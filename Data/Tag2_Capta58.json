Do you think you could do a Carolx reader where the reader is already pregnant when they meet, but has broken up with her long time boyfriend because she wants to keep the baby? And carol falls for her compassionate nature and asks her out on a date (they can meet however lol) and the two fall in love and carol asks if she can help Y/N raise the baby?",
        "answer": "<p><b>\u00a0A/n: Sorry it took a while but this one is looooong. I hope you like it though :)<br/></b></p><p><b>Warning: a little angst, a little fluff, and mentions of an asshole ex-boyfriend</b></p><p><b>Words: 7795<br/></b></p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t do it, Nat. And he said he wasn\u2019t going to be a part of it, so I left.\u201d Sitting on the couch in the common room of the Avenger compound, you held your head in your hands fighting tears. Your best friend, Natasha Romanoff, was sitting next to you listening patiently. She had one hand on your back, slowly moving it up and down. \u201cListen, you can do it. Don\u2019t worry about him, he\u2019s an asshole anyway.\u201d Chuckling\nyou looked up at your friend when another wave of tears hit you. Natasha frowned slightly and moved both her arms around your shaking body.</p><p><br/></p><p>The two of you met years ago, when you were recruited by Fury. Natasha was responsible for your training and even though the training was excruciating, you two became very close friends over the years. When your training was finished, you became Maria Hill\u2019s right hand and therefore worked really close with Fury himself. Every\nonce on a while you would be assigned to the team but normally, you would work\nwith \u201cnormal\u201d agents.</p><p><br/></p><p>That was until a couple of months ago. Captain America himself walked into your office asking for you to work with the Avengers. At first, you declined, knowing it would\nmean a lot more work but when you talked to Nat and Clint about it, you couldn\u2019t stop yourself from agreeing. Much to the dismay of your then boyfriend. You had been together forever and everybody was sure the two of you would end up\ntogether. But he changed when you took the job with the Avengers, blaming you for\nthe downfall of the relationship and accusing you of prioritizing your job. But you stayed together anyway, the thought of breaking up not entering either of your minds.</p><!-- more --><p>Until a day ago. You found out you were pregnant and even though you had mixed feeling about it, you thought with the support you would get from your boyfriend and the\nteam, who had become like a family to you, everything would work out.</p><p><br/></p><p>But when you told him, all hell broke loose. He yelled at you. Screaming you wouldn\u2019t be a good mother and that the child wouldn\u2019t love you because you would be gone all\nthe time anyway. When he grabbed you and tried to convince you to have an abortion,\nyou couldn\u2019t stop yourself. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>You were a trained agent, but your calm and patient character kept you from freaking out\nin situations where other people would throw knives (other people meaning Natasha Romanoff). But this time you had enough, you pulled your arms out of his grip and hit him right in the face. Telling him it was over and that you\u2019d pick up your stuff when he wasn\u2019t home. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>That\u2019s how you ended up at the Avengers compound, knocking on Nat\u2019s door and spending the night in her room. In the morning, after breakfast, you sat on the couch and explained what happened. Natasha almost jumped up, ready to throw a knife at that asshole when she heard how he reacted. She calmed down very fast though when tears of\ndisappointment started rolling down your face. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>So, now you\nwere sitting on the couch, leaning into Natasha, who was trying to calm down. All of a sudden, the newest member of the team, Carol Danvers, came waltzing in. \u201cHey Widow, you ready for me to kick your ass?\u201d The confident smile left her face when she studied the scene in front of her. You quickly moved away from your friend and dropped you head, not wanting her to see the state you were in.</p><p><br/></p><p>You didn\u2019t have the chance to really get to know Carol so far. You were both busy and quite\nfrankly didn\u2019t really have an interest in getting to know each other. You knew, you eventually had to approach the Captain but you had other problems at the time. That\u2019s why now it seemed awkward for Carol to ask if everything was alright, so instead she just stood there, stiff as a broom stick, staring at the two other\nwomen. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right  there Carol. I just have to\u2026\u201d \u201cNo, you should go.\u201d You didn\u2019t let the redhead finish that sentence. You knew that Nat didn\u2019t want to leave you alone, but if you were being honest the sadness you were feeling just a second go, was turning into anger and a workout didn\u2019t sound so bad. \u201cYou know what?\u201d you started while getting up from the couch and walking towards the blonde. \u201cI could use a workout. And you and I don\u2019t know each other well, so let\u2019s do a getting-to-know-each-other spar.\u201d With a confident smile you waited for an answer from the other women, instead Nat spoke up. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cY/n, are you sure you should be working out?\u201d she asked quietly with a pointed look towards your belly. You weren\u2019t showing yet and for that you were happy because you weren\u2019t ready for people to find out about the baby quite yet. So quickly you held her hand up to stop her from continuing. \u201cYes, why wouldn\u2019t I? It\u2019s just a\nlittle work out. It won\u2019t kill me.\u201d Turning your head back to Carol, who had been standing there without saying a word, you raised your eyebrows challenging her. \u201cOr is the mighty space cowboy scared?\u201d <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>That immediately caused a reaction, Carol straightened her back, always ready for a challenge. With a confident smirk on her face she answered. \u201cOh, I\u2019m not scared. But you should be. You don\u2019t know me, and I could kick your ass even without my powers.\u201d Raising\nyour eyebrows again, you hummed and took another step towards the hero. \u201cAlright then, mighty hero. We have special wristbands here that block most of your powers. How about you put one of those on and we make it a fair fight.\u201d <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Slightly taken aback, not knowing of such technology, Carol hesitated a second too long for you not to notice, causing your smirk to deepen. But she quickly shook her head and locked eyes with her opponent. \u201cBring it, Agent y/l/n.\u201d Excited about having a way to get rid of your energy, you walked past Carol making your way to the lab to get the wristband, leaving a stunned Carol and a concerned Natasha in the room. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be too hard on her. You could cause serious damage.\u201d <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Turning around facing the redhead, a frown formed on Carol\u2019s face. \u201cWhat do you mean? I thought she could handle herself.\u201d With a chuckle the former spy took a step towards the other woman. With a quiet voice she hoped no one could hear her. \u201cOh, she can handle herself just fine. I trained her after all. But things are a little\u2026.tense at the moment. So, just don\u2019t hit too hard ok.\u201d <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Seeing the serious expression on Natasha\u2019s face, Carol\u2019s face softened and she nodded her head. She may not know exactly what\u2019s going on but judging on what she walked\nin to, it must be something serious. \u201cYeah. Alright. I\u2019ll watch out.\u201d With a thankful smile Natasha pointed at the door. \u201cWell, then. Let\u2019s go, I\u2019m sure y/n is already waiting.\u201d <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Making their way to the training room, the were met with a sight Carol would always remember as the first moment she felt something stir in her guts. There you\nwere, in the tightest workout clothes that existed and a huge smile on your face. Snapping herself out of the stupor, Carol caught up to the redhead, who was already half way across the room. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cAlright new friend. Put this thing on and let\u2019s get started.\u201d With a suggestive smile you moved the wristband in front of Carol\u2019s face. You felt giddy and excited, almost forgetting about everything with your ex. Even though you didn\u2019t know it yet, it was clear that distracting you from problems would be one of Carol\u2019s specialties. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>With a sigh Carol took the wristband and snapped it around her wrist, immediately feeling some kind of numbness. The power she felt lingering under her skin at all times was gone and she wasn\u2019t sure how she felt about it. With a sympathetic pad to Carol\u2019s shoulder, Natasha started talking. \u201cHere are some ground rules.\u201d <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>You interrupted her with a loud groan and an eyeroll. \u201cWe\u2019re adults, we don\u2019t need\nground rules.\u201d Rolling her eyes Natasha snapped at her \u201cYes, we do. So shut up and listen. Number one: no serious injuries, you tap out if it\u2019s too much. Number two: when I say stop, you both stop. Immediately. And lastly number three: Don\u2019t you dare lose, y/n. I trained you and you have to make me proud.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>With a confident smile you made your way towards the sparring matt. \u201cPlease, Nat. Have\nsome faith.\u201d Shaking her head Carol made her way towards you. The feeling of excitement rushing through your body, ready to kick some ass. The Captain doesn\u2019t like fighting without her powers, it reminded her too much of Yon-rogg and how he would always scold her, but for some reason when she looked at you and how\nyou jumped up and down to warm up a little bit, she couldn\u2019t help but look forward to doing this. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Already in her workout clothes, Carol got ready, standing opposite of you. Natasha was the referee and therefore the one to start the \u201cfight\u201d. \u201cReady,\u2026fight\u201d You started circling each other. You had never fought each other before, so you both had to figure out the other one first. Plus, Carol had to get used to her human strength, which proved to be a little more difficult than she\u2019d expected.</p><p><br/></p><p>After more than a minute, you took a step forward swinging at Carol. She blocked the hit and that\u2019s when the fight got intense. Both of you throwing punches but never landing, yet Carol got closer to beating you than the other way around. It continued like that for a while, until something made Carol lose her focus. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Your shirt started riding up from all the movement and only for a split second, Carol\u2019s eyes left\nyours and instead travelled towards the revealed skin. Barely a second being enough, you landed a hard punch to the other one\u2019s face making her stumble. Followed by a kick to her chest, Carol landed with her back on the mat. Sensing your win, you threw yourself on top of the on the ground laying woman and prevented her from getting up. Without her super strength Carol didn\u2019t stand a chance and reluctantly\ntapped out.</p><p><br/></p><p>With an incredibly wide smile, you jumped off Carol and threw your arms in the air. \u201cYes! I won.\u201d You\nexclaimed loudly. Normally Carol would be pissed, she hated losing but for some\nreason all she could do was smile at your excitement. Priding herself in making\nyou laugh after seeing you cry onto Natasha\u2019s shoulder- Carol walked up to you with her hand held out for a congratulatory handshake. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Instead of taking it, you automatically moved your arms around the blonde woman, embracing her tightly, surprising not just the hero but yourself. \u201cThank you.\u201d The soft whisper hit Carol\u2019s ear causing goosebumps to break out all over her body. Taken aback she just put her arms around your waist and squeezed gently. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>From the corner of the room Natasha just watched the interaction. On the one hand she felt immense proud, but she was also curious about Carol\u2019s reaction. Of course, the spy saw the movement of her eyes and she couldn\u2019t help but wonder what had gotten into the Captain. She had known Carol longer and better than you, but she hadn\u2019t seen her acting like that. Ever. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Before Natasha could finish her line of thought you spoke up, while leaving the embrace with a slight blush on your cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m going to head out now. I have to take care of some stuff but thanks for the workout.\u201d Before Natasha could say anything, you ehad already left the room with a wave towards the other women. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Startling Carol while she was taking off her wristband, Natasha eyed her suspiciously. \u201cHow\ncome you lost? You dominated her most of the time.\u201d Shrugging but not making eye\ncontact the answer was a short one. \u201cYou wanted me to go easy on her, so I did.\u201d <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Before Natasha could say anything in return, that may have caused a conversation Carol didn\u2019t want to have right now, she quickly spoke up again. \u201cWell now that I got my ass kicked, I need to kick someone else\u2019s. Ready to do what we originally\ncame here for.\u201d Moving towards the new Avenger, Natasha forgot what she wanted\nto say and started smirking. \u201cHell yeah. Let\u2019s get this started.\u201d <br/></p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>After the sparring session, you and Carol got a closer. You had picked up most of your stuff from your old apartment and Tony offered you a room on the compound. You felt like you were officially a part of the team. Living at the same place as Carol\nseemed to make the getting to know each other a lot easier. You easily fell into a routine. You\u2019d work out together every other morning, sparring or just doing some weightlifting, of course you took it a little slower but without being suspicious. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Natasha was still the only one who knew about you being pregnant and for the time being that was exactly what you wanted. You weren\u2019t ready to tell anybody, simply because you hadn\u2019t dealt with it yourself. Every once in a while, Natasha would join you other two in the morning but mostly it was just Carol and yourself. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>One day, approximately two weeks after the first time you sparred together, you didn\u2019t show up in the training room. It worried Carol, you were very punctual, in the time you had been training together, there wasn\u2019t on time you came in later than five minutes earlier. When you didn\u2019t show up after fifteen minutes, Carol made her way towards your room, which was on the other side of where Carol had hers. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>She would be lying if she said she wasn\u2019t worried. For some reason you had completely broken down her walls within such a small amount of time. You talked often after your workouts, with Carol sharing things she normally didn\u2019t tell anyone, not even Fury. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>She explained how she got her powers and how she was \u2018abducted\u2019 by the Kree. How lonely and confused she was when she couldn\u2019t remember her past. She talked about her shock, when she read the file about her and Mar-vell\u2019s plans. She went into detail with it all, even the bad stuff she did for the Kree, but you didn\u2019t judge her. Not once. Carol felt safe around you, like she could just be herself and in return she felt like you opened up, too. And you did.</p><p><br/></p><p>You explained how you were recruited and how terrible your training was with Natasha. But it still was the best time you have had; Carol could tell that the bond you two had was very deep and important to both of you. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>One day Carol talked to Natasha about you and she found out that you were pretty much the only one everybody opened up, too. Whether that was Tony about his nightmares about the battle of New York or how he struggled with forgiving Bucky for killing his parents, or Steve talking about his lost life and his ache about what he could\u2019ve had with Peggy. No matter who it was, they all came to you because you made everyone feel the same way Carol felt. Accepted, listened to and most importantly not judged.</p><p><br/></p><p>While the blonde made her way to your room, she couldn\u2019t help but think about how amazing she thinks you are and how important you have become to her. An involuntary smile etched its way onto her face, while her heart sped up with the thought. As soon as she arrived at her destination though, that smile dropped immediately when she heard weird sounds coming from the inside of the room.</p><p><br/></p><p>Quickly she opened the door, when she saw no one in the main part of the room her head snapped to the bathroom when she heard you. Walking towards the sound she sighed in relive when she saw you sitting on the ground. But the feeling quickly changed when she realized what was going on. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>You were leaning over the toilet with your hair pulled back. You didn\u2019t react when Carol entered the room, because you hadn\u2019t even realized someone was there. Only when cold hands made their way onto your forehead and back did you look up into beautiful but concerned, brown eyes. \u201cCarol? What are you doing here?\u201d With a soft voice, that could only be heard because you were so close to each other, the blonde woman answered while continuing to rub your back soothingly.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYou were late, and normally you\u2019re not. I was worried and it seems like I had every right to be.\u201d Before you could formulate an answer, your eyes got big when you felt your stomach grumble. Fast you turned your head back over the toilet, ready to have all remnants of food leave your body. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Silence settled over the two of you, only interrupted by painful souding dry heaving coming from you. When you were sure there was nothing left, that could leave your body, you leaned back against Carol. The warmth coming from her calming you down tremendously. For a moment Carol relished the moment of closeness, realizing how comfortable she felt with your body against hers.</p><p><br/></p><p>She was still worried though and didn\u2019t want you to get cold, so she gently moved some strands of hair out of your pale face and whispered \u201cY/n, hey. Come on you should go to bed and rest.\u201d Huffing, you opened your eyes and sat up, immediately missing the contact. \u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. I just don\u2019t think I can spar with you today.\u201d You didn\u2019t want to have to explain why you didn\u2019t have a fever, so just acting like nothing had happened seemed like a better option.</p><p><br/></p><p>Slowly you started getting up, feeling better already. Seems like pregnant-vomiting doesn\u2019t make you feel as bad as flue-vomiting. Carol on the other hand was still worried, not wanting you to overwhelm yourself, she grabbed your elbow steadying you. \u201cWhoa, whoa. Come on y/n, you\u2019re sick and you need to rest. Not everyone can be immune to everything like I am.\u201d With a smile Carol got you to laugh out loud.</p><p><br/></p><p>In your time together you quickly realized, that was one of the Captains talents. You hadn\u2019t laughed that much in a very long time, at least not with an almost stranger. And Carol took every chance she had to see you smile or hear your laugh. It made her heart jump in excitement, feeling like an addict every time she succeeded. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>You felt the same way, amazed with the fact that Carol could distract you from all of your worries and problems almost as soon as she entered the room. But you were apprehensive, not wanting to act on any of those feelings bubbling under the surface.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Carol.\u201d You snapped at the other woman, instead of thanking her, when she tried to push you towards the bed. Not expecting such a reaction coming from you, since she had never seen you angry or genuinely annoyed, Caro pulled her hands away as if she had been burnt. You hadn\u2019t told anybody about your pregnancy yet, obviously. So far, Natasha was still the only one who knew, and it was important to you that it stayed that way. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Every once in a while, though, you felt like telling Carol everything and be as open with\nher as the Captain was with you, but something kept you from doing so. Maybe your growing feelings for the woman had something to do with it, but again, you wouldn\u2019t even acknowledge them. Who the hell would want to start a relationship with a pregnant woman? <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>But now, standing in you room and looking at Carol, who had a hurt look on her face, you started feeling guilty. Nonetheless you couldn\u2019t bring your mouth to say the words and come clean, scared of the reaction. \u201cAlright, whatever you say.\u201d Turning away from you, Carol made her way towards the door wanting to get out of here. She\nwas surprised by her own feelings, not understanding why she was so hurt by you\nsnapping at her.</p><p><br/></p><p>As the\nguilt spread through your body you wanted to stop the other woman from leaving. You had felt safe leaning against her with Carol\u2019s soft touches against your face, but your body wouldn\u2019t move from the spot two feet away from the bed. You were simply too scared by the outcome of everything. You also had no idea how you would handle the whole baby situation, even though Natasha constantly tried to talk to you about it, you hadn\u2019t even met with a doctor yet. You were completely overwhelmed with everything.</p><p><br/></p><p>You felt\ntears welling up in your eyes when you sat down on your bed, feeling hopeless and absolutely defeated. You were exhausted from all the thinking and the throwing up, so you laid down, curled up into a ball and fell asleep.</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>It had been a couple of days since the incident in your room and you hadn\u2019t talked to each other ever since. So, when you walked into the kitchen one morning, you weren\u2019t prepared to see Carol and Nat sitting on the table having breakfast together. Before you could turn around though, you locked eyes with Carol. Neither could look away, both realizing how much you had missed the other even though it had only been a couple of days. With a deep breath you walked over to the woman who had been on you mind constantly and spoke softly. \u201cHey Carol, uhm could we talk for a second?\u201d <br/></p><p>Sensing the serious tone and knowing what had happened between you two, Natasha cleared her throat. \u201cI have something to do anyway.\u201d With a soft smile to both women and an encouraging squeeze to your hand, the spy made her way out of the kitchen. As soon as she was out of earshot you started rambling. You couldn\u2019t stop the words from literally falling out of your mouth.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m really sorry Carol. I shouldn\u2019t have snapped at you; I know you only wanted to help. I just have a lot on my mind but that\u2019s no excuse. I shouldn\u2019t treat you that way, you deserve better than that. I mean, I know I\u2019ve only known you like three weeks, but I like you. I do. And I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Wide eyed, you stopped yourself from speaking and looked up. When you saw Carol smiling softly, all you could do was exhale loudly, knowing you were forgiven. \u201cI understand. It\u2019s okay just don\u2019t do that again or I\u2019ll kick your ass. This time <b>with</b> my powers.\u201d After a short break, Carol\u2019s smile was replaced with a frown. You felt her heart speed up when Carol got up from her chair and slowly reached out to take your hands, making sure you had every chance to pull away if you wanted to.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYou know, you can talk to me about the things that are on your mind. It may not seem like it sometimes, but I can be a good listener.\u201d A soft chuckle escaped her mouth while she continued rubbing her thumbs over the back of your hands, leaving a tingling sensation behind. It was a tender moment between you two, causing you\nboth to release shaky breaths. You dropped your gaze, fixating on your joint hands. You felt safe, like Carol was going to protect you, and for a split second you allowed your feelings to come rushing to the surface. You were shocked when you realized how hard your heart was pounding, you were sure Carol could hear or maybe even feel it through your hands.</p><p><br/></p><p>But that moment went away quickly, when your mind went back to what was going through your head in the first place. It\u2019s like you were stuck. You wanted to tell Carol everything but you just <b>couldn\u2019t. </b>It was too much, so instead you settled for an answer you hoped would keep Carol from asking again. \u201cI\u2019m sure of that. I just can\u2019t talk about it just yet. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d With an apologetic look, you squeezed Carol\u2019s hands. Nodding slowly, slightly disappointed by the answer, Carol let go of your hands.</p><p><br/></p><p>You felt cold suddenly. Like the warmth left your body when your hands stopped touching. So, you quickly grabbed the retreating hands and took a small step forward. \u201cHow about we go back to our routine? Just minus the sparring, I think I need a break from that. But we could still have lunch and you know hang out or work some files together.\u201d <i>As long as I can spend time with you.</i> The last part was left unsaid, as much as you wanted to voice that thought, you couldn\u2019t.</p><p><br/></p><p>With a smirk on her face Carol pulled you a little closer, surprising you with her boldness.\n\u201cCan\u2019t get enough of me, huh?\u201d \u00a0Her smirk\nturned into a smile when she heard that full laugh she learned to love. Locking eyes, you realized how close you were, but instead of feeling awkward or scared, both of you savored that moment. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>After your talk, things returned to their normal routine. Well, instead of working out together\nyou had lunch every day. You helped Carol understanding the new earth technology and most nights were spent watching movies together. Whenever Carol had a mission, you would welcome her back with food and a chill night, so the hero could relax. It felt nice, domestic even.</p><p><br/></p><p>Months went by like this, and during that time your relationship shifted. It intensified and so did your feelings for each other. It became harder and harder for you to hide them. Added to your inner turmoil, the pregnancy progressed as well. After\na long talk with Natasha, you finally decided to go to a doctor. You checked everything out and felt a weight lift of your shoulders when all the results were positive ones. You hadn\u2019t heard from your ex in weeks. All in all, you felt happy and Carol, of course, had a major part in it.</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>\u201cAlright how about Chicken? Or we could just order some pizza, maybe some French food. No wait, I don\u2019t like that\u201d You walked into the kitchen, Carol following closely. She had an amused smirk on her face listening to you counting all the food options that existed. Halting in the kitchen you turned around with wide\neyes \u201cOh my god, Hot Dogs!\u201d you could eat tons of food at the moment. You craved everything, not so much disgusting things like they always show in movies, but just food in general. So, when Carol told you her mission was cancelled\nyour head immediately went to dinner.</p><p><br/></p><p>With a chuckle Carol put her hands on your shoulders holding you still. \u201cHow about we make it official, huh? I\u2019ll take you to a nice restaurant, you can eat everything you want, and I\u2019ll pay.\u201d Just like that the smile dropped from your face. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>When the realization of being asked out by the woman you most definitely had some feelings for, hit you, your head went blank. Your lack of answer caused Carol to pull back disappointed. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want that, that\u2019s ok. I just thought, you know, in the past week we\u2026..\u201d you had never seen her like this. She was embarrassed but also sad and for some reason you couldn\u2019t live with the fact that you caused\nher to feel that way.</p><p><br/></p><p>Your mouth acted on its own, it had gotten you in trouble before and now there was no difference. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d Silence. Carol\u2019s face went through a hundred emotions within a second and lastly it settled on a confused frown. Closing and opening her mouth she tried to find anything to say but came up with nothing. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Knowing there was no going back now, you realized you had to explain it to her. \u201cRemember the day you walked in on Nat and me? When I was crying?\u201d Carol just nodded, no words escaping her mouth. With a sigh you gently guided her towards the couch. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we sit down.\u201d Slowly you both made your way towards the couch, with you sitting down further away from her than the two of you had gotten used to.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWell, I found out I was pregnant, told my boyfriend and he freaked out, so I broke up with him and came here. Nat took care of me, she\u2019s good at that. When you and I got closer, I wanted to tell you, believe me. But I was scared how you would\nreact. Now, though, I\u2019m starting to show slowly, and I don\u2019t think I could\u2019ve kept it from you any longer.\u201d <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Letting out a long breath you looked at the woman facing you. Her eyes locked onto your belly that was a little rounder than it used to be. Still not responding you continued. You had spilled so much already, may as well go all the way. \u201cI like you, Carol. A lot actually, but I\u2019m pregnant and that\u2019s not going to change. I just don\u2019t want you to do something you or even I could regret in the future.\u201d <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>And that was it. Everything was out in the open and how things would go from here, was solely up to the woman trying to comprehend everything. After minutes of silence you felt yourself tearing up. This was exactly what you feared. Now the only person, you actually liked would walk away from you and you would be alone. Leaning back on\nto the couch you used your hands to cover your face. You couldn\u2019t watch her walk away; it would be too much.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cSo, no sushi then.\u201d Hearing her voice so loud and clear you moved your hands and snapped your head in Carol\u2019s direction. Looking at her face you were the one that was confused now. She showed no sign of shock or anything like that. A\nsoft smile grazed her lips as her eyes locked with yours.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cW-what?\u201d your brain refused to comprehend what was happening. Your heart started fluttering in your chest but you weren\u2019t sure if it was because you were happy or because of your nerves. You couldn\u2019t move, even when Carol scooched closer to you and took your hands in hers. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cListen y/n. Am I surprised about all of this? God, yes. But I don\u2019t care. I like you and you\u2019re important to me so I would like to take you out. We just can\u2019t have\nsushi because pregnant people aren\u2019t aloud to eat that.\u201d Her eyes twinkled in humor. She waited patiently for you to understand that she wouldn\u2019t walk away and simply continued holding on to your hands. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>When you were finally convinced Carol wasn\u2019t joking, the tears in your eyes started falling down. Worried, Carol moved one of her hands to your face and wiped them away. \u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong? Don\u2019t cry, please.\u201d She came even closer and wrapped you in a warm hug. You felt just like the time you had leaned against her on your bathroom floor. Safe. Protected.</p><p><br/></p><p>Not wanting to keep her waiting for an answer, you took a deep breath and pulled away from her, but just enough so you could look her in the eyes. Your hand found her leg that was perched on the couch and you slowly started smiling. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cCongratulations Ms. Danvers, you got yourself a date with a pregnant lady.\u201d Laughing, Carol leaned forward almost touching your lips, making your heart pound like crazy. Before your\nlips touched you could feel her whisper against them instead. \u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure.\u201d With a smirk she pulled away and got up in one swift motion, leaving you on the couch with surprised look on your face.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWell, get ready. We\u2019re leaving in thirty minutes.\u201d Carol quickly made her way out of the room leaving you on the couch. You couldn\u2019t stop the smile from forming on your face. After several weeks of hiding your feelings and ignoring them you could finally\nlet go. You squealed in excitement and threw yourself on the couch. </p><p>Laying there\nyou touched the soft curve of your belly and did something you hadn\u2019t done before.\n\u201cHey little human. Your mommy has a date.\u201d Smiling you slowly moved up to get\nready for dinner. It seemed like a weight was lifted from your chest. You weren\u2019t worried about your ex; you weren\u2019t worried about Carol leaving but most importantly you weren\u2019t worried about the baby that was growing inside of you. For\nthe first time in a while, you felt completely at ease, ready for the future.</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s how he lost his eye. It was Goose.\u201d Shocked, you leaned back in your chair, mouth agape not believing what Carol just told you. Fury lost his eye because of a cat. Well, a Flerken but still. \u201cWow, Fury is one dramatic son of a bitch.\u201d The blonde woman sitting opposite from you broke out into laughter and you couldn\u2019t\nhelp but join.</p><p><br/></p><p>It had been\nan amazing evening; Carol had taken you to a little restaurant not far from the\ncompound. You had talked all night like you always did but this time it felt different,\nmore intimate. You had finally told her the rest of the story about your boyfriend, sharing your thoughts as well as the fear you had because of the baby. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>The superhero surprised you by how head on she was facing the whole situation. At first you thought Carol would just ignore the fact that you were pregnant and act like this was a normal date, but you quickly realized that was not the\ncase. Carol was concerned and even a little overprotective. She even refused to fly you to the restaurant saying it could hurt the baby.</p><p><br/></p><p>You were shaken from your thoughts when a warm hand clasped yours. \u201cHey, are you ok?\u201d She was always so soft with you. Before you had met her all those weeks ago, you had heard people complain about her being arrogant and mean. But in the time\nyou had known her she hadn\u2019t been like that once. Maybe it was because the\nother ones were insecure men that couldn\u2019t handle a woman being stronger than them, but you didn\u2019t care. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>You simply enjoyed the moment and smiled softly at the contact. \u201cI\u2019m fine. In fact, I\u2019m\nhappy. Thank you, Carol.\u201d With a light squeeze to your hand she pulled away, leaving you aching for her touch. \u201cMy pleasure. Shall we?\u201d She pointed at the door and raised her eyebrows. Smiling you nodded and moved to get up.</p><p><br/></p><p>The cold air hit you face as soon as you stepped out, making you shiver. Before you could say something, you felt a warm arm sneak around your waist. Looking down\nyou realized the woman next to you was glowing, making you chuckle. \u201cYou know,\nthis can be very useful.\u201d Smirking down at you she pulled you even closer. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen the rest of it.\u201d <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>With a wink she moved her head to look at the sky. You couldn\u2019t help but look at her, your eyes studying every feature of her face. Starting at her eyes down to the sharp jawline, that made your knees buckle. When your eyes landed on her lips you noticed they were moving. When she looked down at you with amused eyes and a smirk you\ncouldn\u2019t stop the red heat rising in your face.</p><p><br/></p><p>Stopping her movement Carol stepped in front of you, her hand not leaving its place around your waist, and her other hand coming up to touch the side of your face. Her boldness surprised you once again but all you could focus on were the lips that were so\nclose to your own. Leaning in closer you heard her whisper. \u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>You couldn\u2019t help but melt at the question. You couldn\u2019t remember a single time your ex ever asked for consent, not that he ever did something without it, but the specific\nquestion was never asked. Without answering you leaned in, capturing the awaiting lips in your own. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>With the first touch you could feel tingles all over your body. You moved your hand to her neck and one sunk in her hair, while Carol tightened her grip around your waist with both arms and pulled you flush against her. Your lips moved in unison and when Carol asked for entrance by biting your lower lip, you couldn\u2019t help but moan, opening your mouth. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>You didn\u2019t know how long you were standing there but when the kiss broke because of the need for air, you leaned your forehead against hers. Staying in the tight embrace, Carol moved in for another short, soft kiss before she spoke up. \u201cWe\nshould go. I don\u2019t want you getting sick for real this time.\u201d You placed one more kiss on her lips before you agreed and the two of you made your way back\nhome. The entire time, the glowing arm around you didn\u2019t leave its place.</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>After the first date things developed fairly quickly, but not in an uncomfortable pace. Soon you both realized how time flies when you had to go to the doctor to get checked out. You had just entered the sixth month and you were showing clearly. In the\ntime between the first date and now, you and Carol had taken big steps with\neach other. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Soft kisses turned into make out sessions and those turned into sex. Sex with Carol was unlike\nanything you had ever felt. From the very beginning she made sure that you felt\nsafe and comfortable but at the same time she was relentless. You were impressed with how soft she was when it came to your pregnancy though. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>One night\nwhen you were laying in bed, her arm beneath your neck and a hand on your belly, you were ready to fall asleep when suddenly Carol\u2019s quick movement startled you. Within a second, she had sat up and had both of her hands on your belly. Moving her head between your face and your belly she whispered loudly. \u201cDid you see\nthat? Did you <b>feel </b>that?\u201d Confused\nyou were going to ask her what she meant when it happened again.</p><p><br/></p><p> A soft movement in your belly made you realize what she meant. \u201cOh that? That\u2019s been going on for a couple of days now, I think it\u2019s the baby kicking.\u201d You tried to move into a sitting position but Carol\u2019s face made you stop. Her excited smile she had been wearing the moment she moved\nup, was replaced by a hurt frown. You didn\u2019t understand what had happened, so you lifted your hand and put it on hers on your belly. \u201cWhat is it, Carol?\u201d No answer. The only thing that changed was the hands leaving your belly, leaving a cold feeling in the place where they had been before. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Carol moved away from you and got up from the bed. You only watched how she started pacing in front of your bed with her hands on her forehead. \u201cCarol? What is wrong?\u201d Fear rushed\nthrough your body and you could hear your own heartbeat. This was the moment. Carol was going to leave, she finally understood how serious this is and now she changed\nher mind and wants to go. You couldn\u2019t believe it. Tears gathered in your eyes when the realization hit you. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>You wanted to get up and yell at her for playing with you for <b>weeks, </b>making you think she was going to be there. But you were too weak. The cold fear made you freeze and stay seated on the bed. When you didn\u2019t\nhear her steps echoing through the room anymore, you looked up. What you saw,\nsurprised you. There she was, the strongest Avenger, with tears rolling down her\nface. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me? I thought we\u2026.. I thought you and I, we \u2026..Why\ndidn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Now you were speechless, all this time you had thought she was going to leave anyway,\nso you didn\u2019t include her in the first place. You remembered the fight you had\nwhen you took Natasha with you to the doctor instead of her. You didn\u2019t understand why she was so mad about it, because you didn\u2019t <b>try </b>to understand. Having been so caught up in your own head, you completely disregarded her feelings.</p><p><br/></p><p>Before you\ncould even start to stutter an answer, Carol opened her mouth again, breaking your heart. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to be involved, just tell me. I\u2019m a big girl, I can handle it, but don\u2019t you dare play with me. It\u2019s not fair.\u201d You didn\u2019t\nknow what to say. Your head was all over the place, your heart was beating faster when you finally understood, that Carol was all in. She <b>wanted </b>to be involved. She <b>wanted </b>to be there, and you wouldn\u2019t let her.</p><p><br/></p><p>Determined you got up from the bed and walked towards the woman you now knew you loved. \u201cCarol, I \u2026\u201d a groan interrupted your words. Pain. You belly was hurting, something was wrong. You placed your hands on your belly and looked up at Carol with wide eyes. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cCarol,\nsomething is wrong. It hurts.\u201d As if the last minutes hadn\u2019t happened Carol took a step forward and took your face in her hands. \u201cStay calm, I\u2019m going to get you to the hospital.\u201d Now she was in her element. Staying calm under\npressure was her job and she couldn\u2019t panic now. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>She picked\nyou up carefully, wincing when another contraction (at least you assumed it was\none) forced a gasp out of your mouth. \u201cBreathe. We\u2019ll be right there. Just keep breathing.\u201d Only when Carol started glowing, you realized you were in the air. Just a few minutes later you already landed in front of the hospital, with you\nin her arms, Carol made her way inside. Walking up to the nurse, she frantically started talking. \u201cShe\u2019s pregnant, in her second trimester and she\u2019s feeling contractions, I think. It\u2019s too soon. You need to help her.\u201d <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>The nurse and Carol started arguing but you weren\u2019t listening. The contractions (?)\nstopped but you were tired anyway. You were going to sleep after all before this whole debacle happened. You slowly closed your eyes ready to fall asleep in your girlfriend\u2019s arms when you were rudely awoken. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>You opened your eyes when the warmth left your body and you were placed in a hospital bed with Carol by your side. She was nervous, she played with her hands and had a very focused look on her face. She always got that, when she needed to keep her cool. You couldn\u2019t keep your eyes away from her, watching her with adoration visible on your face.</p><p><br/></p><p>When the doctor left after he checked you out, a long breath of relief left both of your\nmouths. Diagnose: Braxton hicks contractions. False alarm and no danger whatsoever. You should be happy, and you were, but your thoughts were somewhere else. So were Carol\u2019s, she was still nervous, slightly less now that she knew the baby was safe, but she was thinking about what to say.</p><p><br/></p><p>Taking a\ndeep breath Carol broke her silence. \u201cI need you to listen to me now. I love you. I do. It\u2019s crazy, we\u2019ve known each other for less than a year but I can\u2019t help feeling what I feel.\u201d Your heart started pounding, speechless you were laying there not able to make a sound. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>You didn\u2019t need to, the Hero wasn\u2019t done yet. With a soft smile on her face she laid her\nhands on top of your belly and continued with a soft voice. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI also\nlove this baby. I want to be a part of this. I knew what I was getting into when I went on that date with you. And I wouldn\u2019t change it for the world. I want to be there for this child, raising it. With you. But if you don\u2019t want that then you have to tell me because if you tell me when this kid is older\u2026. I don\u2019t think I can handle it. It would mean losing the child and losing you. I can\u2019t do that, y/n. So, tell me what you want. You decide.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>You didn\u2019t notice\nthe tears rolling down your face until a sob wrecked through your body. The things\nyou felt were so intense, you didn\u2019t even know you could feel so much at once. Love. Relief. Joy. Happiness. More love. Now you just had to put it into words, and that was harder than you thought.</p><p><br/></p><p>Carol was waiting patiently, sitting in front of you with her hands clasped. She wanted to dry your tears and make you stop crying but she wasn\u2019t sure if that would be welcomed anymore. You sat up slowly and moved your legs over the bed, patting\nthe bed next to you. Carol moved carefully around you and sat down, careful not to touch you, however hard it was for her. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>With a light chuckle you took her hands and as soon as your eyes locked you knew what you had to say. Everything that was in your head came pouring out.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI was scared you\u2019d leave. I didn\u2019t even realize I had excluded you from the whole thing\nuntil you were pacing in front of the bed. Of course, I want you to be a part of this. You are the softest, most patient and loving person I\u2019ve ever met. This baby will be lucky to have you raise it. Cause that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to\ndo. Raise it. Together.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Carol couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore. She grabbed your face and crashed your lips together, tasting both of you tears, while you moved with each other. Breaking the kiss and leaning your foreheads against each other you whispered softly \u201c I love you, too.\u201d <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>The smile that broke out on both of your faces made the following kisses a little awkward, but neither of you cared. You had a future; you were on the same page.\nYou were going to be parents.</p>",

You found out you were pregnant and even though you had mixed feeling about it, you thought with the support you would get from your boyfriend and the\nteam, who had become like a family to you, everything would work out.</p><p><br></p><p>But when you told him, all hell broke loose. He yelled at you. Screaming you wouldn\u2019t be a good mother and that the child wouldn\u2019t love you because you would be gone all\nthe time anyway. When he grabbed you and tried to convince you to have an abortion,\nyou couldn\u2019t stop yourself. <br></p><p><br></p><p>You were a trained agent, but your calm and patient character kept you from freaking out\nin situations where other people would throw knives (other people meaning Natasha Romanoff). But this time you had enough, you pulled your arms out of his grip and hit him right in the face. Telling him it was over and that you\u2019d pick up your stuff when he wasn\u2019t home. <br></p><p><br></p><p>That\u2019s how you ended up at the Avengers compound, knocking on Nat\u2019s door and spending the night in her room. In the morning, after breakfast, you sat on the couch and explained what happened. Natasha almost jumped up, ready to throw a knife at that asshole when she heard how he reacted. She calmed down very fast though when tears of\ndisappointment started rolling down your face. <br></p><p><br></p><p>So, now you\nwere sitting on the couch, leaning into Natasha, who was trying to calm down. All of a sudden, the newest member of the team, Carol Danvers, came waltzing in. \u201cHey Widow, you ready for me to kick your ass?\u201d The confident smile left her face when she studied the scene in front of her. You quickly moved away from your friend and dropped you head, not wanting her to see the state you were in.</p><p><br></p><p>You didn\u2019t have the chance to really get to know Carol so far. You were both busy and quite\nfrankly didn\u2019t really have an interest in getting to know each other. You knew, you eventually had to approach the Captain but you had other problems at the time. That\u2019s why now it seemed awkward for Carol to ask if everything was alright, so instead she just stood there, stiff as a broom stick, staring at the two other\nwomen. <br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right  there Carol. I just have to\u2026\u201d \u201cNo, you should go.\u201d You didn\u2019t let the redhead finish that sentence. You knew that Nat didn\u2019t want to leave you alone, but if you were being honest the sadness you were feeling just a second go, was turning into anger and a workout didn\u2019t sound so bad. \u201cYou know what?\u201d you started while getting up from the couch and walking towards the blonde. \u201cI could use a workout. And you and I don\u2019t know each other well, so let\u2019s do a getting-to-know-each-other spar.\u201d With a confident smile you waited for an answer from the other women, instead Nat spoke up. <br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cY/n, are you sure you should be working out?\u201d she asked quietly with a pointed look towards your belly. You weren\u2019t showing yet and for that you were happy because you weren\u2019t ready for people to find out about the baby quite yet. So quickly you held her hand up to stop her from continuing. \u201cYes, why wouldn\u2019t I? It\u2019s just a\nlittle work out. It won\u2019t kill me.\u201d Turning your head back to Carol, who had been standing there without saying a word, you raised your eyebrows challenging her. \u201cOr is the mighty space cowboy scared?\u201d <br></p><p><br></p><p>That immediately caused a reaction, Carol straightened her back, always ready for a challenge. With a confident smirk on her face she answered. \u201cOh, I\u2019m not scared. But you should be. You don\u2019t know me, and I could kick your ass even without my powers.\u201d Raising\nyour eyebrows again, you hummed and took another step towards the hero. \u201cAlright then, mighty hero. We have special wristbands here that block most of your powers. How about you put one of those on and we make it a fair fight.\u201d <br></p><p><br></p><p>Slightly taken aback, not knowing of such technology, Carol hesitated a second too long for you not to notice, causing your smirk to deepen. But she quickly shook her head and locked eyes with her opponent. \u201cBring it, Agent y/l/n.\u201d Excited about having a way to get rid of your energy, you walked past Carol making your way to the lab to get the wristband, leaving a stunned Carol and a concerned Natasha in the room. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be too hard on her. You could cause serious damage.\u201d <br></p><p><br></p><p>Turning around facing the redhead, a frown formed on Carol\u2019s face. \u201cWhat do you mean? I thought she could handle herself.\u201d With a chuckle the former spy took a step towards the other woman. With a quiet voice she hoped no one could hear her. \u201cOh, she can handle herself just fine. I trained her after all. But things are a little\u2026.tense at the moment. So, just don\u2019t hit too hard ok.\u201d <br></p><p><br></p><p>Seeing the serious expression on Natasha\u2019s face, Carol\u2019s face softened and she nodded her head. She may not know exactly what\u2019s going on but judging on what she walked\nin to, it must be something serious. \u201cYeah. Alright. I\u2019ll watch out.\u201d With a thankful smile Natasha pointed at the door. \u201cWell, then. Let\u2019s go, I\u2019m sure y/n is already waiting.\u201d <br></p><p><br></p><p>Making their way to the training room, the were met with a sight Carol would always remember as the first moment she felt something stir in her guts. There you\nwere, in the tightest workout clothes that existed and a huge smile on your face. Snapping herself out of the stupor, Carol caught up to the redhead, who was already half way across the room. <br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAlright new friend. Put this thing on and let\u2019s get started.\u201d With a suggestive smile you moved the wristband in front of Carol\u2019s face. You felt giddy and excited, almost forgetting about everything with your ex. Even though you didn\u2019t know it yet, it was clear that distracting you from problems would be one of Carol\u2019s specialties. <br></p><p><br></p><p>With a sigh Carol took the wristband and snapped it around her wrist, immediately feeling some kind of numbness. The power she felt lingering under her skin at all times was gone and she wasn\u2019t sure how she felt about it. With a sympathetic pad to Carol\u2019s shoulder, Natasha started talking. \u201cHere are some ground rules.\u201d <br></p><p><br></p><p>You interrupted her with a loud groan and an eyeroll. \u201cWe\u2019re adults, we don\u2019t need\nground rules.\u201d Rolling her eyes Natasha snapped at her \u201cYes, we do. So shut up and listen. Number one: no serious injuries, you tap out if it\u2019s too much. Number two: when I say stop, you both stop. Immediately. And lastly number three: Don\u2019t you dare lose, y/n. I trained you and you have to make me proud.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>With a confident smile you made your way towards the sparring matt. \u201cPlease, Nat. Have\nsome faith.\u201d Shaking her head Carol made her way towards you. The feeling of excitement rushing through your body, ready to kick some ass. The Captain doesn\u2019t like fighting without her powers, it reminded her too much of Yon-rogg and how he would always scold her, but for some reason when she looked at you and how\nyou jumped up and down to warm up a little bit, she couldn\u2019t help but look forward to doing this. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Already in her workout clothes, Carol got ready, standing opposite of you. Natasha was the referee and therefore the one to start the \u201cfight\u201d. \u201cReady,\u2026fight\u201d You started circling each other. You had never fought each other before, so you both had to figure out the other one first. Plus, Carol had to get used to her human strength, which proved to be a little more difficult than she\u2019d expected.</p><p><br></p><p>After more than a minute, you took a step forward swinging at Carol. She blocked the hit and that\u2019s when the fight got intense. Both of you throwing punches but never landing, yet Carol got closer to beating you than the other way around. It continued like that for a while, until something made Carol lose her focus. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Your shirt started riding up from all the movement and only for a split second, Carol\u2019s eyes left\nyours and instead travelled towards the revealed skin. Barely a second being enough, you landed a hard punch to the other one\u2019s face making her stumble. Followed by a kick to her chest, Carol landed with her back on the mat. Sensing your win, you threw yourself on top of the on the ground laying woman and prevented her from getting up. Without her super strength Carol didn\u2019t stand a chance and reluctantly\ntapped out.</p><p><br></p><p>With an incredibly wide smile, you jumped off Carol and threw your arms in the air. \u201cYes! I won.\u201d You\nexclaimed loudly. Normally Carol would be pissed, she hated losing but for some\nreason all she could do was smile at your excitement. Priding herself in making\nyou laugh after seeing you cry onto Natasha\u2019s shoulder- Carol walked up to you with her hand held out for a congratulatory handshake. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Instead of taking it, you automatically moved your arms around the blonde woman, embracing her tightly, surprising not just the hero but yourself. \u201cThank you.\u201d The soft whisper hit Carol\u2019s ear causing goosebumps to break out all over her body. Taken aback she just put her arms around your waist and squeezed gently. <br></p><p><br></p><p>From the corner of the room Natasha just watched the interaction. On the one hand she felt immense proud, but she was also curious about Carol\u2019s reaction. Of course, the spy saw the movement of her eyes and she couldn\u2019t help but wonder what had gotten into the Captain. She had known Carol longer and better than you, but she hadn\u2019t seen her acting like that. Ever. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Before Natasha could finish her line of thought you spoke up, while leaving the embrace with a slight blush on your cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m going to head out now. I have to take care of some stuff but thanks for the workout.\u201d Before Natasha could say anything, you ehad already left the room with a wave towards the other women. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Startling Carol while she was taking off her wristband, Natasha eyed her suspiciously. \u201cHow\ncome you lost? You dominated her most of the time.\u201d Shrugging but not making eye\ncontact the answer was a short one. \u201cYou wanted me to go easy on her, so I did.\u201d <br></p><p><br></p><p>Before Natasha could say anything in return, that may have caused a conversation Carol didn\u2019t want to have right now, she quickly spoke up again. \u201cWell now that I got my ass kicked, I need to kick someone else\u2019s. Ready to do what we originally\ncame here for.\u201d Moving towards the new Avenger, Natasha forgot what she wanted\nto say and started smirking. \u201cHell yeah. Let\u2019s get this started.\u201d <br></p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>After the sparring session, you and Carol got a closer. You had picked up most of your stuff from your old apartment and Tony offered you a room on the compound. You felt like you were officially a part of the team. Living at the same place as Carol\nseemed to make the getting to know each other a lot easier. You easily fell into a routine. You\u2019d work out together every other morning, sparring or just doing some weightlifting, of course you took it a little slower but without being suspicious. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Natasha was still the only one who knew about you being pregnant and for the time being that was exactly what you wanted. You weren\u2019t ready to tell anybody, simply because you hadn\u2019t dealt with it yourself. Every once in a while, Natasha would join you other two in the morning but mostly it was just Carol and yourself. <br></p><p><br></p><p>One day, approximately two weeks after the first time you sparred together, you didn\u2019t show up in the training room. It worried Carol, you were very punctual, in the time you had been training together, there wasn\u2019t on time you came in later than five minutes earlier. When you didn\u2019t show up after fifteen minutes, Carol made her way towards your room, which was on the other side of where Carol had hers. <br></p><p><br></p><p>She would be lying if she said she wasn\u2019t worried. For some reason you had completely broken down her walls within such a small amount of time. You talked often after your workouts, with Carol sharing things she normally didn\u2019t tell anyone, not even Fury. <br></p><p><br></p><p>She explained how she got her powers and how she was \u2018abducted\u2019 by the Kree. How lonely and confused she was when she couldn\u2019t remember her past. She talked about her shock, when she read the file about her and Mar-vell\u2019s plans. She went into detail with it all, even the bad stuff she did for the Kree, but you didn\u2019t judge her. Not once. Carol felt safe around you, like she could just be herself and in return she felt like you opened up, too. And you did.</p><p><br></p><p>You explained how you were recruited and how terrible your training was with Natasha. But it still was the best time you have had; Carol could tell that the bond you two had was very deep and important to both of you. <br></p><p><br></p><p>One day Carol talked to Natasha about you and she found out that you were pretty much the only one everybody opened up, too. Whether that was Tony about his nightmares about the battle of New York or how he struggled with forgiving Bucky for killing his parents, or Steve talking about his lost life and his ache about what he could\u2019ve had with Peggy. No matter who it was, they all came to you because you made everyone feel the same way Carol felt. Accepted, listened to and most importantly not judged.</p><p><br></p><p>While the blonde made her way to your room, she couldn\u2019t help but think about how amazing she thinks you are and how important you have become to her. An involuntary smile etched its way onto her face, while her heart sped up with the thought. As soon as she arrived at her destination though, that smile dropped immediately when she heard weird sounds coming from the inside of the room.</p><p><br></p><p>Quickly she opened the door, when she saw no one in the main part of the room her head snapped to the bathroom when she heard you. Walking towards the sound she sighed in relive when she saw you sitting on the ground. But the feeling quickly changed when she realized what was going on. <br></p><p><br></p><p>You were leaning over the toilet with your hair pulled back. You didn\u2019t react when Carol entered the room, because you hadn\u2019t even realized someone was there. Only when cold hands made their way onto your forehead and back did you look up into beautiful but concerned, brown eyes. \u201cCarol? What are you doing here?\u201d With a soft voice, that could only be heard because you were so close to each other, the blonde woman answered while continuing to rub your back soothingly.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou were late, and normally you\u2019re not. I was worried and it seems like I had every right to be.\u201d Before you could formulate an answer, your eyes got big when you felt your stomach grumble. Fast you turned your head back over the toilet, ready to have all remnants of food leave your body. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Silence settled over the two of you, only interrupted by painful souding dry heaving coming from you. When you were sure there was nothing left, that could leave your body, you leaned back against Carol. The warmth coming from her calming you down tremendously. For a moment Carol relished the moment of closeness, realizing how comfortable she felt with your body against hers.</p><p><br></p><p>She was still worried though and didn\u2019t want you to get cold, so she gently moved some strands of hair out of your pale face and whispered \u201cY/n, hey. Come on you should go to bed and rest.\u201d Huffing, you opened your eyes and sat up, immediately missing the contact. \u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. I just don\u2019t think I can spar with you today.\u201d You didn\u2019t want to have to explain why you didn\u2019t have a fever, so just acting like nothing had happened seemed like a better option.</p><p><br></p><p>Slowly you started getting up, feeling better already. Seems like pregnant-vomiting doesn\u2019t make you feel as bad as flue-vomiting. Carol on the other hand was still worried, not wanting you to overwhelm yourself, she grabbed your elbow steadying you. \u201cWhoa, whoa. Come on y/n, you\u2019re sick and you need to rest. Not everyone can be immune to everything like I am.\u201d With a smile Carol got you to laugh out loud.</p><p><br></p><p>In your time together you quickly realized, that was one of the Captains talents. You hadn\u2019t laughed that much in a very long time, at least not with an almost stranger. And Carol took every chance she had to see you smile or hear your laugh. It made her heart jump in excitement, feeling like an addict every time she succeeded. <br></p><p><br></p><p>You felt the same way, amazed with the fact that Carol could distract you from all of your worries and problems almost as soon as she entered the room. But you were apprehensive, not wanting to act on any of those feelings bubbling under the surface.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Carol.\u201d You snapped at the other woman, instead of thanking her, when she tried to push you towards the bed. Not expecting such a reaction coming from you, since she had never seen you angry or genuinely annoyed, Caro pulled her hands away as if she had been burnt. You hadn\u2019t told anybody about your pregnancy yet, obviously. So far, Natasha was still the only one who knew, and it was important to you that it stayed that way. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Every once in a while, though, you felt like telling Carol everything and be as open with\nher as the Captain was with you, but something kept you from doing so. Maybe your growing feelings for the woman had something to do with it, but again, you wouldn\u2019t even acknowledge them. Who the hell would want to start a relationship with a pregnant woman? <br></p><p><br></p><p>But now, standing in you room and looking at Carol, who had a hurt look on her face, you started feeling guilty. Nonetheless you couldn\u2019t bring your mouth to say the words and come clean, scared of the reaction. \u201cAlright, whatever you say.\u201d Turning away from you, Carol made her way towards the door wanting to get out of here. She\nwas surprised by her own feelings, not understanding why she was so hurt by you\nsnapping at her.</p><p><br></p><p>As the\nguilt spread through your body you wanted to stop the other woman from leaving. You had felt safe leaning against her with Carol\u2019s soft touches against your face, but your body wouldn\u2019t move from the spot two feet away from the bed. You were simply too scared by the outcome of everything. You also had no idea how you would handle the whole baby situation, even though Natasha constantly tried to talk to you about it, you hadn\u2019t even met with a doctor yet. You were completely overwhelmed with everything.</p><p><br></p><p>You felt\ntears welling up in your eyes when you sat down on your bed, feeling hopeless and absolutely defeated. You were exhausted from all the thinking and the throwing up, so you laid down, curled up into a ball and fell asleep.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>It had been a couple of days since the incident in your room and you hadn\u2019t talked to each other ever since. So, when you walked into the kitchen one morning, you weren\u2019t prepared to see Carol and Nat sitting on the table having breakfast together. Before you could turn around though, you locked eyes with Carol. Neither could look away, both realizing how much you had missed the other even though it had only been a couple of days. With a deep breath you walked over to the woman who had been on you mind constantly and spoke softly. \u201cHey Carol, uhm could we talk for a second?\u201d <br></p><p>Sensing the serious tone and knowing what had happened between you two, Natasha cleared her throat. \u201cI have something to do anyway.\u201d With a soft smile to both women and an encouraging squeeze to your hand, the spy made her way out of the kitchen. As soon as she was out of earshot you started rambling. You couldn\u2019t stop the words from literally falling out of your mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m really sorry Carol. I shouldn\u2019t have snapped at you; I know you only wanted to help. I just have a lot on my mind but that\u2019s no excuse. I shouldn\u2019t treat you that way, you deserve better than that. I mean, I know I\u2019ve only known you like three weeks, but I like you. I do. And I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Wide eyed, you stopped yourself from speaking and looked up. When you saw Carol smiling softly, all you could do was exhale loudly, knowing you were forgiven. \u201cI understand. It\u2019s okay just don\u2019t do that again or I\u2019ll kick your ass. This time <b>with</b> my powers.\u201d After a short break, Carol\u2019s smile was replaced with a frown. You felt her heart speed up when Carol got up from her chair and slowly reached out to take your hands, making sure you had every chance to pull away if you wanted to.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou know, you can talk to me about the things that are on your mind. It may not seem like it sometimes, but I can be a good listener.\u201d A soft chuckle escaped her mouth while she continued rubbing her thumbs over the back of your hands, leaving a tingling sensation behind. It was a tender moment between you two, causing you\nboth to release shaky breaths. You dropped your gaze, fixating on your joint hands. You felt safe, like Carol was going to protect you, and for a split second you allowed your feelings to come rushing to the surface. You were shocked when you realized how hard your heart was pounding, you were sure Carol could hear or maybe even feel it through your hands.</p><p><br></p><p>But that moment went away quickly, when your mind went back to what was going through your head in the first place. It\u2019s like you were stuck. You wanted to tell Carol everything but you just <b>couldn\u2019t. </b>It was too much, so instead you settled for an answer you hoped would keep Carol from asking again. \u201cI\u2019m sure of that. I just can\u2019t talk about it just yet. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d With an apologetic look, you squeezed Carol\u2019s hands. Nodding slowly, slightly disappointed by the answer, Carol let go of your hands.</p><p><br></p><p>You felt cold suddenly. Like the warmth left your body when your hands stopped touching. So, you quickly grabbed the retreating hands and took a small step forward. \u201cHow about we go back to our routine? Just minus the sparring, I think I need a break from that. But we could still have lunch and you know hang out or work some files together.\u201d <i>As long as I can spend time with you.</i> The last part was left unsaid, as much as you wanted to voice that thought, you couldn\u2019t.</p><p><br></p><p>With a smirk on her face Carol pulled you a little closer, surprising you with her boldness.\n\u201cCan\u2019t get enough of me, huh?\u201d \u00a0Her smirk\nturned into a smile when she heard that full laugh she learned to love. Locking eyes, you realized how close you were, but instead of feeling awkward or scared, both of you savored that moment. <br></p><p><br></p><p>After your talk, things returned to their normal routine. Well, instead of working out together\nyou had lunch every day. You helped Carol understanding the new earth technology and most nights were spent watching movies together. Whenever Carol had a mission, you would welcome her back with food and a chill night, so the hero could relax. It felt nice, domestic even.</p><p><br></p><p>Months went by like this, and during that time your relationship shifted. It intensified and so did your feelings for each other. It became harder and harder for you to hide them. Added to your inner turmoil, the pregnancy progressed as well. After\na long talk with Natasha, you finally decided to go to a doctor. You checked everything out and felt a weight lift of your shoulders when all the results were positive ones. You hadn\u2019t heard from your ex in weeks. All in all, you felt happy and Carol, of course, had a major part in it.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>\u201cAlright how about Chicken? Or we could just order some pizza, maybe some French food. No wait, I don\u2019t like that\u201d You walked into the kitchen, Carol following closely. She had an amused smirk on her face listening to you counting all the food options that existed. Halting in the kitchen you turned around with wide\neyes \u201cOh my god, Hot Dogs!\u201d you could eat tons of food at the moment. You craved everything, not so much disgusting things like they always show in movies, but just food in general. So, when Carol told you her mission was cancelled\nyour head immediately went to dinner.</p><p><br></p><p>With a chuckle Carol put her hands on your shoulders holding you still. \u201cHow about we make it official, huh? I\u2019ll take you to a nice restaurant, you can eat everything you want, and I\u2019ll pay.\u201d Just like that the smile dropped from your face. <br></p><p><br></p><p>When the realization of being asked out by the woman you most definitely had some feelings for, hit you, your head went blank. Your lack of answer caused Carol to pull back disappointed. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want that, that\u2019s ok. I just thought, you know, in the past week we\u2026..\u201d you had never seen her like this. She was embarrassed but also sad and for some reason you couldn\u2019t live with the fact that you caused\nher to feel that way.</p><p><br></p><p>Your mouth acted on its own, it had gotten you in trouble before and now there was no difference. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d Silence. Carol\u2019s face went through a hundred emotions within a second and lastly it settled on a confused frown. Closing and opening her mouth she tried to find anything to say but came up with nothing. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Knowing there was no going back now, you realized you had to explain it to her. \u201cRemember the day you walked in on Nat and me? When I was crying?\u201d Carol just nodded, no words escaping her mouth. With a sigh you gently guided her towards the couch. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we sit down.\u201d Slowly you both made your way towards the couch, with you sitting down further away from her than the two of you had gotten used to.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWell, I found out I was pregnant, told my boyfriend and he freaked out, so I broke up with him and came here. Nat took care of me, she\u2019s good at that. When you and I got closer, I wanted to tell you, believe me. But I was scared how you would\nreact. Now, though, I\u2019m starting to show slowly, and I don\u2019t think I could\u2019ve kept it from you any longer.\u201d <br></p><p><br></p><p>Letting out a long breath you looked at the woman facing you. Her eyes locked onto your belly that was a little rounder than it used to be. Still not responding you continued. You had spilled so much already, may as well go all the way. \u201cI like you, Carol. A lot actually, but I\u2019m pregnant and that\u2019s not going to change. I just don\u2019t want you to do something you or even I could regret in the future.\u201d <br></p><p><br></p><p>And that was it. Everything was out in the open and how things would go from here, was solely up to the woman trying to comprehend everything. After minutes of silence you felt yourself tearing up. This was exactly what you feared. Now the only person, you actually liked would walk away from you and you would be alone. Leaning back on\nto the couch you used your hands to cover your face. You couldn\u2019t watch her walk away; it would be too much.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSo, no sushi then.\u201d Hearing her voice so loud and clear you moved your hands and snapped your head in Carol\u2019s direction. Looking at her face you were the one that was confused now. She showed no sign of shock or anything like that. A\nsoft smile grazed her lips as her eyes locked with yours.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cW-what?\u201d your brain refused to comprehend what was happening. Your heart started fluttering in your chest but you weren\u2019t sure if it was because you were happy or because of your nerves. You couldn\u2019t move, even when Carol scooched closer to you and took your hands in hers. <br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cListen y/n. Am I surprised about all of this? God, yes. But I don\u2019t care. I like you and you\u2019re important to me so I would like to take you out. We just can\u2019t have\nsushi because pregnant people aren\u2019t aloud to eat that.\u201d Her eyes twinkled in humor. She waited patiently for you to understand that she wouldn\u2019t walk away and simply continued holding on to your hands. <br></p><p><br></p><p>When you were finally convinced Carol wasn\u2019t joking, the tears in your eyes started falling down. Worried, Carol moved one of her hands to your face and wiped them away. \u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong? Don\u2019t cry, please.\u201d She came even closer and wrapped you in a warm hug. You felt just like the time you had leaned against her on your bathroom floor. Safe. Protected.</p><p><br></p><p>Not wanting to keep her waiting for an answer, you took a deep breath and pulled away from her, but just enough so you could look her in the eyes. Your hand found her leg that was perched on the couch and you slowly started smiling. <br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cCongratulations Ms. Danvers, you got yourself a date with a pregnant lady.\u201d Laughing, Carol leaned forward almost touching your lips, making your heart pound like crazy. Before your\nlips touched you could feel her whisper against them instead. \u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure.\u201d With a smirk she pulled away and got up in one swift motion, leaving you on the couch with surprised look on your face.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWell, get ready. We\u2019re leaving in thirty minutes.\u201d Carol quickly made her way out of the room leaving you on the couch. You couldn\u2019t stop the smile from forming on your face. After several weeks of hiding your feelings and ignoring them you could finally\nlet go. You squealed in excitement and threw yourself on the couch. </p><p>Laying there\nyou touched the soft curve of your belly and did something you hadn\u2019t done before.\n\u201cHey little human. Your mommy has a date.\u201d Smiling you slowly moved up to get\nready for dinner. It seemed like a weight was lifted from your chest. You weren\u2019t worried about your ex; you weren\u2019t worried about Carol leaving but most importantly you weren\u2019t worried about the baby that was growing inside of you. For\nthe first time in a while, you felt completely at ease, ready for the future.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s how he lost his eye. It was Goose.\u201d Shocked, you leaned back in your chair, mouth agape not believing what Carol just told you. Fury lost his eye because of a cat. Well, a Flerken but still. \u201cWow, Fury is one dramatic son of a bitch.\u201d The blonde woman sitting opposite from you broke out into laughter and you couldn\u2019t\nhelp but join.</p><p><br></p><p>It had been\nan amazing evening; Carol had taken you to a little restaurant not far from the\ncompound. You had talked all night like you always did but this time it felt different,\nmore intimate. You had finally told her the rest of the story about your boyfriend, sharing your thoughts as well as the fear you had because of the baby. <br></p><p><br></p><p>The superhero surprised you by how head on she was facing the whole situation. At first you thought Carol would just ignore the fact that you were pregnant and act like this was a normal date, but you quickly realized that was not the\ncase. Carol was concerned and even a little overprotective. She even refused to fly you to the restaurant saying it could hurt the baby.</p><p><br></p><p>You were shaken from your thoughts when a warm hand clasped yours. \u201cHey, are you ok?\u201d She was always so soft with you. Before you had met her all those weeks ago, you had heard people complain about her being arrogant and mean. But in the time\nyou had known her she hadn\u2019t been like that once. Maybe it was because the\nother ones were insecure men that couldn\u2019t handle a woman being stronger than them, but you didn\u2019t care. <br></p><p><br></p><p>You simply enjoyed the moment and smiled softly at the contact. \u201cI\u2019m fine. In fact, I\u2019m\nhappy. Thank you, Carol.\u201d With a light squeeze to your hand she pulled away, leaving you aching for her touch. \u201cMy pleasure. Shall we?\u201d She pointed at the door and raised her eyebrows. Smiling you nodded and moved to get up.</p><p><br></p><p>The cold air hit you face as soon as you stepped out, making you shiver. Before you could say something, you felt a warm arm sneak around your waist. Looking down\nyou realized the woman next to you was glowing, making you chuckle. \u201cYou know,\nthis can be very useful.\u201d Smirking down at you she pulled you even closer. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen the rest of it.\u201d <br></p><p><br></p><p>With a wink she moved her head to look at the sky. You couldn\u2019t help but look at her, your eyes studying every feature of her face. Starting at her eyes down to the sharp jawline, that made your knees buckle. When your eyes landed on her lips you noticed they were moving. When she looked down at you with amused eyes and a smirk you\ncouldn\u2019t stop the red heat rising in your face.</p><p><br></p><p>Stopping her movement Carol stepped in front of you, her hand not leaving its place around your waist, and her other hand coming up to touch the side of your face. Her boldness surprised you once again but all you could focus on were the lips that were so\nclose to your own. Leaning in closer you heard her whisper. \u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d <br></p><p><br></p><p>You couldn\u2019t help but melt at the question. You couldn\u2019t remember a single time your ex ever asked for consent, not that he ever did something without it, but the specific\nquestion was never asked. Without answering you leaned in, capturing the awaiting lips in your own. <br></p><p><br></p><p>With the first touch you could feel tingles all over your body. You moved your hand to her neck and one sunk in her hair, while Carol tightened her grip around your waist with both arms and pulled you flush against her. Your lips moved in unison and when Carol asked for entrance by biting your lower lip, you couldn\u2019t help but moan, opening your mouth. <br></p><p><br></p><p>You didn\u2019t know how long you were standing there but when the kiss broke because of the need for air, you leaned your forehead against hers. Staying in the tight embrace, Carol moved in for another short, soft kiss before she spoke up. \u201cWe\nshould go. I don\u2019t want you getting sick for real this time.\u201d You placed one more kiss on her lips before you agreed and the two of you made your way back\nhome. The entire time, the glowing arm around you didn\u2019t leave its place.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>After the first date things developed fairly quickly, but not in an uncomfortable pace. Soon you both realized how time flies when you had to go to the doctor to get checked out. You had just entered the sixth month and you were showing clearly. In the\ntime between the first date and now, you and Carol had taken big steps with\neach other. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Soft kisses turned into make out sessions and those turned into sex. Sex with Carol was unlike\nanything you had ever felt. From the very beginning she made sure that you felt\nsafe and comfortable but at the same time she was relentless. You were impressed with how soft she was when it came to your pregnancy though. <br></p><p><br></p><p>One night\nwhen you were laying in bed, her arm beneath your neck and a hand on your belly, you were ready to fall asleep when suddenly Carol\u2019s quick movement startled you. Within a second, she had sat up and had both of her hands on your belly. Moving her head between your face and your belly she whispered loudly. \u201cDid you see\nthat? Did you <b>feel </b>that?\u201d Confused\nyou were going to ask her what she meant when it happened again.</p><p><br></p><p> A soft movement in your belly made you realize what she meant. \u201cOh that? That\u2019s been going on for a couple of days now, I think it\u2019s the baby kicking.\u201d You tried to move into a sitting position but Carol\u2019s face made you stop. Her excited smile she had been wearing the moment she moved\nup, was replaced by a hurt frown. You didn\u2019t understand what had happened, so you lifted your hand and put it on hers on your belly. \u201cWhat is it, Carol?\u201d No answer. The only thing that changed was the hands leaving your belly, leaving a cold feeling in the place where they had been before. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Carol moved away from you and got up from the bed. You only watched how she started pacing in front of your bed with her hands on her forehead. \u201cCarol? What is wrong?\u201d Fear rushed\nthrough your body and you could hear your own heartbeat. This was the moment. Carol was going to leave, she finally understood how serious this is and now she changed\nher mind and wants to go. You couldn\u2019t believe it. Tears gathered in your eyes when the realization hit you. <br></p><p><br></p><p>You wanted to get up and yell at her for playing with you for <b>weeks, </b>making you think she was going to be there. But you were too weak. The cold fear made you freeze and stay seated on the bed. When you didn\u2019t\nhear her steps echoing through the room anymore, you looked up. What you saw,\nsurprised you. There she was, the strongest Avenger, with tears rolling down her\nface. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me? I thought we\u2026.. I thought you and I, we \u2026..Why\ndidn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d <br></p><p><br></p><p>Now you were speechless, all this time you had thought she was going to leave anyway,\nso you didn\u2019t include her in the first place. You remembered the fight you had\nwhen you took Natasha with you to the doctor instead of her. You didn\u2019t understand why she was so mad about it, because you didn\u2019t <b>try </b>to understand. Having been so caught up in your own head, you completely disregarded her feelings.</p><p><br></p><p>Before you\ncould even start to stutter an answer, Carol opened her mouth again, breaking your heart. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to be involved, just tell me. I\u2019m a big girl, I can handle it, but don\u2019t you dare play with me. It\u2019s not fair.\u201d You didn\u2019t\nknow what to say. Your head was all over the place, your heart was beating faster when you finally understood, that Carol was all in. She <b>wanted </b>to be involved. She <b>wanted </b>to be there, and you wouldn\u2019t let her.</p><p><br></p><p>Determined you got up from the bed and walked towards the woman you now knew you loved. \u201cCarol, I \u2026\u201d a groan interrupted your words. Pain. You belly was hurting, something was wrong. You placed your hands on your belly and looked up at Carol with wide eyes. <br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cCarol,\nsomething is wrong. It hurts.\u201d As if the last minutes hadn\u2019t happened Carol took a step forward and took your face in her hands. \u201cStay calm, I\u2019m going to get you to the hospital.\u201d Now she was in her element. Staying calm under\npressure was her job and she couldn\u2019t panic now. <br></p><p><br></p><p>She picked\nyou up carefully, wincing when another contraction (at least you assumed it was\none) forced a gasp out of your mouth. \u201cBreathe. We\u2019ll be right there. Just keep breathing.\u201d Only when Carol started glowing, you realized you were in the air. Just a few minutes later you already landed in front of the hospital, with you\nin her arms, Carol made her way inside. Walking up to the nurse, she frantically started talking. \u201cShe\u2019s pregnant, in her second trimester and she\u2019s feeling contractions, I think. It\u2019s too soon. You need to help her.\u201d <br></p><p><br></p><p>The nurse and Carol started arguing but you weren\u2019t listening. The contractions (?)\nstopped but you were tired anyway. You were going to sleep after all before this whole debacle happened. You slowly closed your eyes ready to fall asleep in your girlfriend\u2019s arms when you were rudely awoken. <br></p><p><br></p><p>You opened your eyes when the warmth left your body and you were placed in a hospital bed with Carol by your side. She was nervous, she played with her hands and had a very focused look on her face. She always got that, when she needed to keep her cool. You couldn\u2019t keep your eyes away from her, watching her with adoration visible on your face.</p><p><br></p><p>When the doctor left after he checked you out, a long breath of relief left both of your\nmouths. Diagnose: Braxton hicks contractions. False alarm and no danger whatsoever. You should be happy, and you were, but your thoughts were somewhere else. So were Carol\u2019s, she was still nervous, slightly less now that she knew the baby was safe, but she was thinking about what to say.</p><p><br></p><p>Taking a\ndeep breath Carol broke her silence. \u201cI need you to listen to me now. I love you. I do. It\u2019s crazy, we\u2019ve known each other for less than a year but I can\u2019t help feeling what I feel.\u201d Your heart started pounding, speechless you were laying there not able to make a sound. <br></p><p><br></p><p>You didn\u2019t need to, the Hero wasn\u2019t done yet. With a soft smile on her face she laid her\nhands on top of your belly and continued with a soft voice. <br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI also\nlove this baby. I want to be a part of this. I knew what I was getting into when I went on that date with you. And I wouldn\u2019t change it for the world. I want to be there for this child, raising it. With you. But if you don\u2019t want that then you have to tell me because if you tell me when this kid is older\u2026. I don\u2019t think I can handle it. It would mean losing the child and losing you. I can\u2019t do that, y/n. So, tell me what you want. You decide.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>You didn\u2019t notice\nthe tears rolling down your face until a sob wrecked through your body. The things\nyou felt were so intense, you didn\u2019t even know you could feel so much at once. Love. Relief. Joy. Happiness. More love. Now you just had to put it into words, and that was harder than you thought.</p><p><br></p><p>Carol was waiting patiently, sitting in front of you with her hands clasped. She wanted to dry your tears and make you stop crying but she wasn\u2019t sure if that would be welcomed anymore. You sat up slowly and moved your legs over the bed, patting\nthe bed next to you. Carol moved carefully around you and sat down, careful not to touch you, however hard it was for her. <br></p><p><br></p><p>With a light chuckle you took her hands and as soon as your eyes locked you knew what you had to say. Everything that was in your head came pouring out.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI was scared you\u2019d leave. I didn\u2019t even realize I had excluded you from the whole thing\nuntil you were pacing in front of the bed. Of course, I want you to be a part of this. You are the softest, most patient and loving person I\u2019ve ever met. This baby will be lucky to have you raise it. Cause that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to\ndo. Raise it. Together.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Carol couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore. She grabbed your face and crashed your lips together, tasting both of you tears, while you moved with each other. Breaking the kiss and leaning your foreheads against each other you whispered softly \u201c I love you, too.\u201d <br></p><p><br></p><p>The smile that broke out on both of your faces made the following kisses a little awkward, but neither of you cared. You had a future; you were on the same page.\nYou were going to be parents.</p>",

And he said he wasn\u2019t going to be a part of it, so I left.\u201d Sitting on the couch in the common room of the Avenger compound, you held your head in your hands fighting tears. Your best friend, Natasha Romanoff, was sitting next to you listening patiently. She had one hand on your back, slowly moving it up and down. \u201cListen, you can do it. Don\u2019t worry about him, he\u2019s an asshole anyway.\u201d Chuckling\nyou looked up at your friend when another wave of tears hit you. Natasha frowned slightly and moved both her arms around your shaking body.</p><p><br></p><p>The two of you met years ago, when you were recruited by Fury. Natasha was responsible for your training and even though the training was excruciating, you two became very close friends over the years. When your training was finished, you became Maria Hill\u2019s right hand and therefore worked really close with Fury himself. Every\nonce on a while you would be assigned to the team but normally, you would work\nwith \u201cnormal\u201d agents.</p><p><br></p><p>That was until a couple of months ago. Captain America himself walked into your office asking for you to work with the Avengers. At first, you declined, knowing it would\nmean a lot more work but when you talked to Nat and Clint about it, you couldn\u2019t stop yourself from agreeing. Much to the dismay of your then boyfriend. You had been together forever and everybody was sure the two of you would end up\ntogether. But he changed when you took the job with the Avengers, blaming you for\nthe downfall of the relationship and accusing you of prioritizing your job. But you stayed together anyway, the thought of breaking up not entering either of your minds.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Until a day ago. You found out you were pregnant and even though you had mixed feeling about it, you thought with the support you would get from your boyfriend and the\nteam, who had become like a family to you, everything would work out.</p><p><br></p><p>But when you told him, all hell broke loose. He yelled at you. Screaming you wouldn\u2019t be a good mother and that the child wouldn\u2019t love you because you would be gone all\nthe time anyway. When he grabbed you and tried to convince you to have an abortion,\nyou couldn\u2019t stop yourself. <br></p><p><br></p><p>You were a trained agent, but your calm and patient character kept you from freaking out\nin situations where other people would throw knives (other people meaning Natasha Romanoff). But this time you had enough, you pulled your arms out of his grip and hit him right in the face. Telling him it was over and that you\u2019d pick up your stuff when he wasn\u2019t home. <br></p><p><br></p><p>That\u2019s how you ended up at the Avengers compound, knocking on Nat\u2019s door and spending the night in her room. In the morning, after breakfast, you sat on the couch and explained what happened. Natasha almost jumped up, ready to throw a knife at that asshole when she heard how he reacted. She calmed down very fast though when tears of\ndisappointment started rolling down your face. <br></p><p><br></p><p>So, now you\nwere sitting on the couch, leaning into Natasha, who was trying to calm down. All of a sudden, the newest member of the team, Carol Danvers, came waltzing in. \u201cHey Widow, you ready for me to kick your ass?\u201d The confident smile left her face when she studied the scene in front of her. You quickly moved away from your friend and dropped you head, not wanting her to see the state you were in.</p><p><br></p><p>You didn\u2019t have the chance to really get to know Carol so far. You were both busy and quite\nfrankly didn\u2019t really have an interest in getting to know each other. You knew, you eventually had to approach the Captain but you had other problems at the time. That\u2019s why now it seemed awkward for Carol to ask if everything was alright, so instead she just stood there, stiff as a broom stick, staring at the two other\nwomen. <br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right  there Carol. I just have to\u2026\u201d \u201cNo, you should go.\u201d You didn\u2019t let the redhead finish that sentence. You knew that Nat didn\u2019t want to leave you alone, but if you were being honest the sadness you were feeling just a second go, was turning into anger and a workout didn\u2019t sound so bad. \u201cYou know what?\u201d you started while getting up from the couch and walking towards the blonde. \u201cI could use a workout. And you and I don\u2019t know each other well, so let\u2019s do a getting-to-know-each-other spar.\u201d With a confident smile you waited for an answer from the other women, instead Nat spoke up. <br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cY/n, are you sure you should be working out?\u201d she asked quietly with a pointed look towards your belly. You weren\u2019t showing yet and for that you were happy because you weren\u2019t ready for people to find out about the baby quite yet. So quickly you held her hand up to stop her from continuing. \u201cYes, why wouldn\u2019t I? It\u2019s just a\nlittle work out. It won\u2019t kill me.\u201d Turning your head back to Carol, who had been standing there without saying a word, you raised your eyebrows challenging her. \u201cOr is the mighty space cowboy scared?\u201d <br></p><p><br></p><p>That immediately caused a reaction, Carol straightened her back, always ready for a challenge. With a confident smirk on her face she answered. \u201cOh, I\u2019m not scared. But you should be. You don\u2019t know me, and I could kick your ass even without my powers.\u201d Raising\nyour eyebrows again, you hummed and took another step towards the hero. \u201cAlright then, mighty hero. We have special wristbands here that block most of your powers. How about you put one of those on and we make it a fair fight.\u201d <br></p><p><br></p><p>Slightly taken aback, not knowing of such technology, Carol hesitated a second too long for you not to notice, causing your smirk to deepen. But she quickly shook her head and locked eyes with her opponent. \u201cBring it, Agent y/l/n.\u201d Excited about having a way to get rid of your energy, you walked past Carol making your way to the lab to get the wristband, leaving a stunned Carol and a concerned Natasha in the room. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be too hard on her. You could cause serious damage.\u201d <br></p><p><br></p><p>Turning around facing the redhead, a frown formed on Carol\u2019s face. \u201cWhat do you mean? I thought she could handle herself.\u201d With a chuckle the former spy took a step towards the other woman. With a quiet voice she hoped no one could hear her. \u201cOh, she can handle herself just fine. I trained her after all. But things are a little\u2026.tense at the moment. So, just don\u2019t hit too hard ok.\u201d <br></p><p><br></p><p>Seeing the serious expression on Natasha\u2019s face, Carol\u2019s face softened and she nodded her head. She may not know exactly what\u2019s going on but judging on what she walked\nin to, it must be something serious. \u201cYeah. Alright. I\u2019ll watch out.\u201d With a thankful smile Natasha pointed at the door. \u201cWell, then. Let\u2019s go, I\u2019m sure y/n is already waiting.\u201d <br></p><p><br></p><p>Making their way to the training room, the were met with a sight Carol would always remember as the first moment she felt something stir in her guts. There you\nwere, in the tightest workout clothes that existed and a huge smile on your face. Snapping herself out of the stupor, Carol caught up to the redhead, who was already half way across the room. <br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAlright new friend. Put this thing on and let\u2019s get started.\u201d With a suggestive smile you moved the wristband in front of Carol\u2019s face. You felt giddy and excited, almost forgetting about everything with your ex. Even though you didn\u2019t know it yet, it was clear that distracting you from problems would be one of Carol\u2019s specialties. <br></p><p><br></p><p>With a sigh Carol took the wristband and snapped it around her wrist, immediately feeling some kind of numbness. The power she felt lingering under her skin at all times was gone and she wasn\u2019t sure how she felt about it. With a sympathetic pad to Carol\u2019s shoulder, Natasha started talking. \u201cHere are some ground rules.\u201d <br></p><p><br></p><p>You interrupted her with a loud groan and an eyeroll. \u201cWe\u2019re adults, we don\u2019t need\nground rules.\u201d Rolling her eyes Natasha snapped at her \u201cYes, we do. So shut up and listen. Number one: no serious injuries, you tap out if it\u2019s too much. Number two: when I say stop, you both stop. Immediately. And lastly number three: Don\u2019t you dare lose, y/n. I trained you and you have to make me proud.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>With a confident smile you made your way towards the sparring matt. \u201cPlease, Nat. Have\nsome faith.\u201d Shaking her head Carol made her way towards you. The feeling of excitement rushing through your body, ready to kick some ass. The Captain doesn\u2019t like fighting without her powers, it reminded her too much of Yon-rogg and how he would always scold her, but for some reason when she looked at you and how\nyou jumped up and down to warm up a little bit, she couldn\u2019t help but look forward to doing this. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Already in her workout clothes, Carol got ready, standing opposite of you. Natasha was the referee and therefore the one to start the \u201cfight\u201d. \u201cReady,\u2026fight\u201d You started circling each other. You had never fought each other before, so you both had to figure out the other one first. Plus, Carol had to get used to her human strength, which proved to be a little more difficult than she\u2019d expected.</p><p><br></p><p>After more than a minute, you took a step forward swinging at Carol. She blocked the hit and that\u2019s when the fight got intense. Both of you throwing punches but never landing, yet Carol got closer to beating you than the other way around. It continued like that for a while, until something made Carol lose her focus. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Your shirt started riding up from all the movement and only for a split second, Carol\u2019s eyes left\nyours and instead travelled towards the revealed skin. Barely a second being enough, you landed a hard punch to the other one\u2019s face making her stumble. Followed by a kick to her chest, Carol landed with her back on the mat. Sensing your win, you threw yourself on top of the on the ground laying woman and prevented her from getting up. Without her super strength Carol didn\u2019t stand a chance and reluctantly\ntapped out.</p><p><br></p><p>With an incredibly wide smile, you jumped off Carol and threw your arms in the air. \u201cYes! I won.\u201d You\nexclaimed loudly. Normally Carol would be pissed, she hated losing but for some\nreason all she could do was smile at your excitement. Priding herself in making\nyou laugh after seeing you cry onto Natasha\u2019s shoulder- Carol walked up to you with her hand held out for a congratulatory handshake. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Instead of taking it, you automatically moved your arms around the blonde woman, embracing her tightly, surprising not just the hero but yourself. \u201cThank you.\u201d The soft whisper hit Carol\u2019s ear causing goosebumps to break out all over her body. Taken aback she just put her arms around your waist and squeezed gently. <br></p><p><br></p><p>From the corner of the room Natasha just watched the interaction. On the one hand she felt immense proud, but she was also curious about Carol\u2019s reaction. Of course, the spy saw the movement of her eyes and she couldn\u2019t help but wonder what had gotten into the Captain. She had known Carol longer and better than you, but she hadn\u2019t seen her acting like that. Ever. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Before Natasha could finish her line of thought you spoke up, while leaving the embrace with a slight blush on your cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m going to head out now. I have to take care of some stuff but thanks for the workout.\u201d Before Natasha could say anything, you ehad already left the room with a wave towards the other women. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Startling Carol while she was taking off her wristband, Natasha eyed her suspiciously. \u201cHow\ncome you lost? You dominated her most of the time.\u201d Shrugging but not making eye\ncontact the answer was a short one. \u201cYou wanted me to go easy on her, so I did.\u201d <br></p><p><br></p><p>Before Natasha could say anything in return, that may have caused a conversation Carol didn\u2019t want to have right now, she quickly spoke up again. \u201cWell now that I got my ass kicked, I need to kick someone else\u2019s. Ready to do what we originally\ncame here for.\u201d Moving towards the new Avenger, Natasha forgot what she wanted\nto say and started smirking. \u201cHell yeah. Let\u2019s get this started.\u201d <br></p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>After the sparring session, you and Carol got a closer. You had picked up most of your stuff from your old apartment and Tony offered you a room on the compound. You felt like you were officially a part of the team. Living at the same place as Carol\nseemed to make the getting to know each other a lot easier. You easily fell into a routine. You\u2019d work out together every other morning, sparring or just doing some weightlifting, of course you took it a little slower but without being suspicious. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Natasha was still the only one who knew about you being pregnant and for the time being that was exactly what you wanted. You weren\u2019t ready to tell anybody, simply because you hadn\u2019t dealt with it yourself. Every once in a while, Natasha would join you other two in the morning but mostly it was just Carol and yourself. <br></p><p><br></p><p>One day, approximately two weeks after the first time you sparred together, you didn\u2019t show up in the training room. It worried Carol, you were very punctual, in the time you had been training together, there wasn\u2019t on time you came in later than five minutes earlier. When you didn\u2019t show up after fifteen minutes, Carol made her way towards your room, which was on the other side of where Carol had hers. <br></p><p><br></p><p>She would be lying if she said she wasn\u2019t worried. For some reason you had completely broken down her walls within such a small amount of time. You talked often after your workouts, with Carol sharing things she normally didn\u2019t tell anyone, not even Fury. <br></p><p><br></p><p>She explained how she got her powers and how she was \u2018abducted\u2019 by the Kree. How lonely and confused she was when she couldn\u2019t remember her past. She talked about her shock, when she read the file about her and Mar-vell\u2019s plans. She went into detail with it all, even the bad stuff she did for the Kree, but you didn\u2019t judge her. Not once. Carol felt safe around you, like she could just be herself and in return she felt like you opened up, too. And you did.</p><p><br></p><p>You explained how you were recruited and how terrible your training was with Natasha. But it still was the best time you have had; Carol could tell that the bond you two had was very deep and important to both of you. <br></p><p><br></p><p>One day Carol talked to Natasha about you and she found out that you were pretty much the only one everybody opened up, too. Whether that was Tony about his nightmares about the battle of New York or how he struggled with forgiving Bucky for killing his parents, or Steve talking about his lost life and his ache about what he could\u2019ve had with Peggy. No matter who it was, they all came to you because you made everyone feel the same way Carol felt. Accepted, listened to and most importantly not judged.</p><p><br></p><p>While the blonde made her way to your room, she couldn\u2019t help but think about how amazing she thinks you are and how important you have become to her. An involuntary smile etched its way onto her face, while her heart sped up with the thought. As soon as she arrived at her destination though, that smile dropped immediately when she heard weird sounds coming from the inside of the room.</p><p><br></p><p>Quickly she opened the door, when she saw no one in the main part of the room her head snapped to the bathroom when she heard you. Walking towards the sound she sighed in relive when she saw you sitting on the ground. But the feeling quickly changed when she realized what was going on. <br></p><p><br></p><p>You were leaning over the toilet with your hair pulled back. You didn\u2019t react when Carol entered the room, because you hadn\u2019t even realized someone was there. Only when cold hands made their way onto your forehead and back did you look up into beautiful but concerned, brown eyes. \u201cCarol? What are you doing here?\u201d With a soft voice, that could only be heard because you were so close to each other, the blonde woman answered while continuing to rub your back soothingly.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou were late, and normally you\u2019re not. I was worried and it seems like I had every right to be.\u201d Before you could formulate an answer, your eyes got big when you felt your stomach grumble. Fast you turned your head back over the toilet, ready to have all remnants of food leave your body. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Silence settled over the two of you, only interrupted by painful souding dry heaving coming from you. When you were sure there was nothing left, that could leave your body, you leaned back against Carol. The warmth coming from her calming you down tremendously. For a moment Carol relished the moment of closeness, realizing how comfortable she felt with your body against hers.</p><p><br></p><p>She was still worried though and didn\u2019t want you to get cold, so she gently moved some strands of hair out of your pale face and whispered \u201cY/n, hey. Come on you should go to bed and rest.\u201d Huffing, you opened your eyes and sat up, immediately missing the contact. \u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. I just don\u2019t think I can spar with you today.\u201d You didn\u2019t want to have to explain why you didn\u2019t have a fever, so just acting like nothing had happened seemed like a better option.</p><p><br></p><p>Slowly you started getting up, feeling better already. Seems like pregnant-vomiting doesn\u2019t make you feel as bad as flue-vomiting. Carol on the other hand was still worried, not wanting you to overwhelm yourself, she grabbed your elbow steadying you. \u201cWhoa, whoa. Come on y/n, you\u2019re sick and you need to rest. Not everyone can be immune to everything like I am.\u201d With a smile Carol got you to laugh out loud.</p><p><br></p><p>In your time together you quickly realized, that was one of the Captains talents. You hadn\u2019t laughed that much in a very long time, at least not with an almost stranger. And Carol took every chance she had to see you smile or hear your laugh. It made her heart jump in excitement, feeling like an addict every time she succeeded. <br></p><p><br></p><p>You felt the same way, amazed with the fact that Carol could distract you from all of your worries and problems almost as soon as she entered the room. But you were apprehensive, not wanting to act on any of those feelings bubbling under the surface.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Carol.\u201d You snapped at the other woman, instead of thanking her, when she tried to push you towards the bed. Not expecting such a reaction coming from you, since she had never seen you angry or genuinely annoyed, Caro pulled her hands away as if she had been burnt. You hadn\u2019t told anybody about your pregnancy yet, obviously. So far, Natasha was still the only one who knew, and it was important to you that it stayed that way. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Every once in a while, though, you felt like telling Carol everything and be as open with\nher as the Captain was with you, but something kept you from doing so. Maybe your growing feelings for the woman had something to do with it, but again, you wouldn\u2019t even acknowledge them. Who the hell would want to start a relationship with a pregnant woman? <br></p><p><br></p><p>But now, standing in you room and looking at Carol, who had a hurt look on her face, you started feeling guilty. Nonetheless you couldn\u2019t bring your mouth to say the words and come clean, scared of the reaction. \u201cAlright, whatever you say.\u201d Turning away from you, Carol made her way towards the door wanting to get out of here. She\nwas surprised by her own feelings, not understanding why she was so hurt by you\nsnapping at her.</p><p><br></p><p>As the\nguilt spread through your body you wanted to stop the other woman from leaving. You had felt safe leaning against her with Carol\u2019s soft touches against your face, but your body wouldn\u2019t move from the spot two feet away from the bed. You were simply too scared by the outcome of everything. You also had no idea how you would handle the whole baby situation, even though Natasha constantly tried to talk to you about it, you hadn\u2019t even met with a doctor yet. You were completely overwhelmed with everything.</p><p><br></p><p>You felt\ntears welling up in your eyes when you sat down on your bed, feeling hopeless and absolutely defeated. You were exhausted from all the thinking and the throwing up, so you laid down, curled up into a ball and fell asleep.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>It had been a couple of days since the incident in your room and you hadn\u2019t talked to each other ever since. So, when you walked into the kitchen one morning, you weren\u2019t prepared to see Carol and Nat sitting on the table having breakfast together. Before you could turn around though, you locked eyes with Carol. Neither could look away, both realizing how much you had missed the other even though it had only been a couple of days. With a deep breath you walked over to the woman who had been on you mind constantly and spoke softly. \u201cHey Carol, uhm could we talk for a second?\u201d <br></p><p>Sensing the serious tone and knowing what had happened between you two, Natasha cleared her throat. \u201cI have something to do anyway.\u201d With a soft smile to both women and an encouraging squeeze to your hand, the spy made her way out of the kitchen. As soon as she was out of earshot you started rambling. You couldn\u2019t stop the words from literally falling out of your mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m really sorry Carol. I shouldn\u2019t have snapped at you; I know you only wanted to help. I just have a lot on my mind but that\u2019s no excuse. I shouldn\u2019t treat you that way, you deserve better than that. I mean, I know I\u2019ve only known you like three weeks, but I like you. I do. And I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Wide eyed, you stopped yourself from speaking and looked up. When you saw Carol smiling softly, all you could do was exhale loudly, knowing you were forgiven. \u201cI understand. It\u2019s okay just don\u2019t do that again or I\u2019ll kick your ass. This time <b>with</b> my powers.\u201d After a short break, Carol\u2019s smile was replaced with a frown. You felt her heart speed up when Carol got up from her chair and slowly reached out to take your hands, making sure you had every chance to pull away if you wanted to.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou know, you can talk to me about the things that are on your mind. It may not seem like it sometimes, but I can be a good listener.\u201d A soft chuckle escaped her mouth while she continued rubbing her thumbs over the back of your hands, leaving a tingling sensation behind. It was a tender moment between you two, causing you\nboth to release shaky breaths. You dropped your gaze, fixating on your joint hands. You felt safe, like Carol was going to protect you, and for a split second you allowed your feelings to come rushing to the surface. You were shocked when you realized how hard your heart was pounding, you were sure Carol could hear or maybe even feel it through your hands.</p><p><br></p><p>But that moment went away quickly, when your mind went back to what was going through your head in the first place. It\u2019s like you were stuck. You wanted to tell Carol everything but you just <b>couldn\u2019t. </b>It was too much, so instead you settled for an answer you hoped would keep Carol from asking again. \u201cI\u2019m sure of that. I just can\u2019t talk about it just yet. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d With an apologetic look, you squeezed Carol\u2019s hands. Nodding slowly, slightly disappointed by the answer, Carol let go of your hands.</p><p><br></p><p>You felt cold suddenly. Like the warmth left your body when your hands stopped touching. So, you quickly grabbed the retreating hands and took a small step forward. \u201cHow about we go back to our routine? Just minus the sparring, I think I need a break from that. But we could still have lunch and you know hang out or work some files together.\u201d <i>As long as I can spend time with you.</i> The last part was left unsaid, as much as you wanted to voice that thought, you couldn\u2019t.</p><p><br></p><p>With a smirk on her face Carol pulled you a little closer, surprising you with her boldness.\n\u201cCan\u2019t get enough of me, huh?\u201d \u00a0Her smirk\nturned into a smile when she heard that full laugh she learned to love. Locking eyes, you realized how close you were, but instead of feeling awkward or scared, both of you savored that moment. <br></p><p><br></p><p>After your talk, things returned to their normal routine. Well, instead of working out together\nyou had lunch every day. You helped Carol understanding the new earth technology and most nights were spent watching movies together. Whenever Carol had a mission, you would welcome her back with food and a chill night, so the hero could relax. It felt nice, domestic even.</p><p><br></p><p>Months went by like this, and during that time your relationship shifted. It intensified and so did your feelings for each other. It became harder and harder for you to hide them. Added to your inner turmoil, the pregnancy progressed as well. After\na long talk with Natasha, you finally decided to go to a doctor. You checked everything out and felt a weight lift of your shoulders when all the results were positive ones. You hadn\u2019t heard from your ex in weeks. All in all, you felt happy and Carol, of course, had a major part in it.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>\u201cAlright how about Chicken? Or we could just order some pizza, maybe some French food. No wait, I don\u2019t like that\u201d You walked into the kitchen, Carol following closely. She had an amused smirk on her face listening to you counting all the food options that existed. Halting in the kitchen you turned around with wide\neyes \u201cOh my god, Hot Dogs!\u201d you could eat tons of food at the moment. You craved everything, not so much disgusting things like they always show in movies, but just food in general. So, when Carol told you her mission was cancelled\nyour head immediately went to dinner.</p><p><br></p><p>With a chuckle Carol put her hands on your shoulders holding you still. \u201cHow about we make it official, huh? I\u2019ll take you to a nice restaurant, you can eat everything you want, and I\u2019ll pay.\u201d Just like that the smile dropped from your face. <br></p><p><br></p><p>When the realization of being asked out by the woman you most definitely had some feelings for, hit you, your head went blank. Your lack of answer caused Carol to pull back disappointed. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want that, that\u2019s ok. I just thought, you know, in the past week we\u2026..\u201d you had never seen her like this. She was embarrassed but also sad and for some reason you couldn\u2019t live with the fact that you caused\nher to feel that way.</p><p><br></p><p>Your mouth acted on its own, it had gotten you in trouble before and now there was no difference. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d Silence. Carol\u2019s face went through a hundred emotions within a second and lastly it settled on a confused frown. Closing and opening her mouth she tried to find anything to say but came up with nothing. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Knowing there was no going back now, you realized you had to explain it to her. \u201cRemember the day you walked in on Nat and me? When I was crying?\u201d Carol just nodded, no words escaping her mouth. With a sigh you gently guided her towards the couch. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we sit down.\u201d Slowly you both made your way towards the couch, with you sitting down further away from her than the two of you had gotten used to.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWell, I found out I was pregnant, told my boyfriend and he freaked out, so I broke up with him and came here. Nat took care of me, she\u2019s good at that. When you and I got closer, I wanted to tell you, believe me. But I was scared how you would\nreact. Now, though, I\u2019m starting to show slowly, and I don\u2019t think I could\u2019ve kept it from you any longer.\u201d <br></p><p><br></p><p>Letting out a long breath you looked at the woman facing you. Her eyes locked onto your belly that was a little rounder than it used to be. Still not responding you continued. You had spilled so much already, may as well go all the way. \u201cI like you, Carol. A lot actually, but I\u2019m pregnant and that\u2019s not going to change. I just don\u2019t want you to do something you or even I could regret in the future.\u201d <br></p><p><br></p><p>And that was it. Everything was out in the open and how things would go from here, was solely up to the woman trying to comprehend everything. After minutes of silence you felt yourself tearing up. This was exactly what you feared. Now the only person, you actually liked would walk away from you and you would be alone. Leaning back on\nto the couch you used your hands to cover your face. You couldn\u2019t watch her walk away; it would be too much.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSo, no sushi then.\u201d Hearing her voice so loud and clear you moved your hands and snapped your head in Carol\u2019s direction. Looking at her face you were the one that was confused now. She showed no sign of shock or anything like that. A\nsoft smile grazed her lips as her eyes locked with yours.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cW-what?\u201d your brain refused to comprehend what was happening. Your heart started fluttering in your chest but you weren\u2019t sure if it was because you were happy or because of your nerves. You couldn\u2019t move, even when Carol scooched closer to you and took your hands in hers. <br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cListen y/n. Am I surprised about all of this? God, yes. But I don\u2019t care. I like you and you\u2019re important to me so I would like to take you out. We just can\u2019t have\nsushi because pregnant people aren\u2019t aloud to eat that.\u201d Her eyes twinkled in humor. She waited patiently for you to understand that she wouldn\u2019t walk away and simply continued holding on to your hands. <br></p><p><br></p><p>When you were finally convinced Carol wasn\u2019t joking, the tears in your eyes started falling down. Worried, Carol moved one of her hands to your face and wiped them away. \u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong? Don\u2019t cry, please.\u201d She came even closer and wrapped you in a warm hug. You felt just like the time you had leaned against her on your bathroom floor. Safe. Protected.</p><p><br></p><p>Not wanting to keep her waiting for an answer, you took a deep breath and pulled away from her, but just enough so you could look her in the eyes. Your hand found her leg that was perched on the couch and you slowly started smiling. <br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cCongratulations Ms. Danvers, you got yourself a date with a pregnant lady.\u201d Laughing, Carol leaned forward almost touching your lips, making your heart pound like crazy. Before your\nlips touched you could feel her whisper against them instead. \u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure.\u201d With a smirk she pulled away and got up in one swift motion, leaving you on the couch with surprised look on your face.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWell, get ready. We\u2019re leaving in thirty minutes.\u201d Carol quickly made her way out of the room leaving you on the couch. You couldn\u2019t stop the smile from forming on your face. After several weeks of hiding your feelings and ignoring them you could finally\nlet go. You squealed in excitement and threw yourself on the couch. </p><p>Laying there\nyou touched the soft curve of your belly and did something you hadn\u2019t done before.\n\u201cHey little human. Your mommy has a date.\u201d Smiling you slowly moved up to get\nready for dinner. It seemed like a weight was lifted from your chest. You weren\u2019t worried about your ex; you weren\u2019t worried about Carol leaving but most importantly you weren\u2019t worried about the baby that was growing inside of you. For\nthe first time in a while, you felt completely at ease, ready for the future.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s how he lost his eye. It was Goose.\u201d Shocked, you leaned back in your chair, mouth agape not believing what Carol just told you. Fury lost his eye because of a cat. Well, a Flerken but still. \u201cWow, Fury is one dramatic son of a bitch.\u201d The blonde woman sitting opposite from you broke out into laughter and you couldn\u2019t\nhelp but join.</p><p><br></p><p>It had been\nan amazing evening; Carol had taken you to a little restaurant not far from the\ncompound. You had talked all night like you always did but this time it felt different,\nmore intimate. You had finally told her the rest of the story about your boyfriend, sharing your thoughts as well as the fear you had because of the baby. <br></p><p><br></p><p>The superhero surprised you by how head on she was facing the whole situation. At first you thought Carol would just ignore the fact that you were pregnant and act like this was a normal date, but you quickly realized that was not the\ncase. Carol was concerned and even a little overprotective. She even refused to fly you to the restaurant saying it could hurt the baby.</p><p><br></p><p>You were shaken from your thoughts when a warm hand clasped yours. \u201cHey, are you ok?\u201d She was always so soft with you. Before you had met her all those weeks ago, you had heard people complain about her being arrogant and mean. But in the time\nyou had known her she hadn\u2019t been like that once. Maybe it was because the\nother ones were insecure men that couldn\u2019t handle a woman being stronger than them, but you didn\u2019t care. <br></p><p><br></p><p>You simply enjoyed the moment and smiled softly at the contact. \u201cI\u2019m fine. In fact, I\u2019m\nhappy. Thank you, Carol.\u201d With a light squeeze to your hand she pulled away, leaving you aching for her touch. \u201cMy pleasure. Shall we?\u201d She pointed at the door and raised her eyebrows. Smiling you nodded and moved to get up.</p><p><br></p><p>The cold air hit you face as soon as you stepped out, making you shiver. Before you could say something, you felt a warm arm sneak around your waist. Looking down\nyou realized the woman next to you was glowing, making you chuckle. \u201cYou know,\nthis can be very useful.\u201d Smirking down at you she pulled you even closer. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen the rest of it.\u201d <br></p><p><br></p><p>With a wink she moved her head to look at the sky. You couldn\u2019t help but look at her, your eyes studying every feature of her face. Starting at her eyes down to the sharp jawline, that made your knees buckle. When your eyes landed on her lips you noticed they were moving. When she looked down at you with amused eyes and a smirk you\ncouldn\u2019t stop the red heat rising in your face.</p><p><br></p><p>Stopping her movement Carol stepped in front of you, her hand not leaving its place around your waist, and her other hand coming up to touch the side of your face. Her boldness surprised you once again but all you could focus on were the lips that were so\nclose to your own. Leaning in closer you heard her whisper. \u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d <br></p><p><br></p><p>You couldn\u2019t help but melt at the question. You couldn\u2019t remember a single time your ex ever asked for consent, not that he ever did something without it, but the specific\nquestion was never asked. Without answering you leaned in, capturing the awaiting lips in your own. <br></p><p><br></p><p>With the first touch you could feel tingles all over your body. You moved your hand to her neck and one sunk in her hair, while Carol tightened her grip around your waist with both arms and pulled you flush against her. Your lips moved in unison and when Carol asked for entrance by biting your lower lip, you couldn\u2019t help but moan, opening your mouth. <br></p><p><br></p><p>You didn\u2019t know how long you were standing there but when the kiss broke because of the need for air, you leaned your forehead against hers. Staying in the tight embrace, Carol moved in for another short, soft kiss before she spoke up. \u201cWe\nshould go. I don\u2019t want you getting sick for real this time.\u201d You placed one more kiss on her lips before you agreed and the two of you made your way back\nhome. The entire time, the glowing arm around you didn\u2019t leave its place.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>After the first date things developed fairly quickly, but not in an uncomfortable pace. Soon you both realized how time flies when you had to go to the doctor to get checked out. You had just entered the sixth month and you were showing clearly. In the\ntime between the first date and now, you and Carol had taken big steps with\neach other. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Soft kisses turned into make out sessions and those turned into sex. Sex with Carol was unlike\nanything you had ever felt. From the very beginning she made sure that you felt\nsafe and comfortable but at the same time she was relentless. You were impressed with how soft she was when it came to your pregnancy though. <br></p><p><br></p><p>One night\nwhen you were laying in bed, her arm beneath your neck and a hand on your belly, you were ready to fall asleep when suddenly Carol\u2019s quick movement startled you. Within a second, she had sat up and had both of her hands on your belly. Moving her head between your face and your belly she whispered loudly. \u201cDid you see\nthat? Did you <b>feel </b>that?\u201d Confused\nyou were going to ask her what she meant when it happened again.</p><p><br></p><p> A soft movement in your belly made you realize what she meant. \u201cOh that? That\u2019s been going on for a couple of days now, I think it\u2019s the baby kicking.\u201d You tried to move into a sitting position but Carol\u2019s face made you stop. Her excited smile she had been wearing the moment she moved\nup, was replaced by a hurt frown. You didn\u2019t understand what had happened, so you lifted your hand and put it on hers on your belly. \u201cWhat is it, Carol?\u201d No answer. The only thing that changed was the hands leaving your belly, leaving a cold feeling in the place where they had been before. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Carol moved away from you and got up from the bed. You only watched how she started pacing in front of your bed with her hands on her forehead. \u201cCarol? What is wrong?\u201d Fear rushed\nthrough your body and you could hear your own heartbeat. This was the moment. Carol was going to leave, she finally understood how serious this is and now she changed\nher mind and wants to go. You couldn\u2019t believe it. Tears gathered in your eyes when the realization hit you. <br></p><p><br></p><p>You wanted to get up and yell at her for playing with you for <b>weeks, </b>making you think she was going to be there. But you were too weak. The cold fear made you freeze and stay seated on the bed. When you didn\u2019t\nhear her steps echoing through the room anymore, you looked up. What you saw,\nsurprised you. There she was, the strongest Avenger, with tears rolling down her\nface. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me? I thought we\u2026.. I thought you and I, we \u2026..Why\ndidn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d <br></p><p><br></p><p>Now you were speechless, all this time you had thought she was going to leave anyway,\nso you didn\u2019t include her in the first place. You remembered the fight you had\nwhen you took Natasha with you to the doctor instead of her. You didn\u2019t understand why she was so mad about it, because you didn\u2019t <b>try </b>to understand. Having been so caught up in your own head, you completely disregarded her feelings.</p><p><br></p><p>Before you\ncould even start to stutter an answer, Carol opened her mouth again, breaking your heart. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to be involved, just tell me. I\u2019m a big girl, I can handle it, but don\u2019t you dare play with me. It\u2019s not fair.\u201d You didn\u2019t\nknow what to say. Your head was all over the place, your heart was beating faster when you finally understood, that Carol was all in. She <b>wanted </b>to be involved. She <b>wanted </b>to be there, and you wouldn\u2019t let her.</p><p><br></p><p>Determined you got up from the bed and walked towards the woman you now knew you loved. \u201cCarol, I \u2026\u201d a groan interrupted your words. Pain. You belly was hurting, something was wrong. You placed your hands on your belly and looked up at Carol with wide eyes. <br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cCarol,\nsomething is wrong. It hurts.\u201d As if the last minutes hadn\u2019t happened Carol took a step forward and took your face in her hands. \u201cStay calm, I\u2019m going to get you to the hospital.\u201d Now she was in her element. Staying calm under\npressure was her job and she couldn\u2019t panic now. <br></p><p><br></p><p>She picked\nyou up carefully, wincing when another contraction (at least you assumed it was\none) forced a gasp out of your mouth. \u201cBreathe. We\u2019ll be right there. Just keep breathing.\u201d Only when Carol started glowing, you realized you were in the air. Just a few minutes later you already landed in front of the hospital, with you\nin her arms, Carol made her way inside. Walking up to the nurse, she frantically started talking. \u201cShe\u2019s pregnant, in her second trimester and she\u2019s feeling contractions, I think. It\u2019s too soon. You need to help her.\u201d <br></p><p><br></p><p>The nurse and Carol started arguing but you weren\u2019t listening. The contractions (?)\nstopped but you were tired anyway. You were going to sleep after all before this whole debacle happened. You slowly closed your eyes ready to fall asleep in your girlfriend\u2019s arms when you were rudely awoken. <br></p><p><br></p><p>You opened your eyes when the warmth left your body and you were placed in a hospital bed with Carol by your side. She was nervous, she played with her hands and had a very focused look on her face. She always got that, when she needed to keep her cool. You couldn\u2019t keep your eyes away from her, watching her with adoration visible on your face.</p><p><br></p><p>When the doctor left after he checked you out, a long breath of relief left both of your\nmouths. Diagnose: Braxton hicks contractions. False alarm and no danger whatsoever. You should be happy, and you were, but your thoughts were somewhere else. So were Carol\u2019s, she was still nervous, slightly less now that she knew the baby was safe, but she was thinking about what to say.</p><p><br></p><p>Taking a\ndeep breath Carol broke her silence. \u201cI need you to listen to me now. I love you. I do. It\u2019s crazy, we\u2019ve known each other for less than a year but I can\u2019t help feeling what I feel.\u201d Your heart started pounding, speechless you were laying there not able to make a sound. <br></p><p><br></p><p>You didn\u2019t need to, the Hero wasn\u2019t done yet. With a soft smile on her face she laid her\nhands on top of your belly and continued with a soft voice. <br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI also\nlove this baby. I want to be a part of this. I knew what I was getting into when I went on that date with you. And I wouldn\u2019t change it for the world. I want to be there for this child, raising it. With you. But if you don\u2019t want that then you have to tell me because if you tell me when this kid is older\u2026. I don\u2019t think I can handle it. It would mean losing the child and losing you. I can\u2019t do that, y/n. So, tell me what you want. You decide.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>You didn\u2019t notice\nthe tears rolling down your face until a sob wrecked through your body. The things\nyou felt were so intense, you didn\u2019t even know you could feel so much at once. Love. Relief. Joy. Happiness. More love. Now you just had to put it into words, and that was harder than you thought.</p><p><br></p><p>Carol was waiting patiently, sitting in front of you with her hands clasped. She wanted to dry your tears and make you stop crying but she wasn\u2019t sure if that would be welcomed anymore. You sat up slowly and moved your legs over the bed, patting\nthe bed next to you. Carol moved carefully around you and sat down, careful not to touch you, however hard it was for her. <br></p><p><br></p><p>With a light chuckle you took her hands and as soon as your eyes locked you knew what you had to say. Everything that was in your head came pouring out.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI was scared you\u2019d leave. I didn\u2019t even realize I had excluded you from the whole thing\nuntil you were pacing in front of the bed. Of course, I want you to be a part of this. You are the softest, most patient and loving person I\u2019ve ever met. This baby will be lucky to have you raise it. Cause that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to\ndo. Raise it. Together.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Carol couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore. She grabbed your face and crashed your lips together, tasting both of you tears, while you moved with each other. Breaking the kiss and leaning your foreheads against each other you whispered softly \u201c I love you, too.\u201d <br></p><p><br></p><p>The smile that broke out on both of your faces made the following kisses a little awkward, but neither of you cared. You had a future; you were on the same page.\nYou were going to be parents.</p>",
                "content": "<p><b>&nbsp;A/n: Sorry it took a while but this one is looooong. I hope you like it though :)<br /></b></p><p><b>Warning: a little angst, a little fluff, and mentions of an asshole ex-boyfriend</b></p><p><b>Words: 7795<br /></b></p><p>&ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t do it, Nat. And he said he wasn&rsquo;t going to be a part of it, so I left.&rdquo; Sitting on the couch in the common room of the Avenger compound, you held your head in your hands fighting tears. Your best friend, Natasha Romanoff, was sitting next to you listening patiently. She had one hand on your back, slowly moving it up and down. &ldquo;Listen, you can do it. Don&rsquo;t worry about him, he&rsquo;s an asshole anyway.&rdquo; Chuckling\nyou looked up at your friend when another wave of tears hit you. Natasha frowned slightly and moved both her arms around your shaking body.</p><p><br /></p><p>The two of you met years ago, when you were recruited by Fury. Natasha was responsible for your training and even though the training was excruciating, you two became very close friends over the years. When your training was finished, you became Maria Hill&rsquo;s right hand and therefore worked really close with Fury himself. Every\nonce on a while you would be assigned to the team but normally, you would work\nwith &ldquo;normal&rdquo; agents.</p><p><br /></p><p>That was until a couple of months ago. Captain America himself walked into your office asking for you to work with the Avengers. At first, you declined, knowing it would\nmean a lot more work but when you talked to Nat and Clint about it, you couldn&rsquo;t stop yourself from agreeing. Much to the dismay of your then boyfriend. You had been together forever and everybody was sure the two of you would end up\ntogether. But he changed when you took the job with the Avengers, blaming you for\nthe downfall of the relationship and accusing you of prioritizing your job. But you stayed together anyway, the thought of breaking up not entering either of your minds.</p><p>Until a day ago. You found out you were pregnant and even though you had mixed feeling about it, you thought with the support you would get from your boyfriend and the\nteam, who had become like a family to you, everything would work out.</p><p><br /></p><p>But when you told him, all hell broke loose. He yelled at you. Screaming you wouldn&rsquo;t be a good mother and that the child wouldn&rsquo;t love you because you would be gone all\nthe time anyway. When he grabbed you and tried to convince you to have an abortion,\nyou couldn&rsquo;t stop yourself. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>You were a trained agent, but your calm and patient character kept you from freaking out\nin situations where other people would throw knives (other people meaning Natasha Romanoff). But this time you had enough, you pulled your arms out of his grip and hit him right in the face. Telling him it was over and that you&rsquo;d pick up your stuff when he wasn&rsquo;t home. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>That&rsquo;s how you ended up at the Avengers compound, knocking on Nat&rsquo;s door and spending the night in her room. In the morning, after breakfast, you sat on the couch and explained what happened. Natasha almost jumped up, ready to throw a knife at that asshole when she heard how he reacted. She calmed down very fast though when tears of\ndisappointment started rolling down your face. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>So, now you\nwere sitting on the couch, leaning into Natasha, who was trying to calm down. All of a sudden, the newest member of the team, Carol Danvers, came waltzing in. &ldquo;Hey Widow, you ready for me to kick your ass?&rdquo; The confident smile left her face when she studied the scene in front of her. You quickly moved away from your friend and dropped you head, not wanting her to see the state you were in.</p><p><br /></p><p>You didn&rsquo;t have the chance to really get to know Carol so far. You were both busy and quite\nfrankly didn&rsquo;t really have an interest in getting to know each other. You knew, you eventually had to approach the Captain but you had other problems at the time. That&rsquo;s why now it seemed awkward for Carol to ask if everything was alright, so instead she just stood there, stiff as a broom stick, staring at the two other\nwomen. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right  there Carol. I just have to&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;No, you should go.&rdquo; You didn&rsquo;t let the redhead finish that sentence. You knew that Nat didn&rsquo;t want to leave you alone, but if you were being honest the sadness you were feeling just a second go, was turning into anger and a workout didn&rsquo;t sound so bad. &ldquo;You know what?&rdquo; you started while getting up from the couch and walking towards the blonde. &ldquo;I could use a workout. And you and I don&rsquo;t know each other well, so let&rsquo;s do a getting-to-know-each-other spar.&rdquo; With a confident smile you waited for an answer from the other women, instead Nat spoke up. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Y/n, are you sure you should be working out?&rdquo; she asked quietly with a pointed look towards your belly. You weren&rsquo;t showing yet and for that you were happy because you weren&rsquo;t ready for people to find out about the baby quite yet. So quickly you held her hand up to stop her from continuing. &ldquo;Yes, why wouldn&rsquo;t I? It&rsquo;s just a\nlittle work out. It won&rsquo;t kill me.&rdquo; Turning your head back to Carol, who had been standing there without saying a word, you raised your eyebrows challenging her. &ldquo;Or is the mighty space cowboy scared?&rdquo; <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>That immediately caused a reaction, Carol straightened her back, always ready for a challenge. With a confident smirk on her face she answered. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not scared. But you should be. You don&rsquo;t know me, and I could kick your ass even without my powers.&rdquo; Raising\nyour eyebrows again, you hummed and took another step towards the hero. &ldquo;Alright then, mighty hero. We have special wristbands here that block most of your powers. How about you put one of those on and we make it a fair fight.&rdquo; <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Slightly taken aback, not knowing of such technology, Carol hesitated a second too long for you not to notice, causing your smirk to deepen. But she quickly shook her head and locked eyes with her opponent. &ldquo;Bring it, Agent y/l/n.&rdquo; Excited about having a way to get rid of your energy, you walked past Carol making your way to the lab to get the wristband, leaving a stunned Carol and a concerned Natasha in the room. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t be too hard on her. You could cause serious damage.&rdquo; <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Turning around facing the redhead, a frown formed on Carol&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;What do you mean? I thought she could handle herself.&rdquo; With a chuckle the former spy took a step towards the other woman. With a quiet voice she hoped no one could hear her. &ldquo;Oh, she can handle herself just fine. I trained her after all. But things are a little&hellip;.tense at the moment. So, just don&rsquo;t hit too hard ok.&rdquo; <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Seeing the serious expression on Natasha&rsquo;s face, Carol&rsquo;s face softened and she nodded her head. She may not know exactly what&rsquo;s going on but judging on what she walked\nin to, it must be something serious. &ldquo;Yeah. Alright. I&rsquo;ll watch out.&rdquo; With a thankful smile Natasha pointed at the door. &ldquo;Well, then. Let&rsquo;s go, I&rsquo;m sure y/n is already waiting.&rdquo; <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Making their way to the training room, the were met with a sight Carol would always remember as the first moment she felt something stir in her guts. There you\nwere, in the tightest workout clothes that existed and a huge smile on your face. Snapping herself out of the stupor, Carol caught up to the redhead, who was already half way across the room. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Alright new friend. Put this thing on and let&rsquo;s get started.&rdquo; With a suggestive smile you moved the wristband in front of Carol&rsquo;s face. You felt giddy and excited, almost forgetting about everything with your ex. Even though you didn&rsquo;t know it yet, it was clear that distracting you from problems would be one of Carol&rsquo;s specialties. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>With a sigh Carol took the wristband and snapped it around her wrist, immediately feeling some kind of numbness. The power she felt lingering under her skin at all times was gone and she wasn&rsquo;t sure how she felt about it. With a sympathetic pad to Carol&rsquo;s shoulder, Natasha started talking. &ldquo;Here are some ground rules.&rdquo; <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>You interrupted her with a loud groan and an eyeroll. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re adults, we don&rsquo;t need\nground rules.&rdquo; Rolling her eyes Natasha snapped at her &ldquo;Yes, we do. So shut up and listen. Number one: no serious injuries, you tap out if it&rsquo;s too much. Number two: when I say stop, you both stop. Immediately. And lastly number three: Don&rsquo;t you dare lose, y/n. I trained you and you have to make me proud.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>With a confident smile you made your way towards the sparring matt. &ldquo;Please, Nat. Have\nsome faith.&rdquo; Shaking her head Carol made her way towards you. The feeling of excitement rushing through your body, ready to kick some ass. The Captain doesn&rsquo;t like fighting without her powers, it reminded her too much of Yon-rogg and how he would always scold her, but for some reason when she looked at you and how\nyou jumped up and down to warm up a little bit, she couldn&rsquo;t help but look forward to doing this. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Already in her workout clothes, Carol got ready, standing opposite of you. Natasha was the referee and therefore the one to start the &ldquo;fight&rdquo;. &ldquo;Ready,&hellip;fight&rdquo; You started circling each other. You had never fought each other before, so you both had to figure out the other one first. Plus, Carol had to get used to her human strength, which proved to be a little more difficult than she&rsquo;d expected.</p><p><br /></p><p>After more than a minute, you took a step forward swinging at Carol. She blocked the hit and that&rsquo;s when the fight got intense. Both of you throwing punches but never landing, yet Carol got closer to beating you than the other way around. It continued like that for a while, until something made Carol lose her focus. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Your shirt started riding up from all the movement and only for a split second, Carol&rsquo;s eyes left\nyours and instead travelled towards the revealed skin. Barely a second being enough, you landed a hard punch to the other one&rsquo;s face making her stumble. Followed by a kick to her chest, Carol landed with her back on the mat. Sensing your win, you threw yourself on top of the on the ground laying woman and prevented her from getting up. Without her super strength Carol didn&rsquo;t stand a chance and reluctantly\ntapped out.</p><p><br /></p><p>With an incredibly wide smile, you jumped off Carol and threw your arms in the air. &ldquo;Yes! I won.&rdquo; You\nexclaimed loudly. Normally Carol would be pissed, she hated losing but for some\nreason all she could do was smile at your excitement. Priding herself in making\nyou laugh after seeing you cry onto Natasha&rsquo;s shoulder- Carol walked up to you with her hand held out for a congratulatory handshake. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Instead of taking it, you automatically moved your arms around the blonde woman, embracing her tightly, surprising not just the hero but yourself. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; The soft whisper hit Carol&rsquo;s ear causing goosebumps to break out all over her body. Taken aback she just put her arms around your waist and squeezed gently. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>From the corner of the room Natasha just watched the interaction. On the one hand she felt immense proud, but she was also curious about Carol&rsquo;s reaction. Of course, the spy saw the movement of her eyes and she couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder what had gotten into the Captain. She had known Carol longer and better than you, but she hadn&rsquo;t seen her acting like that. Ever. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Before Natasha could finish her line of thought you spoke up, while leaving the embrace with a slight blush on your cheeks. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to head out now. I have to take care of some stuff but thanks for the workout.&rdquo; Before Natasha could say anything, you ehad already left the room with a wave towards the other women. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Startling Carol while she was taking off her wristband, Natasha eyed her suspiciously. &ldquo;How\ncome you lost? You dominated her most of the time.&rdquo; Shrugging but not making eye\ncontact the answer was a short one. &ldquo;You wanted me to go easy on her, so I did.&rdquo; <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Before Natasha could say anything in return, that may have caused a conversation Carol didn&rsquo;t want to have right now, she quickly spoke up again. &ldquo;Well now that I got my ass kicked, I need to kick someone else&rsquo;s. Ready to do what we originally\ncame here for.&rdquo; Moving towards the new Avenger, Natasha forgot what she wanted\nto say and started smirking. &ldquo;Hell yeah. Let&rsquo;s get this started.&rdquo; <br /></p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>After the sparring session, you and Carol got a closer. You had picked up most of your stuff from your old apartment and Tony offered you a room on the compound. You felt like you were officially a part of the team. Living at the same place as Carol\nseemed to make the getting to know each other a lot easier. You easily fell into a routine. You&rsquo;d work out together every other morning, sparring or just doing some weightlifting, of course you took it a little slower but without being suspicious. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Natasha was still the only one who knew about you being pregnant and for the time being that was exactly what you wanted. You weren&rsquo;t ready to tell anybody, simply because you hadn&rsquo;t dealt with it yourself. Every once in a while, Natasha would join you other two in the morning but mostly it was just Carol and yourself. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>One day, approximately two weeks after the first time you sparred together, you didn&rsquo;t show up in the training room. It worried Carol, you were very punctual, in the time you had been training together, there wasn&rsquo;t on time you came in later than five minutes earlier. When you didn&rsquo;t show up after fifteen minutes, Carol made her way towards your room, which was on the other side of where Carol had hers. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>She would be lying if she said she wasn&rsquo;t worried. For some reason you had completely broken down her walls within such a small amount of time. You talked often after your workouts, with Carol sharing things she normally didn&rsquo;t tell anyone, not even Fury. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>She explained how she got her powers and how she was &lsquo;abducted&rsquo; by the Kree. How lonely and confused she was when she couldn&rsquo;t remember her past. She talked about her shock, when she read the file about her and Mar-vell&rsquo;s plans. She went into detail with it all, even the bad stuff she did for the Kree, but you didn&rsquo;t judge her. Not once. Carol felt safe around you, like she could just be herself and in return she felt like you opened up, too. And you did.</p><p><br /></p><p>You explained how you were recruited and how terrible your training was with Natasha. But it still was the best time you have had; Carol could tell that the bond you two had was very deep and important to both of you. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>One day Carol talked to Natasha about you and she found out that you were pretty much the only one everybody opened up, too. Whether that was Tony about his nightmares about the battle of New York or how he struggled with forgiving Bucky for killing his parents, or Steve talking about his lost life and his ache about what he could&rsquo;ve had with Peggy. No matter who it was, they all came to you because you made everyone feel the same way Carol felt. Accepted, listened to and most importantly not judged.</p><p><br /></p><p>While the blonde made her way to your room, she couldn&rsquo;t help but think about how amazing she thinks you are and how important you have become to her. An involuntary smile etched its way onto her face, while her heart sped up with the thought. As soon as she arrived at her destination though, that smile dropped immediately when she heard weird sounds coming from the inside of the room.</p><p><br /></p><p>Quickly she opened the door, when she saw no one in the main part of the room her head snapped to the bathroom when she heard you. Walking towards the sound she sighed in relive when she saw you sitting on the ground. But the feeling quickly changed when she realized what was going on. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>You were leaning over the toilet with your hair pulled back. You didn&rsquo;t react when Carol entered the room, because you hadn&rsquo;t even realized someone was there. Only when cold hands made their way onto your forehead and back did you look up into beautiful but concerned, brown eyes. &ldquo;Carol? What are you doing here?&rdquo; With a soft voice, that could only be heard because you were so close to each other, the blonde woman answered while continuing to rub your back soothingly.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You were late, and normally you&rsquo;re not. I was worried and it seems like I had every right to be.&rdquo; Before you could formulate an answer, your eyes got big when you felt your stomach grumble. Fast you turned your head back over the toilet, ready to have all remnants of food leave your body. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Silence settled over the two of you, only interrupted by painful souding dry heaving coming from you. When you were sure there was nothing left, that could leave your body, you leaned back against Carol. The warmth coming from her calming you down tremendously. For a moment Carol relished the moment of closeness, realizing how comfortable she felt with your body against hers.</p><p><br /></p><p>She was still worried though and didn&rsquo;t want you to get cold, so she gently moved some strands of hair out of your pale face and whispered &ldquo;Y/n, hey. Come on you should go to bed and rest.&rdquo; Huffing, you opened your eyes and sat up, immediately missing the contact. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m fine. I just don&rsquo;t think I can spar with you today.&rdquo; You didn&rsquo;t want to have to explain why you didn&rsquo;t have a fever, so just acting like nothing had happened seemed like a better option.</p><p><br /></p><p>Slowly you started getting up, feeling better already. Seems like pregnant-vomiting doesn&rsquo;t make you feel as bad as flue-vomiting. Carol on the other hand was still worried, not wanting you to overwhelm yourself, she grabbed your elbow steadying you. &ldquo;Whoa, whoa. Come on y/n, you&rsquo;re sick and you need to rest. Not everyone can be immune to everything like I am.&rdquo; With a smile Carol got you to laugh out loud.</p><p><br /></p><p>In your time together you quickly realized, that was one of the Captains talents. You hadn&rsquo;t laughed that much in a very long time, at least not with an almost stranger. And Carol took every chance she had to see you smile or hear your laugh. It made her heart jump in excitement, feeling like an addict every time she succeeded. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>You felt the same way, amazed with the fact that Carol could distract you from all of your worries and problems almost as soon as she entered the room. But you were apprehensive, not wanting to act on any of those feelings bubbling under the surface.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, Carol.&rdquo; You snapped at the other woman, instead of thanking her, when she tried to push you towards the bed. Not expecting such a reaction coming from you, since she had never seen you angry or genuinely annoyed, Caro pulled her hands away as if she had been burnt. You hadn&rsquo;t told anybody about your pregnancy yet, obviously. So far, Natasha was still the only one who knew, and it was important to you that it stayed that way. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Every once in a while, though, you felt like telling Carol everything and be as open with\nher as the Captain was with you, but something kept you from doing so. Maybe your growing feelings for the woman had something to do with it, but again, you wouldn&rsquo;t even acknowledge them. Who the hell would want to start a relationship with a pregnant woman? <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>But now, standing in you room and looking at Carol, who had a hurt look on her face, you started feeling guilty. Nonetheless you couldn&rsquo;t bring your mouth to say the words and come clean, scared of the reaction. &ldquo;Alright, whatever you say.&rdquo; Turning away from you, Carol made her way towards the door wanting to get out of here. She\nwas surprised by her own feelings, not understanding why she was so hurt by you\nsnapping at her.</p><p><br /></p><p>As the\nguilt spread through your body you wanted to stop the other woman from leaving. You had felt safe leaning against her with Carol&rsquo;s soft touches against your face, but your body wouldn&rsquo;t move from the spot two feet away from the bed. You were simply too scared by the outcome of everything. You also had no idea how you would handle the whole baby situation, even though Natasha constantly tried to talk to you about it, you hadn&rsquo;t even met with a doctor yet. You were completely overwhelmed with everything.</p><p><br /></p><p>You felt\ntears welling up in your eyes when you sat down on your bed, feeling hopeless and absolutely defeated. You were exhausted from all the thinking and the throwing up, so you laid down, curled up into a ball and fell asleep.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>It had been a couple of days since the incident in your room and you hadn&rsquo;t talked to each other ever since. So, when you walked into the kitchen one morning, you weren&rsquo;t prepared to see Carol and Nat sitting on the table having breakfast together. Before you could turn around though, you locked eyes with Carol. Neither could look away, both realizing how much you had missed the other even though it had only been a couple of days. With a deep breath you walked over to the woman who had been on you mind constantly and spoke softly. &ldquo;Hey Carol, uhm could we talk for a second?&rdquo; <br /></p><p>Sensing the serious tone and knowing what had happened between you two, Natasha cleared her throat. &ldquo;I have something to do anyway.&rdquo; With a soft smile to both women and an encouraging squeeze to your hand, the spy made her way out of the kitchen. As soon as she was out of earshot you started rambling. You couldn&rsquo;t stop the words from literally falling out of your mouth.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m really sorry Carol. I shouldn&rsquo;t have snapped at you; I know you only wanted to help. I just have a lot on my mind but that&rsquo;s no excuse. I shouldn&rsquo;t treat you that way, you deserve better than that. I mean, I know I&rsquo;ve only known you like three weeks, but I like you. I do. And I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; Wide eyed, you stopped yourself from speaking and looked up. When you saw Carol smiling softly, all you could do was exhale loudly, knowing you were forgiven. &ldquo;I understand. It&rsquo;s okay just don&rsquo;t do that again or I&rsquo;ll kick your ass. This time <b>with</b> my powers.&rdquo; After a short break, Carol&rsquo;s smile was replaced with a frown. You felt her heart speed up when Carol got up from her chair and slowly reached out to take your hands, making sure you had every chance to pull away if you wanted to.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You know, you can talk to me about the things that are on your mind. It may not seem like it sometimes, but I can be a good listener.&rdquo; A soft chuckle escaped her mouth while she continued rubbing her thumbs over the back of your hands, leaving a tingling sensation behind. It was a tender moment between you two, causing you\nboth to release shaky breaths. You dropped your gaze, fixating on your joint hands. You felt safe, like Carol was going to protect you, and for a split second you allowed your feelings to come rushing to the surface. You were shocked when you realized how hard your heart was pounding, you were sure Carol could hear or maybe even feel it through your hands.</p><p><br /></p><p>But that moment went away quickly, when your mind went back to what was going through your head in the first place. It&rsquo;s like you were stuck. You wanted to tell Carol everything but you just <b>couldn&rsquo;t. </b>It was too much, so instead you settled for an answer you hoped would keep Carol from asking again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of that. I just can&rsquo;t talk about it just yet. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; With an apologetic look, you squeezed Carol&rsquo;s hands. Nodding slowly, slightly disappointed by the answer, Carol let go of your hands.</p><p><br /></p><p>You felt cold suddenly. Like the warmth left your body when your hands stopped touching. So, you quickly grabbed the retreating hands and took a small step forward. &ldquo;How about we go back to our routine? Just minus the sparring, I think I need a break from that. But we could still have lunch and you know hang out or work some files together.&rdquo; <i>As long as I can spend time with you.</i> The last part was left unsaid, as much as you wanted to voice that thought, you couldn&rsquo;t.</p><p><br /></p><p>With a smirk on her face Carol pulled you a little closer, surprising you with her boldness.\n&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t get enough of me, huh?&rdquo; &nbsp;Her smirk\nturned into a smile when she heard that full laugh she learned to love. Locking eyes, you realized how close you were, but instead of feeling awkward or scared, both of you savored that moment. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>After your talk, things returned to their normal routine. Well, instead of working out together\nyou had lunch every day. You helped Carol understanding the new earth technology and most nights were spent watching movies together. Whenever Carol had a mission, you would welcome her back with food and a chill night, so the hero could relax. It felt nice, domestic even.</p><p><br /></p><p>Months went by like this, and during that time your relationship shifted. It intensified and so did your feelings for each other. It became harder and harder for you to hide them. Added to your inner turmoil, the pregnancy progressed as well. After\na long talk with Natasha, you finally decided to go to a doctor. You checked everything out and felt a weight lift of your shoulders when all the results were positive ones. You hadn&rsquo;t heard from your ex in weeks. All in all, you felt happy and Carol, of course, had a major part in it.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Alright how about Chicken? Or we could just order some pizza, maybe some French food. No wait, I don&rsquo;t like that&rdquo; You walked into the kitchen, Carol following closely. She had an amused smirk on her face listening to you counting all the food options that existed. Halting in the kitchen you turned around with wide\neyes &ldquo;Oh my god, Hot Dogs!&rdquo; you could eat tons of food at the moment. You craved everything, not so much disgusting things like they always show in movies, but just food in general. So, when Carol told you her mission was cancelled\nyour head immediately went to dinner.</p><p><br /></p><p>With a chuckle Carol put her hands on your shoulders holding you still. &ldquo;How about we make it official, huh? I&rsquo;ll take you to a nice restaurant, you can eat everything you want, and I&rsquo;ll pay.&rdquo; Just like that the smile dropped from your face. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>When the realization of being asked out by the woman you most definitely had some feelings for, hit you, your head went blank. Your lack of answer caused Carol to pull back disappointed. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want that, that&rsquo;s ok. I just thought, you know, in the past week we&hellip;..&rdquo; you had never seen her like this. She was embarrassed but also sad and for some reason you couldn&rsquo;t live with the fact that you caused\nher to feel that way.</p><p><br /></p><p>Your mouth acted on its own, it had gotten you in trouble before and now there was no difference. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pregnant.&rdquo; Silence. Carol&rsquo;s face went through a hundred emotions within a second and lastly it settled on a confused frown. Closing and opening her mouth she tried to find anything to say but came up with nothing. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Knowing there was no going back now, you realized you had to explain it to her. &ldquo;Remember the day you walked in on Nat and me? When I was crying?&rdquo; Carol just nodded, no words escaping her mouth. With a sigh you gently guided her towards the couch. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we sit down.&rdquo; Slowly you both made your way towards the couch, with you sitting down further away from her than the two of you had gotten used to.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well, I found out I was pregnant, told my boyfriend and he freaked out, so I broke up with him and came here. Nat took care of me, she&rsquo;s good at that. When you and I got closer, I wanted to tell you, believe me. But I was scared how you would\nreact. Now, though, I&rsquo;m starting to show slowly, and I don&rsquo;t think I could&rsquo;ve kept it from you any longer.&rdquo; <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Letting out a long breath you looked at the woman facing you. Her eyes locked onto your belly that was a little rounder than it used to be. Still not responding you continued. You had spilled so much already, may as well go all the way. &ldquo;I like you, Carol. A lot actually, but I&rsquo;m pregnant and that&rsquo;s not going to change. I just don&rsquo;t want you to do something you or even I could regret in the future.&rdquo; <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>And that was it. Everything was out in the open and how things would go from here, was solely up to the woman trying to comprehend everything. After minutes of silence you felt yourself tearing up. This was exactly what you feared. Now the only person, you actually liked would walk away from you and you would be alone. Leaning back on\nto the couch you used your hands to cover your face. You couldn&rsquo;t watch her walk away; it would be too much.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;So, no sushi then.&rdquo; Hearing her voice so loud and clear you moved your hands and snapped your head in Carol&rsquo;s direction. Looking at her face you were the one that was confused now. She showed no sign of shock or anything like that. A\nsoft smile grazed her lips as her eyes locked with yours.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;W-what?&rdquo; your brain refused to comprehend what was happening. Your heart started fluttering in your chest but you weren&rsquo;t sure if it was because you were happy or because of your nerves. You couldn&rsquo;t move, even when Carol scooched closer to you and took your hands in hers. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Listen y/n. Am I surprised about all of this? God, yes. But I don&rsquo;t care. I like you and you&rsquo;re important to me so I would like to take you out. We just can&rsquo;t have\nsushi because pregnant people aren&rsquo;t aloud to eat that.&rdquo; Her eyes twinkled in humor. She waited patiently for you to understand that she wouldn&rsquo;t walk away and simply continued holding on to your hands. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>When you were finally convinced Carol wasn&rsquo;t joking, the tears in your eyes started falling down. Worried, Carol moved one of her hands to your face and wiped them away. &ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s wrong? Don&rsquo;t cry, please.&rdquo; She came even closer and wrapped you in a warm hug. You felt just like the time you had leaned against her on your bathroom floor. Safe. Protected.</p><p><br /></p><p>Not wanting to keep her waiting for an answer, you took a deep breath and pulled away from her, but just enough so you could look her in the eyes. Your hand found her leg that was perched on the couch and you slowly started smiling. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Congratulations Ms. Danvers, you got yourself a date with a pregnant lady.&rdquo; Laughing, Carol leaned forward almost touching your lips, making your heart pound like crazy. Before your\nlips touched you could feel her whisper against them instead. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my pleasure.&rdquo; With a smirk she pulled away and got up in one swift motion, leaving you on the couch with surprised look on your face.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well, get ready. We&rsquo;re leaving in thirty minutes.&rdquo; Carol quickly made her way out of the room leaving you on the couch. You couldn&rsquo;t stop the smile from forming on your face. After several weeks of hiding your feelings and ignoring them you could finally\nlet go. You squealed in excitement and threw yourself on the couch. </p><p>Laying there\nyou touched the soft curve of your belly and did something you hadn&rsquo;t done before.\n&ldquo;Hey little human. Your mommy has a date.&rdquo; Smiling you slowly moved up to get\nready for dinner. It seemed like a weight was lifted from your chest. You weren&rsquo;t worried about your ex; you weren&rsquo;t worried about Carol leaving but most importantly you weren&rsquo;t worried about the baby that was growing inside of you. For\nthe first time in a while, you felt completely at ease, ready for the future.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s how he lost his eye. It was Goose.&rdquo; Shocked, you leaned back in your chair, mouth agape not believing what Carol just told you. Fury lost his eye because of a cat. Well, a Flerken but still. &ldquo;Wow, Fury is one dramatic son of a bitch.&rdquo; The blonde woman sitting opposite from you broke out into laughter and you couldn&rsquo;t\nhelp but join.</p><p><br /></p><p>It had been\nan amazing evening; Carol had taken you to a little restaurant not far from the\ncompound. You had talked all night like you always did but this time it felt different,\nmore intimate. You had finally told her the rest of the story about your boyfriend, sharing your thoughts as well as the fear you had because of the baby. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>The superhero surprised you by how head on she was facing the whole situation. At first you thought Carol would just ignore the fact that you were pregnant and act like this was a normal date, but you quickly realized that was not the\ncase. Carol was concerned and even a little overprotective. She even refused to fly you to the restaurant saying it could hurt the baby.</p><p><br /></p><p>You were shaken from your thoughts when a warm hand clasped yours. &ldquo;Hey, are you ok?&rdquo; She was always so soft with you. Before you had met her all those weeks ago, you had heard people complain about her being arrogant and mean. But in the time\nyou had known her she hadn&rsquo;t been like that once. Maybe it was because the\nother ones were insecure men that couldn&rsquo;t handle a woman being stronger than them, but you didn&rsquo;t care. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>You simply enjoyed the moment and smiled softly at the contact. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. In fact, I&rsquo;m\nhappy. Thank you, Carol.&rdquo; With a light squeeze to your hand she pulled away, leaving you aching for her touch. &ldquo;My pleasure. Shall we?&rdquo; She pointed at the door and raised her eyebrows. Smiling you nodded and moved to get up.</p><p><br /></p><p>The cold air hit you face as soon as you stepped out, making you shiver. Before you could say something, you felt a warm arm sneak around your waist. Looking down\nyou realized the woman next to you was glowing, making you chuckle. &ldquo;You know,\nthis can be very useful.&rdquo; Smirking down at you she pulled you even closer. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t seen the rest of it.&rdquo; <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>With a wink she moved her head to look at the sky. You couldn&rsquo;t help but look at her, your eyes studying every feature of her face. Starting at her eyes down to the sharp jawline, that made your knees buckle. When your eyes landed on her lips you noticed they were moving. When she looked down at you with amused eyes and a smirk you\ncouldn&rsquo;t stop the red heat rising in your face.</p><p><br /></p><p>Stopping her movement Carol stepped in front of you, her hand not leaving its place around your waist, and her other hand coming up to touch the side of your face. Her boldness surprised you once again but all you could focus on were the lips that were so\nclose to your own. Leaning in closer you heard her whisper. &ldquo;Can I kiss you?&rdquo; <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t help but melt at the question. You couldn&rsquo;t remember a single time your ex ever asked for consent, not that he ever did something without it, but the specific\nquestion was never asked. Without answering you leaned in, capturing the awaiting lips in your own. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>With the first touch you could feel tingles all over your body. You moved your hand to her neck and one sunk in her hair, while Carol tightened her grip around your waist with both arms and pulled you flush against her. Your lips moved in unison and when Carol asked for entrance by biting your lower lip, you couldn&rsquo;t help but moan, opening your mouth. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>You didn&rsquo;t know how long you were standing there but when the kiss broke because of the need for air, you leaned your forehead against hers. Staying in the tight embrace, Carol moved in for another short, soft kiss before she spoke up. &ldquo;We\nshould go. I don&rsquo;t want you getting sick for real this time.&rdquo; You placed one more kiss on her lips before you agreed and the two of you made your way back\nhome. The entire time, the glowing arm around you didn&rsquo;t leave its place.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>After the first date things developed fairly quickly, but not in an uncomfortable pace. Soon you both realized how time flies when you had to go to the doctor to get checked out. You had just entered the sixth month and you were showing clearly. In the\ntime between the first date and now, you and Carol had taken big steps with\neach other. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Soft kisses turned into make out sessions and those turned into sex. Sex with Carol was unlike\nanything you had ever felt. From the very beginning she made sure that you felt\nsafe and comfortable but at the same time she was relentless. You were impressed with how soft she was when it came to your pregnancy though. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>One night\nwhen you were laying in bed, her arm beneath your neck and a hand on your belly, you were ready to fall asleep when suddenly Carol&rsquo;s quick movement startled you. Within a second, she had sat up and had both of her hands on your belly. Moving her head between your face and your belly she whispered loudly. &ldquo;Did you see\nthat? Did you <b>feel </b>that?&rdquo; Confused\nyou were going to ask her what she meant when it happened again.</p><p><br /></p><p> A soft movement in your belly made you realize what she meant. &ldquo;Oh that? That&rsquo;s been going on for a couple of days now, I think it&rsquo;s the baby kicking.&rdquo; You tried to move into a sitting position but Carol&rsquo;s face made you stop. Her excited smile she had been wearing the moment she moved\nup, was replaced by a hurt frown. You didn&rsquo;t understand what had happened, so you lifted your hand and put it on hers on your belly. &ldquo;What is it, Carol?&rdquo; No answer. The only thing that changed was the hands leaving your belly, leaving a cold feeling in the place where they had been before. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Carol moved away from you and got up from the bed. You only watched how she started pacing in front of your bed with her hands on her forehead. &ldquo;Carol? What is wrong?&rdquo; Fear rushed\nthrough your body and you could hear your own heartbeat. This was the moment. Carol was going to leave, she finally understood how serious this is and now she changed\nher mind and wants to go. You couldn&rsquo;t believe it. Tears gathered in your eyes when the realization hit you. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>You wanted to get up and yell at her for playing with you for <b>weeks, </b>making you think she was going to be there. But you were too weak. The cold fear made you freeze and stay seated on the bed. When you didn&rsquo;t\nhear her steps echoing through the room anymore, you looked up. What you saw,\nsurprised you. There she was, the strongest Avenger, with tears rolling down her\nface. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me? I thought we&hellip;.. I thought you and I, we &hellip;..Why\ndidn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo; <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Now you were speechless, all this time you had thought she was going to leave anyway,\nso you didn&rsquo;t include her in the first place. You remembered the fight you had\nwhen you took Natasha with you to the doctor instead of her. You didn&rsquo;t understand why she was so mad about it, because you didn&rsquo;t <b>try </b>to understand. Having been so caught up in your own head, you completely disregarded her feelings.</p><p><br /></p><p>Before you\ncould even start to stutter an answer, Carol opened her mouth again, breaking your heart. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want me to be involved, just tell me. I&rsquo;m a big girl, I can handle it, but don&rsquo;t you dare play with me. It&rsquo;s not fair.&rdquo; You didn&rsquo;t\nknow what to say. Your head was all over the place, your heart was beating faster when you finally understood, that Carol was all in. She <b>wanted </b>to be involved. She <b>wanted </b>to be there, and you wouldn&rsquo;t let her.</p><p><br /></p><p>Determined you got up from the bed and walked towards the woman you now knew you loved. &ldquo;Carol, I &hellip;&rdquo; a groan interrupted your words. Pain. You belly was hurting, something was wrong. You placed your hands on your belly and looked up at Carol with wide eyes. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Carol,\nsomething is wrong. It hurts.&rdquo; As if the last minutes hadn&rsquo;t happened Carol took a step forward and took your face in her hands. &ldquo;Stay calm, I&rsquo;m going to get you to the hospital.&rdquo; Now she was in her element. Staying calm under\npressure was her job and she couldn&rsquo;t panic now. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>She picked\nyou up carefully, wincing when another contraction (at least you assumed it was\none) forced a gasp out of your mouth. &ldquo;Breathe. We&rsquo;ll be right there. Just keep breathing.&rdquo; Only when Carol started glowing, you realized you were in the air. Just a few minutes later you already landed in front of the hospital, with you\nin her arms, Carol made her way inside. Walking up to the nurse, she frantically started talking. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s pregnant, in her second trimester and she&rsquo;s feeling contractions, I think. It&rsquo;s too soon. You need to help her.&rdquo; <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>The nurse and Carol started arguing but you weren&rsquo;t listening. The contractions (?)\nstopped but you were tired anyway. You were going to sleep after all before this whole debacle happened. You slowly closed your eyes ready to fall asleep in your girlfriend&rsquo;s arms when you were rudely awoken. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>You opened your eyes when the warmth left your body and you were placed in a hospital bed with Carol by your side. She was nervous, she played with her hands and had a very focused look on her face. She always got that, when she needed to keep her cool. You couldn&rsquo;t keep your eyes away from her, watching her with adoration visible on your face.</p><p><br /></p><p>When the doctor left after he checked you out, a long breath of relief left both of your\nmouths. Diagnose: Braxton hicks contractions. False alarm and no danger whatsoever. You should be happy, and you were, but your thoughts were somewhere else. So were Carol&rsquo;s, she was still nervous, slightly less now that she knew the baby was safe, but she was thinking about what to say.</p><p><br /></p><p>Taking a\ndeep breath Carol broke her silence. &ldquo;I need you to listen to me now. I love you. I do. It&rsquo;s crazy, we&rsquo;ve known each other for less than a year but I can&rsquo;t help feeling what I feel.&rdquo; Your heart started pounding, speechless you were laying there not able to make a sound. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>You didn&rsquo;t need to, the Hero wasn&rsquo;t done yet. With a soft smile on her face she laid her\nhands on top of your belly and continued with a soft voice. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I also\nlove this baby. I want to be a part of this. I knew what I was getting into when I went on that date with you. And I wouldn&rsquo;t change it for the world. I want to be there for this child, raising it. With you. But if you don&rsquo;t want that then you have to tell me because if you tell me when this kid is older&hellip;. I don&rsquo;t think I can handle it. It would mean losing the child and losing you. I can&rsquo;t do that, y/n. So, tell me what you want. You decide.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>You didn&rsquo;t notice\nthe tears rolling down your face until a sob wrecked through your body. The things\nyou felt were so intense, you didn&rsquo;t even know you could feel so much at once. Love. Relief. Joy. Happiness. More love. Now you just had to put it into words, and that was harder than you thought.</p><p><br /></p><p>Carol was waiting patiently, sitting in front of you with her hands clasped. She wanted to dry your tears and make you stop crying but she wasn&rsquo;t sure if that would be welcomed anymore. You sat up slowly and moved your legs over the bed, patting\nthe bed next to you. Carol moved carefully around you and sat down, careful not to touch you, however hard it was for her. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>With a light chuckle you took her hands and as soon as your eyes locked you knew what you had to say. Everything that was in your head came pouring out.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I was scared you&rsquo;d leave. I didn&rsquo;t even realize I had excluded you from the whole thing\nuntil you were pacing in front of the bed. Of course, I want you to be a part of this. You are the softest, most patient and loving person I&rsquo;ve ever met. This baby will be lucky to have you raise it. Cause that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to\ndo. Raise it. Together.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Carol couldn&rsquo;t hold it in anymore. She grabbed your face and crashed your lips together, tasting both of you tears, while you moved with each other. Breaking the kiss and leaning your foreheads against each other you whispered softly &ldquo; I love you, too.&rdquo; <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>The smile that broke out on both of your faces made the following kisses a little awkward, but neither of you cared. You had a future; you were on the same page.\nYou were going to be parents.</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p><b>&nbsp;A/n: Sorry it took a while but this one is looooong. I hope you like it though :)<br /></b></p>\n<p><b>Warning: a little angst, a little fluff, and mentions of an asshole ex-boyfriend</b></p>\n<p><b>Words: 7795<br /></b></p>\n<p>&ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t do it, Nat. And he said he wasn&rsquo;t going to be a part of it, so I left.&rdquo; Sitting on the couch in the common room of the Avenger compound, you held your head in your hands fighting tears. Your best friend, Natasha Romanoff, was sitting next to you listening patiently. She had one hand on your back, slowly moving it up and down. &ldquo;Listen, you can do it. Don&rsquo;t worry about him, he&rsquo;s an asshole anyway.&rdquo; Chuckling\nyou looked up at your friend when another wave of tears hit you. Natasha frowned slightly and moved both her arms around your shaking body.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>The two of you met years ago, when you were recruited by Fury. Natasha was responsible for your training and even though the training was excruciating, you two became very close friends over the years. When your training was finished, you became Maria Hill&rsquo;s right hand and therefore worked really close with Fury himself. Every\nonce on a while you would be assigned to the team but normally, you would work\nwith &ldquo;normal&rdquo; agents.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>That was until a couple of months ago. Captain America himself walked into your office asking for you to work with the Avengers. At first, you declined, knowing it would\nmean a lot more work but when you talked to Nat and Clint about it, you couldn&rsquo;t stop yourself from agreeing. Much to the dismay of your then boyfriend. You had been together forever and everybody was sure the two of you would end up\ntogether. But he changed when you took the job with the Avengers, blaming you for\nthe downfall of the relationship and accusing you of prioritizing your job. But you stayed together anyway, the thought of breaking up not entering either of your minds.</p>\n</p>",

Eyes and cheeks wet with tears. &ldquo;You have grown into a gorgeous woman.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mother?&rdquo; You choke out moving closer to her &ldquo;How are you here?

Just my imagination playing games with me.&rdquo;</p><p>She reaches out and cups your cheeks. Her touch, despite standing by the open window, was warm.

I had so many questions, but now- I just-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; She kissed the top of your head &ldquo;Sometimes a hug says a thousand words.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why Rayna?&rdquo; You blurt out &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lovely name, but why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It means Queen, you <i>are</i> Thor&rsquo;s first born, and therefore rightfully in line for the throne of Asgard. I didn&rsquo;t want you to forget that.&rdquo; She sighed &ldquo;I planned on telling your father once he returned from Vanaheim. We were going to find you on Midgard and bring you home, and get married. But-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You fell ill.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And Odin all but banished my family from the palace. They couldn&rsquo;t reach your father.&rdquo; She gasps &ldquo;You have met your father haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s very protective of me. Nearly choked my boyfriend when he found out about us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A boyfriend?&rdquo; A wide joyful smile showed up on her face &ldquo;And you let me ramble on?&rdquo;</p><p>You shrug.&ldquo;I wanted to hear your voice.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I want to know about my daughter. Your eyes tell a story far more painful than a lost mother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose you could say that.&rdquo; You sigh &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t exactly brought up in a caring home.&rdquo;</p><p>For the first time, you tell your whole backstory. Being found by Hydra, conditioned to become an assassin and weapon. Finding Steve, finding Thor, Gainor and Cadence, even Odin. Up to meeting Shuri and getting your head settled. No one ever managed to get the full story out of you before, it&rsquo;s no surprise the first person would be your mother.</p><p>&ldquo;My poor child. I should&rsquo;ve never let you leave my arms.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\u2019m safe now. I have found my family.&rdquo; You squeezed her hand.</p><p>&ldquo;You have Steve.&rdquo; Your mother touches you face again &ldquo;You&rsquo;re beginning to warm up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you regret any of it?&rdquo; You rest your head on her shoulder, sitting on the chaise lounge and watching the peak of light rising over the mountains through the snow. You could feel yourself being pulled away, waking up even, a sofft tapping echoed in your ears. Only so much time left in this blissful state with your mother.</p><p>&ldquo;Think maybe if you never had me, or never met my father.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;One should never dwell on what they believe are the regrets in their lives. You miss all the possibilities to come when you do. I do not regret you, for you are my gift to the world. All children are.&rdquo; Her voice starts to become distant</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to lose you again.&rdquo; You whisper</p><p>&ldquo;Carry my love with you, and I am never lost. My beautiful Rayna.&rdquo;</p><p>* * *</p><p>You fell forward, being caught by two pairs of arms, gasping for air. Shuri places a hand to your back, grounding you.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re alright, everything is okay.&rdquo; She tells you</p><p>You begin to straighten up and scan over the room, it appears as if nothing changed besides the clothes they wore. It was hard to tell if anything truly happened.</p><p>&ldquo;How do you feel?&rdquo; Shuri asks</p><p>&ldquo;The same, I don&rsquo;t think it worked.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Only one way to truly know.&rdquo; She says knowingly</p><p>You frowned a bit but agree. &ldquo;Just be careful.&rdquo; You pulled away from the other scientist who held on to your arm to keep you from falling.</p><p>&ldquo;813,&rdquo; the name makes you wince &ldquo;Ihr Vorgesetzter hat eine Bitte.\u201d (your superior has a request.)</p><p>You wait for your mind to go blank, for the feeling of self-control to slip through your fingers, for you to respond back giving into the person in control. But you didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>&quot;S-say it again?&rdquo;</p><p>\u201c813,\u00a0Ihr Vorgesetzter hat eine Bitte.\u201d (813, your superior has a request.) Shuri repeats, nothing happens. The smile on your face is bright, and Shuri returns one to you</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, thank you Shuri.&rdquo; You wrap her in a tight hug, tears spill over your eyelids &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your gratitude would be returned if I could breathe.&rdquo; She struggled to speak, you immediately release her. &ldquo;We will still to have check in with you, make sure you don&rsquo;t suffer from delayed symptoms.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anything you want. I just can&rsquo;t believe this is real. How long was I out?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;About a week and a half, it&rsquo;s the fourth.&rdquo; Shuri told you &ldquo;I was going to let you out in two days on your birthday but-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The fourth is perfect.&rdquo; You tell her, gazing out the wide window, the world around you seeming brighter now &ldquo;It&rsquo;d be better if Steve were here though.&rdquo;</p><p>Shuri had a huge grin on her face. &ldquo;How would you like to see the royal study?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What so great about-&rdquo; you catch on to her, subtly tilting her head in the direction of the palace. Your heart pounds, and your feet can&rsquo;t move fast enough as you ran towards the nearest door.</p><p>You&rsquo;d have time to admire the city later, you say to yourself as you raced through the crowded streets, sights on the palace. Shuri must have warned them of your arrival because the guards say nothing to you when you approach them.</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the study?&rdquo; You ask one of them</p><p>&ldquo;Up the stairs, third door on your left.&rdquo;</p><p>You follow her orders, flying up the flight of stairs and down a long hall. Two Adora warriors stood on the other side of of the door. You recognized them from when you first arrived.</p><p>&ldquo;Is he in there?&rdquo; They smile and nod. You work to get yourself together, making sure your hair was neat enough and your clothes weren&rsquo;t disheveled, before signaling them to open the door.</p><p>He stood tall, as always, with his back to the door. Sam, Bucky and a blonde Natasha stood in front of him, their jaws drop when you stepped through the doors.</p><p>&ldquo;Damn Steve, you must&rsquo;ve been wishing really hard.&rdquo; Sam smirked</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; his voice makes your heart stop for just a second</p><p>&ldquo;Turn around and find out.&rdquo; You suppress a giggle when you see him tense up.</p><p>He turns and your heart aches when you see his bearded face and those clear blue eyes, his mouth goes slack, unable to form words.</p><p>&ldquo;Happy birthday Steve.&rdquo; You feel the stinging in your eyes again</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re back.&rdquo; He breathes out</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; You nod</p><p>&ldquo;C\u2019mhere.&rdquo; He holds his arms out and starts walking towards you. You don&rsquo;t waste another second and jump into his arms, wrapping your limbs around him tightly and crushing your lips to his.</p><hr><p><b>Taglist:</b> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-iVvkhd4YLTqOR2SIpqVlg\">@classybai</a> @moisoverennyi-thestarlessone\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg98wpEL3tngrHL8FJaO6kw\">@floralandspice</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcDGNwwA9qnFxuA0pZatDYw\">@bi-bi-bi-bisexualz</a> @theonelittleone <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgwqrPYAwPj17qDyMgsUUAg\">@grey-junior</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miyBwhXjuZfpKw4zsdw1Upg\">@marvelousbuckystark</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFQlPlwS-7Cvm32fzhdLoiQ\">@captainsthor</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7mE6GJSV6OmYVkD2XWFD7Q\">@sebbystanlover-vk</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mP0F9eNQuWfQQx7LbC9_4pg\">@jovialcalzonepaperzine</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEOOCvvzf-zM3f2LDbnnpTg\">@chook007</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0CrTu52PUYbln55U_wMWXg\">@dontchawishyouknewhowtosalsa</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-w-0Ao6CkSMl48Lxth1Gyw\">@geekysimmerthings</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdjpjaztHgKyH0S91WHEmiw\">@codename-buckybarnes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgsXmwaKfl143eO9PwYNyUg\">@marvelfansworld</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPTfd5Yh2Hk6oJwPsRkJMNw\">@emmaschhh</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGHjqbz4FlxwA4u9YhBgAHA\">@bruisedfaye</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mueBAfOVcANM1HR85GQWh2w\">@mackyk06</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTOPCjznxbJ6sltLkFkjjkw\">@teamcap4bucky</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYcV4AeN-qWr1tzMxcH8x0g\">@paigeem96</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrslhth473OtAh4Uk1hIyjg\">@lily-horvitz</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJiK0jy7SKilcfqiRfGLehw\">@tshollandlove</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfDW3iXFI-lSaGsSEZI3xFQ\">@nerdypisces160</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfBS0BI2T_apEQcN2Elg4vg\">@mrs-captain-evans</a> </p><p><b>New Taglist:</b> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maGXq6I3u6ntndOHA93lpFw\">@drakelover78</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms28-xzNkWU1LRvbd50eKKA\">@blackparacosm</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg5tdeFOGGykyTOOI7MHyUw\">@rororo06</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSHGlcjuPfVgEsEyA0ZbY1g\">@brownie8</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNRi12xGvXNi2RLa7t5eeBA\">@silverreading</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrDrJ5GjngevaDpeyPXcB9A\">@band&ndash;psycho</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIilgk5VayUO-CcwQ985Qtw\">@b-svendsen</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/maXXyJedKA2FM1BdWRdQH_g\">@buckybarnessexyseabass</a> @barneshollandx <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2vLIG1brMv5OnXy9D2zYcA\">@imlilyrodriguez</a> @dean-winchester-is-my-cherry-pie @skajl <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3vbYXibOi1oN7GlacgEvYw\">@all-things-marvel-related</a></p>",

For a moment you were confused until a woman, standing at the window with her back to you, began to speak.</p><p>\u201cMy lonely child, my beautiful girl.\u201d She turns to you and you see a nearly identical face to yours. Eyes and cheeks wet with tears. \u201cYou have grown into a gorgeous woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother?\u201d You choke out moving closer to her \u201cHow are you here? Have I died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you are just in a deep meditation.\u201d She meets you halfway</p><p>\u201cSo you are not truly here? Just my imagination playing games with me.\u201d</p><p>She reaches out and cups your cheeks. Her touch, despite standing by the open window, was warm. You place your hands on hers to keep her there a bit longer.</p><p>\u201cI am as real as I need to be.\u201d She looks over you once more</p><p>\u201cMother\u2026\u201d You fight through your tears \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>She pulls you in for a tight hug while you cry into her robes, stroking your hair and shushing you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you too.\u201d You holds you closer, tears falling from her face as well \u201cI should not have left you on your own, Rayna.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cI do not wish to talk about the past\u2026\u201d You pulled back to see her face \u201cWhat did you just call me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRayna, that was meant to be your name.\u201d She rubbed your cheeks again, wiping away newly spilled tears \u201cDarling you\u2019re cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe it\u2019s the shock.\u201d You give her a small smile \u201cIt\u2019s really you.

I didn\u2019t want you to forget that.\u201d She sighed \u201cI planned on telling your father once he returned from Vanaheim. We were going to find you on Midgard and bring you home, and get married. But-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fell ill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Odin all but banished my family from the palace.

Your eyes tell a story far more painful than a lost mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you could say that.\u201d You sigh \u201cI wasn\u2019t exactly brought up in a caring home.\u201d</p><p>For the first time, you tell your whole backstory. Being found by Hydra, conditioned to become an assassin and weapon. Finding Steve, finding Thor, Gainor and Cadence, even Odin. Up to meeting Shuri and getting your head settled. No one ever managed to get the full story out of you before, it\u2019s no surprise the first person would be your mother.</p><p>\u201cMy poor child.

You could feel yourself being pulled away, waking up even, a sofft tapping echoed in your ears. Only so much time left in this blissful state with your mother.</p><p>\u201cThink maybe if you never had me, or never met my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne should never dwell on what they believe are the regrets in their lives. You miss all the possibilities to come when you do. I do not regret you, for you are my gift to the world. All children are.\u201d Her voice starts to become distant</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose you again.\u201d You whisper</p><p>\u201cCarry my love with you, and I am never lost.

For a moment you were confused until a woman, standing at the window with her back to you, began to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;My lonely child, my beautiful girl.&rdquo; She turns to you and you see a nearly identical face to yours. Eyes and cheeks wet with tears. &ldquo;You have grown into a gorgeous woman.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mother?&rdquo; You choke out moving closer to her &ldquo;How are you here? Have I died?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, you are just in a deep meditation.&rdquo; She meets you halfway</p><p>&ldquo;So you are not truly here? Just my imagination playing games with me.&rdquo;</p><p>She reaches out and cups your cheeks. Her touch, despite standing by the open window, was warm. You place your hands on hers to keep her there a bit longer.</p><p>&ldquo;I am as real as I need to be.&rdquo; She looks over you once more</p><p>&ldquo;Mother&hellip;&rdquo; You fight through your tears &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed you.&rdquo;</p><p>She pulls you in for a tight hug while you cry into her robes, stroking your hair and shushing you.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed you too.&rdquo; You holds you closer, tears falling from her face as well &ldquo;I should not have left you on your own, Rayna.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do not wish to talk about the past&hellip;&rdquo; You pulled back to see her face &ldquo;What did you just call me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Rayna, that was meant to be your name.&rdquo; She rubbed your cheeks again, wiping away newly spilled tears &ldquo;Darling you&rsquo;re cold.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I believe it&rsquo;s the shock.&rdquo; You give her a small smile &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really you. I had so many questions, but now- I just-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; She kissed the top of your head &ldquo;Sometimes a hug says a thousand words.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why Rayna?&rdquo; You blurt out &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lovely name, but why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It means Queen, you <i>are</i> Thor&rsquo;s first born, and therefore rightfully in line for the throne of Asgard. I didn&rsquo;t want you to forget that.&rdquo; She sighed &ldquo;I planned on telling your father once he returned from Vanaheim. We were going to find you on Midgard and bring you home, and get married. But-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You fell ill.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And Odin all but banished my family from the palace. They couldn&rsquo;t reach your father.&rdquo; She gasps &ldquo;You have met your father haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s very protective of me. Nearly choked my boyfriend when he found out about us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A boyfriend?&rdquo; A wide joyful smile showed up on her face &ldquo;And you let me ramble on?&rdquo;</p><p>You shrug.&ldquo;I wanted to hear your voice.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I want to know about my daughter. Your eyes tell a story far more painful than a lost mother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose you could say that.&rdquo; You sigh &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t exactly brought up in a caring home.&rdquo;</p><p>For the first time, you tell your whole backstory. Being found by Hydra, conditioned to become an assassin and weapon. Finding Steve, finding Thor, Gainor and Cadence, even Odin. Up to meeting Shuri and getting your head settled. No one ever managed to get the full story out of you before, it&rsquo;s no surprise the first person would be your mother.</p><p>&ldquo;My poor child. I should&rsquo;ve never let you leave my arms.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m safe now. I have found my family.&rdquo; You squeezed her hand.</p><p>&ldquo;You have Steve.&rdquo; Your mother touches you face again &ldquo;You&rsquo;re beginning to warm up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you regret any of it?&rdquo; You rest your head on her shoulder, sitting on the chaise lounge and watching the peak of light rising over the mountains through the snow. You could feel yourself being pulled away, waking up even, a sofft tapping echoed in your ears. Only so much time left in this blissful state with your mother.</p><p>&ldquo;Think maybe if you never had me, or never met my father.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;One should never dwell on what they believe are the regrets in their lives. You miss all the possibilities to come when you do. I do not regret you, for you are my gift to the world. All children are.&rdquo; Her voice starts to become distant</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to lose you again.&rdquo; You whisper</p><p>&ldquo;Carry my love with you, and I am never lost. My beautiful Rayna.&rdquo;</p><p>* * *</p><p>You fell forward, being caught by two pairs of arms, gasping for air. Shuri places a hand to your back, grounding you.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re alright, everything is okay.&rdquo; She tells you</p><p>You begin to straighten up and scan over the room, it appears as if nothing changed besides the clothes they wore. It was hard to tell if anything truly happened.</p><p>&ldquo;How do you feel?&rdquo; Shuri asks</p><p>&ldquo;The same, I don&rsquo;t think it worked.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Only one way to truly know.&rdquo; She says knowingly</p><p>You frowned a bit but agree. &ldquo;Just be careful.&rdquo; You pulled away from the other scientist who held on to your arm to keep you from falling.</p><p>&ldquo;813,&rdquo; the name makes you wince &ldquo;Ihr Vorgesetzter hat eine Bitte.&rdquo; (your superior has a request.)</p><p>You wait for your mind to go blank, for the feeling of self-control to slip through your fingers, for you to respond back giving into the person in control. But you didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>\"S-say it again?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;813,&nbsp;Ihr Vorgesetzter hat eine Bitte.&rdquo; (813, your superior has a request.) Shuri repeats, nothing happens. The smile on your face is bright, and Shuri returns one to you</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, thank you Shuri.&rdquo; You wrap her in a tight hug, tears spill over your eyelids &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your gratitude would be returned if I could breathe.&rdquo; She struggled to speak, you immediately release her. &ldquo;We will still to have check in with you, make sure you don&rsquo;t suffer from delayed symptoms.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anything you want. I just can&rsquo;t believe this is real. How long was I out?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;About a week and a half, it&rsquo;s the fourth.&rdquo; Shuri told you &ldquo;I was going to let you out in two days on your birthday but-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The fourth is perfect.&rdquo; You tell her, gazing out the wide window, the world around you seeming brighter now &ldquo;It&rsquo;d be better if Steve were here though.&rdquo;</p><p>Shuri had a huge grin on her face. &ldquo;How would you like to see the royal study?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What so great about-&rdquo; you catch on to her, subtly tilting her head in the direction of the palace. Your heart pounds, and your feet can&rsquo;t move fast enough as you ran towards the nearest door.</p><p>You&rsquo;d have time to admire the city later, you say to yourself as you raced through the crowded streets, sights on the palace. Shuri must have warned them of your arrival because the guards say nothing to you when you approach them.</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the study?&rdquo; You ask one of them</p><p>&ldquo;Up the stairs, third door on your left.&rdquo;</p><p>You follow her orders, flying up the flight of stairs and down a long hall. Two Adora warriors stood on the other side of of the door. You recognized them from when you first arrived.</p><p>&ldquo;Is he in there?&rdquo; They smile and nod. You work to get yourself together, making sure your hair was neat enough and your clothes weren&rsquo;t disheveled, before signaling them to open the door.</p><p>He stood tall, as always, with his back to the door. Sam, Bucky and a blonde Natasha stood in front of him, their jaws drop when you stepped through the doors.</p><p>&ldquo;Damn Steve, you must&rsquo;ve been wishing really hard.&rdquo; Sam smirked</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; his voice makes your heart stop for just a second</p><p>&ldquo;Turn around and find out.&rdquo; You suppress a giggle when you see him tense up.</p><p>He turns and your heart aches when you see his bearded face and those clear blue eyes, his mouth goes slack, unable to form words.</p><p>&ldquo;Happy birthday Steve.&rdquo; You feel the stinging in your eyes again</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re back.&rdquo; He breathes out</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; You nod</p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mhere.&rdquo; He holds his arms out and starts walking towards you.
