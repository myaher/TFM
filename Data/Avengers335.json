He didn\u2019t even wake up a mess which was his typical protocol. To think he was halfway down the Happy Trail to not being in an absolute spiral of self-loathing and misery when this wizard came in and destroyed everything. For God\u2019s sake, he was planning to have a baby with his future wife!</p><p>\u00a0\u201cTony Stark, my name is Wong. You need to come with me,\u201d Wong announced himself as he stepped through his portal that flickered flames of white magic into Central Park where Tony and Pepper had been taking an early morning stroll, something so normal one second, and then&hellip;</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry, you giving out tickets to something?\u201d Tony taunted the sorcerer who remained vigilant.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWe need your help. I fear the fate of the Universe is at stake,\u201d Wong proceeded urgently.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWho\u2019s \u2018we?\u2019\u201d Tony scoffed, staring in disbelief as one of his best friends emerged from the portal, the man\u2019s eyes betraying an intensity of panic that Tony had never seen before. \u201cBruce?\u201d Tony coughed in surprise as Bruce crashed into Tony, gripping his shoulders to convey the complete loss he was at. \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Tony demanded from Wong who shook his head.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cDark times are upon us, Mr. Stark, and you are among one of the few people who may be able to stop it,\u201d Wong admitted, but Tony needed more than that to put on the suit and jump into action.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cLook, if that\u2019s all I\u2019ve got to go on, then the Dark Times are always upon us. Ever heard of Global Warming?\u201d Tony pegged Wong, but Bruce pulled back to look at Tony, tears brimming his eyes.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cTony\u2026it\u2019s so much worse than before,\u201d Bruce divulged. \u201cAnd (Y/N)\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWhat about (Y/N)?\u201d Tony prodded Bruce, his heart leaping into his throat at the mention of her name. \u201cIs she with you?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s got the Power Stone back,\u201d Bruce answered, shocking Tony. \u201cLoki gave it to her.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0Looking into Bruce\u2019s eyes, Tony felt the presence of an anxiety attack fill his belly like bugs desperately trying to escape from a jar, but the lid was shut tight. Tony turned to Pepper with steely eyes, a masked expression Pepper recognized and saw right through. He was in pain.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, honey, but I have to go,\u201d Tony choked out to Pepper who approached him with a worried expression and a knowing smile on her face.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re always sorry,\u201d Pepper sighed, placing her hand on Tony\u2019s chest. \u201cBut, this sounds serious. Besides, I expect you\u2019ll make it up to me.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cAnother giant stuffed rabbit?\u201d Tony attempted, smirking at her frown before kissing her cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll think of something.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure you will,\u201d Pepper acknowledged with a quick nod as she let Tony go, praying with every piece of herself that this was a quick fix. It almost never was, but she always hoped.</p><p>\u00a0Stepping through the portal, Tony was met with a load of Sci-Fi nonsense about Sakaar, Asgard, Thanos, and a whole fifth-grade-trip-to-the-planetarium-lecture on Infinity Stones that he wouldn\u2019t have believed had he not survived what he\u2019d survived so far, yet the words just wouldn\u2019t connect in his mind, especially considering most of his mind was taken up with one important question:</p><p>\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s great and all, and I plan to deal with that mess of words you just offered me once I can wrap my head around \u2018Devil\u2019s Anus,\u2019 but first\u2026I need to see (Y/N). Where is she?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cStephen is seeing her now,\u201d Wong answered ominously as Tony threw him a look.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cDoctor Stephen Strange, another sorcerer who apparently runs this place, is helping reconnect her \u2018spirit,\u2019 or something with the stone,\u201d Bruce explained as best he could to Tony who looked like a deer caught in headlights. \u201cI know, I tried to stop her, but\u2026it\u2019s (Y/N). She does what she wants.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cThat stubborn, little\u2026she knows better than that,\u201d Tony cursed, turning to Wong. \u201cHey, you! Yeah, any opinions on all this, Mortal Kombat?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve seen Stephen save Earth once before. I do not expect any less this time around.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cSo, he\u2019s done this before? That\u2019s where he was after he disappeared from his medical practice? Protecting Earth in this Hell Dimension?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cDark Dimension,\u201d Wong corrected. \u201cAnd, I suppose in simple terms, yes. He fought Dormammu to preserve Earth from his collection of planets by enforcing the use of the Time Stone.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201c\u2026it\u2019s like when we learned about Thor and Loki for the first time. Thought they would be the weirdest of it, but nope,\u201d Tony muttered to Bruce who nodded in stunned agreement. \u201cSo, how long has he been, you know, wizarding?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cLong enough,\u201d Wong defended his friend, but before Tony could comment, the entire Sanctum rumbled as if a thundercloud erupted directly beneath their feet, shaking pictures off the walls with crashes that paled in comparison to the far-off echo of a girl screaming in immense pain that sent Tony into a panic.</p><p>\u00a0It was (Y/N).</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Tony started out quietly, pacing the room in search of the source, then turned to Wong with rage in his eyes like flashing warning signs. \u201cWhere the hell is she?\u201d Tony shouted, charging the sorcerer. Bruce tried to calm him down, but he was inconsolable. \u201cShow her to me!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s in good hands,\u201d Wong promised. \u201cStephen must not be disturbed in the middle of his-\u201c</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn what we\u2019re interrupting. She\u2019s in pain and I\u2019m pissed off,\u201d Tony vouched as his Iron Man hand wrapped around his open palm that faced Wong, danger written across his reddened face. \u201cI\u2019m not asking again.\u201d Bruce might\u2019ve wanted to talk things out, but desperate times\u2026</p><p>\u00a0Taking a large surrendered huff, Wong\u2019s hands smashed into something mid-air that caused a ripple effect like a JARVIS hologram of some sort&hellip;but much more <i>Charmed </i>than Tony liked.</p><p>\u00a0Between the shattered glass, Tony could make out two figures that appeared to be doing some kind of s\u00e9ance, disappointingly without candles or a Ouija Board. Suddenly, there was a flash of purple light that sent both people tumbling to opposite sides of the room, but Tony immediately recognized the wild (Y/H/C) hair that belonged to the only person, besides Bruce and Pepper, that really understood him. His person. His person that he betrayed for reasons that didn\u2019t make sense to him anymore as he watched her examine her hands that were alight in amethyst magic that he\u2019d never seen on her before but was equally impressed by until he noticed how labored her breathing was&hellip;as if she was about to have another heart attack.</p><p>\u00a0Bolting through the portal without a second thought, Tony tried to approach (Y/N) by calling out her name, not sure how she was going to react to him.</p><p>\u00a0Her eyes immediately flickered up to his, but they weren\u2019t her eyes. They were projecting amethyst light like she was being possessed by something beyond Earth which only scared him further until she blinked out the light to focus on him, instantly boring holes into his skull as she made a fist that sizzled with vengeful magic.</p><p>\u00a0Yep, that was more like (Y/N).</p><p>\u00a0Tony smiled awkwardly, leaning against one of the pillars. \u201cSo, not too happy to see me again. Understandable, understandable&hellip;\u201d Tony trailed off as (Y/N)\u2019s eyes refused to cease in their intensity, making Tony swallow nervously, himself not very good at apologies. \u201cI know we had our differences, but you\u2019re not gonna try and kill me, right? Your best friend? The Ass in Iron Ass?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll try my best,\u201d (Y/N) snarled, her eyes still on him.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cTo not kill me, or&hellip;?\u201d Tony tried to joke, but his confidence staggered.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d (Y/N) deadpanned.</p><p>\u00a0The silence in the room was deafening until something tapped on the wood flooring with a thump. It was soft, but the sound reverberated against the walls with everyone\u2019s heavy breathing. It wouldn\u2019t have been noticed if Tony hadn\u2019t been staring directly at (Y/N)\u2019s face, tears rolling down her cheeks until her hair hid her agony, but Tony had already seen it.</p><p>\u00a0\u201c(Y/N)&hellip;I-I am so sorry&hellip;\u201d Strange struggled to begin as Tony remembered he was the one who did this to her. With anger coursing through his body, he took a step towards the broken wizard and opened his mouth to say something, but (Y/N) beat him to it.</p><p>\u201cYou should have warned me,\u201d (Y/N) croaked through her swollen throat, watching Strange\u2019s eyes brim with shocked tears from the floor across from her.</p><p>\u201cI-I didn\u2019t know that that was what the spell entailed. The Dark Dimension is&hellip;darker than I previously thought,\u201d Strange tried to explain, but (Y/N) was over it.</p><p>\u201cYou had no right to what you saw,\u201d she countered. Tony couldn\u2019t tell if it was rage or fear that was shaking her body, but he could tell she was moments from exploding.</p><p>\u201cWhen the book said you would face your worst fears, I had no idea they would be that detailed and that your fears would be\u2026forgive me, (Y/N). Are you alright-\u201c</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d (Y/N) screamed, backing away from Strange who tried to reach out to her, but in seconds she was up and running out of the room, dodging the crater in the staircase to get to the second floor of the building. Knowing she needed time to herself, Tony charged Strange instead.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d Tony demanded as Strange tried to pull himself together, wiping at his eyes.</p><p>\u201cMore than I should have. I don\u2019t understand how one person can have so much\u2026pain,\u201d Strange pieced together, his eyes shifting quickly in his head, dizzy from (Y/N)\u2019s nightmarish memories. He knew now that what had happened to his hands was entirely his fault, but (Y/N) \u2026she didn\u2019t deserve what had happened to her. Not by a long shot.</p><p>\u201cAnd you still shouldn\u2019t. Whatever you saw, it doesn\u2019t sound like you got her consent to see it. Pretty sure that\u2019s a crime somewhere over at Hogwarts,\u201d Tony retorted, nose-to-nose with Strange.</p><p>\u201cTony Stark\u2026what a <i>pleasure\u00a0</i>it is to finally meet you,\u201d Strange condescended, finally regaining his whit. Just because he was apologetic towards (Y/N) didn\u2019t mean that he was towards her friends.</p><p>\u201cYou as well, Doc. Came to complain about my lack of Acceptance letter in the mail as a kid, instead found you harassing my best friend. Care to explain yourself?\u201d Tony posited, leaning against the staircase banister, resisting the urge to look towards the second floor as Wong stepped forward with a tired look on his face.</p><p>\u201cI already explained to you that Stephen was helping (Y/N) to-\u201c</p><p>\u201cHelping?\u201d Tony scoffed at Wong. \u201cYou and I clearly have different definitions of helping someone, because that\u2026that was a scene straight out of Insidious if I\u2019ve ever seen it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInsidious?\u201d Wong puzzled, but Tony shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYeah, didn\u2019t think so,\u201d he muttered to himself as Bruce made himself known.</p><p>\u201cTony, I tried to stop her. I meant to find you before she went through with\u2026you know, what you just saw, but I wasn\u2019t convincing enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what exactly is it that I saw, Doctor?\u201d Tony pegged Strange who\u2019s face had become stone.</p><p>\u201cI did what I had to do,\u201d Strange swore. \u201cIt\u2019s best for her, and definitely best for what\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanos,\u201d Bruce finished for him. \u201cThe Other Guy fought him after we left Asgard, and Tony\u2026not even he was a match. Thanos threw Hulk around like a dog\u2019s chew toy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then, if Thanos needs all six stones, then why don\u2019t we stick this one down the garbage disposal?\u201d Tony attempted, pointing to the Time Stone around Strange\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cNo can do,\u201d Strange answered. \u201cWe swore to protect the Time Stone with our lives and now (Y/N), just as she had decided to do, has the burden of protecting the Power Stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that she can do that. She\u2019s been doing it for years, but\u2026you don\u2019t know her like we do,\u201d Tony argued, his own heart weighed down by what he now felt he could have prevented. \u201cShe deserves better than being hunted down by aliens 24/7. We got her away from that shit until you dragged her back into this Freak Show. I hope you find peace in that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t enjoy doing what I did, but it was the right call,\u201d Strange persisted. \u201cYou\u2019ll see soon enough if you can deflate that ego of yours for more than two seconds\u2026douchebag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll deflate mine when you deflate yours,\u201d Tony bit back, eyes leveled with Strange who glared back at him, letting the sexual tension\u2026I mean, just normal tension\u2026build.</p><p>\u201c\u2026seven million three hundred and two possibilities-\u201c</p><p>\u201cAKA the amount of times you\u2019ve granted someone\u2019s three wishes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAKA the amount of possibilities I\u2019ve foreseen in this future war we are to have with Thanos in which only one I\u2019ve seen us won\u2026and in that one I saw (Y/N) wielding the Power Stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd doing what with it?\u201d Tony asked, but Strange shook his head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s as far as my visions have taken me so far, but I plan to try and look further into the future once we end this useless banter we\u2019re in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been useless due to your lack of the fine details,\u201d Tony retorted coldly as he finally looked up to the second floor, his patience running out entirely as he looked towards Bruce. \u201cI have to go talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? It really didn\u2019t seem like she was in the mood for\u2026you,\u201d Bruce questioned nervously, but Tony brushed him off.</p><p>\u201cWell, that needs to change,\u201d Tony muttered, leaving out <i>because I won\u2019t be able to handle this chaotic situation otherwise. Not without her.</i></p><p><i> \u00a0</i>After evading the pit in the staircase, Tony found her hugging her knees next to the oversized window, chin digging into her right knee with her hand clutching her chest as her eyes and dried tears reflected the silver light outside. It was a position of defeat, of defense. She looked hollow.</p><p>Tony felt sick. This wasn\u2019t the way things were supposed to be. (Y/N) was his rock, his person.</p><p>The guilt was overwhelming, and he wasn\u2019t sure he was going to be able to fix this problem.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"324\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"barbara-wayne:wJ07on--BK14r2OkNBbJ2A:ZcI6zu2Yj2cGN\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/954533459e6365ff515c2e8a16422283/tumblr_p9x2h1w3Mj1rztagvo1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"324\"/></figure><p><b>(Y/N)\u2019S POV</b></p><p>She shouldn\u2019t be crying. She shouldn\u2019t be afraid of things that had already happened to her. Things she\u2019d convinced herself that she\u2019d gotten over. It was downright embarrassing after just been told she had to defend Earth from yet another Power Trip from space. As if she was some flawless hero-type that just lived to fight crime and have their face plastered on inspirational posters in school libraries. Like Steve. In fact, four years ago she was the one causing the crimes. Petty crimes, but still. When did this bullshit shift happen and how did she make it stop?</p><p><i> \u00a0</i>But after, what? Six days on no sleep and almost nothing to eat and have just been through a virtual reality game of Fucked Up Shit from My Past: Hoarder\u2019s Edition, she\u2019s bound to lose her mind. She couldn\u2019t think straight, much less stand up straight. She slid her back down the wall next to her new favorite aesthetically-pleasing, melodramatic window, gulping in breaths and pinching herself to keep from passing out. Staring towards the ominous sky, she damned whatever Universal Force was tricking her into this shit.</p><p>Not that it was all about her, but she felt convinced the joke was on her, and the punchline was just around the fucking corner. She just wasn\u2019t sure if she was ready for it this time.</p><p>She heard unsure footsteps climb the stairs after her a few minutes later, already knowing it was Tony. She knew it was useless to pull herself together. He\u2019d seen her do worse.</p><p>Eyes still out the window, she felt Tony sit across from her, his own eyes watching her carefully.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d Tony asked after a few moments, knowing she wouldn\u2019t answer him honestly, and instead of receiving a sarcastic response like he\u2019d hoped, she simply pulled her hand from her chest to wrap under her knees. She hadn\u2019t even known she\u2019d had her hand there, holding herself together from where she was ripped apart in her nightmare. As awful as it was to discover, it had become an automatic habit for her.</p><p>Tony sighed in the wake of her silence, deciding honestly was his best way to go. It was his only to get her to open up to him in the early days of their friendship, and if it ain\u2019t broke&hellip; \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to sleep,\u201d Tony admitted, receiving only radio static as he laughed humorlessly. \u201cAs if that\u2019s something new, I know. I know. But the reason I couldn\u2019t sleep was because I didn\u2019t know if you were alive\u2026\u201d Tony choked up, his eyes falling to his lap as (Y/N) blinked away a stray tear. Tony looked back up to her with another laugh, thinking of the cake that was sent to him, the same moment he knew she was okay. \u201cWell, not until I received your gift, \u2018you\u2019re tacky, and I hate you.\u2019 As always, your way with words has left me breathless, (Y/N)\u2026but I still couldn\u2019t sleep. There was always that voice in the back of my head and you know what it said to me? It kept telling me how wrong I was, and how right you were. That\u2019s not an easy thing to admit, but (Y/N)\u2026I mean it. Every word of it. Just please forgive me and when this is all over, come home. I don\u2019t care about the Accords just come-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou pushed us out,\u201d (Y/N) broke, her voice cracking with the effort. \u201cYou made us run. Made us criminals. And now, now when the Universe hangs in the fucking balance, now you apologize?\u201d (Y/N) demanded, silencing Tony immediately. She shook her head with tears in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo. I decided that the moment Rhodey hit the dirt,\u201d Tony answered darkly, his eyes trailing out the window as well in memory. \u201cAnd when I woke up to find you in the snow\u2026all I wanted was to save you\u2026but Steve took your body before I could fix\u2026\u201d Slowly, Tony pulled out (Y/N)\u2019s necklace from his pocket, the necklace he found under Steve\u2019s broken shield after the regretful fight in Siberia that almost took her life. The sapphire pendant caught (Y/N)\u2019s attention as it mingled with the light, casting a reflection on the window\u2019s glass. With trembling fingers, (Y/N) caressed the silver chain from Tony\u2019s hand, her mother\u2019s necklace, and pressed it to her lips as her body fell into Tony\u2019s arms that held her tight to his chest. Kissing the top of her head, he let her cry on him as she had allowed him to for so many years, quietly rocking her until her breathing became more stable.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cIf you want to talk about it\u2026\u201d Tony whispered as (Y/N) sniffed, letting Tony support her.</p><p>\u201cI was back under the knife\u2026under Hydra. It was like I was a little girl again\u2026alone and afraid. It felt like every bit of confidence I\u2019d built up had never existed. Like I was theirs for the taking\u2026which I guess I was. They did pay a hefty price for me,\u201d (Y/N) joked darkly as Tony rubbed her arm, but she shook herself off, wiping her eyes. \u201cBut like I said, the Universe hangs in the balance. We don\u2019t have time for my bullshit-\u201c</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not bullshit,\u201d Tony interrupted, but (Y/N) shook her head.</p><p>\u201cIt is. All that happened years ago, and I\u2019ve moved on, and\u2026and don\u2019t roll your eyes at me, I have,\u201d (Y/N) smacked Tony with a laugh, both knowing they were too fucked up beyond repair. \u201cWhatever. Besides\u2026I have to apologize to you, too-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo, you-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. I fought fire with fire. I should\u2019ve expected to get burned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd apparently I shouldn\u2019t have gone off my meds,\u201d Tony joked.</p><p>\u201cWe all make mistakes,\u201d (Y/N) shrugged, but was clearly still in deep pain. Tony recognized it, but also realized they were short on time and energy. \u201cHow much are you caught up on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much, but also not nearly enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect, we can work with that,\u201d (Y/N) retorted sarcastically as she made her way towards the stairs, but Tony stopped her one last time.</p><p>\u201cI just need to know what I&rsquo;m working with. Are you okay to handle this? Hey! No bullshit. Are you okay?\u201d Tony asked, leveling his eyes with hers, not letting her look away from him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d (Y/N) answered candidly, not even expecting her own answer. \u201cBut I don\u2019t really have a choice now, do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like it,\u201d Tony sighed sadly, then smiled at her. \u201cBut it does look like you\u2019ve got your fire back,\u201d Tony nodded as he held the amethyst locket that rested on (Y/N)\u2019s chest in a pendant similar to Strange\u2019s that intertwined with (Y/N)\u2019s mother\u2019s necklace. \u201cThings could be worse. At least this Thanos character doesn\u2019t have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd let\u2019s keep it way,\u201d (Y/N) smirked with a cock of her eyebrow, making Tony grin as they joined the new team downstairs in the foyer. Bruce paced nervously, flicking his eyes up to (Y/N) as he asked her a silent \u2018are you okay\u2019 that (Y/N) nodded to without a word as she looked towards Strange who seemed unsure of what to say, so she let him off the hook.</p><p>\u201cI know that you didn\u2019t mean for any of that to happen,\u201d (Y/N) assured him. \u201cYou just caught me off guard\u2026which isn\u2019t an easy thing to do, so I guess congratulations are in order, sir,\u201d (Y/N) saluted him as he rolled his eyes, allowing some of the tension to be relieved of the room. \u201cSo, Thanos. He\u2019s coming. He\u2019s evil. He\u2019s probably ugly. What the hell do we do about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBotox?\u201d Tony offered jokingly, but (Y/N) was quick.</p><p>\u201cMaybe later. I\u2019m waiting for my forties,\u201d (Y/N) responded immediately making everyone laugh. \u201cBut no, seriously. From a scientific standpoint, are Steve and I even going to age? You know, because of the super soldier serum. I swear that man hasn\u2019t earned a wrinkle since the day we first met,\u201d (Y/N) rambled as she walked around the room in deep thought. \u201cI mean, because I can\u2019t wait to age. Like, I can\u2019t wait to grow old with Steve and our highlight of the month is our weekly trip to Target, or Costco, or something. And we rent those little scooter/cart things, but not as jokes because we actually need them. But also as a joke because they\u2019re fucking hilarious. And then we get home and eat\u2026whatever old people eat, like vanilla wafers and pretzels all day and watch the sunset in our Tommy Bahama lawn chairs\u2026but we don\u2019t actually watch the sunset because we fall asleep at like four o\u2019clock in the afternoon. And like-\u201c</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, (Y/N)!\u201d Tony yelled out, trying to stop her as he leaned over a table in a chorus of laughter with Bruce, Wong, and Strange. \u201cWe get it. You\u2019re ready to get old. Shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. The point about Thanos, uh\u2026damn, where is the point and why can\u2019t I find it right now?\u201d (Y/N) mused out loud to herself, but Bruce helped her out.</p><p>\u201cThe point is, we have these stones. We know where they are. Vision is out there somewhere with the Mind Stone and we have to find him. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well that\u2019s the thing\u2026two weeks ago, Vision turned off his transponder,\u201d Tony answered. \u201cHe\u2019s offline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonder why,\u201d (Y/N) taunted darkly, then shook her head. \u201cNo, wait. He was on your side. Seriously, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found out about him and Wanda playing house somewhere in Scotland,\u201d Tony groaned. \u201cWhen I first designed Jarvis, I never thought he\u2019d become so\u2026evolved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw! I\u2019m so happy for them! Like a weird Bonnie and Clyde type of thing,\u201d (Y/N) gushed. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty fucking cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s illegal,\u201d Tony deadpanned, but (Y/N) was still smiling.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what makes it so cute. I approve. Not that my approval matters, but she\u2019ll get an earful when I find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, is anyone going to explain to me what the hell happened here while I was gone? Like the part where you almost killed her in Siberia? Care to explain that, Tony?\u201d Bruce shouted at Tony and (Y/N) who stared blankly at him, until Tony turned on (Y/N).</p><p>\u201cYou never told him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously, I told him the important bits,\u201d (Y/N) retorted darkly, making Tony narrow his eyes at her, then she threw her arms up. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have time! We were on a mission to kill Thor\u2019s sister in space! We had bigger fish to fry than trying to explain Ant Man. Plus, I got distracted by Valkryie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is Valkyrie?\u201d Tony exclaimed at (Y/N) who shot right back.</p><p>\u201cLook, all I\u2019m gonna say is that once I saw her fight, I wasn\u2019t sure I was straight anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you that sure to begin with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot since Rihanna, no, but I feel like we\u2019re getting off topic again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say?\u201d Strange spoke up sarcastically, rubbing his temples. \u201cIs this how your team always functions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it\u2019s how we always dysfunction,\u201d (Y/N) smirked as Bruce put his face in his hands.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what I\u2019ve been through over the years,\u201d Bruce moaned as Tony tried to high five (Y/N), but she walked right past him, suddenly becoming very stoic which killed the vibe of the room. \u201cBut for the past two years, I haven\u2019t been here so\u2026fill me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to know?\u201d Tony asked, and Bruce hesitated but nodded anyway. Tony launched into the Sokovia Accords and what went down in Lagos, Berlin, in the airport, in Siberia, going into detail where he could, but brushing over the pieces that still weren\u2019t resolved. (Y/N) chimed in for certain pieces, but remained quiet for most of the explanation, instead curiously roaming the room looking at the strange artifacts from who even knew where? Strange and Wong began to tell a bit of their own story with Dormammu, providing context for who everyone was becoming allies with until Tony mentioned becoming a father. The sound of metal pinging the ground interrupted the conversation where everyone looked to the back corner of the room to find a very sheepish looking (Y/N). Playing it cool, she \u201cinconspicuously\u201d walked over to a large planter where she tossed a small piece of whatever she broke inside, whistling towards the ceiling as she wrapped her hands behind her back and rocked on her heels.</p><p>\u201cOh, hey guys!\u201d (Y/N) laughed nervously as she noticed them all staring. \u201cI was just\u2026looking at the artifacts-\u201c</p><p>\u201c<i>Priceless </i>artifacts,\u201d Strange interjected, making (Y/N) even more sheepish.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026yeah, those priceless\u2026artifacts\u2026\u201d (Y/N) coughed awkwardly, then went back to the same desk to look inside the drawer past the knob she just broke.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)!\u201d Bruce chastised her as he shook his head, walking over to grab her by the arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat, it\u2019s already broken?\u201d (Y/N) complained in a situation that reminded Tony heavily of the good old days back in Stark Tower. It was frustrating to know that things might never go back to the way they were. He choked back a tear, keeping his face neutral as he snorted at her.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean breaking it more is the solution, punk,\u201d Tony teased her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I want to see what\u2019s inside! I want to be over there!\u201c (Y/N) yelled just as a vortex of black rimmed in purple light swallowed (Y/N) into the ground, making her appear a few terrifying seconds later over by the desk. Clearly, everyone was shook. Even Wong looked shook.</p><p>\u201c\u2026but I was\u2026and now I\u2019m\u2026\u201d (Y/N) muttered numbly, pointing from Bruce to where she was, then narrowed her eyes at Strange and Wong. \u201cAlright, which one of you fuckers did it?\u201d Strange and Wong just shook their heads in awe. \u201cNo? Neither of you decided to add this to your magic show?\u201d</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)\u2026I think that was the stone,\u201d Bruce pointed out, making (Y/N) look down to the after-glow of the Power Stone that was now settling on her chest again. With a smirk, (Y/N) lifted her chin high to address the men as she princess waved at them, blowing them sarcastic kisses. \u201cThank you, thank you! I\u2019ve officially surpassed all of you peasants with my greatness. You\u2019re welcome for allowing you all to witness my upgrade. Excuse me while I single-handedly go take down Thanos,\u201d (Y/N) joked as she made her way towards the door, but Bruce took her by the arm again.</p><p>\u201cNot just yet,\u201d Bruce laughed. \u201cWe still need to find Vision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, who could find him?\u201d Strange asked.</p><p>\u201c\u2026shit\u2026probably Steve Rogers,\u201d Tony replied, looking up to (Y/N) as Strange just about lost it.</p><p>\u201cFunny thing is, he was already here,\u201d (Y/N) sighed, making Tony cock his head. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s probably why Doctor Fancycape over there is losing his shit. Him, Sam, Scott, and I came here to escape, well\u2026you,\u201d (Y/N) choked as Tony looked at the floor in guilt. \u201cI told you, you and your government friends made us run pretty far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never meant for things to get so\u2026complicated,\u201d Tony shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Tony. Turns out life is complicated. I know, I\u2019m surprised too,\u201d (Y/N) retorted, quickly turning the dark conversation light. \u201cBut, not like in a good way. Like a, surprise! Happy birthday kind of way, but more of a, surprise! Your dog is dead, kind of way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou learn something new every day,\u201d Tony responded with a half-smile that didn\u2019t really reach his eyes. \u201cBut still, it\u2019s not that easy. Cap and I fell out hard. We\u2019re still not on speaking terms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, listen to me,\u201d Bruce cautioned as he approached Tony. \u201cThor\u2019s gone. Thanos is coming. It doesn\u2019t matter who you\u2019re talking to, or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right, Tony,\u201d (Y/N) chimed in, then shrugged. \u201cBesides, you already have half the power couple. What\u2019s one more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA whole power couple?\u201d Tony teased her.</p><p>\u201cHmm, math. I\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, not exactly the kind of math that I want to be doing. You, I can handle, but Spangles?\u201d Tony scratched the back of his neck. \u201cI almost caused the end for not one, but two of my best friend\u2019s lives and one of those happened to be his alter-ego. Couldn\u2019t be more different than him, yet more perfect\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that the speech you\u2019re gonna give at our wedding? Because it sucks,\u201d (Y/N) deadpanned.</p><p>\u201cWould you just let me\u2026\u201d Tony groaning, running a hand over his face as (Y/N) took a step back. \u201cI just don\u2019t know if I can face him after everything\u2026\u201d Tony let the statement hang in the air.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a way to contact Rogers, or not?\u201d Strange asked. \u201cBecause I can\u2019t seem to find him in any of the portals I cast. I can try a locating spell, but those will take a few days to-\u201c</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother,\u201d Tony interrupted as he sighed. After a moment of hesitation, he slipped the flip phone Steve sent him from his pocket. (Y/N) just stared at the little silver piece of the 90\u2019s and gawked, concealing the moment she almost dropped her jaw by clearing her throat.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, I refuse to get sentimental about that,\u201d (Y/N) stated into the silent room, making Tony smile at her awkwardness as she swallowed. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you still have that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the only way to contact you and Steve\u2026of course I still have it,\u201d Tony admitted.</p><p>\u201cStop it, alright?\u201d (Y/N) choked out, not masking her emotions as well as she would have liked which made Tony\u2019s heart inflate with hope. \u201cOr else I might actually forgive you. Which, then I would never forgive myself for being a pushover, which I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d Tony agreed as they held each other\u2019s eyes. (Y/N) rolled them to break the contact, crossing her arms across her chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still mad at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell? You gonna call him, or not?\u201d</p><p>Tony dropped his smile immediately, scrunching her eyebrows down at the phone as he opened up the only contact programmed into the device. The name projected from the screen like a voice demanding to be called. He\u2019d wanted to call for months now, but\u2026but the time never felt right. He always felt like even if he were to call, that he wouldn\u2019t know what to say. He knew he wanted to apologize to (Y/N), but it wasn\u2019t her phone. This was Steve. Completely different story. And he knew for a fact that Steve would always answer, but it wasn\u2019t really him that he wanted to talk to. He did, but it was always-</p><p>\u201cOh, for fuck\u2019s sake!\u201d (Y/N) yelled impatiently as she tried to grab the phone from Tony\u2019s grasp, but instead, the device clattered to the ground at their feet where they both dove for it.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)! Why do you keep breaking things?\u201d Tony shouted at her as they fought for control.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? This thing is more indestructible than your suits!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs upset as that makes me, you\u2019re probably right,\u201d Tony shrugged, but still held fast.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t we just discuss how I\u2019m always right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot always, just more often than I thought!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not wrong about this!\u201d (Y/N) groaned as she froze Tony\u2019s hand a bit in a little sting to make him let go. With a huff, (Y/N) smirked. \u201cLet\u2019s test this shall we?\u201d (Y/N) taunted as she prepared to stupidly throw the phone at the wall just to prove Tony wrong, but Bruce stole it from her instead, holding it just out of her reach as Tony was still hanging on her shoulder, reaching for the device. \u201cHey!\u201d (Y/N) called at Bruce, but he ignored her and went in to call Steve himself.</p><p>Suddenly, the air shifted. A dull hum droned above everyone\u2019s heads from the hole in the ceiling where Bruce came crashing to Earth. (Y/N) followed Tony\u2019s gaze to look at Strange who\u2019s fringe was twitching with the pulsating energy that tugged at everyone\u2019s guts like the push and pulls of the ocean tides.</p><p>\u201cSay, Doc. You wouldn\u2019t happen to be moving your hair, now would you?\u201d Tony asked Strange who watched his own wisp of hair dance ominously on his forehead.</p><p>\u201cNot at the moment, no,\u201d Strange answered as Tony and (Y/N) looked at each other, confirming each other\u2019s suspicions that something was about to happen with the fear in their eyes. Tony squeezed (Y/N)\u2019s shoulder to assure her as best he could as she began to walk towards the door, looking through the window to catch a glimpse of people rushing the streets in pure terror.</p><p>\u201cAll I have to say is, they messed with the wrong bitch at the wrong time,\u201d (Y/N) snarled as she shoved her way out into the streets, her hair getting swept up by the whirlwind that gusted through the canyon made by the towering buildings on each side of the street. The sky was barely visible through the ash and dust that was a low-hanging smog that made the city feel more and more unbearably claustrophobic by the second. Car horns were honking as traffic became a stand-still, people abandoning their vehicles to escape whatever was in the skies behind them, their terrified expressions peering over their shoulders like a horror movie come to life. (Y/N) heard her team attempting to help people on the streets, but she was determined to see what she was up against. She marched into the middle of the road, becoming mesmerized by the hollow spaceship that hovered above the smoke and grime like a Death Star donut. Struck by the ship, (Y/N) failed to notice the car hood that would\u2019ve sliced her own head off had Tony not tackled her to the ground, cradling her head in his arms as they went down.</p><p>Breaking from her trance, she looked up to Tony who looked just as relieved as she felt.</p><p>\u201cSuddenly, I\u2019m overcome with the feeling to forgive you,\u201d (Y/N) breathed out as Tony pulled her to her feet, each steadying the other.</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t do something stupid like that, and I won\u2019t have to save you again,\u201d Tony quipped, making (Y/N) push him off of her as they both ran around the street corner to where the ship was hovering over the dead-stop traffic like an apocalyptic wasteland where the dust storm was worse than ever. Strange stood beside (Y/N), gathering his magic to wisp aside most of the smog, but the view wasn\u2019t much better in the clear, finally getting the full frontal of the spaceship in all it\u2019s petrifying glory. \u201cFriday! Evac anyone south of 43<sup>rd\u00a0</sup>Street! Notify first responders!\u201d Tony called to Friday, but (Y/N) stepped out in front of him with her hands pulsating in a purple glow that sent chills through his body.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother,\u201d (Y/N) growled lowly to Tony and Strange, cracking her neck as her eyes glared daggers at the ship, the stone beginning to levitate off her chest. \u201cThey either find their way home, or they find themselves in a body bag. No more than ten blocks out, or they\u2019re dead. No more negotiations,\u201d (Y/N) asserted as she gritted her teeth, paving the way through the rubble towards the electric beam of blue light about a mile down the street, the light in her eyes demanding a war to not just be fought but to be won.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Taglist</b>: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYlu0CG6g0HV126mDX5EUAA\">@shannonr2003</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlSoQ-tzWXqmHBQjEOwnDYg\">@briannabloom</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muXrTh8-Cv3mjVDxjEs3Ktg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muXrTh8-Cv3mjVDxjEs3Ktg\">@ever-so-slightly-below-average</a></p><p>**Let me know if you want to be on the taglist (and yes, I will actually keep it up to date this time).

He didn\u2019t even wake up a mess which was his typical protocol. To think he was halfway down the Happy Trail to not being in an absolute spiral of self-loathing and misery when this wizard came in and destroyed everything. For God\u2019s sake, he was planning to have a baby with his future wife!</p><p>\u00a0\u201cTony Stark, my name is Wong. You need to come with me,\u201d Wong announced himself as he stepped through his portal that flickered flames of white magic into Central Park where Tony and Pepper had been taking an early morning stroll, something so normal one second, and then\u2026</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry, you giving out tickets to something?\u201d Tony taunted the sorcerer who remained vigilant.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWe need your help. I fear the fate of the Universe is at stake,\u201d Wong proceeded urgently.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWho\u2019s \u2018we?\u2019\u201d Tony scoffed, staring in disbelief as one of his best friends emerged from the portal, the man\u2019s eyes betraying an intensity of panic that Tony had never seen before. \u201cBruce?\u201d Tony coughed in surprise as Bruce crashed into Tony, gripping his shoulders to convey the complete loss he was at. \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Tony demanded from Wong who shook his head.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cDark times are upon us, Mr. Stark, and you are among one of the few people who may be able to stop it,\u201d Wong admitted, but Tony needed more than that to put on the suit and jump into action.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cLook, if that\u2019s all I\u2019ve got to go on, then the Dark Times are always upon us. Ever heard of Global Warming?\u201d Tony pegged Wong, but Bruce pulled back to look at Tony, tears brimming his eyes.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cTony\u2026it\u2019s so much worse than before,\u201d Bruce divulged. \u201cAnd (Y/N)\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWhat about (Y/N)?\u201d Tony prodded Bruce, his heart leaping into his throat at the mention of her name. \u201cIs she with you?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s got the Power Stone back,\u201d Bruce answered, shocking Tony. \u201cLoki gave it to her.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0Looking into Bruce\u2019s eyes, Tony felt the presence of an anxiety attack fill his belly like bugs desperately trying to escape from a jar, but the lid was shut tight. Tony turned to Pepper with steely eyes, a masked expression Pepper recognized and saw right through. He was in pain.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, honey, but I have to go,\u201d Tony choked out to Pepper who approached him with a worried expression and a knowing smile on her face.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re always sorry,\u201d Pepper sighed, placing her hand on Tony\u2019s chest. \u201cBut, this sounds serious. Besides, I expect you\u2019ll make it up to me.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cAnother giant stuffed rabbit?\u201d Tony attempted, smirking at her frown before kissing her cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll think of something.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure you will,\u201d Pepper acknowledged with a quick nod as she let Tony go, praying with every piece of herself that this was a quick fix. It almost never was, but she always hoped.</p><p>\u00a0Stepping through the portal, Tony was met with a load of Sci-Fi nonsense about Sakaar, Asgard, Thanos, and a whole fifth-grade-trip-to-the-planetarium-lecture on Infinity Stones that he wouldn\u2019t have believed had he not survived what he\u2019d survived so far, yet the words just wouldn\u2019t connect in his mind, especially considering most of his mind was taken up with one important question:</p><p>\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s great and all, and I plan to deal with that mess of words you just offered me once I can wrap my head around \u2018Devil\u2019s Anus,\u2019 but first\u2026I need to see (Y/N). Where is she?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cStephen is seeing her now,\u201d Wong answered ominously as Tony threw him a look.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cDoctor Stephen Strange, another sorcerer who apparently runs this place, is helping reconnect her \u2018spirit,\u2019 or something with the stone,\u201d Bruce explained as best he could to Tony who looked like a deer caught in headlights. \u201cI know, I tried to stop her, but\u2026it\u2019s (Y/N). She does what she wants.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cThat stubborn, little\u2026she knows better than that,\u201d Tony cursed, turning to Wong. \u201cHey, you! Yeah, any opinions on all this, Mortal Kombat?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve seen Stephen save Earth once before. I do not expect any less this time around.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cSo, he\u2019s done this before? That\u2019s where he was after he disappeared from his medical practice? Protecting Earth in this Hell Dimension?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cDark Dimension,\u201d Wong corrected. \u201cAnd, I suppose in simple terms, yes. He fought Dormammu to preserve Earth from his collection of planets by enforcing the use of the Time Stone.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201c\u2026it\u2019s like when we learned about Thor and Loki for the first time. Thought they would be the weirdest of it, but nope,\u201d Tony muttered to Bruce who nodded in stunned agreement. \u201cSo, how long has he been, you know, wizarding?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cLong enough,\u201d Wong defended his friend, but before Tony could comment, the entire Sanctum rumbled as if a thundercloud erupted directly beneath their feet, shaking pictures off the walls with crashes that paled in comparison to the far-off echo of a girl screaming in immense pain that sent Tony into a panic.</p><p>\u00a0It was (Y/N).</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Tony started out quietly, pacing the room in search of the source, then turned to Wong with rage in his eyes like flashing warning signs. \u201cWhere the hell is she?\u201d Tony shouted, charging the sorcerer. Bruce tried to calm him down, but he was inconsolable. \u201cShow her to me!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s in good hands,\u201d Wong promised. \u201cStephen must not be disturbed in the middle of his-\u201c</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn what we\u2019re interrupting. She\u2019s in pain and I\u2019m pissed off,\u201d Tony vouched as his Iron Man hand wrapped around his open palm that faced Wong, danger written across his reddened face. \u201cI\u2019m not asking again.\u201d Bruce might\u2019ve wanted to talk things out, but desperate times\u2026</p><p>\u00a0Taking a large surrendered huff, Wong\u2019s hands smashed into something mid-air that caused a ripple effect like a JARVIS hologram of some sort\u2026but much more <i>Charmed </i>than Tony liked.</p><p>\u00a0Between the shattered glass, Tony could make out two figures that appeared to be doing some kind of s\u00e9ance, disappointingly without candles or a Ouija Board. Suddenly, there was a flash of purple light that sent both people tumbling to opposite sides of the room, but Tony immediately recognized the wild (Y/H/C) hair that belonged to the only person, besides Bruce and Pepper, that really understood him. His person. His person that he betrayed for reasons that didn\u2019t make sense to him anymore as he watched her examine her hands that were alight in amethyst magic that he\u2019d never seen on her before but was equally impressed by until he noticed how labored her breathing was\u2026as if she was about to have another heart attack.</p><p>\u00a0Bolting through the portal without a second thought, Tony tried to approach (Y/N) by calling out her name, not sure how she was going to react to him.</p><p>\u00a0Her eyes immediately flickered up to his, but they weren\u2019t her eyes. They were projecting amethyst light like she was being possessed by something beyond Earth which only scared him further until she blinked out the light to focus on him, instantly boring holes into his skull as she made a fist that sizzled with vengeful magic.</p><p>\u00a0Yep, that was more like (Y/N).</p><p>\u00a0Tony smiled awkwardly, leaning against one of the pillars. \u201cSo, not too happy to see me again. Understandable, understandable\u2026\u201d Tony trailed off as (Y/N)\u2019s eyes refused to cease in their intensity, making Tony swallow nervously, himself not very good at apologies. \u201cI know we had our differences, but you\u2019re not gonna try and kill me, right? Your best friend? The Ass in Iron Ass?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll try my best,\u201d (Y/N) snarled, her eyes still on him.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cTo not kill me, or\u2026?\u201d Tony tried to joke, but his confidence staggered.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d (Y/N) deadpanned.</p><p>\u00a0The silence in the room was deafening until something tapped on the wood flooring with a thump. It was soft, but the sound reverberated against the walls with everyone\u2019s heavy breathing. It wouldn\u2019t have been noticed if Tony hadn\u2019t been staring directly at (Y/N)\u2019s face, tears rolling down her cheeks until her hair hid her agony, but Tony had already seen it.</p><p>\u00a0\u201c(Y/N)\u2026I-I am so sorry\u2026\u201d Strange struggled to begin as Tony remembered he was the one who did this to her. With anger coursing through his body, he took a step towards the broken wizard and opened his mouth to say something, but (Y/N) beat him to it.</p><p>\u201cYou should have warned me,\u201d (Y/N) croaked through her swollen throat, watching Strange\u2019s eyes brim with shocked tears from the floor across from her.</p><p>\u201cI-I didn\u2019t know that that was what the spell entailed. The Dark Dimension is\u2026darker than I previously thought,\u201d Strange tried to explain, but (Y/N) was over it.</p><p>\u201cYou had no right to what you saw,\u201d she countered. Tony couldn\u2019t tell if it was rage or fear that was shaking her body, but he could tell she was moments from exploding.</p><p>\u201cWhen the book said you would face your worst fears, I had no idea they would be that detailed and that your fears would be\u2026forgive me, (Y/N). Are you alright-\u201c</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d (Y/N) screamed, backing away from Strange who tried to reach out to her, but in seconds she was up and running out of the room, dodging the crater in the staircase to get to the second floor of the building. Knowing she needed time to herself, Tony charged Strange instead.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d Tony demanded as Strange tried to pull himself together, wiping at his eyes.</p><p>\u201cMore than I should have. I don\u2019t understand how one person can have so much\u2026pain,\u201d Strange pieced together, his eyes shifting quickly in his head, dizzy from (Y/N)\u2019s nightmarish memories. He knew now that what had happened to his hands was entirely his fault, but (Y/N) \u2026she didn\u2019t deserve what had happened to her. Not by a long shot.</p><p>\u201cAnd you still shouldn\u2019t. Whatever you saw, it doesn\u2019t sound like you got her consent to see it. Pretty sure that\u2019s a crime somewhere over at Hogwarts,\u201d Tony retorted, nose-to-nose with Strange.</p><p>\u201cTony Stark\u2026what a <i>pleasure\u00a0</i>it is to finally meet you,\u201d Strange condescended, finally regaining his whit. Just because he was apologetic towards (Y/N) didn\u2019t mean that he was towards her friends.</p><p>\u201cYou as well, Doc. Came to complain about my lack of Acceptance letter in the mail as a kid, instead found you harassing my best friend. Care to explain yourself?\u201d Tony posited, leaning against the staircase banister, resisting the urge to look towards the second floor as Wong stepped forward with a tired look on his face.</p><p>\u201cI already explained to you that Stephen was helping (Y/N) to-\u201c</p><p>\u201cHelping?\u201d Tony scoffed at Wong. \u201cYou and I clearly have different definitions of helping someone, because that\u2026that was a scene straight out of Insidious if I\u2019ve ever seen it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInsidious?\u201d Wong puzzled, but Tony shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYeah, didn\u2019t think so,\u201d he muttered to himself as Bruce made himself known.</p><p>\u201cTony, I tried to stop her. I meant to find you before she went through with\u2026you know, what you just saw, but I wasn\u2019t convincing enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what exactly is it that I saw, Doctor?\u201d Tony pegged Strange who\u2019s face had become stone.</p><p>\u201cI did what I had to do,\u201d Strange swore. \u201cIt\u2019s best for her, and definitely best for what\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanos,\u201d Bruce finished for him. \u201cThe Other Guy fought him after we left Asgard, and Tony\u2026not even he was a match. Thanos threw Hulk around like a dog\u2019s chew toy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then, if Thanos needs all six stones, then why don\u2019t we stick this one down the garbage disposal?\u201d Tony attempted, pointing to the Time Stone around Strange\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cNo can do,\u201d Strange answered. \u201cWe swore to protect the Time Stone with our lives and now (Y/N), just as she had decided to do, has the burden of protecting the Power Stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that she can do that. She\u2019s been doing it for years, but\u2026you don\u2019t know her like we do,\u201d Tony argued, his own heart weighed down by what he now felt he could have prevented. \u201cShe deserves better than being hunted down by aliens 24/7. We got her away from that shit until you dragged her back into this Freak Show. I hope you find peace in that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t enjoy doing what I did, but it was the right call,\u201d Strange persisted. \u201cYou\u2019ll see soon enough if you can deflate that ego of yours for more than two seconds\u2026douchebag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll deflate mine when you deflate yours,\u201d Tony bit back, eyes leveled with Strange who glared back at him, letting the sexual tension\u2026I mean, just normal tension\u2026build.</p><p>\u201c\u2026seven million three hundred and two possibilities-\u201c</p><p>\u201cAKA the amount of times you\u2019ve granted someone\u2019s three wishes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAKA the amount of possibilities I\u2019ve foreseen in this future war we are to have with Thanos in which only one I\u2019ve seen us won\u2026and in that one I saw (Y/N) wielding the Power Stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd doing what with it?\u201d Tony asked, but Strange shook his head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s as far as my visions have taken me so far, but I plan to try and look further into the future once we end this useless banter we\u2019re in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been useless due to your lack of the fine details,\u201d Tony retorted coldly as he finally looked up to the second floor, his patience running out entirely as he looked towards Bruce. \u201cI have to go talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? It really didn\u2019t seem like she was in the mood for\u2026you,\u201d Bruce questioned nervously, but Tony brushed him off.</p><p>\u201cWell, that needs to change,\u201d Tony muttered, leaving out <i>because I won\u2019t be able to handle this chaotic situation otherwise. Not without her.</i></p><p><i> \u00a0</i>After evading the pit in the staircase, Tony found her hugging her knees next to the oversized window, chin digging into her right knee with her hand clutching her chest as her eyes and dried tears reflected the silver light outside. It was a position of defeat, of defense. She looked hollow.</p><p>Tony felt sick. This wasn\u2019t the way things were supposed to be. (Y/N) was his rock, his person.</p><p>The guilt was overwhelming, and he wasn\u2019t sure he was going to be able to fix this problem.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"324\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"barbara-wayne:wJ07on--BK14r2OkNBbJ2A:ZcI6zu2Yj2cGN\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/954533459e6365ff515c2e8a16422283/tumblr_p9x2h1w3Mj1rztagvo1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"324\"></figure><p><b>(Y/N)\u2019S POV</b></p><p>She shouldn\u2019t be crying. She shouldn\u2019t be afraid of things that had already happened to her. Things she\u2019d convinced herself that she\u2019d gotten over. It was downright embarrassing after just been told she had to defend Earth from yet another Power Trip from space. As if she was some flawless hero-type that just lived to fight crime and have their face plastered on inspirational posters in school libraries. Like Steve. In fact, four years ago she was the one causing the crimes. Petty crimes, but still. When did this bullshit shift happen and how did she make it stop?</p><p><i> \u00a0</i>But after, what? Six days on no sleep and almost nothing to eat and have just been through a virtual reality game of Fucked Up Shit from My Past: Hoarder\u2019s Edition, she\u2019s bound to lose her mind. She couldn\u2019t think straight, much less stand up straight. She slid her back down the wall next to her new favorite aesthetically-pleasing, melodramatic window, gulping in breaths and pinching herself to keep from passing out. Staring towards the ominous sky, she damned whatever Universal Force was tricking her into this shit.</p><p>Not that it was all about her, but she felt convinced the joke was on her, and the punchline was just around the fucking corner. She just wasn\u2019t sure if she was ready for it this time.</p><p>She heard unsure footsteps climb the stairs after her a few minutes later, already knowing it was Tony. She knew it was useless to pull herself together. He\u2019d seen her do worse.</p><p>Eyes still out the window, she felt Tony sit across from her, his own eyes watching her carefully.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d Tony asked after a few moments, knowing she wouldn\u2019t answer him honestly, and instead of receiving a sarcastic response like he\u2019d hoped, she simply pulled her hand from her chest to wrap under her knees. She hadn\u2019t even known she\u2019d had her hand there, holding herself together from where she was ripped apart in her nightmare. As awful as it was to discover, it had become an automatic habit for her.</p><p>Tony sighed in the wake of her silence, deciding honestly was his best way to go. It was his only to get her to open up to him in the early days of their friendship, and if it ain\u2019t broke\u2026 \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to sleep,\u201d Tony admitted, receiving only radio static as he laughed humorlessly. \u201cAs if that\u2019s something new, I know. I know. But the reason I couldn\u2019t sleep was because I didn\u2019t know if you were alive\u2026\u201d Tony choked up, his eyes falling to his lap as (Y/N) blinked away a stray tear. Tony looked back up to her with another laugh, thinking of the cake that was sent to him, the same moment he knew she was okay. \u201cWell, not until I received your gift, \u2018you\u2019re tacky, and I hate you.\u2019 As always, your way with words has left me breathless, (Y/N)\u2026but I still couldn\u2019t sleep. There was always that voice in the back of my head and you know what it said to me? It kept telling me how wrong I was, and how right you were. That\u2019s not an easy thing to admit, but (Y/N)\u2026I mean it. Every word of it. Just please forgive me and when this is all over, come home. I don\u2019t care about the Accords just come-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou pushed us out,\u201d (Y/N) broke, her voice cracking with the effort. \u201cYou made us run. Made us criminals. And now, now when the Universe hangs in the fucking balance, now you apologize?\u201d (Y/N) demanded, silencing Tony immediately. She shook her head with tears in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo. I decided that the moment Rhodey hit the dirt,\u201d Tony answered darkly, his eyes trailing out the window as well in memory. \u201cAnd when I woke up to find you in the snow\u2026all I wanted was to save you\u2026but Steve took your body before I could fix\u2026\u201d Slowly, Tony pulled out (Y/N)\u2019s necklace from his pocket, the necklace he found under Steve\u2019s broken shield after the regretful fight in Siberia that almost took her life. The sapphire pendant caught (Y/N)\u2019s attention as it mingled with the light, casting a reflection on the window\u2019s glass. With trembling fingers, (Y/N) caressed the silver chain from Tony\u2019s hand, her mother\u2019s necklace, and pressed it to her lips as her body fell into Tony\u2019s arms that held her tight to his chest. Kissing the top of her head, he let her cry on him as she had allowed him to for so many years, quietly rocking her until her breathing became more stable.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cIf you want to talk about it\u2026\u201d Tony whispered as (Y/N) sniffed, letting Tony support her.</p><p>\u201cI was back under the knife\u2026under Hydra. It was like I was a little girl again\u2026alone and afraid. It felt like every bit of confidence I\u2019d built up had never existed. Like I was theirs for the taking\u2026which I guess I was. They did pay a hefty price for me,\u201d (Y/N) joked darkly as Tony rubbed her arm, but she shook herself off, wiping her eyes. \u201cBut like I said, the Universe hangs in the balance. We don\u2019t have time for my bullshit-\u201c</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not bullshit,\u201d Tony interrupted, but (Y/N) shook her head.</p><p>\u201cIt is. All that happened years ago, and I\u2019ve moved on, and\u2026and don\u2019t roll your eyes at me, I have,\u201d (Y/N) smacked Tony with a laugh, both knowing they were too fucked up beyond repair. \u201cWhatever. Besides\u2026I have to apologize to you, too-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo, you-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. I fought fire with fire. I should\u2019ve expected to get burned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd apparently I shouldn\u2019t have gone off my meds,\u201d Tony joked.</p><p>\u201cWe all make mistakes,\u201d (Y/N) shrugged, but was clearly still in deep pain. Tony recognized it, but also realized they were short on time and energy. \u201cHow much are you caught up on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much, but also not nearly enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect, we can work with that,\u201d (Y/N) retorted sarcastically as she made her way towards the stairs, but Tony stopped her one last time.</p><p>\u201cI just need to know what I\u2019m working with. Are you okay to handle this? Hey! No bullshit. Are you okay?\u201d Tony asked, leveling his eyes with hers, not letting her look away from him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d (Y/N) answered candidly, not even expecting her own answer. \u201cBut I don\u2019t really have a choice now, do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like it,\u201d Tony sighed sadly, then smiled at her. \u201cBut it does look like you\u2019ve got your fire back,\u201d Tony nodded as he held the amethyst locket that rested on (Y/N)\u2019s chest in a pendant similar to Strange\u2019s that intertwined with (Y/N)\u2019s mother\u2019s necklace. \u201cThings could be worse. At least this Thanos character doesn\u2019t have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd let\u2019s keep it way,\u201d (Y/N) smirked with a cock of her eyebrow, making Tony grin as they joined the new team downstairs in the foyer. Bruce paced nervously, flicking his eyes up to (Y/N) as he asked her a silent \u2018are you okay\u2019 that (Y/N) nodded to without a word as she looked towards Strange who seemed unsure of what to say, so she let him off the hook.</p><p>\u201cI know that you didn\u2019t mean for any of that to happen,\u201d (Y/N) assured him. \u201cYou just caught me off guard\u2026which isn\u2019t an easy thing to do, so I guess congratulations are in order, sir,\u201d (Y/N) saluted him as he rolled his eyes, allowing some of the tension to be relieved of the room. \u201cSo, Thanos. He\u2019s coming. He\u2019s evil. He\u2019s probably ugly. What the hell do we do about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBotox?\u201d Tony offered jokingly, but (Y/N) was quick.</p><p>\u201cMaybe later. I\u2019m waiting for my forties,\u201d (Y/N) responded immediately making everyone laugh. \u201cBut no, seriously. From a scientific standpoint, are Steve and I even going to age? You know, because of the super soldier serum. I swear that man hasn\u2019t earned a wrinkle since the day we first met,\u201d (Y/N) rambled as she walked around the room in deep thought. \u201cI mean, because I can\u2019t wait to age. Like, I can\u2019t wait to grow old with Steve and our highlight of the month is our weekly trip to Target, or Costco, or something. And we rent those little scooter/cart things, but not as jokes because we actually need them. But also as a joke because they\u2019re fucking hilarious. And then we get home and eat\u2026whatever old people eat, like vanilla wafers and pretzels all day and watch the sunset in our Tommy Bahama lawn chairs\u2026but we don\u2019t actually watch the sunset because we fall asleep at like four o\u2019clock in the afternoon. And like-\u201c</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, (Y/N)!\u201d Tony yelled out, trying to stop her as he leaned over a table in a chorus of laughter with Bruce, Wong, and Strange. \u201cWe get it. You\u2019re ready to get old. Shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. The point about Thanos, uh\u2026damn, where is the point and why can\u2019t I find it right now?\u201d (Y/N) mused out loud to herself, but Bruce helped her out.</p><p>\u201cThe point is, we have these stones. We know where they are. Vision is out there somewhere with the Mind Stone and we have to find him. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well that\u2019s the thing\u2026two weeks ago, Vision turned off his transponder,\u201d Tony answered. \u201cHe\u2019s offline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonder why,\u201d (Y/N) taunted darkly, then shook her head. \u201cNo, wait. He was on your side. Seriously, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found out about him and Wanda playing house somewhere in Scotland,\u201d Tony groaned. \u201cWhen I first designed Jarvis, I never thought he\u2019d become so\u2026evolved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw! I\u2019m so happy for them! Like a weird Bonnie and Clyde type of thing,\u201d (Y/N) gushed. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty fucking cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s illegal,\u201d Tony deadpanned, but (Y/N) was still smiling.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what makes it so cute. I approve. Not that my approval matters, but she\u2019ll get an earful when I find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, is anyone going to explain to me what the hell happened here while I was gone? Like the part where you almost killed her in Siberia? Care to explain that, Tony?\u201d Bruce shouted at Tony and (Y/N) who stared blankly at him, until Tony turned on (Y/N).</p><p>\u201cYou never told him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously, I told him the important bits,\u201d (Y/N) retorted darkly, making Tony narrow his eyes at her, then she threw her arms up. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have time! We were on a mission to kill Thor\u2019s sister in space! We had bigger fish to fry than trying to explain Ant Man. Plus, I got distracted by Valkryie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is Valkyrie?\u201d Tony exclaimed at (Y/N) who shot right back.</p><p>\u201cLook, all I\u2019m gonna say is that once I saw her fight, I wasn\u2019t sure I was straight anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you that sure to begin with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot since Rihanna, no, but I feel like we\u2019re getting off topic again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say?\u201d Strange spoke up sarcastically, rubbing his temples. \u201cIs this how your team always functions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it\u2019s how we always dysfunction,\u201d (Y/N) smirked as Bruce put his face in his hands.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what I\u2019ve been through over the years,\u201d Bruce moaned as Tony tried to high five (Y/N), but she walked right past him, suddenly becoming very stoic which killed the vibe of the room. \u201cBut for the past two years, I haven\u2019t been here so\u2026fill me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to know?\u201d Tony asked, and Bruce hesitated but nodded anyway. Tony launched into the Sokovia Accords and what went down in Lagos, Berlin, in the airport, in Siberia, going into detail where he could, but brushing over the pieces that still weren\u2019t resolved. (Y/N) chimed in for certain pieces, but remained quiet for most of the explanation, instead curiously roaming the room looking at the strange artifacts from who even knew where? Strange and Wong began to tell a bit of their own story with Dormammu, providing context for who everyone was becoming allies with until Tony mentioned becoming a father. The sound of metal pinging the ground interrupted the conversation where everyone looked to the back corner of the room to find a very sheepish looking (Y/N). Playing it cool, she \u201cinconspicuously\u201d walked over to a large planter where she tossed a small piece of whatever she broke inside, whistling towards the ceiling as she wrapped her hands behind her back and rocked on her heels.</p><p>\u201cOh, hey guys!\u201d (Y/N) laughed nervously as she noticed them all staring. \u201cI was just\u2026looking at the artifacts-\u201c</p><p>\u201c<i>Priceless </i>artifacts,\u201d Strange interjected, making (Y/N) even more sheepish.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026yeah, those priceless\u2026artifacts\u2026\u201d (Y/N) coughed awkwardly, then went back to the same desk to look inside the drawer past the knob she just broke.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)!\u201d Bruce chastised her as he shook his head, walking over to grab her by the arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat, it\u2019s already broken?\u201d (Y/N) complained in a situation that reminded Tony heavily of the good old days back in Stark Tower. It was frustrating to know that things might never go back to the way they were. He choked back a tear, keeping his face neutral as he snorted at her.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean breaking it more is the solution, punk,\u201d Tony teased her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I want to see what\u2019s inside! I want to be over there!\u201c (Y/N) yelled just as a vortex of black rimmed in purple light swallowed (Y/N) into the ground, making her appear a few terrifying seconds later over by the desk. Clearly, everyone was shook. Even Wong looked shook.</p><p>\u201c\u2026but I was\u2026and now I\u2019m\u2026\u201d (Y/N) muttered numbly, pointing from Bruce to where she was, then narrowed her eyes at Strange and Wong. \u201cAlright, which one of you fuckers did it?\u201d Strange and Wong just shook their heads in awe. \u201cNo? Neither of you decided to add this to your magic show?\u201d</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)\u2026I think that was the stone,\u201d Bruce pointed out, making (Y/N) look down to the after-glow of the Power Stone that was now settling on her chest again. With a smirk, (Y/N) lifted her chin high to address the men as she princess waved at them, blowing them sarcastic kisses. \u201cThank you, thank you! I\u2019ve officially surpassed all of you peasants with my greatness. You\u2019re welcome for allowing you all to witness my upgrade. Excuse me while I single-handedly go take down Thanos,\u201d (Y/N) joked as she made her way towards the door, but Bruce took her by the arm again.</p><p>\u201cNot just yet,\u201d Bruce laughed. \u201cWe still need to find Vision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, who could find him?\u201d Strange asked.</p><p>\u201c\u2026shit\u2026probably Steve Rogers,\u201d Tony replied, looking up to (Y/N) as Strange just about lost it.</p><p>\u201cFunny thing is, he was already here,\u201d (Y/N) sighed, making Tony cock his head. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s probably why Doctor Fancycape over there is losing his shit. Him, Sam, Scott, and I came here to escape, well\u2026you,\u201d (Y/N) choked as Tony looked at the floor in guilt. \u201cI told you, you and your government friends made us run pretty far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never meant for things to get so\u2026complicated,\u201d Tony shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Tony. Turns out life is complicated. I know, I\u2019m surprised too,\u201d (Y/N) retorted, quickly turning the dark conversation light. \u201cBut, not like in a good way. Like a, surprise! Happy birthday kind of way, but more of a, surprise! Your dog is dead, kind of way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou learn something new every day,\u201d Tony responded with a half-smile that didn\u2019t really reach his eyes. \u201cBut still, it\u2019s not that easy. Cap and I fell out hard. We\u2019re still not on speaking terms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, listen to me,\u201d Bruce cautioned as he approached Tony. \u201cThor\u2019s gone. Thanos is coming. It doesn\u2019t matter who you\u2019re talking to, or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right, Tony,\u201d (Y/N) chimed in, then shrugged. \u201cBesides, you already have half the power couple. What\u2019s one more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA whole power couple?\u201d Tony teased her.</p><p>\u201cHmm, math. I\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, not exactly the kind of math that I want to be doing. You, I can handle, but Spangles?\u201d Tony scratched the back of his neck. \u201cI almost caused the end for not one, but two of my best friend\u2019s lives and one of those happened to be his alter-ego. Couldn\u2019t be more different than him, yet more perfect\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that the speech you\u2019re gonna give at our wedding? Because it sucks,\u201d (Y/N) deadpanned.</p><p>\u201cWould you just let me\u2026\u201d Tony groaning, running a hand over his face as (Y/N) took a step back. \u201cI just don\u2019t know if I can face him after everything\u2026\u201d Tony let the statement hang in the air.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a way to contact Rogers, or not?\u201d Strange asked. \u201cBecause I can\u2019t seem to find him in any of the portals I cast. I can try a locating spell, but those will take a few days to-\u201c</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother,\u201d Tony interrupted as he sighed. After a moment of hesitation, he slipped the flip phone Steve sent him from his pocket. (Y/N) just stared at the little silver piece of the 90\u2019s and gawked, concealing the moment she almost dropped her jaw by clearing her throat.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, I refuse to get sentimental about that,\u201d (Y/N) stated into the silent room, making Tony smile at her awkwardness as she swallowed. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you still have that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the only way to contact you and Steve\u2026of course I still have it,\u201d Tony admitted.</p><p>\u201cStop it, alright?\u201d (Y/N) choked out, not masking her emotions as well as she would have liked which made Tony\u2019s heart inflate with hope. \u201cOr else I might actually forgive you. Which, then I would never forgive myself for being a pushover, which I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d Tony agreed as they held each other\u2019s eyes. (Y/N) rolled them to break the contact, crossing her arms across her chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still mad at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell? You gonna call him, or not?\u201d</p><p>Tony dropped his smile immediately, scrunching her eyebrows down at the phone as he opened up the only contact programmed into the device. The name projected from the screen like a voice demanding to be called. He\u2019d wanted to call for months now, but\u2026but the time never felt right. He always felt like even if he were to call, that he wouldn\u2019t know what to say. He knew he wanted to apologize to (Y/N), but it wasn\u2019t her phone. This was Steve. Completely different story. And he knew for a fact that Steve would always answer, but it wasn\u2019t really him that he wanted to talk to. He did, but it was always-</p><p>\u201cOh, for fuck\u2019s sake!\u201d (Y/N) yelled impatiently as she tried to grab the phone from Tony\u2019s grasp, but instead, the device clattered to the ground at their feet where they both dove for it.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)! Why do you keep breaking things?\u201d Tony shouted at her as they fought for control.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? This thing is more indestructible than your suits!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs upset as that makes me, you\u2019re probably right,\u201d Tony shrugged, but still held fast.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t we just discuss how I\u2019m always right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot always, just more often than I thought!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not wrong about this!\u201d (Y/N) groaned as she froze Tony\u2019s hand a bit in a little sting to make him let go. With a huff, (Y/N) smirked. \u201cLet\u2019s test this shall we?\u201d (Y/N) taunted as she prepared to stupidly throw the phone at the wall just to prove Tony wrong, but Bruce stole it from her instead, holding it just out of her reach as Tony was still hanging on her shoulder, reaching for the device. \u201cHey!\u201d (Y/N) called at Bruce, but he ignored her and went in to call Steve himself.</p><p>Suddenly, the air shifted. A dull hum droned above everyone\u2019s heads from the hole in the ceiling where Bruce came crashing to Earth. (Y/N) followed Tony\u2019s gaze to look at Strange who\u2019s fringe was twitching with the pulsating energy that tugged at everyone\u2019s guts like the push and pulls of the ocean tides.</p><p>\u201cSay, Doc. You wouldn\u2019t happen to be moving your hair, now would you?\u201d Tony asked Strange who watched his own wisp of hair dance ominously on his forehead.</p><p>\u201cNot at the moment, no,\u201d Strange answered as Tony and (Y/N) looked at each other, confirming each other\u2019s suspicions that something was about to happen with the fear in their eyes. Tony squeezed (Y/N)\u2019s shoulder to assure her as best he could as she began to walk towards the door, looking through the window to catch a glimpse of people rushing the streets in pure terror.</p><p>\u201cAll I have to say is, they messed with the wrong bitch at the wrong time,\u201d (Y/N) snarled as she shoved her way out into the streets, her hair getting swept up by the whirlwind that gusted through the canyon made by the towering buildings on each side of the street. The sky was barely visible through the ash and dust that was a low-hanging smog that made the city feel more and more unbearably claustrophobic by the second. Car horns were honking as traffic became a stand-still, people abandoning their vehicles to escape whatever was in the skies behind them, their terrified expressions peering over their shoulders like a horror movie come to life. (Y/N) heard her team attempting to help people on the streets, but she was determined to see what she was up against. She marched into the middle of the road, becoming mesmerized by the hollow spaceship that hovered above the smoke and grime like a Death Star donut. Struck by the ship, (Y/N) failed to notice the car hood that would\u2019ve sliced her own head off had Tony not tackled her to the ground, cradling her head in his arms as they went down.</p><p>Breaking from her trance, she looked up to Tony who looked just as relieved as she felt.</p><p>\u201cSuddenly, I\u2019m overcome with the feeling to forgive you,\u201d (Y/N) breathed out as Tony pulled her to her feet, each steadying the other.</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t do something stupid like that, and I won\u2019t have to save you again,\u201d Tony quipped, making (Y/N) push him off of her as they both ran around the street corner to where the ship was hovering over the dead-stop traffic like an apocalyptic wasteland where the dust storm was worse than ever. Strange stood beside (Y/N), gathering his magic to wisp aside most of the smog, but the view wasn\u2019t much better in the clear, finally getting the full frontal of the spaceship in all it\u2019s petrifying glory. \u201cFriday! Evac anyone south of 43<sup>rd\u00a0</sup>Street! Notify first responders!\u201d Tony called to Friday, but (Y/N) stepped out in front of him with her hands pulsating in a purple glow that sent chills through his body.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother,\u201d (Y/N) growled lowly to Tony and Strange, cracking her neck as her eyes glared daggers at the ship, the stone beginning to levitate off her chest. \u201cThey either find their way home, or they find themselves in a body bag. No more than ten blocks out, or they\u2019re dead. No more negotiations,\u201d (Y/N) asserted as she gritted her teeth, paving the way through the rubble towards the electric beam of blue light about a mile down the street, the light in her eyes demanding a war to not just be fought but to be won.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Taglist</b>: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYlu0CG6g0HV126mDX5EUAA\">@shannonr2003</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlSoQ-tzWXqmHBQjEOwnDYg\">@briannabloom</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muXrTh8-Cv3mjVDxjEs3Ktg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muXrTh8-Cv3mjVDxjEs3Ktg\">@ever-so-slightly-below-average</a></p><p>**Let me know if you want to be on the taglist (and yes, I will actually keep it up to date this time).

He didn\u2019t even wake up a mess which was his typical protocol. To think he was halfway down the Happy Trail to not being in an absolute spiral of self-loathing and misery when this wizard came in and destroyed everything. For God\u2019s sake, he was planning to have a baby with his future wife!</p><p>\u00a0\u201cTony Stark, my name is Wong. You need to come with me,\u201d Wong announced himself as he stepped through his portal that flickered flames of white magic into Central Park where Tony and Pepper had been taking an early morning stroll, something so normal one second, and then\u2026</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry, you giving out tickets to something?\u201d Tony taunted the sorcerer who remained vigilant.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWe need your help. I fear the fate of the Universe is at stake,\u201d Wong proceeded urgently.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWho\u2019s \u2018we?\u2019\u201d Tony scoffed, staring in disbelief as one of his best friends emerged from the portal, the man\u2019s eyes betraying an intensity of panic that Tony had never seen before. \u201cBruce?\u201d Tony coughed in surprise as Bruce crashed into Tony, gripping his shoulders to convey the complete loss he was at. \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Tony demanded from Wong who shook his head.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cDark times are upon us, Mr. Stark, and you are among one of the few people who may be able to stop it,\u201d Wong admitted, but Tony needed more than that to put on the suit and jump into action.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cLook, if that\u2019s all I\u2019ve got to go on, then the Dark Times are always upon us. Ever heard of Global Warming?\u201d Tony pegged Wong, but Bruce pulled back to look at Tony, tears brimming his eyes.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cTony\u2026it\u2019s so much worse than before,\u201d Bruce divulged. \u201cAnd (Y/N)\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWhat about (Y/N)?\u201d Tony prodded Bruce, his heart leaping into his throat at the mention of her name. \u201cIs she with you?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s got the Power Stone back,\u201d Bruce answered, shocking Tony. \u201cLoki gave it to her.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0Looking into Bruce\u2019s eyes, Tony felt the presence of an anxiety attack fill his belly like bugs desperately trying to escape from a jar, but the lid was shut tight. Tony turned to Pepper with steely eyes, a masked expression Pepper recognized and saw right through. He was in pain.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, honey, but I have to go,\u201d Tony choked out to Pepper who approached him with a worried expression and a knowing smile on her face.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re always sorry,\u201d Pepper sighed, placing her hand on Tony\u2019s chest. \u201cBut, this sounds serious. Besides, I expect you\u2019ll make it up to me.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cAnother giant stuffed rabbit?\u201d Tony attempted, smirking at her frown before kissing her cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll think of something.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure you will,\u201d Pepper acknowledged with a quick nod as she let Tony go, praying with every piece of herself that this was a quick fix. It almost never was, but she always hoped.</p><p>\u00a0Stepping through the portal, Tony was met with a load of Sci-Fi nonsense about Sakaar, Asgard, Thanos, and a whole fifth-grade-trip-to-the-planetarium-lecture on Infinity Stones that he wouldn\u2019t have believed had he not survived what he\u2019d survived so far, yet the words just wouldn\u2019t connect in his mind, especially considering most of his mind was taken up with one important question:</p><p>\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s great and all, and I plan to deal with that mess of words you just offered me once I can wrap my head around \u2018Devil\u2019s Anus,\u2019 but first\u2026I need to see (Y/N). Where is she?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cStephen is seeing her now,\u201d Wong answered ominously as Tony threw him a look.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cDoctor Stephen Strange, another sorcerer who apparently runs this place, is helping reconnect her \u2018spirit,\u2019 or something with the stone,\u201d Bruce explained as best he could to Tony who looked like a deer caught in headlights. \u201cI know, I tried to stop her, but\u2026it\u2019s (Y/N). She does what she wants.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cThat stubborn, little\u2026she knows better than that,\u201d Tony cursed, turning to Wong. \u201cHey, you! Yeah, any opinions on all this, Mortal Kombat?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve seen Stephen save Earth once before. I do not expect any less this time around.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cSo, he\u2019s done this before? That\u2019s where he was after he disappeared from his medical practice? Protecting Earth in this Hell Dimension?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cDark Dimension,\u201d Wong corrected. \u201cAnd, I suppose in simple terms, yes. He fought Dormammu to preserve Earth from his collection of planets by enforcing the use of the Time Stone.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201c\u2026it\u2019s like when we learned about Thor and Loki for the first time. Thought they would be the weirdest of it, but nope,\u201d Tony muttered to Bruce who nodded in stunned agreement. \u201cSo, how long has he been, you know, wizarding?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cLong enough,\u201d Wong defended his friend, but before Tony could comment, the entire Sanctum rumbled as if a thundercloud erupted directly beneath their feet, shaking pictures off the walls with crashes that paled in comparison to the far-off echo of a girl screaming in immense pain that sent Tony into a panic.</p><p>\u00a0It was (Y/N).</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Tony started out quietly, pacing the room in search of the source, then turned to Wong with rage in his eyes like flashing warning signs. \u201cWhere the hell is she?\u201d Tony shouted, charging the sorcerer. Bruce tried to calm him down, but he was inconsolable. \u201cShow her to me!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s in good hands,\u201d Wong promised. \u201cStephen must not be disturbed in the middle of his-\u201c</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn what we\u2019re interrupting. She\u2019s in pain and I\u2019m pissed off,\u201d Tony vouched as his Iron Man hand wrapped around his open palm that faced Wong, danger written across his reddened face. \u201cI\u2019m not asking again.\u201d Bruce might\u2019ve wanted to talk things out, but desperate times\u2026</p><p>\u00a0Taking a large surrendered huff, Wong\u2019s hands smashed into something mid-air that caused a ripple effect like a JARVIS hologram of some sort\u2026but much more <i>Charmed </i>than Tony liked.</p><p>\u00a0Between the shattered glass, Tony could make out two figures that appeared to be doing some kind of s\u00e9ance, disappointingly without candles or a Ouija Board. Suddenly, there was a flash of purple light that sent both people tumbling to opposite sides of the room, but Tony immediately recognized the wild (Y/H/C) hair that belonged to the only person, besides Bruce and Pepper, that really understood him. His person. His person that he betrayed for reasons that didn\u2019t make sense to him anymore as he watched her examine her hands that were alight in amethyst magic that he\u2019d never seen on her before but was equally impressed by until he noticed how labored her breathing was\u2026as if she was about to have another heart attack.</p><p>\u00a0Bolting through the portal without a second thought, Tony tried to approach (Y/N) by calling out her name, not sure how she was going to react to him.</p><p>\u00a0Her eyes immediately flickered up to his, but they weren\u2019t her eyes. They were projecting amethyst light like she was being possessed by something beyond Earth which only scared him further until she blinked out the light to focus on him, instantly boring holes into his skull as she made a fist that sizzled with vengeful magic.</p><p>\u00a0Yep, that was more like (Y/N).</p><p>\u00a0Tony smiled awkwardly, leaning against one of the pillars. \u201cSo, not too happy to see me again. Understandable, understandable\u2026\u201d Tony trailed off as (Y/N)\u2019s eyes refused to cease in their intensity, making Tony swallow nervously, himself not very good at apologies. \u201cI know we had our differences, but you\u2019re not gonna try and kill me, right? Your best friend? The Ass in Iron Ass?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll try my best,\u201d (Y/N) snarled, her eyes still on him.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cTo not kill me, or\u2026?\u201d Tony tried to joke, but his confidence staggered.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d (Y/N) deadpanned.</p><p>\u00a0The silence in the room was deafening until something tapped on the wood flooring with a thump. It was soft, but the sound reverberated against the walls with everyone\u2019s heavy breathing. It wouldn\u2019t have been noticed if Tony hadn\u2019t been staring directly at (Y/N)\u2019s face, tears rolling down her cheeks until her hair hid her agony, but Tony had already seen it.</p><p>\u00a0\u201c(Y/N)\u2026I-I am so sorry\u2026\u201d Strange struggled to begin as Tony remembered he was the one who did this to her. With anger coursing through his body, he took a step towards the broken wizard and opened his mouth to say something, but (Y/N) beat him to it.</p><p>\u201cYou should have warned me,\u201d (Y/N) croaked through her swollen throat, watching Strange\u2019s eyes brim with shocked tears from the floor across from her.</p><p>\u201cI-I didn\u2019t know that that was what the spell entailed. The Dark Dimension is\u2026darker than I previously thought,\u201d Strange tried to explain, but (Y/N) was over it.</p><p>\u201cYou had no right to what you saw,\u201d she countered. Tony couldn\u2019t tell if it was rage or fear that was shaking her body, but he could tell she was moments from exploding.</p><p>\u201cWhen the book said you would face your worst fears, I had no idea they would be that detailed and that your fears would be\u2026forgive me, (Y/N). Are you alright-\u201c</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d (Y/N) screamed, backing away from Strange who tried to reach out to her, but in seconds she was up and running out of the room, dodging the crater in the staircase to get to the second floor of the building. Knowing she needed time to herself, Tony charged Strange instead.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d Tony demanded as Strange tried to pull himself together, wiping at his eyes.</p><p>\u201cMore than I should have. I don\u2019t understand how one person can have so much\u2026pain,\u201d Strange pieced together, his eyes shifting quickly in his head, dizzy from (Y/N)\u2019s nightmarish memories. He knew now that what had happened to his hands was entirely his fault, but (Y/N) \u2026she didn\u2019t deserve what had happened to her. Not by a long shot.</p><p>\u201cAnd you still shouldn\u2019t. Whatever you saw, it doesn\u2019t sound like you got her consent to see it. Pretty sure that\u2019s a crime somewhere over at Hogwarts,\u201d Tony retorted, nose-to-nose with Strange.</p><p>\u201cTony Stark\u2026what a <i>pleasure\u00a0</i>it is to finally meet you,\u201d Strange condescended, finally regaining his whit. Just because he was apologetic towards (Y/N) didn\u2019t mean that he was towards her friends.</p><p>\u201cYou as well, Doc. Came to complain about my lack of Acceptance letter in the mail as a kid, instead found you harassing my best friend. Care to explain yourself?\u201d Tony posited, leaning against the staircase banister, resisting the urge to look towards the second floor as Wong stepped forward with a tired look on his face.</p><p>\u201cI already explained to you that Stephen was helping (Y/N) to-\u201c</p><p>\u201cHelping?\u201d Tony scoffed at Wong. \u201cYou and I clearly have different definitions of helping someone, because that\u2026that was a scene straight out of Insidious if I\u2019ve ever seen it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInsidious?\u201d Wong puzzled, but Tony shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYeah, didn\u2019t think so,\u201d he muttered to himself as Bruce made himself known.</p><p>\u201cTony, I tried to stop her. I meant to find you before she went through with\u2026you know, what you just saw, but I wasn\u2019t convincing enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what exactly is it that I saw, Doctor?\u201d Tony pegged Strange who\u2019s face had become stone.</p><p>\u201cI did what I had to do,\u201d Strange swore. \u201cIt\u2019s best for her, and definitely best for what\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanos,\u201d Bruce finished for him. \u201cThe Other Guy fought him after we left Asgard, and Tony\u2026not even he was a match. Thanos threw Hulk around like a dog\u2019s chew toy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then, if Thanos needs all six stones, then why don\u2019t we stick this one down the garbage disposal?\u201d Tony attempted, pointing to the Time Stone around Strange\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cNo can do,\u201d Strange answered. \u201cWe swore to protect the Time Stone with our lives and now (Y/N), just as she had decided to do, has the burden of protecting the Power Stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that she can do that. She\u2019s been doing it for years, but\u2026you don\u2019t know her like we do,\u201d Tony argued, his own heart weighed down by what he now felt he could have prevented. \u201cShe deserves better than being hunted down by aliens 24/7. We got her away from that shit until you dragged her back into this Freak Show. I hope you find peace in that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t enjoy doing what I did, but it was the right call,\u201d Strange persisted. \u201cYou\u2019ll see soon enough if you can deflate that ego of yours for more than two seconds\u2026douchebag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll deflate mine when you deflate yours,\u201d Tony bit back, eyes leveled with Strange who glared back at him, letting the sexual tension\u2026I mean, just normal tension\u2026build.</p><p>\u201c\u2026seven million three hundred and two possibilities-\u201c</p><p>\u201cAKA the amount of times you\u2019ve granted someone\u2019s three wishes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAKA the amount of possibilities I\u2019ve foreseen in this future war we are to have with Thanos in which only one I\u2019ve seen us won\u2026and in that one I saw (Y/N) wielding the Power Stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd doing what with it?\u201d Tony asked, but Strange shook his head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s as far as my visions have taken me so far, but I plan to try and look further into the future once we end this useless banter we\u2019re in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been useless due to your lack of the fine details,\u201d Tony retorted coldly as he finally looked up to the second floor, his patience running out entirely as he looked towards Bruce. \u201cI have to go talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? It really didn\u2019t seem like she was in the mood for\u2026you,\u201d Bruce questioned nervously, but Tony brushed him off.</p><p>\u201cWell, that needs to change,\u201d Tony muttered, leaving out <i>because I won\u2019t be able to handle this chaotic situation otherwise. Not without her.</i></p><p><i> \u00a0</i>After evading the pit in the staircase, Tony found her hugging her knees next to the oversized window, chin digging into her right knee with her hand clutching her chest as her eyes and dried tears reflected the silver light outside. It was a position of defeat, of defense. She looked hollow.</p><p>Tony felt sick. This wasn\u2019t the way things were supposed to be. (Y/N) was his rock, his person.</p><p>The guilt was overwhelming, and he wasn\u2019t sure he was going to be able to fix this problem.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"324\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"barbara-wayne:wJ07on--BK14r2OkNBbJ2A:ZcI6zu2Yj2cGN\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/954533459e6365ff515c2e8a16422283/tumblr_p9x2h1w3Mj1rztagvo1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"324\"></figure><p><b>(Y/N)\u2019S POV</b></p><p>She shouldn\u2019t be crying. She shouldn\u2019t be afraid of things that had already happened to her. Things she\u2019d convinced herself that she\u2019d gotten over. It was downright embarrassing after just been told she had to defend Earth from yet another Power Trip from space. As if she was some flawless hero-type that just lived to fight crime and have their face plastered on inspirational posters in school libraries. Like Steve. In fact, four years ago she was the one causing the crimes. Petty crimes, but still. When did this bullshit shift happen and how did she make it stop?</p><p><i> \u00a0</i>But after, what? Six days on no sleep and almost nothing to eat and have just been through a virtual reality game of Fucked Up Shit from My Past: Hoarder\u2019s Edition, she\u2019s bound to lose her mind. She couldn\u2019t think straight, much less stand up straight. She slid her back down the wall next to her new favorite aesthetically-pleasing, melodramatic window, gulping in breaths and pinching herself to keep from passing out. Staring towards the ominous sky, she damned whatever Universal Force was tricking her into this shit.</p><p>Not that it was all about her, but she felt convinced the joke was on her, and the punchline was just around the fucking corner. She just wasn\u2019t sure if she was ready for it this time.</p><p>She heard unsure footsteps climb the stairs after her a few minutes later, already knowing it was Tony. She knew it was useless to pull herself together. He\u2019d seen her do worse.</p><p>Eyes still out the window, she felt Tony sit across from her, his own eyes watching her carefully.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d Tony asked after a few moments, knowing she wouldn\u2019t answer him honestly, and instead of receiving a sarcastic response like he\u2019d hoped, she simply pulled her hand from her chest to wrap under her knees. She hadn\u2019t even known she\u2019d had her hand there, holding herself together from where she was ripped apart in her nightmare. As awful as it was to discover, it had become an automatic habit for her.</p><p>Tony sighed in the wake of her silence, deciding honestly was his best way to go. It was his only to get her to open up to him in the early days of their friendship, and if it ain\u2019t broke\u2026 \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to sleep,\u201d Tony admitted, receiving only radio static as he laughed humorlessly. \u201cAs if that\u2019s something new, I know. I know. But the reason I couldn\u2019t sleep was because I didn\u2019t know if you were alive\u2026\u201d Tony choked up, his eyes falling to his lap as (Y/N) blinked away a stray tear. Tony looked back up to her with another laugh, thinking of the cake that was sent to him, the same moment he knew she was okay. \u201cWell, not until I received your gift, \u2018you\u2019re tacky, and I hate you.\u2019 As always, your way with words has left me breathless, (Y/N)\u2026but I still couldn\u2019t sleep. There was always that voice in the back of my head and you know what it said to me? It kept telling me how wrong I was, and how right you were. That\u2019s not an easy thing to admit, but (Y/N)\u2026I mean it. Every word of it. Just please forgive me and when this is all over, come home. I don\u2019t care about the Accords just come-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou pushed us out,\u201d (Y/N) broke, her voice cracking with the effort. \u201cYou made us run. Made us criminals. And now, now when the Universe hangs in the fucking balance, now you apologize?\u201d (Y/N) demanded, silencing Tony immediately. She shook her head with tears in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo. I decided that the moment Rhodey hit the dirt,\u201d Tony answered darkly, his eyes trailing out the window as well in memory. \u201cAnd when I woke up to find you in the snow\u2026all I wanted was to save you\u2026but Steve took your body before I could fix\u2026\u201d Slowly, Tony pulled out (Y/N)\u2019s necklace from his pocket, the necklace he found under Steve\u2019s broken shield after the regretful fight in Siberia that almost took her life. The sapphire pendant caught (Y/N)\u2019s attention as it mingled with the light, casting a reflection on the window\u2019s glass. With trembling fingers, (Y/N) caressed the silver chain from Tony\u2019s hand, her mother\u2019s necklace, and pressed it to her lips as her body fell into Tony\u2019s arms that held her tight to his chest. Kissing the top of her head, he let her cry on him as she had allowed him to for so many years, quietly rocking her until her breathing became more stable.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cIf you want to talk about it\u2026\u201d Tony whispered as (Y/N) sniffed, letting Tony support her.</p><p>\u201cI was back under the knife\u2026under Hydra. It was like I was a little girl again\u2026alone and afraid. It felt like every bit of confidence I\u2019d built up had never existed. Like I was theirs for the taking\u2026which I guess I was. They did pay a hefty price for me,\u201d (Y/N) joked darkly as Tony rubbed her arm, but she shook herself off, wiping her eyes. \u201cBut like I said, the Universe hangs in the balance. We don\u2019t have time for my bullshit-\u201c</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not bullshit,\u201d Tony interrupted, but (Y/N) shook her head.</p><p>\u201cIt is. All that happened years ago, and I\u2019ve moved on, and\u2026and don\u2019t roll your eyes at me, I have,\u201d (Y/N) smacked Tony with a laugh, both knowing they were too fucked up beyond repair. \u201cWhatever. Besides\u2026I have to apologize to you, too-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo, you-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. I fought fire with fire. I should\u2019ve expected to get burned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd apparently I shouldn\u2019t have gone off my meds,\u201d Tony joked.</p><p>\u201cWe all make mistakes,\u201d (Y/N) shrugged, but was clearly still in deep pain. Tony recognized it, but also realized they were short on time and energy. \u201cHow much are you caught up on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much, but also not nearly enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect, we can work with that,\u201d (Y/N) retorted sarcastically as she made her way towards the stairs, but Tony stopped her one last time.</p><p>\u201cI just need to know what I\u2019m working with. Are you okay to handle this? Hey! No bullshit. Are you okay?\u201d Tony asked, leveling his eyes with hers, not letting her look away from him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d (Y/N) answered candidly, not even expecting her own answer. \u201cBut I don\u2019t really have a choice now, do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like it,\u201d Tony sighed sadly, then smiled at her. \u201cBut it does look like you\u2019ve got your fire back,\u201d Tony nodded as he held the amethyst locket that rested on (Y/N)\u2019s chest in a pendant similar to Strange\u2019s that intertwined with (Y/N)\u2019s mother\u2019s necklace. \u201cThings could be worse. At least this Thanos character doesn\u2019t have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd let\u2019s keep it way,\u201d (Y/N) smirked with a cock of her eyebrow, making Tony grin as they joined the new team downstairs in the foyer. Bruce paced nervously, flicking his eyes up to (Y/N) as he asked her a silent \u2018are you okay\u2019 that (Y/N) nodded to without a word as she looked towards Strange who seemed unsure of what to say, so she let him off the hook.</p><p>\u201cI know that you didn\u2019t mean for any of that to happen,\u201d (Y/N) assured him. \u201cYou just caught me off guard\u2026which isn\u2019t an easy thing to do, so I guess congratulations are in order, sir,\u201d (Y/N) saluted him as he rolled his eyes, allowing some of the tension to be relieved of the room. \u201cSo, Thanos. He\u2019s coming. He\u2019s evil. He\u2019s probably ugly. What the hell do we do about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBotox?\u201d Tony offered jokingly, but (Y/N) was quick.</p><p>\u201cMaybe later. I\u2019m waiting for my forties,\u201d (Y/N) responded immediately making everyone laugh. \u201cBut no, seriously. From a scientific standpoint, are Steve and I even going to age? You know, because of the super soldier serum. I swear that man hasn\u2019t earned a wrinkle since the day we first met,\u201d (Y/N) rambled as she walked around the room in deep thought. \u201cI mean, because I can\u2019t wait to age. Like, I can\u2019t wait to grow old with Steve and our highlight of the month is our weekly trip to Target, or Costco, or something. And we rent those little scooter/cart things, but not as jokes because we actually need them. But also as a joke because they\u2019re fucking hilarious. And then we get home and eat\u2026whatever old people eat, like vanilla wafers and pretzels all day and watch the sunset in our Tommy Bahama lawn chairs\u2026but we don\u2019t actually watch the sunset because we fall asleep at like four o\u2019clock in the afternoon. And like-\u201c</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, (Y/N)!\u201d Tony yelled out, trying to stop her as he leaned over a table in a chorus of laughter with Bruce, Wong, and Strange. \u201cWe get it. You\u2019re ready to get old. Shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. The point about Thanos, uh\u2026damn, where is the point and why can\u2019t I find it right now?\u201d (Y/N) mused out loud to herself, but Bruce helped her out.</p><p>\u201cThe point is, we have these stones. We know where they are. Vision is out there somewhere with the Mind Stone and we have to find him. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well that\u2019s the thing\u2026two weeks ago, Vision turned off his transponder,\u201d Tony answered. \u201cHe\u2019s offline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonder why,\u201d (Y/N) taunted darkly, then shook her head. \u201cNo, wait. He was on your side. Seriously, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found out about him and Wanda playing house somewhere in Scotland,\u201d Tony groaned. \u201cWhen I first designed Jarvis, I never thought he\u2019d become so\u2026evolved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw! I\u2019m so happy for them! Like a weird Bonnie and Clyde type of thing,\u201d (Y/N) gushed. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty fucking cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s illegal,\u201d Tony deadpanned, but (Y/N) was still smiling.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what makes it so cute. I approve. Not that my approval matters, but she\u2019ll get an earful when I find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, is anyone going to explain to me what the hell happened here while I was gone? Like the part where you almost killed her in Siberia? Care to explain that, Tony?\u201d Bruce shouted at Tony and (Y/N) who stared blankly at him, until Tony turned on (Y/N).</p><p>\u201cYou never told him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously, I told him the important bits,\u201d (Y/N) retorted darkly, making Tony narrow his eyes at her, then she threw her arms up. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have time! We were on a mission to kill Thor\u2019s sister in space! We had bigger fish to fry than trying to explain Ant Man. Plus, I got distracted by Valkryie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is Valkyrie?\u201d Tony exclaimed at (Y/N) who shot right back.</p><p>\u201cLook, all I\u2019m gonna say is that once I saw her fight, I wasn\u2019t sure I was straight anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you that sure to begin with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot since Rihanna, no, but I feel like we\u2019re getting off topic again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say?\u201d Strange spoke up sarcastically, rubbing his temples. \u201cIs this how your team always functions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it\u2019s how we always dysfunction,\u201d (Y/N) smirked as Bruce put his face in his hands.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what I\u2019ve been through over the years,\u201d Bruce moaned as Tony tried to high five (Y/N), but she walked right past him, suddenly becoming very stoic which killed the vibe of the room. \u201cBut for the past two years, I haven\u2019t been here so\u2026fill me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to know?\u201d Tony asked, and Bruce hesitated but nodded anyway. Tony launched into the Sokovia Accords and what went down in Lagos, Berlin, in the airport, in Siberia, going into detail where he could, but brushing over the pieces that still weren\u2019t resolved. (Y/N) chimed in for certain pieces, but remained quiet for most of the explanation, instead curiously roaming the room looking at the strange artifacts from who even knew where? Strange and Wong began to tell a bit of their own story with Dormammu, providing context for who everyone was becoming allies with until Tony mentioned becoming a father. The sound of metal pinging the ground interrupted the conversation where everyone looked to the back corner of the room to find a very sheepish looking (Y/N). Playing it cool, she \u201cinconspicuously\u201d walked over to a large planter where she tossed a small piece of whatever she broke inside, whistling towards the ceiling as she wrapped her hands behind her back and rocked on her heels.</p><p>\u201cOh, hey guys!\u201d (Y/N) laughed nervously as she noticed them all staring. \u201cI was just\u2026looking at the artifacts-\u201c</p><p>\u201c<i>Priceless </i>artifacts,\u201d Strange interjected, making (Y/N) even more sheepish.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026yeah, those priceless\u2026artifacts\u2026\u201d (Y/N) coughed awkwardly, then went back to the same desk to look inside the drawer past the knob she just broke.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)!\u201d Bruce chastised her as he shook his head, walking over to grab her by the arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat, it\u2019s already broken?\u201d (Y/N) complained in a situation that reminded Tony heavily of the good old days back in Stark Tower. It was frustrating to know that things might never go back to the way they were. He choked back a tear, keeping his face neutral as he snorted at her.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean breaking it more is the solution, punk,\u201d Tony teased her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I want to see what\u2019s inside! I want to be over there!\u201c (Y/N) yelled just as a vortex of black rimmed in purple light swallowed (Y/N) into the ground, making her appear a few terrifying seconds later over by the desk. Clearly, everyone was shook. Even Wong looked shook.</p><p>\u201c\u2026but I was\u2026and now I\u2019m\u2026\u201d (Y/N) muttered numbly, pointing from Bruce to where she was, then narrowed her eyes at Strange and Wong. \u201cAlright, which one of you fuckers did it?\u201d Strange and Wong just shook their heads in awe. \u201cNo? Neither of you decided to add this to your magic show?\u201d</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)\u2026I think that was the stone,\u201d Bruce pointed out, making (Y/N) look down to the after-glow of the Power Stone that was now settling on her chest again. With a smirk, (Y/N) lifted her chin high to address the men as she princess waved at them, blowing them sarcastic kisses. \u201cThank you, thank you! I\u2019ve officially surpassed all of you peasants with my greatness. You\u2019re welcome for allowing you all to witness my upgrade. Excuse me while I single-handedly go take down Thanos,\u201d (Y/N) joked as she made her way towards the door, but Bruce took her by the arm again.</p><p>\u201cNot just yet,\u201d Bruce laughed. \u201cWe still need to find Vision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, who could find him?\u201d Strange asked.</p><p>\u201c\u2026shit\u2026probably Steve Rogers,\u201d Tony replied, looking up to (Y/N) as Strange just about lost it.</p><p>\u201cFunny thing is, he was already here,\u201d (Y/N) sighed, making Tony cock his head. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s probably why Doctor Fancycape over there is losing his shit. Him, Sam, Scott, and I came here to escape, well\u2026you,\u201d (Y/N) choked as Tony looked at the floor in guilt. \u201cI told you, you and your government friends made us run pretty far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never meant for things to get so\u2026complicated,\u201d Tony shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Tony. Turns out life is complicated. I know, I\u2019m surprised too,\u201d (Y/N) retorted, quickly turning the dark conversation light. \u201cBut, not like in a good way. Like a, surprise! Happy birthday kind of way, but more of a, surprise! Your dog is dead, kind of way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou learn something new every day,\u201d Tony responded with a half-smile that didn\u2019t really reach his eyes. \u201cBut still, it\u2019s not that easy. Cap and I fell out hard. We\u2019re still not on speaking terms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, listen to me,\u201d Bruce cautioned as he approached Tony. \u201cThor\u2019s gone. Thanos is coming. It doesn\u2019t matter who you\u2019re talking to, or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right, Tony,\u201d (Y/N) chimed in, then shrugged. \u201cBesides, you already have half the power couple. What\u2019s one more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA whole power couple?\u201d Tony teased her.</p><p>\u201cHmm, math. I\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, not exactly the kind of math that I want to be doing. You, I can handle, but Spangles?\u201d Tony scratched the back of his neck. \u201cI almost caused the end for not one, but two of my best friend\u2019s lives and one of those happened to be his alter-ego. Couldn\u2019t be more different than him, yet more perfect\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that the speech you\u2019re gonna give at our wedding? Because it sucks,\u201d (Y/N) deadpanned.</p><p>\u201cWould you just let me\u2026\u201d Tony groaning, running a hand over his face as (Y/N) took a step back. \u201cI just don\u2019t know if I can face him after everything\u2026\u201d Tony let the statement hang in the air.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a way to contact Rogers, or not?\u201d Strange asked. \u201cBecause I can\u2019t seem to find him in any of the portals I cast. I can try a locating spell, but those will take a few days to-\u201c</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother,\u201d Tony interrupted as he sighed. After a moment of hesitation, he slipped the flip phone Steve sent him from his pocket. (Y/N) just stared at the little silver piece of the 90\u2019s and gawked, concealing the moment she almost dropped her jaw by clearing her throat.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, I refuse to get sentimental about that,\u201d (Y/N) stated into the silent room, making Tony smile at her awkwardness as she swallowed. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you still have that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the only way to contact you and Steve\u2026of course I still have it,\u201d Tony admitted.</p><p>\u201cStop it, alright?\u201d (Y/N) choked out, not masking her emotions as well as she would have liked which made Tony\u2019s heart inflate with hope. \u201cOr else I might actually forgive you. Which, then I would never forgive myself for being a pushover, which I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d Tony agreed as they held each other\u2019s eyes. (Y/N) rolled them to break the contact, crossing her arms across her chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still mad at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell? You gonna call him, or not?\u201d</p><p>Tony dropped his smile immediately, scrunching her eyebrows down at the phone as he opened up the only contact programmed into the device. The name projected from the screen like a voice demanding to be called. He\u2019d wanted to call for months now, but\u2026but the time never felt right. He always felt like even if he were to call, that he wouldn\u2019t know what to say. He knew he wanted to apologize to (Y/N), but it wasn\u2019t her phone. This was Steve. Completely different story. And he knew for a fact that Steve would always answer, but it wasn\u2019t really him that he wanted to talk to. He did, but it was always-</p><p>\u201cOh, for fuck\u2019s sake!\u201d (Y/N) yelled impatiently as she tried to grab the phone from Tony\u2019s grasp, but instead, the device clattered to the ground at their feet where they both dove for it.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)! Why do you keep breaking things?\u201d Tony shouted at her as they fought for control.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? This thing is more indestructible than your suits!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs upset as that makes me, you\u2019re probably right,\u201d Tony shrugged, but still held fast.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t we just discuss how I\u2019m always right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot always, just more often than I thought!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not wrong about this!\u201d (Y/N) groaned as she froze Tony\u2019s hand a bit in a little sting to make him let go. With a huff, (Y/N) smirked. \u201cLet\u2019s test this shall we?\u201d (Y/N) taunted as she prepared to stupidly throw the phone at the wall just to prove Tony wrong, but Bruce stole it from her instead, holding it just out of her reach as Tony was still hanging on her shoulder, reaching for the device. \u201cHey!\u201d (Y/N) called at Bruce, but he ignored her and went in to call Steve himself.</p><p>Suddenly, the air shifted. A dull hum droned above everyone\u2019s heads from the hole in the ceiling where Bruce came crashing to Earth. (Y/N) followed Tony\u2019s gaze to look at Strange who\u2019s fringe was twitching with the pulsating energy that tugged at everyone\u2019s guts like the push and pulls of the ocean tides.</p><p>\u201cSay, Doc. You wouldn\u2019t happen to be moving your hair, now would you?\u201d Tony asked Strange who watched his own wisp of hair dance ominously on his forehead.</p><p>\u201cNot at the moment, no,\u201d Strange answered as Tony and (Y/N) looked at each other, confirming each other\u2019s suspicions that something was about to happen with the fear in their eyes. Tony squeezed (Y/N)\u2019s shoulder to assure her as best he could as she began to walk towards the door, looking through the window to catch a glimpse of people rushing the streets in pure terror.</p><p>\u201cAll I have to say is, they messed with the wrong bitch at the wrong time,\u201d (Y/N) snarled as she shoved her way out into the streets, her hair getting swept up by the whirlwind that gusted through the canyon made by the towering buildings on each side of the street. The sky was barely visible through the ash and dust that was a low-hanging smog that made the city feel more and more unbearably claustrophobic by the second. Car horns were honking as traffic became a stand-still, people abandoning their vehicles to escape whatever was in the skies behind them, their terrified expressions peering over their shoulders like a horror movie come to life. (Y/N) heard her team attempting to help people on the streets, but she was determined to see what she was up against. She marched into the middle of the road, becoming mesmerized by the hollow spaceship that hovered above the smoke and grime like a Death Star donut. Struck by the ship, (Y/N) failed to notice the car hood that would\u2019ve sliced her own head off had Tony not tackled her to the ground, cradling her head in his arms as they went down.</p><p>Breaking from her trance, she looked up to Tony who looked just as relieved as she felt.</p><p>\u201cSuddenly, I\u2019m overcome with the feeling to forgive you,\u201d (Y/N) breathed out as Tony pulled her to her feet, each steadying the other.</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t do something stupid like that, and I won\u2019t have to save you again,\u201d Tony quipped, making (Y/N) push him off of her as they both ran around the street corner to where the ship was hovering over the dead-stop traffic like an apocalyptic wasteland where the dust storm was worse than ever. Strange stood beside (Y/N), gathering his magic to wisp aside most of the smog, but the view wasn\u2019t much better in the clear, finally getting the full frontal of the spaceship in all it\u2019s petrifying glory. \u201cFriday! Evac anyone south of 43<sup>rd\u00a0</sup>Street! Notify first responders!\u201d Tony called to Friday, but (Y/N) stepped out in front of him with her hands pulsating in a purple glow that sent chills through his body.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother,\u201d (Y/N) growled lowly to Tony and Strange, cracking her neck as her eyes glared daggers at the ship, the stone beginning to levitate off her chest. \u201cThey either find their way home, or they find themselves in a body bag. No more than ten blocks out, or they\u2019re dead. No more negotiations,\u201d (Y/N) asserted as she gritted her teeth, paving the way through the rubble towards the electric beam of blue light about a mile down the street, the light in her eyes demanding a war to not just be fought but to be won.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Taglist</b>: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYlu0CG6g0HV126mDX5EUAA\">@shannonr2003</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlSoQ-tzWXqmHBQjEOwnDYg\">@briannabloom</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muXrTh8-Cv3mjVDxjEs3Ktg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muXrTh8-Cv3mjVDxjEs3Ktg\">@ever-so-slightly-below-average</a></p><p>**Let me know if you want to be on the taglist (and yes, I will actually keep it up to date this time).

He didn&rsquo;t even wake up a mess which was his typical protocol. To think he was halfway down the Happy Trail to not being in an absolute spiral of self-loathing and misery when this wizard came in and destroyed everything. For God&rsquo;s sake, he was planning to have a baby with his future wife!</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Tony Stark, my name is Wong. You need to come with me,&rdquo; Wong announced himself as he stepped through his portal that flickered flames of white magic into Central Park where Tony and Pepper had been taking an early morning stroll, something so normal one second, and then&hellip;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, you giving out tickets to something?&rdquo; Tony taunted the sorcerer who remained vigilant.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;We need your help. I fear the fate of the Universe is at stake,&rdquo; Wong proceeded urgently.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s &lsquo;we?&rsquo;&rdquo; Tony scoffed, staring in disbelief as one of his best friends emerged from the portal, the man&rsquo;s eyes betraying an intensity of panic that Tony had never seen before. &ldquo;Bruce?&rdquo; Tony coughed in surprise as Bruce crashed into Tony, gripping his shoulders to convey the complete loss he was at. &ldquo;What the hell is going on?&rdquo; Tony demanded from Wong who shook his head.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Dark times are upon us, Mr. Stark, and you are among one of the few people who may be able to stop it,&rdquo; Wong admitted, but Tony needed more than that to put on the suit and jump into action.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Look, if that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got to go on, then the Dark Times are always upon us. Ever heard of Global Warming?&rdquo; Tony pegged Wong, but Bruce pulled back to look at Tony, tears brimming his eyes.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Tony&hellip;it&rsquo;s so much worse than before,&rdquo; Bruce divulged. &ldquo;And (Y/N)&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;What about (Y/N)?&rdquo; Tony prodded Bruce, his heart leaping into his throat at the mention of her name. &ldquo;Is she with you?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got the Power Stone back,&rdquo; Bruce answered, shocking Tony. &ldquo;Loki gave it to her.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Looking into Bruce&rsquo;s eyes, Tony felt the presence of an anxiety attack fill his belly like bugs desperately trying to escape from a jar, but the lid was shut tight. Tony turned to Pepper with steely eyes, a masked expression Pepper recognized and saw right through. He was in pain.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, honey, but I have to go,&rdquo; Tony choked out to Pepper who approached him with a worried expression and a knowing smile on her face.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re always sorry,&rdquo; Pepper sighed, placing her hand on Tony&rsquo;s chest. &ldquo;But, this sounds serious. Besides, I expect you&rsquo;ll make it up to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Another giant stuffed rabbit?&rdquo; Tony attempted, smirking at her frown before kissing her cheek. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think of something.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you will,&rdquo; Pepper acknowledged with a quick nod as she let Tony go, praying with every piece of herself that this was a quick fix. It almost never was, but she always hoped.</p><p>&nbsp;Stepping through the portal, Tony was met with a load of Sci-Fi nonsense about Sakaar, Asgard, Thanos, and a whole fifth-grade-trip-to-the-planetarium-lecture on Infinity Stones that he wouldn&rsquo;t have believed had he not survived what he&rsquo;d survived so far, yet the words just wouldn&rsquo;t connect in his mind, especially considering most of his mind was taken up with one important question:</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great and all, and I plan to deal with that mess of words you just offered me once I can wrap my head around &lsquo;Devil&rsquo;s Anus,&rsquo; but first&hellip;I need to see (Y/N). Where is she?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Stephen is seeing her now,&rdquo; Wong answered ominously as Tony threw him a look.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Doctor Stephen Strange, another sorcerer who apparently runs this place, is helping reconnect her &lsquo;spirit,&rsquo; or something with the stone,&rdquo; Bruce explained as best he could to Tony who looked like a deer caught in headlights. &ldquo;I know, I tried to stop her, but&hellip;it&rsquo;s (Y/N). She does what she wants.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;That stubborn, little&hellip;she knows better than that,&rdquo; Tony cursed, turning to Wong. &ldquo;Hey, you! Yeah, any opinions on all this, Mortal Kombat?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen Stephen save Earth once before. I do not expect any less this time around.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;So, he&rsquo;s done this before? That&rsquo;s where he was after he disappeared from his medical practice? Protecting Earth in this Hell Dimension?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Dark Dimension,&rdquo; Wong corrected. &ldquo;And, I suppose in simple terms, yes. He fought Dormammu to preserve Earth from his collection of planets by enforcing the use of the Time Stone.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;it&rsquo;s like when we learned about Thor and Loki for the first time. Thought they would be the weirdest of it, but nope,&rdquo; Tony muttered to Bruce who nodded in stunned agreement. &ldquo;So, how long has he been, you know, wizarding?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Long enough,&rdquo; Wong defended his friend, but before Tony could comment, the entire Sanctum rumbled as if a thundercloud erupted directly beneath their feet, shaking pictures off the walls with crashes that paled in comparison to the far-off echo of a girl screaming in immense pain that sent Tony into a panic.</p><p>&nbsp;It was (Y/N).</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; Tony started out quietly, pacing the room in search of the source, then turned to Wong with rage in his eyes like flashing warning signs. &ldquo;Where the hell is she?&rdquo; Tony shouted, charging the sorcerer. Bruce tried to calm him down, but he was inconsolable. &ldquo;Show her to me!&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in good hands,&rdquo; Wong promised. &ldquo;Stephen must not be disturbed in the middle of his-&ldquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give a damn what we&rsquo;re interrupting. She&rsquo;s in pain and I&rsquo;m pissed off,&rdquo; Tony vouched as his Iron Man hand wrapped around his open palm that faced Wong, danger written across his reddened face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not asking again.&rdquo; Bruce might&rsquo;ve wanted to talk things out, but desperate times&hellip;</p><p>&nbsp;Taking a large surrendered huff, Wong&rsquo;s hands smashed into something mid-air that caused a ripple effect like a JARVIS hologram of some sort&hellip;but much more <i>Charmed </i>than Tony liked.</p><p>&nbsp;Between the shattered glass, Tony could make out two figures that appeared to be doing some kind of s&eacute;ance, disappointingly without candles or a Ouija Board. Suddenly, there was a flash of purple light that sent both people tumbling to opposite sides of the room, but Tony immediately recognized the wild (Y/H/C) hair that belonged to the only person, besides Bruce and Pepper, that really understood him. His person. His person that he betrayed for reasons that didn&rsquo;t make sense to him anymore as he watched her examine her hands that were alight in amethyst magic that he&rsquo;d never seen on her before but was equally impressed by until he noticed how labored her breathing was&hellip;as if she was about to have another heart attack.</p><p>&nbsp;Bolting through the portal without a second thought, Tony tried to approach (Y/N) by calling out her name, not sure how she was going to react to him.</p><p>&nbsp;Her eyes immediately flickered up to his, but they weren&rsquo;t her eyes. They were projecting amethyst light like she was being possessed by something beyond Earth which only scared him further until she blinked out the light to focus on him, instantly boring holes into his skull as she made a fist that sizzled with vengeful magic.</p><p>&nbsp;Yep, that was more like (Y/N).</p><p>&nbsp;Tony smiled awkwardly, leaning against one of the pillars. &ldquo;So, not too happy to see me again. Understandable, understandable&hellip;&rdquo; Tony trailed off as (Y/N)&rsquo;s eyes refused to cease in their intensity, making Tony swallow nervously, himself not very good at apologies. &ldquo;I know we had our differences, but you&rsquo;re not gonna try and kill me, right? Your best friend? The Ass in Iron Ass?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try my best,&rdquo; (Y/N) snarled, her eyes still on him.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;To not kill me, or&hellip;?&rdquo; Tony tried to joke, but his confidence staggered.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; (Y/N) deadpanned.</p><p>&nbsp;The silence in the room was deafening until something tapped on the wood flooring with a thump. It was soft, but the sound reverberated against the walls with everyone&rsquo;s heavy breathing. It wouldn&rsquo;t have been noticed if Tony hadn&rsquo;t been staring directly at (Y/N)&rsquo;s face, tears rolling down her cheeks until her hair hid her agony, but Tony had already seen it.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;(Y/N)&hellip;I-I am so sorry&hellip;&rdquo; Strange struggled to begin as Tony remembered he was the one who did this to her. With anger coursing through his body, he took a step towards the broken wizard and opened his mouth to say something, but (Y/N) beat him to it.</p><p>&ldquo;You should have warned me,&rdquo; (Y/N) croaked through her swollen throat, watching Strange&rsquo;s eyes brim with shocked tears from the floor across from her.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I didn&rsquo;t know that that was what the spell entailed. The Dark Dimension is&hellip;darker than I previously thought,&rdquo; Strange tried to explain, but (Y/N) was over it.</p><p>&ldquo;You had no right to what you saw,&rdquo; she countered. Tony couldn&rsquo;t tell if it was rage or fear that was shaking her body, but he could tell she was moments from exploding.</p><p>&ldquo;When the book said you would face your worst fears, I had no idea they would be that detailed and that your fears would be&hellip;forgive me, (Y/N). Are you alright-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch me!&rdquo; (Y/N) screamed, backing away from Strange who tried to reach out to her, but in seconds she was up and running out of the room, dodging the crater in the staircase to get to the second floor of the building. Knowing she needed time to herself, Tony charged Strange instead.</p><p>&ldquo;What did you see?&rdquo; Tony demanded as Strange tried to pull himself together, wiping at his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;More than I should have. I don&rsquo;t understand how one person can have so much&hellip;pain,&rdquo; Strange pieced together, his eyes shifting quickly in his head, dizzy from (Y/N)&rsquo;s nightmarish memories. He knew now that what had happened to his hands was entirely his fault, but (Y/N) &hellip;she didn&rsquo;t deserve what had happened to her. Not by a long shot.</p><p>&ldquo;And you still shouldn&rsquo;t. Whatever you saw, it doesn&rsquo;t sound like you got her consent to see it. Pretty sure that&rsquo;s a crime somewhere over at Hogwarts,&rdquo; Tony retorted, nose-to-nose with Strange.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony Stark&hellip;what a <i>pleasure&nbsp;</i>it is to finally meet you,&rdquo; Strange condescended, finally regaining his whit. Just because he was apologetic towards (Y/N) didn&rsquo;t mean that he was towards her friends.</p><p>&ldquo;You as well, Doc. Came to complain about my lack of Acceptance letter in the mail as a kid, instead found you harassing my best friend. Care to explain yourself?&rdquo; Tony posited, leaning against the staircase banister, resisting the urge to look towards the second floor as Wong stepped forward with a tired look on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;I already explained to you that Stephen was helping (Y/N) to-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Helping?&rdquo; Tony scoffed at Wong. &ldquo;You and I clearly have different definitions of helping someone, because that&hellip;that was a scene straight out of Insidious if I&rsquo;ve ever seen it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Insidious?&rdquo; Wong puzzled, but Tony shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, didn&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; he muttered to himself as Bruce made himself known.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony, I tried to stop her. I meant to find you before she went through with&hellip;you know, what you just saw, but I wasn&rsquo;t convincing enough.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what exactly is it that I saw, Doctor?&rdquo; Tony pegged Strange who&rsquo;s face had become stone.</p><p>&ldquo;I did what I had to do,&rdquo; Strange swore. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s best for her, and definitely best for what&rsquo;s coming.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanos,&rdquo; Bruce finished for him. &ldquo;The Other Guy fought him after we left Asgard, and Tony&hellip;not even he was a match. Thanos threw Hulk around like a dog&rsquo;s chew toy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well then, if Thanos needs all six stones, then why don&rsquo;t we stick this one down the garbage disposal?&rdquo; Tony attempted, pointing to the Time Stone around Strange&rsquo;s neck.</p><p>&ldquo;No can do,&rdquo; Strange answered. &ldquo;We swore to protect the Time Stone with our lives and now (Y/N), just as she had decided to do, has the burden of protecting the Power Stone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt that she can do that. She&rsquo;s been doing it for years, but&hellip;you don&rsquo;t know her like we do,&rdquo; Tony argued, his own heart weighed down by what he now felt he could have prevented. &ldquo;She deserves better than being hunted down by aliens 24/7. We got her away from that shit until you dragged her back into this Freak Show. I hope you find peace in that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t enjoy doing what I did, but it was the right call,&rdquo; Strange persisted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see soon enough if you can deflate that ego of yours for more than two seconds&hellip;douchebag.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll deflate mine when you deflate yours,&rdquo; Tony bit back, eyes leveled with Strange who glared back at him, letting the sexual tension&hellip;I mean, just normal tension&hellip;build.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;seven million three hundred and two possibilities-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;AKA the amount of times you&rsquo;ve granted someone&rsquo;s three wishes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;AKA the amount of possibilities I&rsquo;ve foreseen in this future war we are to have with Thanos in which only one I&rsquo;ve seen us won&hellip;and in that one I saw (Y/N) wielding the Power Stone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And doing what with it?&rdquo; Tony asked, but Strange shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as far as my visions have taken me so far, but I plan to try and look further into the future once we end this useless banter we&rsquo;re in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only been useless due to your lack of the fine details,&rdquo; Tony retorted coldly as he finally looked up to the second floor, his patience running out entirely as he looked towards Bruce. &ldquo;I have to go talk to her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure? It really didn&rsquo;t seem like she was in the mood for&hellip;you,&rdquo; Bruce questioned nervously, but Tony brushed him off.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, that needs to change,&rdquo; Tony muttered, leaving out <i>because I won&rsquo;t be able to handle this chaotic situation otherwise. Not without her.</i></p><p><i> &nbsp;</i>After evading the pit in the staircase, Tony found her hugging her knees next to the oversized window, chin digging into her right knee with her hand clutching her chest as her eyes and dried tears reflected the silver light outside. It was a position of defeat, of defense. She looked hollow.</p><p>Tony felt sick. This wasn&rsquo;t the way things were supposed to be. (Y/N) was his rock, his person.</p><p>The guilt was overwhelming, and he wasn&rsquo;t sure he was going to be able to fix this problem.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"1\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><b>(Y/N)&rsquo;S POV</b></p><p>She shouldn&rsquo;t be crying. She shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid of things that had already happened to her. Things she&rsquo;d convinced herself that she&rsquo;d gotten over. It was downright embarrassing after just been told she had to defend Earth from yet another Power Trip from space. As if she was some flawless hero-type that just lived to fight crime and have their face plastered on inspirational posters in school libraries. Like Steve. In fact, four years ago she was the one causing the crimes. Petty crimes, but still. When did this bullshit shift happen and how did she make it stop?</p><p><i> &nbsp;</i>But after, what? Six days on no sleep and almost nothing to eat and have just been through a virtual reality game of Fucked Up Shit from My Past: Hoarder&rsquo;s Edition, she&rsquo;s bound to lose her mind. She couldn&rsquo;t think straight, much less stand up straight. She slid her back down the wall next to her new favorite aesthetically-pleasing, melodramatic window, gulping in breaths and pinching herself to keep from passing out. Staring towards the ominous sky, she damned whatever Universal Force was tricking her into this shit.</p><p>Not that it was all about her, but she felt convinced the joke was on her, and the punchline was just around the fucking corner. She just wasn&rsquo;t sure if she was ready for it this time.</p><p>She heard unsure footsteps climb the stairs after her a few minutes later, already knowing it was Tony. She knew it was useless to pull herself together. He&rsquo;d seen her do worse.</p><p>Eyes still out the window, she felt Tony sit across from her, his own eyes watching her carefully.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; Tony asked after a few moments, knowing she wouldn&rsquo;t answer him honestly, and instead of receiving a sarcastic response like he&rsquo;d hoped, she simply pulled her hand from her chest to wrap under her knees. She hadn&rsquo;t even known she&rsquo;d had her hand there, holding herself together from where she was ripped apart in her nightmare. As awful as it was to discover, it had become an automatic habit for her.</p><p>Tony sighed in the wake of her silence, deciding honestly was his best way to go. It was his only to get her to open up to him in the early days of their friendship, and if it ain&rsquo;t broke&hellip; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been able to sleep,&rdquo; Tony admitted, receiving only radio static as he laughed humorlessly. &ldquo;As if that&rsquo;s something new, I know. I know. But the reason I couldn&rsquo;t sleep was because I didn&rsquo;t know if you were alive&hellip;&rdquo; Tony choked up, his eyes falling to his lap as (Y/N) blinked away a stray tear. Tony looked back up to her with another laugh, thinking of the cake that was sent to him, the same moment he knew she was okay. &ldquo;Well, not until I received your gift, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re tacky, and I hate you.&rsquo; As always, your way with words has left me breathless, (Y/N)&hellip;but I still couldn&rsquo;t sleep. There was always that voice in the back of my head and you know what it said to me? It kept telling me how wrong I was, and how right you were. That&rsquo;s not an easy thing to admit, but (Y/N)&hellip;I mean it. Every word of it. Just please forgive me and when this is all over, come home. I don&rsquo;t care about the Accords just come-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You pushed us out,&rdquo; (Y/N) broke, her voice cracking with the effort. &ldquo;You made us run. Made us criminals. And now, now when the Universe hangs in the fucking balance, now you apologize?&rdquo; (Y/N) demanded, silencing Tony immediately. She shook her head with tears in her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;No. I decided that the moment Rhodey hit the dirt,&rdquo; Tony answered darkly, his eyes trailing out the window as well in memory. &ldquo;And when I woke up to find you in the snow&hellip;all I wanted was to save you&hellip;but Steve took your body before I could fix&hellip;&rdquo; Slowly, Tony pulled out (Y/N)&rsquo;s necklace from his pocket, the necklace he found under Steve&rsquo;s broken shield after the regretful fight in Siberia that almost took her life. The sapphire pendant caught (Y/N)&rsquo;s attention as it mingled with the light, casting a reflection on the window&rsquo;s glass. With trembling fingers, (Y/N) caressed the silver chain from Tony&rsquo;s hand, her mother&rsquo;s necklace, and pressed it to her lips as her body fell into Tony&rsquo;s arms that held her tight to his chest. Kissing the top of her head, he let her cry on him as she had allowed him to for so many years, quietly rocking her until her breathing became more stable.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;If you want to talk about it&hellip;&rdquo; Tony whispered as (Y/N) sniffed, letting Tony support her.</p><p>&ldquo;I was back under the knife&hellip;under Hydra. It was like I was a little girl again&hellip;alone and afraid. It felt like every bit of confidence I&rsquo;d built up had never existed. Like I was theirs for the taking&hellip;which I guess I was. They did pay a hefty price for me,&rdquo; (Y/N) joked darkly as Tony rubbed her arm, but she shook herself off, wiping her eyes. &ldquo;But like I said, the Universe hangs in the balance. We don&rsquo;t have time for my bullshit-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not bullshit,&rdquo; Tony interrupted, but (Y/N) shook her head.</p><p>&ldquo;It is. All that happened years ago, and I&rsquo;ve moved on, and&hellip;and don&rsquo;t roll your eyes at me, I have,&rdquo; (Y/N) smacked Tony with a laugh, both knowing they were too fucked up beyond repair. &ldquo;Whatever. Besides&hellip;I have to apologize to you, too-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, you-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I do. I fought fire with fire. I should&rsquo;ve expected to get burned.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And apparently I shouldn&rsquo;t have gone off my meds,&rdquo; Tony joked.</p><p>&ldquo;We all make mistakes,&rdquo; (Y/N) shrugged, but was clearly still in deep pain. Tony recognized it, but also realized they were short on time and energy. &ldquo;How much are you caught up on?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Too much, but also not nearly enough.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Perfect, we can work with that,&rdquo; (Y/N) retorted sarcastically as she made her way towards the stairs, but Tony stopped her one last time.</p><p>&ldquo;I just need to know what I&rsquo;m working with. Are you okay to handle this? Hey! No bullshit. Are you okay?&rdquo; Tony asked, leveling his eyes with hers, not letting her look away from him.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; (Y/N) answered candidly, not even expecting her own answer. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t really have a choice now, do I?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look like it,&rdquo; Tony sighed sadly, then smiled at her. &ldquo;But it does look like you&rsquo;ve got your fire back,&rdquo; Tony nodded as he held the amethyst locket that rested on (Y/N)&rsquo;s chest in a pendant similar to Strange&rsquo;s that intertwined with (Y/N)&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s necklace. &ldquo;Things could be worse. At least this Thanos character doesn&rsquo;t have it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And let&rsquo;s keep it way,&rdquo; (Y/N) smirked with a cock of her eyebrow, making Tony grin as they joined the new team downstairs in the foyer. Bruce paced nervously, flicking his eyes up to (Y/N) as he asked her a silent &lsquo;are you okay&rsquo; that (Y/N) nodded to without a word as she looked towards Strange who seemed unsure of what to say, so she let him off the hook.</p><p>&ldquo;I know that you didn&rsquo;t mean for any of that to happen,&rdquo; (Y/N) assured him. &ldquo;You just caught me off guard&hellip;which isn&rsquo;t an easy thing to do, so I guess congratulations are in order, sir,&rdquo; (Y/N) saluted him as he rolled his eyes, allowing some of the tension to be relieved of the room. &ldquo;So, Thanos. He&rsquo;s coming. He&rsquo;s evil. He&rsquo;s probably ugly. What the hell do we do about it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Botox?&rdquo; Tony offered jokingly, but (Y/N) was quick.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe later. I&rsquo;m waiting for my forties,&rdquo; (Y/N) responded immediately making everyone laugh. &ldquo;But no, seriously. From a scientific standpoint, are Steve and I even going to age? You know, because of the super soldier serum. I swear that man hasn&rsquo;t earned a wrinkle since the day we first met,&rdquo; (Y/N) rambled as she walked around the room in deep thought. &ldquo;I mean, because I can&rsquo;t wait to age. Like, I can&rsquo;t wait to grow old with Steve and our highlight of the month is our weekly trip to Target, or Costco, or something. And we rent those little scooter/cart things, but not as jokes because we actually need them. But also as a joke because they&rsquo;re fucking hilarious. And then we get home and eat&hellip;whatever old people eat, like vanilla wafers and pretzels all day and watch the sunset in our Tommy Bahama lawn chairs&hellip;but we don&rsquo;t actually watch the sunset because we fall asleep at like four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. And like-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Holy shit, (Y/N)!&rdquo; Tony yelled out, trying to stop her as he leaned over a table in a chorus of laughter with Bruce, Wong, and Strange. &ldquo;We get it. You&rsquo;re ready to get old. Shit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, I know. The point about Thanos, uh&hellip;damn, where is the point and why can&rsquo;t I find it right now?&rdquo; (Y/N) mused out loud to herself, but Bruce helped her out.</p><p>&ldquo;The point is, we have these stones. We know where they are. Vision is out there somewhere with the Mind Stone and we have to find him. Now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, well that&rsquo;s the thing&hellip;two weeks ago, Vision turned off his transponder,&rdquo; Tony answered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s offline.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wonder why,&rdquo; (Y/N) taunted darkly, then shook her head. &ldquo;No, wait. He was on your side. Seriously, why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I found out about him and Wanda playing house somewhere in Scotland,&rdquo; Tony groaned. &ldquo;When I first designed Jarvis, I never thought he&rsquo;d become so&hellip;evolved.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aw! I&rsquo;m so happy for them! Like a weird Bonnie and Clyde type of thing,&rdquo; (Y/N) gushed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty fucking cute.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s illegal,&rdquo; Tony deadpanned, but (Y/N) was still smiling.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what makes it so cute. I approve. Not that my approval matters, but she&rsquo;ll get an earful when I find her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, is anyone going to explain to me what the hell happened here while I was gone? Like the part where you almost killed her in Siberia? Care to explain that, Tony?&rdquo; Bruce shouted at Tony and (Y/N) who stared blankly at him, until Tony turned on (Y/N).</p><p>&ldquo;You never told him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Obviously, I told him the important bits,&rdquo; (Y/N) retorted darkly, making Tony narrow his eyes at her, then she threw her arms up. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t have time! We were on a mission to kill Thor&rsquo;s sister in space! We had bigger fish to fry than trying to explain Ant Man. Plus, I got distracted by Valkryie.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who the hell is Valkyrie?&rdquo; Tony exclaimed at (Y/N) who shot right back.</p><p>&ldquo;Look, all I&rsquo;m gonna say is that once I saw her fight, I wasn&rsquo;t sure I was straight anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Were you that sure to begin with?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not since Rihanna, no, but I feel like we&rsquo;re getting off topic again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say?&rdquo; Strange spoke up sarcastically, rubbing his temples. &ldquo;Is this how your team always functions?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, but it&rsquo;s how we always dysfunction,&rdquo; (Y/N) smirked as Bruce put his face in his hands.</p><p>&ldquo;You have no idea what I&rsquo;ve been through over the years,&rdquo; Bruce moaned as Tony tried to high five (Y/N), but she walked right past him, suddenly becoming very stoic which killed the vibe of the room. &ldquo;But for the past two years, I haven&rsquo;t been here so&hellip;fill me in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure you want to know?&rdquo; Tony asked, and Bruce hesitated but nodded anyway. Tony launched into the Sokovia Accords and what went down in Lagos, Berlin, in the airport, in Siberia, going into detail where he could, but brushing over the pieces that still weren&rsquo;t resolved. (Y/N) chimed in for certain pieces, but remained quiet for most of the explanation, instead curiously roaming the room looking at the strange artifacts from who even knew where? Strange and Wong began to tell a bit of their own story with Dormammu, providing context for who everyone was becoming allies with until Tony mentioned becoming a father. The sound of metal pinging the ground interrupted the conversation where everyone looked to the back corner of the room to find a very sheepish looking (Y/N). Playing it cool, she &ldquo;inconspicuously&rdquo; walked over to a large planter where she tossed a small piece of whatever she broke inside, whistling towards the ceiling as she wrapped her hands behind her back and rocked on her heels.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, hey guys!&rdquo; (Y/N) laughed nervously as she noticed them all staring. &ldquo;I was just&hellip;looking at the artifacts-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Priceless </i>artifacts,&rdquo; Strange interjected, making (Y/N) even more sheepish.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;yeah, those priceless&hellip;artifacts&hellip;&rdquo; (Y/N) coughed awkwardly, then went back to the same desk to look inside the drawer past the knob she just broke.</p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N)!&rdquo; Bruce chastised her as he shook his head, walking over to grab her by the arm.</p><p>&ldquo;What, it&rsquo;s already broken?&rdquo; (Y/N) complained in a situation that reminded Tony heavily of the good old days back in Stark Tower. It was frustrating to know that things might never go back to the way they were. He choked back a tear, keeping his face neutral as he snorted at her.</p><p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t mean breaking it more is the solution, punk,&rdquo; Tony teased her.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but I want to see what&rsquo;s inside! I want to be over there!&ldquo; (Y/N) yelled just as a vortex of black rimmed in purple light swallowed (Y/N) into the ground, making her appear a few terrifying seconds later over by the desk. Clearly, everyone was shook. Even Wong looked shook.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;but I was&hellip;and now I&rsquo;m&hellip;&rdquo; (Y/N) muttered numbly, pointing from Bruce to where she was, then narrowed her eyes at Strange and Wong. &ldquo;Alright, which one of you fuckers did it?&rdquo; Strange and Wong just shook their heads in awe. &ldquo;No? Neither of you decided to add this to your magic show?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N)&hellip;I think that was the stone,&rdquo; Bruce pointed out, making (Y/N) look down to the after-glow of the Power Stone that was now settling on her chest again. With a smirk, (Y/N) lifted her chin high to address the men as she princess waved at them, blowing them sarcastic kisses. &ldquo;Thank you, thank you! I&rsquo;ve officially surpassed all of you peasants with my greatness. You&rsquo;re welcome for allowing you all to witness my upgrade. Excuse me while I single-handedly go take down Thanos,&rdquo; (Y/N) joked as she made her way towards the door, but Bruce took her by the arm again.</p><p>&ldquo;Not just yet,&rdquo; Bruce laughed. &ldquo;We still need to find Vision.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, who could find him?&rdquo; Strange asked.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;shit&hellip;probably Steve Rogers,&rdquo; Tony replied, looking up to (Y/N) as Strange just about lost it.</p><p>&ldquo;Funny thing is, he was already here,&rdquo; (Y/N) sighed, making Tony cock his head. &ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s probably why Doctor Fancycape over there is losing his shit. Him, Sam, Scott, and I came here to escape, well&hellip;you,&rdquo; (Y/N) choked as Tony looked at the floor in guilt. &ldquo;I told you, you and your government friends made us run pretty far.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I never meant for things to get so&hellip;complicated,&rdquo; Tony shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, Tony. Turns out life is complicated. I know, I&rsquo;m surprised too,&rdquo; (Y/N) retorted, quickly turning the dark conversation light. &ldquo;But, not like in a good way. Like a, surprise! Happy birthday kind of way, but more of a, surprise! Your dog is dead, kind of way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You learn something new every day,&rdquo; Tony responded with a half-smile that didn&rsquo;t really reach his eyes. &ldquo;But still, it&rsquo;s not that easy. Cap and I fell out hard. We&rsquo;re still not on speaking terms.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony, listen to me,&rdquo; Bruce cautioned as he approached Tony. &ldquo;Thor&rsquo;s gone. Thanos is coming. It doesn&rsquo;t matter who you&rsquo;re talking to, or not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s right, Tony,&rdquo; (Y/N) chimed in, then shrugged. &ldquo;Besides, you already have half the power couple. What&rsquo;s one more?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A whole power couple?&rdquo; Tony teased her.</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm, math. I&rsquo;m impressed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, not exactly the kind of math that I want to be doing. You, I can handle, but Spangles?&rdquo; Tony scratched the back of his neck. &ldquo;I almost caused the end for not one, but two of my best friend&rsquo;s lives and one of those happened to be his alter-ego. Couldn&rsquo;t be more different than him, yet more perfect&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is that the speech you&rsquo;re gonna give at our wedding? Because it sucks,&rdquo; (Y/N) deadpanned.</p><p>&ldquo;Would you just let me&hellip;&rdquo; Tony groaning, running a hand over his face as (Y/N) took a step back. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t know if I can face him after everything&hellip;&rdquo; Tony let the statement hang in the air.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you have a way to contact Rogers, or not?&rdquo; Strange asked. &ldquo;Because I can&rsquo;t seem to find him in any of the portals I cast. I can try a locating spell, but those will take a few days to-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother,&rdquo; Tony interrupted as he sighed. After a moment of hesitation, he slipped the flip phone Steve sent him from his pocket. (Y/N) just stared at the little silver piece of the 90&rsquo;s and gawked, concealing the moment she almost dropped her jaw by clearing her throat.</p><p>&ldquo;First of all, I refuse to get sentimental about that,&rdquo; (Y/N) stated into the silent room, making Tony smile at her awkwardness as she swallowed. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you still have that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was the only way to contact you and Steve&hellip;of course I still have it,&rdquo; Tony admitted.</p><p>&ldquo;Stop it, alright?&rdquo; (Y/N) choked out, not masking her emotions as well as she would have liked which made Tony&rsquo;s heart inflate with hope. &ldquo;Or else I might actually forgive you. Which, then I would never forgive myself for being a pushover, which I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; Tony agreed as they held each other&rsquo;s eyes. (Y/N) rolled them to break the contact, crossing her arms across her chest.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still mad at you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you are.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well? You gonna call him, or not?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony dropped his smile immediately, scrunching her eyebrows down at the phone as he opened up the only contact programmed into the device. The name projected from the screen like a voice demanding to be called. He&rsquo;d wanted to call for months now, but&hellip;but the time never felt right. He always felt like even if he were to call, that he wouldn&rsquo;t know what to say. He knew he wanted to apologize to (Y/N), but it wasn&rsquo;t her phone. This was Steve. Completely different story. And he knew for a fact that Steve would always answer, but it wasn&rsquo;t really him that he wanted to talk to. He did, but it was always-</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, for fuck&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; (Y/N) yelled impatiently as she tried to grab the phone from Tony&rsquo;s grasp, but instead, the device clattered to the ground at their feet where they both dove for it.</p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N)! Why do you keep breaking things?&rdquo; Tony shouted at her as they fought for control.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you kidding me? This thing is more indestructible than your suits!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As upset as that makes me, you&rsquo;re probably right,&rdquo; Tony shrugged, but still held fast.</p><p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t we just discuss how I&rsquo;m always right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not always, just more often than I thought!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not wrong about this!&rdquo; (Y/N) groaned as she froze Tony&rsquo;s hand a bit in a little sting to make him let go. With a huff, (Y/N) smirked. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s test this shall we?&rdquo; (Y/N) taunted as she prepared to stupidly throw the phone at the wall just to prove Tony wrong, but Bruce stole it from her instead, holding it just out of her reach as Tony was still hanging on her shoulder, reaching for the device. &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; (Y/N) called at Bruce, but he ignored her and went in to call Steve himself.</p><p>Suddenly, the air shifted. A dull hum droned above everyone&rsquo;s heads from the hole in the ceiling where Bruce came crashing to Earth. (Y/N) followed Tony&rsquo;s gaze to look at Strange who&rsquo;s fringe was twitching with the pulsating energy that tugged at everyone&rsquo;s guts like the push and pulls of the ocean tides.</p><p>&ldquo;Say, Doc. You wouldn&rsquo;t happen to be moving your hair, now would you?&rdquo; Tony asked Strange who watched his own wisp of hair dance ominously on his forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;Not at the moment, no,&rdquo; Strange answered as Tony and (Y/N) looked at each other, confirming each other&rsquo;s suspicions that something was about to happen with the fear in their eyes. Tony squeezed (Y/N)&rsquo;s shoulder to assure her as best he could as she began to walk towards the door, looking through the window to catch a glimpse of people rushing the streets in pure terror.</p><p>&ldquo;All I have to say is, they messed with the wrong bitch at the wrong time,&rdquo; (Y/N) snarled as she shoved her way out into the streets, her hair getting swept up by the whirlwind that gusted through the canyon made by the towering buildings on each side of the street. The sky was barely visible through the ash and dust that was a low-hanging smog that made the city feel more and more unbearably claustrophobic by the second. Car horns were honking as traffic became a stand-still, people abandoning their vehicles to escape whatever was in the skies behind them, their terrified expressions peering over their shoulders like a horror movie come to life. (Y/N) heard her team attempting to help people on the streets, but she was determined to see what she was up against. She marched into the middle of the road, becoming mesmerized by the hollow spaceship that hovered above the smoke and grime like a Death Star donut. Struck by the ship, (Y/N) failed to notice the car hood that would&rsquo;ve sliced her own head off had Tony not tackled her to the ground, cradling her head in his arms as they went down.</p><p>Breaking from her trance, she looked up to Tony who looked just as relieved as she felt.</p><p>&ldquo;Suddenly, I&rsquo;m overcome with the feeling to forgive you,&rdquo; (Y/N) breathed out as Tony pulled her to her feet, each steadying the other.</p><p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t do something stupid like that, and I won&rsquo;t have to save you again,&rdquo; Tony quipped, making (Y/N) push him off of her as they both ran around the street corner to where the ship was hovering over the dead-stop traffic like an apocalyptic wasteland where the dust storm was worse than ever. Strange stood beside (Y/N), gathering his magic to wisp aside most of the smog, but the view wasn&rsquo;t much better in the clear, finally getting the full frontal of the spaceship in all it&rsquo;s petrifying glory. &ldquo;Friday! Evac anyone south of 43<sup>rd&nbsp;</sup>Street! Notify first responders!&rdquo; Tony called to Friday, but (Y/N) stepped out in front of him with her hands pulsating in a purple glow that sent chills through his body.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother,&rdquo; (Y/N) growled lowly to Tony and Strange, cracking her neck as her eyes glared daggers at the ship, the stone beginning to levitate off her chest. &ldquo;They either find their way home, or they find themselves in a body bag. No more than ten blocks out, or they&rsquo;re dead. No more negotiations,&rdquo; (Y/N) asserted as she gritted her teeth, paving the way through the rubble towards the electric beam of blue light about a mile down the street, the light in her eyes demanding a war to not just be fought but to be won.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Taglist</b>: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYlu0CG6g0HV126mDX5EUAA\">@shannonr2003</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlSoQ-tzWXqmHBQjEOwnDYg\">@briannabloom</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muXrTh8-Cv3mjVDxjEs3Ktg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muXrTh8-Cv3mjVDxjEs3Ktg\">@ever-so-slightly-below-average</a></p><p>**Let me know if you want to be on the taglist (and yes, I will actually keep it up to date this time).
