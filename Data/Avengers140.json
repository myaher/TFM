For once Tony hadn\u2019t planned one of his big parties, tonight was all about family. The family that you had found in the Avengers.

You could feel the tears in the corners of your eyes. It was hard for you to look back at the time when you still lived with your parents.

This was in the early stages of your father\u2019s dementia, while your mother still didn\u2019t know about his illness.\u00a0</p><p>Bucky noticed how you suddenly became silent, while you normally were happy during these types of activities. He put his arm around your shoulder pulling you closer to his body, that was when you broke. You didn\u2019t mean to just start sobbing like crazy, but here you were sitting on the couch with tears streaming down your face. Tony was the only one who knew the real reason for your sudden outburst, the others only knew that there had been trouble in your family back then.

It amazes me to see how we\u2019ve all grown over the past couple of years, from the day that Iron Man became a thing, till the day we had a team, till today. We\u2019ve grown as a team both in number and in the sense that we are stronger than we\u2019ve ever been.

You had always hated the thought of fireworks going off in the sky, but tonight something had changed, you had learned how much of a family you all were.

I\u2019ll even go first.  Mine is to finally make an honest woman out of Pepper.\u201d</p><p>A soft look came over Pepper\u2019s face as she leaned in and gave her fianc\u00e9 a kiss.  \u201cWouldn\u2019t you know it\u2014that\u2019s mine, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think you can make an honest man out of Tony Stark?\u201d Rhodey asked as he began to laugh and shake his head.</p><p>Pepper\u2019s brow furrowed in disbelief.  \u201cOh, good Lord no.  I meant my that my resolution would be for Tony to make an honest woman out of me.\u201d</p><p>Rhodey nodded his head as everyone burst into laughter at her response.  \u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, who\u2019s next?\u201d Tony asked with a clap of his hands.  \u201cNo more joking around.  Some of us are getting a second chance at life, so we need to take this seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony\u2019s right,\u201d Steve said as he sat up and braced his arms on his legs.  \u201cIt\u2019s been a rough year, but we\u2019re getting a second chance to make things right.\u201d  He paused as he met the eyes of everyone in the room.  \u201cI\u2019ve got a list from the Make-A-Wish Foundation a mile long.  Some of those kids may have made it back from the Soul Stone, but they\u2019ve still got a death sentence hanging over their heads.  I really need to make an effort this year to personally visit each one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an admirable goal,\u201d Vision said with a nod in Steve\u2019s direction.  \u201cAs for me, I haven\u2019t been\u2026alive\u2014so to speak\u2014for very long, but I\u2019ve already experienced both birth and death.  I want to take this year to focus on living.\u201d</p><p>Wanda reached over and took Vision\u2019s hand as they shared a loving look.  \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be by your side every step of the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to focus on making every day count this year,\u201d YN said with a tight-lipped smile.  \u201cLosing so many people to the snap\u2014and the stress of not knowing if we could save them\u2014really took it\u2019s toll on me.\u201d</p><p>The group grew somber as they processed the truth of YN\u2019s words.  They\u2019d each gone through something traumatic in the aftermath of Thanos, and it would be a long time before any of them could truly say they\u2019d gotten over it.</p><p>\u201cI want to get back to the VA,\u201d Sam said when the silence in the room had stretched out for a few moments.  \u201cTheir PTSD is going to be off the charts after this whole fiasco\u2014I know mine is.\u201d</p><p> \u201cThe government is an absolute mess right now,\u201d Rhodey added with a sigh.  \u201cAs much as I hate it, they\u2019re going to need someone with a clear head leading the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is good,\u201d Tony said with a smile on his face.  \u201cI really feel like we\u2019re getting somewhere.  Who\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d Nat volunteered as she leaned back and crossed her legs.  \u201cWe all know how much red I\u2019ve got\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough of that shit,\u201d Clint said, interrupting his best friend.  \u201cTasha, you\u2019ve saved the world\u2026 What?  Four or five times now?\u201d  With a brusque wave of his hand, he continued.  \u201cI\u2019ve lost count of how many times\u2014although I do know that the one time I wasn\u2019t invited to the party half the universe got zapped out of existence.  Not saying that that had anything to do with it, but once I came back, everything got put back the way it was before.\u201d</p><p>A pillow came flying from somewhere to Clint\u2019s left, and he easily dodged it.  Laughing, he grabbed it and threw it in Sam\u2019s direction since he was fairly certain the former Paratrooper was the one that had lobbed it at his head.</p><p>Turning back to Natasha, his face became serious again.  \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone when I say this, but you\u2019re a hero\u2014you\u2019ve wiped out all the red in your ledger so you\u2019re going to have to come up with something better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeroine,\u201d Maria interjected as she swirled the amber colored liquid in her glass.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Hill.  Did I hear you correctly?\u201d Tony asked, his eyes wide with disbelief.  \u201cAre you saying your New Years resolution is to do drugs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here I thought you were the one with the genius-level IQ,\u201d Fury said as he rolled his one good eye.</p><p>\u201cHeroine\u2014as in a courageous woman,\u201d Maria clarified.  With a snort she added, \u201cObviously, I\u2019m going to need to spend some more time working on the feminist agenda this year.\u201d</p><p>Bruce tipped his bottle of beer up and drained the last few drops before speaking.  \u201cI know what I need to do this year\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, yeah,\u201d Tony said as he fell back into the couch cushions with a groan.  \u201cAnger management\u2026gotta control the Hulk\u2026\u201d  He sat up and pointed a finger at his friend.  \u201cYou say the same thing every year, Banner.  You and Romanoff have gotta come up with something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact,\u201d Bruce said as tinges of green began to creep up from beneath the collar of his shirt.  \u201cThat\u2019s the exact opposite of what I was going to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d Tony asked, his voice dripping with sarcasm.  \u201cPlease, by all means, wow us with this spectacular revelation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Bruce said, his voice clipped in poorly controlled rage.  <b>\u201cMy resolution is to let my anger have full reign this year\u2026\u201d</b></p><p>\u201cWoah,\u201d Bucky said as his eyes started to grow wide.  \u201cI know I\u2019m not really a part of this little group, but that does not sound like a good idea at all.\u201d</p><p>Tony threw his hands up in frustration.  \u201cDammit, Banner.  Look what you\u2019ve done.  You\u2019ve gone and made me agree with Barnes.  This year is starting off with a bang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, now, Stark,\u201d Thor interjected as he placed a hand on Bruce\u2019s shoulder.  \u201cI think you\u2019re misjudging Banner.  I\u2019ve spent some time with the Hulk and he\u2019s quite the charming fellow\u2014a little rough around the edges, but all in all not that bad .\u201d Thor paused and whispered to Bruce.  \u201cI prefer you, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your resolution, Thor?\u201d Steve asked, trying to ease the tension in the room.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have New Years resolutions on Asgard, but since Asgard is no more, I guess it\u2019s best for me to start adapting to Midgardian customs.\u201d  He took a deep breath and thought for a moment.  \u201cI should probably spend more time with my family, if the truth be told.\u201d</p><p>There was a long stretch of silence as everyone in the room looked to one another in confusion.  </p><p>Nat was the first to ask the question everyone else was thinking. \u201cIsn\u2019t all of your family dead?\u201d </p><p>Thor\u2019s face split into a wide grin as he tipped the flask of Asgardian mead to his lips.  As he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, he gave Fury a pointed look.</p><p>A shimming green light enveloped the former S.H.I.E.L.D. director as the magic surrounding him began to dissipate to reveal the one person no one wanted to see.</p><p>\u201cSurprise,\u201d Loki said with his signature smirk.</p><p>The room of superheroes sat in stunned silence as they each tried to figure out how long Loki had been masquerading as their former boss.  The vein on the side of Tony\u2019s head was starting to bulge as his face started getting redder and redder.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Pietro asked with a snort.  \u201cYou didn\u2019t see that coming?\u201d</p><p>_______________</p><p><i>Thank you for reading Day 1 of my writing challenge!
