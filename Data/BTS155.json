Then you broke out of the forest and sighed as you collected yourself and walked confidently to work. You waved hello to Onew and Taemin, the security guards at the Sanctuary front gate, and headed out into the town. <br/>Snow floated down, completely picturesque.<br/>Until work came into sight and you had to remind yourself that work was necessary for food and that you could be doing worse jobs. Like that car-wash job you had two years ago where you almost got hypothermia everyday and eventually had to quit because you ended up getting bronchitis which almost turned into pneumonia. A different worker ended up suing the place and you ended up getting part of the payout, which went straight to your medical bills.<br/>Trendy Tails was by far the best job you\u2019d ever had. You get clothing half-off and most of the hybrid customers remember when they weren\u2019t free and tend to be kinder to you. It\u2019s the young ones that make the day miserable because they act like entitled brats and make the wolf in you want to pin them down and show them that they can\u2019t even begin to act like they\u2019re over you. Only an alpha wolf could lord over you, and only within reason too. You were hardwired to follow your leader, protect them and the pack, and to help keep any challengers from rising in power, to bear pups for your leader and pack. You were also hardwired as a human to lead and be independent and question orders, to examine things with a set of morals all your own and decide if what you would be doing is truly good. The two actually combined well for once to create a mindset that helped you both lead and follow, to obey and question in accordance to the situation.<br/>But for some reason work just made your wolf want to show all of these brats who was actually superior in the food chain. It may be petty, but some days you just felt that way.<br/>That day quickly turned into one of those days as teenagers passed through. And preteens.<br/>Not only did they leave the clothing in a mess, but they were loud and demanding and you had to report them to your boss for trying to shoplift.<br/>Which of course ended up in you trying to avoid sneering at the teens backs when they gave you haughty looks when the police let them go.<br/>Your day went downhill from there.<br/>Some poor kid came in with his mom, and he was already complaining of not feeling well, but she ignored him and he ended up throwing up on the floor\u2026and some of the merchandise.<br/>Your boss threw a fit over the merchandise while you were stuck cleaning up the floor and comforting the child after his mother scolded him and then went to talk with your boss about the items.<br/>Poor little pup felt terrible, and you could help but notice that he had a bad fever as you wiped his face with some paper towel and he sobbed apologies to you.<br/>You shushed him gently. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You weren\u2019t feeling good. It\u2019s not a big deal. Come on, we should tell your mom how bad you\u2019re feeling.\u201d You picked him up since he looked ready to collapse and carried him over. \u201cMa\u2019am!\u201d<br/>Both your boss and the kids mom looked at you with annoyance.<br/>\u201cYou should really take him to the doctor, he\u2019s got a pretty bad fever,\u201d You said, biting your lip.<br/>Both of them felt his face and the mother slapped down some money before taking her son from your and hurrying out the door.<br/>The rest of the cost came out of your pay. <br/>You sprayed disinfectant everywhere, and managed to get the smell out of the place by the time the next customer came along.<br/>Rude customers streamed through and you felt all of the happiness and cheerfulness from your morning turn into dust and blow away on the stifling breeze from the heating vent above your head.<br/>\u201cI\u2019ve never been in here before, but I think I might like it,\u201d A man said from behind you.<br/>You turned from where you were folding shirts, ready to reply something a little snarky since he was quite obviously hitting on you, only to stop and feel a smile start to spread.<br/>Namjoon smirked at you. \u201cYou were about to tell me off, weren\u2019t you?\u201d<br/>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long day,\u201d You whispered, excitement starting to fill you. \u201cHi.\u201d<br/>\u201cHi. Is there a reason you\u2019re whispering?\u201d<br/>\u201cMy boss doesn\u2019t like me chatting up the customers,\u201d You replied, biting your lip to contain the energy that just seeing him brought you. This should definitely be enough to get you through the last half-hour of your shift.<br/>He glanced around, then stepped in close and tucked his head into your neck the moment you tilted your head so he could. He breathed in your scent like it was a drug.<br/>You were definitely addicted to him. \u201cWhat brings you to my neck of the woods? And after such a long time. I haven\u2019t seen you since the parade. I\u2019m not normally this forgiving.\u201d<br/>He pulled back, looking at his feet in embarrassment and maybe guilt. \u201cI meant to come the next week, but I got pulled away by work. I\u2019m back now. I thought I would come see if you were still\u2026if we could still\u2026\u201d<br/>You moved forward, placing a kiss on his cheek before nuzzling into his neck to breath in and drown in his scent. \u201cI get off work in half an hour. Want to go to the ice skating pond? I know it\u2019s not completely frozen but the path around there is still great.\u201d<br/>His shoulders relaxed and he leaned his head on yours. \u201cI think I can kill some time in here. Go get back to work. I\u2019ll be watching.\u201d<br/>You felt a sort of excited shiver go up your spine at the thought of him watching you, as if assessing you for compatibility, and you nodded firmly before turned and walking towards the next rack you had to straighten out with a bit of swing in your hips. That low throated growl that he quickly swallowed with an embarrassed and very forced cough was enough to have you grinning.<br/>Your boss checked him out when he purchased something so you could finish straightening the last rack of tail-friendly lingerie. You were curious as to what he bought, but you couldn\u2019t see past the rack of adult footie pajamas.<br/>Finally, you managed to clock out and get your stuff.<br/>He was waiting outside, and grinned when you came rushing out to him. \u201cHey.\u201d<br/>\u201cChristmas shopping?\u201d You asked, nodding toward the bag.<br/>He nodded. \u201cI have a few people left still. This helps, though. Besides, I didn\u2019t want him to think I was loitering.\u201d He leaned down and kissed you.<br/>It was as good as you remembered. Better even.<br/>He wasn\u2019t holding back because of a small child that might look up at any moment. His hands freely felt your body, then slid through your hair, tugging gently to see your response.<br/>You bit his lip playfully, then pulled away.<br/>He looked so happy as he gazed at you, leading you with an arm around your waist toward the Sanctuary. \u201cYou looked like you were having a rough day before. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re able to smile like this now.\u201d<br/>\u201cI\u2019m talking with another wolf. A handsome, kind man, with the best smile and I\u2019m about to go walk through nature with him. What happened earlier is just a bad dream.\u201d You smiled up at him, blinking cutely.<br/>He kissed your eartip. \u201cAfter our walk we should get hot chocolate.\u201d<br/>\u201cOr I could make you some hot chocolate,\u201d You offered. \u201cI made my own mix and I have whipped cream\u2026\u201d <br/>His face looked a little red. \u201cUh, yeah. Whipped cream is\u2026good\u2026\u201d<br/>You blinked rapidly, suppressing a grin. \u201cGet your mind out of the bedroom, alpha.\u201d<br/>He turned completely red, looking at the sky. \u201cYou\u2019re shameless, aren\u2019t you?\u201d<br/>\u201cHmm, you\u2019re the one who went right to the bedroom but I\u2019m the shameless one?\u201d You tucked your arm around him, breathing his scent in deeply. \u201cI love your scent. So nice.\u201d<br/>He chuckled, seeming to relax with the change in conversation. \u201cYour smell is even better. Hey, do you ever find people looking at you because you just growled at a squirrel?\u201d<br/>\u201cYes! And it\u2019s not something you can help, it\u2019s just such a strong instinct\u2026\u201d<br/>He nodded, playfully biting your ear.<br/>You squeak and duck out of his grasp, hopping onto his back.<br/>He laughed and kept trudging forward, making sure you were secure on his back. \u201cI warn you now, I\u2019m kind of clumsy and tend to break things.\u201d<br/>\u201cJust don\u2019t break me and I\u2019ll reward you in a very pleasant way,\u201d You told him in a whisper, kissing just below his ear and feeling the way he sort of melted under your touch. \u201cI promise.\u201d<br/>He froze, then quickly pulled you off of his back and kissed you.<br/>You smiled and when he let go you let yourself fall back into the snow, creating a snow angel.<br/>He laughed and helped you up, carefully brushing the snow from your hair, then pressed kisses to your nose and cheeks. \u201cMy little snow angel. You love this weather, right?\u201d<br/>\u201cMmhmm, especially if I\u2019m full. If I\u2019m hungry then the cold weather makes me anxious.\u201d<br/>\u201cSame, it\u2019s that instinct that says that prey will be scarce.\u201d<br/>\u201cRight. One year I didn\u2019t have enough time to get groceries, the moment I opened the pantry and saw only one pack of instant soup I went into full blown panic, ate the soup, rushed to the store and got enough groceries to last me two months. Owner came home and just stared at the hoard of food I had in my room while I just shivered in the middle of the bed. Blew her extra expenditures and grocery budget for the month. Took her two days to get me to let her take some of my food, kept growling and snarling at her. Don\u2019t remember anything after running to the store.\u201d You shook your head. \u201cAnyway, I always have emergency food now.\u201d<br/>He laughed. \u201cI did that to myself once, but instead of running to the store, I ran to Emma and Jin\u2019s because that\u2019s where the majority of my pack could usually be found and where I knew there was food. Completely blacked out. When I came to, Jin had tied me up and was spoon-feeding me. The others were kind of stunned. Apparently I got close to one of the triplets in my\u2026whatever it was and when I wouldn\u2019t back away Jin forced me away. He\u2019s pack leader, but sometimes it\u2019s easy to forget because he\u2019s so\u2026gentle. He doesn\u2019t have a strong presence, but he\u2019s a leader in his own way. You\u2026mentioned an owner?\u201d<br/>\u201cFormer owner. She never really wanted me, but I was a gift to her. She was kind to me, but when the laws changed she made it clear that I had to find a job and that as soon as I\u2019d saved up some money I had to find my own place to live. Much easier said than done. Jobs were still really scarce back then.\u201d<br/>\u201cHow long did it take you to get enough money?\u201d<br/>\u201cI got the money after moving out. Couldn\u2019t stay. Her boyfriend\u2026\u201d You shook your head to hide your shiver and the bile that rose in your throat.<br/>Namjoon had stopped, turning you toward him. There was a strange glint in his eyes. \u201cDid he hurt you?\u201d<br/>You looked away, frowning. \u201cHe never got far. I just couldn\u2019t stay in that environment with him. I ran the first time he laid a hand on me. He\u2019s lucky I didn\u2019t stab him with the kitchen scissors I was using at the time.\u201d You folded your arms as you thought about how much more satisfying it would have been to stab him in the arm with those kitchen scissors the moment he touched you. <br/>\u201cHe\u2026\u201d Namjoon growled a little.<br/>You smiled and slid your arms around his waist. \u201cI didn\u2019t let him do anything to me, Namjoon-ah. I\u2019m a little too aggressive when it comes to my own self defense. I jumped the gun and ended up on the streets for a while, then I came here. To the Sanctuary. Worked some low-level jobs to get my apartment at Haven and then got this job at the shop which isn\u2019t great but it gives me something to do and a living. It all worked out for the best. I met you, right? Another wolf\u2026\u201d You blinked up at him happily.<br/>He looked down at you, then kissed you. \u201cYou know, before we were freed completely\u2026when my owner got married, I asked Emma about love. What it was like. She was in the early stages of her pregnancy and exhausted at the time. I asked her again, just a little while ago because I couldn\u2019t believe how much you\u2026struck me.\u201d<br/>You looked away, continuing walking as he kept talking.<br/>\u201cWe talked for a really long time. At the end of it, she said that being in a relationship with someone was knowing you would get hurt by them and that you would hurt them in return, but that the moments of pain were far outweighed by the moments of nursing each others wounds, fighting for each other, and working together against all other odds. And loving someone was looking at all the imperfections and seeing them as perfections because they\u2019re part of what makes that person who they are.\u201d<br/>You smiled. \u201cShe sounds like a very smart person. Who\u2019s Emma?\u201d<br/>\u201cOh, uh, you remember Minsu?\u201d<br/>You nodded, grinning. \u201cThe cutie.\u201d<br/>He grinned a little. \u201cYeah. Emma is his mom. My former owner\u2019s sister. She\u2019s kind of like a surrogate mother for all of us. She was the first human I\u2019ve ever trusted completely. Then through her, her brother, my former owner.\u201d<br/>Emma. Micheal. Jin.<br/>\u201cWait, you mean Emma as in Em the head of the administration offices at the Sanctuary, and the founder of the Sanctuary with her brother Micheal who built the sanctuary and both of which were the main players in getting hybrid rights?\u201d<br/>He nodded. \u201cYeah, we were adopted the day all of those laws passed that took away hybrid rights to get paid for work. They came in so she could officially adopt Jimin and Jungkook, and the worker, a decent guy, asked them to adopt us too. She adopted Hoseok because he volunteered, knowing we would all get separated eventually, Micheal adopted us. Me, Yoongi-hyung, and Taehyung-ssi. We stayed with her for a while before going to stay with Micheal.\u201d He spoke softly, almost reverently, as if speaking of sacred memories.<br/>You understood. There were moments like that in your own life that felt sacred, like speaking of them could tear the world apart. \u201cSo, that boy you were with at the parade was one of the triplets?\u201d<br/>He nodded again, smiling. \u201cYou know\u2026we\u2019re celebrating Christmas early with Micheal, Becca, and Timothy because there\u2019s a big hybrids rights thing that they\u2019re attending on Christmas. If you\u2019re not doing anything\u2026it\u2019d be kind of nice to introduce them to you. Taehyung\u2019s pretty sure I made you up.\u201d<br/>\u201cYou move fast,\u201d You teased, an excited bounce to your step. \u201cI like it.\u201d<br/>He smiled, but covered his mouth with an embarrassed laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re just\u2026\u201d<br/>\u201cPerfect, flawless, strong, witty, beautiful,\u201d You listed, skipping ahead slightly so you could stop and look back. \u201cOr were you going to say I\u2019m just getting your wolf all riled up?\u201d<br/>His gaze locked onto you and his shy smile turned into a confident smirk almost immediately. \u201cIf your tail was anything to go by, I\u2019d say you were the one getting riled up.\u201d<br/>You flicked your hair over your shoulder and kept walking. \u201cIt\u2019s the snow. Knowing it\u2019ll end makes me want pups in the spring when prey is fat.\u201d<br/>He caught up to you. \u201cOh? Are you often struck by this thought?\u201d<br/>\u201cOnly when I\u2019m with handsome canines. Being with a handsome wolf, that\u2019s just got my mind going places it definitely shouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m recalling wives tales, mythology, biology\u2026\u201d <br/>\u201cMammalogy and anatomy?\u201d He suggested the additions to the list as he claimed the spot around your waist with his arm.<br/>You smirked up at him. \u201cSo you experience those thoughts too, good to know.\u201d<br/>He laughed, and swung you around so that you were facing him and then he stooped slightly to kiss you. \u201cEveryone has those thoughts.\u201d<br/>\u201cBut not everyone is as wild,\u201d You countered, tilting your head and blinking up slowly at him.<br/>His eyes glittered with excitement and happiness. \u201cAre we going to fast? I mean\u2014\u201d<br/>\u201cI instinctively like you, besides, with all the talking we did at the Thanksgiving parade and how we\u2019ve basically exchanged life stories now, I think it\u2019s pretty safe to say that even though we\u2019re moving fast we\u2019re not exactly missing important conversations. It\u2019s natural for hybrids to instinctively choose people for their mates, based on smell and small interactions. I mean, can you name five hybrids who dated for long periods of time before finally mating instead of breaking up with that person when they meet someone that they instinctively are more attracted to?\u201d You challenged.<br/>He thought for a long time, then shook his head with a little laugh. \u201cI can\u2019t even name one.\u201d<br/>\u201cI can name two, and it was more because of the circumstances around them than an actual hesitancy to mate with each other. This is natural. Besides, just the idea of imagining someone else\u2019s scent mixing with yours makes me want to commit crimes that would set back hybrid rights irreparably.\u201d You shuddered, fighting back the snarl that came up in your throat as you inadvertently imagined it. It was natural for the scents of those in his pack to be on him, they mixed in subtly with his own scent, a part of who he was. But if another female outside of his pack so much as touched him and left a ghosting of her scent you thought you might have to hunt her down to satisfy the primal urge in your stomach.<br/>His phone rang in his pocket as he tipped your chin up toward him to kiss you, probably. He frowned and fished it out of his coat pocket, then he sighed. \u201cHang on, it\u2019s Jungkook-ssi.\u201d He walked away so he could talk.<br/>You watched him for a moment, then pounced around, making more snow angels, your mind at ease with him nearby ensuring your safety. The air was crisp and clean, and the snow-laden trees created the perfect landscape for you to enjoy.<br/>He dropped next to you and made a snow angel of his own, then got up and helped you up, laughing a little as he swept some snow from your hair and put his hat on your head. \u201cI have to go. Jungkook needs my help with some Christmas shopping and this is the only chance he\u2019s got to shop for the others. But, I\u2019ll pick you up? On Saturday? At ten?\u201d<br/>You smiled and nodded, then went on tiptoe to kiss him. \u201cI look forward to it.\u201d<br/>\u201cWe can have our own gift exchange another day, I promise,\u201d He murmured. \u201cAnd we should get together. Like, a lot.\u201d He placed a few kisses around your face, then wrapped his scarf around your neck, enveloping you in his scent, stealing your own scarf and wrapping it around his own neck.<br/>You gazed up at him adoringly. \u201cOkay.\u201d<br/>He kissed you again, then smiled and walked away, his coat covered in snow.<br/>Your snow angel.</p><p style=\"\"><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b><b><a href=\"https://writersrealmbts.tumblr.com/post/175143742856/masterlist\">Masterlist.</a> \u00a0 <b><b><a href=\"https://writersrealmbts.tumblr.com/post/180523511596/the-sanctuary-series\">Series Masterpost.</a>\u00a0 \u00a0<a href=\"https://writersrealmbts.tumblr.com/post/180323643401/cutie-pie\">Cutie Pie.</a>\u00a0 <a href=\"https://writersrealmbts.tumblr.com/post/181321540741/baby-its-cold-outside\">Baby, It\u2019s Cold Outside</a>.</b></b></b></b></p>",

Then you broke out of the forest and sighed as you collected yourself and walked confidently to work. You waved hello to Onew and Taemin, the security guards at the Sanctuary front gate, and headed out into the town. <br>Snow floated down, completely picturesque.<br>Until work came into sight and you had to remind yourself that work was necessary for food and that you could be doing worse jobs. Like that car-wash job you had two years ago where you almost got hypothermia everyday and eventually had to quit because you ended up getting bronchitis which almost turned into pneumonia. A different worker ended up suing the place and you ended up getting part of the payout, which went straight to your medical bills.<br>Trendy Tails was by far the best job you\u2019d ever had. You get clothing half-off and most of the hybrid customers remember when they weren\u2019t free and tend to be kinder to you. It\u2019s the young ones that make the day miserable because they act like entitled brats and make the wolf in you want to pin them down and show them that they can\u2019t even begin to act like they\u2019re over you. Only an alpha wolf could lord over you, and only within reason too. You were hardwired to follow your leader, protect them and the pack, and to help keep any challengers from rising in power, to bear pups for your leader and pack. You were also hardwired as a human to lead and be independent and question orders, to examine things with a set of morals all your own and decide if what you would be doing is truly good. The two actually combined well for once to create a mindset that helped you both lead and follow, to obey and question in accordance to the situation.<br>But for some reason work just made your wolf want to show all of these brats who was actually superior in the food chain. It may be petty, but some days you just felt that way.<br>That day quickly turned into one of those days as teenagers passed through. And preteens.<br>Not only did they leave the clothing in a mess, but they were loud and demanding and you had to report them to your boss for trying to shoplift.<br>Which of course ended up in you trying to avoid sneering at the teens backs when they gave you haughty looks when the police let them go.<br>Your day went downhill from there.<br>Some poor kid came in with his mom, and he was already complaining of not feeling well, but she ignored him and he ended up throwing up on the floor\u2026and some of the merchandise.<br>Your boss threw a fit over the merchandise while you were stuck cleaning up the floor and comforting the child after his mother scolded him and then went to talk with your boss about the items.<br>Poor little pup felt terrible, and you could help but notice that he had a bad fever as you wiped his face with some paper towel and he sobbed apologies to you.<br>You shushed him gently. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You weren\u2019t feeling good. It\u2019s not a big deal. Come on, we should tell your mom how bad you\u2019re feeling.\u201d You picked him up since he looked ready to collapse and carried him over. \u201cMa\u2019am!\u201d<br>Both your boss and the kids mom looked at you with annoyance.<br>\u201cYou should really take him to the doctor, he\u2019s got a pretty bad fever,\u201d You said, biting your lip.<br>Both of them felt his face and the mother slapped down some money before taking her son from your and hurrying out the door.<br>The rest of the cost came out of your pay. <br>You sprayed disinfectant everywhere, and managed to get the smell out of the place by the time the next customer came along.<br>Rude customers streamed through and you felt all of the happiness and cheerfulness from your morning turn into dust and blow away on the stifling breeze from the heating vent above your head.<br>\u201cI\u2019ve never been in here before, but I think I might like it,\u201d A man said from behind you.<br>You turned from where you were folding shirts, ready to reply something a little snarky since he was quite obviously hitting on you, only to stop and feel a smile start to spread.<br>Namjoon smirked at you. \u201cYou were about to tell me off, weren\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long day,\u201d You whispered, excitement starting to fill you. \u201cHi.\u201d<br>\u201cHi. Is there a reason you\u2019re whispering?\u201d<br>\u201cMy boss doesn\u2019t like me chatting up the customers,\u201d You replied, biting your lip to contain the energy that just seeing him brought you. This should definitely be enough to get you through the last half-hour of your shift.<br>He glanced around, then stepped in close and tucked his head into your neck the moment you tilted your head so he could. He breathed in your scent like it was a drug.<br>You were definitely addicted to him. \u201cWhat brings you to my neck of the woods? And after such a long time. I haven\u2019t seen you since the parade. I\u2019m not normally this forgiving.\u201d<br>He pulled back, looking at his feet in embarrassment and maybe guilt. \u201cI meant to come the next week, but I got pulled away by work. I\u2019m back now. I thought I would come see if you were still\u2026if we could still\u2026\u201d<br>You moved forward, placing a kiss on his cheek before nuzzling into his neck to breath in and drown in his scent. \u201cI get off work in half an hour. Want to go to the ice skating pond? I know it\u2019s not completely frozen but the path around there is still great.\u201d<br>His shoulders relaxed and he leaned his head on yours. \u201cI think I can kill some time in here. Go get back to work. I\u2019ll be watching.\u201d<br>You felt a sort of excited shiver go up your spine at the thought of him watching you, as if assessing you for compatibility, and you nodded firmly before turned and walking towards the next rack you had to straighten out with a bit of swing in your hips. That low throated growl that he quickly swallowed with an embarrassed and very forced cough was enough to have you grinning.<br>Your boss checked him out when he purchased something so you could finish straightening the last rack of tail-friendly lingerie. You were curious as to what he bought, but you couldn\u2019t see past the rack of adult footie pajamas.<br>Finally, you managed to clock out and get your stuff.<br>He was waiting outside, and grinned when you came rushing out to him. \u201cHey.\u201d<br>\u201cChristmas shopping?\u201d You asked, nodding toward the bag.<br>He nodded. \u201cI have a few people left still. This helps, though. Besides, I didn\u2019t want him to think I was loitering.\u201d He leaned down and kissed you.<br>It was as good as you remembered. Better even.<br>He wasn\u2019t holding back because of a small child that might look up at any moment. His hands freely felt your body, then slid through your hair, tugging gently to see your response.<br>You bit his lip playfully, then pulled away.<br>He looked so happy as he gazed at you, leading you with an arm around your waist toward the Sanctuary. \u201cYou looked like you were having a rough day before. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re able to smile like this now.\u201d<br>\u201cI\u2019m talking with another wolf. A handsome, kind man, with the best smile and I\u2019m about to go walk through nature with him. What happened earlier is just a bad dream.\u201d You smiled up at him, blinking cutely.<br>He kissed your eartip. \u201cAfter our walk we should get hot chocolate.\u201d<br>\u201cOr I could make you some hot chocolate,\u201d You offered. \u201cI made my own mix and I have whipped cream\u2026\u201d <br>His face looked a little red. \u201cUh, yeah. Whipped cream is\u2026good\u2026\u201d<br>You blinked rapidly, suppressing a grin. \u201cGet your mind out of the bedroom, alpha.\u201d<br>He turned completely red, looking at the sky. \u201cYou\u2019re shameless, aren\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\u201cHmm, you\u2019re the one who went right to the bedroom but I\u2019m the shameless one?\u201d You tucked your arm around him, breathing his scent in deeply. \u201cI love your scent. So nice.\u201d<br>He chuckled, seeming to relax with the change in conversation. \u201cYour smell is even better. Hey, do you ever find people looking at you because you just growled at a squirrel?\u201d<br>\u201cYes! And it\u2019s not something you can help, it\u2019s just such a strong instinct\u2026\u201d<br>He nodded, playfully biting your ear.<br>You squeak and duck out of his grasp, hopping onto his back.<br>He laughed and kept trudging forward, making sure you were secure on his back. \u201cI warn you now, I\u2019m kind of clumsy and tend to break things.\u201d<br>\u201cJust don\u2019t break me and I\u2019ll reward you in a very pleasant way,\u201d You told him in a whisper, kissing just below his ear and feeling the way he sort of melted under your touch. \u201cI promise.\u201d<br>He froze, then quickly pulled you off of his back and kissed you.<br>You smiled and when he let go you let yourself fall back into the snow, creating a snow angel.<br>He laughed and helped you up, carefully brushing the snow from your hair, then pressed kisses to your nose and cheeks. \u201cMy little snow angel. You love this weather, right?\u201d<br>\u201cMmhmm, especially if I\u2019m full. If I\u2019m hungry then the cold weather makes me anxious.\u201d<br>\u201cSame, it\u2019s that instinct that says that prey will be scarce.\u201d<br>\u201cRight. One year I didn\u2019t have enough time to get groceries, the moment I opened the pantry and saw only one pack of instant soup I went into full blown panic, ate the soup, rushed to the store and got enough groceries to last me two months. Owner came home and just stared at the hoard of food I had in my room while I just shivered in the middle of the bed. Blew her extra expenditures and grocery budget for the month. Took her two days to get me to let her take some of my food, kept growling and snarling at her. Don\u2019t remember anything after running to the store.\u201d You shook your head. \u201cAnyway, I always have emergency food now.\u201d<br>He laughed. \u201cI did that to myself once, but instead of running to the store, I ran to Emma and Jin\u2019s because that\u2019s where the majority of my pack could usually be found and where I knew there was food. Completely blacked out. When I came to, Jin had tied me up and was spoon-feeding me. The others were kind of stunned. Apparently I got close to one of the triplets in my\u2026whatever it was and when I wouldn\u2019t back away Jin forced me away. He\u2019s pack leader, but sometimes it\u2019s easy to forget because he\u2019s so\u2026gentle. He doesn\u2019t have a strong presence, but he\u2019s a leader in his own way. You\u2026mentioned an owner?\u201d<br>\u201cFormer owner. She never really wanted me, but I was a gift to her. She was kind to me, but when the laws changed she made it clear that I had to find a job and that as soon as I\u2019d saved up some money I had to find my own place to live. Much easier said than done. Jobs were still really scarce back then.\u201d<br>\u201cHow long did it take you to get enough money?\u201d<br>\u201cI got the money after moving out. Couldn\u2019t stay. Her boyfriend\u2026\u201d You shook your head to hide your shiver and the bile that rose in your throat.<br>Namjoon had stopped, turning you toward him. There was a strange glint in his eyes. \u201cDid he hurt you?\u201d<br>You looked away, frowning. \u201cHe never got far. I just couldn\u2019t stay in that environment with him. I ran the first time he laid a hand on me. He\u2019s lucky I didn\u2019t stab him with the kitchen scissors I was using at the time.\u201d You folded your arms as you thought about how much more satisfying it would have been to stab him in the arm with those kitchen scissors the moment he touched you. <br>\u201cHe\u2026\u201d Namjoon growled a little.<br>You smiled and slid your arms around his waist. \u201cI didn\u2019t let him do anything to me, Namjoon-ah. I\u2019m a little too aggressive when it comes to my own self defense. I jumped the gun and ended up on the streets for a while, then I came here. To the Sanctuary. Worked some low-level jobs to get my apartment at Haven and then got this job at the shop which isn\u2019t great but it gives me something to do and a living. It all worked out for the best. I met you, right? Another wolf\u2026\u201d You blinked up at him happily.<br>He looked down at you, then kissed you. \u201cYou know, before we were freed completely\u2026when my owner got married, I asked Emma about love. What it was like. She was in the early stages of her pregnancy and exhausted at the time. I asked her again, just a little while ago because I couldn\u2019t believe how much you\u2026struck me.\u201d<br>You looked away, continuing walking as he kept talking.<br>\u201cWe talked for a really long time. At the end of it, she said that being in a relationship with someone was knowing you would get hurt by them and that you would hurt them in return, but that the moments of pain were far outweighed by the moments of nursing each others wounds, fighting for each other, and working together against all other odds. And loving someone was looking at all the imperfections and seeing them as perfections because they\u2019re part of what makes that person who they are.\u201d<br>You smiled. \u201cShe sounds like a very smart person. Who\u2019s Emma?\u201d<br>\u201cOh, uh, you remember Minsu?\u201d<br>You nodded, grinning. \u201cThe cutie.\u201d<br>He grinned a little. \u201cYeah. Emma is his mom. My former owner\u2019s sister. She\u2019s kind of like a surrogate mother for all of us. She was the first human I\u2019ve ever trusted completely. Then through her, her brother, my former owner.\u201d<br>Emma. Micheal. Jin.<br>\u201cWait, you mean Emma as in Em the head of the administration offices at the Sanctuary, and the founder of the Sanctuary with her brother Micheal who built the sanctuary and both of which were the main players in getting hybrid rights?\u201d<br>He nodded. \u201cYeah, we were adopted the day all of those laws passed that took away hybrid rights to get paid for work. They came in so she could officially adopt Jimin and Jungkook, and the worker, a decent guy, asked them to adopt us too. She adopted Hoseok because he volunteered, knowing we would all get separated eventually, Micheal adopted us. Me, Yoongi-hyung, and Taehyung-ssi. We stayed with her for a while before going to stay with Micheal.\u201d He spoke softly, almost reverently, as if speaking of sacred memories.<br>You understood. There were moments like that in your own life that felt sacred, like speaking of them could tear the world apart. \u201cSo, that boy you were with at the parade was one of the triplets?\u201d<br>He nodded again, smiling. \u201cYou know\u2026we\u2019re celebrating Christmas early with Micheal, Becca, and Timothy because there\u2019s a big hybrids rights thing that they\u2019re attending on Christmas. If you\u2019re not doing anything\u2026it\u2019d be kind of nice to introduce them to you. Taehyung\u2019s pretty sure I made you up.\u201d<br>\u201cYou move fast,\u201d You teased, an excited bounce to your step. \u201cI like it.\u201d<br>He smiled, but covered his mouth with an embarrassed laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re just\u2026\u201d<br>\u201cPerfect, flawless, strong, witty, beautiful,\u201d You listed, skipping ahead slightly so you could stop and look back. \u201cOr were you going to say I\u2019m just getting your wolf all riled up?\u201d<br>His gaze locked onto you and his shy smile turned into a confident smirk almost immediately. \u201cIf your tail was anything to go by, I\u2019d say you were the one getting riled up.\u201d<br>You flicked your hair over your shoulder and kept walking. \u201cIt\u2019s the snow. Knowing it\u2019ll end makes me want pups in the spring when prey is fat.\u201d<br>He caught up to you. \u201cOh? Are you often struck by this thought?\u201d<br>\u201cOnly when I\u2019m with handsome canines. Being with a handsome wolf, that\u2019s just got my mind going places it definitely shouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m recalling wives tales, mythology, biology\u2026\u201d <br>\u201cMammalogy and anatomy?\u201d He suggested the additions to the list as he claimed the spot around your waist with his arm.<br>You smirked up at him. \u201cSo you experience those thoughts too, good to know.\u201d<br>He laughed, and swung you around so that you were facing him and then he stooped slightly to kiss you. \u201cEveryone has those thoughts.\u201d<br>\u201cBut not everyone is as wild,\u201d You countered, tilting your head and blinking up slowly at him.<br>His eyes glittered with excitement and happiness. \u201cAre we going to fast? I mean\u2014\u201d<br>\u201cI instinctively like you, besides, with all the talking we did at the Thanksgiving parade and how we\u2019ve basically exchanged life stories now, I think it\u2019s pretty safe to say that even though we\u2019re moving fast we\u2019re not exactly missing important conversations. It\u2019s natural for hybrids to instinctively choose people for their mates, based on smell and small interactions. I mean, can you name five hybrids who dated for long periods of time before finally mating instead of breaking up with that person when they meet someone that they instinctively are more attracted to?\u201d You challenged.<br>He thought for a long time, then shook his head with a little laugh. \u201cI can\u2019t even name one.\u201d<br>\u201cI can name two, and it was more because of the circumstances around them than an actual hesitancy to mate with each other. This is natural. Besides, just the idea of imagining someone else\u2019s scent mixing with yours makes me want to commit crimes that would set back hybrid rights irreparably.\u201d You shuddered, fighting back the snarl that came up in your throat as you inadvertently imagined it. It was natural for the scents of those in his pack to be on him, they mixed in subtly with his own scent, a part of who he was. But if another female outside of his pack so much as touched him and left a ghosting of her scent you thought you might have to hunt her down to satisfy the primal urge in your stomach.<br>His phone rang in his pocket as he tipped your chin up toward him to kiss you, probably. He frowned and fished it out of his coat pocket, then he sighed. \u201cHang on, it\u2019s Jungkook-ssi.\u201d He walked away so he could talk.<br>You watched him for a moment, then pounced around, making more snow angels, your mind at ease with him nearby ensuring your safety. The air was crisp and clean, and the snow-laden trees created the perfect landscape for you to enjoy.<br>He dropped next to you and made a snow angel of his own, then got up and helped you up, laughing a little as he swept some snow from your hair and put his hat on your head. \u201cI have to go. Jungkook needs my help with some Christmas shopping and this is the only chance he\u2019s got to shop for the others. But, I\u2019ll pick you up? On Saturday? At ten?\u201d<br>You smiled and nodded, then went on tiptoe to kiss him. \u201cI look forward to it.\u201d<br>\u201cWe can have our own gift exchange another day, I promise,\u201d He murmured. \u201cAnd we should get together. Like, a lot.\u201d He placed a few kisses around your face, then wrapped his scarf around your neck, enveloping you in his scent, stealing your own scarf and wrapping it around his own neck.<br>You gazed up at him adoringly. \u201cOkay.\u201d<br>He kissed you again, then smiled and walked away, his coat covered in snow.<br>Your snow angel.</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><p><br></p><p><b><b><a href=\"https://writersrealmbts.tumblr.com/post/175143742856/masterlist\">Masterlist.</a> \u00a0 <b><b><a href=\"https://writersrealmbts.tumblr.com/post/180523511596/the-sanctuary-series\">Series Masterpost.</a>\u00a0 \u00a0<a href=\"https://writersrealmbts.tumblr.com/post/180323643401/cutie-pie\">Cutie Pie.</a>\u00a0 <a href=\"https://writersrealmbts.tumblr.com/post/181321540741/baby-its-cold-outside\">Baby, It\u2019s Cold Outside</a>.</b></b></b></b></p>",

Then you broke out of the forest and sighed as you collected yourself and walked confidently to work. You waved hello to Onew and Taemin, the security guards at the Sanctuary front gate, and headed out into the town. <br>Snow floated down, completely picturesque.<br>Until work came into sight and you had to remind yourself that work was necessary for food and that you could be doing worse jobs. Like that car-wash job you had two years ago where you almost got hypothermia everyday and eventually had to quit because you ended up getting bronchitis which almost turned into pneumonia. A different worker ended up suing the place and you ended up getting part of the payout, which went straight to your medical bills.<br>Trendy Tails was by far the best job you\u2019d ever had. You get clothing half-off and most of the hybrid customers remember when they weren\u2019t free and tend to be kinder to you. It\u2019s the young ones that make the day miserable because they act like entitled brats and make the wolf in you want to pin them down and show them that they can\u2019t even begin to act like they\u2019re over you. Only an alpha wolf could lord over you, and only within reason too. You were hardwired to follow your leader, protect them and the pack, and to help keep any challengers from rising in power, to bear pups for your leader and pack. You were also hardwired as a human to lead and be independent and question orders, to examine things with a set of morals all your own and decide if what you would be doing is truly good. The two actually combined well for once to create a mindset that helped you both lead and follow, to obey and question in accordance to the situation.<br>But for some reason work just made your wolf want to show all of these brats who was actually superior in the food chain. It may be petty, but some days you just felt that way.<br>That day quickly turned into one of those days as teenagers passed through. And preteens.<br>Not only did they leave the clothing in a mess, but they were loud and demanding and you had to report them to your boss for trying to shoplift.<br>Which of course ended up in you trying to avoid sneering at the teens backs when they gave you haughty looks when the police let them go.<br>Your day went downhill from there.<br>Some poor kid came in with his mom, and he was already complaining of not feeling well, but she ignored him and he ended up throwing up on the floor\u2026and some of the merchandise.<br>Your boss threw a fit over the merchandise while you were stuck cleaning up the floor and comforting the child after his mother scolded him and then went to talk with your boss about the items.<br>Poor little pup felt terrible, and you could help but notice that he had a bad fever as you wiped his face with some paper towel and he sobbed apologies to you.<br>You shushed him gently. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You weren\u2019t feeling good. It\u2019s not a big deal. Come on, we should tell your mom how bad you\u2019re feeling.\u201d You picked him up since he looked ready to collapse and carried him over. \u201cMa\u2019am!\u201d<br>Both your boss and the kids mom looked at you with annoyance.<br>\u201cYou should really take him to the doctor, he\u2019s got a pretty bad fever,\u201d You said, biting your lip.<br>Both of them felt his face and the mother slapped down some money before taking her son from your and hurrying out the door.<br>The rest of the cost came out of your pay. <br>You sprayed disinfectant everywhere, and managed to get the smell out of the place by the time the next customer came along.<br>Rude customers streamed through and you felt all of the happiness and cheerfulness from your morning turn into dust and blow away on the stifling breeze from the heating vent above your head.<br>\u201cI\u2019ve never been in here before, but I think I might like it,\u201d A man said from behind you.<br>You turned from where you were folding shirts, ready to reply something a little snarky since he was quite obviously hitting on you, only to stop and feel a smile start to spread.<br>Namjoon smirked at you. \u201cYou were about to tell me off, weren\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long day,\u201d You whispered, excitement starting to fill you. \u201cHi.\u201d<br>\u201cHi. Is there a reason you\u2019re whispering?\u201d<br>\u201cMy boss doesn\u2019t like me chatting up the customers,\u201d You replied, biting your lip to contain the energy that just seeing him brought you. This should definitely be enough to get you through the last half-hour of your shift.<br>He glanced around, then stepped in close and tucked his head into your neck the moment you tilted your head so he could. He breathed in your scent like it was a drug.<br>You were definitely addicted to him. \u201cWhat brings you to my neck of the woods? And after such a long time. I haven\u2019t seen you since the parade. I\u2019m not normally this forgiving.\u201d<br>He pulled back, looking at his feet in embarrassment and maybe guilt. \u201cI meant to come the next week, but I got pulled away by work. I\u2019m back now. I thought I would come see if you were still\u2026if we could still\u2026\u201d<br>You moved forward, placing a kiss on his cheek before nuzzling into his neck to breath in and drown in his scent. \u201cI get off work in half an hour. Want to go to the ice skating pond? I know it\u2019s not completely frozen but the path around there is still great.\u201d<br>His shoulders relaxed and he leaned his head on yours. \u201cI think I can kill some time in here. Go get back to work. I\u2019ll be watching.\u201d<br>You felt a sort of excited shiver go up your spine at the thought of him watching you, as if assessing you for compatibility, and you nodded firmly before turned and walking towards the next rack you had to straighten out with a bit of swing in your hips. That low throated growl that he quickly swallowed with an embarrassed and very forced cough was enough to have you grinning.<br>Your boss checked him out when he purchased something so you could finish straightening the last rack of tail-friendly lingerie. You were curious as to what he bought, but you couldn\u2019t see past the rack of adult footie pajamas.<br>Finally, you managed to clock out and get your stuff.<br>He was waiting outside, and grinned when you came rushing out to him. \u201cHey.\u201d<br>\u201cChristmas shopping?\u201d You asked, nodding toward the bag.<br>He nodded. \u201cI have a few people left still. This helps, though. Besides, I didn\u2019t want him to think I was loitering.\u201d He leaned down and kissed you.<br>It was as good as you remembered. Better even.<br>He wasn\u2019t holding back because of a small child that might look up at any moment. His hands freely felt your body, then slid through your hair, tugging gently to see your response.<br>You bit his lip playfully, then pulled away.<br>He looked so happy as he gazed at you, leading you with an arm around your waist toward the Sanctuary. \u201cYou looked like you were having a rough day before. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re able to smile like this now.\u201d<br>\u201cI\u2019m talking with another wolf. A handsome, kind man, with the best smile and I\u2019m about to go walk through nature with him. What happened earlier is just a bad dream.\u201d You smiled up at him, blinking cutely.<br>He kissed your eartip. \u201cAfter our walk we should get hot chocolate.\u201d<br>\u201cOr I could make you some hot chocolate,\u201d You offered. \u201cI made my own mix and I have whipped cream\u2026\u201d <br>His face looked a little red. \u201cUh, yeah. Whipped cream is\u2026good\u2026\u201d<br>You blinked rapidly, suppressing a grin. \u201cGet your mind out of the bedroom, alpha.\u201d<br>He turned completely red, looking at the sky. \u201cYou\u2019re shameless, aren\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\u201cHmm, you\u2019re the one who went right to the bedroom but I\u2019m the shameless one?\u201d You tucked your arm around him, breathing his scent in deeply. \u201cI love your scent. So nice.\u201d<br>He chuckled, seeming to relax with the change in conversation. \u201cYour smell is even better. Hey, do you ever find people looking at you because you just growled at a squirrel?\u201d<br>\u201cYes! And it\u2019s not something you can help, it\u2019s just such a strong instinct\u2026\u201d<br>He nodded, playfully biting your ear.<br>You squeak and duck out of his grasp, hopping onto his back.<br>He laughed and kept trudging forward, making sure you were secure on his back. \u201cI warn you now, I\u2019m kind of clumsy and tend to break things.\u201d<br>\u201cJust don\u2019t break me and I\u2019ll reward you in a very pleasant way,\u201d You told him in a whisper, kissing just below his ear and feeling the way he sort of melted under your touch. \u201cI promise.\u201d<br>He froze, then quickly pulled you off of his back and kissed you.<br>You smiled and when he let go you let yourself fall back into the snow, creating a snow angel.<br>He laughed and helped you up, carefully brushing the snow from your hair, then pressed kisses to your nose and cheeks. \u201cMy little snow angel. You love this weather, right?\u201d<br>\u201cMmhmm, especially if I\u2019m full. If I\u2019m hungry then the cold weather makes me anxious.\u201d<br>\u201cSame, it\u2019s that instinct that says that prey will be scarce.\u201d<br>\u201cRight. One year I didn\u2019t have enough time to get groceries, the moment I opened the pantry and saw only one pack of instant soup I went into full blown panic, ate the soup, rushed to the store and got enough groceries to last me two months. Owner came home and just stared at the hoard of food I had in my room while I just shivered in the middle of the bed. Blew her extra expenditures and grocery budget for the month. Took her two days to get me to let her take some of my food, kept growling and snarling at her. Don\u2019t remember anything after running to the store.\u201d You shook your head. \u201cAnyway, I always have emergency food now.\u201d<br>He laughed. \u201cI did that to myself once, but instead of running to the store, I ran to Emma and Jin\u2019s because that\u2019s where the majority of my pack could usually be found and where I knew there was food. Completely blacked out. When I came to, Jin had tied me up and was spoon-feeding me. The others were kind of stunned. Apparently I got close to one of the triplets in my\u2026whatever it was and when I wouldn\u2019t back away Jin forced me away. He\u2019s pack leader, but sometimes it\u2019s easy to forget because he\u2019s so\u2026gentle. He doesn\u2019t have a strong presence, but he\u2019s a leader in his own way. You\u2026mentioned an owner?\u201d<br>\u201cFormer owner. She never really wanted me, but I was a gift to her. She was kind to me, but when the laws changed she made it clear that I had to find a job and that as soon as I\u2019d saved up some money I had to find my own place to live. Much easier said than done. Jobs were still really scarce back then.\u201d<br>\u201cHow long did it take you to get enough money?\u201d<br>\u201cI got the money after moving out. Couldn\u2019t stay. Her boyfriend\u2026\u201d You shook your head to hide your shiver and the bile that rose in your throat.<br>Namjoon had stopped, turning you toward him. There was a strange glint in his eyes. \u201cDid he hurt you?\u201d<br>You looked away, frowning. \u201cHe never got far. I just couldn\u2019t stay in that environment with him. I ran the first time he laid a hand on me. He\u2019s lucky I didn\u2019t stab him with the kitchen scissors I was using at the time.\u201d You folded your arms as you thought about how much more satisfying it would have been to stab him in the arm with those kitchen scissors the moment he touched you. <br>\u201cHe\u2026\u201d Namjoon growled a little.<br>You smiled and slid your arms around his waist. \u201cI didn\u2019t let him do anything to me, Namjoon-ah. I\u2019m a little too aggressive when it comes to my own self defense. I jumped the gun and ended up on the streets for a while, then I came here. To the Sanctuary. Worked some low-level jobs to get my apartment at Haven and then got this job at the shop which isn\u2019t great but it gives me something to do and a living. It all worked out for the best. I met you, right? Another wolf\u2026\u201d You blinked up at him happily.<br>He looked down at you, then kissed you. \u201cYou know, before we were freed completely\u2026when my owner got married, I asked Emma about love. What it was like. She was in the early stages of her pregnancy and exhausted at the time. I asked her again, just a little while ago because I couldn\u2019t believe how much you\u2026struck me.\u201d<br>You looked away, continuing walking as he kept talking.<br>\u201cWe talked for a really long time. At the end of it, she said that being in a relationship with someone was knowing you would get hurt by them and that you would hurt them in return, but that the moments of pain were far outweighed by the moments of nursing each others wounds, fighting for each other, and working together against all other odds. And loving someone was looking at all the imperfections and seeing them as perfections because they\u2019re part of what makes that person who they are.\u201d<br>You smiled. \u201cShe sounds like a very smart person. Who\u2019s Emma?\u201d<br>\u201cOh, uh, you remember Minsu?\u201d<br>You nodded, grinning. \u201cThe cutie.\u201d<br>He grinned a little. \u201cYeah. Emma is his mom. My former owner\u2019s sister. She\u2019s kind of like a surrogate mother for all of us. She was the first human I\u2019ve ever trusted completely. Then through her, her brother, my former owner.\u201d<br>Emma. Micheal. Jin.<br>\u201cWait, you mean Emma as in Em the head of the administration offices at the Sanctuary, and the founder of the Sanctuary with her brother Micheal who built the sanctuary and both of which were the main players in getting hybrid rights?\u201d<br>He nodded. \u201cYeah, we were adopted the day all of those laws passed that took away hybrid rights to get paid for work. They came in so she could officially adopt Jimin and Jungkook, and the worker, a decent guy, asked them to adopt us too. She adopted Hoseok because he volunteered, knowing we would all get separated eventually, Micheal adopted us. Me, Yoongi-hyung, and Taehyung-ssi. We stayed with her for a while before going to stay with Micheal.\u201d He spoke softly, almost reverently, as if speaking of sacred memories.<br>You understood. There were moments like that in your own life that felt sacred, like speaking of them could tear the world apart. \u201cSo, that boy you were with at the parade was one of the triplets?\u201d<br>He nodded again, smiling. \u201cYou know\u2026we\u2019re celebrating Christmas early with Micheal, Becca, and Timothy because there\u2019s a big hybrids rights thing that they\u2019re attending on Christmas. If you\u2019re not doing anything\u2026it\u2019d be kind of nice to introduce them to you. Taehyung\u2019s pretty sure I made you up.\u201d<br>\u201cYou move fast,\u201d You teased, an excited bounce to your step. \u201cI like it.\u201d<br>He smiled, but covered his mouth with an embarrassed laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re just\u2026\u201d<br>\u201cPerfect, flawless, strong, witty, beautiful,\u201d You listed, skipping ahead slightly so you could stop and look back. \u201cOr were you going to say I\u2019m just getting your wolf all riled up?\u201d<br>His gaze locked onto you and his shy smile turned into a confident smirk almost immediately. \u201cIf your tail was anything to go by, I\u2019d say you were the one getting riled up.\u201d<br>You flicked your hair over your shoulder and kept walking. \u201cIt\u2019s the snow. Knowing it\u2019ll end makes me want pups in the spring when prey is fat.\u201d<br>He caught up to you. \u201cOh? Are you often struck by this thought?\u201d<br>\u201cOnly when I\u2019m with handsome canines. Being with a handsome wolf, that\u2019s just got my mind going places it definitely shouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m recalling wives tales, mythology, biology\u2026\u201d <br>\u201cMammalogy and anatomy?\u201d He suggested the additions to the list as he claimed the spot around your waist with his arm.<br>You smirked up at him. \u201cSo you experience those thoughts too, good to know.\u201d<br>He laughed, and swung you around so that you were facing him and then he stooped slightly to kiss you. \u201cEveryone has those thoughts.\u201d<br>\u201cBut not everyone is as wild,\u201d You countered, tilting your head and blinking up slowly at him.<br>His eyes glittered with excitement and happiness. \u201cAre we going to fast? I mean\u2014\u201d<br>\u201cI instinctively like you, besides, with all the talking we did at the Thanksgiving parade and how we\u2019ve basically exchanged life stories now, I think it\u2019s pretty safe to say that even though we\u2019re moving fast we\u2019re not exactly missing important conversations. It\u2019s natural for hybrids to instinctively choose people for their mates, based on smell and small interactions. I mean, can you name five hybrids who dated for long periods of time before finally mating instead of breaking up with that person when they meet someone that they instinctively are more attracted to?\u201d You challenged.<br>He thought for a long time, then shook his head with a little laugh. \u201cI can\u2019t even name one.\u201d<br>\u201cI can name two, and it was more because of the circumstances around them than an actual hesitancy to mate with each other. This is natural. Besides, just the idea of imagining someone else\u2019s scent mixing with yours makes me want to commit crimes that would set back hybrid rights irreparably.\u201d You shuddered, fighting back the snarl that came up in your throat as you inadvertently imagined it. It was natural for the scents of those in his pack to be on him, they mixed in subtly with his own scent, a part of who he was. But if another female outside of his pack so much as touched him and left a ghosting of her scent you thought you might have to hunt her down to satisfy the primal urge in your stomach.<br>His phone rang in his pocket as he tipped your chin up toward him to kiss you, probably. He frowned and fished it out of his coat pocket, then he sighed. \u201cHang on, it\u2019s Jungkook-ssi.\u201d He walked away so he could talk.<br>You watched him for a moment, then pounced around, making more snow angels, your mind at ease with him nearby ensuring your safety. The air was crisp and clean, and the snow-laden trees created the perfect landscape for you to enjoy.<br>He dropped next to you and made a snow angel of his own, then got up and helped you up, laughing a little as he swept some snow from your hair and put his hat on your head. \u201cI have to go. Jungkook needs my help with some Christmas shopping and this is the only chance he\u2019s got to shop for the others. But, I\u2019ll pick you up? On Saturday? At ten?\u201d<br>You smiled and nodded, then went on tiptoe to kiss him. \u201cI look forward to it.\u201d<br>\u201cWe can have our own gift exchange another day, I promise,\u201d He murmured. \u201cAnd we should get together. Like, a lot.\u201d He placed a few kisses around your face, then wrapped his scarf around your neck, enveloping you in his scent, stealing your own scarf and wrapping it around his own neck.<br>You gazed up at him adoringly. \u201cOkay.\u201d<br>He kissed you again, then smiled and walked away, his coat covered in snow.<br>Your snow angel.</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><p><br></p><p><b><b><a href=\"https://writersrealmbts.tumblr.com/post/175143742856/masterlist\">Masterlist.</a> \u00a0 <b><b><a href=\"https://writersrealmbts.tumblr.com/post/180523511596/the-sanctuary-series\">Series Masterpost.</a>\u00a0 \u00a0<a href=\"https://writersrealmbts.tumblr.com/post/180323643401/cutie-pie\">Cutie Pie.</a>\u00a0 <a href=\"https://writersrealmbts.tumblr.com/post/181321540741/baby-its-cold-outside\">Baby, It\u2019s Cold Outside</a>.</b></b></b></b></p>",

Then you broke out of the forest and sighed as you collected yourself and walked confidently to work. You waved hello to Onew and Taemin, the security guards at the Sanctuary front gate, and headed out into the town. <br />Snow floated down, completely picturesque.<br />Until work came into sight and you had to remind yourself that work was necessary for food and that you could be doing worse jobs. Like that car-wash job you had two years ago where you almost got hypothermia everyday and eventually had to quit because you ended up getting bronchitis which almost turned into pneumonia. A different worker ended up suing the place and you ended up getting part of the payout, which went straight to your medical bills.<br />Trendy Tails was by far the best job you&rsquo;d ever had. You get clothing half-off and most of the hybrid customers remember when they weren&rsquo;t free and tend to be kinder to you. It&rsquo;s the young ones that make the day miserable because they act like entitled brats and make the wolf in you want to pin them down and show them that they can&rsquo;t even begin to act like they&rsquo;re over you. Only an alpha wolf could lord over you, and only within reason too. You were hardwired to follow your leader, protect them and the pack, and to help keep any challengers from rising in power, to bear pups for your leader and pack. You were also hardwired as a human to lead and be independent and question orders, to examine things with a set of morals all your own and decide if what you would be doing is truly good. The two actually combined well for once to create a mindset that helped you both lead and follow, to obey and question in accordance to the situation.<br />But for some reason work just made your wolf want to show all of these brats who was actually superior in the food chain. It may be petty, but some days you just felt that way.<br />That day quickly turned into one of those days as teenagers passed through. And preteens.<br />Not only did they leave the clothing in a mess, but they were loud and demanding and you had to report them to your boss for trying to shoplift.<br />Which of course ended up in you trying to avoid sneering at the teens backs when they gave you haughty looks when the police let them go.<br />Your day went downhill from there.<br />Some poor kid came in with his mom, and he was already complaining of not feeling well, but she ignored him and he ended up throwing up on the floor&hellip;and some of the merchandise.<br />Your boss threw a fit over the merchandise while you were stuck cleaning up the floor and comforting the child after his mother scolded him and then went to talk with your boss about the items.<br />Poor little pup felt terrible, and you could help but notice that he had a bad fever as you wiped his face with some paper towel and he sobbed apologies to you.<br />You shushed him gently. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. You weren&rsquo;t feeling good. It&rsquo;s not a big deal. Come on, we should tell your mom how bad you&rsquo;re feeling.&rdquo; You picked him up since he looked ready to collapse and carried him over. &ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo;<br />Both your boss and the kids mom looked at you with annoyance.<br />&ldquo;You should really take him to the doctor, he&rsquo;s got a pretty bad fever,&rdquo; You said, biting your lip.<br />Both of them felt his face and the mother slapped down some money before taking her son from your and hurrying out the door.<br />The rest of the cost came out of your pay. <br />You sprayed disinfectant everywhere, and managed to get the smell out of the place by the time the next customer came along.<br />Rude customers streamed through and you felt all of the happiness and cheerfulness from your morning turn into dust and blow away on the stifling breeze from the heating vent above your head.<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been in here before, but I think I might like it,&rdquo; A man said from behind you.<br />You turned from where you were folding shirts, ready to reply something a little snarky since he was quite obviously hitting on you, only to stop and feel a smile start to spread.<br />Namjoon smirked at you. &ldquo;You were about to tell me off, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a long day,&rdquo; You whispered, excitement starting to fill you. &ldquo;Hi.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Hi. Is there a reason you&rsquo;re whispering?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;My boss doesn&rsquo;t like me chatting up the customers,&rdquo; You replied, biting your lip to contain the energy that just seeing him brought you. This should definitely be enough to get you through the last half-hour of your shift.<br />He glanced around, then stepped in close and tucked his head into your neck the moment you tilted your head so he could. He breathed in your scent like it was a drug.<br />You were definitely addicted to him. &ldquo;What brings you to my neck of the woods? And after such a long time. I haven&rsquo;t seen you since the parade. I&rsquo;m not normally this forgiving.&rdquo;<br />He pulled back, looking at his feet in embarrassment and maybe guilt. &ldquo;I meant to come the next week, but I got pulled away by work. I&rsquo;m back now. I thought I would come see if you were still&hellip;if we could still&hellip;&rdquo;<br />You moved forward, placing a kiss on his cheek before nuzzling into his neck to breath in and drown in his scent. &ldquo;I get off work in half an hour. Want to go to the ice skating pond? I know it&rsquo;s not completely frozen but the path around there is still great.&rdquo;<br />His shoulders relaxed and he leaned his head on yours. &ldquo;I think I can kill some time in here. Go get back to work. I&rsquo;ll be watching.&rdquo;<br />You felt a sort of excited shiver go up your spine at the thought of him watching you, as if assessing you for compatibility, and you nodded firmly before turned and walking towards the next rack you had to straighten out with a bit of swing in your hips. That low throated growl that he quickly swallowed with an embarrassed and very forced cough was enough to have you grinning.<br />Your boss checked him out when he purchased something so you could finish straightening the last rack of tail-friendly lingerie. You were curious as to what he bought, but you couldn&rsquo;t see past the rack of adult footie pajamas.<br />Finally, you managed to clock out and get your stuff.<br />He was waiting outside, and grinned when you came rushing out to him. &ldquo;Hey.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Christmas shopping?&rdquo; You asked, nodding toward the bag.<br />He nodded. &ldquo;I have a few people left still. This helps, though. Besides, I didn&rsquo;t want him to think I was loitering.&rdquo; He leaned down and kissed you.<br />It was as good as you remembered. Better even.<br />He wasn&rsquo;t holding back because of a small child that might look up at any moment. His hands freely felt your body, then slid through your hair, tugging gently to see your response.<br />You bit his lip playfully, then pulled away.<br />He looked so happy as he gazed at you, leading you with an arm around your waist toward the Sanctuary. &ldquo;You looked like you were having a rough day before. I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re able to smile like this now.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m talking with another wolf. A handsome, kind man, with the best smile and I&rsquo;m about to go walk through nature with him. What happened earlier is just a bad dream.&rdquo; You smiled up at him, blinking cutely.<br />He kissed your eartip. &ldquo;After our walk we should get hot chocolate.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Or I could make you some hot chocolate,&rdquo; You offered. &ldquo;I made my own mix and I have whipped cream&hellip;&rdquo; <br />His face looked a little red. &ldquo;Uh, yeah. Whipped cream is&hellip;good&hellip;&rdquo;<br />You blinked rapidly, suppressing a grin. &ldquo;Get your mind out of the bedroom, alpha.&rdquo;<br />He turned completely red, looking at the sky. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re shameless, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Hmm, you&rsquo;re the one who went right to the bedroom but I&rsquo;m the shameless one?&rdquo; You tucked your arm around him, breathing his scent in deeply. &ldquo;I love your scent. So nice.&rdquo;<br />He chuckled, seeming to relax with the change in conversation. &ldquo;Your smell is even better. Hey, do you ever find people looking at you because you just growled at a squirrel?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Yes! And it&rsquo;s not something you can help, it&rsquo;s just such a strong instinct&hellip;&rdquo;<br />He nodded, playfully biting your ear.<br />You squeak and duck out of his grasp, hopping onto his back.<br />He laughed and kept trudging forward, making sure you were secure on his back. &ldquo;I warn you now, I&rsquo;m kind of clumsy and tend to break things.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t break me and I&rsquo;ll reward you in a very pleasant way,&rdquo; You told him in a whisper, kissing just below his ear and feeling the way he sort of melted under your touch. &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;<br />He froze, then quickly pulled you off of his back and kissed you.<br />You smiled and when he let go you let yourself fall back into the snow, creating a snow angel.<br />He laughed and helped you up, carefully brushing the snow from your hair, then pressed kisses to your nose and cheeks. &ldquo;My little snow angel. You love this weather, right?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Mmhmm, especially if I&rsquo;m full. If I&rsquo;m hungry then the cold weather makes me anxious.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Same, it&rsquo;s that instinct that says that prey will be scarce.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Right. One year I didn&rsquo;t have enough time to get groceries, the moment I opened the pantry and saw only one pack of instant soup I went into full blown panic, ate the soup, rushed to the store and got enough groceries to last me two months. Owner came home and just stared at the hoard of food I had in my room while I just shivered in the middle of the bed. Blew her extra expenditures and grocery budget for the month. Took her two days to get me to let her take some of my food, kept growling and snarling at her. Don&rsquo;t remember anything after running to the store.&rdquo; You shook your head. &ldquo;Anyway, I always have emergency food now.&rdquo;<br />He laughed. &ldquo;I did that to myself once, but instead of running to the store, I ran to Emma and Jin&rsquo;s because that&rsquo;s where the majority of my pack could usually be found and where I knew there was food. Completely blacked out. When I came to, Jin had tied me up and was spoon-feeding me. The others were kind of stunned. Apparently I got close to one of the triplets in my&hellip;whatever it was and when I wouldn&rsquo;t back away Jin forced me away. He&rsquo;s pack leader, but sometimes it&rsquo;s easy to forget because he&rsquo;s so&hellip;gentle. He doesn&rsquo;t have a strong presence, but he&rsquo;s a leader in his own way. You&hellip;mentioned an owner?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Former owner. She never really wanted me, but I was a gift to her. She was kind to me, but when the laws changed she made it clear that I had to find a job and that as soon as I&rsquo;d saved up some money I had to find my own place to live. Much easier said than done. Jobs were still really scarce back then.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;How long did it take you to get enough money?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I got the money after moving out. Couldn&rsquo;t stay. Her boyfriend&hellip;&rdquo; You shook your head to hide your shiver and the bile that rose in your throat.<br />Namjoon had stopped, turning you toward him. There was a strange glint in his eyes. &ldquo;Did he hurt you?&rdquo;<br />You looked away, frowning. &ldquo;He never got far. I just couldn&rsquo;t stay in that environment with him. I ran the first time he laid a hand on me. He&rsquo;s lucky I didn&rsquo;t stab him with the kitchen scissors I was using at the time.&rdquo; You folded your arms as you thought about how much more satisfying it would have been to stab him in the arm with those kitchen scissors the moment he touched you. <br />&ldquo;He&hellip;&rdquo; Namjoon growled a little.<br />You smiled and slid your arms around his waist. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t let him do anything to me, Namjoon-ah. I&rsquo;m a little too aggressive when it comes to my own self defense. I jumped the gun and ended up on the streets for a while, then I came here. To the Sanctuary. Worked some low-level jobs to get my apartment at Haven and then got this job at the shop which isn&rsquo;t great but it gives me something to do and a living. It all worked out for the best. I met you, right? Another wolf&hellip;&rdquo; You blinked up at him happily.<br />He looked down at you, then kissed you. &ldquo;You know, before we were freed completely&hellip;when my owner got married, I asked Emma about love. What it was like. She was in the early stages of her pregnancy and exhausted at the time. I asked her again, just a little while ago because I couldn&rsquo;t believe how much you&hellip;struck me.&rdquo;<br />You looked away, continuing walking as he kept talking.<br />&ldquo;We talked for a really long time. At the end of it, she said that being in a relationship with someone was knowing you would get hurt by them and that you would hurt them in return, but that the moments of pain were far outweighed by the moments of nursing each others wounds, fighting for each other, and working together against all other odds. And loving someone was looking at all the imperfections and seeing them as perfections because they&rsquo;re part of what makes that person who they are.&rdquo;<br />You smiled. &ldquo;She sounds like a very smart person. Who&rsquo;s Emma?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Oh, uh, you remember Minsu?&rdquo;<br />You nodded, grinning. &ldquo;The cutie.&rdquo;<br />He grinned a little. &ldquo;Yeah. Emma is his mom. My former owner&rsquo;s sister. She&rsquo;s kind of like a surrogate mother for all of us. She was the first human I&rsquo;ve ever trusted completely. Then through her, her brother, my former owner.&rdquo;<br />Emma. Micheal. Jin.<br />&ldquo;Wait, you mean Emma as in Em the head of the administration offices at the Sanctuary, and the founder of the Sanctuary with her brother Micheal who built the sanctuary and both of which were the main players in getting hybrid rights?&rdquo;<br />He nodded. &ldquo;Yeah, we were adopted the day all of those laws passed that took away hybrid rights to get paid for work. They came in so she could officially adopt Jimin and Jungkook, and the worker, a decent guy, asked them to adopt us too. She adopted Hoseok because he volunteered, knowing we would all get separated eventually, Micheal adopted us. Me, Yoongi-hyung, and Taehyung-ssi. We stayed with her for a while before going to stay with Micheal.&rdquo; He spoke softly, almost reverently, as if speaking of sacred memories.<br />You understood. There were moments like that in your own life that felt sacred, like speaking of them could tear the world apart. &ldquo;So, that boy you were with at the parade was one of the triplets?&rdquo;<br />He nodded again, smiling. &ldquo;You know&hellip;we&rsquo;re celebrating Christmas early with Micheal, Becca, and Timothy because there&rsquo;s a big hybrids rights thing that they&rsquo;re attending on Christmas. If you&rsquo;re not doing anything&hellip;it&rsquo;d be kind of nice to introduce them to you. Taehyung&rsquo;s pretty sure I made you up.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;You move fast,&rdquo; You teased, an excited bounce to your step. &ldquo;I like it.&rdquo;<br />He smiled, but covered his mouth with an embarrassed laugh. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just&hellip;&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Perfect, flawless, strong, witty, beautiful,&rdquo; You listed, skipping ahead slightly so you could stop and look back. &ldquo;Or were you going to say I&rsquo;m just getting your wolf all riled up?&rdquo;<br />His gaze locked onto you and his shy smile turned into a confident smirk almost immediately. &ldquo;If your tail was anything to go by, I&rsquo;d say you were the one getting riled up.&rdquo;<br />You flicked your hair over your shoulder and kept walking. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the snow. Knowing it&rsquo;ll end makes me want pups in the spring when prey is fat.&rdquo;<br />He caught up to you. &ldquo;Oh? Are you often struck by this thought?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Only when I&rsquo;m with handsome canines. Being with a handsome wolf, that&rsquo;s just got my mind going places it definitely shouldn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m recalling wives tales, mythology, biology&hellip;&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;Mammalogy and anatomy?&rdquo; He suggested the additions to the list as he claimed the spot around your waist with his arm.<br />You smirked up at him. &ldquo;So you experience those thoughts too, good to know.&rdquo;<br />He laughed, and swung you around so that you were facing him and then he stooped slightly to kiss you. &ldquo;Everyone has those thoughts.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;But not everyone is as wild,&rdquo; You countered, tilting your head and blinking up slowly at him.<br />His eyes glittered with excitement and happiness. &ldquo;Are we going to fast?

The air was crisp and clean, and the snow-laden trees created the perfect landscape for you to enjoy.<br />He dropped next to you and made a snow angel of his own, then got up and helped you up, laughing a little as he swept some snow from your hair and put his hat on your head. &ldquo;I have to go.

Tell us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>You were only gone for a couple minutes but when you get back from the bathroom, the other six have your boyfriend pinned against the couch. His face is redder than his hair as he squirms against them. It\u2019s no use. Jimin pops his head up from where he sits straddling the poor boy.</p><p>\u201cY/N-ah!\u201d he exclaims and suddenly five other pairs of eyes are on you. You feel yourself shrinking back again through the doorway. \u201cTaetae won\u2019t tell us what happened last year after the Christmas party!\u201d</p><p>Taehyung wrenches his arm out of Hoseok\u2019s grasp and throws his hand toward you. \u201cY/N, run while you can!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter the Christmas party\u2026\u201d you repeat thoughtfully. \u201cOh!\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014you mean The Eggnog Incident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTraitor!\u201d Taehyung yells dramatically and thrashes even harder.</p><!-- more --><p>You can\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cOh, come on, Tae. It was hilarious.\u201d</p><p>At last your boyfriend is able to throw his hips to the side, sending Jimin tumbling off the couch and onto the floor. He pulls his other hand out of Jin\u2019s grasp and kicks at the other three until they let go of his ankles. Then he scrambles up off the couch and out of reach. He comes to stand beside you in full-on pout mode.</p><p>\u201cI think you mean embarrassing,\u201d he utters and crosses his arms over his chest.</p><p>\u201cCome on, hyung,\u201d Jungkook says falling down onto the couch beside Jimin, \u201cyou can\u2019t refer to it as \u2018The Eggnog Incident\u2019 and then not tell us about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>I</i> didn\u2019t refer to it as anything,\u201d Taehyung responds, throwing a glare your way.</p><p>You cringe. \u201cHow was I supposed to know you didn\u2019t want to tell them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe because they were literally holding me down trying to get me to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Taeyhungie,\u201d Yoongi says as he sinks down into the armchair closest to their Christmas tree. \u201cIt\u2019s going to come out eventually. You can\u2019t keep secrets in this house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially not at the annual Christmas party,\u201d Hoseok chimes in and raises his glass of eggnog up in agreement. \u201cCome on, Taetae. Story time.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung looks at you again and pulls his lips in between his teeth as a way of symbolically sealing them. Again, everyone else turns to look at you.</p><p>\u201cYoongi\u2019s right, Tae,\u201d you say looking back at your boyfriend. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna come out eventually.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung shakes his head.</p><p>You let out a sigh. \u201cCome on, guys. He doesn\u2019t want to tell. It\u2019s just something stupid he did after accidentally drinking a \u00a0bunch of spiked eggnog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you accidentally drink spiked eggnog?\u201d Namjoon asks narrowing his eyes and looking down at his own glass of the holiday drink.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was spiked,\u201d Taehyung utters.</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t taste the alcohol?\u201d Jimin asks in disbelief.</p><p>Taehyung shrugs. \u201cI\u2019d never had it before.\u201d Then he turns to you. \u201cI learned my lesson, though. So what happened last year will never happen again. And <i>never</i> needs to be spoken about.\u201d</p><p>Jimin lifts Jungkook\u2019s arm off from around his neck where the maknae had slung it a few minutes earlier and gets up off the couch. \u201cAlright, that\u2019s it,\u201d he says and sets his own drink down on the coffee table. \u201cIf you don\u2019t tell us what happened, Y/N is getting tickled to death.\u201d</p><p>Your eyes go wide as the others follow after Jimin. They can\u2019t be serious. But then they start creeping closer. You open your mouth and suck in a deep breath. \u201cIT ALL STARTED\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, wait, wait,\u201d Taehyung says stepping in front of you protectively.</p><p>The rest of the boys watch him with expectant smiles and he twists his neck around to look at you. \u201cYou owe me big time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust sit yourselves back down. No one needs to tickle Y/N.\u201d Then he sighs. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you about The Eggnog Incident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019d rather hear it from Y/N,\u201d Namjoon says with a wink. \u201cI have a feeling you\u2019d skip out on some important details.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung looks at you again and gives a defeated shrug. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>You take a deep breath and step forward. \u201cWell, it all started at last year\u2019s Christmas party\u2026\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve had enough, Tae,\u201d you giggled curling your finger around the handle of your boyfriend\u2019s cup. He wrenched it out of your grip with a loud laugh.</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d he yelled, his voice cracking. \u201cHave you tried this? I\u2019ve never had eggnog before. Why have I never tried eggnog? This. Stuff. Is. Amazing.\u201d With every word, he jabbed his cup forward against your arm, the creamy liquid sloshing out onto your sweater and the carpet.</p><p>\u201cI have tried it, actually,\u201d you replied. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think that\u2019s regular eggnog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s not regular eggnog. It\u2019s <i>delicious</i> eggnog.\u201d Then he threw his head back, draining the last bit of it and ran his tongue along his top lip to catch the last drop. \u201cI have an idea.\u201d Before you could even ask what it was, he grabbed your arm and tugged you out of the room. \u201cBye, guys!\u201d he yelled back to his six bandmates. </p><p>You could hear their goodbyes and confused questions fade away as the two of you bounded down the hall and out the door. The building that housed BigHit Entertainment was eerily quiet and the sound of Taehyung\u2019s inebriated laughter echoed down the halls as he pulled you along. Finally, the two of you burst through the front doors and out into the frigid night. </p><p>Christmas was the following week and it looked to you like it was going to be a white one. Snow had been falling almost continuously for the past several days and didn\u2019t seem to be letting up any time soon. The city was doing a fine job at keeping the roads plowed but that meant giant piles had been accumulating along the paths and sidewalks. The whole city was turning into one big snowy labyrinth. You\u2019d barely managed to grab your coat before Taehyung had tugged you out the door but now you wrapped it around yourself, thankful you had thought of the possibility that this brilliant idea of his meant going outside.</p><p>Now you stood on the sidewalk, admiring the way the street lamps reflected off the thin layer of frost covering everything and making it sparkle. You didn\u2019t even notice Taehyung wasn\u2019t beside you anymore until you turned to ask him what his idea was only to find he was gone. You twisted your neck left and right but he was nowhere to be found. </p><p>\u201cTae?\u201d you called out into the darkness. When he didn\u2019t respond, you cursed yourself for not thinking to text his manager to accompany the two of you. A member of the most popular boyband in the world was drunk and running loose in the city. There was no way this was going to end well. You plunged your hand into your pocket to grab your phone only to find that it wasn\u2019t there. Crap. You knew exactly where it was. Sitting on the counter in the kitchen charging back up in the dorm. Should you run back in and get it? The more time you wasted, the farther away Taehyung was going to wander. You couldn\u2019t risk it.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung!\u201d you called as you made your way carefully across the icy street. </p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d</p><p>Thank God. You spun in the direction you heard his voice only to find him waving back at you from two blocks down. \u201cHow\u2019d you get all the way down there?\u201d you called as you stumbled after him. </p><p>\u201cPretend like you\u2019re ice skating!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suck at ice skating!\u201d you yelled back, bravely breaking into a slow trot. Luckily, you managed to stay upright until you reached your boyfriend, though your slightly faster than walking speed on the slick pavement made it impossible for you to stop and you ended up slamming into his chest. You clung to him until you regained your balance, that being rather difficult because neither of you could stop laughing. At last you were able to pull away from him. And, of course, when you did, he broke away again.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Y/N!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTae, stop running!\u201d you yelled back and then let out a frustrated groan. \u201cTae, slow down!\u201d</p><p>He was halfway across a large field, heading toward city park when he spun back around. \u201cAre you hot, Y/N?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m in a sauna!\u201d Then to your horror, he pulled off his thick coat and then proceeded to yank his shirt off over his head.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung!\u201d you yelled and broke back into a run as he started unbuttoning his pants. \u201cLeave your clothes on! Are you crazy? You\u2019re going to freeze!\u201d</p><p>Luckily, he stopped trying to take his pants off when he saw you coming after him, instead deciding you were now playing a game of tag. \u201cCan\u2019t catch me!\u201d he yelled then took off sprinting toward the park. Now that his pants were unbuttoned, they hung loosely from his hips, sliding further down with each stride of his long legs. </p><p>\u201cTaehyung!\u201d you called and bent down to scoop up his coat and shirt. \u201cGet back here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to catch me!\u201d he called back then disappeared into the trees surrounding the park.</p><p>This was not good. Not good at all. </p><p>It took you a few more minutes to get into the park and when you finally did, the light from the lamp posts didn\u2019t really reach more than a few meters off the main walkway.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung!\u201d you called into the darkness. Panic began to set in as you clutched his clothes tightly to your chest. \u201cTaehyung! This isn\u2019t funny!\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d he called from down the path. You could hear a faint rhythm begin to grow from the distance. It sounded strange. Like footsteps but much heavier and much sharper than a regular person would make. \u201cY/N! Look what I found!\u201d Taehyung\u2019s voice came again, overlapping the odd rhythm. But then the sounds made perfect sense and your eyes widened as a horse and carriage came into view around the ben. The person at the reigns was none other than your boyfriend in all of his half-naked glory.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYou stole a sleigh?\u201d Jin screams and throws his head back in laughter.</p><p>The others are already long gone, howling and clutching their stomachs at the mention of Taehyung\u2019s drunken antics. Your poor boyfriend is still leaning against the wall behind you, his face turning a shade of red that\u2019s several darker than his hair.

He pulls his other hand out of Jin\u2019s grasp and kicks at the other three until they let go of his ankles. Then he scrambles up off the couch and out of reach. He comes to stand beside you in full-on pout mode.</p><p>\u201cI think you mean embarrassing,\u201d he utters and crosses his arms over his chest.</p><p>\u201cCome on, hyung,\u201d Jungkook says falling down onto the couch beside Jimin, \u201cyou can\u2019t refer to it as \u2018The Eggnog Incident\u2019 and then not tell us about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>I</i> didn\u2019t refer to it as anything,\u201d Taehyung responds, throwing a glare your way.</p><p>You cringe. \u201cHow was I supposed to know you didn\u2019t want to tell them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe because they were literally holding me down trying to get me to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Taeyhungie,\u201d Yoongi says as he sinks down into the armchair closest to their Christmas tree. \u201cIt\u2019s going to come out eventually. You can\u2019t keep secrets in this house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially not at the annual Christmas party,\u201d Hoseok chimes in and raises his glass of eggnog up in agreement. \u201cCome on, Taetae. Story time.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung looks at you again and pulls his lips in between his teeth as a way of symbolically sealing them. Again, everyone else turns to look at you.</p><p>\u201cYoongi\u2019s right, Tae,\u201d you say looking back at your boyfriend. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna come out eventually.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung shakes his head.</p><p>You let out a sigh. \u201cCome on, guys. He doesn\u2019t want to tell. It\u2019s just something stupid he did after accidentally drinking a \u00a0bunch of spiked eggnog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you accidentally drink spiked eggnog?\u201d Namjoon asks narrowing his eyes and looking down at his own glass of the holiday drink.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was spiked,\u201d Taehyung utters.</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t taste the alcohol?\u201d Jimin asks in disbelief.</p><p>Taehyung shrugs. \u201cI\u2019d never had it before.\u201d Then he turns to you. \u201cI learned my lesson, though. So what happened last year will never happen again. And <i>never</i> needs to be spoken about.\u201d</p><p>Jimin lifts Jungkook\u2019s arm off from around his neck where the maknae had slung it a few minutes earlier and gets up off the couch. \u201cAlright, that\u2019s it,\u201d he says and sets his own drink down on the coffee table. \u201cIf you don\u2019t tell us what happened, Y/N is getting tickled to death.\u201d</p><p>Your eyes go wide as the others follow after Jimin. They can\u2019t be serious. But then they start creeping closer. You open your mouth and suck in a deep breath. \u201cIT ALL STARTED\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, wait, wait,\u201d Taehyung says stepping in front of you protectively.</p><p>The rest of the boys watch him with expectant smiles and he twists his neck around to look at you. \u201cYou owe me big time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust sit yourselves back down. No one needs to tickle Y/N.\u201d Then he sighs. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you about The Eggnog Incident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019d rather hear it from Y/N,\u201d Namjoon says with a wink. \u201cI have a feeling you\u2019d skip out on some important details.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung looks at you again and gives a defeated shrug. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>You take a deep breath and step forward. \u201cWell, it all started at last year\u2019s Christmas party\u2026\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve had enough, Tae,\u201d you giggled curling your finger around the handle of your boyfriend\u2019s cup. He wrenched it out of your grip with a loud laugh.</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d he yelled, his voice cracking. \u201cHave you tried this? I\u2019ve never had eggnog before. Why have I never tried eggnog? This. Stuff. Is. Amazing.\u201d With every word, he jabbed his cup forward against your arm, the creamy liquid sloshing out onto your sweater and the carpet.</p><p>\u201cI have tried it, actually,\u201d you replied. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think that\u2019s regular eggnog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s not regular eggnog. It\u2019s <i>delicious</i> eggnog.\u201d Then he threw his head back, draining the last bit of it and ran his tongue along his top lip to catch the last drop. \u201cI have an idea.\u201d Before you could even ask what it was, he grabbed your arm and tugged you out of the room. \u201cBye, guys!\u201d he yelled back to his six bandmates. </p><p>You could hear their goodbyes and confused questions fade away as the two of you bounded down the hall and out the door. The building that housed BigHit Entertainment was eerily quiet and the sound of Taehyung\u2019s inebriated laughter echoed down the halls as he pulled you along. Finally, the two of you burst through the front doors and out into the frigid night. </p><p>Christmas was the following week and it looked to you like it was going to be a white one. Snow had been falling almost continuously for the past several days and didn\u2019t seem to be letting up any time soon. The city was doing a fine job at keeping the roads plowed but that meant giant piles had been accumulating along the paths and sidewalks. The whole city was turning into one big snowy labyrinth. You\u2019d barely managed to grab your coat before Taehyung had tugged you out the door but now you wrapped it around yourself, thankful you had thought of the possibility that this brilliant idea of his meant going outside.</p><p>Now you stood on the sidewalk, admiring the way the street lamps reflected off the thin layer of frost covering everything and making it sparkle. You didn\u2019t even notice Taehyung wasn\u2019t beside you anymore until you turned to ask him what his idea was only to find he was gone. You twisted your neck left and right but he was nowhere to be found. </p><p>\u201cTae?\u201d you called out into the darkness. When he didn\u2019t respond, you cursed yourself for not thinking to text his manager to accompany the two of you. A member of the most popular boyband in the world was drunk and running loose in the city. There was no way this was going to end well. You plunged your hand into your pocket to grab your phone only to find that it wasn\u2019t there. Crap. You knew exactly where it was. Sitting on the counter in the kitchen charging back up in the dorm. Should you run back in and get it? The more time you wasted, the farther away Taehyung was going to wander. You couldn\u2019t risk it.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung!\u201d you called as you made your way carefully across the icy street. </p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d</p><p>Thank God. You spun in the direction you heard his voice only to find him waving back at you from two blocks down. \u201cHow\u2019d you get all the way down there?\u201d you called as you stumbled after him. </p><p>\u201cPretend like you\u2019re ice skating!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suck at ice skating!\u201d you yelled back, bravely breaking into a slow trot. Luckily, you managed to stay upright until you reached your boyfriend, though your slightly faster than walking speed on the slick pavement made it impossible for you to stop and you ended up slamming into his chest. You clung to him until you regained your balance, that being rather difficult because neither of you could stop laughing. At last you were able to pull away from him. And, of course, when you did, he broke away again.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Y/N!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTae, stop running!\u201d you yelled back and then let out a frustrated groan. \u201cTae, slow down!\u201d</p><p>He was halfway across a large field, heading toward city park when he spun back around. \u201cAre you hot, Y/N?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m in a sauna!\u201d Then to your horror, he pulled off his thick coat and then proceeded to yank his shirt off over his head.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung!\u201d you yelled and broke back into a run as he started unbuttoning his pants. \u201cLeave your clothes on! Are you crazy? You\u2019re going to freeze!\u201d</p><p>Luckily, he stopped trying to take his pants off when he saw you coming after him, instead deciding you were now playing a game of tag. \u201cCan\u2019t catch me!\u201d he yelled then took off sprinting toward the park. Now that his pants were unbuttoned, they hung loosely from his hips, sliding further down with each stride of his long legs. </p><p>\u201cTaehyung!\u201d you called and bent down to scoop up his coat and shirt. \u201cGet back here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to catch me!\u201d he called back then disappeared into the trees surrounding the park.</p><p>This was not good. Not good at all. </p><p>It took you a few more minutes to get into the park and when you finally did, the light from the lamp posts didn\u2019t really reach more than a few meters off the main walkway.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung!\u201d you called into the darkness. Panic began to set in as you clutched his clothes tightly to your chest. \u201cTaehyung! This isn\u2019t funny!\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d he called from down the path. You could hear a faint rhythm begin to grow from the distance. It sounded strange. Like footsteps but much heavier and much sharper than a regular person would make. \u201cY/N! Look what I found!\u201d Taehyung\u2019s voice came again, overlapping the odd rhythm. But then the sounds made perfect sense and your eyes widened as a horse and carriage came into view around the ben. The person at the reigns was none other than your boyfriend in all of his half-naked glory.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou stole a sleigh?\u201d Jin screams and throws his head back in laughter.</p><p>The others are already long gone, howling and clutching their stomachs at the mention of Taehyung\u2019s drunken antics. Your poor boyfriend is still leaning against the wall behind you, his face turning a shade of red that\u2019s several darker than his hair. You turn around and slip your arms around his waist in a feeble attempt to comfort him.</p><p>\u201cYou learned your lesson, didn\u2019t you?\u201d you ask barely trying to hide the amused smile on your lips.</p><p>Taehyung sighs and drapes an arm around your neck, pulling you in so he can place a kiss on the top of your head. \u201cYeah I did,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve learned to never go near eggnog again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least not spiked eggnog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpiked or not.

He comes to stand beside you in full-on pout mode.</p><p>\u201cI think you mean embarrassing,\u201d he utters and crosses his arms over his chest.</p><p>\u201cCome on, hyung,\u201d Jungkook says falling down onto the couch beside Jimin, \u201cyou can\u2019t refer to it as \u2018The Eggnog Incident\u2019 and then not tell us about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>I</i> didn\u2019t refer to it as anything,\u201d Taehyung responds, throwing a glare your way.</p><p>You cringe. \u201cHow was I supposed to know you didn\u2019t want to tell them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe because they were literally holding me down trying to get me to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Taeyhungie,\u201d Yoongi says as he sinks down into the armchair closest to their Christmas tree. \u201cIt\u2019s going to come out eventually. You can\u2019t keep secrets in this house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially not at the annual Christmas party,\u201d Hoseok chimes in and raises his glass of eggnog up in agreement. \u201cCome on, Taetae. Story time.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung looks at you again and pulls his lips in between his teeth as a way of symbolically sealing them. Again, everyone else turns to look at you.</p><p>\u201cYoongi\u2019s right, Tae,\u201d you say looking back at your boyfriend. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna come out eventually.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung shakes his head.</p><p>You let out a sigh. \u201cCome on, guys. He doesn\u2019t want to tell. It\u2019s just something stupid he did after accidentally drinking a \u00a0bunch of spiked eggnog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you accidentally drink spiked eggnog?\u201d Namjoon asks narrowing his eyes and looking down at his own glass of the holiday drink.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was spiked,\u201d Taehyung utters.</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t taste the alcohol?\u201d Jimin asks in disbelief.</p><p>Taehyung shrugs. \u201cI\u2019d never had it before.\u201d Then he turns to you. \u201cI learned my lesson, though. So what happened last year will never happen again. And <i>never</i> needs to be spoken about.\u201d</p><p>Jimin lifts Jungkook\u2019s arm off from around his neck where the maknae had slung it a few minutes earlier and gets up off the couch. \u201cAlright, that\u2019s it,\u201d he says and sets his own drink down on the coffee table. \u201cIf you don\u2019t tell us what happened, Y/N is getting tickled to death.\u201d</p><p>Your eyes go wide as the others follow after Jimin. They can\u2019t be serious. But then they start creeping closer. You open your mouth and suck in a deep breath. \u201cIT ALL STARTED\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, wait, wait,\u201d Taehyung says stepping in front of you protectively.</p><p>The rest of the boys watch him with expectant smiles and he twists his neck around to look at you. \u201cYou owe me big time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust sit yourselves back down. No one needs to tickle Y/N.\u201d Then he sighs. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you about The Eggnog Incident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019d rather hear it from Y/N,\u201d Namjoon says with a wink. \u201cI have a feeling you\u2019d skip out on some important details.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung looks at you again and gives a defeated shrug. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>You take a deep breath and step forward. \u201cWell, it all started at last year\u2019s Christmas party\u2026\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve had enough, Tae,\u201d you giggled curling your finger around the handle of your boyfriend\u2019s cup. He wrenched it out of your grip with a loud laugh.</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d he yelled, his voice cracking. \u201cHave you tried this? I\u2019ve never had eggnog before. Why have I never tried eggnog? This. Stuff. Is. Amazing.\u201d With every word, he jabbed his cup forward against your arm, the creamy liquid sloshing out onto your sweater and the carpet.</p><p>\u201cI have tried it, actually,\u201d you replied. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think that\u2019s regular eggnog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s not regular eggnog. It\u2019s <i>delicious</i> eggnog.\u201d Then he threw his head back, draining the last bit of it and ran his tongue along his top lip to catch the last drop. \u201cI have an idea.\u201d Before you could even ask what it was, he grabbed your arm and tugged you out of the room. \u201cBye, guys!\u201d he yelled back to his six bandmates. </p><p>You could hear their goodbyes and confused questions fade away as the two of you bounded down the hall and out the door. The building that housed BigHit Entertainment was eerily quiet and the sound of Taehyung\u2019s inebriated laughter echoed down the halls as he pulled you along. Finally, the two of you burst through the front doors and out into the frigid night. </p><p>Christmas was the following week and it looked to you like it was going to be a white one. Snow had been falling almost continuously for the past several days and didn\u2019t seem to be letting up any time soon. The city was doing a fine job at keeping the roads plowed but that meant giant piles had been accumulating along the paths and sidewalks. The whole city was turning into one big snowy labyrinth. You\u2019d barely managed to grab your coat before Taehyung had tugged you out the door but now you wrapped it around yourself, thankful you had thought of the possibility that this brilliant idea of his meant going outside.</p><p>Now you stood on the sidewalk, admiring the way the street lamps reflected off the thin layer of frost covering everything and making it sparkle. You didn\u2019t even notice Taehyung wasn\u2019t beside you anymore until you turned to ask him what his idea was only to find he was gone. You twisted your neck left and right but he was nowhere to be found. </p><p>\u201cTae?\u201d you called out into the darkness. When he didn\u2019t respond, you cursed yourself for not thinking to text his manager to accompany the two of you. A member of the most popular boyband in the world was drunk and running loose in the city. There was no way this was going to end well. You plunged your hand into your pocket to grab your phone only to find that it wasn\u2019t there. Crap. You knew exactly where it was. Sitting on the counter in the kitchen charging back up in the dorm. Should you run back in and get it? The more time you wasted, the farther away Taehyung was going to wander. You couldn\u2019t risk it.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung!\u201d you called as you made your way carefully across the icy street. </p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d</p><p>Thank God. You spun in the direction you heard his voice only to find him waving back at you from two blocks down. \u201cHow\u2019d you get all the way down there?\u201d you called as you stumbled after him. </p><p>\u201cPretend like you\u2019re ice skating!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suck at ice skating!\u201d you yelled back, bravely breaking into a slow trot. Luckily, you managed to stay upright until you reached your boyfriend, though your slightly faster than walking speed on the slick pavement made it impossible for you to stop and you ended up slamming into his chest. You clung to him until you regained your balance, that being rather difficult because neither of you could stop laughing. At last you were able to pull away from him. And, of course, when you did, he broke away again.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Y/N!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTae, stop running!\u201d you yelled back and then let out a frustrated groan. \u201cTae, slow down!\u201d</p><p>He was halfway across a large field, heading toward city park when he spun back around. \u201cAre you hot, Y/N?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m in a sauna!\u201d Then to your horror, he pulled off his thick coat and then proceeded to yank his shirt off over his head.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung!\u201d you yelled and broke back into a run as he started unbuttoning his pants. \u201cLeave your clothes on! Are you crazy? You\u2019re going to freeze!\u201d</p><p>Luckily, he stopped trying to take his pants off when he saw you coming after him, instead deciding you were now playing a game of tag. \u201cCan\u2019t catch me!\u201d he yelled then took off sprinting toward the park. Now that his pants were unbuttoned, they hung loosely from his hips, sliding further down with each stride of his long legs. </p><p>\u201cTaehyung!\u201d you called and bent down to scoop up his coat and shirt. \u201cGet back here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to catch me!\u201d he called back then disappeared into the trees surrounding the park.</p><p>This was not good. Not good at all. </p><p>It took you a few more minutes to get into the park and when you finally did, the light from the lamp posts didn\u2019t really reach more than a few meters off the main walkway.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung!\u201d you called into the darkness. Panic began to set in as you clutched his clothes tightly to your chest. \u201cTaehyung! This isn\u2019t funny!\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d he called from down the path. You could hear a faint rhythm begin to grow from the distance. It sounded strange. Like footsteps but much heavier and much sharper than a regular person would make. \u201cY/N! Look what I found!\u201d Taehyung\u2019s voice came again, overlapping the odd rhythm. But then the sounds made perfect sense and your eyes widened as a horse and carriage came into view around the ben. The person at the reigns was none other than your boyfriend in all of his half-naked glory.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou stole a sleigh?\u201d Jin screams and throws his head back in laughter.</p><p>The others are already long gone, howling and clutching their stomachs at the mention of Taehyung\u2019s drunken antics. Your poor boyfriend is still leaning against the wall behind you, his face turning a shade of red that\u2019s several darker than his hair. You turn around and slip your arms around his waist in a feeble attempt to comfort him.</p><p>\u201cYou learned your lesson, didn\u2019t you?\u201d you ask barely trying to hide the amused smile on your lips.</p><p>Taehyung sighs and drapes an arm around your neck, pulling you in so he can place a kiss on the top of your head. \u201cYeah I did,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve learned to never go near eggnog again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least not spiked eggnog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpiked or not. It does <i>not</i> taste good coming back up. I don\u2019t remember much about that night but the taste of half-digested eggnog is one I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d</p><p>You stretch up onto your toes and press your lips against your boyfriend\u2019s cheek. \u201cHey, it could have been a lot worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d he says and looks back at the rest of the guys. \u201cCan you imagine what would have happened if I pulled one of them out after me instead of you?\u201d</p><figure data-orig-width=\"482\" data-orig-height=\"109\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c17528eacc4e904df4737b38e2406c08/tumblr_inline_pk6j6x8U9l1qe89j5_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"482\" data-orig-height=\"109\"></figure></p>",
