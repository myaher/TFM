It was so, so good and the birthday cake flavor was fantastic. I was half expecting the dough to taste highly processed and a little strange but it tasted like homemade dough through and through. Apparently you can also bake the dough but that never happened in our house because we couldn\u2019t resist the dough. I\u2019m sure this goes without saying, but it\u2019s incredibly addicting so don\u2019t open up a jar of that stuff and think you\u2019ll have \u201cjust one scoop\u201d because I\u2019m convinced that\u2019s physically impossible.</p>\n<ul><li>\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.superfat.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SuperFat Nut Butter</a></h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3861.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84919\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3861-1024x737.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"447\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3861-1024x737.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3861-300x216.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3861-768x553.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3861.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\"/></a></p>\n<p>The team behind SuperFat nut butters sent me a few of their new blended nut butter packets to try this week and I think I went to heaven when I opened up the cacao coconut pouch.

The company is brand new so the nut butters are not available for purchase yet \u2014 they\u2019re launching a KickStarter on February 4 \u2014 but their blended base of macadamia nuts and almonds was irresistible for this nut butter lover!</p>\n<ul><li>\n<h4>Friday Flashbacks</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/party-favorite-recipes_thumb.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81655\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/party-favorite-recipes_thumb.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"426\" height=\"639\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/party-favorite-recipes_thumb.png 479w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/party-favorite-recipes_thumb-200x300.png 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\"/></a></p>\n<p>Sharing a few of my favorite easy party food recipes just in case you\u2019re looking for something delicious to make for a Super Bowl party this weekend!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/black-bean-and-brown-rice-salad/\"><strong>Black Bean and Brown Rice Salad</strong></a>: A cold and tasty dish bursting with color, texture, flavor, healthy veggies and whole grains.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/paleo-coconut-crisps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Paleo Coconut Crisps</a> </strong>(You only need 10 minutes and five simple ingredients to make this deliciously crunchy treat!)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/chocolate-chip-almond-butter-bars/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Chocolate Chip Almond Butter Bars</strong></a><strong>:</strong>\u00a0Made with coconut oil, oats and honey, these bars come together quickly and disappear even faster once you take them out of the oven.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/shrimp-dip-cream-cheese/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Simple Shrimp Dip</strong></a><strong>:</strong>\u00a0A crowd-pleaser that\u2019s easy to make and one of my most popular blog recipes ever!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/cold-quinoa-salad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Cold Quinoa Salad</strong></a><strong>:</strong>\u00a0Light, refreshing and easy to prep ahead.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/paleo-lemon-cupcakes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Paleo Lemon Cupcakes</strong></a><strong>:</strong>\u00a0A citrusy sweet treat that\u2019s Paleo-friendly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/easy-cilantro-shrimp-appetizer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Easy Cilantro Shrimp Appetizer</strong></a><strong>:</strong>\u00a0A one-dish recipe bursting with flavor thanks to cilantro and a squeeze of fresh lime juice.</p>\n<h4>Question of the Day</h4>\n<p><strong>What is one thing you are loving this week?</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/things-im-loving-friday-266/\">Things I\u2019m Loving Friday #266</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com\">Peanut Butter Fingers</a>.</p><br/><br/>\nfrom Health &amp; Wellness <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/things-im-loving-friday-266/\">https://www.pbfingers.com/things-im-loving-friday-266/</a><br/>\nvia <a href=\"http://www.rssmix.com/\">http://www.rssmix.com/</a>",

I cannot wait for Chase to wake up this morning to find his heart and explain to him one of the many reasons why Mom and Dad love him so much.

One Day in December follows the next 10 years of Laurie and Jack&rsquo;s lives through fierce friendship, heartbreak, missed opportunities, growth and change as they strive to find happiness.</p>\n<ul><li>\n<h4>Hearts on Kid&rsquo;s Doors for Valentine&rsquo;s Day</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3875-1024x742.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p>I saw this idea on Instagram and thought it was just the cutest thing! Beginning today, February 1, up until Valentine&rsquo;s Day, tape one heart a day on your child&rsquo;s door featuring one reason why you love them. Easy and so darn sweet! I cannot wait for Chase to wake up this morning to find his heart and explain to him one of the many reasons why Mom and Dad love him so much. And for sweet little Ryder, I&rsquo;ll be sure to brew up some extra loving breast milk up for him in lieu of the hearts since breast milk is his current love language.</p>\n<ul><li>\n<h4>Edible Cookie Dough</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3864-794x1024.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p>One week I will learn how to tame the sugar monster that lives inside of me but this week was clearly not that week. Ryan bought a jar of <a href=\"https://justforall.com/en-us/products/consumer/cookie-dough\" target=\"_blank\">JUST edible cookie dough</a> last weekend and we went to town on that thing! It was so, so good and the birthday cake flavor was fantastic. I was half expecting the dough to taste highly processed and a little strange but it tasted like homemade dough through and through. Apparently you can also bake the dough but that never happened in our house because we couldn&rsquo;t resist the dough. I&rsquo;m sure this goes without saying, but it&rsquo;s incredibly addicting so don&rsquo;t open up a jar of that stuff and think you&rsquo;ll have &ldquo;just one scoop&rdquo; because I&rsquo;m convinced that&rsquo;s physically impossible.</p>\n<ul><li>\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.superfat.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SuperFat Nut Butter</a></h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3861-1024x737.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p>The team behind SuperFat nut butters sent me a few of their new blended nut butter packets to try this week and I think I went to heaven when I opened up the cacao coconut pouch. It was perfectly creamy, lightly sweet and so delicious right out of the pouch, though I am now having visions of swirling it into a hot bowl of oatmeal! The company is brand new so the nut butters are not available for purchase yet &mdash; they&rsquo;re launching a KickStarter on February 4 &mdash; but their blended base of macadamia nuts and almonds was irresistible for this nut butter lover!</p>\n<ul><li>\n<h4>Friday Flashbacks</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/party-favorite-recipes_thumb.png\">External image</div></p>\n<p>Sharing a few of my favorite easy party food recipes just in case you&rsquo;re looking for something delicious to make for a Super Bowl party this weekend!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/black-bean-and-brown-rice-salad/\"><strong>Black Bean and Brown Rice Salad</strong></a>: A cold and tasty dish bursting with color, texture, flavor, healthy veggies and whole grains.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/paleo-coconut-crisps/\" target=\"_blank\">Paleo Coconut Crisps</a> </strong>(You only need 10 minutes and five simple ingredients to make this deliciously crunchy treat!)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/chocolate-chip-almond-butter-bars/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Chocolate Chip Almond Butter Bars</strong></a><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;Made with coconut oil, oats and honey, these bars come together quickly and disappear even faster once you take them out of the oven.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/shrimp-dip-cream-cheese/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Simple Shrimp Dip</strong></a><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;A crowd-pleaser that&rsquo;s easy to make and one of my most popular blog recipes ever!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/cold-quinoa-salad/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Cold Quinoa Salad</strong></a><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;Light, refreshing and easy to prep ahead.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/paleo-lemon-cupcakes/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Paleo Lemon Cupcakes</strong></a><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;A citrusy sweet treat that&rsquo;s Paleo-friendly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/easy-cilantro-shrimp-appetizer/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Easy Cilantro Shrimp Appetizer</strong></a><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;A one-dish recipe bursting with flavor thanks to cilantro and a squeeze of fresh lime juice.</p>\n<h4>Question of the Day</h4>\n<p><strong>What is one thing you are loving this week?</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/things-im-loving-friday-266/\">Things I&rsquo;m Loving Friday #266</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com\">Peanut Butter Fingers</a>.</p><br /><br />\nfrom Health &amp; Wellness <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/things-im-loving-friday-266/\">https://www.pbfingers.com/things-im-loving-friday-266/</a><br />\nvia <a href=\"http://www.rssmix.com/\">http://www.rssmix.com/</a></p>",
