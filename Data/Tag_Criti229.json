You wouldn&rsquo;t want us to <i>not be merciful</i>, would you?&rdquo;</li></ul><p>I don&rsquo;t think he understands there are consequences for any of this. His 7 WIS score would make sense. Low wisdom means you see the world as just existing around you - he doesn&rsquo;t understand (or care) about how his actions are affecting people (both on a large scale, like giving Uk&rsquo;otoa more power, and on a smaller scale, like ignoring Jester and sleeping with Avantika). I think he doesn&rsquo;t <i>realize</i>&nbsp;how much of an effect he can have because he&rsquo;s felt powerless for so long (another result of his bullied-outcast childhood).</p><p>The part of him that knows he&rsquo;s getting carried away was the part that talked to Caleb, the conversation whose subtext boiled down to&nbsp;&ldquo;kill me if I endanger anyone we care about.&rdquo; But in doing this, he&rsquo;s also taking the responsibility for his actions away from himself, and giving it to Caleb. If he does something bad, it&rsquo;s not his fault, it&rsquo;s Caleb&rsquo;s (or Beau&rsquo;s) fault for not stopping him.</p><p>I think Uk&rsquo;otoa&rsquo;s influence is corrupting Fjord. I think we knew the genuine Fjord before, even if he seemed super sketchy and untrustworthy at times. I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s a way for this to end well at all. I think getting closer to Uk&rsquo;otoa and any new power will absolutely just make him more cruel and power-hungry. I wonder if maybe he&rsquo;ll multiclass out of warlock and into something else, because doing anything to gain more power could be <i>seriously dangerous</i>.</p><p>Also Travis is doing a fucking great job and I love it. This sounds really critical of Fjord but he&rsquo;s still my fave and I&rsquo;d die for him. Thanks for coming to my ted talk</p>",

For Caleb and Avantika, Caleb has the advantage of initiative, deliberately shrouding himself in mediocrity and waiting for the opportune moment. I believe he has a handle on Avantika; he sees the zealotry and pride in the Captain, the surety of purpose that also blinds, because he was once that fanatical, that cocky and sure of ultimate victory.\u00a0</p><p>I believe that Caleb\u2019s trauma is also preventing him from actively seeking to enact any violent escape plan.
