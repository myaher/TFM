You see Tony wasn\u2019t one for hiding things, meaning it was really easy to waltz into the towers and get a shock from JARVIS.</p><p>\u201cit was good, some child got in my way and kept asking for an autograph. Other than that it was great.\u201d I replied in the same low snarky voice as my stark. It wasn\u2019t like I had a choice. My cells had mutated so everything about me was tony stark. \u201ccan you tell me where the other Avengers are.\u201d</p><p>I was impatient and needed to get this plan going. With my calculations I only had half an hour left until tony woke up and arrived at the tower.</p><p>\u201cAt the moment all of them are in the living room having breakfast. Would you like me to inform them of your arrival?\u201d \u00a0JARVIS being the smol bean that h is gave me all the information that needed to have my fun.</p><p>A smirk crossed my face for a brief second. I knew this was going to give me a lifetime of fun.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay Jarvis I\u2019ll just go surprise them.\u201d You see in my year on the streets there was not much to do, so there may have been a few times that I hacked stark tech and I may or may not have found out the blueprints to the complex. I\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it till it sinks in, the avengers are idiots.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take me long to make it to the living room and it didn\u2019t take me long to put my plan into action.</p><p>\u201cGood morning people who don\u2019t pay to live here but still end up eating all my food.\u201d I announce in such an arrogant way I want to puke.</p><p>\u201cwe save the world, I think we deserve it.\u201d Whoa looks like Mr Hawkeye is an unexpected snarker. Turning myself to look at his relaxed figure on the coach with the one and only black widow/Natasha on the other.</p><p>\u201cNo need to be like that\u201d I approach him and throw myself onto the empty space next to him. I sit like I own the room, which I technically do (ooooo all the things I would do if I only had time)</p><p>\u201cMove it stark.\u201d He reacts like a pro and pushes me away from him, I don\u2019t care I already got what I wanted from him. Time for my next victim. </p><p>\u201cNat are you going to let him talk to me like that.\u201d A pout is prominent on my face as I go to hug her.

What a surprise to see you two here.&rdquo; I approach them both and walk around them, pretending I&rsquo;m making a long journey to face them.</p><p>&ldquo;Stark this is no time for jokes what you discovered last ni..&rdquo; fury tries to speak to me but my time had run out and I had already accomplished what I came for.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry fury I would love to stay and chat but I got to unload a huge dump. So hold that thought.&rdquo; I walk calmly out of the lab not even attempting to listen to fury&rsquo;s shouts of fury (ayyyy get it) and not even thinking to look back at his winking rage face. </p><p>The moments the doors close I&rsquo;m running to the elevator, you know Starks private one. It doesn&rsquo;t take me long to go inside and it doesn&rsquo;t take me long to transform myself into a random women in a shield uniform. The moment the doors open I&rsquo;m walking out toward the front door.</p><p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh as once I had left the building I smelt and saw a trash covered stark supporting the angriest face I had ever seen. I would have felt like I was walking on clouds however I couldn&rsquo;t; my pockets were too heavy with the weight of six wallets and two watches.</p><p>tag list</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4cSrKkCaMJkxmNQOUg9VyA\">@fmb158581</a> &nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/me-1c-LLUt_iwwRSJD7yoGg\">@musicfreak180</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkPj0f2ty26pT7fVvwVAqvQ\">@mikariell95</a></p>",
