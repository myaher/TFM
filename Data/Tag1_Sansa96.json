Anyway, it&rsquo;s just some random fluff about Dany and Sansa after the war is over and everyone is happy. Bc I know s8 is going to crush me soon and I like to dream.</b></p><p>Daenerys found Sansa in the gardens. She didn\u2019t have to do much looking. More often than not Sansa spent any downtime she had surrounded by the extensive greenery of the palace gardens. It was one of the few places the girl seemed to be able to find solace in a city that had taken so much from her.</p><p>It was a beautiful place, especially on a beautiful day. The flowers were in bloom and the leaves on the trees were a bright shade of green. Sunlight dripped lazily above and coated the whole garden in a sense of warmth. Dany saw Sansa before the girl noticed her approaching. She was sitting on the grass, her skirt spread out around her, her eyes were closed and her face was placid. Her red hair was stunning, the backdrop of the azure sky made it look like a beautiful sunset over the water.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cSansa,\u201d Dany spoke softly, afraid to ruin the serenity of the moment.</p><p>\u201cDany, hello,\u201d Sansa said with a soft smile.</p><p>Dany, it was still strange sometimes to hear the name coming from someone who wasn\u2019t her brother. But she liked the way it sounded when Sansa said it. It was soft and caring, and sometimes in the nights, it was raw and passionate. </p><p>\u201cEnjoying the nice weather?\u201d Dany asked, taking a seat on the grass. </p><p>\u201cYes, quite so.\u201d</p><p>The spring was refreshing after the cold of the winter. The breeze carried around the scent of petals and the sound of carefree laughter.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d check on our little one,\u201d Sansa said.</p><p>The girl gestured to the ground next to them where a little tree was sprouting up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s coming along nicely.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys remembered planting the tree. It was after the war had ended. So much had been lost, completely and utterly destroyed. Realistically, she knew a tree couldn\u2019t change of that. But it helped both the girls feel better, even if it was silly. It was nice to have something growing.</p><p>\u201cAre you tired?\u201d Dany looked over at Sansa who had closed her eyes again.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m alright,\u201d Sansa said.</p><p>Dany knew she was lying. Sansa hadn\u2019t gotten a single good night\u2019s sleep since they arrived. Honestly, neither had Dany. Sometimes she thought it would be years until anyone in the kingdom was able to sleep soundly without the constant chase of nightmares.</p><p>\u201cLay your head on me, you can sleep now.\u201d<br/><br/></p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I have work to do,\u201d she seemed to suddenly remember the overwhelming number of tasks ahead of them as she stirred out of her calm.<br/></p><p>\u201cSansa, you have done more work than anyone in all of the Seven Kingdoms,\u201d Dany took her hand gently, \u201cright now, you need to rest.\u201d</p><p>Sansa seemed to consider protesting but ultimately gave in after a stern look. She lay her head down on Dany\u2019s lap and closed her eyes. </p><p>Dany ran her fingers through Sansa\u2019s auburn locks. Her hair was smooth and soft and possibly Dany\u2019s favorite thing in the world, well aside from maybe her eyes, or her smile. After a few minutes, Dany reached out to a plant next to her and carefully plucked a few blooms by the stems.

\u00a0I think the answer is that they didn\u2019t. \u00a0They simply changed things on the show and made the motif a feather instead of a rose. \u00a0I think that they went this route because of their decision not to film the Tourney at Harrenhal. \u00a0My thinking is that they didn\u2019t film the tourney because they wanted Rhaegar\u2019s connection to Jon via Lyanna to remain a mystery until the latter seasons of the show.</p><p>Some will argue that almost everyone knew that Rhaegar was Jon\u2019s dad and so there was no need to hide the linkage by replacing the rose with a feather. \u00a0To that I would answer that there are still fans who have read the books who don\u2019t believe that R+L=J. \u00a0More importantly, those of us who have read the books tend to forget that the vast majority of the viewers of the show have not done so and most likely never will. \u00a0It seems pretty obvious that D&amp;D\u2019s writing are more for those viewers than the rest of us who have read the books. \u00a0This actually makes sense when you consider that it was these viewers who were blown away by the many surprises in the earlier seasons and who spread the word that GOT was not your typical fantasy story. \u00a0This was a major contributor to the popularity of the show.</p><p>However, while I can see them not wanting to introduce Rhaegar into Jon and Lyanna\u2019s story too early, they still needed a way to connect all three. \u00a0They seem to have decided that the best way to do so while keeping to the theme in the books was with a motif other than the blue rose. \u00a0The question then became what and how. \u00a0</p><p>With Ned and Robert being the only two still alive that were directly connected to both Rhaegar, Lyanna and the events of the past, it made sense that they were used to set up the linkage. \u00a0All that remained was a decision on the choice of motif to use as the replacement for the rose.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1192\" data-orig-height=\"714\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/93d00bc3e3f6fc7d721d21f8da9f12ba/tumblr_inline_pow6twEkn01scj86c_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1192\" data-orig-height=\"714\"/></figure><p>They decided to go with a feather and while this may seem like an unfathomable choice for some, I think that the choice was made for the specific reason that it could be tied to Sansa\u2019s arc. \u00a0So they went with a feather as the motif and had Robert place it on Lyanna\u2019s crypt in the first episode of the series where it sat gathering dust until season 5, episode 4 when it was found by Sansa. \u00a0What a coincidence!</p><p>Sansa finding the feather was not the only coincidence in the scene. \u00a0There were two others.

Many biblical scholars are of the opinion that this Song of Songs tells a story that is very similar to the ones of various ancient cultures wherein the fertility of the earth is dependent on a sexual encounter between a man and a woman\u2014generally godlike deities.</p><p>One interesting thing about the Rose of Sharon referenced in the poem is the description of the ancient location from where it received its name. \u00a0This is the description of ancient Sharon.</p><blockquote><p>The Plain of, the area where the coastal plain widens south of the slopes of Mt. Carmel, extending about thirty miles south to the Yarkon River north of Joppa. It varies from about eight to twelve miles in width. In Israelite times, the dunes supported an impenetrable oak forest. Pastureland would have been on the fringe of the forest (1 Chr 27:29). The rose of Sharon is kind of a crocus growing as a \u201clily among brambles\u201d (Song 2:1-2). Thus the biblical picture of Sharon is a forbidding jungle of oaks and swampy marshes rather than a fertile or productive plain.</p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http://www.bibleodyssey.org/HarperCollinsBibleDictionary/s/sharon.aspx&amp;t=NDBkNDk3NjBmOTA1NTI1MTNkNjljNjQzMjIzZTI3MDgzNDBlMjBlOSxDTU9NS\" target=\"_blank\">Society of Biblical Literature</a> </p></blockquote><p>The description of the Plains of Sharon is extremely similar to that of the River Styx and it\u2019s surrounding marshy landscape. \u00a0In ancient Greek mythology, Styx was the name given to the river that led to the domain of Hades. \u00a0He of course was the Lord of the Underworld who kidnapped Persephone from the Vale of Nysa while she was out picking flowers. \u00a0And it just so happens that the flowers that were used by Hades to entice the young goddess and bring her into his clutches was none other than the narcissus jonquilla or in other words, the ancient rose. \u00a0Today\u2019s modern roses are hybrids and look nothing like their ancient counterparts.</p><p>As has been suggested by many in the fandom, through her abduction by Petyr Baelish, he of the demonic last name, Sansa is the symbolic Persephone of the story. \u00a0Petyr even attempts to tempt her with a slice of pomegranate as Hades did with the mythical daughter of Demeter and Zeus.</p><p>I mentioned this bit about Persephone and the Rose of Sharon to show that Sansa is symbolically connected to the both the jonquil flower as well as to the ancient in-story character who bears its name. \u00a0I am of course speaking of the mysterious woman from Florian and Jonquil fame. \u00a0The real world myths about the jonquil flower along with textural clues\u2026including the drawing of the famous pair that appears in <i>The Hedge Knight</i> have led me to the conclusion that the ancient Jonquil was the original Blue Winter Rose of House Stark. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"1171\" data-orig-height=\"940\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ac3e7854bacf256e995b05d500fe36a3/tumblr_inline_pow7dyMK1Q1scj86c_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1171\" data-orig-height=\"940\"/></figure><p>As I\u2019ve stated, based on how it has been used on the show, it seems obvious that he feather motif is playing the part of the blue winter rose in the story. \u00a0If Jonquil was indeed the original Blue Winter Rose, it could also explain why the feather is so closely connected to Sansa in the show. \u00a0However, this raises a question. \u00a0</p><p>If the blue sweet smelling flower in the crack in the Wall that Dany saw in her vision is meant to signify her connection to Jon and their future marriage as many in the fandom argue is the case, shouldn\u2019t the feather as the stand-in for the winter rose on the show be tied to her? \u00a0<b>Why isn\u2019t the feather connected to Dany</b>? Curious, don\u2019t you think! \u00a0If further proof is needed that the true romantic arc in the story is not Jon and Dany but rather Jon and Sansa then there is no greater evidence than the feather.\u00a0 And as Sansa is never shown returning the feather, it means that she still has it.</p><p>There is one last thing that I want to discuss before I end. \u00a0If Sansa is the Blue Winter Rose, a fact that on its basic level cannot be argued with as she is a daughter of House Stark; and if the feather is the playing the part of the flower on the show\u2014meaning that Sansa should also be seen as the feather; then what is the symbolic importance of it freezing in the teaser as it applies to Sansa?</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1236\" data-orig-height=\"696\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/710f1895aba4c3e4c03f8ddbdf4af67e/tumblr_inline_pow6hgKIMm1scj86c_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1236\" data-orig-height=\"696\"/></figure><p>I proposed that it implies that Sansa is in danger not just from the actions of Cersei as things come to a close but also from the Night King. \u00a0Yes, everyone is in danger from the White Walkers but my tinfoil is that Sansa faces a specific threat from the Night King and that is what is implied with the freezing of the feather and Arya and Jon pulling their weapons and stepping protectively in front of her.\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>Now, the scene of the three in the crypts won\u2019t be in the show.\u00a0 \u00a0Rather like the first teaser it is meant to set up the theme of the season.\u00a0 The first teaser with ice and fire meeting over the Trident on Aegon\u2019s Painted Table is meant to show the theme of the danger that both forces will pose to the realm.\u00a0 And I think that the second is meant to showcase the danger of the White Walkers to the Starks as a whole and possibly to Sansa in particular.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1248\" data-orig-height=\"788\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/115d899aa3af6afcd81599ee19f92d51/tumblr_inline_pow6v6576o1scj86c_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1248\" data-orig-height=\"788\"/></figure><p>For this reason, I am most curious to find out what is on the scroll that Sophie mentioned was given to her by the prop guy as a keepsake of the show. \u00a0I think that it\u2019s quite possible that the scroll in question was the one Sam was shown taking from the Citadel and that once revealed, the contents will have something to do with Sansa\u2026maybe even a drawing of an ancient woman that looks like her. \u00a0My tinfoil is that it will be a drawing with a face that is similar to the one in Botticelli\u2019s \u201cBirth of Venus.\u201d \u00a0Just three more weeks to go to find out whether my theories end up being pure tinfoil or whether I\u2019m onto something in regards to the books and overall story. \u00a0Can\u2019t wait to find out!<br/></p>",

Many biblical scholars are of the opinion that this Song of Songs tells a story that is very similar to the ones of various ancient cultures wherein the fertility of the earth is dependent on a sexual encounter between a man and a woman\u2014generally godlike deities.</p><p>One interesting thing about the Rose of Sharon referenced in the poem is the description of the ancient location from where it received its name. \u00a0This is the description of ancient Sharon.</p><blockquote><p>The Plain of, the area where the coastal plain widens south of the slopes of Mt. Carmel, extending about thirty miles south to the Yarkon River north of Joppa. It varies from about eight to twelve miles in width. In Israelite times, the dunes supported an impenetrable oak forest. Pastureland would have been on the fringe of the forest (1 Chr 27:29). The rose of Sharon is kind of a crocus growing as a \u201clily among brambles\u201d (Song 2:1-2). Thus the biblical picture of Sharon is a forbidding jungle of oaks and swampy marshes rather than a fertile or productive plain.</p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http://www.bibleodyssey.org/HarperCollinsBibleDictionary/s/sharon.aspx&amp;t=NDBkNDk3NjBmOTA1NTI1MTNkNjljNjQzMjIzZTI3MDgzNDBlMjBlOSxDTU9NS\" target=\"_blank\">Society of Biblical Literature</a> </p></blockquote><p>The description of the Plains of Sharon is extremely similar to that of the River Styx and it\u2019s surrounding marshy landscape. \u00a0In ancient Greek mythology, Styx was the name given to the river that led to the domain of Hades. \u00a0He of course was the Lord of the Underworld who kidnapped Persephone from the Vale of Nysa while she was out picking flowers. \u00a0And it just so happens that the flowers that were used by Hades to entice the young goddess and bring her into his clutches was none other than the narcissus jonquilla or in other words, the ancient rose. \u00a0Today\u2019s modern roses are hybrids and look nothing like their ancient counterparts.</p><p>As has been suggested by many in the fandom, through her abduction by Petyr Baelish, he of the demonic last name, Sansa is the symbolic Persephone of the story. \u00a0Petyr even attempts to tempt her with a slice of pomegranate as Hades did with the mythical daughter of Demeter and Zeus.</p><p>I mentioned this bit about Persephone and the Rose of Sharon to show that Sansa is symbolically connected to the both the jonquil flower as well as to the ancient in-story character who bears its name. \u00a0I am of course speaking of the mysterious woman from Florian and Jonquil fame. \u00a0The real world myths about the jonquil flower along with textural clues\u2026including the drawing of the famous pair that appears in <i>The Hedge Knight</i> have led me to the conclusion that the ancient Jonquil was the original Blue Winter Rose of House Stark. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"1171\" data-orig-height=\"940\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ac3e7854bacf256e995b05d500fe36a3/tumblr_inline_pow7dyMK1Q1scj86c_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1171\" data-orig-height=\"940\"></figure><p>As I\u2019ve stated, based on how it has been used on the show, it seems obvious that he feather motif is playing the part of the blue winter rose in the story. \u00a0If Jonquil was indeed the original Blue Winter Rose, it could also explain why the feather is so closely connected to Sansa in the show. \u00a0However, this raises a question. \u00a0</p><p>If the blue sweet smelling flower in the crack in the Wall that Dany saw in her vision is meant to signify her connection to Jon and their future marriage as many in the fandom argue is the case, shouldn\u2019t the feather as the stand-in for the winter rose on the show be tied to her? \u00a0<b>Why isn\u2019t the feather connected to Dany</b>? Curious, don\u2019t you think! \u00a0If further proof is needed that the true romantic arc in the story is not Jon and Dany but rather Jon and Sansa then there is no greater evidence than the feather.\u00a0 And as Sansa is never shown returning the feather, it means that she still has it.</p><p>There is one last thing that I want to discuss before I end. \u00a0If Sansa is the Blue Winter Rose, a fact that on its basic level cannot be argued with as she is a daughter of House Stark; and if the feather is the playing the part of the flower on the show\u2014meaning that Sansa should also be seen as the feather; then what is the symbolic importance of it freezing in the teaser as it applies to Sansa?</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1236\" data-orig-height=\"696\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/710f1895aba4c3e4c03f8ddbdf4af67e/tumblr_inline_pow6hgKIMm1scj86c_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1236\" data-orig-height=\"696\"></figure><p>I proposed that it implies that Sansa is in danger not just from the actions of Cersei as things come to a close but also from the Night King. \u00a0Yes, everyone is in danger from the White Walkers but my tinfoil is that Sansa faces a specific threat from the Night King and that is what is implied with the freezing of the feather and Arya and Jon pulling their weapons and stepping protectively in front of her.\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>Now, the scene of the three in the crypts won\u2019t be in the show.\u00a0 \u00a0Rather like the first teaser it is meant to set up the theme of the season.\u00a0 The first teaser with ice and fire meeting over the Trident on Aegon\u2019s Painted Table is meant to show the theme of the danger that both forces will pose to the realm.\u00a0 And I think that the second is meant to showcase the danger of the White Walkers to the Starks as a whole and possibly to Sansa in particular.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1248\" data-orig-height=\"788\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/115d899aa3af6afcd81599ee19f92d51/tumblr_inline_pow6v6576o1scj86c_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1248\" data-orig-height=\"788\"></figure><p>For this reason, I am most curious to find out what is on the scroll that Sophie mentioned was given to her by the prop guy as a keepsake of the show. \u00a0I think that it\u2019s quite possible that the scroll in question was the one Sam was shown taking from the Citadel and that once revealed, the contents will have something to do with Sansa\u2026maybe even a drawing of an ancient woman that looks like her. \u00a0My tinfoil is that it will be a drawing with a face that is similar to the one in Botticelli\u2019s \u201cBirth of Venus.\u201d \u00a0Just three more weeks to go to find out whether my theories end up being pure tinfoil or whether I\u2019m onto something in regards to the books and overall story. \u00a0Can\u2019t wait to find out!<br></p>",

Pastureland would have been on the fringe of the forest (1 Chr 27:29). The rose of Sharon is kind of a crocus growing as a \u201clily among brambles\u201d (Song 2:1-2).

From the corner of her eyes she watched the setting sun. </p><!-- more --><p>Jon would be here at sundown. </p><p>She only had to make it through the next few minutes. </p><p>Next to the shore Ramsay stood still to face her. He had a devilish smirk on his face and there was something gleaming in his eyes that Sansa didn\u2019t quite like. There was actually quite little about him that she liked. \u201cDo you have any special wishes for tonight, my lady?\u201d </p><p>The wind carried his whispers towards her and Sansa straightened her back. \u201cYes.\u201d She spoke firmly. Her eyes scanned the surface of the sea, but she didn\u2019t see Jon anywhere. </p><p>But Jon was a merman. He could be anywhere. Hopefully he was anywhere near. </p><p>\u201cI want to do it in the sea.\u201d</p><p>The smirk on Ramsay\u2019s face brightened and in one smooth movement he pulled his shirt over his head. Looking at his bare chest almost made her throw up and once more she stared at the waves crashing on the beach. </p><p>She took one more deep breath and then she took off her thin summer dress. She didn\u2019t like how Ramsay\u2019s eyes scanned her almost naked body. She didn\u2019t like the tip of his tongue licking his lips while his glance rested on her bra. She most of all didn\u2019t like the sweaty hands he placed on her hips, his thumbs resting on the insides of her thighs. </p><p>\u201cRelax, Sansa Stark.\u201d If his touch was meant to be comforting it failed hopelessly. \u201cJust try to enjoy it. I certainly will.\u201d He pressed his lips on hers and for a moment Sansa was unable to move or kiss him back. But that didn\u2019t seem to bother Ramsay at all. </p><p>The few seconds that passed seemed to last days, but eventually he stepped back and pulled down his pants which gave Sansa the chance to rush into the sea to wash her lips with salted water.</p><p>\u201cGood\u2026\u201d Ramsay wrapped his arms around her and Sansa felt a strange and unwelcome pressure in her back. \u201cYou already made yourself wet.\u201d His hand shove down her stomach into her briefs and Sansa closed her eyes firmly. </p><p>Her lips whispered an endless prayer, but tears were stinging in her eyes when Ramsay\u2019s hand slid between her legs. </p><p>\u201cSansa\u2026\u201d </p><p>Her eyes flashed open again when she heard her name and when she saw Jon\u2019s wet black curls only a few inches away from her she gathered all the courage she had left. </p><p>An unpleasant tingle rolled down her arm when her elbow crashed into Ramsay\u2019s ribcage, but his hand was gone, his arms were gone and when she turned around she saw how dark purple tentacles curled around his wrists and ankles to keep him down in the water.</p><p>\u201cIs this the girl you were talking about, Jon Targaryen?\u201d </p><p>A shiver rolled down Sansa\u2019s back, but Jon appeared next to her and nodded firmly.</p><p>He kept his distance. He didn\u2019t place a hand on her back. He didn\u2019t wrap an arm around her. But he wore a frown on his forehead and he constantly tucked the same black curl behind his ear. </p><p>\u201cWhat&rsquo;s your name, girl?\u201d </p><p>Sansa didn\u2019t know who was talking, but when she looked at Jon he nodded once more. \u201cSansa Stark.\u201d Instinctively she reached for Jon&rsquo;s hand and she lifted her chin when their fingers entwined. </p><p>\u201cAnd you are willing to leave the human world behind?\u201d</p><p>The palms of her hands were sweating, but her voice didn\u2019t even tremble. \u201cYes.\u201d </p><p>She had said her goodbyes. She was sure that her parents and siblings hadn\u2019t understood that they were goodbyes, but she assumed they would figure that out soon enough. </p><p>\u201cAnd you understand you can never ever return?\u201d</p><p>She hoped they would all understand why she had done it. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s grip on her hand tightened and he moved a little closer towards her. The heat of his body was comforting. But it was most of all his silence that made her feel at ease. And somehow she knew that if she would change her mind now, he would let her go. </p><p>\u201cHow will you pay for your new life?\u201d </p><p>Sansa looked at Jon and Jon gestured at Ramsay Bolton, who was gasping for air and fighting the tentacles holding him down. \u201cI will pay with the life of Lord Ramsay Bolton.\u201d She kept her eyes firmly on his struggling body.</p><p>Her parents had raised her to be compassionate, but she couldn\u2019t feel any compassion for the man who had promised her nothing but misery. And if that made her a bad person, she liked being one. </p><p>\u201cI accept your payment.\u201d </p><p>Ramsay Bolton could breath one more time before he went under again and this time for good.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to watch him die?\u201d Jon squeezed her hand and when Sansa nodded he dived down and pulled her with him.</p><p>One more time Sansa took a deep breath and with her eyes wide open she followed the crown prince into the depths of the sea. Her sight was surprisingly clear and a strange kind of warmth rushed through her veins when she saw Ramsay looking at her. </p><p>His kicking and pulling grew weaker and weaker. Eventually his entire body stilled. His chest was no longer moving up and down and the last little bubbles of air left his open mouth. </p><p>All of a sudden Sansa realised that she was not holding her breath. She was breathing. She was underwater and breathing. And when she looked at her legs and feet she noticed they were gone. Instead she was flapping a beautiful black fin. A smile spread across her face and when she looked at Jon she saw how he was smiling back at her.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to see the kingdom?\u201d He hadn\u2019t let go of her hand and Sansa pulled him closer towards her. </p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She whispered. </p><p>But Jon shook his head. \u201cDon&rsquo;t thank me.\u201d He reached for her other hand too and together they were soaring in the water. \u201cI gave you an option, but you did this yourself. You chose this. You chose me.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll never regret it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it.\u201d Sansa pulled him even closer until his chest touched hers. Her arms circled around his neck. \u201cAnd there are always more fish in the sea.\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s arms slid around her waist and then his nose brushed hers. \u201cBut not one as pretty and brave as you.\u201d</p><p>Kissing Jon was everything Sansa had hoped it would be. Instead of all her muscles tensing she felt herself relax. And even though they were surrounded by salted water his lips tasted as sweet as sugar. </p><p>But most of all his kiss was tender and slow. His tongue didn\u2019t touch her lips before she slightly parted them and invited him in.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know if minutes, hours or days had passed when they eventually pulled apart to catch their breaths. \u201cNow I want to see your kingdom.\u201d Her voice sounded a bit hoarse, but Jon tucked a strand of her bright red hair behind her ear. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no my kingdom, princess. It\u2019s yours too now. It\u2019s our kingdom.\u201d</p>",

He had a devilish smirk on his face and there was something gleaming in his eyes that Sansa didn\u2019t quite like. There was actually quite little about him that she liked. \u201cDo you have any special wishes for tonight, my lady?\u201d </p><p>The wind carried his whispers towards her and Sansa straightened her back. \u201cYes.\u201d She spoke firmly. Her eyes scanned the surface of the sea, but she didn\u2019t see Jon anywhere. </p><p>But Jon was a merman. He could be anywhere. Hopefully he was anywhere near. </p><p>\u201cI want to do it in the sea.\u201d</p><p>The smirk on Ramsay\u2019s face brightened and in one smooth movement he pulled his shirt over his head. Looking at his bare chest almost made her throw up and once more she stared at the waves crashing on the beach. </p><p>She took one more deep breath and then she took off her thin summer dress. She didn\u2019t like how Ramsay\u2019s eyes scanned her almost naked body. She didn\u2019t like the tip of his tongue licking his lips while his glance rested on her bra. She most of all didn\u2019t like the sweaty hands he placed on her hips, his thumbs resting on the insides of her thighs. </p><p>\u201cRelax, Sansa Stark.\u201d If his touch was meant to be comforting it failed hopelessly. \u201cJust try to enjoy it. I certainly will.\u201d He pressed his lips on hers and for a moment Sansa was unable to move or kiss him back. But that didn\u2019t seem to bother Ramsay at all. </p><p>The few seconds that passed seemed to last days, but eventually he stepped back and pulled down his pants which gave Sansa the chance to rush into the sea to wash her lips with salted water.</p><p>\u201cGood\u2026\u201d Ramsay wrapped his arms around her and Sansa felt a strange and unwelcome pressure in her back. \u201cYou already made yourself wet.\u201d His hand shove down her stomach into her briefs and Sansa closed her eyes firmly. </p><p>Her lips whispered an endless prayer, but tears were stinging in her eyes when Ramsay\u2019s hand slid between her legs. </p><p>\u201cSansa\u2026\u201d </p><p>Her eyes flashed open again when she heard her name and when she saw Jon\u2019s wet black curls only a few inches away from her she gathered all the courage she had left. </p><p>An unpleasant tingle rolled down her arm when her elbow crashed into Ramsay\u2019s ribcage, but his hand was gone, his arms were gone and when she turned around she saw how dark purple tentacles curled around his wrists and ankles to keep him down in the water.</p><p>\u201cIs this the girl you were talking about, Jon Targaryen?\u201d </p><p>A shiver rolled down Sansa\u2019s back, but Jon appeared next to her and nodded firmly.</p><p>He kept his distance. He didn\u2019t place a hand on her back. He didn\u2019t wrap an arm around her. But he wore a frown on his forehead and he constantly tucked the same black curl behind his ear. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, girl?\u201d </p><p>Sansa didn\u2019t know who was talking, but when she looked at Jon he nodded once more. \u201cSansa Stark.\u201d Instinctively she reached for Jon\u2019s hand and she lifted her chin when their fingers entwined. </p><p>\u201cAnd you are willing to leave the human world behind?\u201d</p><p>The palms of her hands were sweating, but her voice didn\u2019t even tremble. \u201cYes.\u201d </p><p>She had said her goodbyes. She was sure that her parents and siblings hadn\u2019t understood that they were goodbyes, but she assumed they would figure that out soon enough. </p><p>\u201cAnd you understand you can never ever return?\u201d</p><p>She hoped they would all understand why she had done it. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s grip on her hand tightened and he moved a little closer towards her. The heat of his body was comforting. But it was most of all his silence that made her feel at ease. And somehow she knew that if she would change her mind now, he would let her go. </p><p>\u201cHow will you pay for your new life?\u201d </p><p>Sansa looked at Jon and Jon gestured at Ramsay Bolton, who was gasping for air and fighting the tentacles holding him down. \u201cI will pay with the life of Lord Ramsay Bolton.\u201d She kept her eyes firmly on his struggling body.</p><p>Her parents had raised her to be compassionate, but she couldn\u2019t feel any compassion for the man who had promised her nothing but misery. And if that made her a bad person, she liked being one. </p><p>\u201cI accept your payment.\u201d </p><p>Ramsay Bolton could breath one more time before he went under again and this time for good.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to watch him die?\u201d Jon squeezed her hand and when Sansa nodded he dived down and pulled her with him.</p><p>One more time Sansa took a deep breath and with her eyes wide open she followed the crown prince into the depths of the sea. Her sight was surprisingly clear and a strange kind of warmth rushed through her veins when she saw Ramsay looking at her. </p><p>His kicking and pulling grew weaker and weaker. Eventually his entire body stilled. His chest was no longer moving up and down and the last little bubbles of air left his open mouth. </p><p>All of a sudden Sansa realised that she was not holding her breath. She was breathing. She was underwater and breathing. And when she looked at her legs and feet she noticed they were gone. Instead she was flapping a beautiful black fin. A smile spread across her face and when she looked at Jon she saw how he was smiling back at her.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to see the kingdom?\u201d He hadn\u2019t let go of her hand and Sansa pulled him closer towards her. </p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She whispered. </p><p>But Jon shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t thank me.\u201d He reached for her other hand too and together they were soaring in the water. \u201cI gave you an option, but you did this yourself. You chose this. You chose me.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll never regret it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it.\u201d Sansa pulled him even closer until his chest touched hers. Her arms circled around his neck. \u201cAnd there are always more fish in the sea.\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s arms slid around her waist and then his nose brushed hers. \u201cBut not one as pretty and brave as you.\u201d</p><p>Kissing Jon was everything Sansa had hoped it would be. Instead of all her muscles tensing she felt herself relax. And even though they were surrounded by salted water his lips tasted as sweet as sugar. </p><p>But most of all his kiss was tender and slow. His tongue didn\u2019t touch her lips before she slightly parted them and invited him in.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know if minutes, hours or days had passed when they eventually pulled apart to catch their breaths. \u201cNow I want to see your kingdom.\u201d Her voice sounded a bit hoarse, but Jon tucked a strand of her bright red hair behind her ear. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no my kingdom, princess. It\u2019s yours too now. It\u2019s our kingdom.\u201d</p>",
