Thanks to you, for being here, thanks for your support and thanks for put a smile in my face with your messages and comments. I hope that this new year will bring us a lot of light and good things, and of course one of those things is Got final season. For all the friends that I made here throughout the year, those who came and those who left too, I wish you the best! To all my beautiful friends editors, continue doing what you love, because you're making ART and never forget this, something so wonderful that (in my world) can save and help us how you can't imagine. Never feel less than others (even though I've been doing it constantly but also trying to avoid it). Be kind, enjoy the little things of the life and If you feel alone at some point in your life say it, there's always someone willing to listen you, even this girl behind this account in some part of this world. And with Jon and Daenerys happy as I want their end on the tv show I say goodbye to this 2018 and \\&quot;finally you're (almost) here\\&quot; to this 2019. Thank you so soooo much for being part of my life. I love you all!!! \u2764\u2764\u2764 #jonerys #jonerysedit #daenerystargaryen #jonsnow #got #gotseason8 #gameofthrones #emiliaclarke #kitharington #kimilia #kitandemilia #motherofdragons #kinginthenorth #hbo #edit #fanart #dragonstone #daenerys #forthethrone #tumblr #art #drawing #targaryen #stark #asoiaf #like4like #instalike&quot;}}\"><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Br8RmVdn11L/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Thanks to you, for being here, thanks for your support and thanks for put a smile in my face with your messages and comments. I hope that this new year will bring us a lot of light and good things, and of course one of those things is Got final season. For all the friends that I made here throughout the year, those who came and those who left too, I wish you the best! To all my beautiful friends editors, continue doing what you love, because you're making ART and never forget this, something so wonderful that (in my world) can save and help us how you can't imagine. Never feel less than others (even though I've been doing it constantly but also trying to avoid it). Be kind, enjoy the little things of the life and If you feel alone at some point in your life say it, there's always someone willing to listen you, even this girl behind this account in some part of this world. And with Jon and Daenerys happy as I want their end on the tv show I say goodbye to this 2018 and \\&quot;finally you're (almost) here\\&quot; to this 2019. Thank you so soooo much for being part of my life. I love you all!!! \u2764\u2764\u2764 #jonerys #jonerysedit #daenerystargaryen #jonsnow #got #gotseason8 #gameofthrones #emiliaclarke #kitharington #kimilia #kitandemilia #motherofdragons #kinginthenorth #hbo #edit #fanart #dragonstone #daenerys #forthethrone #tumblr #art #drawing #targaryen #stark #asoiaf #like4like #instalike&quot;}}\"><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Br8RmVdn11L/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Thanks to you, for being here, thanks for your support and thanks for put a smile in my face with your messages and comments. I hope that this new year will bring us a lot of light and good things, and of course one of those things is Got final season. For all the friends that I made here throughout the year, those who came and those who left too, I wish you the best! To all my beautiful friends editors, continue doing what you love, because you're making ART and never forget this, something so wonderful that (in my world) can save and help us how you can't imagine. Never feel less than others (even though I've been doing it constantly but also trying to avoid it). Be kind, enjoy the little things of the life and If you feel alone at some point in your life say it, there's always someone willing to listen you, even this girl behind this account in some part of this world. And with Jon and Daenerys happy as I want their end on the tv show I say goodbye to this 2018 and \\&quot;finally you're (almost) here\\&quot; to this 2019. Thank you so soooo much for being part of my life. I love you all!!! \u2764\u2764\u2764 #jonerys #jonerysedit #daenerystargaryen #jonsnow #got #gotseason8 #gameofthrones #emiliaclarke #kitharington #kimilia #kitandemilia #motherofdragons #kinginthenorth #hbo #edit #fanart #dragonstone #daenerys #forthethrone #tumblr #art #drawing #targaryen #stark #asoiaf #like4like #instalike&quot;}}\"><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Br8RmVdn11L/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Thanks to you, for being here, thanks for your support and thanks for put a smile in my face with your messages and comments. I hope that this new year will bring us a lot of light and good things, and of course one of those things is Got final season. For all the friends that I made here throughout the year, those who came and those who left too, I wish you the best! To all my beautiful friends editors, continue doing what you love, because you're making ART and never forget this, something so wonderful that (in my world) can save and help us how you can't imagine. Never feel less than others (even though I've been doing it constantly but also trying to avoid it). Be kind, enjoy the little things of the life and If you feel alone at some point in your life say it, there's always someone willing to listen you, even this girl behind this account in some part of this world. And with Jon and Daenerys happy as I want their end on the tv show I say goodbye to this 2018 and \\&quot;finally you're (almost) here\\&quot; to this 2019. Thank you so soooo much for being part of my life. I love you all!!! &#10084;&#10084;&#10084; #jonerys #jonerysedit #daenerystargaryen #jonsnow #got #gotseason8 #gameofthrones #emiliaclarke #kitharington #kimilia #kitandemilia #motherofdragons #kinginthenorth #hbo #edit #fanart #dragonstone #daenerys #forthethrone #tumblr #art #drawing #targaryen #stark #asoiaf #like4like #instalike&quot;}}\"><blockquote> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Br8RmVdn11L/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\">       View this post on Instagram            </a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Br8RmVdn11L/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by &#8213; game of thrones &#10085; (@stormbornchild)</a> on Dec 28, 2018 at 10:54am PST</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"#\"><img src=\"https://assets.tumblr.com/images/inline_placeholder.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"14\"/></a></p></figure><p>&#128150;&#128150;&#128150; Per<b>fection &#128150;&#128150;</b>&#128150;&#128150;</p><p>Now THIS is what I want to see on the promotional pictures for S8 </p></p>",

Y/N shivered as she filled a bucket with icy water and turned back to the castle. Winterfell looked so different than she remembered it: The majestic walls and the once splendid looking towers Bran used to climb were now darkened due to the enormous fires that were lit at all times to burn the meat of animals and men. Yes, Winterfell had indeed changed. But she tried not to think about those times often, it made her too sad. Luckily, she had been up early today. This way she escaped some of the sexually suggestive comments by the wards that were to guard the prisoners. Y/N pitied them. Living with Ramsay when he was happy was already horrific, she didn&rsquo;t dare to picture him when in a bad mood. She hurried inside and brushed the snow off her boots. At least, it was a bit warmer than outside, she thought bitterly. She observed the hall carefully after pouring the water into another bucket that stood by the door. She spotted Reek on the other side of the hall and quickly went over to him. Usually he was nice to her, because he was afraid that he&rsquo;d displease Ramsay if he didn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;G-Good morning, m'lady&rdquo;, he stuttered and stopped lighting  candles. Y/N gave him a reassuring smile and said :&ldquo;Do you know where Rickon is?&quot;Reek quickly shook his head, looking as nervous as ever. Y/N suppressed a sigh and nodded, turning to the nearest staircase. In her chamber, she couldn&rsquo;t help but cry a bit. She went to her window and looked outside : A snow storm was rising and brought back her memories. She missed Osha. And Arya and Sansa and Bran and Robb and Jon. Especially Jon. She grew up in a village near Winterfell and worked in the bakery of her parents. Because of Sansas addiction to lemon cakes she had been in the castle quite often. That&rsquo;s how she had met Jon, as well. When she first had laid her eyes on him, she had fallen for him. After a while, they started to spend more time together and something like love had developed since Jon and Y/N shared their first kiss in the stables. But he had grown more reserved and when Y/N learned that he was taking the black because of his heritage, she was furious. He was too honorable,but she would have given everything to see him again. After Robb had died and the Boltons took over Winterfell, nothing was like before. Y/N had been able to escape, earning her money by working in brothels and finally joined the duo after hearing that they were heading north. Unfortunately, they got caught and were now in the grasp of Ramsay. Y/N wasn&rsquo;t allowed to leave the castle grounds and she had to be his  &quot;wife&rdquo; (aka his whore). She was aware that at the tiniest mistake, he&rsquo;d have her head. Sighing, she turned from the window and the swirling snowflakes and decided to try and sleep for a bit. But when she moved towards her small, hard bed, she noticed a piece of paper, lying on the matress. With shaky hands she picked it up.  &lsquo;Dearest wife, please forgive me&rsquo;&hellip;? Before she could comprehend the words , a calloused hand clamped over her mouth and pulled her into complete darkness. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to make any sound right now, trust me &rdquo;, was whispered into her ear before the world went pitch black. </p><p>When she awoke, she felt worn out and thirsty. As the memories came flooding back, so did the panic. She tried to move, but she was bound to a -horse? She couldn&rsquo;t see either, because a tie on her eyes made everything a dark grey. She tried to calm herself. She wouldn&rsquo;t be hurt. She thought about Jon and eventually fell asleep after a while. When she woke up again, the tie had been lifted from her eyes and she saw that she was indeed sitting on a brown horse one of a hundred horses with soldiers upon them. Nervously, her eyes flew over a great, muddy field. Then she looked to the right and her heart stopped. With a sadistic grin plastered on his lips, Ramsay watched her intensely. &ldquo;My wife! &rdquo;, he exclaimed softly and with an excited spark in his eyes. &ldquo;I apologize for your uncomfortable transport. Sadly, it was the only way to be sure you won&rsquo;t try something.. Naughty. And you know what happens with naughty girls, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Y/N squeezed her eyes shut as images of skinned and crippled women invaded her mind.&ldquo; I do know that you would like to escape, rather than staying here with me. That.. disappoints me, pet&rdquo;, he whispered gently into her ear. She shuddered involuntarily. He leaned back. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk about that later. Now, I&rsquo;ve brought you to enjoy the show. A certain bastard of Ned Stark is coming to reclaim his father&rsquo;s castle and his brother - and I wonder if he even is familiar with you?&rdquo; He winked at her. He couldn&rsquo;t be talking about Jon, could he? Suddenly, the sound of hooves interrupted him and he straightened his back.&ldquo; Soldiers! &rdquo;, he shouted. The rows of men suddenly were well - ordered and armed. She tried  to make out any faces of the opposite front, but  could only see horses. As they came closer , she spotted <i>it.</i> A huge white shadow, running next to a black horse on which sat- <i>him</i>. He had grown taller and sturdier since the last time she saw him. His black curls were held back in a bun and he looked like he aged twenty years - from sorrows, she supposed. Her heart ached at the sight of him and all she wanted to do was to be held by him, finally safe. But it wasn&rsquo;t over yet. She prayed to all the gods she knew that he wouldn&rsquo;t do something heroic. &ldquo;Snow!&rdquo; Ramsay yelled across the battlefield. &ldquo;I heard you wanted my toys back? Well, I&rsquo;ve got them right here!&rdquo; With this words he pulled her in front of him. His horse whickered nervously. He then pulled at a rope that laid over the horse&rsquo;s back. Rickon stumbled over to them, his doe eyes widened and looking at her.&ldquo; Do you like games, little lord? &rdquo; Rickon didn&rsquo;t move. &ldquo;Go on then, run to your brother.&rdquo; He pointed at the other side of the field. She  inhaled sharply when he pulled out a flying knife, brought it down and - cut through the rope that held Rickons hands together. He looked at her with disbelief and started to slowly go towards the field.&ldquo; You have to turn around and run. Walking isn&rsquo;t playing by the rules..&quot;Rickon turned around and started to run. She then saw Ramsay pulling out a bow.&rdquo; Run, Rickon! &ldquo;, she cried out. On the other side, Jon had started to gallop towards him at a insane pace.&rdquo; They&rsquo;re gonna make it&quot;, Y/N muttered to herself. Ramsay watched her, clearly amused. &ldquo;Oh, you think so love?&rdquo; He put in his last arrow. Jon was almost there when - the arrow broke through Rickon&rsquo;s back.</p><p> Y/N couldn&rsquo;t feel anymore. Through her wet lashes, she saw Jon dismounting his horse, heard Ramsay&rsquo;s shouts and flying arrows. The next hour was a nightmare come true. Everywhere around her, men and horses were dying, whimpering in death pain. Ramsay growled in disapproval. After some time, Y/N started to realize how the  bolton soldiers started to die like flies. Apparently, fresh soldiers from the Eyrie had arrived and it looked like - Jon was winning. Ramsay turned his horse around roughly, with her still before him and rode back to Winterfell. </p><p>Y/N was forced to stand next to him when he promised his men they were safe and should just ignore the giant in front of their door. Suddenly, the wood crashed. Ramsay killed the giant almost immediately and then turned to Jon who stood next to his dead protector. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve already lost one of your precious treasures, bastard, would you truly risk losing another?&rdquo; With this words, he pulled her in front of him, holding a knife to her throat. She searched for Jon&rsquo;s eyes and practically begged for him not to save her. But he came stomping towards them, his anger radiating off him. Although Ramsay tried to hide behind his men, he was by her in a second and pushed Ramsay in the dirt. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t hurt her anymore &rdquo;, he pressed out through gritted teeth and punshed Ramsay in the face - again and again, until his face was completely bloodied. Then, Jon pushed his sword through his throat. Ramsay laughed and gurgled one last time and then-it was over. Jon turned to her, his anger still apparent. But his eyes immediately softened as she began to run towards him. He caught her by the waist as she jumped onto him and nuzzled her head into the crook of his head. He deeply inhaled her soothing and familiar scent. She started sobbing into his curls as they stood like that for what felt like eternity. Y/N was the one to pull back first. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re hurt&rdquo;, she stated and observed the gashes on his chest. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing, my love&rdquo;, he reassured her. &ldquo;Did he hurt you? &rdquo; She silently shook her head, tears in her eyes. Jon started to cry too. It was a deep, animalistic sound, full of pain and Y/N couldn&rsquo;t bear it. &ldquo;Rickon, I should have saved him.. All these men, dying for me..&rdquo; He started to cry harder and pulled her closer. &ldquo;Shh, it&rsquo;s okay&rdquo;, Y/N told him with a shaking voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay..&quot;With her cheeks still wet, she pulled him down for a kiss.

Y/N shivered as she filled a bucket with icy water and turned back to the castle. Winterfell looked so different than she remembered it: The majestic walls and the once splendid looking towers Bran used to climb were now darkened due to the enormous fires that were lit at all times to burn the meat of animals and men. Yes, Winterfell had indeed changed. But she tried not to think about those times often, it made her too sad. Luckily, she had been up early today. This way she escaped some of the sexually suggestive comments by the wards that were to guard the prisoners. Y/N pitied them. Living with Ramsay when he was happy was already horrific, she didn\u2019t dare to picture him when in a bad mood. She hurried inside and brushed the snow off her boots. At least, it was a bit warmer than outside, she thought bitterly. She observed the hall carefully after pouring the water into another bucket that stood by the door. She spotted Reek on the other side of the hall and quickly went over to him. Usually he was nice to her, because he was afraid that he\u2019d displease Ramsay if he didn\u2019t. \u201cG-Good morning, m'lady\u201d, he stuttered and stopped lighting  candles. Y/N gave him a reassuring smile and said :\u201cDo you know where Rickon is?\"Reek quickly shook his head, looking as nervous as ever. Y/N suppressed a sigh and nodded, turning to the nearest staircase. In her chamber, she couldn\u2019t help but cry a bit. She went to her window and looked outside : A snow storm was rising and brought back her memories. She missed Osha. And Arya and Sansa and Bran and Robb and Jon. Especially Jon. She grew up in a village near Winterfell and worked in the bakery of her parents. Because of Sansas addiction to lemon cakes she had been in the castle quite often. That\u2019s how she had met Jon, as well. When she first had laid her eyes on him, she had fallen for him. After a while, they started to spend more time together and something like love had developed since Jon and Y/N shared their first kiss in the stables. But he had grown more reserved and when Y/N learned that he was taking the black because of his heritage, she was furious. He was too honorable,but she would have given everything to see him again. After Robb had died and the Boltons took over Winterfell, nothing was like before. Y/N had been able to escape, earning her money by working in brothels and finally joined the duo after hearing that they were heading north. Unfortunately, they got caught and were now in the grasp of Ramsay. Y/N wasn\u2019t allowed to leave the castle grounds and she had to be his  \"wife\u201d (aka his whore). She was aware that at the tiniest mistake, he\u2019d have her head. Sighing, she turned from the window and the swirling snowflakes and decided to try and sleep for a bit. But when she moved towards her small, hard bed, she noticed a piece of paper, lying on the matress. With shaky hands she picked it up.  \u2018Dearest wife, please forgive me\u2019\u2026? Before she could comprehend the words , a calloused hand clamped over her mouth and pulled her into complete darkness. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to make any sound right now, trust me \u201d, was whispered into her ear before the world went pitch black. </p><p>When she awoke, she felt worn out and thirsty. As the memories came flooding back, so did the panic. She tried to move, but she was bound to a -horse? She couldn\u2019t see either, because a tie on her eyes made everything a dark grey. She tried to calm herself. She wouldn\u2019t be hurt. She thought about Jon and eventually fell asleep after a while. When she woke up again, the tie had been lifted from her eyes and she saw that she was indeed sitting on a brown horse one of a hundred horses with soldiers upon them. Nervously, her eyes flew over a great, muddy field. Then she looked to the right and her heart stopped. With a sadistic grin plastered on his lips, Ramsay watched her intensely. \u201cMy wife! \u201d, he exclaimed softly and with an excited spark in his eyes. \u201cI apologize for your uncomfortable transport. Sadly, it was the only way to be sure you won\u2019t try something.. Naughty. And you know what happens with naughty girls, don\u2019t you?\u201d Y/N squeezed her eyes shut as images of skinned and crippled women invaded her mind.\u201c I do know that you would like to escape, rather than staying here with me. That.. disappoints me, pet\u201d, he whispered gently into her ear. She shuddered involuntarily. He leaned back. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about that later. Now, I\u2019ve brought you to enjoy the show. A certain bastard of Ned Stark is coming to reclaim his father\u2019s castle and his brother - and I wonder if he even is familiar with you?\u201d He winked at her. He couldn\u2019t be talking about Jon, could he? Suddenly, the sound of hooves interrupted him and he straightened his back.\u201c Soldiers! \u201d, he shouted. The rows of men suddenly were well - ordered and armed. She tried  to make out any faces of the opposite front, but  could only see horses. As they came closer , she spotted <i>it.</i> A huge white shadow, running next to a black horse on which sat- <i>him</i>. He had grown taller and sturdier since the last time she saw him. His black curls were held back in a bun and he looked like he aged twenty years - from sorrows, she supposed. Her heart ached at the sight of him and all she wanted to do was to be held by him, finally safe. But it wasn\u2019t over yet. She prayed to all the gods she knew that he wouldn\u2019t do something heroic. \u201cSnow!\u201d Ramsay yelled across the battlefield. \u201cI heard you wanted my toys back? Well, I\u2019ve got them right here!\u201d With this words he pulled her in front of him. His horse whickered nervously. He then pulled at a rope that laid over the horse\u2019s back. Rickon stumbled over to them, his doe eyes widened and looking at her.\u201c Do you like games, little lord? \u201d Rickon didn\u2019t move. \u201cGo on then, run to your brother.\u201d He pointed at the other side of the field. She  inhaled sharply when he pulled out a flying knife, brought it down and - cut through the rope that held Rickons hands together. He looked at her with disbelief and started to slowly go towards the field.\u201c You have to turn around and run. Walking isn\u2019t playing by the rules..\"Rickon turned around and started to run. She then saw Ramsay pulling out a bow.\u201d Run, Rickon! \u201c, she cried out. On the other side, Jon had started to gallop towards him at a insane pace.\u201d They\u2019re gonna make it\", Y/N muttered to herself. Ramsay watched her, clearly amused. \u201cOh, you think so love?\u201d He put in his last arrow. Jon was almost there when - the arrow broke through Rickon\u2019s back.</p><p> Y/N couldn\u2019t feel anymore. Through her wet lashes, she saw Jon dismounting his horse, heard Ramsay\u2019s shouts and flying arrows. The next hour was a nightmare come true. Everywhere around her, men and horses were dying, whimpering in death pain. Ramsay growled in disapproval. After some time, Y/N started to realize how the  bolton soldiers started to die like flies. Apparently, fresh soldiers from the Eyrie had arrived and it looked like - Jon was winning. Ramsay turned his horse around roughly, with her still before him and rode back to Winterfell. </p><p>Y/N was forced to stand next to him when he promised his men they were safe and should just ignore the giant in front of their door. Suddenly, the wood crashed. Ramsay killed the giant almost immediately and then turned to Jon who stood next to his dead protector. \u201cYou\u2019ve already lost one of your precious treasures, bastard, would you truly risk losing another?\u201d With this words, he pulled her in front of him, holding a knife to her throat. She searched for Jon\u2019s eyes and practically begged for him not to save her. But he came stomping towards them, his anger radiating off him. Although Ramsay tried to hide behind his men, he was by her in a second and pushed Ramsay in the dirt. \u201cYou won\u2019t hurt her anymore \u201d, he pressed out through gritted teeth and punshed Ramsay in the face - again and again, until his face was completely bloodied. Then, Jon pushed his sword through his throat. Ramsay laughed and gurgled one last time and then-it was over. Jon turned to her, his anger still apparent. But his eyes immediately softened as she began to run towards him. He caught her by the waist as she jumped onto him and nuzzled her head into the crook of his head. He deeply inhaled her soothing and familiar scent. She started sobbing into his curls as they stood like that for what felt like eternity. Y/N was the one to pull back first. \u201cYou\u2019re hurt\u201d, she stated and observed the gashes on his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, my love\u201d, he reassured her. \u201cDid he hurt you? \u201d She silently shook her head, tears in her eyes. Jon started to cry too. It was a deep, animalistic sound, full of pain and Y/N couldn\u2019t bear it. \u201cRickon, I should have saved him.. All these men, dying for me..\u201d He started to cry harder and pulled her closer. \u201cShh, it\u2019s okay\u201d, Y/N told him with a shaking voice. \u201cIt\u2019s okay..\"With her cheeks still wet, she pulled him down for a kiss. Jon immediately responded and brought his hand up behind her neck to deepen the kiss and snaked his other arm around her waist. They were alive. Gods, they were alive.</p></p>",

When she woke up again, the tie had been lifted from her eyes and she saw that she was indeed sitting on a brown horse one of a hundred horses with soldiers upon them. Nervously, her eyes flew over a great, muddy field. Then she looked to the right and her heart stopped. With a sadistic grin plastered on his lips, Ramsay watched her intensely. &ldquo;My wife! &rdquo;, he exclaimed softly and with an excited spark in his eyes. &ldquo;I apologize for your uncomfortable transport. Sadly, it was the only way to be sure you won&rsquo;t try something.. Naughty. And you know what happens with naughty girls, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Y/N squeezed her eyes shut as images of skinned and crippled women invaded her mind.&ldquo; I do know that you would like to escape, rather than staying here with me. That.. disappoints me, pet&rdquo;, he whispered gently into her ear. She shuddered involuntarily. He leaned back. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk about that later. Now, I&rsquo;ve brought you to enjoy the show. A certain bastard of Ned Stark is coming to reclaim his father&rsquo;s castle and his brother - and I wonder if he even is familiar with you?&rdquo; He winked at her. He couldn&rsquo;t be talking about Jon, could he? Suddenly, the sound of hooves interrupted him and he straightened his back.&ldquo; Soldiers! &rdquo;, he shouted. The rows of men suddenly were well - ordered and armed. She tried  to make out any faces of the opposite front, but  could only see horses. As they came closer , she spotted <i>it.</i> A huge white shadow, running next to a black horse on which sat- <i>him</i>. He had grown taller and sturdier since the last time she saw him. His black curls were held back in a bun and he looked like he aged twenty years - from sorrows, she supposed. Her heart ached at the sight of him and all she wanted to do was to be held by him, finally safe. But it wasn&rsquo;t over yet. She prayed to all the gods she knew that he wouldn&rsquo;t do something heroic. &ldquo;Snow!&rdquo; Ramsay yelled across the battlefield. &ldquo;I heard you wanted my toys back? Well, I&rsquo;ve got them right here!&rdquo; With this words he pulled her in front of him. His horse whickered nervously. He then pulled at a rope that laid over the horse&rsquo;s back. Rickon stumbled over to them, his doe eyes widened and looking at her.&ldquo; Do you like games, little lord? &rdquo; Rickon didn&rsquo;t move. &ldquo;Go on then, run to your brother.&rdquo; He pointed at the other side of the field. She  inhaled sharply when he pulled out a flying knife, brought it down and - cut through the rope that held Rickons hands together. He looked at her with disbelief and started to slowly go towards the field.&ldquo; You have to turn around and run. Walking isn&rsquo;t playing by the rules..\"Rickon turned around and started to run. She then saw Ramsay pulling out a bow.&rdquo; Run, Rickon! &ldquo;, she cried out. On the other side, Jon had started to gallop towards him at a insane pace.&rdquo; They&rsquo;re gonna make it\", Y/N muttered to herself. Ramsay watched her, clearly amused. &ldquo;Oh, you think so love?&rdquo; He put in his last arrow. Jon was almost there when - the arrow broke through Rickon&rsquo;s back.</p><p> Y/N couldn&rsquo;t feel anymore. Through her wet lashes, she saw Jon dismounting his horse, heard Ramsay&rsquo;s shouts and flying arrows. The next hour was a nightmare come true. Everywhere around her, men and horses were dying, whimpering in death pain. Ramsay growled in disapproval. After some time, Y/N started to realize how the  bolton soldiers started to die like flies. Apparently, fresh soldiers from the Eyrie had arrived and it looked like - Jon was winning. Ramsay turned his horse around roughly, with her still before him and rode back to Winterfell. </p><p>Y/N was forced to stand next to him when he promised his men they were safe and should just ignore the giant in front of their door. Suddenly, the wood crashed. Ramsay killed the giant almost immediately and then turned to Jon who stood next to his dead protector. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve already lost one of your precious treasures, bastard, would you truly risk losing another?&rdquo; With this words, he pulled her in front of him, holding a knife to her throat. She searched for Jon&rsquo;s eyes and practically begged for him not to save her. But he came stomping towards them, his anger radiating off him. Although Ramsay tried to hide behind his men, he was by her in a second and pushed Ramsay in the dirt. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t hurt her anymore &rdquo;, he pressed out through gritted teeth and punshed Ramsay in the face - again and again, until his face was completely bloodied. Then, Jon pushed his sword through his throat. Ramsay laughed and gurgled one last time and then-it was over. Jon turned to her, his anger still apparent. But his eyes immediately softened as she began to run towards him. He caught her by the waist as she jumped onto him and nuzzled her head into the crook of his head. He deeply inhaled her soothing and familiar scent. She started sobbing into his curls as they stood like that for what felt like eternity. Y/N was the one to pull back first. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re hurt&rdquo;, she stated and observed the gashes on his chest. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing, my love&rdquo;, he reassured her. &ldquo;Did he hurt you? &rdquo; She silently shook her head, tears in her eyes. Jon started to cry too. It was a deep, animalistic sound, full of pain and Y/N couldn&rsquo;t bear it. &ldquo;Rickon, I should have saved him.. All these men, dying for me..&rdquo; He started to cry harder and pulled her closer. &ldquo;Shh, it&rsquo;s okay&rdquo;, Y/N told him with a shaking voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay..\"With her cheeks still wet, she pulled him down for a kiss. Jon immediately responded and brought his hand up behind her neck to deepen the kiss and snaked his other arm around her waist. They were alive. Gods, they were alive.</p></p>",
