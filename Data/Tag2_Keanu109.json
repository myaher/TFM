And the two of you certainly never spoke about the heated kiss in the bathroom, that Cillian had so rudely interrupted before things got too steamy. You had been snarky at him when he drove you home. He caught on in the end, but refused to even let you explain, saying that you were\u00a0\u2018like a daughter to him,\u2019 and that he\u00a0\u2018didn\u2019t need to know everything that was happening.\u2019 You had talked to Yvonne about it, and she had been giddy with excitement, but swore herself to secrecy.</p><p>Keanu had also taken up the job onset, he was one of the lead actors in the film and Cillian and yourself were opposite him. The three of you worked well off of each other, and due to Keanu\u2019s and Chris\u2019 star power, word got around quick that the two of them were doing another movie together. You and Cillian sat back and watched the twitter world explode with a countless number of tweets from excited fans from both their sides of the twitter-verse. You had sworn to yourself to be like Cillian and refuse any form of social media, and you were pretty proud of yourself for making it this far.</p><p>There was one day on set in particular that you remembered vividly in your mind like nothing else. Chris and Cillian were giving each other notes and tips from the last scene that Cillian had filmed, while you and Keanu snuck back into the trailer for lunch and a quick conversation before the two of you were needed again. Keanu had been very upfront.\u00a0\u201cSo how long have you had a thing for Chris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that good of an actor huh?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t dance around the question.\u201d<br/></p><p>You had told him everything, from the moment the two of you met, to the moments leading up to the cafe conversation, but you skipped over the bathroom scene. He got the picture nonetheless.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s a very long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d<br/></p><p>And, as the great Keanu Reeves leaned back in his chair and watched Chris Evans approach the trailer to get the two of you ready, he whispered,\u00a0\u201cyou two would be cute together.\u201d</p><p>Finally, filming came to a close and all the actors were given the day off of set. Chris had to stay and look over some things, and because you felt like you owed him for getting him to take up the mantle as the director, you headed downtown to get him a cup of coffee before returning to set. He was in his and Cillian\u2019s trailer by the time you showed up, and Cillian had gone home for his son\u2019s birthday, so there was no chance he could walk in again, so you decided it was now or never.</p><p>You knocked on the door, heart leaping into your throat as you held onto the coffees in your hands in a tight grip. When he answered, he had a towel draped loosely over his hips and a smile curved onto his face. He seemed genuinely happy to see you, those blue eyes alive with excitement.\u00a0\u201cYou brought me coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d you replied, taking the steps up towards him.\u00a0\u201cThought it was my ticket in to talk to you.\u201d<br/></p><p>He nodded, stepping aside so you could walk in and take a seat at the table. Chris looked conflicted, like he didn\u2019t know whether or not to get himself dressed, or stay in the towel. Ultimately, he sat down across from you, those eyes never leaving yours even when he brought the coffee to his lips.\u00a0\u201cWhat did you want to talk about, Miss y/n?\u201d</p><p>You shrugged.\u00a0\u201cAnything and everything,\u201d you teased, running your finger over the brim of the cup.\u00a0\u201cAnd about the kiss.\u201d</p><p>He tensed up.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry for that,\u201d he said, his tone was hard to define.\u00a0\u201cI should\u2019ve given you space. You had just broken up with your boyfriend and it wasn\u2019t right of me to come onto you like that. Especially because your so young-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t step away,\u201d was all you said, setting your coffee down on the table so you could stand in front of him.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve wanted you from the moment we met, but I know that <i>that </i>was definitely not the right time for either of us.\u201d<br/></p><p>Chris looked up at you, his hands reaching up and rubbing soothing circles against your waist. His thumbs pushed the hem of you shirt up slightly, and he leaned forward, his lips attaching themselves to the skin of you stomach and sucking and biting on it until he knew a hickey would appear. You could barely contain yourself, the feeling alone making you weak at the knees and almost making them buckle underneath your weight.</p><p>He moved away.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re not too fussed about the age difference?\u201d He asked, his lips red and swollen. When you shook your head you sat down on his lap, your jeans doing nothing to conceal the feeling of him beneath you. You knew that there was sexual tension between the two of you, but you didn\u2019t know there was this much, and as you felt him grind against you with everything he had your mind almost blanked.\u00a0\u201cMaybe we should take this home?\u201d</p><p>You pressed a heated kiss to his neck, but could resist yourself at getting at least one of you off before the two of you got back to his house. You moved the towel away, and grabbed onto him in a loose but firm grip, making him buck against you hand in a way you hadn\u2019t seen before, as though he was letting himself get lost in the feeling. His head fell back, his mouth parting open as you moved your hand up and down, not sure when to stop. Tom had never enjoyed getting a handjob, he thought it was too childish, but the way that Chris moved under your touch, his muscles rippling as pleasure overtook him completely had your own body alive with ecstasy.</p><p>Finally, his head shot back up, one of his hands going to the back of you head and pushing you forward into a sloppy kiss, and the other covered yours around his dick, helping you get to a pace that was going to get him high quicker, and it did. He moaned into your mouth, but his hand never stopped moving as his muscles tightened and he came, hard and heavy. His chest heaving. He broke away from you, those eyes still dark with lust.</p><p>He fixed the towel around his waist and lifted you up onto the table in front of him. His dizziness from his orgasm almost making him topple backwards as he got your jeans undone and began to pull them down your legs. You kept your gaze on him, not sure where else to look as he pressed a kiss to your inner thigh and moved your underwear out of the way as his fingers traced up and down between your shaking legs. He pushed two of them in without a moments hesitation, your eyes screwing shut at the feeling, as he dragged them slowly in and out, the pads of his fingertips grazing the inside of your vagina as he moved.</p><p>You were squirming underneath him, barely able to breathe, but as he added a third finger and brushed his thumb against your clit, that was when he through you closer to the edge. You moaned loud and without any embarrassment, arching up into his touch to connect you lips, but he just pushed you back down as his face joined his fingers between your legs.\u00a0\u201cChris!\u201d</p><p>The pleasure of his tongue against you was almost unbearable and when you finally hit the edge, you cried out, your orgasm rippling through you like you couldn\u2019t contain it. He coursed you through it, and as you came down from your high, his finger retracted, and his mouth attached to your neck to give you a quick kiss before he stood up.</p><p>He dropped the towel, and you felt a jolt of fear course through you without warning. He was bigger than Tom, way, <i>way </i>bigger than Tom. You had only become accustomed to Tom\u2019s size after a few instances of intimacy, but Chris was going to take a lot more than that. He seemed to notice you hesitation, and brought you in for a slow, but sensual kiss, it was slow, and it made you relax in his arms. Your heard him curse as he tried to adjust to get around the table, and you giggled breathlessly, only to hear him join in a few moments later.\u00a0</p><p>He looked around the room quickly, gazing at his discarded jeans and the wallet against the counter. He went to walk over, but you sat up.\u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t need protection,\u201d you assured him, watching his body relax.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m on the pill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFan-fucking-tastic.\u201d</p><p>You wasted no time and got your top half undressed, and Chris watched you in awe, as you discarded your shirt and bra on the ground beside you. He pulled your drenched underwear down your legs and positioned himself, not before bringing you into his arms so he could whisper something in your ear.\u00a0\u201cI love what you\u2019ve done with the place.\u201d</p><p>You slapped his arm and tried to contain your laughter.\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t think we\u2019d make it back to the house anyway,\u201d you said, gazing up at him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAt least I got like two steps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, backward.\u201d</p><p>Chris chuckled as he leaned forward, attaching his lips to yours to distract you from what was happening below. He pushed himself in, and it burned, the stretch was painful and sending jolts of panic up your spine, but you were so lost in the kiss you didn\u2019t give into it. After a while it dissipated, and you wrapped your legs around his waist as he began to move in and out of you, his lips then attaching themselves to the sensitive area of skin just below your ear.

And the two of you certainly never spoke about the heated kiss in the bathroom, that Cillian had so rudely interrupted before things got too steamy. You had been snarky at him when he drove you home. He caught on in the end, but refused to even let you explain, saying that you were\u00a0\u2018like a daughter to him,\u2019 and that he\u00a0\u2018didn\u2019t need to know everything that was happening.\u2019 You had talked to Yvonne about it, and she had been giddy with excitement, but swore herself to secrecy.</p><p>Keanu had also taken up the job onset, he was one of the lead actors in the film and Cillian and yourself were opposite him. The three of you worked well off of each other, and due to Keanu\u2019s and Chris\u2019 star power, word got around quick that the two of them were doing another movie together. You and Cillian sat back and watched the twitter world explode with a countless number of tweets from excited fans from both their sides of the twitter-verse. You had sworn to yourself to be like Cillian and refuse any form of social media, and you were pretty proud of yourself for making it this far.</p><p>There was one day on set in particular that you remembered vividly in your mind like nothing else. Chris and Cillian were giving each other notes and tips from the last scene that Cillian had filmed, while you and Keanu snuck back into the trailer for lunch and a quick conversation before the two of you were needed again. Keanu had been very upfront.\u00a0\u201cSo how long have you had a thing for Chris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that good of an actor huh?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t dance around the question.\u201d<br></p><p>You had told him everything, from the moment the two of you met, to the moments leading up to the cafe conversation, but you skipped over the bathroom scene. He got the picture nonetheless.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s a very long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d<br></p><p>And, as the great Keanu Reeves leaned back in his chair and watched Chris Evans approach the trailer to get the two of you ready, he whispered,\u00a0\u201cyou two would be cute together.\u201d</p><p>Finally, filming came to a close and all the actors were given the day off of set. Chris had to stay and look over some things, and because you felt like you owed him for getting him to take up the mantle as the director, you headed downtown to get him a cup of coffee before returning to set. He was in his and Cillian\u2019s trailer by the time you showed up, and Cillian had gone home for his son\u2019s birthday, so there was no chance he could walk in again, so you decided it was now or never.</p><p>You knocked on the door, heart leaping into your throat as you held onto the coffees in your hands in a tight grip. When he answered, he had a towel draped loosely over his hips and a smile curved onto his face. He seemed genuinely happy to see you, those blue eyes alive with excitement.\u00a0\u201cYou brought me coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d you replied, taking the steps up towards him.\u00a0\u201cThought it was my ticket in to talk to you.\u201d<br></p><p>He nodded, stepping aside so you could walk in and take a seat at the table. Chris looked conflicted, like he didn\u2019t know whether or not to get himself dressed, or stay in the towel. Ultimately, he sat down across from you, those eyes never leaving yours even when he brought the coffee to his lips.\u00a0\u201cWhat did you want to talk about, Miss y/n?\u201d</p><p>You shrugged.\u00a0\u201cAnything and everything,\u201d you teased, running your finger over the brim of the cup.\u00a0\u201cAnd about the kiss.\u201d</p><p>He tensed up.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry for that,\u201d he said, his tone was hard to define.\u00a0\u201cI should\u2019ve given you space. You had just broken up with your boyfriend and it wasn\u2019t right of me to come onto you like that. Especially because your so young-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t step away,\u201d was all you said, setting your coffee down on the table so you could stand in front of him.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve wanted you from the moment we met, but I know that <i>that </i>was definitely not the right time for either of us.\u201d<br></p><p>Chris looked up at you, his hands reaching up and rubbing soothing circles against your waist. His thumbs pushed the hem of you shirt up slightly, and he leaned forward, his lips attaching themselves to the skin of you stomach and sucking and biting on it until he knew a hickey would appear. You could barely contain yourself, the feeling alone making you weak at the knees and almost making them buckle underneath your weight.</p><p>He moved away.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re not too fussed about the age difference?\u201d He asked, his lips red and swollen. When you shook your head you sat down on his lap, your jeans doing nothing to conceal the feeling of him beneath you. You knew that there was sexual tension between the two of you, but you didn\u2019t know there was this much, and as you felt him grind against you with everything he had your mind almost blanked.\u00a0\u201cMaybe we should take this home?\u201d</p><p>You pressed a heated kiss to his neck, but could resist yourself at getting at least one of you off before the two of you got back to his house. You moved the towel away, and grabbed onto him in a loose but firm grip, making him buck against you hand in a way you hadn\u2019t seen before, as though he was letting himself get lost in the feeling. His head fell back, his mouth parting open as you moved your hand up and down, not sure when to stop. Tom had never enjoyed getting a handjob, he thought it was too childish, but the way that Chris moved under your touch, his muscles rippling as pleasure overtook him completely had your own body alive with ecstasy.</p><p>Finally, his head shot back up, one of his hands going to the back of you head and pushing you forward into a sloppy kiss, and the other covered yours around his dick, helping you get to a pace that was going to get him high quicker, and it did. He moaned into your mouth, but his hand never stopped moving as his muscles tightened and he came, hard and heavy. His chest heaving. He broke away from you, those eyes still dark with lust.</p><p>He fixed the towel around his waist and lifted you up onto the table in front of him. His dizziness from his orgasm almost making him topple backwards as he got your jeans undone and began to pull them down your legs. You kept your gaze on him, not sure where else to look as he pressed a kiss to your inner thigh and moved your underwear out of the way as his fingers traced up and down between your shaking legs. He pushed two of them in without a moments hesitation, your eyes screwing shut at the feeling, as he dragged them slowly in and out, the pads of his fingertips grazing the inside of your vagina as he moved.</p><p>You were squirming underneath him, barely able to breathe, but as he added a third finger and brushed his thumb against your clit, that was when he through you closer to the edge. You moaned loud and without any embarrassment, arching up into his touch to connect you lips, but he just pushed you back down as his face joined his fingers between your legs.\u00a0\u201cChris!\u201d</p><p>The pleasure of his tongue against you was almost unbearable and when you finally hit the edge, you cried out, your orgasm rippling through you like you couldn\u2019t contain it. He coursed you through it, and as you came down from your high, his finger retracted, and his mouth attached to your neck to give you a quick kiss before he stood up.</p><p>He dropped the towel, and you felt a jolt of fear course through you without warning. He was bigger than Tom, way, <i>way </i>bigger than Tom. You had only become accustomed to Tom\u2019s size after a few instances of intimacy, but Chris was going to take a lot more than that. He seemed to notice you hesitation, and brought you in for a slow, but sensual kiss, it was slow, and it made you relax in his arms. Your heard him curse as he tried to adjust to get around the table, and you giggled breathlessly, only to hear him join in a few moments later.\u00a0</p><p>He looked around the room quickly, gazing at his discarded jeans and the wallet against the counter. He went to walk over, but you sat up.\u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t need protection,\u201d you assured him, watching his body relax.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m on the pill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFan-fucking-tastic.\u201d</p><p>You wasted no time and got your top half undressed, and Chris watched you in awe, as you discarded your shirt and bra on the ground beside you. He pulled your drenched underwear down your legs and positioned himself, not before bringing you into his arms so he could whisper something in your ear.\u00a0\u201cI love what you\u2019ve done with the place.\u201d</p><p>You slapped his arm and tried to contain your laughter.\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t think we\u2019d make it back to the house anyway,\u201d you said, gazing up at him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAt least I got like two steps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, backward.\u201d</p><p>Chris chuckled as he leaned forward, attaching his lips to yours to distract you from what was happening below. He pushed himself in, and it burned, the stretch was painful and sending jolts of panic up your spine, but you were so lost in the kiss you didn\u2019t give into it. After a while it dissipated, and you wrapped your legs around his waist as he began to move in and out of you, his lips then attaching themselves to the sensitive area of skin just below your ear. You tried to move along with him, but he wouldn\u2019t let you move ahead of the pace he had set. It was slow, almost like the kiss had been in the bathroom, or the way that the two of you had seemed to get to this weird place in your \u2018relationship.\u2019</p><p>Chris gave a particularly loud grunt as he seemed to slip, his knee colliding with the side of the table and sending a vibration through the two of you. You giggled against his mouth, vividly feeling your vagina clench and relax as the laughter rippled out of you. Chris chuckled against your ear, his breath tickling your skin as the two of you couldn\u2019t seem to stop. You were slightly aware of the fact that Chris had stopped moving, and you tilted your head to look up at him.\u00a0\u201cYou close?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and you could see the sweat against his forehead as he tried to contain himself.\u00a0\u201cThen,\u201d you murmured, guiding his finger to your aching clit.\u00a0\u201cTake me with you.\u201d</p><p>That line seemed to catch his attention, and he pressed his finger against you, the pleasure pushing you closer and closer to where he was. He started to move again, the burning stretch mixed with the absolutely sinful amount of pleasure you were getting brought you to his level, and with one final stroke of him inside you, you reached your climax. Eyes screwing shut and head falling back as he finished as well, the warmness of his release relaxing your aching sex as he pulled out and leaned over you.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he sighed, leaning his head against your heaving chest.\u00a0\u201cThat was undeniably the best sex I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d<br></p><p>You ran a finger through his hair, the strands wet with sweat.\u00a0\u201cI could say the same to you, Mr Evans.\u201d</p><p>The weak chuckle you received in response had you in fits of laughter.</p><p>~<br><br></p><p>TIME SKIP TO A YEAR LATER</p><p>It was the premiere of your new film.

And the two of you certainly never spoke about the heated kiss in the bathroom, that Cillian had so rudely interrupted before things got too steamy. You had been snarky at him when he drove you home. He caught on in the end, but refused to even let you explain, saying that you were\u00a0\u2018like a daughter to him,\u2019 and that he\u00a0\u2018didn\u2019t need to know everything that was happening.\u2019 You had talked to Yvonne about it, and she had been giddy with excitement, but swore herself to secrecy.</p><p>Keanu had also taken up the job onset, he was one of the lead actors in the film and Cillian and yourself were opposite him. The three of you worked well off of each other, and due to Keanu\u2019s and Chris\u2019 star power, word got around quick that the two of them were doing another movie together. You and Cillian sat back and watched the twitter world explode with a countless number of tweets from excited fans from both their sides of the twitter-verse. You had sworn to yourself to be like Cillian and refuse any form of social media, and you were pretty proud of yourself for making it this far.</p><p>There was one day on set in particular that you remembered vividly in your mind like nothing else. Chris and Cillian were giving each other notes and tips from the last scene that Cillian had filmed, while you and Keanu snuck back into the trailer for lunch and a quick conversation before the two of you were needed again. Keanu had been very upfront.\u00a0\u201cSo how long have you had a thing for Chris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that good of an actor huh?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t dance around the question.\u201d<br></p><p>You had told him everything, from the moment the two of you met, to the moments leading up to the cafe conversation, but you skipped over the bathroom scene. He got the picture nonetheless.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s a very long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d<br></p><p>And, as the great Keanu Reeves leaned back in his chair and watched Chris Evans approach the trailer to get the two of you ready, he whispered,\u00a0\u201cyou two would be cute together.\u201d</p><p>Finally, filming came to a close and all the actors were given the day off of set. Chris had to stay and look over some things, and because you felt like you owed him for getting him to take up the mantle as the director, you headed downtown to get him a cup of coffee before returning to set. He was in his and Cillian\u2019s trailer by the time you showed up, and Cillian had gone home for his son\u2019s birthday, so there was no chance he could walk in again, so you decided it was now or never.</p><p>You knocked on the door, heart leaping into your throat as you held onto the coffees in your hands in a tight grip. When he answered, he had a towel draped loosely over his hips and a smile curved onto his face. He seemed genuinely happy to see you, those blue eyes alive with excitement.\u00a0\u201cYou brought me coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d you replied, taking the steps up towards him.\u00a0\u201cThought it was my ticket in to talk to you.\u201d<br></p><p>He nodded, stepping aside so you could walk in and take a seat at the table. Chris looked conflicted, like he didn\u2019t know whether or not to get himself dressed, or stay in the towel. Ultimately, he sat down across from you, those eyes never leaving yours even when he brought the coffee to his lips.\u00a0\u201cWhat did you want to talk about, Miss y/n?\u201d</p><p>You shrugged.\u00a0\u201cAnything and everything,\u201d you teased, running your finger over the brim of the cup.\u00a0\u201cAnd about the kiss.\u201d</p><p>He tensed up.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry for that,\u201d he said, his tone was hard to define.\u00a0\u201cI should\u2019ve given you space. You had just broken up with your boyfriend and it wasn\u2019t right of me to come onto you like that. Especially because your so young-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t step away,\u201d was all you said, setting your coffee down on the table so you could stand in front of him.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve wanted you from the moment we met, but I know that <i>that </i>was definitely not the right time for either of us.\u201d<br></p><p>Chris looked up at you, his hands reaching up and rubbing soothing circles against your waist. His thumbs pushed the hem of you shirt up slightly, and he leaned forward, his lips attaching themselves to the skin of you stomach and sucking and biting on it until he knew a hickey would appear. You could barely contain yourself, the feeling alone making you weak at the knees and almost making them buckle underneath your weight.</p><p>He moved away.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re not too fussed about the age difference?\u201d He asked, his lips red and swollen. When you shook your head you sat down on his lap, your jeans doing nothing to conceal the feeling of him beneath you. You knew that there was sexual tension between the two of you, but you didn\u2019t know there was this much, and as you felt him grind against you with everything he had your mind almost blanked.\u00a0\u201cMaybe we should take this home?\u201d</p><p>You pressed a heated kiss to his neck, but could resist yourself at getting at least one of you off before the two of you got back to his house. You moved the towel away, and grabbed onto him in a loose but firm grip, making him buck against you hand in a way you hadn\u2019t seen before, as though he was letting himself get lost in the feeling. His head fell back, his mouth parting open as you moved your hand up and down, not sure when to stop. Tom had never enjoyed getting a handjob, he thought it was too childish, but the way that Chris moved under your touch, his muscles rippling as pleasure overtook him completely had your own body alive with ecstasy.</p><p>Finally, his head shot back up, one of his hands going to the back of you head and pushing you forward into a sloppy kiss, and the other covered yours around his dick, helping you get to a pace that was going to get him high quicker, and it did. He moaned into your mouth, but his hand never stopped moving as his muscles tightened and he came, hard and heavy. His chest heaving. He broke away from you, those eyes still dark with lust.</p><p>He fixed the towel around his waist and lifted you up onto the table in front of him. His dizziness from his orgasm almost making him topple backwards as he got your jeans undone and began to pull them down your legs. You kept your gaze on him, not sure where else to look as he pressed a kiss to your inner thigh and moved your underwear out of the way as his fingers traced up and down between your shaking legs. He pushed two of them in without a moments hesitation, your eyes screwing shut at the feeling, as he dragged them slowly in and out, the pads of his fingertips grazing the inside of your vagina as he moved.</p><p>You were squirming underneath him, barely able to breathe, but as he added a third finger and brushed his thumb against your clit, that was when he through you closer to the edge. You moaned loud and without any embarrassment, arching up into his touch to connect you lips, but he just pushed you back down as his face joined his fingers between your legs.\u00a0\u201cChris!\u201d</p><p>The pleasure of his tongue against you was almost unbearable and when you finally hit the edge, you cried out, your orgasm rippling through you like you couldn\u2019t contain it. He coursed you through it, and as you came down from your high, his finger retracted, and his mouth attached to your neck to give you a quick kiss before he stood up.</p><p>He dropped the towel, and you felt a jolt of fear course through you without warning. He was bigger than Tom, way, <i>way </i>bigger than Tom. You had only become accustomed to Tom\u2019s size after a few instances of intimacy, but Chris was going to take a lot more than that. He seemed to notice you hesitation, and brought you in for a slow, but sensual kiss, it was slow, and it made you relax in his arms. Your heard him curse as he tried to adjust to get around the table, and you giggled breathlessly, only to hear him join in a few moments later.\u00a0</p><p>He looked around the room quickly, gazing at his discarded jeans and the wallet against the counter. He went to walk over, but you sat up.\u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t need protection,\u201d you assured him, watching his body relax.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m on the pill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFan-fucking-tastic.\u201d</p><p>You wasted no time and got your top half undressed, and Chris watched you in awe, as you discarded your shirt and bra on the ground beside you. He pulled your drenched underwear down your legs and positioned himself, not before bringing you into his arms so he could whisper something in your ear.\u00a0\u201cI love what you\u2019ve done with the place.\u201d</p><p>You slapped his arm and tried to contain your laughter.\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t think we\u2019d make it back to the house anyway,\u201d you said, gazing up at him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAt least I got like two steps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, backward.\u201d</p><p>Chris chuckled as he leaned forward, attaching his lips to yours to distract you from what was happening below. He pushed himself in, and it burned, the stretch was painful and sending jolts of panic up your spine, but you were so lost in the kiss you didn\u2019t give into it. After a while it dissipated, and you wrapped your legs around his waist as he began to move in and out of you, his lips then attaching themselves to the sensitive area of skin just below your ear. You tried to move along with him, but he wouldn\u2019t let you move ahead of the pace he had set. It was slow, almost like the kiss had been in the bathroom, or the way that the two of you had seemed to get to this weird place in your \u2018relationship.\u2019</p><p>Chris gave a particularly loud grunt as he seemed to slip, his knee colliding with the side of the table and sending a vibration through the two of you. You giggled against his mouth, vividly feeling your vagina clench and relax as the laughter rippled out of you. Chris chuckled against your ear, his breath tickling your skin as the two of you couldn\u2019t seem to stop. You were slightly aware of the fact that Chris had stopped moving, and you tilted your head to look up at him.\u00a0\u201cYou close?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and you could see the sweat against his forehead as he tried to contain himself.\u00a0\u201cThen,\u201d you murmured, guiding his finger to your aching clit.\u00a0\u201cTake me with you.\u201d</p><p>That line seemed to catch his attention, and he pressed his finger against you, the pleasure pushing you closer and closer to where he was. He started to move again, the burning stretch mixed with the absolutely sinful amount of pleasure you were getting brought you to his level, and with one final stroke of him inside you, you reached your climax. Eyes screwing shut and head falling back as he finished as well, the warmness of his release relaxing your aching sex as he pulled out and leaned over you.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he sighed, leaning his head against your heaving chest.\u00a0\u201cThat was undeniably the best sex I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d<br></p><p>You ran a finger through his hair, the strands wet with sweat.\u00a0\u201cI could say the same to you, Mr Evans.\u201d</p><p>The weak chuckle you received in response had you in fits of laughter.</p><p>~<br><br></p><p>TIME SKIP TO A YEAR LATER</p><p>It was the premiere of your new film. Keanu and Cillian had already made themselves known at the event, and were waiting for you and Chris to get your asses there. Answering press questions without the director or the lead actress was a lot harder than they had first expected. Keanu had willed Cillian to be patient, but the Irishman knew you too well, and had already began drinking to try and distract himself.</p><p>You and Chris were in the car to the event. You in a red dress that made you feel amazing, and Chris in a black suit and shirt, the only evidence of him being with you was the peak of a red handkerchief poking out of his pocket. Right now, the two of you were making out in the back of said car, his hands gripping your waist, and you trying to push him away. By the time you met up with Keanu and Cillian, the two of them were almost as exhausted as you two were.</p><p>After the premiere you headed back out for more questions, and you stood by Chris the whole time, as though the two of you were glued at the hip. If the press didn\u2019t get any sort of indication that you were together, they were stupid. As you headed over to Grae Drake, one of the interviewers from Rotten Tomatoes, you giggled in delight, enveloping her in a hug.\u00a0\u201cGrae!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d The redheaded woman said, and she watched Chris approach and wrap and arm around your waist.\u00a0\u201cOh my God! That film was amazing!\u201d</p><p>You thanked her.\u00a0\u201cSeriously,\u201d she said, leaning forward as though she was telling you a secret.\u00a0\u201cThere is talk that it\u2019s going to be up for a few awards when the next season comes around. Best Director! Best Actress!\u201d She pretended to faint.</p><p>You leaned over to Chris, excited at the idea.\u00a0\u201cNo more irrelevancy eh?\u201d You joked.</p><p>His tone was light.\u00a0\u201cIt was never about that,\u201d he chastised, pressing a kiss to your shoulder.\u00a0\u201cBut, Best Director does sound appealing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it would.\u201d</p><p>~</p><p><i>THAT\u2019S ALL FOLKS!</i></p><p><i>THANKS SO MUCH FOR READING BETTER SORRY THAN SAFE! IT WAS THE FIRST FANFICTION I HAVE EVER WRITTEN (AS WELL AS THE FIRST SMUT I\u2019VE EVER WRITTEN) BUT I ABSOLUTELY LOVED GETTING TO KNOW ALL THE READERS AND HEARING YOU GUYS\u2019 FEEDBACK ON MY WORK.

Especially because your so young-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t step away,&rdquo; was all you said, setting your coffee down on the table so you could stand in front of him.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted you from the moment we met, but I know that <i>that </i>was definitely not the right time for either of us.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Chris looked up at you, his hands reaching up and rubbing soothing circles against your waist. His thumbs pushed the hem of you shirt up slightly, and he leaned forward, his lips attaching themselves to the skin of you stomach and sucking and biting on it until he knew a hickey would appear. You could barely contain yourself, the feeling alone making you weak at the knees and almost making them buckle underneath your weight.</p><p>He moved away.&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not too fussed about the age difference?&rdquo; He asked, his lips red and swollen. When you shook your head you sat down on his lap, your jeans doing nothing to conceal the feeling of him beneath you. You knew that there was sexual tension between the two of you, but you didn&rsquo;t know there was this much, and as you felt him grind against you with everything he had your mind almost blanked.&nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe we should take this home?&rdquo;</p><p>You pressed a heated kiss to his neck, but could resist yourself at getting at least one of you off before the two of you got back to his house. You moved the towel away, and grabbed onto him in a loose but firm grip, making him buck against you hand in a way you hadn&rsquo;t seen before, as though he was letting himself get lost in the feeling. His head fell back, his mouth parting open as you moved your hand up and down, not sure when to stop. Tom had never enjoyed getting a handjob, he thought it was too childish, but the way that Chris moved under your touch, his muscles rippling as pleasure overtook him completely had your own body alive with ecstasy.</p><p>Finally, his head shot back up, one of his hands going to the back of you head and pushing you forward into a sloppy kiss, and the other covered yours around his dick, helping you get to a pace that was going to get him high quicker, and it did. He moaned into your mouth, but his hand never stopped moving as his muscles tightened and he came, hard and heavy. His chest heaving. He broke away from you, those eyes still dark with lust.</p><p>He fixed the towel around his waist and lifted you up onto the table in front of him. His dizziness from his orgasm almost making him topple backwards as he got your jeans undone and began to pull them down your legs. You kept your gaze on him, not sure where else to look as he pressed a kiss to your inner thigh and moved your underwear out of the way as his fingers traced up and down between your shaking legs. He pushed two of them in without a moments hesitation, your eyes screwing shut at the feeling, as he dragged them slowly in and out, the pads of his fingertips grazing the inside of your vagina as he moved.</p><p>You were squirming underneath him, barely able to breathe, but as he added a third finger and brushed his thumb against your clit, that was when he through you closer to the edge. You moaned loud and without any embarrassment, arching up into his touch to connect you lips, but he just pushed you back down as his face joined his fingers between your legs.&nbsp;&ldquo;Chris!&rdquo;</p><p>The pleasure of his tongue against you was almost unbearable and when you finally hit the edge, you cried out, your orgasm rippling through you like you couldn&rsquo;t contain it. He coursed you through it, and as you came down from your high, his finger retracted, and his mouth attached to your neck to give you a quick kiss before he stood up.</p><p>He dropped the towel, and you felt a jolt of fear course through you without warning. He was bigger than Tom, way, <i>way </i>bigger than Tom. You had only become accustomed to Tom&rsquo;s size after a few instances of intimacy, but Chris was going to take a lot more than that. He seemed to notice you hesitation, and brought you in for a slow, but sensual kiss, it was slow, and it made you relax in his arms. Your heard him curse as he tried to adjust to get around the table, and you giggled breathlessly, only to hear him join in a few moments later.&nbsp;</p><p>He looked around the room quickly, gazing at his discarded jeans and the wallet against the counter. He went to walk over, but you sat up.&nbsp;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need protection,&rdquo; you assured him, watching his body relax.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on the pill.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fan-fucking-tastic.&rdquo;</p><p>You wasted no time and got your top half undressed, and Chris watched you in awe, as you discarded your shirt and bra on the ground beside you. He pulled your drenched underwear down your legs and positioned himself, not before bringing you into his arms so he could whisper something in your ear.&nbsp;&ldquo;I love what you&rsquo;ve done with the place.&rdquo;</p><p>You slapped his arm and tried to contain your laughter.&nbsp;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d make it back to the house anyway,&rdquo; you said, gazing up at him.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;At least I got like two steps.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, backward.&rdquo;</p><p>Chris chuckled as he leaned forward, attaching his lips to yours to distract you from what was happening below. He pushed himself in, and it burned, the stretch was painful and sending jolts of panic up your spine, but you were so lost in the kiss you didn&rsquo;t give into it. After a while it dissipated, and you wrapped your legs around his waist as he began to move in and out of you, his lips then attaching themselves to the sensitive area of skin just below your ear. You tried to move along with him, but he wouldn&rsquo;t let you move ahead of the pace he had set. It was slow, almost like the kiss had been in the bathroom, or the way that the two of you had seemed to get to this weird place in your &lsquo;relationship.&rsquo;</p><p>Chris gave a particularly loud grunt as he seemed to slip, his knee colliding with the side of the table and sending a vibration through the two of you. You giggled against his mouth, vividly feeling your vagina clench and relax as the laughter rippled out of you. Chris chuckled against your ear, his breath tickling your skin as the two of you couldn&rsquo;t seem to stop. You were slightly aware of the fact that Chris had stopped moving, and you tilted your head to look up at him.&nbsp;&ldquo;You close?&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded, and you could see the sweat against his forehead as he tried to contain himself.&nbsp;&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; you murmured, guiding his finger to your aching clit.&nbsp;&ldquo;Take me with you.&rdquo;</p><p>That line seemed to catch his attention, and he pressed his finger against you, the pleasure pushing you closer and closer to where he was. He started to move again, the burning stretch mixed with the absolutely sinful amount of pleasure you were getting brought you to his level, and with one final stroke of him inside you, you reached your climax. Eyes screwing shut and head falling back as he finished as well, the warmness of his release relaxing your aching sex as he pulled out and leaned over you.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he sighed, leaning his head against your heaving chest.&nbsp;&ldquo;That was undeniably the best sex I&rsquo;ve ever had.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You ran a finger through his hair, the strands wet with sweat.&nbsp;&ldquo;I could say the same to you, Mr Evans.&rdquo;</p><p>The weak chuckle you received in response had you in fits of laughter.</p><p>~<br /><br /></p><p>TIME SKIP TO A YEAR LATER</p><p>It was the premiere of your new film. Keanu and Cillian had already made themselves known at the event, and were waiting for you and Chris to get your asses there. Answering press questions without the director or the lead actress was a lot harder than they had first expected. Keanu had willed Cillian to be patient, but the Irishman knew you too well, and had already began drinking to try and distract himself.</p><p>You and Chris were in the car to the event. You in a red dress that made you feel amazing, and Chris in a black suit and shirt, the only evidence of him being with you was the peak of a red handkerchief poking out of his pocket. Right now, the two of you were making out in the back of said car, his hands gripping your waist, and you trying to push him away. By the time you met up with Keanu and Cillian, the two of them were almost as exhausted as you two were.</p><p>After the premiere you headed back out for more questions, and you stood by Chris the whole time, as though the two of you were glued at the hip. If the press didn&rsquo;t get any sort of indication that you were together, they were stupid. As you headed over to Grae Drake, one of the interviewers from Rotten Tomatoes, you giggled in delight, enveloping her in a hug.&nbsp;&ldquo;Grae!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my God!&rdquo; The redheaded woman said, and she watched Chris approach and wrap and arm around your waist.&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh my God! That film was amazing!&rdquo;</p><p>You thanked her.&nbsp;&ldquo;Seriously,&rdquo; she said, leaning forward as though she was telling you a secret.&nbsp;&ldquo;There is talk that it&rsquo;s going to be up for a few awards when the next season comes around. Best Director! Best Actress!&rdquo; She pretended to faint.</p><p>You leaned over to Chris, excited at the idea.&nbsp;&ldquo;No more irrelevancy eh?&rdquo; You joked.</p><p>His tone was light.&nbsp;&ldquo;It was never about that,&rdquo; he chastised, pressing a kiss to your shoulder.&nbsp;&ldquo;But, Best Director does sound appealing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought it would.&rdquo;</p><p>~</p><p><i>THAT&rsquo;S ALL FOLKS!</i></p><p><i>THANKS SO MUCH FOR READING BETTER SORRY THAN SAFE! IT WAS THE FIRST FANFICTION I HAVE EVER WRITTEN (AS WELL AS THE FIRST SMUT I&rsquo;VE EVER WRITTEN) BUT I ABSOLUTELY LOVED GETTING TO KNOW ALL THE READERS AND HEARING YOU GUYS&rsquo; FEEDBACK ON MY WORK.
