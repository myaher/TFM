His skin started glowing due to the clash of the cold and the heat, but the tingle all over his body reminded him that he was still alive. </p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d Sansa kneeled down next to the tub.

Her blue eyes however were reflecting the glow of the burning fire in the hearth. \u201cI will wash away the blood and dirt, okay?\u201d</p><p>He wanted to shake his head. He wanted to nod.

The cuts seem superficial.\u201d She washed his abdomen and then the cloth went between his thighs.</p><p>His entire body responded. He felt a shiver of the pleasant kind rolling down his spine, his heart beat faster and faster in his aching chest and in the back of his mind a little voice screamed for more. But he wasn\u2019t capable of more right now. He wasn\u2019t even capable of talking and telling her what he really wanted and longed for.</p><p>Too quickly his entire body was cleaned and the moment was over.</p><p>Once more she wrapped an arm around his waist and helped him to stand up. She didn\u2019t complain that he was soaking her dress. She didn\u2019t say that he was heavy. She helped him stepping out of the cooling water and once he was seated on his wooden chair again she reached for a towel. With the same care and precision as she had washed him she now dried every inch of his skin. Carefully she dabbed the parts that were bruised or wounded, but even if she would have accidentally hurt him he wouldn\u2019t have had the energy to moan.</p><p>He was Jon Snow. He had gathered the biggest army ever seen to fight the biggest war ever fought. But here he was, naked in front of a princess, a queen, unable to even mutter a simple thank you. No one should have seen him like this, but he was glad that at least it was Sansa. He wouldn\u2019t have wanted it to be anyone else.</p><p>The wooden floor cracked under her bare feet when she walked to the closet to get him some clean underwear. And once more she kneeled down in front of him, this time to help him put it on. And again her arm slid around his waist to help him up, this time to lead him to his comfortable bed.</p><p>His muscles relaxed when his back touched the soft mattress and he almost drifted away immediately when she draped the warm blanket over him. </p><p>\u201cSleep well, Jon.\u201d Her soft lips kissed his forehead. \u201cYou fought well today.\u201d </p><p>He mustered the last bit of energy and willpower he had left in him. His fingers curled around her wrist and he pulled her back when she was about to walk away. \u201cStay\u2026\u201d His voice was hoarse and barely a whisper, but Sansa stood still. Normally he would have added a please, but this time he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>She freed her wrist from his strong embrace, but then she took off her underdress and she lifted the blanket up again. When her body touched his he couldn\u2019t fight his fatigue any longer, but Sansa draped his arm around her shoulders and curled up against his naked chest.</p><p>A smile spread across his face while he fell asleep. \u00a0</p>",

She didn\u2019t complain that he was soaking her dress. She didn\u2019t say that he was heavy. She helped him stepping out of the cooling water and once he was seated on his wooden chair again she reached for a towel.

His fingers curled around her wrist and he pulled her back when she was about to walk away. \u201cStay\u2026\u201d His voice was hoarse and barely a whisper, but Sansa stood still. Normally he would have added a please, but this time he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>She freed her wrist from his strong embrace, but then she took off her underdress and she lifted the blanket up again.

His tongue and lips refused to form words and his muscles refused to move. He couldn&rsquo;t keep her from taking off his coat and his armour. He couldn&rsquo;t keep her from taking off hiss boots and his pants. And he also couldn&rsquo;t keep her from taking off his breeches. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; She wrapped an arm around his naked waist and helped him to get up from his chair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you.&rdquo; She lead him to a wooden bathtub and without really thinking about it he stepped in. </p><p>The water was pleasantly warm, just like the rest of the room, and he allowed himself to sink into it until it reached his chin. His skin started glowing due to the clash of the cold and the heat, but the tingle all over his body reminded him that he was still alive. </p><p>&ldquo;Jon?&rdquo; Sansa kneeled down next to the tub. Her usually neat hairdo was now a mess and she had stripped down to her underdress. Her blue eyes however were reflecting the glow of the burning fire in the hearth. &ldquo;I will wash away the blood and dirt, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>He wanted to shake his head. He wanted to nod. He wanted to tell her that he could wash himself, but he knew he couldn&rsquo;t. Instead he simply closed his eyes when she pressed the warm cloth to his cheek. </p><p>Her touch was soft and firm at once. First she washed his face. Then she cleaned his shoulders and chest. She moved on to his legs and feet and a soft chuckle escaped when she pressed the tip of the cloth between his toes. </p><p>He had never known a touch could be this pleasant.</p><p>&ldquo;The Maester will have to check your wounds tomorrow.
