        "body": "<p>This isn\u2019t my work. I\u2019m just the editor and the publisher. This is actually written by my husband, and I\u2019ve been nagging him to get it out there, so he\u2019s finally agreed to let it loose. Please enjoy.</p><p><br/></p><p>The wind howled along the dark, dank sewer, it was a noise he\u2019d heard many times before, so he wasn\u2019t frightened of it. Carl had worked these tunnels for 20 years, and in that time he\u2019d seen and heard everything they could do to try and spook the guys who cleared these waterways.</p><p>It was a hard job. Underpaid and dangerous at times, most guys worked alone, tramping along until they found the blocked area and cleared it by hand. No one on the surface appreciated the work they did, no one cared as long as the toilets flushed and the showers drained away then they never gave a thought to what happened next. Never appreciating that things didn\u2019t just vanish when it left their homes.</p><p>Carl carried on walking through the gloom, he had a small headlamp attached to his hard hat, but it was barely throwing any light out and certainly nothing that was very effective against this blackness. \u201cDamn thing,\u201d he thought angrily tapping the bulb on his head, trying to adjust the settings to give more light as he walked along. \u00a0A few more taps and he got it going as a sudden bright light flooded from the lamp and showed the concrete path in front of him.</p><p>He sighed heavily. \u2018Just four more years, you\u2019ve managed this long,\u2019 he thought. </p><p>Then he could retire and leave this stinking rat hole behind him. Carrying on down the path, he came upon the blockage and quickly bent over to clear it. The light on his head flickered again as he worked, he let out a low growl and reached for his radio.</p><p>\u201cCarl to control over,\u201d he said his voice echoing over the rounded walls of the sewer.</p><p>\u201cControl here what\u2019s up mate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve found the blockage, but my damn headlight keeps flickering can\u2019t see a thing down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, we\u2019ve had a few guys report the same thing. When you get back bring it in, and I\u2019ll swap it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, I\u2019ve got it clear I\u2019m heading back now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries see you soon over.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>Carl clipped the radio back onto his belt- even though it had only been a couple of minutes his back ached from bending over. He began to walk again when he thought he heard a sound up ahead, it was a low whirring mechanical noise that strangely hardly made an echo.</p><p>\u201cAnyone there?\u201d Carl asked. The sound stopped.</p><p>He paused. Had he imagined it? Was it more of the strange howls from the wind?</p><p>\u2018No, the wind doesn\u2019t sound that way,\u2019 he thought. He was too experienced to make that mistake. </p><p>He took a few more steps, and the noise started again, but louder, it seemed to be coming closer.</p><p>\u201cWho is there?\u201d Carl shouted angrily. As he did so the light on his hard hat flickered and went out completely. He growled and took off the hat to fiddle with the lamp.</p><p>The noise came closer then stopped what felt like only metres in front of him.</p><p>\u201cWho is there?\u201d a voice repeated Carl&rsquo;s words back to him. </p><p>The words came through the blackness. It was a cold, mechanical and unfeeling sound and It sent shivers down Carl&rsquo;s spine. He put his hat back on the light still not working as he looked up towards where he thought the voice came from.</p><p>\u201cWho is there?\u201d the voice repeated louder this time, Carl could see 2 small lights flashing in rhythm to the voice at about head height.</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Carl, I\u2019m a sewer worker here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarl?\u201d The voice and the lights came again.</p><p>\u201cCARL?\u201d it repeated angrier this time.</p><p>\u201cTha\u2026That&rsquo;s right,\u201d Carl stammered, increasingly frightened of this unseen presence in front of him.</p><p>\u201cWHERE IS THE DOCTOR?\u201d The voice shouted, beginning to sound like it was reaching the extent of its capabilities. </p><p>\u201cDoc..Doctor?\u201d Carl was confused and desperate to get away as he started to edge backwards. \u201cWhat doctor?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWHERE IS THE DOCTOR?\u201d The voice repeated closer than ever now. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about!\u201d Carl cried out terrified now of what was happening he kept trying to make out the shape of the thing in front of him when the lights flashed, but he couldn\u2019t recognise the form through the darkness. </p><p>The whirring stopped the pause suddenly seemed endless until finally, he heard the voice again. </p><p>\u201cTHEN YOU ARE IRRELEVANT AND WILL BE EXTERMINATED.\u201d</p><p>Carl\u2019s breathing was hitched in his throat. The panic was clouding his mind as he didn\u2019t know what to do at that moment. </p><p>The laser blast came out the blackness crashing into Carl&rsquo;s chest and sending him sprawling against the sewer wall. He was dead before he hit the ground.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cSeeya later!\u201d</p><p>Bobbie waved to her friends as they left the office and went their separate ways home. </p><p>It was Friday night, and she was feeling happy. No work for two days, the sun was shining, and she had a big date tonight with a gorgeous guy she had met at the local coffee bar a couple of days ago.</p><p>She smiled as she remembered the incident, he had bumped into her in the queue and spilt coffee all down himself -luckily it was iced otherwise a trip to casualty may have been needed. He had looked at her, his face flushing red with embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cS&hellip;Sorry,\u201d he had stammered frantically dabbing his wet shirt and jeans with a napkin that she had grabbed off the counter. </p><p>\u201cNo worries,\u201d she had said handing him some more napkins, he took them eagerly and smiled at her. \u201cI\u2019m Bobbie,\u201d she had said out of nowhere. It wasn\u2019t in her character to flirt - she was shy and always in the background, so she was surprised the words had come out.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he laughed \u201cThat\u2019s my name too, well Robert but you know nicknames and all that,\u201d He paused \u201cDo you wanna grab a table?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Bobbie had smiled, again with internal surprise she hadn\u2019t just got flustered and left the shop.</p><p>They had sat down at the table and, after a few awkward seconds when Bobbie thought she had done the wrong thing, they began to talk. They talked and talked and talked. Before they knew where they were 45 mins had passed, and Bobbie was late for her return to work.</p><p>\u201cI gotta go I\u2019m late, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she stood up with a rushed smile, but Robert grabbed her hand and pressed a folded napkin into it.</p><p>\u201cCall me,\u201d he had said before standing and walking off, glancing back several times to look at her and make sure she was looking at the napkin \u2013 she was already putting his number into her phone.</p><p>Bobbie shook the daydream from her mind, still smiling and carried on walking down the street. It wasn\u2019t far to her apartment 20 mins or so, less if she cut through the underpass. She paused should she take the shortcut? She usually avoided it like the plague the place was usually full of teenagers, or drunks, or both and it was uncomfortable to walk past with them whistling and shouting at her.</p><p>She carried on her regular route then paused again, \u2018It would save a good 10 minutes,\u2019 she thought.</p><p>She checked her watch. \u201cEvery second counts when you\u2019re getting ready for such a hot guy,\u201d she chuckled to herself and turned back, taking a left turn she entered the underpass.</p><p>Bobbie\u2019s heels clacked on the hard concrete floor of the tunnel, the sound echoing around the curved walls of the underpass as cars thundered down the road above her head. The tunnel was long and narrow with electric lights placed every so often along the lengths of the roof. The lights buzzed like flies, and the whole atmosphere was oppressive. Several dark alcoves were built into the walls to allow access to pipes and cables although they were used more often by the kids who hung around in here to hide in and jump out at people.</p><p>She shivered.</p><p>She did not like this place, it always seemed damp, and as she read the graffiti on the walls, it conjured up disturbing images in her mind.</p><p>She shook her head, pulling her coat tighter around her. \u2018Pull yourself together,\u2019 Bobbie was scolding herself as she picked the pace up slightly. </p><p>She carried on for a few paces, then a thought struck her, and she paused to glance around and confirmed her theory. There was no one about as she looked ahead and back at the empty space. There should have always been numerous people here regardless of the time of day or night, be it just some youths kicking an empty bottle about, or homeless people trying to shelter from the extremes of weather and beg at the passers-by.</p><p>Not today. No one at all.</p><p>She continued to walk, quickening her pace without running outright, trying to think of the hot date she had that evening and not the unnerving tunnel she was in. When suddenly a voice rang out behind her echoing loudly. </p><p>\u201cHALT.\u201d</p><p>The voice was cold and metallic. Bobbie spun around and saw a large shape heading towards her. It almost like an upside down cone with lights on the top, a plunger sticking out the middle on the left side and some kind of tube sticking out on the right.</p><p>Bobbie paused and then laughed.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said \u201cYou got me,\u201d she had remembered there was a large sci-fi convention in town. Indeed she had passed a load of Stormtroopers on her way to way to work that morning. \u201cThat\u2019s a great costume!\u201d she smiled \u201cI hope you win a prize,\u201d She waved and turned around to continue walking when the voice came again.</p><p>\u201cWHERE IS THE DOCTOR?\u201d</p><p>It was menacing and sent shivers through Bobbie. She ignored the question and continued to walk, she was nearing the end now, and the sunlit exit to the tunnel was a welcoming sight. </p><p>\u201cWHERE IS THE DOCTOR?\u201d</p><p>Bobbie paused and turned around angrily. \u201cLook I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about and I don\u2019t want to know, it\u2019s a great costume, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re in the middle of some big roleplay adventure, but I don\u2019t want any part of it OK?\u201d</p><p>The tube sticking out its right side raised slightly.</p><p>\u201cTHEN YOU ARE IRRELEVANT AND WILL BE EXTERMINATED.\u201d</p><p>Bobbie started to back up but stumbled and fell to the ground.</p><p>That stumble saved her life as the laser bolt flew past her head only inches away from her skin. It crashed into the tunnel causing a cloud of dust to burst from the wall. Under cover of the thick dust, Bobbie got to her feet and ran the rest of the way through the tunnel and out into the sunshine, without stopping she flew up the hill and away.</p>",

He began to walk again when he thought he heard a sound up ahead, it was a low whirring mechanical noise that strangely hardly made an echo.</p><p>\u201cAnyone there?\u201d Carl asked. The sound stopped.</p><p>He paused. Had he imagined it? Was it more of the strange howls from the wind?</p><p>\u2018No, the wind doesn\u2019t sound that way,\u2019 he thought. He was too experienced to make that mistake. </p><p>He took a few more steps, and the noise started again, but louder, it seemed to be coming closer.</p><p>\u201cWho is there?\u201d Carl shouted angrily. As he did so the light on his hard hat flickered and went out completely. He growled and took off the hat to fiddle with the lamp.</p><p>The noise came closer then stopped what felt like only metres in front of him.</p><p>\u201cWho is there?\u201d a voice repeated Carl\u2019s words back to him. </p><p>The words came through the blackness. It was a cold, mechanical and unfeeling sound and It sent shivers down Carl\u2019s spine. He put his hat back on the light still not working as he looked up towards where he thought the voice came from.</p><p>\u201cWho is there?\u201d the voice repeated louder this time, Carl could see 2 small lights flashing in rhythm to the voice at about head height.</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Carl, I\u2019m a sewer worker here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarl?\u201d The voice and the lights came again.</p><p>\u201cCARL?\u201d it repeated angrier this time.</p><p>\u201cTha\u2026That\u2019s right,\u201d Carl stammered, increasingly frightened of this unseen presence in front of him.</p><p>\u201cWHERE IS THE DOCTOR?\u201d The voice shouted, beginning to sound like it was reaching the extent of its capabilities. </p><p>\u201cDoc..Doctor?\u201d Carl was confused and desperate to get away as he started to edge backwards. \u201cWhat doctor?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWHERE IS THE DOCTOR?\u201d The voice repeated closer than ever now. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about!\u201d Carl cried out terrified now of what was happening he kept trying to make out the shape of the thing in front of him when the lights flashed, but he couldn\u2019t recognise the form through the darkness. </p><p>The whirring stopped the pause suddenly seemed endless until finally, he heard the voice again. </p><p>\u201cTHEN YOU ARE IRRELEVANT AND WILL BE EXTERMINATED.\u201d</p><p>Carl\u2019s breathing was hitched in his throat. The panic was clouding his mind as he didn\u2019t know what to do at that moment. </p><p>The laser blast came out the blackness crashing into Carl\u2019s chest and sending him sprawling against the sewer wall. He was dead before he hit the ground.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cSeeya later!\u201d</p><p>Bobbie waved to her friends as they left the office and went their separate ways home. </p><p>It was Friday night, and she was feeling happy.

He put his hat back on the light still not working as he looked up towards where he thought the voice came from.</p><p>\u201cWho is there?\u201d the voice repeated louder this time, Carl could see 2 small lights flashing in rhythm to the voice at about head height.</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Carl, I\u2019m a sewer worker here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarl?\u201d The voice and the lights came again.</p><p>\u201cCARL?\u201d it repeated angrier this time.</p><p>\u201cTha\u2026That\u2019s right,\u201d Carl stammered, increasingly frightened of this unseen presence in front of him.</p><p>\u201cWHERE IS THE DOCTOR?\u201d The voice shouted, beginning to sound like it was reaching the extent of its capabilities. </p><p>\u201cDoc..Doctor?\u201d Carl was confused and desperate to get away as he started to edge backwards. \u201cWhat doctor?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWHERE IS THE DOCTOR?\u201d The voice repeated closer than ever now. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about!\u201d Carl cried out terrified now of what was happening he kept trying to make out the shape of the thing in front of him when the lights flashed, but he couldn\u2019t recognise the form through the darkness. </p><p>The whirring stopped the pause suddenly seemed endless until finally, he heard the voice again. </p><p>\u201cTHEN YOU ARE IRRELEVANT AND WILL BE EXTERMINATED.\u201d</p><p>Carl\u2019s breathing was hitched in his throat. The panic was clouding his mind as he didn\u2019t know what to do at that moment. </p><p>The laser blast came out the blackness crashing into Carl\u2019s chest and sending him sprawling against the sewer wall. He was dead before he hit the ground.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cSeeya later!\u201d</p><p>Bobbie waved to her friends as they left the office and went their separate ways home. </p><p>It was Friday night, and she was feeling happy. No work for two days, the sun was shining, and she had a big date tonight with a gorgeous guy she had met at the local coffee bar a couple of days ago.</p><p>She smiled as she remembered the incident, he had bumped into her in the queue and spilt coffee all down himself -luckily it was iced otherwise a trip to casualty may have been needed. He had looked at her, his face flushing red with embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cS\u2026Sorry,\u201d he had stammered frantically dabbing his wet shirt and jeans with a napkin that she had grabbed off the counter. </p><p>\u201cNo worries,\u201d she had said handing him some more napkins, he took them eagerly and smiled at her. \u201cI\u2019m Bobbie,\u201d she had said out of nowhere. It wasn\u2019t in her character to flirt - she was shy and always in the background, so she was surprised the words had come out.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he laughed \u201cThat\u2019s my name too, well Robert but you know nicknames and all that,\u201d He paused \u201cDo you wanna grab a table?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Bobbie had smiled, again with internal surprise she hadn\u2019t just got flustered and left the shop.</p><p>They had sat down at the table and, after a few awkward seconds when Bobbie thought she had done the wrong thing, they began to talk. They talked and talked and talked. Before they knew where they were 45 mins had passed, and Bobbie was late for her return to work.</p><p>\u201cI gotta go I\u2019m late, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she stood up with a rushed smile, but Robert grabbed her hand and pressed a folded napkin into it.</p><p>\u201cCall me,\u201d he had said before standing and walking off, glancing back several times to look at her and make sure she was looking at the napkin \u2013 she was already putting his number into her phone.</p><p>Bobbie shook the daydream from her mind, still smiling and carried on walking down the street. It wasn\u2019t far to her apartment 20 mins or so, less if she cut through the underpass. She paused should she take the shortcut? She usually avoided it like the plague the place was usually full of teenagers, or drunks, or both and it was uncomfortable to walk past with them whistling and shouting at her.</p><p>She carried on her regular route then paused again, \u2018It would save a good 10 minutes,\u2019 she thought.</p><p>She checked her watch. \u201cEvery second counts when you\u2019re getting ready for such a hot guy,\u201d she chuckled to herself and turned back, taking a left turn she entered the underpass.</p><p>Bobbie\u2019s heels clacked on the hard concrete floor of the tunnel, the sound echoing around the curved walls of the underpass as cars thundered down the road above her head. The tunnel was long and narrow with electric lights placed every so often along the lengths of the roof. The lights buzzed like flies, and the whole atmosphere was oppressive. Several dark alcoves were built into the walls to allow access to pipes and cables although they were used more often by the kids who hung around in here to hide in and jump out at people.</p><p>She shivered.</p><p>She did not like this place, it always seemed damp, and as she read the graffiti on the walls, it conjured up disturbing images in her mind.</p><p>She shook her head, pulling her coat tighter around her. \u2018Pull yourself together,\u2019 Bobbie was scolding herself as she picked the pace up slightly. </p><p>She carried on for a few paces, then a thought struck her, and she paused to glance around and confirmed her theory. There was no one about as she looked ahead and back at the empty space. There should have always been numerous people here regardless of the time of day or night, be it just some youths kicking an empty bottle about, or homeless people trying to shelter from the extremes of weather and beg at the passers-by.</p><p>Not today. No one at all.</p><p>She continued to walk, quickening her pace without running outright, trying to think of the hot date she had that evening and not the unnerving tunnel she was in. When suddenly a voice rang out behind her echoing loudly. </p><p>\u201cHALT.\u201d</p><p>The voice was cold and metallic. Bobbie spun around and saw a large shape heading towards her. It almost like an upside down cone with lights on the top, a plunger sticking out the middle on the left side and some kind of tube sticking out on the right.</p><p>Bobbie paused and then laughed.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said \u201cYou got me,\u201d she had remembered there was a large sci-fi convention in town. Indeed she had passed a load of Stormtroopers on her way to way to work that morning. \u201cThat\u2019s a great costume!\u201d she smiled \u201cI hope you win a prize,\u201d She waved and turned around to continue walking when the voice came again.</p><p>\u201cWHERE IS THE DOCTOR?\u201d</p><p>It was menacing and sent shivers through Bobbie. She ignored the question and continued to walk, she was nearing the end now, and the sunlit exit to the tunnel was a welcoming sight. </p><p>\u201cWHERE IS THE DOCTOR?\u201d</p><p>Bobbie paused and turned around angrily. \u201cLook I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about and I don\u2019t want to know, it\u2019s a great costume, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re in the middle of some big roleplay adventure, but I don\u2019t want any part of it OK?\u201d</p><p>The tube sticking out its right side raised slightly.</p><p>\u201cTHEN YOU ARE IRRELEVANT AND WILL BE EXTERMINATED.\u201d</p><p>Bobbie started to back up but stumbled and fell to the ground.</p><p>That stumble saved her life as the laser bolt flew past her head only inches away from her skin. It crashed into the tunnel causing a cloud of dust to burst from the wall. Under cover of the thick dust, Bobbie got to her feet and ran the rest of the way through the tunnel and out into the sunshine, without stopping she flew up the hill and away.</p>",
