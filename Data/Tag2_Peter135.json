I\u2019ve been told it should be fine, it won\u2019t be as bad as it\u2019s made out to be, but he\u2019s still family nonetheless.\u00a0</p><p>Sighing I shrug my bag onto my shoulder and head out of the classroom.\u00a0\u201cY/n?\u201d Hearing my name being called I turn around, forcing a small smile as Peter runs towards me.\u00a0\u201cI thought it was you.\u201d He smiles gently as he begins to walk alongside me.\u00a0\u201cMJ told me about your Dad, I\u2019m, I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d He speaks softly, not forcing the same sentence I\u2019ve heard fifty times in the past few days from strangers.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThanks, Peter.\u201d I glance up and his eyes are already on mine. His smile is gentle, warm, unlike my cold gaze that refuses to thaw.\u00a0\u201cI should get going if I want to make it in time for visiting hours.\u201d Glancing down at my watch I force myself to pick up the pace, leaving Peter behind before he can say anything else.\u00a0<br/></p><p>*</p><!-- more --><p>Sitting in the corridor the smell of chemicals fills my nostrils, burning the hairs that coat them as Nurses walk by with straight faces, tiredness evident under their eyes.\u00a0</p><p>I glance behind me as the blinds remain closed, hiding him or protecting me. Which it could be I\u2019m unsure at this point, but I don\u2019t doubt it is to protect me from seeing the truth, the reality that this is.\u00a0</p><p>The door opens and I quickly rise to my feet, brushing my hands down as the Doctor stands before me with that same sympathetic smile. I nod, knowing exactly what it means by this point.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry Y/n.\u201d He says with a straight face as he holds his arm out for me to walk alongside him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs he at least getting better?\u201d I ask as I turn my head, looking back at the closed-off room I\u2019ve only entered once the entire time he\u2019s been here.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say.\u201d Doctor Simmons explains, the same response he is obliged to provide me with. It\u2019s not discouraging, it\u2019s not hopeful but it gives something that isn\u2019t impeding his inevitable death.\u00a0<br/></p><p>As we reach the end of his ward I thank him before wrapping my coat tighter around my body.\u00a0\u201cGo careful, Y/n.\u201d He calls out as I sanitise my hands as I leave the building, not realising how bitter it actually would be this late.\u00a0</p><p>Wandering the streets, only a few blocks away from my house there is a section that I would usually avoid by all means. However, with unexpected flooding in my normal route home, I\u2019m left with no choice.\u00a0</p><p>I keep my head down, refusing to nudge my eyes any higher than within line of my boots.\u00a0Around me, I can hear voices rising, near me. But I try to walk a bit faster, shut them all out in the hope I\u2019m merely imagining it.\u00a0</p><p>And then I see myself flying towards the gravel.\u00a0</p><p>Lifting my head I grunt as I can feel pieces of gravel having scraped my cheek. I glance up to see three figures laughing down at me.\u00a0\u201cLook, she\u2019s a baby!\u201d One yells and the others begin to laugh more manically now.\u00a0</p><p>I try with all my might to rise to my feet, but one of them places their foot forcefully on my chest, trapping me under his weight.\u00a0\u201cCome on, baby. Fight.\u201d Another spits the words out and I struggle, hitting his leg with my fists but it\u2019s no use.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey guys, I mean this is hardly fair you know?\u201d The man with his foot on my chest lifts it up as the three of them look at each other, unsure where the voice came from.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Quickly I scramble backwards, still shaken from the incident.\u00a0</p><p>In front of me, I see a blur of blue and red as the three men start to panic and move in different directions.\u00a0</p><p>The entire scene plays out in seconds. The first man has his legs tied together as he falls flat on his face, swearing loudly. The second is running away until a web covers his entire body and lifts him to hang from the lampost.\u00a0</p><p>And then I see the third running towards me, a flash of metal causing me to scream and shut my eyes. Yet, the pain doesn\u2019t strike, the cold blade never reaches me.\u00a0</p><p>Hesitantly opening one eye I see the man in front of me with wide eyes as his mouth and hands are covered in webs.

Which it could be I\u2019m unsure at this point, but I don\u2019t doubt it is to protect me from seeing the truth, the reality that this is.\u00a0</p><p>The door opens and I quickly rise to my feet, brushing my hands down as the Doctor stands before me with that same sympathetic smile. I nod, knowing exactly what it means by this point.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry Y/n.\u201d He says with a straight face as he holds his arm out for me to walk alongside him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs he at least getting better?\u201d I ask as I turn my head, looking back at the closed-off room I\u2019ve only entered once the entire time he\u2019s been here.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say.\u201d Doctor Simmons explains, the same response he is obliged to provide me with. It\u2019s not discouraging, it\u2019s not hopeful but it gives something that isn\u2019t impeding his inevitable death.\u00a0<br></p><p>As we reach the end of his ward I thank him before wrapping my coat tighter around my body.\u00a0\u201cGo careful, Y/n.\u201d He calls out as I sanitise my hands as I leave the building, not realising how bitter it actually would be this late.\u00a0</p><p>Wandering the streets, only a few blocks away from my house there is a section that I would usually avoid by all means. However, with unexpected flooding in my normal route home, I\u2019m left with no choice.\u00a0</p><p>I keep my head down, refusing to nudge my eyes any higher than within line of my boots.\u00a0Around me, I can hear voices rising, near me. But I try to walk a bit faster, shut them all out in the hope I\u2019m merely imagining it.\u00a0</p><p>And then I see myself flying towards the gravel.\u00a0</p><p>Lifting my head I grunt as I can feel pieces of gravel having scraped my cheek. I glance up to see three figures laughing down at me.\u00a0\u201cLook, she\u2019s a baby!\u201d One yells and the others begin to laugh more manically now.\u00a0</p><p>I try with all my might to rise to my feet, but one of them places their foot forcefully on my chest, trapping me under his weight.\u00a0\u201cCome on, baby. Fight.\u201d Another spits the words out and I struggle, hitting his leg with my fists but it\u2019s no use.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey guys, I mean this is hardly fair you know?\u201d The man with his foot on my chest lifts it up as the three of them look at each other, unsure where the voice came from.\u00a0<br></p><p>Quickly I scramble backwards, still shaken from the incident.\u00a0</p><p>In front of me, I see a blur of blue and red as the three men start to panic and move in different directions.\u00a0</p><p>The entire scene plays out in seconds. The first man has his legs tied together as he falls flat on his face, swearing loudly. The second is running away until a web covers his entire body and lifts him to hang from the lampost.\u00a0</p><p>And then I see the third running towards me, a flash of metal causing me to scream and shut my eyes. Yet, the pain doesn\u2019t strike, the cold blade never reaches me.\u00a0</p><p>Hesitantly opening one eye I see the man in front of me with wide eyes as his mouth and hands are covered in webs. He looks up and I do too.\u00a0</p><p>As my head is tilted up I see the one person considered a local hero by some, and by others a vigilante.\u00a0\u201cI told you it wasn\u2019t fair. I mean, three against one.\u201d He lets out a laugh and I squint as I look at the masked figure, almost recognising his voice.\u00a0\u201cYou guys didn\u2019t stand a chance.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>A smile plays on my lips as he jumps down, landing a few feet away from me as he walks over to the man with the knife, taking it from his grasp.\u00a0\u201cNow, what\u2019d you think you\u2019d do with this?\u201d He plays with the weapon in his fingertips before throwing it in the air, causing the man to shut his eyes tightly.\u00a0</p><p>Spiderman shoots a web up as it lands by the man\u2019s feet, encapsulated in a web.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d think twice before contemplating attacking anyone again buddy.\u201d Spiderman slaps the man\u2019s cheek lightly before turning around and nearing me.\u00a0</p><p>He kneels down in front of me as I stare into his mask knowing tears are streaming down my cheeks.\u00a0\u201cHey, can I help you up?\u201d His voice is soft and I nod as he takes my hands in his, slowly lifting me up as I shake.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan you get me out of here?\u201d My words are weak, broken as I look up at the mask, wishing the person beneath could give me a reassuring smile.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOf course, just, just hold on tight, yeah?\u201d He squeaks out his words, making me laugh lightly.\u00a0\u201cYou have a beautiful laugh.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Without responding I hold on tightly to him as he lifts his arm, shooting a web until I feel weightless leaving the scene I was in behind.\u00a0</p><p>Closing my eyes I can feel the wind in my hair, the breeze spiralling through as I let out a laugh, exhilaration playing through my body.\u00a0\u201cOh my god.\u201d I yell as I hear Spiderman laugh as he nears a building, aiming towards it until we come to a gentle landing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou can erm, you can let go.\u201d He says softly as I open my eyes, seeing I\u2019m still holding onto him as if my life depends on it.\u00a0<br></p><p>I remove my arms from him as I move away and see the lights of the city below us in the corner of my eye.\u00a0\u201cOh wow.\u201d I mumble as I feel him move towards me, standing next to me as we stand silently, appreciating the view of the city never sleeps, never-ending for anyone.\u00a0\u201cI wanted to say thank you, for, for what you did back there.\u201d Lifting my head I brush my hair behind my ear, unsure how to talk to the masked figure considered a hero.\u00a0</p><p>He shrugs his shoulders.\u00a0\u201cIt was nothing, Y/n.

Oh man,\u201d He mutters to himself as I hear him incoherently phrasing things in hopes of one sounding sane enough.\u00a0\u201cThe thing is, I erm, we actually know each other.\u201d His voice softens to a familiar tone, one that is comforting but my mind refuses to tell me who it is.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou, you sound like someone. I just,\u201d Groaning loudly I rest my hands on my face and as I pull them away I see blood covering my cheek.\u00a0\u201coh crap.\u201d I mumble, unsure if the man behind the mask is panicking at this site like I am or remains unphased.\u00a0\u201cI know you can\u2019t take me to a hospital because you\u2019re Spiderman,\u201d Laughing to myself I realise how stupid that sentence sounds aloud.\u00a0\u201cbut is there somewhere I can get patched up? Can you, can you take me home?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOf course, Y/n.\u201d He replies before moving closer and this time I bury my head into his chest, ignoring the sound of the wind and focusing on his beating heart.\u00a0<br></p><p>*</p><p>It was almost as if he knew where to go, that my directions were almost unnecessary to the stranger.\u00a0</p><p>He lands on my balcony as I open the doors to my bedroom and fumble for my first aid kit.\u00a0\u201cDo you, do you need any help?\u201d He asks and I glance up, forgetting he was stood there.\u00a0</p><p>A small laugh escapes my lips as I shake my head.\u00a0\u201cI, I should be okay, but thank you Spiderman,\u201d I say quietly and as I glance down I notice a cut on his forearm, blood dripping through his suit.\u00a0\u201cyou\u2019re, you\u2019re bleeding,\u201d I motion down and he looks down, grabbing it tightly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJust a scratch.\u201d He mutters before turning around.\u00a0\u201cStay safe, Y/n.\u201d He says before disappearing back into the night, leaving me with the events of the past hour playing on repeat.\u00a0<br></p><p>*</p><p>Yawning loudly I can feel eyes on me as I walk, MJ doing her best to glare them down.\u00a0\u201cYou got into a fight?\u201d She asks, disbelief in her tone as I shake my head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hardly call it a fight.\u201d I say and I hear a small gasp as Ned stands in front of us both.<br></p><p>\u201cWow, first Peter and now you?\u201d He mutters and I look over to MJ, confusion on her face resembling mine.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat happened to Peter, Ned?\u201d I ask, trying to disguise the fear in my voice but I know they can still sense it.\u00a0<br></p><p>He shakes his head, letting out a deep sigh.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s got this big cut on his arm, says he slipped on a knife.\u201d MJ chuckles and Ned just looks at me with such focus.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWeird.\u201d MJ states and I nod in agreement.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Peter?\u201d I ask and Ned points to the Biology room with a small smile.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a bit.\u201d I mumble as I pass both of them in need of confirming the fact I already know to be true.\u00a0<br></p><p>Peter Parker saved my life, and he also happens to be Spiderman.\u00a0</p>",

Can you, can you take me home?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Of course, Y/n.&rdquo; He replies before moving closer and this time I bury my head into his chest, ignoring the sound of the wind and focusing on his beating heart.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>*</p><p>It was almost as if he knew where to go, that my directions were almost unnecessary to the stranger.&nbsp;</p><p>He lands on my balcony as I open the doors to my bedroom and fumble for my first aid kit.&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you, do you need any help?&rdquo; He asks and I glance up, forgetting he was stood there.&nbsp;</p><p>A small laugh escapes my lips as I shake my head.&nbsp;&ldquo;I, I should be okay, but thank you Spiderman,&rdquo; I say quietly and as I glance down I notice a cut on his forearm, blood dripping through his suit.&nbsp;&ldquo;you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re bleeding,&rdquo; I motion down and he looks down, grabbing it tightly.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Just a scratch.&rdquo; He mutters before turning around.&nbsp;&ldquo;Stay safe, Y/n.&rdquo; He says before disappearing back into the night, leaving me with the events of the past hour playing on repeat.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>*</p><p>Yawning loudly I can feel eyes on me as I walk, MJ doing her best to glare them down.&nbsp;&ldquo;You got into a fight?&rdquo; She asks, disbelief in her tone as I shake my head.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hardly call it a fight.&rdquo; I say and I hear a small gasp as Ned stands in front of us both.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wow, first Peter and now you?&rdquo; He mutters and I look over to MJ, confusion on her face resembling mine.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What happened to Peter, Ned?&rdquo; I ask, trying to disguise the fear in my voice but I know they can still sense it.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He shakes his head, letting out a deep sigh.&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got this big cut on his arm, says he slipped on a knife.&rdquo; MJ chuckles and Ned just looks at me with such focus.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Weird.&rdquo; MJ states and I nod in agreement.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Peter?&rdquo; I ask and Ned points to the Biology room with a small smile.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in a bit.&rdquo; I mumble as I pass both of them in need of confirming the fact I already know to be true.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Peter Parker saved my life, and he also happens to be Spiderman.&nbsp;</p>",

His smile is gentle, warm, unlike my cold gaze that refuses to thaw.&nbsp;&ldquo;I should get going if I want to make it in time for visiting hours.&rdquo; Glancing down at my watch I force myself to pick up the pace, leaving Peter behind before he can say anything else.&nbsp;<br /></p>\n<p>*</p>\n</p>",

Superheros, Powers, and other such phenomena are written in newspapers and displayed on big flashing billboards. You have 4 other sisters with you, all pissed at you for a mistake. If you can&rsquo;t help then you might find yourself alone. But what happens when you decide to do something stupid, and you&rsquo;re confronted by the Avengers? Could this be the help you so desperately needed? Or will it ultimately make things more complicated. </p><p>You&rsquo;re a sarcastic, emotionally distant, previously abused teenager of about 16 years(Really 346, but young for your species). You&rsquo;re sisters have similar past-abuse issues but widely different backgrounds. The reader in this replaces one of my Ocs in an RP I&rsquo;m doing with a friend. If you like comedy, angst, slowburn relationships, and don&rsquo;t mind OCs in the picture (I&rsquo;ve worked on them for 7 years guys), you may like this fic!<br /></p><p>Words: 5567, Chapters: 1/?, Language: English</p><ul><li>Fandoms: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe/works\">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/The%20Avengers%20(Marvel)%20-%20All%20Media%20Types/works\">The Avengers (Marvel) - All Media Types</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Spider-Man:%20Homecoming%20(2017)/works\">Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017)</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/The%20Avengers%20(Marvel%20Movies)/works\">The Avengers (Marvel Movies)</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Iron%20Man%20(Movies)/works\">Iron Man (Movies)</a></li><li>Rating: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Teen%20And%20Up%20Audiences/works\">Teen And Up Audiences</a></li><li>Warnings: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Graphic%20Depictions%20Of%20Violence/works\">Graphic Depictions Of Violence</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Rape*s*Non-Con/works\">Rape/Non-Con</a></li><li>Categories: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/F*s*M/works\">F/M</a></li><li>Characters: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Peter%20Parker/works\">Peter Parker</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Tony%20Stark/works\">Tony Stark</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Bruce%20Banner/works\">Bruce Banner</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Steve%20Rogers/works\">Steve Rogers</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Natasha%20Romanov%20(Marvel)/works\">Natasha Romanov (Marvel)</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Clint%20Barton/works\">Clint Barton</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Shuri%20Udaku/works\">Shuri Udaku</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Ned%20Leeds/works\">Ned Leeds</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Sam%20Wilson/works\">Sam Wilson</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Original%20Characters/works\">Original Characters</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Reader/works\">Reader</a></li><li>Relationships: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Peter%20Parker*s*Reader/works\">Peter Parker/Reader</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Peter%20Parker%20*a*%20Reader/works\">Peter Parker &amp;
