Next to him, Peter was wringing his hands, looking between Tony and the newly blank space. <br/><br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry Tony, I don&rsquo;t know what happened. One minute I was walking along with the artifact like I was supposed to, and then I tripped and it- okay there was a flash of purple light and it hit the tree and it vanished. And- and then I went and got you. It only took five minutes, tops, I swear I didn\u2019t do this earlier and just forgot to get you.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;You&hellip; tripped,&rdquo; Tony repeated doubtfully. Peter did have a nervous energy about him, but he was always graceful (in body at least). He ran into things sometimes when he and Tony were talking, but it was always preceded by senseless babbling about flowers and food and because he was backing away without looking where he was going. Tony did not believe that Peter just up and tripped while walking all by himself. <br/><br/>Peter nodded though, looking painfully earnest like Cap did when he first came out of the ice. <br/><br/>&ldquo;Peter, you don&rsquo;t trip.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;I do sometimes!&rdquo; he said defensively. <br/><br/>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re talking to someone maybe, not just while you&rsquo;re walking. Peter, it&rsquo;s okay if you messed up, we all fuck up sometimes. You want to tell me what really happened?&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;I did! I&rsquo;m not lying Tony, jesus christ.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Okay, so you were walking and tripped. What did you trip over?&rdquo; <br/><br/>He shifted uncomfortably. &ldquo;It might have been a rock, but it might also have been my own foot.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Tony frowned, concerned. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been out of it for a couple weeks, is everything alright?&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to ask me more about the missing tree?&rdquo; Peter asked, turning back to the spot with obviously fake interest. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite the conundrum, all the roots still look like they&rsquo;re in the ground, and the little plaque is still there, but the actual trunk and everything above it is missing. Strange indeed. And I did walk where it used to be to make sure it wasn&rsquo;t invisible or cloaked or something.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Good to know that it&rsquo;s missing and not hiding in plain sight,&rdquo; Tony agreed. &ldquo;What are you thinking about that&rsquo;s got you like this?&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not talk about it,&rdquo; Peter said quietly, not looking at him. <br/><br/>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to talk to me if you don&rsquo;t want to, but I think you need to talk to someone. It&rsquo;s been weeks, and nothing&rsquo;s changed with you. It hasn&rsquo;t affected your fighting yet, but I don&rsquo;t want to wait for that to happen for you to deal with this&ndash; whatever &lsquo;this&rsquo; might be.&quot;\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>&quot;It&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo; Peter ruffled his hair as his cheeks pinked. &ldquo;I like someone, and they don&rsquo;t feel the same.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;You sure about that? Cause no offense Peter, you&rsquo;re nothing to sniff at.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Why would I be offended by that?&rdquo; <br/><br/>Tony shrugged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m older than you, you might think it was weird. My point is, you&rsquo;re not acting like someone who&rsquo;s been turned down, you&rsquo;re acting like someone who&rsquo;s pining and also doesn&rsquo;t know that they&rsquo;re a catch. You&rsquo;re Spiderman! Come on, who wouldn&rsquo;t want to date you?&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;I can think of a few people.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Villains don&rsquo;t count.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Peter snorted. &ldquo;Yeah, I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about villains. Quite the opposite.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Have other heroes been talking shit? Tell me who, I&rsquo;ll kick their ass.&rdquo; When Peter started laughing, Tony added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious. Give me a list, Peter, I&rsquo;ll track them down. I don&rsquo;t care if it was Captain America himself, I will do it. Not that I think Steve would do that, mind you, but it&rsquo;s the thought that counts. I\u2019ll beat up anyone for you, I will kick my own ass if I need to.&rdquo; <br/><br/>That just made Peter laugh harder. &ldquo;Thanks Tony, but that would be sort of self-defeating.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Tony asked, suddenly confused. He wasn&rsquo;t often confused he felt like, but with Peter it was touch and go. This must be what Pepper was talking about when she said she couldn&rsquo;t follow his train of thought. <br/><br/>Peter froze. &ldquo;Uh, nothing. Nothing at all. I&rsquo;ll just go call Strange. Or maybe Thor, he has Loki with him right now I think, but asking Loki questions tends to end poorly for me so Thor is the safe option to still get information.&rdquo; With that, he took off for the mansion, walking as fast as he could without running. <br/><br/>Tony stared after him, bemused. He wanted to chase after him and figure out what was going on, but Peter could avoid like nobody&rsquo;s business when he put his mind to it. Tony sighed and turned to the blank spot. Might as well look into it while he was here. <br/>~~~<br/>The next time Tony saw him, he was stuck to the ceiling looking miserable. Tony whistled sharply to get his attention&ndash; calling out to him had been proven not to work in the past. &ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Uh- hi.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;You want to come down here so we can talk?&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Not really.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Will you anyways? Please?&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why,&rdquo; Peter grumbled. <br/><br/>&ldquo;Because I think you&rsquo;re mad at me and I wanted to ask you why so I can figure out how to make it better.&rdquo; Historically, waiting for things to get better didn\u2019t end well for him. <br/><br/>Peter dropped from the ceiling in a well-practiced flip that looked&ndash; and probably was&ndash; effortless. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong. I&rsquo;m not mad at you, jesus Tony. I&rsquo;ve been mad at you exactly once, and I said it right to your face.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;You did, and I appreciate that because passive aggressive doesn&rsquo;t work for me, but that doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that you&rsquo;re avoiding me.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t even been a day, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s enough time to be considered 'avoiding&rsquo;.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;It is for us,&rdquo; Tony argued. &ldquo;Look Peter, if you don&rsquo;t want me to poke my nose in your love life, I won&rsquo;t, I just need you to say it. Preferably right now so I don&rsquo;t make an ass of myself.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not- oh god.&rdquo; Peter covered his face with his hands. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like that Tony. I- I like you, that&rsquo;s why I can&rsquo;t talk to you about it.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Tony&rsquo;s mouth worked but no words came out. &ldquo;Uh Peter? I don&rsquo;t think you like me.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Peter peeked through his hands. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t expecting this reaction, I&rsquo;m not prepared,&rdquo; he mumbled to himself. He dropped his hands back to his side. &ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m- what, lying about liking you?&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Not lying, just confused.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve liked people before Tony, I think I know how it feels by now.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you do, but- Peter you&rsquo;re young.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;And&hellip;?&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not. Even if you did like me, I don&rsquo;t think it would go very well, and besides, you just have a mentor crush.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;No, I had a mentor crush on you when we first met, and then it went away. I&rsquo;ve dated since then, and now here we are.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Yeah. Pretty fucking sure. I&rsquo;ve been trying to ask you out for like a month, and you didn&rsquo;t even notice. It\u2019s possible you were blowing me off on purpose but I was really hoping that you just didn&rsquo;t know I was asking.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;I definitely did not know that you were asking me on dates. Wait, is that why you were asking me about flowers the other day? You know you don&rsquo;t have to bring flowers on a date unless you&rsquo;re corny romantic or old fashioned, right? It might be a good move if you were dating Steve, but me,&rdquo; he shrugged. <br/><br/>Peter rolled his eyes. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t going to bring you flowers, I was trying to ask if you wanted to go that garden with me. It&rsquo;s spring, everything good is blooming. MJ said it&rsquo;s really pretty, so I thought you might want to go because you like pretty things, especially flowers. You try and pretend like you don&rsquo;t, but I&rsquo;ve seen your art collection.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Pepper collected all that.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Not your fancy art collection with all the big names, I mean the paintings you have hung up around here. You know, the ones with the flowers.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Tony just looked at him blankly. <br/><br/>&ldquo;You know, the one above the fireplace? It&rsquo;s all red and blue flowers. It&rsquo;s a really good painting Tony, and I asked Pepper once, and she said you bought that one yourself. Do you know the one I&rsquo;m talking about?&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;I know which painting you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Then why do you look like that?&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;I- uh. I need some time to think about this.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Peter nodded, a hand going up to ruffle his hair nervously. &ldquo;Yeah, of course. I&rsquo;ll uh- I&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow?&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Sure. Oh and good work with the tree.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Peter frowned in confusion. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get it back.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;No, I meant with vanishing it.&rdquo; He shot Peter a grin. &ldquo;I always hated that thing. If you can&rsquo;t get it back, that&rsquo;s the opposite of a problem. Just so you know.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep that in mind,&rdquo; Peter said with a small returning smile before he shuffled away. <br/><br/>Tony sighed and went to his room. He didn\u2019t spend much time in there, preferring to stick to common areas or the \u2018shop when he wanted to think. Today though, he needed a place to think where he wouldn&rsquo;t be interrupted, and the only place he could think of was his bedroom. <br/><br/>Peter liked him? That was&hellip; possible, apparently, just highly improbable. Yet here they were. With Peter being so nervous that he tripped while holding an alien artifact. Tony hadn&rsquo;t been lying to him&ndash; he hated that tree. It was the principle of the matter though. It could have had such a worse outcome than a stupid tree that only the city cared about. What if that artifact had been explosive? Peter could have blown himself up, and because he was distracted by Tony of all people. <br/><br/>Peter liked him, and he seemed convinced that it was real and not some passing crush. It&rsquo;s not that Tony thought Peter was too young, it&rsquo;s that he thought himself too old. He was forty: a solid fifteen years older than Peter. And&hellip; yeah maybe he&rsquo;d had a few fantasies since Spiderman had become an Avenger, but he was a dirty old man, as long as he kept his hands to himself and felt bad about it, it was fine. Mostly. Sort of. Okay, but the point is that it wasn&rsquo;t fine at all now that there was an actual chance of it happening. <br/><br/>Tony&rsquo;s mind was spinning in circles, so he did what he always did in these situations. He called Rhodey. &ldquo;Hey honey bear.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Hey Tones. What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Rhodey asked, voice etched with worry. <br/><br/>&ldquo;What makes you think something&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; <br/><br/>There was a pause and the sound of a door closing followed by Rhodey sighing. &ldquo;Nothing, I just needed to get out of that meeting. Saying that Iron Man is calling me got me part of the way out, I just needed to sound all concerned to make it all the way. What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;You know Peter?&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Your spiderling? Yeah. He alright?&rdquo; <br/><br/>Tony flubbed on trying to say that he was fine and settled with, &ldquo;Why did you call him my spiderling?&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;You hang out all the time, and- I mean, Tony if you were a cartoon you&rsquo;d have pumping heart eyes every time he walks into the room. Not that that&rsquo;s a bad thing, he&rsquo;s a good guy, and it&rsquo;s nice to see you so in love. Unless he cheated on you or something and that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re calling. If that&rsquo;s what happened, I hate him and we\u2019ll go get wasted.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not together,&rdquo; Tony said, feeling numb. Rhodey thought they were together? This was the man that knew everything about him, whether Tony liked it or not, and he thought they were together? Maybe there was more merit to the idea than Tony had let himself think. <br/><br/>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not?&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Oh. Why not? I could&rsquo;ve sworn he looked at you the same way.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Tony said, rubbing at his forehead, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re wrong about that.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Rhodey said again, this time alight with good old fashioned nosiness. <br/><br/>&ldquo;He told me that he liked me earlier, and he says it&rsquo;s not a mentor crush.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see where the problem is coming in. This sounds like a perfect little romance.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so much older than him, Rhodey,&rdquo; Tony whined. <br/><br/>&ldquo;You act like a twenty three year old at most.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;I have it on good authority that it doesn&rsquo;t matter how old or young you act when it comes to shit like this. He\u2019s fifteen years younger than me.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not underage, Tones, he&rsquo;s an adult and a superhero. I have complete faith in Peter&rsquo;s ability to know when what he likes is unacceptable.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;You hardly ever see him.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;I see him enough to know that he loves you,&rdquo; Rhodey said, drawing out 'loves&rsquo; like he was a fourteen year old all of a sudden. <br/><br/>&ldquo;You are not helping.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;You say that, but I think that I already did. For my act of goodwill to my idiotic best friend, I now get to tease you about this endlessly.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;No. No no, you only get to tease me if it all turns out okay.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be fine, go kiss his face off.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Rhodey,&rdquo; he groaned. <br/><br/>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be fun! You can peel his mask up just enough to uncover his mouth and have a little superhero make out.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Sounds like you&rsquo;ve thought about this an awful lot. I&rsquo;m kinda worried. What have you been doing while you&rsquo;re giving me hopefully kick ass advice?&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s entirely possible that I&rsquo;ve been drinking during this conversation, but you have no proof.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Tony snorted. &ldquo;Good example Colonel.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;I learned from the best. Or you. Whatever you want to label yourself right now because I learned day drinking from you.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;I seem to remember a certain someone at MIT taking shots before finals.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Shut up and go kiss Peter. Oh, and thanks for getting me out of that meeting.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;No problem Rhodey pie. Thanks for the help.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Mhm.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Tony hung up and took several deep, calming breaths. Rhodey didn&rsquo;t tend to be wrong. Tony just needed to find Peter and talk to him before he chickened out. He scrolled through his contacts and stopped at the little hearts after Peter&rsquo;s name. He remembered adding those, but to see it in the context of the recent developments of Peter actually liking him, it was something else. <br/><br/>&ldquo;Tony? Is everything okay? I didn&rsquo;t get an alert, is my badge malfunctioning?&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s nothing like that. I was just wondering if you wanted to get dinner together.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Tonight?&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Yeah, unless you&rsquo;re busy.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Considering that my friends are out of the country and my only job is being an Avenger, it&rsquo;s pretty safe to say that my schedule is wide open.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;I was trying to give you an out, but fine, be honest if that&rsquo;s what you want,&rdquo; Tony said drily. <br/><br/>Peter chuckled. &ldquo;Do I want to know why you&rsquo;re asking me to dinner? Should I use my waterproof makeup?&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been spending time with Deadpool haven&rsquo;t you.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Maybe. He&rsquo;s entertaining.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Extremely, but as a rule, when you start talking like him, you need some space.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in South America right now. I think. Point is, he&rsquo;s not on this continent, so I have space from him whether or not I want it. Which I don&rsquo;t, really. He tends to get in trouble when he spends too long away.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed that. And it&rsquo;s you specifically, not just superheroes in general.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Yeah, he really likes Spiderman. I don&rsquo;t know why.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Probably because you&rsquo;re incredible.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Yeah I- wait what?&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;What what?&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Did you just call me incredible?&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;You know I like you, this isn&rsquo;t a surprise.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Well yeah, you like me fine, but complimenting me after I tell you that I like you is&hellip; weird.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Weird if I didn&rsquo;t ask you on a date.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;What did you think dinner tonight was?&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;A nice big public outing where you tell me thanks but no thanks so that I can&rsquo;t get upset.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Tony made a face, starting to think that he should have had this conversation face to face. &ldquo;Peter, who have you been dating? Or trying to date but it turns out that they&rsquo;re assholes.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying that that&rsquo;s happened to me, but it is a possibility.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a possibility with me, ever. Especially not with you.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Why Mister Stark that was practically romantic.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Tony could picture the way Peter was blushing even as he tried to act coy. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t count on it happening again.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Peter hummed, clearly not convinced. &ldquo;You saying that or you being romantic?&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Both.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you,&rdquo; Peter said mildly. &ldquo;So where are we going?&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;You like Italian?&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Of course I do, I&rsquo;m dating you aren&rsquo;t I? And just so you know, eating Italian on a date automatically makes it romantic. Haven&rsquo;t you seen Lady and the Tramp?&rdquo; <br/><br/>Tony just laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you at seven.&rdquo; <br/><br/>~~~<br/><br/>Tony gasped as his back hit the wall, fisting his hands in Peter&rsquo;s shirt as they kissed. <br/><br/>&ldquo;Not too fast?&rdquo; Peter asked, even as he licked and kissed his way down to the base of Tony&rsquo;s neck to suck a hickey. Tony usually wasn&rsquo;t into that because his dates were more like hookups and he didn&rsquo;t want any marks from them, but this was Peter. He tilted his neck to the side to give him more room, and Peter took it gratefully, changing the angle and sucking harder to make Tony moan. <br/><br/>&ldquo;According to Rhodey-&rdquo; Tony gasped &ldquo;-this is a long time coming.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Peter hummed. &ldquo;Rhodey&rsquo;s a smart man. You gonna let me take you to your room?&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem like you&rsquo;re letting me do anything here.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;You complaining?&rdquo; <br/><br/>Tony rolled his hips against Peter&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Definitely not.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t answer the question.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Peter if you don&rsquo;t take me to bed, I&rsquo;m going to turn rogue and blame it on Richards.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Why Richards?&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe I of all people am saying this, but do you ever stop talking?&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Not really.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Can you talk and move?&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; <br/><br/>&ldquo;Then do that.&rdquo; All of a sudden, Peter picked Tony up and started walking down the hall. &ldquo;See, this is why we&rsquo;re great together.&rdquo; <br/><br/>Peter laughed, pausing to kiss him again. &ldquo;Glad you&rsquo;re enjoying yourself.&rdquo;</p>",

He wasn\u2019t often confused he felt like, but with Peter it was touch and go. This must be what Pepper was talking about when she said she couldn\u2019t follow his train of thought. <br><br>Peter froze. \u201cUh, nothing. Nothing at all. I\u2019ll just go call Strange. Or maybe Thor, he has Loki with him right now I think, but asking Loki questions tends to end poorly for me so Thor is the safe option to still get information.\u201d With that, he took off for the mansion, walking as fast as he could without running. <br><br>Tony stared after him, bemused. He wanted to chase after him and figure out what was going on, but Peter could avoid like nobody\u2019s business when he put his mind to it. Tony sighed and turned to the blank spot. Might as well look into it while he was here. <br>~~~<br>The next time Tony saw him, he was stuck to the ceiling looking miserable. Tony whistled sharply to get his attention\u2013 calling out to him had been proven not to work in the past. \u201cHey.\u201d <br><br>\u201cUh- hi.\u201d <br><br>\u201cYou want to come down here so we can talk?\u201d <br><br>\u201cNot really.\u201d <br><br>\u201cWill you anyways? Please?\u201d <br><br>\u201cI don\u2019t see why,\u201d Peter grumbled. <br><br>\u201cBecause I think you\u2019re mad at me and I wanted to ask you why so I can figure out how to make it better.\u201d Historically, waiting for things to get better didn\u2019t end well for him. <br><br>Peter dropped from the ceiling in a well-practiced flip that looked\u2013 and probably was\u2013 effortless. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I\u2019m not mad at you, jesus Tony. I\u2019ve been mad at you exactly once, and I said it right to your face.\u201d <br><br>\u201cYou did, and I appreciate that because passive aggressive doesn\u2019t work for me, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that you\u2019re avoiding me.\u201d <br><br>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t even been a day, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s enough time to be considered 'avoiding\u2019.\u201d <br><br>\u201cIt is for us,\u201d Tony argued. \u201cLook Peter, if you don\u2019t want me to poke my nose in your love life, I won\u2019t, I just need you to say it. Preferably right now so I don\u2019t make an ass of myself.\u201d <br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s not- oh god.\u201d Peter covered his face with his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that Tony. I- I like you, that\u2019s why I can\u2019t talk to you about it.\u201d <br><br>Tony\u2019s mouth worked but no words came out. \u201cUh Peter? I don\u2019t think you like me.\u201d <br><br>Peter peeked through his hands. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting this reaction, I\u2019m not prepared,\u201d he mumbled to himself. He dropped his hands back to his side. \u201cYou think I\u2019m- what, lying about liking you?\u201d <br><br>\u201cNot lying, just confused.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI\u2019ve liked people before Tony, I think I know how it feels by now.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI\u2019m sure you do, but- Peter you\u2019re young.\u201d <br><br>\u201cAnd\u2026?\u201d <br><br>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not. Even if you did like me, I don\u2019t think it would go very well, and besides, you just have a mentor crush.\u201d <br><br>\u201cNo, I had a mentor crush on you when we first met, and then it went away. I\u2019ve dated since then, and now here we are.\u201d <br><br>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d <br><br>\u201cYeah. Pretty fucking sure. I\u2019ve been trying to ask you out for like a month, and you didn\u2019t even notice. It\u2019s possible you were blowing me off on purpose but I was really hoping that you just didn\u2019t know I was asking.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI definitely did not know that you were asking me on dates. Wait, is that why you were asking me about flowers the other day? You know you don\u2019t have to bring flowers on a date unless you\u2019re corny romantic or old fashioned, right? It might be a good move if you were dating Steve, but me,\u201d he shrugged. <br><br>Peter rolled his eyes. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to bring you flowers, I was trying to ask if you wanted to go that garden with me. It\u2019s spring, everything good is blooming. MJ said it\u2019s really pretty, so I thought you might want to go because you like pretty things, especially flowers. You try and pretend like you don\u2019t, but I\u2019ve seen your art collection.\u201d <br><br>\u201cPepper collected all that.\u201d <br><br>\u201cNot your fancy art collection with all the big names, I mean the paintings you have hung up around here. You know, the ones with the flowers.\u201d <br><br>Tony just looked at him blankly. <br><br>\u201cYou know, the one above the fireplace? It\u2019s all red and blue flowers. It\u2019s a really good painting Tony, and I asked Pepper once, and she said you bought that one yourself. Do you know the one I\u2019m talking about?\u201d <br><br>\u201cI know which painting you\u2019re talking about.\u201d <br><br>\u201cThen why do you look like that?\u201d <br><br>\u201cI- uh. I need some time to think about this.\u201d <br><br>Peter nodded, a hand going up to ruffle his hair nervously. \u201cYeah, of course. I\u2019ll uh- I\u2019ll see you tomorrow?\u201d <br><br>\u201cSure. Oh and good work with the tree.\u201d <br><br>Peter frowned in confusion. \u201cI didn\u2019t get it back.\u201d <br><br>\u201cNo, I meant with vanishing it.\u201d He shot Peter a grin. \u201cI always hated that thing. If you can\u2019t get it back, that\u2019s the opposite of a problem. Just so you know.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d Peter said with a small returning smile before he shuffled away. <br><br>Tony sighed and went to his room. He didn\u2019t spend much time in there, preferring to stick to common areas or the \u2018shop when he wanted to think. Today though, he needed a place to think where he wouldn\u2019t be interrupted, and the only place he could think of was his bedroom. <br><br>Peter liked him? That was\u2026 possible, apparently, just highly improbable. Yet here they were. With Peter being so nervous that he tripped while holding an alien artifact. Tony hadn\u2019t been lying to him\u2013 he hated that tree. It was the principle of the matter though. It could have had such a worse outcome than a stupid tree that only the city cared about. What if that artifact had been explosive? Peter could have blown himself up, and because he was distracted by Tony of all people. <br><br>Peter liked him, and he seemed convinced that it was real and not some passing crush. It\u2019s not that Tony thought Peter was too young, it\u2019s that he thought himself too old. He was forty: a solid fifteen years older than Peter. And\u2026 yeah maybe he\u2019d had a few fantasies since Spiderman had become an Avenger, but he was a dirty old man, as long as he kept his hands to himself and felt bad about it, it was fine. Mostly. Sort of. Okay, but the point is that it wasn\u2019t fine at all now that there was an actual chance of it happening. <br><br>Tony\u2019s mind was spinning in circles, so he did what he always did in these situations. He called Rhodey. \u201cHey honey bear.\u201d <br><br>\u201cHey Tones. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Rhodey asked, voice etched with worry. <br><br>\u201cWhat makes you think something\u2019s wrong?\u201d <br><br>There was a pause and the sound of a door closing followed by Rhodey sighing. \u201cNothing, I just needed to get out of that meeting. Saying that Iron Man is calling me got me part of the way out, I just needed to sound all concerned to make it all the way. What\u2019s up?\u201d <br><br>\u201cYou know Peter?\u201d <br><br>\u201cYour spiderling? Yeah. He alright?\u201d <br><br>Tony flubbed on trying to say that he was fine and settled with, \u201cWhy did you call him my spiderling?\u201d <br><br>\u201cYou hang out all the time, and- I mean, Tony if you were a cartoon you\u2019d have pumping heart eyes every time he walks into the room. Not that that\u2019s a bad thing, he\u2019s a good guy, and it\u2019s nice to see you so in love. Unless he cheated on you or something and that\u2019s why you\u2019re calling. If that\u2019s what happened, I hate him and we\u2019ll go get wasted.\u201d <br><br>\u201cWe\u2019re not together,\u201d Tony said, feeling numb. Rhodey thought they were together? This was the man that knew everything about him, whether Tony liked it or not, and he thought they were together? Maybe there was more merit to the idea than Tony had let himself think. <br><br>\u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d <br><br>\u201cNo.\u201d <br><br>\u201cOh. Why not? I could\u2019ve sworn he looked at you the same way.\u201d <br><br>\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony said, rubbing at his forehead, \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong about that.\u201d <br><br>\u201cOh?\u201d Rhodey said again, this time alight with good old fashioned nosiness. <br><br>\u201cHe told me that he liked me earlier, and he says it\u2019s not a mentor crush.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI don\u2019t see where the problem is coming in. This sounds like a perfect little romance.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI\u2019m so much older than him, Rhodey,\u201d Tony whined. <br><br>\u201cYou act like a twenty three year old at most.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI have it on good authority that it doesn\u2019t matter how old or young you act when it comes to shit like this. He\u2019s fifteen years younger than me.\u201d <br><br>\u201cHe\u2019s not underage, Tones, he\u2019s an adult and a superhero. I have complete faith in Peter\u2019s ability to know when what he likes is unacceptable.\u201d <br><br>\u201cYou hardly ever see him.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI see him enough to know that he loves you,\u201d Rhodey said, drawing out 'loves\u2019 like he was a fourteen year old all of a sudden. <br><br>\u201cYou are not helping.\u201d <br><br>\u201cYou say that, but I think that I already did. For my act of goodwill to my idiotic best friend, I now get to tease you about this endlessly.\u201d <br><br>\u201cNo. No no, you only get to tease me if it all turns out okay.\u201d <br><br>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine, go kiss his face off.\u201d <br><br>\u201cRhodey,\u201d he groaned. <br><br>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fun! You can peel his mask up just enough to uncover his mouth and have a little superhero make out.\u201d <br><br>\u201cSounds like you\u2019ve thought about this an awful lot. I\u2019m kinda worried. What have you been doing while you\u2019re giving me hopefully kick ass advice?\u201d <br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s entirely possible that I\u2019ve been drinking during this conversation, but you have no proof.\u201d <br><br>Tony snorted. \u201cGood example Colonel.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI learned from the best. Or you. Whatever you want to label yourself right now because I learned day drinking from you.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI seem to remember a certain someone at MIT taking shots before finals.\u201d <br><br>\u201cShut up and go kiss Peter. Oh, and thanks for getting me out of that meeting.\u201d <br><br>\u201cNo problem Rhodey pie. Thanks for the help.\u201d <br><br>\u201cMhm.\u201d <br><br>Tony hung up and took several deep, calming breaths. Rhodey didn\u2019t tend to be wrong. Tony just needed to find Peter and talk to him before he chickened out. He scrolled through his contacts and stopped at the little hearts after Peter\u2019s name. He remembered adding those, but to see it in the context of the recent developments of Peter actually liking him, it was something else. <br><br>\u201cTony? Is everything okay? I didn\u2019t get an alert, is my badge malfunctioning?\u201d <br><br>\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing like that. I was just wondering if you wanted to get dinner together.\u201d <br><br>\u201cTonight?\u201d <br><br>\u201cYeah, unless you\u2019re busy.\u201d <br><br>\u201cConsidering that my friends are out of the country and my only job is being an Avenger, it\u2019s pretty safe to say that my schedule is wide open.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI was trying to give you an out, but fine, be honest if that\u2019s what you want,\u201d Tony said drily. <br><br>Peter chuckled. \u201cDo I want to know why you\u2019re asking me to dinner? Should I use my waterproof makeup?\u201d <br><br>\u201cYou\u2019ve been spending time with Deadpool haven\u2019t you.\u201d <br><br>\u201cMaybe. He\u2019s entertaining.\u201d <br><br>\u201cExtremely, but as a rule, when you start talking like him, you need some space.\u201d <br><br>\u201cHe\u2019s in South America right now. I think. Point is, he\u2019s not on this continent, so I have space from him whether or not I want it. Which I don\u2019t, really. He tends to get in trouble when he spends too long away.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI\u2019ve noticed that. And it\u2019s you specifically, not just superheroes in general.\u201d <br><br>\u201cYeah, he really likes Spiderman. I don\u2019t know why.\u201d <br><br>\u201cProbably because you\u2019re incredible.\u201d <br><br>\u201cYeah I- wait what?\u201d <br><br>\u201cWhat what?\u201d <br><br>\u201cDid you just call me incredible?\u201d <br><br>\u201cYou know I like you, this isn\u2019t a surprise.\u201d <br><br>\u201cWell yeah, you like me fine, but complimenting me after I tell you that I like you is\u2026 weird.\u201d <br><br>\u201cWeird if I didn\u2019t ask you on a date.\u201d <br><br>\u201cHuh?\u201d <br><br>\u201cWhat did you think dinner tonight was?\u201d <br><br>\u201cA nice big public outing where you tell me thanks but no thanks so that I can\u2019t get upset.\u201d <br><br>Tony made a face, starting to think that he should have had this conversation face to face. \u201cPeter, who have you been dating? Or trying to date but it turns out that they\u2019re assholes.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that that\u2019s happened to me, but it is a possibility.\u201d <br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s not a possibility with me, ever. Especially not with you.\u201d <br><br>\u201cWhy Mister Stark that was practically romantic.\u201d <br><br>Tony could picture the way Peter was blushing even as he tried to act coy. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t count on it happening again.\u201d <br><br>Peter hummed, clearly not convinced. \u201cYou saying that or you being romantic?\u201d <br><br>\u201cBoth.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d Peter said mildly. \u201cSo where are we going?\u201d <br><br>\u201cYou like Italian?\u201d <br><br>\u201cOf course I do, I\u2019m dating you aren\u2019t I? And just so you know, eating Italian on a date automatically makes it romantic. Haven\u2019t you seen Lady and the Tramp?\u201d <br><br>Tony just laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at seven.\u201d <br><br>~~~<br><br>Tony gasped as his back hit the wall, fisting his hands in Peter\u2019s shirt as they kissed. <br><br>\u201cNot too fast?\u201d Peter asked, even as he licked and kissed his way down to the base of Tony\u2019s neck to suck a hickey. Tony usually wasn\u2019t into that because his dates were more like hookups and he didn\u2019t want any marks from them, but this was Peter. He tilted his neck to the side to give him more room, and Peter took it gratefully, changing the angle and sucking harder to make Tony moan. <br><br>\u201cAccording to Rhodey-\u201d Tony gasped \u201c-this is a long time coming.\u201d <br><br>Peter hummed. \u201cRhodey\u2019s a smart man. You gonna let me take you to your room?\u201d <br><br>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re letting me do anything here.\u201d <br><br>\u201cYou complaining?\u201d <br><br>Tony rolled his hips against Peter\u2019s. \u201cDefinitely not.\u201d <br><br>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer the question.\u201d <br><br>\u201cPeter if you don\u2019t take me to bed, I\u2019m going to turn rogue and blame it on Richards.\u201d <br><br>\u201cWhy Richards?\u201d <br><br>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I of all people am saying this, but do you ever stop talking?\u201d <br><br>\u201cNot really.\u201d <br><br>\u201cCan you talk and move?\u201d <br><br>\u201cYeah.\u201d <br><br>\u201cThen do that.\u201d All of a sudden, Peter picked Tony up and started walking down the hall. \u201cSee, this is why we\u2019re great together.\u201d <br><br>Peter laughed, pausing to kiss him again. \u201cGlad you\u2019re enjoying yourself.\u201d</p>",

Next to him, Peter was wringing his hands, looking between Tony and the newly blank space. <br><br>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Tony, I don\u2019t know what happened. One minute I was walking along with the artifact like I was supposed to, and then I tripped and it- okay there was a flash of purple light and it hit the tree and it vanished. And- and then I went and got you. It only took five minutes, tops, I swear I didn\u2019t do this earlier and just forgot to get you.\u201d <br><br>\u201cYou\u2026 tripped,\u201d Tony repeated doubtfully. Peter did have a nervous energy about him, but he was always graceful (in body at least). He ran into things sometimes when he and Tony were talking, but it was always preceded by senseless babbling about flowers and food and because he was backing away without looking where he was going. Tony did not believe that Peter just up and tripped while walking all by himself. <br><br>Peter nodded though, looking painfully earnest like Cap did when he first came out of the ice. <br><br>\u201cPeter, you don\u2019t trip.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI do sometimes!\u201d he said defensively. <br><br>\u201cWhen you\u2019re talking to someone maybe, not just while you\u2019re walking. Peter, it\u2019s okay if you messed up, we all fuck up sometimes. You want to tell me what really happened?\u201d <br><br>\u201cI did! I\u2019m not lying Tony, jesus christ.\u201d <br><br>\u201cOkay, so you were walking and tripped. What did you trip over?\u201d <br><br>He shifted uncomfortably. \u201cIt might have been a rock, but it might also have been my own foot.\u201d <br><br>Tony frowned, concerned. \u201cYou\u2019ve been out of it for a couple weeks, is everything alright?\u201d <br><br>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to ask me more about the missing tree?\u201d Peter asked, turning back to the spot with obviously fake interest. \u201cIt\u2019s quite the conundrum, all the roots still look like they\u2019re in the ground, and the little plaque is still there, but the actual trunk and everything above it is missing. Strange indeed. And I did walk where it used to be to make sure it wasn\u2019t invisible or cloaked or something.\u201d <br><br>\u201cGood to know that it\u2019s missing and not hiding in plain sight,\u201d Tony agreed. \u201cWhat are you thinking about that\u2019s got you like this?\u201d <br><br>\u201cI\u2019d rather not talk about it,\u201d Peter said quietly, not looking at him. <br><br>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to talk to me if you don\u2019t want to, but I think you need to talk to someone. It\u2019s been weeks, and nothing\u2019s changed with you. It hasn\u2019t affected your fighting yet, but I don\u2019t want to wait for that to happen for you to deal with this\u2013 whatever \u2018this\u2019 might be.\"\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>\"It\u2019s\u2026\u201d Peter ruffled his hair as his cheeks pinked. \u201cI like someone, and they don\u2019t feel the same.\u201d <br><br>\u201cYou sure about that? Cause no offense Peter, you\u2019re nothing to sniff at.\u201d <br><br>\u201cWhy would I be offended by that?\u201d <br><br>Tony shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m older than you, you might think it was weird. My point is, you\u2019re not acting like someone who\u2019s been turned down, you\u2019re acting like someone who\u2019s pining and also doesn\u2019t know that they\u2019re a catch. You\u2019re Spiderman! Come on, who wouldn\u2019t want to date you?\u201d <br><br>\u201cI can think of a few people.\u201d <br><br>\u201cVillains don\u2019t count.\u201d <br><br>Peter snorted. \u201cYeah, I wasn\u2019t thinking about villains. Quite the opposite.\u201d <br><br>\u201cHave other heroes been talking shit? Tell me who, I\u2019ll kick their ass.\u201d When Peter started laughing, Tony added, \u201cI\u2019m serious. Give me a list, Peter, I\u2019ll track them down. I don\u2019t care if it was Captain America himself, I will do it. Not that I think Steve would do that, mind you, but it\u2019s the thought that counts. I\u2019ll beat up anyone for you, I will kick my own ass if I need to.\u201d <br><br>That just made Peter laugh harder. \u201cThanks Tony, but that would be sort of self-defeating.\u201d <br><br>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony asked, suddenly confused. He wasn\u2019t often confused he felt like, but with Peter it was touch and go. This must be what Pepper was talking about when she said she couldn\u2019t follow his train of thought. <br><br>Peter froze. \u201cUh, nothing. Nothing at all. I\u2019ll just go call Strange. Or maybe Thor, he has Loki with him right now I think, but asking Loki questions tends to end poorly for me so Thor is the safe option to still get information.\u201d With that, he took off for the mansion, walking as fast as he could without running. <br><br>Tony stared after him, bemused. He wanted to chase after him and figure out what was going on, but Peter could avoid like nobody\u2019s business when he put his mind to it. Tony sighed and turned to the blank spot. Might as well look into it while he was here. <br>~~~<br>The next time Tony saw him, he was stuck to the ceiling looking miserable. Tony whistled sharply to get his attention\u2013 calling out to him had been proven not to work in the past. \u201cHey.\u201d <br><br>\u201cUh- hi.\u201d <br><br>\u201cYou want to come down here so we can talk?\u201d <br><br>\u201cNot really.\u201d <br><br>\u201cWill you anyways? Please?\u201d <br><br>\u201cI don\u2019t see why,\u201d Peter grumbled. <br><br>\u201cBecause I think you\u2019re mad at me and I wanted to ask you why so I can figure out how to make it better.\u201d Historically, waiting for things to get better didn\u2019t end well for him. <br><br>Peter dropped from the ceiling in a well-practiced flip that looked\u2013 and probably was\u2013 effortless. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I\u2019m not mad at you, jesus Tony. I\u2019ve been mad at you exactly once, and I said it right to your face.\u201d <br><br>\u201cYou did, and I appreciate that because passive aggressive doesn\u2019t work for me, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that you\u2019re avoiding me.\u201d <br><br>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t even been a day, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s enough time to be considered 'avoiding\u2019.\u201d <br><br>\u201cIt is for us,\u201d Tony argued. \u201cLook Peter, if you don\u2019t want me to poke my nose in your love life, I won\u2019t, I just need you to say it. Preferably right now so I don\u2019t make an ass of myself.\u201d <br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s not- oh god.\u201d Peter covered his face with his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that Tony. I- I like you, that\u2019s why I can\u2019t talk to you about it.\u201d <br><br>Tony\u2019s mouth worked but no words came out. \u201cUh Peter? I don\u2019t think you like me.\u201d <br><br>Peter peeked through his hands. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting this reaction, I\u2019m not prepared,\u201d he mumbled to himself. He dropped his hands back to his side. \u201cYou think I\u2019m- what, lying about liking you?\u201d <br><br>\u201cNot lying, just confused.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI\u2019ve liked people before Tony, I think I know how it feels by now.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI\u2019m sure you do, but- Peter you\u2019re young.\u201d <br><br>\u201cAnd\u2026?\u201d <br><br>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not. Even if you did like me, I don\u2019t think it would go very well, and besides, you just have a mentor crush.\u201d <br><br>\u201cNo, I had a mentor crush on you when we first met, and then it went away. I\u2019ve dated since then, and now here we are.\u201d <br><br>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d <br><br>\u201cYeah. Pretty fucking sure. I\u2019ve been trying to ask you out for like a month, and you didn\u2019t even notice. It\u2019s possible you were blowing me off on purpose but I was really hoping that you just didn\u2019t know I was asking.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI definitely did not know that you were asking me on dates. Wait, is that why you were asking me about flowers the other day? You know you don\u2019t have to bring flowers on a date unless you\u2019re corny romantic or old fashioned, right? It might be a good move if you were dating Steve, but me,\u201d he shrugged. <br><br>Peter rolled his eyes. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to bring you flowers, I was trying to ask if you wanted to go that garden with me. It\u2019s spring, everything good is blooming. MJ said it\u2019s really pretty, so I thought you might want to go because you like pretty things, especially flowers. You try and pretend like you don\u2019t, but I\u2019ve seen your art collection.\u201d <br><br>\u201cPepper collected all that.\u201d <br><br>\u201cNot your fancy art collection with all the big names, I mean the paintings you have hung up around here. You know, the ones with the flowers.\u201d <br><br>Tony just looked at him blankly. <br><br>\u201cYou know, the one above the fireplace? It\u2019s all red and blue flowers. It\u2019s a really good painting Tony, and I asked Pepper once, and she said you bought that one yourself. Do you know the one I\u2019m talking about?\u201d <br><br>\u201cI know which painting you\u2019re talking about.\u201d <br><br>\u201cThen why do you look like that?\u201d <br><br>\u201cI- uh. I need some time to think about this.\u201d <br><br>Peter nodded, a hand going up to ruffle his hair nervously. \u201cYeah, of course. I\u2019ll uh- I\u2019ll see you tomorrow?\u201d <br><br>\u201cSure. Oh and good work with the tree.\u201d <br><br>Peter frowned in confusion. \u201cI didn\u2019t get it back.\u201d <br><br>\u201cNo, I meant with vanishing it.\u201d He shot Peter a grin. \u201cI always hated that thing. If you can\u2019t get it back, that\u2019s the opposite of a problem. Just so you know.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d Peter said with a small returning smile before he shuffled away. <br><br>Tony sighed and went to his room. He didn\u2019t spend much time in there, preferring to stick to common areas or the \u2018shop when he wanted to think. Today though, he needed a place to think where he wouldn\u2019t be interrupted, and the only place he could think of was his bedroom. <br><br>Peter liked him? That was\u2026 possible, apparently, just highly improbable. Yet here they were. With Peter being so nervous that he tripped while holding an alien artifact. Tony hadn\u2019t been lying to him\u2013 he hated that tree. It was the principle of the matter though. It could have had such a worse outcome than a stupid tree that only the city cared about. What if that artifact had been explosive? Peter could have blown himself up, and because he was distracted by Tony of all people. <br><br>Peter liked him, and he seemed convinced that it was real and not some passing crush. It\u2019s not that Tony thought Peter was too young, it\u2019s that he thought himself too old. He was forty: a solid fifteen years older than Peter. And\u2026 yeah maybe he\u2019d had a few fantasies since Spiderman had become an Avenger, but he was a dirty old man, as long as he kept his hands to himself and felt bad about it, it was fine. Mostly. Sort of. Okay, but the point is that it wasn\u2019t fine at all now that there was an actual chance of it happening. <br><br>Tony\u2019s mind was spinning in circles, so he did what he always did in these situations. He called Rhodey. \u201cHey honey bear.\u201d <br><br>\u201cHey Tones. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Rhodey asked, voice etched with worry. <br><br>\u201cWhat makes you think something\u2019s wrong?\u201d <br><br>There was a pause and the sound of a door closing followed by Rhodey sighing. \u201cNothing, I just needed to get out of that meeting. Saying that Iron Man is calling me got me part of the way out, I just needed to sound all concerned to make it all the way. What\u2019s up?\u201d <br><br>\u201cYou know Peter?\u201d <br><br>\u201cYour spiderling? Yeah. He alright?\u201d <br><br>Tony flubbed on trying to say that he was fine and settled with, \u201cWhy did you call him my spiderling?\u201d <br><br>\u201cYou hang out all the time, and- I mean, Tony if you were a cartoon you\u2019d have pumping heart eyes every time he walks into the room. Not that that\u2019s a bad thing, he\u2019s a good guy, and it\u2019s nice to see you so in love. Unless he cheated on you or something and that\u2019s why you\u2019re calling. If that\u2019s what happened, I hate him and we\u2019ll go get wasted.\u201d <br><br>\u201cWe\u2019re not together,\u201d Tony said, feeling numb. Rhodey thought they were together? This was the man that knew everything about him, whether Tony liked it or not, and he thought they were together? Maybe there was more merit to the idea than Tony had let himself think. <br><br>\u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d <br><br>\u201cNo.\u201d <br><br>\u201cOh. Why not? I could\u2019ve sworn he looked at you the same way.\u201d <br><br>\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony said, rubbing at his forehead, \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong about that.\u201d <br><br>\u201cOh?\u201d Rhodey said again, this time alight with good old fashioned nosiness. <br><br>\u201cHe told me that he liked me earlier, and he says it\u2019s not a mentor crush.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI don\u2019t see where the problem is coming in. This sounds like a perfect little romance.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI\u2019m so much older than him, Rhodey,\u201d Tony whined. <br><br>\u201cYou act like a twenty three year old at most.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI have it on good authority that it doesn\u2019t matter how old or young you act when it comes to shit like this. He\u2019s fifteen years younger than me.\u201d <br><br>\u201cHe\u2019s not underage, Tones, he\u2019s an adult and a superhero. I have complete faith in Peter\u2019s ability to know when what he likes is unacceptable.\u201d <br><br>\u201cYou hardly ever see him.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI see him enough to know that he loves you,\u201d Rhodey said, drawing out 'loves\u2019 like he was a fourteen year old all of a sudden. <br><br>\u201cYou are not helping.\u201d <br><br>\u201cYou say that, but I think that I already did. For my act of goodwill to my idiotic best friend, I now get to tease you about this endlessly.\u201d <br><br>\u201cNo. No no, you only get to tease me if it all turns out okay.\u201d <br><br>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine, go kiss his face off.\u201d <br><br>\u201cRhodey,\u201d he groaned. <br><br>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fun! You can peel his mask up just enough to uncover his mouth and have a little superhero make out.\u201d <br><br>\u201cSounds like you\u2019ve thought about this an awful lot. I\u2019m kinda worried. What have you been doing while you\u2019re giving me hopefully kick ass advice?\u201d <br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s entirely possible that I\u2019ve been drinking during this conversation, but you have no proof.\u201d <br><br>Tony snorted. \u201cGood example Colonel.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI learned from the best. Or you. Whatever you want to label yourself right now because I learned day drinking from you.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI seem to remember a certain someone at MIT taking shots before finals.\u201d <br><br>\u201cShut up and go kiss Peter. Oh, and thanks for getting me out of that meeting.\u201d <br><br>\u201cNo problem Rhodey pie. Thanks for the help.\u201d <br><br>\u201cMhm.\u201d <br><br>Tony hung up and took several deep, calming breaths. Rhodey didn\u2019t tend to be wrong. Tony just needed to find Peter and talk to him before he chickened out. He scrolled through his contacts and stopped at the little hearts after Peter\u2019s name. He remembered adding those, but to see it in the context of the recent developments of Peter actually liking him, it was something else. <br><br>\u201cTony? Is everything okay? I didn\u2019t get an alert, is my badge malfunctioning?\u201d <br><br>\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing like that. I was just wondering if you wanted to get dinner together.\u201d <br><br>\u201cTonight?\u201d <br><br>\u201cYeah, unless you\u2019re busy.\u201d <br><br>\u201cConsidering that my friends are out of the country and my only job is being an Avenger, it\u2019s pretty safe to say that my schedule is wide open.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI was trying to give you an out, but fine, be honest if that\u2019s what you want,\u201d Tony said drily. <br><br>Peter chuckled. \u201cDo I want to know why you\u2019re asking me to dinner? Should I use my waterproof makeup?\u201d <br><br>\u201cYou\u2019ve been spending time with Deadpool haven\u2019t you.\u201d <br><br>\u201cMaybe. He\u2019s entertaining.\u201d <br><br>\u201cExtremely, but as a rule, when you start talking like him, you need some space.\u201d <br><br>\u201cHe\u2019s in South America right now. I think. Point is, he\u2019s not on this continent, so I have space from him whether or not I want it. Which I don\u2019t, really. He tends to get in trouble when he spends too long away.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI\u2019ve noticed that. And it\u2019s you specifically, not just superheroes in general.\u201d <br><br>\u201cYeah, he really likes Spiderman. I don\u2019t know why.\u201d <br><br>\u201cProbably because you\u2019re incredible.\u201d <br><br>\u201cYeah I- wait what?\u201d <br><br>\u201cWhat what?\u201d <br><br>\u201cDid you just call me incredible?\u201d <br><br>\u201cYou know I like you, this isn\u2019t a surprise.\u201d <br><br>\u201cWell yeah, you like me fine, but complimenting me after I tell you that I like you is\u2026 weird.\u201d <br><br>\u201cWeird if I didn\u2019t ask you on a date.\u201d <br><br>\u201cHuh?\u201d <br><br>\u201cWhat did you think dinner tonight was?\u201d <br><br>\u201cA nice big public outing where you tell me thanks but no thanks so that I can\u2019t get upset.\u201d <br><br>Tony made a face, starting to think that he should have had this conversation face to face. \u201cPeter, who have you been dating? Or trying to date but it turns out that they\u2019re assholes.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that that\u2019s happened to me, but it is a possibility.\u201d <br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s not a possibility with me, ever. Especially not with you.\u201d <br><br>\u201cWhy Mister Stark that was practically romantic.\u201d <br><br>Tony could picture the way Peter was blushing even as he tried to act coy. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t count on it happening again.\u201d <br><br>Peter hummed, clearly not convinced. \u201cYou saying that or you being romantic?\u201d <br><br>\u201cBoth.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d Peter said mildly. \u201cSo where are we going?\u201d <br><br>\u201cYou like Italian?\u201d <br><br>\u201cOf course I do, I\u2019m dating you aren\u2019t I? And just so you know, eating Italian on a date automatically makes it romantic. Haven\u2019t you seen Lady and the Tramp?\u201d <br><br>Tony just laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at seven.\u201d <br><br>~~~<br><br>Tony gasped as his back hit the wall, fisting his hands in Peter\u2019s shirt as they kissed. <br><br>\u201cNot too fast?\u201d Peter asked, even as he licked and kissed his way down to the base of Tony\u2019s neck to suck a hickey. Tony usually wasn\u2019t into that because his dates were more like hookups and he didn\u2019t want any marks from them, but this was Peter. He tilted his neck to the side to give him more room, and Peter took it gratefully, changing the angle and sucking harder to make Tony moan. <br><br>\u201cAccording to Rhodey-\u201d Tony gasped \u201c-this is a long time coming.\u201d <br><br>Peter hummed. \u201cRhodey\u2019s a smart man. You gonna let me take you to your room?\u201d <br><br>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re letting me do anything here.\u201d <br><br>\u201cYou complaining?\u201d <br><br>Tony rolled his hips against Peter\u2019s. \u201cDefinitely not.\u201d <br><br>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer the question.\u201d <br><br>\u201cPeter if you don\u2019t take me to bed, I\u2019m going to turn rogue and blame it on Richards.\u201d <br><br>\u201cWhy Richards?\u201d <br><br>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I of all people am saying this, but do you ever stop talking?\u201d <br><br>\u201cNot really.\u201d <br><br>\u201cCan you talk and move?\u201d <br><br>\u201cYeah.\u201d <br><br>\u201cThen do that.\u201d All of a sudden, Peter picked Tony up and started walking down the hall. \u201cSee, this is why we\u2019re great together.\u201d <br><br>Peter laughed, pausing to kiss him again. \u201cGlad you\u2019re enjoying yourself.\u201d</p>",
                "content": "<p><b>Fandom:</b>&nbsp;Marvel</p><p><b>Pairings:</b>&nbsp;Tony Stark/Peter Parker</p><p><b>Warnings:</b>&nbsp;None</p><p><b></b></p><p>Tony stared at- well, nothing but at the place that used to hold the oldest tree on the Mansion&rsquo;s grounds, and he tried desperately not to laugh. Next to him, Peter was wringing his hands, looking between Tony and the newly blank space. <br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry Tony, I don&rsquo;t know what happened. One minute I was walking along with the artifact like I was supposed to, and then I tripped and it- okay there was a flash of purple light and it hit the tree and it vanished. And- and then I went and got you. It only took five minutes, tops, I swear I didn&rsquo;t do this earlier and just forgot to get you.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;You&hellip; tripped,&rdquo; Tony repeated doubtfully. Peter did have a nervous energy about him, but he was always graceful (in body at least). He ran into things sometimes when he and Tony were talking, but it was always preceded by senseless babbling about flowers and food and because he was backing away without looking where he was going. Tony did not believe that Peter just up and tripped while walking all by himself. <br /><br />Peter nodded though, looking painfully earnest like Cap did when he first came out of the ice. <br /><br />&ldquo;Peter, you don&rsquo;t trip.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;I do sometimes!&rdquo; he said defensively. <br /><br />&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re talking to someone maybe, not just while you&rsquo;re walking. Peter, it&rsquo;s okay if you messed up, we all fuck up sometimes. You want to tell me what really happened?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;I did! I&rsquo;m not lying Tony, jesus christ.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Okay, so you were walking and tripped. What did you trip over?&rdquo; <br /><br />He shifted uncomfortably. &ldquo;It might have been a rock, but it might also have been my own foot.&rdquo; <br /><br />Tony frowned, concerned. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been out of it for a couple weeks, is everything alright?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to ask me more about the missing tree?&rdquo; Peter asked, turning back to the spot with obviously fake interest. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite the conundrum, all the roots still look like they&rsquo;re in the ground, and the little plaque is still there, but the actual trunk and everything above it is missing.

It&rsquo;s been weeks, and nothing&rsquo;s changed with you. It hasn&rsquo;t affected your fighting yet, but I don&rsquo;t want to wait for that to happen for you to deal with this&ndash; whatever &lsquo;this&rsquo; might be.\"&nbsp;</p><p>\"It&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo; Peter ruffled his hair as his cheeks pinked. &ldquo;I like someone, and they don&rsquo;t feel the same.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;You sure about that? Cause no offense Peter, you&rsquo;re nothing to sniff at.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Why would I be offended by that?&rdquo; <br /><br />Tony shrugged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m older than you, you might think it was weird. My point is, you&rsquo;re not acting like someone who&rsquo;s been turned down, you&rsquo;re acting like someone who&rsquo;s pining and also doesn&rsquo;t know that they&rsquo;re a catch. You&rsquo;re Spiderman! Come on, who wouldn&rsquo;t want to date you?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;I can think of a few people.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Villains don&rsquo;t count.&rdquo; <br /><br />Peter snorted. &ldquo;Yeah, I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about villains. Quite the opposite.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Have other heroes been talking shit? Tell me who, I&rsquo;ll kick their ass.&rdquo; When Peter started laughing, Tony added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious. Give me a list, Peter, I&rsquo;ll track them down. I don&rsquo;t care if it was Captain America himself, I will do it. Not that I think Steve would do that, mind you, but it&rsquo;s the thought that counts. I&rsquo;ll beat up anyone for you, I will kick my own ass if I need to.&rdquo; <br /><br />That just made Peter laugh harder. &ldquo;Thanks Tony, but that would be sort of self-defeating.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Tony asked, suddenly confused. He wasn&rsquo;t often confused he felt like, but with Peter it was touch and go. This must be what Pepper was talking about when she said she couldn&rsquo;t follow his train of thought. <br /><br />Peter froze. &ldquo;Uh, nothing. Nothing at all. I&rsquo;ll just go call Strange. Or maybe Thor, he has Loki with him right now I think, but asking Loki questions tends to end poorly for me so Thor is the safe option to still get information.&rdquo; With that, he took off for the mansion, walking as fast as he could without running. <br /><br />Tony stared after him, bemused. He wanted to chase after him and figure out what was going on, but Peter could avoid like nobody&rsquo;s business when he put his mind to it. Tony sighed and turned to the blank spot. Might as well look into it while he was here. <br />~~~<br />The next time Tony saw him, he was stuck to the ceiling looking miserable. Tony whistled sharply to get his attention&ndash; calling out to him had been proven not to work in the past. &ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Uh- hi.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;You want to come down here so we can talk?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Not really.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Will you anyways? Please?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why,&rdquo; Peter grumbled. <br /><br />&ldquo;Because I think you&rsquo;re mad at me and I wanted to ask you why so I can figure out how to make it better.&rdquo; Historically, waiting for things to get better didn&rsquo;t end well for him. <br /><br />Peter dropped from the ceiling in a well-practiced flip that looked&ndash; and probably was&ndash; effortless. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong. I&rsquo;m not mad at you, jesus Tony. I&rsquo;ve been mad at you exactly once, and I said it right to your face.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;You did, and I appreciate that because passive aggressive doesn&rsquo;t work for me, but that doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that you&rsquo;re avoiding me.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t even been a day, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s enough time to be considered 'avoiding&rsquo;.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;It is for us,&rdquo; Tony argued. &ldquo;Look Peter, if you don&rsquo;t want me to poke my nose in your love life, I won&rsquo;t, I just need you to say it. Preferably right now so I don&rsquo;t make an ass of myself.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not- oh god.&rdquo; Peter covered his face with his hands. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like that Tony. I- I like you, that&rsquo;s why I can&rsquo;t talk to you about it.&rdquo; <br /><br />Tony&rsquo;s mouth worked but no words came out. &ldquo;Uh Peter? I don&rsquo;t think you like me.&rdquo; <br /><br />Peter peeked through his hands. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t expecting this reaction, I&rsquo;m not prepared,&rdquo; he mumbled to himself. He dropped his hands back to his side. &ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m- what, lying about liking you?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Not lying, just confused.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve liked people before Tony, I think I know how it feels by now.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you do, but- Peter you&rsquo;re young.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;And&hellip;?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not. Even if you did like me, I don&rsquo;t think it would go very well, and besides, you just have a mentor crush.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;No, I had a mentor crush on you when we first met, and then it went away. I&rsquo;ve dated since then, and now here we are.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Yeah. Pretty fucking sure. I&rsquo;ve been trying to ask you out for like a month, and you didn&rsquo;t even notice. It&rsquo;s possible you were blowing me off on purpose but I was really hoping that you just didn&rsquo;t know I was asking.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;I definitely did not know that you were asking me on dates. Wait, is that why you were asking me about flowers the other day? You know you don&rsquo;t have to bring flowers on a date unless you&rsquo;re corny romantic or old fashioned, right? It might be a good move if you were dating Steve, but me,&rdquo; he shrugged. <br /><br />Peter rolled his eyes. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t going to bring you flowers, I was trying to ask if you wanted to go that garden with me. It&rsquo;s spring, everything good is blooming. MJ said it&rsquo;s really pretty, so I thought you might want to go because you like pretty things, especially flowers. You try and pretend like you don&rsquo;t, but I&rsquo;ve seen your art collection.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Pepper collected all that.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Not your fancy art collection with all the big names, I mean the paintings you have hung up around here. You know, the ones with the flowers.&rdquo; <br /><br />Tony just looked at him blankly. <br /><br />&ldquo;You know, the one above the fireplace? It&rsquo;s all red and blue flowers. It&rsquo;s a really good painting Tony, and I asked Pepper once, and she said you bought that one yourself. Do you know the one I&rsquo;m talking about?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;I know which painting you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Then why do you look like that?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;I- uh. I need some time to think about this.&rdquo; <br /><br />Peter nodded, a hand going up to ruffle his hair nervously. &ldquo;Yeah, of course. I&rsquo;ll uh- I&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Sure. Oh and good work with the tree.&rdquo; <br /><br />Peter frowned in confusion. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get it back.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;No, I meant with vanishing it.&rdquo; He shot Peter a grin. &ldquo;I always hated that thing. If you can&rsquo;t get it back, that&rsquo;s the opposite of a problem. Just so you know.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep that in mind,&rdquo; Peter said with a small returning smile before he shuffled away. <br /><br />Tony sighed and went to his room. He didn&rsquo;t spend much time in there, preferring to stick to common areas or the &lsquo;shop when he wanted to think. Today though, he needed a place to think where he wouldn&rsquo;t be interrupted, and the only place he could think of was his bedroom. <br /><br />Peter liked him? That was&hellip; possible, apparently, just highly improbable. Yet here they were. With Peter being so nervous that he tripped while holding an alien artifact. Tony hadn&rsquo;t been lying to him&ndash; he hated that tree. It was the principle of the matter though. It could have had such a worse outcome than a stupid tree that only the city cared about. What if that artifact had been explosive? Peter could have blown himself up, and because he was distracted by Tony of all people. <br /><br />Peter liked him, and he seemed convinced that it was real and not some passing crush. It&rsquo;s not that Tony thought Peter was too young, it&rsquo;s that he thought himself too old. He was forty: a solid fifteen years older than Peter. And&hellip; yeah maybe he&rsquo;d had a few fantasies since Spiderman had become an Avenger, but he was a dirty old man, as long as he kept his hands to himself and felt bad about it, it was fine. Mostly. Sort of. Okay, but the point is that it wasn&rsquo;t fine at all now that there was an actual chance of it happening. <br /><br />Tony&rsquo;s mind was spinning in circles, so he did what he always did in these situations. He called Rhodey. &ldquo;Hey honey bear.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Hey Tones. What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Rhodey asked, voice etched with worry. <br /><br />&ldquo;What makes you think something&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; <br /><br />There was a pause and the sound of a door closing followed by Rhodey sighing. &ldquo;Nothing, I just needed to get out of that meeting. Saying that Iron Man is calling me got me part of the way out, I just needed to sound all concerned to make it all the way. What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;You know Peter?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Your spiderling? Yeah. He alright?&rdquo; <br /><br />Tony flubbed on trying to say that he was fine and settled with, &ldquo;Why did you call him my spiderling?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;You hang out all the time, and- I mean, Tony if you were a cartoon you&rsquo;d have pumping heart eyes every time he walks into the room. Not that that&rsquo;s a bad thing, he&rsquo;s a good guy, and it&rsquo;s nice to see you so in love. Unless he cheated on you or something and that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re calling. If that&rsquo;s what happened, I hate him and we&rsquo;ll go get wasted.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not together,&rdquo; Tony said, feeling numb. Rhodey thought they were together? This was the man that knew everything about him, whether Tony liked it or not, and he thought they were together? Maybe there was more merit to the idea than Tony had let himself think. <br /><br />&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;No.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Oh. Why not? I could&rsquo;ve sworn he looked at you the same way.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Tony said, rubbing at his forehead, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re wrong about that.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Rhodey said again, this time alight with good old fashioned nosiness. <br /><br />&ldquo;He told me that he liked me earlier, and he says it&rsquo;s not a mentor crush.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see where the problem is coming in. This sounds like a perfect little romance.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so much older than him, Rhodey,&rdquo; Tony whined. <br /><br />&ldquo;You act like a twenty three year old at most.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;I have it on good authority that it doesn&rsquo;t matter how old or young you act when it comes to shit like this. He&rsquo;s fifteen years younger than me.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not underage, Tones, he&rsquo;s an adult and a superhero. I have complete faith in Peter&rsquo;s ability to know when what he likes is unacceptable.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;You hardly ever see him.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;I see him enough to know that he loves you,&rdquo; Rhodey said, drawing out 'loves&rsquo; like he was a fourteen year old all of a sudden. <br /><br />&ldquo;You are not helping.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;You say that, but I think that I already did. For my act of goodwill to my idiotic best friend, I now get to tease you about this endlessly.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;No. No no, you only get to tease me if it all turns out okay.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be fine, go kiss his face off.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Rhodey,&rdquo; he groaned. <br /><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be fun! You can peel his mask up just enough to uncover his mouth and have a little superhero make out.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Sounds like you&rsquo;ve thought about this an awful lot. I&rsquo;m kinda worried. What have you been doing while you&rsquo;re giving me hopefully kick ass advice?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s entirely possible that I&rsquo;ve been drinking during this conversation, but you have no proof.&rdquo; <br /><br />Tony snorted. &ldquo;Good example Colonel.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;I learned from the best. Or you. Whatever you want to label yourself right now because I learned day drinking from you.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;I seem to remember a certain someone at MIT taking shots before finals.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Shut up and go kiss Peter. Oh, and thanks for getting me out of that meeting.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;No problem Rhodey pie. Thanks for the help.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Mhm.&rdquo; <br /><br />Tony hung up and took several deep, calming breaths. Rhodey didn&rsquo;t tend to be wrong. Tony just needed to find Peter and talk to him before he chickened out. He scrolled through his contacts and stopped at the little hearts after Peter&rsquo;s name. He remembered adding those, but to see it in the context of the recent developments of Peter actually liking him, it was something else. <br /><br />&ldquo;Tony? Is everything okay? I didn&rsquo;t get an alert, is my badge malfunctioning?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s nothing like that. I was just wondering if you wanted to get dinner together.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Tonight?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Yeah, unless you&rsquo;re busy.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Considering that my friends are out of the country and my only job is being an Avenger, it&rsquo;s pretty safe to say that my schedule is wide open.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;I was trying to give you an out, but fine, be honest if that&rsquo;s what you want,&rdquo; Tony said drily. <br /><br />Peter chuckled. &ldquo;Do I want to know why you&rsquo;re asking me to dinner? Should I use my waterproof makeup?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been spending time with Deadpool haven&rsquo;t you.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Maybe. He&rsquo;s entertaining.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Extremely, but as a rule, when you start talking like him, you need some space.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in South America right now. I think. Point is, he&rsquo;s not on this continent, so I have space from him whether or not I want it. Which I don&rsquo;t, really. He tends to get in trouble when he spends too long away.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed that. And it&rsquo;s you specifically, not just superheroes in general.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Yeah, he really likes Spiderman. I don&rsquo;t know why.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Probably because you&rsquo;re incredible.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Yeah I- wait what?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;What what?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Did you just call me incredible?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;You know I like you, this isn&rsquo;t a surprise.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Well yeah, you like me fine, but complimenting me after I tell you that I like you is&hellip; weird.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Weird if I didn&rsquo;t ask you on a date.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;What did you think dinner tonight was?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;A nice big public outing where you tell me thanks but no thanks so that I can&rsquo;t get upset.&rdquo; <br /><br />Tony made a face, starting to think that he should have had this conversation face to face. &ldquo;Peter, who have you been dating? Or trying to date but it turns out that they&rsquo;re assholes.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying that that&rsquo;s happened to me, but it is a possibility.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a possibility with me, ever. Especially not with you.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Why Mister Stark that was practically romantic.&rdquo; <br /><br />Tony could picture the way Peter was blushing even as he tried to act coy. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t count on it happening again.&rdquo; <br /><br />Peter hummed, clearly not convinced. &ldquo;You saying that or you being romantic?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Both.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you,&rdquo; Peter said mildly. &ldquo;So where are we going?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;You like Italian?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Of course I do, I&rsquo;m dating you aren&rsquo;t I? And just so you know, eating Italian on a date automatically makes it romantic. Haven&rsquo;t you seen Lady and the Tramp?&rdquo; <br /><br />Tony just laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you at seven.&rdquo; <br /><br />~~~<br /><br />Tony gasped as his back hit the wall, fisting his hands in Peter&rsquo;s shirt as they kissed. <br /><br />&ldquo;Not too fast?&rdquo; Peter asked, even as he licked and kissed his way down to the base of Tony&rsquo;s neck to suck a hickey. Tony usually wasn&rsquo;t into that because his dates were more like hookups and he didn&rsquo;t want any marks from them, but this was Peter. He tilted his neck to the side to give him more room, and Peter took it gratefully, changing the angle and sucking harder to make Tony moan. <br /><br />&ldquo;According to Rhodey-&rdquo; Tony gasped &ldquo;-this is a long time coming.&rdquo; <br /><br />Peter hummed. &ldquo;Rhodey&rsquo;s a smart man. You gonna let me take you to your room?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem like you&rsquo;re letting me do anything here.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;You complaining?&rdquo; <br /><br />Tony rolled his hips against Peter&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Definitely not.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t answer the question.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Peter if you don&rsquo;t take me to bed, I&rsquo;m going to turn rogue and blame it on Richards.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Why Richards?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe I of all people am saying this, but do you ever stop talking?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Not really.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Can you talk and move?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Then do that.&rdquo; All of a sudden, Peter picked Tony up and started walking down the hall. &ldquo;See, this is why we&rsquo;re great together.&rdquo; <br /><br />Peter laughed, pausing to kiss him again. &ldquo;Glad you&rsquo;re enjoying yourself.&rdquo;</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p><b>Fandom:</b>&nbsp;Marvel</p>\n<p><b>Pairings:</b>&nbsp;Tony Stark/Peter Parker</p>\n<p><b>Warnings:</b>&nbsp;None</p>\n<p><b></b></p>\n<p>Tony stared at- well, nothing but at the place that used to hold the oldest tree on the Mansion&rsquo;s grounds, and he tried desperately not to laugh. Next to him, Peter was wringing his hands, looking between Tony and the newly blank space. <br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry Tony, I don&rsquo;t know what happened. One minute I was walking along with the artifact like I was supposed to, and then I tripped and it- okay there was a flash of purple light and it hit the tree and it vanished. And- and then I went and got you. It only took five minutes, tops, I swear I didn&rsquo;t do this earlier and just forgot to get you.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;You&hellip; tripped,&rdquo; Tony repeated doubtfully. Peter did have a nervous energy about him, but he was always graceful (in body at least). He ran into things sometimes when he and Tony were talking, but it was always preceded by senseless babbling about flowers and food and because he was backing away without looking where he was going. Tony did not believe that Peter just up and tripped while walking all by himself. <br /><br />Peter nodded though, looking painfully earnest like Cap did when he first came out of the ice. <br /><br />&ldquo;Peter, you don&rsquo;t trip.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;I do sometimes!&rdquo; he said defensively. <br /><br />&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re talking to someone maybe, not just while you&rsquo;re walking. Peter, it&rsquo;s okay if you messed up, we all fuck up sometimes. You want to tell me what really happened?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;I did! I&rsquo;m not lying Tony, jesus christ.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Okay, so you were walking and tripped. What did you trip over?&rdquo; <br /><br />He shifted uncomfortably. &ldquo;It might have been a rock, but it might also have been my own foot.&rdquo; <br /><br />Tony frowned, concerned. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been out of it for a couple weeks, is everything alright?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to ask me more about the missing tree?&rdquo; Peter asked, turning back to the spot with obviously fake interest. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite the conundrum, all the roots still look like they&rsquo;re in the ground, and the little plaque is still there, but the actual trunk and everything above it is missing. Strange indeed. And I did walk where it used to be to make sure it wasn&rsquo;t invisible or cloaked or something.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Good to know that it&rsquo;s missing and not hiding in plain sight,&rdquo; Tony agreed. &ldquo;What are you thinking about that&rsquo;s got you like this?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not talk about it,&rdquo; Peter said quietly, not looking at him. <br /><br />&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to talk to me if you don&rsquo;t want to, but I think you need to talk to someone. It&rsquo;s been weeks, and nothing&rsquo;s changed with you. It hasn&rsquo;t affected your fighting yet, but I don&rsquo;t want to wait for that to happen for you to deal with this&ndash; whatever &lsquo;this&rsquo; might be.\"&nbsp;</p>\n</p>",

On a bad day, when he was tossed to the ground during training or felt like he didn\u2019t do enough during patrol, the science was something that was there for him to work with, either in the lab at the Avengers compound or with homework. He preferred the former. </p><p>The lab was everything he needed, and more. It had the chemicals for his web fluid, different elements to experiment with, and so many high-tech computers, he almost had an aneurysm the first time it was shown to him. Peter spent most of his time at the compond in that lab, outside of training and \u2018bonding\u2019 with the team. </p><p>Of course, Peter often wasn\u2019t the only person in the room most of the time. Mr. Stark worked in there, along with Dr. Banner and a couple other SHIELD scientists. There was one other girl; Peter never spoke to her, or really acknowledged her existence, but she was there, working on something. </p><p>It was after a particularly rough training session that the two were alone in the lab - a rarity, as no one was ever truly alone in the compound. The girl was bent over her workstation, muttering under her breath, tilting her head at different angles to see her project. Peter didn\u2019t understand what she was saying or what she was working on, so he buried himself in his own massive pile of work. </p><p>That is, until she cursed out loud. </p><p>\u201cAh, fuck,\u201d she hissed, flapping her hand in the air.

He missed what the little black and red box actually did, but he somehow knew that it would be cool. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d [Y/N] shouted, sliding into the living area like she owned the place, which, technically, she did, but that wasn\u2019t the point. Peter noticed that she had the same command over the room as her father always had. \u201cI made something for you!\u201d</p><p>Tony was in the kitchen, eyebrows furrowed. \u201cWhy are you two together? Do you know his name? What\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChill, Tony,\u201d Natasha laughed. \u201cThey probably just met.\u201d</p><p>Peter pointed at the redhead assassin. \u201cExactly. I\u2019m not associated with this girl at all. [Y/N] Stark? I don\u2019t know her.\u201d</p><p>[Y/N] laughed, punching Peter in the arm. To his surprise, it actually stung quite a bit. Not that he thought she was weak, but he didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be <i>that</i> strong. \u201cHere,\u201d she handed the package to her father, who looked at the tissue box-sized thing with curiosity. </p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Tony asked, and Peter heard genuine curiosity in his voice, something that was rare when it cane to asking about certain things within the team. \u201cIt looks like a tissue box.\u201d</p><p>[Y/N] reached forward and tapped a rhythm on the top, and the red lined started to glow. \u201cSet it on the counter.\u201d</p><p>Tony did as he was told, and the box unfolded. Peter moved closer so he could see the invention, and he was blown away by the intricacy of the robot. Red and gold pinstriped the otherwise black bot, the entire thing only about a foot and a half tall. It looked somewhat like a transformer, but less colorful. </p><p>\u201c- it\u2019s adaptive, too! It notices your patterns and kinda develops a plan to keep you on track. \u201c [Y/N] was in the middle of explaining the operation of the robot to her father, who looked absolutely shell-shocked that his daughter created that thing for him. </p><p>\u201cHow long did this take you?\u201d Tony asked, leaning down to get a closer look at it. </p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI dunno, about three weeks to get the programming right, and two and a half to model and build it? Peter helped me get the last couple wires in place today.\u201d</p><p>Tony stood up straight, glancing at the boy in question, who started fidgeting when his name was mentioned. \u201cAh. I see.\u201d He crossed the room quickly, standing over Peter. \u201cWhat are your intentions with my daughter, Mr. Parker?\u201d</p><p>Peter fishtailed for an answer, stammering over his words. \u201cNo it\u2019s not- I don\u2019t- I mean, we just\u2026 we just met? That\u2019s kinda weird?\u201d</p><p>Tony kept his straight face for a few moments, and then burst out laughing. \u201cOh boy, you should\u2019ve seen your face! Did you see his face?\u201d</p><p>[Y/N] was laughing too, her arms wrapped around her stomach, doubled over in silent laughter. She nodded hysterically. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m joking, kid.\u201d Tony slapped a hand down on Peter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cBut seriously, she\u2019s a good kid. Listen to her. Maybe you\u2019ll learn something cool.\u201d</p><p>Peter smiled at his mentor, and nodded. \u201cDuly noted.\u201d</p></p>",

However, I was feeling it, and I hope <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAXrEaWvSfH23IXgpb802A\">@softboy-holland</a> enjoys it too! (Hi Cori!!! I love your writing!!). I think this also might be the longest thing I&rsquo;ve written here? Idk. Anyways, feel free to send requests!!</p><p><a href=\"https://flannelparkers.tumblr.com/post/174449205900/rorys-masterlist\">Masterlist</a></p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>If there was one thing Peter loved more than being Spider-Man, it was chemistry. On a bad day, when he was tossed to the ground during training or felt like he didn&rsquo;t do enough during patrol, the science was something that was there for him to work with, either in the lab at the Avengers compound or with homework. He preferred the former. </p><p>The lab was everything he needed, and more. It had the chemicals for his web fluid, different elements to experiment with, and so many high-tech computers, he almost had an aneurysm the first time it was shown to him. Peter spent most of his time at the compond in that lab, outside of training and &lsquo;bonding&rsquo; with the team. </p><p>Of course, Peter often wasn&rsquo;t the only person in the room most of the time. Mr. Stark worked in there, along with Dr. Banner and a couple other SHIELD scientists. There was one other girl; Peter never spoke to her, or really acknowledged her existence, but she was there, working on something. </p><p>It was after a particularly rough training session that the two were alone in the lab - a rarity, as no one was ever truly alone in the compound. The girl was bent over her workstation, muttering under her breath, tilting her head at different angles to see her project. Peter didn&rsquo;t understand what she was saying or what she was working on, so he buried himself in his own massive pile of work. </p><p>That is, until she cursed out loud. </p><p>&ldquo;Ah, fuck,&rdquo; she hissed, flapping her hand in the air. She looked at Peter&rsquo;s bewildered expression and motioned over. &ldquo;Can you help me with something real fast?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nodded, not wanting to invoke the wrath of this unnamed stranger. &ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p><p>He made his way to her, weaving his way around different tables and stray computers. She took Peter&rsquo;s hand and guided it to two wires, placing them in such a position that they were barely touching but still conducting. &ldquo;Hold that right&hellip; there&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>She drifted off, fiddling with something inside the contraption, a miniature screwdriver in her mouth. She glanced up at Peter while her nimble fingers danced. &ldquo;So, who are you and why are you always around here?&rdquo; </p><p>Peter processed her words, and thought about a good answer, one that would tell this girl who he was, without telling her <i>who</i> he was. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Peter, I&rsquo;m an intern for Mr. Stark. Who are you?&rdquo;</p><p>She had pulled the screwdriver out of her nouth while Peter talked, and she looked up at him, rolling her eyes. &ldquo;An intern that complains about being sore all the time and fiddles in the lab the other half of the time? Sure.&rdquo; She pulled the wires from Peter&rsquo;s hand, gently intertwining the copper and tucking it into the box. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m [Y/N].&rdquo;</p><p>Peter blanched, not prepared for his unnamed, unofficial &lsquo;lab partner&rsquo; to be Tony Stark&rsquo;s <i>daughter</i>. &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p><p>She laughed, and it all clicked. The way she moved, the way she fiddled with the thing she was building, the way she tucked her hair behind her ear-</p><p>Okay, that last one wasn&rsquo;t relevant to Mr. Stark, but Peter couldn&rsquo;t deny that [Y/N] was pretty. </p><p>Aunt May hadn&rsquo;t raised no liar. </p><p>&ldquo;And&hellip; done!&rdquo; She announced, raising her hands in the air and jumping up from her seat. She lunged at Peter and trapped him in a hug, throwing him off guard. He flailed his arms awkwardly until he realized that [Y/N] Stark was hugging him, and then hugged her back, lifting her body in the air. &ldquo;Thank you for your help, Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No problem,&rdquo; Peter said, setting her down. &ldquo;What exactly did you make?&rdquo;</p><p>[Y/N]&rsquo;s eyes lit up, beginning to talk animatedly about her invention. &ldquo;Okay, so lately my dad has been having trouble lately remembering to eat and shower and go to bed and stuff, so I built him this little robot-type alarm thingie that has FRIDAY built into it, so he can keep it with him, and FRIDAY&rsquo;ll remind him to do that stuff.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter had zoned out after &lsquo;my dad&rsquo;, watching [Y/N]&rsquo;s enthusiasm and compassion for her father completely take over. Peter had no doubt in his mind that Tony Stark had raised the girl in front of him. Dark hair, wild eyes, nimble fingers, and a gift for engineering - she was like a Tony horcrux, if those were real. A little piece of Tony&rsquo;s soul resided in her. </p><p>&ldquo;-I&rsquo;m gonna give it to him now, actually. Wanna come with?&rdquo; Peter zoned back in just in time to hear her question, and he nodded. He missed what the little black and red box actually did, but he somehow knew that it would be cool. </p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Dad!&rdquo; [Y/N] shouted, sliding into the living area like she owned the place, which, technically, she did, but that wasn&rsquo;t the point.

You were about to start pulling out your hair. You set down your coffee, still longing for your first taste. You couldn\u2019t handle this without caffeine. You reluctantly left the kitchen and dragged your feet through the living room.<br/></p><p>With dread, you opened the door, feigning surprise as Shuri stood grinning beside your mother. The latter looked less than impressed.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cMom!\u201d You exclaimed, a little to over the top. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter question; what are you<i> still</i> doing here?\u201d She quorked her head like a bird of prey, bearing down on you.</p><p>\u201cWe just talked&hellip;last week. I told you I was going to stay a bit longer.\u201d You peeked at Shuri who was a bit too amused by the whole scene.</p><p>\u201cYes, but do you not recall the drunken call you made to me only days ago at midnight? I suspect it was even later here.\u201d She turned her head to Shuri who shrunk away at her piercing gaze, \u201cYou and this one! Telling me you wanted me to come to Wakanda. A wonderful invitation but less so when I\u2019m trying to sleep and still have half a house full of your stuff while you cavort around in Africa!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, mom,\u201d You mumbled, \u201cI missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you try that,\u201d She hitched the bag up on her shoulder. \u201cNow, are you going to invite me in or will you once more leave your mother all by her lonesome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, come in,\u201d You said and moved out of her path. Shuri followed and you stopped her before she could get past the door mat, \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI totally forgot I sent her the ticket until this morning,\u201d She whispered, failing to conceal another smirk, \u201cBut it is kinda funny. She\u2019s much more terrifying than my mother&hellip;and mine is a queen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d You turned away from her, your mother looking around the front room, \u201cHere, let me take your bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d She let you take her heavy tote and the suitcase she dragged in her other hand, \u201cThis is a rather cute home&hellip;where\u2019s that farmer you were working for? The one with the hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBucky?\u201d Shuri chuckled, \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s hiding somewhere. Maybe with his goats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiet,\u201d You hissed over your shoulder as you dragged your mother\u2019s bags just inside your bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cDid someone say my name?\u201d Bucky entered with even less chill than you. To your relief, he was dressed and his hair was brushed. If it wasn\u2019t for the strained look on his face, he would\u2019ve been perfect. \u201cI\u2019m Bucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNora,\u201d Your mother answered as she neared him, taking his hand cordially, \u201cI hadn\u2019t noticed the arm thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d You said mortified, \u201cNot the way to say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Bucky rescinded his hand and shrugged, though he looked embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cWhat? He\u2019s still quite a figure without it,\u201d She was almost leering at him, \u201cEven better looking in person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease stop,\u201d You groaned. Bucky\u2019s cheeks were glowing.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear, if I was still your age, I\u2019d find myself a nice young goat herder myself,\u201d She looked at you over her shoulder and winked, \u201cEspecially if he looked like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMommmmmmmmm,\u201d You almost whined. You, a grown woman, sounded like a child, \u201cWhat do I have to do to get you to stop? I\u2019m sorry, okay? So very sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not mad,\u201d She whisked around, facing you with a smile, \u201cI only missed my daughter who never calls me, even when she\u2019s a world away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d You hung your head darkly, \u201cI did mean to call more but&hellip;it\u2019s been busy around here. Um, we had a baby goat. Not, uh, us, but Charlotte did. I mean, one of the goats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear, please do bite your tongue before it falls out of your mouth,\u201d She laughed, \u201cI\u2019ll have some coffee before I meet these goats of yours. And maybe something to eat.\u201d</p><hr><p>You placed your cup of coffee before your mom and doled out a plate of bacon and eggs for her. Shuri sat smugly at the island, openly enjoying your discomfort, and Bucky half hid in the doorway, picking at the frame with interest. He wasn\u2019t the greatest back up.</p><p>\u201cUm\u2026\u201d You squinted at him for a moment, cursing his cowardice at such a time, \u201cI\u2019m going to feed the goats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll do it!\u201d Bucky rang, relishing the escape.</p><p>\u201cYou stay here,\u201d You pointed at him, \u201cHave some breakfast&hellip;I\u2019m sure my mom has lots of questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d You mom swallowed a piece of egg, \u201cFirst of all, why have you stolen my daughter from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhhh,\u201d His mouth fell open and his eyes widened in panic, \u201cI didn\u2019t&ndash;I&ndash;She chose&ndash;You can have her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, do calm down,\u201d She laughed, \u201cI\u2019m only joking.\u201d</p><p>You shook your head and quickly fled out the door before she could turn her sights on you. You took your time scattering the feed, picking up Wilbur as you often did to cradle him. He was so cute and much better company than your mother. </p><p>A shadow filled the barn door and Shuri entered. She walked with a nonchalance which irked you. You were certain she had hidden your drunken phone call from you, knowing you couldn\u2019t recall much about that night. She must have known for days that your mother was coming and she had not the grace to tell you.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d She neared and cooed at Wilbur, stroking his small head, \u201cThis is the new goat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut the crap, Shuri,\u201d You pulled away and set Wilbur on his small hooves, \u201cWhy would you do this to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I bring your mother to visit? Most people would see that as a favour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean. You could\u2019ve warned me, at least,\u201d You sighed, \u201cOr Bucky&hellip;he\u2019s not the greatest with new people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he seemed to take to you quite easily so I didn\u2019t think your mother would fare much worse,\u201d She grinned, \u201cIt\u2019s odd to think that he\u2019s older than her, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, actually,\u201d You frowned, \u201cIt is. Thank you, Shuri, again for your wise insight.\u201d</p><p>You turned to watch the goats as they ate but Oscar had disappeared among the group. A moment ago, he had been in the centre of the horde. That one was always getting into trouble and reminded you of the girl at your shoulder. </p><p>You crossed your arms as you thought about how quickly the morning had soured. You had slept in a joyful rapture, awoken to a dreamlike sequence, but it had all crumbled quickly. Now reality was setting in and the day hadn\u2019t even begun. Maybe, Bucky was too old for you; too fractured. Maybe you were too naive.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, Y/N,\u201d Shuri punched your shoulder, breaking you from your thoughts, \u201cI knew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You narrowed your eyes as her smirk turned sinister.</p><p>\u201cYou and Goat Boy&hellip;something happened last night, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No?\u201d You said without conviction.</p><p>\u201cIt did!\u201d She nearly squealed, \u201cI saw you after your dance but I thought you were too scared and, oh, please tell me everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShuri, nothing happened,\u201d You uncrossed your arms and passed her, heading for the door. Your mother was preferable to the princess at this point.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an awful liar,\u201d She sang from behind you, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll just ask the man myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShuri!\u201d You turned on her, your finger in her face, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare, okay? It was just a kiss and it is none of your business. Or anyone else\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, girl,\u201d She chuckled, \u201cTook you long enough&hellip;just a kiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, goddamn,\u201d You rolled your eyes.</p><p>\u201cMy lips are sealed,\u201d She set her hand on her heart, \u201cOn my honour as a princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm,\u201d You groaned darkly, \u201cI trust that even less.\u201d</p>",

I told you I was going to stay a bit longer.\u201d You peeked at Shuri who was a bit too amused by the whole scene.</p><p>\u201cYes, but do you not recall the drunken call you made to me only days ago at midnight? I suspect it was even later here.\u201d She turned her head to Shuri who shrunk away at her piercing gaze, \u201cYou and this one! Telling me you wanted me to come to Wakanda. A wonderful invitation but less so when I\u2019m trying to sleep and still have half a house full of your stuff while you cavort around in Africa!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, mom,\u201d You mumbled, \u201cI missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you try that,\u201d She hitched the bag up on her shoulder. \u201cNow, are you going to invite me in or will you once more leave your mother all by her lonesome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, come in,\u201d You said and moved out of her path. Shuri followed and you stopped her before she could get past the door mat, \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI totally forgot I sent her the ticket until this morning,\u201d She whispered, failing to conceal another smirk, \u201cBut it is kinda funny. She\u2019s much more terrifying than my mother\u2026and mine is a queen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d You turned away from her, your mother looking around the front room, \u201cHere, let me take your bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d She let you take her heavy tote and the suitcase she dragged in her other hand, \u201cThis is a rather cute home\u2026where\u2019s that farmer you were working for? The one with the hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBucky?\u201d Shuri chuckled, \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s hiding somewhere. Maybe with his goats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiet,\u201d You hissed over your shoulder as you dragged your mother\u2019s bags just inside your bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cDid someone say my name?\u201d Bucky entered with even less chill than you. To your relief, he was dressed and his hair was brushed. If it wasn\u2019t for the strained look on his face, he would\u2019ve been perfect. \u201cI\u2019m Bucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNora,\u201d Your mother answered as she neared him, taking his hand cordially, \u201cI hadn\u2019t noticed the arm thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d You said mortified, \u201cNot the way to say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Bucky rescinded his hand and shrugged, though he looked embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cWhat? He\u2019s still quite a figure without it,\u201d She was almost leering at him, \u201cEven better looking in person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease stop,\u201d You groaned. Bucky\u2019s cheeks were glowing.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear, if I was still your age, I\u2019d find myself a nice young goat herder myself,\u201d She looked at you over her shoulder and winked, \u201cEspecially if he looked like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMommmmmmmmm,\u201d You almost whined. You, a grown woman, sounded like a child, \u201cWhat do I have to do to get you to stop? I\u2019m sorry, okay? So very sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not mad,\u201d She whisked around, facing you with a smile, \u201cI only missed my daughter who never calls me, even when she\u2019s a world away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d You hung your head darkly, \u201cI did mean to call more but\u2026it\u2019s been busy around here. Um, we had a baby goat. Not, uh, us, but Charlotte did. I mean, one of the goats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear, please do bite your tongue before it falls out of your mouth,\u201d She laughed, \u201cI\u2019ll have some coffee before I meet these goats of yours. And maybe something to eat.\u201d</p><hr><p>You placed your cup of coffee before your mom and doled out a plate of bacon and eggs for her. Shuri sat smugly at the island, openly enjoying your discomfort, and Bucky half hid in the doorway, picking at the frame with interest. He wasn\u2019t the greatest back up.</p><p>\u201cUm\u2026\u201d You squinted at him for a moment, cursing his cowardice at such a time, \u201cI\u2019m going to feed the goats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll do it!\u201d Bucky rang, relishing the escape.</p><p>\u201cYou stay here,\u201d You pointed at him, \u201cHave some breakfast\u2026I\u2019m sure my mom has lots of questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d You mom swallowed a piece of egg, \u201cFirst of all, why have you stolen my daughter from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhhh,\u201d His mouth fell open and his eyes widened in panic, \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2013I\u2013She chose\u2013You can have her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, do calm down,\u201d She laughed, \u201cI\u2019m only joking.\u201d</p><p>You shook your head and quickly fled out the door before she could turn her sights on you. You took your time scattering the feed, picking up Wilbur as you often did to cradle him. He was so cute and much better company than your mother. </p><p>A shadow filled the barn door and Shuri entered. She walked with a nonchalance which irked you. You were certain she had hidden your drunken phone call from you, knowing you couldn\u2019t recall much about that night. She must have known for days that your mother was coming and she had not the grace to tell you.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d She neared and cooed at Wilbur, stroking his small head, \u201cThis is the new goat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut the crap, Shuri,\u201d You pulled away and set Wilbur on his small hooves, \u201cWhy would you do this to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I bring your mother to visit? Most people would see that as a favour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean. You could\u2019ve warned me, at least,\u201d You sighed, \u201cOr Bucky\u2026he\u2019s not the greatest with new people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he seemed to take to you quite easily so I didn\u2019t think your mother would fare much worse,\u201d She grinned, \u201cIt\u2019s odd to think that he\u2019s older than her, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, actually,\u201d You frowned, \u201cIt is. Thank you, Shuri, again for your wise insight.\u201d</p><p>You turned to watch the goats as they ate but Oscar had disappeared among the group. A moment ago, he had been in the centre of the horde. That one was always getting into trouble and reminded you of the girl at your shoulder. </p><p>You crossed your arms as you thought about how quickly the morning had soured. You had slept in a joyful rapture, awoken to a dreamlike sequence, but it had all crumbled quickly. Now reality was setting in and the day hadn\u2019t even begun. Maybe, Bucky was too old for you; too fractured. Maybe you were too naive.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, Y/N,\u201d Shuri punched your shoulder, breaking you from your thoughts, \u201cI knew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You narrowed your eyes as her smirk turned sinister.</p><p>\u201cYou and Goat Boy\u2026something happened last night, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No?\u201d You said without conviction.</p><p>\u201cIt did!\u201d She nearly squealed, \u201cI saw you after your dance but I thought you were too scared and, oh, please tell me everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShuri, nothing happened,\u201d You uncrossed your arms and passed her, heading for the door. Your mother was preferable to the princess at this point.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an awful liar,\u201d She sang from behind you, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll just ask the man myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShuri!\u201d You turned on her, your finger in her face, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare, okay? It was just a kiss and it is none of your business. Or anyone else\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, girl,\u201d She chuckled, \u201cTook you long enough\u2026just a kiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, goddamn,\u201d You rolled your eyes.</p><p>\u201cMy lips are sealed,\u201d She set her hand on her heart, \u201cOn my honour as a princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm,\u201d You groaned darkly, \u201cI trust that even less.\u201d</p>",

Bucky\u2019s cheeks were glowing.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear, if I was still your age, I\u2019d find myself a nice young goat herder myself,\u201d She looked at you over her shoulder and winked, \u201cEspecially if he looked like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMommmmmmmmm,\u201d You almost whined. You, a grown woman, sounded like a child, \u201cWhat do I have to do to get you to stop? I\u2019m sorry, okay? So very sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not mad,\u201d She whisked around, facing you with a smile, \u201cI only missed my daughter who never calls me, even when she\u2019s a world away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d You hung your head darkly, \u201cI did mean to call more but\u2026it\u2019s been busy around here. Um, we had a baby goat. Not, uh, us, but Charlotte did. I mean, one of the goats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear, please do bite your tongue before it falls out of your mouth,\u201d She laughed, \u201cI\u2019ll have some coffee before I meet these goats of yours. And maybe something to eat.\u201d</p><hr><p>You placed your cup of coffee before your mom and doled out a plate of bacon and eggs for her. Shuri sat smugly at the island, openly enjoying your discomfort, and Bucky half hid in the doorway, picking at the frame with interest. He wasn\u2019t the greatest back up.</p><p>\u201cUm\u2026\u201d You squinted at him for a moment, cursing his cowardice at such a time, \u201cI\u2019m going to feed the goats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll do it!\u201d Bucky rang, relishing the escape.</p><p>\u201cYou stay here,\u201d You pointed at him, \u201cHave some breakfast\u2026I\u2019m sure my mom has lots of questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d You mom swallowed a piece of egg, \u201cFirst of all, why have you stolen my daughter from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhhh,\u201d His mouth fell open and his eyes widened in panic, \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2013I\u2013She chose\u2013You can have her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, do calm down,\u201d She laughed, \u201cI\u2019m only joking.\u201d</p><p>You shook your head and quickly fled out the door before she could turn her sights on you. You took your time scattering the feed, picking up Wilbur as you often did to cradle him. He was so cute and much better company than your mother. </p><p>A shadow filled the barn door and Shuri entered. She walked with a nonchalance which irked you. You were certain she had hidden your drunken phone call from you, knowing you couldn\u2019t recall much about that night. She must have known for days that your mother was coming and she had not the grace to tell you.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d She neared and cooed at Wilbur, stroking his small head, \u201cThis is the new goat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut the crap, Shuri,\u201d You pulled away and set Wilbur on his small hooves, \u201cWhy would you do this to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I bring your mother to visit? Most people would see that as a favour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean. You could\u2019ve warned me, at least,\u201d You sighed, \u201cOr Bucky\u2026he\u2019s not the greatest with new people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he seemed to take to you quite easily so I didn\u2019t think your mother would fare much worse,\u201d She grinned, \u201cIt\u2019s odd to think that he\u2019s older than her, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, actually,\u201d You frowned, \u201cIt is. Thank you, Shuri, again for your wise insight.\u201d</p><p>You turned to watch the goats as they ate but Oscar had disappeared among the group. A moment ago, he had been in the centre of the horde. That one was always getting into trouble and reminded you of the girl at your shoulder. </p><p>You crossed your arms as you thought about how quickly the morning had soured. You had slept in a joyful rapture, awoken to a dreamlike sequence, but it had all crumbled quickly. Now reality was setting in and the day hadn\u2019t even begun. Maybe, Bucky was too old for you; too fractured. Maybe you were too naive.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, Y/N,\u201d Shuri punched your shoulder, breaking you from your thoughts, \u201cI knew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You narrowed your eyes as her smirk turned sinister.</p><p>\u201cYou and Goat Boy\u2026something happened last night, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No?\u201d You said without conviction.</p><p>\u201cIt did!\u201d She nearly squealed, \u201cI saw you after your dance but I thought you were too scared and, oh, please tell me everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShuri, nothing happened,\u201d You uncrossed your arms and passed her, heading for the door. Your mother was preferable to the princess at this point.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an awful liar,\u201d She sang from behind you, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll just ask the man myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShuri!\u201d You turned on her, your finger in her face, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare, okay? It was just a kiss and it is none of your business. Or anyone else\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, girl,\u201d She chuckled, \u201cTook you long enough\u2026just a kiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, goddamn,\u201d You rolled your eyes.</p><p>\u201cMy lips are sealed,\u201d She set her hand on her heart, \u201cOn my honour as a princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm,\u201d You groaned darkly, \u201cI trust that even less.\u201d</p>",

You were about to start pulling out your hair. You set down your coffee, still longing for your first taste. You couldn&rsquo;t handle this without caffeine. You reluctantly left the kitchen and dragged your feet through the living room.<br /></p><p>With dread, you opened the door, feigning surprise as Shuri stood grinning beside your mother. The latter looked less than impressed.</p><p>&ldquo;Mom!&rdquo; You exclaimed, a little to over the top. &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Better question; what are you<i> still</i> doing here?&rdquo; She quorked her head like a bird of prey, bearing down on you.</p><p>&ldquo;We just talked&hellip;last week. I told you I was going to stay a bit longer.&rdquo; You peeked at Shuri who was a bit too amused by the whole scene.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but do you not recall the drunken call you made to me only days ago at midnight? I suspect it was even later here.&rdquo; She turned her head to Shuri who shrunk away at her piercing gaze, &ldquo;You and this one! Telling me you wanted me to come to Wakanda. A wonderful invitation but less so when I&rsquo;m trying to sleep and still have half a house full of your stuff while you cavort around in Africa!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too, mom,&rdquo; You mumbled, &ldquo;I missed you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you try that,&rdquo; She hitched the bag up on her shoulder. &ldquo;Now, are you going to invite me in or will you once more leave your mother all by her lonesome?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, come in,&rdquo; You said and moved out of her path. Shuri followed and you stopped her before she could get past the door mat, &ldquo;What the fuck?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I totally forgot I sent her the ticket until this morning,&rdquo; She whispered, failing to conceal another smirk, &ldquo;But it is kinda funny. She&rsquo;s much more terrifying than my mother&hellip;and mine is a queen!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; You turned away from her, your mother looking around the front room, &ldquo;Here, let me take your bag.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; She let you take her heavy tote and the suitcase she dragged in her other hand, &ldquo;This is a rather cute home&hellip;where&rsquo;s that farmer you were working for? The one with the hair?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bucky?&rdquo; Shuri chuckled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s hiding somewhere. Maybe with his goats.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Quiet,&rdquo; You hissed over your shoulder as you dragged your mother&rsquo;s bags just inside your bedroom door.</p><p>&ldquo;Did someone say my name?&rdquo; Bucky entered with even less chill than you. To your relief, he was dressed and his hair was brushed. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the strained look on his face, he would&rsquo;ve been perfect. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Bucky.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nora,&rdquo; Your mother answered as she neared him, taking his hand cordially, &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t noticed the arm thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mom,&rdquo; You said mortified, &ldquo;Not the way to say that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; Bucky rescinded his hand and shrugged, though he looked embarrassed.</p><p>&ldquo;What?
