Peter bit his lip nervously.</p><p>\u201cKaren, call Mister Stark.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cCalling Mister Stark.\u201d</p><p>The beeping of the phone ringing filled the empty silence around you, and, for once, you couldn\u2019t be mad at Peter for calling Tony. Usually, if ever you accompanied Peter on one of his patrols and you winded up getting injured, you\u2019d beg for him not to call for fear of the man never letting you out again. Nevertheless, you figured now was as good a time as any to let him know how badly you\u2019d messed up your ankle.</p><p><i>\u201cPete. Everything alright?</i>\u201d You looked up as Tony\u2019s voice sounded from Peter\u2019s suit.

I just busted up my ankle, is all.\u201d<br/></p><p>The both of you heard a dry chuckle on the other end of the phone and what sounded like a bit of shuffling round.\u00a0<i>\u201c\u2019Is all\u2019,\u201d</i> he replied, sarcasm dripping from his voice.\u00a0<i>\u201cHow\u2019d you manage that?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cIt was my fault,\u201d Peter piped up.\u00a0\u201cI told her she could make the jump from one building to the other, but she almost fell and I had to swing down to catch her\u2026\u201d He winced at Tony\u2019s sigh.<br/></p><p><i>\u201cStay on the </i>ground<i>, kids. Isn\u2019t that what I said?\u201d</i><br/></p><p>Peter moved to assure him.\u00a0\u201cNo, no, I just said-\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s your fault, yeah, I know. Except, </i>I\u2019m <i>saying the blame lies with the </i>both <i>of you. Tell me, Y/N, how\u2019d you get on the roof in the first place? I\u2019m guessing Peter forced you up there, right?\u201d</i><br/></p><p>You rolled your eyes.\u00a0\u201cTony, I\u2019m in <i>pain</i>, here.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cYeah, and I\u2019m in the car and on my way. But, you\u2019re getting it once I find you. You can\u2019t endanger your life like this.\u201d </i>You could hear the scolding tone in his voice as both you and Peter glanced at each other, wincing.\u00a0<i>\u201cPeter, have you got something to wrap her ankle with?\u201d</i></p><p>Peter stood to his feet, shuffling inside a pocket in his suit you didn\u2019t even know he had and pulling out a roll of bandages. You rose an eyebrow.\u00a0\u201cWhat the hell, Pete?\u201d</p><p>Your best friend gave you a look.\u00a0\u201cOh, come <i>on</i>, Y/N; this isn\u2019t the first time something like this has happened. I come prepared on every patrol.\u201d He knelt back down next to you and sighed.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve got bandages, Tony.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cRight, okay. You know how to wrap her ankle with it?\u201d</i><br/></p><p>\u201cNo, but I can try.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Pe</i>ter!\u201d you said indignantly.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not letting some <i>novice </i>wrap my ankle!\u201d<br/></p><p>You could practically <i>hear</i>Tony roll his eyes.\u00a0<i>\u201cJust let him do it, Y/N. It\u2019s not difficult, and I\u2019ll be there soon, anyways.\u201d</i></p><p>You sighed, glancing at Peter before nodding.\u00a0\u201cFine, but be careful. It hurts.\u201d Peter offered a small smile before moving down to your feet and slowly working on taking off your shoe and sock and wrapping your ankle - which was all shades of purple and brown, now - in the bandage. Granted, it was a difficult process, and by the time he\u2019d finished it you had silent tears running down your cheeks, but he immediately went to hug you as soon as he\u2019d finished.</p><p><i>\u201cEverything done? You both alright? Y/N?\u201d</i><br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d you said quietly, a sniffle accompanying it.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Y/N,\u201d Peter said, leaning his head against yours.\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Pete. Thank you for helping.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d he said with a smile. He reached over to tuck a strand of hair behind your ear, eyes widening and hand recoiling immediately as you scrunched your neck up and moved away from him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, no\u2026\u201d<br/></p><p><i>\u201cWhat\u2019d you do?\u201d</i> Tony questioned, and you shook your head frantically at Peter as he frowned a little confusedly at you.<br/></p><p>\u201cI just-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cPeter, no!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201c-touched her ear.\u201d<br/></p><p>A deep chuckle sounded from the other end of the phone.\u00a0<i>\u201cAh, you touched her\u2026 spot.\u201d</i><br/></p><p>Honestly, for a moment, Peter was in complete helplessness as to what exactly that meant, but it didn\u2019t take long to dawn on him. A smile slowly spread across his lips.\u00a0<b>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re ticklish here, <i>too</i>,\u201d</b> he said, reaching up to touch your ear again and laughing when you shook your head violently to escape his hand. He shouldn\u2019t really have been surprised - there wasn\u2019t an ounce of skin on you that <i>wasn\u2019t </i>ticklish - but your <i>ear</i>? It was <i>strange</i>. Still, it was cute, all the same\u2026</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d you said, rolling your eyes and shuffling backwards, careful to keep your ankle as still as possible.<br/></p><p>Tony scoffed.\u00a0<i>\u201c\u2019Course not. Tell that to the squeals still ringing in my ears from last week.\u201d</i><br/></p><p>Peter laughed.\u00a0\u201cWe all wondered where that noise was coming from!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI <i>hate </i>you, Tony,\u201d you grumbled.\u00a0\u201cHope you know that.\u201d<br/></p><p><i>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure. You can kill me when I get there, but, for now, you gotta focus on keeping your ankle still, so no tickling, Mister Parker, alright?\u201d</i></p><p>Peter smiled. \u201cOkay. For now.\u201d<br/></p><p><i>\u201cI agree on that.\u201d</i><br/></p><p>All you could do was face palm.</p>",
