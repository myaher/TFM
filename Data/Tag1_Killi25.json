For me, I thought Villanelle manipulated Eve into killing Raymond because she wanted her to embrace the dark nature Villanelle believes is in her. And she thought Eve&rsquo;s denial of that part of herself was what was keeping them from being together. I don&rsquo;t blame Eve for thinking that&rsquo;s how Villanelle wants her but if that was the true message the writers were trying to convey? Nah. </p><p>Villanelle has a very warped view of love and she does clearly see Eve as someone for her to posses. But up until the last few minutes of the finale, I felt like it was clear that part of what attracted her to Eve was the fact that she saw dark potential in her and a challenge.

At first I figured, \u2018spaghetti\u2019 meant long thing noodles with that red sauce. But then I wasn\u2019t sure if you\u2019d want those balls of meat in it or not. And they had big balls and small balls. So I got both. But they also had the meat just ground up. So I got that. They also had this strange one with bacon, I think? I got that too. But then I thought maybe you wouldn&rsquo;t want meat at all. I know you\u2019re not a vegetarian, but sometimes people don\u2019t like to eat meat right after they kill someone for the first time, so I got one with just the sauce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVillanelle-\u201d</p><p>Villanelle didn\u2019t seem to hear Eve, \u201cThey also had the red sauce that was more spicy. I wasn\u2019t sure if you like spicy or not. You liked that Shepherd&rsquo;s pie thing and that wasn\u2019t spicy but you\u2019re not a boring person so I would think you might like spicy food. So I got all those other ones also with the spicy sauce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVillanelle-\u201d</p><p>She continued on without a breath, \u201cAnd then I realized that maybe you didn\u2019t even mean the red sauce you just meant the long skinny noodles with some other sauce. They had that white milky sauce with that dry skinny cheese. Do you know what I mean? So I got one of those. And one of those with chicken because maybe you want meat but don\u2019t like beef, perhaps. I was worried maybe milk isn\u2019t good for you, so I made sure some of the red sauce ones didn\u2019t have cheese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVillanelle!\u201d Eve exclaimed, taking the last of the containers from Villanelle\u2019s hands, setting them on the table and grabbing her by the shoulders and shaking her slightly. She finally stopped rambling, looking slightly flustered. Eve laughed affectionately, \u201cVillanelle, it\u2019s fine. You didn\u2019t have to do this. Anything you got would have been perfect. I just wanted to have dinner with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Villanelle looked surprised, \u201cOkay. I just wanted to make sure it was good for you.\u201d</p><p>Eve took a step forward, cupping Villanelle\u2019s face with her hands and resting her forehead against Villanelle\u2019s. Several moments of silence passed between.</p><p>Finally, Eve spoke, \u201cI love you, too.\u201d Villanelle sucked in her breath.</p><p>Eve heard the two bags drop to the floor and suddenly Villanelle\u2019s arms were around her waist and their lips were pressed together. When they broke apart, their fast-paced breathing was in sync.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Villanelle said, \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Let\u2019s have dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Villanelle said, picking the bags back up.</p><p>Eve gave her another quick peck on the lips. \u201cThank you, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p>",
