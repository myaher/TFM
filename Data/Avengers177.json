SEB, C\u2019MON!&hellip;. WE CAN GET ICE CREAM AND THAT STUPID CEREAL THAT YOU WANT! You little bastard, where are you?!\u201d I feel like I\u2019m talking to myself as I run around the grocery store.</p><p>One minute I\u2019m telling my 8 year old step-brother that no, he cannot have the sugar-soaked, unnaturally bright cereal and the next minute he\u2019s running screaming \u2018I HATE YOU, NESSA. I HATE YOU AND YOUR BORING CEREAL!!\u2019</p><p>As I yell promises of sugar and rainbow cereal, creeping worry begins to rise up my throat. Oh no, oh no, oh no. Amy, my step-mom, is actually going to kill me.</p><p>\u201cSEBASTIAN!!! YOU LITTLE BASTA- Monkey, WHERE ARE YOU??\u201d</p><p>Even as I attract stares as I yell up the aisles, I begin to run scenarios in my head.</p><p>He\u2019s hiding in the fresh produce section and is probably using a watermelon as a football.</p><p>A random stranger offered him cereal and now\u2019s he\u2019s driving off with them.</p><p>One of Amy\u2019s friends is here, found him and is telling her as we speak.</p><p>He\u2019s standing right in front of me.</p><p>He\u2019s standing right in front of me.</p><p>\u201cSEBASTIAN!!! Oh my GOD!\u201d I (not so mildly) scream as I scoop him up in a bear hug as he fights me off.</p><p>\u201cNot now! Nessa, get off!\u201d Sebastian pushes off me embarrassedly.</p><p>I take a step back, to scold him, when I notice a stranger standing next to us with a very amused expression painted over his face. Seb himself moves back to stand next to the stranger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026Um\u2026\u201d I struggle with my words as I attempt to speak with the man.</p><p>Oh, and by the way, since I don\u2019t think I mentioned it, this stranger also happens to be a walking, breathing, blond Adonis. Keep your chill, VanessaI chide myself, he only looks like a living god. Cutting through my trance, my little brother unwittingly saves me from myself.</p><p>\u201cVanessa, this is Steve. When I decided to go to the park across the street, I sorta, kinda, nearlygothitbyacar,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWHAT?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wait! See, I\u2019m fine. SO, then Steve walks up, we started talking and he said we should come find you!!!! I even told him how you wouldn\u2019t let me get my cereal, but he still said it was a good idea to go back. He\u2019s awesome, right?\u201d My brother then sums it up with that big, toothy grin that makes you feel like you\u2019re looking straight at the Sun.</p><p>I let out a long sigh as I struggle to remain angry at my idiotic little brother and his very attractive friend. With nothing else to say, I thank the random stranger.</p><p>\u201cThank you SO MUCH for bringing him back. I was REALLY worried. He\u2019s only eight and sometimes we have our\u2026 differences\u2026 I\u2019m honestly so thankful that you stopped him from getting hit by a car. If there\u2019s anything I could do for you, I\u2019d be happy to help.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the words fly from my mouth not only do I realise that first, the last bit sounded like innuendo (oh GoD n o), but also that I\u2019ve GRABBED his stunning HAND. As smoothly as I can pull off, I step back while withdrawing my hand. Well done, Vanessa, I think, I practically propositioned him and then groped his hand while doing it. I grabbed Seb\u2019s hand and turn to face Steve when I notice that, in fact, I am not the only one blushing.</p><p>THIS GREEK GOD IS BLUSHING BECAUSE I GRABBED HIS HAND. OH GOD NO, ABORT, ABORT. ABORT MISSION!!</p><p>Deciding that I\u2019ve done enough embarrassing for the day, I mumble a terrified goodbye and turn to leave. Then my darling brother just has to make things more complicated.</p><p>\u201cWhat??! Nessa, no! I don\u2019t want to leave yet. Steve\u2019s my friend!!\u201d</p><p>He throws my hand away and almost tackles Steve. I stand gobsmacked; not that Seb chosen a stranger over me (it\u2019s happened before; long story). It\u2019s the fact that Steve just smiles down at him and ruffles his hair. They\u2019ve know each other for, what, 10 minutes max?! Seb doesn\u2019t let anyone, I MEAN ANYONE, touch his hair! He must take at least 10 minutes every morning to spike it up and Steve gets to touch the hair. It\u2019s at this moment that something shifts in my chest; somehow, I have a tickling feeling that this Steve is not going to just disappear. And honestly, I\u2019m not sure how I feel about that.</p><p>\u201cNessa, c\u2019mon! Don\u2019t be a meanie! Let Steve walk with us while you shop! Please, please, pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaase Nessa! Otherwise\u2026. Otherwise\u2026. I\u2019ll tell Amy that you let me cross the road by myself!\u201d</p><p>I SWEAR TO \u2013THAT LITTLE \u2013 ARGH! Steve looks prepared to apologise or laugh, but I just nod and walk away. Let\u2019s get this over with.</p><p>Seb punches the air in excitement, grabs Steve\u2019s wrist and runs forward to match pace with me. Steve and Seb talk nonstop and it creates an almost comfortable backdrop as I walk around. Occasionally, Seb grabs something off the shelf, which I replace whenever he turns away, but even then he doesn\u2019t stop talking. I start humming to myself as the boys continue to endlessly talk.</p><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s Vanessa, right?\u201d Steve speaks, breaking me violently out of my own thoughts.</p><p>As is becoming my style, I stumble before talking, \u201cUh, um, yeah. That\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>He nods slightly before speaking again, \u201cSo\u2026. Where do you work?\u201d</p><p>I give him a sideways glance at the slightly awkward conversation opener, but I decided to take the bait anyway, \u201cWell, I\u2019m just out of NYU with a biochem degree, so I\u2019m looking for a research job. But for the moment, I work in a diner. What about you?\u201d</p><p>He looks surprised, THEN BLUSHES AGAIN (LORD, SPARE ME), nods, nods again before spluttering out \u201cOh, ok. Me, I\u2019m\u2026 Ex-military. I\u2019m currently in veterans\u2019 affairs. But yeah, that\u2019s pretty awesome&hellip; The biochem degree! It must\u2019ve been difficult going through college with a kid.\u201d</p><p>I felt like the rhythm of the conversation was finally smoothing out. Hey, this isn\u2019t so ba- Hang on. It must\u2019ve been difficult going through college with a kid\u2026. Where did her get that ide- Oh no, he wouldn- Not Seb, he\u2019s my BROT-</p><p>\u201cWhat?! Oh! Seb is my STEP-BROTHER! I\u2019m 22 and Seb\u2019s 8\u2026. No, no, NO. I just hang out with him on weekends to give Amy and Dad a break! God, Seb, my kid?! No.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019VE MADE HIM BLUSH AGAIN, BY GOD SINCE WHEN HAVE I HAD THE ABILITY TO MAKE GODS FLUSH?! WHAT IS THIS?!?</p><p>HE\u2019S EVEN REDDER THAN BEFORE!! LOOK AT HIM; HE\u2019S TRYING REALLY HARD TO APOLOGISE, BUT HE\u2019S SO EMBARRASSED HE CAN BARELY SPEAK. OH DEAR LORD, SAVE ME! THIS MAN, THIS BOY, LOOKS LIKE HE\u2019S ABOUT TO PASS OUT.</p><p>SEB, YOU IDIOT, STOP LAUGHING. GOD, WHY ME? WHAT HAVE I DONE TO DESERVE THIS EXTREMELY HOT, ADORABLE, BLUSHING ADONIS IN MY LIFE?!?!</p><p>I take some breaths, calm myself and defuse the situation. Steve apologies profusely, using phrases that I haven\u2019t heard outside my grandmother\u2019s house, and we all go about our business.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014<br/></p><p>Eventually I realise that I really can\u2019t buy anything else and that I really don\u2019t want to stop talking to Steve (C\u2019mon, Vanessa, woman up!). As I come to this realisation, Steve also turns to look at his watch. His eyes widen slightly and before I know it, we\u2019re all running to checkout. Steve mumbles about \u2018a stupid meeting he really needs to go to\u2019 and \u2018of course, the one day he actually has something better to do\u2019 (STOP SMILING VANESSA, HE\u2019S TALKING ABOUT SEBASTIAN!). We rush though the checkout, reach the shop\u2019s doors and pause.</p><p>Seb\u2019s almost in tears at the thought of Steve leaving and I must say, my feelings are similar.</p><p>He\u2019s just so kind; like honest to God, he just does whatever\u2019s right because he didn\u2019t even think about it, it\u2019s just his instinct. Steve also treats Sebastian really well; \u2018judge a person on how they treat their inferiors\u2019 and all that jazz. He also has an amusingly peculiar perspective on everything.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>Steve: \u2018What the hell is that?\u2019</p><p>\u2026</p><p>Me: \u2018Um, a price-checker?\u2019</p><p>Steve: \u2018oh. yeah. Stupid me, my head\u2019s in the clouds. Sorry, anyway\u2026\u2019</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cWell, ma\u2019a- Vanessa\u2026 It\u2019s been a, uh, pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t WANT YOU TO GO, STEVE!!\u201d</p><p>(Don\u2019t worry, that wasn\u2019t me.) \u00a0Seb screams this out to the world and attaches himself to Steve\u2019s leg. Steve looks slightly awkward until he simply smiles and bends down to speak with Seb. They talk for a while until Seb ends up wiping his nose on his sleeve and nodding enthusiastically. Steve walks over to his bike, sits down, takes a notebook from his pocket and scribbles something down. He beckons to me and with slight butterflies in my stomach (STOP IT, EVERYBODY JUST CALM. THE. HELL. DOWN. PLEASE), I walk forwards. I get almost intimately close before he starts talking. (SHUT UP ME, YOU\u2019RE NOT THAT CLOSE&hellip; ACTUALLY, YOU ARE\u2026. STEP BACK, STEP BACK, BEEP BEEP BEEP, BACK THE FUCK UP!)</p><p>\u201cI was wondering\u2026if you would like to grab a coffee sometime? I mean, you don\u2019t have to tell me now. Sebastian told me you would be cool with this, so\u2026 Here. Hopefully, I\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d</p><p>After pressing something into my hand and giving me a smile that could melt a winter, he put on his helmet and rode away. Vaguely, I thought that I must look like an idiot, smiling on the pavement. Eventually, I come back to earth and look at the piece of paper in my hand.</p><p><b>(212) 555 0018 Steve</b></p><p>oH LoRD HAVE MERCY, HE DREW A FREAKIN\u2019 SMILEY FACE!!!!</p>",

No.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019VE MADE HIM BLUSH AGAIN, BY GOD SINCE WHEN HAVE I HAD THE ABILITY TO MAKE GODS FLUSH?! WHAT IS THIS?!?</p><p>HE\u2019S EVEN REDDER THAN BEFORE!! LOOK AT HIM; HE\u2019S TRYING REALLY HARD TO APOLOGISE, BUT HE\u2019S SO EMBARRASSED HE CAN BARELY SPEAK. OH DEAR LORD, SAVE ME! THIS MAN, THIS BOY, LOOKS LIKE HE\u2019S ABOUT TO PASS OUT.</p><p>SEB, YOU IDIOT, STOP LAUGHING. GOD, WHY ME? WHAT HAVE I DONE TO DESERVE THIS EXTREMELY HOT, ADORABLE, BLUSHING ADONIS IN MY LIFE?!?!</p><p>I take some breaths, calm myself and defuse the situation. Steve apologies profusely, using phrases that I haven\u2019t heard outside my grandmother\u2019s house, and we all go about our business.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014<br></p><p>Eventually I realise that I really can\u2019t buy anything else and that I really don\u2019t want to stop talking to Steve (C\u2019mon, Vanessa, woman up!). As I come to this realisation, Steve also turns to look at his watch. His eyes widen slightly and before I know it, we\u2019re all running to checkout. Steve mumbles about \u2018a stupid meeting he really needs to go to\u2019 and \u2018of course, the one day he actually has something better to do\u2019 (STOP SMILING VANESSA, HE\u2019S TALKING ABOUT SEBASTIAN!). We rush though the checkout, reach the shop\u2019s doors and pause.</p><p>Seb\u2019s almost in tears at the thought of Steve leaving and I must say, my feelings are similar.</p><p>He\u2019s just so kind; like honest to God, he just does whatever\u2019s right because he didn\u2019t even think about it, it\u2019s just his instinct. Steve also treats Sebastian really well; \u2018judge a person on how they treat their inferiors\u2019 and all that jazz. He also has an amusingly peculiar perspective on everything.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>Steve: \u2018What the hell is that?\u2019</p><p>\u2026</p><p>Me: \u2018Um, a price-checker?\u2019</p><p>Steve: \u2018oh. yeah. Stupid me, my head\u2019s in the clouds. Sorry, anyway\u2026\u2019</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cWell, ma\u2019a- Vanessa\u2026 It\u2019s been a, uh, pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t WANT YOU TO GO, STEVE!!\u201d</p><p>(Don\u2019t worry, that wasn\u2019t me.) \u00a0Seb screams this out to the world and attaches himself to Steve\u2019s leg. Steve looks slightly awkward until he simply smiles and bends down to speak with Seb. They talk for a while until Seb ends up wiping his nose on his sleeve and nodding enthusiastically. Steve walks over to his bike, sits down, takes a notebook from his pocket and scribbles something down. He beckons to me and with slight butterflies in my stomach (STOP IT, EVERYBODY JUST CALM. THE. HELL. DOWN. PLEASE), I walk forwards. I get almost intimately close before he starts talking. (SHUT UP ME, YOU\u2019RE NOT THAT CLOSE\u2026 ACTUALLY, YOU ARE\u2026. STEP BACK, STEP BACK, BEEP BEEP BEEP, BACK THE FUCK UP!)</p><p>\u201cI was wondering\u2026if you would like to grab a coffee sometime? I mean, you don\u2019t have to tell me now. Sebastian told me you would be cool with this, so\u2026 Here. Hopefully, I\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d</p><p>After pressing something into my hand and giving me a smile that could melt a winter, he put on his helmet and rode away. Vaguely, I thought that I must look like an idiot, smiling on the pavement. Eventually, I come back to earth and look at the piece of paper in my hand.</p><p><b>(212) 555 0018 Steve</b></p><p>oH LoRD HAVE MERCY, HE DREW A FREAKIN\u2019 SMILEY FACE!!!!</p>",

SEB, C\u2019MON!\u2026. WE CAN GET ICE CREAM AND THAT STUPID CEREAL THAT YOU WANT! You little bastard, where are you?!\u201d I feel like I\u2019m talking to myself as I run around the grocery store.</p><p>One minute I\u2019m telling my 8 year old step-brother that no, he cannot have the sugar-soaked, unnaturally bright cereal and the next minute he\u2019s running screaming \u2018I HATE YOU, NESSA. I HATE YOU AND YOUR BORING CEREAL!!\u2019</p><p>As I yell promises of sugar and rainbow cereal, creeping worry begins to rise up my throat. Oh no, oh no, oh no. Amy, my step-mom, is actually going to kill me.</p><p>\u201cSEBASTIAN!!! YOU LITTLE BASTA- Monkey, WHERE ARE YOU??\u201d</p><p>Even as I attract stares as I yell up the aisles, I begin to run scenarios in my head.</p><p>He\u2019s hiding in the fresh produce section and is probably using a watermelon as a football.</p><p>A random stranger offered him cereal and now\u2019s he\u2019s driving off with them.</p><p>One of Amy\u2019s friends is here, found him and is telling her as we speak.</p><p>He\u2019s standing right in front of me.</p><p>He\u2019s standing right in front of me.</p><p>\u201cSEBASTIAN!!! Oh my GOD!\u201d I (not so mildly) scream as I scoop him up in a bear hug as he fights me off.</p><p>\u201cNot now! Nessa, get off!\u201d Sebastian pushes off me embarrassedly.</p><p>I take a step back, to scold him, when I notice a stranger standing next to us with a very amused expression painted over his face. Seb himself moves back to stand next to the stranger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026Um\u2026\u201d I struggle with my words as I attempt to speak with the man.</p><p>Oh, and by the way, since I don\u2019t think I mentioned it, this stranger also happens to be a walking, breathing, blond Adonis. Keep your chill, VanessaI chide myself, he only looks like a living god. Cutting through my trance, my little brother unwittingly saves me from myself.</p><p>\u201cVanessa, this is Steve. When I decided to go to the park across the street, I sorta, kinda, nearlygothitbyacar,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWHAT?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wait! See, I\u2019m fine. SO, then Steve walks up, we started talking and he said we should come find you!!!! I even told him how you wouldn\u2019t let me get my cereal, but he still said it was a good idea to go back. He\u2019s awesome, right?\u201d My brother then sums it up with that big, toothy grin that makes you feel like you\u2019re looking straight at the Sun.</p><p>I let out a long sigh as I struggle to remain angry at my idiotic little brother and his very attractive friend. With nothing else to say, I thank the random stranger.</p><p>\u201cThank you SO MUCH for bringing him back. I was REALLY worried. He\u2019s only eight and sometimes we have our\u2026 differences\u2026 I\u2019m honestly so thankful that you stopped him from getting hit by a car. If there\u2019s anything I could do for you, I\u2019d be happy to help.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the words fly from my mouth not only do I realise that first, the last bit sounded like innuendo (oh GoD n o), but also that I\u2019ve GRABBED his stunning HAND. As smoothly as I can pull off, I step back while withdrawing my hand. Well done, Vanessa, I think, I practically propositioned him and then groped his hand while doing it. I grabbed Seb\u2019s hand and turn to face Steve when I notice that, in fact, I am not the only one blushing.</p><p>THIS GREEK GOD IS BLUSHING BECAUSE I GRABBED HIS HAND. OH GOD NO, ABORT, ABORT. ABORT MISSION!!</p><p>Deciding that I\u2019ve done enough embarrassing for the day, I mumble a terrified goodbye and turn to leave. Then my darling brother just has to make things more complicated.</p><p>\u201cWhat??! Nessa, no! I don\u2019t want to leave yet. Steve\u2019s my friend!!\u201d</p><p>He throws my hand away and almost tackles Steve. I stand gobsmacked; not that Seb chosen a stranger over me (it\u2019s happened before; long story). It\u2019s the fact that Steve just smiles down at him and ruffles his hair. They\u2019ve know each other for, what, 10 minutes max?! Seb doesn\u2019t let anyone, I MEAN ANYONE, touch his hair! He must take at least 10 minutes every morning to spike it up and Steve gets to touch the hair. It\u2019s at this moment that something shifts in my chest; somehow, I have a tickling feeling that this Steve is not going to just disappear. And honestly, I\u2019m not sure how I feel about that.</p><p>\u201cNessa, c\u2019mon! Don\u2019t be a meanie! Let Steve walk with us while you shop! Please, please, pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaase Nessa! Otherwise\u2026. Otherwise\u2026. I\u2019ll tell Amy that you let me cross the road by myself!\u201d</p><p>I SWEAR TO \u2013THAT LITTLE \u2013 ARGH! Steve looks prepared to apologise or laugh, but I just nod and walk away. Let\u2019s get this over with.</p><p>Seb punches the air in excitement, grabs Steve\u2019s wrist and runs forward to match pace with me. Steve and Seb talk nonstop and it creates an almost comfortable backdrop as I walk around. Occasionally, Seb grabs something off the shelf, which I replace whenever he turns away, but even then he doesn\u2019t stop talking. I start humming to myself as the boys continue to endlessly talk.</p><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s Vanessa, right?\u201d Steve speaks, breaking me violently out of my own thoughts.</p><p>As is becoming my style, I stumble before talking, \u201cUh, um, yeah. That\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>He nods slightly before speaking again, \u201cSo\u2026. Where do you work?\u201d</p><p>I give him a sideways glance at the slightly awkward conversation opener, but I decided to take the bait anyway, \u201cWell, I\u2019m just out of NYU with a biochem degree, so I\u2019m looking for a research job. But for the moment, I work in a diner. What about you?\u201d</p><p>He looks surprised, THEN BLUSHES AGAIN (LORD, SPARE ME), nods, nods again before spluttering out \u201cOh, ok. Me, I\u2019m\u2026 Ex-military. I\u2019m currently in veterans\u2019 affairs. But yeah, that\u2019s pretty awesome\u2026 The biochem degree! It must\u2019ve been difficult going through college with a kid.\u201d</p><p>I felt like the rhythm of the conversation was finally smoothing out. Hey, this isn\u2019t so ba- Hang on. It must\u2019ve been difficult going through college with a kid\u2026. Where did her get that ide- Oh no, he wouldn- Not Seb, he\u2019s my BROT-</p><p>\u201cWhat?! Oh! Seb is my STEP-BROTHER! I\u2019m 22 and Seb\u2019s 8\u2026. No, no, NO. I just hang out with him on weekends to give Amy and Dad a break! God, Seb, my kid?! No.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019VE MADE HIM BLUSH AGAIN, BY GOD SINCE WHEN HAVE I HAD THE ABILITY TO MAKE GODS FLUSH?! WHAT IS THIS?!?</p><p>HE\u2019S EVEN REDDER THAN BEFORE!!

Me, I&rsquo;m&hellip; Ex-military. I&rsquo;m currently in veterans&rsquo; affairs. But yeah, that&rsquo;s pretty awesome&hellip; The biochem degree! It must&rsquo;ve been difficult going through college with a kid.&rdquo;</p><p>I felt like the rhythm of the conversation was finally smoothing out. Hey, this isn&rsquo;t so ba- Hang on. It must&rsquo;ve been difficult going through college with a kid&hellip;. Where did her get that ide- Oh no, he wouldn- Not Seb, he&rsquo;s my BROT-</p><p>&ldquo;What?! Oh! Seb is my STEP-BROTHER! I&rsquo;m 22 and Seb&rsquo;s 8&hellip;. No, no, NO. I just hang out with him on weekends to give Amy and Dad a break! God, Seb, my kid?! No.&rdquo;</p><p>I&rsquo;VE MADE HIM BLUSH AGAIN, BY GOD SINCE WHEN HAVE I HAD THE ABILITY TO MAKE GODS FLUSH?! WHAT IS THIS?!?</p><p>HE&rsquo;S EVEN REDDER THAN BEFORE!! LOOK AT HIM; HE&rsquo;S TRYING REALLY HARD TO APOLOGISE, BUT HE&rsquo;S SO EMBARRASSED HE CAN BARELY SPEAK. OH DEAR LORD, SAVE ME! THIS MAN, THIS BOY, LOOKS LIKE HE&rsquo;S ABOUT TO PASS OUT.</p><p>SEB, YOU IDIOT, STOP LAUGHING. GOD, WHY ME? WHAT HAVE I DONE TO DESERVE THIS EXTREMELY HOT, ADORABLE, BLUSHING ADONIS IN MY LIFE?!?!</p><p>I take some breaths, calm myself and defuse the situation. Steve apologies profusely, using phrases that I haven&rsquo;t heard outside my grandmother&rsquo;s house, and we all go about our business.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br /></p><p>Eventually I realise that I really can&rsquo;t buy anything else and that I really don&rsquo;t want to stop talking to Steve (C&rsquo;mon, Vanessa, woman up!). As I come to this realisation, Steve also turns to look at his watch. His eyes widen slightly and before I know it, we&rsquo;re all running to checkout. Steve mumbles about &lsquo;a stupid meeting he really needs to go to&rsquo; and &lsquo;of course, the one day he actually has something better to do&rsquo; (STOP SMILING VANESSA, HE&rsquo;S TALKING ABOUT SEBASTIAN!). We rush though the checkout, reach the shop&rsquo;s doors and pause.</p><p>Seb&rsquo;s almost in tears at the thought of Steve leaving and I must say, my feelings are similar.</p><p>He&rsquo;s just so kind; like honest to God, he just does whatever&rsquo;s right because he didn&rsquo;t even think about it, it&rsquo;s just his instinct. Steve also treats Sebastian really well; &lsquo;judge a person on how they treat their inferiors&rsquo; and all that jazz. He also has an amusingly peculiar perspective on everything.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>Steve: &lsquo;What the hell is that?&rsquo;</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>Me: &lsquo;Um, a price-checker?&rsquo;</p><p>Steve: &lsquo;oh. yeah. Stupid me, my head&rsquo;s in the clouds. Sorry, anyway&hellip;&rsquo;</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, ma&rsquo;a- Vanessa&hellip; It&rsquo;s been a, uh, pleasure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t WANT YOU TO GO, STEVE!!&rdquo;</p><p>(Don&rsquo;t worry, that wasn&rsquo;t me.) &nbsp;Seb screams this out to the world and attaches himself to Steve&rsquo;s leg. Steve looks slightly awkward until he simply smiles and bends down to speak with Seb. They talk for a while until Seb ends up wiping his nose on his sleeve and nodding enthusiastically. Steve walks over to his bike, sits down, takes a notebook from his pocket and scribbles something down. He beckons to me and with slight butterflies in my stomach (STOP IT, EVERYBODY JUST CALM. THE. HELL. DOWN. PLEASE), I walk forwards. I get almost intimately close before he starts talking. (SHUT UP ME, YOU&rsquo;RE NOT THAT CLOSE&hellip; ACTUALLY, YOU ARE&hellip;. STEP BACK, STEP BACK, BEEP BEEP BEEP, BACK THE FUCK UP!)</p><p>&ldquo;I was wondering&hellip;if you would like to grab a coffee sometime? I mean, you don&rsquo;t have to tell me now. Sebastian told me you would be cool with this, so&hellip; Here. Hopefully, I&rsquo;ll see you soon.&rdquo;</p><p>After pressing something into my hand and giving me a smile that could melt a winter, he put on his helmet and rode away. Vaguely, I thought that I must look like an idiot, smiling on the pavement. Eventually, I come back to earth and look at the piece of paper in my hand.</p><p><b>(212) 555 0018 Steve</b></p><p>oH LoRD HAVE MERCY, HE DREW A FREAKIN&rsquo; SMILEY FACE!!!!</p>",
