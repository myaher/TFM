It felt like she had barely found a place that she and Talos deemed safe before Skrulls started to disappear right before her eyes with no explanation. Then her beeper went off. Carol was quick to to assume that maybe something similar was happening back on Earth.<b><br/></b></p><p>She made Talos promise that he would stay put and watch those who had survived while she got to the bottom of things. Nick seemed to be safe at the very least, but the thought of Regan turning to dust sent panic through Carol. She had promised her that she would be back before she knew it, and now there was a chance that she\u2019d never see her again. </p><p>The signal was coming from New York. Carol didn\u2019t recognize the building that was standing before her, or the large A that adorned its side. Was this part of SHIELD? Whatever it was it seemed empty. She was quick to take in her surroundings for any sign of danger, but Carol didn\u2019t see a sign of much of <i>anything</i>. It would make getting inside easy at least. No real security. It was a compound of some kind, that much she could tell. Government maybe? Whatever it was, the place was like a ghost town. Someone had to have sent her the distress signal, but now Carol wasn\u2019t sure if there was anyone left for her to help. </p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean? Is it dead?\u201d Carol stopped when she heard the woman\u2019s voice. It was coming from somewhere down the hall. Relief washed over Carol. She walked down the hallway quickly, coming to a large room that she quickly realized was a lab of some kind. There was a group of people with their backs turned towards her&hellip;and a raccoon? Carol frowned, her head tilting to the side as she walked up to the group. They were crowded around Nick\u2019s beeper, but there was no Nick in sight. </p><p>\u201c&hellip;Where\u2019s Nick?\u201d she asked, her head held high. The group turned around almost in perfect sync. Each of them were on high alert and ready to attack. All but one. Carol exhaled slowly. Her arms dropped to her sides. Regan stood at the head of the group. Her long, red hair was tied up in a mess on top of her head and she was in her pajamas for some reason, but she was <i>there</i>. She was safe. </p><p>They moved at the same time. In just a few quick strides Carol met Regan at the center of the room. She took Regan\u2019s face in her gloved hands, running her thumb over the witch\u2019s cheek almost as if to make sure she was really there. Regan grasped at Carol\u2019s arms, her eyes brimming with tears. \u201cSorry I took so long.\u201d Carol breathed, leaning forward and capturing Regan\u2019s lips with her own. Neither of them cared about the group standing there awkwardly watching the display of affection. Carol cared about nothing other than holding onto Regan as tightly as possible, and the salty taste of her tears on her lips. </p><p>\u201c&hellip;Is that Carol?\u201d someone whispered behind them. Regan laughed lightly, pulling away from Carol finally and turning back to the group. </p><p>\u201cYes, Bruce. This is Carol,\u201d she stood beside the blonde, her hands wrapping around one of Carol\u2019s. \u2018And these are the Avengers. They\u2019re with Nick.\u201d she explained. Carol looked over the team briefly, her eyes narrowing a little.</p><p>\u201cWhere<i> is</i> Nick?\u201d she asked. </p><p>Steve gave a passing glance to Natasha, tucking his hands into his pockets awkwardly. \u201cHe\u2019s&hellip;gone. He was taken with the Snap. He must have had just enough time to send you the signal before he&hellip;well, we\u2019re not really sure what\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>Carol\u2019s jaw clenched for a brief moment. Regan gave her hand a tight squeeze. She wanted to reassure her that everything would be okay. She wanted to tell Carol that they would fix this, and get Nick back. But she couldn\u2019t make that promise. There was a chance that everything wouldn\u2019t be okay. \u201cWho did this?\u201d Carol asked. </p><p>\u201cA big purple bastard named Thanos.\u201d it as Rocket that answered.</p><p>Carol looked down at him, eyebrows raised in surprise. \u201cYou can talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I can talk. Why\u2019s everyone always so surprised I can talk?\u201d he asked, shooting an incredulous look up at Bruce. Bruce could only shrug. </p><p>\u201cI was actually explaining it all to Regan before you got here,\u201d Bruce began. \u201cI can fill you in, get you up to speed. Maybe fill you in on everything you\u2019ve missed while you were gone.\u201d he offered. </p><p>Carol shot Regan and Bruce confused looks. \u201cWhat do you mean? How long could I have been gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201c&hellip;Twenty four years.\u201d Regan said quietly. </p><p>\u201c<i>What</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, this might take awhile\u2026\u201d Bruce mumbled, rubbing the back of his neck. </p><p>&mdash;</p><p>It was late now. Regan was finding it hard to believe that it had only been 24 hours since Steve and Natasha had shown up at her door. Bruce explained the Infinity Stones and their powers to Carol, as well as explaining her connection to them. Everyone seemed to think there was a real chance of reversing what Thanos had done. With Carol on their side it seemed like she would make their plan run more smoothly. </p><p>And while Regan was over the moon to have Carol back, she couldn\u2019t help but feel a little useless now. There wasn\u2019t much she could do to help. Well, on the saving the universe front. She would always be able to help pull Carol out of a funk. </p><p>They were both in Regan\u2019s room for the night. Everyone was turning in so they could get an early start the next morning and begin strategizing. Carol was in bed, staring up at the ceiling quietly. Kit and Molly were curled up at the foot of the bed. \u201cI feel like as soon as I get my bearings everything gets turned upside down again,\u201d Carol said suddenly. </p><p>Regan turned to her, setting her bag down and sitting on the edge of the bed. \u201cI thought I was only gone for a week at the most. A <i>week</i>. And now half of the entire universe is gone? <i>Nick</i> is gone\u2026\u201d</p><p>Regan slid into the bed next to Carol, resting her head on her hand. \u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re not blaming yourself for this, Carol.\u201d</p><p>Carol was silent for a long moment. \u201c&hellip;Not entirely. But if I had been here maybe I could have helped stop it.\u201d Regan wished Carol wouldn\u2019t beat herself up so much over every little thing that went wrong. It had been this way since she met Carol. And she knew that it had everything to do with the way Carol was raised. Her parents had been less than supportive. But Regan was fully prepared to make up for the areas in which they had lacked.</p><p>\u201cCarol, we had no way of knowing something like this would happen. And you weren\u2019t here because you were helping Talos. Sure, you weren\u2019t there when Thanos attacked. But you\u2019re here now. And you can help them make things right. That\u2019s what matters.\u201d she placed a hand gently on Carol\u2019s shoulder. </p><p>Carol nodded, turning over on her side to face Regan. \u201cDo you think things will ever be normal?\u201d</p><p>Regan scrunched her nose. \u201cNot a chance,\u201d she said, the both of them chuckling. \u201cBut hopefully it\u2019ll be as normal as things can be for a witch and a superhero.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI kinda figured our normal days were over once the raccoon started talking,\u201d Carol joked, the pair bursting into a quiet fit of giggles. </p><p>\u201c<i>Rocket</i>. You have to start calling him Rocket. He gets really annoyed when people call him the raccoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. Rocket,\u201d Carol said. She wrapped her arm around Regan\u2019s middle and pulled her closer, resting her forehead against Regan\u2019s. \u201cYou know, maybe once all of this is over we can take a break. We can go back home and just enjoy being normal for awhile. Our kind of normal anyways.\u201d she teased.</p><p>Regan smiled lightly and nodded. \u201cI\u2019d love that.\u201d Regan had a feeling that there was a possibility Carol and the Avengers were being a bit too firm in the idea that they would stop Thanos. Just like she was unable to speak to those who had disappeared, she was unable to see any sort of vision when it came to the Infinity Gauntlet. But she couldn\u2019t ignore the feeling in her gut. </p><p>For now she would just put her confidence in Carol and those that Nick put his trust in. It had to work. Regan wasn\u2019t sure what they would do if it didn\u2019t. </p>",

Each of them were on high alert and ready to attack. All but one. Carol exhaled slowly. Her arms dropped to her sides. Regan stood at the head of the group. Her long, red hair was tied up in a mess on top of her head and she was in her pajamas for some reason, but she was <i>there</i>. She was safe. </p><p>They moved at the same time. In just a few quick strides Carol met Regan at the center of the room. She took Regan\u2019s face in her gloved hands, running her thumb over the witch\u2019s cheek almost as if to make sure she was really there. Regan grasped at Carol\u2019s arms, her eyes brimming with tears. \u201cSorry I took so long.\u201d Carol breathed, leaning forward and capturing Regan\u2019s lips with her own. Neither of them cared about the group standing there awkwardly watching the display of affection. Carol cared about nothing other than holding onto Regan as tightly as possible, and the salty taste of her tears on her lips. </p><p>\u201c\u2026Is that Carol?\u201d someone whispered behind them. Regan laughed lightly, pulling away from Carol finally and turning back to the group. </p><p>\u201cYes, Bruce. This is Carol,\u201d she stood beside the blonde, her hands wrapping around one of Carol\u2019s. \u2018And these are the Avengers. They\u2019re with Nick.\u201d she explained. Carol looked over the team briefly, her eyes narrowing a little.</p><p>\u201cWhere<i> is</i> Nick?\u201d she asked. </p><p>Steve gave a passing glance to Natasha, tucking his hands into his pockets awkwardly. \u201cHe\u2019s\u2026gone. He was taken with the Snap. He must have had just enough time to send you the signal before he\u2026well, we\u2019re not really sure what\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>Carol\u2019s jaw clenched for a brief moment. Regan gave her hand a tight squeeze. She wanted to reassure her that everything would be okay. She wanted to tell Carol that they would fix this, and get Nick back. But she couldn\u2019t make that promise. There was a chance that everything wouldn\u2019t be okay. \u201cWho did this?\u201d Carol asked. </p><p>\u201cA big purple bastard named Thanos.\u201d it as Rocket that answered.</p><p>Carol looked down at him, eyebrows raised in surprise. \u201cYou can talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I can talk. Why\u2019s everyone always so surprised I can talk?\u201d he asked, shooting an incredulous look up at Bruce. Bruce could only shrug. </p><p>\u201cI was actually explaining it all to Regan before you got here,\u201d Bruce began. \u201cI can fill you in, get you up to speed. Maybe fill you in on everything you\u2019ve missed while you were gone.\u201d he offered. </p><p>Carol shot Regan and Bruce confused looks. \u201cWhat do you mean? How long could I have been gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026Twenty four years.\u201d Regan said quietly. </p><p>\u201c<i>What</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, this might take awhile\u2026\u201d Bruce mumbled, rubbing the back of his neck. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>It was late now. Regan was finding it hard to believe that it had only been 24 hours since Steve and Natasha had shown up at her door. Bruce explained the Infinity Stones and their powers to Carol, as well as explaining her connection to them. Everyone seemed to think there was a real chance of reversing what Thanos had done. With Carol on their side it seemed like she would make their plan run more smoothly. </p><p>And while Regan was over the moon to have Carol back, she couldn\u2019t help but feel a little useless now. There wasn\u2019t much she could do to help. Well, on the saving the universe front. She would always be able to help pull Carol out of a funk. </p><p>They were both in Regan\u2019s room for the night. Everyone was turning in so they could get an early start the next morning and begin strategizing. Carol was in bed, staring up at the ceiling quietly. Kit and Molly were curled up at the foot of the bed. \u201cI feel like as soon as I get my bearings everything gets turned upside down again,\u201d Carol said suddenly. </p><p>Regan turned to her, setting her bag down and sitting on the edge of the bed. \u201cI thought I was only gone for a week at the most. A <i>week</i>. And now half of the entire universe is gone? <i>Nick</i> is gone\u2026\u201d</p><p>Regan slid into the bed next to Carol, resting her head on her hand. \u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re not blaming yourself for this, Carol.\u201d</p><p>Carol was silent for a long moment. \u201c\u2026Not entirely. But if I had been here maybe I could have helped stop it.\u201d Regan wished Carol wouldn\u2019t beat herself up so much over every little thing that went wrong. It had been this way since she met Carol. And she knew that it had everything to do with the way Carol was raised. Her parents had been less than supportive. But Regan was fully prepared to make up for the areas in which they had lacked.</p><p>\u201cCarol, we had no way of knowing something like this would happen. And you weren\u2019t here because you were helping Talos. Sure, you weren\u2019t there when Thanos attacked. But you\u2019re here now. And you can help them make things right. That\u2019s what matters.\u201d she placed a hand gently on Carol\u2019s shoulder. </p><p>Carol nodded, turning over on her side to face Regan. \u201cDo you think things will ever be normal?\u201d</p><p>Regan scrunched her nose. \u201cNot a chance,\u201d she said, the both of them chuckling. \u201cBut hopefully it\u2019ll be as normal as things can be for a witch and a superhero.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI kinda figured our normal days were over once the raccoon started talking,\u201d Carol joked, the pair bursting into a quiet fit of giggles. </p><p>\u201c<i>Rocket</i>. You have to start calling him Rocket. He gets really annoyed when people call him the raccoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. Rocket,\u201d Carol said. She wrapped her arm around Regan\u2019s middle and pulled her closer, resting her forehead against Regan\u2019s. \u201cYou know, maybe once all of this is over we can take a break. We can go back home and just enjoy being normal for awhile. Our kind of normal anyways.\u201d she teased.</p><p>Regan smiled lightly and nodded. \u201cI\u2019d love that.\u201d Regan had a feeling that there was a possibility Carol and the Avengers were being a bit too firm in the idea that they would stop Thanos. Just like she was unable to speak to those who had disappeared, she was unable to see any sort of vision when it came to the Infinity Gauntlet. But she couldn\u2019t ignore the feeling in her gut. </p><p>For now she would just put her confidence in Carol and those that Nick put his trust in. It had to work. Regan wasn\u2019t sure what they would do if it didn\u2019t. </p></p>",

Time passed by differently for her while she was travelling through the galaxies. It felt like she had barely found a place that she and Talos deemed safe before Skrulls started to disappear right before her eyes with no explanation. Then her beeper went off. Carol was quick to to assume that maybe something similar was happening back on Earth.<b><br /></b></p><p>She made Talos promise that he would stay put and watch those who had survived while she got to the bottom of things. Nick seemed to be safe at the very least, but the thought of Regan turning to dust sent panic through Carol. She had promised her that she would be back before she knew it, and now there was a chance that she&rsquo;d never see her again. </p><p>The signal was coming from New York. Carol didn&rsquo;t recognize the building that was standing before her, or the large A that adorned its side. Was this part of SHIELD? Whatever it was it seemed empty. She was quick to take in her surroundings for any sign of danger, but Carol didn&rsquo;t see a sign of much of <i>anything</i>. It would make getting inside easy at least. No real security. It was a compound of some kind, that much she could tell. Government maybe? Whatever it was, the place was like a ghost town. Someone had to have sent her the distress signal, but now Carol wasn&rsquo;t sure if there was anyone left for her to help. </p><p>&ldquo;What does that mean? Is it dead?&rdquo; Carol stopped when she heard the woman&rsquo;s voice. It was coming from somewhere down the hall. Relief washed over Carol. She walked down the hallway quickly, coming to a large room that she quickly realized was a lab of some kind. There was a group of people with their backs turned towards her&hellip;and a raccoon? Carol frowned, her head tilting to the side as she walked up to the group. They were crowded around Nick&rsquo;s beeper, but there was no Nick in sight. </p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;Where&rsquo;s Nick?&rdquo; she asked, her head held high.

Hope you enjoy ;)</b></i></p><p>It was a beautiful evening on Hala. Your mistress was invited to a celebration for the starforce. She was of high status in the ranks and you were given to her as a gift a few years back, which is tradition on Hala for commanding officers. She was given the right to choose who she wanted and she could not keep hers eyes off of you. You got lucky with Vers. She treated you like any other Kree, like you weren\u2019t a sex slave, only in the confines of your home. Unfortunately the rest of the population isn\u2019t accepting of slaves being treated as anything other than property. In private you could be a normal couple but in public, you had to follow the rules and sometimes you make a mistake.<br/></p><!-- more --><p>You made the mistake of addressing her as her given name and not of what you\u2019re meant to call her in public. You could have called her Sir, Mistress, Master, or Daddy (which is both of your personal favorite.) But you had to go and fuck it up calling her Vers. Yon-Rogg happened to be present and he raised his hand to slap you when Vers grabbed his wrist and held on tightly. She was angry, glaring at him. I\u2019m sure she was also not too happy that she would have to publicly punish you as well. She\u2019s not too fond of punishing you publicly but she knows you get off on it. Being humiliated in front of so many people, letting them know who you belong to. Who <b><i>owns</i></b> you. </p><p>\u201cHow dare you raise a hand to my girl! <i><b>No one </b></i>touches her but me!\u201d </p><p>He rips his arm away from Vers and glares down at me, \u201cYou dare let her speak your name? Don\u2019t tell me she\u2019s made you soft, Vers?\u201d He taunts as his eyes snap back to hers. She huffs angrily and raises her hand.</p><p>Which is why you are suddenly on the floor after Vers slapped your cheek sending you to the ground holding your right cheek, a burning sensation heightened with the use of her powers.<br/></p><p>She grabs you by your collar and pulls you to your knees. She looks down at you asking with her eyes if you were okay. You nod slightly, slick between your thighs. She knows what she\u2019s doing to you, she can smell your cunt already. She licks her lips and smirks down at you.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat does your collar say, babygirl?\u201d </p><p>You whimper and dart your eyes around to the crowd of people gathered near you. She bends down and grabs a fistful of your hair pulling back till you yelp and set your eyes on hers.</p><p>\u201cEyes on me, little one. They don\u2019t matter, I do. I asked a question. I expect an answer.\u201d</p><p>You swallow what moisture you had in your mouth, \u201cGood girl.\u201d You whisper. She huffs and tightens her grip on your hair. \u201cSay it louder, for the people in the back.\u201d You stare at her arousal prominent in both of your eyes. \u201cGood girl!\u201d You say louder, voice hoarse from need. She hums, satisfied and let\u2019s go of your hair. \u201cNow, Y/N, why would your collar say that you are a good girl if you are not one? When really what you are is a desperate slut? A bad girl? Shall I get that changed? Hm?\u201d You squeeze your thighs together in an attempt to relieve some of the ache in your dripping pussy. She sees this action, laughs and proceeds to kick your legs apart. She grabs your chin roughly and tilts your head up. \u201cOpen.\u201d She says. You quickly open your mouth and stick out your tongue knowing what\u2019s coming. She spits in your mouth most of it falling on your tongue, your pussy contracts around nothing, you make a show of swallowing it for her. She gets down on one knee her hand trailing down your body and under your skirt. Her fingers rub your pussy over your panties before sliding them to the side and trailing her fingers through your slick. She lazily strokes your pussy from your entrance to the edge of your clit never really touching. Not where you most needed her. What a <i><b>fucking tease. </b></i>You grow desperate in need of release. \u201cDaddy please.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat princess? What is it you need?\u201d She smirks at you knowing <i><b>exactly</b></i> what you needed. You were going to give a smart ass remark but then remembered you two were not alone. You did not want to make it worse for yourself, you can be bratty in private. </p><p>\u201cDaddy please fuck me\u2026 I need you, please.\u201d You whimper desperate for anything really. Vers always had a way to make you yearn for her touch all the time. She grins with smug satisfaction whilst taking her hand off of your cunt. You open your mouth to say something and she immediately sticks her fingers in, \u201cSuck.\u201d You swirl your tongue around her middle and index fingers moaning at the taste of yourself. </p><p>\u201cOnly good girls get fucked by Daddy. Bad girls get punished.\u201d She forces her fingers further down your throat causing you to gag. \u201cLet\u2019s see what that mouth can do, hm?\u201d She removes her fingers from your mouth and points to her pelvis. Your eyes widen. Was she really going to make you do this in front of everyone? You grow increasingly frustrated, your juices rolling down your thighs. Skin sticky from sweat and arousal. She grabs your hair and roughly pushes your face into her crotch. \u201cDo not make me repeat myself, little girl.\u201d You moan as she grinds into your face the familiar feeling of her strap beneath her pants. She pulls your face away to give you room to unzip her pants. You work the strap out of the zippered part of her jeans and start moving your hand up and down all 6 inches. She pushes your head closer and taps the tip of her cock onto your lips. You open your mouth, sticking out your tongue, licking the tip and slowly taking it in. You look up at her and see the annoyance on her face. She smirks, gripping your hair tighter and thrusting all the way into your mouth making you gag. You relax your throat, breathing in through your nose, as she stills giving you time to adjust. She pulls out and slams back in once she knows you\u2019re okay. </p><p>\u201cLook at you, drooling on Daddy\u2019s cock. In front of all these people, you\u2019re enjoying this aren\u2019t you, slut?\u201d </p><p>You hum around her cock looking up with wide eyes. Her hips thrust at an animalistic pace, your eyes start to water, you put your hands on her thighs for some type of support. She stops thrusting, her cock buried in your throat. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s my name, little one?\u201d She pulls out, spit connecting in a string from your mouth to her cock. You wheeze catching your breath, her grip on your hair relentless.</p><p>\u201cDaddy. Your name is Daddy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHm that\u2019s right, baby girl, and who do you belong to?\u201d</p><p>You look up at her, eyes shining with love, admiration, and lust, \u201cYou, Daddy, I belong to you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d She says as she thrusts her cock back into your mouth. She holds it there, her other hand that is not in your hair coming up to pinch your nose closed. Your eyes widen, tears leaking out. You look up at Vers and you can\u2019t help but feel warmth in your soul, she\u2019s staring right back at you with that same fire in her eyes. <i><b>I love you.</b></i> She finally releases you, the strap glistening with your saliva. You want her to fuck you and she knows it. </p><p>\u201cSorry, little girl, this is a punishment which means you don\u2019t get to cum.\u201d She looks at you and  smirks, tapping your cheek lovingly. She puts her strap back inside her pants and readjusts herself. She walks over to the coat rack by the entrance and retrieves your leash. You stay kneeling, knowing better than to get up, not wanting another punishment. Vers returns and attaches the leash to your collar. You move to get up but she stops you, \u201cTsk tsk, little one, this is a punishment you get to crawl back home.\u201d She tugs on your leash once you\u2019re on your hands and knees, \u201cLet\u2019s go, slut, I\u2019m not done with you yet.\u201d You whimper, pussy clenching, god you couldn\u2019t wait to get home. You start to crawl next to Vers, all eyes on this spectacle and you couldn\u2019t be more proud to be owned by her.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your cheek, and your throat?\u201d Vers asks as she closed the door to your shared room. She pulls you close, hands on your waist, and examines your face.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, babe. You know I like it rough.\u201d You respond as you wrap your arms around her neck. She leans in and pecks you on the lips. </p><p>\u201cI know, I just hate doing that in public. I want you all to myself all the time,\u201d She pouts, \u201cI hate sharing.\u201d You smirk at her possessiveness, \u201cI\u2019ll try not to fuck up next time.\u201d You move to hover your lips near hers. She chuckles, \u201cAnd yet I find that hard to believe, baby girl.\u201d You laugh as well closing the distance and claiming her lips in a passionate kiss.</p>",

In private you could be a normal couple but in public, you had to follow the rules and sometimes you make a mistake.<br></p>[[MORE]]<p>You made the mistake of addressing her as her given name and not of what you\u2019re meant to call her in public. You could have called her Sir, Mistress, Master, or Daddy (which is both of your personal favorite.) But you had to go and fuck it up calling her Vers. Yon-Rogg happened to be present and he raised his hand to slap you when Vers grabbed his wrist and held on tightly. She was angry, glaring at him. I\u2019m sure she was also not too happy that she would have to publicly punish you as well. She\u2019s not too fond of punishing you publicly but she knows you get off on it. Being humiliated in front of so many people, letting them know who you belong to. Who <b><i>owns</i></b> you. </p><p>\u201cHow dare you raise a hand to my girl! <i><b>No one </b></i>touches her but me!\u201d </p><p>He rips his arm away from Vers and glares down at me, \u201cYou dare let her speak your name? Don\u2019t tell me she\u2019s made you soft, Vers?\u201d He taunts as his eyes snap back to hers. She huffs angrily and raises her hand.</p><p>Which is why you are suddenly on the floor after Vers slapped your cheek sending you to the ground holding your right cheek, a burning sensation heightened with the use of her powers.<br></p><p>She grabs you by your collar and pulls you to your knees. She looks down at you asking with her eyes if you were okay. You nod slightly, slick between your thighs. She knows what she\u2019s doing to you, she can smell your cunt already. She licks her lips and smirks down at you.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat does your collar say, babygirl?\u201d </p><p>You whimper and dart your eyes around to the crowd of people gathered near you. She bends down and grabs a fistful of your hair pulling back till you yelp and set your eyes on hers.</p><p>\u201cEyes on me, little one. They don\u2019t matter, I do. I asked a question. I expect an answer.\u201d</p><p>You swallow what moisture you had in your mouth, \u201cGood girl.\u201d You whisper. She huffs and tightens her grip on your hair. \u201cSay it louder, for the people in the back.\u201d You stare at her arousal prominent in both of your eyes. \u201cGood girl!\u201d You say louder, voice hoarse from need. She hums, satisfied and let\u2019s go of your hair. \u201cNow, Y/N, why would your collar say that you are a good girl if you are not one? When really what you are is a desperate slut? A bad girl? Shall I get that changed? Hm?\u201d You squeeze your thighs together in an attempt to relieve some of the ache in your dripping pussy. She sees this action, laughs and proceeds to kick your legs apart. She grabs your chin roughly and tilts your head up. \u201cOpen.\u201d She says. You quickly open your mouth and stick out your tongue knowing what\u2019s coming. She spits in your mouth most of it falling on your tongue, your pussy contracts around nothing, you make a show of swallowing it for her. She gets down on one knee her hand trailing down your body and under your skirt. Her fingers rub your pussy over your panties before sliding them to the side and trailing her fingers through your slick. She lazily strokes your pussy from your entrance to the edge of your clit never really touching. Not where you most needed her. What a <i><b>fucking tease. </b></i>You grow desperate in need of release. \u201cDaddy please.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat princess? What is it you need?\u201d She smirks at you knowing <i><b>exactly</b></i> what you needed. You were going to give a smart ass remark but then remembered you two were not alone. You did not want to make it worse for yourself, you can be bratty in private. </p><p>\u201cDaddy please fuck me\u2026 I need you, please.\u201d You whimper desperate for anything really. Vers always had a way to make you yearn for her touch all the time. She grins with smug satisfaction whilst taking her hand off of your cunt. You open your mouth to say something and she immediately sticks her fingers in, \u201cSuck.\u201d You swirl your tongue around her middle and index fingers moaning at the taste of yourself. </p><p>\u201cOnly good girls get fucked by Daddy. Bad girls get punished.\u201d She forces her fingers further down your throat causing you to gag. \u201cLet\u2019s see what that mouth can do, hm?\u201d She removes her fingers from your mouth and points to her pelvis. Your eyes widen. Was she really going to make you do this in front of everyone? You grow increasingly frustrated, your juices rolling down your thighs. Skin sticky from sweat and arousal. She grabs your hair and roughly pushes your face into her crotch. \u201cDo not make me repeat myself, little girl.\u201d You moan as she grinds into your face the familiar feeling of her strap beneath her pants. She pulls your face away to give you room to unzip her pants. You work the strap out of the zippered part of her jeans and start moving your hand up and down all 6 inches. She pushes your head closer and taps the tip of her cock onto your lips. You open your mouth, sticking out your tongue, licking the tip and slowly taking it in. You look up at her and see the annoyance on her face. She smirks, gripping your hair tighter and thrusting all the way into your mouth making you gag. You relax your throat, breathing in through your nose, as she stills giving you time to adjust. She pulls out and slams back in once she knows you\u2019re okay. </p><p>\u201cLook at you, drooling on Daddy\u2019s cock. In front of all these people, you\u2019re enjoying this aren\u2019t you, slut?\u201d </p><p>You hum around her cock looking up with wide eyes. Her hips thrust at an animalistic pace, your eyes start to water, you put your hands on her thighs for some type of support. She stops thrusting, her cock buried in your throat. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s my name, little one?\u201d She pulls out, spit connecting in a string from your mouth to her cock. You wheeze catching your breath, her grip on your hair relentless.</p><p>\u201cDaddy. Your name is Daddy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHm that\u2019s right, baby girl, and who do you belong to?\u201d</p><p>You look up at her, eyes shining with love, admiration, and lust, \u201cYou, Daddy, I belong to you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d She says as she thrusts her cock back into your mouth.

You want her to fuck you and she knows it. </p><p>\u201cSorry, little girl, this is a punishment which means you don\u2019t get to cum.\u201d She looks at you and  smirks, tapping your cheek lovingly. She puts her strap back inside her pants and readjusts herself. She walks over to the coat rack by the entrance and retrieves your leash. You stay kneeling, knowing better than to get up, not wanting another punishment. Vers returns and attaches the leash to your collar. You move to get up but she stops you, \u201cTsk tsk, little one, this is a punishment you get to crawl back home.\u201d She tugs on your leash once you\u2019re on your hands and knees, \u201cLet\u2019s go, slut, I\u2019m not done with you yet.\u201d You whimper, pussy clenching, god you couldn\u2019t wait to get home. You start to crawl next to Vers, all eyes on this spectacle and you couldn\u2019t be more proud to be owned by her.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your cheek, and your throat?\u201d Vers asks as she closed the door to your shared room. She pulls you close, hands on your waist, and examines your face.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, babe. You know I like it rough.\u201d You respond as you wrap your arms around her neck. She leans in and pecks you on the lips. </p><p>\u201cI know, I just hate doing that in public. I want you all to myself all the time,\u201d She pouts, \u201cI hate sharing.\u201d You smirk at her possessiveness, \u201cI\u2019ll try not to fuck up next time.\u201d You move to hover your lips near hers. She chuckles, \u201cAnd yet I find that hard to believe, baby girl.\u201d You laugh as well closing the distance and claiming her lips in a passionate kiss.</p>",

She was of high status in the ranks and you were given to her as a gift a few years back, which is tradition on Hala for commanding officers. She was given the right to choose who she wanted and she could not keep hers eyes off of you. You got lucky with Vers. She treated you like any other Kree, like you weren&rsquo;t a sex slave, only in the confines of your home. Unfortunately the rest of the population isn&rsquo;t accepting of slaves being treated as anything other than property. In private you could be a normal couple but in public, you had to follow the rules and sometimes you make a mistake.<br /></p><p>You made the mistake of addressing her as her given name and not of what you&rsquo;re meant to call her in public. You could have called her Sir, Mistress, Master, or Daddy (which is both of your personal favorite.) But you had to go and fuck it up calling her Vers. Yon-Rogg happened to be present and he raised his hand to slap you when Vers grabbed his wrist and held on tightly. She was angry, glaring at him. I&rsquo;m sure she was also not too happy that she would have to publicly punish you as well. She&rsquo;s not too fond of punishing you publicly but she knows you get off on it. Being humiliated in front of so many people, letting them know who you belong to. Who <b><i>owns</i></b> you. </p><p>&ldquo;How dare you raise a hand to my girl! <i><b>No one </b></i>touches her but me!&rdquo; </p><p>He rips his arm away from Vers and glares down at me, &ldquo;You dare let her speak your name? Don&rsquo;t tell me she&rsquo;s made you soft, Vers?&rdquo; He taunts as his eyes snap back to hers. She huffs angrily and raises her hand.</p><p>Which is why you are suddenly on the floor after Vers slapped your cheek sending you to the ground holding your right cheek, a burning sensation heightened with the use of her powers.<br /></p><p>She grabs you by your collar and pulls you to your knees. She looks down at you asking with her eyes if you were okay. You nod slightly, slick between your thighs. She knows what she&rsquo;s doing to you, she can smell your cunt already. She licks her lips and smirks down at you.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What does your collar say, babygirl?&rdquo; </p><p>You whimper and dart your eyes around to the crowd of people gathered near you. She bends down and grabs a fistful of your hair pulling back till you yelp and set your eyes on hers.</p><p>&ldquo;Eyes on me, little one. They don&rsquo;t matter, I do. I asked a question. I expect an answer.&rdquo;</p><p>You swallow what moisture you had in your mouth, &ldquo;Good girl.&rdquo; You whisper. She huffs and tightens her grip on your hair. &ldquo;Say it louder, for the people in the back.&rdquo; You stare at her arousal prominent in both of your eyes. &ldquo;Good girl!&rdquo; You say louder, voice hoarse from need. She hums, satisfied and let&rsquo;s go of your hair. &ldquo;Now, Y/N, why would your collar say that you are a good girl if you are not one? When really what you are is a desperate slut? A bad girl? Shall I get that changed? Hm?&rdquo; You squeeze your thighs together in an attempt to relieve some of the ache in your dripping pussy. She sees this action, laughs and proceeds to kick your legs apart. She grabs your chin roughly and tilts your head up. &ldquo;Open.&rdquo; She says. You quickly open your mouth and stick out your tongue knowing what&rsquo;s coming. She spits in your mouth most of it falling on your tongue, your pussy contracts around nothing, you make a show of swallowing it for her. She gets down on one knee her hand trailing down your body and under your skirt. Her fingers rub your pussy over your panties before sliding them to the side and trailing her fingers through your slick. She lazily strokes your pussy from your entrance to the edge of your clit never really touching. Not where you most needed her. What a <i><b>fucking tease. </b></i>You grow desperate in need of release. &ldquo;Daddy please.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What princess? What is it you need?&rdquo; She smirks at you knowing <i><b>exactly</b></i> what you needed. You were going to give a smart ass remark but then remembered you two were not alone. You did not want to make it worse for yourself, you can be bratty in private. </p><p>&ldquo;Daddy please fuck me&hellip; I need you, please.&rdquo; You whimper desperate for anything really. Vers always had a way to make you yearn for her touch all the time. She grins with smug satisfaction whilst taking her hand off of your cunt. You open your mouth to say something and she immediately sticks her fingers in, &ldquo;Suck.&rdquo; You swirl your tongue around her middle and index fingers moaning at the taste of yourself. </p><p>&ldquo;Only good girls get fucked by Daddy. Bad girls get punished.&rdquo; She forces her fingers further down your throat causing you to gag. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what that mouth can do, hm?&rdquo; She removes her fingers from your mouth and points to her pelvis. Your eyes widen. Was she really going to make you do this in front of everyone? You grow increasingly frustrated, your juices rolling down your thighs. Skin sticky from sweat and arousal. She grabs your hair and roughly pushes your face into her crotch. &ldquo;Do not make me repeat myself, little girl.&rdquo; You moan as she grinds into your face the familiar feeling of her strap beneath her pants. She pulls your face away to give you room to unzip her pants. You work the strap out of the zippered part of her jeans and start moving your hand up and down all 6 inches. She pushes your head closer and taps the tip of her cock onto your lips. You open your mouth, sticking out your tongue, licking the tip and slowly taking it in. You look up at her and see the annoyance on her face. She smirks, gripping your hair tighter and thrusting all the way into your mouth making you gag. You relax your throat, breathing in through your nose, as she stills giving you time to adjust. She pulls out and slams back in once she knows you&rsquo;re okay. </p><p>&ldquo;Look at you, drooling on Daddy&rsquo;s cock. In front of all these people, you&rsquo;re enjoying this aren&rsquo;t you, slut?&rdquo; </p><p>You hum around her cock looking up with wide eyes. Her hips thrust at an animalistic pace, your eyes start to water, you put your hands on her thighs for some type of support. She stops thrusting, her cock buried in your throat. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s my name, little one?&rdquo; She pulls out, spit connecting in a string from your mouth to her cock. You wheeze catching your breath, her grip on your hair relentless.</p><p>&ldquo;Daddy. Your name is Daddy.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hm that&rsquo;s right, baby girl, and who do you belong to?&rdquo;</p><p>You look up at her, eyes shining with love, admiration, and lust, &ldquo;You, Daddy, I belong to you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Good girl.&rdquo; She says as she thrusts her cock back into your mouth. She holds it there, her other hand that is not in your hair coming up to pinch your nose closed. Your eyes widen, tears leaking out. You look up at Vers and you can&rsquo;t help but feel warmth in your soul, she&rsquo;s staring right back at you with that same fire in her eyes. <i><b>I love you.</b></i> She finally releases you, the strap glistening with your saliva.
