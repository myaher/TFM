Still others might find that a combination prescription drugs, therapy and self-help strategies is most effective. In other words, there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all. </p> <p>Vancouver\u2019s Mia Kelly has lived with the condition since her late teens, trying various forms of talk therapy, including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), to little beneficial effect for years. She worried about things to the extreme, avoided many social situations, and experienced symptoms like sweating and rapid heartbeat more often than not. </p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until she was in her early 30s that she started taking medication for her chronic anxiety. Along with regular exercise, she noticed a significant change. </p> <p>\u201cI wish I would have started taking medication sooner,\u201d says Kelly, now 49. \u201cWorking out is a huge part of my mental health, but I feel far more stable. A lot of people say you should be able to deal with it with counselling or that it\u2019s a cop-out to take medication, but my anxiety was so severe that that [counselling] just wasn\u2019t cutting it.\u201d<br></p> <p><em><strong>ALSO SEE:\u00a0<a href=\"https://ca.style.yahoo.com/what-should-you-do-if-you-think-you-have-anxiety-012515151.html\">What should you do if you think you have anxiety?</a></strong></em></p> <p>Jennifer Ho has also struggled with anxiety, experiencing panic attacks when she felt especially overwhelmed. Rather than take medication, the 40-year-old Vancouver resident manages her symptoms through a variety of other techniques. One is cognitive-behavioural therapy, which is a psychological approach that helps people think about themselves and perceived problems in different ways. She does breathing exercises, meditates, and has an essential-oil diffuser at home to disperse soothing scents like lavender; she also finds acupuncture helpful.</p> <p>\u201cIt takes effort to keep my anxiety in check, but I feel like I can manage it,\u201d Ho says. </p> <p>Health professionals emphasize that treating anxiety is a highly individualized process. It often takes a combination of CBT, medication, physical activity, and self-help strategies like mindfulness (where you focus on breathing so that you can be aware of and in the present moment) to effectively manage the condition. </p> <p>\u201cA lot of people benefit from CBT,\u201d says Fardous Hosseiny, national director of research and public policy at the Canadian Mental Health Association. \u201cIt teaches you how to manage thoughts, feelings, and behaviours\u2014all of these elements work together. It helps you to change any unhelpful patterns in your thinking that can feed anxious thoughts.\u201d</p> <p>Several types of medication can be used to treat anxiety. They include benzodiazepines and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, better known as anti-depressants).</p> <p>\u201cThere could be a physical cause for anxiety, an imbalance in brain chemistry where it\u2019s necessary to have medications involved,\u201d Hosseiny says. \u201cSome people need medication; that\u2019s part of their therapy. If it can be combined with other forms of therapy or self-management tools, even better. </p> <p>\u201cWhatever you need to get better is what we would advocate for,\u201d he adds. \u201cSome people can\u2019t survive without medication and they need it. It\u2019s our job as an organization to advocate on behalf of people with lived experience regardless of what form of treatment is involved.\u201d</p> <p>The caveat when it comes to medication, he says, is the potential for dependency, which is why having other forms of therapy is so important. Medication can also have a range of side effects, from diminished sex drive to nausea. </p> <p>However, taking medication for anxiety shouldn\u2019t be judged negatively. \u201cWe don\u2019t shame someone who takes medication for diabetes,\u201d Hosseiny says. \u201cWe need that parity lens. Mental health should be looked upon in the same light as physical health, or we\u2019ll never get rid of the stigma.\u201d </p> <p>Cameron McIntyre, a doctor of naturopathic medicine in North Vancouver, says that there are multiple ways to treat anxiety without medication, but that it\u2019s sometimes necessary. \u201cThere are serious conditions and times and places where medication is required, no question,\u201d says McIntyre, who works out of the Restoration Health Clinic. \u201cI\u2019m not averse to that at all. But it\u2019s important to address the underlying causes for why they\u2019re in this state.\u201d</p> <p><strong><em>ALSO SEE:\u00a0<a href=\"https://ca.style.yahoo.com/anxiety-takes-heavy-financial-toll-canadians-economy-143918844.html\">Anxiety takes heavy financial toll on Canadians, economy</a></em></strong></p> <p>Causes of anxiety are individual and multifactorial. It plays havoc with stress, McIntyre says, and leads to the release of cortisol, a stress hormone.</p> <p>\u201cWhen cortisol becomes dysregulated over time, that can throw a monkey wrench into lots of systems, not the least of which is sleep,\u201d he says. \u201cSo much of our ability of function in the course our day depends on how well we\u2019ve slept the night before.\u201d </p> <p>Managing blood sugar is another way to help manage anxiety, since extreme highs and lows affects adrenaline levels, adding fuel to the fire. \u201cIf you\u2019re already prone to anxiousness, and you\u2019re having a yo-yo of your blood sugar, you\u2019re going to have more adrenaline in your system, which is just adding fuel to the fire,\u201d McIntyre says. \u201cMaking sure good sources of protein are being consumed, making sure good fats are being consumed, allows us to avoid the yo-yo.\u201d</p> <p>Spending time in nature can have dramatic effects on reducing anxiety. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s lots of research coming out about what our body chemistry does in states of nature and how beneficial that is for us,\u201d McIntyre says. \u201cYou\u2019ve probably heard the term \u2018forest bathing\u2019. Doctors are now writing prescriptions for people to get out and walk in the trees, to experience that nature connection. There\u2019s has a whole host of beneficial effects; there\u2019s an endorphin release and calming of the nervous system when we\u2019re communing with nature.\u201d</p> <p>Other approaches people can incorporate into their daily life to address anxiousness include yoga and breath work. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been shown that 10 deep breaths will bring the body and mind out of a state of anxiousness and into a calmer state,\u201d McIntyre says. \u201cDancing, a nice bubble bath, anything that brings joy [can help]. We get so used to being in \u2018go\u2019 mode, and I\u2019ve seen so many people where anxiety is their default state because they\u2019re going 100 iles an hour and their brains don\u2019t know any different anymore. So it\u2019 all bout engaging in activities that reteach the brain and the body how to relax.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>ALSO SEE:\u00a0<a href=\"https://ca.style.yahoo.com/open-letter-no-thing-anxiety-depression-father-said-044649459.html\">Open letter: \u2018There is NO such thing as anxiety or depression. Why? My father said so\u2019</a></strong></em></p> <p>Certain supplements can help. Magnesium helps calm the nervous system; one way to get magnesium is via Epsom salts. Vitamin C can be beneficial too: \u201cThe more stress we experience, the more vitamin C we burn,\u201d McIntyre says. \u201cOften, anxiety and stress lead to a poor immune function.\u201d </p> <p>Research also points to the benefits of essential oils and how the scents of various plants send signals to the brain to relax. Using a diffuser is one way to breathe them in; so is putting a couple of drops in bath water or on your pillow. </p> <p>Reducing the amount of time spent on electronic devices is also crucial for anyone who experiences anxiety. </p> <p>\u201cScreens are massively going to be shown to be significantly detrimental to brain health and particularly to brain energy,\u201d McIntyre says. \u201cThey are high in blue light. It does two things: it lowers mitochondrial function, which is the battery power in all the cells in our body, and it keeps the brain in beta state, which is hyper alert. This is and will become a larger factor in the health of us all as we move forward with electronics.
