Lyanna with the Rebellion and Nymeria with having to find a safe place for all her people and marrying a stranger to keep the peace. Lyanna and Nymeria represent two sides, one chose love and the other chose duty, but both had to sacrifice.&nbsp;</p><p>Arya&rsquo;s endgame shouldn&rsquo;t reflect anyone&rsquo;s that came before her. She is her own person and she&rsquo;s carving out her own path. Her endgame should be something we haven&rsquo;t seen before: a marriage for love that&rsquo;s <i>successful. </i>They&nbsp;mostly end in tragedy in ASOIAF tbh, and I want her to break that cycle.&nbsp;</p><p>I agree that she&rsquo;s a liminal - she belongs to the highborn and the lowborn. She belongs to the old and new world. But I don&rsquo;t see that as a prison, but a position to be a catalyst for great change. She has the unique ability to bring Westeros forward, and a self-sacrificial arranged marriage would be a step back. She&rsquo;s sacrificed enough already, no one should ask her to do so again at the very end.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, there&rsquo;s no reason why whoever she marries for love <i>can&rsquo;t </i>be good for House Stark too. It might be ideal politically, but the point is that she&rsquo;s not marrying him for that, but because her heart wants to. That&rsquo;s pretty sweet to me.&nbsp;</p><p>I love the detailed asks! Really, I&rsquo;ve missed talking about Arya like this and I really appreciate you coming to me for a discussion! So thank you so much, you fantastic person!&nbsp;&#10084;&#65039;</p></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><i>\n\nIn a sense Ned&rsquo;s death is liberating to Arya bc she can fully realize all those things she wanted to do uninhibited by the restrictions placed upon her by birth. She consorts with whoever, gets to be whoever she wants albeit by necessity, but in her heart she&rsquo;s still a lord&rsquo;s daughter, that&rsquo;s why I think in reclaiming her identity she&rsquo;ll have to pick up that mantle of responsibility she always chafed against. That&rsquo;s what her fc training should help her for to be two ppl at once cont..\n\n<br /></i></p>\n<p><i>\n\nArya Underfoot in her heart but Arya of House Stark outwordly. This could just be my own envisioning, but I&rsquo;ve always wanted her to become over time less associated with Lyanna and more like Nymeria. With the interplay of revenge, mercy, duty in her arc it would be more poignant conclusion for her imo to marry out of a grand self sacrificial impulse, like saving her people. Sorry for the detailed ask, ur one of my fav bloggers and it&rsquo;s great to have a back and forth with a fellow stan.&nbsp;</i></p>\n</blockquote>\n</p>",

Sansa sided against her family in support of the Lannisters. <br /></p><p>GRRM&rsquo;s story was originally about three Starks - Arya, Bran and Jon, a Lannister - Tyrion and a Targaryen - Dany. It&rsquo;s now expanded to include more characters but he&rsquo;s telling the stories of these houses through these characters and it&rsquo;s not the other way around. It&rsquo;s not going to matter which house is on top or on the bottom, only which characters making it out alive. He is telling a story of characters that has little bits of him in there:</p><blockquote><p>\n<b>Jon Snow has me in him, and Sam \nTarly. </b>The women too, Lyanna<b> </b>and Shaara<b>, and the girls, Arya </b>and Adara <b>&hellip;\n Daenerys Stormborn, searching for that house with the red door. And \nTyrion Lannister? Oh, yes. The Imp is me in spades, the horny little \nbastard.&rdquo; </b>-<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.asimovs.com%2F_issue_0410%2Ftheheartofasmall.shtml&amp;t=ZGJkMGI2OGViNzU5ZWJjOGY1NTJhMTMzYjkyOTAwOTg4ZWViMDJmMyxKNFpNV1RsdA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ANpwGUoZHEBALgYXfzBlWeg&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fdonewithwoodenteeth.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F75528221224%2Fdo-you-have-a-list-of-grrm-quotes-about-arya-i&amp;m=1\">GRRM</a>\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>Will Dany find the house with the red door? Will Jon finally unite with his beloved sibling? Can Arya find peace and love again? What is going to happen to that horny little bastard at the end of this story? <br /></p><p>It&rsquo;s only fandom and the media (advertisement/HBO) that makes it about houses at the end of the day. <br /></p>",

        "body": "<p>Settle down folks, cause we\u2019re here today to talk about Arya Stark\u2019s most undervalued skill. Cause yeah, she\u2019s a warrior and has a sharp mind and a sharp tongue and she stands up for injustice. All very good things. But one trait that we rarely discuss (partially because it\u2019s depicted more in the books than the show and partially because this is an undervalued skill in general) is this: My girl is scary good at making friends.</p><p>Like, shit man, Arya is just good at making all kinds of people like her. And I really do mean ALL kinds. There are lots of examples of this in the book, but for those who say that D&amp;D deleted this aspect of her character in the show: Oh, contrair. Let\u2019s look at the colorful cast of characters that Arya somehow manages to befriend (This is show focused but feel free to add book characters)</p><p>First up, we got Micah. Precious Micah. Gone before your time. But he\u2019s an odd friend for a noble girl to have because he\u2019s the son of a butcher in a town where they\u2019re just stopping by for like&hellip;a day. Arya apparently scurries off and immediately befriends this total stranger and gets him to help her practice with a sword. And even though they only know each other for a day, his murder is enough to get the Hound on her kill list! Because she geuinely cares about and values this boy even though it would have been so easy for her to dismiss her.</p><p>Then we\u2019ve got Syrio. I mean yes, Syrio was hired by her father but the guy does go out of his way to comfort her AND let us not forget, he is willing to sacrifice his life to help her. That\u2019s not something you do for a girl that you don\u2019t really like.</p><p>Arya befriends Gendry, Hotpie and Lommy as well. Even though Hotpie and Lommy start off my picking on Arya by season two, they\u2019re having casual conversations and by the end of their journey, Hotpie bakes her a wolf bread! And welcomes her back in season 7! Also, Arya puts Polliver on her list partially because of killing Lommy. Clearly she usually only holds grudges when necessary or she wouldn\u2019t have been so bent on seeking justice for this boy. And with Gendry, well, I don\u2019t need to say much about that. Everyone else has said plenty about them. But suffice it to say that a poor bastard black smith is a strange friend for a high born girl to have.</p><p>She befriends Jaqen H\u2019ghar because she helps him out of a jam, even though she could have left him to die, and because of it, she earns his help and a coin that gets her to Bravos. You think he offers that internship to everyone? No chance.\u00a0</p><p>She befriends the Brotherhood, even though they kidnap and plan to randsom her, getting the archer to teach her how to shoot and even having a heartfelt conversation with Berric Dondarian, another man who makes it on her list.</p><p>She befriends the Hound, one of the first ever names on her list, and he tells her about his burning trauma and helps her away from the Red Wedding. Sure, we could say he\u2019s trying to ransom her, but he clearly likes the girl even when she\u2019s THREATENING him MULTIPLE TIMES.</p><p>She befriends many people in Bravos just by wandering the docks and learning about them. She befriends Lady Crane to the point that woman takes her in and heals her even though they\u2019ve only had one short interaction. And if you think that there was no\u00a0\u2018Arya the friend making genius\u2019 in season 7? Wrong! How about that conversation with the random Lannister soldiers? Makes friends with them too and has a good laugh.\u00a0</p><p>But honestly, I think the greatest testement to Arya\u2019s way with people is a show only addition to season two when she becomes cup bearer to Tywin fucking Lannister. Like, Jesus, my girl Arya somehow gets him to tell her about his daddy issues? Also he compares her to his daughter and talks about history with her? Its the warmest we ever see Tywin except maybe his scene with Tommen after Joffrey\u2019s death. And even then, Tywin is partially trying to manipulate Tommen into listening to him. With Arya, he doesn\u2019t need her for anything. He thinks she\u2019s some random girl. They still end up having MULTIPLE positive interactions.</p><p>So Arya befriends just about everyone she meets and those people, from Micah to Tywin Lannister, seem to like her. Why is that?</p><p>1) She doesn\u2019t care about background. Arya treats most people based on their deeds NOT where they come from. If you earn a spot on her list, its cause you fucked up real bad. But she even is willing to chat with people from her list if she needs to.</p><p>2) She\u2019s a good listener. People are just&hellip;drawn to tell her shit. And she doesn\u2019t use it as ammo or gossip later. She just kinda has that vibe that you could tell her anything and it won\u2019t get back to your enemies.</p><p>3) She is strong willed but kind. Despite the terrible treatment she got in season seven by the writers, Arya is not cruel without purpose. She says what is on her mind and she calls people out but she also often gives people the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>4) She really genuinely cares about people. Like, she is ride or die if she\u2019s known you for even a brief time and you seem like a good person. And she\u2019ll kill for you! A proper friend.</p><p>5) I dunno, some mystical powers that caused Tywin Lannister to be sort of nice for 2.5 seconds.</p><p>Her skill at this is there in the show. It\u2019s just underutilized and not often talked about. But Arya\u2019s people skills is part of her character that makes her so loveable! And I think we should acknowledge it more.</p>",

Cause yeah, she\u2019s a warrior and has a sharp mind and a sharp tongue and she stands up for injustice. All very good things. But one trait that we rarely discuss (partially because it\u2019s depicted more in the books than the show and partially because this is an undervalued skill in general) is this: My girl is scary good at making friends.</p><p>Like, shit man, Arya is just good at making all kinds of people like her. And I really do mean ALL kinds. There are lots of examples of this in the book, but for those who say that D&amp;D deleted this aspect of her character in the show: Oh, contrair. Let\u2019s look at the colorful cast of characters that Arya somehow manages to befriend (This is show focused but feel free to add book characters)</p><p>First up, we got Micah. Precious Micah. Gone before your time. But he\u2019s an odd friend for a noble girl to have because he\u2019s the son of a butcher in a town where they\u2019re just stopping by for like\u2026a day. Arya apparently scurries off and immediately befriends this total stranger and gets him to help her practice with a sword. And even though they only know each other for a day, his murder is enough to get the Hound on her kill list! Because she geuinely cares about and values this boy even though it would have been so easy for her to dismiss her.</p><p>Then we\u2019ve got Syrio. I mean yes, Syrio was hired by her father but the guy does go out of his way to comfort her AND let us not forget, he is willing to sacrifice his life to help her. That\u2019s not something you do for a girl that you don\u2019t really like.</p><p>Arya befriends Gendry, Hotpie and Lommy as well. Even though Hotpie and Lommy start off my picking on Arya by season two, they\u2019re having casual conversations and by the end of their journey, Hotpie bakes her a wolf bread! And welcomes her back in season 7! Also, Arya puts Polliver on her list partially because of killing Lommy. Clearly she usually only holds grudges when necessary or she wouldn\u2019t have been so bent on seeking justice for this boy. And with Gendry, well, I don\u2019t need to say much about that. Everyone else has said plenty about them. But suffice it to say that a poor bastard black smith is a strange friend for a high born girl to have.</p><p>She befriends Jaqen H\u2019ghar because she helps him out of a jam, even though she could have left him to die, and because of it, she earns his help and a coin that gets her to Bravos. You think he offers that internship to everyone? No chance.\u00a0</p><p>She befriends the Brotherhood, even though they kidnap and plan to randsom her, getting the archer to teach her how to shoot and even having a heartfelt conversation with Berric Dondarian, another man who makes it on her list.</p><p>She befriends the Hound, one of the first ever names on her list, and he tells her about his burning trauma and helps her away from the Red Wedding. Sure, we could say he\u2019s trying to ransom her, but he clearly likes the girl even when she\u2019s THREATENING him MULTIPLE TIMES.</p><p>She befriends many people in Bravos just by wandering the docks and learning about them. She befriends Lady Crane to the point that woman takes her in and heals her even though they\u2019ve only had one short interaction. And if you think that there was no\u00a0\u2018Arya the friend making genius\u2019 in season 7? Wrong! How about that conversation with the random Lannister soldiers? Makes friends with them too and has a good laugh.\u00a0</p><p>But honestly, I think the greatest testement to Arya\u2019s way with people is a show only addition to season two when she becomes cup bearer to Tywin fucking Lannister. Like, Jesus, my girl Arya somehow gets him to tell her about his daddy issues? Also he compares her to his daughter and talks about history with her? Its the warmest we ever see Tywin except maybe his scene with Tommen after Joffrey\u2019s death. And even then, Tywin is partially trying to manipulate Tommen into listening to him. With Arya, he doesn\u2019t need her for anything. He thinks she\u2019s some random girl. They still end up having MULTIPLE positive interactions.</p><p>So Arya befriends just about everyone she meets and those people, from Micah to Tywin Lannister, seem to like her. Why is that?</p><p>1) She doesn\u2019t care about background. Arya treats most people based on their deeds NOT where they come from. If you earn a spot on her list, its cause you fucked up real bad. But she even is willing to chat with people from her list if she needs to.</p><p>2) She\u2019s a good listener. People are just\u2026drawn to tell her shit. And she doesn\u2019t use it as ammo or gossip later. She just kinda has that vibe that you could tell her anything and it won\u2019t get back to your enemies.</p><p>3) She is strong willed but kind. Despite the terrible treatment she got in season seven by the writers, Arya is not cruel without purpose. She says what is on her mind and she calls people out but she also often gives people the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>4) She really genuinely cares about people. Like, she is ride or die if she\u2019s known you for even a brief time and you seem like a good person. And she\u2019ll kill for you! A proper friend.</p><p>5) I dunno, some mystical powers that caused Tywin Lannister to be sort of nice for 2.5 seconds.</p><p>Her skill at this is there in the show.
