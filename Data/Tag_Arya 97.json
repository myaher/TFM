She was always on the run from someone trying to kill her and most of the time didn\u2019t even know if she\u2019d be able to get food and water or shelter.\u00a0</p><p>Just as Sansa has been making her dreams come true on her own terms, Arya deserves the same.

Catelyn has tried (and mostly failed) to transform Arya into a princess, but she\u2019s still been spending most of her time with Gendry. This would be just prior to a battle with the Lannisters in which Gendry is supposed to join, but Arya is not.</b></p><p>Gendry swallowed dryly as he watched Arya approach; his mind raced, trying to find the right words. But what was there to say other than he didn\u2019t know how he could physically walk out of this castle thinking he might never see her again? And with her lady mother and brother of a king present, he very well couldn\u2019t say it all like that.</p><p>She looked lovely, the icy blue of her gown standing in stark contrast to her storm gray eyes. He could never tell her that either.</p><p>When she reached him, her mouth was drawn tightly as she surveyed him for the first time in full armor. Not his own, but armor all the same. Her eyes, however, held a jest.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Arya said lightly, \u201cdo take care.\u201d Then she reached out a hand and patted his upper arm. Thinking she meant to hug him, he reached out his arms, but she turned swiftly to hug her brother and kiss him on the cheek before sweeping back the way she\u2019d come.</p><p><br/></p><p>Even Catelyn looked after her in shock. Despite their best efforts to keep Arya in her chambers and away from the forge all those past months, all present had expected a much warmer farewell from the northern princess for the blacksmith she was overly too fond of.</p><p><br/></p><p>Stupidly, Gendry finally lowered his arms. His elbow still burned from where she\u2019d touched it.

                "content": "<p><h1>where you go, i go</h1><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;quote&quot;}\"><b>AU where the Brotherhood makes it to Riverrun with Arya, and Gendry stays with her and joins her brother&rsquo;s fight. Catelyn has tried (and mostly failed) to transform Arya into a princess, but she&rsquo;s still been spending most of her time with Gendry. This would be just prior to a battle with the Lannisters in which Gendry is supposed to join, but Arya is not.</b></p><p>Gendry swallowed dryly as he watched Arya approach; his mind raced, trying to find the right words. But what was there to say other than he didn&rsquo;t know how he could physically walk out of this castle thinking he might never see her again? And with her lady mother and brother of a king present, he very well couldn&rsquo;t say it all like that.</p><p>She looked lovely, the icy blue of her gown standing in stark contrast to her storm gray eyes. He could never tell her that either.</p><p>When she reached him, her mouth was drawn tightly as she surveyed him for the first time in full armor. Not his own, but armor all the same. Her eyes, however, held a jest.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Arya said lightly, &ldquo;do take care.&rdquo; Then she reached out a hand and patted his upper arm. Thinking she meant to hug him, he reached out his arms, but she turned swiftly to hug her brother and kiss him on the cheek before sweeping back the way she&rsquo;d come.</p><p><br /></p><p>Even Catelyn looked after her in shock. Despite their best efforts to keep Arya in her chambers and away from the forge all those past months, all present had expected a much warmer farewell from the northern princess for the blacksmith she was overly too fond of.</p><p><br /></p><p>Stupidly, Gendry finally lowered his arms. His elbow still burned from where she&rsquo;d touched it. His faced burned now too, and surrounded by virtual strangers as he was, he couldn&rsquo;t express the way he truly felt about her shortness.</p><p><br /></p><p>Instead, after waiting for Robb to kiss Catelyn&rsquo;s hand, he fell into step with Robb, who waited until they were out of his mother&rsquo;s hearing to murmur, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s just upset she can&rsquo;t be there.&rdquo; Robb&rsquo;s attempt at making him feel better for the slight. But she hadn&rsquo;t looked upset in the least, and they both knew it. Though Gendry knew Arya <i>had</i> fought her king tooth and nail to be allowed to join them.</p><p><br /></p><p>Gendry knew now they had made a mistake coming here, though it was useless to think about because Arya never would have been swayed from it. But out there, even in the middle of the war, no matter what they had been facing, they had always been together. The fear Gendry felt in his chest was not from the battle; he couldn&rsquo;t even think on it. It was the fear of never seeing Arya again, whatever that meant.</p><p><br /></p><p>The only thought he had to truly console him was that if the battle did take a turn for the worst, Arya would be warm and safe in her bed. This gave Gendry the resolve to stride faster towards war, to mount his horse and ride.</p><p><br /></p><p>Later, they&rsquo;d made camp not far from the Lannisters and would wait until dawn to mount an attack. Distracted by his thoughts of Arya, he made a half-assed attempt at a fire that wouldn&rsquo;t take.</p><p><br /></p><p>He was distracted now by the thought of what he would say to Arya if he ever <i>did</i> see her again. So distracted he began practicing the conversation out loud.&ldquo;M&rsquo;lady,&rdquo; he started, his hand extended. He dropped his hand and shook his head. &ldquo;Stupid.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Then- &ldquo;Arya&hellip;&rdquo; Here, he stopped again, her name in his mouth feeling forbidden but somehow right at the same time.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Arry,&rdquo; he tried, but it only made him sad, flooding his mind with memories of their time with Yoren, at Harrenhall and with the Brotherhood.</p><p><br /></p><p>His shoulders sagged and he gave up the impromptu rehearsal. &ldquo;I just thought you cared.&rdquo; He finished to himself dejectedly.</p><p><br /></p><p>A rustle of leaves to his left shocked him from his stupor, and he scrambled to pick up his hammer and swiftly turn. He managed to stop the hammer within an inch of Arya&rsquo;s sword. But <i>she</i> was smiling wildly. &ldquo;Cared about what?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Gendry&rsquo;s breath caught at the sight of her. Not only was she there but she was dressed like a boy again. Gendry hadn&rsquo;t seen her dressed like this for many moons. It had been all dresses and slippers and fancy braids. Her hair, which had grown shoulder length, was tied behind her head and hidden under a helm. On top of all of it though, it was getting harder and harder to disguise that she was really a woman, no matter how ugly the breeches, no matter how big the boots.</p><p>Of course this had been her plan all along. How had he not seen it?</p><p><br /></p><p>And was this why she had been so flippant?</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Cat got your tongue?&rdquo; She asked playfully, letting her sword rest against his still lifted hammer with a clang.</p><p><br /></p><p>Gendry let the hammer lower, grinding it noisily against the metal of her sword. &ldquo;Stupid.&rdquo; He said, finally managing to tear his gaze away from her.</p><p><br /></p><p>She glanced at him questioningly as she sheathed Needle. &ldquo;Why are you stupid?&rdquo; The irresistible grin was back.</p><p>&ldquo;You actually expect anyone to believe you&rsquo;re a boy?&rdquo; Gendry finally settled for stubbornly.</p><p><br /></p><p>Arya ignored that. &ldquo;You mean stupid for thinking I would let you leave without saying goodbye?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>As she spoke she sat at the hastily made fire and worked on it until it was blazing.
