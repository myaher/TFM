I love the Snufkin from the earlier show, but I relate to and I\u2019m very interested in the way they portray this Snufkin. He is voiced by Edvin Endre, who himself explained he did not want to imitate the former and gave the character a more youthful voice (Snufkin and Moomintroll are explicitly teenagers in this version). I\u2019ve seen some people questioning what is his accent\u2013he\u2019s Swedish (fitting, as the Moomins\u2019 creator Tove Jansson was a Swedish-speaking Finn and the story itself takes place somewhere around Sweden and Finland).</p><p>Snufkin is a calm philosophical wanderer who enjoys his own solitude, nature and playing and expressing himself through his harmonica. He\u2019s an expert at living in nature, prefers to have very little material possessions and values freedom. In turn, he hates controlling authority figures and rules. He is greatly admired for his independence and wisdom, especially by small forest critters who don\u2019t have much self-confidence of their own. After he befriended the Moomins, he stays in Moominvalley but always leaves south during winter and returns in spring when the Moomins wake up from hibernation. Him being able to go and leave how he pleases is extremely important for him, though his best friend Moomintroll always misses him greatly as a result.</p><p>With all these characteristics, Snufkin is generally considered the \u2019cool\u2019 character, both by the viewers and the other characters. However, he does hide some insecurities of his own, and one adaptation is explored in great detail in this 2019 version. According to Edvin, Snufkin has always identified with solitude and he is conflicted between being attached to Moominvalley (especially Moomintroll) and being on his own. Notably, he doesn\u2019t seem that close to the other cast in this version, with Moominpappa (who is not the most delicate with words) calling him an \u2019odd fellow\u2019 and \u2019antisocial\u2019. I\u2019ve also noticed that this Snufkin is not above getting some slapstick and silly moments.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c39f696a424cf838891474c0689b7a08/tumblr_inline_psqzoltWpL1sjf0lz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"/></figure><p>In the second episode where he is introduced, we learn a lot. Snufkin is returning to Moominvalley as always, but this time he\u2019s late and has a hard time creating his yearly spring tune. He is frustrated and imagines a pile of snow as Moomintroll, explaining to him he\u2019s not ready to come back yet and apologising that he can\u2019t think of him right now. He gets more and more frustrated when he notices he\u2019s followed by one of those admiring forest critters and grumpily tells him to leave, as he cannot create music when he\u2019s being watched. But the overly talkative creature comes closer anyway and fanboys over Snufkin, who gets really uncomfortable and says you can never be free if you admire someone too much, a feeling he himself knows.</p><p>Both figuratively and literally the critter gets too close for comfort, asking Snufkin to give him a name (apparently, the creature is considered so insignificant he doesn\u2019t have one) and talking about how much Moomintroll always misses Snufkin and how close the two are. While he has tried to be nice and control his anger (quite poorly, but still), Snufkin lashes out and says he goes when it suits him and maybe he doesn\u2019t go at all. The sad critter attempts to leave, but Snufkin quickly feels bad and gives him an unique name-Teety-Woo. Teety-Woo is overjoyed, feeling he now has an identity, and quickly leaves when Snufkin isn\u2019t looking. Realizing he is all alone, Snufkin suddenly gets sad and starts to feel massive loneliness, and looks for Teety-Woo in vain. He feels so alone, he feels it\u2019s not like him and he must be ill.</p><p>Afterwards, he has a nightmare where he wakes up and continues to move towards Moominvalley, getting more and more desperate, even when he loses his beloved harmonica and a bunch of branches and roots try to grab and restrain him (SYMBOLISM). He smiles in relief when he sees the Moominhouse and a light in Moomintroll\u2019s room. He walks past a hedgehog, who suddenly talks to him and mocks him, telling him there\u2019s no point to come back because he\u2019s been gone so long no one remembers him anymore. Snufkin is bothered by this, but gets even more determined to reach Moomintroll and climbs the ladder to his window. But much to his surprise, he sees Moomintroll has \u2018replaced\u2019 him and is happily playing with Teety-Woo. Snufkin is so shocked he falls down the ladder and wakes up from the nightmare shouting for help. He meets Teety-Woo again in friendly terms, confirms that the critter hasn\u2019t actually went to Moominvalley and admits he really wants to see Moomintroll and finally creates his spring tune. You\u2019d expect a very emotional reunion after all of this, but instead Snufkin acts very cool and restrained and formal, not telling Moomintroll about his worries nor giving a hug Moomintroll clearly wanted.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"447\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5b2f2eb34fcadf04a799191b72e8af42/tumblr_inline_psqzq1FqvV1sjf0lz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"447\"/></figure><p>Another part I found interesting and very relatable as someone who gets anxious during parties; some time later, Snufkin is in a party with Moomintroll, likely invited by him, but despite smiling doesn\u2019t seem comfortable. According to him, he doesn\u2019t dislike people, but he sometimes feels trapped in social situations and needs to be alone for some time. When Moomintroll leaves to refill their drinks, Snufkin instantly gets visibly uncomfortable looking at the people around him and anxiously grasps his hands. When Moomintroll returns, Snufkin has left without a word, feeling too overwhelmed to stay any longer. He feels guilty and assures he will go back when telling this story to Little My (it\u2019s very sweet to me that he feels relaxed hanging with Little My of all people and tells her about his feelings, which could be foreshadowing the possibility that they\u2019re half-siblings like in the original stories). Long story short, Snufkin gets into a conflict with a park keeper after he bumps into his fence and regulation signs while trying to relax in the nature. Due to a misunderstanding, Moomintroll and Snorkmaiden are blamed for his vandalism and get locked in jail, making him feel even more guilty. He attempts to rescue them and then takes their place in jail as he confirms they\u2019re innocent (and Snufkin obviously really isn\u2019t a fan of being locked up or bossed around by police). Moomintroll comes up with a plan to get him out quicker which at first seems like a great punishment. Snufkin doesn\u2019t realize Moomintroll\u2019s plan at first and believed Moomintroll was truly angry with him, and genuinely felt \u2019it\u2019s all he deserves\u2019 after leaving Moomintroll at the party (ouch).</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"628\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/808864e06fd0d7abe56658e5988b45d3/tumblr_inline_psqzqpNxKz1sjf0lz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"628\"/></figure><p>Snufkin can be too distant and Moomintroll can be too dependant, but the narrative never treats either of them as the bad guy for it.

I love the Snufkin from the earlier show, but I relate to and I\u2019m very interested in the way they portray this Snufkin. He is voiced by Edvin Endre, who himself explained he did not want to imitate the former and gave the character a more youthful voice (Snufkin and Moomintroll are explicitly teenagers in this version). I\u2019ve seen some people questioning what is his accent\u2013he\u2019s Swedish (fitting, as the Moomins\u2019 creator Tove Jansson was a Swedish-speaking Finn and the story itself takes place somewhere around Sweden and Finland).</p><p>Snufkin is a calm philosophical wanderer who enjoys his own solitude, nature and playing and expressing himself through his harmonica. He\u2019s an expert at living in nature, prefers to have very little material possessions and values freedom. In turn, he hates controlling authority figures and rules. He is greatly admired for his independence and wisdom, especially by small forest critters who don\u2019t have much self-confidence of their own. After he befriended the Moomins, he stays in Moominvalley but always leaves south during winter and returns in spring when the Moomins wake up from hibernation. Him being able to go and leave how he pleases is extremely important for him, though his best friend Moomintroll always misses him greatly as a result.</p><p>With all these characteristics, Snufkin is generally considered the \u2019cool\u2019 character, both by the viewers and the other characters. However, he does hide some insecurities of his own, and one adaptation is explored in great detail in this 2019 version. According to Edvin, Snufkin has always identified with solitude and he is conflicted between being attached to Moominvalley (especially Moomintroll) and being on his own. Notably, he doesn\u2019t seem that close to the other cast in this version, with Moominpappa (who is not the most delicate with words) calling him an \u2019odd fellow\u2019 and \u2019antisocial\u2019. I\u2019ve also noticed that this Snufkin is not above getting some slapstick and silly moments.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c39f696a424cf838891474c0689b7a08/tumblr_inline_psqzoltWpL1sjf0lz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"></figure><p>In the second episode where he is introduced, we learn a lot. Snufkin is returning to Moominvalley as always, but this time he\u2019s late and has a hard time creating his yearly spring tune. He is frustrated and imagines a pile of snow as Moomintroll, explaining to him he\u2019s not ready to come back yet and apologising that he can\u2019t think of him right now. He gets more and more frustrated when he notices he\u2019s followed by one of those admiring forest critters and grumpily tells him to leave, as he cannot create music when he\u2019s being watched. But the overly talkative creature comes closer anyway and fanboys over Snufkin, who gets really uncomfortable and says you can never be free if you admire someone too much, a feeling he himself knows.</p><p>Both figuratively and literally the critter gets too close for comfort, asking Snufkin to give him a name (apparently, the creature is considered so insignificant he doesn\u2019t have one) and talking about how much Moomintroll always misses Snufkin and how close the two are. While he has tried to be nice and control his anger (quite poorly, but still), Snufkin lashes out and says he goes when it suits him and maybe he doesn\u2019t go at all. The sad critter attempts to leave, but Snufkin quickly feels bad and gives him an unique name-Teety-Woo. Teety-Woo is overjoyed, feeling he now has an identity, and quickly leaves when Snufkin isn\u2019t looking. Realizing he is all alone, Snufkin suddenly gets sad and starts to feel massive loneliness, and looks for Teety-Woo in vain. He feels so alone, he feels it\u2019s not like him and he must be ill.</p><p>Afterwards, he has a nightmare where he wakes up and continues to move towards Moominvalley, getting more and more desperate, even when he loses his beloved harmonica and a bunch of branches and roots try to grab and restrain him (SYMBOLISM). He smiles in relief when he sees the Moominhouse and a light in Moomintroll\u2019s room. He walks past a hedgehog, who suddenly talks to him and mocks him, telling him there\u2019s no point to come back because he\u2019s been gone so long no one remembers him anymore. Snufkin is bothered by this, but gets even more determined to reach Moomintroll and climbs the ladder to his window. But much to his surprise, he sees Moomintroll has \u2018replaced\u2019 him and is happily playing with Teety-Woo. Snufkin is so shocked he falls down the ladder and wakes up from the nightmare shouting for help. He meets Teety-Woo again in friendly terms, confirms that the critter hasn\u2019t actually went to Moominvalley and admits he really wants to see Moomintroll and finally creates his spring tune. You\u2019d expect a very emotional reunion after all of this, but instead Snufkin acts very cool and restrained and formal, not telling Moomintroll about his worries nor giving a hug Moomintroll clearly wanted.<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"447\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5b2f2eb34fcadf04a799191b72e8af42/tumblr_inline_psqzq1FqvV1sjf0lz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"447\"></figure><p>Another part I found interesting and very relatable as someone who gets anxious during parties; some time later, Snufkin is in a party with Moomintroll, likely invited by him, but despite smiling doesn\u2019t seem comfortable.

When Moomintroll returns, Snufkin has left without a word, feeling too overwhelmed to stay any longer. He feels guilty and assures he will go back when telling this story to Little My (it\u2019s very sweet to me that he feels relaxed hanging with Little My of all people and tells her about his feelings, which could be foreshadowing the possibility that they\u2019re half-siblings like in the original stories). Long story short, Snufkin gets into a conflict with a park keeper after he bumps into his fence and regulation signs while trying to relax in the nature.

He attempts to rescue them and then takes their place in jail as he confirms they\u2019re innocent (and Snufkin obviously really isn\u2019t a fan of being locked up or bossed around by police). Moomintroll comes up with a plan to get him out quicker which at first seems like a great punishment.
