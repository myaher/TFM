Warning for some mild pain play on top of the pet play stuff!<br/></p><p><i>Teaser:</i><br/>\u201cYou like that?\u201d Dan whispers.</p><p>There\u2019s a suggestion in his voice that still feels new. The small lilt at the end of the phrase asking covertly for more than just a lazy fuck before bed. It\u2019s asking for that other side of their sex life now, and even though the logistics may not stray far from what they normally do it offers a completely different mindset. A mindset that only the suggestion of serves to make Phil grow bone hard between his legs.</p><hr><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/18399653\" target=\"_blank\"><b>[read on ao3]</b></a> or read here under the cut!<br/></p><!-- more --><p>Saturday night means a bowl of popcorn \neach and a film they\u2019ve put up watching for too long. It means no \nYouTube thoughts are allowed, a rule which is more about Phil than Dan \ncurrently. It is difficult to follow, despite the easy distraction these\n pure indulgences grant.</p><p>They\u2019re lying on one end each of their \nlarge sofa. Dan is wrapped up in a heavy brown blanket. His eyes squint \nat the telly. He\u2019s too tired to focus clearly. Under normal \ncircumstances Phil would already be asleep. He would have been woken up \nwhen the film was over and pulled to bed with Dan, practically forced to\n stand upright.</p><p>But the fuzzy pink blanket that is draped over \nPhil right now feels restricting rather than comforting. He can\u2019t focus \non the film either. His thoughts keep drifting and his heart keeps \nclenching.</p><p>YouTube isn\u2019t getting under Phil\u2019s skin currently. He \ngets anxious about it, but he isn\u2019t losing sleep over it. That is a \nmassive improvement from only a few months ago. Right now, Phil doesn\u2019t \nknow the cause for his racing heart. Unfocused yet alert, the worst \ncombination which he unfortunately knows intimately.</p><p>A blanket-covered toe pushes against Phil\u2019s foot, where his and Dan\u2019s feet meet in the corner of the sofa.</p><p>\u201cOi,\u201d Dan says, sounding more awake than Phil expected.</p><p>\u201cOi yourself,\u201d Phil says back.</p><p>He kicks at Dan\u2019s foot playfully. They end up swatting loosely at each other, all the while looking down on their own feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d Phil giggles.</p><p>\u201cYou were fidgeting,\u201d Dan says.</p><p>He stops kicking and instead strokes the pad of his left foot along the back of Phil\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Phil says. \u201cI\u2019m anxious for no reason.\u201d</p><p>Phil\n looks away from their feet and up at Dan\u2019s face. So far away on the \nother end of the couch, but the presence in his eyes makes him feel like\n he\u2019s much closer. Dan gives a small smile.</p><p>\u201cCome here?\u201d he suggests.</p><p>Phil\n immediately discards his own blanket and crawls on top of Dan. Their \nknees knock together and Dan makes a noise at Phil\u2019s unlevelled weight \non top of him. Phil grins, but rubs a hand on Dan\u2019s arm as apology \nbefore he settles behind him. He grabs a pillow and fits it under his \nhead. Once he relaxes, one arm casually resting on top of Dan\u2019s waist, \nDan wriggles back to slot himself against Phil\u2019s chest. Dan grabs his \nblanket and throws it back to share with Phil, and the warmth in their \nsmall shared space spreads out between them. It only takes a few moments\n before their breathing match and for their individual temperatures to \nbecome one. Phil still doesn\u2019t focus on the film, but he feels the \nanxiety start to fade as his eyelids grow heavy.</p><p>Phil plays with \nthe soft fabric of Dan\u2019s t-shirt. His eyes are still resting on the \nscreen but in his mind, his focus is entirely on how the material feels \nbetween his fingers. He lets his hand flatten on top, and feels the \ncreases even out beneath it. He pushes it tight between his thumb and \nforefinger, and he rolls it rhythmically.</p><p>He\u2019s barely aware that \nhe\u2019s doing it despite focusing in on it. It isn\u2019t until Dan\u2019s breaths \ncome out longer, slower, that Phil remembers that he\u2019s actively rubbing \nDan\u2019s chest and stomach as if he\u2019s got intentions beyond that.</p><p>Phil\n revels in the feeling. He pushes his face against the back of Dan\u2019s \nneck and breathes in deep. The exhale comes out long and warm. Phil can \nfeel Dan prickle underneath it.</p><p>\u201cPhil,\u201d Dan sighs, almost turning into a whine.</p><p>Phil\n smiles as he presses his lips onto the skin. Dan\u2019s reactions are \ndelicious, and they\u2019re enough to elicit an excitement that shakes Phil \nout of sleepiness.</p><p>He scratches his nails softly on top of the \nmaterial of Dan\u2019s shirt and scratches his teeth over the side of Dan\u2019s \nneck. Dan simply takes hold of Phil\u2019s hand and pushes it downward. He \nholds it firm on top of his crotch, makes Phil\u2019s fingers squeeze on his \nswelling cock. Phil feels his own fill at the sensation, now acutely \naware of how Dan\u2019s ass feels against it. Soft yet firm in all the right \nplaces. If Phil shifted only slightly his dick would fit snugly between \nhis cheeks.</p><p>\u201cYou like that?\u201d Dan whispers.</p><p>There\u2019s a \nsuggestion in his voice that still feels new. The small lilt at the end \nof the phrase asking covertly for more than just a lazy fuck before bed.\n It\u2019s asking for that other side of their sex life now, and even though \nthe logistics may not stray far from what they normally do it offers a \ncompletely different mindset. A mindset that only the suggestion of \nserves to make Phil grow bone hard between his legs.</p><p>Phil scratches his teeth just the smallest bit harder over Dan\u2019s skin, and huffs his breath out in response.</p><p>\u201cGood boy,\u201d Dan says.</p><p>Phil\n pushes Dan\u2019\u2019s sweatpants down to his knees and wraps his hand around \nDan\u2019s cock. The soft hitches of breath makes Phil\u2019s head swim with want.\n </p><p>He wants to be a good boy.</p><p>Dan isn\u2019t playing any games. He\n pushes his ass against Phil with purpose and arches to fit himself up \nat the base of Phil\u2019s stomach. Completely offering himself up to rut and\n hump against. Phil breathes out hard as he pulls his dick out. He spits\n on his hand and squeezes over it, a lazy kind of lubrication but the \nsudden hurry in both of them seems pressing.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you want this, don\u2019t you?\u201d Dan asks as Phil manages a experimental hump against him. \u201cWanna come on me like a good pup?\u201d</p><p>Phil\n slots his cock between Dan\u2019s cheeks and pushes up. The slide goes \nsmooth, smoother than he expected without better lubrication. Dan feels \nso perfectly soft around him, and Phil feels his heart beat harder as he\n dares go into rhythm.</p><p>With one hand clutched tight on Dan\u2019s hip \nbone he lets his instincts take over, in that way they only do when \nthere\u2019s this extra layer on top of it all. Phil would love to push \ninside, stretch Dan wide around him and make him take it, but there\u2019s no\n time. Dan arches harder and Phil\u2019s cock is trapped between Dan\u2019s ass \ncheeks. There\u2019s really nothing more and nothing less he wants right now.</p><p>They\n stay in position for a few moments, Phil breathing hard against Dan\u2019s \nneck as he humps slowly. Every stroke of his cock and every pull of his \nforeskin feels like explosions behind his eyelids. If he goes any faster\n this will be over in only moments.</p><p>\u201cGod, yes,\u201d Dan groans, \npushing harder against Phil and stretching his neck to give access to \nmore of it. \u201cFuck me like that. Good boy.\u201d</p><p>Phil leans into the \nwords, to the feeling, and pushes a thigh up next to Dan\u2019s. He topples \nthem over as his knee sinks down onto the sofa with the weight, and he \nwaits for a moment to hear any protests. He\u2019s actively trapping Dan \nunder him, and Phil knows damn well that that\u2019s not something Dan wants \nall the time. But in this scenario, with Phil grunting and rutting \nagainst him all it does is make Dan let out an almost embarrassingly \ngenuine noise of pleasure at the changed position.</p><p>\u201cPhil,\u201d Dan breathes, \u201cmake me take it.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s all it takes for Phil to really give into his own desires.</p><p>He\n rolls Dan\u2019s shirt up and Dan shifts underneath him to pull it off of \nhim. Phil pushes his other knee up, and effectively pushes Dan onto his \nstomach. He\u2019s really taking all the power in the moment. Dan keens. Phil\n can\u2019t help moaning as they fall into place. He pushes his chest against\n Dan\u2019s back and bites down on his shoulder as he fucks against him. \nHuffing breaths and pathetic whines escape his lips for every thrust.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Dan pants, voice coming muffled where his mouth is pressed against the sofa cushion. \u201cGood boy.\u201d</p><p>Phil\n feels how heavy he must be on him, how completely he\u2019s taking all \ncontrol. For a moment it makes him hesitate. He licks a comforting \nstripe on Dan\u2019s shoulder as his hips slow their previously unforgiving \npace.</p><p>\u201cIs it okay?\u201d Phil whispers almost incoherently. \u201cDoes it feel good?\u201d</p><p>He\n feels Dan\u2019s muscles tighten where he keeps licking smoothly over his \nskin. It\u2019s a delicious feeling, knowing that that small action causes \nsuch a deep reaction.</p><p>\u201cDoes it feel good?\u201d Dan mimics with a small laugh.</p><p>Phil\n grounds his hips back down at that, pushing all his weight on him with \nsuch force that something in the sofa creaks. Phil can\u2019t help but \nshudder at the sensation, how tightly his dick is trapped between Dan\u2019s \ncheeks and how willingly Dan gives his body up for him.</p><p>\u201cGod yes,\u201d Dan moans on an inhale, \u201c<i>harder.</i>\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s\n all he needs to say for Phil to go into a frantic pace. He moans into \nDan\u2019s ear as he keeps him trapped under him, fingers digging bruises \nbetween his ribs and knees pressed hard into his waist. Dan moves just \nas frantically under him, giving exactly enough friction for Phil to \nknow he could come at any moment.</p><p>He still holds back, begging \nthis to last longer. He bites back down on Dan\u2019s shoulder as he feels \nhimself shudder, inching closer and closer, the approaching sensations \nalready curling his toes.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re gonna come for me?\u201d Dan spits out between moans.</p><p>Phil simply whines in response, cock so perfectly snug and impossibly hard. He\u2019s so, so fucking close.</p><p>\u201cUgh, yes, I\u2019m gonna come,\u201d Phil hears himself moan in a voice he can barely recognise himself.</p><p>\u201cMmh,\u201d Dan moans. \u201cCome on me, puppy.\u201d</p><p>That\n word, paired with the risky feeling when the head of Phil\u2019s cock \nmomentarily catches at Dan\u2019s rim, is what causes him to shake and curse \nloudly as he blows his load on the small of Dan\u2019s back.</p><p>Phil moves\n with the aftermath, the few seconds of perfection that the come down \ngives, and it\u2019s within that time frame that he feels Dan go rock solid \nunderneath him as he tenses hard and then goes impossibly soft as he \ncomes. The choked off sounds as Dan bites his long moan into the sofa \ncushion makes Phil\u2019s cock twitch despite how completely spent it is.</p><p>\u201cPhil,\u201d Dan breathes out in awe. \u201cGod, <i>Phil</i>.\u201d</p><p>Phil\n unhooks his knee from trapping Dan. Dan turns around to face him, and \nfor a moment all Phil can do is look. At the reddened zig zag across his\n bare chest where the print from the cushion has pressed into it. At the\n already reddening handprints on the sides of his ribcage. Phil feels a \nstrange mix of pride and guilt looking at the result of his actions.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna bruise,\u201d Phil finds himself saying.</p><p>He\u2019s sitting up on Dan\u2019s thighs as he lets his fingers feel the indentations on Dan\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Dan replies.</p><p>Phil\n looks up at his eyes and there\u2019s nothing but satisfaction rolling from \nDan\u2019s unwavering gaze. His face is still a bit red and his eyes are \nwatery. Seeing him like this in any other context would be frightening. \nDan\u2019s hands cover Phil\u2019s on his chest, tugging them up to his neck and \nmaking them wrap around loosely.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d Dan repeats himself.</p><p>Phil\n leans down. His lips meet Dan\u2019s half open mouth and he revels in a kiss\n that seems odd in its intimacy knowing that he\u2019s just willingly caused \nDan pain.</p><p>Once he pulls back, and they\u2019ve settled to lying side by side on the sofa, Dan traces a finger over Phil\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I want,\u201d Dan murmurs. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I need my puppy to do to me.\u201d</p><p>Phil\n bites down on his bottom lip and huffs a noise. There\u2019s a thrill in \nthose words, paired with something that, although dull, feels a bit \nsharp. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d Phil asks, because he has to.</p><p>Everything\n they do together, they share. Dan\u2019s pleasure is Phil\u2019s and vice versa. \nIt almost scares him to know that this is something Dan likes, but Phil \nwouldn\u2019t if their positions were switched. Still, knowing Dan will \nbruise creates sparks inside. Previously it\u2019s all been bites and the \noccasional hickey, an unspoken thing they both allow and enjoy. Now it \nseems like more.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dan answers, and their eyes meet.</p><p>Phil\n would guess Dan\u2019s are asking for more. For something deeper, something \nharder. He finds himself wanting to give him that, not just for Dan\u2019s \npleasure but his own.</p><p>\u201cNext time,\u201d Dan says as he shifts closer, lips almost touching, \u201cI want my puppy not to hold back anything.\u201d</p><p>Phil nods, staring at those glistening brown eyes that won\u2019t betray a single syllable spoken.</p><p>They seal it with a kiss, soft and slow. And yet next time they fuck, they\u2019ll do the exact opposite. Phil can\u2019t wait.</p>",

It means no \nYouTube thoughts are allowed, a rule which is more about Phil than Dan \ncurrently. It is difficult to follow, despite the easy distraction these\n pure indulgences grant.</p><p>They\u2019re lying on one end each of their \nlarge sofa. Dan is wrapped up in a heavy brown blanket. His eyes squint \nat the telly. He\u2019s too tired to focus clearly. Under normal \ncircumstances Phil would already be asleep. He would have been woken up \nwhen the film was over and pulled to bed with Dan, practically forced to\n stand upright.</p><p>But the fuzzy pink blanket that is draped over \nPhil right now feels restricting rather than comforting. He can\u2019t focus \non the film either. His thoughts keep drifting and his heart keeps \nclenching.</p><p>YouTube isn\u2019t getting under Phil\u2019s skin currently. He \ngets anxious about it, but he isn\u2019t losing sleep over it. That is a \nmassive improvement from only a few months ago. Right now, Phil doesn\u2019t \nknow the cause for his racing heart. Unfocused yet alert, the worst \ncombination which he unfortunately knows intimately.</p><p>A blanket-covered toe pushes against Phil\u2019s foot, where his and Dan\u2019s feet meet in the corner of the sofa.</p><p>\u201cOi,\u201d Dan says, sounding more awake than Phil expected.</p><p>\u201cOi yourself,\u201d Phil says back.</p><p>He kicks at Dan\u2019s foot playfully. They end up swatting loosely at each other, all the while looking down on their own feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d Phil giggles.</p><p>\u201cYou were fidgeting,\u201d Dan says.</p><p>He stops kicking and instead strokes the pad of his left foot along the back of Phil\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Phil says. \u201cI\u2019m anxious for no reason.\u201d</p><p>Phil\n looks away from their feet and up at Dan\u2019s face. So far away on the \nother end of the couch, but the presence in his eyes makes him feel like\n he\u2019s much closer. Dan gives a small smile.</p><p>\u201cCome here?\u201d he suggests.</p><p>Phil\n immediately discards his own blanket and crawls on top of Dan.

It means no \nYouTube thoughts are allowed, a rule which is more about Phil than Dan \ncurrently. It is difficult to follow, despite the easy distraction these\n pure indulgences grant.</p><p>They\u2019re lying on one end each of their \nlarge sofa. Dan is wrapped up in a heavy brown blanket. His eyes squint \nat the telly. He\u2019s too tired to focus clearly. Under normal \ncircumstances Phil would already be asleep. He would have been woken up \nwhen the film was over and pulled to bed with Dan, practically forced to\n stand upright.</p><p>But the fuzzy pink blanket that is draped over \nPhil right now feels restricting rather than comforting. He can\u2019t focus \non the film either. His thoughts keep drifting and his heart keeps \nclenching.</p><p>YouTube isn\u2019t getting under Phil\u2019s skin currently. He \ngets anxious about it, but he isn\u2019t losing sleep over it. That is a \nmassive improvement from only a few months ago. Right now, Phil doesn\u2019t \nknow the cause for his racing heart. Unfocused yet alert, the worst \ncombination which he unfortunately knows intimately.</p><p>A blanket-covered toe pushes against Phil\u2019s foot, where his and Dan\u2019s feet meet in the corner of the sofa.</p><p>\u201cOi,\u201d Dan says, sounding more awake than Phil expected.</p><p>\u201cOi yourself,\u201d Phil says back.</p><p>He kicks at Dan\u2019s foot playfully. They end up swatting loosely at each other, all the while looking down on their own feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d Phil giggles.</p><p>\u201cYou were fidgeting,\u201d Dan says.</p><p>He stops kicking and instead strokes the pad of his left foot along the back of Phil\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Phil says. \u201cI\u2019m anxious for no reason.\u201d</p><p>Phil\n looks away from their feet and up at Dan\u2019s face. So far away on the \nother end of the couch, but the presence in his eyes makes him feel like\n he\u2019s much closer. Dan gives a small smile.</p><p>\u201cCome here?\u201d he suggests.</p><p>Phil\n immediately discards his own blanket and crawls on top of Dan. Their \nknees knock together and Dan makes a noise at Phil\u2019s unlevelled weight \non top of him. Phil grins, but rubs a hand on Dan\u2019s arm as apology \nbefore he settles behind him. He grabs a pillow and fits it under his \nhead. Once he relaxes, one arm casually resting on top of Dan\u2019s waist, \nDan wriggles back to slot himself against Phil\u2019s chest. Dan grabs his \nblanket and throws it back to share with Phil, and the warmth in their \nsmall shared space spreads out between them. It only takes a few moments\n before their breathing match and for their individual temperatures to \nbecome one. Phil still doesn\u2019t focus on the film, but he feels the \nanxiety start to fade as his eyelids grow heavy.</p><p>Phil plays with \nthe soft fabric of Dan\u2019s t-shirt. His eyes are still resting on the \nscreen but in his mind, his focus is entirely on how the material feels \nbetween his fingers. He lets his hand flatten on top, and feels the \ncreases even out beneath it. He pushes it tight between his thumb and \nforefinger, and he rolls it rhythmically.</p><p>He\u2019s barely aware that \nhe\u2019s doing it despite focusing in on it. It isn\u2019t until Dan\u2019s breaths \ncome out longer, slower, that Phil remembers that he\u2019s actively rubbing \nDan\u2019s chest and stomach as if he\u2019s got intentions beyond that.</p><p>Phil\n revels in the feeling. He pushes his face against the back of Dan\u2019s \nneck and breathes in deep. The exhale comes out long and warm. Phil can \nfeel Dan prickle underneath it.</p><p>\u201cPhil,\u201d Dan sighs, almost turning into a whine.</p><p>Phil\n smiles as he presses his lips onto the skin. Dan\u2019s reactions are \ndelicious, and they\u2019re enough to elicit an excitement that shakes Phil \nout of sleepiness.</p><p>He scratches his nails softly on top of the \nmaterial of Dan\u2019s shirt and scratches his teeth over the side of Dan\u2019s \nneck. Dan simply takes hold of Phil\u2019s hand and pushes it downward. He \nholds it firm on top of his crotch, makes Phil\u2019s fingers squeeze on his \nswelling cock. Phil feels his own fill at the sensation, now acutely \naware of how Dan\u2019s ass feels against it. Soft yet firm in all the right \nplaces. If Phil shifted only slightly his dick would fit snugly between \nhis cheeks.</p><p>\u201cYou like that?\u201d Dan whispers.</p><p>There\u2019s a \nsuggestion in his voice that still feels new. The small lilt at the end \nof the phrase asking covertly for more than just a lazy fuck before bed.\n It\u2019s asking for that other side of their sex life now, and even though \nthe logistics may not stray far from what they normally do it offers a \ncompletely different mindset. A mindset that only the suggestion of \nserves to make Phil grow bone hard between his legs.</p><p>Phil scratches his teeth just the smallest bit harder over Dan\u2019s skin, and huffs his breath out in response.</p><p>\u201cGood boy,\u201d Dan says.</p><p>Phil\n pushes Dan\u2019\u2019s sweatpants down to his knees and wraps his hand around \nDan\u2019s cock. The soft hitches of breath makes Phil\u2019s head swim with want.\n </p><p>He wants to be a good boy.</p><p>Dan isn\u2019t playing any games. He\n pushes his ass against Phil with purpose and arches to fit himself up \nat the base of Phil\u2019s stomach. Completely offering himself up to rut and\n hump against. Phil breathes out hard as he pulls his dick out. He spits\n on his hand and squeezes over it, a lazy kind of lubrication but the \nsudden hurry in both of them seems pressing.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you want this, don\u2019t you?\u201d Dan asks as Phil manages a experimental hump against him. \u201cWanna come on me like a good pup?\u201d</p><p>Phil\n slots his cock between Dan\u2019s cheeks and pushes up. The slide goes \nsmooth, smoother than he expected without better lubrication. Dan feels \nso perfectly soft around him, and Phil feels his heart beat harder as he\n dares go into rhythm.</p><p>With one hand clutched tight on Dan\u2019s hip \nbone he lets his instincts take over, in that way they only do when \nthere\u2019s this extra layer on top of it all. Phil would love to push \ninside, stretch Dan wide around him and make him take it, but there\u2019s no\n time. Dan arches harder and Phil\u2019s cock is trapped between Dan\u2019s ass \ncheeks. There\u2019s really nothing more and nothing less he wants right now.</p><p>They\n stay in position for a few moments, Phil breathing hard against Dan\u2019s \nneck as he humps slowly. Every stroke of his cock and every pull of his \nforeskin feels like explosions behind his eyelids. If he goes any faster\n this will be over in only moments.</p><p>\u201cGod, yes,\u201d Dan groans, \npushing harder against Phil and stretching his neck to give access to \nmore of it. \u201cFuck me like that. Good boy.\u201d</p><p>Phil leans into the \nwords, to the feeling, and pushes a thigh up next to Dan\u2019s. He topples \nthem over as his knee sinks down onto the sofa with the weight, and he \nwaits for a moment to hear any protests. He\u2019s actively trapping Dan \nunder him, and Phil knows damn well that that\u2019s not something Dan wants \nall the time. But in this scenario, with Phil grunting and rutting \nagainst him all it does is make Dan let out an almost embarrassingly \ngenuine noise of pleasure at the changed position.</p><p>\u201cPhil,\u201d Dan breathes, \u201cmake me take it.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s all it takes for Phil to really give into his own desires.</p><p>He\n rolls Dan\u2019s shirt up and Dan shifts underneath him to pull it off of \nhim. Phil pushes his other knee up, and effectively pushes Dan onto his \nstomach. He\u2019s really taking all the power in the moment. Dan keens. Phil\n can\u2019t help moaning as they fall into place. He pushes his chest against\n Dan\u2019s back and bites down on his shoulder as he fucks against him. \nHuffing breaths and pathetic whines escape his lips for every thrust.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Dan pants, voice coming muffled where his mouth is pressed against the sofa cushion. \u201cGood boy.\u201d</p><p>Phil\n feels how heavy he must be on him, how completely he\u2019s taking all \ncontrol. For a moment it makes him hesitate. He licks a comforting \nstripe on Dan\u2019s shoulder as his hips slow their previously unforgiving \npace.</p><p>\u201cIs it okay?\u201d Phil whispers almost incoherently. \u201cDoes it feel good?\u201d</p><p>He\n feels Dan\u2019s muscles tighten where he keeps licking smoothly over his \nskin. It\u2019s a delicious feeling, knowing that that small action causes \nsuch a deep reaction.</p><p>\u201cDoes it feel good?\u201d Dan mimics with a small laugh.</p><p>Phil\n grounds his hips back down at that, pushing all his weight on him with \nsuch force that something in the sofa creaks. Phil can\u2019t help but \nshudder at the sensation, how tightly his dick is trapped between Dan\u2019s \ncheeks and how willingly Dan gives his body up for him.</p><p>\u201cGod yes,\u201d Dan moans on an inhale, \u201c<i>harder.</i>\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s\n all he needs to say for Phil to go into a frantic pace. He moans into \nDan\u2019s ear as he keeps him trapped under him, fingers digging bruises \nbetween his ribs and knees pressed hard into his waist. Dan moves just \nas frantically under him, giving exactly enough friction for Phil to \nknow he could come at any moment.</p><p>He still holds back, begging \nthis to last longer. He bites back down on Dan\u2019s shoulder as he feels \nhimself shudder, inching closer and closer, the approaching sensations \nalready curling his toes.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re gonna come for me?\u201d Dan spits out between moans.</p><p>Phil simply whines in response, cock so perfectly snug and impossibly hard. He\u2019s so, so fucking close.</p><p>\u201cUgh, yes, I\u2019m gonna come,\u201d Phil hears himself moan in a voice he can barely recognise himself.</p><p>\u201cMmh,\u201d Dan moans. \u201cCome on me, puppy.\u201d</p><p>That\n word, paired with the risky feeling when the head of Phil\u2019s cock \nmomentarily catches at Dan\u2019s rim, is what causes him to shake and curse \nloudly as he blows his load on the small of Dan\u2019s back.</p><p>Phil moves\n with the aftermath, the few seconds of perfection that the come down \ngives, and it\u2019s within that time frame that he feels Dan go rock solid \nunderneath him as he tenses hard and then goes impossibly soft as he \ncomes. The choked off sounds as Dan bites his long moan into the sofa \ncushion makes Phil\u2019s cock twitch despite how completely spent it is.</p><p>\u201cPhil,\u201d Dan breathes out in awe. \u201cGod, <i>Phil</i>.\u201d</p><p>Phil\n unhooks his knee from trapping Dan. Dan turns around to face him, and \nfor a moment all Phil can do is look. At the reddened zig zag across his\n bare chest where the print from the cushion has pressed into it. At the\n already reddening handprints on the sides of his ribcage. Phil feels a \nstrange mix of pride and guilt looking at the result of his actions.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna bruise,\u201d Phil finds himself saying.</p><p>He\u2019s sitting up on Dan\u2019s thighs as he lets his fingers feel the indentations on Dan\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Dan replies.</p><p>Phil\n looks up at his eyes and there\u2019s nothing but satisfaction rolling from \nDan\u2019s unwavering gaze. His face is still a bit red and his eyes are \nwatery.

His lips meet Dan\u2019s half open mouth and he revels in a kiss\n that seems odd in its intimacy knowing that he\u2019s just willingly caused \nDan pain.</p><p>Once he pulls back, and they\u2019ve settled to lying side by side on the sofa, Dan traces a finger over Phil\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I want,\u201d Dan murmurs. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I need my puppy to do to me.\u201d</p><p>Phil\n bites down on his bottom lip and huffs a noise.

Phil can \nfeel Dan prickle underneath it.</p><p>&ldquo;Phil,&rdquo; Dan sighs, almost turning into a whine.</p><p>Phil\n smiles as he presses his lips onto the skin. Dan&rsquo;s reactions are \ndelicious, and they&rsquo;re enough to elicit an excitement that shakes Phil \nout of sleepiness.</p><p>He scratches his nails softly on top of the \nmaterial of Dan&rsquo;s shirt and scratches his teeth over the side of Dan&rsquo;s \nneck. Dan simply takes hold of Phil&rsquo;s hand and pushes it downward. He \nholds it firm on top of his crotch, makes Phil&rsquo;s fingers squeeze on his \nswelling cock. Phil feels his own fill at the sensation, now acutely \naware of how Dan&rsquo;s ass feels against it. Soft yet firm in all the right \nplaces. If Phil shifted only slightly his dick would fit snugly between \nhis cheeks.</p><p>&ldquo;You like that?&rdquo; Dan whispers.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a \nsuggestion in his voice that still feels new. The small lilt at the end \nof the phrase asking covertly for more than just a lazy fuck before bed.\n It&rsquo;s asking for that other side of their sex life now, and even though \nthe logistics may not stray far from what they normally do it offers a \ncompletely different mindset. A mindset that only the suggestion of \nserves to make Phil grow bone hard between his legs.</p><p>Phil scratches his teeth just the smallest bit harder over Dan&rsquo;s skin, and huffs his breath out in response.</p><p>&ldquo;Good boy,&rdquo; Dan says.</p><p>Phil\n pushes Dan&rsquo;&rsquo;s sweatpants down to his knees and wraps his hand around \nDan&rsquo;s cock. The soft hitches of breath makes Phil&rsquo;s head swim with want.\n </p><p>He wants to be a good boy.</p><p>Dan isn&rsquo;t playing any games. He\n pushes his ass against Phil with purpose and arches to fit himself up \nat the base of Phil&rsquo;s stomach. Completely offering himself up to rut and\n hump against. Phil breathes out hard as he pulls his dick out. He spits\n on his hand and squeezes over it, a lazy kind of lubrication but the \nsudden hurry in both of them seems pressing.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, you want this, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Dan asks as Phil manages a experimental hump against him. &ldquo;Wanna come on me like a good pup?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil\n slots his cock between Dan&rsquo;s cheeks and pushes up. The slide goes \nsmooth, smoother than he expected without better lubrication. Dan feels \nso perfectly soft around him, and Phil feels his heart beat harder as he\n dares go into rhythm.</p><p>With one hand clutched tight on Dan&rsquo;s hip \nbone he lets his instincts take over, in that way they only do when \nthere&rsquo;s this extra layer on top of it all. Phil would love to push \ninside, stretch Dan wide around him and make him take it, but there&rsquo;s no\n time. Dan arches harder and Phil&rsquo;s cock is trapped between Dan&rsquo;s ass \ncheeks. There&rsquo;s really nothing more and nothing less he wants right now.</p><p>They\n stay in position for a few moments, Phil breathing hard against Dan&rsquo;s \nneck as he humps slowly. Every stroke of his cock and every pull of his \nforeskin feels like explosions behind his eyelids. If he goes any faster\n this will be over in only moments.</p><p>&ldquo;God, yes,&rdquo; Dan groans, \npushing harder against Phil and stretching his neck to give access to \nmore of it. &ldquo;Fuck me like that. Good boy.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil leans into the \nwords, to the feeling, and pushes a thigh up next to Dan&rsquo;s. He topples \nthem over as his knee sinks down onto the sofa with the weight, and he \nwaits for a moment to hear any protests. He&rsquo;s actively trapping Dan \nunder him, and Phil knows damn well that that&rsquo;s not something Dan wants \nall the time. But in this scenario, with Phil grunting and rutting \nagainst him all it does is make Dan let out an almost embarrassingly \ngenuine noise of pleasure at the changed position.</p><p>&ldquo;Phil,&rdquo; Dan breathes, &ldquo;make me take it.&rdquo;</p><p>That&rsquo;s all it takes for Phil to really give into his own desires.</p><p>He\n rolls Dan&rsquo;s shirt up and Dan shifts underneath him to pull it off of \nhim. Phil pushes his other knee up, and effectively pushes Dan onto his \nstomach. He&rsquo;s really taking all the power in the moment. Dan keens. Phil\n can&rsquo;t help moaning as they fall into place. He pushes his chest against\n Dan&rsquo;s back and bites down on his shoulder as he fucks against him. \nHuffing breaths and pathetic whines escape his lips for every thrust.</p><p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Dan pants, voice coming muffled where his mouth is pressed against the sofa cushion. &ldquo;Good boy.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil\n feels how heavy he must be on him, how completely he&rsquo;s taking all \ncontrol. For a moment it makes him hesitate. He licks a comforting \nstripe on Dan&rsquo;s shoulder as his hips slow their previously unforgiving \npace.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it okay?&rdquo; Phil whispers almost incoherently. &ldquo;Does it feel good?&rdquo;</p><p>He\n feels Dan&rsquo;s muscles tighten where he keeps licking smoothly over his \nskin. It&rsquo;s a delicious feeling, knowing that that small action causes \nsuch a deep reaction.</p><p>&ldquo;Does it feel good?&rdquo; Dan mimics with a small laugh.</p><p>Phil\n grounds his hips back down at that, pushing all his weight on him with \nsuch force that something in the sofa creaks. Phil can&rsquo;t help but \nshudder at the sensation, how tightly his dick is trapped between Dan&rsquo;s \ncheeks and how willingly Dan gives his body up for him.</p><p>&ldquo;God yes,&rdquo; Dan moans on an inhale, &ldquo;<i>harder.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s\n all he needs to say for Phil to go into a frantic pace. He moans into \nDan&rsquo;s ear as he keeps him trapped under him, fingers digging bruises \nbetween his ribs and knees pressed hard into his waist. Dan moves just \nas frantically under him, giving exactly enough friction for Phil to \nknow he could come at any moment.</p><p>He still holds back, begging \nthis to last longer. He bites back down on Dan&rsquo;s shoulder as he feels \nhimself shudder, inching closer and closer, the approaching sensations \nalready curling his toes.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;re gonna come for me?&rdquo; Dan spits out between moans.</p><p>Phil simply whines in response, cock so perfectly snug and impossibly hard. He&rsquo;s so, so fucking close.</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh, yes, I&rsquo;m gonna come,&rdquo; Phil hears himself moan in a voice he can barely recognise himself.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmh,&rdquo; Dan moans. &ldquo;Come on me, puppy.&rdquo;</p><p>That\n word, paired with the risky feeling when the head of Phil&rsquo;s cock \nmomentarily catches at Dan&rsquo;s rim, is what causes him to shake and curse \nloudly as he blows his load on the small of Dan&rsquo;s back.</p><p>Phil moves\n with the aftermath, the few seconds of perfection that the come down \ngives, and it&rsquo;s within that time frame that he feels Dan go rock solid \nunderneath him as he tenses hard and then goes impossibly soft as he \ncomes. The choked off sounds as Dan bites his long moan into the sofa \ncushion makes Phil&rsquo;s cock twitch despite how completely spent it is.</p><p>&ldquo;Phil,&rdquo; Dan breathes out in awe. &ldquo;God, <i>Phil</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil\n unhooks his knee from trapping Dan. Dan turns around to face him, and \nfor a moment all Phil can do is look. At the reddened zig zag across his\n bare chest where the print from the cushion has pressed into it. At the\n already reddening handprints on the sides of his ribcage. Phil feels a \nstrange mix of pride and guilt looking at the result of his actions.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna bruise,&rdquo; Phil finds himself saying.</p><p>He&rsquo;s sitting up on Dan&rsquo;s thighs as he lets his fingers feel the indentations on Dan&rsquo;s chest.</p><p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Dan replies.</p><p>Phil\n looks up at his eyes and there&rsquo;s nothing but satisfaction rolling from \nDan&rsquo;s unwavering gaze. His face is still a bit red and his eyes are \nwatery. Seeing him like this in any other context would be frightening. \nDan&rsquo;s hands cover Phil&rsquo;s on his chest, tugging them up to his neck and \nmaking them wrap around loosely.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; Dan repeats himself.</p><p>Phil\n leans down. His lips meet Dan&rsquo;s half open mouth and he revels in a kiss\n that seems odd in its intimacy knowing that he&rsquo;s just willingly caused \nDan pain.</p><p>Once he pulls back, and they&rsquo;ve settled to lying side by side on the sofa, Dan traces a finger over Phil&rsquo;s cheek.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I want,&rdquo; Dan murmurs. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I need my puppy to do to me.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil\n bites down on his bottom lip and huffs a noise. There&rsquo;s a thrill in \nthose words, paired with something that, although dull, feels a bit \nsharp. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure?&rdquo; Phil asks, because he has to.</p><p>Everything\n they do together, they share. Dan&rsquo;s pleasure is Phil&rsquo;s and vice versa. \nIt almost scares him to know that this is something Dan likes, but Phil \nwouldn&rsquo;t if their positions were switched. Still, knowing Dan will \nbruise creates sparks inside. Previously it&rsquo;s all been bites and the \noccasional hickey, an unspoken thing they both allow and enjoy. Now it \nseems like more.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Dan answers, and their eyes meet.</p><p>Phil\n would guess Dan&rsquo;s are asking for more. For something deeper, something \nharder. He finds himself wanting to give him that, not just for Dan&rsquo;s \npleasure but his own.</p><p>&ldquo;Next time,&rdquo; Dan says as he shifts closer, lips almost touching, &ldquo;I want my puppy not to hold back anything.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil nods, staring at those glistening brown eyes that won&rsquo;t betray a single syllable spoken.</p><p>They seal it with a kiss, soft and slow. And yet next time they fuck, they&rsquo;ll do the exact opposite. Phil can&rsquo;t wait.</p></p>",
