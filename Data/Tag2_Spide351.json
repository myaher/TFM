But things quickly get personal.</b></p><p><a href=\"http://loveissupernatural.tumblr.com/post/146875314956/masterlist-supernatural-dean-x-reader\">Masterlist </a>/ <a href=\"http://loveissupernatural.tumblr.com/post/175595938021/the-man\">pt 1</a></p><hr><p>Your masked hero had\nonly just disappeared behind the rooftops and evening glow when multiple\nblaring police cars skidded to a stop in front of you. The officers hauled \nass out of their vehicles before their eyes settled on you, shaken\nbut safe, and the incapacitated criminal glued to the alley wall.\nWhen their eyes settled on the webbing, an obvious calling card of\nQueens\u2019 knight in shining armor, the urgency left their steps. With a\nslightly annoyed, but mostly relieved smirk, an officer pulled you\naside and wrote down your assessment of the incident while a medic\nslid a silver shock blanket around your shoulders. They referred to\nSpider-Man as a suspect as well, but you insisted that he\u2019d done\nnothing wrong, and that he was the only reason you were alive and\nbreathing. The police officer looked like he\u2019d heard this before, and\nyou\u2019re sure he had \u2013 he also looked like he\u2019d much rather be\nanywhere else, like he personally couldn\u2019t care less whether\nSpider-Man had been there or not.</p><p>Two officers\nescorted you back home, earning shocked and concerned looks from your\nparents. As soon as one of the men explained to them what happened, your\nmother hugged you to her like you were about to blow away with the\nwind, wailing. Your father almost collapsed against the kitchen\ncounter, leaning on it for support as he squeezed your shoulder. You\ntearfully welcomed your parents\u2019 affection, suddenly feeling\nextremely guilty for the way you had\u00a0been treating them.</p><p>Although you never\nwanted to experience your life flashing before your eyes again, in a\nweird way, you were thankful for the harrowing experience. Something\nabout staring at death down the barrel of a gun tends to remind one\nof the important things in life. Arguing with your parents over the\nmove suddenly seemed so stupid and trivial. You were all\ntogether, you were all happy and healthy, and that\u2019s all that really\nmattered. You would get to graduate high school, go to college, and\nlive your life all thanks to a man in red and blue spandex.</p><p>Your mother was\nheartbroken to learn that there was no way to contact Spider-Man,\ndesperately wanting to thank him for saving her only child\u2019s life.\nReporters hounded at your door for the rest of the night, begging for\nan \u201cinside scoop\u201d on the famous rumored Avenger, but you turned\nthem all away. Sharing every detail of your rescue with millions of\nviewers seemed like some kind of violation to Spider-Man\u2019s privacy,\nand part of you wanted to keep the deeply personal experience for\nyourself. Your mother shouted a final \u201cThank you, Spider-Man!\u201d at\na TV camera before you slammed your front door shut for the final\ntime that night. You hoped that whoever he was, wherever he was,\nSpider-Man would somehow see your mother\u2019s tearful thankfulness.\nAfter all, how do you accurately express to someone how you feel\nabout them saving your life? There are no words.</p><p>When your parents\nfinally released you from their grasps, and apologies peppered with\n\u201cI love you\u201ds had been exchanged at least one hundred times, you\nfinally went to bed. With a fond smile, you sat the bruised, pitiful\napple on your dresser as a momento. You knew you\u2019d have to get rid of\nit eventually. No momento, no matter how special, was worth the flies\nand worms that would invade your room.</p><p>You kept your eyes\ntrained on the faint outline of the fruit in the darkness of your\nroom and thought of Spider-Man\u2019s interestingly lensed eyes as you\ndrifted into a restless sleep. The next day was your first day at\nMidtown High School as a junior; your parents asked if you wanted to\nhold off after your life-threatening experience, but you insisted on\ncontinuing life as usual. \n</p><p>Your fitful sleep\nwas plagued with strange dreams \u2013 the barrel of a gun, a plague of\nred and blue spiders, showing up to your first day at the new school\nwith\u00a0 articles of your clothing magically disappearing.</p><p>The repetitive\nring-ching of your cellphone\u2019s alarm woke you out of an odd dream\ninvolving a flying elevator that would transport you anywhere in New\nYork. You bolted up so quickly that you were dizzy, the stickiness of\nthe dried sweat on your neck and back reminding you of your restless\nnight. You rubbed crusty sleep from your eyes as you swung your legs\nover the edge of your mattress, groaning loudly.</p><p>As you trekked to\nthe kitchen, bare feet cold against the tiled floor, you were\nsurprised to see your mother already awake, sitting at the granite\nisland wearing her glasses and sipping coffee. You muttered a\ngreeting as you walked by her toward the refrigerator, but her\noutstretched arm stopped you. Without a word, she pulled you to her\nside tightly and rubbed soft circles into your arm. You sighed\nagainst her shoulder, deflating. She kissed your head, then suddenly\nshooed you away, failing to hide the few tears that were escaping her\neyes.</p><p>After gulping down a\ncup of Yoplait, you shuffled back to your bedroom. With eyes still\nhalfway closed, you flipped on the light and pulled open your\ncurtains.</p><p>A shiny, fresh red\napple was waiting\u00a0on your windowsill.</p><p>You just stood there\nfor a moment, staring at it, your sleep-deprived brain struggling to\ncatch up to the events of the night before. As you stared at the\nthing like you couldn\u2019t believe it was there (which you couldn\u2019t),\nwhat this meant hit you like a wall. Not only had Spider-Man saved\nyour life <i>twice</i> and\nremembered what was in your grocery bag, but he had followed you home\nafter all, and he <i>was still thinking about you</i>.\nThe apple obviously hadn\u2019t been there long. If you\u2019d woken up five\nminutes earlier, would you have caught Spider-Man hanging out on your\nfire escape?</p><p>You\nopened your window and allowed yourself a short girlish giggle,\nhugging the apple to your chest. All traces of tiredness were gone in\nan instant. Did the heroic guy regularly leave gifts on the\nwindowsills of his damsels in distress? You may not be special. But\nsomething told you it wasn\u2019t a regular occurrence.</p><p>With\na goofy grin, you added Spider-Man\u2019s little gift to your lunch bag,\npleasantly surprised to find a sticky note from your dad, who\u2019d\nalready left for work. Your father hadn\u2019t left you a note like that\nin your bag lunch since you were 12 years old, but you were thankful.\nA sudden rush of\u00a0emotion washed over you. You were glad that\nyou\u2019d let your parents know how awful you felt for making the move so\ndifficult, especially your father.</p><p>Your\nmother rushed you out of the door an hour later, your primping almost\ncausing you to miss the bus. Your outfit was meticulously put\ntogether, your hair and makeup done as flawlessly as you were able to\nachieve. A positive mindset was what you focused on the most, knowing\nthat having a welcoming and friendly demeanor would improve your day\nmore than anything else. You were primed to make good first\nimpressions.</p><p>You\nhoped.</p><hr><p><br/>\nThe\nblonde girl you sat beside on the bus seemed fairly uninterested in\nyou, but wasn\u2019t mean, which you were thankful for. You sat in a\nsomewhat-comfortable silence after exchanging pleasantries. </p>\n<p>As\nsoon as you walked through the front double doors into the hallway,\nhowever, it was a different story.</p><p>You\nwere catching eyes without meaning to. Boys smiled at you,\nshamelessly stared, or an odd combination of both; you were equally\nflattered and uncomfortable. Some girls smiled, some just watched\nyou, others paid you no mind. After the stares started to bother you\na bit, you kept your head down. This was the unfortunate result of\nbeing the new girl \u2013 you\u2019d be the talk of the school for at least a\nfew days.</p><p>Per\ninstructions emailed to your mother days beforehand, you found the\nprinciple\u2019s office and retrieved your schedule and a map of the large\nhigh school. The amount of students at this school had to be, <i>at\nleast</i>, three times the amount of\nstudents in grades K-12 in your former school district. You felt\nbeyond overwhelmed. The crowds navigating the hallways were chaos,\nbut only to you. Everyone else seemed to have some kind of integral\nunderstanding of how to step around each other without causing\nspilled binders and stepped-on backpacks. Your nose was buried in\nyour map, tears starting to sting the corners of your eyes as you\nwalked down the same hallway for the third time. As you looked down\nat the paper once again, tracing your path with your finger, you ran\ninto someone\u2019s back with so much force that you almost fell backward.\nBefore the person even turned around, before you saw a face, you were\nalready apologizing over and over, your cheeks burning.</p><p>\u201cOh,\nit\u2019s okay, don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d came a forgiving voice, and you\nlooked up to see a large boy with dark hair and kind eyes. He\nextended a hand to you, obviously excited to see a new face. You\nshook it and you were surprised by his gentle grip. \u201cYou look new.\u201d</p><p>You\ngrimaced. \u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d</p><p>He\nshrugged, grinning at you. \u201cNo offense, but you kind of have that\nlook in your eyes. Ya know, the look of eternal fear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong. I have no\nidea where I\u2019m going.\u201c</p><p>\u201cHere,\nlet me see,\u201d the boy said, looking over your shoulder at your map.\nHe scoffed. \u201cOh, you don\u2019t need this. We have the same homeroom.\nJust follow me.\u201d</p><p>You\nstuttered out a thanks as a you struggled to follow him without\nbumping into one of the hundreds of other students that were\ncirculating around you. You learned that his name was Ned. He\u2019d lived\nin Queens his entire life, and according to him, once you realized\nthat New York City was just a giant grid, you\u2019d never really get\nlost. It didn\u2019t take you long to\u00a0learn that Ned was a talkative\nguy, and as long as you laughed and nodded in the right places, you\ndidn\u2019t have to carry the conversation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll\nintroduce you to some of my friends at lunch,\u201d he said, then he\nhesitated. \u201cWell, <i>friend</i>.\nPeter. And maybe Michelle\u2026 if she even talks to us today.\u201d</p><p>Your\nbrows furrowed. You laughed uneasily. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\nit\u2019s not important,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cLook, here\u2019s homeroom!\u201d</p><p>You\u2019d\nboth made numerous turns and you had no idea how you\u2019d gotten there,\nbut there was your homeroom indeed. Eyes followed you as you walked\nbehind Ned, trailing him to some empty desks in the back corner of\nthe room. A few \u201cheeeyyyy\u201ds were thrown your way by some guys on\nthe other side of the room, but Ned just looked at you pointedly and\ntold you to ignore them. You grinned uneasily but heeded his word.</p><p>After\nan awkwardly forced introduction at the front of the classroom\nencouraged by your homeroom teacher, you sat back down with burning\ncheeks. Ned continued chatting with you, your nerves slowly subsiding\nas you tried to focus on his quickly changing topics.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\nso Peter and I are meeting up after school today to work on a\nfolding/steaming machine for robotics class,\u201d he rambled. \u201cI\nmean, Peter\u2019s already done a lot of the internal programming so far,\nbut we still have a lot left to do. Oh, you\u2019ve got to meet Peter!\nHe\u2019s awesome, we\u2019ve been best friends for forever. He\u2019s wicked smart. I\ncan\u2019t give him <i>all</i> of\nthe credit, though, I\u2019m not too dumb myself.\u201d</p><p>You\ngrin at him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nworry, new girl, I\u2019ve got your back,\u201d he nodded, pursing his lips\nin a comically confident way as he patted your back. You were\nthankful. Ned knew your name, but \u201cnew girl\u201d seemed to be what he\nliked calling you. It was your first day and someone in this giant\nhigh school had taken you under their wing \u2013 you didn\u2019t care, at\nthis point he could call you whatever he damn well pleased, you were\njust glad that you weren\u2019t alone.</p><p>Ned\nwas quirky and awkward, and by the end of homeroom, you\u2019d realized\nthat he wasn\u2019t considered \u2018popular\u2019 by his classmates, particularly\nsome of the punks who had catcalled you when you\u2019d first walked in\nthe room. His cheeks flared a deep pink as some of the guys gave him\na hard time. You glared at them.</p><p>\u201cNo,\nno, don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Ned said quickly, almost begging you to\nrecede your boiling glare. \u201cI\u2019m used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re\nalways like that?\u201d you asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cPretty\nmuch,\u201d he shrugged, almost a little embarrassed. Your eyes widened.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine, really. Ya know why? Because they\u2019re peaking in\nhigh school. When we\u2019re grown ups, out in the work force, I\u2019ll be\ntheir boss.\u201d His smile had grown smug and he wiggled his brows.\n\u201c<i>I\u2019ll</i> be making all\nthe money.\u201d</p><p>You\nlaughed. Ned was an optimist and his joy radiated to you. \u201cThat\u2019s a\nreally cool way to look at the world, Ned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d\nhe smiled.</p><p>Ned\nled you to your next two classes, but he didn\u2019t share them with you.\nYou felt pitifully clingy, but you didn\u2019t care \u2013 he was the only\nlifeline in the swimming sea of unfamiliar faces and nearly-identical\nhallways and staircases. Ned practically pushed you into your rooms,\ndespite your dragging heels. You were a four year-old clinging to\nyour mother\u2019s skirt on the first day of preschool.</p><p>Without\nfail, every single teacher made you stand in front of the classroom\nto introduce yourself \u2013 some allowed you to mumble your name and\nsit, others prolonged the torture and wanted you to share \u2018fun facts\u2019\nabout yourself. Public speaking normally didn\u2019t bother you, but few\nthings were quite as humiliating as talking about yourself in front\nof strangers that really couldn\u2019t care less. Most didn\u2019t even bother\nto feign interest.</p><p>You\njumped out of your desk and ran toward the cafeteria the very moment\nthe bell released you, eager to escape curious eyes digging into the\nback of your head. The uncomfortableness of day one was now halfway\nover. You found your locker after struggling for a bit, unloading\nyour heavy books onto the small metal shelf. Your backpack was now\nwonderfully lighter, and you walked toward the lunchroom with your\nbag lunch in hand.</p><p>The\nroom was buzzing with conversation, hormones, and gossip (some of\nwhich was no doubt about you). Your eyes desperately scanned the long\nroom full of tables, searching for Ned. The last thing you wanted to\nappear to be was the lonely new girl desperate for someone to sit\nwith.</p><p>\u201cHey,\nY/N!\u201d came a friendly call, and your panicked eyes fell on Ned near\nthe back of the room, standing and waving at you. You sighed in\nrelief.</p><p>Your\neyes drifted to Ned\u2019s side as you came closer, and the first thing\nyou noticed was a handsome, friendly face and curly brown hair. You\ndid your best not to stare, but the guy was cute, and as his eyes\nshifted from Ned to you, they widened. At first you felt flattered,\nbut as you sat down at the table with a nervous grin, you realized\nthat his wide eyes seemed nervous, almost uneasy. It didn\u2019t leave a\npositive feeling in your stomach.</p><p>\u201cYou\nfound us!\u201d Ned said cheerily. He turned toward his friend, who\nlooked even more uneasy than he had on your way over. You kindly\nsmiled at the attractive boy, hoping to seem easy to talk to and\nfriendly. \u201cY/N, this is Peter Parker, the guy I was telling you\nabou\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ned\ndidn\u2019t get a chance to finish before Peter quickly muttered something\nabout having to go, avoiding your eyes and shooting out of his chair,\nhis lunch left untouched. You opened your mouth to speak, but nothing\ncame out as you watched his quickly retreating figure disappear into\nthe hallway. You\u2019d barely met the guy and he was practically running\naway from you \u2013 what could you even say to that? Was there an\nunkind rumor circulating about you? Did you have something in your\nteeth?</p><p>\u201cUhh,\num\u2026\u201d Ned stammered, his eyes darting around as if he was looking\nfor an explanation somewhere in the room, \u201cPeter \u2013 uh \u2013 he has\nthis internship. Super demanding. This internship with Tony Stark. He\njust remembered that he had to go pick something up for him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\nwhoa, whoa,\u201d you held up your hands, \u201c<i>Tony Stark</i>?\nHe works for Iron Man?! <i>The</i>\nIron Man?\u201d</p><p>Ned\nscratched the back of his neck. \u201cYeah, yeah, pretty cool, huh? He\ndoes this all the time, running off out of nowhere\u2026\u201d</p><p>You\nnarrowed your eyes, looking at the spot where Peter had disappeared\nonly moments before. \u201cAre you sure\u2026? I mean, it wasn\u2019t me \u2014 it\nwasn\u2019t something I did, was it?\u201d you asked slowly. How could it be?\nYou hadn\u2019t spoken a word to the guy. But the way he looked at you\u2026</p><p>\u201cNo,\nno, Peter\u2026 sometimes Peter, uh, gets nervous meeting new people,\nyeah,\u201d Ned explained, wringing his hands. \u201cBut he just had to go\nget something for Mr. Stark; I mean, how could it be you? That\u2019s\n<i>crazy</i>. You guys have\nnever met. Nope, never.\u201d He chuckled and immediately became very\ninterested in the food on his plate. \u201cPizza?\u201d he suddenly offered,\nsmiling a toothy grin as he held it toward you. A piece of pepperoni\nslid off and landed on the table with an awkward <i>splat</i>.</p><p>\u201cUh,\nno thanks, I\u2019m okay,\u201d you said, watching Ned suspiciously. He\nstuffed food into his mouth and stared at his plate. You unloaded\nyour brown sack, taking out your sandwich, chips, and bright red\napple. You placed it on the table with pride, separate from your\nother food, looking at it fondly and letting out a breath you didn\u2019t\nrealize you were holding. Ned eyed it.</p><p>\u201cDo\nyou, uh, like apples?\u201d he asked awkwardly, and you tried to meet\nhis eyes, but he wasn\u2019t having it.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\nI do,\u201d you said slowly. You could cut the tension with a\nbutter knife. Suddenly feeling the need to make conversation, not used\nto awkward silences around Ned, you started rambling. The last thing\nyou wanted to do was lose a potential friendship before it started\nbecause of your lack of conversational skills. \u201cI really like this\napple though because Spider-Man gave it to me.\u201d</p><p>Ned\ndropped his fork noisily. It clanged against the plate.</p><p>\u201cSpider-Man?\u201d\nhe asked, and his voice was a few octaves higher. You grinned in\ntriumph \u2013 if Spider-Man wasn\u2019t a worthy conversation topic, then\nwhat was? You felt bad for betraying the promise you made to yourself\nto keep the experience private, but it\u2019d popped out before you could\nstop it.</p><p>\u201cI\nkind of almost got\u2026 <i>mugged</i>\nlast night,\u201d you whispered, leaning in conspiratorally. Ned\u2019s\ndiscomfort radiated off of him in waves. \u201cI mean, I had a gun\npointed between my eyes and suddenly, Spider-Man was there. He saved\nmy life.\u201d You couldn\u2019t hide the dreamy look in your eyes. \u201cLong\nstory short, I kind of dropped most of my groceries\u2026 and I woke up\nthis morning with <i>this\u2014</i>\u201d\nyou lifted the apple \u201c\u2014waiting on my windowsill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\ncool,\u201d Ned said, but something was lacking in his tone. \u201cWhat a\ncrazy and unique story that I\u2019ve definitely never heard before!\u201d</p><p>You\nlaughed, now feeling as uncomfortable as Ned looked. \u201cWhat, does\nSpider-Man make a habit of leaving presents for girls he\u2019s rescued?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh,\nyeah, that\u2019s it,\u201d Ned grinned. He suddenly seemed relieved.\n\u201cSpider-Man definitely does leave presents for girls. Ya know, so\nI\u2019ve heard. Not that I\u2019d know.\u201d</p><p>Your\nheart dropped into your stomach, burning, and you were surprised that\nNed couldn\u2019t hear it.</p><p>\u201cOh,\nreally?\u201d you asked, trying to seem disinterested. \u201cThat\u2019s cool of\nhim. I guess. What guy in his right mind wouldn\u2019t take advantage of\nall of the thankful women, right?\u201d You tried to laugh.</p><p>\u201cHa\nha, right,\u201d Ned said, almost to himself, \u201che\u2019d be <i>insane\n</i>not to. He\u2019s\u2026 i<i>nsane</i>.\u201d\nIf you didn\u2019t know better, you\u2019d say that disbelief and\ndisappointment laced his tone.</p><p>The\nrest of lunch was just quiet chewing and occasional blurbs of\nconversation. You didn\u2019t see Ned again for the remainder of the day.\nYou couldn\u2019t help but feel that it had something to do with Peter\u2019s\nsudden departure. Maybe, for whatever reason, Ned\u2019s best friend\ndidn\u2019t like you, and that made Ned decide that you weren\u2019t\nfriend-material? But why wouldn\u2019t Peter like you? You\u2019d done nothing\nto him. Maybe he had a girlfriend and he thought you were staring too\nmuch? No, that wouldn\u2019t make sense.</p><p>Discouraged\nand lonely, you boarded the bus and sat alone near the back. You\nplayed on your phone, avoiding eyes and conversation, counting down\nthe stops until the yellow vehicle neared your apartment building.\nYou hopped off the bus, running toward the towering building as if it\nwere a protective parent waiting to envelope you with a hug.</p><p>Peter\nParker was on your mind as you unenthusiastically ate dinner, chewing\nthe same bite of food for at least five minutes straight. You\nskillfully avoided your parents\u2019 prying questions about your first\nday, giving vague answers. After a while they stopped trying.</p><p>You\ncouldn\u2019t stop replaying the interaction with Peter in your head in\nslo-mo, over and over again. You reanalyzed every tiny look, word,\nstep. Maybe Ned was right, maybe he just had to run off for his\ninternship with Mr. Stark \u2013 but then why was Ned suddenly so\nawkward and almost cold with you? Was Peter\u2019s sudden departure his\nseal of disapproval of you? But you didn\u2019t do anything wrong! Your\nhead was going back and forth, back and forth. If someone didn\u2019t like\nyou, then you wanted to know why, and they better have a damn good\nreason because you were freaking delightful.</p><p>In \nthat moment, you\u2019d decided. Tomorrow, you were talking to Peter\nParker, whether he liked it or not.</p><p><b><a href=\"http://loveissupernatural.tumblr.com/post/175990319926/the-man\">\nPt 3</a></b></p>",

But things quickly get personal.</b></p><p><a href=\"http://loveissupernatural.tumblr.com/post/146875314956/masterlist-supernatural-dean-x-reader\">Masterlist </a>/ <a href=\"http://loveissupernatural.tumblr.com/post/175595938021/the-man\">pt 1</a></p><hr><p>Your masked hero had\nonly just disappeared behind the rooftops and evening glow when multiple\nblaring police cars skidded to a stop in front of you. The officers hauled \nass out of their vehicles before their eyes settled on you, shaken\nbut safe, and the incapacitated criminal glued to the alley wall.\nWhen their eyes settled on the webbing, an obvious calling card of\nQueens\u2019 knight in shining armor, the urgency left their steps. With a\nslightly annoyed, but mostly relieved smirk, an officer pulled you\naside and wrote down your assessment of the incident while a medic\nslid a silver shock blanket around your shoulders. They referred to\nSpider-Man as a suspect as well, but you insisted that he\u2019d done\nnothing wrong, and that he was the only reason you were alive and\nbreathing. The police officer looked like he\u2019d heard this before, and\nyou\u2019re sure he had \u2013 he also looked like he\u2019d much rather be\nanywhere else, like he personally couldn\u2019t care less whether\nSpider-Man had been there or not.</p><p>Two officers\nescorted you back home, earning shocked and concerned looks from your\nparents. As soon as one of the men explained to them what happened, your\nmother hugged you to her like you were about to blow away with the\nwind, wailing. Your father almost collapsed against the kitchen\ncounter, leaning on it for support as he squeezed your shoulder. You\ntearfully welcomed your parents\u2019 affection, suddenly feeling\nextremely guilty for the way you had\u00a0been treating them.</p><p>Although you never\nwanted to experience your life flashing before your eyes again, in a\nweird way, you were thankful for the harrowing experience. Something\nabout staring at death down the barrel of a gun tends to remind one\nof the important things in life. Arguing with your parents over the\nmove suddenly seemed so stupid and trivial. You were all\ntogether, you were all happy and healthy, and that\u2019s all that really\nmattered. You would get to graduate high school, go to college, and\nlive your life all thanks to a man in red and blue spandex.</p><p>Your mother was\nheartbroken to learn that there was no way to contact Spider-Man,\ndesperately wanting to thank him for saving her only child\u2019s life.\nReporters hounded at your door for the rest of the night, begging for\nan \u201cinside scoop\u201d on the famous rumored Avenger, but you turned\nthem all away. Sharing every detail of your rescue with millions of\nviewers seemed like some kind of violation to Spider-Man\u2019s privacy,\nand part of you wanted to keep the deeply personal experience for\nyourself. Your mother shouted a final \u201cThank you, Spider-Man!\u201d at\na TV camera before you slammed your front door shut for the final\ntime that night. You hoped that whoever he was, wherever he was,\nSpider-Man would somehow see your mother\u2019s tearful thankfulness.\nAfter all, how do you accurately express to someone how you feel\nabout them saving your life? There are no words.</p><p>When your parents\nfinally released you from their grasps, and apologies peppered with\n\u201cI love you\u201ds had been exchanged at least one hundred times, you\nfinally went to bed. With a fond smile, you sat the bruised, pitiful\napple on your dresser as a momento. You knew you\u2019d have to get rid of\nit eventually. No momento, no matter how special, was worth the flies\nand worms that would invade your room.</p><p>You kept your eyes\ntrained on the faint outline of the fruit in the darkness of your\nroom and thought of Spider-Man\u2019s interestingly lensed eyes as you\ndrifted into a restless sleep. The next day was your first day at\nMidtown High School as a junior; your parents asked if you wanted to\nhold off after your life-threatening experience, but you insisted on\ncontinuing life as usual. \n</p><p>Your fitful sleep\nwas plagued with strange dreams \u2013 the barrel of a gun, a plague of\nred and blue spiders, showing up to your first day at the new school\nwith\u00a0 articles of your clothing magically disappearing.</p><p>The repetitive\nring-ching of your cellphone\u2019s alarm woke you out of an odd dream\ninvolving a flying elevator that would transport you anywhere in New\nYork. You bolted up so quickly that you were dizzy, the stickiness of\nthe dried sweat on your neck and back reminding you of your restless\nnight. You rubbed crusty sleep from your eyes as you swung your legs\nover the edge of your mattress, groaning loudly.</p><p>As you trekked to\nthe kitchen, bare feet cold against the tiled floor, you were\nsurprised to see your mother already awake, sitting at the granite\nisland wearing her glasses and sipping coffee. You muttered a\ngreeting as you walked by her toward the refrigerator, but her\noutstretched arm stopped you. Without a word, she pulled you to her\nside tightly and rubbed soft circles into your arm. You sighed\nagainst her shoulder, deflating. She kissed your head, then suddenly\nshooed you away, failing to hide the few tears that were escaping her\neyes.</p><p>After gulping down a\ncup of Yoplait, you shuffled back to your bedroom. With eyes still\nhalfway closed, you flipped on the light and pulled open your\ncurtains.</p><p>A shiny, fresh red\napple was waiting\u00a0on your windowsill.</p><p>You just stood there\nfor a moment, staring at it, your sleep-deprived brain struggling to\ncatch up to the events of the night before. As you stared at the\nthing like you couldn\u2019t believe it was there (which you couldn\u2019t),\nwhat this meant hit you like a wall. Not only had Spider-Man saved\nyour life <i>twice</i> and\nremembered what was in your grocery bag, but he had followed you home\nafter all, and he <i>was still thinking about you</i>.\nThe apple obviously hadn\u2019t been there long. If you\u2019d woken up five\nminutes earlier, would you have caught Spider-Man hanging out on your\nfire escape?</p><p>You\nopened your window and allowed yourself a short girlish giggle,\nhugging the apple to your chest. All traces of tiredness were gone in\nan instant. Did the heroic guy regularly leave gifts on the\nwindowsills of his damsels in distress? You may not be special. But\nsomething told you it wasn\u2019t a regular occurrence.</p><p>With\na goofy grin, you added Spider-Man\u2019s little gift to your lunch bag,\npleasantly surprised to find a sticky note from your dad, who\u2019d\nalready left for work. Your father hadn\u2019t left you a note like that\nin your bag lunch since you were 12 years old, but you were thankful.\nA sudden rush of\u00a0emotion washed over you. You were glad that\nyou\u2019d let your parents know how awful you felt for making the move so\ndifficult, especially your father.</p><p>Your\nmother rushed you out of the door an hour later, your primping almost\ncausing you to miss the bus. Your outfit was meticulously put\ntogether, your hair and makeup done as flawlessly as you were able to\nachieve. A positive mindset was what you focused on the most, knowing\nthat having a welcoming and friendly demeanor would improve your day\nmore than anything else. You were primed to make good first\nimpressions.</p><p>You\nhoped.</p><hr><p><br>\nThe\nblonde girl you sat beside on the bus seemed fairly uninterested in\nyou, but wasn\u2019t mean, which you were thankful for. You sat in a\nsomewhat-comfortable silence after exchanging pleasantries. </p>\n<p>As\nsoon as you walked through the front double doors into the hallway,\nhowever, it was a different story.</p><p>You\nwere catching eyes without meaning to. Boys smiled at you,\nshamelessly stared, or an odd combination of both; you were equally\nflattered and uncomfortable. Some girls smiled, some just watched\nyou, others paid you no mind. After the stares started to bother you\na bit, you kept your head down. This was the unfortunate result of\nbeing the new girl \u2013 you\u2019d be the talk of the school for at least a\nfew days.</p><p>Per\ninstructions emailed to your mother days beforehand, you found the\nprinciple\u2019s office and retrieved your schedule and a map of the large\nhigh school. The amount of students at this school had to be, <i>at\nleast</i>, three times the amount of\nstudents in grades K-12 in your former school district. You felt\nbeyond overwhelmed. The crowds navigating the hallways were chaos,\nbut only to you. Everyone else seemed to have some kind of integral\nunderstanding of how to step around each other without causing\nspilled binders and stepped-on backpacks. Your nose was buried in\nyour map, tears starting to sting the corners of your eyes as you\nwalked down the same hallway for the third time. As you looked down\nat the paper once again, tracing your path with your finger, you ran\ninto someone\u2019s back with so much force that you almost fell backward.\nBefore the person even turned around, before you saw a face, you were\nalready apologizing over and over, your cheeks burning.</p><p>\u201cOh,\nit\u2019s okay, don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d came a forgiving voice, and you\nlooked up to see a large boy with dark hair and kind eyes. He\nextended a hand to you, obviously excited to see a new face. You\nshook it and you were surprised by his gentle grip. \u201cYou look new.\u201d</p><p>You\ngrimaced. \u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d</p><p>He\nshrugged, grinning at you. \u201cNo offense, but you kind of have that\nlook in your eyes. Ya know, the look of eternal fear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong. I have no\nidea where I\u2019m going.\u201c</p><p>\u201cHere,\nlet me see,\u201d the boy said, looking over your shoulder at your map.\nHe scoffed. \u201cOh, you don\u2019t need this. We have the same homeroom.\nJust follow me.\u201d</p><p>You\nstuttered out a thanks as a you struggled to follow him without\nbumping into one of the hundreds of other students that were\ncirculating around you. You learned that his name was Ned. He\u2019d lived\nin Queens his entire life, and according to him, once you realized\nthat New York City was just a giant grid, you\u2019d never really get\nlost. It didn\u2019t take you long to\u00a0learn that Ned was a talkative\nguy, and as long as you laughed and nodded in the right places, you\ndidn\u2019t have to carry the conversation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll\nintroduce you to some of my friends at lunch,\u201d he said, then he\nhesitated. \u201cWell, <i>friend</i>.\nPeter. And maybe Michelle\u2026 if she even talks to us today.\u201d</p><p>Your\nbrows furrowed. You laughed uneasily. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\nit\u2019s not important,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cLook, here\u2019s homeroom!\u201d</p><p>You\u2019d\nboth made numerous turns and you had no idea how you\u2019d gotten there,\nbut there was your homeroom indeed. Eyes followed you as you walked\nbehind Ned, trailing him to some empty desks in the back corner of\nthe room. A few \u201cheeeyyyy\u201ds were thrown your way by some guys on\nthe other side of the room, but Ned just looked at you pointedly and\ntold you to ignore them. You grinned uneasily but heeded his word.</p><p>After\nan awkwardly forced introduction at the front of the classroom\nencouraged by your homeroom teacher, you sat back down with burning\ncheeks. Ned continued chatting with you, your nerves slowly subsiding\nas you tried to focus on his quickly changing topics.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\nso Peter and I are meeting up after school today to work on a\nfolding/steaming machine for robotics class,\u201d he rambled. \u201cI\nmean, Peter\u2019s already done a lot of the internal programming so far,\nbut we still have a lot left to do. Oh, you\u2019ve got to meet Peter!\nHe\u2019s awesome, we\u2019ve been best friends for forever. He\u2019s wicked smart. I\ncan\u2019t give him <i>all</i> of\nthe credit, though, I\u2019m not too dumb myself.\u201d</p><p>You\ngrin at him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nworry, new girl, I\u2019ve got your back,\u201d he nodded, pursing his lips\nin a comically confident way as he patted your back. You were\nthankful. Ned knew your name, but \u201cnew girl\u201d seemed to be what he\nliked calling you. It was your first day and someone in this giant\nhigh school had taken you under their wing \u2013 you didn\u2019t care, at\nthis point he could call you whatever he damn well pleased, you were\njust glad that you weren\u2019t alone.</p><p>Ned\nwas quirky and awkward, and by the end of homeroom, you\u2019d realized\nthat he wasn\u2019t considered \u2018popular\u2019 by his classmates, particularly\nsome of the punks who had catcalled you when you\u2019d first walked in\nthe room. His cheeks flared a deep pink as some of the guys gave him\na hard time. You glared at them.</p><p>\u201cNo,\nno, don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Ned said quickly, almost begging you to\nrecede your boiling glare. \u201cI\u2019m used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re\nalways like that?\u201d you asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cPretty\nmuch,\u201d he shrugged, almost a little embarrassed. Your eyes widened.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine, really. Ya know why? Because they\u2019re peaking in\nhigh school. When we\u2019re grown ups, out in the work force, I\u2019ll be\ntheir boss.\u201d His smile had grown smug and he wiggled his brows.\n\u201c<i>I\u2019ll</i> be making all\nthe money.\u201d</p><p>You\nlaughed. Ned was an optimist and his joy radiated to you. \u201cThat\u2019s a\nreally cool way to look at the world, Ned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d\nhe smiled.</p><p>Ned\nled you to your next two classes, but he didn\u2019t share them with you.\nYou felt pitifully clingy, but you didn\u2019t care \u2013 he was the only\nlifeline in the swimming sea of unfamiliar faces and nearly-identical\nhallways and staircases. Ned practically pushed you into your rooms,\ndespite your dragging heels. You were a four year-old clinging to\nyour mother\u2019s skirt on the first day of preschool.</p><p>Without\nfail, every single teacher made you stand in front of the classroom\nto introduce yourself \u2013 some allowed you to mumble your name and\nsit, others prolonged the torture and wanted you to share \u2018fun facts\u2019\nabout yourself. Public speaking normally didn\u2019t bother you, but few\nthings were quite as humiliating as talking about yourself in front\nof strangers that really couldn\u2019t care less. Most didn\u2019t even bother\nto feign interest.</p><p>You\njumped out of your desk and ran toward the cafeteria the very moment\nthe bell released you, eager to escape curious eyes digging into the\nback of your head. The uncomfortableness of day one was now halfway\nover. You found your locker after struggling for a bit, unloading\nyour heavy books onto the small metal shelf. Your backpack was now\nwonderfully lighter, and you walked toward the lunchroom with your\nbag lunch in hand.</p><p>The\nroom was buzzing with conversation, hormones, and gossip (some of\nwhich was no doubt about you). Your eyes desperately scanned the long\nroom full of tables, searching for Ned. The last thing you wanted to\nappear to be was the lonely new girl desperate for someone to sit\nwith.</p><p>\u201cHey,\nY/N!\u201d came a friendly call, and your panicked eyes fell on Ned near\nthe back of the room, standing and waving at you. You sighed in\nrelief.</p><p>Your\neyes drifted to Ned\u2019s side as you came closer, and the first thing\nyou noticed was a handsome, friendly face and curly brown hair. You\ndid your best not to stare, but the guy was cute, and as his eyes\nshifted from Ned to you, they widened. At first you felt flattered,\nbut as you sat down at the table with a nervous grin, you realized\nthat his wide eyes seemed nervous, almost uneasy. It didn\u2019t leave a\npositive feeling in your stomach.</p><p>\u201cYou\nfound us!\u201d Ned said cheerily. He turned toward his friend, who\nlooked even more uneasy than he had on your way over. You kindly\nsmiled at the attractive boy, hoping to seem easy to talk to and\nfriendly. \u201cY/N, this is Peter Parker, the guy I was telling you\nabou\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ned\ndidn\u2019t get a chance to finish before Peter quickly muttered something\nabout having to go, avoiding your eyes and shooting out of his chair,\nhis lunch left untouched. You opened your mouth to speak, but nothing\ncame out as you watched his quickly retreating figure disappear into\nthe hallway. You\u2019d barely met the guy and he was practically running\naway from you \u2013 what could you even say to that? Was there an\nunkind rumor circulating about you? Did you have something in your\nteeth?</p><p>\u201cUhh,\num\u2026\u201d Ned stammered, his eyes darting around as if he was looking\nfor an explanation somewhere in the room, \u201cPeter \u2013 uh \u2013 he has\nthis internship. Super demanding. This internship with Tony Stark. He\njust remembered that he had to go pick something up for him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\nwhoa, whoa,\u201d you held up your hands, \u201c<i>Tony Stark</i>?\nHe works for Iron Man?! <i>The</i>\nIron Man?\u201d</p><p>Ned\nscratched the back of his neck. \u201cYeah, yeah, pretty cool, huh? He\ndoes this all the time, running off out of nowhere\u2026\u201d</p><p>You\nnarrowed your eyes, looking at the spot where Peter had disappeared\nonly moments before. \u201cAre you sure\u2026? I mean, it wasn\u2019t me \u2014 it\nwasn\u2019t something I did, was it?\u201d you asked slowly. How could it be?\nYou hadn\u2019t spoken a word to the guy. But the way he looked at you\u2026</p><p>\u201cNo,\nno, Peter\u2026 sometimes Peter, uh, gets nervous meeting new people,\nyeah,\u201d Ned explained, wringing his hands. \u201cBut he just had to go\nget something for Mr. Stark; I mean, how could it be you? That\u2019s\n<i>crazy</i>. You guys have\nnever met. Nope, never.\u201d He chuckled and immediately became very\ninterested in the food on his plate. \u201cPizza?\u201d he suddenly offered,\nsmiling a toothy grin as he held it toward you. A piece of pepperoni\nslid off and landed on the table with an awkward <i>splat</i>.</p><p>\u201cUh,\nno thanks, I\u2019m okay,\u201d you said, watching Ned suspiciously. He\nstuffed food into his mouth and stared at his plate. You unloaded\nyour brown sack, taking out your sandwich, chips, and bright red\napple. You placed it on the table with pride, separate from your\nother food, looking at it fondly and letting out a breath you didn\u2019t\nrealize you were holding. Ned eyed it.</p><p>\u201cDo\nyou, uh, like apples?\u201d he asked awkwardly, and you tried to meet\nhis eyes, but he wasn\u2019t having it.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\nI do,\u201d you said slowly. You could cut the tension with a\nbutter knife. Suddenly feeling the need to make conversation, not used\nto awkward silences around Ned, you started rambling. The last thing\nyou wanted to do was lose a potential friendship before it started\nbecause of your lack of conversational skills. \u201cI really like this\napple though because Spider-Man gave it to me.\u201d</p><p>Ned\ndropped his fork noisily. It clanged against the plate.</p><p>\u201cSpider-Man?\u201d\nhe asked, and his voice was a few octaves higher. You grinned in\ntriumph \u2013 if Spider-Man wasn\u2019t a worthy conversation topic, then\nwhat was? You felt bad for betraying the promise you made to yourself\nto keep the experience private, but it\u2019d popped out before you could\nstop it.</p><p>\u201cI\nkind of almost got\u2026 <i>mugged</i>\nlast night,\u201d you whispered, leaning in conspiratorally. Ned\u2019s\ndiscomfort radiated off of him in waves. \u201cI mean, I had a gun\npointed between my eyes and suddenly, Spider-Man was there. He saved\nmy life.\u201d You couldn\u2019t hide the dreamy look in your eyes. \u201cLong\nstory short, I kind of dropped most of my groceries\u2026 and I woke up\nthis morning with <i>this\u2014</i>\u201d\nyou lifted the apple \u201c\u2014waiting on my windowsill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\ncool,\u201d Ned said, but something was lacking in his tone. \u201cWhat a\ncrazy and unique story that I\u2019ve definitely never heard before!\u201d</p><p>You\nlaughed, now feeling as uncomfortable as Ned looked. \u201cWhat, does\nSpider-Man make a habit of leaving presents for girls he\u2019s rescued?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh,\nyeah, that\u2019s it,\u201d Ned grinned. He suddenly seemed relieved.\n\u201cSpider-Man definitely does leave presents for girls. Ya know, so\nI\u2019ve heard. Not that I\u2019d know.\u201d</p><p>Your\nheart dropped into your stomach, burning, and you were surprised that\nNed couldn\u2019t hear it.</p><p>\u201cOh,\nreally?\u201d you asked, trying to seem disinterested. \u201cThat\u2019s cool of\nhim. I guess. What guy in his right mind wouldn\u2019t take advantage of\nall of the thankful women, right?\u201d You tried to laugh.</p><p>\u201cHa\nha, right,\u201d Ned said, almost to himself, \u201che\u2019d be <i>insane\n</i>not to. He\u2019s\u2026 i<i>nsane</i>.\u201d\nIf you didn\u2019t know better, you\u2019d say that disbelief and\ndisappointment laced his tone.</p><p>The\nrest of lunch was just quiet chewing and occasional blurbs of\nconversation. You didn\u2019t see Ned again for the remainder of the day.\nYou couldn\u2019t help but feel that it had something to do with Peter\u2019s\nsudden departure. Maybe, for whatever reason, Ned\u2019s best friend\ndidn\u2019t like you, and that made Ned decide that you weren\u2019t\nfriend-material? But why wouldn\u2019t Peter like you? You\u2019d done nothing\nto him. Maybe he had a girlfriend and he thought you were staring too\nmuch? No, that wouldn\u2019t make sense.</p><p>Discouraged\nand lonely, you boarded the bus and sat alone near the back. You\nplayed on your phone, avoiding eyes and conversation, counting down\nthe stops until the yellow vehicle neared your apartment building.\nYou hopped off the bus, running toward the towering building as if it\nwere a protective parent waiting to envelope you with a hug.</p><p>Peter\nParker was on your mind as you unenthusiastically ate dinner, chewing\nthe same bite of food for at least five minutes straight. You\nskillfully avoided your parents\u2019 prying questions about your first\nday, giving vague answers. After a while they stopped trying.</p><p>You\ncouldn\u2019t stop replaying the interaction with Peter in your head in\nslo-mo, over and over again. You reanalyzed every tiny look, word,\nstep. Maybe Ned was right, maybe he just had to run off for his\ninternship with Mr. Stark \u2013 but then why was Ned suddenly so\nawkward and almost cold with you? Was Peter\u2019s sudden departure his\nseal of disapproval of you? But you didn\u2019t do anything wrong! Your\nhead was going back and forth, back and forth. If someone didn\u2019t like\nyou, then you wanted to know why, and they better have a damn good\nreason because you were freaking delightful.</p><p>In \nthat moment, you\u2019d decided. Tomorrow, you were talking to Peter\nParker, whether he liked it or not.</p><p><b><a href=\"http://loveissupernatural.tumblr.com/post/175990319926/the-man\">\nPt 3</a></b></p>",

But things quickly get personal.</b></p><p><a href=\"http://loveissupernatural.tumblr.com/post/146875314956/masterlist-supernatural-dean-x-reader\">Masterlist </a>/ <a href=\"http://loveissupernatural.tumblr.com/post/175595938021/the-man\">pt 1</a></p><hr><p>Your masked hero had\nonly just disappeared behind the rooftops and evening glow when multiple\nblaring police cars skidded to a stop in front of you. The officers hauled \nass out of their vehicles before their eyes settled on you, shaken\nbut safe, and the incapacitated criminal glued to the alley wall.\nWhen their eyes settled on the webbing, an obvious calling card of\nQueens\u2019 knight in shining armor, the urgency left their steps. With a\nslightly annoyed, but mostly relieved smirk, an officer pulled you\naside and wrote down your assessment of the incident while a medic\nslid a silver shock blanket around your shoulders. They referred to\nSpider-Man as a suspect as well, but you insisted that he\u2019d done\nnothing wrong, and that he was the only reason you were alive and\nbreathing. The police officer looked like he\u2019d heard this before, and\nyou\u2019re sure he had \u2013 he also looked like he\u2019d much rather be\nanywhere else, like he personally couldn\u2019t care less whether\nSpider-Man had been there or not.</p><p>Two officers\nescorted you back home, earning shocked and concerned looks from your\nparents. As soon as one of the men explained to them what happened, your\nmother hugged you to her like you were about to blow away with the\nwind, wailing. Your father almost collapsed against the kitchen\ncounter, leaning on it for support as he squeezed your shoulder. You\ntearfully welcomed your parents\u2019 affection, suddenly feeling\nextremely guilty for the way you had\u00a0been treating them.</p><p>Although you never\nwanted to experience your life flashing before your eyes again, in a\nweird way, you were thankful for the harrowing experience. Something\nabout staring at death down the barrel of a gun tends to remind one\nof the important things in life. Arguing with your parents over the\nmove suddenly seemed so stupid and trivial. You were all\ntogether, you were all happy and healthy, and that\u2019s all that really\nmattered. You would get to graduate high school, go to college, and\nlive your life all thanks to a man in red and blue spandex.</p><p>Your mother was\nheartbroken to learn that there was no way to contact Spider-Man,\ndesperately wanting to thank him for saving her only child\u2019s life.\nReporters hounded at your door for the rest of the night, begging for\nan \u201cinside scoop\u201d on the famous rumored Avenger, but you turned\nthem all away. Sharing every detail of your rescue with millions of\nviewers seemed like some kind of violation to Spider-Man\u2019s privacy,\nand part of you wanted to keep the deeply personal experience for\nyourself. Your mother shouted a final \u201cThank you, Spider-Man!\u201d at\na TV camera before you slammed your front door shut for the final\ntime that night. You hoped that whoever he was, wherever he was,\nSpider-Man would somehow see your mother\u2019s tearful thankfulness.\nAfter all, how do you accurately express to someone how you feel\nabout them saving your life? There are no words.</p><p>When your parents\nfinally released you from their grasps, and apologies peppered with\n\u201cI love you\u201ds had been exchanged at least one hundred times, you\nfinally went to bed. With a fond smile, you sat the bruised, pitiful\napple on your dresser as a momento. You knew you\u2019d have to get rid of\nit eventually. No momento, no matter how special, was worth the flies\nand worms that would invade your room.</p><p>You kept your eyes\ntrained on the faint outline of the fruit in the darkness of your\nroom and thought of Spider-Man\u2019s interestingly lensed eyes as you\ndrifted into a restless sleep. The next day was your first day at\nMidtown High School as a junior; your parents asked if you wanted to\nhold off after your life-threatening experience, but you insisted on\ncontinuing life as usual. \n</p><p>Your fitful sleep\nwas plagued with strange dreams \u2013 the barrel of a gun, a plague of\nred and blue spiders, showing up to your first day at the new school\nwith\u00a0 articles of your clothing magically disappearing.</p><p>The repetitive\nring-ching of your cellphone\u2019s alarm woke you out of an odd dream\ninvolving a flying elevator that would transport you anywhere in New\nYork. You bolted up so quickly that you were dizzy, the stickiness of\nthe dried sweat on your neck and back reminding you of your restless\nnight. You rubbed crusty sleep from your eyes as you swung your legs\nover the edge of your mattress, groaning loudly.</p><p>As you trekked to\nthe kitchen, bare feet cold against the tiled floor, you were\nsurprised to see your mother already awake, sitting at the granite\nisland wearing her glasses and sipping coffee. You muttered a\ngreeting as you walked by her toward the refrigerator, but her\noutstretched arm stopped you. Without a word, she pulled you to her\nside tightly and rubbed soft circles into your arm. You sighed\nagainst her shoulder, deflating. She kissed your head, then suddenly\nshooed you away, failing to hide the few tears that were escaping her\neyes.</p><p>After gulping down a\ncup of Yoplait, you shuffled back to your bedroom. With eyes still\nhalfway closed, you flipped on the light and pulled open your\ncurtains.</p><p>A shiny, fresh red\napple was waiting\u00a0on your windowsill.</p><p>You just stood there\nfor a moment, staring at it, your sleep-deprived brain struggling to\ncatch up to the events of the night before. As you stared at the\nthing like you couldn\u2019t believe it was there (which you couldn\u2019t),\nwhat this meant hit you like a wall. Not only had Spider-Man saved\nyour life <i>twice</i> and\nremembered what was in your grocery bag, but he had followed you home\nafter all, and he <i>was still thinking about you</i>.\nThe apple obviously hadn\u2019t been there long. If you\u2019d woken up five\nminutes earlier, would you have caught Spider-Man hanging out on your\nfire escape?</p><p>You\nopened your window and allowed yourself a short girlish giggle,\nhugging the apple to your chest. All traces of tiredness were gone in\nan instant. Did the heroic guy regularly leave gifts on the\nwindowsills of his damsels in distress? You may not be special. But\nsomething told you it wasn\u2019t a regular occurrence.</p><p>With\na goofy grin, you added Spider-Man\u2019s little gift to your lunch bag,\npleasantly surprised to find a sticky note from your dad, who\u2019d\nalready left for work. Your father hadn\u2019t left you a note like that\nin your bag lunch since you were 12 years old, but you were thankful.\nA sudden rush of\u00a0emotion washed over you. You were glad that\nyou\u2019d let your parents know how awful you felt for making the move so\ndifficult, especially your father.</p><p>Your\nmother rushed you out of the door an hour later, your primping almost\ncausing you to miss the bus. Your outfit was meticulously put\ntogether, your hair and makeup done as flawlessly as you were able to\nachieve. A positive mindset was what you focused on the most, knowing\nthat having a welcoming and friendly demeanor would improve your day\nmore than anything else. You were primed to make good first\nimpressions.</p><p>You\nhoped.</p><hr><p><br>\nThe\nblonde girl you sat beside on the bus seemed fairly uninterested in\nyou, but wasn\u2019t mean, which you were thankful for. You sat in a\nsomewhat-comfortable silence after exchanging pleasantries. </p>\n<p>As\nsoon as you walked through the front double doors into the hallway,\nhowever, it was a different story.</p><p>You\nwere catching eyes without meaning to. Boys smiled at you,\nshamelessly stared, or an odd combination of both; you were equally\nflattered and uncomfortable. Some girls smiled, some just watched\nyou, others paid you no mind. After the stares started to bother you\na bit, you kept your head down. This was the unfortunate result of\nbeing the new girl \u2013 you\u2019d be the talk of the school for at least a\nfew days.</p><p>Per\ninstructions emailed to your mother days beforehand, you found the\nprinciple\u2019s office and retrieved your schedule and a map of the large\nhigh school. The amount of students at this school had to be, <i>at\nleast</i>, three times the amount of\nstudents in grades K-12 in your former school district. You felt\nbeyond overwhelmed. The crowds navigating the hallways were chaos,\nbut only to you. Everyone else seemed to have some kind of integral\nunderstanding of how to step around each other without causing\nspilled binders and stepped-on backpacks. Your nose was buried in\nyour map, tears starting to sting the corners of your eyes as you\nwalked down the same hallway for the third time. As you looked down\nat the paper once again, tracing your path with your finger, you ran\ninto someone\u2019s back with so much force that you almost fell backward.\nBefore the person even turned around, before you saw a face, you were\nalready apologizing over and over, your cheeks burning.</p><p>\u201cOh,\nit\u2019s okay, don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d came a forgiving voice, and you\nlooked up to see a large boy with dark hair and kind eyes. He\nextended a hand to you, obviously excited to see a new face. You\nshook it and you were surprised by his gentle grip. \u201cYou look new.\u201d</p><p>You\ngrimaced. \u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d</p><p>He\nshrugged, grinning at you. \u201cNo offense, but you kind of have that\nlook in your eyes. Ya know, the look of eternal fear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong. I have no\nidea where I\u2019m going.\u201c</p><p>\u201cHere,\nlet me see,\u201d the boy said, looking over your shoulder at your map.\nHe scoffed. \u201cOh, you don\u2019t need this. We have the same homeroom.\nJust follow me.\u201d</p><p>You\nstuttered out a thanks as a you struggled to follow him without\nbumping into one of the hundreds of other students that were\ncirculating around you. You learned that his name was Ned. He\u2019d lived\nin Queens his entire life, and according to him, once you realized\nthat New York City was just a giant grid, you\u2019d never really get\nlost. It didn\u2019t take you long to\u00a0learn that Ned was a talkative\nguy, and as long as you laughed and nodded in the right places, you\ndidn\u2019t have to carry the conversation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll\nintroduce you to some of my friends at lunch,\u201d he said, then he\nhesitated. \u201cWell, <i>friend</i>.\nPeter. And maybe Michelle\u2026 if she even talks to us today.\u201d</p><p>Your\nbrows furrowed. You laughed uneasily. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\nit\u2019s not important,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cLook, here\u2019s homeroom!\u201d</p><p>You\u2019d\nboth made numerous turns and you had no idea how you\u2019d gotten there,\nbut there was your homeroom indeed. Eyes followed you as you walked\nbehind Ned, trailing him to some empty desks in the back corner of\nthe room. A few \u201cheeeyyyy\u201ds were thrown your way by some guys on\nthe other side of the room, but Ned just looked at you pointedly and\ntold you to ignore them. You grinned uneasily but heeded his word.</p><p>After\nan awkwardly forced introduction at the front of the classroom\nencouraged by your homeroom teacher, you sat back down with burning\ncheeks. Ned continued chatting with you, your nerves slowly subsiding\nas you tried to focus on his quickly changing topics.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\nso Peter and I are meeting up after school today to work on a\nfolding/steaming machine for robotics class,\u201d he rambled. \u201cI\nmean, Peter\u2019s already done a lot of the internal programming so far,\nbut we still have a lot left to do. Oh, you\u2019ve got to meet Peter!\nHe\u2019s awesome, we\u2019ve been best friends for forever. He\u2019s wicked smart. I\ncan\u2019t give him <i>all</i> of\nthe credit, though, I\u2019m not too dumb myself.\u201d</p><p>You\ngrin at him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nworry, new girl, I\u2019ve got your back,\u201d he nodded, pursing his lips\nin a comically confident way as he patted your back. You were\nthankful. Ned knew your name, but \u201cnew girl\u201d seemed to be what he\nliked calling you. It was your first day and someone in this giant\nhigh school had taken you under their wing \u2013 you didn\u2019t care, at\nthis point he could call you whatever he damn well pleased, you were\njust glad that you weren\u2019t alone.</p><p>Ned\nwas quirky and awkward, and by the end of homeroom, you\u2019d realized\nthat he wasn\u2019t considered \u2018popular\u2019 by his classmates, particularly\nsome of the punks who had catcalled you when you\u2019d first walked in\nthe room. His cheeks flared a deep pink as some of the guys gave him\na hard time. You glared at them.</p><p>\u201cNo,\nno, don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Ned said quickly, almost begging you to\nrecede your boiling glare. \u201cI\u2019m used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re\nalways like that?\u201d you asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cPretty\nmuch,\u201d he shrugged, almost a little embarrassed. Your eyes widened.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine, really. Ya know why? Because they\u2019re peaking in\nhigh school. When we\u2019re grown ups, out in the work force, I\u2019ll be\ntheir boss.\u201d His smile had grown smug and he wiggled his brows.\n\u201c<i>I\u2019ll</i> be making all\nthe money.\u201d</p><p>You\nlaughed. Ned was an optimist and his joy radiated to you. \u201cThat\u2019s a\nreally cool way to look at the world, Ned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d\nhe smiled.</p><p>Ned\nled you to your next two classes, but he didn\u2019t share them with you.\nYou felt pitifully clingy, but you didn\u2019t care \u2013 he was the only\nlifeline in the swimming sea of unfamiliar faces and nearly-identical\nhallways and staircases. Ned practically pushed you into your rooms,\ndespite your dragging heels. You were a four year-old clinging to\nyour mother\u2019s skirt on the first day of preschool.</p><p>Without\nfail, every single teacher made you stand in front of the classroom\nto introduce yourself \u2013 some allowed you to mumble your name and\nsit, others prolonged the torture and wanted you to share \u2018fun facts\u2019\nabout yourself. Public speaking normally didn\u2019t bother you, but few\nthings were quite as humiliating as talking about yourself in front\nof strangers that really couldn\u2019t care less. Most didn\u2019t even bother\nto feign interest.</p><p>You\njumped out of your desk and ran toward the cafeteria the very moment\nthe bell released you, eager to escape curious eyes digging into the\nback of your head. The uncomfortableness of day one was now halfway\nover. You found your locker after struggling for a bit, unloading\nyour heavy books onto the small metal shelf. Your backpack was now\nwonderfully lighter, and you walked toward the lunchroom with your\nbag lunch in hand.</p><p>The\nroom was buzzing with conversation, hormones, and gossip (some of\nwhich was no doubt about you). Your eyes desperately scanned the long\nroom full of tables, searching for Ned. The last thing you wanted to\nappear to be was the lonely new girl desperate for someone to sit\nwith.</p><p>\u201cHey,\nY/N!\u201d came a friendly call, and your panicked eyes fell on Ned near\nthe back of the room, standing and waving at you. You sighed in\nrelief.</p><p>Your\neyes drifted to Ned\u2019s side as you came closer, and the first thing\nyou noticed was a handsome, friendly face and curly brown hair. You\ndid your best not to stare, but the guy was cute, and as his eyes\nshifted from Ned to you, they widened. At first you felt flattered,\nbut as you sat down at the table with a nervous grin, you realized\nthat his wide eyes seemed nervous, almost uneasy. It didn\u2019t leave a\npositive feeling in your stomach.</p><p>\u201cYou\nfound us!\u201d Ned said cheerily. He turned toward his friend, who\nlooked even more uneasy than he had on your way over. You kindly\nsmiled at the attractive boy, hoping to seem easy to talk to and\nfriendly. \u201cY/N, this is Peter Parker, the guy I was telling you\nabou\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ned\ndidn\u2019t get a chance to finish before Peter quickly muttered something\nabout having to go, avoiding your eyes and shooting out of his chair,\nhis lunch left untouched. You opened your mouth to speak, but nothing\ncame out as you watched his quickly retreating figure disappear into\nthe hallway. You\u2019d barely met the guy and he was practically running\naway from you \u2013 what could you even say to that? Was there an\nunkind rumor circulating about you? Did you have something in your\nteeth?</p><p>\u201cUhh,\num\u2026\u201d Ned stammered, his eyes darting around as if he was looking\nfor an explanation somewhere in the room, \u201cPeter \u2013 uh \u2013 he has\nthis internship. Super demanding. This internship with Tony Stark. He\njust remembered that he had to go pick something up for him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\nwhoa, whoa,\u201d you held up your hands, \u201c<i>Tony Stark</i>?\nHe works for Iron Man?! <i>The</i>\nIron Man?\u201d</p><p>Ned\nscratched the back of his neck. \u201cYeah, yeah, pretty cool, huh? He\ndoes this all the time, running off out of nowhere\u2026\u201d</p><p>You\nnarrowed your eyes, looking at the spot where Peter had disappeared\nonly moments before. \u201cAre you sure\u2026? I mean, it wasn\u2019t me \u2014 it\nwasn\u2019t something I did, was it?\u201d you asked slowly. How could it be?\nYou hadn\u2019t spoken a word to the guy. But the way he looked at you\u2026</p><p>\u201cNo,\nno, Peter\u2026 sometimes Peter, uh, gets nervous meeting new people,\nyeah,\u201d Ned explained, wringing his hands. \u201cBut he just had to go\nget something for Mr. Stark; I mean, how could it be you? That\u2019s\n<i>crazy</i>. You guys have\nnever met. Nope, never.\u201d He chuckled and immediately became very\ninterested in the food on his plate. \u201cPizza?\u201d he suddenly offered,\nsmiling a toothy grin as he held it toward you. A piece of pepperoni\nslid off and landed on the table with an awkward <i>splat</i>.</p><p>\u201cUh,\nno thanks, I\u2019m okay,\u201d you said, watching Ned suspiciously. He\nstuffed food into his mouth and stared at his plate. You unloaded\nyour brown sack, taking out your sandwich, chips, and bright red\napple. You placed it on the table with pride, separate from your\nother food, looking at it fondly and letting out a breath you didn\u2019t\nrealize you were holding. Ned eyed it.</p><p>\u201cDo\nyou, uh, like apples?\u201d he asked awkwardly, and you tried to meet\nhis eyes, but he wasn\u2019t having it.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\nI do,\u201d you said slowly. You could cut the tension with a\nbutter knife. Suddenly feeling the need to make conversation, not used\nto awkward silences around Ned, you started rambling. The last thing\nyou wanted to do was lose a potential friendship before it started\nbecause of your lack of conversational skills. \u201cI really like this\napple though because Spider-Man gave it to me.\u201d</p><p>Ned\ndropped his fork noisily. It clanged against the plate.</p><p>\u201cSpider-Man?\u201d\nhe asked, and his voice was a few octaves higher. You grinned in\ntriumph \u2013 if Spider-Man wasn\u2019t a worthy conversation topic, then\nwhat was? You felt bad for betraying the promise you made to yourself\nto keep the experience private, but it\u2019d popped out before you could\nstop it.</p><p>\u201cI\nkind of almost got\u2026 <i>mugged</i>\nlast night,\u201d you whispered, leaning in conspiratorally. Ned\u2019s\ndiscomfort radiated off of him in waves. \u201cI mean, I had a gun\npointed between my eyes and suddenly, Spider-Man was there. He saved\nmy life.\u201d You couldn\u2019t hide the dreamy look in your eyes. \u201cLong\nstory short, I kind of dropped most of my groceries\u2026 and I woke up\nthis morning with <i>this\u2014</i>\u201d\nyou lifted the apple \u201c\u2014waiting on my windowsill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\ncool,\u201d Ned said, but something was lacking in his tone. \u201cWhat a\ncrazy and unique story that I\u2019ve definitely never heard before!\u201d</p><p>You\nlaughed, now feeling as uncomfortable as Ned looked. \u201cWhat, does\nSpider-Man make a habit of leaving presents for girls he\u2019s rescued?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh,\nyeah, that\u2019s it,\u201d Ned grinned. He suddenly seemed relieved.\n\u201cSpider-Man definitely does leave presents for girls. Ya know, so\nI\u2019ve heard. Not that I\u2019d know.\u201d</p><p>Your\nheart dropped into your stomach, burning, and you were surprised that\nNed couldn\u2019t hear it.</p><p>\u201cOh,\nreally?\u201d you asked, trying to seem disinterested. \u201cThat\u2019s cool of\nhim. I guess. What guy in his right mind wouldn\u2019t take advantage of\nall of the thankful women, right?\u201d You tried to laugh.</p><p>\u201cHa\nha, right,\u201d Ned said, almost to himself, \u201che\u2019d be <i>insane\n</i>not to. He\u2019s\u2026 i<i>nsane</i>.\u201d\nIf you didn\u2019t know better, you\u2019d say that disbelief and\ndisappointment laced his tone.</p><p>The\nrest of lunch was just quiet chewing and occasional blurbs of\nconversation. You didn\u2019t see Ned again for the remainder of the day.\nYou couldn\u2019t help but feel that it had something to do with Peter\u2019s\nsudden departure. Maybe, for whatever reason, Ned\u2019s best friend\ndidn\u2019t like you, and that made Ned decide that you weren\u2019t\nfriend-material? But why wouldn\u2019t Peter like you? You\u2019d done nothing\nto him. Maybe he had a girlfriend and he thought you were staring too\nmuch? No, that wouldn\u2019t make sense.</p><p>Discouraged\nand lonely, you boarded the bus and sat alone near the back. You\nplayed on your phone, avoiding eyes and conversation, counting down\nthe stops until the yellow vehicle neared your apartment building.\nYou hopped off the bus, running toward the towering building as if it\nwere a protective parent waiting to envelope you with a hug.</p><p>Peter\nParker was on your mind as you unenthusiastically ate dinner, chewing\nthe same bite of food for at least five minutes straight. You\nskillfully avoided your parents\u2019 prying questions about your first\nday, giving vague answers. After a while they stopped trying.</p><p>You\ncouldn\u2019t stop replaying the interaction with Peter in your head in\nslo-mo, over and over again. You reanalyzed every tiny look, word,\nstep. Maybe Ned was right, maybe he just had to run off for his\ninternship with Mr. Stark \u2013 but then why was Ned suddenly so\nawkward and almost cold with you? Was Peter\u2019s sudden departure his\nseal of disapproval of you? But you didn\u2019t do anything wrong! Your\nhead was going back and forth, back and forth. If someone didn\u2019t like\nyou, then you wanted to know why, and they better have a damn good\nreason because you were freaking delightful.</p><p>In \nthat moment, you\u2019d decided. Tomorrow, you were talking to Peter\nParker, whether he liked it or not.</p><p><b><a href=\"http://loveissupernatural.tumblr.com/post/175990319926/the-man\">\nPt 3</a></b></p>",

The officers hauled \nass out of their vehicles before their eyes settled on you, shaken\nbut safe, and the incapacitated criminal glued to the alley wall.\nWhen their eyes settled on the webbing, an obvious calling card of\nQueens&rsquo; knight in shining armor, the urgency left their steps. With a\nslightly annoyed, but mostly relieved smirk, an officer pulled you\naside and wrote down your assessment of the incident while a medic\nslid a silver shock blanket around your shoulders. They referred to\nSpider-Man as a suspect as well, but you insisted that he&rsquo;d done\nnothing wrong, and that he was the only reason you were alive and\nbreathing. The police officer looked like he&rsquo;d heard this before, and\nyou&rsquo;re sure he had &ndash; he also looked like he&rsquo;d much rather be\nanywhere else, like he personally couldn&rsquo;t care less whether\nSpider-Man had been there or not.</p><p>Two officers\nescorted you back home, earning shocked and concerned looks from your\nparents. As soon as one of the men explained to them what happened, your\nmother hugged you to her like you were about to blow away with the\nwind, wailing. Your father almost collapsed against the kitchen\ncounter, leaning on it for support as he squeezed your shoulder. You\ntearfully welcomed your parents&rsquo; affection, suddenly feeling\nextremely guilty for the way you had&nbsp;been treating them.</p><p>Although you never\nwanted to experience your life flashing before your eyes again, in a\nweird way, you were thankful for the harrowing experience. Something\nabout staring at death down the barrel of a gun tends to remind one\nof the important things in life. Arguing with your parents over the\nmove suddenly seemed so stupid and trivial. You were all\ntogether, you were all happy and healthy, and that&rsquo;s all that really\nmattered. You would get to graduate high school, go to college, and\nlive your life all thanks to a man in red and blue spandex.</p><p>Your mother was\nheartbroken to learn that there was no way to contact Spider-Man,\ndesperately wanting to thank him for saving her only child&rsquo;s life.\nReporters hounded at your door for the rest of the night, begging for\nan &ldquo;inside scoop&rdquo; on the famous rumored Avenger, but you turned\nthem all away. Sharing every detail of your rescue with millions of\nviewers seemed like some kind of violation to Spider-Man&rsquo;s privacy,\nand part of you wanted to keep the deeply personal experience for\nyourself. Your mother shouted a final &ldquo;Thank you, Spider-Man!&rdquo; at\na TV camera before you slammed your front door shut for the final\ntime that night. You hoped that whoever he was, wherever he was,\nSpider-Man would somehow see your mother&rsquo;s tearful thankfulness.\nAfter all, how do you accurately express to someone how you feel\nabout them saving your life? There are no words.</p><p>When your parents\nfinally released you from their grasps, and apologies peppered with\n&ldquo;I love you&rdquo;s had been exchanged at least one hundred times, you\nfinally went to bed. With a fond smile, you sat the bruised, pitiful\napple on your dresser as a momento. You knew you&rsquo;d have to get rid of\nit eventually. No momento, no matter how special, was worth the flies\nand worms that would invade your room.</p><p>You kept your eyes\ntrained on the faint outline of the fruit in the darkness of your\nroom and thought of Spider-Man&rsquo;s interestingly lensed eyes as you\ndrifted into a restless sleep. The next day was your first day at\nMidtown High School as a junior; your parents asked if you wanted to\nhold off after your life-threatening experience, but you insisted on\ncontinuing life as usual. \n</p><p>Your fitful sleep\nwas plagued with strange dreams &ndash; the barrel of a gun, a plague of\nred and blue spiders, showing up to your first day at the new school\nwith&nbsp; articles of your clothing magically disappearing.</p><p>The repetitive\nring-ching of your cellphone&rsquo;s alarm woke you out of an odd dream\ninvolving a flying elevator that would transport you anywhere in New\nYork. You bolted up so quickly that you were dizzy, the stickiness of\nthe dried sweat on your neck and back reminding you of your restless\nnight. You rubbed crusty sleep from your eyes as you swung your legs\nover the edge of your mattress, groaning loudly.</p><p>As you trekked to\nthe kitchen, bare feet cold against the tiled floor, you were\nsurprised to see your mother already awake, sitting at the granite\nisland wearing her glasses and sipping coffee. You muttered a\ngreeting as you walked by her toward the refrigerator, but her\noutstretched arm stopped you. Without a word, she pulled you to her\nside tightly and rubbed soft circles into your arm. You sighed\nagainst her shoulder, deflating. She kissed your head, then suddenly\nshooed you away, failing to hide the few tears that were escaping her\neyes.</p><p>After gulping down a\ncup of Yoplait, you shuffled back to your bedroom. With eyes still\nhalfway closed, you flipped on the light and pulled open your\ncurtains.</p><p>A shiny, fresh red\napple was waiting&nbsp;on your windowsill.</p><p>You just stood there\nfor a moment, staring at it, your sleep-deprived brain struggling to\ncatch up to the events of the night before. As you stared at the\nthing like you couldn&rsquo;t believe it was there (which you couldn&rsquo;t),\nwhat this meant hit you like a wall. Not only had Spider-Man saved\nyour life <i>twice</i> and\nremembered what was in your grocery bag, but he had followed you home\nafter all, and he <i>was still thinking about you</i>.\nThe apple obviously hadn&rsquo;t been there long. If you&rsquo;d woken up five\nminutes earlier, would you have caught Spider-Man hanging out on your\nfire escape?</p><p>You\nopened your window and allowed yourself a short girlish giggle,\nhugging the apple to your chest. All traces of tiredness were gone in\nan instant. Did the heroic guy regularly leave gifts on the\nwindowsills of his damsels in distress? You may not be special. But\nsomething told you it wasn&rsquo;t a regular occurrence.</p><p>With\na goofy grin, you added Spider-Man&rsquo;s little gift to your lunch bag,\npleasantly surprised to find a sticky note from your dad, who&rsquo;d\nalready left for work. Your father hadn&rsquo;t left you a note like that\nin your bag lunch since you were 12 years old, but you were thankful.\nA sudden rush of&nbsp;emotion washed over you. You were glad that\nyou&rsquo;d let your parents know how awful you felt for making the move so\ndifficult, especially your father.</p><p>Your\nmother rushed you out of the door an hour later, your primping almost\ncausing you to miss the bus. Your outfit was meticulously put\ntogether, your hair and makeup done as flawlessly as you were able to\nachieve. A positive mindset was what you focused on the most, knowing\nthat having a welcoming and friendly demeanor would improve your day\nmore than anything else. You were primed to make good first\nimpressions.</p><p>You\nhoped.</p><hr /><p><br />\nThe\nblonde girl you sat beside on the bus seemed fairly uninterested in\nyou, but wasn&rsquo;t mean, which you were thankful for. You sat in a\nsomewhat-comfortable silence after exchanging pleasantries. </p>\n<p>As\nsoon as you walked through the front double doors into the hallway,\nhowever, it was a different story.</p><p>You\nwere catching eyes without meaning to. Boys smiled at you,\nshamelessly stared, or an odd combination of both; you were equally\nflattered and uncomfortable. Some girls smiled, some just watched\nyou, others paid you no mind. After the stares started to bother you\na bit, you kept your head down. This was the unfortunate result of\nbeing the new girl &ndash; you&rsquo;d be the talk of the school for at least a\nfew days.</p><p>Per\ninstructions emailed to your mother days beforehand, you found the\nprinciple&rsquo;s office and retrieved your schedule and a map of the large\nhigh school. The amount of students at this school had to be, <i>at\nleast</i>, three times the amount of\nstudents in grades K-12 in your former school district. You felt\nbeyond overwhelmed. The crowds navigating the hallways were chaos,\nbut only to you. Everyone else seemed to have some kind of integral\nunderstanding of how to step around each other without causing\nspilled binders and stepped-on backpacks. Your nose was buried in\nyour map, tears starting to sting the corners of your eyes as you\nwalked down the same hallway for the third time. As you looked down\nat the paper once again, tracing your path with your finger, you ran\ninto someone&rsquo;s back with so much force that you almost fell backward.\nBefore the person even turned around, before you saw a face, you were\nalready apologizing over and over, your cheeks burning.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,\nit&rsquo;s okay, don&rsquo;t worry about it,&rdquo; came a forgiving voice, and you\nlooked up to see a large boy with dark hair and kind eyes. He\nextended a hand to you, obviously excited to see a new face. You\nshook it and you were surprised by his gentle grip. &ldquo;You look new.&rdquo;</p><p>You\ngrimaced. &ldquo;Is it that obvious?&rdquo;</p><p>He\nshrugged, grinning at you. &ldquo;No offense, but you kind of have that\nlook in your eyes. Ya know, the look of eternal fear?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not wrong. I have no\nidea where I&rsquo;m going.&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Here,\nlet me see,&rdquo; the boy said, looking over your shoulder at your map.\nHe scoffed. &ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t need this. We have the same homeroom.\nJust follow me.&rdquo;</p><p>You\nstuttered out a thanks as a you struggled to follow him without\nbumping into one of the hundreds of other students that were\ncirculating around you. You learned that his name was Ned. He&rsquo;d lived\nin Queens his entire life, and according to him, once you realized\nthat New York City was just a giant grid, you&rsquo;d never really get\nlost. It didn&rsquo;t take you long to&nbsp;learn that Ned was a talkative\nguy, and as long as you laughed and nodded in the right places, you\ndidn&rsquo;t have to carry the conversation.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll\nintroduce you to some of my friends at lunch,&rdquo; he said, then he\nhesitated. &ldquo;Well, <i>friend</i>.\nPeter. And maybe Michelle&hellip; if she even talks to us today.&rdquo;</p><p>Your\nbrows furrowed. You laughed uneasily. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,\nit&rsquo;s not important,&rdquo; he said quickly. &ldquo;Look, here&rsquo;s homeroom!&rdquo;</p><p>You&rsquo;d\nboth made numerous turns and you had no idea how you&rsquo;d gotten there,\nbut there was your homeroom indeed. Eyes followed you as you walked\nbehind Ned, trailing him to some empty desks in the back corner of\nthe room. A few &ldquo;heeeyyyy&rdquo;s were thrown your way by some guys on\nthe other side of the room, but Ned just looked at you pointedly and\ntold you to ignore them. You grinned uneasily but heeded his word.</p><p>After\nan awkwardly forced introduction at the front of the classroom\nencouraged by your homeroom teacher, you sat back down with burning\ncheeks. Ned continued chatting with you, your nerves slowly subsiding\nas you tried to focus on his quickly changing topics.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,\nso Peter and I are meeting up after school today to work on a\nfolding/steaming machine for robotics class,&rdquo; he rambled. &ldquo;I\nmean, Peter&rsquo;s already done a lot of the internal programming so far,\nbut we still have a lot left to do. Oh, you&rsquo;ve got to meet Peter!\nHe&rsquo;s awesome, we&rsquo;ve been best friends for forever. He&rsquo;s wicked smart. I\ncan&rsquo;t give him <i>all</i> of\nthe credit, though, I&rsquo;m not too dumb myself.&rdquo;</p><p>You\ngrin at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t\nworry, new girl, I&rsquo;ve got your back,&rdquo; he nodded, pursing his lips\nin a comically confident way as he patted your back. You were\nthankful. Ned knew your name, but &ldquo;new girl&rdquo; seemed to be what he\nliked calling you. It was your first day and someone in this giant\nhigh school had taken you under their wing &ndash; you didn&rsquo;t care, at\nthis point he could call you whatever he damn well pleased, you were\njust glad that you weren&rsquo;t alone.</p><p>Ned\nwas quirky and awkward, and by the end of homeroom, you&rsquo;d realized\nthat he wasn&rsquo;t considered &lsquo;popular&rsquo; by his classmates, particularly\nsome of the punks who had catcalled you when you&rsquo;d first walked in\nthe room. His cheeks flared a deep pink as some of the guys gave him\na hard time. You glared at them.</p><p>&ldquo;No,\nno, don&rsquo;t worry about it,&rdquo; Ned said quickly, almost begging you to\nrecede your boiling glare. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m used to it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re\nalways like that?&rdquo; you asked incredulously.</p><p>&ldquo;Pretty\nmuch,&rdquo; he shrugged, almost a little embarrassed. Your eyes widened.\n&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s fine, really. Ya know why? Because they&rsquo;re peaking in\nhigh school. When we&rsquo;re grown ups, out in the work force, I&rsquo;ll be\ntheir boss.&rdquo; His smile had grown smug and he wiggled his brows.\n&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll</i> be making all\nthe money.&rdquo;</p><p>You\nlaughed. Ned was an optimist and his joy radiated to you. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a\nreally cool way to look at the world, Ned.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo;\nhe smiled.</p><p>Ned\nled you to your next two classes, but he didn&rsquo;t share them with you.\nYou felt pitifully clingy, but you didn&rsquo;t care &ndash; he was the only\nlifeline in the swimming sea of unfamiliar faces and nearly-identical\nhallways and staircases. Ned practically pushed you into your rooms,\ndespite your dragging heels. You were a four year-old clinging to\nyour mother&rsquo;s skirt on the first day of preschool.</p><p>Without\nfail, every single teacher made you stand in front of the classroom\nto introduce yourself &ndash; some allowed you to mumble your name and\nsit, others prolonged the torture and wanted you to share &lsquo;fun facts&rsquo;\nabout yourself. Public speaking normally didn&rsquo;t bother you, but few\nthings were quite as humiliating as talking about yourself in front\nof strangers that really couldn&rsquo;t care less. Most didn&rsquo;t even bother\nto feign interest.</p><p>You\njumped out of your desk and ran toward the cafeteria the very moment\nthe bell released you, eager to escape curious eyes digging into the\nback of your head. The uncomfortableness of day one was now halfway\nover. You found your locker after struggling for a bit, unloading\nyour heavy books onto the small metal shelf. Your backpack was now\nwonderfully lighter, and you walked toward the lunchroom with your\nbag lunch in hand.</p><p>The\nroom was buzzing with conversation, hormones, and gossip (some of\nwhich was no doubt about you). Your eyes desperately scanned the long\nroom full of tables, searching for Ned. The last thing you wanted to\nappear to be was the lonely new girl desperate for someone to sit\nwith.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,\nY/N!&rdquo; came a friendly call, and your panicked eyes fell on Ned near\nthe back of the room, standing and waving at you. You sighed in\nrelief.</p><p>Your\neyes drifted to Ned&rsquo;s side as you came closer, and the first thing\nyou noticed was a handsome, friendly face and curly brown hair. You\ndid your best not to stare, but the guy was cute, and as his eyes\nshifted from Ned to you, they widened. At first you felt flattered,\nbut as you sat down at the table with a nervous grin, you realized\nthat his wide eyes seemed nervous, almost uneasy. It didn&rsquo;t leave a\npositive feeling in your stomach.</p><p>&ldquo;You\nfound us!&rdquo; Ned said cheerily. He turned toward his friend, who\nlooked even more uneasy than he had on your way over. You kindly\nsmiled at the attractive boy, hoping to seem easy to talk to and\nfriendly. &ldquo;Y/N, this is Peter Parker, the guy I was telling you\nabou&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Ned\ndidn&rsquo;t get a chance to finish before Peter quickly muttered something\nabout having to go, avoiding your eyes and shooting out of his chair,\nhis lunch left untouched. You opened your mouth to speak, but nothing\ncame out as you watched his quickly retreating figure disappear into\nthe hallway. You&rsquo;d barely met the guy and he was practically running\naway from you &ndash; what could you even say to that? Was there an\nunkind rumor circulating about you? Did you have something in your\nteeth?</p><p>&ldquo;Uhh,\num&hellip;&rdquo; Ned stammered, his eyes darting around as if he was looking\nfor an explanation somewhere in the room, &ldquo;Peter &ndash; uh &ndash; he has\nthis internship. Super demanding. This internship with Tony Stark. He\njust remembered that he had to go pick something up for him&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whoa,\nwhoa, whoa,&rdquo; you held up your hands, &ldquo;<i>Tony Stark</i>?\nHe works for Iron Man?! <i>The</i>\nIron Man?&rdquo;</p><p>Ned\nscratched the back of his neck. &ldquo;Yeah, yeah, pretty cool, huh? He\ndoes this all the time, running off out of nowhere&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>You\nnarrowed your eyes, looking at the spot where Peter had disappeared\nonly moments before. &ldquo;Are you sure&hellip;? I mean, it wasn&rsquo;t me &mdash; it\nwasn&rsquo;t something I did, was it?&rdquo; you asked slowly. How could it be?\nYou hadn&rsquo;t spoken a word to the guy. But the way he looked at you&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;No,\nno, Peter&hellip; sometimes Peter, uh, gets nervous meeting new people,\nyeah,&rdquo; Ned explained, wringing his hands. &ldquo;But he just had to go\nget something for Mr. Stark; I mean, how could it be you? That&rsquo;s\n<i>crazy</i>. You guys have\nnever met. Nope, never.&rdquo; He chuckled and immediately became very\ninterested in the food on his plate. &ldquo;Pizza?&rdquo; he suddenly offered,\nsmiling a toothy grin as he held it toward you. A piece of pepperoni\nslid off and landed on the table with an awkward <i>splat</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh,\nno thanks, I&rsquo;m okay,&rdquo; you said, watching Ned suspiciously. He\nstuffed food into his mouth and stared at his plate. You unloaded\nyour brown sack, taking out your sandwich, chips, and bright red\napple. You placed it on the table with pride, separate from your\nother food, looking at it fondly and letting out a breath you didn&rsquo;t\nrealize you were holding. Ned eyed it.</p><p>&ldquo;Do\nyou, uh, like apples?&rdquo; he asked awkwardly, and you tried to meet\nhis eyes, but he wasn&rsquo;t having it.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,\nI do,&rdquo; you said slowly. You could cut the tension with a\nbutter knife. Suddenly feeling the need to make conversation, not used\nto awkward silences around Ned, you started rambling. The last thing\nyou wanted to do was lose a potential friendship before it started\nbecause of your lack of conversational skills. &ldquo;I really like this\napple though because Spider-Man gave it to me.&rdquo;</p><p>Ned\ndropped his fork noisily. It clanged against the plate.</p><p>&ldquo;Spider-Man?&rdquo;\nhe asked, and his voice was a few octaves higher. You grinned in\ntriumph &ndash; if Spider-Man wasn&rsquo;t a worthy conversation topic, then\nwhat was? You felt bad for betraying the promise you made to yourself\nto keep the experience private, but it&rsquo;d popped out before you could\nstop it.</p><p>&ldquo;I\nkind of almost got&hellip; <i>mugged</i>\nlast night,&rdquo; you whispered, leaning in conspiratorally. Ned&rsquo;s\ndiscomfort radiated off of him in waves. &ldquo;I mean, I had a gun\npointed between my eyes and suddenly, Spider-Man was there. He saved\nmy life.&rdquo; You couldn&rsquo;t hide the dreamy look in your eyes. &ldquo;Long\nstory short, I kind of dropped most of my groceries&hellip; and I woke up\nthis morning with <i>this&mdash;</i>&rdquo;\nyou lifted the apple &ldquo;&mdash;waiting on my windowsill.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wow,\ncool,&rdquo; Ned said, but something was lacking in his tone. &ldquo;What a\ncrazy and unique story that I&rsquo;ve definitely never heard before!&rdquo;</p><p>You\nlaughed, now feeling as uncomfortable as Ned looked. &ldquo;What, does\nSpider-Man make a habit of leaving presents for girls he&rsquo;s rescued?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh,\nyeah, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; Ned grinned. He suddenly seemed relieved.\n&ldquo;Spider-Man definitely does leave presents for girls. Ya know, so\nI&rsquo;ve heard. Not that I&rsquo;d know.&rdquo;</p><p>Your\nheart dropped into your stomach, burning, and you were surprised that\nNed couldn&rsquo;t hear it.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,\nreally?&rdquo; you asked, trying to seem disinterested. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s cool of\nhim. I guess. What guy in his right mind wouldn&rsquo;t take advantage of\nall of the thankful women, right?&rdquo; You tried to laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Ha\nha, right,&rdquo; Ned said, almost to himself, &ldquo;he&rsquo;d be <i>insane\n</i>not to. He&rsquo;s&hellip; i<i>nsane</i>.&rdquo;\nIf you didn&rsquo;t know better, you&rsquo;d say that disbelief and\ndisappointment laced his tone.</p><p>The\nrest of lunch was just quiet chewing and occasional blurbs of\nconversation. You didn&rsquo;t see Ned again for the remainder of the day.\nYou couldn&rsquo;t help but feel that it had something to do with Peter&rsquo;s\nsudden departure. Maybe, for whatever reason, Ned&rsquo;s best friend\ndidn&rsquo;t like you, and that made Ned decide that you weren&rsquo;t\nfriend-material? But why wouldn&rsquo;t Peter like you? You&rsquo;d done nothing\nto him. Maybe he had a girlfriend and he thought you were staring too\nmuch? No, that wouldn&rsquo;t make sense.</p><p>Discouraged\nand lonely, you boarded the bus and sat alone near the back. You\nplayed on your phone, avoiding eyes and conversation, counting down\nthe stops until the yellow vehicle neared your apartment building.\nYou hopped off the bus, running toward the towering building as if it\nwere a protective parent waiting to envelope you with a hug.</p><p>Peter\nParker was on your mind as you unenthusiastically ate dinner, chewing\nthe same bite of food for at least five minutes straight. You\nskillfully avoided your parents&rsquo; prying questions about your first\nday, giving vague answers. After a while they stopped trying.</p><p>You\ncouldn&rsquo;t stop replaying the interaction with Peter in your head in\nslo-mo, over and over again. You reanalyzed every tiny look, word,\nstep. Maybe Ned was right, maybe he just had to run off for his\ninternship with Mr. Stark &ndash; but then why was Ned suddenly so\nawkward and almost cold with you? Was Peter&rsquo;s sudden departure his\nseal of disapproval of you? But you didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong! Your\nhead was going back and forth, back and forth. If someone didn&rsquo;t like\nyou, then you wanted to know why, and they better have a damn good\nreason because you were freaking delightful.</p><p>In \nthat moment, you&rsquo;d decided. Tomorrow, you were talking to Peter\nParker, whether he liked it or not.</p><p><b><a href=\"http://loveissupernatural.tumblr.com/post/175990319926/the-man\">\nPt 3</a></b></p>",

There was no overlooking the solemn sound of silence coming from the girls now forever closed door. There was no denying that something was just off during meals without her there. There was no pretending that every single person on the team missed the (H/C) girl with the bright (E/C) eyes that never failed to bring them smiles. Despite being the youngest agent at only 19 years old, she was the fiercest and most loyal person they had ever come across. They all missed her dearly but none more so than Peter. In the weeks following her disappearance and eventual funeral featuring an empty casket, Peter had barely slept. He barley ate.

Before the question could even be asked of what was going on, a small cough sounded behind him and all eyes turned on the dirty, but healthy, figure behind him. She stood awkwardly before giving a sheepish smile.</p><p>\u201cSurprise! I\u2019m back from the dead. Isn\u2019t that exciting?\u201d</p><p>There was silence and then cheers. The Avengers all rushed over and gave her hugs and asked questions on where she had been and why she\u2019d never came back.</p><p>She explained she was almost captured by HYDRA and had to lay low in a rural town before finally being able to return home. As her story came to an end, Peter rounded the corner into the room, wondering about all the noise. He froze in his tracks for only a second and then he was running and wrapping his arms around the girl so tightly he knew she was probably having trouble breathing. She didn\u2019t tell him to stop though. Instead, she wrapped her own arms around him tightly and buried her face in his chest, tears streaming down her face.</p><p>The other Avengers shared a look and quietly slipped out of the room. After a moment of silence, (Y/N) looked up at Peter and tried to speak, but he stopped her by placing a kiss on her lips so full of love and longing and sadness and fear that it took her breath away. As it ended and he rested his forehead against hers, Peter smiled.</p><p>\u201cI know you have one hell of a story to tell,\u201d he starts, voice soft, \u201cbut at the moment all I care about is that you\u2019re alive so please don\u2019t talk just yet.
