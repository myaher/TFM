When he\u2019d first discovered that TJ and Amber were siblings, he\u2019d been afraid that the dynamics in their relationships would change, but so far, everything seemed to be going okay. Except for the fact that he was now not only harbouring a crush on his best friend\u2019s past nemesis, but also on his new friend\u2019s brother. He was breaking two classic rules right there, and he wasn\u2019t sure how to deal with that.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you looking for?\u201d Amber asked, her perfectly intimidating eyebrows drawn together. She was frowning in amusement as Cyrus strained his neck around every corner, mindlessly searching for TJ, but there was a glimmer of suspicion in her eyes as well. Did she know what was going on?</p><p>Cyrus slapped on a smile and returned his attention to Amber. Technically, he was here to see her anyway, so it would be rude of him to obsess over TJ all night.</p><p>\u201cI was just wondering where the bathroom is?\u201d he lied.</p><p>Amber pursed her lips. For a moment, Cyrus was convinced she was going to confront him about TJ, but then a porcelain smile slipped into place.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one just around the corner,\u201d she said, \u201cand another one opposite TJ\u2019s room upstairs.\u201d</p><p>At the mere mention of TJ\u2019s name, Cyrus\u2019 heart started to beat faster. His crush on the older boy was quickly snowballing into dangerous territory; if he didn\u2019t put a stop to it soon, he was at the risk of falling too far. The only thing that kept him from trying to move on was the small chance that TJ might feel the same way. It was a long shot, but Cyrus had definitely been receiving some not-so-subtle signals from TJ lately, and he was determined to figure out what that meant before he completely dismissed the possibility of his crush being reciprocated.</p><p>\u201cOkay, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need to go now, or&hellip;?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Amber shot him another suspicious look, then shrugged, tossing her blonde waves over her shoulder as she directed him to the living room. \u201cYou can just dump your stuff on the couch.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled at the collection of basketball trophies adorning the cabinet in the corner of the room, each of them proudly displaying TJ\u2019s name. From the looks of it, they dated back almost nine years. It was adorable to think that TJ had been obsessed with basketball since he was a little kid, and Cyrus couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at the idea of his friend winning games and making his family proud from a young age. He\u2019d always known that TJ was more than just a dumb jock; he had a passion for basketball,\u00a0<i>not</i>\u00a0the bad-boy reputation that came with it.</p><p>\u201cThose are all TJ\u2019s,\u201d Amber said, waving her hand at the cabinet. \u201cI guess my little brother stole all the talent in the family.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus rolled his eyes fondly. \u201cYou\u2019re talented too, Amber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt what? Scaring people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s just one of\u00a0<i>many</i>\u00a0talents you possess.\u201d</p><p>Amber smirked. \u201cYou know, for a gay guy, you really know how to sweet talk a lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Cyrus said with a laugh. Usually, if someone joked about his sexuality, he got anxious and paranoid. But with Amber, it was different. Ever since she\u2019d confided in Cyrus about her first crush on another girl, their relationship had deepened. Buffy and Andi were still his best friends, of course, but it was nice to have someone who really understood what he was going through.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Amber clapped her hands together, a sly grin tugging at her glossy pink lips. \u201cLet\u2019s get this party started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think a sleepover counts as a party.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus turned at the sound of the familiar voice, his breath catching at the sight of TJ leaning in the doorway with twinkling eyes. He was wearing a baggy jumper and frayed sweatpants, and his usually immaculate hair was damp and messy from the shower, but Cyrus still couldn\u2019t stop staring. His crush was unfairly gorgeous, after all.</p><p>\u201cHey, Underdog,\u201d TJ greeted him. He bit his bottom lip and smiled \u2013 a gesture that never failed to make Cyrus tremble with the urge to grab his stupid face and press their lips together.</p><p>But instead of jumping the poor guy, he simply said, \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look good today.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus glanced down at his basic shirt and skinny jeans, and struggled to come up with a heterosexual explanation for such an unwarranted compliment. Was TJ blatantly flirting with him on purpose? Did he even care that his older sister was standing right there, shaking her head in disgust?</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Amber gritted her teeth and shoved TJ into the hallway. \u201cThat\u2019s enough, Casanova. Go back to your room.\u201d</p><p>TJ threw one last smile over his shoulder. \u201cSeya, Cy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Um&hellip; B-Bye, TJ!\u201d</p><p>Once she\u2019d successfully banished her brother, Amber glared at Cyrus. \u201cCan you not encourage him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s clearly messing with you to get on my nerves,\u201d she said, huffing a sigh as she tossed the pillows off the couch and onto the floor, making room for the two of them to sit down. \u201cJust ignore him, and he\u2019ll stop.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus deflated slightly. Did Amber really think TJ was only flirting with him to make her angry? It sounded like the sort of thing little brothers did, but what about all the private conversations they\u2019d had at school, when Amber wasn\u2019t around? TJ seemed to flirt with him all the time, regardless of who they were with. Or was he only seeing what he wanted to see? All this thinking was starting to give him a headache&hellip;</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna order some pizza,\u201d Amber told him. \u201cYou can get changed in the downstairs bathroom.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nodded and scuttled off, happy for the distraction.</p><p>A couple hours later, he and Amber were curled up on the couch, making their way through the second season of\u00a0<i>Queer Eye</i>. Empty pizza boxes and cans of diet Coke littered the coffee table, and the smell of pepperoni lingered in the air.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Amber said, her voice strangely high, like she was about to approach a tricky subject, \u201cdo you have a crush on anyone at the moment?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus tore his eyes away from the screen. Amber was looking at him with a feral gleam in her eyes, and her mouth was twisted with a smirk. It was quite unsettling. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is what people do at sleepovers, Cyrus. They talk about their crushes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t have a crush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me who it is!\u201d</p><p>Cyrus snorted. \u201cTrust me, Amber, you don\u2019t wanna know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m intrigued.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, just drop it. I don\u2019t want you to hate me.\u201d</p><p>Amber frowned, and Cyrus was afraid he\u2019d given too much away. He fixed his eyes back on the TV, pointedly ignoring his friend as she moved closer and stuck her nose in his face. She was scrutinising him, searching for any sort of clue in his expression, but Cyrus was determined not to break. If he told Amber about his crush \u2013 if he told<i>\u00a0anyone</i>\u00a0about his crush \u2013 then TJ would eventually find out, and everything would be weird and awkward between them. He didn\u2019t want that.</p><p>Just as Amber opened her mouth to say something, the microwave pinged in the next room.</p><p>\u201cThe popcorn\u2019s ready,\u201d she said, moving off the couch with a sigh. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a sec.\u201d</p><p>As soon as she slipped through the door, Cyrus exhaled a shaky breath. His heartrate was almost back to normal when another body dropped into the space where Amber had been sitting.</p><p>\u201cI hear you have a crush,\u201d TJ grinned.</p><p>Cyrus buried his face in his hands and groaned. \u201cDon\u2019t\u00a0<i>you</i>\u00a0start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna know who my crush is, right? Well, I\u2019m not telling you. It\u2019s private.\u201d</p><p>TJ bit back a smirk and shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Underdog. I have my suspicions already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-You do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d He slung an arm around Cyrus\u2019 shoulders, his smile softening as he flicked his eyes over the younger boy\u2019s face. He looked adorable, and Cyrus couldn\u2019t stand it. \u201cI have a crush too, you know.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus gulped. \u201cOh. Um&hellip; That\u2019s really great, TJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna ask me who it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus licked his lips, daring himself to meet TJ\u2019s unwavering gaze. \u201cI have my suspicions.\u201d</p><p>TJ chuckled. \u201cIf you tell me yours, I\u2019ll tell you mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry,\u201d TJ said, gently cupping the side of Cyrus\u2019 face. He looked strangely vulnerable in that moment, and all Cyrus wanted to do was hold him close and tell him everything was going to be alright. \u201cI mean it, Cy&hellip; If I\u2019m right about your crush, you\u00a0<i>really\u00a0</i>don\u2019t have to worry. Believe me.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus found himself leaning closer to TJ, his eyes trained on the other boy\u2019s mouth. \u201cWhat if you\u2019re wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>TJ pushed Cyrus\u2019 fringe out of his face, his lips twitching with an affectionate smile. \u201cDo\u00a0<i>you</i>\u00a0think I\u2019m wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, um&hellip; I-I don\u2019t know&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you do.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus pressed his palms against TJ\u2019s chest, his fingers splaying across the soft, worn fabric of his jumper. His throat was incredibly dry, and his eyes refused to move away from TJ\u2019s mouth. It was like he was caught in a trance, and he didn\u2019t want to be shaken out of it. He knew Amber would be back any second, but he didn\u2019t care. He wanted this. He wanted\u00a0<i>TJ</i>. And all he had to do was lean forward and \u2013</p><p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d Amber slammed the bowl of popcorn down on the coffee table, her glare aimed directly at TJ. \u201cCan you stop flirting with my guest and leave us alone?\u201d</p><p>TJ sneered. \u201cSeriously, Amber? You couldn\u2019t give us a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNewsflash, baby brother: this is\u00a0<i>my</i>\u00a0sleepover!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d TJ gave Cyrus one last look, his hand lingering on his cheek for a moment before sliding away, then got to his feet. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later, okay?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>As soon as TJ had disappeared, Amber turned her glare on Cyrus. \u201cWhat did I tell you about encouraging him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmber, I \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me he\u2019s your crush.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus stared down at his hands, his cheeks turning warm. His silence must have been answer enough, because Amber suddenly shuddered and covered her mouth, supressing a gag. When he finally found the courage to speak, she simply waved his words away and said, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna hear it. Let\u2019s just eat popcorn, watch TV, and pretend this never happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>An awkward silence settled over them as they returned their attention to\u00a0<i>Queer Eye</i>, their slow crunching of popcorn the only sound filling the space between the show. They were almost finished with the second season when Amber reached over and patted Cyrus\u2019 hand. He was almost certain she was about to break his fingers or dig her nails into his flesh, but instead, she squeezed his hand and smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for giving you a hard time before,\u201d she said, her eyes still watching the screen. \u201cI guess it\u2019s just weird. You\u2019re my only friend, and he\u2019s my only brother. You get what I mean?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nodded. \u201cYeah, I do. I\u2019m sorry for messing things up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d She glanced over at him, her eyes glittering. \u201cYou and TJ are actually perfect for each other. I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t see it before, but&hellip; I think my brother might be smitten with you.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus ducked his head. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it, Cyrus. You know I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI think I\u2019m just scared to admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause then it\u2019ll be real, and that\u2019s when things start to go wrong.\u201d</p><p>Amber grabbed his other hand and looked him dead in the eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ll never know unless you give it a go.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus didn\u2019t know how to respond to that, so he rested his head against Amber\u2019s shoulder and continued to watch TV. Amber didn\u2019t seem to mind; she simply hooked her chin over Cyrus\u2019 head and started to play with his hair. It was her way of saying \u2018I understand you, and I\u2019m here for you\u2019 without having to use any words, and Cyrus was once again reminded why he\u2019d decided to befriend Amber in the first place.</p><p>It was bordering on midnight when Amber fell asleep, her hair sticking to her lips as she breathed loudly against Cyrus\u2019 head. He waited a few minutes \u2013 just to make sure she wasn\u2019t faking it \u2013 then carefully replaced his head with a pillow and lowered her onto the couch.</p><p>Cyrus snuck up the stairs and found the room opposite the bathroom. Behind the door, he could hear the quiet hum of music. It wasn\u2019t anything he\u2019d heard before, but he liked the soothing tone of the song.</p><p>After a while of pacing up and down the corridor, Cyrus worked up the nerve to knock on the door. Almost instantly, the music went quiet, and the sound of socked-feet padded across the floor. Cyrus sucked in a deep breath and prepared himself. He knew, if he hesitated, he\u2019d never manage to say what he wanted to say, which is why he\u2019d decided to take a leap of faith and stop being scared for once in his life.</p><p>TJ opened the door and smiled down at him. \u201cHey, Underdog. What\u2019s \u2013\u201d</p><p>Before TJ could finish his sentence, Cyrus grabbed his stupid face and kissed him, just liked he\u2019d wanted to do for months.</p><p>The older boy stilled against him in shock, his arm still casually draped across the doorway. It wasn\u2019t until Cyrus tugged at his hair that TJ got with the program and kissed him back, his hands roaming all over his body before settling on his waist. He yanked Cyrus closer and kissed him hungrily, his warm breath panting against his mouth. By the time they finally broke apart, neither one of them could breathe properly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you,\u201d Cyrus said between gasps, his fingers still tangled in TJ\u2019s dirty blond waves. \u201cYou\u2019re my crush.\u201d</p><p>TJ cradled his face and smiled. \u201cDitto.\u201d</p>",

            "comment": "<p><h1>It\u2019s You</h1><p><i>Tyrus Month ~ September 1st,\u00a0\u201cSleepover\u201d.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Also available on <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F15866208&amp;t=ZTYwYjk0NmM0OWZjZDIyNGNhODY4ZTNkNDQ5NDljM2Q5OGI2NzdkOSw5ZDY4ODViNWRjNDY1Njk0ZTUyNjFjOGJmMjg4ZGFjZGVjMjA4NDE0\">AO3</a> \u2665</i></p><p>As soon as Amber opened the door and ushered Cyrus inside, his eyes starting scanning every visible square inch of the Kippens\u2019 house, hoping to catch a glimpse of a certain dirty blond-haired boy. When he\u2019d first discovered that TJ and Amber were siblings, he\u2019d been afraid that the dynamics in their relationships would change, but so far, everything seemed to be going okay. Except for the fact that he was now not only harbouring a crush on his best friend\u2019s past nemesis, but also on his new friend\u2019s brother. He was breaking two classic rules right there, and he wasn\u2019t sure how to deal with that.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you looking for?\u201d Amber asked, her perfectly intimidating eyebrows drawn together. She was frowning in amusement as Cyrus strained his neck around every corner, mindlessly searching for TJ, but there was a glimmer of suspicion in her eyes as well. Did she know what was going on?</p><p>Cyrus slapped on a smile and returned his attention to Amber. Technically, he was here to see her anyway, so it would be rude of him to obsess over TJ all night.</p><p>\u201cI was just wondering where the bathroom is?\u201d he lied.</p><p>Amber pursed her lips. For a moment, Cyrus was convinced she was going to confront him about TJ, but then a porcelain smile slipped into place.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one just around the corner,\u201d she said, \u201cand another one opposite TJ\u2019s room upstairs.\u201d</p><p>At the mere mention of TJ\u2019s name, Cyrus\u2019 heart started to beat faster. His crush on the older boy was quickly snowballing into dangerous territory; if he didn\u2019t put a stop to it soon, he was at the risk of falling too far. The only thing that kept him from trying to move on was the small chance that TJ might feel the same way. It was a long shot, but Cyrus had definitely been receiving some not-so-subtle signals from TJ lately, and he was determined to figure out what that meant before he completely dismissed the possibility of his crush being reciprocated.</p><p>\u201cOkay, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need to go now, or\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Amber shot him another suspicious look, then shrugged, tossing her blonde waves over her shoulder as she directed him to the living room. \u201cYou can just dump your stuff on the couch.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled at the collection of basketball trophies adorning the cabinet in the corner of the room, each of them proudly displaying TJ\u2019s name. From the looks of it, they dated back almost nine years. It was adorable to think that TJ had been obsessed with basketball since he was a little kid, and Cyrus couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at the idea of his friend winning games and making his family proud from a young age. He\u2019d always known that TJ was more than just a dumb jock; he had a passion for basketball,\u00a0<i>not</i>\u00a0the bad-boy reputation that came with it.</p><p>\u201cThose are all TJ\u2019s,\u201d Amber said, waving her hand at the cabinet. \u201cI guess my little brother stole all the talent in the family.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus rolled his eyes fondly. \u201cYou\u2019re talented too, Amber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt what? Scaring people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s just one of\u00a0<i>many</i>\u00a0talents you possess.\u201d</p><p>Amber smirked. \u201cYou know, for a gay guy, you really know how to sweet talk a lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Cyrus said with a laugh. Usually, if someone joked about his sexuality, he got anxious and paranoid. But with Amber, it was different. Ever since she\u2019d confided in Cyrus about her first crush on another girl, their relationship had deepened. Buffy and Andi were still his best friends, of course, but it was nice to have someone who really understood what he was going through.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Amber clapped her hands together, a sly grin tugging at her glossy pink lips. \u201cLet\u2019s get this party started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think a sleepover counts as a party.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus turned at the sound of the familiar voice, his breath catching at the sight of TJ leaning in the doorway with twinkling eyes. He was wearing a baggy jumper and frayed sweatpants, and his usually immaculate hair was damp and messy from the shower, but Cyrus still couldn\u2019t stop staring. His crush was unfairly gorgeous, after all.</p><p>\u201cHey, Underdog,\u201d TJ greeted him. He bit his bottom lip and smiled \u2013 a gesture that never failed to make Cyrus tremble with the urge to grab his stupid face and press their lips together.</p><p>But instead of jumping the poor guy, he simply said, \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look good today.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus glanced down at his basic shirt and skinny jeans, and struggled to come up with a heterosexual explanation for such an unwarranted compliment. Was TJ blatantly flirting with him on purpose? Did he even care that his older sister was standing right there, shaking her head in disgust?</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Amber gritted her teeth and shoved TJ into the hallway. \u201cThat\u2019s enough, Casanova. Go back to your room.\u201d</p><p>TJ threw one last smile over his shoulder. \u201cSeya, Cy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Um\u2026 B-Bye, TJ!\u201d</p><p>Once she\u2019d successfully banished her brother, Amber glared at Cyrus. \u201cCan you not encourage him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s clearly messing with you to get on my nerves,\u201d she said, huffing a sigh as she tossed the pillows off the couch and onto the floor, making room for the two of them to sit down. \u201cJust ignore him, and he\u2019ll stop.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus deflated slightly. Did Amber really think TJ was only flirting with him to make her angry? It sounded like the sort of thing little brothers did, but what about all the private conversations they\u2019d had at school, when Amber wasn\u2019t around? TJ seemed to flirt with him all the time, regardless of who they were with. Or was he only seeing what he wanted to see? All this thinking was starting to give him a headache\u2026</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna order some pizza,\u201d Amber told him. \u201cYou can get changed in the downstairs bathroom.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nodded and scuttled off, happy for the distraction.</p><p>A couple hours later, he and Amber were curled up on the couch, making their way through the second season of\u00a0<i>Queer Eye</i>. Empty pizza boxes and cans of diet Coke littered the coffee table, and the smell of pepperoni lingered in the air.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Amber said, her voice strangely high, like she was about to approach a tricky subject, \u201cdo you have a crush on anyone at the moment?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus tore his eyes away from the screen. Amber was looking at him with a feral gleam in her eyes, and her mouth was twisted with a smirk. It was quite unsettling. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is what people do at sleepovers, Cyrus. They talk about their crushes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t have a crush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me who it is!\u201d</p><p>Cyrus snorted. \u201cTrust me, Amber, you don\u2019t wanna know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m intrigued.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, just drop it. I don\u2019t want you to hate me.\u201d</p><p>Amber frowned, and Cyrus was afraid he\u2019d given too much away. He fixed his eyes back on the TV, pointedly ignoring his friend as she moved closer and stuck her nose in his face. She was scrutinising him, searching for any sort of clue in his expression, but Cyrus was determined not to break. If he told Amber about his crush \u2013 if he told<i>\u00a0anyone</i>\u00a0about his crush \u2013 then TJ would eventually find out, and everything would be weird and awkward between them. He didn\u2019t want that.</p><p>Just as Amber opened her mouth to say something, the microwave pinged in the next room.</p><p>\u201cThe popcorn\u2019s ready,\u201d she said, moving off the couch with a sigh. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a sec.\u201d</p><p>As soon as she slipped through the door, Cyrus exhaled a shaky breath. His heartrate was almost back to normal when another body dropped into the space where Amber had been sitting.</p><p>\u201cI hear you have a crush,\u201d TJ grinned.</p><p>Cyrus buried his face in his hands and groaned. \u201cDon\u2019t\u00a0<i>you</i>\u00a0start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna know who my crush is, right? Well, I\u2019m not telling you. It\u2019s private.\u201d</p><p>TJ bit back a smirk and shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Underdog. I have my suspicions already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-You do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d He slung an arm around Cyrus\u2019 shoulders, his smile softening as he flicked his eyes over the younger boy\u2019s face. He looked adorable, and Cyrus couldn\u2019t stand it. \u201cI have a crush too, you know.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus gulped. \u201cOh. Um\u2026 That\u2019s really great, TJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna ask me who it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus licked his lips, daring himself to meet TJ\u2019s unwavering gaze. \u201cI have my suspicions.\u201d</p><p>TJ chuckled. \u201cIf you tell me yours, I\u2019ll tell you mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry,\u201d TJ said, gently cupping the side of Cyrus\u2019 face. He looked strangely vulnerable in that moment, and all Cyrus wanted to do was hold him close and tell him everything was going to be alright. \u201cI mean it, Cy\u2026 If I\u2019m right about your crush, you\u00a0<i>really\u00a0</i>don\u2019t have to worry. Believe me.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus found himself leaning closer to TJ, his eyes trained on the other boy\u2019s mouth. \u201cWhat if you\u2019re wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>TJ pushed Cyrus\u2019 fringe out of his face, his lips twitching with an affectionate smile. \u201cDo\u00a0<i>you</i>\u00a0think I\u2019m wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, um\u2026 I-I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you do.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus pressed his palms against TJ\u2019s chest, his fingers splaying across the soft, worn fabric of his jumper. His throat was incredibly dry, and his eyes refused to move away from TJ\u2019s mouth. It was like he was caught in a trance, and he didn\u2019t want to be shaken out of it. He knew Amber would be back any second, but he didn\u2019t care. He wanted this. He wanted\u00a0<i>TJ</i>. And all he had to do was lean forward and \u2013</p><p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d Amber slammed the bowl of popcorn down on the coffee table, her glare aimed directly at TJ. \u201cCan you stop flirting with my guest and leave us alone?\u201d</p><p>TJ sneered. \u201cSeriously, Amber? You couldn\u2019t give us a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNewsflash, baby brother: this is\u00a0<i>my</i>\u00a0sleepover!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d TJ gave Cyrus one last look, his hand lingering on his cheek for a moment before sliding away, then got to his feet. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later, okay?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>As soon as TJ had disappeared, Amber turned her glare on Cyrus. \u201cWhat did I tell you about encouraging him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmber, I \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me he\u2019s your crush.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus stared down at his hands, his cheeks turning warm. His silence must have been answer enough, because Amber suddenly shuddered and covered her mouth, supressing a gag. When he finally found the courage to speak, she simply waved his words away and said, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna hear it. Let\u2019s just eat popcorn, watch TV, and pretend this never happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>An awkward silence settled over them as they returned their attention to\u00a0<i>Queer Eye</i>, their slow crunching of popcorn the only sound filling the space between the show. They were almost finished with the second season when Amber reached over and patted Cyrus\u2019 hand. He was almost certain she was about to break his fingers or dig her nails into his flesh, but instead, she squeezed his hand and smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for giving you a hard time before,\u201d she said, her eyes still watching the screen. \u201cI guess it\u2019s just weird.

I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t see it before, but\u2026 I think my brother might be smitten with you.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus ducked his head. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it, Cyrus.

When he\u2019d first discovered that TJ and Amber were siblings, he\u2019d been afraid that the dynamics in their relationships would change, but so far, everything seemed to be going okay. Except for the fact that he was now not only harbouring a crush on his best friend\u2019s past nemesis, but also on his new friend\u2019s brother. He was breaking two classic rules right there, and he wasn\u2019t sure how to deal with that.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you looking for?\u201d Amber asked, her perfectly intimidating eyebrows drawn together. She was frowning in amusement as Cyrus strained his neck around every corner, mindlessly searching for TJ, but there was a glimmer of suspicion in her eyes as well. Did she know what was going on?</p><p>Cyrus slapped on a smile and returned his attention to Amber. Technically, he was here to see her anyway, so it would be rude of him to obsess over TJ all night.</p><p>\u201cI was just wondering where the bathroom is?\u201d he lied.</p><p>Amber pursed her lips. For a moment, Cyrus was convinced she was going to confront him about TJ, but then a porcelain smile slipped into place.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one just around the corner,\u201d she said, \u201cand another one opposite TJ\u2019s room upstairs.\u201d</p><p>At the mere mention of TJ\u2019s name, Cyrus\u2019 heart started to beat faster. His crush on the older boy was quickly snowballing into dangerous territory; if he didn\u2019t put a stop to it soon, he was at the risk of falling too far. The only thing that kept him from trying to move on was the small chance that TJ might feel the same way. It was a long shot, but Cyrus had definitely been receiving some not-so-subtle signals from TJ lately, and he was determined to figure out what that meant before he completely dismissed the possibility of his crush being reciprocated.</p><p>\u201cOkay, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need to go now, or\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Amber shot him another suspicious look, then shrugged, tossing her blonde waves over her shoulder as she directed him to the living room. \u201cYou can just dump your stuff on the couch.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled at the collection of basketball trophies adorning the cabinet in the corner of the room, each of them proudly displaying TJ\u2019s name. From the looks of it, they dated back almost nine years. It was adorable to think that TJ had been obsessed with basketball since he was a little kid, and Cyrus couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at the idea of his friend winning games and making his family proud from a young age. He\u2019d always known that TJ was more than just a dumb jock; he had a passion for basketball,\u00a0<i>not</i>\u00a0the bad-boy reputation that came with it.</p><p>\u201cThose are all TJ\u2019s,\u201d Amber said, waving her hand at the cabinet. \u201cI guess my little brother stole all the talent in the family.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus rolled his eyes fondly. \u201cYou\u2019re talented too, Amber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt what? Scaring people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s just one of\u00a0<i>many</i>\u00a0talents you possess.\u201d</p><p>Amber smirked. \u201cYou know, for a gay guy, you really know how to sweet talk a lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Cyrus said with a laugh. Usually, if someone joked about his sexuality, he got anxious and paranoid. But with Amber, it was different. Ever since she\u2019d confided in Cyrus about her first crush on another girl, their relationship had deepened. Buffy and Andi were still his best friends, of course, but it was nice to have someone who really understood what he was going through.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Amber clapped her hands together, a sly grin tugging at her glossy pink lips. \u201cLet\u2019s get this party started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think a sleepover counts as a party.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus turned at the sound of the familiar voice, his breath catching at the sight of TJ leaning in the doorway with twinkling eyes. He was wearing a baggy jumper and frayed sweatpants, and his usually immaculate hair was damp and messy from the shower, but Cyrus still couldn\u2019t stop staring. His crush was unfairly gorgeous, after all.</p><p>\u201cHey, Underdog,\u201d TJ greeted him. He bit his bottom lip and smiled \u2013 a gesture that never failed to make Cyrus tremble with the urge to grab his stupid face and press their lips together.</p><p>But instead of jumping the poor guy, he simply said, \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look good today.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus glanced down at his basic shirt and skinny jeans, and struggled to come up with a heterosexual explanation for such an unwarranted compliment. Was TJ blatantly flirting with him on purpose? Did he even care that his older sister was standing right there, shaking her head in disgust?</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Amber gritted her teeth and shoved TJ into the hallway. \u201cThat\u2019s enough, Casanova. Go back to your room.\u201d</p><p>TJ threw one last smile over his shoulder. \u201cSeya, Cy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Um\u2026 B-Bye, TJ!\u201d</p><p>Once she\u2019d successfully banished her brother, Amber glared at Cyrus. \u201cCan you not encourage him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s clearly messing with you to get on my nerves,\u201d she said, huffing a sigh as she tossed the pillows off the couch and onto the floor, making room for the two of them to sit down. \u201cJust ignore him, and he\u2019ll stop.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus deflated slightly. Did Amber really think TJ was only flirting with him to make her angry? It sounded like the sort of thing little brothers did, but what about all the private conversations they\u2019d had at school, when Amber wasn\u2019t around? TJ seemed to flirt with him all the time, regardless of who they were with. Or was he only seeing what he wanted to see? All this thinking was starting to give him a headache\u2026</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna order some pizza,\u201d Amber told him. \u201cYou can get changed in the downstairs bathroom.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nodded and scuttled off, happy for the distraction.</p><p>A couple hours later, he and Amber were curled up on the couch, making their way through the second season of\u00a0<i>Queer Eye</i>. Empty pizza boxes and cans of diet Coke littered the coffee table, and the smell of pepperoni lingered in the air.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Amber said, her voice strangely high, like she was about to approach a tricky subject, \u201cdo you have a crush on anyone at the moment?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus tore his eyes away from the screen. Amber was looking at him with a feral gleam in her eyes, and her mouth was twisted with a smirk. It was quite unsettling. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is what people do at sleepovers, Cyrus. They talk about their crushes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t have a crush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me who it is!\u201d</p><p>Cyrus snorted. \u201cTrust me, Amber, you don\u2019t wanna know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m intrigued.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, just drop it. I don\u2019t want you to hate me.\u201d</p><p>Amber frowned, and Cyrus was afraid he\u2019d given too much away. He fixed his eyes back on the TV, pointedly ignoring his friend as she moved closer and stuck her nose in his face. She was scrutinising him, searching for any sort of clue in his expression, but Cyrus was determined not to break. If he told Amber about his crush \u2013 if he told<i>\u00a0anyone</i>\u00a0about his crush \u2013 then TJ would eventually find out, and everything would be weird and awkward between them. He didn\u2019t want that.</p><p>Just as Amber opened her mouth to say something, the microwave pinged in the next room.</p><p>\u201cThe popcorn\u2019s ready,\u201d she said, moving off the couch with a sigh. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a sec.\u201d</p><p>As soon as she slipped through the door, Cyrus exhaled a shaky breath. His heartrate was almost back to normal when another body dropped into the space where Amber had been sitting.</p><p>\u201cI hear you have a crush,\u201d TJ grinned.</p><p>Cyrus buried his face in his hands and groaned. \u201cDon\u2019t\u00a0<i>you</i>\u00a0start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna know who my crush is, right? Well, I\u2019m not telling you. It\u2019s private.\u201d</p><p>TJ bit back a smirk and shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Underdog. I have my suspicions already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-You do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d He slung an arm around Cyrus\u2019 shoulders, his smile softening as he flicked his eyes over the younger boy\u2019s face. He looked adorable, and Cyrus couldn\u2019t stand it. \u201cI have a crush too, you know.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus gulped. \u201cOh. Um\u2026 That\u2019s really great, TJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna ask me who it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus licked his lips, daring himself to meet TJ\u2019s unwavering gaze. \u201cI have my suspicions.\u201d</p><p>TJ chuckled. \u201cIf you tell me yours, I\u2019ll tell you mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry,\u201d TJ said, gently cupping the side of Cyrus\u2019 face. He looked strangely vulnerable in that moment, and all Cyrus wanted to do was hold him close and tell him everything was going to be alright. \u201cI mean it, Cy\u2026 If I\u2019m right about your crush, you\u00a0<i>really\u00a0</i>don\u2019t have to worry. Believe me.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus found himself leaning closer to TJ, his eyes trained on the other boy\u2019s mouth. \u201cWhat if you\u2019re wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>TJ pushed Cyrus\u2019 fringe out of his face, his lips twitching with an affectionate smile. \u201cDo\u00a0<i>you</i>\u00a0think I\u2019m wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, um\u2026 I-I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you do.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus pressed his palms against TJ\u2019s chest, his fingers splaying across the soft, worn fabric of his jumper. His throat was incredibly dry, and his eyes refused to move away from TJ\u2019s mouth. It was like he was caught in a trance, and he didn\u2019t want to be shaken out of it. He knew Amber would be back any second, but he didn\u2019t care. He wanted this. He wanted\u00a0<i>TJ</i>. And all he had to do was lean forward and \u2013</p><p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d Amber slammed the bowl of popcorn down on the coffee table, her glare aimed directly at TJ. \u201cCan you stop flirting with my guest and leave us alone?\u201d</p><p>TJ sneered. \u201cSeriously, Amber? You couldn\u2019t give us a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNewsflash, baby brother: this is\u00a0<i>my</i>\u00a0sleepover!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d TJ gave Cyrus one last look, his hand lingering on his cheek for a moment before sliding away, then got to his feet. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later, okay?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>As soon as TJ had disappeared, Amber turned her glare on Cyrus. \u201cWhat did I tell you about encouraging him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmber, I \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me he\u2019s your crush.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus stared down at his hands, his cheeks turning warm. His silence must have been answer enough, because Amber suddenly shuddered and covered her mouth, supressing a gag. When he finally found the courage to speak, she simply waved his words away and said, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna hear it. Let\u2019s just eat popcorn, watch TV, and pretend this never happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>An awkward silence settled over them as they returned their attention to\u00a0<i>Queer Eye</i>, their slow crunching of popcorn the only sound filling the space between the show. They were almost finished with the second season when Amber reached over and patted Cyrus\u2019 hand. He was almost certain she was about to break his fingers or dig her nails into his flesh, but instead, she squeezed his hand and smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for giving you a hard time before,\u201d she said, her eyes still watching the screen. \u201cI guess it\u2019s just weird. You\u2019re my only friend, and he\u2019s my only brother. You get what I mean?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nodded. \u201cYeah, I do. I\u2019m sorry for messing things up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d She glanced over at him, her eyes glittering. \u201cYou and TJ are actually perfect for each other. I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t see it before, but\u2026 I think my brother might be smitten with you.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus ducked his head. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it, Cyrus. You know I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI think I\u2019m just scared to admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause then it\u2019ll be real, and that\u2019s when things start to go wrong.\u201d</p><p>Amber grabbed his other hand and looked him dead in the eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ll never know unless you give it a go.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus didn\u2019t know how to respond to that, so he rested his head against Amber\u2019s shoulder and continued to watch TV. Amber didn\u2019t seem to mind; she simply hooked her chin over Cyrus\u2019 head and started to play with his hair. It was her way of saying \u2018I understand you, and I\u2019m here for you\u2019 without having to use any words, and Cyrus was once again reminded why he\u2019d decided to befriend Amber in the first place.</p><p>It was bordering on midnight when Amber fell asleep, her hair sticking to her lips as she breathed loudly against Cyrus\u2019 head. He waited a few minutes \u2013 just to make sure she wasn\u2019t faking it \u2013 then carefully replaced his head with a pillow and lowered her onto the couch.</p><p>Cyrus snuck up the stairs and found the room opposite the bathroom. Behind the door, he could hear the quiet hum of music. It wasn\u2019t anything he\u2019d heard before, but he liked the soothing tone of the song.</p><p>After a while of pacing up and down the corridor, Cyrus worked up the nerve to knock on the door. Almost instantly, the music went quiet, and the sound of socked-feet padded across the floor. Cyrus sucked in a deep breath and prepared himself. He knew, if he hesitated, he\u2019d never manage to say what he wanted to say, which is why he\u2019d decided to take a leap of faith and stop being scared for once in his life.</p><p>TJ opened the door and smiled down at him. \u201cHey, Underdog. What\u2019s \u2013\u201d</p><p>Before TJ could finish his sentence, Cyrus grabbed his stupid face and kissed him, just liked he\u2019d wanted to do for months.</p><p>The older boy stilled against him in shock, his arm still casually draped across the doorway. It wasn\u2019t until Cyrus tugged at his hair that TJ got with the program and kissed him back, his hands roaming all over his body before settling on his waist. He yanked Cyrus closer and kissed him hungrily, his warm breath panting against his mouth. By the time they finally broke apart, neither one of them could breathe properly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you,\u201d Cyrus said between gasps, his fingers still tangled in TJ\u2019s dirty blond waves. \u201cYou\u2019re my crush.\u201d</p><p>TJ cradled his face and smiled. \u201cDitto.\u201d</p></p>",

All this thinking was starting to give him a headache&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna order some pizza,&rdquo; Amber told him. &ldquo;You can get changed in the downstairs bathroom.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus nodded and scuttled off, happy for the distraction.</p><p>A couple hours later, he and Amber were curled up on the couch, making their way through the second season of&nbsp;<i>Queer Eye</i>. Empty pizza boxes and cans of diet Coke littered the coffee table, and the smell of pepperoni lingered in the air.</p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Amber said, her voice strangely high, like she was about to approach a tricky subject, &ldquo;do you have a crush on anyone at the moment?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus tore his eyes away from the screen. Amber was looking at him with a feral gleam in her eyes, and her mouth was twisted with a smirk. It was quite unsettling. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This is what people do at sleepovers, Cyrus. They talk about their crushes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t have a crush.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Liar.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you want from me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me who it is!&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus snorted. &ldquo;Trust me, Amber, you don&rsquo;t wanna know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m intrigued.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please, just drop it. I don&rsquo;t want you to hate me.&rdquo;</p><p>Amber frowned, and Cyrus was afraid he&rsquo;d given too much away. He fixed his eyes back on the TV, pointedly ignoring his friend as she moved closer and stuck her nose in his face. She was scrutinising him, searching for any sort of clue in his expression, but Cyrus was determined not to break. If he told Amber about his crush &ndash; if he told<i>&nbsp;anyone</i>&nbsp;about his crush &ndash; then TJ would eventually find out, and everything would be weird and awkward between them. He didn&rsquo;t want that.</p><p>Just as Amber opened her mouth to say something, the microwave pinged in the next room.</p><p>&ldquo;The popcorn&rsquo;s ready,&rdquo; she said, moving off the couch with a sigh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in a sec.&rdquo;</p><p>As soon as she slipped through the door, Cyrus exhaled a shaky breath. His heartrate was almost back to normal when another body dropped into the space where Amber had been sitting.</p><p>&ldquo;I hear you have a crush,&rdquo; TJ grinned.</p><p>Cyrus buried his face in his hands and groaned. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&nbsp;<i>you</i>&nbsp;start.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You wanna know who my crush is, right? Well, I&rsquo;m not telling you. It&rsquo;s private.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ bit back a smirk and shrugged. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Underdog. I have my suspicions already.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y-You do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo; He slung an arm around Cyrus&rsquo; shoulders, his smile softening as he flicked his eyes over the younger boy&rsquo;s face. He looked adorable, and Cyrus couldn&rsquo;t stand it. &ldquo;I have a crush too, you know.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus gulped. &ldquo;Oh. Um&hellip; That&rsquo;s really great, TJ.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you gonna ask me who it is?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You what?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus licked his lips, daring himself to meet TJ&rsquo;s unwavering gaze. &ldquo;I have my suspicions.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ chuckled. &ldquo;If you tell me yours, I&rsquo;ll tell you mine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to worry,&rdquo; TJ said, gently cupping the side of Cyrus&rsquo; face. He looked strangely vulnerable in that moment, and all Cyrus wanted to do was hold him close and tell him everything was going to be alright. &ldquo;I mean it, Cy&hellip; If I&rsquo;m right about your crush, you&nbsp;<i>really&nbsp;</i>don&rsquo;t have to worry. Believe me.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus found himself leaning closer to TJ, his eyes trained on the other boy&rsquo;s mouth. &ldquo;What if you&rsquo;re wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ pushed Cyrus&rsquo; fringe out of his face, his lips twitching with an affectionate smile. &ldquo;Do&nbsp;<i>you</i>&nbsp;think I&rsquo;m wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I, um&hellip; I-I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think you do.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus pressed his palms against TJ&rsquo;s chest, his fingers splaying across the soft, worn fabric of his jumper. His throat was incredibly dry, and his eyes refused to move away from TJ&rsquo;s mouth. It was like he was caught in a trance, and he didn&rsquo;t want to be shaken out of it. He knew Amber would be back any second, but he didn&rsquo;t care. He wanted this. He wanted&nbsp;<i>TJ</i>. And all he had to do was lean forward and &ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god.&rdquo; Amber slammed the bowl of popcorn down on the coffee table, her glare aimed directly at TJ. &ldquo;Can you stop flirting with my guest and leave us alone?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ sneered. &ldquo;Seriously, Amber? You couldn&rsquo;t give us a minute?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Newsflash, baby brother: this is&nbsp;<i>my</i>&nbsp;sleepover!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; TJ gave Cyrus one last look, his hand lingering on his cheek for a moment before sliding away, then got to his feet. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk later, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus smiled. &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p><p>As soon as TJ had disappeared, Amber turned her glare on Cyrus. &ldquo;What did I tell you about encouraging him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Amber, I &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t tell me he&rsquo;s your crush.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus stared down at his hands, his cheeks turning warm. His silence must have been answer enough, because Amber suddenly shuddered and covered her mouth, supressing a gag. When he finally found the courage to speak, she simply waved his words away and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wanna hear it. Let&rsquo;s just eat popcorn, watch TV, and pretend this never happened.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Definitely.&rdquo;</p><p>An awkward silence settled over them as they returned their attention to&nbsp;<i>Queer Eye</i>, their slow crunching of popcorn the only sound filling the space between the show. They were almost finished with the second season when Amber reached over and patted Cyrus&rsquo; hand. He was almost certain she was about to break his fingers or dig her nails into his flesh, but instead, she squeezed his hand and smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for giving you a hard time before,&rdquo; she said, her eyes still watching the screen. &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s just weird. You&rsquo;re my only friend, and he&rsquo;s my only brother. You get what I mean?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus nodded. &ldquo;Yeah, I do. I&rsquo;m sorry for messing things up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; She glanced over at him, her eyes glittering. &ldquo;You and TJ are actually perfect for each other. I can&rsquo;t believe I didn&rsquo;t see it before, but&hellip; I think my brother might be smitten with you.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus ducked his head. &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stop it, Cyrus. You know I&rsquo;m right.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo; He shrugged. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m just scared to admit it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because then it&rsquo;ll be real, and that&rsquo;s when things start to go wrong.&rdquo;</p><p>Amber grabbed his other hand and looked him dead in the eyes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never know unless you give it a go.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus didn&rsquo;t know how to respond to that, so he rested his head against Amber&rsquo;s shoulder and continued to watch TV. Amber didn&rsquo;t seem to mind; she simply hooked her chin over Cyrus&rsquo; head and started to play with his hair. It was her way of saying &lsquo;I understand you, and I&rsquo;m here for you&rsquo; without having to use any words, and Cyrus was once again reminded why he&rsquo;d decided to befriend Amber in the first place.</p><p>It was bordering on midnight when Amber fell asleep, her hair sticking to her lips as she breathed loudly against Cyrus&rsquo; head. He waited a few minutes &ndash; just to make sure she wasn&rsquo;t faking it &ndash; then carefully replaced his head with a pillow and lowered her onto the couch.</p><p>Cyrus snuck up the stairs and found the room opposite the bathroom. Behind the door, he could hear the quiet hum of music. It wasn&rsquo;t anything he&rsquo;d heard before, but he liked the soothing tone of the song.</p><p>After a while of pacing up and down the corridor, Cyrus worked up the nerve to knock on the door. Almost instantly, the music went quiet, and the sound of socked-feet padded across the floor. Cyrus sucked in a deep breath and prepared himself. He knew, if he hesitated, he&rsquo;d never manage to say what he wanted to say, which is why he&rsquo;d decided to take a leap of faith and stop being scared for once in his life.</p><p>TJ opened the door and smiled down at him. &ldquo;Hey, Underdog. What&rsquo;s &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>Before TJ could finish his sentence, Cyrus grabbed his stupid face and kissed him, just liked he&rsquo;d wanted to do for months.</p><p>The older boy stilled against him in shock, his arm still casually draped across the doorway. It wasn&rsquo;t until Cyrus tugged at his hair that TJ got with the program and kissed him back, his hands roaming all over his body before settling on his waist. He yanked Cyrus closer and kissed him hungrily, his warm breath panting against his mouth. By the time they finally broke apart, neither one of them could breathe properly.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you,&rdquo; Cyrus said between gasps, his fingers still tangled in TJ&rsquo;s dirty blond waves. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my crush.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ cradled his face and smiled. &ldquo;Ditto.&rdquo;</p></p>",

She didn&rsquo;t even have to pretend to abstain from coffee \nanymore, because the smell of it alone turned her stomach. <br/></p><!-- more --><p>On the day of \nher eleven week ultrasound, Bex had already finished two points of her \nmorning routine, and grabbed some clean clothes from the hall closet. \nShe retreated to the bathroom, the only place in the apartment where she\n had any real privacy, and started to get dressed. She pulled her shirt \nover her head and slipped on her favorite jeans. They were full of \nholes, naturally, which never ceased to confound her mother. Celia never\n could understand why anyone would pay money for clothes with holes in \nit (or ninety-percent of Bex&rsquo;s remaining wardrobe, for that matter). At \nthirty years old, Bex still got satisfaction out of wearing and doing \nthings her mother wouldn&rsquo;t approve of, the same as when she was an \nadolescent. Except now, she didn&rsquo;t have to sneak her <i>cool </i>clothes to school in her backpack, and change out of her &lsquo;mom-approved&rsquo; clothes in the girl&rsquo;s room before homeroom.<br/></p><p>She tugged her jeans up \nand tried to button them around her waist, but they had less give than \nusual. They were actually snug. She stood still, her heartbeat speeding \nup with excitement. Then, she rose on her tiptoes, trying to see her \nwaist in the small bathroom mirror. When she couldn&rsquo;t , she hurried to \nAndi&rsquo;s room.</p><p>&ldquo;I need your mirror,&rdquo; she said breathlessly.<br/></p><p>Andi was combing her \nhair in front of the large mirror over her dresser. She glanced at her \nmother in the doorway. &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you wearing pants?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hold that thought.&rdquo; She\n lifted up her shirt and studied her abdomen from the front and the \nside. It wasn&rsquo;t her imagination. She was getting a baby bump. She sucked\n in her breath excitedly. It was small and hardly noticeable, but it was\n definitely there. She placed her hands on her stomach, unable to tear \nher eyes from the mirror.</p><p>&ldquo;Mom?&rdquo; Andi asked. &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Andi, I have a baby bump!&rdquo; she squealed. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;</p><p>Andi looked down at her mother&rsquo;s stomach. &ldquo;I see it,&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so cool.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have to show Bowie,&rdquo; she said, rushing out of the room, Andi following close behind.</p><p>Her husband was in the \nkitchen, making breakfast. &ldquo;Bowie,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Guess what?&rdquo; She put her \nhands on his shoulders, barely able to contain her smile.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; he asked. He looked her up and down. &ldquo;And where are your pants?&rdquo;</p><p>She ignored his last question. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting a baby bump,&rdquo; she grinned, raising her shirt to show him.</p><p>Bowie looked down at the\n small swell of her belly. &ldquo;Aww,&rdquo; he gushed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the cutest thing \nI&rsquo;ve ever seen.&rdquo; He placed both his hand on her stomach. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t \nbelieve our baby&rsquo;s in there. It feels so unreal.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just wait until you see the sonogram today&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the most amazing feeling in the world.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait,&rdquo; he said, planting a kiss right in the middle of her forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;Mom,&rdquo; said Andi, quietly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget, I&rsquo;m going shopping with Cece after school today.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t forgotten,&rdquo; Bex told her. &ldquo;What are you guys shopping for? Do you want me to come with you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Andi said too quickly. She slapped her hands over her mouth. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t come, and I can&rsquo;t tell you what we&rsquo;re buying.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Bex nodded knowingly. &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s a surprise for me?&rdquo; <br/></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying anymore,&rdquo; Andi told her firmly, zipping her lips with an invisible zipper.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;What <i>is </i>it?&rdquo; Bex\n cried, taking Andi in her arms and tickling her sides until her \ndaughter burst out in a fit of giggles. &ldquo;Tell meeeee! You know I hate \nsuspense!&rdquo;<br/></p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Andi gasped through her laughter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already said too much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; Bex pretended to pout.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see soon enough,&rdquo; Andi promised, still laughing. &ldquo;Now I have to go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have a good day!&rdquo; Bex called, as her daughter hurried out the door.</p><p>*****<br/></p><p>Sonograms were still \nvery much like Bex remembered from her first pregnancy. The gel was \nstill cold, anyway. And it still felt weird when the ultrasound \ntechnician spread it on her belly. But she was a lot calmer this time \naround, and she wasn&rsquo;t alone. She had Bowie with her, sitting beside \nher, holding her hand. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;Baby Quinn is looking \ngreat,&rdquo; the young technician said with a smile. &ldquo;Everything looks perfect.&rdquo; \nShe moved the paddle around Bex&rsquo;s stomach, trying to get the best view. \n&ldquo;Take a look at your baby.&rdquo;</p><p>Bex and Bowie studied \nthe fuzzy image on the screen. At her first sonogram, the fetus didn&rsquo;t \nlook like much, just a white splotch. But now, it was starting to \ndevelop features, and look like a tiny person. They could clearly make \nout the baby&rsquo;s shape. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so cool,&rdquo; Bowie \nbreathed. &ldquo;Look at that. That&rsquo;s our child.&rdquo; He stroked her palm with his\n thumb, unable to tear his eyes away from the screen. Bex was equally \nentranced. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;Is this your first child?&rdquo; the technician asked them.</p><p>&ldquo;We have a daughter,&rdquo; Bex told her.</p><p>&ldquo;Aww. How old is she?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She just turned fourteen,&rdquo; Bex answered, still transfixed on the image of the baby inside her.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh. Wow.&rdquo; The woman \nstudied them carefully, and Bex knew she was trying to figure out how \nold they were, even wondering if Bex had meant to say <i>four </i>instead of <i>fourteen</i>.\n She didn&rsquo;t bother explaining the situation. She was fully aware that \nshe and Bowie were the age when most couples would just be having their \nfirst child. She knew that being teen parents would always carry a \nstigma, or at least raise eyebrows, but she did her best to ignore it. \nTheir family was different than a lot of families in Shadyside, but \ntheir love for their little girl wasn&rsquo;t. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;Is she excited to be a big sister?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s thrilled,&rdquo; Bowie said, beaming with pride. &ldquo;And I know she&rsquo;s going to be great at it. she&rsquo;s an amazing kid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s wonderful,&rdquo; the woman said with a genuine smile. &ldquo;Both mother and baby&rsquo;s heartbeats are strong. Would you like to hear?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d love to,&rdquo; Bex \nsaid. She squeezed Bowie&rsquo;s hand. She was so excited for him. She&rsquo;d been \nthrough this magical moment before, when she first heard Andi&rsquo;s \nheartbeat fourteen years ago, and the life growing inside her became \nreal. It was something she&rsquo;d never forgotten, and never would as long as\n she lived. It changed her forever. The moment she heard Andi&rsquo;s \nheartbeat, she instantly went from being a selfish kid, to loving \nsomeone selflessly. She couldn&rsquo;t wait for her husband to experience it \nfor himself. It was all new to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; the woman said. <br/></p><p>Suddenly, the room \nfilled with what sounded like galloping horses, a harmony of Bex&rsquo;s \nslower heartbeat, and the baby&rsquo;s faster one. Even though it wasn&rsquo;t Bex&rsquo;s\n first time hearing her child&rsquo;s beating heart, her eyes filled with \ntears. They pooled over, running down her neck. \u00a0She turned to look at \nBowie. <br/></p><p>Tears were streaming \ndown his face. Her heart swelled with love for her sweet, amazing \nhusband. She only wished Andi were there to experience it with them. \nTheir daughter was all that was missing from a perfect moment.</p><p>*****<br/></p><p>Andi always felt at home\n in the craft store. It had the same feel as Andi Shack. She could \nliterally spend all day exploring the aisles and never get bored. She \nhad a spring in her step as she and Cece walked through the automatic \ndoors, and were met with her favorite store&rsquo;s familiar potpourri scent. \nAnd she was even more excited because before they left, Pops had slipped\n her a twenty dollar bill and told her to buy herself something. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to start with the yarn?&rdquo; Cece asked, always business first.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Andi nodded, \nlooking around, trying to take in everything around her. She was drawn \nto the bead section, and made a mental note to come back to it later.</p><p>They walked to the yarn \nsection. The aisle stretched out before Andi, every color and texture \nimaginable. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the baby yarn,&rdquo; Cece said. &ldquo;Do you see anything you \nlike?&rdquo;</p><p>Andi chewed her lip as \nshe looked over the skeins of yarn, all in soft pastel colors. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; \nshe finally said, choosing a variegated yarn, a mixture of white and \nseveral shades of pale blue. The picture on the label showed a finished \nbaby blanket that reminded her of sea glass. When it was woven together,\n the pattern of the yarn worked out in uneven, patchy stripes. She \nimagined the blanket in the picture swaddling her new baby brother. \n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfect!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure you don&rsquo;t \nwant something more gender neutral?&rdquo; Cece asked skeptically. &ldquo;This green\n is lovely.&rdquo; She touched a skein of minty green yarn.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I like the blue,&rdquo; Andi insisted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfect for a boy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And how do you know it&rsquo;s going to be a boy?&rdquo; Cece asked. &ldquo;Your mother doesn&rsquo;t even know the baby&rsquo;s gender yet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I just know,&rdquo; Andi said. &ldquo;Sister&rsquo;s instinct.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Honey, I just don&rsquo;t \nwant you to put all your eggs in one basket,&rdquo; Cece told her. &ldquo;I know \nyou&rsquo;re hoping the baby will be a boy, but it may not be. I really think \nyou&rsquo;d be better off choosing green or yellow, or even this multi-colored\n yarn here.&rdquo; She held up another variegated yarn in pastel rainbow hues.</p><p>&ldquo;Please, Cece?&rdquo; Andi \npleaded, clasping her hands together. She was holding onto the hope that\n her sibling would be a boy, and she refused to let it go. In the back \nof her mind, she hoped buying &ldquo;boy&rdquo; yarn would sway the universe in her \nfavor.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Cece sighed. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re sure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Andi said, giving her a hug. <br/></p><p>Cece also picked out a \npair of knitting needles for Andi and a simple, beginner&rsquo;s pattern for a\n blanket. And before they checked out, Andi chose some new beads, and \nseveral rolls of duct tape. Their shopping trip was a success.</p><p>*****<br/></p><p>When they got back to Pops and Cece&rsquo;s house, Andi and Cece went out back to Andi Shack. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll start the blanket for you,&rdquo; Cece offered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll get the hang of it quickly. You&rsquo;re so good at these things.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi watched closely as \nher grandmother put on her glasses and began to knit, and she listened \nas the older woman patiently explained what she was doing.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you ready to try now?&rdquo; Cece asked her at last.</p><p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; Andi said, tentatively, as her grandmother handed her the needles. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;Give it a try. I&rsquo;m right here if you need any help.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi made a stitch, imitating what Cece had done.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Cece praised. <br/></p><p>She frowned. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look as good as yours, though.&rdquo; She wanted every stitch to be perfect for such an important gift.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;Make it a little looser,&rdquo; her grandmother corrected.</p><p>They worked side by \nside. Andi dropped more than a few stitches, but Cece helped her take \nthem out and fix them. It was cozy, just the two of them. And soon, they\n had finished almost two whole rows.</p><p>Andi jumped when there was a knock on the door of Andi Shack. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;Andi?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Bex!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come in!&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right out!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; her mother answered.</p><p>Andi carefully tucked \nthe blanket and yarn away in a trunk and set her knitting needles on top\n of them. Then, she and Cece ducked under the doorway, into the \nbackyard. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;There you are,&rdquo; Bex smiled. &ldquo;Working on my surprise? Can I have a hint?&rdquo; She elbowed Andi playfully in the side.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;Mom!&rdquo; Andi cried, giggling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not telling you what it is. So don&rsquo;t even try to get it out of me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t dream of it,&rdquo; she winked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just teasing you.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Andi nodded. &ldquo;Because what happens in Andi Shack <i>stays </i>in Andi Shack.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Andi Mack and the Crafting Shack of Secrets,&rdquo; Bex said dramatically.</p><p>&ldquo;Mom,&rdquo; Andi groaned at her mother&rsquo;s joke, laughing as Bex reached out to brush her hair back from her forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;How did your appointment go today?&rdquo; Cece asked her daughter.</p><p>&ldquo;It went great!&rdquo; Bex told her. &ldquo;The baby is doing fine. And look!&rdquo; She turned so her mother could see her from the side.</p><p>&ldquo;How adorable,&quot;Cece grinned. &quot;And look at you! You&rsquo;re glowing!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have to get some maternity clothes soon,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I noticed my clothes are getting tight.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>&ldquo;Are you having enough sex?&rdquo; Cece asked her, seriously.</p><p>&ldquo;Mom! What the <i>heck?!&rdquo; </i>Bex cried, horrified. She felt herself blush, even though she was used to her mother&rsquo;s personal questions.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s healthy for the baby,&rdquo; Cece said matter-of-factly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s scientifically proven. Ask your doctor!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bowie and I are fine in that area,&rdquo; she assured her. &ldquo;Not that it&rsquo;s any of your business.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;d better not be riding that two-wheeled death machine of yours,&rdquo; Cece went on, unfazed.</p><p>&ldquo;You mean my motorcycle?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Cece \nnodded. &ldquo;You know how I feel about you riding that thing alone, Rebecca,\n but now you&rsquo;re carrying my grandchild.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, mom,&rdquo; Bex \nsaid, softening. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t ride it. I promise.&rdquo; She took the sonogram \npicture out of her pocket. &ldquo;Look at this, you guys.&rdquo; She held the print \nout to show her mother and daughter.</p><p>Cece put her glasses back on. &ldquo;Aww,&rdquo; she gushed, studying the picture closely. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s precious.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the baby&rsquo;s head, and here&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s legs,&rdquo; Bex said to Andi, pointing out the fetus&rsquo;s shape in the grainy image.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; Andi breathed. &ldquo;It looks so small.&rdquo;</p><p>Bex nodded. &ldquo;According to the doctor, it&rsquo;s only about the size of a lime right now. Can you believe you were that small once?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Andi shook her head. &ldquo;Do you know if it&rsquo;s a boy or a girl?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too soon to tell,&rdquo; her mother explained. &ldquo;Next time I go, we should be able to find out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think the baby has Bowie&rsquo;s cheeks,&rdquo; Cece offered.</p><p>Andi titled her head to the side, thoughtfully. &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mark my words,&rdquo; Cece \nnodded. &ldquo;We have a little Bowie on the way.&rdquo; She squeezed Andi&rsquo;s \nshoulder. &ldquo;And you look more and more like Bex every day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thats a huge \ncompliment,&rdquo; Andi smiled, glancing at her mom. She wanted nothing more \nthan to grow up to be as fun, cool, and beautiful as her mother was.<br/></p><p>Bex took Andi&rsquo;s hand in \nhers and squeezed it. &ldquo;Well, mini-me. You ready to go home? Your dad \nwants to have an indoor picnic tonight, and I&rsquo;m starving.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; Andi said. <br/></p><p>*****<br/></p><p>When they got home, \nAndi, Bex, and Bowie spread their takeout dinner out on the living room \nfloor, and ate on piles of pillows, surrounded by the soft flicker of \nBowie&rsquo;s candle collection. Indoor picnics were a family tradition; they \nhad them at least twice a month. <br/></p><p>While they ate their \nChinese food, Andi told her parents about Cyrus&rsquo; latest installment of \nTater Theater, and Bowie told them about the eight-year-old he just \nstarted giving guitar lessons to at The Red Rooster. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;Can we watch a movie?&rdquo; Andi asked, once they were finished cleaning up.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why not,&rdquo; Bex said. &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Friday night. Go get into your PJ&rsquo;s, and we&rsquo;ll pick something out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing scary,&rdquo; Andi reminded her, as she started toward her room. Her parents loved horror films, but she hated them.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;You mean you don&rsquo;t want to watch the sequel to <i>Shh!?&rdquo; </i>Bex asked with a mischievous wink.</p><p>&ldquo;No way!&rdquo; Andi cried. &ldquo;The first one scarred me for life, thank you very much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Bowie said excitedly, turning to his wife. &ldquo;They made a sequel to <i>Shh!?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Bex nodded. &ldquo;Oh, yeah! This time, the psychotic librarian hunts down her victims from a traveling bookmobile. <i>She&rsquo;s evil on wheels&hellip;&rdquo;</i> she added in a deep voice, imitating the narrator from the movie trailer.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;How did I not know that?&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;We have to watch it sometime!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am <i>not </i>listening to you guys,&rdquo; Andi said, plugging her ears and hurrying into her room.</p><p>When she returned, her \nmom and dad were sitting on the couch, waiting for her. Bowie had made a\n bowl of popcorn, even though they&rsquo;d just eaten a huge meal. The candles\n were blown out, and the room was darkened. <br/></p><p>She sat down between her\n parents, and snuggled under the blanket they were sharing. Thankfully, \nfor Andi&rsquo;s sake, they&rsquo;d chosen a reasonable PG13 movie to watch, with \nnothing too gory or violent. As the movie started, though, Andi found \nshe was having trouble getting into it. She tried, but her mind kept \nwandering elsewhere. <br/></p><p>She glanced over at Bex,\n who was softly rubbing her baby bump, her eyes trained on the TV, and \ndoubt began to creep into her heart, even though she didn&rsquo;t want it to. \nAndi loved her mom and dad so much, and some of the happiest times she&rsquo;d\n ever had in her whole life were nights like these, when it was just the\n three of them together in the apartment, dancing, watching movies, \ncooking, eating&hellip; it didn&rsquo;t matter what they did, or how simple it was.\n They always had a great time. And she was struck with the realization \nthat in a few short months, things would never be the same. It would \nnever be just the three of them again. There would be a baby in the \nhouse, demanding Bex and Bowie&rsquo;s time, love, and attention. Life as she \nknew it was about to change once again.</p><p>She tried to squelch her\n bad feelings, and focus on the movie, but she couldn&rsquo;t. The TV screen \nblurred as her eyes filled with tears. Ashamed of herself, she tried to \nhold them back so her parents wouldn&rsquo;t see, but her eyes still stung, \nand her sadness still burned in her chest. <br/></p><p>She was pulled from her \nnegative thoughts when she felt Bex reach out and pat her on the knee. \nWith a soft sigh, she cuddled closer to her mom and rested her head on \nher chest, needing to feel her arms around her. She could hear Bex&rsquo;s \nheart beating, and wondered if the baby was listening to it too, from \nthe inside. <br/></p>",

They could clearly make \nout the baby\u2019s shape. <br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so cool,\u201d Bowie \nbreathed. \u201cLook at that. That\u2019s our child.\u201d He stroked her palm with his\n thumb, unable to tear his eyes away from the screen. Bex was equally \nentranced. <br></p><p>\u201cIs this your first child?\u201d the technician asked them.</p><p>\u201cWe have a daughter,\u201d Bex told her.</p><p>\u201cAww. How old is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe just turned fourteen,\u201d Bex answered, still transfixed on the image of the baby inside her.</p><p>\u201cOh. Wow.\u201d The woman \nstudied them carefully, and Bex knew she was trying to figure out how \nold they were, even wondering if Bex had meant to say <i>four </i>instead of <i>fourteen</i>.\n She didn\u2019t bother explaining the situation. She was fully aware that \nshe and Bowie were the age when most couples would just be having their \nfirst child. She knew that being teen parents would always carry a \nstigma, or at least raise eyebrows, but she did her best to ignore it. \nTheir family was different than a lot of families in Shadyside, but \ntheir love for their little girl wasn\u2019t. <br></p><p>\u201cIs she excited to be a big sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s thrilled,\u201d Bowie said, beaming with pride. \u201cAnd I know she\u2019s going to be great at it. she\u2019s an amazing kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful,\u201d the woman said with a genuine smile. \u201cBoth mother and baby\u2019s heartbeats are strong. Would you like to hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d love to,\u201d Bex \nsaid. She squeezed Bowie\u2019s hand. She was so excited for him. She\u2019d been \nthrough this magical moment before, when she first heard Andi\u2019s \nheartbeat fourteen years ago, and the life growing inside her became \nreal. It was something she\u2019d never forgotten, and never would as long as\n she lived. It changed her forever. The moment she heard Andi\u2019s \nheartbeat, she instantly went from being a selfish kid, to loving \nsomeone selflessly. She couldn\u2019t wait for her husband to experience it \nfor himself. It was all new to him.</p><p>\u201cHere it is,\u201d the woman said. <br></p><p>Suddenly, the room \nfilled with what sounded like galloping horses, a harmony of Bex\u2019s \nslower heartbeat, and the baby\u2019s faster one. Even though it wasn\u2019t Bex\u2019s\n first time hearing her child\u2019s beating heart, her eyes filled with \ntears. They pooled over, running down her neck. \u00a0She turned to look at \nBowie. <br></p><p>Tears were streaming \ndown his face. Her heart swelled with love for her sweet, amazing \nhusband. She only wished Andi were there to experience it with them. \nTheir daughter was all that was missing from a perfect moment.</p><p>*****<br></p><p>Andi always felt at home\n in the craft store. It had the same feel as Andi Shack. She could \nliterally spend all day exploring the aisles and never get bored. She \nhad a spring in her step as she and Cece walked through the automatic \ndoors, and were met with her favorite store\u2019s familiar potpourri scent. \nAnd she was even more excited because before they left, Pops had slipped\n her a twenty dollar bill and told her to buy herself something. <br></p><p>\u201cDo you want to start with the yarn?\u201d Cece asked, always business first.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Andi nodded, \nlooking around, trying to take in everything around her. She was drawn \nto the bead section, and made a mental note to come back to it later.</p><p>They walked to the yarn \nsection. The aisle stretched out before Andi, every color and texture \nimaginable. \u201cHere\u2019s the baby yarn,\u201d Cece said. \u201cDo you see anything you \nlike?\u201d</p><p>Andi chewed her lip as \nshe looked over the skeins of yarn, all in soft pastel colors. \u201cThis,\u201d \nshe finally said, choosing a variegated yarn, a mixture of white and \nseveral shades of pale blue. The picture on the label showed a finished \nbaby blanket that reminded her of sea glass. When it was woven together,\n the pattern of the yarn worked out in uneven, patchy stripes. She \nimagined the blanket in the picture swaddling her new baby brother. \n\u201cIt\u2019s perfect!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t \nwant something more gender neutral?\u201d Cece asked skeptically. \u201cThis green\n is lovely.\u201d She touched a skein of minty green yarn.</p><p>\u201cNo, I like the blue,\u201d Andi insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect for a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you know it\u2019s going to be a boy?\u201d Cece asked. \u201cYour mother doesn\u2019t even know the baby\u2019s gender yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just know,\u201d Andi said. \u201cSister\u2019s instinct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, I just don\u2019t \nwant you to put all your eggs in one basket,\u201d Cece told her. \u201cI know \nyou\u2019re hoping the baby will be a boy, but it may not be. I really think \nyou\u2019d be better off choosing green or yellow, or even this multi-colored\n yarn here.\u201d She held up another variegated yarn in pastel rainbow hues.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Cece?\u201d Andi \npleaded, clasping her hands together. She was holding onto the hope that\n her sibling would be a boy, and she refused to let it go. In the back \nof her mind, she hoped buying \u201cboy\u201d yarn would sway the universe in her \nfavor.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Cece sighed. \u201cIf you\u2019re sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Andi said, giving her a hug. <br></p><p>Cece also picked out a \npair of knitting needles for Andi and a simple, beginner\u2019s pattern for a\n blanket. And before they checked out, Andi chose some new beads, and \nseveral rolls of duct tape. Their shopping trip was a success.</p><p>*****<br></p><p>When they got back to Pops and Cece\u2019s house, Andi and Cece went out back to Andi Shack. <br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll start the blanket for you,\u201d Cece offered. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get the hang of it quickly. You\u2019re so good at these things.\u201d</p><p>Andi watched closely as \nher grandmother put on her glasses and began to knit, and she listened \nas the older woman patiently explained what she was doing.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to try now?\u201d Cece asked her at last.</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d Andi said, tentatively, as her grandmother handed her the needles. <br></p><p>\u201cGive it a try. I\u2019m right here if you need any help.\u201d</p><p>Andi made a stitch, imitating what Cece had done.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Cece praised. <br></p><p>She frowned. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look as good as yours, though.\u201d She wanted every stitch to be perfect for such an important gift.<br></p><p>\u201cMake it a little looser,\u201d her grandmother corrected.</p><p>They worked side by \nside. Andi dropped more than a few stitches, but Cece helped her take \nthem out and fix them. It was cozy, just the two of them. And soon, they\n had finished almost two whole rows.</p><p>Andi jumped when there was a knock on the door of Andi Shack. <br></p><p>\u201cAndi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Bex!\u201d she gasped. \u201cDon\u2019t come in!\u201d she called. \u201cI\u2019ll be right out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d her mother answered.</p><p>Andi carefully tucked \nthe blanket and yarn away in a trunk and set her knitting needles on top\n of them. Then, she and Cece ducked under the doorway, into the \nbackyard. <br></p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d Bex smiled. \u201cWorking on my surprise? Can I have a hint?\u201d She elbowed Andi playfully in the side.<br></p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d Andi cried, giggling. \u201cI\u2019m not telling you what it is. So don\u2019t even try to get it out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of it,\u201d she winked. \u201cI\u2019m just teasing you.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Andi nodded. \u201cBecause what happens in Andi Shack <i>stays </i>in Andi Shack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndi Mack and the Crafting Shack of Secrets,\u201d Bex said dramatically.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Andi groaned at her mother\u2019s joke, laughing as Bex reached out to brush her hair back from her forehead.</p><p>\u201cHow did your appointment go today?\u201d Cece asked her daughter.</p><p>\u201cIt went great!\u201d Bex told her. \u201cThe baby is doing fine. And look!\u201d She turned so her mother could see her from the side.</p><p>\u201cHow adorable,\"Cece grinned. \"And look at you! You\u2019re glowing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have to get some maternity clothes soon,\u201d she said. \u201cI noticed my clothes are getting tight.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAre you having enough sex?\u201d Cece asked her, seriously.</p><p>\u201cMom! What the <i>heck?!\u201d </i>Bex cried, horrified. She felt herself blush, even though she was used to her mother\u2019s personal questions.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s healthy for the baby,\u201d Cece said matter-of-factly. \u201cIt\u2019s scientifically proven. Ask your doctor!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBowie and I are fine in that area,\u201d she assured her. \u201cNot that it\u2019s any of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019d better not be riding that two-wheeled death machine of yours,\u201d Cece went on, unfazed.</p><p>\u201cYou mean my motorcycle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Cece \nnodded. \u201cYou know how I feel about you riding that thing alone, Rebecca,\n but now you\u2019re carrying my grandchild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, mom,\u201d Bex \nsaid, softening. \u201cI won\u2019t ride it. I promise.\u201d She took the sonogram \npicture out of her pocket. \u201cLook at this, you guys.\u201d She held the print \nout to show her mother and daughter.</p><p>Cece put her glasses back on. \u201cAww,\u201d she gushed, studying the picture closely. \u201cIt\u2019s precious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the baby\u2019s head, and here\u2019s it\u2019s legs,\u201d Bex said to Andi, pointing out the fetus\u2019s shape in the grainy image.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Andi breathed. \u201cIt looks so small.\u201d</p><p>Bex nodded. \u201cAccording to the doctor, it\u2019s only about the size of a lime right now. Can you believe you were that small once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Andi shook her head. \u201cDo you know if it\u2019s a boy or a girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too soon to tell,\u201d her mother explained. \u201cNext time I go, we should be able to find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the baby has Bowie\u2019s cheeks,\u201d Cece offered.</p><p>Andi titled her head to the side, thoughtfully. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMark my words,\u201d Cece \nnodded. \u201cWe have a little Bowie on the way.\u201d She squeezed Andi\u2019s \nshoulder. \u201cAnd you look more and more like Bex every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThats a huge \ncompliment,\u201d Andi smiled, glancing at her mom. She wanted nothing more \nthan to grow up to be as fun, cool, and beautiful as her mother was.<br></p><p>Bex took Andi\u2019s hand in \nhers and squeezed it. \u201cWell, mini-me. You ready to go home? Your dad \nwants to have an indoor picnic tonight, and I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I,\u201d Andi said. <br></p><p>*****<br></p><p>When they got home, \nAndi, Bex, and Bowie spread their takeout dinner out on the living room \nfloor, and ate on piles of pillows, surrounded by the soft flicker of \nBowie\u2019s candle collection. Indoor picnics were a family tradition; they \nhad them at least twice a month. <br></p><p>While they ate their \nChinese food, Andi told her parents about Cyrus\u2019 latest installment of \nTater Theater, and Bowie told them about the eight-year-old he just \nstarted giving guitar lessons to at The Red Rooster. <br></p><p>\u201cCan we watch a movie?\u201d Andi asked, once they were finished cleaning up.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why not,\u201d Bex said. \u201cit\u2019s Friday night. Go get into your PJ\u2019s, and we\u2019ll pick something out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing scary,\u201d Andi reminded her, as she started toward her room. Her parents loved horror films, but she hated them.<br></p><p>\u201cYou mean you don\u2019t want to watch the sequel to <i>Shh!?\u201d </i>Bex asked with a mischievous wink.</p><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d Andi cried. \u201cThe first one scarred me for life, thank you very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Bowie said excitedly, turning to his wife. \u201cThey made a sequel to <i>Shh!?\u201d</i></p><p>Bex nodded. \u201cOh, yeah! This time, the psychotic librarian hunts down her victims from a traveling bookmobile. <i>She\u2019s evil on wheels\u2026\u201d</i> she added in a deep voice, imitating the narrator from the movie trailer.<br></p><p>\u201cHow did I not know that?\u201d he gasped. \u201cWe have to watch it sometime!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am <i>not </i>listening to you guys,\u201d Andi said, plugging her ears and hurrying into her room.</p><p>When she returned, her \nmom and dad were sitting on the couch, waiting for her. Bowie had made a\n bowl of popcorn, even though they\u2019d just eaten a huge meal. The candles\n were blown out, and the room was darkened. <br></p><p>She sat down between her\n parents, and snuggled under the blanket they were sharing. Thankfully, \nfor Andi\u2019s sake, they\u2019d chosen a reasonable PG13 movie to watch, with \nnothing too gory or violent. As the movie started, though, Andi found \nshe was having trouble getting into it. She tried, but her mind kept \nwandering elsewhere. <br></p><p>She glanced over at Bex,\n who was softly rubbing her baby bump, her eyes trained on the TV, and \ndoubt began to creep into her heart, even though she didn\u2019t want it to. \nAndi loved her mom and dad so much, and some of the happiest times she\u2019d\n ever had in her whole life were nights like these, when it was just the\n three of them together in the apartment, dancing, watching movies, \ncooking, eating\u2026 it didn\u2019t matter what they did, or how simple it was.\n They always had a great time. And she was struck with the realization \nthat in a few short months, things would never be the same. It would \nnever be just the three of them again. There would be a baby in the \nhouse, demanding Bex and Bowie\u2019s time, love, and attention. Life as she \nknew it was about to change once again.</p><p>She tried to squelch her\n bad feelings, and focus on the movie, but she couldn\u2019t. The TV screen \nblurred as her eyes filled with tears. Ashamed of herself, she tried to \nhold them back so her parents wouldn\u2019t see, but her eyes still stung, \nand her sadness still burned in her chest. <br></p><p>She was pulled from her \nnegative thoughts when she felt Bex reach out and pat her on the knee. \nWith a soft sigh, she cuddled closer to her mom and rested her head on \nher chest, needing to feel her arms around her. She could hear Bex\u2019s \nheart beating, and wondered if the baby was listening to it too, from \nthe inside. <br></p>",

She didn\u2019t even have to pretend to abstain from coffee \nanymore, because the smell of it alone turned her stomach. <br></p>[[MORE]]<p>On the day of \nher eleven week ultrasound, Bex had already finished two points of her \nmorning routine, and grabbed some clean clothes from the hall closet. \nShe retreated to the bathroom, the only place in the apartment where she\n had any real privacy, and started to get dressed. She pulled her shirt \nover her head and slipped on her favorite jeans. They were full of \nholes, naturally, which never ceased to confound her mother. Celia never\n could understand why anyone would pay money for clothes with holes in \nit (or ninety-percent of Bex\u2019s remaining wardrobe, for that matter). At \nthirty years old, Bex still got satisfaction out of wearing and doing \nthings her mother wouldn\u2019t approve of, the same as when she was an \nadolescent. Except now, she didn\u2019t have to sneak her <i>cool </i>clothes to school in her backpack, and change out of her \u2018mom-approved\u2019 clothes in the girl\u2019s room before homeroom.<br></p><p>She tugged her jeans up \nand tried to button them around her waist, but they had less give than \nusual. They were actually snug. She stood still, her heartbeat speeding \nup with excitement. Then, she rose on her tiptoes, trying to see her \nwaist in the small bathroom mirror. When she couldn\u2019t , she hurried to \nAndi\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cI need your mirror,\u201d she said breathlessly.<br></p><p>Andi was combing her \nhair in front of the large mirror over her dresser. She glanced at her \nmother in the doorway. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you wearing pants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold that thought.\u201d She\n lifted up her shirt and studied her abdomen from the front and the \nside. It wasn\u2019t her imagination. She was getting a baby bump. She sucked\n in her breath excitedly. It was small and hardly noticeable, but it was\n definitely there. She placed her hands on her stomach, unable to tear \nher eyes from the mirror.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Andi asked. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndi, I have a baby bump!\u201d she squealed. \u201cLook!\u201d</p><p>Andi looked down at her mother\u2019s stomach. \u201cI see it,\u201d she smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s so cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to show Bowie,\u201d she said, rushing out of the room, Andi following close behind.</p><p>Her husband was in the \nkitchen, making breakfast. \u201cBowie,\u201d she said. \u201cGuess what?\u201d She put her \nhands on his shoulders, barely able to contain her smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he asked. He looked her up and down. \u201cAnd where are your pants?\u201d</p><p>She ignored his last question. \u201cI\u2019m getting a baby bump,\u201d she grinned, raising her shirt to show him.</p><p>Bowie looked down at the\n small swell of her belly. \u201cAww,\u201d he gushed. \u201cThat\u2019s the cutest thing \nI\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d He placed both his hand on her stomach. \u201cI can\u2019t \nbelieve our baby\u2019s in there. It feels so unreal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wait until you see the sonogram today\u201d she told him. \u201cIt\u2019s the most amazing feeling in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait,\u201d he said, planting a kiss right in the middle of her forehead.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d said Andi, quietly. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, I\u2019m going shopping with Cece after school today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten,\u201d Bex told her. \u201cWhat are you guys shopping for? Do you want me to come with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Andi said too quickly. She slapped her hands over her mouth. \u201cYou can\u2019t come, and I can\u2019t tell you what we\u2019re buying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Bex nodded knowingly. \u201cSo it\u2019s a surprise for me?\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying anymore,\u201d Andi told her firmly, zipping her lips with an invisible zipper.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat <i>is </i>it?\u201d Bex\n cried, taking Andi in her arms and tickling her sides until her \ndaughter burst out in a fit of giggles. \u201cTell meeeee! You know I hate \nsuspense!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Andi gasped through her laughter. \u201cI\u2019ve already said too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Bex pretended to pout.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see soon enough,\u201d Andi promised, still laughing. \u201cNow I have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a good day!\u201d Bex called, as her daughter hurried out the door.</p><p>*****<br></p><p>Sonograms were still \nvery much like Bex remembered from her first pregnancy. The gel was \nstill cold, anyway. And it still felt weird when the ultrasound \ntechnician spread it on her belly. But she was a lot calmer this time \naround, and she wasn\u2019t alone. She had Bowie with her, sitting beside \nher, holding her hand. <br></p><p>\u201cBaby Quinn is looking \ngreat,\u201d the young technician said with a smile. \u201cEverything looks perfect.\u201d \nShe moved the paddle around Bex\u2019s stomach, trying to get the best view. \n\u201cTake a look at your baby.\u201d</p><p>Bex and Bowie studied \nthe fuzzy image on the screen. At her first sonogram, the fetus didn\u2019t \nlook like much, just a white splotch. But now, it was starting to \ndevelop features, and look like a tiny person. They could clearly make \nout the baby\u2019s shape. <br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so cool,\u201d Bowie \nbreathed. \u201cLook at that. That\u2019s our child.\u201d He stroked her palm with his\n thumb, unable to tear his eyes away from the screen. Bex was equally \nentranced. <br></p><p>\u201cIs this your first child?\u201d the technician asked them.</p><p>\u201cWe have a daughter,\u201d Bex told her.</p><p>\u201cAww. How old is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe just turned fourteen,\u201d Bex answered, still transfixed on the image of the baby inside her.</p><p>\u201cOh. Wow.\u201d The woman \nstudied them carefully, and Bex knew she was trying to figure out how \nold they were, even wondering if Bex had meant to say <i>four </i>instead of <i>fourteen</i>.\n She didn\u2019t bother explaining the situation. She was fully aware that \nshe and Bowie were the age when most couples would just be having their \nfirst child. She knew that being teen parents would always carry a \nstigma, or at least raise eyebrows, but she did her best to ignore it. \nTheir family was different than a lot of families in Shadyside, but \ntheir love for their little girl wasn\u2019t. <br></p><p>\u201cIs she excited to be a big sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s thrilled,\u201d Bowie said, beaming with pride. \u201cAnd I know she\u2019s going to be great at it. she\u2019s an amazing kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful,\u201d the woman said with a genuine smile. \u201cBoth mother and baby\u2019s heartbeats are strong. Would you like to hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d love to,\u201d Bex \nsaid. She squeezed Bowie\u2019s hand. She was so excited for him. She\u2019d been \nthrough this magical moment before, when she first heard Andi\u2019s \nheartbeat fourteen years ago, and the life growing inside her became \nreal. It was something she\u2019d never forgotten, and never would as long as\n she lived. It changed her forever. The moment she heard Andi\u2019s \nheartbeat, she instantly went from being a selfish kid, to loving \nsomeone selflessly. She couldn\u2019t wait for her husband to experience it \nfor himself. It was all new to him.</p><p>\u201cHere it is,\u201d the woman said. <br></p><p>Suddenly, the room \nfilled with what sounded like galloping horses, a harmony of Bex\u2019s \nslower heartbeat, and the baby\u2019s faster one. Even though it wasn\u2019t Bex\u2019s\n first time hearing her child\u2019s beating heart, her eyes filled with \ntears. They pooled over, running down her neck. \u00a0She turned to look at \nBowie. <br></p><p>Tears were streaming \ndown his face. Her heart swelled with love for her sweet, amazing \nhusband. She only wished Andi were there to experience it with them. \nTheir daughter was all that was missing from a perfect moment.</p><p>*****<br></p><p>Andi always felt at home\n in the craft store. It had the same feel as Andi Shack. She could \nliterally spend all day exploring the aisles and never get bored. She \nhad a spring in her step as she and Cece walked through the automatic \ndoors, and were met with her favorite store\u2019s familiar potpourri scent. \nAnd she was even more excited because before they left, Pops had slipped\n her a twenty dollar bill and told her to buy herself something. <br></p><p>\u201cDo you want to start with the yarn?\u201d Cece asked, always business first.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Andi nodded, \nlooking around, trying to take in everything around her. She was drawn \nto the bead section, and made a mental note to come back to it later.</p><p>They walked to the yarn \nsection. The aisle stretched out before Andi, every color and texture \nimaginable. \u201cHere\u2019s the baby yarn,\u201d Cece said. \u201cDo you see anything you \nlike?\u201d</p><p>Andi chewed her lip as \nshe looked over the skeins of yarn, all in soft pastel colors. \u201cThis,\u201d \nshe finally said, choosing a variegated yarn, a mixture of white and \nseveral shades of pale blue. The picture on the label showed a finished \nbaby blanket that reminded her of sea glass. When it was woven together,\n the pattern of the yarn worked out in uneven, patchy stripes. She \nimagined the blanket in the picture swaddling her new baby brother. \n\u201cIt\u2019s perfect!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t \nwant something more gender neutral?\u201d Cece asked skeptically. \u201cThis green\n is lovely.\u201d She touched a skein of minty green yarn.</p><p>\u201cNo, I like the blue,\u201d Andi insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect for a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you know it\u2019s going to be a boy?\u201d Cece asked. \u201cYour mother doesn\u2019t even know the baby\u2019s gender yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just know,\u201d Andi said. \u201cSister\u2019s instinct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, I just don\u2019t \nwant you to put all your eggs in one basket,\u201d Cece told her. \u201cI know \nyou\u2019re hoping the baby will be a boy, but it may not be. I really think \nyou\u2019d be better off choosing green or yellow, or even this multi-colored\n yarn here.\u201d She held up another variegated yarn in pastel rainbow hues.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Cece?\u201d Andi \npleaded, clasping her hands together. She was holding onto the hope that\n her sibling would be a boy, and she refused to let it go. In the back \nof her mind, she hoped buying \u201cboy\u201d yarn would sway the universe in her \nfavor.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Cece sighed. \u201cIf you\u2019re sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Andi said, giving her a hug. <br></p><p>Cece also picked out a \npair of knitting needles for Andi and a simple, beginner\u2019s pattern for a\n blanket. And before they checked out, Andi chose some new beads, and \nseveral rolls of duct tape. Their shopping trip was a success.</p><p>*****<br></p><p>When they got back to Pops and Cece\u2019s house, Andi and Cece went out back to Andi Shack. <br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll start the blanket for you,\u201d Cece offered. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get the hang of it quickly. You\u2019re so good at these things.\u201d</p><p>Andi watched closely as \nher grandmother put on her glasses and began to knit, and she listened \nas the older woman patiently explained what she was doing.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to try now?\u201d Cece asked her at last.</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d Andi said, tentatively, as her grandmother handed her the needles. <br></p><p>\u201cGive it a try. I\u2019m right here if you need any help.\u201d</p><p>Andi made a stitch, imitating what Cece had done.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Cece praised. <br></p><p>She frowned. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look as good as yours, though.\u201d She wanted every stitch to be perfect for such an important gift.<br></p><p>\u201cMake it a little looser,\u201d her grandmother corrected.</p><p>They worked side by \nside. Andi dropped more than a few stitches, but Cece helped her take \nthem out and fix them. It was cozy, just the two of them. And soon, they\n had finished almost two whole rows.</p><p>Andi jumped when there was a knock on the door of Andi Shack. <br></p><p>\u201cAndi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Bex!\u201d she gasped. \u201cDon\u2019t come in!\u201d she called. \u201cI\u2019ll be right out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d her mother answered.</p><p>Andi carefully tucked \nthe blanket and yarn away in a trunk and set her knitting needles on top\n of them. Then, she and Cece ducked under the doorway, into the \nbackyard. <br></p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d Bex smiled. \u201cWorking on my surprise? Can I have a hint?\u201d She elbowed Andi playfully in the side.<br></p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d Andi cried, giggling. \u201cI\u2019m not telling you what it is. So don\u2019t even try to get it out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of it,\u201d she winked. \u201cI\u2019m just teasing you.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Andi nodded. \u201cBecause what happens in Andi Shack <i>stays </i>in Andi Shack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndi Mack and the Crafting Shack of Secrets,\u201d Bex said dramatically.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Andi groaned at her mother\u2019s joke, laughing as Bex reached out to brush her hair back from her forehead.</p><p>\u201cHow did your appointment go today?\u201d Cece asked her daughter.</p><p>\u201cIt went great!\u201d Bex told her. \u201cThe baby is doing fine. And look!\u201d She turned so her mother could see her from the side.</p><p>\u201cHow adorable,\"Cece grinned. \"And look at you! You\u2019re glowing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have to get some maternity clothes soon,\u201d she said. \u201cI noticed my clothes are getting tight.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAre you having enough sex?\u201d Cece asked her, seriously.</p><p>\u201cMom! What the <i>heck?!\u201d </i>Bex cried, horrified. She felt herself blush, even though she was used to her mother\u2019s personal questions.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s healthy for the baby,\u201d Cece said matter-of-factly. \u201cIt\u2019s scientifically proven. Ask your doctor!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBowie and I are fine in that area,\u201d she assured her. \u201cNot that it\u2019s any of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019d better not be riding that two-wheeled death machine of yours,\u201d Cece went on, unfazed.</p><p>\u201cYou mean my motorcycle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Cece \nnodded. \u201cYou know how I feel about you riding that thing alone, Rebecca,\n but now you\u2019re carrying my grandchild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, mom,\u201d Bex \nsaid, softening. \u201cI won\u2019t ride it. I promise.\u201d She took the sonogram \npicture out of her pocket. \u201cLook at this, you guys.\u201d She held the print \nout to show her mother and daughter.</p><p>Cece put her glasses back on. \u201cAww,\u201d she gushed, studying the picture closely. \u201cIt\u2019s precious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the baby\u2019s head, and here\u2019s it\u2019s legs,\u201d Bex said to Andi, pointing out the fetus\u2019s shape in the grainy image.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Andi breathed. \u201cIt looks so small.\u201d</p><p>Bex nodded. \u201cAccording to the doctor, it\u2019s only about the size of a lime right now. Can you believe you were that small once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Andi shook her head. \u201cDo you know if it\u2019s a boy or a girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too soon to tell,\u201d her mother explained. \u201cNext time I go, we should be able to find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the baby has Bowie\u2019s cheeks,\u201d Cece offered.</p><p>Andi titled her head to the side, thoughtfully. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMark my words,\u201d Cece \nnodded. \u201cWe have a little Bowie on the way.\u201d She squeezed Andi\u2019s \nshoulder. \u201cAnd you look more and more like Bex every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThats a huge \ncompliment,\u201d Andi smiled, glancing at her mom. She wanted nothing more \nthan to grow up to be as fun, cool, and beautiful as her mother was.<br></p><p>Bex took Andi\u2019s hand in \nhers and squeezed it. \u201cWell, mini-me. You ready to go home? Your dad \nwants to have an indoor picnic tonight, and I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I,\u201d Andi said. <br></p><p>*****<br></p><p>When they got home, \nAndi, Bex, and Bowie spread their takeout dinner out on the living room \nfloor, and ate on piles of pillows, surrounded by the soft flicker of \nBowie\u2019s candle collection. Indoor picnics were a family tradition; they \nhad them at least twice a month. <br></p><p>While they ate their \nChinese food, Andi told her parents about Cyrus\u2019 latest installment of \nTater Theater, and Bowie told them about the eight-year-old he just \nstarted giving guitar lessons to at The Red Rooster. <br></p><p>\u201cCan we watch a movie?\u201d Andi asked, once they were finished cleaning up.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why not,\u201d Bex said. \u201cit\u2019s Friday night. Go get into your PJ\u2019s, and we\u2019ll pick something out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing scary,\u201d Andi reminded her, as she started toward her room. Her parents loved horror films, but she hated them.<br></p><p>\u201cYou mean you don\u2019t want to watch the sequel to <i>Shh!?\u201d </i>Bex asked with a mischievous wink.</p><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d Andi cried. \u201cThe first one scarred me for life, thank you very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Bowie said excitedly, turning to his wife. \u201cThey made a sequel to <i>Shh!?\u201d</i></p><p>Bex nodded. \u201cOh, yeah! This time, the psychotic librarian hunts down her victims from a traveling bookmobile. <i>She\u2019s evil on wheels\u2026\u201d</i> she added in a deep voice, imitating the narrator from the movie trailer.<br></p><p>\u201cHow did I not know that?\u201d he gasped. \u201cWe have to watch it sometime!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am <i>not </i>listening to you guys,\u201d Andi said, plugging her ears and hurrying into her room.</p><p>When she returned, her \nmom and dad were sitting on the couch, waiting for her. Bowie had made a\n bowl of popcorn, even though they\u2019d just eaten a huge meal. The candles\n were blown out, and the room was darkened. <br></p><p>She sat down between her\n parents, and snuggled under the blanket they were sharing. Thankfully, \nfor Andi\u2019s sake, they\u2019d chosen a reasonable PG13 movie to watch, with \nnothing too gory or violent. As the movie started, though, Andi found \nshe was having trouble getting into it. She tried, but her mind kept \nwandering elsewhere. <br></p><p>She glanced over at Bex,\n who was softly rubbing her baby bump, her eyes trained on the TV, and \ndoubt began to creep into her heart, even though she didn\u2019t want it to. \nAndi loved her mom and dad so much, and some of the happiest times she\u2019d\n ever had in her whole life were nights like these, when it was just the\n three of them together in the apartment, dancing, watching movies, \ncooking, eating\u2026 it didn\u2019t matter what they did, or how simple it was.\n They always had a great time. And she was struck with the realization \nthat in a few short months, things would never be the same. It would \nnever be just the three of them again. There would be a baby in the \nhouse, demanding Bex and Bowie\u2019s time, love, and attention. Life as she \nknew it was about to change once again.</p><p>She tried to squelch her\n bad feelings, and focus on the movie, but she couldn\u2019t. The TV screen \nblurred as her eyes filled with tears. Ashamed of herself, she tried to \nhold them back so her parents wouldn\u2019t see, but her eyes still stung, \nand her sadness still burned in her chest. <br></p><p>She was pulled from her \nnegative thoughts when she felt Bex reach out and pat her on the knee. \nWith a soft sigh, she cuddled closer to her mom and rested her head on \nher chest, needing to feel her arms around her. She could hear Bex\u2019s \nheart beating, and wondered if the baby was listening to it too, from \nthe inside. <br></p>",
                "content": "<p><br /><br /><br />By \nthe time Bex was eleven weeks pregnant, her mornings had taken on a \nroutine; wake up, puke, get dressed, try to eat breakfast, puke again, \ngo to work. She didn&rsquo;t even have to pretend to abstain from coffee \nanymore, because the smell of it alone turned her stomach. <br /></p><p>On the day of \nher eleven week ultrasound, Bex had already finished two points of her \nmorning routine, and grabbed some clean clothes from the hall closet. \nShe retreated to the bathroom, the only place in the apartment where she\n had any real privacy, and started to get dressed. She pulled her shirt \nover her head and slipped on her favorite jeans. They were full of \nholes, naturally, which never ceased to confound her mother. Celia never\n could understand why anyone would pay money for clothes with holes in \nit (or ninety-percent of Bex&rsquo;s remaining wardrobe, for that matter). At \nthirty years old, Bex still got satisfaction out of wearing and doing \nthings her mother wouldn&rsquo;t approve of, the same as when she was an \nadolescent. Except now, she didn&rsquo;t have to sneak her <i>cool </i>clothes to school in her backpack, and change out of her &lsquo;mom-approved&rsquo; clothes in the girl&rsquo;s room before homeroom.<br /></p><p>She tugged her jeans up \nand tried to button them around her waist, but they had less give than \nusual. They were actually snug. She stood still, her heartbeat speeding \nup with excitement. Then, she rose on her tiptoes, trying to see her \nwaist in the small bathroom mirror. When she couldn&rsquo;t , she hurried to \nAndi&rsquo;s room.</p><p>&ldquo;I need your mirror,&rdquo; she said breathlessly.<br /></p><p>Andi was combing her \nhair in front of the large mirror over her dresser. She glanced at her \nmother in the doorway. &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you wearing pants?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hold that thought.&rdquo; She\n lifted up her shirt and studied her abdomen from the front and the \nside. It wasn&rsquo;t her imagination. She was getting a baby bump. She sucked\n in her breath excitedly. It was small and hardly noticeable, but it was\n definitely there. She placed her hands on her stomach, unable to tear \nher eyes from the mirror.</p><p>&ldquo;Mom?&rdquo; Andi asked. &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Andi, I have a baby bump!&rdquo; she squealed. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;</p><p>Andi looked down at her mother&rsquo;s stomach. &ldquo;I see it,&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so cool.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have to show Bowie,&rdquo; she said, rushing out of the room, Andi following close behind.</p><p>Her husband was in the \nkitchen, making breakfast. &ldquo;Bowie,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Guess what?&rdquo; She put her \nhands on his shoulders, barely able to contain her smile.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; he asked. He looked her up and down. &ldquo;And where are your pants?&rdquo;</p><p>She ignored his last question. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting a baby bump,&rdquo; she grinned, raising her shirt to show him.</p><p>Bowie looked down at the\n small swell of her belly. &ldquo;Aww,&rdquo; he gushed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the cutest thing \nI&rsquo;ve ever seen.&rdquo; He placed both his hand on her stomach. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t \nbelieve our baby&rsquo;s in there. It feels so unreal.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just wait until you see the sonogram today&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the most amazing feeling in the world.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait,&rdquo; he said, planting a kiss right in the middle of her forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;Mom,&rdquo; said Andi, quietly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget, I&rsquo;m going shopping with Cece after school today.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t forgotten,&rdquo; Bex told her. &ldquo;What are you guys shopping for? Do you want me to come with you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Andi said too quickly. She slapped her hands over her mouth. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t come, and I can&rsquo;t tell you what we&rsquo;re buying.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Bex nodded knowingly. &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s a surprise for me?&rdquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying anymore,&rdquo; Andi told her firmly, zipping her lips with an invisible zipper.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What <i>is </i>it?&rdquo; Bex\n cried, taking Andi in her arms and tickling her sides until her \ndaughter burst out in a fit of giggles. &ldquo;Tell meeeee! You know I hate \nsuspense!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Andi gasped through her laughter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already said too much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; Bex pretended to pout.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see soon enough,&rdquo; Andi promised, still laughing. &ldquo;Now I have to go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have a good day!&rdquo; Bex called, as her daughter hurried out the door.</p><p>*****<br /></p><p>Sonograms were still \nvery much like Bex remembered from her first pregnancy. The gel was \nstill cold, anyway. And it still felt weird when the ultrasound \ntechnician spread it on her belly. But she was a lot calmer this time \naround, and she wasn&rsquo;t alone. She had Bowie with her, sitting beside \nher, holding her hand. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Baby Quinn is looking \ngreat,&rdquo; the young technician said with a smile. &ldquo;Everything looks perfect.&rdquo; \nShe moved the paddle around Bex&rsquo;s stomach, trying to get the best view. \n&ldquo;Take a look at your baby.&rdquo;</p><p>Bex and Bowie studied \nthe fuzzy image on the screen. At her first sonogram, the fetus didn&rsquo;t \nlook like much, just a white splotch. But now, it was starting to \ndevelop features, and look like a tiny person. They could clearly make \nout the baby&rsquo;s shape. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so cool,&rdquo; Bowie \nbreathed. &ldquo;Look at that. That&rsquo;s our child.&rdquo; He stroked her palm with his\n thumb, unable to tear his eyes away from the screen. Bex was equally \nentranced. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Is this your first child?&rdquo; the technician asked them.</p><p>&ldquo;We have a daughter,&rdquo; Bex told her.</p><p>&ldquo;Aww. How old is she?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She just turned fourteen,&rdquo; Bex answered, still transfixed on the image of the baby inside her.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh. Wow.&rdquo; The woman \nstudied them carefully, and Bex knew she was trying to figure out how \nold they were, even wondering if Bex had meant to say <i>four </i>instead of <i>fourteen</i>.\n She didn&rsquo;t bother explaining the situation. She was fully aware that \nshe and Bowie were the age when most couples would just be having their \nfirst child. She knew that being teen parents would always carry a \nstigma, or at least raise eyebrows, but she did her best to ignore it. \nTheir family was different than a lot of families in Shadyside, but \ntheir love for their little girl wasn&rsquo;t. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Is she excited to be a big sister?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s thrilled,&rdquo; Bowie said, beaming with pride. &ldquo;And I know she&rsquo;s going to be great at it. she&rsquo;s an amazing kid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s wonderful,&rdquo; the woman said with a genuine smile. &ldquo;Both mother and baby&rsquo;s heartbeats are strong. Would you like to hear?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d love to,&rdquo; Bex \nsaid. She squeezed Bowie&rsquo;s hand. She was so excited for him. She&rsquo;d been \nthrough this magical moment before, when she first heard Andi&rsquo;s \nheartbeat fourteen years ago, and the life growing inside her became \nreal. It was something she&rsquo;d never forgotten, and never would as long as\n she lived. It changed her forever. The moment she heard Andi&rsquo;s \nheartbeat, she instantly went from being a selfish kid, to loving \nsomeone selflessly. She couldn&rsquo;t wait for her husband to experience it \nfor himself. It was all new to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; the woman said. <br /></p><p>Suddenly, the room \nfilled with what sounded like galloping horses, a harmony of Bex&rsquo;s \nslower heartbeat, and the baby&rsquo;s faster one. Even though it wasn&rsquo;t Bex&rsquo;s\n first time hearing her child&rsquo;s beating heart, her eyes filled with \ntears. They pooled over, running down her neck. &nbsp;She turned to look at \nBowie. <br /></p><p>Tears were streaming \ndown his face. Her heart swelled with love for her sweet, amazing \nhusband. She only wished Andi were there to experience it with them. \nTheir daughter was all that was missing from a perfect moment.</p><p>*****<br /></p><p>Andi always felt at home\n in the craft store. It had the same feel as Andi Shack. She could \nliterally spend all day exploring the aisles and never get bored. She \nhad a spring in her step as she and Cece walked through the automatic \ndoors, and were met with her favorite store&rsquo;s familiar potpourri scent. \nAnd she was even more excited because before they left, Pops had slipped\n her a twenty dollar bill and told her to buy herself something. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to start with the yarn?&rdquo; Cece asked, always business first.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Andi nodded, \nlooking around, trying to take in everything around her. She was drawn \nto the bead section, and made a mental note to come back to it later.</p><p>They walked to the yarn \nsection. The aisle stretched out before Andi, every color and texture \nimaginable. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the baby yarn,&rdquo; Cece said. &ldquo;Do you see anything you \nlike?&rdquo;</p><p>Andi chewed her lip as \nshe looked over the skeins of yarn, all in soft pastel colors. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; \nshe finally said, choosing a variegated yarn, a mixture of white and \nseveral shades of pale blue. The picture on the label showed a finished \nbaby blanket that reminded her of sea glass. When it was woven together,\n the pattern of the yarn worked out in uneven, patchy stripes. She \nimagined the blanket in the picture swaddling her new baby brother. \n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfect!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure you don&rsquo;t \nwant something more gender neutral?&rdquo; Cece asked skeptically. &ldquo;This green\n is lovely.&rdquo; She touched a skein of minty green yarn.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I like the blue,&rdquo; Andi insisted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfect for a boy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And how do you know it&rsquo;s going to be a boy?&rdquo; Cece asked. &ldquo;Your mother doesn&rsquo;t even know the baby&rsquo;s gender yet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I just know,&rdquo; Andi said. &ldquo;Sister&rsquo;s instinct.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Honey, I just don&rsquo;t \nwant you to put all your eggs in one basket,&rdquo; Cece told her. &ldquo;I know \nyou&rsquo;re hoping the baby will be a boy, but it may not be. I really think \nyou&rsquo;d be better off choosing green or yellow, or even this multi-colored\n yarn here.&rdquo; She held up another variegated yarn in pastel rainbow hues.</p><p>&ldquo;Please, Cece?&rdquo; Andi \npleaded, clasping her hands together. She was holding onto the hope that\n her sibling would be a boy, and she refused to let it go. In the back \nof her mind, she hoped buying &ldquo;boy&rdquo; yarn would sway the universe in her \nfavor.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Cece sighed. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re sure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Andi said, giving her a hug. <br /></p><p>Cece also picked out a \npair of knitting needles for Andi and a simple, beginner&rsquo;s pattern for a\n blanket. And before they checked out, Andi chose some new beads, and \nseveral rolls of duct tape. Their shopping trip was a success.</p><p>*****<br /></p><p>When they got back to Pops and Cece&rsquo;s house, Andi and Cece went out back to Andi Shack. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll start the blanket for you,&rdquo; Cece offered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll get the hang of it quickly. You&rsquo;re so good at these things.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi watched closely as \nher grandmother put on her glasses and began to knit, and she listened \nas the older woman patiently explained what she was doing.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you ready to try now?&rdquo; Cece asked her at last.</p><p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; Andi said, tentatively, as her grandmother handed her the needles. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Give it a try. I&rsquo;m right here if you need any help.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi made a stitch, imitating what Cece had done.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Cece praised. <br /></p><p>She frowned. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look as good as yours, though.&rdquo; She wanted every stitch to be perfect for such an important gift.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Make it a little looser,&rdquo; her grandmother corrected.</p><p>They worked side by \nside. Andi dropped more than a few stitches, but Cece helped her take \nthem out and fix them. It was cozy, just the two of them. And soon, they\n had finished almost two whole rows.</p><p>Andi jumped when there was a knock on the door of Andi Shack. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Andi?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Bex!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come in!&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right out!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; her mother answered.</p><p>Andi carefully tucked \nthe blanket and yarn away in a trunk and set her knitting needles on top\n of them. Then, she and Cece ducked under the doorway, into the \nbackyard. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;There you are,&rdquo; Bex smiled. &ldquo;Working on my surprise? Can I have a hint?&rdquo; She elbowed Andi playfully in the side.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Mom!&rdquo; Andi cried, giggling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not telling you what it is. So don&rsquo;t even try to get it out of me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t dream of it,&rdquo; she winked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just teasing you.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Andi nodded. &ldquo;Because what happens in Andi Shack <i>stays </i>in Andi Shack.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Andi Mack and the Crafting Shack of Secrets,&rdquo; Bex said dramatically.</p><p>&ldquo;Mom,&rdquo; Andi groaned at her mother&rsquo;s joke, laughing as Bex reached out to brush her hair back from her forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;How did your appointment go today?&rdquo; Cece asked her daughter.</p><p>&ldquo;It went great!&rdquo; Bex told her. &ldquo;The baby is doing fine. And look!&rdquo; She turned so her mother could see her from the side.</p><p>&ldquo;How adorable,\"Cece grinned. \"And look at you! You&rsquo;re glowing!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have to get some maternity clothes soon,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I noticed my clothes are getting tight.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Are you having enough sex?&rdquo; Cece asked her, seriously.</p><p>&ldquo;Mom! What the <i>heck?!&rdquo; </i>Bex cried, horrified. She felt herself blush, even though she was used to her mother&rsquo;s personal questions.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s healthy for the baby,&rdquo; Cece said matter-of-factly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s scientifically proven. Ask your doctor!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bowie and I are fine in that area,&rdquo; she assured her. &ldquo;Not that it&rsquo;s any of your business.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;d better not be riding that two-wheeled death machine of yours,&rdquo; Cece went on, unfazed.</p><p>&ldquo;You mean my motorcycle?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Cece \nnodded. &ldquo;You know how I feel about you riding that thing alone, Rebecca,\n but now you&rsquo;re carrying my grandchild.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, mom,&rdquo; Bex \nsaid, softening. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t ride it. I promise.&rdquo; She took the sonogram \npicture out of her pocket. &ldquo;Look at this, you guys.&rdquo; She held the print \nout to show her mother and daughter.</p><p>Cece put her glasses back on. &ldquo;Aww,&rdquo; she gushed, studying the picture closely. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s precious.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the baby&rsquo;s head, and here&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s legs,&rdquo; Bex said to Andi, pointing out the fetus&rsquo;s shape in the grainy image.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; Andi breathed. &ldquo;It looks so small.&rdquo;</p><p>Bex nodded. &ldquo;According to the doctor, it&rsquo;s only about the size of a lime right now. Can you believe you were that small once?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Andi shook her head. &ldquo;Do you know if it&rsquo;s a boy or a girl?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too soon to tell,&rdquo; her mother explained. &ldquo;Next time I go, we should be able to find out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think the baby has Bowie&rsquo;s cheeks,&rdquo; Cece offered.</p><p>Andi titled her head to the side, thoughtfully. &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mark my words,&rdquo; Cece \nnodded. &ldquo;We have a little Bowie on the way.&rdquo; She squeezed Andi&rsquo;s \nshoulder. &ldquo;And you look more and more like Bex every day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thats a huge \ncompliment,&rdquo; Andi smiled, glancing at her mom. She wanted nothing more \nthan to grow up to be as fun, cool, and beautiful as her mother was.<br /></p><p>Bex took Andi&rsquo;s hand in \nhers and squeezed it. &ldquo;Well, mini-me. You ready to go home? Your dad \nwants to have an indoor picnic tonight, and I&rsquo;m starving.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; Andi said. <br /></p><p>*****<br /></p><p>When they got home, \nAndi, Bex, and Bowie spread their takeout dinner out on the living room \nfloor, and ate on piles of pillows, surrounded by the soft flicker of \nBowie&rsquo;s candle collection. Indoor picnics were a family tradition; they \nhad them at least twice a month. <br /></p><p>While they ate their \nChinese food, Andi told her parents about Cyrus&rsquo; latest installment of \nTater Theater, and Bowie told them about the eight-year-old he just \nstarted giving guitar lessons to at The Red Rooster. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Can we watch a movie?&rdquo; Andi asked, once they were finished cleaning up.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why not,&rdquo; Bex said. &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Friday night. Go get into your PJ&rsquo;s, and we&rsquo;ll pick something out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing scary,&rdquo; Andi reminded her, as she started toward her room. Her parents loved horror films, but she hated them.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You mean you don&rsquo;t want to watch the sequel to <i>Shh!?&rdquo; </i>Bex asked with a mischievous wink.</p><p>&ldquo;No way!&rdquo; Andi cried. &ldquo;The first one scarred me for life, thank you very much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Bowie said excitedly, turning to his wife. &ldquo;They made a sequel to <i>Shh!?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Bex nodded. &ldquo;Oh, yeah! This time, the psychotic librarian hunts down her victims from a traveling bookmobile. <i>She&rsquo;s evil on wheels&hellip;&rdquo;</i> she added in a deep voice, imitating the narrator from the movie trailer.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;How did I not know that?&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;We have to watch it sometime!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am <i>not </i>listening to you guys,&rdquo; Andi said, plugging her ears and hurrying into her room.</p><p>When she returned, her \nmom and dad were sitting on the couch, waiting for her. Bowie had made a\n bowl of popcorn, even though they&rsquo;d just eaten a huge meal. The candles\n were blown out, and the room was darkened. <br /></p><p>She sat down between her\n parents, and snuggled under the blanket they were sharing. Thankfully, \nfor Andi&rsquo;s sake, they&rsquo;d chosen a reasonable PG13 movie to watch, with \nnothing too gory or violent. As the movie started, though, Andi found \nshe was having trouble getting into it. She tried, but her mind kept \nwandering elsewhere. <br /></p><p>She glanced over at Bex,\n who was softly rubbing her baby bump, her eyes trained on the TV, and \ndoubt began to creep into her heart, even though she didn&rsquo;t want it to. \nAndi loved her mom and dad so much, and some of the happiest times she&rsquo;d\n ever had in her whole life were nights like these, when it was just the\n three of them together in the apartment, dancing, watching movies, \ncooking, eating&hellip; it didn&rsquo;t matter what they did, or how simple it was.\n They always had a great time. And she was struck with the realization \nthat in a few short months, things would never be the same. It would \nnever be just the three of them again. There would be a baby in the \nhouse, demanding Bex and Bowie&rsquo;s time, love, and attention. Life as she \nknew it was about to change once again.</p><p>She tried to squelch her\n bad feelings, and focus on the movie, but she couldn&rsquo;t. The TV screen \nblurred as her eyes filled with tears. Ashamed of herself, she tried to \nhold them back so her parents wouldn&rsquo;t see, but her eyes still stung, \nand her sadness still burned in her chest. <br /></p><p>She was pulled from her \nnegative thoughts when she felt Bex reach out and pat her on the knee. \nWith a soft sigh, she cuddled closer to her mom and rested her head on \nher chest, needing to feel her arms around her. She could hear Bex&rsquo;s \nheart beating, and wondered if the baby was listening to it too, from \nthe inside. <br /></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p><br /><br /><br />By \nthe time Bex was eleven weeks pregnant, her mornings had taken on a \nroutine; wake up, puke, get dressed, try to eat breakfast, puke again, \ngo to work. She didn&rsquo;t even have to pretend to abstain from coffee \nanymore, because the smell of it alone turned her stomach. <br /></p>",
