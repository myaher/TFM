It was as though you couldn\u2019t bear to go back inside the bar, as if that would be drawing a line under the time you\u2019d spent together, officially bringing it to a close. Kind of like the in-person equivalent of \u201cyou hang up first\u201d.</p><p>As the cab finally turned out of sight, you stared at the empty road it had previously occupied and envisioned a car bringing Taehyung back to you the same way later that day, hugging your arms around yourself and allowing a smile to take over your face as you thought about the past few hours and speculated what future hours together may involve.</p><p>Finally turning to push open the bar door, you could see Ronnie examining an imaginary smudge on the window with a level of faux-concentration so intense that it made it glaringly obvious he had been keeping watch on the two of you as you said your goodbyes.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cEverything okay there?\u201d You pushed the door closed behind you and hopped on the stool facing the one Ronnie perched atop. You sighed dramatically in response to his heavily loaded question and rested your chin in your upturned palm, grinning widely at him. \u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes then, should I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just honestly didn\u2019t believe that people like that existed.\u201d You knew that if you could see your own behaviour you\u2019d most likely be sticking your fingers down your throat and making pretend gagging noises. As it was however you simply sighed again and touched your fingers to your lips, as though to seal Taehyung\u2019s touch to them, only partially noticing Ronnie&rsquo;s offended facial expression.</p><p>\u201cHow can you say such a thing,\u201d he raised his hand to his chest and pressed just his fingertips to it, the very image of affronted \u201cwhen you know\u00a0<i>I</i>\u00a0exist?\u201d</p><p>You leant forward and tapped the top of his hand fondly. \u201cOf course Ronnie, that\u2019s precisely why: you\u2019ve given me such unrealistic expectations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstandable.\u201d He seemed content with your answer and shifted in his seat, his face serious again, eyeing you questioningly with unspoken worry lining his face. \u201cSo&hellip;is this guy going to be around for a while?\u201d</p><p>You sat back in your seat, turning your gaze to stare out of the window, the smile on your face becoming wistful. \u201cNo,\u201d you began, and in your periphery you could see his shoulders relax. \u201cHe has to go home in a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where is that?\u201d You noticed for the first time that he was drinking coffee rather than beer as he lifted his mug to his lips and peered at you over the rim.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really sure.\u201d You answered honestly and forcibly bright, reluctant to admit to yourself the gravity of the truth in your reply. Of course you had managed to work out what country he was from and the language he spoke, but that didn\u2019t necessarily mean that was where he was travelling back to.</p><p>Ronnie had been a positive force in your life for as long as you could remember. You knew this inquisition was coming from a place of love and a desire to protect you after you had been failed so often in the past, however you could feel yourself becoming tense as he struggled to keep the relief from his expression at your answers to his questions.</p><p>He placed the mug back on the high table and rested his hands flat on the surface either side of it. It was obvious he was trying to formulate a sentence, one that you were unlikely to want to hear, as he inhaled deeply before opening his mouth. \u201cHow much do you really know about him, y/n?\u201d</p><p>You huffed and rose from your stool to pour yourself a coffee from the pot Ronnie had left on the end of the bar by the phone. Your eyes lingered on the handset in the cradle as the dark liquid filled the cup and remained there as you brought the drink to your lips, wondering how the last couple of days would have gone had you not used it to locate your own phone. Your musings were broken as the bitter drink hit your tongue, and it suddenly became apparent why Ronnie usually opted for beer. \u201cYou are not good at making coffee,\u201d you informed him as you tipped the contents of your cup and remnants of the pot down the sink at the back of the bar and set about brewing a fresh batch.</p><p>Ronnie followed your movement away from the window and handed over his own mug, silently acquiescing to the poor quality of the drink, still keeping his eyes on your face through the mirror behind the bottles lined up on display. The only sound in the room was the gentle clinking of the crockery as you poured out two mugs, pushing one across the bar\u2019s surface towards Ronnie, still avoiding his question.</p><p>He sipped the drink and made a light smacking noise with his mouth in appreciation for the improved taste. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to see you get hurt again, y/n,\u201d he tried to explain. \u201cI saw you with that idiot for four years and it literally ended the day before yesterday. And this&hellip;this boy appears out nowhere and \u2013 well, you would have to be blind to not be able to see how taken you are with him.\u201d</p><p>You could feel your heart sink a little at his words, but hearing the genuine concern in his voice reminded you of how important his opinion was to you, and that he had always had your best interests at heart. \u201cDo you think I\u2019ve read more in to this than there really is?\u201d</p><p>You saw his eyebrows draw together as he shook his head emphatically. \u201cNo, not at all, I \u2013 God, Hannah is so much better than me at this stuff.\u201d He rubbed his hand over the back of his head, clearly frustrated at his lack of eloquence. He took a deep breath and waited for you to meet his eyes. \u201cHe looks at you the way I imagine I looked at Maggie.\u201d</p><p>You softened at the mention of Hannah\u2019s mother\u2019s name. He rarely mentioned her, and the slightly pained look which crossed his face was confirmation of the weight of his words. You stepped around the bar to wrap your arms around him, ashamed that your actions had somehow caused him distress at the memory of her. \u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry Ronnie.\u201d</p><p>He returned your hug briefly before clearing his throat and checking himself for his minor display of vulnerability, patting you on the back in both reassurance and as an indication that the moment had mostly passed. \u201cListen, I think whatever is going on between you two is more than just a bit of a fling. Really, I do. But you\u2019re not stupid y/n, you know as well as I do that sometimes things just can\u2019t happen, no matter how well-intentioned the people involved start off. I can\u2019t see you be let down again, okay?\u201d</p><p>You understood perfectly why he was worried, you had already told yourself the same things dozens of times since you met Taehyung. You knew that if you tried to explain the sheer intensity of your feelings for him you would only cause Ronnie more concern. Instead, you decided to attempt to express how good you had felt about yourself in the last couple of days, despite everything that happened with Mark and all the upset there. You tried to explain how easily you could make each other smile and laugh without even really speaking the same language, and how \u2013 given the amount of lies you\u2019d been subjected to throughout your life \u2013 being able to speak the same language may not always be as much of a benefit as it was perceived to be. \u201cAnd honestly Ronnie,\u201d you began to feel the butterflies flutter around in your stomach as you spoke about Taehyung, and you felt the smile on your face grow wider and wider with each word. \u201cHe just makes me feel totally, ridiculously and unbelievably happy.\u201d</p><p>He seemed at least partially satisfied with that, apparently convinced by the blatantly ecstatic look on your face as you spoke about your new-found romance. He held his hands up in mock-defeat. \u201cAlright, alright, I\u2019ll lay off. For now. But if he does anything to hurt you \u2013 \u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d you cut him off and mimed a throttling action with both your hands, before kissing him on the cheek and heading back to your room to prepare for your visit to Mark&rsquo;s, confident that not even your ex could ruin this feeling for you.</p><p>\u00a0~~~</p><p>Taehyung stood motionless in the doorway, his heartbeat pounding in his ears as he could feel the blood drain from his face. He clenched his fists at his side and shifted his gaze between Sang-hun and Seong-min, the eyes of the latter of the two trained somewhere above the top of Taehyung\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201c<b>What do you mean, home? We haven\u2019t finished the shoot yet. There\u2019s two more days scheduled. That\u2019s right isn\u2019t it hyung?</b>\u201d He directed his questions to Namjoon, desperately seeking reassurance from their leader.</p><p>Namjoon stood and moved next to his dongsaeng and placed a hand on his shoulder, smiling sympathetically as he did so. \u201c<b>They said they can finish it in post, Taehyung-ah. They already changed the flights.</b>\u201d He squoze his hand around the top of Taehyung\u2019s arm in an attempt to comfort and placate him.</p><p>Taehyung whipped his head round to Seong-min. \u201c<b>Why are you doing this?</b>\u201d He tried and failed to blink away the petulant tears he could feel beginning to well up in his eyes.</p><p>In the corner of his field of vision he saw Jimin rise from his seat and start to make his way over. Seong-min held up a hand to halt his movements and spoke for the first time since his return. \u201c<b>Come and speak with me.</b>\u201d He was evidently surprised by the vitriol present on the young man\u2019s face as he walked towards the door to the bedroom and opened it, gesturing for Taehyung to enter. \u201c<b>Please, Taehyung-ssi.</b>\u201d</p><p>Before deciding to comply with his manager\u2019s request he looked over to Jimin, who remained motionless stood in front of his seat, who nodded with a pleading look in his eye as a way to urge him to follow Seong-min.</p><p>Sighing deeply, he walked towards the other room, sensing all the member\u2019s eyes on him as he passed. He began to feel guilty at any trouble he had caused for his brothers through his rash decisions over the past few days. This fear was rapidly assuaged however when he felt a soft pat on the back of his leg, and he was surprised to find Yoongi smiling up at him warmly in a clear attempt at consolation; and as he vaguely heard a low \u201c<b>hyung, fighting!</b>\u201d somewhere from Jungkook&rsquo;s direction.</p><p>Taehyung perched on the end of the king-size bed as Seong-min closed the door. His eyes followed the manager as he leant his weight on the dresser that was facing him. The older man looked down to his shoes for a moment as he began to try and explain. \u201c<b>I didn\u2019t want for it to happen like this. I need you to understand that, okay?</b>\u201d Taehyung didn\u2019t respond and simply stared at the strangely patterned rug beneath Seong-min\u2019s feet. \u201c<b>When I found that girl in here, I thought we\u2019d had a security breach. I thought someone had broken in to your room and that your safety was at risk. By the time Jimin explained some of what happened everyone was already on alert. I tried to play it down as a misunderstanding after the&hellip;erm&hellip;footage from the CCTV but there wasn\u2019t a great deal I was able to do about it, the company had already started putting things in place to wind the visit up.</b>\u201d</p><p>Taehyung considered the amount of stress he must have put everyone, particularly Seong-min, under by allowing you to sleep in his room and the events that followed as a result of that decision. He was more than aware that \u2013 in retrospect \u2013 he obviously had not been thinking clearly in your presence, so taken was he with the fantasy of normality with you by his side. He chewed on his lips and raised his eyes contritely. \u201c<b>Hyung, I\u2019m \u2013</b>\u201d</p><p>But Seong-min wasn\u2019t finished, and his expression was as determined as it was regretful. \u201c<b>I need you to give me your phone, Taehyung-ssi.</b>\u201d</p><p>He placed his hand over the pocket where the device rested reflexively and sat with his mouth agape, blinking dumbly at the manager\u2019s outstretched palm. This couldn\u2019t be happening, could it? The thought of having to leave without saying goodbye was hard enough, but at least he could have called you to offer some semblance of an explanation once they had arrived home and he had some privacy. \u201c<b>Hyung&hellip;</b>\u201d he trailed off quietly and felt frustration burn behind his eyes.</p><p>Seong-min\u2019s voice lowered to match the softness of Taehyung\u2019s, and he stepped forward to crouch in front of him. \u201c<b>I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s not my decision. You\u2019ll be given a replacement when we get home but I have to take your phone right now.</b>\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t understand how it had gotten to this point. He knew he had acted impulsively since they got here, but they had all done that at some point, they were human after all. Was it really just because you had slept in his room? He tried to remember if that had ever been explicitly forbidden in any of the multitude of agreements he\u2019d had to sign over the years.</p><p>As though reading his thoughts, Seong-min spoke again, walking towards the window and pretended to be taking in the view. \u201c<b>After you disappeared last night, everyone was trying to get a hold of you. You vanished alone in a strange country and no one could reach you. The company has decided that allowing you to maintain contact with this girl is too&hellip;problematic.</b>\u201d</p><p>\u201c<b>Y/n.</b>\u201d Taehyung muttered under his breath as he felt a combination of rage and impotence at this turn of events.</p><p>\u201c<b>What?</b>\u201d He was clearly devastated to see his charge so obviously in distress, and even through his anger Taehyung could tell the words the manager spoke were not truly his own.</p><p>He walked towards the window to stand beside the man and touched his arm to encourage him to look his way. \u201c<b>Her name is y/n, and she hasn\u2019t done anything wrong. She doesn\u2019t even know who we are, who I am.</b>\u201d He swallowed thickly and licked his dry lips, and he felt his voice crack under the strain of his words. \u201c<b>I\u2019ll give you my phone, okay. I\u2019ll go home and I\u2019ll do everything I\u2019m told to. But&hellip;please, hyung, don\u2019t make me leave without saying goodbye to her.</b>\u201d</p><p>\u00a0~~~</p><p>Something Taehyung said must have struck a chord with his manager, or maybe he had decided this would be the best way to get them all back to Korea with as little resistance as possible, either way his plea was heeded. This was how he found himself \u2013 not two hours after he had left you \u2013 speeding back towards the bar, this time with Seong-min in tow rather than Jimin, as the rest of the members and staff made for the airport.</p><p>His head throbbed and his pulse raced, his heart in his throat. He could see Seong-min glance over at him occasionally, worry etching his face, and as angry as he was he knew he could only really hold himself responsible for this eventuality. His mind alternated between replaying the time you had spent together and presenting him with alternative outcomes based on a variety of different actions he could have taken throughout that time.</p><p>When the driver pulled up to the front of the bar, it occurred to him that he didn\u2019t have any idea what he was going to say to you. How on earth could he explain his sudden departure, and for it to make sense, without telling you absolutely everything? Seong-min had told him in no uncertain terms that he had two minutes and not a moment longer, when two hours wouldn\u2019t be enough to explain the whole situation.</p><p>He swung his long legs out of the car and quickly strode to the front door, not wanting to waste one second of his brief opportunity to say goodbye and to tell you how wonderful it had been to spend time with you. He squinted through the glass and saw movement behind the bar. He rapped lightly on the door and waved at the figure on the inside, who he immediately established to be Ronnie as he approached the entrance.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d he asked breathlessly as he stared up at the large man opening the door.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not here.\u201d He simply informed him, before elaborating in response to Taehyung\u2019s blank expression. \u201cShe\u2019s gone to get her things. Her clothes and&hellip;her other things. From Mark\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>At the mention of Mark\u2019s name he understood and he sighed at the poor timing. He nodded rapidly, his eyes darting back and forth as he attempted to formulate a solution. His eyes fell on the phone resting on the corner of the bar and his face lit up. \u201cI can call her?\u201d he asked carefully, walking over to the handset and pointing to it.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly is going on?\u201d Ronnie saw Taehyung\u2019s line of sight shift to the man leaning on the car parked outside the building looking at his watch, and he felt a twinge of compassion towards the panic-stricken young man, despite not having a clue what was happening. He waved his hand in agreement. \u201cFine, fine. Go ahead.\u201d</p><p>A grateful yet strained smile spread across his fine features and he lifted the handset from the cradle and held it mutely for a moment before realising he didn\u2019t know your number, and he held the phone out towards the puzzled looking older man who was switching between watching Taehyung and Seong-min outside as though spectating a tennis match. \u201cPlease will you&hellip;her number?\u201d</p><p>As confused as he was, to his credit Ronnie stepped forward without asking anything further and punched your number into the keypad. There seemed to be an odd anticipation also present on his face as he watched the younger man lift the phone to his ear, his foot tapping restlessly.</p><p>The phone rang and rang and each time Taehyung heard the sound he felt his heart sink a little bit further, and as your voicemail message clicked on Seong-min approached the large window and lifted his left arm to display his watch through the pane of glass.</p><p>Taehyung exhaled loudly as he hung up, before beginning to turn on the spot to look around the room for inspiration. He turned to Ronnie who still stood dumbly in the middle of the room, looking utterly bemused by the strange young man spinning around behind his bar. \u201cDo you have a pen?\u201d he asked frantically as his eyes landed on a pile of napkins, immensely thankful that &lsquo;pen&rsquo; was one of the words that didn\u2019t require any translation.</p><p>Ronnie reached in to the pocket of the apron he wore tied around his waist and produced a pencil, handing it over to Taehyung and watching as he leant over the napkins, the pencil motionless in his hand as he frowned and tried to work out what to write.</p><p>A persistent tapping began from outside and a frustrated groan left Taehyung\u2019s lips. So far he had only managed to write your name, having already practiced the letters and spelling when he left you the note back at the hotel.</p><p>Further than that however, his mind refused to cooperate, and \u2013 not for the first time \u2013 he wished he had paid more attention in the numerous English lessons he had been subjected to. He reached behind his head and unhooked the necklace that rested there most days and slid one of the pendants from it, securing the chain back around his neck once he had done so. He took hold of the pencil again to complete the note, before pressing the red tiger pendant in to the paper and folding it securely inside before handing it to Ronnie, his eyes wet with unshed tears.</p><p>He had wanted desperately to tell you much he regretted leaving you. He wanted you to know just how insanely grateful he was that you had pressed the wrong button in that lift. How he wished he could stay here with you and make you understand just how much your time together had meant. Lastly and most importantly, how - no matter what might happen - all he wanted was for you be happy, even if it isn\u2019t because of him.</p><p>But there was simply not enough time and he lacked the necessary knowledge to articulate everything he wanted to say. Instead, he had written two words and one letter:</p><p>\u201c<i>I\u2019m sorry. V.</i>\u201d</p><p><b><i>A/N Chapter 14 to be posted next Friday!!</i></b></p>",

You sighed dramatically in response to his heavily loaded question and rested your chin in your upturned palm, grinning widely at him. \u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes then, should I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just honestly didn\u2019t believe that people like that existed.\u201d You knew that if you could see your own behaviour you\u2019d most likely be sticking your fingers down your throat and making pretend gagging noises. As it was however you simply sighed again and touched your fingers to your lips, as though to seal Taehyung\u2019s touch to them, only partially noticing Ronnie\u2019s offended facial expression.</p><p>\u201cHow can you say such a thing,\u201d he raised his hand to his chest and pressed just his fingertips to it, the very image of affronted \u201cwhen you know\u00a0<i>I</i>\u00a0exist?\u201d</p><p>You leant forward and tapped the top of his hand fondly. \u201cOf course Ronnie, that\u2019s precisely why: you\u2019ve given me such unrealistic expectations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstandable.\u201d He seemed content with your answer and shifted in his seat, his face serious again, eyeing you questioningly with unspoken worry lining his face. \u201cSo\u2026is this guy going to be around for a while?\u201d</p><p>You sat back in your seat, turning your gaze to stare out of the window, the smile on your face becoming wistful. \u201cNo,\u201d you began, and in your periphery you could see his shoulders relax. \u201cHe has to go home in a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where is that?\u201d You noticed for the first time that he was drinking coffee rather than beer as he lifted his mug to his lips and peered at you over the rim.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really sure.\u201d You answered honestly and forcibly bright, reluctant to admit to yourself the gravity of the truth in your reply. Of course you had managed to work out what country he was from and the language he spoke, but that didn\u2019t necessarily mean that was where he was travelling back to.</p><p>Ronnie had been a positive force in your life for as long as you could remember. You knew this inquisition was coming from a place of love and a desire to protect you after you had been failed so often in the past, however you could feel yourself becoming tense as he struggled to keep the relief from his expression at your answers to his questions.</p><p>He placed the mug back on the high table and rested his hands flat on the surface either side of it. It was obvious he was trying to formulate a sentence, one that you were unlikely to want to hear, as he inhaled deeply before opening his mouth. \u201cHow much do you really know about him, y/n?\u201d</p><p>You huffed and rose from your stool to pour yourself a coffee from the pot Ronnie had left on the end of the bar by the phone. Your eyes lingered on the handset in the cradle as the dark liquid filled the cup and remained there as you brought the drink to your lips, wondering how the last couple of days would have gone had you not used it to locate your own phone. Your musings were broken as the bitter drink hit your tongue, and it suddenly became apparent why Ronnie usually opted for beer. \u201cYou are not good at making coffee,\u201d you informed him as you tipped the contents of your cup and remnants of the pot down the sink at the back of the bar and set about brewing a fresh batch.</p><p>Ronnie followed your movement away from the window and handed over his own mug, silently acquiescing to the poor quality of the drink, still keeping his eyes on your face through the mirror behind the bottles lined up on display. The only sound in the room was the gentle clinking of the crockery as you poured out two mugs, pushing one across the bar\u2019s surface towards Ronnie, still avoiding his question.</p><p>He sipped the drink and made a light smacking noise with his mouth in appreciation for the improved taste. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to see you get hurt again, y/n,\u201d he tried to explain. \u201cI saw you with that idiot for four years and it literally ended the day before yesterday. And this\u2026this boy appears out nowhere and \u2013 well, you would have to be blind to not be able to see how taken you are with him.\u201d</p><p>You could feel your heart sink a little at his words, but hearing the genuine concern in his voice reminded you of how important his opinion was to you, and that he had always had your best interests at heart. \u201cDo you think I\u2019ve read more in to this than there really is?\u201d</p><p>You saw his eyebrows draw together as he shook his head emphatically. \u201cNo, not at all, I \u2013 God, Hannah is so much better than me at this stuff.\u201d He rubbed his hand over the back of his head, clearly frustrated at his lack of eloquence. He took a deep breath and waited for you to meet his eyes. \u201cHe looks at you the way I imagine I looked at Maggie.\u201d</p><p>You softened at the mention of Hannah\u2019s mother\u2019s name. He rarely mentioned her, and the slightly pained look which crossed his face was confirmation of the weight of his words. You stepped around the bar to wrap your arms around him, ashamed that your actions had somehow caused him distress at the memory of her. \u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry Ronnie.\u201d</p><p>He returned your hug briefly before clearing his throat and checking himself for his minor display of vulnerability, patting you on the back in both reassurance and as an indication that the moment had mostly passed. \u201cListen, I think whatever is going on between you two is more than just a bit of a fling. Really, I do. But you\u2019re not stupid y/n, you know as well as I do that sometimes things just can\u2019t happen, no matter how well-intentioned the people involved start off. I can\u2019t see you be let down again, okay?\u201d</p><p>You understood perfectly why he was worried, you had already told yourself the same things dozens of times since you met Taehyung. You knew that if you tried to explain the sheer intensity of your feelings for him you would only cause Ronnie more concern. Instead, you decided to attempt to express how good you had felt about yourself in the last couple of days, despite everything that happened with Mark and all the upset there. You tried to explain how easily you could make each other smile and laugh without even really speaking the same language, and how \u2013 given the amount of lies you\u2019d been subjected to throughout your life \u2013 being able to speak the same language may not always be as much of a benefit as it was perceived to be. \u201cAnd honestly Ronnie,\u201d you began to feel the butterflies flutter around in your stomach as you spoke about Taehyung, and you felt the smile on your face grow wider and wider with each word. \u201cHe just makes me feel totally, ridiculously and unbelievably happy.\u201d</p><p>He seemed at least partially satisfied with that, apparently convinced by the blatantly ecstatic look on your face as you spoke about your new-found romance. He held his hands up in mock-defeat. \u201cAlright, alright, I\u2019ll lay off. For now. But if he does anything to hurt you \u2013 \u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d you cut him off and mimed a throttling action with both your hands, before kissing him on the cheek and heading back to your room to prepare for your visit to Mark\u2019s, confident that not even your ex could ruin this feeling for you.</p><p>\u00a0~~~</p><p>Taehyung stood motionless in the doorway, his heartbeat pounding in his ears as he could feel the blood drain from his face. He clenched his fists at his side and shifted his gaze between Sang-hun and Seong-min, the eyes of the latter of the two trained somewhere above the top of Taehyung\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201c<b>What do you mean, home? We haven\u2019t finished the shoot yet. There\u2019s two more days scheduled. That\u2019s right isn\u2019t it hyung?</b>\u201d He directed his questions to Namjoon, desperately seeking reassurance from their leader.</p><p>Namjoon stood and moved next to his dongsaeng and placed a hand on his shoulder, smiling sympathetically as he did so. \u201c<b>They said they can finish it in post, Taehyung-ah. They already changed the flights.</b>\u201d He squoze his hand around the top of Taehyung\u2019s arm in an attempt to comfort and placate him.</p><p>Taehyung whipped his head round to Seong-min. \u201c<b>Why are you doing this?</b>\u201d He tried and failed to blink away the petulant tears he could feel beginning to well up in his eyes.</p><p>In the corner of his field of vision he saw Jimin rise from his seat and start to make his way over. Seong-min held up a hand to halt his movements and spoke for the first time since his return. \u201c<b>Come and speak with me.</b>\u201d He was evidently surprised by the vitriol present on the young man\u2019s face as he walked towards the door to the bedroom and opened it, gesturing for Taehyung to enter. \u201c<b>Please, Taehyung-ssi.</b>\u201d</p><p>Before deciding to comply with his manager\u2019s request he looked over to Jimin, who remained motionless stood in front of his seat, who nodded with a pleading look in his eye as a way to urge him to follow Seong-min.</p><p>Sighing deeply, he walked towards the other room, sensing all the member\u2019s eyes on him as he passed. He began to feel guilty at any trouble he had caused for his brothers through his rash decisions over the past few days. This fear was rapidly assuaged however when he felt a soft pat on the back of his leg, and he was surprised to find Yoongi smiling up at him warmly in a clear attempt at consolation; and as he vaguely heard a low \u201c<b>hyung, fighting!</b>\u201d somewhere from Jungkook\u2019s direction.</p><p>Taehyung perched on the end of the king-size bed as Seong-min closed the door. His eyes followed the manager as he leant his weight on the dresser that was facing him. The older man looked down to his shoes for a moment as he began to try and explain. \u201c<b>I didn\u2019t want for it to happen like this. I need you to understand that, okay?</b>\u201d Taehyung didn\u2019t respond and simply stared at the strangely patterned rug beneath Seong-min\u2019s feet. \u201c<b>When I found that girl in here, I thought we\u2019d had a security breach. I thought someone had broken in to your room and that your safety was at risk. By the time Jimin explained some of what happened everyone was already on alert. I tried to play it down as a misunderstanding after the\u2026erm\u2026footage from the CCTV but there wasn\u2019t a great deal I was able to do about it, the company had already started putting things in place to wind the visit up.</b>\u201d</p><p>Taehyung considered the amount of stress he must have put everyone, particularly Seong-min, under by allowing you to sleep in his room and the events that followed as a result of that decision. He was more than aware that \u2013 in retrospect \u2013 he obviously had not been thinking clearly in your presence, so taken was he with the fantasy of normality with you by his side. He chewed on his lips and raised his eyes contritely. \u201c<b>Hyung, I\u2019m \u2013</b>\u201d</p><p>But Seong-min wasn\u2019t finished, and his expression was as determined as it was regretful. \u201c<b>I need you to give me your phone, Taehyung-ssi.</b>\u201d</p><p>He placed his hand over the pocket where the device rested reflexively and sat with his mouth agape, blinking dumbly at the manager\u2019s outstretched palm. This couldn\u2019t be happening, could it? The thought of having to leave without saying goodbye was hard enough, but at least he could have called you to offer some semblance of an explanation once they had arrived home and he had some privacy. \u201c<b>Hyung\u2026</b>\u201d he trailed off quietly and felt frustration burn behind his eyes.</p><p>Seong-min\u2019s voice lowered to match the softness of Taehyung\u2019s, and he stepped forward to crouch in front of him. \u201c<b>I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s not my decision. You\u2019ll be given a replacement when we get home but I have to take your phone right now.</b>\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t understand how it had gotten to this point. He knew he had acted impulsively since they got here, but they had all done that at some point, they were human after all. Was it really just because you had slept in his room? He tried to remember if that had ever been explicitly forbidden in any of the multitude of agreements he\u2019d had to sign over the years.</p><p>As though reading his thoughts, Seong-min spoke again, walking towards the window and pretended to be taking in the view. \u201c<b>After you disappeared last night, everyone was trying to get a hold of you. You vanished alone in a strange country and no one could reach you. The company has decided that allowing you to maintain contact with this girl is too\u2026problematic.</b>\u201d</p><p>\u201c<b>Y/n.</b>\u201d Taehyung muttered under his breath as he felt a combination of rage and impotence at this turn of events.</p><p>\u201c<b>What?</b>\u201d He was clearly devastated to see his charge so obviously in distress, and even through his anger Taehyung could tell the words the manager spoke were not truly his own.</p><p>He walked towards the window to stand beside the man and touched his arm to encourage him to look his way. \u201c<b>Her name is y/n, and she hasn\u2019t done anything wrong. She doesn\u2019t even know who we are, who I am.</b>\u201d He swallowed thickly and licked his dry lips, and he felt his voice crack under the strain of his words. \u201c<b>I\u2019ll give you my phone, okay. I\u2019ll go home and I\u2019ll do everything I\u2019m told to. But\u2026please, hyung, don\u2019t make me leave without saying goodbye to her.</b>\u201d</p><p>\u00a0~~~</p><p>Something Taehyung said must have struck a chord with his manager, or maybe he had decided this would be the best way to get them all back to Korea with as little resistance as possible, either way his plea was heeded. This was how he found himself \u2013 not two hours after he had left you \u2013 speeding back towards the bar, this time with Seong-min in tow rather than Jimin, as the rest of the members and staff made for the airport.</p><p>His head throbbed and his pulse raced, his heart in his throat. He could see Seong-min glance over at him occasionally, worry etching his face, and as angry as he was he knew he could only really hold himself responsible for this eventuality. His mind alternated between replaying the time you had spent together and presenting him with alternative outcomes based on a variety of different actions he could have taken throughout that time.</p><p>When the driver pulled up to the front of the bar, it occurred to him that he didn\u2019t have any idea what he was going to say to you. How on earth could he explain his sudden departure, and for it to make sense, without telling you absolutely everything? Seong-min had told him in no uncertain terms that he had two minutes and not a moment longer, when two hours wouldn\u2019t be enough to explain the whole situation.</p><p>He swung his long legs out of the car and quickly strode to the front door, not wanting to waste one second of his brief opportunity to say goodbye and to tell you how wonderful it had been to spend time with you. He squinted through the glass and saw movement behind the bar. He rapped lightly on the door and waved at the figure on the inside, who he immediately established to be Ronnie as he approached the entrance.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d he asked breathlessly as he stared up at the large man opening the door.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not here.\u201d He simply informed him, before elaborating in response to Taehyung\u2019s blank expression. \u201cShe\u2019s gone to get her things. Her clothes and\u2026her other things. From Mark\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>At the mention of Mark\u2019s name he understood and he sighed at the poor timing. He nodded rapidly, his eyes darting back and forth as he attempted to formulate a solution. His eyes fell on the phone resting on the corner of the bar and his face lit up. \u201cI can call her?\u201d he asked carefully, walking over to the handset and pointing to it.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly is going on?\u201d Ronnie saw Taehyung\u2019s line of sight shift to the man leaning on the car parked outside the building looking at his watch, and he felt a twinge of compassion towards the panic-stricken young man, despite not having a clue what was happening. He waved his hand in agreement. \u201cFine, fine. Go ahead.\u201d</p><p>A grateful yet strained smile spread across his fine features and he lifted the handset from the cradle and held it mutely for a moment before realising he didn\u2019t know your number, and he held the phone out towards the puzzled looking older man who was switching between watching Taehyung and Seong-min outside as though spectating a tennis match. \u201cPlease will you\u2026her number?\u201d</p><p>As confused as he was, to his credit Ronnie stepped forward without asking anything further and punched your number into the keypad. There seemed to be an odd anticipation also present on his face as he watched the younger man lift the phone to his ear, his foot tapping restlessly.</p><p>The phone rang and rang and each time Taehyung heard the sound he felt his heart sink a little bit further, and as your voicemail message clicked on Seong-min approached the large window and lifted his left arm to display his watch through the pane of glass.</p><p>Taehyung exhaled loudly as he hung up, before beginning to turn on the spot to look around the room for inspiration. He turned to Ronnie who still stood dumbly in the middle of the room, looking utterly bemused by the strange young man spinning around behind his bar. \u201cDo you have a pen?\u201d he asked frantically as his eyes landed on a pile of napkins, immensely thankful that \u2018pen\u2019 was one of the words that didn\u2019t require any translation.</p><p>Ronnie reached in to the pocket of the apron he wore tied around his waist and produced a pencil, handing it over to Taehyung and watching as he leant over the napkins, the pencil motionless in his hand as he frowned and tried to work out what to write.</p><p>A persistent tapping began from outside and a frustrated groan left Taehyung\u2019s lips. So far he had only managed to write your name, having already practiced the letters and spelling when he left you the note back at the hotel.</p><p>Further than that however, his mind refused to cooperate, and \u2013 not for the first time \u2013 he wished he had paid more attention in the numerous English lessons he had been subjected to. He reached behind his head and unhooked the necklace that rested there most days and slid one of the pendants from it, securing the chain back around his neck once he had done so. He took hold of the pencil again to complete the note, before pressing the red tiger pendant in to the paper and folding it securely inside before handing it to Ronnie, his eyes wet with unshed tears.</p><p>He had wanted desperately to tell you much he regretted leaving you. He wanted you to know just how insanely grateful he was that you had pressed the wrong button in that lift. How he wished he could stay here with you and make you understand just how much your time together had meant. Lastly and most importantly, how - no matter what might happen - all he wanted was for you be happy, even if it isn\u2019t because of him.</p><p>But there was simply not enough time and he lacked the necessary knowledge to articulate everything he wanted to say. Instead, he had written two words and one letter:</p><p>\u201c<i>I\u2019m sorry. V.</i>\u201d</p><p><b><i>A/N Chapter 14 to be posted next Friday!!</i></b></p></p>",

It was as though you couldn\u2019t bear to go back inside the bar, as if that would be drawing a line under the time you\u2019d spent together, officially bringing it to a close. Kind of like the in-person equivalent of \u201cyou hang up first\u201d.</p><p>As the cab finally turned out of sight, you stared at the empty road it had previously occupied and envisioned a car bringing Taehyung back to you the same way later that day, hugging your arms around yourself and allowing a smile to take over your face as you thought about the past few hours and speculated what future hours together may involve.</p><p>Finally turning to push open the bar door, you could see Ronnie examining an imaginary smudge on the window with a level of faux-concentration so intense that it made it glaringly obvious he had been keeping watch on the two of you as you said your goodbyes.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cEverything okay there?\u201d You pushed the door closed behind you and hopped on the stool facing the one Ronnie perched atop. You sighed dramatically in response to his heavily loaded question and rested your chin in your upturned palm, grinning widely at him. \u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes then, should I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just honestly didn\u2019t believe that people like that existed.\u201d You knew that if you could see your own behaviour you\u2019d most likely be sticking your fingers down your throat and making pretend gagging noises. As it was however you simply sighed again and touched your fingers to your lips, as though to seal Taehyung\u2019s touch to them, only partially noticing Ronnie\u2019s offended facial expression.</p><p>\u201cHow can you say such a thing,\u201d he raised his hand to his chest and pressed just his fingertips to it, the very image of affronted \u201cwhen you know\u00a0<i>I</i>\u00a0exist?\u201d</p><p>You leant forward and tapped the top of his hand fondly. \u201cOf course Ronnie, that\u2019s precisely why: you\u2019ve given me such unrealistic expectations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstandable.\u201d He seemed content with your answer and shifted in his seat, his face serious again, eyeing you questioningly with unspoken worry lining his face. \u201cSo\u2026is this guy going to be around for a while?\u201d</p><p>You sat back in your seat, turning your gaze to stare out of the window, the smile on your face becoming wistful. \u201cNo,\u201d you began, and in your periphery you could see his shoulders relax. \u201cHe has to go home in a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where is that?\u201d You noticed for the first time that he was drinking coffee rather than beer as he lifted his mug to his lips and peered at you over the rim.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really sure.\u201d You answered honestly and forcibly bright, reluctant to admit to yourself the gravity of the truth in your reply. Of course you had managed to work out what country he was from and the language he spoke, but that didn\u2019t necessarily mean that was where he was travelling back to.</p><p>Ronnie had been a positive force in your life for as long as you could remember. You knew this inquisition was coming from a place of love and a desire to protect you after you had been failed so often in the past, however you could feel yourself becoming tense as he struggled to keep the relief from his expression at your answers to his questions.</p><p>He placed the mug back on the high table and rested his hands flat on the surface either side of it. It was obvious he was trying to formulate a sentence, one that you were unlikely to want to hear, as he inhaled deeply before opening his mouth. \u201cHow much do you really know about him, y/n?\u201d</p><p>You huffed and rose from your stool to pour yourself a coffee from the pot Ronnie had left on the end of the bar by the phone. Your eyes lingered on the handset in the cradle as the dark liquid filled the cup and remained there as you brought the drink to your lips, wondering how the last couple of days would have gone had you not used it to locate your own phone. Your musings were broken as the bitter drink hit your tongue, and it suddenly became apparent why Ronnie usually opted for beer. \u201cYou are not good at making coffee,\u201d you informed him as you tipped the contents of your cup and remnants of the pot down the sink at the back of the bar and set about brewing a fresh batch.</p><p>Ronnie followed your movement away from the window and handed over his own mug, silently acquiescing to the poor quality of the drink, still keeping his eyes on your face through the mirror behind the bottles lined up on display. The only sound in the room was the gentle clinking of the crockery as you poured out two mugs, pushing one across the bar\u2019s surface towards Ronnie, still avoiding his question.</p><p>He sipped the drink and made a light smacking noise with his mouth in appreciation for the improved taste. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to see you get hurt again, y/n,\u201d he tried to explain. \u201cI saw you with that idiot for four years and it literally ended the day before yesterday. And this\u2026this boy appears out nowhere and \u2013 well, you would have to be blind to not be able to see how taken you are with him.\u201d</p><p>You could feel your heart sink a little at his words, but hearing the genuine concern in his voice reminded you of how important his opinion was to you, and that he had always had your best interests at heart. \u201cDo you think I\u2019ve read more in to this than there really is?\u201d</p><p>You saw his eyebrows draw together as he shook his head emphatically. \u201cNo, not at all, I \u2013 God, Hannah is so much better than me at this stuff.\u201d He rubbed his hand over the back of his head, clearly frustrated at his lack of eloquence. He took a deep breath and waited for you to meet his eyes. \u201cHe looks at you the way I imagine I looked at Maggie.\u201d</p><p>You softened at the mention of Hannah\u2019s mother\u2019s name. He rarely mentioned her, and the slightly pained look which crossed his face was confirmation of the weight of his words. You stepped around the bar to wrap your arms around him, ashamed that your actions had somehow caused him distress at the memory of her. \u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry Ronnie.\u201d</p><p>He returned your hug briefly before clearing his throat and checking himself for his minor display of vulnerability, patting you on the back in both reassurance and as an indication that the moment had mostly passed. \u201cListen, I think whatever is going on between you two is more than just a bit of a fling. Really, I do. But you\u2019re not stupid y/n, you know as well as I do that sometimes things just can\u2019t happen, no matter how well-intentioned the people involved start off. I can\u2019t see you be let down again, okay?\u201d</p><p>You understood perfectly why he was worried, you had already told yourself the same things dozens of times since you met Taehyung. You knew that if you tried to explain the sheer intensity of your feelings for him you would only cause Ronnie more concern. Instead, you decided to attempt to express how good you had felt about yourself in the last couple of days, despite everything that happened with Mark and all the upset there. You tried to explain how easily you could make each other smile and laugh without even really speaking the same language, and how \u2013 given the amount of lies you\u2019d been subjected to throughout your life \u2013 being able to speak the same language may not always be as much of a benefit as it was perceived to be. \u201cAnd honestly Ronnie,\u201d you began to feel the butterflies flutter around in your stomach as you spoke about Taehyung, and you felt the smile on your face grow wider and wider with each word. \u201cHe just makes me feel totally, ridiculously and unbelievably happy.\u201d</p><p>He seemed at least partially satisfied with that, apparently convinced by the blatantly ecstatic look on your face as you spoke about your new-found romance. He held his hands up in mock-defeat. \u201cAlright, alright, I\u2019ll lay off. For now. But if he does anything to hurt you \u2013 \u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d you cut him off and mimed a throttling action with both your hands, before kissing him on the cheek and heading back to your room to prepare for your visit to Mark\u2019s, confident that not even your ex could ruin this feeling for you.</p><p>\u00a0~~~</p><p>Taehyung stood motionless in the doorway, his heartbeat pounding in his ears as he could feel the blood drain from his face. He clenched his fists at his side and shifted his gaze between Sang-hun and Seong-min, the eyes of the latter of the two trained somewhere above the top of Taehyung\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201c<b>What do you mean, home? We haven\u2019t finished the shoot yet. There\u2019s two more days scheduled. That\u2019s right isn\u2019t it hyung?</b>\u201d He directed his questions to Namjoon, desperately seeking reassurance from their leader.</p><p>Namjoon stood and moved next to his dongsaeng and placed a hand on his shoulder, smiling sympathetically as he did so. \u201c<b>They said they can finish it in post, Taehyung-ah. They already changed the flights.</b>\u201d He squoze his hand around the top of Taehyung\u2019s arm in an attempt to comfort and placate him.</p><p>Taehyung whipped his head round to Seong-min. \u201c<b>Why are you doing this?</b>\u201d He tried and failed to blink away the petulant tears he could feel beginning to well up in his eyes.</p><p>In the corner of his field of vision he saw Jimin rise from his seat and start to make his way over. Seong-min held up a hand to halt his movements and spoke for the first time since his return. \u201c<b>Come and speak with me.</b>\u201d He was evidently surprised by the vitriol present on the young man\u2019s face as he walked towards the door to the bedroom and opened it, gesturing for Taehyung to enter. \u201c<b>Please, Taehyung-ssi.</b>\u201d</p><p>Before deciding to comply with his manager\u2019s request he looked over to Jimin, who remained motionless stood in front of his seat, who nodded with a pleading look in his eye as a way to urge him to follow Seong-min.</p><p>Sighing deeply, he walked towards the other room, sensing all the member\u2019s eyes on him as he passed. He began to feel guilty at any trouble he had caused for his brothers through his rash decisions over the past few days. This fear was rapidly assuaged however when he felt a soft pat on the back of his leg, and he was surprised to find Yoongi smiling up at him warmly in a clear attempt at consolation; and as he vaguely heard a low \u201c<b>hyung, fighting!</b>\u201d somewhere from Jungkook\u2019s direction.</p><p>Taehyung perched on the end of the king-size bed as Seong-min closed the door. His eyes followed the manager as he leant his weight on the dresser that was facing him. The older man looked down to his shoes for a moment as he began to try and explain. \u201c<b>I didn\u2019t want for it to happen like this. I need you to understand that, okay?</b>\u201d Taehyung didn\u2019t respond and simply stared at the strangely patterned rug beneath Seong-min\u2019s feet. \u201c<b>When I found that girl in here, I thought we\u2019d had a security breach. I thought someone had broken in to your room and that your safety was at risk. By the time Jimin explained some of what happened everyone was already on alert. I tried to play it down as a misunderstanding after the\u2026erm\u2026footage from the CCTV but there wasn\u2019t a great deal I was able to do about it, the company had already started putting things in place to wind the visit up.</b>\u201d</p><p>Taehyung considered the amount of stress he must have put everyone, particularly Seong-min, under by allowing you to sleep in his room and the events that followed as a result of that decision. He was more than aware that \u2013 in retrospect \u2013 he obviously had not been thinking clearly in your presence, so taken was he with the fantasy of normality with you by his side. He chewed on his lips and raised his eyes contritely. \u201c<b>Hyung, I\u2019m \u2013</b>\u201d</p><p>But Seong-min wasn\u2019t finished, and his expression was as determined as it was regretful. \u201c<b>I need you to give me your phone, Taehyung-ssi.</b>\u201d</p><p>He placed his hand over the pocket where the device rested reflexively and sat with his mouth agape, blinking dumbly at the manager\u2019s outstretched palm. This couldn\u2019t be happening, could it? The thought of having to leave without saying goodbye was hard enough, but at least he could have called you to offer some semblance of an explanation once they had arrived home and he had some privacy. \u201c<b>Hyung\u2026</b>\u201d he trailed off quietly and felt frustration burn behind his eyes.</p><p>Seong-min\u2019s voice lowered to match the softness of Taehyung\u2019s, and he stepped forward to crouch in front of him. \u201c<b>I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s not my decision. You\u2019ll be given a replacement when we get home but I have to take your phone right now.</b>\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t understand how it had gotten to this point. He knew he had acted impulsively since they got here, but they had all done that at some point, they were human after all. Was it really just because you had slept in his room? He tried to remember if that had ever been explicitly forbidden in any of the multitude of agreements he\u2019d had to sign over the years.</p><p>As though reading his thoughts, Seong-min spoke again, walking towards the window and pretended to be taking in the view. \u201c<b>After you disappeared last night, everyone was trying to get a hold of you. You vanished alone in a strange country and no one could reach you. The company has decided that allowing you to maintain contact with this girl is too\u2026problematic.</b>\u201d</p><p>\u201c<b>Y/n.</b>\u201d Taehyung muttered under his breath as he felt a combination of rage and impotence at this turn of events.</p><p>\u201c<b>What?</b>\u201d He was clearly devastated to see his charge so obviously in distress, and even through his anger Taehyung could tell the words the manager spoke were not truly his own.</p><p>He walked towards the window to stand beside the man and touched his arm to encourage him to look his way. \u201c<b>Her name is y/n, and she hasn\u2019t done anything wrong. She doesn\u2019t even know who we are, who I am.</b>\u201d He swallowed thickly and licked his dry lips, and he felt his voice crack under the strain of his words. \u201c<b>I\u2019ll give you my phone, okay. I\u2019ll go home and I\u2019ll do everything I\u2019m told to. But\u2026please, hyung, don\u2019t make me leave without saying goodbye to her.</b>\u201d</p><p>\u00a0~~~</p><p>Something Taehyung said must have struck a chord with his manager, or maybe he had decided this would be the best way to get them all back to Korea with as little resistance as possible, either way his plea was heeded. This was how he found himself \u2013 not two hours after he had left you \u2013 speeding back towards the bar, this time with Seong-min in tow rather than Jimin, as the rest of the members and staff made for the airport.</p><p>His head throbbed and his pulse raced, his heart in his throat. He could see Seong-min glance over at him occasionally, worry etching his face, and as angry as he was he knew he could only really hold himself responsible for this eventuality. His mind alternated between replaying the time you had spent together and presenting him with alternative outcomes based on a variety of different actions he could have taken throughout that time.</p><p>When the driver pulled up to the front of the bar, it occurred to him that he didn\u2019t have any idea what he was going to say to you. How on earth could he explain his sudden departure, and for it to make sense, without telling you absolutely everything? Seong-min had told him in no uncertain terms that he had two minutes and not a moment longer, when two hours wouldn\u2019t be enough to explain the whole situation.</p><p>He swung his long legs out of the car and quickly strode to the front door, not wanting to waste one second of his brief opportunity to say goodbye and to tell you how wonderful it had been to spend time with you. He squinted through the glass and saw movement behind the bar. He rapped lightly on the door and waved at the figure on the inside, who he immediately established to be Ronnie as he approached the entrance.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d he asked breathlessly as he stared up at the large man opening the door.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not here.\u201d He simply informed him, before elaborating in response to Taehyung\u2019s blank expression. \u201cShe\u2019s gone to get her things. Her clothes and\u2026her other things. From Mark\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>At the mention of Mark\u2019s name he understood and he sighed at the poor timing. He nodded rapidly, his eyes darting back and forth as he attempted to formulate a solution. His eyes fell on the phone resting on the corner of the bar and his face lit up. \u201cI can call her?\u201d he asked carefully, walking over to the handset and pointing to it.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly is going on?\u201d Ronnie saw Taehyung\u2019s line of sight shift to the man leaning on the car parked outside the building looking at his watch, and he felt a twinge of compassion towards the panic-stricken young man, despite not having a clue what was happening. He waved his hand in agreement. \u201cFine, fine. Go ahead.\u201d</p><p>A grateful yet strained smile spread across his fine features and he lifted the handset from the cradle and held it mutely for a moment before realising he didn\u2019t know your number, and he held the phone out towards the puzzled looking older man who was switching between watching Taehyung and Seong-min outside as though spectating a tennis match. \u201cPlease will you\u2026her number?\u201d</p><p>As confused as he was, to his credit Ronnie stepped forward without asking anything further and punched your number into the keypad. There seemed to be an odd anticipation also present on his face as he watched the younger man lift the phone to his ear, his foot tapping restlessly.</p><p>The phone rang and rang and each time Taehyung heard the sound he felt his heart sink a little bit further, and as your voicemail message clicked on Seong-min approached the large window and lifted his left arm to display his watch through the pane of glass.</p><p>Taehyung exhaled loudly as he hung up, before beginning to turn on the spot to look around the room for inspiration. He turned to Ronnie who still stood dumbly in the middle of the room, looking utterly bemused by the strange young man spinning around behind his bar. \u201cDo you have a pen?\u201d he asked frantically as his eyes landed on a pile of napkins, immensely thankful that \u2018pen\u2019 was one of the words that didn\u2019t require any translation.</p><p>Ronnie reached in to the pocket of the apron he wore tied around his waist and produced a pencil, handing it over to Taehyung and watching as he leant over the napkins, the pencil motionless in his hand as he frowned and tried to work out what to write.</p><p>A persistent tapping began from outside and a frustrated groan left Taehyung\u2019s lips. So far he had only managed to write your name, having already practiced the letters and spelling when he left you the note back at the hotel.</p><p>Further than that however, his mind refused to cooperate, and \u2013 not for the first time \u2013 he wished he had paid more attention in the numerous English lessons he had been subjected to. He reached behind his head and unhooked the necklace that rested there most days and slid one of the pendants from it, securing the chain back around his neck once he had done so. He took hold of the pencil again to complete the note, before pressing the red tiger pendant in to the paper and folding it securely inside before handing it to Ronnie, his eyes wet with unshed tears.</p><p>He had wanted desperately to tell you much he regretted leaving you. He wanted you to know just how insanely grateful he was that you had pressed the wrong button in that lift. How he wished he could stay here with you and make you understand just how much your time together had meant. Lastly and most importantly, how - no matter what might happen - all he wanted was for you be happy, even if it isn\u2019t because of him.</p><p>But there was simply not enough time and he lacked the necessary knowledge to articulate everything he wanted to say. Instead, he had written two words and one letter:</p><p>\u201c<i>I\u2019m sorry. V.</i>\u201d</p><p><b><i>A/N Chapter 14 to be posted next Friday!!</i></b></p></p>",

It was as though you couldn&rsquo;t bear to go back inside the bar, as if that would be drawing a line under the time you&rsquo;d spent together, officially bringing it to a close. Kind of like the in-person equivalent of &ldquo;you hang up first&rdquo;.</p><p>As the cab finally turned out of sight, you stared at the empty road it had previously occupied and envisioned a car bringing Taehyung back to you the same way later that day, hugging your arms around yourself and allowing a smile to take over your face as you thought about the past few hours and speculated what future hours together may involve.</p><p>Finally turning to push open the bar door, you could see Ronnie examining an imaginary smudge on the window with a level of faux-concentration so intense that it made it glaringly obvious he had been keeping watch on the two of you as you said your goodbyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Everything okay there?&rdquo; You pushed the door closed behind you and hopped on the stool facing the one Ronnie perched atop. You sighed dramatically in response to his heavily loaded question and rested your chin in your upturned palm, grinning widely at him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take that as a yes then, should I?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I just honestly didn&rsquo;t believe that people like that existed.&rdquo; You knew that if you could see your own behaviour you&rsquo;d most likely be sticking your fingers down your throat and making pretend gagging noises. As it was however you simply sighed again and touched your fingers to your lips, as though to seal Taehyung&rsquo;s touch to them, only partially noticing Ronnie&rsquo;s offended facial expression.</p><p>&ldquo;How can you say such a thing,&rdquo; he raised his hand to his chest and pressed just his fingertips to it, the very image of affronted &ldquo;when you know&nbsp;<i>I</i>&nbsp;exist?&rdquo;</p><p>You leant forward and tapped the top of his hand fondly. &ldquo;Of course Ronnie, that&rsquo;s precisely why: you&rsquo;ve given me such unrealistic expectations.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Understandable.&rdquo; He seemed content with your answer and shifted in his seat, his face serious again, eyeing you questioningly with unspoken worry lining his face. &ldquo;So&hellip;is this guy going to be around for a while?&rdquo;</p><p>You sat back in your seat, turning your gaze to stare out of the window, the smile on your face becoming wistful. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; you began, and in your periphery you could see his shoulders relax. &ldquo;He has to go home in a couple of days.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And where is that?&rdquo; You noticed for the first time that he was drinking coffee rather than beer as he lifted his mug to his lips and peered at you over the rim.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not really sure.&rdquo; You answered honestly and forcibly bright, reluctant to admit to yourself the gravity of the truth in your reply. Of course you had managed to work out what country he was from and the language he spoke, but that didn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that was where he was travelling back to.</p><p>Ronnie had been a positive force in your life for as long as you could remember. You knew this inquisition was coming from a place of love and a desire to protect you after you had been failed so often in the past, however you could feel yourself becoming tense as he struggled to keep the relief from his expression at your answers to his questions.</p><p>He placed the mug back on the high table and rested his hands flat on the surface either side of it. It was obvious he was trying to formulate a sentence, one that you were unlikely to want to hear, as he inhaled deeply before opening his mouth. &ldquo;How much do you really know about him, y/n?&rdquo;</p><p>You huffed and rose from your stool to pour yourself a coffee from the pot Ronnie had left on the end of the bar by the phone. Your eyes lingered on the handset in the cradle as the dark liquid filled the cup and remained there as you brought the drink to your lips, wondering how the last couple of days would have gone had you not used it to locate your own phone. Your musings were broken as the bitter drink hit your tongue, and it suddenly became apparent why Ronnie usually opted for beer. &ldquo;You are not good at making coffee,&rdquo; you informed him as you tipped the contents of your cup and remnants of the pot down the sink at the back of the bar and set about brewing a fresh batch.</p><p>Ronnie followed your movement away from the window and handed over his own mug, silently acquiescing to the poor quality of the drink, still keeping his eyes on your face through the mirror behind the bottles lined up on display. The only sound in the room was the gentle clinking of the crockery as you poured out two mugs, pushing one across the bar&rsquo;s surface towards Ronnie, still avoiding his question.</p><p>He sipped the drink and made a light smacking noise with his mouth in appreciation for the improved taste. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t want to see you get hurt again, y/n,&rdquo; he tried to explain. &ldquo;I saw you with that idiot for four years and it literally ended the day before yesterday. And this&hellip;this boy appears out nowhere and &ndash; well, you would have to be blind to not be able to see how taken you are with him.&rdquo;</p><p>You could feel your heart sink a little at his words, but hearing the genuine concern in his voice reminded you of how important his opinion was to you, and that he had always had your best interests at heart. &ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;ve read more in to this than there really is?&rdquo;</p><p>You saw his eyebrows draw together as he shook his head emphatically. &ldquo;No, not at all, I &ndash; God, Hannah is so much better than me at this stuff.&rdquo; He rubbed his hand over the back of his head, clearly frustrated at his lack of eloquence. He took a deep breath and waited for you to meet his eyes. &ldquo;He looks at you the way I imagine I looked at Maggie.&rdquo;</p><p>You softened at the mention of Hannah&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s name. He rarely mentioned her, and the slightly pained look which crossed his face was confirmation of the weight of his words. You stepped around the bar to wrap your arms around him, ashamed that your actions had somehow caused him distress at the memory of her. &ldquo;Ah, I&rsquo;m sorry Ronnie.&rdquo;</p><p>He returned your hug briefly before clearing his throat and checking himself for his minor display of vulnerability, patting you on the back in both reassurance and as an indication that the moment had mostly passed. &ldquo;Listen, I think whatever is going on between you two is more than just a bit of a fling. Really, I do. But you&rsquo;re not stupid y/n, you know as well as I do that sometimes things just can&rsquo;t happen, no matter how well-intentioned the people involved start off. I can&rsquo;t see you be let down again, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>You understood perfectly why he was worried, you had already told yourself the same things dozens of times since you met Taehyung.

He clenched his fists at his side and shifted his gaze between Sang-hun and Seong-min, the eyes of the latter of the two trained somewhere above the top of Taehyung&rsquo;s head.</p><p>&ldquo;<b>What do you mean, home? We haven&rsquo;t finished the shoot yet. There&rsquo;s two more days scheduled. That&rsquo;s right isn&rsquo;t it hyung?</b>&rdquo; He directed his questions to Namjoon, desperately seeking reassurance from their leader.</p><p>Namjoon stood and moved next to his dongsaeng and placed a hand on his shoulder, smiling sympathetically as he did so. &ldquo;<b>They said they can finish it in post, Taehyung-ah. They already changed the flights.</b>&rdquo; He squoze his hand around the top of Taehyung&rsquo;s arm in an attempt to comfort and placate him.</p><p>Taehyung whipped his head round to Seong-min. &ldquo;<b>Why are you doing this?</b>&rdquo; He tried and failed to blink away the petulant tears he could feel beginning to well up in his eyes.</p><p>In the corner of his field of vision he saw Jimin rise from his seat and start to make his way over. Seong-min held up a hand to halt his movements and spoke for the first time since his return. &ldquo;<b>Come and speak with me.</b>&rdquo; He was evidently surprised by the vitriol present on the young man&rsquo;s face as he walked towards the door to the bedroom and opened it, gesturing for Taehyung to enter. &ldquo;<b>Please, Taehyung-ssi.</b>&rdquo;</p><p>Before deciding to comply with his manager&rsquo;s request he looked over to Jimin, who remained motionless stood in front of his seat, who nodded with a pleading look in his eye as a way to urge him to follow Seong-min.</p><p>Sighing deeply, he walked towards the other room, sensing all the member&rsquo;s eyes on him as he passed. He began to feel guilty at any trouble he had caused for his brothers through his rash decisions over the past few days. This fear was rapidly assuaged however when he felt a soft pat on the back of his leg, and he was surprised to find Yoongi smiling up at him warmly in a clear attempt at consolation; and as he vaguely heard a low &ldquo;<b>hyung, fighting!</b>&rdquo; somewhere from Jungkook&rsquo;s direction.</p><p>Taehyung perched on the end of the king-size bed as Seong-min closed the door. His eyes followed the manager as he leant his weight on the dresser that was facing him. The older man looked down to his shoes for a moment as he began to try and explain. &ldquo;<b>I didn&rsquo;t want for it to happen like this. I need you to understand that, okay?</b>&rdquo; Taehyung didn&rsquo;t respond and simply stared at the strangely patterned rug beneath Seong-min&rsquo;s feet. &ldquo;<b>When I found that girl in here, I thought we&rsquo;d had a security breach. I thought someone had broken in to your room and that your safety was at risk. By the time Jimin explained some of what happened everyone was already on alert. I tried to play it down as a misunderstanding after the&hellip;erm&hellip;footage from the CCTV but there wasn&rsquo;t a great deal I was able to do about it, the company had already started putting things in place to wind the visit up.</b>&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung considered the amount of stress he must have put everyone, particularly Seong-min, under by allowing you to sleep in his room and the events that followed as a result of that decision. He was more than aware that &ndash; in retrospect &ndash; he obviously had not been thinking clearly in your presence, so taken was he with the fantasy of normality with you by his side. He chewed on his lips and raised his eyes contritely. &ldquo;<b>Hyung, I&rsquo;m &ndash;</b>&rdquo;</p><p>But Seong-min wasn&rsquo;t finished, and his expression was as determined as it was regretful. &ldquo;<b>I need you to give me your phone, Taehyung-ssi.</b>&rdquo;</p><p>He placed his hand over the pocket where the device rested reflexively and sat with his mouth agape, blinking dumbly at the manager&rsquo;s outstretched palm. This couldn&rsquo;t be happening, could it? The thought of having to leave without saying goodbye was hard enough, but at least he could have called you to offer some semblance of an explanation once they had arrived home and he had some privacy. &ldquo;<b>Hyung&hellip;</b>&rdquo; he trailed off quietly and felt frustration burn behind his eyes.</p><p>Seong-min&rsquo;s voice lowered to match the softness of Taehyung&rsquo;s, and he stepped forward to crouch in front of him. &ldquo;<b>I&rsquo;m sorry, it&rsquo;s not my decision. You&rsquo;ll be given a replacement when we get home but I have to take your phone right now.</b>&rdquo;</p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t understand how it had gotten to this point. He knew he had acted impulsively since they got here, but they had all done that at some point, they were human after all. Was it really just because you had slept in his room? He tried to remember if that had ever been explicitly forbidden in any of the multitude of agreements he&rsquo;d had to sign over the years.</p><p>As though reading his thoughts, Seong-min spoke again, walking towards the window and pretended to be taking in the view. &ldquo;<b>After you disappeared last night, everyone was trying to get a hold of you. You vanished alone in a strange country and no one could reach you. The company has decided that allowing you to maintain contact with this girl is too&hellip;problematic.</b>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<b>Y/n.</b>&rdquo; Taehyung muttered under his breath as he felt a combination of rage and impotence at this turn of events.</p><p>&ldquo;<b>What?</b>&rdquo; He was clearly devastated to see his charge so obviously in distress, and even through his anger Taehyung could tell the words the manager spoke were not truly his own.</p><p>He walked towards the window to stand beside the man and touched his arm to encourage him to look his way. &ldquo;<b>Her name is y/n, and she hasn&rsquo;t done anything wrong. She doesn&rsquo;t even know who we are, who I am.</b>&rdquo; He swallowed thickly and licked his dry lips, and he felt his voice crack under the strain of his words. &ldquo;<b>I&rsquo;ll give you my phone, okay. I&rsquo;ll go home and I&rsquo;ll do everything I&rsquo;m told to. But&hellip;please, hyung, don&rsquo;t make me leave without saying goodbye to her.</b>&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;~~~</p><p>Something Taehyung said must have struck a chord with his manager, or maybe he had decided this would be the best way to get them all back to Korea with as little resistance as possible, either way his plea was heeded. This was how he found himself &ndash; not two hours after he had left you &ndash; speeding back towards the bar, this time with Seong-min in tow rather than Jimin, as the rest of the members and staff made for the airport.</p><p>His head throbbed and his pulse raced, his heart in his throat. He could see Seong-min glance over at him occasionally, worry etching his face, and as angry as he was he knew he could only really hold himself responsible for this eventuality. His mind alternated between replaying the time you had spent together and presenting him with alternative outcomes based on a variety of different actions he could have taken throughout that time.</p><p>When the driver pulled up to the front of the bar, it occurred to him that he didn&rsquo;t have any idea what he was going to say to you. How on earth could he explain his sudden departure, and for it to make sense, without telling you absolutely everything? Seong-min had told him in no uncertain terms that he had two minutes and not a moment longer, when two hours wouldn&rsquo;t be enough to explain the whole situation.</p><p>He swung his long legs out of the car and quickly strode to the front door, not wanting to waste one second of his brief opportunity to say goodbye and to tell you how wonderful it had been to spend time with you. He squinted through the glass and saw movement behind the bar. He rapped lightly on the door and waved at the figure on the inside, who he immediately established to be Ronnie as he approached the entrance.</p><p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; he asked breathlessly as he stared up at the large man opening the door.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not here.&rdquo; He simply informed him, before elaborating in response to Taehyung&rsquo;s blank expression. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone to get her things. Her clothes and&hellip;her other things. From Mark&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>At the mention of Mark&rsquo;s name he understood and he sighed at the poor timing. He nodded rapidly, his eyes darting back and forth as he attempted to formulate a solution. His eyes fell on the phone resting on the corner of the bar and his face lit up. &ldquo;I can call her?&rdquo; he asked carefully, walking over to the handset and pointing to it.</p><p>&ldquo;What exactly is going on?&rdquo; Ronnie saw Taehyung&rsquo;s line of sight shift to the man leaning on the car parked outside the building looking at his watch, and he felt a twinge of compassion towards the panic-stricken young man, despite not having a clue what was happening. He waved his hand in agreement. &ldquo;Fine, fine. Go ahead.&rdquo;</p><p>A grateful yet strained smile spread across his fine features and he lifted the handset from the cradle and held it mutely for a moment before realising he didn&rsquo;t know your number, and he held the phone out towards the puzzled looking older man who was switching between watching Taehyung and Seong-min outside as though spectating a tennis match. &ldquo;Please will you&hellip;her number?&rdquo;</p><p>As confused as he was, to his credit Ronnie stepped forward without asking anything further and punched your number into the keypad. There seemed to be an odd anticipation also present on his face as he watched the younger man lift the phone to his ear, his foot tapping restlessly.</p><p>The phone rang and rang and each time Taehyung heard the sound he felt his heart sink a little bit further, and as your voicemail message clicked on Seong-min approached the large window and lifted his left arm to display his watch through the pane of glass.</p><p>Taehyung exhaled loudly as he hung up, before beginning to turn on the spot to look around the room for inspiration. He turned to Ronnie who still stood dumbly in the middle of the room, looking utterly bemused by the strange young man spinning around behind his bar. &ldquo;Do you have a pen?&rdquo; he asked frantically as his eyes landed on a pile of napkins, immensely thankful that &lsquo;pen&rsquo; was one of the words that didn&rsquo;t require any translation.</p><p>Ronnie reached in to the pocket of the apron he wore tied around his waist and produced a pencil, handing it over to Taehyung and watching as he leant over the napkins, the pencil motionless in his hand as he frowned and tried to work out what to write.</p><p>A persistent tapping began from outside and a frustrated groan left Taehyung&rsquo;s lips. So far he had only managed to write your name, having already practiced the letters and spelling when he left you the note back at the hotel.</p><p>Further than that however, his mind refused to cooperate, and &ndash; not for the first time &ndash; he wished he had paid more attention in the numerous English lessons he had been subjected to. He reached behind his head and unhooked the necklace that rested there most days and slid one of the pendants from it, securing the chain back around his neck once he had done so. He took hold of the pencil again to complete the note, before pressing the red tiger pendant in to the paper and folding it securely inside before handing it to Ronnie, his eyes wet with unshed tears.</p><p>He had wanted desperately to tell you much he regretted leaving you. He wanted you to know just how insanely grateful he was that you had pressed the wrong button in that lift. How he wished he could stay here with you and make you understand just how much your time together had meant. Lastly and most importantly, how - no matter what might happen - all he wanted was for you be happy, even if it isn&rsquo;t because of him.</p><p>But there was simply not enough time and he lacked the necessary knowledge to articulate everything he wanted to say. Instead, he had written two words and one letter:</p><p>&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m sorry. V.</i>&rdquo;</p><p><b><i>A/N Chapter 14 to be posted next Friday!!</i></b></p></p>",

It\u2019s been a long day, and every single bone in his body hurts like you wouldn\u2019t believe. He\u2019s feeling pretty grumpy on top of that, which definitely isn\u2019t ideal. He was meant to spend time today with you and your child, but he\u2019s not quite sure if he\u2019s up to it. Well, he thinks that until he gets into the kitchen and sees the two of you giggling and working,</p><p>\u201cDaddy\u2019s home!\u201d You tease, looking up with a smile before focussing back on the task at hand. If you don\u2019t watch your son with the homemade noodles, he\u2019ll throw a handful again like earlier.</p><p><b>Jin</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"178\" data-orig-width=\"178\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"rapdaegu:sdK_lQnHOEQ6TixEQbBfAg:ZEwKZh2LKsGHI\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/70caced8a5d7206e6eabe77b39e83796/tumblr_ophkvgDj9N1vpp6avo9_250.gif\" data-orig-height=\"178\" data-orig-width=\"178\"/></figure><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, but Daddy had a long day at work today,\u201d Jin replies easily, noting how you inwardly cringe. The name \u2018Daddy\u2019 is something of an inside joke for the two of you, both because Jin is more the mothering type with his group, and that the very sound of it is enough to make the both of your cringe. Jin doesn\u2019t mind though, it\u2019s worth it for your light-hearted giggle as you come over with your mucky hands to kiss him,</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re making fresh noodles. Does the Chef of the house wish to impart his knowledge,\u201d You jab, making sure to keep your hands away from Jin\u2019s clean (if slightly sweaty) shirt. From the carefree smile on his face - the kind of smile that only his family can give him - you wouldn\u2019t guess that Jin\u2019s been worked to the bone,</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you need it! Look at this little Chef here he\u2019ll put me out of the job!\u201d Jin exaggerates in the way only he can, ruffling his son\u2019s hair gently as he plays with the noodles like they\u2019re Play-Doh.</p><p><b>Hoseok</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"400\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"ariescults:MmIQye2V7xjTFNoGrRqYZQ:ZN7wfd2TjmNL7\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7fc4fe7f7fb2a03ffbec87b1d3d717fa/tumblr_p235d9qJBi1ws9xlgo1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"400\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p>Hoseok chokes up just a little bit. Seeing his son laughing with his smile and your eyes is an indescribable feeling, especially as he mashes the \u2018noodle goop\u2019 (as he has named it) around the table, despite your attempts at making him do it properly. The toddler is stood up on a stool, but he can still hardly reach the table top. Hoseok can only just about see his eyes, and it\u2019s the cutest thing,</p><p>\u201cHey there, beautiful,\u201d Hoseok chimes in, slipping his jacket off so he can hug you comfortably. You\u2019re making noodles together, so Hoseok knows better than to interfere with it! You\u2019re defensive of your cooking, so he has to settle for hugging your back and kissing up your neck ever so gently. You still shiver at the feeling and turn around to kiss him gently, </p><p>\u201cYucky,\u201d Your son mutters, poking his noodles grumpily as he watches his parents love each other. You and Hoseok break apart with a smile, unable to look at your son with anything but absolute love and fondness.</p><p><b>Taehyung</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"372\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"baepsae0:Z9ojIEnSG1BSLddwE3EXXQ:Zs-_7c2Utr6IY\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7fbbac46de6dd4ce9019fd31de202141/tumblr_p3r29tJ0S71whwf5vo1_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"372\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><p>The second that Taehyung sees the two of you - his beautiful girlfriend and his equally as beautiful son - any stress that was on his shoulders melts away. To see the two of you smiling and laughing as you make dinner is almost like a dream to Taehyung, and not one he ever truly believed he would get to see come to life. It\u2019s times like this that he remembers how terrified the two of you were when you got pregnant, and you thankful you both were when the company supported you the whole way,</p><p>\u201cLook at this! This looks so yummy,\u201d Taehyung drawls in an almost pantomime-like manner that makes his son collapse in a fit of giggle, \u201cI don\u2019t think I can wait for dinner, I\u2019m going to have to slurp it all up now!\u201d Taehyung continues, grabbing a fistful of the uncut dough and going to put it in his mouth when his son starts shrieking,</p><p>\u201cNo! Eomma says if you eat them now, you\u2019ll get all sick,\u201d He protests, and Taehyung\u2019s heart fills with twice as much love as before as he sets it back down and sweeps his son up into the air to put a smile back on his face. He really did inherit Taehyung\u2019s heart.</p><p><a href=\"https://taehyungiejiminie95.tumblr.com/post/164938184180/the-masterlist\">Masterlist</a></p>",

Like I know that he said one hyung told him that but it had to be someone he looked up to if he didn&rsquo;t even want to post the version with Adora (which was amazing &amp; she def didnt do anything wrong). The lyrics were amazing and he wanted to sing it with his best friend theres no problem with that. Like BTS are a group of 7 MEN and all their songs and duets sound amazing. Talking about duets between BTS members jikook have done a christmas song AND even covered &ldquo;we dont talk anymore&rdquo; a song sung by a MALE and a FEMALE and they still sounded AMAZING and guess what? THEY&rsquo;RE BOTH MEN. so why tf can&rsquo;t Tae do it? Kook and Chim already proved it doesn&rsquo;t matter the gender so let Tae do the same. And also it&rsquo;s jimin like if they want a higher voice JIMIN CAN DO THAT. That &ldquo;hyung&rdquo; is just being mean to Tae and he doesn&rsquo;t deserve it he&rsquo;s so talented but this person just had to say something to bring him down. I hope everyone supports Tae and compliments his song because that&rsquo;s just a horrible thing to be told when you wanna do something with someone you love and appreciate. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"564\" data-orig-width=\"594\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"cringemix:gKuVqcUED8ohb6UhgP8IBQ:ZaPYIt2boNaZY\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5dde5f229f889f00cc4fab72c717d2c5/tumblr_pewkwkBLy61s33r1xo1_640.gif\" data-orig-height=\"564\" data-orig-width=\"594\"/></figure>",

Talking about duets between BTS members jikook have done a christmas song AND even covered &ldquo;we dont talk anymore&rdquo; a song sung by a MALE and a FEMALE and they still sounded AMAZING and guess what? THEY&rsquo;RE BOTH MEN. so why tf can&rsquo;t Tae do it? Kook and Chim already proved it doesn&rsquo;t matter the gender so let Tae do the same. And also it&rsquo;s jimin like if they want a higher voice JIMIN CAN DO THAT. That &ldquo;hyung&rdquo; is just being mean to Tae and he doesn&rsquo;t deserve it he&rsquo;s so talented but this person just had to say something to bring him down. I hope everyone supports Tae and compliments his song because that&rsquo;s just a horrible thing to be told when you wanna do something with someone you love and appreciate. </p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure></p>",
