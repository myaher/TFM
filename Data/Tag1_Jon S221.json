Death in fiction can be an easy way out and therefore rather boring. And Jon being a Perfect Pure Hero who does nothing wrong and then sacrifices himself for the greater good would be uninspired and not feel very GRRM. And he\u2019s already been murdered once, so that would bring nothing new to the table either\u2013especially not if it\u2019s someone who betrays him.

Especially considering that she didn\u2019t do that to the Hound. If they want a tear-jerker, that would be a good way of doing it. I still doubt it, though. I find it really odd to make him the\u00a0\u201crightful\u201d heir to the Iron Throne for the sole purpose of being a rival to D/ny and then kill him off. It has to lead somewhere or he could\u2019ve just been Ned Stark\u2019s bastard.</p><p>But say Jon dies. If he dies,\u00a0I think he\u2019ll stay dead. They\u2019ve already done the death + resurrection bit and, unless you\u2019re doing it for a good reason, it\u2019s a cop-out. So repeating it would be nothing but cheap. It weakens any emotional punch the death had and is, frankly, insulting to the audience and characters. It\u2019s not something I think GRRM would do. And while D&amp;D aren\u2019t fantastic writers, I also don\u2019t think they\u2019re cowards. They like inflicting pain on the audience, so if they have a choice, I don\u2019t think they\u2019d pull a second resurrection either.</p><p>The saying you mention is something GRRM is fond of, though, as far as I understand it. But I think it\u2019ll feature in different ways. Like, perhaps a third trial for Tyrion, a third marriage for Sansa, or a third fire for Dany etc.</p><p>Thanks for the ask!</p>",

                "content_raw": "<p>Hello!</p><p>I\u2019m not really following? As far as I know, Jon has only died once. So either you mean that he\u2019ll die again, get resurrected, and die a third time in s8. Or that he has a third <i>life</i> after dying the second time? Or am I missing something lol?</p><p>Either way, no, I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll die again. S8 will most likely have him doing some dishonorable stuff and he should have to live with those consequences and come to terms with what he\u2019s done and the choices he\u2019s made. Death in fiction can be an easy way out and therefore rather boring. And Jon being a Perfect Pure Hero who does nothing wrong and then sacrifices himself for the greater good would be uninspired and not feel very GRRM. And he\u2019s already been murdered once, so that would bring nothing new to the table either\u2013especially not if it\u2019s someone who betrays him. And Jon being injured in the war and dying afterwards seems unnecessary to me, because why drag that out?</p><p>In a convo I had the other day, someone suggested a mercy killing (if you see this, I\u2019ll add your name if you want), where Arya would put Jon out of his misery and I can see the sense in that. Especially considering that she didn\u2019t do that to the Hound. If they want a tear-jerker, that would be a good way of doing it. I still doubt it, though. I find it really odd to make him the\u00a0\u201crightful\u201d heir to the Iron Throne for the sole purpose of being a rival to D/ny and then kill him off. It has to lead somewhere or he could\u2019ve just been Ned Stark\u2019s bastard.</p><p>But say Jon dies. If he dies,\u00a0I think he\u2019ll stay dead. They\u2019ve already done the death + resurrection bit and, unless you\u2019re doing it for a good reason, it\u2019s a cop-out. So repeating it would be nothing but cheap. It weakens any emotional punch the death had and is, frankly, insulting to the audience and characters. It\u2019s not something I think GRRM would do. And while D&amp;D aren\u2019t fantastic writers, I also don\u2019t think they\u2019re cowards. They like inflicting pain on the audience, so if they have a choice, I don\u2019t think they\u2019d pull a second resurrection either.</p><p>The saying you mention is something GRRM is fond of, though, as far as I understand it. But I think it\u2019ll feature in different ways. Like, perhaps a third trial for Tyrion, a third marriage for Sansa, or a third fire for Dany etc.</p><p>Thanks for the ask!</p>",

        "question": "I'm wondering why you think Jon's going to reconnect with his Stark 'siblings' instead the more likely path of him embracing his heritage as a Targaryen (dragon riding, Dany, fulfilling Rhaegar's prophecy)? Given that Jon gets killed for being trying to be a Stark (he reminisces about those siblings before he dies), Aemon's warnings about killing the boy and letting the man be born. Isn't him coming into his own as a Targaryen Prince much more thematically foreshadowed?",
        "answer": "<p>Simple - I don\u2019t agree that it\u2019s more likely Jon embraces his Targaryen heritage over his Stark heritage, and I don\u2019t agree that this is more heavily thematically foreshadowed. Quite the reverse. I don\u2019t see why Jon\u2019s murder would cause him to reject the Stark family, and I read\u00a0\u201ckill the boy and let the man be born\u201d as a comment on Jon\u2019s maturity rather than his family identity.</p><p>Jon is established right at the beginning of the story as a member of the Stark family, even though he is somewhat set apart from them. He\u2019s subject to the party scattering that the rest of the family is, and so he\u2019ll be drawn back to Winterfell with the rest of his siblings. We see again and again and <i>again</i>\u00a0through his story just how much he loves his siblings, and so I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll drop them like rocks because he found a shinier heritage. It\u2019s a point of note regarding his bastardy that one of the things he hates about it is how it makes him not truly a part of the <i>Stark</i>\u00a0family.\u00a0</p><p>We also know that Jon is proud of being Ned\u2019s son. The reveal that Rhaegar\u2019s his bio-dad, and the realisation of everything that came from Rhaegar\u2019s desire to have <i>Jon</i>\u00a0is not the sort of thing this character can celebrate. Jon grew up knowing how reluctant Ned was to speak of Jon\u2019s mother; he can work out just how much grief <b>all of Westeros</b>\u00a0went through for Rhaegar\u2019s prophetic vision. I think it\u2019s far more likely that Jon is horrified and rejects said vision.</p><p>If Jon fulfils Rhaegar\u2019s prophecy, I doubt it has anything to do with Rhaegar, and everything to do with what Ned taught him was the right thing to do.</p>",
