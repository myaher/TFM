        "body": "<p>One of my favourite Arya chapters in the entire series this week.</p><p><b>The story so far\u2026</b></p><p>A girl is under instructions to forget Arya of House Stark and temporarily become Cat of the Canals in order to advance her training in the House of Black and White.</p><!-- more --><p><b>A Tour of Braavos</b></p><p>We\u2019ve been in Braavos for a few chapters, but in this chapter, our PoV character walks around Braavos as the Braavosi do, with the express intention of experiencing the city as its citizens do. It\u2019s a sunny day in Braavos, and it\u2019s not hard to see how much Arya\u2019s enjoying her current situation.</p><p>Braavos has the <i>best</i> backstory. When GRRM says he could have written an entire book of Arya in Braavos, I don\u2019t doubt it for a second.</p><blockquote><p>Braavos was a city made for secrets, a city of fogs and masks and whispers. Its very existence had been a secret for a century, the girl had learned; its location had been hidden thrice that long. \u201cThe Nine Free Cities are the daughters of Valyria that was,\u201d the kindly man taught her, \u201cbut Braavos is the bastard child who ran away from home. We are a mongrel folk, the sons of slaves and whores and thieves. Our forebears came from half a hundred lands to this place of refuge, to escape the dragonlords who had enslaved them.[\u201d]</p></blockquote><p>A secret city of runaway slaves, slowly building itself up into a greater power. Braavos is therefore a multicultural place. Temples to just about every god can be found in the city. Even the Faceless Men are a religious organisation, devout followers of the Many-Faced God.</p><p>And so the start of the chapter is Cat waking up, getting ready for work, and commuting to the fishmarket. Through this, we get to know Braavos. The commute and the daily routine make for some dense worldbuilding. We learn Braavos\u2019 normal weather (wet and cold). We pass the Palace of Truth and the towers of the wealthiest families (and we\u2019re <i>so</i> in a Renaissance setting here), we pass the Silty Town and the aqueducts, until we get to the fishmarket.</p><blockquote><p>By the time Brusco and his sons tied up by the fishmarket, it was swarming with herring sellers and cod wives, oystermen, clam diggers, stewards, cooks, smallwives, and sailors off the galleys, all haggling loudly with one another as they inspected the morning catch.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Just look at this. Aside from the image of a crowded market, this is just the fishmarket, and there\u2019s such a range in profession here, just in this one little market. There are distinctions between cod wives and herring sellers and clam diggers. And all the consumers, all these people wanting fish. Some thought went into the urban social geography here. From the fishmarket where Brusco buys the catch and divides it up between his daughters and Arya for re-sale, we follow Arya on her day. While Brusco\u2019s daughter Brea visits the Purple Harbour where the Braavosi sailors dock, and Brusco\u2019s other daughter Talea sells her wares around the Moon Pool and the temples, Arya heads to the Ragman\u2019s Harbour, where foreigners dock.</p><blockquote><p>Cat liked it best of any place in Braavos.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>What Cat likes is the sheer human <i>variety</i> of the place. This helps build Braavos as a setting, too. People from all over come to Braavos to trade. There\u2019s a trade tongue, a jumble of various languages. There\u2019s the Chequy Port and the Drowned Town \u201cwhose sunken domes and towers poked up from the green waters of the lagoon,\u201d so <i>cool</i>. We see Braavosi bureaucrats - their customs officers, keyholders, and justiciars. When Westerosi sailors ask Arya for recommendations as to entertainment, she can tell them three different options (four if you count the brothel).</p><p>There\u2019s still a good deal of darkness to the setting. In a note of how thoroughly sex and violence are still interwoven in Arya\u2019s life, she can say with accuracy which sex workers are best - and which are likely to assault, rob, or murder their patrons. Even in the brothel Arya recommends as the best, the madam employs a worker of fourteen, and charges three times as much for her services. Nor is this an especially unusual situation, judging by the Sailor\u2019s Wife, who apparently married the first time at fourteen as well. Injury is catastrophic, and disability is a real worry, as we see with the story of Little Narbo (who lost three fingers when attacked by one of the sex workers mentioned earlier).</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWhat will he do?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPull an oar, he says. Two fingers are enough for that, he thinks, and the Sealord\u2019s always looking for more oarsmen. I tell him, \u2018Narbo, no. That sea is colder than a maiden and crueler than a whore. Better you should cut off the hand, and beg.\u2019[\u201d]</p></blockquote><p>On the other end of the spectrum, Arya\u2019s even met a courtesan, one of Braavos\u2019 celebrity sex workers. They\u2019re definitely celebrities, with a level of social status that demands that Cat of the Canals not speak to them unless spoken to.</p><blockquote><p>The courtesans of Braavos were famed across the world. Singers sang of them, goldsmiths and jewelers showered them with gifts, craftsmen begged for the honor of their custom, merchant princes paid royal ransoms to have them on their arms at balls and feasts and mummer shows, and bravos slew each other in their names.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>These women have developed public personas:</p><blockquote><p>The Poetess always had a book to hand, the Moonshadow wore only white and silver, and the Merling Queen was never seen without her Mermaids, four young maidens in the blush of their first flowering who held her train and did her hair.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>In many ways Arya\u2019s an ideal character for getting to know a setting, since she\u2019s interested in the whole of the world around her. She likes talking to people and getting to know their lives, and a chapter in which she\u2019s given free rein to do just that is a chapter in which we can learn a lot about her setting very quickly. She is, however, very focused on the little people of that setting, and her knowledge of broader Braavosi politics is limited. This isn\u2019t a bad thing, not in the slightest, but it gives her a different focus to her sister, whose own training montage is designed around those greater scope politics and a different social class. Both of them contrast to Bran, who\u2019s focusing on the magical and the even longer term. They\u2019re all needed.</p><p><b>Training Montage</b></p><p>Underneath this ordinary day in Braavos is assassin training. The House of Black and White requires her to touch base with them monthly, serving in the temple three days out of thirty. Arya is no one, then, and she does the jobs of an acolyte, washing corpses, taking their possessions into custody, working in the kitchens. The rest of the time, she\u2019s out in the city.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cLearn three new things before you come back to us,\u201d the kindly man had commanded Cat, when he sent her forth into the city. She always did.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>At present, the House of Black and White aren\u2019t fussy about what things Arya learns. Language, gossip, trade secrets. The important thing is that she listens and learns from a variety of sources, and practices getting new, reliable information. And so, when Arya comes back with a report like this:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI know what Blind Beqqo puts in the hot sauce he uses on his oysters,\u201d she would say. \u201cI know the mummers at the Blue Lantern are going to do The Lord of the Woeful Countenance and the mummers at the Ship mean to answer with Seven Drunken Oarsmen. I know the bookseller Lotho Lornel sleeps in the house of Tradesman-Captain Moredo Prestayn whenever the honorable tradesman-captain is away on a voyage, and moves out whenever the Vixen comes home.\u201d\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>That\u2019s good! Not only does it teach her how to get information, the content of what she learns can be used to help her and others build convincing covers for infiltration. She\u2019s also taught to distinguish between pure information and analysis.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cQuence and Alaquo had a fight and left the Ship, but I think that they\u2019ll come back.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cDo you only think, or do you know?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI only think,\u201d she had to confess, even though she was certain of it.</p></blockquote><p>We see the process she must go through when she returns to the House of Black and White, too, and it involves first divesting herself of the identity she\u2019s assumed.</p><blockquote><p>Down in the vaults, she untied Cat\u2019s threadbare cloak, pulled Cat\u2019s fishy brown tunic over her head, kicked off Cat\u2019s salt-stained boots, climbed out of Cat\u2019s smallclothes, and bathed in lemonwater to wash away the very smell of Cat of the Canals. When she emerged, soaped and scrubbed pink with her brown hair plastered to her cheeks, Cat was gone.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Subsequently, we see her take a few lessons. One in poisons, as she helps fetch ingredients and generally prepare. She\u2019s disciplined when she displays one of Arya Stark\u2019s facial tics, and promptly given another lesson in lying. Note that her teachers explain things to her and give her a structure for her learning.</p><blockquote><p>She raised her hand to her cheek, more surprised than hurt. \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIt is Arya of House Stark who chews on her lip whenever she is thinking. Are you Arya of House Stark?\u201d<br/></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Arya considered her warily. \u201cIs that true?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThere is truth in it.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAnd lies as well?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThere is an untruth, and an exaggeration.\u201d<br/></p></blockquote><p>They give her the tools she needs to eventually succeed in those lessons. Unlike the show, they don\u2019t just hit her with a goddamned stick and expect her to absorb information somehow.</p><p>Finally, we see the Faceless Men deal with a serious disciplinary infraction on Arya\u2019s part. They have in her an apprentice who murdered someone not for the God\u2019s reasons, but for her own.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThat girl? I thought she had left Braavos. Who are you?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNo one.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou lie.\u201d\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>As a result, they change her training, giving her a drink that robs her of her sight. There the chapter leaves off, where it\u2019s apparent that Arya\u2019s training has been changed up.</p><p><b>Arya of House Stark</b></p><p>There is no forgetting that this is an Arya chapter, however. Even at the start of the chapter, as Cat wakes up, she\u2019s woken from Arya\u2019s dreams.</p><blockquote><p>I should not be dreaming wolf dreams, the girl told herself. I am a cat now, not a wolf. I am Cat of the Canals. The wolf dreams belonged to Arya of House Stark. Try as she might, though, she could not rid herself of Arya. It made no difference whether she slept beneath the temple or in the little room beneath the eaves with Brusco\u2019s daughters, the wolf dreams still haunted her by night&hellip; and sometimes other dreams as well.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>This doesn\u2019t just involve Arya\u2019s cool warg powers. Arya desperately wants to be Cat because Arya <i>hurts</i>. The wolf dreams are the good ones, involving pack and power. The bad dreams\u2026</p><blockquote><p>In that one she was always looking for her mother, stumbling through a wasted land of mud and blood and fire. It was always raining in that dream, and she could hear her mother screaming, but a monster with a dog\u2019s head would not let her go save her.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>They\u2019re traumatic.</p><p>So Arya involves herself in a different role. The fact that she\u2019s method acting as best she can is apparent to the kindly man. When he asks her \u201cwho are you?\u201d the first time in the chapter:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cNo one.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou lie. You are Cat of the canals, I know you well.[\u201d]</p></blockquote><p>Arya enjoys the role she\u2019s playing, an orphan girl with a simple job, living amongst a family again. She likes living in Braavos and meeting the people who travel there. There\u2019s no angst associated with it. Indeed, the sheer joy she finds in making friends and learning new things is a bittersweet highlight of this chapter.</p><blockquote><p>Cat had made friends along the wharves; porters and mummers, ropemakers and sailmenders, taverners, brewers and bakers and beggars and whores. They bought clams and cockles from her, told her true tales of Braavos and lies about their lives, and laughed at the way she talked when she tried to speak Braavosi. She never let that trouble her. Instead, she showed them all the fig, and told them they were camel cunts, which made them roar with laughter.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Even one of the omnipresent threats of sexual violence Arya\u2019s faced ends as happily as it might, with Arya being defended from the threat rather than having to deal with it herself, and a predator getting fish-slapped. She\u2019s come a long way from the girl who fled King\u2019s Landing, who didn\u2019t know about threats of sexual violence at all and didn\u2019t really know how to handle living as a common person in a city.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cOysters, clams, and cockles\u201d were Cat\u2019s magic words, and like all good magic words they could take her almost anywhere.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>There\u2019s magic in her life again. No wonder Arya likes this role so much. But what makes it so bittersweet is that it was never meant to last, not even if she <i>could</i>\u00a0become no one, and Arya cannot stop being Arya. Not even when she\u2019s thoroughly enjoying herself.</p><blockquote><p>The biggest toms would seldom win, she noticed; oft as not, the prize went to some smaller, quicker animal, thin and mean and hungry. Like me, she told herself. Her favorite was a scrawny old tom with a chewed ear who reminded her of a cat that she\u2019d once chased all around the Red Keep. No, that was some other girl, not me.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Nor can she resist asking about Lysa Arryn when she meets Westerosi sailors from the Vale, out of her familial connections.</p><blockquote><p>The lady of the Vale was her own mother\u2019s sister. \u201cLady Lysa,\u201d she said, \u201cis she&hellip; ?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201c&hellip; dead?\u201d finished the freckled boy whose head was full of courtesans. \u201cAye. Murdered by her own singer.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d It\u2019s nought to me. Cat of the Canals never had an aunt. She never did.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Ask about Arya\u2019s family first, think about the role she\u2019s supposed to play later. This is the first of two occasions in the chapter where the reader knows Arya\u2019s so <i>close</i>\u00a0to better information about her siblings, but has no real way to access that step further and get that information - even if Arya should learn about Littlefinger and his\u00a0\u201cbastard daughter,\u201d she has no reason to associate Alayne Stone with Sansa, and even if Arya had been in the Happy Port the night that Sam hit Dareon, Sam said nothing about Jon Snow.</p><p>But it\u2019s the end-of-chapter setpiece that makes it crystal clear that it\u2019s still Arya of House Stark narrating the chapter.</p><blockquote><p>It made her angry to see Dareon sitting there so brazen, making eyes at Lanna as his fingers danced across the harp strings.\u00a0</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>He is a man of the Night\u2019s Watch, she thought, as he sang about some stupid lady throwing herself off some stupid tower because her stupid prince was dead. The lady should go kill the ones who killed her prince. And the singer should be on the Wall. When Dareon had first appeared at the Happy Port, Arya had almost asked if he would take her with him back to Eastwatch, until she heard him telling Bethany that he was never going back.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>What\u2019s Night\u2019s Watch tradition to Cat of the Canals? How did Cat of the Canals learn this conviction? No. That\u2019s all Arya, daughter of Eddard Stark. This man is flaunting his desertion. As far as she\u2019s concerned he has no right to the money he makes. It also angers her that Dareon strings along multiple women. When she leaves the Happy Port with him after selling her wares, his brazenness continues.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cEvery time I play the Eel I come away with silver,\u201d he boasted, \u201cand some nights there are captains there, and owners.\u201d They crossed a little bridge, and made their way down a crooked back street as the shadows of the day grew longer. \u201cSoon I will be playing in the Purple, and after that the Sealord\u2019s Palace,\u201d Dareon went on. Cat\u2019s empty barrow clattered over the cobblestones, making its own sort of rattling music. \u201cYesterday I ate herring with the whores, but within the year I\u2019ll be having emperor crab with courtesans.\u201d\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Arya asks what became of Sam, and the response Dareon gives her brims with compassion.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWe all were. Lord Snow\u2019s command. I told Sam, leave the old man, but the fat fool would not listen.\u201d The last light of the setting sun shone in his hair. \u201cWell, it\u2019s too late now.\u201d\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Arya does not associate \u2018Lord Snow\u2019 with Jon; I don\u2019t believe she knows that Dareon\u2019s referring to her brother here. There\u2019s a cut away here, but if the sun going down on Dareon as they step into an alley doesn\u2019t tip you off, the boots Arya gives to Brusco certainly should. Considerate of her, really. Good boots are hard to find.</p><p>At the end of the chapter, she confesses this murder to the kindly man, and is open about who committed it.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWho could have done this thing, I wonder?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cArya of House Stark.\u201d<br/></p></blockquote><p>So we see that as hard as she tries, she cannot leave Arya behind. Even if Arya wants to forget her pain, she can\u2019t manage to forget her sense of justice.</p><p><b>Chapter Function</b></p><p>This chapter is so very important to Arya\u2019s character development. After three books of nonstop trauma, she has structure and a reasonable amount of safety. She has friends, and outside of that, time spent with a variety of people on a regular basis. Her time as Cat of the Canals is a vitally important breather for her. Related - it also allows her to quietly recover those things that make her <i>Arya</i>, unbeknownst to the Faceless Men. This is Arya Underfoot, underfoot to a whole city. She\u2019s using her mother\u2019s nickname. Is it really any surprise, by the end of the chapter, that she enacts her father\u2019s justice on a Watch deserter?</p><p>The incident with Dareon sets up the conflict that will eventually drive her to leave the Faceless Men and Braavos. Arya is not no one. She cannot be no one, not while she retains that deeply-rooted sense of what is <i>right</i>. Sooner or later, her sense of morality will compel her to return to being Arya Stark. On top of that, we see that she has persistent wolf dreams, she thinks of her relatives and still wishes to return to Westeros, and cannot entirely shake the trauma that drove her to the Faceless Men in the first place.</p><p>This also serves as part of a training montage for Arya. She\u2019s picking up skills fast - including learning how to learn. She\u2019ll need those skills later, and most likely, other people will need her to have those skills too.</p><p><b>Miscellany</b></p><p>One of the rumours Arya learns in the course of her training is a rumour of dragons hatching.</p><p>While Arya is in the Ragman\u2019s Harbour, she hears that Sallador Saan is back to piracy.</p><p>Fourteen-year-old blond Lanna, who works in the Happy Port brothel, could well be of Lannister blood, you\u2019d think.</p><p>Arya\u2019s poison lesson gives us a big hint as to something going on over in Sansa\u2019s storyline: the sweetsleep prescribed to help calm Sweetrobin\u2019s seizures is used by the Faceless Men as a poison.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cA few grains will slow a pounding heart and stop a hand from shaking, and make a man feel calm and strong. A pinch will grant a night of deep and dreamless sleep. Three pinches will produce that sleep that does not end.[\u201d]</p></blockquote><p>Arya knows this now. The reader knows this. Sansa remains clueless just how dangerous it is.</p><p><b>Clothing Porn</b></p><p>Dareon wears a plush purple cloak lined with vair, a tunic striped in white and lilac, and parti-coloured bravo breeches. Arya mentions that he has other fancy cloaks as well, one silk, one burgundy velvet lined with cloth-of-gold.</p><p><b>Food Porn</b></p><p>Oysters and hot sauce, and oysters, bread and vinegar. Hope you like oysters.</p><p><b>Next Three Chapters</b></p><p>The Griffin Reborn, ADWD - Dany X, ADWD - Davos IV, ASoS</p><p>Thanks to everyone who\u2019s sent in chapter requests so far!</p>",

While Brusco\u2019s daughter Brea visits the Purple Harbour where the Braavosi sailors dock, and Brusco\u2019s other daughter Talea sells her wares around the Moon Pool and the temples, Arya heads to the Ragman\u2019s Harbour, where foreigners dock.</p><blockquote><p>Cat liked it best of any place in Braavos.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>What Cat likes is the sheer human <i>variety</i> of the place. This helps build Braavos as a setting, too. People from all over come to Braavos to trade. There\u2019s a trade tongue, a jumble of various languages. There\u2019s the Chequy Port and the Drowned Town \u201cwhose sunken domes and towers poked up from the green waters of the lagoon,\u201d so <i>cool</i>. We see Braavosi bureaucrats - their customs officers, keyholders, and justiciars. When Westerosi sailors ask Arya for recommendations as to entertainment, she can tell them three different options (four if you count the brothel).</p><p>There\u2019s still a good deal of darkness to the setting. In a note of how thoroughly sex and violence are still interwoven in Arya\u2019s life, she can say with accuracy which sex workers are best - and which are likely to assault, rob, or murder their patrons. Even in the brothel Arya recommends as the best, the madam employs a worker of fourteen, and charges three times as much for her services. Nor is this an especially unusual situation, judging by the Sailor\u2019s Wife, who apparently married the first time at fourteen as well. Injury is catastrophic, and disability is a real worry, as we see with the story of Little Narbo (who lost three fingers when attacked by one of the sex workers mentioned earlier).</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWhat will he do?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPull an oar, he says. Two fingers are enough for that, he thinks, and the Sealord\u2019s always looking for more oarsmen. I tell him, \u2018Narbo, no. That sea is colder than a maiden and crueler than a whore. Better you should cut off the hand, and beg.\u2019[\u201d]</p></blockquote><p>On the other end of the spectrum, Arya\u2019s even met a courtesan, one of Braavos\u2019 celebrity sex workers. They\u2019re definitely celebrities, with a level of social status that demands that Cat of the Canals not speak to them unless spoken to.</p><blockquote><p>The courtesans of Braavos were famed across the world. Singers sang of them, goldsmiths and jewelers showered them with gifts, craftsmen begged for the honor of their custom, merchant princes paid royal ransoms to have them on their arms at balls and feasts and mummer shows, and bravos slew each other in their names.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>These women have developed public personas:</p><blockquote><p>The Poetess always had a book to hand, the Moonshadow wore only white and silver, and the Merling Queen was never seen without her Mermaids, four young maidens in the blush of their first flowering who held her train and did her hair.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>In many ways Arya\u2019s an ideal character for getting to know a setting, since she\u2019s interested in the whole of the world around her. She likes talking to people and getting to know their lives, and a chapter in which she\u2019s given free rein to do just that is a chapter in which we can learn a lot about her setting very quickly. She is, however, very focused on the little people of that setting, and her knowledge of broader Braavosi politics is limited. This isn\u2019t a bad thing, not in the slightest, but it gives her a different focus to her sister, whose own training montage is designed around those greater scope politics and a different social class. Both of them contrast to Bran, who\u2019s focusing on the magical and the even longer term. They\u2019re all needed.</p><p><b>Training Montage</b></p><p>Underneath this ordinary day in Braavos is assassin training. The House of Black and White requires her to touch base with them monthly, serving in the temple three days out of thirty. Arya is no one, then, and she does the jobs of an acolyte, washing corpses, taking their possessions into custody, working in the kitchens. The rest of the time, she\u2019s out in the city.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cLearn three new things before you come back to us,\u201d the kindly man had commanded Cat, when he sent her forth into the city. She always did.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>At present, the House of Black and White aren\u2019t fussy about what things Arya learns. Language, gossip, trade secrets. The important thing is that she listens and learns from a variety of sources, and practices getting new, reliable information. And so, when Arya comes back with a report like this:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI know what Blind Beqqo puts in the hot sauce he uses on his oysters,\u201d she would say. \u201cI know the mummers at the Blue Lantern are going to do The Lord of the Woeful Countenance and the mummers at the Ship mean to answer with Seven Drunken Oarsmen. I know the bookseller Lotho Lornel sleeps in the house of Tradesman-Captain Moredo Prestayn whenever the honorable tradesman-captain is away on a voyage, and moves out whenever the Vixen comes home.\u201d\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>That\u2019s good! Not only does it teach her how to get information, the content of what she learns can be used to help her and others build convincing covers for infiltration. She\u2019s also taught to distinguish between pure information and analysis.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cQuence and Alaquo had a fight and left the Ship, but I think that they\u2019ll come back.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDo you only think, or do you know?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI only think,\u201d she had to confess, even though she was certain of it.</p></blockquote><p>We see the process she must go through when she returns to the House of Black and White, too, and it involves first divesting herself of the identity she\u2019s assumed.</p><blockquote><p>Down in the vaults, she untied Cat\u2019s threadbare cloak, pulled Cat\u2019s fishy brown tunic over her head, kicked off Cat\u2019s salt-stained boots, climbed out of Cat\u2019s smallclothes, and bathed in lemonwater to wash away the very smell of Cat of the Canals. When she emerged, soaped and scrubbed pink with her brown hair plastered to her cheeks, Cat was gone.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Subsequently, we see her take a few lessons. One in poisons, as she helps fetch ingredients and generally prepare. She\u2019s disciplined when she displays one of Arya Stark\u2019s facial tics, and promptly given another lesson in lying. Note that her teachers explain things to her and give her a structure for her learning.</p><blockquote><p>She raised her hand to her cheek, more surprised than hurt. \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIt is Arya of House Stark who chews on her lip whenever she is thinking. Are you Arya of House Stark?\u201d<br></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Arya considered her warily. \u201cIs that true?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThere is truth in it.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAnd lies as well?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThere is an untruth, and an exaggeration.\u201d<br></p></blockquote><p>They give her the tools she needs to eventually succeed in those lessons. Unlike the show, they don\u2019t just hit her with a goddamned stick and expect her to absorb information somehow.</p><p>Finally, we see the Faceless Men deal with a serious disciplinary infraction on Arya\u2019s part. They have in her an apprentice who murdered someone not for the God\u2019s reasons, but for her own.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThat girl? I thought she had left Braavos. Who are you?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNo one.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou lie.\u201d\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>As a result, they change her training, giving her a drink that robs her of her sight. There the chapter leaves off, where it\u2019s apparent that Arya\u2019s training has been changed up.</p><p><b>Arya of House Stark</b></p><p>There is no forgetting that this is an Arya chapter, however. Even at the start of the chapter, as Cat wakes up, she\u2019s woken from Arya\u2019s dreams.</p><blockquote><p>I should not be dreaming wolf dreams, the girl told herself. I am a cat now, not a wolf. I am Cat of the Canals. The wolf dreams belonged to Arya of House Stark. Try as she might, though, she could not rid herself of Arya. It made no difference whether she slept beneath the temple or in the little room beneath the eaves with Brusco\u2019s daughters, the wolf dreams still haunted her by night\u2026 and sometimes other dreams as well.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>This doesn\u2019t just involve Arya\u2019s cool warg powers. Arya desperately wants to be Cat because Arya <i>hurts</i>. The wolf dreams are the good ones, involving pack and power. The bad dreams\u2026</p><blockquote><p>In that one she was always looking for her mother, stumbling through a wasted land of mud and blood and fire. It was always raining in that dream, and she could hear her mother screaming, but a monster with a dog\u2019s head would not let her go save her.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>They\u2019re traumatic.</p><p>So Arya involves herself in a different role. The fact that she\u2019s method acting as best she can is apparent to the kindly man. When he asks her \u201cwho are you?\u201d the first time in the chapter:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cNo one.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou lie. You are Cat of the canals, I know you well.[\u201d]</p></blockquote><p>Arya enjoys the role she\u2019s playing, an orphan girl with a simple job, living amongst a family again. She likes living in Braavos and meeting the people who travel there. There\u2019s no angst associated with it. Indeed, the sheer joy she finds in making friends and learning new things is a bittersweet highlight of this chapter.</p><blockquote><p>Cat had made friends along the wharves; porters and mummers, ropemakers and sailmenders, taverners, brewers and bakers and beggars and whores. They bought clams and cockles from her, told her true tales of Braavos and lies about their lives, and laughed at the way she talked when she tried to speak Braavosi. She never let that trouble her. Instead, she showed them all the fig, and told them they were camel cunts, which made them roar with laughter.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Even one of the omnipresent threats of sexual violence Arya\u2019s faced ends as happily as it might, with Arya being defended from the threat rather than having to deal with it herself, and a predator getting fish-slapped. She\u2019s come a long way from the girl who fled King\u2019s Landing, who didn\u2019t know about threats of sexual violence at all and didn\u2019t really know how to handle living as a common person in a city.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cOysters, clams, and cockles\u201d were Cat\u2019s magic words, and like all good magic words they could take her almost anywhere.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>There\u2019s magic in her life again. No wonder Arya likes this role so much. But what makes it so bittersweet is that it was never meant to last, not even if she <i>could</i>\u00a0become no one, and Arya cannot stop being Arya. Not even when she\u2019s thoroughly enjoying herself.</p><blockquote><p>The biggest toms would seldom win, she noticed; oft as not, the prize went to some smaller, quicker animal, thin and mean and hungry. Like me, she told herself. Her favorite was a scrawny old tom with a chewed ear who reminded her of a cat that she\u2019d once chased all around the Red Keep. No, that was some other girl, not me.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Nor can she resist asking about Lysa Arryn when she meets Westerosi sailors from the Vale, out of her familial connections.</p><blockquote><p>The lady of the Vale was her own mother\u2019s sister. \u201cLady Lysa,\u201d she said, \u201cis she\u2026 ?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201c\u2026 dead?\u201d finished the freckled boy whose head was full of courtesans. \u201cAye. Murdered by her own singer.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d It\u2019s nought to me. Cat of the Canals never had an aunt. She never did.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Ask about Arya\u2019s family first, think about the role she\u2019s supposed to play later. This is the first of two occasions in the chapter where the reader knows Arya\u2019s so <i>close</i>\u00a0to better information about her siblings, but has no real way to access that step further and get that information - even if Arya should learn about Littlefinger and his\u00a0\u201cbastard daughter,\u201d she has no reason to associate Alayne Stone with Sansa, and even if Arya had been in the Happy Port the night that Sam hit Dareon, Sam said nothing about Jon Snow.</p><p>But it\u2019s the end-of-chapter setpiece that makes it crystal clear that it\u2019s still Arya of House Stark narrating the chapter.</p><blockquote><p>It made her angry to see Dareon sitting there so brazen, making eyes at Lanna as his fingers danced across the harp strings.\u00a0</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>He is a man of the Night\u2019s Watch, she thought, as he sang about some stupid lady throwing herself off some stupid tower because her stupid prince was dead. The lady should go kill the ones who killed her prince. And the singer should be on the Wall. When Dareon had first appeared at the Happy Port, Arya had almost asked if he would take her with him back to Eastwatch, until she heard him telling Bethany that he was never going back.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>What\u2019s Night\u2019s Watch tradition to Cat of the Canals? How did Cat of the Canals learn this conviction? No. That\u2019s all Arya, daughter of Eddard Stark. This man is flaunting his desertion. As far as she\u2019s concerned he has no right to the money he makes. It also angers her that Dareon strings along multiple women. When she leaves the Happy Port with him after selling her wares, his brazenness continues.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cEvery time I play the Eel I come away with silver,\u201d he boasted, \u201cand some nights there are captains there, and owners.\u201d They crossed a little bridge, and made their way down a crooked back street as the shadows of the day grew longer. \u201cSoon I will be playing in the Purple, and after that the Sealord\u2019s Palace,\u201d Dareon went on. Cat\u2019s empty barrow clattered over the cobblestones, making its own sort of rattling music. \u201cYesterday I ate herring with the whores, but within the year I\u2019ll be having emperor crab with courtesans.\u201d\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Arya asks what became of Sam, and the response Dareon gives her brims with compassion.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWe all were. Lord Snow\u2019s command. I told Sam, leave the old man, but the fat fool would not listen.\u201d The last light of the setting sun shone in his hair. \u201cWell, it\u2019s too late now.\u201d\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Arya does not associate \u2018Lord Snow\u2019 with Jon; I don\u2019t believe she knows that Dareon\u2019s referring to her brother here. There\u2019s a cut away here, but if the sun going down on Dareon as they step into an alley doesn\u2019t tip you off, the boots Arya gives to Brusco certainly should. Considerate of her, really. Good boots are hard to find.</p><p>At the end of the chapter, she confesses this murder to the kindly man, and is open about who committed it.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWho could have done this thing, I wonder?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cArya of House Stark.\u201d<br></p></blockquote><p>So we see that as hard as she tries, she cannot leave Arya behind. Even if Arya wants to forget her pain, she can\u2019t manage to forget her sense of justice.</p><p><b>Chapter Function</b></p><p>This chapter is so very important to Arya\u2019s character development. After three books of nonstop trauma, she has structure and a reasonable amount of safety. She has friends, and outside of that, time spent with a variety of people on a regular basis. Her time as Cat of the Canals is a vitally important breather for her. Related - it also allows her to quietly recover those things that make her <i>Arya</i>, unbeknownst to the Faceless Men. This is Arya Underfoot, underfoot to a whole city. She\u2019s using her mother\u2019s nickname. Is it really any surprise, by the end of the chapter, that she enacts her father\u2019s justice on a Watch deserter?</p><p>The incident with Dareon sets up the conflict that will eventually drive her to leave the Faceless Men and Braavos. Arya is not no one. She cannot be no one, not while she retains that deeply-rooted sense of what is <i>right</i>. Sooner or later, her sense of morality will compel her to return to being Arya Stark. On top of that, we see that she has persistent wolf dreams, she thinks of her relatives and still wishes to return to Westeros, and cannot entirely shake the trauma that drove her to the Faceless Men in the first place.</p><p>This also serves as part of a training montage for Arya. She\u2019s picking up skills fast - including learning how to learn. She\u2019ll need those skills later, and most likely, other people will need her to have those skills too.</p><p><b>Miscellany</b></p><p>One of the rumours Arya learns in the course of her training is a rumour of dragons hatching.</p><p>While Arya is in the Ragman\u2019s Harbour, she hears that Sallador Saan is back to piracy.</p><p>Fourteen-year-old blond Lanna, who works in the Happy Port brothel, could well be of Lannister blood, you\u2019d think.</p><p>Arya\u2019s poison lesson gives us a big hint as to something going on over in Sansa\u2019s storyline: the sweetsleep prescribed to help calm Sweetrobin\u2019s seizures is used by the Faceless Men as a poison.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cA few grains will slow a pounding heart and stop a hand from shaking, and make a man feel calm and strong. A pinch will grant a night of deep and dreamless sleep. Three pinches will produce that sleep that does not end.[\u201d]</p></blockquote><p>Arya knows this now. The reader knows this. Sansa remains clueless just how dangerous it is.</p><p><b>Clothing Porn</b></p><p>Dareon wears a plush purple cloak lined with vair, a tunic striped in white and lilac, and parti-coloured bravo breeches. Arya mentions that he has other fancy cloaks as well, one silk, one burgundy velvet lined with cloth-of-gold.</p><p><b>Food Porn</b></p><p>Oysters and hot sauce, and oysters, bread and vinegar. Hope you like oysters.</p><p><b>Next Three Chapters</b></p><p>The Griffin Reborn, ADWD - Dany X, ADWD - Davos IV, ASoS</p><p>Thanks to everyone who\u2019s sent in chapter requests so far!</p>",

It\u2019s a sunny day in Braavos, and it\u2019s not hard to see how much Arya\u2019s enjoying her current situation.</p><p>Braavos has the <i>best</i> backstory. When GRRM says he could have written an entire book of Arya in Braavos, I don\u2019t doubt it for a second.</p><blockquote><p>Braavos was a city made for secrets, a city of fogs and masks and whispers. Its very existence had been a secret for a century, the girl had learned; its location had been hidden thrice that long. \u201cThe Nine Free Cities are the daughters of Valyria that was,\u201d the kindly man taught her, \u201cbut Braavos is the bastard child who ran away from home. We are a mongrel folk, the sons of slaves and whores and thieves. Our forebears came from half a hundred lands to this place of refuge, to escape the dragonlords who had enslaved them.[\u201d]</p></blockquote><p>A secret city of runaway slaves, slowly building itself up into a greater power. Braavos is therefore a multicultural place. Temples to just about every god can be found in the city. Even the Faceless Men are a religious organisation, devout followers of the Many-Faced God.</p><p>And so the start of the chapter is Cat waking up, getting ready for work, and commuting to the fishmarket. Through this, we get to know Braavos. The commute and the daily routine make for some dense worldbuilding. We learn Braavos\u2019 normal weather (wet and cold). We pass the Palace of Truth and the towers of the wealthiest families (and we\u2019re <i>so</i> in a Renaissance setting here), we pass the Silty Town and the aqueducts, until we get to the fishmarket.</p><blockquote><p>By the time Brusco and his sons tied up by the fishmarket, it was swarming with herring sellers and cod wives, oystermen, clam diggers, stewards, cooks, smallwives, and sailors off the galleys, all haggling loudly with one another as they inspected the morning catch.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Just look at this. Aside from the image of a crowded market, this is just the fishmarket, and there\u2019s such a range in profession here, just in this one little market. There are distinctions between cod wives and herring sellers and clam diggers. And all the consumers, all these people wanting fish. Some thought went into the urban social geography here. From the fishmarket where Brusco buys the catch and divides it up between his daughters and Arya for re-sale, we follow Arya on her day. While Brusco\u2019s daughter Brea visits the Purple Harbour where the Braavosi sailors dock, and Brusco\u2019s other daughter Talea sells her wares around the Moon Pool and the temples, Arya heads to the Ragman\u2019s Harbour, where foreigners dock.</p><blockquote><p>Cat liked it best of any place in Braavos.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>What Cat likes is the sheer human <i>variety</i> of the place. This helps build Braavos as a setting, too. People from all over come to Braavos to trade. There\u2019s a trade tongue, a jumble of various languages. There\u2019s the Chequy Port and the Drowned Town \u201cwhose sunken domes and towers poked up from the green waters of the lagoon,\u201d so <i>cool</i>. We see Braavosi bureaucrats - their customs officers, keyholders, and justiciars. When Westerosi sailors ask Arya for recommendations as to entertainment, she can tell them three different options (four if you count the brothel).</p><p>There\u2019s still a good deal of darkness to the setting. In a note of how thoroughly sex and violence are still interwoven in Arya\u2019s life, she can say with accuracy which sex workers are best - and which are likely to assault, rob, or murder their patrons. Even in the brothel Arya recommends as the best, the madam employs a worker of fourteen, and charges three times as much for her services. Nor is this an especially unusual situation, judging by the Sailor\u2019s Wife, who apparently married the first time at fourteen as well. Injury is catastrophic, and disability is a real worry, as we see with the story of Little Narbo (who lost three fingers when attacked by one of the sex workers mentioned earlier).</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWhat will he do?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPull an oar, he says. Two fingers are enough for that, he thinks, and the Sealord\u2019s always looking for more oarsmen. I tell him, \u2018Narbo, no. That sea is colder than a maiden and crueler than a whore. Better you should cut off the hand, and beg.\u2019[\u201d]</p></blockquote><p>On the other end of the spectrum, Arya\u2019s even met a courtesan, one of Braavos\u2019 celebrity sex workers. They\u2019re definitely celebrities, with a level of social status that demands that Cat of the Canals not speak to them unless spoken to.</p><blockquote><p>The courtesans of Braavos were famed across the world. Singers sang of them, goldsmiths and jewelers showered them with gifts, craftsmen begged for the honor of their custom, merchant princes paid royal ransoms to have them on their arms at balls and feasts and mummer shows, and bravos slew each other in their names.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>These women have developed public personas:</p><blockquote><p>The Poetess always had a book to hand, the Moonshadow wore only white and silver, and the Merling Queen was never seen without her Mermaids, four young maidens in the blush of their first flowering who held her train and did her hair.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>In many ways Arya\u2019s an ideal character for getting to know a setting, since she\u2019s interested in the whole of the world around her. She likes talking to people and getting to know their lives, and a chapter in which she\u2019s given free rein to do just that is a chapter in which we can learn a lot about her setting very quickly. She is, however, very focused on the little people of that setting, and her knowledge of broader Braavosi politics is limited. This isn\u2019t a bad thing, not in the slightest, but it gives her a different focus to her sister, whose own training montage is designed around those greater scope politics and a different social class. Both of them contrast to Bran, who\u2019s focusing on the magical and the even longer term. They\u2019re all needed.</p><p><b>Training Montage</b></p><p>Underneath this ordinary day in Braavos is assassin training. The House of Black and White requires her to touch base with them monthly, serving in the temple three days out of thirty. Arya is no one, then, and she does the jobs of an acolyte, washing corpses, taking their possessions into custody, working in the kitchens. The rest of the time, she\u2019s out in the city.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cLearn three new things before you come back to us,\u201d the kindly man had commanded Cat, when he sent her forth into the city. She always did.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>At present, the House of Black and White aren\u2019t fussy about what things Arya learns. Language, gossip, trade secrets. The important thing is that she listens and learns from a variety of sources, and practices getting new, reliable information. And so, when Arya comes back with a report like this:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI know what Blind Beqqo puts in the hot sauce he uses on his oysters,\u201d she would say. \u201cI know the mummers at the Blue Lantern are going to do The Lord of the Woeful Countenance and the mummers at the Ship mean to answer with Seven Drunken Oarsmen. I know the bookseller Lotho Lornel sleeps in the house of Tradesman-Captain Moredo Prestayn whenever the honorable tradesman-captain is away on a voyage, and moves out whenever the Vixen comes home.\u201d\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>That\u2019s good! Not only does it teach her how to get information, the content of what she learns can be used to help her and others build convincing covers for infiltration. She\u2019s also taught to distinguish between pure information and analysis.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cQuence and Alaquo had a fight and left the Ship, but I think that they\u2019ll come back.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDo you only think, or do you know?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI only think,\u201d she had to confess, even though she was certain of it.</p></blockquote><p>We see the process she must go through when she returns to the House of Black and White, too, and it involves first divesting herself of the identity she\u2019s assumed.</p><blockquote><p>Down in the vaults, she untied Cat\u2019s threadbare cloak, pulled Cat\u2019s fishy brown tunic over her head, kicked off Cat\u2019s salt-stained boots, climbed out of Cat\u2019s smallclothes, and bathed in lemonwater to wash away the very smell of Cat of the Canals. When she emerged, soaped and scrubbed pink with her brown hair plastered to her cheeks, Cat was gone.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Subsequently, we see her take a few lessons. One in poisons, as she helps fetch ingredients and generally prepare. She\u2019s disciplined when she displays one of Arya Stark\u2019s facial tics, and promptly given another lesson in lying. Note that her teachers explain things to her and give her a structure for her learning.</p><blockquote><p>She raised her hand to her cheek, more surprised than hurt. \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIt is Arya of House Stark who chews on her lip whenever she is thinking. Are you Arya of House Stark?\u201d<br></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Arya considered her warily. \u201cIs that true?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThere is truth in it.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAnd lies as well?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThere is an untruth, and an exaggeration.\u201d<br></p></blockquote><p>They give her the tools she needs to eventually succeed in those lessons. Unlike the show, they don\u2019t just hit her with a goddamned stick and expect her to absorb information somehow.</p><p>Finally, we see the Faceless Men deal with a serious disciplinary infraction on Arya\u2019s part. They have in her an apprentice who murdered someone not for the God\u2019s reasons, but for her own.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThat girl? I thought she had left Braavos. Who are you?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNo one.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou lie.\u201d\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>As a result, they change her training, giving her a drink that robs her of her sight. There the chapter leaves off, where it\u2019s apparent that Arya\u2019s training has been changed up.</p><p><b>Arya of House Stark</b></p><p>There is no forgetting that this is an Arya chapter, however. Even at the start of the chapter, as Cat wakes up, she\u2019s woken from Arya\u2019s dreams.</p><blockquote><p>I should not be dreaming wolf dreams, the girl told herself. I am a cat now, not a wolf. I am Cat of the Canals. The wolf dreams belonged to Arya of House Stark. Try as she might, though, she could not rid herself of Arya. It made no difference whether she slept beneath the temple or in the little room beneath the eaves with Brusco\u2019s daughters, the wolf dreams still haunted her by night\u2026 and sometimes other dreams as well.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>This doesn\u2019t just involve Arya\u2019s cool warg powers. Arya desperately wants to be Cat because Arya <i>hurts</i>. The wolf dreams are the good ones, involving pack and power. The bad dreams\u2026</p><blockquote><p>In that one she was always looking for her mother, stumbling through a wasted land of mud and blood and fire. It was always raining in that dream, and she could hear her mother screaming, but a monster with a dog\u2019s head would not let her go save her.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>They\u2019re traumatic.</p><p>So Arya involves herself in a different role. The fact that she\u2019s method acting as best she can is apparent to the kindly man. When he asks her \u201cwho are you?\u201d the first time in the chapter:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cNo one.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou lie. You are Cat of the canals, I know you well.[\u201d]</p></blockquote><p>Arya enjoys the role she\u2019s playing, an orphan girl with a simple job, living amongst a family again. She likes living in Braavos and meeting the people who travel there. There\u2019s no angst associated with it. Indeed, the sheer joy she finds in making friends and learning new things is a bittersweet highlight of this chapter.</p><blockquote><p>Cat had made friends along the wharves; porters and mummers, ropemakers and sailmenders, taverners, brewers and bakers and beggars and whores. They bought clams and cockles from her, told her true tales of Braavos and lies about their lives, and laughed at the way she talked when she tried to speak Braavosi. She never let that trouble her. Instead, she showed them all the fig, and told them they were camel cunts, which made them roar with laughter.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Even one of the omnipresent threats of sexual violence Arya\u2019s faced ends as happily as it might, with Arya being defended from the threat rather than having to deal with it herself, and a predator getting fish-slapped. She\u2019s come a long way from the girl who fled King\u2019s Landing, who didn\u2019t know about threats of sexual violence at all and didn\u2019t really know how to handle living as a common person in a city.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cOysters, clams, and cockles\u201d were Cat\u2019s magic words, and like all good magic words they could take her almost anywhere.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>There\u2019s magic in her life again. No wonder Arya likes this role so much. But what makes it so bittersweet is that it was never meant to last, not even if she <i>could</i>\u00a0become no one, and Arya cannot stop being Arya. Not even when she\u2019s thoroughly enjoying herself.</p><blockquote><p>The biggest toms would seldom win, she noticed; oft as not, the prize went to some smaller, quicker animal, thin and mean and hungry. Like me, she told herself. Her favorite was a scrawny old tom with a chewed ear who reminded her of a cat that she\u2019d once chased all around the Red Keep. No, that was some other girl, not me.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Nor can she resist asking about Lysa Arryn when she meets Westerosi sailors from the Vale, out of her familial connections.</p><blockquote><p>The lady of the Vale was her own mother\u2019s sister. \u201cLady Lysa,\u201d she said, \u201cis she\u2026 ?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201c\u2026 dead?\u201d finished the freckled boy whose head was full of courtesans. \u201cAye. Murdered by her own singer.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d It\u2019s nought to me. Cat of the Canals never had an aunt. She never did.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Ask about Arya\u2019s family first, think about the role she\u2019s supposed to play later. This is the first of two occasions in the chapter where the reader knows Arya\u2019s so <i>close</i>\u00a0to better information about her siblings, but has no real way to access that step further and get that information - even if Arya should learn about Littlefinger and his\u00a0\u201cbastard daughter,\u201d she has no reason to associate Alayne Stone with Sansa, and even if Arya had been in the Happy Port the night that Sam hit Dareon, Sam said nothing about Jon Snow.</p><p>But it\u2019s the end-of-chapter setpiece that makes it crystal clear that it\u2019s still Arya of House Stark narrating the chapter.</p><blockquote><p>It made her angry to see Dareon sitting there so brazen, making eyes at Lanna as his fingers danced across the harp strings.\u00a0</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>He is a man of the Night\u2019s Watch, she thought, as he sang about some stupid lady throwing herself off some stupid tower because her stupid prince was dead. The lady should go kill the ones who killed her prince. And the singer should be on the Wall. When Dareon had first appeared at the Happy Port, Arya had almost asked if he would take her with him back to Eastwatch, until she heard him telling Bethany that he was never going back.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>What\u2019s Night\u2019s Watch tradition to Cat of the Canals? How did Cat of the Canals learn this conviction? No. That\u2019s all Arya, daughter of Eddard Stark. This man is flaunting his desertion. As far as she\u2019s concerned he has no right to the money he makes. It also angers her that Dareon strings along multiple women. When she leaves the Happy Port with him after selling her wares, his brazenness continues.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cEvery time I play the Eel I come away with silver,\u201d he boasted, \u201cand some nights there are captains there, and owners.\u201d They crossed a little bridge, and made their way down a crooked back street as the shadows of the day grew longer. \u201cSoon I will be playing in the Purple, and after that the Sealord\u2019s Palace,\u201d Dareon went on. Cat\u2019s empty barrow clattered over the cobblestones, making its own sort of rattling music. \u201cYesterday I ate herring with the whores, but within the year I\u2019ll be having emperor crab with courtesans.\u201d\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Arya asks what became of Sam, and the response Dareon gives her brims with compassion.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWe all were. Lord Snow\u2019s command. I told Sam, leave the old man, but the fat fool would not listen.\u201d The last light of the setting sun shone in his hair. \u201cWell, it\u2019s too late now.\u201d\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Arya does not associate \u2018Lord Snow\u2019 with Jon; I don\u2019t believe she knows that Dareon\u2019s referring to her brother here. There\u2019s a cut away here, but if the sun going down on Dareon as they step into an alley doesn\u2019t tip you off, the boots Arya gives to Brusco certainly should. Considerate of her, really. Good boots are hard to find.</p><p>At the end of the chapter, she confesses this murder to the kindly man, and is open about who committed it.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWho could have done this thing, I wonder?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cArya of House Stark.\u201d<br></p></blockquote><p>So we see that as hard as she tries, she cannot leave Arya behind. Even if Arya wants to forget her pain, she can\u2019t manage to forget her sense of justice.</p><p><b>Chapter Function</b></p><p>This chapter is so very important to Arya\u2019s character development. After three books of nonstop trauma, she has structure and a reasonable amount of safety. She has friends, and outside of that, time spent with a variety of people on a regular basis. Her time as Cat of the Canals is a vitally important breather for her. Related - it also allows her to quietly recover those things that make her <i>Arya</i>, unbeknownst to the Faceless Men. This is Arya Underfoot, underfoot to a whole city. She\u2019s using her mother\u2019s nickname. Is it really any surprise, by the end of the chapter, that she enacts her father\u2019s justice on a Watch deserter?</p><p>The incident with Dareon sets up the conflict that will eventually drive her to leave the Faceless Men and Braavos. Arya is not no one. She cannot be no one, not while she retains that deeply-rooted sense of what is <i>right</i>. Sooner or later, her sense of morality will compel her to return to being Arya Stark. On top of that, we see that she has persistent wolf dreams, she thinks of her relatives and still wishes to return to Westeros, and cannot entirely shake the trauma that drove her to the Faceless Men in the first place.</p><p>This also serves as part of a training montage for Arya. She\u2019s picking up skills fast - including learning how to learn. She\u2019ll need those skills later, and most likely, other people will need her to have those skills too.</p><p><b>Miscellany</b></p><p>One of the rumours Arya learns in the course of her training is a rumour of dragons hatching.</p><p>While Arya is in the Ragman\u2019s Harbour, she hears that Sallador Saan is back to piracy.</p><p>Fourteen-year-old blond Lanna, who works in the Happy Port brothel, could well be of Lannister blood, you\u2019d think.</p><p>Arya\u2019s poison lesson gives us a big hint as to something going on over in Sansa\u2019s storyline: the sweetsleep prescribed to help calm Sweetrobin\u2019s seizures is used by the Faceless Men as a poison.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cA few grains will slow a pounding heart and stop a hand from shaking, and make a man feel calm and strong. A pinch will grant a night of deep and dreamless sleep. Three pinches will produce that sleep that does not end.[\u201d]</p></blockquote><p>Arya knows this now. The reader knows this. Sansa remains clueless just how dangerous it is.</p><p><b>Clothing Porn</b></p><p>Dareon wears a plush purple cloak lined with vair, a tunic striped in white and lilac, and parti-coloured bravo breeches. Arya mentions that he has other fancy cloaks as well, one silk, one burgundy velvet lined with cloth-of-gold.</p><p><b>Food Porn</b></p><p>Oysters and hot sauce, and oysters, bread and vinegar. Hope you like oysters.</p><p><b>Next Three Chapters</b></p><p>The Griffin Reborn, ADWD - Dany X, ADWD - Davos IV, ASoS</p><p>Thanks to everyone who\u2019s sent in chapter requests so far!</p>",
                "content": "<p>One of my favourite Arya chapters in the entire series this week.</p><p><b>The story so far&hellip;</b></p><p>A girl is under instructions to forget Arya of House Stark and temporarily become Cat of the Canals in order to advance her training in the House of Black and White.</p><p><b>A Tour of Braavos</b></p><p>We&rsquo;ve been in Braavos for a few chapters, but in this chapter, our PoV character walks around Braavos as the Braavosi do, with the express intention of experiencing the city as its citizens do. It&rsquo;s a sunny day in Braavos, and it&rsquo;s not hard to see how much Arya&rsquo;s enjoying her current situation.</p><p>Braavos has the <i>best</i> backstory. When GRRM says he could have written an entire book of Arya in Braavos, I don&rsquo;t doubt it for a second.</p><blockquote><p>Braavos was a city made for secrets, a city of fogs and masks and whispers. Its very existence had been a secret for a century, the girl had learned; its location had been hidden thrice that long. &ldquo;The Nine Free Cities are the daughters of Valyria that was,&rdquo; the kindly man taught her, &ldquo;but Braavos is the bastard child who ran away from home. We are a mongrel folk, the sons of slaves and whores and thieves. Our forebears came from half a hundred lands to this place of refuge, to escape the dragonlords who had enslaved them.[&rdquo;]</p></blockquote><p>A secret city of runaway slaves, slowly building itself up into a greater power. Braavos is therefore a multicultural place. Temples to just about every god can be found in the city. Even the Faceless Men are a religious organisation, devout followers of the Many-Faced God.</p><p>And so the start of the chapter is Cat waking up, getting ready for work, and commuting to the fishmarket. Through this, we get to know Braavos. The commute and the daily routine make for some dense worldbuilding. We learn Braavos&rsquo; normal weather (wet and cold). We pass the Palace of Truth and the towers of the wealthiest families (and we&rsquo;re <i>so</i> in a Renaissance setting here), we pass the Silty Town and the aqueducts, until we get to the fishmarket.</p><blockquote><p>By the time Brusco and his sons tied up by the fishmarket, it was swarming with herring sellers and cod wives, oystermen, clam diggers, stewards, cooks, smallwives, and sailors off the galleys, all haggling loudly with one another as they inspected the morning catch.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Just look at this. Aside from the image of a crowded market, this is just the fishmarket, and there&rsquo;s such a range in profession here, just in this one little market. There are distinctions between cod wives and herring sellers and clam diggers. And all the consumers, all these people wanting fish. Some thought went into the urban social geography here. From the fishmarket where Brusco buys the catch and divides it up between his daughters and Arya for re-sale, we follow Arya on her day. While Brusco&rsquo;s daughter Brea visits the Purple Harbour where the Braavosi sailors dock, and Brusco&rsquo;s other daughter Talea sells her wares around the Moon Pool and the temples, Arya heads to the Ragman&rsquo;s Harbour, where foreigners dock.</p><blockquote><p>Cat liked it best of any place in Braavos.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>What Cat likes is the sheer human <i>variety</i> of the place. This helps build Braavos as a setting, too. People from all over come to Braavos to trade. There&rsquo;s a trade tongue, a jumble of various languages. There&rsquo;s the Chequy Port and the Drowned Town &ldquo;whose sunken domes and towers poked up from the green waters of the lagoon,&rdquo; so <i>cool</i>. We see Braavosi bureaucrats - their customs officers, keyholders, and justiciars. When Westerosi sailors ask Arya for recommendations as to entertainment, she can tell them three different options (four if you count the brothel).</p><p>There&rsquo;s still a good deal of darkness to the setting. In a note of how thoroughly sex and violence are still interwoven in Arya&rsquo;s life, she can say with accuracy which sex workers are best - and which are likely to assault, rob, or murder their patrons. Even in the brothel Arya recommends as the best, the madam employs a worker of fourteen, and charges three times as much for her services. Nor is this an especially unusual situation, judging by the Sailor&rsquo;s Wife, who apparently married the first time at fourteen as well. Injury is catastrophic, and disability is a real worry, as we see with the story of Little Narbo (who lost three fingers when attacked by one of the sex workers mentioned earlier).</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;What will he do?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Pull an oar, he says. Two fingers are enough for that, he thinks, and the Sealord&rsquo;s always looking for more oarsmen. I tell him, &lsquo;Narbo, no. That sea is colder than a maiden and crueler than a whore. Better you should cut off the hand, and beg.&rsquo;[&rdquo;]</p></blockquote><p>On the other end of the spectrum, Arya&rsquo;s even met a courtesan, one of Braavos&rsquo; celebrity sex workers. They&rsquo;re definitely celebrities, with a level of social status that demands that Cat of the Canals not speak to them unless spoken to.</p><blockquote><p>The courtesans of Braavos were famed across the world. Singers sang of them, goldsmiths and jewelers showered them with gifts, craftsmen begged for the honor of their custom, merchant princes paid royal ransoms to have them on their arms at balls and feasts and mummer shows, and bravos slew each other in their names.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>These women have developed public personas:</p><blockquote><p>The Poetess always had a book to hand, the Moonshadow wore only white and silver, and the Merling Queen was never seen without her Mermaids, four young maidens in the blush of their first flowering who held her train and did her hair.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>In many ways Arya&rsquo;s an ideal character for getting to know a setting, since she&rsquo;s interested in the whole of the world around her. She likes talking to people and getting to know their lives, and a chapter in which she&rsquo;s given free rein to do just that is a chapter in which we can learn a lot about her setting very quickly. She is, however, very focused on the little people of that setting, and her knowledge of broader Braavosi politics is limited. This isn&rsquo;t a bad thing, not in the slightest, but it gives her a different focus to her sister, whose own training montage is designed around those greater scope politics and a different social class. Both of them contrast to Bran, who&rsquo;s focusing on the magical and the even longer term. They&rsquo;re all needed.</p><p><b>Training Montage</b></p><p>Underneath this ordinary day in Braavos is assassin training. The House of Black and White requires her to touch base with them monthly, serving in the temple three days out of thirty. Arya is no one, then, and she does the jobs of an acolyte, washing corpses, taking their possessions into custody, working in the kitchens. The rest of the time, she&rsquo;s out in the city.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Learn three new things before you come back to us,&rdquo; the kindly man had commanded Cat, when he sent her forth into the city. She always did.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>At present, the House of Black and White aren&rsquo;t fussy about what things Arya learns. Language, gossip, trade secrets. The important thing is that she listens and learns from a variety of sources, and practices getting new, reliable information. And so, when Arya comes back with a report like this:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I know what Blind Beqqo puts in the hot sauce he uses on his oysters,&rdquo; she would say. &ldquo;I know the mummers at the Blue Lantern are going to do The Lord of the Woeful Countenance and the mummers at the Ship mean to answer with Seven Drunken Oarsmen. I know the bookseller Lotho Lornel sleeps in the house of Tradesman-Captain Moredo Prestayn whenever the honorable tradesman-captain is away on a voyage, and moves out whenever the Vixen comes home.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>That&rsquo;s good!

Indeed, the sheer joy she finds in making friends and learning new things is a bittersweet highlight of this chapter.</p><blockquote><p>Cat had made friends along the wharves; porters and mummers, ropemakers and sailmenders, taverners, brewers and bakers and beggars and whores. They bought clams and cockles from her, told her true tales of Braavos and lies about their lives, and laughed at the way she talked when she tried to speak Braavosi. She never let that trouble her. Instead, she showed them all the fig, and told them they were camel cunts, which made them roar with laughter.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Even one of the omnipresent threats of sexual violence Arya&rsquo;s faced ends as happily as it might, with Arya being defended from the threat rather than having to deal with it herself, and a predator getting fish-slapped. She&rsquo;s come a long way from the girl who fled King&rsquo;s Landing, who didn&rsquo;t know about threats of sexual violence at all and didn&rsquo;t really know how to handle living as a common person in a city.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oysters, clams, and cockles&rdquo; were Cat&rsquo;s magic words, and like all good magic words they could take her almost anywhere.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>There&rsquo;s magic in her life again. No wonder Arya likes this role so much. But what makes it so bittersweet is that it was never meant to last, not even if she <i>could</i>&nbsp;become no one, and Arya cannot stop being Arya. Not even when she&rsquo;s thoroughly enjoying herself.</p><blockquote><p>The biggest toms would seldom win, she noticed; oft as not, the prize went to some smaller, quicker animal, thin and mean and hungry. Like me, she told herself. Her favorite was a scrawny old tom with a chewed ear who reminded her of a cat that she&rsquo;d once chased all around the Red Keep. No, that was some other girl, not me.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Nor can she resist asking about Lysa Arryn when she meets Westerosi sailors from the Vale, out of her familial connections.</p><blockquote><p>The lady of the Vale was her own mother&rsquo;s sister. &ldquo;Lady Lysa,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is she&hellip; ?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip; dead?&rdquo; finished the freckled boy whose head was full of courtesans. &ldquo;Aye. Murdered by her own singer.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s nought to me. Cat of the Canals never had an aunt. She never did.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Ask about Arya&rsquo;s family first, think about the role she&rsquo;s supposed to play later. This is the first of two occasions in the chapter where the reader knows Arya&rsquo;s so <i>close</i>&nbsp;to better information about her siblings, but has no real way to access that step further and get that information - even if Arya should learn about Littlefinger and his&nbsp;&ldquo;bastard daughter,&rdquo; she has no reason to associate Alayne Stone with Sansa, and even if Arya had been in the Happy Port the night that Sam hit Dareon, Sam said nothing about Jon Snow.</p><p>But it&rsquo;s the end-of-chapter setpiece that makes it crystal clear that it&rsquo;s still Arya of House Stark narrating the chapter.</p><blockquote><p>It made her angry to see Dareon sitting there so brazen, making eyes at Lanna as his fingers danced across the harp strings.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>He is a man of the Night&rsquo;s Watch, she thought, as he sang about some stupid lady throwing herself off some stupid tower because her stupid prince was dead. The lady should go kill the ones who killed her prince. And the singer should be on the Wall. When Dareon had first appeared at the Happy Port, Arya had almost asked if he would take her with him back to Eastwatch, until she heard him telling Bethany that he was never going back.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>What&rsquo;s Night&rsquo;s Watch tradition to Cat of the Canals? How did Cat of the Canals learn this conviction? No. That&rsquo;s all Arya, daughter of Eddard Stark. This man is flaunting his desertion. As far as she&rsquo;s concerned he has no right to the money he makes. It also angers her that Dareon strings along multiple women. When she leaves the Happy Port with him after selling her wares, his brazenness continues.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Every time I play the Eel I come away with silver,&rdquo; he boasted, &ldquo;and some nights there are captains there, and owners.&rdquo; They crossed a little bridge, and made their way down a crooked back street as the shadows of the day grew longer. &ldquo;Soon I will be playing in the Purple, and after that the Sealord&rsquo;s Palace,&rdquo; Dareon went on. Cat&rsquo;s empty barrow clattered over the cobblestones, making its own sort of rattling music. &ldquo;Yesterday I ate herring with the whores, but within the year I&rsquo;ll be having emperor crab with courtesans.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Arya asks what became of Sam, and the response Dareon gives her brims with compassion.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;We all were. Lord Snow&rsquo;s command. I told Sam, leave the old man, but the fat fool would not listen.&rdquo; The last light of the setting sun shone in his hair. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s too late now.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Arya does not associate &lsquo;Lord Snow&rsquo; with Jon; I don&rsquo;t believe she knows that Dareon&rsquo;s referring to her brother here. There&rsquo;s a cut away here, but if the sun going down on Dareon as they step into an alley doesn&rsquo;t tip you off, the boots Arya gives to Brusco certainly should. Considerate of her, really. Good boots are hard to find.</p><p>At the end of the chapter, she confesses this murder to the kindly man, and is open about who committed it.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Who could have done this thing, I wonder?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Arya of House Stark.&rdquo;<br /></p></blockquote><p>So we see that as hard as she tries, she cannot leave Arya behind. Even if Arya wants to forget her pain, she can&rsquo;t manage to forget her sense of justice.</p><p><b>Chapter Function</b></p><p>This chapter is so very important to Arya&rsquo;s character development. After three books of nonstop trauma, she has structure and a reasonable amount of safety. She has friends, and outside of that, time spent with a variety of people on a regular basis. Her time as Cat of the Canals is a vitally important breather for her. Related - it also allows her to quietly recover those things that make her <i>Arya</i>, unbeknownst to the Faceless Men. This is Arya Underfoot, underfoot to a whole city. She&rsquo;s using her mother&rsquo;s nickname. Is it really any surprise, by the end of the chapter, that she enacts her father&rsquo;s justice on a Watch deserter?</p><p>The incident with Dareon sets up the conflict that will eventually drive her to leave the Faceless Men and Braavos. Arya is not no one. She cannot be no one, not while she retains that deeply-rooted sense of what is <i>right</i>. Sooner or later, her sense of morality will compel her to return to being Arya Stark. On top of that, we see that she has persistent wolf dreams, she thinks of her relatives and still wishes to return to Westeros, and cannot entirely shake the trauma that drove her to the Faceless Men in the first place.</p><p>This also serves as part of a training montage for Arya. She&rsquo;s picking up skills fast - including learning how to learn. She&rsquo;ll need those skills later, and most likely, other people will need her to have those skills too.</p><p><b>Miscellany</b></p><p>One of the rumours Arya learns in the course of her training is a rumour of dragons hatching.</p><p>While Arya is in the Ragman&rsquo;s Harbour, she hears that Sallador Saan is back to piracy.</p><p>Fourteen-year-old blond Lanna, who works in the Happy Port brothel, could well be of Lannister blood, you&rsquo;d think.</p><p>Arya&rsquo;s poison lesson gives us a big hint as to something going on over in Sansa&rsquo;s storyline: the sweetsleep prescribed to help calm Sweetrobin&rsquo;s seizures is used by the Faceless Men as a poison.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;A few grains will slow a pounding heart and stop a hand from shaking, and make a man feel calm and strong. A pinch will grant a night of deep and dreamless sleep. Three pinches will produce that sleep that does not end.[&rdquo;]</p></blockquote><p>Arya knows this now. The reader knows this. Sansa remains clueless just how dangerous it is.</p><p><b>Clothing Porn</b></p><p>Dareon wears a plush purple cloak lined with vair, a tunic striped in white and lilac, and parti-coloured bravo breeches. Arya mentions that he has other fancy cloaks as well, one silk, one burgundy velvet lined with cloth-of-gold.</p><p><b>Food Porn</b></p><p>Oysters and hot sauce, and oysters, bread and vinegar. Hope you like oysters.</p><p><b>Next Three Chapters</b></p><p>The Griffin Reborn, ADWD - Dany X, ADWD - Davos IV, ASoS</p><p>Thanks to everyone who&rsquo;s sent in chapter requests so far!</p>",
