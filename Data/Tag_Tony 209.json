the world expected tony stark to be fun, young, and reckless, and so that\u2019s what he would be. he threw himself into the party scene, trying to forget, trying to escape. another shot. another girl. another wall. an iron facade to hide the chinks.</p><p><i>stark men are made of iron</i>, he insisted, as the scalpel carved into him, trying to distract himself. but then the knife sliced deeper and he couldn\u2019t hold back a scream, and not even iron was enough to stop the pain. the masked faces bared down on him and suddenly he wasn\u2019t made of iron anymore - instead he was less than human.</p><p><i>stark men are made of iron</i>, he cried, but it felt like a plea. the water kept pouring down, drowning him, choking him. not even iron could stop it. iron may be strong, but it is hopelessly heavy, and in the end it only sinks.</p><p><i>stark men are made of iron, </i>he whispered encouragingly to himself in a cave in afghanistan. just empty words with empty meaning, and yet they ignited something in him. he was an iron soul in an iron suit, and he was destined to survive, to fix things, to right his wrongs. he was made of iron, and for the first time he knew what that meant.</p><p><i>stark men are made of iron</i>, obsidiah taunted, repeating his father\u2019s memorable catchphrase, carving into tony\u2019s chest, and simultaneously stabbing him in the back. what he didn\u2019t say floated unspoken in the air between them, <i>but</i> <i>even iron can be disposed of.</i></p><p><i>stark men are made of iron</i>, he thought as he stepped onto the podium, the eyes of the entire world on him, cameras flashing and reporters poised. he glanced down at his prepped speech, trying to calm his nerves. the perfect cover up they had crafted for him, the perfect story. a lie. he opened his mouth to recite it but instead he found himself discarding the notecards, shedding the skin he always worn, reclaiming his title, his legacy.<i> I am iron man.</i></p><p><i>stark men are made of iron</i>, he chastised himself. it was meant to be encouraging, meant to remind him of everything he had done, to motivate himself. instead it fell flat, tasting bitter in his mouth and only serving to make him falter. was iron strong enough to hold the weight of the world? could iron handle the pressure? or would it bend? would it break?</p><p><i>stark men are made of iron,</i> he scolded. so he ignored the attacks of the press, on his decisions, on his character. the glares of his \u201cfriends\u201d, his fellow avengers, who didn\u2019t trust him. he didn\u2019t listen to the calls of <i>selfish, greedy, cold, uncaring. </i>he put on his sunglasses and pulled up his mask, indifferent and charismatic. he didn\u2019t let them see the sting. </p><p><i>stark men are made of iron</i>, he scoffed, and it felt like a joke. sounded like a bitter irony. because his father had been a stark man and he was crushed like aluminum. because he was a stark man, and yet he felt so weak. stark men aren\u2019t made of iron, instead they\u2019re cursed to feel as heavy as the dense metal, weighted down by iron expectations, but doomed to shatter as easily as glass.</p><p><i>stark men are made of iron</i>, reverberated in the air. no one said it but it echoed all the same. they were all thinking it. <i>grow up tony. get it together. don\u2019t be weak. </i>it wasn\u2019t just a tag line, it was an expectation. he was a hero, he needed to act like one. who cared that his hands shook, or that he woke up screaming, or that he craved whiskey like it was the only thing that could save him? who cared if he didn\u2019t think he handle handle the weight of the guilt any longer? the pain of destruction and death and lives lost? <i>put your feelings aside tony, be a hero. be iron. </i>and so he was.</p><p><i>stark men are made of iron</i>, he thought bitterly as steve\u2019s shield slammed against his chest, <i>isn\u2019t that burden enough? </i>iron is meant to withstand anything, the attack of a blade or the bullet of a gun, but somehow betrayal seeped through the cracks of his armor. the attack of a shield, a defensive instrument, meant to protect rather than harm, was somehow infinitely more painful than the attack of any other weapon. some part of tony couldn\u2019t help but wonder if he deserved it, and the rest of him screamed that he did.</p><p><i>stark men are made of iron,</i> he said to himself, oh-so-tiredly, after taking peter\u2019s suit. peter would have to learn. he had endangered other people, and tony just didn\u2019t want him to be led the wrong way. tony wanted him to be <i>better</i>. but then he faltered. peter wasn\u2019t a stark man. he was just a boy. he already had a heart of gold, wasn\u2019t that already better than a soul of iron? he felt a pang in his chest, <i>was he doing the right thing?</i></p><p><i>stark men are made of iron</i>, he reflected warily, staring thanos down. but there are some things not even iron can withstand. destiny had led him down this path, given him an iron soul and titanium armor, and told him to face off against a titan. was it enough? an iron soul against a stone heart. only when the blade plunged through his body, piercing his core, did he realize iron never could\u2019ve been enough.</p><p>a snap. </p><p>(iron and stone and gold alike all crumble.)</p><p><i>stark men are made of iron</i>, he chanted internally, numb in disbelief, as a boy with a heart of gold fell forward, begging to be saved. <i>you\u2019re alright</i>. the words were as heavy as his heart. they fell flat. he met the eyes of his kid and watched as he turned to dust. </p><p><i>stark men are made of iron</i>, he mourned. <i>but even iron can fall apart.</i> his soul was leaden, with grief, guilt, sorrow. as heavy as iron, but without any of the strength. dense and hard and cold, just empty barren weight. </p><p><i>stark men are made of iron.</i></p><p>the phrase had followed him his whole life, but he wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to be made of iron anymore. for the first time it didn\u2019t sound like something to aspire to. for iron, in the end, had been as useless and fallible as anything else. it hadn\u2019t served to protect him. he didn\u2019t want to be cold and hard and sharp anymore. he wanted to feel. even if it killed him.</p><p>the iron walls he had been building since birth turned to dust with peter, leaving behind only raw emotion. raw pain. </p><p>at his core he wasn\u2019t made of iron, or gold, or even stone.</p><p>he was only human. </p><p>a grieving parent, with an iron soul and golden armor, who was chosen by the universe. a man armed with brains, but driven by his heart, destined to fight until the very end. a simple man. a noble hero.</p><p>in the end he was made of iron because he chose to be. </p><p>not because he was a stark. not because the world demanded it of him. not because he was expected to be. </p><p>in the end he was made of iron because he reached into the depths of his soul and drew strength from his core to save his kid.</p><p>he chose to how to define himself, he decided what his identity was - he was iron man.</p>",

I love you, but I also love her.\u201d</i> </p><p>She\nnodded wordlessly and walked out of their shared room at the tower. She didn\u2019t\nsay anything because there was nothing to say. What could one reply to that?\nShe didn\u2019t hate him. No, she loved him too much for that. She was just\ndisappointed and hurt. Three years of her life, three of the happiest years\nwere spent with a man who she thought loved her and only her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The broken-hearted girl walked\naimlessly around the great city of New York. The place was full of life and\nbright, but to her it was the exact opposite. Dull and lifeless. She finally\nbroke down on a bench at an abandon park. It was hidden from the rest of the\ncity, and due to the rustiness of the swings and the bench she could tell that\nit was old. She sat there with tears running down her face as she sat there\nstaring into nothing. </p><p>Steve sat\non the couch crying. He didn\u2019t know what to do. For the first time since the serum life, he was lost. He loves you, but he also loves Peggy. It hurt so much to see her\nin so much pain but he was so happy to see his first love whom he thought was\ngone. </p><p>He jumped\nwhen the front door swing open and in walked the rest of his team. They all\nlooked guilty, all but one. Bruce. He was angry. All he knew was that something was wrong. That Y/N was hurting. He doesn\u2019t know how, he could just feel it. He just knew something was wrong and it had to do with Captain America himself. It took all his self-control to\nnot let the Other Guy out but he was tempted to just so he could beat Steve to\na pulp. He would\u2019ve but his main concern was to find the woman whom he has come\nto adore and call his younger sister. He didn\u2019t spare a look at the crying man\nand walked around the apartment looking for her.</p><p>\u201cY/N! Y/N!\u201d he kept yelling as he frantically looks for her. He made his way back to\nthe living room. \u201cWhere is she?!\u201d</p><p>Steve\nlooked up at the fuming man. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the\nhell do you mean you don\u2019t know?!\u201d he screamed as the green guy started to come\nthrough. <i>The Other </i>guy isn\u2019t the most\nintelligent but he adored Y/N as much as Bruce did. She was the only one to\ncalm him down and wasn\u2019t afraid to be close to him and he was furious to know\nthat she was gone.</p><p>\u201cShe just\nwalked out. She-she\u2026 I lost her.\u201d </p><!-- more --><p>\u201cWhat the\nhell do you mean you lost her?\u201d he looked at his team members for backup only\nto see the same guilty look had adorned their faces too. \u201cWhat the hell did you\nguys do?\u201d he asked, voice barely above a whisper. He was afraid of the answer.\nIt was at that moment that a woman walked in that the blood had drained his\nface. \u201cP-Peggy? Wh-what are you&hellip; No. Hell no!\u201d he turned to Steve. \u201cYou piece\nof sh\u2014\u201d he didn\u2019t get to finish as the <i>Other\nGuy </i>broke through. Bruce grew incredibly taller and green. He started for\nthe man on the couch. Everyone reacted in seconds trying to calm down the green\nguy but he was too far gone. He smashed everything and everyone in his path. He\nhad gotten to Steve and started pummeling the blonde man.</p><p>\u201cBruce!\u201d a\nvoice screamed from the doorway and he stopped immediately and turned to her. </p><p>\u201cY/N/N?\u201d the\noverly green guy asked. </p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s\nY/N/N.\u201d She replied as she took a step forward and was stopped by voices of\nconcern from the others in the room. She disregarded them quickly and walked\ntowards the Hulk. \u201cCome on big boy. Let Bruce come back so I can talk to him\nyeah?\u201d she asked softly as she laid a hand on his big green ones. His eyes\nsoftened and he nodded. Within seconds Bruce stood where the green guy was.</p><p>\u201cY/N/N.\u201d He\ncried and hugged her. He was relieved that she was back. </p><p>Their\nmoment was broken when Peggy spoke up. \u201cSteve? Are you alright.\u201d </p><p>She turned\nto see Steve, and it wasn\u2019t a pretty sight. He was bloodied and bruised. She\nwatched as Peggy ran over to him and he gave her a smile as well as he could\nand she felt her heart shatter again. She looked at the rest of the team and\nshe felt betrayed. They all knew of Steve\u2019s infidelity and didn\u2019t want to tell her. All except Bruce. She looked at the people\nshe thought of as family, the people she loved and trusted with her life. Guess\nthey didn\u2019t regard her as the same. She silently walked to her room, along with\nBruce, and gathered all her belongings. She had stuffed them into a suitcase.\nShe looked at the dresser and saw the picture of them on the day he proposed to\nher. They had bright smiles on their faces and their eyes spoke volumes of love\nthey held for the other. <i>Where did I go\nwrong?</i> She took off the ring and placed it next to the picture and\ncontinued out the room.</p><p>As she\nwalked towards the front door she was met with the team. They looked down at\nthe suitcase and panicked. </p><p>\u201cY/N\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014\u201d </p><p>\u201cBaby.\u201d</p><p>The last\none caught her attention. She turned to him. He was healed, not all the way but\ngood enough due to the late Stark&rsquo;s creation.</p><p>\u201cI have\nwhat I need. You can throw the rest away. The ring is on the dresser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nyours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was when\nyou meant the words you said when you gave it to me. Goodbye.\u201d With that she\nwalked out, Bruce following quietly. He shook his head shamefully at his team. </p><p>He\nwalked her to the front door and talked with her. He had insisted that he go\nwith her, but she denied saying that he was needed here. That he had work he\nneeded to finish, and how he couldn\u2019t save the world if he came to her. It took\na great amount of persuasion and time to convince him but she did it. He didn\u2019t\nwant to, hell he hated the thought of it but she was right. As much as he hated\nthe people he once thought of as family he knew that he was needed here. With\none last tight tearful hug and a promise to keep in touch, he let her go. He\nknew she needed to heal from it all.</p><p>He walked\ninto the room to see his team. He studied each one of them. Nat sat with her\nhead in her hands shoulders shaking lightly. Clint had stray tears on his cheek\nas he stared at the wall. Thor was silently looking out the window. Tony was\ndrinking from his bar. Steve was holding Peggy\u2019s hand as she sat next to him.\nHe would\u2019ve felt sympathy for them, but he didn\u2019t. He just stared with them\nwith anger showing.</p><p>\u201cOh, stop\nwith the self-pity. You guys did this, especially you Rogers. You knew that she\nloves you. You knew that she doesn\u2019t trusted easily and yet she trusted you the\nmost. Don\u2019t sit there and cry to try to make yourselves feel better. Everyone\nsees you guys as heroes but you know what I see? I see a group of\ncowardly, pathetic, untrustworthy, selfish people.\u201d He stated and then walked\ntowards his lab. \u201cI truly hope you are happy together.\u201d He spoke to the couple on\nthe couch. </p><p>They\nflinched at his words but knew they he was right. They were selfish for keeping\nthis from her, but Steve felt the enormity of his words. He truly was a coward.\nA selfish, cheating coward. </p><hr><p>They stood\nstunned as they saw the news. They couldn\u2019t believe it. She was dead. They\nlistened to the news and cried quietly. It has been two months since it all\nhappened and everything hasn\u2019t been the same. The laughter was gone. Light no\nlonger shone into the tower. No one ate dinner together anymore. Movie night,\ntaco Tuesday, everything was gone. Missions and briefing was the only\ninteractions they had anymore. As for Peggy and Steve, they tried to make it\nwork. After-all, this all happened because of them two. They tried but Steve\nwas wrong about it all. And that is what made him regret it more. He gave up\ntrue love for the memory of love. He thought he had loved Peggy but he soon\nfound out that he loved the memories he had with her. They broke up not long\nafter.</p><p>\u201cToday we\nmourn. Earth has just lost one of her greatest defenders. The body of Y/N King\nwas found in her apartment in Las Vegas, Nevada earlier this morning. She was\nfound by room service at 8 AM this morning. It is rumored that she committed suicide,\nbut the officers are still invest&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>The\nnewscaster\u2019s voice was drowned out. They couldn\u2019t bare to listen. Someone once asked, \u201cHow do you lose someone twice?\u201d This is how. Steve got up silently and walked\nto his room. He blamed himself for it all. If he had trusted his heart, she\nwould still be here. Hell, they would\u2019ve been married by now. </p><p>He\nclosed the door to his room and walked to the bed they once shared. He couldn\u2019t\nsleep in it after\u00a0 Y/N left, so he shared another room with Peggy. He walked over\nto the side Y/N usually slept on and laid down. He hugged her pillow tightly\nto his chest as he gripped the picture of them together on their engagement\nparty. He screamed and cried hours upon hours. He wanted the pain to end. He\nfell asleep whispering her name and endless \u2018I love you\u2019s\u2019.</p><p>Bruce\nwas on the other side of the building trying to calm himself. He desperately\ndidn\u2019t want to believe that his little sister was gone. He screamed and cried.\nJust as the other guy was about to come out his phone rang. </p><hr><p>The\nAvengers were captured and held in cells adjacent from one another. They were\ncaptured on a mission gone wrong due to a rat within their HQ. They screamed\nand tried to break through the bars but they were all secured in there. </p><p>The mighty\nheroes were silenced as a tall burly man walked in banging a stick against the\nbars as he walked. </p><p>\u201cIt is\ntruly great to see you all. I have to say, I thought it would\u2019ve been harder to\ncapture <i>Earth\u2019s greatest defenders</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew\nyou!\u201d Tony yelled from his cell and he was met with agreements from Clint who\nwas on his left. </p><p>\u201cNo thank\nyou.\u201d He walked to Natalie. \u201cHello love. It\u2019s been too damn lo\u2014\u201d</p><p>He was\ninterrupted by a voice that sounded from the dark corner. \u201cHas anyone told you\nthat you talk too damn much Gertrude?\u201d She chuckled at the name. \u201cGertrude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are\nyou and how the hell did you get in here?\u201d he questioned loudly and he\nfrantically pressed the distress button. They all waited but no one came. </p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m\ninsulted that you don\u2019t know me. As for how I got in here, gas does wonders\nwhen released in the vents.\u201d</p><p>She walked\nunder the lights and all who were present gasped. </p><p>\u201cYou son\nof a bi\u2014\u201d he yelled as he attacked her. He was half way in the air when his\nbody dropped on the ground. Blood seeping from the bullet lodged in his\nforehead. Y/N sighed disappointingly. \u201cYou promised this\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d\nClint was the first to speak up. They were all shocked to see her. Wasn\u2019t she\ndead? Her head shot up and looked at them. She scanned the members and a smile\nadorned her face as she spotted him. </p><p>\u201cBruce!\u201d\nshe ran over to his cell, opened it and engulfed him in a hug. \u201cI missed you!\u201d</p><p>The man\nchuckled and hugged her back. \u201cI missed you too little one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nalive?\u201d she heard Tony ask.</p><p>\u201cStupid\nquestion.\u201d She replied as she helped Bruce release them all, not once turning\nto look at the hero.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\nwould be me.\u201d \u00a0A new voice came from the\ndoor. \u201cHello love.\u201d He greeted Y/N.</p><p>\u201cHello\nLoki.\u201d She answered with a smile. </p><p><br/></p><p>tags: @meyoko10</p>",

He had insisted that he go\nwith her, but she denied saying that he was needed here. That he had work he\nneeded to finish, and how he couldn\u2019t save the world if he came to her. It took\na great amount of persuasion and time to convince him but she did it. He didn\u2019t\nwant to, hell he hated the thought of it but she was right. As much as he hated\nthe people he once thought of as family he knew that he was needed here. With\none last tight tearful hug and a promise to keep in touch, he let her go. He\nknew she needed to heal from it all.</p><p>He walked\ninto the room to see his team. He studied each one of them. Nat sat with her\nhead in her hands shoulders shaking lightly. Clint had stray tears on his cheek\nas he stared at the wall. Thor was silently looking out the window. Tony was\ndrinking from his bar. Steve was holding Peggy\u2019s hand as she sat next to him.\nHe would\u2019ve felt sympathy for them, but he didn\u2019t. He just stared with them\nwith anger showing.</p><p>\u201cOh, stop\nwith the self-pity. You guys did this, especially you Rogers. You knew that she\nloves you. You knew that she doesn\u2019t trusted easily and yet she trusted you the\nmost. Don\u2019t sit there and cry to try to make yourselves feel better. Everyone\nsees you guys as heroes but you know what I see? I see a group of\ncowardly, pathetic, untrustworthy, selfish people.\u201d He stated and then walked\ntowards his lab. \u201cI truly hope you are happy together.\u201d He spoke to the couple on\nthe couch. </p><p>They\nflinched at his words but knew they he was right. They were selfish for keeping\nthis from her, but Steve felt the enormity of his words. He truly was a coward.\nA selfish, cheating coward. </p><hr><p>They stood\nstunned as they saw the news. They couldn\u2019t believe it. She was dead. They\nlistened to the news and cried quietly. It has been two months since it all\nhappened and everything hasn\u2019t been the same. The laughter was gone. Light no\nlonger shone into the tower. No one ate dinner together anymore. Movie night,\ntaco Tuesday, everything was gone. Missions and briefing was the only\ninteractions they had anymore. As for Peggy and Steve, they tried to make it\nwork. After-all, this all happened because of them two. They tried but Steve\nwas wrong about it all. And that is what made him regret it more. He gave up\ntrue love for the memory of love. He thought he had loved Peggy but he soon\nfound out that he loved the memories he had with her. They broke up not long\nafter.</p><p>\u201cToday we\nmourn. Earth has just lost one of her greatest defenders. The body of Y/N King\nwas found in her apartment in Las Vegas, Nevada earlier this morning. She was\nfound by room service at 8 AM this morning. It is rumored that she committed suicide,\nbut the officers are still invest\u2014\u201c</p><p>The\nnewscaster\u2019s voice was drowned out. They couldn\u2019t bare to listen. Someone once asked, \u201cHow do you lose someone twice?\u201d This is how. Steve got up silently and walked\nto his room. He blamed himself for it all. If he had trusted his heart, she\nwould still be here. Hell, they would\u2019ve been married by now. </p><p>He\nclosed the door to his room and walked to the bed they once shared. He couldn\u2019t\nsleep in it after\u00a0 Y/N left, so he shared another room with Peggy. He walked over\nto the side Y/N usually slept on and laid down. He hugged her pillow tightly\nto his chest as he gripped the picture of them together on their engagement\nparty. He screamed and cried hours upon hours. He wanted the pain to end. He\nfell asleep whispering her name and endless \u2018I love you\u2019s\u2019.</p><p>Bruce\nwas on the other side of the building trying to calm himself. He desperately\ndidn\u2019t want to believe that his little sister was gone. He screamed and cried.\nJust as the other guy was about to come out his phone rang. </p><hr><p>The\nAvengers were captured and held in cells adjacent from one another. They were\ncaptured on a mission gone wrong due to a rat within their HQ. They screamed\nand tried to break through the bars but they were all secured in there. </p><p>The mighty\nheroes were silenced as a tall burly man walked in banging a stick against the\nbars as he walked. </p><p>\u201cIt is\ntruly great to see you all. I have to say, I thought it would\u2019ve been harder to\ncapture <i>Earth\u2019s greatest defenders</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew\nyou!\u201d Tony yelled from his cell and he was met with agreements from Clint who\nwas on his left. </p><p>\u201cNo thank\nyou.\u201d He walked to Natalie. \u201cHello love. It\u2019s been too damn lo\u2014\u201d</p><p>He was\ninterrupted by a voice that sounded from the dark corner. \u201cHas anyone told you\nthat you talk too damn much Gertrude?\u201d She chuckled at the name. \u201cGertrude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are\nyou and how the hell did you get in here?\u201d he questioned loudly and he\nfrantically pressed the distress button. They all waited but no one came. </p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m\ninsulted that you don\u2019t know me. As for how I got in here, gas does wonders\nwhen released in the vents.\u201d</p><p>She walked\nunder the lights and all who were present gasped. </p><p>\u201cYou son\nof a bi\u2014\u201d he yelled as he attacked her. He was half way in the air when his\nbody dropped on the ground. Blood seeping from the bullet lodged in his\nforehead. Y/N sighed disappointingly. \u201cYou promised this\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d\nClint was the first to speak up. They were all shocked to see her. Wasn\u2019t she\ndead? Her head shot up and looked at them. She scanned the members and a smile\nadorned her face as she spotted him. </p><p>\u201cBruce!\u201d\nshe ran over to his cell, opened it and engulfed him in a hug. \u201cI missed you!\u201d</p><p>The man\nchuckled and hugged her back. \u201cI missed you too little one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nalive?\u201d she heard Tony ask.</p><p>\u201cStupid\nquestion.\u201d She replied as she helped Bruce release them all, not once turning\nto look at the hero.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\nwould be me.\u201d \u00a0A new voice came from the\ndoor. \u201cHello love.\u201d He greeted Y/N.</p><p>\u201cHello\nLoki.\u201d She answered with a smile. </p><p><br></p><p>tags: @meyoko10</p>",

You knew that she doesn\u2019t trusted easily and yet she trusted you the\nmost. Don\u2019t sit there and cry to try to make yourselves feel better. Everyone\nsees you guys as heroes but you know what I see? I see a group of\ncowardly, pathetic, untrustworthy, selfish people.\u201d He stated and then walked\ntowards his lab. \u201cI truly hope you are happy together.\u201d He spoke to the couple on\nthe couch. </p><p>They\nflinched at his words but knew they he was right. They were selfish for keeping\nthis from her, but Steve felt the enormity of his words. He truly was a coward.\nA selfish, cheating coward. </p><hr><p>They stood\nstunned as they saw the news. They couldn\u2019t believe it. She was dead. They\nlistened to the news and cried quietly. It has been two months since it all\nhappened and everything hasn\u2019t been the same. The laughter was gone. Light no\nlonger shone into the tower. No one ate dinner together anymore. Movie night,\ntaco Tuesday, everything was gone. Missions and briefing was the only\ninteractions they had anymore. As for Peggy and Steve, they tried to make it\nwork. After-all, this all happened because of them two. They tried but Steve\nwas wrong about it all. And that is what made him regret it more. He gave up\ntrue love for the memory of love. He thought he had loved Peggy but he soon\nfound out that he loved the memories he had with her. They broke up not long\nafter.</p><p>\u201cToday we\nmourn. Earth has just lost one of her greatest defenders. The body of Y/N King\nwas found in her apartment in Las Vegas, Nevada earlier this morning. She was\nfound by room service at 8 AM this morning. It is rumored that she committed suicide,\nbut the officers are still invest\u2014\u201c</p><p>The\nnewscaster\u2019s voice was drowned out. They couldn\u2019t bare to listen. Someone once asked, \u201cHow do you lose someone twice?\u201d This is how. Steve got up silently and walked\nto his room. He blamed himself for it all. If he had trusted his heart, she\nwould still be here. Hell, they would\u2019ve been married by now. </p><p>He\nclosed the door to his room and walked to the bed they once shared. He couldn\u2019t\nsleep in it after\u00a0 Y/N left, so he shared another room with Peggy. He walked over\nto the side Y/N usually slept on and laid down. He hugged her pillow tightly\nto his chest as he gripped the picture of them together on their engagement\nparty. He screamed and cried hours upon hours. He wanted the pain to end. He\nfell asleep whispering her name and endless \u2018I love you\u2019s\u2019.</p><p>Bruce\nwas on the other side of the building trying to calm himself. He desperately\ndidn\u2019t want to believe that his little sister was gone. He screamed and cried.\nJust as the other guy was about to come out his phone rang. </p><hr><p>The\nAvengers were captured and held in cells adjacent from one another.

I have to say, I thought it would\u2019ve been harder to\ncapture <i>Earth\u2019s greatest defenders</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew\nyou!\u201d Tony yelled from his cell and he was met with agreements from Clint who\nwas on his left. </p><p>\u201cNo thank\nyou.\u201d He walked to Natalie. \u201cHello love.

They all waited but no one came. </p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m\ninsulted that you don\u2019t know me. As for how I got in here, gas does wonders\nwhen released in the vents.\u201d</p><p>She walked\nunder the lights and all who were present gasped. </p><p>\u201cYou son\nof a bi\u2014\u201d he yelled as he attacked her.

I love you, but I also love her.&rdquo;</i> </p><p>She\nnodded wordlessly and walked out of their shared room at the tower. She didn&rsquo;t\nsay anything because there was nothing to say. What could one reply to that?\nShe didn&rsquo;t hate him. No, she loved him too much for that. She was just\ndisappointed and hurt. Three years of her life, three of the happiest years\nwere spent with a man who she thought loved her and only her. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The broken-hearted girl walked\naimlessly around the great city of New York. The place was full of life and\nbright, but to her it was the exact opposite. Dull and lifeless. She finally\nbroke down on a bench at an abandon park. It was hidden from the rest of the\ncity, and due to the rustiness of the swings and the bench she could tell that\nit was old. She sat there with tears running down her face as she sat there\nstaring into nothing. </p><p>Steve sat\non the couch crying. He didn&rsquo;t know what to do. For the first time since the serum life, he was lost. He loves you, but he also loves Peggy. It hurt so much to see her\nin so much pain but he was so happy to see his first love whom he thought was\ngone. </p><p>He jumped\nwhen the front door swing open and in walked the rest of his team. They all\nlooked guilty, all but one. Bruce. He was angry. All he knew was that something was wrong. That Y/N was hurting. He doesn&rsquo;t know how, he could just feel it. He just knew something was wrong and it had to do with Captain America himself. It took all his self-control to\nnot let the Other Guy out but he was tempted to just so he could beat Steve to\na pulp. He would&rsquo;ve but his main concern was to find the woman whom he has come\nto adore and call his younger sister. He didn&rsquo;t spare a look at the crying man\nand walked around the apartment looking for her.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N! Y/N!&rdquo; he kept yelling as he frantically looks for her. He made his way back to\nthe living room. &ldquo;Where is she?!&rdquo;</p><p>Steve\nlooked up at the fuming man. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What the\nhell do you mean you don&rsquo;t know?!&rdquo; he screamed as the green guy started to come\nthrough. <i>The Other </i>guy isn&rsquo;t the most\nintelligent but he adored Y/N as much as Bruce did. She was the only one to\ncalm him down and wasn&rsquo;t afraid to be close to him and he was furious to know\nthat she was gone.</p><p>&ldquo;She just\nwalked out. She-she&hellip; I lost her.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What the\nhell do you mean you lost her?&rdquo; he looked at his team members for backup only\nto see the same guilty look had adorned their faces too. &ldquo;What the hell did you\nguys do?&rdquo; he asked, voice barely above a whisper. He was afraid of the answer.\nIt was at that moment that a woman walked in that the blood had drained his\nface. &ldquo;P-Peggy? Wh-what are you&hellip; No. Hell no!&rdquo; he turned to Steve. &ldquo;You piece\nof sh&mdash;&rdquo; he didn&rsquo;t get to finish as the <i>Other\nGuy </i>broke through. Bruce grew incredibly taller and green. He started for\nthe man on the couch. Everyone reacted in seconds trying to calm down the green\nguy but he was too far gone. He smashed everything and everyone in his path. He\nhad gotten to Steve and started pummeling the blonde man.</p><p>&ldquo;Bruce!&rdquo; a\nvoice screamed from the doorway and he stopped immediately and turned to her. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N/N?&rdquo; the\noverly green guy asked. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s\nY/N/N.&rdquo; She replied as she took a step forward and was stopped by voices of\nconcern from the others in the room. She disregarded them quickly and walked\ntowards the Hulk. &ldquo;Come on big boy. Let Bruce come back so I can talk to him\nyeah?&rdquo; she asked softly as she laid a hand on his big green ones. His eyes\nsoftened and he nodded. Within seconds Bruce stood where the green guy was.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N/N.&rdquo; He\ncried and hugged her. He was relieved that she was back. </p><p>Their\nmoment was broken when Peggy spoke up. &ldquo;Steve? Are you alright.&rdquo; </p><p>She turned\nto see Steve, and it wasn&rsquo;t a pretty sight. He was bloodied and bruised. She\nwatched as Peggy ran over to him and he gave her a smile as well as he could\nand she felt her heart shatter again. She looked at the rest of the team and\nshe felt betrayed. They all knew of Steve&rsquo;s infidelity and didn&rsquo;t want to tell her. All except Bruce. She looked at the people\nshe thought of as family, the people she loved and trusted with her life. Guess\nthey didn&rsquo;t regard her as the same. She silently walked to her room, along with\nBruce, and gathered all her belongings. She had stuffed them into a suitcase.\nShe looked at the dresser and saw the picture of them on the day he proposed to\nher. They had bright smiles on their faces and their eyes spoke volumes of love\nthey held for the other. <i>Where did I go\nwrong?</i> She took off the ring and placed it next to the picture and\ncontinued out the room.</p><p>As she\nwalked towards the front door she was met with the team. They looked down at\nthe suitcase and panicked. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We can&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait&mdash;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Baby.&rdquo;</p><p>The last\none caught her attention. She turned to him. He was healed, not all the way but\ngood enough due to the late Stark&rsquo;s creation.</p><p>&ldquo;I have\nwhat I need. You can throw the rest away. The ring is on the dresser.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nyours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was when\nyou meant the words you said when you gave it to me. Goodbye.&rdquo; With that she\nwalked out, Bruce following quietly. He shook his head shamefully at his team. </p><p>He\nwalked her to the front door and talked with her. He had insisted that he go\nwith her, but she denied saying that he was needed here. That he had work he\nneeded to finish, and how he couldn&rsquo;t save the world if he came to her. It took\na great amount of persuasion and time to convince him but she did it. He didn&rsquo;t\nwant to, hell he hated the thought of it but she was right. As much as he hated\nthe people he once thought of as family he knew that he was needed here. With\none last tight tearful hug and a promise to keep in touch, he let her go. He\nknew she needed to heal from it all.</p><p>He walked\ninto the room to see his team. He studied each one of them. Nat sat with her\nhead in her hands shoulders shaking lightly. Clint had stray tears on his cheek\nas he stared at the wall. Thor was silently looking out the window. Tony was\ndrinking from his bar. Steve was holding Peggy&rsquo;s hand as she sat next to him.\nHe would&rsquo;ve felt sympathy for them, but he didn&rsquo;t. He just stared with them\nwith anger showing.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, stop\nwith the self-pity. You guys did this, especially you Rogers. You knew that she\nloves you.

You\u2019re not really sure if he ever knew, even though there were times when it seemed like he did. And after graduating, you both went your separate ways but you still had those feelings for him. Years later, he reenters your life in the craziest way. And what follows after, gives you so many new experiences in life.</p><p>[Pairing]: Tony x reader</p><p><i>A/N</i>: This series has been inspired by my \u2018Love Songs\u2019 playlist on <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/user/1297446541/playlist/4MmEI3Hsd009UcWeHIXdHP?si=BEzjyVlFT-aS_ZmxDCHiwQ\">Spotify</a>\u00a0and real-life events that have happened to me (although a couple things are different. And each part will be based off a song or two from the playlist).

Not that you were failing, but you felt like you had a gloom cloud hanging over your head constantly.\u00a0Yet what was strange was the fact that Tony still wanted to be around you and have you hang out with him. And what made it worse? Was that you couldn\u2019t really stay mad at him.</p><p>Within a few weeks after him telling you he had a girlfriend, everything seemed like it was back to normal between the two of you; sitting next to each other in class, hanging out by the tree while studying and even the flirting started back up! You wanted to question why seeing as how he was with someone but you also didn\u2019t want to cause a riff in your friendship again.</p><!-- more --><p>As the the school year came to a close and the days became longer and warmer, you asked him if he was going to be in the next level of the class. He shrugged and said he\u2019d have to think about it, while giving you a small smile. You gave him a playful shove.</p><p>\u201cYou can count on it,\u201d he said and gave you a peck on the cheek.\u00a0Your face turned cherry red and felt extremely hot. Ghosting your fingers over the spot his lips just touched, you smiled and buried your face in hands.</p><p>\u201cSo, what are you doing for summer break?\u201d Tony asked as he tapped his pencil on the edge of his book.<br/></p><p>You looked back up and placed your book in your lap. \u201cSame thing as I do every year. My family and I go up to our lake house and spend the entire summer there. It\u2019s quite fun actually. The only issues I really have is when my sister brings one of her boyfriends with and they complain about everything.\u201d You paused and wrote down some notes.\u00a0\u201cBut I do like that we can cut off everything and not be bothered for a few months. What are you gonna do?\u201d</p><p>Tony shrugged.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know. Probably hang out at my aunts house for a bit cuz my cousins are gonna be visiting for about a month and I haven&rsquo;t seen them in so long. After that, I\u2019ll probably hang out with some other friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that sounds nice. My cousins rarely visit us, which sucks but it is what it is.\u201d<br/></p><p>As the bell rang for lunch to end, the two of you packed up your stuff, said bye and headed different directions to your next class. You\u00a0couldn\u2019t help but stare out the window and wonder if you should\u2019ve asked Tony to come with. But you brushed the thought out of your head because you knew that your mother would never allow that. You asking if a guy friend could come with and her not knowing him? You already knew that that would spell disaster.</p><hr><p>Summer came and went and as soon as school started back up, it seemed like you were already on Christmas Break. The last two years of school seemed to go the same way. And before you knew it, you both graduated.</p><p>And in those last two years, things between you and Tony went pretty smooth. Granted, there still was never a time that he asked you out or to be his girlfriend, but you never saw him with another girl afterwards. And since you thought it would be best not to ruin your friendship on something like that, you never brought up the situation or became pushy about why he never asked you out.\u00a0The flirting went on non-stop between you two though. The spot under the oak tree had pretty much become\u00a0\u201cyour spot\u201d to hang out during lunch and when you two had free time to study.</p><p>And once graduation came, it was a moment to remember. Getting to wear a new dress that was different shades of greens and blues plus white, you were hoping to impress him a bit. And when you saw him in a suit, you almost fell and had to place your hand on the wall for support. As you walked over to him you smiled and waved your hand to get his attention which he noticed and smiled back. As you came closer to him, you inhaled the intoxicating scent of the cologne he was wearing, which made you weak in the knees. He\u00a0then scrunched his face in\u00a0approvement\u00a0over your dress, looking you over and smirked.</p><p>\u201cWell, you look absolutely stunning,\u201d\u00a0he said.<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t look so bad yourself,\u201d you playfully teased.\u00a0</p><p>A little more small talk happened between the two of you and then it was time for the graduation ceremony to start. Sitting nervously in your chair, you kept playing with one spot on the end of your dress until a hand snaked it\u2019s way in between your fingers. Tony quickly glanced over at you and gave a small smile. You gave him a half smile and you seemed to calm down a bit after that. He held your hand right up to the moment they called you up. And once you went through the line of shaking hands with the teachers and sat back down, you felt even better.</p><p>And after everything was all said and done, it was time to party.\u00a0You hugged Tony and told him you were going to look for your parents. You pushed your way through the sea of people and managed to find them off to the side. Both of them had big beaming smiles on their faces and gave you the biggest hug possible.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re so proud of you,\u201d your mom said, tears coming to her eyes as she fixed your hair.<br/></p><p>\u201cImmensely proud.\u201d<br/></p><p>You thanked them both.\u00a0\u201cOh, and there\u2019s someone I want you to meet.\u201d\u00a0They both looked a little surprised but you waved it off.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t worry. He\u2019s just a friend.\u201d\u00a0Taking both of their hands, you meandered through the crowd and found Tony talking with his family.</p><p>\u201cTony. Tony!\u201d<br/></p><p>He turned around and smiled, excusing himself from his parents and walked over to you\u00a0\u201cAh! [Y/N]. I was hoping to see you again.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Giving him a hug, you then cleared your throat.\u00a0\u201cTony, I\u2019d like you to meet my parents, Mr. and Mrs. [Y/L/N]. Mom, Dad, this is Tony. He\u00a0was in one of my classes. We were study buddies and he helped me out quite a bit in class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d your mom said, nodding with a smile.<br/></p><p>Your dad put out his hand to Tony, who was hesitant for a second but then shook it.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s very nice to meet you, Tony. I trust that you were able to keep up with my girl? She\u2019s quite the smart one.\u201d</p><p>Tony gave a soft chuckle while you playfully nudged your dad.\u00a0\u201c<i>Daaaad</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine [Y/N],\u201d Tony said still smiling. He wrapped his arm around your shoulders.\u00a0\u201cI was. She\u2019s a very smart girl. I had a great time getting to be in the same class as her.\u201d</p><p>You smiled and looked down, placing some loose hair behind your ear. You tried not to show how pink your face turned.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was very nice meeting you, Mr. and Mrs. [Y/L/N],\u201d Tony said, letting go of you and shaking your parents hands again. Turning to you, he said,\u00a0\u201cAnd\u00a0there\u2019s a couple people I\u2019d like you to meet too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, ok,\u201d you said, a bit of surprise in your voice. You looked at your parents who smiled and nodded.<br/></p><p>\u201cGo on. We\u2019ll see you at the house,\u201d your mom said. She pulled you in for a hug and kissed your cheek and then you hugged your dad.<br/></p><p>Tony half smiled, said goodnight to your parents again and took your hand, pushing his way back through the crowd to his family.</p><p>\u201cMom, dad, there\u2019s someone I\u2019d like you to meet.\u201d\u00a0They turned around and smiled at you.\u00a0\u201c[Y/N], this is my mom and dad, Mr. and Mrs. Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you,\u201d you said nervously as you shook hands with his parents.<br/></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve heard so much about you. And you\u2019re just as pretty as Tony described you,\u201d Mrs. Stark said.\u00a0You smiled and you could feel your cheeks burn hot from blushing so hard.</p><p>Having a hour of small talk happen with Tony and his parents, you checked your phone and realized it was getting late. You said your goodbyes to Tony\u2019s parents and he walked you outside to your car.</p><p>\u201cIt was really great knowing you Tony. I had a really good time in class with you.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cSame here,\u201d he said and he placed a hand on each side of you, leaning in to kiss you. You hesitated as his lips ghosted over yours and you felt your breath hitch in your throat.</p><p>Before anything could happen, you pulled away.\u00a0\u201cI&hellip; I really have.. to get going,\u201d you stuttered as you put your hand in your purse and fumbled around for your keys. When you looked up after finding them, Tony\u2019s nose was centimeters from yours. Your eyes darted from his eyes, to his lips then back to his eyes.\u00a0\u201cI really do, Tony. I have to get going.\u201d</p><p>He pulled his hands off your car so you could open the door. He closed it once you were in and you rolled down the window when you started the car.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll see you around some time?\u201d he asked.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll be living with my aunt for a bit and she lives just down the street from here.\u201d<br/></p><p>You shrugged.\u00a0\u201cMaybe. My parents live around here too so there\u2019s a chance we might run into each other. We\u2019ll just have to see.\u201d You quickly kissed him on the cheek and started pulling away, rolling up your window as well so he couldn\u2019t have time to react.</p><p>You laughed a bit as you drove away and he laughed as well as he jogged after your car for a second. He stood there in the middle of the parking lot and wondered if he\u2019d ever really see you again. Going to his car, he sat inside for a few minutes and pondered over the feelings he sort of had for you.</p><hr><p>As another summer was coming to an end, you were starting to feel the pressure of college debt creeping in and the hopes that it would all be paid off quickly were coming to a halt.

You wanted to question why seeing as how he was with someone but you also didn\u2019t want to cause a riff in your friendship again.</p>[[MORE]]<p>As the the school year came to a close and the days became longer and warmer, you asked him if he was going to be in the next level of the class. He shrugged and said he\u2019d have to think about it, while giving you a small smile. You gave him a playful shove.</p><p>\u201cYou can count on it,\u201d he said and gave you a peck on the cheek.\u00a0Your face turned cherry red and felt extremely hot. Ghosting your fingers over the spot his lips just touched, you smiled and buried your face in hands.</p><p>\u201cSo, what are you doing for summer break?\u201d Tony asked as he tapped his pencil on the edge of his book.<br></p><p>You looked back up and placed your book in your lap. \u201cSame thing as I do every year. My family and I go up to our lake house and spend the entire summer there. It\u2019s quite fun actually. The only issues I really have is when my sister brings one of her boyfriends with and they complain about everything.\u201d You paused and wrote down some notes.\u00a0\u201cBut I do like that we can cut off everything and not be bothered for a few months. What are you gonna do?\u201d</p><p>Tony shrugged.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know. Probably hang out at my aunts house for a bit cuz my cousins are gonna be visiting for about a month and I haven\u2019t seen them in so long. After that, I\u2019ll probably hang out with some other friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that sounds nice. My cousins rarely visit us, which sucks but it is what it is.\u201d<br></p><p>As the bell rang for lunch to end, the two of you packed up your stuff, said bye and headed different directions to your next class. You\u00a0couldn\u2019t help but stare out the window and wonder if you should\u2019ve asked Tony to come with. But you brushed the thought out of your head because you knew that your mother would never allow that. You asking if a guy friend could come with and her not knowing him? You already knew that that would spell disaster.</p><hr><p>Summer came and went and as soon as school started back up, it seemed like you were already on Christmas Break. The last two years of school seemed to go the same way. And before you knew it, you both graduated.</p><p>And in those last two years, things between you and Tony went pretty smooth. Granted, there still was never a time that he asked you out or to be his girlfriend, but you never saw him with another girl afterwards. And since you thought it would be best not to ruin your friendship on something like that, you never brought up the situation or became pushy about why he never asked you out.\u00a0The flirting went on non-stop between you two though. The spot under the oak tree had pretty much become\u00a0\u201cyour spot\u201d to hang out during lunch and when you two had free time to study.</p><p>And once graduation came, it was a moment to remember. Getting to wear a new dress that was different shades of greens and blues plus white, you were hoping to impress him a bit. And when you saw him in a suit, you almost fell and had to place your hand on the wall for support. As you walked over to him you smiled and waved your hand to get his attention which he noticed and smiled back. As you came closer to him, you inhaled the intoxicating scent of the cologne he was wearing, which made you weak in the knees. He\u00a0then scrunched his face in\u00a0approvement\u00a0over your dress, looking you over and smirked.</p><p>\u201cWell, you look absolutely stunning,\u201d\u00a0he said.<br></p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t look so bad yourself,\u201d you playfully teased.\u00a0</p><p>A little more small talk happened between the two of you and then it was time for the graduation ceremony to start.

He shrugged and said he\u2019d have to think about it, while giving you a small smile. You gave him a playful shove.</p><p>\u201cYou can count on it,\u201d he said and gave you a peck on the cheek.\u00a0Your face turned cherry red and felt extremely hot. Ghosting your fingers over the spot his lips just touched, you smiled and buried your face in hands.</p><p>\u201cSo, what are you doing for summer break?\u201d Tony asked as he tapped his pencil on the edge of his book.<br></p><p>You looked back up and placed your book in your lap. \u201cSame thing as I do every year. My family and I go up to our lake house and spend the entire summer there. It\u2019s quite fun actually. The only issues I really have is when my sister brings one of her boyfriends with and they complain about everything.\u201d You paused and wrote down some notes.\u00a0\u201cBut I do like that we can cut off everything and not be bothered for a few months. What are you gonna do?\u201d</p><p>Tony shrugged.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know. Probably hang out at my aunts house for a bit cuz my cousins are gonna be visiting for about a month and I haven\u2019t seen them in so long. After that, I\u2019ll probably hang out with some other friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that sounds nice. My cousins rarely visit us, which sucks but it is what it is.\u201d<br></p><p>As the bell rang for lunch to end, the two of you packed up your stuff, said bye and headed different directions to your next class. You\u00a0couldn\u2019t help but stare out the window and wonder if you should\u2019ve asked Tony to come with. But you brushed the thought out of your head because you knew that your mother would never allow that. You asking if a guy friend could come with and her not knowing him? You already knew that that would spell disaster.</p><hr><p>Summer came and went and as soon as school started back up, it seemed like you were already on Christmas Break. The last two years of school seemed to go the same way. And before you knew it, you both graduated.</p><p>And in those last two years, things between you and Tony went pretty smooth. Granted, there still was never a time that he asked you out or to be his girlfriend, but you never saw him with another girl afterwards. And since you thought it would be best not to ruin your friendship on something like that, you never brought up the situation or became pushy about why he never asked you out.\u00a0The flirting went on non-stop between you two though. The spot under the oak tree had pretty much become\u00a0\u201cyour spot\u201d to hang out during lunch and when you two had free time to study.</p><p>And once graduation came, it was a moment to remember. Getting to wear a new dress that was different shades of greens and blues plus white, you were hoping to impress him a bit. And when you saw him in a suit, you almost fell and had to place your hand on the wall for support. As you walked over to him you smiled and waved your hand to get his attention which he noticed and smiled back. As you came closer to him, you inhaled the intoxicating scent of the cologne he was wearing, which made you weak in the knees. He\u00a0then scrunched his face in\u00a0approvement\u00a0over your dress, looking you over and smirked.</p><p>\u201cWell, you look absolutely stunning,\u201d\u00a0he said.<br></p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t look so bad yourself,\u201d you playfully teased.\u00a0</p><p>A little more small talk happened between the two of you and then it was time for the graduation ceremony to start. Sitting nervously in your chair, you kept playing with one spot on the end of your dress until a hand snaked it\u2019s way in between your fingers. Tony quickly glanced over at you and gave a small smile. You gave him a half smile and you seemed to calm down a bit after that. He held your hand right up to the moment they called you up. And once you went through the line of shaking hands with the teachers and sat back down, you felt even better.</p><p>And after everything was all said and done, it was time to party.\u00a0You hugged Tony and told him you were going to look for your parents. You pushed your way through the sea of people and managed to find them off to the side. Both of them had big beaming smiles on their faces and gave you the biggest hug possible.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re so proud of you,\u201d your mom said, tears coming to her eyes as she fixed your hair.<br></p><p>\u201cImmensely proud.\u201d<br></p><p>You thanked them both.\u00a0\u201cOh, and there\u2019s someone I want you to meet.\u201d\u00a0They both looked a little surprised but you waved it off.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t worry. He\u2019s just a friend.\u201d\u00a0Taking both of their hands, you meandered through the crowd and found Tony talking with his family.</p><p>\u201cTony. Tony!\u201d<br></p><p>He turned around and smiled, excusing himself from his parents and walked over to you\u00a0\u201cAh! [Y/N]. I was hoping to see you again.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Giving him a hug, you then cleared your throat.\u00a0\u201cTony, I\u2019d like you to meet my parents, Mr. and Mrs. [Y/L/N]. Mom, Dad, this is Tony. He\u00a0was in one of my classes. We were study buddies and he helped me out quite a bit in class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d your mom said, nodding with a smile.<br></p><p>Your dad put out his hand to Tony, who was hesitant for a second but then shook it.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s very nice to meet you, Tony. I trust that you were able to keep up with my girl? She\u2019s quite the smart one.\u201d</p><p>Tony gave a soft chuckle while you playfully nudged your dad.\u00a0\u201c<i>Daaaad</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine [Y/N],\u201d Tony said still smiling. He wrapped his arm around your shoulders.\u00a0\u201cI was. She\u2019s a very smart girl. I had a great time getting to be in the same class as her.\u201d</p><p>You smiled and looked down, placing some loose hair behind your ear. You tried not to show how pink your face turned.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was very nice meeting you, Mr. and Mrs. [Y/L/N],\u201d Tony said, letting go of you and shaking your parents hands again. Turning to you, he said,\u00a0\u201cAnd\u00a0there\u2019s a couple people I\u2019d like you to meet too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, ok,\u201d you said, a bit of surprise in your voice. You looked at your parents who smiled and nodded.<br></p><p>\u201cGo on. We\u2019ll see you at the house,\u201d your mom said. She pulled you in for a hug and kissed your cheek and then you hugged your dad.<br></p><p>Tony half smiled, said goodnight to your parents again and took your hand, pushing his way back through the crowd to his family.</p><p>\u201cMom, dad, there\u2019s someone I\u2019d like you to meet.\u201d\u00a0They turned around and smiled at you.\u00a0\u201c[Y/N], this is my mom and dad, Mr. and Mrs. Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you,\u201d you said nervously as you shook hands with his parents.<br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve heard so much about you. And you\u2019re just as pretty as Tony described you,\u201d Mrs. Stark said.\u00a0You smiled and you could feel your cheeks burn hot from blushing so hard.</p><p>Having a hour of small talk happen with Tony and his parents, you checked your phone and realized it was getting late. You said your goodbyes to Tony\u2019s parents and he walked you outside to your car.</p><p>\u201cIt was really great knowing you Tony. I had a really good time in class with you.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSame here,\u201d he said and he placed a hand on each side of you, leaning in to kiss you. You hesitated as his lips ghosted over yours and you felt your breath hitch in your throat.</p><p>Before anything could happen, you pulled away.\u00a0\u201cI\u2026 I really have.. to get going,\u201d you stuttered as you put your hand in your purse and fumbled around for your keys. When you looked up after finding them, Tony\u2019s nose was centimeters from yours. Your eyes darted from his eyes, to his lips then back to his eyes.\u00a0\u201cI really do, Tony. I have to get going.\u201d</p><p>He pulled his hands off your car so you could open the door. He closed it once you were in and you rolled down the window when you started the car.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll see you around some time?\u201d he asked.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll be living with my aunt for a bit and she lives just down the street from here.\u201d<br></p><p>You shrugged.\u00a0\u201cMaybe. My parents live around here too so there\u2019s a chance we might run into each other. We\u2019ll just have to see.\u201d You quickly kissed him on the cheek and started pulling away, rolling up your window as well so he couldn\u2019t have time to react.</p><p>You laughed a bit as you drove away and he laughed as well as he jogged after your car for a second.
