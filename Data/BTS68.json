He rolled his eyes at the dramatics, clearly not in the mood for her attitude, truthfully he knew this was going to happen, hence why he never said a name, just that he was really big at the moment and it would be perfect for her career.  </p><p>\u2018You signed the contract, he is really big over here you need to branch out, get out of your comfort zone!\u2019 Smoke practically puffed out her ears, this was not happening, no way did she have to work with this insufferable idiot.  </p><p>\u2018Working with her? Are you for real?!\u2019 He huffed slamming his hand down on his desk, seconds later skimming everything over just in case he broke something. He huffed out a breath rolling his eyes and getting himself together, his short temper was not going to help here. </p><p>\u2018Fine, when she\u2019s done being a twelve year old, let her in.\u2019 The man nodded exiting the room, going promptly to find her before Yoongi changed his mind. </p><!-- more --><p>\u2018I know who the fuck he is Daniel, that doesn\u2019t mean I-\u2018 </p><p>\u2018He says you can start whenever you\u2019re ready.\u2019 The man poked his head into the room, then quickly removed himself. She looked at Daniel and let out a guttural groan, this was not going to be easy. She had to gather herself, get her mood together, she hated this man with all her being but her career needed this collaboration. Taking a deep breath she walked towards his studio, Daniel following closely behind. </p><p>\u2018Daniel just leave us alone to do this I don\u2019t need you as a damn shadow.\u2019 She spoke reaching the door, Yoongi could hear the voices on the other side, subtly listening in to the conversation, she knocked on the door waiting to be allowed in. </p><p>\u2018You think I\u2019m leaving that\u2019s cute, you\u2019ll ruin this on your own.\u2019 Wow thanks for the vote of confidence she thought, she crossed her arms tapping her foot waiting impatiently. The door opened a crack, Yoongi standing in the way of her and the room, he looked her up and down then Daniel promptly after. </p><p>\u2018If we have to do this, I work alone, it\u2019s bad enough you have to come in here, I won\u2019t allow him too.\u2019 If she rolled her eyes one more time in the next ten minutes they would stay at the back of her head, looking over at Daniel she raised a hand shooing him away, he looked between them in bewilderment.  </p><p>\u2018Wow look at that you actually agreed on something, progress!\u2019 He mumbled walking away, Yoongi stepped aside letting her shuffle into the room. It was quite a plain little room white walls, a black leather couch behind her and his set up in front. She sat down at one end of the couch, pulling out her laptop and notebook, he sat down beside her leaning back. He was attractive, she would give him that, his side profile was quite powerful, jawline in sharp contrast to his chubby little cheeks. She gathered herself quickly remembering who she was eyeing up, there was no getting over what he did, she was probably holding a grudge over nothing, but a grudge all the same. </p><p>\u2018So do you have any thoughts on how you want this to go or\u2026?\u2019 She questioned, he rolled his head round to look at her, admiring her face, to think he used to actually be a fan, head still resting on the back of the couch, he huffed out a sigh.  </p><p>\u2018Not really, usually I see a plan, but at the moment I\u2019m unmotivated and unbothered.\u2019 He replied, turning his head back to looking at the ceiling. She stared at him dumbfounded, this fucking man. She groaned, falling back on the couch too. </p><p>\u2018Fine.\u2019 She replied bluntly, unlocking her phone going onto an app. </p><p>\u2018What are you doing now?\u2019 He grunted, she rolled her eyes. </p><p>\u2018I\u2019m ordering us food, because if we aren\u2019t going to work, I would rather eat something.\u2019 His head shot around looking her up and down, a woman after his own heart, you know despite the hating each other thing. She clicked a few buttons handing the phone to him letting him place his order, he punched in the address and his card details placing the order.  </p><p>\u2018Did you just\u2026?\u2019 She questioned, already knowing the answer.  </p><p>\u2018Pay for our meal, yes, I did.\u2019 A frown crossed her brow, did he think she couldn\u2019t afford a food order? She chucked her phone down beside her turning her body to look at him.  </p><p>\u2018Do you not think I can pay for these things myself what the hell?\u2019 He looked at her stunned, he stood up from his place beside her slamming himself down in his computer chair.  </p><p>\u2018Are you really about to pick a fight? All I did was do something nice, Jesus.\u2019 He spun around looking intently at his screen trying to find a beat for this stupid song. She took a twenty out her purse slamming it down beside him.  </p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t need your charity, I\u2019m going down to wait for the food.\u2019 With that she swiftly walked out of the room, slamming the door behind her. He sighed and winced slightly waiting for his glass door to break at the force of the slam, he looked down at the money frowning, why could she not just apologise, why could he not just say sorry? No she started this, there was no way he was going to be the first to cave.  </p><p>\u2018Daniel he is insufferable, I can\u2019t do this!\u2019 She spoke through the phone, he had apparently went out to get food himself clearly happy with the knowledge they hadn\u2019t murdered each other yet.  </p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sure its not that bad you\u2019re just being dramatic as always.\u2019 She practically fizzed, he wasn\u2019t in the room, he didn\u2019t know how full of himself he was, this was hopeless.  </p><p>\u2018The contract isn\u2019t worth this I can\u2019t do it I-\u2018  </p><p>\u2018The uh, the food came straight to my studio, it\u2019s waiting when you\u2019re ready.\u2019 He spoke carefully, trying not to anger her more. Nodding briefly she turned away from him ending the call promptly.  </p><p>\u2018I have to go, but I\u2019m telling you this is a lost cause.\u2019 Before he had a time to answer she hung up the call, taking the path back to the small room she was going to spend 90% of her days in until the terms of this damn contract were completed. He sat on the floor already digging into the food he had ordered, hers still sitting in the boxes, she took the place across from him opening them. He looked at her for a good minute before opening his mouth to speak, she seemed calm for the time being.  </p><p>\u2018Why do you hate me so much?\u2019 He questioned, tone slightly more upset and hurt than he wanted it to come out. She looked up at him, eyes practically bugging out her head, noodles resting between her lips. He giggled at her stunned expression, she snapped out of it chewing the noodles and staring at him confused.  </p><p>\u2018I\u2026what?\u2019 At this point she really didn\u2019t have words, or at least words he wanted to hear, he tilted his head slightly to the left, placing his utensils down giving her his full attention.  </p><p>\u2018Why do you hate me, I didn\u2019t even know you before, but you just decided you hated me, why?\u2019 His tone was not accusatory, he looked and sounded more like a kicked puppy, whiney and pouty, her heart thumped in her chest a little bit faster, god he looked so adorable.  </p><p>\u2018I never hated you, I just don\u2019t understand-\u2018 She cut herself off, confused for a second. \u2018Wait before what?\u2019 He rolled his eyes, god he hated people who played dumb. He took out his phone googling her song and placing it down in front of her, she cringed internally, god this was the worst song she had ever made. She pressed the pause button, pulled a face and handed him back his phone.  </p><p>\u2018Okay I get it, it\u2019s a shit song, but what does that have to do with anything?\u2019 He sighed, maybe she was just stupid, like maybe it was a medical condition because there is no way.  </p><p>\u2018Do you really not know? Like for real?\u2019 She shrugged, still way beyond the point of confused.  </p><p>\u2018I mean I know you made a diss track about me, that\u2019s why I don\u2019t like you but I still don\u2019t know why you have such a problem with me.\u2019 She replied so nonchalantly, if he was standing it would have knocked him into a seat. He sat there, mouth falling open just to close again, he figured he resembled something like a puffer fish but couldn\u2019t find it within himself to care.  </p><p>\u2018WHAT!?\u2019 He screamed, there was no way this was happening. \u2018I only made that track because you made this one!\u2019 He yelled pointing at the phone screen, she looked between him and the phone, suddenly bursting out in a hearty laughter.  </p><p>\u2018You\u2019re so CUTE! That wasn\u2019t about you it was about my ex, what in heavens name made you think it was about you, I didn\u2019t even know who you were!\u2019 He blushed, flustered and embarrassed, of course she didn\u2019t know him why would she? </p><p>\u2018Oh uh, nothing it just, it had one of my lyrics in it, I thought you were having a dig at me, oh man this is embarrassing\u2026\u2019 He spoke avoiding eye contact at every possible moment, she giggled again, coming around to his side. Lifting his head up with two fingers under his chin, she forced his eyes onto her face.  </p><p>\u2018If it helps you any, I thought you looked really cute as you shit talked me, and you\u2019re really hot when angry.\u2019 She spoke creating tension before moving away quickly, straight back to shoveling noodles into her mouth.  </p><p>\u2018You are insufferable, I hope you realise.\u2019 She smirked nodding, as he also went back to his noodles.  </p><p>\u2018I get that a lot, don\u2019t worry.\u2019 There was silence for a while both of them finishing up their food, they cleaned up both settling down beside each other to begin this song.  </p><p>\u2018So if you didn\u2019t know who I was, how did you know about my track?\u2019 He questioned a couple hours into working, she looked over at him putting her pen down.  </p><p>\u2018My friend is a big fan, she recognized some hints towards me and showed me, I\u2019ve listened to it a few times actually, it\u2019s quite smart to be fair.\u2019 She spoke tearing the page out of the notebook, letting him read it. He shrugged, crossing out a few lines keeping the ones that he liked or made sense to him leaving her to figure out the rest.  </p><p>\u2018This is taking a lot longer than I expected, it\u2019s late maybe we should call it a night?\u2019 He looked over at her as she flopped into the couch, he nodded, she did look exhausted.  </p><p>\u2018Sure, is your hotel far from here? I could give you a lift?\u2019 He proposed, she looked at him and shook her head.  </p><p>\u2018It\u2019s okay it\u2019s really quite far out, I don\u2019t want to inconvenience you further.\u2019 He frowned, why would she get a hotel so far away from the only place she really HAD to be?  </p><p>\u2018Well seeing as we are working on this song together, how about you stay with me, I\u2019ll probably be in the home studio all night, that way if inspiration strikes you can come help? How\u2019s that sound?\u2019 She smirked, gathering her things, she stood up from the chair, holding her hand out to him she smiled warmly.  </p><p>\u2018I accept, but that bed better be the best thing I\u2019ve slept on for that diss track.\u2019 He sighed, taking her hand anyway.  </p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve changed my mind, you can stay away from my house, to think I was going to give you my bed.\u2019 He chuckled casually wrapping an arm around her shoulders.</p>",

He giggled at her stunned expression, she snapped out of it chewing the noodles and staring at him confused.  </p><p>\u2018I\u2026what?\u2019 At this point she really didn\u2019t have words, or at least words he wanted to hear, he tilted his head slightly to the left, placing his utensils down giving her his full attention.  </p><p>\u2018Why do you hate me, I didn\u2019t even know you before, but you just decided you hated me, why?\u2019 His tone was not accusatory, he looked and sounded more like a kicked puppy, whiney and pouty, her heart thumped in her chest a little bit faster, god he looked so adorable.  </p><p>\u2018I never hated you, I just don\u2019t understand-\u2018 She cut herself off, confused for a second. \u2018Wait before what?\u2019 He rolled his eyes, god he hated people who played dumb. He took out his phone googling her song and placing it down in front of her, she cringed internally, god this was the worst song she had ever made. She pressed the pause button, pulled a face and handed him back his phone.  </p><p>\u2018Okay I get it, it\u2019s a shit song, but what does that have to do with anything?\u2019 He sighed, maybe she was just stupid, like maybe it was a medical condition because there is no way.  </p><p>\u2018Do you really not know? Like for real?\u2019 She shrugged, still way beyond the point of confused.  </p><p>\u2018I mean I know you made a diss track about me, that\u2019s why I don\u2019t like you but I still don\u2019t know why you have such a problem with me.\u2019 She replied so nonchalantly, if he was standing it would have knocked him into a seat. He sat there, mouth falling open just to close again, he figured he resembled something like a puffer fish but couldn\u2019t find it within himself to care.  </p><p>\u2018WHAT!?\u2019 He screamed, there was no way this was happening. \u2018I only made that track because you made this one!\u2019 He yelled pointing at the phone screen, she looked between him and the phone, suddenly bursting out in a hearty laughter.  </p><p>\u2018You\u2019re so CUTE! That wasn\u2019t about you it was about my ex, what in heavens name made you think it was about you, I didn\u2019t even know who you were!\u2019 He blushed, flustered and embarrassed, of course she didn\u2019t know him why would she? </p><p>\u2018Oh uh, nothing it just, it had one of my lyrics in it, I thought you were having a dig at me, oh man this is embarrassing\u2026\u2019 He spoke avoiding eye contact at every possible moment, she giggled again, coming around to his side. Lifting his head up with two fingers under his chin, she forced his eyes onto her face.  </p><p>\u2018If it helps you any, I thought you looked really cute as you shit talked me, and you\u2019re really hot when angry.\u2019 She spoke creating tension before moving away quickly, straight back to shoveling noodles into her mouth.  </p><p>\u2018You are insufferable, I hope you realise.\u2019 She smirked nodding, as he also went back to his noodles.  </p><p>\u2018I get that a lot, don\u2019t worry.\u2019 There was silence for a while both of them finishing up their food, they cleaned up both settling down beside each other to begin this song.  </p><p>\u2018So if you didn\u2019t know who I was, how did you know about my track?\u2019 He questioned a couple hours into working, she looked over at him putting her pen down.  </p><p>\u2018My friend is a big fan, she recognized some hints towards me and showed me, I\u2019ve listened to it a few times actually, it\u2019s quite smart to be fair.\u2019 She spoke tearing the page out of the notebook, letting him read it. He shrugged, crossing out a few lines keeping the ones that he liked or made sense to him leaving her to figure out the rest.  </p><p>\u2018This is taking a lot longer than I expected, it\u2019s late maybe we should call it a night?\u2019 He looked over at her as she flopped into the couch, he nodded, she did look exhausted.  </p><p>\u2018Sure, is your hotel far from here? I could give you a lift?\u2019 He proposed, she looked at him and shook her head.  </p><p>\u2018It\u2019s okay it\u2019s really quite far out, I don\u2019t want to inconvenience you further.\u2019 He frowned, why would she get a hotel so far away from the only place she really HAD to be?  </p><p>\u2018Well seeing as we are working on this song together, how about you stay with me, I\u2019ll probably be in the home studio all night, that way if inspiration strikes you can come help? How\u2019s that sound?\u2019 She smirked, gathering her things, she stood up from the chair, holding her hand out to him she smiled warmly.  </p><p>\u2018I accept, but that bed better be the best thing I\u2019ve slept on for that diss track.\u2019 He sighed, taking her hand anyway.  </p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve changed my mind, you can stay away from my house, to think I was going to give you my bed.\u2019 He chuckled casually wrapping an arm around her shoulders.</p></p>",

He rolled his eyes at the dramatics, clearly not in the mood for her attitude, truthfully he knew this was going to happen, hence why he never said a name, just that he was really big at the moment and it would be perfect for her career.  </p><p>\u2018You signed the contract, he is really big over here you need to branch out, get out of your comfort zone!\u2019 Smoke practically puffed out her ears, this was not happening, no way did she have to work with this insufferable idiot.  </p><p>\u2018Working with her? Are you for real?!\u2019 He huffed slamming his hand down on his desk, seconds later skimming everything over just in case he broke something. He huffed out a breath rolling his eyes and getting himself together, his short temper was not going to help here. </p><p>\u2018Fine, when she\u2019s done being a twelve year old, let her in.\u2019 The man nodded exiting the room, going promptly to find her before Yoongi changed his mind. </p>[[MORE]]<p>\u2018I know who the fuck he is Daniel, that doesn\u2019t mean I-\u2018 </p><p>\u2018He says you can start whenever you\u2019re ready.\u2019 The man poked his head into the room, then quickly removed himself. She looked at Daniel and let out a guttural groan, this was not going to be easy. She had to gather herself, get her mood together, she hated this man with all her being but her career needed this collaboration. Taking a deep breath she walked towards his studio, Daniel following closely behind. </p><p>\u2018Daniel just leave us alone to do this I don\u2019t need you as a damn shadow.\u2019 She spoke reaching the door, Yoongi could hear the voices on the other side, subtly listening in to the conversation, she knocked on the door waiting to be allowed in. </p><p>\u2018You think I\u2019m leaving that\u2019s cute, you\u2019ll ruin this on your own.\u2019 Wow thanks for the vote of confidence she thought, she crossed her arms tapping her foot waiting impatiently. The door opened a crack, Yoongi standing in the way of her and the room, he looked her up and down then Daniel promptly after. </p><p>\u2018If we have to do this, I work alone, it\u2019s bad enough you have to come in here, I won\u2019t allow him too.\u2019 If she rolled her eyes one more time in the next ten minutes they would stay at the back of her head, looking over at Daniel she raised a hand shooing him away, he looked between them in bewilderment.  </p><p>\u2018Wow look at that you actually agreed on something, progress!\u2019 He mumbled walking away, Yoongi stepped aside letting her shuffle into the room. It was quite a plain little room white walls, a black leather couch behind her and his set up in front. She sat down at one end of the couch, pulling out her laptop and notebook, he sat down beside her leaning back. He was attractive, she would give him that, his side profile was quite powerful, jawline in sharp contrast to his chubby little cheeks. She gathered herself quickly remembering who she was eyeing up, there was no getting over what he did, she was probably holding a grudge over nothing, but a grudge all the same. </p><p>\u2018So do you have any thoughts on how you want this to go or\u2026?\u2019 She questioned, he rolled his head round to look at her, admiring her face, to think he used to actually be a fan, head still resting on the back of the couch, he huffed out a sigh.  </p><p>\u2018Not really, usually I see a plan, but at the moment I\u2019m unmotivated and unbothered.\u2019 He replied, turning his head back to looking at the ceiling. She stared at him dumbfounded, this fucking man. She groaned, falling back on the couch too. </p><p>\u2018Fine.\u2019 She replied bluntly, unlocking her phone going onto an app. </p><p>\u2018What are you doing now?\u2019 He grunted, she rolled her eyes. </p><p>\u2018I\u2019m ordering us food, because if we aren\u2019t going to work, I would rather eat something.\u2019 His head shot around looking her up and down, a woman after his own heart, you know despite the hating each other thing. She clicked a few buttons handing the phone to him letting him place his order, he punched in the address and his card details placing the order.  </p><p>\u2018Did you just\u2026?\u2019 She questioned, already knowing the answer.  </p><p>\u2018Pay for our meal, yes, I did.\u2019 A frown crossed her brow, did he think she couldn\u2019t afford a food order? She chucked her phone down beside her turning her body to look at him.  </p><p>\u2018Do you not think I can pay for these things myself what the hell?\u2019 He looked at her stunned, he stood up from his place beside her slamming himself down in his computer chair.  </p><p>\u2018Are you really about to pick a fight? All I did was do something nice, Jesus.\u2019 He spun around looking intently at his screen trying to find a beat for this stupid song. She took a twenty out her purse slamming it down beside him.  </p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t need your charity, I\u2019m going down to wait for the food.\u2019 With that she swiftly walked out of the room, slamming the door behind her. He sighed and winced slightly waiting for his glass door to break at the force of the slam, he looked down at the money frowning, why could she not just apologise, why could he not just say sorry? No she started this, there was no way he was going to be the first to cave.  </p><p>\u2018Daniel he is insufferable, I can\u2019t do this!\u2019 She spoke through the phone, he had apparently went out to get food himself clearly happy with the knowledge they hadn\u2019t murdered each other yet.  </p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sure its not that bad you\u2019re just being dramatic as always.\u2019 She practically fizzed, he wasn\u2019t in the room, he didn\u2019t know how full of himself he was, this was hopeless.  </p><p>\u2018The contract isn\u2019t worth this I can\u2019t do it I-\u2018  </p><p>\u2018The uh, the food came straight to my studio, it\u2019s waiting when you\u2019re ready.\u2019 He spoke carefully, trying not to anger her more. Nodding briefly she turned away from him ending the call promptly.  </p><p>\u2018I have to go, but I\u2019m telling you this is a lost cause.\u2019 Before he had a time to answer she hung up the call, taking the path back to the small room she was going to spend 90% of her days in until the terms of this damn contract were completed. He sat on the floor already digging into the food he had ordered, hers still sitting in the boxes, she took the place across from him opening them. He looked at her for a good minute before opening his mouth to speak, she seemed calm for the time being.  </p><p>\u2018Why do you hate me so much?\u2019 He questioned, tone slightly more upset and hurt than he wanted it to come out. She looked up at him, eyes practically bugging out her head, noodles resting between her lips. He giggled at her stunned expression, she snapped out of it chewing the noodles and staring at him confused.  </p><p>\u2018I\u2026what?\u2019 At this point she really didn\u2019t have words, or at least words he wanted to hear, he tilted his head slightly to the left, placing his utensils down giving her his full attention.  </p><p>\u2018Why do you hate me, I didn\u2019t even know you before, but you just decided you hated me, why?\u2019 His tone was not accusatory, he looked and sounded more like a kicked puppy, whiney and pouty, her heart thumped in her chest a little bit faster, god he looked so adorable.  </p><p>\u2018I never hated you, I just don\u2019t understand-\u2018 She cut herself off, confused for a second. \u2018Wait before what?\u2019 He rolled his eyes, god he hated people who played dumb.

She clicked a few buttons handing the phone to him letting him place his order, he punched in the address and his card details placing the order.  </p><p>&lsquo;Did you just&hellip;?&rsquo; She questioned, already knowing the answer.  </p><p>&lsquo;Pay for our meal, yes, I did.&rsquo; A frown crossed her brow, did he think she couldn&rsquo;t afford a food order? She chucked her phone down beside her turning her body to look at him.  </p><p>&lsquo;Do you not think I can pay for these things myself what the hell?&rsquo; He looked at her stunned, he stood up from his place beside her slamming himself down in his computer chair.  </p><p>&lsquo;Are you really about to pick a fight? All I did was do something nice, Jesus.&rsquo; He spun around looking intently at his screen trying to find a beat for this stupid song. She took a twenty out her purse slamming it down beside him.  </p><p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t need your charity, I&rsquo;m going down to wait for the food.&rsquo; With that she swiftly walked out of the room, slamming the door behind her. He sighed and winced slightly waiting for his glass door to break at the force of the slam, he looked down at the money frowning, why could she not just apologise, why could he not just say sorry? No she started this, there was no way he was going to be the first to cave.  </p><p>&lsquo;Daniel he is insufferable, I can&rsquo;t do this!&rsquo; She spoke through the phone, he had apparently went out to get food himself clearly happy with the knowledge they hadn&rsquo;t murdered each other yet.  </p><p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure its not that bad you&rsquo;re just being dramatic as always.&rsquo; She practically fizzed, he wasn&rsquo;t in the room, he didn&rsquo;t know how full of himself he was, this was hopeless.  </p><p>&lsquo;The contract isn&rsquo;t worth this I can&rsquo;t do it I-&lsquo;  </p><p>&lsquo;The uh, the food came straight to my studio, it&rsquo;s waiting when you&rsquo;re ready.&rsquo; He spoke carefully, trying not to anger her more. Nodding briefly she turned away from him ending the call promptly.  </p><p>&lsquo;I have to go, but I&rsquo;m telling you this is a lost cause.&rsquo; Before he had a time to answer she hung up the call, taking the path back to the small room she was going to spend 90% of her days in until the terms of this damn contract were completed. He sat on the floor already digging into the food he had ordered, hers still sitting in the boxes, she took the place across from him opening them. He looked at her for a good minute before opening his mouth to speak, she seemed calm for the time being.  </p><p>&lsquo;Why do you hate me so much?&rsquo; He questioned, tone slightly more upset and hurt than he wanted it to come out. She looked up at him, eyes practically bugging out her head, noodles resting between her lips. He giggled at her stunned expression, she snapped out of it chewing the noodles and staring at him confused.  </p><p>&lsquo;I&hellip;what?&rsquo; At this point she really didn&rsquo;t have words, or at least words he wanted to hear, he tilted his head slightly to the left, placing his utensils down giving her his full attention.  </p><p>&lsquo;Why do you hate me, I didn&rsquo;t even know you before, but you just decided you hated me, why?&rsquo; His tone was not accusatory, he looked and sounded more like a kicked puppy, whiney and pouty, her heart thumped in her chest a little bit faster, god he looked so adorable.  </p><p>&lsquo;I never hated you, I just don&rsquo;t understand-&lsquo; She cut herself off, confused for a second. &lsquo;Wait before what?&rsquo; He rolled his eyes, god he hated people who played dumb. He took out his phone googling her song and placing it down in front of her, she cringed internally, god this was the worst song she had ever made. She pressed the pause button, pulled a face and handed him back his phone.  </p><p>&lsquo;Okay I get it, it&rsquo;s a shit song, but what does that have to do with anything?&rsquo; He sighed, maybe she was just stupid, like maybe it was a medical condition because there is no way.  </p><p>&lsquo;Do you really not know? Like for real?&rsquo; She shrugged, still way beyond the point of confused.  </p><p>&lsquo;I mean I know you made a diss track about me, that&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t like you but I still don&rsquo;t know why you have such a problem with me.&rsquo; She replied so nonchalantly, if he was standing it would have knocked him into a seat. He sat there, mouth falling open just to close again, he figured he resembled something like a puffer fish but couldn&rsquo;t find it within himself to care.  </p><p>&lsquo;WHAT!?&rsquo; He screamed, there was no way this was happening. &lsquo;I only made that track because you made this one!&rsquo; He yelled pointing at the phone screen, she looked between him and the phone, suddenly bursting out in a hearty laughter.  </p><p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re so CUTE! That wasn&rsquo;t about you it was about my ex, what in heavens name made you think it was about you, I didn&rsquo;t even know who you were!&rsquo; He blushed, flustered and embarrassed, of course she didn&rsquo;t know him why would she? </p><p>&lsquo;Oh uh, nothing it just, it had one of my lyrics in it, I thought you were having a dig at me, oh man this is embarrassing&hellip;&rsquo; He spoke avoiding eye contact at every possible moment, she giggled again, coming around to his side. Lifting his head up with two fingers under his chin, she forced his eyes onto her face.  </p><p>&lsquo;If it helps you any, I thought you looked really cute as you shit talked me, and you&rsquo;re really hot when angry.&rsquo; She spoke creating tension before moving away quickly, straight back to shoveling noodles into her mouth.  </p><p>&lsquo;You are insufferable, I hope you realise.&rsquo; She smirked nodding, as he also went back to his noodles.  </p><p>&lsquo;I get that a lot, don&rsquo;t worry.&rsquo; There was silence for a while both of them finishing up their food, they cleaned up both settling down beside each other to begin this song.  </p><p>&lsquo;So if you didn&rsquo;t know who I was, how did you know about my track?&rsquo; He questioned a couple hours into working, she looked over at him putting her pen down.  </p><p>&lsquo;My friend is a big fan, she recognized some hints towards me and showed me, I&rsquo;ve listened to it a few times actually, it&rsquo;s quite smart to be fair.&rsquo; She spoke tearing the page out of the notebook, letting him read it. He shrugged, crossing out a few lines keeping the ones that he liked or made sense to him leaving her to figure out the rest.  </p><p>&lsquo;This is taking a lot longer than I expected, it&rsquo;s late maybe we should call it a night?&rsquo; He looked over at her as she flopped into the couch, he nodded, she did look exhausted.  </p><p>&lsquo;Sure, is your hotel far from here? I could give you a lift?&rsquo; He proposed, she looked at him and shook her head.  </p><p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s okay it&rsquo;s really quite far out, I don&rsquo;t want to inconvenience you further.&rsquo; He frowned, why would she get a hotel so far away from the only place she really HAD to be?  </p><p>&lsquo;Well seeing as we are working on this song together, how about you stay with me, I&rsquo;ll probably be in the home studio all night, that way if inspiration strikes you can come help? How&rsquo;s that sound?&rsquo; She smirked, gathering her things, she stood up from the chair, holding her hand out to him she smiled warmly.  </p><p>&lsquo;I accept, but that bed better be the best thing I&rsquo;ve slept on for that diss track.&rsquo; He sighed, taking her hand anyway.  </p><p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve changed my mind, you can stay away from my house, to think I was going to give you my bed.&rsquo; He chuckled casually wrapping an arm around her shoulders.</p></p>",
