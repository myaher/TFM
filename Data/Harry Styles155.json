The second thing he notices is that she\u2019s standing across from a guy with her cheeks pink and smile bright. He stands there for a few minutes, heart in his throat as he stares at the girl whose heart he\u2019d broken, only to break his own with her.<b><br/></b></p><p>She looks happy he notes, watching as she throws her head back and laughs openly at something the man said. He grins at her reaction, a smug smile settling on his lips as he watches her. Harry feels his stomach churn at the interaction. He can\u2019t remember the last time Jazz had laughed like that around him.</p><p>He wonders if she\u2019ll ever laugh like that around him again because no matter what happened or how much time passed, Harry still wasn\u2019t able to accept that Jazz was gone for good.</p><p>Ever since Zayn had reminded him of her art show Harry had been restless. He\u2019d found a new found purpose, a lead on how to see - and hopefully win back - Jazz again. And he wasn\u2019t going to let some guy stand in his way.</p><p>He was hurt, there was no denying it. He hadn\u2019t thought Jazz would be able to move on from him so quickly - or maybe he\u2019d hoped she wouldn\u2019t be able to. He doesn\u2019t know if that makes him a bad person or not (he already knew he was a bad boyfriend), but he thinks it probably does.</p><p>And he\u2019s angry too, he finds. Underneath all the hurt and guilt, Harry feels a bubbling anger - at himself, at the guy who now had his hand resting gently on Jazz\u2019s arm, at <i>Jazz</i>. She\u2019d promised him she\u2019d never leave him, hadn\u2019t she? That she\u2019d never give up on them; <i>on him.</i> But there she was, laughing and smiling at a man that wasn\u2019t him while Harry felt himself drift further and further away.</p><p>He loves her <i>so much</i>. Can\u2019t imagine his world without her. He wonders when things changed between them, when he\u2019d taken her presence for granted and started ignoring the way she\u2019d always made his day better even when they fought and argued. Jazz had always had a rule - no matter how mad they were at each other, no matter what they were doing or where they were,<i> they always said I love you at least once a day.</i></p><p>With a jolt he realises he can\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d said those words to her, can\u2019t even remember the last time he\u2019s said anything remotely affectionate to her.</p><p>He pulls out his phone and opens up his messages immediately searching for Jazz\u2019s name. He finds her almost instantly, she was always at the top of his recent contacts, and feels what\u2019s left of his heart squeeze in on itself.</p><p>There were messages after messages that he\u2019d ignored from her, scattered \u2018I love you\u2019s and \u2018where are you\u2019s that he had paid no mind to. The questions and worried messages and missed calls had eventually tapered out, but the \u2018I love you\u2019s continued to come through all the way until the night he\u2019d last seen her.</p><p>Harry has tried to text and call her multiple times since then but either she\u2019s blocked his number (which he can\u2019t blame her for), or she\u2019s ignoring him the same way he\u2019d ignored her (which he can\u2019t blame her for <i>either</i>).</p><p>He rubs a tired hand over his face and chews on his lower lip. His fingers twitch and he clenches his hand into a fist beside his side. He wants to call her, wants to see if she really is screening all his calls. But he doesn\u2019t think he can stomach seeing her actively ignore him.</p><p>The man standing in front of her is making her smile again and Harry envisions - just for a second - what their life might be like together. He tries to stop the thought before it can fully form but it\u2019s too late and he\u2019s seeing white fences and a dog in the yard and children with Jazz\u2019s smile and blonde hair like her <i>companions</i>; and it all looks wrong.</p><p>The house is meant to be on hill in the countryside overlooking a huge garden with a shed at the back filled with art supplies and more than one puppy running around. The kids are meant to have curly brown hair and green eyes that glint in the sun as they run around screaming and giggling while their dad chases them. There are cats lounging on the porch while Jazz strokes them, a fond smile tugging on her lips as she watches her family plant flowers and herbs.</p><p>Harry shakes himself out of his thoughts and before he knows it, he\u2019s making his way over to the woman who holds his future in his hands. He wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d ever be able to move on from her, not when he\u2019s planned their whole future together. He\u2019d even gone looking for a damn ring last year, ready to ask her to marry him. And then he\u2019d gone and fucked it all up instead.</p><p>The man she\u2019d been standing with is gone Harry notes and he feels a sense of relief that he hadn\u2019t seen them part ways. He wasn\u2019t sure what he would have done if he\u2019d seen him kiss his girl goodbye.</p><p>\u201cJasmine,\u201d he chokes out once he\u2019s close enough, once he\u2019s walked through the door and the bell above his head chimes his arrival, once she turns around and sees him standing there her eyes wide and posture stiff.</p><p>Harry waits and waits for her to say something, anything, but all Jazz does is stand there and stare at him and Harry imagines she\u2019s drinking him in the way he is doing to her. Her cheeks are flushed pink and Harry can\u2019t help but wonder if the man from before put them there. His gut churns.</p><p>He swallows roughly and it feels as though there\u2019s a stone lodged deep in his oesophagus keeping him from speaking.</p><p>He wants to tell her he loves her, he wants to tell her he\u2019s sorry, he wants to beg her to come <i>home</i>.</p><p>But instead, he just stands there staring. A broken man with a broken heart and the only girl he thinks can ever make him whole again standing in front of him chewing her bottom lip raw.</p><p>Harry takes in the sight of her full pink lip disappearing between her teeth and finally finds he can\u2019t stay away from her any longer. He practically lunges towards her too quickly and too slowly all at the same time. He doesn\u2019t want to spook her but staying away from her for even another second is too much. <i>What if she disappears again?</i></p><p>\u201cJazz,\u201d he whispers when he\u2019s close enough, watching the way her lashes flutter shut and the breath stutters out of her, like she\u2019d been holding her breath and hadn\u2019t even realised it. Harry studies her closely, fingers twitching as he notes the darkness under her eyes. \u201cYou look tired,\u201d he says his eyes cataloguing every little change he sees in her.</p><p>\u201cHarry.\u201d</p><p>His name whispered on her lips is worse than a punch to the gut and he feels like he won\u2019t ever be able to breathe again unless he hears it again and again and again for the rest of his life.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d forgotten how sweet she sounded, how her laugh used to echo around their flat when everything was too quiet and tense and he needed something to calm him down.</p><p>He reaches out to her this time, his palm resting on her cheek as he strokes along under her eyes. \u201cI miss you.\u201d</p><p>She leans into him, her eyes fluttering shut as her breath puffs out across his wrist.</p><p>He stands still, unwilling to move away but worried that she\u2019ll push him off if he tries to bring her closer. Instead he takes in a deep breath, trying to breathe her <i>in, in, in.</i></p><p>She smells like watermelons and he wonders if she tastes the same, his eyes sinking to her lips and the way they shone in the glow of the studio lights. He knows she\u2019s prone to overusing her lip balm when she\u2019s stressed, swiping it across her lips almost every half an hour. He\u2019s seen her go through more than one tube a week and fallen into the habit of always having a few sitting spare at home.</p><p>\u201cDid Zayn tell you I was here?\u201d she asks him, and Harry is finally able to look away from her lips. He can\u2019t help but note that she\u2019s avoided responding to his confession and as hurt as he is, he knows that he can\u2019t blame her for it.</p><p>\u201cI had to force it out of him,\u201d he nods at her. They\u2019re still standing inches from each other and she still hasn\u2019t pushed him away and Harry is taking that as a good sign.</p><p>\u201cI doubt it would have taken much prodding.\u201d She winces as the words come out a little sharper than she\u2019d intended. \u201cHe\u2019s never been very good at keeping secrets,\u201d she adds.</p><p>\u201cEspecially when he thinks he\u2019s right,\u201d Harry joins in.</p><p>It\u2019s awkward.</p><p>Neither of them know what to say and neither of them seem to be willing to pull away.</p><p>Harry\u2019s still trying to take all of her in, trying to note any changes in the month they had spent apart. She\u2019s thinner and looks more tired and nervous and her eyes don\u2019t shine the way he\u2019s always used to, but she still looks like Jazz and he still thinks she\u2019s perfect.</p><p>Jazz can\u2019t help taking him in either. She looks at him and sees her past and future all entwined together and she doesn\u2019t know how to pull them apart.</p><p>She wants to be strong, wants to push him away and tell him that no, she doesn\u2019t care that he misses her, that he should have remembered that before he had treated her so mean.</p><p>But she can\u2019t.</p><p>She can\u2019t because despite what he\u2019s done, he\u2019s still standing in front of her with his eyes once again honest and kind and all kinds of hurt and she wonders if maybe he sees the same in hers.</p><p>Zayn\u2019s been telling her she needs to come home through texts she never answers, to forgive him at least a little bit because he\u2019s not been doing very well. She hadn\u2019t wanted to believe him at first, and she\u2019d hated herself for hoping it was true for the longest time afterwards as well. Now as she looks up at him as he tells her he misses her, she sees that it was true and she doesn\u2019t feel the satisfaction she thought she would have at the idea she wasn\u2019t the only one suffering. She just feels sad.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t know how they ended up here, two pieces of a broken puzzle that have no right fitting together anymore. But they do. They always will, she thinks.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here, Harry?\u201d she asks eventually, finally shifting away from him.</p><p>They both feel the loss instantly, a sudden chill running down both their spines.</p><p>Harry tucks his hands deep into his pockets, digging into the skin of his thighs to keep from reaching out for her again.</p><p>\u201cI want you to come home,\u201d he tells her without hesitation. He thinks it should be more said more eloquently as soon as the words are past his lips but it\u2019s too late and as blunt as they may be, he\u2019s spoken the truth. He just hopes that Jazz can see that.</p><p>He panics when he sees her look away from him. When she bites her lips and looks over his shoulder and out the door. He wonders if she\u2019s thinking about the man who was in here before him and he feels the panic rise to his throat like bile as he imagines her with someone else.</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d he forces out. \u201cI love you.\u201d And as he looks at her and sees the way her eyes widen a little and her shoulders drop at those words, he realises just how long it has been since he\u2019s said them to her. So he repeats them and silently vows to himself to say them every chance he gets for as long as she\u2019ll have him. Even if it is just for the next few minutes before she tells him she\u2019s met someone else. \u201cI love you.\u201d He says again, firmer. \u201cSo please, come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI \u2013 I dunno if I can,\u201d she confesses and she still won\u2019t look at him and Harry feels like he can\u2019t breathe. \u201cThere\u2019s this space between us and I don\u2019t know how to close it. I don\u2019t know if we can.\u201d She doesn\u2019t really mean it when she says that, doesn\u2019t want it to be true either. But she\u2019s started to doubt their relationship, she\u2019s started to doubt Harry and she thinks a part of her still wants to hurt him for that.</p><p>\u201cOf course you can,\u201d Harry says urgently, taking a step closer to her. She was too far away. Always too far. \u201cYou and me Jazz, we belong together, we always will. Together we can take over the whole damn world if we wanted to.\u201d</p><p>And she believes him. She believes him because he\u2019s Harry and she knows that a part of her \u2013 <i>most of her </i>\u2013 will always love him.</p><p>\u201cRemember?\u201d he steps closer to her, eyes flicking all over her face as he tries to read her. He hates that he\u2019s finding it so difficult now. He\u2019s never found it so difficult before. \u201cYou said you\u2019d never give up on us.\u201d And he knows he sounds accusatory, that she had every right to leave him. But he\u2019s still hurt and he\u2019s still in love with her and if he doesn\u2019t tell her everything now he knows he\u2019ll never forgive himself.</p><p>Jazz looks at him then, meets his gaze straight on and Harry\u2019s finally able to read her again but he wishes he wasn\u2019t, because when she looks at him now she looks nervous and afraid and unsure. Something she\u2019s not been with him since she\u2019d first introduced him to her family.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t look at me like that please. Don\u2019t look at me like it\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve met all over again.\u201d</p><p>Jazz doesn\u2019t say anything and he steels himself to having his heart broken. But when it doesn\u2019t come and she continues to look at him still, he promises himself that he\u2019ll do anything he can to make sure she never looks at him like that again.</p><p>Jazz sees the moment the resolve sets in his eyes like a curtain opening up to let the sun in and she thinks back to when they first met, when she\u2019d told her family about him. She thinks about how her parents had been worried that she wouldn\u2019t be able to handle being in a relationship with someone who was constantly in the spotlight and she remembers telling Harry as much.</p><p>He\u2019d taken her face between his hands and kissed every inch of worry away with his lips and then promised that he\u2019d change their mind. He\u2019d had the same look in his eyes then that he does now and she knows without a doubt that he would\u2019ve spent the rest of his life trying to make sure he kept his promise.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t needed to.</p><p>Her parents had loved him almost as much as she did, and even when she\u2019d gone to them after the fight she\u2019d had with Harry a month ago, they\u2019d still urged her to go back and talk it through with him. <i>\u2018That boy would burn himself to the ground trying to bring you the sun if you asked him to\u2019</i> her mum had told her.</p><p>\u201cJazz?\u201d he calls out to her, and when she blinks she realises he\u2019s looking at her worriedly. \u201cAre you ok? Your eyes glazed over a little there. Have you been drinking enough water? Are you feeling ok?\u201d His hands flutter by his sides before he gives in and reaches out to feel her head for a temperature.</p><p>He looks so worried about her that she can\u2019t help it. She leans up and kisses him.</p><p>Harry\u2019s entire body goes slack at the contact and wonders how he\u2019s managed to be apart from her for so long without falling completely to pieces. When she pulls away from him, it\u2019s too soon and he feels himself starting to unravel again but he just barely holds himself together. There were more important things to worry about right now.</p><p>\u201cDoes this mean you\u2019ll come home?\u201d he asks her, breathes on her, really. He hasn\u2019t moved away and neither has she and their lips have barely separated from one another. He can feel whispers of her kiss with every word he utters as his lips skim along hers and their breath mingles together. With her so close, he feels as though he\u2019s got a part of himself back.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she nods and Harry swears she moves even closer and his heart swells. \u201cI\u2019ve been miserable without you,\u201d she confesses, whispers it across his lips like a secret only meant for him and he kisses her again. Harder, deeper and infinitely more desperate. There\u2019s over a month of kisses he has to make up for.</p><p>A flash of blonde hair and Jazz laughing crosses his mind and he thinks of the man who was in here earlier, his hands on her arms and a fond smile on his lips and he wonders if maybe someone else had already been kissing her while he was waiting for her to come home.</p><p>He pulls away from her and instantly regrets it when Jazz tries to chase his lips. But his stomach has dropped and his mood has plummeted and he wonders if maybe they had been broken up this past month and not just giving each other space.</p><p>\u201cI \u2013 that man,\u201d he scratches at the back of his neck roughly. He doesn\u2019t know what to say. How to say it. So he just speaks without thinking about the words flowing past his lips. \u201cThere was a man in here earlier,\u201d he starts. \u201cWho was he?\u201d he thinks he sounds a little angry but he can\u2019t help it. He\u2019s nervous and jealous and the idea of another man putting his hands on his Jasmine makes Harry see red.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t normally a jealous person. But Jazz was <i>his</i>.</p><p>\u201cMan?\u201d Jazz tilts her head, tries to move closer to him once more and looks hurt when he steps back again. \u201cWhat man?\u201d</p><p>Harry feels angry suddenly. He\u2019d <i>seen</i> them standing together, much like he and Jazz were right now. Was she trying to lie to him? Did she think he\u2019d leave her if he found out she\u2019d moved on so quickly? Fat chance. Harry narrowed his eyes at the thought. He\u2019d fight tooth and nail for her. take on the whole damn world and turn it to ashes to win her back.</p><p>\u201cThere was a man in here earlier, Jazz. I saw him standing exactly the way we are right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d she grins when she realises who he\u2019s talking about. Body slumping with relief. \u201cYou mean Matt.\u201d</p><p>Harry already hates him. Hates the way she smiles when she says his name. Hates that she ever said it in the first place. \u201cI guess so. The one who was touching you too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouching me?\u201d she blinks at him and the confusion is back.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Harry nods vigorously. \u201cHe had his hand on your arm and you were laughing at something he\u2019d said. If he\u2019s a client it wasn\u2019t very professional,\u201d he adds, he sounds pouty and superior all at once and Jazz wants to hug him and kiss him and hit him all at once.</p><p>But then she realises what he\u2019s saying and suddenly Jazz is laughing at him and Harry\u2019s torn between watching her with awe and pulling his hair out because this was <i>serious</i>.</p><p>\u201cHarry, are you jealous?\u201d she asks him, once her laughter had turned to giggles and she once again took a step closer to him. This time he stays where he is.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Yes.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d she quirks a brow. \u201cSo if I were to tell you I have plans this weekend to grab dinner with Matt, you\u2019d be ok with that?\u201d</p><p>Harry couldn\u2019t stop the growl that escaped his lips if he tried and he doesn\u2019t think he wants to. The very idea of Jazz with someone else has him seeing red and all he wants to do is grab hold of her and lock her away in a tower like Rapunzel with only each other for company. He really likes the idea of that.</p><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019m a little jealous,\u201d he admits, reaching out and entwining their hands together. \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of you with someone else. But\u2026 I \u2013 I don\u2019t blame you if you\u2019ve found someone who treated you the way you deserved.\u201d He forces the words past his lips and even tries to mean them but his heart still clenches at the thought and he thinks that it may very well stop if she agrees.</p><p>\u201cMatt\u2019s my cousin, you silly goose,\u201d she bumps his shoulder fondly. \u201cHe\u2019s in the city for the weekend and wanted to grab dinner before he left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Harry grins down at her sheepishly. \u201cCan I come?\u201d</p><p>Jazz lets out a loud, happy laugh and pulls him towards the door. \u201cCome on, Harry, let\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might never let you leave,\u201d he warns her only half jokingly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hold you to that,\u201d she warns him, her heart full once again. Harry pulls her to him and plants a kiss wherever his lips land and continues to do so every couple of steps on the way home \u2013 her lips, her hair, her nose, her cheeks \u2013 every inch of her face was covered in soft kisses and every kiss was followed by an \u2018I love you\u2019.</p><p>They don\u2019t notice the flashes as pictures are taken and fans whisper about why the couple looks so happy together. And when Jazz shows him an article that Zayn had linked her with a series of question marks and a confused congratulations \u2013 the headline read that they were engaged \u2013 Harry laughs along with Jazz. He ignores the emails and phone calls his agent sends him about putting out a statement (there\u2019s no point denying it when he\u2019s already started ring shopping) and continues to spend the rest of the week couped up inside his flat with his girlfriend, mentally planning their future together.</p><p><b>AN: AND DAS THE END MY PEEPS.

The second thing he notices is that she\u2019s standing across from a guy with her cheeks pink and smile bright. He stands there for a few minutes, heart in his throat as he stares at the girl whose heart he\u2019d broken, only to break his own with her.<b><br></b></p><p>She looks happy he notes, watching as she throws her head back and laughs openly at something the man said. He grins at her reaction, a smug smile settling on his lips as he watches her. Harry feels his stomach churn at the interaction. He can\u2019t remember the last time Jazz had laughed like that around him.</p><p>He wonders if she\u2019ll ever laugh like that around him again because no matter what happened or how much time passed, Harry still wasn\u2019t able to accept that Jazz was gone for good.</p><p>Ever since Zayn had reminded him of her art show Harry had been restless. He\u2019d found a new found purpose, a lead on how to see - and hopefully win back - Jazz again. And he wasn\u2019t going to let some guy stand in his way.</p><p>He was hurt, there was no denying it. He hadn\u2019t thought Jazz would be able to move on from him so quickly - or maybe he\u2019d hoped she wouldn\u2019t be able to. He doesn\u2019t know if that makes him a bad person or not (he already knew he was a bad boyfriend), but he thinks it probably does.</p><p>And he\u2019s angry too, he finds. Underneath all the hurt and guilt, Harry feels a bubbling anger - at himself, at the guy who now had his hand resting gently on Jazz\u2019s arm, at <i>Jazz</i>. She\u2019d promised him she\u2019d never leave him, hadn\u2019t she? That she\u2019d never give up on them; <i>on him.</i> But there she was, laughing and smiling at a man that wasn\u2019t him while Harry felt himself drift further and further away.</p><p>He loves her <i>so much</i>. Can\u2019t imagine his world without her. He wonders when things changed between them, when he\u2019d taken her presence for granted and started ignoring the way she\u2019d always made his day better even when they fought and argued. Jazz had always had a rule - no matter how mad they were at each other, no matter what they were doing or where they were,<i> they always said I love you at least once a day.</i></p><p>With a jolt he realises he can\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d said those words to her, can\u2019t even remember the last time he\u2019s said anything remotely affectionate to her.</p><p>He pulls out his phone and opens up his messages immediately searching for Jazz\u2019s name. He finds her almost instantly, she was always at the top of his recent contacts, and feels what\u2019s left of his heart squeeze in on itself.</p><p>There were messages after messages that he\u2019d ignored from her, scattered \u2018I love you\u2019s and \u2018where are you\u2019s that he had paid no mind to. The questions and worried messages and missed calls had eventually tapered out, but the \u2018I love you\u2019s continued to come through all the way until the night he\u2019d last seen her.</p><p>Harry has tried to text and call her multiple times since then but either she\u2019s blocked his number (which he can\u2019t blame her for), or she\u2019s ignoring him the same way he\u2019d ignored her (which he can\u2019t blame her for <i>either</i>).</p><p>He rubs a tired hand over his face and chews on his lower lip. His fingers twitch and he clenches his hand into a fist beside his side. He wants to call her, wants to see if she really is screening all his calls. But he doesn\u2019t think he can stomach seeing her actively ignore him.</p><p>The man standing in front of her is making her smile again and Harry envisions - just for a second - what their life might be like together. He tries to stop the thought before it can fully form but it\u2019s too late and he\u2019s seeing white fences and a dog in the yard and children with Jazz\u2019s smile and blonde hair like her <i>companions</i>; and it all looks wrong.</p><p>The house is meant to be on hill in the countryside overlooking a huge garden with a shed at the back filled with art supplies and more than one puppy running around. The kids are meant to have curly brown hair and green eyes that glint in the sun as they run around screaming and giggling while their dad chases them. There are cats lounging on the porch while Jazz strokes them, a fond smile tugging on her lips as she watches her family plant flowers and herbs.</p><p>Harry shakes himself out of his thoughts and before he knows it, he\u2019s making his way over to the woman who holds his future in his hands. He wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d ever be able to move on from her, not when he\u2019s planned their whole future together. He\u2019d even gone looking for a damn ring last year, ready to ask her to marry him. And then he\u2019d gone and fucked it all up instead.</p><p>The man she\u2019d been standing with is gone Harry notes and he feels a sense of relief that he hadn\u2019t seen them part ways. He wasn\u2019t sure what he would have done if he\u2019d seen him kiss his girl goodbye.</p><p>\u201cJasmine,\u201d he chokes out once he\u2019s close enough, once he\u2019s walked through the door and the bell above his head chimes his arrival, once she turns around and sees him standing there her eyes wide and posture stiff.</p><p>Harry waits and waits for her to say something, anything, but all Jazz does is stand there and stare at him and Harry imagines she\u2019s drinking him in the way he is doing to her. Her cheeks are flushed pink and Harry can\u2019t help but wonder if the man from before put them there. His gut churns.</p><p>He swallows roughly and it feels as though there\u2019s a stone lodged deep in his oesophagus keeping him from speaking.</p><p>He wants to tell her he loves her, he wants to tell her he\u2019s sorry, he wants to beg her to come <i>home</i>.</p><p>But instead, he just stands there staring. A broken man with a broken heart and the only girl he thinks can ever make him whole again standing in front of him chewing her bottom lip raw.</p><p>Harry takes in the sight of her full pink lip disappearing between her teeth and finally finds he can\u2019t stay away from her any longer. He practically lunges towards her too quickly and too slowly all at the same time. He doesn\u2019t want to spook her but staying away from her for even another second is too much. <i>What if she disappears again?</i></p><p>\u201cJazz,\u201d he whispers when he\u2019s close enough, watching the way her lashes flutter shut and the breath stutters out of her, like she\u2019d been holding her breath and hadn\u2019t even realised it. Harry studies her closely, fingers twitching as he notes the darkness under her eyes. \u201cYou look tired,\u201d he says his eyes cataloguing every little change he sees in her.</p><p>\u201cHarry.\u201d</p><p>His name whispered on her lips is worse than a punch to the gut and he feels like he won\u2019t ever be able to breathe again unless he hears it again and again and again for the rest of his life.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d forgotten how sweet she sounded, how her laugh used to echo around their flat when everything was too quiet and tense and he needed something to calm him down.</p><p>He reaches out to her this time, his palm resting on her cheek as he strokes along under her eyes. \u201cI miss you.\u201d</p><p>She leans into him, her eyes fluttering shut as her breath puffs out across his wrist.</p><p>He stands still, unwilling to move away but worried that she\u2019ll push him off if he tries to bring her closer. Instead he takes in a deep breath, trying to breathe her <i>in, in, in.</i></p><p>She smells like watermelons and he wonders if she tastes the same, his eyes sinking to her lips and the way they shone in the glow of the studio lights. He knows she\u2019s prone to overusing her lip balm when she\u2019s stressed, swiping it across her lips almost every half an hour. He\u2019s seen her go through more than one tube a week and fallen into the habit of always having a few sitting spare at home.</p><p>\u201cDid Zayn tell you I was here?\u201d she asks him, and Harry is finally able to look away from her lips. He can\u2019t help but note that she\u2019s avoided responding to his confession and as hurt as he is, he knows that he can\u2019t blame her for it.</p><p>\u201cI had to force it out of him,\u201d he nods at her. They\u2019re still standing inches from each other and she still hasn\u2019t pushed him away and Harry is taking that as a good sign.</p><p>\u201cI doubt it would have taken much prodding.\u201d She winces as the words come out a little sharper than she\u2019d intended. \u201cHe\u2019s never been very good at keeping secrets,\u201d she adds.</p><p>\u201cEspecially when he thinks he\u2019s right,\u201d Harry joins in.</p><p>It\u2019s awkward.</p><p>Neither of them know what to say and neither of them seem to be willing to pull away.</p><p>Harry\u2019s still trying to take all of her in, trying to note any changes in the month they had spent apart. She\u2019s thinner and looks more tired and nervous and her eyes don\u2019t shine the way he\u2019s always used to, but she still looks like Jazz and he still thinks she\u2019s perfect.</p><p>Jazz can\u2019t help taking him in either. She looks at him and sees her past and future all entwined together and she doesn\u2019t know how to pull them apart.</p><p>She wants to be strong, wants to push him away and tell him that no, she doesn\u2019t care that he misses her, that he should have remembered that before he had treated her so mean.</p><p>But she can\u2019t.</p><p>She can\u2019t because despite what he\u2019s done, he\u2019s still standing in front of her with his eyes once again honest and kind and all kinds of hurt and she wonders if maybe he sees the same in hers.</p><p>Zayn\u2019s been telling her she needs to come home through texts she never answers, to forgive him at least a little bit because he\u2019s not been doing very well. She hadn\u2019t wanted to believe him at first, and she\u2019d hated herself for hoping it was true for the longest time afterwards as well. Now as she looks up at him as he tells her he misses her, she sees that it was true and she doesn\u2019t feel the satisfaction she thought she would have at the idea she wasn\u2019t the only one suffering. She just feels sad.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t know how they ended up here, two pieces of a broken puzzle that have no right fitting together anymore. But they do. They always will, she thinks.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here, Harry?\u201d she asks eventually, finally shifting away from him.</p><p>They both feel the loss instantly, a sudden chill running down both their spines.</p><p>Harry tucks his hands deep into his pockets, digging into the skin of his thighs to keep from reaching out for her again.</p><p>\u201cI want you to come home,\u201d he tells her without hesitation. He thinks it should be more said more eloquently as soon as the words are past his lips but it\u2019s too late and as blunt as they may be, he\u2019s spoken the truth. He just hopes that Jazz can see that.</p><p>He panics when he sees her look away from him. When she bites her lips and looks over his shoulder and out the door. He wonders if she\u2019s thinking about the man who was in here before him and he feels the panic rise to his throat like bile as he imagines her with someone else.</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d he forces out. \u201cI love you.\u201d And as he looks at her and sees the way her eyes widen a little and her shoulders drop at those words, he realises just how long it has been since he\u2019s said them to her. So he repeats them and silently vows to himself to say them every chance he gets for as long as she\u2019ll have him. Even if it is just for the next few minutes before she tells him she\u2019s met someone else. \u201cI love you.\u201d He says again, firmer. \u201cSo please, come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI \u2013 I dunno if I can,\u201d she confesses and she still won\u2019t look at him and Harry feels like he can\u2019t breathe. \u201cThere\u2019s this space between us and I don\u2019t know how to close it. I don\u2019t know if we can.\u201d She doesn\u2019t really mean it when she says that, doesn\u2019t want it to be true either. But she\u2019s started to doubt their relationship, she\u2019s started to doubt Harry and she thinks a part of her still wants to hurt him for that.</p><p>\u201cOf course you can,\u201d Harry says urgently, taking a step closer to her. She was too far away. Always too far. \u201cYou and me Jazz, we belong together, we always will. Together we can take over the whole damn world if we wanted to.\u201d</p><p>And she believes him. She believes him because he\u2019s Harry and she knows that a part of her \u2013 <i>most of her </i>\u2013 will always love him.</p><p>\u201cRemember?\u201d he steps closer to her, eyes flicking all over her face as he tries to read her. He hates that he\u2019s finding it so difficult now. He\u2019s never found it so difficult before. \u201cYou said you\u2019d never give up on us.\u201d And he knows he sounds accusatory, that she had every right to leave him. But he\u2019s still hurt and he\u2019s still in love with her and if he doesn\u2019t tell her everything now he knows he\u2019ll never forgive himself.</p><p>Jazz looks at him then, meets his gaze straight on and Harry\u2019s finally able to read her again but he wishes he wasn\u2019t, because when she looks at him now she looks nervous and afraid and unsure. Something she\u2019s not been with him since she\u2019d first introduced him to her family.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t look at me like that please. Don\u2019t look at me like it\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve met all over again.\u201d</p><p>Jazz doesn\u2019t say anything and he steels himself to having his heart broken. But when it doesn\u2019t come and she continues to look at him still, he promises himself that he\u2019ll do anything he can to make sure she never looks at him like that again.</p><p>Jazz sees the moment the resolve sets in his eyes like a curtain opening up to let the sun in and she thinks back to when they first met, when she\u2019d told her family about him. She thinks about how her parents had been worried that she wouldn\u2019t be able to handle being in a relationship with someone who was constantly in the spotlight and she remembers telling Harry as much.</p><p>He\u2019d taken her face between his hands and kissed every inch of worry away with his lips and then promised that he\u2019d change their mind. He\u2019d had the same look in his eyes then that he does now and she knows without a doubt that he would\u2019ve spent the rest of his life trying to make sure he kept his promise.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t needed to.</p><p>Her parents had loved him almost as much as she did, and even when she\u2019d gone to them after the fight she\u2019d had with Harry a month ago, they\u2019d still urged her to go back and talk it through with him. <i>\u2018That boy would burn himself to the ground trying to bring you the sun if you asked him to\u2019</i> her mum had told her.</p><p>\u201cJazz?\u201d he calls out to her, and when she blinks she realises he\u2019s looking at her worriedly. \u201cAre you ok? Your eyes glazed over a little there. Have you been drinking enough water? Are you feeling ok?\u201d His hands flutter by his sides before he gives in and reaches out to feel her head for a temperature.</p><p>He looks so worried about her that she can\u2019t help it. She leans up and kisses him.</p><p>Harry\u2019s entire body goes slack at the contact and wonders how he\u2019s managed to be apart from her for so long without falling completely to pieces. When she pulls away from him, it\u2019s too soon and he feels himself starting to unravel again but he just barely holds himself together. There were more important things to worry about right now.</p><p>\u201cDoes this mean you\u2019ll come home?\u201d he asks her, breathes on her, really. He hasn\u2019t moved away and neither has she and their lips have barely separated from one another. He can feel whispers of her kiss with every word he utters as his lips skim along hers and their breath mingles together. With her so close, he feels as though he\u2019s got a part of himself back.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she nods and Harry swears she moves even closer and his heart swells. \u201cI\u2019ve been miserable without you,\u201d she confesses, whispers it across his lips like a secret only meant for him and he kisses her again. Harder, deeper and infinitely more desperate. There\u2019s over a month of kisses he has to make up for.</p><p>A flash of blonde hair and Jazz laughing crosses his mind and he thinks of the man who was in here earlier, his hands on her arms and a fond smile on his lips and he wonders if maybe someone else had already been kissing her while he was waiting for her to come home.</p><p>He pulls away from her and instantly regrets it when Jazz tries to chase his lips. But his stomach has dropped and his mood has plummeted and he wonders if maybe they had been broken up this past month and not just giving each other space.</p><p>\u201cI \u2013 that man,\u201d he scratches at the back of his neck roughly. He doesn\u2019t know what to say. How to say it. So he just speaks without thinking about the words flowing past his lips. \u201cThere was a man in here earlier,\u201d he starts. \u201cWho was he?\u201d he thinks he sounds a little angry but he can\u2019t help it. He\u2019s nervous and jealous and the idea of another man putting his hands on his Jasmine makes Harry see red.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t normally a jealous person. But Jazz was <i>his</i>.</p><p>\u201cMan?\u201d Jazz tilts her head, tries to move closer to him once more and looks hurt when he steps back again. \u201cWhat man?\u201d</p><p>Harry feels angry suddenly. He\u2019d <i>seen</i> them standing together, much like he and Jazz were right now. Was she trying to lie to him? Did she think he\u2019d leave her if he found out she\u2019d moved on so quickly? Fat chance. Harry narrowed his eyes at the thought. He\u2019d fight tooth and nail for her. take on the whole damn world and turn it to ashes to win her back.</p><p>\u201cThere was a man in here earlier, Jazz. I saw him standing exactly the way we are right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d she grins when she realises who he\u2019s talking about. Body slumping with relief. \u201cYou mean Matt.\u201d</p><p>Harry already hates him. Hates the way she smiles when she says his name. Hates that she ever said it in the first place. \u201cI guess so. The one who was touching you too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouching me?\u201d she blinks at him and the confusion is back.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Harry nods vigorously. \u201cHe had his hand on your arm and you were laughing at something he\u2019d said. If he\u2019s a client it wasn\u2019t very professional,\u201d he adds, he sounds pouty and superior all at once and Jazz wants to hug him and kiss him and hit him all at once.</p><p>But then she realises what he\u2019s saying and suddenly Jazz is laughing at him and Harry\u2019s torn between watching her with awe and pulling his hair out because this was <i>serious</i>.</p><p>\u201cHarry, are you jealous?\u201d she asks him, once her laughter had turned to giggles and she once again took a step closer to him. This time he stays where he is.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Yes.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d she quirks a brow. \u201cSo if I were to tell you I have plans this weekend to grab dinner with Matt, you\u2019d be ok with that?\u201d</p><p>Harry couldn\u2019t stop the growl that escaped his lips if he tried and he doesn\u2019t think he wants to. The very idea of Jazz with someone else has him seeing red and all he wants to do is grab hold of her and lock her away in a tower like Rapunzel with only each other for company. He really likes the idea of that.</p><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019m a little jealous,\u201d he admits, reaching out and entwining their hands together. \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of you with someone else. But\u2026 I \u2013 I don\u2019t blame you if you\u2019ve found someone who treated you the way you deserved.\u201d He forces the words past his lips and even tries to mean them but his heart still clenches at the thought and he thinks that it may very well stop if she agrees.</p><p>\u201cMatt\u2019s my cousin, you silly goose,\u201d she bumps his shoulder fondly. \u201cHe\u2019s in the city for the weekend and wanted to grab dinner before he left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Harry grins down at her sheepishly. \u201cCan I come?\u201d</p><p>Jazz lets out a loud, happy laugh and pulls him towards the door. \u201cCome on, Harry, let\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might never let you leave,\u201d he warns her only half jokingly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hold you to that,\u201d she warns him, her heart full once again. Harry pulls her to him and plants a kiss wherever his lips land and continues to do so every couple of steps on the way home \u2013 her lips, her hair, her nose, her cheeks \u2013 every inch of her face was covered in soft kisses and every kiss was followed by an \u2018I love you\u2019.</p><p>They don\u2019t notice the flashes as pictures are taken and fans whisper about why the couple looks so happy together. And when Jazz shows him an article that Zayn had linked her with a series of question marks and a confused congratulations \u2013 the headline read that they were engaged \u2013 Harry laughs along with Jazz. He ignores the emails and phone calls his agent sends him about putting out a statement (there\u2019s no point denying it when he\u2019s already started ring shopping) and continues to spend the rest of the week couped up inside his flat with his girlfriend, mentally planning their future together.</p><p><b>AN: AND DAS THE END MY PEEPS. Sorry it took so long (I really have no excuse sorry). Anyway, I may post some drabbles/blurbs etc if you guys want. So send me some requests and I\u2019ll try and write them if I feel inspireddddd.

The second thing he notices is that she\u2019s standing across from a guy with her cheeks pink and smile bright. He stands there for a few minutes, heart in his throat as he stares at the girl whose heart he\u2019d broken, only to break his own with her.<b><br></b></p><p>She looks happy he notes, watching as she throws her head back and laughs openly at something the man said. He grins at her reaction, a smug smile settling on his lips as he watches her. Harry feels his stomach churn at the interaction. He can\u2019t remember the last time Jazz had laughed like that around him.</p><p>He wonders if she\u2019ll ever laugh like that around him again because no matter what happened or how much time passed, Harry still wasn\u2019t able to accept that Jazz was gone for good.</p><p>Ever since Zayn had reminded him of her art show Harry had been restless. He\u2019d found a new found purpose, a lead on how to see - and hopefully win back - Jazz again. And he wasn\u2019t going to let some guy stand in his way.</p><p>He was hurt, there was no denying it. He hadn\u2019t thought Jazz would be able to move on from him so quickly - or maybe he\u2019d hoped she wouldn\u2019t be able to. He doesn\u2019t know if that makes him a bad person or not (he already knew he was a bad boyfriend), but he thinks it probably does.</p><p>And he\u2019s angry too, he finds. Underneath all the hurt and guilt, Harry feels a bubbling anger - at himself, at the guy who now had his hand resting gently on Jazz\u2019s arm, at <i>Jazz</i>. She\u2019d promised him she\u2019d never leave him, hadn\u2019t she? That she\u2019d never give up on them; <i>on him.</i> But there she was, laughing and smiling at a man that wasn\u2019t him while Harry felt himself drift further and further away.</p><p>He loves her <i>so much</i>. Can\u2019t imagine his world without her. He wonders when things changed between them, when he\u2019d taken her presence for granted and started ignoring the way she\u2019d always made his day better even when they fought and argued. Jazz had always had a rule - no matter how mad they were at each other, no matter what they were doing or where they were,<i> they always said I love you at least once a day.</i></p><p>With a jolt he realises he can\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d said those words to her, can\u2019t even remember the last time he\u2019s said anything remotely affectionate to her.</p><p>He pulls out his phone and opens up his messages immediately searching for Jazz\u2019s name. He finds her almost instantly, she was always at the top of his recent contacts, and feels what\u2019s left of his heart squeeze in on itself.</p><p>There were messages after messages that he\u2019d ignored from her, scattered \u2018I love you\u2019s and \u2018where are you\u2019s that he had paid no mind to. The questions and worried messages and missed calls had eventually tapered out, but the \u2018I love you\u2019s continued to come through all the way until the night he\u2019d last seen her.</p><p>Harry has tried to text and call her multiple times since then but either she\u2019s blocked his number (which he can\u2019t blame her for), or she\u2019s ignoring him the same way he\u2019d ignored her (which he can\u2019t blame her for <i>either</i>).</p><p>He rubs a tired hand over his face and chews on his lower lip. His fingers twitch and he clenches his hand into a fist beside his side. He wants to call her, wants to see if she really is screening all his calls. But he doesn\u2019t think he can stomach seeing her actively ignore him.</p><p>The man standing in front of her is making her smile again and Harry envisions - just for a second - what their life might be like together. He tries to stop the thought before it can fully form but it\u2019s too late and he\u2019s seeing white fences and a dog in the yard and children with Jazz\u2019s smile and blonde hair like her <i>companions</i>; and it all looks wrong.</p><p>The house is meant to be on hill in the countryside overlooking a huge garden with a shed at the back filled with art supplies and more than one puppy running around. The kids are meant to have curly brown hair and green eyes that glint in the sun as they run around screaming and giggling while their dad chases them. There are cats lounging on the porch while Jazz strokes them, a fond smile tugging on her lips as she watches her family plant flowers and herbs.</p><p>Harry shakes himself out of his thoughts and before he knows it, he\u2019s making his way over to the woman who holds his future in his hands. He wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d ever be able to move on from her, not when he\u2019s planned their whole future together. He\u2019d even gone looking for a damn ring last year, ready to ask her to marry him. And then he\u2019d gone and fucked it all up instead.</p><p>The man she\u2019d been standing with is gone Harry notes and he feels a sense of relief that he hadn\u2019t seen them part ways. He wasn\u2019t sure what he would have done if he\u2019d seen him kiss his girl goodbye.</p><p>\u201cJasmine,\u201d he chokes out once he\u2019s close enough, once he\u2019s walked through the door and the bell above his head chimes his arrival, once she turns around and sees him standing there her eyes wide and posture stiff.</p><p>Harry waits and waits for her to say something, anything, but all Jazz does is stand there and stare at him and Harry imagines she\u2019s drinking him in the way he is doing to her. Her cheeks are flushed pink and Harry can\u2019t help but wonder if the man from before put them there. His gut churns.</p><p>He swallows roughly and it feels as though there\u2019s a stone lodged deep in his oesophagus keeping him from speaking.</p><p>He wants to tell her he loves her, he wants to tell her he\u2019s sorry, he wants to beg her to come <i>home</i>.</p><p>But instead, he just stands there staring. A broken man with a broken heart and the only girl he thinks can ever make him whole again standing in front of him chewing her bottom lip raw.</p><p>Harry takes in the sight of her full pink lip disappearing between her teeth and finally finds he can\u2019t stay away from her any longer. He practically lunges towards her too quickly and too slowly all at the same time. He doesn\u2019t want to spook her but staying away from her for even another second is too much. <i>What if she disappears again?</i></p><p>\u201cJazz,\u201d he whispers when he\u2019s close enough, watching the way her lashes flutter shut and the breath stutters out of her, like she\u2019d been holding her breath and hadn\u2019t even realised it. Harry studies her closely, fingers twitching as he notes the darkness under her eyes. \u201cYou look tired,\u201d he says his eyes cataloguing every little change he sees in her.</p><p>\u201cHarry.\u201d</p><p>His name whispered on her lips is worse than a punch to the gut and he feels like he won\u2019t ever be able to breathe again unless he hears it again and again and again for the rest of his life.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d forgotten how sweet she sounded, how her laugh used to echo around their flat when everything was too quiet and tense and he needed something to calm him down.</p><p>He reaches out to her this time, his palm resting on her cheek as he strokes along under her eyes. \u201cI miss you.\u201d</p><p>She leans into him, her eyes fluttering shut as her breath puffs out across his wrist.</p><p>He stands still, unwilling to move away but worried that she\u2019ll push him off if he tries to bring her closer. Instead he takes in a deep breath, trying to breathe her <i>in, in, in.</i></p><p>She smells like watermelons and he wonders if she tastes the same, his eyes sinking to her lips and the way they shone in the glow of the studio lights. He knows she\u2019s prone to overusing her lip balm when she\u2019s stressed, swiping it across her lips almost every half an hour. He\u2019s seen her go through more than one tube a week and fallen into the habit of always having a few sitting spare at home.</p><p>\u201cDid Zayn tell you I was here?\u201d she asks him, and Harry is finally able to look away from her lips. He can\u2019t help but note that she\u2019s avoided responding to his confession and as hurt as he is, he knows that he can\u2019t blame her for it.</p><p>\u201cI had to force it out of him,\u201d he nods at her. They\u2019re still standing inches from each other and she still hasn\u2019t pushed him away and Harry is taking that as a good sign.</p><p>\u201cI doubt it would have taken much prodding.\u201d She winces as the words come out a little sharper than she\u2019d intended. \u201cHe\u2019s never been very good at keeping secrets,\u201d she adds.</p><p>\u201cEspecially when he thinks he\u2019s right,\u201d Harry joins in.</p><p>It\u2019s awkward.</p><p>Neither of them know what to say and neither of them seem to be willing to pull away.</p><p>Harry\u2019s still trying to take all of her in, trying to note any changes in the month they had spent apart. She\u2019s thinner and looks more tired and nervous and her eyes don\u2019t shine the way he\u2019s always used to, but she still looks like Jazz and he still thinks she\u2019s perfect.</p><p>Jazz can\u2019t help taking him in either. She looks at him and sees her past and future all entwined together and she doesn\u2019t know how to pull them apart.</p><p>She wants to be strong, wants to push him away and tell him that no, she doesn\u2019t care that he misses her, that he should have remembered that before he had treated her so mean.</p><p>But she can\u2019t.</p><p>She can\u2019t because despite what he\u2019s done, he\u2019s still standing in front of her with his eyes once again honest and kind and all kinds of hurt and she wonders if maybe he sees the same in hers.</p><p>Zayn\u2019s been telling her she needs to come home through texts she never answers, to forgive him at least a little bit because he\u2019s not been doing very well. She hadn\u2019t wanted to believe him at first, and she\u2019d hated herself for hoping it was true for the longest time afterwards as well. Now as she looks up at him as he tells her he misses her, she sees that it was true and she doesn\u2019t feel the satisfaction she thought she would have at the idea she wasn\u2019t the only one suffering. She just feels sad.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t know how they ended up here, two pieces of a broken puzzle that have no right fitting together anymore. But they do. They always will, she thinks.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here, Harry?\u201d she asks eventually, finally shifting away from him.</p><p>They both feel the loss instantly, a sudden chill running down both their spines.</p><p>Harry tucks his hands deep into his pockets, digging into the skin of his thighs to keep from reaching out for her again.</p><p>\u201cI want you to come home,\u201d he tells her without hesitation. He thinks it should be more said more eloquently as soon as the words are past his lips but it\u2019s too late and as blunt as they may be, he\u2019s spoken the truth. He just hopes that Jazz can see that.</p><p>He panics when he sees her look away from him. When she bites her lips and looks over his shoulder and out the door. He wonders if she\u2019s thinking about the man who was in here before him and he feels the panic rise to his throat like bile as he imagines her with someone else.</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d he forces out. \u201cI love you.\u201d And as he looks at her and sees the way her eyes widen a little and her shoulders drop at those words, he realises just how long it has been since he\u2019s said them to her. So he repeats them and silently vows to himself to say them every chance he gets for as long as she\u2019ll have him. Even if it is just for the next few minutes before she tells him she\u2019s met someone else. \u201cI love you.\u201d He says again, firmer. \u201cSo please, come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI \u2013 I dunno if I can,\u201d she confesses and she still won\u2019t look at him and Harry feels like he can\u2019t breathe. \u201cThere\u2019s this space between us and I don\u2019t know how to close it. I don\u2019t know if we can.\u201d She doesn\u2019t really mean it when she says that, doesn\u2019t want it to be true either. But she\u2019s started to doubt their relationship, she\u2019s started to doubt Harry and she thinks a part of her still wants to hurt him for that.</p><p>\u201cOf course you can,\u201d Harry says urgently, taking a step closer to her. She was too far away. Always too far. \u201cYou and me Jazz, we belong together, we always will. Together we can take over the whole damn world if we wanted to.\u201d</p><p>And she believes him. She believes him because he\u2019s Harry and she knows that a part of her \u2013 <i>most of her </i>\u2013 will always love him.</p><p>\u201cRemember?\u201d he steps closer to her, eyes flicking all over her face as he tries to read her. He hates that he\u2019s finding it so difficult now. He\u2019s never found it so difficult before. \u201cYou said you\u2019d never give up on us.\u201d And he knows he sounds accusatory, that she had every right to leave him. But he\u2019s still hurt and he\u2019s still in love with her and if he doesn\u2019t tell her everything now he knows he\u2019ll never forgive himself.</p><p>Jazz looks at him then, meets his gaze straight on and Harry\u2019s finally able to read her again but he wishes he wasn\u2019t, because when she looks at him now she looks nervous and afraid and unsure. Something she\u2019s not been with him since she\u2019d first introduced him to her family.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t look at me like that please. Don\u2019t look at me like it\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve met all over again.\u201d</p><p>Jazz doesn\u2019t say anything and he steels himself to having his heart broken. But when it doesn\u2019t come and she continues to look at him still, he promises himself that he\u2019ll do anything he can to make sure she never looks at him like that again.</p><p>Jazz sees the moment the resolve sets in his eyes like a curtain opening up to let the sun in and she thinks back to when they first met, when she\u2019d told her family about him. She thinks about how her parents had been worried that she wouldn\u2019t be able to handle being in a relationship with someone who was constantly in the spotlight and she remembers telling Harry as much.</p><p>He\u2019d taken her face between his hands and kissed every inch of worry away with his lips and then promised that he\u2019d change their mind. He\u2019d had the same look in his eyes then that he does now and she knows without a doubt that he would\u2019ve spent the rest of his life trying to make sure he kept his promise.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t needed to.</p><p>Her parents had loved him almost as much as she did, and even when she\u2019d gone to them after the fight she\u2019d had with Harry a month ago, they\u2019d still urged her to go back and talk it through with him. <i>\u2018That boy would burn himself to the ground trying to bring you the sun if you asked him to\u2019</i> her mum had told her.</p><p>\u201cJazz?\u201d he calls out to her, and when she blinks she realises he\u2019s looking at her worriedly. \u201cAre you ok? Your eyes glazed over a little there. Have you been drinking enough water? Are you feeling ok?\u201d His hands flutter by his sides before he gives in and reaches out to feel her head for a temperature.</p><p>He looks so worried about her that she can\u2019t help it. She leans up and kisses him.</p><p>Harry\u2019s entire body goes slack at the contact and wonders how he\u2019s managed to be apart from her for so long without falling completely to pieces. When she pulls away from him, it\u2019s too soon and he feels himself starting to unravel again but he just barely holds himself together. There were more important things to worry about right now.</p><p>\u201cDoes this mean you\u2019ll come home?\u201d he asks her, breathes on her, really. He hasn\u2019t moved away and neither has she and their lips have barely separated from one another. He can feel whispers of her kiss with every word he utters as his lips skim along hers and their breath mingles together. With her so close, he feels as though he\u2019s got a part of himself back.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she nods and Harry swears she moves even closer and his heart swells. \u201cI\u2019ve been miserable without you,\u201d she confesses, whispers it across his lips like a secret only meant for him and he kisses her again. Harder, deeper and infinitely more desperate. There\u2019s over a month of kisses he has to make up for.</p><p>A flash of blonde hair and Jazz laughing crosses his mind and he thinks of the man who was in here earlier, his hands on her arms and a fond smile on his lips and he wonders if maybe someone else had already been kissing her while he was waiting for her to come home.</p><p>He pulls away from her and instantly regrets it when Jazz tries to chase his lips. But his stomach has dropped and his mood has plummeted and he wonders if maybe they had been broken up this past month and not just giving each other space.</p><p>\u201cI \u2013 that man,\u201d he scratches at the back of his neck roughly. He doesn\u2019t know what to say. How to say it. So he just speaks without thinking about the words flowing past his lips. \u201cThere was a man in here earlier,\u201d he starts. \u201cWho was he?\u201d he thinks he sounds a little angry but he can\u2019t help it. He\u2019s nervous and jealous and the idea of another man putting his hands on his Jasmine makes Harry see red.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t normally a jealous person. But Jazz was <i>his</i>.</p><p>\u201cMan?\u201d Jazz tilts her head, tries to move closer to him once more and looks hurt when he steps back again. \u201cWhat man?\u201d</p><p>Harry feels angry suddenly. He\u2019d <i>seen</i> them standing together, much like he and Jazz were right now. Was she trying to lie to him? Did she think he\u2019d leave her if he found out she\u2019d moved on so quickly? Fat chance. Harry narrowed his eyes at the thought. He\u2019d fight tooth and nail for her. take on the whole damn world and turn it to ashes to win her back.</p><p>\u201cThere was a man in here earlier, Jazz. I saw him standing exactly the way we are right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d she grins when she realises who he\u2019s talking about. Body slumping with relief. \u201cYou mean Matt.\u201d</p><p>Harry already hates him. Hates the way she smiles when she says his name. Hates that she ever said it in the first place. \u201cI guess so. The one who was touching you too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouching me?\u201d she blinks at him and the confusion is back.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Harry nods vigorously. \u201cHe had his hand on your arm and you were laughing at something he\u2019d said.

The very idea of Jazz with someone else has him seeing red and all he wants to do is grab hold of her and lock her away in a tower like Rapunzel with only each other for company.

The second thing he notices is that she&rsquo;s standing across from a guy with her cheeks pink and smile bright. He stands there for a few minutes, heart in his throat as he stares at the girl whose heart he&rsquo;d broken, only to break his own with her.<b><br /></b></p><p>She looks happy he notes, watching as she throws her head back and laughs openly at something the man said. He grins at her reaction, a smug smile settling on his lips as he watches her. Harry feels his stomach churn at the interaction. He can&rsquo;t remember the last time Jazz had laughed like that around him.</p><p>He wonders if she&rsquo;ll ever laugh like that around him again because no matter what happened or how much time passed, Harry still wasn&rsquo;t able to accept that Jazz was gone for good.</p><p>Ever since Zayn had reminded him of her art show Harry had been restless. He&rsquo;d found a new found purpose, a lead on how to see - and hopefully win back - Jazz again. And he wasn&rsquo;t going to let some guy stand in his way.</p><p>He was hurt, there was no denying it. He hadn&rsquo;t thought Jazz would be able to move on from him so quickly - or maybe he&rsquo;d hoped she wouldn&rsquo;t be able to. He doesn&rsquo;t know if that makes him a bad person or not (he already knew he was a bad boyfriend), but he thinks it probably does.</p><p>And he&rsquo;s angry too, he finds. Underneath all the hurt and guilt, Harry feels a bubbling anger - at himself, at the guy who now had his hand resting gently on Jazz&rsquo;s arm, at <i>Jazz</i>. She&rsquo;d promised him she&rsquo;d never leave him, hadn&rsquo;t she? That she&rsquo;d never give up on them; <i>on him.</i> But there she was, laughing and smiling at a man that wasn&rsquo;t him while Harry felt himself drift further and further away.</p><p>He loves her <i>so much</i>. Can&rsquo;t imagine his world without her. He wonders when things changed between them, when he&rsquo;d taken her presence for granted and started ignoring the way she&rsquo;d always made his day better even when they fought and argued. Jazz had always had a rule - no matter how mad they were at each other, no matter what they were doing or where they were,<i> they always said I love you at least once a day.</i></p><p>With a jolt he realises he can&rsquo;t remember the last time he&rsquo;d said those words to her, can&rsquo;t even remember the last time he&rsquo;s said anything remotely affectionate to her.</p><p>He pulls out his phone and opens up his messages immediately searching for Jazz&rsquo;s name. He finds her almost instantly, she was always at the top of his recent contacts, and feels what&rsquo;s left of his heart squeeze in on itself.</p><p>There were messages after messages that he&rsquo;d ignored from her, scattered &lsquo;I love you&rsquo;s and &lsquo;where are you&rsquo;s that he had paid no mind to. The questions and worried messages and missed calls had eventually tapered out, but the &lsquo;I love you&rsquo;s continued to come through all the way until the night he&rsquo;d last seen her.</p><p>Harry has tried to text and call her multiple times since then but either she&rsquo;s blocked his number (which he can&rsquo;t blame her for), or she&rsquo;s ignoring him the same way he&rsquo;d ignored her (which he can&rsquo;t blame her for <i>either</i>).</p><p>He rubs a tired hand over his face and chews on his lower lip. His fingers twitch and he clenches his hand into a fist beside his side. He wants to call her, wants to see if she really is screening all his calls. But he doesn&rsquo;t think he can stomach seeing her actively ignore him.</p><p>The man standing in front of her is making her smile again and Harry envisions - just for a second - what their life might be like together. He tries to stop the thought before it can fully form but it&rsquo;s too late and he&rsquo;s seeing white fences and a dog in the yard and children with Jazz&rsquo;s smile and blonde hair like her <i>companions</i>; and it all looks wrong.</p><p>The house is meant to be on hill in the countryside overlooking a huge garden with a shed at the back filled with art supplies and more than one puppy running around. The kids are meant to have curly brown hair and green eyes that glint in the sun as they run around screaming and giggling while their dad chases them. There are cats lounging on the porch while Jazz strokes them, a fond smile tugging on her lips as she watches her family plant flowers and herbs.</p><p>Harry shakes himself out of his thoughts and before he knows it, he&rsquo;s making his way over to the woman who holds his future in his hands. He wasn&rsquo;t sure he&rsquo;d ever be able to move on from her, not when he&rsquo;s planned their whole future together. He&rsquo;d even gone looking for a damn ring last year, ready to ask her to marry him. And then he&rsquo;d gone and fucked it all up instead.</p><p>The man she&rsquo;d been standing with is gone Harry notes and he feels a sense of relief that he hadn&rsquo;t seen them part ways. He wasn&rsquo;t sure what he would have done if he&rsquo;d seen him kiss his girl goodbye.</p><p>&ldquo;Jasmine,&rdquo; he chokes out once he&rsquo;s close enough, once he&rsquo;s walked through the door and the bell above his head chimes his arrival, once she turns around and sees him standing there her eyes wide and posture stiff.</p><p>Harry waits and waits for her to say something, anything, but all Jazz does is stand there and stare at him and Harry imagines she&rsquo;s drinking him in the way he is doing to her. Her cheeks are flushed pink and Harry can&rsquo;t help but wonder if the man from before put them there. His gut churns.</p><p>He swallows roughly and it feels as though there&rsquo;s a stone lodged deep in his oesophagus keeping him from speaking.</p><p>He wants to tell her he loves her, he wants to tell her he&rsquo;s sorry, he wants to beg her to come <i>home</i>.</p><p>But instead, he just stands there staring. A broken man with a broken heart and the only girl he thinks can ever make him whole again standing in front of him chewing her bottom lip raw.</p><p>Harry takes in the sight of her full pink lip disappearing between her teeth and finally finds he can&rsquo;t stay away from her any longer. He practically lunges towards her too quickly and too slowly all at the same time. He doesn&rsquo;t want to spook her but staying away from her for even another second is too much. <i>What if she disappears again?</i></p><p>&ldquo;Jazz,&rdquo; he whispers when he&rsquo;s close enough, watching the way her lashes flutter shut and the breath stutters out of her, like she&rsquo;d been holding her breath and hadn&rsquo;t even realised it. Harry studies her closely, fingers twitching as he notes the darkness under her eyes. &ldquo;You look tired,&rdquo; he says his eyes cataloguing every little change he sees in her.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry.&rdquo;</p><p>His name whispered on her lips is worse than a punch to the gut and he feels like he won&rsquo;t ever be able to breathe again unless he hears it again and again and again for the rest of his life.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p><p>He&rsquo;d forgotten how sweet she sounded, how her laugh used to echo around their flat when everything was too quiet and tense and he needed something to calm him down.</p><p>He reaches out to her this time, his palm resting on her cheek as he strokes along under her eyes. &ldquo;I miss you.&rdquo;</p><p>She leans into him, her eyes fluttering shut as her breath puffs out across his wrist.</p><p>He stands still, unwilling to move away but worried that she&rsquo;ll push him off if he tries to bring her closer. Instead he takes in a deep breath, trying to breathe her <i>in, in, in.</i></p><p>She smells like watermelons and he wonders if she tastes the same, his eyes sinking to her lips and the way they shone in the glow of the studio lights. He knows she&rsquo;s prone to overusing her lip balm when she&rsquo;s stressed, swiping it across her lips almost every half an hour. He&rsquo;s seen her go through more than one tube a week and fallen into the habit of always having a few sitting spare at home.</p><p>&ldquo;Did Zayn tell you I was here?&rdquo; she asks him, and Harry is finally able to look away from her lips. He can&rsquo;t help but note that she&rsquo;s avoided responding to his confession and as hurt as he is, he knows that he can&rsquo;t blame her for it.</p><p>&ldquo;I had to force it out of him,&rdquo; he nods at her. They&rsquo;re still standing inches from each other and she still hasn&rsquo;t pushed him away and Harry is taking that as a good sign.</p><p>&ldquo;I doubt it would have taken much prodding.&rdquo; She winces as the words come out a little sharper than she&rsquo;d intended. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s never been very good at keeping secrets,&rdquo; she adds.</p><p>&ldquo;Especially when he thinks he&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Harry joins in.</p><p>It&rsquo;s awkward.</p><p>Neither of them know what to say and neither of them seem to be willing to pull away.</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s still trying to take all of her in, trying to note any changes in the month they had spent apart. She&rsquo;s thinner and looks more tired and nervous and her eyes don&rsquo;t shine the way he&rsquo;s always used to, but she still looks like Jazz and he still thinks she&rsquo;s perfect.</p><p>Jazz can&rsquo;t help taking him in either. She looks at him and sees her past and future all entwined together and she doesn&rsquo;t know how to pull them apart.</p><p>She wants to be strong, wants to push him away and tell him that no, she doesn&rsquo;t care that he misses her, that he should have remembered that before he had treated her so mean.</p><p>But she can&rsquo;t.</p><p>She can&rsquo;t because despite what he&rsquo;s done, he&rsquo;s still standing in front of her with his eyes once again honest and kind and all kinds of hurt and she wonders if maybe he sees the same in hers.</p><p>Zayn&rsquo;s been telling her she needs to come home through texts she never answers, to forgive him at least a little bit because he&rsquo;s not been doing very well. She hadn&rsquo;t wanted to believe him at first, and she&rsquo;d hated herself for hoping it was true for the longest time afterwards as well. Now as she looks up at him as he tells her he misses her, she sees that it was true and she doesn&rsquo;t feel the satisfaction she thought she would have at the idea she wasn&rsquo;t the only one suffering. She just feels sad.</p><p>She doesn&rsquo;t know how they ended up here, two pieces of a broken puzzle that have no right fitting together anymore. But they do. They always will, she thinks.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you here, Harry?&rdquo; she asks eventually, finally shifting away from him.</p><p>They both feel the loss instantly, a sudden chill running down both their spines.</p><p>Harry tucks his hands deep into his pockets, digging into the skin of his thighs to keep from reaching out for her again.</p><p>&ldquo;I want you to come home,&rdquo; he tells her without hesitation. He thinks it should be more said more eloquently as soon as the words are past his lips but it&rsquo;s too late and as blunt as they may be, he&rsquo;s spoken the truth. He just hopes that Jazz can see that.</p><p>He panics when he sees her look away from him. When she bites her lips and looks over his shoulder and out the door. He wonders if she&rsquo;s thinking about the man who was in here before him and he feels the panic rise to his throat like bile as he imagines her with someone else.</p><p>&ldquo;Please?&rdquo; he forces out. &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; And as he looks at her and sees the way her eyes widen a little and her shoulders drop at those words, he realises just how long it has been since he&rsquo;s said them to her. So he repeats them and silently vows to himself to say them every chance he gets for as long as she&rsquo;ll have him. Even if it is just for the next few minutes before she tells him she&rsquo;s met someone else. &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; He says again, firmer. &ldquo;So please, come home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I &ndash; I dunno if I can,&rdquo; she confesses and she still won&rsquo;t look at him and Harry feels like he can&rsquo;t breathe. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s this space between us and I don&rsquo;t know how to close it. I don&rsquo;t know if we can.&rdquo; She doesn&rsquo;t really mean it when she says that, doesn&rsquo;t want it to be true either. But she&rsquo;s started to doubt their relationship, she&rsquo;s started to doubt Harry and she thinks a part of her still wants to hurt him for that.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course you can,&rdquo; Harry says urgently, taking a step closer to her. She was too far away. Always too far. &ldquo;You and me Jazz, we belong together, we always will. Together we can take over the whole damn world if we wanted to.&rdquo;</p><p>And she believes him. She believes him because he&rsquo;s Harry and she knows that a part of her &ndash; <i>most of her </i>&ndash; will always love him.</p><p>&ldquo;Remember?&rdquo; he steps closer to her, eyes flicking all over her face as he tries to read her. He hates that he&rsquo;s finding it so difficult now. He&rsquo;s never found it so difficult before. &ldquo;You said you&rsquo;d never give up on us.&rdquo; And he knows he sounds accusatory, that she had every right to leave him. But he&rsquo;s still hurt and he&rsquo;s still in love with her and if he doesn&rsquo;t tell her everything now he knows he&rsquo;ll never forgive himself.</p><p>Jazz looks at him then, meets his gaze straight on and Harry&rsquo;s finally able to read her again but he wishes he wasn&rsquo;t, because when she looks at him now she looks nervous and afraid and unsure. Something she&rsquo;s not been with him since she&rsquo;d first introduced him to her family.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t look at me like that please. Don&rsquo;t look at me like it&rsquo;s the first time we&rsquo;ve met all over again.&rdquo;</p><p>Jazz doesn&rsquo;t say anything and he steels himself to having his heart broken. But when it doesn&rsquo;t come and she continues to look at him still, he promises himself that he&rsquo;ll do anything he can to make sure she never looks at him like that again.</p><p>Jazz sees the moment the resolve sets in his eyes like a curtain opening up to let the sun in and she thinks back to when they first met, when she&rsquo;d told her family about him. She thinks about how her parents had been worried that she wouldn&rsquo;t be able to handle being in a relationship with someone who was constantly in the spotlight and she remembers telling Harry as much.</p><p>He&rsquo;d taken her face between his hands and kissed every inch of worry away with his lips and then promised that he&rsquo;d change their mind. He&rsquo;d had the same look in his eyes then that he does now and she knows without a doubt that he would&rsquo;ve spent the rest of his life trying to make sure he kept his promise.</p><p>But he hadn&rsquo;t needed to.</p><p>Her parents had loved him almost as much as she did, and even when she&rsquo;d gone to them after the fight she&rsquo;d had with Harry a month ago, they&rsquo;d still urged her to go back and talk it through with him. <i>&lsquo;That boy would burn himself to the ground trying to bring you the sun if you asked him to&rsquo;</i> her mum had told her.</p><p>&ldquo;Jazz?&rdquo; he calls out to her, and when she blinks she realises he&rsquo;s looking at her worriedly. &ldquo;Are you ok? Your eyes glazed over a little there. Have you been drinking enough water? Are you feeling ok?&rdquo; His hands flutter by his sides before he gives in and reaches out to feel her head for a temperature.</p><p>He looks so worried about her that she can&rsquo;t help it. She leans up and kisses him.</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s entire body goes slack at the contact and wonders how he&rsquo;s managed to be apart from her for so long without falling completely to pieces. When she pulls away from him, it&rsquo;s too soon and he feels himself starting to unravel again but he just barely holds himself together. There were more important things to worry about right now.</p><p>&ldquo;Does this mean you&rsquo;ll come home?&rdquo; he asks her, breathes on her, really. He hasn&rsquo;t moved away and neither has she and their lips have barely separated from one another. He can feel whispers of her kiss with every word he utters as his lips skim along hers and their breath mingles together. With her so close, he feels as though he&rsquo;s got a part of himself back.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she nods and Harry swears she moves even closer and his heart swells. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been miserable without you,&rdquo; she confesses, whispers it across his lips like a secret only meant for him and he kisses her again. Harder, deeper and infinitely more desperate. There&rsquo;s over a month of kisses he has to make up for.</p><p>A flash of blonde hair and Jazz laughing crosses his mind and he thinks of the man who was in here earlier, his hands on her arms and a fond smile on his lips and he wonders if maybe someone else had already been kissing her while he was waiting for her to come home.</p><p>He pulls away from her and instantly regrets it when Jazz tries to chase his lips. But his stomach has dropped and his mood has plummeted and he wonders if maybe they had been broken up this past month and not just giving each other space.</p><p>&ldquo;I &ndash; that man,&rdquo; he scratches at the back of his neck roughly. He doesn&rsquo;t know what to say. How to say it. So he just speaks without thinking about the words flowing past his lips. &ldquo;There was a man in here earlier,&rdquo; he starts. &ldquo;Who was he?&rdquo; he thinks he sounds a little angry but he can&rsquo;t help it. He&rsquo;s nervous and jealous and the idea of another man putting his hands on his Jasmine makes Harry see red.</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t normally a jealous person. But Jazz was <i>his</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;Man?&rdquo; Jazz tilts her head, tries to move closer to him once more and looks hurt when he steps back again. &ldquo;What man?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry feels angry suddenly. He&rsquo;d <i>seen</i> them standing together, much like he and Jazz were right now. Was she trying to lie to him? Did she think he&rsquo;d leave her if he found out she&rsquo;d moved on so quickly? Fat chance. Harry narrowed his eyes at the thought. He&rsquo;d fight tooth and nail for her. take on the whole damn world and turn it to ashes to win her back.</p><p>&ldquo;There was a man in here earlier, Jazz. I saw him standing exactly the way we are right now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she grins when she realises who he&rsquo;s talking about. Body slumping with relief. &ldquo;You mean Matt.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry already hates him. Hates the way she smiles when she says his name. Hates that she ever said it in the first place. &ldquo;I guess so. The one who was touching you too much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Touching me?&rdquo; she blinks at him and the confusion is back.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Harry nods vigorously. &ldquo;He had his hand on your arm and you were laughing at something he&rsquo;d said. If he&rsquo;s a client it wasn&rsquo;t very professional,&rdquo; he adds, he sounds pouty and superior all at once and Jazz wants to hug him and kiss him and hit him all at once.</p><p>But then she realises what he&rsquo;s saying and suddenly Jazz is laughing at him and Harry&rsquo;s torn between watching her with awe and pulling his hair out because this was <i>serious</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, are you jealous?&rdquo; she asks him, once her laughter had turned to giggles and she once again took a step closer to him. This time he stays where he is.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Yes.</p><p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; she quirks a brow. &ldquo;So if I were to tell you I have plans this weekend to grab dinner with Matt, you&rsquo;d be ok with that?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry couldn&rsquo;t stop the growl that escaped his lips if he tried and he doesn&rsquo;t think he wants to. The very idea of Jazz with someone else has him seeing red and all he wants to do is grab hold of her and lock her away in a tower like Rapunzel with only each other for company. He really likes the idea of that.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine, I&rsquo;m a little jealous,&rdquo; he admits, reaching out and entwining their hands together. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the idea of you with someone else. But&hellip; I &ndash; I don&rsquo;t blame you if you&rsquo;ve found someone who treated you the way you deserved.&rdquo; He forces the words past his lips and even tries to mean them but his heart still clenches at the thought and he thinks that it may very well stop if she agrees.</p><p>&ldquo;Matt&rsquo;s my cousin, you silly goose,&rdquo; she bumps his shoulder fondly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in the city for the weekend and wanted to grab dinner before he left.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Harry grins down at her sheepishly. &ldquo;Can I come?&rdquo;</p><p>Jazz lets out a loud, happy laugh and pulls him towards the door. &ldquo;Come on, Harry, let&rsquo;s go home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I might never let you leave,&rdquo; he warns her only half jokingly.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hold you to that,&rdquo; she warns him, her heart full once again.

Looking at\nhis face, you frowned. \u201cHarry? What&rsquo;s wrong? Are you feeling okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m\nfine, just a wee bit of a cold.\u201d He pulled you into a warm hug.</p><p>\u201cAre\nyou sure?\u201d You asked, not convinced. Putting your hand to his cheek\nand then his forehead, you could feel the warmth radiating from him.</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m\nsure!\u201d He said brushing you off. \u201cI&rsquo;m not going to let a little\ncold ruin your family Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut..\u201d\nYou started to abject.</p><p>Putting\nhis finger over your mouth, he shook his head. \u201cNo buts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine!\nBut you have to go sit down and relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\nma'am\u201d He said sassy.</p><p>Rolling\nyour eyes, you pushed him towards the living room. You picked up the\npresents he had left by the door and placed then under the tree.\nHarry made his way to the couch in the corner, and you brought him a\nblanket.</p><p>\u201cSo..\nWhen is everyone suppose to be here?\u201d He questioned, yawning.</p><p>\u201cShould\nbe any minute now. Can I get you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m\nalright.\u201d He mumbled closing his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre\nyou sure? I could make you some soup, or I could get you some tea. I\nthink I have some cold medicine here somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Harry\nlet out a slight chuckle. \u201cI&rsquo;m fine mum!\u201d</p><p>You\nplayfully smacked him. \u201cI&rsquo;m just trying to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nknow, I know. Thanks, love.\u201d He muttered settling deeper into the\nsofa. \n</p><p>You\nwatched him fondly for a moment. It hurt you to see him sick, and all\nyou wanted to do was make him feel better. You decided to let him\nrest. Going to the kitchen, you tried to busy yourself until your\nfamily arrived.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>You\nhad just finished removing cookies from the oven, when you heard the\ndoorbell ring. Rushing to answer it, you greeted your family.</p><p>\u201cY/n!\u201d\nYour dad called out first, giving you a big hug.</p><p>\u201cHey\ny/n,\u201d your step-mom came next. \u201cIt&rsquo;s smells wonderful in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank\nyou!\u201d You told her giving her a brief hug.</p><p>Your\nbrother and his wife were the next in line. Then came your sister and\nher new boyfriend. After greeting everyone, you led them to the\nliving room. Harry was sound asleep in the corner.</p><p>\u201cOh\nhey! Harry&rsquo;s here!\u201d Trina cheered. Your sister was a huge fan of\nHarry&rsquo;s and always stayed close by whenever he was around.</p><p>\u201cYes,\nbut he&rsquo;s not feeling well. So behave!\u201d You told her sternly. She\nstuck her tongue out at you, causing you to laugh. \u201cReal mature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre\nyou ever gonna tell that boy you&rsquo;re in love with him?\u201d She asked\ncurious.</p><p>\u201cTrina!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d\nShe said unashamed.</p><p>\u201cHarry\nand I are just friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\nyeah. Whatever you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright!\nEnough bickering you two.\u201d Your dad called out.</p><p>\u201cWhy\ndon&rsquo;t we start eating?\u201d You suggested.</p><p>Getting\nan agreement from everyone in the room, you motioned for them to head\ntowards the dining room.</p><p>\u201cWhat\nabout Harry?\u201d Trina asked disappointed.</p><p>\u201cHarry\nneeds to sleep. I&rsquo;ll fix him a plate later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwe\nlook at you all caring. Your so in love,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cOh\nhush!\u201d</p><p>Your\nfamily gathered around the table and passed around the food. The\nconversation flowed nicely. Your family had always been one to make\nfun of one another. The laughter was nonstop, as the jokes flew back\nand forth.</p><p>You\nenjoyed having your family over. You had always been a big family\nperson and found peace in the company you shared.</p><p>Once\ndinner was finished, and the dishes put away, you all headed back\ninto the living room. It was getting late, and it was time to open\npresents.</p><p>Heading\nto where Harry still laid, you quietly put your hand on his forehead.\nHis skin felt even hotter than it had before. Rushing back to the\nkitchen you got a glass of water and some medicine. Upon returning,\nyou nudged Harry.</p><p>\u201cHarry.\u201d\nYou shook him.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d\nHe responded turning his head towards you, with his eyes still\nclosed.</p><p>\u201cCome\non! Take this,\u201d you urged him.</p><p>Mumbling\nsome more he sat up on the couch and took the cup of water from you.</p><p>\u201cWhat\nis it?\u201d He asked looking at the pills questionably.</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s\nmedicine! It&rsquo;ll make you feel better.\u201d He gave you a doubtful look.\n\u201cOh just take it, you big baby!\u201d</p><p>Grunting\nhe grabbed the pills from you and threw them into his mouth. \u201cYou\naren&rsquo;t trying to poison me are you?\u201d He asked after swallowing his\nmedicine.</p><p>\u201cI\nguess we&rsquo;ll find out,\u201d you teased. \u201cDo you feel well enough to\nopen presents with us?\u201d</p><p>He\nlooked around, at the mention of &lsquo;us&rsquo;. Seeing your family, he looked\na bit embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cY/n!\nWhy didn&rsquo;t you wake me when everyone got here?\u201d He whispered to\nyou.</p><p>\u201cYou\nneeded your rest.\u201d You stated simply.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Shaking\nhis head, he said a brief hello to each member of your family. Trina\nwas ecstatic that he was finally up. She came to sit in between the\ntwo of you and started to bombard him with questions. Rolling your\neyes, you gave Harry a look of pity. Deciding to save him, you tried\nto get her attention. \n</p><p>\u201cTrina,\nhow about we let Harry have a breather and open presents?\u201d At the\nmention of this, Trina leaped up with joy. You stared after your 17\nyear old sister in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cThank\nyou!\u201d Harry spoke softly so only you could hear.</p><p>\u201cAnytime,\u201d\nyou told him with a smile.</p><p>You\nremained by his side, as your dad started handing out presents. Harry\nleaned over and laid his head in your lap. You smiled down at him\nfondly, since he was looking away.</p><p>\u201cHow\nare you feeling?\u201d You asked running your fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cAwful,\u201d\nhe admitted finally.</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m\nsorry dear.\u201d You told him worried.</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s\nalright, you make it all better. Will you stay with me?\u201d He closed\nhis eyes and relaxed a bit into your lap.</p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse. I&rsquo;m not going anywhere.\u201d His skin felt as if it were on\nfire, and you desperately hoped the fever would soon break.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Harry\ndosed in and out of consciousness, as you watched your family unwrap\ntheir gifts. This had always been your favorite time of the year. You\nloved having your family around. Along with Harry, they were your\nfavorite people in the world. You just wished he felt better so he\ncould enjoy it with you as well.</p><p>You\nkept noticing your mom glancing at the two of you. She had a smirk on\nher face, and you knew what she had been thinking instantly.\nSecretly, your entire family had been routing for the two of you to\nget together. You had to admit, you wanted the same.</p><p>You\nand Harry had been best friends for as long as you could remember.\nYou couldn&rsquo;t remember a time where he wasn&rsquo;t a part of your life. He\nmeant the world to you, and you wanted more than anything to be the\none who made him the happiest.</p><p>You\nwatched for years as he dated girls that did nothing but use him.\nThey all seemed to be the same. They would date him long enough to be\nin the spotlight, and then leave him broken. It killed you that he\nfell for their lies and manipulation.</p><p>'If\nonly he could see how much you truly loved him for him.&rsquo; You thought\nsadly.</p><p>It had\ngotten late, and your family were getting ready to leave. You started\nto get up, to tell them goodbye.</p><p>\u201cNoo\ndon&rsquo;t go,\u201d Harry whined half asleep. He grabbed your waist to keep\nyou there.</p><p>Laughing\nslightly, you looked at him sadly. He would never know how much it\nhurt you when he done things like this. He always grew quite clingy\nwhen he was drunk or unwell. You loved clingy Harry, but deep down\nknew that it would never mean the same to him as it did to you.</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;ll\nbe right back, I promise.\u201d You told him. He pouted further, but let\nyou go.</p><p>You\nquickly told your family to drive carefully and lead them out the\nfront. Your mom hung back briefly, as you watched the others head for\nthe car.</p><p>She\nsmiled at you, as she looked you over. \u201cOh just say it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney,\u201d\nshe started. \u201cI just hate seeing you like this. I don&rsquo;t want you to\nget hurt. I know you care for him, but you just have to take care of\nyourself as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nknow,\u201d you whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou\nknow I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nknow, I love you too mom.\u201d Giving her one final hug, you watched\nher leave.</p><p>Sighing,\nyou shut the door and returned to Harry. He was sound asleep once\nmore. Checking his head, you sighed with relief. His temperature was\nfinally starting to drop.</p><p>Checking\nthe time, you left him to get some more medicine. You also made him a\nbowl of soup. You knew that your mom had been right, but you couldn&rsquo;t\nhelp how you felt. You couldn&rsquo;t imagine your life without Harry. If\nthat meant you had to just be his friend, so be it.</p><p>Trying\nto clear your mind, you headed back to wake him. Setting his food on\nthe end table, you went to wake him.</p><p>\u201cHarryy,\u201d\nyou sung softly. \u201cTime to wake up!\u201d</p><p>He\ngroaned, but didn&rsquo;t budge. \u201cCome on sleepy head! You need to take\nsome more medicine and eat something.\u201d</p><p>Groaning\nonce more, he slowly sat up. He looked adorable, with his hair a mess\nand sleep in his eyes. Giving him the pills, he swallowed them\nwithout protest. \n</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d\nyou handed him the soup. \u201cYou need to eat something.\u201d His\nhesitation caused you to roll your eyes. \u201cOh come on! I made your\nfavorite, and you know I&rsquo;m not gonna stop until you finish it.\u201d</p><p>Sighing,\nhe took the bowl. He knew it would be pointless to fight a losing\nbattle. \u201cYou&rsquo;re going to be the death of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;re\nwelcome!\u201d You told him smiling. \u201cI honestly don&rsquo;t know what you\nwould do without me!\u201d</p><p>He\ngave you a shy smile. \u201cI don&rsquo;t either,\u201d he muttered. He has\nspoken so quietly that you weren&rsquo;t sure you had heard him correctly.</p><p>Finishing\nhis soup in silence, you decided to turn on a Christmas movie. He sat\naside his empty bowl and smirked at you. \u201cHappy now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost,\u201d\nyou told him smiling. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA\nbit better.\u201d He laid down, once more putting his head in your lap.\n\u201cThank you for taking care of me.\u201d He mumbled snuggling into you.</p><p>\u201cWhat\nare friends for,\u201d you told him sadly.</p><p>Sensing\nyour mood shift, he glanced up at you. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d He asked\nconcerned.</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s\nnothing,\u201d you told him faking a smile.</p><p>\u201cEven\nwhen I&rsquo;m sick, I can still tell when your lying to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m\nnot lying.\u201d You told him sticking out your tongue.</p><p>\u201cI\nknow you didn&rsquo;t just stick your tongue out at me,\u201d he said with a\nwicked glint in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo\nwhat if I did?\u201d You said challenging him.</p><p>Slowly\nhe sat up, as he watched you. Without warning, he started to tickle\nyour sides.</p><p>\u201cHeyy!\u201d\nYou said protesting trying to fight him off.</p><p>\u201cSay\nyou&rsquo;re sorry,\u201d he said laughing.</p><p>\u201cNever!\u201d\nYou said between giggles.</p><p>He\ncontinued in his torment. \u201cI can do this all night,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d\nYou said giving in. \u201cI give up, but only because you\u2019re sick! I&rsquo;m sorry!\u201d</p><p>He\nlooked at you fondly. \u201cAnd?\u201d He prompted</p><p>\u201cAnd..\nHarry Styles is the most wonderful and sexy man of all time.\u201d\nYou told him automatically.</p><p>\u201cAnd\ndon&rsquo;t you forget it,\u201d he said with a smirk.</p><p>He was\njust inches from your face, causing your breath to catch in your\nthroat. \u201cYou&rsquo;re so beautiful,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Rolling\nyour eyes, you looked away. This had not been the first time he had\nsaid those words, and your heart wanted so bad to believe him.</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m\nserious!\u201d He said turning your head back so he could look at you.\nHis face grew serious.</p><p>\u201cWell thank you, H.\u201d You leaned over and kissed his forehead gently.</p><p>His eyes slipped closed, and he gave you a shy smile. \u201cYou know I&rsquo;ve always been curious about\nsomething.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat&rsquo;s\nthat?\u201d You whispered. Your heart was pounding out of your chest,\nand you were sure that he could hear it.</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;ve\nalways wondered what it would be like to kiss you.\u201d He confessed.</p><p>This\ntook you off guard. He looked sincere, but you knew it was too good\nto be true. \u201cThat must be the fever talking.\u201d You said laughing\nnervously.</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m\nserious!\u201d He said hurt. \u201cI&rsquo;ve always had a thing for you, and I\nwould never be able to forgive myself if I never told you how I\nfelt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry..\nPlease don&rsquo;t.\u201d You begged turning from him. Turning away, you felt\ntears prick your eyes.</p><p>\u201cY/n,\u201d\nhe whispered, trying to get your attention once more. Giving up, he\ndropped his hand. \u201cI understand if you don&rsquo;t feel the same.\u201d</p><p>The\nsilence lingered only briefly. Taking a deep breathe, you turned back\nto him. He looked hurt, as he took in the tears running down your\nface.</p><p>\u201cHey..\nplease don&rsquo;t cry.\u201d He begged wiping the tears from your cheek.</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d\nyou said finally, grabbing his hand. You held it to your face, as you\nclosed your eyes. \u201cHarry..\u201d You began again. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nknow,\u201d he whispered, \u201cand I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\nyou don&rsquo;t get it,\u201d you told him shaking your head. You looked into\nhis eyes with new determination. \u201cHarry.. I&rsquo;m in love with you. I\nhave been since we first became friends all those years ago. I just\nnever knew how to tell you. I didn&rsquo;t want to risk losing you.\u201d You\nconfessed quietly.</p><p>You\nlooked away, as you let him digest your words. The silence lingered.\nYour heart started to break, as you imagined the worst.</p><p>\u201cYou\ndon&rsquo;t have to say anything,\u201d you whispered. \u201cWe can just forget\nthis entire night, if you want.\u201d</p><p>The\nsilence was maddening. You finally made yourself look at him.\nGlancing towards him, you froze. He had the most breathtaking smile\ngracing his face. You looked at him confused.</p><p>\u201cWhat\nis..\u201d you began, but you were cut off.</p><p>Harry\nleaned in silencing you with a kiss. His lips were warm against\nyours, as he kissed you passionately. You melted into him, as you\nkissed him back with just as much passion. Pulling away, he placed\nhis forehead to yours. Trying to catch your breath, you closed your\neyes.</p><p>He\nbegan to chuckle. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d You asked amused.</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;ve\nbeen in love with you ever since the day I first laid eyes on you.\u201d\nHe confessed.</p><p>\u201cWait\nwhat??\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s\ntrue,\u201d he shrugged.</p><p>\u201cThen\nwhy haven&rsquo;t you ever said anything!\u201d You said incredibility.</p><p>\u201cI\nnever thought I deserved someone as amazing as you are.\u201d He said\nsincerely.</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d\nyou said with a shake of your head. \u201cYou deserve so much more. You\ndeserve the entire universe and so much more.\u201d</p><p>Reaching\nover, you ran your fingers over his cheek. He smiled at you fondly.\nSuddenly, he wrapped his arms around you and pulled you into his lap\nkissing you once more.</p><p>\u201cCan\nI officially call you mine now?\u201d He asked hopeful.</p><p>\u201cI\nmight be okay with that,\u201d you teased.</p><p>\u201cOh\nyou might?\u201d He said raising his brow. He started tickling your side\nagain. It was hard to put up a fight, when he had you in his lap. \u201cI\nwas kidding!\u201d You yelled.</p><p>Putting\nyour hand on either side of his face, you brought your lips to his.\n\u201cI would love nothing more than to be yours.\u201d</p><p>His\nanswering smile was heart warming, as he crushed you into his chest.\n\u201cNow you really need to be resting, my love. Your still burning\nup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill\nas bossy as ever.\u201d He chuckled.</p><p>\u201cThat,\nmy dear will never change! Now come!\u201d You told him raising to your\nfeet.</p><p>Leading\nhim to your room, you made him lay down. Turning off the lights, you\njoined him in the soft bed. You cuddled into his chest and relaxed\nimmediately.</p><p>\u201cI\ncould definitely get used to this,\u201d he hummed contently, pulling\nyou closer.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>You\nsmiled into his chest, as you drifted off into a peaceful slumber. \u00a0 \n</p>",

Going to the kitchen, you tried to busy yourself until your\nfamily arrived.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>You\nhad just finished removing cookies from the oven, when you heard the\ndoorbell ring. Rushing to answer it, you greeted your family.</p><p>\u201cY/n!\u201d\nYour dad called out first, giving you a big hug.</p><p>\u201cHey\ny/n,\u201d your step-mom came next. \u201cIt\u2019s smells wonderful in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank\nyou!\u201d You told her giving her a brief hug.</p><p>Your\nbrother and his wife were the next in line. Then came your sister and\nher new boyfriend. After greeting everyone, you led them to the\nliving room. Harry was sound asleep in the corner.</p><p>\u201cOh\nhey! Harry\u2019s here!\u201d Trina cheered. Your sister was a huge fan of\nHarry\u2019s and always stayed close by whenever he was around.</p><p>\u201cYes,\nbut he\u2019s not feeling well. So behave!\u201d You told her sternly. She\nstuck her tongue out at you, causing you to laugh. \u201cReal mature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre\nyou ever gonna tell that boy you\u2019re in love with him?\u201d She asked\ncurious.</p><p>\u201cTrina!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d\nShe said unashamed.</p><p>\u201cHarry\nand I are just friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\nyeah. Whatever you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright!\nEnough bickering you two.\u201d Your dad called out.</p><p>\u201cWhy\ndon\u2019t we start eating?\u201d You suggested.</p><p>Getting\nan agreement from everyone in the room, you motioned for them to head\ntowards the dining room.</p><p>\u201cWhat\nabout Harry?\u201d Trina asked disappointed.</p><p>\u201cHarry\nneeds to sleep. I\u2019ll fix him a plate later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwe\nlook at you all caring. Your so in love,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cOh\nhush!\u201d</p><p>Your\nfamily gathered around the table and passed around the food. The\nconversation flowed nicely. Your family had always been one to make\nfun of one another. The laughter was nonstop, as the jokes flew back\nand forth.</p><p>You\nenjoyed having your family over. You had always been a big family\nperson and found peace in the company you shared.</p><p>Once\ndinner was finished, and the dishes put away, you all headed back\ninto the living room. It was getting late, and it was time to open\npresents.</p><p>Heading\nto where Harry still laid, you quietly put your hand on his forehead.\nHis skin felt even hotter than it had before. Rushing back to the\nkitchen you got a glass of water and some medicine. Upon returning,\nyou nudged Harry.</p><p>\u201cHarry.\u201d\nYou shook him.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d\nHe responded turning his head towards you, with his eyes still\nclosed.</p><p>\u201cCome\non! Take this,\u201d you urged him.</p><p>Mumbling\nsome more he sat up on the couch and took the cup of water from you.</p><p>\u201cWhat\nis it?\u201d He asked looking at the pills questionably.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nmedicine! It\u2019ll make you feel better.\u201d He gave you a doubtful look.\n\u201cOh just take it, you big baby!\u201d</p><p>Grunting\nhe grabbed the pills from you and threw them into his mouth. \u201cYou\naren\u2019t trying to poison me are you?\u201d He asked after swallowing his\nmedicine.</p><p>\u201cI\nguess we\u2019ll find out,\u201d you teased. \u201cDo you feel well enough to\nopen presents with us?\u201d</p><p>He\nlooked around, at the mention of \u2018us\u2019. Seeing your family, he looked\na bit embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cY/n!\nWhy didn\u2019t you wake me when everyone got here?\u201d He whispered to\nyou.</p><p>\u201cYou\nneeded your rest.\u201d You stated simply.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Shaking\nhis head, he said a brief hello to each member of your family. Trina\nwas ecstatic that he was finally up. She came to sit in between the\ntwo of you and started to bombard him with questions. Rolling your\neyes, you gave Harry a look of pity. Deciding to save him, you tried\nto get her attention. \n</p><p>\u201cTrina,\nhow about we let Harry have a breather and open presents?\u201d At the\nmention of this, Trina leaped up with joy. You stared after your 17\nyear old sister in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cThank\nyou!\u201d Harry spoke softly so only you could hear.</p><p>\u201cAnytime,\u201d\nyou told him with a smile.</p><p>You\nremained by his side, as your dad started handing out presents. Harry\nleaned over and laid his head in your lap. You smiled down at him\nfondly, since he was looking away.</p><p>\u201cHow\nare you feeling?\u201d You asked running your fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cAwful,\u201d\nhe admitted finally.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nsorry dear.\u201d You told him worried.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nalright, you make it all better. Will you stay with me?\u201d He closed\nhis eyes and relaxed a bit into your lap.</p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d His skin felt as if it were on\nfire, and you desperately hoped the fever would soon break.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Harry\ndosed in and out of consciousness, as you watched your family unwrap\ntheir gifts. This had always been your favorite time of the year. You\nloved having your family around. Along with Harry, they were your\nfavorite people in the world. You just wished he felt better so he\ncould enjoy it with you as well.</p><p>You\nkept noticing your mom glancing at the two of you. She had a smirk on\nher face, and you knew what she had been thinking instantly.\nSecretly, your entire family had been routing for the two of you to\nget together. You had to admit, you wanted the same.</p><p>You\nand Harry had been best friends for as long as you could remember.\nYou couldn\u2019t remember a time where he wasn\u2019t a part of your life. He\nmeant the world to you, and you wanted more than anything to be the\none who made him the happiest.</p><p>You\nwatched for years as he dated girls that did nothing but use him.\nThey all seemed to be the same. They would date him long enough to be\nin the spotlight, and then leave him broken. It killed you that he\nfell for their lies and manipulation.</p><p>'If\nonly he could see how much you truly loved him for him.\u2019 You thought\nsadly.</p><p>It had\ngotten late, and your family were getting ready to leave. You started\nto get up, to tell them goodbye.</p><p>\u201cNoo\ndon\u2019t go,\u201d Harry whined half asleep. He grabbed your waist to keep\nyou there.</p><p>Laughing\nslightly, you looked at him sadly. He would never know how much it\nhurt you when he done things like this. He always grew quite clingy\nwhen he was drunk or unwell. You loved clingy Harry, but deep down\nknew that it would never mean the same to him as it did to you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll\nbe right back, I promise.\u201d You told him. He pouted further, but let\nyou go.</p><p>You\nquickly told your family to drive carefully and lead them out the\nfront. Your mom hung back briefly, as you watched the others head for\nthe car.</p><p>She\nsmiled at you, as she looked you over. \u201cOh just say it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney,\u201d\nshe started. \u201cI just hate seeing you like this. I don\u2019t want you to\nget hurt. I know you care for him, but you just have to take care of\nyourself as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nknow,\u201d you whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou\nknow I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nknow, I love you too mom.\u201d Giving her one final hug, you watched\nher leave.</p><p>Sighing,\nyou shut the door and returned to Harry. He was sound asleep once\nmore. Checking his head, you sighed with relief. His temperature was\nfinally starting to drop.</p><p>Checking\nthe time, you left him to get some more medicine. You also made him a\nbowl of soup. You knew that your mom had been right, but you couldn\u2019t\nhelp how you felt. You couldn\u2019t imagine your life without Harry. If\nthat meant you had to just be his friend, so be it.</p><p>Trying\nto clear your mind, you headed back to wake him. Setting his food on\nthe end table, you went to wake him.</p><p>\u201cHarryy,\u201d\nyou sung softly. \u201cTime to wake up!\u201d</p><p>He\ngroaned, but didn\u2019t budge. \u201cCome on sleepy head! You need to take\nsome more medicine and eat something.\u201d</p><p>Groaning\nonce more, he slowly sat up. He looked adorable, with his hair a mess\nand sleep in his eyes. Giving him the pills, he swallowed them\nwithout protest. \n</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d\nyou handed him the soup. \u201cYou need to eat something.\u201d His\nhesitation caused you to roll your eyes. \u201cOh come on! I made your\nfavorite, and you know I\u2019m not gonna stop until you finish it.\u201d</p><p>Sighing,\nhe took the bowl. He knew it would be pointless to fight a losing\nbattle. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be the death of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nwelcome!\u201d You told him smiling. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know what you\nwould do without me!\u201d</p><p>He\ngave you a shy smile. \u201cI don\u2019t either,\u201d he muttered. He has\nspoken so quietly that you weren\u2019t sure you had heard him correctly.</p><p>Finishing\nhis soup in silence, you decided to turn on a Christmas movie. He sat\naside his empty bowl and smirked at you. \u201cHappy now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost,\u201d\nyou told him smiling. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA\nbit better.\u201d He laid down, once more putting his head in your lap.\n\u201cThank you for taking care of me.\u201d He mumbled snuggling into you.</p><p>\u201cWhat\nare friends for,\u201d you told him sadly.</p><p>Sensing\nyour mood shift, he glanced up at you. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d He asked\nconcerned.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nnothing,\u201d you told him faking a smile.</p><p>\u201cEven\nwhen I\u2019m sick, I can still tell when your lying to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nnot lying.\u201d You told him sticking out your tongue.</p><p>\u201cI\nknow you didn\u2019t just stick your tongue out at me,\u201d he said with a\nwicked glint in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo\nwhat if I did?\u201d You said challenging him.</p><p>Slowly\nhe sat up, as he watched you. Without warning, he started to tickle\nyour sides.</p><p>\u201cHeyy!\u201d\nYou said protesting trying to fight him off.</p><p>\u201cSay\nyou\u2019re sorry,\u201d he said laughing.</p><p>\u201cNever!\u201d\nYou said between giggles.</p><p>He\ncontinued in his torment. \u201cI can do this all night,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d\nYou said giving in. \u201cI give up, but only because you\u2019re sick! I\u2019m sorry!\u201d</p><p>He\nlooked at you fondly. \u201cAnd?\u201d He prompted</p><p>\u201cAnd..\nHarry Styles is the most wonderful and sexy man of all time.\u201d\nYou told him automatically.</p><p>\u201cAnd\ndon\u2019t you forget it,\u201d he said with a smirk.</p><p>He was\njust inches from your face, causing your breath to catch in your\nthroat. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Rolling\nyour eyes, you looked away. This had not been the first time he had\nsaid those words, and your heart wanted so bad to believe him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nserious!\u201d He said turning your head back so he could look at you.\nHis face grew serious.</p><p>\u201cWell thank you, H.\u201d You leaned over and kissed his forehead gently.</p><p>His eyes slipped closed, and he gave you a shy smile. \u201cYou know I\u2019ve always been curious about\nsomething.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s\nthat?\u201d You whispered. Your heart was pounding out of your chest,\nand you were sure that he could hear it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve\nalways wondered what it would be like to kiss you.\u201d He confessed.</p><p>This\ntook you off guard. He looked sincere, but you knew it was too good\nto be true. \u201cThat must be the fever talking.\u201d You said laughing\nnervously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nserious!\u201d He said hurt. \u201cI\u2019ve always had a thing for you, and I\nwould never be able to forgive myself if I never told you how I\nfelt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry..\nPlease don\u2019t.\u201d You begged turning from him. Turning away, you felt\ntears prick your eyes.</p><p>\u201cY/n,\u201d\nhe whispered, trying to get your attention once more. Giving up, he\ndropped his hand. \u201cI understand if you don\u2019t feel the same.\u201d</p><p>The\nsilence lingered only briefly. Taking a deep breathe, you turned back\nto him. He looked hurt, as he took in the tears running down your\nface.</p><p>\u201cHey..\nplease don\u2019t cry.\u201d He begged wiping the tears from your cheek.</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d\nyou said finally, grabbing his hand. You held it to your face, as you\nclosed your eyes. \u201cHarry..\u201d You began again. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nknow,\u201d he whispered, \u201cand I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\nyou don\u2019t get it,\u201d you told him shaking your head. You looked into\nhis eyes with new determination. \u201cHarry.. I\u2019m in love with you. I\nhave been since we first became friends all those years ago. I just\nnever knew how to tell you. I didn\u2019t want to risk losing you.\u201d You\nconfessed quietly.</p><p>You\nlooked away, as you let him digest your words. The silence lingered.\nYour heart started to break, as you imagined the worst.</p><p>\u201cYou\ndon\u2019t have to say anything,\u201d you whispered. \u201cWe can just forget\nthis entire night, if you want.\u201d</p><p>The\nsilence was maddening. You finally made yourself look at him.\nGlancing towards him, you froze. He had the most breathtaking smile\ngracing his face. You looked at him confused.</p><p>\u201cWhat\nis..\u201d you began, but you were cut off.</p><p>Harry\nleaned in silencing you with a kiss. His lips were warm against\nyours, as he kissed you passionately. You melted into him, as you\nkissed him back with just as much passion. Pulling away, he placed\nhis forehead to yours. Trying to catch your breath, you closed your\neyes.</p><p>He\nbegan to chuckle. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d You asked amused.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve\nbeen in love with you ever since the day I first laid eyes on you.\u201d\nHe confessed.</p><p>\u201cWait\nwhat??\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\ntrue,\u201d he shrugged.</p><p>\u201cThen\nwhy haven\u2019t you ever said anything!\u201d You said incredibility.</p><p>\u201cI\nnever thought I deserved someone as amazing as you are.\u201d He said\nsincerely.</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d\nyou said with a shake of your head. \u201cYou deserve so much more. You\ndeserve the entire universe and so much more.\u201d</p><p>Reaching\nover, you ran your fingers over his cheek. He smiled at you fondly.\nSuddenly, he wrapped his arms around you and pulled you into his lap\nkissing you once more.</p><p>\u201cCan\nI officially call you mine now?\u201d He asked hopeful.</p><p>\u201cI\nmight be okay with that,\u201d you teased.</p><p>\u201cOh\nyou might?\u201d He said raising his brow. He started tickling your side\nagain. It was hard to put up a fight, when he had you in his lap. \u201cI\nwas kidding!\u201d You yelled.</p><p>Putting\nyour hand on either side of his face, you brought your lips to his.\n\u201cI would love nothing more than to be yours.\u201d</p><p>His\nanswering smile was heart warming, as he crushed you into his chest.\n\u201cNow you really need to be resting, my love. Your still burning\nup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill\nas bossy as ever.\u201d He chuckled.</p><p>\u201cThat,\nmy dear will never change! Now come!\u201d You told him raising to your\nfeet.</p><p>Leading\nhim to your room, you made him lay down. Turning off the lights, you\njoined him in the soft bed. You cuddled into his chest and relaxed\nimmediately.</p><p>\u201cI\ncould definitely get used to this,\u201d he hummed contently, pulling\nyou closer.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>You\nsmiled into his chest, as you drifted off into a peaceful slumber. \u00a0 \n</p></p>",

Looking at\nhis face, you frowned. \u201cHarry? What\u2019s wrong? Are you feeling okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nfine, just a wee bit of a cold.\u201d He pulled you into a warm hug.</p><p>\u201cAre\nyou sure?\u201d You asked, not convinced. Putting your hand to his cheek\nand then his forehead, you could feel the warmth radiating from him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nsure!\u201d He said brushing you off. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let a little\ncold ruin your family Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut..\u201d\nYou started to abject.</p><p>Putting\nhis finger over your mouth, he shook his head. \u201cNo buts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine!\nBut you have to go sit down and relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\nma'am\u201d He said sassy.</p><p>Rolling\nyour eyes, you pushed him towards the living room.

Deciding to save him, you tried\nto get her attention. \n</p><p>\u201cTrina,\nhow about we let Harry have a breather and open presents?\u201d At the\nmention of this, Trina leaped up with joy.

Will you stay with me?\u201d He closed\nhis eyes and relaxed a bit into your lap.</p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d His skin felt as if it were on\nfire, and you desperately hoped the fever would soon break.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Harry\ndosed in and out of consciousness, as you watched your family unwrap\ntheir gifts. This had always been your favorite time of the year. You\nloved having your family around. Along with Harry, they were your\nfavorite people in the world. You just wished he felt better so he\ncould enjoy it with you as well.</p><p>You\nkept noticing your mom glancing at the two of you. She had a smirk on\nher face, and you knew what she had been thinking instantly.\nSecretly, your entire family had been routing for the two of you to\nget together. You had to admit, you wanted the same.</p><p>You\nand Harry had been best friends for as long as you could remember.\nYou couldn\u2019t remember a time where he wasn\u2019t a part of your life. He\nmeant the world to you, and you wanted more than anything to be the\none who made him the happiest.</p><p>You\nwatched for years as he dated girls that did nothing but use him.\nThey all seemed to be the same. They would date him long enough to be\nin the spotlight, and then leave him broken. It killed you that he\nfell for their lies and manipulation.</p><p>'If\nonly he could see how much you truly loved him for him.\u2019 You thought\nsadly.</p><p>It had\ngotten late, and your family were getting ready to leave. You started\nto get up, to tell them goodbye.</p><p>\u201cNoo\ndon\u2019t go,\u201d Harry whined half asleep. He grabbed your waist to keep\nyou there.</p><p>Laughing\nslightly, you looked at him sadly. He would never know how much it\nhurt you when he done things like this. He always grew quite clingy\nwhen he was drunk or unwell. You loved clingy Harry, but deep down\nknew that it would never mean the same to him as it did to you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll\nbe right back, I promise.\u201d You told him. He pouted further, but let\nyou go.</p><p>You\nquickly told your family to drive carefully and lead them out the\nfront. Your mom hung back briefly, as you watched the others head for\nthe car.</p><p>She\nsmiled at you, as she looked you over. \u201cOh just say it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney,\u201d\nshe started. \u201cI just hate seeing you like this. I don\u2019t want you to\nget hurt. I know you care for him, but you just have to take care of\nyourself as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nknow,\u201d you whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou\nknow I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nknow, I love you too mom.\u201d Giving her one final hug, you watched\nher leave.</p><p>Sighing,\nyou shut the door and returned to Harry. He was sound asleep once\nmore. Checking his head, you sighed with relief. His temperature was\nfinally starting to drop.</p><p>Checking\nthe time, you left him to get some more medicine. You also made him a\nbowl of soup. You knew that your mom had been right, but you couldn\u2019t\nhelp how you felt. You couldn\u2019t imagine your life without Harry. If\nthat meant you had to just be his friend, so be it.</p><p>Trying\nto clear your mind, you headed back to wake him. Setting his food on\nthe end table, you went to wake him.</p><p>\u201cHarryy,\u201d\nyou sung softly. \u201cTime to wake up!\u201d</p><p>He\ngroaned, but didn\u2019t budge. \u201cCome on sleepy head! You need to take\nsome more medicine and eat something.\u201d</p><p>Groaning\nonce more, he slowly sat up. He looked adorable, with his hair a mess\nand sleep in his eyes. Giving him the pills, he swallowed them\nwithout protest. \n</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d\nyou handed him the soup. \u201cYou need to eat something.\u201d His\nhesitation caused you to roll your eyes. \u201cOh come on! I made your\nfavorite, and you know I\u2019m not gonna stop until you finish it.\u201d</p><p>Sighing,\nhe took the bowl. He knew it would be pointless to fight a losing\nbattle. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be the death of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nwelcome!\u201d You told him smiling. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know what you\nwould do without me!\u201d</p><p>He\ngave you a shy smile. \u201cI don\u2019t either,\u201d he muttered. He has\nspoken so quietly that you weren\u2019t sure you had heard him correctly.</p><p>Finishing\nhis soup in silence, you decided to turn on a Christmas movie. He sat\naside his empty bowl and smirked at you. \u201cHappy now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost,\u201d\nyou told him smiling. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA\nbit better.\u201d He laid down, once more putting his head in your lap.\n\u201cThank you for taking care of me.\u201d He mumbled snuggling into you.</p><p>\u201cWhat\nare friends for,\u201d you told him sadly.</p><p>Sensing\nyour mood shift, he glanced up at you. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d He asked\nconcerned.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nnothing,\u201d you told him faking a smile.</p><p>\u201cEven\nwhen I\u2019m sick, I can still tell when your lying to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nnot lying.\u201d You told him sticking out your tongue.</p><p>\u201cI\nknow you didn\u2019t just stick your tongue out at me,\u201d he said with a\nwicked glint in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo\nwhat if I did?\u201d You said challenging him.</p><p>Slowly\nhe sat up, as he watched you. Without warning, he started to tickle\nyour sides.</p><p>\u201cHeyy!\u201d\nYou said protesting trying to fight him off.</p><p>\u201cSay\nyou\u2019re sorry,\u201d he said laughing.</p><p>\u201cNever!\u201d\nYou said between giggles.</p><p>He\ncontinued in his torment. \u201cI can do this all night,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d\nYou said giving in. \u201cI give up, but only because you\u2019re sick! I\u2019m sorry!\u201d</p><p>He\nlooked at you fondly. \u201cAnd?\u201d He prompted</p><p>\u201cAnd..\nHarry Styles is the most wonderful and sexy man of all time.\u201d\nYou told him automatically.</p><p>\u201cAnd\ndon\u2019t you forget it,\u201d he said with a smirk.</p><p>He was\njust inches from your face, causing your breath to catch in your\nthroat. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Rolling\nyour eyes, you looked away. This had not been the first time he had\nsaid those words, and your heart wanted so bad to believe him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nserious!\u201d He said turning your head back so he could look at you.\nHis face grew serious.</p><p>\u201cWell thank you, H.\u201d You leaned over and kissed his forehead gently.</p><p>His eyes slipped closed, and he gave you a shy smile. \u201cYou know I\u2019ve always been curious about\nsomething.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s\nthat?\u201d You whispered. Your heart was pounding out of your chest,\nand you were sure that he could hear it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve\nalways wondered what it would be like to kiss you.\u201d He confessed.</p><p>This\ntook you off guard. He looked sincere, but you knew it was too good\nto be true. \u201cThat must be the fever talking.\u201d You said laughing\nnervously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nserious!\u201d He said hurt. \u201cI\u2019ve always had a thing for you, and I\nwould never be able to forgive myself if I never told you how I\nfelt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry..\nPlease don\u2019t.\u201d You begged turning from him. Turning away, you felt\ntears prick your eyes.</p><p>\u201cY/n,\u201d\nhe whispered, trying to get your attention once more. Giving up, he\ndropped his hand. \u201cI understand if you don\u2019t feel the same.\u201d</p><p>The\nsilence lingered only briefly. Taking a deep breathe, you turned back\nto him. He looked hurt, as he took in the tears running down your\nface.</p><p>\u201cHey..\nplease don\u2019t cry.\u201d He begged wiping the tears from your cheek.</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d\nyou said finally, grabbing his hand. You held it to your face, as you\nclosed your eyes. \u201cHarry..\u201d You began again. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nknow,\u201d he whispered, \u201cand I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\nyou don\u2019t get it,\u201d you told him shaking your head. You looked into\nhis eyes with new determination. \u201cHarry.. I\u2019m in love with you. I\nhave been since we first became friends all those years ago. I just\nnever knew how to tell you. I didn\u2019t want to risk losing you.\u201d You\nconfessed quietly.</p><p>You\nlooked away, as you let him digest your words. The silence lingered.\nYour heart started to break, as you imagined the worst.</p><p>\u201cYou\ndon\u2019t have to say anything,\u201d you whispered. \u201cWe can just forget\nthis entire night, if you want.\u201d</p><p>The\nsilence was maddening. You finally made yourself look at him.\nGlancing towards him, you froze. He had the most breathtaking smile\ngracing his face. You looked at him confused.</p><p>\u201cWhat\nis..\u201d you began, but you were cut off.</p><p>Harry\nleaned in silencing you with a kiss. His lips were warm against\nyours, as he kissed you passionately. You melted into him, as you\nkissed him back with just as much passion. Pulling away, he placed\nhis forehead to yours. Trying to catch your breath, you closed your\neyes.</p><p>He\nbegan to chuckle. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d You asked amused.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve\nbeen in love with you ever since the day I first laid eyes on you.\u201d\nHe confessed.</p><p>\u201cWait\nwhat??\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\ntrue,\u201d he shrugged.</p><p>\u201cThen\nwhy haven\u2019t you ever said anything!\u201d You said incredibility.</p><p>\u201cI\nnever thought I deserved someone as amazing as you are.\u201d He said\nsincerely.</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d\nyou said with a shake of your head. \u201cYou deserve so much more. You\ndeserve the entire universe and so much more.\u201d</p><p>Reaching\nover, you ran your fingers over his cheek. He smiled at you fondly.\nSuddenly, he wrapped his arms around you and pulled you into his lap\nkissing you once more.</p><p>\u201cCan\nI officially call you mine now?\u201d He asked hopeful.</p><p>\u201cI\nmight be okay with that,\u201d you teased.</p><p>\u201cOh\nyou might?\u201d He said raising his brow. He started tickling your side\nagain.

You just wished he felt better so he\ncould enjoy it with you as well.</p><p>You\nkept noticing your mom glancing at the two of you. She had a smirk on\nher face, and you knew what she had been thinking instantly.\nSecretly, your entire family had been routing for the two of you to\nget together. You had to admit, you wanted the same.</p><p>You\nand Harry had been best friends for as long as you could remember.\nYou couldn&rsquo;t remember a time where he wasn&rsquo;t a part of your life. He\nmeant the world to you, and you wanted more than anything to be the\none who made him the happiest.</p><p>You\nwatched for years as he dated girls that did nothing but use him.\nThey all seemed to be the same. They would date him long enough to be\nin the spotlight, and then leave him broken. It killed you that he\nfell for their lies and manipulation.</p><p>'If\nonly he could see how much you truly loved him for him.&rsquo; You thought\nsadly.</p><p>It had\ngotten late, and your family were getting ready to leave. You started\nto get up, to tell them goodbye.</p><p>&ldquo;Noo\ndon&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; Harry whined half asleep. He grabbed your waist to keep\nyou there.</p><p>Laughing\nslightly, you looked at him sadly. He would never know how much it\nhurt you when he done things like this. He always grew quite clingy\nwhen he was drunk or unwell. You loved clingy Harry, but deep down\nknew that it would never mean the same to him as it did to you.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll\nbe right back, I promise.&rdquo; You told him. He pouted further, but let\nyou go.</p><p>You\nquickly told your family to drive carefully and lead them out the\nfront. Your mom hung back briefly, as you watched the others head for\nthe car.</p><p>She\nsmiled at you, as she looked you over. &ldquo;Oh just say it!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Honey,&rdquo;\nshe started. &ldquo;I just hate seeing you like this. I don&rsquo;t want you to\nget hurt. I know you care for him, but you just have to take care of\nyourself as well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\nknow,&rdquo; you whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;You\nknow I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\nknow, I love you too mom.&rdquo; Giving her one final hug, you watched\nher leave.</p><p>Sighing,\nyou shut the door and returned to Harry. He was sound asleep once\nmore. Checking his head, you sighed with relief. His temperature was\nfinally starting to drop.</p><p>Checking\nthe time, you left him to get some more medicine. You also made him a\nbowl of soup. You knew that your mom had been right, but you couldn&rsquo;t\nhelp how you felt. You couldn&rsquo;t imagine your life without Harry. If\nthat meant you had to just be his friend, so be it.</p><p>Trying\nto clear your mind, you headed back to wake him. Setting his food on\nthe end table, you went to wake him.</p><p>&ldquo;Harryy,&rdquo;\nyou sung softly. &ldquo;Time to wake up!&rdquo;</p><p>He\ngroaned, but didn&rsquo;t budge. &ldquo;Come on sleepy head! You need to take\nsome more medicine and eat something.&rdquo;</p><p>Groaning\nonce more, he slowly sat up. He looked adorable, with his hair a mess\nand sleep in his eyes. Giving him the pills, he swallowed them\nwithout protest. \n</p><p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo;\nyou handed him the soup. &ldquo;You need to eat something.&rdquo; His\nhesitation caused you to roll your eyes. &ldquo;Oh come on! I made your\nfavorite, and you know I&rsquo;m not gonna stop until you finish it.&rdquo;</p><p>Sighing,\nhe took the bowl. He knew it would be pointless to fight a losing\nbattle. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be the death of me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re\nwelcome!&rdquo; You told him smiling. &ldquo;I honestly don&rsquo;t know what you\nwould do without me!&rdquo;</p><p>He\ngave you a shy smile. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t either,&rdquo; he muttered. He has\nspoken so quietly that you weren&rsquo;t sure you had heard him correctly.</p><p>Finishing\nhis soup in silence, you decided to turn on a Christmas movie. He sat\naside his empty bowl and smirked at you. &ldquo;Happy now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Almost,&rdquo;\nyou told him smiling. &ldquo;How are you feeling?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A\nbit better.&rdquo; He laid down, once more putting his head in your lap.\n&ldquo;Thank you for taking care of me.&rdquo; He mumbled snuggling into you.</p><p>&ldquo;What\nare friends for,&rdquo; you told him sadly.</p><p>Sensing\nyour mood shift, he glanced up at you. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; He asked\nconcerned.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nnothing,&rdquo; you told him faking a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Even\nwhen I&rsquo;m sick, I can still tell when your lying to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nnot lying.&rdquo; You told him sticking out your tongue.</p><p>&ldquo;I\nknow you didn&rsquo;t just stick your tongue out at me,&rdquo; he said with a\nwicked glint in his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;So\nwhat if I did?&rdquo; You said challenging him.</p><p>Slowly\nhe sat up, as he watched you. Without warning, he started to tickle\nyour sides.</p><p>&ldquo;Heyy!&rdquo;\nYou said protesting trying to fight him off.</p><p>&ldquo;Say\nyou&rsquo;re sorry,&rdquo; he said laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo;\nYou said between giggles.</p><p>He\ncontinued in his torment. &ldquo;I can do this all night,&rdquo; he warned.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo;\nYou said giving in. &ldquo;I give up, but only because you&rsquo;re sick! I&rsquo;m sorry!&rdquo;</p><p>He\nlooked at you fondly. &ldquo;And?&rdquo; He prompted</p><p>&ldquo;And..\nHarry Styles is the most wonderful and sexy man of all time.&rdquo;\nYou told him automatically.</p><p>&ldquo;And\ndon&rsquo;t you forget it,&rdquo; he said with a smirk.</p><p>He was\njust inches from your face, causing your breath to catch in your\nthroat. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so beautiful,&rdquo; he whispered.</p><p>Rolling\nyour eyes, you looked away. This had not been the first time he had\nsaid those words, and your heart wanted so bad to believe him.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nserious!&rdquo; He said turning your head back so he could look at you.\nHis face grew serious.</p><p>&ldquo;Well thank you, H.&rdquo; You leaned over and kissed his forehead gently.</p><p>His eyes slipped closed, and he gave you a shy smile. &ldquo;You know I&rsquo;ve always been curious about\nsomething.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s\nthat?&rdquo; You whispered. Your heart was pounding out of your chest,\nand you were sure that he could hear it.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve\nalways wondered what it would be like to kiss you.&rdquo; He confessed.</p><p>This\ntook you off guard. He looked sincere, but you knew it was too good\nto be true. &ldquo;That must be the fever talking.&rdquo; You said laughing\nnervously.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nserious!&rdquo; He said hurt. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always had a thing for you, and I\nwould never be able to forgive myself if I never told you how I\nfelt.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry..\nPlease don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; You begged turning from him. Turning away, you felt\ntears prick your eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n,&rdquo;\nhe whispered, trying to get your attention once more. Giving up, he\ndropped his hand. &ldquo;I understand if you don&rsquo;t feel the same.&rdquo;</p><p>The\nsilence lingered only briefly. Taking a deep breathe, you turned back\nto him. He looked hurt, as he took in the tears running down your\nface.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey..\nplease don&rsquo;t cry.&rdquo; He begged wiping the tears from your cheek.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry,&rdquo;\nyou said finally, grabbing his hand. You held it to your face, as you\nclosed your eyes. &ldquo;Harry..&rdquo; You began again. &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\nknow,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;and I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No\nyou don&rsquo;t get it,&rdquo; you told him shaking your head. You looked into\nhis eyes with new determination. &ldquo;Harry.. I&rsquo;m in love with you. I\nhave been since we first became friends all those years ago. I just\nnever knew how to tell you. I didn&rsquo;t want to risk losing you.&rdquo; You\nconfessed quietly.</p><p>You\nlooked away, as you let him digest your words. The silence lingered.\nYour heart started to break, as you imagined the worst.</p><p>&ldquo;You\ndon&rsquo;t have to say anything,&rdquo; you whispered. &ldquo;We can just forget\nthis entire night, if you want.&rdquo;</p><p>The\nsilence was maddening. You finally made yourself look at him.\nGlancing towards him, you froze. He had the most breathtaking smile\ngracing his face. You looked at him confused.</p><p>&ldquo;What\nis..&rdquo; you began, but you were cut off.</p><p>Harry\nleaned in silencing you with a kiss. His lips were warm against\nyours, as he kissed you passionately. You melted into him, as you\nkissed him back with just as much passion. Pulling away, he placed\nhis forehead to yours. Trying to catch your breath, you closed your\neyes.</p><p>He\nbegan to chuckle. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; You asked amused.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve\nbeen in love with you ever since the day I first laid eyes on you.&rdquo;\nHe confessed.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait\nwhat??&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\ntrue,&rdquo; he shrugged.</p><p>&ldquo;Then\nwhy haven&rsquo;t you ever said anything!&rdquo; You said incredibility.</p><p>&ldquo;I\nnever thought I deserved someone as amazing as you are.&rdquo; He said\nsincerely.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry,&rdquo;\nyou said with a shake of your head. &ldquo;You deserve so much more. You\ndeserve the entire universe and so much more.&rdquo;</p><p>Reaching\nover, you ran your fingers over his cheek. He smiled at you fondly.\nSuddenly, he wrapped his arms around you and pulled you into his lap\nkissing you once more.</p><p>&ldquo;Can\nI officially call you mine now?&rdquo; He asked hopeful.</p><p>&ldquo;I\nmight be okay with that,&rdquo; you teased.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh\nyou might?&rdquo; He said raising his brow. He started tickling your side\nagain. It was hard to put up a fight, when he had you in his lap. &ldquo;I\nwas kidding!&rdquo; You yelled.</p><p>Putting\nyour hand on either side of his face, you brought your lips to his.\n&ldquo;I would love nothing more than to be yours.&rdquo;</p><p>His\nanswering smile was heart warming, as he crushed you into his chest.\n&ldquo;Now you really need to be resting, my love. Your still burning\nup.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Still\nas bossy as ever.&rdquo; He chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;That,\nmy dear will never change! Now come!&rdquo; You told him raising to your\nfeet.</p><p>Leading\nhim to your room, you made him lay down. Turning off the lights, you\njoined him in the soft bed. You cuddled into his chest and relaxed\nimmediately.</p><p>&ldquo;I\ncould definitely get used to this,&rdquo; he hummed contently, pulling\nyou closer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You\nsmiled into his chest, as you drifted off into a peaceful slumber. &nbsp; \n</p></p>",
