(also Downton Abbey, but I had a bitter break up with that show so we don&rsquo;t talk about it)</p></blockquote><p>\n\n11. Who is your current OTP?\n\n<br /></p><blockquote><p>I don&rsquo;t have ships. I have an armada. Filled with many different OTP&rsquo;s that can chose to make a ruckus at any given time! Though usually they sit quietly until I see something that revives the feelings about them that I&rsquo;ve so carefully tucked away.&nbsp;</p><p>But right now Lucien/Jean from Doctor Blake Mysteries are still pretty raw or Oksana/Eve from Killing Eve (I only watched it a couple weeks ago so my feelings are not very well anchored yet) Also Thomas/Margaret from Murdoch Mysteries - the latest season just concluded and they went through a rough season and gosh darn it RECONCILE YOU DUMB DUMBS! Oh also Matthew/Diana from A Discovery of Witches - I finished the newest book recently and it revived my feelings for these two!</p></blockquote><p>\n\n18. What ship have you written the most about?\n\n<br /></p><blockquote><p>I had a brief foray into fanfiction when I was completely and utterly obsessed with the Warriors books, back in elementary school. Since then not much. BUT the ship that I think I have created the most fan art/edits for is either Fitzwilliam/Elizabeth - Pride and Prejudice or William/Julia&nbsp;&ldquo;Jilliam&rdquo; - Murdoch Mysteries&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>\n\n30. What inspires you to write?\n\n<br /></p><blockquote><p>Music mainly or the characters themselves. Often times quotes/events from the shows or other media spark an idea into me as well to create! (have a tag for quotes that i see here that inspire me so when I&rsquo;m really stuck I go through and read through those again)&nbsp; Also reading fanfiction and seeing other people&rsquo;s edits/fan art can be really inspiring as well.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></p>",
