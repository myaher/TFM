The piercer counted down and it was one of the worst pains you went through. \u201cOW SON OF A BITCH!\u201d you yelled out and squeezed tightly onto Peter\u2019s hand.

Peter and Ned were just exiting the school perimeter, chatting to one another peacefully after an exhausting few hours of classes and enjoying each others company as per usual.</p><p>It had been about 3 months after the airport incident, fortunately for Peter, Mr Stark had let the kid keep the new suit permanently, releasing the boy back to his every day with some confusing advice and&hellip;that was it. He hadn\u2019t heard from the man since, or from Happy either, no matter how many times Peter texted them, called them- they left him with nothing.</p><p>He was bored with everyday crime fighting, he wanted more, he needed a rush, he needed something.</p><p>Every time those kinds of thoughts rushed into his head, he thought back to (Name). He didn\u2019t know why exactly, but one thing he did know for sure was that (Name)\u2019s attitude screamed adventure, vigour, excitement. He told himself that was the reason why that he wanted something more and (Name) was most likely the one who would give him more, it was no other reason.</p><p>Yet, his mind also wandered to other thoughts about her. Where was she now? He was still being sent those&hellip;packages, so there was no way she was captured, right? So what was she doing?&hellip; Did she miss him? Did she, maybe&hellip;miss his scent? He missed hers, though he would never admit it, that sweet, sweet scent. God, he wished that he could smell it now-</p><p>\u201cPeter? Are you even listening?\u201d</p><p>Peter jumped, blinking his eyes hard and sending a smile- well more of a grimace- towards Ned. \u201cUh, sorry I was&hellip;thinking about the Stark Internship\u201d</p><p>Ned\u2019s face dropped \u201cDoes this mean you can\u2019t come over and help me build the Lego Death Star?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?- No! No, no, no, I can come over today\u201d I need a break from Spider-man anyway \u201cWhat time? Do you want me to come now-\u201d</p><p>Freshly baked pastries: danishes, croissants, cupcakes, cake, doughnuts. The scent was so incredibly sweet, it hit him hard and when he said hard, he meant hard, like he had been punched right in the face by it, the boy had even stopped dead in his tracks.</p><p>He knew that smell but, she couldn\u2019t be&hellip;the Accords made her a fugitive of the country and if she was here she would be arrested, she wouldn\u2019t risk her freedom to come here, right-</p><p>\u201cWell, well, well, if it isn\u2019t Mr Parker himself\u201d</p><p>Peter went rigid; Ned glanced over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAnd his friend, by the looks of it\u201d</p><p>Peter turned slowly, watching as a casual dressed (Name) strolled past him while offering her hand towards Ned. \u201cThe name\u2019s (Name), Ned, right?\u201d</p><p>Ned smiled kindly towards the girl in return before taking her hand and giving it a firm shake \u201cYeah, that\u2019s me, nice to meet you, although-\u201d</p><p>Peter tried to ignore the look that his best friend sent him \u201cPeter hasn\u2019t told me about you\u201d</p><p>(Name) let out a simple laugh as she threw her arm over Peter\u2019s shoulders, tugging him closer to her own frame and patting his chest with her free hand. \u201cAh, well, Parker, he likes to keep little secrets here and there, you know?\u201d</p><p>Ned nodded in agreement; Peter sent her a warning glare.</p><p>\u201cAnyhow- I saw you two walking and I was like \u2018Parker!? Is that really him!?\u2019 and I just had to see! Say \u2018hi\u2019 if you will! And, well, now I think lunch would be appropriate for this sudden meeting, the three of us, I\u2019ll pay, how does that sound, Parker?\u201d (Name) shook the boy playfully, mischief dancing in her eyes as the two shared eye contact for a moment.</p><p>Peter\u2019s lip curled \u201cGreat\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome!\u201d Removing her arm from Peter, (Name) strolled up to Ned and they walked ahead, Peter sulking behind them with his eyes trained hard onto (Name).</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019d you meet Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, a great story, It was during the Stark Internship retreat in Germany, the company I interned for was invited for a conference-\u201d</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-<b></b></p><p>\u201cAh shit\u201d Ned whined, glancing at his phone with a grimace \u201cMy mom\u2019s calling, I\u2019ve gotta go\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Do you want me to come with you? We can work on the Lego Death Star!\u201d Peter offered, beginning to stand from his seat, only for Ned to wave him off with a smile.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cool, you hang with (Name) and we can do it later\u201d</p><p>(Name) smiled towards Ned \u201cIt was really nice to officially meet you, Ned\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was nice to meet you too, (Name), I\u2019ll see you guys later!\u201d</p><p>Sharing mutual farewells, Ned stood from his seat and exited the cafe, waving at them when he passed the window their booth had been seated next to before disappearing from sight in the concrete jungle. Peter\u2019s smile dropped once his friend had disappeared while (Name)\u2019s own smile morphed into a mischievous smirk, head coming to rest on her intertwined hands as Peter leaned forward.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?!\u201d He whispered desperately, eyes wandering all over the cafe and to the street outside \u201cIs Captain America here too? That guy with the metal arm-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPause it, Parker, I\u2019ve only got one mouth\u201d (Name) laughed, sending him a wink \u201cAnd no, Steve and Bucky aren\u2019t with me, they\u2019re at a classified location\u201d</p><p>Peter let out a hard breath and collapsed back into his seat, eyeing the girl warily \u201cWhy are you here, (Name)?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoohhh, he\u2019s using the hero voice\u201d</p><p>\u201c(Name)-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay\u201d With a laugh, she sat back up and her hand dived into her jacket pocket \u201cI\u2019m setting up a base here, well, nearby and I was scoping out the area\u201d</p><p>She pulled out a thick envelope and tossed it over, watching in amusement as the boy quickly snatched it before shoving it into his backpack \u201cI also came to drop that off personally, seeing as I was here already\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you keep giving me this money?\u201d He asked, glancing over to his bag nervously.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think?\u201d She sent back, giving him a look. \u201cYou saved my life, Parker, least I could do\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to\u201d (Name) gestured for a waitress to come over, \u201cEnd of discussion\u201d</p><p>Peter sat silently for the next few moments as (Name) ordered another drink, exchanging polite chat with the waitress before turning back to Peter with a sheepish expression.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d She started with a laugh \u201cYou see, my new base is gonna take a while to set up and, you see, I need a place to stay while that happens, so, I was wondering\u2026\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widened \u201cWait, what!? No! You can\u2019t stay at my place!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwh, come on Parker!\u201d (Name) pouted, \u201cIt\u2019ll only be for a short while, three months tops!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree months-\u201d The waitress appeared with (Name)\u2019s drink, the both of them immediately silencing themselves and watching her walk away awkwardly before turning back to one another \u201c(Name), I can\u2019t let you stay at my home!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Is it because of the rent? \u2018Cause I can pay, you know I can-\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Peter groaned, hands flying up to hold his face. \u201cNo it\u2019s not that- it\u2019s just- what would I say to my aunt? \u2018Hey Aunt May, this is (Name), she\u2019s a national fugitive who I saved a few months back- Oh, hey, can she stay with us!?\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can come up with something\u201d (Name) reassured, grabbing his hands and pulling them away to look him in the eye \u201cCome on, Parker- Parker look at me- you can trust me, as soon as it\u2019s over, I\u2019ll be out of your hair, I promise, you\u2019ll never have to see me again\u201d</p><p>\u201c&hellip;never\u2026?\u201d The boy asked, his expression dropping.</p><p>\u201cOkay, maybe not never, I\u2019ll probably be living a few blocks away or something- just-&hellip;please?\u201d (Name) sent him a genuine pleading look \u201cThis is probably the only place that my old-&hellip;employer, won\u2019t look, I just need a few months\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s expression softened and he bit the inside of his cheek. He couldn\u2019t do this, he shouldn\u2019t do this, (Name) was a national criminal, hell, she was basically a worldwide criminal. If he did this, he would get in so much trouble, he could drag May into this mess if he wasn\u2019t careful and it would all end in disaster.</p><p>This was a bad idea.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-<br/></p><p>Fuck, this was such a bad idea.</p><p>\u201cHey, May?\u201d Peter called into the apartment, pushing open the front door and allowing (Name) to trail behind him into the front room. \u201cAre you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d The sound of footsteps approached them and May turned the corner with her usual warm smile plastered on her face. \u201cHow was- Oh! Hello!\u201d</p><p>(Name) recuperated the woman\u2019s smile, though it resembled more of a wince than anything, part of the plan. The story was that (Name) had been kicked out from her abusive home a few weeks ago and was looking for a place to stay, Peter, being the sweetheart he was, had offered that they could stay with them for a while until she eventually saved enough money to get a place of her own.</p><p>It was a good idea but it had put a bad taste in his mouth. May was a bleeding heart, if she saw that someone was in trouble she would always try to help that someone out and at the moment, the two were using that to their advantage. Peter didn\u2019t like lying to her, hell, not telling her that he was Spiderman was hard enough, but not telling her that he wanted to harbour a fugitive in their home? That was way worse than hiding any secret identity.</p><p>\u201cUm- H-hi!\u201d (Name) stuttered, rubbing her arm awkwardly \u201cYou m-must be Mis- Miss Parker! It\u2019s- well I- um\u2026\u201d</p><p>Was&hellip;was she shaking?</p><p>Damn, she was good.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay, (Name)\u201d Peter squeezed the girl affectionately, feeling her melt under his touch and place her head on his shoulder, nuzzling into his neck softly. \u201cSorry, May, she\u2019s just really shy\u201d</p><p>May smiled in understanding and nodded her head. God, why was he doing this again? \u201cThat\u2019s okay, sweetie, why don\u2019t you sit down, I\u2019ll get you something to drink\u201d</p><p>\u201cT-Thank you\u201d (Name) whispered, plopping down on the sofa as May walked off to the kitchen, Peter following behind with a heavy weight of guilt slowly beginning to form on his shoulders.\u00a0</p><p>Well, here goes nothing.</p><p>\u201cSo, who is she?\u201d His aunt purred playfully, looking through their assortment of drinks within the refrigerator \u201cShe smells like an omega, is she your mate?\u201d</p><p>She wiggled her eyebrows towards him and a bright blush painted itself onto his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No! No, no no, she\u2019s just a friend from around, her family moved here a few months ago\u201d May let out a hum that displayed her disbelief, turning back to the fridge \u201cMay, I\u2019m being serious!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you are, Petey\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously! I- Ugh! Nevermind, I needed to ask you something important\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, sweetie\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you see, I was wondering-\u201d Peter glanced back into the living room, seeing (Name) look around the place before leaning closer to his aunt to whisper \u201cWould it be okay if (Name) stayed here for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d His aunt stared at him oddly \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Peter swallowed the saliva that was bundling in his throat. May didn\u2019t seem mad or annoyed, more confused with his request than anything and he begged the Gods that it would stay that way.</p><p>\u201cWell, uh\u2026\u201d The boy gestured for his aunt to move a little further away from their guest, continuing to speak in hushed voices as they addressed one another \u201c(Name) hasn&rsquo;t been around for a while and I, well, I found out today that her father kicked her out\u201d</p><p>A look of utter horror flashed over his aunt\u2019s face and his chest squeezed painfully.</p><p>\u201cHe did what?\u201d May took a glance towards the girl \u201cHow could he do that?\u201d</p><p>Oh God this was harder than he thought.</p><p>\u201cI-I&hellip;I convinced her to stand up to him\u201d He replied quietly, his voice close to a whimper \u201cShe told me that he was hurting her and I told her that she shouldn\u2019t take that from him and she stood up for herself and I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter\u201d The older woman placed a comforting hand on his shoulder, her other pushing some stray strands of hair behind his ear \u201cThis isn\u2019t you fault\u201d</p><p>A little voice in the back of his head told him otherwise.</p><p>\u201cBut-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts\u201d May argued, pushing him towards the living room to where (Name) was seated \u201cGo and comfort her, I\u2019ll get her a drink\u201d</p><p>\u201cO-Okay\u201d</p><p>\u2018God, I\u2019m so sorry, May\u2019</p><p>Peter trudged back over towards the sofa, letting himself collapse next to the girl with an exhausted huff. (Name), once she had seen that the boy\u2019s aunt was distracted, leaned against the boy with a similar huff.</p><p>\u201cCome on, sour puss\u201d She whined \u201cDon\u2019t pout, it\u2019s only for a short while\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that\u201d (Name) looked at him dubiously, \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t feel right lying to her like this\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven though you lie to her every day about your whereabouts after school and how you\u2019re Spiderman\u201d</p><p>The boy deflated into his seat with a noise of distress and (Name) rolled her eyes.\t</p><p>What was the point of hiding the other you in front of loved ones? The real you? (Name) never really understood. I mean, if you had told the people you loved that you were X, Y, Z, wouldn\u2019t it be better for them to prepare themselves for oncoming threats?</p><p>It happened all the damn time in movies. The hero\u2019s family, friends, lover, etc. were kept in the dark and they were kidnapped or held hostage, or some other stupid occurrence that could have been avoided if the hero had been smart and just told the truth.</p><p>It really pissed her off.</p><p>But she\u2019d keep up with the damn act.</p><p>If that was what Peter really wanted.</p><p>\u201cListen\u201d (Name) whispered into his ear, Peter\u2019s form going rigid under her touch \u201cHow about I let you in on a little secret, Mr Spidey\u201d</p><p>\u201c(N-Name)-\u201d</p><p>The girl hushed him softly and raked her hand through his brown locks.\u00a0</p><p>God, she loved to tease the poor boy, any little touch, a slight change in tone, a little saucy word or two sent his heartbeat into a frenzy and turned the colour of his skin from that cute tan to a beautiful shade of rosy red. Oh, he was just so adorable!</p><p>With a soft giggle, she grinned against the shell of his ear \u201cWhat you said wasn\u2019t a complete lie\u201d</p><p>Then she had pulled away, a nervous smile once again tugging at her lips as May sauntered back into the room \u201cI hope you\u2019re okay with orange juice, it\u2019s all we really had\u201d</p><p>\u201cT-That\u2019s fine! Thank you Miss Par-Parker\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, call me, May, (Name)\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, o-of course\u201d</p><p>\u201c&hellip;Peter are you okay, you look a little upset?\u201d</p><p>The boy waved off his aunt, sending her an apologetic smile, even when thoughts stormed through his head.</p><p>What did (Name) mean by that?</p>",

The scent was so incredibly sweet, it hit him hard and when he said hard, he meant hard, like he had been punched right in the face by it, the boy had even stopped dead in his tracks.</p><p>He knew that smell but, she couldn\u2019t be\u2026the Accords made her a fugitive of the country and if she was here she would be arrested, she wouldn\u2019t risk her freedom to come here, right-</p><p>\u201cWell, well, well, if it isn\u2019t Mr Parker himself\u201d</p><p>Peter went rigid; Ned glanced over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAnd his friend, by the looks of it\u201d</p><p>Peter turned slowly, watching as a casual dressed (Name) strolled past him while offering her hand towards Ned. \u201cThe name\u2019s (Name), Ned, right?\u201d</p><p>Ned smiled kindly towards the girl in return before taking her hand and giving it a firm shake \u201cYeah, that\u2019s me, nice to meet you, although-\u201d</p><p>Peter tried to ignore the look that his best friend sent him \u201cPeter hasn\u2019t told me about you\u201d</p><p>(Name) let out a simple laugh as she threw her arm over Peter\u2019s shoulders, tugging him closer to her own frame and patting his chest with her free hand. \u201cAh, well, Parker, he likes to keep little secrets here and there, you know?\u201d</p><p>Ned nodded in agreement; Peter sent her a warning glare.</p><p>\u201cAnyhow- I saw you two walking and I was like \u2018Parker!? Is that really him!?\u2019 and I just had to see! Say \u2018hi\u2019 if you will! And, well, now I think lunch would be appropriate for this sudden meeting, the three of us, I\u2019ll pay, how does that sound, Parker?\u201d (Name) shook the boy playfully, mischief dancing in her eyes as the two shared eye contact for a moment.</p><p>Peter\u2019s lip curled \u201cGreat\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome!\u201d Removing her arm from Peter, (Name) strolled up to Ned and they walked ahead, Peter sulking behind them with his eyes trained hard onto (Name).</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019d you meet Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, a great story, It was during the Stark Internship retreat in Germany, the company I interned for was invited for a conference-\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<b></b></p><p>\u201cAh shit\u201d Ned whined, glancing at his phone with a grimace \u201cMy mom\u2019s calling, I\u2019ve gotta go\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Do you want me to come with you? We can work on the Lego Death Star!\u201d Peter offered, beginning to stand from his seat, only for Ned to wave him off with a smile.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cool, you hang with (Name) and we can do it later\u201d</p><p>(Name) smiled towards Ned \u201cIt was really nice to officially meet you, Ned\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was nice to meet you too, (Name), I\u2019ll see you guys later!\u201d</p><p>Sharing mutual farewells, Ned stood from his seat and exited the cafe, waving at them when he passed the window their booth had been seated next to before disappearing from sight in the concrete jungle. Peter\u2019s smile dropped once his friend had disappeared while (Name)\u2019s own smile morphed into a mischievous smirk, head coming to rest on her intertwined hands as Peter leaned forward.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?!\u201d He whispered desperately, eyes wandering all over the cafe and to the street outside \u201cIs Captain America here too? That guy with the metal arm-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPause it, Parker, I\u2019ve only got one mouth\u201d (Name) laughed, sending him a wink \u201cAnd no, Steve and Bucky aren\u2019t with me, they\u2019re at a classified location\u201d</p><p>Peter let out a hard breath and collapsed back into his seat, eyeing the girl warily \u201cWhy are you here, (Name)?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoohhh, he\u2019s using the hero voice\u201d</p><p>\u201c(Name)-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay\u201d With a laugh, she sat back up and her hand dived into her jacket pocket \u201cI\u2019m setting up a base here, well, nearby and I was scoping out the area\u201d</p><p>She pulled out a thick envelope and tossed it over, watching in amusement as the boy quickly snatched it before shoving it into his backpack \u201cI also came to drop that off personally, seeing as I was here already\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you keep giving me this money?\u201d He asked, glancing over to his bag nervously.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think?\u201d She sent back, giving him a look. \u201cYou saved my life, Parker, least I could do\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to\u201d (Name) gestured for a waitress to come over, \u201cEnd of discussion\u201d</p><p>Peter sat silently for the next few moments as (Name) ordered another drink, exchanging polite chat with the waitress before turning back to Peter with a sheepish expression.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d She started with a laugh \u201cYou see, my new base is gonna take a while to set up and, you see, I need a place to stay while that happens, so, I was wondering\u2026\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widened \u201cWait, what!? No! You can\u2019t stay at my place!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwh, come on Parker!\u201d (Name) pouted, \u201cIt\u2019ll only be for a short while, three months tops!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree months-\u201d The waitress appeared with (Name)\u2019s drink, the both of them immediately silencing themselves and watching her walk away awkwardly before turning back to one another \u201c(Name), I can\u2019t let you stay at my home!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Is it because of the rent? \u2018Cause I can pay, you know I can-\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Peter groaned, hands flying up to hold his face. \u201cNo it\u2019s not that- it\u2019s just- what would I say to my aunt? \u2018Hey Aunt May, this is (Name), she\u2019s a national fugitive who I saved a few months back- Oh, hey, can she stay with us!?\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can come up with something\u201d (Name) reassured, grabbing his hands and pulling them away to look him in the eye \u201cCome on, Parker- Parker look at me- you can trust me, as soon as it\u2019s over, I\u2019ll be out of your hair, I promise, you\u2019ll never have to see me again\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026never\u2026?\u201d The boy asked, his expression dropping.</p><p>\u201cOkay, maybe not never, I\u2019ll probably be living a few blocks away or something- just-\u2026please?\u201d (Name) sent him a genuine pleading look \u201cThis is probably the only place that my old-\u2026employer, won\u2019t look, I just need a few months\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s expression softened and he bit the inside of his cheek. He couldn\u2019t do this, he shouldn\u2019t do this, (Name) was a national criminal, hell, she was basically a worldwide criminal. If he did this, he would get in so much trouble, he could drag May into this mess if he wasn\u2019t careful and it would all end in disaster.</p><p>This was a bad idea.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br></p><p>Fuck, this was such a bad idea.</p><p>\u201cHey, May?\u201d Peter called into the apartment, pushing open the front door and allowing (Name) to trail behind him into the front room. \u201cAre you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d The sound of footsteps approached them and May turned the corner with her usual warm smile plastered on her face. \u201cHow was- Oh! Hello!\u201d</p><p>(Name) recuperated the woman\u2019s smile, though it resembled more of a wince than anything, part of the plan. The story was that (Name) had been kicked out from her abusive home a few weeks ago and was looking for a place to stay, Peter, being the sweetheart he was, had offered that they could stay with them for a while until she eventually saved enough money to get a place of her own.</p><p>It was a good idea but it had put a bad taste in his mouth. May was a bleeding heart, if she saw that someone was in trouble she would always try to help that someone out and at the moment, the two were using that to their advantage. Peter didn\u2019t like lying to her, hell, not telling her that he was Spiderman was hard enough, but not telling her that he wanted to harbour a fugitive in their home? That was way worse than hiding any secret identity.</p><p>\u201cUm- H-hi!\u201d (Name) stuttered, rubbing her arm awkwardly \u201cYou m-must be Mis- Miss Parker! It\u2019s- well I- um\u2026\u201d</p><p>Was\u2026was she shaking?</p><p>Damn, she was good.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay, (Name)\u201d Peter squeezed the girl affectionately, feeling her melt under his touch and place her head on his shoulder, nuzzling into his neck softly. \u201cSorry, May, she\u2019s just really shy\u201d</p><p>May smiled in understanding and nodded her head. God, why was he doing this again? \u201cThat\u2019s okay, sweetie, why don\u2019t you sit down, I\u2019ll get you something to drink\u201d</p><p>\u201cT-Thank you\u201d (Name) whispered, plopping down on the sofa as May walked off to the kitchen, Peter following behind with a heavy weight of guilt slowly beginning to form on his shoulders.\u00a0</p><p>Well, here goes nothing.</p><p>\u201cSo, who is she?\u201d His aunt purred playfully, looking through their assortment of drinks within the refrigerator \u201cShe smells like an omega, is she your mate?\u201d</p><p>She wiggled her eyebrows towards him and a bright blush painted itself onto his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No! No, no no, she\u2019s just a friend from around, her family moved here a few months ago\u201d May let out a hum that displayed her disbelief, turning back to the fridge \u201cMay, I\u2019m being serious!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you are, Petey\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously! I- Ugh! Nevermind, I needed to ask you something important\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, sweetie\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you see, I was wondering-\u201d Peter glanced back into the living room, seeing (Name) look around the place before leaning closer to his aunt to whisper \u201cWould it be okay if (Name) stayed here for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d His aunt stared at him oddly \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Peter swallowed the saliva that was bundling in his throat. May didn\u2019t seem mad or annoyed, more confused with his request than anything and he begged the Gods that it would stay that way.</p><p>\u201cWell, uh\u2026\u201d The boy gestured for his aunt to move a little further away from their guest, continuing to speak in hushed voices as they addressed one another \u201c(Name) hasn\u2019t been around for a while and I, well, I found out today that her father kicked her out\u201d</p><p>A look of utter horror flashed over his aunt\u2019s face and his chest squeezed painfully.</p><p>\u201cHe did what?\u201d May took a glance towards the girl \u201cHow could he do that?\u201d</p><p>Oh God this was harder than he thought.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2026I convinced her to stand up to him\u201d He replied quietly, his voice close to a whimper \u201cShe told me that he was hurting her and I told her that she shouldn\u2019t take that from him and she stood up for herself and I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter\u201d The older woman placed a comforting hand on his shoulder, her other pushing some stray strands of hair behind his ear \u201cThis isn\u2019t you fault\u201d</p><p>A little voice in the back of his head told him otherwise.</p><p>\u201cBut-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts\u201d May argued, pushing him towards the living room to where (Name) was seated \u201cGo and comfort her, I\u2019ll get her a drink\u201d</p><p>\u201cO-Okay\u201d</p><p>\u2018God, I\u2019m so sorry, May\u2019</p><p>Peter trudged back over towards the sofa, letting himself collapse next to the girl with an exhausted huff. (Name), once she had seen that the boy\u2019s aunt was distracted, leaned against the boy with a similar huff.</p><p>\u201cCome on, sour puss\u201d She whined \u201cDon\u2019t pout, it\u2019s only for a short while\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that\u201d (Name) looked at him dubiously, \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t feel right lying to her like this\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven though you lie to her every day about your whereabouts after school and how you\u2019re Spiderman\u201d</p><p>The boy deflated into his seat with a noise of distress and (Name) rolled her eyes.\t</p><p>What was the point of hiding the other you in front of loved ones? The real you? (Name) never really understood. I mean, if you had told the people you loved that you were X, Y, Z, wouldn\u2019t it be better for them to prepare themselves for oncoming threats?</p><p>It happened all the damn time in movies. The hero\u2019s family, friends, lover, etc. were kept in the dark and they were kidnapped or held hostage, or some other stupid occurrence that could have been avoided if the hero had been smart and just told the truth.</p><p>It really pissed her off.</p><p>But she\u2019d keep up with the damn act.</p><p>If that was what Peter really wanted.</p><p>\u201cListen\u201d (Name) whispered into his ear, Peter\u2019s form going rigid under her touch \u201cHow about I let you in on a little secret, Mr Spidey\u201d</p><p>\u201c(N-Name)-\u201d</p><p>The girl hushed him softly and raked her hand through his brown locks.\u00a0</p><p>God, she loved to tease the poor boy, any little touch, a slight change in tone, a little saucy word or two sent his heartbeat into a frenzy and turned the colour of his skin from that cute tan to a beautiful shade of rosy red. Oh, he was just so adorable!</p><p>With a soft giggle, she grinned against the shell of his ear \u201cWhat you said wasn\u2019t a complete lie\u201d</p><p>Then she had pulled away, a nervous smile once again tugging at her lips as May sauntered back into the room \u201cI hope you\u2019re okay with orange juice, it\u2019s all we really had\u201d</p><p>\u201cT-That\u2019s fine! Thank you Miss Par-Parker\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, call me, May, (Name)\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, o-of course\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026Peter are you okay, you look a little upset?\u201d</p><p>The boy waved off his aunt, sending her an apologetic smile, even when thoughts stormed through his head.</p><p>What did (Name) mean by that?</p>",

Peter and Ned were just exiting the school perimeter, chatting to one another peacefully after an exhausting few hours of classes and enjoying each others company as per usual.</p><p>It had been about 3 months after the airport incident, fortunately for Peter, Mr Stark had let the kid keep the new suit permanently, releasing the boy back to his every day with some confusing advice and\u2026that was it. He hadn\u2019t heard from the man since, or from Happy either, no matter how many times Peter texted them, called them- they left him with nothing.</p><p>He was bored with everyday crime fighting, he wanted more, he needed a rush, he needed something.</p><p>Every time those kinds of thoughts rushed into his head, he thought back to (Name). He didn\u2019t know why exactly, but one thing he did know for sure was that (Name)\u2019s attitude screamed adventure, vigour, excitement. He told himself that was the reason why that he wanted something more and (Name) was most likely the one who would give him more, it was no other reason.</p><p>Yet, his mind also wandered to other thoughts about her. Where was she now? He was still being sent those\u2026packages, so there was no way she was captured, right? So what was she doing?\u2026 Did she miss him? Did she, maybe\u2026miss his scent? He missed hers, though he would never admit it, that sweet, sweet scent. God, he wished that he could smell it now-</p><p>\u201cPeter? Are you even listening?\u201d</p><p>Peter jumped, blinking his eyes hard and sending a smile- well more of a grimace- towards Ned. \u201cUh, sorry I was\u2026thinking about the Stark Internship\u201d</p><p>Ned\u2019s face dropped \u201cDoes this mean you can\u2019t come over and help me build the Lego Death Star?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?- No! No, no, no, I can come over today\u201d I need a break from Spider-man anyway \u201cWhat time? Do you want me to come now-\u201d</p><p>Freshly baked pastries: danishes, croissants, cupcakes, cake, doughnuts.

Do you want me to come with you?

No!

Is it because of the rent? \u2018Cause I can pay, you know I can-\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Peter groaned, hands flying up to hold his face. \u201cNo it\u2019s not that- it\u2019s just- what would I say to my aunt? \u2018Hey Aunt May, this is (Name), she\u2019s a national fugitive who I saved a few months back- Oh, hey, can she stay with us!?\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can come up with something\u201d (Name) reassured, grabbing his hands and pulling them away to look him in the eye \u201cCome on, Parker- Parker look at me- you can trust me, as soon as it\u2019s over, I\u2019ll be out of your hair, I promise, you\u2019ll never have to see me again\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026never\u2026?\u201d The boy asked, his expression dropping.</p><p>\u201cOkay, maybe not never, I\u2019ll probably be living a few blocks away or something- just-\u2026please?\u201d (Name) sent him a genuine pleading look \u201cThis is probably the only place that my old-\u2026employer, won\u2019t look, I just need a few months\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s expression softened and he bit the inside of his cheek. He couldn\u2019t do this, he shouldn\u2019t do this, (Name) was a national criminal, hell, she was basically a worldwide criminal. If he did this, he would get in so much trouble, he could drag May into this mess if he wasn\u2019t careful and it would all end in disaster.</p><p>This was a bad idea.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br></p><p>Fuck, this was such a bad idea.</p><p>\u201cHey, May?\u201d Peter called into the apartment, pushing open the front door and allowing (Name) to trail behind him into the front room. \u201cAre you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d The sound of footsteps approached them and May turned the corner with her usual warm smile plastered on her face. \u201cHow was- Oh! Hello!\u201d</p><p>(Name) recuperated the woman\u2019s smile, though it resembled more of a wince than anything, part of the plan. The story was that (Name) had been kicked out from her abusive home a few weeks ago and was looking for a place to stay, Peter, being the sweetheart he was, had offered that they could stay with them for a while until she eventually saved enough money to get a place of her own.</p><p>It was a good idea but it had put a bad taste in his mouth. May was a bleeding heart, if she saw that someone was in trouble she would always try to help that someone out and at the moment, the two were using that to their advantage. Peter didn\u2019t like lying to her, hell, not telling her that he was Spiderman was hard enough, but not telling her that he wanted to harbour a fugitive in their home? That was way worse than hiding any secret identity.</p><p>\u201cUm- H-hi!\u201d (Name) stuttered, rubbing her arm awkwardly \u201cYou m-must be Mis- Miss Parker! It\u2019s- well I- um\u2026\u201d</p><p>Was\u2026was she shaking?</p><p>Damn, she was good.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay, (Name)\u201d Peter squeezed the girl affectionately, feeling her melt under his touch and place her head on his shoulder, nuzzling into his neck softly. \u201cSorry, May, she\u2019s just really shy\u201d</p><p>May smiled in understanding and nodded her head. God, why was he doing this again? \u201cThat\u2019s okay, sweetie, why don\u2019t you sit down, I\u2019ll get you something to drink\u201d</p><p>\u201cT-Thank you\u201d (Name) whispered, plopping down on the sofa as May walked off to the kitchen, Peter following behind with a heavy weight of guilt slowly beginning to form on his shoulders.\u00a0</p><p>Well, here goes nothing.</p><p>\u201cSo, who is she?\u201d His aunt purred playfully, looking through their assortment of drinks within the refrigerator \u201cShe smells like an omega, is she your mate?\u201d</p><p>She wiggled her eyebrows towards him and a bright blush painted itself onto his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No! No, no no, she\u2019s just a friend from around, her family moved here a few months ago\u201d May let out a hum that displayed her disbelief, turning back to the fridge \u201cMay, I\u2019m being serious!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you are, Petey\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously! I- Ugh! Nevermind, I needed to ask you something important\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, sweetie\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you see, I was wondering-\u201d Peter glanced back into the living room, seeing (Name) look around the place before leaning closer to his aunt to whisper \u201cWould it be okay if (Name) stayed here for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d His aunt stared at him oddly \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Peter swallowed the saliva that was bundling in his throat. May didn\u2019t seem mad or annoyed, more confused with his request than anything and he begged the Gods that it would stay that way.</p><p>\u201cWell, uh\u2026\u201d The boy gestured for his aunt to move a little further away from their guest, continuing to speak in hushed voices as they addressed one another \u201c(Name) hasn\u2019t been around for a while and I, well, I found out today that her father kicked her out\u201d</p><p>A look of utter horror flashed over his aunt\u2019s face and his chest squeezed painfully.</p><p>\u201cHe did what?\u201d May took a glance towards the girl \u201cHow could he do that?\u201d</p><p>Oh God this was harder than he thought.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2026I convinced her to stand up to him\u201d He replied quietly, his voice close to a whimper \u201cShe told me that he was hurting her and I told her that she shouldn\u2019t take that from him and she stood up for herself and I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter\u201d The older woman placed a comforting hand on his shoulder, her other pushing some stray strands of hair behind his ear \u201cThis isn\u2019t you fault\u201d</p><p>A little voice in the back of his head told him otherwise.</p><p>\u201cBut-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts\u201d May argued, pushing him towards the living room to where (Name) was seated \u201cGo and comfort her, I\u2019ll get her a drink\u201d</p><p>\u201cO-Okay\u201d</p><p>\u2018God, I\u2019m so sorry, May\u2019</p><p>Peter trudged back over towards the sofa, letting himself collapse next to the girl with an exhausted huff. (Name), once she had seen that the boy\u2019s aunt was distracted, leaned against the boy with a similar huff.</p><p>\u201cCome on, sour puss\u201d She whined \u201cDon\u2019t pout, it\u2019s only for a short while\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that\u201d (Name) looked at him dubiously, \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t feel right lying to her like this\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven though you lie to her every day about your whereabouts after school and how you\u2019re Spiderman\u201d</p><p>The boy deflated into his seat with a noise of distress and (Name) rolled her eyes.\t</p><p>What was the point of hiding the other you in front of loved ones? The real you? (Name) never really understood. I mean, if you had told the people you loved that you were X, Y, Z, wouldn\u2019t it be better for them to prepare themselves for oncoming threats?</p><p>It happened all the damn time in movies. The hero\u2019s family, friends, lover, etc. were kept in the dark and they were kidnapped or held hostage, or some other stupid occurrence that could have been avoided if the hero had been smart and just told the truth.</p><p>It really pissed her off.</p><p>But she\u2019d keep up with the damn act.</p><p>If that was what Peter really wanted.</p><p>\u201cListen\u201d (Name) whispered into his ear, Peter\u2019s form going rigid under her touch \u201cHow about I let you in on a little secret, Mr Spidey\u201d</p><p>\u201c(N-Name)-\u201d</p><p>The girl hushed him softly and raked her hand through his brown locks.\u00a0</p><p>God, she loved to tease the poor boy, any little touch, a slight change in tone, a little saucy word or two sent his heartbeat into a frenzy and turned the colour of his skin from that cute tan to a beautiful shade of rosy red. Oh, he was just so adorable!</p><p>With a soft giggle, she grinned against the shell of his ear \u201cWhat you said wasn\u2019t a complete lie\u201d</p><p>Then she had pulled away, a nervous smile once again tugging at her lips as May sauntered back into the room \u201cI hope you\u2019re okay with orange juice, it\u2019s all we really had\u201d</p><p>\u201cT-That\u2019s fine! Thank you Miss Par-Parker\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, call me, May, (Name)\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, o-of course\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026Peter are you okay, you look a little upset?\u201d</p><p>The boy waved off his aunt, sending her an apologetic smile, even when thoughts stormed through his head.</p><p>What did (Name) mean by that?</p>",

Hello!&rdquo;</p><p>(Name) recuperated the woman&rsquo;s smile, though it resembled more of a wince than anything, part of the plan. The story was that (Name) had been kicked out from her abusive home a few weeks ago and was looking for a place to stay, Peter, being the sweetheart he was, had offered that they could stay with them for a while until she eventually saved enough money to get a place of her own.</p><p>It was a good idea but it had put a bad taste in his mouth. May was a bleeding heart, if she saw that someone was in trouble she would always try to help that someone out and at the moment, the two were using that to their advantage. Peter didn&rsquo;t like lying to her, hell, not telling her that he was Spiderman was hard enough, but not telling her that he wanted to harbour a fugitive in their home? That was way worse than hiding any secret identity.</p><p>&ldquo;Um- H-hi!&rdquo; (Name) stuttered, rubbing her arm awkwardly &ldquo;You m-must be Mis- Miss Parker! It&rsquo;s- well I- um&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Was&hellip;was she shaking?</p><p>Damn, she was good.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s okay, (Name)&rdquo; Peter squeezed the girl affectionately, feeling her melt under his touch and place her head on his shoulder, nuzzling into his neck softly. &ldquo;Sorry, May, she&rsquo;s just really shy&rdquo;</p><p>May smiled in understanding and nodded her head. God, why was he doing this again? &ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay, sweetie, why don&rsquo;t you sit down, I&rsquo;ll get you something to drink&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;T-Thank you&rdquo; (Name) whispered, plopping down on the sofa as May walked off to the kitchen, Peter following behind with a heavy weight of guilt slowly beginning to form on his shoulders.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, here goes nothing.</p><p>&ldquo;So, who is she?&rdquo; His aunt purred playfully, looking through their assortment of drinks within the refrigerator &ldquo;She smells like an omega, is she your mate?&rdquo;</p><p>She wiggled her eyebrows towards him and a bright blush painted itself onto his face.</p><p>&ldquo;What? No! No, no no, she&rsquo;s just a friend from around, her family moved here a few months ago&rdquo; May let out a hum that displayed her disbelief, turning back to the fridge &ldquo;May, I&rsquo;m being serious!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you are, Petey&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Seriously! I- Ugh! Nevermind, I needed to ask you something important&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go ahead, sweetie&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you see, I was wondering-&rdquo; Peter glanced back into the living room, seeing (Name) look around the place before leaning closer to his aunt to whisper &ldquo;Would it be okay if (Name) stayed here for a while?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; His aunt stared at him oddly &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter swallowed the saliva that was bundling in his throat. May didn&rsquo;t seem mad or annoyed, more confused with his request than anything and he begged the Gods that it would stay that way.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, uh&hellip;&rdquo; The boy gestured for his aunt to move a little further away from their guest, continuing to speak in hushed voices as they addressed one another &ldquo;(Name) hasn&rsquo;t been around for a while and I, well, I found out today that her father kicked her out&rdquo;</p><p>A look of utter horror flashed over his aunt&rsquo;s face and his chest squeezed painfully.</p><p>&ldquo;He did what?&rdquo; May took a glance towards the girl &ldquo;How could he do that?&rdquo;</p><p>Oh God this was harder than he thought.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I&hellip;I convinced her to stand up to him&rdquo; He replied quietly, his voice close to a whimper &ldquo;She told me that he was hurting her and I told her that she shouldn&rsquo;t take that from him and she stood up for herself and I-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter&rdquo; The older woman placed a comforting hand on his shoulder, her other pushing some stray strands of hair behind his ear &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t you fault&rdquo;</p><p>A little voice in the back of his head told him otherwise.</p><p>&ldquo;But-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No buts&rdquo; May argued, pushing him towards the living room to where (Name) was seated &ldquo;Go and comfort her, I&rsquo;ll get her a drink&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;O-Okay&rdquo;</p><p>&lsquo;God, I&rsquo;m so sorry, May&rsquo;</p><p>Peter trudged back over towards the sofa, letting himself collapse next to the girl with an exhausted huff. (Name), once she had seen that the boy&rsquo;s aunt was distracted, leaned against the boy with a similar huff.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, sour puss&rdquo; She whined &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pout, it&rsquo;s only for a short while&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that&rdquo; (Name) looked at him dubiously, &ldquo;It just doesn&rsquo;t feel right lying to her like this&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Even though you lie to her every day about your whereabouts after school and how you&rsquo;re Spiderman&rdquo;</p><p>The boy deflated into his seat with a noise of distress and (Name) rolled her eyes.\t</p><p>What was the point of hiding the other you in front of loved ones? The real you? (Name) never really understood. I mean, if you had told the people you loved that you were X, Y, Z, wouldn&rsquo;t it be better for them to prepare themselves for oncoming threats?</p><p>It happened all the damn time in movies. The hero&rsquo;s family, friends, lover, etc. were kept in the dark and they were kidnapped or held hostage, or some other stupid occurrence that could have been avoided if the hero had been smart and just told the truth.</p><p>It really pissed her off.</p><p>But she&rsquo;d keep up with the damn act.</p><p>If that was what Peter really wanted.</p><p>&ldquo;Listen&rdquo; (Name) whispered into his ear, Peter&rsquo;s form going rigid under her touch &ldquo;How about I let you in on a little secret, Mr Spidey&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;(N-Name)-&rdquo;</p><p>The girl hushed him softly and raked her hand through his brown locks.&nbsp;</p><p>God, she loved to tease the poor boy, any little touch, a slight change in tone, a little saucy word or two sent his heartbeat into a frenzy and turned the colour of his skin from that cute tan to a beautiful shade of rosy red. Oh, he was just so adorable!</p><p>With a soft giggle, she grinned against the shell of his ear &ldquo;What you said wasn&rsquo;t a complete lie&rdquo;</p><p>Then she had pulled away, a nervous smile once again tugging at her lips as May sauntered back into the room &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re okay with orange juice, it&rsquo;s all we really had&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;T-That&rsquo;s fine! Thank you Miss Par-Parker&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please, call me, May, (Name)&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, o-of course&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;Peter are you okay, you look a little upset?&rdquo;</p><p>The boy waved off his aunt, sending her an apologetic smile, even when thoughts stormed through his head.</p><p>What did (Name) mean by that?</p>",
