Norman Osborn never looked forward to any party. As much as he put on a brave face and had cooly insisted to his son Harry when he was a small lad and protesting why he had to go, that these social events were important, he himself secretly didn\u2019t find any joy in them. Sure they were an opportunity to mingle with very important people, building his image and getting potential funding, but the idea of spending even more time around people he was at best lukewarm with and at worst despised, just made him crave some hard liquor.</p><p>An hour had passed and after a quick whiskey at the bar, Norman straightened his tie as he prepped to start up his mingling again. Distracting himself from the dread of forcing more conversation with various board members, he focused on his tie a moment. Red with intricate golden patterns, not too tacky but Christmasy enough. Well, it just bordered on tacky for Norman, but he figured Chloe would get a kick out of it and find it cute at least.</p><p>That made Norman pause for a second as he realised he hadn\u2019t seen his secretary-turned-friend tonight yet. She said she\u2019d be there during their regular lunchtime get-together, but no sign of her so far. Still, the party had just started, there was plenty of time for her to show. Just he was a bit anxious to ramble on to someone he trusted rather than lead another conversation with a colder executive.</p><p>Another half hour and Norman once again swiftly turned away from another VIP, his big cheesy grin just as soon turning into a tired scowl. He almost sighed with relief at seeing his son nearby, chatting up an older couple Norman recognised as a board member and her husband, laughing as the younger Osborn finished some anecdote. As much as Harry didn\u2019t show any drive in pursuing the sciences Norman pushed him towards, he had to admit, he was a natural at mingling with people at least.</p><p>And those people skills were on display as Harry twigged that Norman was getting tired of mingling himself, so he stuck to his dad for a bit to make it look like they were busy talking. As the two waded through the large and crowded venue, Norman was in the middle of a quiet little vent to Harry about the unrealistic demands set by some investor he talked to, until he trailed off as his sharp blue eyes became transfixed by a sight nearby.</p><p>On a long sofa seat only a few feet in front of them sat Chloe, only instead of her black pencil skirt and white button-up shirt, a tight red dress hugged her from her lace sleeves all the way down to her knees, subtly patterned with flowers. It showed off all her curves and made her already large cleavage pop, but even her face was a lovely sight. Wavy blonde hair and soft and subtle make-up on her kind face, she smiled at nothing in particular as she sat with a drink in her hand and looked around her, looking as sweet and approachable as ever.</p><p>Still, she hadn\u2019t yet noticed Norman, which he considered a blessing as he was currently standing there dumbstruck. He admittedly did find her attractive even before, and knew for a time that he was developing some, dare he say, <i>romantic</i> feelings for his friend. But maybe it was all that tension building up and coming to the front with how especially womanly she looked tonight. Maybe it was some Christmas magic in the air. Or maybe it was the Maker\u2019s Mark making him dizzy. But that familiar spark he felt for her during tender moments was bursting inside of him.</p><p>Even if Chloe was admittedly too dreamy to notice Norman at a distance, one person did notice him however, and he was currently nudging Norman in the side and wearing a large smirk.</p><p>\u201cLooks like Chloe cleans up pretty good, huh dad?\u201d Harry teased, still nudging his father before moving his hands to his suit trouser pockets, waiting for Norman to reply.</p><p>Norman quickly turned his head to Harry before just as quickly turning his gaze back to Chloe. \u201cMmm, yes\u201d, he replied trying to sound as stern as he could but still much dreamier than he could control. \u201cShe looks lovely.\u201d</p><p>A few seconds passed before Harry got impatient. \u201cUhhh &hellip; dad?\u201d, he prodded, motioning his head in Chloe\u2019s direction, hoping Norman would look to him and get the idea.</p><p>At that Norman did turn his head to Harry and lightly glared at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeez dad, you\u2019re the genius here\u201d, Harry snarked, \u201cGo talk to your <i>friend</i>.\u201d He emphasised the last word with a wink, making Norman scowl though clearly blush a bit harder. He didn\u2019t need his son teasing him right now especially, but before he could say anything, Harry walked off, \u2018leaving the lovebirds to it\u2019. Norman wanted to debate him right then and there but he had already sauntered off into the crowd.</p><p>Norman looked to Chloe again and the thought hit him with how silly he was being. After all, she\u2019s been his friend for a time now and she always liked to see him. Tonight would be no different, no matter how &hellip; well, <i>romantic</i> this all felt. Straightening up, Norman took a deep breath and walked over towards her, as casually as he could but still ending up practically marching over. He thought for a moment that a board member tried to butt in from the side to talk to him, but it was too late, he\u2019d set his goal to reach Chloe and to enjoy himself for the first time this evening.</p><p>As he neared, Chloe noticed her friend and boss finally and grinned at him. After putting her drink down on the table in front of her, she finished Norman\u2019s journey for him, walking up to him as he approached and taking him into a big tight hug.</p>",

Distracting himself from the dread of forcing more conversation with various board members, he focused on his tie a moment. Red with intricate golden patterns, not too tacky but Christmasy enough. Well, it just bordered on tacky for Norman, but he figured Chloe would get a kick out of it and find it cute at least.</p><p>That made Norman pause for a second as he realised he hadn&rsquo;t seen his secretary-turned-friend tonight yet. She said she&rsquo;d be there during their regular lunchtime get-together, but no sign of her so far. Still, the party had just started, there was plenty of time for her to show. Just he was a bit anxious to ramble on to someone he trusted rather than lead another conversation with a colder executive.</p><p>Another half hour and Norman once again swiftly turned away from another VIP, his big cheesy grin just as soon turning into a tired scowl. He almost sighed with relief at seeing his son nearby, chatting up an older couple Norman recognised as a board member and her husband, laughing as the younger Osborn finished some anecdote. As much as Harry didn&rsquo;t show any drive in pursuing the sciences Norman pushed him towards, he had to admit, he was a natural at mingling with people at least.</p><p>And those people skills were on display as Harry twigged that Norman was getting tired of mingling himself, so he stuck to his dad for a bit to make it look like they were busy talking. As the two waded through the large and crowded venue, Norman was in the middle of a quiet little vent to Harry about the unrealistic demands set by some investor he talked to, until he trailed off as his sharp blue eyes became transfixed by a sight nearby.</p><p>On a long sofa seat only a few feet in front of them sat Chloe, only instead of her black pencil skirt and white button-up shirt, a tight red dress hugged her from her lace sleeves all the way down to her knees, subtly patterned with flowers. It showed off all her curves and made her already large cleavage pop, but even her face was a lovely sight. Wavy blonde hair and soft and subtle make-up on her kind face, she smiled at nothing in particular as she sat with a drink in her hand and looked around her, looking as sweet and approachable as ever.</p><p>Still, she hadn&rsquo;t yet noticed Norman, which he considered a blessing as he was currently standing there dumbstruck. He admittedly did find her attractive even before, and knew for a time that he was developing some, dare he say, <i>romantic</i> feelings for his friend. But maybe it was all that tension building up and coming to the front with how especially womanly she looked tonight. Maybe it was some Christmas magic in the air. Or maybe it was the Maker&rsquo;s Mark making him dizzy. But that familiar spark he felt for her during tender moments was bursting inside of him.</p><p>Even if Chloe was admittedly too dreamy to notice Norman at a distance, one person did notice him however, and he was currently nudging Norman in the side and wearing a large smirk.</p><p>&ldquo;Looks like Chloe cleans up pretty good, huh dad?&rdquo; Harry teased, still nudging his father before moving his hands to his suit trouser pockets, waiting for Norman to reply.</p><p>Norman quickly turned his head to Harry before just as quickly turning his gaze back to Chloe. &ldquo;Mmm, yes&rdquo;, he replied trying to sound as stern as he could but still much dreamier than he could control. &ldquo;She looks lovely.&rdquo;</p><p>A few seconds passed before Harry got impatient. &ldquo;Uhhh &hellip; dad?&rdquo;, he prodded, motioning his head in Chloe&rsquo;s direction, hoping Norman would look to him and get the idea.</p><p>At that Norman did turn his head to Harry and lightly glared at him.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Geez dad, you&rsquo;re the genius here&rdquo;, Harry snarked, &ldquo;Go talk to your <i>friend</i>.&rdquo; He emphasised the last word with a wink, making Norman scowl though clearly blush a bit harder. He didn&rsquo;t need his son teasing him right now especially, but before he could say anything, Harry walked off, &lsquo;leaving the lovebirds to it&rsquo;. Norman wanted to debate him right then and there but he had already sauntered off into the crowd.</p><p>Norman looked to Chloe again and the thought hit him with how silly he was being. After all, she&rsquo;s been his friend for a time now and she always liked to see him. Tonight would be no different, no matter how &hellip; well, <i>romantic</i> this all felt. Straightening up, Norman took a deep breath and walked over towards her, as casually as he could but still ending up practically marching over. He thought for a moment that a board member tried to butt in from the side to talk to him, but it was too late, he&rsquo;d set his goal to reach Chloe and to enjoy himself for the first time this evening.</p><p>As he neared, Chloe noticed her friend and boss finally and grinned at him. After putting her drink down on the table in front of her, she finished Norman&rsquo;s journey for him, walking up to him as he approached and taking him into a big tight hug.</p>",
