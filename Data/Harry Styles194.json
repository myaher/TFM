I know it\u2019s been a long time since I posted but I needed to catch up on writing, but it\u2019s here now and chapter 15 (the last chapter) is already done, so there will only be a day or two to wait. As always I have to thank <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQI2e2hegCVnklh0bTO2VLg\">@lovesmelikebrandnewstarlight</a> for helping me with this chapter, it wouldn\u2019t be what it is without her, in fact it probably wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u00a0</p><p>Get your tissues ready!\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"http://all-the-love-harold.tumblr.com/post/174384574325/the-daily-anna-master-post\">Master Post\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"http://all-the-love-harold.tumblr.com/ask\">Thoughts/feelings (I need validation)\u00a0</a></p><p><br/></p><p>One of the Perks of\nDating Harry Styles is getting fast tracked through a busy airport. One of the\nperks of having End Stage Kidney Failure and dating Harry Styles is getting\nsuper fast tracked through a busy airport and getting on the plane last, just before\nit takes off. </p><p>Anna was tired. Her\nwhole body ached and keeping her eyes open long enough to get her seat belt done\nup was a struggle. She knew she didn\u2019t have long. \u00a0The last week of their trip had been more of a nightmare than a\ndream. She was on dialysis the whole time and everyone else was by her side,\nwhich was lovely and exhausting at the same time. Harry and Ronnie could barely\nlook at each other, Gemma and Gabby were competing to be Anna\u2019s emotional\nsupport. Debbie was a wreck and so was John and Anne, Anne was Anna\u2019s Saviour,\nshe knew exactly when Anna had had enough of everyone and when she needed them\nall back again. The doctors were still reluctant to let Anna go home, 24 hours\non a plane wasn\u2019t the best idea in her state, but she insisted so they did\neverything they could to make the trip as safe as possible. The airlines\nhowever, were not so accommodating. It took Harry days to find one that would\nallow her to fly at all and even then he had to talk them into it.</p><!-- more --><p>She was grateful\nshe\u2019d managed to get everything done so it lay secretly in a cloth bag, stored\nabove her head. No one else knew what was in there yet but they would\n\u00a0soon enough. She rested her head against her seat\nand allowed her eyes to close while the plane took off, trying to ignore the\npain in her sides, Harry, on the other hand, refused to sleep. This flight was\ndangerous, having Anna away from proper medical care at this point could mean a\ndisaster, so he was on the lookout for any signs that her body was shutting\ndown. His eyes stayed transfixed on her while she slept, almost like something\nout of Twilight, except that he would give anything to be sleeping too. Night\nquickly turned to day as they chased the sun around the globe and Anna\neventually woke up to everyone else snoring away, except Harry. </p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling\nAn?\u201d he asked softly the second he realised she was awake </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m alright H\u201d she\nsmiled, still half asleep. </p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he kissed her\nforehead \u201cShould we watch some F.R.I.E.N.D.S?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Anna shook her\nhead. She didn\u2019t want to concentrate that much, her body was sore, and even\nthough she was awake now she felt drowsy, like she could pass out again any\nminute. </p><p>\u201cYou could sing to me\nthough\u201d </p><p>\u201cSing?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d she whispered\n\u201cyour voice makes everything hurt less\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlright\u201d he nodded,\nhis accent suddenly thicker, maybe laced with worry. </p><p>\u201cIf I could\nfly\u2026.\u201dHarry began singing in a hushed tone </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re already flying\nStyles\u201d Anna whispered </p><p>\u201cAlright then\u201d he\nsighed \u201cyou tell me what to sing and I\u2019ll sing it\u201d </p><p>\u201cHmmm\u201d she hummed and\nthought for a \u00a0moment \u201cAnna\u201d </p><p>Harry chuckled\n\u201calright you little narcissist.\u201d he wrapped his arm around her shoulder and\nbrought her in closer so that her head to could rest on his chest and he\ncleared his throat and began to sing in a whispered tone. </p><p>\u201c<i>I don\u2019t want your\nsympathy, but you don\u2019t know what you do to me oh Anna</i>\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Anna sat up and\nlittle and turned to face Harry. \u201cYou can have a little bit of sympathy\u201d she\nsaid \u201cYour girlfriend is dying\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s face fell. He\nknew Anna was sick. The chances of her getting better at this point were pretty\nslim but hearing those words escape her mouth made it all the more \u00a0real\nand in that moment, his whole world felt like it was about to come tumbling\ndown. He was probably going to lose her and he didn\u2019t have a clue what the hell\nhe would do if that happened. \u00a0Tears filled his eyes and he couldn\u2019t find\nhis words but Anna didn\u2019t mind she simply held him close and savoured the\nmoment. </p><p>\u201cThere are worse\nthings than death, Styles\u201d she said after a few moments of silence. </p><p>\u201cLike grief\u201d he\nwhispered trying to choke back the tears. </p><p>\u201cNo, like never being\nbrave enough or lucky enough to fall in love. Everyone wants that and I\u2019ve had\nit. You\u2019re going to be alright H. I\u2019ll be nothing but a blip on your radar, but\nI hope it I hope it\u2019s a happy blip\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe happiest,\nElliot\u201d he smiled \u201cBut you\u2019re more than a blip, you always will be.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot getting tickets\nto that show of yours might just be the greatest thing that ever happened to\nme\u201d Anna admitted. This is something that she\u2019d been thinking about a lot\nlately, the smallest things add up to and become the best most life changing\nthings. If she got those tickets, Ronnie would never have even thought of\ngetting her a backstage pass, and she would have had the greatest night of her\nlife at that show but after that, everything would have gone back to normal,\ninstead, she got to see the show, meet Harry and fall in love. What else could\nshe ask for in her short little life?</p><p>\u201cMeeting that fake\nintern at my show was probably the best thing that has ever happened to me\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could think of a\nlot of pretty great things that have happened to you Styles\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just work\u201d he\nsaid \u201cThis is so much more\u201d </p><p>The flight drew on\nfor a few more hours and Anna dozed in and out of sleep, but Harry powered\nthrough his exhaustion and continued to keep an eye on Anna. Her skin was paler\nthan usual and her breaths slowed while she slept. But Harry knew that that was\nOk, it meant that her body was resting, willing itself to survive just a few\nmore hours. The others all slept too, until an hour before the plane was due to\nland in Dubai for a quick refuel. The stopover wasn\u2019t even long enough for them\nto get out, but it meant that there was only eight hours to go and that gave\nAnna some hope. Everyone had pretty much kept to themselves for the trip but\njust as the seatbelt lights disappeared again and the plane was safely in the\nair, Ronnie appeared behind Harry\u2019s seat and rested his hand on Harry\u2019s shoulder.\nConfused by the gesture, Harry turned around to look at him. </p><p>\u201cThis is all a bit\nridiculous don\u2019t you think?\u201d Ronnie said </p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d Harry\u2019s\ntemper was short</p><p>\u201cUs hating each\nother, look at her\u201d Ronnie gestured towards a sleeping Anna \u201cshe\u2019s dying and we\ncan\u2019t even look at each other just because we\u2019re jealous of the other\u201d </p><p>Harry took a deep\nbreath, he knew Ronnie was right but as far as he could see, he had nothing to\napologize for, Ronnie was in the wrong. </p><p>\u201cThis is a bit\nridiculous\u201d he agreed</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for the\nway I\u2019ve acted since you met Anna\u201d Ronnie said holding his hand out </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s alright\u201d\nHarry said shaking Ronnie\u2019s hand \u201csorry for being weird once I found out you\ntwo had a history\u201d </p><p>\u201cTruce\u201d Ronnie nodded\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t slept a second since we got on this plane, I\u2019ll sit with her for a\nwhile, you get some rest\u201d </p><p>Harry looked at Anna\nsleeping so peacefully and nodded and back at Ronnie. He didn\u2019t want to leave\nher, but his eyes were so heavy and he wasn\u2019t sure that he would be able to\nstay awake for the rest of the flight, and that could be worse than having\nronnie next to her. </p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d Harry\nnodded and stood up, allowing Ronnie to sit. </p><p>It \u00a0didn\u2019t take\nlong \u00a0however before things started to turn sour, but it wasn\u2019t Ronnie who\nnoticed, it was Gemma. </p><p>\u201cHer skin is awfully\nyellow\u201d she said as she walked past their seats on her way back from the\nbathroom. </p><p>That was a bad sign,\nit meant that not only were her kidneys failing, but all the toxins in her\nblood were causing her liver to fail too. </p><p>\u201cI thought that was\njust the lighting in here\u201d Ronnie admitted turning bright red with both\nembarrassment and worry. </p><p>\u201cWake her up\u201d Gemma\nsaid, crouching down next to Anna. </p><p>Ronnie did as he was\ntold and tried his best to wake her, but she wouldn\u2019t budge. </p><p>\u201cAnna Sweetie, I need\nyou to wake up now\u201d Gemma said softly, her voice shaking. The flight attendants\nstarted to catch on to what was happening and made their way over, just as Anna\nopened her eyes. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\nshe blinked </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking a\nlittle Jaundice love\u201d Gemma said \u201cI need you to stay awake now, the doctors\nsaid this might happen, and if it did then we should keep you alert\u201d </p><p>\u201cOk\u201d Anna nodded\nturning to around to find that Ronnie was sitting in Harry\u2019s spot \u201cRon, where\u2019s\nH? What\u2019s going on?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright An,\nhe\u2019s just over there, having a sleep\u201d </p><p>\u201cIs he alright?\u201d she\nasked, a little dazed and light headed. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine, just\nsleeping, don\u2019t worry about him\u201d Gemma said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got three hours left until\nwe land, and I need you to stay awake An, can you do that for me?\u201d </p><p>Anna nodded. </p><p>\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll come\nand sit with you in just a minute\u201d she said eyeing off Ronnie, confused as to\nwhy Harry and swapped with him in the first place, having missed the entire\nconversation that they\u2019d had. </p><p>\u201cIs she alright?\u201d the\nflight attendant asked Gemma. </p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a good\nsign\u201d she said in response \u201cbut there\u2019s nothing that can be done until we can\nget her to a hospital\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe can have an\nambulance on standby for when we land if it\u2019s urgent\u201d the attendant said </p><p>Gemma thought for a\nsecond and the nodded, looking back at Anna \u201cI think that\u2019s best\u201d </p><p>Nothing got better\nfrom there. Anna couldn\u2019t stay awake, she passed out only about fifteen minutes\nafter Gemma spoke to the flight attendants and after that it was just a waiting\ngame. They kept a close eye on her breathing and when it quickened they gave\nher oxygen, which helped, but it wasn\u2019t her lungs that were the problem now, it\nwas her heart. Her blood was now so full of potassium, that it was stopping her\nheart. Everyone was panicked now, there was nothing they could do to help her\nuntil they landed, so instead they hovered over her, watching her every\nmovement until the seatbelt light switched on and the disaster of a flight came\nto and end. </p><p>The wheels touched\ndown on the tarmac and the paramedics barged their way into the cabin to attend\nto Anna before anyone was allowed to move off the plane. They wheeled her off\nas quickly as they could with Harry and Debbie trailing closely behind. <br/>\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Mr Styles\u201d a flight attendant said, stepping in between Harry and\nthe paramedics \u201cthis is an international flight, I can\u2019t let you go without\ngoing through customs first\u201d </p><p>He could argue all he\nliked, but she wasn\u2019t going to budge on the idea, so he simply nodded and\nturned back around in defeat. </p><p>They were all ushered\noff the plane first and once again, the advantage of being Harry Styles took\nover and they were fast tracked through customs and left to wait at baggage\nclaim for the system to catch up with them. </p><p>\u201cYou go\u201d Gemma said\nto Harry and Anna\u2019s family \u201cMum and I will wait for the bags\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay and help\u201d\nRonnie said. He couldn\u2019t go, he didn\u2019t want to watch her die, he\u2019d been by her\nside since they were two years old, and watching her die felt like losing a\nwhole chunk of who he is. He couldn\u2019t go. Besides, this time there\u2019d be no Anna\nto make him smile despite their tears when Timmy died because she\u2019d be the one\nhe was losing.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d want you there\nmate\u201d Harry said </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\u201d he shook\nhis head \u201cI\u2019ll stay back\u201d </p><p>They didn\u2019t know\nwhere Anna had been taken, in the rush of it all, not a single one of them\nthought to ask the paramedics which of many hospitals in London they were\ntaking her to. Debbie, John and Gabby weren\u2019t a lot of help either, they didn\u2019t\nknow London very well and they were too worried to be thinking straight. </p><p>\u201cHer regular Hospital\nHarry, that\u2019s where they would have taken her\u201d Gabby said while they sat in the\ncab, unsure of what to tell the driver. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so far from\nhere\u201d he frowned \u201cThey would have taken her to the closest one\u201d </p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Debbie\nsaid to the driver \u201cWhat\u2019s the name of the closest hospital?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be\nHillingdon\u201d he said in thick London accent \u201cThat where we\u2019re headed?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ring them\nfirst\u201d Harry said with his phone already up to his ear. The tone rang for a few\nseconds for them all to hear but when Harry started to speak, they couldn&rsquo;t hear\nthe person at the other end. </p><p>\u201cHi, could you tell\nme if a patient has been taken to your hospital\u2026.in an ambulance, about 40\nminutes ago, \u2026.. Anna Elliot\u2026\u2026. Alright, thank you for your help.\u201d \u00a0He\nhung up the phone, telling the driver to head to the emergency department at\nthe Hillingdon hospital. The short drive felt like it took hours. \u00a0None of them spoke, all of them silent\nwondering if Anna was still breathing. When the cab eventually pulled up they\njumped out \u00a0as quickly as they could and rushed inside. </p><p>\u201cI was told Anna\nElliot was brought here by ambulance\u201d Harry said to the girl on the desk who\nwas typing away, uninterested in Harry\u2019s concern. </p><p>\u201cAre you her\nhusband?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo\u201d Harry said \u201cHer\nboyfriend\u201d </p><p>\u201cOnly immediate\nfamily, you\u2019ll have to wait out here\u201d </p><p>The girl lead the\nothers in,leaving Harry to wait on his own and all he could think about was\nAnna and Gabby, waiting in the waiting room while Timmy died. His heart ached,\nAnna was in there, in so much pain he wasn\u2019t there by her side like he\u2019d\npromised that he would be. In an effort to keep himself distracted he let Anne,\nGemma and Ronnie know where they were but the ticking clock was the only sound\nin the room and it was starting to drive him crazy. It was the middle of the\nday, people were in and out of the waiting room, going about their business,\nuntouched by the worry or nervousness that plagued Harry. </p><p>Hours passed and he\u2019d\nnot heard anything but at least now he had Anne, Gemma and Ronnie sitting with\nhim. It didn\u2019t make it any easier, but there was comfort in having his family\nthere with him. </p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go ask\nsomeone love?\u201d Anne asked after a while. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not immediate\nfamily\u201d Harry replied, staring straight at the white wall in front of him </p><p>\u201cThey might be able\nto give you some idea about what\u2019s going on, it\u2019s worth a shot\u201d </p><p>Harry\u2019s chest\ntightened as he stood, making his way over to the desk, which was now being\nmanned by a different nurse. </p><p>\u201cHi\u201d he said softly\n\u201cis it possible to get an update on a patient\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course\u201d she\nsmiled. Much kinder than the last \u201cwhat was their name\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnna Elliot\u201d </p><p>She typed the name\ninto the computer and grimaced at the screen. \u201cShe\u2019s been taken to the ICU, in\na critical condition. Are you family?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo\u201d he shook his\nhead </p><p>\u201cVisiting hours don\u2019t\nstart for another hour, so I can\u2019t let you in until then, but she\u2019s in room\n24c, and the ICU is on the fourth floor\u201d </p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d he nodded\nand turned back to sit with \u00a0Anne Gemma and Ronnie. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in the ICU, we\ncan see her in an hour\u201d he said softly. </p><p>\u201cDid she say how she\nwas doing?\u201d Gemma asked </p><p>\u201cCritical condition\u201d\nwas all that Harry could manage. He didn\u2019t really know what that meant, was she\nok? Was she still fighting her own body to stay alive? </p><p>Nobody said anything\nafter that, they were scared, but they were also jetlagged. Ronnie wanted to\nsleep. Gemma could barely keep her eyes open but Anne wide awake with Harry,\nholding his hand as they waited for that hour to pass. This was all too\nfamiliar to her and the last thing she wanted was for her son to feel the same\nway she did just over a year ago. She needed him to know that he wasn\u2019t alone\nin this. The clock ticked and tocked and eventually the hour was up and they\nwere able to go and see her. Harry\u2019s mouth was dry and he couldn\u2019t form a\ncoherent thought as they rode the elevator to the fourth floor. The lights up\nhere were bright and unnatural and it smelt like hand sanitiser. The\nuncomfortable silence was filled with the sounds of dozens of machines beeping\nall at once. \u00a0\u00a0Ronnie spotted Gabby, sitting outside a room, tears filling her\neyes. He didn\u2019t say anything to her, he simply held his hand out and engulfed\nher in a hug. As much as he wanted to comfort Gabby too, Harry had to know what\nwas going on with Anna, so he barged past them, into room 24c. </p><p>Anna was unconscious,\nconnected to dozens of machines that were buzzing and whirring around her. She\nlooked peaceful. </p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Harry\nasked, looking between John and Debbie who were sitting next to each other in\nthe corner of the room, just staring at Anna. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s&hellip;she\u2019s\u201d\nDebbie started, but she couldn\u2019t finish the sentence. </p><p>\u201cThis is it Harry\u201d\nJohn took over \u201cIt\u2019s just a waiting game now, could be hours, could be days\u201d </p><p>\u201cWill she wake?\u201d\nHarry wasn\u2019t sure if he wanted to know the answer to this, bit it was the only\nthing he could think to ask. </p><p>Both her parents\nshook their heads and Harry\u2019s eyes filled with tears again except this time he\ncouldn\u2019t stop them from falling. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll leave you two\nfor a while\u201d John said as he and Debbie left the room. </p><p>Harry pulled a chair\ncloser to Anna\u2019s bed and sat down beside her, grabbing onto her hand and\nkissing it. </p><p>\u201c I never told you\nthis An, and I don\u2019t even know if you can hear me now, but the night of the\nsecond show in London, just after we met, you asked what \u2018Anna\u2019 was about and I\nsaid a feeling. You\u2019re that feeling An, I wrote it about a feeling I\u2019d never\nhad before, then I saw you and I knew, and it helped that your name is Anna\u201d he\ngiggled a little through the tears. Talking to her felt pointless, but there\nwas so much that he never got to say. \u201cYou changed my life Anna Elliot, in the\nbest way possible, you came in and turned everything upside down and gave me\nthe happiest six months I\u2019ve ever had, and now everything\u2019s going to be right\nside up again and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do\u201d </p><p>Before Harry had the\nchance to say anything else a nurse came into the room, a sympathetic look on\nher face \u201cI\u2019m sorry sir, visiting hours are over\u201d </p>",

Her\nwhole body ached and keeping her eyes open long enough to get her seat belt done\nup was a struggle. She knew she didn\u2019t have long. \u00a0The last week of their trip had been more of a nightmare than a\ndream. She was on dialysis the whole time and everyone else was by her side,\nwhich was lovely and exhausting at the same time. Harry and Ronnie could barely\nlook at each other, Gemma and Gabby were competing to be Anna\u2019s emotional\nsupport.

The airlines\nhowever, were not so accommodating. It took Harry days to find one that would\nallow her to fly at all and even then he had to talk them into it.</p>[[MORE]]<p>She was grateful\nshe\u2019d managed to get everything done so it lay secretly in a cloth bag, stored\nabove her head. No one else knew what was in there yet but they would\n\u00a0soon enough. She rested her head against her seat\nand allowed her eyes to close while the plane took off, trying to ignore the\npain in her sides, Harry, on the other hand, refused to sleep. This flight was\ndangerous, having Anna away from proper medical care at this point could mean a\ndisaster, so he was on the lookout for any signs that her body was shutting\ndown. His eyes stayed transfixed on her while she slept, almost like something\nout of Twilight, except that he would give anything to be sleeping too. Night\nquickly turned to day as they chased the sun around the globe and Anna\neventually woke up to everyone else snoring away, except Harry. </p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling\nAn?\u201d he asked softly the second he realised she was awake </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m alright H\u201d she\nsmiled, still half asleep. </p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he kissed her\nforehead \u201cShould we watch some F.R.I.E.N.D.S?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Anna shook her\nhead. She didn\u2019t want to concentrate that much, her body was sore, and even\nthough she was awake now she felt drowsy, like she could pass out again any\nminute. </p><p>\u201cYou could sing to me\nthough\u201d </p><p>\u201cSing?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d she whispered\n\u201cyour voice makes everything hurt less\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlright\u201d he nodded,\nhis accent suddenly thicker, maybe laced with worry. </p><p>\u201cIf I could\nfly\u2026.\u201dHarry began singing in a hushed tone </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re already flying\nStyles\u201d Anna whispered </p><p>\u201cAlright then\u201d he\nsighed \u201cyou tell me what to sing and I\u2019ll sing it\u201d </p><p>\u201cHmmm\u201d she hummed and\nthought for a \u00a0moment \u201cAnna\u201d </p><p>Harry chuckled\n\u201calright you little narcissist.\u201d he wrapped his arm around her shoulder and\nbrought her in closer so that her head to could rest on his chest and he\ncleared his throat and began to sing in a whispered tone. </p><p>\u201c<i>I don\u2019t want your\nsympathy, but you don\u2019t know what you do to me oh Anna</i>\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Anna sat up and\nlittle and turned to face Harry. \u201cYou can have a little bit of sympathy\u201d she\nsaid \u201cYour girlfriend is dying\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s face fell. He\nknew Anna was sick. The chances of her getting better at this point were pretty\nslim but hearing those words escape her mouth made it all the more \u00a0real\nand in that moment, his whole world felt like it was about to come tumbling\ndown. He was probably going to lose her and he didn\u2019t have a clue what the hell\nhe would do if that happened. \u00a0Tears filled his eyes and he couldn\u2019t find\nhis words but Anna didn\u2019t mind she simply held him close and savoured the\nmoment. </p><p>\u201cThere are worse\nthings than death, Styles\u201d she said after a few moments of silence. </p><p>\u201cLike grief\u201d he\nwhispered trying to choke back the tears. </p><p>\u201cNo, like never being\nbrave enough or lucky enough to fall in love. Everyone wants that and I\u2019ve had\nit. You\u2019re going to be alright H. I\u2019ll be nothing but a blip on your radar, but\nI hope it I hope it\u2019s a happy blip\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe happiest,\nElliot\u201d he smiled \u201cBut you\u2019re more than a blip, you always will be.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot getting tickets\nto that show of yours might just be the greatest thing that ever happened to\nme\u201d Anna admitted. This is something that she\u2019d been thinking about a lot\nlately, the smallest things add up to and become the best most life changing\nthings. If she got those tickets, Ronnie would never have even thought of\ngetting her a backstage pass, and she would have had the greatest night of her\nlife at that show but after that, everything would have gone back to normal,\ninstead, she got to see the show, meet Harry and fall in love. What else could\nshe ask for in her short little life?</p><p>\u201cMeeting that fake\nintern at my show was probably the best thing that has ever happened to me\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could think of a\nlot of pretty great things that have happened to you Styles\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just work\u201d he\nsaid \u201cThis is so much more\u201d </p><p>The flight drew on\nfor a few more hours and Anna dozed in and out of sleep, but Harry powered\nthrough his exhaustion and continued to keep an eye on Anna. Her skin was paler\nthan usual and her breaths slowed while she slept. But Harry knew that that was\nOk, it meant that her body was resting, willing itself to survive just a few\nmore hours. The others all slept too, until an hour before the plane was due to\nland in Dubai for a quick refuel. The stopover wasn\u2019t even long enough for them\nto get out, but it meant that there was only eight hours to go and that gave\nAnna some hope. Everyone had pretty much kept to themselves for the trip but\njust as the seatbelt lights disappeared again and the plane was safely in the\nair, Ronnie appeared behind Harry\u2019s seat and rested his hand on Harry\u2019s shoulder.\nConfused by the gesture, Harry turned around to look at him. </p><p>\u201cThis is all a bit\nridiculous don\u2019t you think?\u201d Ronnie said </p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d Harry\u2019s\ntemper was short</p><p>\u201cUs hating each\nother, look at her\u201d Ronnie gestured towards a sleeping Anna \u201cshe\u2019s dying and we\ncan\u2019t even look at each other just because we\u2019re jealous of the other\u201d </p><p>Harry took a deep\nbreath, he knew Ronnie was right but as far as he could see, he had nothing to\napologize for, Ronnie was in the wrong. </p><p>\u201cThis is a bit\nridiculous\u201d he agreed</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for the\nway I\u2019ve acted since you met Anna\u201d Ronnie said holding his hand out </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s alright\u201d\nHarry said shaking Ronnie\u2019s hand \u201csorry for being weird once I found out you\ntwo had a history\u201d </p><p>\u201cTruce\u201d Ronnie nodded\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t slept a second since we got on this plane, I\u2019ll sit with her for a\nwhile, you get some rest\u201d </p><p>Harry looked at Anna\nsleeping so peacefully and nodded and back at Ronnie. He didn\u2019t want to leave\nher, but his eyes were so heavy and he wasn\u2019t sure that he would be able to\nstay awake for the rest of the flight, and that could be worse than having\nronnie next to her. </p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d Harry\nnodded and stood up, allowing Ronnie to sit. </p><p>It \u00a0didn\u2019t take\nlong \u00a0however before things started to turn sour, but it wasn\u2019t Ronnie who\nnoticed, it was Gemma. </p><p>\u201cHer skin is awfully\nyellow\u201d she said as she walked past their seats on her way back from the\nbathroom. </p><p>That was a bad sign,\nit meant that not only were her kidneys failing, but all the toxins in her\nblood were causing her liver to fail too. </p><p>\u201cI thought that was\njust the lighting in here\u201d Ronnie admitted turning bright red with both\nembarrassment and worry. </p><p>\u201cWake her up\u201d Gemma\nsaid, crouching down next to Anna. </p><p>Ronnie did as he was\ntold and tried his best to wake her, but she wouldn\u2019t budge. </p><p>\u201cAnna Sweetie, I need\nyou to wake up now\u201d Gemma said softly, her voice shaking. The flight attendants\nstarted to catch on to what was happening and made their way over, just as Anna\nopened her eyes. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\nshe blinked </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking a\nlittle Jaundice love\u201d Gemma said \u201cI need you to stay awake now, the doctors\nsaid this might happen, and if it did then we should keep you alert\u201d </p><p>\u201cOk\u201d Anna nodded\nturning to around to find that Ronnie was sitting in Harry\u2019s spot \u201cRon, where\u2019s\nH? What\u2019s going on?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright An,\nhe\u2019s just over there, having a sleep\u201d </p><p>\u201cIs he alright?\u201d she\nasked, a little dazed and light headed. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine, just\nsleeping, don\u2019t worry about him\u201d Gemma said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got three hours left until\nwe land, and I need you to stay awake An, can you do that for me?\u201d </p><p>Anna nodded. </p><p>\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll come\nand sit with you in just a minute\u201d she said eyeing off Ronnie, confused as to\nwhy Harry and swapped with him in the first place, having missed the entire\nconversation that they\u2019d had. </p><p>\u201cIs she alright?\u201d the\nflight attendant asked Gemma. </p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a good\nsign\u201d she said in response \u201cbut there\u2019s nothing that can be done until we can\nget her to a hospital\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe can have an\nambulance on standby for when we land if it\u2019s urgent\u201d the attendant said </p><p>Gemma thought for a\nsecond and the nodded, looking back at Anna \u201cI think that\u2019s best\u201d </p><p>Nothing got better\nfrom there. Anna couldn\u2019t stay awake, she passed out only about fifteen minutes\nafter Gemma spoke to the flight attendants and after that it was just a waiting\ngame. They kept a close eye on her breathing and when it quickened they gave\nher oxygen, which helped, but it wasn\u2019t her lungs that were the problem now, it\nwas her heart. Her blood was now so full of potassium, that it was stopping her\nheart. Everyone was panicked now, there was nothing they could do to help her\nuntil they landed, so instead they hovered over her, watching her every\nmovement until the seatbelt light switched on and the disaster of a flight came\nto and end. </p><p>The wheels touched\ndown on the tarmac and the paramedics barged their way into the cabin to attend\nto Anna before anyone was allowed to move off the plane. They wheeled her off\nas quickly as they could with Harry and Debbie trailing closely behind. <br>\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Mr Styles\u201d a flight attendant said, stepping in between Harry and\nthe paramedics \u201cthis is an international flight, I can\u2019t let you go without\ngoing through customs first\u201d </p><p>He could argue all he\nliked, but she wasn\u2019t going to budge on the idea, so he simply nodded and\nturned back around in defeat. </p><p>They were all ushered\noff the plane first and once again, the advantage of being Harry Styles took\nover and they were fast tracked through customs and left to wait at baggage\nclaim for the system to catch up with them. </p><p>\u201cYou go\u201d Gemma said\nto Harry and Anna\u2019s family \u201cMum and I will wait for the bags\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay and help\u201d\nRonnie said. He couldn\u2019t go, he didn\u2019t want to watch her die, he\u2019d been by her\nside since they were two years old, and watching her die felt like losing a\nwhole chunk of who he is. He couldn\u2019t go. Besides, this time there\u2019d be no Anna\nto make him smile despite their tears when Timmy died because she\u2019d be the one\nhe was losing.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d want you there\nmate\u201d Harry said </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\u201d he shook\nhis head \u201cI\u2019ll stay back\u201d </p><p>They didn\u2019t know\nwhere Anna had been taken, in the rush of it all, not a single one of them\nthought to ask the paramedics which of many hospitals in London they were\ntaking her to. Debbie, John and Gabby weren\u2019t a lot of help either, they didn\u2019t\nknow London very well and they were too worried to be thinking straight. </p><p>\u201cHer regular Hospital\nHarry, that\u2019s where they would have taken her\u201d Gabby said while they sat in the\ncab, unsure of what to tell the driver. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so far from\nhere\u201d he frowned \u201cThey would have taken her to the closest one\u201d </p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Debbie\nsaid to the driver \u201cWhat\u2019s the name of the closest hospital?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be\nHillingdon\u201d he said in thick London accent \u201cThat where we\u2019re headed?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ring them\nfirst\u201d Harry said with his phone already up to his ear. The tone rang for a few\nseconds for them all to hear but when Harry started to speak, they couldn\u2019t hear\nthe person at the other end. </p><p>\u201cHi, could you tell\nme if a patient has been taken to your hospital\u2026.in an ambulance, about 40\nminutes ago, \u2026.. Anna Elliot\u2026\u2026. Alright, thank you for your help.\u201d \u00a0He\nhung up the phone, telling the driver to head to the emergency department at\nthe Hillingdon hospital. The short drive felt like it took hours. \u00a0None of them spoke, all of them silent\nwondering if Anna was still breathing. When the cab eventually pulled up they\njumped out \u00a0as quickly as they could and rushed inside. </p><p>\u201cI was told Anna\nElliot was brought here by ambulance\u201d Harry said to the girl on the desk who\nwas typing away, uninterested in Harry\u2019s concern. </p><p>\u201cAre you her\nhusband?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo\u201d Harry said \u201cHer\nboyfriend\u201d </p><p>\u201cOnly immediate\nfamily, you\u2019ll have to wait out here\u201d </p><p>The girl lead the\nothers in,leaving Harry to wait on his own and all he could think about was\nAnna and Gabby, waiting in the waiting room while Timmy died. His heart ached,\nAnna was in there, in so much pain he wasn\u2019t there by her side like he\u2019d\npromised that he would be. In an effort to keep himself distracted he let Anne,\nGemma and Ronnie know where they were but the ticking clock was the only sound\nin the room and it was starting to drive him crazy. It was the middle of the\nday, people were in and out of the waiting room, going about their business,\nuntouched by the worry or nervousness that plagued Harry. </p><p>Hours passed and he\u2019d\nnot heard anything but at least now he had Anne, Gemma and Ronnie sitting with\nhim. It didn\u2019t make it any easier, but there was comfort in having his family\nthere with him. </p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go ask\nsomeone love?\u201d Anne asked after a while. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not immediate\nfamily\u201d Harry replied, staring straight at the white wall in front of him </p><p>\u201cThey might be able\nto give you some idea about what\u2019s going on, it\u2019s worth a shot\u201d </p><p>Harry\u2019s chest\ntightened as he stood, making his way over to the desk, which was now being\nmanned by a different nurse. </p><p>\u201cHi\u201d he said softly\n\u201cis it possible to get an update on a patient\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course\u201d she\nsmiled. Much kinder than the last \u201cwhat was their name\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnna Elliot\u201d </p><p>She typed the name\ninto the computer and grimaced at the screen. \u201cShe\u2019s been taken to the ICU, in\na critical condition. Are you family?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo\u201d he shook his\nhead </p><p>\u201cVisiting hours don\u2019t\nstart for another hour, so I can\u2019t let you in until then, but she\u2019s in room\n24c, and the ICU is on the fourth floor\u201d </p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d he nodded\nand turned back to sit with \u00a0Anne Gemma and Ronnie. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in the ICU, we\ncan see her in an hour\u201d he said softly. </p><p>\u201cDid she say how she\nwas doing?\u201d Gemma asked </p><p>\u201cCritical condition\u201d\nwas all that Harry could manage. He didn\u2019t really know what that meant, was she\nok? Was she still fighting her own body to stay alive? </p><p>Nobody said anything\nafter that, they were scared, but they were also jetlagged. Ronnie wanted to\nsleep. Gemma could barely keep her eyes open but Anne wide awake with Harry,\nholding his hand as they waited for that hour to pass. This was all too\nfamiliar to her and the last thing she wanted was for her son to feel the same\nway she did just over a year ago. She needed him to know that he wasn\u2019t alone\nin this. The clock ticked and tocked and eventually the hour was up and they\nwere able to go and see her. Harry\u2019s mouth was dry and he couldn\u2019t form a\ncoherent thought as they rode the elevator to the fourth floor. The lights up\nhere were bright and unnatural and it smelt like hand sanitiser. The\nuncomfortable silence was filled with the sounds of dozens of machines beeping\nall at once. \u00a0\u00a0Ronnie spotted Gabby, sitting outside a room, tears filling her\neyes. He didn\u2019t say anything to her, he simply held his hand out and engulfed\nher in a hug. As much as he wanted to comfort Gabby too, Harry had to know what\nwas going on with Anna, so he barged past them, into room 24c. </p><p>Anna was unconscious,\nconnected to dozens of machines that were buzzing and whirring around her. She\nlooked peaceful. </p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Harry\nasked, looking between John and Debbie who were sitting next to each other in\nthe corner of the room, just staring at Anna. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s\u2026she\u2019s\u201d\nDebbie started, but she couldn\u2019t finish the sentence. </p><p>\u201cThis is it Harry\u201d\nJohn took over \u201cIt\u2019s just a waiting game now, could be hours, could be days\u201d </p><p>\u201cWill she wake?\u201d\nHarry wasn\u2019t sure if he wanted to know the answer to this, bit it was the only\nthing he could think to ask. </p><p>Both her parents\nshook their heads and Harry\u2019s eyes filled with tears again except this time he\ncouldn\u2019t stop them from falling. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll leave you two\nfor a while\u201d John said as he and Debbie left the room. </p><p>Harry pulled a chair\ncloser to Anna\u2019s bed and sat down beside her, grabbing onto her hand and\nkissing it. </p><p>\u201c I never told you\nthis An, and I don\u2019t even know if you can hear me now, but the night of the\nsecond show in London, just after we met, you asked what \u2018Anna\u2019 was about and I\nsaid a feeling. You\u2019re that feeling An, I wrote it about a feeling I\u2019d never\nhad before, then I saw you and I knew, and it helped that your name is Anna\u201d he\ngiggled a little through the tears. Talking to her felt pointless, but there\nwas so much that he never got to say. \u201cYou changed my life Anna Elliot, in the\nbest way possible, you came in and turned everything upside down and gave me\nthe happiest six months I\u2019ve ever had, and now everything\u2019s going to be right\nside up again and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do\u201d </p><p>Before Harry had the\nchance to say anything else a nurse came into the room, a sympathetic look on\nher face \u201cI\u2019m sorry sir, visiting hours are over\u201d </p></p>",

One of the\nperks of having End Stage Kidney Failure and dating Harry Styles is getting\nsuper fast tracked through a busy airport and getting on the plane last, just before\nit takes off. </p><p>Anna was tired. Her\nwhole body ached and keeping her eyes open long enough to get her seat belt done\nup was a struggle. She knew she didn\u2019t have long. \u00a0The last week of their trip had been more of a nightmare than a\ndream. She was on dialysis the whole time and everyone else was by her side,\nwhich was lovely and exhausting at the same time. Harry and Ronnie could barely\nlook at each other, Gemma and Gabby were competing to be Anna\u2019s emotional\nsupport. Debbie was a wreck and so was John and Anne, Anne was Anna\u2019s Saviour,\nshe knew exactly when Anna had had enough of everyone and when she needed them\nall back again. The doctors were still reluctant to let Anna go home, 24 hours\non a plane wasn\u2019t the best idea in her state, but she insisted so they did\neverything they could to make the trip as safe as possible. The airlines\nhowever, were not so accommodating. It took Harry days to find one that would\nallow her to fly at all and even then he had to talk them into it.</p>[[MORE]]<p>She was grateful\nshe\u2019d managed to get everything done so it lay secretly in a cloth bag, stored\nabove her head. No one else knew what was in there yet but they would\n\u00a0soon enough. She rested her head against her seat\nand allowed her eyes to close while the plane took off, trying to ignore the\npain in her sides, Harry, on the other hand, refused to sleep. This flight was\ndangerous, having Anna away from proper medical care at this point could mean a\ndisaster, so he was on the lookout for any signs that her body was shutting\ndown. His eyes stayed transfixed on her while she slept, almost like something\nout of Twilight, except that he would give anything to be sleeping too. Night\nquickly turned to day as they chased the sun around the globe and Anna\neventually woke up to everyone else snoring away, except Harry. </p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling\nAn?\u201d he asked softly the second he realised she was awake </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m alright H\u201d she\nsmiled, still half asleep. </p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he kissed her\nforehead \u201cShould we watch some F.R.I.E.N.D.S?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Anna shook her\nhead. She didn\u2019t want to concentrate that much, her body was sore, and even\nthough she was awake now she felt drowsy, like she could pass out again any\nminute. </p><p>\u201cYou could sing to me\nthough\u201d </p><p>\u201cSing?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d she whispered\n\u201cyour voice makes everything hurt less\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlright\u201d he nodded,\nhis accent suddenly thicker, maybe laced with worry. </p><p>\u201cIf I could\nfly\u2026.\u201dHarry began singing in a hushed tone </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re already flying\nStyles\u201d Anna whispered </p><p>\u201cAlright then\u201d he\nsighed \u201cyou tell me what to sing and I\u2019ll sing it\u201d </p><p>\u201cHmmm\u201d she hummed and\nthought for a \u00a0moment \u201cAnna\u201d </p><p>Harry chuckled\n\u201calright you little narcissist.\u201d he wrapped his arm around her shoulder and\nbrought her in closer so that her head to could rest on his chest and he\ncleared his throat and began to sing in a whispered tone. </p><p>\u201c<i>I don\u2019t want your\nsympathy, but you don\u2019t know what you do to me oh Anna</i>\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Anna sat up and\nlittle and turned to face Harry. \u201cYou can have a little bit of sympathy\u201d she\nsaid \u201cYour girlfriend is dying\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s face fell. He\nknew Anna was sick. The chances of her getting better at this point were pretty\nslim but hearing those words escape her mouth made it all the more \u00a0real\nand in that moment, his whole world felt like it was about to come tumbling\ndown. He was probably going to lose her and he didn\u2019t have a clue what the hell\nhe would do if that happened. \u00a0Tears filled his eyes and he couldn\u2019t find\nhis words but Anna didn\u2019t mind she simply held him close and savoured the\nmoment. </p><p>\u201cThere are worse\nthings than death, Styles\u201d she said after a few moments of silence. </p><p>\u201cLike grief\u201d he\nwhispered trying to choke back the tears. </p><p>\u201cNo, like never being\nbrave enough or lucky enough to fall in love. Everyone wants that and I\u2019ve had\nit. You\u2019re going to be alright H. I\u2019ll be nothing but a blip on your radar, but\nI hope it I hope it\u2019s a happy blip\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe happiest,\nElliot\u201d he smiled \u201cBut you\u2019re more than a blip, you always will be.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot getting tickets\nto that show of yours might just be the greatest thing that ever happened to\nme\u201d Anna admitted. This is something that she\u2019d been thinking about a lot\nlately, the smallest things add up to and become the best most life changing\nthings. If she got those tickets, Ronnie would never have even thought of\ngetting her a backstage pass, and she would have had the greatest night of her\nlife at that show but after that, everything would have gone back to normal,\ninstead, she got to see the show, meet Harry and fall in love. What else could\nshe ask for in her short little life?</p><p>\u201cMeeting that fake\nintern at my show was probably the best thing that has ever happened to me\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could think of a\nlot of pretty great things that have happened to you Styles\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just work\u201d he\nsaid \u201cThis is so much more\u201d </p><p>The flight drew on\nfor a few more hours and Anna dozed in and out of sleep, but Harry powered\nthrough his exhaustion and continued to keep an eye on Anna. Her skin was paler\nthan usual and her breaths slowed while she slept. But Harry knew that that was\nOk, it meant that her body was resting, willing itself to survive just a few\nmore hours. The others all slept too, until an hour before the plane was due to\nland in Dubai for a quick refuel. The stopover wasn\u2019t even long enough for them\nto get out, but it meant that there was only eight hours to go and that gave\nAnna some hope. Everyone had pretty much kept to themselves for the trip but\njust as the seatbelt lights disappeared again and the plane was safely in the\nair, Ronnie appeared behind Harry\u2019s seat and rested his hand on Harry\u2019s shoulder.\nConfused by the gesture, Harry turned around to look at him. </p><p>\u201cThis is all a bit\nridiculous don\u2019t you think?\u201d Ronnie said </p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d Harry\u2019s\ntemper was short</p><p>\u201cUs hating each\nother, look at her\u201d Ronnie gestured towards a sleeping Anna \u201cshe\u2019s dying and we\ncan\u2019t even look at each other just because we\u2019re jealous of the other\u201d </p><p>Harry took a deep\nbreath, he knew Ronnie was right but as far as he could see, he had nothing to\napologize for, Ronnie was in the wrong. </p><p>\u201cThis is a bit\nridiculous\u201d he agreed</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for the\nway I\u2019ve acted since you met Anna\u201d Ronnie said holding his hand out </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s alright\u201d\nHarry said shaking Ronnie\u2019s hand \u201csorry for being weird once I found out you\ntwo had a history\u201d </p><p>\u201cTruce\u201d Ronnie nodded\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t slept a second since we got on this plane, I\u2019ll sit with her for a\nwhile, you get some rest\u201d </p><p>Harry looked at Anna\nsleeping so peacefully and nodded and back at Ronnie. He didn\u2019t want to leave\nher, but his eyes were so heavy and he wasn\u2019t sure that he would be able to\nstay awake for the rest of the flight, and that could be worse than having\nronnie next to her. </p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d Harry\nnodded and stood up, allowing Ronnie to sit. </p><p>It \u00a0didn\u2019t take\nlong \u00a0however before things started to turn sour, but it wasn\u2019t Ronnie who\nnoticed, it was Gemma. </p><p>\u201cHer skin is awfully\nyellow\u201d she said as she walked past their seats on her way back from the\nbathroom. </p><p>That was a bad sign,\nit meant that not only were her kidneys failing, but all the toxins in her\nblood were causing her liver to fail too. </p><p>\u201cI thought that was\njust the lighting in here\u201d Ronnie admitted turning bright red with both\nembarrassment and worry. </p><p>\u201cWake her up\u201d Gemma\nsaid, crouching down next to Anna. </p><p>Ronnie did as he was\ntold and tried his best to wake her, but she wouldn\u2019t budge. </p><p>\u201cAnna Sweetie, I need\nyou to wake up now\u201d Gemma said softly, her voice shaking. The flight attendants\nstarted to catch on to what was happening and made their way over, just as Anna\nopened her eyes. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\nshe blinked </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking a\nlittle Jaundice love\u201d Gemma said \u201cI need you to stay awake now, the doctors\nsaid this might happen, and if it did then we should keep you alert\u201d </p><p>\u201cOk\u201d Anna nodded\nturning to around to find that Ronnie was sitting in Harry\u2019s spot \u201cRon, where\u2019s\nH? What\u2019s going on?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright An,\nhe\u2019s just over there, having a sleep\u201d </p><p>\u201cIs he alright?\u201d she\nasked, a little dazed and light headed. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine, just\nsleeping, don\u2019t worry about him\u201d Gemma said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got three hours left until\nwe land, and I need you to stay awake An, can you do that for me?\u201d </p><p>Anna nodded. </p><p>\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll come\nand sit with you in just a minute\u201d she said eyeing off Ronnie, confused as to\nwhy Harry and swapped with him in the first place, having missed the entire\nconversation that they\u2019d had. </p><p>\u201cIs she alright?\u201d the\nflight attendant asked Gemma. </p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a good\nsign\u201d she said in response \u201cbut there\u2019s nothing that can be done until we can\nget her to a hospital\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe can have an\nambulance on standby for when we land if it\u2019s urgent\u201d the attendant said </p><p>Gemma thought for a\nsecond and the nodded, looking back at Anna \u201cI think that\u2019s best\u201d </p><p>Nothing got better\nfrom there. Anna couldn\u2019t stay awake, she passed out only about fifteen minutes\nafter Gemma spoke to the flight attendants and after that it was just a waiting\ngame. They kept a close eye on her breathing and when it quickened they gave\nher oxygen, which helped, but it wasn\u2019t her lungs that were the problem now, it\nwas her heart. Her blood was now so full of potassium, that it was stopping her\nheart. Everyone was panicked now, there was nothing they could do to help her\nuntil they landed, so instead they hovered over her, watching her every\nmovement until the seatbelt light switched on and the disaster of a flight came\nto and end. </p><p>The wheels touched\ndown on the tarmac and the paramedics barged their way into the cabin to attend\nto Anna before anyone was allowed to move off the plane. They wheeled her off\nas quickly as they could with Harry and Debbie trailing closely behind. <br>\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Mr Styles\u201d a flight attendant said, stepping in between Harry and\nthe paramedics \u201cthis is an international flight, I can\u2019t let you go without\ngoing through customs first\u201d </p><p>He could argue all he\nliked, but she wasn\u2019t going to budge on the idea, so he simply nodded and\nturned back around in defeat. </p><p>They were all ushered\noff the plane first and once again, the advantage of being Harry Styles took\nover and they were fast tracked through customs and left to wait at baggage\nclaim for the system to catch up with them. </p><p>\u201cYou go\u201d Gemma said\nto Harry and Anna\u2019s family \u201cMum and I will wait for the bags\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay and help\u201d\nRonnie said. He couldn\u2019t go, he didn\u2019t want to watch her die, he\u2019d been by her\nside since they were two years old, and watching her die felt like losing a\nwhole chunk of who he is. He couldn\u2019t go. Besides, this time there\u2019d be no Anna\nto make him smile despite their tears when Timmy died because she\u2019d be the one\nhe was losing.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d want you there\nmate\u201d Harry said </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\u201d he shook\nhis head \u201cI\u2019ll stay back\u201d </p><p>They didn\u2019t know\nwhere Anna had been taken, in the rush of it all, not a single one of them\nthought to ask the paramedics which of many hospitals in London they were\ntaking her to. Debbie, John and Gabby weren\u2019t a lot of help either, they didn\u2019t\nknow London very well and they were too worried to be thinking straight. </p><p>\u201cHer regular Hospital\nHarry, that\u2019s where they would have taken her\u201d Gabby said while they sat in the\ncab, unsure of what to tell the driver. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so far from\nhere\u201d he frowned \u201cThey would have taken her to the closest one\u201d </p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Debbie\nsaid to the driver \u201cWhat\u2019s the name of the closest hospital?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be\nHillingdon\u201d he said in thick London accent \u201cThat where we\u2019re headed?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ring them\nfirst\u201d Harry said with his phone already up to his ear. The tone rang for a few\nseconds for them all to hear but when Harry started to speak, they couldn\u2019t hear\nthe person at the other end. </p><p>\u201cHi, could you tell\nme if a patient has been taken to your hospital\u2026.in an ambulance, about 40\nminutes ago, \u2026.. Anna Elliot\u2026\u2026. Alright, thank you for your help.\u201d \u00a0He\nhung up the phone, telling the driver to head to the emergency department at\nthe Hillingdon hospital. The short drive felt like it took hours. \u00a0None of them spoke, all of them silent\nwondering if Anna was still breathing. When the cab eventually pulled up they\njumped out \u00a0as quickly as they could and rushed inside. </p><p>\u201cI was told Anna\nElliot was brought here by ambulance\u201d Harry said to the girl on the desk who\nwas typing away, uninterested in Harry\u2019s concern. </p><p>\u201cAre you her\nhusband?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo\u201d Harry said \u201cHer\nboyfriend\u201d </p><p>\u201cOnly immediate\nfamily, you\u2019ll have to wait out here\u201d </p><p>The girl lead the\nothers in,leaving Harry to wait on his own and all he could think about was\nAnna and Gabby, waiting in the waiting room while Timmy died. His heart ached,\nAnna was in there, in so much pain he wasn\u2019t there by her side like he\u2019d\npromised that he would be. In an effort to keep himself distracted he let Anne,\nGemma and Ronnie know where they were but the ticking clock was the only sound\nin the room and it was starting to drive him crazy. It was the middle of the\nday, people were in and out of the waiting room, going about their business,\nuntouched by the worry or nervousness that plagued Harry. </p><p>Hours passed and he\u2019d\nnot heard anything but at least now he had Anne, Gemma and Ronnie sitting with\nhim. It didn\u2019t make it any easier, but there was comfort in having his family\nthere with him. </p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go ask\nsomeone love?\u201d Anne asked after a while. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not immediate\nfamily\u201d Harry replied, staring straight at the white wall in front of him </p><p>\u201cThey might be able\nto give you some idea about what\u2019s going on, it\u2019s worth a shot\u201d </p><p>Harry\u2019s chest\ntightened as he stood, making his way over to the desk, which was now being\nmanned by a different nurse. </p><p>\u201cHi\u201d he said softly\n\u201cis it possible to get an update on a patient\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course\u201d she\nsmiled.

One of the\nperks of having End Stage Kidney Failure and dating Harry Styles is getting\nsuper fast tracked through a busy airport and getting on the plane last, just before\nit takes off. </p><p>Anna was tired. Her\nwhole body ached and keeping her eyes open long enough to get her seat belt done\nup was a struggle. She knew she didn&rsquo;t have long. &nbsp;The last week of their trip had been more of a nightmare than a\ndream. She was on dialysis the whole time and everyone else was by her side,\nwhich was lovely and exhausting at the same time. Harry and Ronnie could barely\nlook at each other, Gemma and Gabby were competing to be Anna&rsquo;s emotional\nsupport. Debbie was a wreck and so was John and Anne, Anne was Anna&rsquo;s Saviour,\nshe knew exactly when Anna had had enough of everyone and when she needed them\nall back again. The doctors were still reluctant to let Anna go home, 24 hours\non a plane wasn&rsquo;t the best idea in her state, but she insisted so they did\neverything they could to make the trip as safe as possible. The airlines\nhowever, were not so accommodating. It took Harry days to find one that would\nallow her to fly at all and even then he had to talk them into it.</p><p>She was grateful\nshe&rsquo;d managed to get everything done so it lay secretly in a cloth bag, stored\nabove her head. No one else knew what was in there yet but they would\n&nbsp;soon enough. She rested her head against her seat\nand allowed her eyes to close while the plane took off, trying to ignore the\npain in her sides, Harry, on the other hand, refused to sleep. This flight was\ndangerous, having Anna away from proper medical care at this point could mean a\ndisaster, so he was on the lookout for any signs that her body was shutting\ndown. His eyes stayed transfixed on her while she slept, almost like something\nout of Twilight, except that he would give anything to be sleeping too. Night\nquickly turned to day as they chased the sun around the globe and Anna\neventually woke up to everyone else snoring away, except Harry. </p><p>&ldquo;How are you feeling\nAn?&rdquo; he asked softly the second he realised she was awake </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m alright H&rdquo; she\nsmiled, still half asleep. </p><p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he kissed her\nforehead &ldquo;Should we watch some F.R.I.E.N.D.S?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Anna shook her\nhead. She didn&rsquo;t want to concentrate that much, her body was sore, and even\nthough she was awake now she felt drowsy, like she could pass out again any\nminute. </p><p>&ldquo;You could sing to me\nthough&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sing?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&rdquo; she whispered\n&ldquo;your voice makes everything hurt less&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Alright&rdquo; he nodded,\nhis accent suddenly thicker, maybe laced with worry. </p><p>&ldquo;If I could\nfly&hellip;.&rdquo;Harry began singing in a hushed tone </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re already flying\nStyles&rdquo; Anna whispered </p><p>&ldquo;Alright then&rdquo; he\nsighed &ldquo;you tell me what to sing and I&rsquo;ll sing it&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hmmm&rdquo; she hummed and\nthought for a &nbsp;moment &ldquo;Anna&rdquo; </p><p>Harry chuckled\n&ldquo;alright you little narcissist.&rdquo; he wrapped his arm around her shoulder and\nbrought her in closer so that her head to could rest on his chest and he\ncleared his throat and began to sing in a whispered tone. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>I don&rsquo;t want your\nsympathy, but you don&rsquo;t know what you do to me oh Anna</i>&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>Anna sat up and\nlittle and turned to face Harry. &ldquo;You can have a little bit of sympathy&rdquo; she\nsaid &ldquo;Your girlfriend is dying&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s face fell. He\nknew Anna was sick. The chances of her getting better at this point were pretty\nslim but hearing those words escape her mouth made it all the more &nbsp;real\nand in that moment, his whole world felt like it was about to come tumbling\ndown. He was probably going to lose her and he didn&rsquo;t have a clue what the hell\nhe would do if that happened. &nbsp;Tears filled his eyes and he couldn&rsquo;t find\nhis words but Anna didn&rsquo;t mind she simply held him close and savoured the\nmoment. </p><p>&ldquo;There are worse\nthings than death, Styles&rdquo; she said after a few moments of silence. </p><p>&ldquo;Like grief&rdquo; he\nwhispered trying to choke back the tears. </p><p>&ldquo;No, like never being\nbrave enough or lucky enough to fall in love. Everyone wants that and I&rsquo;ve had\nit. You&rsquo;re going to be alright H. I&rsquo;ll be nothing but a blip on your radar, but\nI hope it I hope it&rsquo;s a happy blip&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;The happiest,\nElliot&rdquo; he smiled &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re more than a blip, you always will be.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Not getting tickets\nto that show of yours might just be the greatest thing that ever happened to\nme&rdquo; Anna admitted. This is something that she&rsquo;d been thinking about a lot\nlately, the smallest things add up to and become the best most life changing\nthings. If she got those tickets, Ronnie would never have even thought of\ngetting her a backstage pass, and she would have had the greatest night of her\nlife at that show but after that, everything would have gone back to normal,\ninstead, she got to see the show, meet Harry and fall in love. What else could\nshe ask for in her short little life?</p><p>&ldquo;Meeting that fake\nintern at my show was probably the best thing that has ever happened to me&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I could think of a\nlot of pretty great things that have happened to you Styles&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just work&rdquo; he\nsaid &ldquo;This is so much more&rdquo; </p><p>The flight drew on\nfor a few more hours and Anna dozed in and out of sleep, but Harry powered\nthrough his exhaustion and continued to keep an eye on Anna. Her skin was paler\nthan usual and her breaths slowed while she slept. But Harry knew that that was\nOk, it meant that her body was resting, willing itself to survive just a few\nmore hours. The others all slept too, until an hour before the plane was due to\nland in Dubai for a quick refuel. The stopover wasn&rsquo;t even long enough for them\nto get out, but it meant that there was only eight hours to go and that gave\nAnna some hope. Everyone had pretty much kept to themselves for the trip but\njust as the seatbelt lights disappeared again and the plane was safely in the\nair, Ronnie appeared behind Harry&rsquo;s seat and rested his hand on Harry&rsquo;s shoulder.\nConfused by the gesture, Harry turned around to look at him. </p><p>&ldquo;This is all a bit\nridiculous don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; Ronnie said </p><p>&ldquo;What is?&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s\ntemper was short</p><p>&ldquo;Us hating each\nother, look at her&rdquo; Ronnie gestured towards a sleeping Anna &ldquo;she&rsquo;s dying and we\ncan&rsquo;t even look at each other just because we&rsquo;re jealous of the other&rdquo; </p><p>Harry took a deep\nbreath, he knew Ronnie was right but as far as he could see, he had nothing to\napologize for, Ronnie was in the wrong. </p><p>&ldquo;This is a bit\nridiculous&rdquo; he agreed</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for the\nway I&rsquo;ve acted since you met Anna&rdquo; Ronnie said holding his hand out </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s alright&rdquo;\nHarry said shaking Ronnie&rsquo;s hand &ldquo;sorry for being weird once I found out you\ntwo had a history&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Truce&rdquo; Ronnie nodded\n&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t slept a second since we got on this plane, I&rsquo;ll sit with her for a\nwhile, you get some rest&rdquo; </p><p>Harry looked at Anna\nsleeping so peacefully and nodded and back at Ronnie. He didn&rsquo;t want to leave\nher, but his eyes were so heavy and he wasn&rsquo;t sure that he would be able to\nstay awake for the rest of the flight, and that could be worse than having\nronnie next to her. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; Harry\nnodded and stood up, allowing Ronnie to sit. </p><p>It &nbsp;didn&rsquo;t take\nlong &nbsp;however before things started to turn sour, but it wasn&rsquo;t Ronnie who\nnoticed, it was Gemma. </p><p>&ldquo;Her skin is awfully\nyellow&rdquo; she said as she walked past their seats on her way back from the\nbathroom. </p><p>That was a bad sign,\nit meant that not only were her kidneys failing, but all the toxins in her\nblood were causing her liver to fail too. </p><p>&ldquo;I thought that was\njust the lighting in here&rdquo; Ronnie admitted turning bright red with both\nembarrassment and worry. </p><p>&ldquo;Wake her up&rdquo; Gemma\nsaid, crouching down next to Anna. </p><p>Ronnie did as he was\ntold and tried his best to wake her, but she wouldn&rsquo;t budge. </p><p>&ldquo;Anna Sweetie, I need\nyou to wake up now&rdquo; Gemma said softly, her voice shaking. The flight attendants\nstarted to catch on to what was happening and made their way over, just as Anna\nopened her eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;\nshe blinked </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking a\nlittle Jaundice love&rdquo; Gemma said &ldquo;I need you to stay awake now, the doctors\nsaid this might happen, and if it did then we should keep you alert&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Ok&rdquo; Anna nodded\nturning to around to find that Ronnie was sitting in Harry&rsquo;s spot &ldquo;Ron, where&rsquo;s\nH? What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright An,\nhe&rsquo;s just over there, having a sleep&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Is he alright?&rdquo; she\nasked, a little dazed and light headed. </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s fine, just\nsleeping, don&rsquo;t worry about him&rdquo; Gemma said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got three hours left until\nwe land, and I need you to stay awake An, can you do that for me?&rdquo; </p><p>Anna nodded. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright. I&rsquo;ll come\nand sit with you in just a minute&rdquo; she said eyeing off Ronnie, confused as to\nwhy Harry and swapped with him in the first place, having missed the entire\nconversation that they&rsquo;d had. </p><p>&ldquo;Is she alright?&rdquo; the\nflight attendant asked Gemma. </p><p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a good\nsign&rdquo; she said in response &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s nothing that can be done until we can\nget her to a hospital&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We can have an\nambulance on standby for when we land if it&rsquo;s urgent&rdquo; the attendant said </p><p>Gemma thought for a\nsecond and the nodded, looking back at Anna &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s best&rdquo; </p><p>Nothing got better\nfrom there. Anna couldn&rsquo;t stay awake, she passed out only about fifteen minutes\nafter Gemma spoke to the flight attendants and after that it was just a waiting\ngame. They kept a close eye on her breathing and when it quickened they gave\nher oxygen, which helped, but it wasn&rsquo;t her lungs that were the problem now, it\nwas her heart. Her blood was now so full of potassium, that it was stopping her\nheart. Everyone was panicked now, there was nothing they could do to help her\nuntil they landed, so instead they hovered over her, watching her every\nmovement until the seatbelt light switched on and the disaster of a flight came\nto and end. </p><p>The wheels touched\ndown on the tarmac and the paramedics barged their way into the cabin to attend\nto Anna before anyone was allowed to move off the plane. They wheeled her off\nas quickly as they could with Harry and Debbie trailing closely behind. <br />\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry Mr Styles&rdquo; a flight attendant said, stepping in between Harry and\nthe paramedics &ldquo;this is an international flight, I can&rsquo;t let you go without\ngoing through customs first&rdquo; </p><p>He could argue all he\nliked, but she wasn&rsquo;t going to budge on the idea, so he simply nodded and\nturned back around in defeat. </p><p>They were all ushered\noff the plane first and once again, the advantage of being Harry Styles took\nover and they were fast tracked through customs and left to wait at baggage\nclaim for the system to catch up with them. </p><p>&ldquo;You go&rdquo; Gemma said\nto Harry and Anna&rsquo;s family &ldquo;Mum and I will wait for the bags&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay and help&rdquo;\nRonnie said. He couldn&rsquo;t go, he didn&rsquo;t want to watch her die, he&rsquo;d been by her\nside since they were two years old, and watching her die felt like losing a\nwhole chunk of who he is. He couldn&rsquo;t go. Besides, this time there&rsquo;d be no Anna\nto make him smile despite their tears when Timmy died because she&rsquo;d be the one\nhe was losing.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d want you there\nmate&rdquo; Harry said </p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&rdquo; he shook\nhis head &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay back&rdquo; </p><p>They didn&rsquo;t know\nwhere Anna had been taken, in the rush of it all, not a single one of them\nthought to ask the paramedics which of many hospitals in London they were\ntaking her to. Debbie, John and Gabby weren&rsquo;t a lot of help either, they didn&rsquo;t\nknow London very well and they were too worried to be thinking straight. </p><p>&ldquo;Her regular Hospital\nHarry, that&rsquo;s where they would have taken her&rdquo; Gabby said while they sat in the\ncab, unsure of what to tell the driver. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so far from\nhere&rdquo; he frowned &ldquo;They would have taken her to the closest one&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo; Debbie\nsaid to the driver &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the name of the closest hospital?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;d be\nHillingdon&rdquo; he said in thick London accent &ldquo;That where we&rsquo;re headed?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ring them\nfirst&rdquo; Harry said with his phone already up to his ear. The tone rang for a few\nseconds for them all to hear but when Harry started to speak, they couldn&rsquo;t hear\nthe person at the other end. </p><p>&ldquo;Hi, could you tell\nme if a patient has been taken to your hospital&hellip;.in an ambulance, about 40\nminutes ago, &hellip;.. Anna Elliot&hellip;&hellip;. Alright, thank you for your help.&rdquo; &nbsp;He\nhung up the phone, telling the driver to head to the emergency department at\nthe Hillingdon hospital. The short drive felt like it took hours. &nbsp;None of them spoke, all of them silent\nwondering if Anna was still breathing. When the cab eventually pulled up they\njumped out &nbsp;as quickly as they could and rushed inside. </p><p>&ldquo;I was told Anna\nElliot was brought here by ambulance&rdquo; Harry said to the girl on the desk who\nwas typing away, uninterested in Harry&rsquo;s concern. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you her\nhusband?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No&rdquo; Harry said &ldquo;Her\nboyfriend&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Only immediate\nfamily, you&rsquo;ll have to wait out here&rdquo; </p><p>The girl lead the\nothers in,leaving Harry to wait on his own and all he could think about was\nAnna and Gabby, waiting in the waiting room while Timmy died. His heart ached,\nAnna was in there, in so much pain he wasn&rsquo;t there by her side like he&rsquo;d\npromised that he would be. In an effort to keep himself distracted he let Anne,\nGemma and Ronnie know where they were but the ticking clock was the only sound\nin the room and it was starting to drive him crazy. It was the middle of the\nday, people were in and out of the waiting room, going about their business,\nuntouched by the worry or nervousness that plagued Harry. </p><p>Hours passed and he&rsquo;d\nnot heard anything but at least now he had Anne, Gemma and Ronnie sitting with\nhim. It didn&rsquo;t make it any easier, but there was comfort in having his family\nthere with him. </p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go ask\nsomeone love?&rdquo; Anne asked after a while. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not immediate\nfamily&rdquo; Harry replied, staring straight at the white wall in front of him </p><p>&ldquo;They might be able\nto give you some idea about what&rsquo;s going on, it&rsquo;s worth a shot&rdquo; </p><p>Harry&rsquo;s chest\ntightened as he stood, making his way over to the desk, which was now being\nmanned by a different nurse. </p><p>&ldquo;Hi&rdquo; he said softly\n&ldquo;is it possible to get an update on a patient&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Of course&rdquo; she\nsmiled. Much kinder than the last &ldquo;what was their name&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Anna Elliot&rdquo; </p><p>She typed the name\ninto the computer and grimaced at the screen. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been taken to the ICU, in\na critical condition. Are you family?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No&rdquo; he shook his\nhead </p><p>&ldquo;Visiting hours don&rsquo;t\nstart for another hour, so I can&rsquo;t let you in until then, but she&rsquo;s in room\n24c, and the ICU is on the fourth floor&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; he nodded\nand turned back to sit with &nbsp;Anne Gemma and Ronnie. </p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in the ICU, we\ncan see her in an hour&rdquo; he said softly. </p><p>&ldquo;Did she say how she\nwas doing?&rdquo; Gemma asked </p><p>&ldquo;Critical condition&rdquo;\nwas all that Harry could manage. He didn&rsquo;t really know what that meant, was she\nok? Was she still fighting her own body to stay alive? </p><p>Nobody said anything\nafter that, they were scared, but they were also jetlagged. Ronnie wanted to\nsleep. Gemma could barely keep her eyes open but Anne wide awake with Harry,\nholding his hand as they waited for that hour to pass. This was all too\nfamiliar to her and the last thing she wanted was for her son to feel the same\nway she did just over a year ago. She needed him to know that he wasn&rsquo;t alone\nin this. The clock ticked and tocked and eventually the hour was up and they\nwere able to go and see her. Harry&rsquo;s mouth was dry and he couldn&rsquo;t form a\ncoherent thought as they rode the elevator to the fourth floor. The lights up\nhere were bright and unnatural and it smelt like hand sanitiser. The\nuncomfortable silence was filled with the sounds of dozens of machines beeping\nall at once. &nbsp;&nbsp;Ronnie spotted Gabby, sitting outside a room, tears filling her\neyes. He didn&rsquo;t say anything to her, he simply held his hand out and engulfed\nher in a hug. As much as he wanted to comfort Gabby too, Harry had to know what\nwas going on with Anna, so he barged past them, into room 24c. </p><p>Anna was unconscious,\nconnected to dozens of machines that were buzzing and whirring around her.

Debbie was a wreck and so was John and Anne, Anne was Anna&rsquo;s Saviour,\nshe knew exactly when Anna had had enough of everyone and when she needed them\nall back again. The doctors were still reluctant to let Anna go home, 24 hours\non a plane wasn&rsquo;t the best idea in her state, but she insisted so they did\neverything they could to make the trip as safe as possible. The airlines\nhowever, were not so accommodating. It took Harry days to find one that would\nallow her to fly at all and even then he had to talk them into it.</p>\n</p>",

You did the same though. Still, there was an undeniable love between the two of you. You sat in your hotel room in Harry\u2019s jacket from last night. You were sure he\u2019s looking for it. You stole it when he took it off last night in the dressing room. It was a bit sweaty, but you smelled his scent in it, so you slept in it. Now, in the morning you decided to leave it on and preparing for the next few days. You made a shopping list and there were plans for the day off too. Mostly work, since Harry decided to be an executive producer and also he had long phone calls with Alessandro Michele or someone else from Gucci. They didn\u2019t tell you yet, but they were up to something big.</p><p>\u201cUhm.. I was thinking if you knew where I put my jacket last night\u201d Harry said in the phone. </p><p>\u201cYou put it on the couch in your dressing room\u201d you answered. </p><p>\u201cDo you think I left it there?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, I stole it\u201d you smiled.</p><p>\u201cHey! You still haven\u2019t given me back the Palomo jacket you took\u201d he pouted.</p><p>\u201cYou have other ones and you don\u2019t even wear them. Stop whining!\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cOkay. See you at the car\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSee ya!\u201d</p><p>Next phone call was Lottie\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cSo I looked through the photos from the tour and something\u2019s weird\u201d she started.</p><p>\u201cHello maybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Hi, am I interrupting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll go on. So, the picture from Dallas. Kacey and Harry\u201d you groaned. You got enough of hearing that two names together. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, I just hear Kacey and Harry from everywhere now. Like they were some power couple.\u2019</p><p>\u201cWell, they seem to be good friends and you know that the media loves putting Harry together with any girl that is around him\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know it, I\u2019m his personal assistant and I read every article about him. But I am his bloody girlfriend and I know people don\u2019t know that, but I\u2019m sick of living in the background\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, love, if I knew it makes you upset, I don\u2019t bring it up\u201d you sat down on your bed finally and almost started crying.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m overreacting, but I don\u2019t know how long I can go like this\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, love\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat did you wanna say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually that Kacey looks weird on that picture, like she was a wax figure\u201d she said and you chuckled a bit.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019re gonna say they look like a perfect couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, you\u2019re paranoid. Second, I wouldn\u2019t tell you that even if I thought that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow get out of your room and kiss your wonderful boyfriend. I\u2019ll go and make a tea to watch a romantic movie to fall asleep on\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for calling\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime, darling\u201d you hung up and went to see Harry. He was still in his room. You walked in and he was lying on the bed still. He was reading a book. </p><p>\u201cGood morning, love\u201d he said with a husky voice. You didn\u2019t say anything but kissed him.</p><p>\u201cMmm, I missed that\u201d he said with eyes brighter than the sun.</p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s have breakfast\u201d </p><p>After breakfast everyone left to Hershey. The trip was filled with work mostly. Everyone was occupied. Harry was working hard with Jeff, but he promised that the evening is yours. You didn\u2019t mind, because you were with Sarah and Clare that afternoon, rehearsing your surprise for the karaoke party. You even chose the right outfits for it and ordered it. You made a little choreography for the song you wanted to perform. It was the kind of fun you missed. You were with Harry almost 24/7, and you missed being silly with girls. Time flew and it was 7 already. The girls left your room a half an hour ago and Harry promised to come at 7. You were sitting on your bed, waiting for him. It was 7.15 when you got up and started walking around. A sigh left your mouth when he rushed in. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I was on the phone\u201d he apologized while he walked in with your favourite sweets in his hands. He gave you a kiss and then sat down with you on the bed. You agreed on watching While You Were Sleeping. You cuddled in bed until you fell asleep. You couldn\u2019t tell if he stayed the night, because he was out by the morning. </p><p>As you arrived early in Hershey Park Stadium, you saw that Harry is already there. He was playing baseball with some of the crew members. This venue was open-air so it was a bit different from the others. But you loved it, the sun was shining and it brought you a better mood that you were in yesterday. Harry waved to you as he saw you. You waved back. You met Jeff as you went backstage. </p><p>\u201cGood morning\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGood morning\u201d </p><p>\u201cDid Harry call you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I saw him playing outside\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean Lambert\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, no. Haven\u2019t talked with him in the last few days\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s gonna call you now\u201d he smiled. </p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d it was more of a question. You didn\u2019t know what this is about, but you sat down next to Jeff and jumped into work immediately. You were working together this day. After a half an hour Harry walked in. </p><p>\u201cHeey!\u201d you heard him. He walked behind you and kissed the top of your head. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you working at?\u201d He sat down beside you.</p><p>\u201cRight now? Making appointments for a check up. Everyone needs to be tested again\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cSo I have to stop with drugs, right?\u201d he joked. He leaned very close to your ear. You felt his breath on your skin. \u201cBut you\u2019re my only drug\u201d he whispered. You blushed a bit. </p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t ever stop with that\u201d you whispered back. He smirked. He left you two to finish work. You smiled and thought maybe you could work it through and it felt good. A little later you saw Harry widely smiling and laughing a bit far from you. You smiled but then you saw that he\u2019s with Kacey again. You realized that you haven\u2019t seen that kind of smile on his face recently when he was with you. It made your heart break. Jeff noticed that your mood turned upside down in one second. </p><p>\u201cy/n, you can tell me what\u2019s going on. I won\u2019t tell Harry if you don\u2019t want me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know Jeff, I don\u2019t feel what I used to feel. I\u2019m insecure all the time\u201d you said. </p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s because of the messages, but it was just a psycho\u2019s game. Talk to him. You know him. You know you can talk to him\u201d he advised. </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, Jeff. That\u2019s the problem. I can\u2019t even talk to him like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my opinion it would be better if you\u2019d try. Or write it down, but let him know how you feel\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cOkay\u201d you sighed. \u00a0As time passed and you finished the paperwork, you walked through the place and watched as the crew members work hard on preparing the venue for the show. Sarah waved to you and you walked to her. She sat on one of the seats. </p><p>\u201cHey, girl!\u201d she said. </p><p>\u201cHey! What\u2019s up?\u201d you sat down next to her. </p><p>\u201cI loved yesterday afternoon. I think the karaoke party will be so much fun\u201d she said. </p><p>\u201cOh, yeah! Was it your idea?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, then I told Clare that we should do it together. She loved it. And we loved your idea about the matching outfits\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks\u201d you smiled. </p><p>\u201cYou got used to be in matching clothes with Harry, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d you chuckled. </p><p>\u201cLook, it\u2019s none of my business, but you two don\u2019t seem to be madly in love. Is it because you don\u2019t want to expose your relationship, or you distanced?\u201d she asked. You sighed and looked down at your hands. </p><p>\u201cI\u2026 we\u2026 I want\u2026 I think we distanced a bit. There was something going on recently\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it something to do with Mike? I heard that he was taken by the police and I haven\u2019t seen him since\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhm, yeah. But it\u2019s confidential, so I can\u2019t tell you details. But it ruined us a bit and we still haven\u2019t talk it through. I mean, I thought we\u2019ll get closer by the time and stuff but it seems we\u2019re just drifting away from each other\u201d you admitted. </p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want that. You are a great pair. I already planned double dates with you two and Mitch\u201d she said. You chuckled a bit.</p><p>\u201cThat would be nice, if we\u2019re still together after tour\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want t hear anything like that. You\u2019re gonna solve it, I\u2019m sure\u201d she said. You wanted to react but you saw the sound engineer wave to you to come down. You went together and soundcheck started. </p><p>Harry smiled at you several times and you tried your best to smile back. It was hard with Kacey next to you. At some point you were doubting Harry smiles at you or Kacey. As soundcheck finished you got dressed in the most beautiful skirt you\u2019ve ever seen. It was the same colour as Harry\u2019s suit tonight. As you walked out of your dressing room you saw Harry by the stage but still in the back. He stood there like a dream. Kacey was on stage, doing the pre-show and he watched it. You saw Helene capture the moment, you smiled. You wanted to go and hug him casually but you knew that anyone could see you in a venue like this. You were sure even some fans saw Harry standing there. When he saw you watching him, he waved you to go there. You stood next to him. </p><p>\u201cYou know that I love you, right?\u201d he asked still looking at the show. You looked at him and he looked at you. You couldn\u2019t answer and he saw that in your eyes. </p><p>\u201cI love you, Harry\u201d you said and you both turned your eyes back to the stage as Kacey finished her last song. Harry walked away to get ready and you just stayed there in your beautiful luxury clothes in a sold out venue watching your boyfriend, Harry Styles and you thought you should be happy. But you felt empty. You almost started crying, but you felt a hand on your back. You turned right and Louis stood there smiling. You smiled back. You were so emotional at that point that you hugged him tight.</p><p>\u201cOi, girl\u201d he chuckled. He stayed with you the whole show and you two danced together to the songs. And when you cried during Sign of the Times, Just a Little Bit of Your Heart, Sweet Creature, If I Could Fly he gave you a tissue every time.\u00a0After Harry did the whale he ran off stage and stopped by you. He was hyped and smiled widely.</p><p>\u201cDid you enjoy it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cA lot\u201d you smiled and gave a kiss on his cheek. You three went back to the hotel together. When you were in the car, Louis spoke up.</p><p>\u201cGuys, I wanted to tell you that I gotta go back to the UK tomorrow. I\u2019ll try to come back as often as I can, but I got a great opportunity\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI was offered a seat in the X-Factor judges\u201d he smiled. </p><p>\u201cOh my!\u201d you were surprised.</p><p>\u201cWow! That\u2019s great. With Simon?\u201d Harry asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s funny, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hilarious and amazing\u201d Harry added. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna miss you both\u201d Lou said. </p><p>You were quite sad that he leaves because you became good friends since you first met him. And now in this weird situation with Harry you wanted Lou to stay, but it was amazing that he\u2019s gonna be a judge in the X-Factor. You packed up everything and traveled overnight again to Philadelphia. You slept in Harry\u2019s arms in the car, but it felt weird this time. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"324\" data-orig-width=\"443\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"1dlarryluv:HsykshiEUgQ1KjH6w1rKJA:ZMx5Vo2Yx6gI2\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8935f532ca59a4cbfc61c676212165fc/tumblr_paeliqu2EQ1ts2grho1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"324\" data-orig-width=\"443\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"310\" data-orig-width=\"268\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"thestylesgifs:-kghtBulJV3esyD9oVfVFQ:Z3JQ8h2YwDVr4\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/47a1d0dbf43e02782922c0c07851d847/tumblr_padrxhbwxg1vtwrluo1_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"310\" data-orig-width=\"268\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"347\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"2tiedships2:5b9wIMfEjc3QTUxfrqYH4A:ZvJGXl2YvAQZY\" style=\"\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/24cf66b5162404534dc3f1df761fbefa/tumblr_paclinnyHS1u8ct77o1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"347\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure>",

You did the same though. Still, there was an undeniable love between the two of you. You sat in your hotel room in Harry\u2019s jacket from last night. You were sure he\u2019s looking for it. You stole it when he took it off last night in the dressing room. It was a bit sweaty, but you smelled his scent in it, so you slept in it. Now, in the morning you decided to leave it on and preparing for the next few days. You made a shopping list and there were plans for the day off too. Mostly work, since Harry decided to be an executive producer and also he had long phone calls with Alessandro Michele or someone else from Gucci. They didn\u2019t tell you yet, but they were up to something big.</p><p>\u201cUhm.. I was thinking if you knew where I put my jacket last night\u201d Harry said in the phone. </p><p>\u201cYou put it on the couch in your dressing room\u201d you answered. </p><p>\u201cDo you think I left it there?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, I stole it\u201d you smiled.</p><p>\u201cHey! You still haven\u2019t given me back the Palomo jacket you took\u201d he pouted.</p><p>\u201cYou have other ones and you don\u2019t even wear them. Stop whining!\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cOkay. See you at the car\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSee ya!\u201d</p><p>Next phone call was Lottie\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cSo I looked through the photos from the tour and something\u2019s weird\u201d she started.</p><p>\u201cHello maybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Hi, am I interrupting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll go on. So, the picture from Dallas. Kacey and Harry\u201d you groaned. You got enough of hearing that two names together. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, I just hear Kacey and Harry from everywhere now. Like they were some power couple.\u2019</p><p>\u201cWell, they seem to be good friends and you know that the media loves putting Harry together with any girl that is around him\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know it, I\u2019m his personal assistant and I read every article about him. But I am his bloody girlfriend and I know people don\u2019t know that, but I\u2019m sick of living in the background\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, love, if I knew it makes you upset, I don\u2019t bring it up\u201d you sat down on your bed finally and almost started crying.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m overreacting, but I don\u2019t know how long I can go like this\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, love\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat did you wanna say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually that Kacey looks weird on that picture, like she was a wax figure\u201d she said and you chuckled a bit.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019re gonna say they look like a perfect couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, you\u2019re paranoid. Second, I wouldn\u2019t tell you that even if I thought that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow get out of your room and kiss your wonderful boyfriend. I\u2019ll go and make a tea to watch a romantic movie to fall asleep on\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for calling\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime, darling\u201d you hung up and went to see Harry. He was still in his room. You walked in and he was lying on the bed still. He was reading a book. </p><p>\u201cGood morning, love\u201d he said with a husky voice. You didn\u2019t say anything but kissed him.</p><p>\u201cMmm, I missed that\u201d he said with eyes brighter than the sun.</p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s have breakfast\u201d </p><p>After breakfast everyone left to Hershey. The trip was filled with work mostly. Everyone was occupied. Harry was working hard with Jeff, but he promised that the evening is yours. You didn\u2019t mind, because you were with Sarah and Clare that afternoon, rehearsing your surprise for the karaoke party. You even chose the right outfits for it and ordered it. You made a little choreography for the song you wanted to perform. It was the kind of fun you missed. You were with Harry almost 24/7, and you missed being silly with girls. Time flew and it was 7 already. The girls left your room a half an hour ago and Harry promised to come at 7. You were sitting on your bed, waiting for him. It was 7.15 when you got up and started walking around. A sigh left your mouth when he rushed in. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I was on the phone\u201d he apologized while he walked in with your favourite sweets in his hands. He gave you a kiss and then sat down with you on the bed. You agreed on watching While You Were Sleeping. You cuddled in bed until you fell asleep. You couldn\u2019t tell if he stayed the night, because he was out by the morning. </p><p>As you arrived early in Hershey Park Stadium, you saw that Harry is already there. He was playing baseball with some of the crew members. This venue was open-air so it was a bit different from the others. But you loved it, the sun was shining and it brought you a better mood that you were in yesterday. Harry waved to you as he saw you. You waved back. You met Jeff as you went backstage. </p><p>\u201cGood morning\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGood morning\u201d </p><p>\u201cDid Harry call you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I saw him playing outside\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean Lambert\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, no. Haven\u2019t talked with him in the last few days\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s gonna call you now\u201d he smiled. </p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d it was more of a question. You didn\u2019t know what this is about, but you sat down next to Jeff and jumped into work immediately. You were working together this day. After a half an hour Harry walked in. </p><p>\u201cHeey!\u201d you heard him. He walked behind you and kissed the top of your head. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you working at?\u201d He sat down beside you.</p><p>\u201cRight now? Making appointments for a check up. Everyone needs to be tested again\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cSo I have to stop with drugs, right?\u201d he joked. He leaned very close to your ear. You felt his breath on your skin. \u201cBut you\u2019re my only drug\u201d he whispered. You blushed a bit. </p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t ever stop with that\u201d you whispered back. He smirked. He left you two to finish work. You smiled and thought maybe you could work it through and it felt good. A little later you saw Harry widely smiling and laughing a bit far from you. You smiled but then you saw that he\u2019s with Kacey again. You realized that you haven\u2019t seen that kind of smile on his face recently when he was with you. It made your heart break.

You did the same though. Still, there was an undeniable love between the two of you. You sat in your hotel room in Harry\u2019s jacket from last night. You were sure he\u2019s looking for it. You stole it when he took it off last night in the dressing room. It was a bit sweaty, but you smelled his scent in it, so you slept in it. Now, in the morning you decided to leave it on and preparing for the next few days. You made a shopping list and there were plans for the day off too. Mostly work, since Harry decided to be an executive producer and also he had long phone calls with Alessandro Michele or someone else from Gucci. They didn\u2019t tell you yet, but they were up to something big.</p><p>\u201cUhm.. I was thinking if you knew where I put my jacket last night\u201d Harry said in the phone. </p><p>\u201cYou put it on the couch in your dressing room\u201d you answered. </p><p>\u201cDo you think I left it there?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, I stole it\u201d you smiled.</p><p>\u201cHey! You still haven\u2019t given me back the Palomo jacket you took\u201d he pouted.</p><p>\u201cYou have other ones and you don\u2019t even wear them. Stop whining!\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cOkay. See you at the car\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSee ya!\u201d</p><p>Next phone call was Lottie\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cSo I looked through the photos from the tour and something\u2019s weird\u201d she started.</p><p>\u201cHello maybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Hi, am I interrupting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll go on. So, the picture from Dallas. Kacey and Harry\u201d you groaned. You got enough of hearing that two names together. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, I just hear Kacey and Harry from everywhere now. Like they were some power couple.\u2019</p><p>\u201cWell, they seem to be good friends and you know that the media loves putting Harry together with any girl that is around him\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know it, I\u2019m his personal assistant and I read every article about him. But I am his bloody girlfriend and I know people don\u2019t know that, but I\u2019m sick of living in the background\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, love, if I knew it makes you upset, I don\u2019t bring it up\u201d you sat down on your bed finally and almost started crying.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m overreacting, but I don\u2019t know how long I can go like this\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, love\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat did you wanna say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually that Kacey looks weird on that picture, like she was a wax figure\u201d she said and you chuckled a bit.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019re gonna say they look like a perfect couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, you\u2019re paranoid. Second, I wouldn\u2019t tell you that even if I thought that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow get out of your room and kiss your wonderful boyfriend. I\u2019ll go and make a tea to watch a romantic movie to fall asleep on\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for calling\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime, darling\u201d you hung up and went to see Harry. He was still in his room. You walked in and he was lying on the bed still. He was reading a book. </p><p>\u201cGood morning, love\u201d he said with a husky voice. You didn\u2019t say anything but kissed him.</p><p>\u201cMmm, I missed that\u201d he said with eyes brighter than the sun.</p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s have breakfast\u201d </p><p>After breakfast everyone left to Hershey. The trip was filled with work mostly. Everyone was occupied. Harry was working hard with Jeff, but he promised that the evening is yours. You didn\u2019t mind, because you were with Sarah and Clare that afternoon, rehearsing your surprise for the karaoke party. You even chose the right outfits for it and ordered it. You made a little choreography for the song you wanted to perform. It was the kind of fun you missed. You were with Harry almost 24/7, and you missed being silly with girls. Time flew and it was 7 already. The girls left your room a half an hour ago and Harry promised to come at 7. You were sitting on your bed, waiting for him. It was 7.15 when you got up and started walking around. A sigh left your mouth when he rushed in. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I was on the phone\u201d he apologized while he walked in with your favourite sweets in his hands. He gave you a kiss and then sat down with you on the bed. You agreed on watching While You Were Sleeping. You cuddled in bed until you fell asleep. You couldn\u2019t tell if he stayed the night, because he was out by the morning. </p><p>As you arrived early in Hershey Park Stadium, you saw that Harry is already there. He was playing baseball with some of the crew members. This venue was open-air so it was a bit different from the others. But you loved it, the sun was shining and it brought you a better mood that you were in yesterday. Harry waved to you as he saw you. You waved back. You met Jeff as you went backstage. </p><p>\u201cGood morning\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGood morning\u201d </p><p>\u201cDid Harry call you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I saw him playing outside\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean Lambert\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, no. Haven\u2019t talked with him in the last few days\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s gonna call you now\u201d he smiled. </p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d it was more of a question. You didn\u2019t know what this is about, but you sat down next to Jeff and jumped into work immediately. You were working together this day. After a half an hour Harry walked in. </p><p>\u201cHeey!\u201d you heard him. He walked behind you and kissed the top of your head. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you working at?\u201d He sat down beside you.</p><p>\u201cRight now? Making appointments for a check up. Everyone needs to be tested again\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cSo I have to stop with drugs, right?\u201d he joked. He leaned very close to your ear. You felt his breath on your skin. \u201cBut you\u2019re my only drug\u201d he whispered. You blushed a bit. </p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t ever stop with that\u201d you whispered back. He smirked. He left you two to finish work. You smiled and thought maybe you could work it through and it felt good. A little later you saw Harry widely smiling and laughing a bit far from you. You smiled but then you saw that he\u2019s with Kacey again. You realized that you haven\u2019t seen that kind of smile on his face recently when he was with you. It made your heart break. Jeff noticed that your mood turned upside down in one second. </p><p>\u201cy/n, you can tell me what\u2019s going on. I won\u2019t tell Harry if you don\u2019t want me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know Jeff, I don\u2019t feel what I used to feel. I\u2019m insecure all the time\u201d you said. </p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s because of the messages, but it was just a psycho\u2019s game. Talk to him. You know him. You know you can talk to him\u201d he advised. </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, Jeff. That\u2019s the problem. I can\u2019t even talk to him like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my opinion it would be better if you\u2019d try. Or write it down, but let him know how you feel\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cOkay\u201d you sighed. \u00a0As time passed and you finished the paperwork, you walked through the place and watched as the crew members work hard on preparing the venue for the show. Sarah waved to you and you walked to her. She sat on one of the seats. </p><p>\u201cHey, girl!\u201d she said. </p><p>\u201cHey! What\u2019s up?\u201d you sat down next to her. </p><p>\u201cI loved yesterday afternoon. I think the karaoke party will be so much fun\u201d she said. </p><p>\u201cOh, yeah! Was it your idea?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, then I told Clare that we should do it together. She loved it. And we loved your idea about the matching outfits\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks\u201d you smiled. </p><p>\u201cYou got used to be in matching clothes with Harry, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d you chuckled. </p><p>\u201cLook, it\u2019s none of my business, but you two don\u2019t seem to be madly in love. Is it because you don\u2019t want to expose your relationship, or you distanced?\u201d she asked. You sighed and looked down at your hands. </p><p>\u201cI\u2026 we\u2026 I want\u2026 I think we distanced a bit. There was something going on recently\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it something to do with Mike? I heard that he was taken by the police and I haven\u2019t seen him since\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhm, yeah. But it\u2019s confidential, so I can\u2019t tell you details. But it ruined us a bit and we still haven\u2019t talk it through. I mean, I thought we\u2019ll get closer by the time and stuff but it seems we\u2019re just drifting away from each other\u201d you admitted. </p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want that. You are a great pair. I already planned double dates with you two and Mitch\u201d she said. You chuckled a bit.</p><p>\u201cThat would be nice, if we\u2019re still together after tour\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want t hear anything like that. You\u2019re gonna solve it, I\u2019m sure\u201d she said. You wanted to react but you saw the sound engineer wave to you to come down. You went together and soundcheck started. </p><p>Harry smiled at you several times and you tried your best to smile back. It was hard with Kacey next to you. At some point you were doubting Harry smiles at you or Kacey. As soundcheck finished you got dressed in the most beautiful skirt you\u2019ve ever seen. It was the same colour as Harry\u2019s suit tonight. As you walked out of your dressing room you saw Harry by the stage but still in the back. He stood there like a dream. Kacey was on stage, doing the pre-show and he watched it. You saw Helene capture the moment, you smiled. You wanted to go and hug him casually but you knew that anyone could see you in a venue like this. You were sure even some fans saw Harry standing there. When he saw you watching him, he waved you to go there. You stood next to him. </p><p>\u201cYou know that I love you, right?\u201d he asked still looking at the show. You looked at him and he looked at you. You couldn\u2019t answer and he saw that in your eyes. </p><p>\u201cI love you, Harry\u201d you said and you both turned your eyes back to the stage as Kacey finished her last song. Harry walked away to get ready and you just stayed there in your beautiful luxury clothes in a sold out venue watching your boyfriend, Harry Styles and you thought you should be happy. But you felt empty. You almost started crying, but you felt a hand on your back. You turned right and Louis stood there smiling. You smiled back. You were so emotional at that point that you hugged him tight.</p><p>\u201cOi, girl\u201d he chuckled. He stayed with you the whole show and you two danced together to the songs. And when you cried during Sign of the Times, Just a Little Bit of Your Heart, Sweet Creature, If I Could Fly he gave you a tissue every time.\u00a0After Harry did the whale he ran off stage and stopped by you. He was hyped and smiled widely.</p><p>\u201cDid you enjoy it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cA lot\u201d you smiled and gave a kiss on his cheek. You three went back to the hotel together. When you were in the car, Louis spoke up.</p><p>\u201cGuys, I wanted to tell you that I gotta go back to the UK tomorrow. I\u2019ll try to come back as often as I can, but I got a great opportunity\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI was offered a seat in the X-Factor judges\u201d he smiled. </p><p>\u201cOh my!\u201d you were surprised.</p><p>\u201cWow! That\u2019s great. With Simon?\u201d Harry asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s funny, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hilarious and amazing\u201d Harry added. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna miss you both\u201d Lou said. </p><p>You were quite sad that he leaves because you became good friends since you first met him. And now in this weird situation with Harry you wanted Lou to stay, but it was amazing that he\u2019s gonna be a judge in the X-Factor. You packed up everything and traveled overnight again to Philadelphia. You slept in Harry\u2019s arms in the car, but it felt weird this time. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"324\" data-orig-width=\"443\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"1dlarryluv:HsykshiEUgQ1KjH6w1rKJA:ZMx5Vo2Yx6gI2\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8935f532ca59a4cbfc61c676212165fc/tumblr_paeliqu2EQ1ts2grho1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"324\" data-orig-width=\"443\"></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"310\" data-orig-width=\"268\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"thestylesgifs:-kghtBulJV3esyD9oVfVFQ:Z3JQ8h2YwDVr4\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/47a1d0dbf43e02782922c0c07851d847/tumblr_padrxhbwxg1vtwrluo1_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"310\" data-orig-width=\"268\"></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"347\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"2tiedships2:5b9wIMfEjc3QTUxfrqYH4A:ZvJGXl2YvAQZY\" style=\"\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/24cf66b5162404534dc3f1df761fbefa/tumblr_paclinnyHS1u8ct77o1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"347\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure></p>",

Was it your idea?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, then I told Clare that we should do it together. She loved it. And we loved your idea about the matching outfits&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks&rdquo; you smiled. </p><p>&ldquo;You got used to be in matching clothes with Harry, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&rdquo; you chuckled. </p><p>&ldquo;Look, it&rsquo;s none of my business, but you two don&rsquo;t seem to be madly in love. Is it because you don&rsquo;t want to expose your relationship, or you distanced?&rdquo; she asked. You sighed and looked down at your hands. </p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip; we&hellip; I want&hellip; I think we distanced a bit. There was something going on recently&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is it something to do with Mike? I heard that he was taken by the police and I haven&rsquo;t seen him since&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uhm, yeah. But it&rsquo;s confidential, so I can&rsquo;t tell you details. But it ruined us a bit and we still haven&rsquo;t talk it through. I mean, I thought we&rsquo;ll get closer by the time and stuff but it seems we&rsquo;re just drifting away from each other&rdquo; you admitted. </p><p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t want that. You are a great pair. I already planned double dates with you two and Mitch&rdquo; she said. You chuckled a bit.</p><p>&ldquo;That would be nice, if we&rsquo;re still together after tour&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want t hear anything like that. You&rsquo;re gonna solve it, I&rsquo;m sure&rdquo; she said. You wanted to react but you saw the sound engineer wave to you to come down. You went together and soundcheck started. </p><p>Harry smiled at you several times and you tried your best to smile back. It was hard with Kacey next to you. At some point you were doubting Harry smiles at you or Kacey. As soundcheck finished you got dressed in the most beautiful skirt you&rsquo;ve ever seen. It was the same colour as Harry&rsquo;s suit tonight. As you walked out of your dressing room you saw Harry by the stage but still in the back. He stood there like a dream. Kacey was on stage, doing the pre-show and he watched it. You saw Helene capture the moment, you smiled. You wanted to go and hug him casually but you knew that anyone could see you in a venue like this. You were sure even some fans saw Harry standing there. When he saw you watching him, he waved you to go there. You stood next to him. </p><p>&ldquo;You know that I love you, right?&rdquo; he asked still looking at the show. You looked at him and he looked at you. You couldn&rsquo;t answer and he saw that in your eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;I love you, Harry&rdquo; you said and you both turned your eyes back to the stage as Kacey finished her last song. Harry walked away to get ready and you just stayed there in your beautiful luxury clothes in a sold out venue watching your boyfriend, Harry Styles and you thought you should be happy. But you felt empty. You almost started crying, but you felt a hand on your back. You turned right and Louis stood there smiling. You smiled back. You were so emotional at that point that you hugged him tight.</p><p>&ldquo;Oi, girl&rdquo; he chuckled. He stayed with you the whole show and you two danced together to the songs. And when you cried during Sign of the Times, Just a Little Bit of Your Heart, Sweet Creature, If I Could Fly he gave you a tissue every time.&nbsp;After Harry did the whale he ran off stage and stopped by you. He was hyped and smiled widely.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you enjoy it?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;A lot&rdquo; you smiled and gave a kiss on his cheek. You three went back to the hotel together. When you were in the car, Louis spoke up.</p><p>&ldquo;Guys, I wanted to tell you that I gotta go back to the UK tomorrow. I&rsquo;ll try to come back as often as I can, but I got a great opportunity&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I was offered a seat in the X-Factor judges&rdquo; he smiled. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh my!&rdquo; you were surprised.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow! That&rsquo;s great. With Simon?&rdquo; Harry asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s funny, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hilarious and amazing&rdquo; Harry added. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna miss you both&rdquo; Lou said. </p><p>You were quite sad that he leaves because you became good friends since you first met him. And now in this weird situation with Harry you wanted Lou to stay, but it was amazing that he&rsquo;s gonna be a judge in the X-Factor. You packed up everything and traveled overnight again to Philadelphia. You slept in Harry&rsquo;s arms in the car, but it felt weird this time. </p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"1\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"2\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure></p>",
