As a little boy he had always wondered how someone could spend so much time with a boring tree that didn\u2019t answer and didn\u2019t react, but the older he got, the more he started to understand what Ned had been looking for.</p><p>Right now the tree was a calm in the storm. The courtyard of Winterfell was filled with soldiers and dragons. People were screaming, children were crying and horses were trampling around, terrified of the smell of death that lingered in the air. But here in the Godswood it was quiet and empty. It was the only place where the commander of the hugest army in the history of Westeros could think clearly.</p><p>Not that the huge amount of thinking he did lately got him anywhere. The army of the death was huge and endless. Whenever one of the living soldiers would fall, they would come back on the opposite side. At first they would simply fight stranger, nameless people with blue eyes. But then they would fight acquaintances and then they would fight friends.</p><p>It terrified him. Jon Snow, King in the North, dragon rider and the one living person who had seen death and lived to tell the tale, was terrified of what was to come. Not because he was afraid of dying himself. He had faced death way too often to still fear it. He was afraid of his loved ones dying. He was afraid of his friends and his family dying and not being as lucky as he had been. </p><p>But he was mostly afraid for her. He was afraid that somehow, at the end of the war, he would still be standing and she would be a corpse he would have to burn to death or fight to death. </p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d </p><p>He looked up when he heard her voice, only a couple of inches behind him. When she placed a hand on his shoulder, he placed his hand on top of hers. </p><!-- more --><p>\u201cYour army is waiting for you.\u201d She whispered. Whenever she stood in front of the crowd, right next to him, she always looked fierce, her chin up and her back straight. But whenever they were alone she lowered her guards and showed the softer side he had thought had been destroyed by the monsters she had met. \u201cThey&rsquo;re getting restless and they need someone to guide them.\u201d</p><p>Jon let out a deep sigh. \u201cAnd how should I be able to put them at ease?\u201d He looked at Sansa and her bright blue eyes stared straight into his. \u201cWe all know that people are dying. His army is growing. And we\u2019re here, doing nothing but waiting until he\u2019s close enough to fight him.\u201d He tensed all his muscles and clenched his fists. </p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Sansa nodded. \u201cWe talked about this often enough.\u201d She squeezed his shoulder. \u201cI know how hard it is for you to stay here, knowing that horrible things are happening outside these walls. But if we scatter the army, we don\u2019t stand a chance. We only have a chance if we fight as one.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes it seemed only yesterday that Sansa had been this pretty maiden giggling with her friends and dreaming of a prince charming to swipe her off her feet. </p><p>He had often thought her to be shallow and naive. And just like everyone else he had simply underestimated her. He had not seen her calm, her strength and her intelligence. He had never seen how amazing she truly was and he had been a fool not to see it.</p><p>\u201cBut all those people rely on you, Jon.\u201d She cocked her head slightly. She was taller than him, but somehow looking up at her was one of his favourite things to do. \u201cThey have no idea what\u2019s coming for them and what they will face. But you have and you have to remind them what we\u2019re fighting for.\u201d Sansa swallowed. \u201cWe&rsquo;re not fighting for a throne or power. We\u2019re fighting for Westeros and for the living to stay alive.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou should have been the queen.\u201d Jon tucked a strand of strawberry blond hair behind her ear. \u201cYou\u2019d be able to encourage even the most hopeless man.\u201d</p><p>Sansa smiled and curled her fingers around his wrist to press the palm of his hand to her cheek. \u201cAre you hopeless, Jon Snow?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know. Could he do this if he truly felt hopeless? Could he rally an army and lead it straight to their deaths if he believed it was hopeless? Could he ask people to fight a battle if he had no faith that there was a chance, however small, that they would win?</p><p>\u201cWe have a good strategy.\u201d Sansa stepped towards him and she pressed her forehead to his. \u201cAll we have to do is kill the night king to kill them all.\u201d She firmly believed that, even though he had told her over and over again that it was nothing but a theory, a theory that could cost thousands of lives if proven wrong. But she seemed to believe in him, in the theory and in their chances to survive. </p><p>And so he believed too. Maybe not so much in himself, but in her. \u201cIf we win this war\u2026\u201d Jon cleared his throat, but Sansa grabbed his lips and kept them shut before he could continue.</p><p>\u201cWhen we win this war.\u201d She spoke firmly now and she placed her other hand on his chest. \u201cWinning this war is not an if. It\u2019s a when.\u201d</p><p>Jon smiled at her and she let his lips go again. \u201cWhen we win this war, I will make you the queen you deserve to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe queen in the North?\u201d Sansa wrapped her arms around his neck and her lips brushed his.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Jon shook his head and kissed her firmly. \u201cThe queen of everything. The North. Westeros. The world.\u201d He paused to kiss her again. \u201cBut most of all the queen of my heart.\u201d</p><p>Sansa buried her hands in his hair. \u201cAre you implying now that I\u2019m not the queen of your heart yet?\u201d</p><p>His arms circled around her waist and he pressed her as tightly to his body as possible. \u201cNo\u2026\u201d He lifted her up. \u201cYou already have my heart.\u201d He slowly walked away from the tree in the Godswood, towards the courtyard and the castle. \u201cYou already have my everything.\u201d He ignored everyone staring at them. \u201cAnd you already are my everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have soldiers to command, King Jon Snow.\u201d Sansa whispered, but Jon only smirked back.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d He used his foot to kick the wooden door open. \u201cI have love to make.\u201d</p>",

He was afraid of his friends and his family dying and not being as lucky as he had been. </p><p>But he was mostly afraid for her.

When she placed a hand on his shoulder, he placed his hand on top of hers. </p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cYour army is waiting for you.\u201d She whispered. Whenever she stood in front of the crowd, right next to him, she always looked fierce, her chin up and her back straight. But whenever they were alone she lowered her guards and showed the softer side he had thought had been destroyed by the monsters she had met. \u201cThey\u2019re getting restless and they need someone to guide them.\u201d</p><p>Jon let out a deep sigh. \u201cAnd how should I be able to put them at ease?\u201d He looked at Sansa and her bright blue eyes stared straight into his. \u201cWe all know that people are dying. His army is growing. And we\u2019re here, doing nothing but waiting until he\u2019s close enough to fight him.\u201d He tensed all his muscles and clenched his fists. </p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Sansa nodded. \u201cWe talked about this often enough.\u201d She squeezed his shoulder. \u201cI know how hard it is for you to stay here, knowing that horrible things are happening outside these walls. But if we scatter the army, we don\u2019t stand a chance. We only have a chance if we fight as one.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes it seemed only yesterday that Sansa had been this pretty maiden giggling with her friends and dreaming of a prince charming to swipe her off her feet. </p><p>He had often thought her to be shallow and naive.

He had never seen how amazing she truly was and he had been a fool not to see it.</p><p>\u201cBut all those people rely on you, Jon.\u201d She cocked her head slightly. She was taller than him, but somehow looking up at her was one of his favourite things to do. \u201cThey have no idea what\u2019s coming for them and what they will face. But you have and you have to remind them what we\u2019re fighting for.\u201d Sansa swallowed. \u201cWe\u2019re not fighting for a throne or power. We\u2019re fighting for Westeros and for the living to stay alive.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou should have been the queen.\u201d Jon tucked a strand of strawberry blond hair behind her ear. \u201cYou\u2019d be able to encourage even the most hopeless man.\u201d</p><p>Sansa smiled and curled her fingers around his wrist to press the palm of his hand to her cheek. \u201cAre you hopeless, Jon Snow?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know.

The central\u00a0\u201cmistake\u201d of Robb was to disregard his responsibilities and honor as King by breaking the marriage pact he had agreed to with the Freys. \u00a0Not only did Robb go back on his word, his actions lead to thousands of deaths and the victory of the Lannisters. \u00a0The implication of Sansa and Lord Glover\u2019s words is that Robb\u2019s decision to marry for love was foolish and irresponsible.</p><p>When Sansa tells Jon that he needs to be smarter, the two don\u2019t specifically discuss what Robb actually did, but the foreshadowing of Jon\u2019s future context is clear. \u00a0Robb\u2019s downfall occurred because he followed his heart instead of doing his duty as a King by keeping his word. \u00a0Although Jon Snow\u2019s situation with Daenerys is not identical, there are important parallels. \u00a0Robb jeopardized and ultimately lost his life and his title, thereby destroying the Northern claim, by making the rash decision to marry Talissa. \u00a0It literally cost him everything and thousands of his men were killed. \u00a0This is why Sansa called it a stupid mistake. \u00a0Although a case can be made that Jon\u2019s decision to forgive the Umbers and the Karstarks was the right one, Sansa is no doubt thinking of other things that Jon has done when she counsels him. \u00a0Jon went against Sansa\u2019s advice regarding the number of men needed to attack the Bolton\u2019s, and he also fell into Ramsay\u2019s trap by charging at him during the Battle of the Bastards. \u00a0The show is sending a message that Jon could be about to make more mistakes, just like Robb, and the mistakes could be related to acting on emotion rather than using logic. \u00a0They could also be related to behaving selfishly instead of keeping the greater good in mind. \u00a0</p><p>Although the audience does not get a window into Jon Snow\u2019s thought processes with regard to Daenerys in season 7, he at first refuses to bend the knee to her when she demands it of him. \u00a0His reasons include the foundations of her claim (based upon her father\u2019s claim) and his sense that the North would not submit to her. \u00a0Indeed he was specifically warned about the Targaryens before he departed for Dragonstone. \u00a0Jon would like to get Dany\u2019s support and to be able to receive her dragonglass, but not at the cost of bending the knee. \u00a0He would like an alliance, but not one which involves submitting the North to a Targaryen.</p><p>Eventually, Jon does submit to her as Queen, and his problem upon returning home is going to be how this will be received by the Northern Lords and Jon\u2019s own family. \u00a0Once the nature of his relationship with Dany becomes known, there will be protestations that he has taken up with a foreign woman in the same manner as Robb Stark. \u00a0The implication will be similar: \u00a0Jon is rashly giving away the North \u00a0in order to follow his heart. \u00a0The central question for the audience is whether Jon is making a stupid mistake or if he is actually behaving rationally.\u00a0The answer to this question will perhaps rest upon whether Dany makes the difference against the Night King. \u00a0In this case, Jon\u2019s bending the knee may garner support from Northerners.\u00a0 However, if Cersei is going to attack from the South with the Golden Company and the North suffers heavy losses anyway, Jon will likely be blamed for bending the knee to Dany and thus exposing the North.</p><p>As of yet in the series, Jon Snow is unaware of his true parentage. Out of his sense of himself as a Stark and a Northerner he believes (whether he loves Dany or not), that he is doing what has to be done against a massive existential threat. \u00a0In light of the new trailer, it looks as though Sansa and the other key players in the show will have to accept Dany\u2019s support for the battle against the Night King and the Whitewalkers.

The central\u00a0\u201cmistake\u201d of Robb was to disregard his responsibilities and honor as King by breaking the marriage pact he had agreed to with the Freys. \u00a0Not only did Robb go back on his word, his actions lead to thousands of deaths and the victory of the Lannisters. \u00a0The implication of Sansa and Lord Glover\u2019s words is that Robb\u2019s decision to marry for love was foolish and irresponsible.</p><p>When Sansa tells Jon that he needs to be smarter, the two don\u2019t specifically discuss what Robb actually did, but the foreshadowing of Jon\u2019s future context is clear. \u00a0Robb\u2019s downfall occurred because he followed his heart instead of doing his duty as a King by keeping his word. \u00a0Although Jon Snow\u2019s situation with Daenerys is not identical, there are important parallels. \u00a0Robb jeopardized and ultimately lost his life and his title, thereby destroying the Northern claim, by making the rash decision to marry Talissa. \u00a0It literally cost him everything and thousands of his men were killed. \u00a0This is why Sansa called it a stupid mistake. \u00a0Although a case can be made that Jon\u2019s decision to forgive the Umbers and the Karstarks was the right one, Sansa is no doubt thinking of other things that Jon has done when she counsels him. \u00a0Jon went against Sansa\u2019s advice regarding the number of men needed to attack the Bolton\u2019s, and he also fell into Ramsay\u2019s trap by charging at him during the Battle of the Bastards. \u00a0The show is sending a message that Jon could be about to make more mistakes, just like Robb, and the mistakes could be related to acting on emotion rather than using logic. \u00a0They could also be related to behaving selfishly instead of keeping the greater good in mind. \u00a0</p><p>Although the audience does not get a window into Jon Snow\u2019s thought processes with regard to Daenerys in season 7, he at first refuses to bend the knee to her when she demands it of him. \u00a0His reasons include the foundations of her claim (based upon her father\u2019s claim) and his sense that the North would not submit to her. \u00a0Indeed he was specifically warned about the Targaryens before he departed for Dragonstone. \u00a0Jon would like to get Dany\u2019s support and to be able to receive her dragonglass, but not at the cost of bending the knee. \u00a0He would like an alliance, but not one which involves submitting the North to a Targaryen.</p><p>Eventually, Jon does submit to her as Queen, and his problem upon returning home is going to be how this will be received by the Northern Lords and Jon\u2019s own family. \u00a0Once the nature of his relationship with Dany becomes known, there will be protestations that he has taken up with a foreign woman in the same manner as Robb Stark. \u00a0The implication will be similar: \u00a0Jon is rashly giving away the North \u00a0in order to follow his heart. \u00a0The central question for the audience is whether Jon is making a stupid mistake or if he is actually behaving rationally.\u00a0The answer to this question will perhaps rest upon whether Dany makes the difference against the Night King. \u00a0In this case, Jon\u2019s bending the knee may garner support from Northerners.\u00a0 However, if Cersei is going to attack from the South with the Golden Company and the North suffers heavy losses anyway, Jon will likely be blamed for bending the knee to Dany and thus exposing the North.</p><p>As of yet in the series, Jon Snow is unaware of his true parentage. Out of his sense of himself as a Stark and a Northerner he believes (whether he loves Dany or not), that he is doing what has to be done against a massive existential threat. \u00a0In light of the new trailer, it looks as though Sansa and the other key players in the show will have to accept Dany\u2019s support for the battle against the Night King and the Whitewalkers. This battle is going to happen in episode 3, so the remainder of the show is going to be concerned with the aftermath and the consequences of Jon\u2019s alliance in the context of a probable attack from Cersei and the parentage reveal. \u00a0</p>",
