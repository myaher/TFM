Best of both worlds.",

They <i>could </i>be and, as I said in the ask I answered, I do find the kidnapping plot more likely than Sansa willingly meeting with Cersei. And when I talked about this a few months ago, I protested as much as the next guy. I just couldn\u2019t believe Sansa would <i>ever </i>do something so risky and dumb.\n\nBut I also think the writers could create a situation where the characters would feel forced to make risky decisions, because they\u2019ve done it before and whether or not we think it makes sense doesn\u2019t matter to them.</p><hr><h2><b>So today I say: let\u2019s speculate because I want to have fun, damn it.</b></h2><p>Sansa and the Starks might find themselves in a situation where they\u2019re desperate enough to want to risk it. That\u2019s the whole thing. Trusting Cersei isn\u2019t smart, no, but they can be written into a scenario where they\u2019d rather trust Cersei being Cersei\u2013because there is predictability in that\u2013than trusting the mercurial, unpredictable D\u00e6nerys. It will basically be choosing between two evils, because if they don\u2019t choose they\u2019ll <b>die</b>. Also, if Bran\u2019s still alive they can use him to their advantage\u2013something Jon couldn\u2019t do when he met up with Cersei or D*ny.</p><p>It really boils down to giving Cersei an offer she can\u2019t refuse. She could refuse the truce and she could lie about the truce because D*ny is her number one enemy and her number one threat (for the simple reason that D*ny wants her throne; the Starks would leave Cersei be if she let them be). And by lying so that D\u00e6nerys headed north, Cersei bought herself time to get more resources and fortifying her defenses. <b>She also created a situation where her biggest enemy would most likely suffer losses while Cersei\u2019s armies remained strong.</b></p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThe dead will come north first.

She knows that D*ny has already lost one dragon (and she\u2019s smart enough to figure out that it quite possibly happened while procuring that wight) and that means D*ny could lose more. If Cersei\u2019s lucky, the NK and D*ny will both die in the war and then Cersei wins without doing a single thing but lying.<br/></p><p>But if the NK dies and D\u00e6nerys still has her eye on the throne and she still has one or two dragons and large armies, and Cersei has a chance to team up with more houses to defend Westeros from the invader, she might just do it. Because it benefits <i>her</i>\u2013especially if one of the conditions is that Jon will renounce his claim to the throne.</p><p>And, yes, it\u2019s risky. But they all might be willing to take that risk because it sure beats being burned alive.</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\n\u201cWe can never hope to defeat [her] alone. We need allies, powerful allies. I know it\u2019s a risk. But I have to take it.\u201d\n\n</i><br/></p></blockquote><p>But, yeah, we could get both, like I suggested in the previous answer. We could get a kidnapped Sansa who manages to work out a deal with Cersei rather than getting tortured or murdered or whatever it is Cersei\u2019s got planned.</p><p>Regardless of what happens, I just want Sansa to have some agency and to use the skills she\u2019s honed ever since leaving home.</p><p>Thanks for the ask!<br/></p>",

He didn\u2019t know who left the books, but they were here every morning when he arrived, replacing the stack he left behind after a long day of writing. He already knew what dedication to write in his newest novel. Because whomever left the poems had crafted the backbone of this story and had given his words wings.</p><p>On the few rare days without a stack welcoming him, he never managed to write anything. Not a single line. Not a single word. Not a single letter. But on all the other days he wrote pages and sentences as if writing was easy, as if creativity wasn\u2019t an incident, as if inspiration was not deeply buried whenever he needed it. </p><!-- more --><p>A few times he had contemplated showing up early, but there had always been that shimmer of fear holding him back. There was a certain beauty in inspiring secrets, a beauty that could be shattered by knowing. And yet, he couldn\u2019t imagine to be disappointed in anyone who was capable of crafting love letters with words not even their own. </p><p>However, instead of wandering around the library to have a look at the librarians or daily customers, he wrote. He wrote about love. He wrote about longing. He wrote about two lovers far apart and yet connect, their souls two pieces of the same puzzle, beautiful on their own, but only complete together. And at the end of the day, when the story had grown by three more chapters, he wrote a few more lines. </p><p>But this time with stolen words.</p><figure class=\"tweaks-full-width-gifs\" data-orig-height=\"640\" data-orig-width=\"640\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5988bfdb56378f8213f32a8820416b21/tumblr_inline_pokw6sRCXP1qdb55z_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"640\" data-orig-width=\"640\"/></figure><p><i>This splintered silence<br/>\nHeartbeat<br/>\nThe beauty of darkness<br/>\nHeartbeat<br/>\nBeautiful Creatures<br/>\nDefy the Stars</i></p><p>With a smile on his face he closed the door of the small private room at the very back of the library behind him and even though some secrets were sweet he glanced at all the people he walked past on his way to the exit. Maybe his muse was now staring at him, just like he was staring at them. And maybe, just like him, they were afraid of ruining the magic of the unknown.</p><p>When he returned the next day however his desk was empty. The stack he had left had disappeared, but no new stack had been left behind. And even though he knew his muse probably simply had a day off or more important matters to think about, he couldn\u2019t help but fear that this time the poems wouldn\u2019t return and would be gone forever.</p><p>But just when he had opened his laptop, even though he already knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to write today, a soft knock on the door echoed through the small private room at the very back of the library. </p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d He looked over his shoulder and watched how the door opened slightly to reveal a beautiful red haired girl with piercing blue eyes that seemed to stare straight into his bare soul. </p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d Her voice was firm, but it trembled a little as if even just talking to him made her nervous. \u201cDo you mind if I come in for a moment?\u201d</p><p>He actually had to tell her that he was working, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to do so. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to lie to her. He would not be working today. At least by talking to her he would do something somehow useful. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>She pushed the door further open and her high heels ticked on the floor when she walked in. In her arms she carried a stack of books and her cheeks heated up when she noticed his glance wandering over the titles. \u201cI thought that maybe\u2026\u201d She hesitated. \u201cMaybe it was time to finally deliver the stack in person.\u201d She placed the books on the edge of his desk and stuck a strand of hair behind her ear.</p><figure class=\"tweaks-full-width-gifs\" data-orig-height=\"640\" data-orig-width=\"640\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2028b908cce15b9611d02f5771d786dd/tumblr_inline_pokw74yjg81qdb55z_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"640\" data-orig-width=\"640\"/></figure><p><i>The Shadow Queen<br/>\nThe Sleeping Prince<br/>\nSoulmates<br/>\nFallen in Love</i></p><p>Just like every day his finger traced the words and just like every day a smile spread across his face. \u201cWhy today?\u201d He whispered, his throat all of a sudden dry and his hands all of a sudden trembling. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She shifted her weight and licked her lips. \u201cA hunch? A sudden strike of courage? The fact that this is the last day of my internship and I won\u2019t be here anymore tomorrow?\u201d She cocked her head. \u201cI have nothing to lose and everything to win. Because\u2026\u201d She gestured at the stack of books. \u201cI want to get to know the man behind the words. And either he wants to get to know me too, or I will leave knowing that at least I\u2019ve tried.\u201d</p><p>Slowly Jon stood up from his seat and walked towards her. He had never wondered what his muse would look like, or sound like, or move like. None of that had ever mattered. His muse had been a feeling, a certain emotion that could always brighten his most horrible moods, a constant presence. </p><p>But now she was standing in front of him. A beautiful young woman, slightly taller than him and a little flustered and insecure. </p><p>Even if he had tried to imagine what his muse would look like, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to come up with and image even half as pretty as she truly was. \u201cI&rsquo;d love to get to know you.\u201d He placed his hands on her shoulders and where his hands touched her a pleasant warmth made his skin tingle. \u201cAlthough it kinda feels like I already do.\u201d </p><p>When she looked up at him with a glimmer in her bright blue eyes his heart skipped a beat in his chest. </p><p>There was a certain beauty in having an unknown muse. It had certainly led to the best book he had ever written. But now it was time for the finale and if his current feelings were an indication of what was to come, it was gonna be spectacularly perfect.</p>",

On the edge of his desk laid a new stack of books and he cocked his head to let his eyes wander over the titles on the spines. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8c0dc41e588eadf360fdf46305f2c3d2/tumblr_inline_pokw66VYyc1qdb55z_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>Hush Hush<br />\nHere we are now<br />\nBeyond a darkened shore<br />\nOur dark duet<br />\nAwaken<br />\nThe Art of Feeling</i></p>\n<p>His fingers traced each word and he murmured them aloud even though there was no one present to hear him. He didn&rsquo;t know who left the books, but they were here every morning when he arrived, replacing the stack he left behind after a long day of writing. He already knew what dedication to write in his newest novel. Because whomever left the poems had crafted the backbone of this story and had given his words wings.</p>\n<p>On the few rare days without a stack welcoming him, he never managed to write anything. Not a single line. Not a single word. Not a single letter. But on all the other days he wrote pages and sentences as if writing was easy, as if creativity wasn&rsquo;t an incident, as if inspiration was not deeply buried whenever he needed it. </p>\n</p>",
