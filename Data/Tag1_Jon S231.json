I have major respect for those who have time to create gifs from movies/shows. You guys make it possible for us to create crackships so if I do end up using your base gifs and you want credit then just let me know \u2764\nWelcome to all my new followers and thank you for following this crazy blog \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\nRequests open Friday morning to Saturday morning.",

BUT since all of my shipping energy is devoted to Braime and Gendrya I just don\u2019t have anything left for other ships! Because of this I am neither Team Jonsa or Team Jonerys, but it has become such a huge part of the fandom its hard not to form an opinion.\u00a0</p><p>First I think its important to make sure we\u2019re separating our actors from our characters, because while Kit has great chemistry with both Sophie and Emilia, JON has great chemistry with Sansa, but watching him with Dany last season was about as exciting as watching paint dry&hellip;</p><p>I\u2019ll come back to that, but let\u2019s start with Jonsa first:\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019m really not here for anymore incest in GoT, and while I know that technically they\u2019re only cousins and not siblings, they were still raised in the same home as half brother and sister, even though they didn\u2019t have much of a relationship in their youth. However, detractors of this ship who use their familial relationship to completely write off the the ship are forgetting a little something&hellip; GRRM. He doesn\u2019t seem to have to have the same compunction about this topic as the anti\u2019s do, in his original outline for the books he had a storyline where Arya (yikes, I can\u2019t even think about it!) and Jon fall in love and are tortured by this love UNTIL they find out about Jon\u2019s true parentage. Now we know he moved on from that storyline, but did he move on, or just pivot? Another part of the original outline was that Arya was going to be part of an unwitting love triangle, as Tyrion, who abandons his family to fight on the side of the Stark&rsquo;s develops feelings for her, albeit unrequited&hellip; now can we think about a different Stark family member that GRRM pivoted a messy, and complicated relationship with Tyrion to? So if he salvaged some semblance of his original outline by transferring plot points to Sansa, its not out of the question that he would do the same for other plot points. Also people who say there\u2019s no canonical evidence for Jonsa are choosing not to pay attention. I mean, you don\u2019t gaze longingly at your\u00a0\u201csister\u2019s\u201d lips, after kissing her on the forehead! Go find the gif, I\u2019m not kidding, he kisses her forehead, looks her in the eye\u2019s then looks down at her lips, and just pauses there! Anti\u2019s you might not want it to happen, but it very possibly could happen\u00a0</p><p>Now, onto Jonerys:\u00a0</p><p>(I know they\u2019re technically related too, but they weren\u2019t raised together, so it doesn\u2019t factor into my opinion, thats just what this ridiculous show has done to me!!) I know I said I\u2019m not much of a Dany fan, but I\u2019m going to put that aside, and just look at the evidence provided to us in the show. I think Jon and Dany\u2019s relationship, as presented in season 7 is legit, meaning I\u2019m not really here for the political!jon theories (not because it\u2019s not an interesting idea, I just don\u2019t think D&amp;D are that creative)&hellip; so, I think Jon comes to care about Dany (yes, even if he also cares for Sansa - you can have feelings for two people at once) and I think Dany\u2019s feelings for Jon are also real. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they are end game, it just means that going into the last season we\u2019re going to see from Dany where her true priorities lie. When she learns there is a surviving Targaryen that has a more legitimate claim to the throne than she does (this is putting aside the fact that I don\u2019t think she has a claim at all, nor does Jon for that matter - but that\u2019s a topic for a different post, lol!) this is the moment that will tell us what kind of person Dany is, and will end up being. She\u2019s either going to acknowledge the claim, or fight against it - there\u2019s really no other option. If she fights against it then I don\u2019t exactly see their relationship surviving that? So she\u2019ll have to decide if love or power is what she wants more. Now I think if D&amp;D had 100% say over how the show ends then they\u2019d have Jon, despite learning of his parentage,\u00a0\u201cgive\u201d the throne to Dany, or at least marry her and rule together (I\u2019ve not seen such huge Dany stan\u2019s as D&amp;D since Jorah!!) Dany would be the hero!! But since we know they\u2019re beholden to GRRM\u2019s ending for the books, I think he\u2019s got a little more imagination than that. I don\u2019t know if Dany will go all Mad Queen, I don\u2019t even necessarily think she\u2019d be a bad ruler (though I do agree with Daario that\u2019s she\u2019s more of a conqueror than a ruler, but\u00a0  \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af) but I just don\u2019t think GRRM would end his series so predictably. The only reason I think Jon should\u00a0\u201cwin\u201d is becasue he doesn\u2019t want to rule, and in stories like this it\u2019s always the people who have leadership thrust upon them that do the best job, the one\u2019s who rule because its the right thing to do, and not out of a lust for power.

I mean, you don&rsquo;t gaze longingly at your&nbsp;&ldquo;sister&rsquo;s&rdquo; lips, after kissing her on the forehead! Go find the gif, I&rsquo;m not kidding, he kisses her forehead, looks her in the eye&rsquo;s then looks down at her lips, and just pauses there! Anti&rsquo;s you might not want it to happen, but it very possibly could happen&nbsp;</p><p>Now, onto Jonerys:&nbsp;</p><p>(I know they&rsquo;re technically related too, but they weren&rsquo;t raised together, so it doesn&rsquo;t factor into my opinion, thats just what this ridiculous show has done to me!!) I know I said I&rsquo;m not much of a Dany fan, but I&rsquo;m going to put that aside, and just look at the evidence provided to us in the show. I think Jon and Dany&rsquo;s relationship, as presented in season 7 is legit, meaning I&rsquo;m not really here for the political!jon theories (not because it&rsquo;s not an interesting idea, I just don&rsquo;t think D&amp;D are that creative)&hellip; so, I think Jon comes to care about Dany (yes, even if he also cares for Sansa - you can have feelings for two people at once) and I think Dany&rsquo;s feelings for Jon are also real. That doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean they are end game, it just means that going into the last season we&rsquo;re going to see from Dany where her true priorities lie. When she learns there is a surviving Targaryen that has a more legitimate claim to the throne than she does (this is putting aside the fact that I don&rsquo;t think she has a claim at all, nor does Jon for that matter - but that&rsquo;s a topic for a different post, lol!) this is the moment that will tell us what kind of person Dany is, and will end up being. She&rsquo;s either going to acknowledge the claim, or fight against it - there&rsquo;s really no other option. If she fights against it then I don&rsquo;t exactly see their relationship surviving that? So she&rsquo;ll have to decide if love or power is what she wants more. Now I think if D&amp;D had 100% say over how the show ends then they&rsquo;d have Jon, despite learning of his parentage,&nbsp;&ldquo;give&rdquo; the throne to Dany, or at least marry her and rule together (I&rsquo;ve not seen such huge Dany stan&rsquo;s as D&amp;D since Jorah!!) Dany would be the hero!! But since we know they&rsquo;re beholden to GRRM&rsquo;s ending for the books, I think he&rsquo;s got a little more imagination than that. I don&rsquo;t know if Dany will go all Mad Queen, I don&rsquo;t even necessarily think she&rsquo;d be a bad ruler (though I do agree with Daario that&rsquo;s she&rsquo;s more of a conqueror than a ruler, but&nbsp;  &macr;\\_(&#12484;)_/&macr;) but I just don&rsquo;t think GRRM would end his series so predictably. The only reason I think Jon should&nbsp;&ldquo;win&rdquo; is becasue he doesn&rsquo;t want to rule, and in stories like this it&rsquo;s always the people who have leadership thrust upon them that do the best job, the one&rsquo;s who rule because its the right thing to do, and not out of a lust for power. By that estimation I&rsquo;d be just as happy if Sam, or Gendry, or Davos ended up King (actually Davos would make a great King&hellip; side note, this blog is now a Davos for King blog, lol) Okay, I said before I&rsquo;d get back to the&nbsp;&ldquo;watching paint dry&rdquo; comment, and here it it, its true, they were boring! I&rsquo;m sorry, I just didn&rsquo;t buy their courtship AT ALL in season 7, again I don&rsquo;t think this is purposeful i.e. Jon hiding some secret plot, I just think it was a matter of pacing. We&rsquo;re so used to watching things move so slowly on this show, that to slam all that happened between them in season 7 into just 7 episodes, it just wasn&rsquo;t believable to me, and all the&nbsp;&ldquo;he&rsquo;s not in love with me&rdquo; and&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen you staring at her heart *wink, wink*&rdquo; moments felt so forced. I think because of the pace, we weren&rsquo;t able to enjoy any pining, or build up, it was, &ldquo;look here&rsquo;s our two stars, aren&rsquo;t they pretty? They&rsquo;re gonna bang&rdquo;&hellip; then they did. I just wasn&rsquo;t here for it, and the actors didn&rsquo;t seem to be either, hence the paint drying boredom of their performances.</p><p><b>tl/dr</b>: Yes, Jonerys is real, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean its end game&hellip; and yes Jonsa could happen. But I don&rsquo;t really care either way, I just want Jaime to kiss Brienne, and Gendry to get Arya all flustered by calling her m&rsquo;lady in front of her family, and Davos is King now, that a new rule I just made but is a good rule! Okay, bye! </p></p>",
