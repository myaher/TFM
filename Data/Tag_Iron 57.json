        "body": "<h1>Imagine going undercover on a mission</h1><p><b>Request</b>: <i>i absolutely love this blog!! it makes me very happy :) would you possibly write one where the team makes the reader go undercover for a mission and she\u2019s nervous for it but agrees and then something bad happens &amp; they have to help her with a fluffy ending? thank you!!!</i></p><p><b>Author\u2019s Note</b>: <i>Hello! Thank you so much for requesting this! It was a lot of fun to make! I did make it a little different, but I promise it has all the fluff you want in the end! I really hope you enjoy! Keep the requests coming!</i></p><p><b>Pairing(s)</b>: <i>Tony Stark x Daughter!Reader, Avengers x Reader</i></p><p>The violins synchronized beautifully, people either dancing to the slow music or walking around to admire the scenery. The ball was in full swing, Y/N amongst them in a long golden gown that shimmered every time she walked underneath the beautifully crafted chandelier. She looked absolutely beautiful, but if one looked closer, they&rsquo;d see an earpiece pressed in her right ear, voices from the heroes as well as her father pooling in and giving her directions. This wasn&rsquo;t her first undercover mission, but this was the first time it was more than just Natasha giving her instructions. That was back before her father even knew Nick recruited his daughter for things like this. When he initially found out, he was absolutely furious. But she was good at her job. His only conditions was he had to be present during the missions, able to watch with the hidden cameras. The one she wore now was in disguise on her diamond necklace. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;This place is a shithole,&rdquo; Clint commented idly. &ldquo;The music, too. Who even goes to things like this and has a genuine good time?&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Rich snobs. Sorry, Tony,&rdquo; Sam snorted. Steve had decided to come with Bucky and Sam. Since Bucky got better at Wakanda, Steve had a habit of bringing the two of them everywhere. It was like he was trying to spend as much time with him as he could. &ldquo;Y/N, while you&rsquo;re there, can you snag me some of the shrimp in your purse? That&rsquo;s probably the only good shit there.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Me, too,&rdquo; Bucky agreed. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;All of you shut up! Y/N, keep your eyes on the prize. Remember, his name&rsquo;s Ophelius Palmer. Bigger guy. Hides in plain sight. You remember his appearance?&rdquo; Natasha asked, allowing Y/N to hear her type away on the keyboard available to her. Y/N only wished she was here with her on this mission. But they needed Ophelius to find their undercover man instead of vice versa. Y/N Stark had the better name, unfortunately, due to her money supply and father. &ldquo;Guest list says he arrived after you. He should be somewhere around there.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this,&rdquo; Tony said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this at all.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Dad, I&rsquo;ve done this before,&rdquo; Y/N whispered, trying not to draw attention to herself as she took a glass of champagne off of one of the trays a woman was walking around with. She walked around, weaving through the people as she looked around. He had to be here somewhere, but she understood she had to be as subtle as possible. If Ophelius saw her looking for him, the plan would be ruined. He was paranoid as is. </p><p><br/></p><p>Ophelius was a notorious mob boss with a knack for killing off his allies in an attempt to keep his reputation superior. Yet people still wanted to work with him; they probably figured they&rsquo;d get a piece of the cash load he had. This ball had something he wanted: Y/N Stark. What better way to catch him than to throw the bait? Tony had originally pleaded not to have her go out there, but this was the perfect opportunity. Besides, Y/N could handle herself just fine. She&rsquo;s trained with Natasha for several months now. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we just march in there and grab him?&rdquo; Tony asked. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;What would be your reaction if you saw someone coming after you?&rdquo; Bruce asked coolly. </p><p><br/></p><p>Y/N could hear her father huff in annoyance. Y/N knew the answer. If Ophelius saw Earth&rsquo;s mightiest heroes marching in to get him, he could just pull out a gun and attack everyone inside to prevent his capture. Of course, she knew Tony wouldn&rsquo;t do that if he was being taken. He would, however, do everything else to ensure his escape.</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;There he is,&rdquo; Y/N whispered, her eyes widening as she saw him enter the room, tailed by two sharply dressed men and one scantily clad woman hanging off his arm. His three better lackies. They could fight like nobody&rsquo;s business. They were pretty handy with guns, too. In fact, Y/N was willing to bet they were carrying right now. &ldquo;I just need him to see me.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; Natasha and Tony said simultaneously.</p><p><br/></p><p>Y/N nodded, despite knowing they probably couldn&rsquo;t see her. She sipped at the champagne she was holding, slowly walking so she was in his line of sight. She tossed her hair over her shoulder, glancing here and there as if she were bored by the party itself and wanted better company. She held her breath. This had to work; if it didn&rsquo;t, so many people could get hurt. However, her prayers seemed to be answered quicker than not seeing as she suddenly saw him descending down the grand staircase in her direction. She tried to appear as if she didn&rsquo;t notice him, finding a small statue particularly interesting. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Miss Stark, I presume?&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>She turned, flinching in automatic surprise. He was a lot bigger up close. Nevertheless, she politely stuck her hand out for him to shake. Instead of doing so, he took it up to his mouth to kiss. Y/N could hear Steve, her father, and Bucky mumbling incoherent threats in her earpiece for Ophelius simply touching her.</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;You know me?&rdquo; she asked. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Who doesn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not much of a celebrity in India. Although&hellip;my father has his name written in big letters there. Perhaps the Stark name can only turn a few heads here and in London,&rdquo; Y/N smiled, sipping at her drink and glancing at the woman still hugging on Ophelius as if he were some kind of lifeline. She was staring at Y/N as if she were some kind of monster in plain sight. She could tell there was envy in her eyes as Ophelius kept his attention on her. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;What brings you to the ball, then?&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Curiosity, mostly, but I also heard about the open bar. Someone like me tends to get stuff for free,&rdquo; Y/N really hated herself right now. She hated talking this way. It was so obnoxious and not necessary. But if it would convince Ophelius and his people, she would continue doing it. &ldquo;However, I&rsquo;ve yet to find someone worth talking to.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking to me.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Yes, exactly.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>Ophelius smiled, flattered. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Did your father decide to skip the opportunity?&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>Y/N slowly nodded. &ldquo;He had business in Washington. Otherwise he&rsquo;d be here cracking skulls and drinking about a half more than I am.&rdquo; </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t drink that much!&rdquo; Tony exclaimed angrily. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure he is in Washington?&rdquo; Ophelius asked, confused. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Yes, he is. Being Iron Man tends to make you move where the foot traffic is for danger.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Okay, just checking. Go ahead, Elise.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>The woman on his arm smirked, quickly sliding from him and wrapping an arm tightly around Y/N&rsquo;s waist. She felt the faint point of a knife at her spine, knowing exactly what was going on. She continued to smile, however, grinning happily up at Ophelius as if nothing were wrong.</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t wanna do this,&rdquo; Y/N sang softly. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Do what? Y/N, talk to me. What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Natasha asked, obviously unaware of the knife at Y/N&rsquo;s back.</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I do. If your father really is far from here, it gives me the opportunity to move you out as fast as I can. Make one move, Elise can paralyze you from the legs down,&rdquo; Ophelius explained, instantly telling the heroes exactly what was going on, but Y/N didn&rsquo;t hear a voice tell her to run or not to worry or anything. It was complete silence, but she couldn&rsquo;t focus on that. She had to focus on winning this mission, no matter what. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m warning you now, don&rsquo;t do this,&rdquo; Y/N said. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go. Warner! Briggs! Go bring the car around. Send Turner in for a the jet. We&rsquo;re leaving tonight,&rdquo; Ophelius turned his back, giving Y/N the perfect opportunity. Jerking her head back, she sent it straight into Elise&rsquo;s nose. The girl yelped and jerked away, Y/N ripping the knife from her hands and going to jab it right into Ophelius&rsquo; shoulder blade, but he wasn&rsquo;t in charge for nothing. He expected the attack.</p><p><br/></p><p>Swinging around, he gripped her wrist. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;So now we&rsquo;re making this everyone else&rsquo;s business, hm?&rdquo; he asked tauntingly. This made her aware that the music had stopped; people were watching them in shock. &ldquo;Just because you learned a few tricks doesn&rsquo;t mean you get to suddenly step into the shoes of a heroine, doll. You ain&rsquo;t shit.&rdquo; He twisted her wrist enough for her to drop the knife, before he pulled his hands from his coat pocket and protruded a gun. Y/N didn&rsquo;t have time to think. Just as she heard the gunshot, she ducked away, readying herself for the pain. But it never came. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Steve?&rdquo; she exclaimed, surprised to see him standing right before her, clutching his shield despite not being suited up. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Get out of here, now!&rdquo; he urged, standing straight and throwing his shield expertly at Ophelius, who merely ducked and had it graze his shiny, bald head. As Y/N looked around, she could see all of them had arrived, either suited up or just clutching the weapons they needed. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;I have reinforcements, too,&rdquo; she smirked to Ophelius, moving around Steve and taking off after him. He took off in the opposite direction, being surprisingly fast. Warner and Briggs moved protectively in front of their boss, both clutching their own guns. They looked similar to the class mafia guns Y/N saw in old cartoons. It was like they were working for Al Capone. She moved her hand to the bottom of her dress, retrieving her own weapon that was strapped to her leg. Natasha had taught her the perfect way to stash weapons. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Put them down and stand aside by order of SHIELD,&rdquo; she demanded angrily, aiming. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Two to one, sweetheart. No way you can get outta this,&rdquo; Briggs chuckled. However, his happiness was short lived. Thor proved to be an excellent tackler, sending him to the ground with ease with a shoulder to his mouth. Warner turned his gun to him instead, but Y/N whipped around, hitting him hard against the head with the bottom of her gun and knocking him out. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Well done, Lady Y/N!&rdquo; Thor exclaimed happily, raising a hand for her to high five. By now, the guests were all rushing toward the exits, fearful of anymore gunshots from them. Y/N could see now everyone was standing around her, Natasha holding Elise tightly in a hold.</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip;what are you waiting for?&rdquo; she asked breathlessly. &ldquo;Go get Ophelius. Finish your mission.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;But&hellip;but I failed it.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;No, you didn&rsquo;t! Kid, Ophelius is still outside. Now go get &lsquo;im while we cuff these bastards,&rdquo; Sam ushered.</p><p><br/></p><p>Y/N looked at them all, before she nodded. Throwing off her heeled shoes, she took off after him. She could see him still struggled to leave through the exit, but the rushing people were preventing him of doing so. He started shoving them out of the way and looking frantically over his shoulder, seeing Y/N and trying to leave even harsher. </p><p><br/></p><p>Y/N moved and ducked down before she threw her leg out and made him stumble to the ground in pain. Using the upper hand, she leaned down and snatched the gun from his hand, but he just jerked his elbow right into her nose, sending her tumbling to the ground with blood spurting from her new wound. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Agh! Damn it!&rdquo; she cried, holding it. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move,&rdquo; he grumbled, slowly getting to his feet with both his and now her gun pointed at her. Y/N looked up in surprise, holding her hands up in defense. &ldquo;Time&rsquo;s up, Stark girl.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>Y/N felt as though her heart were leaving her ribcage. This was it. This was her final mission. Not only did she fail doing it and had to have her family rescue her, but she was going to die. She glanced over Ophelius&rsquo; shoulder and bit her lip. Nodding slowly, she met his eyes once more. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Fine&hellip;okay. You have me. Just&hellip;make it quick?&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; he chuckled, moving each of his fingers to pull the trigger. He cried out a moment later when Steve&rsquo;s shield hit him in the back of his neck. Y/N moved just in time before the bullets or the shield caught her since he shot by accident. Grabbing the shield on its return like a frisbee, she tripped Ophelius again and held him down with the shield to his throat. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try this again,&rdquo; she grunted, glaring down at him. &ldquo;By order of SHIELD, Ophelius&hellip;you are now under arrest. Welcome to our custody, asshole.&rdquo; Y/N smirked, enjoying the sight of defeat on his face. She waited for Natasha to contact their people, before she finally let up and allowed him to get to his feet. SHIELD had arrived and took him, Elise, Warner, and Briggs. The ball was officially empty, leaving Y/N and the others inside. She edged herself exhaustingly into a seat, rubbing her temples. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;You did it,&rdquo; Natasha congratulated, hugging her around the shoulders.</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Y/N sighed, gently pushing her away. &ldquo;If it weren&rsquo;t for you guys, I would&rsquo;ve lost.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>The others stood before her, either looking guilty or confused. Her father looked at Natasha for help, but even she was at a loss for words.</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Hey&hellip;even the best heroes need help sometimes, kiddo,&rdquo; Steve said finally. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not just Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow, or even Hawkeye. We&rsquo;re the Avengers for a reason.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;But this wasn&rsquo;t a mission necessary for the Avengers. I was supposed to take him out myself. Him and the others. And I blew it,&rdquo; Y/N clapped her hands to her face, blocking her eyes. &ldquo;Even after all that training&hellip;the other missions&hellip;I&rsquo;m still the stupid damsel in distress.&rdquo; </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Y/N-&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to make me feel better. I know I&rsquo;m right,&rdquo; Y/N murmured sadly.</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Are you kidding me? I&rsquo;ve never been more proud of you,&rdquo; Tony chuckled. &ldquo;I was able to see my daughter kick major ass. Don&rsquo;t tell me you didn&rsquo;t have fun fighting with us. Kind of like&hellip;like you&rsquo;re a part of the team.&rdquo; </p><p><br/></p><p>Y/N slowly looked up at him. &ldquo;Dad&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Y/N Stark, an Avenger? Nobody would stand a chance,&rdquo; Bucky grinned, adding to the thought. &ldquo;To be honest, I think we&rsquo;d all be better of working together. It&rsquo;s definitely a lot more fun than taking on a villain on our own.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>Y/N snorted softly, wiping a few stray tears away. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Me, an Avenger? Mm&hellip;that doesn&rsquo;t sound&hellip;terrible,&rdquo; Y/N was telling the truth. It had always been a distant dream of hers to become an Avenger. Fighting alongside her father and her family sounded like a blast.

Thank you so much for requesting this! It was a lot of fun to make! I did make it a little different, but I promise it has all the fluff you want in the end! I really hope you enjoy! Keep the requests coming!</i></p><p><b>Pairing(s)</b>: <i>Tony Stark x Daughter!Reader, Avengers x Reader</i></p><p>The violins synchronized beautifully, people either dancing to the slow music or walking around to admire the scenery. The ball was in full swing, Y/N amongst them in a long golden gown that shimmered every time she walked underneath the beautifully crafted chandelier. She looked absolutely beautiful, but if one looked closer, they\u2019d see an earpiece pressed in her right ear, voices from the heroes as well as her father pooling in and giving her directions. This wasn\u2019t her first undercover mission, but this was the first time it was more than just Natasha giving her instructions. That was back before her father even knew Nick recruited his daughter for things like this. When he initially found out, he was absolutely furious. But she was good at her job. His only conditions was he had to be present during the missions, able to watch with the hidden cameras. The one she wore now was in disguise on her diamond necklace. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThis place is a shithole,\u201d Clint commented idly. \u201cThe music, too. Who even goes to things like this and has a genuine good time?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cRich snobs. Sorry, Tony,\u201d Sam snorted. Steve had decided to come with Bucky and Sam. Since Bucky got better at Wakanda, Steve had a habit of bringing the two of them everywhere. It was like he was trying to spend as much time with him as he could. \u201cY/N, while you\u2019re there, can you snag me some of the shrimp in your purse? That\u2019s probably the only good shit there.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Bucky agreed. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAll of you shut up! Y/N, keep your eyes on the prize. Remember, his name\u2019s Ophelius Palmer. Bigger guy. Hides in plain sight. You remember his appearance?\u201d Natasha asked, allowing Y/N to hear her type away on the keyboard available to her. Y/N only wished she was here with her on this mission. But they needed Ophelius to find their undercover man instead of vice versa. Y/N Stark had the better name, unfortunately, due to her money supply and father. \u201cGuest list says he arrived after you. He should be somewhere around there.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this,\u201d Tony said. \u201cI don\u2019t like this at all.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cDad, I\u2019ve done this before,\u201d Y/N whispered, trying not to draw attention to herself as she took a glass of champagne off of one of the trays a woman was walking around with. She walked around, weaving through the people as she looked around. He had to be here somewhere, but she understood she had to be as subtle as possible. If Ophelius saw her looking for him, the plan would be ruined. He was paranoid as is. </p><p><br></p><p>Ophelius was a notorious mob boss with a knack for killing off his allies in an attempt to keep his reputation superior. Yet people still wanted to work with him; they probably figured they\u2019d get a piece of the cash load he had. This ball had something he wanted: Y/N Stark. What better way to catch him than to throw the bait? Tony had originally pleaded not to have her go out there, but this was the perfect opportunity. Besides, Y/N could handle herself just fine. She\u2019s trained with Natasha for several months now. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t we just march in there and grab him?\u201d Tony asked. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat would be your reaction if you saw someone coming after you?\u201d Bruce asked coolly. </p><p><br></p><p>Y/N could hear her father huff in annoyance. Y/N knew the answer. If Ophelius saw Earth\u2019s mightiest heroes marching in to get him, he could just pull out a gun and attack everyone inside to prevent his capture. Of course, she knew Tony wouldn\u2019t do that if he was being taken. He would, however, do everything else to ensure his escape.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThere he is,\u201d Y/N whispered, her eyes widening as she saw him enter the room, tailed by two sharply dressed men and one scantily clad woman hanging off his arm. His three better lackies. They could fight like nobody\u2019s business. They were pretty handy with guns, too. In fact, Y/N was willing to bet they were carrying right now. \u201cI just need him to see me.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d Natasha and Tony said simultaneously.</p><p><br></p><p>Y/N nodded, despite knowing they probably couldn\u2019t see her. She sipped at the champagne she was holding, slowly walking so she was in his line of sight. She tossed her hair over her shoulder, glancing here and there as if she were bored by the party itself and wanted better company. She held her breath. This had to work; if it didn\u2019t, so many people could get hurt. However, her prayers seemed to be answered quicker than not seeing as she suddenly saw him descending down the grand staircase in her direction. She tried to appear as if she didn\u2019t notice him, finding a small statue particularly interesting. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMiss Stark, I presume?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>She turned, flinching in automatic surprise. He was a lot bigger up close. Nevertheless, she politely stuck her hand out for him to shake. Instead of doing so, he took it up to his mouth to kiss. Y/N could hear Steve, her father, and Bucky mumbling incoherent threats in her earpiece for Ophelius simply touching her.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou know me?\u201d she asked. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWho doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not much of a celebrity in India. Although\u2026my father has his name written in big letters there. Perhaps the Stark name can only turn a few heads here and in London,\u201d Y/N smiled, sipping at her drink and glancing at the woman still hugging on Ophelius as if he were some kind of lifeline. She was staring at Y/N as if she were some kind of monster in plain sight. She could tell there was envy in her eyes as Ophelius kept his attention on her. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat brings you to the ball, then?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cCuriosity, mostly, but I also heard about the open bar. Someone like me tends to get stuff for free,\u201d Y/N really hated herself right now. She hated talking this way. It was so obnoxious and not necessary. But if it would convince Ophelius and his people, she would continue doing it. \u201cHowever, I\u2019ve yet to find someone worth talking to.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking to me.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYes, exactly.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Ophelius smiled, flattered. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cDid your father decide to skip the opportunity?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Y/N slowly nodded. \u201cHe had business in Washington. Otherwise he\u2019d be here cracking skulls and drinking about a half more than I am.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t drink that much!\u201d Tony exclaimed angrily. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAre you sure he is in Washington?\u201d Ophelius asked, confused. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYes, he is. Being Iron Man tends to make you move where the foot traffic is for danger.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOkay, just checking. Go ahead, Elise.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>The woman on his arm smirked, quickly sliding from him and wrapping an arm tightly around Y/N\u2019s waist. She felt the faint point of a knife at her spine, knowing exactly what was going on. She continued to smile, however, grinning happily up at Ophelius as if nothing were wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t wanna do this,\u201d Y/N sang softly. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cDo what? Y/N, talk to me. What\u2019s going on?\u201d Natasha asked, obviously unaware of the knife at Y/N\u2019s back.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOh, I do. If your father really is far from here, it gives me the opportunity to move you out as fast as I can. Make one move, Elise can paralyze you from the legs down,\u201d Ophelius explained, instantly telling the heroes exactly what was going on, but Y/N didn\u2019t hear a voice tell her to run or not to worry or anything. It was complete silence, but she couldn\u2019t focus on that. She had to focus on winning this mission, no matter what. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m warning you now, don\u2019t do this,\u201d Y/N said. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. Warner! Briggs! Go bring the car around. Send Turner in for a the jet. We\u2019re leaving tonight,\u201d Ophelius turned his back, giving Y/N the perfect opportunity. Jerking her head back, she sent it straight into Elise\u2019s nose. The girl yelped and jerked away, Y/N ripping the knife from her hands and going to jab it right into Ophelius\u2019 shoulder blade, but he wasn\u2019t in charge for nothing. He expected the attack.</p><p><br></p><p>Swinging around, he gripped her wrist. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSo now we\u2019re making this everyone else\u2019s business, hm?\u201d he asked tauntingly. This made her aware that the music had stopped; people were watching them in shock. \u201cJust because you learned a few tricks doesn\u2019t mean you get to suddenly step into the shoes of a heroine, doll. You ain\u2019t shit.\u201d He twisted her wrist enough for her to drop the knife, before he pulled his hands from his coat pocket and protruded a gun. Y/N didn\u2019t have time to think. Just as she heard the gunshot, she ducked away, readying herself for the pain. But it never came. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSteve?\u201d she exclaimed, surprised to see him standing right before her, clutching his shield despite not being suited up. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cGet out of here, now!\u201d he urged, standing straight and throwing his shield expertly at Ophelius, who merely ducked and had it graze his shiny, bald head. As Y/N looked around, she could see all of them had arrived, either suited up or just clutching the weapons they needed. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI have reinforcements, too,\u201d she smirked to Ophelius, moving around Steve and taking off after him. He took off in the opposite direction, being surprisingly fast. Warner and Briggs moved protectively in front of their boss, both clutching their own guns. They looked similar to the class mafia guns Y/N saw in old cartoons. It was like they were working for Al Capone. She moved her hand to the bottom of her dress, retrieving her own weapon that was strapped to her leg. Natasha had taught her the perfect way to stash weapons. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cPut them down and stand aside by order of SHIELD,\u201d she demanded angrily, aiming. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cTwo to one, sweetheart. No way you can get outta this,\u201d Briggs chuckled. However, his happiness was short lived. Thor proved to be an excellent tackler, sending him to the ground with ease with a shoulder to his mouth. Warner turned his gun to him instead, but Y/N whipped around, hitting him hard against the head with the bottom of her gun and knocking him out. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWell done, Lady Y/N!\u201d Thor exclaimed happily, raising a hand for her to high five. By now, the guests were all rushing toward the exits, fearful of anymore gunshots from them. Y/N could see now everyone was standing around her, Natasha holding Elise tightly in a hold.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWell\u2026what are you waiting for?\u201d she asked breathlessly. \u201cGo get Ophelius. Finish your mission.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBut\u2026but I failed it.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t! Kid, Ophelius is still outside. Now go get \u2018im while we cuff these bastards,\u201d Sam ushered.</p><p><br></p><p>Y/N looked at them all, before she nodded. Throwing off her heeled shoes, she took off after him. She could see him still struggled to leave through the exit, but the rushing people were preventing him of doing so. He started shoving them out of the way and looking frantically over his shoulder, seeing Y/N and trying to leave even harsher. </p><p><br></p><p>Y/N moved and ducked down before she threw her leg out and made him stumble to the ground in pain. Using the upper hand, she leaned down and snatched the gun from his hand, but he just jerked his elbow right into her nose, sending her tumbling to the ground with blood spurting from her new wound. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAgh! Damn it!\u201d she cried, holding it. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d he grumbled, slowly getting to his feet with both his and now her gun pointed at her. Y/N looked up in surprise, holding her hands up in defense. \u201cTime\u2019s up, Stark girl.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Y/N felt as though her heart were leaving her ribcage. This was it. This was her final mission. Not only did she fail doing it and had to have her family rescue her, but she was going to die. She glanced over Ophelius\u2019 shoulder and bit her lip. Nodding slowly, she met his eyes once more. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cFine\u2026okay. You have me. Just\u2026make it quick?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBy all means,\u201d he chuckled, moving each of his fingers to pull the trigger. He cried out a moment later when Steve\u2019s shield hit him in the back of his neck. Y/N moved just in time before the bullets or the shield caught her since he shot by accident. Grabbing the shield on its return like a frisbee, she tripped Ophelius again and held him down with the shield to his throat. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try this again,\u201d she grunted, glaring down at him. \u201cBy order of SHIELD, Ophelius\u2026you are now under arrest. Welcome to our custody, asshole.\u201d Y/N smirked, enjoying the sight of defeat on his face. She waited for Natasha to contact their people, before she finally let up and allowed him to get to his feet. SHIELD had arrived and took him, Elise, Warner, and Briggs. The ball was officially empty, leaving Y/N and the others inside. She edged herself exhaustingly into a seat, rubbing her temples. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou did it,\u201d Natasha congratulated, hugging her around the shoulders.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d Y/N sighed, gently pushing her away. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for you guys, I would\u2019ve lost.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>The others stood before her, either looking guilty or confused. Her father looked at Natasha for help, but even she was at a loss for words.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHey\u2026even the best heroes need help sometimes, kiddo,\u201d Steve said finally. \u201cWe\u2019re not just Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow, or even Hawkeye. We\u2019re the Avengers for a reason.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBut this wasn\u2019t a mission necessary for the Avengers. I was supposed to take him out myself. Him and the others. And I blew it,\u201d Y/N clapped her hands to her face, blocking her eyes. \u201cEven after all that training\u2026the other missions\u2026I\u2019m still the stupid damsel in distress.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cY/N-\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to make me feel better. I know I\u2019m right,\u201d Y/N murmured sadly.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? I\u2019ve never been more proud of you,\u201d Tony chuckled. \u201cI was able to see my daughter kick major ass. Don\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t have fun fighting with us. Kind of like\u2026like you\u2019re a part of the team.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Y/N slowly looked up at him. \u201cDad\u2026\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cY/N Stark, an Avenger? Nobody would stand a chance,\u201d Bucky grinned, adding to the thought. \u201cTo be honest, I think we\u2019d all be better of working together. It\u2019s definitely a lot more fun than taking on a villain on our own.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Y/N snorted softly, wiping a few stray tears away. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMe, an Avenger? Mm\u2026that doesn\u2019t sound\u2026terrible,\u201d Y/N was telling the truth. It had always been a distant dream of hers to become an Avenger. Fighting alongside her father and her family sounded like a blast. Tonight may have not been a win for her, but fighting alongside Earth\u2019s mightiest heroes was one of the best experiences of her life. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOkay, now that everyone\u2019s happy, can you please let me take care of that broken nose?\u201d Bruce asked worriedly.</p></p>",

Of course, she knew Tony wouldn\u2019t do that if he was being taken. He would, however, do everything else to ensure his escape.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThere he is,\u201d Y/N whispered, her eyes widening as she saw him enter the room, tailed by two sharply dressed men and one scantily clad woman hanging off his arm. His three better lackies. They could fight like nobody\u2019s business. They were pretty handy with guns, too. In fact, Y/N was willing to bet they were carrying right now. \u201cI just need him to see me.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d Natasha and Tony said simultaneously.</p><p><br></p><p>Y/N nodded, despite knowing they probably couldn\u2019t see her. She sipped at the champagne she was holding, slowly walking so she was in his line of sight. She tossed her hair over her shoulder, glancing here and there as if she were bored by the party itself and wanted better company. She held her breath. This had to work; if it didn\u2019t, so many people could get hurt. However, her prayers seemed to be answered quicker than not seeing as she suddenly saw him descending down the grand staircase in her direction. She tried to appear as if she didn\u2019t notice him, finding a small statue particularly interesting. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMiss Stark, I presume?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>She turned, flinching in automatic surprise. He was a lot bigger up close. Nevertheless, she politely stuck her hand out for him to shake. Instead of doing so, he took it up to his mouth to kiss. Y/N could hear Steve, her father, and Bucky mumbling incoherent threats in her earpiece for Ophelius simply touching her.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou know me?\u201d she asked. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWho doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not much of a celebrity in India. Although\u2026my father has his name written in big letters there. Perhaps the Stark name can only turn a few heads here and in London,\u201d Y/N smiled, sipping at her drink and glancing at the woman still hugging on Ophelius as if he were some kind of lifeline. She was staring at Y/N as if she were some kind of monster in plain sight. She could tell there was envy in her eyes as Ophelius kept his attention on her. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat brings you to the ball, then?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cCuriosity, mostly, but I also heard about the open bar. Someone like me tends to get stuff for free,\u201d Y/N really hated herself right now. She hated talking this way. It was so obnoxious and not necessary. But if it would convince Ophelius and his people, she would continue doing it. \u201cHowever, I\u2019ve yet to find someone worth talking to.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking to me.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYes, exactly.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Ophelius smiled, flattered. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cDid your father decide to skip the opportunity?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Y/N slowly nodded. \u201cHe had business in Washington. Otherwise he\u2019d be here cracking skulls and drinking about a half more than I am.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t drink that much!\u201d Tony exclaimed angrily. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAre you sure he is in Washington?\u201d Ophelius asked, confused. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYes, he is. Being Iron Man tends to make you move where the foot traffic is for danger.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOkay, just checking. Go ahead, Elise.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>The woman on his arm smirked, quickly sliding from him and wrapping an arm tightly around Y/N\u2019s waist. She felt the faint point of a knife at her spine, knowing exactly what was going on. She continued to smile, however, grinning happily up at Ophelius as if nothing were wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t wanna do this,\u201d Y/N sang softly. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cDo what? Y/N, talk to me. What\u2019s going on?\u201d Natasha asked, obviously unaware of the knife at Y/N\u2019s back.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOh, I do. If your father really is far from here, it gives me the opportunity to move you out as fast as I can. Make one move, Elise can paralyze you from the legs down,\u201d Ophelius explained, instantly telling the heroes exactly what was going on, but Y/N didn\u2019t hear a voice tell her to run or not to worry or anything. It was complete silence, but she couldn\u2019t focus on that. She had to focus on winning this mission, no matter what. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m warning you now, don\u2019t do this,\u201d Y/N said. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. Warner! Briggs! Go bring the car around. Send Turner in for a the jet. We\u2019re leaving tonight,\u201d Ophelius turned his back, giving Y/N the perfect opportunity. Jerking her head back, she sent it straight into Elise\u2019s nose. The girl yelped and jerked away, Y/N ripping the knife from her hands and going to jab it right into Ophelius\u2019 shoulder blade, but he wasn\u2019t in charge for nothing. He expected the attack.</p><p><br></p><p>Swinging around, he gripped her wrist. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSo now we\u2019re making this everyone else\u2019s business, hm?\u201d he asked tauntingly. This made her aware that the music had stopped; people were watching them in shock. \u201cJust because you learned a few tricks doesn\u2019t mean you get to suddenly step into the shoes of a heroine, doll. You ain\u2019t shit.\u201d He twisted her wrist enough for her to drop the knife, before he pulled his hands from his coat pocket and protruded a gun. Y/N didn\u2019t have time to think. Just as she heard the gunshot, she ducked away, readying herself for the pain. But it never came. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSteve?\u201d she exclaimed, surprised to see him standing right before her, clutching his shield despite not being suited up. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cGet out of here, now!\u201d he urged, standing straight and throwing his shield expertly at Ophelius, who merely ducked and had it graze his shiny, bald head. As Y/N looked around, she could see all of them had arrived, either suited up or just clutching the weapons they needed. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI have reinforcements, too,\u201d she smirked to Ophelius, moving around Steve and taking off after him. He took off in the opposite direction, being surprisingly fast. Warner and Briggs moved protectively in front of their boss, both clutching their own guns. They looked similar to the class mafia guns Y/N saw in old cartoons. It was like they were working for Al Capone. She moved her hand to the bottom of her dress, retrieving her own weapon that was strapped to her leg. Natasha had taught her the perfect way to stash weapons. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cPut them down and stand aside by order of SHIELD,\u201d she demanded angrily, aiming. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cTwo to one, sweetheart. No way you can get outta this,\u201d Briggs chuckled. However, his happiness was short lived. Thor proved to be an excellent tackler, sending him to the ground with ease with a shoulder to his mouth. Warner turned his gun to him instead, but Y/N whipped around, hitting him hard against the head with the bottom of her gun and knocking him out. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWell done, Lady Y/N!\u201d Thor exclaimed happily, raising a hand for her to high five. By now, the guests were all rushing toward the exits, fearful of anymore gunshots from them. Y/N could see now everyone was standing around her, Natasha holding Elise tightly in a hold.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWell\u2026what are you waiting for?\u201d she asked breathlessly. \u201cGo get Ophelius. Finish your mission.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBut\u2026but I failed it.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t! Kid, Ophelius is still outside. Now go get \u2018im while we cuff these bastards,\u201d Sam ushered.</p><p><br></p><p>Y/N looked at them all, before she nodded. Throwing off her heeled shoes, she took off after him. She could see him still struggled to leave through the exit, but the rushing people were preventing him of doing so. He started shoving them out of the way and looking frantically over his shoulder, seeing Y/N and trying to leave even harsher. </p><p><br></p><p>Y/N moved and ducked down before she threw her leg out and made him stumble to the ground in pain. Using the upper hand, she leaned down and snatched the gun from his hand, but he just jerked his elbow right into her nose, sending her tumbling to the ground with blood spurting from her new wound. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAgh! Damn it!\u201d she cried, holding it. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d he grumbled, slowly getting to his feet with both his and now her gun pointed at her. Y/N looked up in surprise, holding her hands up in defense. \u201cTime\u2019s up, Stark girl.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Y/N felt as though her heart were leaving her ribcage. This was it. This was her final mission. Not only did she fail doing it and had to have her family rescue her, but she was going to die. She glanced over Ophelius\u2019 shoulder and bit her lip. Nodding slowly, she met his eyes once more. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cFine\u2026okay. You have me. Just\u2026make it quick?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBy all means,\u201d he chuckled, moving each of his fingers to pull the trigger. He cried out a moment later when Steve\u2019s shield hit him in the back of his neck. Y/N moved just in time before the bullets or the shield caught her since he shot by accident. Grabbing the shield on its return like a frisbee, she tripped Ophelius again and held him down with the shield to his throat. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try this again,\u201d she grunted, glaring down at him. \u201cBy order of SHIELD, Ophelius\u2026you are now under arrest. Welcome to our custody, asshole.\u201d Y/N smirked, enjoying the sight of defeat on his face. She waited for Natasha to contact their people, before she finally let up and allowed him to get to his feet. SHIELD had arrived and took him, Elise, Warner, and Briggs. The ball was officially empty, leaving Y/N and the others inside. She edged herself exhaustingly into a seat, rubbing her temples. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou did it,\u201d Natasha congratulated, hugging her around the shoulders.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d Y/N sighed, gently pushing her away. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for you guys, I would\u2019ve lost.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>The others stood before her, either looking guilty or confused. Her father looked at Natasha for help, but even she was at a loss for words.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHey\u2026even the best heroes need help sometimes, kiddo,\u201d Steve said finally. \u201cWe\u2019re not just Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow, or even Hawkeye. We\u2019re the Avengers for a reason.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBut this wasn\u2019t a mission necessary for the Avengers. I was supposed to take him out myself. Him and the others. And I blew it,\u201d Y/N clapped her hands to her face, blocking her eyes. \u201cEven after all that training\u2026the other missions\u2026I\u2019m still the stupid damsel in distress.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cY/N-\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to make me feel better. I know I\u2019m right,\u201d Y/N murmured sadly.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? I\u2019ve never been more proud of you,\u201d Tony chuckled. \u201cI was able to see my daughter kick major ass. Don\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t have fun fighting with us. Kind of like\u2026like you\u2019re a part of the team.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Y/N slowly looked up at him. \u201cDad\u2026\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cY/N Stark, an Avenger? Nobody would stand a chance,\u201d Bucky grinned, adding to the thought. \u201cTo be honest, I think we\u2019d all be better of working together. It\u2019s definitely a lot more fun than taking on a villain on our own.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Y/N snorted softly, wiping a few stray tears away. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMe, an Avenger? Mm\u2026that doesn\u2019t sound\u2026terrible,\u201d Y/N was telling the truth. It had always been a distant dream of hers to become an Avenger. Fighting alongside her father and her family sounded like a blast. Tonight may have not been a win for her, but fighting alongside Earth\u2019s mightiest heroes was one of the best experiences of her life. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOkay, now that everyone\u2019s happy, can you please let me take care of that broken nose?\u201d Bruce asked worriedly.</p></p>",

Thank you so much for requesting this! It was a lot of fun to make! I did make it a little different, but I promise it has all the fluff you want in the end! I really hope you enjoy! Keep the requests coming!</i></p><p><b>Pairing(s)</b>: <i>Tony Stark x Daughter!Reader, Avengers x Reader</i></p><p>The violins synchronized beautifully, people either dancing to the slow music or walking around to admire the scenery. The ball was in full swing, Y/N amongst them in a long golden gown that shimmered every time she walked underneath the beautifully crafted chandelier. She looked absolutely beautiful, but if one looked closer, they&rsquo;d see an earpiece pressed in her right ear, voices from the heroes as well as her father pooling in and giving her directions. This wasn&rsquo;t her first undercover mission, but this was the first time it was more than just Natasha giving her instructions. That was back before her father even knew Nick recruited his daughter for things like this. When he initially found out, he was absolutely furious. But she was good at her job. His only conditions was he had to be present during the missions, able to watch with the hidden cameras. The one she wore now was in disguise on her diamond necklace. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;This place is a shithole,&rdquo; Clint commented idly. &ldquo;The music, too. Who even goes to things like this and has a genuine good time?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Rich snobs. Sorry, Tony,&rdquo; Sam snorted. Steve had decided to come with Bucky and Sam. Since Bucky got better at Wakanda, Steve had a habit of bringing the two of them everywhere. It was like he was trying to spend as much time with him as he could. &ldquo;Y/N, while you&rsquo;re there, can you snag me some of the shrimp in your purse? That&rsquo;s probably the only good shit there.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Me, too,&rdquo; Bucky agreed. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;All of you shut up! Y/N, keep your eyes on the prize. Remember, his name&rsquo;s Ophelius Palmer. Bigger guy. Hides in plain sight. You remember his appearance?&rdquo; Natasha asked, allowing Y/N to hear her type away on the keyboard available to her. Y/N only wished she was here with her on this mission. But they needed Ophelius to find their undercover man instead of vice versa. Y/N Stark had the better name, unfortunately, due to her money supply and father. &ldquo;Guest list says he arrived after you. He should be somewhere around there.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this,&rdquo; Tony said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this at all.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Dad, I&rsquo;ve done this before,&rdquo; Y/N whispered, trying not to draw attention to herself as she took a glass of champagne off of one of the trays a woman was walking around with. She walked around, weaving through the people as she looked around. He had to be here somewhere, but she understood she had to be as subtle as possible. If Ophelius saw her looking for him, the plan would be ruined. He was paranoid as is. </p><p><br /></p><p>Ophelius was a notorious mob boss with a knack for killing off his allies in an attempt to keep his reputation superior. Yet people still wanted to work with him; they probably figured they&rsquo;d get a piece of the cash load he had. This ball had something he wanted: Y/N Stark. What better way to catch him than to throw the bait? Tony had originally pleaded not to have her go out there, but this was the perfect opportunity. Besides, Y/N could handle herself just fine. She&rsquo;s trained with Natasha for several months now. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we just march in there and grab him?&rdquo; Tony asked. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;What would be your reaction if you saw someone coming after you?&rdquo; Bruce asked coolly. </p><p><br /></p><p>Y/N could hear her father huff in annoyance. Y/N knew the answer. If Ophelius saw Earth&rsquo;s mightiest heroes marching in to get him, he could just pull out a gun and attack everyone inside to prevent his capture. Of course, she knew Tony wouldn&rsquo;t do that if he was being taken. He would, however, do everything else to ensure his escape.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;There he is,&rdquo; Y/N whispered, her eyes widening as she saw him enter the room, tailed by two sharply dressed men and one scantily clad woman hanging off his arm.

Finish your mission.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;But&hellip;but I failed it.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, you didn&rsquo;t! Kid, Ophelius is still outside. Now go get &lsquo;im while we cuff these bastards,&rdquo; Sam ushered.</p><p><br /></p><p>Y/N looked at them all, before she nodded. Throwing off her heeled shoes, she took off after him.

Just&hellip;make it quick?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; he chuckled, moving each of his fingers to pull the trigger. He cried out a moment later when Steve&rsquo;s shield hit him in the back of his neck. Y/N moved just in time before the bullets or the shield caught her since he shot by accident. Grabbing the shield on its return like a frisbee, she tripped Ophelius again and held him down with the shield to his throat. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try this again,&rdquo; she grunted, glaring down at him. &ldquo;By order of SHIELD, Ophelius&hellip;you are now under arrest. Welcome to our custody, asshole.&rdquo; Y/N smirked, enjoying the sight of defeat on his face. She waited for Natasha to contact their people, before she finally let up and allowed him to get to his feet. SHIELD had arrived and took him, Elise, Warner, and Briggs. The ball was officially empty, leaving Y/N and the others inside. She edged herself exhaustingly into a seat, rubbing her temples. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You did it,&rdquo; Natasha congratulated, hugging her around the shoulders.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Y/N sighed, gently pushing her away. &ldquo;If it weren&rsquo;t for you guys, I would&rsquo;ve lost.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>The others stood before her, either looking guilty or confused. Her father looked at Natasha for help, but even she was at a loss for words.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey&hellip;even the best heroes need help sometimes, kiddo,&rdquo; Steve said finally. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not just Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow, or even Hawkeye. We&rsquo;re the Avengers for a reason.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;But this wasn&rsquo;t a mission necessary for the Avengers. I was supposed to take him out myself. Him and the others. And I blew it,&rdquo; Y/N clapped her hands to her face, blocking her eyes. &ldquo;Even after all that training&hellip;the other missions&hellip;I&rsquo;m still the stupid damsel in distress.&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Y/N-&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to make me feel better. I know I&rsquo;m right,&rdquo; Y/N murmured sadly.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Are you kidding me? I&rsquo;ve never been more proud of you,&rdquo; Tony chuckled. &ldquo;I was able to see my daughter kick major ass. Don&rsquo;t tell me you didn&rsquo;t have fun fighting with us. Kind of like&hellip;like you&rsquo;re a part of the team.&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>Y/N slowly looked up at him. &ldquo;Dad&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Y/N Stark, an Avenger? Nobody would stand a chance,&rdquo; Bucky grinned, adding to the thought. &ldquo;To be honest, I think we&rsquo;d all be better of working together. It&rsquo;s definitely a lot more fun than taking on a villain on our own.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Y/N snorted softly, wiping a few stray tears away. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Me, an Avenger? Mm&hellip;that doesn&rsquo;t sound&hellip;terrible,&rdquo; Y/N was telling the truth. It had always been a distant dream of hers to become an Avenger. Fighting alongside her father and her family sounded like a blast. Tonight may have not been a win for her, but fighting alongside Earth&rsquo;s mightiest heroes was one of the best experiences of her life. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay, now that everyone&rsquo;s happy, can you please let me take care of that broken nose?&rdquo; Bruce asked worriedly.</p></p>",
