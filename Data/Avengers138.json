But now that Peter is here,Steve and Tony both feel protective over him. It doesn\u2019t help that Peter hates everyone other than Steve and tony.

After being\nhappily together for three years, Tony struggled to understand what was wrong. </p><p>\u201cSteve?\u201d Tony asked suddenly and Steve jumped, then his\ngorgeous blue eyes met Tony\u2019s molten brown ones.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he asked softly, careful not to disturb Peter who\nwas sleeping soundly in his lap.</p><p>\u201cIs everything Alright?\u201d Tony asked and Steve nodded, a little\ntoo quickly.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine.\u201d Tony wanted to shout <i>Liar!</i> At Steve. But he merely forced\nhimself to smile. He had a stomach churning, gut wrenching, heart stopping fear\nthat one day, Steve would wake up and reAlise he\u2019d made the wrong decision to choose\nTony. All those years ago. Steve Always reassured Tony, but Tony couldn\u2019t shake\nthis feeling. EspeciAlly now that Steve seemed so distant. </p><p>\u201cAre <i>you</i> okay?\u201d Steve\nasked suddenly and Tony looked down at his hands.</p><p>\u201cI feel like you\u2019re hiding something from me.\u201d Tony forced\nhimself to look back up, Steve\u2019s eyebrows had risen. </p><p>\u201cHow do you Always know?\u201d Steve groaned and Tony was partiAlly\nrelieved, but his stomach began to twist and churn. He was relieved because he\nwasn\u2019t being paranoid and insecure and crazy, but terrified because secrets\nwere never a good thing.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Tony asked and Steve sighed.</p><p>\u201cSeven more hours, I just wanted seven more hours.\u201d Steve\nmuttered to himself.</p><p>\u201cSeven more hours?\u201d Tony asked and Steve sighed once more.</p><p>\u201cTonight we\u2019re going out for dinner, I was going to surprise\nyou and I got us a spot at this reAlly fancy restaurant and-\u201c</p><p>\u201c<i>Steve</i>.\u201d Tony\ngrinned, surprises were the only type of good secrets.</p><p>\u201cI mean I\u2019m happy to go to the diner if you can\u2019t be\nbothered with fancy restaurant food-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d Tony said cutting him off and Steve\u2019s breath\ncaught in his throat. No matter how many times Tony said it, it Always took Steve\u2019s\nbreath away. </p><p>\n\n\u201cI love you too Tony.\u201d Steve grinned and Tony\nsaw some of the anxiety that Steve had been harboring melt away. \n\n\n\n</p><hr><p>Steve couldn\u2019t stop shaking. Not as he got ready. Not in the\ncar. Not at the restaurant. The closer it got to go time, the more nauseous Steve\nfelt. It wasn\u2019t that Steve had any doubts about wanting to do what he wanted to\ndo, but whether <i>Tony </i>wanted to do it\nwas entirely different. Sitting across from him now, looking as gorgeous as\never. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on cap? You still seem nervous.\u201d Tony murmured\nand Steve knew this was his cue. His time to perform. Now or never. Because if Steve\ndidn\u2019t get over his nerves about doing this and facing possible rejection now,\nhe never would.</p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d Steve couldn\u2019t help himself, he took Tony\u2019s hand\njust for the physical reassurance. \u201cTonight isn\u2019t just any date night.\u201d God, Steve\nhad practiced this speech in his head at least a thousand times.</p><p>\u201cit\u2019s not?\u201d Tony asked with a slight frown.</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t.\u201d Steve took a deep breath, ready to spill the\nwords but Tony beat him to the punch.</p><p>\u201cIs it our anniversary? Because Fury\u2019s just been working me really\nhard and I\u2019m <i>so </i>sorry if I forgot and\nI promise I have a good way to make it up to you-\u201c Tony stopped talking when he\nsaw Steve had risen one of his brows.</p><p>\u201cLook I know when we first met we barely got along on a good\nday. And I know we\u2019ve both said terrible things about one another in the past.\nBut then we got our little miracle and you and Peter changed my entire world.\nSuddenly nothing else seemed important unless the two of you were safe.\u201d Steve\ncouldn\u2019t help but smile, suddenly feeling more confident.</p><p>\u201cI remember you aimlessly wondering supermarkets Steve.\u201d Tony\nmurmured dryly and Steve chuckled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been three years and the only thing that\u2019s changed\nsince now and then is that I love you now more than ever. And ill love you even\nmore tomorrow. Because I love you and I choose to spend the rest of my life,\nwith you.\u201d At that, Steve then got down on one knee and saw Tony\u2019s eyes\nwidened.</p><p>\u201cSteve\u2026\u201d but he trailed off, unable to finish the sentence.</p><p>\u201cWould you do me the honour of being my husband and being\nknown as <i>Tony Stark Rogers</i>?\u201d Steve\nasked and Tony merely stared with wide eyes. Steve\u2019s suit suddenly felt too\ntight and he could feel everyone around him staring, watching, waiting. <i>He\u2019s going to say no</i>. Steve could feel\nit, his hands began trembling and the knowledge that he may have screwed everything\nup crashed into him. </p><p>\u201cSteve\u2026\u201d but he trailed off, unable to finish the sentence. Steve\nwanted to rewind the last two minutes, because he wasn\u2019t sure he could face\nthis rejection. Not from Tony.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Steve couldn\u2019t hide the disappointment in his voice.\nHe wanted to be able to call Tony his husband, to know that it really was till\ndeath do they part. He began to put the box with the ring back in his pocket\nwhen Tony took his hand.</p><p>\u201cI love you, I want to marry you, but\u2026\u201d Tony was grinning\nand Steve could feel a smile tug at his lips. <i>I want to marry you</i>. There was hope, despite the but, hope flared\nin Steve\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d Steve asked and could practically feel everyone\naround them was hanging on by the edge of their seats, desperately wanting to\nsee what would happen next. And then Tony pulled out a box out of his own\npocket.</p><p>\u201cI bought this after our talk this morning.\u201d Steve watched\nas Tony opened the box to show a simple silver ring.</p><p>\u201cYou were going to propose?\u201d Steve asked and Tony nodded.</p><p>\u201cI guess great minds think alike.\u201d Tony chuckled and Steve\nfelt a wave of relief crash into him.</p><p>\u201cSo is that a yes?\u201d he asked and Tony nodded his head.</p><p>\n\n\u201cYes, I want to marry you.\u201d Steve stood up and\nkissed Tony, engaged at last.</p><hr><p>By the time they got home it was everywhere. Captain America\nand Iron Man were finally, at long last, engaged. Tony still couldn\u2019t believe\nit, he couldn\u2019t help but grin every time he looked down at his hand. He was\ngoing to marry Steve, they were going to be <i>husbands</i>.\nHe thought back to three years ago, when he had been pining for Steve. How\ntorturous it had been to make lasagne with Steve and to have not kissed him. In\nthe end, Steve had kissed Tony, Steve had proposed to Tony. It was Steve All Along.\nChoosing Tony, over and over and over again. Despite All the odds. </p><p>\u201cFury wants to know what\u2019s going on.\u201d Tony read his text\nmessage Aloud to Steve and Steve chuckled.</p><p>\u201cNatasha\u2019s mad I didn\u2019t tell her.\u201d Tony couldn\u2019t help but\nsmile. </p><p>\u201cDid you tell anyone?\u201d Tony asked and Steve nodded.</p><p>\u201cI went to Bucky.\u201d Tony inhaled sharply, but the ring on his\nfinger was a reminder that Steve had chosen him.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted Bucky to know that you were the one for me. I\nwanted him to truly understand that we weren\u2019t ever going to get back together.\nHe said he knew and that it was okay. Then he helped me pick out a ring.\u201d Well\nif Bucky was helping Steve pick out rings, he certainly wasn\u2019t planning on\ntrying to win Steve back. </p><p>\u201cThe media\u2019s going to enjoy this. They\u2019ll probably\nscrutinize over every little detail.\u201d Tony muttered and Steve smiled gently at\nhim.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to have a big public wedding.\u201d Seeing Steve\nsmile at him like that made the familiar warm and fuzzy feeling flood Tony\u2019s\nbody. Tony opened his mouth to respond when someone began to bang on their\napartment door. Tony opened it and saw Al standing there, Wade propped up on\nher hip.</p><p>\u201cHey Al.\u201d Tony smiled at the woman, but she looked furious. </p><p>\u201cWhy is it that I heard on the <i>news</i> that you two are engaged?\u201d she demanded and stormed passed Tony\ninto the apartment. Al was Always stopping by, after her husband had eventually\ndied two years ago, Steve and Tony had sort of taken in Al and Wade. Making\nsure to check in and hang out and support them whenever need be. On the plus\nside, Wade and Peter got Along very well. </p><p>\u201cBecause we got engaged.\u201d Steve announced with a wide grin\non his face. <i>Steve is my fianc\u00e9e. We\u2019re\ngetting married. He wants to be and is going to be my husband. </i>Tony\ncouldn\u2019t stop the giddy feelings from bubbling up within him. </p><p>\u201cCongratulations!\u201d Al hugged both of them and then put Wade\ndown. As soon as his feet hit the floor, he took off towards Peter\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cthanks Al.\u201d Steve was grinning and Tony found himself\ngrinning as well.</p><p>\u201cSo who proposed?\u201d She asked and Tony chuckled.</p><p>\u201cSteve did, but I was Also planning on proposing tonight.\u201d Tony\ntold her and Al laughed.</p><p>\u201cI swear you two were just made for one another.\u201d She\nmurmured with a wistful smile. Tony liked the idea of that. The idea of fate\nand destiny. If fate is what put Steve in the ice, preserving his body to wait\nuntil Tony was Alive, just to put the two of them together. Then Tony decided\nhe like the idea of it. </p><p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d Steve asked suddenly and Al shrugged.</p><p>\u201cSame old I guess, my eye sight has been a little spotty so I\u2019m\ngoing to go to the doctor on Monday.\u201d Al confessed and both Tony and Steve\nnodded their heads. </p><p>\u201cWell if you need anything we are just across the hall.\u201d Steve\nmurmured gently, stuffing his hands into his pockets. Tony leaned against the wall,\nAl and Wade were just as much a part of the family as May and the avengers\nwere. <i>May</i>. They hadn\u2019t told May yet,\nshe would be angrier than Al if she heard about their engagement from the news.\nAfter excusing himself, Tony pulled out his phone and called her.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d she answered as Tony walked into his and Steve\u2019s\nbedroom.</p><p>\u201cHey May.\u201d They would have to catch up soon, it had Almost\nbeen a month since they last saw her.</p><p>\u201cIs everything alright?\u201d she asked and Tony nodded before realising\nshe couldn\u2019t see him.</p><p>\u201cYeah I just have some news for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me it\u2019s good news, I don\u2019t think I could handle\nany more bad news today.\u201d Tony\u2019s stomach twisted and churned.</p><p>\u201cWhy? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d he heard her sigh and Tony began to\npace.</p><p>\u201cnothing, it\u2019s just been a long day. So tell me your news.\u201d Tony\nsuddenly felt guilty, like he was about to brag about how wonderful his life\nwas. May had lost her family and Tony had gained his because of that.</p><p>\u201cSteve and I are engaged.\u201d Tony said after a long moment. May\nwas very quiet for a long time.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s amazing. Congratulations.\u201d She murmured softly into\nthe phone. </p><p>\u201cI just thought I should let you know, it\u2019s All over the\nnews and-\u201c Tony suddenly felt very self-conscious. Maybe this was a bad idea, Maybe\nSteve should have done this.</p><p>\u201cThis is a good thing Tony. I\u2019m happy for you two.\u201d Tony sat\ndown on the bed and ran a hand through his hair. A moment later, Steve walked\nin the room.</p><p>\u201cEverything Alright?\u201d Steve asked and Tony nodded his head.</p><p>\u201cThanks May, would you like to talk to Steve?\u201d Tony asked\nand then handed over the phone. He watched as Steve paced back and forth, talking\nto May. Steve was smiling the way he does when he\u2019s trying to charm someone. Even\nthough May couldn\u2019t see it.</p><p>\u201cYes we\u2019ll have to catch up for dinner next Sunday, it was\ngood talking. Bye!\u201d he hung up the phone and handed it back to Tony.</p><p>\u201cIs it rude of us to talk about how happy we are?\u201d Tony\nasked and Steve shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI think it would be worse if we made a big deal out of it,\ndon\u2019t you?\u201d Tony decidedly nodded his head. Steve was right, of course he was, Steve\nwas <i>Always</i> right. At least when it\ncame to May he was. </p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Al?\u201d Tony asked as Steve sat down on the bed next\nto him.</p><p>\u201cShe went back across the hall to make her dinner. Wade and Peter\nare playing with Peter\u2019s cars.\u201d Tony nodded his head.</p><p>\u201cWe still need to formally talk to the other Avengers.\u201d Tony\nmurmured and Steve nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Natasha is the only one that knows.\u201d Tony\nnodded his head, Steve was probably right. </p><p>\u201cWe should do it soon. We could throw a party for them.\u201d Steve\nnodded and kissed Tony\u2019s temple.</p><p>\u201cI like the sound of that.\u201d Tony leaned his head on Steve\u2019s\nshoulder and Steve took Tony\u2019s hand. These were Tony\u2019s favorite moments, the\nquiet ones. Where he could sit and enjoy Steve\u2019s company, when neither of them\nwere stressed or worried. These were the moments where Tony knew for certain\nthat he and Steve could survive absolutely anything. </p>",

After being\nhappily together for three years, Tony struggled to understand what was wrong. </p><p>\u201cSteve?\u201d Tony asked suddenly and Steve jumped, then his\ngorgeous blue eyes met Tony\u2019s molten brown ones.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he asked softly, careful not to disturb Peter who\nwas sleeping soundly in his lap.</p><p>\u201cIs everything Alright?\u201d Tony asked and Steve nodded, a little\ntoo quickly.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine.\u201d Tony wanted to shout <i>Liar!</i> At Steve. But he merely forced\nhimself to smile. He had a stomach churning, gut wrenching, heart stopping fear\nthat one day, Steve would wake up and reAlise he\u2019d made the wrong decision to choose\nTony. All those years ago. Steve Always reassured Tony, but Tony couldn\u2019t shake\nthis feeling. EspeciAlly now that Steve seemed so distant. </p><p>\u201cAre <i>you</i> okay?\u201d Steve\nasked suddenly and Tony looked down at his hands.</p><p>\u201cI feel like you\u2019re hiding something from me.\u201d Tony forced\nhimself to look back up, Steve\u2019s eyebrows had risen. </p><p>\u201cHow do you Always know?\u201d Steve groaned and Tony was partiAlly\nrelieved, but his stomach began to twist and churn. He was relieved because he\nwasn\u2019t being paranoid and insecure and crazy, but terrified because secrets\nwere never a good thing.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Tony asked and Steve sighed.</p><p>\u201cSeven more hours, I just wanted seven more hours.\u201d Steve\nmuttered to himself.</p><p>\u201cSeven more hours?\u201d Tony asked and Steve sighed once more.</p><p>\u201cTonight we\u2019re going out for dinner, I was going to surprise\nyou and I got us a spot at this reAlly fancy restaurant and-\u201c</p><p>\u201c<i>Steve</i>.\u201d Tony\ngrinned, surprises were the only type of good secrets.</p><p>\u201cI mean I\u2019m happy to go to the diner if you can\u2019t be\nbothered with fancy restaurant food-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d Tony said cutting him off and Steve\u2019s breath\ncaught in his throat. No matter how many times Tony said it, it Always took Steve\u2019s\nbreath away. </p><p>\n\n\u201cI love you too Tony.\u201d Steve grinned and Tony\nsaw some of the anxiety that Steve had been harboring melt away. \n\n\n\n</p><hr><p>Steve couldn\u2019t stop shaking. Not as he got ready. Not in the\ncar. Not at the restaurant. The closer it got to go time, the more nauseous Steve\nfelt. It wasn\u2019t that Steve had any doubts about wanting to do what he wanted to\ndo, but whether <i>Tony </i>wanted to do it\nwas entirely different. Sitting across from him now, looking as gorgeous as\never. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on cap? You still seem nervous.\u201d Tony murmured\nand Steve knew this was his cue. His time to perform. Now or never. Because if Steve\ndidn\u2019t get over his nerves about doing this and facing possible rejection now,\nhe never would.</p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d Steve couldn\u2019t help himself, he took Tony\u2019s hand\njust for the physical reassurance. \u201cTonight isn\u2019t just any date night.\u201d God, Steve\nhad practiced this speech in his head at least a thousand times.</p><p>\u201cit\u2019s not?\u201d Tony asked with a slight frown.</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t.\u201d Steve took a deep breath, ready to spill the\nwords but Tony beat him to the punch.</p><p>\u201cIs it our anniversary? Because Fury\u2019s just been working me really\nhard and I\u2019m <i>so </i>sorry if I forgot and\nI promise I have a good way to make it up to you-\u201c Tony stopped talking when he\nsaw Steve had risen one of his brows.</p><p>\u201cLook I know when we first met we barely got along on a good\nday. And I know we\u2019ve both said terrible things about one another in the past.\nBut then we got our little miracle and you and Peter changed my entire world.\nSuddenly nothing else seemed important unless the two of you were safe.\u201d Steve\ncouldn\u2019t help but smile, suddenly feeling more confident.</p><p>\u201cI remember you aimlessly wondering supermarkets Steve.\u201d Tony\nmurmured dryly and Steve chuckled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been three years and the only thing that\u2019s changed\nsince now and then is that I love you now more than ever. And ill love you even\nmore tomorrow. Because I love you and I choose to spend the rest of my life,\nwith you.\u201d At that, Steve then got down on one knee and saw Tony\u2019s eyes\nwidened.</p><p>\u201cSteve\u2026\u201d but he trailed off, unable to finish the sentence.</p><p>\u201cWould you do me the honour of being my husband and being\nknown as <i>Tony Stark Rogers</i>?\u201d Steve\nasked and Tony merely stared with wide eyes. Steve\u2019s suit suddenly felt too\ntight and he could feel everyone around him staring, watching, waiting. <i>He\u2019s going to say no</i>. Steve could feel\nit, his hands began trembling and the knowledge that he may have screwed everything\nup crashed into him. </p><p>\u201cSteve\u2026\u201d but he trailed off, unable to finish the sentence. Steve\nwanted to rewind the last two minutes, because he wasn\u2019t sure he could face\nthis rejection. Not from Tony.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Steve couldn\u2019t hide the disappointment in his voice.\nHe wanted to be able to call Tony his husband, to know that it really was till\ndeath do they part. He began to put the box with the ring back in his pocket\nwhen Tony took his hand.</p><p>\u201cI love you, I want to marry you, but\u2026\u201d Tony was grinning\nand Steve could feel a smile tug at his lips. <i>I want to marry you</i>. There was hope, despite the but, hope flared\nin Steve\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d Steve asked and could practically feel everyone\naround them was hanging on by the edge of their seats, desperately wanting to\nsee what would happen next. And then Tony pulled out a box out of his own\npocket.</p><p>\u201cI bought this after our talk this morning.\u201d Steve watched\nas Tony opened the box to show a simple silver ring.</p><p>\u201cYou were going to propose?\u201d Steve asked and Tony nodded.</p><p>\u201cI guess great minds think alike.\u201d Tony chuckled and Steve\nfelt a wave of relief crash into him.</p><p>\u201cSo is that a yes?\u201d he asked and Tony nodded his head.</p><p>\n\n\u201cYes, I want to marry you.\u201d Steve stood up and\nkissed Tony, engaged at last.</p><hr><p>By the time they got home it was everywhere. Captain America\nand Iron Man were finally, at long last, engaged. Tony still couldn\u2019t believe\nit, he couldn\u2019t help but grin every time he looked down at his hand. He was\ngoing to marry Steve, they were going to be <i>husbands</i>.\nHe thought back to three years ago, when he had been pining for Steve. How\ntorturous it had been to make lasagne with Steve and to have not kissed him. In\nthe end, Steve had kissed Tony, Steve had proposed to Tony. It was Steve All Along.\nChoosing Tony, over and over and over again. Despite All the odds. </p><p>\u201cFury wants to know what\u2019s going on.\u201d Tony read his text\nmessage Aloud to Steve and Steve chuckled.</p><p>\u201cNatasha\u2019s mad I didn\u2019t tell her.\u201d Tony couldn\u2019t help but\nsmile. </p><p>\u201cDid you tell anyone?\u201d Tony asked and Steve nodded.</p><p>\u201cI went to Bucky.\u201d Tony inhaled sharply, but the ring on his\nfinger was a reminder that Steve had chosen him.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted Bucky to know that you were the one for me. I\nwanted him to truly understand that we weren\u2019t ever going to get back together.\nHe said he knew and that it was okay. Then he helped me pick out a ring.\u201d Well\nif Bucky was helping Steve pick out rings, he certainly wasn\u2019t planning on\ntrying to win Steve back. </p><p>\u201cThe media\u2019s going to enjoy this. They\u2019ll probably\nscrutinize over every little detail.\u201d Tony muttered and Steve smiled gently at\nhim.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to have a big public wedding.\u201d Seeing Steve\nsmile at him like that made the familiar warm and fuzzy feeling flood Tony\u2019s\nbody. Tony opened his mouth to respond when someone began to bang on their\napartment door. Tony opened it and saw Al standing there, Wade propped up on\nher hip.</p><p>\u201cHey Al.\u201d Tony smiled at the woman, but she looked furious. </p><p>\u201cWhy is it that I heard on the <i>news</i> that you two are engaged?\u201d she demanded and stormed passed Tony\ninto the apartment. Al was Always stopping by, after her husband had eventually\ndied two years ago, Steve and Tony had sort of taken in Al and Wade. Making\nsure to check in and hang out and support them whenever need be. On the plus\nside, Wade and Peter got Along very well. </p><p>\u201cBecause we got engaged.\u201d Steve announced with a wide grin\non his face. <i>Steve is my fianc\u00e9e. We\u2019re\ngetting married. He wants to be and is going to be my husband. </i>Tony\ncouldn\u2019t stop the giddy feelings from bubbling up within him. </p><p>\u201cCongratulations!\u201d Al hugged both of them and then put Wade\ndown. As soon as his feet hit the floor, he took off towards Peter\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cthanks Al.\u201d Steve was grinning and Tony found himself\ngrinning as well.</p><p>\u201cSo who proposed?\u201d She asked and Tony chuckled.</p><p>\u201cSteve did, but I was Also planning on proposing tonight.\u201d Tony\ntold her and Al laughed.</p><p>\u201cI swear you two were just made for one another.\u201d She\nmurmured with a wistful smile. Tony liked the idea of that. The idea of fate\nand destiny. If fate is what put Steve in the ice, preserving his body to wait\nuntil Tony was Alive, just to put the two of them together. Then Tony decided\nhe like the idea of it. </p><p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d Steve asked suddenly and Al shrugged.</p><p>\u201cSame old I guess, my eye sight has been a little spotty so I\u2019m\ngoing to go to the doctor on Monday.\u201d Al confessed and both Tony and Steve\nnodded their heads. </p><p>\u201cWell if you need anything we are just across the hall.\u201d Steve\nmurmured gently, stuffing his hands into his pockets. Tony leaned against the wall,\nAl and Wade were just as much a part of the family as May and the avengers\nwere. <i>May</i>. They hadn\u2019t told May yet,\nshe would be angrier than Al if she heard about their engagement from the news.\nAfter excusing himself, Tony pulled out his phone and called her.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d she answered as Tony walked into his and Steve\u2019s\nbedroom.</p><p>\u201cHey May.\u201d They would have to catch up soon, it had Almost\nbeen a month since they last saw her.</p><p>\u201cIs everything alright?\u201d she asked and Tony nodded before realising\nshe couldn\u2019t see him.</p><p>\u201cYeah I just have some news for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me it\u2019s good news, I don\u2019t think I could handle\nany more bad news today.\u201d Tony\u2019s stomach twisted and churned.</p><p>\u201cWhy? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d he heard her sigh and Tony began to\npace.</p><p>\u201cnothing, it\u2019s just been a long day. So tell me your news.\u201d Tony\nsuddenly felt guilty, like he was about to brag about how wonderful his life\nwas. May had lost her family and Tony had gained his because of that.</p><p>\u201cSteve and I are engaged.\u201d Tony said after a long moment. May\nwas very quiet for a long time.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s amazing. Congratulations.\u201d She murmured softly into\nthe phone. </p><p>\u201cI just thought I should let you know, it\u2019s All over the\nnews and-\u201c Tony suddenly felt very self-conscious. Maybe this was a bad idea, Maybe\nSteve should have done this.</p><p>\u201cThis is a good thing Tony. I\u2019m happy for you two.\u201d Tony sat\ndown on the bed and ran a hand through his hair. A moment later, Steve walked\nin the room.</p><p>\u201cEverything Alright?\u201d Steve asked and Tony nodded his head.</p><p>\u201cThanks May, would you like to talk to Steve?\u201d Tony asked\nand then handed over the phone. He watched as Steve paced back and forth, talking\nto May. Steve was smiling the way he does when he\u2019s trying to charm someone. Even\nthough May couldn\u2019t see it.</p><p>\u201cYes we\u2019ll have to catch up for dinner next Sunday, it was\ngood talking. Bye!\u201d he hung up the phone and handed it back to Tony.</p><p>\u201cIs it rude of us to talk about how happy we are?\u201d Tony\nasked and Steve shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI think it would be worse if we made a big deal out of it,\ndon\u2019t you?\u201d Tony decidedly nodded his head. Steve was right, of course he was, Steve\nwas <i>Always</i> right. At least when it\ncame to May he was. </p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Al?\u201d Tony asked as Steve sat down on the bed next\nto him.</p><p>\u201cShe went back across the hall to make her dinner. Wade and Peter\nare playing with Peter\u2019s cars.\u201d Tony nodded his head.</p><p>\u201cWe still need to formally talk to the other Avengers.\u201d Tony\nmurmured and Steve nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Natasha is the only one that knows.\u201d Tony\nnodded his head, Steve was probably right. </p><p>\u201cWe should do it soon. We could throw a party for them.\u201d Steve\nnodded and kissed Tony\u2019s temple.</p><p>\u201cI like the sound of that.\u201d Tony leaned his head on Steve\u2019s\nshoulder and Steve took Tony\u2019s hand. These were Tony\u2019s favorite moments, the\nquiet ones. Where he could sit and enjoy Steve\u2019s company, when neither of them\nwere stressed or worried. These were the moments where Tony knew for certain\nthat he and Steve could survive absolutely anything. </p>",

After being\nhappily together for three years, Tony struggled to understand what was wrong. </p><p>\u201cSteve?\u201d Tony asked suddenly and Steve jumped, then his\ngorgeous blue eyes met Tony\u2019s molten brown ones.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he asked softly, careful not to disturb Peter who\nwas sleeping soundly in his lap.</p><p>\u201cIs everything Alright?\u201d Tony asked and Steve nodded, a little\ntoo quickly.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine.\u201d Tony wanted to shout <i>Liar!</i> At Steve. But he merely forced\nhimself to smile. He had a stomach churning, gut wrenching, heart stopping fear\nthat one day, Steve would wake up and reAlise he\u2019d made the wrong decision to choose\nTony. All those years ago. Steve Always reassured Tony, but Tony couldn\u2019t shake\nthis feeling. EspeciAlly now that Steve seemed so distant. </p><p>\u201cAre <i>you</i> okay?\u201d Steve\nasked suddenly and Tony looked down at his hands.</p><p>\u201cI feel like you\u2019re hiding something from me.\u201d Tony forced\nhimself to look back up, Steve\u2019s eyebrows had risen. </p><p>\u201cHow do you Always know?\u201d Steve groaned and Tony was partiAlly\nrelieved, but his stomach began to twist and churn. He was relieved because he\nwasn\u2019t being paranoid and insecure and crazy, but terrified because secrets\nwere never a good thing.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Tony asked and Steve sighed.</p><p>\u201cSeven more hours, I just wanted seven more hours.\u201d Steve\nmuttered to himself.</p><p>\u201cSeven more hours?\u201d Tony asked and Steve sighed once more.</p><p>\u201cTonight we\u2019re going out for dinner, I was going to surprise\nyou and I got us a spot at this reAlly fancy restaurant and-\u201c</p><p>\u201c<i>Steve</i>.\u201d Tony\ngrinned, surprises were the only type of good secrets.</p><p>\u201cI mean I\u2019m happy to go to the diner if you can\u2019t be\nbothered with fancy restaurant food-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d Tony said cutting him off and Steve\u2019s breath\ncaught in his throat. No matter how many times Tony said it, it Always took Steve\u2019s\nbreath away. </p><p>\n\n\u201cI love you too Tony.\u201d Steve grinned and Tony\nsaw some of the anxiety that Steve had been harboring melt away. \n\n\n\n</p><hr><p>Steve couldn\u2019t stop shaking. Not as he got ready. Not in the\ncar. Not at the restaurant. The closer it got to go time, the more nauseous Steve\nfelt. It wasn\u2019t that Steve had any doubts about wanting to do what he wanted to\ndo, but whether <i>Tony </i>wanted to do it\nwas entirely different. Sitting across from him now, looking as gorgeous as\never. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on cap? You still seem nervous.\u201d Tony murmured\nand Steve knew this was his cue. His time to perform. Now or never. Because if Steve\ndidn\u2019t get over his nerves about doing this and facing possible rejection now,\nhe never would.</p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d Steve couldn\u2019t help himself, he took Tony\u2019s hand\njust for the physical reassurance. \u201cTonight isn\u2019t just any date night.\u201d God, Steve\nhad practiced this speech in his head at least a thousand times.</p><p>\u201cit\u2019s not?\u201d Tony asked with a slight frown.</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t.\u201d Steve took a deep breath, ready to spill the\nwords but Tony beat him to the punch.</p><p>\u201cIs it our anniversary? Because Fury\u2019s just been working me really\nhard and I\u2019m <i>so </i>sorry if I forgot and\nI promise I have a good way to make it up to you-\u201c Tony stopped talking when he\nsaw Steve had risen one of his brows.</p><p>\u201cLook I know when we first met we barely got along on a good\nday. And I know we\u2019ve both said terrible things about one another in the past.\nBut then we got our little miracle and you and Peter changed my entire world.\nSuddenly nothing else seemed important unless the two of you were safe.\u201d Steve\ncouldn\u2019t help but smile, suddenly feeling more confident.</p><p>\u201cI remember you aimlessly wondering supermarkets Steve.\u201d Tony\nmurmured dryly and Steve chuckled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been three years and the only thing that\u2019s changed\nsince now and then is that I love you now more than ever. And ill love you even\nmore tomorrow. Because I love you and I choose to spend the rest of my life,\nwith you.\u201d At that, Steve then got down on one knee and saw Tony\u2019s eyes\nwidened.</p><p>\u201cSteve\u2026\u201d but he trailed off, unable to finish the sentence.</p><p>\u201cWould you do me the honour of being my husband and being\nknown as <i>Tony Stark Rogers</i>?\u201d Steve\nasked and Tony merely stared with wide eyes. Steve\u2019s suit suddenly felt too\ntight and he could feel everyone around him staring, watching, waiting. <i>He\u2019s going to say no</i>. Steve could feel\nit, his hands began trembling and the knowledge that he may have screwed everything\nup crashed into him. </p><p>\u201cSteve\u2026\u201d but he trailed off, unable to finish the sentence. Steve\nwanted to rewind the last two minutes, because he wasn\u2019t sure he could face\nthis rejection. Not from Tony.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Steve couldn\u2019t hide the disappointment in his voice.\nHe wanted to be able to call Tony his husband, to know that it really was till\ndeath do they part. He began to put the box with the ring back in his pocket\nwhen Tony took his hand.</p><p>\u201cI love you, I want to marry you, but\u2026\u201d Tony was grinning\nand Steve could feel a smile tug at his lips. <i>I want to marry you</i>. There was hope, despite the but, hope flared\nin Steve\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d Steve asked and could practically feel everyone\naround them was hanging on by the edge of their seats, desperately wanting to\nsee what would happen next. And then Tony pulled out a box out of his own\npocket.</p><p>\u201cI bought this after our talk this morning.\u201d Steve watched\nas Tony opened the box to show a simple silver ring.</p><p>\u201cYou were going to propose?\u201d Steve asked and Tony nodded.</p><p>\u201cI guess great minds think alike.\u201d Tony chuckled and Steve\nfelt a wave of relief crash into him.</p><p>\u201cSo is that a yes?\u201d he asked and Tony nodded his head.</p><p>\n\n\u201cYes, I want to marry you.\u201d Steve stood up and\nkissed Tony, engaged at last.</p><hr><p>By the time they got home it was everywhere. Captain America\nand Iron Man were finally, at long last, engaged. Tony still couldn\u2019t believe\nit, he couldn\u2019t help but grin every time he looked down at his hand. He was\ngoing to marry Steve, they were going to be <i>husbands</i>.\nHe thought back to three years ago, when he had been pining for Steve. How\ntorturous it had been to make lasagne with Steve and to have not kissed him. In\nthe end, Steve had kissed Tony, Steve had proposed to Tony. It was Steve All Along.\nChoosing Tony, over and over and over again. Despite All the odds. </p><p>\u201cFury wants to know what\u2019s going on.\u201d Tony read his text\nmessage Aloud to Steve and Steve chuckled.</p><p>\u201cNatasha\u2019s mad I didn\u2019t tell her.\u201d Tony couldn\u2019t help but\nsmile. </p><p>\u201cDid you tell anyone?\u201d Tony asked and Steve nodded.</p><p>\u201cI went to Bucky.\u201d Tony inhaled sharply, but the ring on his\nfinger was a reminder that Steve had chosen him.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted Bucky to know that you were the one for me. I\nwanted him to truly understand that we weren\u2019t ever going to get back together.\nHe said he knew and that it was okay. Then he helped me pick out a ring.\u201d Well\nif Bucky was helping Steve pick out rings, he certainly wasn\u2019t planning on\ntrying to win Steve back. </p><p>\u201cThe media\u2019s going to enjoy this. They\u2019ll probably\nscrutinize over every little detail.\u201d Tony muttered and Steve smiled gently at\nhim.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to have a big public wedding.\u201d Seeing Steve\nsmile at him like that made the familiar warm and fuzzy feeling flood Tony\u2019s\nbody. Tony opened his mouth to respond when someone began to bang on their\napartment door. Tony opened it and saw Al standing there, Wade propped up on\nher hip.</p><p>\u201cHey Al.\u201d Tony smiled at the woman, but she looked furious. </p><p>\u201cWhy is it that I heard on the <i>news</i> that you two are engaged?\u201d she demanded and stormed passed Tony\ninto the apartment. Al was Always stopping by, after her husband had eventually\ndied two years ago, Steve and Tony had sort of taken in Al and Wade. Making\nsure to check in and hang out and support them whenever need be. On the plus\nside, Wade and Peter got Along very well. </p><p>\u201cBecause we got engaged.\u201d Steve announced with a wide grin\non his face. <i>Steve is my fianc\u00e9e. We\u2019re\ngetting married. He wants to be and is going to be my husband. </i>Tony\ncouldn\u2019t stop the giddy feelings from bubbling up within him. </p><p>\u201cCongratulations!\u201d Al hugged both of them and then put Wade\ndown. As soon as his feet hit the floor, he took off towards Peter\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cthanks Al.\u201d Steve was grinning and Tony found himself\ngrinning as well.</p><p>\u201cSo who proposed?\u201d She asked and Tony chuckled.</p><p>\u201cSteve did, but I was Also planning on proposing tonight.\u201d Tony\ntold her and Al laughed.</p><p>\u201cI swear you two were just made for one another.\u201d She\nmurmured with a wistful smile. Tony liked the idea of that. The idea of fate\nand destiny. If fate is what put Steve in the ice, preserving his body to wait\nuntil Tony was Alive, just to put the two of them together. Then Tony decided\nhe like the idea of it. </p><p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d Steve asked suddenly and Al shrugged.</p><p>\u201cSame old I guess, my eye sight has been a little spotty so I\u2019m\ngoing to go to the doctor on Monday.\u201d Al confessed and both Tony and Steve\nnodded their heads. </p><p>\u201cWell if you need anything we are just across the hall.\u201d Steve\nmurmured gently, stuffing his hands into his pockets. Tony leaned against the wall,\nAl and Wade were just as much a part of the family as May and the avengers\nwere. <i>May</i>. They hadn\u2019t told May yet,\nshe would be angrier than Al if she heard about their engagement from the news.\nAfter excusing himself, Tony pulled out his phone and called her.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d she answered as Tony walked into his and Steve\u2019s\nbedroom.</p><p>\u201cHey May.\u201d They would have to catch up soon, it had Almost\nbeen a month since they last saw her.</p><p>\u201cIs everything alright?\u201d she asked and Tony nodded before realising\nshe couldn\u2019t see him.</p><p>\u201cYeah I just have some news for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me it\u2019s good news, I don\u2019t think I could handle\nany more bad news today.\u201d Tony\u2019s stomach twisted and churned.</p><p>\u201cWhy? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d he heard her sigh and Tony began to\npace.</p><p>\u201cnothing, it\u2019s just been a long day. So tell me your news.\u201d Tony\nsuddenly felt guilty, like he was about to brag about how wonderful his life\nwas. May had lost her family and Tony had gained his because of that.</p><p>\u201cSteve and I are engaged.\u201d Tony said after a long moment. May\nwas very quiet for a long time.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s amazing. Congratulations.\u201d She murmured softly into\nthe phone. </p><p>\u201cI just thought I should let you know, it\u2019s All over the\nnews and-\u201c Tony suddenly felt very self-conscious. Maybe this was a bad idea, Maybe\nSteve should have done this.</p><p>\u201cThis is a good thing Tony. I\u2019m happy for you two.\u201d Tony sat\ndown on the bed and ran a hand through his hair. A moment later, Steve walked\nin the room.</p><p>\u201cEverything Alright?\u201d Steve asked and Tony nodded his head.</p><p>\u201cThanks May, would you like to talk to Steve?\u201d Tony asked\nand then handed over the phone. He watched as Steve paced back and forth, talking\nto May. Steve was smiling the way he does when he\u2019s trying to charm someone. Even\nthough May couldn\u2019t see it.</p><p>\u201cYes we\u2019ll have to catch up for dinner next Sunday, it was\ngood talking. Bye!\u201d he hung up the phone and handed it back to Tony.</p><p>\u201cIs it rude of us to talk about how happy we are?\u201d Tony\nasked and Steve shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI think it would be worse if we made a big deal out of it,\ndon\u2019t you?\u201d Tony decidedly nodded his head. Steve was right, of course he was, Steve\nwas <i>Always</i> right. At least when it\ncame to May he was. </p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Al?\u201d Tony asked as Steve sat down on the bed next\nto him.</p><p>\u201cShe went back across the hall to make her dinner. Wade and Peter\nare playing with Peter\u2019s cars.\u201d Tony nodded his head.</p><p>\u201cWe still need to formally talk to the other Avengers.\u201d Tony\nmurmured and Steve nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Natasha is the only one that knows.\u201d Tony\nnodded his head, Steve was probably right. </p><p>\u201cWe should do it soon. We could throw a party for them.\u201d Steve\nnodded and kissed Tony\u2019s temple.</p><p>\u201cI like the sound of that.\u201d Tony leaned his head on Steve\u2019s\nshoulder and Steve took Tony\u2019s hand. These were Tony\u2019s favorite moments, the\nquiet ones. Where he could sit and enjoy Steve\u2019s company, when neither of them\nwere stressed or worried. These were the moments where Tony knew for certain\nthat he and Steve could survive absolutely anything. </p>",

Steve could feel\nit, his hands began trembling and the knowledge that he may have screwed everything\nup crashed into him. </p><p>&ldquo;Steve&hellip;&rdquo; but he trailed off, unable to finish the sentence. Steve\nwanted to rewind the last two minutes, because he wasn&rsquo;t sure he could face\nthis rejection. Not from Tony.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip;&rdquo; Steve couldn&rsquo;t hide the disappointment in his voice.\nHe wanted to be able to call Tony his husband, to know that it really was till\ndeath do they part. He began to put the box with the ring back in his pocket\nwhen Tony took his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, I want to marry you, but&hellip;&rdquo; Tony was grinning\nand Steve could feel a smile tug at his lips. <i>I want to marry you</i>. There was hope, despite the but, hope flared\nin Steve&rsquo;s chest.</p><p>&ldquo;But?&rdquo; Steve asked and could practically feel everyone\naround them was hanging on by the edge of their seats, desperately wanting to\nsee what would happen next. And then Tony pulled out a box out of his own\npocket.</p><p>&ldquo;I bought this after our talk this morning.&rdquo; Steve watched\nas Tony opened the box to show a simple silver ring.</p><p>&ldquo;You were going to propose?&rdquo; Steve asked and Tony nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess great minds think alike.&rdquo; Tony chuckled and Steve\nfelt a wave of relief crash into him.</p><p>&ldquo;So is that a yes?&rdquo; he asked and Tony nodded his head.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Yes, I want to marry you.&rdquo; Steve stood up and\nkissed Tony, engaged at last.</p><hr /><p>By the time they got home it was everywhere. Captain America\nand Iron Man were finally, at long last, engaged. Tony still couldn&rsquo;t believe\nit, he couldn&rsquo;t help but grin every time he looked down at his hand. He was\ngoing to marry Steve, they were going to be <i>husbands</i>.\nHe thought back to three years ago, when he had been pining for Steve. How\ntorturous it had been to make lasagne with Steve and to have not kissed him. In\nthe end, Steve had kissed Tony, Steve had proposed to Tony. It was Steve All Along.\nChoosing Tony, over and over and over again. Despite All the odds. </p><p>&ldquo;Fury wants to know what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo; Tony read his text\nmessage Aloud to Steve and Steve chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;Natasha&rsquo;s mad I didn&rsquo;t tell her.&rdquo; Tony couldn&rsquo;t help but\nsmile. </p><p>&ldquo;Did you tell anyone?&rdquo; Tony asked and Steve nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;I went to Bucky.&rdquo; Tony inhaled sharply, but the ring on his\nfinger was a reminder that Steve had chosen him.</p><p>&ldquo;And?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wanted Bucky to know that you were the one for me. I\nwanted him to truly understand that we weren&rsquo;t ever going to get back together.\nHe said he knew and that it was okay. Then he helped me pick out a ring.&rdquo; Well\nif Bucky was helping Steve pick out rings, he certainly wasn&rsquo;t planning on\ntrying to win Steve back. </p><p>&ldquo;The media&rsquo;s going to enjoy this. They&rsquo;ll probably\nscrutinize over every little detail.&rdquo; Tony muttered and Steve smiled gently at\nhim.</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have to have a big public wedding.&rdquo; Seeing Steve\nsmile at him like that made the familiar warm and fuzzy feeling flood Tony&rsquo;s\nbody. Tony opened his mouth to respond when someone began to bang on their\napartment door. Tony opened it and saw Al standing there, Wade propped up on\nher hip.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Al.&rdquo; Tony smiled at the woman, but she looked furious. </p><p>&ldquo;Why is it that I heard on the <i>news</i> that you two are engaged?&rdquo; she demanded and stormed passed Tony\ninto the apartment. Al was Always stopping by, after her husband had eventually\ndied two years ago, Steve and Tony had sort of taken in Al and Wade. Making\nsure to check in and hang out and support them whenever need be. On the plus\nside, Wade and Peter got Along very well. </p><p>&ldquo;Because we got engaged.&rdquo; Steve announced with a wide grin\non his face. <i>Steve is my fianc&eacute;e. We&rsquo;re\ngetting married. He wants to be and is going to be my husband. </i>Tony\ncouldn&rsquo;t stop the giddy feelings from bubbling up within him. </p><p>&ldquo;Congratulations!&rdquo; Al hugged both of them and then put Wade\ndown. As soon as his feet hit the floor, he took off towards Peter&rsquo;s room.</p><p>&ldquo;thanks Al.&rdquo; Steve was grinning and Tony found himself\ngrinning as well.</p><p>&ldquo;So who proposed?&rdquo; She asked and Tony chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;Steve did, but I was Also planning on proposing tonight.&rdquo; Tony\ntold her and Al laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;I swear you two were just made for one another.&rdquo; She\nmurmured with a wistful smile. Tony liked the idea of that. The idea of fate\nand destiny. If fate is what put Steve in the ice, preserving his body to wait\nuntil Tony was Alive, just to put the two of them together. Then Tony decided\nhe like the idea of it. </p><p>&ldquo;How are you doing?&rdquo; Steve asked suddenly and Al shrugged.</p><p>&ldquo;Same old I guess, my eye sight has been a little spotty so I&rsquo;m\ngoing to go to the doctor on Monday.&rdquo; Al confessed and both Tony and Steve\nnodded their heads. </p><p>&ldquo;Well if you need anything we are just across the hall.&rdquo; Steve\nmurmured gently, stuffing his hands into his pockets. Tony leaned against the wall,\nAl and Wade were just as much a part of the family as May and the avengers\nwere. <i>May</i>. They hadn&rsquo;t told May yet,\nshe would be angrier than Al if she heard about their engagement from the news.\nAfter excusing himself, Tony pulled out his phone and called her.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; she answered as Tony walked into his and Steve&rsquo;s\nbedroom.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey May.&rdquo; They would have to catch up soon, it had Almost\nbeen a month since they last saw her.</p><p>&ldquo;Is everything alright?&rdquo; she asked and Tony nodded before realising\nshe couldn&rsquo;t see him.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah I just have some news for you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please tell me it&rsquo;s good news, I don&rsquo;t think I could handle\nany more bad news today.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s stomach twisted and churned.</p><p>&ldquo;Why? What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; he heard her sigh and Tony began to\npace.</p><p>&ldquo;nothing, it&rsquo;s just been a long day. So tell me your news.&rdquo; Tony\nsuddenly felt guilty, like he was about to brag about how wonderful his life\nwas. May had lost her family and Tony had gained his because of that.</p><p>&ldquo;Steve and I are engaged.&rdquo; Tony said after a long moment. May\nwas very quiet for a long time.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s amazing. Congratulations.&rdquo; She murmured softly into\nthe phone. </p><p>&ldquo;I just thought I should let you know, it&rsquo;s All over the\nnews and-&ldquo; Tony suddenly felt very self-conscious. Maybe this was a bad idea, Maybe\nSteve should have done this.</p><p>&ldquo;This is a good thing Tony. I&rsquo;m happy for you two.&rdquo; Tony sat\ndown on the bed and ran a hand through his hair. A moment later, Steve walked\nin the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Everything Alright?&rdquo; Steve asked and Tony nodded his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks May, would you like to talk to Steve?&rdquo; Tony asked\nand then handed over the phone. He watched as Steve paced back and forth, talking\nto May. Steve was smiling the way he does when he&rsquo;s trying to charm someone. Even\nthough May couldn&rsquo;t see it.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes we&rsquo;ll have to catch up for dinner next Sunday, it was\ngood talking. Bye!&rdquo; he hung up the phone and handed it back to Tony.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it rude of us to talk about how happy we are?&rdquo; Tony\nasked and Steve shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;I think it would be worse if we made a big deal out of it,\ndon&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Tony decidedly nodded his head. Steve was right, of course he was, Steve\nwas <i>Always</i> right. At least when it\ncame to May he was. </p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Al?&rdquo; Tony asked as Steve sat down on the bed next\nto him.</p><p>&ldquo;She went back across the hall to make her dinner. Wade and Peter\nare playing with Peter&rsquo;s cars.&rdquo; Tony nodded his head.</p><p>&ldquo;We still need to formally talk to the other Avengers.&rdquo; Tony\nmurmured and Steve nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure Natasha is the only one that knows.&rdquo; Tony\nnodded his head, Steve was probably right. </p><p>&ldquo;We should do it soon. We could throw a party for them.&rdquo; Steve\nnodded and kissed Tony&rsquo;s temple.</p><p>&ldquo;I like the sound of that.&rdquo; Tony leaned his head on Steve&rsquo;s\nshoulder and Steve took Tony&rsquo;s hand. These were Tony&rsquo;s favorite moments, the\nquiet ones. Where he could sit and enjoy Steve&rsquo;s company, when neither of them\nwere stressed or worried. These were the moments where Tony knew for certain\nthat he and Steve could survive absolutely anything. </p>",

But now that Peter is here,Steve and Tony both feel protective over him. It doesn&rsquo;t help that Peter hates everyone other than Steve and tony. But as Steve and tony raise Peter, they start to fall for one another. Will this superfamily work out or will it all turn to hell?<br />A/N: Sorry about the hiatus, didn&rsquo;t mean for that. Anyway i had major writer&rsquo;s block and i kinda gave up on this story.
