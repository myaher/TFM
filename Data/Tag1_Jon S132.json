That&rsquo;s until someone else arrives at the bar having an equally bad time of it.\n\n</p><p>Notes:\u00a0As you know, I am taking part in a challenge on tumblr by user <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjyUbEbLkq0xyg238lqGL3A\">@jonerysfics</a> and <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/me0ia9AS76vMZnm5qiSWLmA\">@mhysaofdragons</a> in which for seven days from Valentines day I am uploading a new one shot. The prompts have been provided and the stories have all been written and I gotta say you&rsquo;re in for a lot of Jonerys content. So Day 3, 16th February, which is when I&rsquo;m uploading this, the prompt I chose was &lsquo;Bad First Date&rsquo;. This is my spin on a situation many of us find ourselves in on Valentine&rsquo;s day.</p><p>Link:\u00a0<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17812064\">https://archiveofourown.org/works/17812064</a><br/></p><p>&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me, Viz?\u201d She sighs as she swirls the content of her glass in her hand. \u201cAm I just some sort of freak magnet?\u201d</p><p>Daenerys Targaryen had just returned from her third bad date of the month and given it was Valentine\u2019s Day tomorrow it was safe to say she\u2019d be spending it alone with a bottle of Rose and her pink vibrator.</p><p>\u201cNothing is wrong with you, Dany\u201d He implored from the other side of the bar, filling her drink to the brim again. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna meet the man of your dreams one day, I promise you. None of these men deserve the average woman let alone you. Your my sister, the best a man could get, I got your back don&rsquo;t worry about it!\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cThanks\u201d She puts a smile on, thankful for the niceties but in all honesty she just wanted to sit and wonder what had gone wrong.</p><p>One of them, had worked at a pet shop, which was fine, until he\u2019d said that he takes the python to bed every night so it gets used to him. There was no way this side of hell she\u2019d get in a bed with a snake that wasn\u2019t attached to a man.</p><p>Fucking weirdo.</p><p>She shuddered to just think about it.</p><p>Another only wanted sex and told her outright from the minute they sat down in a fancy restaurant, turned out she\u2019d arranged a date with a sugar daddy who was willing to give her \u00a33000 for sleeping with him. Not the man to bring home to Rhaella Targaryen.</p><p>And then the one she\u2019d just ran from, offered her a gift of his fingernail clippings and a Manchester United shirt. Daenerys didn\u2019t know which one she was more disgusted by, her father never speak to her again if she wore the shirt and the nail clippings was just outright gross.</p><p>One day, I\u2019ll date someone normal.</p><p>\u201cScotch, neat please\u201d She hears a northern accent sound from the seat next to her, a sound which she associated with a bad day. At least she wasn\u2019t the only one.</p><p>\u201cComing right up, sir\u201d Her brother nods and fixes the man up with one. Dany turns sideways to glance at the man who has just decided to sit next to her and when she does, her eyes widen with feint recognition.</p><p>I know you\u2026</p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d She asks, unsure if it really is him. He turns and looks at her, his eyes confused for a moment while he sips his drink. Then, it clicks into place.</p><p>\u201cDaenerys Targaryen?\u201d He becomes nervous, shakily putting his glass down, and they both know why that is. Time flies, this was a blast from the past she had not been expecting.</p><p>Damn, he looks like a right snack \u2026 she thinks to herself. Jon Snow, she used to go to High school with him over ten years ago. He was a lot smaller then, in terms of muscle, but she could see his arms and torso almost pulsating through the shirt he had on now.</p><p>\u201cHow have you been? You look great\u201d She almost smiles suggestively, sipping her own drink. She was eighteen when she last looked into those eyes. I sucked his dick in the school toilets in year 10, 15 years old and way inexperienced . Her luck with men clearly hadn\u2019t changed that much. He says he&rsquo;s been good and thanks her for the compliment. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in what, twelve years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout that, I just turned 30\u201d He confirms, a look of reminiscing present on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat you doing in town anyways? Last I heard you\u2019d flown to New York to work\u201d She asked interested more so in his sudden reappearance in town than the lame dates she\u2019d been on. Anything to stop being traumatised by fingernail clippings&hellip;</p><p>\u201cOh, I came back years ago\u201d He said with a chuckle, gruff and causing a slight tingling in Dany&rsquo;s ears. \u201cIt was a great experience but, I missed home. My sister Sansa fell pregnant with her partner at the age of 20 and I just decided to come home and work and be a good uncle\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that, my friend Missandei is always travelling the world, comes home every few months. Nothing like the comforts of home, she says\u201d She sighed, looking into her once again empty glass. It was strange how the conversation seemed easy.</p><p>\u201cYou want a refill, Dany?\u201d Viz asks.</p><p>\u201cGo on then, brother. Give Jon one too, put it on my tab\u201d She asks and Jon nods in appreciation. \u201cSo why you at the bar then? You haven\u2019t happened to finish up a bad date like me? Or should I say I got the hell out of there as quickly as possible\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, yes\u201d He laughs to her surprise. Maybe today was the day the universe turned on decent people . \u201cRedhead, nice girl or at least I thought so, she wanted me to do the spaghetti scene from Lady and the Tramp with her at Hotel Paris on Baelor\u2019s street\u201d</p><p>\u201cGods above\u201d Dany\u2019s wide eyed response got Jon laughing. \u201cI thought mine was bad\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess, hair strands given as a gift?\u201d Jon snorted.</p><p>\u201cClose, nail clippings\u201d The laugh on his face dropped as if he was going to be sick. He asks her if she was being serious, she nodded. \u201cHe also gave me a Manchester United Shirt so I had to dip on him, I should\u2019ve known something was off when he didn\u2019t want gravy on a roast dinner, what kind of moron doesn\u2019t want that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are some strange folk around\u201d Jon agreed, both of them kinda silent for a moment. However, Jon instigates the conversation once again. \u201cHow about yourself, what have you been up to?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s hot\u2026</p><p>Really fucking hot&hellip;</p><p>Like bend me over your knee and fist me like I&rsquo;m nothing hot&hellip;</p><p>Daenerys, behave yourself\u2026</p><p>\u201cI run a non-profit\u201d Dany replies, trying to temper her feelings. \u201cIt\u2019s for helping women who\u2019s been apart of domestic abuse get their life back on track, help with hygiene and food and school for their children, other than that I work on my father\u2019s board of executives for his solar company which develop more economical ways to create electricity\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo long story short, everything you wanted to do in high-school didn\u2019t happen\u201d He laughs, they both have to. A familiar memory of her dancing outside the school toilets to entice Jon in, ringing through their minds. What a wild and free-spirited individual she was then&hellip;</p><p>\u201cI did not become a dancer, no\u201d Daenerys found it really easy to talk to him, perhaps it was his familiarity. \u201cInstead I just become a woman who has every aspect of her life going accept the one she has an interest in working\u201d</p><p>\u201cPah, relationships are shit anyways\u201d He grumbles and Dany can&rsquo;t help but chuckle at him. The distant memory of a redheaded girl leaving him for some other hotshot man came into her mind.</p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;re not still upset about her, are you? Ygritte?\u201d She giggles. His solemn silence answers it all. \u201cJon, that was Year 12\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill hurts\u201d He shrugged, striking her as the type to never get over something truly. \u201cNever met anyone like her since\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, the lying and cheating type is hard to come by\u201d She cackles before gulping the last of her drink. If she wasn\u2019t careful she\u2019d fall off of her chair. \u201cLook, there\u2019s someone out there, bad dates just mean you\u2019re getting through that shit to find them. Optimism!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUrgh, I hate that word\u201d Well at least he\u2019s honest\u2026</p><p>\u201cJon\u201d Dany stated plainly. \u201cYou do realise you\u2019re a bit of a snack, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a bit of a what?\u201d He blinks, unaware of what is about to come out of Daenerys mouth.</p><p>\u201cA snack\u201d She nods. \u201cLook at you, that curly hair still looks as well maintained as it did at our Leavers ball, your eyes are deep and mysterious, you clearly work out, your accent is gruff and sexy and you smile like a child who just found a stash of cupcakes, you\u2019re a total snack\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere we go\u201d She hears her brother mumble and walk off to serve other customers. Shut your face, Viz.</p><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s a lot to process\u201d Jon chortles, but he knows it\u2019s meant in good fun.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s suppose to be a compliment\u201d Dany speaks sincerely, a hand placed on his knee to show her sincerity. \u201cAny girl who acts a fool, or turns you down, or cheats on you, is a fucking moron\u201d</p><p>Well done, Daenerys, just open your legs why don\u2019t you, cut to the chase .</p><p>Daenerys wasn\u2019t finished. \u201cAnd anyways, last week I went on a date with a guy who wanted to put me in his bed with his pet Python, so it can\u2019t ever be that bad\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople are indeed strange\u201d He agrees once more. Fucking hell if he smoulders at me one more time I&rsquo;m taking my knickers of now and he can fuck me against the bar . \u00a0</p><p>They were quiet after that, just a small groaning of the jukebox behind them playing tunes and the sounds of snooker cues hitting balls. Dany looked around, anywhere but Jon while she collected her thoughts.</p><p>Why not?</p><p>That\u2019s all she can find herself to say. So what if she sucked his dick once all those years ago, so what if it\u2019s only because they\u2019ve both had bad dates and they were just looking for a bit of human contact. It\u2019s just sex right, she should at least ask or she won\u2019t get.</p><p>\u201cHey Jon\u201d</p><p>\u201c-Dany\u201d</p><p>They both realised they\u2019d spoke at the same time.</p><p>\u201cSorry, you go first\u201d Jon offered.</p><p>\u201cOh, okay\u201d She nodded, her eyebrow rising as a little smirk appeared on her face. \u201cYou wanna get out of here?\u201d</p><p>If there\u2019s any justice in the world, you will say yes, Jon Snow.</p><p>There\u2019s a moment where she thinks she\u2019s fucked up, but when the same smirking expression is sent back to her, she knows there\u2019s only one place she\u2019s going tonight, and that was the backseat of her car.</p><p>\u201cDepends\u201d He shrugs before stepping off of his seat and whispering in her ear. \u201cAre you going to be a bad girl for me?\u201d</p><p>Dany starts giggling, completely surprised that her evening was going to be not all bad and actually looked like quite a promising night. The prospect of showing Jon Snow how she&rsquo;d improved since the blowie in the school toilets days filling her with fire and want. \u201cIs the sky blue?\u201d</p><p>&ldquo;Excellent&rdquo; Jon grins, gulping his drink and smashing it on the table. He hops off of his bar stool, guides Dany off of hers and smacks her behind with glee when she begins to lead him out the door, a wave goodbye to her brother. </p><p>Now this was going to be a good evening&hellip;</p>",

Shut your face, Viz.</p><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s a lot to process\u201d Jon chortles, but he knows it\u2019s meant in good fun.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s suppose to be a compliment\u201d Dany speaks sincerely, a hand placed on his knee to show her sincerity. \u201cAny girl who acts a fool, or turns you down, or cheats on you, is a fucking moron\u201d</p><p>Well done, Daenerys, just open your legs why don\u2019t you, cut to the chase .</p><p>Daenerys wasn\u2019t finished. \u201cAnd anyways, last week I went on a date with a guy who wanted to put me in his bed with his pet Python, so it can\u2019t ever be that bad\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople are indeed strange\u201d He agrees once more. Fucking hell if he smoulders at me one more time I\u2019m taking my knickers of now and he can fuck me against the bar . \u00a0</p><p>They were quiet after that, just a small groaning of the jukebox behind them playing tunes and the sounds of snooker cues hitting balls. Dany looked around, anywhere but Jon while she collected her thoughts.</p><p>Why not?</p><p>That\u2019s all she can find herself to say. So what if she sucked his dick once all those years ago, so what if it\u2019s only because they\u2019ve both had bad dates and they were just looking for a bit of human contact. It\u2019s just sex right, she should at least ask or she won\u2019t get.</p><p>\u201cHey Jon\u201d</p><p>\u201c-Dany\u201d</p><p>They both realised they\u2019d spoke at the same time.</p><p>\u201cSorry, you go first\u201d Jon offered.</p><p>\u201cOh, okay\u201d She nodded, her eyebrow rising as a little smirk appeared on her face. \u201cYou wanna get out of here?\u201d</p><p>If there\u2019s any justice in the world, you will say yes, Jon Snow.</p><p>There\u2019s a moment where she thinks she\u2019s fucked up, but when the same smirking expression is sent back to her, she knows there\u2019s only one place she\u2019s going tonight, and that was the backseat of her car.</p><p>\u201cDepends\u201d He shrugs before stepping off of his seat and whispering in her ear. \u201cAre you going to be a bad girl for me?\u201d</p><p>Dany starts giggling, completely surprised that her evening was going to be not all bad and actually looked like quite a promising night. The prospect of showing Jon Snow how she\u2019d improved since the blowie in the school toilets days filling her with fire and want. \u201cIs the sky blue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent\u201d Jon grins, gulping his drink and smashing it on the table. He hops off of his bar stool, guides Dany off of hers and smacks her behind with glee when she begins to lead him out the door, a wave goodbye to her brother. </p><p>Now this was going to be a good evening\u2026</p>",

That\u2019s until someone else arrives at the bar having an equally bad time of it.\n\n</p><p>Notes:\u00a0As you know, I am taking part in a challenge on tumblr by user <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjyUbEbLkq0xyg238lqGL3A\">@jonerysfics</a> and <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/me0ia9AS76vMZnm5qiSWLmA\">@mhysaofdragons</a> in which for seven days from Valentines day I am uploading a new one shot. The prompts have been provided and the stories have all been written and I gotta say you\u2019re in for a lot of Jonerys content. So Day 3, 16th February, which is when I\u2019m uploading this, the prompt I chose was \u2018Bad First Date\u2019. This is my spin on a situation many of us find ourselves in on Valentine\u2019s day.</p><p>Link:\u00a0<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17812064\">https://archiveofourown.org/works/17812064</a><br></p><p>\u2014\u2013</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me, Viz?\u201d She sighs as she swirls the content of her glass in her hand. \u201cAm I just some sort of freak magnet?\u201d</p><p>Daenerys Targaryen had just returned from her third bad date of the month and given it was Valentine\u2019s Day tomorrow it was safe to say she\u2019d be spending it alone with a bottle of Rose and her pink vibrator.</p><p>\u201cNothing is wrong with you, Dany\u201d He implored from the other side of the bar, filling her drink to the brim again. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna meet the man of your dreams one day, I promise you. None of these men deserve the average woman let alone you. Your my sister, the best a man could get, I got your back don\u2019t worry about it!\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cThanks\u201d She puts a smile on, thankful for the niceties but in all honesty she just wanted to sit and wonder what had gone wrong.</p><p>One of them, had worked at a pet shop, which was fine, until he\u2019d said that he takes the python to bed every night so it gets used to him. There was no way this side of hell she\u2019d get in a bed with a snake that wasn\u2019t attached to a man.</p><p>Fucking weirdo.</p><p>She shuddered to just think about it.</p><p>Another only wanted sex and told her outright from the minute they sat down in a fancy restaurant, turned out she\u2019d arranged a date with a sugar daddy who was willing to give her \u00a33000 for sleeping with him. Not the man to bring home to Rhaella Targaryen.</p><p>And then the one she\u2019d just ran from, offered her a gift of his fingernail clippings and a Manchester United shirt. Daenerys didn\u2019t know which one she was more disgusted by, her father never speak to her again if she wore the shirt and the nail clippings was just outright gross.</p><p>One day, I\u2019ll date someone normal.</p><p>\u201cScotch, neat please\u201d She hears a northern accent sound from the seat next to her, a sound which she associated with a bad day. At least she wasn\u2019t the only one.</p><p>\u201cComing right up, sir\u201d Her brother nods and fixes the man up with one. Dany turns sideways to glance at the man who has just decided to sit next to her and when she does, her eyes widen with feint recognition.</p><p>I know you\u2026</p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d She asks, unsure if it really is him. He turns and looks at her, his eyes confused for a moment while he sips his drink. Then, it clicks into place.</p><p>\u201cDaenerys Targaryen?\u201d He becomes nervous, shakily putting his glass down, and they both know why that is. Time flies, this was a blast from the past she had not been expecting.</p><p>Damn, he looks like a right snack \u2026 she thinks to herself. Jon Snow, she used to go to High school with him over ten years ago. He was a lot smaller then, in terms of muscle, but she could see his arms and torso almost pulsating through the shirt he had on now.</p><p>\u201cHow have you been? You look great\u201d She almost smiles suggestively, sipping her own drink. She was eighteen when she last looked into those eyes. I sucked his dick in the school toilets in year 10, 15 years old and way inexperienced . Her luck with men clearly hadn\u2019t changed that much. He says he\u2019s been good and thanks her for the compliment. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in what, twelve years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout that, I just turned 30\u201d He confirms, a look of reminiscing present on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat you doing in town anyways? Last I heard you\u2019d flown to New York to work\u201d She asked interested more so in his sudden reappearance in town than the lame dates she\u2019d been on. Anything to stop being traumatised by fingernail clippings\u2026</p><p>\u201cOh, I came back years ago\u201d He said with a chuckle, gruff and causing a slight tingling in Dany\u2019s ears. \u201cIt was a great experience but, I missed home. My sister Sansa fell pregnant with her partner at the age of 20 and I just decided to come home and work and be a good uncle\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that, my friend Missandei is always travelling the world, comes home every few months. Nothing like the comforts of home, she says\u201d She sighed, looking into her once again empty glass. It was strange how the conversation seemed easy.</p><p>\u201cYou want a refill, Dany?\u201d Viz asks.</p><p>\u201cGo on then, brother. Give Jon one too, put it on my tab\u201d She asks and Jon nods in appreciation. \u201cSo why you at the bar then? You haven\u2019t happened to finish up a bad date like me? Or should I say I got the hell out of there as quickly as possible\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, yes\u201d He laughs to her surprise. Maybe today was the day the universe turned on decent people . \u201cRedhead, nice girl or at least I thought so, she wanted me to do the spaghetti scene from Lady and the Tramp with her at Hotel Paris on Baelor\u2019s street\u201d</p><p>\u201cGods above\u201d Dany\u2019s wide eyed response got Jon laughing. \u201cI thought mine was bad\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess, hair strands given as a gift?\u201d Jon snorted.</p><p>\u201cClose, nail clippings\u201d The laugh on his face dropped as if he was going to be sick. He asks her if she was being serious, she nodded. \u201cHe also gave me a Manchester United Shirt so I had to dip on him, I should\u2019ve known something was off when he didn\u2019t want gravy on a roast dinner, what kind of moron doesn\u2019t want that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are some strange folk around\u201d Jon agreed, both of them kinda silent for a moment. However, Jon instigates the conversation once again. \u201cHow about yourself, what have you been up to?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s hot\u2026</p><p>Really fucking hot\u2026</p><p>Like bend me over your knee and fist me like I\u2019m nothing hot\u2026</p><p>Daenerys, behave yourself\u2026</p><p>\u201cI run a non-profit\u201d Dany replies, trying to temper her feelings. \u201cIt\u2019s for helping women who\u2019s been apart of domestic abuse get their life back on track, help with hygiene and food and school for their children, other than that I work on my father\u2019s board of executives for his solar company which develop more economical ways to create electricity\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo long story short, everything you wanted to do in high-school didn\u2019t happen\u201d He laughs, they both have to. A familiar memory of her dancing outside the school toilets to entice Jon in, ringing through their minds. What a wild and free-spirited individual she was then\u2026</p><p>\u201cI did not become a dancer, no\u201d Daenerys found it really easy to talk to him, perhaps it was his familiarity. \u201cInstead I just become a woman who has every aspect of her life going accept the one she has an interest in working\u201d</p><p>\u201cPah, relationships are shit anyways\u201d He grumbles and Dany can\u2019t help but chuckle at him. The distant memory of a redheaded girl leaving him for some other hotshot man came into her mind.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not still upset about her, are you? Ygritte?\u201d She giggles. His solemn silence answers it all. \u201cJon, that was Year 12\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill hurts\u201d He shrugged, striking her as the type to never get over something truly. \u201cNever met anyone like her since\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, the lying and cheating type is hard to come by\u201d She cackles before gulping the last of her drink. If she wasn\u2019t careful she\u2019d fall off of her chair. \u201cLook, there\u2019s someone out there, bad dates just mean you\u2019re getting through that shit to find them. Optimism!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUrgh, I hate that word\u201d Well at least he\u2019s honest\u2026</p><p>\u201cJon\u201d Dany stated plainly. \u201cYou do realise you\u2019re a bit of a snack, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a bit of a what?\u201d He blinks, unaware of what is about to come out of Daenerys mouth.</p><p>\u201cA snack\u201d She nods. \u201cLook at you, that curly hair still looks as well maintained as it did at our Leavers ball, your eyes are deep and mysterious, you clearly work out, your accent is gruff and sexy and you smile like a child who just found a stash of cupcakes, you\u2019re a total snack\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere we go\u201d She hears her brother mumble and walk off to serve other customers.

Or should I say I got the hell out of there as quickly as possible&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Actually, yes&rdquo; He laughs to her surprise. Maybe today was the day the universe turned on decent people . &ldquo;Redhead, nice girl or at least I thought so, she wanted me to do the spaghetti scene from Lady and the Tramp with her at Hotel Paris on Baelor&rsquo;s street&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Gods above&rdquo; Dany&rsquo;s wide eyed response got Jon laughing. &ldquo;I thought mine was bad&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let me guess, hair strands given as a gift?&rdquo; Jon snorted.</p><p>&ldquo;Close, nail clippings&rdquo; The laugh on his face dropped as if he was going to be sick. He asks her if she was being serious, she nodded. &ldquo;He also gave me a Manchester United Shirt so I had to dip on him, I should&rsquo;ve known something was off when he didn&rsquo;t want gravy on a roast dinner, what kind of moron doesn&rsquo;t want that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There are some strange folk around&rdquo; Jon agreed, both of them kinda silent for a moment. However, Jon instigates the conversation once again. &ldquo;How about yourself, what have you been up to?&rdquo;</p><p>He&rsquo;s hot&hellip;</p><p>Really fucking hot&hellip;</p><p>Like bend me over your knee and fist me like I&rsquo;m nothing hot&hellip;</p><p>Daenerys, behave yourself&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;I run a non-profit&rdquo; Dany replies, trying to temper her feelings. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for helping women who&rsquo;s been apart of domestic abuse get their life back on track, help with hygiene and food and school for their children, other than that I work on my father&rsquo;s board of executives for his solar company which develop more economical ways to create electricity&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So long story short, everything you wanted to do in high-school didn&rsquo;t happen&rdquo; He laughs, they both have to. A familiar memory of her dancing outside the school toilets to entice Jon in, ringing through their minds. What a wild and free-spirited individual she was then&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;I did not become a dancer, no&rdquo; Daenerys found it really easy to talk to him, perhaps it was his familiarity. &ldquo;Instead I just become a woman who has every aspect of her life going accept the one she has an interest in working&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pah, relationships are shit anyways&rdquo; He grumbles and Dany can&rsquo;t help but chuckle at him. The distant memory of a redheaded girl leaving him for some other hotshot man came into her mind.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not still upset about her, are you? Ygritte?&rdquo; She giggles. His solemn silence answers it all. &ldquo;Jon, that was Year 12&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Still hurts&rdquo; He shrugged, striking her as the type to never get over something truly. &ldquo;Never met anyone like her since&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, the lying and cheating type is hard to come by&rdquo; She cackles before gulping the last of her drink. If she wasn&rsquo;t careful she&rsquo;d fall off of her chair. &ldquo;Look, there&rsquo;s someone out there, bad dates just mean you&rsquo;re getting through that shit to find them. Optimism!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Urgh, I hate that word&rdquo; Well at least he&rsquo;s honest&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Jon&rdquo; Dany stated plainly. &ldquo;You do realise you&rsquo;re a bit of a snack, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a bit of a what?&rdquo; He blinks, unaware of what is about to come out of Daenerys mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;A snack&rdquo; She nods. &ldquo;Look at you, that curly hair still looks as well maintained as it did at our Leavers ball, your eyes are deep and mysterious, you clearly work out, your accent is gruff and sexy and you smile like a child who just found a stash of cupcakes, you&rsquo;re a total snack&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Here we go&rdquo; She hears her brother mumble and walk off to serve other customers. Shut your face, Viz.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, that&rsquo;s a lot to process&rdquo; Jon chortles, but he knows it&rsquo;s meant in good fun.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s suppose to be a compliment&rdquo; Dany speaks sincerely, a hand placed on his knee to show her sincerity. &ldquo;Any girl who acts a fool, or turns you down, or cheats on you, is a fucking moron&rdquo;</p><p>Well done, Daenerys, just open your legs why don&rsquo;t you, cut to the chase .</p><p>Daenerys wasn&rsquo;t finished. &ldquo;And anyways, last week I went on a date with a guy who wanted to put me in his bed with his pet Python, so it can&rsquo;t ever be that bad&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;People are indeed strange&rdquo; He agrees once more. Fucking hell if he smoulders at me one more time I&rsquo;m taking my knickers of now and he can fuck me against the bar . &nbsp;</p><p>They were quiet after that, just a small groaning of the jukebox behind them playing tunes and the sounds of snooker cues hitting balls. Dany looked around, anywhere but Jon while she collected her thoughts.</p><p>Why not?</p><p>That&rsquo;s all she can find herself to say. So what if she sucked his dick once all those years ago, so what if it&rsquo;s only because they&rsquo;ve both had bad dates and they were just looking for a bit of human contact. It&rsquo;s just sex right, she should at least ask or she won&rsquo;t get.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Jon&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;-Dany&rdquo;</p><p>They both realised they&rsquo;d spoke at the same time.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, you go first&rdquo; Jon offered.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, okay&rdquo; She nodded, her eyebrow rising as a little smirk appeared on her face. &ldquo;You wanna get out of here?&rdquo;</p><p>If there&rsquo;s any justice in the world, you will say yes, Jon Snow.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a moment where she thinks she&rsquo;s fucked up, but when the same smirking expression is sent back to her, she knows there&rsquo;s only one place she&rsquo;s going tonight, and that was the backseat of her car.</p><p>&ldquo;Depends&rdquo; He shrugs before stepping off of his seat and whispering in her ear. &ldquo;Are you going to be a bad girl for me?&rdquo;</p><p>Dany starts giggling, completely surprised that her evening was going to be not all bad and actually looked like quite a promising night. The prospect of showing Jon Snow how she&rsquo;d improved since the blowie in the school toilets days filling her with fire and want. &ldquo;Is the sky blue?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Excellent&rdquo; Jon grins, gulping his drink and smashing it on the table. He hops off of his bar stool, guides Dany off of hers and smacks her behind with glee when she begins to lead him out the door, a wave goodbye to her brother. </p><p>Now this was going to be a good evening&hellip;</p>",

Silently he hoped he would not find you, that he would return to the camp empty-handed and find you waiting for him by the fire in your tent, a smile gracing your lips just for him. Inhaling deeply, he lifted his head to the sound of Tormund calling his name, his voice sounding disturbed and upset, looking in the direction of his voice, Jon saw him standing there his shoulders visibly slumped and his head hanging to the ground as he once again called out Jon\u2019s name. \u00a0Despite the heavy thumps in his chest, Jon could feel his breaths growing shallow, his stomach dropping at the sight of a body lying motionless at Tormund\u2019s feet, his own feet feeling as if they were frozen solid to the ground beneath, unable to move him forward. \u00a0</p><p>Jon didn\u2019t know how his legs got him moving, yet they did and the closer he got to Tormund the more he wanted to turn around and run, but he couldn\u2019t, he had to know, was it you? \u00a0With unwilling eyes, he dropped his gaze to the ground, instantly recognizing the cloak that was wrapped around your unmoving form, his throat restricting the flow of air to his chest and his heart feeling heavy with the worst kind of dread. \u00a0Falling to his knees, he picked your breathless body up into his arms turning you around, he needed to see your face, your skin so pale and cold as your (EC) eyes, which were once so beautiful and full of life, stared back at him dull and hollow. Unable to bear the sight, he took a gentle hand and closed them for you, never to open again, the mere thought sending his body numb. \u00a0</p><p>With tender fingers, Jon brushed the dirt from your cheeks and it would have been easy to think of you asleep. Your face was now clean, there was no blood and your (HC) hair fell in soft locks around your peaceful features. \u00a0Moving his gaze over your body, you looked unharmed but for a single wound piercing your torso, there was no flow of blood and your clothes were barely drenched in red. Placing his fingers to your wound it felt cold and frozen, the snow sealing over your flesh as you had fallen to the ground. \u00a0Pulling you into his chest, he felt despair wash over him, sorrow filling every thought in his head and every fibre of his body, your arm hanging to the ground, moving limply with every heave of his grieving body. \u00a0</p><p>Cradling your head under his chin, he wondered how he would go on without you, you had been his life for so long now and suddenly you were gone, gone forever. Never would he see you smile again, never hear you laugh and never hear you cry, never touch your warm and inviting lips with his and never grow old with you. Standing up he held you tight looking around the field listlessly not knowing what to do, not knowing where to go, taking steps back and forth leading him nowhere, yet unable to stand still his grief rendering him helpless. Once again, he fell to his knees his legs collapsing from under him, his body falling into the fresh white snow, still holding you against his chest. \u00a0Laying there, he welcomed the soft, cold powder as it enveloped him, surrounding his body making him feel numb, hoping and praying it would let him feel nothing.

One moment you were fighting by his side, the next moment, he was piercing a white walker with longclaw, watching him shatter into a million pieces, before turning around and finding you gone. Silently he hoped he would not find you, that he would return to the camp empty-handed and find you waiting for him by the fire in your tent, a smile gracing your lips just for him. Inhaling deeply, he lifted his head to the sound of Tormund calling his name, his voice sounding disturbed and upset, looking in the direction of his voice, Jon saw him standing there his shoulders visibly slumped and his head hanging to the ground as he once again called out Jon\u2019s name. \u00a0Despite the heavy thumps in his chest, Jon could feel his breaths growing shallow, his stomach dropping at the sight of a body lying motionless at Tormund\u2019s feet, his own feet feeling as if they were frozen solid to the ground beneath, unable to move him forward. \u00a0</p><p>Jon didn\u2019t know how his legs got him moving, yet they did and the closer he got to Tormund the more he wanted to turn around and run, but he couldn\u2019t, he had to know, was it you? \u00a0With unwilling eyes, he dropped his gaze to the ground, instantly recognizing the cloak that was wrapped around your unmoving form, his throat restricting the flow of air to his chest and his heart feeling heavy with the worst kind of dread. \u00a0Falling to his knees, he picked your breathless body up into his arms turning you around, he needed to see your face, your skin so pale and cold as your (EC) eyes, which were once so beautiful and full of life, stared back at him dull and hollow. Unable to bear the sight, he took a gentle hand and closed them for you, never to open again, the mere thought sending his body numb. \u00a0</p><p>With tender fingers, Jon brushed the dirt from your cheeks and it would have been easy to think of you asleep. Your face was now clean, there was no blood and your (HC) hair fell in soft locks around your peaceful features. \u00a0Moving his gaze over your body, you looked unharmed but for a single wound piercing your torso, there was no flow of blood and your clothes were barely drenched in red. Placing his fingers to your wound it felt cold and frozen, the snow sealing over your flesh as you had fallen to the ground. \u00a0Pulling you into his chest, he felt despair wash over him, sorrow filling every thought in his head and every fibre of his body, your arm hanging to the ground, moving limply with every heave of his grieving body. \u00a0</p><p>Cradling your head under his chin, he wondered how he would go on without you, you had been his life for so long now and suddenly you were gone, gone forever. Never would he see you smile again, never hear you laugh and never hear you cry, never touch your warm and inviting lips with his and never grow old with you. Standing up he held you tight looking around the field listlessly not knowing what to do, not knowing where to go, taking steps back and forth leading him nowhere, yet unable to stand still his grief rendering him helpless. Once again, he fell to his knees his legs collapsing from under him, his body falling into the fresh white snow, still holding you against his chest. \u00a0Laying there, he welcomed the soft, cold powder as it enveloped him, surrounding his body making him feel numb, hoping and praying it would let him feel nothing. Yet, realising with monopolizing despair that nothing would help him, you were gone and you were gone forever.</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muxxAdObOV7oiq-55ffCLWQ\">@tessimagines</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR66EnpofMvxuwSBpSnkxog\">@heyohheyitsgabi</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx9xXhoyhumGz3Ie_ad2tGA\">@buckybarnesyard</a></p></p>",

He couldn\u2019t witness this any longer. He couldn\u2019t just stand here doing nothing for the rest of her life.</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s okay.\u201d He broke all rules when he whispered and wrapped his arms around her. \u201cYou&rsquo;re not alone.\u201d He didn\u2019t care what would happen to him. </p><p>They could cast him out. They could banish him. The could force him to live the rest of his life as a human. </p><p>He didn\u2019t care. </p><p>Everything was better than simply watching Sansa like this, screaming and kicking and fighting. Everything was better than knowing that not even in her sleep she was free. Everything was better than leaving her alone when she needed him the most.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d Sansa replied, but she wrapped her arms around his neck and buried her face in his chest. \u201cNo one believes me when I tell them what he does.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cNo one really truly cares about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Jon pressed the palms of his hands to her wet cheeks and forced her to look at him. \u201cI do.\u201d He locked his glance with hers.</p><p>In that moment Sansa seemed to realise that she had never seen him before, that she was being comforted by a total stranger. \u201cWho are you?\u201d Her eyes widened. \u201cHow did you get here without him stopping you?\u201d</p><p>Jon swallowed, but what did he have to lose? He had already broken so many rules. Breaking a few more wouldn\u2019t matter. \u201cI\u2019m your guardian angel.\u201d</p><p>Even though she was still crying Sansa smiled. \u201cGuardian angels don\u2019t exist. They belong in fairytales, with the charming princes, the knights in shining armour and the happy endings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m probably going to hell for this.\u201d Jon rolled his eyes but then he unfolded his giant silver wings. </p><p>A little reluctantly Sansa stretched out her hand to touch them.</p><p>His wings were sensitive and a shiver rolled down his spine when the tips of her fingers and his feathers met. </p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m not supposed to show or tell you this.\u201d Jon bent his head. </p><p>He wasn\u2019t the first to break the rules. And as long as there was cruelty in this world he probably wouldn\u2019t be the last one either. </p><p>\u201cBut you need every little bit of hope you can get.\u201d He looked up again and for the first time in years there was a genuine smile on Sansa\u2019s face. </p><p>And it made her even more beautiful than she had already been.</p><p>And in that moment he decided that he would not wait for them to banish him to earth to live a human life. He would go and ask for it. </p><p>\u201cCan you take me with you to heaven?\u201d Sansa\u2019s smile faltered and once more Jon wrapped his arms around her to press her to his chest.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cBut I\u2019ll come to earth, to you and together we\u2019ll find a way to get you out of this mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you promise me that?\u201d Sansa looked up at him and the tears stopped rolling down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d He nodded. \u201cYou deserve a better life, with someone who really loves you, with someone who doesn\u2019t hurt you, with someone who knows that you\u2019re a queen and treats you as such.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith someone like you?\u201d Sansa cocked her head and Jon felt his cheeks heating up.</p><p>\u201cWith whomever you want to be with.\u201d</p><p>With him or with someone else. It didn\u2019t matter. As long as she would finally be happy.</p>",

The could force him to live the rest of his life as a human. </p><p>He didn\u2019t care. </p><p>Everything was better than simply watching Sansa like this, screaming and kicking and fighting. Everything was better than knowing that not even in her sleep she was free. Everything was better than leaving her alone when she needed him the most.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d Sansa replied, but she wrapped her arms around his neck and buried her face in his chest. \u201cNo one believes me when I tell them what he does.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cNo one really truly cares about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Jon pressed the palms of his hands to her wet cheeks and forced her to look at him. \u201cI do.\u201d He locked his glance with hers.</p><p>In that moment Sansa seemed to realise that she had never seen him before, that she was being comforted by a total stranger. \u201cWho are you?\u201d Her eyes widened. \u201cHow did you get here without him stopping you?\u201d</p><p>Jon swallowed, but what did he have to lose? He had already broken so many rules. Breaking a few more wouldn\u2019t matter. \u201cI\u2019m your guardian angel.\u201d</p><p>Even though she was still crying Sansa smiled. \u201cGuardian angels don\u2019t exist. They belong in fairytales, with the charming princes, the knights in shining armour and the happy endings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m probably going to hell for this.\u201d Jon rolled his eyes but then he unfolded his giant silver wings. </p><p>A little reluctantly Sansa stretched out her hand to touch them.</p><p>His wings were sensitive and a shiver rolled down his spine when the tips of her fingers and his feathers met. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not supposed to show or tell you this.\u201d Jon bent his head. </p><p>He wasn\u2019t the first to break the rules. And as long as there was cruelty in this world he probably wouldn\u2019t be the last one either. </p><p>\u201cBut you need every little bit of hope you can get.\u201d He looked up again and for the first time in years there was a genuine smile on Sansa\u2019s face. </p><p>And it made her even more beautiful than she had already been.</p><p>And in that moment he decided that he would not wait for them to banish him to earth to live a human life. He would go and ask for it. </p><p>\u201cCan you take me with you to heaven?\u201d Sansa\u2019s smile faltered and once more Jon wrapped his arms around her to press her to his chest.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cBut I\u2019ll come to earth, to you and together we\u2019ll find a way to get you out of this mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you promise me that?\u201d Sansa looked up at him and the tears stopped rolling down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d He nodded. \u201cYou deserve a better life, with someone who really loves you, with someone who doesn\u2019t hurt you, with someone who knows that you\u2019re a queen and treats you as such.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith someone like you?\u201d Sansa cocked her head and Jon felt his cheeks heating up.</p><p>\u201cWith whomever you want to be with.\u201d</p><p>With him or with someone else. It didn\u2019t matter. As long as she would finally be happy.</p></p>",
