Yet, (perhaps therefore) their offering for Black Friday is a bit shallow. Good deals are still out there but you will find them in far fewer varieties than Xbox. To start things off, literally every big box and electronics store is going to have the Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man Slim 1TB PS4 for $199.99. GameStop, Walmart, Best Buy, and Target all have the bundle and it is easily Sony\u2019s best offering this year. Both Walmart and GameStop have a PSVR Bundle that includes Astro Bot, a charming VR platformer that is impressing critics across the board right now, all for a chill $199. For a VR headset bundle this is really nothing to shake a stick at. I have to emphasize though, these bundles DO NOT include the PS4. You must purchase that separately. Gamestop also has a PSVR bundle that includes both the acclaimed Moss, and perhaps the most fun shooter I have ever played SUPERHOT. That bundle weighs in at $249.

Bullied constantly by most of his peers throughout high school. He is best friends with Harry Osborne, while he has a shared crush on the hot red-haired girl next door named Mary Jane Watson. Things go wrong on a field trip, and he gets bitten by a spider that eventually turned him in Spider-Man literally overnight. Boom. Villains, fighting for the girl he loves, whatever.\u00a0</p><p>If I am to be perfectly honest, I have to say that Tobey Maguire\u2019s representation of Spider-Man is the most true to the comics out of the three. Without a doubt in my mind whatsoever. There are striking inaccuracies, yet it at least includes the same concepts and characters. Stays really consistent.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"236\" data-orig-width=\"500\" style=\"\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0234aac65817272495abb9956960f5aa/tumblr_inline_pij5v6dzDw1wsagmq_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"236\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p>I grew up with the trilogy\u2014the movies were the reason why I became so invested into reading comics and watching other superhero movies.

It is clearly established early on in the film that his parents left, and all he has left is his Aunt May and Uncle Ben. Again, the bullied kid in high school that has a crush on the hot, intelligent girl named Gwen Stacy. Fucking edgy if you ask me, but he gets bitten by a spider again that progressively gives him his powers, and the rest is history. Amazing. Crime-fighting.</p><p>&hellip;&hellip;. yes.\u00a0</p><p>I don\u2019t like Garfield&rsquo;s representation of Peter Parker because he was&hellip;something else. This one was more of an edgelord than a nerd that was invested in science and photography (as far as I can remember), so I dock the points there. I\u2019ll give\u00a0\u2018im credit for having to build his own web slingers and produce his own web with chemicals because that is how the core spider-verse comics portray it\u2014web doesn\u2019t come out naturally.</p><hr><p>Tom Holland is a little better although his overarching plotline is far from the core spider-verse comics, being intertwined with the Avengers and such. He gets credit for being a relatable, dumb kid like most of us.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"720\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/78b0032588b11bd4a22796b6c643a672/tumblr_inline_pij6ehvT871wsagmq_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"720\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/></figure><p>Meet Peter Parker. Clearly an awkward teenage boy who was suddenly granted these amazing powers that he has no idea what he is doing with. He has fortunately decided to use them for good is the important part, and he really tries his best to be independent like he feels he is expected to be. Bullied, nerdy high school student with his best buddy Ned and a crush on the hot, intelligent Senior girl. Good kid. His Aunt May gets hit on a lot.</p><p>I was a little disappointed in how the recent movies have represented Spider-Man as a teenager, when in the official Civil War arc in the comics presented him clearly as an adult. He even unmasked himself to the public in the comics, where he made it clear that he sided with Tony Stark. His character was ultimately redeemed by how accurately (?) they represented high school life in a way. It\u2019s something the other two films could not have captured, so this gets major credit. Far better than TASM.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"563\" data-orig-width=\"1000\" style=\"\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e6363bf559f3b9f962bac8f6a3c32b5d/tumblr_inline_pij6p8Aa0e1wsagmq_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"563\" data-orig-width=\"1000\"/></figure><hr><p>So yeah that\u2019s it.
