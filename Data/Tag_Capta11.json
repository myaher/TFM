She didn't aged... she looks like 30, so if they give her a love interest in her next movie and the person is also 30-ish would it be weird because carol is actually on her fifties? But wouldn't also be weird if the person is 50-ish because they will actually look that age  and it might be weird to see brie with someone really older. It's kind of similar to cap but cap was frozen so he has the life experience of a 25 ish",

She was\nbeautiful, she was badass, she was kind\u2026 You were completely enamoured of her.\nAnd yet, you never actually said something about it to her, she liked you too,\nat least so you thought. You spend a lot of time together, talking and laughing\nabout literally anything, but never really flirty, she might just see you as a\nfriend, you thought and \u00a0today that\nassumption seemed to be proven as true.</p><!-- more --><p>Tony and\nPepper were holding their second wedding to renew their vows now that all the\ndusted had been brought back and Thanos defeated. You and Carol had been seated\nat the same table and she was telling you about a wedding she had once attended\non Hala, you always loved it when she told you about other galaxies and\nplanets, but you never could keep the thought from your mind that there\ncouldn\u2019t possibly be someone or something more otherworldly than her.</p><p>You found\nyour gaze trailing down to her lips as she spoke and only noticed what you were\ndoing when Carol cleared her throat.</p><p>\u201cAre you\neven listening to me?\u201d She gave you a little shove and grinned.</p><p>Flustered\nyou rubbed your neck. \u201cYeah, of course,\u201d you finally met her gaze again, \u201cI was\njust thinking, would you like to have a dance with me?\u201d</p><p>It was only\na dance, you told yourself, not an invitation for a date\u2026 There was absolutely\nno reason for your heart to beat as fast as it did in that moment.</p><p>\u201cI- uhm- I\ndon\u2019t dance,\u201d she evaded your gaze, seeming nervous, panicked even and you\nbrushed it off with a smile, trying to hide your disappointment and excused\nyourself, saying that you should probably find Tony and Pepper anyway to\ncongratulate them.</p><p>In the end\nit was only Tony you found, he was in the kitchen, looking for some extra\ndishes. He looked up when he heard you enter. You quickly gapped the space\nbetween you and wrapped your arms around him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so\nhappy for you, Tony,\u201d you pulled away and smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\nY/N,\u201d the pure joy that sparkled in Tony\u2019s eyes when he answered was something\nyou rarely saw on him, \u201cMind helping me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course\nnot,\u201d you accepted the plates he handed you and walked outside with him again.</p><p>Tony nodded\nover to where Carol was still sitting at the table, now talking with Fury and\nsmirked at you. \u201cHow\u2019s it going with Danvers?\u201d</p><p>You nearly\nlet the plates drop. \u201cWh-What?\u201d</p><p>Your answer\nonly made your friend grin wider. \u201cCome on, you are made for each other\u2026 I\nthought a romantic setting like this would maybe finally get you two to admit your\nfeelings for each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you\ntrying to set us up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just\nwant to help you out,\u201d he nudged your side with his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d\nyou rolled your eyes, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter anyway, because she clearly doesn\u2019t\nlike me like that.\u201d</p><p>Tony\nlaughed, but stopped when he realized your sad expression. \u201cWait, seriously? No\nway, N/N. She\u2019s pining for you just as much as you are pining for her, everyone\ncan see that.\u201d</p><p>You arrived\nat the buffet and set the dishes down but remained standing there with Tony as\nyou kept on talking.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t\nthink she does.\u201d</p><p>You tried\nto hide how much the thought hurt you, but Tony knew you too well, he wrapped\nan arm around your shoulders and pulled you into his side.</p><p>\u201cShe\ndoesn\u2019t even want to dance with me, she said \u2018I don\u2019t dance\u2019 as if we haven\u2019t\nbeen out for karaoke a thousand times with her dancing on table tops, maybe I shouldn\u2019t\nhave asked when there was such a slow song playing\u2026 She looked so uncomfortable\nwhen I asked her, Tony, maybe she isn\u2019t even into girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe\nshe\u2019s just shy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure\nwe\u2019re talking about the same Carol Danvers? Captain Marvel, Ms. \u2018Because before\nyou didn\u2019t have me\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Tony rolled\nhis eyes, \u201cI meant around you, shy about committing to her feelings, not in\ngeneral.\u201d</p><p>You sighed.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\nmaybe you two should just talk with each other, it\u2019s been six years\u2026 It\u2019s my\nwedding, I don\u2019t want to have to worry about one of my best friends pining over\nthe girl of her dreams without acting on her feelings for a second longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d\nyou mumbled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nkidding, Y/N,\u201d he released his grip around your shoulders and started heading\nback to the centre of the party, \u201cBut I swear, if the next time I see you two,\nyou aren\u2019t sucking face, I\u2019m gonna lock you both in a room until you finally\nopen your god damn mouths and talk to each other.\u201d</p><p>He walked\naway before you could answer and left you being not quite sure about whether he\nwas kidding about that too or not.</p><p>Shaking\nyour head you turned back around and your gaze landed yet again on Carol, she\nlooked away quickly, as if she had been caught staring. Fury on the other hand\nnodded over to you and cast a smirk at Carol. As you approached the table he\ngot up, straightening his trademark coat, that he apparently couldn\u2019t even lose\nfor a wedding, and shot you a wink before walking past you.</p><p>You looked\nafter him and saw him join Natasha, who was also looking at you with a light\ngrin. You turned around, groaning internally, apparently Tony wasn\u2019t the only\none trying to get you and Carol together.</p><p>You sat\nback down next to Carol but looked ahead instead of at her. Not quite sure\nabout what to do or say, you stuffed your hands under your thighs, something\nCarol knew you did when you were nervous. She turned in her seat so that she\nwas facing you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nsorry,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAbout\nwhat?\u201d you frowned and looked to the side and at her.</p><p>She\nsquirmed a bit in her seat and took a look around, undoubtedly also noticing\nthe various eyes of your teammates.</p><p>\u201cCan we\nmaybe go somewhere where we are alone for a second?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs\neverything alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nCarol breathed out, \u201cI just- I think we should talk.\u201d</p><p>Your heart\npounded, despite what Tony had told you, you couldn\u2019t help your mind from\nwandering. Maybe she found out that you felt more for her than solely\nfriendship and wanted to reject you.</p><p>You still\nsmiled at her. \u201cSure,\u201d you said and got up after her.</p><p>Side by\nside you walked away from the party, a bit further around the lake and away\nfrom Tony\u2019s house. It was more silent here, the music only hardly audible as\nwell as the chatter of the guests.</p><p>Carol\neventually sat down by the water\u2019s edge at a spot where you were hidden by a\nbig tree. You knelt down beside her and after a bit of squirming around settled\nfor sitting cross-legged in front of her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nscaring me, Carol,\u201d you whispered when she didn\u2019t say anything, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d\nshe answered quickly and after hesitating for a second, she reached across from\nher and placed her hand on top of yours and slowly, to give you the chance to\npull away, carded your fingers together. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I said no.\u201d</p><p>You blinked\nsurprised. \u201cBecause of the dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she\nlooked at you guiltily, \u201cI wanted to, I really did, but\u2026\u201d</p><p>She wanted\nto look away, but you didn\u2019t let her, you cupped her face and turned it back\ntowards you.</p><p>\u201cBut what,\nCarol?\u201d</p><p>She inhaled\ndeeply, closing her eyes for a second. \u201cI was afraid of how it might look, I- I\nknow, you didn\u2019t necessarily meant it to be\u2026 romantic, but I would want it to\nbe and I\u2019m just not accustomed to the thought that no-one here would bat an\neye. If we had slow-danced together, back when I, you know, wasn\u2019t yet Captain\nMarvel, it would have been more than just frowned upon. It\u2019s just hard to shake\nthe thought and god, that\u2019s also why I can never bring myself to say a thing,\nbut I really, really like you Y/N. Ever since we met, I\u2019ve felt so close to you\nas I never did with anyone before.\u201d</p><p>You looked\nat her softly, you had stayed silent, afraid that any reaction might cause her\nto stop talking, but now you stood up and smiling you held out your hand for her\nto take.</p><p>\u201cMay I have\nthis dance?\u201d</p><p>Carol\nblinked surprise, but quickly took your hand, letting you pull her up. You\nwrapped your arms around her neck and she rested her hands on your hips, you\nstood so close that you could feel each other\u2019s heartbeats, mixing first and\nthen turning into one.</p><p>You stared\ninto each other\u2019s eyes as you swayed to the distant sound of music, relishing\nthis moment you had alone with the other.</p><p>\u201cI feel the\nsame, you know?\u201d you finally told her too, making the widest smile appear on\nCarol\u2019s face.</p><p>It dropped\nafter a while though, \u201cI don\u2019t think I can be public about this yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\nalright, Carol. We can take all the time you need, as long as I can be with you,\nI don\u2019t care how, but you should know, that no-one here is going to think any\ndifferently of us.\u201d</p><p>Carol\nsmiled and looked at you with utter adoration, but instead of replying\nsomething she simply leaned in. She hesitated half-way, but you didn\u2019t give her\nthe time to pull away and took it upon you to bridge the small remaining gap\nbetween you.</p><p>When your\nlips met hers it was as if fireworks exploded in every nerve of your body, you\nleaned closer to her, deepening the kiss as Carol\u2019s hands left your hips to\ntangle them in your hair. Everything you both had kept locked away the past\nyears, broke free in this kiss as you finally let the other know how much you\nloved them.</p><p>When you\neventually broke apart, both of you breathing heavily and your once so neatly\nmade hair messy, you smiled at each other, both of you not quite able to\ncomprehend your luck.</p><p>\u201cThat was\nlong overdue,\u201d you said, making Carol laugh lightly.</p><p>\u201cIt was,\u201d\nshe agreed and leaned in to give you another short kiss, \u201cI think we should go\nback now, though, before someone goes looking for us.\u201d</p><p>\n\nYou nodded and took her hand as you walked back\nto the party, when you got so close that you were back in visual range, Carol\ngave your hand a light squeeze before letting go. You smiled at her softly,\nletting her know that it was okay that she wasn\u2019t comfortable being too affectionate\nyet. You had time and you couldn\u2019t be happier at the prospect of spending it\nwith Carol.\n\n\n\n</p>",

He looked up when he heard you enter. You quickly gapped the space\nbetween you and wrapped your arms around him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so\nhappy for you, Tony,\u201d you pulled away and smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\nY/N,\u201d the pure joy that sparkled in Tony\u2019s eyes when he answered was something\nyou rarely saw on him, \u201cMind helping me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course\nnot,\u201d you accepted the plates he handed you and walked outside with him again.</p><p>Tony nodded\nover to where Carol was still sitting at the table, now talking with Fury and\nsmirked at you. \u201cHow\u2019s it going with Danvers?\u201d</p><p>You nearly\nlet the plates drop. \u201cWh-What?\u201d</p><p>Your answer\nonly made your friend grin wider. \u201cCome on, you are made for each other\u2026 I\nthought a romantic setting like this would maybe finally get you two to admit your\nfeelings for each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you\ntrying to set us up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just\nwant to help you out,\u201d he nudged your side with his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d\nyou rolled your eyes, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter anyway, because she clearly doesn\u2019t\nlike me like that.\u201d</p><p>Tony\nlaughed, but stopped when he realized your sad expression. \u201cWait, seriously? No\nway, N/N. She\u2019s pining for you just as much as you are pining for her, everyone\ncan see that.\u201d</p><p>You arrived\nat the buffet and set the dishes down but remained standing there with Tony as\nyou kept on talking.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t\nthink she does.\u201d</p><p>You tried\nto hide how much the thought hurt you, but Tony knew you too well, he wrapped\nan arm around your shoulders and pulled you into his side.</p><p>\u201cShe\ndoesn\u2019t even want to dance with me, she said \u2018I don\u2019t dance\u2019 as if we haven\u2019t\nbeen out for karaoke a thousand times with her dancing on table tops, maybe I shouldn\u2019t\nhave asked when there was such a slow song playing\u2026 She looked so uncomfortable\nwhen I asked her, Tony, maybe she isn\u2019t even into girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe\nshe\u2019s just shy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure\nwe\u2019re talking about the same Carol Danvers? Captain Marvel, Ms. \u2018Because before\nyou didn\u2019t have me\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Tony rolled\nhis eyes, \u201cI meant around you, shy about committing to her feelings, not in\ngeneral.\u201d</p><p>You sighed.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\nmaybe you two should just talk with each other, it\u2019s been six years\u2026 It\u2019s my\nwedding, I don\u2019t want to have to worry about one of my best friends pining over\nthe girl of her dreams without acting on her feelings for a second longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d\nyou mumbled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nkidding, Y/N,\u201d he released his grip around your shoulders and started heading\nback to the centre of the party, \u201cBut I swear, if the next time I see you two,\nyou aren\u2019t sucking face, I\u2019m gonna lock you both in a room until you finally\nopen your god damn mouths and talk to each other.\u201d</p><p>He walked\naway before you could answer and left you being not quite sure about whether he\nwas kidding about that too or not.</p><p>Shaking\nyour head you turned back around and your gaze landed yet again on Carol, she\nlooked away quickly, as if she had been caught staring. Fury on the other hand\nnodded over to you and cast a smirk at Carol. As you approached the table he\ngot up, straightening his trademark coat, that he apparently couldn\u2019t even lose\nfor a wedding, and shot you a wink before walking past you.</p><p>You looked\nafter him and saw him join Natasha, who was also looking at you with a light\ngrin. You turned around, groaning internally, apparently Tony wasn\u2019t the only\none trying to get you and Carol together.</p><p>You sat\nback down next to Carol but looked ahead instead of at her. Not quite sure\nabout what to do or say, you stuffed your hands under your thighs, something\nCarol knew you did when you were nervous. She turned in her seat so that she\nwas facing you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nsorry,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAbout\nwhat?\u201d you frowned and looked to the side and at her.</p><p>She\nsquirmed a bit in her seat and took a look around, undoubtedly also noticing\nthe various eyes of your teammates.</p><p>\u201cCan we\nmaybe go somewhere where we are alone for a second?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs\neverything alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nCarol breathed out, \u201cI just- I think we should talk.\u201d</p><p>Your heart\npounded, despite what Tony had told you, you couldn\u2019t help your mind from\nwandering. Maybe she found out that you felt more for her than solely\nfriendship and wanted to reject you.</p><p>You still\nsmiled at her. \u201cSure,\u201d you said and got up after her.</p><p>Side by\nside you walked away from the party, a bit further around the lake and away\nfrom Tony\u2019s house. It was more silent here, the music only hardly audible as\nwell as the chatter of the guests.</p><p>Carol\neventually sat down by the water\u2019s edge at a spot where you were hidden by a\nbig tree. You knelt down beside her and after a bit of squirming around settled\nfor sitting cross-legged in front of her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nscaring me, Carol,\u201d you whispered when she didn\u2019t say anything, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d\nshe answered quickly and after hesitating for a second, she reached across from\nher and placed her hand on top of yours and slowly, to give you the chance to\npull away, carded your fingers together. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I said no.\u201d</p><p>You blinked\nsurprised. \u201cBecause of the dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she\nlooked at you guiltily, \u201cI wanted to, I really did, but\u2026\u201d</p><p>She wanted\nto look away, but you didn\u2019t let her, you cupped her face and turned it back\ntowards you.</p><p>\u201cBut what,\nCarol?\u201d</p><p>She inhaled\ndeeply, closing her eyes for a second. \u201cI was afraid of how it might look, I- I\nknow, you didn\u2019t necessarily meant it to be\u2026 romantic, but I would want it to\nbe and I\u2019m just not accustomed to the thought that no-one here would bat an\neye. If we had slow-danced together, back when I, you know, wasn\u2019t yet Captain\nMarvel, it would have been more than just frowned upon. It\u2019s just hard to shake\nthe thought and god, that\u2019s also why I can never bring myself to say a thing,\nbut I really, really like you Y/N.

Captain Marvel, Ms. \u2018Because before\nyou didn\u2019t have me\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Tony rolled\nhis eyes, \u201cI meant around you, shy about committing to her feelings, not in\ngeneral.\u201d</p><p>You sighed.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\nmaybe you two should just talk with each other, it\u2019s been six years\u2026 It\u2019s my\nwedding, I don\u2019t want to have to worry about one of my best friends pining over\nthe girl of her dreams without acting on her feelings for a second longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d\nyou mumbled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nkidding, Y/N,\u201d he released his grip around your shoulders and started heading\nback to the centre of the party, \u201cBut I swear, if the next time I see you two,\nyou aren\u2019t sucking face, I\u2019m gonna lock you both in a room until you finally\nopen your god damn mouths and talk to each other.\u201d</p><p>He walked\naway before you could answer and left you being not quite sure about whether he\nwas kidding about that too or not.</p><p>Shaking\nyour head you turned back around and your gaze landed yet again on Carol, she\nlooked away quickly, as if she had been caught staring. Fury on the other hand\nnodded over to you and cast a smirk at Carol. As you approached the table he\ngot up, straightening his trademark coat, that he apparently couldn\u2019t even lose\nfor a wedding, and shot you a wink before walking past you.</p><p>You looked\nafter him and saw him join Natasha, who was also looking at you with a light\ngrin. You turned around, groaning internally, apparently Tony wasn\u2019t the only\none trying to get you and Carol together.</p><p>You sat\nback down next to Carol but looked ahead instead of at her. Not quite sure\nabout what to do or say, you stuffed your hands under your thighs, something\nCarol knew you did when you were nervous. She turned in her seat so that she\nwas facing you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nsorry,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAbout\nwhat?\u201d you frowned and looked to the side and at her.</p><p>She\nsquirmed a bit in her seat and took a look around, undoubtedly also noticing\nthe various eyes of your teammates.</p><p>\u201cCan we\nmaybe go somewhere where we are alone for a second?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs\neverything alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nCarol breathed out, \u201cI just- I think we should talk.\u201d</p><p>Your heart\npounded, despite what Tony had told you, you couldn\u2019t help your mind from\nwandering. Maybe she found out that you felt more for her than solely\nfriendship and wanted to reject you.</p><p>You still\nsmiled at her. \u201cSure,\u201d you said and got up after her.</p><p>Side by\nside you walked away from the party, a bit further around the lake and away\nfrom Tony\u2019s house. It was more silent here, the music only hardly audible as\nwell as the chatter of the guests.</p><p>Carol\neventually sat down by the water\u2019s edge at a spot where you were hidden by a\nbig tree. You knelt down beside her and after a bit of squirming around settled\nfor sitting cross-legged in front of her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nscaring me, Carol,\u201d you whispered when she didn\u2019t say anything, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d\nshe answered quickly and after hesitating for a second, she reached across from\nher and placed her hand on top of yours and slowly, to give you the chance to\npull away, carded your fingers together. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I said no.\u201d</p><p>You blinked\nsurprised. \u201cBecause of the dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she\nlooked at you guiltily, \u201cI wanted to, I really did, but\u2026\u201d</p><p>She wanted\nto look away, but you didn\u2019t let her, you cupped her face and turned it back\ntowards you.</p><p>\u201cBut what,\nCarol?\u201d</p><p>She inhaled\ndeeply, closing her eyes for a second. \u201cI was afraid of how it might look, I- I\nknow, you didn\u2019t necessarily meant it to be\u2026 romantic, but I would want it to\nbe and I\u2019m just not accustomed to the thought that no-one here would bat an\neye. If we had slow-danced together, back when I, you know, wasn\u2019t yet Captain\nMarvel, it would have been more than just frowned upon. It\u2019s just hard to shake\nthe thought and god, that\u2019s also why I can never bring myself to say a thing,\nbut I really, really like you Y/N. Ever since we met, I\u2019ve felt so close to you\nas I never did with anyone before.\u201d</p><p>You looked\nat her softly, you had stayed silent, afraid that any reaction might cause her\nto stop talking, but now you stood up and smiling you held out your hand for her\nto take.</p><p>\u201cMay I have\nthis dance?\u201d</p><p>Carol\nblinked surprise, but quickly took your hand, letting you pull her up. You\nwrapped your arms around her neck and she rested her hands on your hips, you\nstood so close that you could feel each other\u2019s heartbeats, mixing first and\nthen turning into one.</p><p>You stared\ninto each other\u2019s eyes as you swayed to the distant sound of music, relishing\nthis moment you had alone with the other.</p><p>\u201cI feel the\nsame, you know?\u201d you finally told her too, making the widest smile appear on\nCarol\u2019s face.</p><p>It dropped\nafter a while though, \u201cI don\u2019t think I can be public about this yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\nalright, Carol. We can take all the time you need, as long as I can be with you,\nI don\u2019t care how, but you should know, that no-one here is going to think any\ndifferently of us.\u201d</p><p>Carol\nsmiled and looked at you with utter adoration, but instead of replying\nsomething she simply leaned in. She hesitated half-way, but you didn\u2019t give her\nthe time to pull away and took it upon you to bridge the small remaining gap\nbetween you.</p><p>When your\nlips met hers it was as if fireworks exploded in every nerve of your body, you\nleaned closer to her, deepening the kiss as Carol\u2019s hands left your hips to\ntangle them in your hair. Everything you both had kept locked away the past\nyears, broke free in this kiss as you finally let the other know how much you\nloved them.</p><p>When you\neventually broke apart, both of you breathing heavily and your once so neatly\nmade hair messy, you smiled at each other, both of you not quite able to\ncomprehend your luck.</p><p>\u201cThat was\nlong overdue,\u201d you said, making Carol laugh lightly.</p><p>\u201cIt was,\u201d\nshe agreed and leaned in to give you another short kiss, \u201cI think we should go\nback now, though, before someone goes looking for us.\u201d</p><p>\n\nYou nodded and took her hand as you walked back\nto the party, when you got so close that you were back in visual range, Carol\ngave your hand a light squeeze before letting go. You smiled at her softly,\nletting her know that it was okay that she wasn\u2019t comfortable being too affectionate\nyet. You had time and you couldn\u2019t be happier at the prospect of spending it\nwith Carol.\n\n\n\n</p></p>",

She was\nbeautiful, she was badass, she was kind&hellip; You were completely enamoured of her.\nAnd yet, you never actually said something about it to her, she liked you too,\nat least so you thought. You spend a lot of time together, talking and laughing\nabout literally anything, but never really flirty, she might just see you as a\nfriend, you thought and &nbsp;today that\nassumption seemed to be proven as true.</p><p>Tony and\nPepper were holding their second wedding to renew their vows now that all the\ndusted had been brought back and Thanos defeated. You and Carol had been seated\nat the same table and she was telling you about a wedding she had once attended\non Hala, you always loved it when she told you about other galaxies and\nplanets, but you never could keep the thought from your mind that there\ncouldn&rsquo;t possibly be someone or something more otherworldly than her.</p><p>You found\nyour gaze trailing down to her lips as she spoke and only noticed what you were\ndoing when Carol cleared her throat.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you\neven listening to me?&rdquo; She gave you a little shove and grinned.</p><p>Flustered\nyou rubbed your neck. &ldquo;Yeah, of course,&rdquo; you finally met her gaze again, &ldquo;I was\njust thinking, would you like to have a dance with me?&rdquo;</p><p>It was only\na dance, you told yourself, not an invitation for a date&hellip; There was absolutely\nno reason for your heart to beat as fast as it did in that moment.</p><p>&ldquo;I- uhm- I\ndon&rsquo;t dance,&rdquo; she evaded your gaze, seeming nervous, panicked even and you\nbrushed it off with a smile, trying to hide your disappointment and excused\nyourself, saying that you should probably find Tony and Pepper anyway to\ncongratulate them.</p><p>In the end\nit was only Tony you found, he was in the kitchen, looking for some extra\ndishes. He looked up when he heard you enter. You quickly gapped the space\nbetween you and wrapped your arms around him.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so\nhappy for you, Tony,&rdquo; you pulled away and smiled at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,\nY/N,&rdquo; the pure joy that sparkled in Tony&rsquo;s eyes when he answered was something\nyou rarely saw on him, &ldquo;Mind helping me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course\nnot,&rdquo; you accepted the plates he handed you and walked outside with him again.</p><p>Tony nodded\nover to where Carol was still sitting at the table, now talking with Fury and\nsmirked at you. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s it going with Danvers?&rdquo;</p><p>You nearly\nlet the plates drop. &ldquo;Wh-What?&rdquo;</p><p>Your answer\nonly made your friend grin wider. &ldquo;Come on, you are made for each other&hellip; I\nthought a romantic setting like this would maybe finally get you two to admit your\nfeelings for each other.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you\ntrying to set us up?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I just\nwant to help you out,&rdquo; he nudged your side with his shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever,&rdquo;\nyou rolled your eyes, &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter anyway, because she clearly doesn&rsquo;t\nlike me like that.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony\nlaughed, but stopped when he realized your sad expression. &ldquo;Wait, seriously?

Brushing your teeth and rinsing out your mouth, you returned to bed and continued the episode.</p><p>The ringing of your phone sent a pinch of pain through your brain and you groaned as you rolled over to answer it. It was your girlfriend. Shit.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; The hoarse sound of your voice made you cringe. And she clearly noticed it was off.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N? Are you okay? You didn&rsquo;t show up for our date tonight. Or yesterday&rsquo;s lunch. What&rsquo;s going on babe?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m disgustingly sick. Doctor says I&rsquo;ve got pneumonia. Sorry I didn&rsquo;t text, my energy has been low lately. And I didn&rsquo;t want to get you sick.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got Kree blood flowing through my veins and I can shoot photon blasts out of my hands. And you&rsquo;re worried about my immune system?&rdquo; She chuckles. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so sweet. But I&rsquo;m coming over.&rdquo;</p><p>Before you could interject she ended the call, so you simply slumped back into bed and continued your marathon. About an episode and a half later there was a knock at the door and a creaking noise as it opened.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/NN?&rdquo; Her voice was so soft as she peeked around the corner and into your room, her arms full of grocery bags. &ldquo;I bring food and necessities.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Necessities?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yep. I&rsquo;ve got a mask for me to wear so you worry less, and few boxes of tissues. Also a little garbage can that you can use and some mints to help get rid of the aftertaste when you, you know.&rdquo; She pulls out object after object and you can&rsquo;t help but melt at the thought of her out in a store scanning aisles for things to make you feel better.</p><p>&ldquo;Carol&hellip; you didn&rsquo;t have to do that.&rdquo; She holds up a hand, shaking her head as she removes everything from the bags.</p><p>&ldquo;But I wanted to.&rdquo; She hands you a bowl of fruit and a box of tissues, wrapping you in a blanket and pulling up a chair. Carol sits in the chair beside your bed and watches Netflix with you, helping when you feel nauseous another wave of nausea.</p><p>She stays, the entire time you&rsquo;re sick. Always ready to jump into action if you ran low on something or needed any help. You were honestly just glad that she was there, her presence alone was enough.</p><p>When you were better you took her to breakfast and lunch, and cooked her dinner to thank her for all her help. You were currently washing the dishes of said dinner as she packed away the leftovers and cleared the table. </p><p>After you finally finished you find her scanning your movie collection, deep in thought. You spin her around and wrap your arms around her, pressing a light kiss to her lips. </p><p>You had been desperate to be close to her after so long of not being able to touch her and feeling absolutely horrid. Honestly, you just wanted to be with your girlfriend after all that. You wanted to feel good and be happy. To forget the sickness. And you knew just what to do.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe we just skip the movie?&rdquo; A smirk tugged at your lips and hers.</p><p>&ldquo;Hmmm. Maybe we do.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>~</p><p>Please let me know if you&rsquo;d like to join any tags!
