If deepwood motte wasn\u2019t already attacked by the white walkers (which I am almost certain it didn\u2019t), I think Robett Glover will come into play. Jon being the rightful heir to the iron throne Sansa can use this info and have Glover aid her, as he never pledged to fight for a Targaryen (Danny) as we read from the scroll from s8x01, but before he did say \u201cThere will be more fights to come; House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousand years, and I will stand behind Jon Snow, the King in the North!\u201d He refused to fight the White Walkers war cuz Jon bent the knee to Dany, but now it\u2019s a different story. If Danny wins, it won\u2019t look so good for him either. I believe him and his troops will surely fight this time. I mean after the living won at Winterfell, he is most likely be a powerful lord in the north rn and we clearly know that he thought highly of Sansa being in charge when Jon had left. I think Sansa probably sent Arya to do that on her way. I mean something is going through Sansa\u2019s mind! She is not gonna just stand there and watch bc whether Danny/Cersei wins they were both are a threat to the North. Plus, it only seems right that Sansa is the one to take down Cersei. She took down Ramsey and Littlefinger herself so why not her take down her biggest enemy herself!

All her time with Littlefinger and Cersei taught her a lot, which might just save them all. This was never going to be kept a secret, speaking from a viewer\u2019s perspective it is just too important for the plot and (unpopular opinion) I love that Sansa took control of the situation. She could have done much worse than telling Tyrion, it was a calculated choice and a great one at that",

Yes, she broke a promise she made to Jon but Varys is right, Dany is too strong for Jon. She bends him to her will too easily. Jon NEEDS Sansa fighting his corner because she\u2019s got the brains and the ability to make difficult decisions for him, and she can see clearly where he cannot.</p>",

I mean I get why she doesn't like her but I really feel like they're destroying her character development... I love her and I truly think she's more than that. They're turning them all in these dumb pawns in Dany-Jon-Cercei game and it's annoying.",
        "answer": "<p>I completely disagree with you and I will defend her to the goddamned core of the earth. Dany rode into Winterfell with her armies and her dragons and condescended to Sansa like she was a child, refused to recognise the north as an independent nation once she won the seven kingdoms and proved herself willing to ride her battle-weary, injured armies and dragons down south just so she could sit on a throne. Daenerys expects special praise for offering those armies and dragons to the war against the White Walkers as if it wasn\u2019t her war to fight, when as the \u2018queen of Westeros\u2019 she ought have offered those numbers because it is her job to protect her people. Sansa got the measure of her far better than Jon did. She knows that he can\u2019t see Daenerys clearly because of his feelings for her.</p><p>With all of that in mind, if you were the Lady of Winterfell, how would you be able to rest for worry that your king and brother had not only bent the knee to this woman, but fallen in love with her, too? She is fighting tooth and nail and using every maneuver she can think of to protect her family and her people from Daenerys, and she\u2019s thinking so far ahead of the rest of them all that she\u2019s basically playing chess while they\u2019re all stuck on checkers. How anyone could think that she is \u2018one-dimensional\u2019 is absolutely beyond me. Sansa is the absolute best of them. Arya has complete faith in her intelligence for a reason.</p>",
