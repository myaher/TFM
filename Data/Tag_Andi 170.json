It\u2019s Amber\u2019s eighteenth birthday and somehow, using means unknown to anyone else, she managed to convince her parents to disappear for a weekend so she could celebrate with her friends. The house is full of people he recognises from other parties Andi and Amber have dragged them all to in the past. People shoot him smiles and greetings as he weaves his way through the halls. He just finished work an hour ago, so he had to drive himself here and he hadn\u2019t had much time to get ready, but he didn\u2019t want to show up too late. Andi and Jonah baked a cake that\u2019s the size of a rather large baby and he can\u2019t wait to see Amber\u2019s face when they surprise her with it.</p><p>He heads for the kitchen first because that\u2019s usually where he finds his friends on night\u2019s like this, but when he gets there it\u2019s crowded with people watching a guy tip upside down to do a keg stand. Cyrus raises himself on to his tiptoes to scan over everybody\u2019s heads and see if he can spot TJ, and that\u2019s when one of the drunk guys standing by the door notices him.</p><p>\u201cOh, hey man. It\u2019s Cyrus, right? You looking for your boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy boyfriend?\u201d Cyrus asks, baffled. The guy must take that more as a confirmation than a question because he just nods with a big goofy grin and points his beer towards the doors to the yard.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cHe was out on the deck last I saw. I think your other friends are playing beer pong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d he replies, grateful he doesn\u2019t have to track everyone down by himself now. \u201cThanks, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem!\u201d The dude says, then turns his attention back to the keg.</p><p>Cyrus heads outside, ducking and weaving through various partygoers. He grabs a bottle of beer on his way out - he can drink tonight. Amber said they could all stay over so they don\u2019t have drive home. The bass boosted music pounding in the house changes to something more chill when he steps outside, and he realises they must have two different sound systems set up. The yard\u2019s been decorated with endless strings of fairy lights, cheesy pink birthday streamers and banners that read \u2018HAPPY BIRTHDAY\u2019. It\u2019s a typical Amber-explosion of an event. Cyrus is filled with an overwhelming feeling of fondness as he takes it all in.</p><p>True to the drunk guy\u2019s word, he finds his friends out playing beer pong by the pool. He actually hears them before he sees them; loud raucous laughter and teasing smack talk being thrown back and forth. It\u2019s Jonah and Walker versus Buffy and Marty while Amber, Andi, TJ and Iris laze on the sunloungers watching in amusement as the others get increasingly competitive.</p><p>\u201cCyrus!\u201d Amber greets him enthusiastically. He draws him into a tight hug.</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday,\u201d He laughs. She moves with the wobbling grace of someone tipsy on their way to drunk. \u201cYou\u2019re having a good time then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best time!\u201d</p><p>She releases him and he\u2019s pulled into a cluster of back patting hugs and fist bumps by the others. He turns to TJ last and grins up at him.</p><p>\u201cUnderdog,\u201d TJ greets him, ruffling his hair. \u201cYou got a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Cyrus waves the beer at him, then realises he doesn\u2019t have a bottle opener. TJ seems to realise the same thing, and he claps him on the back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go grab something to open that,\u201d He says. \u201cBe right back.\u201d</p><p>They watch him go as he jogs back up the steps to the kitchen and disappears inside.</p><p>\u201cMust be nice to have your own personal butler,\u201d Buffy teases, wiggling her eyebrow. \u201cI wish Marty cared about me that much.\u201d She\u2019s been making those sorts of jokes a lot lately. Everyone has. It seems everyone has a comment on how he and TJ behave around each other, which is odd because Cyrus doesn\u2019t see anything different in their interactions to how they\u2019ve always been.</p><p>He rolls his eyes. \u201cStop. I don\u2019t know why you keep insinuating there\u2019s something going on between us\u2026 it\u2019s weird. You know a guy inside called TJ my boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>Andi snorts. \u201cYeah, \u2018cause he basically is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please,\u201d Iris chimes in. \u201cHave you seen the way that boy looks at you? He\u2019s crazy about you. You\u2019re not much better with him, either. Everyone thinks you\u2019re together because you both act like you are.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus splutters. \u201cWe do not. We\u2019re friends.\u201d</p><p>Jonah makes a loud disbelieving noise. Cyrus turns to look at him with a raised eyebrow and he shrugs.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Friends\u2019 don\u2019t run to grab each other bottle openers without being asked, bro,\u201d he points out. \u201cThat\u2019s purely a Cyrus-And-TJ thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd \u2018friends\u2019 don\u2019t have entire conversations with their eyes,\u201d Marty laughs. \u201cSometimes I think you guys are like\u2026 telepathic or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Friends\u2019 also don\u2019t constantly lend each other their jackets when the other looks cold,\u201d Buffy says.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t do that that often,\u201d Cyrus defends himself.</p><p>The others chorus, \u201c\u2018That often\u2019.\u201d</p><p>The conversation is interrupted by TJ\u2019s return. He takes Cyrus\u2019 beer from him and opens the bottle easily before handing it back. Their friends shoot Cyrus meaningful looks over his shoulder. He elects to ignore them. Eventually, the others get back into their intense game of beer bong and Cyrus settles next to TJ on one of the sun loungers to talk to Iris. He has a little trouble completely focusing on the conversation, though, because he\u2019s now distracted by what the others had said.</p><p>Do he and TJ really behave like a couple that much? He\u2019s hyper-aware of their shoulders and knees pressed together and that\u2019s how he realises how close they\u2019re sitting to one another. Maybe if they were just friends they\u2019d sit further apart. He\u2019s unsure\u2026 he hasn\u2019t thought about how close he sits to people before. He and TJ have always sat this close when they\u2019re together. It\u2019s nice. It\u2019s comforting. Is it really that unusual to want to be close to your friends? TJ brushes a bit of glitter from Cyrus\u2019 cheek while joking with Iris about something that happened at the gym earlier in the week. Does TJ touch him like that a lot too? Casual affection is normal, isn\u2019t it? Cyrus has always felt comfortable exchanging little touches with TJ. He likes it when TJ ruffles his hair or places his hands gently on Cyrus\u2019 waist to move him out the way sometimes or when they cuddle during movie nights. They\u2019re just close. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that.</p><p>He watches as TJ laughs at something Iris says and it hits him all at once. He thinks about how he gets distracted when other people mention TJ\u2019s name in conversation, about how he could talk about TJ for days if he wanted. He thinks about all the times TJ has called him at two am for no particular reason, just because he felt like saying hi, and the conversations that often lasted for hours afterwards. He thinks about the number of times he\u2019s told TJ off for cancelling other plans just to hang out with him, and how many times TJ\u2019s argued with him about Cyrus deliberately ordering food he knows TJ will like instead of just food for him when they\u2019re out. He thinks about picking croutons out of TJ\u2019s salads while TJ takes his olives. Memories of TJ turning up the radio when one of Cyrus\u2019 favourite songs came on in the car floor his thoughts. They spend all their time together. Cyrus knows TJ like the back of his own hand and he\u2019s pretty sure TJ knows him just as well. He misses him when he isn\u2019t around.</p><p>He wonders how he missed all of this before it was pointed out to him.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cHey, you okay?\u201d TJ asks later when it\u2019s just the two of them left by the pool. The girls left to dance in the living room and Jonah dragged the guys off to challenge more people to dumb drinking games. Cyrus has his shoes off and his feet in the water, leaning back against TJ\u2019s knees. \u201cYou\u2019ve been quiet tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I? Oh. Just tired from work, I guess,\u201d Cyrus says, sheepishly.</p><p>TJ leans forward and runs a hand through his hair. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus means to say \u2018I\u2019m fine\u2019 and carry on like normal, but he\u2019s had a few drinks now and his lips weren\u2019t that tightly sealed to begin with, so what spills out instead is \u201cAre we more than friends?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a moment of silence and TJ drops his hand away. Cyrus wonders if he\u2019s just ruined several years of friendship in a sentence because he was too dumb to keep his mouth shut.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to be?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus twists around to face him. TJ\u2019s looking back at him with a blank expression carefully crafted on his face. Unfortunately for him, Cyrus knows that that face means he\u2019s currently dealing with emotions he doesn\u2019t know how to express verbally.</p><p>\u201cI think I do,\u201d Cyrus admits quietly. \u201cI think maybe we\u2019ve been on the verge of more than friends for a while now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made you bring it up now, then?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cI guess\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I guess I just realised how much I miss you when you\u2019re not around. I kind of want to be around you all the time.</p><p>There\u2019s another moment of worrying silence, and then TJ speaks.</p><p>\u201cYou know I want to tell you everything all the time,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything that happens in my day, big or small, I want to talk to you about it. Usually, that\u2019s what I end up doing. And when I see something cute in a shop window, or one of the kids does something funny at work, the first person I think of is always you because I\u2019m thinking \u2018man, Cyrus would love this\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTJ-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat time you went to the hospital because you broke your ankle?\u201d TJ continues, putting a hand up to indicate Cyrus shouldn\u2019t interrupt him. \u201cWhen Buffy told me what happened I almost threw up I was so worried about you.\u201d</p><p>You drew roses on my cast, Cyrus thinks fondly.</p><p>\u201cAnd the swingset is my favourite place in the whole world now, probably, \u2018cause I know when I go there you\u2019ve got my back. Every. Single. Time. And I\u2019ve got yours. You always listen. You\u2019ve never judged me. You\u2019re the only one who ever really encourages me to do better. I\u2019m a better person when I\u2019m with you. So\u2026 yeah, I think we\u2019re more than friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I speak now?\u201d</p><p>TJ nods.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank God,\u201d TJ leans in close, and tips Cyrus\u2019 face up with a gentle finger to look him in the eye. \u201cI was worried it was just me.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiles into the kiss. It\u2019s the best party he\u2019s ever been to in his life.</p>",

The guy must take that more as a confirmation than a question because he just nods with a big goofy grin and points his beer towards the doors to the yard.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cHe was out on the deck last I saw. I think your other friends are playing beer pong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d he replies, grateful he doesn\u2019t have to track everyone down by himself now. \u201cThanks, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem!\u201d The dude says, then turns his attention back to the keg.</p><p>Cyrus heads outside, ducking and weaving through various partygoers. He grabs a bottle of beer on his way out - he can drink tonight. Amber said they could all stay over so they don\u2019t have drive home. The bass boosted music pounding in the house changes to something more chill when he steps outside, and he realises they must have two different sound systems set up. The yard\u2019s been decorated with endless strings of fairy lights, cheesy pink birthday streamers and banners that read \u2018HAPPY BIRTHDAY\u2019. It\u2019s a typical Amber-explosion of an event. Cyrus is filled with an overwhelming feeling of fondness as he takes it all in.</p><p>True to the drunk guy\u2019s word, he finds his friends out playing beer pong by the pool. He actually hears them before he sees them; loud raucous laughter and teasing smack talk being thrown back and forth. It\u2019s Jonah and Walker versus Buffy and Marty while Amber, Andi, TJ and Iris laze on the sunloungers watching in amusement as the others get increasingly competitive.</p><p>\u201cCyrus!\u201d Amber greets him enthusiastically. He draws him into a tight hug.</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday,\u201d He laughs. She moves with the wobbling grace of someone tipsy on their way to drunk. \u201cYou\u2019re having a good time then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best time!\u201d</p><p>She releases him and he\u2019s pulled into a cluster of back patting hugs and fist bumps by the others. He turns to TJ last and grins up at him.</p><p>\u201cUnderdog,\u201d TJ greets him, ruffling his hair. \u201cYou got a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Cyrus waves the beer at him, then realises he doesn\u2019t have a bottle opener. TJ seems to realise the same thing, and he claps him on the back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go grab something to open that,\u201d He says. \u201cBe right back.\u201d</p><p>They watch him go as he jogs back up the steps to the kitchen and disappears inside.</p><p>\u201cMust be nice to have your own personal butler,\u201d Buffy teases, wiggling her eyebrow. \u201cI wish Marty cared about me that much.\u201d She\u2019s been making those sorts of jokes a lot lately. Everyone has. It seems everyone has a comment on how he and TJ behave around each other, which is odd because Cyrus doesn\u2019t see anything different in their interactions to how they\u2019ve always been.</p><p>He rolls his eyes. \u201cStop. I don\u2019t know why you keep insinuating there\u2019s something going on between us\u2026 it\u2019s weird. You know a guy inside called TJ my boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>Andi snorts. \u201cYeah, \u2018cause he basically is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please,\u201d Iris chimes in. \u201cHave you seen the way that boy looks at you? He\u2019s crazy about you. You\u2019re not much better with him, either. Everyone thinks you\u2019re together because you both act like you are.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus splutters. \u201cWe do not. We\u2019re friends.\u201d</p><p>Jonah makes a loud disbelieving noise. Cyrus turns to look at him with a raised eyebrow and he shrugs.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Friends\u2019 don\u2019t run to grab each other bottle openers without being asked, bro,\u201d he points out. \u201cThat\u2019s purely a Cyrus-And-TJ thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd \u2018friends\u2019 don\u2019t have entire conversations with their eyes,\u201d Marty laughs. \u201cSometimes I think you guys are like\u2026 telepathic or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Friends\u2019 also don\u2019t constantly lend each other their jackets when the other looks cold,\u201d Buffy says.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t do that that often,\u201d Cyrus defends himself.</p><p>The others chorus, \u201c\u2018That often\u2019.\u201d</p><p>The conversation is interrupted by TJ\u2019s return. He takes Cyrus\u2019 beer from him and opens the bottle easily before handing it back. Their friends shoot Cyrus meaningful looks over his shoulder. He elects to ignore them. Eventually, the others get back into their intense game of beer bong and Cyrus settles next to TJ on one of the sun loungers to talk to Iris. He has a little trouble completely focusing on the conversation, though, because he\u2019s now distracted by what the others had said.</p><p>Do he and TJ really behave like a couple that much? He\u2019s hyper-aware of their shoulders and knees pressed together and that\u2019s how he realises how close they\u2019re sitting to one another. Maybe if they were just friends they\u2019d sit further apart. He\u2019s unsure\u2026 he hasn\u2019t thought about how close he sits to people before. He and TJ have always sat this close when they\u2019re together. It\u2019s nice. It\u2019s comforting. Is it really that unusual to want to be close to your friends? TJ brushes a bit of glitter from Cyrus\u2019 cheek while joking with Iris about something that happened at the gym earlier in the week. Does TJ touch him like that a lot too? Casual affection is normal, isn\u2019t it? Cyrus has always felt comfortable exchanging little touches with TJ. He likes it when TJ ruffles his hair or places his hands gently on Cyrus\u2019 waist to move him out the way sometimes or when they cuddle during movie nights. They\u2019re just close. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that.</p><p>He watches as TJ laughs at something Iris says and it hits him all at once. He thinks about how he gets distracted when other people mention TJ\u2019s name in conversation, about how he could talk about TJ for days if he wanted. He thinks about all the times TJ has called him at two am for no particular reason, just because he felt like saying hi, and the conversations that often lasted for hours afterwards. He thinks about the number of times he\u2019s told TJ off for cancelling other plans just to hang out with him, and how many times TJ\u2019s argued with him about Cyrus deliberately ordering food he knows TJ will like instead of just food for him when they\u2019re out. He thinks about picking croutons out of TJ\u2019s salads while TJ takes his olives. Memories of TJ turning up the radio when one of Cyrus\u2019 favourite songs came on in the car floor his thoughts. They spend all their time together. Cyrus knows TJ like the back of his own hand and he\u2019s pretty sure TJ knows him just as well. He misses him when he isn\u2019t around.</p><p>He wonders how he missed all of this before it was pointed out to him.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cHey, you okay?\u201d TJ asks later when it\u2019s just the two of them left by the pool. The girls left to dance in the living room and Jonah dragged the guys off to challenge more people to dumb drinking games. Cyrus has his shoes off and his feet in the water, leaning back against TJ\u2019s knees. \u201cYou\u2019ve been quiet tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I? Oh. Just tired from work, I guess,\u201d Cyrus says, sheepishly.</p><p>TJ leans forward and runs a hand through his hair. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus means to say \u2018I\u2019m fine\u2019 and carry on like normal, but he\u2019s had a few drinks now and his lips weren\u2019t that tightly sealed to begin with, so what spills out instead is \u201cAre we more than friends?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a moment of silence and TJ drops his hand away. Cyrus wonders if he\u2019s just ruined several years of friendship in a sentence because he was too dumb to keep his mouth shut.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to be?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus twists around to face him. TJ\u2019s looking back at him with a blank expression carefully crafted on his face. Unfortunately for him, Cyrus knows that that face means he\u2019s currently dealing with emotions he doesn\u2019t know how to express verbally.</p><p>\u201cI think I do,\u201d Cyrus admits quietly. \u201cI think maybe we\u2019ve been on the verge of more than friends for a while now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made you bring it up now, then?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cI guess\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I guess I just realised how much I miss you when you\u2019re not around. I kind of want to be around you all the time.</p><p>There\u2019s another moment of worrying silence, and then TJ speaks.</p><p>\u201cYou know I want to tell you everything all the time,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything that happens in my day, big or small, I want to talk to you about it. Usually, that\u2019s what I end up doing. And when I see something cute in a shop window, or one of the kids does something funny at work, the first person I think of is always you because I\u2019m thinking \u2018man, Cyrus would love this\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTJ-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat time you went to the hospital because you broke your ankle?\u201d TJ continues, putting a hand up to indicate Cyrus shouldn\u2019t interrupt him. \u201cWhen Buffy told me what happened I almost threw up I was so worried about you.\u201d</p><p>You drew roses on my cast, Cyrus thinks fondly.</p><p>\u201cAnd the swingset is my favourite place in the whole world now, probably, \u2018cause I know when I go there you\u2019ve got my back. Every. Single. Time. And I\u2019ve got yours. You always listen. You\u2019ve never judged me. You\u2019re the only one who ever really encourages me to do better. I\u2019m a better person when I\u2019m with you. So\u2026 yeah, I think we\u2019re more than friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I speak now?\u201d</p><p>TJ nods.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank God,\u201d TJ leans in close, and tips Cyrus\u2019 face up with a gentle finger to look him in the eye. \u201cI was worried it was just me.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiles into the kiss. It\u2019s the best party he\u2019s ever been to in his life.</p></p>",

It\u2019s Amber\u2019s eighteenth birthday and somehow, using means unknown to anyone else, she managed to convince her parents to disappear for a weekend so she could celebrate with her friends. The house is full of people he recognises from other parties Andi and Amber have dragged them all to in the past. People shoot him smiles and greetings as he weaves his way through the halls. He just finished work an hour ago, so he had to drive himself here and he hadn\u2019t had much time to get ready, but he didn\u2019t want to show up too late. Andi and Jonah baked a cake that\u2019s the size of a rather large baby and he can\u2019t wait to see Amber\u2019s face when they surprise her with it.</p><p>He heads for the kitchen first because that\u2019s usually where he finds his friends on night\u2019s like this, but when he gets there it\u2019s crowded with people watching a guy tip upside down to do a keg stand. Cyrus raises himself on to his tiptoes to scan over everybody\u2019s heads and see if he can spot TJ, and that\u2019s when one of the drunk guys standing by the door notices him.</p><p>\u201cOh, hey man. It\u2019s Cyrus, right? You looking for your boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy boyfriend?\u201d Cyrus asks, baffled. The guy must take that more as a confirmation than a question because he just nods with a big goofy grin and points his beer towards the doors to the yard.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cHe was out on the deck last I saw.

He grabs a bottle of beer on his way out - he can drink tonight. Amber said they could all stay over so they don\u2019t have drive home. The bass boosted music pounding in the house changes to something more chill when he steps outside, and he realises they must have two different sound systems set up.

It&rsquo;s Amber&rsquo;s eighteenth birthday and somehow, using means unknown to anyone else, she managed to convince her parents to disappear for a weekend so she could celebrate with her friends. The house is full of people he recognises from other parties Andi and Amber have dragged them all to in the past. People shoot him smiles and greetings as he weaves his way through the halls. He just finished work an hour ago, so he had to drive himself here and he hadn&rsquo;t had much time to get ready, but he didn&rsquo;t want to show up too late. Andi and Jonah baked a cake that&rsquo;s the size of a rather large baby and he can&rsquo;t wait to see Amber&rsquo;s face when they surprise her with it.</p><p>He heads for the kitchen first because that&rsquo;s usually where he finds his friends on night&rsquo;s like this, but when he gets there it&rsquo;s crowded with people watching a guy tip upside down to do a keg stand. Cyrus raises himself on to his tiptoes to scan over everybody&rsquo;s heads and see if he can spot TJ, and that&rsquo;s when one of the drunk guys standing by the door notices him.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, hey man. It&rsquo;s Cyrus, right? You looking for your boyfriend?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My boyfriend?&rdquo; Cyrus asks, baffled. The guy must take that more as a confirmation than a question because he just nods with a big goofy grin and points his beer towards the doors to the yard.</p><p>&ldquo;He was out on the deck last I saw. I think your other friends are playing beer pong.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cool,&rdquo; he replies, grateful he doesn&rsquo;t have to track everyone down by himself now. &ldquo;Thanks, man.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No problem!&rdquo; The dude says, then turns his attention back to the keg.</p><p>Cyrus heads outside, ducking and weaving through various partygoers. He grabs a bottle of beer on his way out - he can drink tonight. Amber said they could all stay over so they don&rsquo;t have drive home. The bass boosted music pounding in the house changes to something more chill when he steps outside, and he realises they must have two different sound systems set up. The yard&rsquo;s been decorated with endless strings of fairy lights, cheesy pink birthday streamers and banners that read &lsquo;HAPPY BIRTHDAY&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s a typical Amber-explosion of an event. Cyrus is filled with an overwhelming feeling of fondness as he takes it all in.</p><p>True to the drunk guy&rsquo;s word, he finds his friends out playing beer pong by the pool. He actually hears them before he sees them; loud raucous laughter and teasing smack talk being thrown back and forth. It&rsquo;s Jonah and Walker versus Buffy and Marty while Amber, Andi, TJ and Iris laze on the sunloungers watching in amusement as the others get increasingly competitive.</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus!&rdquo; Amber greets him enthusiastically. He draws him into a tight hug.</p><p>&ldquo;Happy birthday,&rdquo; He laughs. She moves with the wobbling grace of someone tipsy on their way to drunk. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re having a good time then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The best time!&rdquo;</p><p>She releases him and he&rsquo;s pulled into a cluster of back patting hugs and fist bumps by the others. He turns to TJ last and grins up at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Underdog,&rdquo; TJ greets him, ruffling his hair. &ldquo;You got a drink?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; Cyrus waves the beer at him, then realises he doesn&rsquo;t have a bottle opener. TJ seems to realise the same thing, and he claps him on the back.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go grab something to open that,&rdquo; He says. &ldquo;Be right back.&rdquo;</p><p>They watch him go as he jogs back up the steps to the kitchen and disappears inside.</p><p>&ldquo;Must be nice to have your own personal butler,&rdquo; Buffy teases, wiggling her eyebrow. &ldquo;I wish Marty cared about me that much.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s been making those sorts of jokes a lot lately. Everyone has. It seems everyone has a comment on how he and TJ behave around each other, which is odd because Cyrus doesn&rsquo;t see anything different in their interactions to how they&rsquo;ve always been.</p><p>He rolls his eyes. &ldquo;Stop. I don&rsquo;t know why you keep insinuating there&rsquo;s something going on between us&hellip; it&rsquo;s weird. You know a guy inside called TJ my boyfriend?&rdquo;</p><p>Andi snorts. &ldquo;Yeah, &lsquo;cause he basically is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He is not!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, please,&rdquo; Iris chimes in. &ldquo;Have you seen the way that boy looks at you? He&rsquo;s crazy about you. You&rsquo;re not much better with him, either. Everyone thinks you&rsquo;re together because you both act like you are.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus splutters. &ldquo;We do not. We&rsquo;re friends.&rdquo;</p><p>Jonah makes a loud disbelieving noise. Cyrus turns to look at him with a raised eyebrow and he shrugs.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Friends&rsquo; don&rsquo;t run to grab each other bottle openers without being asked, bro,&rdquo; he points out. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s purely a Cyrus-And-TJ thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And &lsquo;friends&rsquo; don&rsquo;t have entire conversations with their eyes,&rdquo; Marty laughs. &ldquo;Sometimes I think you guys are like&hellip; telepathic or something.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Friends&rsquo; also don&rsquo;t constantly lend each other their jackets when the other looks cold,&rdquo; Buffy says.</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t do that that often,&rdquo; Cyrus defends himself.</p><p>The others chorus, &ldquo;&lsquo;That often&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>The conversation is interrupted by TJ&rsquo;s return. He takes Cyrus&rsquo; beer from him and opens the bottle easily before handing it back. Their friends shoot Cyrus meaningful looks over his shoulder. He elects to ignore them. Eventually, the others get back into their intense game of beer bong and Cyrus settles next to TJ on one of the sun loungers to talk to Iris. He has a little trouble completely focusing on the conversation, though, because he&rsquo;s now distracted by what the others had said.</p><p>Do he and TJ really behave like a couple that much? He&rsquo;s hyper-aware of their shoulders and knees pressed together and that&rsquo;s how he realises how close they&rsquo;re sitting to one another. Maybe if they were just friends they&rsquo;d sit further apart. He&rsquo;s unsure&hellip; he hasn&rsquo;t thought about how close he sits to people before. He and TJ have always sat this close when they&rsquo;re together. It&rsquo;s nice. It&rsquo;s comforting. Is it really that unusual to want to be close to your friends? TJ brushes a bit of glitter from Cyrus&rsquo; cheek while joking with Iris about something that happened at the gym earlier in the week. Does TJ touch him like that a lot too? Casual affection is normal, isn&rsquo;t it? Cyrus has always felt comfortable exchanging little touches with TJ. He likes it when TJ ruffles his hair or places his hands gently on Cyrus&rsquo; waist to move him out the way sometimes or when they cuddle during movie nights. They&rsquo;re just close. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that.</p><p>He watches as TJ laughs at something Iris says and it hits him all at once. He thinks about how he gets distracted when other people mention TJ&rsquo;s name in conversation, about how he could talk about TJ for days if he wanted. He thinks about all the times TJ has called him at two am for no particular reason, just because he felt like saying hi, and the conversations that often lasted for hours afterwards. He thinks about the number of times he&rsquo;s told TJ off for cancelling other plans just to hang out with him, and how many times TJ&rsquo;s argued with him about Cyrus deliberately ordering food he knows TJ will like instead of just food for him when they&rsquo;re out. He thinks about picking croutons out of TJ&rsquo;s salads while TJ takes his olives. Memories of TJ turning up the radio when one of Cyrus&rsquo; favourite songs came on in the car floor his thoughts. They spend all their time together. Cyrus knows TJ like the back of his own hand and he&rsquo;s pretty sure TJ knows him just as well. He misses him when he isn&rsquo;t around.</p><p>He wonders how he missed all of this before it was pointed out to him.</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, you okay?&rdquo; TJ asks later when it&rsquo;s just the two of them left by the pool. The girls left to dance in the living room and Jonah dragged the guys off to challenge more people to dumb drinking games. Cyrus has his shoes off and his feet in the water, leaning back against TJ&rsquo;s knees. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been quiet tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have I? Oh. Just tired from work, I guess,&rdquo; Cyrus says, sheepishly.</p><p>TJ leans forward and runs a hand through his hair. &ldquo;You sure?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus means to say &lsquo;I&rsquo;m fine&rsquo; and carry on like normal, but he&rsquo;s had a few drinks now and his lips weren&rsquo;t that tightly sealed to begin with, so what spills out instead is &ldquo;Are we more than friends?&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s a moment of silence and TJ drops his hand away. Cyrus wonders if he&rsquo;s just ruined several years of friendship in a sentence because he was too dumb to keep his mouth shut.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to be?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus twists around to face him. TJ&rsquo;s looking back at him with a blank expression carefully crafted on his face. Unfortunately for him, Cyrus knows that that face means he&rsquo;s currently dealing with emotions he doesn&rsquo;t know how to express verbally.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I do,&rdquo; Cyrus admits quietly. &ldquo;I think maybe we&rsquo;ve been on the verge of more than friends for a while now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What made you bring it up now, then?&rdquo;</p><p>He shrugs. &ldquo;I guess&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know. I guess I just realised how much I miss you when you&rsquo;re not around. I kind of want to be around you all the time.</p><p>There&rsquo;s another moment of worrying silence, and then TJ speaks.</p><p>&ldquo;You know I want to tell you everything all the time,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Everything that happens in my day, big or small, I want to talk to you about it.

Do you think he'd struggle with any conflict/try and hide his relationship with Cyrus in the closet (school sports are still so full of toxic masculinity) like being captain seems to be one of the few things  (besides) Cyrus that makes him happy. I know it's meant to be a more optimistic show but I feel it's something I wish the show could have dealt with. How do you think he'd overcome the issues relating to this?",

Unless his teammates are known homophobes. In that case he\u2019d intentionally hide it for his own safety. </p><p>And honestly, he might just resort to beating anyone up that\u2019s teasing him or Cyrus for being gay. Then people would be sure not to mess with him. </p><p>Also I agree with you, it\u2019d be interesting for the show to tackle mild homophobia (nothing too serious though cuz triggers and stuff) but unfortunately there\u2019s no way Disney would draw that much attention to their gay characters.

        "answer": "<h2><a href=\"http://CAPTAINKIPPEN.TUMBLR.COM\">SEND ME FIC PROMPTS</a></h2><p><b>Thank you so much!</b></p><hr><p>Cyrus couldn\u2019t bite back a smile as he picked up the incoming call from TJ. He knew exactly what this conversation was going to be because TJ was almost half an hour late to meet him now.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d He sung into the phone.</p><p>TJ\u2019s was tinny and crackled through the phone, but the annoyance in his tone came through clear as day. <i>\u201cI know. Your campus is like one big maze. I\u2019ve been walking in circles for like an hour now.\u201d</i></p><!-- more --><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just text me to come find you?\u201d He knew why. It was because TJ was as stubborn as they come and unwilling to ask for help most of the time, especially when it came to directions. He had this weird attitude towards maps that suggested he knew better than them, but really Cyrus was pretty sure he just found them too confusing. Even with Google maps telling them out loud where to go TJ has gotten lost before. It was a talent of his.</p><p><i>\u201cI thought I had it down,\u201d</i> TJ grumbled. \u201cWhy is nothing here signposted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Cyrus grabbed his keys from the top of his dresser and slipped on some shoes. \u201cDescribe your location, I\u2019m coming to find you.\u201d</p><hr><p>It took Cyrus ten minutes to find TJ. Fortunately, he was only a little way across campus rather than lost somewhere down near Greek Row or the library. From a distance, he looked grumpy, but as Cyrus walked towards him he lifted his head and a smile blossomed across his face when he spotted him. Cyrus forced himself not to run towards him, just walking at a slightly higher than average speed, but somehow they still managed to collide so hard that the force of their hug almost winded both of them.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Cyrus sighed happily into TJ\u2019s chest. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you too,\u201d TJ mumbled, pressing a kiss to the top of his head. \u201cI hate being far away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sucks,\u201d He pulled back to stretch up and give TJ a quick kiss. It took all his strength not to real him in for a proper one, but there was a time and a place for that and he didn\u2019t want any of his professors to witness him practically mauling his boyfriend. \u201cHow was the drive?\u201d</p><p>He pulled away and TJ bent down to pick up the duffle bag by his feet. The sight of the bag made Cyrus incredibly happy. It was an old one, the one that TJ had always used to use for camping, but now it signified special weekends visiting one another or trips down to the lake when they were back at home.</p><p>\u201cIt was okay,\u201d TJ shrugged. \u201cLong. Did you know drivers here are real passive aggressive?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus laughed as they started walking back towards his dorm. \u201cMaybe they wouldn\u2019t be so much if you drove like a sane person. How many people did you cut off today?\u201d</p><p>TJ grinned and shoved into him playfully, but his silence confirmed Cyrus\u2019 suspicions. Terrible at directions <i>and</i> a terrible driver. Why did Cyrus find that so endearing?</p><p>\u201cAnd how was the motel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecent. No bed bugs, no murderers, just noisy neighbours.
