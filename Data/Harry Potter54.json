So till tired kicks back in (which god I hope is soon since I have work today), I\u2019m updating what\u2019s happening in my life other than my random reblogs.</p><p>Baby\u2019s room is like 97% ready, just need to get crib/her first bed put together, frames for some Harry Potter artwork and all will be ready for her. Her closet I\u2019m particularly proud of because of the organization- it looks right out of IKEA- also she already has her own laundry hamper. Yea I\u2019ve been nesting hardcore guys. This week I\u2019m packing my hospital bag, with snacks- so I won\u2019t be caught off guard. Hubs and I are particularly antsy about this since we\u2019ve had 6 couples/friends go into labor at this point in the past 3 months. To say he\u2019s watching me like a hawk is an understatement. </p><p>I\u2019m now having my weekly check ups, which my doctor started a week earlier than usual due to my Epilepsy but thankfully things in *that* area have been ok. Yesterday at the appointment she checked me for the first time to see how dilated I am: no one warned about THAT shit! Many noises of pain came out of me but I good not to swear infront of my doctor- I\u2019m holding off till Delivery Day for that. The baby is doing great, most of the scans/checks she\u2019s been camera shy like her Dad but she\u2019s in the right position now. Her heartbeat is LOUD/strong- literally every time we hear it it sounds like a car motor, lol. </p><p>I\u2019ve had one baby shower, which was amazing! My sister, Aunt and a close friend who\u2019ve I\u2019ve known for 15 years threw it for me. It was Harry Potter themed \ud83d\udc97, got several Harry Potter outfits for her, &amp; a HUGE soft blanket my cousin got in Orlando too! Some of my husbands relatives hand made some burp cloths, blankets and they are sooo soft! They always make beautiful things, makes me kinda feel like a bad wife in that regard as I suck as sewing. One thing I\u2019m going to do with all the cards/list of who gave what, is use one of the two scrapbooks so one day Kaylee can see it with all the lovely messages they wrote in there. </p>",

This week I\u2019m packing my hospital bag, with snacks- so I won\u2019t be caught off guard.

To say he\u2019s watching me like a hawk is an understatement. </p><p>I\u2019m now having my weekly check ups, which my doctor started a week earlier than usual due to my Epilepsy but thankfully things in *that* area have been ok. Yesterday at the appointment she checked me for the first time to see how dilated I am: no one warned about THAT shit! Many noises of pain came out of me but I good not to swear infront of my doctor- I\u2019m holding off till Delivery Day for that. The baby is doing great, most of the scans/checks she\u2019s been camera shy like her Dad but she\u2019s in the right position now. Her heartbeat is LOUD/strong- literally every time we hear it it sounds like a car motor, lol. </p><p>I\u2019ve had one baby shower, which was amazing! My sister, Aunt and a close friend who\u2019ve I\u2019ve known for 15 years threw it for me. It was Harry Potter themed \ud83d\udc97, got several Harry Potter outfits for her, &amp; a HUGE soft blanket my cousin got in Orlando too! Some of my husbands relatives hand made some burp cloths, blankets and they are sooo soft! They always make beautiful things, makes me kinda feel like a bad wife in that regard as I suck as sewing. One thing I\u2019m going to do with all the cards/list of who gave what, is use one of the two scrapbooks so one day Kaylee can see it with all the lovely messages they wrote in there. </p></p>",

And even if, as I&rsquo;ve speculated,\nGrindelwald surrendered during the legendary duel and came to some realizations\nof his own, their timing was off.</p><p>He loved\nAberforth, Ariana and Kendra (a familial kind of love) but Aberforth distanced\nhimself after Ariana&rsquo;s death and the already existing cracks in their relationship\nwere enhanced while the two women of his life died early and he was left alone\nand broken.</p><p>He loved\nMinerva and Hagrid and he did see them as friendsi n his way, but while both of\nthem knew aspects of who he was (Minerva more so than Hagrid), neither had\nexperienced Dumbledore&rsquo;s darkest parts. The ones that he was ashamed of and\nthat defined his actions throughout his life.</p><p>And then\nthere was Dumbledore&rsquo;s love for Harry. The love that snuck up on him; the one\nthat he had not intended to feel. The kind of love that a father feels for his\nson, which he tried to deny&hellip;</p><blockquote><p><i>DUMBLEDORE: Harry, don&rsquo;t you think I wanted to\nfight him on your behalf? I would have spared you if</i></p><p><i>I could &mdash;</i></p><p><i>HARRY: &ldquo;Love blinds us&rdquo;? Do you even know what that means? Do\nyou even know how bad that advice</i></p><p><i>was? My son is &mdash; my son is fighting\nbattles for us just as I had to for you. <b>And I have proved as&nbsp;</b></i><i><b>bad a father to him as you were to me.</b>\nLeaving him in places he felt unloved &mdash; growing in him&nbsp;</i><i>resentments he&rsquo;ll take years to\nunderstand &mdash;</i></p><p><i>DUMBLEDORE: If you&rsquo;re referring to Privet Drive, then &mdash;</i></p><p><i>HARRY: Years &mdash; years I spent there alone, without knowing\nwhat I was, or why I was there, without&nbsp;</i><i>knowing\nthat anybody cared!</i></p><p><i>DUMBLEDORE: I &mdash; did not wish to become attached to\nyou &mdash;</i></p><p><i>HARRY: Protecting yourself, even then!</i></p><p><i>DUMBLEDORE: No. I was protecting you. I did not\nwant to hurt you &hellip;</i></p><p><b><i>DUMBLEDORE\n</i><i>attempts\nto reach out of the portrait &mdash; but he can&rsquo;t. He begins to cry but tries to&nbsp;</i><i>hide it.&nbsp;</i></b><i>But I had to meet you in the end &hellip;\neleven years old, and you were so brave. So good. You&nbsp;</i><i>walked uncomplainingly along the path\nthat had been laid at your feet. <b>Of course I loved you &hellip;&nbsp;</b></i><b><i>and I knew that it would happen all\nover again &hellip; that where I loved, I would cause irreparable&nbsp;</i><i>damage.\nI am no fit person to love &hellip; I have never loved without causing harm.</i></b></p></blockquote><p>Dumbledore\ndid everything he could to ensure Harry&rsquo;s survival but he also tried to timid\nhis love because to his experience love tended to cloud his judgment and he\nended up hurting and destroying the people he love. He tried to keep his\ndistance and to be a mentor more than a parental figure; a failed fit because\nof Harry being starved for love, for being treated with respect by the adults\nwho were responsible for him and of his appreciation of Dumbledore as a man\nworthy to look up to.</p><p>However,\nDumbledore was wrong. This distance, this net of protection that he tried to\nkeep in place was exactly what ended up hurting Harry and affecting him even as\nan adult:</p><blockquote><p><i>HARRY: <b>You would have hurt me less if you had told me this\nthen</b>.</i></p><p><i>DUMBLEDORE (openly\nweeping now): I\nwas blind. That is what love does. <b>I couldn&rsquo;t see that you needed&nbsp;</b></i><i><b>to hear that this closed-up, tricky,\ndangerous old man &hellip; loved you.</b></i></p><p><i>A pause.\nThe two men are overcome with emotion.</i></p><p><i>HARRY: It isn&rsquo;t true that I never complained.</i></p><p><i>DUMBLEDORE: Harry, there is never a perfect answer\nin this messy, emotional world. Perfection is&nbsp;</i><i>beyond the reach of humankind, beyond\nthe reach of magic. In every shining moment of&nbsp;</i><i>happiness is that drop of poison: the\nknowledge that pain will come again. <b>Be honest to those you&nbsp;</b></i><i><b>love, show your pain. To suffer is as\nhuman as to breathe.</b></i></p><p><i>HARRY: You said that to me once before.</i></p><p><i>DUMBLEDORE: It is all I have to offer you tonight.</i></p><p><i>He begins\nto walk away.</i></p><p><i>HARRY: Don&rsquo;t go!</i></p><p><i>DUMBLEDORE: Those that we love never truly leave\nus, Harry. <b>There are things that death cannot touch.&nbsp;</b></i><i><b>Paint\n&hellip; and memory &hellip; and love.</b></i></p></blockquote><p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>Dumbledore&rsquo;s\nlast lesson is the thing that he did not manage to deal with </b>his entire life:\nThat pain, imperfection and one&rsquo;s mistakes were something to be dealt with\nrather than to be hidden from the world. Things that could be understood and\novercome through the forgiveness that comes with love.</p><p>And\nironically, this last lesson was taught to him by Harry himself; by Harry who\nsaw his darkness, who saw the way that Dumbledore &nbsp;hurt him in and despite his bitterness and\nhis trauma did not stop loving and trusting him. Harry who questioned him but\nnever lost faith in him. Harry who carried him with him even when he was gone\nfrom the world.</p><blockquote><p><i>HARRY: <b>I loved you too, Dumbledore.</b></i></p><p><i>DUMBLEDORE: <b>I\nknow.</b></i></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;This line has been criticized by many\nas Dumbledore being smug. This is not the case though. Dumbledore has already\nexpressed his love for Harry in this scene. What we have here is Dumbledore\ngetting closure, or rather the reader/audience getting closure in terms of\nDumbledore&rsquo;s story. Through the last fragment that represents Dumbledore in the\nliving world we get the sense that, finally, Dumbledore knows that he is loved;\nflaws and all. Not just that he knows; but that he has been told so&hellip; that he\nlives on through Harry&rsquo;s unconditional love.</p><p>&nbsp;The immortality that this love\nprovides him with is not by any means the character&rsquo;s absolution, but it is\ndefinitely his catharsis.</p>",
