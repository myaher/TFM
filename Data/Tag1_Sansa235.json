His way will always have to be the hidden dagger. He also believes that he learned, via Catelyn, that women will always choose the\u00a0\u201cwrong\u201d option if given the choice. He has such a deep rooted sexism which shows in how he\u2019s treated Sansa and how he manipulated the entire situation with Jon Arryn to lure Ned to KL that he could eventually betray him.</p><p>I\u2019m also fairly sure he is the one that spread the rumor that Lyanna had been kidnapped and raped to lure Brandon to KL knowing he was so aggressive that he would get himself into Stark Trouble \u2122 and end up dead because of it. Brandon, no doubt, wanted to duel Rhaegar like he dueled LF. The fact that LF wrote a letter to Cat immediately after Brandon died (which she burned without reading) is, I think, something we\u2019ll eventually get more information about.

This makes Ned the next target of LF. I\u2019m halfway convinced that he told Hoster Tully himself that Lysa was pregnant because he didn\u2019t want to marry her and was well aware that Hoster was going to force Lysa to terminate the pregnancy. I think him delivering this information to Hoster is why Hoster mysteriously spared his life rather than having him killed.</p><p>So, this is who I think LF is. He thought he slept with Catelyn but it was really Lysa. He revealed Lysa\u2019s pregnancy and ruined her life. He left and made it to KL. He used deceitful financial practices to elevate his position in KL and (I believe) preyed on Brandon\u2019s aggression and sense of honor and lured Brandon to KL (using Lyanna as the bait) to die. Then does the same (using Jon Arryn as the bait) to lure Ned to KL to die.\u00a0</p><p>Then he sets up an elaborate scheme to have Joffrey killed to essentially kidnap Sansa - the new conduit for Catelyn.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019s ALWAYS the hidden dagger. He\u2019s always trying to isolate the victims of his schemes. Which is all leading to my main point about LF\u2019s death.</p><p>When all the lies are stripped away, he\u2019s still just a pathetic, weak, jealous little scumbag. He doesn\u2019t have any true support. He doesn\u2019t inspire loyalty. He can only hope that the truth about him can be buried and blamed on somebody else. But we\u2019ve seen repeatedly that when confronted directly, he is weak.</p><p>On the show, he\u2019s spared by Brandon but left a mess, he\u2019s gripped up by Ned, directly threatened by Cersei, and choked by Jon. Every single time he\u2019s made to look pathetic and weak. All he has are his schemes. So when those schemes fell apart because of Sansa\u2019s awareness - yes, he is the blubbering, pathetic little scumbag he always was. And the portrayal of the stages of his death are actually pretty fascinating in s7xe7.</p><p>First he\u2019s in disbelief, then he tries to bargain, then he becomes angry and yells that no one saw what happened, then he tries to command Royce to take him home (again seeing how he has zero actual power), then he falls to his knees and begs. It\u2019s like the stages of grief in about 15 seconds. Then his last play was to again try to prey on Sansa\u2019s innate desire to be LOVED.\u00a0</p><p>He is such an asshole.

The fact that LF wrote a letter to Cat immediately after Brandon died (which she burned without reading) is, I think, something we\u2019ll eventually get more information about.

I\u2019m halfway convinced that he told Hoster Tully himself that Lysa was pregnant because he didn\u2019t want to marry her and was well aware that Hoster was going to force Lysa to terminate the pregnancy. I think him delivering this information to Hoster is why Hoster mysteriously spared his life rather than having him killed.</p><p>So, this is who I think LF is. He thought he slept with Catelyn but it was really Lysa. He revealed Lysa\u2019s pregnancy and ruined her life. He left and made it to KL. He used deceitful financial practices to elevate his position in KL and (I believe) preyed on Brandon\u2019s aggression and sense of honor and lured Brandon to KL (using Lyanna as the bait) to die. Then does the same (using Jon Arryn as the bait) to lure Ned to KL to die.\u00a0</p><p>Then he sets up an elaborate scheme to have Joffrey killed to essentially kidnap Sansa - the new conduit for Catelyn.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019s ALWAYS the hidden dagger.

He doesn\u2019t have any true support. He doesn\u2019t inspire loyalty. He can only hope that the truth about him can be buried and blamed on somebody else. But we\u2019ve seen repeatedly that when confronted directly, he is weak.</p><p>On the show, he\u2019s spared by Brandon but left a mess, he\u2019s gripped up by Ned, directly threatened by Cersei, and choked by Jon. Every single time he\u2019s made to look pathetic and weak. All he has are his schemes. So when those schemes fell apart because of Sansa\u2019s awareness - yes, he is the blubbering, pathetic little scumbag he always was. And the portrayal of the stages of his death are actually pretty fascinating in s7xe7.</p><p>First he\u2019s in disbelief, then he tries to bargain, then he becomes angry and yells that no one saw what happened, then he tries to command Royce to take him home (again seeing how he has zero actual power), then he falls to his knees and begs. It\u2019s like the stages of grief in about 15 seconds. Then his last play was to again try to prey on Sansa\u2019s innate desire to be LOVED.\u00a0</p><p>He is such an asshole. He just spent about 3 seasons trying to cultivate Sansa\u2019s belief that she\u2019ll never be loved exactly for moments like this. His whole scheme is predicated on Sansa believing that she, for some reason, needs LF..but she doesn\u2019t.</p><p>And it\u2019s so damn satisfying when this asshole, the guy who (I think) got Brandon and Rickard Stark killed, got Ned killed, got Jon Arryn killed, got Sansa framed for murder, got Tyrion framed for murder (Tyrion later does become a murderer), essentially started the War of the Five Kings that ravaged Westeros, and tried to psychologically turn Sansa into nothing but a slave as a fulfillment of his deranged fantasies about her mother, died on his knees blubbering like the true cowardly evil piece of shit that he is.</p><p>It was\u2026in a word\u2026perfect.</p></p>",
