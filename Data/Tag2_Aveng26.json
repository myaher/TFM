It\u2019s revealed right before the airport fight that he only had twelve hours left.</p><p>That means that he recruited Peter Parker at some point during that twenty-four hour window.</p><p>In Homecoming\u2019s opening scene, \u201cA Film By Peter Parker\u201d, we see that Tony Stark has made him a new suit. A wickedly awesome new suit with hundreds of web combinations, an instant kill mode, and his own AI.</p><p>That\u2019s not stuff he can make in a twenty-four hour period. Even Tony Stark can\u2019t do that; it\u2019s simply not possible.</p><p>Of course Tony already knew who Spider-Man was, hence why he was able to recruit him, but he was also working on making him a new suit, even before Civil War.</p><p>He saw a kid in \u201cdire need of an upgrade\u201d, and started making him a suit.

now standing around arguing about how they would best defeat Thanos.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p>None of them could agree on anything. \u00a0\u201cThat won\u2019t work,\u201d Nebula said with an exasperated sigh. \u00a0She was getting tired of all the fighting, and just wanted to get this over with.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean that won\u2019t work?\u201d \u00a0Scott asked. \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s how they do it in all those time machine movies.\u201d \u00a0He began to rattle off a bunch of movies with Rhodey jumping in and naming a few himself.</p><p>\u201cGuys,\u201d Bruce said, you still hadn\u2019t gotten used to the fact that he was half Hulk and half Bruce. \u00a0But you were happy that he seemed to have found a happy medium where he wasn\u2019t turning into a giant green rage monster as Tony would have called him.</p><p>\u201cNone of those movies are correct,\u201d Tony cut in. \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s not how time travel works. \u00a0Going back in time and changing something will just cause an alternate branch in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you absolutely sure?\u201d \u00a0Scott asked.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d \u00a0Nebula, Tony, and Hulk shouted together. \u00a0Scott held up his hands and moved back a few paces.</p><p>Steve ran a hand through his hair, \u201cThen we need to figure out another way to stop him, some way that we can bring everyone back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell there\u2019s not much that we can do on that front now is there Cap,\u201d Tony argued.</p><p>They continued to bicker back and forth while you sat back and glared at them. \u00a0This was ridiculous, they were a team for God\u2019s sake. \u00a0They should be able to do this together. \u00a0To solve this problem together.</p><p>You knew they were all under a lot of stress, it had been five years since the snap and now that there could be a chance that everyone could be brought back you knew that tensions were running on high. \u00a0You wished that this wasn\u2019t happening and that you all hadn\u2019t lost the first time.</p><p>You all were the Avengers for crying out loud. \u00a0Earth\u2019s mightiest heroes. \u00a0But right now you didn\u2019t think you could even call yourselves that with the way you all were fighting with one another.</p><p>You got up out of your seat, none of the others noticing you walking out of the room and down the hall. \u00a0You were going to get them to stop fighting with one another.</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y. unlock the lab,\u201d you instructed.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d the AI responded.</p><p>When you made it to Tony\u2019s lab the doors opened for you and you stepped inside looking around at the surfaces littered with half-finished projects and parts from his inventions. \u00a0You were after one specific project that you and Tony had been working on before he had left the compound to spend time with Pepper.</p><p>You moved around the tables searching for what you were looking for.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been a serious project at first. \u00a0You all had nerded out one night and decided that it would be fun to try and actually build one for yourselves. \u00a0Then Thanos had come and the project had been put on hold. \u00a0And now with the thought of going to face Thanos again, you had decided to finish the project just in case.</p><p>You picked it up and hit the switch, the blade of the lighTony had argued over what color the blade would be. \u00a0He had wanted red like his suit but you argued that only the bad guys had used the red sabers. \u00a0You said you wanted it to be purple because the man playing Mace Windu was a spitting image of Nick Fury. \u00a0The two of you had decided then and there that Nick had had a career in film before he lost his eye and joined SHIELD.</p><p>You switched it off and headed down the hall where the others were still arguing with one another. \u00a0You rolled your eyes and whistled gaining their attention. \u00a0You turned the lightsaber on, Tony\u2019s mouth dropping open, he had no idea that you had finished it. \u00a0\u201cI was gonna use this on Thanos, but I&rsquo;m this close to using it on you guys,&ldquo; you turned it off again now that you had their attention. \u00a0\u201cWe do not need to be fighting right now. \u00a0We are a team and we will figure this out together. \u00a0Now get your asses in gear and let\u2019s figure out a plan!\u201d</p><p>You turned around and left the room to go put the lightsaber back in its spot, Tony leaned over to Steve and went, \u201cI\u2019m a little terrified right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me both, I\u2019ve never seen them like that before.\u201d</p><p>When you came back in they were calmly discussing game plans with one another which made you feel relieved, the fighting was starting to give you a headache.</p><p><br/></p><p>The plan was simple. \u00a0Sneak up behind Thanos and try to get a shot in.</p><p>Well, that plan just became infinitely harder with the size of his army. \u00a0\u201cUh guys, I think we need a new plan,\u201d you said into your earpiece.</p><p>The others had returned and were fighting alongside all of you. \u00a0You were happy to see your friends again, five years had been too long without them. \u00a0\u201cWe need a distraction,\u201d Steve said.</p><p>\u201cHey guys, have you seen that movie <i>The Matrix</i>?\u201d Peter said as he came to a stop in front of you.</p><p>\u201cGod I\u2019ve missed that kid,\u201d Tony said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about it Peter?\u201d \u00a0You ask him as you dodge several attacks from Thanos\u2019s army.</p><p>\u201cYou know how they travel through the phones and it acts as like a portal?\u201d \u00a0When you tell him you know he continues. \u00a0\u201cWhat if someone distracts Thanos while Mr. Strange opens a portal and you leap through it and pull off some Jedi badassery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could work,\u201d Strange appeared beside you. \u00a0\u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, I need a distraction,\u201d you informed him. \u00a0\u201cA big one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay no more, Y/L/N. \u00a0I\u2019ve got you covered.\u201d \u00a0Tony went zipping over your head and he started to pull off trying to keep Thanos from realizing what was about to happen. \u00a0Steve and Thor joined him, the three of him keeping Thanos\u2019s back to you.</p><p>Strange opened a portal and you raced through it, turning the lightsaber on as you did so, the blade humming to life. \u00a0Thanos heard and turned just in time to see you bring the purple blade down and successfully cut off his head. \u00a0His body dropped to the ground and Thor quickly gathered up the gauntlet each of them staring at you with equal parts awe and nervousness.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where that came from, but I have never seen you so aggressive before,\u201d Steve said as he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat? \u00a0I went for his head like I was supposed to,\u201d you responded.</p><p>\u201cRemind me to never piss you off,\u201d Tony replied before heading back into the air. \u00a0\u201cWe still have work to do people, Thor get that gauntlet and those stones back to where they belong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on it, Stark,\u201d he replied before he had Steve rushed off to try and get the stones to safety.</p><p>You looked down at the blade and grinned, \u201cGuys, can my superhero name be Jedi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d was the resounding response through the comms.</p><p>You shrugged it off and headed back into the fight, using the lightsaber to your advantage as you fought off the rest of Thanos\u2019s army which had now fallen into chaos without its leader.</p><p>When the army had been defeated or retreated to space once more there seemed to be a collective sigh of relief even though you knew there was still work to be done. \u00a0The compound lied in ruins and there was the small fact that some of Thanos\u2019s men had escaped.</p><p>But you decided that that was a problem for another day. \u00a0Right now you needed to tend to the wounded and regroup before you went on any expeditions to track down the others.</p><p>Reunions went around that night as everyone welcomed back those that had been lost, and for once the world didn\u2019t seem so grey and bleak anymore. \u00a0You knew there would be celebrations all over the world as people realized that their loved ones were back, and you were happy knowing that you all had managed to save them all.</p><p>As a team.</p>",

you instructed.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; the AI responded.</p><p>When you made it to Tony&rsquo;s lab the doors opened for you and you stepped inside looking around at the surfaces littered with half-finished projects and parts from his inventions. &nbsp;You were after one specific project that you and Tony had been working on before he had left the compound to spend time with Pepper.</p><p>You moved around the tables searching for what you were looking for.</p><p>It hadn&rsquo;t been a serious project at first. &nbsp;You all had nerded out one night and decided that it would be fun to try and actually build one for yourselves. &nbsp;Then Thanos had come and the project had been put on hold. &nbsp;And now with the thought of going to face Thanos again, you had decided to finish the project just in case.</p><p>You picked it up and hit the switch, the blade of the lighTony had argued over what color the blade would be. &nbsp;He had wanted red like his suit but you argued that only the bad guys had used the red sabers. &nbsp;You said you wanted it to be purple because the man playing Mace Windu was a spitting image of Nick Fury. &nbsp;The two of you had decided then and there that Nick had had a career in film before he lost his eye and joined SHIELD.</p><p>You switched it off and headed down the hall where the others were still arguing with one another. &nbsp;You rolled your eyes and whistled gaining their attention. &nbsp;You turned the lightsaber on, Tony&rsquo;s mouth dropping open, he had no idea that you had finished it. &nbsp;&ldquo;I was gonna use this on Thanos, but I&rsquo;m this close to using it on you guys,&ldquo; you turned it off again now that you had their attention. &nbsp;&ldquo;We do not need to be fighting right now. &nbsp;We are a team and we will figure this out together. &nbsp;Now get your asses in gear and let&rsquo;s figure out a plan!&rdquo;</p><p>You turned around and left the room to go put the lightsaber back in its spot, Tony leaned over to Steve and went, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a little terrified right now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You and me both, I&rsquo;ve never seen them like that before.&rdquo;</p><p>When you came back in they were calmly discussing game plans with one another which made you feel relieved, the fighting was starting to give you a headache.</p><p><br /></p><p>The plan was simple. &nbsp;Sneak up behind Thanos and try to get a shot in.</p><p>Well, that plan just became infinitely harder with the size of his army. &nbsp;&ldquo;Uh guys, I think we need a new plan,&rdquo; you said into your earpiece.</p><p>The others had returned and were fighting alongside all of you. &nbsp;You were happy to see your friends again, five years had been too long without them. &nbsp;&ldquo;We need a distraction,&rdquo; Steve said.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey guys, have you seen that movie <i>The Matrix</i>?&rdquo; Peter said as he came to a stop in front of you.</p><p>&ldquo;God I&rsquo;ve missed that kid,&rdquo; Tony said.</p><p>&ldquo;What about it Peter?&rdquo; &nbsp;You ask him as you dodge several attacks from Thanos&rsquo;s army.</p><p>&ldquo;You know how they travel through the phones and it acts as like a portal?&rdquo; &nbsp;When you tell him you know he continues. &nbsp;&ldquo;What if someone distracts Thanos while Mr. Strange opens a portal and you leap through it and pull off some Jedi badassery?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It could work,&rdquo; Strange appeared beside you. &nbsp;&ldquo;Shall we?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony, I need a distraction,&rdquo; you informed him. &nbsp;&ldquo;A big one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Say no more, Y/L/N. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve got you covered.&rdquo; &nbsp;Tony went zipping over your head and he started to pull off trying to keep Thanos from realizing what was about to happen. &nbsp;Steve and Thor joined him, the three of him keeping Thanos&rsquo;s back to you.</p><p>Strange opened a portal and you raced through it, turning the lightsaber on as you did so, the blade humming to life. &nbsp;Thanos heard and turned just in time to see you bring the purple blade down and successfully cut off his head. &nbsp;His body dropped to the ground and Thor quickly gathered up the gauntlet each of them staring at you with equal parts awe and nervousness.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where that came from, but I have never seen you so aggressive before,&rdquo; Steve said as he shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;What? &nbsp;I went for his head like I was supposed to,&rdquo; you responded.</p><p>&ldquo;Remind me to never piss you off,&rdquo; Tony replied before heading back into the air. &nbsp;&ldquo;We still have work to do people, Thor get that gauntlet and those stones back to where they belong.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on it, Stark,&rdquo; he replied before he had Steve rushed off to try and get the stones to safety.</p><p>You looked down at the blade and grinned, &ldquo;Guys, can my superhero name be Jedi?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the resounding response through the comms.</p><p>You shrugged it off and headed back into the fight, using the lightsaber to your advantage as you fought off the rest of Thanos&rsquo;s army which had now fallen into chaos without its leader.</p><p>When the army had been defeated or retreated to space once more there seemed to be a collective sigh of relief even though you knew there was still work to be done. &nbsp;The compound lied in ruins and there was the small fact that some of Thanos&rsquo;s men had escaped.</p><p>But you decided that that was a problem for another day. &nbsp;Right now you needed to tend to the wounded and regroup before you went on any expeditions to track down the others.</p><p>Reunions went around that night as everyone welcomed back those that had been lost, and for once the world didn&rsquo;t seem so grey and bleak anymore. &nbsp;You knew there would be celebrations all over the world as people realized that their loved ones were back, and you were happy knowing that you all had managed to save them all.</p><p>As a team.</p>",
