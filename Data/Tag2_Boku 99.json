But, instead of their normal names, I named them Red, Izuzu, and King Explosion Murder or KEM for short. Then, I invited Bakugou to come over to my place and I introduced him to my puppies. I even showed him how KEM looked like the puppy version of him. As I was showing off KEM in my arms, Bakugou and KEM had a glaring contest. KEM was barking like crazy as if he was trying to curse at Bakugou and Bakugou was also yelling back at KEM (yes Bakugou got in a fight with a dog). It was so intense that even Izuzu was trembling in fear behind my leg. Knowing Red, he tried to climb up Bakugou&rsquo;s pant leg to try to calm Bakugou down. Despite Red&rsquo;s failed efforts, his wagging tail was just too cute that I put down KEM to pick up Red. KEM turned around to face me and made a sad/jealous pout. Bakugou caught eye of that and silently snickered.

        "body": "<p><b>Previously on BnHA:</b>\u00a0Recovery Girl healed up Endeavor and he left the hospital with a shiny new scar. Hawks apologized for everything that happened and came up with some\nbullshit story about how they were probably spotted by villains earlier and made a tempting target and that\u2019s why they were\nattacked. We also learned that he was more or less raised to become a hero from a young age and didn\u2019t have much of a choice in the matter due to\nhis talent. Endeavor headed on home where his kids were waiting to greet\nhim. Although they were glad he was all right, Natsuo couldn\u2019t\nhold back his anger toward Endeavor for tormenting Shouto and Rei for all those years, and for\ntaking this long to finally get an attitude adjustment. Shouto acknowledged that Endeavor the hero was amazing, but he felt\nsimilarly to Natsuo as far as forgiving Endeavor the father. However, he said he was willing to wait and see, and that he knew better than anyone how \u201cone\nsmall inspiration\u201d could change a person. Endeavor thought about the\nepiphany he\u2019d recently had that his children were the most important thing\nand that as a hero it was his duty to protect them. He also realized it was too\nlate to apologize for all of his wrongdoings, and that the only thing he can do\nnow is to move forward. That evening, Deku fell asleep after a long\nday of training, and dreamed of the past wielders of One for All, including the\nvery first, All for One\u2019s younger brother.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> Deku finds himself in the midst of a wildly trippy dream sequence. First he sees the eight other wielders of OFA, and then his attention is drawn towards a flashback conversation between AFO and OFA the First. The First accuses AFO of using his quirk to fulfill his own selfish desires. AFO maintains he is using it for the good of the people. He demonstrates this by taking a mutation quirk from a man who wants to be rid of it, and bestowing a quirk upon a quirkless man who wanted a power of his own for self defense. The two men appear grateful, but the First says that AFO is really just creating an army of loyal servants to do his bidding. AFO says he intends to restore order to the world, and goes on to imprison his brother while he creates his army. Some time later he visits his younger brother and brags about how his dreams are becoming a reality,\u00a0\u201cjust like in that comic we read together way back when.\u201d The First says that AFO never finished the comic, and at the end of the story the Demon King lost to the Hero of Justice. AFO is all\u00a0\u201cwell whatever IT\u2019S NOT LIKE THIS IS A MANGA OR SOMETHING,\u201d and then forces a quirk on OFA in order to entice him to join him. The scene fades, and Deku finds himself speaking with the First directly. He mentions something about them having passed\u00a0\u201cthe point of singularity\u201d, and tells Deku that he is not alone. Deku wakes up and finds that he\u2019s somehow activated his quirk in his sleep and destroyed his room. He stares at his hand in shock and the chapter ends.</p><p><br/></p><p>(As always, all comments not marked with an ETA are my <i>mostly </i>unspoiled reactions from my first readthrough of this chapter. I\u2019ve read up through chapter 213 now, so any ETAs will reflect that. <b>If you haven\u2019t read that chapter, <i>don\u2019t read this recap!</i></b> Don\u2019t be like me and think\u00a0\u201ceh I\u2019m probably good, I bet I know most of the big stuff by now\u201d and get cocky and then live to regret it sob.)</p><!-- more --><p><br/></p><ul><li>so just a quick thing here &ndash; I have unfortunately been\nspoiled for something big related to Deku, which is that he is going to be\ngetting additional quirks. six, to be precise. and that\u2019s all the details I saw\nbefore I clicked away (much too late), but unfortunately it was enough to put\neverything else together. because he is the ninth owner of OFA, and the\nsecond quirkless wielder, and the original dude\u2019s quirk <i>was</i> OFA. but the other six \n\nwielders presumably had their own quirks,\nand so in hindsight it makes perfect sense that he would inherit not just their strength, but all of\ntheir abilities. and since it had been hinted at that there would be more OFA\nstuff coming up around this point in the manga, and also that Deku would be\ngetting some sort of huge power-up,\nit wasn\u2019t hard to put two and two together here. so yeah, I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s\nwhat all of this is eventually building up to</li><li>but oddly enough, that\u2019s not even in my top 5 list of things\nthat I\u2019m actually excited for here! I don\u2019t even care about him getting their\nabilities tbh, but I\u2019m just curious whether he\u2019ll be able to talk to them and\nhave access to their memories! and for the first time it appears that yes, he\nwill! which makes me <i>so fucking excited</i>\nyou guys, because I have at least two of three fanfic ideas that have been\npermeating in my head for quite a while now which are very reliant on this\nconcept. so I\u2019m so fucking glad this panned out omfg</li><li>AND I WANT HIM TO MEET NANA OH MY GOD</li><li>ANYWAY!!

I don\u2019t even care about him getting their\nabilities tbh, but I\u2019m just curious whether he\u2019ll be able to talk to them and\nhave access to their memories! and for the first time it appears that yes, he\nwill! which makes me <i>so fucking excited</i>\nyou guys, because I have at least two of three fanfic ideas that have been\npermeating in my head for quite a while now which are very reliant on this\nconcept. so I\u2019m so fucking glad this panned out omfg</li><li>AND I WANT HIM TO MEET NANA OH MY GOD</li><li>ANYWAY!!

Hawks apologized for everything that happened and came up with some\nbullshit story about how they were probably spotted by villains earlier and made a tempting target and that\u2019s why they were\nattacked. We also learned that he was more or less raised to become a hero from a young age and didn\u2019t have much of a choice in the matter due to\nhis talent. Endeavor headed on home where his kids were waiting to greet\nhim. Although they were glad he was all right, Natsuo couldn\u2019t\nhold back his anger toward Endeavor for tormenting Shouto and Rei for all those years, and for\ntaking this long to finally get an attitude adjustment. Shouto acknowledged that Endeavor the hero was amazing, but he felt\nsimilarly to Natsuo as far as forgiving Endeavor the father. However, he said he was willing to wait and see, and that he knew better than anyone how \u201cone\nsmall inspiration\u201d could change a person. Endeavor thought about the\nepiphany he\u2019d recently had that his children were the most important thing\nand that as a hero it was his duty to protect them. He also realized it was too\nlate to apologize for all of his wrongdoings, and that the only thing he can do\nnow is to move forward. That evening, Deku fell asleep after a long\nday of training, and dreamed of the past wielders of One for All, including the\nvery first, All for One\u2019s younger brother.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> Deku finds himself in the midst of a wildly trippy dream sequence. First he sees the eight other wielders of OFA, and then his attention is drawn towards a flashback conversation between AFO and OFA the First. The First accuses AFO of using his quirk to fulfill his own selfish desires. AFO maintains he is using it for the good of the people. He demonstrates this by taking a mutation quirk from a man who wants to be rid of it, and bestowing a quirk upon a quirkless man who wanted a power of his own for self defense. The two men appear grateful, but the First says that AFO is really just creating an army of loyal servants to do his bidding. AFO says he intends to restore order to the world, and goes on to imprison his brother while he creates his army. Some time later he visits his younger brother and brags about how his dreams are becoming a reality,\u00a0\u201cjust like in that comic we read together way back when.\u201d The First says that AFO never finished the comic, and at the end of the story the Demon King lost to the Hero of Justice. AFO is all\u00a0\u201cwell whatever IT\u2019S NOT LIKE THIS IS A MANGA OR SOMETHING,\u201d and then forces a quirk on OFA in order to entice him to join him. The scene fades, and Deku finds himself speaking with the First directly. He mentions something about them having passed\u00a0\u201cthe point of singularity\u201d, and tells Deku that he is not alone. Deku wakes up and finds that he\u2019s somehow activated his quirk in his sleep and destroyed his room. He stares at his hand in shock and the chapter ends.</p><p><br></p><p>(As always, all comments not marked with an ETA are my <i>mostly </i>unspoiled reactions from my first readthrough of this chapter. I\u2019ve read up through chapter 213 now, so any ETAs will reflect that. <b>If you haven\u2019t read that chapter, <i>don\u2019t read this recap!</i></b> Don\u2019t be like me and think\u00a0\u201ceh I\u2019m probably good, I bet I know most of the big stuff by now\u201d and get cocky and then live to regret it sob.)</p>[[MORE]]<p><br></p><ul><li>so just a quick thing here \u2013 I have unfortunately been\nspoiled for something big related to Deku, which is that he is going to be\ngetting additional quirks. six, to be precise. and that\u2019s all the details I saw\nbefore I clicked away (much too late), but unfortunately it was enough to put\neverything else together. because he is the ninth owner of OFA, and the\nsecond quirkless wielder, and the original dude\u2019s quirk <i>was</i> OFA. but the other six \n\nwielders presumably had their own quirks,\nand so in hindsight it makes perfect sense that he would inherit not just their strength, but all of\ntheir abilities. and since it had been hinted at that there would be more OFA\nstuff coming up around this point in the manga, and also that Deku would be\ngetting some sort of huge power-up,\nit wasn\u2019t hard to put two and two together here. so yeah, I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s\nwhat all of this is eventually building up to</li><li>but oddly enough, that\u2019s not even in my top 5 list of things\nthat I\u2019m actually excited for here!

                "content": "<p><b>Previously on BnHA:</b>&nbsp;Recovery Girl healed up Endeavor and he left the hospital with a shiny new scar. Hawks apologized for everything that happened and came up with some\nbullshit story about how they were probably spotted by villains earlier and made a tempting target and that&rsquo;s why they were\nattacked. We also learned that he was more or less raised to become a hero from a young age and didn&rsquo;t have much of a choice in the matter due to\nhis talent. Endeavor headed on home where his kids were waiting to greet\nhim. Although they were glad he was all right, Natsuo couldn&rsquo;t\nhold back his anger toward Endeavor for tormenting Shouto and Rei for all those years, and for\ntaking this long to finally get an attitude adjustment. Shouto acknowledged that Endeavor the hero was amazing, but he felt\nsimilarly to Natsuo as far as forgiving Endeavor the father. However, he said he was willing to wait and see, and that he knew better than anyone how &ldquo;one\nsmall inspiration&rdquo; could change a person. Endeavor thought about the\nepiphany he&rsquo;d recently had that his children were the most important thing\nand that as a hero it was his duty to protect them. He also realized it was too\nlate to apologize for all of his wrongdoings, and that the only thing he can do\nnow is to move forward. That evening, Deku fell asleep after a long\nday of training, and dreamed of the past wielders of One for All, including the\nvery first, All for One&rsquo;s younger brother.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> Deku finds himself in the midst of a wildly trippy dream sequence. First he sees the eight other wielders of OFA, and then his attention is drawn towards a flashback conversation between AFO and OFA the First. The First accuses AFO of using his quirk to fulfill his own selfish desires. AFO maintains he is using it for the good of the people. He demonstrates this by taking a mutation quirk from a man who wants to be rid of it, and bestowing a quirk upon a quirkless man who wanted a power of his own for self defense. The two men appear grateful, but the First says that AFO is really just creating an army of loyal servants to do his bidding. AFO says he intends to restore order to the world, and goes on to imprison his brother while he creates his army. Some time later he visits his younger brother and brags about how his dreams are becoming a reality,&nbsp;&ldquo;just like in that comic we read together way back when.&rdquo; The First says that AFO never finished the comic, and at the end of the story the Demon King lost to the Hero of Justice. AFO is all&nbsp;&ldquo;well whatever IT&rsquo;S NOT LIKE THIS IS A MANGA OR SOMETHING,&rdquo; and then forces a quirk on OFA in order to entice him to join him. The scene fades, and Deku finds himself speaking with the First directly. He mentions something about them having passed&nbsp;&ldquo;the point of singularity&rdquo;, and tells Deku that he is not alone. Deku wakes up and finds that he&rsquo;s somehow activated his quirk in his sleep and destroyed his room. He stares at his hand in shock and the chapter ends.</p><p><br /></p><p>(As always, all comments not marked with an ETA are my <i>mostly </i>unspoiled reactions from my first readthrough of this chapter. I&rsquo;ve read up through chapter 213 now, so any ETAs will reflect that. <b>If you haven&rsquo;t read that chapter, <i>don&rsquo;t read this recap!</i></b> Don&rsquo;t be like me and think&nbsp;&ldquo;eh I&rsquo;m probably good, I bet I know most of the big stuff by now&rdquo; and get cocky and then live to regret it sob.)</p><p><br /></p><ul><li>so just a quick thing here &ndash; I have unfortunately been\nspoiled for something big related to Deku, which is that he is going to be\ngetting additional quirks. six, to be precise. and that&rsquo;s all the details I saw\nbefore I clicked away (much too late), but unfortunately it was enough to put\neverything else together. because he is the ninth owner of OFA, and the\nsecond quirkless wielder, and the original dude&rsquo;s quirk <i>was</i> OFA. but the other six \n\nwielders presumably had their own quirks,\nand so in hindsight it makes perfect sense that he would inherit not just their strength, but all of\ntheir abilities. and since it had been hinted at that there would be more OFA\nstuff coming up around this point in the manga, and also that Deku would be\ngetting some sort of huge power-up,\nit wasn&rsquo;t hard to put two and two together here. so yeah, I&rsquo;m pretty sure that&rsquo;s\nwhat all of this is eventually building up to</li><li>but oddly enough, that&rsquo;s not even in my top 5 list of things\nthat I&rsquo;m actually excited for here! I don&rsquo;t even care about him getting their\nabilities tbh, but I&rsquo;m just curious whether he&rsquo;ll be able to talk to them and\nhave access to their memories! and for the first time it appears that yes, he\nwill! which makes me <i>so fucking excited</i>\nyou guys, because I have at least two of three fanfic ideas that have been\npermeating in my head for quite a while now which are very reliant on this\nconcept. so I&rsquo;m so fucking glad this panned out omfg</li><li>AND I WANT HIM TO MEET NANA OH MY GOD</li><li>ANYWAY!!

                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p><b>Previously on BnHA:</b>&nbsp;Recovery Girl healed up Endeavor and he left the hospital with a shiny new scar. Hawks apologized for everything that happened and came up with some\nbullshit story about how they were probably spotted by villains earlier and made a tempting target and that&rsquo;s why they were\nattacked. We also learned that he was more or less raised to become a hero from a young age and didn&rsquo;t have much of a choice in the matter due to\nhis talent. Endeavor headed on home where his kids were waiting to greet\nhim. Although they were glad he was all right, Natsuo couldn&rsquo;t\nhold back his anger toward Endeavor for tormenting Shouto and Rei for all those years, and for\ntaking this long to finally get an attitude adjustment. Shouto acknowledged that Endeavor the hero was amazing, but he felt\nsimilarly to Natsuo as far as forgiving Endeavor the father. However, he said he was willing to wait and see, and that he knew better than anyone how &ldquo;one\nsmall inspiration&rdquo; could change a person. Endeavor thought about the\nepiphany he&rsquo;d recently had that his children were the most important thing\nand that as a hero it was his duty to protect them. He also realized it was too\nlate to apologize for all of his wrongdoings, and that the only thing he can do\nnow is to move forward. That evening, Deku fell asleep after a long\nday of training, and dreamed of the past wielders of One for All, including the\nvery first, All for One&rsquo;s younger brother.</p>\n<p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> Deku finds himself in the midst of a wildly trippy dream sequence. First he sees the eight other wielders of OFA, and then his attention is drawn towards a flashback conversation between AFO and OFA the First. The First accuses AFO of using his quirk to fulfill his own selfish desires. AFO maintains he is using it for the good of the people. He demonstrates this by taking a mutation quirk from a man who wants to be rid of it, and bestowing a quirk upon a quirkless man who wanted a power of his own for self defense. The two men appear grateful, but the First says that AFO is really just creating an army of loyal servants to do his bidding. AFO says he intends to restore order to the world, and goes on to imprison his brother while he creates his army. Some time later he visits his younger brother and brags about how his dreams are becoming a reality,&nbsp;&ldquo;just like in that comic we read together way back when.&rdquo; The First says that AFO never finished the comic, and at the end of the story the Demon King lost to the Hero of Justice. AFO is all&nbsp;&ldquo;well whatever IT&rsquo;S NOT LIKE THIS IS A MANGA OR SOMETHING,&rdquo; and then forces a quirk on OFA in order to entice him to join him. The scene fades, and Deku finds himself speaking with the First directly. He mentions something about them having passed&nbsp;&ldquo;the point of singularity&rdquo;, and tells Deku that he is not alone. Deku wakes up and finds that he&rsquo;s somehow activated his quirk in his sleep and destroyed his room. He stares at his hand in shock and the chapter ends.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>(As always, all comments not marked with an ETA are my <i>mostly </i>unspoiled reactions from my first readthrough of this chapter. I&rsquo;ve read up through chapter 213 now, so any ETAs will reflect that. <b>If you haven&rsquo;t read that chapter, <i>don&rsquo;t read this recap!</i></b> Don&rsquo;t be like me and think&nbsp;&ldquo;eh I&rsquo;m probably good, I bet I know most of the big stuff by now&rdquo; and get cocky and then live to regret it sob.)</p>\n</p>",
