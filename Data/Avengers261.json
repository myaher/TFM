He groans slightly before shutting them again, then mustering up some strength he opens them again, slowly, getting them accustomed to the light. He should have closed the curtains last night, but Steve hadn\u2019t been able to fall asleep, he had tossed and turned in bed before giving up and watching the night life through his window until it bored him. Finally Steve had settled in to try some sketches, his head bowed over the desk he kept in his room, fingers smudged with the charcoal he had decided to use for his art. How he had fallen asleep he hadn\u2019t known but it certainly wasn\u2019t good for his back, super soldier serum or not a hard desk was no more comfortable than sleeping on the cold ground with a thin covering during the War.</p><p>His groan returns as Steve shuffles off to the bathroom, taking care of business he washes his hands and takes a quick glance in the mirror, his beard is scruffy and he definitely needs a shave. Thinking about the effort it would take without any breakfast or at the very least some coffee makes him wince and Steve decides to make a quick stop in the kitchen before hitting the shower. Yes, some food then a shave. It was still early and he doubted that anyone else would be up.</p><p>The kitchen is quiet and here the sunlight is even brighter thanks in part to the large ceiling to floor window that overlooked New York. Usually Steve would be what Tony called an \u2018early bird\u2019 but today he wished he could have just a few more hours of sleep. Stopping by the window and taking a glance outside Steve spies a helicopter which flies by close enough for him to see the passengers, one of them points a camera his way and he lifts a hand in a tired wave. He knew before he could hit the streets in a few hours they would have broadcasted \u2018Captain America wears pajamas!\u2019 or some other such nonsense that passed for news these days over every newspaper or tabloid magazine. Steve didn\u2019t like that kind of media attention but at this point he feels tired enough to want to crawl back into the ice rather than dealing with them. They fly off and Steve feels a clap on his shoulder which make him forget the helicopter. Turning he sees Tony, who usually would be sleeping in until the late afternoon before waking up grumpy. It seems their roles were reversed today because while Steve\u2019s expression clearly says that a coma would be welcome right about now, Tony was grinning from ear to ear and his voice is chipper enough to hurt Steve\u2019s ears.</p><p>\u201cGood morning sleeping beauty!

Here.\u201d</p><p>Steve is a bit confused but looking down he sees a cup of steaming hot coffee in Tony\u2019s outstretched hand and Steve\u2019s lips curve into a soft smile as the scent invades his senses. His hand wrap around the mug and saying \u2018thanks\u2019 in a low rumble before taking his first sip. The liquid is nearly scalding, and as it pools in his belly he feels a warmth blossoming within him and his smile becomes more like his usual one. Steve had been expecting one of Tony\u2019s experimental drinks, he and Bruce would often end their late night lab session coming up with ways to make coffee stronger, better, than the weak stuff Steve enjoyed.</p><p>He grew up on weak coffee; his mother Sarah would sometimes let Steve have a sip from her cup.

He groans slightly before shutting them again, then mustering up some strength he opens them again, slowly, getting them accustomed to the light. He should have closed the curtains last night, but Steve hadn\u2019t been able to fall asleep, he had tossed and turned in bed before giving up and watching the night life through his window until it bored him. Finally Steve had settled in to try some sketches, his head bowed over the desk he kept in his room, fingers smudged with the charcoal he had decided to use for his art. How he had fallen asleep he hadn\u2019t known but it certainly wasn\u2019t good for his back, super soldier serum or not a hard desk was no more comfortable than sleeping on the cold ground with a thin covering during the War.</p><p>His groan returns as Steve shuffles off to the bathroom, taking care of business he washes his hands and takes a quick glance in the mirror, his beard is scruffy and he definitely needs a shave. Thinking about the effort it would take without any breakfast or at the very least some coffee makes him wince and Steve decides to make a quick stop in the kitchen before hitting the shower. Yes, some food then a shave. It was still early and he doubted that anyone else would be up.</p><p>The kitchen is quiet and here the sunlight is even brighter thanks in part to the large ceiling to floor window that overlooked New York. Usually Steve would be what Tony called an \u2018early bird\u2019 but today he wished he could have just a few more hours of sleep. Stopping by the window and taking a glance outside Steve spies a helicopter which flies by close enough for him to see the passengers, one of them points a camera his way and he lifts a hand in a tired wave. He knew before he could hit the streets in a few hours they would have broadcasted \u2018Captain America wears pajamas!\u2019 or some other such nonsense that passed for news these days over every newspaper or tabloid magazine. Steve didn\u2019t like that kind of media attention but at this point he feels tired enough to want to crawl back into the ice rather than dealing with them. They fly off and Steve feels a clap on his shoulder which make him forget the helicopter. Turning he sees Tony, who usually would be sleeping in until the late afternoon before waking up grumpy. It seems their roles were reversed today because while Steve\u2019s expression clearly says that a coma would be welcome right about now, Tony was grinning from ear to ear and his voice is chipper enough to hurt Steve\u2019s ears.</p><p>\u201cGood morning sleeping beauty! Sleep well Winghead?\u201d</p><p>He gives Tony a scowl; he really wasn\u2019t in the best of moods this morning.</p><p>\u201cDepends, is sleeping on your desk and nearly breaking your spine classify as sleeping well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh sarcasm? This early Cap? You must have had it rough. Here.\u201d</p><p>Steve is a bit confused but looking down he sees a cup of steaming hot coffee in Tony\u2019s outstretched hand and Steve\u2019s lips curve into a soft smile as the scent invades his senses. His hand wrap around the mug and saying \u2018thanks\u2019 in a low rumble before taking his first sip. The liquid is nearly scalding, and as it pools in his belly he feels a warmth blossoming within him and his smile becomes more like his usual one. Steve had been expecting one of Tony\u2019s experimental drinks, he and Bruce would often end their late night lab session coming up with ways to make coffee stronger, better, than the weak stuff Steve enjoyed.</p><p>He grew up on weak coffee; his mother Sarah would sometimes let Steve have a sip from her cup. In the mornings her messed blonde curls would be pushed back as she held the cup up to her nose taking in a deep breath before her first sip. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing better than good coffee and a warm smile in the morning, sunshine boy. Here have a taste and give me a smile\u2026\u201d</p><p>The echo of that early morning routine made his smile fade a bit before taking a second slower sip. Steve remembers her smile for that he was happy, and also thankful to Tony for making it the way Steve usually does.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t what you usually make in the mornings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured you would wake up better with this.\u201d</p><p>Tony had moved while Steve had been staring down into his mug, remembering those bright cheerful mornings with his mother. Steve watches as Tony plucks the toaster from its spot and whips out a small tool set wrapped in a soft leather case that he unfurls like a surgeons tools on the breakfast table.</p><p>\u201cToaster broken again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s one word answer didn\u2019t really help but Steve figured he could get the whole story out of Clint later. Steve sits in the chair opposite, his grumpy mood clearing with every sip; he tasted the smallest hint of sugar and felt a bit spoiled. Back then sugar was an extravagance and during the War coffee was too, the coffee rations were hard on everyone. It just made this seem like Tony was treating him, but to Tony this was nothing but a simple, weak in his opinion, cup of joe. Tony liked those fancy Italian coffees but Steve felt they were too rich for him. Sipping again blue eyes watch as Tony\u2019s fingers pull apart what had once been a functioning toaster. The morning is quiet and there is a sound of music coming from somewhere in the tower, Steve can\u2019t make out the words but he figures it\u2019s probably Tony who left his music on somewhere and just forgot to turn it off.</p><p>He feels\u2026 content, not quite as tired as he smiles once more when Tony grumbles under his breath about archers complaining about toasters that don\u2019t heat the toast enough.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the coffee Shell head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank me when you\u2019ve had real coffee Steve, I don\u2019t want to be associated with that drink masquerading as coffee.\u201d</p><p>Another part is stripped in time to Tony\u2019s reply and Steve chuckles.</p><p>\u201cThis suits me just fine Tony.
