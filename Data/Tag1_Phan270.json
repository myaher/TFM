Of course he\nfirst and foremost had wanted to get familiar with the course layout again, but\nthey had also planned to see how the supersofts would fare on fastruns. The\nsoftest tyre compound was a new enigma every race, especially when it was warm\noutside - and it\u00a0<i>was</i>.</p><p>It was particularly warm in Belgium this year and the\ntemperature of the asphalt was even higher, making it hard to estimate the\nduration and liability of the tyres as well as the needed temperature to get\nenough grip.</p><p>He had had such a nice plan mapped out with his strategists.\nThe mercedes always had a hard time conserving the tyres, especially when it\nwas warm, so him and Valtteri had decided to split the work to make it easier\nfor both of them to get everything done in the three trainings. They needed to\nget that edge on their greatest opponent, Ferrari.</p><p>That workload had only become worse. He hadn\u2019t been able to\ntest much. Not that it been his fault - not at all.</p><p>The marshal driving him back on his little roller definitely\nknew something was up, but he didn\u2019t say anything, just trembled in fear when\ndan finally got down from the vehicle and wolfed out a \u201cthank you\u201d between\ngritted teeth.</p><p>Someone needed to pay for this.</p><p>He stormed into the Mercedes garage looking like a proper\nmaniac, all glowing eyes and red cheeks. He wasn\u2019t even just\u00a0<i>mad\u00a0</i>,\nhe was\u00a0<i>furious\u00a0</i>.</p><p>He had only tried passing the rookie. Okay, maybe he shouldn\u2019t\nhave done it in a turn. And maybe he had heard his team stating through the\nradio that the guy has had problems with oversteering from the beginning of the\ntraining. He knew how bad oversteering was, when the car did more than you told\nit to and you felt like losing control. And maybe he should have expected a\ncompletely new driver to break too hard, to force his tyres into locking and\nhis car to drift, pushing Dan off the track in the process. He should\u2019ve known\nbetter, maybe.</p><p>Dan\u2019s angered brain did not register that.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that guy think he\u2019s fuckin doing?\u201d he railed as\nsoon as he was inside, throwing his helmet somewhere in the general direction\nof his lockers and stomped towards his teamchef. \u201cHe is worse than Maldonado\nfor fuck\u2019s sake!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Dan.\u201d Toto Wolff was a bastion of calm. After\nworking with ill-tempered drivers - like Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg - he\nwas probably used to this. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit unfortunate, but it was an accident. You\nshouldn\u2019t have come so close to him, you know he\u2019s a rookie. It\u2019s his second\ntime in a Formula one car, what did you expect?\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s mood did not get much better with that statement. \u201cI\nexpect him to know I have the fucking superiour car and\u00a0<i>let me\npass\u00a0</i>!\u201d He was practically fuming now, and he wouldn\u2019t be too\nsurprised if there would be actual steam coming out of his nose when he exhaled\nthrough it loudly.</p><p>\u201cYou were overtaking him too closely for doing it in a turn.\nEspecially because we told you he\u2019s had oversteering since the beginning of the\nsession.There wasn\u2019t much space for him, and then he wanted to break in the\nturn, got a full lockup and started skidding. I understand you\u2019re frustrated,\nbut we got to be reasonable here, it was an accident\u201d, Toto stated, still as\ncalm as ever. Dan was gritting his teeth harder, trying to figure out how to\nrespond to this.\u00a0<br/>\nIn the end, he did what he always did when he didn\u2019t know stuff. He stormed\noff.</p><p>\u201cYou got to get to the press area after checkup, Dan!\u201d, Toto\nshouted after him and Dan sighed. \u201cFuck\u201d, he murmured under his breath. This\nwould be a looong day.</p><p>When he finally got to the press area after a quick checkup\n- he was completely fine, luckily - there were still a few minutes to go in the\nfirst training. Aside from him and Phil only Magnussen had been going off\ncourse so far - which was surprising, especially considering it was the first\nrace after the summer break - so\u00a0<i>they\u00a0</i>were already waiting for\nhim when he arrived. He suppressed a shudder. He\u2019d have to look like he was\nokay with what had happened today, even if he was still practically fumming\ninside. -</p><p>\u201cHere goes nothing\u201d, he thought, then he made his presence\nknown.</p><p>The media flung themselves at him like hyenas at a piece of\nmeat. He wouldn\u2019t be able to answer all the questions thrown his way even if he\ntried, so he refused to bother. Instead, he waited for them to calm down on\ntheir own and ask their questions in order.</p><p>He was just answering the question of a bald guy from german\nTV when ruckus arose within the group of reporters - he didn\u2019t even need to\nturn around to know who had finally found the way to the media zone. \u201cLester\u201d,\nhe stated in greeting without turning around, acting like he was still\nconcentrated on the reporter in front of him - which he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>He had already forgotten what the question even was, if he\nwas being honest.</p><p>\u201cDan Howell, oh my god, it\u2019s so nice to meet you!\u201d came an\nexcited voice from somewhere behind him and his eyes nearly bulged out of their\nholes. The\u00a0<i>idiot\u00a0</i>had just\u00a0<i>crashed\u00a0</i>into him\nand\u00a0<i>that\u00a0</i>was the first thing he said?!</p><p>He turned around in utter bewilderment. \u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0<i>nice\u00a0</i>to\u00a0<i>meet\nme\u00a0</i>?\u201d, he hissed under his breath, eyes narrowing dangerously.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d The black haired man in front of him was obviously\ncompletely unaware of Dan\u2019s more than foul mood. He was still in the Williams\nracing suit, but he had the top half unscrewed, hanging off of his hips, only a\ntight tank top covering his torso. He was quite fit and Dan certainly did\u00a0<i>not</i>check\nhim out. Definitely not.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen you racing for years! I\u2019m quite the fan! You\u2019re\namazing!\u201d A slender, pale hand got shoved into his direction and Dan screwed up\nhis face. \u201cI\u2019m Phil Lester. But you probably already knew that. Everyone knows\nthat. I\u2019m the new kid in school here&hellip;\u201d</p><p>He rambled on for longer and Dan was starting to wonder if\nthe guy\u00a0<i>ever\u00a0</i>shut up. He was so perplexed he nearly forgot to\nstay mad at the guy, instead shook his hand in something close to a trance\nbefore the noises of running engines in the distance reminded him why he was\neven here. He let Phil\u2019s hand drop like he had burned himself and resumed his\ncold expression. \u201cIs that all you have to say to me?\u201d, he asked, speaking\nthrough Phil\u2019s ramblings like he wasn\u2019t even there, voice exceptionally calm\nbut so cold it could have frozen over hell itself.</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d Phil finally halted his talking, blinking confusedly.\n\u201cYes, why, do we know each other?\u201d He tilted his head to the side, puzzled look\non his face, and it was so cute Dan just wanted so barf.</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d he hissed out, close to stomping his foot\non the pavement like a child. Was the guy even for\u00a0<i>real\u00a0</i>?</p><p>Phil, the\u00a0<i>idiot\u00a0</i>, looked at him like he\ndidn\u2019t understand a thing, blue eyes big in silent wonder.</p><p>Dan growled under his breath and clenched his fist so hard\nhis nails were digging into his skin. \u201cWe crashed?\u201d he said quietly, nearly\ninaudible, and somewhere in the back of his mind he was aware Toto would\nprobably\u00a0<i>kill\u00a0</i>him later if he\u2019d flip out. Again. After the\nstunt he pulled before the summer break with that poor reporter&hellip; \u201cLike,\nliterally a few minutes ago?\u201d</p><p>Understanding dawned on his face and a grin stretched across\nit. \u201cAh, of course, right! I wanted to say sorry for that! I was told it was\nmostly a racing incident and I watched it through and it was my fault but it happens.\nI\u2019m still a rookie, you know, and you really can\u2019t compare Formula 3 to this\nand -\u201d</p><p>That was the point where Dan had enough of this stupid guy\nand his stupid grin and his stupid sexiness and his stupid, cute rambling and -\nhe just snapped.</p><p>\u201cAre you\njoking?\u201d, he started screaming, not even caring about the reporters behind him.\nHe could hear them frantically getting their cameras ready, could hear their\nwhispers and scanalized tones. He knew Toto would be fucking\u00a0<i>furious\u00a0</i>with\nhim. He knew he could potentially make an enemy of someone that would probably\nstay in formula one and climb the teams and proceed to be his biggest opponent\none day.</p><p>He didn\u2019t\ncare.</p><p><i>He just\ndidn\u2019t care.</i></p><p>\u201cYou rammed\nstraight into me! You completely threw away every and all calculations we did!\nand now you refuse to say\u00a0<i>sorry\u00a0</i>?\u201d He scoffed disdainfully,\nthrowing the Williams driver a withering look that was so chilling he visibly\nshrank under it. \u201cYou are ridiculous. No wonder you didn\u2019t get here earlier.\nYou only got lucky Sirotkin broke his leg or otherwise you wouldn\u2019t even stand\nhere. You\u2019d still be vegetating somewhere in formula three or wherever the hell\nthey need amateur drivers like you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t\neven knew what he was saying anymore, just let his anger out the easiest way he\ncould. He didn\u2019t mean any of it. Phil Lester had done a good job for Ferrari in\nformula three, he was at least a decent driver. And yes, he did get lucky when\nSirotkin broke his leg, rendering him unable to drive for at least a few months,\nhowever Williams still had had their surrogate driver that could\u2019ve easily\ntaken the seat - but they didn\u2019t let him. They got the tall, lanky brit\ninstead, making it even harder for the team to get the car ready in time. Just\nbecause they clearly estimated him as the superior driver.</p><p><i>Technically\u00a0</i>, Dan knew that.\u00a0<i>Technically\u00a0</i>,\nDan was aware of how hard it was to get into formula one if you didn\u2019t have the\nright connections or big enough wallet.</p><p><i>Technically\u00a0</i>.</p><p>In reality\nthough Dan was so anger-ridden, his thoughts so fogged up with fury that his\nbrain refused to process these facts into the right sentences. It was normal\nfor formula one drivers to insult each other, even going as far as getting into\nbrawls sometimes, but still - Dan\u00a0<i>definitely\u00a0</i>wasn\u2019t proud of\nhimself.</p><p>Maybe that\nwas the reason he felt guilt creeping down his body, setting somewhere near his\nbelly button; a frigid, unpalatable feeling that made his stomach turn.\u00a0</p><p>Or maybe\nthe reason for said guilt was the look on Phil\u2019s face.</p><p>Dan could pinpoint\nthe exact moment Phil\u2019s heart broke into a million pieces. The exact moment he\nhad fucked up.</p><p>The whole\ntime his face had spoken of nothing but surprise, maybe a bit of hurt. But when\nhe said the term\u00a0<i>amateur driver\u00a0</i>, it all crumbled into dust. There\nwas nothing left than devastation. Tears were forming in his eyes, highlighting\ntheir stunning blue colour even more until Dan was falling,\u00a0<i>drowning\u00a0</i>,\nunable to pull himself up again.</p><p>It was the\nsudden rustling sound of the reporters that got him back to earth. For a brief\nmoment, just for a split second he felt the urge to backtrack, to take back\neverything he had said. For a single moment, he wondered what it would be like\nto be a normal guy - but he wasn\u2019t. He was a racing driver. He couldn\u2019t allow\nhimself to admit fucking up - to look\u00a0<i>weak\u00a0</i>. Especially not in\nfront of so many running cameras. He had to stick with his words and face the\nconsequences.</p><p>So instead\nof retreating, of apologizing profusely and trying to repair everything that he\nhad just destroyed, he did what he did best. He bolted.</p><p>With\nseemingly confident steps and a stone cold expression he walked away,\nintentionally nudging Phil\u2019s shoulder with his own on the way. The Williams\ndriver still stood there, frozen in place, obviously unable to move. A single\ntear was running down his cheek and Dan felt his heart cracking under an\nenormous weight.</p><p>On his way\nback to the boxes he brushed past Nico H\u00fclkenberg, who was sporting a shocked\nexpression and turned around to follow him with his eyes.

Of course he\nfirst and foremost had wanted to get familiar with the course layout again, but\nthey had also planned to see how the supersofts would fare on fastruns. The\nsoftest tyre compound was a new enigma every race, especially when it was warm\noutside - and it\u00a0<i>was</i>.</p><p>It was particularly warm in Belgium this year and the\ntemperature of the asphalt was even higher, making it hard to estimate the\nduration and liability of the tyres as well as the needed temperature to get\nenough grip.</p><p>He had had such a nice plan mapped out with his strategists.\nThe mercedes always had a hard time conserving the tyres, especially when it\nwas warm, so him and Valtteri had decided to split the work to make it easier\nfor both of them to get everything done in the three trainings. They needed to\nget that edge on their greatest opponent, Ferrari.</p><p>That workload had only become worse. He hadn\u2019t been able to\ntest much. Not that it been his fault - not at all.</p><p>The marshal driving him back on his little roller definitely\nknew something was up, but he didn\u2019t say anything, just trembled in fear when\ndan finally got down from the vehicle and wolfed out a \u201cthank you\u201d between\ngritted teeth.</p><p>Someone needed to pay for this.</p><p>He stormed into the Mercedes garage looking like a proper\nmaniac, all glowing eyes and red cheeks. He wasn\u2019t even just\u00a0<i>mad\u00a0</i>,\nhe was\u00a0<i>furious\u00a0</i>.</p><p>He had only tried passing the rookie. Okay, maybe he shouldn\u2019t\nhave done it in a turn. And maybe he had heard his team stating through the\nradio that the guy has had problems with oversteering from the beginning of the\ntraining. He knew how bad oversteering was, when the car did more than you told\nit to and you felt like losing control. And maybe he should have expected a\ncompletely new driver to break too hard, to force his tyres into locking and\nhis car to drift, pushing Dan off the track in the process. He should\u2019ve known\nbetter, maybe.</p><p>Dan\u2019s angered brain did not register that.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that guy think he\u2019s fuckin doing?\u201d he railed as\nsoon as he was inside, throwing his helmet somewhere in the general direction\nof his lockers and stomped towards his teamchef. \u201cHe is worse than Maldonado\nfor fuck\u2019s sake!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Dan.\u201d Toto Wolff was a bastion of calm. After\nworking with ill-tempered drivers - like Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg - he\nwas probably used to this. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit unfortunate, but it was an accident. You\nshouldn\u2019t have come so close to him, you know he\u2019s a rookie. It\u2019s his second\ntime in a Formula one car, what did you expect?\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s mood did not get much better with that statement. \u201cI\nexpect him to know I have the fucking superiour car and\u00a0<i>let me\npass\u00a0</i>!\u201d He was practically fuming now, and he wouldn\u2019t be too\nsurprised if there would be actual steam coming out of his nose when he exhaled\nthrough it loudly.</p><p>\u201cYou were overtaking him too closely for doing it in a turn.\nEspecially because we told you he\u2019s had oversteering since the beginning of the\nsession.There wasn\u2019t much space for him, and then he wanted to break in the\nturn, got a full lockup and started skidding. I understand you\u2019re frustrated,\nbut we got to be reasonable here, it was an accident\u201d, Toto stated, still as\ncalm as ever. Dan was gritting his teeth harder, trying to figure out how to\nrespond to this.\u00a0<br>\nIn the end, he did what he always did when he didn\u2019t know stuff. He stormed\noff.</p><p>\u201cYou got to get to the press area after checkup, Dan!\u201d, Toto\nshouted after him and Dan sighed. \u201cFuck\u201d, he murmured under his breath. This\nwould be a looong day.</p><p>When he finally got to the press area after a quick checkup\n- he was completely fine, luckily - there were still a few minutes to go in the\nfirst training. Aside from him and Phil only Magnussen had been going off\ncourse so far - which was surprising, especially considering it was the first\nrace after the summer break - so\u00a0<i>they\u00a0</i>were already waiting for\nhim when he arrived. He suppressed a shudder. He\u2019d have to look like he was\nokay with what had happened today, even if he was still practically fumming\ninside. -</p><p>\u201cHere goes nothing\u201d, he thought, then he made his presence\nknown.</p><p>The media flung themselves at him like hyenas at a piece of\nmeat. He wouldn\u2019t be able to answer all the questions thrown his way even if he\ntried, so he refused to bother. Instead, he waited for them to calm down on\ntheir own and ask their questions in order.</p><p>He was just answering the question of a bald guy from german\nTV when ruckus arose within the group of reporters - he didn\u2019t even need to\nturn around to know who had finally found the way to the media zone. \u201cLester\u201d,\nhe stated in greeting without turning around, acting like he was still\nconcentrated on the reporter in front of him - which he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>He had already forgotten what the question even was, if he\nwas being honest.</p><p>\u201cDan Howell, oh my god, it\u2019s so nice to meet you!\u201d came an\nexcited voice from somewhere behind him and his eyes nearly bulged out of their\nholes. The\u00a0<i>idiot\u00a0</i>had just\u00a0<i>crashed\u00a0</i>into him\nand\u00a0<i>that\u00a0</i>was the first thing he said?!</p><p>He turned around in utter bewilderment. \u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0<i>nice\u00a0</i>to\u00a0<i>meet\nme\u00a0</i>?\u201d, he hissed under his breath, eyes narrowing dangerously.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d The black haired man in front of him was obviously\ncompletely unaware of Dan\u2019s more than foul mood. He was still in the Williams\nracing suit, but he had the top half unscrewed, hanging off of his hips, only a\ntight tank top covering his torso. He was quite fit and Dan certainly did\u00a0<i>not</i>check\nhim out. Definitely not.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen you racing for years! I\u2019m quite the fan! You\u2019re\namazing!\u201d A slender, pale hand got shoved into his direction and Dan screwed up\nhis face. \u201cI\u2019m Phil Lester. But you probably already knew that. Everyone knows\nthat. I\u2019m the new kid in school here\u2026\u201d</p><p>He rambled on for longer and Dan was starting to wonder if\nthe guy\u00a0<i>ever\u00a0</i>shut up. He was so perplexed he nearly forgot to\nstay mad at the guy, instead shook his hand in something close to a trance\nbefore the noises of running engines in the distance reminded him why he was\neven here. He let Phil\u2019s hand drop like he had burned himself and resumed his\ncold expression. \u201cIs that all you have to say to me?\u201d, he asked, speaking\nthrough Phil\u2019s ramblings like he wasn\u2019t even there, voice exceptionally calm\nbut so cold it could have frozen over hell itself.</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d Phil finally halted his talking, blinking confusedly.\n\u201cYes, why, do we know each other?\u201d He tilted his head to the side, puzzled look\non his face, and it was so cute Dan just wanted so barf.</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d he hissed out, close to stomping his foot\non the pavement like a child. Was the guy even for\u00a0<i>real\u00a0</i>?</p><p>Phil, the\u00a0<i>idiot\u00a0</i>, looked at him like he\ndidn\u2019t understand a thing, blue eyes big in silent wonder.</p><p>Dan growled under his breath and clenched his fist so hard\nhis nails were digging into his skin. \u201cWe crashed?\u201d he said quietly, nearly\ninaudible, and somewhere in the back of his mind he was aware Toto would\nprobably\u00a0<i>kill\u00a0</i>him later if he\u2019d flip out.

Of course he\nfirst and foremost had wanted to get familiar with the course layout again, but\nthey had also planned to see how the supersofts would fare on fastruns. The\nsoftest tyre compound was a new enigma every race, especially when it was warm\noutside - and it\u00a0<i>was</i>.</p><p>It was particularly warm in Belgium this year and the\ntemperature of the asphalt was even higher, making it hard to estimate the\nduration and liability of the tyres as well as the needed temperature to get\nenough grip.</p><p>He had had such a nice plan mapped out with his strategists.\nThe mercedes always had a hard time conserving the tyres, especially when it\nwas warm, so him and Valtteri had decided to split the work to make it easier\nfor both of them to get everything done in the three trainings. They needed to\nget that edge on their greatest opponent, Ferrari.</p><p>That workload had only become worse. He hadn\u2019t been able to\ntest much. Not that it been his fault - not at all.</p><p>The marshal driving him back on his little roller definitely\nknew something was up, but he didn\u2019t say anything, just trembled in fear when\ndan finally got down from the vehicle and wolfed out a \u201cthank you\u201d between\ngritted teeth.</p><p>Someone needed to pay for this.</p><p>He stormed into the Mercedes garage looking like a proper\nmaniac, all glowing eyes and red cheeks. He wasn\u2019t even just\u00a0<i>mad\u00a0</i>,\nhe was\u00a0<i>furious\u00a0</i>.</p><p>He had only tried passing the rookie. Okay, maybe he shouldn\u2019t\nhave done it in a turn. And maybe he had heard his team stating through the\nradio that the guy has had problems with oversteering from the beginning of the\ntraining. He knew how bad oversteering was, when the car did more than you told\nit to and you felt like losing control. And maybe he should have expected a\ncompletely new driver to break too hard, to force his tyres into locking and\nhis car to drift, pushing Dan off the track in the process. He should\u2019ve known\nbetter, maybe.</p><p>Dan\u2019s angered brain did not register that.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that guy think he\u2019s fuckin doing?\u201d he railed as\nsoon as he was inside, throwing his helmet somewhere in the general direction\nof his lockers and stomped towards his teamchef. \u201cHe is worse than Maldonado\nfor fuck\u2019s sake!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Dan.\u201d Toto Wolff was a bastion of calm. After\nworking with ill-tempered drivers - like Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg - he\nwas probably used to this. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit unfortunate, but it was an accident. You\nshouldn\u2019t have come so close to him, you know he\u2019s a rookie. It\u2019s his second\ntime in a Formula one car, what did you expect?\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s mood did not get much better with that statement. \u201cI\nexpect him to know I have the fucking superiour car and\u00a0<i>let me\npass\u00a0</i>!\u201d He was practically fuming now, and he wouldn\u2019t be too\nsurprised if there would be actual steam coming out of his nose when he exhaled\nthrough it loudly.</p><p>\u201cYou were overtaking him too closely for doing it in a turn.\nEspecially because we told you he\u2019s had oversteering since the beginning of the\nsession.There wasn\u2019t much space for him, and then he wanted to break in the\nturn, got a full lockup and started skidding. I understand you\u2019re frustrated,\nbut we got to be reasonable here, it was an accident\u201d, Toto stated, still as\ncalm as ever. Dan was gritting his teeth harder, trying to figure out how to\nrespond to this.\u00a0<br>\nIn the end, he did what he always did when he didn\u2019t know stuff. He stormed\noff.</p><p>\u201cYou got to get to the press area after checkup, Dan!\u201d, Toto\nshouted after him and Dan sighed. \u201cFuck\u201d, he murmured under his breath. This\nwould be a looong day.</p><p>When he finally got to the press area after a quick checkup\n- he was completely fine, luckily - there were still a few minutes to go in the\nfirst training. Aside from him and Phil only Magnussen had been going off\ncourse so far - which was surprising, especially considering it was the first\nrace after the summer break - so\u00a0<i>they\u00a0</i>were already waiting for\nhim when he arrived. He suppressed a shudder. He\u2019d have to look like he was\nokay with what had happened today, even if he was still practically fumming\ninside. -</p><p>\u201cHere goes nothing\u201d, he thought, then he made his presence\nknown.</p><p>The media flung themselves at him like hyenas at a piece of\nmeat. He wouldn\u2019t be able to answer all the questions thrown his way even if he\ntried, so he refused to bother. Instead, he waited for them to calm down on\ntheir own and ask their questions in order.</p><p>He was just answering the question of a bald guy from german\nTV when ruckus arose within the group of reporters - he didn\u2019t even need to\nturn around to know who had finally found the way to the media zone. \u201cLester\u201d,\nhe stated in greeting without turning around, acting like he was still\nconcentrated on the reporter in front of him - which he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>He had already forgotten what the question even was, if he\nwas being honest.</p><p>\u201cDan Howell, oh my god, it\u2019s so nice to meet you!\u201d came an\nexcited voice from somewhere behind him and his eyes nearly bulged out of their\nholes. The\u00a0<i>idiot\u00a0</i>had just\u00a0<i>crashed\u00a0</i>into him\nand\u00a0<i>that\u00a0</i>was the first thing he said?!</p><p>He turned around in utter bewilderment. \u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0<i>nice\u00a0</i>to\u00a0<i>meet\nme\u00a0</i>?\u201d, he hissed under his breath, eyes narrowing dangerously.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d The black haired man in front of him was obviously\ncompletely unaware of Dan\u2019s more than foul mood. He was still in the Williams\nracing suit, but he had the top half unscrewed, hanging off of his hips, only a\ntight tank top covering his torso. He was quite fit and Dan certainly did\u00a0<i>not</i>check\nhim out. Definitely not.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen you racing for years! I\u2019m quite the fan! You\u2019re\namazing!\u201d A slender, pale hand got shoved into his direction and Dan screwed up\nhis face. \u201cI\u2019m Phil Lester. But you probably already knew that. Everyone knows\nthat. I\u2019m the new kid in school here\u2026\u201d</p><p>He rambled on for longer and Dan was starting to wonder if\nthe guy\u00a0<i>ever\u00a0</i>shut up. He was so perplexed he nearly forgot to\nstay mad at the guy, instead shook his hand in something close to a trance\nbefore the noises of running engines in the distance reminded him why he was\neven here. He let Phil\u2019s hand drop like he had burned himself and resumed his\ncold expression. \u201cIs that all you have to say to me?\u201d, he asked, speaking\nthrough Phil\u2019s ramblings like he wasn\u2019t even there, voice exceptionally calm\nbut so cold it could have frozen over hell itself.</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d Phil finally halted his talking, blinking confusedly.\n\u201cYes, why, do we know each other?\u201d He tilted his head to the side, puzzled look\non his face, and it was so cute Dan just wanted so barf.</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d he hissed out, close to stomping his foot\non the pavement like a child. Was the guy even for\u00a0<i>real\u00a0</i>?</p><p>Phil, the\u00a0<i>idiot\u00a0</i>, looked at him like he\ndidn\u2019t understand a thing, blue eyes big in silent wonder.</p><p>Dan growled under his breath and clenched his fist so hard\nhis nails were digging into his skin. \u201cWe crashed?\u201d he said quietly, nearly\ninaudible, and somewhere in the back of his mind he was aware Toto would\nprobably\u00a0<i>kill\u00a0</i>him later if he\u2019d flip out. Again. After the\nstunt he pulled before the summer break with that poor reporter\u2026 \u201cLike,\nliterally a few minutes ago?\u201d</p><p>Understanding dawned on his face and a grin stretched across\nit. \u201cAh, of course, right! I wanted to say sorry for that! I was told it was\nmostly a racing incident and I watched it through and it was my fault but it happens.\nI\u2019m still a rookie, you know, and you really can\u2019t compare Formula 3 to this\nand -\u201d</p><p>That was the point where Dan had enough of this stupid guy\nand his stupid grin and his stupid sexiness and his stupid, cute rambling and -\nhe just snapped.</p><p>\u201cAre you\njoking?\u201d, he started screaming, not even caring about the reporters behind him.\nHe could hear them frantically getting their cameras ready, could hear their\nwhispers and scanalized tones. He knew Toto would be fucking\u00a0<i>furious\u00a0</i>with\nhim. He knew he could potentially make an enemy of someone that would probably\nstay in formula one and climb the teams and proceed to be his biggest opponent\none day.</p><p>He didn\u2019t\ncare.</p><p><i>He just\ndidn\u2019t care.</i></p><p>\u201cYou rammed\nstraight into me! You completely threw away every and all calculations we did!\nand now you refuse to say\u00a0<i>sorry\u00a0</i>?\u201d He scoffed disdainfully,\nthrowing the Williams driver a withering look that was so chilling he visibly\nshrank under it. \u201cYou are ridiculous. No wonder you didn\u2019t get here earlier.\nYou only got lucky Sirotkin broke his leg or otherwise you wouldn\u2019t even stand\nhere. You\u2019d still be vegetating somewhere in formula three or wherever the hell\nthey need amateur drivers like you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t\neven knew what he was saying anymore, just let his anger out the easiest way he\ncould. He didn\u2019t mean any of it. Phil Lester had done a good job for Ferrari in\nformula three, he was at least a decent driver. And yes, he did get lucky when\nSirotkin broke his leg, rendering him unable to drive for at least a few months,\nhowever Williams still had had their surrogate driver that could\u2019ve easily\ntaken the seat - but they didn\u2019t let him. They got the tall, lanky brit\ninstead, making it even harder for the team to get the car ready in time. Just\nbecause they clearly estimated him as the superior driver.</p><p><i>Technically\u00a0</i>, Dan knew that.\u00a0<i>Technically\u00a0</i>,\nDan was aware of how hard it was to get into formula one if you didn\u2019t have the\nright connections or big enough wallet.</p><p><i>Technically\u00a0</i>.</p><p>In reality\nthough Dan was so anger-ridden, his thoughts so fogged up with fury that his\nbrain refused to process these facts into the right sentences. It was normal\nfor formula one drivers to insult each other, even going as far as getting into\nbrawls sometimes, but still - Dan\u00a0<i>definitely\u00a0</i>wasn\u2019t proud of\nhimself.</p><p>Maybe that\nwas the reason he felt guilt creeping down his body, setting somewhere near his\nbelly button; a frigid, unpalatable feeling that made his stomach turn.\u00a0</p><p>Or maybe\nthe reason for said guilt was the look on Phil\u2019s face.</p><p>Dan could pinpoint\nthe exact moment Phil\u2019s heart broke into a million pieces. The exact moment he\nhad fucked up.</p><p>The whole\ntime his face had spoken of nothing but surprise, maybe a bit of hurt. But when\nhe said the term\u00a0<i>amateur driver\u00a0</i>, it all crumbled into dust. There\nwas nothing left than devastation. Tears were forming in his eyes, highlighting\ntheir stunning blue colour even more until Dan was falling,\u00a0<i>drowning\u00a0</i>,\nunable to pull himself up again.</p><p>It was the\nsudden rustling sound of the reporters that got him back to earth. For a brief\nmoment, just for a split second he felt the urge to backtrack, to take back\neverything he had said. For a single moment, he wondered what it would be like\nto be a normal guy - but he wasn\u2019t. He was a racing driver. He couldn\u2019t allow\nhimself to admit fucking up - to look\u00a0<i>weak\u00a0</i>. Especially not in\nfront of so many running cameras. He had to stick with his words and face the\nconsequences.</p><p>So instead\nof retreating, of apologizing profusely and trying to repair everything that he\nhad just destroyed, he did what he did best. He bolted.</p><p>With\nseemingly confident steps and a stone cold expression he walked away,\nintentionally nudging Phil\u2019s shoulder with his own on the way. The Williams\ndriver still stood there, frozen in place, obviously unable to move. A single\ntear was running down his cheek and Dan felt his heart cracking under an\nenormous weight.</p><p>On his way\nback to the boxes he brushed past Nico H\u00fclkenberg, who was sporting a shocked\nexpression and turned around to follow him with his eyes. He could feel a\nreproachful look drilling into the back of his head, sending an unpleasant\nshiver down his spine.</p><p>He\npretended not to notice.</p><p>:::</p><p>Of course,\nToto was\u00a0<i>furious\u00a0</i>. For at least the rest of the weekend Dan\nwas almost certain he would get fired, or at least degraded back to formula\ntwo. That concern fortunately took his mind off of the situation with Phil\nLester, who had responded to his\u00a0<i>slight discourtesy\u00a0</i>with a\nspeech on his own, claiming that he had no idea what Dan\u2019s problem even was.</p><p>Dan was so\noccupied with worry over his job issues that he didn\u2019t dare adding anything\nelse to this discussion, only briefly touching upon the issue in an interview,\napologizing for his rash behaviour - as instructed by his raging teamchef.</p><p>Over the\ncourse of the season his relationship with Phil didn\u2019t get any better either.\nAfter Dan\u2019s brief apology, he originally decided to drop the issue, but when he\nrealized Phil still treated him with nothing but hostility and antipathy he\nrefused to let it slide.</p><p>That was\nhow, a few months later, he found himself in the situation he had predicted\nafter that faithfull first encounter: Leclerc, driver for Mercedes\u2019 greatest\nopponent Ferrari, didn\u2019t deliver the performance he had been contracted for and\ngot replaced at the end of the season - by none other than Phil Lester\u2026</p><p>It\u2019s needless to say that this was only the beginning.</p>",

He knew he could potentially make an enemy of someone that would probably\nstay in formula one and climb the teams and proceed to be his biggest opponent\none day.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t\ncare.</p><p><i>He just\ndidn&rsquo;t care.</i></p><p>&ldquo;You rammed\nstraight into me! You completely threw away every and all calculations we did!\nand now you refuse to say&nbsp;<i>sorry&nbsp;</i>?&rdquo; He scoffed disdainfully,\nthrowing the Williams driver a withering look that was so chilling he visibly\nshrank under it. &ldquo;You are ridiculous. No wonder you didn&rsquo;t get here earlier.\nYou only got lucky Sirotkin broke his leg or otherwise you wouldn&rsquo;t even stand\nhere. You&rsquo;d still be vegetating somewhere in formula three or wherever the hell\nthey need amateur drivers like you.&rdquo;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t\neven knew what he was saying anymore, just let his anger out the easiest way he\ncould. He didn&rsquo;t mean any of it. Phil Lester had done a good job for Ferrari in\nformula three, he was at least a decent driver. And yes, he did get lucky when\nSirotkin broke his leg, rendering him unable to drive for at least a few months,\nhowever Williams still had had their surrogate driver that could&rsquo;ve easily\ntaken the seat - but they didn&rsquo;t let him. They got the tall, lanky brit\ninstead, making it even harder for the team to get the car ready in time. Just\nbecause they clearly estimated him as the superior driver.</p><p><i>Technically&nbsp;</i>, Dan knew that.&nbsp;<i>Technically&nbsp;</i>,\nDan was aware of how hard it was to get into formula one if you didn&rsquo;t have the\nright connections or big enough wallet.</p><p><i>Technically&nbsp;</i>.</p><p>In reality\nthough Dan was so anger-ridden, his thoughts so fogged up with fury that his\nbrain refused to process these facts into the right sentences. It was normal\nfor formula one drivers to insult each other, even going as far as getting into\nbrawls sometimes, but still - Dan&nbsp;<i>definitely&nbsp;</i>wasn&rsquo;t proud of\nhimself.</p><p>Maybe that\nwas the reason he felt guilt creeping down his body, setting somewhere near his\nbelly button; a frigid, unpalatable feeling that made his stomach turn.&nbsp;</p><p>Or maybe\nthe reason for said guilt was the look on Phil&rsquo;s face.</p><p>Dan could pinpoint\nthe exact moment Phil&rsquo;s heart broke into a million pieces. The exact moment he\nhad fucked up.</p><p>The whole\ntime his face had spoken of nothing but surprise, maybe a bit of hurt. But when\nhe said the term&nbsp;<i>amateur driver&nbsp;</i>, it all crumbled into dust. There\nwas nothing left than devastation. Tears were forming in his eyes, highlighting\ntheir stunning blue colour even more until Dan was falling,&nbsp;<i>drowning&nbsp;</i>,\nunable to pull himself up again.</p><p>It was the\nsudden rustling sound of the reporters that got him back to earth. For a brief\nmoment, just for a split second he felt the urge to backtrack, to take back\neverything he had said. For a single moment, he wondered what it would be like\nto be a normal guy - but he wasn&rsquo;t. He was a racing driver. He couldn&rsquo;t allow\nhimself to admit fucking up - to look&nbsp;<i>weak&nbsp;</i>. Especially not in\nfront of so many running cameras. He had to stick with his words and face the\nconsequences.</p><p>So instead\nof retreating, of apologizing profusely and trying to repair everything that he\nhad just destroyed, he did what he did best. He bolted.</p><p>With\nseemingly confident steps and a stone cold expression he walked away,\nintentionally nudging Phil&rsquo;s shoulder with his own on the way. The Williams\ndriver still stood there, frozen in place, obviously unable to move. A single\ntear was running down his cheek and Dan felt his heart cracking under an\nenormous weight.</p><p>On his way\nback to the boxes he brushed past Nico H&uuml;lkenberg, who was sporting a shocked\nexpression and turned around to follow him with his eyes. He could feel a\nreproachful look drilling into the back of his head, sending an unpleasant\nshiver down his spine.</p><p>He\npretended not to notice.</p><p>:::</p><p>Of course,\nToto was&nbsp;<i>furious&nbsp;</i>. For at least the rest of the weekend Dan\nwas almost certain he would get fired, or at least degraded back to formula\ntwo. That concern fortunately took his mind off of the situation with Phil\nLester, who had responded to his&nbsp;<i>slight discourtesy&nbsp;</i>with a\nspeech on his own, claiming that he had no idea what Dan&rsquo;s problem even was.</p><p>Dan was so\noccupied with worry over his job issues that he didn&rsquo;t dare adding anything\nelse to this discussion, only briefly touching upon the issue in an interview,\napologizing for his rash behaviour - as instructed by his raging teamchef.</p><p>Over the\ncourse of the season his relationship with Phil didn&rsquo;t get any better either.\nAfter Dan&rsquo;s brief apology, he originally decided to drop the issue, but when he\nrealized Phil still treated him with nothing but hostility and antipathy he\nrefused to let it slide.</p><p>That was\nhow, a few months later, he found himself in the situation he had predicted\nafter that faithfull first encounter: Leclerc, driver for Mercedes&rsquo; greatest\nopponent Ferrari, didn&rsquo;t deliver the performance he had been contracted for and\ngot replaced at the end of the season - by none other than Phil Lester&hellip;</p><p>It&rsquo;s needless to say that this was only the beginning.</p>",

Worst case scenario, there are plenty of fish in the sea.\u201d</p><p>Phil listened, but he couldn\u2019t help but notice the way the barista seemed to be listening to their conversation, even as she filled their orders. He wasn\u2019t bothered by it per se \u2013 though it was rude to eavesdrop \u2013 but he couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she would care. He took his drink when she handed it to him, but it wasn\u2019t until he and his brother had sat down that he noticed she had written her number on the cup. \u201cOh. That\u2019s new,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Martyn leaned over to look at the cup, then glanced over towards the barista. \u201cShe\u2019s cute. You should text her.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cBut what if I do, and we date, and break up? I wouldn\u2019t be able to come back here again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo just go to a different Starbucks,\u201d Martyn shrugged.</p><p>Phil shook his head, \u201cI <i>can\u2019t</i>. This one\u2019s special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of Dan,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cWhich is what led us to this point in the first place. See? Full circle. Text her,\u201d there was a pause as he sensed his younger brother\u2019s hesitation. \u201cListen, I like Dan. I think he\u2019s a great guy. But I don\u2019t want you to get hung up on something that\u2019s still up in the air.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Phil set his cup back down and took a picture of her number. Just in case.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>\u201cAm I a bad person?\u201d Dan asked. While Phil was out with Martyn, he decided today would be best spent with a friend, especially one that knew both of them and was familiar with their situation.</p><p>\u201cBad people don\u2019t ask if they\u2019re bad,\u201d PJ replied, handing him a drink and sitting beside him with his own. \u201cWhat makes you think you are?\u201d</p><p>Dan took a swig of his drink, sighing heavily. \u201cI can see myself hurting Phil while I\u2019m doing it, and I keep telling myself that it\u2019s going to work out, that it\u2019s what we need. But each time I want to stop and just be with him. I\u2019m just\u2026\u201d he gestured vaguely, trying to find the right words. \u201cI\u2019m scared, I guess,\u201d he cringed at the confession, embarrassed that it was the case.</p><p>PJ furrowed his brows, shifting to face Dan instead of just sitting beside him. \u201cWhat are you scared of?\u201d</p><p>Silence filled the room as Dan searched for words. He wanted to explain how he felt, but at the same time, that put it into the world, it made everything real. \u201cI\u2019m scared of falling even more in love with him than I was before, and it\u2019ll hurt that much more when he realizes I\u2019m not worth the effort and kicks me to the curb. At this point it\u2019s what I deserve, though,\u201d he tilted his head back and blinked rapidly. He didn\u2019t want to cry, that was saved for him to do alone in his room in the middle of the night.</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t talk about yourself like that,\u201d PJ wrapped a comforting arm around him, pulling him closer. \u201cYou are worth effort and love and all of that. I know it\u2019s not as simple as saying \u2018go be with him because that\u2019s where your heart is\u2019 but you need to stop sabotaging yourself. Making him mad at you won\u2019t make you feel any better.\u201d</p><p>Dan sniffled, leaning into PJ\u2019s embrace while pointedly avoiding looking in his direction. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p><b>3/16/12 \u2013 1:07 PM</b></p><p>Dan glanced around when they entered the Starbucks. They were filming \u2018A Day in the Life\u2019 so of course they had to stop by their coffee shop and get their usual orders. It wouldn\u2019t be true to life without it. His stomach was in a knot and he kept fumbling with the sleeves of his jumper.</p><p>Phil kept the camera off him for that moment, until he decided to pause it long enough to ask, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>Dan glared at him and huffed. \u201cYou know who. <i>Charlotte</i>,\u201d the name was bitter on his tongue, and his face scrunched up as if it\u2019d created a foul odor as well. He then realized his subconscious reaction and quickly covered it up with, \u201cI just think it would be awkward if she were here while we\u2019re filming. If you start proper dating, it\u2019ll be even weirder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell she\u2019s not here, so you can unclench,\u201d Phil rolled his eyes. He waited for him to relax before turning the camera on and filming resumed. Overall, their outing went well, and it was nice to spend time together as friends, without the pressure of worrying about how their relationship would come off to their audience, or even the strangers they passed on the Manchester streets. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you like her, anyway? I figured you\u2019d be happy that I\u2019m trying to branch out.\u201d</p><p>Dan shook his head and looked down. \u201cI don\u2019t <i>not</i> like her. I just don\u2019t know anything about her, except that she makes a decent caramel macchiato. She could be a serial killer that\u2019s just good at hiding it for all we know.\u201d</p><p>Phil rolled his eyes fondly and laughed. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s something horribly unusual about her that\u2019ll make for a great video when we break up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit. By the way,\u201d he said as they were leaving, \u201cIf you do go beyond the \u2018texting and coffee dates\u2019 with her, and you guys break up, you\u2019re going to have to deal with it. We\u2019re not finding another Starbucks \u2013 that one\u2019s ours.\u201d</p><p>Phil looked over at Dan and smiled, bumping against his shoulder with his own. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d</p><p><b>3/28/12 \u2013 6:23 PM</b></p><p>\u201cSo, are you ignoring it, or do you just not care?\u201d Phil asked as he washed his hands.</p><p>Dan leaned against another sink in the mini golf men\u2019s room, folding his arms over his chest. \u201cWhat are you on about? You being a sore loser?\u201d he smirked.</p><p>\u201cFirst off, no I\u2019m not. Second, Cat was making eyes at you the whole time. She even did the thing where she asked you to \u2018adjust her position\u2019 so you\u2019d put your arms around her,\u201d Phil was amused by how oblivious Dan was to the girl\u2019s flirtation, even if watching people try to get with him made his chest tighten.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s just how she is, Phil,\u201d Dan chuckled. \u201cShe\u2019s\u2026bubbly and outgoing. It\u2019s not what we\u2019re used to,\u201d he did suspect that Cat had a crush on him, and he didn\u2019t mind it. But he felt like engaging in anything with another youtuber was hypocritical considering everything he had put Phil through for similar reasons. If he ignored the issue, it would go away, right?</p><p>Phil tilted his head in thought, then a small smirk tugged at his lips. \u201cHow about we figure it out for sure? She\u2019s never been alone with you before. Tomorrow, when we film, I\u2019ll go out to get food and you see what happens.\u201d</p><p>They headed out of the bathroom, Dan shoving his hands in his pockets. \u201cYou\u2019re on,\u201d he told him before they rejoined the girl and left the mini golf course, deciding to go out for dinner before returning to their respective hotel rooms and heading to a local diner.</p><p>\u201cYou guys have gotten crazy popular lately, has that made it harder to date?\u201d Cat asked them with what appeared to be sincere curiosity. She was sat next to Dan, who was sitting across from Phil, as she took the seat next to him before the other had a chance.</p><p>Neither of them answered at first, waiting for the other to take the lead. Phil finally did so by saying \u201cWell, you know, it can be complicated. We want to maintain a certain image for the fans and getting into a new, serious relationship could throw a wrench in things,\u201d he was admittedly proud of his diplomatic response, and looking over at Dan, it appeared that he deemed it acceptable as well.</p><p>\u201cSo, no serious relationships? Duly noted,\u201d Cat had a wide grin on her lips, one that caused Phil to shoot Dan a subtle, but knowing look.</p><p><b>3/29/12 \u2013 5:51 PM</b></p><p>\u201cYou guys getting hungry?\u201d Phil asked. They had spent the whole afternoon filming and working on the video and were just about ready to call it a day. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go hitch a quick ride into town to get some food,\u201d he told them as he got up. He took their lunch orders and again, gave Dan another knowing look before leaving.</p><p>Dan had got up from the filming spot as well, shifting up to sit on the edge of the bed, phone in hand, figuring he would check his email as he planned on how to address what he and Phil had discussed. He glanced over at Cat, who looked quite pleased to be alone with him.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d without waiting for a response, she continued. \u201cWhat are you and Phil? You can tell me, seriously.\u201d</p><p>Of all the things he had expected her to ask, his relationship with Phil hadn\u2019t even made it on to the radar. Dan was blindsided and wasn\u2019t sure how to respond. He considered, for a moment, telling her the truth \u2013 that he and Phil had been dating for nearly three years, but stepped away from the \u2018boyfriend\u2019 label to help ease the pressure they were facing from the outside world. In a split-second decision, however, he changed his mind. Even if Cat was their friend, he wasn\u2019t close enough to her to fully trust her with that knowledge. \u201cWe\u2019re friends, silly. Really good friends, but that\u2019s it, I promise,\u201d he forced out a laugh, hoping it would be enough to convince her.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s all there is to it? Because I\u2019ve been making it pretty clear that I\u2019m, you know, \u2018DTF\u2019, and you never notice because you\u2019re looking at Phil, or laughing at a joke he made. And I mean listen, I\u2019m not claiming to be some sort of irresistible Aphrodite, but I feel like most single, straight guys would acknowledge it,\u201d her tone was a mix of accusatory and offended, both of which rubbed Dan the wrong way.</p><p>Dan got up, crossing his arms. His brows knitted together, and his gaze was on the floor. \u201cSo, just because I\u2019m not interested in fucking you, I\u2019m gay for my best friend?\u201d he lifted his gaze to glare at her, his words as heated as his face was getting.</p><p>Cat recoiled at his harshness, standing up and taking a half-step back. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that! I\u2019m saying you live with the guy and still want to spend all your time with him, to the point you didn\u2019t even <i>notice</i> I wanted to fuck you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my <i>friend</i>, of course I like being around him! I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t smart enough to pick up on your apparently obvious hints, but that doesn\u2019t mean shit,\u201d this wasn\u2019t the way it was supposed to go down. He was only planning on finding out if Cat fancied him or not, not get into an argument with her about it.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you getting so defensive?\u201d she snapped, her jaw clenched.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re accusing me of a hell of a lot since you got your feelings hurt,\u201d in some part of his brain, he knew that she was a victim in this \u2013 her actions didn\u2019t warrant this anger from him. But he had gotten on this train and it felt impossible to get off. \u201cWhat Phil and I do is none of your fucking business.\u201d</p><p>Cat quirked her brow at that. \u201cOh, so you are doing something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I mean, it doesn\u2019t matter if we were, it\u2019s not your place to ask,\u201d he huffed.</p><p>\u201cLook, my feelings aside, I\u2019m still your friend, and his. Friends don\u2019t keep secrets from each other just to look good. Look me in the eyes and tell me you don\u2019t have any feelings for him, and I\u2019ll drop it.\u201d</p><p>Dan felt backed into the corner, fidgeting in agitation and struggling to look into her eyes. \u201cFine! I\u2026I-I\u2026fucking damn it,\u201d it wasn\u2019t like handling himself online, where he was in control and say he and Phil were just friends until he was blue in the face. But being put on the spot made him shut down, he could hardly see straight, let alone tell a convincing lie. \u201cThere, whatever. I can\u2019t do it. Happy?\u201d</p><p>There was another pause before Cat replied. \u201cWell, no\u2026I feel bad that you feel like you have to hide, that being honest with a friend had to be dragged out of you. Maybe I should have had a separate conversation from the sexual attraction thing\u2026\u201d she looked down, guilt written on her face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more than willing to pretend this never happened,\u201d Dan offered, expression softening, only to tense back up when a male voice cleared its throat.</p><p>\u201cFood\u2019s here,\u201d Phil said, holding up the bag with one hand and waving awkwardly with the other.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get back?\u201d Dan asked, going back to looking exclusively at the floor. He had memorized the carpet pattern by now.</p><p>Phil walked towards the desk to set the food down, taking that moment to not have to look at either of them. \u201cIn the middle of Cat\u2019s ultimatum.\u201d</p><p>Dan groaned, flopping backwards on to the bed. \u201cI wanna go home,\u201d he whined.</p><p>Sometime down the line he would properly apologize to Cat, but in the meantime, he knew he had to get through the rest of their stay with the hopes he didn\u2019t cause irrevocable damage to his friendship with her.</p>",

They were filming \u2018A Day in the Life\u2019 so of course they had to stop by their coffee shop and get their usual orders. It wouldn\u2019t be true to life without it. His stomach was in a knot and he kept fumbling with the sleeves of his jumper.</p><p>Phil kept the camera off him for that moment, until he decided to pause it long enough to ask, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>Dan glared at him and huffed. \u201cYou know who. <i>Charlotte</i>,\u201d the name was bitter on his tongue, and his face scrunched up as if it\u2019d created a foul odor as well. He then realized his subconscious reaction and quickly covered it up with, \u201cI just think it would be awkward if she were here while we\u2019re filming. If you start proper dating, it\u2019ll be even weirder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell she\u2019s not here, so you can unclench,\u201d Phil rolled his eyes. He waited for him to relax before turning the camera on and filming resumed. Overall, their outing went well, and it was nice to spend time together as friends, without the pressure of worrying about how their relationship would come off to their audience, or even the strangers they passed on the Manchester streets. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you like her, anyway? I figured you\u2019d be happy that I\u2019m trying to branch out.\u201d</p><p>Dan shook his head and looked down. \u201cI don\u2019t <i>not</i> like her. I just don\u2019t know anything about her, except that she makes a decent caramel macchiato. She could be a serial killer that\u2019s just good at hiding it for all we know.\u201d</p><p>Phil rolled his eyes fondly and laughed. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s something horribly unusual about her that\u2019ll make for a great video when we break up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit. By the way,\u201d he said as they were leaving, \u201cIf you do go beyond the \u2018texting and coffee dates\u2019 with her, and you guys break up, you\u2019re going to have to deal with it. We\u2019re not finding another Starbucks \u2013 that one\u2019s ours.\u201d</p><p>Phil looked over at Dan and smiled, bumping against his shoulder with his own. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d</p><p><b>3/28/12 \u2013 6:23 PM</b></p><p>\u201cSo, are you ignoring it, or do you just not care?\u201d Phil asked as he washed his hands.</p><p>Dan leaned against another sink in the mini golf men\u2019s room, folding his arms over his chest. \u201cWhat are you on about? You being a sore loser?\u201d he smirked.</p><p>\u201cFirst off, no I\u2019m not. Second, Cat was making eyes at you the whole time. She even did the thing where she asked you to \u2018adjust her position\u2019 so you\u2019d put your arms around her,\u201d Phil was amused by how oblivious Dan was to the girl\u2019s flirtation, even if watching people try to get with him made his chest tighten.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s just how she is, Phil,\u201d Dan chuckled. \u201cShe\u2019s\u2026bubbly and outgoing. It\u2019s not what we\u2019re used to,\u201d he did suspect that Cat had a crush on him, and he didn\u2019t mind it. But he felt like engaging in anything with another youtuber was hypocritical considering everything he had put Phil through for similar reasons. If he ignored the issue, it would go away, right?</p><p>Phil tilted his head in thought, then a small smirk tugged at his lips. \u201cHow about we figure it out for sure? She\u2019s never been alone with you before. Tomorrow, when we film, I\u2019ll go out to get food and you see what happens.\u201d</p><p>They headed out of the bathroom, Dan shoving his hands in his pockets. \u201cYou\u2019re on,\u201d he told him before they rejoined the girl and left the mini golf course, deciding to go out for dinner before returning to their respective hotel rooms and heading to a local diner.</p><p>\u201cYou guys have gotten crazy popular lately, has that made it harder to date?\u201d Cat asked them with what appeared to be sincere curiosity. She was sat next to Dan, who was sitting across from Phil, as she took the seat next to him before the other had a chance.</p><p>Neither of them answered at first, waiting for the other to take the lead. Phil finally did so by saying \u201cWell, you know, it can be complicated. We want to maintain a certain image for the fans and getting into a new, serious relationship could throw a wrench in things,\u201d he was admittedly proud of his diplomatic response, and looking over at Dan, it appeared that he deemed it acceptable as well.</p><p>\u201cSo, no serious relationships? Duly noted,\u201d Cat had a wide grin on her lips, one that caused Phil to shoot Dan a subtle, but knowing look.</p><p><b>3/29/12 \u2013 5:51 PM</b></p><p>\u201cYou guys getting hungry?\u201d Phil asked. They had spent the whole afternoon filming and working on the video and were just about ready to call it a day. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go hitch a quick ride into town to get some food,\u201d he told them as he got up. He took their lunch orders and again, gave Dan another knowing look before leaving.</p><p>Dan had got up from the filming spot as well, shifting up to sit on the edge of the bed, phone in hand, figuring he would check his email as he planned on how to address what he and Phil had discussed. He glanced over at Cat, who looked quite pleased to be alone with him.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d without waiting for a response, she continued. \u201cWhat are you and Phil? You can tell me, seriously.\u201d</p><p>Of all the things he had expected her to ask, his relationship with Phil hadn\u2019t even made it on to the radar. Dan was blindsided and wasn\u2019t sure how to respond. He considered, for a moment, telling her the truth \u2013 that he and Phil had been dating for nearly three years, but stepped away from the \u2018boyfriend\u2019 label to help ease the pressure they were facing from the outside world. In a split-second decision, however, he changed his mind. Even if Cat was their friend, he wasn\u2019t close enough to her to fully trust her with that knowledge. \u201cWe\u2019re friends, silly. Really good friends, but that\u2019s it, I promise,\u201d he forced out a laugh, hoping it would be enough to convince her.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s all there is to it? Because I\u2019ve been making it pretty clear that I\u2019m, you know, \u2018DTF\u2019, and you never notice because you\u2019re looking at Phil, or laughing at a joke he made. And I mean listen, I\u2019m not claiming to be some sort of irresistible Aphrodite, but I feel like most single, straight guys would acknowledge it,\u201d her tone was a mix of accusatory and offended, both of which rubbed Dan the wrong way.</p><p>Dan got up, crossing his arms. His brows knitted together, and his gaze was on the floor. \u201cSo, just because I\u2019m not interested in fucking you, I\u2019m gay for my best friend?\u201d he lifted his gaze to glare at her, his words as heated as his face was getting.</p><p>Cat recoiled at his harshness, standing up and taking a half-step back. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that! I\u2019m saying you live with the guy and still want to spend all your time with him, to the point you didn\u2019t even <i>notice</i> I wanted to fuck you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my <i>friend</i>, of course I like being around him! I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t smart enough to pick up on your apparently obvious hints, but that doesn\u2019t mean shit,\u201d this wasn\u2019t the way it was supposed to go down. He was only planning on finding out if Cat fancied him or not, not get into an argument with her about it.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you getting so defensive?\u201d she snapped, her jaw clenched.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re accusing me of a hell of a lot since you got your feelings hurt,\u201d in some part of his brain, he knew that she was a victim in this \u2013 her actions didn\u2019t warrant this anger from him. But he had gotten on this train and it felt impossible to get off. \u201cWhat Phil and I do is none of your fucking business.\u201d</p><p>Cat quirked her brow at that. \u201cOh, so you are doing something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I mean, it doesn\u2019t matter if we were, it\u2019s not your place to ask,\u201d he huffed.</p><p>\u201cLook, my feelings aside, I\u2019m still your friend, and his. Friends don\u2019t keep secrets from each other just to look good. Look me in the eyes and tell me you don\u2019t have any feelings for him, and I\u2019ll drop it.\u201d</p><p>Dan felt backed into the corner, fidgeting in agitation and struggling to look into her eyes. \u201cFine! I\u2026I-I\u2026fucking damn it,\u201d it wasn\u2019t like handling himself online, where he was in control and say he and Phil were just friends until he was blue in the face. But being put on the spot made him shut down, he could hardly see straight, let alone tell a convincing lie. \u201cThere, whatever. I can\u2019t do it. Happy?\u201d</p><p>There was another pause before Cat replied. \u201cWell, no\u2026I feel bad that you feel like you have to hide, that being honest with a friend had to be dragged out of you. Maybe I should have had a separate conversation from the sexual attraction thing\u2026\u201d she looked down, guilt written on her face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more than willing to pretend this never happened,\u201d Dan offered, expression softening, only to tense back up when a male voice cleared its throat.</p><p>\u201cFood\u2019s here,\u201d Phil said, holding up the bag with one hand and waving awkwardly with the other.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get back?\u201d Dan asked, going back to looking exclusively at the floor. He had memorized the carpet pattern by now.</p><p>Phil walked towards the desk to set the food down, taking that moment to not have to look at either of them. \u201cIn the middle of Cat\u2019s ultimatum.\u201d</p><p>Dan groaned, flopping backwards on to the bed. \u201cI wanna go home,\u201d he whined.</p><p>Sometime down the line he would properly apologize to Cat, but in the meantime, he knew he had to get through the rest of their stay with the hopes he didn\u2019t cause irrevocable damage to his friendship with her.</p></p>",

But that\u2019s only the tip of the iceberg - with an unsteady future, undiagnosed mental illness, and suddenly thrust into the public eye, 2012 was a tumultuous year, one that no one has yet to truly understand.</p><p><b>Chapter: </b>3 - <i>March</i></p><p><b>Word Count: </b>2.3k</p><p><b>Relationship: </b>Dan Howell/Phil Lester</p><p><b>Rating: </b>E</p><p><b>Chapter Warnings: </b>n/a</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15992774/chapters/37754768\">Read on AO3</a> | <a href=\"http://memelordhowell.tumblr.com/post/178092110971/title-a-year-in-the-life\">January </a>| <a href=\"http://memelordhowell.tumblr.com/post/178322225541/a-year-in-the-life-212\">February</a></i></p></blockquote><p><b>3/2/12 \u2013 2:41 PM</b></p><p>\u201cIt just feels off, you know?\u201d Phil was saying as they walked into Starbucks. \u201cI feel like Dan and I have centered so much of the past few years around each other and now it\u2019s all out of whack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it, I do,\u201d Martyn assured as they stepped up to place their order. \u201cBut I think a break might be good for you. You tend to fall hard and fast for people, maybe some space will help you pace yourself. Worst case scenario, there are plenty of fish in the sea.\u201d</p><p>Phil listened, but he couldn\u2019t help but notice the way the barista seemed to be listening to their conversation, even as she filled their orders. He wasn\u2019t bothered by it per se \u2013 though it was rude to eavesdrop \u2013 but he couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she would care. He took his drink when she handed it to him, but it wasn\u2019t until he and his brother had sat down that he noticed she had written her number on the cup. \u201cOh. That\u2019s new,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Martyn leaned over to look at the cup, then glanced over towards the barista. \u201cShe\u2019s cute. You should text her.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cBut what if I do, and we date, and break up? I wouldn\u2019t be able to come back here again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo just go to a different Starbucks,\u201d Martyn shrugged.</p><p>Phil shook his head, \u201cI <i>can\u2019t</i>. This one\u2019s special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of Dan,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cWhich is what led us to this point in the first place. See? Full circle. Text her,\u201d there was a pause as he sensed his younger brother\u2019s hesitation. \u201cListen, I like Dan. I think he\u2019s a great guy. But I don\u2019t want you to get hung up on something that\u2019s still up in the air.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Phil set his cup back down and took a picture of her number. Just in case.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cAm I a bad person?\u201d Dan asked. While Phil was out with Martyn, he decided today would be best spent with a friend, especially one that knew both of them and was familiar with their situation.</p><p>\u201cBad people don\u2019t ask if they\u2019re bad,\u201d PJ replied, handing him a drink and sitting beside him with his own. \u201cWhat makes you think you are?\u201d</p><p>Dan took a swig of his drink, sighing heavily. \u201cI can see myself hurting Phil while I\u2019m doing it, and I keep telling myself that it\u2019s going to work out, that it\u2019s what we need. But each time I want to stop and just be with him. I\u2019m just\u2026\u201d he gestured vaguely, trying to find the right words. \u201cI\u2019m scared, I guess,\u201d he cringed at the confession, embarrassed that it was the case.</p><p>PJ furrowed his brows, shifting to face Dan instead of just sitting beside him. \u201cWhat are you scared of?\u201d</p><p>Silence filled the room as Dan searched for words. He wanted to explain how he felt, but at the same time, that put it into the world, it made everything real. \u201cI\u2019m scared of falling even more in love with him than I was before, and it\u2019ll hurt that much more when he realizes I\u2019m not worth the effort and kicks me to the curb. At this point it\u2019s what I deserve, though,\u201d he tilted his head back and blinked rapidly. He didn\u2019t want to cry, that was saved for him to do alone in his room in the middle of the night.</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t talk about yourself like that,\u201d PJ wrapped a comforting arm around him, pulling him closer. \u201cYou are worth effort and love and all of that. I know it\u2019s not as simple as saying \u2018go be with him because that\u2019s where your heart is\u2019 but you need to stop sabotaging yourself. Making him mad at you won\u2019t make you feel any better.\u201d</p><p>Dan sniffled, leaning into PJ\u2019s embrace while pointedly avoiding looking in his direction. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p><b>3/16/12 \u2013 1:07 PM</b></p><p>Dan glanced around when they entered the Starbucks. They were filming \u2018A Day in the Life\u2019 so of course they had to stop by their coffee shop and get their usual orders. It wouldn\u2019t be true to life without it. His stomach was in a knot and he kept fumbling with the sleeves of his jumper.</p><p>Phil kept the camera off him for that moment, until he decided to pause it long enough to ask, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>Dan glared at him and huffed. \u201cYou know who. <i>Charlotte</i>,\u201d the name was bitter on his tongue, and his face scrunched up as if it\u2019d created a foul odor as well. He then realized his subconscious reaction and quickly covered it up with, \u201cI just think it would be awkward if she were here while we\u2019re filming. If you start proper dating, it\u2019ll be even weirder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell she\u2019s not here, so you can unclench,\u201d Phil rolled his eyes. He waited for him to relax before turning the camera on and filming resumed. Overall, their outing went well, and it was nice to spend time together as friends, without the pressure of worrying about how their relationship would come off to their audience, or even the strangers they passed on the Manchester streets. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you like her, anyway? I figured you\u2019d be happy that I\u2019m trying to branch out.\u201d</p><p>Dan shook his head and looked down. \u201cI don\u2019t <i>not</i> like her. I just don\u2019t know anything about her, except that she makes a decent caramel macchiato. She could be a serial killer that\u2019s just good at hiding it for all we know.\u201d</p><p>Phil rolled his eyes fondly and laughed. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s something horribly unusual about her that\u2019ll make for a great video when we break up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit. By the way,\u201d he said as they were leaving, \u201cIf you do go beyond the \u2018texting and coffee dates\u2019 with her, and you guys break up, you\u2019re going to have to deal with it.

Duly noted,\u201d Cat had a wide grin on her lips, one that caused Phil to shoot Dan a subtle, but knowing look.</p><p><b>3/29/12 \u2013 5:51 PM</b></p><p>\u201cYou guys getting hungry?\u201d Phil asked. They had spent the whole afternoon filming and working on the video and were just about ready to call it a day. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go hitch a quick ride into town to get some food,\u201d he told them as he got up. He took their lunch orders and again, gave Dan another knowing look before leaving.</p><p>Dan had got up from the filming spot as well, shifting up to sit on the edge of the bed, phone in hand, figuring he would check his email as he planned on how to address what he and Phil had discussed. He glanced over at Cat, who looked quite pleased to be alone with him.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d without waiting for a response, she continued. \u201cWhat are you and Phil? You can tell me, seriously.\u201d</p><p>Of all the things he had expected her to ask, his relationship with Phil hadn\u2019t even made it on to the radar. Dan was blindsided and wasn\u2019t sure how to respond. He considered, for a moment, telling her the truth \u2013 that he and Phil had been dating for nearly three years, but stepped away from the \u2018boyfriend\u2019 label to help ease the pressure they were facing from the outside world. In a split-second decision, however, he changed his mind. Even if Cat was their friend, he wasn\u2019t close enough to her to fully trust her with that knowledge. \u201cWe\u2019re friends, silly. Really good friends, but that\u2019s it, I promise,\u201d he forced out a laugh, hoping it would be enough to convince her.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s all there is to it? Because I\u2019ve been making it pretty clear that I\u2019m, you know, \u2018DTF\u2019, and you never notice because you\u2019re looking at Phil, or laughing at a joke he made. And I mean listen, I\u2019m not claiming to be some sort of irresistible Aphrodite, but I feel like most single, straight guys would acknowledge it,\u201d her tone was a mix of accusatory and offended, both of which rubbed Dan the wrong way.</p><p>Dan got up, crossing his arms. His brows knitted together, and his gaze was on the floor. \u201cSo, just because I\u2019m not interested in fucking you, I\u2019m gay for my best friend?\u201d he lifted his gaze to glare at her, his words as heated as his face was getting.</p><p>Cat recoiled at his harshness, standing up and taking a half-step back. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that! I\u2019m saying you live with the guy and still want to spend all your time with him, to the point you didn\u2019t even <i>notice</i> I wanted to fuck you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my <i>friend</i>, of course I like being around him! I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t smart enough to pick up on your apparently obvious hints, but that doesn\u2019t mean shit,\u201d this wasn\u2019t the way it was supposed to go down. He was only planning on finding out if Cat fancied him or not, not get into an argument with her about it.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you getting so defensive?\u201d she snapped, her jaw clenched.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re accusing me of a hell of a lot since you got your feelings hurt,\u201d in some part of his brain, he knew that she was a victim in this \u2013 her actions didn\u2019t warrant this anger from him. But he had gotten on this train and it felt impossible to get off. \u201cWhat Phil and I do is none of your fucking business.\u201d</p><p>Cat quirked her brow at that. \u201cOh, so you are doing something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I mean, it doesn\u2019t matter if we were, it\u2019s not your place to ask,\u201d he huffed.</p><p>\u201cLook, my feelings aside, I\u2019m still your friend, and his. Friends don\u2019t keep secrets from each other just to look good. Look me in the eyes and tell me you don\u2019t have any feelings for him, and I\u2019ll drop it.\u201d</p><p>Dan felt backed into the corner, fidgeting in agitation and struggling to look into her eyes. \u201cFine! I\u2026I-I\u2026fucking damn it,\u201d it wasn\u2019t like handling himself online, where he was in control and say he and Phil were just friends until he was blue in the face. But being put on the spot made him shut down, he could hardly see straight, let alone tell a convincing lie. \u201cThere, whatever. I can\u2019t do it. Happy?\u201d</p><p>There was another pause before Cat replied. \u201cWell, no\u2026I feel bad that you feel like you have to hide, that being honest with a friend had to be dragged out of you. Maybe I should have had a separate conversation from the sexual attraction thing\u2026\u201d she looked down, guilt written on her face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more than willing to pretend this never happened,\u201d Dan offered, expression softening, only to tense back up when a male voice cleared its throat.</p><p>\u201cFood\u2019s here,\u201d Phil said, holding up the bag with one hand and waving awkwardly with the other.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get back?\u201d Dan asked, going back to looking exclusively at the floor. He had memorized the carpet pattern by now.</p><p>Phil walked towards the desk to set the food down, taking that moment to not have to look at either of them. \u201cIn the middle of Cat\u2019s ultimatum.\u201d</p><p>Dan groaned, flopping backwards on to the bed. \u201cI wanna go home,\u201d he whined.</p><p>Sometime down the line he would properly apologize to Cat, but in the meantime, he knew he had to get through the rest of their stay with the hopes he didn\u2019t cause irrevocable damage to his friendship with her.</p></p>",

You tend to fall hard and fast for people, maybe some space will help you pace yourself. Worst case scenario, there are plenty of fish in the sea.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil listened, but he couldn&rsquo;t help but notice the way the barista seemed to be listening to their conversation, even as she filled their orders. He wasn&rsquo;t bothered by it per se &ndash; though it was rude to eavesdrop &ndash; but he couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder why she would care. He took his drink when she handed it to him, but it wasn&rsquo;t until he and his brother had sat down that he noticed she had written her number on the cup. &ldquo;Oh. That&rsquo;s new,&rdquo; he murmured.</p><p>Martyn leaned over to look at the cup, then glanced over towards the barista. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s cute. You should text her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But what if I do, and we date, and break up? I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to come back here again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So just go to a different Starbucks,&rdquo; Martyn shrugged.</p><p>Phil shook his head, &ldquo;I <i>can&rsquo;t</i>. This one&rsquo;s special.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because of Dan,&rdquo; he pointed out. &ldquo;Which is what led us to this point in the first place. See? Full circle. Text her,&rdquo; there was a pause as he sensed his younger brother&rsquo;s hesitation. &ldquo;Listen, I like Dan. I think he&rsquo;s a great guy. But I don&rsquo;t want you to get hung up on something that&rsquo;s still up in the air.&rdquo;</p><p>Nodding, Phil set his cup back down and took a picture of her number. Just in case.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Am I a bad person?&rdquo; Dan asked. While Phil was out with Martyn, he decided today would be best spent with a friend, especially one that knew both of them and was familiar with their situation.</p><p>&ldquo;Bad people don&rsquo;t ask if they&rsquo;re bad,&rdquo; PJ replied, handing him a drink and sitting beside him with his own. &ldquo;What makes you think you are?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan took a swig of his drink, sighing heavily. &ldquo;I can see myself hurting Phil while I&rsquo;m doing it, and I keep telling myself that it&rsquo;s going to work out, that it&rsquo;s what we need. But each time I want to stop and just be with him. I&rsquo;m just&hellip;&rdquo; he gestured vaguely, trying to find the right words. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared, I guess,&rdquo; he cringed at the confession, embarrassed that it was the case.</p><p>PJ furrowed his brows, shifting to face Dan instead of just sitting beside him. &ldquo;What are you scared of?&rdquo;</p><p>Silence filled the room as Dan searched for words. He wanted to explain how he felt, but at the same time, that put it into the world, it made everything real. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared of falling even more in love with him than I was before, and it&rsquo;ll hurt that much more when he realizes I&rsquo;m not worth the effort and kicks me to the curb. At this point it&rsquo;s what I deserve, though,&rdquo; he tilted his head back and blinked rapidly. He didn&rsquo;t want to cry, that was saved for him to do alone in his room in the middle of the night.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t talk about yourself like that,&rdquo; PJ wrapped a comforting arm around him, pulling him closer. &ldquo;You are worth effort and love and all of that. I know it&rsquo;s not as simple as saying &lsquo;go be with him because that&rsquo;s where your heart is&rsquo; but you need to stop sabotaging yourself. Making him mad at you won&rsquo;t make you feel any better.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan sniffled, leaning into PJ&rsquo;s embrace while pointedly avoiding looking in his direction. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to lose him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p><b>3/16/12 &ndash; 1:07 PM</b></p><p>Dan glanced around when they entered the Starbucks. They were filming &lsquo;A Day in the Life&rsquo; so of course they had to stop by their coffee shop and get their usual orders. It wouldn&rsquo;t be true to life without it. His stomach was in a knot and he kept fumbling with the sleeves of his jumper.</p><p>Phil kept the camera off him for that moment, until he decided to pause it long enough to ask, &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is she here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan glared at him and huffed. &ldquo;You know who. <i>Charlotte</i>,&rdquo; the name was bitter on his tongue, and his face scrunched up as if it&rsquo;d created a foul odor as well. He then realized his subconscious reaction and quickly covered it up with, &ldquo;I just think it would be awkward if she were here while we&rsquo;re filming. If you start proper dating, it&rsquo;ll be even weirder.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well she&rsquo;s not here, so you can unclench,&rdquo; Phil rolled his eyes. He waited for him to relax before turning the camera on and filming resumed. Overall, their outing went well, and it was nice to spend time together as friends, without the pressure of worrying about how their relationship would come off to their audience, or even the strangers they passed on the Manchester streets. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you like her, anyway? I figured you&rsquo;d be happy that I&rsquo;m trying to branch out.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan shook his head and looked down. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t <i>not</i> like her. I just don&rsquo;t know anything about her, except that she makes a decent caramel macchiato. She could be a serial killer that&rsquo;s just good at hiding it for all we know.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil rolled his eyes fondly and laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s something horribly unusual about her that&rsquo;ll make for a great video when we break up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the spirit. By the way,&rdquo; he said as they were leaving, &ldquo;If you do go beyond the &lsquo;texting and coffee dates&rsquo; with her, and you guys break up, you&rsquo;re going to have to deal with it. We&rsquo;re not finding another Starbucks &ndash; that one&rsquo;s ours.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil looked over at Dan and smiled, bumping against his shoulder with his own. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way.&rdquo;</p><p><b>3/28/12 &ndash; 6:23 PM</b></p><p>&ldquo;So, are you ignoring it, or do you just not care?&rdquo; Phil asked as he washed his hands.</p><p>Dan leaned against another sink in the mini golf men&rsquo;s room, folding his arms over his chest. &ldquo;What are you on about? You being a sore loser?&rdquo; he smirked.</p><p>&ldquo;First off, no I&rsquo;m not. Second, Cat was making eyes at you the whole time. She even did the thing where she asked you to &lsquo;adjust her position&rsquo; so you&rsquo;d put your arms around her,&rdquo; Phil was amused by how oblivious Dan was to the girl&rsquo;s flirtation, even if watching people try to get with him made his chest tighten.</p><p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s just how she is, Phil,&rdquo; Dan chuckled. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s&hellip;bubbly and outgoing. It&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re used to,&rdquo; he did suspect that Cat had a crush on him, and he didn&rsquo;t mind it. But he felt like engaging in anything with another youtuber was hypocritical considering everything he had put Phil through for similar reasons. If he ignored the issue, it would go away, right?</p><p>Phil tilted his head in thought, then a small smirk tugged at his lips. &ldquo;How about we figure it out for sure? She&rsquo;s never been alone with you before. Tomorrow, when we film, I&rsquo;ll go out to get food and you see what happens.&rdquo;</p><p>They headed out of the bathroom, Dan shoving his hands in his pockets. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re on,&rdquo; he told him before they rejoined the girl and left the mini golf course, deciding to go out for dinner before returning to their respective hotel rooms and heading to a local diner.</p><p>&ldquo;You guys have gotten crazy popular lately, has that made it harder to date?&rdquo; Cat asked them with what appeared to be sincere curiosity. She was sat next to Dan, who was sitting across from Phil, as she took the seat next to him before the other had a chance.</p><p>Neither of them answered at first, waiting for the other to take the lead. Phil finally did so by saying &ldquo;Well, you know, it can be complicated. We want to maintain a certain image for the fans and getting into a new, serious relationship could throw a wrench in things,&rdquo; he was admittedly proud of his diplomatic response, and looking over at Dan, it appeared that he deemed it acceptable as well.</p><p>&ldquo;So, no serious relationships?

He\u2019s just tired, and he already took a shower\nthis morning.</p><p>Ahead,\nthey have hubbub of PINOF, Spooky Week, and Gamingmas\u2014the seasons which require\na lot work within the Dan and Phil household, but there is nothing overarching or\nwith a grand motive. Nothing big, nothing long-term.\u00a0</p><p>Well,\nthere are still the unannounced tour dates, and that is still stressing him\nout, despite not wanting to admit it. They even have the documentary that they\nwill start and finish this week. Still, they\u2019ve pretty much worked through\neverything regarding the tour, yet <i>what\u2019s next</i>?</p><p>Phil\nknows that he really does not need to be doing all this thinking right now.\nThey\u2019ve only been back a day now. They deserve to relax: catch up on T.V.\nshows, fill up on Dominos, have\u2014</p><p>\u201cHey\nPhil, do you want to go on a walk with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh,\nsure!\u201d Phil glances up from where he is staring at the blank wall from his spot\non the couch. Dan is looking at him, standing above him. Maybe having a nice\nday with Dan will cheer up his mood? It usually does.\u00a0</p><p>But,\nhe feels stuck.\u00a0</p><p>Phil\nlooks out the window for an answer, \u201cDan, it\u2019s drizzling. Maybe we shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Dan\nraises an eyebrow, and Phil rolls his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\nI already changed it yesterday when I went to the shops.\u201d It\u2019s a lame excuse,\nbut he doesn\u2019t think Dan catches it.</p><p>Dan\nlaughs, \u201cOh, like you\u2019re so moral all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\nI\u2019ll do it just because I love you or whatever.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan\nsnorts.</p><p>Phil\ncan hold himself together, and he smiles because he loves Dan.\u00a0</p><p>Phil\nhauls himself off the couch to find his jacket and put on some shoes. He grabs\nhis wallet and his charging cellphone that is plugged into the wall.</p><p>He\nfollows behind Dan, as they head down the stairs.\u00a0</p><p>Then,\nthey are outside, and the rain stops. That is something reliable.</p><p>\u201cDo\nyou want to go to the bakery?\u201d Dan asks, \u201cI\u2019m craving sugar, and I know that you\nare too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan\nbumps Phil\u2019s shoulder and wiggles his eyebrows.</p><p>Phil\nshoves his hands into his pockets, \u201cThis is what those pistachio muffins do to\nyou, huh?\u201d</p><p>They\nkeep walking.\u00a0</p><p>Phil\nwas kind of okay, but now he isn\u2019t. He hates that. As all the people busily\nwalk by, his chest feels tight and everything feels shallow. He tries to keep\nup his pace and mask the sound of his breathing. London doesn\u2019t care, even\nthough it owes him.\u00a0</p><p>It\nstarts drizzling because he isn\u2019t concentrating, and the surrounding world\ndoesn\u2019t exist, despite it being all he can think about. The people around him\nwho press forward are starting to break out their umbrellas.\u00a0</p><p>Dan\nturns to look at him. Dan notices the rain. His curls are flattened.</p><p>Their\neyes lock, and Phil hates how obvious he is\u2014how shit he is at holding things\nin.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\nalright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\nI\u2019m good\u2014just don\u2019t feel the greatest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo\nyou want to go back?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil\nshakes his head. \u201cWe\u2019re almost there anyways.\u201d He can do this.\u00a0</p><p>Dan\u2019s\nknuckles brush the side of Phil\u2019s thigh, as Dan walks beside him. It\u2019s brief,\nbut it\u2019s there.
