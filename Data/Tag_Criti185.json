As you said, this is\nmuch better for business.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cGlad we could be of help, ma\u2019am,\u201d\nFjord says.</p><p>\u201cPlease, let me give you some gold\nas a token of my gratitude.\u201d</p><p>Fjord puts up his hands. \u201cYou don\u2019t\nhave to do that. You\u2019ve already helped us by giving us a place to stay.\u201d</p><p>Marion turns to Jester. \u201cWhat if I\ngave <i>you</i> some gold and you can share\nit with your friends? Say, seven hundred?\u201d</p><p>Jester\u2019s eyes go wide. \u201cMama! You\ndon\u2019t have to give us that much!\u201d</p><p>Her mother shrugs. \u201cConsider it\nyour allowance for the next few months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026okay, if it\u2019s my allowance\u2026\u201d It\ndidn\u2019t take much to twist Jester\u2019s arm. The gleam in her eyes betrays how\ndelighted she is by the offer. She might even actually share some of that with\nthe rest of the group.</p><!-- more --><p>Molly reconsiders that judgement.\nJester has been more of a team player since the Nest. Perhaps it\u2019s out of\nsolidarity to, not only those who saved her, but to Fjord and Yasha, who went\nthrough it all with her. Or maybe it\u2019s because with Caduceus on their team she\nis free to play around with her spells during combat more. She does seem to\nappreciate having the firbolg as an ally.</p><p>Then there are the other\nopportunities he brings. On their way up to Marion\u2019s rooms, Jester had walked\nbeside Molly with a big grin and whispered, \u201cI didn\u2019t get to say anything\nearlier but <i>oh my gosh you totally made\nout with Caduceus!</i>\u201d</p><p>Molly had grinned back. \u201cSo I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was it like?\u201d</p><p>Caduceus was walking ahead of them\nat the time. One of his ears was angled slightly back in their direction.\nKeeping his voice low, but not too low, Molly replied, \u201cMaybe you should try it\nyourself and find out.\u201d</p><p>Jester squealed and pranced\nexcitedly up a few steps. \u201cIt was really good, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Molly shrugged. \u201cA tiefling never\nkisses and tells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d tell you if someone was a good\nkisser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably because you\u2019re only\n<i>half</i>-tiefling, dear.\u201d Molly had\nsmirked as Jester wrinkled her nose in a grumpy pout.</p><p>That little jab hit her harder than\nMolly thought, or it had tipped a decision she was already making, because once\nJester has graciously accepted her mother\u2019s offer, she says, \u201cMama, I want to\ntry sending a message to the Gentleman again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Marion\u2019s expression is hard\nto read, but she continues petting Sprinkles.</p><p>\u201cLike, yesterday I kinda threw a\nlot at him at once. And I think Zadash is far enough east that maybe it was\nlater in the day and I woke him up or something. Can we try to contact him\ntomorrow morning?\u201d</p><p>Marion thinks a moment, face still\ncarefully guarded. \u201cIf that is what you want, then I would be interested to\nhear his reply.\u201d</p><p>Jester gives her mother a hug.\nMarion pats her tenderly on the head. \u201cIf he is my dad, I just want to know why\nhe didn\u2019t come back,\u201d Jester says. \u201cWhen I first left home I thought maybe I\u2019d\ngo live with my dad, but I like being with these guys. Someday maybe I can earn\nenough gold to buy my own house and he can come stay with me.\u201d</p><p>Marion giggles softly. \u201cThat sounds\nlovely.\u201d She sighs. \u201cAnd I must admit, I am\u2026also curious about some things. We\ncan discuss it tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Beau nods. \u201cFor now, we gotta worry\nabout this\u2026LePool? LaPwahl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty sure it\u2019s pronounced \u2018LePual\u2019,\u201d\nFjord says. \u201cAnd we can talk about that over dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me buy that for you, at least,\u201d\nMarion says. \u201cGo downstairs and tell them that whatever you want, it\u2019s on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy thank you,\u201d Molly says with a\ncourteous bow. \u201cYou do serve some excellent cheeses here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe finest,\u201d Marion says. Her\nsmile is so much brighter with this irritation off her conscience. Molly wishes\nhe had enough money to buy an evening with her so he could spend it making her\nlaugh.</p><p>As the group heads downstairs,\nCaduceus stops Molly at the top of the landing. Molly had concerns that Caduceus\nwould be upset by his little stunt earlier, and braces himself for the worst.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you know why I want to\ntalk to you,\u201d Caduceus says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m think I do, yeah.\u201d Molly\nsmiles apologetically. \u201cI was just having some fun, that\u2019s all. Wanted to put\non a show for Fjord.\u201d</p><p>Caduceus nods. He doesn\u2019t look\nangry, nor does he look like he completely buys that excuse. \u201cI don\u2019t think\nFjord found it as amusing as you did. I was fine with it, though, for the\nrecord. Haven\u2019t been kissed like that in a while and, well, frankly it was more\nenjoyable than the last time.\u201d Before Molly has a chance to mentally digest\nthat nugget of information, Caduceus continues, \u201cHowever, there are, uh,\ncertain other members of our party who didn\u2019t find it so funny either. I won\u2019t\nname names because I don\u2019t know if they even know how much it bothered them,\nbut it\u2019s something to keep in mind, yeah?\u201d</p><p>Molly stares up at Caduceus for a\nmoment, processing. There\u2019s something in the firbolg\u2019s eyes that makes the hair\non the back of Molly\u2019s neck prickle. Caduceus is an impressive sight on his\nown, but those eyes\u2026</p><p>\u201cAnd by the way,\u201d Caduceus adds, \u201cI\nlike you too, just not that way.\u201d He reaches down with one broad hand to tousle\nthe hair between Molly\u2019s horns, then lightly chucks Molly under the chin before\nstriding away down the stairs.</p><p>Molly traces the spot on his chin\nwhere Caduceus touched him. \u201cFuck, that was kinda hot.\u201d If Caduceus hadn\u2019t preemptively\nshot down his advances, Molly would have turned up the charm so hard that night\njust to see where he could take things. Mr. Clay was one step ahead though, as\nhe often seemed to be. Molly takes a deep breath then hurries to catch up with\nthe rest.</p><p>Dinner is delicious and decadent, the\nway Molly likes it. He keeps an eye on Caduceus, who doesn\u2019t regard him more\nthan he does anyone else at the table. Fjord is doing most of the talking. He\u2019s\ngoing over what they should tell this guy when they get there, how they can\nconvince him to tell them what they know, what to do if he gets aggressive.</p><p>\u201cWe are going there to <i>talk</i>, okay?\u201d Fjord says. \u201cI\u2019d almost say\nwe should leave our weapons here, but we all remember what happened when we\ntried \u2018just talking\u2019 to that Crick feller.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I remember that,\u201d\nCaduceus says with genuine confusion. \u201cWhen was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd also isn\u2019t \u2018Crick\u2019 a slur?\u201d\nJester asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay, maybe, I dunno. Um, Caduceus,\nthere was this, uh, spy\u2026guy we fought in the sewers once because he wasn\u2019t as\nkeen on talking as we were.\u201d</p><p>Caduceus nods. \u201cAh, I see. Well, I\ncan calm him down if he gets spooked or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. That\u2019s good. We want\ninformation, and we can\u2019t get that if he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmmm, actually we can,\u201d Jester\npoints out. \u201cBoth Caduceus and I can Speak with Dead.\u201d</p><p>Fjord rubs his palm against his\ntemple. \u201cOkay, but let\u2019s not go there with the <i>intent </i>of killing anyone, alright?\u201d</p><p>Everyone agrees with that. There\u2019s\nstill time before midnight, so everyone sort of drifts their separate ways\nafter dinner. Molly heads up to the room he\u2019s sharing with Fjord and Caduceus\nto polish and sharpen his swords. He didn\u2019t have time that morning and he wants\nthem ready if it comes to a fight. He doesn\u2019t want it to. If he could charm his\nway through every situation like he used to in the carnival he would. However,\nout here, in this new life as an adventurer\u2026mercenary\u2026errand-boy-who-specializes-in-danger\u2026whatever\nthey are, most things end on the edge of a blade than on a good word.</p><p>Summer\u2019s Dance is a true beauty.\nMolly cherishes it as one of the finest things he owns, if not THE finest. The\ntapestry is nice, but the tapestry isn\u2019t magical, as far as he knows. The\nPeriapt is the most expensive thing he has ever bought, but it didn\u2019t save him\nin the end, now did it? Besides, if Summer\u2019s Dance <i>is </i>made of real gold, and those <i>are\n</i>real jewels, then it must be worth at least ten times what he paid for the\nnecklace, maybe even a hundred times more. Thinking back to where they found\nit, the case was trapped, so whoever put it in there knew it was valuable.\nDoesn\u2019t matter how much it would cost, though, since he has absolutely no\nintention of selling it any time in the future.</p><p>Molly takes more care in sharpening\nSummer\u2019s Dance than he does with his old swords. Those are flashy, but\nultimately replaceable if he could find the right materials. With Summer\u2019s\nDance he carefully draws the whetstone over the blade, almost lovingly. He hasn\u2019t\nhired any \u201ccompanions\u201d since his resurrection. Everyone expected him to run to\nthe first whore house he passed, and he had thought about it, but he found more\npleasure in getting absolutely shit-faced with the group. He was getting better\nat reducing their hangovers, and the damage he took from that healed faster\nevery time. </p><p>Speaking of which, he tested Summer\u2019s\nDance on himself. A quick slash against the back of his neck, so light he\nbarely felt it and yet the golden sheen was streaked with blood when he withdrew\nit. At his will, the blood let off sparks, crackling with blue energy. That was\nnew. The night after they had raided the Sour Nest, a night where everyone\nagreed they felt more powerful in their victory, Molly had wondered what more\nhe could possibly do. There was that tug in his mind, like an intrusive thought\ntelling him to break a fragile glass or throw himself off a high place, but as\nalways these thoughts told him to attempt feats of magic. Soon after joining\nthe Mighty Nein it told him to try making his blood radiate light, and so it\nhad. Sleeping in the emptied Nest, he contemplated what else his blood could do.\nHe thought of Yasha, passed out beside him, and her connection to the Storm\nLord. Maybe she would like it if he could wield lightning, too.</p><p>Someone knocks on the door. \u201cMolly?\nYou decent?\u201d It\u2019s Fjord.</p><p>Molly wipes off Summer\u2019s Dance. The\nlingering energy makes his fingers tingle. \u201cAs decent as ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026Are you at least wearing pants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come in and see for\nyourself?\u201d Molly asks, arranging himself in a facetiously seductive pose.</p><p>Fjord\u2019s growl is barely audible\nthrough the door. \u201cMolly, come on, I just want to lie down for a little while.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Fine</i>. I swear by the orb in your chest that I am clothed.\u201d</p><p>The door opens. Fjord peeks in\nfirst, then fully enters. \u201cThank you.\u201d He glances at the set up Molly has on\nthe floor. \u201cPraying over your swords?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPolishing them, for now. Prayers\ncome later.\u201d Molly\u2019s prayer has changed recently. It used to be \u201cWhatever I\u2019m\ndoing, let me do it well.\u201d Now it\u2019s \u201cWhatever you let me come back for, let me\novercome it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t really done anything\nwith my sword,\u201d Fjord says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it even <i>needs </i>polishing.\u201d</p><p>Molly shrugs. \u201cIt might like it if\nyou did once in a while.\u201d He keeps his tone subtle, but he watches to see if\nFjord caught the double entendre.</p><p>As always, Fjord is oblivious as\nfuck. \u201cWould it? D\u2019you\u2026 D\u2019you think it <i>thinks</i>?\u201d\nFjord furrows his brow in concern. He holds out his hand and with a splash of\nseawater he summons his falchion. A few drops get on Summer\u2019s Dance, so Molly quickly\nwipes them off with his rag. \u201cSorry,\u201d Fjord mumbles. He\u2019s examining the\nfalchion. That damn eye in the hilt is creepy. It looks like one of Fjord\u2019s\neyes, though, just more unsettling because it\u2019s staring out from a place where\nit wasn\u2019t before. Fjord checks that, too. He turns the blade over in his hands,\nwatching it as it watches\u2026whatever it\u2019s looking at.</p><p>Molly pats the ground beside him. \u201cC\u2019mon,\nyou can borrow my whetstone.\u201d He shakes his finger at the falchion. \u201cIf that\nthing infects it with some kind of curse or makes my swords smell like salt\nwater, you\u2019re buying me a new one.\u201d</p><p>Fjord chuckles. \u201cYeah, alright.\nThanks.\u201d He sits besides Molly and takes the whetstone from his hand. He\u2019s\ndelicate about it, barely letting their skin touch. Molly thinks about what\nCaduceus said. Could Fjord be\u2026? No. As funny as that would be, and as much as\nMolly would like it, no.</p><p>\u201cNervous about tonight?\u201d Molly\nasks.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Fjord runs the whetstone\nalong the edge of his falchion. His eyes are glazed in concentration.</p><p>Seeing their swords side-by-side,\nMolly notices that a falchion is essentially a scimitar without the curves. He\nlikes his swords better. He picks up Summer\u2019s Dance and continues polishing it.\nThe jewels shine back at him. If swords <i>do\n</i>think, then Summer\u2019s Dance must be happy that Molly keeps it looking so\nbeautiful. Fjord\u2019s sword reminds Molly of him; it\u2019s not what one would call\nmajestic, and clearly it has been somewhere that left its mark, but it\u2019s still\nquite the sword. It does seem like it doesn\u2019t need anyone to maintain it, but\nFjord needs something to occupy him for now and this at least <i>feels </i>productive even if it\u2019s pointless.</p><p>\u201cSo if your sword looks different\nbecause you ate someone else\u2019s sword,\u201d Molly says, \u201cdoes that mean it\u2019ll keep\ngetting bigger and meaner the more swords you eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. And I don\u2019t really\nwant to explore that.\u201d Fjord tests the tip of the blade with his thumb. He\ntilts his head then leans in close to focus on it with the whetstone.</p><p>\u201cDoes everything you swallow go\ninto the sword?\u201d</p><p>Fjord frowns. \u201cNo. And I don\u2019t want\nto explore that either. Besides, I don\u2019t\u2026it\u2019s not that I <i>eat </i>the swords or whatever, they just get\u2026y\u2019know\u2026consumed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill goes into you first.\u201d Molly\ndigs a fleck of something out of the setting around what might be an emerald. \u201cBut,\nas someone who has had a blade in his chest, I can see why you wouldn\u2019t want to\nstick any more in there.\u201d</p><p>Whatever frustration or focus\netched the lines in Fjord\u2019s face, it quickly melts to melancholy and guilt. \u201cMolly,\nI\u2019m so sorry that happened to you. You didn\u2019t have to. The rest of you should\nhave left us behind.\u201d</p><p>Molly rolls his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re not\nhaving this discussion again. Of <i>course </i>we\nwere always going to come after you. Doesn\u2019t matter if Tiamat herself took you,\nyou\u2019re our friends. <i>You </i>are <i>my </i>friend. If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve\nlearned in my short time it\u2019s that you don\u2019t abandon someone when they\u2019re in\ntrouble, especially an ally.\u201d</p><p>Fjord half-smiles. He hasn\u2019t looked\nat Molly this whole time. \u201cThank you. I hope one day I can deserve that sort of\nfriendship.\u201d</p><p>Molly playfully slaps Fjord with\nhis tail. \u201cLike I said, we\u2019re not talking about that.\u201d He rests his elbow\nagainst his knee and props his chin against his fist. \u201cDo you need a hug?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d It\u2019s too quick of a response.\nDespite the finality in his tone, Fjord darts his eyes towards Molly long\nenough to give reasonable doubt.</p><p>Molly grins. \u201cDo you <i>want </i>a hug?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014 Thank you, but\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026But what?\u201d</p><p>Fjord grits his teeth. \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018What for?\u2019 For\ngods\u2019 sakes, it\u2019s a hug. You hug the people you like when they need a reminder\nthat someone cares about them. Or because one or both of you wants it. So, do\nyou want \u2014 and/or need \u2014 a hug?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promise it\u2014\u201d Fjord clears his\nthroat. \u201cIt\u2019s just a hug, right? Not like\u2026like\u2026\u201d He mimes something that\nreminds Molly of his moment with Caduceus. He\u2019s trying so hard not to blush and\nfailing so spectacularly that Molly can\u2019t help but laugh.</p><p>\u201cNo surprises, I promise. I wasn\u2019t\nlying about having pants on, was I?\u201d Molly gets to his feet and holds out his\narms. \u201cGet over here, sailor.\u201d</p><p>With some hesitation, Fjord sets\ndown the falchion so he can push himself up. He takes a few awkward steps in\nMolly\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cUgh, I swear you can be worse than\nBeau and Caleb combined.\u201d Molly beckons with his hands still outstretched. \u201cIt\u2019ll\nbe over soon and you\u2019ll feel better afterwards. C\u2019mon.\u201d</p><p>Fjord finally walks into the hug\nwith his arms slumped forward to sort of hold Molly by his sides. Molly puts\none arm around Fjord\u2019s waist and uses the other to pat Fjord on the back.\nThough he doesn\u2019t want to be too sappy, Molly also tries to convey through the\npressure and positioning of his hug that he does genuinely care. He cares that\nFjord is on edge now that he\u2019s close to learning more about his powers. He\ncares that Fjord has been more distant and quiet since the Nest. He cares about\nFjord in general, the way he cares about everyone else, yet in the way Fjord\nneeds to be cared about. Theirs is a band of orphans and outcasts. <i>Someone </i>has to care.</p><p>The door opens. \u201cOh. Am I uh,\ninterrupting something?\u201d Caduceus dips his head to see under the doorframe. \u201cI\ncan come back later if you two were having a discussion or something.\u201d</p><p>Fjord was out of Molly\u2019s arms the\ninstant the handle turned. Shame. He had been relaxing into the hug and Molly\nwasn\u2019t done yet. Fjord straightens himself to address Caduceus. \u201cYou\u2019re fine,\nCaduceus. Was there anythin\u2019 you needed?\u201d</p><p>Caduceus ducks into the room. The\nceilings of the Lavish Chateau are high enough for him to walk around\ncomfortably. The doors, not so much. \u201cI was in the mood for some tea but the\nkind I want is in my bag. Would you two like to join me? Castala family. Good people,\ngood tea.\u201d</p><p>Molly remembers that tea. A mug of\nit was put in his hands shortly after his resurrection. First there had been\nCaduceus\u2019s face, pale as mist with a cascade of pink tumbling down towards him.\nThen a wave of some glowing crystal on the end of a staff which made all the\nnerves in Molly\u2019s body tingle, like it was rapidly removing the fatigue after\nwaking up from a deep sleep. His friends were there, plus Nila the firbolg, and\nas soon as Molly sat up he was almost knocked down again by an exuberant Nott.\nCaleb had told her to let Molly have space to breathe. That was when Caduceus\ngave him the tea. The very first word Molly said was \u201cThanks.\u201d It was far\nbetter than \u201cEmpty\u201d and at least he could remember everything. Almost\neverything.</p><p>Fjord politely declines the tea. \u201cI\u2019ll\ntake some,\u201d Molly says. \u201cAfter all, if you\u2019re getting your kettle out and\neverything, better to do it for more than just yourself, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they have the hot water\ndownstairs, but I sampled some of their tea leaves and I prefer my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Fjord says. \u201cDidn\u2019t think\nthey served tea here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s why their selection\nis so poor,\u201d Caduceus says. \u201cNo one ever asks for it.\u201d He has that smile on his\nface. It looks permanent, as though it\u2019s just the way his face always was and\nalways will go back to when he\u2019s at rest. Even a few times when Molly has been\nup for the night watch he has seen Caduceus smile like that in his sleep. Other\ntimes, though\u2026 And in those deep eyes Molly can see the way he\u2019s looking at the\ntwo of them. Not angry. Not worried. Just observing. One day Molly will\nunderstand this firbolg. Maybe.</p><p>Molly puts on his own smile. \u201cWell,\nbest not let that hot water wait any longer. Let\u2019s go. You coming, Fjord? You\ndon\u2019t need to drink, but it\u2019s company if you want it.\u201d</p><p>Fjord glances down at his falchion.\n\u201cNo. I\u2019ll stay here, but thanks.\u201d To Caduceus he says, \u201cQuick question.\u201d</p><p>Caduceus tilts his head. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think swords, uh, feel\nbetter after you polish them?\u201d</p><p>Caduceus thinks for a moment. \u201cMy\nstaff shines brighter when I polish it. The wood appreciates being taken care\nof, too. I don\u2019t know about swords though, especially ones like yours. Whoever\ngave it to you might like that you\u2019re taking care of it.\u201d</p><p>Fjord freezes up for a heartbeat. \u201cI\u2026never\nthought of that. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Caduceus\nretrieves the small packet of tea from amongst his belongings. Molly follows\nhim out of the room with a quick check over his shoulder. Fjord is quickly\nsettling back onto the floor and reaching for the whetstone.</p><p>Molly worries about Fjord\nsometimes. Fjord has endeavored time and time again to be the team\u2019s moral anchor,\nbut it\u2019s not easy. Not only is the Mighty Nein comprised of orphans and\noutcasts, but each of them is broken in some way, searching for the missing\npiece to make them whole again. Sometimes the search for those pieces makes\nthem do desperate things, keep dark secrets, act on dangerous impulses. When\nthe Iron Shepherds broke their team in half, Molly had put his life on the line\nput it back together. Even when they were reunited, a few new chips had broken off.\nNow Molly isn\u2019t sure what lengths Fjord will go to in order to keep himself\nfrom breaking further, or if his methods won\u2019t shatter him in the end.</p>",

The gleam in her eyes betrays how\ndelighted she is by the offer. She might even actually share some of that with\nthe rest of the group.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Molly reconsiders that judgement.\nJester has been more of a team player since the Nest. Perhaps it\u2019s out of\nsolidarity to, not only those who saved her, but to Fjord and Yasha, who went\nthrough it all with her. Or maybe it\u2019s because with Caduceus on their team she\nis free to play around with her spells during combat more. She does seem to\nappreciate having the firbolg as an ally.</p><p>Then there are the other\nopportunities he brings. On their way up to Marion\u2019s rooms, Jester had walked\nbeside Molly with a big grin and whispered, \u201cI didn\u2019t get to say anything\nearlier but <i>oh my gosh you totally made\nout with Caduceus!</i>\u201d</p><p>Molly had grinned back. \u201cSo I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was it like?\u201d</p><p>Caduceus was walking ahead of them\nat the time. One of his ears was angled slightly back in their direction.\nKeeping his voice low, but not too low, Molly replied, \u201cMaybe you should try it\nyourself and find out.\u201d</p><p>Jester squealed and pranced\nexcitedly up a few steps. \u201cIt was really good, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Molly shrugged. \u201cA tiefling never\nkisses and tells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d tell you if someone was a good\nkisser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably because you\u2019re only\n<i>half</i>-tiefling, dear.\u201d Molly had\nsmirked as Jester wrinkled her nose in a grumpy pout.</p><p>That little jab hit her harder than\nMolly thought, or it had tipped a decision she was already making, because once\nJester has graciously accepted her mother\u2019s offer, she says, \u201cMama, I want to\ntry sending a message to the Gentleman again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Marion\u2019s expression is hard\nto read, but she continues petting Sprinkles.</p><p>\u201cLike, yesterday I kinda threw a\nlot at him at once. And I think Zadash is far enough east that maybe it was\nlater in the day and I woke him up or something. Can we try to contact him\ntomorrow morning?\u201d</p><p>Marion thinks a moment, face still\ncarefully guarded. \u201cIf that is what you want, then I would be interested to\nhear his reply.\u201d</p><p>Jester gives her mother a hug.\nMarion pats her tenderly on the head. \u201cIf he is my dad, I just want to know why\nhe didn\u2019t come back,\u201d Jester says. \u201cWhen I first left home I thought maybe I\u2019d\ngo live with my dad, but I like being with these guys. Someday maybe I can earn\nenough gold to buy my own house and he can come stay with me.\u201d</p><p>Marion giggles softly. \u201cThat sounds\nlovely.\u201d She sighs. \u201cAnd I must admit, I am\u2026also curious about some things. We\ncan discuss it tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Beau nods. \u201cFor now, we gotta worry\nabout this\u2026LePool? LaPwahl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty sure it\u2019s pronounced \u2018LePual\u2019,\u201d\nFjord says. \u201cAnd we can talk about that over dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me buy that for you, at least,\u201d\nMarion says. \u201cGo downstairs and tell them that whatever you want, it\u2019s on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy thank you,\u201d Molly says with a\ncourteous bow. \u201cYou do serve some excellent cheeses here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe finest,\u201d Marion says. Her\nsmile is so much brighter with this irritation off her conscience. Molly wishes\nhe had enough money to buy an evening with her so he could spend it making her\nlaugh.</p><p>As the group heads downstairs,\nCaduceus stops Molly at the top of the landing. Molly had concerns that Caduceus\nwould be upset by his little stunt earlier, and braces himself for the worst.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you know why I want to\ntalk to you,\u201d Caduceus says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m think I do, yeah.\u201d Molly\nsmiles apologetically. \u201cI was just having some fun, that\u2019s all. Wanted to put\non a show for Fjord.\u201d</p><p>Caduceus nods. He doesn\u2019t look\nangry, nor does he look like he completely buys that excuse. \u201cI don\u2019t think\nFjord found it as amusing as you did. I was fine with it, though, for the\nrecord. Haven\u2019t been kissed like that in a while and, well, frankly it was more\nenjoyable than the last time.\u201d Before Molly has a chance to mentally digest\nthat nugget of information, Caduceus continues, \u201cHowever, there are, uh,\ncertain other members of our party who didn\u2019t find it so funny either. I won\u2019t\nname names because I don\u2019t know if they even know how much it bothered them,\nbut it\u2019s something to keep in mind, yeah?\u201d</p><p>Molly stares up at Caduceus for a\nmoment, processing. There\u2019s something in the firbolg\u2019s eyes that makes the hair\non the back of Molly\u2019s neck prickle. Caduceus is an impressive sight on his\nown, but those eyes\u2026</p><p>\u201cAnd by the way,\u201d Caduceus adds, \u201cI\nlike you too, just not that way.\u201d He reaches down with one broad hand to tousle\nthe hair between Molly\u2019s horns, then lightly chucks Molly under the chin before\nstriding away down the stairs.</p><p>Molly traces the spot on his chin\nwhere Caduceus touched him. \u201cFuck, that was kinda hot.\u201d If Caduceus hadn\u2019t preemptively\nshot down his advances, Molly would have turned up the charm so hard that night\njust to see where he could take things. Mr. Clay was one step ahead though, as\nhe often seemed to be. Molly takes a deep breath then hurries to catch up with\nthe rest.</p><p>Dinner is delicious and decadent, the\nway Molly likes it. He keeps an eye on Caduceus, who doesn\u2019t regard him more\nthan he does anyone else at the table. Fjord is doing most of the talking. He\u2019s\ngoing over what they should tell this guy when they get there, how they can\nconvince him to tell them what they know, what to do if he gets aggressive.</p><p>\u201cWe are going there to <i>talk</i>, okay?\u201d Fjord says. \u201cI\u2019d almost say\nwe should leave our weapons here, but we all remember what happened when we\ntried \u2018just talking\u2019 to that Crick feller.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I remember that,\u201d\nCaduceus says with genuine confusion. \u201cWhen was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd also isn\u2019t \u2018Crick\u2019 a slur?\u201d\nJester asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay, maybe, I dunno. Um, Caduceus,\nthere was this, uh, spy\u2026guy we fought in the sewers once because he wasn\u2019t as\nkeen on talking as we were.\u201d</p><p>Caduceus nods. \u201cAh, I see. Well, I\ncan calm him down if he gets spooked or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. That\u2019s good. We want\ninformation, and we can\u2019t get that if he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmmm, actually we can,\u201d Jester\npoints out. \u201cBoth Caduceus and I can Speak with Dead.\u201d</p><p>Fjord rubs his palm against his\ntemple. \u201cOkay, but let\u2019s not go there with the <i>intent </i>of killing anyone, alright?\u201d</p><p>Everyone agrees with that. There\u2019s\nstill time before midnight, so everyone sort of drifts their separate ways\nafter dinner. Molly heads up to the room he\u2019s sharing with Fjord and Caduceus\nto polish and sharpen his swords. He didn\u2019t have time that morning and he wants\nthem ready if it comes to a fight. He doesn\u2019t want it to. If he could charm his\nway through every situation like he used to in the carnival he would. However,\nout here, in this new life as an adventurer\u2026mercenary\u2026errand-boy-who-specializes-in-danger\u2026whatever\nthey are, most things end on the edge of a blade than on a good word.</p><p>Summer\u2019s Dance is a true beauty.\nMolly cherishes it as one of the finest things he owns, if not THE finest. The\ntapestry is nice, but the tapestry isn\u2019t magical, as far as he knows. The\nPeriapt is the most expensive thing he has ever bought, but it didn\u2019t save him\nin the end, now did it? Besides, if Summer\u2019s Dance <i>is </i>made of real gold, and those <i>are\n</i>real jewels, then it must be worth at least ten times what he paid for the\nnecklace, maybe even a hundred times more. Thinking back to where they found\nit, the case was trapped, so whoever put it in there knew it was valuable.\nDoesn\u2019t matter how much it would cost, though, since he has absolutely no\nintention of selling it any time in the future.</p><p>Molly takes more care in sharpening\nSummer\u2019s Dance than he does with his old swords. Those are flashy, but\nultimately replaceable if he could find the right materials. With Summer\u2019s\nDance he carefully draws the whetstone over the blade, almost lovingly. He hasn\u2019t\nhired any \u201ccompanions\u201d since his resurrection. Everyone expected him to run to\nthe first whore house he passed, and he had thought about it, but he found more\npleasure in getting absolutely shit-faced with the group. He was getting better\nat reducing their hangovers, and the damage he took from that healed faster\nevery time. </p><p>Speaking of which, he tested Summer\u2019s\nDance on himself. A quick slash against the back of his neck, so light he\nbarely felt it and yet the golden sheen was streaked with blood when he withdrew\nit. At his will, the blood let off sparks, crackling with blue energy. That was\nnew. The night after they had raided the Sour Nest, a night where everyone\nagreed they felt more powerful in their victory, Molly had wondered what more\nhe could possibly do. There was that tug in his mind, like an intrusive thought\ntelling him to break a fragile glass or throw himself off a high place, but as\nalways these thoughts told him to attempt feats of magic. Soon after joining\nthe Mighty Nein it told him to try making his blood radiate light, and so it\nhad. Sleeping in the emptied Nest, he contemplated what else his blood could do.\nHe thought of Yasha, passed out beside him, and her connection to the Storm\nLord. Maybe she would like it if he could wield lightning, too.</p><p>Someone knocks on the door. \u201cMolly?\nYou decent?\u201d It\u2019s Fjord.</p><p>Molly wipes off Summer\u2019s Dance. The\nlingering energy makes his fingers tingle. \u201cAs decent as ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026Are you at least wearing pants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come in and see for\nyourself?\u201d Molly asks, arranging himself in a facetiously seductive pose.</p><p>Fjord\u2019s growl is barely audible\nthrough the door. \u201cMolly, come on, I just want to lie down for a little while.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Fine</i>. I swear by the orb in your chest that I am clothed.\u201d</p><p>The door opens. Fjord peeks in\nfirst, then fully enters. \u201cThank you.\u201d He glances at the set up Molly has on\nthe floor. \u201cPraying over your swords?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPolishing them, for now. Prayers\ncome later.\u201d Molly\u2019s prayer has changed recently. It used to be \u201cWhatever I\u2019m\ndoing, let me do it well.\u201d Now it\u2019s \u201cWhatever you let me come back for, let me\novercome it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t really done anything\nwith my sword,\u201d Fjord says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it even <i>needs </i>polishing.\u201d</p><p>Molly shrugs. \u201cIt might like it if\nyou did once in a while.\u201d He keeps his tone subtle, but he watches to see if\nFjord caught the double entendre.</p><p>As always, Fjord is oblivious as\nfuck. \u201cWould it? D\u2019you\u2026 D\u2019you think it <i>thinks</i>?\u201d\nFjord furrows his brow in concern. He holds out his hand and with a splash of\nseawater he summons his falchion. A few drops get on Summer\u2019s Dance, so Molly quickly\nwipes them off with his rag. \u201cSorry,\u201d Fjord mumbles. He\u2019s examining the\nfalchion. That damn eye in the hilt is creepy. It looks like one of Fjord\u2019s\neyes, though, just more unsettling because it\u2019s staring out from a place where\nit wasn\u2019t before. Fjord checks that, too. He turns the blade over in his hands,\nwatching it as it watches\u2026whatever it\u2019s looking at.</p><p>Molly pats the ground beside him. \u201cC\u2019mon,\nyou can borrow my whetstone.\u201d He shakes his finger at the falchion. \u201cIf that\nthing infects it with some kind of curse or makes my swords smell like salt\nwater, you\u2019re buying me a new one.\u201d</p><p>Fjord chuckles. \u201cYeah, alright.\nThanks.\u201d He sits besides Molly and takes the whetstone from his hand. He\u2019s\ndelicate about it, barely letting their skin touch. Molly thinks about what\nCaduceus said. Could Fjord be\u2026? No. As funny as that would be, and as much as\nMolly would like it, no.</p><p>\u201cNervous about tonight?\u201d Molly\nasks.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Fjord runs the whetstone\nalong the edge of his falchion. His eyes are glazed in concentration.</p><p>Seeing their swords side-by-side,\nMolly notices that a falchion is essentially a scimitar without the curves. He\nlikes his swords better. He picks up Summer\u2019s Dance and continues polishing it.\nThe jewels shine back at him. If swords <i>do\n</i>think, then Summer\u2019s Dance must be happy that Molly keeps it looking so\nbeautiful. Fjord\u2019s sword reminds Molly of him; it\u2019s not what one would call\nmajestic, and clearly it has been somewhere that left its mark, but it\u2019s still\nquite the sword. It does seem like it doesn\u2019t need anyone to maintain it, but\nFjord needs something to occupy him for now and this at least <i>feels </i>productive even if it\u2019s pointless.</p><p>\u201cSo if your sword looks different\nbecause you ate someone else\u2019s sword,\u201d Molly says, \u201cdoes that mean it\u2019ll keep\ngetting bigger and meaner the more swords you eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. And I don\u2019t really\nwant to explore that.\u201d Fjord tests the tip of the blade with his thumb. He\ntilts his head then leans in close to focus on it with the whetstone.</p><p>\u201cDoes everything you swallow go\ninto the sword?\u201d</p><p>Fjord frowns. \u201cNo. And I don\u2019t want\nto explore that either. Besides, I don\u2019t\u2026it\u2019s not that I <i>eat </i>the swords or whatever, they just get\u2026y\u2019know\u2026consumed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill goes into you first.\u201d Molly\ndigs a fleck of something out of the setting around what might be an emerald. \u201cBut,\nas someone who has had a blade in his chest, I can see why you wouldn\u2019t want to\nstick any more in there.\u201d</p><p>Whatever frustration or focus\netched the lines in Fjord\u2019s face, it quickly melts to melancholy and guilt. \u201cMolly,\nI\u2019m so sorry that happened to you. You didn\u2019t have to. The rest of you should\nhave left us behind.\u201d</p><p>Molly rolls his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re not\nhaving this discussion again. Of <i>course </i>we\nwere always going to come after you. Doesn\u2019t matter if Tiamat herself took you,\nyou\u2019re our friends. <i>You </i>are <i>my </i>friend. If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve\nlearned in my short time it\u2019s that you don\u2019t abandon someone when they\u2019re in\ntrouble, especially an ally.\u201d</p><p>Fjord half-smiles. He hasn\u2019t looked\nat Molly this whole time. \u201cThank you. I hope one day I can deserve that sort of\nfriendship.\u201d</p><p>Molly playfully slaps Fjord with\nhis tail. \u201cLike I said, we\u2019re not talking about that.\u201d He rests his elbow\nagainst his knee and props his chin against his fist. \u201cDo you need a hug?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d It\u2019s too quick of a response.\nDespite the finality in his tone, Fjord darts his eyes towards Molly long\nenough to give reasonable doubt.</p><p>Molly grins. \u201cDo you <i>want </i>a hug?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014 Thank you, but\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026But what?\u201d</p><p>Fjord grits his teeth. \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018What for?\u2019 For\ngods\u2019 sakes, it\u2019s a hug. You hug the people you like when they need a reminder\nthat someone cares about them. Or because one or both of you wants it. So, do\nyou want \u2014 and/or need \u2014 a hug?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promise it\u2014\u201d Fjord clears his\nthroat. \u201cIt\u2019s just a hug, right? Not like\u2026like\u2026\u201d He mimes something that\nreminds Molly of his moment with Caduceus. He\u2019s trying so hard not to blush and\nfailing so spectacularly that Molly can\u2019t help but laugh.</p><p>\u201cNo surprises, I promise. I wasn\u2019t\nlying about having pants on, was I?\u201d Molly gets to his feet and holds out his\narms. \u201cGet over here, sailor.\u201d</p><p>With some hesitation, Fjord sets\ndown the falchion so he can push himself up. He takes a few awkward steps in\nMolly\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cUgh, I swear you can be worse than\nBeau and Caleb combined.\u201d Molly beckons with his hands still outstretched. \u201cIt\u2019ll\nbe over soon and you\u2019ll feel better afterwards. C\u2019mon.\u201d</p><p>Fjord finally walks into the hug\nwith his arms slumped forward to sort of hold Molly by his sides. Molly puts\none arm around Fjord\u2019s waist and uses the other to pat Fjord on the back.\nThough he doesn\u2019t want to be too sappy, Molly also tries to convey through the\npressure and positioning of his hug that he does genuinely care. He cares that\nFjord is on edge now that he\u2019s close to learning more about his powers. He\ncares that Fjord has been more distant and quiet since the Nest. He cares about\nFjord in general, the way he cares about everyone else, yet in the way Fjord\nneeds to be cared about. Theirs is a band of orphans and outcasts. <i>Someone </i>has to care.</p><p>The door opens. \u201cOh. Am I uh,\ninterrupting something?\u201d Caduceus dips his head to see under the doorframe. \u201cI\ncan come back later if you two were having a discussion or something.\u201d</p><p>Fjord was out of Molly\u2019s arms the\ninstant the handle turned. Shame. He had been relaxing into the hug and Molly\nwasn\u2019t done yet. Fjord straightens himself to address Caduceus. \u201cYou\u2019re fine,\nCaduceus. Was there anythin\u2019 you needed?\u201d</p><p>Caduceus ducks into the room. The\nceilings of the Lavish Chateau are high enough for him to walk around\ncomfortably. The doors, not so much. \u201cI was in the mood for some tea but the\nkind I want is in my bag. Would you two like to join me? Castala family. Good people,\ngood tea.\u201d</p><p>Molly remembers that tea. A mug of\nit was put in his hands shortly after his resurrection. First there had been\nCaduceus\u2019s face, pale as mist with a cascade of pink tumbling down towards him.\nThen a wave of some glowing crystal on the end of a staff which made all the\nnerves in Molly\u2019s body tingle, like it was rapidly removing the fatigue after\nwaking up from a deep sleep. His friends were there, plus Nila the firbolg, and\nas soon as Molly sat up he was almost knocked down again by an exuberant Nott.\nCaleb had told her to let Molly have space to breathe. That was when Caduceus\ngave him the tea. The very first word Molly said was \u201cThanks.\u201d It was far\nbetter than \u201cEmpty\u201d and at least he could remember everything. Almost\neverything.</p><p>Fjord politely declines the tea. \u201cI\u2019ll\ntake some,\u201d Molly says. \u201cAfter all, if you\u2019re getting your kettle out and\neverything, better to do it for more than just yourself, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they have the hot water\ndownstairs, but I sampled some of their tea leaves and I prefer my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Fjord says. \u201cDidn\u2019t think\nthey served tea here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s why their selection\nis so poor,\u201d Caduceus says. \u201cNo one ever asks for it.\u201d He has that smile on his\nface. It looks permanent, as though it\u2019s just the way his face always was and\nalways will go back to when he\u2019s at rest. Even a few times when Molly has been\nup for the night watch he has seen Caduceus smile like that in his sleep. Other\ntimes, though\u2026 And in those deep eyes Molly can see the way he\u2019s looking at the\ntwo of them. Not angry. Not worried. Just observing. One day Molly will\nunderstand this firbolg. Maybe.</p><p>Molly puts on his own smile. \u201cWell,\nbest not let that hot water wait any longer. Let\u2019s go. You coming, Fjord? You\ndon\u2019t need to drink, but it\u2019s company if you want it.\u201d</p><p>Fjord glances down at his falchion.\n\u201cNo. I\u2019ll stay here, but thanks.\u201d To Caduceus he says, \u201cQuick question.\u201d</p><p>Caduceus tilts his head. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think swords, uh, feel\nbetter after you polish them?\u201d</p><p>Caduceus thinks for a moment. \u201cMy\nstaff shines brighter when I polish it. The wood appreciates being taken care\nof, too. I don\u2019t know about swords though, especially ones like yours. Whoever\ngave it to you might like that you\u2019re taking care of it.\u201d</p><p>Fjord freezes up for a heartbeat. \u201cI\u2026never\nthought of that. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Caduceus\nretrieves the small packet of tea from amongst his belongings. Molly follows\nhim out of the room with a quick check over his shoulder. Fjord is quickly\nsettling back onto the floor and reaching for the whetstone.</p><p>Molly worries about Fjord\nsometimes. Fjord has endeavored time and time again to be the team\u2019s moral anchor,\nbut it\u2019s not easy. Not only is the Mighty Nein comprised of orphans and\noutcasts, but each of them is broken in some way, searching for the missing\npiece to make them whole again. Sometimes the search for those pieces makes\nthem do desperate things, keep dark secrets, act on dangerous impulses. When\nthe Iron Shepherds broke their team in half, Molly had put his life on the line\nput it back together. Even when they were reunited, a few new chips had broken off.\nNow Molly isn\u2019t sure what lengths Fjord will go to in order to keep himself\nfrom breaking further, or if his methods won\u2019t shatter him in the end.</p>",

As you said, this is\nmuch better for business.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cGlad we could be of help, ma\u2019am,\u201d\nFjord says.</p><p>\u201cPlease, let me give you some gold\nas a token of my gratitude.\u201d</p><p>Fjord puts up his hands. \u201cYou don\u2019t\nhave to do that. You\u2019ve already helped us by giving us a place to stay.\u201d</p><p>Marion turns to Jester. \u201cWhat if I\ngave <i>you</i> some gold and you can share\nit with your friends? Say, seven hundred?\u201d</p><p>Jester\u2019s eyes go wide. \u201cMama! You\ndon\u2019t have to give us that much!\u201d</p><p>Her mother shrugs. \u201cConsider it\nyour allowance for the next few months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026okay, if it\u2019s my allowance\u2026\u201d It\ndidn\u2019t take much to twist Jester\u2019s arm. The gleam in her eyes betrays how\ndelighted she is by the offer. She might even actually share some of that with\nthe rest of the group.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Molly reconsiders that judgement.\nJester has been more of a team player since the Nest. Perhaps it\u2019s out of\nsolidarity to, not only those who saved her, but to Fjord and Yasha, who went\nthrough it all with her. Or maybe it\u2019s because with Caduceus on their team she\nis free to play around with her spells during combat more. She does seem to\nappreciate having the firbolg as an ally.</p><p>Then there are the other\nopportunities he brings. On their way up to Marion\u2019s rooms, Jester had walked\nbeside Molly with a big grin and whispered, \u201cI didn\u2019t get to say anything\nearlier but <i>oh my gosh you totally made\nout with Caduceus!</i>\u201d</p><p>Molly had grinned back. \u201cSo I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was it like?\u201d</p><p>Caduceus was walking ahead of them\nat the time. One of his ears was angled slightly back in their direction.\nKeeping his voice low, but not too low, Molly replied, \u201cMaybe you should try it\nyourself and find out.\u201d</p><p>Jester squealed and pranced\nexcitedly up a few steps. \u201cIt was really good, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Molly shrugged. \u201cA tiefling never\nkisses and tells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d tell you if someone was a good\nkisser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably because you\u2019re only\n<i>half</i>-tiefling, dear.\u201d Molly had\nsmirked as Jester wrinkled her nose in a grumpy pout.</p><p>That little jab hit her harder than\nMolly thought, or it had tipped a decision she was already making, because once\nJester has graciously accepted her mother\u2019s offer, she says, \u201cMama, I want to\ntry sending a message to the Gentleman again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Marion\u2019s expression is hard\nto read, but she continues petting Sprinkles.</p><p>\u201cLike, yesterday I kinda threw a\nlot at him at once. And I think Zadash is far enough east that maybe it was\nlater in the day and I woke him up or something. Can we try to contact him\ntomorrow morning?\u201d</p><p>Marion thinks a moment, face still\ncarefully guarded. \u201cIf that is what you want, then I would be interested to\nhear his reply.\u201d</p><p>Jester gives her mother a hug.\nMarion pats her tenderly on the head. \u201cIf he is my dad, I just want to know why\nhe didn\u2019t come back,\u201d Jester says. \u201cWhen I first left home I thought maybe I\u2019d\ngo live with my dad, but I like being with these guys. Someday maybe I can earn\nenough gold to buy my own house and he can come stay with me.\u201d</p><p>Marion giggles softly. \u201cThat sounds\nlovely.\u201d She sighs. \u201cAnd I must admit, I am\u2026also curious about some things. We\ncan discuss it tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Beau nods. \u201cFor now, we gotta worry\nabout this\u2026LePool? LaPwahl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty sure it\u2019s pronounced \u2018LePual\u2019,\u201d\nFjord says. \u201cAnd we can talk about that over dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me buy that for you, at least,\u201d\nMarion says. \u201cGo downstairs and tell them that whatever you want, it\u2019s on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy thank you,\u201d Molly says with a\ncourteous bow. \u201cYou do serve some excellent cheeses here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe finest,\u201d Marion says. Her\nsmile is so much brighter with this irritation off her conscience. Molly wishes\nhe had enough money to buy an evening with her so he could spend it making her\nlaugh.</p><p>As the group heads downstairs,\nCaduceus stops Molly at the top of the landing. Molly had concerns that Caduceus\nwould be upset by his little stunt earlier, and braces himself for the worst.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you know why I want to\ntalk to you,\u201d Caduceus says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m think I do, yeah.\u201d Molly\nsmiles apologetically. \u201cI was just having some fun, that\u2019s all. Wanted to put\non a show for Fjord.\u201d</p><p>Caduceus nods. He doesn\u2019t look\nangry, nor does he look like he completely buys that excuse. \u201cI don\u2019t think\nFjord found it as amusing as you did. I was fine with it, though, for the\nrecord. Haven\u2019t been kissed like that in a while and, well, frankly it was more\nenjoyable than the last time.\u201d Before Molly has a chance to mentally digest\nthat nugget of information, Caduceus continues, \u201cHowever, there are, uh,\ncertain other members of our party who didn\u2019t find it so funny either. I won\u2019t\nname names because I don\u2019t know if they even know how much it bothered them,\nbut it\u2019s something to keep in mind, yeah?\u201d</p><p>Molly stares up at Caduceus for a\nmoment, processing. There\u2019s something in the firbolg\u2019s eyes that makes the hair\non the back of Molly\u2019s neck prickle. Caduceus is an impressive sight on his\nown, but those eyes\u2026</p><p>\u201cAnd by the way,\u201d Caduceus adds, \u201cI\nlike you too, just not that way.\u201d He reaches down with one broad hand to tousle\nthe hair between Molly\u2019s horns, then lightly chucks Molly under the chin before\nstriding away down the stairs.</p><p>Molly traces the spot on his chin\nwhere Caduceus touched him. \u201cFuck, that was kinda hot.\u201d If Caduceus hadn\u2019t preemptively\nshot down his advances, Molly would have turned up the charm so hard that night\njust to see where he could take things. Mr. Clay was one step ahead though, as\nhe often seemed to be. Molly takes a deep breath then hurries to catch up with\nthe rest.</p><p>Dinner is delicious and decadent, the\nway Molly likes it. He keeps an eye on Caduceus, who doesn\u2019t regard him more\nthan he does anyone else at the table. Fjord is doing most of the talking. He\u2019s\ngoing over what they should tell this guy when they get there, how they can\nconvince him to tell them what they know, what to do if he gets aggressive.</p><p>\u201cWe are going there to <i>talk</i>, okay?\u201d Fjord says. \u201cI\u2019d almost say\nwe should leave our weapons here, but we all remember what happened when we\ntried \u2018just talking\u2019 to that Crick feller.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I remember that,\u201d\nCaduceus says with genuine confusion. \u201cWhen was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd also isn\u2019t \u2018Crick\u2019 a slur?\u201d\nJester asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay, maybe, I dunno. Um, Caduceus,\nthere was this, uh, spy\u2026guy we fought in the sewers once because he wasn\u2019t as\nkeen on talking as we were.\u201d</p><p>Caduceus nods. \u201cAh, I see. Well, I\ncan calm him down if he gets spooked or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. That\u2019s good. We want\ninformation, and we can\u2019t get that if he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmmm, actually we can,\u201d Jester\npoints out. \u201cBoth Caduceus and I can Speak with Dead.\u201d</p><p>Fjord rubs his palm against his\ntemple. \u201cOkay, but let\u2019s not go there with the <i>intent </i>of killing anyone, alright?\u201d</p><p>Everyone agrees with that. There\u2019s\nstill time before midnight, so everyone sort of drifts their separate ways\nafter dinner. Molly heads up to the room he\u2019s sharing with Fjord and Caduceus\nto polish and sharpen his swords. He didn\u2019t have time that morning and he wants\nthem ready if it comes to a fight. He doesn\u2019t want it to. If he could charm his\nway through every situation like he used to in the carnival he would. However,\nout here, in this new life as an adventurer\u2026mercenary\u2026errand-boy-who-specializes-in-danger\u2026whatever\nthey are, most things end on the edge of a blade than on a good word.</p><p>Summer\u2019s Dance is a true beauty.\nMolly cherishes it as one of the finest things he owns, if not THE finest. The\ntapestry is nice, but the tapestry isn\u2019t magical, as far as he knows. The\nPeriapt is the most expensive thing he has ever bought, but it didn\u2019t save him\nin the end, now did it? Besides, if Summer\u2019s Dance <i>is </i>made of real gold, and those <i>are\n</i>real jewels, then it must be worth at least ten times what he paid for the\nnecklace, maybe even a hundred times more. Thinking back to where they found\nit, the case was trapped, so whoever put it in there knew it was valuable.\nDoesn\u2019t matter how much it would cost, though, since he has absolutely no\nintention of selling it any time in the future.</p><p>Molly takes more care in sharpening\nSummer\u2019s Dance than he does with his old swords. Those are flashy, but\nultimately replaceable if he could find the right materials. With Summer\u2019s\nDance he carefully draws the whetstone over the blade, almost lovingly. He hasn\u2019t\nhired any \u201ccompanions\u201d since his resurrection. Everyone expected him to run to\nthe first whore house he passed, and he had thought about it, but he found more\npleasure in getting absolutely shit-faced with the group. He was getting better\nat reducing their hangovers, and the damage he took from that healed faster\nevery time. </p><p>Speaking of which, he tested Summer\u2019s\nDance on himself. A quick slash against the back of his neck, so light he\nbarely felt it and yet the golden sheen was streaked with blood when he withdrew\nit. At his will, the blood let off sparks, crackling with blue energy. That was\nnew. The night after they had raided the Sour Nest, a night where everyone\nagreed they felt more powerful in their victory, Molly had wondered what more\nhe could possibly do. There was that tug in his mind, like an intrusive thought\ntelling him to break a fragile glass or throw himself off a high place, but as\nalways these thoughts told him to attempt feats of magic. Soon after joining\nthe Mighty Nein it told him to try making his blood radiate light, and so it\nhad. Sleeping in the emptied Nest, he contemplated what else his blood could do.\nHe thought of Yasha, passed out beside him, and her connection to the Storm\nLord. Maybe she would like it if he could wield lightning, too.</p><p>Someone knocks on the door. \u201cMolly?\nYou decent?\u201d It\u2019s Fjord.</p><p>Molly wipes off Summer\u2019s Dance. The\nlingering energy makes his fingers tingle. \u201cAs decent as ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026Are you at least wearing pants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come in and see for\nyourself?\u201d Molly asks, arranging himself in a facetiously seductive pose.</p><p>Fjord\u2019s growl is barely audible\nthrough the door. \u201cMolly, come on, I just want to lie down for a little while.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Fine</i>. I swear by the orb in your chest that I am clothed.\u201d</p><p>The door opens. Fjord peeks in\nfirst, then fully enters. \u201cThank you.\u201d He glances at the set up Molly has on\nthe floor. \u201cPraying over your swords?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPolishing them, for now. Prayers\ncome later.\u201d Molly\u2019s prayer has changed recently. It used to be \u201cWhatever I\u2019m\ndoing, let me do it well.\u201d Now it\u2019s \u201cWhatever you let me come back for, let me\novercome it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t really done anything\nwith my sword,\u201d Fjord says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it even <i>needs </i>polishing.\u201d</p><p>Molly shrugs. \u201cIt might like it if\nyou did once in a while.\u201d He keeps his tone subtle, but he watches to see if\nFjord caught the double entendre.</p><p>As always, Fjord is oblivious as\nfuck. \u201cWould it? D\u2019you\u2026 D\u2019you think it <i>thinks</i>?\u201d\nFjord furrows his brow in concern. He holds out his hand and with a splash of\nseawater he summons his falchion. A few drops get on Summer\u2019s Dance, so Molly quickly\nwipes them off with his rag. \u201cSorry,\u201d Fjord mumbles. He\u2019s examining the\nfalchion. That damn eye in the hilt is creepy. It looks like one of Fjord\u2019s\neyes, though, just more unsettling because it\u2019s staring out from a place where\nit wasn\u2019t before. Fjord checks that, too. He turns the blade over in his hands,\nwatching it as it watches\u2026whatever it\u2019s looking at.</p><p>Molly pats the ground beside him. \u201cC\u2019mon,\nyou can borrow my whetstone.\u201d He shakes his finger at the falchion. \u201cIf that\nthing infects it with some kind of curse or makes my swords smell like salt\nwater, you\u2019re buying me a new one.\u201d</p><p>Fjord chuckles. \u201cYeah, alright.\nThanks.\u201d He sits besides Molly and takes the whetstone from his hand. He\u2019s\ndelicate about it, barely letting their skin touch. Molly thinks about what\nCaduceus said. Could Fjord be\u2026? No. As funny as that would be, and as much as\nMolly would like it, no.</p><p>\u201cNervous about tonight?\u201d Molly\nasks.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Fjord runs the whetstone\nalong the edge of his falchion. His eyes are glazed in concentration.</p><p>Seeing their swords side-by-side,\nMolly notices that a falchion is essentially a scimitar without the curves. He\nlikes his swords better. He picks up Summer\u2019s Dance and continues polishing it.\nThe jewels shine back at him. If swords <i>do\n</i>think, then Summer\u2019s Dance must be happy that Molly keeps it looking so\nbeautiful. Fjord\u2019s sword reminds Molly of him; it\u2019s not what one would call\nmajestic, and clearly it has been somewhere that left its mark, but it\u2019s still\nquite the sword. It does seem like it doesn\u2019t need anyone to maintain it, but\nFjord needs something to occupy him for now and this at least <i>feels </i>productive even if it\u2019s pointless.</p><p>\u201cSo if your sword looks different\nbecause you ate someone else\u2019s sword,\u201d Molly says, \u201cdoes that mean it\u2019ll keep\ngetting bigger and meaner the more swords you eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. And I don\u2019t really\nwant to explore that.\u201d Fjord tests the tip of the blade with his thumb. He\ntilts his head then leans in close to focus on it with the whetstone.</p><p>\u201cDoes everything you swallow go\ninto the sword?\u201d</p><p>Fjord frowns. \u201cNo. And I don\u2019t want\nto explore that either. Besides, I don\u2019t\u2026it\u2019s not that I <i>eat </i>the swords or whatever, they just get\u2026y\u2019know\u2026consumed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill goes into you first.\u201d Molly\ndigs a fleck of something out of the setting around what might be an emerald. \u201cBut,\nas someone who has had a blade in his chest, I can see why you wouldn\u2019t want to\nstick any more in there.\u201d</p><p>Whatever frustration or focus\netched the lines in Fjord\u2019s face, it quickly melts to melancholy and guilt. \u201cMolly,\nI\u2019m so sorry that happened to you. You didn\u2019t have to. The rest of you should\nhave left us behind.\u201d</p><p>Molly rolls his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re not\nhaving this discussion again. Of <i>course </i>we\nwere always going to come after you. Doesn\u2019t matter if Tiamat herself took you,\nyou\u2019re our friends. <i>You </i>are <i>my </i>friend. If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve\nlearned in my short time it\u2019s that you don\u2019t abandon someone when they\u2019re in\ntrouble, especially an ally.\u201d</p><p>Fjord half-smiles. He hasn\u2019t looked\nat Molly this whole time. \u201cThank you. I hope one day I can deserve that sort of\nfriendship.\u201d</p><p>Molly playfully slaps Fjord with\nhis tail. \u201cLike I said, we\u2019re not talking about that.\u201d He rests his elbow\nagainst his knee and props his chin against his fist. \u201cDo you need a hug?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d It\u2019s too quick of a response.\nDespite the finality in his tone, Fjord darts his eyes towards Molly long\nenough to give reasonable doubt.</p><p>Molly grins. \u201cDo you <i>want </i>a hug?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014 Thank you, but\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026But what?\u201d</p><p>Fjord grits his teeth. \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018What for?\u2019 For\ngods\u2019 sakes, it\u2019s a hug. You hug the people you like when they need a reminder\nthat someone cares about them. Or because one or both of you wants it. So, do\nyou want \u2014 and/or need \u2014 a hug?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promise it\u2014\u201d Fjord clears his\nthroat. \u201cIt\u2019s just a hug, right? Not like\u2026like\u2026\u201d He mimes something that\nreminds Molly of his moment with Caduceus. He\u2019s trying so hard not to blush and\nfailing so spectacularly that Molly can\u2019t help but laugh.</p><p>\u201cNo surprises, I promise. I wasn\u2019t\nlying about having pants on, was I?\u201d Molly gets to his feet and holds out his\narms. \u201cGet over here, sailor.\u201d</p><p>With some hesitation, Fjord sets\ndown the falchion so he can push himself up. He takes a few awkward steps in\nMolly\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cUgh, I swear you can be worse than\nBeau and Caleb combined.\u201d Molly beckons with his hands still outstretched. \u201cIt\u2019ll\nbe over soon and you\u2019ll feel better afterwards. C\u2019mon.\u201d</p><p>Fjord finally walks into the hug\nwith his arms slumped forward to sort of hold Molly by his sides. Molly puts\none arm around Fjord\u2019s waist and uses the other to pat Fjord on the back.\nThough he doesn\u2019t want to be too sappy, Molly also tries to convey through the\npressure and positioning of his hug that he does genuinely care. He cares that\nFjord is on edge now that he\u2019s close to learning more about his powers. He\ncares that Fjord has been more distant and quiet since the Nest. He cares about\nFjord in general, the way he cares about everyone else, yet in the way Fjord\nneeds to be cared about. Theirs is a band of orphans and outcasts. <i>Someone </i>has to care.</p><p>The door opens. \u201cOh. Am I uh,\ninterrupting something?\u201d Caduceus dips his head to see under the doorframe. \u201cI\ncan come back later if you two were having a discussion or something.\u201d</p><p>Fjord was out of Molly\u2019s arms the\ninstant the handle turned. Shame. He had been relaxing into the hug and Molly\nwasn\u2019t done yet. Fjord straightens himself to address Caduceus. \u201cYou\u2019re fine,\nCaduceus. Was there anythin\u2019 you needed?\u201d</p><p>Caduceus ducks into the room. The\nceilings of the Lavish Chateau are high enough for him to walk around\ncomfortably. The doors, not so much. \u201cI was in the mood for some tea but the\nkind I want is in my bag. Would you two like to join me? Castala family. Good people,\ngood tea.\u201d</p><p>Molly remembers that tea. A mug of\nit was put in his hands shortly after his resurrection. First there had been\nCaduceus\u2019s face, pale as mist with a cascade of pink tumbling down towards him.\nThen a wave of some glowing crystal on the end of a staff which made all the\nnerves in Molly\u2019s body tingle, like it was rapidly removing the fatigue after\nwaking up from a deep sleep. His friends were there, plus Nila the firbolg, and\nas soon as Molly sat up he was almost knocked down again by an exuberant Nott.\nCaleb had told her to let Molly have space to breathe. That was when Caduceus\ngave him the tea. The very first word Molly said was \u201cThanks.\u201d It was far\nbetter than \u201cEmpty\u201d and at least he could remember everything. Almost\neverything.</p><p>Fjord politely declines the tea. \u201cI\u2019ll\ntake some,\u201d Molly says. \u201cAfter all, if you\u2019re getting your kettle out and\neverything, better to do it for more than just yourself, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they have the hot water\ndownstairs, but I sampled some of their tea leaves and I prefer my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Fjord says. \u201cDidn\u2019t think\nthey served tea here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s why their selection\nis so poor,\u201d Caduceus says. \u201cNo one ever asks for it.\u201d He has that smile on his\nface. It looks permanent, as though it\u2019s just the way his face always was and\nalways will go back to when he\u2019s at rest. Even a few times when Molly has been\nup for the night watch he has seen Caduceus smile like that in his sleep. Other\ntimes, though\u2026 And in those deep eyes Molly can see the way he\u2019s looking at the\ntwo of them. Not angry. Not worried. Just observing. One day Molly will\nunderstand this firbolg. Maybe.</p><p>Molly puts on his own smile. \u201cWell,\nbest not let that hot water wait any longer. Let\u2019s go. You coming, Fjord? You\ndon\u2019t need to drink, but it\u2019s company if you want it.\u201d</p><p>Fjord glances down at his falchion.\n\u201cNo. I\u2019ll stay here, but thanks.\u201d To Caduceus he says, \u201cQuick question.\u201d</p><p>Caduceus tilts his head. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think swords, uh, feel\nbetter after you polish them?\u201d</p><p>Caduceus thinks for a moment. \u201cMy\nstaff shines brighter when I polish it. The wood appreciates being taken care\nof, too. I don\u2019t know about swords though, especially ones like yours. Whoever\ngave it to you might like that you\u2019re taking care of it.\u201d</p><p>Fjord freezes up for a heartbeat. \u201cI\u2026never\nthought of that. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Caduceus\nretrieves the small packet of tea from amongst his belongings. Molly follows\nhim out of the room with a quick check over his shoulder. Fjord is quickly\nsettling back onto the floor and reaching for the whetstone.</p><p>Molly worries about Fjord\nsometimes. Fjord has endeavored time and time again to be the team\u2019s moral anchor,\nbut it\u2019s not easy. Not only is the Mighty Nein comprised of orphans and\noutcasts, but each of them is broken in some way, searching for the missing\npiece to make them whole again. Sometimes the search for those pieces makes\nthem do desperate things, keep dark secrets, act on dangerous impulses. When\nthe Iron Shepherds broke their team in half, Molly had put his life on the line\nput it back together. Even when they were reunited, a few new chips had broken off.\nNow Molly isn\u2019t sure what lengths Fjord will go to in order to keep himself\nfrom breaking further, or if his methods won\u2019t shatter him in the end.</p>",

As you said, this is\nmuch better for business.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Glad we could be of help, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo;\nFjord says.</p><p>&ldquo;Please, let me give you some gold\nas a token of my gratitude.&rdquo;</p><p>Fjord puts up his hands. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t\nhave to do that. You&rsquo;ve already helped us by giving us a place to stay.&rdquo;</p><p>Marion turns to Jester. &ldquo;What if I\ngave <i>you</i> some gold and you can share\nit with your friends? Say, seven hundred?&rdquo;</p><p>Jester&rsquo;s eyes go wide. &ldquo;Mama! You\ndon&rsquo;t have to give us that much!&rdquo;</p><p>Her mother shrugs. &ldquo;Consider it\nyour allowance for the next few months.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip;okay, if it&rsquo;s my allowance&hellip;&rdquo; It\ndidn&rsquo;t take much to twist Jester&rsquo;s arm. The gleam in her eyes betrays how\ndelighted she is by the offer. She might even actually share some of that with\nthe rest of the group.</p><p>Molly reconsiders that judgement.\nJester has been more of a team player since the Nest. Perhaps it&rsquo;s out of\nsolidarity to, not only those who saved her, but to Fjord and Yasha, who went\nthrough it all with her. Or maybe it&rsquo;s because with Caduceus on their team she\nis free to play around with her spells during combat more. She does seem to\nappreciate having the firbolg as an ally.</p><p>Then there are the other\nopportunities he brings. On their way up to Marion&rsquo;s rooms, Jester had walked\nbeside Molly with a big grin and whispered, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get to say anything\nearlier but <i>oh my gosh you totally made\nout with Caduceus!</i>&rdquo;</p><p>Molly had grinned back. &ldquo;So I did.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What was it like?&rdquo;</p><p>Caduceus was walking ahead of them\nat the time. One of his ears was angled slightly back in their direction.\nKeeping his voice low, but not too low, Molly replied, &ldquo;Maybe you should try it\nyourself and find out.&rdquo;</p><p>Jester squealed and pranced\nexcitedly up a few steps. &ldquo;It was really good, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>Molly shrugged. &ldquo;A tiefling never\nkisses and tells.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d tell you if someone was a good\nkisser.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s probably because you&rsquo;re only\n<i>half</i>-tiefling, dear.&rdquo; Molly had\nsmirked as Jester wrinkled her nose in a grumpy pout.</p><p>That little jab hit her harder than\nMolly thought, or it had tipped a decision she was already making, because once\nJester has graciously accepted her mother&rsquo;s offer, she says, &ldquo;Mama, I want to\ntry sending a message to the Gentleman again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Marion&rsquo;s expression is hard\nto read, but she continues petting Sprinkles.</p><p>&ldquo;Like, yesterday I kinda threw a\nlot at him at once. And I think Zadash is far enough east that maybe it was\nlater in the day and I woke him up or something. Can we try to contact him\ntomorrow morning?&rdquo;</p><p>Marion thinks a moment, face still\ncarefully guarded. &ldquo;If that is what you want, then I would be interested to\nhear his reply.&rdquo;</p><p>Jester gives her mother a hug.\nMarion pats her tenderly on the head. &ldquo;If he is my dad, I just want to know why\nhe didn&rsquo;t come back,&rdquo; Jester says. &ldquo;When I first left home I thought maybe I&rsquo;d\ngo live with my dad, but I like being with these guys. Someday maybe I can earn\nenough gold to buy my own house and he can come stay with me.&rdquo;</p><p>Marion giggles softly. &ldquo;That sounds\nlovely.&rdquo; She sighs. &ldquo;And I must admit, I am&hellip;also curious about some things. We\ncan discuss it tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p>Beau nods. &ldquo;For now, we gotta worry\nabout this&hellip;LePool? LaPwahl?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pretty sure it&rsquo;s pronounced &lsquo;LePual&rsquo;,&rdquo;\nFjord says. &ldquo;And we can talk about that over dinner.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let me buy that for you, at least,&rdquo;\nMarion says. &ldquo;Go downstairs and tell them that whatever you want, it&rsquo;s on me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why thank you,&rdquo; Molly says with a\ncourteous bow. &ldquo;You do serve some excellent cheeses here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The finest,&rdquo; Marion says. Her\nsmile is so much brighter with this irritation off her conscience. Molly wishes\nhe had enough money to buy an evening with her so he could spend it making her\nlaugh.</p><p>As the group heads downstairs,\nCaduceus stops Molly at the top of the landing. Molly had concerns that Caduceus\nwould be upset by his little stunt earlier, and braces himself for the worst.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you know why I want to\ntalk to you,&rdquo; Caduceus says.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m think I do, yeah.&rdquo; Molly\nsmiles apologetically. &ldquo;I was just having some fun, that&rsquo;s all. Wanted to put\non a show for Fjord.&rdquo;</p><p>Caduceus nods. He doesn&rsquo;t look\nangry, nor does he look like he completely buys that excuse. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think\nFjord found it as amusing as you did. I was fine with it, though, for the\nrecord. Haven&rsquo;t been kissed like that in a while and, well, frankly it was more\nenjoyable than the last time.&rdquo; Before Molly has a chance to mentally digest\nthat nugget of information, Caduceus continues, &ldquo;However, there are, uh,\ncertain other members of our party who didn&rsquo;t find it so funny either. I won&rsquo;t\nname names because I don&rsquo;t know if they even know how much it bothered them,\nbut it&rsquo;s something to keep in mind, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>Molly stares up at Caduceus for a\nmoment, processing. There&rsquo;s something in the firbolg&rsquo;s eyes that makes the hair\non the back of Molly&rsquo;s neck prickle. Caduceus is an impressive sight on his\nown, but those eyes&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;And by the way,&rdquo; Caduceus adds, &ldquo;I\nlike you too, just not that way.&rdquo; He reaches down with one broad hand to tousle\nthe hair between Molly&rsquo;s horns, then lightly chucks Molly under the chin before\nstriding away down the stairs.</p><p>Molly traces the spot on his chin\nwhere Caduceus touched him. &ldquo;Fuck, that was kinda hot.&rdquo; If Caduceus hadn&rsquo;t preemptively\nshot down his advances, Molly would have turned up the charm so hard that night\njust to see where he could take things. Mr. Clay was one step ahead though, as\nhe often seemed to be. Molly takes a deep breath then hurries to catch up with\nthe rest.</p><p>Dinner is delicious and decadent, the\nway Molly likes it. He keeps an eye on Caduceus, who doesn&rsquo;t regard him more\nthan he does anyone else at the table. Fjord is doing most of the talking. He&rsquo;s\ngoing over what they should tell this guy when they get there, how they can\nconvince him to tell them what they know, what to do if he gets aggressive.</p><p>&ldquo;We are going there to <i>talk</i>, okay?&rdquo; Fjord says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d almost say\nwe should leave our weapons here, but we all remember what happened when we\ntried &lsquo;just talking&rsquo; to that Crick feller.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I remember that,&rdquo;\nCaduceus says with genuine confusion. &ldquo;When was that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And also isn&rsquo;t &lsquo;Crick&rsquo; a slur?&rdquo;\nJester asks.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, okay, maybe, I dunno. Um, Caduceus,\nthere was this, uh, spy&hellip;guy we fought in the sewers once because he wasn&rsquo;t as\nkeen on talking as we were.&rdquo;</p><p>Caduceus nods. &ldquo;Ah, I see. Well, I\ncan calm him down if he gets spooked or anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good. That&rsquo;s good. We want\ninformation, and we can&rsquo;t get that if he&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ummm, actually we can,&rdquo; Jester\npoints out. &ldquo;Both Caduceus and I can Speak with Dead.&rdquo;</p><p>Fjord rubs his palm against his\ntemple. &ldquo;Okay, but let&rsquo;s not go there with the <i>intent </i>of killing anyone, alright?&rdquo;</p><p>Everyone agrees with that. There&rsquo;s\nstill time before midnight, so everyone sort of drifts their separate ways\nafter dinner. Molly heads up to the room he&rsquo;s sharing with Fjord and Caduceus\nto polish and sharpen his swords. He didn&rsquo;t have time that morning and he wants\nthem ready if it comes to a fight. He doesn&rsquo;t want it to. If he could charm his\nway through every situation like he used to in the carnival he would. However,\nout here, in this new life as an adventurer&hellip;mercenary&hellip;errand-boy-who-specializes-in-danger&hellip;whatever\nthey are, most things end on the edge of a blade than on a good word.</p><p>Summer&rsquo;s Dance is a true beauty.\nMolly cherishes it as one of the finest things he owns, if not THE finest. The\ntapestry is nice, but the tapestry isn&rsquo;t magical, as far as he knows. The\nPeriapt is the most expensive thing he has ever bought, but it didn&rsquo;t save him\nin the end, now did it? Besides, if Summer&rsquo;s Dance <i>is </i>made of real gold, and those <i>are\n</i>real jewels, then it must be worth at least ten times what he paid for the\nnecklace, maybe even a hundred times more. Thinking back to where they found\nit, the case was trapped, so whoever put it in there knew it was valuable.\nDoesn&rsquo;t matter how much it would cost, though, since he has absolutely no\nintention of selling it any time in the future.</p><p>Molly takes more care in sharpening\nSummer&rsquo;s Dance than he does with his old swords. Those are flashy, but\nultimately replaceable if he could find the right materials. With Summer&rsquo;s\nDance he carefully draws the whetstone over the blade, almost lovingly. He hasn&rsquo;t\nhired any &ldquo;companions&rdquo; since his resurrection. Everyone expected him to run to\nthe first whore house he passed, and he had thought about it, but he found more\npleasure in getting absolutely shit-faced with the group. He was getting better\nat reducing their hangovers, and the damage he took from that healed faster\nevery time. </p><p>Speaking of which, he tested Summer&rsquo;s\nDance on himself. A quick slash against the back of his neck, so light he\nbarely felt it and yet the golden sheen was streaked with blood when he withdrew\nit. At his will, the blood let off sparks, crackling with blue energy. That was\nnew. The night after they had raided the Sour Nest, a night where everyone\nagreed they felt more powerful in their victory, Molly had wondered what more\nhe could possibly do. There was that tug in his mind, like an intrusive thought\ntelling him to break a fragile glass or throw himself off a high place, but as\nalways these thoughts told him to attempt feats of magic. Soon after joining\nthe Mighty Nein it told him to try making his blood radiate light, and so it\nhad. Sleeping in the emptied Nest, he contemplated what else his blood could do.\nHe thought of Yasha, passed out beside him, and her connection to the Storm\nLord. Maybe she would like it if he could wield lightning, too.</p><p>Someone knocks on the door. &ldquo;Molly?\nYou decent?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s Fjord.</p><p>Molly wipes off Summer&rsquo;s Dance. The\nlingering energy makes his fingers tingle. &ldquo;As decent as ever.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;Are you at least wearing pants?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come in and see for\nyourself?&rdquo; Molly asks, arranging himself in a facetiously seductive pose.</p><p>Fjord&rsquo;s growl is barely audible\nthrough the door. &ldquo;Molly, come on, I just want to lie down for a little while.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Fine</i>. I swear by the orb in your chest that I am clothed.&rdquo;</p><p>The door opens. Fjord peeks in\nfirst, then fully enters. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; He glances at the set up Molly has on\nthe floor. &ldquo;Praying over your swords?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Polishing them, for now. Prayers\ncome later.&rdquo; Molly&rsquo;s prayer has changed recently. It used to be &ldquo;Whatever I&rsquo;m\ndoing, let me do it well.&rdquo; Now it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Whatever you let me come back for, let me\novercome it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t really done anything\nwith my sword,&rdquo; Fjord says. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if it even <i>needs </i>polishing.&rdquo;</p><p>Molly shrugs. &ldquo;It might like it if\nyou did once in a while.&rdquo; He keeps his tone subtle, but he watches to see if\nFjord caught the double entendre.</p><p>As always, Fjord is oblivious as\nfuck. &ldquo;Would it? D&rsquo;you&hellip; D&rsquo;you think it <i>thinks</i>?&rdquo;\nFjord furrows his brow in concern. He holds out his hand and with a splash of\nseawater he summons his falchion. A few drops get on Summer&rsquo;s Dance, so Molly quickly\nwipes them off with his rag. &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Fjord mumbles. He&rsquo;s examining the\nfalchion. That damn eye in the hilt is creepy. It looks like one of Fjord&rsquo;s\neyes, though, just more unsettling because it&rsquo;s staring out from a place where\nit wasn&rsquo;t before. Fjord checks that, too. He turns the blade over in his hands,\nwatching it as it watches&hellip;whatever it&rsquo;s looking at.</p><p>Molly pats the ground beside him. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon,\nyou can borrow my whetstone.&rdquo; He shakes his finger at the falchion. &ldquo;If that\nthing infects it with some kind of curse or makes my swords smell like salt\nwater, you&rsquo;re buying me a new one.&rdquo;</p><p>Fjord chuckles. &ldquo;Yeah, alright.\nThanks.&rdquo; He sits besides Molly and takes the whetstone from his hand. He&rsquo;s\ndelicate about it, barely letting their skin touch. Molly thinks about what\nCaduceus said. Could Fjord be&hellip;? No. As funny as that would be, and as much as\nMolly would like it, no.</p><p>&ldquo;Nervous about tonight?&rdquo; Molly\nasks.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Fjord runs the whetstone\nalong the edge of his falchion. His eyes are glazed in concentration.</p><p>Seeing their swords side-by-side,\nMolly notices that a falchion is essentially a scimitar without the curves. He\nlikes his swords better. He picks up Summer&rsquo;s Dance and continues polishing it.\nThe jewels shine back at him. If swords <i>do\n</i>think, then Summer&rsquo;s Dance must be happy that Molly keeps it looking so\nbeautiful. Fjord&rsquo;s sword reminds Molly of him; it&rsquo;s not what one would call\nmajestic, and clearly it has been somewhere that left its mark, but it&rsquo;s still\nquite the sword. It does seem like it doesn&rsquo;t need anyone to maintain it, but\nFjord needs something to occupy him for now and this at least <i>feels </i>productive even if it&rsquo;s pointless.</p><p>&ldquo;So if your sword looks different\nbecause you ate someone else&rsquo;s sword,&rdquo; Molly says, &ldquo;does that mean it&rsquo;ll keep\ngetting bigger and meaner the more swords you eat?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. And I don&rsquo;t really\nwant to explore that.&rdquo; Fjord tests the tip of the blade with his thumb. He\ntilts his head then leans in close to focus on it with the whetstone.</p><p>&ldquo;Does everything you swallow go\ninto the sword?&rdquo;</p><p>Fjord frowns. &ldquo;No. And I don&rsquo;t want\nto explore that either. Besides, I don&rsquo;t&hellip;it&rsquo;s not that I <i>eat </i>the swords or whatever, they just get&hellip;y&rsquo;know&hellip;consumed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Still goes into you first.&rdquo; Molly\ndigs a fleck of something out of the setting around what might be an emerald. &ldquo;But,\nas someone who has had a blade in his chest, I can see why you wouldn&rsquo;t want to\nstick any more in there.&rdquo;</p><p>Whatever frustration or focus\netched the lines in Fjord&rsquo;s face, it quickly melts to melancholy and guilt. &ldquo;Molly,\nI&rsquo;m so sorry that happened to you. You didn&rsquo;t have to. The rest of you should\nhave left us behind.&rdquo;</p><p>Molly rolls his eyes. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not\nhaving this discussion again. Of <i>course </i>we\nwere always going to come after you. Doesn&rsquo;t matter if Tiamat herself took you,\nyou&rsquo;re our friends. <i>You </i>are <i>my </i>friend. If there&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;ve\nlearned in my short time it&rsquo;s that you don&rsquo;t abandon someone when they&rsquo;re in\ntrouble, especially an ally.&rdquo;</p><p>Fjord half-smiles. He hasn&rsquo;t looked\nat Molly this whole time. &ldquo;Thank you. I hope one day I can deserve that sort of\nfriendship.&rdquo;</p><p>Molly playfully slaps Fjord with\nhis tail. &ldquo;Like I said, we&rsquo;re not talking about that.&rdquo; He rests his elbow\nagainst his knee and props his chin against his fist. &ldquo;Do you need a hug?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s too quick of a response.\nDespite the finality in his tone, Fjord darts his eyes towards Molly long\nenough to give reasonable doubt.</p><p>Molly grins. &ldquo;Do you <i>want </i>a hug?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&mdash; Thank you, but&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;But what?&rdquo;</p><p>Fjord grits his teeth. &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean, &lsquo;What for?&rsquo; For\ngods&rsquo; sakes, it&rsquo;s a hug. You hug the people you like when they need a reminder\nthat someone cares about them. Or because one or both of you wants it. So, do\nyou want &mdash; and/or need &mdash; a hug?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You promise it&mdash;&rdquo; Fjord clears his\nthroat. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a hug, right? Not like&hellip;like&hellip;&rdquo; He mimes something that\nreminds Molly of his moment with Caduceus. He&rsquo;s trying so hard not to blush and\nfailing so spectacularly that Molly can&rsquo;t help but laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;No surprises, I promise. I wasn&rsquo;t\nlying about having pants on, was I?&rdquo; Molly gets to his feet and holds out his\narms. &ldquo;Get over here, sailor.&rdquo;</p><p>With some hesitation, Fjord sets\ndown the falchion so he can push himself up. He takes a few awkward steps in\nMolly&rsquo;s direction.</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh, I swear you can be worse than\nBeau and Caleb combined.&rdquo; Molly beckons with his hands still outstretched. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll\nbe over soon and you&rsquo;ll feel better afterwards. C&rsquo;mon.&rdquo;</p><p>Fjord finally walks into the hug\nwith his arms slumped forward to sort of hold Molly by his sides. Molly puts\none arm around Fjord&rsquo;s waist and uses the other to pat Fjord on the back.\nThough he doesn&rsquo;t want to be too sappy, Molly also tries to convey through the\npressure and positioning of his hug that he does genuinely care. He cares that\nFjord is on edge now that he&rsquo;s close to learning more about his powers. He\ncares that Fjord has been more distant and quiet since the Nest. He cares about\nFjord in general, the way he cares about everyone else, yet in the way Fjord\nneeds to be cared about. Theirs is a band of orphans and outcasts. <i>Someone </i>has to care.</p><p>The door opens. &ldquo;Oh. Am I uh,\ninterrupting something?&rdquo; Caduceus dips his head to see under the doorframe. &ldquo;I\ncan come back later if you two were having a discussion or something.&rdquo;</p><p>Fjord was out of Molly&rsquo;s arms the\ninstant the handle turned. Shame. He had been relaxing into the hug and Molly\nwasn&rsquo;t done yet. Fjord straightens himself to address Caduceus. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re fine,\nCaduceus. Was there anythin&rsquo; you needed?&rdquo;</p><p>Caduceus ducks into the room. The\nceilings of the Lavish Chateau are high enough for him to walk around\ncomfortably. The doors, not so much. &ldquo;I was in the mood for some tea but the\nkind I want is in my bag. Would you two like to join me? Castala family. Good people,\ngood tea.&rdquo;</p><p>Molly remembers that tea. A mug of\nit was put in his hands shortly after his resurrection. First there had been\nCaduceus&rsquo;s face, pale as mist with a cascade of pink tumbling down towards him.\nThen a wave of some glowing crystal on the end of a staff which made all the\nnerves in Molly&rsquo;s body tingle, like it was rapidly removing the fatigue after\nwaking up from a deep sleep. His friends were there, plus Nila the firbolg, and\nas soon as Molly sat up he was almost knocked down again by an exuberant Nott.\nCaleb had told her to let Molly have space to breathe. That was when Caduceus\ngave him the tea. The very first word Molly said was &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; It was far\nbetter than &ldquo;Empty&rdquo; and at least he could remember everything. Almost\neverything.</p><p>Fjord politely declines the tea. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll\ntake some,&rdquo; Molly says. &ldquo;After all, if you&rsquo;re getting your kettle out and\neverything, better to do it for more than just yourself, eh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, they have the hot water\ndownstairs, but I sampled some of their tea leaves and I prefer my own.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; Fjord says. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t think\nthey served tea here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s why their selection\nis so poor,&rdquo; Caduceus says. &ldquo;No one ever asks for it.&rdquo; He has that smile on his\nface. It looks permanent, as though it&rsquo;s just the way his face always was and\nalways will go back to when he&rsquo;s at rest. Even a few times when Molly has been\nup for the night watch he has seen Caduceus smile like that in his sleep. Other\ntimes, though&hellip; And in those deep eyes Molly can see the way he&rsquo;s looking at the\ntwo of them. Not angry. Not worried. Just observing. One day Molly will\nunderstand this firbolg. Maybe.</p><p>Molly puts on his own smile. &ldquo;Well,\nbest not let that hot water wait any longer. Let&rsquo;s go. You coming, Fjord? You\ndon&rsquo;t need to drink, but it&rsquo;s company if you want it.&rdquo;</p><p>Fjord glances down at his falchion.\n&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ll stay here, but thanks.&rdquo; To Caduceus he says, &ldquo;Quick question.&rdquo;</p><p>Caduceus tilts his head. &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think swords, uh, feel\nbetter after you polish them?&rdquo;</p><p>Caduceus thinks for a moment. &ldquo;My\nstaff shines brighter when I polish it. The wood appreciates being taken care\nof, too. I don&rsquo;t know about swords though, especially ones like yours. Whoever\ngave it to you might like that you&rsquo;re taking care of it.&rdquo;</p><p>Fjord freezes up for a heartbeat. &ldquo;I&hellip;never\nthought of that. Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome.&rdquo; Caduceus\nretrieves the small packet of tea from amongst his belongings. Molly follows\nhim out of the room with a quick check over his shoulder. Fjord is quickly\nsettling back onto the floor and reaching for the whetstone.</p><p>Molly worries about Fjord\nsometimes. Fjord has endeavored time and time again to be the team&rsquo;s moral anchor,\nbut it&rsquo;s not easy. Not only is the Mighty Nein comprised of orphans and\noutcasts, but each of them is broken in some way, searching for the missing\npiece to make them whole again. Sometimes the search for those pieces makes\nthem do desperate things, keep dark secrets, act on dangerous impulses. When\nthe Iron Shepherds broke their team in half, Molly had put his life on the line\nput it back together. Even when they were reunited, a few new chips had broken off.\nNow Molly isn&rsquo;t sure what lengths Fjord will go to in order to keep himself\nfrom breaking further, or if his methods won&rsquo;t shatter him in the end.</p>",
