        "body": "<p>So, here is another chapter on the battle at Winterfell. Bran\u2019s PoV. We do not catch up yet to the end of the Da\u20acnerys\u2019 chapter, but we\u2019ll reach that at the end of the next chapter. Also on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/8470255/chapters/43444991\">AO3</a>.</p><p>Bran could\nhear their voices all the time now. It made it difficult to concentrate on what\npeople said. The voices of the children drowned everything out. Their voices\nwere the pulse of the earth in autumn, a slight breeze in summer, the steady\ndropping of a spring rain. They were insistent, urging him. He concentrated on\nthe plan to trap the White Walkers. He dared not think beyond that. They did\nnot understand that he would think about his family, not when they were so\nclose to the thin veil that separated them from the access to their magic. He\ncould hide his thoughts behind his worry for his family. In a way it was an\nadvantage that they were all in danger.</p><!-- more --><p>He didn\u2019t\nneed to touch the weirwood any longer, and it would be a risk anyway. Bran\ndoubted he could hide anything from them if he opened his thoughts again to the\nweirwood. He had not even dared to take the arrows from the tree. The children\nhad reached out and hid Bran and Theon from the White Walkers. The enemy would\nnot sense them, not as long as there was a feast of living souls they could expect\nto drain as soon as they had won the castle. </p><p>Bran let\nhis mind wander, seeing, but not acting. The time for action would come later, for\nnow the pieces were all set. He wondered if his siblings would think him cold.\nA part of him knew that they would not appreciate to be moved like pieces on a\ncyvasse board, but that was as far as his understanding went. He knew that they\nprobably would be angry with him, but he did not feel it, nor did he dread\ntheir hurt.</p><p><b><i>Brienne and Jaime were\nfighting in a steady and constant rhythm, as if they were one person, sensing\nthe other\u2019s weakness, raising their swords to help the other. </i></b></p><p><b><i>Arya was a small\nwhirlwind. Needle was everywhere, and although Gendry and her did not complement\neach other as well as Brienne and Jaime, they easily held their own. Bran saw\nthe Unsullied edging closer to Gendry, the fighting was thick, but this was up\nto Arya.</i></b></p><p>Theon\u2019s\ntouch brought him back into his own body. </p><p>\u201cBran,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cI thought about this. I don\u2019t claim to understand everything, but I do\nthink there is a flaw in your argument. You say it is all about balance, but if\nwe can restore balance by destroying the White Walkers with wildfire and then killing\nthe dragons, why can\u2019t we do it, the other way round? Kill the dragons and then\nthe fire magic is gone, and then White Walkers will die as well.\u201d</p><p>Bran shook\nhis head. <i>We could have done that, if\nDaenerys had let us. But she would not give up her dragons.</i> He would have\nto come up with something that would appease Theon and the voices in his head.</p><p>\u201cIf the\nWhite Walkers are killed first, the Children regain their strength and only\nthen the arrows will be strong enough to kill the dragons. It is crucial that\nthe scales first tip in favour of fire. It is the ice magic that channels the\nstrength away from the Children.\u201d</p><p>The voices\nin his head were satisfied.

                "content": "<p>So, here is another chapter on the battle at Winterfell. Bran&rsquo;s PoV. We do not catch up yet to the end of the Da&euro;nerys&rsquo; chapter, but we&rsquo;ll reach that at the end of the next chapter. Also on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/8470255/chapters/43444991\">AO3</a>.</p><p>Bran could\nhear their voices all the time now. It made it difficult to concentrate on what\npeople said. The voices of the children drowned everything out. Their voices\nwere the pulse of the earth in autumn, a slight breeze in summer, the steady\ndropping of a spring rain. They were insistent, urging him. He concentrated on\nthe plan to trap the White Walkers. He dared not think beyond that. They did\nnot understand that he would think about his family, not when they were so\nclose to the thin veil that separated them from the access to their magic. He\ncould hide his thoughts behind his worry for his family. In a way it was an\nadvantage that they were all in danger.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t\nneed to touch the weirwood any longer, and it would be a risk anyway. Bran\ndoubted he could hide anything from them if he opened his thoughts again to the\nweirwood. He had not even dared to take the arrows from the tree. The children\nhad reached out and hid Bran and Theon from the White Walkers. The enemy would\nnot sense them, not as long as there was a feast of living souls they could expect\nto drain as soon as they had won the castle. </p><p>Bran let\nhis mind wander, seeing, but not acting. The time for action would come later, for\nnow the pieces were all set. He wondered if his siblings would think him cold.\nA part of him knew that they would not appreciate to be moved like pieces on a\ncyvasse board, but that was as far as his understanding went. He knew that they\nprobably would be angry with him, but he did not feel it, nor did he dread\ntheir hurt.</p><p><b><i>Brienne and Jaime were\nfighting in a steady and constant rhythm, as if they were one person, sensing\nthe other&rsquo;s weakness, raising their swords to help the other. </i></b></p><p><b><i>Arya was a small\nwhirlwind. Needle was everywhere, and although Gendry and her did not complement\neach other as well as Brienne and Jaime, they easily held their own. Bran saw\nthe Unsullied edging closer to Gendry, the fighting was thick, but this was up\nto Arya.</i></b></p><p>Theon&rsquo;s\ntouch brought him back into his own body. </p><p>&ldquo;Bran,&rdquo; he\nsaid. &ldquo;I thought about this. I don&rsquo;t claim to understand everything, but I do\nthink there is a flaw in your argument. You say it is all about balance, but if\nwe can restore balance by destroying the White Walkers with wildfire and then killing\nthe dragons, why can&rsquo;t we do it, the other way round? Kill the dragons and then\nthe fire magic is gone, and then White Walkers will die as well.&rdquo;</p><p>Bran shook\nhis head. <i>We could have done that, if\nDaenerys had let us. But she would not give up her dragons.</i> He would have\nto come up with something that would appease Theon and the voices in his head.</p><p>&ldquo;If the\nWhite Walkers are killed first, the Children regain their strength and only\nthen the arrows will be strong enough to kill the dragons. It is crucial that\nthe scales first tip in favour of fire. It is the ice magic that channels the\nstrength away from the Children.&rdquo;</p><p>The voices\nin his head were satisfied. Bran could feel their pressure in his head lessen\nfor a moment, and he heard something that felt like the far away echo of a\nchuckle. Quickly, he distracted himself from the sound. It would be no good if\nthey realised that he knew they were manipulating him.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell\nyou when to act. I just have to check on Jon.&rdquo;</p><p>Before he\nconcentrated on the battle again, he saw worry cast a shadow on Theon&rsquo;s face.\nHe knew he probably looked creepy when he delved into his visions, but that was\nnot to be helped.</p><p>Bran\nchecked on Rhaegal. It was interesting how the wall of earth magic he and Jon\nhad built around his mind had changed the dragon. His contained fire was less\ndangerous, more focussed than Drogon&rsquo;s, but it was still fire. <i>Fire made flesh.</i> Bran briefly touched\nJon&rsquo;s mind reassuringly. He wondered if he should have told his cousin to not\ngrow too attached to the beast.</p><p><b><i>Sansa was leading the everybody\ndown into the crypts. Bran could feel the tiny, tiny fleck of a being close to\nher heart, and he brushed his nephew ever so lightly. Olyvar Frey was at\nSansa&rsquo;s side, his eyes restive and Ghost flanked her on the other side. Bran\ncould feel that Sansa was frightened, but he was sure nobody would realise\nthat. She calmly managed the constant stream of people. </i></b></p><p>It was time\nnow. The enemy was closing in, claiming the castle. Bran knew that there was no\nchance he could close of the crypts with everybody on the inside. </p><p><b><i>Arya and Gendry were\nat the rearguard. They might be cut off.</i></b></p><p>He knew he\nshould be sad about this, but he had no tears. <i>Maybe I will have tears later, when this is all over. </i>That was a\ndangerous thought, he could feel the resentment and lack of understanding from the\nChildren about his yearning for tears. He stamped on his worry for Arya. He had\nseen that she had a decent chance of survival after all.</p><p><b><i>Sansa led the living\ndeeper and deeper into the tunnels. Brienne and Jaime were at the end of the\ncolumn. Tyrion chose this moment to finally unburden his conscience. He had\nbeen in the middle of the column, but now he ran back and looked for his\nbrother, his stride was unsteady. He must have drunk many tankards to be that\naffected. </i></b></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Jaime,&rdquo; he called,\n&ldquo;Jaime.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><b><i>His brother barely\nmanaged to save him from being killed by a White Walker when he buried his\nValyrian sword in the White Walker mere moments before he touched Tyrion.</i></b></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;What are you doing\nhere?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>Bran\nwaited. He should call the Kings of Winter now and he could feel the Children\npressuring him. He stood his ground.</p><p><i>I don&rsquo;t want them to die. I don&rsquo;t want anyone\nto die. Go, now, leave this room, he tried to tell them.</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Sansa, I think she is\nin danger.&rdquo; Tyrion blurted out. There were tears in his eyes. &ldquo;I should have\ntold you earlier. I think Daenerys might have bribed someone to kill her.&rdquo; </i></b></p><p><b><i>Jaime pushed his\nbrother. &ldquo;Get yourself to safety. And don&rsquo;t you worry.
