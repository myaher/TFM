He sighs and settles back into his pillow with a petulant frown, drawing the duvet up under his chin. His eyes begin to droop again and just as he is about to doze off, a soft voice calls his name from the other side of the room. Loki groans and blinks in the direction the voice came from, relaxing when he spots Tony poking his head in through their bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cHow ya doin\u2019, Lokes?\u201d</p><p>As Tony pushes his way into the room, careful of the tinkling tray in his hands, Loki shrugs, keen to appear unruffled by the illness but the motion causes a tickle in his throat and he covers his mouth with his arm as he hacks up a lung. It is a few moments more before Loki regains his breath, but there is a significant wheezing quality to it that sets Tony on edge. And, as he draws closer to their bed, Tony\u2019s gaze is immediately drawn to the dark circles under Loki\u2019s eyes, then to the pale sallowness of his cheeks, conscious that the healthier flush they had earlier that morning has now faded. Tony worries his bottom lip between his teeth. \u201cYou really are down in the dumps, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Loki makes no answer and instead sniffles again, eyes drifting down to the tray in Tony\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cOh, um, yeah, I made you chicken noodle soup. Or, well, JARVIS ordered some since I can\u2019t cook, but you know that already\u2026\u201d Despite his obvious fatigue, Tony can clearly see amusement light up Loki\u2019s eyes, so he continues to ramble as he sits next to Loki\u2019s side. \u201cChicken soup is really good for the soul, you know. There was a book about it and everything. And it really does help.\u201d He helps Loki sit up before setting the tray on his lap. \u201cNow, kinda lean over it. Yeah, just like that. And breathe in the steam, uh-huh. JARVIS said that can help loosen things up, and maybe help speed up the getting better process just a little bit.\u201d Tony rubs gentle circles on the back of Loki\u2019s hand but starts as Loki pulls his hand away to pick up the spoon. \u201cNeed help?\u201d</p><p>Loki shakes his head with a weak laugh, but, again, it becomes clear that help is definitely needed as more soup ends up spilled on the tray than stays in the spoon. It is clear that Loki is frustrated so Tony silently shifts closer and wraps his fingers around Loki\u2019s trembling hand, gently guiding the spoon from the bowl to Loki\u2019s mouth. He grins as Loki takes his first sip, a sigh escaping him. </p><p>\u201cGood?\u201d</p><p>Loki nods. </p><p>Tony spends the next ten minutes feeding Loki, warmth blooming in his chest as he watches Loki struggle to keep his eyes open long enough to finish his soup, but he finally manages it. Tony sets the tray on the nightstand, nudging Loki\u2019s tissues to the side, and turns back to help Loki lie back down. He makes sure Loki is completely settled before bending down to kiss his forehead. \u201cGet some rest, love, and I\u2019ll have tea prepared for when you wake up.\u201d He grins as Loki nods, his eyes already drooping, and Tony can\u2019t resist kissing him once more before standing to tuck the covers around him. </p><p>Flicking the lights off, Tony backs out of the room and closes the door on Loki\u2019s soft snores.</p><hr><p>Miss the more dragon side of Tony?

                "content": "<p>Loki tosses another tissue onto his nightstand with a pathetic sniffle, adding to the ever-growing pile. Stupid Midgard with their stupid<i></i>diseases. He sighs and settles back into his pillow with a petulant frown, drawing the duvet up under his chin. His eyes begin to droop again and just as he is about to doze off, a soft voice calls his name from the other side of the room. Loki groans and blinks in the direction the voice came from, relaxing when he spots Tony poking his head in through their bedroom door.</p><p>&ldquo;How ya doin&rsquo;, Lokes?&rdquo;</p><p>As Tony pushes his way into the room, careful of the tinkling tray in his hands, Loki shrugs, keen to appear unruffled by the illness but the motion causes a tickle in his throat and he covers his mouth with his arm as he hacks up a lung. It is a few moments more before Loki regains his breath, but there is a significant wheezing quality to it that sets Tony on edge. And, as he draws closer to their bed, Tony&rsquo;s gaze is immediately drawn to the dark circles under Loki&rsquo;s eyes, then to the pale sallowness of his cheeks, conscious that the healthier flush they had earlier that morning has now faded. Tony worries his bottom lip between his teeth. &ldquo;You really are down in the dumps, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>Loki makes no answer and instead sniffles again, eyes drifting down to the tray in Tony&rsquo;s hands.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, um, yeah, I made you chicken noodle soup. Or, well, JARVIS ordered some since I can&rsquo;t cook, but you know that already&hellip;&rdquo; Despite his obvious fatigue, Tony can clearly see amusement light up Loki&rsquo;s eyes, so he continues to ramble as he sits next to Loki&rsquo;s side. &ldquo;Chicken soup is really good for the soul, you know. There was a book about it and everything. And it really does help.&rdquo; He helps Loki sit up before setting the tray on his lap. &ldquo;Now, kinda lean over it. Yeah, just like that. And breathe in the steam, uh-huh. JARVIS said that can help loosen things up, and maybe help speed up the getting better process just a little bit.&rdquo; Tony rubs gentle circles on the back of Loki&rsquo;s hand but starts as Loki pulls his hand away to pick up the spoon. &ldquo;Need help?&rdquo;</p><p>Loki shakes his head with a weak laugh, but, again, it becomes clear that help is definitely needed as more soup ends up spilled on the tray than stays in the spoon. It is clear that Loki is frustrated so Tony silently shifts closer and wraps his fingers around Loki&rsquo;s trembling hand, gently guiding the spoon from the bowl to Loki&rsquo;s mouth. He grins as Loki takes his first sip, a sigh escaping him. </p><p>&ldquo;Good?&rdquo;</p><p>Loki nods. </p><p>Tony spends the next ten minutes feeding Loki, warmth blooming in his chest as he watches Loki struggle to keep his eyes open long enough to finish his soup, but he finally manages it. Tony sets the tray on the nightstand, nudging Loki&rsquo;s tissues to the side, and turns back to help Loki lie back down. He makes sure Loki is completely settled before bending down to kiss his forehead. &ldquo;Get some rest, love, and I&rsquo;ll have tea prepared for when you wake up.&rdquo; He grins as Loki nods, his eyes already drooping, and Tony can&rsquo;t resist kissing him once more before standing to tuck the covers around him. </p><p>Flicking the lights off, Tony backs out of the room and closes the door on Loki&rsquo;s soft snores.</p><hr /><p>Miss the more dragon side of Tony?
