She later said she got to do everything she wanted to do for Arya in S8 and exhausted every aspect of her character. Maisie had to rewatch S1 and she plotted out the beginning, middle and end of Arya\u2019s S8 storyline \u2013 so it seems she has much to do! Maisie admitted as much when she was on Jimmy Kimmel and then again in her more recent Guardian interview saying<b> she had more to do in S8 than any prior season of Game of Thrones. That\u2019s very telling! </b></p><p>Plus, the more keen observers who noted how closely inline Kit and Maisie\u2019s filming schedules were this year, with those two filming the most consistently since Nov 2017 to July 2018, wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Arya/Jon have an even stronger bond than *some* people are dreading. According to WoTW new article: \u00a0</p><blockquote><b>\n\u201cThey spent 10 months filming six episodes of television, which would normally take about two months. That\u2019s pretty crazy. And a lot of that wasn\u2019t the big battle stuff, but the regular scenes of two people talking in a hallway,\u201d he clarifies&quot;</b>.\u00a0- James Hibberd, Entertainment Weekly writer. He visited the S8 set twice during filming. According to his IG, he was on the S8 set in Belfast: Moneyglass location (The huge Winterfell set) early March. He also saw a very important E6 scene being filmed and he was shocked at who was still there by the end of the season. I\u2019ll talk more about this in a new post!\n</blockquote><p>Arya avenged the Red Wedding in S6/S7 and I think she would take the threat of the NK and the Army of the Dead far more seriously right now (over some politics) and understand where Jon is coming from. Not once have the writers ever shown Arya doubt Jon leading up to their long awaited reunion. If that was their plan, in S7 at least, the writers would have introduced some hint of Arya questioning Jon\u2019s motives or even have her see Sansa\u2019s POV with some merit. Arya has never done that and I doubt she\u2019ll start in S8. In fact, the opposite has happened with Arya *supporting* Jon while the rest of the Lords/Sansa continued to doubt him.</p><p>Sansa knows for a fact (as all the viewers do) that Arya would always choose Jon.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>Hey, nonnie!</p><p>You know this is a very interesting question because we, in the Jonsa fandom, have been debating for a while just how Jon and Arya\u2019s relationship will develop in season 8 and I know it\u2019s a sore point for many Arya fans that Jonsas think Arya and Jon\u2019s reunion will not go as smoothly as people imagine.\u00a0</p><p>But I\u2019d like to put this in context a little so people don\u2019t misinterpret what I\u2019m saying. Arya, out of all the Stark children, was the one that was exposed the most to the devastation of the War of the Five Kings. That\u2019s not to say the others didn\u2019t endure harrowing experiences. All of them have been through hell and this is not a competition of who suffered most. But by virtue of either being in King\u2019s Landing, at the Wall or beyond the Wall, Sansa, Jon and Bran have been isolated from Robb\u2019s rebellion or what that meant for the 7 kingdoms as a whole.\u00a0</p><p>Arya was in the midst of it. Since her father\u2019s death until she ultimately decides to go to Braavos, Arya has been trying to get back home, to Winterfell. She is the only one out of all of them to witness the Red Wedding. She was there and watched as Robb\u2019s men were killed, saw his direwolf being slaughtered and had to stand by while the Freys sowed Grey Wind\u2019s head onto Robb\u2019s body and paraded it around. To say that she would now be A-OK with Jon bending the knee to a stranger with dragons and a gang of violent savages and essentially giving up his ancestral home (one she\u2019s been struggling to get back to since s1) and the North that her oldest brother died fighting for, is both ignoring her experiences as well as insulting her intelligence. So no, I don\u2019t think Arya would be OK with Jon doing that. She loves Jon very, very much and, of course, she wants him to be happy but one thing doesn\u2019t excuse the other.\u00a0</p><p>Now, as for how it will play out, I tend to go back and forth between 2 scenarios:\u00a0</p><p>1. Arya will simply reject what Jon has done and become antagonistic towards him from the start - this is mainly based on her impulsive nature. I don\u2019t think this is very likely because, like I said, she loves him very much and while she\u2019s been traumatized and has become\u00a0\u201ca bit of a monster\u201d (Maisie\u2019s words), I don\u2019t think she\u2019d ever threaten to cut off Jon\u2019s face as she did with Sansa. It pains me to say it but I don\u2019t think showArya, at least, loves showSansa that much (or vice versa to be honest). They\u2019ve reach a point of comfort at the end of s7 and I hope their relationship develops positively in s8 but, at this point, it is what it is. Jon is different because, out of all of her family, Arya loves him the most. He\u2019s the only reason why she even gave up her list and came back to Winterfell. Which brings me to the 2nd scenario \u2026</p><p>2. Arya will try to understand Jon\u2019s reasoning for doing what he did but ultimately won\u2019t be able to which will cause a rift between the two of them. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any scenario in which Arya will warm up to D*ny, no matter how pretty or how cool she looks atop her dragons. D*ny is a threat to Winterfell and the pack and I doubt Arya would be happy to stand by and let her take away what the Starks have died and bled for. I think she\u2019d ultimately think Jon stupid for doing what he did.\u00a0</p><p>This is one of the many reasons, btw, why I\u2019m so invested in pol!Jon. Aside from the narrative and thematic importance of Jon not committing the mistakes of the other Starks that went South, in the absence of a political motivation, Jon is putting at risk all of the most important relationships in his life: his relationship with Arya, his relationship with Sansa, his relationship with the North that he calls home and where he was finally accepted after feeling rejected all his life. I really don\u2019t want him to lose all of that just so he can have subpar s*x with the dragon lady.\u00a0</p><p>As for your other question, yes, I do think Arya will steal another face in season 8. I don\u2019t think her Faceless Men arc is over. To me, the FM are the Hotel California of Game of Thrones:\u00a0\u201cYou can check out anytime you want but you can never leave\u201d. So she will be drawn back into it and she will end up killing someone and taking their face.\u00a0</p><p>As for whom \u2026 That\u2019s more difficult to answer because, aside from Walder Frey, we haven\u2019t seen Arya steal a face of any importance. I would imagine that it would have to be someone from her list because as much as she might want to give it up at some point (my head canon is that Jon will try to steer her away from the list because he won\u2019t be able to bare seeing his little sister become a psychopathic murderer), she will find herself in the position where she won\u2019t be able to resist, for whatever reason. If I were to pick it would probably be the Hound. She refused to kill him once, she might have to go through with it in the end even if she doesn\u2019t want to, which would be a nice twist on the idea of revenge and her list.\u00a0</p>",

Arya will try to understand Jon&rsquo;s reasoning for doing what he did but ultimately won&rsquo;t be able to which will cause a rift between the two of them. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any scenario in which Arya will warm up to D*ny, no matter how pretty or how cool she looks atop her dragons. D*ny is a threat to Winterfell and the pack and I doubt Arya would be happy to stand by and let her take away what the Starks have died and bled for. I think she&rsquo;d ultimately think Jon stupid for doing what he did.&nbsp;</p><p>This is one of the many reasons, btw, why I&rsquo;m so invested in pol!Jon. Aside from the narrative and thematic importance of Jon not committing the mistakes of the other Starks that went South, in the absence of a political motivation, Jon is putting at risk all of the most important relationships in his life: his relationship with Arya, his relationship with Sansa, his relationship with the North that he calls home and where he was finally accepted after feeling rejected all his life. I really don&rsquo;t want him to lose all of that just so he can have subpar s*x with the dragon lady.&nbsp;</p><p>As for your other question, yes, I do think Arya will steal another face in season 8. I don&rsquo;t think her Faceless Men arc is over. To me, the FM are the Hotel California of Game of Thrones:&nbsp;&ldquo;You can check out anytime you want but you can never leave&rdquo;. So she will be drawn back into it and she will end up killing someone and taking their face.&nbsp;</p><p>As for whom &hellip; That&rsquo;s more difficult to answer because, aside from Walder Frey, we haven&rsquo;t seen Arya steal a face of any importance. I would imagine that it would have to be someone from her list because as much as she might want to give it up at some point (my head canon is that Jon will try to steer her away from the list because he won&rsquo;t be able to bare seeing his little sister become a psychopathic murderer), she will find herself in the position where she won&rsquo;t be able to resist, for whatever reason. If I were to pick it would probably be the Hound. She refused to kill him once, she might have to go through with it in the end even if she doesn&rsquo;t want to, which would be a nice twist on the idea of revenge and her list.&nbsp;</p>",
