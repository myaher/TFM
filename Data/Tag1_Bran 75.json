D's said she'd burn anyone who betrayed her(varys for now but I'm sure it extends to anyone in her circle) I thought for a while now when Tyrion can't control D's impulsive decisions, he'll hopefully leave her but I think also he might justify D till the very end... I think it's very unlikely all the Lannisters survive.",
        "answer": "<p>Hi, thank you very much for your message. In my opinion, Tyrion\u2019s arc will be one of the most interesting arcs in season 8.\u00a0</p><h2>His trilemma</h2><p>He will find himself struggle between various missions (or priorities): his duty to Dany, Jaime, Cersei (and the child she bears, since I believe he promised her to protect her child), or the realm. At some point, he will have to choose what should be his highest priority.\u00a0</p><p>As Peter Dinklage has said:\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s trying to figure out who he really is in this <b>storm of negotiations</b>.\u201d (<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Few.com%2Ftv%2Fgame-of-thrones-cast-photos-season-8%2F%3Fslide%3D6218450%236218450&amp;t=ZDhlNTM0M2ZiNjIyOGRhN2RmOTU0MGEyZWQ4N2I4MTRiMzNkMDFlNyxOWklONW55ZA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AaXNGUUplLruDKaOiwjtU5A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fspringwolvesofwinterfell.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183989590974%2Fspringwolvesofwinterfell-will-the-time-of&amp;m=1\">Peter Dinklage on Tyrion in S8, EW</a>), Tyrion must first identify who he is: the Hand to Queen Daenerys, a Lannister, or a man who serves the realm. Once he figures out who he should be, the choice will be easier.\u00a0</p><p>Since Jaime would definitely choose to do the right thing (fighting for the living), that would be a decisive factor to sway Tyrion to the Starks\u2019 side, if Dany abandons the fight for the living prematurely. It\u2019s independent of the news about Jon\u2019s parentage. I guess once Jaime arrives in WF, he will have a private chat with Tyrion, in which Tyrion knows that Cersei cheats. So, to protect his siblings, \u00a0he will <a href=\"https://springwolvesofwinterfell.tumblr.com/post/184066658575/springwolvesofwinterfell-the-consequences-of\">cover such news from Dany</a>, knowing that she is not tolerant and would harshly punish both Cersei and Jaime (and even Tyrion himself) if she knows. He might even secretly make a deal with the Starks in case Dany turns on them.\u00a0</p><p>However, sooner or later, Dany will realize that the Lannister duo hide the news from her. Coupling with Jon\u2019s parentage (I don\u2019t know how they would reveal the news to the public yet, but it will be absolutely dramatic), Dany will be on fire. My bet is she\u2019s setting WF on fire before she leaves.\u00a0</p><p>At this point, I think Tyrion would firmly choose his brother over Dany. He will stay with Jaime in WF. Now he knows that Dany will go South to punish Cersei, his next mission is <a href=\"https://springwolvesofwinterfell.tumblr.com/post/183989590974/springwolvesofwinterfell-will-the-time-of\">secure an alliance with the Starks for Cersei</a> to save her arse. His role has always been a negotiator.</p><h2>What does true love mean?</h2><p>To add more complication to the mix, I believe, at some point, Tyrion will fall in love with Sansa. And his affection for her could be a decisive factor, that moves him for better (or worse?). We will have to wait to see how it turns out.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"592\" data-orig-height=\"333\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5532278c9da83cf442dac81241c80e39/tumblr_inline_ppxz065iDv1v86ltz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"592\" data-orig-height=\"333\"/></figure><p>About his fate, in my opinion, Tyrion\u2019s fate was sealed the moment he cursed the whole King\u2019s Landing and killed his father. He will see with his own eyes how his curse becomes real, under the hand of his once beloved Queen, the one he helped bring to Westeros. That would be a very very tragic moment for Tyrion. <b>He would not able to forgive himself for wishing such horrible fate for people of this city</b>, and now it is a reality, a reality he helped to forge. In some sense, he has become the monster everyone thinks he is.\u00a0<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0160954ef53b5dfd6854a894988dffad/tumblr_inline_ppxzj02Ctb1v86ltz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"900\" data-orig-height=\"600\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/069419612176007f8c1548c77c62fe13/tumblr_inline_ppxznqxt9Q1v86ltz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"900\" data-orig-height=\"600\"/></figure><p>Would Tyrion redeem himself? I think, he would. All his life, Tyrion has been <b>seeking love, acceptance and recognition</b>, from his family and from other people. But he never knows what true love is, except the brotherly love with Jaime. All he\u2019s ever known was politics, money matters and whoring.\u00a0His relationship with Shae was lust and possession. With Dany, it was a mixture of adoration, fear, the thirst for revenge on Cersei (now he realizes how wrong he was to wish so), and the hope to have his place in building a new world (he will also realize he chooses the wrong person to put this hope on). To make his arc full circle, <a href=\"https://springwolvesofwinterfell.tumblr.com/post/184008677819/springwolvesofwinterfell\">he will in the end understand what love truly means</a>. <b>Why I believe true love will matter for Tyrion?</b> Because of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miG9zMFyTEc\">this converstion from season 2 with Cersei</a>. It was moment after Myrcella\u2019s departure for Dorne (due to a betrothal Tyrion arranged for her) and before the riot in KL (when Sansa was nearly raped and Tyrion was panicked that they lost her.)</p><figure data-orig-width=\"932\" data-orig-height=\"521\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/766ca151dce5c481d71df049a0476772/tumblr_inline_ppxzwf0Csb1v86ltz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"932\" data-orig-height=\"521\"/></figure><blockquote><p>One day I pray you love someone. I pray that you love her so much. When you close your eyes, you\u2019ll see her face, you\u2019ll know what it feels, you\u2019ll know what is like to love someone, <b>to truly love someone. Before I take her from you.</b>\u00a0(Cersei to Tyrion, 2x06)<br/></p></blockquote><p>Interestingly, the camera panned to Sansa after Tyrion left the scene.</p><p>Throughout season 2, 3 and the beginning of season 4, they\u2019ve already planted the seed of romance between Tyrion and Sansa (\u2019though one-sided). So what would mean for Tyrion if he realizes that he truly loves someone? Sadly for him, that person might not love him back. What would he do?\u00a0</p><h2>To love is to sacrifce</h2><p>As Peter Dinklage has said about the Tyrion\u2019s arc, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnet.com%2Fnews%2Fgame-of-thrones-ends-beautifully-for-tyrion-peter-dinklage-says%2F&amp;t=Zjk1OTM2NDgyNDI2MGIwNDM1ZWY1YWMxYjY3Y2QwN2FlZGJlZjk5OCxOWklONW55ZA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AaXNGUUplLruDKaOiwjtU5A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fspringwolvesofwinterfell.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F184008677819%2Fspringwolvesofwinterfell&amp;m=1\">\u201cIt <b>ends beautifully</b> for my character <b>whether it be tragic or not</b>.</a>\u201d, so a tragic end is almost guaranteed. But it will be a beautiful end,\u00a0we will lose lots of tears over the departure of his character. And I think, all of us could be happy for him, if in the last days of his life, Tyrion would understand what it means to truly love someone. Maybe he would never get anything in return, but at least such love brings him a little joy. That\u2019s the sweet part of love. The bitter part? To love someone truly sometimes means that you have to sacrifice yourself so that the one you love would be safe.

            "comment": "<p>Hi, thank you very much for your message. In my opinion, Tyrion\u2019s arc will be one of the most interesting arcs in season 8.\u00a0</p><h2>His trilemma</h2><p>He will find himself struggle between various missions (or priorities): his duty to Dany, Jaime, Cersei (and the child she bears, since I believe he promised her to protect her child), or the realm. At some point, he will have to choose what should be his highest priority.\u00a0</p><p>As Peter Dinklage has said:\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s trying to figure out who he really is in this <b>storm of negotiations</b>.\u201d (<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Few.com%2Ftv%2Fgame-of-thrones-cast-photos-season-8%2F%3Fslide%3D6218450%236218450&amp;t=ZDhlNTM0M2ZiNjIyOGRhN2RmOTU0MGEyZWQ4N2I4MTRiMzNkMDFlNyxOWklONW55ZA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AaXNGUUplLruDKaOiwjtU5A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fspringwolvesofwinterfell.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183989590974%2Fspringwolvesofwinterfell-will-the-time-of&amp;m=1\">Peter Dinklage on Tyrion in S8, EW</a>), Tyrion must first identify who he is: the Hand to Queen Daenerys, a Lannister, or a man who serves the realm. Once he figures out who he should be, the choice will be easier.\u00a0</p><p>Since Jaime would definitely choose to do the right thing (fighting for the living), that would be a decisive factor to sway Tyrion to the Starks\u2019 side, if Dany abandons the fight for the living prematurely. It\u2019s independent of the news about Jon\u2019s parentage. I guess once Jaime arrives in WF, he will have a private chat with Tyrion, in which Tyrion knows that Cersei cheats. So, to protect his siblings, \u00a0he will <a href=\"https://springwolvesofwinterfell.tumblr.com/post/184066658575/springwolvesofwinterfell-the-consequences-of\">cover such news from Dany</a>, knowing that she is not tolerant and would harshly punish both Cersei and Jaime (and even Tyrion himself) if she knows. He might even secretly make a deal with the Starks in case Dany turns on them.\u00a0</p><p>However, sooner or later, Dany will realize that the Lannister duo hide the news from her. Coupling with Jon\u2019s parentage (I don\u2019t know how they would reveal the news to the public yet, but it will be absolutely dramatic), Dany will be on fire. My bet is she\u2019s setting WF on fire before she leaves.\u00a0</p><p>At this point, I think Tyrion would firmly choose his brother over Dany. He will stay with Jaime in WF. Now he knows that Dany will go South to punish Cersei, his next mission is <a href=\"https://springwolvesofwinterfell.tumblr.com/post/183989590974/springwolvesofwinterfell-will-the-time-of\">secure an alliance with the Starks for Cersei</a> to save her arse. His role has always been a negotiator.</p><h2>What does true love mean?</h2><p>To add more complication to the mix, I believe, at some point, Tyrion will fall in love with Sansa. And his affection for her could be a decisive factor, that moves him for better (or worse?). We will have to wait to see how it turns out.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"592\" data-orig-height=\"333\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5532278c9da83cf442dac81241c80e39/tumblr_inline_ppxz065iDv1v86ltz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"592\" data-orig-height=\"333\"></figure><p>About his fate, in my opinion, Tyrion\u2019s fate was sealed the moment he cursed the whole King\u2019s Landing and killed his father. He will see with his own eyes how his curse becomes real, under the hand of his once beloved Queen, the one he helped bring to Westeros. That would be a very very tragic moment for Tyrion. <b>He would not able to forgive himself for wishing such horrible fate for people of this city</b>, and now it is a reality, a reality he helped to forge. In some sense, he has become the monster everyone thinks he is.\u00a0<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0160954ef53b5dfd6854a894988dffad/tumblr_inline_ppxzj02Ctb1v86ltz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"900\" data-orig-height=\"600\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/069419612176007f8c1548c77c62fe13/tumblr_inline_ppxznqxt9Q1v86ltz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"900\" data-orig-height=\"600\"></figure><p>Would Tyrion redeem himself? I think, he would. All his life, Tyrion has been <b>seeking love, acceptance and recognition</b>, from his family and from other people. But he never knows what true love is, except the brotherly love with Jaime. All he\u2019s ever known was politics, money matters and whoring.\u00a0His relationship with Shae was lust and possession. With Dany, it was a mixture of adoration, fear, the thirst for revenge on Cersei (now he realizes how wrong he was to wish so), and the hope to have his place in building a new world (he will also realize he chooses the wrong person to put this hope on). To make his arc full circle, <a href=\"https://springwolvesofwinterfell.tumblr.com/post/184008677819/springwolvesofwinterfell\">he will in the end understand what love truly means</a>. <b>Why I believe true love will matter for Tyrion?</b> Because of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miG9zMFyTEc\">this converstion from season 2 with Cersei</a>. It was moment after Myrcella\u2019s departure for Dorne (due to a betrothal Tyrion arranged for her) and before the riot in KL (when Sansa was nearly raped and Tyrion was panicked that they lost her.)</p><figure data-orig-width=\"932\" data-orig-height=\"521\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/766ca151dce5c481d71df049a0476772/tumblr_inline_ppxzwf0Csb1v86ltz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"932\" data-orig-height=\"521\"></figure><blockquote><p>One day I pray you love someone.

Before I take her from you.</b>\u00a0(Cersei to Tyrion, 2x06)<br></p></blockquote><p>Interestingly, the camera panned to Sansa after Tyrion left the scene.</p><p>Throughout season 2, 3 and the beginning of season 4, they\u2019ve already planted the seed of romance between Tyrion and Sansa (\u2019though one-sided). So what would mean for Tyrion if he realizes that he truly loves someone? Sadly for him, that person might not love him back. What would he do?\u00a0</p><h2>To love is to sacrifce</h2><p>As Peter Dinklage has said about the Tyrion\u2019s arc, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnet.com%2Fnews%2Fgame-of-thrones-ends-beautifully-for-tyrion-peter-dinklage-says%2F&amp;t=Zjk1OTM2NDgyNDI2MGIwNDM1ZWY1YWMxYjY3Y2QwN2FlZGJlZjk5OCxOWklONW55ZA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AaXNGUUplLruDKaOiwjtU5A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fspringwolvesofwinterfell.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F184008677819%2Fspringwolvesofwinterfell&amp;m=1\">\u201cIt <b>ends beautifully</b> for my character <b>whether it be tragic or not</b>.</a>\u201d, so a tragic end is almost guaranteed. But it will be a beautiful end,\u00a0we will lose lots of tears over the departure of his character. And I think, all of us could be happy for him, if in the last days of his life, Tyrion would understand what it means to truly love someone. Maybe he would never get anything in return, but at least such love brings him a little joy. That\u2019s the sweet part of love. The bitter part?

That would be a very very tragic moment for Tyrion. <b>He would not able to forgive himself for wishing such horrible fate for people of this city</b>, and now it is a reality, a reality he helped to forge.

But maybe with Tyrion&rsquo;s departure, Jaime would find the passion to<b> realize his brother&rsquo;s dream</b> of a new world. So, in that way, Jaime becomes the man their father always wanted him to be (a ruler), but just not in the way Tywin expected.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e9e0dfb4f926e6347eecdf1220c899c7/tumblr_inline_ppy1v4XkFW1v86ltz_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>Sansa</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6c75a7fef646bfc1d557646f382a2a16/tumblr_inline_ppy21igLdz1v86ltz_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Note how Tyrion was captivated by Sansa.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4673f438ddaeee2877adedd0f97aec9f/tumblr_ou2z37hj831tjd550o6_250.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>We&rsquo;ve seen how Sansa ruled WF effectively.
