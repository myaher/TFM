It was a peaceful day for once. Neither of you had to work or be anywhere. You had slept in late, only waking up when John placed kisses on your shoulder. You could hear the rain beating down outside, which added to the tranquility.</p><p>You turned over in John\u2019s arms and smiled at him. He looked back at you with a smile of his own as he placed a quick kiss on your lips. He looked well rested, which is something he needed and deserved. His job was grueling and not one that was typical for just anyone. He was a hitman. The best one at that. You were terrified at first, but you loved John so you\u2019d grown used to the idea. He was trying to get out of the field. However, that was easier said than done apparently.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, John,\u201d you greeted him.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Y/N,\u201d he greeted back with a small smile. \u201cIt\u2019s past noon. We both slept in pretty late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou deserved the rest,\u201d you told him and cuddled into him, placing your head on his chest as he moved to lay on his back.</p><p>His arms wrapped around you before he leaned his head down to place a kiss on the top of your head. His hand played with your hair as you both laid there and listened to the rain outside. It wasn\u2019t long till John\u2019s dog jumped up in the bed with you two. He usually always laid with you both unless he went to go wander around or whatever else he did. He piled up at the bottom of the bed near your feet.</p><p>\u201cJohn, we have to give that dog a name already,\u201d you commented.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s used to just being called dog, sweetheart,\u201d he responded with a chuckle. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to mind it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but still,\u201d you said. \u201cEvery dog deserves a name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d he said. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>You started rubbing John\u2019s bare chest. He was only in a pair of sleep pants as you were in leggings and one of his shirts that was big on you. You didn\u2019t plan on changing out of it anytime soon either.</p><p>You felt like you were about to fall asleep again until there was a loud crashing sound that sounded from downstairs. You felt John tense beneath you before you both bolted up. John\u2019s dog raised up in alert too, but kept quiet as he listened. There were more noises and you felt the hair on the back of your neck stand on end.</p><p>\u201cY/N, take the dog and lock yourselves up in the bathroom now,\u201d John told you as he moved out of bed and grabbed a gun from the nightstand, which made your eyes widen.</p><p>\u201cBut John-\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo now!\u201d He told you firmly. \u201cDon\u2019t come out unless I tell you to, understand?\u201d</p><p>You nodded and did as he told you. You jumped out of bed and grabbed the collar on the pit bull, leading him into the bathroom with you. You assumed John had you take him with you because he knew the dog would protect you if he had to. You shut the door to the bathroom and locked it before you turned, leaning back against it. John\u2019s dog looked up at you and seemed to be on high alert.</p><p>You listened closely for anything and heard some gun shots along with shouting. Your eyes widened as you gasped, moving your hand to cover your mouth. You\u2019d never been in the middle of any of John\u2019s business. He made sure of that. You didn\u2019t know if you were scared for yourself or for John. John could handle himself, but you still worried of course.</p><p>The sound of the door handle trying to be opened caused you to seize your thoughts and jump in surprise. The person on the other side didn\u2019t say anything, which had you suspicious.</p><p>\u201cJohn, is that you?\u201d You asked, but still there was no answer.</p><p>Suddenly, there was a banging on the door like someone was trying to break it down. You screamed and moved away from it as John\u2019s dog started barking. You didn\u2019t know what to do at this point. You were trapped.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for the door to bust open, revealing two burly men who looked terrifying. One stepped inside, but he didn\u2019t make it far before John\u2019s dog growled loudly and attacked him. The gun fell from the guy\u2019s hand from the shock of it.</p><p>\u201cGet this fucking dog off of me!\u201d He yelled as he fought him off. He actually managed to push him off long enough to make a run for it out of the room, but John\u2019s dog was hot on his trails.</p><p>The other guy ignored the commotion as he came towards you. He didn\u2019t have a gun himself, which was good, but there was no way you could fight this big guy. He started grabbing you, but you didn\u2019t make it easy for him. You tried hitting him and kicking him, but it hardly phased him. He grabbed you by your hair and pushed you into the wall hard, pressing his body into yours to keep you from moving. You groaned in pain from the contact and squirmed around.</p><p>\u201cStop fucking fighting,\u201d he said as he pulled on your hair harder, causing you to scream out in pain. It felt like he was going to rip your hair out. \u201cI can either bring you in to my boss alive or dead. He didn\u2019t tell me either way. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere with you!\u201d You yelled out as you still tried to squirm away from him. You finally managed to maneuver yourself to knee the guy in the groin. He let go of you and fell to his knees. You made a break for it, but you didn\u2019t make it far before he grabbed you by your ankle. You fell hard, hitting your head on the ground. You felt a bit dazed, but you still tried crawling away from him.</p><p>\u201cYou little bitch!\u201d He yelled out angrily. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you for that!\u201d</p><p>He sounded like he meant it. He finally managed to pull you to him and had you turned on your back as he got on top of you. As if his weight wasn\u2019t crushing you enough, he wrapped his hands around your neck and began choking you. You sputtered and gasped for air as you tried clawing his hands off your neck. You looked around the best you could and found the gun near your leg. You reached out for it, but it was just out of reach. You tried with all your might till you finally felt the cool metal on your hand. You\u2019d never shot anyone before. You didn\u2019t have time to think about it though. You were starting to see black spots and knew you would lose consciousness soon. You held the gun up and pulled the trigger.</p><p>Everything felt like it was moving in slow motion after that.</p><p>The guys eyes widened in surprise from the gunshot. His hands finally let go of your neck as he fell back off of you. You inhaled as much air as you could as you coughed and sputtered. You felt dizzy as you crawled back from the man until your back hit the wall. You watched in shock as he looked down at the wound. Blood was pouring out of it at a rapid speed. He started coughing it up before he took one last breath.</p><p>You were trying to regain your normal breathing as you sat with the gun still in your hand, trying to process what had just happened.</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d John yelled as he came running into the bathroom. He looked worse for wear. His face was bloody and already bruising.</p><p>He looked from the man that was laying on the ground to you, holding the gun in your hand with a look of absolute shock. He quickly went over to you and knelt down in front of you. He reached out for the gun in your hand carefully. You flinched when you felt his hand come into contact with yours.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay,\u201d he whispered softly. \u201cIt\u2019s just me. It\u2019s okay now.\u201d</p><p>You let him take the gun as you looked at him. He put the gun off to the side before he looked back at you, placing his hands on your face gently and checking you over. He frowned slightly when he noticed the markings on your neck from when the guy was choking you. It would definitely bruise. He ran his fingers slightly over the markings.</p><p>\u201cI just shot a man,\u201d you mumbled out. \u201cJohn, I just shot a man an-and killed him.\u201d</p><p>John sighed as he picked you up, bridal style, and carried you out of the bathroom so you would no longer have to see the guy. He was pretty beat up himself, but that wouldn\u2019t stop him from carrying his girl.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes, sweetheart,\u201d John spoke softly into your ear as he walked out of the bedroom.</p><p>You did just that and hid your face in his chest. You suspected that there were more bodies lying around that he was keeping you from seeing, which didn\u2019t bother you. John called for his dog and he came over to you both, walking alongside you as you went out to the car. John put you inside then helped the dog in before taking his spot in the drivers seat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take us somewhere else to stay,\u201d John said as he drove. \u201cWe\u2019ll stay there until I can call in someone to clean the place up.\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t say anything, which worried John. He pulled over and put the car in park before turning to you. He took your hand in his and kissed it.</p><p>\u201cY/N, are you okay?\u201d He asked like he already knew the answer to that question.</p><p>\u201cI just&hellip;can\u2019t believe I shot someone,\u201d you responded as you looked back at him.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, I\u2019m so fucking sorry that that happened,\u201d he said. \u201cI should\u2019ve protected you better. There were so many of them and I tried to keep them all from going upstairs. You did what you had to do to protect yourself though. Those were bad men that have done bad things. I\u2019m sorry it came to that, but I\u2019m proud of you for being able to protect yourself. I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re still here with me.\u201d</p><p>You nodded at John. You knew he was right. John did what he could and you did what you had to do. You hate that it came to that, but you did what you had to to protect John and yourself.</p><p>John leaned over and placed a soft kiss on your lips then rested his forehead against your own. </p><p>\u201cI love you, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, John.\u201d</p><p>You both stayed like that for a minute or two before he pulled away to call in a cleanup crew then started driving again.</p>",

It was a peaceful day for once. Neither of you had to work or be anywhere. You had slept in late, only waking up when John placed kisses on your shoulder. You could hear the rain beating down outside, which added to the tranquility.</p><p>You turned over in John\u2019s arms and smiled at him. He looked back at you with a smile of his own as he placed a quick kiss on your lips. He looked well rested, which is something he needed and deserved. His job was grueling and not one that was typical for just anyone. He was a hitman. The best one at that. You were terrified at first, but you loved John so you\u2019d grown used to the idea. He was trying to get out of the field. However, that was easier said than done apparently.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, John,\u201d you greeted him.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Y/N,\u201d he greeted back with a small smile. \u201cIt\u2019s past noon. We both slept in pretty late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou deserved the rest,\u201d you told him and cuddled into him, placing your head on his chest as he moved to lay on his back.</p><p>His arms wrapped around you before he leaned his head down to place a kiss on the top of your head. His hand played with your hair as you both laid there and listened to the rain outside. It wasn\u2019t long till John\u2019s dog jumped up in the bed with you two. He usually always laid with you both unless he went to go wander around or whatever else he did. He piled up at the bottom of the bed near your feet.</p><p>\u201cJohn, we have to give that dog a name already,\u201d you commented.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s used to just being called dog, sweetheart,\u201d he responded with a chuckle. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to mind it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but still,\u201d you said. \u201cEvery dog deserves a name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d he said. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>You started rubbing John\u2019s bare chest. He was only in a pair of sleep pants as you were in leggings and one of his shirts that was big on you. You didn\u2019t plan on changing out of it anytime soon either.</p><p>You felt like you were about to fall asleep again until there was a loud crashing sound that sounded from downstairs. You felt John tense beneath you before you both bolted up. John\u2019s dog raised up in alert too, but kept quiet as he listened. There were more noises and you felt the hair on the back of your neck stand on end.</p><p>\u201cY/N, take the dog and lock yourselves up in the bathroom now,\u201d John told you as he moved out of bed and grabbed a gun from the nightstand, which made your eyes widen.</p><p>\u201cBut John-\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo now!\u201d He told you firmly. \u201cDon\u2019t come out unless I tell you to, understand?\u201d</p><p>You nodded and did as he told you. You jumped out of bed and grabbed the collar on the pit bull, leading him into the bathroom with you. You assumed John had you take him with you because he knew the dog would protect you if he had to. You shut the door to the bathroom and locked it before you turned, leaning back against it. John\u2019s dog looked up at you and seemed to be on high alert.</p><p>You listened closely for anything and heard some gun shots along with shouting. Your eyes widened as you gasped, moving your hand to cover your mouth. You\u2019d never been in the middle of any of John\u2019s business. He made sure of that. You didn\u2019t know if you were scared for yourself or for John. John could handle himself, but you still worried of course.</p><p>The sound of the door handle trying to be opened caused you to seize your thoughts and jump in surprise. The person on the other side didn\u2019t say anything, which had you suspicious.</p><p>\u201cJohn, is that you?\u201d You asked, but still there was no answer.</p><p>Suddenly, there was a banging on the door like someone was trying to break it down. You screamed and moved away from it as John\u2019s dog started barking. You didn\u2019t know what to do at this point. You were trapped.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for the door to bust open, revealing two burly men who looked terrifying. One stepped inside, but he didn\u2019t make it far before John\u2019s dog growled loudly and attacked him. The gun fell from the guy\u2019s hand from the shock of it.</p><p>\u201cGet this fucking dog off of me!\u201d He yelled as he fought him off. He actually managed to push him off long enough to make a run for it out of the room, but John\u2019s dog was hot on his trails.</p><p>The other guy ignored the commotion as he came towards you. He didn\u2019t have a gun himself, which was good, but there was no way you could fight this big guy. He started grabbing you, but you didn\u2019t make it easy for him. You tried hitting him and kicking him, but it hardly phased him. He grabbed you by your hair and pushed you into the wall hard, pressing his body into yours to keep you from moving. You groaned in pain from the contact and squirmed around.</p><p>\u201cStop fucking fighting,\u201d he said as he pulled on your hair harder, causing you to scream out in pain. It felt like he was going to rip your hair out. \u201cI can either bring you in to my boss alive or dead. He didn\u2019t tell me either way. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere with you!\u201d You yelled out as you still tried to squirm away from him. You finally managed to maneuver yourself to knee the guy in the groin. He let go of you and fell to his knees. You made a break for it, but you didn\u2019t make it far before he grabbed you by your ankle. You fell hard, hitting your head on the ground. You felt a bit dazed, but you still tried crawling away from him.</p><p>\u201cYou little bitch!\u201d He yelled out angrily. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you for that!\u201d</p><p>He sounded like he meant it. He finally managed to pull you to him and had you turned on your back as he got on top of you. As if his weight wasn\u2019t crushing you enough, he wrapped his hands around your neck and began choking you. You sputtered and gasped for air as you tried clawing his hands off your neck. You looked around the best you could and found the gun near your leg. You reached out for it, but it was just out of reach. You tried with all your might till you finally felt the cool metal on your hand. You\u2019d never shot anyone before. You didn\u2019t have time to think about it though. You were starting to see black spots and knew you would lose consciousness soon. You held the gun up and pulled the trigger.</p><p>Everything felt like it was moving in slow motion after that.</p><p>The guys eyes widened in surprise from the gunshot. His hands finally let go of your neck as he fell back off of you. You inhaled as much air as you could as you coughed and sputtered. You felt dizzy as you crawled back from the man until your back hit the wall. You watched in shock as he looked down at the wound. Blood was pouring out of it at a rapid speed. He started coughing it up before he took one last breath.</p><p>You were trying to regain your normal breathing as you sat with the gun still in your hand, trying to process what had just happened.</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d John yelled as he came running into the bathroom. He looked worse for wear. His face was bloody and already bruising.</p><p>He looked from the man that was laying on the ground to you, holding the gun in your hand with a look of absolute shock. He quickly went over to you and knelt down in front of you. He reached out for the gun in your hand carefully.

You flinched when you felt his hand come into contact with yours.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay,\u201d he whispered softly. \u201cIt\u2019s just me. It\u2019s okay now.\u201d</p><p>You let him take the gun as you looked at him. He put the gun off to the side before he looked back at you, placing his hands on your face gently and checking you over. He frowned slightly when he noticed the markings on your neck from when the guy was choking you. It would definitely bruise. He ran his fingers slightly over the markings.</p><p>\u201cI just shot a man,\u201d you mumbled out. \u201cJohn, I just shot a man an-and killed him.\u201d</p><p>John sighed as he picked you up, bridal style, and carried you out of the bathroom so you would no longer have to see the guy. He was pretty beat up himself, but that wouldn\u2019t stop him from carrying his girl.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes, sweetheart,\u201d John spoke softly into your ear as he walked out of the bedroom.</p><p>You did just that and hid your face in his chest. You suspected that there were more bodies lying around that he was keeping you from seeing, which didn\u2019t bother you. John called for his dog and he came over to you both, walking alongside you as you went out to the car. John put you inside then helped the dog in before taking his spot in the drivers seat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take us somewhere else to stay,\u201d John said as he drove. \u201cWe\u2019ll stay there until I can call in someone to clean the place up.\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t say anything, which worried John. He pulled over and put the car in park before turning to you. He took your hand in his and kissed it.</p><p>\u201cY/N, are you okay?\u201d He asked like he already knew the answer to that question.</p><p>\u201cI just\u2026can\u2019t believe I shot someone,\u201d you responded as you looked back at him.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, I\u2019m so fucking sorry that that happened,\u201d he said. \u201cI should\u2019ve protected you better. There were so many of them and I tried to keep them all from going upstairs. You did what you had to do to protect yourself though. Those were bad men that have done bad things. I\u2019m sorry it came to that, but I\u2019m proud of you for being able to protect yourself. I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re still here with me.\u201d</p><p>You nodded at John. You knew he was right. John did what he could and you did what you had to do. You hate that it came to that, but you did what you had to to protect John and yourself.</p><p>John leaned over and placed a soft kiss on your lips then rested his forehead against your own. </p><p>\u201cI love you, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, John.\u201d</p><p>You both stayed like that for a minute or two before he pulled away to call in a cleanup crew then started driving again.</p></p>",

It was a peaceful day for once. Neither of you had to work or be anywhere. You had slept in late, only waking up when John placed kisses on your shoulder. You could hear the rain beating down outside, which added to the tranquility.</p><p>You turned over in John&rsquo;s arms and smiled at him. He looked back at you with a smile of his own as he placed a quick kiss on your lips. He looked well rested, which is something he needed and deserved. His job was grueling and not one that was typical for just anyone. He was a hitman. The best one at that. You were terrified at first, but you loved John so you&rsquo;d grown used to the idea. He was trying to get out of the field. However, that was easier said than done apparently.</p><p>&ldquo;Good morning, John,&rdquo; you greeted him.</p><p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, Y/N,&rdquo; he greeted back with a small smile. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s past noon. We both slept in pretty late.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You deserved the rest,&rdquo; you told him and cuddled into him, placing your head on his chest as he moved to lay on his back.</p><p>His arms wrapped around you before he leaned his head down to place a kiss on the top of your head. His hand played with your hair as you both laid there and listened to the rain outside. It wasn&rsquo;t long till John&rsquo;s dog jumped up in the bed with you two. He usually always laid with you both unless he went to go wander around or whatever else he did. He piled up at the bottom of the bed near your feet.</p><p>&ldquo;John, we have to give that dog a name already,&rdquo; you commented.</p><p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s used to just being called dog, sweetheart,&rdquo; he responded with a chuckle. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t seem to mind it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, but still,&rdquo; you said. &ldquo;Every dog deserves a name.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll figure it out,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>You started rubbing John&rsquo;s bare chest. He was only in a pair of sleep pants as you were in leggings and one of his shirts that was big on you. You didn&rsquo;t plan on changing out of it anytime soon either.</p><p>You felt like you were about to fall asleep again until there was a loud crashing sound that sounded from downstairs. You felt John tense beneath you before you both bolted up. John&rsquo;s dog raised up in alert too, but kept quiet as he listened. There were more noises and you felt the hair on the back of your neck stand on end.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, take the dog and lock yourselves up in the bathroom now,&rdquo; John told you as he moved out of bed and grabbed a gun from the nightstand, which made your eyes widen.</p><p>&ldquo;But John-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go now!&rdquo; He told you firmly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come out unless I tell you to, understand?&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded and did as he told you. You jumped out of bed and grabbed the collar on the pit bull, leading him into the bathroom with you. You assumed John had you take him with you because he knew the dog would protect you if he had to. You shut the door to the bathroom and locked it before you turned, leaning back against it. John&rsquo;s dog looked up at you and seemed to be on high alert.</p><p>You listened closely for anything and heard some gun shots along with shouting. Your eyes widened as you gasped, moving your hand to cover your mouth. You&rsquo;d never been in the middle of any of John&rsquo;s business. He made sure of that. You didn&rsquo;t know if you were scared for yourself or for John. John could handle himself, but you still worried of course.</p><p>The sound of the door handle trying to be opened caused you to seize your thoughts and jump in surprise. The person on the other side didn&rsquo;t say anything, which had you suspicious.</p><p>&ldquo;John, is that you?&rdquo; You asked, but still there was no answer.</p><p>Suddenly, there was a banging on the door like someone was trying to break it down. You screamed and moved away from it as John&rsquo;s dog started barking. You didn&rsquo;t know what to do at this point. You were trapped.</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t take long for the door to bust open, revealing two burly men who looked terrifying. One stepped inside, but he didn&rsquo;t make it far before John&rsquo;s dog growled loudly and attacked him. The gun fell from the guy&rsquo;s hand from the shock of it.</p><p>&ldquo;Get this fucking dog off of me!&rdquo; He yelled as he fought him off. He actually managed to push him off long enough to make a run for it out of the room, but John&rsquo;s dog was hot on his trails.</p><p>The other guy ignored the commotion as he came towards you. He didn&rsquo;t have a gun himself, which was good, but there was no way you could fight this big guy. He started grabbing you, but you didn&rsquo;t make it easy for him. You tried hitting him and kicking him, but it hardly phased him. He grabbed you by your hair and pushed you into the wall hard, pressing his body into yours to keep you from moving. You groaned in pain from the contact and squirmed around.</p><p>&ldquo;Stop fucking fighting,&rdquo; he said as he pulled on your hair harder, causing you to scream out in pain. It felt like he was going to rip your hair out. &ldquo;I can either bring you in to my boss alive or dead. He didn&rsquo;t tell me either way. Your choice.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going anywhere with you!&rdquo; You yelled out as you still tried to squirm away from him. You finally managed to maneuver yourself to knee the guy in the groin. He let go of you and fell to his knees. You made a break for it, but you didn&rsquo;t make it far before he grabbed you by your ankle. You fell hard, hitting your head on the ground. You felt a bit dazed, but you still tried crawling away from him.</p><p>&ldquo;You little bitch!&rdquo; He yelled out angrily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to kill you for that!&rdquo;</p><p>He sounded like he meant it. He finally managed to pull you to him and had you turned on your back as he got on top of you. As if his weight wasn&rsquo;t crushing you enough, he wrapped his hands around your neck and began choking you. You sputtered and gasped for air as you tried clawing his hands off your neck. You looked around the best you could and found the gun near your leg. You reached out for it, but it was just out of reach. You tried with all your might till you finally felt the cool metal on your hand. You&rsquo;d never shot anyone before. You didn&rsquo;t have time to think about it though. You were starting to see black spots and knew you would lose consciousness soon. You held the gun up and pulled the trigger.</p><p>Everything felt like it was moving in slow motion after that.</p><p>The guys eyes widened in surprise from the gunshot. His hands finally let go of your neck as he fell back off of you. You inhaled as much air as you could as you coughed and sputtered. You felt dizzy as you crawled back from the man until your back hit the wall. You watched in shock as he looked down at the wound. Blood was pouring out of it at a rapid speed. He started coughing it up before he took one last breath.</p><p>You were trying to regain your normal breathing as you sat with the gun still in your hand, trying to process what had just happened.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N!&rdquo; John yelled as he came running into the bathroom. He looked worse for wear. His face was bloody and already bruising.</p><p>He looked from the man that was laying on the ground to you, holding the gun in your hand with a look of absolute shock. He quickly went over to you and knelt down in front of you. He reached out for the gun in your hand carefully. You flinched when you felt his hand come into contact with yours.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; he whispered softly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just me. It&rsquo;s okay now.&rdquo;</p><p>You let him take the gun as you looked at him. He put the gun off to the side before he looked back at you, placing his hands on your face gently and checking you over.

One particular song called \"Above All\" (Like a Rose ...) by Michael W. Smith helped him through his most difficult moments.\n\n\"It arrived when I was confused and angry. I didn't think I could go on. The song described how Jesus was rejected and alone. That thought took me to a place \u2014 it opened an interior door that held me while on the cross,\" an emotional Caviezel explained. \"The experience of feeling rejected and alone as all those around me laughed while drinking their hot coffees, oblivious to what was occurring. Jesus must have felt like this \u2014 forsaken, rejected, alone, and despised. It helped me pray in a very deep way \u2014 to pray without words, to pray from the heart. The discomfort, the loneliness, the split shoulder, the raw flesh all forced me into the arms of God because I had nowhere else to go for a performance I knew I was unable to create.\"\nJim Caviezel, Shamelessly Catholic",
