They don&rsquo;t pretend for a second that he isn&rsquo;t coming back. That&rsquo;s how this works.</p><p>That&rsquo;s how Pepper stays functioning.</p><p>She&rsquo;s in the kitchen when it happens. Steve and Natasha are also there, and neither of them are quite able to look her in the eye as they fix their breakfasts. Pepper considers that solely their problem, iron doesn&rsquo;t feel awkward.</p><p>FRIDAY&rsquo;s alert sounds as she is pouring her second cup of coffee, and she starts and spills some onto the counter. She is too focused on the AI to clean it up.</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Potts, I&rsquo;m receiving a transmission from off-planet!&rdquo;</p><p>Pepper&rsquo;s heart leaps into her throat and it&rsquo;s hard to force the words out around it.</p><p>&ldquo;Play it please FRIDAY,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>A network of blue lights dance in the air in front of her, projecting an image of Tony. He&rsquo;s mid-sentence, tapping what must be his helmet as he talks.</p><p>&ldquo;-thing on?&rdquo; He leans back against a wall and Pepper&rsquo;s gut clenches at just how awful he looks. <i>awful but alive alive alive.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Hey Miss Potts,&rdquo; he says and Pepper can&rsquo;t place his odd expression. Natasha and Steve have stood and and moved to stand either side of her, like some kind of guard detail. They watch the message grimly.</p><p>&ldquo;If you find this recording don&rsquo;t feel bad about this.&rdquo;</p><p><i>no.</i> Pepper&rsquo;s heart drops from her throat to the pit of her stomach.</p><p>&ldquo;Part of the journey is the end,&rdquo; he continues and irrationally she wants to tell FRIDAY to stop, to pretend that she isn&rsquo;t looking at his goodbye. &ldquo;Just for the record being adrift in space with zero promise of rescue is more fun than it sounds.&rdquo;</p><p>He&rsquo;s trying to be brave for her. She can see it in his face, in the way he&rsquo;s not looking at the helmet, in the set of his jaw.</p><p>&ldquo;Food and water ran out four days ago, oxygen will run out tomorrow morning&hellip; that&rsquo;ll be it.&rdquo; His voice breaks and his mask slips and she can see how scared he is. Then he leans forward and something like peace settles into his eyes. That acceptance might be the most terrifying thing of all.</p><p>&ldquo;When I drift off, I will dream about you,&rdquo; he says with absolute conviction. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always you.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony reaches out and the message cuts off. The finality of it hits her like a blow to the stomach.</p><p>Pepper blinks and stares for a moment and is dimly aware of Steve and Natasha exchanging a panicked look. She delves down deep inside herself, searching for that familiar iron. She needs something to lean on, something strong to hold her up as she struggles with the weight of his words, but there&rsquo;s nothing there. Nothing but an endless starry expanse and somewhere out there, Tony Stark struggling for breath.</p></p>",

Catch!\u201d</p><p>&ldquo;What?\u201d Bucky said in alarm, hands scrambling for a grip on Tony\u2019s armor. \u201cNo, don\u2019t-\u201d</p><p>Tony rapidly adjusted his trajectory upwards and threw Bucky as hard as he could at Thor, who turned to look just in time to get sideswiped by two-hundred pounds of angry supersoldier.</p><p>\u201cSir, the light-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Bucky make it?\u201d Tony couldn\u2019t tell, the HUD was flickering as all power was diverted to his repulsors. \u201cIs everyone else-\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cOwwww,\u201d Tony said, his aching body dragging him back into unwelcoming consciousness. He tried to move but couldn\u2019t; something was weighing his limbs down. \u00a0He opened his eyes and started to panic when all he saw was blackness. \u201cWhat-\u201d He tried to move again, straining against whatever was holding him, then finally the smell of metal, grease, and hydraulic fluid registered and he realized was in his suit. \u00a0The complete and utter blackness, though, even the lack of indicator lights, meant that somehow, despite all of his backups and failsafes, the suit was completely dead.</p><!-- more --><p>He closed his eyes and forced himself to relax, taking long breaths in to the count of five and then letting them out slowly, trying very deliberately to not think about the amount of air left in his suit. \u00a0Then he laboriously lifted one hand and fumbled for the emergency catch, hands slipping before he could finally dig the thick metal fingers of the gauntlet into the hidden lever.</p><p>Finally it clicked and the whole suit split open and folded away from him, leaving him gasping gratefully for air and sitting up, stumbling away from the claustrophobic nightmare of a dead suit. \u00a0He rubbed his arms against the slight chill, trying to get his bearings. It was night-time, which was\u2026different, since it had been daytime before. \u00a0He was clearly still in London, though, so\u2026the green light must have killed his suit, but why in the hell would his team leave him lying in it long enough for it to get dark? Unless they couldn\u2019t find him, but Tony had a beacon with a separate battery backup for just that purpose.</p><p>He edged carefully out of the alley he was in to the street, finding it strangely dark and deserted. \u00a0He didn\u2019t have a cell phone or his watch, so he had no idea what time it was, but even the streetlights were dark, which didn\u2019t make any sense no matter what goddamn time it was.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t panic,\u201d Tony told himself sternly, and went to go sit next to his suit. By the dim light of the moon and stars he pried into the metal plating and realized to his dismay that the battery backup was mysteriously dead, too. \u00a0\u201cStill not a good time to panic,\u201d he reminded himself, even though he could feel his heart starting to race. \u00a0He sat for a little while longer, concentrating on the chill of the paving bricks under him, the damp edge in the air, and the familiar feeling of his suit under his fingertips, until his heart calmed. \u00a0Once he felt steadier he stood and dragged the suit behind a pile of rubble, partially disassembling it so it looked less like a robot and more like a pile of scrap metal. \u00a0Then he rubbed his hands together, and started walking even though he was sorely tempted to stay right where he was until the comforting light of dawn.</p><p>The street was still eerily dark and still until a door opened down a side street and light and noise spilled out of it. \u00a0Tony headed eagerly in that direction, slipping gratefully through the door that promised people and perhaps answers, then stopped dead once he was inside.</p><p><i>Movie set</i>, he thought wildly, staring wide-eyed at the crowd of soldiers in front of him, wearing uniforms that were straight out of World War II. \u00a0Someone came in behind him and jostled him out of the doorway, so he edged around the room, more unwilling to face the eerily deserted street than he was to find a deserted corner of this odd bar and its odder clientele and try to figure out how in the hell he got zapped back to World War II.</p><p>Well, actually, that was probably the least of the mysteries. \u00a0Stephen\u2019s bizarre green light was obviously the cause of that. The Avengers had been called to help him with an assault on the London Sanctuary, and the Mystical Morons of whatever who had been fighting them had obviously set off some sort of time trap that only Tony had been lucky enough to get caught in. The real questions were, how long was he going to be stuck here before Stephen found him and what in the hell was he going to do with himself until then?</p><p>Tony made his way through the soldiers, trying to find an empty seat from which he could figure out the answers to these burning questions, when the flash of a familiar profile made him pause.</p><p>Was that\u2026Tony edged closer and looked again, and sure enough, it was. \u201cBucky?\u201d he said in surprise and winced. Goddammit, Stephen was going to yell at him for this.</p><p>Bucky looked up from his drink, glancing around the bar before he caught Tony\u2019s eyes. \u00a0He looked like he should be drunk, short dark hair askew like he\u2019d been running his fingers through it, his shirt and coat partially unbuttoned, and stubble darkening his jaw \u2013 clearly Past Bucky gave as much of a shit about rules as Current Bucky \u2013 but his eyes were clear and sharp. \u201cYou seem to have the advantage of me,\u201d Bucky said, his gaze flickering over Tony with interest. \u00a0After a moment he must have come to some sort of conclusion because when he slid off the barstool to offer his hand, his smile was lazy but the look in his eyes was definitely\u2026not. <i>Uh-oh</i>, Tony thought, trying to quell the way that look made his pulse quicken. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d he said, automatically reaching out to shake Bucky\u2019s hand. \u00a0It was strong and calloused in his own, gripping for just a moment too long before he let go. Tony blinked rapidly as his entire view of James Buchanan Barnes shifted. \u00a0\u201cI knew it,\u201d Tony blurted. \u201cSteve said you\u2026\u201d At the last minute Tony remembered where and when he was and stopped talking. \u00a0Debating Bucky\u2019s sexual orientation could wait - especially since now he knew he had the trump card in that particular argument, given the fact that Tony hadn\u2019t been so smoothly eye-fucked since college. \u00a0&quot;You would be here,\u201c Tony finished, praying that he wasn\u2019t so far back in time that Steve was still back in New York, skinny and asthmatic.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re a friend of Steve\u2019s?\u201d Bucky said, sounding only mildly surprised, pulling out the stool next to him as he sat back down. Tony let out a silent breath and told himself to be more careful as he sat down. \u201cHow do you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrough Howard,\u201d Tony said, somewhat honestly. \u00a0\u201cBy reputation, mostly,\u201d he added. \u201cI doubt Steve would remember me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you\u2019re here looking for him, he just left. \u00a0Agent Carter just pulled him out for a\u2026meeting,\u201d he said. \u00a0\u201cSo it\u2019s just you and me,\u201d he continued with a curl of his mouth, taking a sip of his drink.</p><p>\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t, uh, looking for Steve,\u201d Tony said, swallowing thickly, trying not to be distracted by that mouth. \u00a0He realized this was the first time he\u2019d seen Bucky smile; if he did during Tony\u2019s time, it wasn\u2019t while Tony was around. \u00a0Not that he paid a lot of attention to Bucky\u2019s moods or anything, it was just\u2026he had a really nice smile. After a long moment, Tony realized that he was staring at Bucky\u2019s mouth and that the silence had stretched out just a bit too long. \u201cI just needed to get out for a bit, you know?\u201d he said quickly, looking down at the wood of the bar and hoping Bucky hadn\u2019t seen him staring.</p><p>Bucky snorted and nodded like <i>hell yeah, I know</i>. \u201cSo if you know Howard, you\u2019re probably one of those LA types,\u201d he said. \u00a0\u201cThat must be why you talk a little funny. And dress funny,\u201d he added, eyeing Tony, which made him run a hand self-consciously over his shirt. \u00a0He\u2019d been at Stark Industries for a raft of business meetings when the Avengers call had come in, so he had just thrown off his jacket and tie and climbed into his Iron Man suit.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess you could say that,\u201d Tony said. \u00a0When he saw a secret smirk flash across Bucky\u2019s face he suddenly got the sinking feeling that being an \u201cLA type\u201d meant something different in the 40s.</p><p>\u201cWant a drink?\u201d Bucky asked, thankfully changing the subject. &quot;I\u2019m buying,\u201d which was good because Tony didn\u2019t think this pub took AmEx.</p><p>This is a bad idea. Somewhere in the future Stephen was screaming about Tony messing with the flow of time. \u201cSure,\u201d Tony said anyway. \u00a0A few more minutes wouldn\u2019t hurt, right?</p><p>As Bucky knocked back the finger of whiskey that was left in his glass and gestured to the barkeep, Tony realized that if he wasn\u2019t drunk, he was desperately trying to be. \u00a0Suddenly he realized when and where he was, and he reflexively glanced around the room, looking for the other Howling Commandos. Or rather, the men who had, at some point tonight, just become the Howling Commandos.</p><p>\u201cWere you here to meet someone?\u201d Bucky said, voice suddenly carefully neutral as the bartender set a couple of glasses in front of them.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, no,\u201d Tony said, realizing that Bucky had seen him looking around. \u00a0\u201cI just\u2026thought I recognized someone. From work. Uh, I mean, you know. Howard\u2019s\u2026lab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201c Bucky visibly relaxed at that. \u00a0&quot;Well, cheers,\u201d he said as he slid Tony\u2019s glass over to him. Tony lifted his glass in acknowledgement and took a sip of his whiskey and almost gagged from the rough burn and sooty aftertaste of cheap whiskey. \u00a0He couldn\u2019t completely suppress a cough, however, and Bucky clapped him on the back, squeezing his shoulder. \u00a0Tony couldn\u2019t suppress the shiver that went down his spine at the contact, even as his eyes were still watering from the rotgut booze. \u00a0He hoped that Bucky wouldn\u2019t notice, but from the hooded look in his eyes he definitely did.</p><p>\u201cIf you spend a lot of time with Howard I imagine you\u2019re probably used to the good stuff,\u201d Bucky said with a half-smile. \u00a0\u201cDrink enough of it and you get used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d Tony said hoarsely, trying not to notice the way Bucky\u2019s long-fingered hands were cradling his glass as he took a drink. \u00a0&quot;Or maybe your taste buds just shrivel up and die.\u201d God, the burn and taste got <i>worse</i> the longer it lingered, so he took another sip just to stop it.</p><p>Bucky snorted. \u00a0&quot;I\u2019m in the Army, my taste buds died a long time ago.\u201c There was that smile again, Tony thought helplessly, suddenly seized by the need to see him laugh. \u201cSo what do you do for Howard?\u201d Bucky asked. \u00a0&quot;I\u2019ve been to his lab once or twice and I would definitely remember seeing you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI build things. \u00a0Help him design missiles and\u2026stuff.\u201d \u00a0Despite his best efforts he kept losing his train of thought whenever he caught Bucky\u2019s gaze. \u00a0The look in his eyes \u2013 along with the rotgut whiskey \u2013 was making heat curl through Tony\u2019s veins. \u00a0He\u2019d never admit it, least of all to Steve or God forbid, Bucky himself, but he had fantasized about Bucky looking at him just like this. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s all classified,\u201d Tony finished, before he said too much. \u00a0He took a deep breath, let it out slowly, and took another sip of whiskey.</p><p>\u201cThe last day I was in the States I went to the Stark Expo,\u201d Bucky said, smiling ruefully down into his drink. \u00a0\u201cDid you know him then? \u00a0With the-\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlying car?\u201d Tony said with a groaning laugh. \u00a0Howard had always hated it when people brought up the flying car. \u201cKinda. I\u2019m perfecting the repulsor technology, but he eventually gave up on the car idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad,\u201d Bucky said. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019d like to fly something like that one day. Flying car or a jet pack or something. \u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Tony made a thoughtful noise, wondering if that were true of future Bucky too, or if idle dreams like flying had been burned out of him by Hydra. \u201cSo, uh, what brings you here?\u201d he tried, trying to deflect the conversation away from himself.</p><p>Bucky shrugged, mouth twisting. \u00a0\u201cYou know, just\u2026trying to relax. \u00a0Let off some steam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how\u2019s that going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty good so far,\u201d Bucky said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m feeling optimistic for the rest of the night,\u201d he added, glancing at Tony out of the corner of his eye as he took a sip of his whiskey. \u00a0Tony felt his ears get hot like he was a teenager again. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how long I\u2019m going to be in town for,\u201d he said, trying to quell the situation, but when Bucky smirked and Tony listened to himself, he wanted to bang his head on the bar. \u00a0Tony took another swallow of the whiskey as punishment for running his mouth and grimaced at the taste, even as it made his fingertips tingle. \u00a0Apparently his subconscious was trying to talk him into doing something extremely stupid. Stephen was going to be so angry at him.</p><p>\u201cWell, these days, who is, right? \u00a0Don\u2019t know if you heard, but there\u2019s a war on. That\u2019s why you gotta carpe that diem.\u201d Bucky leaned over and tapped his almost empty glass against Tony\u2019s half-full one.</p><p>\u201cMore like <i>cave</i> that <i>virum</i>,\u201d Tony muttered to himself. He eyed the glass and Bucky, wondering just how many he\u2019d had already. \u00a0Looks like the super-soldier serum, knockoff though it may have been, was already affecting his metabolism. There was a sudden clamor from the next room and Bucky\u2019s head whipped up, looking a little wild around the edges. \u00a0It was just a moment, a second even, but it was enough to show how thin Bucky\u2019s easy-going veneer was. \u00a0When he saw Tony watching him, he tried to cover it with a smile but Tony could see how tight his shoulders were when he finished off his glass of whiskey. \u201cLook, I know what you\u2019ve been through,\u201d Tony said quietly. \u201cWhat you\u2019re going through.\u201d</p><p>Bucky laughed harshly, pushing his glass away and nodding at the bartender for another. \u201cOf course you do, the whole Western front knows, it\u2019s been in all the papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean I <i>know</i>,\u201d Tony repeated. \u201cI was \u2013 was captured too. And-\u201d Tony forced himself to say the word, though it was heavy and tasted like ash, \u201c-tortured. Not by Hydra. I was, uh, in the Middle East before I came here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Bucky stared at him, face unreadable. \u201cIs that why you came up to me? You thought we would be buddies because we, whaddyacallit, have some shared life experiences?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tony protested, running a hand through his hair. \u00a0\u201cI mean\u2026what I\u2019m trying to say is that when I came back and everyone knew, they all stared at me, as if they were just waiting for me to, I dunno, start crying or freaking out or something. It was so goddamn aggravating that I started avoiding people I knew so I wouldn\u2019t have to see that\u2026<i>look</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know that fucking look.\u201d \u00a0The bartender came over to top up his glass but this time Bucky just toyed with it instead of drinking.</p><p>Tony took another sip of his own, noting with relief that his glass was almost empty. \u00a0It was strange, talking to this\u2026version of Bucky. This man looked like he had just got out of hell, sure, but he didn\u2019t seem haunted by his past in the same way that Future Bucky was, weary and wary and tired. \u00a0He seemed lighter, somehow, even though the memories of Azzano must still be fresh.</p><p>Tony drained his glass. Thinking of Azzano was reminding him of Afghanistan, so he forced his thoughts back to the present. The past. Whatever. \u201cHey, when you finish that, wanna take a walk?\u201d he asked suddenly, the noisy crowd of the bar starting to seem grating instead of welcoming.</p><p>In his defense, when he said the words he really did <i>mean</i> just a walk, but when Bucky\u2019s eyebrows went up and his eyes grew hooded and dark, smile knowing, Tony realized his mouth had run away with him again. \u201cSure,\u201d Bucky drawled. \u00a0&quot;If you\u2019re in a hurry, let\u2019s go.\u201c \u00a0He drained his glass and put some money underneath it before sliding off the bar stool.</p>",

He tried to move but couldn\u2019t; something was weighing his limbs down. \u00a0He opened his eyes and started to panic when all he saw was blackness. \u201cWhat-\u201d He tried to move again, straining against whatever was holding him, then finally the smell of metal, grease, and hydraulic fluid registered and he realized was in his suit. \u00a0The complete and utter blackness, though, even the lack of indicator lights, meant that somehow, despite all of his backups and failsafes, the suit was completely dead.</p>[[MORE]]<p>He closed his eyes and forced himself to relax, taking long breaths in to the count of five and then letting them out slowly, trying very deliberately to not think about the amount of air left in his suit. \u00a0Then he laboriously lifted one hand and fumbled for the emergency catch, hands slipping before he could finally dig the thick metal fingers of the gauntlet into the hidden lever.</p><p>Finally it clicked and the whole suit split open and folded away from him, leaving him gasping gratefully for air and sitting up, stumbling away from the claustrophobic nightmare of a dead suit. \u00a0He rubbed his arms against the slight chill, trying to get his bearings. It was night-time, which was\u2026different, since it had been daytime before. \u00a0He was clearly still in London, though, so\u2026the green light must have killed his suit, but why in the hell would his team leave him lying in it long enough for it to get dark? Unless they couldn\u2019t find him, but Tony had a beacon with a separate battery backup for just that purpose.</p><p>He edged carefully out of the alley he was in to the street, finding it strangely dark and deserted. \u00a0He didn\u2019t have a cell phone or his watch, so he had no idea what time it was, but even the streetlights were dark, which didn\u2019t make any sense no matter what goddamn time it was.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t panic,\u201d Tony told himself sternly, and went to go sit next to his suit. By the dim light of the moon and stars he pried into the metal plating and realized to his dismay that the battery backup was mysteriously dead, too. \u00a0\u201cStill not a good time to panic,\u201d he reminded himself, even though he could feel his heart starting to race. \u00a0He sat for a little while longer, concentrating on the chill of the paving bricks under him, the damp edge in the air, and the familiar feeling of his suit under his fingertips, until his heart calmed. \u00a0Once he felt steadier he stood and dragged the suit behind a pile of rubble, partially disassembling it so it looked less like a robot and more like a pile of scrap metal. \u00a0Then he rubbed his hands together, and started walking even though he was sorely tempted to stay right where he was until the comforting light of dawn.</p><p>The street was still eerily dark and still until a door opened down a side street and light and noise spilled out of it. \u00a0Tony headed eagerly in that direction, slipping gratefully through the door that promised people and perhaps answers, then stopped dead once he was inside.</p><p><i>Movie set</i>, he thought wildly, staring wide-eyed at the crowd of soldiers in front of him, wearing uniforms that were straight out of World War II. \u00a0Someone came in behind him and jostled him out of the doorway, so he edged around the room, more unwilling to face the eerily deserted street than he was to find a deserted corner of this odd bar and its odder clientele and try to figure out how in the hell he got zapped back to World War II.</p><p>Well, actually, that was probably the least of the mysteries. \u00a0Stephen\u2019s bizarre green light was obviously the cause of that. The Avengers had been called to help him with an assault on the London Sanctuary, and the Mystical Morons of whatever who had been fighting them had obviously set off some sort of time trap that only Tony had been lucky enough to get caught in. The real questions were, how long was he going to be stuck here before Stephen found him and what in the hell was he going to do with himself until then?</p><p>Tony made his way through the soldiers, trying to find an empty seat from which he could figure out the answers to these burning questions, when the flash of a familiar profile made him pause.</p><p>Was that\u2026Tony edged closer and looked again, and sure enough, it was. \u201cBucky?\u201d he said in surprise and winced. Goddammit, Stephen was going to yell at him for this.</p><p>Bucky looked up from his drink, glancing around the bar before he caught Tony\u2019s eyes. \u00a0He looked like he should be drunk, short dark hair askew like he\u2019d been running his fingers through it, his shirt and coat partially unbuttoned, and stubble darkening his jaw \u2013 clearly Past Bucky gave as much of a shit about rules as Current Bucky \u2013 but his eyes were clear and sharp. \u201cYou seem to have the advantage of me,\u201d Bucky said, his gaze flickering over Tony with interest. \u00a0After a moment he must have come to some sort of conclusion because when he slid off the barstool to offer his hand, his smile was lazy but the look in his eyes was definitely\u2026not. <i>Uh-oh</i>, Tony thought, trying to quell the way that look made his pulse quicken. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d he said, automatically reaching out to shake Bucky\u2019s hand. \u00a0It was strong and calloused in his own, gripping for just a moment too long before he let go. Tony blinked rapidly as his entire view of James Buchanan Barnes shifted. \u00a0\u201cI knew it,\u201d Tony blurted. \u201cSteve said you\u2026\u201d At the last minute Tony remembered where and when he was and stopped talking. \u00a0Debating Bucky\u2019s sexual orientation could wait - especially since now he knew he had the trump card in that particular argument, given the fact that Tony hadn\u2019t been so smoothly eye-fucked since college. \u00a0\"You would be here,\u201c Tony finished, praying that he wasn\u2019t so far back in time that Steve was still back in New York, skinny and asthmatic.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re a friend of Steve\u2019s?\u201d Bucky said, sounding only mildly surprised, pulling out the stool next to him as he sat back down. Tony let out a silent breath and told himself to be more careful as he sat down. \u201cHow do you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrough Howard,\u201d Tony said, somewhat honestly. \u00a0\u201cBy reputation, mostly,\u201d he added. \u201cI doubt Steve would remember me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you\u2019re here looking for him, he just left. \u00a0Agent Carter just pulled him out for a\u2026meeting,\u201d he said. \u00a0\u201cSo it\u2019s just you and me,\u201d he continued with a curl of his mouth, taking a sip of his drink.</p><p>\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t, uh, looking for Steve,\u201d Tony said, swallowing thickly, trying not to be distracted by that mouth. \u00a0He realized this was the first time he\u2019d seen Bucky smile; if he did during Tony\u2019s time, it wasn\u2019t while Tony was around. \u00a0Not that he paid a lot of attention to Bucky\u2019s moods or anything, it was just\u2026he had a really nice smile. After a long moment, Tony realized that he was staring at Bucky\u2019s mouth and that the silence had stretched out just a bit too long. \u201cI just needed to get out for a bit, you know?\u201d he said quickly, looking down at the wood of the bar and hoping Bucky hadn\u2019t seen him staring.</p><p>Bucky snorted and nodded like <i>hell yeah, I know</i>. \u201cSo if you know Howard, you\u2019re probably one of those LA types,\u201d he said. \u00a0\u201cThat must be why you talk a little funny. And dress funny,\u201d he added, eyeing Tony, which made him run a hand self-consciously over his shirt. \u00a0He\u2019d been at Stark Industries for a raft of business meetings when the Avengers call had come in, so he had just thrown off his jacket and tie and climbed into his Iron Man suit.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess you could say that,\u201d Tony said. \u00a0When he saw a secret smirk flash across Bucky\u2019s face he suddenly got the sinking feeling that being an \u201cLA type\u201d meant something different in the 40s.</p><p>\u201cWant a drink?\u201d Bucky asked, thankfully changing the subject. \"I\u2019m buying,\u201d which was good because Tony didn\u2019t think this pub took AmEx.</p><p>This is a bad idea. Somewhere in the future Stephen was screaming about Tony messing with the flow of time. \u201cSure,\u201d Tony said anyway. \u00a0A few more minutes wouldn\u2019t hurt, right?</p><p>As Bucky knocked back the finger of whiskey that was left in his glass and gestured to the barkeep, Tony realized that if he wasn\u2019t drunk, he was desperately trying to be. \u00a0Suddenly he realized when and where he was, and he reflexively glanced around the room, looking for the other Howling Commandos. Or rather, the men who had, at some point tonight, just become the Howling Commandos.</p><p>\u201cWere you here to meet someone?\u201d Bucky said, voice suddenly carefully neutral as the bartender set a couple of glasses in front of them.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, no,\u201d Tony said, realizing that Bucky had seen him looking around. \u00a0\u201cI just\u2026thought I recognized someone. From work. Uh, I mean, you know. Howard\u2019s\u2026lab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201c Bucky visibly relaxed at that. \u00a0\"Well, cheers,\u201d he said as he slid Tony\u2019s glass over to him. Tony lifted his glass in acknowledgement and took a sip of his whiskey and almost gagged from the rough burn and sooty aftertaste of cheap whiskey. \u00a0He couldn\u2019t completely suppress a cough, however, and Bucky clapped him on the back, squeezing his shoulder. \u00a0Tony couldn\u2019t suppress the shiver that went down his spine at the contact, even as his eyes were still watering from the rotgut booze. \u00a0He hoped that Bucky wouldn\u2019t notice, but from the hooded look in his eyes he definitely did.</p><p>\u201cIf you spend a lot of time with Howard I imagine you\u2019re probably used to the good stuff,\u201d Bucky said with a half-smile. \u00a0\u201cDrink enough of it and you get used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d Tony said hoarsely, trying not to notice the way Bucky\u2019s long-fingered hands were cradling his glass as he took a drink. \u00a0\"Or maybe your taste buds just shrivel up and die.\u201d God, the burn and taste got <i>worse</i> the longer it lingered, so he took another sip just to stop it.</p><p>Bucky snorted. \u00a0\"I\u2019m in the Army, my taste buds died a long time ago.\u201c There was that smile again, Tony thought helplessly, suddenly seized by the need to see him laugh. \u201cSo what do you do for Howard?\u201d Bucky asked. \u00a0\"I\u2019ve been to his lab once or twice and I would definitely remember seeing you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI build things. \u00a0Help him design missiles and\u2026stuff.\u201d \u00a0Despite his best efforts he kept losing his train of thought whenever he caught Bucky\u2019s gaze. \u00a0The look in his eyes \u2013 along with the rotgut whiskey \u2013 was making heat curl through Tony\u2019s veins. \u00a0He\u2019d never admit it, least of all to Steve or God forbid, Bucky himself, but he had fantasized about Bucky looking at him just like this. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s all classified,\u201d Tony finished, before he said too much. \u00a0He took a deep breath, let it out slowly, and took another sip of whiskey.</p><p>\u201cThe last day I was in the States I went to the Stark Expo,\u201d Bucky said, smiling ruefully down into his drink. \u00a0\u201cDid you know him then? \u00a0With the-\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlying car?\u201d Tony said with a groaning laugh. \u00a0Howard had always hated it when people brought up the flying car. \u201cKinda. I\u2019m perfecting the repulsor technology, but he eventually gave up on the car idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad,\u201d Bucky said. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019d like to fly something like that one day. Flying car or a jet pack or something. \u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Tony made a thoughtful noise, wondering if that were true of future Bucky too, or if idle dreams like flying had been burned out of him by Hydra. \u201cSo, uh, what brings you here?\u201d he tried, trying to deflect the conversation away from himself.</p><p>Bucky shrugged, mouth twisting. \u00a0\u201cYou know, just\u2026trying to relax. \u00a0Let off some steam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how\u2019s that going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty good so far,\u201d Bucky said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m feeling optimistic for the rest of the night,\u201d he added, glancing at Tony out of the corner of his eye as he took a sip of his whiskey. \u00a0Tony felt his ears get hot like he was a teenager again. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how long I\u2019m going to be in town for,\u201d he said, trying to quell the situation, but when Bucky smirked and Tony listened to himself, he wanted to bang his head on the bar. \u00a0Tony took another swallow of the whiskey as punishment for running his mouth and grimaced at the taste, even as it made his fingertips tingle. \u00a0Apparently his subconscious was trying to talk him into doing something extremely stupid. Stephen was going to be so angry at him.</p><p>\u201cWell, these days, who is, right? \u00a0Don\u2019t know if you heard, but there\u2019s a war on. That\u2019s why you gotta carpe that diem.\u201d Bucky leaned over and tapped his almost empty glass against Tony\u2019s half-full one.</p><p>\u201cMore like <i>cave</i> that <i>virum</i>,\u201d Tony muttered to himself. He eyed the glass and Bucky, wondering just how many he\u2019d had already. \u00a0Looks like the super-soldier serum, knockoff though it may have been, was already affecting his metabolism. There was a sudden clamor from the next room and Bucky\u2019s head whipped up, looking a little wild around the edges. \u00a0It was just a moment, a second even, but it was enough to show how thin Bucky\u2019s easy-going veneer was. \u00a0When he saw Tony watching him, he tried to cover it with a smile but Tony could see how tight his shoulders were when he finished off his glass of whiskey. \u201cLook, I know what you\u2019ve been through,\u201d Tony said quietly. \u201cWhat you\u2019re going through.\u201d</p><p>Bucky laughed harshly, pushing his glass away and nodding at the bartender for another. \u201cOf course you do, the whole Western front knows, it\u2019s been in all the papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean I <i>know</i>,\u201d Tony repeated. \u201cI was \u2013 was captured too. And-\u201d Tony forced himself to say the word, though it was heavy and tasted like ash, \u201c-tortured. Not by Hydra. I was, uh, in the Middle East before I came here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Bucky stared at him, face unreadable. \u201cIs that why you came up to me? You thought we would be buddies because we, whaddyacallit, have some shared life experiences?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tony protested, running a hand through his hair. \u00a0\u201cI mean\u2026what I\u2019m trying to say is that when I came back and everyone knew, they all stared at me, as if they were just waiting for me to, I dunno, start crying or freaking out or something. It was so goddamn aggravating that I started avoiding people I knew so I wouldn\u2019t have to see that\u2026<i>look</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know that fucking look.\u201d \u00a0The bartender came over to top up his glass but this time Bucky just toyed with it instead of drinking.</p><p>Tony took another sip of his own, noting with relief that his glass was almost empty. \u00a0It was strange, talking to this\u2026version of Bucky. This man looked like he had just got out of hell, sure, but he didn\u2019t seem haunted by his past in the same way that Future Bucky was, weary and wary and tired. \u00a0He seemed lighter, somehow, even though the memories of Azzano must still be fresh.</p><p>Tony drained his glass. Thinking of Azzano was reminding him of Afghanistan, so he forced his thoughts back to the present. The past. Whatever. \u201cHey, when you finish that, wanna take a walk?\u201d he asked suddenly, the noisy crowd of the bar starting to seem grating instead of welcoming.</p><p>In his defense, when he said the words he really did <i>mean</i> just a walk, but when Bucky\u2019s eyebrows went up and his eyes grew hooded and dark, smile knowing, Tony realized his mouth had run away with him again. \u201cSure,\u201d Bucky drawled. \u00a0\"If you\u2019re in a hurry, let\u2019s go.\u201c \u00a0He drained his glass and put some money underneath it before sliding off the bar stool.</p>",

Catch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bucky said in alarm, hands scrambling for a grip on Tony\u2019s armor. \u201cNo, don\u2019t-\u201d</p><p>Tony rapidly adjusted his trajectory upwards and threw Bucky as hard as he could at Thor, who turned to look just in time to get sideswiped by two-hundred pounds of angry supersoldier.</p><p>\u201cSir, the light-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Bucky make it?\u201d Tony couldn\u2019t tell, the HUD was flickering as all power was diverted to his repulsors. \u201cIs everyone else-\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOwwww,\u201d Tony said, his aching body dragging him back into unwelcoming consciousness. He tried to move but couldn\u2019t; something was weighing his limbs down. \u00a0He opened his eyes and started to panic when all he saw was blackness. \u201cWhat-\u201d He tried to move again, straining against whatever was holding him, then finally the smell of metal, grease, and hydraulic fluid registered and he realized was in his suit. \u00a0The complete and utter blackness, though, even the lack of indicator lights, meant that somehow, despite all of his backups and failsafes, the suit was completely dead.</p>[[MORE]]<p>He closed his eyes and forced himself to relax, taking long breaths in to the count of five and then letting them out slowly, trying very deliberately to not think about the amount of air left in his suit. \u00a0Then he laboriously lifted one hand and fumbled for the emergency catch, hands slipping before he could finally dig the thick metal fingers of the gauntlet into the hidden lever.</p><p>Finally it clicked and the whole suit split open and folded away from him, leaving him gasping gratefully for air and sitting up, stumbling away from the claustrophobic nightmare of a dead suit. \u00a0He rubbed his arms against the slight chill, trying to get his bearings. It was night-time, which was\u2026different, since it had been daytime before. \u00a0He was clearly still in London, though, so\u2026the green light must have killed his suit, but why in the hell would his team leave him lying in it long enough for it to get dark? Unless they couldn\u2019t find him, but Tony had a beacon with a separate battery backup for just that purpose.</p><p>He edged carefully out of the alley he was in to the street, finding it strangely dark and deserted. \u00a0He didn\u2019t have a cell phone or his watch, so he had no idea what time it was, but even the streetlights were dark, which didn\u2019t make any sense no matter what goddamn time it was.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t panic,\u201d Tony told himself sternly, and went to go sit next to his suit. By the dim light of the moon and stars he pried into the metal plating and realized to his dismay that the battery backup was mysteriously dead, too. \u00a0\u201cStill not a good time to panic,\u201d he reminded himself, even though he could feel his heart starting to race. \u00a0He sat for a little while longer, concentrating on the chill of the paving bricks under him, the damp edge in the air, and the familiar feeling of his suit under his fingertips, until his heart calmed. \u00a0Once he felt steadier he stood and dragged the suit behind a pile of rubble, partially disassembling it so it looked less like a robot and more like a pile of scrap metal. \u00a0Then he rubbed his hands together, and started walking even though he was sorely tempted to stay right where he was until the comforting light of dawn.</p><p>The street was still eerily dark and still until a door opened down a side street and light and noise spilled out of it. \u00a0Tony headed eagerly in that direction, slipping gratefully through the door that promised people and perhaps answers, then stopped dead once he was inside.</p><p><i>Movie set</i>, he thought wildly, staring wide-eyed at the crowd of soldiers in front of him, wearing uniforms that were straight out of World War II. \u00a0Someone came in behind him and jostled him out of the doorway, so he edged around the room, more unwilling to face the eerily deserted street than he was to find a deserted corner of this odd bar and its odder clientele and try to figure out how in the hell he got zapped back to World War II.</p><p>Well, actually, that was probably the least of the mysteries. \u00a0Stephen\u2019s bizarre green light was obviously the cause of that. The Avengers had been called to help him with an assault on the London Sanctuary, and the Mystical Morons of whatever who had been fighting them had obviously set off some sort of time trap that only Tony had been lucky enough to get caught in. The real questions were, how long was he going to be stuck here before Stephen found him and what in the hell was he going to do with himself until then?</p><p>Tony made his way through the soldiers, trying to find an empty seat from which he could figure out the answers to these burning questions, when the flash of a familiar profile made him pause.</p><p>Was that\u2026Tony edged closer and looked again, and sure enough, it was. \u201cBucky?\u201d he said in surprise and winced. Goddammit, Stephen was going to yell at him for this.</p><p>Bucky looked up from his drink, glancing around the bar before he caught Tony\u2019s eyes. \u00a0He looked like he should be drunk, short dark hair askew like he\u2019d been running his fingers through it, his shirt and coat partially unbuttoned, and stubble darkening his jaw \u2013 clearly Past Bucky gave as much of a shit about rules as Current Bucky \u2013 but his eyes were clear and sharp. \u201cYou seem to have the advantage of me,\u201d Bucky said, his gaze flickering over Tony with interest. \u00a0After a moment he must have come to some sort of conclusion because when he slid off the barstool to offer his hand, his smile was lazy but the look in his eyes was definitely\u2026not. <i>Uh-oh</i>, Tony thought, trying to quell the way that look made his pulse quicken. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d he said, automatically reaching out to shake Bucky\u2019s hand. \u00a0It was strong and calloused in his own, gripping for just a moment too long before he let go. Tony blinked rapidly as his entire view of James Buchanan Barnes shifted. \u00a0\u201cI knew it,\u201d Tony blurted. \u201cSteve said you\u2026\u201d At the last minute Tony remembered where and when he was and stopped talking. \u00a0Debating Bucky\u2019s sexual orientation could wait - especially since now he knew he had the trump card in that particular argument, given the fact that Tony hadn\u2019t been so smoothly eye-fucked since college. \u00a0\"You would be here,\u201c Tony finished, praying that he wasn\u2019t so far back in time that Steve was still back in New York, skinny and asthmatic.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re a friend of Steve\u2019s?\u201d Bucky said, sounding only mildly surprised, pulling out the stool next to him as he sat back down. Tony let out a silent breath and told himself to be more careful as he sat down. \u201cHow do you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrough Howard,\u201d Tony said, somewhat honestly. \u00a0\u201cBy reputation, mostly,\u201d he added. \u201cI doubt Steve would remember me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you\u2019re here looking for him, he just left. \u00a0Agent Carter just pulled him out for a\u2026meeting,\u201d he said. \u00a0\u201cSo it\u2019s just you and me,\u201d he continued with a curl of his mouth, taking a sip of his drink.</p><p>\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t, uh, looking for Steve,\u201d Tony said, swallowing thickly, trying not to be distracted by that mouth. \u00a0He realized this was the first time he\u2019d seen Bucky smile; if he did during Tony\u2019s time, it wasn\u2019t while Tony was around. \u00a0Not that he paid a lot of attention to Bucky\u2019s moods or anything, it was just\u2026he had a really nice smile. After a long moment, Tony realized that he was staring at Bucky\u2019s mouth and that the silence had stretched out just a bit too long. \u201cI just needed to get out for a bit, you know?\u201d he said quickly, looking down at the wood of the bar and hoping Bucky hadn\u2019t seen him staring.</p><p>Bucky snorted and nodded like <i>hell yeah, I know</i>. \u201cSo if you know Howard, you\u2019re probably one of those LA types,\u201d he said. \u00a0\u201cThat must be why you talk a little funny. And dress funny,\u201d he added, eyeing Tony, which made him run a hand self-consciously over his shirt. \u00a0He\u2019d been at Stark Industries for a raft of business meetings when the Avengers call had come in, so he had just thrown off his jacket and tie and climbed into his Iron Man suit.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess you could say that,\u201d Tony said. \u00a0When he saw a secret smirk flash across Bucky\u2019s face he suddenly got the sinking feeling that being an \u201cLA type\u201d meant something different in the 40s.</p><p>\u201cWant a drink?\u201d Bucky asked, thankfully changing the subject. \"I\u2019m buying,\u201d which was good because Tony didn\u2019t think this pub took AmEx.</p><p>This is a bad idea. Somewhere in the future Stephen was screaming about Tony messing with the flow of time. \u201cSure,\u201d Tony said anyway. \u00a0A few more minutes wouldn\u2019t hurt, right?</p><p>As Bucky knocked back the finger of whiskey that was left in his glass and gestured to the barkeep, Tony realized that if he wasn\u2019t drunk, he was desperately trying to be. \u00a0Suddenly he realized when and where he was, and he reflexively glanced around the room, looking for the other Howling Commandos. Or rather, the men who had, at some point tonight, just become the Howling Commandos.</p><p>\u201cWere you here to meet someone?\u201d Bucky said, voice suddenly carefully neutral as the bartender set a couple of glasses in front of them.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, no,\u201d Tony said, realizing that Bucky had seen him looking around. \u00a0\u201cI just\u2026thought I recognized someone. From work. Uh, I mean, you know. Howard\u2019s\u2026lab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201c Bucky visibly relaxed at that. \u00a0\"Well, cheers,\u201d he said as he slid Tony\u2019s glass over to him. Tony lifted his glass in acknowledgement and took a sip of his whiskey and almost gagged from the rough burn and sooty aftertaste of cheap whiskey. \u00a0He couldn\u2019t completely suppress a cough, however, and Bucky clapped him on the back, squeezing his shoulder. \u00a0Tony couldn\u2019t suppress the shiver that went down his spine at the contact, even as his eyes were still watering from the rotgut booze. \u00a0He hoped that Bucky wouldn\u2019t notice, but from the hooded look in his eyes he definitely did.</p><p>\u201cIf you spend a lot of time with Howard I imagine you\u2019re probably used to the good stuff,\u201d Bucky said with a half-smile. \u00a0\u201cDrink enough of it and you get used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d Tony said hoarsely, trying not to notice the way Bucky\u2019s long-fingered hands were cradling his glass as he took a drink. \u00a0\"Or maybe your taste buds just shrivel up and die.\u201d God, the burn and taste got <i>worse</i> the longer it lingered, so he took another sip just to stop it.</p><p>Bucky snorted. \u00a0\"I\u2019m in the Army, my taste buds died a long time ago.\u201c There was that smile again, Tony thought helplessly, suddenly seized by the need to see him laugh. \u201cSo what do you do for Howard?\u201d Bucky asked. \u00a0\"I\u2019ve been to his lab once or twice and I would definitely remember seeing you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI build things. \u00a0Help him design missiles and\u2026stuff.\u201d \u00a0Despite his best efforts he kept losing his train of thought whenever he caught Bucky\u2019s gaze. \u00a0The look in his eyes \u2013 along with the rotgut whiskey \u2013 was making heat curl through Tony\u2019s veins. \u00a0He\u2019d never admit it, least of all to Steve or God forbid, Bucky himself, but he had fantasized about Bucky looking at him just like this. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s all classified,\u201d Tony finished, before he said too much. \u00a0He took a deep breath, let it out slowly, and took another sip of whiskey.</p><p>\u201cThe last day I was in the States I went to the Stark Expo,\u201d Bucky said, smiling ruefully down into his drink. \u00a0\u201cDid you know him then? \u00a0With the-\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlying car?\u201d Tony said with a groaning laugh. \u00a0Howard had always hated it when people brought up the flying car. \u201cKinda. I\u2019m perfecting the repulsor technology, but he eventually gave up on the car idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad,\u201d Bucky said. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019d like to fly something like that one day. Flying car or a jet pack or something. \u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Tony made a thoughtful noise, wondering if that were true of future Bucky too, or if idle dreams like flying had been burned out of him by Hydra. \u201cSo, uh, what brings you here?\u201d he tried, trying to deflect the conversation away from himself.</p><p>Bucky shrugged, mouth twisting. \u00a0\u201cYou know, just\u2026trying to relax. \u00a0Let off some steam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how\u2019s that going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty good so far,\u201d Bucky said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m feeling optimistic for the rest of the night,\u201d he added, glancing at Tony out of the corner of his eye as he took a sip of his whiskey. \u00a0Tony felt his ears get hot like he was a teenager again. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how long I\u2019m going to be in town for,\u201d he said, trying to quell the situation, but when Bucky smirked and Tony listened to himself, he wanted to bang his head on the bar. \u00a0Tony took another swallow of the whiskey as punishment for running his mouth and grimaced at the taste, even as it made his fingertips tingle. \u00a0Apparently his subconscious was trying to talk him into doing something extremely stupid. Stephen was going to be so angry at him.</p><p>\u201cWell, these days, who is, right? \u00a0Don\u2019t know if you heard, but there\u2019s a war on. That\u2019s why you gotta carpe that diem.\u201d Bucky leaned over and tapped his almost empty glass against Tony\u2019s half-full one.</p><p>\u201cMore like <i>cave</i> that <i>virum</i>,\u201d Tony muttered to himself. He eyed the glass and Bucky, wondering just how many he\u2019d had already. \u00a0Looks like the super-soldier serum, knockoff though it may have been, was already affecting his metabolism. There was a sudden clamor from the next room and Bucky\u2019s head whipped up, looking a little wild around the edges. \u00a0It was just a moment, a second even, but it was enough to show how thin Bucky\u2019s easy-going veneer was. \u00a0When he saw Tony watching him, he tried to cover it with a smile but Tony could see how tight his shoulders were when he finished off his glass of whiskey. \u201cLook, I know what you\u2019ve been through,\u201d Tony said quietly. \u201cWhat you\u2019re going through.\u201d</p><p>Bucky laughed harshly, pushing his glass away and nodding at the bartender for another. \u201cOf course you do, the whole Western front knows, it\u2019s been in all the papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean I <i>know</i>,\u201d Tony repeated. \u201cI was \u2013 was captured too. And-\u201d Tony forced himself to say the word, though it was heavy and tasted like ash, \u201c-tortured. Not by Hydra. I was, uh, in the Middle East before I came here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Bucky stared at him, face unreadable. \u201cIs that why you came up to me? You thought we would be buddies because we, whaddyacallit, have some shared life experiences?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tony protested, running a hand through his hair. \u00a0\u201cI mean\u2026what I\u2019m trying to say is that when I came back and everyone knew, they all stared at me, as if they were just waiting for me to, I dunno, start crying or freaking out or something. It was so goddamn aggravating that I started avoiding people I knew so I wouldn\u2019t have to see that\u2026<i>look</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know that fucking look.\u201d \u00a0The bartender came over to top up his glass but this time Bucky just toyed with it instead of drinking.</p><p>Tony took another sip of his own, noting with relief that his glass was almost empty. \u00a0It was strange, talking to this\u2026version of Bucky. This man looked like he had just got out of hell, sure, but he didn\u2019t seem haunted by his past in the same way that Future Bucky was, weary and wary and tired. \u00a0He seemed lighter, somehow, even though the memories of Azzano must still be fresh.</p><p>Tony drained his glass. Thinking of Azzano was reminding him of Afghanistan, so he forced his thoughts back to the present. The past. Whatever. \u201cHey, when you finish that, wanna take a walk?\u201d he asked suddenly, the noisy crowd of the bar starting to seem grating instead of welcoming.</p><p>In his defense, when he said the words he really did <i>mean</i> just a walk, but when Bucky\u2019s eyebrows went up and his eyes grew hooded and dark, smile knowing, Tony realized his mouth had run away with him again. \u201cSure,\u201d Bucky drawled. \u00a0\"If you\u2019re in a hurry, let\u2019s go.\u201c \u00a0He drained his glass and put some money underneath it before sliding off the bar stool.</p>",

Catch!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Bucky said in alarm, hands scrambling for a grip on Tony&rsquo;s armor. &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t-&rdquo;</p><p>Tony rapidly adjusted his trajectory upwards and threw Bucky as hard as he could at Thor, who turned to look just in time to get sideswiped by two-hundred pounds of angry supersoldier.</p><p>&ldquo;Sir, the light-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did Bucky make it?&rdquo; Tony couldn&rsquo;t tell, the HUD was flickering as all power was diverted to his repulsors. &ldquo;Is everyone else-&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Owwww,&rdquo; Tony said, his aching body dragging him back into unwelcoming consciousness. He tried to move but couldn&rsquo;t; something was weighing his limbs down. &nbsp;He opened his eyes and started to panic when all he saw was blackness. &ldquo;What-&rdquo; He tried to move again, straining against whatever was holding him, then finally the smell of metal, grease, and hydraulic fluid registered and he realized was in his suit. &nbsp;The complete and utter blackness, though, even the lack of indicator lights, meant that somehow, despite all of his backups and failsafes, the suit was completely dead.</p><p>He closed his eyes and forced himself to relax, taking long breaths in to the count of five and then letting them out slowly, trying very deliberately to not think about the amount of air left in his suit. &nbsp;Then he laboriously lifted one hand and fumbled for the emergency catch, hands slipping before he could finally dig the thick metal fingers of the gauntlet into the hidden lever.</p><p>Finally it clicked and the whole suit split open and folded away from him, leaving him gasping gratefully for air and sitting up, stumbling away from the claustrophobic nightmare of a dead suit. &nbsp;He rubbed his arms against the slight chill, trying to get his bearings. It was night-time, which was&hellip;different, since it had been daytime before. &nbsp;He was clearly still in London, though, so&hellip;the green light must have killed his suit, but why in the hell would his team leave him lying in it long enough for it to get dark? Unless they couldn&rsquo;t find him, but Tony had a beacon with a separate battery backup for just that purpose.</p><p>He edged carefully out of the alley he was in to the street, finding it strangely dark and deserted. &nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t have a cell phone or his watch, so he had no idea what time it was, but even the streetlights were dark, which didn&rsquo;t make any sense no matter what goddamn time it was.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t panic,&rdquo; Tony told himself sternly, and went to go sit next to his suit. By the dim light of the moon and stars he pried into the metal plating and realized to his dismay that the battery backup was mysteriously dead, too. &nbsp;&ldquo;Still not a good time to panic,&rdquo; he reminded himself, even though he could feel his heart starting to race. &nbsp;He sat for a little while longer, concentrating on the chill of the paving bricks under him, the damp edge in the air, and the familiar feeling of his suit under his fingertips, until his heart calmed. &nbsp;Once he felt steadier he stood and dragged the suit behind a pile of rubble, partially disassembling it so it looked less like a robot and more like a pile of scrap metal. &nbsp;Then he rubbed his hands together, and started walking even though he was sorely tempted to stay right where he was until the comforting light of dawn.</p><p>The street was still eerily dark and still until a door opened down a side street and light and noise spilled out of it. &nbsp;Tony headed eagerly in that direction, slipping gratefully through the door that promised people and perhaps answers, then stopped dead once he was inside.</p><p><i>Movie set</i>, he thought wildly, staring wide-eyed at the crowd of soldiers in front of him, wearing uniforms that were straight out of World War II. &nbsp;Someone came in behind him and jostled him out of the doorway, so he edged around the room, more unwilling to face the eerily deserted street than he was to find a deserted corner of this odd bar and its odder clientele and try to figure out how in the hell he got zapped back to World War II.</p><p>Well, actually, that was probably the least of the mysteries. &nbsp;Stephen&rsquo;s bizarre green light was obviously the cause of that. The Avengers had been called to help him with an assault on the London Sanctuary, and the Mystical Morons of whatever who had been fighting them had obviously set off some sort of time trap that only Tony had been lucky enough to get caught in. The real questions were, how long was he going to be stuck here before Stephen found him and what in the hell was he going to do with himself until then?</p><p>Tony made his way through the soldiers, trying to find an empty seat from which he could figure out the answers to these burning questions, when the flash of a familiar profile made him pause.</p><p>Was that&hellip;Tony edged closer and looked again, and sure enough, it was. &ldquo;Bucky?&rdquo; he said in surprise and winced. Goddammit, Stephen was going to yell at him for this.</p><p>Bucky looked up from his drink, glancing around the bar before he caught Tony&rsquo;s eyes. &nbsp;He looked like he should be drunk, short dark hair askew like he&rsquo;d been running his fingers through it, his shirt and coat partially unbuttoned, and stubble darkening his jaw &ndash; clearly Past Bucky gave as much of a shit about rules as Current Bucky &ndash; but his eyes were clear and sharp. &ldquo;You seem to have the advantage of me,&rdquo; Bucky said, his gaze flickering over Tony with interest. &nbsp;After a moment he must have come to some sort of conclusion because when he slid off the barstool to offer his hand, his smile was lazy but the look in his eyes was definitely&hellip;not. <i>Uh-oh</i>, Tony thought, trying to quell the way that look made his pulse quicken. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve met.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony,&rdquo; he said, automatically reaching out to shake Bucky&rsquo;s hand. &nbsp;It was strong and calloused in his own, gripping for just a moment too long before he let go.

Flying car or a jet pack or something. &rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Tony made a thoughtful noise, wondering if that were true of future Bucky too, or if idle dreams like flying had been burned out of him by Hydra. &ldquo;So, uh, what brings you here?&rdquo; he tried, trying to deflect the conversation away from himself.</p><p>Bucky shrugged, mouth twisting. &nbsp;&ldquo;You know, just&hellip;trying to relax. &nbsp;Let off some steam.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And how&rsquo;s that going?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pretty good so far,&rdquo; Bucky said. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m feeling optimistic for the rest of the night,&rdquo; he added, glancing at Tony out of the corner of his eye as he took a sip of his whiskey. &nbsp;Tony felt his ears get hot like he was a teenager again. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how long I&rsquo;m going to be in town for,&rdquo; he said, trying to quell the situation, but when Bucky smirked and Tony listened to himself, he wanted to bang his head on the bar. &nbsp;Tony took another swallow of the whiskey as punishment for running his mouth and grimaced at the taste, even as it made his fingertips tingle. &nbsp;Apparently his subconscious was trying to talk him into doing something extremely stupid. Stephen was going to be so angry at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, these days, who is, right? &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t know if you heard, but there&rsquo;s a war on. That&rsquo;s why you gotta carpe that diem.&rdquo; Bucky leaned over and tapped his almost empty glass against Tony&rsquo;s half-full one.</p><p>&ldquo;More like <i>cave</i> that <i>virum</i>,&rdquo; Tony muttered to himself. He eyed the glass and Bucky, wondering just how many he&rsquo;d had already. &nbsp;Looks like the super-soldier serum, knockoff though it may have been, was already affecting his metabolism. There was a sudden clamor from the next room and Bucky&rsquo;s head whipped up, looking a little wild around the edges. &nbsp;It was just a moment, a second even, but it was enough to show how thin Bucky&rsquo;s easy-going veneer was. &nbsp;When he saw Tony watching him, he tried to cover it with a smile but Tony could see how tight his shoulders were when he finished off his glass of whiskey. &ldquo;Look, I know what you&rsquo;ve been through,&rdquo; Tony said quietly. &ldquo;What you&rsquo;re going through.&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky laughed harshly, pushing his glass away and nodding at the bartender for another. &ldquo;Of course you do, the whole Western front knows, it&rsquo;s been in all the papers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I mean I <i>know</i>,&rdquo; Tony repeated. &ldquo;I was &ndash; was captured too. And-&rdquo; Tony forced himself to say the word, though it was heavy and tasted like ash, &ldquo;-tortured. Not by Hydra. I was, uh, in the Middle East before I came here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Bucky stared at him, face unreadable. &ldquo;Is that why you came up to me? You thought we would be buddies because we, whaddyacallit, have some shared life experiences?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Tony protested, running a hand through his hair. &nbsp;&ldquo;I mean&hellip;what I&rsquo;m trying to say is that when I came back and everyone knew, they all stared at me, as if they were just waiting for me to, I dunno, start crying or freaking out or something. It was so goddamn aggravating that I started avoiding people I knew so I wouldn&rsquo;t have to see that&hellip;<i>look</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I know that fucking look.&rdquo; &nbsp;The bartender came over to top up his glass but this time Bucky just toyed with it instead of drinking.</p><p>Tony took another sip of his own, noting with relief that his glass was almost empty. &nbsp;It was strange, talking to this&hellip;version of Bucky. This man looked like he had just got out of hell, sure, but he didn&rsquo;t seem haunted by his past in the same way that Future Bucky was, weary and wary and tired. &nbsp;He seemed lighter, somehow, even though the memories of Azzano must still be fresh.</p><p>Tony drained his glass. Thinking of Azzano was reminding him of Afghanistan, so he forced his thoughts back to the present. The past. Whatever. &ldquo;Hey, when you finish that, wanna take a walk?&rdquo; he asked suddenly, the noisy crowd of the bar starting to seem grating instead of welcoming.</p><p>In his defense, when he said the words he really did <i>mean</i> just a walk, but when Bucky&rsquo;s eyebrows went up and his eyes grew hooded and dark, smile knowing, Tony realized his mouth had run away with him again. &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Bucky drawled. &nbsp;\"If you&rsquo;re in a hurry, let&rsquo;s go.&ldquo; &nbsp;He drained his glass and put some money underneath it before sliding off the bar stool.</p>",
