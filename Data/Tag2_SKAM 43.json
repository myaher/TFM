They get along well and it\u2019s just a safe place for him to go back to when things are getting too much in his life. But january is here and he\u2019s about to start at his new school. What he doesn\u2019t expect is to bump into the person he\u2019s been texting with. Suddenly Eliott\u2019s life going upside down as he both tries to approach and avoid Lucas at the same time.</b></p><p><b>Side note: </b><i>I tried to stick to one header pic, but I am just a sucker for making these, so&hellip; yeah</i></p><!-- more --><hr><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Just friends</b></h2><p><br/></p><p>Eliott was obviously expecting people asking questions about him and Lucas, but it still got him off guard when Daphn\u00e9 basically dragged him into the common room. When he finally realized what is happening, he was standing in front of four girls, three of them having sparks in their eyes, while the fourth one, Imane actually kept shooting him questioning looks. The tall boy wanted the ground to swallow him. It took him almost a minute to notice that Lucas was in there also, sitting on a table, eyes fixed on him and a smug little smile appearing on his face. Eliott felt his heart skip a beat. Was it even legal for a closeted gay boy to be this fucking flirtatious?\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo, details!\u201d Daphn\u00e9 claimed, eyes wide and full of excitement, she even leant forward like she wouldn\u2019t hear Eliott\u2019s words otherwise. The boy looked at his friend for help, because he suddenly got really anxious from all the attention directed towards him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThere are no details, Daphy.\u201d Lucas talked, finally taking pity on the older boy, who now sighed in relief, slowly backing off from the girls and towards him.\u00a0\u201cWe were hanging out, end of story.\u201d he shrugged like it was no big deal.<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, since when are you hanging out with strangers and post pictures of them on your insta?\u201d Imane asked, raising her eyebrows and crossing her arms.<br/></p><p>\u201cI never said he\u2019s a stranger.\u201d Lucas replied, also raising his brows.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHow do you two know each other then?\u201d Alexia asked now, dying to get some more information about them. Eliott decided to let the short boy handle the situation, so he just took his place next to him, leaning his hips against the table that he was sitting on.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThrough insta.\u201d he shrugged.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a long story and none of your business anyways.\u201d he continued and scooted just a tiny bit closer to Eliott so his thighs were just next to his left hand. He wasn\u2019t playing fair for sure.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cSo you two are dating?\u201d Daphn\u00e9 finally asked the question that was hanging in the air since Eliott arrived. He didn\u2019t say a word, keeping him to his own decision that he\u2019s going to let Lucas handle this, since these girls were his friends.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWe are just friends.\u201d the short boy answered way too quickly and Eliott could feel his knees nudging his side softly. He looked at him, but he faced forward, staring at the girls in front of them, but a small smile was tugging on his lips.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Eliott added now, turning his head to the girls too.\u00a0\u201cAnd we were just drinking and smoking yesterday, nothing special.\u201d he said, trying to sound as nonchalant as he just could, but it wasn\u2019t easy with the boy next to him slightly moving closer to him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay, cool.\u201d Daphn\u00e9 breathed out, seemingly believing to the boys.\u00a0\u201cIt would be a shame for us girls if the two hottest guy in the school would date each other.\u201d she said smirking to which Imane shot her a disapproving look, while Emma and Alexia laughed.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAre you dumb or what?\u201d the muslim girl asked, still not believing the stupidity of her friend.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Daphn\u00e9 had sheer confusion on her face which now made the boys laugh too.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t say things like that.\u201d Alexia answered between two giggles.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not appropriate.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy? I was being honest.\u201d she mumbled, pouting at her friends sadly.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Daphy. We get what you were trying to say.\u201d Lucas said softly and hopped off the table.\u00a0\u201cI should get going now. You coming?\u201d he looked at Eliott who was still leaning on the table.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d he pushed himself forward, shooting a soft smile at the four girls.\u00a0\u201cSee you later.\u201d he said and followed the short one out of the common room.\u00a0<br/></p><p>When they were far enough, they started laughing. Both of them couldn\u2019t hold it back anymore, because that was just the funniest thing ever. It took them minutes to stop, wiping off tears that spilled out from the heavy laughs and then they looked at each other. Eliott leaned to the lockers behind him, while Lucas was standing in front of him with a big smile on his face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat was fun.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cMore like awkward.\u201d the tall boy sighed, but couldn\u2019t stop smiling.\u00a0\u201cYou have some really nosy friends.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThey are girls, Eliott, of course they are nosy.\u201d he smirked and stepped closer to him. Eliott felt butterflies in his stomach.\u00a0\u201cAnd even if they are my friends, they have no right to ask about us.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo there is <i>us</i> now?\u201d he raised an eyebrow, trying to sound playful, but the look on the other\u2019s face made his heart beat faster.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThere is always <i>us</i>, Eliott.\u201d he almost whispered those words, taking another step forward, being dangerously close to him. He could feel his heartbeat thumping in his ears, making it impossible for him to hear anything, but it was fine, because Lucas was there in front of him. Time seemed to slow down as the short boy placed his hands on the lockers, caging Eliott and raised up on his tiptoes, leaning forward. The tall boy closed his eyes, parting his lips, being ready to be kissed, when the door next to them shot open with a loud bang, startling them out of their little bubble. Lucas smirked at him and just like nothing happened, he ran his fingers over Eliott\u2019s arm while pulling back and walked away.\u00a0\u201cSee you later.\u201d he said over his shoulder and disappeared in the crowd of students.\u00a0<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>It was lunch time and Eliott still couldn\u2019t forget about that almost kiss this morning with Lucas. He tried so hard to forget about it, but his damn mind kept going back, replaying the scene in an endless loop. Just like always, he shared a table with Alex and his friends, but this time he didn\u2019t even try to join their conversation. Not like he didn\u2019t wanted to, but he knew that he would not be able to focus on anything these people say. Also he needed to force himself not to look up and search for a certain pair of blue eyes in the cafeteria.\u00a0</p><p>He got startled when his phone started buzzing in his pocket. Luckily the others were in a deep conversation about something, probably Alex\u2019s party this friday, because he could hear the words\u00a0\u2018hookup\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018getting wasted\u2019. He pulled the device out of his pocket and checked his messages. The amount of self control he had almost wasn\u2019t enough to hold himself back from snapping his head up and look over to Lucas table. This boy is going to be the death of him.\u00a0<br/></p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>Not even a glance at me?\u00a0<br/>I feel offended, sir\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br/>Can\u2019t you just eat in peace?\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>I\u2019m not so hungry<br/>Well, not for food at least\u00a0</p><p>Eliott couldn\u2019t believe the audacity of this kid. And also couldn\u2019t believe his own awkwardness. When did he become the shy, submissive one? He let out a sigh, trying to calm himself down and looked up, his eyes immediately finding those blue pools in the crowd. The self-satisfied smirk on Lucas\u2019 face woke up the alpha inside the tall boy, washing away all the shyness and embarrassment he felt just a few seconds ago.\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br/>Well, I can\u2019t let my sweet hedgehog starve, right?</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>Are you going to the party on friday?\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br/>Depends</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>On what?\u00a0</p><p>Eliott can see the longing in the boy\u2019s eyes as they lock eyes after each text. It\u2019s intense and full of passion. A few weeks ago he was just a depressed pile on his own bed, holding onto his phone like his life depended on it and now he was here with the boy that helped him through his rough phase, basically having sex through eyecontact. A playful smirk creeped up on his face which got answered by wiggling eyebrows from the other boy.\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br/>Depends on how much you want me to go\u00a0</p><p>When he read the message, Lucas head snapped up, a grumpy expression taking over his handsome face, making him look like an actual hedgehog. The tall boy winked at him, just for fun and he rolled his eyes in response. He looked down at his phone now, ready to type the answer, when Yann snatched the device from him with a disapproving look on his face, probably scolding his friend now for not joining their conversation. Eliott had to suppress a laugh and as he brought his gaze back to the table, he noticed that Alex is looking at him with a wide smirk on his face.</p><p>\u201cSo it is Lucas.\u201d he says victoriously, like he just won something.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d he shrugs, but he can\u2019t take off the happy smile that\u2019s plastered to his face thanks to the short boy.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a nice kid.\u201d Alex said and munched on a tomato slice.\u00a0\u201cAnd he is my friend, so don\u2019t fuck this up, okay?\u201d he added on a more serious tone and continued eating his salad.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I could never hurt him.\u201d he said honestly, letting himself a glance towards the younger boy. He was trying to get his phone back from his best friend, while the others laughed at them. It was endearing to watch, especially after Lucas told him how lonely he feels at school. Only if he knew how many people cared for him.\u00a0<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Friday came fairly quickly. He didn\u2019t talk much to Lucas since wednesday, not in person at least. They just couldn\u2019t stop texting each other through the days, it was something that become part of their daily routine. Now he was sitting at the bus stop, waiting while smoking a cigarette. He promised Sofiane that he will join him in the Youth Center to hang out after school. His friend is going to leave to Morocco on saturday noon, so he used all the opportunities to hang out with him. He invited him to Alex\u2019s party too, but he said that he will be busy finishing the packing for the trip, while Idriss happily agreed to go. At least he will have some emotional support, because he was sure he\u2019s going to need it remembering that he will probably have to handle drunk Lucas in real life this time.\u00a0</p><p>When his bus arrived, he put out the remains of his cigarette, throwing it into the trash and getting on. He walked to one of the back doors, grabbing the handlebar, letting other people to take the seats. He preferred to stand anyways, staring out the window as they passed through the busy streets of Paris. His pocket was buzzing once, twice, but he didn\u2019t have time to check, needing to get off the vehicle. The Youth Center was not far from the stop and Sofiane was waiting for him outside. It was still cold, so they didn\u2019t waste much time, getting inside immediately.\u00a0</p><p>Eliott spent most of his time watching his friend dance to different types of music, showing off his amazing skills. He clapped every time a song came to an end, which Sofiane thanked with a bright smile. It was nice to spend some alone time with his friend and he definitely gonna miss him once he leaves, especially now that he is constantly on an emotional rollercoaster thanks to Lucas. Of course he still had Idriss, but he wasn\u2019t really good at giving advice, especially when it came to dating.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"525\" data-orig-width=\"399\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/be7cc85b8ea2e97261870914715db429/tumblr_inline_prl57uzgK51rl818h_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"525\" data-orig-width=\"399\"/></figure><p>When Sofiane was done with the practice, he took a shower. Eliott waited for him patiently, posting the picture he took on instagram. Since he revealed his face to Lucas, he decided to share his nice moments there, not to show it to people, but to let himself go back maybe years later and remember what he was doing on this day. After he finished with the uploading, he noticed that he had a few unread messages, so he opened his DMs and wasn\u2019t even surprised to see Lucas\u2019 username on the top.\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>What should I wear tonight?\u00a0<br/>Okay, you are ignoring me, that\u2019s fine\u00a0<br/>Instagram user srodulv, go fuck yourself\u00a0</p><p>There was a ten minute difference between the first two messages, while the last one was sent just afew minutes ago, two hours after the others. Eliott couldn\u2019t hold back a snort. His little hedgehog was so damn impatient, but that was one thing he liked in him.\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br/>You sure you want me to go fuck myself and not someone else?\u00a0</p><p>He let out a soft laugh when the respond came in less than a minute later. His sweet boy was probably checking his phone instantly.</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>Don\u2019t you dare flirting with me now\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br/>Wear something tight\u00a0<br/>You look good in blue</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>I\u2019m going to wear black<br/>Ready for your funeral\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br/>Ouch<br/>That hurt</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>You deserved it\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br/>I am spending time with my friend, just so you know\u00a0<br/>He\u2019s leaving to Morocco tomorrow for a whole month\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>Oh&hellip;</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br/>See you on the party tonight, you grumpy hedgehog\u00a0\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\n\n</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>Yeah, see you\u00a0\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\n\n</p><p>\u201cAre you talking to your boy?\u201d Sofiane snapped him out of staring at his phone. He looked up to see his friend all dressed to his street clothes, bag in his hand, jacket on his shoulder, ready to leave.<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d he answered and got up from the bench where he was sitting, both of them put on their jackets now, walking outside.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHow are things going with him?\u201d his friend asked curiously.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s going to give me a heart attack sooner or later.\u201d Eliott sighed and smiled at his friend, telling him about their time spent at his apartment, then the almost kiss at school the next morning. Sofiane listened carefully, sometimes nodding or flashing a little smirk, but he didn\u2019t ask questions until he was done talking.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWow, that kid has no chill.\u201d he laughed.\u00a0\u201cAnd you say he\u2019s a closeted gay guy?\u201d he asked which Eliott answered with a nod.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s either very bold or totally gone for you.\u201d he added smirking, making his friend blush slightly.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d Eliott asked, not being sure about Lucas\u2019 intentions still. He wasn\u2019t really experienced with boys and maybe he just saw the opportunity to have his first attempts with someone like Eliott. Someone that would do anything to kiss those cherry lips.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI mean&hellip; I know nothing about being gay or anything, but believe me, love makes you do stupid things.\u201d he explained and opened the door to their favorite coffee place now, letting his friend to walk in first. Eliott smiled softly as he entered the building, sitting down to their usual table.\u00a0<br/></p><p>They ordered coffee and cakes while talking about random things. Eliott tried to avoid thinking about Lucas or the upcoming party. Instead he kept asking his friend about the trip to Morocco, about his parents and what he\u2019s going to do once he arrives. He was demanding pictures of course, since Eliott was an artist, he loved exotic countries and Sofiane had quite a talent in making beautiful pictures of landscapes.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"602\" data-orig-width=\"399\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f5ba6b3d5e250c44a0240282f812594b/tumblr_inline_prl7jdekv61rl818h_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"602\" data-orig-width=\"399\"/></figure><p>Eliott just rolled his eyes when he saw the post Sofiane tagged him in. They were standing in the bus stop now, waiting for their ride home. The brunette still had time until the party even though they spent more than an hour at the coffee shop. It was just hard to get separated from Sofiane, since he was such a sunshne and always made him feel warm inside. But both of them had things to do and therefore separating was inevitable.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou seriously had to post that picture?\u201d he asked, glancing at his friend while he replied to Idriss\u2019 idiot comment.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you like it?\u201d he raised his eyebrows.\u00a0\u201cI can finally share pictures of you on social media, because you are not hiding from that cute boy of yours. I wanted to use the opportunity to show off my best friend.\u201d he said with a wide smile and bumped his shoulder to Eliott\u2019s.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d said the other laughing, but he was actually flattered by the kind words.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Eliott\u2019s bus arrived first and he got an annoyed growling from the driver, because he was hugging his friend for too long and the bus was still waiting. Sofiane gently shoved him towards the vehicle, so he got on, waving as they left the stop. It was horrible to think about how he\u2019s not gonna be able to just call him or appear at his doorstep randomly when he\u2019s not feeling well. Yes, he had Idriss and even Alex, but they weren\u2019t the same. He knew Sofiane since a long time now, he was there when he discovered his mental illness, when he broke up with Lucille and fell deep into depression. He was helping him to get through the rough days while not forcing him to talk or do something he didn\u2019t wanted to. It was hard to admit, but he was scared without Sofiane.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>He arrived to Alex\u2019s house a bit later than Idriss, so he just walked in, hugged their host when he greeted him in the hallway and decided to head towards the kitchen. He needed to drink something to down his fears. He was being like a pathetic child who\u2019s crying after his mom in kindergarten. Sofiane won\u2019t be away for long and they will keep in touch anyways.\u00a0</p><p>When he steps into the kitchen, he is struck by the beauty of the boy called Lucas Lallemant. He is there with his friends, sharing what probably is a joint judging by its smell. He is wearing tight, black pants and a button up jean shirt, looking like an angel with his disheveled hair. Eliott blinks once, twice and he feels like the air got punched out of his lungs when the boy\u2019s deep blue eyes find his, staring at him while he holds the joint between his lips lazily. He let out a thick cloud of smoke as he passed the blunt to his friends, not taking his eyes off Eliott. Thankfully the other three was too busy glancing at the dancing crowd in the living room, talking about hot girls.\u00a0</p><p>Lucas now decided to hop up on the kitchen counter with a simple and smooth movement. He kept looking at Eliott, raising his eyebrows, challenging the tall boy to approach him and let\u2019s be honest, he had no intentions to stay away, since he looked so charming just dangling his legs like a kid as he was sitting on the counter. His smile grew bigger when Eliott walked into the kitchen, nodding to the trio that was still rambling about girls.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d he greeted them, which draw all of their attention to the tall boy. The blonde one, Arthur seemed to be a bit shocked and maybe even stunned by the presence of the older boy, while Yann flashed him a smile. Basile was just utterly confused and maybe a bit upset that someone interrupted their chick-talk.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHey, dude.\u201d Yann said, reaching out his hand, which Eliott took gladly, shaking it.\u00a0\u201cEliott, right?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess you\u2019ve heard of me.\u201d he smiled and felt proud that Lucas\u2019 best friend knew who he was, so this meant that he talked to his gang about him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWait, are you the guy from Lucas\u2019 insta?\u201d Basile asked with sudden interest and his eyes widened.\u00a0\u201cWow, you are fucking handsome.\u201d he gasped, mouth agape and he let out an unpleasant whine when Arthur hit his side with his elbow. Eliott laughed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBaz, how about you shut up?\u201d came a soft voice from behind the tall boy, it was a bit deep from all the smoking and Eliott just loved that. He turned around, flashing a charming smile at the short boy, who was still sitting on the counter, balancing his body on his hands behind him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d the tall boy said with a playful smirk, enjoying the sparkles that appeared in Lucas\u2019 ocean blue irises.<br/></p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d he chimed, holding out his hands now, confusing Eliott for a second before he spoke again.\u00a0\u201cGive me that, Arthur.\u201d he asked gently and the blonde one reached out his hand, passing the joint to the brunette now, who held it between his fingers carefully.\u00a0\u201cYou know how to smoke, Eliott?\u201d he asked with a cheeky smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Eliott answered, gladly participating in this little flirtatious game the other was playing. He could hear the gasp of Lucas\u2019 friends behind him, but he couldn\u2019t care less. When the boy waved his hand to him, he walked closer, stopping just a step away from him, his knees were slightly brushing Eliott\u2019s sides.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou wanna share this with me?\u201d the short one asked playing with the joint in his hands. Eliott smiled, placing his hands on the counter, dangerously close to the boy\u2019s thighs and leant forward. Their faces were in the same height like this, which was pretty intriguing.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d he muttered, his ear slowly closed out the thumping of the music and the shocked noises that came from behind them.\u00a0<br/></p><p>No words needed Lucas took a long drag from the blunt, throwing the remains into the sink. He kept the smoke in as he leant forward, Eliott mirroring his movements until their foreheads touched. He felt a soft, warm hand grabbing the back of his head, deep blue eyes staring at him in anticipation. His heart was threatening to break out of his chest, splashing onto the other boy\u2019s shirt in excitement. He gently parted his lips, which was more than enough for the short boy to make a move, blowing out the smoke for him to inhale. He closed his eyes, feeling his head going dizzy and not because of the weed. He let it to fill his mouth, hit him a little before he let it out too. He was glad that Lucas didn\u2019t pull back, keeping their foreheads touching, still looking into his eyes with clear desire. As he swallowed, finally getting the bravery to move forward and kiss the boy, two girls crashed into the kitchen, right next to the boys, startling them out of their little bubble. Eliott started to think that the universe just won\u2019t let them fucking kiss even once.\u00a0</p><p>He felt his stomach churn when the gagging noises reached his ears, which came from the girl that had her head fully in the sink, while the other was helding her hair and scolding her for drinking so much. Eliott recognized the one that wasn\u2019t puking, it was Chlo\u00e9, the girl that interrupted their first interraction at the bus stop just a week ago. Before he could react, he felt a warm body slightly brushing to his as Lucas slipped off the counter, sliding his hands over Eliott\u2019s stomach, just an inch away from his crotch as he walked to the living room, followed by his friends. The tall boy was standing there with a dumbfounded expression on his face, spinning around on his heels, searching the crowd for a crazy crown of hair and a pair of blue eyes, but he couldn\u2019t find him. Meanwhile the unpleasant noises coming from the suffering girl seemed to never stop, just like the slight screams from the supporting friend.\u00a0</p><p>After taking a few deep breaths, he left the kitchen, heading towards the exit. He felt like he have to leave before anything triggers him. The music was already too loud in his ears, his heartbeat wasn\u2019t slowing down and his head was still spinning like a merry-go-round on steroids. The fresh air hit him like a truck, but it was much better than the smell of sweat, alcohol and smoke that was filling his lungs inside. He felt his knees going weak as he thought back about the moment he shared with Lucas in the kitchen.\u00a0</p><p>He couldn\u2019t remember how he got home, all of his memories was blurry, like he was drunk, but he had never been more sober. He hated his mental state and that he needed to leave instead of hunting down that beautiful boy to finally get the kiss he was deprived of twice so far. He knew it was because he kept forgetting to take his meds, that\u2019s why things were affecting him so greatly, why his mood was swinging so often without any reason actually.\u00a0</p><p>An hour passed by and he was laying on the couch like the disaster he was, still fighting down his anxiety. <b><i>Sure, Eliott, that is what Lucas needs, a guy that freaks out after shotgunning and leaving the scene right away. Dream boyfriend.</i></b>\u00a0He sighed at his own thoughts and tried to push the negativity into the back of his head, when his phone was dinging, alerting him of a new message. He checked it and his heart melted when he saw the username.</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>I can\u2019t find you anywhere\u00a0<br/>Is everything okay?\u00a0<br/>Are you still at the party?\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br/>No, I had to come home<br/>I wasn\u2019t feeling good</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>Did I do something bad?\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br/>No, you did everything good<br/></p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>You should have heard the boys, they were going crazy on me\u00a0<br/></p><p><b>srodulv</b><br/>That was definitely one outstanding coming out for sure\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b>\u00a0<br/>Seems like I can\u2019t control myself around you\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br/>Not like I have anything against that\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>Too bad we got interrupted</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br/>Maybe next time we shouldn\u2019t do things like that in public</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>You know, I\u2019m getting tired of waiting for you to ask me out on a date<br/>So I\u2019ll do myself</p><p>Eliott could feel a bright smile making its appearance on his face as he read the latest messages.</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br/>Sounds good to me\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>Sunday, 11h?\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br/>Perfect \u2764\ufe0f\n\n</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>You jerk\u00a0\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\n\n</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><hr><p><i>Next time comes the first date of the boys!

When he finally realized what is happening, he was standing in front of four girls, three of them having sparks in their eyes, while the fourth one, Imane actually kept shooting him questioning looks. The tall boy wanted the ground to swallow him. It took him almost a minute to notice that Lucas was in there also, sitting on a table, eyes fixed on him and a smug little smile appearing on his face. Eliott felt his heart skip a beat. Was it even legal for a closeted gay boy to be this fucking flirtatious?\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo, details!\u201d Daphn\u00e9 claimed, eyes wide and full of excitement, she even leant forward like she wouldn\u2019t hear Eliott\u2019s words otherwise. The boy looked at his friend for help, because he suddenly got really anxious from all the attention directed towards him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThere are no details, Daphy.\u201d Lucas talked, finally taking pity on the older boy, who now sighed in relief, slowly backing off from the girls and towards him.\u00a0\u201cWe were hanging out, end of story.\u201d he shrugged like it was no big deal.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, since when are you hanging out with strangers and post pictures of them on your insta?\u201d Imane asked, raising her eyebrows and crossing her arms.<br></p><p>\u201cI never said he\u2019s a stranger.\u201d Lucas replied, also raising his brows.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHow do you two know each other then?\u201d Alexia asked now, dying to get some more information about them. Eliott decided to let the short boy handle the situation, so he just took his place next to him, leaning his hips against the table that he was sitting on.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThrough insta.\u201d he shrugged.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a long story and none of your business anyways.\u201d he continued and scooted just a tiny bit closer to Eliott so his thighs were just next to his left hand. He wasn\u2019t playing fair for sure.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSo you two are dating?\u201d Daphn\u00e9 finally asked the question that was hanging in the air since Eliott arrived. He didn\u2019t say a word, keeping him to his own decision that he\u2019s going to let Lucas handle this, since these girls were his friends.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWe are just friends.\u201d the short boy answered way too quickly and Eliott could feel his knees nudging his side softly. He looked at him, but he faced forward, staring at the girls in front of them, but a small smile was tugging on his lips.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Eliott added now, turning his head to the girls too.\u00a0\u201cAnd we were just drinking and smoking yesterday, nothing special.\u201d he said, trying to sound as nonchalant as he just could, but it wasn\u2019t easy with the boy next to him slightly moving closer to him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOkay, cool.\u201d Daphn\u00e9 breathed out, seemingly believing to the boys.\u00a0\u201cIt would be a shame for us girls if the two hottest guy in the school would date each other.\u201d she said smirking to which Imane shot her a disapproving look, while Emma and Alexia laughed.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAre you dumb or what?\u201d the muslim girl asked, still not believing the stupidity of her friend.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Daphn\u00e9 had sheer confusion on her face which now made the boys laugh too.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t say things like that.\u201d Alexia answered between two giggles.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not appropriate.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhy? I was being honest.\u201d she mumbled, pouting at her friends sadly.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Daphy. We get what you were trying to say.\u201d Lucas said softly and hopped off the table.\u00a0\u201cI should get going now. You coming?\u201d he looked at Eliott who was still leaning on the table.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d he pushed himself forward, shooting a soft smile at the four girls.\u00a0\u201cSee you later.\u201d he said and followed the short one out of the common room.\u00a0<br></p><p>When they were far enough, they started laughing. Both of them couldn\u2019t hold it back anymore, because that was just the funniest thing ever. It took them minutes to stop, wiping off tears that spilled out from the heavy laughs and then they looked at each other. Eliott leaned to the lockers behind him, while Lucas was standing in front of him with a big smile on his face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat was fun.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMore like awkward.\u201d the tall boy sighed, but couldn\u2019t stop smiling.\u00a0\u201cYou have some really nosy friends.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThey are girls, Eliott, of course they are nosy.\u201d he smirked and stepped closer to him. Eliott felt butterflies in his stomach.\u00a0\u201cAnd even if they are my friends, they have no right to ask about us.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo there is <i>us</i> now?\u201d he raised an eyebrow, trying to sound playful, but the look on the other\u2019s face made his heart beat faster.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThere is always <i>us</i>, Eliott.\u201d he almost whispered those words, taking another step forward, being dangerously close to him. He could feel his heartbeat thumping in his ears, making it impossible for him to hear anything, but it was fine, because Lucas was there in front of him. Time seemed to slow down as the short boy placed his hands on the lockers, caging Eliott and raised up on his tiptoes, leaning forward. The tall boy closed his eyes, parting his lips, being ready to be kissed, when the door next to them shot open with a loud bang, startling them out of their little bubble. Lucas smirked at him and just like nothing happened, he ran his fingers over Eliott\u2019s arm while pulling back and walked away.\u00a0\u201cSee you later.\u201d he said over his shoulder and disappeared in the crowd of students.\u00a0<br></p><p><br></p><p>It was lunch time and Eliott still couldn\u2019t forget about that almost kiss this morning with Lucas. He tried so hard to forget about it, but his damn mind kept going back, replaying the scene in an endless loop. Just like always, he shared a table with Alex and his friends, but this time he didn\u2019t even try to join their conversation. Not like he didn\u2019t wanted to, but he knew that he would not be able to focus on anything these people say. Also he needed to force himself not to look up and search for a certain pair of blue eyes in the cafeteria.\u00a0</p><p>He got startled when his phone started buzzing in his pocket. Luckily the others were in a deep conversation about something, probably Alex\u2019s party this friday, because he could hear the words\u00a0\u2018hookup\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018getting wasted\u2019. He pulled the device out of his pocket and checked his messages. The amount of self control he had almost wasn\u2019t enough to hold himself back from snapping his head up and look over to Lucas table. This boy is going to be the death of him.\u00a0<br></p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Not even a glance at me?\u00a0<br>I feel offended, sir\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>Can\u2019t you just eat in peace?\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>I\u2019m not so hungry<br>Well, not for food at least\u00a0</p><p>Eliott couldn\u2019t believe the audacity of this kid. And also couldn\u2019t believe his own awkwardness. When did he become the shy, submissive one? He let out a sigh, trying to calm himself down and looked up, his eyes immediately finding those blue pools in the crowd. The self-satisfied smirk on Lucas\u2019 face woke up the alpha inside the tall boy, washing away all the shyness and embarrassment he felt just a few seconds ago.\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>Well, I can\u2019t let my sweet hedgehog starve, right?</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Are you going to the party on friday?\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>Depends</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>On what?\u00a0</p><p>Eliott can see the longing in the boy\u2019s eyes as they lock eyes after each text. It\u2019s intense and full of passion. A few weeks ago he was just a depressed pile on his own bed, holding onto his phone like his life depended on it and now he was here with the boy that helped him through his rough phase, basically having sex through eyecontact. A playful smirk creeped up on his face which got answered by wiggling eyebrows from the other boy.\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>Depends on how much you want me to go\u00a0</p><p>When he read the message, Lucas head snapped up, a grumpy expression taking over his handsome face, making him look like an actual hedgehog. The tall boy winked at him, just for fun and he rolled his eyes in response. He looked down at his phone now, ready to type the answer, when Yann snatched the device from him with a disapproving look on his face, probably scolding his friend now for not joining their conversation. Eliott had to suppress a laugh and as he brought his gaze back to the table, he noticed that Alex is looking at him with a wide smirk on his face.</p><p>\u201cSo it is Lucas.\u201d he says victoriously, like he just won something.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d he shrugs, but he can\u2019t take off the happy smile that\u2019s plastered to his face thanks to the short boy.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a nice kid.\u201d Alex said and munched on a tomato slice.\u00a0\u201cAnd he is my friend, so don\u2019t fuck this up, okay?\u201d he added on a more serious tone and continued eating his salad.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I could never hurt him.\u201d he said honestly, letting himself a glance towards the younger boy. He was trying to get his phone back from his best friend, while the others laughed at them. It was endearing to watch, especially after Lucas told him how lonely he feels at school. Only if he knew how many people cared for him.\u00a0<br></p><p><br></p><p>Friday came fairly quickly. He didn\u2019t talk much to Lucas since wednesday, not in person at least. They just couldn\u2019t stop texting each other through the days, it was something that become part of their daily routine. Now he was sitting at the bus stop, waiting while smoking a cigarette. He promised Sofiane that he will join him in the Youth Center to hang out after school. His friend is going to leave to Morocco on saturday noon, so he used all the opportunities to hang out with him. He invited him to Alex\u2019s party too, but he said that he will be busy finishing the packing for the trip, while Idriss happily agreed to go. At least he will have some emotional support, because he was sure he\u2019s going to need it remembering that he will probably have to handle drunk Lucas in real life this time.\u00a0</p><p>When his bus arrived, he put out the remains of his cigarette, throwing it into the trash and getting on. He walked to one of the back doors, grabbing the handlebar, letting other people to take the seats. He preferred to stand anyways, staring out the window as they passed through the busy streets of Paris. His pocket was buzzing once, twice, but he didn\u2019t have time to check, needing to get off the vehicle. The Youth Center was not far from the stop and Sofiane was waiting for him outside. It was still cold, so they didn\u2019t waste much time, getting inside immediately.\u00a0</p><p>Eliott spent most of his time watching his friend dance to different types of music, showing off his amazing skills. He clapped every time a song came to an end, which Sofiane thanked with a bright smile. It was nice to spend some alone time with his friend and he definitely gonna miss him once he leaves, especially now that he is constantly on an emotional rollercoaster thanks to Lucas. Of course he still had Idriss, but he wasn\u2019t really good at giving advice, especially when it came to dating.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"525\" data-orig-width=\"399\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/be7cc85b8ea2e97261870914715db429/tumblr_inline_prl57uzgK51rl818h_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"525\" data-orig-width=\"399\"></figure><p>When Sofiane was done with the practice, he took a shower. Eliott waited for him patiently, posting the picture he took on instagram. Since he revealed his face to Lucas, he decided to share his nice moments there, not to show it to people, but to let himself go back maybe years later and remember what he was doing on this day. After he finished with the uploading, he noticed that he had a few unread messages, so he opened his DMs and wasn\u2019t even surprised to see Lucas\u2019 username on the top.\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>What should I wear tonight?\u00a0<br>Okay, you are ignoring me, that\u2019s fine\u00a0<br>Instagram user srodulv, go fuck yourself\u00a0</p><p>There was a ten minute difference between the first two messages, while the last one was sent just afew minutes ago, two hours after the others. Eliott couldn\u2019t hold back a snort. His little hedgehog was so damn impatient, but that was one thing he liked in him.\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>You sure you want me to go fuck myself and not someone else?\u00a0</p><p>He let out a soft laugh when the respond came in less than a minute later. His sweet boy was probably checking his phone instantly.</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Don\u2019t you dare flirting with me now\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>Wear something tight\u00a0<br>You look good in blue</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>I\u2019m going to wear black<br>Ready for your funeral\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>Ouch<br>That hurt</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>You deserved it\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>I am spending time with my friend, just so you know\u00a0<br>He\u2019s leaving to Morocco tomorrow for a whole month\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Oh\u2026</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>See you on the party tonight, you grumpy hedgehog\u00a0\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\n\n</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Yeah, see you\u00a0\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\n\n</p><p>\u201cAre you talking to your boy?\u201d Sofiane snapped him out of staring at his phone. He looked up to see his friend all dressed to his street clothes, bag in his hand, jacket on his shoulder, ready to leave.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d he answered and got up from the bench where he was sitting, both of them put on their jackets now, walking outside.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHow are things going with him?\u201d his friend asked curiously.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s going to give me a heart attack sooner or later.\u201d Eliott sighed and smiled at his friend, telling him about their time spent at his apartment, then the almost kiss at school the next morning. Sofiane listened carefully, sometimes nodding or flashing a little smirk, but he didn\u2019t ask questions until he was done talking.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWow, that kid has no chill.\u201d he laughed.\u00a0\u201cAnd you say he\u2019s a closeted gay guy?\u201d he asked which Eliott answered with a nod.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s either very bold or totally gone for you.\u201d he added smirking, making his friend blush slightly.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d Eliott asked, not being sure about Lucas\u2019 intentions still. He wasn\u2019t really experienced with boys and maybe he just saw the opportunity to have his first attempts with someone like Eliott. Someone that would do anything to kiss those cherry lips.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI mean\u2026 I know nothing about being gay or anything, but believe me, love makes you do stupid things.\u201d he explained and opened the door to their favorite coffee place now, letting his friend to walk in first. Eliott smiled softly as he entered the building, sitting down to their usual table.\u00a0<br></p><p>They ordered coffee and cakes while talking about random things. Eliott tried to avoid thinking about Lucas or the upcoming party. Instead he kept asking his friend about the trip to Morocco, about his parents and what he\u2019s going to do once he arrives. He was demanding pictures of course, since Eliott was an artist, he loved exotic countries and Sofiane had quite a talent in making beautiful pictures of landscapes.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"602\" data-orig-width=\"399\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f5ba6b3d5e250c44a0240282f812594b/tumblr_inline_prl7jdekv61rl818h_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"602\" data-orig-width=\"399\"></figure><p>Eliott just rolled his eyes when he saw the post Sofiane tagged him in. They were standing in the bus stop now, waiting for their ride home. The brunette still had time until the party even though they spent more than an hour at the coffee shop. It was just hard to get separated from Sofiane, since he was such a sunshne and always made him feel warm inside. But both of them had things to do and therefore separating was inevitable.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou seriously had to post that picture?\u201d he asked, glancing at his friend while he replied to Idriss\u2019 idiot comment.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you like it?\u201d he raised his eyebrows.\u00a0\u201cI can finally share pictures of you on social media, because you are not hiding from that cute boy of yours. I wanted to use the opportunity to show off my best friend.\u201d he said with a wide smile and bumped his shoulder to Eliott\u2019s.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d said the other laughing, but he was actually flattered by the kind words.\u00a0<br></p><p>Eliott\u2019s bus arrived first and he got an annoyed growling from the driver, because he was hugging his friend for too long and the bus was still waiting. Sofiane gently shoved him towards the vehicle, so he got on, waving as they left the stop. It was horrible to think about how he\u2019s not gonna be able to just call him or appear at his doorstep randomly when he\u2019s not feeling well. Yes, he had Idriss and even Alex, but they weren\u2019t the same. He knew Sofiane since a long time now, he was there when he discovered his mental illness, when he broke up with Lucille and fell deep into depression. He was helping him to get through the rough days while not forcing him to talk or do something he didn\u2019t wanted to. It was hard to admit, but he was scared without Sofiane.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>He arrived to Alex\u2019s house a bit later than Idriss, so he just walked in, hugged their host when he greeted him in the hallway and decided to head towards the kitchen. He needed to drink something to down his fears. He was being like a pathetic child who\u2019s crying after his mom in kindergarten. Sofiane won\u2019t be away for long and they will keep in touch anyways.\u00a0</p><p>When he steps into the kitchen, he is struck by the beauty of the boy called Lucas Lallemant. He is there with his friends, sharing what probably is a joint judging by its smell. He is wearing tight, black pants and a button up jean shirt, looking like an angel with his disheveled hair. Eliott blinks once, twice and he feels like the air got punched out of his lungs when the boy\u2019s deep blue eyes find his, staring at him while he holds the joint between his lips lazily. He let out a thick cloud of smoke as he passed the blunt to his friends, not taking his eyes off Eliott. Thankfully the other three was too busy glancing at the dancing crowd in the living room, talking about hot girls.\u00a0</p><p>Lucas now decided to hop up on the kitchen counter with a simple and smooth movement. He kept looking at Eliott, raising his eyebrows, challenging the tall boy to approach him and let\u2019s be honest, he had no intentions to stay away, since he looked so charming just dangling his legs like a kid as he was sitting on the counter. His smile grew bigger when Eliott walked into the kitchen, nodding to the trio that was still rambling about girls.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d he greeted them, which draw all of their attention to the tall boy. The blonde one, Arthur seemed to be a bit shocked and maybe even stunned by the presence of the older boy, while Yann flashed him a smile. Basile was just utterly confused and maybe a bit upset that someone interrupted their chick-talk.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHey, dude.\u201d Yann said, reaching out his hand, which Eliott took gladly, shaking it.\u00a0\u201cEliott, right?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess you\u2019ve heard of me.\u201d he smiled and felt proud that Lucas\u2019 best friend knew who he was, so this meant that he talked to his gang about him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWait, are you the guy from Lucas\u2019 insta?\u201d Basile asked with sudden interest and his eyes widened.\u00a0\u201cWow, you are fucking handsome.\u201d he gasped, mouth agape and he let out an unpleasant whine when Arthur hit his side with his elbow. Eliott laughed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBaz, how about you shut up?\u201d came a soft voice from behind the tall boy, it was a bit deep from all the smoking and Eliott just loved that. He turned around, flashing a charming smile at the short boy, who was still sitting on the counter, balancing his body on his hands behind him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d the tall boy said with a playful smirk, enjoying the sparkles that appeared in Lucas\u2019 ocean blue irises.<br></p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d he chimed, holding out his hands now, confusing Eliott for a second before he spoke again.\u00a0\u201cGive me that, Arthur.\u201d he asked gently and the blonde one reached out his hand, passing the joint to the brunette now, who held it between his fingers carefully.\u00a0\u201cYou know how to smoke, Eliott?\u201d he asked with a cheeky smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Eliott answered, gladly participating in this little flirtatious game the other was playing. He could hear the gasp of Lucas\u2019 friends behind him, but he couldn\u2019t care less. When the boy waved his hand to him, he walked closer, stopping just a step away from him, his knees were slightly brushing Eliott\u2019s sides.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou wanna share this with me?\u201d the short one asked playing with the joint in his hands. Eliott smiled, placing his hands on the counter, dangerously close to the boy\u2019s thighs and leant forward. Their faces were in the same height like this, which was pretty intriguing.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d he muttered, his ear slowly closed out the thumping of the music and the shocked noises that came from behind them.\u00a0<br></p><p>No words needed Lucas took a long drag from the blunt, throwing the remains into the sink. He kept the smoke in as he leant forward, Eliott mirroring his movements until their foreheads touched. He felt a soft, warm hand grabbing the back of his head, deep blue eyes staring at him in anticipation. His heart was threatening to break out of his chest, splashing onto the other boy\u2019s shirt in excitement. He gently parted his lips, which was more than enough for the short boy to make a move, blowing out the smoke for him to inhale. He closed his eyes, feeling his head going dizzy and not because of the weed. He let it to fill his mouth, hit him a little before he let it out too. He was glad that Lucas didn\u2019t pull back, keeping their foreheads touching, still looking into his eyes with clear desire. As he swallowed, finally getting the bravery to move forward and kiss the boy, two girls crashed into the kitchen, right next to the boys, startling them out of their little bubble. Eliott started to think that the universe just won\u2019t let them fucking kiss even once.\u00a0</p><p>He felt his stomach churn when the gagging noises reached his ears, which came from the girl that had her head fully in the sink, while the other was helding her hair and scolding her for drinking so much. Eliott recognized the one that wasn\u2019t puking, it was Chlo\u00e9, the girl that interrupted their first interraction at the bus stop just a week ago. Before he could react, he felt a warm body slightly brushing to his as Lucas slipped off the counter, sliding his hands over Eliott\u2019s stomach, just an inch away from his crotch as he walked to the living room, followed by his friends. The tall boy was standing there with a dumbfounded expression on his face, spinning around on his heels, searching the crowd for a crazy crown of hair and a pair of blue eyes, but he couldn\u2019t find him. Meanwhile the unpleasant noises coming from the suffering girl seemed to never stop, just like the slight screams from the supporting friend.\u00a0</p><p>After taking a few deep breaths, he left the kitchen, heading towards the exit. He felt like he have to leave before anything triggers him. The music was already too loud in his ears, his heartbeat wasn\u2019t slowing down and his head was still spinning like a merry-go-round on steroids. The fresh air hit him like a truck, but it was much better than the smell of sweat, alcohol and smoke that was filling his lungs inside. He felt his knees going weak as he thought back about the moment he shared with Lucas in the kitchen.\u00a0</p><p>He couldn\u2019t remember how he got home, all of his memories was blurry, like he was drunk, but he had never been more sober. He hated his mental state and that he needed to leave instead of hunting down that beautiful boy to finally get the kiss he was deprived of twice so far. He knew it was because he kept forgetting to take his meds, that\u2019s why things were affecting him so greatly, why his mood was swinging so often without any reason actually.\u00a0</p><p>An hour passed by and he was laying on the couch like the disaster he was, still fighting down his anxiety. <b><i>Sure, Eliott, that is what Lucas needs, a guy that freaks out after shotgunning and leaving the scene right away. Dream boyfriend.</i></b>\u00a0He sighed at his own thoughts and tried to push the negativity into the back of his head, when his phone was dinging, alerting him of a new message. He checked it and his heart melted when he saw the username.</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>I can\u2019t find you anywhere\u00a0<br>Is everything okay?\u00a0<br>Are you still at the party?\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>No, I had to come home<br>I wasn\u2019t feeling good</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Did I do something bad?\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>No, you did everything good<br></p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>You should have heard the boys, they were going crazy on me\u00a0<br></p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>That was definitely one outstanding coming out for sure\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b>\u00a0<br>Seems like I can\u2019t control myself around you\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>Not like I have anything against that\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Too bad we got interrupted</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>Maybe next time we shouldn\u2019t do things like that in public</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>You know, I\u2019m getting tired of waiting for you to ask me out on a date<br>So I\u2019ll do myself</p><p>Eliott could feel a bright smile making its appearance on his face as he read the latest messages.</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>Sounds good to me\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Sunday, 11h?\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>Perfect \u2764\ufe0f\n\n</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>You jerk\u00a0\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\n\n</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><hr><p><i>Next time comes the first date of the boys!

They get along well and it\u2019s just a safe place for him to go back to when things are getting too much in his life. But january is here and he\u2019s about to start at his new school. What he doesn\u2019t expect is to bump into the person he\u2019s been texting with. Suddenly Eliott\u2019s life going upside down as he both tries to approach and avoid Lucas at the same time.</b></p><p><b>Side note: </b><i>I tried to stick to one header pic, but I am just a sucker for making these, so\u2026 yeah</i></p>[[MORE]]<hr><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2><b>Just friends</b></h2><p><br></p><p>Eliott was obviously expecting people asking questions about him and Lucas, but it still got him off guard when Daphn\u00e9 basically dragged him into the common room. When he finally realized what is happening, he was standing in front of four girls, three of them having sparks in their eyes, while the fourth one, Imane actually kept shooting him questioning looks. The tall boy wanted the ground to swallow him. It took him almost a minute to notice that Lucas was in there also, sitting on a table, eyes fixed on him and a smug little smile appearing on his face. Eliott felt his heart skip a beat. Was it even legal for a closeted gay boy to be this fucking flirtatious?\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo, details!\u201d Daphn\u00e9 claimed, eyes wide and full of excitement, she even leant forward like she wouldn\u2019t hear Eliott\u2019s words otherwise. The boy looked at his friend for help, because he suddenly got really anxious from all the attention directed towards him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThere are no details, Daphy.\u201d Lucas talked, finally taking pity on the older boy, who now sighed in relief, slowly backing off from the girls and towards him.\u00a0\u201cWe were hanging out, end of story.\u201d he shrugged like it was no big deal.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, since when are you hanging out with strangers and post pictures of them on your insta?\u201d Imane asked, raising her eyebrows and crossing her arms.<br></p><p>\u201cI never said he\u2019s a stranger.\u201d Lucas replied, also raising his brows.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHow do you two know each other then?\u201d Alexia asked now, dying to get some more information about them. Eliott decided to let the short boy handle the situation, so he just took his place next to him, leaning his hips against the table that he was sitting on.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThrough insta.\u201d he shrugged.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a long story and none of your business anyways.\u201d he continued and scooted just a tiny bit closer to Eliott so his thighs were just next to his left hand. He wasn\u2019t playing fair for sure.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSo you two are dating?\u201d Daphn\u00e9 finally asked the question that was hanging in the air since Eliott arrived. He didn\u2019t say a word, keeping him to his own decision that he\u2019s going to let Lucas handle this, since these girls were his friends.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWe are just friends.\u201d the short boy answered way too quickly and Eliott could feel his knees nudging his side softly. He looked at him, but he faced forward, staring at the girls in front of them, but a small smile was tugging on his lips.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Eliott added now, turning his head to the girls too.\u00a0\u201cAnd we were just drinking and smoking yesterday, nothing special.\u201d he said, trying to sound as nonchalant as he just could, but it wasn\u2019t easy with the boy next to him slightly moving closer to him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOkay, cool.\u201d Daphn\u00e9 breathed out, seemingly believing to the boys.\u00a0\u201cIt would be a shame for us girls if the two hottest guy in the school would date each other.\u201d she said smirking to which Imane shot her a disapproving look, while Emma and Alexia laughed.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAre you dumb or what?\u201d the muslim girl asked, still not believing the stupidity of her friend.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Daphn\u00e9 had sheer confusion on her face which now made the boys laugh too.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t say things like that.\u201d Alexia answered between two giggles.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not appropriate.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhy? I was being honest.\u201d she mumbled, pouting at her friends sadly.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Daphy. We get what you were trying to say.\u201d Lucas said softly and hopped off the table.\u00a0\u201cI should get going now. You coming?\u201d he looked at Eliott who was still leaning on the table.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d he pushed himself forward, shooting a soft smile at the four girls.\u00a0\u201cSee you later.\u201d he said and followed the short one out of the common room.\u00a0<br></p><p>When they were far enough, they started laughing. Both of them couldn\u2019t hold it back anymore, because that was just the funniest thing ever. It took them minutes to stop, wiping off tears that spilled out from the heavy laughs and then they looked at each other. Eliott leaned to the lockers behind him, while Lucas was standing in front of him with a big smile on his face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat was fun.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMore like awkward.\u201d the tall boy sighed, but couldn\u2019t stop smiling.\u00a0\u201cYou have some really nosy friends.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThey are girls, Eliott, of course they are nosy.\u201d he smirked and stepped closer to him. Eliott felt butterflies in his stomach.\u00a0\u201cAnd even if they are my friends, they have no right to ask about us.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo there is <i>us</i> now?\u201d he raised an eyebrow, trying to sound playful, but the look on the other\u2019s face made his heart beat faster.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThere is always <i>us</i>, Eliott.\u201d he almost whispered those words, taking another step forward, being dangerously close to him. He could feel his heartbeat thumping in his ears, making it impossible for him to hear anything, but it was fine, because Lucas was there in front of him. Time seemed to slow down as the short boy placed his hands on the lockers, caging Eliott and raised up on his tiptoes, leaning forward. The tall boy closed his eyes, parting his lips, being ready to be kissed, when the door next to them shot open with a loud bang, startling them out of their little bubble. Lucas smirked at him and just like nothing happened, he ran his fingers over Eliott\u2019s arm while pulling back and walked away.\u00a0\u201cSee you later.\u201d he said over his shoulder and disappeared in the crowd of students.\u00a0<br></p><p><br></p><p>It was lunch time and Eliott still couldn\u2019t forget about that almost kiss this morning with Lucas. He tried so hard to forget about it, but his damn mind kept going back, replaying the scene in an endless loop. Just like always, he shared a table with Alex and his friends, but this time he didn\u2019t even try to join their conversation. Not like he didn\u2019t wanted to, but he knew that he would not be able to focus on anything these people say. Also he needed to force himself not to look up and search for a certain pair of blue eyes in the cafeteria.\u00a0</p><p>He got startled when his phone started buzzing in his pocket. Luckily the others were in a deep conversation about something, probably Alex\u2019s party this friday, because he could hear the words\u00a0\u2018hookup\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018getting wasted\u2019. He pulled the device out of his pocket and checked his messages. The amount of self control he had almost wasn\u2019t enough to hold himself back from snapping his head up and look over to Lucas table. This boy is going to be the death of him.\u00a0<br></p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Not even a glance at me?\u00a0<br>I feel offended, sir\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>Can\u2019t you just eat in peace?\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>I\u2019m not so hungry<br>Well, not for food at least\u00a0</p><p>Eliott couldn\u2019t believe the audacity of this kid. And also couldn\u2019t believe his own awkwardness. When did he become the shy, submissive one? He let out a sigh, trying to calm himself down and looked up, his eyes immediately finding those blue pools in the crowd. The self-satisfied smirk on Lucas\u2019 face woke up the alpha inside the tall boy, washing away all the shyness and embarrassment he felt just a few seconds ago.\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>Well, I can\u2019t let my sweet hedgehog starve, right?</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Are you going to the party on friday?\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>Depends</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>On what?\u00a0</p><p>Eliott can see the longing in the boy\u2019s eyes as they lock eyes after each text. It\u2019s intense and full of passion. A few weeks ago he was just a depressed pile on his own bed, holding onto his phone like his life depended on it and now he was here with the boy that helped him through his rough phase, basically having sex through eyecontact. A playful smirk creeped up on his face which got answered by wiggling eyebrows from the other boy.\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>Depends on how much you want me to go\u00a0</p><p>When he read the message, Lucas head snapped up, a grumpy expression taking over his handsome face, making him look like an actual hedgehog. The tall boy winked at him, just for fun and he rolled his eyes in response. He looked down at his phone now, ready to type the answer, when Yann snatched the device from him with a disapproving look on his face, probably scolding his friend now for not joining their conversation. Eliott had to suppress a laugh and as he brought his gaze back to the table, he noticed that Alex is looking at him with a wide smirk on his face.</p><p>\u201cSo it is Lucas.\u201d he says victoriously, like he just won something.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d he shrugs, but he can\u2019t take off the happy smile that\u2019s plastered to his face thanks to the short boy.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a nice kid.\u201d Alex said and munched on a tomato slice.\u00a0\u201cAnd he is my friend, so don\u2019t fuck this up, okay?\u201d he added on a more serious tone and continued eating his salad.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I could never hurt him.\u201d he said honestly, letting himself a glance towards the younger boy. He was trying to get his phone back from his best friend, while the others laughed at them. It was endearing to watch, especially after Lucas told him how lonely he feels at school. Only if he knew how many people cared for him.\u00a0<br></p><p><br></p><p>Friday came fairly quickly. He didn\u2019t talk much to Lucas since wednesday, not in person at least. They just couldn\u2019t stop texting each other through the days, it was something that become part of their daily routine. Now he was sitting at the bus stop, waiting while smoking a cigarette. He promised Sofiane that he will join him in the Youth Center to hang out after school. His friend is going to leave to Morocco on saturday noon, so he used all the opportunities to hang out with him. He invited him to Alex\u2019s party too, but he said that he will be busy finishing the packing for the trip, while Idriss happily agreed to go. At least he will have some emotional support, because he was sure he\u2019s going to need it remembering that he will probably have to handle drunk Lucas in real life this time.\u00a0</p><p>When his bus arrived, he put out the remains of his cigarette, throwing it into the trash and getting on. He walked to one of the back doors, grabbing the handlebar, letting other people to take the seats. He preferred to stand anyways, staring out the window as they passed through the busy streets of Paris. His pocket was buzzing once, twice, but he didn\u2019t have time to check, needing to get off the vehicle. The Youth Center was not far from the stop and Sofiane was waiting for him outside. It was still cold, so they didn\u2019t waste much time, getting inside immediately.\u00a0</p><p>Eliott spent most of his time watching his friend dance to different types of music, showing off his amazing skills. He clapped every time a song came to an end, which Sofiane thanked with a bright smile. It was nice to spend some alone time with his friend and he definitely gonna miss him once he leaves, especially now that he is constantly on an emotional rollercoaster thanks to Lucas. Of course he still had Idriss, but he wasn\u2019t really good at giving advice, especially when it came to dating.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"525\" data-orig-width=\"399\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/be7cc85b8ea2e97261870914715db429/tumblr_inline_prl57uzgK51rl818h_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"525\" data-orig-width=\"399\"></figure><p>When Sofiane was done with the practice, he took a shower. Eliott waited for him patiently, posting the picture he took on instagram. Since he revealed his face to Lucas, he decided to share his nice moments there, not to show it to people, but to let himself go back maybe years later and remember what he was doing on this day. After he finished with the uploading, he noticed that he had a few unread messages, so he opened his DMs and wasn\u2019t even surprised to see Lucas\u2019 username on the top.\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>What should I wear tonight?\u00a0<br>Okay, you are ignoring me, that\u2019s fine\u00a0<br>Instagram user srodulv, go fuck yourself\u00a0</p><p>There was a ten minute difference between the first two messages, while the last one was sent just afew minutes ago, two hours after the others. Eliott couldn\u2019t hold back a snort. His little hedgehog was so damn impatient, but that was one thing he liked in him.\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>You sure you want me to go fuck myself and not someone else?\u00a0</p><p>He let out a soft laugh when the respond came in less than a minute later. His sweet boy was probably checking his phone instantly.</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Don\u2019t you dare flirting with me now\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>Wear something tight\u00a0<br>You look good in blue</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>I\u2019m going to wear black<br>Ready for your funeral\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>Ouch<br>That hurt</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>You deserved it\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>I am spending time with my friend, just so you know\u00a0<br>He\u2019s leaving to Morocco tomorrow for a whole month\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Oh\u2026</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>See you on the party tonight, you grumpy hedgehog\u00a0\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\n\n</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Yeah, see you\u00a0\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\n\n</p><p>\u201cAre you talking to your boy?\u201d Sofiane snapped him out of staring at his phone. He looked up to see his friend all dressed to his street clothes, bag in his hand, jacket on his shoulder, ready to leave.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d he answered and got up from the bench where he was sitting, both of them put on their jackets now, walking outside.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHow are things going with him?\u201d his friend asked curiously.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s going to give me a heart attack sooner or later.\u201d Eliott sighed and smiled at his friend, telling him about their time spent at his apartment, then the almost kiss at school the next morning. Sofiane listened carefully, sometimes nodding or flashing a little smirk, but he didn\u2019t ask questions until he was done talking.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWow, that kid has no chill.\u201d he laughed.\u00a0\u201cAnd you say he\u2019s a closeted gay guy?\u201d he asked which Eliott answered with a nod.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s either very bold or totally gone for you.\u201d he added smirking, making his friend blush slightly.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d Eliott asked, not being sure about Lucas\u2019 intentions still. He wasn\u2019t really experienced with boys and maybe he just saw the opportunity to have his first attempts with someone like Eliott. Someone that would do anything to kiss those cherry lips.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI mean\u2026 I know nothing about being gay or anything, but believe me, love makes you do stupid things.\u201d he explained and opened the door to their favorite coffee place now, letting his friend to walk in first. Eliott smiled softly as he entered the building, sitting down to their usual table.\u00a0<br></p><p>They ordered coffee and cakes while talking about random things. Eliott tried to avoid thinking about Lucas or the upcoming party. Instead he kept asking his friend about the trip to Morocco, about his parents and what he\u2019s going to do once he arrives. He was demanding pictures of course, since Eliott was an artist, he loved exotic countries and Sofiane had quite a talent in making beautiful pictures of landscapes.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"602\" data-orig-width=\"399\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f5ba6b3d5e250c44a0240282f812594b/tumblr_inline_prl7jdekv61rl818h_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"602\" data-orig-width=\"399\"></figure><p>Eliott just rolled his eyes when he saw the post Sofiane tagged him in. They were standing in the bus stop now, waiting for their ride home. The brunette still had time until the party even though they spent more than an hour at the coffee shop. It was just hard to get separated from Sofiane, since he was such a sunshne and always made him feel warm inside. But both of them had things to do and therefore separating was inevitable.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou seriously had to post that picture?\u201d he asked, glancing at his friend while he replied to Idriss\u2019 idiot comment.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you like it?\u201d he raised his eyebrows.\u00a0\u201cI can finally share pictures of you on social media, because you are not hiding from that cute boy of yours. I wanted to use the opportunity to show off my best friend.\u201d he said with a wide smile and bumped his shoulder to Eliott\u2019s.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d said the other laughing, but he was actually flattered by the kind words.\u00a0<br></p><p>Eliott\u2019s bus arrived first and he got an annoyed growling from the driver, because he was hugging his friend for too long and the bus was still waiting. Sofiane gently shoved him towards the vehicle, so he got on, waving as they left the stop. It was horrible to think about how he\u2019s not gonna be able to just call him or appear at his doorstep randomly when he\u2019s not feeling well. Yes, he had Idriss and even Alex, but they weren\u2019t the same. He knew Sofiane since a long time now, he was there when he discovered his mental illness, when he broke up with Lucille and fell deep into depression. He was helping him to get through the rough days while not forcing him to talk or do something he didn\u2019t wanted to. It was hard to admit, but he was scared without Sofiane.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>He arrived to Alex\u2019s house a bit later than Idriss, so he just walked in, hugged their host when he greeted him in the hallway and decided to head towards the kitchen. He needed to drink something to down his fears. He was being like a pathetic child who\u2019s crying after his mom in kindergarten. Sofiane won\u2019t be away for long and they will keep in touch anyways.\u00a0</p><p>When he steps into the kitchen, he is struck by the beauty of the boy called Lucas Lallemant. He is there with his friends, sharing what probably is a joint judging by its smell. He is wearing tight, black pants and a button up jean shirt, looking like an angel with his disheveled hair. Eliott blinks once, twice and he feels like the air got punched out of his lungs when the boy\u2019s deep blue eyes find his, staring at him while he holds the joint between his lips lazily. He let out a thick cloud of smoke as he passed the blunt to his friends, not taking his eyes off Eliott. Thankfully the other three was too busy glancing at the dancing crowd in the living room, talking about hot girls.\u00a0</p><p>Lucas now decided to hop up on the kitchen counter with a simple and smooth movement. He kept looking at Eliott, raising his eyebrows, challenging the tall boy to approach him and let\u2019s be honest, he had no intentions to stay away, since he looked so charming just dangling his legs like a kid as he was sitting on the counter. His smile grew bigger when Eliott walked into the kitchen, nodding to the trio that was still rambling about girls.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d he greeted them, which draw all of their attention to the tall boy. The blonde one, Arthur seemed to be a bit shocked and maybe even stunned by the presence of the older boy, while Yann flashed him a smile. Basile was just utterly confused and maybe a bit upset that someone interrupted their chick-talk.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHey, dude.\u201d Yann said, reaching out his hand, which Eliott took gladly, shaking it.\u00a0\u201cEliott, right?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess you\u2019ve heard of me.\u201d he smiled and felt proud that Lucas\u2019 best friend knew who he was, so this meant that he talked to his gang about him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWait, are you the guy from Lucas\u2019 insta?\u201d Basile asked with sudden interest and his eyes widened.\u00a0\u201cWow, you are fucking handsome.\u201d he gasped, mouth agape and he let out an unpleasant whine when Arthur hit his side with his elbow. Eliott laughed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBaz, how about you shut up?\u201d came a soft voice from behind the tall boy, it was a bit deep from all the smoking and Eliott just loved that. He turned around, flashing a charming smile at the short boy, who was still sitting on the counter, balancing his body on his hands behind him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d the tall boy said with a playful smirk, enjoying the sparkles that appeared in Lucas\u2019 ocean blue irises.<br></p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d he chimed, holding out his hands now, confusing Eliott for a second before he spoke again.\u00a0\u201cGive me that, Arthur.\u201d he asked gently and the blonde one reached out his hand, passing the joint to the brunette now, who held it between his fingers carefully.\u00a0\u201cYou know how to smoke, Eliott?\u201d he asked with a cheeky smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Eliott answered, gladly participating in this little flirtatious game the other was playing. He could hear the gasp of Lucas\u2019 friends behind him, but he couldn\u2019t care less. When the boy waved his hand to him, he walked closer, stopping just a step away from him, his knees were slightly brushing Eliott\u2019s sides.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou wanna share this with me?\u201d the short one asked playing with the joint in his hands. Eliott smiled, placing his hands on the counter, dangerously close to the boy\u2019s thighs and leant forward. Their faces were in the same height like this, which was pretty intriguing.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d he muttered, his ear slowly closed out the thumping of the music and the shocked noises that came from behind them.\u00a0<br></p><p>No words needed Lucas took a long drag from the blunt, throwing the remains into the sink. He kept the smoke in as he leant forward, Eliott mirroring his movements until their foreheads touched. He felt a soft, warm hand grabbing the back of his head, deep blue eyes staring at him in anticipation. His heart was threatening to break out of his chest, splashing onto the other boy\u2019s shirt in excitement. He gently parted his lips, which was more than enough for the short boy to make a move, blowing out the smoke for him to inhale. He closed his eyes, feeling his head going dizzy and not because of the weed. He let it to fill his mouth, hit him a little before he let it out too. He was glad that Lucas didn\u2019t pull back, keeping their foreheads touching, still looking into his eyes with clear desire. As he swallowed, finally getting the bravery to move forward and kiss the boy, two girls crashed into the kitchen, right next to the boys, startling them out of their little bubble. Eliott started to think that the universe just won\u2019t let them fucking kiss even once.\u00a0</p><p>He felt his stomach churn when the gagging noises reached his ears, which came from the girl that had her head fully in the sink, while the other was helding her hair and scolding her for drinking so much. Eliott recognized the one that wasn\u2019t puking, it was Chlo\u00e9, the girl that interrupted their first interraction at the bus stop just a week ago. Before he could react, he felt a warm body slightly brushing to his as Lucas slipped off the counter, sliding his hands over Eliott\u2019s stomach, just an inch away from his crotch as he walked to the living room, followed by his friends. The tall boy was standing there with a dumbfounded expression on his face, spinning around on his heels, searching the crowd for a crazy crown of hair and a pair of blue eyes, but he couldn\u2019t find him. Meanwhile the unpleasant noises coming from the suffering girl seemed to never stop, just like the slight screams from the supporting friend.\u00a0</p><p>After taking a few deep breaths, he left the kitchen, heading towards the exit. He felt like he have to leave before anything triggers him. The music was already too loud in his ears, his heartbeat wasn\u2019t slowing down and his head was still spinning like a merry-go-round on steroids. The fresh air hit him like a truck, but it was much better than the smell of sweat, alcohol and smoke that was filling his lungs inside. He felt his knees going weak as he thought back about the moment he shared with Lucas in the kitchen.\u00a0</p><p>He couldn\u2019t remember how he got home, all of his memories was blurry, like he was drunk, but he had never been more sober. He hated his mental state and that he needed to leave instead of hunting down that beautiful boy to finally get the kiss he was deprived of twice so far. He knew it was because he kept forgetting to take his meds, that\u2019s why things were affecting him so greatly, why his mood was swinging so often without any reason actually.\u00a0</p><p>An hour passed by and he was laying on the couch like the disaster he was, still fighting down his anxiety. <b><i>Sure, Eliott, that is what Lucas needs, a guy that freaks out after shotgunning and leaving the scene right away. Dream boyfriend.</i></b>\u00a0He sighed at his own thoughts and tried to push the negativity into the back of his head, when his phone was dinging, alerting him of a new message. He checked it and his heart melted when he saw the username.</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>I can\u2019t find you anywhere\u00a0<br>Is everything okay?\u00a0<br>Are you still at the party?\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>No, I had to come home<br>I wasn\u2019t feeling good</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Did I do something bad?\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>No, you did everything good<br></p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>You should have heard the boys, they were going crazy on me\u00a0<br></p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>That was definitely one outstanding coming out for sure\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b>\u00a0<br>Seems like I can\u2019t control myself around you\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>Not like I have anything against that\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Too bad we got interrupted</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>Maybe next time we shouldn\u2019t do things like that in public</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>You know, I\u2019m getting tired of waiting for you to ask me out on a date<br>So I\u2019ll do myself</p><p>Eliott could feel a bright smile making its appearance on his face as he read the latest messages.</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>Sounds good to me\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Sunday, 11h?\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>Perfect \u2764\ufe0f\n\n</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>You jerk\u00a0\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\n\n</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><hr><p><i>Next time comes the first date of the boys!

They get along well and it&rsquo;s just a safe place for him to go back to when things are getting too much in his life. But january is here and he&rsquo;s about to start at his new school. What he doesn&rsquo;t expect is to bump into the person he&rsquo;s been texting with. Suddenly Eliott&rsquo;s life going upside down as he both tries to approach and avoid Lucas at the same time.</b></p><p><b>Side note: </b><i>I tried to stick to one header pic, but I am just a sucker for making these, so&hellip; yeah</i></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h2><b>Just friends</b></h2><p><br /></p><p>Eliott was obviously expecting people asking questions about him and Lucas, but it still got him off guard when Daphn&eacute; basically dragged him into the common room. When he finally realized what is happening, he was standing in front of four girls, three of them having sparks in their eyes, while the fourth one, Imane actually kept shooting him questioning looks. The tall boy wanted the ground to swallow him. It took him almost a minute to notice that Lucas was in there also, sitting on a table, eyes fixed on him and a smug little smile appearing on his face. Eliott felt his heart skip a beat. Was it even legal for a closeted gay boy to be this fucking flirtatious?&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So, details!&rdquo; Daphn&eacute; claimed, eyes wide and full of excitement, she even leant forward like she wouldn&rsquo;t hear Eliott&rsquo;s words otherwise. The boy looked at his friend for help, because he suddenly got really anxious from all the attention directed towards him.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;There are no details, Daphy.&rdquo; Lucas talked, finally taking pity on the older boy, who now sighed in relief, slowly backing off from the girls and towards him.&nbsp;&ldquo;We were hanging out, end of story.&rdquo; he shrugged like it was no big deal.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, since when are you hanging out with strangers and post pictures of them on your insta?&rdquo; Imane asked, raising her eyebrows and crossing her arms.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I never said he&rsquo;s a stranger.&rdquo; Lucas replied, also raising his brows.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;How do you two know each other then?&rdquo; Alexia asked now, dying to get some more information about them. Eliott decided to let the short boy handle the situation, so he just took his place next to him, leaning his hips against the table that he was sitting on.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Through insta.&rdquo; he shrugged.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story and none of your business anyways.&rdquo; he continued and scooted just a tiny bit closer to Eliott so his thighs were just next to his left hand. He wasn&rsquo;t playing fair for sure.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So you two are dating?&rdquo; Daphn&eacute; finally asked the question that was hanging in the air since Eliott arrived. He didn&rsquo;t say a word, keeping him to his own decision that he&rsquo;s going to let Lucas handle this, since these girls were his friends.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We are just friends.&rdquo; the short boy answered way too quickly and Eliott could feel his knees nudging his side softly. He looked at him, but he faced forward, staring at the girls in front of them, but a small smile was tugging on his lips.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true.&rdquo; Eliott added now, turning his head to the girls too.&nbsp;&ldquo;And we were just drinking and smoking yesterday, nothing special.&rdquo; he said, trying to sound as nonchalant as he just could, but it wasn&rsquo;t easy with the boy next to him slightly moving closer to him.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay, cool.&rdquo; Daphn&eacute; breathed out, seemingly believing to the boys.&nbsp;&ldquo;It would be a shame for us girls if the two hottest guy in the school would date each other.&rdquo; she said smirking to which Imane shot her a disapproving look, while Emma and Alexia laughed.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Are you dumb or what?&rdquo; the muslim girl asked, still not believing the stupidity of her friend.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Daphn&eacute; had sheer confusion on her face which now made the boys laugh too.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t say things like that.&rdquo; Alexia answered between two giggles.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not appropriate.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why? I was being honest.&rdquo; she mumbled, pouting at her friends sadly.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Daphy. We get what you were trying to say.&rdquo; Lucas said softly and hopped off the table.&nbsp;&ldquo;I should get going now. You coming?&rdquo; he looked at Eliott who was still leaning on the table.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, sure.&rdquo; he pushed himself forward, shooting a soft smile at the four girls.&nbsp;&ldquo;See you later.&rdquo; he said and followed the short one out of the common room.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>When they were far enough, they started laughing. Both of them couldn&rsquo;t hold it back anymore, because that was just the funniest thing ever. It took them minutes to stop, wiping off tears that spilled out from the heavy laughs and then they looked at each other. Eliott leaned to the lockers behind him, while Lucas was standing in front of him with a big smile on his face.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That was fun.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;More like awkward.&rdquo; the tall boy sighed, but couldn&rsquo;t stop smiling.&nbsp;&ldquo;You have some really nosy friends.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;They are girls, Eliott, of course they are nosy.&rdquo; he smirked and stepped closer to him. Eliott felt butterflies in his stomach.&nbsp;&ldquo;And even if they are my friends, they have no right to ask about us.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So there is <i>us</i> now?&rdquo; he raised an eyebrow, trying to sound playful, but the look on the other&rsquo;s face made his heart beat faster.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;There is always <i>us</i>, Eliott.&rdquo; he almost whispered those words, taking another step forward, being dangerously close to him. He could feel his heartbeat thumping in his ears, making it impossible for him to hear anything, but it was fine, because Lucas was there in front of him. Time seemed to slow down as the short boy placed his hands on the lockers, caging Eliott and raised up on his tiptoes, leaning forward. The tall boy closed his eyes, parting his lips, being ready to be kissed, when the door next to them shot open with a loud bang, startling them out of their little bubble. Lucas smirked at him and just like nothing happened, he ran his fingers over Eliott&rsquo;s arm while pulling back and walked away.&nbsp;&ldquo;See you later.&rdquo; he said over his shoulder and disappeared in the crowd of students.&nbsp;<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>It was lunch time and Eliott still couldn&rsquo;t forget about that almost kiss this morning with Lucas. He tried so hard to forget about it, but his damn mind kept going back, replaying the scene in an endless loop. Just like always, he shared a table with Alex and his friends, but this time he didn&rsquo;t even try to join their conversation. Not like he didn&rsquo;t wanted to, but he knew that he would not be able to focus on anything these people say. Also he needed to force himself not to look up and search for a certain pair of blue eyes in the cafeteria.&nbsp;</p><p>He got startled when his phone started buzzing in his pocket. Luckily the others were in a deep conversation about something, probably Alex&rsquo;s party this friday, because he could hear the words&nbsp;&lsquo;hookup&rsquo; and&nbsp;&lsquo;getting wasted&rsquo;. He pulled the device out of his pocket and checked his messages. The amount of self control he had almost wasn&rsquo;t enough to hold himself back from snapping his head up and look over to Lucas table. This boy is going to be the death of him.&nbsp;<br /></p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />Not even a glance at me?&nbsp;<br />I feel offended, sir&nbsp;</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br />Can&rsquo;t you just eat in peace?&nbsp;</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />I&rsquo;m not so hungry<br />Well, not for food at least&nbsp;</p><p>Eliott couldn&rsquo;t believe the audacity of this kid. And also couldn&rsquo;t believe his own awkwardness. When did he become the shy, submissive one? He let out a sigh, trying to calm himself down and looked up, his eyes immediately finding those blue pools in the crowd. The self-satisfied smirk on Lucas&rsquo; face woke up the alpha inside the tall boy, washing away all the shyness and embarrassment he felt just a few seconds ago.&nbsp;</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br />Well, I can&rsquo;t let my sweet hedgehog starve, right?</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />Are you going to the party on friday?&nbsp;</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br />Depends</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />On what?&nbsp;</p><p>Eliott can see the longing in the boy&rsquo;s eyes as they lock eyes after each text. It&rsquo;s intense and full of passion. A few weeks ago he was just a depressed pile on his own bed, holding onto his phone like his life depended on it and now he was here with the boy that helped him through his rough phase, basically having sex through eyecontact. A playful smirk creeped up on his face which got answered by wiggling eyebrows from the other boy.&nbsp;</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br />Depends on how much you want me to go&nbsp;</p><p>When he read the message, Lucas head snapped up, a grumpy expression taking over his handsome face, making him look like an actual hedgehog. The tall boy winked at him, just for fun and he rolled his eyes in response. He looked down at his phone now, ready to type the answer, when Yann snatched the device from him with a disapproving look on his face, probably scolding his friend now for not joining their conversation. Eliott had to suppress a laugh and as he brought his gaze back to the table, he noticed that Alex is looking at him with a wide smirk on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;So it is Lucas.&rdquo; he says victoriously, like he just won something.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo; he shrugs, but he can&rsquo;t take off the happy smile that&rsquo;s plastered to his face thanks to the short boy.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a nice kid.&rdquo; Alex said and munched on a tomato slice.&nbsp;&ldquo;And he is my friend, so don&rsquo;t fuck this up, okay?&rdquo; he added on a more serious tone and continued eating his salad.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I could never hurt him.&rdquo; he said honestly, letting himself a glance towards the younger boy. He was trying to get his phone back from his best friend, while the others laughed at them. It was endearing to watch, especially after Lucas told him how lonely he feels at school. Only if he knew how many people cared for him.&nbsp;<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Friday came fairly quickly. He didn&rsquo;t talk much to Lucas since wednesday, not in person at least. They just couldn&rsquo;t stop texting each other through the days, it was something that become part of their daily routine. Now he was sitting at the bus stop, waiting while smoking a cigarette. He promised Sofiane that he will join him in the Youth Center to hang out after school. His friend is going to leave to Morocco on saturday noon, so he used all the opportunities to hang out with him. He invited him to Alex&rsquo;s party too, but he said that he will be busy finishing the packing for the trip, while Idriss happily agreed to go. At least he will have some emotional support, because he was sure he&rsquo;s going to need it remembering that he will probably have to handle drunk Lucas in real life this time.&nbsp;</p><p>When his bus arrived, he put out the remains of his cigarette, throwing it into the trash and getting on. He walked to one of the back doors, grabbing the handlebar, letting other people to take the seats. He preferred to stand anyways, staring out the window as they passed through the busy streets of Paris. His pocket was buzzing once, twice, but he didn&rsquo;t have time to check, needing to get off the vehicle. The Youth Center was not far from the stop and Sofiane was waiting for him outside. It was still cold, so they didn&rsquo;t waste much time, getting inside immediately.&nbsp;</p><p>Eliott spent most of his time watching his friend dance to different types of music, showing off his amazing skills. He clapped every time a song came to an end, which Sofiane thanked with a bright smile. It was nice to spend some alone time with his friend and he definitely gonna miss him once he leaves, especially now that he is constantly on an emotional rollercoaster thanks to Lucas. Of course he still had Idriss, but he wasn&rsquo;t really good at giving advice, especially when it came to dating.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/be7cc85b8ea2e97261870914715db429/tumblr_inline_prl57uzgK51rl818h_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>When Sofiane was done with the practice, he took a shower. Eliott waited for him patiently, posting the picture he took on instagram. Since he revealed his face to Lucas, he decided to share his nice moments there, not to show it to people, but to let himself go back maybe years later and remember what he was doing on this day. After he finished with the uploading, he noticed that he had a few unread messages, so he opened his DMs and wasn&rsquo;t even surprised to see Lucas&rsquo; username on the top.&nbsp;</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />What should I wear tonight?&nbsp;<br />Okay, you are ignoring me, that&rsquo;s fine&nbsp;<br />Instagram user srodulv, go fuck yourself&nbsp;</p><p>There was a ten minute difference between the first two messages, while the last one was sent just afew minutes ago, two hours after the others. Eliott couldn&rsquo;t hold back a snort. His little hedgehog was so damn impatient, but that was one thing he liked in him.&nbsp;</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br />You sure you want me to go fuck myself and not someone else?&nbsp;</p><p>He let out a soft laugh when the respond came in less than a minute later. His sweet boy was probably checking his phone instantly.</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />Don&rsquo;t you dare flirting with me now&nbsp;</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br />Wear something tight&nbsp;<br />You look good in blue</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />I&rsquo;m going to wear black<br />Ready for your funeral&nbsp;</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br />Ouch<br />That hurt</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />You deserved it&nbsp;</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br />I am spending time with my friend, just so you know&nbsp;<br />He&rsquo;s leaving to Morocco tomorrow for a whole month&nbsp;</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />Oh&hellip;</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br />See you on the party tonight, you grumpy hedgehog&nbsp;\n\n&#10084;&#65039;\n\n</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />Yeah, see you&nbsp;\n\n&#10084;&#65039;\n\n</p><p>&ldquo;Are you talking to your boy?&rdquo; Sofiane snapped him out of staring at his phone. He looked up to see his friend all dressed to his street clothes, bag in his hand, jacket on his shoulder, ready to leave.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; he answered and got up from the bench where he was sitting, both of them put on their jackets now, walking outside.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;How are things going with him?&rdquo; his friend asked curiously.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s going to give me a heart attack sooner or later.&rdquo; Eliott sighed and smiled at his friend, telling him about their time spent at his apartment, then the almost kiss at school the next morning. Sofiane listened carefully, sometimes nodding or flashing a little smirk, but he didn&rsquo;t ask questions until he was done talking.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wow, that kid has no chill.&rdquo; he laughed.&nbsp;&ldquo;And you say he&rsquo;s a closeted gay guy?&rdquo; he asked which Eliott answered with a nod.&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s either very bold or totally gone for you.&rdquo; he added smirking, making his friend blush slightly.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You think so?&rdquo; Eliott asked, not being sure about Lucas&rsquo; intentions still. He wasn&rsquo;t really experienced with boys and maybe he just saw the opportunity to have his first attempts with someone like Eliott. Someone that would do anything to kiss those cherry lips.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I mean&hellip; I know nothing about being gay or anything, but believe me, love makes you do stupid things.&rdquo; he explained and opened the door to their favorite coffee place now, letting his friend to walk in first. Eliott smiled softly as he entered the building, sitting down to their usual table.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>They ordered coffee and cakes while talking about random things. Eliott tried to avoid thinking about Lucas or the upcoming party. Instead he kept asking his friend about the trip to Morocco, about his parents and what he&rsquo;s going to do once he arrives. He was demanding pictures of course, since Eliott was an artist, he loved exotic countries and Sofiane had quite a talent in making beautiful pictures of landscapes.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f5ba6b3d5e250c44a0240282f812594b/tumblr_inline_prl7jdekv61rl818h_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Eliott just rolled his eyes when he saw the post Sofiane tagged him in. They were standing in the bus stop now, waiting for their ride home. The brunette still had time until the party even though they spent more than an hour at the coffee shop. It was just hard to get separated from Sofiane, since he was such a sunshne and always made him feel warm inside. But both of them had things to do and therefore separating was inevitable.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You seriously had to post that picture?&rdquo; he asked, glancing at his friend while he replied to Idriss&rsquo; idiot comment.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like it?&rdquo; he raised his eyebrows.&nbsp;&ldquo;I can finally share pictures of you on social media, because you are not hiding from that cute boy of yours. I wanted to use the opportunity to show off my best friend.&rdquo; he said with a wide smile and bumped his shoulder to Eliott&rsquo;s.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Shut up.&rdquo; said the other laughing, but he was actually flattered by the kind words.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Eliott&rsquo;s bus arrived first and he got an annoyed growling from the driver, because he was hugging his friend for too long and the bus was still waiting. Sofiane gently shoved him towards the vehicle, so he got on, waving as they left the stop. It was horrible to think about how he&rsquo;s not gonna be able to just call him or appear at his doorstep randomly when he&rsquo;s not feeling well. Yes, he had Idriss and even Alex, but they weren&rsquo;t the same. He knew Sofiane since a long time now, he was there when he discovered his mental illness, when he broke up with Lucille and fell deep into depression. He was helping him to get through the rough days while not forcing him to talk or do something he didn&rsquo;t wanted to. It was hard to admit, but he was scared without Sofiane.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>He arrived to Alex&rsquo;s house a bit later than Idriss, so he just walked in, hugged their host when he greeted him in the hallway and decided to head towards the kitchen. He needed to drink something to down his fears. He was being like a pathetic child who&rsquo;s crying after his mom in kindergarten. Sofiane won&rsquo;t be away for long and they will keep in touch anyways.&nbsp;</p><p>When he steps into the kitchen, he is struck by the beauty of the boy called Lucas Lallemant. He is there with his friends, sharing what probably is a joint judging by its smell. He is wearing tight, black pants and a button up jean shirt, looking like an angel with his disheveled hair. Eliott blinks once, twice and he feels like the air got punched out of his lungs when the boy&rsquo;s deep blue eyes find his, staring at him while he holds the joint between his lips lazily. He let out a thick cloud of smoke as he passed the blunt to his friends, not taking his eyes off Eliott. Thankfully the other three was too busy glancing at the dancing crowd in the living room, talking about hot girls.&nbsp;</p><p>Lucas now decided to hop up on the kitchen counter with a simple and smooth movement. He kept looking at Eliott, raising his eyebrows, challenging the tall boy to approach him and let&rsquo;s be honest, he had no intentions to stay away, since he looked so charming just dangling his legs like a kid as he was sitting on the counter. His smile grew bigger when Eliott walked into the kitchen, nodding to the trio that was still rambling about girls.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; he greeted them, which draw all of their attention to the tall boy. The blonde one, Arthur seemed to be a bit shocked and maybe even stunned by the presence of the older boy, while Yann flashed him a smile. Basile was just utterly confused and maybe a bit upset that someone interrupted their chick-talk.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey, dude.&rdquo; Yann said, reaching out his hand, which Eliott took gladly, shaking it.&nbsp;&ldquo;Eliott, right?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I guess you&rsquo;ve heard of me.&rdquo; he smiled and felt proud that Lucas&rsquo; best friend knew who he was, so this meant that he talked to his gang about him.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wait, are you the guy from Lucas&rsquo; insta?&rdquo; Basile asked with sudden interest and his eyes widened.&nbsp;&ldquo;Wow, you are fucking handsome.&rdquo; he gasped, mouth agape and he let out an unpleasant whine when Arthur hit his side with his elbow. Eliott laughed.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Baz, how about you shut up?&rdquo; came a soft voice from behind the tall boy, it was a bit deep from all the smoking and Eliott just loved that. He turned around, flashing a charming smile at the short boy, who was still sitting on the counter, balancing his body on his hands behind him.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t see you there.&rdquo; the tall boy said with a playful smirk, enjoying the sparkles that appeared in Lucas&rsquo; ocean blue irises.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah?&rdquo; he chimed, holding out his hands now, confusing Eliott for a second before he spoke again.&nbsp;&ldquo;Give me that, Arthur.&rdquo; he asked gently and the blonde one reached out his hand, passing the joint to the brunette now, who held it between his fingers carefully.&nbsp;&ldquo;You know how to smoke, Eliott?&rdquo; he asked with a cheeky smile.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo; Eliott answered, gladly participating in this little flirtatious game the other was playing. He could hear the gasp of Lucas&rsquo; friends behind him, but he couldn&rsquo;t care less. When the boy waved his hand to him, he walked closer, stopping just a step away from him, his knees were slightly brushing Eliott&rsquo;s sides.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You wanna share this with me?&rdquo; the short one asked playing with the joint in his hands. Eliott smiled, placing his hands on the counter, dangerously close to the boy&rsquo;s thighs and leant forward. Their faces were in the same height like this, which was pretty intriguing.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; he muttered, his ear slowly closed out the thumping of the music and the shocked noises that came from behind them.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>No words needed Lucas took a long drag from the blunt, throwing the remains into the sink. He kept the smoke in as he leant forward, Eliott mirroring his movements until their foreheads touched. He felt a soft, warm hand grabbing the back of his head, deep blue eyes staring at him in anticipation. His heart was threatening to break out of his chest, splashing onto the other boy&rsquo;s shirt in excitement. He gently parted his lips, which was more than enough for the short boy to make a move, blowing out the smoke for him to inhale. He closed his eyes, feeling his head going dizzy and not because of the weed. He let it to fill his mouth, hit him a little before he let it out too. He was glad that Lucas didn&rsquo;t pull back, keeping their foreheads touching, still looking into his eyes with clear desire. As he swallowed, finally getting the bravery to move forward and kiss the boy, two girls crashed into the kitchen, right next to the boys, startling them out of their little bubble. Eliott started to think that the universe just won&rsquo;t let them fucking kiss even once.&nbsp;</p><p>He felt his stomach churn when the gagging noises reached his ears, which came from the girl that had her head fully in the sink, while the other was helding her hair and scolding her for drinking so much. Eliott recognized the one that wasn&rsquo;t puking, it was Chlo&eacute;, the girl that interrupted their first interraction at the bus stop just a week ago. Before he could react, he felt a warm body slightly brushing to his as Lucas slipped off the counter, sliding his hands over Eliott&rsquo;s stomach, just an inch away from his crotch as he walked to the living room, followed by his friends. The tall boy was standing there with a dumbfounded expression on his face, spinning around on his heels, searching the crowd for a crazy crown of hair and a pair of blue eyes, but he couldn&rsquo;t find him. Meanwhile the unpleasant noises coming from the suffering girl seemed to never stop, just like the slight screams from the supporting friend.&nbsp;</p><p>After taking a few deep breaths, he left the kitchen, heading towards the exit. He felt like he have to leave before anything triggers him. The music was already too loud in his ears, his heartbeat wasn&rsquo;t slowing down and his head was still spinning like a merry-go-round on steroids. The fresh air hit him like a truck, but it was much better than the smell of sweat, alcohol and smoke that was filling his lungs inside. He felt his knees going weak as he thought back about the moment he shared with Lucas in the kitchen.&nbsp;</p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t remember how he got home, all of his memories was blurry, like he was drunk, but he had never been more sober. He hated his mental state and that he needed to leave instead of hunting down that beautiful boy to finally get the kiss he was deprived of twice so far. He knew it was because he kept forgetting to take his meds, that&rsquo;s why things were affecting him so greatly, why his mood was swinging so often without any reason actually.&nbsp;</p><p>An hour passed by and he was laying on the couch like the disaster he was, still fighting down his anxiety. <b><i>Sure, Eliott, that is what Lucas needs, a guy that freaks out after shotgunning and leaving the scene right away. Dream boyfriend.</i></b>&nbsp;He sighed at his own thoughts and tried to push the negativity into the back of his head, when his phone was dinging, alerting him of a new message. He checked it and his heart melted when he saw the username.</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />I can&rsquo;t find you anywhere&nbsp;<br />Is everything okay?&nbsp;<br />Are you still at the party?&nbsp;</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br />No, I had to come home<br />I wasn&rsquo;t feeling good</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />Did I do something bad?&nbsp;</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br />No, you did everything good<br /></p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />You should have heard the boys, they were going crazy on me&nbsp;<br /></p><p><b>srodulv</b><br />That was definitely one outstanding coming out for sure&nbsp;</p><p><b>lucallemant</b>&nbsp;<br />Seems like I can&rsquo;t control myself around you&nbsp;</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br />Not like I have anything against that&nbsp;</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />Too bad we got interrupted</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br />Maybe next time we shouldn&rsquo;t do things like that in public</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />You know, I&rsquo;m getting tired of waiting for you to ask me out on a date<br />So I&rsquo;ll do myself</p><p>Eliott could feel a bright smile making its appearance on his face as he read the latest messages.</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br />Sounds good to me&nbsp;</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />Sunday, 11h?&nbsp;</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br />Perfect &#10084;&#65039;\n\n</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />You jerk&nbsp;\n\n&#10084;&#65039;\n\n</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><i>Next time comes the first date of the boys!

In brief, bpd is a personality disorder. It affects your moods, your perception of self and others, your emotions and your impulses. It&rsquo;s characterised by fear of abandonment and being alone, sudden misplaced anger, impulsiveness and severe mood swings. It can be hard for people to maintain healthy stable relationships because of it even though they want one and are so afraid of being alone.

It does cause extreme mood swings, which is why the two are often confused, but for bipolar people it comes in the form of highs (called mania or manic episodes) and lows (depression or depressive episodes). Mania is characterised by feelings of euphoria, high energy, grandiosity, or irritability. Depressive episodes have very similar symptoms to those of depression. But the biggest difference with bpd is that these mood swings aren&rsquo;t a thing they have to deal with constantly, they usually happen every few months or less even.

It can be hard for people to maintain healthy stable relationships because of it even though they want one and are so afraid of being alone. It&rsquo;s so much more than just that though, so I do recommend everyone go and read more about it.</p><p>Bipolar disorder is very different. It does cause extreme mood swings, which is why the two are often confused, but for bipolar people it comes in the form of highs (called mania or manic episodes) and lows (depression or depressive episodes). Mania is characterised by feelings of euphoria, high energy, grandiosity, or irritability. Depressive episodes have very similar symptoms to those of depression. But the biggest difference with bpd is that these mood swings aren&rsquo;t a thing they have to deal with constantly, they usually happen every few months or less even. This means bipolar people can live very functional lives.</p><p>I saw <a href=\"https://hedaheda.tumblr.com/post/184926678087/i-see-people-being-angry-at-the-last-skames-clip\" target=\"_blank\">this post</a> earlier that I thought was very good explaining this a bit, so check it out.</p>",

Everything that isn&rsquo;t him in this clip seems to be explicitly designed to be dull and grey and annoying. We start off with a very grey shot of the courtyard and Lucas&rsquo;s demotivated answer to Daphn\u00e9&rsquo;s greeting. He enters an empty room, the girls are talking about how it smells like depression and like &ldquo;a guy died of loneliness in a corner.&rdquo; The lighting of the room is super grey as well. Two nerds show up, who probably didn&rsquo;t even come for the meeting in the first place. Lucas looks tired and absolutely fed up with life. Shot of dying leaves, Alexia popping bubbles out of boredom. The boy squad arrives and they complain about how lame it is and how they were promised girls and drinks.
