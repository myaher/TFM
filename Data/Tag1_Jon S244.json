She could already smell the burning fire outside and she could already hear her siblings giggling and laughing, making jokes no one but them really thought were funny. </p><p>Christmas was always her favorite time of the year. It was the only time all of them returned home for a few huge dinners and all those Christmas traditions they had made up over the years. </p><p>This tradition existed because of her. She had once seen it on television and she had liked the thought of it so much that she had begged her entire family to just do it, only once. But only once had turned into yearly and now it was the highlight of their celebrations.</p><p>&ldquo;Sansa?&rdquo; Jon walked into her bedroom with his arms crossed over his chest. &ldquo;Your siblings ask when you&rsquo;re coming down. They wanna get started.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still thinking about my wish.&rdquo; Sansa leaned back and a smile spread across her face. &ldquo;For years I&rsquo;ve written down the same things over and over again, but&hellip;&rdquo; She reached out her hand and a pleasant kind of warmth spread through her body when Jon grabbed it. &ldquo;All of those wishes have come true ever since I met you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All of them already?&rdquo; Jon raised his eyebrows and his cheeks colored a beautiful shade of reddish. &ldquo;You make me sound like some prince charming that came in and saved the day or something.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa took a deep breath. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean it like that and you know it!&rdquo; Sansa raised her voice and let his hand go. &ldquo;I can take care of myself perfectly fine and if I can&rsquo;t, I have four amazing siblings who can do it for me.&rdquo; She paused for a moment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not some poor cursed princess that needs saving. My parents were actually great, a little annoying at times, but that&rsquo;s normal, isn&rsquo;t it? I have a wonderful bond with my older brother, apart from those few times he teased me when I really wasn&rsquo;t in the right mood to take it. My sister and I are growing closer with every day that passes, even though we&rsquo;re completely different and sometimes seem to live in other worlds. My little brothers are adorable and ask for way too much time and attention, but I give it to them happily.&rdquo; She shrugged. &ldquo;I never needed saving, but&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Year after year she had still written that same sentence on that small piece of paper, even though she knew she had to read it out loud when she would burn it, even though she had seen her siblings roll their eyes every year. And eventually it had worked.</p><p>&ldquo;What did you wish for then?&rdquo; Jon shifted his weight from one leg to the other while he kept his glance locked with hers. He was handsome, he was thoughtful. He sometimes forgot all those small anniversaries Sansa liked to celebrate, but he always surprised her with something big on the days that really mattered. Maybe he hadn&rsquo;t really saved her life, but he had made a huge difference and had changed everything, including her as a person, for the better.</p><p>Sansa smiled once more. &ldquo;I wished for a boyfriend.&rdquo; Sansa bent her head and bit her lip. &ldquo;Not because I thought that only a boyfriend could make me happy, but just because I wanted one. I wanted to know what all those girls at school talked about. I wanted to know what kissing felt like, what real kissing felt like, when you kiss someone you actually love and who actually loves you.&rdquo;</p><p>She had kissed boys before she had met Jon. As a sophomore she had kissed Jeoffrey Baratheon. </p><p>He had seemed handsome and witty and charming and he had been the unofficial king of the school. But his looks had been deceiving. It seemed that he had only wanted to kiss her, because he enjoyed breaking hearts and making fun of the girls trying to make it through their days after he had crushed their souls and stepped on it.</p><p>A year later she had been kissed by Ramsay Bolton. </p><p>He had invited her to the schoolbal, telling her that if she really had no one to go with, he would happily come with her so she could go anyway. But he had not told her that he had wanted payment for his company. And he had not told her that this payment would cost her her dignity, her pride and her reputation.</p><p>And therefore Sansa had written down that same wish over and over again. And year after year she had watched it burn. And every time she had wished that this time it would work and that her wish for the future would finally come true. </p><p>&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re saying that now you&rsquo;ve got me, you&rsquo;ve got nothing to wish for anymore?&rdquo; Jon wrapped his arms around her and kissed her red hair. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that. You always have something to dream about, right? Just write it down. I mean, the wish doesn&rsquo;t have to come true this year already, right?&rdquo; He kissed the tip of her nose. &ldquo;You can find a new wish you can write down for the years to come.&rdquo; His lips brushed hers and then he stepped back. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take too long to come up with something, okay? We&rsquo;re all waiting for you at the bonfire.&rdquo; Jon turned around and walked away and in that moment Sansa knew exactly what to wish for.</p><p>Five minutes later she entered the garden. The evening air was cold, even for the time of the year, but the heat of the fire lured her towards it and Jon and Robb made room for her in between them. </p><p>&ldquo;Welcome to our annual Christmas Bonfire!&rdquo; Sansa raised her voice, like she had done so many years and she made sure to look at all her siblings, at her parents and lastly at her boyfriend. &ldquo;May this fire keep our wishes passionate and burning until they&rsquo;ve come true.&rdquo; She paused for a short moment and then she held her own wish above the fire. &ldquo;I wish for a future with the most amazing man I&rsquo;ve ever met. I wish for him to ask me to marry him and I wish for a few wonderful kids joining us for this ceremony one day.&rdquo; She dropped the piece of paper and the brightly colored flames licked it and consumed it until the wish was nothing but ash anymore.</p><p>Maybe her wish wouldn&rsquo;t come true in the year to come. Certainly not her entire wish would come true in the year to come, but it was exactly like Jon said. She could now use that same wish a few years, until he would ask her to marry him and until they would help their kids to write down their wishes for the annual Christmas bonfire.</p></p>",

He takes a leap of faith and Sansa makes it worth it.</small></p><p><small>Modern AU</small></p></blockquote><p>\u201cReally, Jon?\u201d Robb crossed his arms over his chest while he watched how Jon sat down on the green bench in the middle of central park. \u201cAfter all this time you still believe that that stupid woman at the fun fair was right?\u201d Robb shook his head. \u201cBut hey, whatever you want. It\u2019s your life you\u2019re throwing away.\u201d He turned around but looked over his shoulder once more before he disappeared around the corner. \u201cIf you change your mind, you know where we are, right?\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded and he opened his backpack to grab the book he was reading.</p><p>He had tried to convince himself over and over again that he should just let it go, that he was acting on the lies of a fake fortune teller. He had tried to force himself to go after Robb, to the football field to practice with the rest of the team even though the summer holiday had not ended yet and the season had not started again. He had wanted to ignore that little voice in his mind, telling him that he just had to have a little faith. </p><p>If he just had a little faith, all would be well.</p><p>At least waiting for the woman of his dreams on the old green bench in the middle of central park had done miracles for his reading challenge. During the last few months he had read more books than he had read in an entire year so far.</p><p>\u201cHey\u2026\u201d Sansa slowed down while she neared him. She had a smile on her face and her bright red hair, tied in a bun on top of her head, danced in the wind. Her forehead and skin was covered in sweat, but somehow she still looked beautiful. \u201cStill spending your afternoons here instead of with your team?\u201d</p><p>Jon looked up from his book and he nodded. \u201cWe play football all year. I just wanna do something else for a while. I\u2019ll be busy enough with the team as soon as school starts again.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if your coach will agree with your slacking and spending your time with your nose in a book instead of running and training.\u201d Sansa sat down next to him and she folded her arms around the bench to enjoy the warm rays of the sun. \u201cI know that if I\u2019d come back after the summer holiday without having at least a three miles run a day, my coach will be absolutely furious with me.\u201d</p><p>Jon closed his book and placed it next to him. \u201cI&rsquo;ve seen you running around here every day. I don\u2019t think you have anything to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d Sansa closed her eyes and leaned back to bath in the summer sun even more. Her legs were long and smooth and Jon resisted to urge to touch them with the tips of his fingers. \u201cBut if you won\u2019t get your ass of that bench soon, you will.\u201d</p><p>Jon shrugged. \u201cThere are more important things than football.\u201d Like meeting the girl of his dreams, like that fortune teller had promised him. Like running into the girl that would conquer his heart and would never let go again for the rest of their shared lives.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Sansa agreed and opened her eyes again. \u201cBut those things won\u2019t get you into college. Unless you have hidden talents I know nothing about, of course.\u201d</p><p>Jon grinned. </p><p>Sansa was a couple of years younger than him, but her confidence went way beyond the amount of confidence he would ever get himself. She knew how to walk and how to talk, but without the arrogance that most other confident girls seemed to combine with it. She had a perfect taste when it came to fashion, but without showing off that she was born into a wealthy family and had more pennies to spend than most others. And most of all: she was kind hearted, warm and welcoming, despite the fact that she was slowly growing into the queen bee of the entire school.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know everything about me, Sansa.\u201d Jon shook his head and laid out his arms on the bench too, accidentally touching Sansa\u2019s hand. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know everything about me either, Jon.\u201d Sansa stuck out her tongue and a chuckle escaped his lips. </p><p>He knew a lot more than she probably wanted him to know. It came for free with being best friends with her brother and sharing way too many details while they changed into or out of their sports attire in the locker room. Jon had never told Robb, but secretly Sansa was his favorite subject to talk about. </p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Sansa turned towards him and she crossed her legs. \u201cYou can ask me one question and I will answer honestly. In return I can ask you one question which you\u2019ll have to answer honestly.\u201d The mischievous smile on her face and the glimmering of her eyes should have given away that she was up to something, but Jon took a deep breath and decided to just take a leap of faith. Another one.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He nodded. \u201cI go first.\u201d He cocked his head and furrowed his eyebrows. The frown on his forehead deepened and a few times he opened his mouth to say something, before he closed it again because he had changed his mind.</p><p>But eventually he had to break the silence and had to come up with something. \u201cWhat\u2019s your biggest fear? And I don\u2019t mean the spider or heights kinda one.\u201d Jon almost tripped over his own words. \u201cI mean that real fear, deep down.\u201d Like not being good enough. Like never finding someone who would love him. Like being the best friend and guy next door for the rest of his life. Like never being anyone special.</p><p>Sansa\u2019s smile faded. Her confidence disappeared and for a moment she all of a sudden seemed like the young girl she still was. \u201cI fear so many things.\u201d She whispered. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that none of the dreams I had as a kid will come true, that I won\u2019t marry, that I won\u2019t become a mother, that I won\u2019t get my happily ever after.\u201d She bent her head and avoided his glance, staring at the runners running past them and the children playing in the pool. \u201cI fear falling in love, because I\u2019m afraid that he won\u2019t love me back and that I\u2019ll get my heart broken into a thousand little pieces.\u201d Sansa licked her dry lips. \u201cI fear being bullied because I\u2019m smart and intelligent. I fear guys not looking at me as dating material, because I\u2019m so much more than just a pretty dumb thing they can control and command.\u201d</p><p>Jon moved a little closer towards her. He wasn\u2019t sure if he was actually thinking about doing it, or if his body was already doing it before his mind came up with the idea. \u201cWhy would you be afraid of all those things?\u201d He shook his head in utter disbelief. \u201cAny man not loving you for who you are would be downright stupid!\u201d He raised his voice and he felt his cheeks heating up. \u201cYou&rsquo;re amazing and perfect and really\u2026\u201d Jon scratched the back of his neck. \u201cLike I said, you\u2019ll find someone.\u201d He swallowed and Sansa locked her glance with his for a short moment.</p><p>It felt as if she was attempting to look straight into his soul, but strangely enough it wasn\u2019t unpleasant or uncomfortable.

Like running into the girl that would conquer his heart and would never let go again for the rest of their shared lives.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Sansa agreed and opened her eyes again. \u201cBut those things won\u2019t get you into college. Unless you have hidden talents I know nothing about, of course.\u201d</p><p>Jon grinned. </p><p>Sansa was a couple of years younger than him, but her confidence went way beyond the amount of confidence he would ever get himself. She knew how to walk and how to talk, but without the arrogance that most other confident girls seemed to combine with it. She had a perfect taste when it came to fashion, but without showing off that she was born into a wealthy family and had more pennies to spend than most others. And most of all: she was kind hearted, warm and welcoming, despite the fact that she was slowly growing into the queen bee of the entire school.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know everything about me, Sansa.\u201d Jon shook his head and laid out his arms on the bench too, accidentally touching Sansa\u2019s hand. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know everything about me either, Jon.\u201d Sansa stuck out her tongue and a chuckle escaped his lips. </p><p>He knew a lot more than she probably wanted him to know. It came for free with being best friends with her brother and sharing way too many details while they changed into or out of their sports attire in the locker room. Jon had never told Robb, but secretly Sansa was his favorite subject to talk about. </p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Sansa turned towards him and she crossed her legs. \u201cYou can ask me one question and I will answer honestly. In return I can ask you one question which you\u2019ll have to answer honestly.\u201d The mischievous smile on her face and the glimmering of her eyes should have given away that she was up to something, but Jon took a deep breath and decided to just take a leap of faith. Another one.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He nodded. \u201cI go first.\u201d He cocked his head and furrowed his eyebrows. The frown on his forehead deepened and a few times he opened his mouth to say something, before he closed it again because he had changed his mind.</p><p>But eventually he had to break the silence and had to come up with something. \u201cWhat\u2019s your biggest fear? And I don\u2019t mean the spider or heights kinda one.\u201d Jon almost tripped over his own words. \u201cI mean that real fear, deep down.\u201d Like not being good enough. Like never finding someone who would love him. Like being the best friend and guy next door for the rest of his life. Like never being anyone special.</p><p>Sansa\u2019s smile faded. Her confidence disappeared and for a moment she all of a sudden seemed like the young girl she still was. \u201cI fear so many things.\u201d She whispered. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that none of the dreams I had as a kid will come true, that I won\u2019t marry, that I won\u2019t become a mother, that I won\u2019t get my happily ever after.\u201d She bent her head and avoided his glance, staring at the runners running past them and the children playing in the pool. \u201cI fear falling in love, because I\u2019m afraid that he won\u2019t love me back and that I\u2019ll get my heart broken into a thousand little pieces.\u201d Sansa licked her dry lips. \u201cI fear being bullied because I\u2019m smart and intelligent. I fear guys not looking at me as dating material, because I\u2019m so much more than just a pretty dumb thing they can control and command.\u201d</p><p>Jon moved a little closer towards her. He wasn\u2019t sure if he was actually thinking about doing it, or if his body was already doing it before his mind came up with the idea. \u201cWhy would you be afraid of all those things?\u201d He shook his head in utter disbelief. \u201cAny man not loving you for who you are would be downright stupid!\u201d He raised his voice and he felt his cheeks heating up. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing and perfect and really\u2026\u201d Jon scratched the back of his neck. \u201cLike I said, you\u2019ll find someone.\u201d He swallowed and Sansa locked her glance with his for a short moment.</p><p>It felt as if she was attempting to look straight into his soul, but strangely enough it wasn\u2019t unpleasant or uncomfortable. It was pleasant and nice and filled with curiosity.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the true reason you spend every day of your summer holiday here on this specific bench?\u201d Sansa changed the subject all of a sudden and Jon cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cHonestly?\u201d</p><p>Sansa rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cRemember that fortune teller on that fun fair at the end of the school year?\u201d Jon waited until Sansa nodded. \u201cShe read the palm of my hand and told me that I\u2019d meet the girl of my dreams and my future wife here, in central park, right in the middle.\u201d He shrugged his shoulders. \u201cIt sounds kinda stupid, but this bench is right in the middle and I thought, it doesn\u2019t hurt to try and have a little faith, right?\u201d</p><p>Sansa\u2019s lips curled up into a smile. \u201cDid you meet her yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou only got to ask one question.\u201d Jon whispered. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do one more.\u201d Sansa cocked her head. \u201cDid you already meet her?\u201d</p><p>Jon thought about it for a short moment. \u201cI guess I did meet the girl of my dreams, yeah.

I fear guys not looking at me as dating material, because I\u2019m so much more than just a pretty dumb thing they can control and command.\u201d</p><p>Jon moved a little closer towards her. He wasn\u2019t sure if he was actually thinking about doing it, or if his body was already doing it before his mind came up with the idea. \u201cWhy would you be afraid of all those things?\u201d He shook his head in utter disbelief. \u201cAny man not loving you for who you are would be downright stupid!\u201d He raised his voice and he felt his cheeks heating up. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing and perfect and really\u2026\u201d Jon scratched the back of his neck. \u201cLike I said, you\u2019ll find someone.\u201d He swallowed and Sansa locked her glance with his for a short moment.</p><p>It felt as if she was attempting to look straight into his soul, but strangely enough it wasn\u2019t unpleasant or uncomfortable. It was pleasant and nice and filled with curiosity.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the true reason you spend every day of your summer holiday here on this specific bench?\u201d Sansa changed the subject all of a sudden and Jon cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cHonestly?\u201d</p><p>Sansa rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cRemember that fortune teller on that fun fair at the end of the school year?\u201d Jon waited until Sansa nodded. \u201cShe read the palm of my hand and told me that I\u2019d meet the girl of my dreams and my future wife here, in central park, right in the middle.\u201d He shrugged his shoulders. \u201cIt sounds kinda stupid, but this bench is right in the middle and I thought, it doesn\u2019t hurt to try and have a little faith, right?\u201d</p><p>Sansa\u2019s lips curled up into a smile. \u201cDid you meet her yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou only got to ask one question.\u201d Jon whispered. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do one more.\u201d Sansa cocked her head. \u201cDid you already meet her?\u201d</p><p>Jon thought about it for a short moment. \u201cI guess I did meet the girl of my dreams, yeah. I just don\u2019t know if she wants to be.\u201d He avoided her glance and nervously his fingers tapped on the old wood of the bench. </p><p>\u201cAsk her.\u201d Sansa spoke firmly and with a shock Jon looked up. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have one more question to ask. Just ask her.\u201d Sansa smiled and Jon felt his heart hammering in his chest. </p><p>He kinda knew that she wouldn\u2019t let him ask the question if she was gonna break his heart or something, but still he had to gather all his courage to actually say the words out loud. \u201cSo\u2026\u201d He coughed and cleared his throat. \u201cWould you wanna go out with me and see if you\u2019re the girl I\u2019m gonna marry one day?\u201d</p><p>Sansa laughed, her laugh sounding more beautiful than the best song Jon had ever heard. \u201cYes.\u201d She wrapped her arms around his neck and pecked his cheek. \u201cPick me up at 7 tonight. I\u2019ll make sure to have taken a shower.\u201d</p><p>Before Jon could reply Sansa had already stood up and continued her run through the park.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to\u2026\u201d He said, even though she couldn\u2019t hear him anymore. \u201cI like you anyway.\u201d</p></p>",

It&rsquo;s your life you&rsquo;re throwing away.&rdquo; He turned around but looked over his shoulder once more before he disappeared around the corner. &ldquo;If you change your mind, you know where we are, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Jon nodded and he opened his backpack to grab the book he was reading.</p><p>He had tried to convince himself over and over again that he should just let it go, that he was acting on the lies of a fake fortune teller. He had tried to force himself to go after Robb, to the football field to practice with the rest of the team even though the summer holiday had not ended yet and the season had not started again. He had wanted to ignore that little voice in his mind, telling him that he just had to have a little faith. </p><p>If he just had a little faith, all would be well.</p><p>At least waiting for the woman of his dreams on the old green bench in the middle of central park had done miracles for his reading challenge. During the last few months he had read more books than he had read in an entire year so far.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey&hellip;&rdquo; Sansa slowed down while she neared him. She had a smile on her face and her bright red hair, tied in a bun on top of her head, danced in the wind. Her forehead and skin was covered in sweat, but somehow she still looked beautiful. &ldquo;Still spending your afternoons here instead of with your team?&rdquo;</p><p>Jon looked up from his book and he nodded. &ldquo;We play football all year. I just wanna do something else for a while. I&rsquo;ll be busy enough with the team as soon as school starts again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure if your coach will agree with your slacking and spending your time with your nose in a book instead of running and training.&rdquo; Sansa sat down next to him and she folded her arms around the bench to enjoy the warm rays of the sun. &ldquo;I know that if I&rsquo;d come back after the summer holiday without having at least a three miles run a day, my coach will be absolutely furious with me.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon closed his book and placed it next to him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen you running around here every day. I don&rsquo;t think you have anything to worry about.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Sansa closed her eyes and leaned back to bath in the summer sun even more. Her legs were long and smooth and Jon resisted to urge to touch them with the tips of his fingers. &ldquo;But if you won&rsquo;t get your ass of that bench soon, you will.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon shrugged. &ldquo;There are more important things than football.&rdquo; Like meeting the girl of his dreams, like that fortune teller had promised him. Like running into the girl that would conquer his heart and would never let go again for the rest of their shared lives.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo; Sansa agreed and opened her eyes again. &ldquo;But those things won&rsquo;t get you into college. Unless you have hidden talents I know nothing about, of course.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon grinned. </p><p>Sansa was a couple of years younger than him, but her confidence went way beyond the amount of confidence he would ever get himself. She knew how to walk and how to talk, but without the arrogance that most other confident girls seemed to combine with it. She had a perfect taste when it came to fashion, but without showing off that she was born into a wealthy family and had more pennies to spend than most others. And most of all: she was kind hearted, warm and welcoming, despite the fact that she was slowly growing into the queen bee of the entire school.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know everything about me, Sansa.&rdquo; Jon shook his head and laid out his arms on the bench too, accidentally touching Sansa&rsquo;s hand. </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know everything about me either, Jon.&rdquo; Sansa stuck out her tongue and a chuckle escaped his lips. </p><p>He knew a lot more than she probably wanted him to know. It came for free with being best friends with her brother and sharing way too many details while they changed into or out of their sports attire in the locker room. Jon had never told Robb, but secretly Sansa was his favorite subject to talk about. </p><p>&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; Sansa turned towards him and she crossed her legs. &ldquo;You can ask me one question and I will answer honestly. In return I can ask you one question which you&rsquo;ll have to answer honestly.&rdquo; The mischievous smile on her face and the glimmering of her eyes should have given away that she was up to something, but Jon took a deep breath and decided to just take a leap of faith. Another one.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; He nodded. &ldquo;I go first.&rdquo; He cocked his head and furrowed his eyebrows. The frown on his forehead deepened and a few times he opened his mouth to say something, before he closed it again because he had changed his mind.</p><p>But eventually he had to break the silence and had to come up with something. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your biggest fear? And I don&rsquo;t mean the spider or heights kinda one.&rdquo; Jon almost tripped over his own words. &ldquo;I mean that real fear, deep down.&rdquo; Like not being good enough. Like never finding someone who would love him. Like being the best friend and guy next door for the rest of his life. Like never being anyone special.</p><p>Sansa&rsquo;s smile faded. Her confidence disappeared and for a moment she all of a sudden seemed like the young girl she still was. &ldquo;I fear so many things.&rdquo; She whispered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that none of the dreams I had as a kid will come true, that I won&rsquo;t marry, that I won&rsquo;t become a mother, that I won&rsquo;t get my happily ever after.&rdquo; She bent her head and avoided his glance, staring at the runners running past them and the children playing in the pool. &ldquo;I fear falling in love, because I&rsquo;m afraid that he won&rsquo;t love me back and that I&rsquo;ll get my heart broken into a thousand little pieces.&rdquo; Sansa licked her dry lips. &ldquo;I fear being bullied because I&rsquo;m smart and intelligent.
