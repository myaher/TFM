Please note, I do not and will not base any of these descriptions in folklore or legend. The beauty of fantasy fiction is, well, you can do pretty much whatever you want. So everything you read will come completely from my own mind, with as little influence as possible from the outside world. In the next post after that, we begin our long and powerful journey with The Entities. Let the magic begin!</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"4\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure></p>",

When he shot her a look and resumed tapping, she couldn\u2019t carry on and instead finally lost it, bursting out with a laugh that had her doubling over in her chair, holding her stomach as her eyes watered.</p>\n\n<p>\u201dOh, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she wheezed, looking like a right loon. \u201dIt\u2019s just\u2026 I never realized how terribly annoying it must have been to share lessons with me as a child. Ah-and you\u2026 You sounded j-just like when Bi-Binns would go off on a t-tangent talking to the bloody wall!\u201d Hermione could barely speak for the laughter that the memories invoked. She recalled the lessons when Binns would blather on and on, not even facing his often-sleeping class, and Jaxon would be complaining under his breath or mimicking the ghostly professor or doing some other antics to entertain his classmates. \u201dMerlin, I used to threaten you with so many docked points and detentions for that\u2026\u201d</p>",

Marigold was having breakfast when she overheard some Hufflepuff girls talk about what happened last night. As soon as Aster\u2019s name was brought up, Marigold jumped and ran to them, asking what happened and where was Aster now. They only said a monster had attacked them and Aster wasn\u2019t quick enough to run. </p><p>Marigold bolted from the dining hall toward the infirmary, ignoring all the Prefects who began docking Gryffindor points for running in the Halls. </p><p>Around the same time, Vivien was doing a book report when Lottie ran into the library and informed her of what happened to Aster. Lottie had overhear from some Hufflepuffs in the library of some creature sneaking into the Hufflepuff dorms and attacking Aster while she slept. Vivien jumped up and the two girls started to run toward the infirmary. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Aster laid on the infirmary bed, unconscious and pale. Marigold had to force her way inside. The story of a unknown creature attacking a student was one that no one wanted to miss. They expected Aster to be deformed and bandaged up, and much to everyone\u2019s disappointment, she was physically fine. </p><p>When one hears that a student is attacked by some unknown creature, they want to see grotesque scars at the very least! </p><p>Vivien and Lottie arrived at the infirmary moments after Marigold forced herself in. Poppy, the school\u2019s nurse, kept students away because at the time, Aster was in a state of shock and only just a few moments ago was she given a sleeping and dreamless draught to ease her mind and allow her to rest. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here Marigold?\u201d Vivien asked with some attitude but this was more out of protectiveness. Vivien had seen how Marigold bullied Aster earlier this year and she didn\u2019t know that the two girls had made up. </p><p>\u201cI heard Aster was attacked!\u201d Marigold screamed in full concern. </p><p>\u201cGirls!\u201d Poppy was stern, \u201cif you cannot keep your voices down, you will leave. She needs her rest.\u201d</p><p>Lottie asked, \u201cwhat happened to her? Was she really attacked by a monster?\u201d Fear was laced in her voice. All the girls looked at Poppy with some fear for their friend. </p><p>Poppy shook her head, \u201cI can\u2019t reveal what happened. We\u2019re still trying to figure it out ourselves. But she hadn\u2019t slept all night and she was in shock when she was brought in. Physically she\u2019s okay,\u201d Poppy said and sighs of relief was heard from Marigold and Lottie. Vivien however didn\u2019t relax, \u201cbut what about her mind?\u201d</p><p>Poppy shook her head, \u201cshe was in shock and crying hysterically. Poor girl couldn\u2019t even finish her sentences. She just kept babbling.\u201d</p><p>Marigold sat down on the bed, pulling Aster\u2019s head in her lap. This freaked out Lottie and Vivien greatly. \u201cExcuse you! What do you think you are doing?\u201d Vivien asked, her face red with angry. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to comfort her. She\u2019s still tense,\u201d Marigold said, pointed to Aster\u2019s hands, which had been gripping the blanket from underneath. Lottie looked at Marigold, seemingly understanding the subconscious mind. Seeing how much Aster had visibly relaxed just after being in Marigold\u2019s arms, Lottie asked, \u201chow long?\u201d</p><p>Vivien raised an eyebrow, but looked at Marigold. The red hair stared hard at the two girls, \u201csince we both got Dragon Pox in December.\u201d Lottie sighed softly, and sat on the foot of the bed, and pulled out a book that she had almost forgotten that she had on her. It was old and torn up, but it was Jerry Bloomer, the first book in the series, \u201cthat\u2019s Aster\u2019s favorite book. Some people can unconsciously hear when people read to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLottie, what are you doing?\u201d Vivien asked. </p><p>\u201cOffering some comfort for our friend,\u201d she stared at Vivien hard, something she wasn\u2019t used to doing. \u201cAster needs support, she doesn\u2019t need us to fight. Just look around. We\u2019re the only ones she\u2019s got.\u201d</p><p>Vivien looked around and did notice it was just then plus Poppy, who was letting the girls sort things out. \u201cHey&hellip;where is Sam and Ace anyways?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam is taking class notes for me and I guess for all of us,\u201d Lottie said and looked around the room. \u201cAnd Ace&hellip;well, since he\u2019s in Hufflepuff as well, he\u2019s being talked to about what happened last night. All the students in the house all woke up and many of them freaked out. Some even claim to have seen the monster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why isn\u2019t James here?\u201d Marigold suddenly asked, laying her down for a moment but only to move so that she could lay down with her on the bed. </p><p>\u201cIf you knew Aster, you would know that James can\u2019t stand her,\u201d Vivien said and then really got mad, \u201cwhy are you laying down with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVivi, look,\u201d Lottie stopped her and saw his Marigold turned Aster to her side and began hugging her from behind. Lottie held the book in her hands and said, \u201cdo you care if I start reading to her? This really is her favorite story. <i>Jerry Bloomer and the Heart-Stone</i>. </p><p>Vivien pouted a bit as Lottie was getting set up. That was until she decided to sit down beside the bed, and pulled out her wand, pulling the curtains around then to be closed off. Vivien looked at Lottie, \u201cstart reading the book Lottie. We only have until lunch and then we have to go to class,\u201d she said as she glared at Marigold, still not trusting her to being so close to her best friend. </p><p>Lottie nodded and opened the book and began reading, \u201cMr. and Mrs. Hayworth, of number seven, Rutledge Road, we\u2019re proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much&hellip;\u201d</p>",

She needs her rest.\u201d</p><p>Lottie asked, \u201cwhat happened to her? Was she really attacked by a monster?\u201d Fear was laced in her voice. All the girls looked at Poppy with some fear for their friend. </p><p>Poppy shook her head, \u201cI can\u2019t reveal what happened. We\u2019re still trying to figure it out ourselves. But she hadn\u2019t slept all night and she was in shock when she was brought in. Physically she\u2019s okay,\u201d Poppy said and sighs of relief was heard from Marigold and Lottie. Vivien however didn\u2019t relax, \u201cbut what about her mind?\u201d</p><p>Poppy shook her head, \u201cshe was in shock and crying hysterically. Poor girl couldn\u2019t even finish her sentences. She just kept babbling.\u201d</p><p>Marigold sat down on the bed, pulling Aster\u2019s head in her lap. This freaked out Lottie and Vivien greatly. \u201cExcuse you! What do you think you are doing?\u201d Vivien asked, her face red with angry. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to comfort her. She\u2019s still tense,\u201d Marigold said, pointed to Aster\u2019s hands, which had been gripping the blanket from underneath. Lottie looked at Marigold, seemingly understanding the subconscious mind. Seeing how much Aster had visibly relaxed just after being in Marigold\u2019s arms, Lottie asked, \u201chow long?\u201d</p><p>Vivien raised an eyebrow, but looked at Marigold. The red hair stared hard at the two girls, \u201csince we both got Dragon Pox in December.\u201d Lottie sighed softly, and sat on the foot of the bed, and pulled out a book that she had almost forgotten that she had on her. It was old and torn up, but it was Jerry Bloomer, the first book in the series, \u201cthat\u2019s Aster\u2019s favorite book. Some people can unconsciously hear when people read to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLottie, what are you doing?\u201d Vivien asked. </p><p>\u201cOffering some comfort for our friend,\u201d she stared at Vivien hard, something she wasn\u2019t used to doing. \u201cAster needs support, she doesn\u2019t need us to fight. Just look around. We\u2019re the only ones she\u2019s got.\u201d</p><p>Vivien looked around and did notice it was just then plus Poppy, who was letting the girls sort things out. \u201cHey\u2026where is Sam and Ace anyways?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam is taking class notes for me and I guess for all of us,\u201d Lottie said and looked around the room. \u201cAnd Ace\u2026well, since he\u2019s in Hufflepuff as well, he\u2019s being talked to about what happened last night. All the students in the house all woke up and many of them freaked out. Some even claim to have seen the monster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why isn\u2019t James here?\u201d Marigold suddenly asked, laying her down for a moment but only to move so that she could lay down with her on the bed. </p><p>\u201cIf you knew Aster, you would know that James can\u2019t stand her,\u201d Vivien said and then really got mad, \u201cwhy are you laying down with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVivi, look,\u201d Lottie stopped her and saw his Marigold turned Aster to her side and began hugging her from behind. Lottie held the book in her hands and said, \u201cdo you care if I start reading to her? This really is her favorite story. <i>Jerry Bloomer and the Heart-Stone</i>. </p><p>Vivien pouted a bit as Lottie was getting set up. That was until she decided to sit down beside the bed, and pulled out her wand, pulling the curtains around then to be closed off. Vivien looked at Lottie, \u201cstart reading the book Lottie. We only have until lunch and then we have to go to class,\u201d she said as she glared at Marigold, still not trusting her to being so close to her best friend. </p><p>Lottie nodded and opened the book and began reading, \u201cMr. and Mrs. Hayworth, of number seven, Rutledge Road, we\u2019re proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much\u2026\u201d</p>",

Marigold was having breakfast when she overheard some Hufflepuff girls talk about what happened last night. As soon as Aster&rsquo;s name was brought up, Marigold jumped and ran to them, asking what happened and where was Aster now. They only said a monster had attacked them and Aster wasn&rsquo;t quick enough to run. </p><p>Marigold bolted from the dining hall toward the infirmary, ignoring all the Prefects who began docking Gryffindor points for running in the Halls. </p><p>Around the same time, Vivien was doing a book report when Lottie ran into the library and informed her of what happened to Aster. Lottie had overhear from some Hufflepuffs in the library of some creature sneaking into the Hufflepuff dorms and attacking Aster while she slept. Vivien jumped up and the two girls started to run toward the infirmary. </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Aster laid on the infirmary bed, unconscious and pale. Marigold had to force her way inside. The story of a unknown creature attacking a student was one that no one wanted to miss. They expected Aster to be deformed and bandaged up, and much to everyone&rsquo;s disappointment, she was physically fine. </p><p>When one hears that a student is attacked by some unknown creature, they want to see grotesque scars at the very least! </p><p>Vivien and Lottie arrived at the infirmary moments after Marigold forced herself in. Poppy, the school&rsquo;s nurse, kept students away because at the time, Aster was in a state of shock and only just a few moments ago was she given a sleeping and dreamless draught to ease her mind and allow her to rest. </p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing here Marigold?&rdquo; Vivien asked with some attitude but this was more out of protectiveness.

And somehow Harry finds out and decides to be a &ldquo;Protective Older Brother&rdquo; and gives the TALK to his sister and also goes into Big Brother mode at Ron. -\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"http://princessroselyn.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">princessroselyn</a>\u00a0<br/><br/>Warning: Awkwardness- but this was given, Mentions the nasty ;)</p><p>Italics: Past</p><p>Y/N: Your name</p><hr><p>It was a Friday morning and you were having breakfast at the Gryffindor table with your brother Harry and both your best friend\u2019s Ron and Hermione. Even though you were a year younger than Harry, you grew accustom to always having the two around and naturally formed a bond with them. However as time passed, you grew<i> really accustom</i> to the ginger haired boy who we all call Ron Weasley. Something about him made you feel drawn to his persona and the feeling was mutual.\u00a0</p><p>However, there was one slight problem.</p><p><i>Harry</i>.</p><!-- more --><p>Harry was your best friend, but so is Ron. You didn\u2019t know how your older brother would feel that his little sister is dating his best friend. Especially with his overprotectiveness. You know he means well, but you don\u2019t have any other choice but to hide it. It was for the best. Both for you <i>and </i>him.</p><p>You remember the very day that Ron asked you to be his girlfriend like it was yesterday:</p><p><i>It was Christmas time and Harry and Hermione had left to bring back butter beer for everyone. You had on your ugly sweater and sat in front of the fire warming your hands as the cold snowy weather fell from outside. You closed your eyes in bliss, as you were very very cold. You heard Ron chuckle from behind you, and you whipped your head around, giving him a playful glare.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat are you laughing at, Carrot-top?\u201d you teased. He smiled and began to fidget with his thumbs.<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cOh nothing, just admiring you being dramatic about the weather as always,\u201d he retorted. You gasped, and threw your hand to your chest.<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cDramatic! I am anemic and possibly get hypothermia!\u201d you joked. He rolled his eyes.<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cExactly my point, Drama Queen,\u201d he smirked. You huffed and returned back to the fire, muttering a\u00a0\u2018whatever.\u2019<br/></i></p><p><i>Ron made his way over to you and sat down, in front of the fire.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cCome to gloat some more?\u201d you sighed and rested your head on his shoulders. A blush rose to his pale cheeks.<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cN-No, uhm actually, I wanted to ask you something, Y/N,\u201d he nervously spoke. You raised your head and looked at him, tilting your head slightly, raising your eyebrow.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; You asked softly. You noticed Ron nervously nibbling on the inside of his lip as he took a shaky breath. Furrowing your eyebrows, you put your hand on top of his, to calm him down. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Well.. I don\u2019t know how this is going to go and if I am pressuring you or making you feel uncomfortable in any way, do let me know and I will stop,\u201d he spoke, only making you more confused by the second, but you nodded, \u201cHere goes nothing. Y/N you&rsquo;re beautiful. Gorgeous, a Goddess, absolutely stunning, bloody brilliant! Your laugh is like music to my ears and every time you smile you make the whole room light up. I swear to it, my heart skips a beat whenever I am in your presence. Just brilliant. You&rsquo;re so caring and generous in almost every instance.. and I just don&rsquo;t understand how you do it, but you do. I&rsquo;m so blessed to have met you, even if it is through Harry, because you are truly a blessing in my life. Your personality is beyond extravagant. It&rsquo;s just&hellip; so&hellip; unique. It&rsquo;s brilliant. Bloody brilliant, really. You are brilliant. But, what I&rsquo;m trying to say is, would you like to be my girlfriend?&rdquo; He gushed.</i></p><p><i>You stared at the red-headed boy for a minute. His face was almost as red as his hair. You threw yourself forward, crashing your lips onto his. Taken back by surprise, Ron almost feel backwards, but caught you in his arms. As you pulled away, you smiled.</i></p><p><i>\u201cS-So, is that a yes?\u201d he blushed.</i><br/></p><p>Ron is an awkward person, but so are you in some ways so it evens out perfectly. Currently, All four of you, Harry, Hermione, Ron, and you, are hanging around Diagon Alley, just enjoy each others company.</p><p>\u201cOh, look, Ron! It\u2019s your brothers shop Weasley\u2019s Wizard Wheezes!\u201d you gawk,\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s go inside!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing but a bunch of rubbish,\u201d Ron mumbled. You rolled your eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, c\u2019mon. Don\u2019t be such a sleaze,\u201d Hermione joined in, and linked arms with you, walking towards the shop. Ron looked at Harry and he shrugged.<br/></p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have a look,\u201d Harry said.<br/></p><p>You all entered and looked around amazed at your surroundings.\u00a0The shop contained practical joke objects, such as Extendable Ears, a Reusable Hangman, Skiving Snackboxes, and Fred and George&rsquo;s special WonderWitch products, such as; Love Potions, Ten-Second Pimple Vanishers, Pygmy Puffs, and more. You squealed in excitement and hopped up the stairs to look around.</p><p>You found a hat floating above you and placed perfectly on top of your head. It began to purr and you giggled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Titfer-Wanderer. It\u2019s seems to have taken a liking to you,\u201d George appeared, grinning at you. You raised your arm and began to lightly pet the hat and it vibrated in joy.<br/></p><p>\u201cHello, little Potter,\u201d Fred spoke, on the opposite side of you that George was. You gave them both a big hug. They were like your second brothers from another mother.<br/></p><p>\u201cNice store you\u2019ve got going on here, you smiled as the Titfer floated off of your head and to somewhere else in the store.<br/></p><p>\u201cWe know,\u201d they said in unison. They tend to do that a lot,\u00a0\u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust taking a gander,\u201d you replied as Ron showed up next to you.<br/></p><p>\u201cWell, isn\u2019t it our younger brother,\u201d Fred joked, roughly slapping Ron on the back. He groaned, annoyed.<br/></p><p>\u201cCan we go,\u201d Ron said, turning to you. You huffed and nodded.<br/></p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d you pouted and linked arms with Ron. George eyed you both up and down, noticing how comfortable Ron was acting with you. He elbowed Fred in the ribs slightly and gestured to the two of you slightly. Fred also looked at you two and squinted his eyes. Usually, Ron was always shy around you and wouldn\u2019t dare get too close enough to touch you, let alone link arms.<br/></p><p>\u201cSee you, Fred and George,\u201d you smiled as Ron pulled you away.<br/></p><p>\u201cMhmm&hellip;,\u201d they said in unison, watching the two of you leave the store.<br/></p><hr><p>Ron pulled you around the corner of the building as Harry and Hermione were still inside.\u00a0\u201cThey tried to charge me full price for a small orb, can you believe it? I\u201dm their brother,\u201d he complained.</p><p>You gave a little smirk.\u00a0\u201cWell, to be fair, they are trying to make business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it was one teeny little orb. They\u2019re bonkers to think I\u2019m paying $45 for it.\u201d You gave a little laugh and wrapped your arms around his neck, leaning into his touch as he grabbed your waist. You pressed your lips to his as he deepened the kiss.<br/></p><p>\u201cBLOODY HELL!\u201d<br/></p><p>You and Ron immediately pulled away as you\u00a0 both turned towards the loud outburst. You blushed, scratching the side of your head as you looked into your brother\u2019s shocked eyes. Next to him stood Fred and George, grinning.</p><p>\u201cGood luck with that one, little brother and little Potter,\u201d they joked and walked back inside, winking.<br/></p><p>\u201cDoes anyone care to explain what\u2019s going on?!\u201d Harry exclaimed. Ron, was at a loss of words. What was he going to tell his best friend? You decided to speak up.<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what it looks like,\u201d you began.<br/></p><p>\u201cOh really, so my best friend and little sister were not just snogging a couple seconds ago?\u201d he retorted. You cringed at his tone of voice.<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay- it\u2019s exactly what it looks like, BUT-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBack to Hogwarts in the Gryffindor common room. Now,\u201d Harry demanded and walked away.<br/></p><p>You sighed and looked up at Ron. He looked back down at you with a worried expression.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who wanted to come here,\u201d he mumbled. You gasped.<br/></p><p>\u201cExcuse me, you\u2019re the one who pulled me outside to snog-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d Harry snapped. You both hung your head, and trailed behind. Hermione came skipping out the store, completely oblivious to what happened seconds ago.<br/></p><hr><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d Harry spoke, sitting across from the both of you in the Gryffindor common room. He didn\u2019t break eye contact once, with the either of you.<br/></p><p>\u201cJust a couple months,\u201d Ron spoke.<br/></p><p>\u201cHow. Long?\u201d he asked again.<br/></p><p>\u201cFour months,\u201d you finished, playing with your thumbs. Harry took a deep breath, leaning into the both of his hands. He then rubbed his hands down his face and looked at you in dead silence. All the three of you could do was awkwardly stare.<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay. We are going to talk about where babies come from. Do you know anything about intercourse?\u201d Harry began. Ron groaned, completely embarrassed.<br/></p><p>\u201cOh for goodness sakes, Harry! I\u2019ve been getting my bloody period for six years!\u201d you exclaimed, hiding your face in your hands, mortified that he even brought up this type of discussion.<br/></p><p>\u201cYes, I very well know this, but you guys must understand that you are going to get&hellip; erm.. sexual impulses and want to act upon them. And it\u2019s completely natural! But I am going to say this as your brother, Y/N, and your best friend, Ron, ignore them!\u201d he snapped. You groaned in embarrassment as Ron could do nothing but fiddle with his thumbs.<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not just talking about intercourse. Ron, I know you are going to try and do vile things to my little sister. <i>Just vile!</i> But I\u2019m telling you this right now, you must also control these impulses towards other sexual acts.

You\u2019re so caring and generous in almost every instance.. and I just don\u2019t understand how you do it, but you do. I\u2019m so blessed to have met you, even if it is through Harry, because you are truly a blessing in my life. Your personality is beyond extravagant. It\u2019s just\u2026 so\u2026 unique. It\u2019s brilliant. Bloody brilliant, really. You are brilliant. But, what I\u2019m trying to say is, would you like to be my girlfriend?\u201d He gushed.</i></p><p><i>You stared at the red-headed boy for a minute. His face was almost as red as his hair.

As you pulled away, you smiled.</i></p><p><i>\u201cS-So, is that a yes?\u201d he blushed.</i><br></p><p>Ron is an awkward person, but so are you in some ways so it evens out perfectly. Currently, All four of you, Harry, Hermione, Ron, and you, are hanging around Diagon Alley, just enjoy each others company.</p><p>\u201cOh, look, Ron! It\u2019s your brothers shop Weasley\u2019s Wizard Wheezes!\u201d you gawk,\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s go inside!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing but a bunch of rubbish,\u201d Ron mumbled. You rolled your eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, c\u2019mon. Don\u2019t be such a sleaze,\u201d Hermione joined in, and linked arms with you, walking towards the shop. Ron looked at Harry and he shrugged.<br></p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have a look,\u201d Harry said.<br></p><p>You all entered and looked around amazed at your surroundings.\u00a0The shop contained practical joke objects, such as Extendable Ears, a Reusable Hangman, Skiving Snackboxes, and Fred and George\u2019s special WonderWitch products, such as; Love Potions, Ten-Second Pimple Vanishers, Pygmy Puffs, and more. You squealed in excitement and hopped up the stairs to look around.</p><p>You found a hat floating above you and placed perfectly on top of your head. It began to purr and you giggled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Titfer-Wanderer. It\u2019s seems to have taken a liking to you,\u201d George appeared, grinning at you. You raised your arm and began to lightly pet the hat and it vibrated in joy.<br></p><p>\u201cHello, little Potter,\u201d Fred spoke, on the opposite side of you that George was. You gave them both a big hug. They were like your second brothers from another mother.<br></p><p>\u201cNice store you\u2019ve got going on here, you smiled as the Titfer floated off of your head and to somewhere else in the store.<br></p><p>\u201cWe know,\u201d they said in unison. They tend to do that a lot,\u00a0\u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust taking a gander,\u201d you replied as Ron showed up next to you.<br></p><p>\u201cWell, isn\u2019t it our younger brother,\u201d Fred joked, roughly slapping Ron on the back. He groaned, annoyed.<br></p><p>\u201cCan we go,\u201d Ron said, turning to you. You huffed and nodded.<br></p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d you pouted and linked arms with Ron. George eyed you both up and down, noticing how comfortable Ron was acting with you. He elbowed Fred in the ribs slightly and gestured to the two of you slightly. Fred also looked at you two and squinted his eyes. Usually, Ron was always shy around you and wouldn\u2019t dare get too close enough to touch you, let alone link arms.<br></p><p>\u201cSee you, Fred and George,\u201d you smiled as Ron pulled you away.<br></p><p>\u201cMhmm\u2026,\u201d they said in unison, watching the two of you leave the store.<br></p><hr><p>Ron pulled you around the corner of the building as Harry and Hermione were still inside.\u00a0\u201cThey tried to charge me full price for a small orb, can you believe it? I\u201dm their brother,\u201d he complained.</p><p>You gave a little smirk.\u00a0\u201cWell, to be fair, they are trying to make business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it was one teeny little orb. They\u2019re bonkers to think I\u2019m paying $45 for it.\u201d You gave a little laugh and wrapped your arms around his neck, leaning into his touch as he grabbed your waist. You pressed your lips to his as he deepened the kiss.<br></p><p>\u201cBLOODY HELL!\u201d<br></p><p>You and Ron immediately pulled away as you\u00a0 both turned towards the loud outburst. You blushed, scratching the side of your head as you looked into your brother\u2019s shocked eyes. Next to him stood Fred and George, grinning.</p><p>\u201cGood luck with that one, little brother and little Potter,\u201d they joked and walked back inside, winking.<br></p><p>\u201cDoes anyone care to explain what\u2019s going on?!\u201d Harry exclaimed. Ron, was at a loss of words. What was he going to tell his best friend? You decided to speak up.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what it looks like,\u201d you began.<br></p><p>\u201cOh really, so my best friend and little sister were not just snogging a couple seconds ago?\u201d he retorted. You cringed at his tone of voice.<br></p><p>\u201cOkay- it\u2019s exactly what it looks like, BUT-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBack to Hogwarts in the Gryffindor common room. Now,\u201d Harry demanded and walked away.<br></p><p>You sighed and looked up at Ron. He looked back down at you with a worried expression.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who wanted to come here,\u201d he mumbled. You gasped.<br></p><p>\u201cExcuse me, you\u2019re the one who pulled me outside to snog-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d Harry snapped. You both hung your head, and trailed behind. Hermione came skipping out the store, completely oblivious to what happened seconds ago.<br></p><hr><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d Harry spoke, sitting across from the both of you in the Gryffindor common room. He didn\u2019t break eye contact once, with the either of you.<br></p><p>\u201cJust a couple months,\u201d Ron spoke.<br></p><p>\u201cHow. Long?\u201d he asked again.<br></p><p>\u201cFour months,\u201d you finished, playing with your thumbs. Harry took a deep breath, leaning into the both of his hands. He then rubbed his hands down his face and looked at you in dead silence. All the three of you could do was awkwardly stare.<br></p><p>\u201cOkay. We are going to talk about where babies come from. Do you know anything about intercourse?\u201d Harry began. Ron groaned, completely embarrassed.<br></p><p>\u201cOh for goodness sakes, Harry! I\u2019ve been getting my bloody period for six years!\u201d you exclaimed, hiding your face in your hands, mortified that he even brought up this type of discussion.<br></p><p>\u201cYes, I very well know this, but you guys must understand that you are going to get\u2026 erm.. sexual impulses and want to act upon them. And it\u2019s completely natural! But I am going to say this as your brother, Y/N, and your best friend, Ron, ignore them!\u201d he snapped. You groaned in embarrassment as Ron could do nothing but fiddle with his thumbs.<br></p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not just talking about intercourse. Ron, I know you are going to try and do vile things to my little sister. <i>Just vile!</i> But I\u2019m telling you this right now, you must also control these impulses towards other sexual acts. This goes for you too Y/N. Things such as masterbating, blowjo-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHARRY!\u201d you shouted,\u00a0\u201cBLOODY STOP!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You couldn\u2019t take anymore. This had to stop. You looked at Ron and he couldn\u2019t have looked more awkward. His face was as red as a tomato, and if it had gotten anymore red, you were sure he was going to explode.<br></p><p>\u201cMake it stop,\u201d you moaned.\u00a0\u201cI am going to leave if you continue.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNext time, I expect you to inform me of something like this happening and this all could have been avoided,\u201d Harry shrugged, putting his hands up in defense.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, we get it.

Currently, All four of you, Harry, Hermione, Ron, and you, are hanging around Diagon Alley, just enjoy each others company.</p><p>\u201cOh, look, Ron! It\u2019s your brothers shop Weasley\u2019s Wizard Wheezes!\u201d you gawk,\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s go inside!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing but a bunch of rubbish,\u201d Ron mumbled. You rolled your eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, c\u2019mon. Don\u2019t be such a sleaze,\u201d Hermione joined in, and linked arms with you, walking towards the shop. Ron looked at Harry and he shrugged.<br></p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have a look,\u201d Harry said.<br></p><p>You all entered and looked around amazed at your surroundings.\u00a0The shop contained practical joke objects, such as Extendable Ears, a Reusable Hangman, Skiving Snackboxes, and Fred and George\u2019s special WonderWitch products, such as; Love Potions, Ten-Second Pimple Vanishers, Pygmy Puffs, and more. You squealed in excitement and hopped up the stairs to look around.</p><p>You found a hat floating above you and placed perfectly on top of your head. It began to purr and you giggled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Titfer-Wanderer. It\u2019s seems to have taken a liking to you,\u201d George appeared, grinning at you. You raised your arm and began to lightly pet the hat and it vibrated in joy.<br></p><p>\u201cHello, little Potter,\u201d Fred spoke, on the opposite side of you that George was. You gave them both a big hug. They were like your second brothers from another mother.<br></p><p>\u201cNice store you\u2019ve got going on here, you smiled as the Titfer floated off of your head and to somewhere else in the store.<br></p><p>\u201cWe know,\u201d they said in unison. They tend to do that a lot,\u00a0\u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust taking a gander,\u201d you replied as Ron showed up next to you.<br></p><p>\u201cWell, isn\u2019t it our younger brother,\u201d Fred joked, roughly slapping Ron on the back. He groaned, annoyed.<br></p><p>\u201cCan we go,\u201d Ron said, turning to you. You huffed and nodded.<br></p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d you pouted and linked arms with Ron. George eyed you both up and down, noticing how comfortable Ron was acting with you. He elbowed Fred in the ribs slightly and gestured to the two of you slightly. Fred also looked at you two and squinted his eyes. Usually, Ron was always shy around you and wouldn\u2019t dare get too close enough to touch you, let alone link arms.<br></p><p>\u201cSee you, Fred and George,\u201d you smiled as Ron pulled you away.<br></p><p>\u201cMhmm\u2026,\u201d they said in unison, watching the two of you leave the store.<br></p><hr><p>Ron pulled you around the corner of the building as Harry and Hermione were still inside.\u00a0\u201cThey tried to charge me full price for a small orb, can you believe it? I\u201dm their brother,\u201d he complained.</p><p>You gave a little smirk.\u00a0\u201cWell, to be fair, they are trying to make business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it was one teeny little orb. They\u2019re bonkers to think I\u2019m paying $45 for it.\u201d You gave a little laugh and wrapped your arms around his neck, leaning into his touch as he grabbed your waist. You pressed your lips to his as he deepened the kiss.<br></p><p>\u201cBLOODY HELL!\u201d<br></p><p>You and Ron immediately pulled away as you\u00a0 both turned towards the loud outburst. You blushed, scratching the side of your head as you looked into your brother\u2019s shocked eyes. Next to him stood Fred and George, grinning.</p><p>\u201cGood luck with that one, little brother and little Potter,\u201d they joked and walked back inside, winking.<br></p><p>\u201cDoes anyone care to explain what\u2019s going on?!\u201d Harry exclaimed. Ron, was at a loss of words. What was he going to tell his best friend? You decided to speak up.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what it looks like,\u201d you began.<br></p><p>\u201cOh really, so my best friend and little sister were not just snogging a couple seconds ago?\u201d he retorted. You cringed at his tone of voice.<br></p><p>\u201cOkay- it\u2019s exactly what it looks like, BUT-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBack to Hogwarts in the Gryffindor common room. Now,\u201d Harry demanded and walked away.<br></p><p>You sighed and looked up at Ron. He looked back down at you with a worried expression.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who wanted to come here,\u201d he mumbled. You gasped.<br></p><p>\u201cExcuse me, you\u2019re the one who pulled me outside to snog-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d Harry snapped. You both hung your head, and trailed behind. Hermione came skipping out the store, completely oblivious to what happened seconds ago.<br></p><hr><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d Harry spoke, sitting across from the both of you in the Gryffindor common room. He didn\u2019t break eye contact once, with the either of you.<br></p><p>\u201cJust a couple months,\u201d Ron spoke.<br></p><p>\u201cHow. Long?\u201d he asked again.<br></p><p>\u201cFour months,\u201d you finished, playing with your thumbs. Harry took a deep breath, leaning into the both of his hands. He then rubbed his hands down his face and looked at you in dead silence. All the three of you could do was awkwardly stare.<br></p><p>\u201cOkay. We are going to talk about where babies come from. Do you know anything about intercourse?\u201d Harry began. Ron groaned, completely embarrassed.<br></p><p>\u201cOh for goodness sakes, Harry! I\u2019ve been getting my bloody period for six years!\u201d you exclaimed, hiding your face in your hands, mortified that he even brought up this type of discussion.<br></p><p>\u201cYes, I very well know this, but you guys must understand that you are going to get\u2026 erm.. sexual impulses and want to act upon them. And it\u2019s completely natural! But I am going to say this as your brother, Y/N, and your best friend, Ron, ignore them!\u201d he snapped. You groaned in embarrassment as Ron could do nothing but fiddle with his thumbs.<br></p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not just talking about intercourse. Ron, I know you are going to try and do vile things to my little sister. <i>Just vile!</i> But I\u2019m telling you this right now, you must also control these impulses towards other sexual acts. This goes for you too Y/N. Things such as masterbating, blowjo-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHARRY!\u201d you shouted,\u00a0\u201cBLOODY STOP!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You couldn\u2019t take anymore. This had to stop. You looked at Ron and he couldn\u2019t have looked more awkward. His face was as red as a tomato, and if it had gotten anymore red, you were sure he was going to explode.<br></p><p>\u201cMake it stop,\u201d you moaned.\u00a0\u201cI am going to leave if you continue.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNext time, I expect you to inform me of something like this happening and this all could have been avoided,\u201d Harry shrugged, putting his hands up in defense.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, we get it. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ll never hide anything from you again\u201d you mumbled, rolling your eyes.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both still my family, and if there was anyone that I\u2019d want you dating, I\u2019m glad it\u2019s someone that I can safely call my best friend,\u201d He grinned, getting up to give both you and Ron a tight hug. You both hugged back, happy that he wasn\u2019t mad.<br></p><p>\u201cBut if I ever find out that you\u2019ve hurt my sister, consider yourself dead Ronald Weasley. Understood?\u201d Harry said, giving Ron a dead stare. Ron nodded vigorously.<br></p><p>\u201cUnderstood, Harry,\u201d he said. You rolled your eyes and linked your hand with Ron\u2019s.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlright enough of this, I\u2019m over it. Let\u2019s go,\u201d you said pulling Ron with you, heading to leave the room and go anywhere Harry wasn\u2019t.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019M SERIOUS ABOUT THE BIRDS AND THE BEES!\u201d Harry called after you two.<br></p><p>\u201cBLOODY HELL, HARRY!\u201d you yelled back, and hurried away with Ron.<br></p></p>",

Even though you were a year younger than Harry, you grew accustom to always having the two around and naturally formed a bond with them. However as time passed, you grew<i> really accustom</i> to the ginger haired boy who we all call Ron Weasley. Something about him made you feel drawn to his persona and the feeling was mutual.&nbsp;</p><p>However, there was one slight problem.</p><p><i>Harry</i>.</p><p>Harry was your best friend, but so is Ron. You didn&rsquo;t know how your older brother would feel that his little sister is dating his best friend. Especially with his overprotectiveness. You know he means well, but you don&rsquo;t have any other choice but to hide it. It was for the best. Both for you <i>and </i>him.</p><p>You remember the very day that Ron asked you to be his girlfriend like it was yesterday:</p><p><i>It was Christmas time and Harry and Hermione had left to bring back butter beer for everyone. You had on your ugly sweater and sat in front of the fire warming your hands as the cold snowy weather fell from outside. You closed your eyes in bliss, as you were very very cold. You heard Ron chuckle from behind you, and you whipped your head around, giving him a playful glare.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What are you laughing at, Carrot-top?&rdquo; you teased. He smiled and began to fidget with his thumbs.<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh nothing, just admiring you being dramatic about the weather as always,&rdquo; he retorted. You gasped, and threw your hand to your chest.<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Dramatic! I am anemic and possibly get hypothermia!&rdquo; you joked. He rolled his eyes.<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Exactly my point, Drama Queen,&rdquo; he smirked. You huffed and returned back to the fire, muttering a&nbsp;&lsquo;whatever.&rsquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>Ron made his way over to you and sat down, in front of the fire.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Come to gloat some more?&rdquo; you sighed and rested your head on his shoulders. A blush rose to his pale cheeks.<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;N-No, uhm actually, I wanted to ask you something, Y/N,&rdquo; he nervously spoke. You raised your head and looked at him, tilting your head slightly, raising your eyebrow.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; You asked softly. You noticed Ron nervously nibbling on the inside of his lip as he took a shaky breath. Furrowing your eyebrows, you put your hand on top of his, to calm him down. &ldquo;Is everything all right?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Well.. I don&rsquo;t know how this is going to go and if I am pressuring you or making you feel uncomfortable in any way, do let me know and I will stop,&rdquo; he spoke, only making you more confused by the second, but you nodded, &ldquo;Here goes nothing. Y/N you&rsquo;re beautiful. Gorgeous, a Goddess, absolutely stunning, bloody brilliant! Your laugh is like music to my ears and every time you smile you make the whole room light up. I swear to it, my heart skips a beat whenever I am in your presence. Just brilliant. You&rsquo;re so caring and generous in almost every instance.. and I just don&rsquo;t understand how you do it, but you do. I&rsquo;m so blessed to have met you, even if it is through Harry, because you are truly a blessing in my life. Your personality is beyond extravagant. It&rsquo;s just&hellip; so&hellip; unique. It&rsquo;s brilliant. Bloody brilliant, really. You are brilliant. But, what I&rsquo;m trying to say is, would you like to be my girlfriend?&rdquo; He gushed.</i></p><p><i>You stared at the red-headed boy for a minute. His face was almost as red as his hair.
