Mostly, they are Ygritte bringing lunch to Jon&rsquo;s work and the two of them talking until the hour is up. When one of Jon&rsquo;s coworkers (Oh it is def Edd) calls Ygritte Jon&rsquo;s girlfriend, neither of them correct him and that&rsquo;s how they become #official.&nbsp;<br /></li><li>Their first kiss is very underwhelming. Neither of them were even thinking. They were just parting ways and they kiss and start to leave before they both realized that it was infact their first kiss. They turn, fistbump each other and leave grinning.&nbsp;<br /></li><li>Jon never asks for Ygritte to move in. She just slowly starts leaving things there behind until one morning she is in her own apartment, cannot find her hairbrush- realizes it is at Jon&rsquo;s and then realizes that her apartment is basically empty and most of her things are at Jon&rsquo;s. She packs up the rest of her apartment in two boxes and brings them to Jon&rsquo;s. While she brushes her hair, Jon empties the two boxes and puts her things away in <i>their </i>apartment.&nbsp;<br /></li></ul></p>",

Rhaegar,\n I thought&hellip; the smoke was from the fire that devoured Summerhall on\n the day of his birth, the salt from the tears shed for those who died. \nHe shared my belief when he was young, but later he became persuaded \nthat it was his own son who fulfilled the prophecy, for a comet had been\n seen above King&rsquo;s Landing on the night Aegon was conceived, and Rhaegar was certain the bleeding star had to be a comet.&rdquo; <br /></small></p><p><small>&ndash;Maester Aemon, AFFC, Samwell IV</small></p></blockquote><p>Rhaegar was corresponding with Maester Aemon on the matter of the Prince that was Promised. He was doing so about his son Aegon by Elia, who was conceived under a comet. Not about Jon, who was born a month or two after Rhaegar died, and therefore corresponding with Aemon on the matter was not possible.<br /></p><blockquote><p>\nIt really makes no sense. Again - Martell - sun, Targaryen - dragon/fire =\n two things that signify warmth, fire, nothing that signifies Ice. \n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>Rhaegar once believed that he himself was the Prince that was Promised &ndash; where&rsquo;s <i>his</i> ice, hmm? Furthermore, Aemon goes on to say he believes Dany is the actual Prince that was Promised. Like Rhaegar, Dany is wholly Targaryen, with no Stark ancestry at all, so Aemon &ndash; a person highly educated and expert on this prophecy &ndash; also believes ice is not required for the prince&rsquo;s parentage. The prince is not ice and fire, the prince&rsquo;s <i>song</i> is the song of ice and fire. <br /></p><p>Though it may be that Rhaegar believed a Stark would be helpful to make the third head of the dragon. It may be he believed he needed Lyanna&rsquo;s ice to add to his own fire, it may be he was inspired by the historical &ldquo;Pact of Ice and Fire&rdquo;, the Targ/Stark betrothal that was never fulfilled. But it was to make the &ldquo;one more&rdquo;, because &ldquo;the dragon has three heads&rdquo;, and at the time shown in the vision Rhaegar believed the prince was Aegon, the son that had been born to Elia.</p><blockquote><p>\nCouldn&rsquo;t Martin have said it to&hellip;throw people off? If it was 98, it was \nthe early days of the fandom. He couldn&rsquo;t give the secret of one of his \nkey characters away just like that. \n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>He didn&rsquo;t, GRRM doesn&rsquo;t lie in his answers to people. If he thinks an answer would be a spoiler, he just refuses to answer. See <a href=\"http://nobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com/post/163328710663/re-debunking-theories-is-it-possible-grrm\">this post</a> for more. And GRRM has said such things as Targaryens are not immune to fire, that Dany birthing the dragons was a miracle unlikely to happen again, all kinds of &ldquo;secret&rdquo; things. But <i>this</i> secret is still secret&ndash; we don&rsquo;t know <i>what</i> the song of ice and fire is, nor <i>why</i> it is the song of the Prince that was Promised, nor <i>how</i> it&rsquo;s connected with the similar-but-slightly-different prophecy of Azor Ahai Reborn, nor <i>who</i> are the three heads of the dragon, all kinds of details that have not been revealed yet. There&rsquo;s been no mention of &ldquo;the song of ice and fire&rdquo; since Dany&rsquo;s vision in the House of the Undying, and when people ask about that, about the Prince, that&rsquo;s what GRRM doesn&rsquo;t answer. But confirming that Dany identified the people in the vision correctly? That he&rsquo;ll do.</p><blockquote><p>\nI know people don&rsquo;t like the idea of Aegon being Jon&rsquo;s real name&hellip;but \nseriously, if it were Aemon or something else, why would D&amp;D change \nit? It&rsquo;s a major detail. GRRM wouldn&rsquo;t really allow them to make a \nchange that drastic, would they? <br /></p></blockquote><p>Please see <a href=\"http://nobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com/post/178376910478/things-i-think-and-junk-reblogged-your-post\">this post</a>, but also, GRRM has no control over the tv series. They paid him quite a lot of money to get that control. He&rsquo;s said he can advise them, and has, and does, and that&rsquo;s what his producer&rsquo;s credit&rsquo;s for, but they are entirely within their rights to reject that advice. <br /></p><p><i>If</i> Aegon is Jon&rsquo;s real name &ndash; which would be kinda stupid, but not impossible &ndash; it will be because Lyanna named him that because Rhaegar had convinced her of the prophecies, to be new Aegon/PTWP after the first was murdered. Not that because Rhaegar named him, or spoke about the song, since Elia&rsquo;s son Aegon was alive when he died, and Jon was not born until after he died. Because Lyanna believed that her son couldn&rsquo;t be the third head of the dragon, with the other two murdered, but he could be the Prince, whose song is the song of ice and fire.<br /></p><p>Nevertheless, in that glimpse into the past that Dany saw in the House of the Undying, Rhaegar was talking to Elia about their son Aegon.<br /></p>",
