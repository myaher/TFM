        "answer": "<p><i>tskk, okay so here we go</i></p><p>With you, Harry loved talking. He loved telling you about his day, loved hearing all about yours; gasping and offering sound effects that just add up to the story. </p><p>Another thing he loved is praise. He loved having your attention and it\u2019s not like it was hard to do that when you were married to the lad.</p><p>The list of the things that Harry hated wasn\u2019t a long one, being one that believed in the power of the word \u201chate\u201d but man did he hate your boss.</p><p>The fact that you told him, 2 months ago, that your boss has been weird with you and overly nice also ticked him off more. So when you take Harry as your plus one to a business dinner and he finds out that your boss had him sit opposite to you not next to you, it\u2019s safe to say he was ready to cut someone off.</p><p>Your boss sat beside you, talking your ear off as if you came with him and not your husband and Harry was sure that whatever you were talking about wasn\u2019t business related. </p><p>\u201cHere, try this,\u201d Your boss spoke, holding out his fork with a piece of chicken to it in front of your mouth, \u201cSo good.\u201d </p><p>By then, Harry\u2019s hands were clasped together under his chin as he watched, eyes set solely on your boss. </p><p>You smiled uncomfortably, pulling back a little, \u201cThanks, I\u2019m full.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, just one bite.\u201d Your boss almost cooed, seemingly oblivious to your left hand that you raised up, the back of your wedding ring in his face as you rejected.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very full and besides, I think I had a similar one.\u201d You tried to gently reject him.</p><p>Harry was seeing red (and green), food left untouched. </p><p>\u201cJust o-\u201c</p><p>\u201cShe said she doesn\u2019t want a fucking bite!\u201d It was rare for Harry to snap and when he did - it was bad.</p><p>The chatter stopped. Everyone on the table turning to look with eager and curious eyes. </p><p>Your boss turned to look at Harry, his smile faltering as he gave him a dirty look while you put your face in your hands, mentally groaning. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d </p><p>Harry rolled his eyes, leaning forward in his seat, \u201cI said,\u201d He spoke slower, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want a fucking bite.\u201d</p><p>And with that, he got up with a clenched fist and jaw, giving you a look before walking away.</p><p>Quickly apologising and excusing yourself, you jogged after him and out to the parking lot. \u201cHarry,\u201d You called after him, finally taking your breath as he stopped at the car, but didn\u2019t turn to look at you nevertheless, \u201cHarry, for fuck\u2019s sake.\u201d </p><p>He didn\u2019t spare you a look and instead, got inside the car and turned it on, waiting for you to get inside as his nose flared in anger. </p><p>\u201cYou know that can get me fired, right?\u201d You asked once you buckled your seatbelt and Harry didn\u2019t waste time and was on the road in a few moments.</p><p>Again, he gave you no answer. </p><p>\u201cAre you seriously giving me the silent treatment?\u201d Your eyes widened, receiving the confirmation through the lack of, \u201cAre you kidding?! What did I even do?\u201d</p><p>Deciding against talking to him at that moment any more, you let him be silent, crossing your arms over your chest as you looked out of the window.</p><p>Arriving home, he was the first to get out and walk up to the door, only leaving it open for you to close after. \u201cCan we just talk?\u201d </p><p>You watched as he shrugged off his blazer and resting it on his arm as he walked towards your bedroom, you following.</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d You tried another approach, walking towards him and wrapping your arms around him from behind, \u201cCan you calm down, please?\u201d</p><p>It was when he untangled your arms from around him and moving away that you frowned. \u201cFine. Suit yourself.\u201d </p><p>You moved away and towards the bathroom, beginning to wipe off your makeup - rather aggressively if you can say so - before walking back in the room, seeing Harry taking off his clothes. You reached to your back, trying to unzip yourself but it was a long zipper and you only managed to unzip a small part, letting out a groan as you tried to take the dress off. </p><p>Harry had helped you put it on, zipping you up before you left and leaving sweet kisses on your shoulders as he did so but right now, he watched you from the corner of his eyes struggle. You let out an exasperated groan, slumping down with a quiet \u201cFuck it\u201d as you accepted the fact that you were sleeping in your dress. </p><p>It was when you were beginning to move out of the room that you felt Harry\u2019s hands on your waist, stopping you before you felt his hands on your back, unzipping you. You smiled to yourself, finally feeling the dress loosen before turning to look at Harry, \u201cThank you.\u201d </p><p>He only glanced at you before turning and walking to the bathroom, closing the door behind him. It was getting on your nerves. Not only did you not know why he was giving <i>you</i> the silent treatment, but you hated it when he was angry with you to begin with. </p><p>You changed into a hoodie and shorts, your head turning as you heard then bathroom door open and saw Harry walking out, not sparing you a look. You huffed, walking towards your side of the bed and taking your pillow, now feeling Harry\u2019s eyes on you as you began to walk towards the door.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d He finally asked, eyes soft as he looked at your back. </p><p>\u201cWow, he talks!\u201d You said sarcastically, turning to look at him, \u201cI\u2019m sleeping in the guest room.

                "content": "<p><i>tskk, okay so here we go</i></p><p>With you, Harry loved talking. He loved telling you about his day, loved hearing all about yours; gasping and offering sound effects that just add up to the story. </p><p>Another thing he loved is praise. He loved having your attention and it&rsquo;s not like it was hard to do that when you were married to the lad.</p><p>The list of the things that Harry hated wasn&rsquo;t a long one, being one that believed in the power of the word &ldquo;hate&rdquo; but man did he hate your boss.</p><p>The fact that you told him, 2 months ago, that your boss has been weird with you and overly nice also ticked him off more. So when you take Harry as your plus one to a business dinner and he finds out that your boss had him sit opposite to you not next to you, it&rsquo;s safe to say he was ready to cut someone off.</p><p>Your boss sat beside you, talking your ear off as if you came with him and not your husband and Harry was sure that whatever you were talking about wasn&rsquo;t business related. </p><p>&ldquo;Here, try this,&rdquo; Your boss spoke, holding out his fork with a piece of chicken to it in front of your mouth, &ldquo;So good.&rdquo; </p><p>By then, Harry&rsquo;s hands were clasped together under his chin as he watched, eyes set solely on your boss. </p><p>You smiled uncomfortably, pulling back a little, &ldquo;Thanks, I&rsquo;m full.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, just one bite.&rdquo; Your boss almost cooed, seemingly oblivious to your left hand that you raised up, the back of your wedding ring in his face as you rejected.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very full and besides, I think I had a similar one.&rdquo; You tried to gently reject him.</p><p>Harry was seeing red (and green), food left untouched. </p><p>&ldquo;Just o-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She said she doesn&rsquo;t want a fucking bite!&rdquo; It was rare for Harry to snap and when he did - it was bad.</p><p>The chatter stopped. Everyone on the table turning to look with eager and curious eyes. </p><p>Your boss turned to look at Harry, his smile faltering as he gave him a dirty look while you put your face in your hands, mentally groaning. &ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo; </p><p>Harry rolled his eyes, leaning forward in his seat, &ldquo;I said,&rdquo; He spoke slower, &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t want a fucking bite.&rdquo;</p><p>And with that, he got up with a clenched fist and jaw, giving you a look before walking away.</p><p>Quickly apologising and excusing yourself, you jogged after him and out to the parking lot. &ldquo;Harry,&rdquo; You called after him, finally taking your breath as he stopped at the car, but didn&rsquo;t turn to look at you nevertheless, &ldquo;Harry, for fuck&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo; </p><p>He didn&rsquo;t spare you a look and instead, got inside the car and turned it on, waiting for you to get inside as his nose flared in anger. </p><p>&ldquo;You know that can get me fired, right?&rdquo; You asked once you buckled your seatbelt and Harry didn&rsquo;t waste time and was on the road in a few moments.</p><p>Again, he gave you no answer. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you seriously giving me the silent treatment?&rdquo; Your eyes widened, receiving the confirmation through the lack of, &ldquo;Are you kidding?! What did I even do?&rdquo;</p><p>Deciding against talking to him at that moment any more, you let him be silent, crossing your arms over your chest as you looked out of the window.</p><p>Arriving home, he was the first to get out and walk up to the door, only leaving it open for you to close after. &ldquo;Can we just talk?&rdquo; </p><p>You watched as he shrugged off his blazer and resting it on his arm as he walked towards your bedroom, you following.</p><p>&ldquo;Baby,&rdquo; You tried another approach, walking towards him and wrapping your arms around him from behind, &ldquo;Can you calm down, please?&rdquo;</p><p>It was when he untangled your arms from around him and moving away that you frowned. &ldquo;Fine. Suit yourself.&rdquo; </p><p>You moved away and towards the bathroom, beginning to wipe off your makeup - rather aggressively if you can say so - before walking back in the room, seeing Harry taking off his clothes. You reached to your back, trying to unzip yourself but it was a long zipper and you only managed to unzip a small part, letting out a groan as you tried to take the dress off. </p><p>Harry had helped you put it on, zipping you up before you left and leaving sweet kisses on your shoulders as he did so but right now, he watched you from the corner of his eyes struggle. You let out an exasperated groan, slumping down with a quiet &ldquo;Fuck it&rdquo; as you accepted the fact that you were sleeping in your dress. </p><p>It was when you were beginning to move out of the room that you felt Harry&rsquo;s hands on your waist, stopping you before you felt his hands on your back, unzipping you. You smiled to yourself, finally feeling the dress loosen before turning to look at Harry, &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; </p><p>He only glanced at you before turning and walking to the bathroom, closing the door behind him. It was getting on your nerves. Not only did you not know why he was giving <i>you</i> the silent treatment, but you hated it when he was angry with you to begin with. </p><p>You changed into a hoodie and shorts, your head turning as you heard then bathroom door open and saw Harry walking out, not sparing you a look. You huffed, walking towards your side of the bed and taking your pillow, now feeling Harry&rsquo;s eyes on you as you began to walk towards the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; He finally asked, eyes soft as he looked at your back. </p><p>&ldquo;Wow, he talks!&rdquo; You said sarcastically, turning to look at him, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sleeping in the guest room. I&rsquo;m not sleeping here when you don&rsquo;t even want to talk to me, let alone look at me.&rdquo; </p><p>Harry shook his head, walking towards you taking the pillow from your hands, throwing it on the bed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sleeping in our bed.&rdquo; He said gently, looking down at you, &ldquo;We vowed to always sleep together no matter what when we&rsquo;re together, unless we&rsquo;re in different countries.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We also vowed to talk about whatever makes us mad, Harry,&rdquo; You replied, &ldquo;We vowed to not go to bed angry at each other.&rdquo; </p><p>Suddenly sinking in, Harry looked at the ground, embarrassed at how he handled this. You cupped his cheeks, letting him look at you, &ldquo;Can you tell me what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; </p><p>He took a second just to look at you, trying to predict your reaction. &ldquo;I fucking hate your boss, Y/N.&rdquo; </p><p>You furrowed your eyebrows, &ldquo;My boss?&rdquo; </p><p>He nodded, &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t respect the fact that you&rsquo;re married. I mean, he was flirting with you and I was sitting right there!&rdquo; He said in bitter humour, eyes widening, &ldquo;What kind of a dick does that?&rdquo; He asked, &ldquo;And I know that you&rsquo;re beautiful, incredibly wonderful and so easy to love and I&rsquo;m so fucking lucky to be your husband but he&rsquo;s all over you. It was like-&ldquo; He stopped, letting out a breath, &ldquo;It was like you were <i>his</i> plus one, if not girlfriend.&rdquo; </p><p>You smiled sympathetically, &ldquo;Harry&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; He nodded, dropping his head back in defeat, making you remove your hands, &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m being a petty, jealous dick right now and I sound insecure but I fucking hate him and I&rsquo;m sorry I took it out on you and embarrassed you in front of your colleagues.&rdquo; As he spoke, Harry cringed at the end, thinking about the scene he caused.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you done?&rdquo; You chuckled softly, looking up at him.</p><p>At the sound of your chuckles, he looked back at you, almost calming once he saw the small smile on your face.
