Probably more than that, actually. Thousands and <i>thousands</i>\u00a0of them. And he isn\u2019t opposed to poetry! Poetry is fine. Sometimes, it\u2019s even good. He and the angel tend to differ on what <i>exactly</i>\u00a0is good, but that\u2019s fine, that\u2019s just fine.</p><p>And tonight&ndash;</p><p style=\"\">Well.</p><p style=\"\">Tonight is different.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s a year after the almost-apocalypse. It\u2019s a year and a half since they last went to a poetry reading. And right now? Aziraphale is <i>squirming</i>\u00a0in his seat, and Crowley is fascinated.\u00a0</p><p>His chin is rested against his palm, his fingers against his lips, and he watches Aziraphale, whose gaze is fixated on the young man on the stage, who is reading from, of all people, <i>Ginsberg</i>. He and Aziraphale have fought about Ginsberg for a little under forty years: ordinarily, Aziraphale (and Crowley, too, although he\u2019d be much more ready to admit to it) has a habit of taking outsiders into his heart, and always has a deep affection for poets&hellip; He\u2019d <i>sobbed</i>\u00a0over Oscar Wilde, after the trial and after he\u2019d died, but Ginsberg has never appealed to him.</p><p><i>He\u2019s obscene, Crowley.</i></p><p><i>Yes, angel, that\u2019s what the trial\u2019s for.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Oh, the trial! Ridiculous! He oughtn\u2019t be <b>on trial</b>, obviously, but I just say from a place of personal preference that I really&ndash; No, I just don\u2019t see all that focus on&hellip;</i></p><!-- more --><p style=\"\"><i>Sex?</i></p><p style=\"\"><i>Yes! Sex! It\u2019s excessive!</i></p><p style=\"\">But now&hellip;?</p><p>Aziraphale\u2019s cheeks are burning with red heat, his eyes wide, and he has one of his plump, lovely palms pressed tight against his mouth, his finger and thumb gripping tightly enough at his own jaw that Crowley can see the flesh dimple.\u00a0</p><p>His legs are crossed. <i>Tightly</i>.</p><p>Crowley grins.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAngel,\u201d he says, when the lad finishes, and Aziraphale turns to look at him, his eyes widening a little more.<br/></p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d he asks, like he\u2019s frightened to actually open his mouth to talk.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Crowley stands, and he gestures for Aziraphale to follow him, which he hesitates before so doing: their fingers interlink as Crowley leads Aziraphale by his hand out of the bar. It makes <i>sense</i>, of course, that some poetry is in a slightly different perspective now. He and Aziraphale have embarked on a <i>few</i>\u00a0new journeys in the past year, and sex is part of it, sex is a <i>big</i>\u00a0part of it&ndash;</p><p>\u201cOh, dear boy, what are we <i>doing</i>?\u201d Aziraphale asks as Crowley drags him into the little supplies cupboard, and Crowley pulls him up into a hard kiss, and Aziraphale gasps into his mouth, shuddering and leaning up against Crowley\u2019s body. He is all but <i>trembling</i>, and Crowley grabs at his arse through the grey fabric of his trousers, and Aziraphale lets out a heady noise against Crowley\u2019s mouth.<br/></p><p style=\"\">\u201cBend over,\u201d Crowley says.<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Crowley, </i>we can\u2019t, what if someone&ndash;\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou just got hot and bothered at a <i>poetry</i>\u00a0reading, angel: <i>bend over</i>.\u201d</p><p>Crowley doesn\u2019t wait for him to argue: he manhandles Aziraphale and shoves him up against one of the shelves, ignoring the clink of bottles against one another, and Aziraphale heaves in a gasp, but he doesn\u2019t complain.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou get it now, huh, angel?\u201d Crowley hisses in his ear, and he bites at the back of his neck, feeling Aziraphale\u2019s legs spread apart before his knees even as he <i>whimpers</i>.\u00a0\u201cI remember, I read you <i>Please Master</i>, and you just stared at me the whole time, all blank-faced and <i>snooty</i>, and now&ndash;\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOh, no, no, Crowley, you mustn\u2019t&ndash;\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Please master can I touch your cheek / Please master can I kneel at your feet</i>&ndash;\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOh, <i>Crowley</i>, I\u2019m too weak for poetry right now, I, <i>oh</i>&ndash;\u201d<br/></p><p>Crowley laughs against the back of his neck, his tongue flickering out and catching at his earlobe, and Aziraphale heaves in a noise as Crowley gets his hand down the back of his trousers, dipping between his arsecheeks and delighting in the <i>wail</i>\u00a0Aziraphale lets out.\u00a0</p><p style=\"\">\u201cSomeone\u2019s going to hear us, Crowley&ndash;\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOh, no, no, darling,\u201d Crowley purrs,\u00a0\u201cthey\u2019ll only hear <i>you</i>.\u201d Aziraphale moans as Crowley twists his wrist, his thighs falling open as he leans heavily on the shelves.\u00a0\u201c<i>Please master can I loosen your blue pants&ndash;\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cOh, Crowley, don\u2019t tease me,\u201d Aziraphale begs, and Crowley drags hard at his trousers, pulling them down along with Aziraphale\u2019s <i>stupid</i>, old-fashioned breeches, and then he drops to his knees.\u00a0</p><p>Aziraphale is lucky Crowley thought to soundproof the little room <i>as</i>\u00a0he\u2019d entered, because with <i>this\u00a0</i>noise, he certainly would have forgotten if he\u2019d left it in any later.\u00a0</p>",
