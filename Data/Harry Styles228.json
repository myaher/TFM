Though the guards tried to stop him from disturbing the King, he was in no way affected by their warnings.</i></p><p><i>\u201cStop me and I\u2019d have you all\u00a0beheaded,\u201d he growled and the men in armors immediately backed away.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Knowing the Prince their whole lives, all the servants of the royal court had no doubt\u00a0that he would always put his words into actions. So of course, for fear of losing their heads,\u00a0these men had to let him through.<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cFather, may I speak with you?\u201d The Prince spoke when he barged into the room all of a sudden. Still his entrance didn\u2019t steal the King\u2019s attention away from the open book in front of him.</i></p><p><i>\u201cEdward, did I just hear you threaten to have my guards\u2019 heads?\u201d The old monarch shifted a bit in his chair, making the young man flinch in anxiety.</i></p><p><i>The King was the only person in the world who could have the Prince shaking in his boots, which was why Edward had never failed to follow his father\u2019s every wish since the day he was born. This time, however, would be an exception.<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cFather, I was informed about the Princess\u2019 visit.\u201d<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cGood.\u201d The King lifted his face and gave his son a firm stare.\u00a0\u201cYou should be getting ready, she\u2019d be here soon.\u201d<br/></i></p><p><i></i></p><p><i>\u201cWith all due respect, father, I am not going to marry a girl I do not know.\u201d<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cShe\u2019s the Princess of France.\u201d<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t care who she is. I do not love her.\u201d Edward could not believe he dared to say that himself, still he stood tall with no sign of weakness, exactly like his father had taught him. </i></p><p><i>But instead of showing his concern, the King appeared a bit too calm in reaction to his son\u2019s objection to the marriage arrangement. <br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cSpending too much time with your mother, I see.\u201d He shook his head side to side slowly. \u201cEdward, royalties do not marry for love, we marry for duty. And your duty to the kingdom is having that French girl as your wife, for the French are one of our strongest allies.\u201d<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cSo you do not love my mother?\u201d<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cI love the Queen, because I am married to her, not the other way around,\u201d the King asserted as he closed the book in front of him and intertwined his fingers on the table, not a single smile displayed upon his thin lips. </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou are going to marry this Princess, then you will learn to love her.\u201d</i></p><p>&hellip;</p><p>For the past fifteen minutes, Harry had been pacing back and forth in the studio with his phone clutched in his hand. His girlfriend hadn\u2019t replied to his latest text or called him back and he knew all too well that meant nothing but trouble. It wasn\u2019t the first time they fought though. In fact, they hadn\u2019t gone through one month in their two years together without at least one big argument. It always began with her getting mad at something he did or said, and ended with him begging on his knees for her to stay.</p><p>Jeff had been\u00a0watching Harry from the couch for a while now, and even though it wasn\u2019t\u00a0him who\u2019s in hot water, he still got pretty frustrated.</p><p>\u201cHarold, could you please just sit down?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cLillie, she-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cEnough with Lillie!\u00a0You have more important things to take care of over here.\u201d Jeff exhales, patting on the pile of folders in front of him to get Harry\u2019s attention.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat are those?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cJob applications.\u201d<br/></p><p>Harry breathed out a laugh, then realized Jeff wasn\u2019t joking.\u00a0\u201cI already told you I didn\u2019t need a personal assistant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Harry, you sure as hell need one. You\u2019re going to be so busy once your second tour starts.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThe last assistant sold my private info to the press. I don\u2019t trust anyone else, I\u2019ve got you.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI cannot help you with everything, Haz! I\u2019ve read and picked out these excellent applications, your job is just to decide which one.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay then.\u201d Harry bent down and pulled out a random folder in the pile, then handed it to his manager.\u00a0\u201cThis one.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBut you haven\u2019t even read what\u2019s inside!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have, and I trust you.\u201d Harry grinned, just in time his phone notified him of a new text from his girlfriend, and he wasted no time to make his way to the exit.\u00a0\u201cCould you please take care of the rest? I will be right back!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cHarry!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI promise!\u201d shouted Harry from the door as the sound of his footsteps faded away in the hallway.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p><i>\u201cWith me in the studio right now is the lovely and talented singer/songwriter Lillie Xander!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThank you for having me!\u201d<br/></i></p><p><i></i><i>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome darling!\u00a0So Lillie, your first single Him has reached number one in the UK, I mean, the song itself is a bop, but the fans cannot stop talking about the lyrics. They all want to know if this song is about your boyfriend Harry Styles.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI think the lyrics are fairly self-explanatory. I\u2019m in a happy relationship and I think it\u2019s common for artists to write from personal experiences. I hope that answers your question.\u201d<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cIt certainly does, thanks love. Now, let\u2019s listen to\u00a0Him from Lillie\u2019s new album \u2018French Rose\u2019\u00a0coming out this October!\u201d</i><br/></p><p>\u201cHey! Give me back my phone!\u201d</p><p>Y/N ignored her friend\u2019s reaction as she turned the iPhone\u2019s volume down, then handed the device back to the girl.</p><p>\u201cDid you have to\u00a0listen to your radio show that loud, Lisa?\u201d Y/N snorted, receiving a disapproving glare from her friend.<br/></p><p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s Lillie fucking Xander!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m trying to concentrate!\u201d said Y/N as she marched out of the kitchen, back to the couch where she\u2019d left her unfinished sketch.\u00a0Lisa pulled herself a chair by the dining table and paused her radio show to check on her friend.<br/></p><p>\u201cWeird, I haven\u2019t seen you draw again in months, getting all inspired by that museum date?\u201d<br/></p><p>Y/N paused the movements of her pencil on the paper and looked up, receiving a playful grin from Lisa.</p><p>\u201cOkay, first of all, it wasn\u2019t a date,\u201d she clarified, squinting her eyes as she put the pencil down.\u00a0\u201cSecond of all, don\u2019t even mention Jason, okay?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cCome on, how long are you gonna stay mad at him?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cHe tried to kiss me, Lisa! He\u2019s been my best friend since first grade now I can\u2019t even look at him!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAt least talk it out like adults, you can\u2019t ignore him forever.\u201d<br/></p><p>Just as Lisa finished her sentence, Y/N\u2019s phone on the dining table started ringing, announcing her of an incoming call.

Though the guards tried to stop him from disturbing the King, he was in no way affected by their warnings.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Stop me and I&rsquo;d have you all&nbsp;beheaded,&rdquo; he growled and the men in armors immediately backed away.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Knowing the Prince their whole lives, all the servants of the royal court had no doubt&nbsp;that he would always put his words into actions. So of course, for fear of losing their heads,&nbsp;these men had to let him through.<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Father, may I speak with you?&rdquo; The Prince spoke when he barged into the room all of a sudden. Still his entrance didn&rsquo;t steal the King&rsquo;s attention away from the open book in front of him.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Edward, did I just hear you threaten to have my guards&rsquo; heads?&rdquo; The old monarch shifted a bit in his chair, making the young man flinch in anxiety.</i></p><p><i>The King was the only person in the world who could have the Prince shaking in his boots, which was why Edward had never failed to follow his father&rsquo;s every wish since the day he was born. This time, however, would be an exception.<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Father, I was informed about the Princess&rsquo; visit.&rdquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; The King lifted his face and gave his son a firm stare.&nbsp;&ldquo;You should be getting ready, she&rsquo;d be here soon.&rdquo;<br /></i></p><p><i></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;With all due respect, father, I am not going to marry a girl I do not know.&rdquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the Princess of France.&rdquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care who she is. I do not love her.&rdquo; Edward could not believe he dared to say that himself, still he stood tall with no sign of weakness, exactly like his father had taught him. </i></p><p><i>But instead of showing his concern, the King appeared a bit too calm in reaction to his son&rsquo;s objection to the marriage arrangement. <br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Spending too much time with your mother, I see.&rdquo; He shook his head side to side slowly. &ldquo;Edward, royalties do not marry for love, we marry for duty. And your duty to the kingdom is having that French girl as your wife, for the French are one of our strongest allies.&rdquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;So you do not love my mother?&rdquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I love the Queen, because I am married to her, not the other way around,&rdquo; the King asserted as he closed the book in front of him and intertwined his fingers on the table, not a single smile displayed upon his thin lips. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You are going to marry this Princess, then you will learn to love her.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&hellip;</p><p>For the past fifteen minutes, Harry had been pacing back and forth in the studio with his phone clutched in his hand. His girlfriend hadn&rsquo;t replied to his latest text or called him back and he knew all too well that meant nothing but trouble. It wasn&rsquo;t the first time they fought though. In fact, they hadn&rsquo;t gone through one month in their two years together without at least one big argument. It always began with her getting mad at something he did or said, and ended with him begging on his knees for her to stay.</p><p>Jeff had been&nbsp;watching Harry from the couch for a while now, and even though it wasn&rsquo;t&nbsp;him who&rsquo;s in hot water, he still got pretty frustrated.</p><p>&ldquo;Harold, could you please just sit down?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Lillie, she-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Enough with Lillie!&nbsp;You have more important things to take care of over here.&rdquo; Jeff exhales, patting on the pile of folders in front of him to get Harry&rsquo;s attention.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What are those?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Job applications.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Harry breathed out a laugh, then realized Jeff wasn&rsquo;t joking.&nbsp;&ldquo;I already told you I didn&rsquo;t need a personal assistant.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Harry, you sure as hell need one. You&rsquo;re going to be so busy once your second tour starts.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;The last assistant sold my private info to the press. I don&rsquo;t trust anyone else, I&rsquo;ve got you.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I cannot help you with everything, Haz! I&rsquo;ve read and picked out these excellent applications, your job is just to decide which one.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay then.&rdquo; Harry bent down and pulled out a random folder in the pile, then handed it to his manager.&nbsp;&ldquo;This one.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t even read what&rsquo;s inside!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you have, and I trust you.&rdquo; Harry grinned, just in time his phone notified him of a new text from his girlfriend, and he wasted no time to make his way to the exit.&nbsp;&ldquo;Could you please take care of the rest? I will be right back!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Harry!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I promise!&rdquo; shouted Harry from the door as the sound of his footsteps faded away in the hallway.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p><i>&ldquo;With me in the studio right now is the lovely and talented singer/songwriter Lillie Xander!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Thank you for having me!&rdquo;<br /></i></p><p><i></i><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome darling!&nbsp;So Lillie, your first single Him has reached number one in the UK, I mean, the song itself is a bop, but the fans cannot stop talking about the lyrics. They all want to know if this song is about your boyfriend Harry Styles.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I think the lyrics are fairly self-explanatory. I&rsquo;m in a happy relationship and I think it&rsquo;s common for artists to write from personal experiences. I hope that answers your question.&rdquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It certainly does, thanks love.

But now, she was standing in a bus, waiting for the stop she gets off of so she could go home. Y/N was leaning against the metal pole, holding onto it tightly due to the bus\u2019 sudden jerks and speedy movements; she had her bag under her arm pressing it against her body, as every one always warned her that someone might always try and steal it. </p><p>Sometimes, standing in a bus made Y/N realise how much she wanted to have money to buy herself a car so she would never have to take the public transport again. But being a full-time student and only a part-time worker, the pay wasn\u2019t exactly high enough to provide money for a car as well, so she had to make it work and accept the public transport as it was. </p><p>As a person, Y/N was a very gentle and caring soul. Even though when she would have the worst day, she still managed to fight a smile through; even when she was feeling tired and she didn\u2019t feel like standing, she would give her seat up for someone else. Even when she was running late or really busy, Y/N would still make time to help an elderly person cross the street or help them with their bags; it was just how she was raised - to help people and care about them. So it wasn\u2019t the biggest surprise to her family and friends when Y/N told them she wanted to study defectology and psychology both at the same time; it wasn\u2019t a surprise because that was all Y/N ever wanted.</p><!-- more --><p>When a tall boy stumbled into the bus, angrily pushing his way through the mass, Y/N didn\u2019t pay too much attention to it. But when he stood right next to her, gripping the metal pole so tight that his knuckles were turning white and clutching his other fist open and then close, she did start to worry a little bit. </p><p>The boy had a steady and strong posture with a firm look on his face, his eyebrows were furrowed together and his jawline kept clenching hard. The grip on the pole tightening and loosening with every second, while he kept pressing his nails into his other palm. The look in his eyes was stern and angry, almost like fury was burning through them. </p><p>\u2018\u2018Hiii, please, um, calm down. I-I know it\u2019s the worst thing to say to someone, but please relax your hands, you-you\u2019re gonna hurt yourself.\u2019\u2018 Y/N softly said, making sure not to scare the boy next to her as she spoke. Her voice was small but very gently, not having intentions to upset the boy even more. </p><p>\u2018\u2018Mind your own fucking business, little girl.\u2019\u2018 He turned his head into the girls direction the second he heard he speak. His voice was laced with anger and he sent her a mean glare. </p><p>\u2018\u2018I-I understand that you\u2019re angry, but ju-just please stop gripping so tightly, you really are gonna hurt your knuckles.\u2019\u2018 Y/N gently placed her small hand over his, feeling it tense up a little bit but he loosened the grip. \u2018\u2019I know it\u2019s none of my business, but you should be this angry, it\u2019s not good for you.\u2019\u2019 She added, moving closer to stand right in front of him. </p><p>\u2018\u2018Oh yes, because finding out my girlfriend had been cheating on me for the past five months is <i>oh so fucking joyful</i>.\u2019\u2019 He snapped at her, jerking his hand away from her. \u2018\u2018Just get the fuck away from me. Stop being a mare and go on with your bloomy life, yeah?\u2019\u2018 It was like he was directing all his anger at Y/N, for no reason, but she was simply there and he needed to get his anger out. </p><p>\u2018\u2018Okay.\u2019\u2018 Y/N whispered, nodding her head slowly. \u2018\u2018My life is anything but bloomy, but I get it, I am sorry for approaching you. It wasn\u2019t my intention to play someone kind of hero or upset you even more, but I apologise.\u2019\u2018 She added, looking briefly into his green eyes, watching them switch between two emotions but she couldn\u2019t figure out which ones. \u2018\u2018Hope you have a lovely day.\u2019\u2018 </p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t have to apologise to him, she didn\u2019t do anything wrong but she simply accepted the fact that not everyone was going to accept her help and see it as something good, rather than <i>being a mare</i>. She moved away from him, leaning against the window and just looking at the buildings that were passing by. It hurt her feelings how everyone thought she was a happy ball of sunshine just by judging the smile on her face, and it made her sad how the boy snapped at her but she sucked it up and moved on. That\u2019s what everyone always told her to do. </p><p>There was three more stops before Y/N was supposed to get off, but she decided just to walk as she wanted to feel the fresh air and just relax while walking. So on the next stop, Y/N started leave, muttering <i>sorry\u2019s</i> and <i>excuse me\u2019s</i> as she pushed herself through the crowded bus towards the door. Y/N even said <i>sorry</i> to the angry boy she accidentally pushed since he was now standing right next to the entrance. Getting out, she picked her pace and started walking towards her home when she heard someone calling after her.</p><p>\u2018\u2018Wait!\u2019\u2018 She heard a voice behind her, \u2018\u2018Bloody \u2018ell, you\u2019re fast.\u2019\u2018 When she turned around she saw that the boy from the bus followed her. </p><p>\u2018\u2018I wanted to apologise, I was bei-\u2019\u2018 The boy began, but Y/N cut him off. </p><p>\u2018\u2018It\u2019s fine.\u2019\u2018 She had a tight-lipped smile on her face. </p><p>\u2018\u2018You\u2019re not even gonna let me speak, huh?\u2019\u2018 He narrowed his eyes at her in a questionable manner. </p><p>\u2018\u2018Because there is nothing to apologise for. But like I said, it\u2019s fine.\u2019\u2018 She gripped onto her bag, as she turned around to leave again. </p><p>\u2018\u2018No, wait, just wait, alright?\u2019\u2018 The boy grabbed her wrist quickly, spinning her around to face him. \u2018\u2018Just let me apologise.\u2019\u2018 Y/N only lowered her head and nodded. </p><p>\u2018\u2018It was very rude of me to snap at you like that. My mum would have been <i>very</i>disappointed with me if she knew. So I\u2019m sorry, it wasn\u2019t nice at all.\u2019\u2018 He said, but he quickly continued as the girl didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>\u2018\u2018Just because I felt heartbroken because of a girl, it doesn\u2019t mean I should have been rude to someone else, who happened to be a girl as well.\u2019\u2018 He tried to make her look at him or just look up, but she still kept her head low. His heart was beating fast because the girl was making him nervous.</p><p>\u2018\u2018Once again, s\u2019alright.\u2019\u2018 Y/N replied, simply because she didn\u2019t want to care and it was fine, she just shouldn\u2019t have bothered him. \u2018\u2018Just because of the fact that someone <i>broke you</i>, you shouldn\u2019t have the need <i>to break</i>. And it seemed like you were trying to break yourself even more, so I just wanted you to stop doing it.\u2019\u2018 She quickly added, but still avoiding his gaze. </p><p>\u2018\u2018Can you look at me?\u2019\u2018 He was standing really close now; their feet and body only inches apart. Y/N looked up, meeting his eyes; they weren\u2019t as angry as before and they seemed softer than the last time she looked into them. She didn\u2019t feel scared of him, but she couldn\u2019t lie and say she didn\u2019t feel intimidated by him. </p><p>\u2018\u2018Do you think you could forgive me?\u2019\u2019 The boy whispered softly at her, like he didn\u2019t want anyone else to know about them, but Y/N just nodded and looked back down again. </p><p>\u2018\u2018You were being nothing but nice to me,\u2019\u2018 he put his index finger under her chin \u00a0pushing it up to meet her eyes, \u2018\u2018and your voice was nothing but soft and your touch was gentle. I do appreciate the gesture and your gentleness, it did feel very\u2026 comforting. And <i>I</i> was a dick, to <i>you</i>. So I hope you can forgive me, because I feel bad for snapping at you.\u2019\u2018 He kept the eye contact through the whole conversation, desperate for her to forgive because in the pit of his stomach he felt really bad for the way he reacted. </p><p>\u2018\u2018I guess I forgive you, if that makes you feel better.\u2019\u2018 Y/N shrugged her shoulders.</p><p>\u2018\u2018Don\u2019t forgive me to make me feel better. Do it if you think you should, because I was a dick, and you do have the right to be upset with me.\u2019\u2018</p><p>\u2018\u2018You\u2019re not a dick. You were angry and I was intruding\u2026 but yeah, it\u2019s fine, really.\u2019\u2018 </p><p>\u2018\u2018Well, thank you.. You weren\u2019t intruding, and I am really sorry.\u2019\u2018 The boy gently placed his hand over her, giving it a light squeeze. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m Harry, by the way.\u2019\u2018 He added, smiling softly at her. </p><p>\u2018\u2018I am Y/N, it\u2019s nice to meet you Harry.\u2019\u2018 Y/N cocked her head to the side, giving him a smile while she could feel her cheeks become a bit warm from the gentle touch. </p><p>\u2018\u2018I really hope it is.\u2019\u2018</p><p>It was weird, because only hours ago Harry was an angry man ready to smash each and every single thing once he would have arrived home, but yet when he heard Y/N speak it was like everything stopped, like his broken heart felt reassured that it was going to be whole again. </p><p><i>It was also going to be a strange story to tell how he had met his girl and the love of his life when he was mourning the heartbreak of one Harry thought was his. </i></p>",

Stop being a mare and go on with your bloomy life, yeah?\u2019\u2018 It was like he was directing all his anger at Y/N, for no reason, but she was simply there and he needed to get his anger out. </p><p>\u2018\u2018Okay.\u2019\u2018 Y/N whispered, nodding her head slowly. \u2018\u2018My life is anything but bloomy, but I get it, I am sorry for approaching you. It wasn\u2019t my intention to play someone kind of hero or upset you even more, but I apologise.\u2019\u2018 She added, looking briefly into his green eyes, watching them switch between two emotions but she couldn\u2019t figure out which ones. \u2018\u2018Hope you have a lovely day.\u2019\u2018 </p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t have to apologise to him, she didn\u2019t do anything wrong but she simply accepted the fact that not everyone was going to accept her help and see it as something good, rather than <i>being a mare</i>. She moved away from him, leaning against the window and just looking at the buildings that were passing by. It hurt her feelings how everyone thought she was a happy ball of sunshine just by judging the smile on her face, and it made her sad how the boy snapped at her but she sucked it up and moved on. That\u2019s what everyone always told her to do. </p><p>There was three more stops before Y/N was supposed to get off, but she decided just to walk as she wanted to feel the fresh air and just relax while walking. So on the next stop, Y/N started leave, muttering <i>sorry\u2019s</i> and <i>excuse me\u2019s</i> as she pushed herself through the crowded bus towards the door. Y/N even said <i>sorry</i> to the angry boy she accidentally pushed since he was now standing right next to the entrance. Getting out, she picked her pace and started walking towards her home when she heard someone calling after her.</p><p>\u2018\u2018Wait!\u2019\u2018 She heard a voice behind her, \u2018\u2018Bloody \u2018ell, you\u2019re fast.\u2019\u2018 When she turned around she saw that the boy from the bus followed her. </p><p>\u2018\u2018I wanted to apologise, I was bei-\u2019\u2018 The boy began, but Y/N cut him off. </p><p>\u2018\u2018It\u2019s fine.\u2019\u2018 She had a tight-lipped smile on her face. </p><p>\u2018\u2018You\u2019re not even gonna let me speak, huh?\u2019\u2018 He narrowed his eyes at her in a questionable manner. </p><p>\u2018\u2018Because there is nothing to apologise for. But like I said, it\u2019s fine.\u2019\u2018 She gripped onto her bag, as she turned around to leave again. </p><p>\u2018\u2018No, wait, just wait, alright?\u2019\u2018 The boy grabbed her wrist quickly, spinning her around to face him. \u2018\u2018Just let me apologise.\u2019\u2018 Y/N only lowered her head and nodded. </p><p>\u2018\u2018It was very rude of me to snap at you like that. My mum would have been <i>very</i>disappointed with me if she knew. So I\u2019m sorry, it wasn\u2019t nice at all.\u2019\u2018 He said, but he quickly continued as the girl didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>\u2018\u2018Just because I felt heartbroken because of a girl, it doesn\u2019t mean I should have been rude to someone else, who happened to be a girl as well.\u2019\u2018 He tried to make her look at him or just look up, but she still kept her head low. His heart was beating fast because the girl was making him nervous.</p><p>\u2018\u2018Once again, s\u2019alright.\u2019\u2018 Y/N replied, simply because she didn\u2019t want to care and it was fine, she just shouldn\u2019t have bothered him. \u2018\u2018Just because of the fact that someone <i>broke you</i>, you shouldn\u2019t have the need <i>to break</i>. And it seemed like you were trying to break yourself even more, so I just wanted you to stop doing it.\u2019\u2018 She quickly added, but still avoiding his gaze. </p><p>\u2018\u2018Can you look at me?\u2019\u2018 He was standing really close now; their feet and body only inches apart. Y/N looked up, meeting his eyes; they weren\u2019t as angry as before and they seemed softer than the last time she looked into them. She didn\u2019t feel scared of him, but she couldn\u2019t lie and say she didn\u2019t feel intimidated by him. </p><p>\u2018\u2018Do you think you could forgive me?\u2019\u2019 The boy whispered softly at her, like he didn\u2019t want anyone else to know about them, but Y/N just nodded and looked back down again. </p><p>\u2018\u2018You were being nothing but nice to me,\u2019\u2018 he put his index finger under her chin \u00a0pushing it up to meet her eyes, \u2018\u2018and your voice was nothing but soft and your touch was gentle. I do appreciate the gesture and your gentleness, it did feel very\u2026 comforting. And <i>I</i> was a dick, to <i>you</i>. So I hope you can forgive me, because I feel bad for snapping at you.\u2019\u2018 He kept the eye contact through the whole conversation, desperate for her to forgive because in the pit of his stomach he felt really bad for the way he reacted. </p><p>\u2018\u2018I guess I forgive you, if that makes you feel better.\u2019\u2018 Y/N shrugged her shoulders.</p><p>\u2018\u2018Don\u2019t forgive me to make me feel better. Do it if you think you should, because I was a dick, and you do have the right to be upset with me.\u2019\u2018</p><p>\u2018\u2018You\u2019re not a dick. You were angry and I was intruding\u2026 but yeah, it\u2019s fine, really.\u2019\u2018 </p><p>\u2018\u2018Well, thank you.. You weren\u2019t intruding, and I am really sorry.\u2019\u2018 The boy gently placed his hand over her, giving it a light squeeze. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m Harry, by the way.\u2019\u2018 He added, smiling softly at her. </p><p>\u2018\u2018I am Y/N, it\u2019s nice to meet you Harry.\u2019\u2018 Y/N cocked her head to the side, giving him a smile while she could feel her cheeks become a bit warm from the gentle touch. </p><p>\u2018\u2018I really hope it is.\u2019\u2018</p><p>It was weird, because only hours ago Harry was an angry man ready to smash each and every single thing once he would have arrived home, but yet when he heard Y/N speak it was like everything stopped, like his broken heart felt reassured that it was going to be whole again. </p><p><i>It was also going to be a strange story to tell how he had met his girl and the love of his life when he was mourning the heartbreak of one Harry thought was his. </i></p></p>",

But now, she was standing in a bus, waiting for the stop she gets off of so she could go home. Y/N was leaning against the metal pole, holding onto it tightly due to the bus\u2019 sudden jerks and speedy movements; she had her bag under her arm pressing it against her body, as every one always warned her that someone might always try and steal it. </p><p>Sometimes, standing in a bus made Y/N realise how much she wanted to have money to buy herself a car so she would never have to take the public transport again. But being a full-time student and only a part-time worker, the pay wasn\u2019t exactly high enough to provide money for a car as well, so she had to make it work and accept the public transport as it was. </p><p>As a person, Y/N was a very gentle and caring soul. Even though when she would have the worst day, she still managed to fight a smile through; even when she was feeling tired and she didn\u2019t feel like standing, she would give her seat up for someone else. Even when she was running late or really busy, Y/N would still make time to help an elderly person cross the street or help them with their bags; it was just how she was raised - to help people and care about them. So it wasn\u2019t the biggest surprise to her family and friends when Y/N told them she wanted to study defectology and psychology both at the same time; it wasn\u2019t a surprise because that was all Y/N ever wanted.</p>[[MORE]]<p>When a tall boy stumbled into the bus, angrily pushing his way through the mass, Y/N didn\u2019t pay too much attention to it. But when he stood right next to her, gripping the metal pole so tight that his knuckles were turning white and clutching his other fist open and then close, she did start to worry a little bit. </p><p>The boy had a steady and strong posture with a firm look on his face, his eyebrows were furrowed together and his jawline kept clenching hard. The grip on the pole tightening and loosening with every second, while he kept pressing his nails into his other palm. The look in his eyes was stern and angry, almost like fury was burning through them. </p><p>\u2018\u2018Hiii, please, um, calm down. I-I know it\u2019s the worst thing to say to someone, but please relax your hands, you-you\u2019re gonna hurt yourself.\u2019\u2018 Y/N softly said, making sure not to scare the boy next to her as she spoke.

It wasn&rsquo;t my intention to play someone kind of hero or upset you even more, but I apologise.&rsquo;&lsquo; She added, looking briefly into his green eyes, watching them switch between two emotions but she couldn&rsquo;t figure out which ones. &lsquo;&lsquo;Hope you have a lovely day.&rsquo;&lsquo; </p><p>Y/N didn&rsquo;t have to apologise to him, she didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong but she simply accepted the fact that not everyone was going to accept her help and see it as something good, rather than <i>being a mare</i>. She moved away from him, leaning against the window and just looking at the buildings that were passing by. It hurt her feelings how everyone thought she was a happy ball of sunshine just by judging the smile on her face, and it made her sad how the boy snapped at her but she sucked it up and moved on. That&rsquo;s what everyone always told her to do. </p><p>There was three more stops before Y/N was supposed to get off, but she decided just to walk as she wanted to feel the fresh air and just relax while walking. So on the next stop, Y/N started leave, muttering <i>sorry&rsquo;s</i> and <i>excuse me&rsquo;s</i> as she pushed herself through the crowded bus towards the door. Y/N even said <i>sorry</i> to the angry boy she accidentally pushed since he was now standing right next to the entrance. Getting out, she picked her pace and started walking towards her home when she heard someone calling after her.</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Wait!&rsquo;&lsquo; She heard a voice behind her, &lsquo;&lsquo;Bloody &lsquo;ell, you&rsquo;re fast.&rsquo;&lsquo; When she turned around she saw that the boy from the bus followed her. </p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I wanted to apologise, I was bei-&rsquo;&lsquo; The boy began, but Y/N cut him off. </p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s fine.&rsquo;&lsquo; She had a tight-lipped smile on her face. </p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;re not even gonna let me speak, huh?&rsquo;&lsquo; He narrowed his eyes at her in a questionable manner. </p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Because there is nothing to apologise for. But like I said, it&rsquo;s fine.&rsquo;&lsquo; She gripped onto her bag, as she turned around to leave again. </p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;No, wait, just wait, alright?&rsquo;&lsquo; The boy grabbed her wrist quickly, spinning her around to face him. &lsquo;&lsquo;Just let me apologise.&rsquo;&lsquo; Y/N only lowered her head and nodded. </p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;It was very rude of me to snap at you like that. My mum would have been <i>very</i>disappointed with me if she knew. So I&rsquo;m sorry, it wasn&rsquo;t nice at all.&rsquo;&lsquo; He said, but he quickly continued as the girl didn&rsquo;t reply.</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Just because I felt heartbroken because of a girl, it doesn&rsquo;t mean I should have been rude to someone else, who happened to be a girl as well.&rsquo;&lsquo; He tried to make her look at him or just look up, but she still kept her head low. His heart was beating fast because the girl was making him nervous.</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Once again, s&rsquo;alright.&rsquo;&lsquo; Y/N replied, simply because she didn&rsquo;t want to care and it was fine, she just shouldn&rsquo;t have bothered him. &lsquo;&lsquo;Just because of the fact that someone <i>broke you</i>, you shouldn&rsquo;t have the need <i>to break</i>. And it seemed like you were trying to break yourself even more, so I just wanted you to stop doing it.&rsquo;&lsquo; She quickly added, but still avoiding his gaze. </p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Can you look at me?&rsquo;&lsquo; He was standing really close now; their feet and body only inches apart. Y/N looked up, meeting his eyes; they weren&rsquo;t as angry as before and they seemed softer than the last time she looked into them. She didn&rsquo;t feel scared of him, but she couldn&rsquo;t lie and say she didn&rsquo;t feel intimidated by him. </p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Do you think you could forgive me?&rsquo;&rsquo; The boy whispered softly at her, like he didn&rsquo;t want anyone else to know about them, but Y/N just nodded and looked back down again. </p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;You were being nothing but nice to me,&rsquo;&lsquo; he put his index finger under her chin &nbsp;pushing it up to meet her eyes, &lsquo;&lsquo;and your voice was nothing but soft and your touch was gentle. I do appreciate the gesture and your gentleness, it did feel very&hellip; comforting. And <i>I</i> was a dick, to <i>you</i>. So I hope you can forgive me, because I feel bad for snapping at you.&rsquo;&lsquo; He kept the eye contact through the whole conversation, desperate for her to forgive because in the pit of his stomach he felt really bad for the way he reacted. </p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I guess I forgive you, if that makes you feel better.&rsquo;&lsquo; Y/N shrugged her shoulders.</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t forgive me to make me feel better. Do it if you think you should, because I was a dick, and you do have the right to be upset with me.&rsquo;&lsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;re not a dick. You were angry and I was intruding&hellip; but yeah, it&rsquo;s fine, really.&rsquo;&lsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Well, thank you.. You weren&rsquo;t intruding, and I am really sorry.&rsquo;&lsquo; The boy gently placed his hand over her, giving it a light squeeze. &lsquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m Harry, by the way.&rsquo;&lsquo; He added, smiling softly at her. </p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I am Y/N, it&rsquo;s nice to meet you Harry.&rsquo;&lsquo; Y/N cocked her head to the side, giving him a smile while she could feel her cheeks become a bit warm from the gentle touch. </p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I really hope it is.&rsquo;&lsquo;</p><p>It was weird, because only hours ago Harry was an angry man ready to smash each and every single thing once he would have arrived home, but yet when he heard Y/N speak it was like everything stopped, like his broken heart felt reassured that it was going to be whole again. </p><p><i>It was also going to be a strange story to tell how he had met his girl and the love of his life when he was mourning the heartbreak of one Harry thought was his. </i></p></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure>\n<p>Today was like any other day for Y/N, except when he walked in. </p>\n<p>Early in the morning, Y/N finished off her classes and went to work. But now, she was standing in a bus, waiting for the stop she gets off of so she could go home. Y/N was leaning against the metal pole, holding onto it tightly due to the bus&rsquo; sudden jerks and speedy movements; she had her bag under her arm pressing it against her body, as every one always warned her that someone might always try and steal it. </p>\n<p>Sometimes, standing in a bus made Y/N realise how much she wanted to have money to buy herself a car so she would never have to take the public transport again. But being a full-time student and only a part-time worker, the pay wasn&rsquo;t exactly high enough to provide money for a car as well, so she had to make it work and accept the public transport as it was. </p>\n<p>As a person, Y/N was a very gentle and caring soul. Even though when she would have the worst day, she still managed to fight a smile through; even when she was feeling tired and she didn&rsquo;t feel like standing, she would give her seat up for someone else. Even when she was running late or really busy, Y/N would still make time to help an elderly person cross the street or help them with their bags; it was just how she was raised - to help people and care about them. So it wasn&rsquo;t the biggest surprise to her family and friends when Y/N told them she wanted to study defectology and psychology both at the same time; it wasn&rsquo;t a surprise because that was all Y/N ever wanted.</p>\n</p>",
