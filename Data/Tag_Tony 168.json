        "body": "<p>\u201cSteve?\u201d Tony\u2019s voice had a hint of longing; he hadn&rsquo;t seen\nhis boyfriend in days, he&rsquo;d been on a mission and Jarvis had just informed him\nhis super solider was home. </p><p>\u201cTones, hey handsome.\u201d He looked guilty with his hand\nrubbing at the back of his neck, still looking dirty and in his suit, not\nmeeting Tony\u2019s eyes. He was taking up the whole doorway and shifting on his\nfeet awkwardly like he wanted to pace. </p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Tony knew his man better than he thought,\nby the surprised look he shot him. </p><p>Steve hesitated, looking lost for words. After a few moments\nSteve was getting shoved out of the way and there was Bucky. Fucking Bucky.\nAlways back to Bucky aren\u2019t we? Tony knew better than to be surprised. He took\na step back instantly when locking eyes with the Winter Soldier. </p><p>\u201cTony, wait a second. Please.\u201d Steve sounded pained. Tony\ncouldn\u2019t spare him a glance still staring at Winter Solider, the man that\nkilled his parents. The man that had this fucking crazy hold on Steve that\napparently will never go away. </p><p>\u201cNothing to explain, Cap.\u201d Tony tried to ignore the hard\nflinch from him at the name. \u201cEverything\u2019s perfectly clear.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTony, it isn\u2019t, the three of us need to sit and have a\ntalk. Right Buck? Bucky?\u201d the Winter Soldier wasn\u2019t answering just staring\nintently back at Tony. Tony had no idea what the fuck was going on with this\nstaring match or the fact Steve wasn\u2019t making sense but he was 100% outta here.\nHe took 3 more steps backwards toward the other exit and that seemed to snap\nBucky out of it. </p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d Bucky\u2019s voice was rough. It was the first time\nthey\u2019ve talked since the day Tony ripped off Bucky\u2019s arm. \u201cDon\u2019t walk away from\nus.\u201d </p><p>Tony was instantly scoffing at the command that felt like a\nfucking threat. \u201cFuck you both. Like I said, I get it. It\u2019ll always be Cap and\nhis Solider, right? No room for Tony, obviously. No other reason you&rsquo;d be here,\nat my home than to tell me so. Is there solider? Exactly.\u201d Tony was gone before\nthey could respond escaping to his workshop. </p><p>\u201cBucky?! That the fuck was that? We were supposed to break\nit to him gently!\u201d Steve\u2019s voice was loud and full of panic. </p><p>\u201cFuck, Stevie. I have no idea what happened. I just heard\nhis voice and it\u2019s been so fucking long..\u201d Bucky\u2019s voice trailed off as his mind\nwas racing. Tony looked fucking good, too good. And hearing his loving voice\ntoward Stevie had set something off in him. \u201cI wanted him to talk to me they\nway he was with you.. The longing.. before he saw me. Fuck.\u201d He probably wasn\u2019t\nmaking sense but Steve knew him better than anyone. </p><p>\u201cI know Buck. Crap. We&rsquo;ll figure this out.\u201d Bucky wasn\u2019t\nsure if he was trying to convince him or himself more. </p><p>~~</p><p>\u201cJarvis? Where\u2019s Tony?\u201d Steve was pacing again. \u201cStill the\nworkshop, Sir.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCan you let me in? I need to see him.\u201d </p><p>The AI hesitated \u201cFull blackout, Sir.\u201d </p><p>Fuck. \u201cIs he okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe is.. not in danger, Captain.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIs he drinking?! I\u2019ll break in his door. Screw his\nblackout.\u201d Now he was pissed.</p><p>\u201cSorry Capitan, I\u2019m not able to say.\u201d Which was an answer\nenough for Steve. No matter how much he wanted to go in the workshop he knew\nbreaking Tony\u2019s things wasn\u2019t the best idea. Not to get where he wanted to with\nhim and Buck. Instead he went to Tony\u2019s room took a shower than laid in the\nbed. He was still exhausted from his mission and all he wanted was some cuddles\nwith Tony before he fucked the shit out of him. But imagining him and Bucky\nruining the genius was enough to just bring Buck home with him before really\nthinking it through. Obviously. </p><p>Steve let out a rough sigh and let his eyes slide close the\nexhaustion eating away at him.</p><p>~~</p><p>Bucky was in the vents heading to the workshop. He overheard\nthe conversation Steve and the AI had, and knowing better than to break the\ndoor down to see Tony he thought of another way. He just needed to explain. </p><p>Tony was deep in thought working on something Bucky couldn\u2019t\nmake out what but he could see the way Tony\u2019s eyes were rimmed slightly red. <i>Fuck me.</i> Thought Bucky as he snuck out\nof the vent. </p><p>\u201cWe both want you. We want all three of us to be..\ntogether.\u201d Bucky had no idea why the fuck he just went out and said it like\nthat but it\u2019s too late now. </p><p>The genius\u2019 head snapped to him took a breath, \u201cCome on, our\nCap? I\u2019m sure.\u201d Bucky tried not to let the \u2018our\u2019 get to his head.</p><p>\u201cHe suggested it. Said he loves you more than anything but\nhe still kinda loves me too. And we both get if you can\u2019t handle that, I\u2019ll be\ngone in an instant. Like nothin&rsquo; happened.\u201d </p><p>Tony was quite for awhile. \u201cAnd what about you, Buck?\u201d\nhearing Tony call him that almost had him going cross-eyed in pleasure. </p><p>\u201cOh baby, \u00a0I want to\nown both ya&rsquo;, ruin your ass and fuck Stevie\u2019s pretty face.\u201d He felt his accent dripping\nout with each second he thought more about it. Fuckin\u2019 beautiful. Bucky could\nsee where Tony clenched his legs together and shifted his body to him. Little\nTones was interested. </p><p>\u201cI mean, after everything..\u201d He managed to sigh out. </p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s why we wanted to talk.\u201d Tony just hummed in\nresponse. </p><p>\u201cThink it over, beautiful.\u201d Bucky kissed the top of his head\nas he walked passed and out the main doors. </p><p>\u201cWell, shit.\u201d Tony sighed again feeling his eyes start to\ndroop even though his brain was running a mile a minute. He really wanted to\nsnuggle with Steve.. He had missed him so much and they didn\u2019t even have their\nproper welcome home routine. </p><p>\u201cJarvis, where\u2019s Steve? Can you show me him?\u201d next thing he\nsaw was his man passed out in their bed. His chest ached with longing. Fuck it.\nHe headed to his room. </p><p>He quickly snuggled next to Steve, and Steve was instantly\nwrapping his arms around him like he was just waiting for Tony. </p><p>\u201cLove you, Tones.\u201d Steve mumbled out. </p><p>\u201cFuck Steve, I love you too.\u201d Tony squished himself closer\nto his man and let his brain finally shut off. </p><p>~~</p><p>Tony woke up feeling warm. Hot even. He blinked his eyes\nopen to see Bucky of all people wrapped around him. Tony felt his heart speed\nup in scared confusion. He started to scoot back to escape the Winter Soldier\nto feel another body behind him, he peeked over his shoulder to see his Cap.\nHis heart calmed instantly, letting the memories of the night before to wash\nover him. Tony wasn\u2019t going to lie, he loved this feeling of both of them snuggled\nup with him. Though he was warm.. maybe it would be different if he was naked..</p><p><i>No brain wait. This is\nBucky. Murderer of my parents. Hello. </i></p><p>But the other half of himself was saying he was brainwashed\nand hadn&rsquo;t meant to. Well he knew that for awhile but he didn\u2019t want to give in\nso easy, yet he couldn&rsquo;t lie he wanted this. Them. Fuck. </p><p>\u201cStop thinking so hard, baby.\u201d Bucky growled out in his\nstill asleep voice. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who told me to think about it.\u201d Tony rolled\nhis eyes. </p><p>\u201cHmm, not so loud though Tones, I can hear you thinking from\nhere.\u201d Steve\u2019s voice said and rubbed his nose along Tony\u2019s neck. </p><p>Tony scoffed and said, \u201cSo let\u2019s talk before I start giving\nyou or Bucky head. I missed out on our routine last night, hun.\u201d Tony wasn\u2019t a\npatient man. </p><p>\u201cJesus, Tony.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure who said it or if they both\ndid. </p><p>\u201cWell, \u00a0I of course\nwant to stay with you forever handsome. But I um kinda want Bucky to join us..\u201d\nTony rolled his eyes. </p><p>\u201cI got that, Steve. What else?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, baby.\u201d Bucky whispered in his ear. \u201cJoin you guys in\nforever. Not just a quick threeway.\u201d </p><p>Oh. Oh. <i>Oh.</i>\n\u201cReally?\u201d they were both quiet while Tony thought about it. It sounded like\nfun, and honestly he could figure it out with them later.. He kinda wanted them\nnow. </p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Tony shrugged. </p><p>\u201cWait, really?\u201d he still couldn\u2019t tell who was who, with the\nway his eyes were closed and he started rocking his hips against Steve\u2019s hard\ncock. </p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Tony agreed. \u201cBucky has always been a fucking hottie,\neven if he killed my parents. But he was brainwashed. And for Steve to love\nyou, you must be a good guy..\u201d apparently he really was okay with this. The\nsuper soldiers didn\u2019t wait a second longer, suddenly Steve was rocking along\nwith Tony\u2019s hips and that had Tony moaning. And Bucky started kissing on Tony\u2019s\nneck while his hands explored lower toward Tony\u2019s cock. </p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Tony whimpered when Bucky grabbed him through his\nboxers and Steve rocked against him hard. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it baby, let me hear you.\u201d Bucky moaned in his ear\nsucking multiple love bites on to his neck, Tony moaned loud at that. </p><p>\u201cFuck, you two are fucking sexy to watch.\u201d Steve grunted\nclose from behind Tony. </p><p>\u201cYou wanna watch me fuck your boyfriend, Stevie? Wanna see\nme take apart our Tones here?\u201d Steve and Tony moaned at that. Fuck Tony didn\u2019t\nknow how hot this\u2019d be. </p><p>\u201cPlease, Steve let Bucky fuck me. Please, hun.\u201d Tony was a\nmess with Steve rocking his hips hard at their words and Bucky teasing his cock\nstill. </p><p>\u201cFuck him.\u201d Steve ignored Tony and answered Bucky. Before\nTony could realize what was happening Bucky was pulling off his boxers and\nlaying Tony on his back, spreading his legs. </p><p>\u201cStevie, fuck his throat while I fuck this beautiful little\nhole.\u201d Bucky ordered. Steve did as Bucky said and positioned himself above\nTony. \u201cOpen up beautiful.\u201d Steve said as he rubbing his head along Tony\u2019s lips.\nTony complied and took him deep.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Tony.\u201d Steve groaned. Then there were fingers inside\nhim, and Tony being too distracted with Steve moaned on Steve\u2019s cock in surprise.\n</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it baby, take \u2018em.\u201d Bucky groaned out spreading Tony\nharder. Tony rocked his hips to meet Bucky\u2019s fingers. Feeling so full yet not\nfull enough. </p><p>\u201cFuck him.\u201d Steve moaned when Tony gagged a little on his\ncock. </p><p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d Bucky gave him a mock salute and rolled his eyes,\nbut he did take his fingers out of Tony and sucked on them while he put some\nlube on his cock, then lined up. Tony had no idea where the lube came from but\nhe was a little too busy to really ask.. the next thing he knew Bucky was\nsinking into him. Tony screamed around Steve\u2019s cock, making Steve rock into his\nface harder than he was. </p><p>Soon they had a rhythm, and Tony couldn\u2019t fucking think\nstraight. Buck\u2019s cock was so different than Steve\u2019s; thicker and he fucked Tony\nwas more aggressively than his Cap who was still thick but more long. Steve\nliked to tease Tony as long as he could with tortuous strokes, Bucky was\nruthless it was heaven. </p><p>\u201cFuck Tony, I\u2019m about to come so deep in your throat. You\nready baby? Want my come?\u201d Steve was growling and fucking his face with\nabandon. Tony was moaning and trying to nod, drool everywhere and sweat along\nhis body. Then there was the telltale sign of Steve coming, he held still and\nhe shoved as deep as possible into Tony\u2019s throat and came hard. Tony tried to swallow\nit all down, he knew how much his Cap loved that, but some still ended up\ncoming out of his mouth. Steve\u2019s legs must have gave out because he collapsed back\nwith a groan. </p><p>\u201cFucking shit, you two.\u201d Bucky was pounding into him even\nharder than before. \u201cCome on baby, want you to come on daddy\u2019s cock. Need to\nfeel it.\u201d Tony was so fucking close, he wanted to come for Bucky so bad, but\nsomething was missing. </p><p>\u201cCome, Tony. Come on Buck\u2019s cock.\u201d Steve whispered in his\near softly while petting his hair, and Tony came. </p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d he shouted his body shaking hard, and then he felt\nBucky shoot deep inside him. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it baby boy, milk me dry.\u201d Tony was honestly shocked\nat Bucky\u2019s dirty mouth. </p><p>Next thing he knew he was wrapped in two sets of arm\u2019s being\nsnuggled. </p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Was all Tony could think to say. </p><p>\u201cI see that daddy kink still hasn\u2019t gone away.\u201d Steve chuckled\nas he kissed at Tony\u2019s neck. </p><p>\u201cFuck you, punk.\u201d Bucky grumbled out petting Tony\u2019s hair. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think you\u2019ll need a second to fuck me, jerk. Tones ass\nis another level.\u201d Steve wrapped his legs in both Tony\u2019s and Buck\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cAmen.\u201d Bucky agreed.

            "comment": "<p>\u201cSteve?\u201d Tony\u2019s voice had a hint of longing; he hadn\u2019t seen\nhis boyfriend in days, he\u2019d been on a mission and Jarvis had just informed him\nhis super solider was home. </p><p>\u201cTones, hey handsome.\u201d He looked guilty with his hand\nrubbing at the back of his neck, still looking dirty and in his suit, not\nmeeting Tony\u2019s eyes. He was taking up the whole doorway and shifting on his\nfeet awkwardly like he wanted to pace. </p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Tony knew his man better than he thought,\nby the surprised look he shot him. </p><p>Steve hesitated, looking lost for words. After a few moments\nSteve was getting shoved out of the way and there was Bucky. Fucking Bucky.\nAlways back to Bucky aren\u2019t we? Tony knew better than to be surprised. He took\na step back instantly when locking eyes with the Winter Soldier. </p><p>\u201cTony, wait a second. Please.\u201d Steve sounded pained. Tony\ncouldn\u2019t spare him a glance still staring at Winter Solider, the man that\nkilled his parents. The man that had this fucking crazy hold on Steve that\napparently will never go away. </p><p>\u201cNothing to explain, Cap.\u201d Tony tried to ignore the hard\nflinch from him at the name. \u201cEverything\u2019s perfectly clear.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTony, it isn\u2019t, the three of us need to sit and have a\ntalk. Right Buck? Bucky?\u201d the Winter Soldier wasn\u2019t answering just staring\nintently back at Tony. Tony had no idea what the fuck was going on with this\nstaring match or the fact Steve wasn\u2019t making sense but he was 100% outta here.\nHe took 3 more steps backwards toward the other exit and that seemed to snap\nBucky out of it. </p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d Bucky\u2019s voice was rough. It was the first time\nthey\u2019ve talked since the day Tony ripped off Bucky\u2019s arm. \u201cDon\u2019t walk away from\nus.\u201d </p><p>Tony was instantly scoffing at the command that felt like a\nfucking threat. \u201cFuck you both. Like I said, I get it. It\u2019ll always be Cap and\nhis Solider, right? No room for Tony, obviously. No other reason you\u2019d be here,\nat my home than to tell me so. Is there solider? Exactly.\u201d Tony was gone before\nthey could respond escaping to his workshop. </p><p>\u201cBucky?! That the fuck was that? We were supposed to break\nit to him gently!\u201d Steve\u2019s voice was loud and full of panic. </p><p>\u201cFuck, Stevie. I have no idea what happened. I just heard\nhis voice and it\u2019s been so fucking long..\u201d Bucky\u2019s voice trailed off as his mind\nwas racing. Tony looked fucking good, too good. And hearing his loving voice\ntoward Stevie had set something off in him. \u201cI wanted him to talk to me they\nway he was with you.. The longing.. before he saw me. Fuck.\u201d He probably wasn\u2019t\nmaking sense but Steve knew him better than anyone. </p><p>\u201cI know Buck. Crap. We\u2019ll figure this out.\u201d Bucky wasn\u2019t\nsure if he was trying to convince him or himself more. </p><p>~~</p><p>\u201cJarvis? Where\u2019s Tony?\u201d Steve was pacing again. \u201cStill the\nworkshop, Sir.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCan you let me in? I need to see him.\u201d </p><p>The AI hesitated \u201cFull blackout, Sir.\u201d </p><p>Fuck. \u201cIs he okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe is.. not in danger, Captain.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIs he drinking?! I\u2019ll break in his door. Screw his\nblackout.\u201d Now he was pissed.</p><p>\u201cSorry Capitan, I\u2019m not able to say.\u201d Which was an answer\nenough for Steve. No matter how much he wanted to go in the workshop he knew\nbreaking Tony\u2019s things wasn\u2019t the best idea. Not to get where he wanted to with\nhim and Buck. Instead he went to Tony\u2019s room took a shower than laid in the\nbed. He was still exhausted from his mission and all he wanted was some cuddles\nwith Tony before he fucked the shit out of him. But imagining him and Bucky\nruining the genius was enough to just bring Buck home with him before really\nthinking it through. Obviously. </p><p>Steve let out a rough sigh and let his eyes slide close the\nexhaustion eating away at him.</p><p>~~</p><p>Bucky was in the vents heading to the workshop. He overheard\nthe conversation Steve and the AI had, and knowing better than to break the\ndoor down to see Tony he thought of another way. He just needed to explain. </p><p>Tony was deep in thought working on something Bucky couldn\u2019t\nmake out what but he could see the way Tony\u2019s eyes were rimmed slightly red. <i>Fuck me.</i> Thought Bucky as he snuck out\nof the vent. </p><p>\u201cWe both want you. We want all three of us to be..\ntogether.\u201d Bucky had no idea why the fuck he just went out and said it like\nthat but it\u2019s too late now. </p><p>The genius\u2019 head snapped to him took a breath, \u201cCome on, our\nCap? I\u2019m sure.\u201d Bucky tried not to let the \u2018our\u2019 get to his head.</p><p>\u201cHe suggested it. Said he loves you more than anything but\nhe still kinda loves me too. And we both get if you can\u2019t handle that, I\u2019ll be\ngone in an instant. Like nothin\u2019 happened.\u201d </p><p>Tony was quite for awhile. \u201cAnd what about you, Buck?\u201d\nhearing Tony call him that almost had him going cross-eyed in pleasure. </p><p>\u201cOh baby, \u00a0I want to\nown both ya\u2019, ruin your ass and fuck Stevie\u2019s pretty face.\u201d He felt his accent dripping\nout with each second he thought more about it. Fuckin\u2019 beautiful. Bucky could\nsee where Tony clenched his legs together and shifted his body to him. Little\nTones was interested. </p><p>\u201cI mean, after everything..\u201d He managed to sigh out. </p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s why we wanted to talk.\u201d Tony just hummed in\nresponse. </p><p>\u201cThink it over, beautiful.\u201d Bucky kissed the top of his head\nas he walked passed and out the main doors. </p><p>\u201cWell, shit.\u201d Tony sighed again feeling his eyes start to\ndroop even though his brain was running a mile a minute. He really wanted to\nsnuggle with Steve.. He had missed him so much and they didn\u2019t even have their\nproper welcome home routine. </p><p>\u201cJarvis, where\u2019s Steve? Can you show me him?\u201d next thing he\nsaw was his man passed out in their bed. His chest ached with longing. Fuck it.\nHe headed to his room. </p><p>He quickly snuggled next to Steve, and Steve was instantly\nwrapping his arms around him like he was just waiting for Tony. </p><p>\u201cLove you, Tones.\u201d Steve mumbled out. </p><p>\u201cFuck Steve, I love you too.\u201d Tony squished himself closer\nto his man and let his brain finally shut off. </p><p>~~</p><p>Tony woke up feeling warm. Hot even. He blinked his eyes\nopen to see Bucky of all people wrapped around him. Tony felt his heart speed\nup in scared confusion. He started to scoot back to escape the Winter Soldier\nto feel another body behind him, he peeked over his shoulder to see his Cap.\nHis heart calmed instantly, letting the memories of the night before to wash\nover him. Tony wasn\u2019t going to lie, he loved this feeling of both of them snuggled\nup with him. Though he was warm.. maybe it would be different if he was naked..</p><p><i>No brain wait. This is\nBucky. Murderer of my parents. Hello. </i></p><p>But the other half of himself was saying he was brainwashed\nand hadn\u2019t meant to. Well he knew that for awhile but he didn\u2019t want to give in\nso easy, yet he couldn\u2019t lie he wanted this. Them. Fuck. </p><p>\u201cStop thinking so hard, baby.\u201d Bucky growled out in his\nstill asleep voice. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who told me to think about it.\u201d Tony rolled\nhis eyes. </p><p>\u201cHmm, not so loud though Tones, I can hear you thinking from\nhere.\u201d Steve\u2019s voice said and rubbed his nose along Tony\u2019s neck. </p><p>Tony scoffed and said, \u201cSo let\u2019s talk before I start giving\nyou or Bucky head. I missed out on our routine last night, hun.\u201d Tony wasn\u2019t a\npatient man. </p><p>\u201cJesus, Tony.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure who said it or if they both\ndid. </p><p>\u201cWell, \u00a0I of course\nwant to stay with you forever handsome. But I um kinda want Bucky to join us..\u201d\nTony rolled his eyes. </p><p>\u201cI got that, Steve. What else?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, baby.\u201d Bucky whispered in his ear. \u201cJoin you guys in\nforever. Not just a quick threeway.\u201d </p><p>Oh. Oh. <i>Oh.</i>\n\u201cReally?\u201d they were both quiet while Tony thought about it. It sounded like\nfun, and honestly he could figure it out with them later.. He kinda wanted them\nnow. </p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Tony shrugged. </p><p>\u201cWait, really?\u201d he still couldn\u2019t tell who was who, with the\nway his eyes were closed and he started rocking his hips against Steve\u2019s hard\ncock. </p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Tony agreed. \u201cBucky has always been a fucking hottie,\neven if he killed my parents. But he was brainwashed. And for Steve to love\nyou, you must be a good guy..\u201d apparently he really was okay with this. The\nsuper soldiers didn\u2019t wait a second longer, suddenly Steve was rocking along\nwith Tony\u2019s hips and that had Tony moaning. And Bucky started kissing on Tony\u2019s\nneck while his hands explored lower toward Tony\u2019s cock. </p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Tony whimpered when Bucky grabbed him through his\nboxers and Steve rocked against him hard. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it baby, let me hear you.\u201d Bucky moaned in his ear\nsucking multiple love bites on to his neck, Tony moaned loud at that. </p><p>\u201cFuck, you two are fucking sexy to watch.\u201d Steve grunted\nclose from behind Tony. </p><p>\u201cYou wanna watch me fuck your boyfriend, Stevie? Wanna see\nme take apart our Tones here?\u201d Steve and Tony moaned at that. Fuck Tony didn\u2019t\nknow how hot this\u2019d be. </p><p>\u201cPlease, Steve let Bucky fuck me. Please, hun.\u201d Tony was a\nmess with Steve rocking his hips hard at their words and Bucky teasing his cock\nstill. </p><p>\u201cFuck him.\u201d Steve ignored Tony and answered Bucky. Before\nTony could realize what was happening Bucky was pulling off his boxers and\nlaying Tony on his back, spreading his legs. </p><p>\u201cStevie, fuck his throat while I fuck this beautiful little\nhole.\u201d Bucky ordered. Steve did as Bucky said and positioned himself above\nTony. \u201cOpen up beautiful.\u201d Steve said as he rubbing his head along Tony\u2019s lips.\nTony complied and took him deep.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Tony.\u201d Steve groaned. Then there were fingers inside\nhim, and Tony being too distracted with Steve moaned on Steve\u2019s cock in surprise.\n</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it baby, take \u2018em.\u201d Bucky groaned out spreading Tony\nharder. Tony rocked his hips to meet Bucky\u2019s fingers. Feeling so full yet not\nfull enough. </p><p>\u201cFuck him.\u201d Steve moaned when Tony gagged a little on his\ncock. </p><p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d Bucky gave him a mock salute and rolled his eyes,\nbut he did take his fingers out of Tony and sucked on them while he put some\nlube on his cock, then lined up.

Exactly.\u201d Tony was gone before\nthey could respond escaping to his workshop. </p><p>\u201cBucky?! That the fuck was that? We were supposed to break\nit to him gently!\u201d Steve\u2019s voice was loud and full of panic. </p><p>\u201cFuck, Stevie. I have no idea what happened. I just heard\nhis voice and it\u2019s been so fucking long..\u201d Bucky\u2019s voice trailed off as his mind\nwas racing. Tony looked fucking good, too good. And hearing his loving voice\ntoward Stevie had set something off in him. \u201cI wanted him to talk to me they\nway he was with you.. The longing.. before he saw me. Fuck.\u201d He probably wasn\u2019t\nmaking sense but Steve knew him better than anyone. </p><p>\u201cI know Buck. Crap.

I\u2019ll break in his door. Screw his\nblackout.\u201d Now he was pissed.</p><p>\u201cSorry Capitan, I\u2019m not able to say.\u201d Which was an answer\nenough for Steve. No matter how much he wanted to go in the workshop he knew\nbreaking Tony\u2019s things wasn\u2019t the best idea. Not to get where he wanted to with\nhim and Buck. Instead he went to Tony\u2019s room took a shower than laid in the\nbed. He was still exhausted from his mission and all he wanted was some cuddles\nwith Tony before he fucked the shit out of him. But imagining him and Bucky\nruining the genius was enough to just bring Buck home with him before really\nthinking it through. Obviously. </p><p>Steve let out a rough sigh and let his eyes slide close the\nexhaustion eating away at him.</p><p>~~</p><p>Bucky was in the vents heading to the workshop. He overheard\nthe conversation Steve and the AI had, and knowing better than to break the\ndoor down to see Tony he thought of another way. He just needed to explain. </p><p>Tony was deep in thought working on something Bucky couldn\u2019t\nmake out what but he could see the way Tony\u2019s eyes were rimmed slightly red. <i>Fuck me.</i> Thought Bucky as he snuck out\nof the vent. </p><p>\u201cWe both want you. We want all three of us to be..\ntogether.\u201d Bucky had no idea why the fuck he just went out and said it like\nthat but it\u2019s too late now. </p><p>The genius\u2019 head snapped to him took a breath, \u201cCome on, our\nCap? I\u2019m sure.\u201d Bucky tried not to let the \u2018our\u2019 get to his head.</p><p>\u201cHe suggested it. Said he loves you more than anything but\nhe still kinda loves me too. And we both get if you can\u2019t handle that, I\u2019ll be\ngone in an instant. Like nothin\u2019 happened.\u201d </p><p>Tony was quite for awhile. \u201cAnd what about you, Buck?\u201d\nhearing Tony call him that almost had him going cross-eyed in pleasure. </p><p>\u201cOh baby, \u00a0I want to\nown both ya\u2019, ruin your ass and fuck Stevie\u2019s pretty face.\u201d He felt his accent dripping\nout with each second he thought more about it. Fuckin\u2019 beautiful. Bucky could\nsee where Tony clenched his legs together and shifted his body to him. Little\nTones was interested. </p><p>\u201cI mean, after everything..\u201d He managed to sigh out. </p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s why we wanted to talk.\u201d Tony just hummed in\nresponse. </p><p>\u201cThink it over, beautiful.\u201d Bucky kissed the top of his head\nas he walked passed and out the main doors. </p><p>\u201cWell, shit.\u201d Tony sighed again feeling his eyes start to\ndroop even though his brain was running a mile a minute. He really wanted to\nsnuggle with Steve.. He had missed him so much and they didn\u2019t even have their\nproper welcome home routine. </p><p>\u201cJarvis, where\u2019s Steve? Can you show me him?\u201d next thing he\nsaw was his man passed out in their bed. His chest ached with longing. Fuck it.\nHe headed to his room. </p><p>He quickly snuggled next to Steve, and Steve was instantly\nwrapping his arms around him like he was just waiting for Tony. </p><p>\u201cLove you, Tones.\u201d Steve mumbled out. </p><p>\u201cFuck Steve, I love you too.\u201d Tony squished himself closer\nto his man and let his brain finally shut off. </p><p>~~</p><p>Tony woke up feeling warm. Hot even. He blinked his eyes\nopen to see Bucky of all people wrapped around him. Tony felt his heart speed\nup in scared confusion. He started to scoot back to escape the Winter Soldier\nto feel another body behind him, he peeked over his shoulder to see his Cap.\nHis heart calmed instantly, letting the memories of the night before to wash\nover him. Tony wasn\u2019t going to lie, he loved this feeling of both of them snuggled\nup with him. Though he was warm.. maybe it would be different if he was naked..</p><p><i>No brain wait. This is\nBucky. Murderer of my parents. Hello. </i></p><p>But the other half of himself was saying he was brainwashed\nand hadn\u2019t meant to. Well he knew that for awhile but he didn\u2019t want to give in\nso easy, yet he couldn\u2019t lie he wanted this. Them. Fuck. </p><p>\u201cStop thinking so hard, baby.\u201d Bucky growled out in his\nstill asleep voice. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who told me to think about it.\u201d Tony rolled\nhis eyes. </p><p>\u201cHmm, not so loud though Tones, I can hear you thinking from\nhere.\u201d Steve\u2019s voice said and rubbed his nose along Tony\u2019s neck. </p><p>Tony scoffed and said, \u201cSo let\u2019s talk before I start giving\nyou or Bucky head. I missed out on our routine last night, hun.\u201d Tony wasn\u2019t a\npatient man. </p><p>\u201cJesus, Tony.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure who said it or if they both\ndid. </p><p>\u201cWell, \u00a0I of course\nwant to stay with you forever handsome. But I um kinda want Bucky to join us..\u201d\nTony rolled his eyes. </p><p>\u201cI got that, Steve. What else?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, baby.\u201d Bucky whispered in his ear. \u201cJoin you guys in\nforever. Not just a quick threeway.\u201d </p><p>Oh. Oh. <i>Oh.</i>\n\u201cReally?\u201d they were both quiet while Tony thought about it. It sounded like\nfun, and honestly he could figure it out with them later.. He kinda wanted them\nnow. </p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Tony shrugged. </p><p>\u201cWait, really?\u201d he still couldn\u2019t tell who was who, with the\nway his eyes were closed and he started rocking his hips against Steve\u2019s hard\ncock. </p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Tony agreed. \u201cBucky has always been a fucking hottie,\neven if he killed my parents. But he was brainwashed. And for Steve to love\nyou, you must be a good guy..\u201d apparently he really was okay with this. The\nsuper soldiers didn\u2019t wait a second longer, suddenly Steve was rocking along\nwith Tony\u2019s hips and that had Tony moaning. And Bucky started kissing on Tony\u2019s\nneck while his hands explored lower toward Tony\u2019s cock. </p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Tony whimpered when Bucky grabbed him through his\nboxers and Steve rocked against him hard. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it baby, let me hear you.\u201d Bucky moaned in his ear\nsucking multiple love bites on to his neck, Tony moaned loud at that. </p><p>\u201cFuck, you two are fucking sexy to watch.\u201d Steve grunted\nclose from behind Tony. </p><p>\u201cYou wanna watch me fuck your boyfriend, Stevie? Wanna see\nme take apart our Tones here?\u201d Steve and Tony moaned at that. Fuck Tony didn\u2019t\nknow how hot this\u2019d be. </p><p>\u201cPlease, Steve let Bucky fuck me. Please, hun.\u201d Tony was a\nmess with Steve rocking his hips hard at their words and Bucky teasing his cock\nstill. </p><p>\u201cFuck him.\u201d Steve ignored Tony and answered Bucky. Before\nTony could realize what was happening Bucky was pulling off his boxers and\nlaying Tony on his back, spreading his legs. </p><p>\u201cStevie, fuck his throat while I fuck this beautiful little\nhole.\u201d Bucky ordered. Steve did as Bucky said and positioned himself above\nTony. \u201cOpen up beautiful.\u201d Steve said as he rubbing his head along Tony\u2019s lips.\nTony complied and took him deep.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Tony.\u201d Steve groaned. Then there were fingers inside\nhim, and Tony being too distracted with Steve moaned on Steve\u2019s cock in surprise.\n</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it baby, take \u2018em.\u201d Bucky groaned out spreading Tony\nharder. Tony rocked his hips to meet Bucky\u2019s fingers. Feeling so full yet not\nfull enough. </p><p>\u201cFuck him.\u201d Steve moaned when Tony gagged a little on his\ncock. </p><p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d Bucky gave him a mock salute and rolled his eyes,\nbut he did take his fingers out of Tony and sucked on them while he put some\nlube on his cock, then lined up. Tony had no idea where the lube came from but\nhe was a little too busy to really ask.. the next thing he knew Bucky was\nsinking into him. Tony screamed around Steve\u2019s cock, making Steve rock into his\nface harder than he was. </p><p>Soon they had a rhythm, and Tony couldn\u2019t fucking think\nstraight. Buck\u2019s cock was so different than Steve\u2019s; thicker and he fucked Tony\nwas more aggressively than his Cap who was still thick but more long. Steve\nliked to tease Tony as long as he could with tortuous strokes, Bucky was\nruthless it was heaven. </p><p>\u201cFuck Tony, I\u2019m about to come so deep in your throat. You\nready baby? Want my come?\u201d Steve was growling and fucking his face with\nabandon. Tony was moaning and trying to nod, drool everywhere and sweat along\nhis body. Then there was the telltale sign of Steve coming, he held still and\nhe shoved as deep as possible into Tony\u2019s throat and came hard. Tony tried to swallow\nit all down, he knew how much his Cap loved that, but some still ended up\ncoming out of his mouth. Steve\u2019s legs must have gave out because he collapsed back\nwith a groan. </p><p>\u201cFucking shit, you two.\u201d Bucky was pounding into him even\nharder than before. \u201cCome on baby, want you to come on daddy\u2019s cock. Need to\nfeel it.\u201d Tony was so fucking close, he wanted to come for Bucky so bad, but\nsomething was missing. </p><p>\u201cCome, Tony. Come on Buck\u2019s cock.\u201d Steve whispered in his\near softly while petting his hair, and Tony came. </p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d he shouted his body shaking hard, and then he felt\nBucky shoot deep inside him. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it baby boy, milk me dry.\u201d Tony was honestly shocked\nat Bucky\u2019s dirty mouth. </p><p>Next thing he knew he was wrapped in two sets of arm\u2019s being\nsnuggled. </p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Was all Tony could think to say. </p><p>\u201cI see that daddy kink still hasn\u2019t gone away.\u201d Steve chuckled\nas he kissed at Tony\u2019s neck. </p><p>\u201cFuck you, punk.\u201d Bucky grumbled out petting Tony\u2019s hair. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think you\u2019ll need a second to fuck me, jerk. Tones ass\nis another level.\u201d Steve wrapped his legs in both Tony\u2019s and Buck\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cAmen.\u201d Bucky agreed. Tony blushed, \u201cFuck you both, also\nBucky the mouth on you is quite a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm, he\u2019s always been like that in bed, Tones. I knew you\u2019d\nlike it. Sometimes I\u2019m too wrapped in my head to give you the vocal shit you\nlike. And I know you don\u2019t like to top, and I like both so uh.. When I saw\nBucky on the mission we ended up talking and he brought it to my attention he\u2019d\nlove to ravish your ass, I kinda brought him home before I really thought of a\nplan.. I\u2019m sorry baby.\u201d Tony could tell Steve was still upset about the black\nout with the workshop yesterday. Which was understandable, Tony hadn\u2019t had a\nblack out in years. At least one that Steve wasn\u2019t aloud into. </p><p>\u201cMy strategic boyfriend brought home his past lover to share\nand didn\u2019t think of a plan first. Wow hun. Who are you?\u201d Tony teased. \u201cIt\u2019s\nokay though, I just missed you so much. And then you came home with him.. I\njust acted before thinking, or giving you a chance to explain.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWho? My genius man forgot to think? I think me and Buck are\nthe only ones with the privilege to say that, huh Buck?\u201d Bucky snorted and pinched\nSteve\u2019s arm. </p><p>\u201cTones was crying asshole.\u201d Tony was shocked in betrayal. </p><p>\u201cBUCKY!\u201d Tony complained. </p><p>\u201cBaby.. you were crying? Really?\u201d Steve looked torn up..\n\u201cTones, I thought you were drinking.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, well I let you think that, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Tony crossed his\narms in a pout, put out Bucky spilled the beans.</p><p>\u201cWait, Buck how do you know?\u201d Steve instantly sounded\njealous. \u201cYou let Bucky in but not me, Tony?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNO! God.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI snuck in the vents.\u201d Bucky said at the same time. </p><p>\u201cOh. Oh. Why didn\u2019t I think of that?\u201d Tony just rolled his\neyes. </p><p>\u201cWe have a lot to figure out..\u201d Tony whispered. </p><p>\u201cYes, and we have time. Lets just enjoy this.\u201d Steve said\nand hugged them both close. </p><p>\u201cLove you, Steve.\u201d Tony sighed out snuggling close to him\nand pulling Bucky with. </p><p>\u201cLove you Tones.\u201d Steve chuckled. </p><p>\u201cI suppose we can keep him for now.\u201d Tony said to Steve. </p><p>\u201cI feel like you\u2019d be happy if you did.\u201d Steve laughed\nagain. </p><p>\u201cBucky?\u201d Tony mumbled feeling tired again. </p><p>\u201cYes Tones?\u201d The winter solider sounded worried. </p><p>\u201cI like you, for now.\u201d Bucky let out a loud laugh. \u201cI\u2019ve\nliked you for a while handsome. This will work, and if not like I said before\nI\u2019ll leave. Love you also, Stevie.\u201d </p><p>Steve hesitated and at Tony\u2019s subtle nudge he responded, \u201cI\nalways loved ya Buck.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGood, now naps.\u201d Tony yawned. The guys looked at each other\nover Tony and sent each other smiling glances. Guess this worked out better\nthan they hoped. </p>",

I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo; Bucky tried not to let the &lsquo;our&rsquo; get to his head.</p><p>&ldquo;He suggested it. Said he loves you more than anything but\nhe still kinda loves me too. And we both get if you can&rsquo;t handle that, I&rsquo;ll be\ngone in an instant. Like nothin&rsquo; happened.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony was quite for awhile. &ldquo;And what about you, Buck?&rdquo;\nhearing Tony call him that almost had him going cross-eyed in pleasure. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh baby, &nbsp;I want to\nown both ya&rsquo;, ruin your ass and fuck Stevie&rsquo;s pretty face.&rdquo; He felt his accent dripping\nout with each second he thought more about it. Fuckin&rsquo; beautiful. Bucky could\nsee where Tony clenched his legs together and shifted his body to him. Little\nTones was interested. </p><p>&ldquo;I mean, after everything..&rdquo; He managed to sigh out. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s why we wanted to talk.&rdquo; Tony just hummed in\nresponse. </p><p>&ldquo;Think it over, beautiful.&rdquo; Bucky kissed the top of his head\nas he walked passed and out the main doors. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, shit.&rdquo; Tony sighed again feeling his eyes start to\ndroop even though his brain was running a mile a minute. He really wanted to\nsnuggle with Steve.. He had missed him so much and they didn&rsquo;t even have their\nproper welcome home routine. </p><p>&ldquo;Jarvis, where&rsquo;s Steve? Can you show me him?&rdquo; next thing he\nsaw was his man passed out in their bed. His chest ached with longing. Fuck it.\nHe headed to his room. </p><p>He quickly snuggled next to Steve, and Steve was instantly\nwrapping his arms around him like he was just waiting for Tony. </p><p>&ldquo;Love you, Tones.&rdquo; Steve mumbled out. </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck Steve, I love you too.&rdquo; Tony squished himself closer\nto his man and let his brain finally shut off. </p><p>~~</p><p>Tony woke up feeling warm. Hot even. He blinked his eyes\nopen to see Bucky of all people wrapped around him. Tony felt his heart speed\nup in scared confusion. He started to scoot back to escape the Winter Soldier\nto feel another body behind him, he peeked over his shoulder to see his Cap.\nHis heart calmed instantly, letting the memories of the night before to wash\nover him. Tony wasn&rsquo;t going to lie, he loved this feeling of both of them snuggled\nup with him. Though he was warm.. maybe it would be different if he was naked..</p><p><i>No brain wait. This is\nBucky. Murderer of my parents. Hello. </i></p><p>But the other half of himself was saying he was brainwashed\nand hadn&rsquo;t meant to. Well he knew that for awhile but he didn&rsquo;t want to give in\nso easy, yet he couldn&rsquo;t lie he wanted this. Them. Fuck. </p><p>&ldquo;Stop thinking so hard, baby.&rdquo; Bucky growled out in his\nstill asleep voice. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one who told me to think about it.&rdquo; Tony rolled\nhis eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Hmm, not so loud though Tones, I can hear you thinking from\nhere.&rdquo; Steve&rsquo;s voice said and rubbed his nose along Tony&rsquo;s neck. </p><p>Tony scoffed and said, &ldquo;So let&rsquo;s talk before I start giving\nyou or Bucky head. I missed out on our routine last night, hun.&rdquo; Tony wasn&rsquo;t a\npatient man. </p><p>&ldquo;Jesus, Tony.&rdquo; He wasn&rsquo;t sure who said it or if they both\ndid. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, &nbsp;I of course\nwant to stay with you forever handsome. But I um kinda want Bucky to join us..&rdquo;\nTony rolled his eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;I got that, Steve. What else?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No, baby.&rdquo; Bucky whispered in his ear. &ldquo;Join you guys in\nforever. Not just a quick threeway.&rdquo; </p><p>Oh. Oh. <i>Oh.</i>\n&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; they were both quiet while Tony thought about it. It sounded like\nfun, and honestly he could figure it out with them later.. He kinda wanted them\nnow. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; Tony shrugged. </p><p>&ldquo;Wait, really?&rdquo; he still couldn&rsquo;t tell who was who, with the\nway his eyes were closed and he started rocking his hips against Steve&rsquo;s hard\ncock. </p><p>&ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo; Tony agreed. &ldquo;Bucky has always been a fucking hottie,\neven if he killed my parents. But he was brainwashed. And for Steve to love\nyou, you must be a good guy..&rdquo; apparently he really was okay with this. The\nsuper soldiers didn&rsquo;t wait a second longer, suddenly Steve was rocking along\nwith Tony&rsquo;s hips and that had Tony moaning. And Bucky started kissing on Tony&rsquo;s\nneck while his hands explored lower toward Tony&rsquo;s cock. </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck.&rdquo; Tony whimpered when Bucky grabbed him through his\nboxers and Steve rocked against him hard. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it baby, let me hear you.&rdquo; Bucky moaned in his ear\nsucking multiple love bites on to his neck, Tony moaned loud at that. </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, you two are fucking sexy to watch.&rdquo; Steve grunted\nclose from behind Tony. </p><p>&ldquo;You wanna watch me fuck your boyfriend, Stevie? Wanna see\nme take apart our Tones here?&rdquo; Steve and Tony moaned at that. Fuck Tony didn&rsquo;t\nknow how hot this&rsquo;d be. </p><p>&ldquo;Please, Steve let Bucky fuck me. Please, hun.&rdquo; Tony was a\nmess with Steve rocking his hips hard at their words and Bucky teasing his cock\nstill. </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck him.&rdquo; Steve ignored Tony and answered Bucky. Before\nTony could realize what was happening Bucky was pulling off his boxers and\nlaying Tony on his back, spreading his legs. </p><p>&ldquo;Stevie, fuck his throat while I fuck this beautiful little\nhole.&rdquo; Bucky ordered. Steve did as Bucky said and positioned himself above\nTony. &ldquo;Open up beautiful.&rdquo; Steve said as he rubbing his head along Tony&rsquo;s lips.\nTony complied and took him deep.</p><p>&ldquo;Jesus, Tony.&rdquo; Steve groaned. Then there were fingers inside\nhim, and Tony being too distracted with Steve moaned on Steve&rsquo;s cock in surprise.\n</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it baby, take &lsquo;em.&rdquo; Bucky groaned out spreading Tony\nharder. Tony rocked his hips to meet Bucky&rsquo;s fingers. Feeling so full yet not\nfull enough. </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck him.&rdquo; Steve moaned when Tony gagged a little on his\ncock. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes sir.&rdquo; Bucky gave him a mock salute and rolled his eyes,\nbut he did take his fingers out of Tony and sucked on them while he put some\nlube on his cock, then lined up. Tony had no idea where the lube came from but\nhe was a little too busy to really ask.. the next thing he knew Bucky was\nsinking into him. Tony screamed around Steve&rsquo;s cock, making Steve rock into his\nface harder than he was. </p><p>Soon they had a rhythm, and Tony couldn&rsquo;t fucking think\nstraight. Buck&rsquo;s cock was so different than Steve&rsquo;s; thicker and he fucked Tony\nwas more aggressively than his Cap who was still thick but more long. Steve\nliked to tease Tony as long as he could with tortuous strokes, Bucky was\nruthless it was heaven. </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck Tony, I&rsquo;m about to come so deep in your throat. You\nready baby? Want my come?&rdquo; Steve was growling and fucking his face with\nabandon. Tony was moaning and trying to nod, drool everywhere and sweat along\nhis body. Then there was the telltale sign of Steve coming, he held still and\nhe shoved as deep as possible into Tony&rsquo;s throat and came hard. Tony tried to swallow\nit all down, he knew how much his Cap loved that, but some still ended up\ncoming out of his mouth. Steve&rsquo;s legs must have gave out because he collapsed back\nwith a groan. </p><p>&ldquo;Fucking shit, you two.&rdquo; Bucky was pounding into him even\nharder than before. &ldquo;Come on baby, want you to come on daddy&rsquo;s cock. Need to\nfeel it.&rdquo; Tony was so fucking close, he wanted to come for Bucky so bad, but\nsomething was missing. </p><p>&ldquo;Come, Tony. Come on Buck&rsquo;s cock.&rdquo; Steve whispered in his\near softly while petting his hair, and Tony came. </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck!&rdquo; he shouted his body shaking hard, and then he felt\nBucky shoot deep inside him. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it baby boy, milk me dry.&rdquo; Tony was honestly shocked\nat Bucky&rsquo;s dirty mouth. </p><p>Next thing he knew he was wrapped in two sets of arm&rsquo;s being\nsnuggled. </p><p>&ldquo;Wow.&rdquo; Was all Tony could think to say. </p><p>&ldquo;I see that daddy kink still hasn&rsquo;t gone away.&rdquo; Steve chuckled\nas he kissed at Tony&rsquo;s neck. </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck you, punk.&rdquo; Bucky grumbled out petting Tony&rsquo;s hair. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think you&rsquo;ll need a second to fuck me, jerk. Tones ass\nis another level.&rdquo; Steve wrapped his legs in both Tony&rsquo;s and Buck&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;Amen.&rdquo; Bucky agreed. Tony blushed, &ldquo;Fuck you both, also\nBucky the mouth on you is quite a surprise.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm, he&rsquo;s always been like that in bed, Tones. I knew you&rsquo;d\nlike it. Sometimes I&rsquo;m too wrapped in my head to give you the vocal shit you\nlike. And I know you don&rsquo;t like to top, and I like both so uh.. When I saw\nBucky on the mission we ended up talking and he brought it to my attention he&rsquo;d\nlove to ravish your ass, I kinda brought him home before I really thought of a\nplan.. I&rsquo;m sorry baby.&rdquo; Tony could tell Steve was still upset about the black\nout with the workshop yesterday. Which was understandable, Tony hadn&rsquo;t had a\nblack out in years. At least one that Steve wasn&rsquo;t aloud into. </p><p>&ldquo;My strategic boyfriend brought home his past lover to share\nand didn&rsquo;t think of a plan first. Wow hun. Who are you?&rdquo; Tony teased. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nokay though, I just missed you so much. And then you came home with him.. I\njust acted before thinking, or giving you a chance to explain.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Who? My genius man forgot to think? I think me and Buck are\nthe only ones with the privilege to say that, huh Buck?&rdquo; Bucky snorted and pinched\nSteve&rsquo;s arm. </p><p>&ldquo;Tones was crying asshole.&rdquo; Tony was shocked in betrayal. </p><p>&ldquo;BUCKY!&rdquo; Tony complained. </p><p>&ldquo;Baby.. you were crying? Really?&rdquo; Steve looked torn up..\n&ldquo;Tones, I thought you were drinking.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, well I let you think that, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; Tony crossed his\narms in a pout, put out Bucky spilled the beans.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, Buck how do you know?&rdquo; Steve instantly sounded\njealous. &ldquo;You let Bucky in but not me, Tony?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;NO! God.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I snuck in the vents.&rdquo; Bucky said at the same time. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh. Oh. Why didn&rsquo;t I think of that?&rdquo; Tony just rolled his\neyes. </p><p>&ldquo;We have a lot to figure out..&rdquo; Tony whispered. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, and we have time. Lets just enjoy this.&rdquo; Steve said\nand hugged them both close. </p><p>&ldquo;Love you, Steve.&rdquo; Tony sighed out snuggling close to him\nand pulling Bucky with. </p><p>&ldquo;Love you Tones.&rdquo; Steve chuckled. </p><p>&ldquo;I suppose we can keep him for now.&rdquo; Tony said to Steve. </p><p>&ldquo;I feel like you&rsquo;d be happy if you did.&rdquo; Steve laughed\nagain. </p><p>&ldquo;Bucky?&rdquo; Tony mumbled feeling tired again. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes Tones?&rdquo; The winter solider sounded worried. </p><p>&ldquo;I like you, for now.&rdquo; Bucky let out a loud laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve\nliked you for a while handsome. This will work, and if not like I said before\nI&rsquo;ll leave. Love you also, Stevie.&rdquo; </p><p>Steve hesitated and at Tony&rsquo;s subtle nudge he responded, &ldquo;I\nalways loved ya Buck.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Good, now naps.&rdquo; Tony yawned. The guys looked at each other\nover Tony and sent each other smiling glances. Guess this worked out better\nthan they hoped. </p>",
