That screams for stupid ideas. <br/><b>A/N:</b> Collection of works for KiriBakuWeek 2019. First time writing KiriBaku, they deserve so much love. Ha.<br/></p><p>You can read chapter 2 on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/18557164/chapters/44032582\" target=\"_blank\">AO3</a> if you want to! :)</p><!-- more --><p>In record time, Eijirou thought he never ran this fast, he sprinted down the small space between the barracks and the castle walls, shot through the next door inside the east wing and ran towards the servants&rsquo; sleeping chambers. Fortunately for him, most servants were either occupied by the still ongoing banquet or were already in their rooms.</p><p>When he arrived at his door, he jerked it open and closed it immediately after he entered, leaning against the cold wood and catching his breath. His heart was still pounding against his rib cage, he thought it would crack through the bones.</p><p>\u201cEijirou!\u201d Mina jumped to her feet followed by Hanta, Denki nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Eijirou slowly slid down the door, huffing out a small whimper and buried his face in his knees. His friends were by his side right then, grabbing his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cW-what happen? You were gone for so long!\u201d Mina cried out, voice cracking with emotion.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re covered in dirt, what the hell?\u201d Hanta examined his attire, dusting off the slowly drying mud from his arms and shins.</p><p>\u201cSo many people\u2026 questions\u2026 prince\u2026 swords\u2026\u201d Eijirou pressed between tight lips. He grasped at his hair, groaning.</p><p>\u201cWhat?! Slow down, what happened?!\u201d Mina, slowly losing her patience, shook a little more insistent at his shoulder. Eijirou groaned again, trying to order his thoughts himself. Hanta, an angel in disguise, held Mina\u2019s arm and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cLet the man breathe, he just needs a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we don\u2019t have a minute!\u201d Mina countered. \u201cEijirou, are you being followed? Did the prince send someone after you?\u201d Eijirou shook his head against his knees and only then Mina allowed herself to calm down. She let go of his shoulder and sat down next to him, Hanta following her example, all three with their backs against the door.</p><p>Eijirou drew his breaths in and out, slowly regaining control of his emotions. He let go of his hair and leaned his head against the door, blinking at the ceiling as if he just realized where he was.</p><p>\u201cThere were-\u201c, his voice broke and he had to clear his throat, \u201cthere were so many people, asking me all this stuff we thought up in advance and at first everything was fine. I just wanted to eat something and then leave, that would be enough. I was so afraid some of the servants would recognize me.\u201d He groaned again just imagining that.</p><p>\u201cAnd then\u201d, he blinked, swallowing, \u201cthe prince was there. I was introduced. To the prince. As a noble. To the prince. Guys, I talked to the prince! The prince of this very kingdom. Me!\u201d His eyes sprung back and forth between Mina and Hanta, growing more and more erratic as he spoke.</p><p>Hanta put a hand on his shoulder to calm him down. \u201cDid he notice something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Eijirou inhaled. \u201cWe talked just a little bit, I think I offended him.\u201d He laughed dryly. \u201cI thought I was going to die right that moment, oh my god. And then, and then, the queen walked over. Guys, the queen!\u201d He buried his face again in his hands, shaking his head in disbelief that had really happened.</p><p>\u201cI panicked and ran. Just straight into the crowd. I wanted to leave but then those nobles came and, hell, I talked my mouth off, guys, I don\u2019t even remember anymore what I was rambling about. But they were laughing, that\u2019s good I guess.\u201d</p><p>Mina chuckled slightly. \u201cLeave it to Eijirou, the humble servant boy making the nobles laugh in the face of his own death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot funny!\u201d Eijirou wailed. \u201cBut then, the prince was there. Just, appeared out of nowhere, grabbed my arm and took me outside. I almost hugged him. I mean, I was so fucking terrified but I was finally outside. And then.\u201d Eijirou stared at the ground, tilting his head in thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2026 sparred?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d Hanta and Mina said in unison.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2026 He took some wooden swords, gave me one and then we fought? I don\u2019t know guys, that was so surreal I don\u2019t even know.\u201d He shrugged helplessly. \u201cFor like half an hour? Then he beat me, obviously, and said something about taking a bath and how filthy we are and that my hair looked almost black.\u201d He gestured vaguely at his hair that was, in fact, back to his original black color.</p><p>\u201cAnd then I bolted. Just straight away. And here I am.\u201d</p><p>Mina huffed out a breath, opening and closing her mouth, changing whatever she wanted to say every second.</p><p>\u201cAt least he doesn\u2019t know who you really are.\u201d Hanta said with a shrug. \u201cCould be worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorse? I insulted the prince and fought with him on equal terms! As if impersonating a noble wasn\u2019t bad enough, but behaving like that in front of the crown prince? I am a dead man walking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeez, drama queen, relax.\u201d Mina patted his shoulder with a little too much force, making him wince. \u201cI think, that was a successful evening.\u201d She grinned at him.</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d He raised his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cWell, you talked to nobles, ate their food, talked to the prince, who spent time with you alone\u201d, she wiggled her eyebrows at that, \u201cand nobody found out.\u201d She clapped her hands in conclusion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d, Eijirou sighed. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re not wrong. But I won\u2019t do that again. Ever.\u201d He huffed, crossing his arms.</p><p>Denki entered the chambers shortly after that conversation, or at least, tried to since they were all still sitting in front of the door, holding it close. He got a short recap of what transpired, made an equal conclusion as Mina and Eijirou just sighed in defeat. He let them believe, that this was a success but insisted that he won\u2019t do it again. He shoved the strange pot under his bed, hopefully forgetting about it soon enough.</p><p>The first two days were hell. Eijirou was so paranoid, he couldn\u2019t sleep, made simple mistakes at work and was just a total wreck. The third day was a lot better. He finally could sleep a few hours at a time and didn\u2019t jump at anyone who called him. On the fourth day, he accepted that nothing would happen. He was fine.</p><p>He sat in the kitchen on a low wooden stool, helping to peel the potatoes. A tedious, ungrateful work nobody liked doing, but Eijirou liked to rise to the occasion and took on the task. Half of the basket was peeled, half of them not. He craned his neck, rolling his shoulder with a loud crack and started on the next potato when he overheard the two cooks at the oven next to him.</p><p>\u201cAnother banquet next week? What are they thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, man. They decided yesterday and now we have to get all the ingredients in time. I think they don\u2019t understand this fucking job. We can\u2019t just make a list with everything we need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why another one so soon? Aren\u2019t they, like, just for show? Showing off their money and stuff like that?\u201d</p><p>As they spoke, Eijirou listened with half an ear, he didn\u2019t care about another banquet since it didn\u2019t concern him, a servant walked up and filled his tray with snacks. He chimed in without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cI heard it was a request by the prince himself.\u201d The cooks\u2019 head whipped around. \u201cNo kidding. Something about internal affairs or something like that. Strengthening the bond between their juris\u2026 jurisdi\u2026 the different regions within the kingdom.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI think they said something about inviting every noble family from the Chiba region.\u201d</p><p>Eijirou let his knife fall down, clattering loudly on the ground. He blinked and grabbed at it, apologizing under his breath. A cold sweat broke out on his back, his heartbeat increasing.</p><p>\u201cRumors have it he is looking for\u2026\u201d Eijirou slowly looked up to the servant, trying to hear better what he was saying and their eyes met.</p><p>\u201cYou!\u201d The servant inhaled sharply. Eijirou sprung to his feet, grabbed the servant by the collar and yanked him outside. The tray fell to the ground with a loud clatter, probably everyone looked up at the commotion but Eijirou was already out the door, pushing the servant inside a small broom closet. It was big enough for two people, but they still had to stay so close to each other their knees brushed.</p><p>\u201cWhat the-\u201c \u2013 \u201cShhh!\u201d Eijirou covered the servant\u2019s mouth with his hands, frantically shaking his head. The servant gave a slow nod and Eijirou lowered his hand.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, dude! You\u2019re the one\u2026 the one with the prince! You said thanks! I knew it, no noble could be that nice.\u201d He chuckled in disbelief while Eijirou was regretting every life choice he ever made, ticking off every option he had to survive this.</p><p>\u201cDude, chill! I won\u2019t tell on you!\u201d</p><p>Eijirou\u2019s eyes focused back on the other servant. \u201cYou won\u2019t?\u201d He croaked.</p><p>\u201cNo, man. That is just\u2026 wait, what exactly were you doing there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know, something like a bet and it went out of hand and ugh.\u201d Eijirou slapped a hand on his forehead.</p><p>\u201cI think the prince is looking for you.\u201d He bit his lip. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much you hear down here, but the prince and the mysterious red-haired noble are the talks of the castle! Like, everybody saw how you and the prince left together and he came back alone, raging. Geez, I mean, I knew how much a storm he could curse but that was from a higher level.\u201d He crossed his arm, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cAnd now he demanded another banquet, asking specifically for the nobles of the Chiba region, dude, he has it bad for you.\u201d A grin spread on his face and in every other situation he would be overjoyed at the sight of the same row of pointy teeth but right now, his ears were ringing.</p><p>\u201cWh\u2014No! We\u2026 we just\u2014\u201d He shook his head. \u201cWe were just talking and fighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFighting, huh?\u201d The servant wiggled his eyebrows at him. Before Eijirou could interject, the servant held up a hand. \u201cRelax, man. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t tell a single soul, promise. I\u2019m rooting for you, for whatever thing is happening between you and him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe is nothing happe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to, I can be your ears and eyes inside the castle.\u201d He nodded at himself. \u201cI let you know if I overhear more about this occasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2026 No, man, I mean, thanks. Thanks for not telling anybody and all that. But I don\u2019t\u2026 I\u2019m not doing that again.\u201d Eijirou shook his head. \u201cIf anybody else will find out, I\u2019m dead. Like, literally dead.\u201d</p><p>The servant rolled his head from one shoulder to the other and hummed. \u201cI get it.\u201d He nodded. \u201cOkay, I tell you what. Just listen, for now, okay?\u201d Eijirou nodded reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, everybody is talking about it. Like, all the servants that were present and even the personal maids from the prince. Something like he is nicer to them or something. I think, he really likes you. And like every servant has an easier time with him being not his usual grumpy self. So, I\u2019m totally rooting for you.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cMy suggestion is the following: I tell the other servants about you, just the ones who saw you at the banquet. You will attend the next banquet and we\u2019ll help you out. And then you two can live happily ever after. Or just have a nice evening, don\u2019t care. Just think of something that you can\u2019t see him again after that.\u201d</p><p>Eijirou was baffled. That was the most ridiculous, preposterous, ingenious idea if he ever heard one.</p><p>\u201cEveryone would be on board?\u201d His thoughts were running a mile a second. If he could attend one more banquet and somehow make a possible excuse that he won\u2019t come back ever again the prince would have to let this go and he would never live in fear again.</p><p>\u201cOf course! Like I said, we\u2019re rooting for you!\u201d He snapped his fingers right in front of their faces, remembering something. \u201cI\u2019m Tetsutetsu, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEijirou\u201d, Eijirou mumbled perplexed.</p><p>\u201cYou gave him your real name?\u201d Tetsutetsu raised an eyebrow at him but chuckled slightly at first, then louder. Eijirou had to cover his mouth again, shushing him.</p><p>\u201cSorry\u201d, Tetsutetsu whipped a happy tear away. \u201cThis is the best. I like you, man. You have balls.\u201d He nodded again, gripping at Eijirou\u2019s hand. \u201cYou in?\u201d</p><p>Eijirou\u2019s eyes darted around from Tetsutetsu\u2019s face to his hand to his grin. He inhaled deeply, grabbed his hand as tight as possible and nodded. \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><p>As soon as they left the broom closet and Tetsutetsu sprinted back to the kitchen, remembering that he was just in the middle of serving food, Eijirou took to his heels and ran the whole length of the east wing down the same corridor a few days ago and just kicked in the door to Denki\u2019s workplace.</p><p>\u201cWHA&ndash;!\u201d Denki threw the small flask he had in his hand in the air startled and just barely caught it. \u201cWhat in the?!\u201d</p><p>His head whipped around and narrowed his eyes at Eijirou. \u201cDude, don\u2019t make me lose my job by destroying my ingredients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS-sorry.\u201d Eijirou stammered, honestly embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Denki chirped, already forgiving Eijirou. The latter sat down on the other wooden stool, sighing.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t believe this.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThere will be another banquet next week and I\u2019ll be attending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?!\u201d Denki sprung to his feet, hands on Eijirou\u2019s shoulders. A wide grin spreading over his face, he nodded enthusiastically. \u201cKnew you\u2019d come around. How come?\u201d</p><p>Eijirou briefly summarized his conversation with Tetsutetsu and their plan before he took a deep breath and stared at Denki, chewing on his lips. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is probably the worst and best plan I have ever heard!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought!\u201d</p><p>They burst into a small laughing fit, wheezing. Denki held his side, rubbing over his eyes. \u201cOkay, dude, we need to make a plan. We need\u201d, he fumbled over his desk, grabbing for some ink and paper and started scribbling as he spoke, \u201cMina needs to give you some more clothes, you can\u2019t wear the same from last time. We need to gather enough information about other families in Chiba, so you actually play a believing part to be from that jurisdiction. We need to maybe polish your overall appearance a little, like\u201d, he gestured a circle around Eijirou\u2019s face with his quill, \u201cmaybe some powder, new hairstyle.\u201d</p><p>Eijirou couldn\u2019t even close his mouth as Denki spoke. When did his friend became so proactive and even had some really good advice? He shook his head to bring himself back to the moment and then nodded. \u201cY-yeah, sounds good!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you have to learn to speak a little more proper!\u201d Denki actually chided but still grinning. \u201cThough, the prince seemed to like you nonetheless, so\u2026\u201d He trailed off, shrugging. \u201cI don\u2019t really know. Being yourself seemed to be the best course, I guess.\u201d</p><p>The next days were pure stress. Not only because every servant was involved in the preparations for the banquet since it was on such short notice. The chambers had to be prepared for the guests, clothes, tablecloths and draperies had to be washed, food had to be harvested and bought and hunted, dished had to be polished, the floors had to be mopped and so on. It was a little miracle, no one has dropped dead yet.</p><p>When it was only two days until the banquet, they had a little bit f time to breathe. Most of the tasks were fulfilled, there will be another rush the next day but for now, Eijirou could actually work on their other plan.</p><p>Mina had gathered some different garments while washing clothes, slowly piling it up. Eijirou didn\u2019t know how she could get away with it, but he suspected the other wash maiden had heard about his ordeal as well and helped out. In fact, probably everybody had heard about it by now, judging by all the knowing looks he got.</p><p>Tetsutetsu pulled him aside a few times to give an update, but nothing noteworthy has changed. Nobody has heard any other reason for the banquet to be held but the personal maids are still recounting pleasant encounters with the prince.</p><p>So, when Eijirou had the opportunity, he grabbed all the clothes Mina had gathered, shoved the mystical jug into his pocket and sneaked outside, up to the river stream. He knew Mina could help him a lot more but Eijirou wanted to try out some stuff himself. He had relied on his friends so much the last week, he wanted to lift some of their burdens.</p><p>He hid behind the trees next to the river, folded out his clothes and smeared some of the substance into his hair. It was strange how the pot never seemed to become emptier. But who was he to question some magical pot of hair dying substance?</p><p>The next step was to come up with an acceptable outfit with his limited choices and a new hairstyle.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>The two days after the banquet, Bakugou was just furious. Outstandingly furious. He snapped at everything and everyone, making them stay out of his way altogether. It was better for everyone involved. He was outraged, to be just ditched like that. What was Kirishima thinking who he was? He was just a lowly noble, just recently established and then he ditched him, the prince?</p><p>It was both infuriating and humiliating. He knew he wasn\u2019t the most amiable person to ever exist, but he thought that Kirishima didn&rsquo;t mind because, well, he didn\u2019t evade him because of it and could actually hold a conversation without licking the ground he was walking on. It was\u2026 nice. To talk to someone without being held to the standards of a prince, to just be a man.</p><p>Nevertheless, he ditched him. Just after they had the most exciting sparring fight he had in a long time. Did he do something wrong? Did he say something? Did he insult him by kicking him in the mud? It could be all three possibilities.</p><p>After he finally got himself out of his self-pity, Bakugou at first thought about just forgetting about Kirishima. They would probably never meet again. That was okay. He didn\u2019t need him. Then, when he was being dressed by his maids, Bakugou wasn\u2019t sure why but something Kirishima had said popped up in his head, he looked down at the maids, observing their movements, and asked:</p><p>\u201cShould I\u201d, the maids\u2019 heads jerked up in alarm as they heard him growling, \u201cstay differently, so you can reach better?\u201d He was one head and a half taller than them and they often had to stretch to their toes to reach his shoulder or even get a stool to stand on. The next few seconds were filled with silence, nobody moving, until Bakugou\u2019s face moved back into his usual scowl.</p><p>\u201cCould you\u201d, the maid behind his back quietly piped up, \u201chold up your arms, your Highness?\u201d</p><p>The other maids held their breaths, staring at Bakugou to see his reaction. He nodded sharply and held up his arms as he was asked. The maids exchanged some confused looks but didn\u2019t question his behavior. As they dressed him, the other maids started to request some simple posture changings which he did without complaining. Dressing took less time than usual.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He mumbled when they hurried out the room and they made their curtsies with small smiles to their faces. Huh.</p><p>The next day, he paid attention. To the waiting staff, the errand boys, the servants, the gardeners. And, as Kirishima said, no one paid them any mind, not even half a glance. They just did all the work without complaining, not one hurtful glare against someone who bumped into them or dirtied the hallway just a second after it was cleaned. Maybe, just maybe, there was some truth in what Kirishima had said.</p><p>The day after that, he walked inside the chambers of his mother first thing in the morning. He didn\u2019t care that the guards advised against just walking in without announcing himself but he ignored them in Bakugou-fashion. He kicked the door in without knocking, his mother jerking from her bed. His father kept on snoring next to her.</p><p>\u201cMother.\u201d He growled.</p><p>\u201cSon.\u201d His mother slowly rose, glaring at him. \u201cWhat could be so important for my precious son to wake his mother from her well-earned sleep in this manner?\u201d</p><p>Bakugou had to bite back some inappropriate remark, biting his lower lip. \u201cI want you to hold a banquet. For me.\u201d</p><p>Well, that stunned his mother to silence. \u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes, hard. She didn\u2019t have to make such deal out of it. Sure, he never ever asked for a social event he had to attend, especially not in his name.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. A banquet. Like the monthly thing. Just, make it for internal affairs. Reinforcing the friendship between the castle and the jurisdiction of the Chiba prefecture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInternal\u2014Katsuki, who are you?\u201d His mother grinned at him. \u201cOr is this about a certain red-haired man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014No!\u201d Bakugou spat. \u201cWhat the fuck, mom?\u201d He groaned. \u201cI actually act like the prince you always wanted and then you make it about something stupid like that? Just. Do it.\u201d His lips tightened in a straight line. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Mitsuki had to blink a few times to register what her son had just said. She knew when to push and when to just shut up, she was the one who raised him, after all.</p><p>\u201cSure thing, Katsuki.\u201d</p><p>Bakugou nodded and stormed out her sleeping chambers without saying anything else, seething. That took a lot of his energy. The next days were pretty similar to his usual routine. Classes, sparring, dinner, and lunch. However, since he actually paid attention to their personal, he saw the strained faces, the hectic in their movements and the hurried gestures. It probably wasn\u2019t easy to prepare such a huge banquet on such short notice.</p><p>Bakugou actually felt, what audacity his feelings had these days, guilty. Guilty for putting so much pressure on them on top of their usual workload. So, when he happened to overhear some of the servants talking about the menu, what kind of proteins they still needed, he asked them, if it would help if he hunted down a deer.</p><p>The looks he got were always like a punch to his gut. Was it really so strange to ask if they needed help? Well, yeah, he answered himself, he never did in the past 19 years he had lived here. Nor knew he about anybody else who did.</p><p>That was why he now was riding down the cobblestone path behind the castle walls towards the forest, the royal hunting grounds. The bow was fastened at his saddle for now until he arrived at the forest, a quiver on his belt. Even though there was some pressure of time, Bakugou was relieved to get out of the castle again. He steered his horse down from the paved way and rode towards the small river that streamed parallel to the path towards the forest.</p><p>His horse strode leisurely, not stopping but taking its time to walk through the high grass of the riverbed. Bakugou led his view drift into the distance, relaxing for the first time since a few days. A red do next to a cluster of trees drew its attention to him. He squinted and stopped his horse, one hand on the handle of his hunting knife. He silently cursed himself that he didn\u2019t bring his sword, but what good would a sword do at a hunt anyway?</p><p>After observing the red dot for a few seconds, Bakugou noticed it was moving just slightly back and forth to the river and back to the trees. It seemed human alright. With a swift motion, he got off his horse and gestured the horse to stay put. They knew each other for long enough so it understood. Bakugou drew his knife and silently sneaked up to the patch of trees, squatting down to get a better view through the branches. And what a view he got.</p><p>Kirishima only wore his pants, open at the front. His chest was bare, seeing the dark happy trail from the navel down and Bakugou could finally confirm that he was built. Like a wall. His hair was pulled back into a sloppy ponytail, a few strands framing his face. His mouth was pulled in a frown as he grabbed one of the shirts laying on the ground and put it on. Kirishima tucked the shirt in, tugging on it for good measure and walked towards the river to look at his reflection.</p><p>Bakugou felt his face heat up, his heart accelerating its beating. He wasn\u2019t a peeping tom so he put his knife away, stood up straight and cleared his throat.</p><p>Kirishima spun around so fast, he almost lost his footing, stumbling violently before catching himself and leveling his eyes on Bakugou. His cheeks rose in color ever so lightly, but Bakugou decided to ignore it for now.</p><p>\u201cY-Your Highness?\u201d Kirishima croaked, fumbling with his clothes, tugging at his hair, a nervous wreck some would say.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing here?\u201d Bakugou crossed his arms. Even if he was in no position to judge, this was still inside the castle walls, somewhere far away for people to see, so why would Kirishima sneak around to try on his clothes?</p><p>\u201cI- uhm\u201d, Kirishima stammered, slowly walking towards the shirts that were laying on the ground to obscure Bakugou\u2019s view on them, kicking at them with his heel to gather them up. Bakugou raised his eyebrow at that.</p><p>\u201cI was\u2026\u201d, Kirishima looked over his shoulder, biting so hard on his lip Bakugou thought it would draw blood and sighed in defeat. \u201cI was looking for something to wear for the banquet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming?\u201d Bakugou could just hope he didn\u2019t sound as eager as he felt.</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah\u201d, Kirishima shrugged. \u201cYour Highness invited all noble families of the Chiba jurisdiction, would be kinda impolite to not attend, I guess?\u201d The first smile from him finally stretched over his face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn right.\u201d Bakugou scoffed. Then his eyes drove over Kirishima, finally looking at the outfit Kirishima wore. \u201cThat looks fucking hideous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, really?\u201d Kirishima frowned, looking down at himself. \u201cI was pretty confident in this.\u201d Bakugou huffed a small laughter, covering it with a cough. With two big steps, he was right beside Kirishima who looked at him with big eyes. Trying to ignore his gaze on him, Bakugou eyed the different shirts, pants and the two vests. Not exactly the wardrobe of a noble.</p><p>\u201cWhy for fuck\u2019s sake are you dressing up in the middle of the royal castle walls?\u201d He grumbled. There was no heat in his words, he realized that himself already, just curiosity. Kirishima coughed, scratching his neck. He kneeled down to his shirts, pulling at their hems.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u201d, Kirishima bit his lips. Bakugou subconsciously filed it under a nervous tick. \u201cI don\u2019t have that much to choose from.\u201d He silently said, chuckling dryly. It didn\u2019t fit him. \u201cIt\u2019s not much and I have to dress myself. Something Your Highness probably isn\u2019t used to.\u201d A wink at him and Bakugou didn\u2019t know if his cheeks heated up in humiliation or embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d He huffed as he squatted down as well and earned a more earnest chuckle. \u201cAt least I know that this shirt\u201d, he jabbed a finger against Kirishima\u2019s firm chest, \u201cdoesn\u2019t fit your pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the pants are nice, aren\u2019t they?!\u201d Kirishima cried out in mocking despair.</p><p>\u201cThey are.\u201d Bakugou grunted. He pulled at some of the shirts, eyes going back and forth between the shirts and Kirishima&rsquo;s black pants until they settled on a white shirt with a puffy collar and sleeves. He grabbed it and hold it in front of Kirishima who eyed him curiously.</p><p>\u201cPut this on.\u201d He ordered, grabbing for one of the small vests. In the corner of his eye, he could see Kirishima undress before pulling the other shirt over his head. His eyes darted down at his chest for just a second before staring back at the vest in his hands.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Kirishima tugged the hem into his pants, fastening the cords at the frills of his sleeves. Bakugou helped him with his left sleeve and threw the vest in his face. Kirishima chuckled and tucked his arms through the open sleeve holes, butting it up. There were just three buttons, ending just shy under the poof of his collar, accentuating his broad chest just a little more.</p><p>\u201cDo I\u2026 Does it look good?\u201d Kirishima smiled shyly at him, doing things to his gut. Bakugou nodded once before Kirishima trotted over to the water, examining his reflection. Seemingly pleased, he offered Bakugou a wide grin.</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d He beamed at him. Huh, it actually feels nice to hear a thank you for something he did.</p><p>\u201cYou still didn\u2019t answer why the fuck you\u2019re inside the walls.\u201d Bakugou growled. \u201cNobody in his right mind would sneak up inside just to play dress up.\u201d</p><p>Kirishima looked caught, fumbling with his sleeves. His eyes darted around, looking everywhere but at Bakugou.</p><p>\u201cStop stalling. Just fucking tell me.\u201d He snapped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d, Kirishima sighed, \u201cI mean no harm, I promise. I can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t tell you, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Bakugou\u2019s eyes narrowed down at him but couldn\u2019t find any sign that indicated he was lying or wanted to deceive him in any way. He scoffed.</p><p>\u201cSuit your-fucking-self.\u201d</p><p>Kirishima threw him another apologetic smile. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>An awkward silence stretched between them, making both of them uncomfortable. Bakugou glared at the ground, stuffing down the slight pricking feeling in his chest.</p><p>\u201cSo\u201d, Kirishima walked up to him, \u201cwhat are you doing here?\u201d Bakugou threw a glance over his shoulder to see his horse grassing right where he left him.</p><p>\u201cOn my way to hunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Kirishima exclaimed, clapping his hands. \u201cFor the banquet?\u201d He nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnything in particular? Deer? Boar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeer. Probably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm\u201d, Kirishima hummed. \u201cI wonder how it\u2019ll taste?\u201d he mumbled. Bakugou wasn\u2019t sure if it was meant for him to hear but he huffed, nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cLike fucking deer. I don\u2019t think deer tastes differently in other prefectures.\u201d Kirishima threw him an unreadable glance.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m gonna find out anyway, huh?\u201d Kirishima smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cYou want to come with me?\u201d They blinked at each other before Bakugou\u2019s brain caught up with his mouth. He coughed, taking a step back.</p><p>\u201cForget tha\u2014\u201c \u2013 \u201cSure.\u201d They spoke at the same time. Bakugou\u2019s gaze shot up, meeting Kirishima\u2019s, cheeks slightly reddened.</p><p>\u201cAh, but I don\u2019t really know how to hunt, so I won\u2019t be of any help.\u201d Kirishima scratched his cheek. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Bakugou huffed. \u201cI\u2019m more than capable enough. Just don\u2019t scare it away.\u201d He turned around on his heels, not looking if Kirishima followed him, only hearing his footsteps falling in line behind him. He took the reins of his horse again when they reached it and climbed into his saddle again. He stepped out of the stirrup iron on Kirishima\u2019s side and threw him an awaiting glance.</p><p>Kirishima hesitated only for a second, taking a step forward and grabbing the hand Bakugou offered. It was warm. Kirishima put one foot in the stirrup and with a little effort, Bakugou pulled him up. Kirishima slid behind him in his saddle, his back flushed against Kirishima\u2019s chest. He hoped Kirishima wouldn\u2019t notice how hard his heart was hammering in his chest.</p><p>Bakugou steered his horse back on track and silently they rode towards the forest. Kirishima\u2019s breath tickled against his neck, sometimes his ear whenever he turned his head to look around, gasping voiceless at the view or an animal or whatever he deemed interesting. Bakugou tried really hard to focus on his environment, but that proved really hard with Kirishima literally all around him. His breath and voice surrounding his head, his arms pulled lightly around his waist, their torso\u2019s and thighs pressed against each other.</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d Kirishima mumbled softly into his ear. Bakugou could feel the tips of his ears burn, just where he felt Kirishima\u2019s breath. He pointed carefully between two trees and when Bakugou followed his line of sight, he saw a deer, antlers growing high above his head.</p><p>Ever so slowly, Bakugou reached for his bow, stroking over Kirishima\u2019s thigh with the motion, pulling out an arrow with his other hand. His motions were slow but without hesitation, assertive. He drew his arrow, aimed with one eye closed, feeling Kirishima\u2019s chest rising against his back. Their breathing was in synch, he felt Kirishima exhaling by his chest flattening and let go of his arrow.</p><p>The arrowhead shot through the branches right above the deer\u2019s front legs through his ribs, killing it instantly. Kirishima gasped again.</p><p>\u201cAmazing.\u201d His grip tightened around Bakugou\u2019s waist.</p><p>\u201cI fucking know\u201d, he grumbled more out of reflex. He fastened his bow back on the saddle and galloped over to their prey. He slid down from the saddle, landing on the ground with a soft thud and kneed down. Pulling out his knife, he heard Kirishima land behind him, and slit his knife through the deer\u2019s throat to let it bleed out.</p><p>\u201cWe let it bleed out and then the kitchen staff will take care of the rest.\u201d He explained without being asked to, seeing Kirishima nod next to him.</p><p>\u201cYou never skin and gut it yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No. It\u2019s all dirty and gross.\u201d</p><p>Kirishima laughed airily. \u201cWell, I think, if you want to eat something you have to go through the whole process.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you never fucking hunted yourself. So, you don\u2019t actually deserve to eat deer yourself.\u201d Bakugou shot back. Kirishima didn\u2019t say anything, just held his hand open for the knife. Groaning at himself, finally catching up what was going on, he handed Kirishima the knife. For someone who was praised to be a genius he sometimes was a little dense.</p><p>\u201cYou never ate deer before.\u201d He answered himself quietly. Kirishima hummed and began to hold up the knife before stopping.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d Bakugou rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cMy clothes!\u201d Kirishima put the knife down and stripped off his vest and shirt with deft fingers. His skin was slightly flushed as he kneeled back down, grabbing for the knife again. He set the knife at the bottom of the deer\u2019s throat, Bakugou could see Kirishima\u2019s muscles tense up as he pulled the knife from left to right in one firm stroke.</p><p>Immediately, all innards fell out. Fortunately, it already bled out enough from its throat so not too much blood came out through the cut. Kirishima wiped the Knife on the grass to get the excess blood off from it and then grabbed at intestines and stomach and whatnot. He just grabbed it with his bare hands. Bakugou stared at him as if he wasn\u2019t human.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026 you just do that?\u201d</p><p>Kirishima blinked at him. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause\u2014\u201d Bakugou stopped himself. Because it\u2019s the servants\u2019 job, was what he wanted to say but knowing Kirishima well enough, he would insult him with this thinking. He nodded, took a deep breath and watched Kirishima gutting the deer. After a short while, Kirishima began to explain what he was doing. He couldn\u2019t name much of the anatomy of the deer, Bakugou filled these blanks, but had extensive knowledge about the right procedure to prepare a deer to be cooked.</p><p>It took them about half an hour to get all its intestines properly wrapped up, another half an hour to skin it, and then strapped the deer on the back of Bakugou\u2019s horse. They opted to walk beside the horse, Kirishima said to have an eye on the deer so it wouldn\u2019t slide down but Bakugou understood that he didn\u2019t want to strain his horse too much with two grown men and a deer on its back. No way, he would ride then.</p><p>Bakugou had taken Kirishima\u2019s clothes and held onto it for now since Kirishima\u2019s arms were still dipped in blood right up to his elbows. After exiting the forest, Bakugou steered them back to the river and Kirishima could wash his arms. When he emerged from the water and strutted over to him, asking silently for his clothes, Bakugou had to force himself to give it back to him, he had to admit.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Ba- Your Highness.\u201d Kirishima snapped his eyes to the ground as he stumbled over his words, pulling the shirt over his head. Bakugou squinted his eyes at him but let it slide. He crossed his arms and waited.</p><p>\u201cNo, really, thank you.\u201d Kirishima said again. \u201cFor, you know, taking me with you and\u201d, he gestured at himself, \u201chelping me out.\u201d</p><p>Bakugou huffed and pulled himself back into the saddle. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>Kirishima beamed at him. \u201cSee you at the banquet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better will.\u201d He steered his horse back to the cobbled path, hitting its flanks with his heels and galloped back to the castle before he could look back.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Eijirou stood at the river as long as he could see the prince ride away. At the same time, he wished for Bakugou to turn around and to just ride away as fast as he could. Bakugou took the decision from him as he galloped away. He let out a breath he didn\u2019t know he held in.</p><p>He squatted down, hands to his face a made a noise between a squeal and a giggle. No, this couldn\u2019t be happening. No. Nope. Eijirou walked up to the patch of trees, grabbed all the clothes and, finally, ran all the way back. He already took long enough as it was. He ignored all the looks he got and was relieved he could say his red face was because of the running.</p><p>He slid into his chamber and stuffed the clothes under his bed, changing out of his current outfit. He put on his simple linen clothing, pulled his headband around his red hair and ran all the way back to the kitchen and asked for something, anything to do. He needed to be distracted.</p><p>After tackling every possible assignment, Eijirou made his way back to their chambers when it was already late. He stumbled into the room, trying to be as quiet as possible but as soon as the door swung open, his friends were on their feet, lighting a candle.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?!\u201d They all whispered loudly in unison.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Kirishima stuttered. His brain provided him instantly with his memories of today\u2019s afternoon, Bakugou\u2019s eyes constantly roaming over his own naked chest, his body pressed against him, brushing against each other with every step the horse had taken. His face flushed unbelievable hot.</p><p>\u201cYou met the prince, haven\u2019t you?\u201d Mina gave him a knowing look, receiving nothing but a nod in confirmation. His friends high fived each other.</p><p>\u201cGuys\u201d, Eijirou whined, \u201cthat\u2019s not something to celebrate. I will only meet him once again and then never again. This just makes everything\u201d, he huffed in annoyance, \u201cmore complicated.\u201d</p><p>His friends followed him with his eyes as he prepared for bed, exchanging glanced.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Denki asked.</p><p>Eijirou\u2019s shoulders tensed before falling down. \u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s talk hypothetically.\u201d He sat down on his bed, his friends following suit. \u201cHypothetically, I like him. And he liked me. We met at the banquet, becoming even better friends. Yeah, well, surprise I have to move to another country, so see you never again.\u201d He groaned. \u201cThis will just\u2026 suck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if you just, I don\u2019t know, play along for a little longer?\u201d Mina asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cDeceiving him? Playing someone, I am not? Yeah, great. And either it will suck even more when we have to stop seeing each other or he\u2019ll find out eventually and take it upon himself to stab me to death. I don\u2019t want to\u2026\u201d, he clenched his jaw, \u201cI don\u2019t want to lie to him anymore. I mean, hypothetically, if I liked him, lying to the person you like is just not right.\u201d Eijirou fell backward onto his pillow, both arms spread to his sides, bumping against the wall with his knuckles.</p><p>\u201cJust two more days.\u201d He mumbled into the almost darkness. His friends stayed silent. There wasn\u2019t anything they could say because deep down, they knew Eijirou was right. There was no possible solution that a prince and a servant could ever be friends, let alone anything else.</p><p>Eijirou tried not to think about the upcoming banquet too hard for the next days but that was kind of impossible since every waking second he was reminded that it was happening due to all the assignments their wing was flooded with. The day before the banquet was especially brutal. Some of the guests had already arrived and demanded attention on top of preparing for the event. Eijirou still was grateful, working and running around at least occupied his brain well enough to actually think about that he would be attending as well.</p><p>Well, until it was finally was the day of the banquet. His thoughts caught up with the impending task at hand and made him jittery. His hands trembled, his mind wandered. What he couldn\u2019t really grasp was, was it just anticipation acting as a noble or did he, as a matter of fact, not want to part ways with the prince? He didn\u2019t know and, to be honest, he didn\u2019t want to know.</p><p>When it was finally time to get ready, all the other servants ushered him out of the kitchen, encouraging to do whatever he wanted, with a wink, that they could handle the rest. With a heavy sigh, he left for his chambers where Mina was already waiting for him.</p><p>\u201cWow, you look like you\u2019re on the way to a funeral.\u201d She smacked his back. \u201cCheer up, you\u2019re gonna see your prince tonight.\u201d She chuckled with a knowing look.</p><p>\u201cHe is not my prince\u201d, he grumbled in response but, oh no, did he want him to be his? Shaking his head, he banished the thought as soon as it came up and pulled out the clothes he prepared for tonight. Mina helped him dress, to give a few knowing tucks so it framed his body just the right way.</p><p>Eijirou had already smeared some of the substance into his air before he went to bed last night, not entirely sure how much time he would have for getting ready. Turned out, enough time.</p><p>\u201cSit\u201d, Mina ushered him to sit on the floor in front of the bed, sitting down behind him. She brushed his hair with a broken comb and started to part his hair. Slowly she started to braid different wisps of hair on the side until it united in the middle of the back of his head and became one thicker braided tail, which was slightly raised with a black bow. The end of the ponytail was fastened with a thin black strand.</p><p>Eijirou carefully drove his hand over his hair, feeling the tight strands and when Mina handed him her mirror, he let out a tiny gasp.</p><p>\u201cMina!\u201d He turned his head from one side to the other, a few shorter strands on his forehead bobbing with the motion, and his smile grew. \u201cThat looks amazing! Thank you!\u201d He turned around fully and pulled her in a firm embrace. Mina laughed into his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not difficult to make a pretty person pretty.\u201d She tightened her hold for a second before they both let go. \u201cEijirou\u201d, she tugged at his frilly collar, stroking over his vest.</p><p>\u201cI want you to know, that we will be on your side. Whatever will happen, whatever your decision will be.\u201d</p><p>Eijirou nodded, trying not to cry on the spot. Mina patted his cheek. \u201cYou still have time to cry. As soon as I\u2019m finished with you I won\u2019t let you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMina!\u201d Eijirou wailed, again, pressing his face into her chest. She patted his hair and hushed him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, took in a deep breath and sat up again. \u201cAlright.\u201d Mina grabbed some of the make-up utensils she could gather over the span of last week with the help of other maids and started to apply some powder on his cheeks, drew a fine line on the wing of his eyelids with charcoal and dabbed some red substance onto his lips, making them even rosier than they were anyway.</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d Mina admired her own work.</p><p>Eijirou took his time to mentally prepare himself, just staring at the wall of their chamber, Mina at his side, holding his hand. They went through the plan often enough he could recite it by heart. In hindsight, he was grateful for Tetsutetsu to get all the other servants on board with this over the top stupid plan. It took some pressure off his shoulder, especially, since the servant who was announcing the guests was as excited as everybody else and could play the part, so he didn\u2019t have to sneak in again. Particularly, because this is an event hosted for his apparent home prefecture and it would seem pretty odd that he had to sneak in for that.</p><p>Come in, eat and drink something, tell Bakugou he needed to leave the country because he was promised some young maiden in a far away state and then leave. Easy enough.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Bakugou was in high spirit in the past few days. High spirit meant, he didn\u2019t snap at everything and some of his heat left his voice, but rarely someone noticed. Still, Bakugou could feel a little change in his mood. Was it because of the little trip with Kirishima? Probably. But he wouldn\u2019t admit to that out loud.</p><p>He noticed a difference in how he was treated by the servants as well as much as he treated them differently. Not that he thanked them for everything they did, it was still their job, but he at least acknowledged their existence, gave them a short nod when, for example, one of them brought him a snack or he saw maids dusting off the busts in the hallway. Which made them a little less\u2026 afraid of him, Bakugou dared to say. He didn\u2019t think it was bad to be afraid of him, it meant respect. But somehow, being asked by his staff if he liked his tea rather with one or two spoons of sugar instead of just needed to be told how he wanted it, felt something akin to trust to him.</p><p>Trust with the people he wanted to lead.</p><p>\u201cDid something good happen, Your Highness?\u201d</p><p>Aizawa pulled him out of thoughts. He didn\u2019t listen for the past few minutes, he assumed. Blinking the thoughts away, Bakugou wore his usual scowl etched on his face.</p><p>\u201cThe fuck you want?\u201d</p><p>Unfazed, Aizawa turned back two pages and sighed. \u201cJust asking. I thought for a second there, you were smiling. Must be a trick of my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn sure it was.\u201d Bakugou snapped but turned his face down to the desk. Just in case. There was no way, such stupid, sappy thoughts would make him smile. Fortunately for him, Aizawa didn\u2019t care much about his current mental state and continued or rather repeated his lecture about the Chiba prefecture. Bakugou was making sure he knew about each and everything of the regions so he could host the best banquet they had ever attended.</p><p>Time flew by, the day filled with his usual routine of lecture, lunch, greeting some of the early guests and getting ready for the banquet. He noticed as the maids dressed him that they were a little more fidgeting, suppressed smiles here and there. He didn\u2019t stoop so low as to ask what was that all about even if his curiosity was stretched to its limit. Instead, he looked at his reflection in the wide mirror, tucking at his collar and sleeves to make himself more comfortable, and thought about someone he might, he better be, meet this evening.</p><p>Kirishima was a mystery to him. Starting by his appearance, what noble did have red hair? And it looked natural, he couldn\u2019t really be at fault but he could try to get some hair masks or whatever, so it wouldn&rsquo;t be that red. But it matched his eye color which was satisfying. And of course, the main reason he was such a mystery was his demeanor toward nobility. There was leisure in his speech, his gestures, his being he wasn\u2019t used to in a noble. Which was refreshing. He felt like talking to a human being and not someone who recited the usual pleasantries. Especially, he felt he could talk to him freely. Because or Kirishima\u2019s leisure he didn\u2019t feel like Kirishima forced himself to speak with him or to kiss his ass, just, he was honest.</p><p>He wanted to know the secrets Kirishima harbored. There was something he didn\u2019t tell him, obviously, and it felt like a challenge. Was he worthy enough to encode this enigma called Kirishima Eijirou?</p><p>His feet brought him to the ballroom, he nodded toward the servants opening the door and received small bows, and entered the room which was slowly filled with attendees. Automatically, his eyes scanned the crowd for a specific redhead but didn\u2019t find anything. He tried to ignore the disappointment in his chest. Taking in a deep breath he made his way to the side of his mother, greeting everyone who stopped him.</p><p>Whenever the door opened, his head jerked up, squinting at the people coming in and whenever it was not a specific red-haired man, his scowl grew deeper.</p><p>\u201cWhat made you so peeved, my dear son?\u201d His mother nudged him with her elbow, pushing it deep between his ribs and he suppressed a wince.</p><p>\u201cShut up. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHum.\u201d She hummed, grin growing a little wider, a little wickeder. \u201cAwaiting someone?\u201d Bakugou narrowed his eyes on her and clicked his tongue.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I? Just waiting for everybody to arrive to eat, I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure, you aren\u2019t thirsty?\u201d</p><p>Bakugou chocked on his own spit and spun around. \u201cMother\u2014\u201d but before he could finish his sentence, the door opened again and his ears heard the quiet announcement.</p><p>\u201cSir Kirishima Eijirou, first and only son of Lady Kirishima Tomoya.\u201d</p><p>Bakugou\u2019s voice died in his throat as he looked up to Kirishima walking through the doors, wearing the outfit he put together for him and an elaborate hairstyle. Maybe it was the chandelier or the lightning overall but to him, it looked like Kirishima was glowing.</p><p>He didn\u2019t hear what his mother said to him, just walking right up to Kirishima who was already getting attention by other bystanders. He pushed through them until he was right in front of him.</p><p>\u201cFinally decided to show up, dumbwhit?\u201d He crossed his arms, taking a quick once over glance at Kirishima before settling on the small smile that appeared on his face.</p><p>\u201cAw, did Your Highness miss me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fucking wish.\u201d His fist shot out against the other\u2019s shoulder earning a small grunt, but it turned into a chuckle. Kirishima rubbed at his shoulder and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNeed \u00a0to work on my reflexes so I can kick you\u2019re a\u2014to win fair and square.\u201d He coughed and scratched his cheek.</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck do you think I care about your wording?\u201d As if caught, Kirishima\u2019s eyes shot open, blinking.</p><p>\u201cUh, I\u2026\u201d, his hand traveled to his neck, rubbing at it, \u201cI mean, you\u2019re still the prince and I\u2019m far beneath you, so\u201d, he shrugged as he trailed off, eyes looking up at him sheepishly. \u201cDo you\u2026 don\u2019t want me to?\u201d</p><p>Bakugou glared at him with a small grunt and shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s whatever. I don\u2019t care.\u201d Kirishima hummed, leaning over a little.</p><p>\u201cThen, Your Highness, please let me kick your ass next time we spar.\u201d Bakugou\u2019s eyes narrowed down on Kirishima\u2019s beaming smile and shoved his shoulder at him.</p><p>\u201cBig words for someone who couldn\u2019t even get one hit in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI almost had you\u2026 that one time, I think.\u201d</p><p>Bakugou chuckled ever so lightly at the contemplating look on Kirishima\u2019s face. \u201cYou and thinking? I highly doubt that.\u201d When their eyes locked, his heart stuttered for just a second when he saw the tiny, yet warm smile meant for him.</p><p>\u201cSo, you do can laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off!\u201d Bakugou shoved at him again but Kirishima was laughing wholeheartedly already.</p><p>For the next hour, they kept on bantering, trying to one-up each other for their next sparring session and walked around the room. Bakugou had to stop every now and then to hold an obliging conversation with which he really could live without. His eyes always trailed off to his side, where Kirishima was apparently glued to him, never really leaving him but not chiming in in the conversation. Afterward, when they were alone again, Bakugou listed off some trivial information of the noble they were talking to. Not to impress Kirishima or anything.</p><p>Then, a small bell was rung, and his mother invited their guests to join her at the dinner table. Bakugou made a face and lead Kirishima to the table, scanning it for Kirishima\u2019s name badge and was pleasantly surprised to find him seated directly at his side. Whoever decided their seating order needed to be thanked. He almost pulled out the chair to offer it to Kirishima but could stop himself in time. Instead, he sat down on his own chair, registering by the movement next to him that Kirishima sat down as well.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what will be served?\u201d Kirishima leaned in and whispered to Bakugou. He just shrugged.</p><p>\u201cProbably the same as always. Soup, fish, meat, dessert.\u201d Pushing his lips up a little higher in a scowl. \u201cAlways the same.\u201d</p><p>Kirishima tilted his head at that. \u201cYou\u2026 don\u2019t like having four different courses?\u201d Bakugou rolled his eyes and groaned.</p><p>\u201cNo, Shitty-shima, I don\u2019t like having the same four courses every damn day. I thought we have top chefs who like to experiment and give us something to look forward to and not this bland shit, every day.\u201d</p><p>His mother cleared her throat and shot him a meaningful glare which he answered in the same manner. She rolled her eyes and stood up, all conversations died down.</p><p>\u201cMy honored guests, it is my pleasure to welcome you at our home.\u201d She raised her glass. \u201cIt is not only a joy for me to see you come from a faraway place to strengthen our bonds but, as well, that my son takes it upon himself to fight for these bonds.\u201d</p><p>He scuffed under his breath but Kirishima nudged his knee under the table, nodding at him with a smile.</p><p>\u201cSo, thank you, my dear son, Katsuki, to present us this opportunity. Would you like to say something yourself to our guests?\u201d</p><p>\u2018No\u2019 was the first thing he wanted to say but clenched his jaw to not blurt it out. His eyes found Kirishima\u2019s and he sighed. He stood up with a glass in his hand, looking them all over once.</p><p>\u201cThank you for following my invitation when I reached out for you. It is a great honor to have you all assembled in these halls and I hope to nourish our relationship with newly found friends and allies.\u201d His expression turned a little sour. He hated speaking as if he had a stick up his ass. \u201cThen, let\u2019s toast to our friends and eat to our heart\u2019s desire, I\u2019m fucking starving.\u201d He down his glass and sat down.</p><p>Kirishima was the first to break the stunned silence with a laugh and the others followed suit. Pleased by himself, Bakugou gave his mother a courteous nod who in turn fixed him with a knowing look in her eyes, dancing between him and Kirishima. He chose to ignore that and turned his attention back to Kirishima who was beaming at the soup that was brought in.</p><p>\u201cThat looks delicious!\u201d He gasped as a bowl was put in front of him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fucking soup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, Your Highness, even \u2018fucking soup\u2019 can taste pretty good!\u201d Kirishima mimicked his words with the same grumpy expression, Bakugou assumed he was wearing right now and kicked Kirishima under the table, earning a snicker.</p><p>It was fascinating to watch Kirishima eat a simple potato soup as if it was some blessed meal. His face beamed with every spoonful, humming every other bite and when he wiped his bowl clean with the slice of bread, it was pure bliss on his face. It was fucking soup. And yet, it made Bakugou enjoy his own soup a little more, admitting that it, in fact, did taste pretty good.</p><p>When the fish was served, Bakugou witnessed a rather peculiar situation. He was just quipping back in forth with his parents, when he out of the corner of his eye saw that Kirishima was grabbing for the wrong knife regarding eating fish. When he was about to say something, Kirishima locked eyes with the servant on the other side of the table. They shook their head so lightly, it was only visible if you look for it. Kirishima then moved his hand to the next, another shake and when he touched the right knife, he got a nod. They exchanged a subtle smile and the servant was gone.</p><p>As if nothing had happened, Kirishima turned back to Bakugou, grinning at him.</p><p>\u201cDo you know which fish will be served?\u201d</p><p>Still a little dumbfounded what he just witnessed, Bakugou shook his head. \u201cFish.\u201d He deadpanned. Kirishima chuckled at him.</p><p>\u201cI sure hope it is fish since it is the fish course. Man\u201d, his eyes grew distant, \u201cif that\u2019s all it takes to be a prince, I have a pretty good chance to become one myself.\u201d</p><p>That earned him, at the same time, a hard kick under the table and a chuckle from the queen. Kirishima\u2019s quiet yelp was accompanied by his flashing cheeks as he shot a glance towards the queen. A shy smile formed on his lips.</p><p>\u201cThis is Sir Kirishima Eijirou from whom I\u2019ve heard a lot recently, isn\u2019t he?\u201d The queen asked between bites.</p><p>\u201cY-yes, Your Majesty.\u201d Kirishima bowed his head slightly and Bakugou could see him fumble, apparently undecided if he was allowed to continue eating or waiting for some conversation. He rolled his eyes and nudged his knee, nodding at his fish. Relief washed over Kirishima as he took the next bite.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen Katsuki hold such a long conversation in a long time without chasing the other party away. What\u2019s your secret?\u201d</p><p>Kirishima snorted slightly but shook his head. \u201cNo secret, Your Majesty. Just honest\u2026 I like the way he is.\u201d Another smile, almost fond, formed on his lips and a bit of fish fell from Bakugou\u2019s fork as he stopped it right before his mouth. Ignoring the heat forming on his cheeks he bit down hard on his fork.</p><p>His mother just laughed. \u201cOh, dear Sir, that is truly fascinating. Do tell, what is it you like about my son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother!\u201d Bakugou almost shouted, heads turning to see what the commotion was about. Bakugou glared at his mother, having a silent conversation with his eyes alone. Which Mitsuki choose to ignore.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Katsuki? I just thought it was nice to know about redeeming qualities you have I\u2019m not aware of.\u201d Her smile stretched on his face, every inch of it smug.</p><p>\u201cOh, is it so hard to believe someone likes the son you raised? That is really reassuring.\u201d Bakugou snapped with fake hurt, lashing his anger out on his fish. The queen waited for another second before bursting out in a fit of laughter, dispersing the heavy atmosphere that had formed. Bakugou grumbled.</p><p>Kirishima touched his elbow with his own, searching for his eyes. He glanced over, pursing his lips. Slightly leaning forward, Kirishima held their gaze and whispered.</p><p>\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I like how determined you are, among other things.\u201d He had the audacity to wink at him. Bakugou felt another wave of heat rising up his face but also in his chest, tightening around his lungs. He grunted in response.</p><p>When they were finished with the fish, Kirishima leaned over again. His eyes were cast down, his fingers twitching at his napkin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014Can we talk after dinner? There is something I have to tell you.\u201d</p><p>Bakugou\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhy not tell me fucking now?\u201d</p><p>Kirishima shook his head, a sad smile on his lips he didn\u2019t like one bit. \u201cWe should talk\u2026 in private.\u201d Bakugou rolled his eyes but nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Whatever, indeed. It wasn\u2019t important that his heart clenched by the sorrowful look Kirishima wore or that he held his breath when he thought about what Kirishima had to tell him in private.</p><p>When the meat course was served, his mother raised her glass again. \u201cI want to thank my son since he was the one who shot the deer for us today.\u201d</p><p>Quiet \u2018oh\u2019s and \u2018ah\u2019s were uttered.</p><p>\u201cKirishima helped.\u201d Bakugou grumbled. His mother raised her eyebrows, tilting her head.</p><p>\u201cOh? I wasn\u2019t aware of that. Of course, thank you, Sir Kirishima, as well. How come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Kirishima\u2019s eyes widened and Bakugou saw him looking over to him in search for help.</p><p>\u201cWe just kinda ran into each other. And since I was on my way I just invited him to tag along. He was the one who\u2014\u201d Kirishima stepped on his foot and shook his head almost undetectable. Bakugou stumbled a little over his words and glared at him.</p><p>\u201cWe both took it down.\u201d He said in the end. His mother nodded again, forming polite conversation with the person next to his father, throwing Bakugou a meaningful look. But Bakugou had already turned his head to Kirishima.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck was that about?\u201d He hissed. Kirishima shrugged at him noncommittally.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want people to know.\u201d It was rather formed a question as he raised his voice at the end. Bakugou pinched his nose with two fingers, taking a few deep breaths. Why in the world was he keeping up with this? There was no logical reason and he was well aware of that fact, making it even more frustrating to him. Glancing back to Kirishima and seeing him savoring the meat, however, he decided it didn\u2019t matter really that much that he knew why.</p><p>\u201cAre all banquets like that?\u201d Kirishima asked in between bites.</p><p>Bakugou finally started eating as well. \u201cMostly. It\u2019s literally a banquet, dumbass.\u201d He scowled at Kirishima\u2019s chuckle. \u201cSometimes there are dances, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDances?\u201d Kirishima beamed at him. \u201cAw, man, that would have been great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, you like dances?\u201d Bakugou perked one eyebrow up. \u201cDon\u2019t look like one to dance.\u201d</p><p>Kirishima shrugged. \u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t actually. I mean, I don\u2019t know how\u201d, lowering his voice Kirishima poked at his meat, \u201cbut I wanted to attend a formal dance for so long, you know. Preferable after I learned how to dance.\u201d Another chuckle.</p><p>Bakugou eyed him for a second, an idea forming inside his head and before he could stop himself, he said: \u201cI could teach you.\u201d</p><p>Kirishima\u2019s head jerked up, staring at him with glistening eyes. \u201cYou would?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIdiot\u201d, Bakugou cleared his throat, chewing the rest of his meat in his mouth, \u201cthat\u2019s what I said, didn\u2019t I?\u201d He fixed his eyes back on the plate since he couldn\u2019t bear looking further at Kirishima\u2019s blinding smile. A few seconds went by without Kirishima answering so he chanced another glance.</p><p>Kirishima separated the vegetables from his meat with his fork, poking at it absentmindedly. His smile was already dropped and Bakugou felt his chest tighten, again. Should he see his physician about this?</p><p>\u201cGot a problem with that?\u201d he snapped instead.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Kirishima blinked up at him. \u201cNo! No, not at all. It\u2019s just\u2026\u201d he bit his lip, avoiding his gaze. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you later, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with all that\u2014\u201d \u2013 \u201cSo, Sir Kirishima\u201d, his mother interrupted him mid-sentence and he had to count from 10 backward to no yell at her.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t your mother come to join us today? I would have thought, she would be delighted as a recently declared Lady?\u201d She took a long sip, fixing Kirishima in his seat with her eyes.</p><p>\u201cY-yes, Your Majesty.\u201d Kirishima voice sounded raspy. \u201cShe extends her thanks for the invitation, however, she couldn\u2019t make it because of her health.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear. I hope she will get better soon.\u201d Bakugou\u2019s mother held a hand to her chest, shaking her head. \u201cI hope she can join us for the next banquet. I\u2019d like to meet the woman who raised such a good boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo see how it\u2019s actually done?\u201d Bakugou finally quipped. He wasn\u2019t to let it slide that she kept interrupting him and made a fool out of him. His mother shot him a glare.</p><p>\u201cFor you to see how to treat a mother right, my dear son.\u201d</p><p>He heard Kirishima stifle a laugh next to him, so he jerked his head around. \u201cYou fucker like laughing about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no\u201d, he grinned, holding a hand up in front of his mouth, \u201cit\u2019s just\u2026 I\u2019m happy to see you\u2019re having such a good relationship with your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWha\u2014Where did you get that idea from?!\u201d Bakugou blinked at him incredulously. Kirishima leaned back against his chair, humming.</p><p>\u201cWell, you can only really banter like this with someone you actually care about, don\u2019t you?\u201d A fond smile spread over his face. Did he wear make-up? Bakugou noticed the thin black line on his eyelid, giving his eyes a more edged shape. And before, he thought Kirishima looked a little pale, but now he saw the rosy cheeks shimmer through the face powder.</p><p>He grabbed his glass and took a long sip, whipping the excess wine away with the back of his hand.</p><p>\u201cMy old hag and I aren\u2019t\u2014\u201d he couldn\u2019t finish his sentence, as the giant clock on the wall struck 12, the first bell ringing through the hall. Rolling his eyes, Bakugou waited for the next beat to continue but he noticed Kirishima freezing up beside him, his eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already midnight?\u201d he barely breathed.</p><p>\u201cHuh? Yeah. We started dinner rather late because of those stupid late runners.\u201d He shrugged and picked up the last piece of meat with his fork.</p><p>\u201cI have to go.\u201d Kirishima almost threw down his cutlery, standing up with a screeching chair. Bakugou almost choked on his own spit and whipped his head around.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d He snapped. But Kirishima had already pushed the chair back far enough and took a step back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I am so, so sorry. I need to go. See you later, Baku\u2014Your Highness!\u201d And with that, he jolted around and started running. Bakugou wheezed. Not again. Kirishima would not ditch him again. With a sharp push, he stood up from his chair, on foot already planted firmly on the ground to give him leverage. He thrust forward only to collide with a servant who suddenly appeared from the side.</p><p>Bakugou toppled over with the person but could retain from falling down by rolling over his shoulder. The tray flew high up, falling down with a loud clatter, and dishes shattering on the ground. The servant held his side but was already kneeling down on both knees, head almost touching the ground.</p><p>\u201cI am incredibly sorry. Please, forgive me, Your Highness.\u201d Their voice quivered slightly and Bakugou clicked his tongue, growling under his breath. He punched the ground with his fist, flinching just barely at the pain.</p><p>Kirishima was gone. Fucking again.</p>",

That screams for stupid ideas. <br><b>A/N:</b> Collection of works for KiriBakuWeek 2019. First time writing KiriBaku, they deserve so much love. Ha.<br></p><p>You can read chapter 2 on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/18557164/chapters/44032582\" target=\"_blank\">AO3</a> if you want to! :)</p>[[MORE]]<p>In record time, Eijirou thought he never ran this fast, he sprinted down the small space between the barracks and the castle walls, shot through the next door inside the east wing and ran towards the servants\u2019 sleeping chambers. Fortunately for him, most servants were either occupied by the still ongoing banquet or were already in their rooms.</p><p>When he arrived at his door, he jerked it open and closed it immediately after he entered, leaning against the cold wood and catching his breath. His heart was still pounding against his rib cage, he thought it would crack through the bones.</p><p>\u201cEijirou!\u201d Mina jumped to her feet followed by Hanta, Denki nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Eijirou slowly slid down the door, huffing out a small whimper and buried his face in his knees. His friends were by his side right then, grabbing his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cW-what happen? You were gone for so long!\u201d Mina cried out, voice cracking with emotion.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re covered in dirt, what the hell?\u201d Hanta examined his attire, dusting off the slowly drying mud from his arms and shins.</p><p>\u201cSo many people\u2026 questions\u2026 prince\u2026 swords\u2026\u201d Eijirou pressed between tight lips. He grasped at his hair, groaning.</p><p>\u201cWhat?! Slow down, what happened?!\u201d Mina, slowly losing her patience, shook a little more insistent at his shoulder. Eijirou groaned again, trying to order his thoughts himself. Hanta, an angel in disguise, held Mina\u2019s arm and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cLet the man breathe, he just needs a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we don\u2019t have a minute!\u201d Mina countered. \u201cEijirou, are you being followed? Did the prince send someone after you?\u201d Eijirou shook his head against his knees and only then Mina allowed herself to calm down. She let go of his shoulder and sat down next to him, Hanta following her example, all three with their backs against the door.</p><p>Eijirou drew his breaths in and out, slowly regaining control of his emotions. He let go of his hair and leaned his head against the door, blinking at the ceiling as if he just realized where he was.</p><p>\u201cThere were-\u201c, his voice broke and he had to clear his throat, \u201cthere were so many people, asking me all this stuff we thought up in advance and at first everything was fine. I just wanted to eat something and then leave, that would be enough. I was so afraid some of the servants would recognize me.\u201d He groaned again just imagining that.</p><p>\u201cAnd then\u201d, he blinked, swallowing, \u201cthe prince was there. I was introduced. To the prince. As a noble. To the prince. Guys, I talked to the prince! The prince of this very kingdom. Me!\u201d His eyes sprung back and forth between Mina and Hanta, growing more and more erratic as he spoke.</p><p>Hanta put a hand on his shoulder to calm him down. \u201cDid he notice something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Eijirou inhaled. \u201cWe talked just a little bit, I think I offended him.\u201d He laughed dryly. \u201cI thought I was going to die right that moment, oh my god. And then, and then, the queen walked over. Guys, the queen!\u201d He buried his face again in his hands, shaking his head in disbelief that had really happened.</p><p>\u201cI panicked and ran. Just straight into the crowd. I wanted to leave but then those nobles came and, hell, I talked my mouth off, guys, I don\u2019t even remember anymore what I was rambling about. But they were laughing, that\u2019s good I guess.\u201d</p><p>Mina chuckled slightly. \u201cLeave it to Eijirou, the humble servant boy making the nobles laugh in the face of his own death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot funny!\u201d Eijirou wailed. \u201cBut then, the prince was there. Just, appeared out of nowhere, grabbed my arm and took me outside. I almost hugged him. I mean, I was so fucking terrified but I was finally outside. And then.\u201d Eijirou stared at the ground, tilting his head in thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2026 sparred?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d Hanta and Mina said in unison.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2026 He took some wooden swords, gave me one and then we fought? I don\u2019t know guys, that was so surreal I don\u2019t even know.\u201d He shrugged helplessly. \u201cFor like half an hour? Then he beat me, obviously, and said something about taking a bath and how filthy we are and that my hair looked almost black.\u201d He gestured vaguely at his hair that was, in fact, back to his original black color.</p><p>\u201cAnd then I bolted. Just straight away. And here I am.\u201d</p><p>Mina huffed out a breath, opening and closing her mouth, changing whatever she wanted to say every second.</p><p>\u201cAt least he doesn\u2019t know who you really are.\u201d Hanta said with a shrug. \u201cCould be worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorse? I insulted the prince and fought with him on equal terms! As if impersonating a noble wasn\u2019t bad enough, but behaving like that in front of the crown prince? I am a dead man walking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeez, drama queen, relax.\u201d Mina patted his shoulder with a little too much force, making him wince. \u201cI think, that was a successful evening.\u201d She grinned at him.</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d He raised his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cWell, you talked to nobles, ate their food, talked to the prince, who spent time with you alone\u201d, she wiggled her eyebrows at that, \u201cand nobody found out.\u201d She clapped her hands in conclusion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d, Eijirou sighed. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re not wrong. But I won\u2019t do that again. Ever.\u201d He huffed, crossing his arms.</p><p>Denki entered the chambers shortly after that conversation, or at least, tried to since they were all still sitting in front of the door, holding it close. He got a short recap of what transpired, made an equal conclusion as Mina and Eijirou just sighed in defeat. He let them believe, that this was a success but insisted that he won\u2019t do it again. He shoved the strange pot under his bed, hopefully forgetting about it soon enough.</p><p>The first two days were hell. Eijirou was so paranoid, he couldn\u2019t sleep, made simple mistakes at work and was just a total wreck. The third day was a lot better. He finally could sleep a few hours at a time and didn\u2019t jump at anyone who called him. On the fourth day, he accepted that nothing would happen. He was fine.</p><p>He sat in the kitchen on a low wooden stool, helping to peel the potatoes. A tedious, ungrateful work nobody liked doing, but Eijirou liked to rise to the occasion and took on the task. Half of the basket was peeled, half of them not. He craned his neck, rolling his shoulder with a loud crack and started on the next potato when he overheard the two cooks at the oven next to him.</p><p>\u201cAnother banquet next week? What are they thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, man. They decided yesterday and now we have to get all the ingredients in time. I think they don\u2019t understand this fucking job. We can\u2019t just make a list with everything we need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why another one so soon? Aren\u2019t they, like, just for show? Showing off their money and stuff like that?\u201d</p><p>As they spoke, Eijirou listened with half an ear, he didn\u2019t care about another banquet since it didn\u2019t concern him, a servant walked up and filled his tray with snacks. He chimed in without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cI heard it was a request by the prince himself.\u201d The cooks\u2019 head whipped around. \u201cNo kidding. Something about internal affairs or something like that. Strengthening the bond between their juris\u2026 jurisdi\u2026 the different regions within the kingdom.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI think they said something about inviting every noble family from the Chiba region.\u201d</p><p>Eijirou let his knife fall down, clattering loudly on the ground. He blinked and grabbed at it, apologizing under his breath. A cold sweat broke out on his back, his heartbeat increasing.</p><p>\u201cRumors have it he is looking for\u2026\u201d Eijirou slowly looked up to the servant, trying to hear better what he was saying and their eyes met.</p><p>\u201cYou!\u201d The servant inhaled sharply. Eijirou sprung to his feet, grabbed the servant by the collar and yanked him outside. The tray fell to the ground with a loud clatter, probably everyone looked up at the commotion but Eijirou was already out the door, pushing the servant inside a small broom closet. It was big enough for two people, but they still had to stay so close to each other their knees brushed.</p><p>\u201cWhat the-\u201c \u2013 \u201cShhh!\u201d Eijirou covered the servant\u2019s mouth with his hands, frantically shaking his head. The servant gave a slow nod and Eijirou lowered his hand.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, dude! You\u2019re the one\u2026 the one with the prince! You said thanks! I knew it, no noble could be that nice.\u201d He chuckled in disbelief while Eijirou was regretting every life choice he ever made, ticking off every option he had to survive this.</p><p>\u201cDude, chill! I won\u2019t tell on you!\u201d</p><p>Eijirou\u2019s eyes focused back on the other servant. \u201cYou won\u2019t?\u201d He croaked.</p><p>\u201cNo, man. That is just\u2026 wait, what exactly were you doing there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know, something like a bet and it went out of hand and ugh.\u201d Eijirou slapped a hand on his forehead.</p><p>\u201cI think the prince is looking for you.\u201d He bit his lip. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much you hear down here, but the prince and the mysterious red-haired noble are the talks of the castle! Like, everybody saw how you and the prince left together and he came back alone, raging. Geez, I mean, I knew how much a storm he could curse but that was from a higher level.\u201d He crossed his arm, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cAnd now he demanded another banquet, asking specifically for the nobles of the Chiba region, dude, he has it bad for you.\u201d A grin spread on his face and in every other situation he would be overjoyed at the sight of the same row of pointy teeth but right now, his ears were ringing.</p><p>\u201cWh\u2014No! We\u2026 we just\u2014\u201d He shook his head. \u201cWe were just talking and fighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFighting, huh?\u201d The servant wiggled his eyebrows at him. Before Eijirou could interject, the servant held up a hand. \u201cRelax, man. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t tell a single soul, promise. I\u2019m rooting for you, for whatever thing is happening between you and him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe is nothing happe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to, I can be your ears and eyes inside the castle.\u201d He nodded at himself. \u201cI let you know if I overhear more about this occasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2026 No, man, I mean, thanks. Thanks for not telling anybody and all that. But I don\u2019t\u2026 I\u2019m not doing that again.\u201d Eijirou shook his head. \u201cIf anybody else will find out, I\u2019m dead. Like, literally dead.\u201d</p><p>The servant rolled his head from one shoulder to the other and hummed. \u201cI get it.\u201d He nodded. \u201cOkay, I tell you what. Just listen, for now, okay?\u201d Eijirou nodded reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, everybody is talking about it. Like, all the servants that were present and even the personal maids from the prince. Something like he is nicer to them or something. I think, he really likes you. And like every servant has an easier time with him being not his usual grumpy self. So, I\u2019m totally rooting for you.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cMy suggestion is the following: I tell the other servants about you, just the ones who saw you at the banquet. You will attend the next banquet and we\u2019ll help you out. And then you two can live happily ever after. Or just have a nice evening, don\u2019t care. Just think of something that you can\u2019t see him again after that.\u201d</p><p>Eijirou was baffled. That was the most ridiculous, preposterous, ingenious idea if he ever heard one.</p><p>\u201cEveryone would be on board?\u201d His thoughts were running a mile a second. If he could attend one more banquet and somehow make a possible excuse that he won\u2019t come back ever again the prince would have to let this go and he would never live in fear again.</p><p>\u201cOf course! Like I said, we\u2019re rooting for you!\u201d He snapped his fingers right in front of their faces, remembering something. \u201cI\u2019m Tetsutetsu, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEijirou\u201d, Eijirou mumbled perplexed.</p><p>\u201cYou gave him your real name?\u201d Tetsutetsu raised an eyebrow at him but chuckled slightly at first, then louder. Eijirou had to cover his mouth again, shushing him.</p><p>\u201cSorry\u201d, Tetsutetsu whipped a happy tear away. \u201cThis is the best. I like you, man. You have balls.\u201d He nodded again, gripping at Eijirou\u2019s hand. \u201cYou in?\u201d</p><p>Eijirou\u2019s eyes darted around from Tetsutetsu\u2019s face to his hand to his grin. He inhaled deeply, grabbed his hand as tight as possible and nodded. \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><p>As soon as they left the broom closet and Tetsutetsu sprinted back to the kitchen, remembering that he was just in the middle of serving food, Eijirou took to his heels and ran the whole length of the east wing down the same corridor a few days ago and just kicked in the door to Denki\u2019s workplace.</p><p>\u201cWHA\u2013!\u201d Denki threw the small flask he had in his hand in the air startled and just barely caught it. \u201cWhat in the?!\u201d</p><p>His head whipped around and narrowed his eyes at Eijirou. \u201cDude, don\u2019t make me lose my job by destroying my ingredients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS-sorry.\u201d Eijirou stammered, honestly embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Denki chirped, already forgiving Eijirou. The latter sat down on the other wooden stool, sighing.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t believe this.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThere will be another banquet next week and I\u2019ll be attending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?!\u201d Denki sprung to his feet, hands on Eijirou\u2019s shoulders. A wide grin spreading over his face, he nodded enthusiastically. \u201cKnew you\u2019d come around. How come?\u201d</p><p>Eijirou briefly summarized his conversation with Tetsutetsu and their plan before he took a deep breath and stared at Denki, chewing on his lips. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is probably the worst and best plan I have ever heard!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought!\u201d</p><p>They burst into a small laughing fit, wheezing. Denki held his side, rubbing over his eyes. \u201cOkay, dude, we need to make a plan. We need\u201d, he fumbled over his desk, grabbing for some ink and paper and started scribbling as he spoke, \u201cMina needs to give you some more clothes, you can\u2019t wear the same from last time. We need to gather enough information about other families in Chiba, so you actually play a believing part to be from that jurisdiction. We need to maybe polish your overall appearance a little, like\u201d, he gestured a circle around Eijirou\u2019s face with his quill, \u201cmaybe some powder, new hairstyle.\u201d</p><p>Eijirou couldn\u2019t even close his mouth as Denki spoke. When did his friend became so proactive and even had some really good advice? He shook his head to bring himself back to the moment and then nodded. \u201cY-yeah, sounds good!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you have to learn to speak a little more proper!\u201d Denki actually chided but still grinning. \u201cThough, the prince seemed to like you nonetheless, so\u2026\u201d He trailed off, shrugging. \u201cI don\u2019t really know. Being yourself seemed to be the best course, I guess.\u201d</p><p>The next days were pure stress. Not only because every servant was involved in the preparations for the banquet since it was on such short notice. The chambers had to be prepared for the guests, clothes, tablecloths and draperies had to be washed, food had to be harvested and bought and hunted, dished had to be polished, the floors had to be mopped and so on. It was a little miracle, no one has dropped dead yet.</p><p>When it was only two days until the banquet, they had a little bit f time to breathe. Most of the tasks were fulfilled, there will be another rush the next day but for now, Eijirou could actually work on their other plan.</p><p>Mina had gathered some different garments while washing clothes, slowly piling it up. Eijirou didn\u2019t know how she could get away with it, but he suspected the other wash maiden had heard about his ordeal as well and helped out. In fact, probably everybody had heard about it by now, judging by all the knowing looks he got.</p><p>Tetsutetsu pulled him aside a few times to give an update, but nothing noteworthy has changed. Nobody has heard any other reason for the banquet to be held but the personal maids are still recounting pleasant encounters with the prince.</p><p>So, when Eijirou had the opportunity, he grabbed all the clothes Mina had gathered, shoved the mystical jug into his pocket and sneaked outside, up to the river stream. He knew Mina could help him a lot more but Eijirou wanted to try out some stuff himself. He had relied on his friends so much the last week, he wanted to lift some of their burdens.</p><p>He hid behind the trees next to the river, folded out his clothes and smeared some of the substance into his hair. It was strange how the pot never seemed to become emptier. But who was he to question some magical pot of hair dying substance?</p><p>The next step was to come up with an acceptable outfit with his limited choices and a new hairstyle.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>The two days after the banquet, Bakugou was just furious. Outstandingly furious. He snapped at everything and everyone, making them stay out of his way altogether. It was better for everyone involved. He was outraged, to be just ditched like that. What was Kirishima thinking who he was? He was just a lowly noble, just recently established and then he ditched him, the prince?</p><p>It was both infuriating and humiliating. He knew he wasn\u2019t the most amiable person to ever exist, but he thought that Kirishima didn\u2019t mind because, well, he didn\u2019t evade him because of it and could actually hold a conversation without licking the ground he was walking on. It was\u2026 nice. To talk to someone without being held to the standards of a prince, to just be a man.</p><p>Nevertheless, he ditched him. Just after they had the most exciting sparring fight he had in a long time. Did he do something wrong? Did he say something? Did he insult him by kicking him in the mud? It could be all three possibilities.</p><p>After he finally got himself out of his self-pity, Bakugou at first thought about just forgetting about Kirishima. They would probably never meet again. That was okay. He didn\u2019t need him. Then, when he was being dressed by his maids, Bakugou wasn\u2019t sure why but something Kirishima had said popped up in his head, he looked down at the maids, observing their movements, and asked:</p><p>\u201cShould I\u201d, the maids\u2019 heads jerked up in alarm as they heard him growling, \u201cstay differently, so you can reach better?\u201d He was one head and a half taller than them and they often had to stretch to their toes to reach his shoulder or even get a stool to stand on. The next few seconds were filled with silence, nobody moving, until Bakugou\u2019s face moved back into his usual scowl.</p><p>\u201cCould you\u201d, the maid behind his back quietly piped up, \u201chold up your arms, your Highness?\u201d</p><p>The other maids held their breaths, staring at Bakugou to see his reaction. He nodded sharply and held up his arms as he was asked. The maids exchanged some confused looks but didn\u2019t question his behavior. As they dressed him, the other maids started to request some simple posture changings which he did without complaining. Dressing took less time than usual.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He mumbled when they hurried out the room and they made their curtsies with small smiles to their faces. Huh.</p><p>The next day, he paid attention. To the waiting staff, the errand boys, the servants, the gardeners. And, as Kirishima said, no one paid them any mind, not even half a glance. They just did all the work without complaining, not one hurtful glare against someone who bumped into them or dirtied the hallway just a second after it was cleaned. Maybe, just maybe, there was some truth in what Kirishima had said.</p><p>The day after that, he walked inside the chambers of his mother first thing in the morning. He didn\u2019t care that the guards advised against just walking in without announcing himself but he ignored them in Bakugou-fashion. He kicked the door in without knocking, his mother jerking from her bed. His father kept on snoring next to her.</p><p>\u201cMother.\u201d He growled.</p><p>\u201cSon.\u201d His mother slowly rose, glaring at him. \u201cWhat could be so important for my precious son to wake his mother from her well-earned sleep in this manner?\u201d</p><p>Bakugou had to bite back some inappropriate remark, biting his lower lip. \u201cI want you to hold a banquet. For me.\u201d</p><p>Well, that stunned his mother to silence. \u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes, hard. She didn\u2019t have to make such deal out of it. Sure, he never ever asked for a social event he had to attend, especially not in his name.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. A banquet. Like the monthly thing. Just, make it for internal affairs. Reinforcing the friendship between the castle and the jurisdiction of the Chiba prefecture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInternal\u2014Katsuki, who are you?\u201d His mother grinned at him. \u201cOr is this about a certain red-haired man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014No!\u201d Bakugou spat. \u201cWhat the fuck, mom?\u201d He groaned. \u201cI actually act like the prince you always wanted and then you make it about something stupid like that? Just. Do it.\u201d His lips tightened in a straight line. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Mitsuki had to blink a few times to register what her son had just said. She knew when to push and when to just shut up, she was the one who raised him, after all.</p><p>\u201cSure thing, Katsuki.\u201d</p><p>Bakugou nodded and stormed out her sleeping chambers without saying anything else, seething. That took a lot of his energy. The next days were pretty similar to his usual routine. Classes, sparring, dinner, and lunch. However, since he actually paid attention to their personal, he saw the strained faces, the hectic in their movements and the hurried gestures. It probably wasn\u2019t easy to prepare such a huge banquet on such short notice.</p><p>Bakugou actually felt, what audacity his feelings had these days, guilty. Guilty for putting so much pressure on them on top of their usual workload. So, when he happened to overhear some of the servants talking about the menu, what kind of proteins they still needed, he asked them, if it would help if he hunted down a deer.</p><p>The looks he got were always like a punch to his gut. Was it really so strange to ask if they needed help? Well, yeah, he answered himself, he never did in the past 19 years he had lived here. Nor knew he about anybody else who did.</p><p>That was why he now was riding down the cobblestone path behind the castle walls towards the forest, the royal hunting grounds. The bow was fastened at his saddle for now until he arrived at the forest, a quiver on his belt. Even though there was some pressure of time, Bakugou was relieved to get out of the castle again. He steered his horse down from the paved way and rode towards the small river that streamed parallel to the path towards the forest.</p><p>His horse strode leisurely, not stopping but taking its time to walk through the high grass of the riverbed. Bakugou led his view drift into the distance, relaxing for the first time since a few days. A red do next to a cluster of trees drew its attention to him. He squinted and stopped his horse, one hand on the handle of his hunting knife. He silently cursed himself that he didn\u2019t bring his sword, but what good would a sword do at a hunt anyway?</p><p>After observing the red dot for a few seconds, Bakugou noticed it was moving just slightly back and forth to the river and back to the trees. It seemed human alright. With a swift motion, he got off his horse and gestured the horse to stay put. They knew each other for long enough so it understood. Bakugou drew his knife and silently sneaked up to the patch of trees, squatting down to get a better view through the branches. And what a view he got.</p><p>Kirishima only wore his pants, open at the front. His chest was bare, seeing the dark happy trail from the navel down and Bakugou could finally confirm that he was built. Like a wall. His hair was pulled back into a sloppy ponytail, a few strands framing his face. His mouth was pulled in a frown as he grabbed one of the shirts laying on the ground and put it on. Kirishima tucked the shirt in, tugging on it for good measure and walked towards the river to look at his reflection.</p><p>Bakugou felt his face heat up, his heart accelerating its beating. He wasn\u2019t a peeping tom so he put his knife away, stood up straight and cleared his throat.</p><p>Kirishima spun around so fast, he almost lost his footing, stumbling violently before catching himself and leveling his eyes on Bakugou. His cheeks rose in color ever so lightly, but Bakugou decided to ignore it for now.</p><p>\u201cY-Your Highness?\u201d Kirishima croaked, fumbling with his clothes, tugging at his hair, a nervous wreck some would say.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing here?\u201d Bakugou crossed his arms. Even if he was in no position to judge, this was still inside the castle walls, somewhere far away for people to see, so why would Kirishima sneak around to try on his clothes?</p><p>\u201cI- uhm\u201d, Kirishima stammered, slowly walking towards the shirts that were laying on the ground to obscure Bakugou\u2019s view on them, kicking at them with his heel to gather them up. Bakugou raised his eyebrow at that.</p><p>\u201cI was\u2026\u201d, Kirishima looked over his shoulder, biting so hard on his lip Bakugou thought it would draw blood and sighed in defeat. \u201cI was looking for something to wear for the banquet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming?\u201d Bakugou could just hope he didn\u2019t sound as eager as he felt.</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah\u201d, Kirishima shrugged. \u201cYour Highness invited all noble families of the Chiba jurisdiction, would be kinda impolite to not attend, I guess?\u201d The first smile from him finally stretched over his face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn right.\u201d Bakugou scoffed. Then his eyes drove over Kirishima, finally looking at the outfit Kirishima wore. \u201cThat looks fucking hideous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, really?\u201d Kirishima frowned, looking down at himself. \u201cI was pretty confident in this.\u201d Bakugou huffed a small laughter, covering it with a cough. With two big steps, he was right beside Kirishima who looked at him with big eyes. Trying to ignore his gaze on him, Bakugou eyed the different shirts, pants and the two vests. Not exactly the wardrobe of a noble.</p><p>\u201cWhy for fuck\u2019s sake are you dressing up in the middle of the royal castle walls?\u201d He grumbled. There was no heat in his words, he realized that himself already, just curiosity. Kirishima coughed, scratching his neck. He kneeled down to his shirts, pulling at their hems.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u201d, Kirishima bit his lips. Bakugou subconsciously filed it under a nervous tick. \u201cI don\u2019t have that much to choose from.\u201d He silently said, chuckling dryly. It didn\u2019t fit him. \u201cIt\u2019s not much and I have to dress myself. Something Your Highness probably isn\u2019t used to.\u201d A wink at him and Bakugou didn\u2019t know if his cheeks heated up in humiliation or embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d He huffed as he squatted down as well and earned a more earnest chuckle. \u201cAt least I know that this shirt\u201d, he jabbed a finger against Kirishima\u2019s firm chest, \u201cdoesn\u2019t fit your pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the pants are nice, aren\u2019t they?!\u201d Kirishima cried out in mocking despair.</p><p>\u201cThey are.\u201d Bakugou grunted. He pulled at some of the shirts, eyes going back and forth between the shirts and Kirishima\u2019s black pants until they settled on a white shirt with a puffy collar and sleeves. He grabbed it and hold it in front of Kirishima who eyed him curiously.</p><p>\u201cPut this on.\u201d He ordered, grabbing for one of the small vests. In the corner of his eye, he could see Kirishima undress before pulling the other shirt over his head. His eyes darted down at his chest for just a second before staring back at the vest in his hands.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Kirishima tugged the hem into his pants, fastening the cords at the frills of his sleeves. Bakugou helped him with his left sleeve and threw the vest in his face. Kirishima chuckled and tucked his arms through the open sleeve holes, butting it up. There were just three buttons, ending just shy under the poof of his collar, accentuating his broad chest just a little more.</p><p>\u201cDo I\u2026 Does it look good?\u201d Kirishima smiled shyly at him, doing things to his gut. Bakugou nodded once before Kirishima trotted over to the water, examining his reflection. Seemingly pleased, he offered Bakugou a wide grin.</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d He beamed at him. Huh, it actually feels nice to hear a thank you for something he did.</p><p>\u201cYou still didn\u2019t answer why the fuck you\u2019re inside the walls.\u201d Bakugou growled. \u201cNobody in his right mind would sneak up inside just to play dress up.\u201d</p><p>Kirishima looked caught, fumbling with his sleeves. His eyes darted around, looking everywhere but at Bakugou.</p><p>\u201cStop stalling. Just fucking tell me.\u201d He snapped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d, Kirishima sighed, \u201cI mean no harm, I promise. I can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t tell you, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Bakugou\u2019s eyes narrowed down at him but couldn\u2019t find any sign that indicated he was lying or wanted to deceive him in any way. He scoffed.</p><p>\u201cSuit your-fucking-self.\u201d</p><p>Kirishima threw him another apologetic smile. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>An awkward silence stretched between them, making both of them uncomfortable. Bakugou glared at the ground, stuffing down the slight pricking feeling in his chest.</p><p>\u201cSo\u201d, Kirishima walked up to him, \u201cwhat are you doing here?\u201d Bakugou threw a glance over his shoulder to see his horse grassing right where he left him.</p><p>\u201cOn my way to hunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Kirishima exclaimed, clapping his hands. \u201cFor the banquet?\u201d He nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnything in particular? Deer? Boar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeer. Probably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm\u201d, Kirishima hummed. \u201cI wonder how it\u2019ll taste?\u201d he mumbled. Bakugou wasn\u2019t sure if it was meant for him to hear but he huffed, nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cLike fucking deer. I don\u2019t think deer tastes differently in other prefectures.\u201d Kirishima threw him an unreadable glance.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m gonna find out anyway, huh?\u201d Kirishima smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cYou want to come with me?\u201d They blinked at each other before Bakugou\u2019s brain caught up with his mouth. He coughed, taking a step back.</p><p>\u201cForget tha\u2014\u201c \u2013 \u201cSure.\u201d They spoke at the same time. Bakugou\u2019s gaze shot up, meeting Kirishima\u2019s, cheeks slightly reddened.</p><p>\u201cAh, but I don\u2019t really know how to hunt, so I won\u2019t be of any help.\u201d Kirishima scratched his cheek. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Bakugou huffed. \u201cI\u2019m more than capable enough. Just don\u2019t scare it away.\u201d He turned around on his heels, not looking if Kirishima followed him, only hearing his footsteps falling in line behind him. He took the reins of his horse again when they reached it and climbed into his saddle again. He stepped out of the stirrup iron on Kirishima\u2019s side and threw him an awaiting glance.</p><p>Kirishima hesitated only for a second, taking a step forward and grabbing the hand Bakugou offered. It was warm. Kirishima put one foot in the stirrup and with a little effort, Bakugou pulled him up. Kirishima slid behind him in his saddle, his back flushed against Kirishima\u2019s chest. He hoped Kirishima wouldn\u2019t notice how hard his heart was hammering in his chest.</p><p>Bakugou steered his horse back on track and silently they rode towards the forest. Kirishima\u2019s breath tickled against his neck, sometimes his ear whenever he turned his head to look around, gasping voiceless at the view or an animal or whatever he deemed interesting. Bakugou tried really hard to focus on his environment, but that proved really hard with Kirishima literally all around him. His breath and voice surrounding his head, his arms pulled lightly around his waist, their torso\u2019s and thighs pressed against each other.</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d Kirishima mumbled softly into his ear. Bakugou could feel the tips of his ears burn, just where he felt Kirishima\u2019s breath. He pointed carefully between two trees and when Bakugou followed his line of sight, he saw a deer, antlers growing high above his head.</p><p>Ever so slowly, Bakugou reached for his bow, stroking over Kirishima\u2019s thigh with the motion, pulling out an arrow with his other hand. His motions were slow but without hesitation, assertive. He drew his arrow, aimed with one eye closed, feeling Kirishima\u2019s chest rising against his back. Their breathing was in synch, he felt Kirishima exhaling by his chest flattening and let go of his arrow.</p><p>The arrowhead shot through the branches right above the deer\u2019s front legs through his ribs, killing it instantly. Kirishima gasped again.</p><p>\u201cAmazing.\u201d His grip tightened around Bakugou\u2019s waist.</p><p>\u201cI fucking know\u201d, he grumbled more out of reflex. He fastened his bow back on the saddle and galloped over to their prey. He slid down from the saddle, landing on the ground with a soft thud and kneed down. Pulling out his knife, he heard Kirishima land behind him, and slit his knife through the deer\u2019s throat to let it bleed out.</p><p>\u201cWe let it bleed out and then the kitchen staff will take care of the rest.\u201d He explained without being asked to, seeing Kirishima nod next to him.</p><p>\u201cYou never skin and gut it yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No. It\u2019s all dirty and gross.\u201d</p><p>Kirishima laughed airily. \u201cWell, I think, if you want to eat something you have to go through the whole process.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you never fucking hunted yourself. So, you don\u2019t actually deserve to eat deer yourself.\u201d Bakugou shot back. Kirishima didn\u2019t say anything, just held his hand open for the knife. Groaning at himself, finally catching up what was going on, he handed Kirishima the knife. For someone who was praised to be a genius he sometimes was a little dense.</p><p>\u201cYou never ate deer before.\u201d He answered himself quietly. Kirishima hummed and began to hold up the knife before stopping.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d Bakugou rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cMy clothes!\u201d Kirishima put the knife down and stripped off his vest and shirt with deft fingers. His skin was slightly flushed as he kneeled back down, grabbing for the knife again. He set the knife at the bottom of the deer\u2019s throat, Bakugou could see Kirishima\u2019s muscles tense up as he pulled the knife from left to right in one firm stroke.</p><p>Immediately, all innards fell out. Fortunately, it already bled out enough from its throat so not too much blood came out through the cut. Kirishima wiped the Knife on the grass to get the excess blood off from it and then grabbed at intestines and stomach and whatnot. He just grabbed it with his bare hands. Bakugou stared at him as if he wasn\u2019t human.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026 you just do that?\u201d</p><p>Kirishima blinked at him. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause\u2014\u201d Bakugou stopped himself. Because it\u2019s the servants\u2019 job, was what he wanted to say but knowing Kirishima well enough, he would insult him with this thinking. He nodded, took a deep breath and watched Kirishima gutting the deer. After a short while, Kirishima began to explain what he was doing. He couldn\u2019t name much of the anatomy of the deer, Bakugou filled these blanks, but had extensive knowledge about the right procedure to prepare a deer to be cooked.</p><p>It took them about half an hour to get all its intestines properly wrapped up, another half an hour to skin it, and then strapped the deer on the back of Bakugou\u2019s horse. They opted to walk beside the horse, Kirishima said to have an eye on the deer so it wouldn\u2019t slide down but Bakugou understood that he didn\u2019t want to strain his horse too much with two grown men and a deer on its back. No way, he would ride then.</p><p>Bakugou had taken Kirishima\u2019s clothes and held onto it for now since Kirishima\u2019s arms were still dipped in blood right up to his elbows. After exiting the forest, Bakugou steered them back to the river and Kirishima could wash his arms. When he emerged from the water and strutted over to him, asking silently for his clothes, Bakugou had to force himself to give it back to him, he had to admit.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Ba- Your Highness.\u201d Kirishima snapped his eyes to the ground as he stumbled over his words, pulling the shirt over his head. Bakugou squinted his eyes at him but let it slide. He crossed his arms and waited.</p><p>\u201cNo, really, thank you.\u201d Kirishima said again. \u201cFor, you know, taking me with you and\u201d, he gestured at himself, \u201chelping me out.\u201d</p><p>Bakugou huffed and pulled himself back into the saddle. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>Kirishima beamed at him. \u201cSee you at the banquet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better will.\u201d He steered his horse back to the cobbled path, hitting its flanks with his heels and galloped back to the castle before he could look back.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Eijirou stood at the river as long as he could see the prince ride away. At the same time, he wished for Bakugou to turn around and to just ride away as fast as he could. Bakugou took the decision from him as he galloped away. He let out a breath he didn\u2019t know he held in.</p><p>He squatted down, hands to his face a made a noise between a squeal and a giggle. No, this couldn\u2019t be happening. No. Nope. Eijirou walked up to the patch of trees, grabbed all the clothes and, finally, ran all the way back. He already took long enough as it was. He ignored all the looks he got and was relieved he could say his red face was because of the running.</p><p>He slid into his chamber and stuffed the clothes under his bed, changing out of his current outfit. He put on his simple linen clothing, pulled his headband around his red hair and ran all the way back to the kitchen and asked for something, anything to do. He needed to be distracted.</p><p>After tackling every possible assignment, Eijirou made his way back to their chambers when it was already late. He stumbled into the room, trying to be as quiet as possible but as soon as the door swung open, his friends were on their feet, lighting a candle.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?!\u201d They all whispered loudly in unison.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Kirishima stuttered. His brain provided him instantly with his memories of today\u2019s afternoon, Bakugou\u2019s eyes constantly roaming over his own naked chest, his body pressed against him, brushing against each other with every step the horse had taken. His face flushed unbelievable hot.</p><p>\u201cYou met the prince, haven\u2019t you?\u201d Mina gave him a knowing look, receiving nothing but a nod in confirmation. His friends high fived each other.</p><p>\u201cGuys\u201d, Eijirou whined, \u201cthat\u2019s not something to celebrate. I will only meet him once again and then never again. This just makes everything\u201d, he huffed in annoyance, \u201cmore complicated.\u201d</p><p>His friends followed him with his eyes as he prepared for bed, exchanging glanced.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Denki asked.</p><p>Eijirou\u2019s shoulders tensed before falling down. \u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s talk hypothetically.\u201d He sat down on his bed, his friends following suit. \u201cHypothetically, I like him. And he liked me. We met at the banquet, becoming even better friends. Yeah, well, surprise I have to move to another country, so see you never again.\u201d He groaned. \u201cThis will just\u2026 suck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if you just, I don\u2019t know, play along for a little longer?\u201d Mina asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cDeceiving him? Playing someone, I am not? Yeah, great. And either it will suck even more when we have to stop seeing each other or he\u2019ll find out eventually and take it upon himself to stab me to death. I don\u2019t want to\u2026\u201d, he clenched his jaw, \u201cI don\u2019t want to lie to him anymore. I mean, hypothetically, if I liked him, lying to the person you like is just not right.\u201d Eijirou fell backward onto his pillow, both arms spread to his sides, bumping against the wall with his knuckles.</p><p>\u201cJust two more days.\u201d He mumbled into the almost darkness. His friends stayed silent. There wasn\u2019t anything they could say because deep down, they knew Eijirou was right. There was no possible solution that a prince and a servant could ever be friends, let alone anything else.</p><p>Eijirou tried not to think about the upcoming banquet too hard for the next days but that was kind of impossible since every waking second he was reminded that it was happening due to all the assignments their wing was flooded with. The day before the banquet was especially brutal. Some of the guests had already arrived and demanded attention on top of preparing for the event. Eijirou still was grateful, working and running around at least occupied his brain well enough to actually think about that he would be attending as well.</p><p>Well, until it was finally was the day of the banquet. His thoughts caught up with the impending task at hand and made him jittery. His hands trembled, his mind wandered. What he couldn\u2019t really grasp was, was it just anticipation acting as a noble or did he, as a matter of fact, not want to part ways with the prince? He didn\u2019t know and, to be honest, he didn\u2019t want to know.</p><p>When it was finally time to get ready, all the other servants ushered him out of the kitchen, encouraging to do whatever he wanted, with a wink, that they could handle the rest. With a heavy sigh, he left for his chambers where Mina was already waiting for him.</p><p>\u201cWow, you look like you\u2019re on the way to a funeral.\u201d She smacked his back. \u201cCheer up, you\u2019re gonna see your prince tonight.\u201d She chuckled with a knowing look.</p><p>\u201cHe is not my prince\u201d, he grumbled in response but, oh no, did he want him to be his? Shaking his head, he banished the thought as soon as it came up and pulled out the clothes he prepared for tonight. Mina helped him dress, to give a few knowing tucks so it framed his body just the right way.</p><p>Eijirou had already smeared some of the substance into his air before he went to bed last night, not entirely sure how much time he would have for getting ready. Turned out, enough time.</p><p>\u201cSit\u201d, Mina ushered him to sit on the floor in front of the bed, sitting down behind him. She brushed his hair with a broken comb and started to part his hair. Slowly she started to braid different wisps of hair on the side until it united in the middle of the back of his head and became one thicker braided tail, which was slightly raised with a black bow. The end of the ponytail was fastened with a thin black strand.</p><p>Eijirou carefully drove his hand over his hair, feeling the tight strands and when Mina handed him her mirror, he let out a tiny gasp.</p><p>\u201cMina!\u201d He turned his head from one side to the other, a few shorter strands on his forehead bobbing with the motion, and his smile grew. \u201cThat looks amazing! Thank you!\u201d He turned around fully and pulled her in a firm embrace. Mina laughed into his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not difficult to make a pretty person pretty.\u201d She tightened her hold for a second before they both let go. \u201cEijirou\u201d, she tugged at his frilly collar, stroking over his vest.</p><p>\u201cI want you to know, that we will be on your side. Whatever will happen, whatever your decision will be.\u201d</p><p>Eijirou nodded, trying not to cry on the spot. Mina patted his cheek. \u201cYou still have time to cry. As soon as I\u2019m finished with you I won\u2019t let you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMina!\u201d Eijirou wailed, again, pressing his face into her chest. She patted his hair and hushed him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, took in a deep breath and sat up again. \u201cAlright.\u201d Mina grabbed some of the make-up utensils she could gather over the span of last week with the help of other maids and started to apply some powder on his cheeks, drew a fine line on the wing of his eyelids with charcoal and dabbed some red substance onto his lips, making them even rosier than they were anyway.</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d Mina admired her own work.</p><p>Eijirou took his time to mentally prepare himself, just staring at the wall of their chamber, Mina at his side, holding his hand. They went through the plan often enough he could recite it by heart. In hindsight, he was grateful for Tetsutetsu to get all the other servants on board with this over the top stupid plan. It took some pressure off his shoulder, especially, since the servant who was announcing the guests was as excited as everybody else and could play the part, so he didn\u2019t have to sneak in again. Particularly, because this is an event hosted for his apparent home prefecture and it would seem pretty odd that he had to sneak in for that.</p><p>Come in, eat and drink something, tell Bakugou he needed to leave the country because he was promised some young maiden in a far away state and then leave. Easy enough.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Bakugou was in high spirit in the past few days. High spirit meant, he didn\u2019t snap at everything and some of his heat left his voice, but rarely someone noticed. Still, Bakugou could feel a little change in his mood. Was it because of the little trip with Kirishima? Probably. But he wouldn\u2019t admit to that out loud.</p><p>He noticed a difference in how he was treated by the servants as well as much as he treated them differently. Not that he thanked them for everything they did, it was still their job, but he at least acknowledged their existence, gave them a short nod when, for example, one of them brought him a snack or he saw maids dusting off the busts in the hallway. Which made them a little less\u2026 afraid of him, Bakugou dared to say. He didn\u2019t think it was bad to be afraid of him, it meant respect. But somehow, being asked by his staff if he liked his tea rather with one or two spoons of sugar instead of just needed to be told how he wanted it, felt something akin to trust to him.</p><p>Trust with the people he wanted to lead.</p><p>\u201cDid something good happen, Your Highness?\u201d</p><p>Aizawa pulled him out of thoughts. He didn\u2019t listen for the past few minutes, he assumed. Blinking the thoughts away, Bakugou wore his usual scowl etched on his face.</p><p>\u201cThe fuck you want?\u201d</p><p>Unfazed, Aizawa turned back two pages and sighed. \u201cJust asking. I thought for a second there, you were smiling. Must be a trick of my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn sure it was.\u201d Bakugou snapped but turned his face down to the desk. Just in case. There was no way, such stupid, sappy thoughts would make him smile. Fortunately for him, Aizawa didn\u2019t care much about his current mental state and continued or rather repeated his lecture about the Chiba prefecture. Bakugou was making sure he knew about each and everything of the regions so he could host the best banquet they had ever attended.</p><p>Time flew by, the day filled with his usual routine of lecture, lunch, greeting some of the early guests and getting ready for the banquet. He noticed as the maids dressed him that they were a little more fidgeting, suppressed smiles here and there. He didn\u2019t stoop so low as to ask what was that all about even if his curiosity was stretched to its limit. Instead, he looked at his reflection in the wide mirror, tucking at his collar and sleeves to make himself more comfortable, and thought about someone he might, he better be, meet this evening.</p><p>Kirishima was a mystery to him. Starting by his appearance, what noble did have red hair? And it looked natural, he couldn\u2019t really be at fault but he could try to get some hair masks or whatever, so it wouldn\u2019t be that red. But it matched his eye color which was satisfying. And of course, the main reason he was such a mystery was his demeanor toward nobility. There was leisure in his speech, his gestures, his being he wasn\u2019t used to in a noble. Which was refreshing. He felt like talking to a human being and not someone who recited the usual pleasantries. Especially, he felt he could talk to him freely. Because or Kirishima\u2019s leisure he didn\u2019t feel like Kirishima forced himself to speak with him or to kiss his ass, just, he was honest.</p><p>He wanted to know the secrets Kirishima harbored. There was something he didn\u2019t tell him, obviously, and it felt like a challenge. Was he worthy enough to encode this enigma called Kirishima Eijirou?</p><p>His feet brought him to the ballroom, he nodded toward the servants opening the door and received small bows, and entered the room which was slowly filled with attendees. Automatically, his eyes scanned the crowd for a specific redhead but didn\u2019t find anything. He tried to ignore the disappointment in his chest. Taking in a deep breath he made his way to the side of his mother, greeting everyone who stopped him.</p><p>Whenever the door opened, his head jerked up, squinting at the people coming in and whenever it was not a specific red-haired man, his scowl grew deeper.</p><p>\u201cWhat made you so peeved, my dear son?\u201d His mother nudged him with her elbow, pushing it deep between his ribs and he suppressed a wince.</p><p>\u201cShut up. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHum.\u201d She hummed, grin growing a little wider, a little wickeder. \u201cAwaiting someone?\u201d Bakugou narrowed his eyes on her and clicked his tongue.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I? Just waiting for everybody to arrive to eat, I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure, you aren\u2019t thirsty?\u201d</p><p>Bakugou chocked on his own spit and spun around. \u201cMother\u2014\u201d but before he could finish his sentence, the door opened again and his ears heard the quiet announcement.</p><p>\u201cSir Kirishima Eijirou, first and only son of Lady Kirishima Tomoya.\u201d</p><p>Bakugou\u2019s voice died in his throat as he looked up to Kirishima walking through the doors, wearing the outfit he put together for him and an elaborate hairstyle. Maybe it was the chandelier or the lightning overall but to him, it looked like Kirishima was glowing.</p><p>He didn\u2019t hear what his mother said to him, just walking right up to Kirishima who was already getting attention by other bystanders. He pushed through them until he was right in front of him.</p><p>\u201cFinally decided to show up, dumbwhit?\u201d He crossed his arms, taking a quick once over glance at Kirishima before settling on the small smile that appeared on his face.</p><p>\u201cAw, did Your Highness miss me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fucking wish.\u201d His fist shot out against the other\u2019s shoulder earning a small grunt, but it turned into a chuckle. Kirishima rubbed at his shoulder and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNeed \u00a0to work on my reflexes so I can kick you\u2019re a\u2014to win fair and square.\u201d He coughed and scratched his cheek.</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck do you think I care about your wording?\u201d As if caught, Kirishima\u2019s eyes shot open, blinking.</p><p>\u201cUh, I\u2026\u201d, his hand traveled to his neck, rubbing at it, \u201cI mean, you\u2019re still the prince and I\u2019m far beneath you, so\u201d, he shrugged as he trailed off, eyes looking up at him sheepishly. \u201cDo you\u2026 don\u2019t want me to?\u201d</p><p>Bakugou glared at him with a small grunt and shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s whatever. I don\u2019t care.\u201d Kirishima hummed, leaning over a little.</p><p>\u201cThen, Your Highness, please let me kick your ass next time we spar.\u201d Bakugou\u2019s eyes narrowed down on Kirishima\u2019s beaming smile and shoved his shoulder at him.</p><p>\u201cBig words for someone who couldn\u2019t even get one hit in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI almost had you\u2026 that one time, I think.\u201d</p><p>Bakugou chuckled ever so lightly at the contemplating look on Kirishima\u2019s face. \u201cYou and thinking? I highly doubt that.\u201d When their eyes locked, his heart stuttered for just a second when he saw the tiny, yet warm smile meant for him.</p><p>\u201cSo, you do can laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off!\u201d Bakugou shoved at him again but Kirishima was laughing wholeheartedly already.</p><p>For the next hour, they kept on bantering, trying to one-up each other for their next sparring session and walked around the room. Bakugou had to stop every now and then to hold an obliging conversation with which he really could live without. His eyes always trailed off to his side, where Kirishima was apparently glued to him, never really leaving him but not chiming in in the conversation. Afterward, when they were alone again, Bakugou listed off some trivial information of the noble they were talking to. Not to impress Kirishima or anything.</p><p>Then, a small bell was rung, and his mother invited their guests to join her at the dinner table. Bakugou made a face and lead Kirishima to the table, scanning it for Kirishima\u2019s name badge and was pleasantly surprised to find him seated directly at his side. Whoever decided their seating order needed to be thanked. He almost pulled out the chair to offer it to Kirishima but could stop himself in time. Instead, he sat down on his own chair, registering by the movement next to him that Kirishima sat down as well.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what will be served?\u201d Kirishima leaned in and whispered to Bakugou. He just shrugged.</p><p>\u201cProbably the same as always. Soup, fish, meat, dessert.\u201d Pushing his lips up a little higher in a scowl. \u201cAlways the same.\u201d</p><p>Kirishima tilted his head at that. \u201cYou\u2026 don\u2019t like having four different courses?\u201d Bakugou rolled his eyes and groaned.</p><p>\u201cNo, Shitty-shima, I don\u2019t like having the same four courses every damn day. I thought we have top chefs who like to experiment and give us something to look forward to and not this bland shit, every day.\u201d</p><p>His mother cleared her throat and shot him a meaningful glare which he answered in the same manner. She rolled her eyes and stood up, all conversations died down.</p><p>\u201cMy honored guests, it is my pleasure to welcome you at our home.\u201d She raised her glass. \u201cIt is not only a joy for me to see you come from a faraway place to strengthen our bonds but, as well, that my son takes it upon himself to fight for these bonds.\u201d</p><p>He scuffed under his breath but Kirishima nudged his knee under the table, nodding at him with a smile.</p><p>\u201cSo, thank you, my dear son, Katsuki, to present us this opportunity. Would you like to say something yourself to our guests?\u201d</p><p>\u2018No\u2019 was the first thing he wanted to say but clenched his jaw to not blurt it out. His eyes found Kirishima\u2019s and he sighed. He stood up with a glass in his hand, looking them all over once.</p><p>\u201cThank you for following my invitation when I reached out for you. It is a great honor to have you all assembled in these halls and I hope to nourish our relationship with newly found friends and allies.\u201d His expression turned a little sour. He hated speaking as if he had a stick up his ass. \u201cThen, let\u2019s toast to our friends and eat to our heart\u2019s desire, I\u2019m fucking starving.\u201d He down his glass and sat down.</p><p>Kirishima was the first to break the stunned silence with a laugh and the others followed suit. Pleased by himself, Bakugou gave his mother a courteous nod who in turn fixed him with a knowing look in her eyes, dancing between him and Kirishima. He chose to ignore that and turned his attention back to Kirishima who was beaming at the soup that was brought in.</p><p>\u201cThat looks delicious!\u201d He gasped as a bowl was put in front of him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fucking soup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, Your Highness, even \u2018fucking soup\u2019 can taste pretty good!\u201d Kirishima mimicked his words with the same grumpy expression, Bakugou assumed he was wearing right now and kicked Kirishima under the table, earning a snicker.</p><p>It was fascinating to watch Kirishima eat a simple potato soup as if it was some blessed meal. His face beamed with every spoonful, humming every other bite and when he wiped his bowl clean with the slice of bread, it was pure bliss on his face. It was fucking soup. And yet, it made Bakugou enjoy his own soup a little more, admitting that it, in fact, did taste pretty good.</p><p>When the fish was served, Bakugou witnessed a rather peculiar situation. He was just quipping back in forth with his parents, when he out of the corner of his eye saw that Kirishima was grabbing for the wrong knife regarding eating fish. When he was about to say something, Kirishima locked eyes with the servant on the other side of the table. They shook their head so lightly, it was only visible if you look for it. Kirishima then moved his hand to the next, another shake and when he touched the right knife, he got a nod. They exchanged a subtle smile and the servant was gone.</p><p>As if nothing had happened, Kirishima turned back to Bakugou, grinning at him.</p><p>\u201cDo you know which fish will be served?\u201d</p><p>Still a little dumbfounded what he just witnessed, Bakugou shook his head. \u201cFish.\u201d He deadpanned. Kirishima chuckled at him.</p><p>\u201cI sure hope it is fish since it is the fish course. Man\u201d, his eyes grew distant, \u201cif that\u2019s all it takes to be a prince, I have a pretty good chance to become one myself.\u201d</p><p>That earned him, at the same time, a hard kick under the table and a chuckle from the queen. Kirishima\u2019s quiet yelp was accompanied by his flashing cheeks as he shot a glance towards the queen. A shy smile formed on his lips.</p><p>\u201cThis is Sir Kirishima Eijirou from whom I\u2019ve heard a lot recently, isn\u2019t he?\u201d The queen asked between bites.</p><p>\u201cY-yes, Your Majesty.\u201d Kirishima bowed his head slightly and Bakugou could see him fumble, apparently undecided if he was allowed to continue eating or waiting for some conversation. He rolled his eyes and nudged his knee, nodding at his fish. Relief washed over Kirishima as he took the next bite.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen Katsuki hold such a long conversation in a long time without chasing the other party away. What\u2019s your secret?\u201d</p><p>Kirishima snorted slightly but shook his head. \u201cNo secret, Your Majesty. Just honest\u2026 I like the way he is.\u201d Another smile, almost fond, formed on his lips and a bit of fish fell from Bakugou\u2019s fork as he stopped it right before his mouth. Ignoring the heat forming on his cheeks he bit down hard on his fork.</p><p>His mother just laughed. \u201cOh, dear Sir, that is truly fascinating. Do tell, what is it you like about my son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother!\u201d Bakugou almost shouted, heads turning to see what the commotion was about. Bakugou glared at his mother, having a silent conversation with his eyes alone. Which Mitsuki choose to ignore.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Katsuki? I just thought it was nice to know about redeeming qualities you have I\u2019m not aware of.\u201d Her smile stretched on his face, every inch of it smug.</p><p>\u201cOh, is it so hard to believe someone likes the son you raised? That is really reassuring.\u201d Bakugou snapped with fake hurt, lashing his anger out on his fish. The queen waited for another second before bursting out in a fit of laughter, dispersing the heavy atmosphere that had formed. Bakugou grumbled.</p><p>Kirishima touched his elbow with his own, searching for his eyes. He glanced over, pursing his lips. Slightly leaning forward, Kirishima held their gaze and whispered.</p><p>\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I like how determined you are, among other things.\u201d He had the audacity to wink at him. Bakugou felt another wave of heat rising up his face but also in his chest, tightening around his lungs. He grunted in response.</p><p>When they were finished with the fish, Kirishima leaned over again. His eyes were cast down, his fingers twitching at his napkin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014Can we talk after dinner? There is something I have to tell you.\u201d</p><p>Bakugou\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhy not tell me fucking now?\u201d</p><p>Kirishima shook his head, a sad smile on his lips he didn\u2019t like one bit. \u201cWe should talk\u2026 in private.\u201d Bakugou rolled his eyes but nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Whatever, indeed. It wasn\u2019t important that his heart clenched by the sorrowful look Kirishima wore or that he held his breath when he thought about what Kirishima had to tell him in private.</p><p>When the meat course was served, his mother raised her glass again. \u201cI want to thank my son since he was the one who shot the deer for us today.\u201d</p><p>Quiet \u2018oh\u2019s and \u2018ah\u2019s were uttered.</p><p>\u201cKirishima helped.\u201d Bakugou grumbled. His mother raised her eyebrows, tilting her head.</p><p>\u201cOh? I wasn\u2019t aware of that. Of course, thank you, Sir Kirishima, as well. How come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Kirishima\u2019s eyes widened and Bakugou saw him looking over to him in search for help.</p><p>\u201cWe just kinda ran into each other. And since I was on my way I just invited him to tag along. He was the one who\u2014\u201d Kirishima stepped on his foot and shook his head almost undetectable. Bakugou stumbled a little over his words and glared at him.</p><p>\u201cWe both took it down.\u201d He said in the end. His mother nodded again, forming polite conversation with the person next to his father, throwing Bakugou a meaningful look. But Bakugou had already turned his head to Kirishima.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck was that about?\u201d He hissed. Kirishima shrugged at him noncommittally.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want people to know.\u201d It was rather formed a question as he raised his voice at the end. Bakugou pinched his nose with two fingers, taking a few deep breaths. Why in the world was he keeping up with this? There was no logical reason and he was well aware of that fact, making it even more frustrating to him. Glancing back to Kirishima and seeing him savoring the meat, however, he decided it didn\u2019t matter really that much that he knew why.</p><p>\u201cAre all banquets like that?\u201d Kirishima asked in between bites.</p><p>Bakugou finally started eating as well. \u201cMostly. It\u2019s literally a banquet, dumbass.\u201d He scowled at Kirishima\u2019s chuckle. \u201cSometimes there are dances, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDances?\u201d Kirishima beamed at him. \u201cAw, man, that would have been great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, you like dances?\u201d Bakugou perked one eyebrow up. \u201cDon\u2019t look like one to dance.\u201d</p><p>Kirishima shrugged. \u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t actually. I mean, I don\u2019t know how\u201d, lowering his voice Kirishima poked at his meat, \u201cbut I wanted to attend a formal dance for so long, you know. Preferable after I learned how to dance.\u201d Another chuckle.</p><p>Bakugou eyed him for a second, an idea forming inside his head and before he could stop himself, he said: \u201cI could teach you.\u201d</p><p>Kirishima\u2019s head jerked up, staring at him with glistening eyes. \u201cYou would?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIdiot\u201d, Bakugou cleared his throat, chewing the rest of his meat in his mouth, \u201cthat\u2019s what I said, didn\u2019t I?\u201d He fixed his eyes back on the plate since he couldn\u2019t bear looking further at Kirishima\u2019s blinding smile. A few seconds went by without Kirishima answering so he chanced another glance.</p><p>Kirishima separated the vegetables from his meat with his fork, poking at it absentmindedly. His smile was already dropped and Bakugou felt his chest tighten, again. Should he see his physician about this?</p><p>\u201cGot a problem with that?\u201d he snapped instead.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Kirishima blinked up at him. \u201cNo! No, not at all. It\u2019s just\u2026\u201d he bit his lip, avoiding his gaze. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you later, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with all that\u2014\u201d \u2013 \u201cSo, Sir Kirishima\u201d, his mother interrupted him mid-sentence and he had to count from 10 backward to no yell at her.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t your mother come to join us today? I would have thought, she would be delighted as a recently declared Lady?\u201d She took a long sip, fixing Kirishima in his seat with her eyes.</p><p>\u201cY-yes, Your Majesty.\u201d Kirishima voice sounded raspy. \u201cShe extends her thanks for the invitation, however, she couldn\u2019t make it because of her health.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear. I hope she will get better soon.\u201d Bakugou\u2019s mother held a hand to her chest, shaking her head. \u201cI hope she can join us for the next banquet. I\u2019d like to meet the woman who raised such a good boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo see how it\u2019s actually done?\u201d Bakugou finally quipped. He wasn\u2019t to let it slide that she kept interrupting him and made a fool out of him. His mother shot him a glare.</p><p>\u201cFor you to see how to treat a mother right, my dear son.\u201d</p><p>He heard Kirishima stifle a laugh next to him, so he jerked his head around. \u201cYou fucker like laughing about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no\u201d, he grinned, holding a hand up in front of his mouth, \u201cit\u2019s just\u2026 I\u2019m happy to see you\u2019re having such a good relationship with your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWha\u2014Where did you get that idea from?!\u201d Bakugou blinked at him incredulously. Kirishima leaned back against his chair, humming.</p><p>\u201cWell, you can only really banter like this with someone you actually care about, don\u2019t you?\u201d A fond smile spread over his face. Did he wear make-up? Bakugou noticed the thin black line on his eyelid, giving his eyes a more edged shape. And before, he thought Kirishima looked a little pale, but now he saw the rosy cheeks shimmer through the face powder.</p><p>He grabbed his glass and took a long sip, whipping the excess wine away with the back of his hand.</p><p>\u201cMy old hag and I aren\u2019t\u2014\u201d he couldn\u2019t finish his sentence, as the giant clock on the wall struck 12, the first bell ringing through the hall. Rolling his eyes, Bakugou waited for the next beat to continue but he noticed Kirishima freezing up beside him, his eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already midnight?\u201d he barely breathed.</p><p>\u201cHuh? Yeah. We started dinner rather late because of those stupid late runners.\u201d He shrugged and picked up the last piece of meat with his fork.</p><p>\u201cI have to go.\u201d Kirishima almost threw down his cutlery, standing up with a screeching chair. Bakugou almost choked on his own spit and whipped his head around.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d He snapped. But Kirishima had already pushed the chair back far enough and took a step back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I am so, so sorry. I need to go. See you later, Baku\u2014Your Highness!\u201d And with that, he jolted around and started running. Bakugou wheezed. Not again. Kirishima would not ditch him again. With a sharp push, he stood up from his chair, on foot already planted firmly on the ground to give him leverage. He thrust forward only to collide with a servant who suddenly appeared from the side.</p><p>Bakugou toppled over with the person but could retain from falling down by rolling over his shoulder. The tray flew high up, falling down with a loud clatter, and dishes shattering on the ground. The servant held his side but was already kneeling down on both knees, head almost touching the ground.</p><p>\u201cI am incredibly sorry. Please, forgive me, Your Highness.\u201d Their voice quivered slightly and Bakugou clicked his tongue, growling under his breath. He punched the ground with his fist, flinching just barely at the pain.</p><p>Kirishima was gone. Fucking again.</p>",

That screams for stupid ideas. <br><b>A/N:</b> Collection of works for KiriBakuWeek 2019. First time writing KiriBaku, they deserve so much love. Ha.<br></p><p>You can read chapter 2 on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/18557164/chapters/44032582\" target=\"_blank\">AO3</a> if you want to! :)</p>[[MORE]]<p>In record time, Eijirou thought he never ran this fast, he sprinted down the small space between the barracks and the castle walls, shot through the next door inside the east wing and ran towards the servants\u2019 sleeping chambers. Fortunately for him, most servants were either occupied by the still ongoing banquet or were already in their rooms.</p><p>When he arrived at his door, he jerked it open and closed it immediately after he entered, leaning against the cold wood and catching his breath. His heart was still pounding against his rib cage, he thought it would crack through the bones.</p><p>\u201cEijirou!\u201d Mina jumped to her feet followed by Hanta, Denki nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Eijirou slowly slid down the door, huffing out a small whimper and buried his face in his knees. His friends were by his side right then, grabbing his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cW-what happen? You were gone for so long!\u201d Mina cried out, voice cracking with emotion.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re covered in dirt, what the hell?\u201d Hanta examined his attire, dusting off the slowly drying mud from his arms and shins.</p><p>\u201cSo many people\u2026 questions\u2026 prince\u2026 swords\u2026\u201d Eijirou pressed between tight lips. He grasped at his hair, groaning.</p><p>\u201cWhat?! Slow down, what happened?!\u201d Mina, slowly losing her patience, shook a little more insistent at his shoulder. Eijirou groaned again, trying to order his thoughts himself. Hanta, an angel in disguise, held Mina\u2019s arm and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cLet the man breathe, he just needs a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we don\u2019t have a minute!\u201d Mina countered. \u201cEijirou, are you being followed? Did the prince send someone after you?\u201d Eijirou shook his head against his knees and only then Mina allowed herself to calm down. She let go of his shoulder and sat down next to him, Hanta following her example, all three with their backs against the door.</p><p>Eijirou drew his breaths in and out, slowly regaining control of his emotions. He let go of his hair and leaned his head against the door, blinking at the ceiling as if he just realized where he was.</p><p>\u201cThere were-\u201c, his voice broke and he had to clear his throat, \u201cthere were so many people, asking me all this stuff we thought up in advance and at first everything was fine. I just wanted to eat something and then leave, that would be enough. I was so afraid some of the servants would recognize me.\u201d He groaned again just imagining that.</p><p>\u201cAnd then\u201d, he blinked, swallowing, \u201cthe prince was there. I was introduced. To the prince. As a noble. To the prince. Guys, I talked to the prince! The prince of this very kingdom. Me!\u201d His eyes sprung back and forth between Mina and Hanta, growing more and more erratic as he spoke.</p><p>Hanta put a hand on his shoulder to calm him down. \u201cDid he notice something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Eijirou inhaled. \u201cWe talked just a little bit, I think I offended him.\u201d He laughed dryly. \u201cI thought I was going to die right that moment, oh my god. And then, and then, the queen walked over. Guys, the queen!\u201d He buried his face again in his hands, shaking his head in disbelief that had really happened.</p><p>\u201cI panicked and ran. Just straight into the crowd. I wanted to leave but then those nobles came and, hell, I talked my mouth off, guys, I don\u2019t even remember anymore what I was rambling about. But they were laughing, that\u2019s good I guess.\u201d</p><p>Mina chuckled slightly. \u201cLeave it to Eijirou, the humble servant boy making the nobles laugh in the face of his own death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot funny!\u201d Eijirou wailed. \u201cBut then, the prince was there. Just, appeared out of nowhere, grabbed my arm and took me outside. I almost hugged him. I mean, I was so fucking terrified but I was finally outside. And then.\u201d Eijirou stared at the ground, tilting his head in thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2026 sparred?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d Hanta and Mina said in unison.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2026 He took some wooden swords, gave me one and then we fought? I don\u2019t know guys, that was so surreal I don\u2019t even know.\u201d He shrugged helplessly. \u201cFor like half an hour? Then he beat me, obviously, and said something about taking a bath and how filthy we are and that my hair looked almost black.\u201d He gestured vaguely at his hair that was, in fact, back to his original black color.</p><p>\u201cAnd then I bolted. Just straight away. And here I am.\u201d</p><p>Mina huffed out a breath, opening and closing her mouth, changing whatever she wanted to say every second.</p><p>\u201cAt least he doesn\u2019t know who you really are.\u201d Hanta said with a shrug. \u201cCould be worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorse? I insulted the prince and fought with him on equal terms! As if impersonating a noble wasn\u2019t bad enough, but behaving like that in front of the crown prince? I am a dead man walking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeez, drama queen, relax.\u201d Mina patted his shoulder with a little too much force, making him wince. \u201cI think, that was a successful evening.\u201d She grinned at him.</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d He raised his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cWell, you talked to nobles, ate their food, talked to the prince, who spent time with you alone\u201d, she wiggled her eyebrows at that, \u201cand nobody found out.\u201d She clapped her hands in conclusion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d, Eijirou sighed. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re not wrong. But I won\u2019t do that again. Ever.\u201d He huffed, crossing his arms.</p><p>Denki entered the chambers shortly after that conversation, or at least, tried to since they were all still sitting in front of the door, holding it close. He got a short recap of what transpired, made an equal conclusion as Mina and Eijirou just sighed in defeat. He let them believe, that this was a success but insisted that he won\u2019t do it again. He shoved the strange pot under his bed, hopefully forgetting about it soon enough.</p><p>The first two days were hell. Eijirou was so paranoid, he couldn\u2019t sleep, made simple mistakes at work and was just a total wreck. The third day was a lot better. He finally could sleep a few hours at a time and didn\u2019t jump at anyone who called him. On the fourth day, he accepted that nothing would happen. He was fine.</p><p>He sat in the kitchen on a low wooden stool, helping to peel the potatoes. A tedious, ungrateful work nobody liked doing, but Eijirou liked to rise to the occasion and took on the task. Half of the basket was peeled, half of them not. He craned his neck, rolling his shoulder with a loud crack and started on the next potato when he overheard the two cooks at the oven next to him.</p><p>\u201cAnother banquet next week? What are they thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, man. They decided yesterday and now we have to get all the ingredients in time. I think they don\u2019t understand this fucking job. We can\u2019t just make a list with everything we need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why another one so soon? Aren\u2019t they, like, just for show? Showing off their money and stuff like that?\u201d</p><p>As they spoke, Eijirou listened with half an ear, he didn\u2019t care about another banquet since it didn\u2019t concern him, a servant walked up and filled his tray with snacks. He chimed in without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cI heard it was a request by the prince himself.\u201d The cooks\u2019 head whipped around. \u201cNo kidding. Something about internal affairs or something like that. Strengthening the bond between their juris\u2026 jurisdi\u2026 the different regions within the kingdom.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI think they said something about inviting every noble family from the Chiba region.\u201d</p><p>Eijirou let his knife fall down, clattering loudly on the ground. He blinked and grabbed at it, apologizing under his breath. A cold sweat broke out on his back, his heartbeat increasing.</p><p>\u201cRumors have it he is looking for\u2026\u201d Eijirou slowly looked up to the servant, trying to hear better what he was saying and their eyes met.</p><p>\u201cYou!\u201d The servant inhaled sharply. Eijirou sprung to his feet, grabbed the servant by the collar and yanked him outside. The tray fell to the ground with a loud clatter, probably everyone looked up at the commotion but Eijirou was already out the door, pushing the servant inside a small broom closet. It was big enough for two people, but they still had to stay so close to each other their knees brushed.</p><p>\u201cWhat the-\u201c \u2013 \u201cShhh!\u201d Eijirou covered the servant\u2019s mouth with his hands, frantically shaking his head. The servant gave a slow nod and Eijirou lowered his hand.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, dude! You\u2019re the one\u2026 the one with the prince! You said thanks! I knew it, no noble could be that nice.\u201d He chuckled in disbelief while Eijirou was regretting every life choice he ever made, ticking off every option he had to survive this.</p><p>\u201cDude, chill! I won\u2019t tell on you!\u201d</p><p>Eijirou\u2019s eyes focused back on the other servant. \u201cYou won\u2019t?\u201d He croaked.</p><p>\u201cNo, man. That is just\u2026 wait, what exactly were you doing there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know, something like a bet and it went out of hand and ugh.\u201d Eijirou slapped a hand on his forehead.</p><p>\u201cI think the prince is looking for you.\u201d He bit his lip. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much you hear down here, but the prince and the mysterious red-haired noble are the talks of the castle! Like, everybody saw how you and the prince left together and he came back alone, raging. Geez, I mean, I knew how much a storm he could curse but that was from a higher level.\u201d He crossed his arm, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cAnd now he demanded another banquet, asking specifically for the nobles of the Chiba region, dude, he has it bad for you.\u201d A grin spread on his face and in every other situation he would be overjoyed at the sight of the same row of pointy teeth but right now, his ears were ringing.</p><p>\u201cWh\u2014No! We\u2026 we just\u2014\u201d He shook his head. \u201cWe were just talking and fighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFighting, huh?\u201d The servant wiggled his eyebrows at him. Before Eijirou could interject, the servant held up a hand. \u201cRelax, man. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t tell a single soul, promise. I\u2019m rooting for you, for whatever thing is happening between you and him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe is nothing happe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to, I can be your ears and eyes inside the castle.\u201d He nodded at himself. \u201cI let you know if I overhear more about this occasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2026 No, man, I mean, thanks. Thanks for not telling anybody and all that. But I don\u2019t\u2026 I\u2019m not doing that again.\u201d Eijirou shook his head. \u201cIf anybody else will find out, I\u2019m dead. Like, literally dead.\u201d</p><p>The servant rolled his head from one shoulder to the other and hummed. \u201cI get it.\u201d He nodded. \u201cOkay, I tell you what. Just listen, for now, okay?\u201d Eijirou nodded reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, everybody is talking about it. Like, all the servants that were present and even the personal maids from the prince. Something like he is nicer to them or something. I think, he really likes you. And like every servant has an easier time with him being not his usual grumpy self. So, I\u2019m totally rooting for you.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cMy suggestion is the following: I tell the other servants about you, just the ones who saw you at the banquet. You will attend the next banquet and we\u2019ll help you out. And then you two can live happily ever after. Or just have a nice evening, don\u2019t care. Just think of something that you can\u2019t see him again after that.\u201d</p><p>Eijirou was baffled. That was the most ridiculous, preposterous, ingenious idea if he ever heard one.</p><p>\u201cEveryone would be on board?\u201d His thoughts were running a mile a second. If he could attend one more banquet and somehow make a possible excuse that he won\u2019t come back ever again the prince would have to let this go and he would never live in fear again.</p><p>\u201cOf course! Like I said, we\u2019re rooting for you!\u201d He snapped his fingers right in front of their faces, remembering something. \u201cI\u2019m Tetsutetsu, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEijirou\u201d, Eijirou mumbled perplexed.</p><p>\u201cYou gave him your real name?\u201d Tetsutetsu raised an eyebrow at him but chuckled slightly at first, then louder. Eijirou had to cover his mouth again, shushing him.</p><p>\u201cSorry\u201d, Tetsutetsu whipped a happy tear away. \u201cThis is the best. I like you, man. You have balls.\u201d He nodded again, gripping at Eijirou\u2019s hand. \u201cYou in?\u201d</p><p>Eijirou\u2019s eyes darted around from Tetsutetsu\u2019s face to his hand to his grin. He inhaled deeply, grabbed his hand as tight as possible and nodded. \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><p>As soon as they left the broom closet and Tetsutetsu sprinted back to the kitchen, remembering that he was just in the middle of serving food, Eijirou took to his heels and ran the whole length of the east wing down the same corridor a few days ago and just kicked in the door to Denki\u2019s workplace.</p><p>\u201cWHA\u2013!\u201d Denki threw the small flask he had in his hand in the air startled and just barely caught it. \u201cWhat in the?!\u201d</p><p>His head whipped around and narrowed his eyes at Eijirou. \u201cDude, don\u2019t make me lose my job by destroying my ingredients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS-sorry.\u201d Eijirou stammered, honestly embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Denki chirped, already forgiving Eijirou. The latter sat down on the other wooden stool, sighing.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t believe this.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThere will be another banquet next week and I\u2019ll be attending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?!\u201d Denki sprung to his feet, hands on Eijirou\u2019s shoulders. A wide grin spreading over his face, he nodded enthusiastically. \u201cKnew you\u2019d come around. How come?\u201d</p><p>Eijirou briefly summarized his conversation with Tetsutetsu and their plan before he took a deep breath and stared at Denki, chewing on his lips. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is probably the worst and best plan I have ever heard!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought!\u201d</p><p>They burst into a small laughing fit, wheezing. Denki held his side, rubbing over his eyes. \u201cOkay, dude, we need to make a plan. We need\u201d, he fumbled over his desk, grabbing for some ink and paper and started scribbling as he spoke, \u201cMina needs to give you some more clothes, you can\u2019t wear the same from last time. We need to gather enough information about other families in Chiba, so you actually play a believing part to be from that jurisdiction. We need to maybe polish your overall appearance a little, like\u201d, he gestured a circle around Eijirou\u2019s face with his quill, \u201cmaybe some powder, new hairstyle.\u201d</p><p>Eijirou couldn\u2019t even close his mouth as Denki spoke. When did his friend became so proactive and even had some really good advice? He shook his head to bring himself back to the moment and then nodded. \u201cY-yeah, sounds good!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you have to learn to speak a little more proper!\u201d Denki actually chided but still grinning. \u201cThough, the prince seemed to like you nonetheless, so\u2026\u201d He trailed off, shrugging. \u201cI don\u2019t really know. Being yourself seemed to be the best course, I guess.\u201d</p><p>The next days were pure stress. Not only because every servant was involved in the preparations for the banquet since it was on such short notice. The chambers had to be prepared for the guests, clothes, tablecloths and draperies had to be washed, food had to be harvested and bought and hunted, dished had to be polished, the floors had to be mopped and so on. It was a little miracle, no one has dropped dead yet.</p><p>When it was only two days until the banquet, they had a little bit f time to breathe. Most of the tasks were fulfilled, there will be another rush the next day but for now, Eijirou could actually work on their other plan.</p><p>Mina had gathered some different garments while washing clothes, slowly piling it up. Eijirou didn\u2019t know how she could get away with it, but he suspected the other wash maiden had heard about his ordeal as well and helped out. In fact, probably everybody had heard about it by now, judging by all the knowing looks he got.</p><p>Tetsutetsu pulled him aside a few times to give an update, but nothing noteworthy has changed. Nobody has heard any other reason for the banquet to be held but the personal maids are still recounting pleasant encounters with the prince.</p><p>So, when Eijirou had the opportunity, he grabbed all the clothes Mina had gathered, shoved the mystical jug into his pocket and sneaked outside, up to the river stream. He knew Mina could help him a lot more but Eijirou wanted to try out some stuff himself. He had relied on his friends so much the last week, he wanted to lift some of their burdens.</p><p>He hid behind the trees next to the river, folded out his clothes and smeared some of the substance into his hair. It was strange how the pot never seemed to become emptier. But who was he to question some magical pot of hair dying substance?</p><p>The next step was to come up with an acceptable outfit with his limited choices and a new hairstyle.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>The two days after the banquet, Bakugou was just furious. Outstandingly furious. He snapped at everything and everyone, making them stay out of his way altogether. It was better for everyone involved. He was outraged, to be just ditched like that. What was Kirishima thinking who he was? He was just a lowly noble, just recently established and then he ditched him, the prince?</p><p>It was both infuriating and humiliating. He knew he wasn\u2019t the most amiable person to ever exist, but he thought that Kirishima didn\u2019t mind because, well, he didn\u2019t evade him because of it and could actually hold a conversation without licking the ground he was walking on. It was\u2026 nice. To talk to someone without being held to the standards of a prince, to just be a man.</p><p>Nevertheless, he ditched him. Just after they had the most exciting sparring fight he had in a long time. Did he do something wrong? Did he say something? Did he insult him by kicking him in the mud? It could be all three possibilities.</p><p>After he finally got himself out of his self-pity, Bakugou at first thought about just forgetting about Kirishima. They would probably never meet again. That was okay. He didn\u2019t need him. Then, when he was being dressed by his maids, Bakugou wasn\u2019t sure why but something Kirishima had said popped up in his head, he looked down at the maids, observing their movements, and asked:</p><p>\u201cShould I\u201d, the maids\u2019 heads jerked up in alarm as they heard him growling, \u201cstay differently, so you can reach better?\u201d He was one head and a half taller than them and they often had to stretch to their toes to reach his shoulder or even get a stool to stand on. The next few seconds were filled with silence, nobody moving, until Bakugou\u2019s face moved back into his usual scowl.</p><p>\u201cCould you\u201d, the maid behind his back quietly piped up, \u201chold up your arms, your Highness?\u201d</p><p>The other maids held their breaths, staring at Bakugou to see his reaction. He nodded sharply and held up his arms as he was asked. The maids exchanged some confused looks but didn\u2019t question his behavior. As they dressed him, the other maids started to request some simple posture changings which he did without complaining. Dressing took less time than usual.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He mumbled when they hurried out the room and they made their curtsies with small smiles to their faces. Huh.</p><p>The next day, he paid attention. To the waiting staff, the errand boys, the servants, the gardeners. And, as Kirishima said, no one paid them any mind, not even half a glance. They just did all the work without complaining, not one hurtful glare against someone who bumped into them or dirtied the hallway just a second after it was cleaned. Maybe, just maybe, there was some truth in what Kirishima had said.</p><p>The day after that, he walked inside the chambers of his mother first thing in the morning. He didn\u2019t care that the guards advised against just walking in without announcing himself but he ignored them in Bakugou-fashion. He kicked the door in without knocking, his mother jerking from her bed. His father kept on snoring next to her.</p><p>\u201cMother.\u201d He growled.</p><p>\u201cSon.\u201d His mother slowly rose, glaring at him. \u201cWhat could be so important for my precious son to wake his mother from her well-earned sleep in this manner?\u201d</p><p>Bakugou had to bite back some inappropriate remark, biting his lower lip. \u201cI want you to hold a banquet. For me.\u201d</p><p>Well, that stunned his mother to silence. \u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes, hard. She didn\u2019t have to make such deal out of it. Sure, he never ever asked for a social event he had to attend, especially not in his name.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. A banquet. Like the monthly thing. Just, make it for internal affairs. Reinforcing the friendship between the castle and the jurisdiction of the Chiba prefecture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInternal\u2014Katsuki, who are you?\u201d His mother grinned at him. \u201cOr is this about a certain red-haired man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014No!\u201d Bakugou spat. \u201cWhat the fuck, mom?\u201d He groaned. \u201cI actually act like the prince you always wanted and then you make it about something stupid like that? Just. Do it.\u201d His lips tightened in a straight line. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Mitsuki had to blink a few times to register what her son had just said. She knew when to push and when to just shut up, she was the one who raised him, after all.</p><p>\u201cSure thing, Katsuki.\u201d</p><p>Bakugou nodded and stormed out her sleeping chambers without saying anything else, seething. That took a lot of his energy. The next days were pretty similar to his usual routine. Classes, sparring, dinner, and lunch. However, since he actually paid attention to their personal, he saw the strained faces, the hectic in their movements and the hurried gestures. It probably wasn\u2019t easy to prepare such a huge banquet on such short notice.</p><p>Bakugou actually felt, what audacity his feelings had these days, guilty. Guilty for putting so much pressure on them on top of their usual workload. So, when he happened to overhear some of the servants talking about the menu, what kind of proteins they still needed, he asked them, if it would help if he hunted down a deer.</p><p>The looks he got were always like a punch to his gut. Was it really so strange to ask if they needed help? Well, yeah, he answered himself, he never did in the past 19 years he had lived here. Nor knew he about anybody else who did.</p><p>That was why he now was riding down the cobblestone path behind the castle walls towards the forest, the royal hunting grounds. The bow was fastened at his saddle for now until he arrived at the forest, a quiver on his belt. Even though there was some pressure of time, Bakugou was relieved to get out of the castle again. He steered his horse down from the paved way and rode towards the small river that streamed parallel to the path towards the forest.</p><p>His horse strode leisurely, not stopping but taking its time to walk through the high grass of the riverbed. Bakugou led his view drift into the distance, relaxing for the first time since a few days. A red do next to a cluster of trees drew its attention to him. He squinted and stopped his horse, one hand on the handle of his hunting knife. He silently cursed himself that he didn\u2019t bring his sword, but what good would a sword do at a hunt anyway?</p><p>After observing the red dot for a few seconds, Bakugou noticed it was moving just slightly back and forth to the river and back to the trees. It seemed human alright. With a swift motion, he got off his horse and gestured the horse to stay put. They knew each other for long enough so it understood. Bakugou drew his knife and silently sneaked up to the patch of trees, squatting down to get a better view through the branches. And what a view he got.</p><p>Kirishima only wore his pants, open at the front. His chest was bare, seeing the dark happy trail from the navel down and Bakugou could finally confirm that he was built. Like a wall. His hair was pulled back into a sloppy ponytail, a few strands framing his face. His mouth was pulled in a frown as he grabbed one of the shirts laying on the ground and put it on. Kirishima tucked the shirt in, tugging on it for good measure and walked towards the river to look at his reflection.</p><p>Bakugou felt his face heat up, his heart accelerating its beating. He wasn\u2019t a peeping tom so he put his knife away, stood up straight and cleared his throat.</p><p>Kirishima spun around so fast, he almost lost his footing, stumbling violently before catching himself and leveling his eyes on Bakugou. His cheeks rose in color ever so lightly, but Bakugou decided to ignore it for now.</p><p>\u201cY-Your Highness?\u201d Kirishima croaked, fumbling with his clothes, tugging at his hair, a nervous wreck some would say.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing here?\u201d Bakugou crossed his arms. Even if he was in no position to judge, this was still inside the castle walls, somewhere far away for people to see, so why would Kirishima sneak around to try on his clothes?</p><p>\u201cI- uhm\u201d, Kirishima stammered, slowly walking towards the shirts that were laying on the ground to obscure Bakugou\u2019s view on them, kicking at them with his heel to gather them up. Bakugou raised his eyebrow at that.</p><p>\u201cI was\u2026\u201d, Kirishima looked over his shoulder, biting so hard on his lip Bakugou thought it would draw blood and sighed in defeat. \u201cI was looking for something to wear for the banquet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming?\u201d Bakugou could just hope he didn\u2019t sound as eager as he felt.</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah\u201d, Kirishima shrugged. \u201cYour Highness invited all noble families of the Chiba jurisdiction, would be kinda impolite to not attend, I guess?\u201d The first smile from him finally stretched over his face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn right.\u201d Bakugou scoffed. Then his eyes drove over Kirishima, finally looking at the outfit Kirishima wore. \u201cThat looks fucking hideous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, really?\u201d Kirishima frowned, looking down at himself. \u201cI was pretty confident in this.\u201d Bakugou huffed a small laughter, covering it with a cough. With two big steps, he was right beside Kirishima who looked at him with big eyes. Trying to ignore his gaze on him, Bakugou eyed the different shirts, pants and the two vests. Not exactly the wardrobe of a noble.</p><p>\u201cWhy for fuck\u2019s sake are you dressing up in the middle of the royal castle walls?\u201d He grumbled. There was no heat in his words, he realized that himself already, just curiosity. Kirishima coughed, scratching his neck. He kneeled down to his shirts, pulling at their hems.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u201d, Kirishima bit his lips. Bakugou subconsciously filed it under a nervous tick. \u201cI don\u2019t have that much to choose from.\u201d He silently said, chuckling dryly. It didn\u2019t fit him. \u201cIt\u2019s not much and I have to dress myself. Something Your Highness probably isn\u2019t used to.\u201d A wink at him and Bakugou didn\u2019t know if his cheeks heated up in humiliation or embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d He huffed as he squatted down as well and earned a more earnest chuckle. \u201cAt least I know that this shirt\u201d, he jabbed a finger against Kirishima\u2019s firm chest, \u201cdoesn\u2019t fit your pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the pants are nice, aren\u2019t they?!\u201d Kirishima cried out in mocking despair.</p><p>\u201cThey are.\u201d Bakugou grunted. He pulled at some of the shirts, eyes going back and forth between the shirts and Kirishima\u2019s black pants until they settled on a white shirt with a puffy collar and sleeves. He grabbed it and hold it in front of Kirishima who eyed him curiously.</p><p>\u201cPut this on.\u201d He ordered, grabbing for one of the small vests. In the corner of his eye, he could see Kirishima undress before pulling the other shirt over his head. His eyes darted down at his chest for just a second before staring back at the vest in his hands.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Kirishima tugged the hem into his pants, fastening the cords at the frills of his sleeves. Bakugou helped him with his left sleeve and threw the vest in his face. Kirishima chuckled and tucked his arms through the open sleeve holes, butting it up. There were just three buttons, ending just shy under the poof of his collar, accentuating his broad chest just a little more.</p><p>\u201cDo I\u2026 Does it look good?\u201d Kirishima smiled shyly at him, doing things to his gut. Bakugou nodded once before Kirishima trotted over to the water, examining his reflection. Seemingly pleased, he offered Bakugou a wide grin.</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d He beamed at him. Huh, it actually feels nice to hear a thank you for something he did.</p><p>\u201cYou still didn\u2019t answer why the fuck you\u2019re inside the walls.\u201d Bakugou growled. \u201cNobody in his right mind would sneak up inside just to play dress up.\u201d</p><p>Kirishima looked caught, fumbling with his sleeves. His eyes darted around, looking everywhere but at Bakugou.</p><p>\u201cStop stalling. Just fucking tell me.\u201d He snapped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d, Kirishima sighed, \u201cI mean no harm, I promise. I can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t tell you, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Bakugou\u2019s eyes narrowed down at him but couldn\u2019t find any sign that indicated he was lying or wanted to deceive him in any way. He scoffed.</p><p>\u201cSuit your-fucking-self.\u201d</p><p>Kirishima threw him another apologetic smile. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>An awkward silence stretched between them, making both of them uncomfortable. Bakugou glared at the ground, stuffing down the slight pricking feeling in his chest.</p><p>\u201cSo\u201d, Kirishima walked up to him, \u201cwhat are you doing here?\u201d Bakugou threw a glance over his shoulder to see his horse grassing right where he left him.</p><p>\u201cOn my way to hunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Kirishima exclaimed, clapping his hands. \u201cFor the banquet?\u201d He nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnything in particular? Deer? Boar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeer. Probably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm\u201d, Kirishima hummed. \u201cI wonder how it\u2019ll taste?\u201d he mumbled. Bakugou wasn\u2019t sure if it was meant for him to hear but he huffed, nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cLike fucking deer. I don\u2019t think deer tastes differently in other prefectures.\u201d Kirishima threw him an unreadable glance.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m gonna find out anyway, huh?\u201d Kirishima smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cYou want to come with me?\u201d They blinked at each other before Bakugou\u2019s brain caught up with his mouth. He coughed, taking a step back.</p><p>\u201cForget tha\u2014\u201c \u2013 \u201cSure.\u201d They spoke at the same time. Bakugou\u2019s gaze shot up, meeting Kirishima\u2019s, cheeks slightly reddened.</p><p>\u201cAh, but I don\u2019t really know how to hunt, so I won\u2019t be of any help.\u201d Kirishima scratched his cheek. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Bakugou huffed. \u201cI\u2019m more than capable enough. Just don\u2019t scare it away.\u201d He turned around on his heels, not looking if Kirishima followed him, only hearing his footsteps falling in line behind him. He took the reins of his horse again when they reached it and climbed into his saddle again. He stepped out of the stirrup iron on Kirishima\u2019s side and threw him an awaiting glance.</p><p>Kirishima hesitated only for a second, taking a step forward and grabbing the hand Bakugou offered. It was warm. Kirishima put one foot in the stirrup and with a little effort, Bakugou pulled him up. Kirishima slid behind him in his saddle, his back flushed against Kirishima\u2019s chest. He hoped Kirishima wouldn\u2019t notice how hard his heart was hammering in his chest.</p><p>Bakugou steered his horse back on track and silently they rode towards the forest. Kirishima\u2019s breath tickled against his neck, sometimes his ear whenever he turned his head to look around, gasping voiceless at the view or an animal or whatever he deemed interesting. Bakugou tried really hard to focus on his environment, but that proved really hard with Kirishima literally all around him. His breath and voice surrounding his head, his arms pulled lightly around his waist, their torso\u2019s and thighs pressed against each other.</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d Kirishima mumbled softly into his ear. Bakugou could feel the tips of his ears burn, just where he felt Kirishima\u2019s breath. He pointed carefully between two trees and when Bakugou followed his line of sight, he saw a deer, antlers growing high above his head.</p><p>Ever so slowly, Bakugou reached for his bow, stroking over Kirishima\u2019s thigh with the motion, pulling out an arrow with his other hand. His motions were slow but without hesitation, assertive. He drew his arrow, aimed with one eye closed, feeling Kirishima\u2019s chest rising against his back. Their breathing was in synch, he felt Kirishima exhaling by his chest flattening and let go of his arrow.</p><p>The arrowhead shot through the branches right above the deer\u2019s front legs through his ribs, killing it instantly. Kirishima gasped again.</p><p>\u201cAmazing.\u201d His grip tightened around Bakugou\u2019s waist.</p><p>\u201cI fucking know\u201d, he grumbled more out of reflex. He fastened his bow back on the saddle and galloped over to their prey. He slid down from the saddle, landing on the ground with a soft thud and kneed down. Pulling out his knife, he heard Kirishima land behind him, and slit his knife through the deer\u2019s throat to let it bleed out.</p><p>\u201cWe let it bleed out and then the kitchen staff will take care of the rest.\u201d He explained without being asked to, seeing Kirishima nod next to him.</p><p>\u201cYou never skin and gut it yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No. It\u2019s all dirty and gross.\u201d</p><p>Kirishima laughed airily. \u201cWell, I think, if you want to eat something you have to go through the whole process.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you never fucking hunted yourself. So, you don\u2019t actually deserve to eat deer yourself.\u201d Bakugou shot back. Kirishima didn\u2019t say anything, just held his hand open for the knife. Groaning at himself, finally catching up what was going on, he handed Kirishima the knife. For someone who was praised to be a genius he sometimes was a little dense.</p><p>\u201cYou never ate deer before.\u201d He answered himself quietly. Kirishima hummed and began to hold up the knife before stopping.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d Bakugou rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cMy clothes!\u201d Kirishima put the knife down and stripped off his vest and shirt with deft fingers. His skin was slightly flushed as he kneeled back down, grabbing for the knife again. He set the knife at the bottom of the deer\u2019s throat, Bakugou could see Kirishima\u2019s muscles tense up as he pulled the knife from left to right in one firm stroke.</p><p>Immediately, all innards fell out. Fortunately, it already bled out enough from its throat so not too much blood came out through the cut. Kirishima wiped the Knife on the grass to get the excess blood off from it and then grabbed at intestines and stomach and whatnot. He just grabbed it with his bare hands. Bakugou stared at him as if he wasn\u2019t human.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026 you just do that?\u201d</p><p>Kirishima blinked at him. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause\u2014\u201d Bakugou stopped himself. Because it\u2019s the servants\u2019 job, was what he wanted to say but knowing Kirishima well enough, he would insult him with this thinking. He nodded, took a deep breath and watched Kirishima gutting the deer. After a short while, Kirishima began to explain what he was doing. He couldn\u2019t name much of the anatomy of the deer, Bakugou filled these blanks, but had extensive knowledge about the right procedure to prepare a deer to be cooked.</p><p>It took them about half an hour to get all its intestines properly wrapped up, another half an hour to skin it, and then strapped the deer on the back of Bakugou\u2019s horse. They opted to walk beside the horse, Kirishima said to have an eye on the deer so it wouldn\u2019t slide down but Bakugou understood that he didn\u2019t want to strain his horse too much with two grown men and a deer on its back. No way, he would ride then.</p><p>Bakugou had taken Kirishima\u2019s clothes and held onto it for now since Kirishima\u2019s arms were still dipped in blood right up to his elbows. After exiting the forest, Bakugou steered them back to the river and Kirishima could wash his arms. When he emerged from the water and strutted over to him, asking silently for his clothes, Bakugou had to force himself to give it back to him, he had to admit.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Ba- Your Highness.\u201d Kirishima snapped his eyes to the ground as he stumbled over his words, pulling the shirt over his head. Bakugou squinted his eyes at him but let it slide. He crossed his arms and waited.</p><p>\u201cNo, really, thank you.\u201d Kirishima said again. \u201cFor, you know, taking me with you and\u201d, he gestured at himself, \u201chelping me out.\u201d</p><p>Bakugou huffed and pulled himself back into the saddle. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>Kirishima beamed at him. \u201cSee you at the banquet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better will.\u201d He steered his horse back to the cobbled path, hitting its flanks with his heels and galloped back to the castle before he could look back.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Eijirou stood at the river as long as he could see the prince ride away. At the same time, he wished for Bakugou to turn around and to just ride away as fast as he could. Bakugou took the decision from him as he galloped away. He let out a breath he didn\u2019t know he held in.</p><p>He squatted down, hands to his face a made a noise between a squeal and a giggle. No, this couldn\u2019t be happening. No. Nope. Eijirou walked up to the patch of trees, grabbed all the clothes and, finally, ran all the way back. He already took long enough as it was. He ignored all the looks he got and was relieved he could say his red face was because of the running.</p><p>He slid into his chamber and stuffed the clothes under his bed, changing out of his current outfit. He put on his simple linen clothing, pulled his headband around his red hair and ran all the way back to the kitchen and asked for something, anything to do. He needed to be distracted.</p><p>After tackling every possible assignment, Eijirou made his way back to their chambers when it was already late. He stumbled into the room, trying to be as quiet as possible but as soon as the door swung open, his friends were on their feet, lighting a candle.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?!\u201d They all whispered loudly in unison.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Kirishima stuttered. His brain provided him instantly with his memories of today\u2019s afternoon, Bakugou\u2019s eyes constantly roaming over his own naked chest, his body pressed against him, brushing against each other with every step the horse had taken. His face flushed unbelievable hot.</p><p>\u201cYou met the prince, haven\u2019t you?\u201d Mina gave him a knowing look, receiving nothing but a nod in confirmation. His friends high fived each other.</p><p>\u201cGuys\u201d, Eijirou whined, \u201cthat\u2019s not something to celebrate. I will only meet him once again and then never again. This just makes everything\u201d, he huffed in annoyance, \u201cmore complicated.\u201d</p><p>His friends followed him with his eyes as he prepared for bed, exchanging glanced.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Denki asked.</p><p>Eijirou\u2019s shoulders tensed before falling down. \u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s talk hypothetically.\u201d He sat down on his bed, his friends following suit. \u201cHypothetically, I like him. And he liked me. We met at the banquet, becoming even better friends. Yeah, well, surprise I have to move to another country, so see you never again.\u201d He groaned. \u201cThis will just\u2026 suck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if you just, I don\u2019t know, play along for a little longer?\u201d Mina asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cDeceiving him? Playing someone, I am not? Yeah, great. And either it will suck even more when we have to stop seeing each other or he\u2019ll find out eventually and take it upon himself to stab me to death. I don\u2019t want to\u2026\u201d, he clenched his jaw, \u201cI don\u2019t want to lie to him anymore. I mean, hypothetically, if I liked him, lying to the person you like is just not right.\u201d Eijirou fell backward onto his pillow, both arms spread to his sides, bumping against the wall with his knuckles.</p><p>\u201cJust two more days.\u201d He mumbled into the almost darkness. His friends stayed silent. There wasn\u2019t anything they could say because deep down, they knew Eijirou was right. There was no possible solution that a prince and a servant could ever be friends, let alone anything else.</p><p>Eijirou tried not to think about the upcoming banquet too hard for the next days but that was kind of impossible since every waking second he was reminded that it was happening due to all the assignments their wing was flooded with. The day before the banquet was especially brutal. Some of the guests had already arrived and demanded attention on top of preparing for the event. Eijirou still was grateful, working and running around at least occupied his brain well enough to actually think about that he would be attending as well.</p><p>Well, until it was finally was the day of the banquet. His thoughts caught up with the impending task at hand and made him jittery. His hands trembled, his mind wandered. What he couldn\u2019t really grasp was, was it just anticipation acting as a noble or did he, as a matter of fact, not want to part ways with the prince? He didn\u2019t know and, to be honest, he didn\u2019t want to know.</p><p>When it was finally time to get ready, all the other servants ushered him out of the kitchen, encouraging to do whatever he wanted, with a wink, that they could handle the rest. With a heavy sigh, he left for his chambers where Mina was already waiting for him.</p><p>\u201cWow, you look like you\u2019re on the way to a funeral.\u201d She smacked his back. \u201cCheer up, you\u2019re gonna see your prince tonight.\u201d She chuckled with a knowing look.</p><p>\u201cHe is not my prince\u201d, he grumbled in response but, oh no, did he want him to be his? Shaking his head, he banished the thought as soon as it came up and pulled out the clothes he prepared for tonight. Mina helped him dress, to give a few knowing tucks so it framed his body just the right way.</p><p>Eijirou had already smeared some of the substance into his air before he went to bed last night, not entirely sure how much time he would have for getting ready. Turned out, enough time.</p><p>\u201cSit\u201d, Mina ushered him to sit on the floor in front of the bed, sitting down behind him. She brushed his hair with a broken comb and started to part his hair. Slowly she started to braid different wisps of hair on the side until it united in the middle of the back of his head and became one thicker braided tail, which was slightly raised with a black bow. The end of the ponytail was fastened with a thin black strand.</p><p>Eijirou carefully drove his hand over his hair, feeling the tight strands and when Mina handed him her mirror, he let out a tiny gasp.</p><p>\u201cMina!\u201d He turned his head from one side to the other, a few shorter strands on his forehead bobbing with the motion, and his smile grew. \u201cThat looks amazing! Thank you!\u201d He turned around fully and pulled her in a firm embrace. Mina laughed into his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not difficult to make a pretty person pretty.\u201d She tightened her hold for a second before they both let go. \u201cEijirou\u201d, she tugged at his frilly collar, stroking over his vest.</p><p>\u201cI want you to know, that we will be on your side. Whatever will happen, whatever your decision will be.\u201d</p><p>Eijirou nodded, trying not to cry on the spot. Mina patted his cheek. \u201cYou still have time to cry. As soon as I\u2019m finished with you I won\u2019t let you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMina!\u201d Eijirou wailed, again, pressing his face into her chest. She patted his hair and hushed him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, took in a deep breath and sat up again. \u201cAlright.\u201d Mina grabbed some of the make-up utensils she could gather over the span of last week with the help of other maids and started to apply some powder on his cheeks, drew a fine line on the wing of his eyelids with charcoal and dabbed some red substance onto his lips, making them even rosier than they were anyway.</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d Mina admired her own work.</p><p>Eijirou took his time to mentally prepare himself, just staring at the wall of their chamber, Mina at his side, holding his hand. They went through the plan often enough he could recite it by heart. In hindsight, he was grateful for Tetsutetsu to get all the other servants on board with this over the top stupid plan. It took some pressure off his shoulder, especially, since the servant who was announcing the guests was as excited as everybody else and could play the part, so he didn\u2019t have to sneak in again. Particularly, because this is an event hosted for his apparent home prefecture and it would seem pretty odd that he had to sneak in for that.</p><p>Come in, eat and drink something, tell Bakugou he needed to leave the country because he was promised some young maiden in a far away state and then leave. Easy enough.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Bakugou was in high spirit in the past few days. High spirit meant, he didn\u2019t snap at everything and some of his heat left his voice, but rarely someone noticed. Still, Bakugou could feel a little change in his mood. Was it because of the little trip with Kirishima? Probably. But he wouldn\u2019t admit to that out loud.</p><p>He noticed a difference in how he was treated by the servants as well as much as he treated them differently. Not that he thanked them for everything they did, it was still their job, but he at least acknowledged their existence, gave them a short nod when, for example, one of them brought him a snack or he saw maids dusting off the busts in the hallway. Which made them a little less\u2026 afraid of him, Bakugou dared to say. He didn\u2019t think it was bad to be afraid of him, it meant respect. But somehow, being asked by his staff if he liked his tea rather with one or two spoons of sugar instead of just needed to be told how he wanted it, felt something akin to trust to him.</p><p>Trust with the people he wanted to lead.</p><p>\u201cDid something good happen, Your Highness?\u201d</p><p>Aizawa pulled him out of thoughts. He didn\u2019t listen for the past few minutes, he assumed. Blinking the thoughts away, Bakugou wore his usual scowl etched on his face.</p><p>\u201cThe fuck you want?\u201d</p><p>Unfazed, Aizawa turned back two pages and sighed. \u201cJust asking. I thought for a second there, you were smiling. Must be a trick of my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn sure it was.\u201d Bakugou snapped but turned his face down to the desk. Just in case. There was no way, such stupid, sappy thoughts would make him smile. Fortunately for him, Aizawa didn\u2019t care much about his current mental state and continued or rather repeated his lecture about the Chiba prefecture. Bakugou was making sure he knew about each and everything of the regions so he could host the best banquet they had ever attended.</p><p>Time flew by, the day filled with his usual routine of lecture, lunch, greeting some of the early guests and getting ready for the banquet. He noticed as the maids dressed him that they were a little more fidgeting, suppressed smiles here and there. He didn\u2019t stoop so low as to ask what was that all about even if his curiosity was stretched to its limit. Instead, he looked at his reflection in the wide mirror, tucking at his collar and sleeves to make himself more comfortable, and thought about someone he might, he better be, meet this evening.</p><p>Kirishima was a mystery to him. Starting by his appearance, what noble did have red hair? And it looked natural, he couldn\u2019t really be at fault but he could try to get some hair masks or whatever, so it wouldn\u2019t be that red. But it matched his eye color which was satisfying. And of course, the main reason he was such a mystery was his demeanor toward nobility. There was leisure in his speech, his gestures, his being he wasn\u2019t used to in a noble. Which was refreshing. He felt like talking to a human being and not someone who recited the usual pleasantries. Especially, he felt he could talk to him freely. Because or Kirishima\u2019s leisure he didn\u2019t feel like Kirishima forced himself to speak with him or to kiss his ass, just, he was honest.</p><p>He wanted to know the secrets Kirishima harbored. There was something he didn\u2019t tell him, obviously, and it felt like a challenge. Was he worthy enough to encode this enigma called Kirishima Eijirou?</p><p>His feet brought him to the ballroom, he nodded toward the servants opening the door and received small bows, and entered the room which was slowly filled with attendees. Automatically, his eyes scanned the crowd for a specific redhead but didn\u2019t find anything. He tried to ignore the disappointment in his chest. Taking in a deep breath he made his way to the side of his mother, greeting everyone who stopped him.</p><p>Whenever the door opened, his head jerked up, squinting at the people coming in and whenever it was not a specific red-haired man, his scowl grew deeper.</p><p>\u201cWhat made you so peeved, my dear son?\u201d His mother nudged him with her elbow, pushing it deep between his ribs and he suppressed a wince.</p><p>\u201cShut up. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHum.\u201d She hummed, grin growing a little wider, a little wickeder. \u201cAwaiting someone?\u201d Bakugou narrowed his eyes on her and clicked his tongue.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I? Just waiting for everybody to arrive to eat, I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure, you aren\u2019t thirsty?\u201d</p><p>Bakugou chocked on his own spit and spun around. \u201cMother\u2014\u201d but before he could finish his sentence, the door opened again and his ears heard the quiet announcement.</p><p>\u201cSir Kirishima Eijirou, first and only son of Lady Kirishima Tomoya.\u201d</p><p>Bakugou\u2019s voice died in his throat as he looked up to Kirishima walking through the doors, wearing the outfit he put together for him and an elaborate hairstyle. Maybe it was the chandelier or the lightning overall but to him, it looked like Kirishima was glowing.</p><p>He didn\u2019t hear what his mother said to him, just walking right up to Kirishima who was already getting attention by other bystanders. He pushed through them until he was right in front of him.</p><p>\u201cFinally decided to show up, dumbwhit?\u201d He crossed his arms, taking a quick once over glance at Kirishima before settling on the small smile that appeared on his face.</p><p>\u201cAw, did Your Highness miss me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fucking wish.\u201d His fist shot out against the other\u2019s shoulder earning a small grunt, but it turned into a chuckle. Kirishima rubbed at his shoulder and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNeed \u00a0to work on my reflexes so I can kick you\u2019re a\u2014to win fair and square.\u201d He coughed and scratched his cheek.</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck do you think I care about your wording?\u201d As if caught, Kirishima\u2019s eyes shot open, blinking.</p><p>\u201cUh, I\u2026\u201d, his hand traveled to his neck, rubbing at it, \u201cI mean, you\u2019re still the prince and I\u2019m far beneath you, so\u201d, he shrugged as he trailed off, eyes looking up at him sheepishly. \u201cDo you\u2026 don\u2019t want me to?\u201d</p><p>Bakugou glared at him with a small grunt and shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s whatever. I don\u2019t care.\u201d Kirishima hummed, leaning over a little.</p><p>\u201cThen, Your Highness, please let me kick your ass next time we spar.\u201d Bakugou\u2019s eyes narrowed down on Kirishima\u2019s beaming smile and shoved his shoulder at him.</p><p>\u201cBig words for someone who couldn\u2019t even get one hit in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI almost had you\u2026 that one time, I think.\u201d</p><p>Bakugou chuckled ever so lightly at the contemplating look on Kirishima\u2019s face. \u201cYou and thinking? I highly doubt that.\u201d When their eyes locked, his heart stuttered for just a second when he saw the tiny, yet warm smile meant for him.</p><p>\u201cSo, you do can laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off!\u201d Bakugou shoved at him again but Kirishima was laughing wholeheartedly already.</p><p>For the next hour, they kept on bantering, trying to one-up each other for their next sparring session and walked around the room. Bakugou had to stop every now and then to hold an obliging conversation with which he really could live without. His eyes always trailed off to his side, where Kirishima was apparently glued to him, never really leaving him but not chiming in in the conversation. Afterward, when they were alone again, Bakugou listed off some trivial information of the noble they were talking to. Not to impress Kirishima or anything.</p><p>Then, a small bell was rung, and his mother invited their guests to join her at the dinner table. Bakugou made a face and lead Kirishima to the table, scanning it for Kirishima\u2019s name badge and was pleasantly surprised to find him seated directly at his side. Whoever decided their seating order needed to be thanked. He almost pulled out the chair to offer it to Kirishima but could stop himself in time. Instead, he sat down on his own chair, registering by the movement next to him that Kirishima sat down as well.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what will be served?\u201d Kirishima leaned in and whispered to Bakugou. He just shrugged.</p><p>\u201cProbably the same as always. Soup, fish, meat, dessert.\u201d Pushing his lips up a little higher in a scowl. \u201cAlways the same.\u201d</p><p>Kirishima tilted his head at that. \u201cYou\u2026 don\u2019t like having four different courses?\u201d Bakugou rolled his eyes and groaned.</p><p>\u201cNo, Shitty-shima, I don\u2019t like having the same four courses every damn day. I thought we have top chefs who like to experiment and give us something to look forward to and not this bland shit, every day.\u201d</p><p>His mother cleared her throat and shot him a meaningful glare which he answered in the same manner. She rolled her eyes and stood up, all conversations died down.</p><p>\u201cMy honored guests, it is my pleasure to welcome you at our home.\u201d She raised her glass. \u201cIt is not only a joy for me to see you come from a faraway place to strengthen our bonds but, as well, that my son takes it upon himself to fight for these bonds.\u201d</p><p>He scuffed under his breath but Kirishima nudged his knee under the table, nodding at him with a smile.</p><p>\u201cSo, thank you, my dear son, Katsuki, to present us this opportunity. Would you like to say something yourself to our guests?\u201d</p><p>\u2018No\u2019 was the first thing he wanted to say but clenched his jaw to not blurt it out. His eyes found Kirishima\u2019s and he sighed. He stood up with a glass in his hand, looking them all over once.</p><p>\u201cThank you for following my invitation when I reached out for you. It is a great honor to have you all assembled in these halls and I hope to nourish our relationship with newly found friends and allies.\u201d His expression turned a little sour. He hated speaking as if he had a stick up his ass. \u201cThen, let\u2019s toast to our friends and eat to our heart\u2019s desire, I\u2019m fucking starving.\u201d He down his glass and sat down.</p><p>Kirishima was the first to break the stunned silence with a laugh and the others followed suit. Pleased by himself, Bakugou gave his mother a courteous nod who in turn fixed him with a knowing look in her eyes, dancing between him and Kirishima. He chose to ignore that and turned his attention back to Kirishima who was beaming at the soup that was brought in.</p><p>\u201cThat looks delicious!\u201d He gasped as a bowl was put in front of him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fucking soup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, Your Highness, even \u2018fucking soup\u2019 can taste pretty good!\u201d Kirishima mimicked his words with the same grumpy expression, Bakugou assumed he was wearing right now and kicked Kirishima under the table, earning a snicker.</p><p>It was fascinating to watch Kirishima eat a simple potato soup as if it was some blessed meal. His face beamed with every spoonful, humming every other bite and when he wiped his bowl clean with the slice of bread, it was pure bliss on his face. It was fucking soup. And yet, it made Bakugou enjoy his own soup a little more, admitting that it, in fact, did taste pretty good.</p><p>When the fish was served, Bakugou witnessed a rather peculiar situation. He was just quipping back in forth with his parents, when he out of the corner of his eye saw that Kirishima was grabbing for the wrong knife regarding eating fish. When he was about to say something, Kirishima locked eyes with the servant on the other side of the table. They shook their head so lightly, it was only visible if you look for it. Kirishima then moved his hand to the next, another shake and when he touched the right knife, he got a nod. They exchanged a subtle smile and the servant was gone.</p><p>As if nothing had happened, Kirishima turned back to Bakugou, grinning at him.</p><p>\u201cDo you know which fish will be served?\u201d</p><p>Still a little dumbfounded what he just witnessed, Bakugou shook his head. \u201cFish.\u201d He deadpanned. Kirishima chuckled at him.</p><p>\u201cI sure hope it is fish since it is the fish course. Man\u201d, his eyes grew distant, \u201cif that\u2019s all it takes to be a prince, I have a pretty good chance to become one myself.\u201d</p><p>That earned him, at the same time, a hard kick under the table and a chuckle from the queen. Kirishima\u2019s quiet yelp was accompanied by his flashing cheeks as he shot a glance towards the queen. A shy smile formed on his lips.</p><p>\u201cThis is Sir Kirishima Eijirou from whom I\u2019ve heard a lot recently, isn\u2019t he?\u201d The queen asked between bites.</p><p>\u201cY-yes, Your Majesty.\u201d Kirishima bowed his head slightly and Bakugou could see him fumble, apparently undecided if he was allowed to continue eating or waiting for some conversation. He rolled his eyes and nudged his knee, nodding at his fish. Relief washed over Kirishima as he took the next bite.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen Katsuki hold such a long conversation in a long time without chasing the other party away. What\u2019s your secret?\u201d</p><p>Kirishima snorted slightly but shook his head. \u201cNo secret, Your Majesty. Just honest\u2026 I like the way he is.\u201d Another smile, almost fond, formed on his lips and a bit of fish fell from Bakugou\u2019s fork as he stopped it right before his mouth. Ignoring the heat forming on his cheeks he bit down hard on his fork.</p><p>His mother just laughed. \u201cOh, dear Sir, that is truly fascinating. Do tell, what is it you like about my son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother!\u201d Bakugou almost shouted, heads turning to see what the commotion was about. Bakugou glared at his mother, having a silent conversation with his eyes alone. Which Mitsuki choose to ignore.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Katsuki? I just thought it was nice to know about redeeming qualities you have I\u2019m not aware of.\u201d Her smile stretched on his face, every inch of it smug.</p><p>\u201cOh, is it so hard to believe someone likes the son you raised? That is really reassuring.\u201d Bakugou snapped with fake hurt, lashing his anger out on his fish. The queen waited for another second before bursting out in a fit of laughter, dispersing the heavy atmosphere that had formed. Bakugou grumbled.</p><p>Kirishima touched his elbow with his own, searching for his eyes. He glanced over, pursing his lips. Slightly leaning forward, Kirishima held their gaze and whispered.</p><p>\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I like how determined you are, among other things.\u201d He had the audacity to wink at him. Bakugou felt another wave of heat rising up his face but also in his chest, tightening around his lungs. He grunted in response.</p><p>When they were finished with the fish, Kirishima leaned over again. His eyes were cast down, his fingers twitching at his napkin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014Can we talk after dinner? There is something I have to tell you.\u201d</p><p>Bakugou\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhy not tell me fucking now?\u201d</p><p>Kirishima shook his head, a sad smile on his lips he didn\u2019t like one bit. \u201cWe should talk\u2026 in private.\u201d Bakugou rolled his eyes but nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Whatever, indeed. It wasn\u2019t important that his heart clenched by the sorrowful look Kirishima wore or that he held his breath when he thought about what Kirishima had to tell him in private.</p><p>When the meat course was served, his mother raised her glass again. \u201cI want to thank my son since he was the one who shot the deer for us today.\u201d</p><p>Quiet \u2018oh\u2019s and \u2018ah\u2019s were uttered.</p><p>\u201cKirishima helped.\u201d Bakugou grumbled. His mother raised her eyebrows, tilting her head.</p><p>\u201cOh? I wasn\u2019t aware of that. Of course, thank you, Sir Kirishima, as well. How come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Kirishima\u2019s eyes widened and Bakugou saw him looking over to him in search for help.</p><p>\u201cWe just kinda ran into each other. And since I was on my way I just invited him to tag along. He was the one who\u2014\u201d Kirishima stepped on his foot and shook his head almost undetectable. Bakugou stumbled a little over his words and glared at him.</p><p>\u201cWe both took it down.\u201d He said in the end. His mother nodded again, forming polite conversation with the person next to his father, throwing Bakugou a meaningful look. But Bakugou had already turned his head to Kirishima.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck was that about?\u201d He hissed. Kirishima shrugged at him noncommittally.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want people to know.\u201d It was rather formed a question as he raised his voice at the end. Bakugou pinched his nose with two fingers, taking a few deep breaths. Why in the world was he keeping up with this? There was no logical reason and he was well aware of that fact, making it even more frustrating to him. Glancing back to Kirishima and seeing him savoring the meat, however, he decided it didn\u2019t matter really that much that he knew why.</p><p>\u201cAre all banquets like that?\u201d Kirishima asked in between bites.</p><p>Bakugou finally started eating as well. \u201cMostly. It\u2019s literally a banquet, dumbass.\u201d He scowled at Kirishima\u2019s chuckle. \u201cSometimes there are dances, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDances?\u201d Kirishima beamed at him. \u201cAw, man, that would have been great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, you like dances?\u201d Bakugou perked one eyebrow up. \u201cDon\u2019t look like one to dance.\u201d</p><p>Kirishima shrugged. \u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t actually. I mean, I don\u2019t know how\u201d, lowering his voice Kirishima poked at his meat, \u201cbut I wanted to attend a formal dance for so long, you know. Preferable after I learned how to dance.\u201d Another chuckle.</p><p>Bakugou eyed him for a second, an idea forming inside his head and before he could stop himself, he said: \u201cI could teach you.\u201d</p><p>Kirishima\u2019s head jerked up, staring at him with glistening eyes. \u201cYou would?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIdiot\u201d, Bakugou cleared his throat, chewing the rest of his meat in his mouth, \u201cthat\u2019s what I said, didn\u2019t I?\u201d He fixed his eyes back on the plate since he couldn\u2019t bear looking further at Kirishima\u2019s blinding smile. A few seconds went by without Kirishima answering so he chanced another glance.</p><p>Kirishima separated the vegetables from his meat with his fork, poking at it absentmindedly. His smile was already dropped and Bakugou felt his chest tighten, again. Should he see his physician about this?</p><p>\u201cGot a problem with that?\u201d he snapped instead.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Kirishima blinked up at him. \u201cNo! No, not at all. It\u2019s just\u2026\u201d he bit his lip, avoiding his gaze. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you later, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with all that\u2014\u201d \u2013 \u201cSo, Sir Kirishima\u201d, his mother interrupted him mid-sentence and he had to count from 10 backward to no yell at her.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t your mother come to join us today? I would have thought, she would be delighted as a recently declared Lady?\u201d She took a long sip, fixing Kirishima in his seat with her eyes.</p><p>\u201cY-yes, Your Majesty.\u201d Kirishima voice sounded raspy. \u201cShe extends her thanks for the invitation, however, she couldn\u2019t make it because of her health.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear. I hope she will get better soon.\u201d Bakugou\u2019s mother held a hand to her chest, shaking her head. \u201cI hope she can join us for the next banquet. I\u2019d like to meet the woman who raised such a good boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo see how it\u2019s actually done?\u201d Bakugou finally quipped. He wasn\u2019t to let it slide that she kept interrupting him and made a fool out of him. His mother shot him a glare.</p><p>\u201cFor you to see how to treat a mother right, my dear son.\u201d</p><p>He heard Kirishima stifle a laugh next to him, so he jerked his head around. \u201cYou fucker like laughing about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no\u201d, he grinned, holding a hand up in front of his mouth, \u201cit\u2019s just\u2026 I\u2019m happy to see you\u2019re having such a good relationship with your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWha\u2014Where did you get that idea from?!\u201d Bakugou blinked at him incredulously. Kirishima leaned back against his chair, humming.</p><p>\u201cWell, you can only really banter like this with someone you actually care about, don\u2019t you?\u201d A fond smile spread over his face. Did he wear make-up? Bakugou noticed the thin black line on his eyelid, giving his eyes a more edged shape. And before, he thought Kirishima looked a little pale, but now he saw the rosy cheeks shimmer through the face powder.</p><p>He grabbed his glass and took a long sip, whipping the excess wine away with the back of his hand.</p><p>\u201cMy old hag and I aren\u2019t\u2014\u201d he couldn\u2019t finish his sentence, as the giant clock on the wall struck 12, the first bell ringing through the hall. Rolling his eyes, Bakugou waited for the next beat to continue but he noticed Kirishima freezing up beside him, his eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already midnight?\u201d he barely breathed.</p><p>\u201cHuh? Yeah. We started dinner rather late because of those stupid late runners.\u201d He shrugged and picked up the last piece of meat with his fork.</p><p>\u201cI have to go.\u201d Kirishima almost threw down his cutlery, standing up with a screeching chair. Bakugou almost choked on his own spit and whipped his head around.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d He snapped. But Kirishima had already pushed the chair back far enough and took a step back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I am so, so sorry. I need to go. See you later, Baku\u2014Your Highness!\u201d And with that, he jolted around and started running. Bakugou wheezed. Not again. Kirishima would not ditch him again. With a sharp push, he stood up from his chair, on foot already planted firmly on the ground to give him leverage. He thrust forward only to collide with a servant who suddenly appeared from the side.</p><p>Bakugou toppled over with the person but could retain from falling down by rolling over his shoulder. The tray flew high up, falling down with a loud clatter, and dishes shattering on the ground. The servant held his side but was already kneeling down on both knees, head almost touching the ground.</p><p>\u201cI am incredibly sorry. Please, forgive me, Your Highness.\u201d Their voice quivered slightly and Bakugou clicked his tongue, growling under his breath. He punched the ground with his fist, flinching just barely at the pain.</p><p>Kirishima was gone. Fucking again.</p>",

Ha.<br /></p><p>You can read chapter 2 on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/18557164/chapters/44032582\" target=\"_blank\">AO3</a> if you want to! :)</p><p>In record time, Eijirou thought he never ran this fast, he sprinted down the small space between the barracks and the castle walls, shot through the next door inside the east wing and ran towards the servants&rsquo; sleeping chambers. Fortunately for him, most servants were either occupied by the still ongoing banquet or were already in their rooms.</p><p>When he arrived at his door, he jerked it open and closed it immediately after he entered, leaning against the cold wood and catching his breath. His heart was still pounding against his rib cage, he thought it would crack through the bones.</p><p>&ldquo;Eijirou!&rdquo; Mina jumped to her feet followed by Hanta, Denki nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Eijirou slowly slid down the door, huffing out a small whimper and buried his face in his knees. His friends were by his side right then, grabbing his shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;W-what happen? You were gone for so long!&rdquo; Mina cried out, voice cracking with emotion.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re covered in dirt, what the hell?&rdquo; Hanta examined his attire, dusting off the slowly drying mud from his arms and shins.</p><p>&ldquo;So many people&hellip; questions&hellip; prince&hellip; swords&hellip;&rdquo; Eijirou pressed between tight lips. He grasped at his hair, groaning.</p><p>&ldquo;What?! Slow down, what happened?!&rdquo; Mina, slowly losing her patience, shook a little more insistent at his shoulder. Eijirou groaned again, trying to order his thoughts himself. Hanta, an angel in disguise, held Mina&rsquo;s arm and shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Let the man breathe, he just needs a minute.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe we don&rsquo;t have a minute!&rdquo; Mina countered. &ldquo;Eijirou, are you being followed? Did the prince send someone after you?&rdquo; Eijirou shook his head against his knees and only then Mina allowed herself to calm down. She let go of his shoulder and sat down next to him, Hanta following her example, all three with their backs against the door.</p><p>Eijirou drew his breaths in and out, slowly regaining control of his emotions. He let go of his hair and leaned his head against the door, blinking at the ceiling as if he just realized where he was.</p><p>&ldquo;There were-&ldquo;, his voice broke and he had to clear his throat, &ldquo;there were so many people, asking me all this stuff we thought up in advance and at first everything was fine. I just wanted to eat something and then leave, that would be enough. I was so afraid some of the servants would recognize me.&rdquo; He groaned again just imagining that.</p><p>&ldquo;And then&rdquo;, he blinked, swallowing, &ldquo;the prince was there. I was introduced. To the prince. As a noble. To the prince. Guys, I talked to the prince! The prince of this very kingdom. Me!&rdquo; His eyes sprung back and forth between Mina and Hanta, growing more and more erratic as he spoke.</p><p>Hanta put a hand on his shoulder to calm him down. &ldquo;Did he notice something?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo; Eijirou inhaled. &ldquo;We talked just a little bit, I think I offended him.&rdquo; He laughed dryly. &ldquo;I thought I was going to die right that moment, oh my god. And then, and then, the queen walked over. Guys, the queen!&rdquo; He buried his face again in his hands, shaking his head in disbelief that had really happened.</p><p>&ldquo;I panicked and ran. Just straight into the crowd. I wanted to leave but then those nobles came and, hell, I talked my mouth off, guys, I don&rsquo;t even remember anymore what I was rambling about. But they were laughing, that&rsquo;s good I guess.&rdquo;</p><p>Mina chuckled slightly. &ldquo;Leave it to Eijirou, the humble servant boy making the nobles laugh in the face of his own death.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not funny!&rdquo; Eijirou wailed. &ldquo;But then, the prince was there. Just, appeared out of nowhere, grabbed my arm and took me outside. I almost hugged him. I mean, I was so fucking terrified but I was finally outside. And then.&rdquo; Eijirou stared at the ground, tilting his head in thoughts.</p><p>&ldquo;We&hellip; sparred?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You what?&rdquo; Hanta and Mina said in unison.</p><p>&ldquo;We&hellip; He took some wooden swords, gave me one and then we fought? I don&rsquo;t know guys, that was so surreal I don&rsquo;t even know.&rdquo; He shrugged helplessly. &ldquo;For like half an hour? Then he beat me, obviously, and said something about taking a bath and how filthy we are and that my hair looked almost black.&rdquo; He gestured vaguely at his hair that was, in fact, back to his original black color.</p><p>&ldquo;And then I bolted. Just straight away. And here I am.&rdquo;</p><p>Mina huffed out a breath, opening and closing her mouth, changing whatever she wanted to say every second.</p><p>&ldquo;At least he doesn&rsquo;t know who you really are.&rdquo; Hanta said with a shrug. &ldquo;Could be worse.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Worse? I insulted the prince and fought with him on equal terms! As if impersonating a noble wasn&rsquo;t bad enough, but behaving like that in front of the crown prince? I am a dead man walking.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Geez, drama queen, relax.&rdquo; Mina patted his shoulder with a little too much force, making him wince. &ldquo;I think, that was a successful evening.&rdquo; She grinned at him.</p><p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; He raised his eyebrows.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you talked to nobles, ate their food, talked to the prince, who spent time with you alone&rdquo;, she wiggled her eyebrows at that, &ldquo;and nobody found out.&rdquo; She clapped her hands in conclusion.</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo;, Eijirou sighed. &ldquo;I mean, you&rsquo;re not wrong. But I won&rsquo;t do that again. Ever.&rdquo; He huffed, crossing his arms.</p><p>Denki entered the chambers shortly after that conversation, or at least, tried to since they were all still sitting in front of the door, holding it close. He got a short recap of what transpired, made an equal conclusion as Mina and Eijirou just sighed in defeat. He let them believe, that this was a success but insisted that he won&rsquo;t do it again. He shoved the strange pot under his bed, hopefully forgetting about it soon enough.</p><p>The first two days were hell. Eijirou was so paranoid, he couldn&rsquo;t sleep, made simple mistakes at work and was just a total wreck. The third day was a lot better. He finally could sleep a few hours at a time and didn&rsquo;t jump at anyone who called him. On the fourth day, he accepted that nothing would happen. He was fine.</p><p>He sat in the kitchen on a low wooden stool, helping to peel the potatoes. A tedious, ungrateful work nobody liked doing, but Eijirou liked to rise to the occasion and took on the task. Half of the basket was peeled, half of them not. He craned his neck, rolling his shoulder with a loud crack and started on the next potato when he overheard the two cooks at the oven next to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Another banquet next week? What are they thinking?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, man. They decided yesterday and now we have to get all the ingredients in time. I think they don&rsquo;t understand this fucking job. We can&rsquo;t just make a list with everything we need.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But why another one so soon? Aren&rsquo;t they, like, just for show? Showing off their money and stuff like that?&rdquo;</p><p>As they spoke, Eijirou listened with half an ear, he didn&rsquo;t care about another banquet since it didn&rsquo;t concern him, a servant walked up and filled his tray with snacks. He chimed in without hesitation.</p><p>&ldquo;I heard it was a request by the prince himself.&rdquo; The cooks&rsquo; head whipped around. &ldquo;No kidding. Something about internal affairs or something like that. Strengthening the bond between their juris&hellip; jurisdi&hellip; the different regions within the kingdom.&rdquo; He shrugged. &ldquo;I think they said something about inviting every noble family from the Chiba region.&rdquo;</p><p>Eijirou let his knife fall down, clattering loudly on the ground. He blinked and grabbed at it, apologizing under his breath. A cold sweat broke out on his back, his heartbeat increasing.</p><p>&ldquo;Rumors have it he is looking for&hellip;&rdquo; Eijirou slowly looked up to the servant, trying to hear better what he was saying and their eyes met.</p><p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; The servant inhaled sharply. Eijirou sprung to his feet, grabbed the servant by the collar and yanked him outside. The tray fell to the ground with a loud clatter, probably everyone looked up at the commotion but Eijirou was already out the door, pushing the servant inside a small broom closet. It was big enough for two people, but they still had to stay so close to each other their knees brushed.</p><p>&ldquo;What the-&ldquo; &ndash; &ldquo;Shhh!&rdquo; Eijirou covered the servant&rsquo;s mouth with his hands, frantically shaking his head. The servant gave a slow nod and Eijirou lowered his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Holy shit, dude! You&rsquo;re the one&hellip; the one with the prince! You said thanks! I knew it, no noble could be that nice.&rdquo; He chuckled in disbelief while Eijirou was regretting every life choice he ever made, ticking off every option he had to survive this.</p><p>&ldquo;Dude, chill! I won&rsquo;t tell on you!&rdquo;</p><p>Eijirou&rsquo;s eyes focused back on the other servant. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t?&rdquo; He croaked.</p><p>&ldquo;No, man. That is just&hellip; wait, what exactly were you doing there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know, something like a bet and it went out of hand and ugh.&rdquo; Eijirou slapped a hand on his forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;I think the prince is looking for you.&rdquo; He bit his lip. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how much you hear down here, but the prince and the mysterious red-haired noble are the talks of the castle! Like, everybody saw how you and the prince left together and he came back alone, raging. Geez, I mean, I knew how much a storm he could curse but that was from a higher level.&rdquo; He crossed his arm, shaking his head.</p><p>&ldquo;And now he demanded another banquet, asking specifically for the nobles of the Chiba region, dude, he has it bad for you.&rdquo; A grin spread on his face and in every other situation he would be overjoyed at the sight of the same row of pointy teeth but right now, his ears were ringing.</p><p>&ldquo;Wh&mdash;No! We&hellip; we just&mdash;&rdquo; He shook his head. &ldquo;We were just talking and fighting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fighting, huh?&rdquo; The servant wiggled his eyebrows at him. Before Eijirou could interject, the servant held up a hand. &ldquo;Relax, man. Don&rsquo;t worry, I won&rsquo;t tell a single soul, promise. I&rsquo;m rooting for you, for whatever thing is happening between you and him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The is nothing happe&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you want to, I can be your ears and eyes inside the castle.&rdquo; He nodded at himself. &ldquo;I let you know if I overhear more about this occasion.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But&hellip; No, man, I mean, thanks. Thanks for not telling anybody and all that. But I don&rsquo;t&hellip; I&rsquo;m not doing that again.&rdquo; Eijirou shook his head. &ldquo;If anybody else will find out, I&rsquo;m dead. Like, literally dead.&rdquo;</p><p>The servant rolled his head from one shoulder to the other and hummed. &ldquo;I get it.&rdquo; He nodded. &ldquo;Okay, I tell you what. Just listen, for now, okay?&rdquo; Eijirou nodded reluctantly.</p><p>&ldquo;Like I said, everybody is talking about it. Like, all the servants that were present and even the personal maids from the prince. Something like he is nicer to them or something. I think, he really likes you. And like every servant has an easier time with him being not his usual grumpy self. So, I&rsquo;m totally rooting for you.&rdquo; He shrugged. &ldquo;My suggestion is the following: I tell the other servants about you, just the ones who saw you at the banquet. You will attend the next banquet and we&rsquo;ll help you out. And then you two can live happily ever after. Or just have a nice evening, don&rsquo;t care. Just think of something that you can&rsquo;t see him again after that.&rdquo;</p><p>Eijirou was baffled. That was the most ridiculous, preposterous, ingenious idea if he ever heard one.</p><p>&ldquo;Everyone would be on board?&rdquo; His thoughts were running a mile a second. If he could attend one more banquet and somehow make a possible excuse that he won&rsquo;t come back ever again the prince would have to let this go and he would never live in fear again.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course! Like I said, we&rsquo;re rooting for you!&rdquo; He snapped his fingers right in front of their faces, remembering something. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Tetsutetsu, by the way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Eijirou&rdquo;, Eijirou mumbled perplexed.</p><p>&ldquo;You gave him your real name?&rdquo; Tetsutetsu raised an eyebrow at him but chuckled slightly at first, then louder. Eijirou had to cover his mouth again, shushing him.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry&rdquo;, Tetsutetsu whipped a happy tear away. &ldquo;This is the best. I like you, man. You have balls.&rdquo; He nodded again, gripping at Eijirou&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;You in?&rdquo;</p><p>Eijirou&rsquo;s eyes darted around from Tetsutetsu&rsquo;s face to his hand to his grin. He inhaled deeply, grabbed his hand as tight as possible and nodded. &ldquo;Alright.&rdquo;</p><p>As soon as they left the broom closet and Tetsutetsu sprinted back to the kitchen, remembering that he was just in the middle of serving food, Eijirou took to his heels and ran the whole length of the east wing down the same corridor a few days ago and just kicked in the door to Denki&rsquo;s workplace.</p><p>&ldquo;WHA&ndash;!&rdquo; Denki threw the small flask he had in his hand in the air startled and just barely caught it. &ldquo;What in the?!&rdquo;</p><p>His head whipped around and narrowed his eyes at Eijirou. &ldquo;Dude, don&rsquo;t make me lose my job by destroying my ingredients.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;S-sorry.&rdquo; Eijirou stammered, honestly embarrassed.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Denki chirped, already forgiving Eijirou. The latter sat down on the other wooden stool, sighing.</p><p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t believe this.&rdquo; He shook his head. &ldquo;There will be another banquet next week and I&rsquo;ll be attending.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You what?!&rdquo; Denki sprung to his feet, hands on Eijirou&rsquo;s shoulders. A wide grin spreading over his face, he nodded enthusiastically. &ldquo;Knew you&rsquo;d come around. How come?&rdquo;</p><p>Eijirou briefly summarized his conversation with Tetsutetsu and their plan before he took a deep breath and stared at Denki, chewing on his lips. &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is probably the worst and best plan I have ever heard!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought!&rdquo;</p><p>They burst into a small laughing fit, wheezing. Denki held his side, rubbing over his eyes. &ldquo;Okay, dude, we need to make a plan. We need&rdquo;, he fumbled over his desk, grabbing for some ink and paper and started scribbling as he spoke, &ldquo;Mina needs to give you some more clothes, you can&rsquo;t wear the same from last time. We need to gather enough information about other families in Chiba, so you actually play a believing part to be from that jurisdiction. We need to maybe polish your overall appearance a little, like&rdquo;, he gestured a circle around Eijirou&rsquo;s face with his quill, &ldquo;maybe some powder, new hairstyle.&rdquo;</p><p>Eijirou couldn&rsquo;t even close his mouth as Denki spoke. When did his friend became so proactive and even had some really good advice? He shook his head to bring himself back to the moment and then nodded. &ldquo;Y-yeah, sounds good!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you have to learn to speak a little more proper!&rdquo; Denki actually chided but still grinning. &ldquo;Though, the prince seemed to like you nonetheless, so&hellip;&rdquo; He trailed off, shrugging. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know. Being yourself seemed to be the best course, I guess.&rdquo;</p><p>The next days were pure stress. Not only because every servant was involved in the preparations for the banquet since it was on such short notice. The chambers had to be prepared for the guests, clothes, tablecloths and draperies had to be washed, food had to be harvested and bought and hunted, dished had to be polished, the floors had to be mopped and so on. It was a little miracle, no one has dropped dead yet.</p><p>When it was only two days until the banquet, they had a little bit f time to breathe. Most of the tasks were fulfilled, there will be another rush the next day but for now, Eijirou could actually work on their other plan.</p><p>Mina had gathered some different garments while washing clothes, slowly piling it up. Eijirou didn&rsquo;t know how she could get away with it, but he suspected the other wash maiden had heard about his ordeal as well and helped out. In fact, probably everybody had heard about it by now, judging by all the knowing looks he got.</p><p>Tetsutetsu pulled him aside a few times to give an update, but nothing noteworthy has changed. Nobody has heard any other reason for the banquet to be held but the personal maids are still recounting pleasant encounters with the prince.</p><p>So, when Eijirou had the opportunity, he grabbed all the clothes Mina had gathered, shoved the mystical jug into his pocket and sneaked outside, up to the river stream. He knew Mina could help him a lot more but Eijirou wanted to try out some stuff himself. He had relied on his friends so much the last week, he wanted to lift some of their burdens.</p><p>He hid behind the trees next to the river, folded out his clothes and smeared some of the substance into his hair. It was strange how the pot never seemed to become emptier. But who was he to question some magical pot of hair dying substance?</p><p>The next step was to come up with an acceptable outfit with his limited choices and a new hairstyle.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>The two days after the banquet, Bakugou was just furious. Outstandingly furious. He snapped at everything and everyone, making them stay out of his way altogether. It was better for everyone involved. He was outraged, to be just ditched like that. What was Kirishima thinking who he was? He was just a lowly noble, just recently established and then he ditched him, the prince?</p><p>It was both infuriating and humiliating. He knew he wasn&rsquo;t the most amiable person to ever exist, but he thought that Kirishima didn&rsquo;t mind because, well, he didn&rsquo;t evade him because of it and could actually hold a conversation without licking the ground he was walking on. It was&hellip; nice. To talk to someone without being held to the standards of a prince, to just be a man.</p><p>Nevertheless, he ditched him. Just after they had the most exciting sparring fight he had in a long time. Did he do something wrong? Did he say something? Did he insult him by kicking him in the mud? It could be all three possibilities.</p><p>After he finally got himself out of his self-pity, Bakugou at first thought about just forgetting about Kirishima. They would probably never meet again. That was okay. He didn&rsquo;t need him. Then, when he was being dressed by his maids, Bakugou wasn&rsquo;t sure why but something Kirishima had said popped up in his head, he looked down at the maids, observing their movements, and asked:</p><p>&ldquo;Should I&rdquo;, the maids&rsquo; heads jerked up in alarm as they heard him growling, &ldquo;stay differently, so you can reach better?&rdquo; He was one head and a half taller than them and they often had to stretch to their toes to reach his shoulder or even get a stool to stand on. The next few seconds were filled with silence, nobody moving, until Bakugou&rsquo;s face moved back into his usual scowl.</p><p>&ldquo;Could you&rdquo;, the maid behind his back quietly piped up, &ldquo;hold up your arms, your Highness?&rdquo;</p><p>The other maids held their breaths, staring at Bakugou to see his reaction. He nodded sharply and held up his arms as he was asked. The maids exchanged some confused looks but didn&rsquo;t question his behavior. As they dressed him, the other maids started to request some simple posture changings which he did without complaining. Dressing took less time than usual.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; He mumbled when they hurried out the room and they made their curtsies with small smiles to their faces. Huh.</p><p>The next day, he paid attention. To the waiting staff, the errand boys, the servants, the gardeners. And, as Kirishima said, no one paid them any mind, not even half a glance. They just did all the work without complaining, not one hurtful glare against someone who bumped into them or dirtied the hallway just a second after it was cleaned. Maybe, just maybe, there was some truth in what Kirishima had said.</p><p>The day after that, he walked inside the chambers of his mother first thing in the morning. He didn&rsquo;t care that the guards advised against just walking in without announcing himself but he ignored them in Bakugou-fashion. He kicked the door in without knocking, his mother jerking from her bed. His father kept on snoring next to her.</p><p>&ldquo;Mother.&rdquo; He growled.</p><p>&ldquo;Son.&rdquo; His mother slowly rose, glaring at him. &ldquo;What could be so important for my precious son to wake his mother from her well-earned sleep in this manner?&rdquo;</p><p>Bakugou had to bite back some inappropriate remark, biting his lower lip. &ldquo;I want you to hold a banquet. For me.&rdquo;</p><p>Well, that stunned his mother to silence. &ldquo;You what?&rdquo;</p><p>He rolled his eyes, hard. She didn&rsquo;t have to make such deal out of it. Sure, he never ever asked for a social event he had to attend, especially not in his name.</p><p>&ldquo;You heard me. A banquet. Like the monthly thing. Just, make it for internal affairs. Reinforcing the friendship between the castle and the jurisdiction of the Chiba prefecture.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Internal&mdash;Katsuki, who are you?&rdquo; His mother grinned at him. &ldquo;Or is this about a certain red-haired man?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&mdash;No!&rdquo; Bakugou spat. &ldquo;What the fuck, mom?&rdquo; He groaned. &ldquo;I actually act like the prince you always wanted and then you make it about something stupid like that? Just. Do it.&rdquo; His lips tightened in a straight line. &ldquo;Please.&rdquo;</p><p>Mitsuki had to blink a few times to register what her son had just said. She knew when to push and when to just shut up, she was the one who raised him, after all.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure thing, Katsuki.&rdquo;</p><p>Bakugou nodded and stormed out her sleeping chambers without saying anything else, seething. That took a lot of his energy. The next days were pretty similar to his usual routine. Classes, sparring, dinner, and lunch. However, since he actually paid attention to their personal, he saw the strained faces, the hectic in their movements and the hurried gestures. It probably wasn&rsquo;t easy to prepare such a huge banquet on such short notice.</p><p>Bakugou actually felt, what audacity his feelings had these days, guilty. Guilty for putting so much pressure on them on top of their usual workload. So, when he happened to overhear some of the servants talking about the menu, what kind of proteins they still needed, he asked them, if it would help if he hunted down a deer.</p><p>The looks he got were always like a punch to his gut. Was it really so strange to ask if they needed help? Well, yeah, he answered himself, he never did in the past 19 years he had lived here. Nor knew he about anybody else who did.</p><p>That was why he now was riding down the cobblestone path behind the castle walls towards the forest, the royal hunting grounds. The bow was fastened at his saddle for now until he arrived at the forest, a quiver on his belt. Even though there was some pressure of time, Bakugou was relieved to get out of the castle again. He steered his horse down from the paved way and rode towards the small river that streamed parallel to the path towards the forest.</p><p>His horse strode leisurely, not stopping but taking its time to walk through the high grass of the riverbed. Bakugou led his view drift into the distance, relaxing for the first time since a few days. A red do next to a cluster of trees drew its attention to him. He squinted and stopped his horse, one hand on the handle of his hunting knife. He silently cursed himself that he didn&rsquo;t bring his sword, but what good would a sword do at a hunt anyway?</p><p>After observing the red dot for a few seconds, Bakugou noticed it was moving just slightly back and forth to the river and back to the trees. It seemed human alright. With a swift motion, he got off his horse and gestured the horse to stay put. They knew each other for long enough so it understood. Bakugou drew his knife and silently sneaked up to the patch of trees, squatting down to get a better view through the branches. And what a view he got.</p><p>Kirishima only wore his pants, open at the front. His chest was bare, seeing the dark happy trail from the navel down and Bakugou could finally confirm that he was built. Like a wall. His hair was pulled back into a sloppy ponytail, a few strands framing his face. His mouth was pulled in a frown as he grabbed one of the shirts laying on the ground and put it on. Kirishima tucked the shirt in, tugging on it for good measure and walked towards the river to look at his reflection.</p><p>Bakugou felt his face heat up, his heart accelerating its beating. He wasn&rsquo;t a peeping tom so he put his knife away, stood up straight and cleared his throat.</p><p>Kirishima spun around so fast, he almost lost his footing, stumbling violently before catching himself and leveling his eyes on Bakugou. His cheeks rose in color ever so lightly, but Bakugou decided to ignore it for now.</p><p>&ldquo;Y-Your Highness?&rdquo; Kirishima croaked, fumbling with his clothes, tugging at his hair, a nervous wreck some would say.</p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck are you doing here?&rdquo; Bakugou crossed his arms. Even if he was in no position to judge, this was still inside the castle walls, somewhere far away for people to see, so why would Kirishima sneak around to try on his clothes?</p><p>&ldquo;I- uhm&rdquo;, Kirishima stammered, slowly walking towards the shirts that were laying on the ground to obscure Bakugou&rsquo;s view on them, kicking at them with his heel to gather them up. Bakugou raised his eyebrow at that.</p><p>&ldquo;I was&hellip;&rdquo;, Kirishima looked over his shoulder, biting so hard on his lip Bakugou thought it would draw blood and sighed in defeat. &ldquo;I was looking for something to wear for the banquet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re coming?&rdquo; Bakugou could just hope he didn&rsquo;t sound as eager as he felt.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, yeah&rdquo;, Kirishima shrugged. &ldquo;Your Highness invited all noble families of the Chiba jurisdiction, would be kinda impolite to not attend, I guess?&rdquo; The first smile from him finally stretched over his face.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re damn right.&rdquo; Bakugou scoffed. Then his eyes drove over Kirishima, finally looking at the outfit Kirishima wore. &ldquo;That looks fucking hideous.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What, really?&rdquo; Kirishima frowned, looking down at himself. &ldquo;I was pretty confident in this.&rdquo; Bakugou huffed a small laughter, covering it with a cough. With two big steps, he was right beside Kirishima who looked at him with big eyes. Trying to ignore his gaze on him, Bakugou eyed the different shirts, pants and the two vests. Not exactly the wardrobe of a noble.</p><p>&ldquo;Why for fuck&rsquo;s sake are you dressing up in the middle of the royal castle walls?&rdquo; He grumbled. There was no heat in his words, he realized that himself already, just curiosity. Kirishima coughed, scratching his neck. He kneeled down to his shirts, pulling at their hems.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rdquo;, Kirishima bit his lips. Bakugou subconsciously filed it under a nervous tick. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have that much to choose from.&rdquo; He silently said, chuckling dryly. It didn&rsquo;t fit him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not much and I have to dress myself. Something Your Highness probably isn&rsquo;t used to.&rdquo; A wink at him and Bakugou didn&rsquo;t know if his cheeks heated up in humiliation or embarrassment.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck off.&rdquo; He huffed as he squatted down as well and earned a more earnest chuckle. &ldquo;At least I know that this shirt&rdquo;, he jabbed a finger against Kirishima&rsquo;s firm chest, &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t fit your pants.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But the pants are nice, aren&rsquo;t they?!&rdquo; Kirishima cried out in mocking despair.</p><p>&ldquo;They are.&rdquo; Bakugou grunted. He pulled at some of the shirts, eyes going back and forth between the shirts and Kirishima&rsquo;s black pants until they settled on a white shirt with a puffy collar and sleeves. He grabbed it and hold it in front of Kirishima who eyed him curiously.</p><p>&ldquo;Put this on.&rdquo; He ordered, grabbing for one of the small vests. In the corner of his eye, he could see Kirishima undress before pulling the other shirt over his head. His eyes darted down at his chest for just a second before staring back at the vest in his hands.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; Kirishima tugged the hem into his pants, fastening the cords at the frills of his sleeves. Bakugou helped him with his left sleeve and threw the vest in his face. Kirishima chuckled and tucked his arms through the open sleeve holes, butting it up. There were just three buttons, ending just shy under the poof of his collar, accentuating his broad chest just a little more.</p><p>&ldquo;Do I&hellip; Does it look good?&rdquo; Kirishima smiled shyly at him, doing things to his gut. Bakugou nodded once before Kirishima trotted over to the water, examining his reflection. Seemingly pleased, he offered Bakugou a wide grin.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; He beamed at him. Huh, it actually feels nice to hear a thank you for something he did.</p><p>&ldquo;You still didn&rsquo;t answer why the fuck you&rsquo;re inside the walls.&rdquo; Bakugou growled. &ldquo;Nobody in his right mind would sneak up inside just to play dress up.&rdquo;</p><p>Kirishima looked caught, fumbling with his sleeves. His eyes darted around, looking everywhere but at Bakugou.</p><p>&ldquo;Stop stalling. Just fucking tell me.&rdquo; He snapped.</p><p>&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo;, Kirishima sighed, &ldquo;I mean no harm, I promise. I can&rsquo;t&hellip; I can&rsquo;t tell you, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; Bakugou&rsquo;s eyes narrowed down at him but couldn&rsquo;t find any sign that indicated he was lying or wanted to deceive him in any way. He scoffed.</p><p>&ldquo;Suit your-fucking-self.&rdquo;</p><p>Kirishima threw him another apologetic smile. &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>An awkward silence stretched between them, making both of them uncomfortable. Bakugou glared at the ground, stuffing down the slight pricking feeling in his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;So&rdquo;, Kirishima walked up to him, &ldquo;what are you doing here?&rdquo; Bakugou threw a glance over his shoulder to see his horse grassing right where he left him.</p><p>&ldquo;On my way to hunt.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Kirishima exclaimed, clapping his hands. &ldquo;For the banquet?&rdquo; He nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Anything in particular? Deer? Boar?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Deer. Probably.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mhm&rdquo;, Kirishima hummed. &ldquo;I wonder how it&rsquo;ll taste?&rdquo; he mumbled. Bakugou wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was meant for him to hear but he huffed, nonetheless.</p><p>&ldquo;Like fucking deer. I don&rsquo;t think deer tastes differently in other prefectures.&rdquo; Kirishima threw him an unreadable glance.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m gonna find out anyway, huh?&rdquo; Kirishima smiled at him.</p><p>&ldquo;You want to come with me?&rdquo; They blinked at each other before Bakugou&rsquo;s brain caught up with his mouth. He coughed, taking a step back.</p><p>&ldquo;Forget tha&mdash;&ldquo; &ndash; &ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; They spoke at the same time. Bakugou&rsquo;s gaze shot up, meeting Kirishima&rsquo;s, cheeks slightly reddened.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, but I don&rsquo;t really know how to hunt, so I won&rsquo;t be of any help.&rdquo; Kirishima scratched his cheek. &ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>Bakugou huffed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m more than capable enough. Just don&rsquo;t scare it away.&rdquo; He turned around on his heels, not looking if Kirishima followed him, only hearing his footsteps falling in line behind him. He took the reins of his horse again when they reached it and climbed into his saddle again. He stepped out of the stirrup iron on Kirishima&rsquo;s side and threw him an awaiting glance.</p><p>Kirishima hesitated only for a second, taking a step forward and grabbing the hand Bakugou offered. It was warm. Kirishima put one foot in the stirrup and with a little effort, Bakugou pulled him up. Kirishima slid behind him in his saddle, his back flushed against Kirishima&rsquo;s chest. He hoped Kirishima wouldn&rsquo;t notice how hard his heart was hammering in his chest.</p><p>Bakugou steered his horse back on track and silently they rode towards the forest. Kirishima&rsquo;s breath tickled against his neck, sometimes his ear whenever he turned his head to look around, gasping voiceless at the view or an animal or whatever he deemed interesting. Bakugou tried really hard to focus on his environment, but that proved really hard with Kirishima literally all around him. His breath and voice surrounding his head, his arms pulled lightly around his waist, their torso&rsquo;s and thighs pressed against each other.</p><p>&ldquo;There.&rdquo; Kirishima mumbled softly into his ear. Bakugou could feel the tips of his ears burn, just where he felt Kirishima&rsquo;s breath. He pointed carefully between two trees and when Bakugou followed his line of sight, he saw a deer, antlers growing high above his head.</p><p>Ever so slowly, Bakugou reached for his bow, stroking over Kirishima&rsquo;s thigh with the motion, pulling out an arrow with his other hand. His motions were slow but without hesitation, assertive. He drew his arrow, aimed with one eye closed, feeling Kirishima&rsquo;s chest rising against his back. Their breathing was in synch, he felt Kirishima exhaling by his chest flattening and let go of his arrow.</p><p>The arrowhead shot through the branches right above the deer&rsquo;s front legs through his ribs, killing it instantly. Kirishima gasped again.</p><p>&ldquo;Amazing.&rdquo; His grip tightened around Bakugou&rsquo;s waist.</p><p>&ldquo;I fucking know&rdquo;, he grumbled more out of reflex. He fastened his bow back on the saddle and galloped over to their prey. He slid down from the saddle, landing on the ground with a soft thud and kneed down. Pulling out his knife, he heard Kirishima land behind him, and slit his knife through the deer&rsquo;s throat to let it bleed out.</p><p>&ldquo;We let it bleed out and then the kitchen staff will take care of the rest.&rdquo; He explained without being asked to, seeing Kirishima nod next to him.</p><p>&ldquo;You never skin and gut it yourself?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? No. It&rsquo;s all dirty and gross.&rdquo;</p><p>Kirishima laughed airily. &ldquo;Well, I think, if you want to eat something you have to go through the whole process.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you never fucking hunted yourself. So, you don&rsquo;t actually deserve to eat deer yourself.&rdquo; Bakugou shot back. Kirishima didn&rsquo;t say anything, just held his hand open for the knife. Groaning at himself, finally catching up what was going on, he handed Kirishima the knife. For someone who was praised to be a genius he sometimes was a little dense.</p><p>&ldquo;You never ate deer before.&rdquo; He answered himself quietly. Kirishima hummed and began to hold up the knife before stopping.</p><p>&ldquo;What now?&rdquo; Bakugou rolled his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;My clothes!&rdquo; Kirishima put the knife down and stripped off his vest and shirt with deft fingers. His skin was slightly flushed as he kneeled back down, grabbing for the knife again. He set the knife at the bottom of the deer&rsquo;s throat, Bakugou could see Kirishima&rsquo;s muscles tense up as he pulled the knife from left to right in one firm stroke.</p><p>Immediately, all innards fell out. Fortunately, it already bled out enough from its throat so not too much blood came out through the cut. Kirishima wiped the Knife on the grass to get the excess blood off from it and then grabbed at intestines and stomach and whatnot. He just grabbed it with his bare hands. Bakugou stared at him as if he wasn&rsquo;t human.</p><p>&ldquo;You&hellip; you just do that?&rdquo;</p><p>Kirishima blinked at him. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;&rdquo; Bakugou stopped himself. Because it&rsquo;s the servants&rsquo; job, was what he wanted to say but knowing Kirishima well enough, he would insult him with this thinking. He nodded, took a deep breath and watched Kirishima gutting the deer. After a short while, Kirishima began to explain what he was doing. He couldn&rsquo;t name much of the anatomy of the deer, Bakugou filled these blanks, but had extensive knowledge about the right procedure to prepare a deer to be cooked.</p><p>It took them about half an hour to get all its intestines properly wrapped up, another half an hour to skin it, and then strapped the deer on the back of Bakugou&rsquo;s horse. They opted to walk beside the horse, Kirishima said to have an eye on the deer so it wouldn&rsquo;t slide down but Bakugou understood that he didn&rsquo;t want to strain his horse too much with two grown men and a deer on its back. No way, he would ride then.</p><p>Bakugou had taken Kirishima&rsquo;s clothes and held onto it for now since Kirishima&rsquo;s arms were still dipped in blood right up to his elbows. After exiting the forest, Bakugou steered them back to the river and Kirishima could wash his arms. When he emerged from the water and strutted over to him, asking silently for his clothes, Bakugou had to force himself to give it back to him, he had to admit.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Ba- Your Highness.&rdquo; Kirishima snapped his eyes to the ground as he stumbled over his words, pulling the shirt over his head. Bakugou squinted his eyes at him but let it slide. He crossed his arms and waited.</p><p>&ldquo;No, really, thank you.&rdquo; Kirishima said again. &ldquo;For, you know, taking me with you and&rdquo;, he gestured at himself, &ldquo;helping me out.&rdquo;</p><p>Bakugou huffed and pulled himself back into the saddle. &ldquo;Whatever.&rdquo;</p><p>Kirishima beamed at him. &ldquo;See you at the banquet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You better will.&rdquo; He steered his horse back to the cobbled path, hitting its flanks with his heels and galloped back to the castle before he could look back.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Eijirou stood at the river as long as he could see the prince ride away. At the same time, he wished for Bakugou to turn around and to just ride away as fast as he could. Bakugou took the decision from him as he galloped away. He let out a breath he didn&rsquo;t know he held in.</p><p>He squatted down, hands to his face a made a noise between a squeal and a giggle. No, this couldn&rsquo;t be happening. No. Nope. Eijirou walked up to the patch of trees, grabbed all the clothes and, finally, ran all the way back. He already took long enough as it was. He ignored all the looks he got and was relieved he could say his red face was because of the running.</p><p>He slid into his chamber and stuffed the clothes under his bed, changing out of his current outfit. He put on his simple linen clothing, pulled his headband around his red hair and ran all the way back to the kitchen and asked for something, anything to do. He needed to be distracted.</p><p>After tackling every possible assignment, Eijirou made his way back to their chambers when it was already late. He stumbled into the room, trying to be as quiet as possible but as soon as the door swung open, his friends were on their feet, lighting a candle.</p><p>&ldquo;What happened?!&rdquo; They all whispered loudly in unison.</p><p>&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; Kirishima stuttered. His brain provided him instantly with his memories of today&rsquo;s afternoon, Bakugou&rsquo;s eyes constantly roaming over his own naked chest, his body pressed against him, brushing against each other with every step the horse had taken. His face flushed unbelievable hot.</p><p>&ldquo;You met the prince, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Mina gave him a knowing look, receiving nothing but a nod in confirmation. His friends high fived each other.</p><p>&ldquo;Guys&rdquo;, Eijirou whined, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not something to celebrate. I will only meet him once again and then never again. This just makes everything&rdquo;, he huffed in annoyance, &ldquo;more complicated.&rdquo;</p><p>His friends followed him with his eyes as he prepared for bed, exchanging glanced.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Denki asked.</p><p>Eijirou&rsquo;s shoulders tensed before falling down. &ldquo;You know what I mean.&rdquo; He shook his head. &ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s talk hypothetically.&rdquo; He sat down on his bed, his friends following suit. &ldquo;Hypothetically, I like him. And he liked me. We met at the banquet, becoming even better friends. Yeah, well, surprise I have to move to another country, so see you never again.&rdquo; He groaned. &ldquo;This will just&hellip; suck.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And if you just, I don&rsquo;t know, play along for a little longer?&rdquo; Mina asked quietly.</p><p>&ldquo;Deceiving him? Playing someone, I am not? Yeah, great. And either it will suck even more when we have to stop seeing each other or he&rsquo;ll find out eventually and take it upon himself to stab me to death. I don&rsquo;t want to&hellip;&rdquo;, he clenched his jaw, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to lie to him anymore. I mean, hypothetically, if I liked him, lying to the person you like is just not right.&rdquo; Eijirou fell backward onto his pillow, both arms spread to his sides, bumping against the wall with his knuckles.</p><p>&ldquo;Just two more days.&rdquo; He mumbled into the almost darkness. His friends stayed silent. There wasn&rsquo;t anything they could say because deep down, they knew Eijirou was right. There was no possible solution that a prince and a servant could ever be friends, let alone anything else.</p><p>Eijirou tried not to think about the upcoming banquet too hard for the next days but that was kind of impossible since every waking second he was reminded that it was happening due to all the assignments their wing was flooded with. The day before the banquet was especially brutal. Some of the guests had already arrived and demanded attention on top of preparing for the event. Eijirou still was grateful, working and running around at least occupied his brain well enough to actually think about that he would be attending as well.</p><p>Well, until it was finally was the day of the banquet. His thoughts caught up with the impending task at hand and made him jittery. His hands trembled, his mind wandered. What he couldn&rsquo;t really grasp was, was it just anticipation acting as a noble or did he, as a matter of fact, not want to part ways with the prince? He didn&rsquo;t know and, to be honest, he didn&rsquo;t want to know.</p><p>When it was finally time to get ready, all the other servants ushered him out of the kitchen, encouraging to do whatever he wanted, with a wink, that they could handle the rest. With a heavy sigh, he left for his chambers where Mina was already waiting for him.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow, you look like you&rsquo;re on the way to a funeral.&rdquo; She smacked his back. &ldquo;Cheer up, you&rsquo;re gonna see your prince tonight.&rdquo; She chuckled with a knowing look.</p><p>&ldquo;He is not my prince&rdquo;, he grumbled in response but, oh no, did he want him to be his? Shaking his head, he banished the thought as soon as it came up and pulled out the clothes he prepared for tonight. Mina helped him dress, to give a few knowing tucks so it framed his body just the right way.</p><p>Eijirou had already smeared some of the substance into his air before he went to bed last night, not entirely sure how much time he would have for getting ready. Turned out, enough time.</p><p>&ldquo;Sit&rdquo;, Mina ushered him to sit on the floor in front of the bed, sitting down behind him. She brushed his hair with a broken comb and started to part his hair. Slowly she started to braid different wisps of hair on the side until it united in the middle of the back of his head and became one thicker braided tail, which was slightly raised with a black bow. The end of the ponytail was fastened with a thin black strand.</p><p>Eijirou carefully drove his hand over his hair, feeling the tight strands and when Mina handed him her mirror, he let out a tiny gasp.</p><p>&ldquo;Mina!&rdquo; He turned his head from one side to the other, a few shorter strands on his forehead bobbing with the motion, and his smile grew. &ldquo;That looks amazing! Thank you!&rdquo; He turned around fully and pulled her in a firm embrace. Mina laughed into his shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not difficult to make a pretty person pretty.&rdquo; She tightened her hold for a second before they both let go. &ldquo;Eijirou&rdquo;, she tugged at his frilly collar, stroking over his vest.</p><p>&ldquo;I want you to know, that we will be on your side. Whatever will happen, whatever your decision will be.&rdquo;</p><p>Eijirou nodded, trying not to cry on the spot. Mina patted his cheek. &ldquo;You still have time to cry. As soon as I&rsquo;m finished with you I won&rsquo;t let you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mina!&rdquo; Eijirou wailed, again, pressing his face into her chest. She patted his hair and hushed him.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ve got you.&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded, took in a deep breath and sat up again. &ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; Mina grabbed some of the make-up utensils she could gather over the span of last week with the help of other maids and started to apply some powder on his cheeks, drew a fine line on the wing of his eyelids with charcoal and dabbed some red substance onto his lips, making them even rosier than they were anyway.</p><p>&ldquo;Perfect.&rdquo; Mina admired her own work.</p><p>Eijirou took his time to mentally prepare himself, just staring at the wall of their chamber, Mina at his side, holding his hand. They went through the plan often enough he could recite it by heart. In hindsight, he was grateful for Tetsutetsu to get all the other servants on board with this over the top stupid plan. It took some pressure off his shoulder, especially, since the servant who was announcing the guests was as excited as everybody else and could play the part, so he didn&rsquo;t have to sneak in again. Particularly, because this is an event hosted for his apparent home prefecture and it would seem pretty odd that he had to sneak in for that.</p><p>Come in, eat and drink something, tell Bakugou he needed to leave the country because he was promised some young maiden in a far away state and then leave. Easy enough.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Bakugou was in high spirit in the past few days. High spirit meant, he didn&rsquo;t snap at everything and some of his heat left his voice, but rarely someone noticed. Still, Bakugou could feel a little change in his mood. Was it because of the little trip with Kirishima? Probably. But he wouldn&rsquo;t admit to that out loud.</p><p>He noticed a difference in how he was treated by the servants as well as much as he treated them differently. Not that he thanked them for everything they did, it was still their job, but he at least acknowledged their existence, gave them a short nod when, for example, one of them brought him a snack or he saw maids dusting off the busts in the hallway. Which made them a little less&hellip; afraid of him, Bakugou dared to say. He didn&rsquo;t think it was bad to be afraid of him, it meant respect. But somehow, being asked by his staff if he liked his tea rather with one or two spoons of sugar instead of just needed to be told how he wanted it, felt something akin to trust to him.</p><p>Trust with the people he wanted to lead.</p><p>&ldquo;Did something good happen, Your Highness?&rdquo;</p><p>Aizawa pulled him out of thoughts. He didn&rsquo;t listen for the past few minutes, he assumed. Blinking the thoughts away, Bakugou wore his usual scowl etched on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;The fuck you want?&rdquo;</p><p>Unfazed, Aizawa turned back two pages and sighed. &ldquo;Just asking. I thought for a second there, you were smiling. Must be a trick of my mind.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Damn sure it was.&rdquo; Bakugou snapped but turned his face down to the desk. Just in case. There was no way, such stupid, sappy thoughts would make him smile. Fortunately for him, Aizawa didn&rsquo;t care much about his current mental state and continued or rather repeated his lecture about the Chiba prefecture. Bakugou was making sure he knew about each and everything of the regions so he could host the best banquet they had ever attended.</p><p>Time flew by, the day filled with his usual routine of lecture, lunch, greeting some of the early guests and getting ready for the banquet. He noticed as the maids dressed him that they were a little more fidgeting, suppressed smiles here and there. He didn&rsquo;t stoop so low as to ask what was that all about even if his curiosity was stretched to its limit. Instead, he looked at his reflection in the wide mirror, tucking at his collar and sleeves to make himself more comfortable, and thought about someone he might, he better be, meet this evening.</p><p>Kirishima was a mystery to him. Starting by his appearance, what noble did have red hair? And it looked natural, he couldn&rsquo;t really be at fault but he could try to get some hair masks or whatever, so it wouldn&rsquo;t be that red. But it matched his eye color which was satisfying. And of course, the main reason he was such a mystery was his demeanor toward nobility. There was leisure in his speech, his gestures, his being he wasn&rsquo;t used to in a noble. Which was refreshing. He felt like talking to a human being and not someone who recited the usual pleasantries. Especially, he felt he could talk to him freely. Because or Kirishima&rsquo;s leisure he didn&rsquo;t feel like Kirishima forced himself to speak with him or to kiss his ass, just, he was honest.</p><p>He wanted to know the secrets Kirishima harbored. There was something he didn&rsquo;t tell him, obviously, and it felt like a challenge. Was he worthy enough to encode this enigma called Kirishima Eijirou?</p><p>His feet brought him to the ballroom, he nodded toward the servants opening the door and received small bows, and entered the room which was slowly filled with attendees. Automatically, his eyes scanned the crowd for a specific redhead but didn&rsquo;t find anything. He tried to ignore the disappointment in his chest. Taking in a deep breath he made his way to the side of his mother, greeting everyone who stopped him.</p><p>Whenever the door opened, his head jerked up, squinting at the people coming in and whenever it was not a specific red-haired man, his scowl grew deeper.</p><p>&ldquo;What made you so peeved, my dear son?&rdquo; His mother nudged him with her elbow, pushing it deep between his ribs and he suppressed a wince.</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up. Nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hum.&rdquo; She hummed, grin growing a little wider, a little wickeder. &ldquo;Awaiting someone?&rdquo; Bakugou narrowed his eyes on her and clicked his tongue.</p><p>&ldquo;Why would I? Just waiting for everybody to arrive to eat, I&rsquo;m starving.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You sure, you aren&rsquo;t thirsty?&rdquo;</p><p>Bakugou chocked on his own spit and spun around. &ldquo;Mother&mdash;&rdquo; but before he could finish his sentence, the door opened again and his ears heard the quiet announcement.</p><p>&ldquo;Sir Kirishima Eijirou, first and only son of Lady Kirishima Tomoya.&rdquo;</p><p>Bakugou&rsquo;s voice died in his throat as he looked up to Kirishima walking through the doors, wearing the outfit he put together for him and an elaborate hairstyle. Maybe it was the chandelier or the lightning overall but to him, it looked like Kirishima was glowing.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t hear what his mother said to him, just walking right up to Kirishima who was already getting attention by other bystanders. He pushed through them until he was right in front of him.</p><p>&ldquo;Finally decided to show up, dumbwhit?&rdquo; He crossed his arms, taking a quick once over glance at Kirishima before settling on the small smile that appeared on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Aw, did Your Highness miss me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You fucking wish.&rdquo; His fist shot out against the other&rsquo;s shoulder earning a small grunt, but it turned into a chuckle. Kirishima rubbed at his shoulder and shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Need &nbsp;to work on my reflexes so I can kick you&rsquo;re a&mdash;to win fair and square.&rdquo; He coughed and scratched his cheek.</p><p>&ldquo;Why the fuck do you think I care about your wording?&rdquo; As if caught, Kirishima&rsquo;s eyes shot open, blinking.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, I&hellip;&rdquo;, his hand traveled to his neck, rubbing at it, &ldquo;I mean, you&rsquo;re still the prince and I&rsquo;m far beneath you, so&rdquo;, he shrugged as he trailed off, eyes looking up at him sheepishly. &ldquo;Do you&hellip; don&rsquo;t want me to?&rdquo;</p><p>Bakugou glared at him with a small grunt and shrugged. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s whatever. I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo; Kirishima hummed, leaning over a little.</p><p>&ldquo;Then, Your Highness, please let me kick your ass next time we spar.&rdquo; Bakugou&rsquo;s eyes narrowed down on Kirishima&rsquo;s beaming smile and shoved his shoulder at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Big words for someone who couldn&rsquo;t even get one hit in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I almost had you&hellip; that one time, I think.&rdquo;</p><p>Bakugou chuckled ever so lightly at the contemplating look on Kirishima&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;You and thinking? I highly doubt that.&rdquo; When their eyes locked, his heart stuttered for just a second when he saw the tiny, yet warm smile meant for him.</p><p>&ldquo;So, you do can laugh.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck off!&rdquo; Bakugou shoved at him again but Kirishima was laughing wholeheartedly already.</p><p>For the next hour, they kept on bantering, trying to one-up each other for their next sparring session and walked around the room. Bakugou had to stop every now and then to hold an obliging conversation with which he really could live without. His eyes always trailed off to his side, where Kirishima was apparently glued to him, never really leaving him but not chiming in in the conversation. Afterward, when they were alone again, Bakugou listed off some trivial information of the noble they were talking to. Not to impress Kirishima or anything.</p><p>Then, a small bell was rung, and his mother invited their guests to join her at the dinner table. Bakugou made a face and lead Kirishima to the table, scanning it for Kirishima&rsquo;s name badge and was pleasantly surprised to find him seated directly at his side. Whoever decided their seating order needed to be thanked. He almost pulled out the chair to offer it to Kirishima but could stop himself in time. Instead, he sat down on his own chair, registering by the movement next to him that Kirishima sat down as well.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know what will be served?&rdquo; Kirishima leaned in and whispered to Bakugou. He just shrugged.</p><p>&ldquo;Probably the same as always. Soup, fish, meat, dessert.&rdquo; Pushing his lips up a little higher in a scowl. &ldquo;Always the same.&rdquo;</p><p>Kirishima tilted his head at that. &ldquo;You&hellip; don&rsquo;t like having four different courses?&rdquo; Bakugou rolled his eyes and groaned.</p><p>&ldquo;No, Shitty-shima, I don&rsquo;t like having the same four courses every damn day. I thought we have top chefs who like to experiment and give us something to look forward to and not this bland shit, every day.&rdquo;</p><p>His mother cleared her throat and shot him a meaningful glare which he answered in the same manner. She rolled her eyes and stood up, all conversations died down.</p><p>&ldquo;My honored guests, it is my pleasure to welcome you at our home.&rdquo; She raised her glass. &ldquo;It is not only a joy for me to see you come from a faraway place to strengthen our bonds but, as well, that my son takes it upon himself to fight for these bonds.&rdquo;</p><p>He scuffed under his breath but Kirishima nudged his knee under the table, nodding at him with a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;So, thank you, my dear son, Katsuki, to present us this opportunity. Would you like to say something yourself to our guests?&rdquo;</p><p>&lsquo;No&rsquo; was the first thing he wanted to say but clenched his jaw to not blurt it out. His eyes found Kirishima&rsquo;s and he sighed. He stood up with a glass in his hand, looking them all over once.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for following my invitation when I reached out for you. It is a great honor to have you all assembled in these halls and I hope to nourish our relationship with newly found friends and allies.&rdquo; His expression turned a little sour. He hated speaking as if he had a stick up his ass. &ldquo;Then, let&rsquo;s toast to our friends and eat to our heart&rsquo;s desire, I&rsquo;m fucking starving.&rdquo; He down his glass and sat down.</p><p>Kirishima was the first to break the stunned silence with a laugh and the others followed suit. Pleased by himself, Bakugou gave his mother a courteous nod who in turn fixed him with a knowing look in her eyes, dancing between him and Kirishima. He chose to ignore that and turned his attention back to Kirishima who was beaming at the soup that was brought in.</p><p>&ldquo;That looks delicious!&rdquo; He gasped as a bowl was put in front of him.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fucking soup.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, well, Your Highness, even &lsquo;fucking soup&rsquo; can taste pretty good!&rdquo; Kirishima mimicked his words with the same grumpy expression, Bakugou assumed he was wearing right now and kicked Kirishima under the table, earning a snicker.</p><p>It was fascinating to watch Kirishima eat a simple potato soup as if it was some blessed meal. His face beamed with every spoonful, humming every other bite and when he wiped his bowl clean with the slice of bread, it was pure bliss on his face. It was fucking soup. And yet, it made Bakugou enjoy his own soup a little more, admitting that it, in fact, did taste pretty good.</p><p>When the fish was served, Bakugou witnessed a rather peculiar situation. He was just quipping back in forth with his parents, when he out of the corner of his eye saw that Kirishima was grabbing for the wrong knife regarding eating fish. When he was about to say something, Kirishima locked eyes with the servant on the other side of the table. They shook their head so lightly, it was only visible if you look for it. Kirishima then moved his hand to the next, another shake and when he touched the right knife, he got a nod. They exchanged a subtle smile and the servant was gone.</p><p>As if nothing had happened, Kirishima turned back to Bakugou, grinning at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know which fish will be served?&rdquo;</p><p>Still a little dumbfounded what he just witnessed, Bakugou shook his head. &ldquo;Fish.&rdquo; He deadpanned. Kirishima chuckled at him.</p><p>&ldquo;I sure hope it is fish since it is the fish course. Man&rdquo;, his eyes grew distant, &ldquo;if that&rsquo;s all it takes to be a prince, I have a pretty good chance to become one myself.&rdquo;</p><p>That earned him, at the same time, a hard kick under the table and a chuckle from the queen. Kirishima&rsquo;s quiet yelp was accompanied by his flashing cheeks as he shot a glance towards the queen. A shy smile formed on his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;This is Sir Kirishima Eijirou from whom I&rsquo;ve heard a lot recently, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; The queen asked between bites.</p><p>&ldquo;Y-yes, Your Majesty.&rdquo; Kirishima bowed his head slightly and Bakugou could see him fumble, apparently undecided if he was allowed to continue eating or waiting for some conversation. He rolled his eyes and nudged his knee, nodding at his fish. Relief washed over Kirishima as he took the next bite.</p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen Katsuki hold such a long conversation in a long time without chasing the other party away. What&rsquo;s your secret?&rdquo;</p><p>Kirishima snorted slightly but shook his head. &ldquo;No secret, Your Majesty. Just honest&hellip; I like the way he is.&rdquo; Another smile, almost fond, formed on his lips and a bit of fish fell from Bakugou&rsquo;s fork as he stopped it right before his mouth. Ignoring the heat forming on his cheeks he bit down hard on his fork.</p><p>His mother just laughed. &ldquo;Oh, dear Sir, that is truly fascinating. Do tell, what is it you like about my son?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; Bakugou almost shouted, heads turning to see what the commotion was about. Bakugou glared at his mother, having a silent conversation with his eyes alone. Which Mitsuki choose to ignore.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it, Katsuki? I just thought it was nice to know about redeeming qualities you have I&rsquo;m not aware of.&rdquo; Her smile stretched on his face, every inch of it smug.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, is it so hard to believe someone likes the son you raised? That is really reassuring.&rdquo; Bakugou snapped with fake hurt, lashing his anger out on his fish. The queen waited for another second before bursting out in a fit of laughter, dispersing the heavy atmosphere that had formed. Bakugou grumbled.</p><p>Kirishima touched his elbow with his own, searching for his eyes. He glanced over, pursing his lips. Slightly leaning forward, Kirishima held their gaze and whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;For what it&rsquo;s worth, I like how determined you are, among other things.&rdquo; He had the audacity to wink at him. Bakugou felt another wave of heat rising up his face but also in his chest, tightening around his lungs. He grunted in response.</p><p>When they were finished with the fish, Kirishima leaned over again. His eyes were cast down, his fingers twitching at his napkin.</p><p>&ldquo;I&mdash;Can we talk after dinner? There is something I have to tell you.&rdquo;</p><p>Bakugou&rsquo;s eyes narrowed. &ldquo;Why not tell me fucking now?&rdquo;</p><p>Kirishima shook his head, a sad smile on his lips he didn&rsquo;t like one bit. &ldquo;We should talk&hellip; in private.&rdquo; Bakugou rolled his eyes but nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever.&rdquo; Whatever, indeed. It wasn&rsquo;t important that his heart clenched by the sorrowful look Kirishima wore or that he held his breath when he thought about what Kirishima had to tell him in private.</p><p>When the meat course was served, his mother raised her glass again. &ldquo;I want to thank my son since he was the one who shot the deer for us today.&rdquo;</p><p>Quiet &lsquo;oh&rsquo;s and &lsquo;ah&rsquo;s were uttered.</p><p>&ldquo;Kirishima helped.&rdquo; Bakugou grumbled. His mother raised her eyebrows, tilting her head.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh? I wasn&rsquo;t aware of that. Of course, thank you, Sir Kirishima, as well. How come?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; Kirishima&rsquo;s eyes widened and Bakugou saw him looking over to him in search for help.</p><p>&ldquo;We just kinda ran into each other. And since I was on my way I just invited him to tag along. He was the one who&mdash;&rdquo; Kirishima stepped on his foot and shook his head almost undetectable. Bakugou stumbled a little over his words and glared at him.</p><p>&ldquo;We both took it down.&rdquo; He said in the end. His mother nodded again, forming polite conversation with the person next to his father, throwing Bakugou a meaningful look. But Bakugou had already turned his head to Kirishima.</p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck was that about?&rdquo; He hissed. Kirishima shrugged at him noncommittally.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want people to know.&rdquo; It was rather formed a question as he raised his voice at the end. Bakugou pinched his nose with two fingers, taking a few deep breaths. Why in the world was he keeping up with this? There was no logical reason and he was well aware of that fact, making it even more frustrating to him. Glancing back to Kirishima and seeing him savoring the meat, however, he decided it didn&rsquo;t matter really that much that he knew why.</p><p>&ldquo;Are all banquets like that?&rdquo; Kirishima asked in between bites.</p><p>Bakugou finally started eating as well. &ldquo;Mostly. It&rsquo;s literally a banquet, dumbass.&rdquo; He scowled at Kirishima&rsquo;s chuckle. &ldquo;Sometimes there are dances, though.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dances?&rdquo; Kirishima beamed at him. &ldquo;Aw, man, that would have been great.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What, you like dances?&rdquo; Bakugou perked one eyebrow up. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look like one to dance.&rdquo;</p><p>Kirishima shrugged. &ldquo;I&hellip; don&rsquo;t actually. I mean, I don&rsquo;t know how&rdquo;, lowering his voice Kirishima poked at his meat, &ldquo;but I wanted to attend a formal dance for so long, you know. Preferable after I learned how to dance.&rdquo; Another chuckle.</p><p>Bakugou eyed him for a second, an idea forming inside his head and before he could stop himself, he said: &ldquo;I could teach you.&rdquo;</p><p>Kirishima&rsquo;s head jerked up, staring at him with glistening eyes. &ldquo;You would?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Idiot&rdquo;, Bakugou cleared his throat, chewing the rest of his meat in his mouth, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what I said, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; He fixed his eyes back on the plate since he couldn&rsquo;t bear looking further at Kirishima&rsquo;s blinding smile. A few seconds went by without Kirishima answering so he chanced another glance.</p><p>Kirishima separated the vegetables from his meat with his fork, poking at it absentmindedly. His smile was already dropped and Bakugou felt his chest tighten, again. Should he see his physician about this?</p><p>&ldquo;Got a problem with that?&rdquo; he snapped instead.</p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; Kirishima blinked up at him. &ldquo;No! No, not at all. It&rsquo;s just&hellip;&rdquo; he bit his lip, avoiding his gaze. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you later, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s with all that&mdash;&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;So, Sir Kirishima&rdquo;, his mother interrupted him mid-sentence and he had to count from 10 backward to no yell at her.</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t your mother come to join us today? I would have thought, she would be delighted as a recently declared Lady?&rdquo; She took a long sip, fixing Kirishima in his seat with her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Y-yes, Your Majesty.&rdquo; Kirishima voice sounded raspy. &ldquo;She extends her thanks for the invitation, however, she couldn&rsquo;t make it because of her health.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, dear. I hope she will get better soon.&rdquo; Bakugou&rsquo;s mother held a hand to her chest, shaking her head. &ldquo;I hope she can join us for the next banquet. I&rsquo;d like to meet the woman who raised such a good boy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To see how it&rsquo;s actually done?&rdquo; Bakugou finally quipped. He wasn&rsquo;t to let it slide that she kept interrupting him and made a fool out of him. His mother shot him a glare.</p><p>&ldquo;For you to see how to treat a mother right, my dear son.&rdquo;</p><p>He heard Kirishima stifle a laugh next to him, so he jerked his head around. &ldquo;You fucker like laughing about me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;N-no&rdquo;, he grinned, holding a hand up in front of his mouth, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just&hellip; I&rsquo;m happy to see you&rsquo;re having such a good relationship with your mother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;Where did you get that idea from?!&rdquo; Bakugou blinked at him incredulously. Kirishima leaned back against his chair, humming.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you can only really banter like this with someone you actually care about, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; A fond smile spread over his face. Did he wear make-up? Bakugou noticed the thin black line on his eyelid, giving his eyes a more edged shape. And before, he thought Kirishima looked a little pale, but now he saw the rosy cheeks shimmer through the face powder.</p><p>He grabbed his glass and took a long sip, whipping the excess wine away with the back of his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;My old hag and I aren&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo; he couldn&rsquo;t finish his sentence, as the giant clock on the wall struck 12, the first bell ringing through the hall. Rolling his eyes, Bakugou waited for the next beat to continue but he noticed Kirishima freezing up beside him, his eyes wide.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s already midnight?&rdquo; he barely breathed.</p><p>&ldquo;Huh? Yeah. We started dinner rather late because of those stupid late runners.&rdquo; He shrugged and picked up the last piece of meat with his fork.</p><p>&ldquo;I have to go.&rdquo; Kirishima almost threw down his cutlery, standing up with a screeching chair. Bakugou almost choked on his own spit and whipped his head around.</p><p>&ldquo;What? Why?&rdquo; He snapped. But Kirishima had already pushed the chair back far enough and took a step back.</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip; I am so, so sorry. I need to go. See you later, Baku&mdash;Your Highness!&rdquo; And with that, he jolted around and started running. Bakugou wheezed. Not again. Kirishima would not ditch him again. With a sharp push, he stood up from his chair, on foot already planted firmly on the ground to give him leverage. He thrust forward only to collide with a servant who suddenly appeared from the side.</p><p>Bakugou toppled over with the person but could retain from falling down by rolling over his shoulder. The tray flew high up, falling down with a loud clatter, and dishes shattering on the ground. The servant held his side but was already kneeling down on both knees, head almost touching the ground.</p><p>&ldquo;I am incredibly sorry. Please, forgive me, Your Highness.&rdquo; Their voice quivered slightly and Bakugou clicked his tongue, growling under his breath. He punched the ground with his fist, flinching just barely at the pain.</p><p>Kirishima was gone. Fucking again.</p>",
