Of course more often, when he did get stopped by an Imperial Trooper, no matter how many IDs he had, or documents, they still just had to make sure everything checked out, which meant a trip to a detention center and calls to people that just happened to not be available today and searching through very lengthy databases. Still, it was better to just have his papers ready. Worse comes to worse he could always just escape. </p><p>Everything was in order and ready. Now to make his decent through the planets atmosphere and make his landing. Shortly Glee Anselms enormous oceans came into view.
