(It is) the simple thing of the storyline requiring for that to happen,&rdquo; she said in a roundtable interview at the Corinthia Hotel in London last month.</p><p>Clarke was there to promote the eighth and final season of Game Of Thrones, which premieres on HBO (StarHub TV Ch 601/Singtel TV Ch 420) on April 15 at 9am, with a same-day encore at 10pm. It is also available on HBO Go and HBO On Demand.</p><p>She added: &ldquo;Kit&rsquo;s arse, someone else&rsquo;s arse, my arse, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. It&rsquo;s not what the show is about, it&rsquo;s not what any bit of acting is about.&rdquo;</p><p>The steamy scene saw the subtle flirting between Daenerys and Harington&rsquo;s character Jon Snow finally consummated - with an incestuous twist, as their aunt-nephew relationship was revealed simultaneously.</p><p>That Clarke and Harington are close friends made the scene equally uncomfortable in real life.</p><p>She said: &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t stop being weird. You put us in a room together and it is just non-stop giggling.&rdquo;</p><p>But going into Season 8, fans can expect the relationship between Jon and Daenerys to get more intense.</p><p>Clarke said: &ldquo;It is the most important relationship that either of them has.
