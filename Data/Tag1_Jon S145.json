The show promo gives us Cat in the crypts. The show wants us to think Jon and Dany might have a baby.</p><p><br/></p><p>But the purpose of having Sansa raise it would be to make up for Cat\u2019s mistake. And in the books that just doesn\u2019t seem likely because of Lady Stoneheart. If Cat has died and that was it, maybe.

Was \u00a0it the type of wether she had never been exposed to before? She had never really been outside much. Was that the problem? </p><p>You hadn\u2019t felt like this since the day she was born. Since she- Don\u2019t think about it. You felt like you failed her then, you felt like you were failing her now. Her fever was the highest you\u2019d ever seen. Tommen used to get some of the worst fevers whenever he was sick. She felt like the fire you had pulled her out of when she was just a baby. When the fire bit at your own skin. Thats what her fever felt like. Her hair slicked back with sweat and her small body shivering despite how hot she felt to you. You draped a blanket over her small body as the white cat curled up her face very carefully as not to wake her.</p><!-- more --><p>You spent hours here. In this one position just staring at her. Watching as she tossed and turned in her uncomfortable sleep.</p><p>You remembered hearing how such a harsh fever could- could take her life. You were scared. This was the one thing you had been living for for the past five years. You went through hell for six months with Arya in the streets. Trying to protect her. Trying to keep you both fed. Trying to make sure your baby was okay every evening. </p><p>The day she was born was the worst and best day of your life. You had done it all alone. Gone through your pregnancy alone, gave birth alone in your room. You remembered catching her small body in your two hands. Two hands that nearly covered her body completely at the time. Now, your small hands barley covered her upper back. </p><p>There were so many reasons why Lucia was as short and skinny as she was. Partly because of you, mostly because of Joffrey. </p><p>You missed them. They were all dead. People you knew were dropping like flies. All the Baratheons were gone, all thanks to the affair your mother had with your uncle. If it weren\u2019t for her, you would have all been legitimate children of Robert\u2019s. Really and Stannis wouldn\u2019t have died fighting a war about who was the rightful heir to the throne.</p><p>Then the Targaryens. Because of your family only Daenerys was left. One went mad so they all had to die. </p><p>The Reynes. The believed they could be as powerful as the Lannisters. And your grandfather put a quick stop to that. Killing them all and handing their bodies around Casterly Rock for an entire summer. Men, women and babies. Even the handmaidens were killed. Everyone who your grandfather could get.</p><p>The Tyrells. Loras had been kind to you. Claiming Lucia as his own after being forced to marry you by your mother. You wanted to kill her for burning everyone. Only Olenna was left alive. She couldn\u2019t carry on the family name. She didn\u2019t have Tyrell blood, she had married into the family.</p><p>All of these people. They were all dead because of your family. Because of Tywin, Jaime and Joffrey.</p><p>You could hear the door open behind you. Not a squeak, just the sound of the handle being pushed into your chambers. The heavy door hitting against the stone walls of the room. Awoken by the sound, Ser Robb\u2019s head popped up and looked at the intruder.</p><p>You turned your head to see Missandei and one of the dothracki women, who you always saw with children following her.</p><p>\u201cLady Y/N, I have brought one of the Dothracki mothers. She would like to take a look at your daughter.\u201d</p><p>You looked at this stranger cautiously and moved aside from Lucia so she could see what was wrong with your daughter.</p><p>She took a few steps forward and looked over her. Resting the back of her hand on her forehead and looking over her small face. All the while speaking in Dothracki. Suddenly she stood and turned to Missandei speaking in her native tongue to her before leaving. Missandei\u2019s face dropped. Her eyes going to the little girl.</p><p>\u201cMissandei? What did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said she\u2019ll be lucky to see the sun rise and set tomorrow. But if she makes it to rise she\u2019ll live.\u201d You looked down to the stone flooring as she left very quickly after the dothracki woman. </p><p>You hadn\u2019t felt this feeling since you left Winterfell. The feeling of your heart breaking as you scooped her up in your arms, holding her close.</p><p>\u201cMama?\u201d She asked weakly not even opening her tired eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, little snow.\u201d You said choking back tears as you held her close to you.</p><p>\u201cCan you sing mama?\u201d</p><p>You nodded and was barley able to get out \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA raven flies from the north to the sea. A dragon whispers he name in the east. The Watcher waits on the northern wall. A daughter picks up a warrior\u2019s sword. A brother bound to a love he must hide. The younger\u2019s armor is worn in the mind, and a cold iron throne, used to hold two boys barley grown. And now it is known. A claim to the prize, a crown laced in lies. You win or you die.\u201d</p><p>You could feel her breathing even out as she fell asleep again. </p><p>You could remember everyone who made the largest impacts on your life. ANd you could clearly remember Catelyn. The thing she had made for Bran after his fall. How she had beckoned you over to help make one.</p><p>She had said only northern mothers make them for when their child is ill or is facing grave danger. And now, here you were. You remembered she called it a prayer wheel. She said that if you were to one day marry Robb, you should know how to make them for your own children if they were ever ill. And now here you were, weaving together a seven pointed star out of thread you had found in the chest in the corner Catelyn had made her\u2019s out of stick and cloth. Whatever she could find. You could only find rocks around the island. So you resorted to this. Threading it together like it was a flower crown. Something Olenna had taught you make whenever one of her handmaidens couldn\u2019t make one for Lucia. </p><p>You didn\u2019t know what the night would bring. Wether it was a dead daughter by sunrise who you\u2019d have to bury or a little girl who was ill, but would live.</p><p>The past five years, you\u2019d had nothing.Everything you ever had was stripped from you the moment you left Jon Snow. Any claim you could have made to the throne, becoming a mother to highborn children, which was never a thing you aspired to be.</p><p>The past five years all you had was a small child who held your hand everywhere you went. A small child who put back together your broken heart after Jon.</p><p>When you cried in your mother\u2019s arms it wasn\u2019t because you were scared. You couldn\u2019t ever be scared to bring a child into the world. You weren\u2019t upset you were becoming a mother. You were crying because you didn\u2019t think you could do it without Jon by your side.</p><p>You never thought that someone you had met five years ago, and someone you had only known for a fortnight would have changed your life like he did, He looked at you as if there something in you worth looking at. He showed you what it meant to be loved. And you showed him that even a bastard could be loved. And in the end, he gave you a child. Something Tyrion often jokingly said was his parting gift to you.</p><p>You didn\u2019t think you could do it. Yet here you were. A sick child in front of you. A little girl who built you back up again after Joffrey had beaten you down, after you could no longer be with Jon. You had raised her. You named her and and you protected her to no end. </p><p>Someone so small, who had relied on your body to keep her safe for nine months and relied on you for so long to feed her, so long to keep her warm in your arms wrapped in a silk blanket. Someone so small, you could loose.</p><p>You could already feel your heart breaking at the thought of it. The thought of loosing Lucia to whatever illness she had. The strong little girl who could touch fire without being burnt, the brave little girl who was practically attached to you at the hip, the little girl who could one day be so powerful all of Westeros was afraid of her. The little girl who had Stark and Lannister blood in her veins. </p><p>You never wanted her life to end this way. To such a simple illness Tommen could have survived dispite being so small the last time you saw him.</p><p>You could hear the door open as you were weaving the prayer wheel with the black thread, constantly looking up from the prayer wheel to look at Lucia\u2019s cadaverously pale face.</p><p>\u201cGet out.\u201d You said sternly as you pulled on the thread to tighten it around the center of the wheel. You could hear the person take a step forward. You wanted everyone to get away from Lucia. No one but you had the right to by her side right now. When whoever it was didn\u2019t leave you set the prayer wheel down in your lap and turned</p><p>\u201cI said get out!\u201d </p><p>You froze.</p><p>There he stood. Taller than you. His dark curls pulled back in a bun at the back of his head. Hair that was too short to be puled back fell loosely around the nape of his neck. His chest plate was silver with two dire wolf heads facing each other. He wore a vest like his father. The kind that had panels down to his knees as well. </p><p>His pale skin being lit up by the candle light in the dark stone room. His brown eyes looking at you. Your own eyes on him. He was older. A few scars on his face. One by his eyebrow that extended down his temple. And one going straight through his brow then stopping, before meeting his cheek. Whatever had done that to him missed his eye.</p><p>You slowly stood. You dress falling into place around your shins while you looked at him. You had no doubt he was studying how you had changed as well. Your golden hair in one solid braid like Sansa had done for you once before in Winterfell. He had seen the scar on your cheek. But he was to overwhelmed by the fact that you were hear. In front of him after so long.</p><p>Almost six years. And in those six years you had his child. The two of you had a little girl who was laying in a bed ill.</p><p>You didn\u2019t know what was doing it. Wether it was an instinct or if you legs just took over. His facial hair had grown slightly longer and thicker. His strangely shaped hairline on full display for you and everyone here to see. You stepped towards him. So close to him the tips of your shoes were touching.</p><p>You didn\u2019t know if this was a dream. He was here. Your hand reached up and cupped his cheek. It wasn\u2019t a dream. You knew that now. You could never dream up the expression he gave you. The happy look in his eyes as both of his hands cupped your cheeks, one of them following the clean scar on your cheek. He knew it had to have been a blade. It was too straight of a line for it to not be.</p><p>You smiled up at him.</p><p>\u201cWill Catelyn still ring your neck for talking to me?\u201d You asked with a sad smile. One of the first things he ever said to you was that he shouldn\u2019t be talking to you. That Catelyn Stark thought it was rude for a bastard to be in the presence of the royal family. That she\u2019d ring his neck for not only talking to you but for letting you hold one of his sparing swords.</p><p>He only smiled at you and pulled you in for a hug. His arms wrapping around your waist lifting you slightly while your arms wrapped around his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cMama\u2014\u201c </p><p>You let go of Jon and he let go of you when he heard the weak voice come from the bed. And when his eyes landed on his sickly looking daughter he could feel his heart throb. </p><p>You rushed over to her, moving the prayer wheel and checking her forehead.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong baby?\u201d You asked in a worried tone as you took her out of her covers and into your arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d She said in a raspy voice.</p><p>You looked to Jon as he walked over and took Lucia from your arms. \u201cI\u2019ll watch her. You get her some food.\u201d</p><p>You nodded as he held her small body in his arms. Her head lazily against his shoulder and her matching curls strewn around her face and shoulders.</p><p style=\"\"><br/></p><hr><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2Brpm_sNm4JG48MCv5LWYw\" target=\"_blank\">@siennarothenburg</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57PumL3XTHKMbhaLBCDM6Q\" target=\"_blank\">@nighthood13</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzBlNV0PDM4SXm6Ym1PSJAw\" target=\"_blank\">@cevanstann</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/majsdnQ_JnelNmwA-W4FunA\" target=\"_blank\">@boredbrit</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA_-qHoQbaPG0d8C94bexmA\" target=\"_blank\">@celestial-melancholy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrQghx2HTRQWATopqUw0s2w\" target=\"_blank\">@qhbr2013</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAeRnp4q0NBV8t7q1b6qpVw\" target=\"_blank\">@falling-stars-never-cry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms0BdTYfmHt42bvH5n-1KJw\" target=\"_blank\">@vxidnik</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY2iDPZFAYSCyrTHvpHNOmQ\" target=\"_blank\">@awkwxrdmarauders</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBWKqX0a6Xkb1gctJJJDd1g\" target=\"_blank\">@-thatgirloverthere-</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQcJ41Q73x6-KoyP-pxsiLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@starkbelova</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9cgOoG0Hpcm0odEGY0N9og\" target=\"_blank\">@lightbeautysblog</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN3t6WpcWC8Luy-RdOQ5m1w\" target=\"_blank\">@sillyoldbeleh</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mip0dTJRUDCmP8XbpMbKNtA\" target=\"_blank\">@honey-honey-boy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxYekjWCnH24z0QwoMRqFtg\" target=\"_blank\">@superbuckytrash</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkPX9bTS4_RT9JziquUBgpg\" target=\"_blank\">@camu-winchester</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY4tTcT1E_AqqiXU7UO0rUQ\" target=\"_blank\">@roger-bang-the-drum</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWMLSsKXRwPp1UkfyaHeR2g\" target=\"_blank\">@rebel4fandom</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg_AhM9FpeAUfhk1vcPXwQQ\" target=\"_blank\">@thegirlwithoutaname87</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBPqJYqesYaCjYq5L6I7eiQ\" target=\"_blank\">@nan-nie</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdVJdBYPzXOFB5rnDPVmekw\" target=\"_blank\">@liloefuru</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRvodjYPHYLY96n57ti7zEA\" target=\"_blank\">@mdgrdians</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEwIXFBDzVlkEJv3yfRxR9g\" target=\"_blank\">@misschief1996</a></p>",

Thats what her fever felt like. Her hair slicked back with sweat and her small body shivering despite how hot she felt to you. You draped a blanket over her small body as the white cat curled up her face very carefully as not to wake her.</p>[[MORE]]<p>You spent hours here. In this one position just staring at her. Watching as she tossed and turned in her uncomfortable sleep.</p><p>You remembered hearing how such a harsh fever could- could take her life. You were scared. This was the one thing you had been living for for the past five years. You went through hell for six months with Arya in the streets. Trying to protect her. Trying to keep you both fed. Trying to make sure your baby was okay every evening. </p><p>The day she was born was the worst and best day of your life. You had done it all alone. Gone through your pregnancy alone, gave birth alone in your room. You remembered catching her small body in your two hands. Two hands that nearly covered her body completely at the time. Now, your small hands barley covered her upper back. </p><p>There were so many reasons why Lucia was as short and skinny as she was. Partly because of you, mostly because of Joffrey. </p><p>You missed them. They were all dead. People you knew were dropping like flies. All the Baratheons were gone, all thanks to the affair your mother had with your uncle. If it weren\u2019t for her, you would have all been legitimate children of Robert\u2019s. Really and Stannis wouldn\u2019t have died fighting a war about who was the rightful heir to the throne.</p><p>Then the Targaryens. Because of your family only Daenerys was left. One went mad so they all had to die. </p><p>The Reynes. The believed they could be as powerful as the Lannisters. And your grandfather put a quick stop to that. Killing them all and handing their bodies around Casterly Rock for an entire summer. Men, women and babies. Even the handmaidens were killed. Everyone who your grandfather could get.</p><p>The Tyrells. Loras had been kind to you. Claiming Lucia as his own after being forced to marry you by your mother. You wanted to kill her for burning everyone. Only Olenna was left alive. She couldn\u2019t carry on the family name. She didn\u2019t have Tyrell blood, she had married into the family.</p><p>All of these people. They were all dead because of your family. Because of Tywin, Jaime and Joffrey.</p><p>You could hear the door open behind you. Not a squeak, just the sound of the handle being pushed into your chambers. The heavy door hitting against the stone walls of the room. Awoken by the sound, Ser Robb\u2019s head popped up and looked at the intruder.</p><p>You turned your head to see Missandei and one of the dothracki women, who you always saw with children following her.</p><p>\u201cLady Y/N, I have brought one of the Dothracki mothers. She would like to take a look at your daughter.\u201d</p><p>You looked at this stranger cautiously and moved aside from Lucia so she could see what was wrong with your daughter.</p><p>She took a few steps forward and looked over her. Resting the back of her hand on her forehead and looking over her small face. All the while speaking in Dothracki. Suddenly she stood and turned to Missandei speaking in her native tongue to her before leaving. Missandei\u2019s face dropped. Her eyes going to the little girl.</p><p>\u201cMissandei? What did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said she\u2019ll be lucky to see the sun rise and set tomorrow. But if she makes it to rise she\u2019ll live.\u201d You looked down to the stone flooring as she left very quickly after the dothracki woman. </p><p>You hadn\u2019t felt this feeling since you left Winterfell. The feeling of your heart breaking as you scooped her up in your arms, holding her close.</p><p>\u201cMama?\u201d She asked weakly not even opening her tired eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, little snow.\u201d You said choking back tears as you held her close to you.</p><p>\u201cCan you sing mama?\u201d</p><p>You nodded and was barley able to get out \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA raven flies from the north to the sea. A dragon whispers he name in the east. The Watcher waits on the northern wall. A daughter picks up a warrior\u2019s sword. A brother bound to a love he must hide. The younger\u2019s armor is worn in the mind, and a cold iron throne, used to hold two boys barley grown. And now it is known. A claim to the prize, a crown laced in lies. You win or you die.\u201d</p><p>You could feel her breathing even out as she fell asleep again. </p><p>You could remember everyone who made the largest impacts on your life. ANd you could clearly remember Catelyn. The thing she had made for Bran after his fall. How she had beckoned you over to help make one.</p><p>She had said only northern mothers make them for when their child is ill or is facing grave danger. And now, here you were. You remembered she called it a prayer wheel. She said that if you were to one day marry Robb, you should know how to make them for your own children if they were ever ill. And now here you were, weaving together a seven pointed star out of thread you had found in the chest in the corner Catelyn had made her\u2019s out of stick and cloth. Whatever she could find. You could only find rocks around the island. So you resorted to this. Threading it together like it was a flower crown. Something Olenna had taught you make whenever one of her handmaidens couldn\u2019t make one for Lucia. </p><p>You didn\u2019t know what the night would bring. Wether it was a dead daughter by sunrise who you\u2019d have to bury or a little girl who was ill, but would live.</p><p>The past five years, you\u2019d had nothing.Everything you ever had was stripped from you the moment you left Jon Snow. Any claim you could have made to the throne, becoming a mother to highborn children, which was never a thing you aspired to be.</p><p>The past five years all you had was a small child who held your hand everywhere you went. A small child who put back together your broken heart after Jon.</p><p>When you cried in your mother\u2019s arms it wasn\u2019t because you were scared.

Was \u00a0it the type of wether she had never been exposed to before? She had never really been outside much. Was that the problem? </p><p>You hadn\u2019t felt like this since the day she was born. Since she- Don\u2019t think about it. You felt like you failed her then, you felt like you were failing her now. Her fever was the highest you\u2019d ever seen. Tommen used to get some of the worst fevers whenever he was sick. She felt like the fire you had pulled her out of when she was just a baby. When the fire bit at your own skin. Thats what her fever felt like. Her hair slicked back with sweat and her small body shivering despite how hot she felt to you. You draped a blanket over her small body as the white cat curled up her face very carefully as not to wake her.</p>[[MORE]]<p>You spent hours here. In this one position just staring at her. Watching as she tossed and turned in her uncomfortable sleep.</p><p>You remembered hearing how such a harsh fever could- could take her life. You were scared. This was the one thing you had been living for for the past five years. You went through hell for six months with Arya in the streets. Trying to protect her. Trying to keep you both fed. Trying to make sure your baby was okay every evening. </p><p>The day she was born was the worst and best day of your life. You had done it all alone. Gone through your pregnancy alone, gave birth alone in your room. You remembered catching her small body in your two hands. Two hands that nearly covered her body completely at the time. Now, your small hands barley covered her upper back. </p><p>There were so many reasons why Lucia was as short and skinny as she was. Partly because of you, mostly because of Joffrey. </p><p>You missed them. They were all dead. People you knew were dropping like flies. All the Baratheons were gone, all thanks to the affair your mother had with your uncle. If it weren\u2019t for her, you would have all been legitimate children of Robert\u2019s. Really and Stannis wouldn\u2019t have died fighting a war about who was the rightful heir to the throne.</p><p>Then the Targaryens. Because of your family only Daenerys was left. One went mad so they all had to die. </p><p>The Reynes. The believed they could be as powerful as the Lannisters. And your grandfather put a quick stop to that. Killing them all and handing their bodies around Casterly Rock for an entire summer. Men, women and babies. Even the handmaidens were killed. Everyone who your grandfather could get.</p><p>The Tyrells. Loras had been kind to you. Claiming Lucia as his own after being forced to marry you by your mother. You wanted to kill her for burning everyone. Only Olenna was left alive. She couldn\u2019t carry on the family name. She didn\u2019t have Tyrell blood, she had married into the family.</p><p>All of these people. They were all dead because of your family. Because of Tywin, Jaime and Joffrey.</p><p>You could hear the door open behind you. Not a squeak, just the sound of the handle being pushed into your chambers. The heavy door hitting against the stone walls of the room. Awoken by the sound, Ser Robb\u2019s head popped up and looked at the intruder.</p><p>You turned your head to see Missandei and one of the dothracki women, who you always saw with children following her.</p><p>\u201cLady Y/N, I have brought one of the Dothracki mothers. She would like to take a look at your daughter.\u201d</p><p>You looked at this stranger cautiously and moved aside from Lucia so she could see what was wrong with your daughter.</p><p>She took a few steps forward and looked over her. Resting the back of her hand on her forehead and looking over her small face. All the while speaking in Dothracki. Suddenly she stood and turned to Missandei speaking in her native tongue to her before leaving. Missandei\u2019s face dropped. Her eyes going to the little girl.</p><p>\u201cMissandei? What did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said she\u2019ll be lucky to see the sun rise and set tomorrow. But if she makes it to rise she\u2019ll live.\u201d You looked down to the stone flooring as she left very quickly after the dothracki woman. </p><p>You hadn\u2019t felt this feeling since you left Winterfell. The feeling of your heart breaking as you scooped her up in your arms, holding her close.</p><p>\u201cMama?\u201d She asked weakly not even opening her tired eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, little snow.\u201d You said choking back tears as you held her close to you.</p><p>\u201cCan you sing mama?\u201d</p><p>You nodded and was barley able to get out \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA raven flies from the north to the sea. A dragon whispers he name in the east. The Watcher waits on the northern wall. A daughter picks up a warrior\u2019s sword. A brother bound to a love he must hide. The younger\u2019s armor is worn in the mind, and a cold iron throne, used to hold two boys barley grown. And now it is known. A claim to the prize, a crown laced in lies. You win or you die.\u201d</p><p>You could feel her breathing even out as she fell asleep again. </p><p>You could remember everyone who made the largest impacts on your life. ANd you could clearly remember Catelyn. The thing she had made for Bran after his fall. How she had beckoned you over to help make one.</p><p>She had said only northern mothers make them for when their child is ill or is facing grave danger. And now, here you were. You remembered she called it a prayer wheel. She said that if you were to one day marry Robb, you should know how to make them for your own children if they were ever ill. And now here you were, weaving together a seven pointed star out of thread you had found in the chest in the corner Catelyn had made her\u2019s out of stick and cloth. Whatever she could find. You could only find rocks around the island. So you resorted to this. Threading it together like it was a flower crown. Something Olenna had taught you make whenever one of her handmaidens couldn\u2019t make one for Lucia. </p><p>You didn\u2019t know what the night would bring. Wether it was a dead daughter by sunrise who you\u2019d have to bury or a little girl who was ill, but would live.</p><p>The past five years, you\u2019d had nothing.Everything you ever had was stripped from you the moment you left Jon Snow. Any claim you could have made to the throne, becoming a mother to highborn children, which was never a thing you aspired to be.</p><p>The past five years all you had was a small child who held your hand everywhere you went. A small child who put back together your broken heart after Jon.</p><p>When you cried in your mother\u2019s arms it wasn\u2019t because you were scared. You couldn\u2019t ever be scared to bring a child into the world. You weren\u2019t upset you were becoming a mother. You were crying because you didn\u2019t think you could do it without Jon by your side.</p><p>You never thought that someone you had met five years ago, and someone you had only known for a fortnight would have changed your life like he did, He looked at you as if there something in you worth looking at. He showed you what it meant to be loved. And you showed him that even a bastard could be loved. And in the end, he gave you a child. Something Tyrion often jokingly said was his parting gift to you.</p><p>You didn\u2019t think you could do it. Yet here you were. A sick child in front of you. A little girl who built you back up again after Joffrey had beaten you down, after you could no longer be with Jon. You had raised her. You named her and and you protected her to no end. </p><p>Someone so small, who had relied on your body to keep her safe for nine months and relied on you for so long to feed her, so long to keep her warm in your arms wrapped in a silk blanket. Someone so small, you could loose.</p><p>You could already feel your heart breaking at the thought of it. The thought of loosing Lucia to whatever illness she had. The strong little girl who could touch fire without being burnt, the brave little girl who was practically attached to you at the hip, the little girl who could one day be so powerful all of Westeros was afraid of her. The little girl who had Stark and Lannister blood in her veins. </p><p>You never wanted her life to end this way. To such a simple illness Tommen could have survived dispite being so small the last time you saw him.</p><p>You could hear the door open as you were weaving the prayer wheel with the black thread, constantly looking up from the prayer wheel to look at Lucia\u2019s cadaverously pale face.</p><p>\u201cGet out.\u201d You said sternly as you pulled on the thread to tighten it around the center of the wheel. You could hear the person take a step forward. You wanted everyone to get away from Lucia. No one but you had the right to by her side right now. When whoever it was didn\u2019t leave you set the prayer wheel down in your lap and turned</p><p>\u201cI said get out!\u201d </p><p>You froze.</p><p>There he stood. Taller than you. His dark curls pulled back in a bun at the back of his head. Hair that was too short to be puled back fell loosely around the nape of his neck. His chest plate was silver with two dire wolf heads facing each other. He wore a vest like his father. The kind that had panels down to his knees as well. </p><p>His pale skin being lit up by the candle light in the dark stone room. His brown eyes looking at you. Your own eyes on him. He was older. A few scars on his face. One by his eyebrow that extended down his temple. And one going straight through his brow then stopping, before meeting his cheek. Whatever had done that to him missed his eye.</p><p>You slowly stood. You dress falling into place around your shins while you looked at him. You had no doubt he was studying how you had changed as well. Your golden hair in one solid braid like Sansa had done for you once before in Winterfell. He had seen the scar on your cheek. But he was to overwhelmed by the fact that you were hear. In front of him after so long.</p><p>Almost six years. And in those six years you had his child. The two of you had a little girl who was laying in a bed ill.</p><p>You didn\u2019t know what was doing it. Wether it was an instinct or if you legs just took over. His facial hair had grown slightly longer and thicker. His strangely shaped hairline on full display for you and everyone here to see. You stepped towards him. So close to him the tips of your shoes were touching.</p><p>You didn\u2019t know if this was a dream. He was here. Your hand reached up and cupped his cheek. It wasn\u2019t a dream. You knew that now. You could never dream up the expression he gave you. The happy look in his eyes as both of his hands cupped your cheeks, one of them following the clean scar on your cheek. He knew it had to have been a blade. It was too straight of a line for it to not be.</p><p>You smiled up at him.</p><p>\u201cWill Catelyn still ring your neck for talking to me?\u201d You asked with a sad smile. One of the first things he ever said to you was that he shouldn\u2019t be talking to you. That Catelyn Stark thought it was rude for a bastard to be in the presence of the royal family. That she\u2019d ring his neck for not only talking to you but for letting you hold one of his sparing swords.</p><p>He only smiled at you and pulled you in for a hug. His arms wrapping around your waist lifting you slightly while your arms wrapped around his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cMama\u2014\u201c </p><p>You let go of Jon and he let go of you when he heard the weak voice come from the bed. And when his eyes landed on his sickly looking daughter he could feel his heart throb. </p><p>You rushed over to her, moving the prayer wheel and checking her forehead.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong baby?\u201d You asked in a worried tone as you took her out of her covers and into your arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d She said in a raspy voice.</p><p>You looked to Jon as he walked over and took Lucia from your arms. \u201cI\u2019ll watch her. You get her some food.\u201d</p><p>You nodded as he held her small body in his arms. Her head lazily against his shoulder and her matching curls strewn around her face and shoulders.</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><hr><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2Brpm_sNm4JG48MCv5LWYw\" target=\"_blank\">@siennarothenburg</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57PumL3XTHKMbhaLBCDM6Q\" target=\"_blank\">@nighthood13</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzBlNV0PDM4SXm6Ym1PSJAw\" target=\"_blank\">@cevanstann</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/majsdnQ_JnelNmwA-W4FunA\" target=\"_blank\">@boredbrit</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA_-qHoQbaPG0d8C94bexmA\" target=\"_blank\">@celestial-melancholy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrQghx2HTRQWATopqUw0s2w\" target=\"_blank\">@qhbr2013</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAeRnp4q0NBV8t7q1b6qpVw\" target=\"_blank\">@falling-stars-never-cry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms0BdTYfmHt42bvH5n-1KJw\" target=\"_blank\">@vxidnik</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY2iDPZFAYSCyrTHvpHNOmQ\" target=\"_blank\">@awkwxrdmarauders</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBWKqX0a6Xkb1gctJJJDd1g\" target=\"_blank\">@-thatgirloverthere-</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQcJ41Q73x6-KoyP-pxsiLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@starkbelova</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9cgOoG0Hpcm0odEGY0N9og\" target=\"_blank\">@lightbeautysblog</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN3t6WpcWC8Luy-RdOQ5m1w\" target=\"_blank\">@sillyoldbeleh</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mip0dTJRUDCmP8XbpMbKNtA\" target=\"_blank\">@honey-honey-boy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxYekjWCnH24z0QwoMRqFtg\" target=\"_blank\">@superbuckytrash</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkPX9bTS4_RT9JziquUBgpg\" target=\"_blank\">@camu-winchester</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY4tTcT1E_AqqiXU7UO0rUQ\" target=\"_blank\">@roger-bang-the-drum</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWMLSsKXRwPp1UkfyaHeR2g\" target=\"_blank\">@rebel4fandom</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg_AhM9FpeAUfhk1vcPXwQQ\" target=\"_blank\">@thegirlwithoutaname87</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBPqJYqesYaCjYq5L6I7eiQ\" target=\"_blank\">@nan-nie</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdVJdBYPzXOFB5rnDPVmekw\" target=\"_blank\">@liloefuru</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRvodjYPHYLY96n57ti7zEA\" target=\"_blank\">@mdgrdians</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEwIXFBDzVlkEJv3yfRxR9g\" target=\"_blank\">@misschief1996</a></p></p>",

To such a simple illness Tommen could have survived dispite being so small the last time you saw him.</p><p>You could hear the door open as you were weaving the prayer wheel with the black thread, constantly looking up from the prayer wheel to look at Lucia&rsquo;s cadaverously pale face.</p><p>&ldquo;Get out.&rdquo; You said sternly as you pulled on the thread to tighten it around the center of the wheel. You could hear the person take a step forward. You wanted everyone to get away from Lucia. No one but you had the right to by her side right now. When whoever it was didn&rsquo;t leave you set the prayer wheel down in your lap and turned</p><p>&ldquo;I said get out!&rdquo; </p><p>You froze.</p><p>There he stood. Taller than you. His dark curls pulled back in a bun at the back of his head. Hair that was too short to be puled back fell loosely around the nape of his neck. His chest plate was silver with two dire wolf heads facing each other. He wore a vest like his father. The kind that had panels down to his knees as well. </p><p>His pale skin being lit up by the candle light in the dark stone room. His brown eyes looking at you. Your own eyes on him. He was older. A few scars on his face. One by his eyebrow that extended down his temple. And one going straight through his brow then stopping, before meeting his cheek. Whatever had done that to him missed his eye.</p><p>You slowly stood. You dress falling into place around your shins while you looked at him. You had no doubt he was studying how you had changed as well. Your golden hair in one solid braid like Sansa had done for you once before in Winterfell. He had seen the scar on your cheek. But he was to overwhelmed by the fact that you were hear. In front of him after so long.</p><p>Almost six years. And in those six years you had his child. The two of you had a little girl who was laying in a bed ill.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t know what was doing it. Wether it was an instinct or if you legs just took over. His facial hair had grown slightly longer and thicker. His strangely shaped hairline on full display for you and everyone here to see. You stepped towards him. So close to him the tips of your shoes were touching.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t know if this was a dream. He was here. Your hand reached up and cupped his cheek. It wasn&rsquo;t a dream. You knew that now. You could never dream up the expression he gave you. The happy look in his eyes as both of his hands cupped your cheeks, one of them following the clean scar on your cheek. He knew it had to have been a blade. It was too straight of a line for it to not be.</p><p>You smiled up at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Will Catelyn still ring your neck for talking to me?&rdquo; You asked with a sad smile. One of the first things he ever said to you was that he shouldn&rsquo;t be talking to you. That Catelyn Stark thought it was rude for a bastard to be in the presence of the royal family. That she&rsquo;d ring his neck for not only talking to you but for letting you hold one of his sparing swords.</p><p>He only smiled at you and pulled you in for a hug. His arms wrapping around your waist lifting you slightly while your arms wrapped around his shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;Mama&mdash;&ldquo; </p><p>You let go of Jon and he let go of you when he heard the weak voice come from the bed. And when his eyes landed on his sickly looking daughter he could feel his heart throb. </p><p>You rushed over to her, moving the prayer wheel and checking her forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong baby?&rdquo; You asked in a worried tone as you took her out of her covers and into your arms.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry.&rdquo; She said in a raspy voice.</p><p>You looked to Jon as he walked over and took Lucia from your arms. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll watch her. You get her some food.&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded as he held her small body in his arms. Her head lazily against his shoulder and her matching curls strewn around her face and shoulders.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2Brpm_sNm4JG48MCv5LWYw\" target=\"_blank\">@siennarothenburg</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57PumL3XTHKMbhaLBCDM6Q\" target=\"_blank\">@nighthood13</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzBlNV0PDM4SXm6Ym1PSJAw\" target=\"_blank\">@cevanstann</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/majsdnQ_JnelNmwA-W4FunA\" target=\"_blank\">@boredbrit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA_-qHoQbaPG0d8C94bexmA\" target=\"_blank\">@celestial-melancholy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrQghx2HTRQWATopqUw0s2w\" target=\"_blank\">@qhbr2013</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAeRnp4q0NBV8t7q1b6qpVw\" target=\"_blank\">@falling-stars-never-cry</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms0BdTYfmHt42bvH5n-1KJw\" target=\"_blank\">@vxidnik</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY2iDPZFAYSCyrTHvpHNOmQ\" target=\"_blank\">@awkwxrdmarauders</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBWKqX0a6Xkb1gctJJJDd1g\" target=\"_blank\">@-thatgirloverthere-</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQcJ41Q73x6-KoyP-pxsiLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@starkbelova</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9cgOoG0Hpcm0odEGY0N9og\" target=\"_blank\">@lightbeautysblog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN3t6WpcWC8Luy-RdOQ5m1w\" target=\"_blank\">@sillyoldbeleh</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mip0dTJRUDCmP8XbpMbKNtA\" target=\"_blank\">@honey-honey-boy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxYekjWCnH24z0QwoMRqFtg\" target=\"_blank\">@superbuckytrash</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkPX9bTS4_RT9JziquUBgpg\" target=\"_blank\">@camu-winchester</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY4tTcT1E_AqqiXU7UO0rUQ\" target=\"_blank\">@roger-bang-the-drum</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWMLSsKXRwPp1UkfyaHeR2g\" target=\"_blank\">@rebel4fandom</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg_AhM9FpeAUfhk1vcPXwQQ\" target=\"_blank\">@thegirlwithoutaname87</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBPqJYqesYaCjYq5L6I7eiQ\" target=\"_blank\">@nan-nie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdVJdBYPzXOFB5rnDPVmekw\" target=\"_blank\">@liloefuru</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRvodjYPHYLY96n57ti7zEA\" target=\"_blank\">@mdgrdians</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEwIXFBDzVlkEJv3yfRxR9g\" target=\"_blank\">@misschief1996</a></p></p>",

Was that the problem? </p>\n<p>You hadn&rsquo;t felt like this since the day she was born. Since she- Don&rsquo;t think about it. You felt like you failed her then, you felt like you were failing her now. Her fever was the highest you&rsquo;d ever seen. Tommen used to get some of the worst fevers whenever he was sick. She felt like the fire you had pulled her out of when she was just a baby. When the fire bit at your own skin. Thats what her fever felt like. Her hair slicked back with sweat and her small body shivering despite how hot she felt to you. You draped a blanket over her small body as the white cat curled up her face very carefully as not to wake her.</p>\n</p>",
