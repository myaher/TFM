Also writing, poetry, basketball, food, youtube, and other stuff I'm sure. To clarify about BTS, I ship OT7 and all ships in between. But I don't believe they're real. If they come out, I'll fully support them however!",

After receiving the text, Jinhee rolled over in her bed, groaning. Having to do a full face of makeup in her suite-style bathroom was bound to turn out embarrassing or take forever, so instead of creating anxiety for herself by taking too long and making her suite mates wait, she went with the second best option: go to Hoseok and Seokjin\u2019s apartment using the spare key to do her makeup there.</p><p>She stood up, eyeing the nice dresses she had brought up from her weekend trip back home. They were originally for her performance midterms, but the strapless dark red dress with a sweetheart neckline seemed to match with her dark silver hair at the moment, as well as the occasion. Jinhee grabbed the dress, as well as her makeup bag and slipped on a pair of black heels so she could head over to Seokjin and Hoseok\u2019s to get ready.</p><p>The walk to Seokjin\u2019s apartment didn\u2019t take long, since it was only a block away from her own dorm, but the fact that they hadn\u2019t salted the streets had really made Jinhee struggle the whole way there, especially in heels that had no traction. The amount of times she had almost slipped had gone up to the double digits by the time she finally grabbed onto the gate of Seokjin and Hoseok\u2019s apartment complex and she couldn\u2019t help but feel annoyed at the snow.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, I will bring this up to Namjoon the next time he has a meeting with the Dean&hellip;\u201d Jinhee lifted up the little pot sitting outside of the 3-story complex, opening the front door and the door adjacent into Seokjin and Hoseok\u2019s apartment.</p><p>\u201cSeokjin, I don\u2019t care what narcissistic comment you have to say to yourself to get hyped for tonight, I\u2019m using your makeup mirror for my own purposes!\u201d Jinhee yelled into the apartment, seemingly a lot less sexually energized, considering what day it was.</p><p>\u201cAbut time you came!\u201d Seokjin\u2019s head peeked out from his room, a smile on his face after seeing Jinhee taking off her heels at the door. He eyed the garment bag in her hand, raising an eyebrow. \u201cWhat dress did you bring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ve never seen it, my mom brought it back after her trip.\u201d She shrugged, pulling it out of the bag. \u201cIt looked expensive, like I think it\u2019s around the same price point as the entrees at the restaurant Tae wants to take us to.\u201d She laughed, hanging the dress on the back of Seokjin\u2019s dorm so it wouldn\u2019t wrinkle. Seokjin\u2019s jaw dropped, not used to how nonchalant Jinhee was with money.</p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you just struggling to pay for that bag of chips yesterday? With pocket money change? What have you done with my Jinhee?\u201d He asked completely baffled, Jinhee shrugged again, pushing him out of the room so she could change.</p><p>\u201cI am broke! I have 3,000 KRW to my name right now!\u201d She yelled from the room, quickly changing into the dress. \u201cCan you help me zip up my dress though? I can do my makeup in here if you need the bathroom&hellip;\u201d Seokjin opened the door, seeing as Jinhee didn\u2019t bother to lock said door so that he could zip up her dress. His fingers gingerly touched her back, zipping up her dress carefully.</p><p>\u201cAll I need to do is style my hair, but why would you pull out this dress when you have some other cute dresses that aren\u2019t this&hellip;expensive?\u201d Seokjin spun her around, now making eye contact with her instead of him facing her back for her dress.</p><p>\u201cBecause!\u201d Jinhee whined a little, reaching for her makeup back. \u201cIf sugar daddy Taehyung wants me to look good, then you bet your ass I\u2019m gonna look good!\u201d She went to go sit down at Seokjin\u2019s vanity, carefully moving his makeup so that she could do her own. Seokjin cringed at her statement, running his fingers through his hair before sitting down on his bed.</p><p>\u201cJinhee, <i>please</i> don\u2019t call my bros that, especially when we both know Kim Taehyung is younger than you&hellip;\u201d Seokjin stood up once more, going to his closet and pulling a simple white dress shirt and a black blazer that had gold accents from the neckline down and closing with hooks at the torso from his closet. He went to go change in the bathroom as Jinhee beat her face, going for a red eye makeup look to match her dress, blending her eye shadow till her arms hurt. Once he came back out form changing, Jinhee was already putting on her eyeliner and her mascara. She looked up at him, giving him a thumbs up and a grin.</p><p>\u201cDamn, if I didn\u2019t know you were a crackhead, I would\u2019ve gone after you instead of\u2014\u201c Jinhee purposely cut herself off, silencing herself by applying mascara on her bottom lashes. Seokjin\u2019s eyebrow quirked, grinning.</p><p>\u201cOh? So Choi Jinhee, are you looking good per Kim Taehyung\u2019s orders, or for\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cKim Seokjin if you do not shut the FUCk U\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cJinhee? When did you get here?\u201d Hoseok walked into Seokjin\u2019s room, Jinhee scowling at Seokjin from his vanity and Seokjin grinning at her, leaning against the doorframe of his personal bathroom. \u201cDamn, baby girl cleans up well.\u201d Hoseok smirked at Jinhee, making her cheeks burn.</p><p>\u201cJung Hoseok, I will kick you out of this apartment and let Jinhee move in. Isn\u2019t flirting with y/n and teasing your Little enough for you?\u201d He glared at Hoseok, who only frowned in return.</p><p>\u201cSo I can\u2019t compliment girls anymore? You\u2019re so mean to me, Seokjinnie hyung&hellip;\u201d The pout was extremely prominent in Hoseok\u2019s voice, making Jinhee laugh as she applied her highlighter. Seokjin only rolled his eyes, giving Hoseok\u2019s outfit a once-over one more time. Hoseok was wearing a loose fitting white silk shirt and black dress pants with a design on them that you could only see with the lighting, hair parted so that there were light waves in his hair.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Hoseok.\u201d Seokjin smiled at Hoseok, his eyes traveling to Jinhee\u2019s shoes when she had come in. A pair of black suede lace up heels, they were almost 2 inches in length, something not really abnormal for her short stature, but Seokjin did applaud the fact that she walked to their apartment in those heels.</p><p>\u201cJinhee, you know that you\u2019re still gonna be shorter than both Jimin and Yoongi with these little heels, right?\u201d Seokjin\u2019s comment made Jinhee look up.</p><p>It took about 4 seconds till the comment registered, but when it sank in, Jinhee seemed to frizzle up like a Studio Ghibli character.</p><p>\u201cKIM SEOKJIN!\u201d Her voice rang loud, getting up to beat him up. If Seokjin didn\u2019t really know her, he\u2019d actually be scared of her beating him up, but there was a smile on her face when she came stomping over to him, so he only captured her in his arms easily, letting her squirm as the three of them laughed about his comment.</p><p>\u201cYou wear heels every day! No one\u2019s gonna notice how tall you\u2019ve gotten! Now let\u2019s go down, I wanna see you bust your shit outside,\u201d Seokjin listen Jinhee onto the floor again, the three of them going back out to the living room to get their coats and shoes on.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cOppa, what the fuck do I wear so it looks like I\u2019m rich or something?\u201d You frowned at your closet, going through it for what seemed like the 10th time in the last 5 minutes. Jimin groaned and sat up from your bed.</p><p>\u201cy/n, if you don\u2019t just pick a dress, we\u2019ll have to rush getting ready and you and I both know that we\u2019re going to take a while,\u201d he said running his hands through his hair. You made a sound of agreement and grabbed the blue dress in your closet that you wore for one of your sisters\u2019 24th. You carefully folded it into your bag which already occupied your makeup and hair bags as well as your heels and wore your coat, telling Jimin to fix your bed before leaving your dorm.</p><p>The two of you walked carefully across campus to his and Taehyung\u2019s dorm, the ice and snow on the ground making the usual 10 minute walk into 15 (you burst into laughter as Jimin slid and busted his ass, but quickly offered your hand to help him up). The moment you stepped out of the elevator onto Jimin\u2019s floor, you could hear the bass of a remix of \u201cA Good Night\u201d by John Legend. Jimin shook his head having no doubt in his mind that the music was coming from his dorm. \u201cGod, if Yoongi hyung wasn\u2019t our RA, we\u2019d have been kicked out by noise complaints by now.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung popped his head out of the bathroom at the sound of the door opening and closing, a smile forming once he met eyes with the two of you. He greeted you both brightly before ontinuing his skincare routine, singing along to whatever blasted on his speakers. Jimin turned down the music a bit, offering you his desk to set up your makeup equipment. You started moisturizing your skin as Jimin went to he bathroom, casually making conversation with Taehyung as he stripped and entered the shower.</p><p>Jimin took his time in the shower and by the time he finished and dried off, you were already starting your hair while Taehyung was scrolling through his Instagram feed on his bed. You turned to Taehyung, your lips pursed in thought. \u201cOppa, do you think I should wear hoops?\u201d</p><p>He eyed your makeup and waved hair, \u201cWhat does your dress look like?\u201d</p><p>Trilling your lips, you told him to wait as you shuffled to their bathroom, kicking Jimin out to change. He pouted in process, going to Taehyung\u2019s closet to pick out an outfit for tonight. They froze as you stepped out and turned to face them. Jimin looked at you, his eyes narrowing. \u201cDon\u2019t you think that dress is a little <i>too</i> short, y/n?\u201d</p><p>You scoffed and crossed your arms ass you stared at him, firing back almost immediately at the dressing boy, \u201cdon\u2019t you think your shirt is buttoned <i>too</i> low, Oppa?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung cackled at your comeback, \u201cI, for one, think you lot hot yet very classy. But something\u2019s missing besides the hoops,\u201d Your eyes followed Taehyung\u2019s movement as he stood and searched for a box by his desk. He hummed and pulled out two sets of jewelry, \u201cdo you want Swarovski or Pandora, y/n?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwarovski,\u201d you answered and thanked him as he attached the choker of diamonds to your neck. Taehyung smiled, \u201cThere you go. I also have some rings here that Jiminie likes to borrow, you can wear them too if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too kind to me, Oppa.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>On another floor, Kevin was scrolling through the earlier messages, barely remembering replying to the main group chat in the first place. His room was quiet, something he had always wished for on regular days, but still very appreciated. </p><p>Kevin squinted. A normal Thursday would never be this quiet. He looked at his phone again, seeing the day it was. Something in his head clicked about the day, making him shoot out of bed. Kim Taehyung had invited all of them to a fancy ass restaurant and he had about an hour to get ready. </p><p>He hopped out of bed, turning on his speaker on his bed and plugging his phone in. After settling for some old school Zion.T, he made his way to his closet, checking out his different selections. He had some nice clothes reserved for things like when Jinhee once dragged him to the opera or when he had some frat house events, but there was one shirt in his closet that he had never touched all year. </p><p>Considering what the item was, it was quite obvious why he hadn\u2019t worn it out yet &ndash; a plain white Gucci shirt with the signature Gucci snakes on the collar. Kevin grinned at the shirt choice, knowing Taehyung, the one with expensive taste, would definitely appreciate it. He grabbed the shirt, along with a pair of nicely pressed dress pants, his trusted brown belt, and his light brown pea coat, preparing for the night in his dorm. </p><p>Tucking his shirt into his pants, Kevin did a once over on his appearance in the mirror. He frowned, not satisfied with how his hairstyle didn\u2019t match with his outfit. How could anyone just have a fancy ass outfit and plain ass hair?</p><p>Opening his drawer, he grabbed the pomade, styling his hair till it looked presentable with the rest of his outfit. He really wanted to impress at least someone at the table who wasn\u2019t his sibling, Big, or idiotic best friends. Once he was done for real, he walked over to his phone, opening their group chat\u2019s map to track everyone\u2019s movement. Kevin watched Hoseok, Seokjin, and Jinhee\u2019s icons moving towards their dorm, where they agreed to meet to go to the restaurant. Carefully looping his belt through the loops, Kevin checked himself out one last time in the mirror before grabbing his phone, wallet, and keys. Slipping on his coat and some dress shoes, he locked the door before heading for the stairs to lightly jog down and wait in the lobby. </p><p>&ndash;</p><p>\u201cOh, there\u2019s Ke&ndash; OKAY BITCH POP OFF!\u201d Jinhee\u2019s voice rang loud when Kevin walked out of the building to wait in the front with the three, feeling embarrassed by how loud his best friend was. Hoseok only gave Kevin his brightest grin and a thumbs up, and Seokjin was busy texting initially until his soulmate had yelled, making him look up.</p><p>Kevin approached the three, Hoseok and Seokjin looking completely fine, Hoseok\u2019s coat even open, but Jinhee wrapped tightly in her own light gray pea coat, shivering slightly.</p><p>\u201cIs that fucking Gucci? Ugh, we love a man with taste.\u201d Seokjin grinned, lightly punching Kevin\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou know who\u2019s gonna appreciate that&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I spot king snake and an eye?\u201d Taehyung\u2019s excited voice cut off Seokjin, the said man running excitedly to their growing group of friends. Kevin smiled sheepishly, scratching the back of his neck nervously. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you got your hands on that! Literally every store I went to either sold out or didn\u2019t have the shirt in my size,\u201d Taehyung grinned lightly holding Kevin\u2019s shirt collar.</p><p>\u201cSo you can buy a Gucci shirt, but you can\u2019t go out with me for pho?\u201d you pouted crossing your arms.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re broke as fuck, what do you mean?\u201d Kevin pointed his finger at you, the group laughing as you agreed with him. You stood close to Jinhee, both of you trying to conserve warmth. </p><p>\u201cCan I join in on this little group hug?\u201d Hoseok smirked flirtatiously, his gaze making you zip up your jacket. Jinhee rolled her eyes, \u201cCan you go one day without hitting on us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh c\u2019mon, I\u2019m just teasing.\u201d He chuckled putting an arm around Jimin, \u201cbesides, I can\u2019t help it when both of you look like complete snacks.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really snack,\u201d Jinhee said nonchalantly deflecting his pick-up line, \u201cI\u2019m more like a 2 meals a day kind of girl.\u201d</p><p>Meanwhile, Taehyung began counting all of you, announcing that the uber should be there soon. \u201cYoongi, Namjoon, and Jungkook are running a bit late, they\u2019re going to meet us there.\u201d Seokjin announced, his lips pursing. \u201cThis is gonna be funny, considering Yoongi doesn\u2019t like driving, Namjoon doesn\u2019t have a license, and Jungkook doesn\u2019t have his car, but I\u2019m sure that lineage will find something out.\u201d The black SUV rolled up to the front of the dorm, the seven of you piling into the van.\u2014</p><p>You knew that the place that Taehyung chose was expensive, but this place was expensive expensive. The seven of you who were already at the restaurant looked around in wonder, attention divided between many things: the live music, the intricate art on the walls, hell, even the fountain in the middle and the greenery drew your attention away from the fact that this was a restaurant, and an expensive one at that.</p><p>Taehyung thanked the server as they showed you to your table, various plates stacked and utensils propped next to each other. Taehyung sat down first, Seokjin feeling quite obligated to sit next to his Little and saving the last three seats on their side of the table for the lineage missing. Across from Taehyung sat Kevin, Jimin next to him with Jinhee\u2019s chair basically attached to his, since Jimin was busy hugging the life out of Jinhee to warm her. Hoseok and you sat at the far opposite end of Taehyung, but you were excited to be accompanied by the lineage that was to come in soon. </p><p>You picked up the menu, your eyes almost bulging at the first thing your eyes landed on.The salad appetizer was equivalent to 22,000 KRW and you felt your heart almost drop at the price.</p><p>Those of you who weren\u2019t entitled to 500,000 KRW a week for allowance stared at the menu in shock, Taehyung on the other hand resembled a child on Christmas morning, excitedly looking over the pages. \u201cOh I can\u2019t wait to have a good steak and tuna tartare!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKev&hellip;do you want to just share something?\u201d you muttered, \u201cI barely have enough money in my bank to get a salad and soda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you forget that I\u2019m paying y/n?\u201d Taehyung grinned, \u201corder whatever the hell you want, it\u2019s no problem, really!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you absolutely sure about that?\u201d Hoseok asked, \u201cbecause you know that we eat like pigs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe my guest, we\u2019re eating good tonight ladies and gentlemen.\u201d</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>A few minutes after the seven of you ordered beverages (Seokjin used his ID to buy some cocktails for you underage kids - with the exception of Jinhee who didn\u2019t want to drink), three well-dressed boys walked to your table, each sporting different colors of royal blue, red, and grey. The boys of Beta Tau whistled as they greeted each other with high fives and hugs. </p><p>\u201cWow hold on, what happened to our baby Kook?\u201d Hoseok cheered, making you look up. You almost choked on your water, covering your mouth. Jungkook smiled shyly, taking the seat across from you. The three seats that you had left for the latecomers were all next to each other, so after Jungkook sat down, Namjoon sat to his left and Yoongi sat in between Seokjin and Namjoon.</p><p>\u201cI went over to Joon\u2019s apartment after taking care of Killmonger and Yeontan because someone said he needed a little daddy\u2019s time\u201d Yoongi squinted at Taehyung, \u201cand then the kid ran into his apartment panicked so we helped him out by making him look more grown.\u201d Yoongi grinned, his eyes flickering over the two huddled close together across from him before he looked at the youngest. Your gaze was also fixed on Jungkook, watching him play around with the hair that had been styled away from his eyes. Now that his hair was away from his eyes, you could see his doe eyes clearly, and they seemed to hold stars in them when he watched his Big or Grand talking. </p><p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for us, he\u2019d be wearing a white t-shirt and jeans.\u201d Namjoon chuckled, making Jungkook frown and cross his arms. </p><p>\u201cNamjoon hyung is so mean to me\u2026\u201d Jungkook pouted, directing his attention to you. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right, y/n? I can dress well when I want to\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cMm, considering you come to class every other day in monochromatic sweats, I don\u2019t really think I have the best place to be judging\u2026\u201d You let out a giggle when Jungkook only whined, rolling his eyes with a smile. The waiter came back with the drinks you all ordered beforehand, giving everyone an excuse to quiet down for a little bit. </p><p>\u201cIs there anything you have your eye out on, Chim?\u201d Jinhee\u2019s menu was propped up in between them, both willingly so they both could look at the menu and unwillingly since Jimin was still holding onto her, his arm not around her traveling up her leg. </p><p>\u201cMmm, nothing in particular, too bad they don\u2019t serve you on the menu,\u201d Jimin pouted, his hand stopping on her mid thigh. \u201cyou look like a complete meal that I\u2019d like to devour.\u201d Jimin winked at her, making her shiver. His hand continued to travel up her leg, two fingers walking higher instead of him just rubbing his hand on her thigh. Taking the opportunity, she stopped his hand from traveling her thigh by holding it in her hand, going back to looking at the menu. Jinhee shot Seokjin a panicked look, the oldest quirking a brow before rolling his eyes. </p><p>\u201cJiminie, why would you want to eat Jinhee?\u201d Seokjin\u2019s voice cut off Jimin\u2019s flirt, making Jimin look up as well. \u201cFirst of all, she wouldn\u2019t be very tasty, and also, why do that when there\u2019s lobster mac and cheese with truffle on this menu oh my go\u2014\u201c </p><p>\u201cMm, I think the phyllo wrapped halibut sounds good, I might order that.\u201d Jinhee cut off Seokjin\u2019s comment. She only nodded, a smile gracing her lips. \u201cAlso Chim, you can let go of me, I\u2019m warm enough now\u2026\u201d She giggled, slowly peeling away from Jimin. He only sighed, picking up his menu and looking through it on his own. Jinhee started to scoot away from Jimin, although her hand never really left his, the both of their hands clasped with each other. Yoongi took a glance at their hands, his lips only thinning into an unimpressed expression. </p><p>\u201cThis is why I don\u2019t like this day all that often\u2026\u201d He muttered, the only people who picked up on his comment being Namjoon and Seokjin seated next to him. Namjoon\u2019s mouth quirked into a small smile, entertained at how whipped his Big was for the girl. </p><p>The two at the opposite ends of the table, you and Jungkook and Kevin and Taehyung seemed to be in different worlds as the evening went on. Kevin and Taehyung were currently engrossed in a conversation of things that have happened in the past during Beta Tau parties and Taehyung\u2019s wild travel stories. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so sad,\u201d Taehyung frowned, resting his chin on his hand. \u201cI mean, traveling alone and/or with Tannie is always fun, but I want to travel with someone so I can take all these candids of them, you know? And they don\u2019t know until I develop them and then like give them in a shoe box or something like that. That\u2019s romantic, right?\u201d Taehyung looked up at Kevin, the younger\u2019s eyebrow only quirking. </p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take Jimin?\u201d Kevin asked carefully. Everyone knew that Jimin and Taehyung were soulmates, but they\u2019ve only traveled together once and it was less than a week. Taehyung covered his mouth, a small laugh coming from him. </p><p>\u201cKevin~ I said I wanted to do romantic things like kissing a significant other with the Eiffel Tower behind us, not losing Jiminie for a week and then reuniting.\u201d Taehyung explained. Kevin caught the use of the gender neutral term, but didn\u2019t think much about it. Maybe since he\u2019s international? </p><p>Kevin\u2019s train of thought was cut off when the waiter came back, asking for everyone\u2019s order at the table. One by one everyone ordered, Jungkook and Hoseok milking the most out of Taehyung\u2019s offer of free food, and everyone began talking across the table like normal. Taehyung stood up, holding his drink out to the others.</p><p>\u201cTo all the kinds of love out there! Happy Valentines day!\u201d You all clinked your glasses of drinks, drinking to Taehyung\u2019s toast. As the dinner went on, everyone was engrossed in different conversations, you and Jungkook especially in a conversation about the online game, Fortnite. </p><p>\u201cI mean, my favorite position is sniper, but I think it\u2019s just because I\u2019m too pussy to go out and seek people\u2026\u201d You laughed, shaking your head. \u201cLike, what if I turn a corner and the opposing team is there? Bam, I\u2019m dead!\u201d You frowned, your hands animating your demise. Jungkook only laughed at this, a smile growing on his face.</p><p>\u201cIs that so? We should play duos together then, I bet I could help you with that aspect. And then you can protect me from afar as a sniper!\u201d Jungkook smiled gleefully, his innocent smile in stark contrast to his deep silk v-neck. You were trying to not lose it on the opposite side of the table, but that thought only stayed in the back of your head as you continued talking to him. You shook your head, sighing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re like, probably a pro, there\u2019s a reason why you\u2019re known as the golden maknae of Beta Tau and why Jinhee calls you Ivy League Kook\u2026 I\u2019m not that good, I just think it\u2019s fun!\u201d You exhaled. Jungkook quirked a brow, tilting his head. It took everything in him to not jump over the table and kiss you, your pout was almost too much for him to handle. He smiled, but he wanted to change the subject before he could jump the table.</p><p>\u201cOh, that reminds me, I have a volleyball game coming up, you should come!\u201d Jungkook smiled, taking a sip of his water. You blinked at his sudden 180, tilting your head. </p><p>\u201cHuh? Kookie, I go to all your games, why would I miss it?\u201d You grinned. Jungkook only tilted his head, his smile only growing wider. \u201cBesides, I get free stuff hehe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, a constant I appreciate!\u201d Jungkook grinned at you, but before you guys could continue the conversation, the food had arrived to the table, and there was already talks about going back to 2seok\u2019s apartment for more drinks that weren\u2019t just fancy cocktails. You pursed your lips. Tonight was about to get more interesting.</p><p><i>-to be continued-</i></p><p><i>2-13-19</i></p>",

After receiving the text, Jinhee rolled over in her bed, groaning. Having to do a full face of makeup in her suite-style bathroom was bound to turn out embarrassing or take forever, so instead of creating anxiety for herself by taking too long and making her suite mates wait, she went with the second best option: go to Hoseok and Seokjin\u2019s apartment using the spare key to do her makeup there.</p><p>She stood up, eyeing the nice dresses she had brought up from her weekend trip back home. They were originally for her performance midterms, but the strapless dark red dress with a sweetheart neckline seemed to match with her dark silver hair at the moment, as well as the occasion. Jinhee grabbed the dress, as well as her makeup bag and slipped on a pair of black heels so she could head over to Seokjin and Hoseok\u2019s to get ready.</p><p>The walk to Seokjin\u2019s apartment didn\u2019t take long, since it was only a block away from her own dorm, but the fact that they hadn\u2019t salted the streets had really made Jinhee struggle the whole way there, especially in heels that had no traction. The amount of times she had almost slipped had gone up to the double digits by the time she finally grabbed onto the gate of Seokjin and Hoseok\u2019s apartment complex and she couldn\u2019t help but feel annoyed at the snow.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, I will bring this up to Namjoon the next time he has a meeting with the Dean\u2026\u201d Jinhee lifted up the little pot sitting outside of the 3-story complex, opening the front door and the door adjacent into Seokjin and Hoseok\u2019s apartment.</p><p>\u201cSeokjin, I don\u2019t care what narcissistic comment you have to say to yourself to get hyped for tonight, I\u2019m using your makeup mirror for my own purposes!\u201d Jinhee yelled into the apartment, seemingly a lot less sexually energized, considering what day it was.</p><p>\u201cAbut time you came!\u201d Seokjin\u2019s head peeked out from his room, a smile on his face after seeing Jinhee taking off her heels at the door. He eyed the garment bag in her hand, raising an eyebrow. \u201cWhat dress did you bring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ve never seen it, my mom brought it back after her trip.\u201d She shrugged, pulling it out of the bag. \u201cIt looked expensive, like I think it\u2019s around the same price point as the entrees at the restaurant Tae wants to take us to.\u201d She laughed, hanging the dress on the back of Seokjin\u2019s dorm so it wouldn\u2019t wrinkle. Seokjin\u2019s jaw dropped, not used to how nonchalant Jinhee was with money.</p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you just struggling to pay for that bag of chips yesterday? With pocket money change? What have you done with my Jinhee?\u201d He asked completely baffled, Jinhee shrugged again, pushing him out of the room so she could change.</p><p>\u201cI am broke! I have 3,000 KRW to my name right now!\u201d She yelled from the room, quickly changing into the dress. \u201cCan you help me zip up my dress though? I can do my makeup in here if you need the bathroom\u2026\u201d Seokjin opened the door, seeing as Jinhee didn\u2019t bother to lock said door so that he could zip up her dress. His fingers gingerly touched her back, zipping up her dress carefully.</p><p>\u201cAll I need to do is style my hair, but why would you pull out this dress when you have some other cute dresses that aren\u2019t this\u2026expensive?\u201d Seokjin spun her around, now making eye contact with her instead of him facing her back for her dress.</p><p>\u201cBecause!\u201d Jinhee whined a little, reaching for her makeup back. \u201cIf sugar daddy Taehyung wants me to look good, then you bet your ass I\u2019m gonna look good!\u201d She went to go sit down at Seokjin\u2019s vanity, carefully moving his makeup so that she could do her own. Seokjin cringed at her statement, running his fingers through his hair before sitting down on his bed.</p><p>\u201cJinhee, <i>please</i> don\u2019t call my bros that, especially when we both know Kim Taehyung is younger than you\u2026\u201d Seokjin stood up once more, going to his closet and pulling a simple white dress shirt and a black blazer that had gold accents from the neckline down and closing with hooks at the torso from his closet. He went to go change in the bathroom as Jinhee beat her face, going for a red eye makeup look to match her dress, blending her eye shadow till her arms hurt. Once he came back out form changing, Jinhee was already putting on her eyeliner and her mascara. She looked up at him, giving him a thumbs up and a grin.</p><p>\u201cDamn, if I didn\u2019t know you were a crackhead, I would\u2019ve gone after you instead of\u2014\u201c Jinhee purposely cut herself off, silencing herself by applying mascara on her bottom lashes. Seokjin\u2019s eyebrow quirked, grinning.</p><p>\u201cOh? So Choi Jinhee, are you looking good per Kim Taehyung\u2019s orders, or for\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cKim Seokjin if you do not shut the FUCk U\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cJinhee? When did you get here?\u201d Hoseok walked into Seokjin\u2019s room, Jinhee scowling at Seokjin from his vanity and Seokjin grinning at her, leaning against the doorframe of his personal bathroom. \u201cDamn, baby girl cleans up well.\u201d Hoseok smirked at Jinhee, making her cheeks burn.</p><p>\u201cJung Hoseok, I will kick you out of this apartment and let Jinhee move in. Isn\u2019t flirting with y/n and teasing your Little enough for you?\u201d He glared at Hoseok, who only frowned in return.</p><p>\u201cSo I can\u2019t compliment girls anymore? You\u2019re so mean to me, Seokjinnie hyung\u2026\u201d The pout was extremely prominent in Hoseok\u2019s voice, making Jinhee laugh as she applied her highlighter. Seokjin only rolled his eyes, giving Hoseok\u2019s outfit a once-over one more time. Hoseok was wearing a loose fitting white silk shirt and black dress pants with a design on them that you could only see with the lighting, hair parted so that there were light waves in his hair.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Hoseok.\u201d Seokjin smiled at Hoseok, his eyes traveling to Jinhee\u2019s shoes when she had come in. A pair of black suede lace up heels, they were almost 2 inches in length, something not really abnormal for her short stature, but Seokjin did applaud the fact that she walked to their apartment in those heels.</p><p>\u201cJinhee, you know that you\u2019re still gonna be shorter than both Jimin and Yoongi with these little heels, right?\u201d Seokjin\u2019s comment made Jinhee look up.</p><p>It took about 4 seconds till the comment registered, but when it sank in, Jinhee seemed to frizzle up like a Studio Ghibli character.</p><p>\u201cKIM SEOKJIN!\u201d Her voice rang loud, getting up to beat him up. If Seokjin didn\u2019t really know her, he\u2019d actually be scared of her beating him up, but there was a smile on her face when she came stomping over to him, so he only captured her in his arms easily, letting her squirm as the three of them laughed about his comment.</p><p>\u201cYou wear heels every day! No one\u2019s gonna notice how tall you\u2019ve gotten! Now let\u2019s go down, I wanna see you bust your shit outside,\u201d Seokjin listen Jinhee onto the floor again, the three of them going back out to the living room to get their coats and shoes on.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cOppa, what the fuck do I wear so it looks like I\u2019m rich or something?\u201d You frowned at your closet, going through it for what seemed like the 10th time in the last 5 minutes. Jimin groaned and sat up from your bed.</p><p>\u201cy/n, if you don\u2019t just pick a dress, we\u2019ll have to rush getting ready and you and I both know that we\u2019re going to take a while,\u201d he said running his hands through his hair. You made a sound of agreement and grabbed the blue dress in your closet that you wore for one of your sisters\u2019 24th. You carefully folded it into your bag which already occupied your makeup and hair bags as well as your heels and wore your coat, telling Jimin to fix your bed before leaving your dorm.</p><p>The two of you walked carefully across campus to his and Taehyung\u2019s dorm, the ice and snow on the ground making the usual 10 minute walk into 15 (you burst into laughter as Jimin slid and busted his ass, but quickly offered your hand to help him up). The moment you stepped out of the elevator onto Jimin\u2019s floor, you could hear the bass of a remix of \u201cA Good Night\u201d by John Legend. Jimin shook his head having no doubt in his mind that the music was coming from his dorm. \u201cGod, if Yoongi hyung wasn\u2019t our RA, we\u2019d have been kicked out by noise complaints by now.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung popped his head out of the bathroom at the sound of the door opening and closing, a smile forming once he met eyes with the two of you. He greeted you both brightly before ontinuing his skincare routine, singing along to whatever blasted on his speakers. Jimin turned down the music a bit, offering you his desk to set up your makeup equipment. You started moisturizing your skin as Jimin went to he bathroom, casually making conversation with Taehyung as he stripped and entered the shower.</p><p>Jimin took his time in the shower and by the time he finished and dried off, you were already starting your hair while Taehyung was scrolling through his Instagram feed on his bed. You turned to Taehyung, your lips pursed in thought. \u201cOppa, do you think I should wear hoops?\u201d</p><p>He eyed your makeup and waved hair, \u201cWhat does your dress look like?\u201d</p><p>Trilling your lips, you told him to wait as you shuffled to their bathroom, kicking Jimin out to change. He pouted in process, going to Taehyung\u2019s closet to pick out an outfit for tonight. They froze as you stepped out and turned to face them. Jimin looked at you, his eyes narrowing. \u201cDon\u2019t you think that dress is a little <i>too</i> short, y/n?\u201d</p><p>You scoffed and crossed your arms ass you stared at him, firing back almost immediately at the dressing boy, \u201cdon\u2019t you think your shirt is buttoned <i>too</i> low, Oppa?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung cackled at your comeback, \u201cI, for one, think you lot hot yet very classy. But something\u2019s missing besides the hoops,\u201d Your eyes followed Taehyung\u2019s movement as he stood and searched for a box by his desk. He hummed and pulled out two sets of jewelry, \u201cdo you want Swarovski or Pandora, y/n?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwarovski,\u201d you answered and thanked him as he attached the choker of diamonds to your neck. Taehyung smiled, \u201cThere you go. I also have some rings here that Jiminie likes to borrow, you can wear them too if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too kind to me, Oppa.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>On another floor, Kevin was scrolling through the earlier messages, barely remembering replying to the main group chat in the first place. His room was quiet, something he had always wished for on regular days, but still very appreciated. </p><p>Kevin squinted. A normal Thursday would never be this quiet. He looked at his phone again, seeing the day it was. Something in his head clicked about the day, making him shoot out of bed. Kim Taehyung had invited all of them to a fancy ass restaurant and he had about an hour to get ready. </p><p>He hopped out of bed, turning on his speaker on his bed and plugging his phone in. After settling for some old school Zion.T, he made his way to his closet, checking out his different selections. He had some nice clothes reserved for things like when Jinhee once dragged him to the opera or when he had some frat house events, but there was one shirt in his closet that he had never touched all year. </p><p>Considering what the item was, it was quite obvious why he hadn\u2019t worn it out yet \u2013 a plain white Gucci shirt with the signature Gucci snakes on the collar. Kevin grinned at the shirt choice, knowing Taehyung, the one with expensive taste, would definitely appreciate it. He grabbed the shirt, along with a pair of nicely pressed dress pants, his trusted brown belt, and his light brown pea coat, preparing for the night in his dorm. </p><p>Tucking his shirt into his pants, Kevin did a once over on his appearance in the mirror. He frowned, not satisfied with how his hairstyle didn\u2019t match with his outfit. How could anyone just have a fancy ass outfit and plain ass hair?</p><p>Opening his drawer, he grabbed the pomade, styling his hair till it looked presentable with the rest of his outfit. He really wanted to impress at least someone at the table who wasn\u2019t his sibling, Big, or idiotic best friends. Once he was done for real, he walked over to his phone, opening their group chat\u2019s map to track everyone\u2019s movement. Kevin watched Hoseok, Seokjin, and Jinhee\u2019s icons moving towards their dorm, where they agreed to meet to go to the restaurant. Carefully looping his belt through the loops, Kevin checked himself out one last time in the mirror before grabbing his phone, wallet, and keys. Slipping on his coat and some dress shoes, he locked the door before heading for the stairs to lightly jog down and wait in the lobby. </p><p>\u2013</p><p>\u201cOh, there\u2019s Ke\u2013 OKAY BITCH POP OFF!\u201d Jinhee\u2019s voice rang loud when Kevin walked out of the building to wait in the front with the three, feeling embarrassed by how loud his best friend was. Hoseok only gave Kevin his brightest grin and a thumbs up, and Seokjin was busy texting initially until his soulmate had yelled, making him look up.</p><p>Kevin approached the three, Hoseok and Seokjin looking completely fine, Hoseok\u2019s coat even open, but Jinhee wrapped tightly in her own light gray pea coat, shivering slightly.</p><p>\u201cIs that fucking Gucci? Ugh, we love a man with taste.\u201d Seokjin grinned, lightly punching Kevin\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou know who\u2019s gonna appreciate that\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I spot king snake and an eye?\u201d Taehyung\u2019s excited voice cut off Seokjin, the said man running excitedly to their growing group of friends. Kevin smiled sheepishly, scratching the back of his neck nervously. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you got your hands on that! Literally every store I went to either sold out or didn\u2019t have the shirt in my size,\u201d Taehyung grinned lightly holding Kevin\u2019s shirt collar.</p><p>\u201cSo you can buy a Gucci shirt, but you can\u2019t go out with me for pho?\u201d you pouted crossing your arms.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re broke as fuck, what do you mean?\u201d Kevin pointed his finger at you, the group laughing as you agreed with him. You stood close to Jinhee, both of you trying to conserve warmth. </p><p>\u201cCan I join in on this little group hug?\u201d Hoseok smirked flirtatiously, his gaze making you zip up your jacket. Jinhee rolled her eyes, \u201cCan you go one day without hitting on us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh c\u2019mon, I\u2019m just teasing.\u201d He chuckled putting an arm around Jimin, \u201cbesides, I can\u2019t help it when both of you look like complete snacks.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really snack,\u201d Jinhee said nonchalantly deflecting his pick-up line, \u201cI\u2019m more like a 2 meals a day kind of girl.\u201d</p><p>Meanwhile, Taehyung began counting all of you, announcing that the uber should be there soon. \u201cYoongi, Namjoon, and Jungkook are running a bit late, they\u2019re going to meet us there.\u201d Seokjin announced, his lips pursing. \u201cThis is gonna be funny, considering Yoongi doesn\u2019t like driving, Namjoon doesn\u2019t have a license, and Jungkook doesn\u2019t have his car, but I\u2019m sure that lineage will find something out.\u201d The black SUV rolled up to the front of the dorm, the seven of you piling into the van.\u2014</p><p>You knew that the place that Taehyung chose was expensive, but this place was expensive expensive. The seven of you who were already at the restaurant looked around in wonder, attention divided between many things: the live music, the intricate art on the walls, hell, even the fountain in the middle and the greenery drew your attention away from the fact that this was a restaurant, and an expensive one at that.</p><p>Taehyung thanked the server as they showed you to your table, various plates stacked and utensils propped next to each other. Taehyung sat down first, Seokjin feeling quite obligated to sit next to his Little and saving the last three seats on their side of the table for the lineage missing. Across from Taehyung sat Kevin, Jimin next to him with Jinhee\u2019s chair basically attached to his, since Jimin was busy hugging the life out of Jinhee to warm her. Hoseok and you sat at the far opposite end of Taehyung, but you were excited to be accompanied by the lineage that was to come in soon. </p><p>You picked up the menu, your eyes almost bulging at the first thing your eyes landed on.The salad appetizer was equivalent to 22,000 KRW and you felt your heart almost drop at the price.</p><p>Those of you who weren\u2019t entitled to 500,000 KRW a week for allowance stared at the menu in shock, Taehyung on the other hand resembled a child on Christmas morning, excitedly looking over the pages. \u201cOh I can\u2019t wait to have a good steak and tuna tartare!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKev\u2026do you want to just share something?\u201d you muttered, \u201cI barely have enough money in my bank to get a salad and soda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you forget that I\u2019m paying y/n?\u201d Taehyung grinned, \u201corder whatever the hell you want, it\u2019s no problem, really!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you absolutely sure about that?\u201d Hoseok asked, \u201cbecause you know that we eat like pigs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe my guest, we\u2019re eating good tonight ladies and gentlemen.\u201d</p><p>\u2013</p><p>A few minutes after the seven of you ordered beverages (Seokjin used his ID to buy some cocktails for you underage kids - with the exception of Jinhee who didn\u2019t want to drink), three well-dressed boys walked to your table, each sporting different colors of royal blue, red, and grey. The boys of Beta Tau whistled as they greeted each other with high fives and hugs. </p><p>\u201cWow hold on, what happened to our baby Kook?\u201d Hoseok cheered, making you look up. You almost choked on your water, covering your mouth. Jungkook smiled shyly, taking the seat across from you. The three seats that you had left for the latecomers were all next to each other, so after Jungkook sat down, Namjoon sat to his left and Yoongi sat in between Seokjin and Namjoon.</p><p>\u201cI went over to Joon\u2019s apartment after taking care of Killmonger and Yeontan because someone said he needed a little daddy\u2019s time\u201d Yoongi squinted at Taehyung, \u201cand then the kid ran into his apartment panicked so we helped him out by making him look more grown.\u201d Yoongi grinned, his eyes flickering over the two huddled close together across from him before he looked at the youngest. Your gaze was also fixed on Jungkook, watching him play around with the hair that had been styled away from his eyes. Now that his hair was away from his eyes, you could see his doe eyes clearly, and they seemed to hold stars in them when he watched his Big or Grand talking. </p><p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for us, he\u2019d be wearing a white t-shirt and jeans.\u201d Namjoon chuckled, making Jungkook frown and cross his arms. </p><p>\u201cNamjoon hyung is so mean to me\u2026\u201d Jungkook pouted, directing his attention to you. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right, y/n? I can dress well when I want to\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cMm, considering you come to class every other day in monochromatic sweats, I don\u2019t really think I have the best place to be judging\u2026\u201d You let out a giggle when Jungkook only whined, rolling his eyes with a smile. The waiter came back with the drinks you all ordered beforehand, giving everyone an excuse to quiet down for a little bit. </p><p>\u201cIs there anything you have your eye out on, Chim?\u201d Jinhee\u2019s menu was propped up in between them, both willingly so they both could look at the menu and unwillingly since Jimin was still holding onto her, his arm not around her traveling up her leg. </p><p>\u201cMmm, nothing in particular, too bad they don\u2019t serve you on the menu,\u201d Jimin pouted, his hand stopping on her mid thigh. \u201cyou look like a complete meal that I\u2019d like to devour.\u201d Jimin winked at her, making her shiver. His hand continued to travel up her leg, two fingers walking higher instead of him just rubbing his hand on her thigh. Taking the opportunity, she stopped his hand from traveling her thigh by holding it in her hand, going back to looking at the menu. Jinhee shot Seokjin a panicked look, the oldest quirking a brow before rolling his eyes. </p><p>\u201cJiminie, why would you want to eat Jinhee?\u201d Seokjin\u2019s voice cut off Jimin\u2019s flirt, making Jimin look up as well. \u201cFirst of all, she wouldn\u2019t be very tasty, and also, why do that when there\u2019s lobster mac and cheese with truffle on this menu oh my go\u2014\u201c </p><p>\u201cMm, I think the phyllo wrapped halibut sounds good, I might order that.\u201d Jinhee cut off Seokjin\u2019s comment. She only nodded, a smile gracing her lips. \u201cAlso Chim, you can let go of me, I\u2019m warm enough now\u2026\u201d She giggled, slowly peeling away from Jimin. He only sighed, picking up his menu and looking through it on his own. Jinhee started to scoot away from Jimin, although her hand never really left his, the both of their hands clasped with each other. Yoongi took a glance at their hands, his lips only thinning into an unimpressed expression. </p><p>\u201cThis is why I don\u2019t like this day all that often\u2026\u201d He muttered, the only people who picked up on his comment being Namjoon and Seokjin seated next to him. Namjoon\u2019s mouth quirked into a small smile, entertained at how whipped his Big was for the girl. </p><p>The two at the opposite ends of the table, you and Jungkook and Kevin and Taehyung seemed to be in different worlds as the evening went on. Kevin and Taehyung were currently engrossed in a conversation of things that have happened in the past during Beta Tau parties and Taehyung\u2019s wild travel stories. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so sad,\u201d Taehyung frowned, resting his chin on his hand. \u201cI mean, traveling alone and/or with Tannie is always fun, but I want to travel with someone so I can take all these candids of them, you know? And they don\u2019t know until I develop them and then like give them in a shoe box or something like that. That\u2019s romantic, right?\u201d Taehyung looked up at Kevin, the younger\u2019s eyebrow only quirking. </p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take Jimin?\u201d Kevin asked carefully. Everyone knew that Jimin and Taehyung were soulmates, but they\u2019ve only traveled together once and it was less than a week. Taehyung covered his mouth, a small laugh coming from him. </p><p>\u201cKevin~ I said I wanted to do romantic things like kissing a significant other with the Eiffel Tower behind us, not losing Jiminie for a week and then reuniting.\u201d Taehyung explained. Kevin caught the use of the gender neutral term, but didn\u2019t think much about it. Maybe since he\u2019s international? </p><p>Kevin\u2019s train of thought was cut off when the waiter came back, asking for everyone\u2019s order at the table. One by one everyone ordered, Jungkook and Hoseok milking the most out of Taehyung\u2019s offer of free food, and everyone began talking across the table like normal. Taehyung stood up, holding his drink out to the others.</p><p>\u201cTo all the kinds of love out there! Happy Valentines day!\u201d You all clinked your glasses of drinks, drinking to Taehyung\u2019s toast. As the dinner went on, everyone was engrossed in different conversations, you and Jungkook especially in a conversation about the online game, Fortnite. </p><p>\u201cI mean, my favorite position is sniper, but I think it\u2019s just because I\u2019m too pussy to go out and seek people\u2026\u201d You laughed, shaking your head. \u201cLike, what if I turn a corner and the opposing team is there? Bam, I\u2019m dead!\u201d You frowned, your hands animating your demise. Jungkook only laughed at this, a smile growing on his face.</p><p>\u201cIs that so? We should play duos together then, I bet I could help you with that aspect. And then you can protect me from afar as a sniper!\u201d Jungkook smiled gleefully, his innocent smile in stark contrast to his deep silk v-neck. You were trying to not lose it on the opposite side of the table, but that thought only stayed in the back of your head as you continued talking to him. You shook your head, sighing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re like, probably a pro, there\u2019s a reason why you\u2019re known as the golden maknae of Beta Tau and why Jinhee calls you Ivy League Kook\u2026 I\u2019m not that good, I just think it\u2019s fun!\u201d You exhaled. Jungkook quirked a brow, tilting his head. It took everything in him to not jump over the table and kiss you, your pout was almost too much for him to handle. He smiled, but he wanted to change the subject before he could jump the table.</p><p>\u201cOh, that reminds me, I have a volleyball game coming up, you should come!\u201d Jungkook smiled, taking a sip of his water. You blinked at his sudden 180, tilting your head. </p><p>\u201cHuh? Kookie, I go to all your games, why would I miss it?\u201d You grinned. Jungkook only tilted his head, his smile only growing wider. \u201cBesides, I get free stuff hehe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, a constant I appreciate!\u201d Jungkook grinned at you, but before you guys could continue the conversation, the food had arrived to the table, and there was already talks about going back to 2seok\u2019s apartment for more drinks that weren\u2019t just fancy cocktails. You pursed your lips. Tonight was about to get more interesting.</p><p><i>-to be continued-</i></p><p><i>2-13-19</i></p></p>",

After receiving the text, Jinhee rolled over in her bed, groaning. Having to do a full face of makeup in her suite-style bathroom was bound to turn out embarrassing or take forever, so instead of creating anxiety for herself by taking too long and making her suite mates wait, she went with the second best option: go to Hoseok and Seokjin\u2019s apartment using the spare key to do her makeup there.</p><p>She stood up, eyeing the nice dresses she had brought up from her weekend trip back home. They were originally for her performance midterms, but the strapless dark red dress with a sweetheart neckline seemed to match with her dark silver hair at the moment, as well as the occasion. Jinhee grabbed the dress, as well as her makeup bag and slipped on a pair of black heels so she could head over to Seokjin and Hoseok\u2019s to get ready.</p><p>The walk to Seokjin\u2019s apartment didn\u2019t take long, since it was only a block away from her own dorm, but the fact that they hadn\u2019t salted the streets had really made Jinhee struggle the whole way there, especially in heels that had no traction. The amount of times she had almost slipped had gone up to the double digits by the time she finally grabbed onto the gate of Seokjin and Hoseok\u2019s apartment complex and she couldn\u2019t help but feel annoyed at the snow.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, I will bring this up to Namjoon the next time he has a meeting with the Dean\u2026\u201d Jinhee lifted up the little pot sitting outside of the 3-story complex, opening the front door and the door adjacent into Seokjin and Hoseok\u2019s apartment.</p><p>\u201cSeokjin, I don\u2019t care what narcissistic comment you have to say to yourself to get hyped for tonight, I\u2019m using your makeup mirror for my own purposes!\u201d Jinhee yelled into the apartment, seemingly a lot less sexually energized, considering what day it was.</p><p>\u201cAbut time you came!\u201d Seokjin\u2019s head peeked out from his room, a smile on his face after seeing Jinhee taking off her heels at the door. He eyed the garment bag in her hand, raising an eyebrow. \u201cWhat dress did you bring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ve never seen it, my mom brought it back after her trip.\u201d She shrugged, pulling it out of the bag. \u201cIt looked expensive, like I think it\u2019s around the same price point as the entrees at the restaurant Tae wants to take us to.\u201d She laughed, hanging the dress on the back of Seokjin\u2019s dorm so it wouldn\u2019t wrinkle. Seokjin\u2019s jaw dropped, not used to how nonchalant Jinhee was with money.</p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you just struggling to pay for that bag of chips yesterday? With pocket money change? What have you done with my Jinhee?\u201d He asked completely baffled, Jinhee shrugged again, pushing him out of the room so she could change.</p><p>\u201cI am broke! I have 3,000 KRW to my name right now!\u201d She yelled from the room, quickly changing into the dress. \u201cCan you help me zip up my dress though? I can do my makeup in here if you need the bathroom\u2026\u201d Seokjin opened the door, seeing as Jinhee didn\u2019t bother to lock said door so that he could zip up her dress. His fingers gingerly touched her back, zipping up her dress carefully.</p><p>\u201cAll I need to do is style my hair, but why would you pull out this dress when you have some other cute dresses that aren\u2019t this\u2026expensive?\u201d Seokjin spun her around, now making eye contact with her instead of him facing her back for her dress.</p><p>\u201cBecause!\u201d Jinhee whined a little, reaching for her makeup back. \u201cIf sugar daddy Taehyung wants me to look good, then you bet your ass I\u2019m gonna look good!\u201d She went to go sit down at Seokjin\u2019s vanity, carefully moving his makeup so that she could do her own. Seokjin cringed at her statement, running his fingers through his hair before sitting down on his bed.</p><p>\u201cJinhee, <i>please</i> don\u2019t call my bros that, especially when we both know Kim Taehyung is younger than you\u2026\u201d Seokjin stood up once more, going to his closet and pulling a simple white dress shirt and a black blazer that had gold accents from the neckline down and closing with hooks at the torso from his closet. He went to go change in the bathroom as Jinhee beat her face, going for a red eye makeup look to match her dress, blending her eye shadow till her arms hurt. Once he came back out form changing, Jinhee was already putting on her eyeliner and her mascara. She looked up at him, giving him a thumbs up and a grin.</p><p>\u201cDamn, if I didn\u2019t know you were a crackhead, I would\u2019ve gone after you instead of\u2014\u201c Jinhee purposely cut herself off, silencing herself by applying mascara on her bottom lashes. Seokjin\u2019s eyebrow quirked, grinning.</p><p>\u201cOh? So Choi Jinhee, are you looking good per Kim Taehyung\u2019s orders, or for\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cKim Seokjin if you do not shut the FUCk U\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cJinhee? When did you get here?\u201d Hoseok walked into Seokjin\u2019s room, Jinhee scowling at Seokjin from his vanity and Seokjin grinning at her, leaning against the doorframe of his personal bathroom. \u201cDamn, baby girl cleans up well.\u201d Hoseok smirked at Jinhee, making her cheeks burn.</p><p>\u201cJung Hoseok, I will kick you out of this apartment and let Jinhee move in. Isn\u2019t flirting with y/n and teasing your Little enough for you?\u201d He glared at Hoseok, who only frowned in return.</p><p>\u201cSo I can\u2019t compliment girls anymore? You\u2019re so mean to me, Seokjinnie hyung\u2026\u201d The pout was extremely prominent in Hoseok\u2019s voice, making Jinhee laugh as she applied her highlighter. Seokjin only rolled his eyes, giving Hoseok\u2019s outfit a once-over one more time. Hoseok was wearing a loose fitting white silk shirt and black dress pants with a design on them that you could only see with the lighting, hair parted so that there were light waves in his hair.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Hoseok.\u201d Seokjin smiled at Hoseok, his eyes traveling to Jinhee\u2019s shoes when she had come in. A pair of black suede lace up heels, they were almost 2 inches in length, something not really abnormal for her short stature, but Seokjin did applaud the fact that she walked to their apartment in those heels.</p><p>\u201cJinhee, you know that you\u2019re still gonna be shorter than both Jimin and Yoongi with these little heels, right?\u201d Seokjin\u2019s comment made Jinhee look up.</p><p>It took about 4 seconds till the comment registered, but when it sank in, Jinhee seemed to frizzle up like a Studio Ghibli character.</p><p>\u201cKIM SEOKJIN!\u201d Her voice rang loud, getting up to beat him up. If Seokjin didn\u2019t really know her, he\u2019d actually be scared of her beating him up, but there was a smile on her face when she came stomping over to him, so he only captured her in his arms easily, letting her squirm as the three of them laughed about his comment.</p><p>\u201cYou wear heels every day! No one\u2019s gonna notice how tall you\u2019ve gotten! Now let\u2019s go down, I wanna see you bust your shit outside,\u201d Seokjin listen Jinhee onto the floor again, the three of them going back out to the living room to get their coats and shoes on.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cOppa, what the fuck do I wear so it looks like I\u2019m rich or something?\u201d You frowned at your closet, going through it for what seemed like the 10th time in the last 5 minutes. Jimin groaned and sat up from your bed.</p><p>\u201cy/n, if you don\u2019t just pick a dress, we\u2019ll have to rush getting ready and you and I both know that we\u2019re going to take a while,\u201d he said running his hands through his hair. You made a sound of agreement and grabbed the blue dress in your closet that you wore for one of your sisters\u2019 24th. You carefully folded it into your bag which already occupied your makeup and hair bags as well as your heels and wore your coat, telling Jimin to fix your bed before leaving your dorm.</p><p>The two of you walked carefully across campus to his and Taehyung\u2019s dorm, the ice and snow on the ground making the usual 10 minute walk into 15 (you burst into laughter as Jimin slid and busted his ass, but quickly offered your hand to help him up). The moment you stepped out of the elevator onto Jimin\u2019s floor, you could hear the bass of a remix of \u201cA Good Night\u201d by John Legend. Jimin shook his head having no doubt in his mind that the music was coming from his dorm. \u201cGod, if Yoongi hyung wasn\u2019t our RA, we\u2019d have been kicked out by noise complaints by now.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung popped his head out of the bathroom at the sound of the door opening and closing, a smile forming once he met eyes with the two of you. He greeted you both brightly before ontinuing his skincare routine, singing along to whatever blasted on his speakers. Jimin turned down the music a bit, offering you his desk to set up your makeup equipment. You started moisturizing your skin as Jimin went to he bathroom, casually making conversation with Taehyung as he stripped and entered the shower.</p><p>Jimin took his time in the shower and by the time he finished and dried off, you were already starting your hair while Taehyung was scrolling through his Instagram feed on his bed. You turned to Taehyung, your lips pursed in thought. \u201cOppa, do you think I should wear hoops?\u201d</p><p>He eyed your makeup and waved hair, \u201cWhat does your dress look like?\u201d</p><p>Trilling your lips, you told him to wait as you shuffled to their bathroom, kicking Jimin out to change. He pouted in process, going to Taehyung\u2019s closet to pick out an outfit for tonight. They froze as you stepped out and turned to face them. Jimin looked at you, his eyes narrowing. \u201cDon\u2019t you think that dress is a little <i>too</i> short, y/n?\u201d</p><p>You scoffed and crossed your arms ass you stared at him, firing back almost immediately at the dressing boy, \u201cdon\u2019t you think your shirt is buttoned <i>too</i> low, Oppa?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung cackled at your comeback, \u201cI, for one, think you lot hot yet very classy. But something\u2019s missing besides the hoops,\u201d Your eyes followed Taehyung\u2019s movement as he stood and searched for a box by his desk. He hummed and pulled out two sets of jewelry, \u201cdo you want Swarovski or Pandora, y/n?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwarovski,\u201d you answered and thanked him as he attached the choker of diamonds to your neck. Taehyung smiled, \u201cThere you go. I also have some rings here that Jiminie likes to borrow, you can wear them too if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too kind to me, Oppa.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>On another floor, Kevin was scrolling through the earlier messages, barely remembering replying to the main group chat in the first place. His room was quiet, something he had always wished for on regular days, but still very appreciated. </p><p>Kevin squinted. A normal Thursday would never be this quiet. He looked at his phone again, seeing the day it was. Something in his head clicked about the day, making him shoot out of bed. Kim Taehyung had invited all of them to a fancy ass restaurant and he had about an hour to get ready. </p><p>He hopped out of bed, turning on his speaker on his bed and plugging his phone in. After settling for some old school Zion.T, he made his way to his closet, checking out his different selections. He had some nice clothes reserved for things like when Jinhee once dragged him to the opera or when he had some frat house events, but there was one shirt in his closet that he had never touched all year. </p><p>Considering what the item was, it was quite obvious why he hadn\u2019t worn it out yet \u2013 a plain white Gucci shirt with the signature Gucci snakes on the collar. Kevin grinned at the shirt choice, knowing Taehyung, the one with expensive taste, would definitely appreciate it. He grabbed the shirt, along with a pair of nicely pressed dress pants, his trusted brown belt, and his light brown pea coat, preparing for the night in his dorm. </p><p>Tucking his shirt into his pants, Kevin did a once over on his appearance in the mirror. He frowned, not satisfied with how his hairstyle didn\u2019t match with his outfit. How could anyone just have a fancy ass outfit and plain ass hair?</p><p>Opening his drawer, he grabbed the pomade, styling his hair till it looked presentable with the rest of his outfit. He really wanted to impress at least someone at the table who wasn\u2019t his sibling, Big, or idiotic best friends. Once he was done for real, he walked over to his phone, opening their group chat\u2019s map to track everyone\u2019s movement. Kevin watched Hoseok, Seokjin, and Jinhee\u2019s icons moving towards their dorm, where they agreed to meet to go to the restaurant. Carefully looping his belt through the loops, Kevin checked himself out one last time in the mirror before grabbing his phone, wallet, and keys. Slipping on his coat and some dress shoes, he locked the door before heading for the stairs to lightly jog down and wait in the lobby. </p><p>\u2013</p><p>\u201cOh, there\u2019s Ke\u2013 OKAY BITCH POP OFF!\u201d Jinhee\u2019s voice rang loud when Kevin walked out of the building to wait in the front with the three, feeling embarrassed by how loud his best friend was. Hoseok only gave Kevin his brightest grin and a thumbs up, and Seokjin was busy texting initially until his soulmate had yelled, making him look up.</p><p>Kevin approached the three, Hoseok and Seokjin looking completely fine, Hoseok\u2019s coat even open, but Jinhee wrapped tightly in her own light gray pea coat, shivering slightly.</p><p>\u201cIs that fucking Gucci? Ugh, we love a man with taste.\u201d Seokjin grinned, lightly punching Kevin\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou know who\u2019s gonna appreciate that\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I spot king snake and an eye?\u201d Taehyung\u2019s excited voice cut off Seokjin, the said man running excitedly to their growing group of friends. Kevin smiled sheepishly, scratching the back of his neck nervously. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you got your hands on that! Literally every store I went to either sold out or didn\u2019t have the shirt in my size,\u201d Taehyung grinned lightly holding Kevin\u2019s shirt collar.</p><p>\u201cSo you can buy a Gucci shirt, but you can\u2019t go out with me for pho?\u201d you pouted crossing your arms.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re broke as fuck, what do you mean?\u201d Kevin pointed his finger at you, the group laughing as you agreed with him. You stood close to Jinhee, both of you trying to conserve warmth. </p><p>\u201cCan I join in on this little group hug?\u201d Hoseok smirked flirtatiously, his gaze making you zip up your jacket. Jinhee rolled her eyes, \u201cCan you go one day without hitting on us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh c\u2019mon, I\u2019m just teasing.\u201d He chuckled putting an arm around Jimin, \u201cbesides, I can\u2019t help it when both of you look like complete snacks.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really snack,\u201d Jinhee said nonchalantly deflecting his pick-up line, \u201cI\u2019m more like a 2 meals a day kind of girl.\u201d</p><p>Meanwhile, Taehyung began counting all of you, announcing that the uber should be there soon. \u201cYoongi, Namjoon, and Jungkook are running a bit late, they\u2019re going to meet us there.\u201d Seokjin announced, his lips pursing. \u201cThis is gonna be funny, considering Yoongi doesn\u2019t like driving, Namjoon doesn\u2019t have a license, and Jungkook doesn\u2019t have his car, but I\u2019m sure that lineage will find something out.\u201d The black SUV rolled up to the front of the dorm, the seven of you piling into the van.\u2014</p><p>You knew that the place that Taehyung chose was expensive, but this place was expensive expensive. The seven of you who were already at the restaurant looked around in wonder, attention divided between many things: the live music, the intricate art on the walls, hell, even the fountain in the middle and the greenery drew your attention away from the fact that this was a restaurant, and an expensive one at that.</p><p>Taehyung thanked the server as they showed you to your table, various plates stacked and utensils propped next to each other. Taehyung sat down first, Seokjin feeling quite obligated to sit next to his Little and saving the last three seats on their side of the table for the lineage missing. Across from Taehyung sat Kevin, Jimin next to him with Jinhee\u2019s chair basically attached to his, since Jimin was busy hugging the life out of Jinhee to warm her. Hoseok and you sat at the far opposite end of Taehyung, but you were excited to be accompanied by the lineage that was to come in soon. </p><p>You picked up the menu, your eyes almost bulging at the first thing your eyes landed on.The salad appetizer was equivalent to 22,000 KRW and you felt your heart almost drop at the price.</p><p>Those of you who weren\u2019t entitled to 500,000 KRW a week for allowance stared at the menu in shock, Taehyung on the other hand resembled a child on Christmas morning, excitedly looking over the pages. \u201cOh I can\u2019t wait to have a good steak and tuna tartare!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKev\u2026do you want to just share something?\u201d you muttered, \u201cI barely have enough money in my bank to get a salad and soda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you forget that I\u2019m paying y/n?\u201d Taehyung grinned, \u201corder whatever the hell you want, it\u2019s no problem, really!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you absolutely sure about that?\u201d Hoseok asked, \u201cbecause you know that we eat like pigs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe my guest, we\u2019re eating good tonight ladies and gentlemen.\u201d</p><p>\u2013</p><p>A few minutes after the seven of you ordered beverages (Seokjin used his ID to buy some cocktails for you underage kids - with the exception of Jinhee who didn\u2019t want to drink), three well-dressed boys walked to your table, each sporting different colors of royal blue, red, and grey. The boys of Beta Tau whistled as they greeted each other with high fives and hugs. </p><p>\u201cWow hold on, what happened to our baby Kook?\u201d Hoseok cheered, making you look up. You almost choked on your water, covering your mouth. Jungkook smiled shyly, taking the seat across from you. The three seats that you had left for the latecomers were all next to each other, so after Jungkook sat down, Namjoon sat to his left and Yoongi sat in between Seokjin and Namjoon.</p><p>\u201cI went over to Joon\u2019s apartment after taking care of Killmonger and Yeontan because someone said he needed a little daddy\u2019s time\u201d Yoongi squinted at Taehyung, \u201cand then the kid ran into his apartment panicked so we helped him out by making him look more grown.\u201d Yoongi grinned, his eyes flickering over the two huddled close together across from him before he looked at the youngest. Your gaze was also fixed on Jungkook, watching him play around with the hair that had been styled away from his eyes. Now that his hair was away from his eyes, you could see his doe eyes clearly, and they seemed to hold stars in them when he watched his Big or Grand talking. </p><p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for us, he\u2019d be wearing a white t-shirt and jeans.\u201d Namjoon chuckled, making Jungkook frown and cross his arms. </p><p>\u201cNamjoon hyung is so mean to me\u2026\u201d Jungkook pouted, directing his attention to you. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right, y/n? I can dress well when I want to\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cMm, considering you come to class every other day in monochromatic sweats, I don\u2019t really think I have the best place to be judging\u2026\u201d You let out a giggle when Jungkook only whined, rolling his eyes with a smile. The waiter came back with the drinks you all ordered beforehand, giving everyone an excuse to quiet down for a little bit. </p><p>\u201cIs there anything you have your eye out on, Chim?\u201d Jinhee\u2019s menu was propped up in between them, both willingly so they both could look at the menu and unwillingly since Jimin was still holding onto her, his arm not around her traveling up her leg. </p><p>\u201cMmm, nothing in particular, too bad they don\u2019t serve you on the menu,\u201d Jimin pouted, his hand stopping on her mid thigh. \u201cyou look like a complete meal that I\u2019d like to devour.\u201d Jimin winked at her, making her shiver. His hand continued to travel up her leg, two fingers walking higher instead of him just rubbing his hand on her thigh. Taking the opportunity, she stopped his hand from traveling her thigh by holding it in her hand, going back to looking at the menu. Jinhee shot Seokjin a panicked look, the oldest quirking a brow before rolling his eyes. </p><p>\u201cJiminie, why would you want to eat Jinhee?\u201d Seokjin\u2019s voice cut off Jimin\u2019s flirt, making Jimin look up as well. \u201cFirst of all, she wouldn\u2019t be very tasty, and also, why do that when there\u2019s lobster mac and cheese with truffle on this menu oh my go\u2014\u201c </p><p>\u201cMm, I think the phyllo wrapped halibut sounds good, I might order that.\u201d Jinhee cut off Seokjin\u2019s comment. She only nodded, a smile gracing her lips. \u201cAlso Chim, you can let go of me, I\u2019m warm enough now\u2026\u201d She giggled, slowly peeling away from Jimin. He only sighed, picking up his menu and looking through it on his own. Jinhee started to scoot away from Jimin, although her hand never really left his, the both of their hands clasped with each other. Yoongi took a glance at their hands, his lips only thinning into an unimpressed expression. </p><p>\u201cThis is why I don\u2019t like this day all that often\u2026\u201d He muttered, the only people who picked up on his comment being Namjoon and Seokjin seated next to him. Namjoon\u2019s mouth quirked into a small smile, entertained at how whipped his Big was for the girl. </p><p>The two at the opposite ends of the table, you and Jungkook and Kevin and Taehyung seemed to be in different worlds as the evening went on. Kevin and Taehyung were currently engrossed in a conversation of things that have happened in the past during Beta Tau parties and Taehyung\u2019s wild travel stories. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so sad,\u201d Taehyung frowned, resting his chin on his hand. \u201cI mean, traveling alone and/or with Tannie is always fun, but I want to travel with someone so I can take all these candids of them, you know? And they don\u2019t know until I develop them and then like give them in a shoe box or something like that. That\u2019s romantic, right?\u201d Taehyung looked up at Kevin, the younger\u2019s eyebrow only quirking. </p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take Jimin?\u201d Kevin asked carefully. Everyone knew that Jimin and Taehyung were soulmates, but they\u2019ve only traveled together once and it was less than a week. Taehyung covered his mouth, a small laugh coming from him. </p><p>\u201cKevin~ I said I wanted to do romantic things like kissing a significant other with the Eiffel Tower behind us, not losing Jiminie for a week and then reuniting.\u201d Taehyung explained. Kevin caught the use of the gender neutral term, but didn\u2019t think much about it. Maybe since he\u2019s international? </p><p>Kevin\u2019s train of thought was cut off when the waiter came back, asking for everyone\u2019s order at the table. One by one everyone ordered, Jungkook and Hoseok milking the most out of Taehyung\u2019s offer of free food, and everyone began talking across the table like normal. Taehyung stood up, holding his drink out to the others.</p><p>\u201cTo all the kinds of love out there! Happy Valentines day!\u201d You all clinked your glasses of drinks, drinking to Taehyung\u2019s toast. As the dinner went on, everyone was engrossed in different conversations, you and Jungkook especially in a conversation about the online game, Fortnite. </p><p>\u201cI mean, my favorite position is sniper, but I think it\u2019s just because I\u2019m too pussy to go out and seek people\u2026\u201d You laughed, shaking your head. \u201cLike, what if I turn a corner and the opposing team is there? Bam, I\u2019m dead!\u201d You frowned, your hands animating your demise. Jungkook only laughed at this, a smile growing on his face.</p><p>\u201cIs that so? We should play duos together then, I bet I could help you with that aspect. And then you can protect me from afar as a sniper!\u201d Jungkook smiled gleefully, his innocent smile in stark contrast to his deep silk v-neck. You were trying to not lose it on the opposite side of the table, but that thought only stayed in the back of your head as you continued talking to him. You shook your head, sighing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re like, probably a pro, there\u2019s a reason why you\u2019re known as the golden maknae of Beta Tau and why Jinhee calls you Ivy League Kook\u2026 I\u2019m not that good, I just think it\u2019s fun!\u201d You exhaled. Jungkook quirked a brow, tilting his head. It took everything in him to not jump over the table and kiss you, your pout was almost too much for him to handle. He smiled, but he wanted to change the subject before he could jump the table.</p><p>\u201cOh, that reminds me, I have a volleyball game coming up, you should come!\u201d Jungkook smiled, taking a sip of his water. You blinked at his sudden 180, tilting your head. </p><p>\u201cHuh? Kookie, I go to all your games, why would I miss it?\u201d You grinned. Jungkook only tilted his head, his smile only growing wider. \u201cBesides, I get free stuff hehe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, a constant I appreciate!\u201d Jungkook grinned at you, but before you guys could continue the conversation, the food had arrived to the table, and there was already talks about going back to 2seok\u2019s apartment for more drinks that weren\u2019t just fancy cocktails. You pursed your lips. Tonight was about to get more interesting.</p><p><i>-to be continued-</i></p><p><i>2-13-19</i></p></p>",

Having to do a full face of makeup in her suite-style bathroom was bound to turn out embarrassing or take forever, so instead of creating anxiety for herself by taking too long and making her suite mates wait, she went with the second best option: go to Hoseok and Seokjin&rsquo;s apartment using the spare key to do her makeup there.</p><p>She stood up, eyeing the nice dresses she had brought up from her weekend trip back home. They were originally for her performance midterms, but the strapless dark red dress with a sweetheart neckline seemed to match with her dark silver hair at the moment, as well as the occasion. Jinhee grabbed the dress, as well as her makeup bag and slipped on a pair of black heels so she could head over to Seokjin and Hoseok&rsquo;s to get ready.</p><p>The walk to Seokjin&rsquo;s apartment didn&rsquo;t take long, since it was only a block away from her own dorm, but the fact that they hadn&rsquo;t salted the streets had really made Jinhee struggle the whole way there, especially in heels that had no traction. The amount of times she had almost slipped had gone up to the double digits by the time she finally grabbed onto the gate of Seokjin and Hoseok&rsquo;s apartment complex and she couldn&rsquo;t help but feel annoyed at the snow.</p><p>&ldquo;Seriously, I will bring this up to Namjoon the next time he has a meeting with the Dean&hellip;&rdquo; Jinhee lifted up the little pot sitting outside of the 3-story complex, opening the front door and the door adjacent into Seokjin and Hoseok&rsquo;s apartment.</p><p>&ldquo;Seokjin, I don&rsquo;t care what narcissistic comment you have to say to yourself to get hyped for tonight, I&rsquo;m using your makeup mirror for my own purposes!&rdquo; Jinhee yelled into the apartment, seemingly a lot less sexually energized, considering what day it was.</p><p>&ldquo;Abut time you came!&rdquo; Seokjin&rsquo;s head peeked out from his room, a smile on his face after seeing Jinhee taking off her heels at the door. He eyed the garment bag in her hand, raising an eyebrow. &ldquo;What dress did you bring?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ve never seen it, my mom brought it back after her trip.&rdquo; She shrugged, pulling it out of the bag. &ldquo;It looked expensive, like I think it&rsquo;s around the same price point as the entrees at the restaurant Tae wants to take us to.&rdquo; She laughed, hanging the dress on the back of Seokjin&rsquo;s dorm so it wouldn&rsquo;t wrinkle. Seokjin&rsquo;s jaw dropped, not used to how nonchalant Jinhee was with money.</p><p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you just struggling to pay for that bag of chips yesterday? With pocket money change? What have you done with my Jinhee?&rdquo; He asked completely baffled, Jinhee shrugged again, pushing him out of the room so she could change.</p><p>&ldquo;I am broke! I have 3,000 KRW to my name right now!&rdquo; She yelled from the room, quickly changing into the dress. &ldquo;Can you help me zip up my dress though? I can do my makeup in here if you need the bathroom&hellip;&rdquo; Seokjin opened the door, seeing as Jinhee didn&rsquo;t bother to lock said door so that he could zip up her dress. His fingers gingerly touched her back, zipping up her dress carefully.</p><p>&ldquo;All I need to do is style my hair, but why would you pull out this dress when you have some other cute dresses that aren&rsquo;t this&hellip;expensive?&rdquo; Seokjin spun her around, now making eye contact with her instead of him facing her back for her dress.</p><p>&ldquo;Because!&rdquo; Jinhee whined a little, reaching for her makeup back. &ldquo;If sugar daddy Taehyung wants me to look good, then you bet your ass I&rsquo;m gonna look good!&rdquo; She went to go sit down at Seokjin&rsquo;s vanity, carefully moving his makeup so that she could do her own. Seokjin cringed at her statement, running his fingers through his hair before sitting down on his bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Jinhee, <i>please</i> don&rsquo;t call my bros that, especially when we both know Kim Taehyung is younger than you&hellip;&rdquo; Seokjin stood up once more, going to his closet and pulling a simple white dress shirt and a black blazer that had gold accents from the neckline down and closing with hooks at the torso from his closet. He went to go change in the bathroom as Jinhee beat her face, going for a red eye makeup look to match her dress, blending her eye shadow till her arms hurt. Once he came back out form changing, Jinhee was already putting on her eyeliner and her mascara. She looked up at him, giving him a thumbs up and a grin.</p><p>&ldquo;Damn, if I didn&rsquo;t know you were a crackhead, I would&rsquo;ve gone after you instead of&mdash;&ldquo; Jinhee purposely cut herself off, silencing herself by applying mascara on her bottom lashes. Seokjin&rsquo;s eyebrow quirked, grinning.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh? So Choi Jinhee, are you looking good per Kim Taehyung&rsquo;s orders, or for&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kim Seokjin if you do not shut the FUCk U&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jinhee? When did you get here?&rdquo; Hoseok walked into Seokjin&rsquo;s room, Jinhee scowling at Seokjin from his vanity and Seokjin grinning at her, leaning against the doorframe of his personal bathroom. &ldquo;Damn, baby girl cleans up well.&rdquo; Hoseok smirked at Jinhee, making her cheeks burn.</p><p>&ldquo;Jung Hoseok, I will kick you out of this apartment and let Jinhee move in. Isn&rsquo;t flirting with y/n and teasing your Little enough for you?&rdquo; He glared at Hoseok, who only frowned in return.</p><p>&ldquo;So I can&rsquo;t compliment girls anymore? You&rsquo;re so mean to me, Seokjinnie hyung&hellip;&rdquo; The pout was extremely prominent in Hoseok&rsquo;s voice, making Jinhee laugh as she applied her highlighter. Seokjin only rolled his eyes, giving Hoseok&rsquo;s outfit a once-over one more time. Hoseok was wearing a loose fitting white silk shirt and black dress pants with a design on them that you could only see with the lighting, hair parted so that there were light waves in his hair.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome, Hoseok.&rdquo; Seokjin smiled at Hoseok, his eyes traveling to Jinhee&rsquo;s shoes when she had come in. A pair of black suede lace up heels, they were almost 2 inches in length, something not really abnormal for her short stature, but Seokjin did applaud the fact that she walked to their apartment in those heels.</p><p>&ldquo;Jinhee, you know that you&rsquo;re still gonna be shorter than both Jimin and Yoongi with these little heels, right?&rdquo; Seokjin&rsquo;s comment made Jinhee look up.</p><p>It took about 4 seconds till the comment registered, but when it sank in, Jinhee seemed to frizzle up like a Studio Ghibli character.</p><p>&ldquo;KIM SEOKJIN!&rdquo; Her voice rang loud, getting up to beat him up. If Seokjin didn&rsquo;t really know her, he&rsquo;d actually be scared of her beating him up, but there was a smile on her face when she came stomping over to him, so he only captured her in his arms easily, letting her squirm as the three of them laughed about his comment.</p><p>&ldquo;You wear heels every day! No one&rsquo;s gonna notice how tall you&rsquo;ve gotten! Now let&rsquo;s go down, I wanna see you bust your shit outside,&rdquo; Seokjin listen Jinhee onto the floor again, the three of them going back out to the living room to get their coats and shoes on.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Oppa, what the fuck do I wear so it looks like I&rsquo;m rich or something?&rdquo; You frowned at your closet, going through it for what seemed like the 10th time in the last 5 minutes. Jimin groaned and sat up from your bed.</p><p>&ldquo;y/n, if you don&rsquo;t just pick a dress, we&rsquo;ll have to rush getting ready and you and I both know that we&rsquo;re going to take a while,&rdquo; he said running his hands through his hair. You made a sound of agreement and grabbed the blue dress in your closet that you wore for one of your sisters&rsquo; 24th. You carefully folded it into your bag which already occupied your makeup and hair bags as well as your heels and wore your coat, telling Jimin to fix your bed before leaving your dorm.</p><p>The two of you walked carefully across campus to his and Taehyung&rsquo;s dorm, the ice and snow on the ground making the usual 10 minute walk into 15 (you burst into laughter as Jimin slid and busted his ass, but quickly offered your hand to help him up). The moment you stepped out of the elevator onto Jimin&rsquo;s floor, you could hear the bass of a remix of &ldquo;A Good Night&rdquo; by John Legend. Jimin shook his head having no doubt in his mind that the music was coming from his dorm. &ldquo;God, if Yoongi hyung wasn&rsquo;t our RA, we&rsquo;d have been kicked out by noise complaints by now.&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung popped his head out of the bathroom at the sound of the door opening and closing, a smile forming once he met eyes with the two of you. He greeted you both brightly before ontinuing his skincare routine, singing along to whatever blasted on his speakers. Jimin turned down the music a bit, offering you his desk to set up your makeup equipment. You started moisturizing your skin as Jimin went to he bathroom, casually making conversation with Taehyung as he stripped and entered the shower.</p><p>Jimin took his time in the shower and by the time he finished and dried off, you were already starting your hair while Taehyung was scrolling through his Instagram feed on his bed. You turned to Taehyung, your lips pursed in thought. &ldquo;Oppa, do you think I should wear hoops?&rdquo;</p><p>He eyed your makeup and waved hair, &ldquo;What does your dress look like?&rdquo;</p><p>Trilling your lips, you told him to wait as you shuffled to their bathroom, kicking Jimin out to change. He pouted in process, going to Taehyung&rsquo;s closet to pick out an outfit for tonight. They froze as you stepped out and turned to face them. Jimin looked at you, his eyes narrowing. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that dress is a little <i>too</i> short, y/n?&rdquo;</p><p>You scoffed and crossed your arms ass you stared at him, firing back almost immediately at the dressing boy, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think your shirt is buttoned <i>too</i> low, Oppa?&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung cackled at your comeback, &ldquo;I, for one, think you lot hot yet very classy. But something&rsquo;s missing besides the hoops,&rdquo; Your eyes followed Taehyung&rsquo;s movement as he stood and searched for a box by his desk. He hummed and pulled out two sets of jewelry, &ldquo;do you want Swarovski or Pandora, y/n?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Swarovski,&rdquo; you answered and thanked him as he attached the choker of diamonds to your neck. Taehyung smiled, &ldquo;There you go. I also have some rings here that Jiminie likes to borrow, you can wear them too if you want.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too kind to me, Oppa.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>On another floor, Kevin was scrolling through the earlier messages, barely remembering replying to the main group chat in the first place. His room was quiet, something he had always wished for on regular days, but still very appreciated. </p><p>Kevin squinted. A normal Thursday would never be this quiet. He looked at his phone again, seeing the day it was. Something in his head clicked about the day, making him shoot out of bed. Kim Taehyung had invited all of them to a fancy ass restaurant and he had about an hour to get ready. </p><p>He hopped out of bed, turning on his speaker on his bed and plugging his phone in. After settling for some old school Zion.T, he made his way to his closet, checking out his different selections. He had some nice clothes reserved for things like when Jinhee once dragged him to the opera or when he had some frat house events, but there was one shirt in his closet that he had never touched all year. </p><p>Considering what the item was, it was quite obvious why he hadn&rsquo;t worn it out yet &ndash; a plain white Gucci shirt with the signature Gucci snakes on the collar. Kevin grinned at the shirt choice, knowing Taehyung, the one with expensive taste, would definitely appreciate it. He grabbed the shirt, along with a pair of nicely pressed dress pants, his trusted brown belt, and his light brown pea coat, preparing for the night in his dorm. </p><p>Tucking his shirt into his pants, Kevin did a once over on his appearance in the mirror. He frowned, not satisfied with how his hairstyle didn&rsquo;t match with his outfit. How could anyone just have a fancy ass outfit and plain ass hair?</p><p>Opening his drawer, he grabbed the pomade, styling his hair till it looked presentable with the rest of his outfit. He really wanted to impress at least someone at the table who wasn&rsquo;t his sibling, Big, or idiotic best friends. Once he was done for real, he walked over to his phone, opening their group chat&rsquo;s map to track everyone&rsquo;s movement. Kevin watched Hoseok, Seokjin, and Jinhee&rsquo;s icons moving towards their dorm, where they agreed to meet to go to the restaurant. Carefully looping his belt through the loops, Kevin checked himself out one last time in the mirror before grabbing his phone, wallet, and keys. Slipping on his coat and some dress shoes, he locked the door before heading for the stairs to lightly jog down and wait in the lobby. </p><p>&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s Ke&ndash; OKAY BITCH POP OFF!&rdquo; Jinhee&rsquo;s voice rang loud when Kevin walked out of the building to wait in the front with the three, feeling embarrassed by how loud his best friend was. Hoseok only gave Kevin his brightest grin and a thumbs up, and Seokjin was busy texting initially until his soulmate had yelled, making him look up.</p><p>Kevin approached the three, Hoseok and Seokjin looking completely fine, Hoseok&rsquo;s coat even open, but Jinhee wrapped tightly in her own light gray pea coat, shivering slightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that fucking Gucci? Ugh, we love a man with taste.&rdquo; Seokjin grinned, lightly punching Kevin&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;You know who&rsquo;s gonna appreciate that&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do I spot king snake and an eye?&rdquo; Taehyung&rsquo;s excited voice cut off Seokjin, the said man running excitedly to their growing group of friends. Kevin smiled sheepishly, scratching the back of his neck nervously. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you got your hands on that! Literally every store I went to either sold out or didn&rsquo;t have the shirt in my size,&rdquo; Taehyung grinned lightly holding Kevin&rsquo;s shirt collar.</p><p>&ldquo;So you can buy a Gucci shirt, but you can&rsquo;t go out with me for pho?&rdquo; you pouted crossing your arms.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re broke as fuck, what do you mean?&rdquo; Kevin pointed his finger at you, the group laughing as you agreed with him. You stood close to Jinhee, both of you trying to conserve warmth. </p><p>&ldquo;Can I join in on this little group hug?&rdquo; Hoseok smirked flirtatiously, his gaze making you zip up your jacket. Jinhee rolled her eyes, &ldquo;Can you go one day without hitting on us?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh c&rsquo;mon, I&rsquo;m just teasing.&rdquo; He chuckled putting an arm around Jimin, &ldquo;besides, I can&rsquo;t help it when both of you look like complete snacks.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really snack,&rdquo; Jinhee said nonchalantly deflecting his pick-up line, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m more like a 2 meals a day kind of girl.&rdquo;</p><p>Meanwhile, Taehyung began counting all of you, announcing that the uber should be there soon. &ldquo;Yoongi, Namjoon, and Jungkook are running a bit late, they&rsquo;re going to meet us there.&rdquo; Seokjin announced, his lips pursing. &ldquo;This is gonna be funny, considering Yoongi doesn&rsquo;t like driving, Namjoon doesn&rsquo;t have a license, and Jungkook doesn&rsquo;t have his car, but I&rsquo;m sure that lineage will find something out.&rdquo; The black SUV rolled up to the front of the dorm, the seven of you piling into the van.&mdash;</p><p>You knew that the place that Taehyung chose was expensive, but this place was expensive expensive. The seven of you who were already at the restaurant looked around in wonder, attention divided between many things: the live music, the intricate art on the walls, hell, even the fountain in the middle and the greenery drew your attention away from the fact that this was a restaurant, and an expensive one at that.</p><p>Taehyung thanked the server as they showed you to your table, various plates stacked and utensils propped next to each other. Taehyung sat down first, Seokjin feeling quite obligated to sit next to his Little and saving the last three seats on their side of the table for the lineage missing. Across from Taehyung sat Kevin, Jimin next to him with Jinhee&rsquo;s chair basically attached to his, since Jimin was busy hugging the life out of Jinhee to warm her. Hoseok and you sat at the far opposite end of Taehyung, but you were excited to be accompanied by the lineage that was to come in soon. </p><p>You picked up the menu, your eyes almost bulging at the first thing your eyes landed on.The salad appetizer was equivalent to 22,000 KRW and you felt your heart almost drop at the price.</p><p>Those of you who weren&rsquo;t entitled to 500,000 KRW a week for allowance stared at the menu in shock, Taehyung on the other hand resembled a child on Christmas morning, excitedly looking over the pages. &ldquo;Oh I can&rsquo;t wait to have a good steak and tuna tartare!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kev&hellip;do you want to just share something?&rdquo; you muttered, &ldquo;I barely have enough money in my bank to get a salad and soda.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you forget that I&rsquo;m paying y/n?&rdquo; Taehyung grinned, &ldquo;order whatever the hell you want, it&rsquo;s no problem, really!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you absolutely sure about that?&rdquo; Hoseok asked, &ldquo;because you know that we eat like pigs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Be my guest, we&rsquo;re eating good tonight ladies and gentlemen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>A few minutes after the seven of you ordered beverages (Seokjin used his ID to buy some cocktails for you underage kids - with the exception of Jinhee who didn&rsquo;t want to drink), three well-dressed boys walked to your table, each sporting different colors of royal blue, red, and grey. The boys of Beta Tau whistled as they greeted each other with high fives and hugs. </p><p>&ldquo;Wow hold on, what happened to our baby Kook?&rdquo; Hoseok cheered, making you look up. You almost choked on your water, covering your mouth. Jungkook smiled shyly, taking the seat across from you. The three seats that you had left for the latecomers were all next to each other, so after Jungkook sat down, Namjoon sat to his left and Yoongi sat in between Seokjin and Namjoon.</p><p>&ldquo;I went over to Joon&rsquo;s apartment after taking care of Killmonger and Yeontan because someone said he needed a little daddy&rsquo;s time&rdquo; Yoongi squinted at Taehyung, &ldquo;and then the kid ran into his apartment panicked so we helped him out by making him look more grown.&rdquo; Yoongi grinned, his eyes flickering over the two huddled close together across from him before he looked at the youngest. Your gaze was also fixed on Jungkook, watching him play around with the hair that had been styled away from his eyes. Now that his hair was away from his eyes, you could see his doe eyes clearly, and they seemed to hold stars in them when he watched his Big or Grand talking. </p><p>&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for us, he&rsquo;d be wearing a white t-shirt and jeans.&rdquo; Namjoon chuckled, making Jungkook frown and cross his arms. </p><p>&ldquo;Namjoon hyung is so mean to me&hellip;&rdquo; Jungkook pouted, directing his attention to you. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that right, y/n? I can dress well when I want to&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Mm, considering you come to class every other day in monochromatic sweats, I don&rsquo;t really think I have the best place to be judging&hellip;&rdquo; You let out a giggle when Jungkook only whined, rolling his eyes with a smile. The waiter came back with the drinks you all ordered beforehand, giving everyone an excuse to quiet down for a little bit. </p><p>&ldquo;Is there anything you have your eye out on, Chim?&rdquo; Jinhee&rsquo;s menu was propped up in between them, both willingly so they both could look at the menu and unwillingly since Jimin was still holding onto her, his arm not around her traveling up her leg. </p><p>&ldquo;Mmm, nothing in particular, too bad they don&rsquo;t serve you on the menu,&rdquo; Jimin pouted, his hand stopping on her mid thigh. &ldquo;you look like a complete meal that I&rsquo;d like to devour.&rdquo; Jimin winked at her, making her shiver. His hand continued to travel up her leg, two fingers walking higher instead of him just rubbing his hand on her thigh. Taking the opportunity, she stopped his hand from traveling her thigh by holding it in her hand, going back to looking at the menu. Jinhee shot Seokjin a panicked look, the oldest quirking a brow before rolling his eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Jiminie, why would you want to eat Jinhee?&rdquo; Seokjin&rsquo;s voice cut off Jimin&rsquo;s flirt, making Jimin look up as well. &ldquo;First of all, she wouldn&rsquo;t be very tasty, and also, why do that when there&rsquo;s lobster mac and cheese with truffle on this menu oh my go&mdash;&ldquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Mm, I think the phyllo wrapped halibut sounds good, I might order that.&rdquo; Jinhee cut off Seokjin&rsquo;s comment. She only nodded, a smile gracing her lips. &ldquo;Also Chim, you can let go of me, I&rsquo;m warm enough now&hellip;&rdquo; She giggled, slowly peeling away from Jimin. He only sighed, picking up his menu and looking through it on his own. Jinhee started to scoot away from Jimin, although her hand never really left his, the both of their hands clasped with each other. Yoongi took a glance at their hands, his lips only thinning into an unimpressed expression. </p><p>&ldquo;This is why I don&rsquo;t like this day all that often&hellip;&rdquo; He muttered, the only people who picked up on his comment being Namjoon and Seokjin seated next to him. Namjoon&rsquo;s mouth quirked into a small smile, entertained at how whipped his Big was for the girl. </p><p>The two at the opposite ends of the table, you and Jungkook and Kevin and Taehyung seemed to be in different worlds as the evening went on. Kevin and Taehyung were currently engrossed in a conversation of things that have happened in the past during Beta Tau parties and Taehyung&rsquo;s wild travel stories. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so sad,&rdquo; Taehyung frowned, resting his chin on his hand. &ldquo;I mean, traveling alone and/or with Tannie is always fun, but I want to travel with someone so I can take all these candids of them, you know? And they don&rsquo;t know until I develop them and then like give them in a shoe box or something like that. That&rsquo;s romantic, right?&rdquo; Taehyung looked up at Kevin, the younger&rsquo;s eyebrow only quirking. </p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you take Jimin?&rdquo; Kevin asked carefully. Everyone knew that Jimin and Taehyung were soulmates, but they&rsquo;ve only traveled together once and it was less than a week. Taehyung covered his mouth, a small laugh coming from him. </p><p>&ldquo;Kevin~ I said I wanted to do romantic things like kissing a significant other with the Eiffel Tower behind us, not losing Jiminie for a week and then reuniting.&rdquo; Taehyung explained. Kevin caught the use of the gender neutral term, but didn&rsquo;t think much about it. Maybe since he&rsquo;s international? </p><p>Kevin&rsquo;s train of thought was cut off when the waiter came back, asking for everyone&rsquo;s order at the table. One by one everyone ordered, Jungkook and Hoseok milking the most out of Taehyung&rsquo;s offer of free food, and everyone began talking across the table like normal. Taehyung stood up, holding his drink out to the others.</p><p>&ldquo;To all the kinds of love out there! Happy Valentines day!&rdquo; You all clinked your glasses of drinks, drinking to Taehyung&rsquo;s toast. As the dinner went on, everyone was engrossed in different conversations, you and Jungkook especially in a conversation about the online game, Fortnite. </p><p>&ldquo;I mean, my favorite position is sniper, but I think it&rsquo;s just because I&rsquo;m too pussy to go out and seek people&hellip;&rdquo; You laughed, shaking your head. &ldquo;Like, what if I turn a corner and the opposing team is there? Bam, I&rsquo;m dead!&rdquo; You frowned, your hands animating your demise. Jungkook only laughed at this, a smile growing on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that so? We should play duos together then, I bet I could help you with that aspect. And then you can protect me from afar as a sniper!&rdquo; Jungkook smiled gleefully, his innocent smile in stark contrast to his deep silk v-neck. You were trying to not lose it on the opposite side of the table, but that thought only stayed in the back of your head as you continued talking to him. You shook your head, sighing.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re like, probably a pro, there&rsquo;s a reason why you&rsquo;re known as the golden maknae of Beta Tau and why Jinhee calls you Ivy League Kook&hellip; I&rsquo;m not that good, I just think it&rsquo;s fun!&rdquo; You exhaled. Jungkook quirked a brow, tilting his head. It took everything in him to not jump over the table and kiss you, your pout was almost too much for him to handle. He smiled, but he wanted to change the subject before he could jump the table.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, that reminds me, I have a volleyball game coming up, you should come!&rdquo; Jungkook smiled, taking a sip of his water. You blinked at his sudden 180, tilting your head. </p><p>&ldquo;Huh? Kookie, I go to all your games, why would I miss it?&rdquo; You grinned. Jungkook only tilted his head, his smile only growing wider. &ldquo;Besides, I get free stuff hehe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, a constant I appreciate!&rdquo; Jungkook grinned at you, but before you guys could continue the conversation, the food had arrived to the table, and there was already talks about going back to 2seok&rsquo;s apartment for more drinks that weren&rsquo;t just fancy cocktails. You pursed your lips. Tonight was about to get more interesting.</p><p><i>-to be continued-</i></p><p><i>2-13-19</i></p></p>",

But I really like doing stories like this and hope to post more. And my request box is open!</p><!-- more --><p><b>SEOKJIN</b><br/></p><p>\u201cHow is it that someone as smart as you is so bad at\ndirections?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYa! What is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>With a raised eyebrow, you looked up at your boyfriend from\nwhere you were sat on the street curb. For the last ten minutes he had been\nmumbling to himself as he tried to figure out exactly where you were, and how\nto get back to where you were supposed to be. His phone dead, yours accidently\nleft at the hotel, and in a country that neither of you spoke the language, you\nwere essentially helpless.</p><p>Not that you minded being lost; going off the beaten was\nsometimes the best way to see a new place and you knew you\u2019d eventually find\nthe way back. But when you\u2019re supposed to be meeting the others for dinner and\nhad no way to contact them, well, that threw a wrench into the situation.</p><p>You huffed, finding it hard to be mad when he looked so\ncute. Finally you stood up, wiping the dirt off your pants and holding out your\nhand. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>Taking your hand without question, Jin allowed you to lead\nhim down the street. \u201cBut how do you know this is the right way?\u201d he pouted.</p><p>You smiled over your shoulder at him. \u201cI don\u2019t. But just\nsitting there isn\u2019t going to get us anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Hand in hand, you strolled down the cobbled streets, content\nin each other\u2019s company and enjoying the quiet buzz of the city.</p><p>As the shadows grew long along the streets, you finally reached\nthe seaside promenade, just as the sun was dipping below the horizon. You\ngasped in delight as the sky was set ablaze with fiery oranges and reds as the\nsun sunk melted into the dark ocean.</p><p>Strong arms circled your waist, and you leaned back into the\nembrace. Jin pressed a kiss into your before leaning his head against yours,\nsavoring the moment. </p><p>If every day ended like this, in a beautiful city with a\nbeautiful girl in his arms, he would get lost a thousand times over.</p><p>\u00a0<b>YOONGI</b></p><p>It was no secret that Yoongi\u2019s least favorite part of\ntravelling was having to go through the loud and sometimes pushy throng of fans\nwhen entering and leaving the airport. Some times were better than others, but\nevery time he would be on edge until it was over. But this time was different\nthan all the others, because for the first time you were travelling with the\nmembers as they set off on the next leg of their tour instead of meeting them in\nthe first city.</p><p>You relationship had been public for several months, but as\nyou both valued your privacy, you still kept your public appearances to a\nminimum. That meant that Yoongi didn\u2019t know how the fans would react, which made\nhim more nervous than usual. </p><p>As they prepared to exit the SUV that had brought them to\nthe airport, Yoongi looked over at you. \u201cNo matter what, just keep walking and never\nlet go of my hand, okay?\u201d</p><p>You nodded, leaning over to press a quick kiss to his lips. \u201cI\u2019ll\nnever let go, Jack.\u201d</p><p>You smiled in triumph as his shoulders dropped slightly,\nsome of the tension leaving his body at your corny line.</p><p>He nodded to Namjoon and Jungkook who were seated in the row\nahead of them that they were ready to go, and taking your hand, pulled you out\nof the car. </p><p>Your steps stuttered, momentarily stunned at the cacophony\nof noise and blinding flashes. You could see the company\u2019s security team on\neither side as you walked, but that didn\u2019t stop you from being jostled as some\nbrave fans tried to rush them in order to get closer to the members. But as\npromised, you held Yoongi\u2019s hand and followed his lead. </p><p>On the other side of airport security, you finally released\na breath you didn\u2019t realize you had been holding. Yoongi turned around, eyes\nscanned up and down your body. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He pulled you against his chest, holding you tight as he\npressed a kiss to your temple. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p><b>\u00a0</b><b>HOSEOK</b></p><p>It was no secret that Hoseok was the most fiercely protective\nmember of BTS. It didn\u2019t matter if you were his hyung or dongsaeng, if you were\nin need, he was there. It therefore was no surprise that that went tenfold for\nyou, his girlfriend. From the beginning, Hoseok had not wanted to hide your\nrelationship. As soon as knew that what you had together was more than a fling,\nhe went to management and informed them of his intentions of revealing that you\nwere dating. They wouldn\u2019t stop him but made sure that both he, and you,\nunderstood the potential consequences.</p><p>You were slowly becoming accustomed to near constant flash\nof lights and screams of fans anytime you stepped out in public with Hoseok. It\nwas jarring, and you don\u2019t know that you\u2019d ever be fully used to it, but you\nwere learning how to handle the attention.</p><p>Today was no different. You had flown out to be with the\ngroup for the last two cities on the European leg of the tour, and now you were\nall on the way back to Korea. After having been gone for the last three months,\nmanagement had told you to expect a big crowd at Incheon.</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s vicelike grip on your singular focus as he pulled\nyou behind him, your joined hands held at the small of his back. You were suddenly\nyanked backward, a shocked gasp escaping as you hit the ground. Fingernails dig\ninto your skin, sinking deep when you tried to yank your arm out of their\ngrasp.</p><p>\u201cLeave J-Hope. Leave him alone. He\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>You looked around, eyes filling with tears. \u201cPlease, let go.\nYou\u2019re hurting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave him. Do you hear me?\u201d You screamed as she yanked your\nhead, you neck painfully snapping back at the motion.</p><p>\u201cHands. Off,\u201d a deep voice growled from above you.</p><p>Even as the tears spilled, relief flooded your body at the\nsight of your boyfriend standing over you. </p><p>As the crazed fan reach for Hoseok, screaming his name,\nsecurity finally got to you, roughly pushing the girl away.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey,\u201d Hoseok said, his voice soft as he reached down,\ngently pulled you up and into his chest. \u201cI\u2019ve got you know. I\u2019m so sorry,\nbaby, so so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Tucking you his side and using his arm to cover your head, a\nsteely faced Hoseok led you the rest of the way out of the airport.</p><p>He pushed you up to the open door of the SUV, thankful to see\nYoongi\u2019s arm each out to help you into the car. He quickly followed you,\nwasting no time in taking you back into his arms.</p><p>\u201cHobi hyung, what happened back there?\u201d Jimin\u2019s quiet voice\nasked from the seats behind them, his hand reaching up to rest gently on the\ntop of your head.</p><p>\u201cSomeone from the crowd got throw security and knocked her\ndown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Y/N-noona,\u201d Taehyung whispered from beside Jimin.</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s heart clenched feeling you shake in his arms. He\ndon\u2019t know what went wrong but he vowed that nothing like that would ever\nhappen again, not as long he had something to say about it.</p><p><b>NAMJOON</b></p><p>Laying on your stomach, head resting on folded arms, you\nwatched with a fond smile as your overgrown kid of a boyfriend waded around in\nthe tidal pools closer to the water\u2019s edge. A weekend at the beach, a weekend\nto recharge and refill his creative well.</p><p>You weren\u2019t entirely sure how searching for crabs helped\nwith that, but you definitely weren\u2019t going to stop him. You were just thankful\nthat he was getting a break, knowing how much work he was putting into the\nlatest comeback. You rarely saw each other in daylight hours, often only\nexchanging a few words and tired kisses as one or the other of you slipped in\nor out of your shared bed. You weren\u2019t complaining, it came with the territory\nof being a relationship with an idol, but having him all to yourself for the\nnext 48 hours felt amazing.</p><p> \u201cJoon!\u201d you called. </p><p>You rolled over to your back, closing your eyes against the\nbright sun.</p><p>\u201cHey beautiful,\u201d Namjoon hummed as he crawled up your body.\nHolding himself up on his forearms, he dipped down, capturing your lips with\nhis own. \u201cYou lonely up here all by yourself?\u201d He nipped at your bottom lip, a\ncocky smirk playing against his own.</p><p>You playfully smacked his chest. \u201cOh my god that was so\ncringey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say, in that swimsuit you bring out the fuckboy\nin me.\u201d</p><p>Snaking your arms around his neck, you pulled him in for\nanother kiss. \u201cAlso cringey. But I\u2019m glad you like it. But right now I want you\nto take a nap with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAish, is that all I am to you, a glorified pillow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d you said, poking his cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re my\ninsanely talented, unbelievably attractive, wonderfully devoted love my life,\nwho just also happens to be the perfect cuddle buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, when you put in like that.\u201d </p><p>Namjoon rolled onto his side that you were facing each other,\nopening his arms, and you wasted no time in tucking yourself under his chin.\nHis hands gently stroked up and down your back. </p><p>\u201cThanks for coming with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine being anywhere else.\u201d</p><p>The warm air tangy with salt from the ocean breeze, the\nsounds of waves gently lapping against the shore- it didn\u2019t take long from your\nbreathing. Wrapped in the arms of the person who made you feel so loved and\nsafe. You don\u2019t remember the last time you felt this content, and you truly hoped\nNamjoon felt the same.</p><p><b>JIMIN</b><br/></p><p>Success was a double-edged sword. At the same time that\nJimin and his brothers worked hard to achieve their dreams, reaching milestones\nand breaking records in the process, it also became harder and harder to just be\nthemselves. With success came recognition, and with recognition came the nearly\nimpossible task of going out in public with ease.</p><p>It was something that Jimin was used to by this point, but\nhe knew it was still hard for you. Your life had changed the moment you agreed\nto go out on a first date with him but you had no regrets. Even though the\nrelationship was still new, you couldn\u2019t imagine your life without Jimin in it.</p><p>Your birthday was coming up, and he wanted to do something\nspecial for you, something where you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about cameras or\nprying eyes. That\u2019s when he remembered the new hot springs resort with rave\nreviews; it was perfect for a weekend getaway. Jimin was nervous, this was a\nfirst in your relationship, but seeing your eyes light up as you approached the\nresort made all his worries melt away.</p><p>Later than evening, a blissful sigh escaped your lips as\nslid deeper into the steaming water. \u201cOh my god,\u201d you moaned. \u201cIs this what\nheaven feels like?\u201d</p><p>Beside you, Jimin hummed in agreement. Glancing over, your\nbreath caught in your throat. In the soft moonlight, your boyfriend looked\nabsolutely ethereal; eyes closed, head tilted back to rest against the edge of\nthe spring, he could be a nymph out of an old fairytale. Not for the first\ntime, you found yourself stunned with the knowledge that he was yours. </p><p>Jimin cracked an eye open when he heard you moving, water\nrippling with your movement as you came to straddle his hips. Hands\ninstinctively went to your waist as he lifted his head up, drinking in the\nsight of you.</p><p>Your hands gently carded through his hair, brushing the damp\nlocks back as you dipped down to kiss him, slow and sweet. You leaned your forehead\nagainst his. \u201cI love you,\u201d you whispered, lips ghosting over his.</p><p> \u201cI love you too, so\nmuch.\u201d He reached up, hands gentle as he cupped your face. \u201cI want this to last\nforever.\u201d </p><p>You barely had time to take another breath before Jimin\npulled you down into another kiss, this time full of desperation and need. You\nwere putty in his hands, melting under his every touch, burning up in your love\nfor him.</p><p>It was a night of firsts, the first of many, one to always\nbe remembered.</p><p><b>TAEHYUNG</b></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all for an excuse to buy something new but I think this\nis a bit much,\u201d you whined at your boyfriend\u2019s back. You sat haphazardly on the\nchic leather sofa in the middle of the designer boutique as he flitted around\nthe store, the star-struck and slightly panicked sales associate scrambling\naround behind him to keep up.</p><p>\u201cOh my beautiful darling, you know how important this,\u201d\nTaehyung answered over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThe clothes we have are more than fine. I mean, you picked\nmost of them out, for both of us,\u201d you laughed.</p><p>\u201cThis is different though.\u201d He pulled out a dress, holding\nup it for your inspection. You shrugged indifferently, and after a second look,\nhe handed to the nearest associate. \u201cNeed to see it on,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>In just over a week the two of you were travelling to Paris\nfor Fashion Week. You had thought your boyfriend was going to have a stroke\nwhen he learned the news from his manager. As someone who loved fashion as much\nas Taehyung did, it was like a dream come true. You couldn\u2019t remember the last\ntime you\u2019d seen him this excited yet anxious. You knew this was a big deal, for\nseveral different reasons, but you couldn\u2019t help but worry that he was going overboard.\n</p><p>With a sigh, you got up from the sofa, motioning for a\nmoment alone and smiling thankfully as the sales associate left, bowing to you\nas they took their armfuls of clothing to the dressing room. </p><p>You wrapped your arms around Taehyung\u2019s waist, resting you\ncheek on his back. \u201cYou\u2019ve already been invited, Tae,\u201d you told him. \u201cYou\u2019ve\nalready impressed whoever it is that decides who gets an invite and who doesn\u2019t.\nAll you need to do is show up and be your utterly amazing self. They won\u2019t know\nwhat hit them.\u201d</p><p>You heard him sigh before finally relaxing under your touch.\nYou loosened your arms as he turned, wrapping his own around your shoulders and\npulling you to his chest. </p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he answered, chin rested on top of your head. \u201cI\ndon\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know why I want their validation. It\u2019s just fashion. It\nsounds so stupid now that I say it out loud.\u201d</p><p>You leaned back, looking up into his face. \u201cHey. It\u2019s not\nstupid. It\u2019s human nature to seek validation. You\u2019ve worked hard to hone your\nfashion and craft your image, it\u2019s only natural to want that hard work to be recognized,\nespecially when it\u2019s by people you admire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. For understanding,\u201d he whispered, leaning down\nto kiss the tip of your nose.</p><p>And the next week, after you saw the photos and magazine\narticles featuring Taehyung, and even a few with yourself, you knew that the\nnewest additions to your already overflowing closet were completely worth it.</p><p>\u00a0<b>JUNGKOOK</b></p><p>Even though you knew it was a survival mechanism brought on\nby idol life, of snatching precious moments of rest whenever you could, one of\nthe many things you admired about Jungkook was his ability to fall asleep\nalmost anywhere, at any time.</p><p>Halfway through the long flight and you hadn\u2019t been able to\ndo more than edit some pictures and videos on your laptop. Meanwhile, sprawled\nout in the reclined seat next to yours, your boyfriend slept, dead to the\nworld. Even though you were slightly jealous, you couldn\u2019t help but smile\nfondly at the man beside you. In his sleep, Jungkook looked even more like a\nbaby boy, something you loved to tease him about. <b></b></p><p>With a sigh, you stretched your arms overhead, groaning with\nsatisfaction as the motion pulled at the tight muscles in your back. You stood,\nglancing at the seats behind you where the other members were sat. Taehyung,\nYoongi, and Jin were also asleep. Namjoon was writing in his notebook, head\nbobbing to whatever beat he was listening to through his headphones. Hoseok and\nJimin were each on their phones but looked up when they noticed you standing,\nsilent glances asking if everything was okay. You smiled at them, assuring them\nyou were fine, miming that you were getting a drink, asking if they wanted one.\n</p><p>Carefully stepping over Jungkook\u2019s legs, you made your way\ntoward the front of the plane, asking one of the flight attendants for a Coke.\nYou chatted with them while you sipped your drink, always find their travel\nstories fascinating. </p><p>As you made your way back to your seat, you saw something\nthat made you stop, your blood running cold- the unmistakable sight of a\ncellphone angled towards your sleeping boyfriend. Your first instinct was to\ngrab the cellphone and bang it over the head of however was violating Jungkook\u2019s\nprivacy. But your second instinct, the one you followed, had you striding forward,\nstopping in front the offending cellphone.</p><p>The owner looked up, eyes wide when she realized who you\nwere. You knew who, or rather what, she was. She tried to put the phone back in\nher bag but you reached out, clamping a hand around her wrist. You leaned forward,\nvoice low and menacing. \u201cI see this playing out one of two ways. One, you\nwilling give me your phone and don\u2019t make a fuss when security comes over. Or\ntwo, you willing give me your phone and don\u2019t make a fuss when security comes\nover.\u201d You watch as she shakily retrieves the phone and drops into your waiting\nhand. </p><p>Schooling your features to not worry the members who were\nawake, you find the head of security and inform him of what happened. Only once\nthey move into the next section do you breathe a sigh of relief and sink back\ninto your seat.</p><p>Jungkook stirred besides you. \u201cYou okay, babe?\u201d he asks, voice\nstill gravelling with sleep.</p><p>\u201cBetter now,\u201d you answer, reaching over to smooth back his\nhair, hand resting on his cheek. \u201cGo back to sleep, Kookie, we\u2019ve got a few\nmore hours before landing.\u201d</p><p>He nods sleepily, taking your hand and pressing a kiss to\nthe back of it before almost immediately falling back to sleep.</p><p>You know he would find out soon enough, but for now, you\nwere happy to let him sleep in peace.</p>",

And my request box is open!</p>[[MORE]]<p><b>SEOKJIN</b><br></p><p>\u201cHow is it that someone as smart as you is so bad at\ndirections?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYa! What is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>With a raised eyebrow, you looked up at your boyfriend from\nwhere you were sat on the street curb. For the last ten minutes he had been\nmumbling to himself as he tried to figure out exactly where you were, and how\nto get back to where you were supposed to be. His phone dead, yours accidently\nleft at the hotel, and in a country that neither of you spoke the language, you\nwere essentially helpless.</p><p>Not that you minded being lost; going off the beaten was\nsometimes the best way to see a new place and you knew you\u2019d eventually find\nthe way back. But when you\u2019re supposed to be meeting the others for dinner and\nhad no way to contact them, well, that threw a wrench into the situation.</p><p>You huffed, finding it hard to be mad when he looked so\ncute. Finally you stood up, wiping the dirt off your pants and holding out your\nhand. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>Taking your hand without question, Jin allowed you to lead\nhim down the street. \u201cBut how do you know this is the right way?\u201d he pouted.</p><p>You smiled over your shoulder at him. \u201cI don\u2019t. But just\nsitting there isn\u2019t going to get us anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Hand in hand, you strolled down the cobbled streets, content\nin each other\u2019s company and enjoying the quiet buzz of the city.</p><p>As the shadows grew long along the streets, you finally reached\nthe seaside promenade, just as the sun was dipping below the horizon. You\ngasped in delight as the sky was set ablaze with fiery oranges and reds as the\nsun sunk melted into the dark ocean.</p><p>Strong arms circled your waist, and you leaned back into the\nembrace. Jin pressed a kiss into your before leaning his head against yours,\nsavoring the moment. </p><p>If every day ended like this, in a beautiful city with a\nbeautiful girl in his arms, he would get lost a thousand times over.</p><p>\u00a0<b>YOONGI</b></p><p>It was no secret that Yoongi\u2019s least favorite part of\ntravelling was having to go through the loud and sometimes pushy throng of fans\nwhen entering and leaving the airport. Some times were better than others, but\nevery time he would be on edge until it was over. But this time was different\nthan all the others, because for the first time you were travelling with the\nmembers as they set off on the next leg of their tour instead of meeting them in\nthe first city.</p><p>You relationship had been public for several months, but as\nyou both valued your privacy, you still kept your public appearances to a\nminimum. That meant that Yoongi didn\u2019t know how the fans would react, which made\nhim more nervous than usual. </p><p>As they prepared to exit the SUV that had brought them to\nthe airport, Yoongi looked over at you. \u201cNo matter what, just keep walking and never\nlet go of my hand, okay?\u201d</p><p>You nodded, leaning over to press a quick kiss to his lips. \u201cI\u2019ll\nnever let go, Jack.\u201d</p><p>You smiled in triumph as his shoulders dropped slightly,\nsome of the tension leaving his body at your corny line.</p><p>He nodded to Namjoon and Jungkook who were seated in the row\nahead of them that they were ready to go, and taking your hand, pulled you out\nof the car. </p><p>Your steps stuttered, momentarily stunned at the cacophony\nof noise and blinding flashes. You could see the company\u2019s security team on\neither side as you walked, but that didn\u2019t stop you from being jostled as some\nbrave fans tried to rush them in order to get closer to the members. But as\npromised, you held Yoongi\u2019s hand and followed his lead. </p><p>On the other side of airport security, you finally released\na breath you didn\u2019t realize you had been holding. Yoongi turned around, eyes\nscanned up and down your body. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He pulled you against his chest, holding you tight as he\npressed a kiss to your temple. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p><b>\u00a0</b><b>HOSEOK</b></p><p>It was no secret that Hoseok was the most fiercely protective\nmember of BTS. It didn\u2019t matter if you were his hyung or dongsaeng, if you were\nin need, he was there. It therefore was no surprise that that went tenfold for\nyou, his girlfriend. From the beginning, Hoseok had not wanted to hide your\nrelationship. As soon as knew that what you had together was more than a fling,\nhe went to management and informed them of his intentions of revealing that you\nwere dating. They wouldn\u2019t stop him but made sure that both he, and you,\nunderstood the potential consequences.</p><p>You were slowly becoming accustomed to near constant flash\nof lights and screams of fans anytime you stepped out in public with Hoseok. It\nwas jarring, and you don\u2019t know that you\u2019d ever be fully used to it, but you\nwere learning how to handle the attention.</p><p>Today was no different. You had flown out to be with the\ngroup for the last two cities on the European leg of the tour, and now you were\nall on the way back to Korea. After having been gone for the last three months,\nmanagement had told you to expect a big crowd at Incheon.</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s vicelike grip on your singular focus as he pulled\nyou behind him, your joined hands held at the small of his back. You were suddenly\nyanked backward, a shocked gasp escaping as you hit the ground. Fingernails dig\ninto your skin, sinking deep when you tried to yank your arm out of their\ngrasp.</p><p>\u201cLeave J-Hope. Leave him alone. He\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>You looked around, eyes filling with tears. \u201cPlease, let go.\nYou\u2019re hurting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave him. Do you hear me?\u201d You screamed as she yanked your\nhead, you neck painfully snapping back at the motion.</p><p>\u201cHands. Off,\u201d a deep voice growled from above you.</p><p>Even as the tears spilled, relief flooded your body at the\nsight of your boyfriend standing over you. </p><p>As the crazed fan reach for Hoseok, screaming his name,\nsecurity finally got to you, roughly pushing the girl away.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey,\u201d Hoseok said, his voice soft as he reached down,\ngently pulled you up and into his chest. \u201cI\u2019ve got you know. I\u2019m so sorry,\nbaby, so so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Tucking you his side and using his arm to cover your head, a\nsteely faced Hoseok led you the rest of the way out of the airport.</p><p>He pushed you up to the open door of the SUV, thankful to see\nYoongi\u2019s arm each out to help you into the car. He quickly followed you,\nwasting no time in taking you back into his arms.</p><p>\u201cHobi hyung, what happened back there?\u201d Jimin\u2019s quiet voice\nasked from the seats behind them, his hand reaching up to rest gently on the\ntop of your head.</p><p>\u201cSomeone from the crowd got throw security and knocked her\ndown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Y/N-noona,\u201d Taehyung whispered from beside Jimin.</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s heart clenched feeling you shake in his arms. He\ndon\u2019t know what went wrong but he vowed that nothing like that would ever\nhappen again, not as long he had something to say about it.</p><p><b>NAMJOON</b></p><p>Laying on your stomach, head resting on folded arms, you\nwatched with a fond smile as your overgrown kid of a boyfriend waded around in\nthe tidal pools closer to the water\u2019s edge. A weekend at the beach, a weekend\nto recharge and refill his creative well.</p><p>You weren\u2019t entirely sure how searching for crabs helped\nwith that, but you definitely weren\u2019t going to stop him. You were just thankful\nthat he was getting a break, knowing how much work he was putting into the\nlatest comeback. You rarely saw each other in daylight hours, often only\nexchanging a few words and tired kisses as one or the other of you slipped in\nor out of your shared bed. You weren\u2019t complaining, it came with the territory\nof being a relationship with an idol, but having him all to yourself for the\nnext 48 hours felt amazing.</p><p> \u201cJoon!\u201d you called. </p><p>You rolled over to your back, closing your eyes against the\nbright sun.</p><p>\u201cHey beautiful,\u201d Namjoon hummed as he crawled up your body.\nHolding himself up on his forearms, he dipped down, capturing your lips with\nhis own. \u201cYou lonely up here all by yourself?\u201d He nipped at your bottom lip, a\ncocky smirk playing against his own.</p><p>You playfully smacked his chest. \u201cOh my god that was so\ncringey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say, in that swimsuit you bring out the fuckboy\nin me.\u201d</p><p>Snaking your arms around his neck, you pulled him in for\nanother kiss. \u201cAlso cringey. But I\u2019m glad you like it. But right now I want you\nto take a nap with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAish, is that all I am to you, a glorified pillow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d you said, poking his cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re my\ninsanely talented, unbelievably attractive, wonderfully devoted love my life,\nwho just also happens to be the perfect cuddle buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, when you put in like that.\u201d </p><p>Namjoon rolled onto his side that you were facing each other,\nopening his arms, and you wasted no time in tucking yourself under his chin.\nHis hands gently stroked up and down your back. </p><p>\u201cThanks for coming with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine being anywhere else.\u201d</p><p>The warm air tangy with salt from the ocean breeze, the\nsounds of waves gently lapping against the shore- it didn\u2019t take long from your\nbreathing. Wrapped in the arms of the person who made you feel so loved and\nsafe. You don\u2019t remember the last time you felt this content, and you truly hoped\nNamjoon felt the same.</p><p><b>JIMIN</b><br></p><p>Success was a double-edged sword. At the same time that\nJimin and his brothers worked hard to achieve their dreams, reaching milestones\nand breaking records in the process, it also became harder and harder to just be\nthemselves. With success came recognition, and with recognition came the nearly\nimpossible task of going out in public with ease.</p><p>It was something that Jimin was used to by this point, but\nhe knew it was still hard for you. Your life had changed the moment you agreed\nto go out on a first date with him but you had no regrets. Even though the\nrelationship was still new, you couldn\u2019t imagine your life without Jimin in it.</p><p>Your birthday was coming up, and he wanted to do something\nspecial for you, something where you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about cameras or\nprying eyes. That\u2019s when he remembered the new hot springs resort with rave\nreviews; it was perfect for a weekend getaway. Jimin was nervous, this was a\nfirst in your relationship, but seeing your eyes light up as you approached the\nresort made all his worries melt away.</p><p>Later than evening, a blissful sigh escaped your lips as\nslid deeper into the steaming water. \u201cOh my god,\u201d you moaned. \u201cIs this what\nheaven feels like?\u201d</p><p>Beside you, Jimin hummed in agreement. Glancing over, your\nbreath caught in your throat. In the soft moonlight, your boyfriend looked\nabsolutely ethereal; eyes closed, head tilted back to rest against the edge of\nthe spring, he could be a nymph out of an old fairytale. Not for the first\ntime, you found yourself stunned with the knowledge that he was yours. </p><p>Jimin cracked an eye open when he heard you moving, water\nrippling with your movement as you came to straddle his hips. Hands\ninstinctively went to your waist as he lifted his head up, drinking in the\nsight of you.</p><p>Your hands gently carded through his hair, brushing the damp\nlocks back as you dipped down to kiss him, slow and sweet. You leaned your forehead\nagainst his. \u201cI love you,\u201d you whispered, lips ghosting over his.</p><p> \u201cI love you too, so\nmuch.\u201d He reached up, hands gentle as he cupped your face. \u201cI want this to last\nforever.\u201d </p><p>You barely had time to take another breath before Jimin\npulled you down into another kiss, this time full of desperation and need. You\nwere putty in his hands, melting under his every touch, burning up in your love\nfor him.</p><p>It was a night of firsts, the first of many, one to always\nbe remembered.</p><p><b>TAEHYUNG</b></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all for an excuse to buy something new but I think this\nis a bit much,\u201d you whined at your boyfriend\u2019s back. You sat haphazardly on the\nchic leather sofa in the middle of the designer boutique as he flitted around\nthe store, the star-struck and slightly panicked sales associate scrambling\naround behind him to keep up.</p><p>\u201cOh my beautiful darling, you know how important this,\u201d\nTaehyung answered over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThe clothes we have are more than fine. I mean, you picked\nmost of them out, for both of us,\u201d you laughed.</p><p>\u201cThis is different though.\u201d He pulled out a dress, holding\nup it for your inspection. You shrugged indifferently, and after a second look,\nhe handed to the nearest associate. \u201cNeed to see it on,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>In just over a week the two of you were travelling to Paris\nfor Fashion Week. You had thought your boyfriend was going to have a stroke\nwhen he learned the news from his manager. As someone who loved fashion as much\nas Taehyung did, it was like a dream come true. You couldn\u2019t remember the last\ntime you\u2019d seen him this excited yet anxious. You knew this was a big deal, for\nseveral different reasons, but you couldn\u2019t help but worry that he was going overboard.\n</p><p>With a sigh, you got up from the sofa, motioning for a\nmoment alone and smiling thankfully as the sales associate left, bowing to you\nas they took their armfuls of clothing to the dressing room. </p><p>You wrapped your arms around Taehyung\u2019s waist, resting you\ncheek on his back. \u201cYou\u2019ve already been invited, Tae,\u201d you told him. \u201cYou\u2019ve\nalready impressed whoever it is that decides who gets an invite and who doesn\u2019t.\nAll you need to do is show up and be your utterly amazing self. They won\u2019t know\nwhat hit them.\u201d</p><p>You heard him sigh before finally relaxing under your touch.\nYou loosened your arms as he turned, wrapping his own around your shoulders and\npulling you to his chest. </p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he answered, chin rested on top of your head. \u201cI\ndon\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know why I want their validation. It\u2019s just fashion. It\nsounds so stupid now that I say it out loud.\u201d</p><p>You leaned back, looking up into his face. \u201cHey. It\u2019s not\nstupid. It\u2019s human nature to seek validation. You\u2019ve worked hard to hone your\nfashion and craft your image, it\u2019s only natural to want that hard work to be recognized,\nespecially when it\u2019s by people you admire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. For understanding,\u201d he whispered, leaning down\nto kiss the tip of your nose.</p><p>And the next week, after you saw the photos and magazine\narticles featuring Taehyung, and even a few with yourself, you knew that the\nnewest additions to your already overflowing closet were completely worth it.</p><p>\u00a0<b>JUNGKOOK</b></p><p>Even though you knew it was a survival mechanism brought on\nby idol life, of snatching precious moments of rest whenever you could, one of\nthe many things you admired about Jungkook was his ability to fall asleep\nalmost anywhere, at any time.</p><p>Halfway through the long flight and you hadn\u2019t been able to\ndo more than edit some pictures and videos on your laptop.

What is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>With a raised eyebrow, you looked up at your boyfriend from\nwhere you were sat on the street curb. For the last ten minutes he had been\nmumbling to himself as he tried to figure out exactly where you were, and how\nto get back to where you were supposed to be. His phone dead, yours accidently\nleft at the hotel, and in a country that neither of you spoke the language, you\nwere essentially helpless.</p><p>Not that you minded being lost; going off the beaten was\nsometimes the best way to see a new place and you knew you\u2019d eventually find\nthe way back. But when you\u2019re supposed to be meeting the others for dinner and\nhad no way to contact them, well, that threw a wrench into the situation.</p><p>You huffed, finding it hard to be mad when he looked so\ncute. Finally you stood up, wiping the dirt off your pants and holding out your\nhand. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>Taking your hand without question, Jin allowed you to lead\nhim down the street. \u201cBut how do you know this is the right way?\u201d he pouted.</p><p>You smiled over your shoulder at him. \u201cI don\u2019t. But just\nsitting there isn\u2019t going to get us anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Hand in hand, you strolled down the cobbled streets, content\nin each other\u2019s company and enjoying the quiet buzz of the city.</p><p>As the shadows grew long along the streets, you finally reached\nthe seaside promenade, just as the sun was dipping below the horizon. You\ngasped in delight as the sky was set ablaze with fiery oranges and reds as the\nsun sunk melted into the dark ocean.</p><p>Strong arms circled your waist, and you leaned back into the\nembrace. Jin pressed a kiss into your before leaning his head against yours,\nsavoring the moment. </p><p>If every day ended like this, in a beautiful city with a\nbeautiful girl in his arms, he would get lost a thousand times over.</p><p>\u00a0<b>YOONGI</b></p><p>It was no secret that Yoongi\u2019s least favorite part of\ntravelling was having to go through the loud and sometimes pushy throng of fans\nwhen entering and leaving the airport. Some times were better than others, but\nevery time he would be on edge until it was over. But this time was different\nthan all the others, because for the first time you were travelling with the\nmembers as they set off on the next leg of their tour instead of meeting them in\nthe first city.</p><p>You relationship had been public for several months, but as\nyou both valued your privacy, you still kept your public appearances to a\nminimum. That meant that Yoongi didn\u2019t know how the fans would react, which made\nhim more nervous than usual. </p><p>As they prepared to exit the SUV that had brought them to\nthe airport, Yoongi looked over at you. \u201cNo matter what, just keep walking and never\nlet go of my hand, okay?\u201d</p><p>You nodded, leaning over to press a quick kiss to his lips. \u201cI\u2019ll\nnever let go, Jack.\u201d</p><p>You smiled in triumph as his shoulders dropped slightly,\nsome of the tension leaving his body at your corny line.</p><p>He nodded to Namjoon and Jungkook who were seated in the row\nahead of them that they were ready to go, and taking your hand, pulled you out\nof the car. </p><p>Your steps stuttered, momentarily stunned at the cacophony\nof noise and blinding flashes. You could see the company\u2019s security team on\neither side as you walked, but that didn\u2019t stop you from being jostled as some\nbrave fans tried to rush them in order to get closer to the members. But as\npromised, you held Yoongi\u2019s hand and followed his lead. </p><p>On the other side of airport security, you finally released\na breath you didn\u2019t realize you had been holding. Yoongi turned around, eyes\nscanned up and down your body. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He pulled you against his chest, holding you tight as he\npressed a kiss to your temple. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p><b>\u00a0</b><b>HOSEOK</b></p><p>It was no secret that Hoseok was the most fiercely protective\nmember of BTS. It didn\u2019t matter if you were his hyung or dongsaeng, if you were\nin need, he was there. It therefore was no surprise that that went tenfold for\nyou, his girlfriend. From the beginning, Hoseok had not wanted to hide your\nrelationship. As soon as knew that what you had together was more than a fling,\nhe went to management and informed them of his intentions of revealing that you\nwere dating. They wouldn\u2019t stop him but made sure that both he, and you,\nunderstood the potential consequences.</p><p>You were slowly becoming accustomed to near constant flash\nof lights and screams of fans anytime you stepped out in public with Hoseok. It\nwas jarring, and you don\u2019t know that you\u2019d ever be fully used to it, but you\nwere learning how to handle the attention.</p><p>Today was no different. You had flown out to be with the\ngroup for the last two cities on the European leg of the tour, and now you were\nall on the way back to Korea. After having been gone for the last three months,\nmanagement had told you to expect a big crowd at Incheon.</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s vicelike grip on your singular focus as he pulled\nyou behind him, your joined hands held at the small of his back. You were suddenly\nyanked backward, a shocked gasp escaping as you hit the ground. Fingernails dig\ninto your skin, sinking deep when you tried to yank your arm out of their\ngrasp.</p><p>\u201cLeave J-Hope. Leave him alone. He\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>You looked around, eyes filling with tears. \u201cPlease, let go.\nYou\u2019re hurting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave him. Do you hear me?\u201d You screamed as she yanked your\nhead, you neck painfully snapping back at the motion.</p><p>\u201cHands. Off,\u201d a deep voice growled from above you.</p><p>Even as the tears spilled, relief flooded your body at the\nsight of your boyfriend standing over you. </p><p>As the crazed fan reach for Hoseok, screaming his name,\nsecurity finally got to you, roughly pushing the girl away.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey,\u201d Hoseok said, his voice soft as he reached down,\ngently pulled you up and into his chest. \u201cI\u2019ve got you know. I\u2019m so sorry,\nbaby, so so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Tucking you his side and using his arm to cover your head, a\nsteely faced Hoseok led you the rest of the way out of the airport.</p><p>He pushed you up to the open door of the SUV, thankful to see\nYoongi\u2019s arm each out to help you into the car. He quickly followed you,\nwasting no time in taking you back into his arms.</p><p>\u201cHobi hyung, what happened back there?\u201d Jimin\u2019s quiet voice\nasked from the seats behind them, his hand reaching up to rest gently on the\ntop of your head.</p><p>\u201cSomeone from the crowd got throw security and knocked her\ndown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Y/N-noona,\u201d Taehyung whispered from beside Jimin.</p><p>Hoseok\u2019s heart clenched feeling you shake in his arms. He\ndon\u2019t know what went wrong but he vowed that nothing like that would ever\nhappen again, not as long he had something to say about it.</p><p><b>NAMJOON</b></p><p>Laying on your stomach, head resting on folded arms, you\nwatched with a fond smile as your overgrown kid of a boyfriend waded around in\nthe tidal pools closer to the water\u2019s edge. A weekend at the beach, a weekend\nto recharge and refill his creative well.</p><p>You weren\u2019t entirely sure how searching for crabs helped\nwith that, but you definitely weren\u2019t going to stop him. You were just thankful\nthat he was getting a break, knowing how much work he was putting into the\nlatest comeback. You rarely saw each other in daylight hours, often only\nexchanging a few words and tired kisses as one or the other of you slipped in\nor out of your shared bed. You weren\u2019t complaining, it came with the territory\nof being a relationship with an idol, but having him all to yourself for the\nnext 48 hours felt amazing.</p><p> \u201cJoon!\u201d you called. </p><p>You rolled over to your back, closing your eyes against the\nbright sun.</p><p>\u201cHey beautiful,\u201d Namjoon hummed as he crawled up your body.\nHolding himself up on his forearms, he dipped down, capturing your lips with\nhis own. \u201cYou lonely up here all by yourself?\u201d He nipped at your bottom lip, a\ncocky smirk playing against his own.</p><p>You playfully smacked his chest. \u201cOh my god that was so\ncringey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say, in that swimsuit you bring out the fuckboy\nin me.\u201d</p><p>Snaking your arms around his neck, you pulled him in for\nanother kiss. \u201cAlso cringey. But I\u2019m glad you like it. But right now I want you\nto take a nap with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAish, is that all I am to you, a glorified pillow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d you said, poking his cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re my\ninsanely talented, unbelievably attractive, wonderfully devoted love my life,\nwho just also happens to be the perfect cuddle buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, when you put in like that.\u201d </p><p>Namjoon rolled onto his side that you were facing each other,\nopening his arms, and you wasted no time in tucking yourself under his chin.\nHis hands gently stroked up and down your back. </p><p>\u201cThanks for coming with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine being anywhere else.\u201d</p><p>The warm air tangy with salt from the ocean breeze, the\nsounds of waves gently lapping against the shore- it didn\u2019t take long from your\nbreathing. Wrapped in the arms of the person who made you feel so loved and\nsafe. You don\u2019t remember the last time you felt this content, and you truly hoped\nNamjoon felt the same.</p><p><b>JIMIN</b><br></p><p>Success was a double-edged sword. At the same time that\nJimin and his brothers worked hard to achieve their dreams, reaching milestones\nand breaking records in the process, it also became harder and harder to just be\nthemselves. With success came recognition, and with recognition came the nearly\nimpossible task of going out in public with ease.</p><p>It was something that Jimin was used to by this point, but\nhe knew it was still hard for you. Your life had changed the moment you agreed\nto go out on a first date with him but you had no regrets. Even though the\nrelationship was still new, you couldn\u2019t imagine your life without Jimin in it.</p><p>Your birthday was coming up, and he wanted to do something\nspecial for you, something where you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about cameras or\nprying eyes. That\u2019s when he remembered the new hot springs resort with rave\nreviews; it was perfect for a weekend getaway. Jimin was nervous, this was a\nfirst in your relationship, but seeing your eyes light up as you approached the\nresort made all his worries melt away.</p><p>Later than evening, a blissful sigh escaped your lips as\nslid deeper into the steaming water. \u201cOh my god,\u201d you moaned. \u201cIs this what\nheaven feels like?\u201d</p><p>Beside you, Jimin hummed in agreement. Glancing over, your\nbreath caught in your throat. In the soft moonlight, your boyfriend looked\nabsolutely ethereal; eyes closed, head tilted back to rest against the edge of\nthe spring, he could be a nymph out of an old fairytale. Not for the first\ntime, you found yourself stunned with the knowledge that he was yours. </p><p>Jimin cracked an eye open when he heard you moving, water\nrippling with your movement as you came to straddle his hips. Hands\ninstinctively went to your waist as he lifted his head up, drinking in the\nsight of you.</p><p>Your hands gently carded through his hair, brushing the damp\nlocks back as you dipped down to kiss him, slow and sweet. You leaned your forehead\nagainst his. \u201cI love you,\u201d you whispered, lips ghosting over his.</p><p> \u201cI love you too, so\nmuch.\u201d He reached up, hands gentle as he cupped your face. \u201cI want this to last\nforever.\u201d </p><p>You barely had time to take another breath before Jimin\npulled you down into another kiss, this time full of desperation and need. You\nwere putty in his hands, melting under his every touch, burning up in your love\nfor him.</p><p>It was a night of firsts, the first of many, one to always\nbe remembered.</p><p><b>TAEHYUNG</b></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all for an excuse to buy something new but I think this\nis a bit much,\u201d you whined at your boyfriend\u2019s back. You sat haphazardly on the\nchic leather sofa in the middle of the designer boutique as he flitted around\nthe store, the star-struck and slightly panicked sales associate scrambling\naround behind him to keep up.</p><p>\u201cOh my beautiful darling, you know how important this,\u201d\nTaehyung answered over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThe clothes we have are more than fine. I mean, you picked\nmost of them out, for both of us,\u201d you laughed.</p><p>\u201cThis is different though.\u201d He pulled out a dress, holding\nup it for your inspection. You shrugged indifferently, and after a second look,\nhe handed to the nearest associate. \u201cNeed to see it on,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>In just over a week the two of you were travelling to Paris\nfor Fashion Week. You had thought your boyfriend was going to have a stroke\nwhen he learned the news from his manager. As someone who loved fashion as much\nas Taehyung did, it was like a dream come true. You couldn\u2019t remember the last\ntime you\u2019d seen him this excited yet anxious. You knew this was a big deal, for\nseveral different reasons, but you couldn\u2019t help but worry that he was going overboard.\n</p><p>With a sigh, you got up from the sofa, motioning for a\nmoment alone and smiling thankfully as the sales associate left, bowing to you\nas they took their armfuls of clothing to the dressing room. </p><p>You wrapped your arms around Taehyung\u2019s waist, resting you\ncheek on his back. \u201cYou\u2019ve already been invited, Tae,\u201d you told him. \u201cYou\u2019ve\nalready impressed whoever it is that decides who gets an invite and who doesn\u2019t.\nAll you need to do is show up and be your utterly amazing self. They won\u2019t know\nwhat hit them.\u201d</p><p>You heard him sigh before finally relaxing under your touch.\nYou loosened your arms as he turned, wrapping his own around your shoulders and\npulling you to his chest. </p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he answered, chin rested on top of your head. \u201cI\ndon\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know why I want their validation. It\u2019s just fashion. It\nsounds so stupid now that I say it out loud.\u201d</p><p>You leaned back, looking up into his face. \u201cHey. It\u2019s not\nstupid. It\u2019s human nature to seek validation. You\u2019ve worked hard to hone your\nfashion and craft your image, it\u2019s only natural to want that hard work to be recognized,\nespecially when it\u2019s by people you admire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. For understanding,\u201d he whispered, leaning down\nto kiss the tip of your nose.</p><p>And the next week, after you saw the photos and magazine\narticles featuring Taehyung, and even a few with yourself, you knew that the\nnewest additions to your already overflowing closet were completely worth it.</p><p>\u00a0<b>JUNGKOOK</b></p><p>Even though you knew it was a survival mechanism brought on\nby idol life, of snatching precious moments of rest whenever you could, one of\nthe many things you admired about Jungkook was his ability to fall asleep\nalmost anywhere, at any time.</p><p>Halfway through the long flight and you hadn\u2019t been able to\ndo more than edit some pictures and videos on your laptop. Meanwhile, sprawled\nout in the reclined seat next to yours, your boyfriend slept, dead to the\nworld. Even though you were slightly jealous, you couldn\u2019t help but smile\nfondly at the man beside you. In his sleep, Jungkook looked even more like a\nbaby boy, something you loved to tease him about. <b></b></p><p>With a sigh, you stretched your arms overhead, groaning with\nsatisfaction as the motion pulled at the tight muscles in your back. You stood,\nglancing at the seats behind you where the other members were sat. Taehyung,\nYoongi, and Jin were also asleep. Namjoon was writing in his notebook, head\nbobbing to whatever beat he was listening to through his headphones. Hoseok and\nJimin were each on their phones but looked up when they noticed you standing,\nsilent glances asking if everything was okay. You smiled at them, assuring them\nyou were fine, miming that you were getting a drink, asking if they wanted one.\n</p><p>Carefully stepping over Jungkook\u2019s legs, you made your way\ntoward the front of the plane, asking one of the flight attendants for a Coke.\nYou chatted with them while you sipped your drink, always find their travel\nstories fascinating. </p><p>As you made your way back to your seat, you saw something\nthat made you stop, your blood running cold- the unmistakable sight of a\ncellphone angled towards your sleeping boyfriend. Your first instinct was to\ngrab the cellphone and bang it over the head of however was violating Jungkook\u2019s\nprivacy. But your second instinct, the one you followed, had you striding forward,\nstopping in front the offending cellphone.</p><p>The owner looked up, eyes wide when she realized who you\nwere. You knew who, or rather what, she was. She tried to put the phone back in\nher bag but you reached out, clamping a hand around her wrist. You leaned forward,\nvoice low and menacing. \u201cI see this playing out one of two ways. One, you\nwilling give me your phone and don\u2019t make a fuss when security comes over. Or\ntwo, you willing give me your phone and don\u2019t make a fuss when security comes\nover.\u201d You watch as she shakily retrieves the phone and drops into your waiting\nhand. </p><p>Schooling your features to not worry the members who were\nawake, you find the head of security and inform him of what happened. Only once\nthey move into the next section do you breathe a sigh of relief and sink back\ninto your seat.</p><p>Jungkook stirred besides you. \u201cYou okay, babe?\u201d he asks, voice\nstill gravelling with sleep.</p><p>\u201cBetter now,\u201d you answer, reaching over to smooth back his\nhair, hand resting on his cheek. \u201cGo back to sleep, Kookie, we\u2019ve got a few\nmore hours before landing.\u201d</p><p>He nods sleepily, taking your hand and pressing a kiss to\nthe back of it before almost immediately falling back to sleep.</p><p>You know he would find out soon enough, but for now, you\nwere happy to let him sleep in peace.</p>",

You weren&rsquo;t complaining, it came with the territory\nof being a relationship with an idol, but having him all to yourself for the\nnext 48 hours felt amazing.</p><p> &ldquo;Joon!&rdquo; you called. </p><p>You rolled over to your back, closing your eyes against the\nbright sun.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey beautiful,&rdquo; Namjoon hummed as he crawled up your body.\nHolding himself up on his forearms, he dipped down, capturing your lips with\nhis own. &ldquo;You lonely up here all by yourself?&rdquo; He nipped at your bottom lip, a\ncocky smirk playing against his own.</p><p>You playfully smacked his chest. &ldquo;Oh my god that was so\ncringey.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What can I say, in that swimsuit you bring out the fuckboy\nin me.&rdquo;</p><p>Snaking your arms around his neck, you pulled him in for\nanother kiss. &ldquo;Also cringey. But I&rsquo;m glad you like it. But right now I want you\nto take a nap with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aish, is that all I am to you, a glorified pillow?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; you said, poking his cheek. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my\ninsanely talented, unbelievably attractive, wonderfully devoted love my life,\nwho just also happens to be the perfect cuddle buddy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, when you put in like that.&rdquo; </p><p>Namjoon rolled onto his side that you were facing each other,\nopening his arms, and you wasted no time in tucking yourself under his chin.\nHis hands gently stroked up and down your back. </p><p>&ldquo;Thanks for coming with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t imagine being anywhere else.&rdquo;</p><p>The warm air tangy with salt from the ocean breeze, the\nsounds of waves gently lapping against the shore- it didn&rsquo;t take long from your\nbreathing. Wrapped in the arms of the person who made you feel so loved and\nsafe. You don&rsquo;t remember the last time you felt this content, and you truly hoped\nNamjoon felt the same.</p><p><b>JIMIN</b><br /></p><p>Success was a double-edged sword. At the same time that\nJimin and his brothers worked hard to achieve their dreams, reaching milestones\nand breaking records in the process, it also became harder and harder to just be\nthemselves. With success came recognition, and with recognition came the nearly\nimpossible task of going out in public with ease.</p><p>It was something that Jimin was used to by this point, but\nhe knew it was still hard for you. Your life had changed the moment you agreed\nto go out on a first date with him but you had no regrets. Even though the\nrelationship was still new, you couldn&rsquo;t imagine your life without Jimin in it.</p><p>Your birthday was coming up, and he wanted to do something\nspecial for you, something where you wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about cameras or\nprying eyes. That&rsquo;s when he remembered the new hot springs resort with rave\nreviews; it was perfect for a weekend getaway. Jimin was nervous, this was a\nfirst in your relationship, but seeing your eyes light up as you approached the\nresort made all his worries melt away.</p><p>Later than evening, a blissful sigh escaped your lips as\nslid deeper into the steaming water. &ldquo;Oh my god,&rdquo; you moaned. &ldquo;Is this what\nheaven feels like?&rdquo;</p><p>Beside you, Jimin hummed in agreement. Glancing over, your\nbreath caught in your throat. In the soft moonlight, your boyfriend looked\nabsolutely ethereal; eyes closed, head tilted back to rest against the edge of\nthe spring, he could be a nymph out of an old fairytale. Not for the first\ntime, you found yourself stunned with the knowledge that he was yours. </p><p>Jimin cracked an eye open when he heard you moving, water\nrippling with your movement as you came to straddle his hips. Hands\ninstinctively went to your waist as he lifted his head up, drinking in the\nsight of you.</p><p>Your hands gently carded through his hair, brushing the damp\nlocks back as you dipped down to kiss him, slow and sweet. You leaned your forehead\nagainst his. &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; you whispered, lips ghosting over his.</p><p> &ldquo;I love you too, so\nmuch.&rdquo; He reached up, hands gentle as he cupped your face. &ldquo;I want this to last\nforever.&rdquo; </p><p>You barely had time to take another breath before Jimin\npulled you down into another kiss, this time full of desperation and need. You\nwere putty in his hands, melting under his every touch, burning up in your love\nfor him.</p><p>It was a night of firsts, the first of many, one to always\nbe remembered.</p><p><b>TAEHYUNG</b></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all for an excuse to buy something new but I think this\nis a bit much,&rdquo; you whined at your boyfriend&rsquo;s back. You sat haphazardly on the\nchic leather sofa in the middle of the designer boutique as he flitted around\nthe store, the star-struck and slightly panicked sales associate scrambling\naround behind him to keep up.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my beautiful darling, you know how important this,&rdquo;\nTaehyung answered over his shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;The clothes we have are more than fine. I mean, you picked\nmost of them out, for both of us,&rdquo; you laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;This is different though.&rdquo; He pulled out a dress, holding\nup it for your inspection. You shrugged indifferently, and after a second look,\nhe handed to the nearest associate. &ldquo;Need to see it on,&rdquo; he muttered.</p><p>In just over a week the two of you were travelling to Paris\nfor Fashion Week. You had thought your boyfriend was going to have a stroke\nwhen he learned the news from his manager. As someone who loved fashion as much\nas Taehyung did, it was like a dream come true. You couldn&rsquo;t remember the last\ntime you&rsquo;d seen him this excited yet anxious. You knew this was a big deal, for\nseveral different reasons, but you couldn&rsquo;t help but worry that he was going overboard.\n</p><p>With a sigh, you got up from the sofa, motioning for a\nmoment alone and smiling thankfully as the sales associate left, bowing to you\nas they took their armfuls of clothing to the dressing room. </p><p>You wrapped your arms around Taehyung&rsquo;s waist, resting you\ncheek on his back. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve already been invited, Tae,&rdquo; you told him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve\nalready impressed whoever it is that decides who gets an invite and who doesn&rsquo;t.\nAll you need to do is show up and be your utterly amazing self. They won&rsquo;t know\nwhat hit them.&rdquo;</p><p>You heard him sigh before finally relaxing under your touch.\nYou loosened your arms as he turned, wrapping his own around your shoulders and\npulling you to his chest. </p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he answered, chin rested on top of your head. &ldquo;I\ndon&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know why I want their validation. It&rsquo;s just fashion. It\nsounds so stupid now that I say it out loud.&rdquo;</p><p>You leaned back, looking up into his face. &ldquo;Hey. It&rsquo;s not\nstupid. It&rsquo;s human nature to seek validation. You&rsquo;ve worked hard to hone your\nfashion and craft your image, it&rsquo;s only natural to want that hard work to be recognized,\nespecially when it&rsquo;s by people you admire.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you. For understanding,&rdquo; he whispered, leaning down\nto kiss the tip of your nose.</p><p>And the next week, after you saw the photos and magazine\narticles featuring Taehyung, and even a few with yourself, you knew that the\nnewest additions to your already overflowing closet were completely worth it.</p><p>&nbsp;<b>JUNGKOOK</b></p><p>Even though you knew it was a survival mechanism brought on\nby idol life, of snatching precious moments of rest whenever you could, one of\nthe many things you admired about Jungkook was his ability to fall asleep\nalmost anywhere, at any time.</p><p>Halfway through the long flight and you hadn&rsquo;t been able to\ndo more than edit some pictures and videos on your laptop. Meanwhile, sprawled\nout in the reclined seat next to yours, your boyfriend slept, dead to the\nworld. Even though you were slightly jealous, you couldn&rsquo;t help but smile\nfondly at the man beside you. In his sleep, Jungkook looked even more like a\nbaby boy, something you loved to tease him about. <b></b></p><p>With a sigh, you stretched your arms overhead, groaning with\nsatisfaction as the motion pulled at the tight muscles in your back. You stood,\nglancing at the seats behind you where the other members were sat. Taehyung,\nYoongi, and Jin were also asleep. Namjoon was writing in his notebook, head\nbobbing to whatever beat he was listening to through his headphones. Hoseok and\nJimin were each on their phones but looked up when they noticed you standing,\nsilent glances asking if everything was okay. You smiled at them, assuring them\nyou were fine, miming that you were getting a drink, asking if they wanted one.\n</p><p>Carefully stepping over Jungkook&rsquo;s legs, you made your way\ntoward the front of the plane, asking one of the flight attendants for a Coke.\nYou chatted with them while you sipped your drink, always find their travel\nstories fascinating. </p><p>As you made your way back to your seat, you saw something\nthat made you stop, your blood running cold- the unmistakable sight of a\ncellphone angled towards your sleeping boyfriend. Your first instinct was to\ngrab the cellphone and bang it over the head of however was violating Jungkook&rsquo;s\nprivacy. But your second instinct, the one you followed, had you striding forward,\nstopping in front the offending cellphone.</p><p>The owner looked up, eyes wide when she realized who you\nwere. You knew who, or rather what, she was. She tried to put the phone back in\nher bag but you reached out, clamping a hand around her wrist. You leaned forward,\nvoice low and menacing. &ldquo;I see this playing out one of two ways. One, you\nwilling give me your phone and don&rsquo;t make a fuss when security comes over. Or\ntwo, you willing give me your phone and don&rsquo;t make a fuss when security comes\nover.&rdquo; You watch as she shakily retrieves the phone and drops into your waiting\nhand. </p><p>Schooling your features to not worry the members who were\nawake, you find the head of security and inform him of what happened. Only once\nthey move into the next section do you breathe a sigh of relief and sink back\ninto your seat.</p><p>Jungkook stirred besides you. &ldquo;You okay, babe?&rdquo; he asks, voice\nstill gravelling with sleep.</p><p>&ldquo;Better now,&rdquo; you answer, reaching over to smooth back his\nhair, hand resting on his cheek. &ldquo;Go back to sleep, Kookie, we&rsquo;ve got a few\nmore hours before landing.&rdquo;</p><p>He nods sleepily, taking your hand and pressing a kiss to\nthe back of it before almost immediately falling back to sleep.</p><p>You know he would find out soon enough, but for now, you\nwere happy to let him sleep in peace.</p>",

Il ristorante parla da s\u00e9 dal momento che ovunque ci si giri ci sono poster e adesivi.</p><p>Siamo stati abbastanza fortunati da riuscire a parlare con Kang, che \u00e8 una delle poche persone ad essere stata a pi\u00f9 stretto contatto con i BTS nei primi tempi della loro carriera.</p><p>Questo \u00e8 quello che ci ha rivelato sui ragazzi.</p><p><b><i>-DOMANDA- Abbiamo sentito dire che i membri dei BTS venivano in questo ristorante tutti i giorni quando erano trainee.

Ogni volta che ci incontravamo mi salutavano e io avevo l\u2019impressione ci fosse qualcosa di diverso in loro.</p><p>Il successo che stanno avendo non \u00e8 dato semplicemente dalla fortuna ma \u00e8 frutto del loro sforzo. Hanno davvero versato sangue e sudore nel loro lavoro. A volte pensavo che se i loro genitori li avessero visti [in quello stato], si sarebbero sentiti male per loro. Quando terminavano il loro duro allenamento salivano dallo studio nel seminterrato con magliette e capelli grondanti dal sudore\u201d.</p><p>Loro si allenavano ogni giorno dalla mattina alle dieci di sera. Alcune volte continuavano per tutta la notte. Hanno lavorato cos\u00ec duramente.<br/></p><p>Penso che ora che hanno raggiunto l\u2019apice i membri dei BTS guardino al loro passato. \u00c8 raro per delle persone della loro et\u00e0 lavorare cos\u00ec duramente. Molti vogliono giocare, uscire con gli amici. Sa, non \u00e8 cos\u00ec facile lasciare tutto e focalizzarsi su una cosa sola. E ci\u00f2 che i sacrifici hanno portato loro \u00e8 100 volte meglio.\u201d</p><p><b><i>-DOMANDA- Se venivano qui ogni giorno il cibo deve essere buono. Mangiavano spesso gli stessi piatti?</i></b></p><p><b>KANG:</b> \u201cS\u00ec, mangiavano spesso le stesse cose. Alternavano tra un piatto e l\u2019altro. Preferivano il bibimbap fatto con riso e maiale. Quello poi \u00e8 diventato il \u201cBibimbap dei Bangtan\u201d. Per circa due anni e mezzo sono venuti qui a mangiare. All'inizio mangiavano due o tre ciotole di riso prima che la loro compagnia li mettesse a dieta. Yoongi \n\n(<i>Suga</i>)\n\nera solito mangiare petto di pollo, latte e banana tutto frullato insieme.</p><p>A volte gli facevo mangiare i loro cibi preferiti di nascosto e mi ricordo che dicevo loro che dovevano mangiare bene per lavorare a modo. E che non avrebbero preso peso perch\u00e9 si muovevano tanto.\u201d</p><p><b><i>-DOMANDA- Chi aveva pi\u00f9 fascino?</i></b></p><p><b>KANG:</b> \u201cNonostante tutti avessero il loro fascino, direi Jimin.\u201d</p><p><b><i>-DOMANDA- Le hanno mai chiesto consigli?</i></b></p><p><b>KANG:</b> \u201cA volte parlavano. Sono sicura abbiano avuto la loro dose di difficolt\u00e0 ma sono sempre riusciti a parlarne tra di loro senza litigare. Namjoon (<i>RM</i>) non metteva mai gi\u00f9 il telefono mentre mangiava per migliorarsi studiando gli altri performer e tra me e me pensavo che lui avesse il potenziale per essere un leader, cosa che \u00e8 diventata poi realt\u00e0.</p><p>Yoongi\u00a0era davvero gentile. Si sono adattati tutti ai loro ruoli. Quando dopo un concerto li vedo mentre si abbracciano sul palco con le lacrime agli occhi, mi ritorna in mente quando facevano la stessa cosa da trainee, quando si abbracciavano e si prendevano cura l\u2019uno dell\u2019altro. \u00c8 davvero toccante.\u201d<br/></p><p><b><i>-DOMANDA- Si tiene ancora aggiornata sui BTS?</i></b></p><p><b>KANG:</b> \u201cLo faccio. Gli ARMY mi mandano cose, specialmente quando il gruppo tiene un concerto. Gli ARMY sono brave persone. Penso che proprio come i BTS, anche i loro fan siano gentili. Dai ventenni agli ottantenni, le persone di tutte le et\u00e0 mi dicono di ricavare energia dalla musica dei BTS. Parlo spesso con le persone che vengono al ristorante.</p><p>Alcuni fan stavano avendo problemi con il loro matrimonio. Mi hanno detto che i testi delle canzoni dei BTS continuavano a toccare loro il cuore sempre pi\u00f9 in profondit\u00e0, il che li ha aiutati a realizzare che c\u2019era qualcosa di sbagliato [nelle loro vite]. E da allora alcuni di loro mi hanno detto di essere stati capaci di ricominciare nuovamente e dare il via ad una nuova vita.</p><p>Quando lasci il lavoro, a volte ti senti davvero gi\u00f9 di morale. E alcune persone hanno cominciato a vivere una vita nuova grazie ai BTS. Trovo davvero interessante come cos\u00ec tanti fan, ognuno con la propria storia, siano riusciti ad essere motivati dalla musica dei BTS e a ricominciare di nuovo.\u201d</p><p><i><b>-DOMANDA- Ascolta i BTS?</b></i><br/><br/><b>KANG:</b> Quella che amo di pi\u00f9 tra tutte \u00e8 \u201cBlood Sweat &amp; Tears\u201d. Il testo mi tocca il cuore e sono sicura che valga lo stesso per loro. Quando il negozio \u00e8 tranquillo, mi sembra quasi come se in qualsiasi momento potessero aprire la porta entrando e urlando \u201cImo (<i>N/B: lett. \u201czia\u201d</i>), abbiamo fame!\u201d.</p><p>Nel giorno del debutto vennero qui a mangiare e a fare foto, come hanno riportato i media. Sono felice che il nostro ristorante sia diventato famoso grazie a loro. Io sono solo una ristoratrice, non so se l'abbiano fatto per gratitudine o meno, ma devono aver parlato del locale alla gente, visto che moltissimi clienti sono Army e tanti altri [lo diventano] dopo aver mangiato \u201d.<br/></p><p><i><b>-DOMANDA- Quand'\u00e8\u00a0stata l\u2019ultima volta che li ha visti?</b></i></p><p><b>KANG:</b> \u201cNon li vedo dal luglio di due anni fa (<i>2017</i>), circa, quando Seokjin venne da solo. Mi mancano. Avranno sempre un posto speciale nel mio cuore. Mi chiedo come stiano, se mangino bene quando sono all'estero. Vorrei che tornassero a farmi visita, davvero, quando vogliono. Mi mancano moltissimo e mi piacerebbe fare qualcosa per loro.</p><p>Non dicevo mai di volere loro bene, piuttosto di rimanere in salute e mangiare bene. Se li vedessi ora invece direi che voglio loro bene. Mi ricordo che Yoongi mi disse che quando si sarebbero spostati con gli uffici dell\u2019agenzia, i fan allora sarebbero venuti al ristorante. Io penso piacerebbe loro tornare qui, ma non deve essere facile. \u00a0</p><p>Sa, io non ho fatto molto. Sono solo una ristoratrice che ha cercato di cucinare il meglio possibile per dei ragazzi che vivevano lontano dai loro genitori. Parlando da madre, mi sono comportata con loro quasi come un genitore. </p><p>Sono solo felice che non si siano dimenticati di me\u201d. \u00a0</p><p><b><i>Traduzione a cura di Bangtan Italian Channel Subs (\u00a9Cam, \u00a9CiHope, \u00a9lynch, \u00a9jimindipityR) | \u00a9KpopHerald</i></b></p>",
