Those who justify Dany\u2019s stance on blaming Jon about his parentage want him\u00a0to stay with Dany, not as a Targaryen, but in fact, a servant. And worse, they want him to be loyal to her and her only, and separate him from those who truly love him (the Starklings, Ghost, Sam, Tormund,&hellip;). That means he would belong to nowhere, neither Targs nor Starks, nor wildings. They are exactly the same as Dany. She does not accept Jon as a Targ, as her family, but her subject. She still wants him to stay with her, be her servant and her (I\u2019m sorry for saying this) s*xtoy.</p><p>While Dany rejects Jon\u2019s Targaryen lineage&hellip;</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"245\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c18f3e31cb4dcd20aa3c063261b11e94/tumblr_pr327qoQPL1s95j2so2_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"245\"/></figure><p>Gif: \u00a0<a href=\"http://gameofthronesdaily.tumblr.com/post/184688775960\">gameofthronesdaily</a><br/></p><p>See how these people treat Jon&hellip;</p><p>Sansa takes care of him, she acknowledges him as a Stark, as Ned\u2019s son at every turn.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"260\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e0ac67a3f912da463191c22a87359cf/tumblr_inline_oxo64jXZUu1v4fp6z_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"260\"/></figure><p>She supports him to be King in the North.

I dont care whether I like it or not because I mind my own damn business and leave you alone.\nI'm open minded to multiple ships in one fandom because why the fuck not? That doesn't mean I don't have an OTP I'm just chill.\nXemnas/Sora shipper since KH2 came out.\nI write.\nI make videos sometimes.\nI post my friend's art for her since she doesn't have a tumblr.\nI reblog whatever is my fancy. I also get random mood changes and spam random things straight. Oops. \nI will most likely post something REALLY clever every so often.",
