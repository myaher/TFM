        "body": "<p><b><br/></b>Although it was small in comparison to other national phenomenons, the sudden pattern in the cornfield brought hundreds of spectators to the farm to overlook the crop circles. Phil didn\u2019t mind too much, after a while the company of just his animals wasn\u2019t enough to ease his instinctual needs.<b><br/></b></p><p>Before the abnormalities began, it was only him and his livestock, no one else in their little cluster. Everyday he would ride behind the cattle on his quarter horse mare, herding them over the town bridge &ndash; which had a great view of the entirety of his farm &ndash; to the best grasslands. But just last week, on the daily ride home, he could have sworn he saw a silver dome shape gleaming in the light of the sunset, coming from just over the first hill, a small ways beyond the barn. He shook his head and chalked it up to a long day of work, assuring himself that he\u2019d finish the rest of the chores quickly so he could go to sleep early tonight. He put the cows back, remembering to say goodnight to all ten, and went to give Amber her grain, planning to check out the mirage his tired brain conjured up when she\u2019d settled. </p><p>Phil did up the latch on the barn door and started the walk out back. It was a bit of a journey, but he wouldn\u2019t risk riding out there in case Amber got spooked. He certainly didn\u2019t need a broken neck from being thrown. Coming over the crest of the hill, Phil thought he saw a figure dash through an opening in the crops to the left of his peripheral. </p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d He shouted, cursing himself for not bringing some form of defense. It was probably just some ratty criminal on the run, hiding out in his fields from the law. \u201cI said: who\u2019s there?\u201d Phil called again. He needed to get a good look at their face in case he had to go in to pick them out of a lineup after they were detained. Phil waited for a moment without seeing anything before he turned around to head home, deciding the criminal ran off again. He spun on his heel, jumping three feet in the air as he almost walked right into a man who looked to be just a bit younger than Phil. In the lingering sunlight, Phil found the man had curly brown hair, and gleaming brown eyes that stared right back at him &ndash; not in a creepy way, but with great interest and curiosity. After a few stuttering breaths, Phil calmed down, putting his hand over his heart to assess its pounding rhythm. </p><p>\u201cUh, hi,\u201d he choked out, the man simply staring back at him in silence. As Phil awkwardly studied him in return, he was convinced he saw the man\u2019s brown eyes changing color. They turned from golden brown to a blue gray, then a muted purple &ndash; like the aurora borealis &ndash; \u00a0finally settling on brown once more. Phil\u2019s brain assured himself that it wasn\u2019t possible for eyes to naturally be that color. Time passed, and the man kept staring at Phil, seemingly unblinking. Phil was silently freaking out. He assumed they must be in between a language barrier or else the man surely would have said something by now, so he motioned to himself slowly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Phil,\u201d he enunciated, speaking slowly and trying for a warm tone. He wasn\u2019t sure if the man would respond, so he held his hand out as a peace offering. Phil watched as the man&rsquo;s eyes darted from Phil\u2019s hand to his face and back, panicky, but almost as if they were also searching for something. Phil shrugged and withdrew his hand to rest at his side. He took one final look into the field for any source of explanation as to where the trespasser came from. </p><p>\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d He grumbled, withdrawing from the encounter to walk back to his house, hoping the man would run off to wherever he came from and leave him be. The guy really didn\u2019t look like a psychopath. Not that one could necessarily model the part on appearance alone, but that\u2019s beside the point. Phil made it to the backdoor a while later. He hadn\u2019t heard anything else on the way back, so he figured he was in the clear from any more potential disturbances. In the reflection of the door\u2019s window, he almost imagined another figure behind him. He turned around cautiously, and sure enough, the weird guy was there. Except now, his hair looked darker under the light of the back porch, and his skin was glowing. And not like a happy glow. Purple, like his eyes had once been. </p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d Phil stuttered as he was watched expectantly. \u201cDo you want to come in?\u201d He offered, mentally punching himself. This guy was Cirque-Du-Soleil levels of freaky and Phil just asked him to enter his home. What\u2019s next, tea and family game night? Although he had another puzzled look about him, the man (thing?) gave a jerky head nod and watched Phil again. Phil opened the screen door, waiting for man to go in. When he didn\u2019t enter first, Phill sighed and went in, clumsily holding the door as the man right on his heels. Literally. He had almost no elbow room. This was by far the weirdest and most awkward Phil had ever felt. Closing the door behind them, he attempted to turn around, coming to a stop a mere few inches from the other man\u2019s face. And even though he should probably pull back and apologize, he was convinced that the man\u2019s eyes were changing color &ndash; blue to gray, then purple, with a hint of yellow. Phil was frozen still and studying the man once more, but he jerked back a step when his brain caught up to the anomaly in front of him. </p><p>\u201cDo you have a name?\u201d He asked, even somewhat knowing that he wouldn\u2019t get an answer. The man surprised him once more, though, as he opened his mouth to speak. </p><p>What came out was more of a garbled squawk, though. Phil had to hold back a laugh, knowing it would be rude to make fun of his guest. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we speak the same language,\u201d he began, \u201cbut I caught a bit of a \u2018D\u2019 sound in there so we\u2019ll go off that. How about -\u201d he broke off, looking around his kitchen for something. He spotted an empty can on the counter. \u201cDan?\u201d The man preened at that, a bright pink hue working its way up his freckled neck. There was a softness in his eyes, too. Phil couldn\u2019t stop looking at them, the color changes reminding him of paint washing off a brush, all the shades mixing and bleeding together. Besides his eyes and gleaming skin, Phil noticed Dan was wearing normal clothes, like his &ndash; baggy jeans and a loose cotton tee, but no shoes. His feet were awfully clean for being barefoot in the dirt for however long he must have been wandering around in Phil\u2019s fields. Phil really needed to figure out what was going on. He tried to gesture for Dan to go sit on the couch in the living room, deciding to show him what he meant instead when Dan didn\u2019t move from beside him. Immediately after Phil sat, Dan was next to him again, pressed right up against his side. Desperately, Phil tried to think of what to say, the silence gradually suffocating his brain. </p><p>Before Phil could speak, Dan pulled at his hand from where it rested on his knee. Phil let him, merely a spectator as Dan too his hand and turned it palm up. He kept his own eyes trained on Phil, assessing him for something, but Phil was too distracted to find out what. Dan\u2019s hand was unusually soft, almost silk-like, and as he looked on longer, the skin on his fingertips began to shift into the color of the night sky. Now Phil knew he was losing his mind, no doubt about it. Phil observed as the colors took over Dan\u2019s whole hand, resembling the galaxy enough that Phil could make out little planets and comets. It was astonishing. The galaxy kept growing bigger, traversing up Dan\u2019s arm, and even starting to appear on the other. Phil sensed himself smiling in awe, his unoccupied hand almost reaching out to touch Dan\u2019s, but stopping just before, fearful that he might muck up something so beautiful. </p><p>Sooner than he\u2019d like, the galaxies started to fade back down Dan\u2019s arm and onto his hand, finally ending to rest on his fingertips like polish. Dan smiled oddly at Phil. Phil shook his head, blown away but whatever it was that just happened. He\u2019d never seen anything like Dan, and now, selfishly, he wanted to keep him here and solve the puzzle of this wonderfully alien mystery.</p>",

He spun on his heel, jumping three feet in the air as he almost walked right into a man who looked to be just a bit younger than Phil. In the lingering sunlight, Phil found the man had curly brown hair, and gleaming brown eyes that stared right back at him \u2013 not in a creepy way, but with great interest and curiosity. After a few stuttering breaths, Phil calmed down, putting his hand over his heart to assess its pounding rhythm. </p><p>\u201cUh, hi,\u201d he choked out, the man simply staring back at him in silence. As Phil awkwardly studied him in return, he was convinced he saw the man\u2019s brown eyes changing color. They turned from golden brown to a blue gray, then a muted purple \u2013 like the aurora borealis \u2013 \u00a0finally settling on brown once more. Phil\u2019s brain assured himself that it wasn\u2019t possible for eyes to naturally be that color. Time passed, and the man kept staring at Phil, seemingly unblinking. Phil was silently freaking out. He assumed they must be in between a language barrier or else the man surely would have said something by now, so he motioned to himself slowly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Phil,\u201d he enunciated, speaking slowly and trying for a warm tone. He wasn\u2019t sure if the man would respond, so he held his hand out as a peace offering. Phil watched as the man\u2019s eyes darted from Phil\u2019s hand to his face and back, panicky, but almost as if they were also searching for something. Phil shrugged and withdrew his hand to rest at his side. He took one final look into the field for any source of explanation as to where the trespasser came from. </p><p>\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d He grumbled, withdrawing from the encounter to walk back to his house, hoping the man would run off to wherever he came from and leave him be. The guy really didn\u2019t look like a psychopath. Not that one could necessarily model the part on appearance alone, but that\u2019s beside the point. Phil made it to the backdoor a while later. He hadn\u2019t heard anything else on the way back, so he figured he was in the clear from any more potential disturbances. In the reflection of the door\u2019s window, he almost imagined another figure behind him. He turned around cautiously, and sure enough, the weird guy was there. Except now, his hair looked darker under the light of the back porch, and his skin was glowing. And not like a happy glow. Purple, like his eyes had once been. </p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d Phil stuttered as he was watched expectantly. \u201cDo you want to come in?\u201d He offered, mentally punching himself. This guy was Cirque-Du-Soleil levels of freaky and Phil just asked him to enter his home. What\u2019s next, tea and family game night? Although he had another puzzled look about him, the man (thing?) gave a jerky head nod and watched Phil again. Phil opened the screen door, waiting for man to go in. When he didn\u2019t enter first, Phill sighed and went in, clumsily holding the door as the man right on his heels. Literally. He had almost no elbow room. This was by far the weirdest and most awkward Phil had ever felt. Closing the door behind them, he attempted to turn around, coming to a stop a mere few inches from the other man\u2019s face. And even though he should probably pull back and apologize, he was convinced that the man\u2019s eyes were changing color \u2013 blue to gray, then purple, with a hint of yellow. Phil was frozen still and studying the man once more, but he jerked back a step when his brain caught up to the anomaly in front of him. </p><p>\u201cDo you have a name?\u201d He asked, even somewhat knowing that he wouldn\u2019t get an answer. The man surprised him once more, though, as he opened his mouth to speak. </p><p>What came out was more of a garbled squawk, though. Phil had to hold back a laugh, knowing it would be rude to make fun of his guest. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we speak the same language,\u201d he began, \u201cbut I caught a bit of a \u2018D\u2019 sound in there so we\u2019ll go off that. How about -\u201d he broke off, looking around his kitchen for something. He spotted an empty can on the counter. \u201cDan?\u201d The man preened at that, a bright pink hue working its way up his freckled neck. There was a softness in his eyes, too. Phil couldn\u2019t stop looking at them, the color changes reminding him of paint washing off a brush, all the shades mixing and bleeding together. Besides his eyes and gleaming skin, Phil noticed Dan was wearing normal clothes, like his \u2013 baggy jeans and a loose cotton tee, but no shoes. His feet were awfully clean for being barefoot in the dirt for however long he must have been wandering around in Phil\u2019s fields. Phil really needed to figure out what was going on. He tried to gesture for Dan to go sit on the couch in the living room, deciding to show him what he meant instead when Dan didn\u2019t move from beside him. Immediately after Phil sat, Dan was next to him again, pressed right up against his side. Desperately, Phil tried to think of what to say, the silence gradually suffocating his brain. </p><p>Before Phil could speak, Dan pulled at his hand from where it rested on his knee. Phil let him, merely a spectator as Dan too his hand and turned it palm up. He kept his own eyes trained on Phil, assessing him for something, but Phil was too distracted to find out what. Dan\u2019s hand was unusually soft, almost silk-like, and as he looked on longer, the skin on his fingertips began to shift into the color of the night sky. Now Phil knew he was losing his mind, no doubt about it. Phil observed as the colors took over Dan\u2019s whole hand, resembling the galaxy enough that Phil could make out little planets and comets. It was astonishing. The galaxy kept growing bigger, traversing up Dan\u2019s arm, and even starting to appear on the other. Phil sensed himself smiling in awe, his unoccupied hand almost reaching out to touch Dan\u2019s, but stopping just before, fearful that he might muck up something so beautiful. </p><p>Sooner than he\u2019d like, the galaxies started to fade back down Dan\u2019s arm and onto his hand, finally ending to rest on his fingertips like polish. Dan smiled oddly at Phil. Phil shook his head, blown away but whatever it was that just happened. He\u2019d never seen anything like Dan, and now, selfishly, he wanted to keep him here and solve the puzzle of this wonderfully alien mystery.</p>",
                "content": "<p><b><br /></b>Although it was small in comparison to other national phenomenons, the sudden pattern in the cornfield brought hundreds of spectators to the farm to overlook the crop circles. Phil didn&rsquo;t mind too much, after a while the company of just his animals wasn&rsquo;t enough to ease his instinctual needs.<b><br /></b></p><p>Before the abnormalities began, it was only him and his livestock, no one else in their little cluster. Everyday he would ride behind the cattle on his quarter horse mare, herding them over the town bridge &ndash; which had a great view of the entirety of his farm &ndash; to the best grasslands. But just last week, on the daily ride home, he could have sworn he saw a silver dome shape gleaming in the light of the sunset, coming from just over the first hill, a small ways beyond the barn. He shook his head and chalked it up to a long day of work, assuring himself that he&rsquo;d finish the rest of the chores quickly so he could go to sleep early tonight. He put the cows back, remembering to say goodnight to all ten, and went to give Amber her grain, planning to check out the mirage his tired brain conjured up when she&rsquo;d settled. </p><p>Phil did up the latch on the barn door and started the walk out back. It was a bit of a journey, but he wouldn&rsquo;t risk riding out there in case Amber got spooked. He certainly didn&rsquo;t need a broken neck from being thrown. Coming over the crest of the hill, Phil thought he saw a figure dash through an opening in the crops to the left of his peripheral. </p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; He shouted, cursing himself for not bringing some form of defense. It was probably just some ratty criminal on the run, hiding out in his fields from the law. &ldquo;I said: who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; Phil called again. He needed to get a good look at their face in case he had to go in to pick them out of a lineup after they were detained.
