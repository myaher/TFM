Since leaving the car on the side of the road in the middle of Oklahoma, it had been just Taehyung and yourself, walking the open road, deprived of water and a place to sleep. It was impossible to tell where you were now, walking like biters yourselves, staggering across the dusty roads.</p><p>Waking to the sound of refreshing birdsong, you squinted in the tawny sunlight. Rolling your head to your shoulder, your gaze landed on Taehyung crouched before you, the back of his hand pressed against your forehead worriedly, a frown etched to his lips. </p><p>You yawned, and he moved away his hand. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a fever.\u201d</p><p>A shaky laugh left your lips. \u201cAin\u2019t that funny.\u201d</p><p>His boots shifted on the gravel of the floor inside the multi storey car-park, your back leaned against the graffiti covered wall. A halo above your head in yellow spray-paint, Taehyung figured you looked pretty despite looking as you\u2019d expect in an apocalypse. Though, he didn\u2019t bet that he looked any better. </p><p>\u201cTired?\u201d he asked, cocking his head to look at you as he zipped up his backpack. </p><p>\u201cMy legs hurt,\u201d you admitted quietly, voice hoarse. \u201cThirsty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Taehyung muttered, stroking hairs away from your damp forehead. \u201cWe\u2019ll find somewhere to stay, I promise, and I\u2019ll find us something to drink. Just&hellip;don\u2019t close your eyes, okay? Try and stay awake for me, okay?\u201d</p><p>Keeping your eyes open as he helped lift you off the floor felt like the most impossible thing in an impossible world. \u201cI\u2019m gonna die from dehydration. Isn\u2019t that hilarious?\u201d</p><p>He grunted, supporting your weight. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to think like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018m gonna die on you,\u201d you continued, attempting to walk without his help. \u201cI\u2019m the leader and I\u2019ve led you to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think like that,\u201d Taehyung replied, out of breath slightly as he carried himself and your weight down a short flight of stairs. Despite being your companion crossing the country, he wasn\u2019t sure if he was comfortable enough calling you a friend, yet. There was a tension, an unspoken thing between the two of you - a refusal to get to know each other, but an urge to know everything at once. Taehyung never asked questions, feeling he wasn\u2019t close enough to get the answers. Still, same as before, he needed you to survive, and you needed him, now more than ever. \u201cYou can\u2019t let it guilt you. Stop talking, it\u2019s gonna wear you out. Just stay quiet and keep walking, okay? I\u2019m right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the worst leader.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNu-huh. You\u2019re the best leader, okay? You\u2019ve got us so far. Don\u2019t give up now, come on.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>Heaving himself forwards through the closed iron door, a flood of light made you grimace with a loud hiss, bringing your sleeve to cover your eyes as Taehyung carried you across the length of the car-park. Occasionally he would stumble, jumping you back up straight with an arm around his shoulders, your legs giving away and dragging like a doll across the concrete. </p><p>\u201cHey, <i>hey</i>, stay awake, okay?\u201d Taehyung said, his voice more frantic now, as he crouched his head to look at your face closer. The sweat had opened up your pores, and your dark circles were even more prominent as a feature of your face. He didn\u2019t mind. \u201cEyes on me, Y/N. Can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>An incoherent grumble was good enough and he cursed softly, walking quicker across the park, his breaths laboured and a line of sweat building up at his hairline, his fringe sticking like mixture to a bowl to his forehead. Each step was followed with a breathless, \u201c<i>please</i>,\u201d, his fingers tightening on your skin, his heart physically hurting at the thought of letting you down&hellip;just a bit further, now. Just a little bit further-</p><p>Losing his steps, stumbling over his own feet as you hung limp by his side, Taehyung let you fall to the ground with a soft exhale of breath, your hair spilling out like a halo around your head. The sun was hot on his skin as he bent over you, checking for a pulse, relieved when he found it. By now, you were unresponsive. </p><p>He was panicked- his hands trembled as he cradled your face in his hands, calling you back to him, searching for a response in your face. Never before had he felt so afraid at the thought of being alone in this world, alone without a companion- without a possible friend. <i>Without you</i>.</p><p><i>\u201cStop right there!\u201d</i></p><p>Hands still cradling your face, Taehyung looked up immediately, his eyes squinting in the midday sunlight. In a few seconds, they focused on a dark silhouette standing on top of a barricaded storage container, painted a navy blue with the words, \u201c<i><small>WILL SHOOT ON SIGHT!</small></i>\u201d sprayed on. Clearly he hadn\u2019t noticed that. He was mostly thankful they hadn\u2019t shot on sight. The figure did not move, standing still with their gun pointed in his direction. Without looking, too, Taehyung could sense about three other bandits pointing guns at him, masks pulled up over their faces, caps covering eyes. </p><p>\u201cPlease-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you infected?\u201d the same voice called, gruff and loud. A shooter nearby shot down an approaching biter, slow in movement but regardless, still a threat. </p><p>\u201cWhat? <i>No</i>, we-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she bit?\u201d the voice repeated, pointing the gun at your body laying on the floor, sweat pooling by your arms. Taehyung looked down at you worriedly and then looked back up.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he was confident.</p><p>The figure lowered their gun for a moment. \u201cIs she <i>dead</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Taehyung replied without a second of breath. \u201c<i>No</i>! We\u2019ve been walking for days and we ran out of water. She\u2019s dehydrated.\u201d</p><p>A second shooter scurried across the top of the container. \u201cThe girl\u2019s down. Not a threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnybody who\u2019s not <i>us</i> is a threat.\u201d</p><p>The second shooter frowned behind the mask. \u201cGive them the water. They ain\u2019t a threat to us yet. You\u2019d want them to do the same.\u201d</p><p>Although he seemed irritated, the first figure lowered his gun and pushed past the female shooter, hopping down from the container onto the floor. The girl remained indifferent, glancing at Taehyung in the middle of the street. Wordless, she waved her hand and the containers swiftly shifted, as if on cue, revealing a gate into a cluttered road, decorated with newspapers and large crates with, \u201c<small><i>NORTHGATE</i></small>\u201d engraved on them. Taehyung let out a sigh of immense relief, shifting to collect you in his arms, and without objection, moved towards the gates.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"57\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aa19131eb99b8342666d76442acab505/tumblr_inline_pp4mh8uJ7Q1vmnd3l_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"57\"/></figure><blockquote><p><b>NEW YORK CITY, DECEMBER, 3 YEARS AGO.<br/>2 WEEKS BEFORE THE OUTBREAK.</b></p></blockquote><p>\u201cWhat a way to spend Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung had never spent a Christmas away from his family.\u00a0Of course, with his sister being a second year student at NYU, she was breezing through her second Christmas away with ease. To the corner of her dorm room, a Christmas tree shedding bristles stood at an angle, with ugly decorations and a sponge at the top acting as the star- \u201cChristmas on a budget,\u201d she said when he mentioned it, and he laughed. In a room further down the hall, her roommates finished wrapping their gifts to give out in three days time, and Taehyung, amongst the sound of carols, focused his attention on the thickening pile of snow on the windowpane outside, the frost glued to the glass in web decorations.</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Taehyung replied animatedly, turning his attention to his sister who sat down on the circle carpet in front of him. She wore a bright green jumper decorated in gingham and flashing bulbs sewn into the wool, and plain black leggings with fluffy red and white socks. On her hair, a set of reindeer ears finished her look, meanwhile Taehyung settled with a similar jumper and bare feet, numbed by the fire. </p><p>His sister\u2019s dorm sufficed as home. For now, at least.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we can\u2019t make it home this year,\u201d she continued, dunking a Custard Cream into her hot chocolate. \u201cYou think they\u2019re okay back home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t afford to think any different,\u201d Taehyung replied, trying to remain optimistic. But with upper-New York in quarantine, and evacuations running almost daily, he was finding it harder to hang onto hope. \u201cWe\u2019ll catch a flight when the airlines are back open. Knowing Dad, he\u2019s probably taken them all to Grandma\u2019s place. For comfort, and safety, while the raids finish. Did you hear about the riots in Detroit the other day?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cScary stuff. I did some research before the internet shut down in the dorms, and it doesn\u2019t look as extreme in Korea. I mean, the President was assassinated and there\u2019s currently no stable Government, but, aside from that, everything seemed to be in working order. <i>Daegu</i> was fine, at least. I didn\u2019t look anywhere else.\u201d</p><p>At that, Mandy, a second roommate, stepped out from the thin corridor. \u201cI heard England was the same. Brits executed their prime-minister a few nights ago. There was articles about them wanting to have Tom Hiddleston as the leader of the UK, which, to be honest, sounds pretty good. I\u2019d go visit.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, his sister thought nothing of it. She turned to Taehyung with a gentle gaze, not enough to cause panic, but enough to send a message without words. </p><p>\u201cDid your friends leave campus already?\u201d Mandy asked Taehyung, switching on the kettle. The TV fizzled to a static and she frowned, \u201c<i>great</i>. Looks like the power\u2019s cutting out too. Is it this bad in the Halls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe still have internet. And, a <i>few</i> left campus. I think Zac is still in the dorms, though. He hasn\u2019t left in a couple of days. He said he wasn\u2019t feeling well. Figures he got sick from walking past the quarantine zone. I didn\u2019t wanna take chances so I haven\u2019t been there in a couple days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should stay here for the night,\u201d Mandy offered kindly, sipping her freshly brewed tea. \u201cI mean, until the storm has thawed. If Zac is sick, we don\u2019t want you to catch it. We can drop by on the way to the student store in the morning and get your things. I don\u2019t think the airlines are gonna reopen anytime soon, and subways were closed months ago, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll catch a ride on the bus in this weather. We\u2019ll have to hole up in here until the military says it\u2019s safe to leave.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung accepted, taking a blanket from Mandy after she hurried to their storage closet to fish one out, with pillows spare for the couch, a new makeshift bed in front of the roaring fire. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be together if anything bad happens,\u201d his sister said, in a whisper, minutes before mandatory curfew at 9pm. \u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Taehyung replied, his hand gripping her own. \u201cI promise&hellip;\u201d</p><blockquote><p><b>PRESENT DAY. <small><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMjviNT8ssY\">[x]</a></small></b></p></blockquote><p>At the sound of bed sheets rustling, Taehyung jolted awake. Unable to differentiate the past and the present, Taehyung opened his eyes expecting to see the fireplace, and the Christmas tree, and his sister on the circle rug. Instead, he noticed an unfamiliar room, drowned in a desert-beige, the light peeping in from a rectangular barred window. </p><p>He dragged the chair he had fallen asleep on closer to the army bed you were lying on, the noise as grating as the sound of chalk on a blackboard. Checking for injuries, his hands smoothed away strands of hair from your face, the trembling anxiety faded but still present if he really concentrated. </p><p>With a groan, you tried to sit up, but his hands came to your shoulders and settled you back on the canvas sheets. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asked, avoiding the question.</p><p>You pondered the question- \u201cstiff. But I\u2019m okay. What is this place?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung looked over his shoulder at the empty room. \u201cYou were passed out on the road when they found us. We were headed for their camp and they stopped me for questioning. They let us in, gave you water, let you rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d your voice said, scratchy. By the headboard of the small, iron bed, Taehyung reached for a glass of warming water, handing it to you quickly. \u201cThankyou.\u201d You swallowed half the water. \u201cAre we staying here?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung looked hesitant, taking a sip from the almost empty cup and setting it back down on the table. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we can trust these people. At the very least, we\u2019ll stay for the night. They could give us some supplies to leave. I\u2019m already running low on ammo, and we have nothing left to eat. I don\u2019t think we have any other choice <i>but</i> to stay.\u201d</p><p>You knew that there was no other way. Despite his efforts to keep you down, you shuffled back up off the bed, your back leaning with a heavy thud against the drywall. Taehyung pushed back on his chair, his hands knitted together anxiously as he watched you grimace, and scratch your throat absentmindedly.</p><p>\u201cHow long have we been here?\u201d you asked.</p><p>\u201cNot long,\u201d Taehyung said quietly, looking the window to see the falling sunlight change angles. \u201cIt\u2019s been a couple hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they at least <i>nice</i>? Does the camp look secure?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung opened his mouth, but paused, trying to find the right words. \u201cIt\u2019s not a camp. It\u2019s more like, a street. A small little community of really <i>angry</i> people. I didn\u2019t get to look around much, but I overheard one of the shooters saying that there was another small group of survivors outside near the farm. But, from what I heard, I think we got lucky being let inside.\u201d</p><p>Having nothing of value to say in reply, you simply stayed quiet. Picking the skin around your nails, Taehyung shuffled back on the chair and pulled it to the wall with the window, standing on the plastic and peeking outside. The window was on the ground, meaning you weren\u2019t, and he gulped at the sight of jeep wheels driving past, and black boots, similar to the military. It reminded him of New York, and the night before the bombing of the quarantine near NYU. He cringed and moved away, placing the chair back near the bed and hovering nearby, debating whether to sit or stand.</p><p>\u201cYou talk in your sleep, too,\u201d you said quietly, meeting his gaze as it fluttered up from beneath his overgrown fringe. He offered a lopsided smile, curious yet nervous all at once. </p><p>\u201cYeah? Must have picked it up from you.\u201d Instead of the chair, he sat on the bed. \u201cDid I say anything funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Most of it was mumbles,\u201d you replied, smiling up at him. </p><p>Taehyung laughed through his nose, his face downcast and fingers twiddling in his lap. \u201cAh, pity. I wish we still had cameras, you could have filmed it for fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I still had my camera, so I could look back on my life before now,\u201d you answered, after a short delay of silence. \u201cRemind myself of people\u2019s faces. Manipulate myself into thinking this is all a dream.\u201d</p><p>Without really thinking, Taehyung reached to grip your hand. These days, he hasn\u2019t really thought at all. You looked up at him, comforted at the way his hand felt on your own, smoothing circles into the skin of your knuckles, exploring the lines on your palm, fingering each separation. Oh, how beautiful it was, to find comfort in the presence of someone you barely knew, but trusted entirely. </p><p>\u201cThis won\u2019t be forever, Y/N,\u201d he said, with such a sincere and genuine voice that you felt your stomach knot and churn, a lump forming in your throat. Suddenly you need another drink of water. \u201cYou <i>won\u2019t</i> be sad forever.\u201d</p><p>Before you could reply, the door swung open, and his hands moved from your own back to his lap. He rose, too, reaching for the back of his jeans, gripping the pistol tucked inside. </p><p>The same female shooter from the container entered, her rifle swung over her shoulder, skin sweaty and tanned from the camo tank-top she wore underneath her black jacket, discarded somewhere. Taehyung remembered the details. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s awake, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you replied bluntly, polite enough to suffice as gratefulness. \u201cThank you. For letting us in.\u201d</p><p>The woman sighed, her shoulders sagging in the movement. \u201cWell, no need to thank me yet. It\u2019s still being cleared with the boss. Rules are rules. Feeling better, at least?\u201d</p><p>You nodded slightly, staring at Taehyung as he chose to speak for you. \u201cCan we leave this room, yet? It\u2019s stuffy, and I think she\u2019d like to walk for a while, isn\u2019t that right, Y/N?\u201d</p><p>He stared at you, sending messages without words. You nodded again, \u201cplease.\u201d</p><p>Rolling her shoulders, the woman stepped to the side, leaving space for you to both walk out. \u201cDon\u2019t make yourself too at home, but you\u2019re free to look around. Inside this building is restricted to outsiders, but the outside near the farm is free. There\u2019s another group of survivors nearby- they\u2019re cranky and hostile, but, they had children. We <i>never</i> refuse kids.\u201d</p><p>Already, you were learning little things about this place. To be truthful, you didn\u2019t even know what to call where you were- were they captors? Saviours? Enemies? You hesitated to jump to conclusions, instead moving to follow Taehyung out of the confined room with a curt nod and no words. The woman didn\u2019t seem to mind; she slammed the door shut behind her and pointed her gun in the direction of a raised shutter, leading out to the luscious-looking farmland out back. She didn\u2019t follow. She took off in a different direction, signalling to her group with words neither you or Taehyung could understand.</p><p>\u201cI have a <i>really</i> bad feeling about this place,\u201d you admitted in a low voice, sticking to Taehyung\u2019s side like glue. The faint smell of sweat and grime that would have repelled you now comforted you instead, and without wanting to come across as unnecessarily clingy, you gently held onto the back of his shirt, letting him lead you out into the scorching sunlight. </p><p>\u201cHopefully,\u201d he began, setting off towards the red and white barn pushed towards the corner of the premises, \u201cwe won\u2019t be here long. As soon as we\u2019re clear to leave, we will.\u201d</p><p>Realistically, Taehyung knew what happened to newcomers who joined groups where everything felt perfect. Nothing was ever truly perfect, he thought, especially so in a post-apocalyptic world where dead people were coming to life to eat people. Taehyung had seen the movies, bought the T-shirt, played the game- he <i>knew</i> what happened. However, he hoped humanity had changed. He was willing to give this place a chance. If he wanted to survive another night, he\u2019d have to.</p><p>The barn was ordinary looking, painted a brick red with white outlines, the picture-perfect barn that every farm had on TV. Surrounding the barn, a field of dead crops created a barren landscape that everybody felt familiar with, the weather not being right to grow crops. Approaching the barn, Taehyung paused when he noticed a young child running out, chased playfully by a Saint Bernard whose pants were louder than birdsong. </p><p>It had been a long time since he had seen a child. Or a dog.</p><p>He headed towards the barn, smiling affectionately when the little boy looked over with curiosity, his eyes widening in surprise and fright and he yelped in alarm, running back inside the barn. Taehyung hesitated, making you stiffen behind him as the dog growled in your direction, only halting when a man came out of the barn with the child cowering behind his leg. He didn\u2019t look old enough to be a father, but a lot had happened since the outbreak. The man smiled nonetheless, his smile being nothing but warm and inviting. </p><p>\u201cHey, look, it\u2019s the newbies.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Newbies</i>?\u201d you mocked without thinking. Although Taehyung gave you a look of mild disappointment, the man did not deter, in-fact he laughed and placed his hands on his hips.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see new faces,\u201d he said earnestly. \u201cThey don\u2019t bring in new people often. Welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Taehyung. This is Y/N, we won\u2019t be here long,\u201d Taehyung promised, stretching out a hand and shaking the man\u2019s. The man laughed shortly, constantly smiling. His energy was like a breath of fresh air, almost enough to convince you that everything was normal. </p><p>\u201cNamjoon. This here is Daniel. Not mine, of course. There\u2019s a couple others in the back of the barn,\u201d the man- <i>Namjoon</i>- replied. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t place your money on getting out of this place so easily. We\u2019ve been here for a few weeks now. We planned to stay for three nights until Jenny\u2019s fever levelled out. They took her in for testing. Said she\u2019s in care, but we haven\u2019t seen her since then.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung moved to greet Daniel, crouching to his level. Meanwhile you stared blankly at Namjoon, an expression of doubt and question on your features. He noticed, but didn\u2019t comment.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t let you visit?\u201d you repeated. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Namjoon shrugged, nodding for you to follow him into the barn. \u201cApparently their main building is off-limits to outsiders. A lot of them in here think she\u2019s dead already. But, it\u2019s nice to keep holding onto hope.\u201d</p><p>Without approaching too closely, you made note of the six people in Namjoon\u2019s group, not including himself and Daniel, who was still outside with Taehyung, giggling innocently. What they lacked in looks they made up for in numbers- you hadn\u2019t seen a group look so wrecked in such pristine conditions. Namjoon had turned away, taking a seat on a bale of hay, stroking the Saint Bernard behind his ears lovingly. </p><p>\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d you asked, inching towards the dog whose tag read Leo. </p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t really tell us anything since we\u2019re outsiders,\u201d Namjoon began, occasionally looking up to make sure you were listening. He did that a lot. \u201cBut, a lot of their crates say Northgate. Nate says it\u2019s a military name, but we obviously can\u2019t prove that from in here, can we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it&hellip;<i>safe</i>?\u201d</p><p>Namjoon hesitated. \u201cI don\u2019t know. The <i>barn</i> is secure. I don\u2019t know much about the actual camp. We mostly stick to ourselves and do whatever they ask. We\u2019re in their territory, after-all. It started out good; they had enough food to go around, we joined them for dinner in their halls and there used to be pigs out in the fields. And then, it changed. They reduced our food supply and gave us small jobs to help out. We\u2019re doing it for Jenny, mostly, otherwise we would have tried to leave. One of our group members, David, left a few days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey let him go?\u201d you gasped, trying not to sound too unconvinced that he made it away. But, as expected, Namjoon nodded, thinking purely of the situation. You wondered if it was an act, a coping mechanism. The look of life and hope in his eyes made you feel somehow guilty. </p><p>\u201cThey asked us if we wanted to leave a few days after the food began running out. David was the only one to pick up and head out.\u201d</p><p><i>Why didn\u2019t you leave?</i></p><p>In reply, however, you said nothing. Nothing seemed like the right thing to say in that moment. Seeing someone so hopeful for the world to change made you feel at ease, almost comfortable in the new and unfamiliar setting. After petting Leo, you stood, turning around to head back towards the entrance to the barn. Daniel hurried past you on your way out, a smile on his face, hair now tied into a bobble above his forehead. Taehyung stood alone, now, outside, watching Daniel leave with a smile.</p><p>\u201cMaking friends?\u201d you asked, referencing Daniel.</p><p>Taehyung nodded with a hum. \u201cI love kids.\u201d</p><p>Meeting by his side, you stood in silence, both looking out towards the giant building you walked out of. It looked bigger on the outside- a giant bricked building, with modern windows and a slightly falling apart roof, but intimidating in size and length. It seemed never-ending.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung,\u201d you started, your voice quiet so that Namjoon or anybody else wouldn\u2019t hear, \u201cI <i>really</i> don\u2019t like this place. I don\u2019t think we should stay.\u201d</p><p>He looked over at you with a frown. \u201cYou heard what he said. They\u2019ve been here weeks and still haven\u2019t left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like that,\u201d you insisted, shaking your head. \u201cI\u2019ve seen <i>thousands</i> of movies like this one, Taehyung. I\u2019m telling you- this is <i>exactly</i> what happened in Season 4 of the <i>The Walking Dead</i>. They get to the safe place and then suddenly find out that the people they\u2019re staying with are <i>cannibals</i>-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being paranoid.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>No</i>,\u201d you reasoned, looking at his face, \u201cI\u2019m being realistic, <i>as usual</i>. Look, it\u2019s your call. If you wanna stay&hellip;we will. I\u2019m just putting it out there. Something doesn\u2019t feel right about this place.\u201d</p><p>Even though he sighed, Taehyung said nothing; instead, he nodded, patting your shoulder comfortingly. He continued to stare out towards the building, and his mouth dropped to a circle when he noticed two groupies heading in your direction, accompanied by a larger, more plump woman. He pointed it out silently, nudging your shoulder, and as you looked up, you recognised the same woman from earlier, and a shooter that Taehyung seemed to recognise as he jolted in discomfort by your side.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019ve found the barn!\u201d a voice nobody recognised called from across the lot. The larger woman came into view, the sun bouncing off her skin, a natural highlight made from sweat and grease blinding you as she got closer. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Rose. You must be the two newcomers everybody\u2019s talking about.\u201d</p><p>She looked at you specifically, \u201cit\u2019s good to hear you\u2019re back on your feet. I heard from Snowdon here that you were passed out when you arrived. How do you feel?\u201d</p><p>You squirmed. \u201cI\u2019m okay. I was just thirsty. I appreciate the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what,\u201d Rose started, her voice elevated in pitch as she turned to address Snowdon, the female member you barely knew, \u201cI think we should run some tests on this young lady. Make sure that nothing is wrong. Just for safety precautions, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, oh no,\u201d you replied, perhaps a bit too quickly for everybody looked at you with alarm. Rose raised her eyebrows subtly, and Snowdon paused in movement entirely, \u201cI\u2019m fine. Really. I don\u2019t think you need to take any tests. I feel great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019re sure,\u201d Rose said in reply. She looked silently at the two members behind her and they turned without further word. \u201cI just wanted to let you know that you\u2019re perfectly welcome to stay here for as long as you need. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t let you leave just yet, at least not until we know it\u2019s safe to reopen the gates. Until then, you\u2019re welcome to stay in the barn with the others. Dinner is usually at around sundown, sometimes it\u2019s earlier depending on the weather.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung, now slightly uncomfortable, nodded stiffly. \u201cWe won\u2019t be of any trouble. As soon as it\u2019s clear, we\u2019d like to head out. We\u2019re with a group, but we got separated. We\u2019re on our way to them, now. We can\u2019t be late.\u201d</p><p>Rose smiled, her face like plastic. She reminded you of a robot. \u201cI <i>do</i> hope it\u2019s doable.\u201d</p><p>The sound of Rose\u2019s voice must have alerted the others further in the barn, as the sound of footsteps made you look away from the woman and back towards the entrance, where several people you only saw from a distance came out, tanned and burnt, parched and weak. Daniel bounded forward with childlike interest, meanwhile a woman who looked like his mother, or something similar, tumbled after him.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d the woman said meekly, her voice quiet in comparison to Rose\u2019s challenging authority. \u201cI was wondering if Jenny was alright? We haven\u2019t heard from her in weeks. Is she okay? Is it possible to see her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Mommy?\u201d Daniel asked, innocent and oblivious to the world. Rose continued to smile.</p><p>\u201cI can arrange you to see her,\u201d she suggested. \u201cOnly two of you, though. The others do not take so kindly to strangers. I can allow you and the little one access to see her.\u201d She reached for a walkie-talkie burrowed in her pockets, \u201cNevis, please come out to the barn. The little one and his friend request to see the patient in Room 16. Show them the way.\u201d</p><p>At that, Namjoon came out, shielding the sun from his eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarely,\u201d Rose nodded. She seemed to not care for Namjoon, and turned back to Taehyung suddenly: \u201cforgive me for seeming so&hellip;brash, but I must ask if you have any weapons. It\u2019s against the rules.\u201d</p><p>You fought all urge to give away Taehyung\u2019s pistol tucked in the back of his jeans. If she knew that there was a weapon there, she didn\u2019t show it. Taehyung shook his head and folded his arms. </p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he lied smoothly. \u201cWe ran out of ammo before we got here, and when Y/N fell, I couldn\u2019t carry everything. I dropped most of the stuff along the way. The guards took the bat and the rifle. I have nothing else.\u201d</p><p>Rose hummed quietly. \u201cVery well.\u201d Nevis joined her side, the same man as before. He had removed his mask, revealing a gruesome scar across his cheek, a hollowness under his cheekbones. He remained emotionless as Rose showed him Daniel and the woman, and without question, he led them towards the building. </p><p>Watching as Rose followed, the group left behind at the barn remained quiet in return. The group went back inside, and Namjoon joined by your side as the shutter to the building closed with privacy, separating the barn and the rest of the camp entirely. It seemed to be quieter, then, without the whir of machinery and occasional scream, which you guessed was either from outside the camp or the cannibalistic lair you were putting money on existing.</p><p>\u201cI know you have a gun at the back of your jeans,\u201d Namjoon said simply, looking at neither you or Taehyung but straight ahead. \u201cLet\u2019s hope nobody finds it.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung gulped. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Namjoon looked over then, and it felt weird not seeing a smile on his face. For the first time since you had met him, he looked serious.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t say anything,\u201d he said honestly. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s <i>any</i> consolation- I don\u2019t trust them either. I just do and say what I have to to make it easier to stay.\u201d</p><hr><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://gwoongi.tumblr.com/post/184083185491/%F0%9D%97%8D%F0%9D%97%81%F0%9D%96%BE-%F0%9D%97%85%F0%9D%96%BA%F0%9D%97%8C%F0%9D%97%8D-%F0%9D%97%88%F0%9D%96%BF-%F0%9D%97%8E%F0%9D%97%8C-taehyung-4\">NEXT CHAPTER.</a></p></blockquote>",

Since leaving the car on the side of the road in the middle of Oklahoma, it had been just Taehyung and yourself, walking the open road, deprived of water and a place to sleep. It was impossible to tell where you were now, walking like biters yourselves, staggering across the dusty roads.</p>\n<p>Waking to the sound of refreshing birdsong, you squinted in the tawny sunlight. Rolling your head to your shoulder, your gaze landed on Taehyung crouched before you, the back of his hand pressed against your forehead worriedly, a frown etched to his lips. </p>\n<p>You yawned, and he moved away his hand. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a fever.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A shaky laugh left your lips. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t that funny.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>His boots shifted on the gravel of the floor inside the multi storey car-park, your back leaned against the graffiti covered wall. A halo above your head in yellow spray-paint, Taehyung figured you looked pretty despite looking as you&rsquo;d expect in an apocalypse. Though, he didn&rsquo;t bet that he looked any better. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Tired?&rdquo; he asked, cocking his head to look at you as he zipped up his backpack. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;My legs hurt,&rdquo; you admitted quietly, voice hoarse. &ldquo;Thirsty.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; Taehyung muttered, stroking hairs away from your damp forehead. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find somewhere to stay, I promise, and I&rsquo;ll find us something to drink. Just&hellip;don&rsquo;t close your eyes, okay? Try and stay awake for me, okay?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Keeping your eyes open as he helped lift you off the floor felt like the most impossible thing in an impossible world. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna die from dehydration. Isn&rsquo;t that hilarious?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He grunted, supporting your weight. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford to think like that.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;m gonna die on you,&rdquo; you continued, attempting to walk without his help. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the leader and I&rsquo;ve led you to death.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think like that,&rdquo; Taehyung replied, out of breath slightly as he carried himself and your weight down a short flight of stairs. Despite being your companion crossing the country, he wasn&rsquo;t sure if he was comfortable enough calling you a friend, yet. There was a tension, an unspoken thing between the two of you - a refusal to get to know each other, but an urge to know everything at once. Taehyung never asked questions, feeling he wasn&rsquo;t close enough to get the answers. Still, same as before, he needed you to survive, and you needed him, now more than ever. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t let it guilt you. Stop talking, it&rsquo;s gonna wear you out. Just stay quiet and keep walking, okay? I&rsquo;m right here.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the worst leader.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Nu-huh. You&rsquo;re the best leader, okay?

Since leaving the car on the side of the road in the middle of Oklahoma, it had been just Taehyung and yourself, walking the open road, deprived of water and a place to sleep. It was impossible to tell where you were now, walking like biters yourselves, staggering across the dusty roads.</p><p>Waking to the sound of refreshing birdsong, you squinted in the tawny sunlight. Rolling your head to your shoulder, your gaze landed on Taehyung crouched before you, the back of his hand pressed against your forehead worriedly, a frown etched to his lips. </p><p>You yawned, and he moved away his hand. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a fever.\u201d</p><p>A shaky laugh left your lips. \u201cAin\u2019t that funny.\u201d</p><p>His boots shifted on the gravel of the floor inside the multi storey car-park, your back leaned against the graffiti covered wall. A halo above your head in yellow spray-paint, Taehyung figured you looked pretty despite looking as you\u2019d expect in an apocalypse. Though, he didn\u2019t bet that he looked any better. </p><p>\u201cTired?\u201d he asked, cocking his head to look at you as he zipped up his backpack. </p><p>\u201cMy legs hurt,\u201d you admitted quietly, voice hoarse. \u201cThirsty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Taehyung muttered, stroking hairs away from your damp forehead. \u201cWe\u2019ll find somewhere to stay, I promise, and I\u2019ll find us something to drink. Just\u2026don\u2019t close your eyes, okay? Try and stay awake for me, okay?\u201d</p><p>Keeping your eyes open as he helped lift you off the floor felt like the most impossible thing in an impossible world. \u201cI\u2019m gonna die from dehydration. Isn\u2019t that hilarious?\u201d</p><p>He grunted, supporting your weight. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to think like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018m gonna die on you,\u201d you continued, attempting to walk without his help. \u201cI\u2019m the leader and I\u2019ve led you to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think like that,\u201d Taehyung replied, out of breath slightly as he carried himself and your weight down a short flight of stairs. Despite being your companion crossing the country, he wasn\u2019t sure if he was comfortable enough calling you a friend, yet. There was a tension, an unspoken thing between the two of you - a refusal to get to know each other, but an urge to know everything at once. Taehyung never asked questions, feeling he wasn\u2019t close enough to get the answers. Still, same as before, he needed you to survive, and you needed him, now more than ever. \u201cYou can\u2019t let it guilt you. Stop talking, it\u2019s gonna wear you out. Just stay quiet and keep walking, okay? I\u2019m right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the worst leader.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNu-huh. You\u2019re the best leader, okay? You\u2019ve got us so far. Don\u2019t give up now, come on.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Heaving himself forwards through the closed iron door, a flood of light made you grimace with a loud hiss, bringing your sleeve to cover your eyes as Taehyung carried you across the length of the car-park. Occasionally he would stumble, jumping you back up straight with an arm around his shoulders, your legs giving away and dragging like a doll across the concrete. </p><p>\u201cHey, <i>hey</i>, stay awake, okay?\u201d Taehyung said, his voice more frantic now, as he crouched his head to look at your face closer. The sweat had opened up your pores, and your dark circles were even more prominent as a feature of your face. He didn\u2019t mind. \u201cEyes on me, Y/N. Can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>An incoherent grumble was good enough and he cursed softly, walking quicker across the park, his breaths laboured and a line of sweat building up at his hairline, his fringe sticking like mixture to a bowl to his forehead. Each step was followed with a breathless, \u201c<i>please</i>,\u201d, his fingers tightening on your skin, his heart physically hurting at the thought of letting you down\u2026just a bit further, now. Just a little bit further-</p><p>Losing his steps, stumbling over his own feet as you hung limp by his side, Taehyung let you fall to the ground with a soft exhale of breath, your hair spilling out like a halo around your head. The sun was hot on his skin as he bent over you, checking for a pulse, relieved when he found it. By now, you were unresponsive. </p><p>He was panicked- his hands trembled as he cradled your face in his hands, calling you back to him, searching for a response in your face. Never before had he felt so afraid at the thought of being alone in this world, alone without a companion- without a possible friend. <i>Without you</i>.</p><p><i>\u201cStop right there!\u201d</i></p><p>Hands still cradling your face, Taehyung looked up immediately, his eyes squinting in the midday sunlight. In a few seconds, they focused on a dark silhouette standing on top of a barricaded storage container, painted a navy blue with the words, \u201c<i><small>WILL SHOOT ON SIGHT!</small></i>\u201d sprayed on. Clearly he hadn\u2019t noticed that. He was mostly thankful they hadn\u2019t shot on sight. The figure did not move, standing still with their gun pointed in his direction. Without looking, too, Taehyung could sense about three other bandits pointing guns at him, masks pulled up over their faces, caps covering eyes. </p><p>\u201cPlease-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you infected?\u201d the same voice called, gruff and loud. A shooter nearby shot down an approaching biter, slow in movement but regardless, still a threat. </p><p>\u201cWhat? <i>No</i>, we-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she bit?\u201d the voice repeated, pointing the gun at your body laying on the floor, sweat pooling by your arms. Taehyung looked down at you worriedly and then looked back up.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he was confident.</p><p>The figure lowered their gun for a moment. \u201cIs she <i>dead</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Taehyung replied without a second of breath. \u201c<i>No</i>! We\u2019ve been walking for days and we ran out of water. She\u2019s dehydrated.\u201d</p><p>A second shooter scurried across the top of the container. \u201cThe girl\u2019s down. Not a threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnybody who\u2019s not <i>us</i> is a threat.\u201d</p><p>The second shooter frowned behind the mask. \u201cGive them the water. They ain\u2019t a threat to us yet. You\u2019d want them to do the same.\u201d</p><p>Although he seemed irritated, the first figure lowered his gun and pushed past the female shooter, hopping down from the container onto the floor. The girl remained indifferent, glancing at Taehyung in the middle of the street. Wordless, she waved her hand and the containers swiftly shifted, as if on cue, revealing a gate into a cluttered road, decorated with newspapers and large crates with, \u201c<small><i>NORTHGATE</i></small>\u201d engraved on them. Taehyung let out a sigh of immense relief, shifting to collect you in his arms, and without objection, moved towards the gates.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"57\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aa19131eb99b8342666d76442acab505/tumblr_inline_pp4mh8uJ7Q1vmnd3l_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"57\"></figure><blockquote><p><b>NEW YORK CITY, DECEMBER, 3 YEARS AGO.<br>2 WEEKS BEFORE THE OUTBREAK.</b></p></blockquote><p>\u201cWhat a way to spend Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung had never spent a Christmas away from his family.\u00a0Of course, with his sister being a second year student at NYU, she was breezing through her second Christmas away with ease. To the corner of her dorm room, a Christmas tree shedding bristles stood at an angle, with ugly decorations and a sponge at the top acting as the star- \u201cChristmas on a budget,\u201d she said when he mentioned it, and he laughed. In a room further down the hall, her roommates finished wrapping their gifts to give out in three days time, and Taehyung, amongst the sound of carols, focused his attention on the thickening pile of snow on the windowpane outside, the frost glued to the glass in web decorations.</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Taehyung replied animatedly, turning his attention to his sister who sat down on the circle carpet in front of him. She wore a bright green jumper decorated in gingham and flashing bulbs sewn into the wool, and plain black leggings with fluffy red and white socks. On her hair, a set of reindeer ears finished her look, meanwhile Taehyung settled with a similar jumper and bare feet, numbed by the fire. </p><p>His sister\u2019s dorm sufficed as home. For now, at least.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we can\u2019t make it home this year,\u201d she continued, dunking a Custard Cream into her hot chocolate. \u201cYou think they\u2019re okay back home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t afford to think any different,\u201d Taehyung replied, trying to remain optimistic. But with upper-New York in quarantine, and evacuations running almost daily, he was finding it harder to hang onto hope. \u201cWe\u2019ll catch a flight when the airlines are back open. Knowing Dad, he\u2019s probably taken them all to Grandma\u2019s place. For comfort, and safety, while the raids finish. Did you hear about the riots in Detroit the other day?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cScary stuff. I did some research before the internet shut down in the dorms, and it doesn\u2019t look as extreme in Korea. I mean, the President was assassinated and there\u2019s currently no stable Government, but, aside from that, everything seemed to be in working order. <i>Daegu</i> was fine, at least. I didn\u2019t look anywhere else.\u201d</p><p>At that, Mandy, a second roommate, stepped out from the thin corridor. \u201cI heard England was the same. Brits executed their prime-minister a few nights ago. There was articles about them wanting to have Tom Hiddleston as the leader of the UK, which, to be honest, sounds pretty good. I\u2019d go visit.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, his sister thought nothing of it. She turned to Taehyung with a gentle gaze, not enough to cause panic, but enough to send a message without words. </p><p>\u201cDid your friends leave campus already?\u201d Mandy asked Taehyung, switching on the kettle. The TV fizzled to a static and she frowned, \u201c<i>great</i>. Looks like the power\u2019s cutting out too. Is it this bad in the Halls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe still have internet. And, a <i>few</i> left campus. I think Zac is still in the dorms, though. He hasn\u2019t left in a couple of days. He said he wasn\u2019t feeling well. Figures he got sick from walking past the quarantine zone. I didn\u2019t wanna take chances so I haven\u2019t been there in a couple days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should stay here for the night,\u201d Mandy offered kindly, sipping her freshly brewed tea. \u201cI mean, until the storm has thawed. If Zac is sick, we don\u2019t want you to catch it. We can drop by on the way to the student store in the morning and get your things. I don\u2019t think the airlines are gonna reopen anytime soon, and subways were closed months ago, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll catch a ride on the bus in this weather. We\u2019ll have to hole up in here until the military says it\u2019s safe to leave.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung accepted, taking a blanket from Mandy after she hurried to their storage closet to fish one out, with pillows spare for the couch, a new makeshift bed in front of the roaring fire. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be together if anything bad happens,\u201d his sister said, in a whisper, minutes before mandatory curfew at 9pm. \u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Taehyung replied, his hand gripping her own. \u201cI promise\u2026\u201d</p><blockquote><p><b>PRESENT DAY. <small><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMjviNT8ssY\">[x]</a></small></b></p></blockquote><p>At the sound of bed sheets rustling, Taehyung jolted awake. Unable to differentiate the past and the present, Taehyung opened his eyes expecting to see the fireplace, and the Christmas tree, and his sister on the circle rug. Instead, he noticed an unfamiliar room, drowned in a desert-beige, the light peeping in from a rectangular barred window. </p><p>He dragged the chair he had fallen asleep on closer to the army bed you were lying on, the noise as grating as the sound of chalk on a blackboard. Checking for injuries, his hands smoothed away strands of hair from your face, the trembling anxiety faded but still present if he really concentrated. </p><p>With a groan, you tried to sit up, but his hands came to your shoulders and settled you back on the canvas sheets. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asked, avoiding the question.</p><p>You pondered the question- \u201cstiff. But I\u2019m okay. What is this place?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung looked over his shoulder at the empty room. \u201cYou were passed out on the road when they found us. We were headed for their camp and they stopped me for questioning. They let us in, gave you water, let you rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d your voice said, scratchy. By the headboard of the small, iron bed, Taehyung reached for a glass of warming water, handing it to you quickly. \u201cThankyou.\u201d You swallowed half the water. \u201cAre we staying here?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung looked hesitant, taking a sip from the almost empty cup and setting it back down on the table. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we can trust these people. At the very least, we\u2019ll stay for the night. They could give us some supplies to leave. I\u2019m already running low on ammo, and we have nothing left to eat. I don\u2019t think we have any other choice <i>but</i> to stay.\u201d</p><p>You knew that there was no other way. Despite his efforts to keep you down, you shuffled back up off the bed, your back leaning with a heavy thud against the drywall. Taehyung pushed back on his chair, his hands knitted together anxiously as he watched you grimace, and scratch your throat absentmindedly.</p><p>\u201cHow long have we been here?\u201d you asked.</p><p>\u201cNot long,\u201d Taehyung said quietly, looking the window to see the falling sunlight change angles. \u201cIt\u2019s been a couple hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they at least <i>nice</i>? Does the camp look secure?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung opened his mouth, but paused, trying to find the right words. \u201cIt\u2019s not a camp. It\u2019s more like, a street. A small little community of really <i>angry</i> people. I didn\u2019t get to look around much, but I overheard one of the shooters saying that there was another small group of survivors outside near the farm. But, from what I heard, I think we got lucky being let inside.\u201d</p><p>Having nothing of value to say in reply, you simply stayed quiet. Picking the skin around your nails, Taehyung shuffled back on the chair and pulled it to the wall with the window, standing on the plastic and peeking outside. The window was on the ground, meaning you weren\u2019t, and he gulped at the sight of jeep wheels driving past, and black boots, similar to the military. It reminded him of New York, and the night before the bombing of the quarantine near NYU. He cringed and moved away, placing the chair back near the bed and hovering nearby, debating whether to sit or stand.</p><p>\u201cYou talk in your sleep, too,\u201d you said quietly, meeting his gaze as it fluttered up from beneath his overgrown fringe. He offered a lopsided smile, curious yet nervous all at once. </p><p>\u201cYeah? Must have picked it up from you.\u201d Instead of the chair, he sat on the bed. \u201cDid I say anything funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Most of it was mumbles,\u201d you replied, smiling up at him. </p><p>Taehyung laughed through his nose, his face downcast and fingers twiddling in his lap. \u201cAh, pity. I wish we still had cameras, you could have filmed it for fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I still had my camera, so I could look back on my life before now,\u201d you answered, after a short delay of silence. \u201cRemind myself of people\u2019s faces. Manipulate myself into thinking this is all a dream.\u201d</p><p>Without really thinking, Taehyung reached to grip your hand. These days, he hasn\u2019t really thought at all. You looked up at him, comforted at the way his hand felt on your own, smoothing circles into the skin of your knuckles, exploring the lines on your palm, fingering each separation. Oh, how beautiful it was, to find comfort in the presence of someone you barely knew, but trusted entirely. </p><p>\u201cThis won\u2019t be forever, Y/N,\u201d he said, with such a sincere and genuine voice that you felt your stomach knot and churn, a lump forming in your throat. Suddenly you need another drink of water. \u201cYou <i>won\u2019t</i> be sad forever.\u201d</p><p>Before you could reply, the door swung open, and his hands moved from your own back to his lap. He rose, too, reaching for the back of his jeans, gripping the pistol tucked inside. </p><p>The same female shooter from the container entered, her rifle swung over her shoulder, skin sweaty and tanned from the camo tank-top she wore underneath her black jacket, discarded somewhere. Taehyung remembered the details. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s awake, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you replied bluntly, polite enough to suffice as gratefulness. \u201cThank you. For letting us in.\u201d</p><p>The woman sighed, her shoulders sagging in the movement. \u201cWell, no need to thank me yet. It\u2019s still being cleared with the boss. Rules are rules. Feeling better, at least?\u201d</p><p>You nodded slightly, staring at Taehyung as he chose to speak for you. \u201cCan we leave this room, yet? It\u2019s stuffy, and I think she\u2019d like to walk for a while, isn\u2019t that right, Y/N?\u201d</p><p>He stared at you, sending messages without words. You nodded again, \u201cplease.\u201d</p><p>Rolling her shoulders, the woman stepped to the side, leaving space for you to both walk out. \u201cDon\u2019t make yourself too at home, but you\u2019re free to look around. Inside this building is restricted to outsiders, but the outside near the farm is free. There\u2019s another group of survivors nearby- they\u2019re cranky and hostile, but, they had children. We <i>never</i> refuse kids.\u201d</p><p>Already, you were learning little things about this place. To be truthful, you didn\u2019t even know what to call where you were- were they captors? Saviours? Enemies? You hesitated to jump to conclusions, instead moving to follow Taehyung out of the confined room with a curt nod and no words. The woman didn\u2019t seem to mind; she slammed the door shut behind her and pointed her gun in the direction of a raised shutter, leading out to the luscious-looking farmland out back. She didn\u2019t follow. She took off in a different direction, signalling to her group with words neither you or Taehyung could understand.</p><p>\u201cI have a <i>really</i> bad feeling about this place,\u201d you admitted in a low voice, sticking to Taehyung\u2019s side like glue. The faint smell of sweat and grime that would have repelled you now comforted you instead, and without wanting to come across as unnecessarily clingy, you gently held onto the back of his shirt, letting him lead you out into the scorching sunlight. </p><p>\u201cHopefully,\u201d he began, setting off towards the red and white barn pushed towards the corner of the premises, \u201cwe won\u2019t be here long. As soon as we\u2019re clear to leave, we will.\u201d</p><p>Realistically, Taehyung knew what happened to newcomers who joined groups where everything felt perfect. Nothing was ever truly perfect, he thought, especially so in a post-apocalyptic world where dead people were coming to life to eat people. Taehyung had seen the movies, bought the T-shirt, played the game- he <i>knew</i> what happened. However, he hoped humanity had changed. He was willing to give this place a chance. If he wanted to survive another night, he\u2019d have to.</p><p>The barn was ordinary looking, painted a brick red with white outlines, the picture-perfect barn that every farm had on TV. Surrounding the barn, a field of dead crops created a barren landscape that everybody felt familiar with, the weather not being right to grow crops. Approaching the barn, Taehyung paused when he noticed a young child running out, chased playfully by a Saint Bernard whose pants were louder than birdsong. </p><p>It had been a long time since he had seen a child. Or a dog.</p><p>He headed towards the barn, smiling affectionately when the little boy looked over with curiosity, his eyes widening in surprise and fright and he yelped in alarm, running back inside the barn. Taehyung hesitated, making you stiffen behind him as the dog growled in your direction, only halting when a man came out of the barn with the child cowering behind his leg. He didn\u2019t look old enough to be a father, but a lot had happened since the outbreak. The man smiled nonetheless, his smile being nothing but warm and inviting. </p><p>\u201cHey, look, it\u2019s the newbies.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Newbies</i>?\u201d you mocked without thinking. Although Taehyung gave you a look of mild disappointment, the man did not deter, in-fact he laughed and placed his hands on his hips.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see new faces,\u201d he said earnestly. \u201cThey don\u2019t bring in new people often. Welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Taehyung. This is Y/N, we won\u2019t be here long,\u201d Taehyung promised, stretching out a hand and shaking the man\u2019s. The man laughed shortly, constantly smiling. His energy was like a breath of fresh air, almost enough to convince you that everything was normal. </p><p>\u201cNamjoon. This here is Daniel. Not mine, of course. There\u2019s a couple others in the back of the barn,\u201d the man- <i>Namjoon</i>- replied. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t place your money on getting out of this place so easily. We\u2019ve been here for a few weeks now. We planned to stay for three nights until Jenny\u2019s fever levelled out. They took her in for testing. Said she\u2019s in care, but we haven\u2019t seen her since then.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung moved to greet Daniel, crouching to his level. Meanwhile you stared blankly at Namjoon, an expression of doubt and question on your features. He noticed, but didn\u2019t comment.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t let you visit?\u201d you repeated. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Namjoon shrugged, nodding for you to follow him into the barn. \u201cApparently their main building is off-limits to outsiders. A lot of them in here think she\u2019s dead already. But, it\u2019s nice to keep holding onto hope.\u201d</p><p>Without approaching too closely, you made note of the six people in Namjoon\u2019s group, not including himself and Daniel, who was still outside with Taehyung, giggling innocently. What they lacked in looks they made up for in numbers- you hadn\u2019t seen a group look so wrecked in such pristine conditions. Namjoon had turned away, taking a seat on a bale of hay, stroking the Saint Bernard behind his ears lovingly. </p><p>\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d you asked, inching towards the dog whose tag read Leo. </p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t really tell us anything since we\u2019re outsiders,\u201d Namjoon began, occasionally looking up to make sure you were listening. He did that a lot. \u201cBut, a lot of their crates say Northgate. Nate says it\u2019s a military name, but we obviously can\u2019t prove that from in here, can we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it\u2026<i>safe</i>?\u201d</p><p>Namjoon hesitated. \u201cI don\u2019t know. The <i>barn</i> is secure. I don\u2019t know much about the actual camp. We mostly stick to ourselves and do whatever they ask. We\u2019re in their territory, after-all. It started out good; they had enough food to go around, we joined them for dinner in their halls and there used to be pigs out in the fields. And then, it changed. They reduced our food supply and gave us small jobs to help out. We\u2019re doing it for Jenny, mostly, otherwise we would have tried to leave. One of our group members, David, left a few days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey let him go?\u201d you gasped, trying not to sound too unconvinced that he made it away. But, as expected, Namjoon nodded, thinking purely of the situation. You wondered if it was an act, a coping mechanism. The look of life and hope in his eyes made you feel somehow guilty. </p><p>\u201cThey asked us if we wanted to leave a few days after the food began running out. David was the only one to pick up and head out.\u201d</p><p><i>Why didn\u2019t you leave?</i></p><p>In reply, however, you said nothing. Nothing seemed like the right thing to say in that moment. Seeing someone so hopeful for the world to change made you feel at ease, almost comfortable in the new and unfamiliar setting. After petting Leo, you stood, turning around to head back towards the entrance to the barn. Daniel hurried past you on your way out, a smile on his face, hair now tied into a bobble above his forehead. Taehyung stood alone, now, outside, watching Daniel leave with a smile.</p><p>\u201cMaking friends?\u201d you asked, referencing Daniel.</p><p>Taehyung nodded with a hum. \u201cI love kids.\u201d</p><p>Meeting by his side, you stood in silence, both looking out towards the giant building you walked out of. It looked bigger on the outside- a giant bricked building, with modern windows and a slightly falling apart roof, but intimidating in size and length. It seemed never-ending.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung,\u201d you started, your voice quiet so that Namjoon or anybody else wouldn\u2019t hear, \u201cI <i>really</i> don\u2019t like this place. I don\u2019t think we should stay.\u201d</p><p>He looked over at you with a frown. \u201cYou heard what he said. They\u2019ve been here weeks and still haven\u2019t left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like that,\u201d you insisted, shaking your head. \u201cI\u2019ve seen <i>thousands</i> of movies like this one, Taehyung. I\u2019m telling you- this is <i>exactly</i> what happened in Season 4 of the <i>The Walking Dead</i>. They get to the safe place and then suddenly find out that the people they\u2019re staying with are <i>cannibals</i>-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being paranoid.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>No</i>,\u201d you reasoned, looking at his face, \u201cI\u2019m being realistic, <i>as usual</i>. Look, it\u2019s your call. If you wanna stay\u2026we will. I\u2019m just putting it out there. Something doesn\u2019t feel right about this place.\u201d</p><p>Even though he sighed, Taehyung said nothing; instead, he nodded, patting your shoulder comfortingly. He continued to stare out towards the building, and his mouth dropped to a circle when he noticed two groupies heading in your direction, accompanied by a larger, more plump woman. He pointed it out silently, nudging your shoulder, and as you looked up, you recognised the same woman from earlier, and a shooter that Taehyung seemed to recognise as he jolted in discomfort by your side.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019ve found the barn!\u201d a voice nobody recognised called from across the lot. The larger woman came into view, the sun bouncing off her skin, a natural highlight made from sweat and grease blinding you as she got closer. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Rose. You must be the two newcomers everybody\u2019s talking about.\u201d</p><p>She looked at you specifically, \u201cit\u2019s good to hear you\u2019re back on your feet. I heard from Snowdon here that you were passed out when you arrived. How do you feel?\u201d</p><p>You squirmed. \u201cI\u2019m okay. I was just thirsty. I appreciate the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what,\u201d Rose started, her voice elevated in pitch as she turned to address Snowdon, the female member you barely knew, \u201cI think we should run some tests on this young lady. Make sure that nothing is wrong. Just for safety precautions, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, oh no,\u201d you replied, perhaps a bit too quickly for everybody looked at you with alarm. Rose raised her eyebrows subtly, and Snowdon paused in movement entirely, \u201cI\u2019m fine. Really. I don\u2019t think you need to take any tests. I feel great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019re sure,\u201d Rose said in reply. She looked silently at the two members behind her and they turned without further word. \u201cI just wanted to let you know that you\u2019re perfectly welcome to stay here for as long as you need. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t let you leave just yet, at least not until we know it\u2019s safe to reopen the gates. Until then, you\u2019re welcome to stay in the barn with the others. Dinner is usually at around sundown, sometimes it\u2019s earlier depending on the weather.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung, now slightly uncomfortable, nodded stiffly. \u201cWe won\u2019t be of any trouble. As soon as it\u2019s clear, we\u2019d like to head out. We\u2019re with a group, but we got separated. We\u2019re on our way to them, now. We can\u2019t be late.\u201d</p><p>Rose smiled, her face like plastic. She reminded you of a robot. \u201cI <i>do</i> hope it\u2019s doable.\u201d</p><p>The sound of Rose\u2019s voice must have alerted the others further in the barn, as the sound of footsteps made you look away from the woman and back towards the entrance, where several people you only saw from a distance came out, tanned and burnt, parched and weak. Daniel bounded forward with childlike interest, meanwhile a woman who looked like his mother, or something similar, tumbled after him.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d the woman said meekly, her voice quiet in comparison to Rose\u2019s challenging authority. \u201cI was wondering if Jenny was alright? We haven\u2019t heard from her in weeks. Is she okay? Is it possible to see her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Mommy?\u201d Daniel asked, innocent and oblivious to the world. Rose continued to smile.</p><p>\u201cI can arrange you to see her,\u201d she suggested. \u201cOnly two of you, though. The others do not take so kindly to strangers. I can allow you and the little one access to see her.\u201d She reached for a walkie-talkie burrowed in her pockets, \u201cNevis, please come out to the barn. The little one and his friend request to see the patient in Room 16. Show them the way.\u201d</p><p>At that, Namjoon came out, shielding the sun from his eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarely,\u201d Rose nodded. She seemed to not care for Namjoon, and turned back to Taehyung suddenly: \u201cforgive me for seeming so\u2026brash, but I must ask if you have any weapons. It\u2019s against the rules.\u201d</p><p>You fought all urge to give away Taehyung\u2019s pistol tucked in the back of his jeans. If she knew that there was a weapon there, she didn\u2019t show it. Taehyung shook his head and folded his arms. </p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he lied smoothly. \u201cWe ran out of ammo before we got here, and when Y/N fell, I couldn\u2019t carry everything. I dropped most of the stuff along the way. The guards took the bat and the rifle. I have nothing else.\u201d</p><p>Rose hummed quietly. \u201cVery well.\u201d Nevis joined her side, the same man as before. He had removed his mask, revealing a gruesome scar across his cheek, a hollowness under his cheekbones. He remained emotionless as Rose showed him Daniel and the woman, and without question, he led them towards the building. </p><p>Watching as Rose followed, the group left behind at the barn remained quiet in return. The group went back inside, and Namjoon joined by your side as the shutter to the building closed with privacy, separating the barn and the rest of the camp entirely. It seemed to be quieter, then, without the whir of machinery and occasional scream, which you guessed was either from outside the camp or the cannibalistic lair you were putting money on existing.</p><p>\u201cI know you have a gun at the back of your jeans,\u201d Namjoon said simply, looking at neither you or Taehyung but straight ahead. \u201cLet\u2019s hope nobody finds it.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung gulped. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Namjoon looked over then, and it felt weird not seeing a smile on his face. For the first time since you had met him, he looked serious.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t say anything,\u201d he said honestly. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s <i>any</i> consolation- I don\u2019t trust them either. I just do and say what I have to to make it easier to stay.\u201d</p><hr><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://gwoongi.tumblr.com/post/184083185491/%F0%9D%97%8D%F0%9D%97%81%F0%9D%96%BE-%F0%9D%97%85%F0%9D%96%BA%F0%9D%97%8C%F0%9D%97%8D-%F0%9D%97%88%F0%9D%96%BF-%F0%9D%97%8E%F0%9D%97%8C-taehyung-4\">NEXT CHAPTER.</a></p></blockquote></p>",

Since leaving the car on the side of the road in the middle of Oklahoma, it had been just Taehyung and yourself, walking the open road, deprived of water and a place to sleep. It was impossible to tell where you were now, walking like biters yourselves, staggering across the dusty roads.</p><p>Waking to the sound of refreshing birdsong, you squinted in the tawny sunlight. Rolling your head to your shoulder, your gaze landed on Taehyung crouched before you, the back of his hand pressed against your forehead worriedly, a frown etched to his lips. </p><p>You yawned, and he moved away his hand. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a fever.\u201d</p><p>A shaky laugh left your lips. \u201cAin\u2019t that funny.\u201d</p><p>His boots shifted on the gravel of the floor inside the multi storey car-park, your back leaned against the graffiti covered wall. A halo above your head in yellow spray-paint, Taehyung figured you looked pretty despite looking as you\u2019d expect in an apocalypse. Though, he didn\u2019t bet that he looked any better. </p><p>\u201cTired?\u201d he asked, cocking his head to look at you as he zipped up his backpack. </p><p>\u201cMy legs hurt,\u201d you admitted quietly, voice hoarse. \u201cThirsty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Taehyung muttered, stroking hairs away from your damp forehead. \u201cWe\u2019ll find somewhere to stay, I promise, and I\u2019ll find us something to drink. Just\u2026don\u2019t close your eyes, okay? Try and stay awake for me, okay?\u201d</p><p>Keeping your eyes open as he helped lift you off the floor felt like the most impossible thing in an impossible world. \u201cI\u2019m gonna die from dehydration. Isn\u2019t that hilarious?\u201d</p><p>He grunted, supporting your weight. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to think like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018m gonna die on you,\u201d you continued, attempting to walk without his help. \u201cI\u2019m the leader and I\u2019ve led you to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think like that,\u201d Taehyung replied, out of breath slightly as he carried himself and your weight down a short flight of stairs. Despite being your companion crossing the country, he wasn\u2019t sure if he was comfortable enough calling you a friend, yet. There was a tension, an unspoken thing between the two of you - a refusal to get to know each other, but an urge to know everything at once. Taehyung never asked questions, feeling he wasn\u2019t close enough to get the answers. Still, same as before, he needed you to survive, and you needed him, now more than ever. \u201cYou can\u2019t let it guilt you. Stop talking, it\u2019s gonna wear you out. Just stay quiet and keep walking, okay? I\u2019m right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the worst leader.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNu-huh. You\u2019re the best leader, okay? You\u2019ve got us so far. Don\u2019t give up now, come on.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Heaving himself forwards through the closed iron door, a flood of light made you grimace with a loud hiss, bringing your sleeve to cover your eyes as Taehyung carried you across the length of the car-park. Occasionally he would stumble, jumping you back up straight with an arm around his shoulders, your legs giving away and dragging like a doll across the concrete. </p><p>\u201cHey, <i>hey</i>, stay awake, okay?\u201d Taehyung said, his voice more frantic now, as he crouched his head to look at your face closer. The sweat had opened up your pores, and your dark circles were even more prominent as a feature of your face. He didn\u2019t mind. \u201cEyes on me, Y/N. Can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>An incoherent grumble was good enough and he cursed softly, walking quicker across the park, his breaths laboured and a line of sweat building up at his hairline, his fringe sticking like mixture to a bowl to his forehead. Each step was followed with a breathless, \u201c<i>please</i>,\u201d, his fingers tightening on your skin, his heart physically hurting at the thought of letting you down\u2026just a bit further, now. Just a little bit further-</p><p>Losing his steps, stumbling over his own feet as you hung limp by his side, Taehyung let you fall to the ground with a soft exhale of breath, your hair spilling out like a halo around your head. The sun was hot on his skin as he bent over you, checking for a pulse, relieved when he found it. By now, you were unresponsive. </p><p>He was panicked- his hands trembled as he cradled your face in his hands, calling you back to him, searching for a response in your face. Never before had he felt so afraid at the thought of being alone in this world, alone without a companion- without a possible friend. <i>Without you</i>.</p><p><i>\u201cStop right there!\u201d</i></p><p>Hands still cradling your face, Taehyung looked up immediately, his eyes squinting in the midday sunlight. In a few seconds, they focused on a dark silhouette standing on top of a barricaded storage container, painted a navy blue with the words, \u201c<i><small>WILL SHOOT ON SIGHT!</small></i>\u201d sprayed on. Clearly he hadn\u2019t noticed that. He was mostly thankful they hadn\u2019t shot on sight. The figure did not move, standing still with their gun pointed in his direction. Without looking, too, Taehyung could sense about three other bandits pointing guns at him, masks pulled up over their faces, caps covering eyes. </p><p>\u201cPlease-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you infected?\u201d the same voice called, gruff and loud. A shooter nearby shot down an approaching biter, slow in movement but regardless, still a threat. </p><p>\u201cWhat? <i>No</i>, we-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she bit?\u201d the voice repeated, pointing the gun at your body laying on the floor, sweat pooling by your arms. Taehyung looked down at you worriedly and then looked back up.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he was confident.</p><p>The figure lowered their gun for a moment. \u201cIs she <i>dead</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Taehyung replied without a second of breath. \u201c<i>No</i>! We\u2019ve been walking for days and we ran out of water. She\u2019s dehydrated.\u201d</p><p>A second shooter scurried across the top of the container. \u201cThe girl\u2019s down. Not a threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnybody who\u2019s not <i>us</i> is a threat.\u201d</p><p>The second shooter frowned behind the mask. \u201cGive them the water. They ain\u2019t a threat to us yet. You\u2019d want them to do the same.\u201d</p><p>Although he seemed irritated, the first figure lowered his gun and pushed past the female shooter, hopping down from the container onto the floor. The girl remained indifferent, glancing at Taehyung in the middle of the street. Wordless, she waved her hand and the containers swiftly shifted, as if on cue, revealing a gate into a cluttered road, decorated with newspapers and large crates with, \u201c<small><i>NORTHGATE</i></small>\u201d engraved on them. Taehyung let out a sigh of immense relief, shifting to collect you in his arms, and without objection, moved towards the gates.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"57\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aa19131eb99b8342666d76442acab505/tumblr_inline_pp4mh8uJ7Q1vmnd3l_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"57\"></figure><blockquote><p><b>NEW YORK CITY, DECEMBER, 3 YEARS AGO.<br>2 WEEKS BEFORE THE OUTBREAK.</b></p></blockquote><p>\u201cWhat a way to spend Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung had never spent a Christmas away from his family.\u00a0Of course, with his sister being a second year student at NYU, she was breezing through her second Christmas away with ease. To the corner of her dorm room, a Christmas tree shedding bristles stood at an angle, with ugly decorations and a sponge at the top acting as the star- \u201cChristmas on a budget,\u201d she said when he mentioned it, and he laughed. In a room further down the hall, her roommates finished wrapping their gifts to give out in three days time, and Taehyung, amongst the sound of carols, focused his attention on the thickening pile of snow on the windowpane outside, the frost glued to the glass in web decorations.</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Taehyung replied animatedly, turning his attention to his sister who sat down on the circle carpet in front of him. She wore a bright green jumper decorated in gingham and flashing bulbs sewn into the wool, and plain black leggings with fluffy red and white socks. On her hair, a set of reindeer ears finished her look, meanwhile Taehyung settled with a similar jumper and bare feet, numbed by the fire. </p><p>His sister\u2019s dorm sufficed as home. For now, at least.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we can\u2019t make it home this year,\u201d she continued, dunking a Custard Cream into her hot chocolate. \u201cYou think they\u2019re okay back home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t afford to think any different,\u201d Taehyung replied, trying to remain optimistic. But with upper-New York in quarantine, and evacuations running almost daily, he was finding it harder to hang onto hope. \u201cWe\u2019ll catch a flight when the airlines are back open. Knowing Dad, he\u2019s probably taken them all to Grandma\u2019s place. For comfort, and safety, while the raids finish. Did you hear about the riots in Detroit the other day?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cScary stuff. I did some research before the internet shut down in the dorms, and it doesn\u2019t look as extreme in Korea. I mean, the President was assassinated and there\u2019s currently no stable Government, but, aside from that, everything seemed to be in working order. <i>Daegu</i> was fine, at least. I didn\u2019t look anywhere else.\u201d</p><p>At that, Mandy, a second roommate, stepped out from the thin corridor. \u201cI heard England was the same. Brits executed their prime-minister a few nights ago. There was articles about them wanting to have Tom Hiddleston as the leader of the UK, which, to be honest, sounds pretty good. I\u2019d go visit.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, his sister thought nothing of it. She turned to Taehyung with a gentle gaze, not enough to cause panic, but enough to send a message without words. </p><p>\u201cDid your friends leave campus already?\u201d Mandy asked Taehyung, switching on the kettle. The TV fizzled to a static and she frowned, \u201c<i>great</i>. Looks like the power\u2019s cutting out too. Is it this bad in the Halls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe still have internet. And, a <i>few</i> left campus. I think Zac is still in the dorms, though. He hasn\u2019t left in a couple of days. He said he wasn\u2019t feeling well. Figures he got sick from walking past the quarantine zone. I didn\u2019t wanna take chances so I haven\u2019t been there in a couple days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should stay here for the night,\u201d Mandy offered kindly, sipping her freshly brewed tea. \u201cI mean, until the storm has thawed. If Zac is sick, we don\u2019t want you to catch it. We can drop by on the way to the student store in the morning and get your things. I don\u2019t think the airlines are gonna reopen anytime soon, and subways were closed months ago, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll catch a ride on the bus in this weather. We\u2019ll have to hole up in here until the military says it\u2019s safe to leave.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung accepted, taking a blanket from Mandy after she hurried to their storage closet to fish one out, with pillows spare for the couch, a new makeshift bed in front of the roaring fire. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be together if anything bad happens,\u201d his sister said, in a whisper, minutes before mandatory curfew at 9pm. \u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Taehyung replied, his hand gripping her own. \u201cI promise\u2026\u201d</p><blockquote><p><b>PRESENT DAY. <small><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMjviNT8ssY\">[x]</a></small></b></p></blockquote><p>At the sound of bed sheets rustling, Taehyung jolted awake. Unable to differentiate the past and the present, Taehyung opened his eyes expecting to see the fireplace, and the Christmas tree, and his sister on the circle rug. Instead, he noticed an unfamiliar room, drowned in a desert-beige, the light peeping in from a rectangular barred window. </p><p>He dragged the chair he had fallen asleep on closer to the army bed you were lying on, the noise as grating as the sound of chalk on a blackboard. Checking for injuries, his hands smoothed away strands of hair from your face, the trembling anxiety faded but still present if he really concentrated. </p><p>With a groan, you tried to sit up, but his hands came to your shoulders and settled you back on the canvas sheets. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asked, avoiding the question.</p><p>You pondered the question- \u201cstiff. But I\u2019m okay. What is this place?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung looked over his shoulder at the empty room. \u201cYou were passed out on the road when they found us. We were headed for their camp and they stopped me for questioning. They let us in, gave you water, let you rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d your voice said, scratchy. By the headboard of the small, iron bed, Taehyung reached for a glass of warming water, handing it to you quickly. \u201cThankyou.\u201d You swallowed half the water. \u201cAre we staying here?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung looked hesitant, taking a sip from the almost empty cup and setting it back down on the table. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we can trust these people. At the very least, we\u2019ll stay for the night. They could give us some supplies to leave. I\u2019m already running low on ammo, and we have nothing left to eat. I don\u2019t think we have any other choice <i>but</i> to stay.\u201d</p><p>You knew that there was no other way. Despite his efforts to keep you down, you shuffled back up off the bed, your back leaning with a heavy thud against the drywall. Taehyung pushed back on his chair, his hands knitted together anxiously as he watched you grimace, and scratch your throat absentmindedly.</p><p>\u201cHow long have we been here?\u201d you asked.</p><p>\u201cNot long,\u201d Taehyung said quietly, looking the window to see the falling sunlight change angles. \u201cIt\u2019s been a couple hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they at least <i>nice</i>? Does the camp look secure?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung opened his mouth, but paused, trying to find the right words. \u201cIt\u2019s not a camp. It\u2019s more like, a street. A small little community of really <i>angry</i> people. I didn\u2019t get to look around much, but I overheard one of the shooters saying that there was another small group of survivors outside near the farm. But, from what I heard, I think we got lucky being let inside.\u201d</p><p>Having nothing of value to say in reply, you simply stayed quiet. Picking the skin around your nails, Taehyung shuffled back on the chair and pulled it to the wall with the window, standing on the plastic and peeking outside. The window was on the ground, meaning you weren\u2019t, and he gulped at the sight of jeep wheels driving past, and black boots, similar to the military. It reminded him of New York, and the night before the bombing of the quarantine near NYU. He cringed and moved away, placing the chair back near the bed and hovering nearby, debating whether to sit or stand.</p><p>\u201cYou talk in your sleep, too,\u201d you said quietly, meeting his gaze as it fluttered up from beneath his overgrown fringe. He offered a lopsided smile, curious yet nervous all at once. </p><p>\u201cYeah? Must have picked it up from you.\u201d Instead of the chair, he sat on the bed. \u201cDid I say anything funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Most of it was mumbles,\u201d you replied, smiling up at him. </p><p>Taehyung laughed through his nose, his face downcast and fingers twiddling in his lap. \u201cAh, pity. I wish we still had cameras, you could have filmed it for fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I still had my camera, so I could look back on my life before now,\u201d you answered, after a short delay of silence. \u201cRemind myself of people\u2019s faces. Manipulate myself into thinking this is all a dream.\u201d</p><p>Without really thinking, Taehyung reached to grip your hand. These days, he hasn\u2019t really thought at all. You looked up at him, comforted at the way his hand felt on your own, smoothing circles into the skin of your knuckles, exploring the lines on your palm, fingering each separation. Oh, how beautiful it was, to find comfort in the presence of someone you barely knew, but trusted entirely. </p><p>\u201cThis won\u2019t be forever, Y/N,\u201d he said, with such a sincere and genuine voice that you felt your stomach knot and churn, a lump forming in your throat. Suddenly you need another drink of water. \u201cYou <i>won\u2019t</i> be sad forever.\u201d</p><p>Before you could reply, the door swung open, and his hands moved from your own back to his lap. He rose, too, reaching for the back of his jeans, gripping the pistol tucked inside. </p><p>The same female shooter from the container entered, her rifle swung over her shoulder, skin sweaty and tanned from the camo tank-top she wore underneath her black jacket, discarded somewhere. Taehyung remembered the details. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s awake, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you replied bluntly, polite enough to suffice as gratefulness. \u201cThank you. For letting us in.\u201d</p><p>The woman sighed, her shoulders sagging in the movement. \u201cWell, no need to thank me yet. It\u2019s still being cleared with the boss. Rules are rules. Feeling better, at least?\u201d</p><p>You nodded slightly, staring at Taehyung as he chose to speak for you. \u201cCan we leave this room, yet? It\u2019s stuffy, and I think she\u2019d like to walk for a while, isn\u2019t that right, Y/N?\u201d</p><p>He stared at you, sending messages without words. You nodded again, \u201cplease.\u201d</p><p>Rolling her shoulders, the woman stepped to the side, leaving space for you to both walk out. \u201cDon\u2019t make yourself too at home, but you\u2019re free to look around. Inside this building is restricted to outsiders, but the outside near the farm is free. There\u2019s another group of survivors nearby- they\u2019re cranky and hostile, but, they had children. We <i>never</i> refuse kids.\u201d</p><p>Already, you were learning little things about this place. To be truthful, you didn\u2019t even know what to call where you were- were they captors? Saviours? Enemies? You hesitated to jump to conclusions, instead moving to follow Taehyung out of the confined room with a curt nod and no words. The woman didn\u2019t seem to mind; she slammed the door shut behind her and pointed her gun in the direction of a raised shutter, leading out to the luscious-looking farmland out back. She didn\u2019t follow. She took off in a different direction, signalling to her group with words neither you or Taehyung could understand.</p><p>\u201cI have a <i>really</i> bad feeling about this place,\u201d you admitted in a low voice, sticking to Taehyung\u2019s side like glue. The faint smell of sweat and grime that would have repelled you now comforted you instead, and without wanting to come across as unnecessarily clingy, you gently held onto the back of his shirt, letting him lead you out into the scorching sunlight. </p><p>\u201cHopefully,\u201d he began, setting off towards the red and white barn pushed towards the corner of the premises, \u201cwe won\u2019t be here long. As soon as we\u2019re clear to leave, we will.\u201d</p><p>Realistically, Taehyung knew what happened to newcomers who joined groups where everything felt perfect. Nothing was ever truly perfect, he thought, especially so in a post-apocalyptic world where dead people were coming to life to eat people. Taehyung had seen the movies, bought the T-shirt, played the game- he <i>knew</i> what happened. However, he hoped humanity had changed. He was willing to give this place a chance. If he wanted to survive another night, he\u2019d have to.</p><p>The barn was ordinary looking, painted a brick red with white outlines, the picture-perfect barn that every farm had on TV. Surrounding the barn, a field of dead crops created a barren landscape that everybody felt familiar with, the weather not being right to grow crops. Approaching the barn, Taehyung paused when he noticed a young child running out, chased playfully by a Saint Bernard whose pants were louder than birdsong. </p><p>It had been a long time since he had seen a child. Or a dog.</p><p>He headed towards the barn, smiling affectionately when the little boy looked over with curiosity, his eyes widening in surprise and fright and he yelped in alarm, running back inside the barn. Taehyung hesitated, making you stiffen behind him as the dog growled in your direction, only halting when a man came out of the barn with the child cowering behind his leg. He didn\u2019t look old enough to be a father, but a lot had happened since the outbreak. The man smiled nonetheless, his smile being nothing but warm and inviting. </p><p>\u201cHey, look, it\u2019s the newbies.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Newbies</i>?\u201d you mocked without thinking. Although Taehyung gave you a look of mild disappointment, the man did not deter, in-fact he laughed and placed his hands on his hips.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see new faces,\u201d he said earnestly. \u201cThey don\u2019t bring in new people often. Welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Taehyung. This is Y/N, we won\u2019t be here long,\u201d Taehyung promised, stretching out a hand and shaking the man\u2019s. The man laughed shortly, constantly smiling. His energy was like a breath of fresh air, almost enough to convince you that everything was normal. </p><p>\u201cNamjoon. This here is Daniel. Not mine, of course. There\u2019s a couple others in the back of the barn,\u201d the man- <i>Namjoon</i>- replied. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t place your money on getting out of this place so easily. We\u2019ve been here for a few weeks now. We planned to stay for three nights until Jenny\u2019s fever levelled out. They took her in for testing. Said she\u2019s in care, but we haven\u2019t seen her since then.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung moved to greet Daniel, crouching to his level. Meanwhile you stared blankly at Namjoon, an expression of doubt and question on your features. He noticed, but didn\u2019t comment.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t let you visit?\u201d you repeated. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Namjoon shrugged, nodding for you to follow him into the barn. \u201cApparently their main building is off-limits to outsiders. A lot of them in here think she\u2019s dead already. But, it\u2019s nice to keep holding onto hope.\u201d</p><p>Without approaching too closely, you made note of the six people in Namjoon\u2019s group, not including himself and Daniel, who was still outside with Taehyung, giggling innocently. What they lacked in looks they made up for in numbers- you hadn\u2019t seen a group look so wrecked in such pristine conditions. Namjoon had turned away, taking a seat on a bale of hay, stroking the Saint Bernard behind his ears lovingly. </p><p>\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d you asked, inching towards the dog whose tag read Leo. </p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t really tell us anything since we\u2019re outsiders,\u201d Namjoon began, occasionally looking up to make sure you were listening. He did that a lot. \u201cBut, a lot of their crates say Northgate. Nate says it\u2019s a military name, but we obviously can\u2019t prove that from in here, can we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it\u2026<i>safe</i>?\u201d</p><p>Namjoon hesitated. \u201cI don\u2019t know. The <i>barn</i> is secure. I don\u2019t know much about the actual camp. We mostly stick to ourselves and do whatever they ask. We\u2019re in their territory, after-all. It started out good; they had enough food to go around, we joined them for dinner in their halls and there used to be pigs out in the fields. And then, it changed. They reduced our food supply and gave us small jobs to help out. We\u2019re doing it for Jenny, mostly, otherwise we would have tried to leave. One of our group members, David, left a few days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey let him go?\u201d you gasped, trying not to sound too unconvinced that he made it away. But, as expected, Namjoon nodded, thinking purely of the situation. You wondered if it was an act, a coping mechanism. The look of life and hope in his eyes made you feel somehow guilty. </p><p>\u201cThey asked us if we wanted to leave a few days after the food began running out. David was the only one to pick up and head out.\u201d</p><p><i>Why didn\u2019t you leave?</i></p><p>In reply, however, you said nothing. Nothing seemed like the right thing to say in that moment. Seeing someone so hopeful for the world to change made you feel at ease, almost comfortable in the new and unfamiliar setting. After petting Leo, you stood, turning around to head back towards the entrance to the barn. Daniel hurried past you on your way out, a smile on his face, hair now tied into a bobble above his forehead. Taehyung stood alone, now, outside, watching Daniel leave with a smile.</p><p>\u201cMaking friends?\u201d you asked, referencing Daniel.</p><p>Taehyung nodded with a hum. \u201cI love kids.\u201d</p><p>Meeting by his side, you stood in silence, both looking out towards the giant building you walked out of. It looked bigger on the outside- a giant bricked building, with modern windows and a slightly falling apart roof, but intimidating in size and length. It seemed never-ending.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung,\u201d you started, your voice quiet so that Namjoon or anybody else wouldn\u2019t hear, \u201cI <i>really</i> don\u2019t like this place. I don\u2019t think we should stay.\u201d</p><p>He looked over at you with a frown. \u201cYou heard what he said. They\u2019ve been here weeks and still haven\u2019t left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like that,\u201d you insisted, shaking your head. \u201cI\u2019ve seen <i>thousands</i> of movies like this one, Taehyung. I\u2019m telling you- this is <i>exactly</i> what happened in Season 4 of the <i>The Walking Dead</i>. They get to the safe place and then suddenly find out that the people they\u2019re staying with are <i>cannibals</i>-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being paranoid.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>No</i>,\u201d you reasoned, looking at his face, \u201cI\u2019m being realistic, <i>as usual</i>. Look, it\u2019s your call. If you wanna stay\u2026we will. I\u2019m just putting it out there. Something doesn\u2019t feel right about this place.\u201d</p><p>Even though he sighed, Taehyung said nothing; instead, he nodded, patting your shoulder comfortingly. He continued to stare out towards the building, and his mouth dropped to a circle when he noticed two groupies heading in your direction, accompanied by a larger, more plump woman. He pointed it out silently, nudging your shoulder, and as you looked up, you recognised the same woman from earlier, and a shooter that Taehyung seemed to recognise as he jolted in discomfort by your side.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019ve found the barn!\u201d a voice nobody recognised called from across the lot. The larger woman came into view, the sun bouncing off her skin, a natural highlight made from sweat and grease blinding you as she got closer. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Rose. You must be the two newcomers everybody\u2019s talking about.\u201d</p><p>She looked at you specifically, \u201cit\u2019s good to hear you\u2019re back on your feet. I heard from Snowdon here that you were passed out when you arrived. How do you feel?\u201d</p><p>You squirmed. \u201cI\u2019m okay. I was just thirsty. I appreciate the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what,\u201d Rose started, her voice elevated in pitch as she turned to address Snowdon, the female member you barely knew, \u201cI think we should run some tests on this young lady. Make sure that nothing is wrong. Just for safety precautions, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, oh no,\u201d you replied, perhaps a bit too quickly for everybody looked at you with alarm. Rose raised her eyebrows subtly, and Snowdon paused in movement entirely, \u201cI\u2019m fine. Really. I don\u2019t think you need to take any tests. I feel great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019re sure,\u201d Rose said in reply. She looked silently at the two members behind her and they turned without further word. \u201cI just wanted to let you know that you\u2019re perfectly welcome to stay here for as long as you need. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t let you leave just yet, at least not until we know it\u2019s safe to reopen the gates. Until then, you\u2019re welcome to stay in the barn with the others. Dinner is usually at around sundown, sometimes it\u2019s earlier depending on the weather.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung, now slightly uncomfortable, nodded stiffly. \u201cWe won\u2019t be of any trouble. As soon as it\u2019s clear, we\u2019d like to head out. We\u2019re with a group, but we got separated. We\u2019re on our way to them, now. We can\u2019t be late.\u201d</p><p>Rose smiled, her face like plastic. She reminded you of a robot. \u201cI <i>do</i> hope it\u2019s doable.\u201d</p><p>The sound of Rose\u2019s voice must have alerted the others further in the barn, as the sound of footsteps made you look away from the woman and back towards the entrance, where several people you only saw from a distance came out, tanned and burnt, parched and weak. Daniel bounded forward with childlike interest, meanwhile a woman who looked like his mother, or something similar, tumbled after him.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d the woman said meekly, her voice quiet in comparison to Rose\u2019s challenging authority. \u201cI was wondering if Jenny was alright? We haven\u2019t heard from her in weeks. Is she okay? Is it possible to see her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Mommy?\u201d Daniel asked, innocent and oblivious to the world. Rose continued to smile.</p><p>\u201cI can arrange you to see her,\u201d she suggested. \u201cOnly two of you, though. The others do not take so kindly to strangers. I can allow you and the little one access to see her.\u201d She reached for a walkie-talkie burrowed in her pockets, \u201cNevis, please come out to the barn. The little one and his friend request to see the patient in Room 16. Show them the way.\u201d</p><p>At that, Namjoon came out, shielding the sun from his eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarely,\u201d Rose nodded. She seemed to not care for Namjoon, and turned back to Taehyung suddenly: \u201cforgive me for seeming so\u2026brash, but I must ask if you have any weapons. It\u2019s against the rules.\u201d</p><p>You fought all urge to give away Taehyung\u2019s pistol tucked in the back of his jeans. If she knew that there was a weapon there, she didn\u2019t show it. Taehyung shook his head and folded his arms. </p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he lied smoothly. \u201cWe ran out of ammo before we got here, and when Y/N fell, I couldn\u2019t carry everything. I dropped most of the stuff along the way. The guards took the bat and the rifle. I have nothing else.\u201d</p><p>Rose hummed quietly. \u201cVery well.\u201d Nevis joined her side, the same man as before. He had removed his mask, revealing a gruesome scar across his cheek, a hollowness under his cheekbones. He remained emotionless as Rose showed him Daniel and the woman, and without question, he led them towards the building. </p><p>Watching as Rose followed, the group left behind at the barn remained quiet in return. The group went back inside, and Namjoon joined by your side as the shutter to the building closed with privacy, separating the barn and the rest of the camp entirely. It seemed to be quieter, then, without the whir of machinery and occasional scream, which you guessed was either from outside the camp or the cannibalistic lair you were putting money on existing.</p><p>\u201cI know you have a gun at the back of your jeans,\u201d Namjoon said simply, looking at neither you or Taehyung but straight ahead. \u201cLet\u2019s hope nobody finds it.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung gulped. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Namjoon looked over then, and it felt weird not seeing a smile on his face. For the first time since you had met him, he looked serious.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t say anything,\u201d he said honestly. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s <i>any</i> consolation- I don\u2019t trust them either. I just do and say what I have to to make it easier to stay.\u201d</p><hr><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://gwoongi.tumblr.com/post/184083185491/%F0%9D%97%8D%F0%9D%97%81%F0%9D%96%BE-%F0%9D%97%85%F0%9D%96%BA%F0%9D%97%8C%F0%9D%97%8D-%F0%9D%97%88%F0%9D%96%BF-%F0%9D%97%8E%F0%9D%97%8C-taehyung-4\">NEXT CHAPTER.</a></p></blockquote></p>",

Since leaving the car on the side of the road in the middle of Oklahoma, it had been just Taehyung and yourself, walking the open road, deprived of water and a place to sleep. It was impossible to tell where you were now, walking like biters yourselves, staggering across the dusty roads.</p><p>Waking to the sound of refreshing birdsong, you squinted in the tawny sunlight. Rolling your head to your shoulder, your gaze landed on Taehyung crouched before you, the back of his hand pressed against your forehead worriedly, a frown etched to his lips. </p><p>You yawned, and he moved away his hand. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a fever.&rdquo;</p><p>A shaky laugh left your lips. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t that funny.&rdquo;</p><p>His boots shifted on the gravel of the floor inside the multi storey car-park, your back leaned against the graffiti covered wall. A halo above your head in yellow spray-paint, Taehyung figured you looked pretty despite looking as you&rsquo;d expect in an apocalypse. Though, he didn&rsquo;t bet that he looked any better. </p><p>&ldquo;Tired?&rdquo; he asked, cocking his head to look at you as he zipped up his backpack. </p><p>&ldquo;My legs hurt,&rdquo; you admitted quietly, voice hoarse. &ldquo;Thirsty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; Taehyung muttered, stroking hairs away from your damp forehead. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find somewhere to stay, I promise, and I&rsquo;ll find us something to drink. Just&hellip;don&rsquo;t close your eyes, okay? Try and stay awake for me, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>Keeping your eyes open as he helped lift you off the floor felt like the most impossible thing in an impossible world. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna die from dehydration. Isn&rsquo;t that hilarious?&rdquo;</p><p>He grunted, supporting your weight. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford to think like that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;m gonna die on you,&rdquo; you continued, attempting to walk without his help. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the leader and I&rsquo;ve led you to death.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think like that,&rdquo; Taehyung replied, out of breath slightly as he carried himself and your weight down a short flight of stairs. Despite being your companion crossing the country, he wasn&rsquo;t sure if he was comfortable enough calling you a friend, yet. There was a tension, an unspoken thing between the two of you - a refusal to get to know each other, but an urge to know everything at once. Taehyung never asked questions, feeling he wasn&rsquo;t close enough to get the answers. Still, same as before, he needed you to survive, and you needed him, now more than ever. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t let it guilt you. Stop talking, it&rsquo;s gonna wear you out. Just stay quiet and keep walking, okay? I&rsquo;m right here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the worst leader.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nu-huh. You&rsquo;re the best leader, okay? You&rsquo;ve got us so far. Don&rsquo;t give up now, come on.&rdquo;</p><p>Heaving himself forwards through the closed iron door, a flood of light made you grimace with a loud hiss, bringing your sleeve to cover your eyes as Taehyung carried you across the length of the car-park. Occasionally he would stumble, jumping you back up straight with an arm around his shoulders, your legs giving away and dragging like a doll across the concrete. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, <i>hey</i>, stay awake, okay?&rdquo; Taehyung said, his voice more frantic now, as he crouched his head to look at your face closer. The sweat had opened up your pores, and your dark circles were even more prominent as a feature of your face. He didn&rsquo;t mind. &ldquo;Eyes on me, Y/N. Can you hear me?&rdquo;</p><p>An incoherent grumble was good enough and he cursed softly, walking quicker across the park, his breaths laboured and a line of sweat building up at his hairline, his fringe sticking like mixture to a bowl to his forehead. Each step was followed with a breathless, &ldquo;<i>please</i>,&rdquo;, his fingers tightening on your skin, his heart physically hurting at the thought of letting you down&hellip;just a bit further, now. Just a little bit further-</p><p>Losing his steps, stumbling over his own feet as you hung limp by his side, Taehyung let you fall to the ground with a soft exhale of breath, your hair spilling out like a halo around your head. The sun was hot on his skin as he bent over you, checking for a pulse, relieved when he found it. By now, you were unresponsive. </p><p>He was panicked- his hands trembled as he cradled your face in his hands, calling you back to him, searching for a response in your face. Never before had he felt so afraid at the thought of being alone in this world, alone without a companion- without a possible friend. <i>Without you</i>.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Stop right there!&rdquo;</i></p><p>Hands still cradling your face, Taehyung looked up immediately, his eyes squinting in the midday sunlight. In a few seconds, they focused on a dark silhouette standing on top of a barricaded storage container, painted a navy blue with the words, &ldquo;<i><small>WILL SHOOT ON SIGHT!</small></i>&rdquo; sprayed on. Clearly he hadn&rsquo;t noticed that. He was mostly thankful they hadn&rsquo;t shot on sight. The figure did not move, standing still with their gun pointed in his direction. Without looking, too, Taehyung could sense about three other bandits pointing guns at him, masks pulled up over their faces, caps covering eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Please-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you infected?&rdquo; the same voice called, gruff and loud. A shooter nearby shot down an approaching biter, slow in movement but regardless, still a threat. </p><p>&ldquo;What? <i>No</i>, we-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is she bit?&rdquo; the voice repeated, pointing the gun at your body laying on the floor, sweat pooling by your arms. Taehyung looked down at you worriedly and then looked back up.</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he was confident.</p><p>The figure lowered their gun for a moment. &ldquo;Is she <i>dead</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Taehyung replied without a second of breath. &ldquo;<i>No</i>! We&rsquo;ve been walking for days and we ran out of water. She&rsquo;s dehydrated.&rdquo;</p><p>A second shooter scurried across the top of the container. &ldquo;The girl&rsquo;s down. Not a threat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anybody who&rsquo;s not <i>us</i> is a threat.&rdquo;</p><p>The second shooter frowned behind the mask. &ldquo;Give them the water. They ain&rsquo;t a threat to us yet. You&rsquo;d want them to do the same.&rdquo;</p><p>Although he seemed irritated, the first figure lowered his gun and pushed past the female shooter, hopping down from the container onto the floor. The girl remained indifferent, glancing at Taehyung in the middle of the street. Wordless, she waved her hand and the containers swiftly shifted, as if on cue, revealing a gate into a cluttered road, decorated with newspapers and large crates with, &ldquo;<small><i>NORTHGATE</i></small>&rdquo; engraved on them. Taehyung let out a sigh of immense relief, shifting to collect you in his arms, and without objection, moved towards the gates.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aa19131eb99b8342666d76442acab505/tumblr_inline_pp4mh8uJ7Q1vmnd3l_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><blockquote><p><b>NEW YORK CITY, DECEMBER, 3 YEARS AGO.<br />2 WEEKS BEFORE THE OUTBREAK.</b></p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;What a way to spend Christmas.&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung had never spent a Christmas away from his family.&nbsp;Of course, with his sister being a second year student at NYU, she was breezing through her second Christmas away with ease. To the corner of her dorm room, a Christmas tree shedding bristles stood at an angle, with ugly decorations and a sponge at the top acting as the star- &ldquo;Christmas on a budget,&rdquo; she said when he mentioned it, and he laughed. In a room further down the hall, her roommates finished wrapping their gifts to give out in three days time, and Taehyung, amongst the sound of carols, focused his attention on the thickening pile of snow on the windowpane outside, the frost glued to the glass in web decorations.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me about it,&rdquo; Taehyung replied animatedly, turning his attention to his sister who sat down on the circle carpet in front of him. She wore a bright green jumper decorated in gingham and flashing bulbs sewn into the wool, and plain black leggings with fluffy red and white socks. On her hair, a set of reindeer ears finished her look, meanwhile Taehyung settled with a similar jumper and bare feet, numbed by the fire. </p><p>His sister&rsquo;s dorm sufficed as home. For now, at least.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe we can&rsquo;t make it home this year,&rdquo; she continued, dunking a Custard Cream into her hot chocolate. &ldquo;You think they&rsquo;re okay back home?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford to think any different,&rdquo; Taehyung replied, trying to remain optimistic. But with upper-New York in quarantine, and evacuations running almost daily, he was finding it harder to hang onto hope. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll catch a flight when the airlines are back open. Knowing Dad, he&rsquo;s probably taken them all to Grandma&rsquo;s place. For comfort, and safety, while the raids finish. Did you hear about the riots in Detroit the other day?&rdquo;</p><p>She nodded. &ldquo;Scary stuff. I did some research before the internet shut down in the dorms, and it doesn&rsquo;t look as extreme in Korea. I mean, the President was assassinated and there&rsquo;s currently no stable Government, but, aside from that, everything seemed to be in working order. <i>Daegu</i> was fine, at least. I didn&rsquo;t look anywhere else.&rdquo;</p><p>At that, Mandy, a second roommate, stepped out from the thin corridor. &ldquo;I heard England was the same. Brits executed their prime-minister a few nights ago. There was articles about them wanting to have Tom Hiddleston as the leader of the UK, which, to be honest, sounds pretty good. I&rsquo;d go visit.&rdquo;</p><p>Laughing, his sister thought nothing of it. She turned to Taehyung with a gentle gaze, not enough to cause panic, but enough to send a message without words. </p><p>&ldquo;Did your friends leave campus already?&rdquo; Mandy asked Taehyung, switching on the kettle. The TV fizzled to a static and she frowned, &ldquo;<i>great</i>. Looks like the power&rsquo;s cutting out too. Is it this bad in the Halls?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We still have internet. And, a <i>few</i> left campus. I think Zac is still in the dorms, though. He hasn&rsquo;t left in a couple of days. He said he wasn&rsquo;t feeling well. Figures he got sick from walking past the quarantine zone. I didn&rsquo;t wanna take chances so I haven&rsquo;t been there in a couple days.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe you should stay here for the night,&rdquo; Mandy offered kindly, sipping her freshly brewed tea. &ldquo;I mean, until the storm has thawed. If Zac is sick, we don&rsquo;t want you to catch it. We can drop by on the way to the student store in the morning and get your things. I don&rsquo;t think the airlines are gonna reopen anytime soon, and subways were closed months ago, and I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll catch a ride on the bus in this weather. We&rsquo;ll have to hole up in here until the military says it&rsquo;s safe to leave.&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung accepted, taking a blanket from Mandy after she hurried to their storage closet to fish one out, with pillows spare for the couch, a new makeshift bed in front of the roaring fire. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be together if anything bad happens,&rdquo; his sister said, in a whisper, minutes before mandatory curfew at 9pm. &ldquo;Promise?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Taehyung replied, his hand gripping her own. &ldquo;I promise&hellip;&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p><b>PRESENT DAY. <small><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMjviNT8ssY\">[x]</a></small></b></p></blockquote><p>At the sound of bed sheets rustling, Taehyung jolted awake. Unable to differentiate the past and the present, Taehyung opened his eyes expecting to see the fireplace, and the Christmas tree, and his sister on the circle rug. Instead, he noticed an unfamiliar room, drowned in a desert-beige, the light peeping in from a rectangular barred window. </p><p>He dragged the chair he had fallen asleep on closer to the army bed you were lying on, the noise as grating as the sound of chalk on a blackboard. Checking for injuries, his hands smoothed away strands of hair from your face, the trembling anxiety faded but still present if he really concentrated. </p><p>With a groan, you tried to sit up, but his hands came to your shoulders and settled you back on the canvas sheets. &ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How are you feeling?&rdquo; he asked, avoiding the question.</p><p>You pondered the question- &ldquo;stiff. But I&rsquo;m okay. What is this place?&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung looked over his shoulder at the empty room. &ldquo;You were passed out on the road when they found us. We were headed for their camp and they stopped me for questioning. They let us in, gave you water, let you rest.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; your voice said, scratchy. By the headboard of the small, iron bed, Taehyung reached for a glass of warming water, handing it to you quickly. &ldquo;Thankyou.&rdquo; You swallowed half the water. &ldquo;Are we staying here?&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung looked hesitant, taking a sip from the almost empty cup and setting it back down on the table. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if we can trust these people. At the very least, we&rsquo;ll stay for the night. They could give us some supplies to leave. I&rsquo;m already running low on ammo, and we have nothing left to eat. I don&rsquo;t think we have any other choice <i>but</i> to stay.&rdquo;</p><p>You knew that there was no other way. Despite his efforts to keep you down, you shuffled back up off the bed, your back leaning with a heavy thud against the drywall. Taehyung pushed back on his chair, his hands knitted together anxiously as he watched you grimace, and scratch your throat absentmindedly.</p><p>&ldquo;How long have we been here?&rdquo; you asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Not long,&rdquo; Taehyung said quietly, looking the window to see the falling sunlight change angles. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a couple hours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are they at least <i>nice</i>? Does the camp look secure?&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung opened his mouth, but paused, trying to find the right words. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a camp. It&rsquo;s more like, a street. A small little community of really <i>angry</i> people. I didn&rsquo;t get to look around much, but I overheard one of the shooters saying that there was another small group of survivors outside near the farm. But, from what I heard, I think we got lucky being let inside.&rdquo;</p><p>Having nothing of value to say in reply, you simply stayed quiet. Picking the skin around your nails, Taehyung shuffled back on the chair and pulled it to the wall with the window, standing on the plastic and peeking outside. The window was on the ground, meaning you weren&rsquo;t, and he gulped at the sight of jeep wheels driving past, and black boots, similar to the military. It reminded him of New York, and the night before the bombing of the quarantine near NYU. He cringed and moved away, placing the chair back near the bed and hovering nearby, debating whether to sit or stand.</p><p>&ldquo;You talk in your sleep, too,&rdquo; you said quietly, meeting his gaze as it fluttered up from beneath his overgrown fringe. He offered a lopsided smile, curious yet nervous all at once. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah? Must have picked it up from you.&rdquo; Instead of the chair, he sat on the bed. &ldquo;Did I say anything funny?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. Most of it was mumbles,&rdquo; you replied, smiling up at him. </p><p>Taehyung laughed through his nose, his face downcast and fingers twiddling in his lap. &ldquo;Ah, pity. I wish we still had cameras, you could have filmed it for fun.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wish I still had my camera, so I could look back on my life before now,&rdquo; you answered, after a short delay of silence. &ldquo;Remind myself of people&rsquo;s faces. Manipulate myself into thinking this is all a dream.&rdquo;</p><p>Without really thinking, Taehyung reached to grip your hand. These days, he hasn&rsquo;t really thought at all. You looked up at him, comforted at the way his hand felt on your own, smoothing circles into the skin of your knuckles, exploring the lines on your palm, fingering each separation. Oh, how beautiful it was, to find comfort in the presence of someone you barely knew, but trusted entirely. </p><p>&ldquo;This won&rsquo;t be forever, Y/N,&rdquo; he said, with such a sincere and genuine voice that you felt your stomach knot and churn, a lump forming in your throat. Suddenly you need another drink of water. &ldquo;You <i>won&rsquo;t</i> be sad forever.&rdquo;</p><p>Before you could reply, the door swung open, and his hands moved from your own back to his lap. He rose, too, reaching for the back of his jeans, gripping the pistol tucked inside. </p><p>The same female shooter from the container entered, her rifle swung over her shoulder, skin sweaty and tanned from the camo tank-top she wore underneath her black jacket, discarded somewhere. Taehyung remembered the details. </p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s awake, then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; you replied bluntly, polite enough to suffice as gratefulness. &ldquo;Thank you. For letting us in.&rdquo;</p><p>The woman sighed, her shoulders sagging in the movement. &ldquo;Well, no need to thank me yet. It&rsquo;s still being cleared with the boss. Rules are rules. Feeling better, at least?&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded slightly, staring at Taehyung as he chose to speak for you. &ldquo;Can we leave this room, yet? It&rsquo;s stuffy, and I think she&rsquo;d like to walk for a while, isn&rsquo;t that right, Y/N?&rdquo;</p><p>He stared at you, sending messages without words. You nodded again, &ldquo;please.&rdquo;</p><p>Rolling her shoulders, the woman stepped to the side, leaving space for you to both walk out. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make yourself too at home, but you&rsquo;re free to look around. Inside this building is restricted to outsiders, but the outside near the farm is free. There&rsquo;s another group of survivors nearby- they&rsquo;re cranky and hostile, but, they had children. We <i>never</i> refuse kids.&rdquo;</p><p>Already, you were learning little things about this place. To be truthful, you didn&rsquo;t even know what to call where you were- were they captors? Saviours? Enemies? You hesitated to jump to conclusions, instead moving to follow Taehyung out of the confined room with a curt nod and no words. The woman didn&rsquo;t seem to mind; she slammed the door shut behind her and pointed her gun in the direction of a raised shutter, leading out to the luscious-looking farmland out back. She didn&rsquo;t follow. She took off in a different direction, signalling to her group with words neither you or Taehyung could understand.</p><p>&ldquo;I have a <i>really</i> bad feeling about this place,&rdquo; you admitted in a low voice, sticking to Taehyung&rsquo;s side like glue. The faint smell of sweat and grime that would have repelled you now comforted you instead, and without wanting to come across as unnecessarily clingy, you gently held onto the back of his shirt, letting him lead you out into the scorching sunlight. </p><p>&ldquo;Hopefully,&rdquo; he began, setting off towards the red and white barn pushed towards the corner of the premises, &ldquo;we won&rsquo;t be here long. As soon as we&rsquo;re clear to leave, we will.&rdquo;</p><p>Realistically, Taehyung knew what happened to newcomers who joined groups where everything felt perfect. Nothing was ever truly perfect, he thought, especially so in a post-apocalyptic world where dead people were coming to life to eat people. Taehyung had seen the movies, bought the T-shirt, played the game- he <i>knew</i> what happened. However, he hoped humanity had changed. He was willing to give this place a chance. If he wanted to survive another night, he&rsquo;d have to.</p><p>The barn was ordinary looking, painted a brick red with white outlines, the picture-perfect barn that every farm had on TV. Surrounding the barn, a field of dead crops created a barren landscape that everybody felt familiar with, the weather not being right to grow crops. Approaching the barn, Taehyung paused when he noticed a young child running out, chased playfully by a Saint Bernard whose pants were louder than birdsong. </p><p>It had been a long time since he had seen a child. Or a dog.</p><p>He headed towards the barn, smiling affectionately when the little boy looked over with curiosity, his eyes widening in surprise and fright and he yelped in alarm, running back inside the barn. Taehyung hesitated, making you stiffen behind him as the dog growled in your direction, only halting when a man came out of the barn with the child cowering behind his leg. He didn&rsquo;t look old enough to be a father, but a lot had happened since the outbreak. The man smiled nonetheless, his smile being nothing but warm and inviting. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, look, it&rsquo;s the newbies.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Newbies</i>?&rdquo; you mocked without thinking. Although Taehyung gave you a look of mild disappointment, the man did not deter, in-fact he laughed and placed his hands on his hips.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to see new faces,&rdquo; he said earnestly. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t bring in new people often. Welcome.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Taehyung. This is Y/N, we won&rsquo;t be here long,&rdquo; Taehyung promised, stretching out a hand and shaking the man&rsquo;s. The man laughed shortly, constantly smiling. His energy was like a breath of fresh air, almost enough to convince you that everything was normal. </p><p>&ldquo;Namjoon. This here is Daniel. Not mine, of course. There&rsquo;s a couple others in the back of the barn,&rdquo; the man- <i>Namjoon</i>- replied. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t place your money on getting out of this place so easily. We&rsquo;ve been here for a few weeks now. We planned to stay for three nights until Jenny&rsquo;s fever levelled out. They took her in for testing. Said she&rsquo;s in care, but we haven&rsquo;t seen her since then.&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung moved to greet Daniel, crouching to his level. Meanwhile you stared blankly at Namjoon, an expression of doubt and question on your features. He noticed, but didn&rsquo;t comment.</p><p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t let you visit?&rdquo; you repeated. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>Namjoon shrugged, nodding for you to follow him into the barn. &ldquo;Apparently their main building is off-limits to outsiders. A lot of them in here think she&rsquo;s dead already. But, it&rsquo;s nice to keep holding onto hope.&rdquo;</p><p>Without approaching too closely, you made note of the six people in Namjoon&rsquo;s group, not including himself and Daniel, who was still outside with Taehyung, giggling innocently. What they lacked in looks they made up for in numbers- you hadn&rsquo;t seen a group look so wrecked in such pristine conditions. Namjoon had turned away, taking a seat on a bale of hay, stroking the Saint Bernard behind his ears lovingly. </p><p>&ldquo;What is this place?&rdquo; you asked, inching towards the dog whose tag read Leo. </p><p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t really tell us anything since we&rsquo;re outsiders,&rdquo; Namjoon began, occasionally looking up to make sure you were listening. He did that a lot. &ldquo;But, a lot of their crates say Northgate. Nate says it&rsquo;s a military name, but we obviously can&rsquo;t prove that from in here, can we?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is it&hellip;<i>safe</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>Namjoon hesitated. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. The <i>barn</i> is secure. I don&rsquo;t know much about the actual camp. We mostly stick to ourselves and do whatever they ask. We&rsquo;re in their territory, after-all. It started out good; they had enough food to go around, we joined them for dinner in their halls and there used to be pigs out in the fields. And then, it changed. They reduced our food supply and gave us small jobs to help out. We&rsquo;re doing it for Jenny, mostly, otherwise we would have tried to leave. One of our group members, David, left a few days ago.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They let him go?&rdquo; you gasped, trying not to sound too unconvinced that he made it away. But, as expected, Namjoon nodded, thinking purely of the situation. You wondered if it was an act, a coping mechanism. The look of life and hope in his eyes made you feel somehow guilty. </p><p>&ldquo;They asked us if we wanted to leave a few days after the food began running out. David was the only one to pick up and head out.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Why didn&rsquo;t you leave?</i></p><p>In reply, however, you said nothing. Nothing seemed like the right thing to say in that moment. Seeing someone so hopeful for the world to change made you feel at ease, almost comfortable in the new and unfamiliar setting. After petting Leo, you stood, turning around to head back towards the entrance to the barn. Daniel hurried past you on your way out, a smile on his face, hair now tied into a bobble above his forehead. Taehyung stood alone, now, outside, watching Daniel leave with a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Making friends?&rdquo; you asked, referencing Daniel.</p><p>Taehyung nodded with a hum. &ldquo;I love kids.&rdquo;</p><p>Meeting by his side, you stood in silence, both looking out towards the giant building you walked out of. It looked bigger on the outside- a giant bricked building, with modern windows and a slightly falling apart roof, but intimidating in size and length. It seemed never-ending.</p><p>&ldquo;Taehyung,&rdquo; you started, your voice quiet so that Namjoon or anybody else wouldn&rsquo;t hear, &ldquo;I <i>really</i> don&rsquo;t like this place. I don&rsquo;t think we should stay.&rdquo;</p><p>He looked over at you with a frown. &ldquo;You heard what he said. They&rsquo;ve been here weeks and still haven&rsquo;t left.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that,&rdquo; you insisted, shaking your head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen <i>thousands</i> of movies like this one, Taehyung. I&rsquo;m telling you- this is <i>exactly</i> what happened in Season 4 of the <i>The Walking Dead</i>. They get to the safe place and then suddenly find out that the people they&rsquo;re staying with are <i>cannibals</i>-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re being paranoid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>No</i>,&rdquo; you reasoned, looking at his face, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m being realistic, <i>as usual</i>. Look, it&rsquo;s your call. If you wanna stay&hellip;we will. I&rsquo;m just putting it out there. Something doesn&rsquo;t feel right about this place.&rdquo;</p><p>Even though he sighed, Taehyung said nothing; instead, he nodded, patting your shoulder comfortingly. He continued to stare out towards the building, and his mouth dropped to a circle when he noticed two groupies heading in your direction, accompanied by a larger, more plump woman. He pointed it out silently, nudging your shoulder, and as you looked up, you recognised the same woman from earlier, and a shooter that Taehyung seemed to recognise as he jolted in discomfort by your side.</p><p>&ldquo;I see you&rsquo;ve found the barn!&rdquo; a voice nobody recognised called from across the lot. The larger woman came into view, the sun bouncing off her skin, a natural highlight made from sweat and grease blinding you as she got closer. &ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Rose. You must be the two newcomers everybody&rsquo;s talking about.&rdquo;</p><p>She looked at you specifically, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s good to hear you&rsquo;re back on your feet. I heard from Snowdon here that you were passed out when you arrived. How do you feel?&rdquo;</p><p>You squirmed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay. I was just thirsty. I appreciate the water.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know what,&rdquo; Rose started, her voice elevated in pitch as she turned to address Snowdon, the female member you barely knew, &ldquo;I think we should run some tests on this young lady. Make sure that nothing is wrong. Just for safety precautions, of course.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, oh no,&rdquo; you replied, perhaps a bit too quickly for everybody looked at you with alarm. Rose raised her eyebrows subtly, and Snowdon paused in movement entirely, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. Really. I don&rsquo;t think you need to take any tests. I feel great.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Only if you&rsquo;re sure,&rdquo; Rose said in reply. She looked silently at the two members behind her and they turned without further word. &ldquo;I just wanted to let you know that you&rsquo;re perfectly welcome to stay here for as long as you need. Unfortunately, we can&rsquo;t let you leave just yet, at least not until we know it&rsquo;s safe to reopen the gates. Until then, you&rsquo;re welcome to stay in the barn with the others. Dinner is usually at around sundown, sometimes it&rsquo;s earlier depending on the weather.&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung, now slightly uncomfortable, nodded stiffly. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t be of any trouble. As soon as it&rsquo;s clear, we&rsquo;d like to head out. We&rsquo;re with a group, but we got separated. We&rsquo;re on our way to them, now. We can&rsquo;t be late.&rdquo;</p><p>Rose smiled, her face like plastic. She reminded you of a robot. &ldquo;I <i>do</i> hope it&rsquo;s doable.&rdquo;</p><p>The sound of Rose&rsquo;s voice must have alerted the others further in the barn, as the sound of footsteps made you look away from the woman and back towards the entrance, where several people you only saw from a distance came out, tanned and burnt, parched and weak. Daniel bounded forward with childlike interest, meanwhile a woman who looked like his mother, or something similar, tumbled after him.</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; the woman said meekly, her voice quiet in comparison to Rose&rsquo;s challenging authority. &ldquo;I was wondering if Jenny was alright? We haven&rsquo;t heard from her in weeks. Is she okay? Is it possible to see her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mommy?&rdquo; Daniel asked, innocent and oblivious to the world. Rose continued to smile.</p><p>&ldquo;I can arrange you to see her,&rdquo; she suggested. &ldquo;Only two of you, though. The others do not take so kindly to strangers. I can allow you and the little one access to see her.&rdquo; She reached for a walkie-talkie burrowed in her pockets, &ldquo;Nevis, please come out to the barn. The little one and his friend request to see the patient in Room 16. Show them the way.&rdquo;</p><p>At that, Namjoon came out, shielding the sun from his eyes. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Barely,&rdquo; Rose nodded. She seemed to not care for Namjoon, and turned back to Taehyung suddenly: &ldquo;forgive me for seeming so&hellip;brash, but I must ask if you have any weapons. It&rsquo;s against the rules.&rdquo;</p><p>You fought all urge to give away Taehyung&rsquo;s pistol tucked in the back of his jeans. If she knew that there was a weapon there, she didn&rsquo;t show it. Taehyung shook his head and folded his arms. </p><p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he lied smoothly. &ldquo;We ran out of ammo before we got here, and when Y/N fell, I couldn&rsquo;t carry everything. I dropped most of the stuff along the way. The guards took the bat and the rifle. I have nothing else.&rdquo;</p><p>Rose hummed quietly. &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; Nevis joined her side, the same man as before. He had removed his mask, revealing a gruesome scar across his cheek, a hollowness under his cheekbones. He remained emotionless as Rose showed him Daniel and the woman, and without question, he led them towards the building. </p><p>Watching as Rose followed, the group left behind at the barn remained quiet in return. The group went back inside, and Namjoon joined by your side as the shutter to the building closed with privacy, separating the barn and the rest of the camp entirely. It seemed to be quieter, then, without the whir of machinery and occasional scream, which you guessed was either from outside the camp or the cannibalistic lair you were putting money on existing.</p><p>&ldquo;I know you have a gun at the back of your jeans,&rdquo; Namjoon said simply, looking at neither you or Taehyung but straight ahead. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope nobody finds it.&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung gulped. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>Namjoon looked over then, and it felt weird not seeing a smile on his face. For the first time since you had met him, he looked serious.</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say anything,&rdquo; he said honestly. &ldquo;And if it&rsquo;s <i>any</i> consolation- I don&rsquo;t trust them either. I just do and say what I have to to make it easier to stay.&rdquo;</p><hr /><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://gwoongi.tumblr.com/post/184083185491/%F0%9D%97%8D%F0%9D%97%81%F0%9D%96%BE-%F0%9D%97%85%F0%9D%96%BA%F0%9D%97%8C%F0%9D%97%8D-%F0%9D%97%88%F0%9D%96%BF-%F0%9D%97%8E%F0%9D%97%8C-taehyung-4\">NEXT CHAPTER.</a></p></blockquote></p>",

Since leaving the car on the side of the road in the middle of Oklahoma, it had been just Taehyung and yourself, walking the open road, deprived of water and a place to sleep. It was impossible to tell where you were now, walking like biters yourselves, staggering across the dusty roads.</p>\n<p>Waking to the sound of refreshing birdsong, you squinted in the tawny sunlight. Rolling your head to your shoulder, your gaze landed on Taehyung crouched before you, the back of his hand pressed against your forehead worriedly, a frown etched to his lips. </p>\n<p>You yawned, and he moved away his hand. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a fever.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A shaky laugh left your lips. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t that funny.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>His boots shifted on the gravel of the floor inside the multi storey car-park, your back leaned against the graffiti covered wall. A halo above your head in yellow spray-paint, Taehyung figured you looked pretty despite looking as you&rsquo;d expect in an apocalypse. Though, he didn&rsquo;t bet that he looked any better. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Tired?&rdquo; he asked, cocking his head to look at you as he zipped up his backpack. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;My legs hurt,&rdquo; you admitted quietly, voice hoarse. &ldquo;Thirsty.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; Taehyung muttered, stroking hairs away from your damp forehead. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find somewhere to stay, I promise, and I&rsquo;ll find us something to drink. Just&hellip;don&rsquo;t close your eyes, okay? Try and stay awake for me, okay?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Keeping your eyes open as he helped lift you off the floor felt like the most impossible thing in an impossible world. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna die from dehydration. Isn&rsquo;t that hilarious?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He grunted, supporting your weight. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford to think like that.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;m gonna die on you,&rdquo; you continued, attempting to walk without his help. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the leader and I&rsquo;ve led you to death.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think like that,&rdquo; Taehyung replied, out of breath slightly as he carried himself and your weight down a short flight of stairs. Despite being your companion crossing the country, he wasn&rsquo;t sure if he was comfortable enough calling you a friend, yet. There was a tension, an unspoken thing between the two of you - a refusal to get to know each other, but an urge to know everything at once. Taehyung never asked questions, feeling he wasn&rsquo;t close enough to get the answers. Still, same as before, he needed you to survive, and you needed him, now more than ever. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t let it guilt you. Stop talking, it&rsquo;s gonna wear you out. Just stay quiet and keep walking, okay? I&rsquo;m right here.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the worst leader.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Nu-huh. You&rsquo;re the best leader, okay? You&rsquo;ve got us so far. Don&rsquo;t give up now, come on.&rdquo;</p>\n</p>",

Voc\u00eas j\u00e1 tinham ficado e sa\u00eddo algumas vezes, mas nada mais que isso. Voc\u00ea sabia que ele te via como um mero &ldquo;passatempo&rdquo;, apesar disso te magoar muito, ainda sim sa\u00eda com ele, pois era a \u00fanica forma de ficarem juntos, mesmo que fosse apenas por interesse &ldquo;a mais&rdquo;.</p><p>Jin tinha sumido por uns dias, e do nada reapareceu com uma &ldquo;namorada&rdquo;, que era impec\u00e1vel, era a garota ideal no olhar do mais velho. Ap\u00f3s isso ele mal falava com voc\u00ea ou te respondia, agia como um verdadeiro babaca. Algum tempo depois, voc\u00ea conheceu novas pessoas, novos sabores, novas bocas e novas oportunidades, e obviamente n\u00e3o perdeu tempo. </p><p>Passou um tempo, e voc\u00ea soube que a tal namorada de Jin tinha terminado com ele, ela s\u00f3 queria uma vida boa ao lado de um trouxa, e arrumou Jin. Depois que conseguiu tudo que queria, largou o garoto triste e de cora\u00e7\u00e3o partido. Ap\u00f3s isso, Jin milagrosamente lembrou da sua exist\u00eancia e come\u00e7ou a mandar mensagens e pedindo perd\u00e3o, pena que ja era tarde demais.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Eu sei que fui muito babaca com voc\u00ea, e me arrependo muito, muito mesmo. Eu me sinto um lixo por ter recusado seus sentimentos reais e ter aceitado os falsos, se eu pudesse voltar no tempo, escolheria voc\u00ea, e faria de tudo pra ser pelo menos a metade do que merece.&rdquo;</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"350\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/70850d9870782ed71b755bd09cbc4d53/tumblr_ppi29pR1Ge1wrzlzc_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"350\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><h2>Yoongi;</h2><p>Yoon, seu namorado, e voc\u00ea estavam passando por uma fase bem complicada. O relacionamento est\u00e1 muito frio e sem gra\u00e7a, n\u00e3o saiam mais, mal se beijavam e muito menos transavam, estava uma cat\u00e1strofe. Voc\u00eas estavam cada vez mais distantes, voc\u00ea tentava se reaproximar do garoto, mas ele n\u00e3o fazia mais quest\u00e3o, as vezes parecia que ele n\u00e3o te amava mais.</p><p>Algum tempo depois, vc comecou a notar que Yoongi estava andando bem felizinho, sorrindo pelos cantos, ficava com cara de bobo apaixonado sempre que ficava no celular, voc\u00ea realmente tentou fingir que isso n\u00e3o lhe partia o cora\u00e7\u00e3o, mas estava cada vez mais imposs\u00edvel. Ent\u00e3o depois de pensar muito, decide conversa com ele e resolver tudo.</p><p>E infelizmente o pior aconteceu, Yoongi estava apaixonado por sua nova amiga de trabalho, e ele admitiu isso pra voc\u00ea, dizendo que n\u00e3o sentia mais nada, e que queria dar um fim a tudo que voc\u00ea tiveram. Voc\u00ea n\u00e3o estava acreditando nisso, ele iria mesmo te trocar, a pessoa que sempre o apoiou e esteve ao lado dele nas horas boas e ruins, por uma garota que mal conhecia? </p><p>Voc\u00ea sem escolha, o deixou partir, afinal, por que ficar ao lado de algu\u00e9m que est\u00e1 apaixonado por um outro algu\u00e9m? Foi a a coisa mais dif\u00edcil, mas foi necess\u00e1rio. Yoongi e a garota come\u00e7aram a se envolver, depois do dia em que ele foi embora, nunca mais te ligou ou mandou mensagens,  estava ocupado demais conquistando a garota nova.</p><p>Por\u00e9m o mundo d\u00e1 voltas, e a garota que ele gostava, n\u00e3o gostava dele, ela j\u00e1 tinha &ldquo;namorado&rdquo;, e n\u00e3o trocaria algo t\u00e3o lindo e puro por algo moment\u00e2neo, o que fez Yoongi cair na real, e se dar conta que tinha desgra\u00e7ado a vida dele de vez. E a dor veio, veio de uma forma t\u00e3o forte e enlouquecedora, olhar para o lado e ver que a melhor coisa que voc\u00ea tinha foi embora - por sua pr\u00f3pria culpa - com toda a certeza \u00e9 algo que ele n\u00e3o desejaria a ningu\u00e9m. Enquanto voc\u00ea se reerguia, ele se afundava ainda mais, seja no \u00e1lcool, tristeza, ou trabalho, ele sempre tentava arranjar um meio de te esquecer, de n\u00e3o ir at\u00e9 sua casa e implorar para ter a sol novamente na vida dele, por que naquele momento so chovia, mas ele deixou para l\u00e1, n\u00e3o queria atrapalhar sua vida, e sabia que voc\u00ea jamais o perdoaria pelo que ele fez, por\u00e9m l\u00e1 no fundo, ele tinha uma esperan\u00e7a de que voc\u00ea o aceitasse novamente.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Eu gostaria de me jogar fora, mas se eu me jogar, quem \u00e9 que vai me pegar de volta? A \u00fanica pessoa que eu tinha, se foi, e eu me culpo por isso, todos os malditos dias, e cada vez doi mais, achei que ia passar, mas n\u00e3o passa&hellip; Eu me arrependo tanto, que nem sei explicar, eu s\u00f3 queria ele de volta, a solid\u00e3o est\u00e1 cada vez me consumindo, meus dias s\u00e3o escuros e frios, volte meu amor&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"511\" data-orig-width=\"650\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4f43dda24d6bdf024923b27c6c045eb5/tumblr_ppi29fWfDb1wrzlzc_1280.gif\" data-orig-height=\"511\" data-orig-width=\"650\"/></figure><h2><span class=\"npf_color_monica\">Hoseok</span>;</h2><p>Voc\u00ea e sua amiga eram afim de Hobi, ambas gostavam de disputar por qual ele se apaixonaria, e que levaria numa boa caso escolhesse uma ou outra, e foi aconteceu. Ele chamou sua amiga para sair e como prometeram, levou isso numa &ldquo;boa&rdquo;, tirando a parte que ficou bem triste, mas torceu por eles.</p><p>Ele come\u00e7aram a namorar, por\u00e9m sua amiga o tra\u00eda com outra garota, e voc\u00ea sabia, por\u00e9m n\u00e3o falou nada porqu\u00ea ela ainda era sua amiga n\u00e9. Por azar de sua amiga, Hoseok descobriu que ela o tra\u00eda e terminou com a garota. Dois dias depois ele te chamou para ir tomar algo. Chegando l\u00e1 ele disse que sabia sobre seus sentimentos, sua amiga tinha o contado sobre voc\u00eas duas estarem gostando dele. E ele disse que sempre te achou uma gracinha, e boa demais para ele, e se perguntava o por qu\u00ea de uma garota t\u00e3o incr\u00edvel estar interessada por ele (??\u00bf\u00bf), e perguntou se voc\u00ea ainda tinha sentimentos por ele, e se tivesse ele faria de tudo para dar certo dessa vez. Por\u00e9m no tempo certo.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Eu sa\u00ed de um relacionamento agora, mas se eu tiver alguma chance, n\u00e3o irei desperdi\u00e7ar, s\u00f3 me d\u00ea um tempo&rdquo;</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/acbeaa5a7887df3ba9378504dbeef8b5/tumblr_ppi29m0y2J1wrzlzc_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"/></figure><h2><span class=\"npf_color_joey\">Namjoon</span>;</h2><p>Seu namorado andava bastante estranho, andava desconfiado quando mexia no celular, n\u00e3o gostava que voc\u00ea fosse o ver no est\u00fadio dele e n\u00e3o deixava nem voc\u00ea triscar no celular dele. Voc\u00ea j\u00e1 suspeitava do que estava rolando, mas foi ver se era verdade mesmo.</p><p>Era 20h30 da noite, e Namjoon como sempre n\u00e3o tinha chegado, e voc\u00ea, preocupada e desconfiada, foi atr\u00e1s do seu namorado, seu cora\u00e7\u00e3o do\u00eda, e seu est\u00f4mago embrulhada a cada passo que se aproximava do pr\u00e9dio da BH. Chegando l\u00e1, subiu as escadas e foi ao estudio do garoto, e antes de bater na porta ouviu um &ldquo;Namjoonn..&rdquo; arrastado, como um gemido, seu cora\u00e7\u00e3o parou e seu est\u00f4mago embrulho tanto que quase te fez vomitar, tentou abrir a porta, mas estava trancada, ent\u00e3o deu batidas fracas e ocas na porta a sua frente. A voz de Namjoon perguntou quem estava do outro lado, e nada foi ouvido, voc\u00ea j\u00e1 chorava, sabia o que estava rolando.</p><p>Poucos segundos a porta se abre a voc\u00ea se depara com um Namjoon suado e com a camisa um pouco desabotoada, e uma mulher limpando os l\u00e1bios vermelhos borrados. Namjoon e a mulher ficaram chocados ao te ver ali, nao esperavam que a corna apareceria para acabar com a festa. Voc\u00ea saiu dali o mais r\u00e1pido poss\u00edvel, e Namjoon continuou est\u00e1tico na porta, sem saber o que fazer.</p><p>Voc\u00ea n\u00e3o foi para sua casa, pois sabia que ele iria parecer por l\u00e1, de cabe\u00e7a quente e sem rumo, foi parar em uma boate, se sentou em uma mesa, pediu bebida e se afogou a noite toda na m\u00e1goa e no \u00e1lcool. Um pouco consciente, voc\u00ea pediu pra uma amiga sua ir te buscar l\u00e1 na boate. N\u00e3o demorou muito para o garoto te encontrar, ele foi at\u00e9 a casa de sua amiga, e tentou entrar, mas ela n\u00e3o deixou ele entrar, dias se passaram e ele ia la todos os dias e te mandava v\u00e1rias mensagens com pedidos de perd\u00e3o.</p><p>Certo dia vc estava s\u00f3 na casa da sua amiga, ja estava a noite, ouviu batidas baixas na porta, sabia quem era, mas n\u00e3o atendeu a porta, ficou ao lado dela, com o cora\u00e7\u00e3o doendo, era t\u00e3o dif\u00edcil n\u00e3o poder abrir a porta e beijar ele, dar todo o amor e carinho. Pouco tempo depois voc\u00ea ouviu a voz baixa e carregada de tristeza de Namjoon do outro lado da porta.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Eu sei que voc\u00ea est\u00e1 ai s/n, sei que tamb\u00e9m sente minha falta, e eu sinto a sua, a todo o momento, e eu sei o que fiz foi errado, ou melhor, foi pessimo, sei que mere\u00e7o tudo isso que est\u00e1 acontecendo, \u00e9 s\u00f3 que, por Deus, doi demais, doi tanto que nem consigo pensar. Eu n\u00e3o acredito como pude ser t\u00e3o cego, como pude me deixar ser t\u00e3o baixo e fazer isso com voc\u00ea e comigo tamb\u00e9m, eu arruinei tudo para n\u00f3s, n\u00e9? Essa \u00e9 a \u00faltima vez que venho aqui, essa \u00e9 a \u00faltima vez que venho atrapalhar sua vida, eu s\u00f3 quero que saiba eu te amo, muito muito, e eu n\u00e3o te mere\u00e7o e nunca irei merecer uma mulher como voc\u00ea. Do fundo do meu cora\u00e7\u00e3o, quero que seja feliz. Adeus, minha ursinha.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b>Final 1: </b></p><p>Voc\u00ea j\u00e1 sem conter suas a\u00e7\u00f5es, abre a porta e vai para o bra\u00e7o do mai velho, que tamb\u00e9m chorava assim como voc\u00ea. Voc\u00eas ficaram ali, parados por um tempo, chorando e matando a saudade do cheiro um do outro..Voc\u00ea olha para o garoto e fala.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Eu irei te perdoar, DESSA VEZ, eu senti que suas desculpas foram sinceras, e do fundo do meu cora\u00e7\u00e3o espero que isso nunca mais se repita, est\u00e1 bem?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Claro meu amor, de hoje em diante farei o poss\u00edvel para me redimir, eu prometo.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b>Final 2: </b></p><p>Ap\u00f3s ouvir essas palavras, seu corpo e sua mente s\u00f3 queria uma coisa: abrir a porta e ir. Mas n\u00e3o, algo a impediu de fazer isso, mera palavras n\u00e3o iam mudar tudo que aconteceu, voc\u00ea o perdoaria, mas n\u00e3o o queria de volta, n\u00e3o queria ter que ser deitar ao lado de um traidor, e fica para sempre com medo de ser enganada novamente.

Algum tempo depois, voc&ecirc; conheceu novas pessoas, novos sabores, novas bocas e novas oportunidades, e obviamente n&atilde;o perdeu tempo. </p><p>Passou um tempo, e voc&ecirc; soube que a tal namorada de Jin tinha terminado com ele, ela s&oacute; queria uma vida boa ao lado de um trouxa, e arrumou Jin. Depois que conseguiu tudo que queria, largou o garoto triste e de cora&ccedil;&atilde;o partido. Ap&oacute;s isso, Jin milagrosamente lembrou da sua exist&ecirc;ncia e come&ccedil;ou a mandar mensagens e pedindo perd&atilde;o, pena que ja era tarde demais.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Eu sei que fui muito babaca com voc&ecirc;, e me arrependo muito, muito mesmo. Eu me sinto um lixo por ter recusado seus sentimentos reais e ter aceitado os falsos, se eu pudesse voltar no tempo, escolheria voc&ecirc;, e faria de tudo pra ser pelo menos a metade do que merece.&rdquo;</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/70850d9870782ed71b755bd09cbc4d53/tumblr_ppi29pR1Ge1wrzlzc_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><h2>Yoongi;</h2><p>Yoon, seu namorado, e voc&ecirc; estavam passando por uma fase bem complicada. O relacionamento est&aacute; muito frio e sem gra&ccedil;a, n&atilde;o saiam mais, mal se beijavam e muito menos transavam, estava uma cat&aacute;strofe. Voc&ecirc;s estavam cada vez mais distantes, voc&ecirc; tentava se reaproximar do garoto, mas ele n&atilde;o fazia mais quest&atilde;o, as vezes parecia que ele n&atilde;o te amava mais.</p><p>Algum tempo depois, vc comecou a notar que Yoongi estava andando bem felizinho, sorrindo pelos cantos, ficava com cara de bobo apaixonado sempre que ficava no celular, voc&ecirc; realmente tentou fingir que isso n&atilde;o lhe partia o cora&ccedil;&atilde;o, mas estava cada vez mais imposs&iacute;vel. Ent&atilde;o depois de pensar muito, decide conversa com ele e resolver tudo.</p><p>E infelizmente o pior aconteceu, Yoongi estava apaixonado por sua nova amiga de trabalho, e ele admitiu isso pra voc&ecirc;, dizendo que n&atilde;o sentia mais nada, e que queria dar um fim a tudo que voc&ecirc; tiveram. Voc&ecirc; n&atilde;o estava acreditando nisso, ele iria mesmo te trocar, a pessoa que sempre o apoiou e esteve ao lado dele nas horas boas e ruins, por uma garota que mal conhecia? </p><p>Voc&ecirc; sem escolha, o deixou partir, afinal, por que ficar ao lado de algu&eacute;m que est&aacute; apaixonado por um outro algu&eacute;m? Foi a a coisa mais dif&iacute;cil, mas foi necess&aacute;rio. Yoongi e a garota come&ccedil;aram a se envolver, depois do dia em que ele foi embora, nunca mais te ligou ou mandou mensagens,  estava ocupado demais conquistando a garota nova.</p><p>Por&eacute;m o mundo d&aacute; voltas, e a garota que ele gostava, n&atilde;o gostava dele, ela j&aacute; tinha &ldquo;namorado&rdquo;, e n&atilde;o trocaria algo t&atilde;o lindo e puro por algo moment&acirc;neo, o que fez Yoongi cair na real, e se dar conta que tinha desgra&ccedil;ado a vida dele de vez. E a dor veio, veio de uma forma t&atilde;o forte e enlouquecedora, olhar para o lado e ver que a melhor coisa que voc&ecirc; tinha foi embora - por sua pr&oacute;pria culpa - com toda a certeza &eacute; algo que ele n&atilde;o desejaria a ningu&eacute;m. Enquanto voc&ecirc; se reerguia, ele se afundava ainda mais, seja no &aacute;lcool, tristeza, ou trabalho, ele sempre tentava arranjar um meio de te esquecer, de n&atilde;o ir at&eacute; sua casa e implorar para ter a sol novamente na vida dele, por que naquele momento so chovia, mas ele deixou para l&aacute;, n&atilde;o queria atrapalhar sua vida, e sabia que voc&ecirc; jamais o perdoaria pelo que ele fez, por&eacute;m l&aacute; no fundo, ele tinha uma esperan&ccedil;a de que voc&ecirc; o aceitasse novamente.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Eu gostaria de me jogar fora, mas se eu me jogar, quem &eacute; que vai me pegar de volta? A &uacute;nica pessoa que eu tinha, se foi, e eu me culpo por isso, todos os malditos dias, e cada vez doi mais, achei que ia passar, mas n&atilde;o passa&hellip; Eu me arrependo tanto, que nem sei explicar, eu s&oacute; queria ele de volta, a solid&atilde;o est&aacute; cada vez me consumindo, meus dias s&atilde;o escuros e frios, volte meu amor&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4f43dda24d6bdf024923b27c6c045eb5/tumblr_ppi29fWfDb1wrzlzc_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><h2><span class=\"npf_color_monica\">Hoseok</span>;</h2><p>Voc&ecirc; e sua amiga eram afim de Hobi, ambas gostavam de disputar por qual ele se apaixonaria, e que levaria numa boa caso escolhesse uma ou outra, e foi aconteceu. Ele chamou sua amiga para sair e como prometeram, levou isso numa &ldquo;boa&rdquo;, tirando a parte que ficou bem triste, mas torceu por eles.</p><p>Ele come&ccedil;aram a namorar, por&eacute;m sua amiga o tra&iacute;a com outra garota, e voc&ecirc; sabia, por&eacute;m n&atilde;o falou nada porqu&ecirc; ela ainda era sua amiga n&eacute;. Por azar de sua amiga, Hoseok descobriu que ela o tra&iacute;a e terminou com a garota. Dois dias depois ele te chamou para ir tomar algo. Chegando l&aacute; ele disse que sabia sobre seus sentimentos, sua amiga tinha o contado sobre voc&ecirc;s duas estarem gostando dele. E ele disse que sempre te achou uma gracinha, e boa demais para ele, e se perguntava o por qu&ecirc; de uma garota t&atilde;o incr&iacute;vel estar interessada por ele (??&iquest;&iquest;), e perguntou se voc&ecirc; ainda tinha sentimentos por ele, e se tivesse ele faria de tudo para dar certo dessa vez.

Voc&ecirc; j&aacute; suspeitava do que estava rolando, mas foi ver se era verdade mesmo.</p><p>Era 20h30 da noite, e Namjoon como sempre n&atilde;o tinha chegado, e voc&ecirc;, preocupada e desconfiada, foi atr&aacute;s do seu namorado, seu cora&ccedil;&atilde;o do&iacute;a, e seu est&ocirc;mago embrulhada a cada passo que se aproximava do pr&eacute;dio da BH. Chegando l&aacute;, subiu as escadas e foi ao estudio do garoto, e antes de bater na porta ouviu um &ldquo;Namjoonn..&rdquo; arrastado, como um gemido, seu cora&ccedil;&atilde;o parou e seu est&ocirc;mago embrulho tanto que quase te fez vomitar, tentou abrir a porta, mas estava trancada, ent&atilde;o deu batidas fracas e ocas na porta a sua frente. A voz de Namjoon perguntou quem estava do outro lado, e nada foi ouvido, voc&ecirc; j&aacute; chorava, sabia o que estava rolando.</p><p>Poucos segundos a porta se abre a voc&ecirc; se depara com um Namjoon suado e com a camisa um pouco desabotoada, e uma mulher limpando os l&aacute;bios vermelhos borrados. Namjoon e a mulher ficaram chocados ao te ver ali, nao esperavam que a corna apareceria para acabar com a festa. Voc&ecirc; saiu dali o mais r&aacute;pido poss&iacute;vel, e Namjoon continuou est&aacute;tico na porta, sem saber o que fazer.</p><p>Voc&ecirc; n&atilde;o foi para sua casa, pois sabia que ele iria parecer por l&aacute;, de cabe&ccedil;a quente e sem rumo, foi parar em uma boate, se sentou em uma mesa, pediu bebida e se afogou a noite toda na m&aacute;goa e no &aacute;lcool. Um pouco consciente, voc&ecirc; pediu pra uma amiga sua ir te buscar l&aacute; na boate. N&atilde;o demorou muito para o garoto te encontrar, ele foi at&eacute; a casa de sua amiga, e tentou entrar, mas ela n&atilde;o deixou ele entrar, dias se passaram e ele ia la todos os dias e te mandava v&aacute;rias mensagens com pedidos de perd&atilde;o.</p><p>Certo dia vc estava s&oacute; na casa da sua amiga, ja estava a noite, ouviu batidas baixas na porta, sabia quem era, mas n&atilde;o atendeu a porta, ficou ao lado dela, com o cora&ccedil;&atilde;o doendo, era t&atilde;o dif&iacute;cil n&atilde;o poder abrir a porta e beijar ele, dar todo o amor e carinho. Pouco tempo depois voc&ecirc; ouviu a voz baixa e carregada de tristeza de Namjoon do outro lado da porta.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Eu sei que voc&ecirc; est&aacute; ai s/n, sei que tamb&eacute;m sente minha falta, e eu sinto a sua, a todo o momento, e eu sei o que fiz foi errado, ou melhor, foi pessimo, sei que mere&ccedil;o tudo isso que est&aacute; acontecendo, &eacute; s&oacute; que, por Deus, doi demais, doi tanto que nem consigo pensar.

Voc&ecirc;s ficaram ali, parados por um tempo, chorando e matando a saudade do cheiro um do outro..Voc&ecirc; olha para o garoto e fala.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Eu irei te perdoar, DESSA VEZ, eu senti que suas desculpas foram sinceras, e do fundo do meu cora&ccedil;&atilde;o espero que isso nunca mais se repita, est&aacute; bem?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Claro meu amor, de hoje em diante farei o poss&iacute;vel para me redimir, eu prometo.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b>Final 2: </b></p><p>Ap&oacute;s ouvir essas palavras, seu corpo e sua mente s&oacute; queria uma coisa: abrir a porta e ir. Mas n&atilde;o, algo a impediu de fazer isso, mera palavras n&atilde;o iam mudar tudo que aconteceu, voc&ecirc; o perdoaria, mas n&atilde;o o queria de volta, n&atilde;o queria ter que ser deitar ao lado de um traidor, e fica para sempre com medo de ser enganada novamente. Era doloroso mas necess&aacute;rio. </p><p>Passos come&ccedil;aram a se afastar lentamente da porta, e um abafado choro era aud&iacute;vel, ele estava chorando, seu cora&ccedil;&atilde;o se quebrou ainda mais, voc&ecirc; o amava muito, mas amava a si mesma mais. Ent&atilde;o o deixou ir, e voc&ecirc;s sabiam que n&atilde;o tinha volta, aquela era a &uacute;ltima vez que ficaram &ldquo;pr&oacute;ximos&rdquo; um do outro.
