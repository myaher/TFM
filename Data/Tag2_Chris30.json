Nothing about you, I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; was all he said in reply before you clutched your stomach, Chris slapped his chest and you both laughed loudly in the otherwise silent morning. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright I&rsquo;m a fucking meatball, now come in so we don&rsquo;t freeze our bits off and you can ask me all the <i>product</i> questions you want,&rdquo; he wheezed, as he stepped back inside his large porch.</p><p>For a second, you contemplated staying professional by kindly rejecting his offer until you heard his cheerful voice call out, &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon you&rsquo;re letting all the cold in!&rdquo;</p><p>Again, you tried to control your heart&rsquo;s loud thumps as you followed his sweet voice and closed the door behind you.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p><b>Tag list:</b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPJVwxDeaQzxOgOZH4jTZ3w\">@princess-evans-addict</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfBS0BI2T_apEQcN2Elg4vg\">@mrs-captain-evans</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mojTzUSISFcP8FJsErg1QsA\">@nervousfandomlover</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn4Wed_suJU2W15Oi3TicMg\">@whiskey-cokenfanfic</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mH7xZfPLDjciBP2SWY0sT6A\">@brittyevans</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGsphtdYVThSHWwN7skPB0A\">@xxim-evans-trashhxx</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mz3sYlsSO_gdKKebPUh9ymQ\">@capsheadquaters</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCXZ3dv93iyP1BGPRhVUT0g\">@cevansgirl</a>  <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mENqjE_LQ5NPl5g5Qcz5BMg\">@velvetbarnes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVoNc9v17pyPbIunfxcE0hA\">@katiew1973</a>  <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mF7uw-MjkHrsBCE13OXjAQg\">@guccievans</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muzaTi-rD3DLEuZf2J_eykQ\">@stanclub</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6JaOhLc7o7BDEgZtGxYWiQ\">@loricameback</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJK96QQPT-FvXe-Hdi1nPmA\">@if-n0t-l8ter-when</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYOo_hessZvLRbEoIENnpuA\">@sgtevanstan</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mklkZ0WDDCgHBRbTDgg_EfA\">@cmorgana</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvx92Ca0bmTX9IHcJIKCwOQ\">@patzammit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhbLMSCtxHviWHlSwUmnVKA\">@letstalkaboutsebbaby</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbX4sWNuBUXVcwsjALyT0uw\">@thegetawaywriter</a>&nbsp; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mE8PwfHGgQjGLK0cjfOpThA\">@notyourtypicalrose</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miCK4X7M_2IwmUOnWC6AgXw\">@sarahp879</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3oVXVm_CJfrBWJsvf7wX4Q\">@buckmesideways22</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mo54KJ9ZpzExii61c3hgsOQ\">@uhlxisback</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGY5UBJJzXCZKcwprdJ170A\">@stuck-y-together</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZJu5YYbmX4eKPpS61ctHVg\">@the-winter-soldxer</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHiOsP1pIYZ-of6lVC66wsg\">@themusicplayedherlife</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtaamNtm3g2UU6Ldi_W9ubg\">@my-emotional-self</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFFBE1xgrmYFrJtST7MgXRQ\">@marvelspnbaby</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDUP8aNqVXQuEY7DIRuOJIQ\">@writingsblock</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUn6aEZ-TbPtOgDiIDdyteA\">@i-dont-do-rpfs</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhx9HaY1ehCowYgS41PrZCw\">@writingsofaninvisiblegirl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLy-W41ENWqMb6hvzkyuJ8g\">@great-neckpectations</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mc-H1XakkBQURJxNxbBZHMg\">@bi4themcu</a> </p><p>If you want to be added/removed to the tag list, message or reply to let me know!</p></p>",

Can I get you a towel?\u201d You rush over to your convenient stack of freshly clean hand towels picking up a couple for him to use as he stands once again and slowly peels off his drenched and dirty tee. \u00a0Once sufficiently dry - but not too dry - he lays back down and stretches out underneath, this time making sure not to cover himself in greasy water while clearing the problem. As he uses wrenches and screwdrivers his muscles move under the skin making you squeeze your thighs together; the small grunts that escape from him when he finds something just a little too tight have you practically wringing your hands into fists.</p><p>You stand admiring his taught and toned torso, the low slung jeans that are probably held on only by sheer will power. \u00a0His chest and stomach have a smattering of dark hair and where he\u2019s been working in a confined space there is a light sheen of sweat that covers all skin on show. \u00a0As Mr. Moustache emerges from under the sink, clearly victorious, he has grease across his forehead and chest; he stands holding a large heavy wrench in his hand as he declares your sink to be fixed.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you so much!\u201d You gush like the helpless woman you are and then turn to head towards your handbag which is sat on the floor beside a dining chair. \u00a0Pulling your semi-sheer negligee tight against your figure you bend down to rummage for your purse. \u00a0Your ass is perfectly directioned at Mr. Moustache who watches in obvious awe because you\u2019re the sexiest woman he has ever laid eyes on.</p><p>You stand and turn to him \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u2026..I seem to have run short of money\u2026\u201d you step up close against him and lay your hand around the wrench before suggestively stroking along its length. \u00a0\u201cIs there maybe\u2026 another way I can pay?\u201d</p><p>The plumber smiles and without warning he wraps an arm around your waist to pull you against him then immediately kisses you so passionately that you momentarily forget what day it is. \u00a0The kiss becomes frantic and he drops the wrench to the floor so both of his hands can roam over your figure; teasing your nipples through the lace until your moaning into his mouth. \u00a0You back up against the dining table and lift your negligee to tease what is underneath. \u00a0Skin, skin is underneath because you don\u2019t ever wear underwear around the house on a normal day when you\u2019re expecting someone. \u00a0Mr. Moustache is impressed and drops down to his knees then buries his face between your thighs; your head drops back and you moan in pleasure as his tongue explores every part of your pussy over and over. \u00a0You moan and groan so loudly that the neighbours will no doubt say you were faking but you\u2019ll insist that he was just that good. \u00a0Nobody will know who is telling the truth.</p><p>The man stands, pulling away from your clit with a moan of his own then undoes his jeans to push them down - he too, wears no underwear. \u00a0You immediately gasp at his size because he\u2019s the largest you\u2019ve ever seen; you have no idea how he is going to fit inside you but you reach down and wrap a hand around his member, stroking him slowly and making him grunt a little while watching you. \u00a0Soon he is at full hardness and you\u2019re once again amazed at his sheer size; he grips your hips and stands you down before turning you to face away from him and bending you over the dining table sending your clean towel pile flying to the floor.</p><p>Your negligee is hitched up to reveal your bare ass which he revels in spanking until it\u2019s pink; you moan with each landing of his hand. \u00a0Finally he spreads your legs teases your pussy with his fingers until you\u2019re writhing and whining for him to fill you with his cock. \u00a0He gives no warning but thrusts into you fully with ease; you feel no discomfort and you take his full length and girth with no issue. \u00a0Mr. Moustache lets out a rough groan and grits his teeth as he thrusts into you; he leans a foot up onto a dining chair for better angle and because of course he looks amazing doing it. \u00a0You grip the table and whine, moan, suck in air between your teeth because even though he\u2019s barely done anything to you, you\u2019re already going to reach climax.</p><p>Seemingly sensing how close you are and clearly not ready to let himself release yet the Plumber pulls out of you and spins you to face him again, lifting your negligee up and over your head he then picks you up and thrusts back into you while using the tall fridge-freezer to fuck you against. \u00a0Your hair flows down over your face and shoulders in such a way that it frames your looks of pleasure, your breasts are perky and mesmerise the Plumber with every move they make as he bounces you and snaps his hips deep. \u00a0He again grunts rarely but pants heavily, his hands grip your buttocks and bruise while pulling you down onto him. \u00a0You loud groans and repeated \u201cYes!! Yes!!\u201d let him know that you\u2019re close and this time he doesn\u2019t stop. \u00a0 This time he speeds up and make sure his full length is pumping into you on every single thrust. \u00a0He growls and throws his head back; he has to stay in control, not yet! \u00a0You wind your arms around his shoulders and arch your back letting out a breathless mewl as you orgasm around him; quick as a flash he\u2019s placed you on the floor and you know what you have to do. \u00a0You kneel in front of him and push your breasts together then open your mouth, tongue stuck out as far as it would go. \u00a0Mr. Moustache wraps a hand around himself and jerks until he releases into your mouth, moaning in pleasure and watching it drip down onto your perfect breasts.</p><p>You swallow and then clean the edges of your mouth, picking up your negligee from the floor you pull it on and run a hand through your hair to once again tame it. \u00a0The Plumber redresses himself and picks up his tool box \u201cYou have a good afternoon ma\u2019am.\u201d tipping his non-existent cowboy hat once again.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you so much for cleaning my pipes.\u201d you lick your lips as he leaves and then realise he\u2019s left his large wrench behind for another day.</p><p>&mdash; fin &mdash;</p>",

Can I get you a towel?\u201d You rush over to your convenient stack of freshly clean hand towels picking up a couple for him to use as he stands once again and slowly peels off his drenched and dirty tee. \u00a0Once sufficiently dry - but not too dry - he lays back down and stretches out underneath, this time making sure not to cover himself in greasy water while clearing the problem. As he uses wrenches and screwdrivers his muscles move under the skin making you squeeze your thighs together; the small grunts that escape from him when he finds something just a little too tight have you practically wringing your hands into fists.</p><p>You stand admiring his taught and toned torso, the low slung jeans that are probably held on only by sheer will power. \u00a0His chest and stomach have a smattering of dark hair and where he\u2019s been working in a confined space there is a light sheen of sweat that covers all skin on show. \u00a0As Mr. Moustache emerges from under the sink, clearly victorious, he has grease across his forehead and chest; he stands holding a large heavy wrench in his hand as he declares your sink to be fixed.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you so much!\u201d You gush like the helpless woman you are and then turn to head towards your handbag which is sat on the floor beside a dining chair. \u00a0Pulling your semi-sheer negligee tight against your figure you bend down to rummage for your purse. \u00a0Your ass is perfectly directioned at Mr. Moustache who watches in obvious awe because you\u2019re the sexiest woman he has ever laid eyes on.</p><p>You stand and turn to him \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u2026..I seem to have run short of money\u2026\u201d you step up close against him and lay your hand around the wrench before suggestively stroking along its length. \u00a0\u201cIs there maybe\u2026 another way I can pay?\u201d</p><p>The plumber smiles and without warning he wraps an arm around your waist to pull you against him then immediately kisses you so passionately that you momentarily forget what day it is. \u00a0The kiss becomes frantic and he drops the wrench to the floor so both of his hands can roam over your figure; teasing your nipples through the lace until your moaning into his mouth. \u00a0You back up against the dining table and lift your negligee to tease what is underneath. \u00a0Skin, skin is underneath because you don\u2019t ever wear underwear around the house on a normal day when you\u2019re expecting someone. \u00a0Mr. Moustache is impressed and drops down to his knees then buries his face between your thighs; your head drops back and you moan in pleasure as his tongue explores every part of your pussy over and over. \u00a0You moan and groan so loudly that the neighbours will no doubt say you were faking but you\u2019ll insist that he was just that good. \u00a0Nobody will know who is telling the truth.</p><p>The man stands, pulling away from your clit with a moan of his own then undoes his jeans to push them down - he too, wears no underwear. \u00a0You immediately gasp at his size because he\u2019s the largest you\u2019ve ever seen; you have no idea how he is going to fit inside you but you reach down and wrap a hand around his member, stroking him slowly and making him grunt a little while watching you. \u00a0Soon he is at full hardness and you\u2019re once again amazed at his sheer size; he grips your hips and stands you down before turning you to face away from him and bending you over the dining table sending your clean towel pile flying to the floor.</p><p>Your negligee is hitched up to reveal your bare ass which he revels in spanking until it\u2019s pink; you moan with each landing of his hand. \u00a0Finally he spreads your legs teases your pussy with his fingers until you\u2019re writhing and whining for him to fill you with his cock. \u00a0He gives no warning but thrusts into you fully with ease; you feel no discomfort and you take his full length and girth with no issue. \u00a0Mr. Moustache lets out a rough groan and grits his teeth as he thrusts into you; he leans a foot up onto a dining chair for better angle and because of course he looks amazing doing it. \u00a0You grip the table and whine, moan, suck in air between your teeth because even though he\u2019s barely done anything to you, you\u2019re already going to reach climax.</p><p>Seemingly sensing how close you are and clearly not ready to let himself release yet the Plumber pulls out of you and spins you to face him again, lifting your negligee up and over your head he then picks you up and thrusts back into you while using the tall fridge-freezer to fuck you against. \u00a0Your hair flows down over your face and shoulders in such a way that it frames your looks of pleasure, your breasts are perky and mesmerise the Plumber with every move they make as he bounces you and snaps his hips deep. \u00a0He again grunts rarely but pants heavily, his hands grip your buttocks and bruise while pulling you down onto him. \u00a0You loud groans and repeated \u201cYes!! Yes!!\u201d let him know that you\u2019re close and this time he doesn\u2019t stop. \u00a0 This time he speeds up and make sure his full length is pumping into you on every single thrust. \u00a0He growls and throws his head back; he has to stay in control, not yet! \u00a0You wind your arms around his shoulders and arch your back letting out a breathless mewl as you orgasm around him; quick as a flash he\u2019s placed you on the floor and you know what you have to do. \u00a0You kneel in front of him and push your breasts together then open your mouth, tongue stuck out as far as it would go. \u00a0Mr. Moustache wraps a hand around himself and jerks until he releases into your mouth, moaning in pleasure and watching it drip down onto your perfect breasts.</p><p>You swallow and then clean the edges of your mouth, picking up your negligee from the floor you pull it on and run a hand through your hair to once again tame it. \u00a0The Plumber redresses himself and picks up his tool box \u201cYou have a good afternoon ma\u2019am.\u201d tipping his non-existent cowboy hat once again.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you so much for cleaning my pipes.\u201d you lick your lips as he leaves and then realise he\u2019s left his large wrench behind for another day.</p><p>\u2014 fin \u2014</p>",

As he uses wrenches and screwdrivers his muscles move under the skin making you squeeze your thighs together; the small grunts that escape from him when he finds something just a little too tight have you practically wringing your hands into fists.</p><p>You stand admiring his taught and toned torso, the low slung jeans that are probably held on only by sheer will power. \u00a0His chest and stomach have a smattering of dark hair and where he\u2019s been working in a confined space there is a light sheen of sweat that covers all skin on show. \u00a0As Mr. Moustache emerges from under the sink, clearly victorious, he has grease across his forehead and chest; he stands holding a large heavy wrench in his hand as he declares your sink to be fixed.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you so much!\u201d You gush like the helpless woman you are and then turn to head towards your handbag which is sat on the floor beside a dining chair. \u00a0Pulling your semi-sheer negligee tight against your figure you bend down to rummage for your purse. \u00a0Your ass is perfectly directioned at Mr. Moustache who watches in obvious awe because you\u2019re the sexiest woman he has ever laid eyes on.</p><p>You stand and turn to him \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u2026..I seem to have run short of money\u2026\u201d you step up close against him and lay your hand around the wrench before suggestively stroking along its length. \u00a0\u201cIs there maybe\u2026 another way I can pay?\u201d</p><p>The plumber smiles and without warning he wraps an arm around your waist to pull you against him then immediately kisses you so passionately that you momentarily forget what day it is. \u00a0The kiss becomes frantic and he drops the wrench to the floor so both of his hands can roam over your figure; teasing your nipples through the lace until your moaning into his mouth. \u00a0You back up against the dining table and lift your negligee to tease what is underneath. \u00a0Skin, skin is underneath because you don\u2019t ever wear underwear around the house on a normal day when you\u2019re expecting someone. \u00a0Mr. Moustache is impressed and drops down to his knees then buries his face between your thighs; your head drops back and you moan in pleasure as his tongue explores every part of your pussy over and over. \u00a0You moan and groan so loudly that the neighbours will no doubt say you were faking but you\u2019ll insist that he was just that good. \u00a0Nobody will know who is telling the truth.</p><p>The man stands, pulling away from your clit with a moan of his own then undoes his jeans to push them down - he too, wears no underwear. \u00a0You immediately gasp at his size because he\u2019s the largest you\u2019ve ever seen; you have no idea how he is going to fit inside you but you reach down and wrap a hand around his member, stroking him slowly and making him grunt a little while watching you. \u00a0Soon he is at full hardness and you\u2019re once again amazed at his sheer size; he grips your hips and stands you down before turning you to face away from him and bending you over the dining table sending your clean towel pile flying to the floor.</p><p>Your negligee is hitched up to reveal your bare ass which he revels in spanking until it\u2019s pink; you moan with each landing of his hand. \u00a0Finally he spreads your legs teases your pussy with his fingers until you\u2019re writhing and whining for him to fill you with his cock. \u00a0He gives no warning but thrusts into you fully with ease; you feel no discomfort and you take his full length and girth with no issue. \u00a0Mr. Moustache lets out a rough groan and grits his teeth as he thrusts into you; he leans a foot up onto a dining chair for better angle and because of course he looks amazing doing it. \u00a0You grip the table and whine, moan, suck in air between your teeth because even though he\u2019s barely done anything to you, you\u2019re already going to reach climax.</p><p>Seemingly sensing how close you are and clearly not ready to let himself release yet the Plumber pulls out of you and spins you to face him again, lifting your negligee up and over your head he then picks you up and thrusts back into you while using the tall fridge-freezer to fuck you against. \u00a0Your hair flows down over your face and shoulders in such a way that it frames your looks of pleasure, your breasts are perky and mesmerise the Plumber with every move they make as he bounces you and snaps his hips deep. \u00a0He again grunts rarely but pants heavily, his hands grip your buttocks and bruise while pulling you down onto him. \u00a0You loud groans and repeated \u201cYes!! Yes!!\u201d let him know that you\u2019re close and this time he doesn\u2019t stop. \u00a0 This time he speeds up and make sure his full length is pumping into you on every single thrust. \u00a0He growls and throws his head back; he has to stay in control, not yet! \u00a0You wind your arms around his shoulders and arch your back letting out a breathless mewl as you orgasm around him; quick as a flash he\u2019s placed you on the floor and you know what you have to do. \u00a0You kneel in front of him and push your breasts together then open your mouth, tongue stuck out as far as it would go. \u00a0Mr. Moustache wraps a hand around himself and jerks until he releases into your mouth, moaning in pleasure and watching it drip down onto your perfect breasts.</p><p>You swallow and then clean the edges of your mouth, picking up your negligee from the floor you pull it on and run a hand through your hair to once again tame it. \u00a0The Plumber redresses himself and picks up his tool box \u201cYou have a good afternoon ma\u2019am.\u201d tipping his non-existent cowboy hat once again.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you so much for cleaning my pipes.\u201d you lick your lips as he leaves and then realise he\u2019s left his large wrench behind for another day.</p><p>\u2014 fin \u2014</p>",

A look around the room revealed her suitcase and a large soft luggage bag neatly stacked near his closet, her purse on the nearby chair. The pillow he was hugging still smelled like her shampoo and he smiled at the memory of them showering together and how he had insisted on washing her hair, his hands working the long strands into different hairstyles while she laughed at his portray of a flamboyant hairdresser.</p><!-- more --><p>They\u2019d arrived home around 8 pm after Garret read him the riot act while Lucy gathered her stuff. <i>He\u2019d better not fuck this up, was he sure he wanted to pursue this? Otherwise he better end their date right there.</i></p><p>Date. Chris scoffed at the word. He was sure Lucy still didn\u2019t know the meeting at the game was a set-up arranged by her sister and his best friend; a blind date where only one of them knew they were on a date at all. Penny insisted Lucy wouldn\u2019t come if she were to tell her and it was up to Chris to make the move.</p><p>Ever since he wrapped Gifted and came back home complaining he had had enough of the Hollywood dating scene, Penny redoubled her efforts to get Chris and Lucy together. <i>\u201cShe\u2019s the sweetest girl, Chris, always there with a smile when I was hurt. She was the first to organize a fundraising and collecting food and clothes after the Mitchell\u2019s house fire. She\u2019s got the biggest heart of anyone I know and they abused her trust. She\u2019s been hurt pretty and she\u2019s afraid of trying again. I believe you can change that.\u201d</i> Penny said over pizza one day. Chris had his doubts, not sure if he was ready to deal with so much baggage. <i>\u201cWould you date her?\u201d</i> Chris asked Garret over beers, <i>\u201cShe\u2019s fragile man but she\u2019s a special girl. Hell yes, I\u2019d date her. She\u2019s wicked smart, sassy as hell and can make you laugh like a lunatic plus, she\u2019s built like a fifties pin-up girl, all tits, ass, and thighs. You keep saying you want something real, here\u2019s your chance at it.\u201d</i></p><p>So Chris agreed to the date, picking a football game for their first meeting, a common ground where both could still enjoy themselves if the chemistry wasn\u2019t there. Except they hit it off so good that any plans of taking her out for dinner so they could get to know each flew out of the window and now he was working backward to convince her she was more than a one-night stand.</p><p>The moment he left the bedroom Chris could hear Lucy singing downstairs. She wasn\u2019t going to win any Grammys but she wasn\u2019t bad either. He made his way downstairs carefully as to not alert her of his presence.</p><p>He stopped just before reaching the bottom, watching as Lucy belted the lyrics to an old pop song into a wooden spoon, moving around the kitchen with her eyes closed during the chorus. He watched as she opened and closed his cabinets, a quiet yay reaching his ears when she found a glass bowl, bringing the bowl with her back to the counter where eggs, cheese, sliced potatoes, and condiments all waited. And since when did he own a cast iron pan?</p><p>Lucy sang and danced while she mixed the ingredients, pouring them into the hot pan, her oversized nightshirt hanging loosely on her shoulders, purplish marks dotting her neck. He\u2019d never been one to leave them before but with her he was a man possessed, staking a claim so everyone could see she belonged with him. A twinge of jealousy hit him at the thought of a man getting closer enough to look at her neck.</p><p>Chris knew it was probably too early to feel that way but he wasn\u2019t concerned with a timetable any more. He\u2019d been infatuated with the idea of her for the past month and the reality turned out to be so much better. Their time at the museum yesterday had been fantastic, no awkward silences, no lulls in the conversation. He hanged into her every word, committing to memory every like and dislike she shared, wanting to know everything about the firecracker redhead who danced her way into his life.</p><p>He leaned against the fridge, crossing his arms.</p><p>\u201cIs there a cover fee for the show or is it included with breakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat depends, what kind of payment are we talking about?\u201d Lucy smiled brightly at him, rinsing her hands.</p><p>\u201cI can think of a few ways. I\u2019m also known for being a very generous tipper.\u201d</p><p>Chris walked over to her, picking up a napkin and drying each individual finger before bringing her hands over his neck, leaning down to gently kiss her.</p><p>\u201cTop o&rsquo; the mornin&rsquo; to ya, little lady.\u201d He smiled at her when their lips separated, tipping an imaginary hat at her.</p><p>\u201cMornin\u2019 sir,\u201d she giggled and did a little curtsy. \u201cGive it 25 minutes and you\u2019ll eat the best Spanish omelet of your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving so it better be good.\u201d Chris challenged, letting go of her to fill Dodger\u2019s food and water bowl.</p><p>\u201cOf your life.\u201d She pointed the wood spoon at his retrieving back.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very tall order little lady, I\u2019ve been alive for quite some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept that, I\u2019m older than you.\u201d She reminded Chris while she brought the coffee pot and the juice jar to the small breakfast table by the window.</p><p>\u201cYou know what that makes you, right?\u201d He called back to her, already on his way back from the laundry room.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She moved back to the counter, checking on the food on the stovetop, turning it off and moving the pan to the oven.</p><p>\u201cA cougar.\u201d He said was behind her, hands circling her waist and bringing her body close to his, his lips closing on the pulse point on her neck and effectively ending the protest on her lips. \u201cA very fine,\u201d kiss, \u201cgorgeous,\u201d bite, \u201cbeautiful cougar.\u201d</p><p>He sucked the tender skin where her neck met her shoulder, leaving yet another mark.</p><p>\u201cKeep that up and I\u2019ll need a scarf inside the house when I get to my parent\u2019s,\u201d she made no movement to stop him, hands resting over his.</p><p>\u201cYou have a very biteable neck.\u201d Chris kissed the same spot again just to prove a point and she giggled. \u201cI\u2019ll try to curb my inner vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour inner vampire is quite welcome to other places where I can better hide the evidence.\u201d Lucy looked back up to him, a hint of mischievousness in her voice.</p><p>His hands immediately moved to cup her breasts over her shirt. \u201cOh, you mean here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhm\u2026 or here.\u201d Lucy\u2019s hand gently guided him to the inside of her thighs.</p><p>\u201cYour idea is so much better than mine.\u201d Chris turned her around and his mouth immediately found hers in a powerful and possessive kiss.</p><p>He was rapidly becoming addicted to her mouth, her lips moving like fine silk on his, tongue searching for him, a delirious chase he couldn\u2019t get enough of. He heard her moan against his mouth and it stoked the fire already burning inside of him.</p><p>Chris\u2019 strong hands clutched Lucy\u2019s waist, bringing her closer to his body and in a swift movement he lifted and dropped her at the counter, her body bouncing when she landed.</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy, you could throw your back or someth\u2026\u201d</p><p>His lips quickly silenced her words and he nipped at her for good measure when they separated.</p><p>\u201cI can bench press over 300 pounds Lucy, and you weigh what, a bit more than half that? Let me worry about what I can and I can\u2019t handle,\u201d his hands slid up her thighs till he finds the white lace cheeky panties she wore, thumbs hooking around the lace and pulling them down as he whispered in her ear. \u201cI love how my hands are full of you when I run them up your thighs, when I grab your ass, how your breasts feel heavy on my hands\u2026 and just so you know I\u2019d love to fuck them.\u201d</p><p>A strangled moan escaped her at his words and she reached for his sweatpants, pushing them down, needing the contact, craving the feel of him. He rocked his hips on her, the head of his cock right on top of her clit, his bare length sliding up and down over her small lips, coating himself in her juices. \u201cI want you inside me, Chris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh, I\u2019m not finished. Trivia time. Did you know I had a crush on Jessica Rabbit the first time I saw Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\u201d Chris unbuttons her shirt, bottom to top, slowly unwrapping her like a present, thrusting against her with each new inch of skin he reveals, her moans spurring him on. \u201cTo my twelve-year-old self, she was the hottest woman I\u2019d ever seen, who cares if she was a cartoon. It was the first time I actively jerked off.\u201d He parted the sides of her nightgown, exposing her breast and he licks his lips at the sight of her naked chest. His hands tangle in her hair bringing the red strands around her left shoulder. Her eyes are blown, pupils dilated, almost no green left and he thinks she looked like a fucking goddess at that moment. He stood between her legs, his nose skimming the pulse point on her neck, lips following suit, before stepping back, making her pout for the lack of contact. \u201cGod, look at you, my personal Jessica Rabbit, pouty lips and all, my fucking wet dream coming true, sinful curves and deliciously naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen come here and fuck your Rabbit,\u201d she pulled him back, mouths clashing, tongues dancing together. Her hands roamed over the taut muscles of his arms, tracing the veins and kneading the flesh of his shoulders, fingertips caressing the nape of his neck with one hand while the other danced on the planes of his chest, following the trail of hair that led to his cock.</p><p>Lucy planted open-mouthed kisses on his chest, gently biting his right nipple, sucking the small hard nub in her mouth, enthralled by the sounds he made.</p><p>\u201cFuck, do that again,\u201d Chris asked in a low voice and she smiled against his chest, moving to the other side. She flattened her tongue against his nipple before closing her mouth against it, teeth rasping the pebbled skin and sucking hard and at the same time that she closed her hand over him, dragging her fingers over the crown in slow but precise motions. A guttural moan rocked his body and he thrust hard against her hand, pre-come leaking from the bulbous head.</p><p>\u201cHow did you like it?\u201d Lucy grinned up to him, hand fisting over his shaft as she licked around the tattoo on his ribcage.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2026 god, don\u2019t tease,\u201d he faltered when her fingers squeezed around him, both hands working in a precise rhythm. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely going into the pro column.\u201d</p><p>Her laugh is cut short when he pulls her hair back, covering her mouth with his. Their kisses became long and slow, fueled by their moans, tongues sinfully dancing together as hands travel everywhere; caressing her boobs, touching his ass, tangled in her hair, gripping his waist.</p><p>\u201cLay back on your arms.\u201d Chris nudges her back with a soft touch and she obeys, releasing his shaft and arranging herself on the black marble. Fingers and mouth working together, he traces a pattern over her body, stroking over her collarbone, rolling her nipples between expert fingers, dipping his tongue on her belly button. He nips at the small curve of her belly, biting and bruising the skin and smirks at her. \u201cNo one will see this one, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsidering it\u2019s not exactly swimming weather outside, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d she smiled and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he rubbed his bearded face on her inner thighs. \u201cI\u2019m not finished though.\u201d</p><p>Warm open-mouthed kisses on the inside of her thighs left her panting and pleading for more.</p><p>\u201cUse your words, Lucy.\u201d His warm breath tickled her lips, making her squirm.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tease me like that.\u201d Wild eyes glanced down, \u201cI want your mouth on me. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, madam.\u201d The feel of his silky tongue made her whole body undulate, a loud gasp echoing in the large room as he bathed her in slow and sure motions. He gave her a wicked grin before his lips closed on her clit, tongue swirling on the taut nerve and her hips lifted, legs jumping wildly. He hooked her left leg over his shoulder for anchorage, grasping the curve of her hips to keep her from moving and her small hand covered his, fingers tangling together. Chris smiled, eyes framed by long eyelashes looking up to her, loving to watch her surrender under his touch. He was lost to the scent of her, the sweet and tangy aroma filling his lungs.</p><p>\u201cChris.\u201d A gasp escaped her swollen lips, eyes fluttering close with each pass of his tongue, shallow breaths, and a racing heart.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re beautiful,\u201d His mouth barely leaves her to whisper his adoration. \u201cAre you ready for more baby?\u201d</p><p>Two fingers sank into her, scissoring and curling against her walls. He devoured her, lips and tongue working her clit, fingers hooked inside her, rubbing that sweet spot inside her over and over. Her hips thrust wildly upward, incomprehensible cries falling from her lips when he sped up his motions, humming his praise, the vibrations on causing the most delicious electric sparks making her legs writhe and sending her dangerously close to the edge.</p><p>Her body grew taut, goosebumps spreading all over and he felt her clenching his fingers, fingernails leaving small crescent shapes on the back of his hand before releasing his hand and threading them around his hair, keeping him where she needed the most.</p><p>\u201cSo close, oh god, I need\u2026 close.\u201d</p><p>His teeth scraped her clit and it\u2019s her undoing. Lucy cried out to him, tremors rocking her, legs quivering as he continued to touch her, transforming her orgasm in an ongoing sensation that washed over her back and forth every time his tongues her clit, fingers still moving inside her now with a renewed fervor.</p><p>\u201cGive one more baby, I know you have it in you.\u201d Another pair of fingers made contact with her clit, rubbing it in a maddening pace as he kisses her inner thighs, bruising the skin with his teeth. He slipped his fingers from inside her pussy, digits coated in her cum, and moved them lower, pressing them lightly against her puckered hole, making contact hard enough to let her know he\u2019s there. His tongue enters her, lapping up the escaping slick as his index fingers breached the impossibly tight hole.</p><p>\u201cChris, oh god, oh f\u2026\u201d a second wave hit her and her arm gave out, spasm taking over her body and her eyes rolled to the back of her head, the fire never ending, the darkness threatening to take over.</p><p>She pushed him away, her body spent as she laid on the counter, breathing heavily.</p><p>\u201cFuck, you look gorgeous when you cum,\u201d Chris&rsquo; eyes were zeroed on hers with a smug smile on his face, fingers slowly caressing the skin of her hips. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a moment, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m alive,\u201d Lucy closed her eyes, drawing a deep breath, the sound of his laugh making her smile. \u201cYep, I\u2019m alive.\u201d</p><p>Chris pulled her up and her hands immediately gravitated to his face, bringing him close, kissing his shiny lips, thumbing the moisture on his mustache and bringing it to her mouth, her tongue making a show of licking the digit clean, groaning at the taste of herself on him. He moaned and rocked himself against her core, callused hands curling on the skin of her bottom.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Lucy nuzzled his neck, kissing the smooth skin, her nose pressed on his beard, \u201cI\u2019ve never let anyone back there before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever?\u201d the whimper is followed by a grunt when she shook her head. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready, let me know, I can make you feel so, so good baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about I think about it and I get back to you on that.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause before he agreed and dove for her mouth, tongues dueling in a heated kiss, hissing when her hands closed around him, sliding up and down the length with torturous gestures.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never wanted anyone the way I want you,\u201d her hands stroked and twisted, creating the perfect amount of pressure that forced him to thrust back searching for more friction. Lucy nibbled his earlobe and murmured, \u201cGet inside me Chris, now.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a command he\u2019s eager to obey and he brings her closer to the edge of the counter, dragging his cock up her slit, making them both moan.</p><p>And then he stopped, looking around for a moment, groaning.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>His low curse made her head pop. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t bring any condoms down with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d The disbelief in her voice made him chuckle.</p><p>More expletives left his mouth as he opened a few drawers before finally admitting defeat with a shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cWell little rabbit, for starters my pants didn\u2019t have any pockets. Plus, I didn\u2019t exactly plan on fucking you on my counter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so sturdy though, it just begs for some action.\u201d She bounces a little, grinning at him.</p><p>Chris threw his head back with a laugh, raising both eyebrows at her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re using me for my kitchen, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, I\u2019ve been found,\u201d she snapped her fingers with a mocking frown.</p><p>\u201cCome on woman, let\u2019s go upstairs before\u2026\u201d</p><p>The oven pinged, signaling the food was ready.</p><p>\u201cThat.\u201d Chris dropped his head on her shoulder while Lucy tried to contain her mirth, certain he would not appreciate her laughing right now.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Lucy glanced from the oven back to him, fingers dancing between the hairs of his chest. \u201cI\u2019m alright with re-heated food if you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank fuck.\u201d He promptly hoisted her out of the counter, pausing just long enough to pick up his pants from the floor, just to look up and see her running up the stairs.</p><p>Lucy stopped on the middle step, shedding her shirt, calling out to him with her fingers. She squeaked and ran when Chris started after her, taking the steps two at a time, catching up to her right by his bedroom door, caging her body with his.</p><p>\u201cGotcha.\u201d Her whole skin prickled with his whisper and she couldn\u2019t help the moan that escaped when he bit her earlobe, tugging on the flesh. The feel of him rocking against her as he kissed the back of her neck reduced her to a quivering mess as he opened the door, directing her to the recently made bed.</p><p>Spinning in his arms, she kissed him hard, forcing his body toward the bed. \u201cLay down, keep your hands above your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBossy, bossy,\u201d Chris kissed her before laying down, making a show of shaking his ass at her, which earned him a playful swat. \u201cCareful with the merchandise woman.\u201d</p><p>Lucy giggle-snorted, shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ll handle all the packages with care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee that you do.\u201d He winked and got comfortable, holding onto the pillow under his head, licking his lips when she crawled over him, kneeling between his legs.</p><p>Her lips brushed over his brow, nose, and cheeks before touching his mouth, a pink tongue tracing his pouty lips. They kissed with their eyes open, Chris trying to follow her every time she retreated, only to kiss him again when his head hit the pillow with a growl.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be mean. I love kissing you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes crinkled, a smile tugging at the corner of her lips. The next time she didn\u2019t pull back, her tongue tangling with his, lips synced in a slow and sensuous dance, making his body buckle when she sucked his tongue, knuckles white from clutching the pillow.</p><p>She teased his neck, caressing the pulse point with her tongue, working her way down his body and Chris felt like fire wafted over his skin with each touch. Stopping over his dusky nipples, she replayed the earlier actions, this time with more teeth and Chris decided the move deserved a whole new column titled \u2018fucking brilliant\u2019. \u00a0</p><p>The hard muscles of his abdomen twitched when her teeth made contact, and she soothed him with butterfly kisses over the tattoo on his lower rib cage. The first dip of her tongue into his belly button bucked his hips, the anticipation consuming him as she licked over the thick line of hair connecting to the base of his cock, her nose nuzzling the velvet skin that rested over his lower abdomen.</p><p>\u201cLucy\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatience Chris.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to wait long, a hitched breath meeting the first touch of her tongue on the underside of his erection. She tempted him with one long lick before enveloping the head with her lips, tonguing the slit and tasting the drops of his salty pre-come already there.</p><p>An ache formed deep in his belly when her hands closed around him, pumping up and down the thick member, a thumb pressing the vein on the underside with every downward stroke. She cupped his balls as her mouth descended on him, sucking him slowly into her mouth, working her way down.</p><p>Chris wanted so badly to touch her, to run his hands everywhere while she claimed him, but he was good with following orders. \u201cGod, you\u2019re killing me, Lucy, such a pretty and talented mouth you have, fuck, so good around my cock.\u201d He heard and felt her moaning around him, the humming adding to his pleasure, and when she hollowed her cheeks and took him all the way he cursed loudly, body shaking. \u201cPlease, please let me touch you gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>She let him go with a pop, swirling her tongue around the weeping head, flattening her tongue and dragging over his frenulum, wanton eyes, dark and needy, never leaving him when she nodded and took him back into her mouth, her lips sinking until he could feel the back of her throat, grunting and fighting the urge to thrust up. He ran his hands over her shoulders, gentle fingers cupping her cheek while she engulfed him, her nose pressed to the trimmed hairs of his groin.</p><p>His labored breaths were cut by deep moans, pleasure cursing through this body.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not gonna last, baby.\u201d</p><p>His hands now played with her hair, gathering it to a side, holding it atop of her head and finally settling with tangling it all in a ponytail so he could watch what her as she worked to bring him to climax. The need to thrust became unbearable, a scorching heat consuming and overwhelming his senses.</p><p>\u201cLet it go, Chris,\u201d she enticed him and he surrendered, plunging against her mouth, marveling at the feeling of her silky tongue working over him when he retreated.</p><p>Sheer pleasure consumed him, the ache in his belly spreading all over him and he barely had time to warm her of his impending climax. Lucy paid him no mind, lips tight around his cock while two fingers pressed down on the perineum and he lost it, swelling and coating the inside of her mouth, hands tight on her hair to keep her from moving.</p><p>She swallowed and he groaned loudly, curses and moans mixed together while he sang her praises, calling her name over and over. Chris twitched when Lucy licked him clean, letting him go with a final pat to the head of his cock. A smile played on her lips as she gave him a small kiss at the corner of his lips before resting her head on the nook of his neck.</p><p>Chris was quiet for a moment before he let out a whistle.</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>Her body shook with contained laughter.</p><p>\u201cThat good, huh?\u201d Lucy drew small patterns on his chest and he rejoiced in the feeling of being so close to her.</p><p>\u201cFuck yes.\u201d He slowly kissed her, his tongue exploring the swollen lips. A small peck to her nose and he released her.</p><p>A blissful silence fell over them, his hands combing the long locks as she did the same to his beard. They stayed like that for some time, until Chris spoke again.</p><p>\u201cDo you have the number for The New York Times?\u201d He asked with a serious expression.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you need it for?\u201d Lucy side-eyed Chris.</p><p>\u201cI want to take out an ad and tell all those fools in New York City how incredibly stupid they are for passing you over. Or I might do a full-page \u201cthank you\u201d for the exact same reason, I\u2019m still undecided.\u201d He twisted them both till she was laying on top of him, taking the opportunity to run his hands over her ribcage, waist and finally resting both hands on her bottom, holding them loosely over her flesh.</p><p>\u201cAll of this over a good blowjob?\u201d She chuckled and adjusted herself so her pussy hovered over his hardening cock.</p><p>He shook his head and poked her on the side.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, but being on the receiving end of said blowjob I think you meant fantastic. Curl your toes and scream yourself hoarse fantastic,\u201d he is delighted when a blush covered not only the face but her breasts as well. He licked his lips and bucked against her, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m definitely thanking them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour recovering time is quite a feat, Chris.\u201d Her hips rocked slowly against him and Lucy left a small sigh when her clit rubbed on the veiny member.</p><p>He tightened his hold on her buttocks as she danced wantonly over him, dragging herself across the hard member.</p><p>\u201cI am\u2026 Captain America after all.\u201d A shallow moan followed another thrust and he grabbed the condom next to the pillow, ripping the package and handing it to her.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t the poor the guy a virgin though? Did the whole beefcake flavored popsicle thing before he could get the girl?\u201d Lucy scooted back just enough to free him from under her, spreading the wetness she left on his throbbing cock before rolling the latex down.</p><p>He bent her down by her shoulders, bracing one arm around her waist while the other holds her close, hands gripping her neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna pretend you just didn\u2019t call Cap a virgin beefcake flavored popsicle, alright?\u201d He preened when she giggled and it occurred to him how much time had passed since sex was this poignant and so carefree at the same time. Lucy brought a whole new game to the table; sexy, fun, extremely hot and addictive, just like her.</p><p>He ran his nose on the thick vein there, kissing up to her ear, nibbling on the flesh. \u201cCan I fuck you now little rabbit?\u201d</p><p>God how he loved how he could make her body flush and shiver with just a few words. Chris&rsquo; lips covered hers in a scorching kiss, tongues clashing before Lucy righted her body and positioned herself over him.</p><p>\u201cI believe,\u201d she hissed as Chris pinched her nipples, \u201cI believe I\u2019m the one doing the fucking now.\u201d</p><p>Hungry eyes met as she eased down on him, never breaking eye contact till she is flushed on his lap, throwing her head back with a lustful moan.</p><p>\u201cGod Chris, I\u2019m so full of you.\u201d She stilled for a moment, getting used to the sensation.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so tight baby, I can feel every bit of your pussy hugging me.\u201d He moaned breathily when she squeezed him, hands flying to her thighs and rear. \u201cYou gonna wreck me just by doing that and then you won\u2019t get to cum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t have that now, can we?\u201d Lucy rolled her hips in a slow movement, keeping most of his cock inside her as she rocked side to side, smiling provocatively at the groans coming from Chris.</p><p>Hands sprawled over his large chest as leverage, Lucy impressed a hard pace, pulling all the way up and slamming back down with slow circles that had her eyes rolling to the back of her head, the head of Chris\u2019 cock hitting her g-spot with every downward movement.</p><p>Holding the soft flesh on the back of her thighs, Chris met her thrusts with his own, grinding her down on his pelvis. He shifted so his feet were flat against the mattress, starting a pattern of quick and shallow thrusts that made Lucy drop her head to her heaving chest, her hair falling around them like a curtain as her hands clang to his shoulders, fingernails digging into the muscles, moaning and sobbing.</p><p>Walls clenching around him, he could sense that she was close, her mouth forming a delicate o shape, eyes closed in ecstasy. Every nerve ending is alive and bursting with energy, all connected to the spot where his cock entered her and she gasped, air heavily leaving her lungs when waves of pleasure crashed into her, chants of his name is like a song to his ears.</p><p>\u201cGod, Chris!\u201d She screamed his name, dropping to kiss him, her tongue sweeping over his. \u201cFuck, you make me feel so good.\u201d</p><p>Drawing circles up here sides, he held her closer, fingers flexing in her waist.</p><p>\u201cRabbit, we\u2019re barely getting started. On your back.\u201d Chris grunted as he lifted her, her juices making his cock glisten. \u201cFuck, look at that\u2026\u201d</p><p>He touched her slick clit when she settled on her back, making her shudder, aftershocks rocking her body with a strangled moan.</p><p>\u201cFucking gorgeous. Your body was made for me, to love it, to worship it. I\u2019m gonna fuck you so good baby.\u201d He got on his knees, bringing her hips level with his, propping her ass up with a discarded pillow.</p><p>\u201cChris, please. I need you.\u201d</p><p>The air is charged with the faint aroma of sex as Chris hovers over her. The caveman inside his brain growled with the need to possess her, make her theirs.</p><p>\u201cYou need my cock? You need me to pound you and make you forget your own name?\u201d His voice is hoarse with lust, eyes blown. He brought her legs up, resting her feet on his shoulders, his member nested on her folds. \u00a0\u201cI can do that rabbit, I\u2019ll fuck you raw, ruin you for anyone else but me. Do you want that?\u201d</p><p>He rocks against her, the crown of his shaft sliding over her clit and she keens, a high-pitched sound that snaps something inside him. He enters her roughly, bottoming out on the first thrust, establishing a hard pace. His moans echo around the room when he sees her holding her breasts, pinching her erect nipples.</p><p>\u201cI want that, yes, I want you. Fuck me, Chris, yes, yes.\u201d Wanton eyes look over at him and he almost lost it, driving into her with and making the headboard hit the wall in a staccato of thrusts.</p><p>One of her legs fell to the side when he let it go and it curled around his knees, keeping his vision unobstructed. Watching his cock disappear inside her is a glorious sight and Chris can barely tear his eyes away to look up, but he was glad he did. Lucy had her arms above her, head thrown to the side, eyes closed and her teeth are dug so hard into her lips he swore she would draw blood at any moment. Her labored breath and moans follow the rhythm of his hips and once in a while she would let a loud wail when he hit that perfect spot inside her.</p><p>The goosebumps are back, his brows furrowed and he had to fight to keep his eyes open, the pleasure coursing through him is too much.</p><p>\u201cEyes on me Lucy.\u201d Chris told her in a slow growl and smiled when dark green orbs focus on him. \u201cYou\u2019re the most beautiful thing in the world. I can feel you\u2019re close baby, cum for me.\u201d</p><p>A thumb is pressed to her clit, rubbing small circles on the hardened nub, propelling her to the end. Lucy gripped the sheets, back bowing from the mattress, calling for him as her body convulsed.</p><p>His own release is there, his powerful thighs clenching as his hips still, her name on his lips, a powerful climax washing over him.</p><p>Breathing heavily, Chris laid down on top of her, holding himself up in his forearms, searching her face only to find her smiling at him, a lazy grin that made his heart flutter.</p><p>\u201cThat was\u2026\u201d slender fingers pushed the sweaty hair out of his forehead and Lucy kissed his cheek, lips lingered on the scruff.</p><p>\u201cIntense? Incredible? Impeccable? Impressive? Illegal?\u201d Chris would have continued but her clasped hand in front of his mouth stopped him.</p><p>\u201cIllegal?\u201d Lucy laughed.</p><p>He licked her palm and she yelped, removing it quickly and giving him a dirty look. He grinned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it is somewhere, you were pretty loud after all.\u201d</p><p>He rolled over from her, leaving the bed to deal with the condom.</p><p>\u201cAnd whose fault is that <i>Mister Dirty Talk Extraordinaire</i>?\u201d She called after him.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m gonna feel guilty about making you scream my name?\u201d He gave her a skeptical look as he came back with a damp hand towel, running it carefully over her.</p><p>\u201cIncorrigible. There\u2019s another one for you.\u201d She stretched and Chris drank on her body. The sight of her naked and pliable in his bed was now ranked top ten in the list of his favorite things.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s play a game.&rdquo; Chris reclined on the headboard with his legs sprawled on the bed, white sheets covering his lower body. Lucy was on her stomach next to him, hands resting on her chin, feet up and crossed at the ankles, her naked form enticing him. His eyes followed the curves of her back, stopping to admire the tattoo that covered most of her right side, back dipping to form her waist before coming back up to the most amazing ass he&rsquo;d ever seem, and yes, he had seen more than most men. He needed a distraction otherwise he&rsquo;d pounce on her again. &ldquo;Two truths, one lie.&rdquo; When she looked at him quizzically, he explained, &ldquo;We each tell the other two truths about ourselves and make up a lie, a believable one. The other person has to guess what the lie is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do we get if we get the lie right?&rdquo; she rearranged herself on the bed and he groaned when the movements gave him a better look of her breasts. She caught the look on his eyes and smirked, wagging a finger at him. &ldquo;Bad Chris, stay down boy. Stopping ogling the girls.&rdquo; She giggled, looking around, finally grabbing a pillow that had been pushed to the edge of the bed and using it as a cover.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve turned me into a fiend, it&rsquo;s your own sexy fault.&rdquo; He pouted when the pillow obstructed the view and he drew a breath to try and clear his mind. A sly smile graced his face, he knew exactly what to bet on. &ldquo;How about this, three rounds. Winner gets to pick and plan a future date, loser can&rsquo;t say no to the date no matter what the plan is.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes got big when she understood exactly what that meant. <i>Yeah baby, you\u2019re not escaping so easily from me.</i></p><p>\u201cAnd I can plan any date I like? Picnic, fly a kite, bungee-jumping?\u201d she licked her lips, wide-eyed with all the possibilities but then hesitated, \u201cAre you even allowed to bungee-jump? I mean, don\u2019t you signed a contract stating you must look pretty and can\u2019t do anything that might break a bone and halt productions?\u201d</p><p>Chris threw his head back in laughter, this girl was amazing, so open and earnest, with no agenda, just a gorgeous girl genuinely interested in him.</p><p>\u201cKevin might have a problem with the last one, but sure, whatever you plan.\u201d He admitted, enthralled by the possibilities. A B&amp;B on a vineyard near the coast where they could spend the whole day naked and tangled in each other, only coming out to see the sun setting and to find a small restaurant to eat. A cabin in the woods, lots of pillows scattered around the floor in front of a crackling fireplace. A four-day weekend in Italy, sightseeing near Verona and Genova, drinking wine and holding hands without anyone bothering them. Any of the scenarios had amazing appeal, he just needed to make sure he\u2019d have a chance to make them come to life.</p><p>\u201cFine, let&rsquo;s play,\u201d she grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re going skinny dipping at Otsego Lake, just so you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that supposed to scare me? I\u2019d love to go skinny dipping with you.\u201d Chris waggled his eyebrow at her. \u201cHere&rsquo;s an easy one; I played quarterback in high school and we were county champions. My favorite color is blue but sky blue, like on a summer day. I once fooled my brother into peeing his own pants in front of our nanny.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Leave it to you to describe a color like you\u2019re in the middle of a romcom. That\u2019s one truth.&rdquo; She smiled when he nodded. &ldquo;Uhm. You&rsquo;re crazy about football and golly, could you ever be so mean? Yikes. But then again, you were banned from the museum\u2026&rdquo; She tapped her fingers to her mouth. &ldquo;Nah, you would\u2019ve told me that yesterday, so that\u2019s the lie, no one is that mean.&rdquo;</p><p>He made a horn-like sound, shouting &ldquo;WRONG!&rdquo;</p><p>\u201cWhat! Oh my god, you\u2019re a terrible person Christopher,\u201d her mouth drops in disbelief. \u201cYour poor, poor brother!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI truly was the worst brother ever when it came to pranks.\u201d He had a smirk on his face</p><p>\u201cRemind me to never go on a prank war with you, Mr. Evans. And here I am imagining you\u2019re star quarterback, getting all cozy with the head cheerleader and being crowned Prom King.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if. I was the scrawny kid from Drama Class, joined the lacrosse team to kiss up to dad. I was actually dumped at prom!\u201d At her incredulous face, he laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s true, we\u2019re at this party and she said I was too immature and deluded if I thought the acting gig would pay off. But I did get \u2018Most Likely to Die Doing Something Stupid\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she must hate herself right about now.\u201d Lucy chuckled. \u201cHave you ever saw her again after that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot personally, but she works at Lincoln-Sudbury High, Carly has told me she gloats that I took her to prom and never mentions that she left me alone to cry in my neighbor\u2019s front lawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cheekiness of the woman! Next time you do an interview, rattle her out, let\u2019s see how she feels about that.\u201d</p><p>Chris loved that she feels indignant on his behalf.</p><p>\u201cOkay, your turn little lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see. I\u2019m ambidextrous, my handwriting looks exactly the same no matter which hand I use. \u00a0I was once part of a girl band named The Fantastic Four, no correlation to your movie at all. I\u2019m terrified of clowns to the point of hyperventilating.\u201d</p><p>The grin on his face was almost maniacal. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to plan our date.\u201d</p><p>She eyed him with distrust. \u201cNo way you know it that easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, you think I don\u2019t know you usurped the girl band story from Penny?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped. \u201cNO! How could you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually pure dumb luck and the fact that I have a great memory.\u201d He confessed. \u201cA bunch of us went to Mayfair at Harvard Square back in May and they had a food truck called The Fantastic Flour. I tried my best to ignore the jokes and steered clear of the place. Penny, on the other hand, insisted it was destiny and told us about her garage band. For some reason, it stuck with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no fun!\u201d She complained with a smile. \u201cThat was my best fake story, I can\u2019t bluff to save my life!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must suck at poker then,\u201d Chris smirked. \u201cNext time we\u2019re playing strip-poker.\u201d</p><p>She laughed long and hard before he pounced on her, throwing the pillow she was using to cover herself to the side of the bed and dragging her naked body on top of his, tickling her sides. They tumbled around in the bed, sharing a long kiss and Chris saw the moment her pupils dilated. God, he wanted to have her again, she was an addiction he could freely partake in but now wasn\u2019t the time. No, there are things that need to be discussed, they couldn\u2019t spend these few hours fucking each other, as lovely as that thought was.</p><p>\u201cHow about we go see if that omelet is still warm enough?\u201d He helped her up from the bed, giving her a terry cloth robe that was way to bigger for her and put it on another one.</p><p>\u201cThank you for coming back home with me last night. I\u2019ve had more fun in the past two days than most of this past year.\u201d He hugged her after tying a loose knot on the robe.</p><p>\u201cThank you for asking me to come back.\u201d She cupped his cheek and stroked his beard. \u201cI really liked spending time with you, Chris. Us meeting was the highlight of a somewhat insipid year.\u201d</p><p>A deer in headlights. That was most likely the look he sported now. He knew this conversation was coming, but still, he dreaded it.</p><p>\u201cUhm. About that. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>-.-.-.-.-.-.-</p><p>One cold Spanish Omelet and three cups of coffee later, Chris and Lucy sat on the family room sofa. He lounged lazily on the chase with Lucy laying down across him, her head on his lap. His phone was docked on the side table, Christmas music coming from hidden speakers around the living room, Chris had turned on the lights of his Christmas tree and the twinkling lights played around them.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay about the whole blind date thing?\u201d Chris inquired, slowly combing her hair, a small gesture he was learning she loved and he enjoyed doing it for her.</p><p>\u201cDo I still want to kill Penny? Sure do. I might push her from our dock into the frozen waters of Otsego lake at least once while we\u2019re back home but I know her heart was in the right place. She was right, I wouldn\u2019t have come if she told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why not? Was the idea of meeting me that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Lucy cradled the hand that rested on her belly but didn\u2019t look up at him. \u201cI have a less than stellar record with men and although these past years have been rather lonely, I welcomed it, it was better than putting myself out there just to get shot down again. I didn\u2019t bother looking and I got rather creative at avoiding my friends meddling in my non-existent love life. They tried to set me up with people before, Terry even asked me if I had changed sides, and the next time we hung out he introduced me to Lauren and hightailed out of there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d He pulled on her hair, bringing her eyes to his. \u201cSo, you and Lauren\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your mind out of the gutter Christopher, nothing happened. She\u2019s a lovely girl, but I\u2019m not bi. We had a few drinks, plotted to kill Terry and parted ways as good friends. She\u2019s married now, her wife is pregnant. It\u2019s a little boy by the way.\u201d Lucy fetched her phone from the coffee table and opened Instagram, showing him a post about a week old.</p><p>\u201cLauren is the brunette?\u201d She nodded and Chris looked at another picture. \u201cWell damn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re imagining it, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry baby, I\u2019m a man after all.\u201d He gave her a very unapologetic grin when she snatched the phone out of his hand. His eyes searched hers and he was serious when he spoke. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had such terrible experiences with dating before. But I\u2019m glad you decided to come to Boston.\u201d</p><p>She smiled radiantly at him.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>They were silent but for Sinatra singing about a white Christmas and Dean Martin crying about letting it snow. Well, he had gotten his wish about half an hour ago, the streets were once again covered in white fluff, thick flocks hitting the large windows panels.</p><p>\u201cI have a really important question for you,\u201d Chris said, stopping the slow massage of her scalp.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026 Okay?\u201d Lucy studied his face, looking for a clue of what that question could be.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen the ring?\u201d He questioned with a serious expression.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, the ring! No, Garret wouldn\u2019t show it to me! It\u2019s on my travel bag and I\u2019m not even allowed to look at it. He actually used that word.\u201d She huffed.</p><p>\u201cCan you believe he wouldn\u2019t show it to me? I\u2019m his best friend, I should at least get a peak before the big day.\u201d Chris trailed off. \u201cOkay, maybe not, but I\u2019m so curious, he wouldn\u2019t tell me anything besides it\u2019s from Tiffany.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked me about Penny\u2019s preferences, so I\u2019m guessing it might be a gold band with a central round diamond in a solitaire style, but Garret would not confirm even that for me. I know he wants Penny to see it before anyone else but come on, gimme the deets, brah!\u201d They laughed together and Chris ribbed her for her terrible Boston accent.</p><p>\u201cGarret\u2019s my best friend. He\u2019s been there for me since my first year of high school, he believed in me when I didn\u2019t.\u201d His forehead creased. \u201cShe\u2019ll say yes, right? I mean, you\u2019re her sister, you must know whether Penny might say yes or no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I know she\u2019ll say yes?\u201d Lucy lifted his shoulder in a half shrug. \u00a0\u201cI mean, I can\u2019t know for sure that a hundred percent Chris, but she\u2019s absolutely and irrevocably in love with Garret since maybe their second date. She called me after he dropped her off and we spent two hours talking, which basically consisted of Penny praising Garret from his eyes to the way he would treat the staff at the restaurant.\u201d Happiness swelled within her when she remembered how excited Penny sounded on the phone.<i> I\u2019m gonna marry him someday babyboo, I just know that</i>. \u201cDo I believe she won\u2019t let him finish the proposal before she starts screaming yes? Absolutely!\u201d</p><p>Chris massaged the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cGod, you scared me for half a second.\u201d Chris chuckled before continuing. \u201cHe was insufferable during the first few months. We\u2019re all over Europe to promote the first Avengers and I asked both him and Guillermo to come with me, so they could keep me company and I wouldn\u2019t be so strung out with anxiety. Garret would get up at 2 am whenever we were so he could call Penny when she got back from work, or she would call him at 5 am her time while we\u2019re pausing for lunch. I told Garret to fly her to Paris so they could meet, impress her with a date on a caf\u00e9 near the Eiffel Tower and she said no, that they weren\u2019t at that point in their relationship yet. That\u2019s when I knew Penny would be perfect for Garret, she wasn\u2019t easily impressed by what his money could buy her. He told me once her favorite type of date included coffee and sitting on a park bench watching their dogs play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad made a point to always impart on us that you shouldn\u2019t measure a person by their wealth but on how well they treat those who do not share it,\u201d Lucy told him. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy to become jaded and lose perspective of how to be a decent human being when you don\u2019t know what it is to struggle to make ends meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d the twinkly lights were playing tricks with her hair, the bright shades of red tangling from Chris&rsquo; fingers. He paused to rearrange the strands falling over her eyes, carefully tucking it behind her ears. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m a conceited prick or that my ego needs its own zip code or something but aside from that the various quips about my acting, you never once mentioned me being, well, me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you wanted me to?\u201d Lucy had a hand softly stroking Dodger\u2019s auburn coat while the pooch lay on the floor next to them, his head rolling back and forth after her hand. Her eyes focused on his, studying him. \u201cDid you want me to fangirl and be all over the great Chris Evans, Actor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Must definitely not.\u201d His left hand grabbed hers and brought it to his mouth, lightly kissing her knuckles, drawing in a breath. \u201cIt got harder to make friends or date people outside the industry since Captain America. I knew that would happen, but it sucks sometimes you know? I really don\u2019t like dating actress but\u2026 it\u2019s easier, less messy if you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarret once commented you got really good at smelling fakers.\u201d Lucy sat back up and faced Chris, pulling her legs close to her chest, head resting on her knees.</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s a skill you need to hone very quickly otherwise you\u2019ll live in a world full of people trying to blow smoke up your ass to get something from you. You see this person you want to interact with, be it a girl you wanna hook up with or this dude who talks beer and artisanal cheese and maybe could be a friend, you know, and you approach them, you wanna get to know them, but the minute they see the actor, Chris disappears and Chris Evans, must take his place. That had been my life up to two nights ago. Then you appear and while you did acknowledge the actor, you brushed past him and went straight to Chris.\u201d He got a hold of her hand before continuing, \u201cWe met and didn\u2019t talk much before we were all over each other, and can you really blame me for that? \u2018Cuz look at you\u2026 But when we did talk, you busted my chops about football, you weren\u2019t afraid to tell me to shut up when I needed to, and I fucking loved that, it\u2019s been a while since a girl called me on my shit.\u201d</p><p>She held her right hand over her heart and raised the left one, \u201cI, Lucy Seabrook, hereby promise to always call you on your shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways, huh? That sounds awful like you\u2019d want to spend more time with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I\u2019ve been smitten with you for quite some time Chris.\u201d At his puzzled face, she continued. \u201cAlthough I\u2019ve never come to visit Penny in Boston, she\u2019s been plenty of times to New York. At first, she\u2019d come with a couple of friends, or we\u2019d get together with my friends and consume a lot of alcohol and enjoy a hell of a good time. And one day instead of a couple of girlfriends, she brought Garret. Just a friend, you know, nothing to see here, she said that shit every other phone call, but I knew better. Anyways, Garret had this friend, Chris. And Chris is the coolest guy on the planet; they went snowboarding, they went to Walt Disney World with his family, they went to Vegas and had a hell of good time\u2026 Chris couldn\u2019t be around much, but he was a bro like no other. Garret respects and admires you like a true brother by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mutual,\u201d Chris crossed his leg and turned to her, waiting.</p><p>\u201cSo Chris is a constant on your life even though you never met him; he\u2019s now in the stories your sister tells you as well, he helps at Christopher\u2019s Heaven, donates a good chunk of money to the place. Of course, you\u2019ve seen pictures of everyone, and the guy in the left holding a beer or making a face, that\u2019s Chris, such a fun and down to earth guy, such a great outlook on life. And then one day you\u2019re watching Game of Thrones with your sister and her boyfriend, and hey, isn\u2019t that a tv spot from Winter Soldier? The Captain America guy kinda looks like your friend Chris, Gar and OH.\u201d She shook her head sheepishly. \u201cI fell for you before I met you. Not with the actor, but this great guy named Chris, who happens to act and plays Captain Steve Rogers now and then, who\u2019s friends with my sister and her boyfriend. It does help that he\u2019s crazy good in bed and damn, can make me weak on the knees just by kissing my neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrazy good in bed, huh?\u201d Cupping her face, he softly kisses her lips, hands coaxing her body towards him. Opening her legs, Lucy straddles Chris\u2019 lap, her shirt riding up to expose her bottom and Chris moans when she rubs against his cock through the thin lace and cotton barriers.</p><p>She giggled then, a beautiful sound that made his warmed his whole body. He needed to make sure this was just the first of many, many dates. Chris leaned closer, lips gently brushing hers. He enveloped her small hands with his large ones.</p><p>\u201cI live a hectic life.\u201d His eyes turned serious and he saw a look of worry cross her face. \u201cI can be gone for months at times, sometimes with no break at all. I\u2019m an asshole sometimes, scratch that, most of the time. I\u2019m no prize Lucy, but I really, really wanna see you again.\u201d</p><p>A smile tucked at the corner of her lips, freeing one hand and running her index finger along his forehead, smoothing a frown line that he didn\u2019t know he sported.</p><p>\u201cYou might not believe you are blue ribbon material Chris, but it\u2019s part of my job to judge talents when I encounter them and you, my dear, deserve first place in a lot of categories.\u201d The tips of his ears felt hot at her praise. \u201cI\u2019m hard headed and a workaholic, I spend over eighty hours teaching and training and my brother calls me a mule, that\u2019s how stubborn I am. Having said that, I really, really wanna see you again as well.\u201d</p><p>Chris let of a breath he didn\u2019t know he was holding, a big smile on his face, bringing her close for a hug.</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m blue ribbon material you say?\u201d he moved back to look at her, raising one eyebrow suggestively and tickling her side. \u201cCan I see the judges notes, please? I need to know what my strengths were and where I need to improve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop, stop!\u201d her giggles filled the room and he thought they were the cutest thing. \u201cYou\u2019re such a polpetto Chris!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a polpetto si, a meatball ah?,\u201d his Italian accent sucked, but she laughed harder when he closed his hands in the traditional Italian gesture and shook them exclaiming, \u201cDio santo!\u201d</p><p>She rested her forehead on his naked chest, a hand coming up to trace his clavicle tattoo.</p><p>\u201cIs that all the Italian you know, caro mio?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s about it.\u201d Skilled fingers unbuttoned the shirt she wore, parting the sides to unveil her breasts. His palmed the globes, thumbs skimming the quickly hardening nipples. \u201cWe used to pester Uncle Mike for curse words, but he always told us vaffanculo, so that\u2019s the only one I know.\u201d</p><p>She planted small kisses on his tattoo, the tip of her tongue tracing the words, fingering his pebbled nipples. \u201cVoglio le tue mani su tutto il corpo e la tua testa fra le gambe. Ti piace cozi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what you just said but bring it on baby.\u201d Lucy yelped when his strong hands picked her from his lap and laid her back on the couch, opening her legs with his knees to rest his pelvis against her, a hiss escaping her when his covered cock made contact with her mound. \u201cBring it on.\u201d</p><p>__________________________________________</p><p>\n\nNotes:</p><p>Polpetto \u2013 meatball</p><p>Dio Santo \u2013 oh my god.

            "comment": "<p>Chris woke around 8 am, alone in bed and for a moment he panicked, thinking Lucy never actually came home with him last night. A look around the room revealed her suitcase and a large soft luggage bag neatly stacked near his closet, her purse on the nearby chair. The pillow he was hugging still smelled like her shampoo and he smiled at the memory of them showering together and how he had insisted on washing her hair, his hands working the long strands into different hairstyles while she laughed at his portray of a flamboyant hairdresser.</p>[[MORE]]<p>They\u2019d arrived home around 8 pm after Garret read him the riot act while Lucy gathered her stuff. <i>He\u2019d better not fuck this up, was he sure he wanted to pursue this? Otherwise he better end their date right there.</i></p><p>Date. Chris scoffed at the word. He was sure Lucy still didn\u2019t know the meeting at the game was a set-up arranged by her sister and his best friend; a blind date where only one of them knew they were on a date at all. Penny insisted Lucy wouldn\u2019t come if she were to tell her and it was up to Chris to make the move.</p><p>Ever since he wrapped Gifted and came back home complaining he had had enough of the Hollywood dating scene, Penny redoubled her efforts to get Chris and Lucy together. <i>\u201cShe\u2019s the sweetest girl, Chris, always there with a smile when I was hurt. She was the first to organize a fundraising and collecting food and clothes after the Mitchell\u2019s house fire. She\u2019s got the biggest heart of anyone I know and they abused her trust. She\u2019s been hurt pretty and she\u2019s afraid of trying again. I believe you can change that.\u201d</i> Penny said over pizza one day. Chris had his doubts, not sure if he was ready to deal with so much baggage. <i>\u201cWould you date her?\u201d</i> Chris asked Garret over beers, <i>\u201cShe\u2019s fragile man but she\u2019s a special girl. Hell yes, I\u2019d date her. She\u2019s wicked smart, sassy as hell and can make you laugh like a lunatic plus, she\u2019s built like a fifties pin-up girl, all tits, ass, and thighs. You keep saying you want something real, here\u2019s your chance at it.\u201d</i></p><p>So Chris agreed to the date, picking a football game for their first meeting, a common ground where both could still enjoy themselves if the chemistry wasn\u2019t there. Except they hit it off so good that any plans of taking her out for dinner so they could get to know each flew out of the window and now he was working backward to convince her she was more than a one-night stand.</p><p>The moment he left the bedroom Chris could hear Lucy singing downstairs. She wasn\u2019t going to win any Grammys but she wasn\u2019t bad either. He made his way downstairs carefully as to not alert her of his presence.</p><p>He stopped just before reaching the bottom, watching as Lucy belted the lyrics to an old pop song into a wooden spoon, moving around the kitchen with her eyes closed during the chorus. He watched as she opened and closed his cabinets, a quiet yay reaching his ears when she found a glass bowl, bringing the bowl with her back to the counter where eggs, cheese, sliced potatoes, and condiments all waited. And since when did he own a cast iron pan?</p><p>Lucy sang and danced while she mixed the ingredients, pouring them into the hot pan, her oversized nightshirt hanging loosely on her shoulders, purplish marks dotting her neck. He\u2019d never been one to leave them before but with her he was a man possessed, staking a claim so everyone could see she belonged with him. A twinge of jealousy hit him at the thought of a man getting closer enough to look at her neck.</p><p>Chris knew it was probably too early to feel that way but he wasn\u2019t concerned with a timetable any more. He\u2019d been infatuated with the idea of her for the past month and the reality turned out to be so much better. Their time at the museum yesterday had been fantastic, no awkward silences, no lulls in the conversation. He hanged into her every word, committing to memory every like and dislike she shared, wanting to know everything about the firecracker redhead who danced her way into his life.</p><p>He leaned against the fridge, crossing his arms.</p><p>\u201cIs there a cover fee for the show or is it included with breakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat depends, what kind of payment are we talking about?\u201d Lucy smiled brightly at him, rinsing her hands.</p><p>\u201cI can think of a few ways. I\u2019m also known for being a very generous tipper.\u201d</p><p>Chris walked over to her, picking up a napkin and drying each individual finger before bringing her hands over his neck, leaning down to gently kiss her.</p><p>\u201cTop o\u2019 the mornin\u2019 to ya, little lady.\u201d He smiled at her when their lips separated, tipping an imaginary hat at her.</p><p>\u201cMornin\u2019 sir,\u201d she giggled and did a little curtsy. \u201cGive it 25 minutes and you\u2019ll eat the best Spanish omelet of your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving so it better be good.\u201d Chris challenged, letting go of her to fill Dodger\u2019s food and water bowl.</p><p>\u201cOf your life.\u201d She pointed the wood spoon at his retrieving back.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very tall order little lady, I\u2019ve been alive for quite some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept that, I\u2019m older than you.\u201d She reminded Chris while she brought the coffee pot and the juice jar to the small breakfast table by the window.</p><p>\u201cYou know what that makes you, right?\u201d He called back to her, already on his way back from the laundry room.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She moved back to the counter, checking on the food on the stovetop, turning it off and moving the pan to the oven.</p><p>\u201cA cougar.\u201d He said was behind her, hands circling her waist and bringing her body close to his, his lips closing on the pulse point on her neck and effectively ending the protest on her lips. \u201cA very fine,\u201d kiss, \u201cgorgeous,\u201d bite, \u201cbeautiful cougar.\u201d</p><p>He sucked the tender skin where her neck met her shoulder, leaving yet another mark.</p><p>\u201cKeep that up and I\u2019ll need a scarf inside the house when I get to my parent\u2019s,\u201d she made no movement to stop him, hands resting over his.</p><p>\u201cYou have a very biteable neck.\u201d Chris kissed the same spot again just to prove a point and she giggled. \u201cI\u2019ll try to curb my inner vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour inner vampire is quite welcome to other places where I can better hide the evidence.\u201d Lucy looked back up to him, a hint of mischievousness in her voice.</p><p>His hands immediately moved to cup her breasts over her shirt. \u201cOh, you mean here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhm\u2026 or here.\u201d Lucy\u2019s hand gently guided him to the inside of her thighs.</p><p>\u201cYour idea is so much better than mine.\u201d Chris turned her around and his mouth immediately found hers in a powerful and possessive kiss.</p><p>He was rapidly becoming addicted to her mouth, her lips moving like fine silk on his, tongue searching for him, a delirious chase he couldn\u2019t get enough of. He heard her moan against his mouth and it stoked the fire already burning inside of him.</p><p>Chris\u2019 strong hands clutched Lucy\u2019s waist, bringing her closer to his body and in a swift movement he lifted and dropped her at the counter, her body bouncing when she landed.</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy, you could throw your back or someth\u2026\u201d</p><p>His lips quickly silenced her words and he nipped at her for good measure when they separated.</p><p>\u201cI can bench press over 300 pounds Lucy, and you weigh what, a bit more than half that? Let me worry about what I can and I can\u2019t handle,\u201d his hands slid up her thighs till he finds the white lace cheeky panties she wore, thumbs hooking around the lace and pulling them down as he whispered in her ear. \u201cI love how my hands are full of you when I run them up your thighs, when I grab your ass, how your breasts feel heavy on my hands\u2026 and just so you know I\u2019d love to fuck them.\u201d</p><p>A strangled moan escaped her at his words and she reached for his sweatpants, pushing them down, needing the contact, craving the feel of him. He rocked his hips on her, the head of his cock right on top of her clit, his bare length sliding up and down over her small lips, coating himself in her juices. \u201cI want you inside me, Chris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh, I\u2019m not finished. Trivia time. Did you know I had a crush on Jessica Rabbit the first time I saw Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\u201d Chris unbuttons her shirt, bottom to top, slowly unwrapping her like a present, thrusting against her with each new inch of skin he reveals, her moans spurring him on. \u201cTo my twelve-year-old self, she was the hottest woman I\u2019d ever seen, who cares if she was a cartoon. It was the first time I actively jerked off.\u201d He parted the sides of her nightgown, exposing her breast and he licks his lips at the sight of her naked chest. His hands tangle in her hair bringing the red strands around her left shoulder. Her eyes are blown, pupils dilated, almost no green left and he thinks she looked like a fucking goddess at that moment. He stood between her legs, his nose skimming the pulse point on her neck, lips following suit, before stepping back, making her pout for the lack of contact. \u201cGod, look at you, my personal Jessica Rabbit, pouty lips and all, my fucking wet dream coming true, sinful curves and deliciously naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen come here and fuck your Rabbit,\u201d she pulled him back, mouths clashing, tongues dancing together. Her hands roamed over the taut muscles of his arms, tracing the veins and kneading the flesh of his shoulders, fingertips caressing the nape of his neck with one hand while the other danced on the planes of his chest, following the trail of hair that led to his cock.</p><p>Lucy planted open-mouthed kisses on his chest, gently biting his right nipple, sucking the small hard nub in her mouth, enthralled by the sounds he made.</p><p>\u201cFuck, do that again,\u201d Chris asked in a low voice and she smiled against his chest, moving to the other side. She flattened her tongue against his nipple before closing her mouth against it, teeth rasping the pebbled skin and sucking hard and at the same time that she closed her hand over him, dragging her fingers over the crown in slow but precise motions. A guttural moan rocked his body and he thrust hard against her hand, pre-come leaking from the bulbous head.</p><p>\u201cHow did you like it?\u201d Lucy grinned up to him, hand fisting over his shaft as she licked around the tattoo on his ribcage.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2026 god, don\u2019t tease,\u201d he faltered when her fingers squeezed around him, both hands working in a precise rhythm. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely going into the pro column.\u201d</p><p>Her laugh is cut short when he pulls her hair back, covering her mouth with his. Their kisses became long and slow, fueled by their moans, tongues sinfully dancing together as hands travel everywhere; caressing her boobs, touching his ass, tangled in her hair, gripping his waist.</p><p>\u201cLay back on your arms.\u201d Chris nudges her back with a soft touch and she obeys, releasing his shaft and arranging herself on the black marble. Fingers and mouth working together, he traces a pattern over her body, stroking over her collarbone, rolling her nipples between expert fingers, dipping his tongue on her belly button. He nips at the small curve of her belly, biting and bruising the skin and smirks at her. \u201cNo one will see this one, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsidering it\u2019s not exactly swimming weather outside, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d she smiled and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he rubbed his bearded face on her inner thighs. \u201cI\u2019m not finished though.\u201d</p><p>Warm open-mouthed kisses on the inside of her thighs left her panting and pleading for more.</p><p>\u201cUse your words, Lucy.\u201d His warm breath tickled her lips, making her squirm.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tease me like that.\u201d Wild eyes glanced down, \u201cI want your mouth on me. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, madam.\u201d The feel of his silky tongue made her whole body undulate, a loud gasp echoing in the large room as he bathed her in slow and sure motions. He gave her a wicked grin before his lips closed on her clit, tongue swirling on the taut nerve and her hips lifted, legs jumping wildly. He hooked her left leg over his shoulder for anchorage, grasping the curve of her hips to keep her from moving and her small hand covered his, fingers tangling together. Chris smiled, eyes framed by long eyelashes looking up to her, loving to watch her surrender under his touch. He was lost to the scent of her, the sweet and tangy aroma filling his lungs.</p><p>\u201cChris.\u201d A gasp escaped her swollen lips, eyes fluttering close with each pass of his tongue, shallow breaths, and a racing heart.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re beautiful,\u201d His mouth barely leaves her to whisper his adoration. \u201cAre you ready for more baby?\u201d</p><p>Two fingers sank into her, scissoring and curling against her walls. He devoured her, lips and tongue working her clit, fingers hooked inside her, rubbing that sweet spot inside her over and over. Her hips thrust wildly upward, incomprehensible cries falling from her lips when he sped up his motions, humming his praise, the vibrations on causing the most delicious electric sparks making her legs writhe and sending her dangerously close to the edge.</p><p>Her body grew taut, goosebumps spreading all over and he felt her clenching his fingers, fingernails leaving small crescent shapes on the back of his hand before releasing his hand and threading them around his hair, keeping him where she needed the most.</p><p>\u201cSo close, oh god, I need\u2026 close.\u201d</p><p>His teeth scraped her clit and it\u2019s her undoing. Lucy cried out to him, tremors rocking her, legs quivering as he continued to touch her, transforming her orgasm in an ongoing sensation that washed over her back and forth every time his tongues her clit, fingers still moving inside her now with a renewed fervor.</p><p>\u201cGive one more baby, I know you have it in you.\u201d Another pair of fingers made contact with her clit, rubbing it in a maddening pace as he kisses her inner thighs, bruising the skin with his teeth. He slipped his fingers from inside her pussy, digits coated in her cum, and moved them lower, pressing them lightly against her puckered hole, making contact hard enough to let her know he\u2019s there. His tongue enters her, lapping up the escaping slick as his index fingers breached the impossibly tight hole.</p><p>\u201cChris, oh god, oh f\u2026\u201d a second wave hit her and her arm gave out, spasm taking over her body and her eyes rolled to the back of her head, the fire never ending, the darkness threatening to take over.</p><p>She pushed him away, her body spent as she laid on the counter, breathing heavily.</p><p>\u201cFuck, you look gorgeous when you cum,\u201d Chris\u2019 eyes were zeroed on hers with a smug smile on his face, fingers slowly caressing the skin of her hips. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a moment, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m alive,\u201d Lucy closed her eyes, drawing a deep breath, the sound of his laugh making her smile. \u201cYep, I\u2019m alive.\u201d</p><p>Chris pulled her up and her hands immediately gravitated to his face, bringing him close, kissing his shiny lips, thumbing the moisture on his mustache and bringing it to her mouth, her tongue making a show of licking the digit clean, groaning at the taste of herself on him. He moaned and rocked himself against her core, callused hands curling on the skin of her bottom.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Lucy nuzzled his neck, kissing the smooth skin, her nose pressed on his beard, \u201cI\u2019ve never let anyone back there before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever?\u201d the whimper is followed by a grunt when she shook her head. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready, let me know, I can make you feel so, so good baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about I think about it and I get back to you on that.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause before he agreed and dove for her mouth, tongues dueling in a heated kiss, hissing when her hands closed around him, sliding up and down the length with torturous gestures.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never wanted anyone the way I want you,\u201d her hands stroked and twisted, creating the perfect amount of pressure that forced him to thrust back searching for more friction. Lucy nibbled his earlobe and murmured, \u201cGet inside me Chris, now.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a command he\u2019s eager to obey and he brings her closer to the edge of the counter, dragging his cock up her slit, making them both moan.</p><p>And then he stopped, looking around for a moment, groaning.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>His low curse made her head pop. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t bring any condoms down with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d The disbelief in her voice made him chuckle.</p><p>More expletives left his mouth as he opened a few drawers before finally admitting defeat with a shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cWell little rabbit, for starters my pants didn\u2019t have any pockets. Plus, I didn\u2019t exactly plan on fucking you on my counter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so sturdy though, it just begs for some action.\u201d She bounces a little, grinning at him.</p><p>Chris threw his head back with a laugh, raising both eyebrows at her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re using me for my kitchen, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, I\u2019ve been found,\u201d she snapped her fingers with a mocking frown.</p><p>\u201cCome on woman, let\u2019s go upstairs before\u2026\u201d</p><p>The oven pinged, signaling the food was ready.</p><p>\u201cThat.\u201d Chris dropped his head on her shoulder while Lucy tried to contain her mirth, certain he would not appreciate her laughing right now.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Lucy glanced from the oven back to him, fingers dancing between the hairs of his chest. \u201cI\u2019m alright with re-heated food if you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank fuck.\u201d He promptly hoisted her out of the counter, pausing just long enough to pick up his pants from the floor, just to look up and see her running up the stairs.</p><p>Lucy stopped on the middle step, shedding her shirt, calling out to him with her fingers. She squeaked and ran when Chris started after her, taking the steps two at a time, catching up to her right by his bedroom door, caging her body with his.</p><p>\u201cGotcha.\u201d Her whole skin prickled with his whisper and she couldn\u2019t help the moan that escaped when he bit her earlobe, tugging on the flesh. The feel of him rocking against her as he kissed the back of her neck reduced her to a quivering mess as he opened the door, directing her to the recently made bed.</p><p>Spinning in his arms, she kissed him hard, forcing his body toward the bed. \u201cLay down, keep your hands above your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBossy, bossy,\u201d Chris kissed her before laying down, making a show of shaking his ass at her, which earned him a playful swat. \u201cCareful with the merchandise woman.\u201d</p><p>Lucy giggle-snorted, shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ll handle all the packages with care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee that you do.\u201d He winked and got comfortable, holding onto the pillow under his head, licking his lips when she crawled over him, kneeling between his legs.</p><p>Her lips brushed over his brow, nose, and cheeks before touching his mouth, a pink tongue tracing his pouty lips. They kissed with their eyes open, Chris trying to follow her every time she retreated, only to kiss him again when his head hit the pillow with a growl.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be mean. I love kissing you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes crinkled, a smile tugging at the corner of her lips. The next time she didn\u2019t pull back, her tongue tangling with his, lips synced in a slow and sensuous dance, making his body buckle when she sucked his tongue, knuckles white from clutching the pillow.</p><p>She teased his neck, caressing the pulse point with her tongue, working her way down his body and Chris felt like fire wafted over his skin with each touch. Stopping over his dusky nipples, she replayed the earlier actions, this time with more teeth and Chris decided the move deserved a whole new column titled \u2018fucking brilliant\u2019. \u00a0</p><p>The hard muscles of his abdomen twitched when her teeth made contact, and she soothed him with butterfly kisses over the tattoo on his lower rib cage. The first dip of her tongue into his belly button bucked his hips, the anticipation consuming him as she licked over the thick line of hair connecting to the base of his cock, her nose nuzzling the velvet skin that rested over his lower abdomen.</p><p>\u201cLucy\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatience Chris.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to wait long, a hitched breath meeting the first touch of her tongue on the underside of his erection. She tempted him with one long lick before enveloping the head with her lips, tonguing the slit and tasting the drops of his salty pre-come already there.</p><p>An ache formed deep in his belly when her hands closed around him, pumping up and down the thick member, a thumb pressing the vein on the underside with every downward stroke. She cupped his balls as her mouth descended on him, sucking him slowly into her mouth, working her way down.</p><p>Chris wanted so badly to touch her, to run his hands everywhere while she claimed him, but he was good with following orders. \u201cGod, you\u2019re killing me, Lucy, such a pretty and talented mouth you have, fuck, so good around my cock.\u201d He heard and felt her moaning around him, the humming adding to his pleasure, and when she hollowed her cheeks and took him all the way he cursed loudly, body shaking. \u201cPlease, please let me touch you gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>She let him go with a pop, swirling her tongue around the weeping head, flattening her tongue and dragging over his frenulum, wanton eyes, dark and needy, never leaving him when she nodded and took him back into her mouth, her lips sinking until he could feel the back of her throat, grunting and fighting the urge to thrust up. He ran his hands over her shoulders, gentle fingers cupping her cheek while she engulfed him, her nose pressed to the trimmed hairs of his groin.</p><p>His labored breaths were cut by deep moans, pleasure cursing through this body.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not gonna last, baby.\u201d</p><p>His hands now played with her hair, gathering it to a side, holding it atop of her head and finally settling with tangling it all in a ponytail so he could watch what her as she worked to bring him to climax. The need to thrust became unbearable, a scorching heat consuming and overwhelming his senses.</p><p>\u201cLet it go, Chris,\u201d she enticed him and he surrendered, plunging against her mouth, marveling at the feeling of her silky tongue working over him when he retreated.</p><p>Sheer pleasure consumed him, the ache in his belly spreading all over him and he barely had time to warm her of his impending climax. Lucy paid him no mind, lips tight around his cock while two fingers pressed down on the perineum and he lost it, swelling and coating the inside of her mouth, hands tight on her hair to keep her from moving.</p><p>She swallowed and he groaned loudly, curses and moans mixed together while he sang her praises, calling her name over and over. Chris twitched when Lucy licked him clean, letting him go with a final pat to the head of his cock. A smile played on her lips as she gave him a small kiss at the corner of his lips before resting her head on the nook of his neck.</p><p>Chris was quiet for a moment before he let out a whistle.</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>Her body shook with contained laughter.</p><p>\u201cThat good, huh?\u201d Lucy drew small patterns on his chest and he rejoiced in the feeling of being so close to her.</p><p>\u201cFuck yes.\u201d He slowly kissed her, his tongue exploring the swollen lips. A small peck to her nose and he released her.</p><p>A blissful silence fell over them, his hands combing the long locks as she did the same to his beard. They stayed like that for some time, until Chris spoke again.</p><p>\u201cDo you have the number for The New York Times?\u201d He asked with a serious expression.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you need it for?\u201d Lucy side-eyed Chris.</p><p>\u201cI want to take out an ad and tell all those fools in New York City how incredibly stupid they are for passing you over. Or I might do a full-page \u201cthank you\u201d for the exact same reason, I\u2019m still undecided.\u201d He twisted them both till she was laying on top of him, taking the opportunity to run his hands over her ribcage, waist and finally resting both hands on her bottom, holding them loosely over her flesh.</p><p>\u201cAll of this over a good blowjob?\u201d She chuckled and adjusted herself so her pussy hovered over his hardening cock.</p><p>He shook his head and poked her on the side.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, but being on the receiving end of said blowjob I think you meant fantastic. Curl your toes and scream yourself hoarse fantastic,\u201d he is delighted when a blush covered not only the face but her breasts as well. He licked his lips and bucked against her, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m definitely thanking them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour recovering time is quite a feat, Chris.\u201d Her hips rocked slowly against him and Lucy left a small sigh when her clit rubbed on the veiny member.</p><p>He tightened his hold on her buttocks as she danced wantonly over him, dragging herself across the hard member.</p><p>\u201cI am\u2026 Captain America after all.\u201d A shallow moan followed another thrust and he grabbed the condom next to the pillow, ripping the package and handing it to her.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t the poor the guy a virgin though? Did the whole beefcake flavored popsicle thing before he could get the girl?\u201d Lucy scooted back just enough to free him from under her, spreading the wetness she left on his throbbing cock before rolling the latex down.</p><p>He bent her down by her shoulders, bracing one arm around her waist while the other holds her close, hands gripping her neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna pretend you just didn\u2019t call Cap a virgin beefcake flavored popsicle, alright?\u201d He preened when she giggled and it occurred to him how much time had passed since sex was this poignant and so carefree at the same time. Lucy brought a whole new game to the table; sexy, fun, extremely hot and addictive, just like her.</p><p>He ran his nose on the thick vein there, kissing up to her ear, nibbling on the flesh. \u201cCan I fuck you now little rabbit?\u201d</p><p>God how he loved how he could make her body flush and shiver with just a few words. Chris\u2019 lips covered hers in a scorching kiss, tongues clashing before Lucy righted her body and positioned herself over him.</p><p>\u201cI believe,\u201d she hissed as Chris pinched her nipples, \u201cI believe I\u2019m the one doing the fucking now.\u201d</p><p>Hungry eyes met as she eased down on him, never breaking eye contact till she is flushed on his lap, throwing her head back with a lustful moan.</p><p>\u201cGod Chris, I\u2019m so full of you.\u201d She stilled for a moment, getting used to the sensation.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so tight baby, I can feel every bit of your pussy hugging me.\u201d He moaned breathily when she squeezed him, hands flying to her thighs and rear. \u201cYou gonna wreck me just by doing that and then you won\u2019t get to cum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t have that now, can we?\u201d Lucy rolled her hips in a slow movement, keeping most of his cock inside her as she rocked side to side, smiling provocatively at the groans coming from Chris.</p><p>Hands sprawled over his large chest as leverage, Lucy impressed a hard pace, pulling all the way up and slamming back down with slow circles that had her eyes rolling to the back of her head, the head of Chris\u2019 cock hitting her g-spot with every downward movement.</p><p>Holding the soft flesh on the back of her thighs, Chris met her thrusts with his own, grinding her down on his pelvis. He shifted so his feet were flat against the mattress, starting a pattern of quick and shallow thrusts that made Lucy drop her head to her heaving chest, her hair falling around them like a curtain as her hands clang to his shoulders, fingernails digging into the muscles, moaning and sobbing.</p><p>Walls clenching around him, he could sense that she was close, her mouth forming a delicate o shape, eyes closed in ecstasy. Every nerve ending is alive and bursting with energy, all connected to the spot where his cock entered her and she gasped, air heavily leaving her lungs when waves of pleasure crashed into her, chants of his name is like a song to his ears.</p><p>\u201cGod, Chris!\u201d She screamed his name, dropping to kiss him, her tongue sweeping over his. \u201cFuck, you make me feel so good.\u201d</p><p>Drawing circles up here sides, he held her closer, fingers flexing in her waist.</p><p>\u201cRabbit, we\u2019re barely getting started. On your back.\u201d Chris grunted as he lifted her, her juices making his cock glisten. \u201cFuck, look at that\u2026\u201d</p><p>He touched her slick clit when she settled on her back, making her shudder, aftershocks rocking her body with a strangled moan.</p><p>\u201cFucking gorgeous. Your body was made for me, to love it, to worship it. I\u2019m gonna fuck you so good baby.\u201d He got on his knees, bringing her hips level with his, propping her ass up with a discarded pillow.</p><p>\u201cChris, please. I need you.\u201d</p><p>The air is charged with the faint aroma of sex as Chris hovers over her. The caveman inside his brain growled with the need to possess her, make her theirs.</p><p>\u201cYou need my cock? You need me to pound you and make you forget your own name?\u201d His voice is hoarse with lust, eyes blown. He brought her legs up, resting her feet on his shoulders, his member nested on her folds. \u00a0\u201cI can do that rabbit, I\u2019ll fuck you raw, ruin you for anyone else but me. Do you want that?\u201d</p><p>He rocks against her, the crown of his shaft sliding over her clit and she keens, a high-pitched sound that snaps something inside him. He enters her roughly, bottoming out on the first thrust, establishing a hard pace. His moans echo around the room when he sees her holding her breasts, pinching her erect nipples.</p><p>\u201cI want that, yes, I want you. Fuck me, Chris, yes, yes.\u201d Wanton eyes look over at him and he almost lost it, driving into her with and making the headboard hit the wall in a staccato of thrusts.</p><p>One of her legs fell to the side when he let it go and it curled around his knees, keeping his vision unobstructed. Watching his cock disappear inside her is a glorious sight and Chris can barely tear his eyes away to look up, but he was glad he did. Lucy had her arms above her, head thrown to the side, eyes closed and her teeth are dug so hard into her lips he swore she would draw blood at any moment. Her labored breath and moans follow the rhythm of his hips and once in a while she would let a loud wail when he hit that perfect spot inside her.</p><p>The goosebumps are back, his brows furrowed and he had to fight to keep his eyes open, the pleasure coursing through him is too much.</p><p>\u201cEyes on me Lucy.\u201d Chris told her in a slow growl and smiled when dark green orbs focus on him. \u201cYou\u2019re the most beautiful thing in the world. I can feel you\u2019re close baby, cum for me.\u201d</p><p>A thumb is pressed to her clit, rubbing small circles on the hardened nub, propelling her to the end. Lucy gripped the sheets, back bowing from the mattress, calling for him as her body convulsed.</p><p>His own release is there, his powerful thighs clenching as his hips still, her name on his lips, a powerful climax washing over him.</p><p>Breathing heavily, Chris laid down on top of her, holding himself up in his forearms, searching her face only to find her smiling at him, a lazy grin that made his heart flutter.</p><p>\u201cThat was\u2026\u201d slender fingers pushed the sweaty hair out of his forehead and Lucy kissed his cheek, lips lingered on the scruff.</p><p>\u201cIntense? Incredible? Impeccable? Impressive? Illegal?\u201d Chris would have continued but her clasped hand in front of his mouth stopped him.</p><p>\u201cIllegal?\u201d Lucy laughed.</p><p>He licked her palm and she yelped, removing it quickly and giving him a dirty look. He grinned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it is somewhere, you were pretty loud after all.\u201d</p><p>He rolled over from her, leaving the bed to deal with the condom.</p><p>\u201cAnd whose fault is that <i>Mister Dirty Talk Extraordinaire</i>?\u201d She called after him.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m gonna feel guilty about making you scream my name?\u201d He gave her a skeptical look as he came back with a damp hand towel, running it carefully over her.</p><p>\u201cIncorrigible. There\u2019s another one for you.\u201d She stretched and Chris drank on her body. The sight of her naked and pliable in his bed was now ranked top ten in the list of his favorite things.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s play a game.\u201d Chris reclined on the headboard with his legs sprawled on the bed, white sheets covering his lower body. Lucy was on her stomach next to him, hands resting on her chin, feet up and crossed at the ankles, her naked form enticing him. His eyes followed the curves of her back, stopping to admire the tattoo that covered most of her right side, back dipping to form her waist before coming back up to the most amazing ass he\u2019d ever seem, and yes, he had seen more than most men. He needed a distraction otherwise he\u2019d pounce on her again. \u201cTwo truths, one lie.\u201d When she looked at him quizzically, he explained, \u201cWe each tell the other two truths about ourselves and make up a lie, a believable one. The other person has to guess what the lie is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we get if we get the lie right?\u201d she rearranged herself on the bed and he groaned when the movements gave him a better look of her breasts. She caught the look on his eyes and smirked, wagging a finger at him. \u201cBad Chris, stay down boy. Stopping ogling the girls.\u201d She giggled, looking around, finally grabbing a pillow that had been pushed to the edge of the bed and using it as a cover.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve turned me into a fiend, it\u2019s your own sexy fault.\u201d He pouted when the pillow obstructed the view and he drew a breath to try and clear his mind. A sly smile graced his face, he knew exactly what to bet on. \u201cHow about this, three rounds. Winner gets to pick and plan a future date, loser can\u2019t say no to the date no matter what the plan is.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes got big when she understood exactly what that meant. <i>Yeah baby, you\u2019re not escaping so easily from me.</i></p><p>\u201cAnd I can plan any date I like? Picnic, fly a kite, bungee-jumping?\u201d she licked her lips, wide-eyed with all the possibilities but then hesitated, \u201cAre you even allowed to bungee-jump? I mean, don\u2019t you signed a contract stating you must look pretty and can\u2019t do anything that might break a bone and halt productions?\u201d</p><p>Chris threw his head back in laughter, this girl was amazing, so open and earnest, with no agenda, just a gorgeous girl genuinely interested in him.</p><p>\u201cKevin might have a problem with the last one, but sure, whatever you plan.\u201d He admitted, enthralled by the possibilities. A B&amp;B on a vineyard near the coast where they could spend the whole day naked and tangled in each other, only coming out to see the sun setting and to find a small restaurant to eat. A cabin in the woods, lots of pillows scattered around the floor in front of a crackling fireplace. A four-day weekend in Italy, sightseeing near Verona and Genova, drinking wine and holding hands without anyone bothering them. Any of the scenarios had amazing appeal, he just needed to make sure he\u2019d have a chance to make them come to life.</p><p>\u201cFine, let\u2019s play,\u201d she grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re going skinny dipping at Otsego Lake, just so you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that supposed to scare me? I\u2019d love to go skinny dipping with you.\u201d Chris waggled his eyebrow at her. \u201cHere\u2019s an easy one; I played quarterback in high school and we were county champions. My favorite color is blue but sky blue, like on a summer day. I once fooled my brother into peeing his own pants in front of our nanny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave it to you to describe a color like you\u2019re in the middle of a romcom. That\u2019s one truth.\u201d She smiled when he nodded. \u201cUhm. You\u2019re crazy about football and golly, could you ever be so mean? Yikes. But then again, you were banned from the museum\u2026\u201d She tapped her fingers to her mouth. \u201cNah, you would\u2019ve told me that yesterday, so that\u2019s the lie, no one is that mean.\u201d</p><p>He made a horn-like sound, shouting \u201cWRONG!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat! Oh my god, you\u2019re a terrible person Christopher,\u201d her mouth drops in disbelief. \u201cYour poor, poor brother!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI truly was the worst brother ever when it came to pranks.\u201d He had a smirk on his face</p><p>\u201cRemind me to never go on a prank war with you, Mr. Evans. And here I am imagining you\u2019re star quarterback, getting all cozy with the head cheerleader and being crowned Prom King.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if. I was the scrawny kid from Drama Class, joined the lacrosse team to kiss up to dad. I was actually dumped at prom!\u201d At her incredulous face, he laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s true, we\u2019re at this party and she said I was too immature and deluded if I thought the acting gig would pay off. But I did get \u2018Most Likely to Die Doing Something Stupid\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she must hate herself right about now.\u201d Lucy chuckled. \u201cHave you ever saw her again after that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot personally, but she works at Lincoln-Sudbury High, Carly has told me she gloats that I took her to prom and never mentions that she left me alone to cry in my neighbor\u2019s front lawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cheekiness of the woman! Next time you do an interview, rattle her out, let\u2019s see how she feels about that.\u201d</p><p>Chris loved that she feels indignant on his behalf.</p><p>\u201cOkay, your turn little lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see. I\u2019m ambidextrous, my handwriting looks exactly the same no matter which hand I use. \u00a0I was once part of a girl band named The Fantastic Four, no correlation to your movie at all. I\u2019m terrified of clowns to the point of hyperventilating.\u201d</p><p>The grin on his face was almost maniacal. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to plan our date.\u201d</p><p>She eyed him with distrust. \u201cNo way you know it that easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, you think I don\u2019t know you usurped the girl band story from Penny?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped. \u201cNO! How could you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually pure dumb luck and the fact that I have a great memory.\u201d He confessed. \u201cA bunch of us went to Mayfair at Harvard Square back in May and they had a food truck called The Fantastic Flour. I tried my best to ignore the jokes and steered clear of the place. Penny, on the other hand, insisted it was destiny and told us about her garage band. For some reason, it stuck with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no fun!\u201d She complained with a smile. \u201cThat was my best fake story, I can\u2019t bluff to save my life!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must suck at poker then,\u201d Chris smirked. \u201cNext time we\u2019re playing strip-poker.\u201d</p><p>She laughed long and hard before he pounced on her, throwing the pillow she was using to cover herself to the side of the bed and dragging her naked body on top of his, tickling her sides. They tumbled around in the bed, sharing a long kiss and Chris saw the moment her pupils dilated. God, he wanted to have her again, she was an addiction he could freely partake in but now wasn\u2019t the time. No, there are things that need to be discussed, they couldn\u2019t spend these few hours fucking each other, as lovely as that thought was.</p><p>\u201cHow about we go see if that omelet is still warm enough?\u201d He helped her up from the bed, giving her a terry cloth robe that was way to bigger for her and put it on another one.</p><p>\u201cThank you for coming back home with me last night. I\u2019ve had more fun in the past two days than most of this past year.\u201d He hugged her after tying a loose knot on the robe.</p><p>\u201cThank you for asking me to come back.\u201d She cupped his cheek and stroked his beard. \u201cI really liked spending time with you, Chris. Us meeting was the highlight of a somewhat insipid year.\u201d</p><p>A deer in headlights. That was most likely the look he sported now. He knew this conversation was coming, but still, he dreaded it.</p><p>\u201cUhm. About that. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>-.-.-.-.-.-.-</p><p>One cold Spanish Omelet and three cups of coffee later, Chris and Lucy sat on the family room sofa. He lounged lazily on the chase with Lucy laying down across him, her head on his lap. His phone was docked on the side table, Christmas music coming from hidden speakers around the living room, Chris had turned on the lights of his Christmas tree and the twinkling lights played around them.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay about the whole blind date thing?\u201d Chris inquired, slowly combing her hair, a small gesture he was learning she loved and he enjoyed doing it for her.</p><p>\u201cDo I still want to kill Penny? Sure do. I might push her from our dock into the frozen waters of Otsego lake at least once while we\u2019re back home but I know her heart was in the right place. She was right, I wouldn\u2019t have come if she told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why not? Was the idea of meeting me that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Lucy cradled the hand that rested on her belly but didn\u2019t look up at him. \u201cI have a less than stellar record with men and although these past years have been rather lonely, I welcomed it, it was better than putting myself out there just to get shot down again. I didn\u2019t bother looking and I got rather creative at avoiding my friends meddling in my non-existent love life. They tried to set me up with people before, Terry even asked me if I had changed sides, and the next time we hung out he introduced me to Lauren and hightailed out of there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d He pulled on her hair, bringing her eyes to his. \u201cSo, you and Lauren\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your mind out of the gutter Christopher, nothing happened. She\u2019s a lovely girl, but I\u2019m not bi. We had a few drinks, plotted to kill Terry and parted ways as good friends. She\u2019s married now, her wife is pregnant. It\u2019s a little boy by the way.\u201d Lucy fetched her phone from the coffee table and opened Instagram, showing him a post about a week old.</p><p>\u201cLauren is the brunette?\u201d She nodded and Chris looked at another picture. \u201cWell damn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re imagining it, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry baby, I\u2019m a man after all.\u201d He gave her a very unapologetic grin when she snatched the phone out of his hand. His eyes searched hers and he was serious when he spoke. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had such terrible experiences with dating before. But I\u2019m glad you decided to come to Boston.\u201d</p><p>She smiled radiantly at him.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>They were silent but for Sinatra singing about a white Christmas and Dean Martin crying about letting it snow. Well, he had gotten his wish about half an hour ago, the streets were once again covered in white fluff, thick flocks hitting the large windows panels.</p><p>\u201cI have a really important question for you,\u201d Chris said, stopping the slow massage of her scalp.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026 Okay?\u201d Lucy studied his face, looking for a clue of what that question could be.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen the ring?\u201d He questioned with a serious expression.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, the ring! No, Garret wouldn\u2019t show it to me! It\u2019s on my travel bag and I\u2019m not even allowed to look at it. He actually used that word.\u201d She huffed.</p><p>\u201cCan you believe he wouldn\u2019t show it to me? I\u2019m his best friend, I should at least get a peak before the big day.\u201d Chris trailed off. \u201cOkay, maybe not, but I\u2019m so curious, he wouldn\u2019t tell me anything besides it\u2019s from Tiffany.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked me about Penny\u2019s preferences, so I\u2019m guessing it might be a gold band with a central round diamond in a solitaire style, but Garret would not confirm even that for me. I know he wants Penny to see it before anyone else but come on, gimme the deets, brah!\u201d They laughed together and Chris ribbed her for her terrible Boston accent.</p><p>\u201cGarret\u2019s my best friend. He\u2019s been there for me since my first year of high school, he believed in me when I didn\u2019t.\u201d His forehead creased. \u201cShe\u2019ll say yes, right? I mean, you\u2019re her sister, you must know whether Penny might say yes or no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I know she\u2019ll say yes?\u201d Lucy lifted his shoulder in a half shrug. \u00a0\u201cI mean, I can\u2019t know for sure that a hundred percent Chris, but she\u2019s absolutely and irrevocably in love with Garret since maybe their second date. She called me after he dropped her off and we spent two hours talking, which basically consisted of Penny praising Garret from his eyes to the way he would treat the staff at the restaurant.\u201d Happiness swelled within her when she remembered how excited Penny sounded on the phone.<i> I\u2019m gonna marry him someday babyboo, I just know that</i>. \u201cDo I believe she won\u2019t let him finish the proposal before she starts screaming yes? Absolutely!\u201d</p><p>Chris massaged the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cGod, you scared me for half a second.\u201d Chris chuckled before continuing. \u201cHe was insufferable during the first few months. We\u2019re all over Europe to promote the first Avengers and I asked both him and Guillermo to come with me, so they could keep me company and I wouldn\u2019t be so strung out with anxiety. Garret would get up at 2 am whenever we were so he could call Penny when she got back from work, or she would call him at 5 am her time while we\u2019re pausing for lunch. I told Garret to fly her to Paris so they could meet, impress her with a date on a caf\u00e9 near the Eiffel Tower and she said no, that they weren\u2019t at that point in their relationship yet. That\u2019s when I knew Penny would be perfect for Garret, she wasn\u2019t easily impressed by what his money could buy her. He told me once her favorite type of date included coffee and sitting on a park bench watching their dogs play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad made a point to always impart on us that you shouldn\u2019t measure a person by their wealth but on how well they treat those who do not share it,\u201d Lucy told him. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy to become jaded and lose perspective of how to be a decent human being when you don\u2019t know what it is to struggle to make ends meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d the twinkly lights were playing tricks with her hair, the bright shades of red tangling from Chris\u2019 fingers. He paused to rearrange the strands falling over her eyes, carefully tucking it behind her ears. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m a conceited prick or that my ego needs its own zip code or something but aside from that the various quips about my acting, you never once mentioned me being, well, me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you wanted me to?\u201d Lucy had a hand softly stroking Dodger\u2019s auburn coat while the pooch lay on the floor next to them, his head rolling back and forth after her hand. Her eyes focused on his, studying him. \u201cDid you want me to fangirl and be all over the great Chris Evans, Actor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Must definitely not.\u201d His left hand grabbed hers and brought it to his mouth, lightly kissing her knuckles, drawing in a breath. \u201cIt got harder to make friends or date people outside the industry since Captain America. I knew that would happen, but it sucks sometimes you know? I really don\u2019t like dating actress but\u2026 it\u2019s easier, less messy if you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarret once commented you got really good at smelling fakers.\u201d Lucy sat back up and faced Chris, pulling her legs close to her chest, head resting on her knees.</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s a skill you need to hone very quickly otherwise you\u2019ll live in a world full of people trying to blow smoke up your ass to get something from you. You see this person you want to interact with, be it a girl you wanna hook up with or this dude who talks beer and artisanal cheese and maybe could be a friend, you know, and you approach them, you wanna get to know them, but the minute they see the actor, Chris disappears and Chris Evans, must take his place. That had been my life up to two nights ago. Then you appear and while you did acknowledge the actor, you brushed past him and went straight to Chris.\u201d He got a hold of her hand before continuing, \u201cWe met and didn\u2019t talk much before we were all over each other, and can you really blame me for that? \u2018Cuz look at you\u2026 But when we did talk, you busted my chops about football, you weren\u2019t afraid to tell me to shut up when I needed to, and I fucking loved that, it\u2019s been a while since a girl called me on my shit.\u201d</p><p>She held her right hand over her heart and raised the left one, \u201cI, Lucy Seabrook, hereby promise to always call you on your shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways, huh? That sounds awful like you\u2019d want to spend more time with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I\u2019ve been smitten with you for quite some time Chris.\u201d At his puzzled face, she continued. \u201cAlthough I\u2019ve never come to visit Penny in Boston, she\u2019s been plenty of times to New York. At first, she\u2019d come with a couple of friends, or we\u2019d get together with my friends and consume a lot of alcohol and enjoy a hell of a good time. And one day instead of a couple of girlfriends, she brought Garret. Just a friend, you know, nothing to see here, she said that shit every other phone call, but I knew better. Anyways, Garret had this friend, Chris. And Chris is the coolest guy on the planet; they went snowboarding, they went to Walt Disney World with his family, they went to Vegas and had a hell of good time\u2026 Chris couldn\u2019t be around much, but he was a bro like no other. Garret respects and admires you like a true brother by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mutual,\u201d Chris crossed his leg and turned to her, waiting.</p><p>\u201cSo Chris is a constant on your life even though you never met him; he\u2019s now in the stories your sister tells you as well, he helps at Christopher\u2019s Heaven, donates a good chunk of money to the place. Of course, you\u2019ve seen pictures of everyone, and the guy in the left holding a beer or making a face, that\u2019s Chris, such a fun and down to earth guy, such a great outlook on life. And then one day you\u2019re watching Game of Thrones with your sister and her boyfriend, and hey, isn\u2019t that a tv spot from Winter Soldier? The Captain America guy kinda looks like your friend Chris, Gar and OH.\u201d She shook her head sheepishly. \u201cI fell for you before I met you. Not with the actor, but this great guy named Chris, who happens to act and plays Captain Steve Rogers now and then, who\u2019s friends with my sister and her boyfriend. It does help that he\u2019s crazy good in bed and damn, can make me weak on the knees just by kissing my neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrazy good in bed, huh?\u201d Cupping her face, he softly kisses her lips, hands coaxing her body towards him. Opening her legs, Lucy straddles Chris\u2019 lap, her shirt riding up to expose her bottom and Chris moans when she rubs against his cock through the thin lace and cotton barriers.</p><p>She giggled then, a beautiful sound that made his warmed his whole body. He needed to make sure this was just the first of many, many dates. Chris leaned closer, lips gently brushing hers. He enveloped her small hands with his large ones.</p><p>\u201cI live a hectic life.\u201d His eyes turned serious and he saw a look of worry cross her face. \u201cI can be gone for months at times, sometimes with no break at all. I\u2019m an asshole sometimes, scratch that, most of the time. I\u2019m no prize Lucy, but I really, really wanna see you again.\u201d</p><p>A smile tucked at the corner of her lips, freeing one hand and running her index finger along his forehead, smoothing a frown line that he didn\u2019t know he sported.</p><p>\u201cYou might not believe you are blue ribbon material Chris, but it\u2019s part of my job to judge talents when I encounter them and you, my dear, deserve first place in a lot of categories.\u201d The tips of his ears felt hot at her praise. \u201cI\u2019m hard headed and a workaholic, I spend over eighty hours teaching and training and my brother calls me a mule, that\u2019s how stubborn I am. Having said that, I really, really wanna see you again as well.\u201d</p><p>Chris let of a breath he didn\u2019t know he was holding, a big smile on his face, bringing her close for a hug.</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m blue ribbon material you say?\u201d he moved back to look at her, raising one eyebrow suggestively and tickling her side. \u201cCan I see the judges notes, please? I need to know what my strengths were and where I need to improve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop, stop!\u201d her giggles filled the room and he thought they were the cutest thing. \u201cYou\u2019re such a polpetto Chris!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a polpetto si, a meatball ah?,\u201d his Italian accent sucked, but she laughed harder when he closed his hands in the traditional Italian gesture and shook them exclaiming, \u201cDio santo!\u201d</p><p>She rested her forehead on his naked chest, a hand coming up to trace his clavicle tattoo.</p><p>\u201cIs that all the Italian you know, caro mio?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s about it.\u201d Skilled fingers unbuttoned the shirt she wore, parting the sides to unveil her breasts. His palmed the globes, thumbs skimming the quickly hardening nipples. \u201cWe used to pester Uncle Mike for curse words, but he always told us vaffanculo, so that\u2019s the only one I know.\u201d</p><p>She planted small kisses on his tattoo, the tip of her tongue tracing the words, fingering his pebbled nipples. \u201cVoglio le tue mani su tutto il corpo e la tua testa fra le gambe. Ti piace cozi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what you just said but bring it on baby.\u201d Lucy yelped when his strong hands picked her from his lap and laid her back on the couch, opening her legs with his knees to rest his pelvis against her, a hiss escaping her when his covered cock made contact with her mound. \u201cBring it on.\u201d</p><p>__________________________________________</p><p>\n\nNotes:</p><p>Polpetto \u2013 meatball</p><p>Dio Santo \u2013 oh my god. Use lots of hands gesture when using this one!</p><p>Caro mio \u2013 my dear, my love</p><p>Vaffanculo \u2013 up your ass, mostly a light version of fuck you.</p><p>Voglio le tue mani su tutto il corpo e la tua testa fra le gambe.

                "content_raw": "<p>Chris woke around 8 am, alone in bed and for a moment he panicked, thinking Lucy never actually came home with him last night. A look around the room revealed her suitcase and a large soft luggage bag neatly stacked near his closet, her purse on the nearby chair. The pillow he was hugging still smelled like her shampoo and he smiled at the memory of them showering together and how he had insisted on washing her hair, his hands working the long strands into different hairstyles while she laughed at his portray of a flamboyant hairdresser.</p>[[MORE]]<p>They\u2019d arrived home around 8 pm after Garret read him the riot act while Lucy gathered her stuff. <i>He\u2019d better not fuck this up, was he sure he wanted to pursue this? Otherwise he better end their date right there.</i></p><p>Date. Chris scoffed at the word. He was sure Lucy still didn\u2019t know the meeting at the game was a set-up arranged by her sister and his best friend; a blind date where only one of them knew they were on a date at all. Penny insisted Lucy wouldn\u2019t come if she were to tell her and it was up to Chris to make the move.</p><p>Ever since he wrapped Gifted and came back home complaining he had had enough of the Hollywood dating scene, Penny redoubled her efforts to get Chris and Lucy together. <i>\u201cShe\u2019s the sweetest girl, Chris, always there with a smile when I was hurt. She was the first to organize a fundraising and collecting food and clothes after the Mitchell\u2019s house fire. She\u2019s got the biggest heart of anyone I know and they abused her trust. She\u2019s been hurt pretty and she\u2019s afraid of trying again. I believe you can change that.\u201d</i> Penny said over pizza one day. Chris had his doubts, not sure if he was ready to deal with so much baggage. <i>\u201cWould you date her?\u201d</i> Chris asked Garret over beers, <i>\u201cShe\u2019s fragile man but she\u2019s a special girl. Hell yes, I\u2019d date her. She\u2019s wicked smart, sassy as hell and can make you laugh like a lunatic plus, she\u2019s built like a fifties pin-up girl, all tits, ass, and thighs. You keep saying you want something real, here\u2019s your chance at it.\u201d</i></p><p>So Chris agreed to the date, picking a football game for their first meeting, a common ground where both could still enjoy themselves if the chemistry wasn\u2019t there. Except they hit it off so good that any plans of taking her out for dinner so they could get to know each flew out of the window and now he was working backward to convince her she was more than a one-night stand.</p><p>The moment he left the bedroom Chris could hear Lucy singing downstairs. She wasn\u2019t going to win any Grammys but she wasn\u2019t bad either. He made his way downstairs carefully as to not alert her of his presence.</p><p>He stopped just before reaching the bottom, watching as Lucy belted the lyrics to an old pop song into a wooden spoon, moving around the kitchen with her eyes closed during the chorus. He watched as she opened and closed his cabinets, a quiet yay reaching his ears when she found a glass bowl, bringing the bowl with her back to the counter where eggs, cheese, sliced potatoes, and condiments all waited. And since when did he own a cast iron pan?</p><p>Lucy sang and danced while she mixed the ingredients, pouring them into the hot pan, her oversized nightshirt hanging loosely on her shoulders, purplish marks dotting her neck. He\u2019d never been one to leave them before but with her he was a man possessed, staking a claim so everyone could see she belonged with him. A twinge of jealousy hit him at the thought of a man getting closer enough to look at her neck.</p><p>Chris knew it was probably too early to feel that way but he wasn\u2019t concerned with a timetable any more. He\u2019d been infatuated with the idea of her for the past month and the reality turned out to be so much better. Their time at the museum yesterday had been fantastic, no awkward silences, no lulls in the conversation. He hanged into her every word, committing to memory every like and dislike she shared, wanting to know everything about the firecracker redhead who danced her way into his life.</p><p>He leaned against the fridge, crossing his arms.</p><p>\u201cIs there a cover fee for the show or is it included with breakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat depends, what kind of payment are we talking about?\u201d Lucy smiled brightly at him, rinsing her hands.</p><p>\u201cI can think of a few ways. I\u2019m also known for being a very generous tipper.\u201d</p><p>Chris walked over to her, picking up a napkin and drying each individual finger before bringing her hands over his neck, leaning down to gently kiss her.</p><p>\u201cTop o\u2019 the mornin\u2019 to ya, little lady.\u201d He smiled at her when their lips separated, tipping an imaginary hat at her.</p><p>\u201cMornin\u2019 sir,\u201d she giggled and did a little curtsy. \u201cGive it 25 minutes and you\u2019ll eat the best Spanish omelet of your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving so it better be good.\u201d Chris challenged, letting go of her to fill Dodger\u2019s food and water bowl.</p><p>\u201cOf your life.\u201d She pointed the wood spoon at his retrieving back.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very tall order little lady, I\u2019ve been alive for quite some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept that, I\u2019m older than you.\u201d She reminded Chris while she brought the coffee pot and the juice jar to the small breakfast table by the window.</p><p>\u201cYou know what that makes you, right?\u201d He called back to her, already on his way back from the laundry room.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She moved back to the counter, checking on the food on the stovetop, turning it off and moving the pan to the oven.</p><p>\u201cA cougar.\u201d He said was behind her, hands circling her waist and bringing her body close to his, his lips closing on the pulse point on her neck and effectively ending the protest on her lips. \u201cA very fine,\u201d kiss, \u201cgorgeous,\u201d bite, \u201cbeautiful cougar.\u201d</p><p>He sucked the tender skin where her neck met her shoulder, leaving yet another mark.</p><p>\u201cKeep that up and I\u2019ll need a scarf inside the house when I get to my parent\u2019s,\u201d she made no movement to stop him, hands resting over his.</p><p>\u201cYou have a very biteable neck.\u201d Chris kissed the same spot again just to prove a point and she giggled. \u201cI\u2019ll try to curb my inner vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour inner vampire is quite welcome to other places where I can better hide the evidence.\u201d Lucy looked back up to him, a hint of mischievousness in her voice.</p><p>His hands immediately moved to cup her breasts over her shirt. \u201cOh, you mean here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhm\u2026 or here.\u201d Lucy\u2019s hand gently guided him to the inside of her thighs.</p><p>\u201cYour idea is so much better than mine.\u201d Chris turned her around and his mouth immediately found hers in a powerful and possessive kiss.</p><p>He was rapidly becoming addicted to her mouth, her lips moving like fine silk on his, tongue searching for him, a delirious chase he couldn\u2019t get enough of. He heard her moan against his mouth and it stoked the fire already burning inside of him.</p><p>Chris\u2019 strong hands clutched Lucy\u2019s waist, bringing her closer to his body and in a swift movement he lifted and dropped her at the counter, her body bouncing when she landed.</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy, you could throw your back or someth\u2026\u201d</p><p>His lips quickly silenced her words and he nipped at her for good measure when they separated.</p><p>\u201cI can bench press over 300 pounds Lucy, and you weigh what, a bit more than half that? Let me worry about what I can and I can\u2019t handle,\u201d his hands slid up her thighs till he finds the white lace cheeky panties she wore, thumbs hooking around the lace and pulling them down as he whispered in her ear. \u201cI love how my hands are full of you when I run them up your thighs, when I grab your ass, how your breasts feel heavy on my hands\u2026 and just so you know I\u2019d love to fuck them.\u201d</p><p>A strangled moan escaped her at his words and she reached for his sweatpants, pushing them down, needing the contact, craving the feel of him. He rocked his hips on her, the head of his cock right on top of her clit, his bare length sliding up and down over her small lips, coating himself in her juices. \u201cI want you inside me, Chris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh, I\u2019m not finished. Trivia time. Did you know I had a crush on Jessica Rabbit the first time I saw Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\u201d Chris unbuttons her shirt, bottom to top, slowly unwrapping her like a present, thrusting against her with each new inch of skin he reveals, her moans spurring him on. \u201cTo my twelve-year-old self, she was the hottest woman I\u2019d ever seen, who cares if she was a cartoon. It was the first time I actively jerked off.\u201d He parted the sides of her nightgown, exposing her breast and he licks his lips at the sight of her naked chest. His hands tangle in her hair bringing the red strands around her left shoulder. Her eyes are blown, pupils dilated, almost no green left and he thinks she looked like a fucking goddess at that moment. He stood between her legs, his nose skimming the pulse point on her neck, lips following suit, before stepping back, making her pout for the lack of contact. \u201cGod, look at you, my personal Jessica Rabbit, pouty lips and all, my fucking wet dream coming true, sinful curves and deliciously naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen come here and fuck your Rabbit,\u201d she pulled him back, mouths clashing, tongues dancing together. Her hands roamed over the taut muscles of his arms, tracing the veins and kneading the flesh of his shoulders, fingertips caressing the nape of his neck with one hand while the other danced on the planes of his chest, following the trail of hair that led to his cock.</p><p>Lucy planted open-mouthed kisses on his chest, gently biting his right nipple, sucking the small hard nub in her mouth, enthralled by the sounds he made.</p><p>\u201cFuck, do that again,\u201d Chris asked in a low voice and she smiled against his chest, moving to the other side. She flattened her tongue against his nipple before closing her mouth against it, teeth rasping the pebbled skin and sucking hard and at the same time that she closed her hand over him, dragging her fingers over the crown in slow but precise motions. A guttural moan rocked his body and he thrust hard against her hand, pre-come leaking from the bulbous head.</p><p>\u201cHow did you like it?\u201d Lucy grinned up to him, hand fisting over his shaft as she licked around the tattoo on his ribcage.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2026 god, don\u2019t tease,\u201d he faltered when her fingers squeezed around him, both hands working in a precise rhythm. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely going into the pro column.\u201d</p><p>Her laugh is cut short when he pulls her hair back, covering her mouth with his. Their kisses became long and slow, fueled by their moans, tongues sinfully dancing together as hands travel everywhere; caressing her boobs, touching his ass, tangled in her hair, gripping his waist.</p><p>\u201cLay back on your arms.\u201d Chris nudges her back with a soft touch and she obeys, releasing his shaft and arranging herself on the black marble. Fingers and mouth working together, he traces a pattern over her body, stroking over her collarbone, rolling her nipples between expert fingers, dipping his tongue on her belly button. He nips at the small curve of her belly, biting and bruising the skin and smirks at her. \u201cNo one will see this one, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsidering it\u2019s not exactly swimming weather outside, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d she smiled and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he rubbed his bearded face on her inner thighs. \u201cI\u2019m not finished though.\u201d</p><p>Warm open-mouthed kisses on the inside of her thighs left her panting and pleading for more.</p><p>\u201cUse your words, Lucy.\u201d His warm breath tickled her lips, making her squirm.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tease me like that.\u201d Wild eyes glanced down, \u201cI want your mouth on me. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, madam.\u201d The feel of his silky tongue made her whole body undulate, a loud gasp echoing in the large room as he bathed her in slow and sure motions. He gave her a wicked grin before his lips closed on her clit, tongue swirling on the taut nerve and her hips lifted, legs jumping wildly. He hooked her left leg over his shoulder for anchorage, grasping the curve of her hips to keep her from moving and her small hand covered his, fingers tangling together. Chris smiled, eyes framed by long eyelashes looking up to her, loving to watch her surrender under his touch. He was lost to the scent of her, the sweet and tangy aroma filling his lungs.</p><p>\u201cChris.\u201d A gasp escaped her swollen lips, eyes fluttering close with each pass of his tongue, shallow breaths, and a racing heart.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re beautiful,\u201d His mouth barely leaves her to whisper his adoration. \u201cAre you ready for more baby?\u201d</p><p>Two fingers sank into her, scissoring and curling against her walls. He devoured her, lips and tongue working her clit, fingers hooked inside her, rubbing that sweet spot inside her over and over. Her hips thrust wildly upward, incomprehensible cries falling from her lips when he sped up his motions, humming his praise, the vibrations on causing the most delicious electric sparks making her legs writhe and sending her dangerously close to the edge.</p><p>Her body grew taut, goosebumps spreading all over and he felt her clenching his fingers, fingernails leaving small crescent shapes on the back of his hand before releasing his hand and threading them around his hair, keeping him where she needed the most.</p><p>\u201cSo close, oh god, I need\u2026 close.\u201d</p><p>His teeth scraped her clit and it\u2019s her undoing. Lucy cried out to him, tremors rocking her, legs quivering as he continued to touch her, transforming her orgasm in an ongoing sensation that washed over her back and forth every time his tongues her clit, fingers still moving inside her now with a renewed fervor.</p><p>\u201cGive one more baby, I know you have it in you.\u201d Another pair of fingers made contact with her clit, rubbing it in a maddening pace as he kisses her inner thighs, bruising the skin with his teeth. He slipped his fingers from inside her pussy, digits coated in her cum, and moved them lower, pressing them lightly against her puckered hole, making contact hard enough to let her know he\u2019s there. His tongue enters her, lapping up the escaping slick as his index fingers breached the impossibly tight hole.</p><p>\u201cChris, oh god, oh f\u2026\u201d a second wave hit her and her arm gave out, spasm taking over her body and her eyes rolled to the back of her head, the fire never ending, the darkness threatening to take over.</p><p>She pushed him away, her body spent as she laid on the counter, breathing heavily.</p><p>\u201cFuck, you look gorgeous when you cum,\u201d Chris\u2019 eyes were zeroed on hers with a smug smile on his face, fingers slowly caressing the skin of her hips. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a moment, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m alive,\u201d Lucy closed her eyes, drawing a deep breath, the sound of his laugh making her smile. \u201cYep, I\u2019m alive.\u201d</p><p>Chris pulled her up and her hands immediately gravitated to his face, bringing him close, kissing his shiny lips, thumbing the moisture on his mustache and bringing it to her mouth, her tongue making a show of licking the digit clean, groaning at the taste of herself on him. He moaned and rocked himself against her core, callused hands curling on the skin of her bottom.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Lucy nuzzled his neck, kissing the smooth skin, her nose pressed on his beard, \u201cI\u2019ve never let anyone back there before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever?\u201d the whimper is followed by a grunt when she shook her head. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready, let me know, I can make you feel so, so good baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about I think about it and I get back to you on that.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause before he agreed and dove for her mouth, tongues dueling in a heated kiss, hissing when her hands closed around him, sliding up and down the length with torturous gestures.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never wanted anyone the way I want you,\u201d her hands stroked and twisted, creating the perfect amount of pressure that forced him to thrust back searching for more friction. Lucy nibbled his earlobe and murmured, \u201cGet inside me Chris, now.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a command he\u2019s eager to obey and he brings her closer to the edge of the counter, dragging his cock up her slit, making them both moan.</p><p>And then he stopped, looking around for a moment, groaning.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>His low curse made her head pop. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t bring any condoms down with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d The disbelief in her voice made him chuckle.</p><p>More expletives left his mouth as he opened a few drawers before finally admitting defeat with a shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cWell little rabbit, for starters my pants didn\u2019t have any pockets. Plus, I didn\u2019t exactly plan on fucking you on my counter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so sturdy though, it just begs for some action.\u201d She bounces a little, grinning at him.</p><p>Chris threw his head back with a laugh, raising both eyebrows at her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re using me for my kitchen, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, I\u2019ve been found,\u201d she snapped her fingers with a mocking frown.</p><p>\u201cCome on woman, let\u2019s go upstairs before\u2026\u201d</p><p>The oven pinged, signaling the food was ready.</p><p>\u201cThat.\u201d Chris dropped his head on her shoulder while Lucy tried to contain her mirth, certain he would not appreciate her laughing right now.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Lucy glanced from the oven back to him, fingers dancing between the hairs of his chest. \u201cI\u2019m alright with re-heated food if you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank fuck.\u201d He promptly hoisted her out of the counter, pausing just long enough to pick up his pants from the floor, just to look up and see her running up the stairs.</p><p>Lucy stopped on the middle step, shedding her shirt, calling out to him with her fingers. She squeaked and ran when Chris started after her, taking the steps two at a time, catching up to her right by his bedroom door, caging her body with his.</p><p>\u201cGotcha.\u201d Her whole skin prickled with his whisper and she couldn\u2019t help the moan that escaped when he bit her earlobe, tugging on the flesh. The feel of him rocking against her as he kissed the back of her neck reduced her to a quivering mess as he opened the door, directing her to the recently made bed.</p><p>Spinning in his arms, she kissed him hard, forcing his body toward the bed. \u201cLay down, keep your hands above your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBossy, bossy,\u201d Chris kissed her before laying down, making a show of shaking his ass at her, which earned him a playful swat. \u201cCareful with the merchandise woman.\u201d</p><p>Lucy giggle-snorted, shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ll handle all the packages with care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee that you do.\u201d He winked and got comfortable, holding onto the pillow under his head, licking his lips when she crawled over him, kneeling between his legs.</p><p>Her lips brushed over his brow, nose, and cheeks before touching his mouth, a pink tongue tracing his pouty lips. They kissed with their eyes open, Chris trying to follow her every time she retreated, only to kiss him again when his head hit the pillow with a growl.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be mean. I love kissing you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes crinkled, a smile tugging at the corner of her lips. The next time she didn\u2019t pull back, her tongue tangling with his, lips synced in a slow and sensuous dance, making his body buckle when she sucked his tongue, knuckles white from clutching the pillow.</p><p>She teased his neck, caressing the pulse point with her tongue, working her way down his body and Chris felt like fire wafted over his skin with each touch. Stopping over his dusky nipples, she replayed the earlier actions, this time with more teeth and Chris decided the move deserved a whole new column titled \u2018fucking brilliant\u2019. \u00a0</p><p>The hard muscles of his abdomen twitched when her teeth made contact, and she soothed him with butterfly kisses over the tattoo on his lower rib cage. The first dip of her tongue into his belly button bucked his hips, the anticipation consuming him as she licked over the thick line of hair connecting to the base of his cock, her nose nuzzling the velvet skin that rested over his lower abdomen.</p><p>\u201cLucy\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatience Chris.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to wait long, a hitched breath meeting the first touch of her tongue on the underside of his erection. She tempted him with one long lick before enveloping the head with her lips, tonguing the slit and tasting the drops of his salty pre-come already there.</p><p>An ache formed deep in his belly when her hands closed around him, pumping up and down the thick member, a thumb pressing the vein on the underside with every downward stroke. She cupped his balls as her mouth descended on him, sucking him slowly into her mouth, working her way down.</p><p>Chris wanted so badly to touch her, to run his hands everywhere while she claimed him, but he was good with following orders. \u201cGod, you\u2019re killing me, Lucy, such a pretty and talented mouth you have, fuck, so good around my cock.\u201d He heard and felt her moaning around him, the humming adding to his pleasure, and when she hollowed her cheeks and took him all the way he cursed loudly, body shaking. \u201cPlease, please let me touch you gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>She let him go with a pop, swirling her tongue around the weeping head, flattening her tongue and dragging over his frenulum, wanton eyes, dark and needy, never leaving him when she nodded and took him back into her mouth, her lips sinking until he could feel the back of her throat, grunting and fighting the urge to thrust up. He ran his hands over her shoulders, gentle fingers cupping her cheek while she engulfed him, her nose pressed to the trimmed hairs of his groin.</p><p>His labored breaths were cut by deep moans, pleasure cursing through this body.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not gonna last, baby.\u201d</p><p>His hands now played with her hair, gathering it to a side, holding it atop of her head and finally settling with tangling it all in a ponytail so he could watch what her as she worked to bring him to climax. The need to thrust became unbearable, a scorching heat consuming and overwhelming his senses.</p><p>\u201cLet it go, Chris,\u201d she enticed him and he surrendered, plunging against her mouth, marveling at the feeling of her silky tongue working over him when he retreated.</p><p>Sheer pleasure consumed him, the ache in his belly spreading all over him and he barely had time to warm her of his impending climax. Lucy paid him no mind, lips tight around his cock while two fingers pressed down on the perineum and he lost it, swelling and coating the inside of her mouth, hands tight on her hair to keep her from moving.</p><p>She swallowed and he groaned loudly, curses and moans mixed together while he sang her praises, calling her name over and over. Chris twitched when Lucy licked him clean, letting him go with a final pat to the head of his cock. A smile played on her lips as she gave him a small kiss at the corner of his lips before resting her head on the nook of his neck.</p><p>Chris was quiet for a moment before he let out a whistle.</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>Her body shook with contained laughter.</p><p>\u201cThat good, huh?\u201d Lucy drew small patterns on his chest and he rejoiced in the feeling of being so close to her.</p><p>\u201cFuck yes.\u201d He slowly kissed her, his tongue exploring the swollen lips. A small peck to her nose and he released her.</p><p>A blissful silence fell over them, his hands combing the long locks as she did the same to his beard. They stayed like that for some time, until Chris spoke again.</p><p>\u201cDo you have the number for The New York Times?\u201d He asked with a serious expression.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you need it for?\u201d Lucy side-eyed Chris.</p><p>\u201cI want to take out an ad and tell all those fools in New York City how incredibly stupid they are for passing you over. Or I might do a full-page \u201cthank you\u201d for the exact same reason, I\u2019m still undecided.\u201d He twisted them both till she was laying on top of him, taking the opportunity to run his hands over her ribcage, waist and finally resting both hands on her bottom, holding them loosely over her flesh.</p><p>\u201cAll of this over a good blowjob?\u201d She chuckled and adjusted herself so her pussy hovered over his hardening cock.</p><p>He shook his head and poked her on the side.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, but being on the receiving end of said blowjob I think you meant fantastic. Curl your toes and scream yourself hoarse fantastic,\u201d he is delighted when a blush covered not only the face but her breasts as well. He licked his lips and bucked against her, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m definitely thanking them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour recovering time is quite a feat, Chris.\u201d Her hips rocked slowly against him and Lucy left a small sigh when her clit rubbed on the veiny member.</p><p>He tightened his hold on her buttocks as she danced wantonly over him, dragging herself across the hard member.</p><p>\u201cI am\u2026 Captain America after all.\u201d A shallow moan followed another thrust and he grabbed the condom next to the pillow, ripping the package and handing it to her.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t the poor the guy a virgin though? Did the whole beefcake flavored popsicle thing before he could get the girl?\u201d Lucy scooted back just enough to free him from under her, spreading the wetness she left on his throbbing cock before rolling the latex down.</p><p>He bent her down by her shoulders, bracing one arm around her waist while the other holds her close, hands gripping her neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna pretend you just didn\u2019t call Cap a virgin beefcake flavored popsicle, alright?\u201d He preened when she giggled and it occurred to him how much time had passed since sex was this poignant and so carefree at the same time. Lucy brought a whole new game to the table; sexy, fun, extremely hot and addictive, just like her.</p><p>He ran his nose on the thick vein there, kissing up to her ear, nibbling on the flesh. \u201cCan I fuck you now little rabbit?\u201d</p><p>God how he loved how he could make her body flush and shiver with just a few words. Chris\u2019 lips covered hers in a scorching kiss, tongues clashing before Lucy righted her body and positioned herself over him.</p><p>\u201cI believe,\u201d she hissed as Chris pinched her nipples, \u201cI believe I\u2019m the one doing the fucking now.\u201d</p><p>Hungry eyes met as she eased down on him, never breaking eye contact till she is flushed on his lap, throwing her head back with a lustful moan.</p><p>\u201cGod Chris, I\u2019m so full of you.\u201d She stilled for a moment, getting used to the sensation.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so tight baby, I can feel every bit of your pussy hugging me.\u201d He moaned breathily when she squeezed him, hands flying to her thighs and rear. \u201cYou gonna wreck me just by doing that and then you won\u2019t get to cum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t have that now, can we?\u201d Lucy rolled her hips in a slow movement, keeping most of his cock inside her as she rocked side to side, smiling provocatively at the groans coming from Chris.</p><p>Hands sprawled over his large chest as leverage, Lucy impressed a hard pace, pulling all the way up and slamming back down with slow circles that had her eyes rolling to the back of her head, the head of Chris\u2019 cock hitting her g-spot with every downward movement.</p><p>Holding the soft flesh on the back of her thighs, Chris met her thrusts with his own, grinding her down on his pelvis. He shifted so his feet were flat against the mattress, starting a pattern of quick and shallow thrusts that made Lucy drop her head to her heaving chest, her hair falling around them like a curtain as her hands clang to his shoulders, fingernails digging into the muscles, moaning and sobbing.</p><p>Walls clenching around him, he could sense that she was close, her mouth forming a delicate o shape, eyes closed in ecstasy. Every nerve ending is alive and bursting with energy, all connected to the spot where his cock entered her and she gasped, air heavily leaving her lungs when waves of pleasure crashed into her, chants of his name is like a song to his ears.</p><p>\u201cGod, Chris!\u201d She screamed his name, dropping to kiss him, her tongue sweeping over his. \u201cFuck, you make me feel so good.\u201d</p><p>Drawing circles up here sides, he held her closer, fingers flexing in her waist.</p><p>\u201cRabbit, we\u2019re barely getting started. On your back.\u201d Chris grunted as he lifted her, her juices making his cock glisten. \u201cFuck, look at that\u2026\u201d</p><p>He touched her slick clit when she settled on her back, making her shudder, aftershocks rocking her body with a strangled moan.</p><p>\u201cFucking gorgeous. Your body was made for me, to love it, to worship it. I\u2019m gonna fuck you so good baby.\u201d He got on his knees, bringing her hips level with his, propping her ass up with a discarded pillow.</p><p>\u201cChris, please. I need you.\u201d</p><p>The air is charged with the faint aroma of sex as Chris hovers over her. The caveman inside his brain growled with the need to possess her, make her theirs.</p><p>\u201cYou need my cock? You need me to pound you and make you forget your own name?\u201d His voice is hoarse with lust, eyes blown. He brought her legs up, resting her feet on his shoulders, his member nested on her folds. \u00a0\u201cI can do that rabbit, I\u2019ll fuck you raw, ruin you for anyone else but me. Do you want that?\u201d</p><p>He rocks against her, the crown of his shaft sliding over her clit and she keens, a high-pitched sound that snaps something inside him. He enters her roughly, bottoming out on the first thrust, establishing a hard pace. His moans echo around the room when he sees her holding her breasts, pinching her erect nipples.</p><p>\u201cI want that, yes, I want you. Fuck me, Chris, yes, yes.\u201d Wanton eyes look over at him and he almost lost it, driving into her with and making the headboard hit the wall in a staccato of thrusts.</p><p>One of her legs fell to the side when he let it go and it curled around his knees, keeping his vision unobstructed. Watching his cock disappear inside her is a glorious sight and Chris can barely tear his eyes away to look up, but he was glad he did. Lucy had her arms above her, head thrown to the side, eyes closed and her teeth are dug so hard into her lips he swore she would draw blood at any moment. Her labored breath and moans follow the rhythm of his hips and once in a while she would let a loud wail when he hit that perfect spot inside her.</p><p>The goosebumps are back, his brows furrowed and he had to fight to keep his eyes open, the pleasure coursing through him is too much.</p><p>\u201cEyes on me Lucy.\u201d Chris told her in a slow growl and smiled when dark green orbs focus on him. \u201cYou\u2019re the most beautiful thing in the world. I can feel you\u2019re close baby, cum for me.\u201d</p><p>A thumb is pressed to her clit, rubbing small circles on the hardened nub, propelling her to the end. Lucy gripped the sheets, back bowing from the mattress, calling for him as her body convulsed.</p><p>His own release is there, his powerful thighs clenching as his hips still, her name on his lips, a powerful climax washing over him.</p><p>Breathing heavily, Chris laid down on top of her, holding himself up in his forearms, searching her face only to find her smiling at him, a lazy grin that made his heart flutter.</p><p>\u201cThat was\u2026\u201d slender fingers pushed the sweaty hair out of his forehead and Lucy kissed his cheek, lips lingered on the scruff.</p><p>\u201cIntense? Incredible? Impeccable? Impressive? Illegal?\u201d Chris would have continued but her clasped hand in front of his mouth stopped him.</p><p>\u201cIllegal?\u201d Lucy laughed.</p><p>He licked her palm and she yelped, removing it quickly and giving him a dirty look. He grinned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it is somewhere, you were pretty loud after all.\u201d</p><p>He rolled over from her, leaving the bed to deal with the condom.</p><p>\u201cAnd whose fault is that <i>Mister Dirty Talk Extraordinaire</i>?\u201d She called after him.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m gonna feel guilty about making you scream my name?\u201d He gave her a skeptical look as he came back with a damp hand towel, running it carefully over her.</p><p>\u201cIncorrigible. There\u2019s another one for you.\u201d She stretched and Chris drank on her body. The sight of her naked and pliable in his bed was now ranked top ten in the list of his favorite things.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s play a game.\u201d Chris reclined on the headboard with his legs sprawled on the bed, white sheets covering his lower body. Lucy was on her stomach next to him, hands resting on her chin, feet up and crossed at the ankles, her naked form enticing him. His eyes followed the curves of her back, stopping to admire the tattoo that covered most of her right side, back dipping to form her waist before coming back up to the most amazing ass he\u2019d ever seem, and yes, he had seen more than most men. He needed a distraction otherwise he\u2019d pounce on her again. \u201cTwo truths, one lie.\u201d When she looked at him quizzically, he explained, \u201cWe each tell the other two truths about ourselves and make up a lie, a believable one. The other person has to guess what the lie is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we get if we get the lie right?\u201d she rearranged herself on the bed and he groaned when the movements gave him a better look of her breasts. She caught the look on his eyes and smirked, wagging a finger at him. \u201cBad Chris, stay down boy. Stopping ogling the girls.\u201d She giggled, looking around, finally grabbing a pillow that had been pushed to the edge of the bed and using it as a cover.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve turned me into a fiend, it\u2019s your own sexy fault.\u201d He pouted when the pillow obstructed the view and he drew a breath to try and clear his mind. A sly smile graced his face, he knew exactly what to bet on. \u201cHow about this, three rounds. Winner gets to pick and plan a future date, loser can\u2019t say no to the date no matter what the plan is.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes got big when she understood exactly what that meant. <i>Yeah baby, you\u2019re not escaping so easily from me.</i></p><p>\u201cAnd I can plan any date I like? Picnic, fly a kite, bungee-jumping?\u201d she licked her lips, wide-eyed with all the possibilities but then hesitated, \u201cAre you even allowed to bungee-jump? I mean, don\u2019t you signed a contract stating you must look pretty and can\u2019t do anything that might break a bone and halt productions?\u201d</p><p>Chris threw his head back in laughter, this girl was amazing, so open and earnest, with no agenda, just a gorgeous girl genuinely interested in him.</p><p>\u201cKevin might have a problem with the last one, but sure, whatever you plan.\u201d He admitted, enthralled by the possibilities. A B&amp;B on a vineyard near the coast where they could spend the whole day naked and tangled in each other, only coming out to see the sun setting and to find a small restaurant to eat. A cabin in the woods, lots of pillows scattered around the floor in front of a crackling fireplace. A four-day weekend in Italy, sightseeing near Verona and Genova, drinking wine and holding hands without anyone bothering them. Any of the scenarios had amazing appeal, he just needed to make sure he\u2019d have a chance to make them come to life.</p><p>\u201cFine, let\u2019s play,\u201d she grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re going skinny dipping at Otsego Lake, just so you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that supposed to scare me? I\u2019d love to go skinny dipping with you.\u201d Chris waggled his eyebrow at her. \u201cHere\u2019s an easy one; I played quarterback in high school and we were county champions. My favorite color is blue but sky blue, like on a summer day. I once fooled my brother into peeing his own pants in front of our nanny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave it to you to describe a color like you\u2019re in the middle of a romcom. That\u2019s one truth.\u201d She smiled when he nodded. \u201cUhm. You\u2019re crazy about football and golly, could you ever be so mean? Yikes. But then again, you were banned from the museum\u2026\u201d She tapped her fingers to her mouth. \u201cNah, you would\u2019ve told me that yesterday, so that\u2019s the lie, no one is that mean.\u201d</p><p>He made a horn-like sound, shouting \u201cWRONG!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat! Oh my god, you\u2019re a terrible person Christopher,\u201d her mouth drops in disbelief. \u201cYour poor, poor brother!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI truly was the worst brother ever when it came to pranks.\u201d He had a smirk on his face</p><p>\u201cRemind me to never go on a prank war with you, Mr. Evans. And here I am imagining you\u2019re star quarterback, getting all cozy with the head cheerleader and being crowned Prom King.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if. I was the scrawny kid from Drama Class, joined the lacrosse team to kiss up to dad. I was actually dumped at prom!\u201d At her incredulous face, he laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s true, we\u2019re at this party and she said I was too immature and deluded if I thought the acting gig would pay off. But I did get \u2018Most Likely to Die Doing Something Stupid\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she must hate herself right about now.\u201d Lucy chuckled. \u201cHave you ever saw her again after that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot personally, but she works at Lincoln-Sudbury High, Carly has told me she gloats that I took her to prom and never mentions that she left me alone to cry in my neighbor\u2019s front lawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cheekiness of the woman! Next time you do an interview, rattle her out, let\u2019s see how she feels about that.\u201d</p><p>Chris loved that she feels indignant on his behalf.</p><p>\u201cOkay, your turn little lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see. I\u2019m ambidextrous, my handwriting looks exactly the same no matter which hand I use. \u00a0I was once part of a girl band named The Fantastic Four, no correlation to your movie at all. I\u2019m terrified of clowns to the point of hyperventilating.\u201d</p><p>The grin on his face was almost maniacal. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to plan our date.\u201d</p><p>She eyed him with distrust. \u201cNo way you know it that easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, you think I don\u2019t know you usurped the girl band story from Penny?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped. \u201cNO! How could you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually pure dumb luck and the fact that I have a great memory.\u201d He confessed. \u201cA bunch of us went to Mayfair at Harvard Square back in May and they had a food truck called The Fantastic Flour. I tried my best to ignore the jokes and steered clear of the place. Penny, on the other hand, insisted it was destiny and told us about her garage band. For some reason, it stuck with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no fun!\u201d She complained with a smile. \u201cThat was my best fake story, I can\u2019t bluff to save my life!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must suck at poker then,\u201d Chris smirked. \u201cNext time we\u2019re playing strip-poker.\u201d</p><p>She laughed long and hard before he pounced on her, throwing the pillow she was using to cover herself to the side of the bed and dragging her naked body on top of his, tickling her sides. They tumbled around in the bed, sharing a long kiss and Chris saw the moment her pupils dilated. God, he wanted to have her again, she was an addiction he could freely partake in but now wasn\u2019t the time. No, there are things that need to be discussed, they couldn\u2019t spend these few hours fucking each other, as lovely as that thought was.</p><p>\u201cHow about we go see if that omelet is still warm enough?\u201d He helped her up from the bed, giving her a terry cloth robe that was way to bigger for her and put it on another one.</p><p>\u201cThank you for coming back home with me last night. I\u2019ve had more fun in the past two days than most of this past year.\u201d He hugged her after tying a loose knot on the robe.</p><p>\u201cThank you for asking me to come back.\u201d She cupped his cheek and stroked his beard. \u201cI really liked spending time with you, Chris. Us meeting was the highlight of a somewhat insipid year.\u201d</p><p>A deer in headlights. That was most likely the look he sported now. He knew this conversation was coming, but still, he dreaded it.</p><p>\u201cUhm. About that. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>-.-.-.-.-.-.-</p><p>One cold Spanish Omelet and three cups of coffee later, Chris and Lucy sat on the family room sofa. He lounged lazily on the chase with Lucy laying down across him, her head on his lap. His phone was docked on the side table, Christmas music coming from hidden speakers around the living room, Chris had turned on the lights of his Christmas tree and the twinkling lights played around them.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay about the whole blind date thing?\u201d Chris inquired, slowly combing her hair, a small gesture he was learning she loved and he enjoyed doing it for her.</p><p>\u201cDo I still want to kill Penny? Sure do. I might push her from our dock into the frozen waters of Otsego lake at least once while we\u2019re back home but I know her heart was in the right place. She was right, I wouldn\u2019t have come if she told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why not? Was the idea of meeting me that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Lucy cradled the hand that rested on her belly but didn\u2019t look up at him. \u201cI have a less than stellar record with men and although these past years have been rather lonely, I welcomed it, it was better than putting myself out there just to get shot down again. I didn\u2019t bother looking and I got rather creative at avoiding my friends meddling in my non-existent love life. They tried to set me up with people before, Terry even asked me if I had changed sides, and the next time we hung out he introduced me to Lauren and hightailed out of there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d He pulled on her hair, bringing her eyes to his. \u201cSo, you and Lauren\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your mind out of the gutter Christopher, nothing happened. She\u2019s a lovely girl, but I\u2019m not bi. We had a few drinks, plotted to kill Terry and parted ways as good friends. She\u2019s married now, her wife is pregnant. It\u2019s a little boy by the way.\u201d Lucy fetched her phone from the coffee table and opened Instagram, showing him a post about a week old.</p><p>\u201cLauren is the brunette?\u201d She nodded and Chris looked at another picture. \u201cWell damn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re imagining it, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry baby, I\u2019m a man after all.\u201d He gave her a very unapologetic grin when she snatched the phone out of his hand. His eyes searched hers and he was serious when he spoke. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had such terrible experiences with dating before. But I\u2019m glad you decided to come to Boston.\u201d</p><p>She smiled radiantly at him.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>They were silent but for Sinatra singing about a white Christmas and Dean Martin crying about letting it snow. Well, he had gotten his wish about half an hour ago, the streets were once again covered in white fluff, thick flocks hitting the large windows panels.</p><p>\u201cI have a really important question for you,\u201d Chris said, stopping the slow massage of her scalp.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026 Okay?\u201d Lucy studied his face, looking for a clue of what that question could be.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen the ring?\u201d He questioned with a serious expression.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, the ring! No, Garret wouldn\u2019t show it to me! It\u2019s on my travel bag and I\u2019m not even allowed to look at it. He actually used that word.\u201d She huffed.</p><p>\u201cCan you believe he wouldn\u2019t show it to me? I\u2019m his best friend, I should at least get a peak before the big day.\u201d Chris trailed off. \u201cOkay, maybe not, but I\u2019m so curious, he wouldn\u2019t tell me anything besides it\u2019s from Tiffany.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked me about Penny\u2019s preferences, so I\u2019m guessing it might be a gold band with a central round diamond in a solitaire style, but Garret would not confirm even that for me. I know he wants Penny to see it before anyone else but come on, gimme the deets, brah!\u201d They laughed together and Chris ribbed her for her terrible Boston accent.</p><p>\u201cGarret\u2019s my best friend. He\u2019s been there for me since my first year of high school, he believed in me when I didn\u2019t.\u201d His forehead creased. \u201cShe\u2019ll say yes, right? I mean, you\u2019re her sister, you must know whether Penny might say yes or no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I know she\u2019ll say yes?\u201d Lucy lifted his shoulder in a half shrug. \u00a0\u201cI mean, I can\u2019t know for sure that a hundred percent Chris, but she\u2019s absolutely and irrevocably in love with Garret since maybe their second date. She called me after he dropped her off and we spent two hours talking, which basically consisted of Penny praising Garret from his eyes to the way he would treat the staff at the restaurant.\u201d Happiness swelled within her when she remembered how excited Penny sounded on the phone.<i> I\u2019m gonna marry him someday babyboo, I just know that</i>. \u201cDo I believe she won\u2019t let him finish the proposal before she starts screaming yes? Absolutely!\u201d</p><p>Chris massaged the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cGod, you scared me for half a second.\u201d Chris chuckled before continuing. \u201cHe was insufferable during the first few months. We\u2019re all over Europe to promote the first Avengers and I asked both him and Guillermo to come with me, so they could keep me company and I wouldn\u2019t be so strung out with anxiety. Garret would get up at 2 am whenever we were so he could call Penny when she got back from work, or she would call him at 5 am her time while we\u2019re pausing for lunch. I told Garret to fly her to Paris so they could meet, impress her with a date on a caf\u00e9 near the Eiffel Tower and she said no, that they weren\u2019t at that point in their relationship yet. That\u2019s when I knew Penny would be perfect for Garret, she wasn\u2019t easily impressed by what his money could buy her. He told me once her favorite type of date included coffee and sitting on a park bench watching their dogs play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad made a point to always impart on us that you shouldn\u2019t measure a person by their wealth but on how well they treat those who do not share it,\u201d Lucy told him. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy to become jaded and lose perspective of how to be a decent human being when you don\u2019t know what it is to struggle to make ends meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d the twinkly lights were playing tricks with her hair, the bright shades of red tangling from Chris\u2019 fingers. He paused to rearrange the strands falling over her eyes, carefully tucking it behind her ears. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m a conceited prick or that my ego needs its own zip code or something but aside from that the various quips about my acting, you never once mentioned me being, well, me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you wanted me to?\u201d Lucy had a hand softly stroking Dodger\u2019s auburn coat while the pooch lay on the floor next to them, his head rolling back and forth after her hand. Her eyes focused on his, studying him. \u201cDid you want me to fangirl and be all over the great Chris Evans, Actor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Must definitely not.\u201d His left hand grabbed hers and brought it to his mouth, lightly kissing her knuckles, drawing in a breath. \u201cIt got harder to make friends or date people outside the industry since Captain America. I knew that would happen, but it sucks sometimes you know? I really don\u2019t like dating actress but\u2026 it\u2019s easier, less messy if you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarret once commented you got really good at smelling fakers.\u201d Lucy sat back up and faced Chris, pulling her legs close to her chest, head resting on her knees.</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s a skill you need to hone very quickly otherwise you\u2019ll live in a world full of people trying to blow smoke up your ass to get something from you. You see this person you want to interact with, be it a girl you wanna hook up with or this dude who talks beer and artisanal cheese and maybe could be a friend, you know, and you approach them, you wanna get to know them, but the minute they see the actor, Chris disappears and Chris Evans, must take his place. That had been my life up to two nights ago. Then you appear and while you did acknowledge the actor, you brushed past him and went straight to Chris.\u201d He got a hold of her hand before continuing, \u201cWe met and didn\u2019t talk much before we were all over each other, and can you really blame me for that? \u2018Cuz look at you\u2026 But when we did talk, you busted my chops about football, you weren\u2019t afraid to tell me to shut up when I needed to, and I fucking loved that, it\u2019s been a while since a girl called me on my shit.\u201d</p><p>She held her right hand over her heart and raised the left one, \u201cI, Lucy Seabrook, hereby promise to always call you on your shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways, huh? That sounds awful like you\u2019d want to spend more time with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I\u2019ve been smitten with you for quite some time Chris.\u201d At his puzzled face, she continued. \u201cAlthough I\u2019ve never come to visit Penny in Boston, she\u2019s been plenty of times to New York. At first, she\u2019d come with a couple of friends, or we\u2019d get together with my friends and consume a lot of alcohol and enjoy a hell of a good time. And one day instead of a couple of girlfriends, she brought Garret. Just a friend, you know, nothing to see here, she said that shit every other phone call, but I knew better. Anyways, Garret had this friend, Chris. And Chris is the coolest guy on the planet; they went snowboarding, they went to Walt Disney World with his family, they went to Vegas and had a hell of good time\u2026 Chris couldn\u2019t be around much, but he was a bro like no other. Garret respects and admires you like a true brother by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mutual,\u201d Chris crossed his leg and turned to her, waiting.</p><p>\u201cSo Chris is a constant on your life even though you never met him; he\u2019s now in the stories your sister tells you as well, he helps at Christopher\u2019s Heaven, donates a good chunk of money to the place. Of course, you\u2019ve seen pictures of everyone, and the guy in the left holding a beer or making a face, that\u2019s Chris, such a fun and down to earth guy, such a great outlook on life. And then one day you\u2019re watching Game of Thrones with your sister and her boyfriend, and hey, isn\u2019t that a tv spot from Winter Soldier? The Captain America guy kinda looks like your friend Chris, Gar and OH.\u201d She shook her head sheepishly. \u201cI fell for you before I met you. Not with the actor, but this great guy named Chris, who happens to act and plays Captain Steve Rogers now and then, who\u2019s friends with my sister and her boyfriend. It does help that he\u2019s crazy good in bed and damn, can make me weak on the knees just by kissing my neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrazy good in bed, huh?\u201d Cupping her face, he softly kisses her lips, hands coaxing her body towards him. Opening her legs, Lucy straddles Chris\u2019 lap, her shirt riding up to expose her bottom and Chris moans when she rubs against his cock through the thin lace and cotton barriers.</p><p>She giggled then, a beautiful sound that made his warmed his whole body. He needed to make sure this was just the first of many, many dates. Chris leaned closer, lips gently brushing hers. He enveloped her small hands with his large ones.</p><p>\u201cI live a hectic life.\u201d His eyes turned serious and he saw a look of worry cross her face. \u201cI can be gone for months at times, sometimes with no break at all. I\u2019m an asshole sometimes, scratch that, most of the time. I\u2019m no prize Lucy, but I really, really wanna see you again.\u201d</p><p>A smile tucked at the corner of her lips, freeing one hand and running her index finger along his forehead, smoothing a frown line that he didn\u2019t know he sported.</p><p>\u201cYou might not believe you are blue ribbon material Chris, but it\u2019s part of my job to judge talents when I encounter them and you, my dear, deserve first place in a lot of categories.\u201d The tips of his ears felt hot at her praise. \u201cI\u2019m hard headed and a workaholic, I spend over eighty hours teaching and training and my brother calls me a mule, that\u2019s how stubborn I am. Having said that, I really, really wanna see you again as well.\u201d</p><p>Chris let of a breath he didn\u2019t know he was holding, a big smile on his face, bringing her close for a hug.</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m blue ribbon material you say?\u201d he moved back to look at her, raising one eyebrow suggestively and tickling her side. \u201cCan I see the judges notes, please? I need to know what my strengths were and where I need to improve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop, stop!\u201d her giggles filled the room and he thought they were the cutest thing. \u201cYou\u2019re such a polpetto Chris!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a polpetto si, a meatball ah?,\u201d his Italian accent sucked, but she laughed harder when he closed his hands in the traditional Italian gesture and shook them exclaiming, \u201cDio santo!\u201d</p><p>She rested her forehead on his naked chest, a hand coming up to trace his clavicle tattoo.</p><p>\u201cIs that all the Italian you know, caro mio?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s about it.\u201d Skilled fingers unbuttoned the shirt she wore, parting the sides to unveil her breasts. His palmed the globes, thumbs skimming the quickly hardening nipples. \u201cWe used to pester Uncle Mike for curse words, but he always told us vaffanculo, so that\u2019s the only one I know.\u201d</p><p>She planted small kisses on his tattoo, the tip of her tongue tracing the words, fingering his pebbled nipples. \u201cVoglio le tue mani su tutto il corpo e la tua testa fra le gambe. Ti piace cozi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what you just said but bring it on baby.\u201d Lucy yelped when his strong hands picked her from his lap and laid her back on the couch, opening her legs with his knees to rest his pelvis against her, a hiss escaping her when his covered cock made contact with her mound. \u201cBring it on.\u201d</p><p>__________________________________________</p><p>\n\nNotes:</p><p>Polpetto \u2013 meatball</p><p>Dio Santo \u2013 oh my god.

                "content": "<p>Chris woke around 8 am, alone in bed and for a moment he panicked, thinking Lucy never actually came home with him last night. A look around the room revealed her suitcase and a large soft luggage bag neatly stacked near his closet, her purse on the nearby chair. The pillow he was hugging still smelled like her shampoo and he smiled at the memory of them showering together and how he had insisted on washing her hair, his hands working the long strands into different hairstyles while she laughed at his portray of a flamboyant hairdresser.</p><p>They&rsquo;d arrived home around 8 pm after Garret read him the riot act while Lucy gathered her stuff. <i>He&rsquo;d better not fuck this up, was he sure he wanted to pursue this? Otherwise he better end their date right there.</i></p><p>Date. Chris scoffed at the word. He was sure Lucy still didn&rsquo;t know the meeting at the game was a set-up arranged by her sister and his best friend; a blind date where only one of them knew they were on a date at all. Penny insisted Lucy wouldn&rsquo;t come if she were to tell her and it was up to Chris to make the move.</p><p>Ever since he wrapped Gifted and came back home complaining he had had enough of the Hollywood dating scene, Penny redoubled her efforts to get Chris and Lucy together. <i>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the sweetest girl, Chris, always there with a smile when I was hurt. She was the first to organize a fundraising and collecting food and clothes after the Mitchell&rsquo;s house fire. She&rsquo;s got the biggest heart of anyone I know and they abused her trust. She&rsquo;s been hurt pretty and she&rsquo;s afraid of trying again. I believe you can change that.&rdquo;</i> Penny said over pizza one day. Chris had his doubts, not sure if he was ready to deal with so much baggage. <i>&ldquo;Would you date her?&rdquo;</i> Chris asked Garret over beers, <i>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s fragile man but she&rsquo;s a special girl. Hell yes, I&rsquo;d date her. She&rsquo;s wicked smart, sassy as hell and can make you laugh like a lunatic plus, she&rsquo;s built like a fifties pin-up girl, all tits, ass, and thighs. You keep saying you want something real, here&rsquo;s your chance at it.&rdquo;</i></p><p>So Chris agreed to the date, picking a football game for their first meeting, a common ground where both could still enjoy themselves if the chemistry wasn&rsquo;t there. Except they hit it off so good that any plans of taking her out for dinner so they could get to know each flew out of the window and now he was working backward to convince her she was more than a one-night stand.</p><p>The moment he left the bedroom Chris could hear Lucy singing downstairs. She wasn&rsquo;t going to win any Grammys but she wasn&rsquo;t bad either. He made his way downstairs carefully as to not alert her of his presence.</p><p>He stopped just before reaching the bottom, watching as Lucy belted the lyrics to an old pop song into a wooden spoon, moving around the kitchen with her eyes closed during the chorus. He watched as she opened and closed his cabinets, a quiet yay reaching his ears when she found a glass bowl, bringing the bowl with her back to the counter where eggs, cheese, sliced potatoes, and condiments all waited. And since when did he own a cast iron pan?</p><p>Lucy sang and danced while she mixed the ingredients, pouring them into the hot pan, her oversized nightshirt hanging loosely on her shoulders, purplish marks dotting her neck. He&rsquo;d never been one to leave them before but with her he was a man possessed, staking a claim so everyone could see she belonged with him. A twinge of jealousy hit him at the thought of a man getting closer enough to look at her neck.</p><p>Chris knew it was probably too early to feel that way but he wasn&rsquo;t concerned with a timetable any more. He&rsquo;d been infatuated with the idea of her for the past month and the reality turned out to be so much better. Their time at the museum yesterday had been fantastic, no awkward silences, no lulls in the conversation. He hanged into her every word, committing to memory every like and dislike she shared, wanting to know everything about the firecracker redhead who danced her way into his life.</p><p>He leaned against the fridge, crossing his arms.</p><p>&ldquo;Is there a cover fee for the show or is it included with breakfast?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That depends, what kind of payment are we talking about?&rdquo; Lucy smiled brightly at him, rinsing her hands.</p><p>&ldquo;I can think of a few ways. I&rsquo;m also known for being a very generous tipper.&rdquo;</p><p>Chris walked over to her, picking up a napkin and drying each individual finger before bringing her hands over his neck, leaning down to gently kiss her.</p><p>&ldquo;Top o&rsquo; the mornin&rsquo; to ya, little lady.&rdquo; He smiled at her when their lips separated, tipping an imaginary hat at her.</p><p>&ldquo;Mornin&rsquo; sir,&rdquo; she giggled and did a little curtsy. &ldquo;Give it 25 minutes and you&rsquo;ll eat the best Spanish omelet of your life.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m starving so it better be good.&rdquo; Chris challenged, letting go of her to fill Dodger&rsquo;s food and water bowl.</p><p>&ldquo;Of your life.&rdquo; She pointed the wood spoon at his retrieving back.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very tall order little lady, I&rsquo;ve been alive for quite some time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Except that, I&rsquo;m older than you.&rdquo; She reminded Chris while she brought the coffee pot and the juice jar to the small breakfast table by the window.</p><p>&ldquo;You know what that makes you, right?&rdquo; He called back to her, already on his way back from the laundry room.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; She moved back to the counter, checking on the food on the stovetop, turning it off and moving the pan to the oven.</p><p>&ldquo;A cougar.&rdquo; He said was behind her, hands circling her waist and bringing her body close to his, his lips closing on the pulse point on her neck and effectively ending the protest on her lips. &ldquo;A very fine,&rdquo; kiss, &ldquo;gorgeous,&rdquo; bite, &ldquo;beautiful cougar.&rdquo;</p><p>He sucked the tender skin where her neck met her shoulder, leaving yet another mark.</p><p>&ldquo;Keep that up and I&rsquo;ll need a scarf inside the house when I get to my parent&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she made no movement to stop him, hands resting over his.</p><p>&ldquo;You have a very biteable neck.&rdquo; Chris kissed the same spot again just to prove a point and she giggled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to curb my inner vampire.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your inner vampire is quite welcome to other places where I can better hide the evidence.&rdquo; Lucy looked back up to him, a hint of mischievousness in her voice.</p><p>His hands immediately moved to cup her breasts over her shirt. &ldquo;Oh, you mean here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uhm&hellip; or here.&rdquo; Lucy&rsquo;s hand gently guided him to the inside of her thighs.</p><p>&ldquo;Your idea is so much better than mine.&rdquo; Chris turned her around and his mouth immediately found hers in a powerful and possessive kiss.</p><p>He was rapidly becoming addicted to her mouth, her lips moving like fine silk on his, tongue searching for him, a delirious chase he couldn&rsquo;t get enough of. He heard her moan against his mouth and it stoked the fire already burning inside of him.</p><p>Chris&rsquo; strong hands clutched Lucy&rsquo;s waist, bringing her closer to his body and in a swift movement he lifted and dropped her at the counter, her body bouncing when she landed.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you crazy, you could throw your back or someth&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>His lips quickly silenced her words and he nipped at her for good measure when they separated.</p><p>&ldquo;I can bench press over 300 pounds Lucy, and you weigh what, a bit more than half that? Let me worry about what I can and I can&rsquo;t handle,&rdquo; his hands slid up her thighs till he finds the white lace cheeky panties she wore, thumbs hooking around the lace and pulling them down as he whispered in her ear. &ldquo;I love how my hands are full of you when I run them up your thighs, when I grab your ass, how your breasts feel heavy on my hands&hellip; and just so you know I&rsquo;d love to fuck them.&rdquo;</p><p>A strangled moan escaped her at his words and she reached for his sweatpants, pushing them down, needing the contact, craving the feel of him. He rocked his hips on her, the head of his cock right on top of her clit, his bare length sliding up and down over her small lips, coating himself in her juices. &ldquo;I want you inside me, Chris.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shhh, I&rsquo;m not finished. Trivia time. Did you know I had a crush on Jessica Rabbit the first time I saw Who Framed Roger Rabbit?&rdquo; Chris unbuttons her shirt, bottom to top, slowly unwrapping her like a present, thrusting against her with each new inch of skin he reveals, her moans spurring him on. &ldquo;To my twelve-year-old self, she was the hottest woman I&rsquo;d ever seen, who cares if she was a cartoon. It was the first time I actively jerked off.&rdquo; He parted the sides of her nightgown, exposing her breast and he licks his lips at the sight of her naked chest. His hands tangle in her hair bringing the red strands around her left shoulder. Her eyes are blown, pupils dilated, almost no green left and he thinks she looked like a fucking goddess at that moment. He stood between her legs, his nose skimming the pulse point on her neck, lips following suit, before stepping back, making her pout for the lack of contact. &ldquo;God, look at you, my personal Jessica Rabbit, pouty lips and all, my fucking wet dream coming true, sinful curves and deliciously naked.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then come here and fuck your Rabbit,&rdquo; she pulled him back, mouths clashing, tongues dancing together. Her hands roamed over the taut muscles of his arms, tracing the veins and kneading the flesh of his shoulders, fingertips caressing the nape of his neck with one hand while the other danced on the planes of his chest, following the trail of hair that led to his cock.</p><p>Lucy planted open-mouthed kisses on his chest, gently biting his right nipple, sucking the small hard nub in her mouth, enthralled by the sounds he made.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, do that again,&rdquo; Chris asked in a low voice and she smiled against his chest, moving to the other side. She flattened her tongue against his nipple before closing her mouth against it, teeth rasping the pebbled skin and sucking hard and at the same time that she closed her hand over him, dragging her fingers over the crown in slow but precise motions. A guttural moan rocked his body and he thrust hard against her hand, pre-come leaking from the bulbous head.</p><p>&ldquo;How did you like it?&rdquo; Lucy grinned up to him, hand fisting over his shaft as she licked around the tattoo on his ribcage.</p><p>&ldquo;That&hellip; god, don&rsquo;t tease,&rdquo; he faltered when her fingers squeezed around him, both hands working in a precise rhythm. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s definitely going into the pro column.&rdquo;</p><p>Her laugh is cut short when he pulls her hair back, covering her mouth with his. Their kisses became long and slow, fueled by their moans, tongues sinfully dancing together as hands travel everywhere; caressing her boobs, touching his ass, tangled in her hair, gripping his waist.</p><p>&ldquo;Lay back on your arms.&rdquo; Chris nudges her back with a soft touch and she obeys, releasing his shaft and arranging herself on the black marble. Fingers and mouth working together, he traces a pattern over her body, stroking over her collarbone, rolling her nipples between expert fingers, dipping his tongue on her belly button. He nips at the small curve of her belly, biting and bruising the skin and smirks at her. &ldquo;No one will see this one, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Considering it&rsquo;s not exactly swimming weather outside, I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; she smiled and shook her head.</p><p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he rubbed his bearded face on her inner thighs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not finished though.&rdquo;</p><p>Warm open-mouthed kisses on the inside of her thighs left her panting and pleading for more.</p><p>&ldquo;Use your words, Lucy.&rdquo; His warm breath tickled her lips, making her squirm.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tease me like that.&rdquo; Wild eyes glanced down, &ldquo;I want your mouth on me. Now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, madam.&rdquo; The feel of his silky tongue made her whole body undulate, a loud gasp echoing in the large room as he bathed her in slow and sure motions. He gave her a wicked grin before his lips closed on her clit, tongue swirling on the taut nerve and her hips lifted, legs jumping wildly. He hooked her left leg over his shoulder for anchorage, grasping the curve of her hips to keep her from moving and her small hand covered his, fingers tangling together. Chris smiled, eyes framed by long eyelashes looking up to her, loving to watch her surrender under his touch. He was lost to the scent of her, the sweet and tangy aroma filling his lungs.</p><p>&ldquo;Chris.&rdquo; A gasp escaped her swollen lips, eyes fluttering close with each pass of his tongue, shallow breaths, and a racing heart.</p><p>&ldquo;God, you&rsquo;re beautiful,&rdquo; His mouth barely leaves her to whisper his adoration. &ldquo;Are you ready for more baby?&rdquo;</p><p>Two fingers sank into her, scissoring and curling against her walls. He devoured her, lips and tongue working her clit, fingers hooked inside her, rubbing that sweet spot inside her over and over. Her hips thrust wildly upward, incomprehensible cries falling from her lips when he sped up his motions, humming his praise, the vibrations on causing the most delicious electric sparks making her legs writhe and sending her dangerously close to the edge.</p><p>Her body grew taut, goosebumps spreading all over and he felt her clenching his fingers, fingernails leaving small crescent shapes on the back of his hand before releasing his hand and threading them around his hair, keeping him where she needed the most.</p><p>&ldquo;So close, oh god, I need&hellip; close.&rdquo;</p><p>His teeth scraped her clit and it&rsquo;s her undoing. Lucy cried out to him, tremors rocking her, legs quivering as he continued to touch her, transforming her orgasm in an ongoing sensation that washed over her back and forth every time his tongues her clit, fingers still moving inside her now with a renewed fervor.</p><p>&ldquo;Give one more baby, I know you have it in you.&rdquo; Another pair of fingers made contact with her clit, rubbing it in a maddening pace as he kisses her inner thighs, bruising the skin with his teeth. He slipped his fingers from inside her pussy, digits coated in her cum, and moved them lower, pressing them lightly against her puckered hole, making contact hard enough to let her know he&rsquo;s there. His tongue enters her, lapping up the escaping slick as his index fingers breached the impossibly tight hole.</p><p>&ldquo;Chris, oh god, oh f&hellip;&rdquo; a second wave hit her and her arm gave out, spasm taking over her body and her eyes rolled to the back of her head, the fire never ending, the darkness threatening to take over.</p><p>She pushed him away, her body spent as she laid on the counter, breathing heavily.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, you look gorgeous when you cum,&rdquo; Chris&rsquo; eyes were zeroed on hers with a smug smile on his face, fingers slowly caressing the skin of her hips. &ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Give me a moment, I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m alive,&rdquo; Lucy closed her eyes, drawing a deep breath, the sound of his laugh making her smile. &ldquo;Yep, I&rsquo;m alive.&rdquo;</p><p>Chris pulled her up and her hands immediately gravitated to his face, bringing him close, kissing his shiny lips, thumbing the moisture on his mustache and bringing it to her mouth, her tongue making a show of licking the digit clean, groaning at the taste of herself on him. He moaned and rocked himself against her core, callused hands curling on the skin of her bottom.</p><p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; Lucy nuzzled his neck, kissing the smooth skin, her nose pressed on his beard, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never let anyone back there before.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never?&rdquo; the whimper is followed by a grunt when she shook her head. &ldquo;Whenever you&rsquo;re ready, let me know, I can make you feel so, so good baby.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How about I think about it and I get back to you on that.&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s a pause before he agreed and dove for her mouth, tongues dueling in a heated kiss, hissing when her hands closed around him, sliding up and down the length with torturous gestures.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never wanted anyone the way I want you,&rdquo; her hands stroked and twisted, creating the perfect amount of pressure that forced him to thrust back searching for more friction. Lucy nibbled his earlobe and murmured, &ldquo;Get inside me Chris, now.&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s a command he&rsquo;s eager to obey and he brings her closer to the edge of the counter, dragging his cock up her slit, making them both moan.</p><p>And then he stopped, looking around for a moment, groaning.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit.&rdquo;</p><p>His low curse made her head pop. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t bring any condoms down with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; The disbelief in her voice made him chuckle.</p><p>More expletives left his mouth as he opened a few drawers before finally admitting defeat with a shake of his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Well little rabbit, for starters my pants didn&rsquo;t have any pockets. Plus, I didn&rsquo;t exactly plan on fucking you on my counter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so sturdy though, it just begs for some action.&rdquo; She bounces a little, grinning at him.</p><p>Chris threw his head back with a laugh, raising both eyebrows at her.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re using me for my kitchen, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Damn, I&rsquo;ve been found,&rdquo; she snapped her fingers with a mocking frown.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on woman, let&rsquo;s go upstairs before&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>The oven pinged, signaling the food was ready.</p><p>&ldquo;That.&rdquo; Chris dropped his head on her shoulder while Lucy tried to contain her mirth, certain he would not appreciate her laughing right now.</p><p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; Lucy glanced from the oven back to him, fingers dancing between the hairs of his chest. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m alright with re-heated food if you are.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, thank fuck.&rdquo; He promptly hoisted her out of the counter, pausing just long enough to pick up his pants from the floor, just to look up and see her running up the stairs.</p><p>Lucy stopped on the middle step, shedding her shirt, calling out to him with her fingers. She squeaked and ran when Chris started after her, taking the steps two at a time, catching up to her right by his bedroom door, caging her body with his.</p><p>&ldquo;Gotcha.&rdquo; Her whole skin prickled with his whisper and she couldn&rsquo;t help the moan that escaped when he bit her earlobe, tugging on the flesh. The feel of him rocking against her as he kissed the back of her neck reduced her to a quivering mess as he opened the door, directing her to the recently made bed.</p><p>Spinning in his arms, she kissed him hard, forcing his body toward the bed. &ldquo;Lay down, keep your hands above your head.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bossy, bossy,&rdquo; Chris kissed her before laying down, making a show of shaking his ass at her, which earned him a playful swat. &ldquo;Careful with the merchandise woman.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucy giggle-snorted, shaking her head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;ll handle all the packages with care.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;See that you do.&rdquo; He winked and got comfortable, holding onto the pillow under his head, licking his lips when she crawled over him, kneeling between his legs.</p><p>Her lips brushed over his brow, nose, and cheeks before touching his mouth, a pink tongue tracing his pouty lips. They kissed with their eyes open, Chris trying to follow her every time she retreated, only to kiss him again when his head hit the pillow with a growl.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be mean. I love kissing you.&rdquo;</p><p>Her eyes crinkled, a smile tugging at the corner of her lips. The next time she didn&rsquo;t pull back, her tongue tangling with his, lips synced in a slow and sensuous dance, making his body buckle when she sucked his tongue, knuckles white from clutching the pillow.</p><p>She teased his neck, caressing the pulse point with her tongue, working her way down his body and Chris felt like fire wafted over his skin with each touch. Stopping over his dusky nipples, she replayed the earlier actions, this time with more teeth and Chris decided the move deserved a whole new column titled &lsquo;fucking brilliant&rsquo;. &nbsp;</p><p>The hard muscles of his abdomen twitched when her teeth made contact, and she soothed him with butterfly kisses over the tattoo on his lower rib cage. The first dip of her tongue into his belly button bucked his hips, the anticipation consuming him as she licked over the thick line of hair connecting to the base of his cock, her nose nuzzling the velvet skin that rested over his lower abdomen.</p><p>&ldquo;Lucy&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Patience Chris.&rdquo;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t have to wait long, a hitched breath meeting the first touch of her tongue on the underside of his erection. She tempted him with one long lick before enveloping the head with her lips, tonguing the slit and tasting the drops of his salty pre-come already there.</p><p>An ache formed deep in his belly when her hands closed around him, pumping up and down the thick member, a thumb pressing the vein on the underside with every downward stroke. She cupped his balls as her mouth descended on him, sucking him slowly into her mouth, working her way down.</p><p>Chris wanted so badly to touch her, to run his hands everywhere while she claimed him, but he was good with following orders. &ldquo;God, you&rsquo;re killing me, Lucy, such a pretty and talented mouth you have, fuck, so good around my cock.&rdquo; He heard and felt her moaning around him, the humming adding to his pleasure, and when she hollowed her cheeks and took him all the way he cursed loudly, body shaking. &ldquo;Please, please let me touch you gorgeous.&rdquo;</p><p>She let him go with a pop, swirling her tongue around the weeping head, flattening her tongue and dragging over his frenulum, wanton eyes, dark and needy, never leaving him when she nodded and took him back into her mouth, her lips sinking until he could feel the back of her throat, grunting and fighting the urge to thrust up. He ran his hands over her shoulders, gentle fingers cupping her cheek while she engulfed him, her nose pressed to the trimmed hairs of his groin.</p><p>His labored breaths were cut by deep moans, pleasure cursing through this body.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not gonna last, baby.&rdquo;</p><p>His hands now played with her hair, gathering it to a side, holding it atop of her head and finally settling with tangling it all in a ponytail so he could watch what her as she worked to bring him to climax. The need to thrust became unbearable, a scorching heat consuming and overwhelming his senses.</p><p>&ldquo;Let it go, Chris,&rdquo; she enticed him and he surrendered, plunging against her mouth, marveling at the feeling of her silky tongue working over him when he retreated.</p><p>Sheer pleasure consumed him, the ache in his belly spreading all over him and he barely had time to warm her of his impending climax. Lucy paid him no mind, lips tight around his cock while two fingers pressed down on the perineum and he lost it, swelling and coating the inside of her mouth, hands tight on her hair to keep her from moving.</p><p>She swallowed and he groaned loudly, curses and moans mixed together while he sang her praises, calling her name over and over. Chris twitched when Lucy licked him clean, letting him go with a final pat to the head of his cock. A smile played on her lips as she gave him a small kiss at the corner of his lips before resting her head on the nook of his neck.</p><p>Chris was quiet for a moment before he let out a whistle.</p><p>&ldquo;Damn.&rdquo;</p><p>Her body shook with contained laughter.</p><p>&ldquo;That good, huh?&rdquo; Lucy drew small patterns on his chest and he rejoiced in the feeling of being so close to her.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck yes.&rdquo; He slowly kissed her, his tongue exploring the swollen lips. A small peck to her nose and he released her.</p><p>A blissful silence fell over them, his hands combing the long locks as she did the same to his beard. They stayed like that for some time, until Chris spoke again.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you have the number for The New York Times?&rdquo; He asked with a serious expression.</p><p>&ldquo;What would you need it for?&rdquo; Lucy side-eyed Chris.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to take out an ad and tell all those fools in New York City how incredibly stupid they are for passing you over. Or I might do a full-page &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; for the exact same reason, I&rsquo;m still undecided.&rdquo; He twisted them both till she was laying on top of him, taking the opportunity to run his hands over her ribcage, waist and finally resting both hands on her bottom, holding them loosely over her flesh.</p><p>&ldquo;All of this over a good blowjob?&rdquo; She chuckled and adjusted herself so her pussy hovered over his hardening cock.</p><p>He shook his head and poked her on the side.</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me, but being on the receiving end of said blowjob I think you meant fantastic. Curl your toes and scream yourself hoarse fantastic,&rdquo; he is delighted when a blush covered not only the face but her breasts as well. He licked his lips and bucked against her, &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m definitely thanking them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your recovering time is quite a feat, Chris.&rdquo; Her hips rocked slowly against him and Lucy left a small sigh when her clit rubbed on the veiny member.</p><p>He tightened his hold on her buttocks as she danced wantonly over him, dragging herself across the hard member.</p><p>&ldquo;I am&hellip; Captain America after all.&rdquo; A shallow moan followed another thrust and he grabbed the condom next to the pillow, ripping the package and handing it to her.</p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the poor the guy a virgin though? Did the whole beefcake flavored popsicle thing before he could get the girl?&rdquo; Lucy scooted back just enough to free him from under her, spreading the wetness she left on his throbbing cock before rolling the latex down.</p><p>He bent her down by her shoulders, bracing one arm around her waist while the other holds her close, hands gripping her neck.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna pretend you just didn&rsquo;t call Cap a virgin beefcake flavored popsicle, alright?&rdquo; He preened when she giggled and it occurred to him how much time had passed since sex was this poignant and so carefree at the same time. Lucy brought a whole new game to the table; sexy, fun, extremely hot and addictive, just like her.</p><p>He ran his nose on the thick vein there, kissing up to her ear, nibbling on the flesh. &ldquo;Can I fuck you now little rabbit?&rdquo;</p><p>God how he loved how he could make her body flush and shiver with just a few words. Chris&rsquo; lips covered hers in a scorching kiss, tongues clashing before Lucy righted her body and positioned herself over him.</p><p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; she hissed as Chris pinched her nipples, &ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;m the one doing the fucking now.&rdquo;</p><p>Hungry eyes met as she eased down on him, never breaking eye contact till she is flushed on his lap, throwing her head back with a lustful moan.</p><p>&ldquo;God Chris, I&rsquo;m so full of you.&rdquo; She stilled for a moment, getting used to the sensation.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so tight baby, I can feel every bit of your pussy hugging me.&rdquo; He moaned breathily when she squeezed him, hands flying to her thighs and rear. &ldquo;You gonna wreck me just by doing that and then you won&rsquo;t get to cum.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t have that now, can we?&rdquo; Lucy rolled her hips in a slow movement, keeping most of his cock inside her as she rocked side to side, smiling provocatively at the groans coming from Chris.</p><p>Hands sprawled over his large chest as leverage, Lucy impressed a hard pace, pulling all the way up and slamming back down with slow circles that had her eyes rolling to the back of her head, the head of Chris&rsquo; cock hitting her g-spot with every downward movement.</p><p>Holding the soft flesh on the back of her thighs, Chris met her thrusts with his own, grinding her down on his pelvis. He shifted so his feet were flat against the mattress, starting a pattern of quick and shallow thrusts that made Lucy drop her head to her heaving chest, her hair falling around them like a curtain as her hands clang to his shoulders, fingernails digging into the muscles, moaning and sobbing.</p><p>Walls clenching around him, he could sense that she was close, her mouth forming a delicate o shape, eyes closed in ecstasy. Every nerve ending is alive and bursting with energy, all connected to the spot where his cock entered her and she gasped, air heavily leaving her lungs when waves of pleasure crashed into her, chants of his name is like a song to his ears.</p><p>&ldquo;God, Chris!&rdquo; She screamed his name, dropping to kiss him, her tongue sweeping over his. &ldquo;Fuck, you make me feel so good.&rdquo;</p><p>Drawing circles up here sides, he held her closer, fingers flexing in her waist.</p><p>&ldquo;Rabbit, we&rsquo;re barely getting started. On your back.&rdquo; Chris grunted as he lifted her, her juices making his cock glisten. &ldquo;Fuck, look at that&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>He touched her slick clit when she settled on her back, making her shudder, aftershocks rocking her body with a strangled moan.</p><p>&ldquo;Fucking gorgeous. Your body was made for me, to love it, to worship it. I&rsquo;m gonna fuck you so good baby.&rdquo; He got on his knees, bringing her hips level with his, propping her ass up with a discarded pillow.</p><p>&ldquo;Chris, please. I need you.&rdquo;</p><p>The air is charged with the faint aroma of sex as Chris hovers over her. The caveman inside his brain growled with the need to possess her, make her theirs.</p><p>&ldquo;You need my cock? You need me to pound you and make you forget your own name?&rdquo; His voice is hoarse with lust, eyes blown. He brought her legs up, resting her feet on his shoulders, his member nested on her folds. &nbsp;&ldquo;I can do that rabbit, I&rsquo;ll fuck you raw, ruin you for anyone else but me. Do you want that?&rdquo;</p><p>He rocks against her, the crown of his shaft sliding over her clit and she keens, a high-pitched sound that snaps something inside him. He enters her roughly, bottoming out on the first thrust, establishing a hard pace. His moans echo around the room when he sees her holding her breasts, pinching her erect nipples.</p><p>&ldquo;I want that, yes, I want you. Fuck me, Chris, yes, yes.&rdquo; Wanton eyes look over at him and he almost lost it, driving into her with and making the headboard hit the wall in a staccato of thrusts.</p><p>One of her legs fell to the side when he let it go and it curled around his knees, keeping his vision unobstructed. Watching his cock disappear inside her is a glorious sight and Chris can barely tear his eyes away to look up, but he was glad he did. Lucy had her arms above her, head thrown to the side, eyes closed and her teeth are dug so hard into her lips he swore she would draw blood at any moment. Her labored breath and moans follow the rhythm of his hips and once in a while she would let a loud wail when he hit that perfect spot inside her.</p><p>The goosebumps are back, his brows furrowed and he had to fight to keep his eyes open, the pleasure coursing through him is too much.</p><p>&ldquo;Eyes on me Lucy.&rdquo; Chris told her in a slow growl and smiled when dark green orbs focus on him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the most beautiful thing in the world. I can feel you&rsquo;re close baby, cum for me.&rdquo;</p><p>A thumb is pressed to her clit, rubbing small circles on the hardened nub, propelling her to the end. Lucy gripped the sheets, back bowing from the mattress, calling for him as her body convulsed.</p><p>His own release is there, his powerful thighs clenching as his hips still, her name on his lips, a powerful climax washing over him.</p><p>Breathing heavily, Chris laid down on top of her, holding himself up in his forearms, searching her face only to find her smiling at him, a lazy grin that made his heart flutter.</p><p>&ldquo;That was&hellip;&rdquo; slender fingers pushed the sweaty hair out of his forehead and Lucy kissed his cheek, lips lingered on the scruff.</p><p>&ldquo;Intense? Incredible? Impeccable? Impressive? Illegal?&rdquo; Chris would have continued but her clasped hand in front of his mouth stopped him.</p><p>&ldquo;Illegal?&rdquo; Lucy laughed.</p><p>He licked her palm and she yelped, removing it quickly and giving him a dirty look. He grinned.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it is somewhere, you were pretty loud after all.&rdquo;</p><p>He rolled over from her, leaving the bed to deal with the condom.</p><p>&ldquo;And whose fault is that <i>Mister Dirty Talk Extraordinaire</i>?&rdquo; She called after him.</p><p>&ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m gonna feel guilty about making you scream my name?&rdquo; He gave her a skeptical look as he came back with a damp hand towel, running it carefully over her.</p><p>&ldquo;Incorrigible. There&rsquo;s another one for you.&rdquo; She stretched and Chris drank on her body. The sight of her naked and pliable in his bed was now ranked top ten in the list of his favorite things.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s play a game.&rdquo; Chris reclined on the headboard with his legs sprawled on the bed, white sheets covering his lower body. Lucy was on her stomach next to him, hands resting on her chin, feet up and crossed at the ankles, her naked form enticing him. His eyes followed the curves of her back, stopping to admire the tattoo that covered most of her right side, back dipping to form her waist before coming back up to the most amazing ass he&rsquo;d ever seem, and yes, he had seen more than most men. He needed a distraction otherwise he&rsquo;d pounce on her again. &ldquo;Two truths, one lie.&rdquo; When she looked at him quizzically, he explained, &ldquo;We each tell the other two truths about ourselves and make up a lie, a believable one. The other person has to guess what the lie is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do we get if we get the lie right?&rdquo; she rearranged herself on the bed and he groaned when the movements gave him a better look of her breasts. She caught the look on his eyes and smirked, wagging a finger at him. &ldquo;Bad Chris, stay down boy. Stopping ogling the girls.&rdquo; She giggled, looking around, finally grabbing a pillow that had been pushed to the edge of the bed and using it as a cover.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve turned me into a fiend, it&rsquo;s your own sexy fault.&rdquo; He pouted when the pillow obstructed the view and he drew a breath to try and clear his mind. A sly smile graced his face, he knew exactly what to bet on. &ldquo;How about this, three rounds. Winner gets to pick and plan a future date, loser can&rsquo;t say no to the date no matter what the plan is.&rdquo;</p><p>Her eyes got big when she understood exactly what that meant. <i>Yeah baby, you&rsquo;re not escaping so easily from me.</i></p><p>&ldquo;And I can plan any date I like? Picnic, fly a kite, bungee-jumping?&rdquo; she licked her lips, wide-eyed with all the possibilities but then hesitated, &ldquo;Are you even allowed to bungee-jump? I mean, don&rsquo;t you signed a contract stating you must look pretty and can&rsquo;t do anything that might break a bone and halt productions?&rdquo;</p><p>Chris threw his head back in laughter, this girl was amazing, so open and earnest, with no agenda, just a gorgeous girl genuinely interested in him.</p><p>&ldquo;Kevin might have a problem with the last one, but sure, whatever you plan.&rdquo; He admitted, enthralled by the possibilities. A B&amp;B on a vineyard near the coast where they could spend the whole day naked and tangled in each other, only coming out to see the sun setting and to find a small restaurant to eat. A cabin in the woods, lots of pillows scattered around the floor in front of a crackling fireplace. A four-day weekend in Italy, sightseeing near Verona and Genova, drinking wine and holding hands without anyone bothering them. Any of the scenarios had amazing appeal, he just needed to make sure he&rsquo;d have a chance to make them come to life.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine, let&rsquo;s play,&rdquo; she grinned. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going skinny dipping at Otsego Lake, just so you know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is that supposed to scare me? I&rsquo;d love to go skinny dipping with you.&rdquo; Chris waggled his eyebrow at her. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s an easy one; I played quarterback in high school and we were county champions. My favorite color is blue but sky blue, like on a summer day. I once fooled my brother into peeing his own pants in front of our nanny.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Leave it to you to describe a color like you&rsquo;re in the middle of a romcom. That&rsquo;s one truth.&rdquo; She smiled when he nodded. &ldquo;Uhm. You&rsquo;re crazy about football and golly, could you ever be so mean? Yikes. But then again, you were banned from the museum&hellip;&rdquo; She tapped her fingers to her mouth. &ldquo;Nah, you would&rsquo;ve told me that yesterday, so that&rsquo;s the lie, no one is that mean.&rdquo;</p><p>He made a horn-like sound, shouting &ldquo;WRONG!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What! Oh my god, you&rsquo;re a terrible person Christopher,&rdquo; her mouth drops in disbelief. &ldquo;Your poor, poor brother!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I truly was the worst brother ever when it came to pranks.&rdquo; He had a smirk on his face</p><p>&ldquo;Remind me to never go on a prank war with you, Mr. Evans. And here I am imagining you&rsquo;re star quarterback, getting all cozy with the head cheerleader and being crowned Prom King.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As if. I was the scrawny kid from Drama Class, joined the lacrosse team to kiss up to dad. I was actually dumped at prom!&rdquo; At her incredulous face, he laughed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, we&rsquo;re at this party and she said I was too immature and deluded if I thought the acting gig would pay off. But I did get &lsquo;Most Likely to Die Doing Something Stupid&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, she must hate herself right about now.&rdquo; Lucy chuckled. &ldquo;Have you ever saw her again after that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not personally, but she works at Lincoln-Sudbury High, Carly has told me she gloats that I took her to prom and never mentions that she left me alone to cry in my neighbor&rsquo;s front lawn.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The cheekiness of the woman! Next time you do an interview, rattle her out, let&rsquo;s see how she feels about that.&rdquo;</p><p>Chris loved that she feels indignant on his behalf.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, your turn little lady.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see. I&rsquo;m ambidextrous, my handwriting looks exactly the same no matter which hand I use. &nbsp;I was once part of a girl band named The Fantastic Four, no correlation to your movie at all. I&rsquo;m terrified of clowns to the point of hyperventilating.&rdquo;</p><p>The grin on his face was almost maniacal. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to plan our date.&rdquo;</p><p>She eyed him with distrust. &ldquo;No way you know it that easily.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What, you think I don&rsquo;t know you usurped the girl band story from Penny?&rdquo;</p><p>Her mouth dropped. &ldquo;NO! How could you know that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually pure dumb luck and the fact that I have a great memory.&rdquo; He confessed. &ldquo;A bunch of us went to Mayfair at Harvard Square back in May and they had a food truck called The Fantastic Flour. I tried my best to ignore the jokes and steered clear of the place. Penny, on the other hand, insisted it was destiny and told us about her garage band. For some reason, it stuck with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re no fun!&rdquo; She complained with a smile. &ldquo;That was my best fake story, I can&rsquo;t bluff to save my life!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You must suck at poker then,&rdquo; Chris smirked. &ldquo;Next time we&rsquo;re playing strip-poker.&rdquo;</p><p>She laughed long and hard before he pounced on her, throwing the pillow she was using to cover herself to the side of the bed and dragging her naked body on top of his, tickling her sides. They tumbled around in the bed, sharing a long kiss and Chris saw the moment her pupils dilated. God, he wanted to have her again, she was an addiction he could freely partake in but now wasn&rsquo;t the time. No, there are things that need to be discussed, they couldn&rsquo;t spend these few hours fucking each other, as lovely as that thought was.</p><p>&ldquo;How about we go see if that omelet is still warm enough?&rdquo; He helped her up from the bed, giving her a terry cloth robe that was way to bigger for her and put it on another one.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for coming back home with me last night. I&rsquo;ve had more fun in the past two days than most of this past year.&rdquo; He hugged her after tying a loose knot on the robe.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for asking me to come back.&rdquo; She cupped his cheek and stroked his beard. &ldquo;I really liked spending time with you, Chris. Us meeting was the highlight of a somewhat insipid year.&rdquo;</p><p>A deer in headlights. That was most likely the look he sported now. He knew this conversation was coming, but still, he dreaded it.</p><p>&ldquo;Uhm. About that. We need to talk.&rdquo;</p><p>-.-.-.-.-.-.-</p><p>One cold Spanish Omelet and three cups of coffee later, Chris and Lucy sat on the family room sofa. He lounged lazily on the chase with Lucy laying down across him, her head on his lap. His phone was docked on the side table, Christmas music coming from hidden speakers around the living room, Chris had turned on the lights of his Christmas tree and the twinkling lights played around them.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure you&rsquo;re okay about the whole blind date thing?&rdquo; Chris inquired, slowly combing her hair, a small gesture he was learning she loved and he enjoyed doing it for her.</p><p>&ldquo;Do I still want to kill Penny? Sure do. I might push her from our dock into the frozen waters of Otsego lake at least once while we&rsquo;re back home but I know her heart was in the right place. She was right, I wouldn&rsquo;t have come if she told me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And why not? Was the idea of meeting me that bad?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo; Lucy cradled the hand that rested on her belly but didn&rsquo;t look up at him. &ldquo;I have a less than stellar record with men and although these past years have been rather lonely, I welcomed it, it was better than putting myself out there just to get shot down again. I didn&rsquo;t bother looking and I got rather creative at avoiding my friends meddling in my non-existent love life. They tried to set me up with people before, Terry even asked me if I had changed sides, and the next time we hung out he introduced me to Lauren and hightailed out of there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; He pulled on her hair, bringing her eyes to his. &ldquo;So, you and Lauren&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Get your mind out of the gutter Christopher, nothing happened. She&rsquo;s a lovely girl, but I&rsquo;m not bi. We had a few drinks, plotted to kill Terry and parted ways as good friends. She&rsquo;s married now, her wife is pregnant. It&rsquo;s a little boy by the way.&rdquo; Lucy fetched her phone from the coffee table and opened Instagram, showing him a post about a week old.</p><p>&ldquo;Lauren is the brunette?&rdquo; She nodded and Chris looked at another picture. &ldquo;Well damn.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re imagining it, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, sorry baby, I&rsquo;m a man after all.&rdquo; He gave her a very unapologetic grin when she snatched the phone out of his hand. His eyes searched hers and he was serious when he spoke. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you had such terrible experiences with dating before. But I&rsquo;m glad you decided to come to Boston.&rdquo;</p><p>She smiled radiantly at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Me too.&rdquo;</p><p>They were silent but for Sinatra singing about a white Christmas and Dean Martin crying about letting it snow. Well, he had gotten his wish about half an hour ago, the streets were once again covered in white fluff, thick flocks hitting the large windows panels.</p><p>&ldquo;I have a really important question for you,&rdquo; Chris said, stopping the slow massage of her scalp.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip; Okay?&rdquo; Lucy studied his face, looking for a clue of what that question could be.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you seen the ring?&rdquo; He questioned with a serious expression.</p><p>&ldquo;What? Oh, the ring! No, Garret wouldn&rsquo;t show it to me! It&rsquo;s on my travel bag and I&rsquo;m not even allowed to look at it. He actually used that word.&rdquo; She huffed.</p><p>&ldquo;Can you believe he wouldn&rsquo;t show it to me? I&rsquo;m his best friend, I should at least get a peak before the big day.&rdquo; Chris trailed off. &ldquo;Okay, maybe not, but I&rsquo;m so curious, he wouldn&rsquo;t tell me anything besides it&rsquo;s from Tiffany.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He asked me about Penny&rsquo;s preferences, so I&rsquo;m guessing it might be a gold band with a central round diamond in a solitaire style, but Garret would not confirm even that for me. I know he wants Penny to see it before anyone else but come on, gimme the deets, brah!&rdquo; They laughed together and Chris ribbed her for her terrible Boston accent.</p><p>&ldquo;Garret&rsquo;s my best friend. He&rsquo;s been there for me since my first year of high school, he believed in me when I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; His forehead creased. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll say yes, right? I mean, you&rsquo;re her sister, you must know whether Penny might say yes or no.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do I know she&rsquo;ll say yes?&rdquo; Lucy lifted his shoulder in a half shrug. &nbsp;&ldquo;I mean, I can&rsquo;t know for sure that a hundred percent Chris, but she&rsquo;s absolutely and irrevocably in love with Garret since maybe their second date. She called me after he dropped her off and we spent two hours talking, which basically consisted of Penny praising Garret from his eyes to the way he would treat the staff at the restaurant.&rdquo; Happiness swelled within her when she remembered how excited Penny sounded on the phone.<i> I&rsquo;m gonna marry him someday babyboo, I just know that</i>. &ldquo;Do I believe she won&rsquo;t let him finish the proposal before she starts screaming yes? Absolutely!&rdquo;</p><p>Chris massaged the back of his neck.</p><p>&ldquo;God, you scared me for half a second.&rdquo; Chris chuckled before continuing. &ldquo;He was insufferable during the first few months. We&rsquo;re all over Europe to promote the first Avengers and I asked both him and Guillermo to come with me, so they could keep me company and I wouldn&rsquo;t be so strung out with anxiety. Garret would get up at 2 am whenever we were so he could call Penny when she got back from work, or she would call him at 5 am her time while we&rsquo;re pausing for lunch. I told Garret to fly her to Paris so they could meet, impress her with a date on a caf&eacute; near the Eiffel Tower and she said no, that they weren&rsquo;t at that point in their relationship yet. That&rsquo;s when I knew Penny would be perfect for Garret, she wasn&rsquo;t easily impressed by what his money could buy her. He told me once her favorite type of date included coffee and sitting on a park bench watching their dogs play.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dad made a point to always impart on us that you shouldn&rsquo;t measure a person by their wealth but on how well they treat those who do not share it,&rdquo; Lucy told him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so easy to become jaded and lose perspective of how to be a decent human being when you don&rsquo;t know what it is to struggle to make ends meet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can I ask you something?&rdquo; the twinkly lights were playing tricks with her hair, the bright shades of red tangling from Chris&rsquo; fingers. He paused to rearrange the strands falling over her eyes, carefully tucking it behind her ears. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to think I&rsquo;m a conceited prick or that my ego needs its own zip code or something but aside from that the various quips about my acting, you never once mentioned me being, well, me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you wanted me to?&rdquo; Lucy had a hand softly stroking Dodger&rsquo;s auburn coat while the pooch lay on the floor next to them, his head rolling back and forth after her hand. Her eyes focused on his, studying him. &ldquo;Did you want me to fangirl and be all over the great Chris Evans, Actor?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. Must definitely not.&rdquo; His left hand grabbed hers and brought it to his mouth, lightly kissing her knuckles, drawing in a breath. &ldquo;It got harder to make friends or date people outside the industry since Captain America. I knew that would happen, but it sucks sometimes you know? I really don&rsquo;t like dating actress but&hellip; it&rsquo;s easier, less messy if you will.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Garret once commented you got really good at smelling fakers.&rdquo; Lucy sat back up and faced Chris, pulling her legs close to her chest, head resting on her knees.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. It&rsquo;s a skill you need to hone very quickly otherwise you&rsquo;ll live in a world full of people trying to blow smoke up your ass to get something from you. You see this person you want to interact with, be it a girl you wanna hook up with or this dude who talks beer and artisanal cheese and maybe could be a friend, you know, and you approach them, you wanna get to know them, but the minute they see the actor, Chris disappears and Chris Evans, must take his place. That had been my life up to two nights ago. Then you appear and while you did acknowledge the actor, you brushed past him and went straight to Chris.&rdquo; He got a hold of her hand before continuing, &ldquo;We met and didn&rsquo;t talk much before we were all over each other, and can you really blame me for that? &lsquo;Cuz look at you&hellip; But when we did talk, you busted my chops about football, you weren&rsquo;t afraid to tell me to shut up when I needed to, and I fucking loved that, it&rsquo;s been a while since a girl called me on my shit.&rdquo;</p><p>She held her right hand over her heart and raised the left one, &ldquo;I, Lucy Seabrook, hereby promise to always call you on your shit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Always, huh? That sounds awful like you&rsquo;d want to spend more time with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do. I&rsquo;ve been smitten with you for quite some time Chris.&rdquo; At his puzzled face, she continued. &ldquo;Although I&rsquo;ve never come to visit Penny in Boston, she&rsquo;s been plenty of times to New York. At first, she&rsquo;d come with a couple of friends, or we&rsquo;d get together with my friends and consume a lot of alcohol and enjoy a hell of a good time. And one day instead of a couple of girlfriends, she brought Garret. Just a friend, you know, nothing to see here, she said that shit every other phone call, but I knew better. Anyways, Garret had this friend, Chris. And Chris is the coolest guy on the planet; they went snowboarding, they went to Walt Disney World with his family, they went to Vegas and had a hell of good time&hellip; Chris couldn&rsquo;t be around much, but he was a bro like no other. Garret respects and admires you like a true brother by the way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mutual,&rdquo; Chris crossed his leg and turned to her, waiting.</p><p>&ldquo;So Chris is a constant on your life even though you never met him; he&rsquo;s now in the stories your sister tells you as well, he helps at Christopher&rsquo;s Heaven, donates a good chunk of money to the place. Of course, you&rsquo;ve seen pictures of everyone, and the guy in the left holding a beer or making a face, that&rsquo;s Chris, such a fun and down to earth guy, such a great outlook on life. And then one day you&rsquo;re watching Game of Thrones with your sister and her boyfriend, and hey, isn&rsquo;t that a tv spot from Winter Soldier? The Captain America guy kinda looks like your friend Chris, Gar and OH.&rdquo; She shook her head sheepishly. &ldquo;I fell for you before I met you. Not with the actor, but this great guy named Chris, who happens to act and plays Captain Steve Rogers now and then, who&rsquo;s friends with my sister and her boyfriend. It does help that he&rsquo;s crazy good in bed and damn, can make me weak on the knees just by kissing my neck.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Crazy good in bed, huh?&rdquo; Cupping her face, he softly kisses her lips, hands coaxing her body towards him. Opening her legs, Lucy straddles Chris&rsquo; lap, her shirt riding up to expose her bottom and Chris moans when she rubs against his cock through the thin lace and cotton barriers.</p><p>She giggled then, a beautiful sound that made his warmed his whole body. He needed to make sure this was just the first of many, many dates. Chris leaned closer, lips gently brushing hers. He enveloped her small hands with his large ones.</p><p>&ldquo;I live a hectic life.&rdquo; His eyes turned serious and he saw a look of worry cross her face. &ldquo;I can be gone for months at times, sometimes with no break at all. I&rsquo;m an asshole sometimes, scratch that, most of the time. I&rsquo;m no prize Lucy, but I really, really wanna see you again.&rdquo;</p><p>A smile tucked at the corner of her lips, freeing one hand and running her index finger along his forehead, smoothing a frown line that he didn&rsquo;t know he sported.</p><p>&ldquo;You might not believe you are blue ribbon material Chris, but it&rsquo;s part of my job to judge talents when I encounter them and you, my dear, deserve first place in a lot of categories.&rdquo; The tips of his ears felt hot at her praise. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hard headed and a workaholic, I spend over eighty hours teaching and training and my brother calls me a mule, that&rsquo;s how stubborn I am. Having said that, I really, really wanna see you again as well.&rdquo;</p><p>Chris let of a breath he didn&rsquo;t know he was holding, a big smile on his face, bringing her close for a hug.</p><p>&ldquo;So, I&rsquo;m blue ribbon material you say?&rdquo; he moved back to look at her, raising one eyebrow suggestively and tickling her side. &ldquo;Can I see the judges notes, please? I need to know what my strengths were and where I need to improve.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stop, stop!&rdquo; her giggles filled the room and he thought they were the cutest thing. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a polpetto Chris!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a polpetto si, a meatball ah?,&rdquo; his Italian accent sucked, but she laughed harder when he closed his hands in the traditional Italian gesture and shook them exclaiming, &ldquo;Dio santo!&rdquo;</p><p>She rested her forehead on his naked chest, a hand coming up to trace his clavicle tattoo.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that all the Italian you know, caro mio?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s about it.&rdquo; Skilled fingers unbuttoned the shirt she wore, parting the sides to unveil her breasts. His palmed the globes, thumbs skimming the quickly hardening nipples. &ldquo;We used to pester Uncle Mike for curse words, but he always told us vaffanculo, so that&rsquo;s the only one I know.&rdquo;</p><p>She planted small kisses on his tattoo, the tip of her tongue tracing the words, fingering his pebbled nipples. &ldquo;Voglio le tue mani su tutto il corpo e la tua testa fra le gambe. Ti piace cozi?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have no idea what you just said but bring it on baby.&rdquo; Lucy yelped when his strong hands picked her from his lap and laid her back on the couch, opening her legs with his knees to rest his pelvis against her, a hiss escaping her when his covered cock made contact with her mound. &ldquo;Bring it on.&rdquo;</p><p>__________________________________________</p><p>\n\nNotes:</p><p>Polpetto &ndash; meatball</p><p>Dio Santo &ndash; oh my god. Use lots of hands gesture when using this one!</p><p>Caro mio &ndash; my dear, my love</p><p>Vaffanculo &ndash; up your ass, mostly a light version of fuck you.</p><p>Voglio le tue mani su tutto il corpo e la tua testa fra le gambe.

                "content_abstract": "<p>Chris woke around 8 am, alone in bed and for a moment he panicked, thinking Lucy never actually came home with him last night. A look around the room revealed her suitcase and a large soft luggage bag neatly stacked near his closet, her purse on the nearby chair. The pillow he was hugging still smelled like her shampoo and he smiled at the memory of them showering together and how he had insisted on washing her hair, his hands working the long strands into different hairstyles while she laughed at his portray of a flamboyant hairdresser.</p>",

Alexander \nPierce is their leader. The S.T.R.I.K.E. and Insight crew are HYDRA as \nwell. I don\u2019t know how many more, but I know they\u2019re in the building. \nThey could be standing right next to you. They almost have what they \nwant. Absolute control. They shot Nick Fury. And it won\u2019t end there. If \nyou launch those helicarriers today, HYDRA will be able to kill anyone \nthat stands in their way. Unless we stop them. I know I\u2019m asking a lot. \nBut the price of freedom is high. It always has been. And it\u2019s a price \nI\u2019m willing to pay. And if I\u2019m the only one, then so be it.
