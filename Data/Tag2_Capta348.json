I only went\nfor Scooby-Doo comics, but when they stopped selling them I stopped looking at\nand buying comics all together. In this dark period \u00a0I did start going to fan conventions where I\nwould pick up old back issue comics, especially X-Men and Fantastic Four. This\nhelped curb my need for comics, but it proved prove not to be enough. When I\ngraduated high school, I decided to take a year off, and in this year was when\nI entered my first comic book store.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I had\nbeen wanting to get back into comic books, but I didn\u2019t know where to start. I\nwas following Marvel on twitter when I saw they posted about a character named\nCaptain Marvel. Now I had been out of touch with comics for quite some time,\nthe only female superheroes I really knew were those featured in X-Men, just characters\nonly part of a group, not with their own separate comic. Clinking on the\narticle I saw two new writers are attached to a new Captain Marvel arc. This\narc would lead Captain Marvel into Civil War Two with Iron Man (after becoming <b>obsessed </b>with Captain Marvel I\nlater divulged in Kelly Sue DeConnick\u2019s run of the character and fell in love\nwith her work). \u00a0Continuing on, this\nlittle article about Captain Marvel got me hooked, I started to read more about\nwho she was, and about her comic book history. By the end of several Google\nsearches I knew I had to have this comic. This is where fate stepped in. On the\nother side of town I knew there was a small comic book shop. And around this\ntime my brother had \u00a0started studying for\nhis nursing exam. Now this seems completely unrelated but to study my brother\nwould go to the library which was right near the little comic book shop! It\ntook a little convincing for him to let me tag along, but he gave in and I was\non my way to my first comic book shop! </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I\nwalk into this small store, with white walls filled with posters and lined with\nold book and magazine shelves. It lined the left wall all the way to the back,\nin the middle were tables and other shelves carrying a variety of other books.\nOn the right was a little counter with a dated cash register, there wasn\u2019t even\na computer. In fact the whole store seem pretty dated but to me it added to its\ncharm. In truth it was all very overwhelming, the place was filled with\neverything comic book related. There was no one else in the store besides me\nand an employee. He greeted me kindly and let me to my own devices. I breathed\nslightly better, I was grateful he didn\u2019t quiz me on the origins of Captain\nMarvel or stare me down to make me feel like I didn\u2019t belong. I knew all too\nwell the stereotypes of a woman being in a comic book store. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It\nwas difficult to find the issue of Captain Marvel I wanted, I didn\u2019t even know\nabout New Comic Book day or that the series was already three issues deep.\nAfter figuring out the alphabetical system in its messy shelves, I finally\nfound Captain Marvel. There were several back issues, which threw me off a bit but\nby remembering that the new arc included our beloved Carol with short hair I\nfound it no time. Well I found the third issue, but I grabbed it quickly and\ntriumphantly. My first comic book from a comic book store. After securing the\nissue under my arms I walked about the store in no rush, taking in the\ndifferent titles and quirky things about the store. I had a lot of research to\ndo, there were some titles and characters that jumped out at me I made a mental\nnote for later. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally,\nI completed my journey around the store, the man rung through my comic and I\nwalked out feeling happy and excited about the new things I would discover\nthrough comics. There would be many, and I am sure there are still more to come\nfor me. I felt like a belonged to something again, being off school for a year\ncan make you feel lonely. I met my brother at the library and sat in a desk\nnear to him and I began reading the comic, despite it being the third issue. I\ntore through it, excited for the next time I\u2019ll get to go back to the comic\nbook shop (which was the very next week). \u00a0 </p>",

I only went\nfor Scooby-Doo comics, but when they stopped selling them I stopped looking at\nand buying comics all together. In this dark period \u00a0I did start going to fan conventions where I\nwould pick up old back issue comics, especially X-Men and Fantastic Four. This\nhelped curb my need for comics, but it proved prove not to be enough. When I\ngraduated high school, I decided to take a year off, and in this year was when\nI entered my first comic book store.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I had\nbeen wanting to get back into comic books, but I didn\u2019t know where to start. I\nwas following Marvel on twitter when I saw they posted about a character named\nCaptain Marvel. Now I had been out of touch with comics for quite some time,\nthe only female superheroes I really knew were those featured in X-Men, just characters\nonly part of a group, not with their own separate comic. Clinking on the\narticle I saw two new writers are attached to a new Captain Marvel arc. This\narc would lead Captain Marvel into Civil War Two with Iron Man (after becoming <b>obsessed </b>with Captain Marvel I\nlater divulged in Kelly Sue DeConnick\u2019s run of the character and fell in love\nwith her work). \u00a0Continuing on, this\nlittle article about Captain Marvel got me hooked, I started to read more about\nwho she was, and about her comic book history. By the end of several Google\nsearches I knew I had to have this comic. This is where fate stepped in. On the\nother side of town I knew there was a small comic book shop. And around this\ntime my brother had \u00a0started studying for\nhis nursing exam. Now this seems completely unrelated but to study my brother\nwould go to the library which was right near the little comic book shop! It\ntook a little convincing for him to let me tag along, but he gave in and I was\non my way to my first comic book shop! </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I\nwalk into this small store, with white walls filled with posters and lined with\nold book and magazine shelves. It lined the left wall all the way to the back,\nin the middle were tables and other shelves carrying a variety of other books.\nOn the right was a little counter with a dated cash register, there wasn\u2019t even\na computer. In fact the whole store seem pretty dated but to me it added to its\ncharm. In truth it was all very overwhelming, the place was filled with\neverything comic book related. There was no one else in the store besides me\nand an employee. He greeted me kindly and let me to my own devices. I breathed\nslightly better, I was grateful he didn\u2019t quiz me on the origins of Captain\nMarvel or stare me down to make me feel like I didn\u2019t belong. I knew all too\nwell the stereotypes of a woman being in a comic book store. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It\nwas difficult to find the issue of Captain Marvel I wanted, I didn\u2019t even know\nabout New Comic Book day or that the series was already three issues deep.\nAfter figuring out the alphabetical system in its messy shelves, I finally\nfound Captain Marvel. There were several back issues, which threw me off a bit but\nby remembering that the new arc included our beloved Carol with short hair I\nfound it no time. Well I found the third issue, but I grabbed it quickly and\ntriumphantly. My first comic book from a comic book store. After securing the\nissue under my arms I walked about the store in no rush, taking in the\ndifferent titles and quirky things about the store. I had a lot of research to\ndo, there were some titles and characters that jumped out at me I made a mental\nnote for later. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally,\nI completed my journey around the store, the man rung through my comic and I\nwalked out feeling happy and excited about the new things I would discover\nthrough comics. There would be many, and I am sure there are still more to come\nfor me. I felt like a belonged to something again, being off school for a year\ncan make you feel lonely. I met my brother at the library and sat in a desk\nnear to him and I began reading the comic, despite it being the third issue. I\ntore through it, excited for the next time I\u2019ll get to go back to the comic\nbook shop (which was the very next week). \u00a0 </p>",
