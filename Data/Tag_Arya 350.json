        "body": "<h1>The Corruption of Rickon Stark (And Other Happenings)</h1><p><b>THE CORRUPTION OF RICKON STARK (AND OTHER HAPPENINGS) </b> </p><p>In all of her sixteen years of life, Arya Lyanna Stark has never been as mad at her siblings as she is at this very moment.</p><p>For some godforsaken reason, her family seemed oblivious to the invention of knocking. An unfortunate genetic trait that was particularly irksome when all five of her beloved siblings (and Theon) had decided to come barging into her room at 3:02 PM on a Sunday when they were all supposed to be out of the house.</p><p>Arya had been playing music (because nothing sets the mood like Green Day) so when her siblings had come home to ask her if she wanted to go and see a movie with them, she had been a bit preoccupied.</p><p>Mainly with Gendry. And his abs.</p><p>Her family really did have the worst timing.</p><p>For a moment, everyone froze.</p><p>Arya sat perched on a shirtless Gendry&rsquo;s lap, both their lips were swollen from kissing.</p><p>And then all hell broke loose.</p><p>Gendry half shoves half catapults her off of him. He frantically looked around for his shirt, which has a habit of continually disappearing (which may or may not be Arya&rsquo;s fault. They were really comfy. And shirtless Gendry was her favorite Gendry).</p><p>When he heard the sound of dogs barking and saw the murderous looks on his friends&rsquo; faces, he gave up on finding his shirt, instead of climbing out Arya&rsquo;s second story window and onto the Weirwood tree before hitting the ground running, sprinting to the safety of his truck.</p><p>To say Jon and Robb were a bit upset was like saying Robert Baratheon was a bit overweight.</p><p>They were furious.</p><p>Robb was pacing the length of her room, looking ready to punch something while Jon was growling. Literally.</p><p>Sansa had immediately gone to cover Rickon&rsquo;s eyes, saying he was too young and innocent to be corrupted by this. Rickon kept trying to push her hands out of the way, claiming that he knew what kissing was.</p><p>Bran then oh so helpfully pointed out that Arya and Gendry had been doing a bit more kissing, and that had they arrived a few minutes they probably would have been doing a lot more than kissing.</p><p>Next time he came home from the Reeds stoned, she was totally ratting him out to their mother.</p><p>After Gendry&rsquo;s daring escape, Sansa released Rickon, and stands there center of it all, giving Arya a disapproving look that was a perfect imitation of the one Catelyn Stark had patented a long time ago.</p><p>Oh like Sansa was a saint.</p><p>&ldquo;Would everyone just shut up!&rdquo; Arya yells. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like any of you have to room to be judging me! I&rsquo;m the only one here in a stable relationship you hypocrites!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Both of you lied to us!&rdquo; Jon protest.</p><p>Robb&rsquo;s eyes widen, and his face pales, making his freckles stand out even more than usual. &ldquo;Seven hells! That girl we&rsquo;ve been teasing him about\u2026 He had scratch marks on his back!&rdquo; He starts shaking his head, eyes frantic. &ldquo;Nope, nope, nope. Not happening. Ew. Oh images, bad, bad images! Make it stop! Make it stop!&rdquo;</p><p>Theon grins. &ldquo;Kinky.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya gives him a lovely view of her middle finger in response, while Sansa looks scandalized.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s our best friends, and you&rsquo;re our baby sister! Don&rsquo;t you think you should have told us?&rdquo; Jon asks, his voice rising with every word.</p><p>&ldquo;Considering how well you&rsquo;re reacting right now?

You should even know that word!&rdquo; Jon stammers.</p><p>He shrugs. &ldquo;I know what it is. When two have special feelings-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Sansa screeches. &ldquo;Who corrupted you, my sweet summer child?&rdquo;</p><p>Rickon rolls his cobalt eyes. &ldquo;Who do you think?

He&rsquo;s been basically living here for the past decade and still hasn&rsquo;t learned how to whisper.&rdquo;</p><p>Robb looks halfway between horrified and scandalized.</p><p>&ldquo;You know what?&rdquo; Theon says, nervously rubbing the back of his neck, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just gonna go\u2026&rdquo; he trails off before sprinting out of the room, down the stairs, and out the front door.</p><p>Jon turns to Robb, a hopeful look on his face. &ldquo;Does this mean I finally get to kill Greyjoy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, Robb will never let you, not matter Theon does.&rdquo; They all turn to look at Arya, who had been momentarily forgotten in the chaos of Rickon&rsquo;s revelation.</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Jon asks, looking disappointed.</p><p>&ldquo;Because the two of them,&rdquo; Arya says pointing to Robb and Sansa, &ldquo;are gay for their best friends. Robb&rsquo;s not about to just let you kill the boy he&rsquo;s been in love with since freaking kindergarten, and Sansa and Margaery are too busy singing each other&rsquo;s praises to come up with a plan to keep you from getting caught.&rdquo; Robb&rsquo;s face goes as red as his hair, and for once in her life, Sansa does not have the perfect response.</p><p>Arya then directs her glare at Jon, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just pissed off that Gendry actually managed to grow a pair and make a move. After all this time, and her literally propositioning you. You&rsquo;re still making excuses about why not to ask Ygritte out and have an actual relationship with her, just because you&rsquo;re afraid. So, instead, you settle for your hand and copious amounts of sexual tension, and we all have to suffer your moodiness.&rdquo;</p><p>She then turns her wrath to Bran, who has been looking far too comfortable with all this and Arya&rsquo;s not about to let that stand. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t even know which Reed siblings you&rsquo;re into.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Probably both,&rdquo; she hears Rickon mutter under his breath. Despite all the mayhem, Arya can&rsquo;t help but smile to herself. Rickon has always been a savage.</p><p>(He did learn from the best).</p><p>Arya turns on her youngest brother, who has been trying (and failing) not to giggle at his older siblings discomfort/embarrassment. &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t worry baby brother, I haven&rsquo;t forgotten about you.&rdquo; A predatory smirk crosses over Arya&rsquo;s slightly swollen lips. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think I haven&rsquo;t noticed you following Shireen Baratheon around with puppy dog eyes that could rival Shaggy&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>Despite the fact, that age eleven, Rickon was already a full inch taller than his sixteen-year-old sister, he suddenly feels much smaller in comparison.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear any of you judging me or my relationship until you have a functional one of your own.&rdquo; And with that, the shortest of the Starks stomps down the hallway, slamming the front door behind her.</p><p>She continues stomping all the way down the driveway and halfway down her street to where Gendry has parked, trying (and failing) to camouflage his bright red truck against the bushes. She hops into the pickup truck, happily noting that he still hasn&rsquo;t managed to find a shirt.</p><p>The petite girl climbs onto his lap and makes herself comfortable. Gendry looks around nervously. &ldquo;What happened? Did Robb and Jon graphically describe my imminent death? Is Theon helping because he knows some sketchy people, and if Robb asked he would do it in a heartbeat. Is Sansa plotting my demise? Seven hells, is she getting Margaery to help? Those two are bloody scary together. Did Bran do that mildly creepy smile of his where you have no idea what he thinks so you&rsquo;re mind comes up with all the worst case scenarios? Is his gangly stoner friend going to give some ideas? Did Rickon threaten to have Shaggy chew my pretty face off? Because I was scared when he threatened that last week, despite the twenty bucks, you gave him to keep quiet.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya rolls her eyes at her ridiculous, well-muscled, extremely tall boyfriend. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s prepubescent.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still holding to the fact that he is the most terrifying out of all of your siblings.&rdquo;</p><p>She gives his head a condescending pat. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I won&rsquo;t let my eleven-year-old brother beat you up. I happen to be quite fond of your pretty face. Helps to make up for you acting stupid. And no, none of my siblings will be plotting your death anytime soon. I gave them something else to focus on.&rdquo; Arya smirks that terrifying smirk of hers that usually means someone is going down in a terrifying and poignantly ironic way.</p><p>Gendry gives a sideways glance at his girlfriend of four and a half months. &ldquo;Do I even want to know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo; Arya replies, popping the &lsquo;p.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re bloody terrifying sometimes, y'know that?&rdquo;</p><p>Arya&rsquo;s smirk widens at the comment. &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of hot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mhmm,&rdquo; She replies absently, trailing her fingers down his chest. &ldquo;Who would have thought that I would end up being the emotionally stable one?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not me.&rdquo; He quips with a grin, which quickly wiped off his face when Arya lands a punch on his arm. &ldquo;Ow! Bloody hell Arry, was that really necessary?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, it was. Now, are we going to finish what we started before we were so rudely interrupted or what?&rdquo; Arya asks, climbing into his lap.</p><p>&ldquo;As mi-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fucking say it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;-lady commands.&rdquo;</p><p>Gendry is rewarded with yet another punch to his arm. &ldquo;Again unnecessary,&rdquo; he pouts, rubbing his bicep.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s what you get for being a stupid bull. Repeat it, and you won&rsquo;t be getting any for a week.&rdquo;</p><p>Gendry smirks. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t resist me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s cocky.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I am, baby girl.&rdquo;</p><p>He places a kiss just below her pulse point causing Arya let out a soft sigh. &ldquo;Especially after what Ygritte let slip to me when she was drunk last night. In between her cursing Jon for his inability to grow a pair and naming all the things she would like to do to said pair should he grow one, she may have mentioned a conversation you two had a few weeks back.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya&rsquo;s face is beginning to match her sibling&rsquo;s hair. Arya was starting to regret letting Ygritte prod her for details about Gendry. At the time it had seemed like a good idea. It was either talk about what she did with Gendry or hear about all the kinky things the wild girl wanted to do with her brother. Now Arya wished that she had let the redhead scar for her life.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to kill her.&rdquo;</p><p>It was a well-known fact that Drunk Ygritte had no filter and her favorite topic of conversation was sex. Which was also right when she was sober, but it was amplified by alcohol.</p><p>&ldquo;I believe she mentioned something about abs of steel?&rdquo;</p><p>Arya&rsquo;s cheeks were now flaming hotter than Ygritte&rsquo;s hair and libido. Gendry felt a rush of pride at the fact that he had made the bold and unflappable Arya Stark blush. It was nice to have the upper hand for once and not be the one flailing. And besides, the brunette looked absolutely adorable with her red cheeks and wide eyes.</p><p>Arya had had him wrapped around her little finger for years without even realizing it, which always seemed to end up with him in embarrassing situations that ranged from her wrestling him to the ground to borrowing his shirt to sleep in, and having very few boundaries.</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As milady-&rdquo;</p><p>She&rsquo;s kissing him before he had a chance to finish the sentence.</p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F15186926&amp;t=NjNlMzYxOGFkNTRiMjdkMzY5NzBiNTNmZmQ3NjAyNzM1ZjRkM2IwNixjYzQ4MWE5NThlZGM0MzcwMGYwNDFiNzkxOGQ4MWUwMWQ4YTRkYTU1\">AO3</a></p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanfiction.net%2Fs%2F12992360%2F1%2FThe-Corruption-of-Rickon-Stark-And-Other-Happenings&amp;t=YTNkZjQ3YjcyNDhlMWIzNmQ0MmNkYWIxMDUzODhjZjRjMzE0YmZlMCwzOWVkZmQ5MzcxZTFlMmRmMzY1N2U3ZmU2ZDcxZGFjNzA3YTI5ZTdl\">fanfiction.net</a></p>",

            "comment": "<p><h1>The Corruption of Rickon Stark (And Other Happenings)</h1><p><b>THE CORRUPTION OF RICKON STARK (AND OTHER HAPPENINGS) </b> </p><p>In all of her sixteen years of life, Arya Lyanna Stark has never been as mad at her siblings as she is at this very moment.</p><p>For some godforsaken reason, her family seemed oblivious to the invention of knocking. An unfortunate genetic trait that was particularly irksome when all five of her beloved siblings (and Theon) had decided to come barging into her room at 3:02 PM on a Sunday when they were all supposed to be out of the house.</p><p>Arya had been playing music (because nothing sets the mood like Green Day) so when her siblings had come home to ask her if she wanted to go and see a movie with them, she had been a bit preoccupied.</p><p>Mainly with Gendry. And his abs.</p><p>Her family really did have the worst timing.</p><p>For a moment, everyone froze.</p><p>Arya sat perched on a shirtless Gendry\u2019s lap, both their lips were swollen from kissing.</p><p>And then all hell broke loose.</p><p>Gendry half shoves half catapults her off of him. He frantically looked around for his shirt, which has a habit of continually disappearing (which may or may not be Arya\u2019s fault. They were really comfy. And shirtless Gendry was her favorite Gendry).</p><p>When he heard the sound of dogs barking and saw the murderous looks on his friends\u2019 faces, he gave up on finding his shirt, instead of climbing out Arya\u2019s second story window and onto the Weirwood tree before hitting the ground running, sprinting to the safety of his truck.</p><p>To say Jon and Robb were a bit upset was like saying Robert Baratheon was a bit overweight.</p><p>They were furious.</p><p>Robb was pacing the length of her room, looking ready to punch something while Jon was growling. Literally.</p><p>Sansa had immediately gone to cover Rickon\u2019s eyes, saying he was too young and innocent to be corrupted by this. Rickon kept trying to push her hands out of the way, claiming that he knew what kissing was.</p><p>Bran then oh so helpfully pointed out that Arya and Gendry had been doing a bit more kissing, and that had they arrived a few minutes they probably would have been doing a lot more than kissing.</p><p>Next time he came home from the Reeds stoned, she was totally ratting him out to their mother.</p><p>After Gendry\u2019s daring escape, Sansa released Rickon, and stands there center of it all, giving Arya a disapproving look that was a perfect imitation of the one Catelyn Stark had patented a long time ago.</p><p>Oh like Sansa was a saint.</p><p>\u201cWould everyone just shut up!\u201d Arya yells. \u201cIt\u2019s not like any of you have to room to be judging me! I\u2019m the only one here in a stable relationship you hypocrites!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth of you lied to us!\u201d Jon protest.</p><p>Robb\u2019s eyes widen, and his face pales, making his freckles stand out even more than usual. \u201cSeven hells! That girl we\u2019ve been teasing him about\u2026 He had scratch marks on his back!\u201d He starts shaking his head, eyes frantic. \u201cNope, nope, nope. Not happening. Ew. Oh images, bad, bad images! Make it stop! Make it stop!\u201d</p><p>Theon grins. \u201cKinky.\u201d</p><p>Arya gives him a lovely view of her middle finger in response, while Sansa looks scandalized.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s our best friends, and you\u2019re our baby sister! Don\u2019t you think you should have told us?\u201d Jon asks, his voice rising with every word.</p><p>\u201cConsidering how well you\u2019re reacting right now? No.\u201d</p><p>Theon snickers at that. \u201cShe has a point.\u201d</p><p>Jon glares at him. \u201cShut up, Greyjoy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBite me, Snow.\u201d</p><p>Their argument is cut off by the only thing they have in common. \u201cYou\u2019re our baby sister!\u201d Robb screeches, frantically waving his hands in the air. \u201cThat\u2019s, like, cradling robbing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a year and a half older than me so it could hardly be classified as robbing. And it\u2019s perfectly legal, I checked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what exactly did you check Arya?\u201d Sansa asks, finally speaking, her voice dangerously calm.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>The last thing Arya needed was to admit in front of her overprotective, borderline cavemen, older brothers were that she googled the age of consent when she had Gendry has started dating four months ago.</p><p>But she was Arya Stark, and she didn\u2019t back down. Besides, Arya liked watching her brothers squirm.</p><p>She crosses her arms over her chest and arches an eyebrow. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>And with that comment, the eldest of Stark pack start yelling over each other.</p><p>\u201cBastard-\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaking advantage-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t own a shirt-\u201d</p><p>\u201cCastrate\u2026 rusty knife-\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex-crazed fiend-\u201d</p><p>Sansa quickly covers Rickon\u2019s ears at the mention of S-E-X.</p><p>\u201cFor the old gods and the new, would you two idiots, please stop?\u201d Sansa hisses, nodding her head at Rickon in a failed attempt at subtly. \u201cThere are innocent children present.\u201d</p><p>Rickon wriggles out of Sansa\u2019s grip. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I hear this?\u201d he demands, hands stubbornly set on his hips. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about anyways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we talking about, Rick?\u201d Robb asks, perfectly confident in their littlest brother\u2019s ignorance.</p><p>\u201cSex.\u201d</p><p>Sansa looks like she\u2019s about to faint.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ten! You should even know that word!\u201d Jon stammers.</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cI know what it is. When two have special feelings-\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Sansa screeches. \u201cWho corrupted you, my sweet summer child?\u201d</p><p>Rickon rolls his cobalt eyes. \u201cWho do you think? I grew up with Theon. He\u2019s been basically living here for the past decade and still hasn\u2019t learned how to whisper.\u201d</p><p>Robb looks halfway between horrified and scandalized.</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d Theon says, nervously rubbing the back of his neck, \u201cI\u2019m just gonna go\u2026\u201d he trails off before sprinting out of the room, down the stairs, and out the front door.</p><p>Jon turns to Robb, a hopeful look on his face. \u201cDoes this mean I finally get to kill Greyjoy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Robb will never let you, not matter Theon does.\u201d They all turn to look at Arya, who had been momentarily forgotten in the chaos of Rickon\u2019s revelation.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Jon asks, looking disappointed.</p><p>\u201cBecause the two of them,\u201d Arya says pointing to Robb and Sansa, \u201care gay for their best friends. Robb\u2019s not about to just let you kill the boy he\u2019s been in love with since freaking kindergarten, and Sansa and Margaery are too busy singing each other\u2019s praises to come up with a plan to keep you from getting caught.\u201d Robb\u2019s face goes as red as his hair, and for once in her life, Sansa does not have the perfect response.</p><p>Arya then directs her glare at Jon, \u201cYou\u2019re just pissed off that Gendry actually managed to grow a pair and make a move.

An unfortunate genetic trait that was particularly irksome when all five of her beloved siblings (and Theon) had decided to come barging into her room at 3:02 PM on a Sunday when they were all supposed to be out of the house.</p><p>Arya had been playing music (because nothing sets the mood like Green Day) so when her siblings had come home to ask her if she wanted to go and see a movie with them, she had been a bit preoccupied.</p><p>Mainly with Gendry. And his abs.</p><p>Her family really did have the worst timing.</p><p>For a moment, everyone froze.</p><p>Arya sat perched on a shirtless Gendry\u2019s lap, both their lips were swollen from kissing.</p><p>And then all hell broke loose.</p><p>Gendry half shoves half catapults her off of him. He frantically looked around for his shirt, which has a habit of continually disappearing (which may or may not be Arya\u2019s fault. They were really comfy. And shirtless Gendry was her favorite Gendry).</p><p>When he heard the sound of dogs barking and saw the murderous looks on his friends\u2019 faces, he gave up on finding his shirt, instead of climbing out Arya\u2019s second story window and onto the Weirwood tree before hitting the ground running, sprinting to the safety of his truck.</p><p>To say Jon and Robb were a bit upset was like saying Robert Baratheon was a bit overweight.</p><p>They were furious.</p><p>Robb was pacing the length of her room, looking ready to punch something while Jon was growling. Literally.</p><p>Sansa had immediately gone to cover Rickon\u2019s eyes, saying he was too young and innocent to be corrupted by this. Rickon kept trying to push her hands out of the way, claiming that he knew what kissing was.</p><p>Bran then oh so helpfully pointed out that Arya and Gendry had been doing a bit more kissing, and that had they arrived a few minutes they probably would have been doing a lot more than kissing.</p><p>Next time he came home from the Reeds stoned, she was totally ratting him out to their mother.</p><p>After Gendry\u2019s daring escape, Sansa released Rickon, and stands there center of it all, giving Arya a disapproving look that was a perfect imitation of the one Catelyn Stark had patented a long time ago.</p><p>Oh like Sansa was a saint.</p><p>\u201cWould everyone just shut up!\u201d Arya yells. \u201cIt\u2019s not like any of you have to room to be judging me! I\u2019m the only one here in a stable relationship you hypocrites!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth of you lied to us!\u201d Jon protest.</p><p>Robb\u2019s eyes widen, and his face pales, making his freckles stand out even more than usual. \u201cSeven hells! That girl we\u2019ve been teasing him about\u2026 He had scratch marks on his back!\u201d He starts shaking his head, eyes frantic. \u201cNope, nope, nope. Not happening. Ew. Oh images, bad, bad images! Make it stop! Make it stop!\u201d</p><p>Theon grins. \u201cKinky.\u201d</p><p>Arya gives him a lovely view of her middle finger in response, while Sansa looks scandalized.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s our best friends, and you\u2019re our baby sister! Don\u2019t you think you should have told us?\u201d Jon asks, his voice rising with every word.</p><p>\u201cConsidering how well you\u2019re reacting right now? No.\u201d</p><p>Theon snickers at that. \u201cShe has a point.\u201d</p><p>Jon glares at him. \u201cShut up, Greyjoy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBite me, Snow.\u201d</p><p>Their argument is cut off by the only thing they have in common. \u201cYou\u2019re our baby sister!\u201d Robb screeches, frantically waving his hands in the air. \u201cThat\u2019s, like, cradling robbing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a year and a half older than me so it could hardly be classified as robbing. And it\u2019s perfectly legal, I checked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what exactly did you check Arya?\u201d Sansa asks, finally speaking, her voice dangerously calm.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>The last thing Arya needed was to admit in front of her overprotective, borderline cavemen, older brothers were that she googled the age of consent when she had Gendry has started dating four months ago.</p><p>But she was Arya Stark, and she didn\u2019t back down. Besides, Arya liked watching her brothers squirm.</p><p>She crosses her arms over her chest and arches an eyebrow. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>And with that comment, the eldest of Stark pack start yelling over each other.</p><p>\u201cBastard-\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaking advantage-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t own a shirt-\u201d</p><p>\u201cCastrate\u2026 rusty knife-\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex-crazed fiend-\u201d</p><p>Sansa quickly covers Rickon\u2019s ears at the mention of S-E-X.</p><p>\u201cFor the old gods and the new, would you two idiots, please stop?\u201d Sansa hisses, nodding her head at Rickon in a failed attempt at subtly. \u201cThere are innocent children present.\u201d</p><p>Rickon wriggles out of Sansa\u2019s grip. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I hear this?\u201d he demands, hands stubbornly set on his hips. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about anyways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we talking about, Rick?\u201d Robb asks, perfectly confident in their littlest brother\u2019s ignorance.</p><p>\u201cSex.\u201d</p><p>Sansa looks like she\u2019s about to faint.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ten! You should even know that word!\u201d Jon stammers.</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cI know what it is. When two have special feelings-\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Sansa screeches. \u201cWho corrupted you, my sweet summer child?\u201d</p><p>Rickon rolls his cobalt eyes. \u201cWho do you think? I grew up with Theon. He\u2019s been basically living here for the past decade and still hasn\u2019t learned how to whisper.\u201d</p><p>Robb looks halfway between horrified and scandalized.</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d Theon says, nervously rubbing the back of his neck, \u201cI\u2019m just gonna go\u2026\u201d he trails off before sprinting out of the room, down the stairs, and out the front door.</p><p>Jon turns to Robb, a hopeful look on his face. \u201cDoes this mean I finally get to kill Greyjoy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Robb will never let you, not matter Theon does.\u201d They all turn to look at Arya, who had been momentarily forgotten in the chaos of Rickon\u2019s revelation.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Jon asks, looking disappointed.</p><p>\u201cBecause the two of them,\u201d Arya says pointing to Robb and Sansa, \u201care gay for their best friends. Robb\u2019s not about to just let you kill the boy he\u2019s been in love with since freaking kindergarten, and Sansa and Margaery are too busy singing each other\u2019s praises to come up with a plan to keep you from getting caught.\u201d Robb\u2019s face goes as red as his hair, and for once in her life, Sansa does not have the perfect response.</p><p>Arya then directs her glare at Jon, \u201cYou\u2019re just pissed off that Gendry actually managed to grow a pair and make a move. After all this time, and her literally propositioning you. You\u2019re still making excuses about why not to ask Ygritte out and have an actual relationship with her, just because you\u2019re afraid. So, instead, you settle for your hand and copious amounts of sexual tension, and we all have to suffer your moodiness.\u201d</p><p>She then turns her wrath to Bran, who has been looking far too comfortable with all this and Arya\u2019s not about to let that stand. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t even know which Reed siblings you\u2019re into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably both,\u201d she hears Rickon mutter under his breath. Despite all the mayhem, Arya can\u2019t help but smile to herself. Rickon has always been a savage.</p><p>(He did learn from the best).</p><p>Arya turns on her youngest brother, who has been trying (and failing) not to giggle at his older siblings discomfort/embarrassment. \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry baby brother, I haven\u2019t forgotten about you.\u201d A predatory smirk crosses over Arya\u2019s slightly swollen lips. \u201cDon\u2019t think I haven\u2019t noticed you following Shireen Baratheon around with puppy dog eyes that could rival Shaggy\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Despite the fact, that age eleven, Rickon was already a full inch taller than his sixteen-year-old sister, he suddenly feels much smaller in comparison.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear any of you judging me or my relationship until you have a functional one of your own.\u201d And with that, the shortest of the Starks stomps down the hallway, slamming the front door behind her.</p><p>She continues stomping all the way down the driveway and halfway down her street to where Gendry has parked, trying (and failing) to camouflage his bright red truck against the bushes. She hops into the pickup truck, happily noting that he still hasn\u2019t managed to find a shirt.</p><p>The petite girl climbs onto his lap and makes herself comfortable. Gendry looks around nervously. \u201cWhat happened? Did Robb and Jon graphically describe my imminent death? Is Theon helping because he knows some sketchy people, and if Robb asked he would do it in a heartbeat. Is Sansa plotting my demise? Seven hells, is she getting Margaery to help? Those two are bloody scary together. Did Bran do that mildly creepy smile of his where you have no idea what he thinks so you\u2019re mind comes up with all the worst case scenarios? Is his gangly stoner friend going to give some ideas? Did Rickon threaten to have Shaggy chew my pretty face off? Because I was scared when he threatened that last week, despite the twenty bucks, you gave him to keep quiet.\u201d</p><p>Arya rolls her eyes at her ridiculous, well-muscled, extremely tall boyfriend. \u201cHe\u2019s prepubescent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still holding to the fact that he is the most terrifying out of all of your siblings.\u201d</p><p>She gives his head a condescending pat. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t let my eleven-year-old brother beat you up. I happen to be quite fond of your pretty face. Helps to make up for you acting stupid. And no, none of my siblings will be plotting your death anytime soon. I gave them something else to focus on.\u201d Arya smirks that terrifying smirk of hers that usually means someone is going down in a terrifying and poignantly ironic way.</p><p>Gendry gives a sideways glance at his girlfriend of four and a half months. \u201cDo I even want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Arya replies, popping the \u2018p.\u2019</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bloody terrifying sometimes, y'know that?\u201d</p><p>Arya\u2019s smirk widens at the comment. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhmm,\u201d She replies absently, trailing her fingers down his chest. \u201cWho would have thought that I would end up being the emotionally stable one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me.\u201d He quips with a grin, which quickly wiped off his face when Arya lands a punch on his arm. \u201cOw! Bloody hell Arry, was that really necessary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it was. Now, are we going to finish what we started before we were so rudely interrupted or what?\u201d Arya asks, climbing into his lap.</p><p>\u201cAs mi-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201c-lady commands.\u201d</p><p>Gendry is rewarded with yet another punch to his arm. \u201cAgain unnecessary,\u201d he pouts, rubbing his bicep.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s what you get for being a stupid bull. Repeat it, and you won\u2019t be getting any for a week.\u201d</p><p>Gendry smirks. \u201cYou can\u2019t resist me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s cocky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I am, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>He places a kiss just below her pulse point causing Arya let out a soft sigh. \u201cEspecially after what Ygritte let slip to me when she was drunk last night. In between her cursing Jon for his inability to grow a pair and naming all the things she would like to do to said pair should he grow one, she may have mentioned a conversation you two had a few weeks back.\u201d</p><p>Arya\u2019s face is beginning to match her sibling\u2019s hair. Arya was starting to regret letting Ygritte prod her for details about Gendry. At the time it had seemed like a good idea. It was either talk about what she did with Gendry or hear about all the kinky things the wild girl wanted to do with her brother. Now Arya wished that she had let the redhead scar for her life.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill her.\u201d</p><p>It was a well-known fact that Drunk Ygritte had no filter and her favorite topic of conversation was sex. Which was also right when she was sober, but it was amplified by alcohol.</p><p>\u201cI believe she mentioned something about abs of steel?\u201d</p><p>Arya\u2019s cheeks were now flaming hotter than Ygritte\u2019s hair and libido. Gendry felt a rush of pride at the fact that he had made the bold and unflappable Arya Stark blush. It was nice to have the upper hand for once and not be the one flailing. And besides, the brunette looked absolutely adorable with her red cheeks and wide eyes.</p><p>Arya had had him wrapped around her little finger for years without even realizing it, which always seemed to end up with him in embarrassing situations that ranged from her wrestling him to the ground to borrowing his shirt to sleep in, and having very few boundaries.</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs milady-\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s kissing him before he had a chance to finish the sentence.</p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F15186926&amp;t=NjNlMzYxOGFkNTRiMjdkMzY5NzBiNTNmZmQ3NjAyNzM1ZjRkM2IwNixjYzQ4MWE5NThlZGM0MzcwMGYwNDFiNzkxOGQ4MWUwMWQ4YTRkYTU1\">AO3</a></p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanfiction.net%2Fs%2F12992360%2F1%2FThe-Corruption-of-Rickon-Stark-And-Other-Happenings&amp;t=YTNkZjQ3YjcyNDhlMWIzNmQ0MmNkYWIxMDUzODhjZjRjMzE0YmZlMCwzOWVkZmQ5MzcxZTFlMmRmMzY1N2U3ZmU2ZDcxZGFjNzA3YTI5ZTdl\">fanfiction.net</a></p></p>",

Rickon has always been a savage.</p><p>(He did learn from the best).</p><p>Arya turns on her youngest brother, who has been trying (and failing) not to giggle at his older siblings discomfort/embarrassment. &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t worry baby brother, I haven&rsquo;t forgotten about you.&rdquo; A predatory smirk crosses over Arya&rsquo;s slightly swollen lips. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think I haven&rsquo;t noticed you following Shireen Baratheon around with puppy dog eyes that could rival Shaggy&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>Despite the fact, that age eleven, Rickon was already a full inch taller than his sixteen-year-old sister, he suddenly feels much smaller in comparison.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear any of you judging me or my relationship until you have a functional one of your own.&rdquo; And with that, the shortest of the Starks stomps down the hallway, slamming the front door behind her.</p><p>She continues stomping all the way down the driveway and halfway down her street to where Gendry has parked, trying (and failing) to camouflage his bright red truck against the bushes. She hops into the pickup truck, happily noting that he still hasn&rsquo;t managed to find a shirt.</p><p>The petite girl climbs onto his lap and makes herself comfortable. Gendry looks around nervously. &ldquo;What happened? Did Robb and Jon graphically describe my imminent death? Is Theon helping because he knows some sketchy people, and if Robb asked he would do it in a heartbeat. Is Sansa plotting my demise? Seven hells, is she getting Margaery to help? Those two are bloody scary together. Did Bran do that mildly creepy smile of his where you have no idea what he thinks so you&rsquo;re mind comes up with all the worst case scenarios? Is his gangly stoner friend going to give some ideas? Did Rickon threaten to have Shaggy chew my pretty face off? Because I was scared when he threatened that last week, despite the twenty bucks, you gave him to keep quiet.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya rolls her eyes at her ridiculous, well-muscled, extremely tall boyfriend. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s prepubescent.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still holding to the fact that he is the most terrifying out of all of your siblings.&rdquo;</p><p>She gives his head a condescending pat. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I won&rsquo;t let my eleven-year-old brother beat you up. I happen to be quite fond of your pretty face. Helps to make up for you acting stupid. And no, none of my siblings will be plotting your death anytime soon. I gave them something else to focus on.&rdquo; Arya smirks that terrifying smirk of hers that usually means someone is going down in a terrifying and poignantly ironic way.</p><p>Gendry gives a sideways glance at his girlfriend of four and a half months. &ldquo;Do I even want to know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo; Arya replies, popping the &lsquo;p.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re bloody terrifying sometimes, y'know that?&rdquo;</p><p>Arya&rsquo;s smirk widens at the comment. &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of hot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mhmm,&rdquo; She replies absently, trailing her fingers down his chest. &ldquo;Who would have thought that I would end up being the emotionally stable one?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not me.&rdquo; He quips with a grin, which quickly wiped off his face when Arya lands a punch on his arm. &ldquo;Ow! Bloody hell Arry, was that really necessary?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, it was. Now, are we going to finish what we started before we were so rudely interrupted or what?&rdquo; Arya asks, climbing into his lap.</p><p>&ldquo;As mi-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fucking say it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;-lady commands.&rdquo;</p><p>Gendry is rewarded with yet another punch to his arm. &ldquo;Again unnecessary,&rdquo; he pouts, rubbing his bicep.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s what you get for being a stupid bull. Repeat it, and you won&rsquo;t be getting any for a week.&rdquo;</p><p>Gendry smirks. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t resist me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s cocky.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I am, baby girl.&rdquo;</p><p>He places a kiss just below her pulse point causing Arya let out a soft sigh. &ldquo;Especially after what Ygritte let slip to me when she was drunk last night. In between her cursing Jon for his inability to grow a pair and naming all the things she would like to do to said pair should he grow one, she may have mentioned a conversation you two had a few weeks back.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya&rsquo;s face is beginning to match her sibling&rsquo;s hair. Arya was starting to regret letting Ygritte prod her for details about Gendry. At the time it had seemed like a good idea. It was either talk about what she did with Gendry or hear about all the kinky things the wild girl wanted to do with her brother. Now Arya wished that she had let the redhead scar for her life.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to kill her.&rdquo;</p><p>It was a well-known fact that Drunk Ygritte had no filter and her favorite topic of conversation was sex. Which was also right when she was sober, but it was amplified by alcohol.</p><p>&ldquo;I believe she mentioned something about abs of steel?&rdquo;</p><p>Arya&rsquo;s cheeks were now flaming hotter than Ygritte&rsquo;s hair and libido. Gendry felt a rush of pride at the fact that he had made the bold and unflappable Arya Stark blush. It was nice to have the upper hand for once and not be the one flailing. And besides, the brunette looked absolutely adorable with her red cheeks and wide eyes.</p><p>Arya had had him wrapped around her little finger for years without even realizing it, which always seemed to end up with him in embarrassing situations that ranged from her wrestling him to the ground to borrowing his shirt to sleep in, and having very few boundaries.</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As milady-&rdquo;</p><p>She&rsquo;s kissing him before he had a chance to finish the sentence.</p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F15186926&amp;t=NjNlMzYxOGFkNTRiMjdkMzY5NzBiNTNmZmQ3NjAyNzM1ZjRkM2IwNixjYzQ4MWE5NThlZGM0MzcwMGYwNDFiNzkxOGQ4MWUwMWQ4YTRkYTU1\">AO3</a></p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanfiction.net%2Fs%2F12992360%2F1%2FThe-Corruption-of-Rickon-Stark-And-Other-Happenings&amp;t=YTNkZjQ3YjcyNDhlMWIzNmQ0MmNkYWIxMDUzODhjZjRjMzE0YmZlMCwzOWVkZmQ5MzcxZTFlMmRmMzY1N2U3ZmU2ZDcxZGFjNzA3YTI5ZTdl\">fanfiction.net</a></p></p>",

        "body": "<p>Bran sits beneath the Heart Tree, the snow falling around him. For the first time in a long time, feels something. He feels a need to comfort Jon to say something, anything, to make this okay. But he can&rsquo;t.</p>\n\n<p>\n  <em>I had to. Jon\u00a0had to know. I didn&rsquo;t have a choice.</em>\n</p>\n\n<p>Bran help can&rsquo;t but feel as though it&rsquo;s his fault, even though he knows it&rsquo;s not.</p>\n\n<p>The worry that clouds Sansa&rsquo;s pristine blue eyes. The anger radiating off of Arya. The pain and devastation stitched across Jon&rsquo;s face.</p>\n\n<p>Sansa sits there, her back perfectly straight, her beautiful features twisted in shock, her mind working overtime to process this, what it means. How it will affect the North, their family. Strategizing. Working through all the ways this could help them. Or if it will destroy them. As if there weren&rsquo;t enough factors to deal with.</p>\n\n<p>Arya is angry.</p>\n\n<p>She has always been angry. Angry at the world for dictating her fate, for not giving her a choice, for telling her that who she is was wrong. Angry at her enemies for all they had done to her family, the North, and those who couldn&rsquo;t fight for themselves. Angry at the world, for all it had taken from her. Angry at herself for not being able to save those she loves, for knowing that no matter how many names she crosses off her list, it will never be enough, because she can&rsquo;t bring them back.</p>\n\n<p>But now, she was angry\u00a0for\u00a0Jon.</p>\n\n<p>He doesn&rsquo;t deserve this. Jon is the best person\u00a0Arya knows. She loves more him than anyone, she always has and she always will. All her childhood she watched him suffer the fate of being a bastard. Suffer for something that he couldn&rsquo;t control. Suffer for a lie. So she gets angry, because that all she knows.</p>\n\n<p>Jon can&rsquo;t breathe He can&rsquo;t even think. It&rsquo;s too much. So he runs. He doesn&rsquo;t know where he is going but he doesn&rsquo;t really care.</p>\n\n<p>Jon finds himself sitting on top of the tower that had once been a guard post but had been abandoned for decades. He used to come when he wanted to think. It&rsquo;s quiet and he can see the whole of Winterfell from here.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s a lie. Everything he thought he knew nothing more than a lie. Ned Stark is not his father.\u00a0<em>He&rsquo;s my uncle\u00a0</em>Jon thinks bitterly\u00a0<em>like Benjen</em>. Jon wonders if Benjen had known. If the man he had grown up idolizing had lied to him too.</p>\n\n<p>Arya, Robb, Sansa, Bran, and Rickon had never been his siblings.</p>\n\n<p><em>Cousins</em>.</p>\n\n<p>All his life\u00a0Jon endured it, the curse of being a bastard. The contempt from Lady Stark, the mocking from Theon, the whispers behind his back. He always pretended that it never bothered him but it did.</p>\n\n<p>Lord Snow, that&rsquo;s what Allister Thorne had dubbed him. Always a Snow never a Stark. All his life he wanted to be a Stark, to be trueborn. But the world is cruelly ironic. He\u00a0<em>is</em>\u00a0trueborn, but a Targaryen instead.</p>\n\n<p>\n  <em>Ned Stark&rsquo;s bastard.</em>\n</p>\n\n<p>That what&rsquo;s Jon had always been first and foremost. It had been his label, his claim to an identity and he had worn it like armor.</p>\n\n<p>He had never wanted to be King in the North, and yet all along he has been the rightful heir to Iron Throne, and not a bastard at all.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The whole thing is bitterly ironic. A cruel joke the world sees fit to torment him with.</p>\n\n<p>Everything\u00a0Jon was raised to believe is a lie. And that hurts him more than anything.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I thought I might find you up here.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The grey-eyed girl takes a seat next to him, her feet dangling over the edge.</p>\n\n<p>Arya knows him better than anyone, even now, after all these years and all they&rsquo;d been through, she still does.</p>\n\n<p>\n  <em>Two halves of one whole.</em>\n</p>\n\n<p>The only ones with Stark look.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\n  <em>What do you know of my heart, priestess? What do you know of my sister?</em>\n</p>\n\n<p>Jon could pretend for everyone, but not her, not his little wolf.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You know nothing, Jon Snow.&rdquo; He laughs bitterly, the last words of the girl he had loved ringing in his ears.</p>\n\n<p>Arya looks over at him. &ldquo;Ygritte.&rdquo; For once, her voice is soft when it&rsquo;s always been steel.</p>\n\n<p>\n  <em>She&rsquo;s afraid of cutting me.</em>\n</p>\n\n<p>Jon nods. &ldquo;She was always right, in the end.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a bitter tinge to his words.</p>\n\n<p>He doesn&rsquo;t like to talk about the girl he had loved and lost, it hurts too much, even now. But he told Arya. They told each other everything, all they had done. All their sins,\u00a0all the failures, and losses, no matter how terrible, how painful.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I was scared, y'know. More than when I thought I would bleed out\u00a0in the Braavosi alley. More than when they would pick who torture at Harrenhall. More than that day in front of the Sept. I was terrified that when I told you all I had done, the people I killed, the sins I committed, that you would hate me. I could lose everything, but not you. I don&rsquo;t think I would have survived that. But you loved me all the same. You told me we all have blood on our hands. But then I told you that I didn&rsquo;t have blood on my hands, that it covered me, a stained me and I could never wash it away. I wasn&rsquo;t your little wolf anymore. That that girl had died when they took Ned Stark&rsquo;s head. Do you remember what you told me then?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Jon swallows. &ldquo;That it didn&rsquo;t matter. That it has always been you and me and it will always be you and me. That nothing can ever change that.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>They had always understood each other in a way no one else could. Two misfits who had never truly belonged. The brooding bastard and the little lady who was anything but.</p>\n\n<p>She nods. &ldquo;You were right. You still are.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Arya takes his face in her hands. They&rsquo;re small and cold and littered with scars, just like her. &ldquo;This doesn&rsquo;t change anything. Not for me. Brother or cousin, you&rsquo;re still my blood. Snow, Stark, Targaryen. Jon or Aegon. None of that matters. I don&rsquo;t give a damn what your name is, or who fathered you. Ned Stark will always be your father, more than some dead prince ever will be. He raised you to be the man I see before me, and I love that man, more than\u00a0anything else in this whole world. I always have. You are still the boy who gave me Needle. Who loved and accepted me for who I was and never tried to change me. Even our father could never do that. You are my pack, always and forever.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>He looks into her stormy eyes, that ones that haunted his dreams, the ones that reminded him of home.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Always and forever.&rdquo; He whispers back.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/14593173\">AO3</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12936366/1/Always-and-Forever\">fanfiction.net</a></p>",

I didn\u2019t have a choice.</em>\n</p>\n\n<p>Bran help can\u2019t but feel as though it\u2019s his fault, even though he knows it\u2019s not.</p>\n\n<p>The worry that clouds Sansa\u2019s pristine blue eyes. The anger radiating off of Arya. The pain and devastation stitched across Jon\u2019s face.</p>\n\n<p>Sansa sits there, her back perfectly straight, her beautiful features twisted in shock, her mind working overtime to process this, what it means. How it will affect the North, their family. Strategizing. Working through all the ways this could help them. Or if it will destroy them. As if there weren\u2019t enough factors to deal with.</p>\n\n<p>Arya is angry.</p>\n\n<p>She has always been angry. Angry at the world for dictating her fate, for not giving her a choice, for telling her that who she is was wrong. Angry at her enemies for all they had done to her family, the North, and those who couldn\u2019t fight for themselves. Angry at the world, for all it had taken from her. Angry at herself for not being able to save those she loves, for knowing that no matter how many names she crosses off her list, it will never be enough, because she can\u2019t bring them back.</p>\n\n<p>But now, she was angry\u00a0for\u00a0Jon.</p>\n\n<p>He doesn\u2019t deserve this. Jon is the best person\u00a0Arya knows. She loves more him than anyone, she always has and she always will. All her childhood she watched him suffer the fate of being a bastard. Suffer for something that he couldn\u2019t control. Suffer for a lie. So she gets angry, because that all she knows.</p>\n\n<p>Jon can\u2019t breathe He can\u2019t even think. It\u2019s too much. So he runs. He doesn\u2019t know where he is going but he doesn\u2019t really care.</p>\n\n<p>Jon finds himself sitting on top of the tower that had once been a guard post but had been abandoned for decades. He used to come when he wanted to think. It\u2019s quiet and he can see the whole of Winterfell from here.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s a lie. Everything he thought he knew nothing more than a lie. Ned Stark is not his father.\u00a0<em>He\u2019s my uncle\u00a0</em>Jon thinks bitterly\u00a0<em>like Benjen</em>. Jon wonders if Benjen had known. If the man he had grown up idolizing had lied to him too.</p>\n\n<p>Arya, Robb, Sansa, Bran, and Rickon had never been his siblings.</p>\n\n<p><em>Cousins</em>.</p>\n\n<p>All his life\u00a0Jon endured it, the curse of being a bastard. The contempt from Lady Stark, the mocking from Theon, the whispers behind his back. He always pretended that it never bothered him but it did.</p>\n\n<p>Lord Snow, that\u2019s what Allister Thorne had dubbed him. Always a Snow never a Stark. All his life he wanted to be a Stark, to be trueborn. But the world is cruelly ironic. He\u00a0<em>is</em>\u00a0trueborn, but a Targaryen instead.</p>\n\n<p>\n  <em>Ned Stark\u2019s bastard.</em>\n</p>\n\n<p>That what\u2019s Jon had always been first and foremost. It had been his label, his claim to an identity and he had worn it like armor.</p>\n\n<p>He had never wanted to be King in the North, and yet all along he has been the rightful heir to Iron Throne, and not a bastard at all.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The whole thing is bitterly ironic. A cruel joke the world sees fit to torment him with.</p>\n\n<p>Everything\u00a0Jon was raised to believe is a lie. And that hurts him more than anything.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI thought I might find you up here.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The grey-eyed girl takes a seat next to him, her feet dangling over the edge.</p>\n\n<p>Arya knows him better than anyone, even now, after all these years and all they\u2019d been through, she still does.</p>\n\n<p>\n  <em>Two halves of one whole.</em>\n</p>\n\n<p>The only ones with Stark look.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\n  <em>What do you know of my heart, priestess?

More than when I thought I would bleed out\u00a0in the Braavosi alley. More than when they would pick who torture at Harrenhall. More than that day in front of the Sept. I was terrified that when I told you all I had done, the people I killed, the sins I committed, that you would hate me. I could lose everything, but not you. I don\u2019t think I would have survived that. But you loved me all the same. You told me we all have blood on our hands. But then I told you that I didn\u2019t have blood on my hands, that it covered me, a stained me and I could never wash it away. I wasn\u2019t your little wolf anymore.

Brother or cousin, you\u2019re still my blood. Snow, Stark, Targaryen. Jon or Aegon. None of that matters. I don\u2019t give a damn what your name is, or who fathered you. Ned Stark will always be your father, more than some dead prince ever will be. He raised you to be the man I see before me, and I love that man, more than\u00a0anything else in this whole world. I always have. You are still the boy who gave me Needle. Who loved and accepted me for who I was and never tried to change me. Even our father could never do that.

She used to throw snowballs at them and help them steal pies from the kitchen. Their wives gave her scones and she invented names for their babies and played monsters-and-maidens and hide-the-treasure and come-into-my-castle with their children. Fat Tom used to call her &ldquo;Arya Underfoot,&rdquo; because he said that was where she always was.
