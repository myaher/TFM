closest to &lsquo;normal&rsquo; on the team, they&rsquo;re both leaders, without both of them, the avengers aren&rsquo;t the avengers.\u00a0</p><p>in <i>the avengers</i>, they make judgements on each other, tony from what he&rsquo;s been told growing up completely contradicting what steve rogers turn out to be and steve, presumably, was only shown his file, which we know said &rsquo;<i>textbook narcissism</i>&rsquo; and then prove each other wrong throughout the film.</p><p>tony calls steve\u00a0\u2018<i>not of use</i>\u2019 and then relies on him in the battle at the end to take charge. we can also infer that tony\u2019s completely disappointed that his hero\u2019s not all that he\u2019s cracked up to be in that first helicarrier scene, but in that final scene with loki, he tells him that he\u2019s a\u00a0\u2018<i>living legend that kind of lives up to the legend\u2019</i> - <b>tony lost and then regained respect for him, for him, the legends were right</b>.</p><p>steve tells tony that he\u00a0\u2018<i>only fights for himself</i>\u2019, as a result of the file he\u2019s seen on him. tony flies a nuke into a wormhole to save new york, near enough exactly what steve did at the end of <i>the first avenger</i>. through this, <b>steve also gains respect for tony, he sees that he was wrong</b>.\u00a0</p><p>we end with them shaking hands and going their separate ways - maybe not quite friends yet, but on the path, and they respect each other. they won</p><p>in the opening of <i>age of ultron</i>, we see them fighting together, this is probably their\u00a0\u2018peak\u2019 if it were, they\u2019re fighting as a team, seamlessly, there\u2019s more than respect now, there\u2019s <b>trust, </b>you watch that scene back again, you can tell, they\u2019re close enough that they can joke while they\u2019re fighting steve isn\u2019t afraid to call tony out (<i>language</i>) and he just makes light of it, when in <i>the avengers,</i>\u00a0he likely would\u2019ve insulted him.</p><p>there\u2019s a scene with them partying, comfortable around one another, they all try to pick up mjolnir, essentially another dick-measuring contest but it\u2019s light-hearted fun, they&rsquo;re friends</p><p>tony, a guy, who\u2019s established as a little of a control-freak   gives up power to steve, whilst also establishing that <b>both</b>\u00a0of them are leaders, in the interaction between hill and tony (h: <i>boss?</i>\u00a0t: <i>nah, [steve]\u2019s the boss, i just pay for everything and make everyone look cool</i>), this shows trust and that they\u2019re an

                "content": "<p><h2>steve and tony, why their mutual respect is essential to the avengers.</h2><p>the thing about the avengers, is that steve and tony truly are the core. they&rsquo;re both the closest to &lsquo;normal&rsquo; on the team, they&rsquo;re both leaders, without both of them, the avengers aren&rsquo;t the avengers.&nbsp;</p><p>in <i>the avengers</i>, they make judgements on each other, tony from what he&rsquo;s been told growing up completely contradicting what steve rogers turn out to be and steve, presumably, was only shown his file, which we know said &rsquo;<i>textbook narcissism</i>&rsquo; and then prove each other wrong throughout the film.</p><p>tony calls steve&nbsp;&lsquo;<i>not of use</i>&rsquo; and then relies on him in the battle at the end to take charge. we can also infer that tony&rsquo;s completely disappointed that his hero&rsquo;s not all that he&rsquo;s cracked up to be in that first helicarrier scene, but in that final scene with loki, he tells him that he&rsquo;s a&nbsp;&lsquo;<i>living legend that kind of lives up to the legend&rsquo;</i> - <b>tony lost and then regained respect for him, for him, the legends were right</b>.</p><p>steve tells tony that he&nbsp;&lsquo;<i>only fights for himself</i>&rsquo;, as a result of the file he&rsquo;s seen on him. tony flies a nuke into a wormhole to save new york, near enough exactly what steve did at the end of <i>the first avenger</i>. through this, <b>steve also gains respect for tony, he sees that he was wrong</b>.&nbsp;</p><p>we end with them shaking hands and going their separate ways - maybe not quite friends yet, but on the path, and they respect each other. they won</p><p>in the opening of <i>age of ultron</i>, we see them fighting together, this is probably their&nbsp;&lsquo;peak&rsquo; if it were, they&rsquo;re fighting as a team, seamlessly, there&rsquo;s more than respect now, there&rsquo;s <b>trust, </b>you watch that scene back again, you can tell, they&rsquo;re close enough that they can joke while they&rsquo;re fighting steve isn&rsquo;t afraid to call tony out (<i>language</i>) and he just makes light of it, when in <i>the avengers,</i>&nbsp;he likely would&rsquo;ve insulted him.</p><p>there&rsquo;s a scene with them partying, comfortable around one another, they all try to pick up mjolnir, essentially another dick-measuring contest but it&rsquo;s light-hearted fun, they&rsquo;re friends</p><p>tony, a guy, who&rsquo;s established as a little of a control-freak   gives up power to steve, whilst also establishing that <b>both</b>&nbsp;of them are leaders, in the interaction between hill and tony (h: <i>boss?</i>&nbsp;t: <i>nah, [steve]&rsquo;s the boss, i just pay for everything and make everyone look cool</i>), this shows trust and that they&rsquo;re an established team, but also small insecurities as steve looks surprised that tony&rsquo;d said that.</p><p><i>age of ultron</i>&nbsp;is also where we see more cracks forming in their relationship, they&rsquo;re keeping secrets from one another, tony with ultron and steve with his parents&rsquo; death (dealt with in <i>civil war</i>)</p><p>that wood chopping scene details it. steve&rsquo;s just come back from tearing down hydra and shield, ultron, from his perspective, would have sounded a lot like project insight - something he was vehemently against, something almost lost his life, and sam and nat&rsquo;s, destroying.&nbsp;</p><p>in this, they&rsquo;re showing more than just a&nbsp;&lsquo;who&rsquo;s better&rsquo; type of argument like the helicarrier one from <i>the avengers</i>, they&rsquo;re showing their opposing ideologies in protecting their world, in how they do their jobs, based on their previous experience.</p><p>tony&rsquo;s trying to win a war before it starts, so to speak, because he used to be a war profiteer, to him, if he hadn&rsquo;t sold those weapons in the first place, there would have bee less damage, he saw what effect his weapons were having, and to some extent, he believes that those lives lost were his fault, <i><b>my</b>&nbsp;weapons</i>.</p><p>steve knows that every time<i>&nbsp;someone tries to win a war before it starts, people get hurt</i>, maybe because he thinks that war is inevitable, regardless of what people do beforehand that may win it, because people get hurt from that. he saw that with erskine, right after he got the serum, to him, war stays on the battlefield, extending it past that, with espionage, is how people get hurt.</p><p>it&rsquo;s also a callback to project insight, innocent people were targetted, he doesn&rsquo;t want that to happen again.</p><p>whilst they both have different ways on how they should do it, their main missions are to <b>protect the innocent</b>&nbsp;and <b>avenge those they couldn&rsquo;t</b>, tony pretty much says it in <i>the avengers</i>.</p><p>we end this one with them friendly,

What the hell are you doing&rdquo; Tony exclaims with wide eyes. &ldquo;Nothing&rdquo; she quickly removes her costume and is back in her own clothes. &ldquo;You you just transformed&rdquo; he points at her. &ldquo;What are you talking about Tony?&rdquo; </p><p>One of the only plus sides of her old life is that she knows how to lie. She has done it a lot in Asgard. &ldquo;You were wearing like an armor and doing weird magic stuff&rdquo; he points at her. &ldquo;Tony calm down, I think you&rsquo;ve had some weird hallucination it can happen when you sleep little. Just go to bed and it&rsquo;ll be okay&rdquo; y/n knows it&rsquo;s bad to lie, but she knows that he will declare her for crazy if she says the truth.</p><p>&ldquo;oh okay sure&rdquo; Tony slowly lies down in y/n\u2019s bed. &ldquo;Get some sleep&rdquo; she strokes his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Come come&rdquo; Tony shuffles over to the side of the bed. &ldquo;Tony I can&rsquo;t&rdquo; y/n shakes her head lightly. &ldquo;whyy&rdquo; he whines in his sleepy state. &ldquo;I- I can&rsquo;t Tony&rdquo; y/n tries to walk away bit Tony grabs her wrist. &ldquo;Please just come&rdquo; the goddess hears the pleads and she wonders why he would sleep around if it made him so lonely.</p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;Only because it&rsquo;s you&rdquo; y/n gives in with a small smile and lies down next to the billionaire. &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; Tony mumbles as he snuggles in his assistant. </p><p>The second time in two days that they sleep together. They both know that that&rsquo;s not something a boss and his employee does but they don&rsquo;t care as it was most comfortable in each others arms.</p><p>The night ended soon and they act like nothing happend. Like they didn&rsquo;t just slept two nights in each others arms. </p><p>&ldquo;Tony where are you? It&rsquo;s about to start&rdquo; y/n leaves an angry message in his voicemail. </p><p>&ldquo; Visionary. Genius. American patriot.&rdquo; the presentation starts. &ldquo;Even from an early age, the son of legendary weapons developer Howard Stark quickly stole the spotlight with his brilliant and unique mind. At age four, he built his first circuit board. At age six, his first engine. And at seventeen, he graduated Summa Cum Laude from MIT.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then, the passing of a titan. Howard Stark&rsquo;s life long friend and ally Obadiah Stane, steps in to help fill the gap left by the legendary founder. Untill at age 21, the prodigal son returns, and is anointed the new CEO of Stark Industries&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With the keys to the kingdom, Tony ushers in a new era for his father&rsquo;s legacy, creating smarter weapons, advanced robotics&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As liaison to Stark Industries, I&rsquo;ve had the unique privilege of serving with a real patriot. He is my friend and he is my great mentor. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to present this year&rsquo;s Apogee Award to Mr. Tony Stark!&rdquo; Rhodey says taking over from the pre-programmed show. </p><p>&ldquo;Tony?&rdquo; Rhodey look through the room, his gaze falls on the goddess and y/n slightly shakes her head. Everyone starts mumbling things about Tony. Y/n looks at Obadiah signaling him to go on the stage.</p><p>He gets the idea and awkwardly stumbles on the stage. &ldquo;Thank you&hellip;I, uhhh, I&rsquo;m not Tony Stark, but if I were Tony, I&rsquo;d tell you how honored I am and&hellip;what a joy it is to receive this award. The best thing about Tony is also the worst thing &ndash; he&rsquo;s always working&rdquo; Obadiah says rounds of his speech and walks down the stairs. He angrily shoves the award in y/n&rsquo;s hands and says &ldquo;Get this to Tony and talk to him about this&rdquo;</p><p>She rolls her eyes and walks towards the one place Tony Stark would be, the casino.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon\u201d Tony mutters before he throws the dice on the table. \u201cTony\u201d y/n says to get his attention. \u201cAh there is my lucky charm\u201d Tony pulls her closer but she worms out of his grip. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he tilts his head slightly. </p><p>\u201cThey said if I would presented you with an award you would be deeply honored\u201d Rhodey says. \u201cOf course I\u2019d be deeply honored\u201d Tony defends him. \u201cSo when do we do it?\u201d he asks them. \u201cIt\u2019s over already\u201d y/n rolls her eyes. Tony continues to roll the dice and he even asks for y/n and Rhodey to blow in his hand for luck, they both decline. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark excuse me, Christine Everheart\u201d a girl introduces herself. \u2018One of those one night stands\u2019 y/n thinks to herself. \u201cCan I ask you a couple of questions?\u201d she asks, but Tony is to busy talking to Happy about how cute she is. \u201cYeah okay go\u201d Tony turns back to the girl. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been called the DaVinci of out time.

It&rsquo;s about to start&rdquo; y/n leaves an angry message in his voicemail. </p><p>&ldquo; Visionary. Genius.

At age four, he built his first circuit board. At age six, his first engine. And at seventeen, he graduated Summa Cum Laude from MIT.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then, the passing of a titan.

Everyone starts mumbling things about Tony. Y/n looks at Obadiah signaling him to go on the stage.</p><p>He gets the idea and awkwardly stumbles on the stage. &ldquo;Thank you&hellip;I, uhhh, I&rsquo;m not Tony Stark, but if I were Tony, I&rsquo;d tell you how honored I am and&hellip;what a joy it is to receive this award. The best thing about Tony is also the worst thing &ndash; he&rsquo;s always working&rdquo; Obadiah says rounds of his speech and walks down the stairs.
