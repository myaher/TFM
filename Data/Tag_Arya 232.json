        "question": "Re Sansa ships, I shipped Jonsa before S6 due to stuff in the books but never thought it would happen, I thought Sansa/Edric could happen. Since Sansa&Jon reunited on the show I'm convinced Jonsa will happen in some form, I still expect Jon to die though. Sandry is a long shot but you never know because I think there will need to be new alliances between the kingdoms & marriage is the obvious way to do that. With few main characters likely to survive what marriages do you think could happen?",
        "answer": "<p>the problem with sansa/edric endgame is that house dayne is a minor house. unless sansa met him and fell in love very quickly in the books, i don\u2019t see her marrying him esp when her marriage could bring kingdoms together since she has ties to 3 kingdoms. it\u2019s still possible, after all he is strong, brave and gentle.\u00a0</p><p>book and show jonsa metas have swayed me a lot. it went from a crackship to something that could possibly be endgame. after all why mention sansa in the same breath as jon and dany? sansa can\u2019t be the only person who disagrees with jon\u2019s choice to bend the knee.</p><p>it\u2019s hard because the show\u2019s scope is pretty small. they don\u2019t care about so many important houses. i doubt tristane will die in the books. if he had lived in the show, i would have said sansa x tristane is a possibility. tyrion\u2019s dead. jon\u2019s survival is dubious. euron is gone definitely and so are cersei and jaime. that leaves theon, one of the northern lords and one of the vale lords. all three are disqualified because theon has been castrated (the show treats it like a joke, like he\u2019s less of a man. i doubt they\u2019ll pair him with one of the main women). the only prominent vale lord is lord royce who is married. the northern lords we see are married too. that leaves a maybe alive jon.</p><p>as for arya, maybe gendry. then again d&amp;d made the weird choice to have him not mention her once with jon. i mean sandor did. who knows? bran might marry meera or (weird i know) lyanna mormont or they\u2019ll write him as the three eyed raven till the end because disabled people don\u2019t deserve happy endings. if missandei survives, i think greyworm will die.</p><p>that\u2019s it for the characters i know for sure are surviving. the rest are minor characters who don\u2019t have romantic scenes.</p>",
