So then R just decides she wants to meet Tony & does, problem is that she has MAJOR ISSUES. Didn't grow up in a happy close family, doesnt know how to communicate with others due to being pulled out of school and homeschooled from age 12-13.",
        "answer": "<blockquote><p>2) She doesnt know how to ask for stuff cuz growing up she never got things by asking so she got them herself so she doesnt know to accept peoples help &amp; stuff. She forgets to eat for days, she forgets to sleep. She suffers from anxiety and all that. Like due to homeschooling there are no records of her from age 12 only records of a few doctors appointments. She has MAJOR abandonment issues due to Tony not being there while she was growing up.<br/></p><p>3) Due to Tony having Morgan (And still the working with the avengers with Pep as the CEO) she doesn\u2019t know how to act or think. She has a at home job, she goes out occasionally to walk the streets of the city and she\u2019ll go to a lab somewhere there (Again she doesn\u2019t ask Tony FOR ANYTHING, she just wants to see what type of person he is) and works on her projects. She also doesn\u2019t show many emotions cuz they never got her anything so she just doesn\u2019t show them.<br/></p><p>4) The avengers and other mcu characters are in there. They\u2019re so interested in this girl the practical opposite of Tony that seems so lonely and has so many walls. I imagine itd be completely platonic fic with everyone. Through the fic they manage to draw her out of her shell &amp; somewhere in the fic she bursts out in tears with Tony and screams \u201cWhy weren\u2019t you there? Why did i have to grow up without a dad, while others had so amazing relationships with theirs?\u201d<br/></p><p>5) and just leaves the Tower/Compound the next day without anyone knowing. (She thinks the entire thing was useless and pointless so she leaves) When Peper manages to track her down they find out that R is a chairman of her own strings of businesses but she doesnt like spotlight so she has a person thats in the spotlight for her (a best friend thats been with her throughout her not so happy childhood) and they explain her thought process to them and that she doesny know how to communicate.</p><p>6) She\u2019s also a very self dependent person. She doesn\u2019t drink cuz it makes her vulnerable, she learnt multiple fighting styles to protect herself in any situation, she learnt to shoot guns for if she ever needed one, she started working at age 16 to get money to provide for herself, she doesn\u2019t know how to trust others except for her best friend and thats the only close person she has in her life so theres a tun of obstacles that they all work through.</p><p>7) &amp; what would make it even better is that shes an omega class mutant so it would explain her not so loving childhood &amp; having to learn to provide for herself.

Her mother is laughing at a grown-up joke that doesn&rsquo;t make sense and her father is politely arguing with another man across the room. She&rsquo;s supposed to stay with her parents and smile and shake hands when she&rsquo;s introduced to people, but that&rsquo;s boring. So instead, she sneaks off.</p><p>There is one other kid her age present at the gala.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; she says.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Hope.&rdquo;</p><p>He grins.&nbsp;&ldquo;I know, Hope Van Dyne. I&rsquo;m Tony Stark. Do you wanna be friends just to make our dads mad?&rdquo;</p><p>Hope is only seven and loves both of her parents a lot. She doesn&rsquo;t quite understand this tall eleven year old, but she does kind of get the desire to be someone other than just Hank Pym&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp;&ldquo;Only use my first name and you have a deal,&rdquo; she says, holding out her hand to shake. Tony gives her a fist bump instead.</p><p>&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>Hope isn&rsquo;t supposed to be listening in on her father&rsquo;s business meeting. Tony isn&rsquo;t supposed to be there at all. But Tony&rsquo;s butler had taken a sick day and Hope&rsquo;s mother had died and suddenly both of them were left with only fathers who cared too much about business and too little about children. So, both of them press glasses to the wall and listen.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Hank, just sell to me. It&rsquo;ll be easier on everyone. You&rsquo;re clearly losing it and your stocks are plummeting. Admit it, Pym Tech is halfway in the ground at this point, which is more than can be said for your wife-&rdquo;</i><br /></p><p>Hope pulls away from the door, gasping indignantly. Hank&rsquo;s roar of anger is clearly audible. She turns to Tony and fold her arms over her chest.&nbsp;&ldquo;I think I hate your dad.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony only nods slowly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, me too.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>Hope glances up from her documents when she hears a familiar name from the television. She expects another sex scandal or science award, but the banner on the screen jolts her. <b>TONY STARK TAKEN HOSTAGE</b>, it reads.</p><p>She bites her lip and turns back to her papers, making a note to reach out to Stark Industries about rescue attempts.</p><p>Hope sits on a couch in the Stark family&rsquo;s cabin, silent and solemn. She&rsquo;s deep in thought, which cassie, beside her, clearly picks up on.&nbsp;&ldquo;What are you thinking about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I miss Tony,&rdquo; Hope admits.&nbsp;&ldquo;We were friends, when we were younger. We wrote letters a lot when we were your age. We grew apart when I started working for Pym Tech, just because of business reasons. I kind of wish we hadn&rsquo;t&hellip; he was a good man.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Cassie wraps her arms around her.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you lost your friend.

        "body": "<p><b>Pairing: Mob Boss Tony x Peter Parker<br/>Word Count: 1219<br/></b><b><i>Warnings: </i>Drug use, slight foul language, mentions of violence</b></p><p>There wasn&rsquo;t anything that got past Tony. He was a silent, but thorough observer which was necessary for his line of work. Of course, a large part of his work required traveling despite his precious baby boy&rsquo;s desperate pleas to remain stationary. The boy was undeniably his daddy&rsquo;s boy and honestly there really wasn&rsquo;t anything Tony cared for or about unless it pertained to that precious boy, his money, or his pleasure. He wasn&rsquo;t afraid to voice it either.</p><p>Tony had left for an entire month in order to ensure an extremely important deal was properly executed. It should have been simple, an assload of his drugs in exchange for an assload of their weapons. There was no real reason he should have attended. His mean should have been more than capable of ensuring this deal went smoothly, but he hadn&rsquo;t wanted to chance it. So, he left his precious boy, Peter for four weeks. And that&rsquo;s when it first happened.</p><p>Miraculously, some of his merchandise had disappeared. He chalked it up to some idiotic underling who was unsure of Tony&rsquo;s authority. Thus, he took care of the situation in a way that definitively proved who was in charge: he put a bullet right between a guards eyes, and thought the situation was dealt with in its entirety.</p><p>Sadly, he was <i>sorely </i>mistaken.</p><p>Peter Parker was Tony&rsquo;s perfect princess. There wasn&rsquo;t anything that sweet Pete wouldn&rsquo;t do for his daddy and there wasn&rsquo;t much that Tony wouldn&rsquo;t do in return. But Tony had rules. And Peter knew far better than to question them, or break them. Tony had told him, at the very very beginning that there wasn&rsquo;t much he needed to know except these three things: They were exclusive, Peter wasn&rsquo;t to leave the compound, and Peter was under no circumstances to take any of the merchandise within the compound. Tony, and his company, Stark Industries were a notorious underground hub for quality paraphernalia, and Tony prided himself in selling the best drugs in the entirety of the country. But he refused to taint his baby boy with any of that, and didn&rsquo;t really use it for recreational purposes much either.</p><p>So when the kilo of cocaine seemingly disintegrated and there were absolutely no traces of its new whereabouts, Tony hadn&rsquo;t even thought to look in his precious boy&rsquo;s direction.</p><p>But perhaps he should have.</p><p>Peter couldn&rsquo;t help that hollow, uncontrollable lonely that settled in the pit of his stomach and ostensibly ate its way into his bones, until there was nothing. Every time Tony left on one of those stupid deals there was nothing to complete him, nothing to make him feel whole. In the midst of Tony&rsquo;s one-month deal, Peter began weighing his options.</p><p>He attended school, took a few AP classes in Bio and Psych and he knew the dangers and the effects. He knew what drugs could do to him, the extreme hazards they posed and yet somehow in the face of this persistent, inexterminable loneliness, he chose to concede. </p><p>And that first time, he could feel <i>everything</i>. He tied up his curls in a bun, leaned towards the white powered line on the table, gently held his left nostril closed and used the small receipt he had rolled to inhale those fine grains. Within 10 minutes he could feel his brain running through all the anatomical and physiological processes that were happening within him. The cocaine seeping through his intranasal walls into his bloodstream. From the bloodstream to his brain. Within his brain the dopamine being produced would begin to accumulate as a result of the cocaine hindering the dopamine&rsquo;s transportation out of the synapse, and would henceforth create the high of a lifetime. That first time was all he needed, and he knew he wouldn&rsquo;t just be able to stop. Tony was gone, and for the first time, when he was gone, Peter hadn&rsquo;t felt so utterly hollow. He by no means felt complete, but at least he was distracted.</p><p>Each day Peter upped his dosage. Not by much, but enough to make a large dent in the block of coke he had hidden under his bed. Rather, their bed. His and Tony&rsquo;s. When sober, the guilt ate at him, but when he was gone, there wasn&rsquo;t anything wrong with what he did. When he was sober he noticed the tremors and recognized that his hollowness seemed exponentially worse, hoping Tony would be oblivious to these changes we he returned. When he was on another planet he hadn&rsquo;t cared about his obvious trembling, or the insomnia accompanied with being completely wired.</p><p>When Tony arrived home from that month long trip and glocked that guard, precious princess Pete hadn&rsquo;t felt a goddamn thing, because he was higher than hell. Tony had many matters to attend to that day, so Peter made himself busy laying in their bed, eyes rolling into the back of his head, pale skin flushing with patches of pink as the room seemed to get hotter, as his heart started to beat faster. In his trance, Peter began to contemplate the small proximity between his lover physically, but what ate away at him was the seemingly large distance between them. That Tony, <i>his </i>Tony, <i>his</i> daddy, didn&rsquo;t seem to care if he was there or not. Peter hadn&rsquo;t known that Tony was itching to see him, and was planning to put all of duties aside in order to spend the rest of day with him. </p><p>So Pete procured another line for himself, essentially doubling the dosage he typically took.
