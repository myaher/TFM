                "content": "<p>Phil Lester- He reveals your surprise party</p><p>You were lay in bed with your boyfriend Phil Lester with a laptop balancing on your knees as you watched some YouTube with him before bed. In two days time it was your birthday and each and every year you begged your friends and family to not make a big fuss out of it. If anything you wanted to see your family in the day and then have your two best friends over to the flat to watch a film and cuddle with Phil your boyfriend but each year they tried to surprise you with something.</p><p>So far this year everything had been kept very quiet, they seemed to agree with your wishes of a quite night in which you knew was not like them at all and you didn&rsquo;t buy it yet you had no way to prove that they were up to sometimes. Phil was the weak spot of the group, he was just too open and honest to hide things for very long so for the past 4 days you had been grilling him for answers and so far he had not said a word and it was making you impatient.</p><p>You knew something was going on because Phil was more secretive around his phone but you would never invade his privacy by going through it no matter how much you wanted too. Turning to him in bed he looks down at you with a small smile on his face while glancing up every now and again to look at the laptop screen that was showing Shane Dawson&rsquo;s new video.</p><p>&ldquo;What is happening on Saturday?&rdquo; you ask like you already had so many times before, in response Phil just sighs while looking at you with raised eyebrows, silently asking why you were bothering</p><p>&ldquo;Phil you know how much I don&rsquo;t like surprises and you know how much I like to have quiet birthdays, I know you&rsquo;re up to something so why don&rsquo;t you just tell me?&rdquo; you ask trying to be angry but his sweet personality and cute face could never make you angry for long which was another that you loved about him but partially hated because sometimes you wanted to be angry but you couldn&rsquo;t. Not with him, even when it did concern your looming birthday.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, We&rsquo;ve already told you. We are staying in and having a movie night like you request every year&rdquo; Phil sighs but he has the smallest smile on his face that tells you he is lying</p><p>&ldquo;And every year you ignore my request so what&rsquo;s different about this year?&rdquo; You ask, Phil can&rsquo;t even come up with a response so he just shrugs.
