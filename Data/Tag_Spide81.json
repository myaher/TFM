Whether or not it was a success was another story, but you\u2019d like to think even the failed ones were successful. If you were trying to bake a cake and it didn\u2019t work out, it became a pudding instead. I mean, it still tasted great so hardly a failure in your eyes. Baking with Peter however was another story. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you up to now, hmm?\u201d Peter walked into the kitchen in nothing but his grey sweatpants, looking questionably at what you were doing. Questionably because you were trying to figure out your own measurements without weighing scales, and in doing so had created a mess all over the kitchen counter and over yourself. Huffing, you crossed your arms and pouted towards Peter. </p><p>\u201cWhat kind of madman doesn\u2019t own weighing scales or even measuring cups?!\u201d You exclaimed, furrowing your brows in frustration as Peter merely walked towards you and gave a small chuckle. \u201cWell, Y/N, usually the kind of \u2018madman\u2019 that lives solely off of takeout pizza\u201d Peter says, giving you a lopsided grin whilst nodding towards the empty pizza boxes that had piled up near the bin. Sighing, you simply walked into him, smothering the side of your face against his chest as you whined in a strange attempt to make yourself feel better. Wrapping his arms around you, he said \u201chey, it\u2019s okay. We\u2019ll figure it out together. What do we need to measure and how much of it?\u201d Looking up at him with a pout, you told him the exact measurements of everything that you needed, and together you both tried your best to eye the measurements. Like you said before, a failed cake will become pudding instead. </p><p>When it came to measuring the flour, you knew you had to be cautious here, <i>especially</i> around Peter B. Parker. Peter mixed with flour was a recipe for disaster. That man had played too many tricks on you for you to trust him around the damn flour, but apparently you couldn\u2019t act quick enough in preventing the problematic situation of a mushroom cloud of flour filling the kitchen. \u201cPeter don\u2019t you dare - PETER BENJAMIN PARKER IF YOU\u2014\u201d before you could even finish your sentence, Peter grabbed the pack of flour, sticking his hand inside and throwing it at you. The flour covered the whole of your face and almost all of your torso, making you look as if you walked through a snow storm. Peter doubled over in laughter, wheezing hard from how funny he found it. But you knew better. You wanted to make sure that messing with Y/F/N Y/L/N was a declaration of war itself, and you weren\u2019t going down without a fight. Seeing his fit of laughter as a window of opportunity, you quickly grabbed the pack of flour and moved it behind you, slowly making your way towards Peter. \u201cPeter, that\u2019s not fu\u2014\u201d you were off by an abrupt sneeze leaving you from the obvious flour entering your nose. Peter stood upright as he wiped his eyes from the tears that had started to form from his laughter, looking you in the eyes with his own big, chocolate ones. </p><p>\u201cY/N, you never learn. How many times has this happened before? Like, 5? I don\u2019t know, I lost count\u201d Peter smirked at you, using his obvious towering height as an advantage and as a means of intimidating you. Bringing one hand up to his neck in order to bring him closer so you could whisper into his ear, you said \u201coh Peter, when will you ever learn that anything you can do, <i>I</i>  can do <i>better\u201d </i>using this moment to your advantage, you quickly moved back and grabbed the flour, launching the whole thing at Peter\u2019s \u2018oh shit\u2019 face. Now it was your turn to double over in laughter and be on the brink of tears while Peter coughed up clouds of flour, shaking his head in an attempt to get the flour out of his hair and face. Coming down from the high of laughter, you held on to the side of the counter to support your body. \u201cYou are evil, Y/N, pure <i>evil\u201d </i>Peter<i> </i>pouted towards you as he crossed his arms and hunched his shoulders. You wiped his face with your hands, staring into his eyes once more and feeling the love radiating off of him. Now, standing there covered in flour, in an attempt to lighten him up, you pressed a small kiss to the corner of his lips, and then kissed him all over his face. You could see how hard he was trying to keep the pout up, but the quivering of his lips and eyebrows gave him up.</p><p>Stepping back, you both looked around at the surrounding area, finding everything covered top to bottom by flour, \u201clook at what a mess we\u2019ve made\u201d. Looking at you with one brow raised, he said \u201ca mess \u2018<i>we\u2019ve made</i>\u2019? Excuse you, this-\u201c Peter pointed all around him as he continued, \u201c-was <i>all you</i>\u201d. Scoffing, you fired back, \u201cnone of this would\u2019ve happened if you didn\u2019t throw flour at me so now you face the consequences of messing with the mighty Y/N\u201d.  </p><p>\u201cNow you can\u2019t bake whatever it is you were going to bake and whatever I was going to eat\u201d Peter retaliated. You, being two steps ahead of the game, walked towards one of the kitchen cupboards and pulled out a new pack of flour. The plan was to make brownies and nothing was going to get in your way of that, not even a flour storm. \u201cHuh, I should\u2019ve guessed that you of all people would be prepared for this. What\u2019re you planning on baking anyway?\u201d You made sure Peter kept his distance during the second flour process and replied \u201cbrownies, not just any brownies, <i>my</i> brownies\u201d winking towards Peter as you finished the sentence. If heart eyes were real, you were sure that Peter\u2019s eyes would have them right now. \u201cNow, if you\u2019re up for it, how about we try and make these together, hmm?\u201d </p><p>Peter immediately stood by your side as you began the process of making your infamous brownies. You let Peter use the electric whisk to combine all the sugar and eggs and butter, and made sure you kept him away from any of the dry ingredients, particularly the flour and more importantly, the cocoa powder. Together, you two were a pretty good team, minus the flour fight. \u201cYou\u2019re doing such a great job, Pete. At this rate, we could open our own bakery\u201d you joked as Peter shot you a look of disbelief. \u201cOh my god, Y/N. Now you\u2019re just purposely bringing back flashbacks of my failed TGI Spideys\u201d.</p><p>Chuckling, you folded in the dry ingredients along with the chocolate pieces and popped the mixture into a pan and then into the oven. \u201cCan I lick the bowl Y/N? Pretty please?\u201d Peter shot you his puppy eyes and who could say no to those gorgeous eyes? \u201cOf course. You helped in making the mixture so it\u2019s only fair, Pete. But can I have the spoon?\u201d. Peter nodded quickly and watching his eyes light up, Peter quickly delved into the remnants of the brownie mixture left in the bowl whilst you got to lick the spoon. </p><p>\u201cHave I told you how much I love you, Y/N? Because I really, <i>reeeeeaaaaally</i> love you\u201d Peter looked at you with his charming smile, brownie mixture tainting the side of his mouth. Reaching out, you wiped the side of his mouth to rid him of the chocolate and gave him a kiss. A kiss that spoke a thousand words. He knew that you loved him, that you <i>love</i> him even now. Parting your lips from his, you gazed into his eyes and held him close. You love this man, more than words could describe. You wished you could give him all the stars in the sky because he deserved nothing less. This tired man brought nothing but life to you and he filled you with love every single day. </p><p>\u201cI love you, Peter B. Parker\u201d</p>",

Seeing his fit of laughter as a window of opportunity, you quickly grabbed the pack of flour and moved it behind you, slowly making your way towards Peter. \u201cPeter, that\u2019s not fu\u2014\u201d you were off by an abrupt sneeze leaving you from the obvious flour entering your nose. Peter stood upright as he wiped his eyes from the tears that had started to form from his laughter, looking you in the eyes with his own big, chocolate ones. </p><p>\u201cY/N, you never learn. How many times has this happened before? Like, 5? I don\u2019t know, I lost count\u201d Peter smirked at you, using his obvious towering height as an advantage and as a means of intimidating you. Bringing one hand up to his neck in order to bring him closer so you could whisper into his ear, you said \u201coh Peter, when will you ever learn that anything you can do, <i>I</i>  can do <i>better\u201d </i>using this moment to your advantage, you quickly moved back and grabbed the flour, launching the whole thing at Peter\u2019s \u2018oh shit\u2019 face. Now it was your turn to double over in laughter and be on the brink of tears while Peter coughed up clouds of flour, shaking his head in an attempt to get the flour out of his hair and face. Coming down from the high of laughter, you held on to the side of the counter to support your body. \u201cYou are evil, Y/N, pure <i>evil\u201d </i>Peter<i> </i>pouted towards you as he crossed his arms and hunched his shoulders. You wiped his face with your hands, staring into his eyes once more and feeling the love radiating off of him. Now, standing there covered in flour, in an attempt to lighten him up, you pressed a small kiss to the corner of his lips, and then kissed him all over his face. You could see how hard he was trying to keep the pout up, but the quivering of his lips and eyebrows gave him up.</p><p>Stepping back, you both looked around at the surrounding area, finding everything covered top to bottom by flour, \u201clook at what a mess we\u2019ve made\u201d. Looking at you with one brow raised, he said \u201ca mess \u2018<i>we\u2019ve made</i>\u2019? Excuse you, this-\u201c Peter pointed all around him as he continued, \u201c-was <i>all you</i>\u201d. Scoffing, you fired back, \u201cnone of this would\u2019ve happened if you didn\u2019t throw flour at me so now you face the consequences of messing with the mighty Y/N\u201d.  </p><p>\u201cNow you can\u2019t bake whatever it is you were going to bake and whatever I was going to eat\u201d Peter retaliated. You, being two steps ahead of the game, walked towards one of the kitchen cupboards and pulled out a new pack of flour. The plan was to make brownies and nothing was going to get in your way of that, not even a flour storm. \u201cHuh, I should\u2019ve guessed that you of all people would be prepared for this. What\u2019re you planning on baking anyway?\u201d You made sure Peter kept his distance during the second flour process and replied \u201cbrownies, not just any brownies, <i>my</i> brownies\u201d winking towards Peter as you finished the sentence. If heart eyes were real, you were sure that Peter\u2019s eyes would have them right now. \u201cNow, if you\u2019re up for it, how about we try and make these together, hmm?\u201d </p><p>Peter immediately stood by your side as you began the process of making your infamous brownies. You let Peter use the electric whisk to combine all the sugar and eggs and butter, and made sure you kept him away from any of the dry ingredients, particularly the flour and more importantly, the cocoa powder. Together, you two were a pretty good team, minus the flour fight. \u201cYou\u2019re doing such a great job, Pete. At this rate, we could open our own bakery\u201d you joked as Peter shot you a look of disbelief. \u201cOh my god, Y/N. Now you\u2019re just purposely bringing back flashbacks of my failed TGI Spideys\u201d.</p><p>Chuckling, you folded in the dry ingredients along with the chocolate pieces and popped the mixture into a pan and then into the oven. \u201cCan I lick the bowl Y/N? Pretty please?\u201d Peter shot you his puppy eyes and who could say no to those gorgeous eyes? \u201cOf course. You helped in making the mixture so it\u2019s only fair, Pete. But can I have the spoon?\u201d. Peter nodded quickly and watching his eyes light up, Peter quickly delved into the remnants of the brownie mixture left in the bowl whilst you got to lick the spoon. </p><p>\u201cHave I told you how much I love you, Y/N? Because I really, <i>reeeeeaaaaally</i> love you\u201d Peter looked at you with his charming smile, brownie mixture tainting the side of his mouth. Reaching out, you wiped the side of his mouth to rid him of the chocolate and gave him a kiss. A kiss that spoke a thousand words. He knew that you loved him, that you <i>love</i> him even now. Parting your lips from his, you gazed into his eyes and held him close. You love this man, more than words could describe. You wished you could give him all the stars in the sky because he deserved nothing less. This tired man brought nothing but life to you and he filled you with love every single day. </p><p>\u201cI love you, Peter B. Parker\u201d</p></p>",

Whether or not it was a success was another story, but you\u2019d like to think even the failed ones were successful. If you were trying to bake a cake and it didn\u2019t work out, it became a pudding instead. I mean, it still tasted great so hardly a failure in your eyes. Baking with Peter however was another story. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you up to now, hmm?\u201d Peter walked into the kitchen in nothing but his grey sweatpants, looking questionably at what you were doing. Questionably because you were trying to figure out your own measurements without weighing scales, and in doing so had created a mess all over the kitchen counter and over yourself. Huffing, you crossed your arms and pouted towards Peter. </p><p>\u201cWhat kind of madman doesn\u2019t own weighing scales or even measuring cups?!\u201d You exclaimed, furrowing your brows in frustration as Peter merely walked towards you and gave a small chuckle. \u201cWell, Y/N, usually the kind of \u2018madman\u2019 that lives solely off of takeout pizza\u201d Peter says, giving you a lopsided grin whilst nodding towards the empty pizza boxes that had piled up near the bin. Sighing, you simply walked into him, smothering the side of your face against his chest as you whined in a strange attempt to make yourself feel better. Wrapping his arms around you, he said \u201chey, it\u2019s okay. We\u2019ll figure it out together. What do we need to measure and how much of it?\u201d Looking up at him with a pout, you told him the exact measurements of everything that you needed, and together you both tried your best to eye the measurements. Like you said before, a failed cake will become pudding instead. </p><p>When it came to measuring the flour, you knew you had to be cautious here, <i>especially</i> around Peter B. Parker. Peter mixed with flour was a recipe for disaster. That man had played too many tricks on you for you to trust him around the damn flour, but apparently you couldn\u2019t act quick enough in preventing the problematic situation of a mushroom cloud of flour filling the kitchen. \u201cPeter don\u2019t you dare - PETER BENJAMIN PARKER IF YOU\u2014\u201d before you could even finish your sentence, Peter grabbed the pack of flour, sticking his hand inside and throwing it at you.
