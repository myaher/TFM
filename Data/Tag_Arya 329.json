It brought them both to an early grave.&rdquo; Arya heard sadness in his voice; he did not often speak of his father, or of the brother and sister who had died before she was born. &ldquo;Lyanna might have carried a sword, if my lord father had allowed it. <b>You remind me of her sometimes. You even look like her.</b></i>&quot;\u00a0- Arya II, AGoT<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Both horses were lathered and flagging by the time he came up beside her, reached over, and grabbed her bridle.

Arya! Bran thought eagerly, as he watched her leap up onto a rock and cut at the boy</b>. But that couldn&rsquo;t be right. If the girl was Arya, the boy was Bran himself, and he had never worn his hair so long. And <b>Arya</b> <b>never beat me playing swords, the way that girl is beating him</b>. She slashed the <b>boy</b> across his thigh, so hard that his leg went out from under him and he fell into the pool and began to splash and shout.</i>\u201d - Bran III, ADwD<br/></p><p><i><b>Lady Bulwer</b></i></p><p>\u201c<i>Lady Leonette gave her lessons on the high harp, and Lady Janna shared all the choice gossip.

Brown hair, brown eyes, skinny &hellip; could it be? Arya Stark&rsquo;s hair was brown, she recalled, but Brienne was not sure of the color of her eyes.
