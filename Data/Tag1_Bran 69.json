        "question": "Things that relieved me during episode 1: Sansa\u2019s apology to Tyrion being borderline sarcastic and not about her self deprecating Bran emoting when he reunited with Jon Theon being badass and then going north, meaning he\u2019s reuniting with Sansa  Sansa Snark first of her name  Jon at least visibly not being comfortable on the dragon  Tyrion getting called out on all his shit, from the eunuch jokes to trusting Cersei  The fact that Jon not only said but emphasized to Dany how pretty his sister is",
        "answer": "<p>I don\u2019t think her apology was sarcastic, I think she was sincere, but at the same time, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing. Look, if Sansa had apologized to Tyrion for being a\u00a0\u2018\u2019bad child bride\u2019\u2019, I would\u2019ve have thrown hands, however, she apologized for making an extremely reasonable decision that just happened to endanger him, and she, being the good and empathetic person that she is, felt bad about it. I did like her criticizing Tyrion for his blind faith in Cersei as well. That was really sastifying to watch.\u00a0 Bran definitely developed a wider array of emotions. It\u2019s not radically different, but it\u2019s a positive change. Theon absolutely killed it this episode, and seeing him wanting to help fight for the Starks, who are his family, after all that happened, makes me so proud and emotional. It\u2019s no surprise that Jon isn\u2019t quite comfortable on the decision, it\u2019s his first time. That being said, unlike Theon, Jon only grew and lived with the Starks. His identity revolves around the North and the Starks, and so when faced with a choice, he\u2019s going to choose the only side that ever really mattered to him. There\u2019s also Arya, who really surprised me this episode. Not in terms of siding with Sansa, but in terms of feeling so human this episode. She wasn\u2019t just the emotionless killing machine the show pushed her to be last season. Seeing her smile, laugh, make jokes and flirt in this episode really great to see. Made me remember why I liked her so much in the first six seasons when I first watched the show. So yeah, the Starks are doing all right. Love that for them.\u00a0</p>",
