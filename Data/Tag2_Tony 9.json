As you finish clearing the last remaining people out of the area\nand shooting down a few Chitauri you start to feel dizzy and you know that your\nblood sugar is getting low and you need to do something about it.

With you\nbeing the youngest of the Avengers, and the fact you\u2019re diabetic, these two\nfactors lead to the other Avengers being immensely overprotective over you,\neach other them viewing you as their own child. They had noticed that you were\nslightly anxious as you sorted out your weapons and Clint had noticed your\nhands shaking as you loaded your gun but brushed it off as you just being\nnervous about the upcoming battle.

As you finish clearing the last remaining people out of the area\nand shooting down a few Chitauri you start to feel dizzy and you know that your\nblood sugar is getting low and you need to do something about it. You stumble\ninto an abandoned building, leaning on the wall for support as you fumble in\nyour suit, hoping to find a packet of gummy bears or some kind of sweet to\nbring your blood sugar levels up enough to finish the fight. You start to feel\nanxiety build in your stomach as you can\u2019t find anything, you forgot to pack a\nsnack in your suit, you were so worried about this battle you forgot one of the\nmost important things for you. You start to feel your energy draining and you\ndrag yourself behind a counter to hide yourself from any Chitauri that may\ninvestigate the area before allowing your tired eyes to slowly close.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cJARVIS, do you know where the kid is? I haven\u2019t seen her at\nall during this fight.\u201d Tony says to his AI, growing worried as he\u2019s seen every\nmember of the team besides you, allowing him to jump to conclusions and assume\nthe worst already. </p><p>\u201cSir, it appears that Miss y/n has fallen unconscious.\u201d That\nsentence alone basically gave Tony heart palpitations.</p><p>\u201cJARVIS, where the fuck is she? I need her location. Now.\u201d\nTony demands, trying to keep his breathing under control and listen to where\nJARVIS tells him to go. When he finds your location, he enters the building and\nfinds you slumped against the counter. He wastes no time scooping you up in his\narms and moving you to some place safe, opting to not take you to the tower in\ncase of it being attacked and instead taking you to a hospital. Once Loki had\nbeen defeated, the rest of the Avengers start to notice you\u2019re missing and\nstart to ask where you are. Natasha catches on to the fact that Tony isn\u2019t as\nconcerned as everyone else, meaning he must know where you are.</p><p>\u201cStark, where\u2019s y/n?\u201d Steve says, walking up to Tony, trying\nto keep his emotions in check and not show the fear he has in you potentially\nbeing hurt, or worse. </p><p>\u201cCome with me.\u201d Tony says simply, taking them to the\nhospital and walking up to the receptionist with the five other Avengers stood\nright behind him.</p><p>\u201cI need to see y/n l/n please.\u201d He says to the woman who\nbarely glances up at him before typing in your name onto her computer to find\nout your room number.</p><p>\u201cRoom 242, 3<sup>rd</sup> floor, are you family?\u201d She responds\nin a monotonous tone which makes Tony roll his eyes slightly and sigh under his\nbreath.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re her family.\u201d He responds before he and the rest\nof the team get into a lift and once they arrive on the third floor, start to\nsearch for your room. Clint is the one to find your room and waves his hand wildly\nto get their attention, so he doesn\u2019t shout and disturb any other patients\nnearby. He opens the door and walks in slowly, jumping slightly when he sees a\nnurse in there with you. She notices the presence of the Avengers and looks up\nand smiles at them all.</p><p>\u201cAre you her family?\u201d She asks, barely batting an eyelid at all\nof them, bar Tony and Bruce, still being in their superhero suits.

They didn\u2019t have\nto wait around long though as after about an hour of them sitting around they\nsaw you move and slowly open your eyes, adjusting to the bright light of the\nhospital.</p><p>\u201cHey guys.\u201d You mumble, smiling at them slightly as they all\nsmile back at you.</p><p>\u201cHey kid, you feeling ok?\u201d Clint says, quickly shifting into\nfather mode.

All of them fall silent\nfor a split second before Bruce speaks up.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell someone you forgot snacks? We could\u2019ve found\na way to get something over to you quickly.\u201d He says lightly, shuffling his\nchair slightly closer to address you properly.</p><p>\u201cI knew you guys were too busy saving the world to worry\nabout me so I just fought until I couldn\u2019t anymore.\u201d You say, avoiding eye\ncontact with any of the team who all glance at each other with worry filled\neyes, hating the fact you thought you weren\u2019t important to them.</p><p>\u201cy/n, you are so vital to the team, you helped the remaining\ncivilians escape that we hadn\u2019t noticed were still in the city. We all love and\ncare about you so much, we can\u2019t imagine what we\u2019d do if something happened to\nyou.\u201d Nat says softly, making you look up at her and look around at the team\nwho have looks of genuine care and worry in their eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe all worry about you, with the fact you\u2019re a member of\nthe Avengers and your diabetes, we care a lot about you and don\u2019t want anything\nto happen to you.

They then all\ndecide to have a group hug and trap you in the middle which you laugh about but\nenjoyed all the same. You loved this team with your entire heart. Yes, they\ncould be overprotective and overbearing sometimes but you knew they truly care\nfor you and that\u2019s all that mattered to you.
