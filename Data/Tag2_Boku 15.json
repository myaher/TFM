He never saw a sign of discomfort and leaned in fully to kiss you flush on the lips. You closed your eyes into the kiss and brought your hand up to meet his on your face.</p><p>He was gentle, passionate, full of love. He kept his eyes on your features and body to see if there was any kind of uneasiness. He kept his hands where he was familiar with and never farther. He kept his morals clean and crisp.</p><p>Then he did something you were not expecting and moved your head to the side to kiss along your neck. He liked at your flesh and lightly nipped in places, but never hard enough to leave marks. You, in surprise, brought your hand up to his shoulder which caused him to freeze and pull back slowly.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that too much,&rdquo; He would ask you kindly in his smooth voice causing you to swallow hard.</p><p>&ldquo;No, continue&hellip; please.&rdquo; You tried to mimic his politeness and he gave a little smile before moving his hands to your hips.</p><p>&ldquo;May I move you someplace more comfortable?&rdquo; You looked at him quizzically before nodding slowly. He stood up and pulled you up by the hand before grabbing below your butt and hoisting you up onto his waist, in which you wrapped your legs tightly around him. </p><p>You were brought to his room, which you were familiar with from so many dates and almosts. He kissed you deeply and moved you towards the bed. His hands were holding you tight and his stomach muscles flexed with slight strain but he seemed unworried.</p><p>His hetero chromatic eyes stared into your own for a moment before he leaned down and laid you down onto the silky bedspread. You kept your hands on his shoulders as he loomed over you until he pulled back and pulled off his shirt.</p><p>He moved to the hem of your shirt but he hesitated and looked down before biting his lip in a look you had not seen on him many times, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know if you will like me.
