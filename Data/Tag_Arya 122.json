The tweet read like this:<br/><i>Bold prediction that I will at some point write a tumblr meta about. Bran gets the NK, Arya kills Daenerys, Sansa takes out Tyrion, and Jon valonqars the sh*t out of Cersei. Just like that all their enemies are gone. #Starks4theWin #Starklings</i><br/></p><p><b>Bran v\u2019s Night King</b></p><p>This is the point I am the least sure about. But in the end, I do think Bran will play a pivotal role in taking out the Night King and the White Walkers. Jon will come in with the huge assist along with Arya. I fully expect them to have some big kills.</p><p><b>Arya v\u2019s Daenerys</b></p><p>A few other people in the fandom have mentioned this or talked about it. Arya has long been about killing Cersei, the Queen.

And Daenerys would have no interest in annulling a marriage between Tyrion and Sansa. What would better tie the North and the Westerlands to her cause then maintaining this marriage. See when Jon gave up his crown (sorta&hellip;he never actually got down on his knee\u2026) he gave up his authority in the North outside of commanding the armies. Sansa has the real power in Winterfell, now. The check on that. The check on Northern independence is Tyrion re-asserting their marriage. So yea Sansa really has to get out of it.

The basic argument goes a bit like this, the use of the term hints at someone with valyrian ancestry.

This makes it an ideal term to refer to Jon after the parent reveal because he is the younger of Rhaegar\u2019s children. He is the younger Aegon. The added bonus is he is the younger King in the North, too. This makes more sense in the books where (f)Aegon, Rhaegar\u2019s older son and the older Aegon because Jon will be named Aegon in the books, plays a big role.
