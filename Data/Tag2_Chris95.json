Well, it wont be. </b></p><p>Thursday morning rolled around far faster than I thought it would, before I knew it Chris was calling me telling me he was outside and waiting for me. I had packed and repacked my bag a dozen times in the last three days and the mess in my bedroom and in the living room was evidence to that fact, but my case was finally packed and I was as ready as I was ever going to be.<b><br/></b></p><p>I heaved the case down the stairs of my building and out onto the street, </p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Chris called as he appeared by my side and took the case from my hands, he lifted it easily into the back of his car. Dodger\u2019s head popped up from the back seats to look into the trunk of the car as my case was push in next to Chris\u2019.</p><p>\u201cHey bud,\u201d I greeted and he made a low, quiet noise in way of response and disappeared back behind the seat. </p><p>\u201cYou ready for this?\u201d he asked me as he closed the door of the trunk, he watched my face closely. </p><!-- more --><p>\u201cIn the same way anyone can be ready for something their not ready for,\u201d I replied shrugging. He gently placed his hand on my arm. </p><p>\u201cWhatever happens, I\u2019m here okay?\u201d he said, his large hand warm on my arm. </p><p>I nodded and swallowed hard, took a deep and steadying breath before heading for the passenger seat door. I slid into the oversize leather seat and clipped in my seat-belt, Chris slid in beside me and started the engine. </p><p>\u201cIs what I\u2019m wearing okay to meet your parents,\u201d he asked, looking down at himself. He had on a pair of pale blue jeans and a dark blue t-shirt, his cap was on backwards today and there was a pair of sunglasses on perched on the top of his head. </p><p>\u201cYou look great,\u201d I replied, he did, but then again he looked great in whatever he had on. </p><p>\u201cWhat tux did you choose?\u201d I asked as we pulled away from the curb and headed down the street. </p><p>\u201cBlack velvet, I know its your favourite,\u201d he replied, glancing at me and winking, I laughed but he was absolutely right and I was thrilled by bis choice. </p><p>\u201cWe are going to be the best dressed couple there,\u201d I said with a grin on my face, \u201coh and just wait until I tell you about what my sister text me the other day,\u201d </p><p>I proceeded to explain to Chris that my entire family thought he was my boyfriend which made him crease up with laughter and helped ease a little of the anxiety that had build up in my stomach. </p><p>\u201cDad will give you a total grilling when we get there,\u201d I said, as he cruised along the freeway, \u201che\u2019ll want to know if you can fish and track and chop your own firewood, he\u2019s a real mans man,\u201d I added.</p><p>\u201cOh lordy,\u201d Chris said with a laugh, \u201cwe should turn around now because I am going to be such a disappointment to him,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me both then,\u201d I replied, laughing as well, but I quickly got lost in my own thoughts again.</p><p>\u201cPenny for them?\u201d Chris asked after a few minutes of silence. </p><p>\u201cOh just thinking about the last time I saw my parents,\u201d I replied, glancing over my shoulder at the back seat where Dodger was resting his head in his paws. </p><p>\u201cWanna tell me about it? Because, you know, we\u2019ve never talked about what happened with them,\u201d he asked glancing over at me. </p><p>\u201cDo you remember that girl I was seeing for a while, two years ago?\u201d I started, my hands wringing together in my lap. </p><p>\u201cYeah I remember her, she moved back west didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, feeling a burning sensation climbing up my throat, I had never talk about this, not with anyone. </p><p>\u201cWell, my parents dropped in on us unexpectedly and well, they weren\u2019t overjoyed with the idea of me being in a same sex couple,\u201d I paused for a second and swallowed hard, \u201cI guess I had never come out to them and it would have never had crossed their mind that their daughter would have been anything but straight,\u201d Chris nodded encouragingly but didn\u2019t speak, giving me the space to continue. </p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019re Catholics and I think the way they reacted was shock more than true malice but- it doesn\u2019t change the fact they did hurt me, but I think they didn\u2019t know how to handle it and neither did I and we just made a total mess it of,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you made a mess of things,\u201d Chris said after a few moments of silence, \u201cyou were being honest about who you are,\u201d I considered his words for a moment. </p><p>\u201cBut my hand had been forced,\u201d I said, \u201cMaybe what hurt them most was that I had never been honest with them before that moment when the truth was out their already,\u201d </p><p>He shrugged, \u201cMaybe,\u201d he mused, \u201cbut still, they shouldn\u2019t have been cruel to you,\u201d </p><p>\u201cLike I said, I think it was shock, but no, they shouldn\u2019t have,\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s what this all comes down to huh? Because they don\u2019t like that you&rsquo;re bi?\u201d </p><p>It was my turn to shrug now, \u201cI guess so, seems stupid when you say it like that,\u201d </p><p>Chris reached out and put his hand over mine and squeezed gently, his hands were warm and soft and felt comforting on my skin. </p><p>\u201cIf they can\u2019t get over that and love you for who you are then they don\u2019t deserve you,\u201d he said quietly, lifting one of my hands from my lap and bring it to his lips, he kissed the back of my hand gently before letting it go so he could use the turn signal. </p><p>My skin flush red hot where his lips had touched it and there was a quivering feeling in my belly. </p><p>We stopped about two hours into the journey to give Chris a break and give Dodger a chance to stretch his little legs. In the small convenience shop I stocked up on chocolate and sweets, knowing that I was unlikely to find any treats at my parents place. </p><p>Back in the car I pulled open a bag of MnM\u2019s and offered them to Chris, he took a handful and threw them in his mouth. </p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked again as he started the engine, I nodded and popped some more candies into my mouth. </p><p><br/></p><p><i>Much love!

He had on a pair of pale blue jeans and a dark blue t-shirt, his cap was on backwards today and there was a pair of sunglasses on perched on the top of his head. </p><p>\u201cYou look great,\u201d I replied, he did, but then again he looked great in whatever he had on. </p><p>\u201cWhat tux did you choose?\u201d I asked as we pulled away from the curb and headed down the street. </p><p>\u201cBlack velvet, I know its your favourite,\u201d he replied, glancing at me and winking, I laughed but he was absolutely right and I was thrilled by bis choice. </p><p>\u201cWe are going to be the best dressed couple there,\u201d I said with a grin on my face, \u201coh and just wait until I tell you about what my sister text me the other day,\u201d </p><p>I proceeded to explain to Chris that my entire family thought he was my boyfriend which made him crease up with laughter and helped ease a little of the anxiety that had build up in my stomach. </p><p>\u201cDad will give you a total grilling when we get there,\u201d I said, as he cruised along the freeway, \u201che\u2019ll want to know if you can fish and track and chop your own firewood, he\u2019s a real mans man,\u201d I added.</p><p>\u201cOh lordy,\u201d Chris said with a laugh, \u201cwe should turn around now because I am going to be such a disappointment to him,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me both then,\u201d I replied, laughing as well, but I quickly got lost in my own thoughts again.</p><p>\u201cPenny for them?\u201d Chris asked after a few minutes of silence. </p><p>\u201cOh just thinking about the last time I saw my parents,\u201d I replied, glancing over my shoulder at the back seat where Dodger was resting his head in his paws. </p><p>\u201cWanna tell me about it? Because, you know, we\u2019ve never talked about what happened with them,\u201d he asked glancing over at me. </p><p>\u201cDo you remember that girl I was seeing for a while, two years ago?\u201d I started, my hands wringing together in my lap. </p><p>\u201cYeah I remember her, she moved back west didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, feeling a burning sensation climbing up my throat, I had never talk about this, not with anyone. </p><p>\u201cWell, my parents dropped in on us unexpectedly and well, they weren\u2019t overjoyed with the idea of me being in a same sex couple,\u201d I paused for a second and swallowed hard, \u201cI guess I had never come out to them and it would have never had crossed their mind that their daughter would have been anything but straight,\u201d Chris nodded encouragingly but didn\u2019t speak, giving me the space to continue. </p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019re Catholics and I think the way they reacted was shock more than true malice but- it doesn\u2019t change the fact they did hurt me, but I think they didn\u2019t know how to handle it and neither did I and we just made a total mess it of,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you made a mess of things,\u201d Chris said after a few moments of silence, \u201cyou were being honest about who you are,\u201d I considered his words for a moment. </p><p>\u201cBut my hand had been forced,\u201d I said, \u201cMaybe what hurt them most was that I had never been honest with them before that moment when the truth was out their already,\u201d </p><p>He shrugged, \u201cMaybe,\u201d he mused, \u201cbut still, they shouldn\u2019t have been cruel to you,\u201d </p><p>\u201cLike I said, I think it was shock, but no, they shouldn\u2019t have,\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s what this all comes down to huh? Because they don\u2019t like that you\u2019re bi?\u201d </p><p>It was my turn to shrug now, \u201cI guess so, seems stupid when you say it like that,\u201d </p><p>Chris reached out and put his hand over mine and squeezed gently, his hands were warm and soft and felt comforting on my skin. </p><p>\u201cIf they can\u2019t get over that and love you for who you are then they don\u2019t deserve you,\u201d he said quietly, lifting one of my hands from my lap and bring it to his lips, he kissed the back of my hand gently before letting it go so he could use the turn signal. </p><p>My skin flush red hot where his lips had touched it and there was a quivering feeling in my belly. </p><p>We stopped about two hours into the journey to give Chris a break and give Dodger a chance to stretch his little legs. In the small convenience shop I stocked up on chocolate and sweets, knowing that I was unlikely to find any treats at my parents place. </p><p>Back in the car I pulled open a bag of MnM\u2019s and offered them to Chris, he took a handful and threw them in his mouth. </p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked again as he started the engine, I nodded and popped some more candies into my mouth. </p><p><br></p><p><i>Much love!
