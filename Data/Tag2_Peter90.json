        "body": "<p>Totally random one-off idea I\u2019ve had floating around for a few months, so bear with me, haha! Only planning for it to be a one-part, but please tell me what y\u2019all thing!\u00a0</p><p><b>For the Love of Queens<br/></b></p><p>Late August, 2018</p><p>After the snap, the last thing Peter wanted to do was to get himself in trouble again. He had had his fun already, been to more planets than 99.9998% of the population\u2014 if you rounded to the fourth decimal, he did the math\u2014 and had seen more tragedy than anyone should ever have to experience. But he wasn\u2019t willing to hang up the suit. He couldn\u2019t. His city still needed him, his people still needed him, and as much as he sometimes wanted to throw in the towel, he couldn\u2019t. He had an obligation to help wherever and whenever he could, and that commitment was one he didn\u2019t take lightly. If he wasn\u2019t going to protect Delmar\u2019s bodega, and that kid who had his bike stolen, and that nice Dominican lady who bought him a churro, who would? Spider-Man wasn\u2019t gone, but he needed to go back to his roots, back to where he came from. Back to being a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Back to Queens.</p><p>So, almost like someone had spun a Time-Turner back to 2017, Peter was sitting on the edge of a ten-story building a few blocks from his apartment, a #5 in one hand and his phone in the other. But the difference was, this time, he wasn\u2019t constantly texting Happy, itching for an assignment, for a chance to prove himself. He was scrolling through a Buzzfeed article entitled \u201c46 Memes Guaranteed to Butter Your Eggroll.\u201d He needed new material for the Midtown High Instagram page that he, Ned, and MJ ran. Now that his weekends weren\u2019t packed full of a potentially universe-ending sojourn to Titan, he had a little more spare time to actually, you know, be a kid for once. He bookmarked the page, finished off the churro, and zipped his phone into one of his suit pockets. Telling Tony he wanted to take a step back from the Avengers, having that conversation with him, was one of the hardest things Peter had ever had to do. There was nothing he hated more than disappointing people. Compounding that with the fact that Tony was probably the closest thing he had to a dad since Ben died, and Peter was practically shaking when he told him he wanted to ease up on missions. Tony was strangely understanding about the whole thing, even though Peter wasn\u2019t too sure why he expected otherwise, and pulled him into a hug, telling him to \u201cdo what you need to do, kid.\u201d And as soon as Petter reassured him that he did want to keep working with him, just maybe make the \u201cStark internship\u201d less Avenging and more STEM-y, he nodded, made a thirty-second phone call to Pepper, and told him to show up Monday after school.</p><!-- more --><p>So Peter wasn&rsquo;t less busy than normal, not by a long shot. Between school, homework, his actual internship, and the patrols\u2014 decathalon season hadn\u2019t started yet, thank God\u2014 his schedule was more packed than ever. But he was also happier than he\u2019d ever been, and more fulfilled than he could ever remember.</p><p>As Peter swung down from the ledge, dropping down to the street below, he noticed something odd. Not concerning, just out of the norm. Three people, young people, in T-shirts with clipboards, pens, and stacks of what was either flyers or restaurant menus, Peter couldn\u2019t really tell. They weren\u2019t with Greenpeace, or Amnesty, or the ASPCA, judging from the lack of logos on their clothing, so he was more than a little confused. Keeping a curious eye on them from his hiding place behind a lamppost, he waited a few minutes for the group to reach the next block. They had tucked some kind of a pamphlet-postcard-type-thing into the frame of Glen\u2019s Barber Shop, and after a moment to make sure the coast was clear, Peter looked for a moment, grabbed it, and slid it into a pocket.</p><hr><p>At about half past eleven, Peter was back on the fire escape outside of his Queens bedroom. After May had discovered his, er, \u201cextracurricular\u201d activities, she left his windows open at night, contingent on his promise that he\u2019d be back by midnight and kept his GPS location on in case anything went amiss. She knew that he was a good kid, that his heart was in the right place, and at his core, he just wanted to help people. And what kind of person would she be if she told Peter, who for all intents and purposes was her kid by this point, that he couldn\u2019t be a good person?</p><p>He threw his backpack on the floor, wincing when he heard the telltale \u201cclang\u201d of his water bottle, and unzipped his suit, folding it haphazardly and placing it back into its designated box. The pamphlet fluttered out of his pocket,and Peter leaned down to pick it up, one arm still wrestling to pull his favorite sleep shirt over his head. He originally tried to smooth out the creases, quickly abandoning his efforts, and sat on his bed. Peter knew that there was an election in a few months, he knew he absolutely detested Donald Trump, and he knew that he was mad as hell that he couldn\u2019t vote. But that had caused some amount of complacency with him; if he couldn\u2019t actually cast a ballot for anyone, what use was it knowing who was running or what was on the news if all it seemed was ever on was old people yelling at each other? It wasn\u2019t like Peter didn\u2019t care about the issues; that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. If he didn\u2019t end up going into crime-fighting full-time after high school, what he really wanted to do was go into environmental engineering and sustainable development. He\u2019d seen all of the heartache and pain that gun violence had brought the city and people he loved, so he knew how important reasonable gun control policy was. And despite all of New York City\u2019s espoused progressive values, Peter\u2019s AP Spanish teacher had come to school with red-rimmed eyes one day, telling the class that him and his husband had just been turned down by another adoption agency for being gay. And college. College was a big one. Tony had repeatedly offered to set him up at MIT\u2014 \u201cThink of it like a scholarship,\u201d he had said,\u2014 but Peter didn\u2019t want to feel like he was getting anything handed to him that he hadn\u2019t earned. May didn\u2019t make too much either, and while they could certainly live off of her salary from the hospital and Uncle Ben\u2019s life insurance for a while, hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loans were a different story.</p><p>Peter flipped the pamphlet around, scanning the front cover. Dignified healthcare. He liked that. Tuition-free higher education. He really liked that. Quality employment. A $15 minimum wage in New York City was great, but still didn\u2019t make ends meet for some people. Justice for all. Sounds about right, Peter thought. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat for Congress NY-14. He\u2019d have to look her up.</p><p>Half an hour later, Peter yawned as he finally closed his laptop from her campaign website, remarkably tired and also pretty sure he had signed up for a mailing list at some point. It was almost one, and he needed to get to bed. Research could wait until morning.</p><hr><p>\tIt was a block day, so after his calculus class had let out, Peter grabbed his lunch from the locker and walked over to the cafeteria, meeting Ned and MJ at their usual table.</p><p>\u201cSup,\u201d Ned said, in between waffle fries.</p><p>Peter looked at him quizcally. \u201cSince when do you say \u2018sup?\u2019\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s a new thing I\u2019m trying out. Doesn\u2019t work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot by a long shot.\u201d</p><p>MJ snorted. \u201cYou guys are a couple of losers, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not?\u201d Ned asked.</p><p>She tilted her head. \u201cThe thing is,\u201d she said, pausing, \u201cI already knew that, and I\u2019ve accepted it. It\u2019s only when you really come to terms with yourself and who you are that you\u2019re able to move on and develop. So what if I\u2019m a little bit of \u00a0loser?\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head, trying to hold back a snort. \u201cHey guys, want to hear something weird that happened to me yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always up for weird,\u201d Ned responded.</p><p>\u201cSo, I was on patrol, and these people were walking around. And at first I thought they were like from the ASPCA or something, you know how they\u2019re always around here?\u201d They nodded. \u201cBut anyways, they weren\u2019t, and I picked up one of the flyers they left by Glen\u2019s, the barber shop, and I got to reading, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, Peter joined a cult,\u201d Ned said, panicking.</p><p>Peter shook his head, reaching down into his backpack to retrieve the pamphlet. \u201cNo, no, I promise it\u2019s not a cult. I guess it was people campaigning for the election, what\u2019s it called, canvassing? Well, it\u2019s people canvassing for this woman running for Congress\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAOC?\u201d MJ asked, interrupting.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAOC. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. That who you\u2019re talking about?\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows furrowed. \u201cYeah, how did you know?\u201d</p><p>The side of her mouth twitched. \u201cI\u2019ve been walking for her since the summer. You know how I\u2019ve been busy on my weekends now?\u201d Peter and Ned nodded. \u201cI\u2019m heading up her youth volunteering. Outreach mostly, getting high schoolers to understand that they deserve to have a say in who\u2019s elected to represent us. Getting them to campaign for someone who actually believes that we all deserve a fair chance. To campaign for someone like them. A young person who\u2019s a woman of color, who didn\u2019t come from money, who cares.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeez, MJ, why don\u2019t you run yourself?\u201d Peter asked, only half-joking.</p><p>\u201cI mean,\u201d she started, grabbing the spare hairband from her wrist and pulling her hair into a ponytail, \u201cobviously I\u2019m too young, but I\u2019m not even sure if I\u2019d want to be the kind of public face that elected officials are. I\u2019d rather be the one calling the shots from behind the scenes, the guy in the chair, if you will,\u201d MJ added, nodding towards Ned.</p><p>\u201cWait, I\u2019m still confused. So who\u2019s she?\u201d Ned asked, looking in between Peter and MJ.</p><p>Peter slid the pamphlet over to his side of the table while MJ grinned. \u201cNow, let me tell you.\u201d</p><hr><p>Ten minutes and two online forms later, MJ had signed both Peter and Ned up for canvassing on Saturday. \u201cI know you\u2019ve got your \u2018Stark thing,\u2019\u201d she had said, using air quotes, \u201cand your actual Stark thing, so I put you down for the morning. You said you\u2019re free then, right?\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t have to be at Tony\u2019s until what, like 2 or something? Plenty of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, and Ned?\u201d</p><p>Ned tilted his head, in that low-key, laidback way of his. \u201cHey, you just tell me what you need and I\u2019m there, MJ. I trust your judgement. You say she\u2019s the real deal?\u201d</p><p>MJ nodded. \u201cShe is. I\u2019ve met her, and I like to pride myself on having what\u2019s probably the best bullshit detector of anyone I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>So Saturday afternoon found Ned, Peter, and MJ crammed into a small and packed but bright office in the north side of Queens, listening to someone who Peter\u2019s pretty sure introduced themself as AOC\u2019s campaign manager. Maybe deputy campaign manager? Peter wasn\u2019t too sure, he didn\u2019t know how these things usually went. But she was standing on a desk, which was cool.</p><p>\u201cYou need to make sure you\u2019re able to ask for their support, see who they\u2019re supporting, and tell them why you support Alexandria. This campaign is going to be won by people making connections and ensuring that everyone\u2019s voice is heard and everyone feels like they are listened to. Because she\u2019s running to represent the entire New York 14th, not only the ones who will vote for her. And I know it might seem tempting, but please, please make sure that you remain cordial to everyone, even if they say they\u2019re voting for the other guy or they think her policies are crap. Stay calm, thank them for their time, and move on. This campaign is already an uphill battle, and we don\u2019t need anything else stacked against us.\u201d She finished her speech with a slight nod of her head. \u201cCan I have all of our regular volunteers or field staff raise their hands?\u201d About fifteen people in the group of thirty-five or so raised their hands. \u201cAlright, anyone who\u2019s new or more comfortable with someone more experienced, grab a partner or two and get into groups of two or three. Javier over there,\u201d she pointed to a young man by the door, who was precariously holding stacks of folders in one hand, \u201chas the district maps and lists of all the houses everyone will be going to, so go see him for that. One per group.\u201d She was about to step down, but wheeled around and raised her voice again. \u201cOh, and one more thing\u2014\u201d she added, \u201cAlexandria will be stopping in the office around noonish after a town hall she\u2019s hosting, so be sure to swing back by if you haven\u2019t met her. Fair warning, she\u2019s a hugger.\u201d</p><p>MJ nudged Peter with her shoulder. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cOh, hell yeah I am.\u201d</p>",

Only planning for it to be a one-part, but please tell me what y\u2019all thing!\u00a0</p><p><b>For the Love of Queens<br></b></p><p>Late August, 2018</p><p>After the snap, the last thing Peter wanted to do was to get himself in trouble again. He had had his fun already, been to more planets than 99.9998% of the population\u2014 if you rounded to the fourth decimal, he did the math\u2014 and had seen more tragedy than anyone should ever have to experience. But he wasn\u2019t willing to hang up the suit. He couldn\u2019t. His city still needed him, his people still needed him, and as much as he sometimes wanted to throw in the towel, he couldn\u2019t. He had an obligation to help wherever and whenever he could, and that commitment was one he didn\u2019t take lightly. If he wasn\u2019t going to protect Delmar\u2019s bodega, and that kid who had his bike stolen, and that nice Dominican lady who bought him a churro, who would? Spider-Man wasn\u2019t gone, but he needed to go back to his roots, back to where he came from. Back to being a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Back to Queens.</p><p>So, almost like someone had spun a Time-Turner back to 2017, Peter was sitting on the edge of a ten-story building a few blocks from his apartment, a #5 in one hand and his phone in the other. But the difference was, this time, he wasn\u2019t constantly texting Happy, itching for an assignment, for a chance to prove himself. He was scrolling through a Buzzfeed article entitled \u201c46 Memes Guaranteed to Butter Your Eggroll.\u201d He needed new material for the Midtown High Instagram page that he, Ned, and MJ ran. Now that his weekends weren\u2019t packed full of a potentially universe-ending sojourn to Titan, he had a little more spare time to actually, you know, be a kid for once. He bookmarked the page, finished off the churro, and zipped his phone into one of his suit pockets. Telling Tony he wanted to take a step back from the Avengers, having that conversation with him, was one of the hardest things Peter had ever had to do. There was nothing he hated more than disappointing people. Compounding that with the fact that Tony was probably the closest thing he had to a dad since Ben died, and Peter was practically shaking when he told him he wanted to ease up on missions. Tony was strangely understanding about the whole thing, even though Peter wasn\u2019t too sure why he expected otherwise, and pulled him into a hug, telling him to \u201cdo what you need to do, kid.\u201d And as soon as Petter reassured him that he did want to keep working with him, just maybe make the \u201cStark internship\u201d less Avenging and more STEM-y, he nodded, made a thirty-second phone call to Pepper, and told him to show up Monday after school.</p>[[MORE]]<p>So Peter wasn\u2019t less busy than normal, not by a long shot. Between school, homework, his actual internship, and the patrols\u2014 decathalon season hadn\u2019t started yet, thank God\u2014 his schedule was more packed than ever. But he was also happier than he\u2019d ever been, and more fulfilled than he could ever remember.</p><p>As Peter swung down from the ledge, dropping down to the street below, he noticed something odd. Not concerning, just out of the norm. Three people, young people, in T-shirts with clipboards, pens, and stacks of what was either flyers or restaurant menus, Peter couldn\u2019t really tell. They weren\u2019t with Greenpeace, or Amnesty, or the ASPCA, judging from the lack of logos on their clothing, so he was more than a little confused. Keeping a curious eye on them from his hiding place behind a lamppost, he waited a few minutes for the group to reach the next block. They had tucked some kind of a pamphlet-postcard-type-thing into the frame of Glen\u2019s Barber Shop, and after a moment to make sure the coast was clear, Peter looked for a moment, grabbed it, and slid it into a pocket.</p><hr><p>At about half past eleven, Peter was back on the fire escape outside of his Queens bedroom. After May had discovered his, er, \u201cextracurricular\u201d activities, she left his windows open at night, contingent on his promise that he\u2019d be back by midnight and kept his GPS location on in case anything went amiss. She knew that he was a good kid, that his heart was in the right place, and at his core, he just wanted to help people. And what kind of person would she be if she told Peter, who for all intents and purposes was her kid by this point, that he couldn\u2019t be a good person?</p><p>He threw his backpack on the floor, wincing when he heard the telltale \u201cclang\u201d of his water bottle, and unzipped his suit, folding it haphazardly and placing it back into its designated box. The pamphlet fluttered out of his pocket,and Peter leaned down to pick it up, one arm still wrestling to pull his favorite sleep shirt over his head. He originally tried to smooth out the creases, quickly abandoning his efforts, and sat on his bed. Peter knew that there was an election in a few months, he knew he absolutely detested Donald Trump, and he knew that he was mad as hell that he couldn\u2019t vote. But that had caused some amount of complacency with him; if he couldn\u2019t actually cast a ballot for anyone, what use was it knowing who was running or what was on the news if all it seemed was ever on was old people yelling at each other? It wasn\u2019t like Peter didn\u2019t care about the issues; that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. If he didn\u2019t end up going into crime-fighting full-time after high school, what he really wanted to do was go into environmental engineering and sustainable development. He\u2019d seen all of the heartache and pain that gun violence had brought the city and people he loved, so he knew how important reasonable gun control policy was. And despite all of New York City\u2019s espoused progressive values, Peter\u2019s AP Spanish teacher had come to school with red-rimmed eyes one day, telling the class that him and his husband had just been turned down by another adoption agency for being gay. And college. College was a big one. Tony had repeatedly offered to set him up at MIT\u2014 \u201cThink of it like a scholarship,\u201d he had said,\u2014 but Peter didn\u2019t want to feel like he was getting anything handed to him that he hadn\u2019t earned. May didn\u2019t make too much either, and while they could certainly live off of her salary from the hospital and Uncle Ben\u2019s life insurance for a while, hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loans were a different story.</p><p>Peter flipped the pamphlet around, scanning the front cover. Dignified healthcare. He liked that. Tuition-free higher education. He really liked that. Quality employment. A $15 minimum wage in New York City was great, but still didn\u2019t make ends meet for some people. Justice for all. Sounds about right, Peter thought. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat for Congress NY-14. He\u2019d have to look her up.</p><p>Half an hour later, Peter yawned as he finally closed his laptop from her campaign website, remarkably tired and also pretty sure he had signed up for a mailing list at some point. It was almost one, and he needed to get to bed. Research could wait until morning.</p><hr><p>\tIt was a block day, so after his calculus class had let out, Peter grabbed his lunch from the locker and walked over to the cafeteria, meeting Ned and MJ at their usual table.</p><p>\u201cSup,\u201d Ned said, in between waffle fries.</p><p>Peter looked at him quizcally. \u201cSince when do you say \u2018sup?\u2019\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s a new thing I\u2019m trying out. Doesn\u2019t work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot by a long shot.\u201d</p><p>MJ snorted. \u201cYou guys are a couple of losers, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not?\u201d Ned asked.</p><p>She tilted her head. \u201cThe thing is,\u201d she said, pausing, \u201cI already knew that, and I\u2019ve accepted it. It\u2019s only when you really come to terms with yourself and who you are that you\u2019re able to move on and develop. So what if I\u2019m a little bit of \u00a0loser?\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head, trying to hold back a snort. \u201cHey guys, want to hear something weird that happened to me yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always up for weird,\u201d Ned responded.</p><p>\u201cSo, I was on patrol, and these people were walking around. And at first I thought they were like from the ASPCA or something, you know how they\u2019re always around here?\u201d They nodded. \u201cBut anyways, they weren\u2019t, and I picked up one of the flyers they left by Glen\u2019s, the barber shop, and I got to reading, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, Peter joined a cult,\u201d Ned said, panicking.</p><p>Peter shook his head, reaching down into his backpack to retrieve the pamphlet. \u201cNo, no, I promise it\u2019s not a cult. I guess it was people campaigning for the election, what\u2019s it called, canvassing? Well, it\u2019s people canvassing for this woman running for Congress\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAOC?\u201d MJ asked, interrupting.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAOC. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. That who you\u2019re talking about?\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows furrowed. \u201cYeah, how did you know?\u201d</p><p>The side of her mouth twitched. \u201cI\u2019ve been walking for her since the summer. You know how I\u2019ve been busy on my weekends now?\u201d Peter and Ned nodded. \u201cI\u2019m heading up her youth volunteering. Outreach mostly, getting high schoolers to understand that they deserve to have a say in who\u2019s elected to represent us. Getting them to campaign for someone who actually believes that we all deserve a fair chance. To campaign for someone like them. A young person who\u2019s a woman of color, who didn\u2019t come from money, who cares.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeez, MJ, why don\u2019t you run yourself?\u201d Peter asked, only half-joking.</p><p>\u201cI mean,\u201d she started, grabbing the spare hairband from her wrist and pulling her hair into a ponytail, \u201cobviously I\u2019m too young, but I\u2019m not even sure if I\u2019d want to be the kind of public face that elected officials are. I\u2019d rather be the one calling the shots from behind the scenes, the guy in the chair, if you will,\u201d MJ added, nodding towards Ned.</p><p>\u201cWait, I\u2019m still confused. So who\u2019s she?\u201d Ned asked, looking in between Peter and MJ.</p><p>Peter slid the pamphlet over to his side of the table while MJ grinned. \u201cNow, let me tell you.\u201d</p><hr><p>Ten minutes and two online forms later, MJ had signed both Peter and Ned up for canvassing on Saturday. \u201cI know you\u2019ve got your \u2018Stark thing,\u2019\u201d she had said, using air quotes, \u201cand your actual Stark thing, so I put you down for the morning. You said you\u2019re free then, right?\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t have to be at Tony\u2019s until what, like 2 or something? Plenty of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, and Ned?\u201d</p><p>Ned tilted his head, in that low-key, laidback way of his. \u201cHey, you just tell me what you need and I\u2019m there, MJ. I trust your judgement. You say she\u2019s the real deal?\u201d</p><p>MJ nodded. \u201cShe is. I\u2019ve met her, and I like to pride myself on having what\u2019s probably the best bullshit detector of anyone I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>So Saturday afternoon found Ned, Peter, and MJ crammed into a small and packed but bright office in the north side of Queens, listening to someone who Peter\u2019s pretty sure introduced themself as AOC\u2019s campaign manager. Maybe deputy campaign manager? Peter wasn\u2019t too sure, he didn\u2019t know how these things usually went. But she was standing on a desk, which was cool.</p><p>\u201cYou need to make sure you\u2019re able to ask for their support, see who they\u2019re supporting, and tell them why you support Alexandria.

Javier over there,\u201d she pointed to a young man by the door, who was precariously holding stacks of folders in one hand, \u201chas the district maps and lists of all the houses everyone will be going to, so go see him for that.

Doesn&rsquo;t work?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not by a long shot.&rdquo;</p><p>MJ snorted. &ldquo;You guys are a couple of losers, you know that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re not?&rdquo; Ned asked.</p><p>She tilted her head. &ldquo;The thing is,&rdquo; she said, pausing, &ldquo;I already knew that, and I&rsquo;ve accepted it. It&rsquo;s only when you really come to terms with yourself and who you are that you&rsquo;re able to move on and develop. So what if I&rsquo;m a little bit of &nbsp;loser?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shook his head, trying to hold back a snort. &ldquo;Hey guys, want to hear something weird that happened to me yesterday?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always up for weird,&rdquo; Ned responded.</p><p>&ldquo;So, I was on patrol, and these people were walking around. And at first I thought they were like from the ASPCA or something, you know how they&rsquo;re always around here?&rdquo; They nodded. &ldquo;But anyways, they weren&rsquo;t, and I picked up one of the flyers they left by Glen&rsquo;s, the barber shop, and I got to reading, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, God, Peter joined a cult,&rdquo; Ned said, panicking.</p><p>Peter shook his head, reaching down into his backpack to retrieve the pamphlet. &ldquo;No, no, I promise it&rsquo;s not a cult. I guess it was people campaigning for the election, what&rsquo;s it called, canvassing? Well, it&rsquo;s people canvassing for this woman running for Congress&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;AOC?&rdquo; MJ asked, interrupting.</p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;AOC. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. That who you&rsquo;re talking about?&rdquo;</p><p>His eyebrows furrowed. &ldquo;Yeah, how did you know?&rdquo;</p><p>The side of her mouth twitched. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been walking for her since the summer. You know how I&rsquo;ve been busy on my weekends now?&rdquo; Peter and Ned nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m heading up her youth volunteering. Outreach mostly, getting high schoolers to understand that they deserve to have a say in who&rsquo;s elected to represent us. Getting them to campaign for someone who actually believes that we all deserve a fair chance. To campaign for someone like them. A young person who&rsquo;s a woman of color, who didn&rsquo;t come from money, who cares.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Geez, MJ, why don&rsquo;t you run yourself?&rdquo; Peter asked, only half-joking.</p><p>&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; she started, grabbing the spare hairband from her wrist and pulling her hair into a ponytail, &ldquo;obviously I&rsquo;m too young, but I&rsquo;m not even sure if I&rsquo;d want to be the kind of public face that elected officials are. I&rsquo;d rather be the one calling the shots from behind the scenes, the guy in the chair, if you will,&rdquo; MJ added, nodding towards Ned.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, I&rsquo;m still confused. So who&rsquo;s she?&rdquo; Ned asked, looking in between Peter and MJ.</p><p>Peter slid the pamphlet over to his side of the table while MJ grinned. &ldquo;Now, let me tell you.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>Ten minutes and two online forms later, MJ had signed both Peter and Ned up for canvassing on Saturday. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;ve got your &lsquo;Stark thing,&rsquo;&rdquo; she had said, using air quotes, &ldquo;and your actual Stark thing, so I put you down for the morning. You said you&rsquo;re free then, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nodded. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to be at Tony&rsquo;s until what, like 2 or something? Plenty of time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Great, and Ned?&rdquo;</p><p>Ned tilted his head, in that low-key, laidback way of his. &ldquo;Hey, you just tell me what you need and I&rsquo;m there, MJ. I trust your judgement. You say she&rsquo;s the real deal?&rdquo;</p><p>MJ nodded. &ldquo;She is. I&rsquo;ve met her, and I like to pride myself on having what&rsquo;s probably the best bullshit detector of anyone I&rsquo;ve ever met.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m in.&rdquo;</p><p>So Saturday afternoon found Ned, Peter, and MJ crammed into a small and packed but bright office in the north side of Queens, listening to someone who Peter&rsquo;s pretty sure introduced themself as AOC&rsquo;s campaign manager. Maybe deputy campaign manager? Peter wasn&rsquo;t too sure, he didn&rsquo;t know how these things usually went. But she was standing on a desk, which was cool.</p><p>&ldquo;You need to make sure you&rsquo;re able to ask for their support, see who they&rsquo;re supporting, and tell them why you support Alexandria. This campaign is going to be won by people making connections and ensuring that everyone&rsquo;s voice is heard and everyone feels like they are listened to. Because she&rsquo;s running to represent the entire New York 14th, not only the ones who will vote for her. And I know it might seem tempting, but please, please make sure that you remain cordial to everyone, even if they say they&rsquo;re voting for the other guy or they think her policies are crap. Stay calm, thank them for their time, and move on. This campaign is already an uphill battle, and we don&rsquo;t need anything else stacked against us.&rdquo; She finished her speech with a slight nod of her head. &ldquo;Can I have all of our regular volunteers or field staff raise their hands?&rdquo; About fifteen people in the group of thirty-five or so raised their hands. &ldquo;Alright, anyone who&rsquo;s new or more comfortable with someone more experienced, grab a partner or two and get into groups of two or three. Javier over there,&rdquo; she pointed to a young man by the door, who was precariously holding stacks of folders in one hand, &ldquo;has the district maps and lists of all the houses everyone will be going to, so go see him for that. One per group.&rdquo; She was about to step down, but wheeled around and raised her voice again. &ldquo;Oh, and one more thing&mdash;&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;Alexandria will be stopping in the office around noonish after a town hall she&rsquo;s hosting, so be sure to swing back by if you haven&rsquo;t met her. Fair warning, she&rsquo;s a hugger.&rdquo;</p><p>MJ nudged Peter with her shoulder. &ldquo;You ready?&rdquo;</p><p>He grinned. &ldquo;Oh, hell yeah I am.&rdquo;</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>Totally random one-off idea I&rsquo;ve had floating around for a few months, so bear with me, haha! Only planning for it to be a one-part, but please tell me what y&rsquo;all thing!&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>For the Love of Queens<br /></b></p>\n<p>Late August, 2018</p>\n<p>After the snap, the last thing Peter wanted to do was to get himself in trouble again. He had had his fun already, been to more planets than 99.9998% of the population&mdash; if you rounded to the fourth decimal, he did the math&mdash; and had seen more tragedy than anyone should ever have to experience. But he wasn&rsquo;t willing to hang up the suit. He couldn&rsquo;t. His city still needed him, his people still needed him, and as much as he sometimes wanted to throw in the towel, he couldn&rsquo;t. He had an obligation to help wherever and whenever he could, and that commitment was one he didn&rsquo;t take lightly. If he wasn&rsquo;t going to protect Delmar&rsquo;s bodega, and that kid who had his bike stolen, and that nice Dominican lady who bought him a churro, who would? Spider-Man wasn&rsquo;t gone, but he needed to go back to his roots, back to where he came from. Back to being a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Back to Queens.</p>\n<p>So, almost like someone had spun a Time-Turner back to 2017, Peter was sitting on the edge of a ten-story building a few blocks from his apartment, a #5 in one hand and his phone in the other. But the difference was, this time, he wasn&rsquo;t constantly texting Happy, itching for an assignment, for a chance to prove himself. He was scrolling through a Buzzfeed article entitled &ldquo;46 Memes Guaranteed to Butter Your Eggroll.&rdquo; He needed new material for the Midtown High Instagram page that he, Ned, and MJ ran. Now that his weekends weren&rsquo;t packed full of a potentially universe-ending sojourn to Titan, he had a little more spare time to actually, you know, be a kid for once. He bookmarked the page, finished off the churro, and zipped his phone into one of his suit pockets. Telling Tony he wanted to take a step back from the Avengers, having that conversation with him, was one of the hardest things Peter had ever had to do. There was nothing he hated more than disappointing people. Compounding that with the fact that Tony was probably the closest thing he had to a dad since Ben died, and Peter was practically shaking when he told him he wanted to ease up on missions. Tony was strangely understanding about the whole thing, even though Peter wasn&rsquo;t too sure why he expected otherwise, and pulled him into a hug, telling him to &ldquo;do what you need to do, kid.&rdquo; And as soon as Petter reassured him that he did want to keep working with him, just maybe make the &ldquo;Stark internship&rdquo; less Avenging and more STEM-y, he nodded, made a thirty-second phone call to Pepper, and told him to show up Monday after school.</p>\n</p>",

We've seen how much Tony differentiates between nicknames. There is no way Tony wouldn't call Peter every single nickname he can think of. Also, we need to use Underoos more often as well in my opinion. Since that is something strictly between them. Like only ever Tony will call Peter Underoos. And I think P would love that fact",
