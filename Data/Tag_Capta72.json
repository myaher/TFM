Jessica Drew in the comics is a very integral and important relationship and part of Carol\u2019s life and story. Jess was there to help Carol recover her memories the first time she lost them to Rouge and continues to be her #1 supporter and best friend. Jess also has a comic arc where she becomes a single mother in her stand alone comic issues. Carol was there for her after Secret Invasion and continues to support her. They are each other\u2019s support system and best friend, to the point where it is totally plausible for them to fall into a relationship, aka CarolJess. They have not introduced Spider-Woman to the MCU, and it would be awkward in the setting and story timeline Captain Marvel takes place in.  </p><p>They also needed to address Monica Rambeau as well, since she carried the title before and has similar powers. </p><p>So what do they do? It would be better if Monica was an adult in the present time, that would mean she would be a child when Captain Marvel takes place. And they transfer that deep relationship and support Carol has with Jess over to Monica\u2019s mother, Maria. Maria is a single mother as well, who Carol helps support; and they both have each other\u2019s backs as pilots and best friends. Maria helps Carol with her amnesia like Jess does, albeit in a different way. So unless they introduce Jessica Drew later on, this is what got formulated in my brain. Jess and Carol\u2019s history and relationship are too important to not be addressed at all in the MCU when it is sooo important in the comics. </p>",

In Grind it\u2019s the opposite, both Gerry and Curtis like to gamble, that\u2019s a fact, and they do for very different reasons. And they\u2019re good to each other and for one and other, but are they good people, or not? That is what we\u2019re here to find out and every chapter of the trip we think we have them figured ou, but we never entirely do, to the very last shot.</p><p>The unreliable company seems to be present in both stories. Vers seems too confident and abrupt in how she judges people, and that has to crack. Gerry and Curtis think they know know each other enough to travel together, they aknowledge each other\u2019s dark side as acceptable risk. They\u2019ll be (and us) surprised at every opportunity. Does Gerry think that he\u2019s helping Curtis settle down? Is smiley/self-loathing Curtis think he\u2019s helping Gerry by tricking him out of the horse race winnings?</p><p>The pinnacle of mirrored themes to me comes once again with Mendelsohn\u2019s character at the center. In Captain Marvel, the directors keep showing us that Thalos is softer than we first believe when he zaps and captures Carol. He\u2019s funny while messing with her memories, he\u2019s heartfelt when he meets up with his dead comrade, and he\u2019s cooperative when he meets up with the crew at Maria\u2019s house. And yet, when we see that Mar-Vell\u2019s space lab is occupied and Thalos begins what appears to be a battle cry, we swing back to distrusting him, \u201cIt\u2019s a trap!\u201d, but once again our fears are unfounded. It\u2019s not a trap, we now trust the kindness of strangers. Meanwhile in Grind, Gerry who can\u2019t seem to enjoy anything good that comes his way, either it being money or even a friend, seems to destroy his last relationship by leaving Curtis behind only to reaffirm that he does have at some level an interest in having his new acquaintance live a happier, more fulfilling life.</p>",
