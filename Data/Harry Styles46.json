She was\nglad that she\u2019d finally reached the end of the first trimester, her morning\nsickness had almost vanished and her energy had started to come back. The last\ntwo weeks had been hell, she was tired the second she woke up and she could\nbarely eat anything without throwing it up. Making it through the work day had\nbeen rough, but she was grateful she had Ella and Grimmy to cover for her while\nshe took a power nap in her lunch break. She was coming out of it now though\nand while she wasn\u2019t out of the woods in terms of the high-risk pregnancy, she\nwas glad that she was feeling better.</p><p>It was a\nFriday, and since Poppy had Friday\u2019s off now, she\u2019d spent the day running a few\nbasic errands, stocking up on groceries and ducking into a few high street\nstores to buy some basic Maternity wear. She had the slightest bump now, still\nnot enough for people to notice when she was wearing loose clothing, but her\njeans were getting uncomfortable, and she could always find an excuse to go to\nTopShop.

After giving herself a few\nminutes to allow her tears to dry, she went out to the kitchen to make herself\na cup of tea and call her sister. she sat at her counter and dialled the\nnumber, waiting for her to answer</p><p>\u201cPoppy!\nHaven\u2019t heard from you for a while, how\u2019s London?\u201d Emma answered. </p><p>\u201cVery\nBritish\u201d Poppy laughed</p><p>\u201cNever\nwould have guessed\u201d she said sarcastically</p><p>\u201cSo, Mum\ntells me you\u2019re at a boy\u2019s house\u201d Poppy questioned.

So\nfar, she\u2019d contacted three hospitals, and all of them flat out refused to rent\nout a heart rate monitor to a radio station, which Poppy thought was\nreasonable, but it was still her job to find someone that would.</p><p>Ella was\nworking away happily at her desk, answering calls and taking messages for\ndifferent members of staff when Poppy heard her say Harry\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cHarry\nStyles is here?\u201d she said, curiously into the phone, turning around to look at\nher. He arrived back from L.A. late last night and went straight back to his\nhouse, so he wouldn\u2019t wake Poppy up, but that meant that it had almost been a\nweek since she\u2019d seen him.

She was\nglad that she\u2019d finally reached the end of the first trimester, her morning\nsickness had almost vanished and her energy had started to come back. The last\ntwo weeks had been hell, she was tired the second she woke up and she could\nbarely eat anything without throwing it up. Making it through the work day had\nbeen rough, but she was grateful she had Ella and Grimmy to cover for her while\nshe took a power nap in her lunch break. She was coming out of it now though\nand while she wasn\u2019t out of the woods in terms of the high-risk pregnancy, she\nwas glad that she was feeling better.</p><p>It was a\nFriday, and since Poppy had Friday\u2019s off now, she\u2019d spent the day running a few\nbasic errands, stocking up on groceries and ducking into a few high street\nstores to buy some basic Maternity wear. She had the slightest bump now, still\nnot enough for people to notice when she was wearing loose clothing, but her\njeans were getting uncomfortable, and she could always find an excuse to go to\nTopShop. She still hadn\u2019t told her family, and she was still nervous to admit\nit in case something happened, but 12 weeks was traditionally when people\nannounced their pregnancies, so that\u2019s why she was sitting on her bed at 9pm,\nlaptop open, waiting for her mum to answer the skype call.</p><p>\u201cWell hello\nthere Miss Poppy, I wasn\u2019t expecting a call from you this morning\u201d her mum\nanswered, pointing the camera up towards the ceiling so that Poppy couldn\u2019t see\nher face, she could tell that it was a nice day from the lighting in the room\nand she suddenly found herself missing the cold June days spent at home by the\nfire, the smell of her mums soup filling the air.</p><p>\u201cHi Mum, I\ncan\u2019t see your face if you point the camera up like that\u201d she said giggling,\nglad to be talking her</p><p>\u201cOh that\u2019s\nok, you don\u2019t want to see my face anyway\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really\ndo, I haven\u2019t seen you since Christmas, I miss your face\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, but\ndon\u2019t complain about my chins\u201d she aimed the camera back at her face \u201cSo, why\nhave I been honoured with your call this fine Saturday morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I\njust call for a chat?\u201d Poppy stalled, sudden butterflies filling her stomach. </p><p>\u201cYou can,\nbut you don\u2019t\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nright, I have some news\u201d she sighed \u201cIs Dad there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s\naround here somewhere\u201d she turned around looking for her dad \u201cis it good news?\u201d</p><p>Poppy\nsmiled widely \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s great news Mum\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Her mum\nturned back around and looked straight at Poppy through the screen \u201cAre you\ncoming home?\u201d</p><p>Poppy shook\nher head \u201cNo mum, I\u2019m not coming home, London\u2019s home now\u201d</p><p>She let out\na big sigh \u201cThis will always be your home Poppy\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know\nmum, but you know what I mean\u201d she smiled \u201cNow go find Dad, and Emma too if\nshe\u2019s around\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s at\nthat boys house again, you\u2019ll have to call her later\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, I\ncan do that, but get Dad now and I\u2019ll tell you\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright\nalright\u201d she turned around again \u201cJohn!\u201d she called \u201cPoppy\u2019s on the computer\nthing, she\u2019s got something to tell us\u201d she turned back to the screen \u201cHe\u2019s in\nhis corner, he\u2019s on his way though\u201d</p><p>She heard\nher dad walk into the room where their computer sat \u201cWhat\u2019d you say love\u201d</p><p>Her mum\nrolled her eyes \u201cPoppy\u2019s on the computer call, she\u2019s got some news\u201d</p><p>John\u2019s\ntorso appeared in the screen \u201cOh hello darling, how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m great\ndad, how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh I\u2019m\nalright\u201d he sighed \u201cStill haven\u2019t retired, but I\u2019m getting by\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did\nyou want to tell us Poppy?\u201d her mum chimed in, obviously eager to hear the news</p><p>\u201cOh, Uh,\u201d\nPoppy bit her lip, butterflies forming in the pit of her stomach again, her\nparents were very traditional, and they\u2019d always told her that she needed to be\nmarried before she had a baby, and Poppy always thought she would be, but\nthings don\u2019t always go to plan, and she knew that they\u2019d be happy for her\neventually, but at first, she wasn\u2019t sure how they\u2019d react.</p><p>\u201cEverything\nok?\u201d her \u00a0Mum asked</p><p>\u201cYeah Mum,\neverything\u2019s great, I\u2019m\u201d she swallowed the lump in her throat, trying to hold\nback the tears \u201cI\u2019m pregnant\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my\ngoodness\u201d her mum brought her hands to her face, covering her mouth and her\nDad, stood there in silence \u201chow far along?\u201d</p><p>\u201c12 weeks,\ntoday\u201d Poppy smiled</p><p>Her Dad\ncleared his throat \u201cWho\u2019s the, uh, who\u2019s the father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm\u201d Poppy\nfrowned \u201chis name\u2019s Danny, but he doesn\u2019t want anything to do with it\u201d</p><p>Both\n\u00a0parents frowned with her for a moment, her mum finally breaking the\nsilence \u201cPoppy, dear, I think you should think about moving back home, you\ncan\u2019t do this by yourself\u201d</p><p>Poppy knew\nher mum would try and convince her to move home, she\u2019d been doing it for the\npast four years, but she didn\u2019t think she would straight out say she couldn\u2019t\ndo it on her own.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\nreally doing it on my own mum\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do\nyou mean?\u201d she asked, confused</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got\nHarry\u201d</p><p>She laughed\n\u201cAnd what happens when Harry goes away on tour?

So\nfar, she\u2019d contacted three hospitals, and all of them flat out refused to rent\nout a heart rate monitor to a radio station, which Poppy thought was\nreasonable, but it was still her job to find someone that would.</p><p>Ella was\nworking away happily at her desk, answering calls and taking messages for\ndifferent members of staff when Poppy heard her say Harry\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cHarry\nStyles is here?\u201d she said, curiously into the phone, turning around to look at\nher. He arrived back from L.A. late last night and went straight back to his\nhouse, so he wouldn\u2019t wake Poppy up, but that meant that it had almost been a\nweek since she\u2019d seen him. Poppy shrugged her shoulders at Ella, not knowing\nwhy he was here either.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not\nscheduled to be in until next week, but let him anyway, I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t cause\ntoo much trouble\u201d Poppy\u2019s stomach dropped at the thought of seeing him after\nhaving that conversation with her mum the other day.

She was\nglad that she&rsquo;d finally reached the end of the first trimester, her morning\nsickness had almost vanished and her energy had started to come back. The last\ntwo weeks had been hell, she was tired the second she woke up and she could\nbarely eat anything without throwing it up. Making it through the work day had\nbeen rough, but she was grateful she had Ella and Grimmy to cover for her while\nshe took a power nap in her lunch break. She was coming out of it now though\nand while she wasn&rsquo;t out of the woods in terms of the high-risk pregnancy, she\nwas glad that she was feeling better.</p><p>It was a\nFriday, and since Poppy had Friday&rsquo;s off now, she&rsquo;d spent the day running a few\nbasic errands, stocking up on groceries and ducking into a few high street\nstores to buy some basic Maternity wear. She had the slightest bump now, still\nnot enough for people to notice when she was wearing loose clothing, but her\njeans were getting uncomfortable, and she could always find an excuse to go to\nTopShop. She still hadn&rsquo;t told her family, and she was still nervous to admit\nit in case something happened, but 12 weeks was traditionally when people\nannounced their pregnancies, so that&rsquo;s why she was sitting on her bed at 9pm,\nlaptop open, waiting for her mum to answer the skype call.</p><p>&ldquo;Well hello\nthere Miss Poppy, I wasn&rsquo;t expecting a call from you this morning&rdquo; her mum\nanswered, pointing the camera up towards the ceiling so that Poppy couldn&rsquo;t see\nher face, she could tell that it was a nice day from the lighting in the room\nand she suddenly found herself missing the cold June days spent at home by the\nfire, the smell of her mums soup filling the air.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi Mum, I\ncan&rsquo;t see your face if you point the camera up like that&rdquo; she said giggling,\nglad to be talking her</p><p>&ldquo;Oh that&rsquo;s\nok, you don&rsquo;t want to see my face anyway&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I really\ndo, I haven&rsquo;t seen you since Christmas, I miss your face&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine, but\ndon&rsquo;t complain about my chins&rdquo; she aimed the camera back at her face &ldquo;So, why\nhave I been honoured with your call this fine Saturday morning?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I\njust call for a chat?&rdquo; Poppy stalled, sudden butterflies filling her stomach. </p><p>&ldquo;You can,\nbut you don&rsquo;t&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re\nright, I have some news&rdquo; she sighed &ldquo;Is Dad there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, he&rsquo;s\naround here somewhere&rdquo; she turned around looking for her dad &ldquo;is it good news?&rdquo;</p><p>Poppy\nsmiled widely &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great news Mum&rdquo;</p><p>Her mum\nturned back around and looked straight at Poppy through the screen &ldquo;Are you\ncoming home?&rdquo;</p><p>Poppy shook\nher head &ldquo;No mum, I&rsquo;m not coming home, London&rsquo;s home now&rdquo;</p><p>She let out\na big sigh &ldquo;This will always be your home Poppy&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know\nmum, but you know what I mean&rdquo; she smiled &ldquo;Now go find Dad, and Emma too if\nshe&rsquo;s around&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s at\nthat boys house again, you&rsquo;ll have to call her later&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, I\ncan do that, but get Dad now and I&rsquo;ll tell you&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright\nalright&rdquo; she turned around again &ldquo;John!&rdquo; she called &ldquo;Poppy&rsquo;s on the computer\nthing, she&rsquo;s got something to tell us&rdquo; she turned back to the screen &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in\nhis corner, he&rsquo;s on his way though&rdquo;</p><p>She heard\nher dad walk into the room where their computer sat &ldquo;What&rsquo;d you say love&rdquo;</p><p>Her mum\nrolled her eyes &ldquo;Poppy&rsquo;s on the computer call, she&rsquo;s got some news&rdquo;</p><p>John&rsquo;s\ntorso appeared in the screen &ldquo;Oh hello darling, how are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m great\ndad, how are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m\nalright&rdquo; he sighed &ldquo;Still haven&rsquo;t retired, but I&rsquo;m getting by&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What did\nyou want to tell us Poppy?&rdquo; her mum chimed in, obviously eager to hear the news</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Uh,&rdquo;\nPoppy bit her lip, butterflies forming in the pit of her stomach again, her\nparents were very traditional, and they&rsquo;d always told her that she needed to be\nmarried before she had a baby, and Poppy always thought she would be, but\nthings don&rsquo;t always go to plan, and she knew that they&rsquo;d be happy for her\neventually, but at first, she wasn&rsquo;t sure how they&rsquo;d react.</p><p>&ldquo;Everything\nok?&rdquo; her &nbsp;Mum asked</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah Mum,\neverything&rsquo;s great, I&rsquo;m&rdquo; she swallowed the lump in her throat, trying to hold\nback the tears &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pregnant&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my\ngoodness&rdquo; her mum brought her hands to her face, covering her mouth and her\nDad, stood there in silence &ldquo;how far along?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;12 weeks,\ntoday&rdquo; Poppy smiled</p><p>Her Dad\ncleared his throat &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the, uh, who&rsquo;s the father?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um&rdquo; Poppy\nfrowned &ldquo;his name&rsquo;s Danny, but he doesn&rsquo;t want anything to do with it&rdquo;</p><p>Both\n&nbsp;parents frowned with her for a moment, her mum finally breaking the\nsilence &ldquo;Poppy, dear, I think you should think about moving back home, you\ncan&rsquo;t do this by yourself&rdquo;</p><p>Poppy knew\nher mum would try and convince her to move home, she&rsquo;d been doing it for the\npast four years, but she didn&rsquo;t think she would straight out say she couldn&rsquo;t\ndo it on her own.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not\nreally doing it on my own mum&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do\nyou mean?&rdquo; she asked, confused</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got\nHarry&rdquo;</p><p>She laughed\n&ldquo;And what happens when Harry goes away on tour?

Her\nmum was right in being sceptical about Harry&rsquo;s role in all this, Poppy, herself\nwere a little sceptical about how it was all going to work, but she knew that\nhe was always going to be there, and that he would love this little prince just\nas much as she did, and that was enough for her. After giving herself a few\nminutes to allow her tears to dry, she went out to the kitchen to make herself\na cup of tea and call her sister. she sat at her counter and dialled the\nnumber, waiting for her to answer</p><p>&ldquo;Poppy!\nHaven&rsquo;t heard from you for a while, how&rsquo;s London?&rdquo; Emma answered. </p><p>&ldquo;Very\nBritish&rdquo; Poppy laughed</p><p>&ldquo;Never\nwould have guessed&rdquo; she said sarcastically</p><p>&ldquo;So, Mum\ntells me you&rsquo;re at a boy&rsquo;s house&rdquo; Poppy questioned. Anna was 20 now, she had\nher own life and her own things going on, but Poppy would always see her as the\n16-year-old she was when she moved to London.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just\nMatt, he&rsquo;s my Harry, but like, less famous&rdquo;</p><p>Poppy\nsmiled at the thought of her having someone as supportive as Harry &ldquo;That&rsquo;s\ngreat Em, how&rsquo;s uni going?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\ngreat, I&rsquo;m really enjoying it&rdquo; she said cheerfully &ldquo;hey, isn&rsquo;t it Friday night\nthere, shouldn&rsquo;t you be out doing fun things with your cool friends and not\ncalling your little sister&rdquo;</p><p>Poppy\ngiggled &ldquo;My friends aren&rsquo;t that cool, they&rsquo;re all at home alone too, I called\nbecause I have some news&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you\ncoming home?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, and\nyou&rsquo;ve been spending too much time with Mum&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I\nknow&rdquo; she sighed into the mouthpiece &ldquo;Anyway, what&rsquo;s your news&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m having\na baby Emma&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my\ngod!&rdquo; she screamed into the phone and Poppy held it away from her ear &ldquo;is it\nHarry&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ummm No&rdquo;\nshe said confused, thinking about what she just said about Matt &ldquo;You know how\nbabies happen right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You gotta\ndo the sex usually&rdquo; she said matter-of-factly</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;ve\nliterally never done that with Harry&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&rdquo; she\nsounded taken aback &ldquo;So you two aren&rsquo;t friends with benefits?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nooooo&rdquo;\nshe said, lowering the tone of her voice &ldquo;does that mean that you and Matt are\nfriends with benefits?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yep&rdquo; she\nwas starting to sound a little awkward</p><p>&ldquo;Ok, well\nlike, use protection, don&rsquo;t make the same mistake I did&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So who is\nthe Dad?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Some dude\nnamed Danny, apparently his sperm has more stamina than he does&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok gross,\nI don&rsquo;t need the details&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah ok\nsorry, you really don&rsquo;t&rdquo; Poppy cleared her throat &ldquo;anyway, you&rsquo;re going to be\nan aunt in a few months&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When is it\ndue?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s due\nin December,&rdquo; she emphasized the &lsquo;he&rsquo; as an easy way to tell her the sex, &ldquo;but\nhe&rsquo;ll probably be early&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;it&rsquo;s a he?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a\nboy&rdquo; Poppy smiled even though she knew that Emma couldn&rsquo;t see her</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god,\nis Kiwi about you?&rdquo; Poppy was surprised by the sudden change of topic &ldquo;Is that\nwhy he posted that photo on Instagram?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um no,\nthat song was written like more than a year ago, I&rsquo;m a little offended that you\nthink it&rsquo;s about me to be honest&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, I\nhad to ask&rdquo; she laughed &ldquo;Congratulations Poppy, this is the most adult thing\nyou&rsquo;ve ever done&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,\nit&rsquo;s terrifying&rdquo;</p><p>***</p><p>July 4<sup>th</sup> 2017 &ndash; 12 weeks</p><p>Poppy was\nsitting at her desk, staring out her window at the beautiful blue that was\nblessing the London sky, wishing she was outside enjoying the pleasant weather,\ninstead of being cooped up inside trying desperately to find a heart rate\nmonitor for some ridiculous game Nick wanted to play with Harry next week. So\nfar, she&rsquo;d contacted three hospitals, and all of them flat out refused to rent\nout a heart rate monitor to a radio station, which Poppy thought was\nreasonable, but it was still her job to find someone that would.</p><p>Ella was\nworking away happily at her desk, answering calls and taking messages for\ndifferent members of staff when Poppy heard her say Harry&rsquo;s name.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry\nStyles is here?&rdquo; she said, curiously into the phone, turning around to look at\nher. He arrived back from L.A. late last night and went straight back to his\nhouse, so he wouldn&rsquo;t wake Poppy up, but that meant that it had almost been a\nweek since she&rsquo;d seen him. Poppy shrugged her shoulders at Ella, not knowing\nwhy he was here either.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not\nscheduled to be in until next week, but let him anyway, I&rsquo;m sure he won&rsquo;t cause\ntoo much trouble&rdquo; Poppy&rsquo;s stomach dropped at the thought of seeing him after\nhaving that conversation with her mum the other day. Ella winked at her and put\nthe phone down &ldquo;Did you know he was coming?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I had no\nidea, I haven&rsquo;t spoken to him since he got home from L.A&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Trouble in\nparadise?&rdquo; she asked, a tone of menace in her voice</p><p>Poppy\npicked up the pad of post-it-notes that were sitting next to her laptop and\nplayfully threw them at her &ldquo;Shut up El, there&rsquo;s nothing going on between us&rdquo;</p><p>The\nelevator doors opened on the other side of the room and Harry walked out,\nwearing a hoodie and his paperboy hat, carrying what looked like a gift bag and\na tray of coffee&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr Styles&rdquo;\nElla said, very professionally</p><p>Harry\nfurrowed his brow at her formal introduction, which was out of character for\nher, &ldquo;Yeah hey Ella&rdquo; he handed her a coffee from the tray &ldquo;Mocha, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oooh thank\nyou&rdquo; she said taking the cup off him &ldquo;you should visit more often&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think\nabout it&rdquo; he said as he made his way over to Poppy&rsquo;s desk, placing the gift bag\nand another cup of coffee in front of her &ldquo;Hey baby Mumma&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hiya&rdquo; she\nsaid, looking at the cup in front of her, feeling the butterflies rise in her\nstomach as he smiled at her</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s tea&rdquo;\nhe said reassuringly</p><p>&ldquo;Great&rdquo; she\ntook a sip &ldquo;how was your flight home?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was\nalright&rdquo; he nodded, pushing the gift bag closer to her &ldquo;Got you a little\nsomething in L.A&rdquo; Poppy frowned at him, pulling the bag closer to her &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t\ngive me that face love, it&rsquo;s not really for you, it&rsquo;s for the little man&rdquo;</p><p>The frown\ndisappeared from her face as she looked inside the bag to see a flat white box\nwith a &lsquo;Gucci&rsquo; logo embossed in the middle &ldquo;Harry!&rdquo; she exclaimed, pulling it\nout of the bag as he smirked, pulling a chair over from the reception area</p><p>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo; he\nasked innocently</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nGucci&rdquo; she untied the ribbon that held the box shut and pulled the lid off,\nrevealing a<a href=\"https://www.childsplayclothing.co.uk/designers/gucci/gucci-baby-boys-fine-wool-knit-bear-romper\"> navy blue baby grow, covered in yellow teddy bears</a></p><p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you like\nit?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love it\nH&rdquo; she said, touching the fabric &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so soft&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s 100%\nwool, and I figured since he&rsquo;s a winter baby, that it will come in handy&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\ngreat, thank you H&rdquo; she stood from her chair and opened her arms to hug him\n&ldquo;Kid&rsquo;s not even born yet and he already owns more designer clothes than I do&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And who&rsquo;s\nfault is that?&rdquo;</p><p>Herr mouth\ntwitched into a smirk &ldquo;Mine&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm,\nexactly&rdquo; he smiled &ldquo;12 weeks, how does it feel?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t\npuked in 3 days, it&rsquo;s wonderful&rdquo; she laughed, pulling her shirt tight over her\nbelly &ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;ve even got a bump&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes\nwidened, and he reached his arm out, stopping just before he touched her &ldquo;may\nI?&rdquo; Poppy nodded, grabbing his hand and placing it over the bump, enjoying the\nintimacy of the act. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s\nyour God Son&rdquo;</p><p>His smiled\nwidened and his eyes sparkled with excitement &ldquo;He&rsquo;s really in there&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh would\nyou two get a room&rdquo; Ella called from her desk, watching as Harry removed his\nhand from her belly and sat back down in the chair he&rsquo;d taken over to her desk.</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up\nElla&rdquo; Poppy laughed &ldquo;Get some work done&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I could\nsay the same to you&rdquo; she tutted</p><p>&ldquo;Ooh,\nactually on that note&rdquo; she pulled a calendar out from her desk draw, &ldquo;H, when\ncan you come in for your live lounge?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uhhh&rdquo; he\npulled his phone out from his pocket and checked his calendar &ldquo;Any time in the\nfirst three weeks of August&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How about\nthe 19<sup>th</sup>?&rdquo; she said looking at the schedule</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure\nthat&rsquo;s fine, but leave it with me and I&rsquo;ll let you know for sure in a few days&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Great&rdquo; she\nsaid taking a pencil out from her tin and wrote his name on the 19<sup>th</sup> with a question mark next to it &ldquo;See Ella, we&rsquo;re working&rdquo; she\nrolled her eyes and turned back to her desk, opening her own laptop to get some\nwork done.</p><p>Poppy\nnoticed the last cup of coffee in the tray that Harry had brought in with him\n&ldquo;who&rsquo;s that for H?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Grimmer&rsquo;s\nif he&rsquo;s still in&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He is&rdquo;\nPoppy stood from her chair &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go find him, I need to talk to him anyway&rdquo;</p><p>Harry\nfollowed her down the hallway to Grimmy&rsquo;s studio, where he was busy doing some\nproduction work. She knocked on the door and opened it as nick took his head\nphones off and placed them on the desk</p><p>&ldquo;Hiya&rdquo; he\nsaid, a wide smile on his face &ldquo;Ready for lunch, are we?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I could go\nfor some lunch&rdquo; Harry said, walking in behind her</p><p>&ldquo;Styles!&rdquo;\nNick exclaimed, not expecting to see Harry today, &ldquo;What are ya doing here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He wants\nmore radio play&rdquo; she winked and Harry handed grimmy the cup of coffee &ldquo;so you\nknow that thing you wanted me to get for your interview with this guy next\nweek?&rdquo; Poppy pointed at Harry</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t\nknow if it&rsquo;s going to happen, but I haven&rsquo;t given up yet&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be\ngoing to any extra trouble for me, and don&rsquo;t get yourself stressed&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes H&rdquo; she\nrolled her eyes, secretly enjoying how much he cared for her, &ldquo;Now, Mumma&rsquo;s\nhungry, let&rsquo;s get some food&rdquo;</p><p>Grimmy\nstood up from his chair, &ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s go then, before you kill us both&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just\nget something delivered, I&rsquo;ve got work to do&rdquo;</p></p>",

She was\nglad that she&rsquo;d finally reached the end of the first trimester, her morning\nsickness had almost vanished and her energy had started to come back. The last\ntwo weeks had been hell, she was tired the second she woke up and she could\nbarely eat anything without throwing it up. Making it through the work day had\nbeen rough, but she was grateful she had Ella and Grimmy to cover for her while\nshe took a power nap in her lunch break. She was coming out of it now though\nand while she wasn&rsquo;t out of the woods in terms of the high-risk pregnancy, she\nwas glad that she was feeling better.</p>\n<p>It was a\nFriday, and since Poppy had Friday&rsquo;s off now, she&rsquo;d spent the day running a few\nbasic errands, stocking up on groceries and ducking into a few high street\nstores to buy some basic Maternity wear. She had the slightest bump now, still\nnot enough for people to notice when she was wearing loose clothing, but her\njeans were getting uncomfortable, and she could always find an excuse to go to\nTopShop. She still hadn&rsquo;t told her family, and she was still nervous to admit\nit in case something happened, but 12 weeks was traditionally when people\nannounced their pregnancies, so that&rsquo;s why she was sitting on her bed at 9pm,\nlaptop open, waiting for her mum to answer the skype call.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well hello\nthere Miss Poppy, I wasn&rsquo;t expecting a call from you this morning&rdquo; her mum\nanswered, pointing the camera up towards the ceiling so that Poppy couldn&rsquo;t see\nher face, she could tell that it was a nice day from the lighting in the room\nand she suddenly found herself missing the cold June days spent at home by the\nfire, the smell of her mums soup filling the air.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hi Mum, I\ncan&rsquo;t see your face if you point the camera up like that&rdquo; she said giggling,\nglad to be talking her</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh that&rsquo;s\nok, you don&rsquo;t want to see my face anyway&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I really\ndo, I haven&rsquo;t seen you since Christmas, I miss your face&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Fine, but\ndon&rsquo;t complain about my chins&rdquo; she aimed the camera back at her face &ldquo;So, why\nhave I been honoured with your call this fine Saturday morning?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I\njust call for a chat?&rdquo; Poppy stalled, sudden butterflies filling her stomach. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;You can,\nbut you don&rsquo;t&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re\nright, I have some news&rdquo; she sighed &ldquo;Is Dad there?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah, he&rsquo;s\naround here somewhere&rdquo; she turned around looking for her dad &ldquo;is it good news?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Poppy\nsmiled widely &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great news Mum&rdquo;</p>\n</p>",

        "answer": "<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It had bee over five months, maybe even more. But, Y/N didn\u2019t care. For some reason time had become a blur to her. She didn\u2019t know what she was doing, what was happening. She hated herself for still being stuck to something that happened so long ago, or maybe it happened just yesterday, at least it felt like it.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 These past few months, Y/N felt like she wasn\u2019t human anymore. After Y/N had found out about the other girl, she thought of leaving, she really did. She really didn\u2019t want to give anyone, especially her little sister the idea that it was okay if someone treated her like that. But, she couldn\u2019t bring herself to do it. Y/N loved him. And, he loved her, at least that what he told her.</p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 I love you. </i></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Y/N and Harry had always been the lovey-dovey couple. They couldn\u2019t keep their hands off of each other. Even when they weren\u2019t officially public, there wasn\u2019t one picture of them walking in the London streets without their hands entangled. Y/N loved it though. It made her feel special. And after they had finally said \u2018I love you\u2019 to each other, it had become like a mantra between them They hadn\u2019t gone one\u00a0single day in their \u00a0two years relationship without saying those words. Even when he went on tour they always\u00a0texted to remind each other. But, one day it had stopped coming from him And that was the first thing that made Y/N realized maybe something was wrong, but never in hundred years she thought he\u2019d be unfaithful to her. At first she thought, he had forgotten and she brushed it off without even thinking about it. But, soon it wasn\u2019t just the \u2018I love you\u2019s that changed, their kisses, their touch, their love everything changed with time. And finally after she had confronted him, to her relief he hadn\u2019t lied. He accepted what he had done and later cried for her to stay and claimed to love her. And she still did too, so she stayed. However, nothing was like they used to be. They held hands, they kissed, they said \u2018I love you\u2019s to each other but nothing felt same. It was just like the time Harry was cheating on her. But this time Harry wasn\u2019t the reason, this time Y/N was.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 One thing, that made Y/N still have a little respect for him was the fact that he had never touched her during those three months. It was killing her then, though. She thought he wasn\u2019t attracted to her anymore. She had somehow convinced herself she had gained weight and literally starved herself for him. She felt pathetic to think about it now. Harry hadn\u2019t touched her because he felt guilty, he felt as if he was taking advantage of her. There were many times in those three months\u00a0 Y/N had tried to make him do it, and he\u2019d give in at first but after just few minutes, he\u2019d just leave her or go to sleep saying he didn\u2019t feel good. It hurt her a lot that time, but now it was one of the reason she was still with him.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 It had been a while since she had been intimate with him. She couldn\u2019t even remember the last time, they had done it. Maybe it was the night before he had left for the tour. And it had been eight months since then.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Harry too missed the intimate moments they used to share. Yes, he did cheat on her but that was the biggest regret of his life. He still couldn\u2019t remember why he had done it, he could only remember one night he had gotten too drunk and the next day he woke up next to Caroline, a German model. And it would\u2019ve been fine then, maybe he would\u2019ve been able to blame it on the drinks maybe, and he wouldn\u2019t have hurt Y/N so bad. But, he had done it again and again and at one point it became a habit of his. But, even then Caroline could never make up for what Y/N had made him feel.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHey, baby how was your day?\u201d Harry spoke the moment he saw Y/N enter their house.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cIt was good,\u201d Y/N replied, but the way she spoke, it reveled something completely different.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYou look tired,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she replied curtly.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 From the day she had confronted him, she was nothing but cold. Harry, didn\u2019t blame her though, he <i>had</i> cheated on her, <i>for crying out loud</i>. She could be as cold and hateful she wanted to be, he just wanted to be forgiven and get back the thing they had. But, Harry didn\u2019t if that wish of his would ever come too.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cOkay, uh freshen up I\u2019ll serve the dinner,\u201d Harry forced a smile on his face.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI think I\u2019ll skip tonight,\u201d Y/N replied and went upstairs without even looking back at him. <i>It hurt Harry</i>, he was not going to lie, <i>it hurt a lot</i> but he couldn\u2019t blame anyone other than himself.

            "comment": "<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It had bee over five months, maybe even more. But, Y/N didn\u2019t care. For some reason time had become a blur to her. She didn\u2019t know what she was doing, what was happening. She hated herself for still being stuck to something that happened so long ago, or maybe it happened just yesterday, at least it felt like it.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 These past few months, Y/N felt like she wasn\u2019t human anymore. After Y/N had found out about the other girl, she thought of leaving, she really did. She really didn\u2019t want to give anyone, especially her little sister the idea that it was okay if someone treated her like that. But, she couldn\u2019t bring herself to do it. Y/N loved him. And, he loved her, at least that what he told her.</p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 I love you. </i></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Y/N and Harry had always been the lovey-dovey couple. They couldn\u2019t keep their hands off of each other. Even when they weren\u2019t officially public, there wasn\u2019t one picture of them walking in the London streets without their hands entangled. Y/N loved it though. It made her feel special. And after they had finally said \u2018I love you\u2019 to each other, it had become like a mantra between them They hadn\u2019t gone one\u00a0single day in their \u00a0two years relationship without saying those words. Even when he went on tour they always\u00a0texted to remind each other. But, one day it had stopped coming from him And that was the first thing that made Y/N realized maybe something was wrong, but never in hundred years she thought he\u2019d be unfaithful to her. At first she thought, he had forgotten and she brushed it off without even thinking about it. But, soon it wasn\u2019t just the \u2018I love you\u2019s that changed, their kisses, their touch, their love everything changed with time. And finally after she had confronted him, to her relief he hadn\u2019t lied. He accepted what he had done and later cried for her to stay and claimed to love her. And she still did too, so she stayed. However, nothing was like they used to be. They held hands, they kissed, they said \u2018I love you\u2019s to each other but nothing felt same. It was just like the time Harry was cheating on her. But this time Harry wasn\u2019t the reason, this time Y/N was.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 One thing, that made Y/N still have a little respect for him was the fact that he had never touched her during those three months. It was killing her then, though. She thought he wasn\u2019t attracted to her anymore. She had somehow convinced herself she had gained weight and literally starved herself for him. She felt pathetic to think about it now. Harry hadn\u2019t touched her because he felt guilty, he felt as if he was taking advantage of her. There were many times in those three months\u00a0 Y/N had tried to make him do it, and he\u2019d give in at first but after just few minutes, he\u2019d just leave her or go to sleep saying he didn\u2019t feel good. It hurt her a lot that time, but now it was one of the reason she was still with him.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 It had been a while since she had been intimate with him. She couldn\u2019t even remember the last time, they had done it. Maybe it was the night before he had left for the tour. And it had been eight months since then.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Harry too missed the intimate moments they used to share. Yes, he did cheat on her but that was the biggest regret of his life. He still couldn\u2019t remember why he had done it, he could only remember one night he had gotten too drunk and the next day he woke up next to Caroline, a German model. And it would\u2019ve been fine then, maybe he would\u2019ve been able to blame it on the drinks maybe, and he wouldn\u2019t have hurt Y/N so bad. But, he had done it again and again and at one point it became a habit of his. But, even then Caroline could never make up for what Y/N had made him feel.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHey, baby how was your day?\u201d Harry spoke the moment he saw Y/N enter their house.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cIt was good,\u201d Y/N replied, but the way she spoke, it reveled something completely different.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYou look tired,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she replied curtly.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 From the day she had confronted him, she was nothing but cold. Harry, didn\u2019t blame her though, he <i>had</i> cheated on her, <i>for crying out loud</i>. She could be as cold and hateful she wanted to be, he just wanted to be forgiven and get back the thing they had. But, Harry didn\u2019t if that wish of his would ever come too.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cOkay, uh freshen up I\u2019ll serve the dinner,\u201d Harry forced a smile on his face.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI think I\u2019ll skip tonight,\u201d Y/N replied and went upstairs without even looking back at him. <i>It hurt Harry</i>, he was not going to lie, <i>it hurt a lot</i> but he couldn\u2019t blame anyone other than himself. And this made him realize just how much he must have hurt her.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Harry had done this a lot in those three months of their relationship. He\u2019d work \u2018til late at night and when he got to get out sooner he\u2019d hit the bar before going to Caroline.</p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 At least she wasn\u2019t going to bar and\u00a0</i><i>spending the night with some random guy.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0</i>Just the idea of her with someone else made his heart clench.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 <i>And he </i>was<i> spending the night with someone.

And she still did too, so she stayed. However, nothing was like they used to be. They held hands, they kissed, they said \u2018I love you\u2019s to each other but nothing felt same. It was just like the time Harry was cheating on her. But this time Harry wasn\u2019t the reason, this time Y/N was.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 One thing, that made Y/N still have a little respect for him was the fact that he had never touched her during those three months. It was killing her then, though. She thought he wasn\u2019t attracted to her anymore. She had somehow convinced herself she had gained weight and literally starved herself for him. She felt pathetic to think about it now. Harry hadn\u2019t touched her because he felt guilty, he felt as if he was taking advantage of her. There were many times in those three months\u00a0 Y/N had tried to make him do it, and he\u2019d give in at first but after just few minutes, he\u2019d just leave her or go to sleep saying he didn\u2019t feel good. It hurt her a lot that time, but now it was one of the reason she was still with him.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 It had been a while since she had been intimate with him. She couldn\u2019t even remember the last time, they had done it. Maybe it was the night before he had left for the tour. And it had been eight months since then.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Harry too missed the intimate moments they used to share. Yes, he did cheat on her but that was the biggest regret of his life. He still couldn\u2019t remember why he had done it, he could only remember one night he had gotten too drunk and the next day he woke up next to Caroline, a German model. And it would\u2019ve been fine then, maybe he would\u2019ve been able to blame it on the drinks maybe, and he wouldn\u2019t have hurt Y/N so bad. But, he had done it again and again and at one point it became a habit of his. But, even then Caroline could never make up for what Y/N had made him feel.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHey, baby how was your day?\u201d Harry spoke the moment he saw Y/N enter their house.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cIt was good,\u201d Y/N replied, but the way she spoke, it reveled something completely different.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYou look tired,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she replied curtly.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 From the day she had confronted him, she was nothing but cold. Harry, didn\u2019t blame her though, he <i>had</i> cheated on her, <i>for crying out loud</i>. She could be as cold and hateful she wanted to be, he just wanted to be forgiven and get back the thing they had. But, Harry didn\u2019t if that wish of his would ever come too.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cOkay, uh freshen up I\u2019ll serve the dinner,\u201d Harry forced a smile on his face.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI think I\u2019ll skip tonight,\u201d Y/N replied and went upstairs without even looking back at him. <i>It hurt Harry</i>, he was not going to lie, <i>it hurt a lot</i> but he couldn\u2019t blame anyone other than himself. And this made him realize just how much he must have hurt her.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Harry had done this a lot in those three months of their relationship. He\u2019d work \u2018til late at night and when he got to get out sooner he\u2019d hit the bar before going to Caroline.</p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 At least she wasn\u2019t going to bar and\u00a0</i><i>spending the night with some random guy.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0</i>Just the idea of her with someone else made his heart clench.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 <i>And he </i>was<i> spending the night with someone. Harry truly didn\u2019t regret something\u00a0</i><i>more than this.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 </i>Harry didn\u2019t eat that night. He packed the food in a box and shoved it into the fridge before heading upstairs. Y/n was already in her pj\u2019s and her wet hair tied up in a bun. Harry had lost count just how many times he told her it wasn\u2019t healthy for her hair or her to tie her wet hair like that, but that night Harry decided to not comment on it.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Y/N decided to ignore him and just got under the blanket and turned her back towards the spot Harry usually slept.</p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 Harry hated it. Harry hated himself. </i></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Y/N wasn\u2019t her anymore. She wasn\u2019t her around him or anyone. She used to be so happy and cheerful almost all the time. He even had a yellow heart next her nickname in his phone, because he felt the yellow color defined her better- <i>bright, happy and cheerful</i>. She didn\u2019t like the color much though. <i>She didn\u2019t like\u00a0</i><i>any vibrant color much.</i> Most of her closet comprised of black, grey and</p><p>light pink. \u00a0But, now he could easily define her with color grey, and he hated that.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Harry slowly went to their bathroom, did his night routine before going to the bed. She was still</p><p>laying the way he had left her.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Harry was getting used to this, though. Almost every night was like this, however the other</p><p>nights she\u2019d actually have dinner with him and talk a little. At first they\u2019d\n</p><p>even cuddle at night, but it was as if Y/N was slowly drifting apart.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI know you aren\u2019t sleeping,\u201d Harry said finally. He had his back rested on the headboard and eyes fixed at her back.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u2018Well, I am trying to sleep,\u201d she finally said.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s nine, babe. You never sleep this early.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Y/N didn\u2019t reply this time. Harry almost thought it was the end of the conversation but then Y/N</p><p>stirred a little before sitting up and resting her back on the headboard just\n</p><p>like Harry.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHarry, I don\u2019t think I can do this anymore,\u201d she said slowly, still not looking at Harry.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cBaby, why not?\u201d\n</p><p>he took her hand in his. \u201cI promise, I won\u2019t ever do that again. She meant nothing. I love <i>you,</i> please we\u2019ll make this</p><p>work.\u201d Harry\u2019s voice was soft but it was <i>so\u00a0</i>desperate.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI just can\u2019t,\u201d Y/N took her hand away from him. \u201cEvery time I look at you I remember you\u2019ve</p><p>been with her when I was waiting here for you. You cheated on me. It\u2019s just not\n</p><p>fair.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 She finally looked at him, reveling the watery eyes. Harry honestly didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>But, he was scared, he was so fucking scared that she\u2019d finally leave him.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 In one swift motion he threw his arms around her and pulled her as close as he could. <i>He was scared.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 </i>\u201cI know, but please Y/N we can make this work, just- we can make this work,\u201d he was crying then. \u201cI love you and we</p><p>will get through this. I know I messed up but I promise it won\u2019t happen ever\n</p><p>again.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Y/N didn\u2019t say anything for a while, but Harry could hear the soft cries she was letting out.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 It broke his heart. He never wanted to be the reason of her tears but he knew, he hurt her</p><p>in one of the worst way possible.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cPle-\u201c</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Before, Harry could start again, Y/N spoke. \u201cMake love to me.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 It took Harry a little by surprise. He let of go her a little and looked at her.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cMake love to me,Harry,\u201d she told him again.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 This time Harry didn\u2019t waste any time and crashed his lips on hers. Their lips molded into each</p><p>other\u2019s, and finally after so long Harry felt the burning passion they once\n</p><p>had. It was as strong as it used to be but it was definitely there and Harry\n</p><p>had never been this thankful.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 That night, they had taken it slow, but the passion and love they had, grew equally fast.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI love you,\u201d\n</p><p>Harry had let out the moment he came. He was crying then and so was Y/N, but\n</p><p>for some reason this time he was happy. He didn\u2019t know why but those tears- <i>it just felt right.</i></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Harry kissed her one last time and rolled over on his side, but he didn\u2019t pull himself out, it just</p><p>felt right.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Y/N didn\u2019t say anything though, but she was smiling through her tears. But, it wasn\u2019t just the</p><p>smile that told him that everything will be alright, it was the feeling. It was\n</p><p>as if there was a bubble around them, keeping them away from all the wrongs in\n</p><p>the world, all the wrongs in the past. If Harry could, he\u2019d stay like that\n</p><p>forever, with her so close and everything just right. He kissed her again, this\n</p><p>time Harry was smiling too. Harry didn\u2019t know how long they stayed like that,\n</p><p>looking at each other and smiling bright while their eyes twinkled like the\n</p><p>very first time they met when they were in kindergarten. However, Y/N hadn\u2019t yet\n</p><p>replied, there was no confirmation. But, it was as if she read his mind and\n</p><p>finally told him.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p>",
                "content": "<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It had bee over five months, maybe even more. But, Y/N didn&rsquo;t care. For some reason time had become a blur to her. She didn&rsquo;t know what she was doing, what was happening. She hated herself for still being stuck to something that happened so long ago, or maybe it happened just yesterday, at least it felt like it.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; These past few months, Y/N felt like she wasn&rsquo;t human anymore. After Y/N had found out about the other girl, she thought of leaving, she really did. She really didn&rsquo;t want to give anyone, especially her little sister the idea that it was okay if someone treated her like that. But, she couldn&rsquo;t bring herself to do it. Y/N loved him. And, he loved her, at least that what he told her.</p><p><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; I love you. </i></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Y/N and Harry had always been the lovey-dovey couple. They couldn&rsquo;t keep their hands off of each other. Even when they weren&rsquo;t officially public, there wasn&rsquo;t one picture of them walking in the London streets without their hands entangled. Y/N loved it though. It made her feel special. And after they had finally said &lsquo;I love you&rsquo; to each other, it had become like a mantra between them They hadn&rsquo;t gone one&nbsp;single day in their &nbsp;two years relationship without saying those words. Even when he went on tour they always&nbsp;texted to remind each other. But, one day it had stopped coming from him And that was the first thing that made Y/N realized maybe something was wrong, but never in hundred years she thought he&rsquo;d be unfaithful to her. At first she thought, he had forgotten and she brushed it off without even thinking about it. But, soon it wasn&rsquo;t just the &lsquo;I love you&rsquo;s that changed, their kisses, their touch, their love everything changed with time.

I wrote it based on the <a href=\"https://lyrics.az/autumn/-/perfect-two.html\">lyrics</a> as opposed to the sound of the song \u2013 I imagine Harry performing this song in the story to be a similar change from the 1D WMYB to the version he performed on tour.

        "body": "<h2><i>The journey to Uncle Max\u2019s turns out to be more hassle than you\u2019d hoped.</i><br/></h2><p><b><i>A/N: Hiii I\u2019m so sorry I sat on this for so long. I\u2019ve had a weird couple of weeks, but I am back and this is long overdue. I am not done with this series, I refuse to be because it\u2019s so much fun to write. This part is 3k! Love always, Kate xxx</i></b></p><p><b></b><i></i><b></b><i></i>\u201cCan I drive?\u201d Aoife asks with an expectant grin.</p><p>You pause and look back to her with raised brows, Harry\u2019s expression very similar to yours. Dillon is stood by the back door of the car with a bemused look on his face.</p><p>\u201cOkay, two things baby girl,\u201d you hover your hand on the passenger side door, \u201cyou haven\u2019t passed your test yet back home, and you\u2019re too young to drive in this country regardless.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>Dillon snorts and quickly slips into the back seat behind Harry. \u201cSavage!\u201d</p><p>Harry frowns at Dillon but keeps his attention on Fee. \u201cMaybe next year, eh?\u201d He sends her a little wink and a smile which seems to only make her more stroppy.</p><p>You throw an irritated glance Harry\u2019s way. \u201cDon\u2019t say that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell she might be able to!\u201d Harry retorts, throwing his hands up in defence. \u201cCome on, I want to get going before we can\u2019t get out of the city because it\u2019s too busy.\u201d He nods his head towards the car and opens his door.</p><p>Fee huffs and slides into the other backseat behind you, while you get settled into the front. \u201cI still hate this journey.\u201d You mutter under your breath.</p><p>Harry glances at you and smirks. \u201cAre we&hellip; are we having a little whinge over there, eh?\u201d He teases you with a giggle, poking your thigh as he turns the engine on.</p><p>You ignore him and fiddle around with the stereo on the dashboard. \u201cWhat are we listening to this time, kiddies?\u201d You ask, loud enough for the kids to hear in the back.</p><p>\u201cCan it not be a One Direction marathon like we did last year?\u201d Dillon grumbles.</p><p>\u201cHow rude&hellip;\u201d You mumble, glancing at Harry who\u2019s scowling over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cOi, how many times have I told you that you wouldn\u2019t be here if it weren\u2019t for that band?\u201d</p><p>You nudge for him to concentrate and frown a little. \u201cWhat, so you think that if you were never in One Direction we\u2019d never have met?\u201d Your tone holds a hint of scepticism and offence, and you decide on something harmless that no one would complain about for the time being.</p><p>\u201cWell done, Dad.\u201d Dillon mutters from behind Harry, sharing a smirk with Fee.</p><p>\u201cProbably not, no. Let\u2019s face it.\u201d Harry shrugs, seemingly confused by your new offended demeanour.</p><p>\u201cJust remember kids, your dad told me when he proposed that he\u2019d found his soulmate and we\u2019d have found each other anywhere, because we were meant to be.\u201d You angle yourself towards the middle of the car, but keep your hard gaze that matches your voice on your husband.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really cheesy.\u201d Fee cackles behind you.</p><p>\u201cCheesy or not, he\u2019s now admitted he made it up.\u201d You huff, glaring at him until he speaks again.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t make it up, I do think we\u2019re soulmates.\u201d He retorts with a crease between his brow. \u201cAnd your mum loves it when I\u2019m cheesy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how can we be soulmates if you don\u2019t think we\u2019d have found each other if you weren\u2019t in One Direction? Bare in mind we met after One Direction broke up.\u201d You asked flatly, keeping your gaze on him still.</p><p>Harry wishes he\u2019d eaten his words as he awkwardly chews on his bottom lip. \u201cI mean&hellip; do you really think we would have found each other?\u201d</p><p>Your children erupt into fitting laughter as you continue to grow more irate. Harry further regrets what he\u2019d said even more and wishes the ground would swallow him up, preferably not with the rest of the car.</p><p>\u201cDad mate, you\u2019re digging yourself an even bigger hole.\u201d Dillon cackles, reaching forward to smack his dad\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cSo really, when you said we\u2019d have found each other anywhere, you didn\u2019t actually mean it at all, it was just you being poetic?\u201d You challenge, your arms now folded across your chest. \u201cWho helped you write that, eh? Mitch? Niall? You were pretty cosy with him again when you proposed, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re being a bit dramatic&hellip;\u201d Harry lets out a long breath, still refusing to admit he was wrong.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no.\u201d You push for an answer, your voice raising in volume with each individual word. \u201cI want to know which lyricist extraordinaire helped you write the words you used to propose to me with, so I know who needs a smack the next time I see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one helped me, for crying out loud!\u201d He yells suddenly, sending you a little glare without really taking his eyes off the road. </p><p>\u201cSo you just lied then?!\u201d You shout back, though in a much higher and shrill pitch.</p><p>\u201cAre you really gonna get pissy over something I said over twenty years ago?!\u201d He asks incredulously, shifting angrily in his seat.</p><p>\u201cI am when it was a fucking proclamation of your supposed love!\u201d You all but screech, completely oblivious to the fact that you\u2019ve just sworn in front of your children for the very first time.</p><p>Fee and Dillon know you\u2019re not messing now, because they\u2019ve seen you angry before and you\u2019d still managed to keep a lid on your cursing. Harry on the other hand doesn\u2019t seem too fazed.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck do you mean, <i>\u2018supposed\u2019</i>?!\u201d He scoffs bitterly. \u201cWe\u2019ve been married twenty years, we have two children together and we still <i>do it</i> at every fucking opportunity! If I didn\u2019t love you you\u2019d bloody know about it!\u201d</p><p>~</p><p>A phone call has interrupted your uncomfortable silence. For about half and hour you\u2019ve all been sat in silence after your little spat with Harry, you glaring out the side window as Harry\u2019s knuckles grow whiter over his crushing grip on the steering wheel. Fee and Dillon have been sharing glances and bemused smirks, but refusing to say anything in case one of you tells them to shut up. You never would, neither of you. In fact you wish they would speak so that the tension isn\u2019t so obvious anymore.</p><p>It\u2019s your phone that\u2019s ringing, so you quickly answer it to stop the noise. \u201cHi Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d God he sounds more and more like your dad everyday. \u201cAre you all en route?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re um&hellip; just about to join the M4 by Heathrow.\u201d You mumble.</p><p>\u201cLovely job. I assume you\u2019ll drop your things at the flat first?\u201d</p><p>You internally cringe and take a deep breath. \u201cEr probably,\u201d you reluctantly look to Harry, \u201care we going to the flat first?\u201d</p><p>Harry glances to you with a surprised glint in his eye and nods slowly. \u201cYeah, just to drop everything off and freshen up.\u201d He\u2019s only surprised because he\u2019s normally the one who has to extend the olive branch and go in with his tail between his legs, not the other way around.</p><p>You nod once and look back out the windshield. \u201cYeah we are. So we\u2019ll probably be over around mid afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, see you then!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you later.\u201d You hum, before putting the phone down and setting it back in your lap.</p><p>It\u2019s quiet again for a moment, just the hum of the car and the <i>whoosh</i> of the other passing vehicles. You wonder if maybe you had been dramatic earlier, getting so wound up about something that deep down you probably know to be true. Hell, of course you were being dramatic, but it still got to you a little that Harry apparently felt that way. Maybe you were being unreasonable.</p><p>\u201cIs Uncle Max having a barbecue again?\u201d Fee interrupts your quiet with her soft question.</p><p>You crane your neck to limply smile at her around the head rest. \u201cI don\u2019t know, love. Probably. It\u2019s a fairly warm day so there\u2019s every possibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe Auntie Lana\u2019ll make that fancy potato salad you all loved so much.\u201d Harry adds, much to pretty much everyone\u2019s surprise.</p><p>Dillon\u2019s groan came right from his chest. \u201cOh my God, that was good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Harry chuckles. \u201cNot too much mayo, still got the skin on the potatoes,\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she put um, chicken and little bits of bacon in it too.\u201d Fee gushes, the entire car giggling at the thought of it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get arsey if she didn\u2019t make it though, just ask her for a recipe or something so we can take it home.\u201d You remind them.</p><p>\u201cMum, it\u2019s just a potato salad&hellip;\u201d Dillon chuckles with a bemused frown.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well we all know if I try and make it you\u2019ll all complain it\u2019s not the same.\u201d You grumble with a little roll of your eyes. You sound like your mother.</p><p>The car falls silent again, but seemingly more comfortably this time, regardless of your little bitter comment. It\u2019s only a brief moment before you feel Harry\u2019s hand reach across the middle partition to slip into yours, his fingers interlocking with yours, and you don\u2019t hesitate to grip his hand back.</p><p>~</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Harry mumbles under his breath, only loud enough for you to hear.</p><p>His hand, that had been clinging to yours for the past twenty minutes, finally freeing itself to start poking at things on the dashboard.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d You ask quietly, realising that he\u2019s checking through the car\u2019s readings.</p><p>\u201cNeed to pull over, something\u2019s not right.\u201d He sighs, switching from the fast lane to the outside lane in one smooth movement.</p><p>\u201cCan you manage another mile?\u201d You look up to him with a small frown. \u201cReading services is literally a minute away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t normally stop at that one, do we?\u201d Dillon asks, apparently paying more attention than you\u2019d expected him to.</p><p>\u201cNo, we usually stop at Leigh Delamere.\u201d You confirm with a sort of half smile. \u201cWe\u2019re a fair way off from there, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are we stopping? I don\u2019t like these services.\u201d Fee grumbles with a slight frown.</p><p>You and Harry share a smirk and laugh between yourselves for a second. \u201cBaby girl, you\u2019ve never been to them, how do you know you don\u2019t like them?\u201d You challenge with stifled grin.</p><p>\u201cI just know I won\u2019t.\u201d She grumbles with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cWe only stop at Leigh Delamere because you lot always want a KFC rather than a McDonald\u2019s.\u201d You remind her with a little giggle.</p><p>\u201cA tradition that you started, love.\u201d Harry nudges you.</p><p>You pause for a moment, glancing between your husband and your children before settling back into your seat. \u201cAlright, fair\u2019s fair I guess.\u201d</p><p>Your little family snigger at your surrender, and you\u2019re silently thankful that the atmosphere is a lot calmer than it was half an hour ago, and that Harry is seemingly managing to keep his cool with regards to his current car situation.</p><p>Harry pulls off into the services, parking the car in a far corner of the large car park under some trees to avoid any suspecting onlookers, a habit he\u2019d adopted way before he even met you. He used to claim it was to keep the sun off it, but in a cold winter that\u2019s a fairly poor excuse.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d You ask as he pulls the leaver by his feet to release the bonnet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I think it\u2019s the oil, but I might be wrong.\u201d He mumbles as he climbs out.</p><p>You follow behind him, the kids clambering out but keeping out of the way as the two of you asses the state of his car. You want to say it\u2019s probably to do with the fact it\u2019s been left so long without being driven, especially since Gemma normally takes it for a drive every so often while she can but maybe hasn\u2019t had a chance to recently, but for the sake of avoiding another argument you keep quiet.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take Harry long to decide that he should probably call someone out to have a look, so as he rings the AA you take your family to get something to eat. Twenty minutes later the breakdown recovery man shows up, and Harry takes Dillon along with him while you and Fee stay put to wander the few shops.</p><p>\u201cMum, can I get this?\u201d Fee interrupts your book browsing to wiggle a cheap looking plush toy in your face.</p><p>Your brows raise like a natural instinct. \u201cEr, what on Earth for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor my beanie baby collection.\u201d She answers as if your question were dumb.</p><p>\u201cBut&hellip; it\u2019s not&hellip; it\u2019s not a beanie baby, Fee.\u201d The beanie baby collection she had was actually yours, and there was no way in hell she\u2019d be getting a shit toy to add to an otherwise pristine collection.</p><p>\u201cWell&hellip; can I get it anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Fee. Put it back.\u201d You realise now that you sound like your own mother, but you ignore that thought, mentally shoving it all the way to the back of your mind and locking it up. You refuse to believe you\u2019re anything like your mother.</p><p>\u201cBoo,\u201d She scoffs, shoving the toy back into the cage she\u2019d pulled it from with a scowl, grandma would\u2019ve let me have it.\u201d</p><p>And no, she\u2019s not talking about Anne, she\u2019s talking about your mother. \u201cYeah well, Grandma\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill she be there later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if your Uncle Max has got anything to do with it.\u201d You remind her, since your brother has less of a relationship with your mum than you do, and they live twenty minutes away from each other.</p><p>~</p><p>\u201cMum, look at this.\u201d Fee giggles as she shows you her phone.</p><p>It\u2019s been an hour since Harry and Dillon went to meet the recovery bloke, and they\u2019re still with him. Both you and Fee are growing restless and irate, now sitting in a coffee shop on your second round of coffees.</p><p>You watch Fee\u2019s phone as she plays a video of Dillon from just a moment ago, half his frame on one side whilst in the background Harry stresses watching the breakdown man fiddle with his car. You shouldn\u2019t laugh, but Dillon quietly singing the words to Daughtry\u2019s Breakdown over the top of their talking makes it hard not to howl. You\u2019re not sure if Harry\u2019s noticed, but if he has he\u2019s going a fantastic job of ignoring him.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s he sent that to?\u201d You ask worriedly, still struggling to contain your smirk.</p><p>Fee shrugs with a mirrored expression. \u201cDunno, probably everyone.\u201d</p><p>You cringe lightly, but you\u2019re still unable to stop your laughter. \u201cCome on, lets get something for the drive and go.\u201d</p><p>~</p><p>Once you\u2019re back outside the breakdown man is just pulling off. You watch him drive away and then look to Harry with an expectant expression.</p><p>\u201cAll sorted?\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes and nods lightly. \u201cYeah, <i>finally</i>. Still have no idea what the actual problem was. Seems like he didn\u2019t either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh well,\u201d you stroke his arm as he leans in to kiss your cheek, \u201csorted now. We got you water and a coffee, weren\u2019t sure which one you\u2019d want.\u201d</p><p>Harry beams at you and takes the bottle and coffee from your hands. \u201cBoth at the moment.\u201d</p><p>You giggle and hurry back around to the passenger side as the rest of your family climb back into the car. Within moments you\u2019re back on the motorway while Dillon takes the lead with the music, and once again you\u2019re cackling when he plays Breakdown first through the car speakers.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"harrysimpact:84yOYP3rxnEVyXMzZRgruw:Zx9fux2Pi9cUc\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"400\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fff8db7401aef8708d5a66c76297813f/tumblr_ovtu1hWGbI1qg6jh9o1_r1_500.gif\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"400\"/></figure><p><b>~<a href=\"http://waitingfortwilight.tumblr.com/post/182919772299/a-series-of-parental-events-masterlist\">Series Masterlist~</a></b></p><p>Gracias muchachas(?)!</p><p>Tag list:\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRQvNGuL791trMASjjacTyQ\">@pxrrishly</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgPyqI5CkEId8g7xFggm2Hg\">@permanentllyharry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb5MZxMvKL3E9V-fzr16asg\">@talesofstyles</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUftrmoCR-gJ36qDkBozOAg\">@abundantlyabundant</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mC46KFufQzMQFQPY1dCvfcA\">@joan-of-disappointment</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m73AsCPI6pl5ydzYNqZA7ig\">@staceystoleyourheart</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYYD0_lJbE8J3m-qWYoZ2Ww\">@hoeforhaz</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlRbiKuRhgrY3E3H8bL5cIg\">@harry12styles94</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNcSwE3yuAMUrJFCByV9VEA\">@belikebebe</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw8YPeV1kp6lQtCreciPNCQ\">@harryismydaddy21</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGFOmVWpQgDRviVbQYGjJ8w\">@meet-me-in-the-harry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5sffYoPzjk56Rs6ZvKn9FQ\">@joycelovedorial</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp_6aoPyziVdi6ZXi6B8LjQ\">@evaolin</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmcxuUK9ZWplnHQCdhUVD1A\">@harrystyles-concepts</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfxkucLlCoWB5Gmly8d8H6Q\">@harryisalittleshit</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6jWlNWmGyQNYnEd6-SS92A\">@newtosaur250</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/myJAa8KxYrK4vh_yQTZ_60g\">@sydneys-life-blog</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZRip2ZNdgboKd6U6cXPvGA\">@flowerrrrrchilddd</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgrGBah2yj4TnFyzYRijzTQ\">@belle-ofthe-sea</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbryUSDk8hHw5rIDbYFA7aQ\">@grace-leigh</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD79q662XJ4yMKN7-cXEIJQ\">@winchesterwife27</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqFIrbUtoEAyD3S9kiL95Nw\">@gangofhoes</a></p>",

Love always, Kate xxx</i></b></p><p><b></b><i></i><b></b><i></i>\u201cCan I drive?\u201d Aoife asks with an expectant grin.</p><p>You pause and look back to her with raised brows, Harry\u2019s expression very similar to yours. Dillon is stood by the back door of the car with a bemused look on his face.</p><p>\u201cOkay, two things baby girl,\u201d you hover your hand on the passenger side door, \u201cyou haven\u2019t passed your test yet back home, and you\u2019re too young to drive in this country regardless.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Dillon snorts and quickly slips into the back seat behind Harry. \u201cSavage!\u201d</p><p>Harry frowns at Dillon but keeps his attention on Fee. \u201cMaybe next year, eh?\u201d He sends her a little wink and a smile which seems to only make her more stroppy.</p><p>You throw an irritated glance Harry\u2019s way. \u201cDon\u2019t say that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell she might be able to!\u201d Harry retorts, throwing his hands up in defence. \u201cCome on, I want to get going before we can\u2019t get out of the city because it\u2019s too busy.\u201d He nods his head towards the car and opens his door.</p><p>Fee huffs and slides into the other backseat behind you, while you get settled into the front. \u201cI still hate this journey.\u201d You mutter under your breath.</p><p>Harry glances at you and smirks. \u201cAre we\u2026 are we having a little whinge over there, eh?\u201d He teases you with a giggle, poking your thigh as he turns the engine on.</p><p>You ignore him and fiddle around with the stereo on the dashboard. \u201cWhat are we listening to this time, kiddies?\u201d You ask, loud enough for the kids to hear in the back.</p><p>\u201cCan it not be a One Direction marathon like we did last year?\u201d Dillon grumbles.</p><p>\u201cHow rude\u2026\u201d You mumble, glancing at Harry who\u2019s scowling over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cOi, how many times have I told you that you wouldn\u2019t be here if it weren\u2019t for that band?\u201d</p><p>You nudge for him to concentrate and frown a little. \u201cWhat, so you think that if you were never in One Direction we\u2019d never have met?\u201d Your tone holds a hint of scepticism and offence, and you decide on something harmless that no one would complain about for the time being.</p><p>\u201cWell done, Dad.\u201d Dillon mutters from behind Harry, sharing a smirk with Fee.</p><p>\u201cProbably not, no. Let\u2019s face it.\u201d Harry shrugs, seemingly confused by your new offended demeanour.</p><p>\u201cJust remember kids, your dad told me when he proposed that he\u2019d found his soulmate and we\u2019d have found each other anywhere, because we were meant to be.\u201d You angle yourself towards the middle of the car, but keep your hard gaze that matches your voice on your husband.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really cheesy.\u201d Fee cackles behind you.</p><p>\u201cCheesy or not, he\u2019s now admitted he made it up.\u201d You huff, glaring at him until he speaks again.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t make it up, I do think we\u2019re soulmates.\u201d He retorts with a crease between his brow. \u201cAnd your mum loves it when I\u2019m cheesy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how can we be soulmates if you don\u2019t think we\u2019d have found each other if you weren\u2019t in One Direction? Bare in mind we met after One Direction broke up.\u201d You asked flatly, keeping your gaze on him still.</p><p>Harry wishes he\u2019d eaten his words as he awkwardly chews on his bottom lip. \u201cI mean\u2026 do you really think we would have found each other?\u201d</p><p>Your children erupt into fitting laughter as you continue to grow more irate. Harry further regrets what he\u2019d said even more and wishes the ground would swallow him up, preferably not with the rest of the car.</p><p>\u201cDad mate, you\u2019re digging yourself an even bigger hole.\u201d Dillon cackles, reaching forward to smack his dad\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cSo really, when you said we\u2019d have found each other anywhere, you didn\u2019t actually mean it at all, it was just you being poetic?\u201d You challenge, your arms now folded across your chest. \u201cWho helped you write that, eh? Mitch? Niall? You were pretty cosy with him again when you proposed, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re being a bit dramatic\u2026\u201d Harry lets out a long breath, still refusing to admit he was wrong.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no.\u201d You push for an answer, your voice raising in volume with each individual word. \u201cI want to know which lyricist extraordinaire helped you write the words you used to propose to me with, so I know who needs a smack the next time I see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one helped me, for crying out loud!\u201d He yells suddenly, sending you a little glare without really taking his eyes off the road. </p><p>\u201cSo you just lied then?!\u201d You shout back, though in a much higher and shrill pitch.</p><p>\u201cAre you really gonna get pissy over something I said over twenty years ago?!\u201d He asks incredulously, shifting angrily in his seat.</p><p>\u201cI am when it was a fucking proclamation of your supposed love!\u201d You all but screech, completely oblivious to the fact that you\u2019ve just sworn in front of your children for the very first time.</p><p>Fee and Dillon know you\u2019re not messing now, because they\u2019ve seen you angry before and you\u2019d still managed to keep a lid on your cursing. Harry on the other hand doesn\u2019t seem too fazed.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck do you mean, <i>\u2018supposed\u2019</i>?!\u201d He scoffs bitterly. \u201cWe\u2019ve been married twenty years, we have two children together and we still <i>do it</i> at every fucking opportunity! If I didn\u2019t love you you\u2019d bloody know about it!\u201d</p><p>~</p><p>A phone call has interrupted your uncomfortable silence. For about half and hour you\u2019ve all been sat in silence after your little spat with Harry, you glaring out the side window as Harry\u2019s knuckles grow whiter over his crushing grip on the steering wheel. Fee and Dillon have been sharing glances and bemused smirks, but refusing to say anything in case one of you tells them to shut up. You never would, neither of you. In fact you wish they would speak so that the tension isn\u2019t so obvious anymore.</p><p>It\u2019s your phone that\u2019s ringing, so you quickly answer it to stop the noise. \u201cHi Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d God he sounds more and more like your dad everyday. \u201cAre you all en route?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re um\u2026 just about to join the M4 by Heathrow.\u201d You mumble.</p><p>\u201cLovely job. I assume you\u2019ll drop your things at the flat first?\u201d</p><p>You internally cringe and take a deep breath. \u201cEr probably,\u201d you reluctantly look to Harry, \u201care we going to the flat first?\u201d</p><p>Harry glances to you with a surprised glint in his eye and nods slowly. \u201cYeah, just to drop everything off and freshen up.\u201d He\u2019s only surprised because he\u2019s normally the one who has to extend the olive branch and go in with his tail between his legs, not the other way around.</p><p>You nod once and look back out the windshield. \u201cYeah we are. So we\u2019ll probably be over around mid afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, see you then!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you later.\u201d You hum, before putting the phone down and setting it back in your lap.</p><p>It\u2019s quiet again for a moment, just the hum of the car and the <i>whoosh</i> of the other passing vehicles. You wonder if maybe you had been dramatic earlier, getting so wound up about something that deep down you probably know to be true. Hell, of course you were being dramatic, but it still got to you a little that Harry apparently felt that way. Maybe you were being unreasonable.</p><p>\u201cIs Uncle Max having a barbecue again?\u201d Fee interrupts your quiet with her soft question.</p><p>You crane your neck to limply smile at her around the head rest. \u201cI don\u2019t know, love. Probably. It\u2019s a fairly warm day so there\u2019s every possibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe Auntie Lana\u2019ll make that fancy potato salad you all loved so much.\u201d Harry adds, much to pretty much everyone\u2019s surprise.</p><p>Dillon\u2019s groan came right from his chest. \u201cOh my God, that was good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Harry chuckles. \u201cNot too much mayo, still got the skin on the potatoes,\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she put um, chicken and little bits of bacon in it too.\u201d Fee gushes, the entire car giggling at the thought of it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get arsey if she didn\u2019t make it though, just ask her for a recipe or something so we can take it home.\u201d You remind them.</p><p>\u201cMum, it\u2019s just a potato salad\u2026\u201d Dillon chuckles with a bemused frown.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well we all know if I try and make it you\u2019ll all complain it\u2019s not the same.\u201d You grumble with a little roll of your eyes. You sound like your mother.</p><p>The car falls silent again, but seemingly more comfortably this time, regardless of your little bitter comment. It\u2019s only a brief moment before you feel Harry\u2019s hand reach across the middle partition to slip into yours, his fingers interlocking with yours, and you don\u2019t hesitate to grip his hand back.</p><p>~</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Harry mumbles under his breath, only loud enough for you to hear.</p><p>His hand, that had been clinging to yours for the past twenty minutes, finally freeing itself to start poking at things on the dashboard.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d You ask quietly, realising that he\u2019s checking through the car\u2019s readings.</p><p>\u201cNeed to pull over, something\u2019s not right.\u201d He sighs, switching from the fast lane to the outside lane in one smooth movement.</p><p>\u201cCan you manage another mile?\u201d You look up to him with a small frown. \u201cReading services is literally a minute away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t normally stop at that one, do we?\u201d Dillon asks, apparently paying more attention than you\u2019d expected him to.</p><p>\u201cNo, we usually stop at Leigh Delamere.\u201d You confirm with a sort of half smile. \u201cWe\u2019re a fair way off from there, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are we stopping? I don\u2019t like these services.\u201d Fee grumbles with a slight frown.</p><p>You and Harry share a smirk and laugh between yourselves for a second. \u201cBaby girl, you\u2019ve never been to them, how do you know you don\u2019t like them?\u201d You challenge with stifled grin.</p><p>\u201cI just know I won\u2019t.\u201d She grumbles with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cWe only stop at Leigh Delamere because you lot always want a KFC rather than a McDonald\u2019s.\u201d You remind her with a little giggle.</p><p>\u201cA tradition that you started, love.\u201d Harry nudges you.</p><p>You pause for a moment, glancing between your husband and your children before settling back into your seat. \u201cAlright, fair\u2019s fair I guess.\u201d</p><p>Your little family snigger at your surrender, and you\u2019re silently thankful that the atmosphere is a lot calmer than it was half an hour ago, and that Harry is seemingly managing to keep his cool with regards to his current car situation.</p><p>Harry pulls off into the services, parking the car in a far corner of the large car park under some trees to avoid any suspecting onlookers, a habit he\u2019d adopted way before he even met you. He used to claim it was to keep the sun off it, but in a cold winter that\u2019s a fairly poor excuse.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d You ask as he pulls the leaver by his feet to release the bonnet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I think it\u2019s the oil, but I might be wrong.\u201d He mumbles as he climbs out.</p><p>You follow behind him, the kids clambering out but keeping out of the way as the two of you asses the state of his car. You want to say it\u2019s probably to do with the fact it\u2019s been left so long without being driven, especially since Gemma normally takes it for a drive every so often while she can but maybe hasn\u2019t had a chance to recently, but for the sake of avoiding another argument you keep quiet.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take Harry long to decide that he should probably call someone out to have a look, so as he rings the AA you take your family to get something to eat. Twenty minutes later the breakdown recovery man shows up, and Harry takes Dillon along with him while you and Fee stay put to wander the few shops.</p><p>\u201cMum, can I get this?\u201d Fee interrupts your book browsing to wiggle a cheap looking plush toy in your face.</p><p>Your brows raise like a natural instinct. \u201cEr, what on Earth for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor my beanie baby collection.\u201d She answers as if your question were dumb.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2026 it\u2019s not\u2026 it\u2019s not a beanie baby, Fee.\u201d The beanie baby collection she had was actually yours, and there was no way in hell she\u2019d be getting a shit toy to add to an otherwise pristine collection.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 can I get it anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Fee. Put it back.\u201d You realise now that you sound like your own mother, but you ignore that thought, mentally shoving it all the way to the back of your mind and locking it up. You refuse to believe you\u2019re anything like your mother.</p><p>\u201cBoo,\u201d She scoffs, shoving the toy back into the cage she\u2019d pulled it from with a scowl, grandma would\u2019ve let me have it.\u201d</p><p>And no, she\u2019s not talking about Anne, she\u2019s talking about your mother. \u201cYeah well, Grandma\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill she be there later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if your Uncle Max has got anything to do with it.\u201d You remind her, since your brother has less of a relationship with your mum than you do, and they live twenty minutes away from each other.</p><p>~</p><p>\u201cMum, look at this.\u201d Fee giggles as she shows you her phone.</p><p>It\u2019s been an hour since Harry and Dillon went to meet the recovery bloke, and they\u2019re still with him. Both you and Fee are growing restless and irate, now sitting in a coffee shop on your second round of coffees.</p><p>You watch Fee\u2019s phone as she plays a video of Dillon from just a moment ago, half his frame on one side whilst in the background Harry stresses watching the breakdown man fiddle with his car. You shouldn\u2019t laugh, but Dillon quietly singing the words to Daughtry\u2019s Breakdown over the top of their talking makes it hard not to howl. You\u2019re not sure if Harry\u2019s noticed, but if he has he\u2019s going a fantastic job of ignoring him.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s he sent that to?\u201d You ask worriedly, still struggling to contain your smirk.</p><p>Fee shrugs with a mirrored expression. \u201cDunno, probably everyone.\u201d</p><p>You cringe lightly, but you\u2019re still unable to stop your laughter. \u201cCome on, lets get something for the drive and go.\u201d</p><p>~</p><p>Once you\u2019re back outside the breakdown man is just pulling off. You watch him drive away and then look to Harry with an expectant expression.</p><p>\u201cAll sorted?\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes and nods lightly. \u201cYeah, <i>finally</i>. Still have no idea what the actual problem was. Seems like he didn\u2019t either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh well,\u201d you stroke his arm as he leans in to kiss your cheek, \u201csorted now. We got you water and a coffee, weren\u2019t sure which one you\u2019d want.\u201d</p><p>Harry beams at you and takes the bottle and coffee from your hands. \u201cBoth at the moment.\u201d</p><p>You giggle and hurry back around to the passenger side as the rest of your family climb back into the car.

I\u2019ve had a weird couple of weeks, but I am back and this is long overdue. I am not done with this series, I refuse to be because it\u2019s so much fun to write. This part is 3k! Love always, Kate xxx</i></b></p><p><b></b><i></i><b></b><i></i>\u201cCan I drive?\u201d Aoife asks with an expectant grin.</p><p>You pause and look back to her with raised brows, Harry\u2019s expression very similar to yours. Dillon is stood by the back door of the car with a bemused look on his face.</p><p>\u201cOkay, two things baby girl,\u201d you hover your hand on the passenger side door, \u201cyou haven\u2019t passed your test yet back home, and you\u2019re too young to drive in this country regardless.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Dillon snorts and quickly slips into the back seat behind Harry. \u201cSavage!\u201d</p><p>Harry frowns at Dillon but keeps his attention on Fee. \u201cMaybe next year, eh?\u201d He sends her a little wink and a smile which seems to only make her more stroppy.</p><p>You throw an irritated glance Harry\u2019s way. \u201cDon\u2019t say that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell she might be able to!\u201d Harry retorts, throwing his hands up in defence. \u201cCome on, I want to get going before we can\u2019t get out of the city because it\u2019s too busy.\u201d He nods his head towards the car and opens his door.</p><p>Fee huffs and slides into the other backseat behind you, while you get settled into the front. \u201cI still hate this journey.\u201d You mutter under your breath.</p><p>Harry glances at you and smirks. \u201cAre we\u2026 are we having a little whinge over there, eh?\u201d He teases you with a giggle, poking your thigh as he turns the engine on.</p><p>You ignore him and fiddle around with the stereo on the dashboard. \u201cWhat are we listening to this time, kiddies?\u201d You ask, loud enough for the kids to hear in the back.</p><p>\u201cCan it not be a One Direction marathon like we did last year?\u201d Dillon grumbles.</p><p>\u201cHow rude\u2026\u201d You mumble, glancing at Harry who\u2019s scowling over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cOi, how many times have I told you that you wouldn\u2019t be here if it weren\u2019t for that band?\u201d</p><p>You nudge for him to concentrate and frown a little. \u201cWhat, so you think that if you were never in One Direction we\u2019d never have met?\u201d Your tone holds a hint of scepticism and offence, and you decide on something harmless that no one would complain about for the time being.</p><p>\u201cWell done, Dad.\u201d Dillon mutters from behind Harry, sharing a smirk with Fee.</p><p>\u201cProbably not, no. Let\u2019s face it.\u201d Harry shrugs, seemingly confused by your new offended demeanour.</p><p>\u201cJust remember kids, your dad told me when he proposed that he\u2019d found his soulmate and we\u2019d have found each other anywhere, because we were meant to be.\u201d You angle yourself towards the middle of the car, but keep your hard gaze that matches your voice on your husband.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really cheesy.\u201d Fee cackles behind you.</p><p>\u201cCheesy or not, he\u2019s now admitted he made it up.\u201d You huff, glaring at him until he speaks again.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t make it up, I do think we\u2019re soulmates.\u201d He retorts with a crease between his brow. \u201cAnd your mum loves it when I\u2019m cheesy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how can we be soulmates if you don\u2019t think we\u2019d have found each other if you weren\u2019t in One Direction? Bare in mind we met after One Direction broke up.\u201d You asked flatly, keeping your gaze on him still.</p><p>Harry wishes he\u2019d eaten his words as he awkwardly chews on his bottom lip. \u201cI mean\u2026 do you really think we would have found each other?\u201d</p><p>Your children erupt into fitting laughter as you continue to grow more irate. Harry further regrets what he\u2019d said even more and wishes the ground would swallow him up, preferably not with the rest of the car.</p><p>\u201cDad mate, you\u2019re digging yourself an even bigger hole.\u201d Dillon cackles, reaching forward to smack his dad\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cSo really, when you said we\u2019d have found each other anywhere, you didn\u2019t actually mean it at all, it was just you being poetic?\u201d You challenge, your arms now folded across your chest. \u201cWho helped you write that, eh? Mitch? Niall? You were pretty cosy with him again when you proposed, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re being a bit dramatic\u2026\u201d Harry lets out a long breath, still refusing to admit he was wrong.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no.\u201d You push for an answer, your voice raising in volume with each individual word. \u201cI want to know which lyricist extraordinaire helped you write the words you used to propose to me with, so I know who needs a smack the next time I see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one helped me, for crying out loud!\u201d He yells suddenly, sending you a little glare without really taking his eyes off the road. </p><p>\u201cSo you just lied then?!\u201d You shout back, though in a much higher and shrill pitch.</p><p>\u201cAre you really gonna get pissy over something I said over twenty years ago?!\u201d He asks incredulously, shifting angrily in his seat.</p><p>\u201cI am when it was a fucking proclamation of your supposed love!\u201d You all but screech, completely oblivious to the fact that you\u2019ve just sworn in front of your children for the very first time.</p><p>Fee and Dillon know you\u2019re not messing now, because they\u2019ve seen you angry before and you\u2019d still managed to keep a lid on your cursing. Harry on the other hand doesn\u2019t seem too fazed.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck do you mean, <i>\u2018supposed\u2019</i>?!\u201d He scoffs bitterly. \u201cWe\u2019ve been married twenty years, we have two children together and we still <i>do it</i> at every fucking opportunity! If I didn\u2019t love you you\u2019d bloody know about it!\u201d</p><p>~</p><p>A phone call has interrupted your uncomfortable silence. For about half and hour you\u2019ve all been sat in silence after your little spat with Harry, you glaring out the side window as Harry\u2019s knuckles grow whiter over his crushing grip on the steering wheel. Fee and Dillon have been sharing glances and bemused smirks, but refusing to say anything in case one of you tells them to shut up. You never would, neither of you. In fact you wish they would speak so that the tension isn\u2019t so obvious anymore.</p><p>It\u2019s your phone that\u2019s ringing, so you quickly answer it to stop the noise. \u201cHi Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d God he sounds more and more like your dad everyday. \u201cAre you all en route?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re um\u2026 just about to join the M4 by Heathrow.\u201d You mumble.</p><p>\u201cLovely job. I assume you\u2019ll drop your things at the flat first?\u201d</p><p>You internally cringe and take a deep breath. \u201cEr probably,\u201d you reluctantly look to Harry, \u201care we going to the flat first?\u201d</p><p>Harry glances to you with a surprised glint in his eye and nods slowly. \u201cYeah, just to drop everything off and freshen up.\u201d He\u2019s only surprised because he\u2019s normally the one who has to extend the olive branch and go in with his tail between his legs, not the other way around.</p><p>You nod once and look back out the windshield. \u201cYeah we are. So we\u2019ll probably be over around mid afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, see you then!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you later.\u201d You hum, before putting the phone down and setting it back in your lap.</p><p>It\u2019s quiet again for a moment, just the hum of the car and the <i>whoosh</i> of the other passing vehicles. You wonder if maybe you had been dramatic earlier, getting so wound up about something that deep down you probably know to be true. Hell, of course you were being dramatic, but it still got to you a little that Harry apparently felt that way. Maybe you were being unreasonable.</p><p>\u201cIs Uncle Max having a barbecue again?\u201d Fee interrupts your quiet with her soft question.</p><p>You crane your neck to limply smile at her around the head rest. \u201cI don\u2019t know, love. Probably. It\u2019s a fairly warm day so there\u2019s every possibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe Auntie Lana\u2019ll make that fancy potato salad you all loved so much.\u201d Harry adds, much to pretty much everyone\u2019s surprise.</p><p>Dillon\u2019s groan came right from his chest. \u201cOh my God, that was good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Harry chuckles. \u201cNot too much mayo, still got the skin on the potatoes,\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she put um, chicken and little bits of bacon in it too.\u201d Fee gushes, the entire car giggling at the thought of it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get arsey if she didn\u2019t make it though, just ask her for a recipe or something so we can take it home.\u201d You remind them.</p><p>\u201cMum, it\u2019s just a potato salad\u2026\u201d Dillon chuckles with a bemused frown.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well we all know if I try and make it you\u2019ll all complain it\u2019s not the same.\u201d You grumble with a little roll of your eyes. You sound like your mother.</p><p>The car falls silent again, but seemingly more comfortably this time, regardless of your little bitter comment. It\u2019s only a brief moment before you feel Harry\u2019s hand reach across the middle partition to slip into yours, his fingers interlocking with yours, and you don\u2019t hesitate to grip his hand back.</p><p>~</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Harry mumbles under his breath, only loud enough for you to hear.</p><p>His hand, that had been clinging to yours for the past twenty minutes, finally freeing itself to start poking at things on the dashboard.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d You ask quietly, realising that he\u2019s checking through the car\u2019s readings.</p><p>\u201cNeed to pull over, something\u2019s not right.\u201d He sighs, switching from the fast lane to the outside lane in one smooth movement.</p><p>\u201cCan you manage another mile?\u201d You look up to him with a small frown. \u201cReading services is literally a minute away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t normally stop at that one, do we?\u201d Dillon asks, apparently paying more attention than you\u2019d expected him to.</p><p>\u201cNo, we usually stop at Leigh Delamere.\u201d You confirm with a sort of half smile. \u201cWe\u2019re a fair way off from there, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are we stopping? I don\u2019t like these services.\u201d Fee grumbles with a slight frown.</p><p>You and Harry share a smirk and laugh between yourselves for a second. \u201cBaby girl, you\u2019ve never been to them, how do you know you don\u2019t like them?\u201d You challenge with stifled grin.</p><p>\u201cI just know I won\u2019t.\u201d She grumbles with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cWe only stop at Leigh Delamere because you lot always want a KFC rather than a McDonald\u2019s.\u201d You remind her with a little giggle.</p><p>\u201cA tradition that you started, love.\u201d Harry nudges you.</p><p>You pause for a moment, glancing between your husband and your children before settling back into your seat. \u201cAlright, fair\u2019s fair I guess.\u201d</p><p>Your little family snigger at your surrender, and you\u2019re silently thankful that the atmosphere is a lot calmer than it was half an hour ago, and that Harry is seemingly managing to keep his cool with regards to his current car situation.</p><p>Harry pulls off into the services, parking the car in a far corner of the large car park under some trees to avoid any suspecting onlookers, a habit he\u2019d adopted way before he even met you. He used to claim it was to keep the sun off it, but in a cold winter that\u2019s a fairly poor excuse.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d You ask as he pulls the leaver by his feet to release the bonnet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I think it\u2019s the oil, but I might be wrong.\u201d He mumbles as he climbs out.</p><p>You follow behind him, the kids clambering out but keeping out of the way as the two of you asses the state of his car. You want to say it\u2019s probably to do with the fact it\u2019s been left so long without being driven, especially since Gemma normally takes it for a drive every so often while she can but maybe hasn\u2019t had a chance to recently, but for the sake of avoiding another argument you keep quiet.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take Harry long to decide that he should probably call someone out to have a look, so as he rings the AA you take your family to get something to eat. Twenty minutes later the breakdown recovery man shows up, and Harry takes Dillon along with him while you and Fee stay put to wander the few shops.</p><p>\u201cMum, can I get this?\u201d Fee interrupts your book browsing to wiggle a cheap looking plush toy in your face.</p><p>Your brows raise like a natural instinct. \u201cEr, what on Earth for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor my beanie baby collection.\u201d She answers as if your question were dumb.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2026 it\u2019s not\u2026 it\u2019s not a beanie baby, Fee.\u201d The beanie baby collection she had was actually yours, and there was no way in hell she\u2019d be getting a shit toy to add to an otherwise pristine collection.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 can I get it anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Fee. Put it back.\u201d You realise now that you sound like your own mother, but you ignore that thought, mentally shoving it all the way to the back of your mind and locking it up. You refuse to believe you\u2019re anything like your mother.</p><p>\u201cBoo,\u201d She scoffs, shoving the toy back into the cage she\u2019d pulled it from with a scowl, grandma would\u2019ve let me have it.\u201d</p><p>And no, she\u2019s not talking about Anne, she\u2019s talking about your mother. \u201cYeah well, Grandma\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill she be there later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if your Uncle Max has got anything to do with it.\u201d You remind her, since your brother has less of a relationship with your mum than you do, and they live twenty minutes away from each other.</p><p>~</p><p>\u201cMum, look at this.\u201d Fee giggles as she shows you her phone.</p><p>It\u2019s been an hour since Harry and Dillon went to meet the recovery bloke, and they\u2019re still with him. Both you and Fee are growing restless and irate, now sitting in a coffee shop on your second round of coffees.</p><p>You watch Fee\u2019s phone as she plays a video of Dillon from just a moment ago, half his frame on one side whilst in the background Harry stresses watching the breakdown man fiddle with his car. You shouldn\u2019t laugh, but Dillon quietly singing the words to Daughtry\u2019s Breakdown over the top of their talking makes it hard not to howl. You\u2019re not sure if Harry\u2019s noticed, but if he has he\u2019s going a fantastic job of ignoring him.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s he sent that to?\u201d You ask worriedly, still struggling to contain your smirk.</p><p>Fee shrugs with a mirrored expression. \u201cDunno, probably everyone.\u201d</p><p>You cringe lightly, but you\u2019re still unable to stop your laughter. \u201cCome on, lets get something for the drive and go.\u201d</p><p>~</p><p>Once you\u2019re back outside the breakdown man is just pulling off. You watch him drive away and then look to Harry with an expectant expression.</p><p>\u201cAll sorted?\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes and nods lightly. \u201cYeah, <i>finally</i>.

Love always, Kate xxx</i></b></p><p><b></b><i></i><b></b><i></i>&ldquo;Can I drive?&rdquo; Aoife asks with an expectant grin.</p><p>You pause and look back to her with raised brows, Harry&rsquo;s expression very similar to yours. Dillon is stood by the back door of the car with a bemused look on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, two things baby girl,&rdquo; you hover your hand on the passenger side door, &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t passed your test yet back home, and you&rsquo;re too young to drive in this country regardless.&rdquo;</p><p>Dillon snorts and quickly slips into the back seat behind Harry. &ldquo;Savage!&rdquo;</p><p>Harry frowns at Dillon but keeps his attention on Fee. &ldquo;Maybe next year, eh?&rdquo; He sends her a little wink and a smile which seems to only make her more stroppy.</p><p>You throw an irritated glance Harry&rsquo;s way. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well she might be able to!&rdquo; Harry retorts, throwing his hands up in defence. &ldquo;Come on, I want to get going before we can&rsquo;t get out of the city because it&rsquo;s too busy.&rdquo; He nods his head towards the car and opens his door.</p><p>Fee huffs and slides into the other backseat behind you, while you get settled into the front. &ldquo;I still hate this journey.&rdquo; You mutter under your breath.</p><p>Harry glances at you and smirks. &ldquo;Are we&hellip; are we having a little whinge over there, eh?&rdquo; He teases you with a giggle, poking your thigh as he turns the engine on.</p><p>You ignore him and fiddle around with the stereo on the dashboard. &ldquo;What are we listening to this time, kiddies?&rdquo; You ask, loud enough for the kids to hear in the back.</p><p>&ldquo;Can it not be a One Direction marathon like we did last year?&rdquo; Dillon grumbles.</p><p>&ldquo;How rude&hellip;&rdquo; You mumble, glancing at Harry who&rsquo;s scowling over his shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Oi, how many times have I told you that you wouldn&rsquo;t be here if it weren&rsquo;t for that band?&rdquo;</p><p>You nudge for him to concentrate and frown a little. &ldquo;What, so you think that if you were never in One Direction we&rsquo;d never have met?&rdquo; Your tone holds a hint of scepticism and offence, and you decide on something harmless that no one would complain about for the time being.</p><p>&ldquo;Well done, Dad.&rdquo; Dillon mutters from behind Harry, sharing a smirk with Fee.</p><p>&ldquo;Probably not, no. Let&rsquo;s face it.&rdquo; Harry shrugs, seemingly confused by your new offended demeanour.</p><p>&ldquo;Just remember kids, your dad told me when he proposed that he&rsquo;d found his soulmate and we&rsquo;d have found each other anywhere, because we were meant to be.&rdquo; You angle yourself towards the middle of the car, but keep your hard gaze that matches your voice on your husband.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s really cheesy.&rdquo; Fee cackles behind you.</p><p>&ldquo;Cheesy or not, he&rsquo;s now admitted he made it up.&rdquo; You huff, glaring at him until he speaks again.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t make it up, I do think we&rsquo;re soulmates.&rdquo; He retorts with a crease between his brow. &ldquo;And your mum loves it when I&rsquo;m cheesy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So how can we be soulmates if you don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d have found each other if you weren&rsquo;t in One Direction? Bare in mind we met after One Direction broke up.&rdquo; You asked flatly, keeping your gaze on him still.</p><p>Harry wishes he&rsquo;d eaten his words as he awkwardly chews on his bottom lip. &ldquo;I mean&hellip; do you really think we would have found each other?&rdquo;</p><p>Your children erupt into fitting laughter as you continue to grow more irate. Harry further regrets what he&rsquo;d said even more and wishes the ground would swallow him up, preferably not with the rest of the car.</p><p>&ldquo;Dad mate, you&rsquo;re digging yourself an even bigger hole.&rdquo; Dillon cackles, reaching forward to smack his dad&rsquo;s arm.</p><p>&ldquo;So really, when you said we&rsquo;d have found each other anywhere, you didn&rsquo;t actually mean it at all, it was just you being poetic?&rdquo; You challenge, your arms now folded across your chest. &ldquo;Who helped you write that, eh? Mitch? Niall? You were pretty cosy with him again when you proposed, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re being a bit dramatic&hellip;&rdquo; Harry lets out a long breath, still refusing to admit he was wrong.</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, no.&rdquo; You push for an answer, your voice raising in volume with each individual word. &ldquo;I want to know which lyricist extraordinaire helped you write the words you used to propose to me with, so I know who needs a smack the next time I see them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No one helped me, for crying out loud!&rdquo; He yells suddenly, sending you a little glare without really taking his eyes off the road. </p><p>&ldquo;So you just lied then?!&rdquo; You shout back, though in a much higher and shrill pitch.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you really gonna get pissy over something I said over twenty years ago?!&rdquo; He asks incredulously, shifting angrily in his seat.</p><p>&ldquo;I am when it was a fucking proclamation of your supposed love!&rdquo; You all but screech, completely oblivious to the fact that you&rsquo;ve just sworn in front of your children for the very first time.</p><p>Fee and Dillon know you&rsquo;re not messing now, because they&rsquo;ve seen you angry before and you&rsquo;d still managed to keep a lid on your cursing. Harry on the other hand doesn&rsquo;t seem too fazed.</p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck do you mean, <i>&lsquo;supposed&rsquo;</i>?!&rdquo; He scoffs bitterly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been married twenty years, we have two children together and we still <i>do it</i> at every fucking opportunity! If I didn&rsquo;t love you you&rsquo;d bloody know about it!&rdquo;</p><p>~</p><p>A phone call has interrupted your uncomfortable silence. For about half and hour you&rsquo;ve all been sat in silence after your little spat with Harry, you glaring out the side window as Harry&rsquo;s knuckles grow whiter over his crushing grip on the steering wheel. Fee and Dillon have been sharing glances and bemused smirks, but refusing to say anything in case one of you tells them to shut up. You never would, neither of you. In fact you wish they would speak so that the tension isn&rsquo;t so obvious anymore.</p><p>It&rsquo;s your phone that&rsquo;s ringing, so you quickly answer it to stop the noise. &ldquo;Hi Max.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; God he sounds more and more like your dad everyday. &ldquo;Are you all en route?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, we&rsquo;re um&hellip; just about to join the M4 by Heathrow.&rdquo; You mumble.</p><p>&ldquo;Lovely job. I assume you&rsquo;ll drop your things at the flat first?&rdquo;</p><p>You internally cringe and take a deep breath. &ldquo;Er probably,&rdquo; you reluctantly look to Harry, &ldquo;are we going to the flat first?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry glances to you with a surprised glint in his eye and nods slowly. &ldquo;Yeah, just to drop everything off and freshen up.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s only surprised because he&rsquo;s normally the one who has to extend the olive branch and go in with his tail between his legs, not the other way around.</p><p>You nod once and look back out the windshield. &ldquo;Yeah we are. So we&rsquo;ll probably be over around mid afternoon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, see you then!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;See you later.&rdquo; You hum, before putting the phone down and setting it back in your lap.</p><p>It&rsquo;s quiet again for a moment, just the hum of the car and the <i>whoosh</i> of the other passing vehicles. You wonder if maybe you had been dramatic earlier, getting so wound up about something that deep down you probably know to be true. Hell, of course you were being dramatic, but it still got to you a little that Harry apparently felt that way. Maybe you were being unreasonable.</p><p>&ldquo;Is Uncle Max having a barbecue again?&rdquo; Fee interrupts your quiet with her soft question.</p><p>You crane your neck to limply smile at her around the head rest. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, love. Probably. It&rsquo;s a fairly warm day so there&rsquo;s every possibility.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe Auntie Lana&rsquo;ll make that fancy potato salad you all loved so much.&rdquo; Harry adds, much to pretty much everyone&rsquo;s surprise.</p><p>Dillon&rsquo;s groan came right from his chest. &ldquo;Oh my God, that was good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Harry chuckles. &ldquo;Not too much mayo, still got the skin on the potatoes,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And she put um, chicken and little bits of bacon in it too.&rdquo; Fee gushes, the entire car giggling at the thought of it.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get arsey if she didn&rsquo;t make it though, just ask her for a recipe or something so we can take it home.&rdquo; You remind them.</p><p>&ldquo;Mum, it&rsquo;s just a potato salad&hellip;&rdquo; Dillon chuckles with a bemused frown.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, well we all know if I try and make it you&rsquo;ll all complain it&rsquo;s not the same.&rdquo; You grumble with a little roll of your eyes. You sound like your mother.</p><p>The car falls silent again, but seemingly more comfortably this time, regardless of your little bitter comment. It&rsquo;s only a brief moment before you feel Harry&rsquo;s hand reach across the middle partition to slip into yours, his fingers interlocking with yours, and you don&rsquo;t hesitate to grip his hand back.</p><p>~</p><p>&ldquo;Shit.&rdquo; Harry mumbles under his breath, only loud enough for you to hear.</p><p>His hand, that had been clinging to yours for the past twenty minutes, finally freeing itself to start poking at things on the dashboard.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; You ask quietly, realising that he&rsquo;s checking through the car&rsquo;s readings.</p><p>&ldquo;Need to pull over, something&rsquo;s not right.&rdquo; He sighs, switching from the fast lane to the outside lane in one smooth movement.</p><p>&ldquo;Can you manage another mile?&rdquo; You look up to him with a small frown. &ldquo;Reading services is literally a minute away.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t normally stop at that one, do we?&rdquo; Dillon asks, apparently paying more attention than you&rsquo;d expected him to.</p><p>&ldquo;No, we usually stop at Leigh Delamere.&rdquo; You confirm with a sort of half smile. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a fair way off from there, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why are we stopping? I don&rsquo;t like these services.&rdquo; Fee grumbles with a slight frown.</p><p>You and Harry share a smirk and laugh between yourselves for a second. &ldquo;Baby girl, you&rsquo;ve never been to them, how do you know you don&rsquo;t like them?&rdquo; You challenge with stifled grin.</p><p>&ldquo;I just know I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; She grumbles with a shrug.</p><p>&ldquo;We only stop at Leigh Delamere because you lot always want a KFC rather than a McDonald&rsquo;s.&rdquo; You remind her with a little giggle.</p><p>&ldquo;A tradition that you started, love.&rdquo; Harry nudges you.</p><p>You pause for a moment, glancing between your husband and your children before settling back into your seat. &ldquo;Alright, fair&rsquo;s fair I guess.&rdquo;</p><p>Your little family snigger at your surrender, and you&rsquo;re silently thankful that the atmosphere is a lot calmer than it was half an hour ago, and that Harry is seemingly managing to keep his cool with regards to his current car situation.</p><p>Harry pulls off into the services, parking the car in a far corner of the large car park under some trees to avoid any suspecting onlookers, a habit he&rsquo;d adopted way before he even met you. He used to claim it was to keep the sun off it, but in a cold winter that&rsquo;s a fairly poor excuse.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with it?&rdquo; You ask as he pulls the leaver by his feet to release the bonnet.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. I think it&rsquo;s the oil, but I might be wrong.&rdquo; He mumbles as he climbs out.</p><p>You follow behind him, the kids clambering out but keeping out of the way as the two of you asses the state of his car. You want to say it&rsquo;s probably to do with the fact it&rsquo;s been left so long without being driven, especially since Gemma normally takes it for a drive every so often while she can but maybe hasn&rsquo;t had a chance to recently, but for the sake of avoiding another argument you keep quiet.</p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t take Harry long to decide that he should probably call someone out to have a look, so as he rings the AA you take your family to get something to eat. Twenty minutes later the breakdown recovery man shows up, and Harry takes Dillon along with him while you and Fee stay put to wander the few shops.</p><p>&ldquo;Mum, can I get this?&rdquo; Fee interrupts your book browsing to wiggle a cheap looking plush toy in your face.</p><p>Your brows raise like a natural instinct. &ldquo;Er, what on Earth for?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For my beanie baby collection.&rdquo; She answers as if your question were dumb.</p><p>&ldquo;But&hellip; it&rsquo;s not&hellip; it&rsquo;s not a beanie baby, Fee.&rdquo; The beanie baby collection she had was actually yours, and there was no way in hell she&rsquo;d be getting a shit toy to add to an otherwise pristine collection.</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip; can I get it anyway?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, Fee. Put it back.&rdquo; You realise now that you sound like your own mother, but you ignore that thought, mentally shoving it all the way to the back of your mind and locking it up. You refuse to believe you&rsquo;re anything like your mother.</p><p>&ldquo;Boo,&rdquo; She scoffs, shoving the toy back into the cage she&rsquo;d pulled it from with a scowl, grandma would&rsquo;ve let me have it.&rdquo;</p><p>And no, she&rsquo;s not talking about Anne, she&rsquo;s talking about your mother. &ldquo;Yeah well, Grandma&rsquo;s not here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Will she be there later?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not if your Uncle Max has got anything to do with it.&rdquo; You remind her, since your brother has less of a relationship with your mum than you do, and they live twenty minutes away from each other.</p><p>~</p><p>&ldquo;Mum, look at this.&rdquo; Fee giggles as she shows you her phone.</p><p>It&rsquo;s been an hour since Harry and Dillon went to meet the recovery bloke, and they&rsquo;re still with him. Both you and Fee are growing restless and irate, now sitting in a coffee shop on your second round of coffees.</p><p>You watch Fee&rsquo;s phone as she plays a video of Dillon from just a moment ago, half his frame on one side whilst in the background Harry stresses watching the breakdown man fiddle with his car. You shouldn&rsquo;t laugh, but Dillon quietly singing the words to Daughtry&rsquo;s Breakdown over the top of their talking makes it hard not to howl. You&rsquo;re not sure if Harry&rsquo;s noticed, but if he has he&rsquo;s going a fantastic job of ignoring him.</p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s he sent that to?&rdquo; You ask worriedly, still struggling to contain your smirk.</p><p>Fee shrugs with a mirrored expression. &ldquo;Dunno, probably everyone.&rdquo;</p><p>You cringe lightly, but you&rsquo;re still unable to stop your laughter. &ldquo;Come on, lets get something for the drive and go.&rdquo;</p><p>~</p><p>Once you&rsquo;re back outside the breakdown man is just pulling off. You watch him drive away and then look to Harry with an expectant expression.</p><p>&ldquo;All sorted?&rdquo;</p><p>He rolls his eyes and nods lightly. &ldquo;Yeah, <i>finally</i>. Still have no idea what the actual problem was. Seems like he didn&rsquo;t either.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh well,&rdquo; you stroke his arm as he leans in to kiss your cheek, &ldquo;sorted now. We got you water and a coffee, weren&rsquo;t sure which one you&rsquo;d want.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry beams at you and takes the bottle and coffee from your hands. &ldquo;Both at the moment.&rdquo;</p><p>You giggle and hurry back around to the passenger side as the rest of your family climb back into the car. Within moments you&rsquo;re back on the motorway while Dillon takes the lead with the music, and once again you&rsquo;re cackling when he plays Breakdown first through the car speakers.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><b>~<a href=\"http://waitingfortwilight.tumblr.com/post/182919772299/a-series-of-parental-events-masterlist\">Series Masterlist~</a></b></p><p>Gracias muchachas(?)!</p><p>Tag list:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRQvNGuL791trMASjjacTyQ\">@pxrrishly</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgPyqI5CkEId8g7xFggm2Hg\">@permanentllyharry</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb5MZxMvKL3E9V-fzr16asg\">@talesofstyles</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUftrmoCR-gJ36qDkBozOAg\">@abundantlyabundant</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mC46KFufQzMQFQPY1dCvfcA\">@joan-of-disappointment</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m73AsCPI6pl5ydzYNqZA7ig\">@staceystoleyourheart</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYYD0_lJbE8J3m-qWYoZ2Ww\">@hoeforhaz</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlRbiKuRhgrY3E3H8bL5cIg\">@harry12styles94</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNcSwE3yuAMUrJFCByV9VEA\">@belikebebe</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw8YPeV1kp6lQtCreciPNCQ\">@harryismydaddy21</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGFOmVWpQgDRviVbQYGjJ8w\">@meet-me-in-the-harry</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5sffYoPzjk56Rs6ZvKn9FQ\">@joycelovedorial</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp_6aoPyziVdi6ZXi6B8LjQ\">@evaolin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmcxuUK9ZWplnHQCdhUVD1A\">@harrystyles-concepts</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfxkucLlCoWB5Gmly8d8H6Q\">@harryisalittleshit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6jWlNWmGyQNYnEd6-SS92A\">@newtosaur250</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myJAa8KxYrK4vh_yQTZ_60g\">@sydneys-life-blog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZRip2ZNdgboKd6U6cXPvGA\">@flowerrrrrchilddd</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgrGBah2yj4TnFyzYRijzTQ\">@belle-ofthe-sea</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbryUSDk8hHw5rIDbYFA7aQ\">@grace-leigh</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD79q662XJ4yMKN7-cXEIJQ\">@winchesterwife27</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqFIrbUtoEAyD3S9kiL95Nw\">@gangofhoes</a></p></p>",
