You can read them on my A03 or on here @LoveUStylinson. Anyways, I have always been a fan of Marvel movies but it wasn't until i watched Spider-man H that I shipped anyone. That's when I fell down head first into the starker rabbit hole, and alas here I am. Expect some fics soon!

Approximate arrival time will be in 54 seconds.&rdquo; FRIDAY&rsquo;s voice spoke through the room, causing Peter to jump in excitement. </p><p>One of the puppies barked at the movement and Peter whipped around to shush it, &ldquo;<i>Shh</i>! Don&rsquo;t blow this for us!&rdquo; He quietly yelled before running towards the elevator, stopping abruptly as it dinged.</p><p>Peter hastily leaned against the couch and put his hand on his hip in an attempt to look natural. He smiled as the doors opened, revealing Tony, &ldquo;Heyyyy, Mr. Stark!&rdquo; </p><p>Tony looked up from the tablet he held in his hand, the tired look on his face shifting brighter as he caught sight of Peter, &ldquo;Hey kid, what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; He asked as he walked over to the boy and ruffled his hair.</p><p>Peter ducked away with a laugh, &ldquo;Oh nothing just being as normal as a mutated teenager can be- so <i>howareyoudoing</i>?&rdquo; He asked quickly as Tony put down his tablet on the table.</p><p>Tony gave Peter a look, a questioning smile playing on his face, &ldquo;Well&hellip; I&rsquo;m a little tired and.. stressed, God, Pete I&rsquo;m completely out of it.&rdquo; He sighed, running a hand over his face.</p><p>Peter nodded along with his words, &ldquo;Yeah.. I kind of figured that so I-&rdquo; His sentence was interrupted by a high pitched bark.</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s head snapped up at the sound and he stepped away from the table he was leaning against, &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter opened his mouth to respond but was cut off by Tony as he neared the living room, &ldquo;Where did all these puppies come from?!&rdquo; He asked, staring in shock at the mass of dogs surrounded by pillows.</p><p>&ldquo;I found a website that let&rsquo;s you rent puppies for a day!&rdquo; Peter explained as he ran forward, a smile glowing on his face, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re cute, right?&rdquo; He asked as he bent down and picked one up, laughing when it licked his cheek.</p><p>&ldquo;Wha- well, <i>yeah</i> they&rsquo;re cute, kid. But why are they..?&rdquo; Tony motioned towards the dogs and then around his living room.</p><p>Peter walked over to his mentor and gave him a little nudge towards the puppies, &ldquo;I noticed that you were really stressed so I got you something that always makes me feel better. Usually I just look at pictures of dogs but this is so much better- oh my <i>God </i>look at them they&rsquo;re literally the cutest, I-&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Pete.&rdquo; Tony stopped the kid, placing his hands on his shoulders, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re rambling.&rdquo;</p><p>Heat shot into Peter&rsquo;s face as his smile grew, &ldquo;Ha, sorry. I was just really excited and.. nervous to show you, y'know because I didn&rsquo;t know if you liked dogs or if you were- oh my God are you allergic to them, I didn&rsquo;t-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter!&rdquo; Tony laughed, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m not allergic to dogs.&rdquo; He reassured him before ruffling his curls again, smiling, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good kid. And these pups-&rdquo; Tony bent down and scooped one up, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re just what I needed kid, thank you.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter&rsquo;s face lit up impossibly brighter at the man&rsquo;s words. He laughed as Tony pulled him into a hug before pushing the kid into the pit of puppies.</p><p>Peter yelped in surprise as he fell onto the blankets before getting attacked by all of the dogs. Tony laughed as the dogs licked at his face and crawled over him, their little tails wagging.</p><p>&ldquo;Mason, I swear to God!&rdquo; Peter suddenly shouted as he grabbed one of the puppies that was trying to escape.</p><p>Tony stopped moving, at least four puppies still in his arms, &ldquo;Mason?&rdquo; He asked, staring at the dog Peter was holding.</p><p>Peter nodded, &ldquo;Yeah, they all have names!&rdquo; He held the dog in front of Tony&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;This is Mason, he&rsquo;s been trying to escape all morning. That&rsquo;s Nugget, he almost fell off of the couch earlier. This is Toothless, oh! That little white one is Cotton and that one is Cactus- he bites, and-&rdquo; Peter rambled off all of the puppies names, including facts about the dog and what type of breed they were.</p><p>Tony watched as the kid talked about the puppies, the light in his eyes filling Tony&rsquo;s chest with warmth. He smiled at the kid and for the first time in a long time, he felt completely content.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Oh this is definitely the SOFTEST thing I&rsquo;ve ever written wOw you really just brought this side of me out</p>",

Tony asked, rubbing his thumb over Peter&rsquo;s cheek again.</p><p>&ldquo;I- I don&rsquo;t-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;-It means they&rsquo;re making love,&rdquo; Tony murmured, using his free hand to grab Peter by the waist and pull him closer.&nbsp; Tony breathed hotly against Peter&rsquo;s ear and he was pretty sure that Peter was now crying.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make love to you, Parker.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Peter managed to say, his voice desperate and strained.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want that, hm?&rdquo; Tony asked softly, biting gently on Peter&rsquo;s ear and hearing a small whimper come from his trembling lips.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I- I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay, sweetheart, we won&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; Tony said, letting go of him.&nbsp; Peter looked surprised, but mostly relieved.&nbsp; Tony watched the boy wipe away his tears, and he smiled down at him.&nbsp; Peter was truly beautiful.&nbsp; Tony didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d ever seen anyone so beautiful in his life. He let himself appreciate Peter&rsquo;s beauty for a minute, before he grabbed him roughly.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;re you doing?&rdquo; Peter gasped, trying to break free from Tony&rsquo;s grasp but failing completely.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to fuck you,&rdquo; Tony growled, turning Peter around and throwing him down onto the bottom bunk with much more force than what was necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to make love, so you&rsquo;re getting fucked.&nbsp; And you&rsquo;re going to enjoy it for me, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Please</i>,&rdquo; Peter sobbed.&nbsp; It was almost heart-breaking for Tony hear the boy beg so sweetly for him not to do it, but he knew he had to.&nbsp; He had to make Peter <i>his</i>.&nbsp; He had to make all of the other prisoners know that Peter was his.&nbsp; He had to make <i>Peter</i>&nbsp;know that he belonged to someone now.</p><p>Tony leaned down, pushing his whole weight against Peter&rsquo;s small body.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You belong to me now, alright?&nbsp; Shhh, it&rsquo;s okay.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t hurt you.&nbsp; Shhh.&rdquo; He placed his hand over Peter&rsquo;s mouth, silencing him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good boy.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter was staring up at Tony with tear-stained eyes, already looking completely broken.&nbsp; Tony longed to see what he&rsquo;d look like <i>after</i>.&nbsp; He pressed a gentle kiss to Peter&rsquo;s forehead and then slowly started to undress.</p><p>&ldquo;Welcome to prison, baby.&rdquo;</p></p>",
