The arms to the person had you pulled into his chest, which was slowly rising and falling to the beat of his lungs. He was wearing a black cloak. And the fur was tickling your cheeks. But the thick, black cotton was draped over your frame. You could feel it against your bare arms and neck. </p><!-- more --><p>Your shirt? Resting on the back of a chair, neatly. Your heavy shoes next to the shirt, in the chair. </p><p>Who was he? Your eyes opened and looked up to see the scruff on someone\u2019s jaw and cheeks. Jon? It came rushing back to you. All of it. The sight of the fire growing higher and- you whimpered suddenly and Jon\u2019s arms squeezed you a bit as his eyes opened slightly to try and sneak a look down at you. But you hid your face in his neck. The top of your head on the bottom of his chin. </p><p>\u201cShhh\u201d He soothed, rubbing your back \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>He thought of it quickly, to get your mind off of the burning and death of a man you didn\u2019t know and onto something he thought would be calming. </p><p>\u201cTell me, what\u2019s your homeland like?\u201d</p><p>Your breathing went from uneven and rough to smooth and calming as you thought about it. You swear he could feel the gears turning in your head through your skull. But as you thought about it, you calmed down. </p><p>\u201cLarge. Bright lights everywhere.\u201d You stated. Both of your arms folded up against your chest and each of your legs on either side of his leg that was closest to the ceiling. </p><p>\u201cWhat is it called?\u201d Jon asked, playing with the ends of your hair as if in a trance. </p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m from the city of San Diego. The state of California, and the country of the United States. I\u2019ve never really left home&hellip; Jesus I miss my mom.\u201d You sobbed out. </p><p>Was it an instinct for him to pull you even closer to his body? Maybe. Or maybe he just felt like you needed the comfort. </p><p>You wrapped your arms around his torso as well, holding him close. You barley knew this man, he looked strong enough to kill you with his bare hands. Yet you trusted him completely.</p><p>You looked up at him, so close to his face and pulled out of his arms and rolled out of the bed, walking to your old backpack, pulling out your mother\u2019s walkman and crawling back into bed and into his arms.</p><p>You had paired the walkman with your ear buds when your mother gave it to you when she grounded you. But you took one of the buds and reached up to Jon\u2019s ear that was facing the ceiling and placed it in. He gave you a strange look as you took the other and put it in your own ear before looking down at the walkman and pressing play. </p><p>He noticeably jumped when the music started, but he kept eye contact with you as the Micheal Jackson song started. </p><p>They told him don&rsquo;t you ever come around here</p><p>Don&rsquo;t want to see your face, you better disappear</p><p>The fire&rsquo;s in their eyes and their words are really clear</p><p>So beat it, just beat it</p><p>He only smiled and shook his head slightly \u201cYou\u2019re full of surprises aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>You only shrugged, snuggling close into his warm embrace, letting the music play through the cassette tape and into the ear buds peacefully even if it was the most hyper song on the list. </p><p>Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick</p><p>And think of you</p><p>Caught up in circles</p><p>Confusion is nothing new</p><p>Flashback, warm nights</p><p>Almost left behind</p><p>Suitcases of memories</p><p>Time after time</p><p>You looked up at him before back down at his chest and wrapped your arm around his waist singing along to the lyrics </p><p>\u201cSometimes you picture me I&rsquo;m walking too far ahead You&rsquo;re calling to me, I can&rsquo;t hear What you&rsquo;ve said Then you say, go slow I fall behind The second hand unwinds\u201d</p><p>Melisandre and Stannis had left and that meant the only person you truly trusted while in Castle Black was Jon. </p><p style=\"\"><br/></p><p style=\"\">\u2022</p><p style=\"\"><br/></p><p>The jacket was zipped up as you sat down across from the maester, Jon sitting right next him.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, like a hundred year old man slowly freezing to death.\u201d</p><p>You smiled at that, looking around at books and stood to check them out. You had always loved reading. Though it wasn\u2019t a passion, you did enjoy it greatly. </p><p>They continued to talk as you slipped a book out of it\u2019s place. It looked like it hadn\u2019t been touched in years from the amount of dust on it. </p><p>You knew what they were talking about. Jon had spoken to you about the wildlings. Perhaps in an attempt to know what to do. Even though he was the one in charge he felt as if he needed advice. Though you supposed that a came with the territory of being in charge of people. </p><p>Was he in charge of you? A girl who knew how to use guns and bows, and who always secretly carried a switch blade in her bag? Even though if she was caught at school she\u2019d get suspended? </p><p><br/>\nA girl who told her Platoon Commander to \u2018get fucked?\u2019 And then proceeded to argue with Commander and Master Gunns?</p><p>You were never really good with whatever this feeling towards that you had towards Jon. Fondness? Maybe. You had friends of course, and you would have done anything for them. But he- You didn\u2019t know how to explain the twenty year old pretty boy. </p><p>You gazed over at Jon only to see him looking back at you. You both quickly looked away from each other. A deep pink spreading across your cheeks as you opened the book to a random page and made a face at the awful hand writing. That was held in the book. You could hear the Maester laugh.</p><p><br/></p><p style=\"\">\u2022</p><p style=\"\"><br/></p><p>\u201cAnd her?\u201d</p><p>Jon turned to look at you as you read from a book you had \u2018snuck\u2019 out of the library. It was quite obvious to him when he saw the bulky thing pushing the boundaries of you bag. You had that&hellip; thing playing in your ears. And the beat of a song could be heard from where he and Tormund where sitting.</p><p>\u201cYou can trust her. She has no ill will against anyone here. She\u2019s-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNot from here? You think I didn\u2019t notice the moment she ran up those stairs to get that bow? If she was from here she\u2019d quietly sit by.\u201d</p><p>Jon sighed slightly and nodded \u201cShe has a good heart. But I don\u2019t know where it lies.\u201d Tormund only gave Jon a knowing look. </p><p>\u201cYou like her.\u201d</p><p>Jon ignored the question Tormund had asked, that didn\u2019t even really sound like a question.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll go north. Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here. I\u2019ll open the gates for them and let them through. I\u2019ll find them lands to settle south of the wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t kneel for you and neither will I.\u201d Tormund responded. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want them to kneel for me. I want them to fight with me when the time comes.\u201d Jon shot back. </p><p>You took an earbud out and looked up from your stolen book to watch and hear the argument clearly. </p><p>\u201cThe day I ask my people to fight with the crows is the day my people cut my guts from my belly and make me eat them\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I interrupt?\u201d You asked </p><p>\u201cAh, so she has a voice!\u201d Tormund exclaimed looking at you with a small, interested smile on his face. </p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d</p><p>You gave Jon a nervous smile before turning to Tormund. \u201cI don\u2019t know, fully what\u2019s going on. But I do know that whatever it is&hellip; It\u2019s bad. Where I\u2019m from bad things happen a lot. Throughout history and even in modern day. A lot of treaties have been signed before. With countries who have been at war for centuries and centuries.\u201d</p><p>Tormund raised a brow and nodded once \u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike France and England. Spain and England. Spain a long time ago was okay with England. After all, their princess Cathrine married the king of England. It created an alliance. But&hellip; when the king annulled their marriage for another woman, things went south. And France&hellip; Well&hellip; they fought a war for a 116 years. And she my country succeeded from England and won a major battle against them. The French and Spanish allied with us against them. Cause England was a common enemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirl, we aren\u2019t fighting a kingdom-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not. But you\u2019re both fighting a common enemy. You can fight them, defeat them and then fight each other. Just don\u2019t make the job easier for them by killing each other off before who ever it is gets here. Don\u2019t let the men women and children die because of your pride. Only idiot kings do that. But you don\u2019t look a king. Or an idiot.\u201d</p><p>Jon tilted his head in curiosity and Tormund smiled. \u201cI like her&hellip;They\u2019re at Hardhome. And If I\u2019m going, you two are as well.\u201d</p><p style=\"\"><br/></p><p style=\"\">\u2022</p><p style=\"\"><br/></p><p>You sat on Jon\u2019s bed as he wrote things down. You could practically see the wrinkles permanently forming on his forehead while he wrote. Your history text book and ROTC field manual next to you as you watched him intently. You wanted to interrupt him, to make the wrinkle of stress be erased from his forehead. </p><p>But instead you let out a small sigh from your nose before reaching for the walkman and putting your earbuds in. Pressing play you could hear the intro of Fast Car. Your dad always loved this song. </p><p>You picked up the book you had taken from the library and began reading, humming to the lyrics of the song. Reading about something called \u2018The Dance of Dragons\u2019 </p><p>You were deep into the book by now. Having been reading wherever you and Jon went. </p><p>Ever since Stannis had yelled at you for letting Jon kill Mance with an arrow and since he and Millsandre had left, you had found a calm company with Jon. Not wanting to be alone in such a strange place. You followed him like a lost puppy most days. Your nose in a book. </p><p>You figured he\u2019d taken some sort of liking to you since you met him. He no longer looked at you like you were strange. He often brought you food, and water while you held the fort that was his room down. </p><p>You felt something in the world go slightly askew as Jessie\u2019s Girl began to play right after and you stopped humming. You slowly raised your head to see Jon staring at you. His face relaxed, but filled with adoration.That\u2019s the only word you could find to describe the look he was giving you for a few long, music filled moments before he looked down. You sucked in a breath and looked down at your book before smiling slightly.</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><p>He looked back at you, eyes slightly wide that you had acknowledged him just mere seconds after you caught him staring at you</p><p>\u201cTwenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sixteen.\u201d You responded with a small smile. \u201cwanna play Penny for Your Backstory?\u201d</p><p>Jon rose a brow quizzically at you \u201cPenny?\u201d You nodded. \u201cCome on, sit over here.\u201d You encouraged, taking your headphones off and turning the walkman off as you reached for your bag, pulling out your wallet and dumping a large pile of Pennys on the center of the bed before you climbed to sit across from him. \u201cC\u2019mon! We can change it up!\u201d</p><p>He smiled slightly and sat down on the floor his arms and chin resting on the furs as he picked up the currency of money that was useless to you, that you always got back when buying lunch. This had to be the past three years worth of pennies, just from lunch, and from your laziness on not putting it in the \u2018Pasta for Pennies\u2019 jar at school.</p><p>He looked at one particularly rusted one and looked at it funny, \u201cIn God We Trust? Liberty? 1964?\u201d</p><p>\u201c1964!?\u201d You questioned happily snatching the small coin from his hands looking at the year with a bright smile on your face. </p><p>\u201cThis was 55 years ago!\u201d You said putting it back in your wallet \u201cAriani\u2019s gonna love this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does all of it mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell&hellip; In God We Trust is there because my country was partly founded on the fact that everyone wanted to follow their own religion. But it was a different branch of Christianity. So&hellip; In God We Trust. Liberty is French, for Freedom.\u201d You explained. \u201cAnd the number is the year it was made. So-\u201c</p><p>You picked up another coin and flipped it to look at the profile of Abraham Lincoln \u201c2003\u201d You said holding it up proudly. \u201cThe year I was born!\u201d</p><p>Jon only nodded, trying to keep up with what you were saying about your money.</p><p>\u201cAnd the man?\u201d</p><p>You only smiled \u201cOur sixteenth president. Abraham Lincoln. He was shot and killed during a play.\u201d You said flipping the coin up in the air and catching it as it came down. </p><p>\u201cWe could do the get to know me version? You ask a question and based on how personal it is we get to choose the amount coins we get from it. Person who has zero coins left gets asked one major personal question, and they can\u2019t say no. And we both have to answer the question.\u201d</p><p>Jon only nodded once more as you split up the coins in half. Half for him, half for yourself. </p><p>\u201cYou start.\u201d You encouraged. </p><p>\u201cAre you a noble woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s two coins.\u201d </p><p>He looked at you and dug two out of his pile and tossing them across the bed.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d You answered putting the two into your pile. </p><p>You studied him, making a visual outline of his silhouette and saving it in the back of your mind.</p><p>\u201cYou come from a noble family?\u201d You asked back, thinking he had forgotten the rules for a moment</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p style=\"\"><br/></p><p style=\"\">\u2022\u2022\u2022</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a>\u00a0@<a href=\"https://strangerthingsholland.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">strangerthingsholland</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQcJ41Q73x6-KoyP-pxsiLQ\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQcJ41Q73x6-KoyP-pxsiLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@starkbelova</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m43S12MMFkIn9WZ9uwO5LgQ\" target=\"_blank\">@missminx1993</a>\u00a0@<a href=\"https://blxkstar.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Milktea loser\" target=\"_blank\">blxkstar</a><br/></p>",

Your heavy shoes next to the shirt, in the chair. </p><p>Who was he? Your eyes opened and looked up to see the scruff on someone\u2019s jaw and cheeks. Jon? It came rushing back to you. All of it. The sight of the fire growing higher and- you whimpered suddenly and Jon\u2019s arms squeezed you a bit as his eyes opened slightly to try and sneak a look down at you. But you hid your face in his neck. The top of your head on the bottom of his chin. </p><p>\u201cShhh\u201d He soothed, rubbing your back \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>He thought of it quickly, to get your mind off of the burning and death of a man you didn\u2019t know and onto something he thought would be calming. </p><p>\u201cTell me, what\u2019s your homeland like?\u201d</p><p>Your breathing went from uneven and rough to smooth and calming as you thought about it. You swear he could feel the gears turning in your head through your skull. But as you thought about it, you calmed down. </p><p>\u201cLarge. Bright lights everywhere.\u201d You stated. Both of your arms folded up against your chest and each of your legs on either side of his leg that was closest to the ceiling. </p><p>\u201cWhat is it called?\u201d Jon asked, playing with the ends of your hair as if in a trance. </p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m from the city of San Diego. The state of California, and the country of the United States. I\u2019ve never really left home\u2026 Jesus I miss my mom.\u201d You sobbed out. </p><p>Was it an instinct for him to pull you even closer to his body? Maybe.

The arms to the person had you pulled into his chest, which was slowly rising and falling to the beat of his lungs. He was wearing a black cloak. And the fur was tickling your cheeks. But the thick, black cotton was draped over your frame. You could feel it against your bare arms and neck. </p>[[MORE]]<p>Your shirt? Resting on the back of a chair, neatly. Your heavy shoes next to the shirt, in the chair. </p><p>Who was he? Your eyes opened and looked up to see the scruff on someone\u2019s jaw and cheeks. Jon? It came rushing back to you. All of it. The sight of the fire growing higher and- you whimpered suddenly and Jon\u2019s arms squeezed you a bit as his eyes opened slightly to try and sneak a look down at you. But you hid your face in his neck. The top of your head on the bottom of his chin. </p><p>\u201cShhh\u201d He soothed, rubbing your back \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>He thought of it quickly, to get your mind off of the burning and death of a man you didn\u2019t know and onto something he thought would be calming. </p><p>\u201cTell me, what\u2019s your homeland like?\u201d</p><p>Your breathing went from uneven and rough to smooth and calming as you thought about it. You swear he could feel the gears turning in your head through your skull. But as you thought about it, you calmed down. </p><p>\u201cLarge. Bright lights everywhere.\u201d You stated. Both of your arms folded up against your chest and each of your legs on either side of his leg that was closest to the ceiling. </p><p>\u201cWhat is it called?\u201d Jon asked, playing with the ends of your hair as if in a trance. </p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m from the city of San Diego. The state of California, and the country of the United States. I\u2019ve never really left home\u2026 Jesus I miss my mom.\u201d You sobbed out. </p><p>Was it an instinct for him to pull you even closer to his body? Maybe. Or maybe he just felt like you needed the comfort. </p><p>You wrapped your arms around his torso as well, holding him close. You barley knew this man, he looked strong enough to kill you with his bare hands. Yet you trusted him completely.</p><p>You looked up at him, so close to his face and pulled out of his arms and rolled out of the bed, walking to your old backpack, pulling out your mother\u2019s walkman and crawling back into bed and into his arms.</p><p>You had paired the walkman with your ear buds when your mother gave it to you when she grounded you. But you took one of the buds and reached up to Jon\u2019s ear that was facing the ceiling and placed it in. He gave you a strange look as you took the other and put it in your own ear before looking down at the walkman and pressing play. </p><p>He noticeably jumped when the music started, but he kept eye contact with you as the Micheal Jackson song started. </p><p>They told him don\u2019t you ever come around here</p><p>Don\u2019t want to see your face, you better disappear</p><p>The fire\u2019s in their eyes and their words are really clear</p><p>So beat it, just beat it</p><p>He only smiled and shook his head slightly \u201cYou\u2019re full of surprises aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>You only shrugged, snuggling close into his warm embrace, letting the music play through the cassette tape and into the ear buds peacefully even if it was the most hyper song on the list. </p><p>Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick</p><p>And think of you</p><p>Caught up in circles</p><p>Confusion is nothing new</p><p>Flashback, warm nights</p><p>Almost left behind</p><p>Suitcases of memories</p><p>Time after time</p><p>You looked up at him before back down at his chest and wrapped your arm around his waist singing along to the lyrics </p><p>\u201cSometimes you picture me I\u2019m walking too far ahead You\u2019re calling to me, I can\u2019t hear What you\u2019ve said Then you say, go slow I fall behind The second hand unwinds\u201d</p><p>Melisandre and Stannis had left and that meant the only person you truly trusted while in Castle Black was Jon. </p><p style=\"\"><br></p><p style=\"\">\u2022</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><p>The jacket was zipped up as you sat down across from the maester, Jon sitting right next him.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, like a hundred year old man slowly freezing to death.\u201d</p><p>You smiled at that, looking around at books and stood to check them out. You had always loved reading. Though it wasn\u2019t a passion, you did enjoy it greatly. </p><p>They continued to talk as you slipped a book out of it\u2019s place. It looked like it hadn\u2019t been touched in years from the amount of dust on it. </p><p>You knew what they were talking about. Jon had spoken to you about the wildlings. Perhaps in an attempt to know what to do. Even though he was the one in charge he felt as if he needed advice. Though you supposed that a came with the territory of being in charge of people. </p><p>Was he in charge of you? A girl who knew how to use guns and bows, and who always secretly carried a switch blade in her bag? Even though if she was caught at school she\u2019d get suspended? </p><p><br>\nA girl who told her Platoon Commander to \u2018get fucked?\u2019 And then proceeded to argue with Commander and Master Gunns?</p><p>You were never really good with whatever this feeling towards that you had towards Jon. Fondness? Maybe. You had friends of course, and you would have done anything for them. But he- You didn\u2019t know how to explain the twenty year old pretty boy. </p><p>You gazed over at Jon only to see him looking back at you. You both quickly looked away from each other. A deep pink spreading across your cheeks as you opened the book to a random page and made a face at the awful hand writing. That was held in the book. You could hear the Maester laugh.</p><p><br></p><p style=\"\">\u2022</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><p>\u201cAnd her?\u201d</p><p>Jon turned to look at you as you read from a book you had \u2018snuck\u2019 out of the library. It was quite obvious to him when he saw the bulky thing pushing the boundaries of you bag. You had that\u2026 thing playing in your ears. And the beat of a song could be heard from where he and Tormund where sitting.</p><p>\u201cYou can trust her. She has no ill will against anyone here. She\u2019s-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNot from here? You think I didn\u2019t notice the moment she ran up those stairs to get that bow? If she was from here she\u2019d quietly sit by.\u201d</p><p>Jon sighed slightly and nodded \u201cShe has a good heart. But I don\u2019t know where it lies.\u201d Tormund only gave Jon a knowing look. </p><p>\u201cYou like her.\u201d</p><p>Jon ignored the question Tormund had asked, that didn\u2019t even really sound like a question.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll go north. Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here. I\u2019ll open the gates for them and let them through. I\u2019ll find them lands to settle south of the wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t kneel for you and neither will I.\u201d Tormund responded. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want them to kneel for me. I want them to fight with me when the time comes.\u201d Jon shot back. </p><p>You took an earbud out and looked up from your stolen book to watch and hear the argument clearly. </p><p>\u201cThe day I ask my people to fight with the crows is the day my people cut my guts from my belly and make me eat them\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I interrupt?\u201d You asked </p><p>\u201cAh, so she has a voice!\u201d Tormund exclaimed looking at you with a small, interested smile on his face. </p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d</p><p>You gave Jon a nervous smile before turning to Tormund. \u201cI don\u2019t know, fully what\u2019s going on. But I do know that whatever it is\u2026 It\u2019s bad. Where I\u2019m from bad things happen a lot. Throughout history and even in modern day. A lot of treaties have been signed before. With countries who have been at war for centuries and centuries.\u201d</p><p>Tormund raised a brow and nodded once \u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike France and England. Spain and England. Spain a long time ago was okay with England. After all, their princess Cathrine married the king of England. It created an alliance. But\u2026 when the king annulled their marriage for another woman, things went south. And France\u2026 Well\u2026 they fought a war for a 116 years. And she my country succeeded from England and won a major battle against them. The French and Spanish allied with us against them. Cause England was a common enemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirl, we aren\u2019t fighting a kingdom-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not. But you\u2019re both fighting a common enemy. You can fight them, defeat them and then fight each other. Just don\u2019t make the job easier for them by killing each other off before who ever it is gets here. Don\u2019t let the men women and children die because of your pride. Only idiot kings do that. But you don\u2019t look a king. Or an idiot.\u201d</p><p>Jon tilted his head in curiosity and Tormund smiled. \u201cI like her\u2026They\u2019re at Hardhome. And If I\u2019m going, you two are as well.\u201d</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><p style=\"\">\u2022</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><p>You sat on Jon\u2019s bed as he wrote things down. You could practically see the wrinkles permanently forming on his forehead while he wrote. Your history text book and ROTC field manual next to you as you watched him intently. You wanted to interrupt him, to make the wrinkle of stress be erased from his forehead. </p><p>But instead you let out a small sigh from your nose before reaching for the walkman and putting your earbuds in. Pressing play you could hear the intro of Fast Car. Your dad always loved this song. </p><p>You picked up the book you had taken from the library and began reading, humming to the lyrics of the song. Reading about something called \u2018The Dance of Dragons\u2019 </p><p>You were deep into the book by now. Having been reading wherever you and Jon went. </p><p>Ever since Stannis had yelled at you for letting Jon kill Mance with an arrow and since he and Millsandre had left, you had found a calm company with Jon. Not wanting to be alone in such a strange place. You followed him like a lost puppy most days. Your nose in a book. </p><p>You figured he\u2019d taken some sort of liking to you since you met him. He no longer looked at you like you were strange. He often brought you food, and water while you held the fort that was his room down. </p><p>You felt something in the world go slightly askew as Jessie\u2019s Girl began to play right after and you stopped humming. You slowly raised your head to see Jon staring at you. His face relaxed, but filled with adoration.That\u2019s the only word you could find to describe the look he was giving you for a few long, music filled moments before he looked down. You sucked in a breath and looked down at your book before smiling slightly.</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><p>He looked back at you, eyes slightly wide that you had acknowledged him just mere seconds after you caught him staring at you</p><p>\u201cTwenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sixteen.\u201d You responded with a small smile. \u201cwanna play Penny for Your Backstory?\u201d</p><p>Jon rose a brow quizzically at you \u201cPenny?\u201d You nodded. \u201cCome on, sit over here.\u201d You encouraged, taking your headphones off and turning the walkman off as you reached for your bag, pulling out your wallet and dumping a large pile of Pennys on the center of the bed before you climbed to sit across from him. \u201cC\u2019mon! We can change it up!\u201d</p><p>He smiled slightly and sat down on the floor his arms and chin resting on the furs as he picked up the currency of money that was useless to you, that you always got back when buying lunch. This had to be the past three years worth of pennies, just from lunch, and from your laziness on not putting it in the \u2018Pasta for Pennies\u2019 jar at school.</p><p>He looked at one particularly rusted one and looked at it funny, \u201cIn God We Trust? Liberty? 1964?\u201d</p><p>\u201c1964!?\u201d You questioned happily snatching the small coin from his hands looking at the year with a bright smile on your face. </p><p>\u201cThis was 55 years ago!\u201d You said putting it back in your wallet \u201cAriani\u2019s gonna love this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does all of it mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 In God We Trust is there because my country was partly founded on the fact that everyone wanted to follow their own religion.

So-\u201c</p><p>You picked up another coin and flipped it to look at the profile of Abraham Lincoln \u201c2003\u201d You said holding it up proudly. \u201cThe year I was born!\u201d</p><p>Jon only nodded, trying to keep up with what you were saying about your money.</p><p>\u201cAnd the man?\u201d</p><p>You only smiled \u201cOur sixteenth president.

Both of your arms folded up against your chest and each of your legs on either side of his leg that was closest to the ceiling. </p><p>&ldquo;What is it called?&rdquo; Jon asked, playing with the ends of your hair as if in a trance. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m from the city of San Diego. The state of California, and the country of the United States. I&rsquo;ve never really left home&hellip; Jesus I miss my mom.&rdquo; You sobbed out. </p><p>Was it an instinct for him to pull you even closer to his body? Maybe. Or maybe he just felt like you needed the comfort. </p><p>You wrapped your arms around his torso as well, holding him close. You barley knew this man, he looked strong enough to kill you with his bare hands. Yet you trusted him completely.</p><p>You looked up at him, so close to his face and pulled out of his arms and rolled out of the bed, walking to your old backpack, pulling out your mother&rsquo;s walkman and crawling back into bed and into his arms.</p><p>You had paired the walkman with your ear buds when your mother gave it to you when she grounded you. But you took one of the buds and reached up to Jon&rsquo;s ear that was facing the ceiling and placed it in. He gave you a strange look as you took the other and put it in your own ear before looking down at the walkman and pressing play. </p><p>He noticeably jumped when the music started, but he kept eye contact with you as the Micheal Jackson song started. </p><p>They told him don&rsquo;t you ever come around here</p><p>Don&rsquo;t want to see your face, you better disappear</p><p>The fire&rsquo;s in their eyes and their words are really clear</p><p>So beat it, just beat it</p><p>He only smiled and shook his head slightly &ldquo;You&rsquo;re full of surprises aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>You only shrugged, snuggling close into his warm embrace, letting the music play through the cassette tape and into the ear buds peacefully even if it was the most hyper song on the list. </p><p>Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick</p><p>And think of you</p><p>Caught up in circles</p><p>Confusion is nothing new</p><p>Flashback, warm nights</p><p>Almost left behind</p><p>Suitcases of memories</p><p>Time after time</p><p>You looked up at him before back down at his chest and wrapped your arm around his waist singing along to the lyrics </p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes you picture me I&rsquo;m walking too far ahead You&rsquo;re calling to me, I can&rsquo;t hear What you&rsquo;ve said Then you say, go slow I fall behind The second hand unwinds&rdquo;</p><p>Melisandre and Stannis had left and that meant the only person you truly trusted while in Castle Black was Jon. </p><p><br /></p><p>&bull;</p><p><br /></p><p>The jacket was zipped up as you sat down across from the maester, Jon sitting right next him.</p><p>&ldquo;How are you feeling?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, like a hundred year old man slowly freezing to death.&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled at that, looking around at books and stood to check them out. You had always loved reading. Though it wasn&rsquo;t a passion, you did enjoy it greatly. </p><p>They continued to talk as you slipped a book out of it&rsquo;s place. It looked like it hadn&rsquo;t been touched in years from the amount of dust on it. </p><p>You knew what they were talking about. Jon had spoken to you about the wildlings. Perhaps in an attempt to know what to do. Even though he was the one in charge he felt as if he needed advice. Though you supposed that a came with the territory of being in charge of people. </p><p>Was he in charge of you? A girl who knew how to use guns and bows, and who always secretly carried a switch blade in her bag? Even though if she was caught at school she&rsquo;d get suspended? </p><p><br />\nA girl who told her Platoon Commander to &lsquo;get fucked?&rsquo; And then proceeded to argue with Commander and Master Gunns?</p><p>You were never really good with whatever this feeling towards that you had towards Jon. Fondness? Maybe. You had friends of course, and you would have done anything for them. But he- You didn&rsquo;t know how to explain the twenty year old pretty boy. </p><p>You gazed over at Jon only to see him looking back at you. You both quickly looked away from each other. A deep pink spreading across your cheeks as you opened the book to a random page and made a face at the awful hand writing. That was held in the book. You could hear the Maester laugh.</p><p><br /></p><p>&bull;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;And her?&rdquo;</p><p>Jon turned to look at you as you read from a book you had &lsquo;snuck&rsquo; out of the library. It was quite obvious to him when he saw the bulky thing pushing the boundaries of you bag. You had that&hellip; thing playing in your ears. And the beat of a song could be heard from where he and Tormund where sitting.</p><p>&ldquo;You can trust her. She has no ill will against anyone here. She&rsquo;s-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not from here? You think I didn&rsquo;t notice the moment she ran up those stairs to get that bow? If she was from here she&rsquo;d quietly sit by.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon sighed slightly and nodded &ldquo;She has a good heart. But I don&rsquo;t know where it lies.&rdquo; Tormund only gave Jon a knowing look. </p><p>&ldquo;You like her.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon ignored the question Tormund had asked, that didn&rsquo;t even really sound like a question.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go north. Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here. I&rsquo;ll open the gates for them and let them through. I&rsquo;ll find them lands to settle south of the wall.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t kneel for you and neither will I.&rdquo; Tormund responded. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want them to kneel for me. I want them to fight with me when the time comes.&rdquo; Jon shot back. </p><p>You took an earbud out and looked up from your stolen book to watch and hear the argument clearly. </p><p>&ldquo;The day I ask my people to fight with the crows is the day my people cut my guts from my belly and make me eat them&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can I interrupt?&rdquo; You asked </p><p>&ldquo;Ah, so she has a voice!&rdquo; Tormund exclaimed looking at you with a small, interested smile on his face. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo;</p><p>You gave Jon a nervous smile before turning to Tormund. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, fully what&rsquo;s going on. But I do know that whatever it is&hellip; It&rsquo;s bad. Where I&rsquo;m from bad things happen a lot. Throughout history and even in modern day. A lot of treaties have been signed before. With countries who have been at war for centuries and centuries.&rdquo;</p><p>Tormund raised a brow and nodded once &ldquo;Like?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like France and England. Spain and England. Spain a long time ago was okay with England. After all, their princess Cathrine married the king of England. It created an alliance. But&hellip; when the king annulled their marriage for another woman, things went south. And France&hellip; Well&hellip; they fought a war for a 116 years. And she my country succeeded from England and won a major battle against them. The French and Spanish allied with us against them. Cause England was a common enemy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Girl, we aren&rsquo;t fighting a kingdom-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re not. But you&rsquo;re both fighting a common enemy. You can fight them, defeat them and then fight each other. Just don&rsquo;t make the job easier for them by killing each other off before who ever it is gets here. Don&rsquo;t let the men women and children die because of your pride. Only idiot kings do that. But you don&rsquo;t look a king. Or an idiot.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon tilted his head in curiosity and Tormund smiled. &ldquo;I like her&hellip;They&rsquo;re at Hardhome. And If I&rsquo;m going, you two are as well.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&bull;</p><p><br /></p><p>You sat on Jon&rsquo;s bed as he wrote things down. You could practically see the wrinkles permanently forming on his forehead while he wrote. Your history text book and ROTC field manual next to you as you watched him intently. You wanted to interrupt him, to make the wrinkle of stress be erased from his forehead. </p><p>But instead you let out a small sigh from your nose before reaching for the walkman and putting your earbuds in. Pressing play you could hear the intro of Fast Car. Your dad always loved this song. </p><p>You picked up the book you had taken from the library and began reading, humming to the lyrics of the song. Reading about something called &lsquo;The Dance of Dragons&rsquo; </p><p>You were deep into the book by now. Having been reading wherever you and Jon went. </p><p>Ever since Stannis had yelled at you for letting Jon kill Mance with an arrow and since he and Millsandre had left, you had found a calm company with Jon. Not wanting to be alone in such a strange place. You followed him like a lost puppy most days. Your nose in a book. </p><p>You figured he&rsquo;d taken some sort of liking to you since you met him. He no longer looked at you like you were strange. He often brought you food, and water while you held the fort that was his room down. </p><p>You felt something in the world go slightly askew as Jessie&rsquo;s Girl began to play right after and you stopped humming. You slowly raised your head to see Jon staring at you. His face relaxed, but filled with adoration.That&rsquo;s the only word you could find to describe the look he was giving you for a few long, music filled moments before he looked down. You sucked in a breath and looked down at your book before smiling slightly.</p><p>&ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo;</p><p>He looked back at you, eyes slightly wide that you had acknowledged him just mere seconds after you caught him staring at you</p><p>&ldquo;Twenty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sixteen.&rdquo; You responded with a small smile. &ldquo;wanna play Penny for Your Backstory?&rdquo;</p><p>Jon rose a brow quizzically at you &ldquo;Penny?&rdquo; You nodded. &ldquo;Come on, sit over here.&rdquo; You encouraged, taking your headphones off and turning the walkman off as you reached for your bag, pulling out your wallet and dumping a large pile of Pennys on the center of the bed before you climbed to sit across from him. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon! We can change it up!&rdquo;</p><p>He smiled slightly and sat down on the floor his arms and chin resting on the furs as he picked up the currency of money that was useless to you, that you always got back when buying lunch. This had to be the past three years worth of pennies, just from lunch, and from your laziness on not putting it in the &lsquo;Pasta for Pennies&rsquo; jar at school.</p><p>He looked at one particularly rusted one and looked at it funny, &ldquo;In God We Trust? Liberty? 1964?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;1964!?&rdquo; You questioned happily snatching the small coin from his hands looking at the year with a bright smile on your face. </p><p>&ldquo;This was 55 years ago!&rdquo; You said putting it back in your wallet &ldquo;Ariani&rsquo;s gonna love this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What does all of it mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip; In God We Trust is there because my country was partly founded on the fact that everyone wanted to follow their own religion. But it was a different branch of Christianity. So&hellip; In God We Trust. Liberty is French, for Freedom.&rdquo; You explained. &ldquo;And the number is the year it was made. So-&ldquo;</p><p>You picked up another coin and flipped it to look at the profile of Abraham Lincoln &ldquo;2003&rdquo; You said holding it up proudly. &ldquo;The year I was born!&rdquo;</p><p>Jon only nodded, trying to keep up with what you were saying about your money.</p><p>&ldquo;And the man?&rdquo;</p><p>You only smiled &ldquo;Our sixteenth president. Abraham Lincoln. He was shot and killed during a play.&rdquo; You said flipping the coin up in the air and catching it as it came down. </p><p>&ldquo;We could do the get to know me version? You ask a question and based on how personal it is we get to choose the amount coins we get from it. Person who has zero coins left gets asked one major personal question, and they can&rsquo;t say no. And we both have to answer the question.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon only nodded once more as you split up the coins in half. Half for him, half for yourself. </p><p>&ldquo;You start.&rdquo; You encouraged. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you a noble woman?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s two coins.&rdquo; </p><p>He looked at you and dug two out of his pile and tossing them across the bed.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; You answered putting the two into your pile. </p><p>You studied him, making a visual outline of his silhouette and saving it in the back of your mind.</p><p>&ldquo;You come from a noble family?&rdquo; You asked back, thinking he had forgotten the rules for a moment</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&bull;&bull;&bull;</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a>&nbsp;@<a href=\"https://strangerthingsholland.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">strangerthingsholland</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQcJ41Q73x6-KoyP-pxsiLQ\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQcJ41Q73x6-KoyP-pxsiLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@starkbelova</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m43S12MMFkIn9WZ9uwO5LgQ\" target=\"_blank\">@missminx1993</a>&nbsp;@<a href=\"https://blxkstar.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Milktea loser\" target=\"_blank\">blxkstar</a><br /></p></p>",

But the thick, black cotton was draped over your frame. You could feel it against your bare arms and neck. </p>\n</p>",

Normally he would have added a please, but this time he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>She freed her wrist from his strong embrace, but then she took off her underdress and she lifted the blanket up again. When her body touched his he couldn\u2019t fight his fatigue any longer, but Sansa draped his arm around her shoulders and curled up against his naked chest.</p><p>A smile spread across his face while he fell asleep. \u00a0</p>",

The adrenaline that had been rushing through his veins was gone now, just like the Night King and his army. The ice dragon he had been distracting so Arya could reach the Godswood and save them all had exploded right when he had feared that &nbsp;they had failed and lost. The deafening sounds of clattering swords and screaming soldiers that had kept him going had stilled and now there was nothing but silence.</p><p>&ldquo;Jon&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>He was still breathing.

He was too exhausted to focus on his surroundings and his mind was too tired to count the stairs they were climbing and the turns they were taking. He assumed she was bringing him to his chambers, but he wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Even though she had just survived a nightmare her voice sounded confident and friendly when she spoke to the servant in the room. &ldquo;I will take it from here. You deserve a good day of sleep after the night we&rsquo;ve had.&rdquo; She placed him on a wooden chair and her soft and delicate fingers started to take his clothes off. </p><p>He wanted to protest, wanted to tell her that she didn&rsquo;t have to do this, that there were more important issues to take care of, but he couldn&rsquo;t. His tongue and lips refused to form words and his muscles refused to move. He couldn&rsquo;t keep her from taking off his coat and his armour. He couldn&rsquo;t keep her from taking off hiss boots and his pants. And he also couldn&rsquo;t keep her from taking off his breeches. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; She wrapped an arm around his naked waist and helped him to get up from his chair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you.&rdquo; She lead him to a wooden bathtub and without really thinking about it he stepped in. </p><p>The water was pleasantly warm, just like the rest of the room, and he allowed himself to sink into it until it reached his chin. His skin started glowing due to the clash of the cold and the heat, but the tingle all over his body reminded him that he was still alive. </p><p>&ldquo;Jon?&rdquo; Sansa kneeled down next to the tub. Her usually neat hairdo was now a mess and she had stripped down to her underdress. Her blue eyes however were reflecting the glow of the burning fire in the hearth. &ldquo;I will wash away the blood and dirt, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>He wanted to shake his head. He wanted to nod. He wanted to tell her that he could wash himself, but he knew he couldn&rsquo;t. Instead he simply closed his eyes when she pressed the warm cloth to his cheek. </p><p>Her touch was soft and firm at once. First she washed his face. Then she cleaned his shoulders and chest. She moved on to his legs and feet and a soft chuckle escaped when she pressed the tip of the cloth between his toes. </p><p>He had never known a touch could be this pleasant.</p><p>&ldquo;The Maester will have to check your wounds tomorrow. The cuts seem superficial.&rdquo; She washed his abdomen and then the cloth went between his thighs.</p><p>His entire body responded. He felt a shiver of the pleasant kind rolling down his spine, his heart beat faster and faster in his aching chest and in the back of his mind a little voice screamed for more. But he wasn&rsquo;t capable of more right now. He wasn&rsquo;t even capable of talking and telling her what he really wanted and longed for.</p><p>Too quickly his entire body was cleaned and the moment was over.</p><p>Once more she wrapped an arm around his waist and helped him to stand up. She didn&rsquo;t complain that he was soaking her dress. She didn&rsquo;t say that he was heavy. She helped him stepping out of the cooling water and once he was seated on his wooden chair again she reached for a towel. With the same care and precision as she had washed him she now dried every inch of his skin.
