Exiting the cozy alcove in the corner of the library in my family&rsquo;s mansion I made my way toward my sister scowling at the skirts and corset of my gown, so different from the tunics and pants I usually wore, mother had insisted I wear this bright pink monstrosity of tulle, gossamer and silk to greet the fae royalty visiting our estate to establish trading ties with my father I was confused as to why they would want to do that Prythian had always been more prosperous than the human lands and the court which was visiting puzzled me too, while we had minimum contact with the fae counterpart of our lands even I had heard stories of the high Lord of night&rsquo;s court and his &lsquo;reign of terror&rsquo;, the stories painted him as ruthless, brutal and powerful- I was pulled out of my musings by my sister snapping her fingers in front of my face </p><p>&ldquo;Hello, did u even hear what I said?&rdquo; she asked</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry&rdquo; I replied &ldquo;I was just thinking about something.&rdquo; </p><p>She rolled her eyes and told me to come downstairs quick or we would be late to greet the guests. We hurried down the stairs and saw our parents and other sister elain already waiting in the overtly opulent parlor. My mother glanced at me her blue grey eyes- eyes Nesta and I had inherited from her- flashing with disapproval &ldquo;Would it kill you to be on time for once?&rdquo; she said coldly I bit my tongue to hold back my less than appropriate response instead saying &ldquo;I was in the library reading and lost track of time, besides it hardly matters they&rsquo;re not even here yet.&rdquo; She opened her mouth, probably to reprimand me for not simply apologizing and letting it go when our house keeper Hazelle came forward and informed us that our guests had arrived. Quickly my family&rsquo;s demeanor changed, my mother&rsquo;s face so disapproving a second ago morphed into a smile, my father sat up straighter before giving me a brief smile to show me that HE  was on my side, Elain smoothed the skirts of her sunflower yellow dress and Nesta held her head high and stared straight at the door. I nervously fingered my lapiz lazuli pendant, a gift my grandmother had given me 17 years ago on my first birthday it was beautiful- the blue stone set in a delicate silver oval with little tendrils of silver on the edges. Then the door opened to admit in two large muscled winged males both with hazel eyes and shoulder length hair, they were both extremely handsome but then all the fae are. Before I could observe them properly my attention was caught by the two females entering the room one of them with long golden curls and brown eyes the color of freshly tilled soil was the most beautiful woman- or rather female- I had ever seen and beside her was a short petite femlae with poker straight, chin length inky black hair and quicksilver eyes, a chill went down my spine when I spotted her some deep, intrinsic part of me screaming at me to be wary of her, of the power I could see glimmering in her eyes. Before I could think about the scary and if I was being honest fascinating female the last member of their part entered the room and my heart stopped as I as gazed at devastatingly perfect features of the male I knew by the power roiling of him in waves by the wisps of dark emanating from him that was the high Lord. He looked at me with those remarkable violet eyes glimmering with what looked like stars, a few strands of his blue black hair brushing his eyebrows and smirked.</p>",
