Is it possible that Viserys sells male Dany to, say, buy an army, so male Dany becomes a slave himself and knows what it's like to be sold. Idk but it seems like an interesting contrast if Viserys and Dany were both boys, but they both turned out completely different.",
        "answer": "<p>You can see my posts on genderswapped Jon under <a href=\"http://nobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com/tagged/jonna%20snow\">this tag</a>.</p><p>For genderswapped Dany, I really have no idea what his life would have been like after a certain point. The birth and the escape from Dragonstone to Braavos would be the same. (Though not certain of the name - maybe \u201cDaeron\u201d in memory of the good king who united Westeros? but Rhaella already had a son named Daeron who died, and there are no male \u201cDaen\u201d Targ names we know of. I guess I\u2019ll stick with Danny, ugh.) After Willem Darry died, Viserys certainly would have taken care of a little brother if charged to do so, but without the thought they\u2019d marry one day, of course, so perhaps there\u2019d be more resentment and less brief flashes of love.
