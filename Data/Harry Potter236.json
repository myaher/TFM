Of course he knew he was risking his life if he went on the mission, but he had risked his life so many times, it kind of lost meaning after a while. </p><p>Sirius Black had felt alive that night. Finally out of Grimmauld Place, he was doing what he was born to do: fight. He was fighting for his godson, his dead brother, his lost friends, for the better world he dreamt of before the dementors had sucked his happiness out. </p><p>Sirius Black was afraid. His cousin Bellatrix was not an easy contender, and he knew in his heart that being related would only make this a harder fight. He was not willing to kill, but had no doubt that Bella would.</p><p>Sirius Black laughed loudly. It was his coping mechanism, to laugh in the darkest of times. To humor his way out of trouble. It is not surprising that he died as he lived, with an easy, exhilarated smile on his face. </p><p>Sirius Black fell through the veil. He did not hear the last words from Bellatrix\u2019s mouth, nor did he see the green light. He was falling, falling, falling, through the air, and through the veil. Once he hit the veil he braced himself for the hard floor. </p><p>Sirius Black landed comfortably. He was in the arms of-who else?- James Potter. The messy black hair, the easy smile that mirrored his own, the hazel eyes he knew so well was exactly as he remembered, and also exactly as how he had first seen them when they were eleven-year-olds on the Hogwarts Express. </p><p>Sirius Black wept. Standing next to James, they saw what was happening beyond the veil. His sweet godson was running towards him. How he wanted to reach out and greet him, but Sirius already knew the veil was a one-way entry. His promises of taking place of Lily and James, of being there as a friend, a guardian, a confidante burned his eyes, squeezed his heart, and became a hot lump in his throat.
