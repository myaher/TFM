How I ache for your next word,\nwhen we are gone from one another, even now \u2013 I do like Paris immensely, but\nher embrace is a paltry ghost of yours, my love, and I should have your arms\nabout me once more, as soon as my work here is done.</p><p>Mr Fell and Mr Crowley are\nvisiting here, and Mr Fell tells me when I send my letter that he\u2019ll do his\nstrange bit of working on the parchment of my envelope \u2013 I know not what it is\nhe does, nor what connections he draws upon, but he has a way of ensuring no\nletter is opened and read, nor even looked at strangely, as it makes its way\nupon its journey, except by its intended recipient. Is that not strange? I\nthink it marvellously so, but such is the way of Mr Fell, as long as it has\nbeen. He is the proprietor of that bookshop, you know the one, with those two\nfloors, and the spiral staircase that has hanging baskets hanging from its\nevery step, hosting such splendid, viridian plants? Strawberries grow from that\nstair come springtime, you know, and it is owing to Anthony\u2019s \u2013 that is to say,\nMr Crowley\u2019s, but the spirit does rebel at calling him Mr overmuch, for one\ngets the sense that he is smug about such things \u2013 paternal care of the things,\nfor he waters them and feeds them, and I thought for such a time that he spoke\nto them as some men do, but Mr Fells tells me that actually, he whispers to\nthem vile threats.</p><p>Oh, I do hope you remember them,\nGinger \u2013 you\u2019ve met them in passing each twice before, but my remarks will make\nso little sense if you\u2019ve forgotten them. Mr Fell \u2013 Ezra the name he gives,\nalthough his initials are A.Z. \u2013 is a portly fellow some ways shorter than me,\nwith round cheeks and eyes that are the hue of the sea in a watercolour\npainting (you know, husband, what I mean, I hope? That sort of blue-green,\nrendered dainty by the sun?), and he has blond hair that is lank but somehow\nrather charming, long strands that he draws back from his face. He wears\nspectacles, at times, these crescent-shaped things on golden frames that do\nnaught to encourage a youthful reading of his features, but those features are,\nI will assure you, most well-preserved \u2013 the only lines that show on him are\nthe happy crinkles at his eyes, and the furrow in his brow he gets when he\nreads, which is, of course, very often. He keeps such wonderful hands, you\nknow, and he has taught me all a manicurist would never. Mr Crowley is a tall\nfellow, gangling in an infuriatingly graceful manner, and with such a handsome\nface that upon meeting him, one is usually agog for a few moments before one\nremembers that, much as he looks as one, he isn\u2019t an artistic exhibit \u2013 it\u2019s\nquite strange, you know, for often I find myself finding in his features some\ncurious dimple or movement of the face I have seen in a painting or a sculpture\nof which I am fond, and yet how his face moves, how expressionate it is! Oh, he\nis handsome, Ginger, but in the most uncanny way, so much so that it does\nrather unsettle one, if one lingers on the thought too often. He is possessed\nof rather too much muscle, which clings to his skinny frame as if he is packing\nit to smuggle, and he always wears these sunglasses, for he is possessed of a\nstrange condition of the eye. Dark hair, always windswept, but in a somewhat dashing\nway.</p><p>Reading this back, I rather worry\nit seems I might be in love with Anthony, but you must understand he is quite\nunbearable, and a wreck of nerves, besides his marriage to Mr Fell, and while\nhe is handsome, that handsomeness is strange and eldritch, in its way, as if it\nought perhaps be locked away rather than cooed over, as is my usual wont.</p><p>Oh, Ginger, you do remember them,\nyou must.</p><p>In any case, I am taken away with\nthem in turns. They are so dreadfully in love, and it makes me pang for the\nwant of you, so far from me, you know. I don\u2019t believe I have ever seen a pair\nof souls so utterly bound up with one another, and it rather takes me away to\nsee them: they rather treat me as if I am some beloved nephew of theirs, or\nperhaps a son they have recently come into possession of, although this has\nalways been their manner with me. I rather think that this is Mr Fell\u2019s manner\nwith every young fellow of a certain bent, if you take my meaning, for he is a\ngreat patron of the Hyacinth and Vine, that gentlemen\u2019s club on Portland Place,\nand I rather think he oft has his angel\u2019s wings spread out for young gay\nfellows to gather under, as if he is an umbrella against the coming storm. He is\nan angel, in many a way, and so too is his husband: I cannot name a time where\nwe came into contact and he did not bail me out of some spot of trouble, and\nAnthony is so cruel to policemen, he must be a saint to all with a heart in\ndefiance of the law. I should be rather seduced by religion, if the figures\nwere a bit more like Mr Fell and his young beau, and less with all this\nbusiness with priests and sacraments and so on.</p><p>In any case, I think often on you,\nwhen I see them together.</p><p>Oh, my love, to think that we\nmight be like that, at one time, together, bound up forever. It is in the way\nthey treat each other, you see, in the little soft mannerisms of a life together.</p><p>I asked Mr Fell how they met, and\nhe said to me, \u201cOh, well, you know, it was\u2026 We were both working, and I was guarding\nthe door, er, I suppose I was a receptionist, or something, something like\nthat, and Anthony, he\u2019d done something a bit thick, you know, as is his way. And\nhe sort of crept up to me and rather startled me, but he accosted me with the\nmost enticing small talk \u2013 you know, dear boy, about the work, but about the\nweather, and about philosophy\u2026 And it was beginning to rain, so I put out my\u2014\nWe shared an umbrella, and you know, fiendish creature that he is, he came so\nmuch closer than he needed to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you love him,\u201d I asked, \u201ceven\nthen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d he said, and his watery\neyes seemed to sparkle with seafoam, and for a moment I fancied he was a\nthousand years away from me, frolicking in some place with Anthony in his arms.\n\u201cOh, yes, dear boy, I always rather did.\u201d</p><p>Oh, they are so superbly in love\nwith one another that it makes one most angry at them. They seem so happy, do\nyou know? One must hate those who are so deeply happy that they find themselves\nquite unconcerned with the happiness of others\u2026 </p><p>I have watched Mr Fell with\nAnthony, and oh, how he besets upon him: he fusses over his clothes and his\nhair, reaches up to comb it properly, or to adjust his tie or the set of his\nwaistcoat. Several times, I have watched him reach over to remove things from Anthony\u2019s\npockets, and use them as casually as he might use his own; he always orders the\nwine, for Anthony knows little about such things, and he tells Anthony the\nhistory of every bottle he touches, and Anthony looks at him with his lips\nparted and such devotion painted on his face, and surely in his eyes, although\nI could not see them to judge by. He often asks Anthony if he is too cold,\nalthough the weather here is very fine, and sometimes I believe Anthony says\nyes merely that Mr Fell will fuss over him, and fuss he does: he will draw off\nhis own jacket or his scarf and set it about Anthony\u2019s shoulders, and draw him\nclose to embrace him, that he might share the heat of his body! I don\u2019t know\nthat I have ever seen a fellow cup another man\u2019s cheek with such tenderness as\nMr Fell cups Anthony\u2019s, nor seen a man lean so gracefully into another\u2019s palm,\nthat he might bestow a kiss upon his wrist.</p><p>I asked Anthony how they met, and\nhe told me, \u201cWell, the first time, it was in this garden, and it was\u2026 You\ncouldn\u2019t imagine it, this garden, but it was beautiful. Verdant, luscious, with\nfruit heavy in the trees and flowers in a meadow on the ground, and I\u2019d had the\nworst of days, the worst day that had ever been, so far \u2013 that I\u2019d ever had,\ner, I mean, that I\u2019d ever had \u2013 and I looked at him at the gate and he just\nlooked so\u2026\u201d He took off his sunglasses, presently, and laid them upon his\nthigh, and I saw his eyes, which are so very serpentine, when one sees them\nlike this \u2013 they are a sort of bright yellow, and the pupil has some manner of\ncoloboma, or something like it, so that on each side they are rather like the eyes\nof a cat, or a snake. Now, they were misted with memory. \u201cHe\u2019s never been\nhandsome, you know. Not\u2026 Not like you think of it, he\u2019s not that sort of man.\nEven if you put a handsome face on him, he\u2019d <i>make</i> it less handsome, just by living in it, you know? But I looked\nat him, and I thought, oh, don\u2019t you fit in with all this fruit, and all this\ngrass, and all these flowers? Aren\u2019t you a juicy, delicious thing, waiting to\nbe plucked and eaten, and then I got closer, and I\u2026 Miles, young man\u2014\u201d (He\noften calls me <i>young man</i>, although I\ndon\u2019t know that I am so much younger than he is, and yet at times I think he is\nunutterably old and merely hides the evidence from his face.) \u201cHave you ever\nseen a fruit on a tree, and it looked so perfect, just the right colour, with the\nlight hitting it right, and so perfectly ripe you couldn\u2019t bear to pull it\ndown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHe was like that,\u201d Anthony said,\nand he looked so immensely happy that I nearly burst into tears.</p><p>Oh, if Mr Fell pays his court to\nAnthony, now, although they\u2019ve been happily together such years, he pays it\nback a thousandfold. You should see the way he dotes on this fellow, pays for\neverything, but the way he looks at Mr Fell as if he is the world and a half, as\nif he is so immensely beautiful and wonderful and perfect, and he says it all!</p><p>He calls him \u201cangel\u201d and whispers\nin his ear, and brings him such gifts and presents, and kisses him and touches\nhim, holds his hands and kisses his knuckles\u2026 He orders his meals, you know,\nand he eats so little, Mr Crowley, but he always orders desert for himself and\nonly eats a bite, and then slides the rest over to Mr Fell so that he might\nhave two, and isn\u2019t that the most darling thing you\u2019ve ever heard? Isn\u2019t it so\nawfully lovely?</p><p>Oh, my heart is full of them,\nGinger \u2013 I wish I could be similarly full of you. </p><p>Do write me soon, my dearest, my\nonly one, for my heart longs for your handsome hand upon the page (almost as\nmuch as I long for it in my own).</p><p>Yours (and only yours, always),</p><p>Miles</p>",

He is the proprietor of that bookshop, you know the one, with those two\nfloors, and the spiral staircase that has hanging baskets hanging from its\nevery step, hosting such splendid, viridian plants? Strawberries grow from that\nstair come springtime, you know, and it is owing to Anthony\u2019s \u2013 that is to say,\nMr Crowley\u2019s, but the spirit does rebel at calling him Mr overmuch, for one\ngets the sense that he is smug about such things \u2013 paternal care of the things,\nfor he waters them and feeds them, and I thought for such a time that he spoke\nto them as some men do, but Mr Fells tells me that actually, he whispers to\nthem vile threats.</p><p>Oh, I do hope you remember them,\nGinger \u2013 you\u2019ve met them in passing each twice before, but my remarks will make\nso little sense if you\u2019ve forgotten them. Mr Fell \u2013 Ezra the name he gives,\nalthough his initials are A.Z. \u2013 is a portly fellow some ways shorter than me,\nwith round cheeks and eyes that are the hue of the sea in a watercolour\npainting (you know, husband, what I mean, I hope? That sort of blue-green,\nrendered dainty by the sun?), and he has blond hair that is lank but somehow\nrather charming, long strands that he draws back from his face. He wears\nspectacles, at times, these crescent-shaped things on golden frames that do\nnaught to encourage a youthful reading of his features, but those features are,\nI will assure you, most well-preserved \u2013 the only lines that show on him are\nthe happy crinkles at his eyes, and the furrow in his brow he gets when he\nreads, which is, of course, very often. He keeps such wonderful hands, you\nknow, and he has taught me all a manicurist would never. Mr Crowley is a tall\nfellow, gangling in an infuriatingly graceful manner, and with such a handsome\nface that upon meeting him, one is usually agog for a few moments before one\nremembers that, much as he looks as one, he isn\u2019t an artistic exhibit \u2013 it\u2019s\nquite strange, you know, for often I find myself finding in his features some\ncurious dimple or movement of the face I have seen in a painting or a sculpture\nof which I am fond, and yet how his face moves, how expressionate it is! Oh, he\nis handsome, Ginger, but in the most uncanny way, so much so that it does\nrather unsettle one, if one lingers on the thought too often. He is possessed\nof rather too much muscle, which clings to his skinny frame as if he is packing\nit to smuggle, and he always wears these sunglasses, for he is possessed of a\nstrange condition of the eye. Dark hair, always windswept, but in a somewhat dashing\nway.</p><p>Reading this back, I rather worry\nit seems I might be in love with Anthony, but you must understand he is quite\nunbearable, and a wreck of nerves, besides his marriage to Mr Fell, and while\nhe is handsome, that handsomeness is strange and eldritch, in its way, as if it\nought perhaps be locked away rather than cooed over, as is my usual wont.</p><p>Oh, Ginger, you do remember them,\nyou must.</p><p>In any case, I am taken away with\nthem in turns. They are so dreadfully in love, and it makes me pang for the\nwant of you, so far from me, you know. I don\u2019t believe I have ever seen a pair\nof souls so utterly bound up with one another, and it rather takes me away to\nsee them: they rather treat me as if I am some beloved nephew of theirs, or\nperhaps a son they have recently come into possession of, although this has\nalways been their manner with me. I rather think that this is Mr Fell\u2019s manner\nwith every young fellow of a certain bent, if you take my meaning, for he is a\ngreat patron of the Hyacinth and Vine, that gentlemen\u2019s club on Portland Place,\nand I rather think he oft has his angel\u2019s wings spread out for young gay\nfellows to gather under, as if he is an umbrella against the coming storm. He is\nan angel, in many a way, and so too is his husband: I cannot name a time where\nwe came into contact and he did not bail me out of some spot of trouble, and\nAnthony is so cruel to policemen, he must be a saint to all with a heart in\ndefiance of the law. I should be rather seduced by religion, if the figures\nwere a bit more like Mr Fell and his young beau, and less with all this\nbusiness with priests and sacraments and so on.</p><p>In any case, I think often on you,\nwhen I see them together.</p><p>Oh, my love, to think that we\nmight be like that, at one time, together, bound up forever. It is in the way\nthey treat each other, you see, in the little soft mannerisms of a life together.</p><p>I asked Mr Fell how they met, and\nhe said to me, \u201cOh, well, you know, it was\u2026 We were both working, and I was guarding\nthe door, er, I suppose I was a receptionist, or something, something like\nthat, and Anthony, he\u2019d done something a bit thick, you know, as is his way. And\nhe sort of crept up to me and rather startled me, but he accosted me with the\nmost enticing small talk \u2013 you know, dear boy, about the work, but about the\nweather, and about philosophy\u2026 And it was beginning to rain, so I put out my\u2014\nWe shared an umbrella, and you know, fiendish creature that he is, he came so\nmuch closer than he needed to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you love him,\u201d I asked, \u201ceven\nthen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d he said, and his watery\neyes seemed to sparkle with seafoam, and for a moment I fancied he was a\nthousand years away from me, frolicking in some place with Anthony in his arms.\n\u201cOh, yes, dear boy, I always rather did.\u201d</p><p>Oh, they are so superbly in love\nwith one another that it makes one most angry at them. They seem so happy, do\nyou know? One must hate those who are so deeply happy that they find themselves\nquite unconcerned with the happiness of others\u2026 </p><p>I have watched Mr Fell with\nAnthony, and oh, how he besets upon him: he fusses over his clothes and his\nhair, reaches up to comb it properly, or to adjust his tie or the set of his\nwaistcoat. Several times, I have watched him reach over to remove things from Anthony\u2019s\npockets, and use them as casually as he might use his own; he always orders the\nwine, for Anthony knows little about such things, and he tells Anthony the\nhistory of every bottle he touches, and Anthony looks at him with his lips\nparted and such devotion painted on his face, and surely in his eyes, although\nI could not see them to judge by. He often asks Anthony if he is too cold,\nalthough the weather here is very fine, and sometimes I believe Anthony says\nyes merely that Mr Fell will fuss over him, and fuss he does: he will draw off\nhis own jacket or his scarf and set it about Anthony\u2019s shoulders, and draw him\nclose to embrace him, that he might share the heat of his body! I don\u2019t know\nthat I have ever seen a fellow cup another man\u2019s cheek with such tenderness as\nMr Fell cups Anthony\u2019s, nor seen a man lean so gracefully into another\u2019s palm,\nthat he might bestow a kiss upon his wrist.</p><p>I asked Anthony how they met, and\nhe told me, \u201cWell, the first time, it was in this garden, and it was\u2026 You\ncouldn\u2019t imagine it, this garden, but it was beautiful. Verdant, luscious, with\nfruit heavy in the trees and flowers in a meadow on the ground, and I\u2019d had the\nworst of days, the worst day that had ever been, so far \u2013 that I\u2019d ever had,\ner, I mean, that I\u2019d ever had \u2013 and I looked at him at the gate and he just\nlooked so\u2026\u201d He took off his sunglasses, presently, and laid them upon his\nthigh, and I saw his eyes, which are so very serpentine, when one sees them\nlike this \u2013 they are a sort of bright yellow, and the pupil has some manner of\ncoloboma, or something like it, so that on each side they are rather like the eyes\nof a cat, or a snake. Now, they were misted with memory. \u201cHe\u2019s never been\nhandsome, you know. Not\u2026 Not like you think of it, he\u2019s not that sort of man.\nEven if you put a handsome face on him, he\u2019d <i>make</i> it less handsome, just by living in it, you know? But I looked\nat him, and I thought, oh, don\u2019t you fit in with all this fruit, and all this\ngrass, and all these flowers? Aren\u2019t you a juicy, delicious thing, waiting to\nbe plucked and eaten, and then I got closer, and I\u2026 Miles, young man\u2014\u201d (He\noften calls me <i>young man</i>, although I\ndon\u2019t know that I am so much younger than he is, and yet at times I think he is\nunutterably old and merely hides the evidence from his face.) \u201cHave you ever\nseen a fruit on a tree, and it looked so perfect, just the right colour, with the\nlight hitting it right, and so perfectly ripe you couldn\u2019t bear to pull it\ndown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHe was like that,\u201d Anthony said,\nand he looked so immensely happy that I nearly burst into tears.</p><p>Oh, if Mr Fell pays his court to\nAnthony, now, although they\u2019ve been happily together such years, he pays it\nback a thousandfold. You should see the way he dotes on this fellow, pays for\neverything, but the way he looks at Mr Fell as if he is the world and a half, as\nif he is so immensely beautiful and wonderful and perfect, and he says it all!</p><p>He calls him \u201cangel\u201d and whispers\nin his ear, and brings him such gifts and presents, and kisses him and touches\nhim, holds his hands and kisses his knuckles\u2026 He orders his meals, you know,\nand he eats so little, Mr Crowley, but he always orders desert for himself and\nonly eats a bite, and then slides the rest over to Mr Fell so that he might\nhave two, and isn\u2019t that the most darling thing you\u2019ve ever heard? Isn\u2019t it so\nawfully lovely?</p><p>Oh, my heart is full of them,\nGinger \u2013 I wish I could be similarly full of you. </p><p>Do write me soon, my dearest, my\nonly one, for my heart longs for your handsome hand upon the page (almost as\nmuch as I long for it in my own).</p><p>Yours (and only yours, always),</p><p>Miles</p></p>",
