Today Cyrus is spending some quality time with his dad and stepmother whilst TJ is occupied with some of his basketball friends.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus is currently out to lunch with his parents\u00a0at some fancy vegan restaurant even though none of them embrace that lifestyle full-time.\u00a0Cyrus is poking at the chickpeas in his salad when his phone buzzes. Normally his parents would scold this but his father and stepmother were too engaged in their own conversation to notice him pull his cell out of his pocket.</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 smile widens when he sees it\u2019s a text message from TJ.\u00a0<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1138\" data-orig-height=\"962\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c284cba0f77c4130695a556b692c4f0a/tumblr_inline_pew33888G61unll6l_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1138\" data-orig-height=\"962\"/></figure><p>Cyrus laughs quietly to himself at TJ\u2019s broken heart emoji reply.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s got you so happy?\u201d Sharon coaxes her head with a raised brow.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Cyrus says defensively,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just TJ.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOh, TJ,\u201d Sharon bops her head,\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s the tall one you\u2019ve been spending time with?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Cyrus laughs nervously and he\u2019s not entirely sure why.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s babysitting his brother and sister tonight and asked if I wanted to stay over. Is that okay?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cA sleepover?\u201d Cyrus\u2019 father, Norman poses it like a question,\u00a0\u201cYou haven\u2019t had a sleepover with a friend since the girls were little.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThanks for the reminder, dad.\u201d Cyrus mumbles to himself and he reflects on the time he became aware that boy/girl sleepovers were not considered normal and it ultimately making him feel like the odd one out in their friendship.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWell I don\u2019t see why not.\u201d Norman nods with a smile,\u00a0\u201cYou be sure to thank his parents when you see them and extend the same offer to TJ. I can\u2019t speak for your mom and Todd but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s just as welcome at their house anytime.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Cyrus finishes up with his parents and goes home to pack an overnight bag before Sharon gives him a lift to TJ\u2019s apartment building.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus had been here before, depending on what they were doing for the day it was quicker for Cyrus to walk by TJ\u2019s apartment first when leaving from - or going home to - his mom\u2019s house but it was a bit further from his dad\u2019s. Although he\u2019d been here before Cyrus had never actually been inside which wasn\u2019t too odd to Cyrus because TJ had only popped inside Cyrus\u2019 house a couple times when hanging out, to use the bathroom or grab a drink quickly before they moved on to whatever activity they had planned next.\u00a0</p><p>Although they had gotten comfortable with each other over the end of the school year and a lot closer in the first few weeks of summer the two had never had a sleepover before and it was making Cyrus anxious. He hadn\u2019t had a sleepover - other than the occasional cousin sleepover during family gatherings - \u00a0since he was 10 years old and even back then it was with his two female best friends. Cyrus didn\u2019t know what to expect from a boys night, especially since he knew he didn\u2019t favour a lot of\u00a0\u2018typical\u2019 male interests. This was evident at how out of place Cyrus could feel when trying to impress Jonah.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus stands out front of the building and texts TJ to let him know he\u2019s waiting downstairs but after a few minutes pass and his text goes unanswered, Cyrus steps up to the intercom and calls the room listed under Kippen.\u00a0</p><p>A woman Cyrus assumes is TJ\u2019s mother answers, Cyrus had\u00a0never actually met TJ\u2019s parents despite TJ having met all four of his at either his bash mitzvah or in passing during one of the times they\u2019ve hung out over the summer.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus makes his way up to the second floor and wraps his knuckles on the door that reads\u00a0\u20182A\u2019. \u00a0A little girl answers, Cyrus knows this to be TJ\u2019s little sister as he had seen TJ tagged in a photo with his younger siblings on facebook.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Cyrus.\u201d He smiles at her,\u00a0\u201cTJ\u2019s friend.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cKatie, you\u2019re not supposed to answer the door.\u201d A woman comes jogging into view.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou said he could come up.\u201d She refers to the intercom call.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re<i> still </i>not supposed to open the door.\u201d She says firmly and Cyrus sensed the woman was a little frazzled over something.\u00a0\u201cNow go tell you brother, Cyrus is here.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>With a pout she runs off down the hall. TJ\u2019s mother turns to Cyrus with a wide smile and introduces herself as Tess before leading him towards the kitchen. She\u2019s speaking quickly as they walk but Cyrus managed to decipher what she was talking about. Tess was expressing how it was nice to finally meet Cyrus after hearing so much about him, especially over the summer.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you too, Mrs. Kippen.\u201d Cyrus returns the sentiment politely.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Ms. and Tess is just fine thank you.\u201d She corrects kindly.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Cyrus smiles and nods. He didn\u2019t know TJ\u2019s parent\u2019s weren&rsquo;t together but after thinking about it for a moment Cyrus realised TJ didn\u2019t talk about his family much at all and when he did, he didn\u2019t talk about his father ever.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m in a bit of a rush to get ready for work.\u201d Tess apologises.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s alright.\u201d Cyrus hovers by as she flits around the kitchen and he was quietly hoping TJ would surface soon.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cJunior!\u201d Tess calls out for TJ and Cyrus lets the faintest laugh escape before he stifles it quickly. \u201cHe\u2019s always got his headphones on.\u201d\u00a0Tess turns to Cyrus with a sigh.\u00a0</p><p>Katie skips into the kitchen and Tess gives her attention to the young girl, \u201cKatie I thought I asked you to get TJ?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou told me to tell my brother Cyrus is here, so I told Cooper.\u201d She laughs devilishly and Cyrus cracks a smile at this.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cTake Cyrus to TJ\u2019s room please,\u201d Tess lets out a deflated breath.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Katie grabs Cyrus\u2019 hand and drags him down the hall, the gesture made Cyrus\u2019 heart ache with cuteness overload.\u00a0</p><p>Katie barges into TJ\u2019s room without knocking and Cyrus is dragged along in the process.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTeej, your friend is here!\u201d Katie says loudly and she drops her hold of Cyrus\u2019 hand.\u00a0</p><p>A very surprised TJ flicks the headphones off his ears and stops whatever he was doing at his desk.\u00a0\u201cCyrus?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus is confused by the sight for a second, TJ was at his desk, a mess of loose papers scattered across it, rounded glasses perched up high on the bridge of his nose.\u00a0All Cyrus can respond with is, \u201cYou wear glasses?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0TJ sheepishly plucks them from his face and throws them at the desk.<br/></p><p>\u201cHe does.\u201d Katie says and TJ tells her to scram.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with wearing glasses.\u201d Cyrus says once they\u2019re alone,\u00a0\u201cI just had no idea you wore them.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I wear contacts in public.\u201d TJ mumbles.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Cyrus picks up the frames from TJ\u2019s desk and holds them close to his eyes, the blurred vision it gave Cyrus was like an instant headache,\u00a0\u201cOh my god.\u201d Cyrus chuckles as he puts them back down,\u00a0\u201cCan you even see right now without these?\u201d He laughs.\u00a0</p><p>TJ folds his arms like an embarrassed child. Even though TJ knew Cyrus wasn\u2019t making fun of him, he was still shy about it.\u00a0\u201cYou got here quickly.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been two hours since you texted me.\u201d Cyrus states.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d TJ looks at the time on his phone and his missed text from Cyrus earlier pops up.<br/></p><p>\u201cYour mom let me up.\u201d Cyrus smiles.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cSorry, I guess I got caught up with my studying.\u201d TJ apologises.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cStudying in summer?\u201d Cyrus questions.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI see a special tutor once a week for my\u00a0dyscalculia, it\u2019s supposed to help me catch up before school starts again.\u201d TJ is sheepish.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Cyrus smiles encouragingly and he genuinely felt proud that TJ was working with his learning disability rather than fighting against it.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou can put your bag down wherever,\u201d TJ stands from his desk chair.<br/></p><p>Cyrus drops his overnight bag from his shoulder and places it by the bunkbed in the room.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI have to share a room with Cooper since Katie\u2019s going to be a girl one day and want her privacy.\u201d TJ rolls his eyes.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a girl now?\u201d Cyrus looks confused.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s 7 and still wants to hang around her brothers all the time.\u201d TJ laughs,\u00a0\u201cShe didn\u2019t even want to stop sharing a room with Coop but mom says she\u2019ll change her mind soon enough.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s anything like Buffy and Andi, she\u2019ll be about 10.\u201d Cyrus says mindlessly as he looks around TJ\u2019s room, taking in the surroundings.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s when their parents got weird about our friendship.\u201d Cyrus\u2019 gaze lands back on TJ.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s kinda small but we can hang in the living room tonight once the twins go to bed.\u201d TJ smiles weakly. He was doing that thing where you talk down what you have because you\u2019re embarrassed and Cyrus didn\u2019t like that very much at all.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI like it.\u201d Cyrus says with a smile. It was a small room with a single bunkbed pressed against one wall, a desk on the other side of the room by the door and a bookshelf opposite the closet. The little details were what caught Cyrus\u2019 eye. The mesh of TJ\u2019s stuff with Cooper\u2019s. Some were immediately easier to differentiate and others not so much. Like the sports memorabilia, Cyrus assumed it belonged to TJ, along with the shelf of trophies and ribbons from basketball and other athletic accomplishments whilst a few scattered toys seemed to belong to Cooper. It was a few comic and science themed things that didn\u2019t immediately make sense to Cyrus.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Teej.</i>\u201d\u00a0Tess\u2019s voice bellows from the kitchen and\u00a0TJ motions for them to go find out what she wants.\u00a0</p><p>Once in the kitchen the two boys plant themselves on a bench stool each and Tess announces that she\u2019s leaving.\u00a0Cyrus immediately notices the scrubs she\u2019s changed into. It makes Cyrus remember something TJ had said casually in conversation about his mother being a nurse.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know the drill, if you go out the kids go with you, no further than the park and in before sun down.\u201d Tess looks to TJ.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYes mom, I know.\u201d TJ nods.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd lights out by 8.\u201d Tess gently wiggles her finger in front of her sons face,\u00a0\u201cLast night you kept them both up after 10.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhich on of them ratted on me?\u201d TJ glares.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNeither of them had to. They both slept in later than me and I\u2019m the one working overnights.\u201d Tess gives him a knowing look.\u00a0\u201cNow, I left money for pizza in the top drawer and there is a few extra dollars for one side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d TJ nods and watches his mother flit about the room in a rush, \u201cYou\u2019re running late you better hurry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cKeys?\u201d Tess looks to him as she pats her non existent pockets.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Vegetable drawer in the fridge.\u201d TJ says casually although Cyrus understandably registers this as odd.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Katie.</i>\u201d Tess says with a sigh as she retrieves her car keys from exactly where TJ said they\u2019d be.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cShe likes to hide things,\u201d TJ turns to Cyrus with an explanation,\u00a0\u201cI saw her put them in there after lunch.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Cyrus lets out a quiet chuckle and a few questions about that came to mind, like for starters, why? Also, why didn\u2019t TJ take them out if he saw her put them there?</p><p>\u201cOh, and\u00a0remember to sort out your dirty laundry,\u201d Tess says as she slings her handbag over her shoulder,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve been asking for two days now, Junior!\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>Mom.</i>\u201d TJ lets out an embarrassed grumble.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry, Teej.\u201d Tess smiles sympathetically.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWant to embarrass me anymore in front of my friend or are you ready to go to work now?\u201d TJ tries to fake being angry at his mom but his efforts are fooled with a sweet smile.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Tess challenges TJ\u2019s remark and gives him a big smooch on the cheek. Immediately TJ wipes at where she marked him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd take a shower, you smell terrible.\u201d Tess says with a crinkled nose.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Mom!</i>\u201d TJ gives her a look, this time he wasn&rsquo;t smiling.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019m going,\u201d Tess laughs,\u00a0\u201cCyrus, it was lovely to meet you, sorry I\u2019m such a hurry.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s alright Ms- Uh- Tess,\u201d Cyrus corrects himself with a smile,\u00a0\u201cHave a nice night at work.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Tess finally leaves after popping her head into the living room to say see you later to the twins.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s such a mess when she gets called in for extra shifts.\u201d TJ shakes his head with a chuckle. He stands from his stool and goes to the fridge.\u00a0<br/></p><p>&quot;I like her,\u201d Cyrus says positively,\u00a0\u201cWith my accident prone ways I think having a nurse for a parent would be far more beneficial than four shrink parents,\u201d Cyrus half jokes,\u00a0\u201cAll that does is make me think I\u2019m crazy.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ closes the fridge with a quiet chuckle.\u00a0\u201cI bet it makes you analyse other people a lot too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus tosses his head from side to side,\u00a0\u201cTrue.. but I\u2019m almost never right with my assumptions.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cScary basketball guy.\u201d TJ motions to himself before he\u00a0retrieves two glasses from an overhead cupboard and proceeds to pour them both a juice.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Cyrus laughs softly.<br/></p><p>\u201cOh and for the record,\u201d TJ pushes one glass towards Cyrus,\u00a0\u201c\u00a0\u2018<i>Junior\u2019,\u00a0</i>doesn\u2019t leave this room. I <i>hate </i>when my mom calls me that.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Cyrus bites down on a smile,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s funny because of how tall you are.\u201d Cyrus chuckles.\u00a0\u201cI mean I knew the \u2018J\u2019\u00a0in your name stood for Junior but you don\u2019t look like a Junior to me. It doesn\u2019t fit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know it stood for that?\u201d TJ questions.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI found it in the yearbook.\u201d Cyrus recalls stumbling upon it when searching for Buffy\u2019s crush.\u00a0</p><p>TJ lets out a groan. \u201cI forgot they put my full name in there.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNow \u2018Teej\u2019 on the other hand,\u201d Cyrus takes a sip from his glass,\u00a0\u201cI like that a lot more, I\u2019m going to start using it.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>TJ crinkles his nose at Cyrus\u2019 affirmation\u00a0although he does not protest against it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo I was looking at the list earlier and I thought of a few things we could check off it.\u201d TJ says after skulling his entire glass of juice in one go.<br/></p><p>\u201cTonight?\u201d Cyrus questions.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, why not be productive with this babysitting session,\u201d TJ laughs.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019ll be fun.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay, what tasks?\u201d Cyrus asks.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cMake a basket, watch a scary movie and stay up for 24 hours.\u201d TJ lists.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Cyrus curls his facial expression into pure dread.\u00a0\u201cThat\u00a0doesn\u2019t sound fun.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cToo bad.\u201d\u00a0TJ does his signature pout and smirk combo,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve been avoiding\u00a0\u2018make a basket\u2019 since I added it to the list last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah but wasn\u2019t laser tag <i>so</i> much more fun instead?\u201d Cyrus deflects.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIt was pretty fun,\u201d TJ admits but he shakes his head and returns to his point,\u00a0\u201cThere is a court behind the building, I say we go now whilst it\u2019s still light out.\u201d<br/></p><p>Reluctantly Cyrus agrees and TJ goes to the living room to round up his siblings.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCome on we\u2019re going down to the court.\u201d TJ instructs.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Katie happily jumps up from her place on the sofa whilst Cooper seemed even more reluctant about the idea than Cyrus.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo I have to come?\u201d Cooper mumbles and it was evident he was uncomfortable around Cyrus.<br/></p><p>\u201cLast time I went downstairs and left you up here alone you set the kitchen on fire and mom grounded me for a week.\u201d TJ folds his arms.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d Cooper says quietly and admits defeat quickly. Cooper leaves to get a book to take down and TJ leans into Cyrus to make sure his brother didn\u2019t hear him when he explained that Cooper was really shy.\u00a0</p><p>After TJ retrieves a basketball, the four make their way downstairs and out onto the small court behind TJ\u2019s apartment building, it was late afternoon but there is still plenty of sun left for the day. Katie and Cooper sit on a bench seat by the court together whilst TJ takes the lead with this active task from the list.\u00a0</p><p>TJ playfully dribbles the ball around Cyrus and makes a basket whilst\u00a0Cyrus turns his body to follow TJ and remains firm that his ability on the court was embarrassing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou make it look so easy.\u201d Cyrus folds his arms as TJ retrieves the ball,\u00a0\u201cI hate that.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>TJ pretends to hand the ball to Cyrus but turns quickly and makes another shot instead.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re just showing off.\u201d Cyrus glares.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI was already showing off before.\u201d TJ shrugs with a smirk.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay we get it, you\u2019re the basketball guy,\u201d Cyrus waves his hands about,\u00a0\u201cNow are you going to teach me or what?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYes Sir.\u201d TJ laughs at Cyrus\u2019 mood swing.\u00a0<br/></p><p>TJ uses his basketball captain ways to teach Cyrus a little technique with his stance and hold of the ball before moving on to tips for the actual throw itself.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus fails a few times, they\u2019re\u00a0horrible attempts at first but he did manage to get a little better. Although he was getting better, TJ could tell Cyrus lacked enthusiasm about this particular task. Even though he was not enthusiastic, the boys still had their usual amount of fun with it.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus breaks his failed attempts to show TJ how he likes to shoot basketballs, where he stands under the net and throws it up but it comes back down and smacks him in the face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUnderdog are you okay?\u201d TJ winces and jogs over to his friend.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah I\u2019m fine,\u201d Cyrus gently rubs his nose where the ball collided,\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t even throw the ball hard enough to injure myself.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou make not being hurt sound like a bad thing.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAt least I\u2019d know then that I was making progress.\u201d Cyrus sighs.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou are making progress.\u201d TJ assures as he slaps a hand to Cyrus\u2019 shoulder,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve got it this time,<i> I can feel it</i>.\u201d TJ says as he picks up the ball and hands it to Cyrus.\u00a0\u201cDeep breath, I believe in you.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDo I have to?\u201d Cyrus pouts.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cLast try for the day, I promise.\u201d TJ says,\u00a0\u201cIf you don\u2019t make this one we\u2019ll try again another day.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Cyrus is doubtful but takes the ball and goes to the free throw line. If failing one more time was all he had to do to stop for the day, then he might as well get it over with.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus pauses and looks to TJ who has gone over with the twins. Katie seemed enthralled in his efforts whilst Cooper didn\u2019t lift his gaze from his book.\u00a0TJ holds Cyrus\u2019 eye contact and nods encouragingly.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus holds the ball out in front of himself and takes a deep breath. <i>You got this&hellip;</i></p><p>\u201cYou can do it, Cyrus!\u201d Katie cheers encouragingly and Cyrus sends her a thankful smile before turning his attention back to the hoop.<br/></p><p>With another deep breath, Cyrus moves himself into position like TJ had showed him. Then he counts back from three in his head and throws the ball. Cyrus watches as it effortlessly falls through the hoop.</p><p>\u201cCan we go inside no-\u201d Cyrus stops once he processes what just happened.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Katie is squealing with glee and TJ has a huge grin plastered on his face whilst his arms are thrown up in the air excitedly. Even Cooper wore a hint of an impressed expression on his face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDid I just?\u201d Cyrus turns to TJ.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou did it!\u201d TJ rushes over to him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI did it.\u201d Cyrus laughs in disbelief.\u00a0<br/></p><p>After a moment of celebration TJ jokingly suggests they play a little one on one.</p><p>\u201cI wanna play!\u201d Katie is with them and she jumps up and down.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou two can play, I need to quit whilst I\u2019m ahead.\u201d Cyrus laughs.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cBoo!\u201d Katie whines and TJ mimics with a cute\u00a0\u2018boo\u2019 of his own.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Cyrus gives in quickly,\u00a0\u201cBut we\u2019re going to need someone else to play so we\u2019re even teams.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>The three standing on the court turn their gazes to Cooper who is looking at them with confusion.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Cooper mumbles almost too quiet for them to hear from where they stand.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cCome on, Coop, it\u2019ll be fun.\u201d TJ says.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, Coop,<i> please</i>?\u201d Katie begs.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou can be on my team.\u201d Cyrus smiles,\u00a0\u201cI know that\u2019s an unconvincing argument but I\u2019ll let you in on a little secret,\u201d Cyrus covers his mouth on the side closest to TJ, as if he were actually telling a secret but he speaks at his usual volume,\u00a0\u201cTJ lets me win a lot.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI do not!\u201d TJ says defensively.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou do so,\u201d Cyrus laughs,\u00a0\u201cYou think it will make me feel better about sucking at everything.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t suck at everything, you just don\u2019t even try sometimes.\u201d TJ folds his arms.\u00a0<br/></p><p>&quot;You still let me win to boost my confidence.\u201d Cyrus smiles.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m certainly not going easy on you with this game.\u201d TJ states.\u00a0\u201cWinner gets to choose the side we order for dinner.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOo, high stakes!\u201d Cyrus wriggles his brows as he turns back to Cooper,\u00a0\u201cWhat do you say?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Cooper still looks a little reluctant but agrees with a quiet sigh. Once they\u2019re all ready to play TJ declares that the first to three wins.\u00a0</p><p>A goofy game gets underway and plenty of standard rules were broken, one of them was the way Katie just runs with the ball. At one point Cyrus noticed TJ purposely fumble his catch so Cooper could get a go with the ball. The two older boys exchange a look after this, Cyrus\u2019 was knowing like he was right about TJ letting them win and TJ just innocently shrugs and pretends like he didnt know why Cyrus was looking at him.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Once Katie gets the ball again, TJ picks her up and sits her on his shoulders so she can make a basket.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cheating!\u201d Cooper exclaims, by this point in the game he had loosened up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNu-uh,\u201d TJ says in a childish way.\u00a0\u201cThis is no rules basketball!\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Cyrus looks like they\u2019ve been dealt a great injustice before realising he can cleverly use this to his advantage,\u00a0\u201cIf I spin around three times really fast and touch my toes that\u2019s worth infinity points and ends the game early.\u201d Cyrus does just as he mentioned and excitedly exclaims,\u00a0\u201cGame over we win!\u201d Cyrus turns to Cooper excitedly with a high-five.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no fun.\u201d TJ laughs and Katie, still on TJ\u2019s shoulders folds her arms in a huff.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m just smarter and evidently a better basketball player.\u201d Cyrus jokes and he stretches down to touch his toes again.\u00a0\u201cDouble infinity points to us.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>TJ rolls his eyes with a smile,\u00a0\u201cOkay kids lets hit the showers,\u201d TJ claps his hands together and points up towards their building.</p><p>TJ looks to Cyrus with a smile slowly creeping wider on his face. Cyrus coaxes his head with a sigh as he anticipated what TJ was about to say next.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll race ya!\u201d TJ bounces on his toes before quickly racing towards the building, Katie and Coop following his fast lead.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cStop making me run all the time!\u201d Cyrus whines as he lags behind the Kippen kids.\u00a0<br/></p><p>[<a href=\"http://seriestrash.tumblr.com/post/178426206730/the-list-chapter-six\">Next Chapter</a>]<br/></p><hr><p><b>End Notes:\u00a0</b>Thanks to everyone who left me comments on the last chapter!

Today Cyrus is spending some quality time with his dad and stepmother whilst TJ is occupied with some of his basketball friends.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus is currently out to lunch with his parents\u00a0at some fancy vegan restaurant even though none of them embrace that lifestyle full-time.\u00a0Cyrus is poking at the chickpeas in his salad when his phone buzzes. Normally his parents would scold this but his father and stepmother were too engaged in their own conversation to notice him pull his cell out of his pocket.</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 smile widens when he sees it\u2019s a text message from TJ.\u00a0<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1138\" data-orig-height=\"962\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c284cba0f77c4130695a556b692c4f0a/tumblr_inline_pew33888G61unll6l_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1138\" data-orig-height=\"962\"></figure><p>Cyrus laughs quietly to himself at TJ\u2019s broken heart emoji reply.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s got you so happy?\u201d Sharon coaxes her head with a raised brow.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Cyrus says defensively,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just TJ.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOh, TJ,\u201d Sharon bops her head,\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s the tall one you\u2019ve been spending time with?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Cyrus laughs nervously and he\u2019s not entirely sure why.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s babysitting his brother and sister tonight and asked if I wanted to stay over. Is that okay?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cA sleepover?\u201d Cyrus\u2019 father, Norman poses it like a question,\u00a0\u201cYou haven\u2019t had a sleepover with a friend since the girls were little.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThanks for the reminder, dad.\u201d Cyrus mumbles to himself and he reflects on the time he became aware that boy/girl sleepovers were not considered normal and it ultimately making him feel like the odd one out in their friendship.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell I don\u2019t see why not.\u201d Norman nods with a smile,\u00a0\u201cYou be sure to thank his parents when you see them and extend the same offer to TJ. I can\u2019t speak for your mom and Todd but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s just as welcome at their house anytime.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus finishes up with his parents and goes home to pack an overnight bag before Sharon gives him a lift to TJ\u2019s apartment building.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus had been here before, depending on what they were doing for the day it was quicker for Cyrus to walk by TJ\u2019s apartment first when leaving from - or going home to - his mom\u2019s house but it was a bit further from his dad\u2019s. Although he\u2019d been here before Cyrus had never actually been inside which wasn\u2019t too odd to Cyrus because TJ had only popped inside Cyrus\u2019 house a couple times when hanging out, to use the bathroom or grab a drink quickly before they moved on to whatever activity they had planned next.\u00a0</p><p>Although they had gotten comfortable with each other over the end of the school year and a lot closer in the first few weeks of summer the two had never had a sleepover before and it was making Cyrus anxious. He hadn\u2019t had a sleepover - other than the occasional cousin sleepover during family gatherings - \u00a0since he was 10 years old and even back then it was with his two female best friends. Cyrus didn\u2019t know what to expect from a boys night, especially since he knew he didn\u2019t favour a lot of\u00a0\u2018typical\u2019 male interests. This was evident at how out of place Cyrus could feel when trying to impress Jonah.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus stands out front of the building and texts TJ to let him know he\u2019s waiting downstairs but after a few minutes pass and his text goes unanswered, Cyrus steps up to the intercom and calls the room listed under Kippen.\u00a0</p><p>A woman Cyrus assumes is TJ\u2019s mother answers, Cyrus had\u00a0never actually met TJ\u2019s parents despite TJ having met all four of his at either his bash mitzvah or in passing during one of the times they\u2019ve hung out over the summer.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus makes his way up to the second floor and wraps his knuckles on the door that reads\u00a0\u20182A\u2019. \u00a0A little girl answers, Cyrus knows this to be TJ\u2019s little sister as he had seen TJ tagged in a photo with his younger siblings on facebook.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Cyrus.\u201d He smiles at her,\u00a0\u201cTJ\u2019s friend.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cKatie, you\u2019re not supposed to answer the door.\u201d A woman comes jogging into view.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou said he could come up.\u201d She refers to the intercom call.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re<i> still </i>not supposed to open the door.\u201d She says firmly and Cyrus sensed the woman was a little frazzled over something.\u00a0\u201cNow go tell you brother, Cyrus is here.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>With a pout she runs off down the hall. TJ\u2019s mother turns to Cyrus with a wide smile and introduces herself as Tess before leading him towards the kitchen. She\u2019s speaking quickly as they walk but Cyrus managed to decipher what she was talking about. Tess was expressing how it was nice to finally meet Cyrus after hearing so much about him, especially over the summer.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you too, Mrs. Kippen.\u201d Cyrus returns the sentiment politely.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Ms. and Tess is just fine thank you.\u201d She corrects kindly.\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus smiles and nods. He didn\u2019t know TJ\u2019s parent\u2019s weren\u2019t together but after thinking about it for a moment Cyrus realised TJ didn\u2019t talk about his family much at all and when he did, he didn\u2019t talk about his father ever.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m in a bit of a rush to get ready for work.\u201d Tess apologises.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s alright.\u201d Cyrus hovers by as she flits around the kitchen and he was quietly hoping TJ would surface soon.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cJunior!\u201d Tess calls out for TJ and Cyrus lets the faintest laugh escape before he stifles it quickly. \u201cHe\u2019s always got his headphones on.\u201d\u00a0Tess turns to Cyrus with a sigh.\u00a0</p><p>Katie skips into the kitchen and Tess gives her attention to the young girl, \u201cKatie I thought I asked you to get TJ?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou told me to tell my brother Cyrus is here, so I told Cooper.\u201d She laughs devilishly and Cyrus cracks a smile at this.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cTake Cyrus to TJ\u2019s room please,\u201d Tess lets out a deflated breath.\u00a0<br></p><p>Katie grabs Cyrus\u2019 hand and drags him down the hall, the gesture made Cyrus\u2019 heart ache with cuteness overload.\u00a0</p><p>Katie barges into TJ\u2019s room without knocking and Cyrus is dragged along in the process.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTeej, your friend is here!\u201d Katie says loudly and she drops her hold of Cyrus\u2019 hand.\u00a0</p><p>A very surprised TJ flicks the headphones off his ears and stops whatever he was doing at his desk.\u00a0\u201cCyrus?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus is confused by the sight for a second, TJ was at his desk, a mess of loose papers scattered across it, rounded glasses perched up high on the bridge of his nose.\u00a0All Cyrus can respond with is, \u201cYou wear glasses?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0TJ sheepishly plucks them from his face and throws them at the desk.<br></p><p>\u201cHe does.\u201d Katie says and TJ tells her to scram.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with wearing glasses.\u201d Cyrus says once they\u2019re alone,\u00a0\u201cI just had no idea you wore them.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I wear contacts in public.\u201d TJ mumbles.\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus picks up the frames from TJ\u2019s desk and holds them close to his eyes, the blurred vision it gave Cyrus was like an instant headache,\u00a0\u201cOh my god.\u201d Cyrus chuckles as he puts them back down,\u00a0\u201cCan you even see right now without these?\u201d He laughs.\u00a0</p><p>TJ folds his arms like an embarrassed child. Even though TJ knew Cyrus wasn\u2019t making fun of him, he was still shy about it.\u00a0\u201cYou got here quickly.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been two hours since you texted me.\u201d Cyrus states.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d TJ looks at the time on his phone and his missed text from Cyrus earlier pops up.<br></p><p>\u201cYour mom let me up.\u201d Cyrus smiles.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSorry, I guess I got caught up with my studying.\u201d TJ apologises.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cStudying in summer?\u201d Cyrus questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI see a special tutor once a week for my\u00a0dyscalculia, it\u2019s supposed to help me catch up before school starts again.\u201d TJ is sheepish.\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus smiles encouragingly and he genuinely felt proud that TJ was working with his learning disability rather than fighting against it.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou can put your bag down wherever,\u201d TJ stands from his desk chair.<br></p><p>Cyrus drops his overnight bag from his shoulder and places it by the bunkbed in the room.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI have to share a room with Cooper since Katie\u2019s going to be a girl one day and want her privacy.\u201d TJ rolls his eyes.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a girl now?\u201d Cyrus looks confused.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s 7 and still wants to hang around her brothers all the time.\u201d TJ laughs,\u00a0\u201cShe didn\u2019t even want to stop sharing a room with Coop but mom says she\u2019ll change her mind soon enough.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s anything like Buffy and Andi, she\u2019ll be about 10.\u201d Cyrus says mindlessly as he looks around TJ\u2019s room, taking in the surroundings.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s when their parents got weird about our friendship.\u201d Cyrus\u2019 gaze lands back on TJ.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s kinda small but we can hang in the living room tonight once the twins go to bed.\u201d TJ smiles weakly. He was doing that thing where you talk down what you have because you\u2019re embarrassed and Cyrus didn\u2019t like that very much at all.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI like it.\u201d Cyrus says with a smile. It was a small room with a single bunkbed pressed against one wall, a desk on the other side of the room by the door and a bookshelf opposite the closet. The little details were what caught Cyrus\u2019 eye. The mesh of TJ\u2019s stuff with Cooper\u2019s. Some were immediately easier to differentiate and others not so much. Like the sports memorabilia, Cyrus assumed it belonged to TJ, along with the shelf of trophies and ribbons from basketball and other athletic accomplishments whilst a few scattered toys seemed to belong to Cooper. It was a few comic and science themed things that didn\u2019t immediately make sense to Cyrus.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Teej.</i>\u201d\u00a0Tess\u2019s voice bellows from the kitchen and\u00a0TJ motions for them to go find out what she wants.\u00a0</p><p>Once in the kitchen the two boys plant themselves on a bench stool each and Tess announces that she\u2019s leaving.\u00a0Cyrus immediately notices the scrubs she\u2019s changed into. It makes Cyrus remember something TJ had said casually in conversation about his mother being a nurse.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know the drill, if you go out the kids go with you, no further than the park and in before sun down.\u201d Tess looks to TJ.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYes mom, I know.\u201d TJ nods.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd lights out by 8.\u201d Tess gently wiggles her finger in front of her sons face,\u00a0\u201cLast night you kept them both up after 10.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhich on of them ratted on me?\u201d TJ glares.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNeither of them had to. They both slept in later than me and I\u2019m the one working overnights.\u201d Tess gives him a knowing look.\u00a0\u201cNow, I left money for pizza in the top drawer and there is a few extra dollars for one side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d TJ nods and watches his mother flit about the room in a rush, \u201cYou\u2019re running late you better hurry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cKeys?\u201d Tess looks to him as she pats her non existent pockets.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cVegetable drawer in the fridge.\u201d TJ says casually although Cyrus understandably registers this as odd.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Katie.</i>\u201d Tess says with a sigh as she retrieves her car keys from exactly where TJ said they\u2019d be.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cShe likes to hide things,\u201d TJ turns to Cyrus with an explanation,\u00a0\u201cI saw her put them in there after lunch.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus lets out a quiet chuckle and a few questions about that came to mind, like for starters, why? Also, why didn\u2019t TJ take them out if he saw her put them there?</p><p>\u201cOh, and\u00a0remember to sort out your dirty laundry,\u201d Tess says as she slings her handbag over her shoulder,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve been asking for two days now, Junior!\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>Mom.</i>\u201d TJ lets out an embarrassed grumble.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry, Teej.\u201d Tess smiles sympathetically.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWant to embarrass me anymore in front of my friend or are you ready to go to work now?\u201d TJ tries to fake being angry at his mom but his efforts are fooled with a sweet smile.\u00a0<br></p><p>Tess challenges TJ\u2019s remark and gives him a big smooch on the cheek. Immediately TJ wipes at where she marked him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd take a shower, you smell terrible.\u201d Tess says with a crinkled nose.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Mom!</i>\u201d TJ gives her a look, this time he wasn\u2019t smiling.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019m going,\u201d Tess laughs,\u00a0\u201cCyrus, it was lovely to meet you, sorry I\u2019m such a hurry.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s alright Ms- Uh- Tess,\u201d Cyrus corrects himself with a smile,\u00a0\u201cHave a nice night at work.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Tess finally leaves after popping her head into the living room to say see you later to the twins.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s such a mess when she gets called in for extra shifts.\u201d TJ shakes his head with a chuckle. He stands from his stool and goes to the fridge.\u00a0<br></p><p>\"I like her,\u201d Cyrus says positively,\u00a0\u201cWith my accident prone ways I think having a nurse for a parent would be far more beneficial than four shrink parents,\u201d Cyrus half jokes,\u00a0\u201cAll that does is make me think I\u2019m crazy.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ closes the fridge with a quiet chuckle.\u00a0\u201cI bet it makes you analyse other people a lot too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus tosses his head from side to side,\u00a0\u201cTrue.. but I\u2019m almost never right with my assumptions.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cScary basketball guy.\u201d TJ motions to himself before he\u00a0retrieves two glasses from an overhead cupboard and proceeds to pour them both a juice.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Cyrus laughs softly.<br></p><p>\u201cOh and for the record,\u201d TJ pushes one glass towards Cyrus,\u00a0\u201c\u00a0\u2018<i>Junior\u2019,\u00a0</i>doesn\u2019t leave this room. I <i>hate </i>when my mom calls me that.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus bites down on a smile,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s funny because of how tall you are.\u201d Cyrus chuckles.\u00a0\u201cI mean I knew the \u2018J\u2019\u00a0in your name stood for Junior but you don\u2019t look like a Junior to me. It doesn\u2019t fit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know it stood for that?\u201d TJ questions.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI found it in the yearbook.\u201d Cyrus recalls stumbling upon it when searching for Buffy\u2019s crush.\u00a0</p><p>TJ lets out a groan. \u201cI forgot they put my full name in there.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNow \u2018Teej\u2019 on the other hand,\u201d Cyrus takes a sip from his glass,\u00a0\u201cI like that a lot more, I\u2019m going to start using it.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ crinkles his nose at Cyrus\u2019 affirmation\u00a0although he does not protest against it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo I was looking at the list earlier and I thought of a few things we could check off it.\u201d TJ says after skulling his entire glass of juice in one go.<br></p><p>\u201cTonight?\u201d Cyrus questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, why not be productive with this babysitting session,\u201d TJ laughs.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019ll be fun.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay, what tasks?\u201d Cyrus asks.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMake a basket, watch a scary movie and stay up for 24 hours.\u201d TJ lists.\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus curls his facial expression into pure dread.\u00a0\u201cThat\u00a0doesn\u2019t sound fun.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cToo bad.\u201d\u00a0TJ does his signature pout and smirk combo,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve been avoiding\u00a0\u2018make a basket\u2019 since I added it to the list last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah but wasn\u2019t laser tag <i>so</i> much more fun instead?\u201d Cyrus deflects.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt was pretty fun,\u201d TJ admits but he shakes his head and returns to his point,\u00a0\u201cThere is a court behind the building, I say we go now whilst it\u2019s still light out.\u201d<br></p><p>Reluctantly Cyrus agrees and TJ goes to the living room to round up his siblings.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCome on we\u2019re going down to the court.\u201d TJ instructs.\u00a0<br></p><p>Katie happily jumps up from her place on the sofa whilst Cooper seemed even more reluctant about the idea than Cyrus.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo I have to come?\u201d Cooper mumbles and it was evident he was uncomfortable around Cyrus.<br></p><p>\u201cLast time I went downstairs and left you up here alone you set the kitchen on fire and mom grounded me for a week.\u201d TJ folds his arms.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d Cooper says quietly and admits defeat quickly. Cooper leaves to get a book to take down and TJ leans into Cyrus to make sure his brother didn\u2019t hear him when he explained that Cooper was really shy.\u00a0</p><p>After TJ retrieves a basketball, the four make their way downstairs and out onto the small court behind TJ\u2019s apartment building, it was late afternoon but there is still plenty of sun left for the day. Katie and Cooper sit on a bench seat by the court together whilst TJ takes the lead with this active task from the list.\u00a0</p><p>TJ playfully dribbles the ball around Cyrus and makes a basket whilst\u00a0Cyrus turns his body to follow TJ and remains firm that his ability on the court was embarrassing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou make it look so easy.\u201d Cyrus folds his arms as TJ retrieves the ball,\u00a0\u201cI hate that.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ pretends to hand the ball to Cyrus but turns quickly and makes another shot instead.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re just showing off.\u201d Cyrus glares.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI was already showing off before.\u201d TJ shrugs with a smirk.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOkay we get it, you\u2019re the basketball guy,\u201d Cyrus waves his hands about,\u00a0\u201cNow are you going to teach me or what?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYes Sir.\u201d TJ laughs at Cyrus\u2019 mood swing.\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ uses his basketball captain ways to teach Cyrus a little technique with his stance and hold of the ball before moving on to tips for the actual throw itself.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus fails a few times, they\u2019re\u00a0horrible attempts at first but he did manage to get a little better. Although he was getting better, TJ could tell Cyrus lacked enthusiasm about this particular task. Even though he was not enthusiastic, the boys still had their usual amount of fun with it.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus breaks his failed attempts to show TJ how he likes to shoot basketballs, where he stands under the net and throws it up but it comes back down and smacks him in the face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUnderdog are you okay?\u201d TJ winces and jogs over to his friend.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah I\u2019m fine,\u201d Cyrus gently rubs his nose where the ball collided,\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t even throw the ball hard enough to injure myself.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou make not being hurt sound like a bad thing.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAt least I\u2019d know then that I was making progress.\u201d Cyrus sighs.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou are making progress.\u201d TJ assures as he slaps a hand to Cyrus\u2019 shoulder,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve got it this time,<i> I can feel it</i>.\u201d TJ says as he picks up the ball and hands it to Cyrus.\u00a0\u201cDeep breath, I believe in you.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDo I have to?\u201d Cyrus pouts.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cLast try for the day, I promise.\u201d TJ says,\u00a0\u201cIf you don\u2019t make this one we\u2019ll try again another day.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus is doubtful but takes the ball and goes to the free throw line. If failing one more time was all he had to do to stop for the day, then he might as well get it over with.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus pauses and looks to TJ who has gone over with the twins. Katie seemed enthralled in his efforts whilst Cooper didn\u2019t lift his gaze from his book.\u00a0TJ holds Cyrus\u2019 eye contact and nods encouragingly.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus holds the ball out in front of himself and takes a deep breath. <i>You got this\u2026</i></p><p>\u201cYou can do it, Cyrus!\u201d Katie cheers encouragingly and Cyrus sends her a thankful smile before turning his attention back to the hoop.<br></p><p>With another deep breath, Cyrus moves himself into position like TJ had showed him. Then he counts back from three in his head and throws the ball. Cyrus watches as it effortlessly falls through the hoop.</p><p>\u201cCan we go inside no-\u201d Cyrus stops once he processes what just happened.\u00a0<br></p><p>Katie is squealing with glee and TJ has a huge grin plastered on his face whilst his arms are thrown up in the air excitedly. Even Cooper wore a hint of an impressed expression on his face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDid I just?\u201d Cyrus turns to TJ.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou did it!\u201d TJ rushes over to him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI did it.\u201d Cyrus laughs in disbelief.\u00a0<br></p><p>After a moment of celebration TJ jokingly suggests they play a little one on one.</p><p>\u201cI wanna play!\u201d Katie is with them and she jumps up and down.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou two can play, I need to quit whilst I\u2019m ahead.\u201d Cyrus laughs.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cBoo!\u201d Katie whines and TJ mimics with a cute\u00a0\u2018boo\u2019 of his own.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Cyrus gives in quickly,\u00a0\u201cBut we\u2019re going to need someone else to play so we\u2019re even teams.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>The three standing on the court turn their gazes to Cooper who is looking at them with confusion.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Cooper mumbles almost too quiet for them to hear from where they stand.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cCome on, Coop, it\u2019ll be fun.\u201d TJ says.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, Coop,<i> please</i>?\u201d Katie begs.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou can be on my team.\u201d Cyrus smiles,\u00a0\u201cI know that\u2019s an unconvincing argument but I\u2019ll let you in on a little secret,\u201d Cyrus covers his mouth on the side closest to TJ, as if he were actually telling a secret but he speaks at his usual volume,\u00a0\u201cTJ lets me win a lot.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI do not!\u201d TJ says defensively.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou do so,\u201d Cyrus laughs,\u00a0\u201cYou think it will make me feel better about sucking at everything.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t suck at everything, you just don\u2019t even try sometimes.\u201d TJ folds his arms.\u00a0<br></p><p>\"You still let me win to boost my confidence.\u201d Cyrus smiles.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m certainly not going easy on you with this game.\u201d TJ states.\u00a0\u201cWinner gets to choose the side we order for dinner.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOo, high stakes!\u201d Cyrus wriggles his brows as he turns back to Cooper,\u00a0\u201cWhat do you say?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Cooper still looks a little reluctant but agrees with a quiet sigh. Once they\u2019re all ready to play TJ declares that the first to three wins.\u00a0</p><p>A goofy game gets underway and plenty of standard rules were broken, one of them was the way Katie just runs with the ball. At one point Cyrus noticed TJ purposely fumble his catch so Cooper could get a go with the ball. The two older boys exchange a look after this, Cyrus\u2019 was knowing like he was right about TJ letting them win and TJ just innocently shrugs and pretends like he didnt know why Cyrus was looking at him.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Once Katie gets the ball again, TJ picks her up and sits her on his shoulders so she can make a basket.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cheating!\u201d Cooper exclaims, by this point in the game he had loosened up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNu-uh,\u201d TJ says in a childish way.\u00a0\u201cThis is no rules basketball!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus looks like they\u2019ve been dealt a great injustice before realising he can cleverly use this to his advantage,\u00a0\u201cIf I spin around three times really fast and touch my toes that\u2019s worth infinity points and ends the game early.\u201d Cyrus does just as he mentioned and excitedly exclaims,\u00a0\u201cGame over we win!\u201d Cyrus turns to Cooper excitedly with a high-five.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no fun.\u201d TJ laughs and Katie, still on TJ\u2019s shoulders folds her arms in a huff.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m just smarter and evidently a better basketball player.\u201d Cyrus jokes and he stretches down to touch his toes again.\u00a0\u201cDouble infinity points to us.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ rolls his eyes with a smile,\u00a0\u201cOkay kids lets hit the showers,\u201d TJ claps his hands together and points up towards their building.</p><p>TJ looks to Cyrus with a smile slowly creeping wider on his face. Cyrus coaxes his head with a sigh as he anticipated what TJ was about to say next.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll race ya!\u201d TJ bounces on his toes before quickly racing towards the building, Katie and Coop following his fast lead.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cStop making me run all the time!\u201d Cyrus whines as he lags behind the Kippen kids.\u00a0<br></p><p>[<a href=\"http://seriestrash.tumblr.com/post/178426206730/the-list-chapter-six\">Next Chapter</a>]<br></p><hr><p><b>End Notes:\u00a0</b>Thanks to everyone who left me comments on the last chapter!

Today Cyrus is spending some quality time with his dad and stepmother whilst TJ is occupied with some of his basketball friends.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus is currently out to lunch with his parents\u00a0at some fancy vegan restaurant even though none of them embrace that lifestyle full-time.\u00a0Cyrus is poking at the chickpeas in his salad when his phone buzzes. Normally his parents would scold this but his father and stepmother were too engaged in their own conversation to notice him pull his cell out of his pocket.</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 smile widens when he sees it\u2019s a text message from TJ.\u00a0<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1138\" data-orig-height=\"962\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c284cba0f77c4130695a556b692c4f0a/tumblr_inline_pew33888G61unll6l_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1138\" data-orig-height=\"962\"></figure><p>Cyrus laughs quietly to himself at TJ\u2019s broken heart emoji reply.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s got you so happy?\u201d Sharon coaxes her head with a raised brow.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Cyrus says defensively,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just TJ.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOh, TJ,\u201d Sharon bops her head,\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s the tall one you\u2019ve been spending time with?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Cyrus laughs nervously and he\u2019s not entirely sure why.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s babysitting his brother and sister tonight and asked if I wanted to stay over. Is that okay?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cA sleepover?\u201d Cyrus\u2019 father, Norman poses it like a question,\u00a0\u201cYou haven\u2019t had a sleepover with a friend since the girls were little.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThanks for the reminder, dad.\u201d Cyrus mumbles to himself and he reflects on the time he became aware that boy/girl sleepovers were not considered normal and it ultimately making him feel like the odd one out in their friendship.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell I don\u2019t see why not.\u201d Norman nods with a smile,\u00a0\u201cYou be sure to thank his parents when you see them and extend the same offer to TJ. I can\u2019t speak for your mom and Todd but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s just as welcome at their house anytime.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus finishes up with his parents and goes home to pack an overnight bag before Sharon gives him a lift to TJ\u2019s apartment building.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus had been here before, depending on what they were doing for the day it was quicker for Cyrus to walk by TJ\u2019s apartment first when leaving from - or going home to - his mom\u2019s house but it was a bit further from his dad\u2019s. Although he\u2019d been here before Cyrus had never actually been inside which wasn\u2019t too odd to Cyrus because TJ had only popped inside Cyrus\u2019 house a couple times when hanging out, to use the bathroom or grab a drink quickly before they moved on to whatever activity they had planned next.\u00a0</p><p>Although they had gotten comfortable with each other over the end of the school year and a lot closer in the first few weeks of summer the two had never had a sleepover before and it was making Cyrus anxious. He hadn\u2019t had a sleepover - other than the occasional cousin sleepover during family gatherings - \u00a0since he was 10 years old and even back then it was with his two female best friends. Cyrus didn\u2019t know what to expect from a boys night, especially since he knew he didn\u2019t favour a lot of\u00a0\u2018typical\u2019 male interests. This was evident at how out of place Cyrus could feel when trying to impress Jonah.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus stands out front of the building and texts TJ to let him know he\u2019s waiting downstairs but after a few minutes pass and his text goes unanswered, Cyrus steps up to the intercom and calls the room listed under Kippen.\u00a0</p><p>A woman Cyrus assumes is TJ\u2019s mother answers, Cyrus had\u00a0never actually met TJ\u2019s parents despite TJ having met all four of his at either his bash mitzvah or in passing during one of the times they\u2019ve hung out over the summer.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus makes his way up to the second floor and wraps his knuckles on the door that reads\u00a0\u20182A\u2019. \u00a0A little girl answers, Cyrus knows this to be TJ\u2019s little sister as he had seen TJ tagged in a photo with his younger siblings on facebook.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Cyrus.\u201d He smiles at her,\u00a0\u201cTJ\u2019s friend.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cKatie, you\u2019re not supposed to answer the door.\u201d A woman comes jogging into view.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou said he could come up.\u201d She refers to the intercom call.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re<i> still </i>not supposed to open the door.\u201d She says firmly and Cyrus sensed the woman was a little frazzled over something.\u00a0\u201cNow go tell you brother, Cyrus is here.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>With a pout she runs off down the hall. TJ\u2019s mother turns to Cyrus with a wide smile and introduces herself as Tess before leading him towards the kitchen. She\u2019s speaking quickly as they walk but Cyrus managed to decipher what she was talking about. Tess was expressing how it was nice to finally meet Cyrus after hearing so much about him, especially over the summer.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you too, Mrs. Kippen.\u201d Cyrus returns the sentiment politely.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Ms. and Tess is just fine thank you.\u201d She corrects kindly.\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus smiles and nods. He didn\u2019t know TJ\u2019s parent\u2019s weren\u2019t together but after thinking about it for a moment Cyrus realised TJ didn\u2019t talk about his family much at all and when he did, he didn\u2019t talk about his father ever.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m in a bit of a rush to get ready for work.\u201d Tess apologises.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s alright.\u201d Cyrus hovers by as she flits around the kitchen and he was quietly hoping TJ would surface soon.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cJunior!\u201d Tess calls out for TJ and Cyrus lets the faintest laugh escape before he stifles it quickly. \u201cHe\u2019s always got his headphones on.\u201d\u00a0Tess turns to Cyrus with a sigh.\u00a0</p><p>Katie skips into the kitchen and Tess gives her attention to the young girl, \u201cKatie I thought I asked you to get TJ?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou told me to tell my brother Cyrus is here, so I told Cooper.\u201d She laughs devilishly and Cyrus cracks a smile at this.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cTake Cyrus to TJ\u2019s room please,\u201d Tess lets out a deflated breath.\u00a0<br></p><p>Katie grabs Cyrus\u2019 hand and drags him down the hall, the gesture made Cyrus\u2019 heart ache with cuteness overload.\u00a0</p><p>Katie barges into TJ\u2019s room without knocking and Cyrus is dragged along in the process.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTeej, your friend is here!\u201d Katie says loudly and she drops her hold of Cyrus\u2019 hand.\u00a0</p><p>A very surprised TJ flicks the headphones off his ears and stops whatever he was doing at his desk.\u00a0\u201cCyrus?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus is confused by the sight for a second, TJ was at his desk, a mess of loose papers scattered across it, rounded glasses perched up high on the bridge of his nose.\u00a0All Cyrus can respond with is, \u201cYou wear glasses?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0TJ sheepishly plucks them from his face and throws them at the desk.<br></p><p>\u201cHe does.\u201d Katie says and TJ tells her to scram.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with wearing glasses.\u201d Cyrus says once they\u2019re alone,\u00a0\u201cI just had no idea you wore them.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I wear contacts in public.\u201d TJ mumbles.\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus picks up the frames from TJ\u2019s desk and holds them close to his eyes, the blurred vision it gave Cyrus was like an instant headache,\u00a0\u201cOh my god.\u201d Cyrus chuckles as he puts them back down,\u00a0\u201cCan you even see right now without these?\u201d He laughs.\u00a0</p><p>TJ folds his arms like an embarrassed child. Even though TJ knew Cyrus wasn\u2019t making fun of him, he was still shy about it.\u00a0\u201cYou got here quickly.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been two hours since you texted me.\u201d Cyrus states.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d TJ looks at the time on his phone and his missed text from Cyrus earlier pops up.<br></p><p>\u201cYour mom let me up.\u201d Cyrus smiles.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSorry, I guess I got caught up with my studying.\u201d TJ apologises.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cStudying in summer?\u201d Cyrus questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI see a special tutor once a week for my\u00a0dyscalculia, it\u2019s supposed to help me catch up before school starts again.\u201d TJ is sheepish.\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus smiles encouragingly and he genuinely felt proud that TJ was working with his learning disability rather than fighting against it.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou can put your bag down wherever,\u201d TJ stands from his desk chair.<br></p><p>Cyrus drops his overnight bag from his shoulder and places it by the bunkbed in the room.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI have to share a room with Cooper since Katie\u2019s going to be a girl one day and want her privacy.\u201d TJ rolls his eyes.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a girl now?\u201d Cyrus looks confused.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s 7 and still wants to hang around her brothers all the time.\u201d TJ laughs,\u00a0\u201cShe didn\u2019t even want to stop sharing a room with Coop but mom says she\u2019ll change her mind soon enough.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s anything like Buffy and Andi, she\u2019ll be about 10.\u201d Cyrus says mindlessly as he looks around TJ\u2019s room, taking in the surroundings.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s when their parents got weird about our friendship.\u201d Cyrus\u2019 gaze lands back on TJ.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s kinda small but we can hang in the living room tonight once the twins go to bed.\u201d TJ smiles weakly. He was doing that thing where you talk down what you have because you\u2019re embarrassed and Cyrus didn\u2019t like that very much at all.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI like it.\u201d Cyrus says with a smile. It was a small room with a single bunkbed pressed against one wall, a desk on the other side of the room by the door and a bookshelf opposite the closet. The little details were what caught Cyrus\u2019 eye. The mesh of TJ\u2019s stuff with Cooper\u2019s. Some were immediately easier to differentiate and others not so much. Like the sports memorabilia, Cyrus assumed it belonged to TJ, along with the shelf of trophies and ribbons from basketball and other athletic accomplishments whilst a few scattered toys seemed to belong to Cooper. It was a few comic and science themed things that didn\u2019t immediately make sense to Cyrus.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Teej.</i>\u201d\u00a0Tess\u2019s voice bellows from the kitchen and\u00a0TJ motions for them to go find out what she wants.\u00a0</p><p>Once in the kitchen the two boys plant themselves on a bench stool each and Tess announces that she\u2019s leaving.\u00a0Cyrus immediately notices the scrubs she\u2019s changed into. It makes Cyrus remember something TJ had said casually in conversation about his mother being a nurse.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know the drill, if you go out the kids go with you, no further than the park and in before sun down.\u201d Tess looks to TJ.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYes mom, I know.\u201d TJ nods.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd lights out by 8.\u201d Tess gently wiggles her finger in front of her sons face,\u00a0\u201cLast night you kept them both up after 10.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhich on of them ratted on me?\u201d TJ glares.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNeither of them had to. They both slept in later than me and I\u2019m the one working overnights.\u201d Tess gives him a knowing look.\u00a0\u201cNow, I left money for pizza in the top drawer and there is a few extra dollars for one side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d TJ nods and watches his mother flit about the room in a rush, \u201cYou\u2019re running late you better hurry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cKeys?\u201d Tess looks to him as she pats her non existent pockets.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cVegetable drawer in the fridge.\u201d TJ says casually although Cyrus understandably registers this as odd.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Katie.</i>\u201d Tess says with a sigh as she retrieves her car keys from exactly where TJ said they\u2019d be.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cShe likes to hide things,\u201d TJ turns to Cyrus with an explanation,\u00a0\u201cI saw her put them in there after lunch.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus lets out a quiet chuckle and a few questions about that came to mind, like for starters, why? Also, why didn\u2019t TJ take them out if he saw her put them there?</p><p>\u201cOh, and\u00a0remember to sort out your dirty laundry,\u201d Tess says as she slings her handbag over her shoulder,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve been asking for two days now, Junior!\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>Mom.</i>\u201d TJ lets out an embarrassed grumble.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry, Teej.\u201d Tess smiles sympathetically.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWant to embarrass me anymore in front of my friend or are you ready to go to work now?\u201d TJ tries to fake being angry at his mom but his efforts are fooled with a sweet smile.\u00a0<br></p><p>Tess challenges TJ\u2019s remark and gives him a big smooch on the cheek. Immediately TJ wipes at where she marked him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd take a shower, you smell terrible.\u201d Tess says with a crinkled nose.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Mom!</i>\u201d TJ gives her a look, this time he wasn\u2019t smiling.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019m going,\u201d Tess laughs,\u00a0\u201cCyrus, it was lovely to meet you, sorry I\u2019m such a hurry.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s alright Ms- Uh- Tess,\u201d Cyrus corrects himself with a smile,\u00a0\u201cHave a nice night at work.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Tess finally leaves after popping her head into the living room to say see you later to the twins.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s such a mess when she gets called in for extra shifts.\u201d TJ shakes his head with a chuckle.

Cooper leaves to get a book to take down and TJ leans into Cyrus to make sure his brother didn\u2019t hear him when he explained that Cooper was really shy.\u00a0</p><p>After TJ retrieves a basketball, the four make their way downstairs and out onto the small court behind TJ\u2019s apartment building, it was late afternoon but there is still plenty of sun left for the day. Katie and Cooper sit on a bench seat by the court together whilst TJ takes the lead with this active task from the list.\u00a0</p><p>TJ playfully dribbles the ball around Cyrus and makes a basket whilst\u00a0Cyrus turns his body to follow TJ and remains firm that his ability on the court was embarrassing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou make it look so easy.\u201d Cyrus folds his arms as TJ retrieves the ball,\u00a0\u201cI hate that.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ pretends to hand the ball to Cyrus but turns quickly and makes another shot instead.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re just showing off.\u201d Cyrus glares.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI was already showing off before.\u201d TJ shrugs with a smirk.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOkay we get it, you\u2019re the basketball guy,\u201d Cyrus waves his hands about,\u00a0\u201cNow are you going to teach me or what?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYes Sir.\u201d TJ laughs at Cyrus\u2019 mood swing.\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ uses his basketball captain ways to teach Cyrus a little technique with his stance and hold of the ball before moving on to tips for the actual throw itself.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus fails a few times, they\u2019re\u00a0horrible attempts at first but he did manage to get a little better. Although he was getting better, TJ could tell Cyrus lacked enthusiasm about this particular task. Even though he was not enthusiastic, the boys still had their usual amount of fun with it.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus breaks his failed attempts to show TJ how he likes to shoot basketballs, where he stands under the net and throws it up but it comes back down and smacks him in the face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUnderdog are you okay?\u201d TJ winces and jogs over to his friend.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah I\u2019m fine,\u201d Cyrus gently rubs his nose where the ball collided,\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t even throw the ball hard enough to injure myself.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou make not being hurt sound like a bad thing.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAt least I\u2019d know then that I was making progress.\u201d Cyrus sighs.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou are making progress.\u201d TJ assures as he slaps a hand to Cyrus\u2019 shoulder,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve got it this time,<i> I can feel it</i>.\u201d TJ says as he picks up the ball and hands it to Cyrus.\u00a0\u201cDeep breath, I believe in you.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDo I have to?\u201d Cyrus pouts.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cLast try for the day, I promise.\u201d TJ says,\u00a0\u201cIf you don\u2019t make this one we\u2019ll try again another day.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus is doubtful but takes the ball and goes to the free throw line. If failing one more time was all he had to do to stop for the day, then he might as well get it over with.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus pauses and looks to TJ who has gone over with the twins. Katie seemed enthralled in his efforts whilst Cooper didn\u2019t lift his gaze from his book.\u00a0TJ holds Cyrus\u2019 eye contact and nods encouragingly.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus holds the ball out in front of himself and takes a deep breath. <i>You got this\u2026</i></p><p>\u201cYou can do it, Cyrus!\u201d Katie cheers encouragingly and Cyrus sends her a thankful smile before turning his attention back to the hoop.<br></p><p>With another deep breath, Cyrus moves himself into position like TJ had showed him. Then he counts back from three in his head and throws the ball. Cyrus watches as it effortlessly falls through the hoop.</p><p>\u201cCan we go inside no-\u201d Cyrus stops once he processes what just happened.\u00a0<br></p><p>Katie is squealing with glee and TJ has a huge grin plastered on his face whilst his arms are thrown up in the air excitedly. Even Cooper wore a hint of an impressed expression on his face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDid I just?\u201d Cyrus turns to TJ.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou did it!\u201d TJ rushes over to him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI did it.\u201d Cyrus laughs in disbelief.\u00a0<br></p><p>After a moment of celebration TJ jokingly suggests they play a little one on one.</p><p>\u201cI wanna play!\u201d Katie is with them and she jumps up and down.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou two can play, I need to quit whilst I\u2019m ahead.\u201d Cyrus laughs.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cBoo!\u201d Katie whines and TJ mimics with a cute\u00a0\u2018boo\u2019 of his own.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Cyrus gives in quickly,\u00a0\u201cBut we\u2019re going to need someone else to play so we\u2019re even teams.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>The three standing on the court turn their gazes to Cooper who is looking at them with confusion.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Cooper mumbles almost too quiet for them to hear from where they stand.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cCome on, Coop, it\u2019ll be fun.\u201d TJ says.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, Coop,<i> please</i>?\u201d Katie begs.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou can be on my team.\u201d Cyrus smiles,\u00a0\u201cI know that\u2019s an unconvincing argument but I\u2019ll let you in on a little secret,\u201d Cyrus covers his mouth on the side closest to TJ, as if he were actually telling a secret but he speaks at his usual volume,\u00a0\u201cTJ lets me win a lot.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI do not!\u201d TJ says defensively.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou do so,\u201d Cyrus laughs,\u00a0\u201cYou think it will make me feel better about sucking at everything.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t suck at everything, you just don\u2019t even try sometimes.\u201d TJ folds his arms.\u00a0<br></p><p>\"You still let me win to boost my confidence.\u201d Cyrus smiles.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m certainly not going easy on you with this game.\u201d TJ states.\u00a0\u201cWinner gets to choose the side we order for dinner.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOo, high stakes!\u201d Cyrus wriggles his brows as he turns back to Cooper,\u00a0\u201cWhat do you say?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Cooper still looks a little reluctant but agrees with a quiet sigh. Once they\u2019re all ready to play TJ declares that the first to three wins.\u00a0</p><p>A goofy game gets underway and plenty of standard rules were broken, one of them was the way Katie just runs with the ball. At one point Cyrus noticed TJ purposely fumble his catch so Cooper could get a go with the ball. The two older boys exchange a look after this, Cyrus\u2019 was knowing like he was right about TJ letting them win and TJ just innocently shrugs and pretends like he didnt know why Cyrus was looking at him.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Once Katie gets the ball again, TJ picks her up and sits her on his shoulders so she can make a basket.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cheating!\u201d Cooper exclaims, by this point in the game he had loosened up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNu-uh,\u201d TJ says in a childish way.\u00a0\u201cThis is no rules basketball!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus looks like they\u2019ve been dealt a great injustice before realising he can cleverly use this to his advantage,\u00a0\u201cIf I spin around three times really fast and touch my toes that\u2019s worth infinity points and ends the game early.\u201d Cyrus does just as he mentioned and excitedly exclaims,\u00a0\u201cGame over we win!\u201d Cyrus turns to Cooper excitedly with a high-five.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no fun.\u201d TJ laughs and Katie, still on TJ\u2019s shoulders folds her arms in a huff.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m just smarter and evidently a better basketball player.\u201d Cyrus jokes and he stretches down to touch his toes again.\u00a0\u201cDouble infinity points to us.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ rolls his eyes with a smile,\u00a0\u201cOkay kids lets hit the showers,\u201d TJ claps his hands together and points up towards their building.</p><p>TJ looks to Cyrus with a smile slowly creeping wider on his face. Cyrus coaxes his head with a sigh as he anticipated what TJ was about to say next.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll race ya!\u201d TJ bounces on his toes before quickly racing towards the building, Katie and Coop following his fast lead.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cStop making me run all the time!\u201d Cyrus whines as he lags behind the Kippen kids.\u00a0<br></p><p>[<a href=\"http://seriestrash.tumblr.com/post/178426206730/the-list-chapter-six\">Next Chapter</a>]<br></p><hr><p><b>End Notes:\u00a0</b>Thanks to everyone who left me comments on the last chapter!

Today Cyrus is spending some quality time with his dad and stepmother whilst TJ is occupied with some of his basketball friends.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus is currently out to lunch with his parents&nbsp;at some fancy vegan restaurant even though none of them embrace that lifestyle full-time.&nbsp;Cyrus is poking at the chickpeas in his salad when his phone buzzes. Normally his parents would scold this but his father and stepmother were too engaged in their own conversation to notice him pull his cell out of his pocket.</p><p>Cyrus&rsquo; smile widens when he sees it&rsquo;s a text message from TJ.&nbsp;<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c284cba0f77c4130695a556b692c4f0a/tumblr_inline_pew33888G61unll6l_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Cyrus laughs quietly to himself at TJ&rsquo;s broken heart emoji reply.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s got you so happy?&rdquo; Sharon coaxes her head with a raised brow.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; Cyrus says defensively,&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just TJ.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, TJ,&rdquo; Sharon bops her head,&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the tall one you&rsquo;ve been spending time with?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo; Cyrus laughs nervously and he&rsquo;s not entirely sure why.&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s babysitting his brother and sister tonight and asked if I wanted to stay over. Is that okay?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;A sleepover?&rdquo; Cyrus&rsquo; father, Norman poses it like a question,&nbsp;&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t had a sleepover with a friend since the girls were little.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks for the reminder, dad.&rdquo; Cyrus mumbles to himself and he reflects on the time he became aware that boy/girl sleepovers were not considered normal and it ultimately making him feel like the odd one out in their friendship.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well I don&rsquo;t see why not.&rdquo; Norman nods with a smile,&nbsp;&ldquo;You be sure to thank his parents when you see them and extend the same offer to TJ. I can&rsquo;t speak for your mom and Todd but I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s just as welcome at their house anytime.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Cyrus finishes up with his parents and goes home to pack an overnight bag before Sharon gives him a lift to TJ&rsquo;s apartment building.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus had been here before, depending on what they were doing for the day it was quicker for Cyrus to walk by TJ&rsquo;s apartment first when leaving from - or going home to - his mom&rsquo;s house but it was a bit further from his dad&rsquo;s. Although he&rsquo;d been here before Cyrus had never actually been inside which wasn&rsquo;t too odd to Cyrus because TJ had only popped inside Cyrus&rsquo; house a couple times when hanging out, to use the bathroom or grab a drink quickly before they moved on to whatever activity they had planned next.&nbsp;</p><p>Although they had gotten comfortable with each other over the end of the school year and a lot closer in the first few weeks of summer the two had never had a sleepover before and it was making Cyrus anxious. He hadn&rsquo;t had a sleepover - other than the occasional cousin sleepover during family gatherings - &nbsp;since he was 10 years old and even back then it was with his two female best friends. Cyrus didn&rsquo;t know what to expect from a boys night, especially since he knew he didn&rsquo;t favour a lot of&nbsp;&lsquo;typical&rsquo; male interests. This was evident at how out of place Cyrus could feel when trying to impress Jonah.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus stands out front of the building and texts TJ to let him know he&rsquo;s waiting downstairs but after a few minutes pass and his text goes unanswered, Cyrus steps up to the intercom and calls the room listed under Kippen.&nbsp;</p><p>A woman Cyrus assumes is TJ&rsquo;s mother answers, Cyrus had&nbsp;never actually met TJ&rsquo;s parents despite TJ having met all four of his at either his bash mitzvah or in passing during one of the times they&rsquo;ve hung out over the summer.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus makes his way up to the second floor and wraps his knuckles on the door that reads&nbsp;&lsquo;2A&rsquo;. &nbsp;A little girl answers, Cyrus knows this to be TJ&rsquo;s little sister as he had seen TJ tagged in a photo with his younger siblings on facebook.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Cyrus.&rdquo; He smiles at her,&nbsp;&ldquo;TJ&rsquo;s friend.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Katie, you&rsquo;re not supposed to answer the door.&rdquo; A woman comes jogging into view.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You said he could come up.&rdquo; She refers to the intercom call.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re<i> still </i>not supposed to open the door.&rdquo; She says firmly and Cyrus sensed the woman was a little frazzled over something.&nbsp;&ldquo;Now go tell you brother, Cyrus is here.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>With a pout she runs off down the hall. TJ&rsquo;s mother turns to Cyrus with a wide smile and introduces herself as Tess before leading him towards the kitchen. She&rsquo;s speaking quickly as they walk but Cyrus managed to decipher what she was talking about. Tess was expressing how it was nice to finally meet Cyrus after hearing so much about him, especially over the summer.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to meet you too, Mrs. Kippen.&rdquo; Cyrus returns the sentiment politely.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Ms. and Tess is just fine thank you.&rdquo; She corrects kindly.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Cyrus smiles and nods. He didn&rsquo;t know TJ&rsquo;s parent&rsquo;s weren&rsquo;t together but after thinking about it for a moment Cyrus realised TJ didn&rsquo;t talk about his family much at all and when he did, he didn&rsquo;t talk about his father ever.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry I&rsquo;m in a bit of a rush to get ready for work.&rdquo; Tess apologises.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s alright.&rdquo; Cyrus hovers by as she flits around the kitchen and he was quietly hoping TJ would surface soon.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Junior!&rdquo; Tess calls out for TJ and Cyrus lets the faintest laugh escape before he stifles it quickly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s always got his headphones on.&rdquo;&nbsp;Tess turns to Cyrus with a sigh.&nbsp;</p><p>Katie skips into the kitchen and Tess gives her attention to the young girl, &ldquo;Katie I thought I asked you to get TJ?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You told me to tell my brother Cyrus is here, so I told Cooper.&rdquo; She laughs devilishly and Cyrus cracks a smile at this.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Take Cyrus to TJ&rsquo;s room please,&rdquo; Tess lets out a deflated breath.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Katie grabs Cyrus&rsquo; hand and drags him down the hall, the gesture made Cyrus&rsquo; heart ache with cuteness overload.&nbsp;</p><p>Katie barges into TJ&rsquo;s room without knocking and Cyrus is dragged along in the process.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Teej, your friend is here!&rdquo; Katie says loudly and she drops her hold of Cyrus&rsquo; hand.&nbsp;</p><p>A very surprised TJ flicks the headphones off his ears and stops whatever he was doing at his desk.&nbsp;&ldquo;Cyrus?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus is confused by the sight for a second, TJ was at his desk, a mess of loose papers scattered across it, rounded glasses perched up high on the bridge of his nose.&nbsp;All Cyrus can respond with is, &ldquo;You wear glasses?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;&nbsp;TJ sheepishly plucks them from his face and throws them at the desk.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;He does.&rdquo; Katie says and TJ tells her to scram.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with wearing glasses.&rdquo; Cyrus says once they&rsquo;re alone,&nbsp;&ldquo;I just had no idea you wore them.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because I wear contacts in public.&rdquo; TJ mumbles.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Cyrus picks up the frames from TJ&rsquo;s desk and holds them close to his eyes, the blurred vision it gave Cyrus was like an instant headache,&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh my god.&rdquo; Cyrus chuckles as he puts them back down,&nbsp;&ldquo;Can you even see right now without these?&rdquo; He laughs.&nbsp;</p><p>TJ folds his arms like an embarrassed child. Even though TJ knew Cyrus wasn&rsquo;t making fun of him, he was still shy about it.&nbsp;&ldquo;You got here quickly.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been two hours since you texted me.&rdquo; Cyrus states.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; TJ looks at the time on his phone and his missed text from Cyrus earlier pops up.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Your mom let me up.&rdquo; Cyrus smiles.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, I guess I got caught up with my studying.&rdquo; TJ apologises.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Studying in summer?&rdquo; Cyrus questions.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I see a special tutor once a week for my&nbsp;dyscalculia, it&rsquo;s supposed to help me catch up before school starts again.&rdquo; TJ is sheepish.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Cyrus smiles encouragingly and he genuinely felt proud that TJ was working with his learning disability rather than fighting against it.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You can put your bag down wherever,&rdquo; TJ stands from his desk chair.<br /></p><p>Cyrus drops his overnight bag from his shoulder and places it by the bunkbed in the room.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I have to share a room with Cooper since Katie&rsquo;s going to be a girl one day and want her privacy.&rdquo; TJ rolls his eyes.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not a girl now?&rdquo; Cyrus looks confused.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s 7 and still wants to hang around her brothers all the time.&rdquo; TJ laughs,&nbsp;&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t even want to stop sharing a room with Coop but mom says she&rsquo;ll change her mind soon enough.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s anything like Buffy and Andi, she&rsquo;ll be about 10.&rdquo; Cyrus says mindlessly as he looks around TJ&rsquo;s room, taking in the surroundings.&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s when their parents got weird about our friendship.&rdquo; Cyrus&rsquo; gaze lands back on TJ.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s kinda small but we can hang in the living room tonight once the twins go to bed.&rdquo; TJ smiles weakly. He was doing that thing where you talk down what you have because you&rsquo;re embarrassed and Cyrus didn&rsquo;t like that very much at all.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I like it.&rdquo; Cyrus says with a smile. It was a small room with a single bunkbed pressed against one wall, a desk on the other side of the room by the door and a bookshelf opposite the closet. The little details were what caught Cyrus&rsquo; eye. The mesh of TJ&rsquo;s stuff with Cooper&rsquo;s. Some were immediately easier to differentiate and others not so much. Like the sports memorabilia, Cyrus assumed it belonged to TJ, along with the shelf of trophies and ribbons from basketball and other athletic accomplishments whilst a few scattered toys seemed to belong to Cooper. It was a few comic and science themed things that didn&rsquo;t immediately make sense to Cyrus.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Teej.</i>&rdquo;&nbsp;Tess&rsquo;s voice bellows from the kitchen and&nbsp;TJ motions for them to go find out what she wants.&nbsp;</p><p>Once in the kitchen the two boys plant themselves on a bench stool each and Tess announces that she&rsquo;s leaving.&nbsp;Cyrus immediately notices the scrubs she&rsquo;s changed into. It makes Cyrus remember something TJ had said casually in conversation about his mother being a nurse.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You know the drill, if you go out the kids go with you, no further than the park and in before sun down.&rdquo; Tess looks to TJ.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes mom, I know.&rdquo; TJ nods.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;And lights out by 8.&rdquo; Tess gently wiggles her finger in front of her sons face,&nbsp;&ldquo;Last night you kept them both up after 10.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Which on of them ratted on me?&rdquo; TJ glares.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Neither of them had to. They both slept in later than me and I&rsquo;m the one working overnights.&rdquo; Tess gives him a knowing look.&nbsp;&ldquo;Now, I left money for pizza in the top drawer and there is a few extra dollars for one side.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Got it.&rdquo; TJ nods and watches his mother flit about the room in a rush, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re running late you better hurry.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Keys?&rdquo; Tess looks to him as she pats her non existent pockets.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Vegetable drawer in the fridge.&rdquo; TJ says casually although Cyrus understandably registers this as odd.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Katie.</i>&rdquo; Tess says with a sigh as she retrieves her car keys from exactly where TJ said they&rsquo;d be.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She likes to hide things,&rdquo; TJ turns to Cyrus with an explanation,&nbsp;&ldquo;I saw her put them in there after lunch.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Cyrus lets out a quiet chuckle and a few questions about that came to mind, like for starters, why? Also, why didn&rsquo;t TJ take them out if he saw her put them there?</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, and&nbsp;remember to sort out your dirty laundry,&rdquo; Tess says as she slings her handbag over her shoulder,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been asking for two days now, Junior!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Mom.</i>&rdquo; TJ lets out an embarrassed grumble.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, Teej.&rdquo; Tess smiles sympathetically.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Want to embarrass me anymore in front of my friend or are you ready to go to work now?&rdquo; TJ tries to fake being angry at his mom but his efforts are fooled with a sweet smile.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Tess challenges TJ&rsquo;s remark and gives him a big smooch on the cheek. Immediately TJ wipes at where she marked him.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;And take a shower, you smell terrible.&rdquo; Tess says with a crinkled nose.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Mom!</i>&rdquo; TJ gives her a look, this time he wasn&rsquo;t smiling.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, okay, I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; Tess laughs,&nbsp;&ldquo;Cyrus, it was lovely to meet you, sorry I&rsquo;m such a hurry.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s alright Ms- Uh- Tess,&rdquo; Cyrus corrects himself with a smile,&nbsp;&ldquo;Have a nice night at work.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Tess finally leaves after popping her head into the living room to say see you later to the twins.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s such a mess when she gets called in for extra shifts.&rdquo; TJ shakes his head with a chuckle. He stands from his stool and goes to the fridge.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>\"I like her,&rdquo; Cyrus says positively,&nbsp;&ldquo;With my accident prone ways I think having a nurse for a parent would be far more beneficial than four shrink parents,&rdquo; Cyrus half jokes,&nbsp;&ldquo;All that does is make me think I&rsquo;m crazy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>TJ closes the fridge with a quiet chuckle.&nbsp;&ldquo;I bet it makes you analyse other people a lot too.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus tosses his head from side to side,&nbsp;&ldquo;True.. but I&rsquo;m almost never right with my assumptions.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Scary basketball guy.&rdquo; TJ motions to himself before he&nbsp;retrieves two glasses from an overhead cupboard and proceeds to pour them both a juice.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo; Cyrus laughs softly.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh and for the record,&rdquo; TJ pushes one glass towards Cyrus,&nbsp;&ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;<i>Junior&rsquo;,&nbsp;</i>doesn&rsquo;t leave this room. I <i>hate </i>when my mom calls me that.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Cyrus bites down on a smile,&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny because of how tall you are.&rdquo; Cyrus chuckles.&nbsp;&ldquo;I mean I knew the &lsquo;J&rsquo;&nbsp;in your name stood for Junior but you don&rsquo;t look like a Junior to me. It doesn&rsquo;t fit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you know it stood for that?&rdquo; TJ questions.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I found it in the yearbook.&rdquo; Cyrus recalls stumbling upon it when searching for Buffy&rsquo;s crush.&nbsp;</p><p>TJ lets out a groan. &ldquo;I forgot they put my full name in there.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Now &lsquo;Teej&rsquo; on the other hand,&rdquo; Cyrus takes a sip from his glass,&nbsp;&ldquo;I like that a lot more, I&rsquo;m going to start using it.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>TJ crinkles his nose at Cyrus&rsquo; affirmation&nbsp;although he does not protest against it.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So I was looking at the list earlier and I thought of a few things we could check off it.&rdquo; TJ says after skulling his entire glass of juice in one go.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Tonight?&rdquo; Cyrus questions.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, why not be productive with this babysitting session,&rdquo; TJ laughs.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be fun.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, what tasks?&rdquo; Cyrus asks.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Make a basket, watch a scary movie and stay up for 24 hours.&rdquo; TJ lists.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Cyrus curls his facial expression into pure dread.&nbsp;&ldquo;That&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t sound fun.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Too bad.&rdquo;&nbsp;TJ does his signature pout and smirk combo,&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been avoiding&nbsp;&lsquo;make a basket&rsquo; since I added it to the list last week.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah but wasn&rsquo;t laser tag <i>so</i> much more fun instead?&rdquo; Cyrus deflects.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It was pretty fun,&rdquo; TJ admits but he shakes his head and returns to his point,&nbsp;&ldquo;There is a court behind the building, I say we go now whilst it&rsquo;s still light out.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Reluctantly Cyrus agrees and TJ goes to the living room to round up his siblings.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Come on we&rsquo;re going down to the court.&rdquo; TJ instructs.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Katie happily jumps up from her place on the sofa whilst Cooper seemed even more reluctant about the idea than Cyrus.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Do I have to come?&rdquo; Cooper mumbles and it was evident he was uncomfortable around Cyrus.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Last time I went downstairs and left you up here alone you set the kitchen on fire and mom grounded me for a week.&rdquo; TJ folds his arms.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to.&rdquo; Cooper says quietly and admits defeat quickly. Cooper leaves to get a book to take down and TJ leans into Cyrus to make sure his brother didn&rsquo;t hear him when he explained that Cooper was really shy.&nbsp;</p><p>After TJ retrieves a basketball, the four make their way downstairs and out onto the small court behind TJ&rsquo;s apartment building, it was late afternoon but there is still plenty of sun left for the day. Katie and Cooper sit on a bench seat by the court together whilst TJ takes the lead with this active task from the list.&nbsp;</p><p>TJ playfully dribbles the ball around Cyrus and makes a basket whilst&nbsp;Cyrus turns his body to follow TJ and remains firm that his ability on the court was embarrassing.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You make it look so easy.&rdquo; Cyrus folds his arms as TJ retrieves the ball,&nbsp;&ldquo;I hate that.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>TJ pretends to hand the ball to Cyrus but turns quickly and makes another shot instead.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re just showing off.&rdquo; Cyrus glares.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I was already showing off before.&rdquo; TJ shrugs with a smirk.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay we get it, you&rsquo;re the basketball guy,&rdquo; Cyrus waves his hands about,&nbsp;&ldquo;Now are you going to teach me or what?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes Sir.&rdquo; TJ laughs at Cyrus&rsquo; mood swing.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>TJ uses his basketball captain ways to teach Cyrus a little technique with his stance and hold of the ball before moving on to tips for the actual throw itself.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus fails a few times, they&rsquo;re&nbsp;horrible attempts at first but he did manage to get a little better. Although he was getting better, TJ could tell Cyrus lacked enthusiasm about this particular task. Even though he was not enthusiastic, the boys still had their usual amount of fun with it.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus breaks his failed attempts to show TJ how he likes to shoot basketballs, where he stands under the net and throws it up but it comes back down and smacks him in the face.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Underdog are you okay?&rdquo; TJ winces and jogs over to his friend.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Cyrus gently rubs his nose where the ball collided,&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even throw the ball hard enough to injure myself.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You make not being hurt sound like a bad thing.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;At least I&rsquo;d know then that I was making progress.&rdquo; Cyrus sighs.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You are making progress.&rdquo; TJ assures as he slaps a hand to Cyrus&rsquo; shoulder,&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got it this time,<i> I can feel it</i>.&rdquo; TJ says as he picks up the ball and hands it to Cyrus.&nbsp;&ldquo;Deep breath, I believe in you.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Do I have to?&rdquo; Cyrus pouts.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Last try for the day, I promise.&rdquo; TJ says,&nbsp;&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t make this one we&rsquo;ll try again another day.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Cyrus is doubtful but takes the ball and goes to the free throw line. If failing one more time was all he had to do to stop for the day, then he might as well get it over with.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus pauses and looks to TJ who has gone over with the twins. Katie seemed enthralled in his efforts whilst Cooper didn&rsquo;t lift his gaze from his book.&nbsp;TJ holds Cyrus&rsquo; eye contact and nods encouragingly.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus holds the ball out in front of himself and takes a deep breath. <i>You got this&hellip;</i></p><p>&ldquo;You can do it, Cyrus!&rdquo; Katie cheers encouragingly and Cyrus sends her a thankful smile before turning his attention back to the hoop.<br /></p><p>With another deep breath, Cyrus moves himself into position like TJ had showed him. Then he counts back from three in his head and throws the ball. Cyrus watches as it effortlessly falls through the hoop.</p><p>&ldquo;Can we go inside no-&rdquo; Cyrus stops once he processes what just happened.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Katie is squealing with glee and TJ has a huge grin plastered on his face whilst his arms are thrown up in the air excitedly. Even Cooper wore a hint of an impressed expression on his face.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Did I just?&rdquo; Cyrus turns to TJ.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You did it!&rdquo; TJ rushes over to him.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I did it.&rdquo; Cyrus laughs in disbelief.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>After a moment of celebration TJ jokingly suggests they play a little one on one.</p><p>&ldquo;I wanna play!&rdquo; Katie is with them and she jumps up and down.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You two can play, I need to quit whilst I&rsquo;m ahead.&rdquo; Cyrus laughs.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Boo!&rdquo; Katie whines and TJ mimics with a cute&nbsp;&lsquo;boo&rsquo; of his own.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; Cyrus gives in quickly,&nbsp;&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re going to need someone else to play so we&rsquo;re even teams.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>The three standing on the court turn their gazes to Cooper who is looking at them with confusion.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;No way.&rdquo; Cooper mumbles almost too quiet for them to hear from where they stand.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Come on, Coop, it&rsquo;ll be fun.&rdquo; TJ says.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, Coop,<i> please</i>?&rdquo; Katie begs.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You can be on my team.&rdquo; Cyrus smiles,&nbsp;&ldquo;I know that&rsquo;s an unconvincing argument but I&rsquo;ll let you in on a little secret,&rdquo; Cyrus covers his mouth on the side closest to TJ, as if he were actually telling a secret but he speaks at his usual volume,&nbsp;&ldquo;TJ lets me win a lot.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I do not!&rdquo; TJ says defensively.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You do so,&rdquo; Cyrus laughs,&nbsp;&ldquo;You think it will make me feel better about sucking at everything.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suck at everything, you just don&rsquo;t even try sometimes.&rdquo; TJ folds his arms.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>\"You still let me win to boost my confidence.&rdquo; Cyrus smiles.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m certainly not going easy on you with this game.&rdquo; TJ states.&nbsp;&ldquo;Winner gets to choose the side we order for dinner.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oo, high stakes!&rdquo; Cyrus wriggles his brows as he turns back to Cooper,&nbsp;&ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Cooper still looks a little reluctant but agrees with a quiet sigh. Once they&rsquo;re all ready to play TJ declares that the first to three wins.&nbsp;</p><p>A goofy game gets underway and plenty of standard rules were broken, one of them was the way Katie just runs with the ball. At one point Cyrus noticed TJ purposely fumble his catch so Cooper could get a go with the ball. The two older boys exchange a look after this, Cyrus&rsquo; was knowing like he was right about TJ letting them win and TJ just innocently shrugs and pretends like he didnt know why Cyrus was looking at him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Once Katie gets the ball again, TJ picks her up and sits her on his shoulders so she can make a basket.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s cheating!&rdquo; Cooper exclaims, by this point in the game he had loosened up.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Nu-uh,&rdquo; TJ says in a childish way.&nbsp;&ldquo;This is no rules basketball!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Cyrus looks like they&rsquo;ve been dealt a great injustice before realising he can cleverly use this to his advantage,&nbsp;&ldquo;If I spin around three times really fast and touch my toes that&rsquo;s worth infinity points and ends the game early.&rdquo; Cyrus does just as he mentioned and excitedly exclaims,&nbsp;&ldquo;Game over we win!&rdquo; Cyrus turns to Cooper excitedly with a high-five.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re no fun.&rdquo; TJ laughs and Katie, still on TJ&rsquo;s shoulders folds her arms in a huff.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m just smarter and evidently a better basketball player.&rdquo; Cyrus jokes and he stretches down to touch his toes again.&nbsp;&ldquo;Double infinity points to us.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>TJ rolls his eyes with a smile,&nbsp;&ldquo;Okay kids lets hit the showers,&rdquo; TJ claps his hands together and points up towards their building.</p><p>TJ looks to Cyrus with a smile slowly creeping wider on his face. Cyrus coaxes his head with a sigh as he anticipated what TJ was about to say next.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll race ya!&rdquo; TJ bounces on his toes before quickly racing towards the building, Katie and Coop following his fast lead.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Stop making me run all the time!&rdquo; Cyrus whines as he lags behind the Kippen kids.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>[<a href=\"http://seriestrash.tumblr.com/post/178426206730/the-list-chapter-six\">Next Chapter</a>]<br /></p><hr /><p><b>End Notes:&nbsp;</b>Thanks to everyone who left me comments on the last chapter!
