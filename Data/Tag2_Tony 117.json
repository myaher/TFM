The last thing he remembered was working a mission with the team then being Incased In a green light. </p><p><br/></p><p>He woke up on his back tied down without his suit, and his team no where to be found. He held up his head to look around the room as much as he could. </p><p><br/></p><p>It was plain and dull with a single window and a small TV in the corner. The only interesting thing was the arm chair in the corner that was occupied you a handsome figure. &ldquo;Hello Stark.&rdquo; The man smirked and Tony tested his bonds again.</p><p><br/></p><p> &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; The man crossed his arms and stood, walking almost silently to the bed. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just say I am someone you made a little irritated. I didn&rsquo;t like your team breaking into my base.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s eyes widened a little. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Strange?&rdquo; The man nodded. &ldquo;I really wish we didn&rsquo;t have to meet this way.&rdquo; Stephen stood straight and turned to the bedside table that was out of Tony&rsquo;s line of sight, hidden by a pillow. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done some research about you Stark.&rdquo; Stephen was working on something out of Tony&rsquo;s sight. &ldquo;You have some interesting tastes you hide from the public don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean.&rdquo; Tony strained his neck, trying to get a better look. Stephen noticed and set down what ever he was holding, turning to Tony. </p><p><br/></p><p>He put his fingers on Tony&rsquo;s Jawline, making the restrained man shiver. Stephen&rsquo;s finger&rsquo;s traveled as he talked. &ldquo;I think you do.&rdquo; Stephen muttered, finally resting his hand against Tony&rsquo;s throat and digging his nails into the soft flesh. </p><p><br/></p><p>Tony winced but he was soon calm, biting the inside of his cheek, eyes screwed shut. Stephen pulled away. &ldquo;See? Very interesting indeed.&rdquo; Tony took a deep breath, willing himself to push away any unwanted urges. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;How.&rdquo; His voice came out slightly raspy. &ldquo;I have my ways, we can just call it magic.&rdquo; Tony turned his head and looked at the wall. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry stark, no one will find out. But I do plan on having some fun with this information.&rdquo; </p><p><br/></p><p>Tony took a deep breath and turned his head to look at Stephen. His breath hitched when he saw the man holding a small jeweled knife. &ldquo;Pretty isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Stephen stepped closer and carefully crawled onto the bed to straddle Tony. </p><p><br/></p><p>Tony kept his mouth shut, eyes locked on the knife, mind running wild with possibilities. Stephen tilted his head as if in thought then clicked his tongue. &ldquo;To bad we will have to cut this shirt off, it&rsquo;s rather nice.&rdquo; </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;ll have to pay for it.&rdquo; Tony replied quickly, taking his eyes from the knife and staring Stephen in the eyes. The man chuckled quietly. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry you will be reimbursed in full.&rdquo; Stephen set the knife at the edge of Tony&rsquo;s shirt that had ridden up slightly, showing some of Tony&rsquo;s stomach. </p><p><br/></p><p>Stephen made a small two inch cut in the fabric before setting the knife on bed and smirking. Stephen&rsquo;s fingers softly traveled from the exposed skin of Tony&rsquo;s stomach up Tony&rsquo;s abdomen until he reached the arc reactor. </p><p><br/></p><p>Tony closed his eyes with a sigh and let his head fall back against the pillows. Stephen&rsquo;s fingers made their way back down Tony&rsquo;s body until they reached the tear in his shirt. </p><p><br/></p><p>He grabbed the fabric and waited a moment before ripping his shirt open. A surprised gasp left Tony, causing Strange&rsquo;s pupil&rsquo;s to blow. &ldquo;What a lovely sight.&rdquo; Stephen cooed and Tony&rsquo;s eyes opened every so slightly.</p><p><br/></p><p> &ldquo;I swear to god if you don&rsquo;t get on with it.&rdquo; He growled and it made Stephen chuckle. &ldquo;Patience.&rdquo; Stephen reclaimed the knife and softly pressed it to the flesh right above Tony&rsquo;s belly button. </p><p><br/></p><p>Stephen leaned forward placing a kiss on Tony&rsquo;s pulse point before biting down on it at the same time he put pressure on the blade, just enough to cause a thin cut. Tony gasped and let out a quiet moan, biting his lip. </p><p><br/></p><p>Stephen gave him a moment, working on causing a very dark love bite on his neck before dragging the blade up to right under the ark reactor. Tony hissed and Stephen sat up, studding his work. There was a very thin cut running up Tony\u2019s body. It dripped blood slowly in some areas.  </p><p><br/></p><p>Stephen put the blade above Tony\u2019s heart and slowly carved and X into the flesh causing Tony to let out a long strained moan. \u201cF-fuck.\u201d He hissed Tony felt his pants getting tighter than what was comfortable and it caused him to squirm. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Stephen asked slyly. \u201cJust t-touch me or&hellip;\u201d Tony huffed. \u201cJust do something!\u201d Stephen chuckled and carefully brought the knife to his lips, slowly licking the blood from it.</p><p><br/></p><p> \u201cBeg for it.\u201d Stephen smirked and tony pulled against his restraints. \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d He hissed and Stephen shrugged. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cAlrighty then.\u201d Stephen leaned over Tony again and carved small designs into his chest, right over his collar bone. Tony bit his lip and failed to hold back a desperate moan. </p><p><br/></p><p>Stephen continued his carvings and leaned down next to Tony\u2019s ear. \u201cHave something to say?\u201d He whispered before biting Tony\u2019s ear. Tony let out a quiet cry and squirmed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p> \u201cOkay then.\u201d Stephen pulled back a little and focused his precise cuts into Tony\u2019s stomach. \u201cF-fuck.\u201d Tony huffed and tried to raise his hips desperately. </p><p><br/></p><p>Stephen just dug the knife into his flesh and Tony caved. \u201cP-please Strange.\u201d He squirmed a little and tears came to the corners of his eyes. \u201cPlease what.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cFuck me.\u201d Tony groaned raising his hips again.

The man chuckled quietly. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry you will be reimbursed in full.\u201d Stephen set the knife at the edge of Tony\u2019s shirt that had ridden up slightly, showing some of Tony\u2019s stomach. </p><p><br></p><p>Stephen made a small two inch cut in the fabric before setting the knife on bed and smirking. Stephen\u2019s fingers softly traveled from the exposed skin of Tony\u2019s stomach up Tony\u2019s abdomen until he reached the arc reactor. </p><p><br></p><p>Tony closed his eyes with a sigh and let his head fall back against the pillows. Stephen\u2019s fingers made their way back down Tony\u2019s body until they reached the tear in his shirt. </p><p><br></p><p>He grabbed the fabric and waited a moment before ripping his shirt open. A surprised gasp left Tony, causing Strange\u2019s pupil\u2019s to blow. \u201cWhat a lovely sight.\u201d Stephen cooed and Tony\u2019s eyes opened every so slightly.</p><p><br></p><p> \u201cI swear to god if you don\u2019t get on with it.\u201d He growled and it made Stephen chuckle. \u201cPatience.\u201d Stephen reclaimed the knife and softly pressed it to the flesh right above Tony\u2019s belly button. </p><p><br></p><p>Stephen leaned forward placing a kiss on Tony\u2019s pulse point before biting down on it at the same time he put pressure on the blade, just enough to cause a thin cut. Tony gasped and let out a quiet moan, biting his lip. </p><p><br></p><p>Stephen gave him a moment, working on causing a very dark love bite on his neck before dragging the blade up to right under the ark reactor. Tony hissed and Stephen sat up, studding his work. There was a very thin cut running up Tony\u2019s body. It dripped blood slowly in some areas.  </p><p><br></p><p>Stephen put the blade above Tony\u2019s heart and slowly carved and X into the flesh causing Tony to let out a long strained moan. \u201cF-fuck.\u201d He hissed Tony felt his pants getting tighter than what was comfortable and it caused him to squirm. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Stephen asked slyly. \u201cJust t-touch me or\u2026\u201d Tony huffed. \u201cJust do something!\u201d Stephen chuckled and carefully brought the knife to his lips, slowly licking the blood from it.</p><p><br></p><p> \u201cBeg for it.\u201d Stephen smirked and tony pulled against his restraints. \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d He hissed and Stephen shrugged. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAlrighty then.\u201d Stephen leaned over Tony again and carved small designs into his chest, right over his collar bone. Tony bit his lip and failed to hold back a desperate moan. </p><p><br></p><p>Stephen continued his carvings and leaned down next to Tony\u2019s ear. \u201cHave something to say?\u201d He whispered before biting Tony\u2019s ear. Tony let out a quiet cry and squirmed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p> \u201cOkay then.\u201d Stephen pulled back a little and focused his precise cuts into Tony\u2019s stomach. \u201cF-fuck.\u201d Tony huffed and tried to raise his hips desperately. </p><p><br></p><p>Stephen just dug the knife into his flesh and Tony caved. \u201cP-please Strange.\u201d He squirmed a little and tears came to the corners of his eyes. \u201cPlease what.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cFuck me.\u201d Tony groaned raising his hips again.

The man chuckled quietly. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry you will be reimbursed in full.&rdquo; Stephen set the knife at the edge of Tony&rsquo;s shirt that had ridden up slightly, showing some of Tony&rsquo;s stomach. </p><p><br /></p><p>Stephen made a small two inch cut in the fabric before setting the knife on bed and smirking. Stephen&rsquo;s fingers softly traveled from the exposed skin of Tony&rsquo;s stomach up Tony&rsquo;s abdomen until he reached the arc reactor. </p><p><br /></p><p>Tony closed his eyes with a sigh and let his head fall back against the pillows. Stephen&rsquo;s fingers made their way back down Tony&rsquo;s body until they reached the tear in his shirt. </p><p><br /></p><p>He grabbed the fabric and waited a moment before ripping his shirt open. A surprised gasp left Tony, causing Strange&rsquo;s pupil&rsquo;s to blow. &ldquo;What a lovely sight.&rdquo; Stephen cooed and Tony&rsquo;s eyes opened every so slightly.</p><p><br /></p><p> &ldquo;I swear to god if you don&rsquo;t get on with it.&rdquo; He growled and it made Stephen chuckle. &ldquo;Patience.&rdquo; Stephen reclaimed the knife and softly pressed it to the flesh right above Tony&rsquo;s belly button. </p><p><br /></p><p>Stephen leaned forward placing a kiss on Tony&rsquo;s pulse point before biting down on it at the same time he put pressure on the blade, just enough to cause a thin cut. Tony gasped and let out a quiet moan, biting his lip. </p><p><br /></p><p>Stephen gave him a moment, working on causing a very dark love bite on his neck before dragging the blade up to right under the ark reactor. Tony hissed and Stephen sat up, studding his work. There was a very thin cut running up Tony&rsquo;s body. It dripped blood slowly in some areas.  </p><p><br /></p><p>Stephen put the blade above Tony&rsquo;s heart and slowly carved and X into the flesh causing Tony to let out a long strained moan. &ldquo;F-fuck.&rdquo; He hissed Tony felt his pants getting tighter than what was comfortable and it caused him to squirm. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Stephen asked slyly. &ldquo;Just t-touch me or&hellip;&rdquo; Tony huffed. &ldquo;Just do something!&rdquo; Stephen chuckled and carefully brought the knife to his lips, slowly licking the blood from it.</p><p><br /></p><p> &ldquo;Beg for it.&rdquo; Stephen smirked and tony pulled against his restraints. &ldquo;Absolutely not.&rdquo; He hissed and Stephen shrugged. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Alrighty then.&rdquo; Stephen leaned over Tony again and carved small designs into his chest, right over his collar bone. Tony bit his lip and failed to hold back a desperate moan. </p><p><br /></p><p>Stephen continued his carvings and leaned down next to Tony&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;Have something to say?&rdquo; He whispered before biting Tony&rsquo;s ear. Tony let out a quiet cry and squirmed. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p> &ldquo;Okay then.&rdquo; Stephen pulled back a little and focused his precise cuts into Tony&rsquo;s stomach. &ldquo;F-fuck.&rdquo; Tony huffed and tried to raise his hips desperately. </p><p><br /></p><p>Stephen just dug the knife into his flesh and Tony caved. &ldquo;P-please Strange.&rdquo; He squirmed a little and tears came to the corners of his eyes. &ldquo;Please what.&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Fuck me.&rdquo; Tony groaned raising his hips again. Stephen smirked and held the knife to Tony&rsquo;s lips. When Tony didn&rsquo;t move Stephen Just wiped the blood off across Tony&rsquo;s cheek. </p><p><br /></p><p>He dropped the knife onto the bed side table with a clank and smiled down at Tony. He carefully worked Tony&rsquo;s pants down to around his knees and his smile turned into a smirk. </p><p><br /></p><p>He dug his nails into Tony&rsquo;s thighs and dragged them up dangerously close to his crotch until Tony arched his back with a whine. &ldquo;Please.&rdquo; He pleaded and Stephen leaned down, biting Tony&rsquo;s thigh. </p><p><br /></p><p>Tony&rsquo;s cock dribbled precum and Stephen raised an eyebrow. He brought his tongue to the base and Tony panted obviously desperate. Stephen licked one stripe up to the tip. </p><p><br /></p><p>When he got there he took the tip into his mouth and swirled his tongue. He sat up and brought his mouth to Tony&rsquo;s, moving one methodical hand down to his dick. </p><p><br /></p><p>Stephen started out slow, speeding up when he bit Tony&rsquo;s lip. Tony didn&rsquo;t last long. It only took a few strokes and cum was covering Stephen&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Good boy.&rdquo; Stephen muttered bringing his fingers to Tony&rsquo;s mouth. </p><p><br /></p><p>Tony took them without complaining. &ldquo;You look beautiful covered in blood, licking up your own cum.&rdquo; Stephen smiled. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll have to get you back home soon.&rdquo; </p></p>",
