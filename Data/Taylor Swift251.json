I&rsquo;d like to introduce my Swift friends to one of the greatest people I&rsquo;ve ever known. This is my best friend and my youngest son&rsquo;s godmother Kristin. She only got to see him once before she got sick, then in was able to take him to see her while she was in the hospital. I wish so much I could gave taken him again but she was moved a bit far ans he was just a newborn so taking him wasn&rsquo;t the best for him and she woulda kicked my butt had I not put him first lol. We both have battled mental illness our entire adult lives and well into our adolescent years as well. We were able to form such a bond over it and encourage each other. She would giggle and laugh at my love for all things Taylor Swift. She would listen with me and we would get lost in the music and for a little while we were 22 again and having *one of those nights*. I listen to that song, Innocent, and so many others and I think of all the good times we had.  She threw the most amazing gender reveal for me and for the brief time he had her in his life she was the best godmother to my baby boy. </p><p>Back around Christmas she got that awful flu that had been going around. She was not a fan of going to the doctors and she was so excited about getting everyone gifts that she kept putting it off. When she did go to prompt care she was in bad bad shape. Prompt care actually called an ambulance because she was in such bad shape. It was a bit late though. On the way from prompt care to the ER she went into arrest. It took more than 5 minutes to get her stable again. She was never the same after that. She fought soooo very hard to come back to us. It looked like she would make a recovery and then every time something woukd happen; a setback, an infection, heart problems would occur. A few days after my Birthday in May her fight came to an end. She was and always has been truly the embodiment of the song Innocent. She was at time my squad. With a friend like her I didn&rsquo;t need many more. </p><p>In a week my youngest daughter and I will be traveling to St. Louis to see <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV4Fl3h9EtbA_AoZ0ZPG8QQ\">@taylorswift</a>  and for the first time in a while I&rsquo;m really and truly excited. Thank you for that, Taylor, thank you so much. Kristin&rsquo;s anxiety in crowded places was a bit worse than mine so going to big concerts like this would not have been all that feasible, but I always told her she would be the very first to get pics and vids. I&rsquo;ll be wearing the bracelet I got in memory of her and my daughter and I are going to be rocking some witchy wear (they&rsquo;re burning all the witches) because one thing Kristin and I bonded over was Wicked lol. Even though IDSB isn&rsquo;t exactly a best friend song that is our jam. I got to do her hair and make her a tutu for Halloween one year when she dressed up as a witch. </p><p>Oh my gosh I&rsquo;ve rambled on so much. It&rsquo;s easy to do that when talking about someone who lived such a kind and loving life. Anyways, thank you swifties. Watching all of you share your joy and excitement this whole tour is something that has brought so very much joy, and some days boy did I need it. There are so many amazing blogs on here and you guys are seriously some of the most amazing people EVER! </p><p>My little swifty and I will see yall in a week. We&rsquo;ll be in section A Row 17 seats 11 and 12. We will have witch hats but probably won&rsquo;t wear them much so we don&rsquo;t obstruct anyone&rsquo;s view lol. </p><p>Oh and if anyone is looking for some super positive Swift fans to follow here are some that have been such put a smile on my face.

I\u2019d like to introduce my Swift friends to one of the greatest people I\u2019ve ever known. This is my best friend and my youngest son\u2019s godmother Kristin. She only got to see him once before she got sick, then in was able to take him to see her while she was in the hospital. I wish so much I could gave taken him again but she was moved a bit far ans he was just a newborn so taking him wasn\u2019t the best for him and she woulda kicked my butt had I not put him first lol. We both have battled mental illness our entire adult lives and well into our adolescent years as well. We were able to form such a bond over it and encourage each other. She would giggle and laugh at my love for all things Taylor Swift. She would listen with me and we would get lost in the music and for a little while we were 22 again and having *one of those nights*. I listen to that song, Innocent, and so many others and I think of all the good times we had.  She threw the most amazing gender reveal for me and for the brief time he had her in his life she was the best godmother to my baby boy. </p><p>Back around Christmas she got that awful flu that had been going around. She was not a fan of going to the doctors and she was so excited about getting everyone gifts that she kept putting it off. When she did go to prompt care she was in bad bad shape. Prompt care actually called an ambulance because she was in such bad shape. It was a bit late though. On the way from prompt care to the ER she went into arrest. It took more than 5 minutes to get her stable again. She was never the same after that. She fought soooo very hard to come back to us. It looked like she would make a recovery and then every time something woukd happen; a setback, an infection, heart problems would occur. A few days after my Birthday in May her fight came to an end. She was and always has been truly the embodiment of the song Innocent. She was at time my squad. With a friend like her I didn\u2019t need many more. </p><p>In a week my youngest daughter and I will be traveling to St. Louis to see <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV4Fl3h9EtbA_AoZ0ZPG8QQ\">@taylorswift</a>  and for the first time in a while I\u2019m really and truly excited. Thank you for that, Taylor, thank you so much. Kristin\u2019s anxiety in crowded places was a bit worse than mine so going to big concerts like this would not have been all that feasible, but I always told her she would be the very first to get pics and vids. I\u2019ll be wearing the bracelet I got in memory of her and my daughter and I are going to be rocking some witchy wear (they\u2019re burning all the witches) because one thing Kristin and I bonded over was Wicked lol. Even though IDSB isn\u2019t exactly a best friend song that is our jam. I got to do her hair and make her a tutu for Halloween one year when she dressed up as a witch. </p><p>Oh my gosh I\u2019ve rambled on so much. It\u2019s easy to do that when talking about someone who lived such a kind and loving life. Anyways, thank you swifties. Watching all of you share your joy and excitement this whole tour is something that has brought so very much joy, and some days boy did I need it.

A few Days before Taylor announced Reputation, I was diagnosed with OCD in all it&rsquo;s forms and tough Depression. When Taylor announced Rep I felt like she was wiping my tears away and telling me it&rsquo;s okay, I felt like she feels me, she understands what I&rsquo;m going through. Because not only did Taylor disappear, I did too, I left everything behind and got isolated from everything, everyone. When I say Taylor was there for me when no one else was, I literally mean it. When LWYMMD came out, it was the perfect summary of my life, all the betrayal fake people and friends, all the lies, everything. It was exactly what I needed and I kid you not LWYMMD was on repeat all day long. And when Reputation was out, it was everything I wanted, in Delicate, she explains how anxious she felt, and I felt that. In Call It What You Want, I saw how Taylor no longer cares about all the hate, she&rsquo;s focusing on the important people and things in her life which made her feel better than ever, it made me believe that one day, none of these bad days and times will matter, I will genuinely be happy because time can heal most anything. Taylor&rsquo;s happiness in this album gave me so much happiness and strength. It gave me the most important thing, Hope.</p><p>So Taylor, if you ever see this, I want you to know that I Love you more than anything and I always will. I&rsquo;ll always be there supporting you in every way I can. Thank you for everything, for making me realize that my life is worth living and fighting. And my favorite quote in the world which makes me feel better no matter what; If you get rained on, you walk through a bunch of storms, life is constantly coming at you.. that doesn&rsquo;t make you damaged, it makes you Clean.\ud83d\udc9c</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV4Fl3h9EtbA_AoZ0ZPG8QQ\">@taylorswift</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzlqFgYPhDbBo0OlTSyWY3g\">@taylornation</a> </p>",
