Well kids its time to get into what exactly lead Jandi to becoming the dumpster fire it currently is, meaning we\u2019re going to have to look back (*wink wink*) at season two.\u00a0</p><p>So by the start of season two, Andi and Jonah are finally together which means that we won\u2019t have to focus on all the awkwardness of becoming a couple and delving into the more interesting part of a relationship, the relationship itself. Is what should have happened but instead the show seemed quite adamant about not making these two official for as long as possible. At first this would make sense, as since Jonah had just gotten out of a toxic relationship he probably wouldn\u2019t be interested in starting a new one. Here\u2019s the issue though: the show never makes this explicitly clear, and Jonah\u2019s wording leads Andi to believe they\u2019re boyfriend and girlfriend. Instead of having Jonah say something along the lines of\u00a0\u201cHey I\u2019m sorry I let Amber treat you that way, she\u2019s gone now, and I want to try to be friends for real this time\u201d which would align with Andi\u2019s speech in\u00a0\u201cWere We Ever?\u201d, he just says he wants to hang out with her more, which Andi misinterprets as a start for their relationship. And one thing I want to make clear here, and this is something that will come up a lot as we talk more about Jandi, is that many of the problems here are not character issues but writing issues. What I mean is, the problem isn\u2019t the character\u2019s behavior that lines up with their established traits are creating issues, but rather that circumstances forcing them into tedious and arbitrary situations are being manufactured by the writers in order to maintain a poorly thought out story. It\u2019s not Andi nor Jonah\u2019s fault for this miscommunication, as this was something put in place by the writers to extend the story line further. Why? Well that\u2019s a question I\u2019ve answered on several occasions but for those of you new here&hellip;.</p><p>The reason that stories tend end a story with the start of a relationship instead of having two people get together and showing the ways in which a romantic relationship can affect a person is because the romantic leads simply are not interesting enough as a couple to carry an engaging story. I like using the show Friends as an example since its so well known, because it perfectly displays the difference between a couple with chemistry and without. Monica and Chandler were able to get together and stay together in the show because they were entertaining enough as a couple that having to constantly restart their relationship was not necessary. With Ross and Rachel, however, they had little to nothing in common and wouldn\u2019t really contribute much to the show if put together, so they are constantly put in a state of will-they-won\u2019t-they as the constant instability and drama is the only way the writers know how make the audience care even a little bit about them, which a lot of them still didn\u2019t. That\u2019s why saying Jandi would be good if they stopped having drama is a worthless statement because its never going to stop because Andi and Jonah do not have enough romantic chemistry to carry out a descent story line for the rest of the show and the writers know this. And for the first half of season two, it seemed like they were actually going to say something about it.\u00a0</p><p>See, during 2a, a lot of people thought that the show was going to subvert the typical middle school romance by having Andi realize that Jonah <i>wasn\u2019t</i> what she really wanted and that instead of chasing after this idea of a perfect boy she should be with someone she actually shares interests with and doesn\u2019t cause her so much emotional stress in the form of Walker. A lot of people though that was the direction they were going in, including myself, because honestly that would\u2019ve been genius. Take a couple the audience just assumes will be together, than show why they shouldn\u2019t actually be together in the first place and we\u2019re only rooting for them because we\u2019ve been conditioned to like the idea of this kind of couple. The biggest reason so many of us believed this was what was going to happen was that Terri Minsky in an interview when asked about her favorite storyline in Andi Mack said how she was most proud of Andi realizing she didn\u2019t need to be in a relationship, and thusly Jonah. So a lot of us pretty much saw 2a as biding time before the inevitable break up (and in my case the inevitable beginning of Jyrus but we\u2019ll get into that later). From the constant miscommunications, to the distrust, to the absolute failure to find any common interests, the writing seemed to be on the walls that Jandi was gonna sink and sink hard. This all came to a head in\u00a0\u201cWe Were Never\u201d, actually referencing the episode that first broke off Jandi, where it was revealed that Jonah never wanted to be Andi\u2019s boyfriend, and that this whole time Andi had completely misunderstood him. This is frustrating for a multitude of reasons, the biggest being it makes out both Andi and Jonah to be completely incompantent at interpreting basic social cues. It was a story beat that just lead to more questions like, why did Jonah mean when he said he didn\u2019t like labels but considered him and Andi together? He tells Cyrus that him and Andi aren\u2019t broken up, but yet doesn\u2019t think that saying he doesn\u2019t want the label of boyfriend could be interpreted that way? How could Jonah not tell when Andi was very clearly upset when he said he didn\u2019t want the bracelet? Was his hesitance towards labels because of Amber? I know most of these are directed towards Jonah, and to be fair Andi did jump to the conclusion they were dating, but not without reason. What would\u2019ve been so difficult of just having them be an official couple? That\u2019s the assumption everyone else watching it had to begin with so why not? Simple, to continue to drag out the storyline.\u00a0</p><p>If Andi and Jonah had been official, there would\u2019ve been far more of a sense of finality with their\u00a0\u201cbreak up\u201d in\u00a0\u201cWe Were Never\u201d but instead the show can say\u00a0\u201cWell they never <i>really</i>\u00a0were together meaning they didn\u2019t <i>actually</i> break up so we still haven\u2019t seen these two get together\u201d, meaning that the writers have created a scenario in which they can technically repeat the same story beats without it <i>actually</i> being the exact same thing. Now anyone with basic brain functioning knows that\u2019s total bullshit, and pretty much everyone has seen through it. It\u2019s quite frustrating but not as frustrating as what was to come.\u00a0</p><p>Looking back at Bash Mitzvah is truly disheartening, as it was an episode that set it self up to be the turning point for pretty much every character\u2019s storyline but ended up being for the most part an empty promise. One of the bigger examples of this would be the final ending of Jandi, as with Jonah seemingly having lost Andi for good now that she had hung out with Walker and realized that a relationship shouldn\u2019t have to be as emotionally draining as hers was with Jonah, and it seemed that unlike last time when she cut Jonah off, Andi was still willing to be with Jonah in a platonic way. This isn\u2019t what happened obviously and the fans were furious. Of course they would be, since the show was so blatantly being lazy when it came to the writing around Jandi. Surely there\u2019s no other reason that the fans would have a problem with alright you know where this is going and we\u2019ll be getting into that next time.\u00a0</p>",

Well kids its time to get into what exactly lead Jandi to becoming the dumpster fire it currently is, meaning we\u2019re going to have to look back (*wink wink*) at season two.\u00a0</p><p>So by the start of season two, Andi and Jonah are finally together which means that we won\u2019t have to focus on all the awkwardness of becoming a couple and delving into the more interesting part of a relationship, the relationship itself. Is what should have happened but instead the show seemed quite adamant about not making these two official for as long as possible. At first this would make sense, as since Jonah had just gotten out of a toxic relationship he probably wouldn\u2019t be interested in starting a new one. Here\u2019s the issue though: the show never makes this explicitly clear, and Jonah\u2019s wording leads Andi to believe they\u2019re boyfriend and girlfriend. Instead of having Jonah say something along the lines of\u00a0\u201cHey I\u2019m sorry I let Amber treat you that way, she\u2019s gone now, and I want to try to be friends for real this time\u201d which would align with Andi\u2019s speech in\u00a0\u201cWere We Ever?\u201d, he just says he wants to hang out with her more, which Andi misinterprets as a start for their relationship. And one thing I want to make clear here, and this is something that will come up a lot as we talk more about Jandi, is that many of the problems here are not character issues but writing issues. What I mean is, the problem isn\u2019t the character\u2019s behavior that lines up with their established traits are creating issues, but rather that circumstances forcing them into tedious and arbitrary situations are being manufactured by the writers in order to maintain a poorly thought out story. It\u2019s not Andi nor Jonah\u2019s fault for this miscommunication, as this was something put in place by the writers to extend the story line further. Why? Well that\u2019s a question I\u2019ve answered on several occasions but for those of you new here\u2026.</p><p>The reason that stories tend end a story with the start of a relationship instead of having two people get together and showing the ways in which a romantic relationship can affect a person is because the romantic leads simply are not interesting enough as a couple to carry an engaging story. I like using the show Friends as an example since its so well known, because it perfectly displays the difference between a couple with chemistry and without. Monica and Chandler were able to get together and stay together in the show because they were entertaining enough as a couple that having to constantly restart their relationship was not necessary. With Ross and Rachel, however, they had little to nothing in common and wouldn\u2019t really contribute much to the show if put together, so they are constantly put in a state of will-they-won\u2019t-they as the constant instability and drama is the only way the writers know how make the audience care even a little bit about them, which a lot of them still didn\u2019t. That\u2019s why saying Jandi would be good if they stopped having drama is a worthless statement because its never going to stop because Andi and Jonah do not have enough romantic chemistry to carry out a descent story line for the rest of the show and the writers know this. And for the first half of season two, it seemed like they were actually going to say something about it.\u00a0</p><p>See, during 2a, a lot of people thought that the show was going to subvert the typical middle school romance by having Andi realize that Jonah <i>wasn\u2019t</i> what she really wanted and that instead of chasing after this idea of a perfect boy she should be with someone she actually shares interests with and doesn\u2019t cause her so much emotional stress in the form of Walker. A lot of people though that was the direction they were going in, including myself, because honestly that would\u2019ve been genius. Take a couple the audience just assumes will be together, than show why they shouldn\u2019t actually be together in the first place and we\u2019re only rooting for them because we\u2019ve been conditioned to like the idea of this kind of couple. The biggest reason so many of us believed this was what was going to happen was that Terri Minsky in an interview when asked about her favorite storyline in Andi Mack said how she was most proud of Andi realizing she didn\u2019t need to be in a relationship, and thusly Jonah. So a lot of us pretty much saw 2a as biding time before the inevitable break up (and in my case the inevitable beginning of Jyrus but we\u2019ll get into that later). From the constant miscommunications, to the distrust, to the absolute failure to find any common interests, the writing seemed to be on the walls that Jandi was gonna sink and sink hard. This all came to a head in\u00a0\u201cWe Were Never\u201d, actually referencing the episode that first broke off Jandi, where it was revealed that Jonah never wanted to be Andi\u2019s boyfriend, and that this whole time Andi had completely misunderstood him. This is frustrating for a multitude of reasons, the biggest being it makes out both Andi and Jonah to be completely incompantent at interpreting basic social cues. It was a story beat that just lead to more questions like, why did Jonah mean when he said he didn\u2019t like labels but considered him and Andi together? He tells Cyrus that him and Andi aren\u2019t broken up, but yet doesn\u2019t think that saying he doesn\u2019t want the label of boyfriend could be interpreted that way? How could Jonah not tell when Andi was very clearly upset when he said he didn\u2019t want the bracelet? Was his hesitance towards labels because of Amber? I know most of these are directed towards Jonah, and to be fair Andi did jump to the conclusion they were dating, but not without reason. What would\u2019ve been so difficult of just having them be an official couple? That\u2019s the assumption everyone else watching it had to begin with so why not? Simple, to continue to drag out the storyline.\u00a0</p><p>If Andi and Jonah had been official, there would\u2019ve been far more of a sense of finality with their\u00a0\u201cbreak up\u201d in\u00a0\u201cWe Were Never\u201d but instead the show can say\u00a0\u201cWell they never <i>really</i>\u00a0were together meaning they didn\u2019t <i>actually</i> break up so we still haven\u2019t seen these two get together\u201d, meaning that the writers have created a scenario in which they can technically repeat the same story beats without it <i>actually</i> being the exact same thing. Now anyone with basic brain functioning knows that\u2019s total bullshit, and pretty much everyone has seen through it. It\u2019s quite frustrating but not as frustrating as what was to come.\u00a0</p><p>Looking back at Bash Mitzvah is truly disheartening, as it was an episode that set it self up to be the turning point for pretty much every character\u2019s storyline but ended up being for the most part an empty promise. One of the bigger examples of this would be the final ending of Jandi, as with Jonah seemingly having lost Andi for good now that she had hung out with Walker and realized that a relationship shouldn\u2019t have to be as emotionally draining as hers was with Jonah, and it seemed that unlike last time when she cut Jonah off, Andi was still willing to be with Jonah in a platonic way. This isn\u2019t what happened obviously and the fans were furious. Of course they would be, since the show was so blatantly being lazy when it came to the writing around Jandi. Surely there\u2019s no other reason that the fans would have a problem with alright you know where this is going and we\u2019ll be getting into that next time.\u00a0</p>",
