When you trudged out of your room looking and feeling like death, Jimin immediately went to you.</p><p>\u201cSweetie, are you okay?\u201d He murmured, pulling you close and clasping a hand against your forehead. You whimpered in pain, nodding your head yes despite your other body language that screamed no. \u201cOh no,\u201d Your owner murmured, eyebrows scrunched together.</p><p>\u201cShould I cancel dinner tonight with Taehyung and Hoseok? I can just go pick up Jungkook right now and we\u2019ll stay in today so you don\u2019t have to deal with everything.\u201d Jimin said, in reference to his friend and his hybrid coming over. Jungkook had stayed the night before, and would be coming home with them for dinner as well as to play.</p><p>You immediately shook your head no, causing a shooting pain to float up your spine and into the back of your head. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll feel better by then\u2026 I don\u2019t want you to cancel just because I don\u2019t feel well. You and Jungkook have been excited about this for a while.\u201d You murmured, stomach growling loudly afterward. You were unbelievably hungry.</p><p>Jimin giggled at the sound, bringing a hand up to rub against your head. \u201cIs my bunny hungry? Sit down at the table and rest, I\u2019ll make us some breakfast. How about some pancakes?\u201d Jimin said, instantly making your eyes widen and your mouth salivate. \u201cYes, please!\u201d You said in a rushed manner, moving as quickly to the table as you could.</p><p>\u201cAnything for you!\u201d Jimin told you, immediately getting to work and mixing blueberries into your batter, just the way you liked. As you waited, your pain began to subside. Sometimes it would come back in small spurts, but for the most parts things already began to look up. There were still sharp pains in your stomach sometimes, specifically whenever you\u2019d focus on Jimin, or when you\u2019d speak with him.</p><p>\u201cOrder up!\u201d Jimin said as he placed the steaming plate in front of you. You immediately grabbed for your cutlery and syrup, getting straight to work. \u201cSomeone\u2019s hungry.\u201d Jimin teased, no actual malice in his tone. You nodded shyly, trying to slow yourself down. Your efforts quickly diminished when you had your first bite of the pancakes, ending up finishing them a couple of minutes. Jimin watched you in awe, wondering what you\u2019d done to make you so hungry. When he saw your plate wiped clean, he looked at you questioningly.</p><p>\u201cDo you want more? Usually you don\u2019t eat this much. I don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s good to have a healthy appetite- did Jungkook make dinner for you before he left yesterday?\u201d Jimin asked you. You nodded, not wanting Jungkook to be blamed for your sickness or seemingly endless stomach.</p><p>\u201cHe did! It\u2019s not Jungkook\u2019s fault- I\u2019m sorry, Minie, I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on with me.\u201d You told him honestly, pouting and clasping your hands in your lap. Jimin quickly stood up, grabbing your plate to load it with more food. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be sorry for, Y/N. As long as you\u2019re safe and happy.\u201d Jimin told you, and you knew he was being honest. It helped calm your nerves.</p><p>When Jimin came back with the last of your pancakes, you thanked him graciously. \u201cNo problem, baby.\u201d He murmured, going back to his own food. After that, your stomach had a sharp pain in it again, making you grunt lightly. You stilled for a moment, waiting for it to continue. When it didn\u2019t, you went back to scarfing down your pancakes.</p><p>Once you were satiated, which took about twice the amount of food than normal, you sat back in your chair feeling exhausted. Jimin seemed to notice from his position at the sink, nodding his head toward the bathroom in the hallway. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a shower to get your energy levels back up, Y/N?\u201d Jimin proposed. You nodded at the idea, carefully getting up from your seat and clasping at your stomach, which had been cramping.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go do that.\u201d You told him, going back to your room to pick out your outfit for the day, which would be simple- an over sized sweater and Jungkook\u2019s favorite shorts of yours. You weren\u2019t wearing them for Jungkook- Why would you be? They were just comfy, and you weren\u2019t feeling the best. Yeah.</p><p>The water felt better than usual, and due to that you spent a lot more time in the shower you usually did- spending extra time on your hair, shaving and exfoliating- everything. Once you were out of the shower your skin was soft and rejuvenated, and to top it all off you even lathered yourself up with lotion after brushing your teeth.</p><p>\u201cFelt good, huh?\u201d Jimin asked you when you appeared in the living room. You nodded happily, scampering over to him and sitting on the couch next to him, barely paying any attention to what he was watching on TV. It wasn\u2019t long before you laid yourself in his lap, basking in his warmth as well as his scent. Jimin thought nothing of it, automatically carding his hand into your hair and rubbing at your scalp, something he knew you loved.</p><p>You hummed and sighed in pleasure, eyes falling shut as you basked in the euphoric feeling. Jimin chuckled at your actions, cooing at you. \u201cYou just needed some TLC, huh? Got so lonely without Kookie and I, didn\u2019t you, Y/N?\u201d You nodded your head, nuzzling your face into his thigh as your hips wiggled. As if your shorts weren\u2019t already short enough, your movements began to make them ride farther up, exposing part of your ass to Jimin\u2019s gaze. He bit his lip, trying to avoid indecent thoughts.</p><p>Of course, you were as oblivious as always, nudging yourself farther into his body when his movements stilled. He smiled at you, trying not to focus on your exposed skin, or the fact that your face was deftly close to where his member lay underneath the fabric of his joggers.</p><p>In order to stop the progress of the situation and his thoughts, Jimin brought up a completely un-sexy topic of conversation. \u201cAre you excited for tonight?\u201d Jimin asked you, making your ears twitch. He held in his squeal at your cuteness. You turned your head on his lap to lock eyes with him.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Hoseokie is always super nice to me and he likes to cuddle with me, so that\u2019s good. And Taetae is always super nice to me too, and he gives me lots of compliments.\u201d You pondered. Jimin smiled at how much you craved attention. It was very different from how you acted when you were first adopted, doing anything you could to stay out of the way due to fear of annoying anyone. You were still shy, but you were finally coming around, and it made him happy.</p><p>\u201cOf course Taehyung and Hoseok love you! You\u2019re just so cute, Y/N. It\u2019s impossible not to.\u201d Jimin told you, pulling your hair back from your face so he could see all of your features. You puffed your cheeks out in embarrassment, not being able to handle such a direct complement. \u201cThanks, Jiminie\u2026. You\u2019re the best.\u201d You said shyly, going back to burying your head in his lap and bathing in his attention. Before too long you fell asleep on his lap, and being the considerate owner he was, Jimin let you stay like that for a couple of hours. Well, until he decided he should probably get ready for company, gently shaking your shoulder to wake you up.</p><p>\u201cY/N\u2026 It\u2019s time to get up, baby. I have to get ready and clean the house up a bit.\u201d He told you, cooing when you yawned and rubbed at your eyes. You sat up slowly, gripping at your stomach, which was in even more pain than it was in the morning.</p><p>\u201cOw,\u201d You whimpered, clutching at your stomach over the fabric of your sweat. Jimin leaned over immediately, clasping his hand over your own, making you arch your back into his hand, groaning in pain. \u201cOh god, Y/N, are you okay?\u201d Jimin panicked. You nodded, teary eyed. \u201cI\u2019ll just take some hybrid Tylenol. I\u2019ll be fine, Minie.\u201d You tried to smile, but it came off more like a grimace. Jimin didn\u2019t seem to believe you, but he knew how stubborn you could be, so he went to fetch some water and medicine for you. Everyone would be over in about an hour, and it would\u2019ve been rude to cancel.</p><p>When he came back you were taking deep breaths on the couch, trying to calm the raging pain in your stomach. You hoped it would subside quickly like it did earlier, and that thought was the only thing you were holding on for. \u201cOh, Y/N, I\u2019m so sorry sweetie.\u201d Jimin whined when he saw your state. He gave you the water and held out the pills so you could take them at your own pace, which was a lot slower than usual due to the pain.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2026 \u2018S not your fault.\u201d You breathed through your teeth, trying to smile at him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go set up? I\u2019ll wait here for the pain to pass.\u201d You told him, laying back to try and find a comfortable position and grabbing a throw blanket to cover yourself with.</p><p>Jimin decided to listen to you, giving you a kiss on your forehead before going to clean up any messes as well as changing his clothes. Maybe he\u2019d do some food prep while you were out of commission.</p><p>Truth be told, you were on the couch in pain until about ten minutes before your guests arrived. Once the pain started to subside a generous amount, you sprung up from the couch and folded up your throw blanket, padding along the wooden floors to find your owner. He was putting away the food he prepped, giving you a large smile when he saw you up and moving. Once everything was packed away in the fridge, he walked over to give you a gentle hug.</p><p>\u201cFeeling better?\u201d He murmured into your hair. You nodded as you let him hold you against his chest. \u201cFor now.\u201d You mumbled back, sinking further into his embrace. Jimin would\u2019ve indulged you if it weren\u2019t for a knock on the door, making him tear away from you.</p><p>\u201cComing!\u201d Jimin yelled as he walked to the door, opening it and immediately being engulfed into a hug by Taehyung. Jungkook and Hoseok happily walked by the two\u2019s embrace, sniffing you out and coming to you to greet you. They were smiling, but as they got closer they seemed to become more tense.</p><p>You looked at them curiously, watching as Hoseok\u2019s smile became terse. Even despite the weird aura surrounding him, he still went to pull you into a hug. You always adored the older hybrid, enjoying that he\u2019d indulge in the more childish side of yourself. \u201cHi Hoseokie,\u201d You said happily, wrapping your arms around his neck. He wrapped his arms around your waist, immediately bringing his nose down to your neck so he could scent you. It was something Jungkook always hated, a little pet peeve of his- whenever Hoseok would leave the house he would be all over you, erasing the other hybrid\u2019s smell.</p><p>Nothing was weird about Hoseok\u2019s behavior, until he stood there for longer than he usually did. When Jungkook tried to get closer and say hello to you, a loud growl ripped through Hoseok\u2019s throat. Even with Hoseok being a dog hybrid, Jungkook hardly seemed scared. He seemed mad, actually.</p><p>\u201cSeok,\u201d You could hear Taehyung\u2019s deep voice from behind you. Hoseok reluctantly pulling away from you, giving a side glance to Jungkook before obediently going to join his owner at his side. Jungkook walked over to you, protectively wrapping his arm around your waist while aggressively sniffing at your neck. You could see Jimin\u2019s worry, the emotion very obviously etched across his features. The sudden aggressiveness concerning you made the man uncomfortable, considering it had never been a problem before. Sure, the two would get protective, both being dominant males, but it never felt so tense.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think that was about?\u201d Jimin asked Taehyung as the five of you began migrating to the living room, where everyone decided the movie night would be spent. Taehyung shrugged his shoulders, seeming just as clueless and surprised as your owner. They weren\u2019t alone, because their behavior was confusing, even to you.</p><p>However, within a couple of minutes the awkwardness dissipated and was replaced with excited chatter. There were multiple conversations bouncing forward and backward, some completely odd and others concerning what movies you\u2019d all be watching. Jungkook and Hoseok had practically forced you to sit in between them, something you didn\u2019t have a problem with as long as you got a blanket.</p><p>\u201cWe should watch this one!\u201d Taehyung said loudly, holding up a DVD case. It was supposed to be a romantic movie- well, a romantic comedy, but usually anything in the genre was hardly anything of either. You didn\u2019t really care- ever since you were adopted, you could find yourself becoming interested in all movies, no matter how poor quality it might have been. Jimin groaned, but as soon as Taehyung started to pout he agreed. Giddily, the other man set up the movie, turning off the lamps in the room before jumping onto the couch.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the movie began to follow the same cliche storyline every other romantic movie seemed to follow. As you gained more experience with different movies, you wondered what was so addicting about the combination of events every movie seemed to follow- especially when the formula didn\u2019t guarantee success, or in some cases, even mediocrity.</p><p>You found yourself watching intently, nonetheless. The room was silent except for the comments one of you would make once in a while, the sound and dialogue from the movie filling in the rest of the way. You found yourself leaning your head on Hoseok\u2019s shoulder, simply due to tiredness. Jungkook\u2019s hand found it\u2019s way onto your thigh under the blanket. It wouldn\u2019t have been odd if he\u2019d chosen any other place- on most occasions, Jungkook enjoyed having even a little bit of physical contact. He\u2019d never been the type to latch onto your thigh, though- waist, sure.</p><p>Shooting him a questioning glance only to find his gaze fixated on the TV, you gave a minuscule shrug and went back to watching the movie.</p><p>Except the pain was coming back, and it was hard to focus on anything beside Jungkook\u2019s hand on your thigh. It felt like you were burning, being eaten up on the inside by something less than good. Hoseok\u2019s and Jungkook\u2019s scents flooded your nose, and you wanted to get on the floor. Beg them to do something, beg them to make the pain stop, beg them to make you feel better. How? You weren\u2019t so sure, but every single one of your instincts were telling you that your medicine were the hybrids you were sandwiched in between.</p><p>Hoseok began breathing heavily and Jungkook began to inhale deeply, nostrils flared as his grip on your thigh tightened. You let out a small whimper, whether out of pain or pleasure or desparation you weren\u2019t sure. That seemed to be Hoseok\u2019s breaking point, as he immediately ripped the blanket from you and tore Jungkook\u2019s hand away from you, dragging you into his body as if you weighed nothing.</p><p>And instead of fighting back against the sudden physicality, instead of screaming in fear or yelling in anger, you moaned. The type of moan your whole body went into, and if it were any other time you would\u2019ve been embarrassed, but in that moment you just couldn\u2019t seem to care.</p><p>\u201cGet off her!\u201d Jungkook yelled, practically growling at the way Hoseok handled you, at the way he thought he owned you. You were Jungkook\u2019s doe, not Hoseok\u2019s bitch. He\u2019d make you know it, make everyone in the room know it. He had no problem putting you on your hands and knees, breeding you in front of their prying eyes.</p><p>\u201cWoah- you guys! Stop!\u201d Taehyung and Jimin both yelled, standing abruptly. You were whimpering in Hoseok\u2019s hold, almost drooling by now. \u201cSomeone, please do something. Kookie\u2026\u201d You said lowly. You weren\u2019t even sure what you were asking of him.</p><p>\u201cJimin\u2026 Did you let me bring Hoseok over here while Y/N is in heat?\u201d Taehyung asked astonished, finally putting the puzzle pieces together. Jimin looked mortified, mouth open in a silent gasp as he quickly shook his head. \u201cOh my god- I had no idea! I thought she was sick! Taehyung, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Jimin said desperately, feeling stupid for not realizing your condition earlier. You heard the faint mention of heat, knowing it had something to do with you.</p><p>Taehyung rolled his eyes but didn\u2019t appear mad, putting a hand on Hoseok\u2019s shoulder to calm his hybrid down. \u201cCome on, Hobi. You know you can\u2019t do this, Kookie\u2019s got Y/N claimed already.\u201d Taehyung said softly, making Hoseok frown but comply. He let you go, and Jungkook immediately went to steady you. You went to nosing his neck, sniffing and licking all the skin you could get to as soft moans escaped your throat.</p><p>\u201cTae, I promise I\u2019ll make it up to you\u2026 Once Y/N is okay.\u201d Jimin said sadly. Taehyung threw his head back and laughed, still ushering Hoseok out of the house. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, she\u2019ll be fine\u2026 Now have fun!\u201d He winked before closing the door, leaving Jimin to be flustered in yours and Jungkook\u2019s presence.</p><p>\u201cGonna fuck you so good, bunny\u2026 Gonna fill your sweet little pussy up with my kits, make you nice and full. You want that, baby? Want me to make you feel good? Make you pregnant?\u201d Jungkook was whispering pure filth into your ear. Well, not whispering, considering Jimin could hear it from his position a couple feet away. You were a whimpering mess, barely able to stand if the wobbling of your knees was anything to go off of.</p><p>\u201cKook\u2026\u201d Jimin said, not knowing exactly what he should\u2019ve done. Part of him felt indescribably jealous, the selfish side of him telling him he should get Jungkook away from you and take care of you himself, and the more rational side telling him that the best thing to get you through your first heat was a partner. Specifically, a hybrid partner. Jungkook looked up at him from where he was latched onto your skin, sucking rosy marks all over it.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in heat, hyung. This is something she can\u2019t go through alone- just let me take care of at least the beginning part. I\u2019m not gonna exile you or anything, you can help out later\u2026. Would you like that, pretty bunny? Want Jimin and I to take care of you and stuff you full?\u201d Jungkook trailed off, reaching down to grab a handful of your ass through your silk shorts, making him give a throaty groan.</p><p>Jimin found himself nodding vigorously, excited at the prospect of touching you. He could feel his pants tent when you moaned aloud. \u201cYes, Kookie! Want you and Minie to help me. Make it stop, Kookie.\u201d You whimpered, clawing at the other hybrid\u2019s chest. Jungkook bent down to pick you up, locking your legs around his waist before taking you to your room. You\u2019d be spending a lot of time in there.</p><p>Deciding there was no time for being shy, Jungkook began stripping himself. When he was naked and his cock stood proudly in front of you, you began to moan again, spreading your legs automatically. Jungkook chuckled, climbing onto the bed and getting rid of your clothing as quick as he could. He tapped your clit a couple times, groaning when you began to keen, arching yourself into his touch. Once your clothes were removed you immediately began to roll over and present yourself to him.</p><p>It was a beautiful sight. Jimin had followed the both of you in, taking a seat at the edge of the bed and palming himself over his pants, looking at your pretty pussy dripping with slick. Your back was arched so softly, the plump shape of your ass and the wetness of your cunt being the most inviting sight either of the boys had ever seen.</p><p>When you got no stimulation, you began to wiggle your hips to entice the male, or males, behind you. This sent Jungkook into a frenzy, barely being able to think about anything but grabbing you by the hips and fucking you like you needed him to.</p><p>\u201cSuch a good little doe,\u201d Jungkook said, rubbing the tip of his cock up and down your pussy. You pushed back onto him, trying to do anything to get him inside. Deciding you\u2019d been in pain for more than long enough, Jungkook gave you exactly what you craved and slammed his cock inside your virgin walls, making you cry out in pleasure.</p><p>It should\u2019ve been painful, there should\u2019ve been comfort. Thanks to the heat and your desperate arousal, you only felt pleasure. The older hybrid began an unforgiving pace, pushing into you so hard and deep that you inched up higher on the bed with every thrust.</p><p>\u201cSo tight, baby. Your pussy\u2019s so good, milking my cock just right. You feel good, bunny?\u201d Jungkook asked, leaning over your back and breathing heavily into your ear. There was no way you could find words to response, pleased sounds coming from your lips whenever you opened your mouth.</p><p>It was a shame Jungkook couldn\u2019t see your full face, but Jimin was able to due to his position on the bed. You looked absolutely wrecked in the most beautiful way possible. Hair mussed up from activity, skin glistening with sweat, saliva running down your lips from the stimulation. Your eyes were glossed in what the human could only call euphoria, and it made him want you to be wrecked even more.</p><p>\u201cFuck, I\u2019m gonna cum,\u201d Jungkook breathed harshly, pulling back to put his hand on your hips to intensify his speed. His free hand snaked around the underside of your body, beginning to mercilessly rub at your clit. You whimpered loudly at the feeling. \u201cKookie!\u201d You whined, quickly squeezing tighter around his cock, a clear signal you were going to cum.</p><p>\u201cThat&rsquo;s it baby, cum for me, let go. Milk my cock for everything I\u2019ve got.\u201d Jungkook encouraged you, tone soft despite the absolute filth pouring from his mouth. You did exactly what you were told, body jerking as you were blinded with white due to the sheer power of your orgasm. Jungkook worked you through your high, cumming shortly after you did, filling you up with his cum.</p><p>\u201cGonna make you pregnant, bunny\u2026 Can\u2019t wait to see you so full.\u201d Jungkook moaned, keeping his cock inside you while he calmed down, laying the two of you on your sides so he could pat your belly. When your breathing returned to normal, Jungkook slipped out of you, making you whine at the loss of contact.</p><p>\u201cYou did so good, Y/N.\u201d Jungkook pressed a kiss to your shoulder, moving to sit at the edge of your bed. \u201cJiminie,\u201d You said, reaching out and making grabby hands for him. The heat had calmed down generously but you were still needy as hell. Jimin seemed to sense the desperation in your voice.</p><p>\u201cNot tired yet, huh sweetie?\u201d Jimin said teasingly, silently thanking the powers above. He wouldn\u2019t have encouraged you to continue if you hadn\u2019t wanted to, but he thought he was going to die from blue balls. You nodded in embarrassment, covering your eyes with your arm as you rolled onto your back and spread your legs for him.</p><p>Jungkook\u2019s cum came squelching out of you, running down your pretty, abused folds and painting them translucent white. You could hear Jungkook\u2019s groan of pleasure. Jimin had removed his pants and boxers, pumping his thick cock before he went in. He was sure you could take it, but it was better safe than sorry.</p><p>\u201cLet me see that beautiful face, Y/N.\u201d Jimin cooed, reaching forward and grabbing your arm, not letting it go until it laid at your side. Your eyes were glossy and your cheeks were moist with tears of pleasure. Jimin leaned forward and locked lips with you in a passionate kiss, staying like that for a couple of seconds. He groaned into your mouth, grabbing hold of his cock and positioning it at your hole before pushing in, causing your arch to back as you moaned into him. \u201cIs it good, baby?\u201d Jimin asked you, warm breath fanning over your face as he began more gentle, but still mind blowing pace. You nodded quickly.</p><p>\u201cWords, Y/N. Let hyung know how good he\u2019s making you feel.\u201d Jungkook chastised from the edge of the bed, hand already wrapped around his cock for another go. You bit your lip at the sight before focusing back on Jimin. \u201cIt\u2019s so good, Minie\u2026 Makes me feel so good. It\u2019s so big! You make me so full\u2026\u201d You rambled, throwing your head back as he increased his pace.</p><p>\u201cFuck baby, you\u2019re so good for me. So good for us. You know that? How long we\u2019ve loved you?\u201d Jimin moaned, bringing a hand up to cup your breast and pinch at your nipple. Even through the haze of your heat, you could feel the love Jimin\u2019s words had for you and how much weight they carried. It was such an odd way to confess, yet such a fitting situation for the three of you.</p><p>You moaned aloud at the praise, bringing your own hand up to wrap itself in Jimin\u2019s hair. \u201cI- ugh, I love you guys too,\u201d You keened, hips bucking up in time with Jimin\u2019s thrusts. You could hear Jungkook\u2019s moan of release, a sign that he\u2019d came all over himself. \u201cYou gonna cum again, Y/N? Do it, baby. One more time, you can do it.\u201d Jimn encouraged, finding himself coming dangerously close to his peak. Lucky for him you started spasming immediately after he stopped talking, throwing him into an orgasmic moment. He came inside you, didn\u2019t stop thrusting until you were whining in over stimulation, weakly pushing at his pelvis. He slipped out of you, falling on the bed next to you.</p><p>Jungkook laid on your other side, bringing a blanket over the three of your bodies as you sat in silence, regaining your breath.</p><p>\u201cI meant it.\u201d Jimin said out of nowhere, making you and Jungkook look at him questioningly. \u201cMeant what?\u201d You asked softly. He turned to you, kissing you and leaning over to ruffle Jungkook\u2019s hair. \u201cI love you, and I have for a long time. You too, Kookie.\u201d Jimni said, voice quiet as if he was afraid of rejection. You were surprised at his confession, something that transferred to Jungkook as well.</p><p>\u201cI love you too. Both of you.\u201d You added quietly, holding Jimin\u2019s hand over the blanket to try and ease his anxiety. He pressed a kiss to your forehead. \u201cI, um, you know. I feel the same way.\u201d Jungkook said embarrassed, all of his earlier cockiness leaving him. You giggled, as did Jimin.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jungkook looooves us, Y/N! How cute!\u201d Jimin said, making you laugh out loud. Jungkook rolled his eyes. \u201cI\u2019d totally fight back but I\u2019m beat. Let\u2019s just take a nap in this nasty bed.\u201d He yawned, making you nod in agreement to his notion. Jimin groaned in disgust but made no move to leave, opting to hug your bad as Jungkook did to your front.</p><p>And so, that was how you spent the first night of your heat. Sandwiched between the two men you love.</p><p>Well, until three in the morning- then you had Jimin fuck you with his fingers while Jungkook whispered words of praise into your ear, trying to get you to your peak as fast as possible. Honestly, it was the best night you ever had.</p>",

When you trudged out of your room looking and feeling like death, Jimin immediately went to you.</p><p>\u201cSweetie, are you okay?\u201d He murmured, pulling you close and clasping a hand against your forehead. You whimpered in pain, nodding your head yes despite your other body language that screamed no. \u201cOh no,\u201d Your owner murmured, eyebrows scrunched together.</p><p>\u201cShould I cancel dinner tonight with Taehyung and Hoseok? I can just go pick up Jungkook right now and we\u2019ll stay in today so you don\u2019t have to deal with everything.\u201d Jimin said, in reference to his friend and his hybrid coming over. Jungkook had stayed the night before, and would be coming home with them for dinner as well as to play.</p><p>You immediately shook your head no, causing a shooting pain to float up your spine and into the back of your head. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll feel better by then\u2026 I don\u2019t want you to cancel just because I don\u2019t feel well. You and Jungkook have been excited about this for a while.\u201d You murmured, stomach growling loudly afterward. You were unbelievably hungry.</p><p>Jimin giggled at the sound, bringing a hand up to rub against your head. \u201cIs my bunny hungry? Sit down at the table and rest, I\u2019ll make us some breakfast. How about some pancakes?\u201d Jimin said, instantly making your eyes widen and your mouth salivate. \u201cYes, please!\u201d You said in a rushed manner, moving as quickly to the table as you could.</p><p>\u201cAnything for you!\u201d Jimin told you, immediately getting to work and mixing blueberries into your batter, just the way you liked. As you waited, your pain began to subside. Sometimes it would come back in small spurts, but for the most parts things already began to look up. There were still sharp pains in your stomach sometimes, specifically whenever you\u2019d focus on Jimin, or when you\u2019d speak with him.</p><p>\u201cOrder up!\u201d Jimin said as he placed the steaming plate in front of you. You immediately grabbed for your cutlery and syrup, getting straight to work. \u201cSomeone\u2019s hungry.\u201d Jimin teased, no actual malice in his tone. You nodded shyly, trying to slow yourself down. Your efforts quickly diminished when you had your first bite of the pancakes, ending up finishing them a couple of minutes. Jimin watched you in awe, wondering what you\u2019d done to make you so hungry. When he saw your plate wiped clean, he looked at you questioningly.</p><p>\u201cDo you want more? Usually you don\u2019t eat this much. I don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s good to have a healthy appetite- did Jungkook make dinner for you before he left yesterday?\u201d Jimin asked you. You nodded, not wanting Jungkook to be blamed for your sickness or seemingly endless stomach.</p><p>\u201cHe did! It\u2019s not Jungkook\u2019s fault- I\u2019m sorry, Minie, I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on with me.\u201d You told him honestly, pouting and clasping your hands in your lap. Jimin quickly stood up, grabbing your plate to load it with more food. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be sorry for, Y/N. As long as you\u2019re safe and happy.\u201d Jimin told you, and you knew he was being honest. It helped calm your nerves.</p><p>When Jimin came back with the last of your pancakes, you thanked him graciously. \u201cNo problem, baby.\u201d He murmured, going back to his own food. After that, your stomach had a sharp pain in it again, making you grunt lightly. You stilled for a moment, waiting for it to continue. When it didn\u2019t, you went back to scarfing down your pancakes.</p><p>Once you were satiated, which took about twice the amount of food than normal, you sat back in your chair feeling exhausted. Jimin seemed to notice from his position at the sink, nodding his head toward the bathroom in the hallway. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a shower to get your energy levels back up, Y/N?\u201d Jimin proposed. You nodded at the idea, carefully getting up from your seat and clasping at your stomach, which had been cramping.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go do that.\u201d You told him, going back to your room to pick out your outfit for the day, which would be simple- an over sized sweater and Jungkook\u2019s favorite shorts of yours. You weren\u2019t wearing them for Jungkook- Why would you be? They were just comfy, and you weren\u2019t feeling the best. Yeah.</p><p>The water felt better than usual, and due to that you spent a lot more time in the shower you usually did- spending extra time on your hair, shaving and exfoliating- everything. Once you were out of the shower your skin was soft and rejuvenated, and to top it all off you even lathered yourself up with lotion after brushing your teeth.</p><p>\u201cFelt good, huh?\u201d Jimin asked you when you appeared in the living room. You nodded happily, scampering over to him and sitting on the couch next to him, barely paying any attention to what he was watching on TV. It wasn\u2019t long before you laid yourself in his lap, basking in his warmth as well as his scent. Jimin thought nothing of it, automatically carding his hand into your hair and rubbing at your scalp, something he knew you loved.</p><p>You hummed and sighed in pleasure, eyes falling shut as you basked in the euphoric feeling. Jimin chuckled at your actions, cooing at you. \u201cYou just needed some TLC, huh? Got so lonely without Kookie and I, didn\u2019t you, Y/N?\u201d You nodded your head, nuzzling your face into his thigh as your hips wiggled. As if your shorts weren\u2019t already short enough, your movements began to make them ride farther up, exposing part of your ass to Jimin\u2019s gaze. He bit his lip, trying to avoid indecent thoughts.</p><p>Of course, you were as oblivious as always, nudging yourself farther into his body when his movements stilled. He smiled at you, trying not to focus on your exposed skin, or the fact that your face was deftly close to where his member lay underneath the fabric of his joggers.</p><p>In order to stop the progress of the situation and his thoughts, Jimin brought up a completely un-sexy topic of conversation. \u201cAre you excited for tonight?\u201d Jimin asked you, making your ears twitch. He held in his squeal at your cuteness. You turned your head on his lap to lock eyes with him.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Hoseokie is always super nice to me and he likes to cuddle with me, so that\u2019s good. And Taetae is always super nice to me too, and he gives me lots of compliments.\u201d You pondered. Jimin smiled at how much you craved attention. It was very different from how you acted when you were first adopted, doing anything you could to stay out of the way due to fear of annoying anyone. You were still shy, but you were finally coming around, and it made him happy.</p><p>\u201cOf course Taehyung and Hoseok love you! You\u2019re just so cute, Y/N. It\u2019s impossible not to.\u201d Jimin told you, pulling your hair back from your face so he could see all of your features. You puffed your cheeks out in embarrassment, not being able to handle such a direct complement. \u201cThanks, Jiminie\u2026. You\u2019re the best.\u201d You said shyly, going back to burying your head in his lap and bathing in his attention. Before too long you fell asleep on his lap, and being the considerate owner he was, Jimin let you stay like that for a couple of hours. Well, until he decided he should probably get ready for company, gently shaking your shoulder to wake you up.</p><p>\u201cY/N\u2026 It\u2019s time to get up, baby. I have to get ready and clean the house up a bit.\u201d He told you, cooing when you yawned and rubbed at your eyes. You sat up slowly, gripping at your stomach, which was in even more pain than it was in the morning.</p><p>\u201cOw,\u201d You whimpered, clutching at your stomach over the fabric of your sweat. Jimin leaned over immediately, clasping his hand over your own, making you arch your back into his hand, groaning in pain. \u201cOh god, Y/N, are you okay?\u201d Jimin panicked. You nodded, teary eyed. \u201cI\u2019ll just take some hybrid Tylenol. I\u2019ll be fine, Minie.\u201d You tried to smile, but it came off more like a grimace. Jimin didn\u2019t seem to believe you, but he knew how stubborn you could be, so he went to fetch some water and medicine for you. Everyone would be over in about an hour, and it would\u2019ve been rude to cancel.</p><p>When he came back you were taking deep breaths on the couch, trying to calm the raging pain in your stomach. You hoped it would subside quickly like it did earlier, and that thought was the only thing you were holding on for. \u201cOh, Y/N, I\u2019m so sorry sweetie.\u201d Jimin whined when he saw your state. He gave you the water and held out the pills so you could take them at your own pace, which was a lot slower than usual due to the pain.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2026 \u2018S not your fault.\u201d You breathed through your teeth, trying to smile at him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go set up? I\u2019ll wait here for the pain to pass.\u201d You told him, laying back to try and find a comfortable position and grabbing a throw blanket to cover yourself with.</p><p>Jimin decided to listen to you, giving you a kiss on your forehead before going to clean up any messes as well as changing his clothes. Maybe he\u2019d do some food prep while you were out of commission.</p><p>Truth be told, you were on the couch in pain until about ten minutes before your guests arrived. Once the pain started to subside a generous amount, you sprung up from the couch and folded up your throw blanket, padding along the wooden floors to find your owner. He was putting away the food he prepped, giving you a large smile when he saw you up and moving. Once everything was packed away in the fridge, he walked over to give you a gentle hug.</p><p>\u201cFeeling better?\u201d He murmured into your hair. You nodded as you let him hold you against his chest. \u201cFor now.\u201d You mumbled back, sinking further into his embrace. Jimin would\u2019ve indulged you if it weren\u2019t for a knock on the door, making him tear away from you.</p><p>\u201cComing!\u201d Jimin yelled as he walked to the door, opening it and immediately being engulfed into a hug by Taehyung. Jungkook and Hoseok happily walked by the two\u2019s embrace, sniffing you out and coming to you to greet you. They were smiling, but as they got closer they seemed to become more tense.</p><p>You looked at them curiously, watching as Hoseok\u2019s smile became terse. Even despite the weird aura surrounding him, he still went to pull you into a hug. You always adored the older hybrid, enjoying that he\u2019d indulge in the more childish side of yourself. \u201cHi Hoseokie,\u201d You said happily, wrapping your arms around his neck. He wrapped his arms around your waist, immediately bringing his nose down to your neck so he could scent you. It was something Jungkook always hated, a little pet peeve of his- whenever Hoseok would leave the house he would be all over you, erasing the other hybrid\u2019s smell.</p><p>Nothing was weird about Hoseok\u2019s behavior, until he stood there for longer than he usually did. When Jungkook tried to get closer and say hello to you, a loud growl ripped through Hoseok\u2019s throat. Even with Hoseok being a dog hybrid, Jungkook hardly seemed scared. He seemed mad, actually.</p><p>\u201cSeok,\u201d You could hear Taehyung\u2019s deep voice from behind you. Hoseok reluctantly pulling away from you, giving a side glance to Jungkook before obediently going to join his owner at his side. Jungkook walked over to you, protectively wrapping his arm around your waist while aggressively sniffing at your neck. You could see Jimin\u2019s worry, the emotion very obviously etched across his features. The sudden aggressiveness concerning you made the man uncomfortable, considering it had never been a problem before. Sure, the two would get protective, both being dominant males, but it never felt so tense.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think that was about?\u201d Jimin asked Taehyung as the five of you began migrating to the living room, where everyone decided the movie night would be spent. Taehyung shrugged his shoulders, seeming just as clueless and surprised as your owner. They weren\u2019t alone, because their behavior was confusing, even to you.</p><p>However, within a couple of minutes the awkwardness dissipated and was replaced with excited chatter. There were multiple conversations bouncing forward and backward, some completely odd and others concerning what movies you\u2019d all be watching. Jungkook and Hoseok had practically forced you to sit in between them, something you didn\u2019t have a problem with as long as you got a blanket.</p><p>\u201cWe should watch this one!\u201d Taehyung said loudly, holding up a DVD case. It was supposed to be a romantic movie- well, a romantic comedy, but usually anything in the genre was hardly anything of either. You didn\u2019t really care- ever since you were adopted, you could find yourself becoming interested in all movies, no matter how poor quality it might have been. Jimin groaned, but as soon as Taehyung started to pout he agreed. Giddily, the other man set up the movie, turning off the lamps in the room before jumping onto the couch.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the movie began to follow the same cliche storyline every other romantic movie seemed to follow. As you gained more experience with different movies, you wondered what was so addicting about the combination of events every movie seemed to follow- especially when the formula didn\u2019t guarantee success, or in some cases, even mediocrity.</p><p>You found yourself watching intently, nonetheless. The room was silent except for the comments one of you would make once in a while, the sound and dialogue from the movie filling in the rest of the way. You found yourself leaning your head on Hoseok\u2019s shoulder, simply due to tiredness. Jungkook\u2019s hand found it\u2019s way onto your thigh under the blanket. It wouldn\u2019t have been odd if he\u2019d chosen any other place- on most occasions, Jungkook enjoyed having even a little bit of physical contact. He\u2019d never been the type to latch onto your thigh, though- waist, sure.</p><p>Shooting him a questioning glance only to find his gaze fixated on the TV, you gave a minuscule shrug and went back to watching the movie.</p><p>Except the pain was coming back, and it was hard to focus on anything beside Jungkook\u2019s hand on your thigh. It felt like you were burning, being eaten up on the inside by something less than good. Hoseok\u2019s and Jungkook\u2019s scents flooded your nose, and you wanted to get on the floor. Beg them to do something, beg them to make the pain stop, beg them to make you feel better. How? You weren\u2019t so sure, but every single one of your instincts were telling you that your medicine were the hybrids you were sandwiched in between.</p><p>Hoseok began breathing heavily and Jungkook began to inhale deeply, nostrils flared as his grip on your thigh tightened. You let out a small whimper, whether out of pain or pleasure or desparation you weren\u2019t sure. That seemed to be Hoseok\u2019s breaking point, as he immediately ripped the blanket from you and tore Jungkook\u2019s hand away from you, dragging you into his body as if you weighed nothing.</p><p>And instead of fighting back against the sudden physicality, instead of screaming in fear or yelling in anger, you moaned. The type of moan your whole body went into, and if it were any other time you would\u2019ve been embarrassed, but in that moment you just couldn\u2019t seem to care.</p><p>\u201cGet off her!\u201d Jungkook yelled, practically growling at the way Hoseok handled you, at the way he thought he owned you. You were Jungkook\u2019s doe, not Hoseok\u2019s bitch. He\u2019d make you know it, make everyone in the room know it. He had no problem putting you on your hands and knees, breeding you in front of their prying eyes.</p><p>\u201cWoah- you guys! Stop!\u201d Taehyung and Jimin both yelled, standing abruptly. You were whimpering in Hoseok\u2019s hold, almost drooling by now. \u201cSomeone, please do something. Kookie\u2026\u201d You said lowly. You weren\u2019t even sure what you were asking of him.</p><p>\u201cJimin\u2026 Did you let me bring Hoseok over here while Y/N is in heat?\u201d Taehyung asked astonished, finally putting the puzzle pieces together. Jimin looked mortified, mouth open in a silent gasp as he quickly shook his head. \u201cOh my god- I had no idea! I thought she was sick! Taehyung, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Jimin said desperately, feeling stupid for not realizing your condition earlier. You heard the faint mention of heat, knowing it had something to do with you.</p><p>Taehyung rolled his eyes but didn\u2019t appear mad, putting a hand on Hoseok\u2019s shoulder to calm his hybrid down. \u201cCome on, Hobi. You know you can\u2019t do this, Kookie\u2019s got Y/N claimed already.\u201d Taehyung said softly, making Hoseok frown but comply. He let you go, and Jungkook immediately went to steady you. You went to nosing his neck, sniffing and licking all the skin you could get to as soft moans escaped your throat.</p><p>\u201cTae, I promise I\u2019ll make it up to you\u2026 Once Y/N is okay.\u201d Jimin said sadly. Taehyung threw his head back and laughed, still ushering Hoseok out of the house. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, she\u2019ll be fine\u2026 Now have fun!\u201d He winked before closing the door, leaving Jimin to be flustered in yours and Jungkook\u2019s presence.</p><p>\u201cGonna fuck you so good, bunny\u2026 Gonna fill your sweet little pussy up with my kits, make you nice and full. You want that, baby? Want me to make you feel good? Make you pregnant?\u201d Jungkook was whispering pure filth into your ear. Well, not whispering, considering Jimin could hear it from his position a couple feet away. You were a whimpering mess, barely able to stand if the wobbling of your knees was anything to go off of.</p><p>\u201cKook\u2026\u201d Jimin said, not knowing exactly what he should\u2019ve done. Part of him felt indescribably jealous, the selfish side of him telling him he should get Jungkook away from you and take care of you himself, and the more rational side telling him that the best thing to get you through your first heat was a partner. Specifically, a hybrid partner. Jungkook looked up at him from where he was latched onto your skin, sucking rosy marks all over it.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in heat, hyung. This is something she can\u2019t go through alone- just let me take care of at least the beginning part. I\u2019m not gonna exile you or anything, you can help out later\u2026. Would you like that, pretty bunny? Want Jimin and I to take care of you and stuff you full?\u201d Jungkook trailed off, reaching down to grab a handful of your ass through your silk shorts, making him give a throaty groan.</p><p>Jimin found himself nodding vigorously, excited at the prospect of touching you. He could feel his pants tent when you moaned aloud. \u201cYes, Kookie! Want you and Minie to help me. Make it stop, Kookie.\u201d You whimpered, clawing at the other hybrid\u2019s chest. Jungkook bent down to pick you up, locking your legs around his waist before taking you to your room. You\u2019d be spending a lot of time in there.</p><p>Deciding there was no time for being shy, Jungkook began stripping himself. When he was naked and his cock stood proudly in front of you, you began to moan again, spreading your legs automatically. Jungkook chuckled, climbing onto the bed and getting rid of your clothing as quick as he could. He tapped your clit a couple times, groaning when you began to keen, arching yourself into his touch. Once your clothes were removed you immediately began to roll over and present yourself to him.</p><p>It was a beautiful sight. Jimin had followed the both of you in, taking a seat at the edge of the bed and palming himself over his pants, looking at your pretty pussy dripping with slick. Your back was arched so softly, the plump shape of your ass and the wetness of your cunt being the most inviting sight either of the boys had ever seen.</p><p>When you got no stimulation, you began to wiggle your hips to entice the male, or males, behind you. This sent Jungkook into a frenzy, barely being able to think about anything but grabbing you by the hips and fucking you like you needed him to.</p><p>\u201cSuch a good little doe,\u201d Jungkook said, rubbing the tip of his cock up and down your pussy. You pushed back onto him, trying to do anything to get him inside. Deciding you\u2019d been in pain for more than long enough, Jungkook gave you exactly what you craved and slammed his cock inside your virgin walls, making you cry out in pleasure.</p><p>It should\u2019ve been painful, there should\u2019ve been comfort. Thanks to the heat and your desperate arousal, you only felt pleasure. The older hybrid began an unforgiving pace, pushing into you so hard and deep that you inched up higher on the bed with every thrust.</p><p>\u201cSo tight, baby. Your pussy\u2019s so good, milking my cock just right. You feel good, bunny?\u201d Jungkook asked, leaning over your back and breathing heavily into your ear. There was no way you could find words to response, pleased sounds coming from your lips whenever you opened your mouth.</p><p>It was a shame Jungkook couldn\u2019t see your full face, but Jimin was able to due to his position on the bed. You looked absolutely wrecked in the most beautiful way possible. Hair mussed up from activity, skin glistening with sweat, saliva running down your lips from the stimulation. Your eyes were glossed in what the human could only call euphoria, and it made him want you to be wrecked even more.</p><p>\u201cFuck, I\u2019m gonna cum,\u201d Jungkook breathed harshly, pulling back to put his hand on your hips to intensify his speed. His free hand snaked around the underside of your body, beginning to mercilessly rub at your clit. You whimpered loudly at the feeling. \u201cKookie!\u201d You whined, quickly squeezing tighter around his cock, a clear signal you were going to cum.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it baby, cum for me, let go. Milk my cock for everything I\u2019ve got.\u201d Jungkook encouraged you, tone soft despite the absolute filth pouring from his mouth. You did exactly what you were told, body jerking as you were blinded with white due to the sheer power of your orgasm. Jungkook worked you through your high, cumming shortly after you did, filling you up with his cum.</p><p>\u201cGonna make you pregnant, bunny\u2026 Can\u2019t wait to see you so full.\u201d Jungkook moaned, keeping his cock inside you while he calmed down, laying the two of you on your sides so he could pat your belly. When your breathing returned to normal, Jungkook slipped out of you, making you whine at the loss of contact.</p><p>\u201cYou did so good, Y/N.\u201d Jungkook pressed a kiss to your shoulder, moving to sit at the edge of your bed. \u201cJiminie,\u201d You said, reaching out and making grabby hands for him. The heat had calmed down generously but you were still needy as hell. Jimin seemed to sense the desperation in your voice.</p><p>\u201cNot tired yet, huh sweetie?\u201d Jimin said teasingly, silently thanking the powers above. He wouldn\u2019t have encouraged you to continue if you hadn\u2019t wanted to, but he thought he was going to die from blue balls. You nodded in embarrassment, covering your eyes with your arm as you rolled onto your back and spread your legs for him.</p><p>Jungkook\u2019s cum came squelching out of you, running down your pretty, abused folds and painting them translucent white. You could hear Jungkook\u2019s groan of pleasure. Jimin had removed his pants and boxers, pumping his thick cock before he went in. He was sure you could take it, but it was better safe than sorry.</p><p>\u201cLet me see that beautiful face, Y/N.\u201d Jimin cooed, reaching forward and grabbing your arm, not letting it go until it laid at your side. Your eyes were glossy and your cheeks were moist with tears of pleasure. Jimin leaned forward and locked lips with you in a passionate kiss, staying like that for a couple of seconds. He groaned into your mouth, grabbing hold of his cock and positioning it at your hole before pushing in, causing your arch to back as you moaned into him. \u201cIs it good, baby?\u201d Jimin asked you, warm breath fanning over your face as he began more gentle, but still mind blowing pace. You nodded quickly.</p><p>\u201cWords, Y/N. Let hyung know how good he\u2019s making you feel.\u201d Jungkook chastised from the edge of the bed, hand already wrapped around his cock for another go. You bit your lip at the sight before focusing back on Jimin. \u201cIt\u2019s so good, Minie\u2026 Makes me feel so good. It\u2019s so big! You make me so full\u2026\u201d You rambled, throwing your head back as he increased his pace.</p><p>\u201cFuck baby, you\u2019re so good for me. So good for us. You know that? How long we\u2019ve loved you?\u201d Jimin moaned, bringing a hand up to cup your breast and pinch at your nipple. Even through the haze of your heat, you could feel the love Jimin\u2019s words had for you and how much weight they carried. It was such an odd way to confess, yet such a fitting situation for the three of you.</p><p>You moaned aloud at the praise, bringing your own hand up to wrap itself in Jimin\u2019s hair. \u201cI- ugh, I love you guys too,\u201d You keened, hips bucking up in time with Jimin\u2019s thrusts. You could hear Jungkook\u2019s moan of release, a sign that he\u2019d came all over himself. \u201cYou gonna cum again, Y/N? Do it, baby. One more time, you can do it.\u201d Jimn encouraged, finding himself coming dangerously close to his peak. Lucky for him you started spasming immediately after he stopped talking, throwing him into an orgasmic moment. He came inside you, didn\u2019t stop thrusting until you were whining in over stimulation, weakly pushing at his pelvis. He slipped out of you, falling on the bed next to you.</p><p>Jungkook laid on your other side, bringing a blanket over the three of your bodies as you sat in silence, regaining your breath.</p><p>\u201cI meant it.\u201d Jimin said out of nowhere, making you and Jungkook look at him questioningly. \u201cMeant what?\u201d You asked softly. He turned to you, kissing you and leaning over to ruffle Jungkook\u2019s hair. \u201cI love you, and I have for a long time. You too, Kookie.\u201d Jimni said, voice quiet as if he was afraid of rejection. You were surprised at his confession, something that transferred to Jungkook as well.</p><p>\u201cI love you too. Both of you.\u201d You added quietly, holding Jimin\u2019s hand over the blanket to try and ease his anxiety. He pressed a kiss to your forehead. \u201cI, um, you know. I feel the same way.\u201d Jungkook said embarrassed, all of his earlier cockiness leaving him. You giggled, as did Jimin.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jungkook looooves us, Y/N! How cute!\u201d Jimin said, making you laugh out loud. Jungkook rolled his eyes. \u201cI\u2019d totally fight back but I\u2019m beat. Let\u2019s just take a nap in this nasty bed.\u201d He yawned, making you nod in agreement to his notion. Jimin groaned in disgust but made no move to leave, opting to hug your bad as Jungkook did to your front.</p><p>And so, that was how you spent the first night of your heat. Sandwiched between the two men you love.</p><p>Well, until three in the morning- then you had Jimin fuck you with his fingers while Jungkook whispered words of praise into your ear, trying to get you to your peak as fast as possible. Honestly, it was the best night you ever had.</p></p>",

When you trudged out of your room looking and feeling like death, Jimin immediately went to you.</p><p>\u201cSweetie, are you okay?\u201d He murmured, pulling you close and clasping a hand against your forehead. You whimpered in pain, nodding your head yes despite your other body language that screamed no. \u201cOh no,\u201d Your owner murmured, eyebrows scrunched together.</p><p>\u201cShould I cancel dinner tonight with Taehyung and Hoseok? I can just go pick up Jungkook right now and we\u2019ll stay in today so you don\u2019t have to deal with everything.\u201d Jimin said, in reference to his friend and his hybrid coming over. Jungkook had stayed the night before, and would be coming home with them for dinner as well as to play.</p><p>You immediately shook your head no, causing a shooting pain to float up your spine and into the back of your head. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll feel better by then\u2026 I don\u2019t want you to cancel just because I don\u2019t feel well. You and Jungkook have been excited about this for a while.\u201d You murmured, stomach growling loudly afterward. You were unbelievably hungry.</p><p>Jimin giggled at the sound, bringing a hand up to rub against your head. \u201cIs my bunny hungry? Sit down at the table and rest, I\u2019ll make us some breakfast. How about some pancakes?\u201d Jimin said, instantly making your eyes widen and your mouth salivate. \u201cYes, please!\u201d You said in a rushed manner, moving as quickly to the table as you could.</p><p>\u201cAnything for you!\u201d Jimin told you, immediately getting to work and mixing blueberries into your batter, just the way you liked. As you waited, your pain began to subside. Sometimes it would come back in small spurts, but for the most parts things already began to look up. There were still sharp pains in your stomach sometimes, specifically whenever you\u2019d focus on Jimin, or when you\u2019d speak with him.</p><p>\u201cOrder up!\u201d Jimin said as he placed the steaming plate in front of you. You immediately grabbed for your cutlery and syrup, getting straight to work. \u201cSomeone\u2019s hungry.\u201d Jimin teased, no actual malice in his tone. You nodded shyly, trying to slow yourself down. Your efforts quickly diminished when you had your first bite of the pancakes, ending up finishing them a couple of minutes. Jimin watched you in awe, wondering what you\u2019d done to make you so hungry. When he saw your plate wiped clean, he looked at you questioningly.</p><p>\u201cDo you want more? Usually you don\u2019t eat this much. I don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s good to have a healthy appetite- did Jungkook make dinner for you before he left yesterday?\u201d Jimin asked you. You nodded, not wanting Jungkook to be blamed for your sickness or seemingly endless stomach.</p><p>\u201cHe did! It\u2019s not Jungkook\u2019s fault- I\u2019m sorry, Minie, I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on with me.\u201d You told him honestly, pouting and clasping your hands in your lap. Jimin quickly stood up, grabbing your plate to load it with more food. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be sorry for, Y/N. As long as you\u2019re safe and happy.\u201d Jimin told you, and you knew he was being honest. It helped calm your nerves.</p><p>When Jimin came back with the last of your pancakes, you thanked him graciously. \u201cNo problem, baby.\u201d He murmured, going back to his own food. After that, your stomach had a sharp pain in it again, making you grunt lightly. You stilled for a moment, waiting for it to continue. When it didn\u2019t, you went back to scarfing down your pancakes.</p><p>Once you were satiated, which took about twice the amount of food than normal, you sat back in your chair feeling exhausted. Jimin seemed to notice from his position at the sink, nodding his head toward the bathroom in the hallway. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a shower to get your energy levels back up, Y/N?\u201d Jimin proposed. You nodded at the idea, carefully getting up from your seat and clasping at your stomach, which had been cramping.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go do that.\u201d You told him, going back to your room to pick out your outfit for the day, which would be simple- an over sized sweater and Jungkook\u2019s favorite shorts of yours. You weren\u2019t wearing them for Jungkook- Why would you be? They were just comfy, and you weren\u2019t feeling the best. Yeah.</p><p>The water felt better than usual, and due to that you spent a lot more time in the shower you usually did- spending extra time on your hair, shaving and exfoliating- everything. Once you were out of the shower your skin was soft and rejuvenated, and to top it all off you even lathered yourself up with lotion after brushing your teeth.</p><p>\u201cFelt good, huh?\u201d Jimin asked you when you appeared in the living room. You nodded happily, scampering over to him and sitting on the couch next to him, barely paying any attention to what he was watching on TV. It wasn\u2019t long before you laid yourself in his lap, basking in his warmth as well as his scent. Jimin thought nothing of it, automatically carding his hand into your hair and rubbing at your scalp, something he knew you loved.</p><p>You hummed and sighed in pleasure, eyes falling shut as you basked in the euphoric feeling. Jimin chuckled at your actions, cooing at you. \u201cYou just needed some TLC, huh? Got so lonely without Kookie and I, didn\u2019t you, Y/N?\u201d You nodded your head, nuzzling your face into his thigh as your hips wiggled. As if your shorts weren\u2019t already short enough, your movements began to make them ride farther up, exposing part of your ass to Jimin\u2019s gaze. He bit his lip, trying to avoid indecent thoughts.</p><p>Of course, you were as oblivious as always, nudging yourself farther into his body when his movements stilled. He smiled at you, trying not to focus on your exposed skin, or the fact that your face was deftly close to where his member lay underneath the fabric of his joggers.</p><p>In order to stop the progress of the situation and his thoughts, Jimin brought up a completely un-sexy topic of conversation. \u201cAre you excited for tonight?\u201d Jimin asked you, making your ears twitch. He held in his squeal at your cuteness. You turned your head on his lap to lock eyes with him.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Hoseokie is always super nice to me and he likes to cuddle with me, so that\u2019s good. And Taetae is always super nice to me too, and he gives me lots of compliments.\u201d You pondered. Jimin smiled at how much you craved attention. It was very different from how you acted when you were first adopted, doing anything you could to stay out of the way due to fear of annoying anyone. You were still shy, but you were finally coming around, and it made him happy.</p><p>\u201cOf course Taehyung and Hoseok love you! You\u2019re just so cute, Y/N. It\u2019s impossible not to.\u201d Jimin told you, pulling your hair back from your face so he could see all of your features. You puffed your cheeks out in embarrassment, not being able to handle such a direct complement. \u201cThanks, Jiminie\u2026. You\u2019re the best.\u201d You said shyly, going back to burying your head in his lap and bathing in his attention. Before too long you fell asleep on his lap, and being the considerate owner he was, Jimin let you stay like that for a couple of hours. Well, until he decided he should probably get ready for company, gently shaking your shoulder to wake you up.</p><p>\u201cY/N\u2026 It\u2019s time to get up, baby. I have to get ready and clean the house up a bit.\u201d He told you, cooing when you yawned and rubbed at your eyes. You sat up slowly, gripping at your stomach, which was in even more pain than it was in the morning.</p><p>\u201cOw,\u201d You whimpered, clutching at your stomach over the fabric of your sweat. Jimin leaned over immediately, clasping his hand over your own, making you arch your back into his hand, groaning in pain. \u201cOh god, Y/N, are you okay?\u201d Jimin panicked. You nodded, teary eyed. \u201cI\u2019ll just take some hybrid Tylenol. I\u2019ll be fine, Minie.\u201d You tried to smile, but it came off more like a grimace. Jimin didn\u2019t seem to believe you, but he knew how stubborn you could be, so he went to fetch some water and medicine for you. Everyone would be over in about an hour, and it would\u2019ve been rude to cancel.</p><p>When he came back you were taking deep breaths on the couch, trying to calm the raging pain in your stomach. You hoped it would subside quickly like it did earlier, and that thought was the only thing you were holding on for. \u201cOh, Y/N, I\u2019m so sorry sweetie.\u201d Jimin whined when he saw your state. He gave you the water and held out the pills so you could take them at your own pace, which was a lot slower than usual due to the pain.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2026 \u2018S not your fault.\u201d You breathed through your teeth, trying to smile at him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go set up? I\u2019ll wait here for the pain to pass.\u201d You told him, laying back to try and find a comfortable position and grabbing a throw blanket to cover yourself with.</p><p>Jimin decided to listen to you, giving you a kiss on your forehead before going to clean up any messes as well as changing his clothes. Maybe he\u2019d do some food prep while you were out of commission.</p><p>Truth be told, you were on the couch in pain until about ten minutes before your guests arrived. Once the pain started to subside a generous amount, you sprung up from the couch and folded up your throw blanket, padding along the wooden floors to find your owner. He was putting away the food he prepped, giving you a large smile when he saw you up and moving. Once everything was packed away in the fridge, he walked over to give you a gentle hug.</p><p>\u201cFeeling better?\u201d He murmured into your hair. You nodded as you let him hold you against his chest. \u201cFor now.\u201d You mumbled back, sinking further into his embrace. Jimin would\u2019ve indulged you if it weren\u2019t for a knock on the door, making him tear away from you.</p><p>\u201cComing!\u201d Jimin yelled as he walked to the door, opening it and immediately being engulfed into a hug by Taehyung. Jungkook and Hoseok happily walked by the two\u2019s embrace, sniffing you out and coming to you to greet you. They were smiling, but as they got closer they seemed to become more tense.</p><p>You looked at them curiously, watching as Hoseok\u2019s smile became terse. Even despite the weird aura surrounding him, he still went to pull you into a hug. You always adored the older hybrid, enjoying that he\u2019d indulge in the more childish side of yourself. \u201cHi Hoseokie,\u201d You said happily, wrapping your arms around his neck. He wrapped his arms around your waist, immediately bringing his nose down to your neck so he could scent you. It was something Jungkook always hated, a little pet peeve of his- whenever Hoseok would leave the house he would be all over you, erasing the other hybrid\u2019s smell.</p><p>Nothing was weird about Hoseok\u2019s behavior, until he stood there for longer than he usually did. When Jungkook tried to get closer and say hello to you, a loud growl ripped through Hoseok\u2019s throat. Even with Hoseok being a dog hybrid, Jungkook hardly seemed scared. He seemed mad, actually.</p><p>\u201cSeok,\u201d You could hear Taehyung\u2019s deep voice from behind you. Hoseok reluctantly pulling away from you, giving a side glance to Jungkook before obediently going to join his owner at his side. Jungkook walked over to you, protectively wrapping his arm around your waist while aggressively sniffing at your neck. You could see Jimin\u2019s worry, the emotion very obviously etched across his features. The sudden aggressiveness concerning you made the man uncomfortable, considering it had never been a problem before. Sure, the two would get protective, both being dominant males, but it never felt so tense.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think that was about?\u201d Jimin asked Taehyung as the five of you began migrating to the living room, where everyone decided the movie night would be spent. Taehyung shrugged his shoulders, seeming just as clueless and surprised as your owner. They weren\u2019t alone, because their behavior was confusing, even to you.</p><p>However, within a couple of minutes the awkwardness dissipated and was replaced with excited chatter. There were multiple conversations bouncing forward and backward, some completely odd and others concerning what movies you\u2019d all be watching. Jungkook and Hoseok had practically forced you to sit in between them, something you didn\u2019t have a problem with as long as you got a blanket.</p><p>\u201cWe should watch this one!\u201d Taehyung said loudly, holding up a DVD case. It was supposed to be a romantic movie- well, a romantic comedy, but usually anything in the genre was hardly anything of either. You didn\u2019t really care- ever since you were adopted, you could find yourself becoming interested in all movies, no matter how poor quality it might have been. Jimin groaned, but as soon as Taehyung started to pout he agreed. Giddily, the other man set up the movie, turning off the lamps in the room before jumping onto the couch.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the movie began to follow the same cliche storyline every other romantic movie seemed to follow. As you gained more experience with different movies, you wondered what was so addicting about the combination of events every movie seemed to follow- especially when the formula didn\u2019t guarantee success, or in some cases, even mediocrity.</p><p>You found yourself watching intently, nonetheless. The room was silent except for the comments one of you would make once in a while, the sound and dialogue from the movie filling in the rest of the way. You found yourself leaning your head on Hoseok\u2019s shoulder, simply due to tiredness. Jungkook\u2019s hand found it\u2019s way onto your thigh under the blanket. It wouldn\u2019t have been odd if he\u2019d chosen any other place- on most occasions, Jungkook enjoyed having even a little bit of physical contact. He\u2019d never been the type to latch onto your thigh, though- waist, sure.</p><p>Shooting him a questioning glance only to find his gaze fixated on the TV, you gave a minuscule shrug and went back to watching the movie.</p><p>Except the pain was coming back, and it was hard to focus on anything beside Jungkook\u2019s hand on your thigh. It felt like you were burning, being eaten up on the inside by something less than good. Hoseok\u2019s and Jungkook\u2019s scents flooded your nose, and you wanted to get on the floor. Beg them to do something, beg them to make the pain stop, beg them to make you feel better. How? You weren\u2019t so sure, but every single one of your instincts were telling you that your medicine were the hybrids you were sandwiched in between.</p><p>Hoseok began breathing heavily and Jungkook began to inhale deeply, nostrils flared as his grip on your thigh tightened. You let out a small whimper, whether out of pain or pleasure or desparation you weren\u2019t sure. That seemed to be Hoseok\u2019s breaking point, as he immediately ripped the blanket from you and tore Jungkook\u2019s hand away from you, dragging you into his body as if you weighed nothing.</p><p>And instead of fighting back against the sudden physicality, instead of screaming in fear or yelling in anger, you moaned. The type of moan your whole body went into, and if it were any other time you would\u2019ve been embarrassed, but in that moment you just couldn\u2019t seem to care.</p><p>\u201cGet off her!\u201d Jungkook yelled, practically growling at the way Hoseok handled you, at the way he thought he owned you. You were Jungkook\u2019s doe, not Hoseok\u2019s bitch. He\u2019d make you know it, make everyone in the room know it. He had no problem putting you on your hands and knees, breeding you in front of their prying eyes.</p><p>\u201cWoah- you guys! Stop!\u201d Taehyung and Jimin both yelled, standing abruptly. You were whimpering in Hoseok\u2019s hold, almost drooling by now. \u201cSomeone, please do something. Kookie\u2026\u201d You said lowly. You weren\u2019t even sure what you were asking of him.</p><p>\u201cJimin\u2026 Did you let me bring Hoseok over here while Y/N is in heat?\u201d Taehyung asked astonished, finally putting the puzzle pieces together. Jimin looked mortified, mouth open in a silent gasp as he quickly shook his head. \u201cOh my god- I had no idea! I thought she was sick! Taehyung, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Jimin said desperately, feeling stupid for not realizing your condition earlier. You heard the faint mention of heat, knowing it had something to do with you.</p><p>Taehyung rolled his eyes but didn\u2019t appear mad, putting a hand on Hoseok\u2019s shoulder to calm his hybrid down. \u201cCome on, Hobi. You know you can\u2019t do this, Kookie\u2019s got Y/N claimed already.\u201d Taehyung said softly, making Hoseok frown but comply. He let you go, and Jungkook immediately went to steady you. You went to nosing his neck, sniffing and licking all the skin you could get to as soft moans escaped your throat.</p><p>\u201cTae, I promise I\u2019ll make it up to you\u2026 Once Y/N is okay.\u201d Jimin said sadly. Taehyung threw his head back and laughed, still ushering Hoseok out of the house. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, she\u2019ll be fine\u2026 Now have fun!\u201d He winked before closing the door, leaving Jimin to be flustered in yours and Jungkook\u2019s presence.</p><p>\u201cGonna fuck you so good, bunny\u2026 Gonna fill your sweet little pussy up with my kits, make you nice and full. You want that, baby? Want me to make you feel good? Make you pregnant?\u201d Jungkook was whispering pure filth into your ear. Well, not whispering, considering Jimin could hear it from his position a couple feet away. You were a whimpering mess, barely able to stand if the wobbling of your knees was anything to go off of.</p><p>\u201cKook\u2026\u201d Jimin said, not knowing exactly what he should\u2019ve done. Part of him felt indescribably jealous, the selfish side of him telling him he should get Jungkook away from you and take care of you himself, and the more rational side telling him that the best thing to get you through your first heat was a partner. Specifically, a hybrid partner. Jungkook looked up at him from where he was latched onto your skin, sucking rosy marks all over it.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in heat, hyung. This is something she can\u2019t go through alone- just let me take care of at least the beginning part. I\u2019m not gonna exile you or anything, you can help out later\u2026. Would you like that, pretty bunny? Want Jimin and I to take care of you and stuff you full?\u201d Jungkook trailed off, reaching down to grab a handful of your ass through your silk shorts, making him give a throaty groan.</p><p>Jimin found himself nodding vigorously, excited at the prospect of touching you. He could feel his pants tent when you moaned aloud. \u201cYes, Kookie! Want you and Minie to help me. Make it stop, Kookie.\u201d You whimpered, clawing at the other hybrid\u2019s chest. Jungkook bent down to pick you up, locking your legs around his waist before taking you to your room. You\u2019d be spending a lot of time in there.</p><p>Deciding there was no time for being shy, Jungkook began stripping himself. When he was naked and his cock stood proudly in front of you, you began to moan again, spreading your legs automatically. Jungkook chuckled, climbing onto the bed and getting rid of your clothing as quick as he could. He tapped your clit a couple times, groaning when you began to keen, arching yourself into his touch. Once your clothes were removed you immediately began to roll over and present yourself to him.</p><p>It was a beautiful sight. Jimin had followed the both of you in, taking a seat at the edge of the bed and palming himself over his pants, looking at your pretty pussy dripping with slick. Your back was arched so softly, the plump shape of your ass and the wetness of your cunt being the most inviting sight either of the boys had ever seen.</p><p>When you got no stimulation, you began to wiggle your hips to entice the male, or males, behind you. This sent Jungkook into a frenzy, barely being able to think about anything but grabbing you by the hips and fucking you like you needed him to.</p><p>\u201cSuch a good little doe,\u201d Jungkook said, rubbing the tip of his cock up and down your pussy. You pushed back onto him, trying to do anything to get him inside. Deciding you\u2019d been in pain for more than long enough, Jungkook gave you exactly what you craved and slammed his cock inside your virgin walls, making you cry out in pleasure.</p><p>It should\u2019ve been painful, there should\u2019ve been comfort. Thanks to the heat and your desperate arousal, you only felt pleasure. The older hybrid began an unforgiving pace, pushing into you so hard and deep that you inched up higher on the bed with every thrust.</p><p>\u201cSo tight, baby. Your pussy\u2019s so good, milking my cock just right. You feel good, bunny?\u201d Jungkook asked, leaning over your back and breathing heavily into your ear. There was no way you could find words to response, pleased sounds coming from your lips whenever you opened your mouth.</p><p>It was a shame Jungkook couldn\u2019t see your full face, but Jimin was able to due to his position on the bed. You looked absolutely wrecked in the most beautiful way possible. Hair mussed up from activity, skin glistening with sweat, saliva running down your lips from the stimulation. Your eyes were glossed in what the human could only call euphoria, and it made him want you to be wrecked even more.</p><p>\u201cFuck, I\u2019m gonna cum,\u201d Jungkook breathed harshly, pulling back to put his hand on your hips to intensify his speed. His free hand snaked around the underside of your body, beginning to mercilessly rub at your clit. You whimpered loudly at the feeling. \u201cKookie!\u201d You whined, quickly squeezing tighter around his cock, a clear signal you were going to cum.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it baby, cum for me, let go. Milk my cock for everything I\u2019ve got.\u201d Jungkook encouraged you, tone soft despite the absolute filth pouring from his mouth. You did exactly what you were told, body jerking as you were blinded with white due to the sheer power of your orgasm. Jungkook worked you through your high, cumming shortly after you did, filling you up with his cum.</p><p>\u201cGonna make you pregnant, bunny\u2026 Can\u2019t wait to see you so full.\u201d Jungkook moaned, keeping his cock inside you while he calmed down, laying the two of you on your sides so he could pat your belly. When your breathing returned to normal, Jungkook slipped out of you, making you whine at the loss of contact.</p><p>\u201cYou did so good, Y/N.\u201d Jungkook pressed a kiss to your shoulder, moving to sit at the edge of your bed. \u201cJiminie,\u201d You said, reaching out and making grabby hands for him. The heat had calmed down generously but you were still needy as hell. Jimin seemed to sense the desperation in your voice.</p><p>\u201cNot tired yet, huh sweetie?\u201d Jimin said teasingly, silently thanking the powers above. He wouldn\u2019t have encouraged you to continue if you hadn\u2019t wanted to, but he thought he was going to die from blue balls. You nodded in embarrassment, covering your eyes with your arm as you rolled onto your back and spread your legs for him.</p><p>Jungkook\u2019s cum came squelching out of you, running down your pretty, abused folds and painting them translucent white. You could hear Jungkook\u2019s groan of pleasure. Jimin had removed his pants and boxers, pumping his thick cock before he went in. He was sure you could take it, but it was better safe than sorry.</p><p>\u201cLet me see that beautiful face, Y/N.\u201d Jimin cooed, reaching forward and grabbing your arm, not letting it go until it laid at your side. Your eyes were glossy and your cheeks were moist with tears of pleasure. Jimin leaned forward and locked lips with you in a passionate kiss, staying like that for a couple of seconds. He groaned into your mouth, grabbing hold of his cock and positioning it at your hole before pushing in, causing your arch to back as you moaned into him. \u201cIs it good, baby?\u201d Jimin asked you, warm breath fanning over your face as he began more gentle, but still mind blowing pace. You nodded quickly.</p><p>\u201cWords, Y/N. Let hyung know how good he\u2019s making you feel.\u201d Jungkook chastised from the edge of the bed, hand already wrapped around his cock for another go. You bit your lip at the sight before focusing back on Jimin. \u201cIt\u2019s so good, Minie\u2026 Makes me feel so good. It\u2019s so big! You make me so full\u2026\u201d You rambled, throwing your head back as he increased his pace.</p><p>\u201cFuck baby, you\u2019re so good for me. So good for us. You know that? How long we\u2019ve loved you?\u201d Jimin moaned, bringing a hand up to cup your breast and pinch at your nipple. Even through the haze of your heat, you could feel the love Jimin\u2019s words had for you and how much weight they carried. It was such an odd way to confess, yet such a fitting situation for the three of you.</p><p>You moaned aloud at the praise, bringing your own hand up to wrap itself in Jimin\u2019s hair. \u201cI- ugh, I love you guys too,\u201d You keened, hips bucking up in time with Jimin\u2019s thrusts. You could hear Jungkook\u2019s moan of release, a sign that he\u2019d came all over himself. \u201cYou gonna cum again, Y/N? Do it, baby. One more time, you can do it.\u201d Jimn encouraged, finding himself coming dangerously close to his peak. Lucky for him you started spasming immediately after he stopped talking, throwing him into an orgasmic moment. He came inside you, didn\u2019t stop thrusting until you were whining in over stimulation, weakly pushing at his pelvis. He slipped out of you, falling on the bed next to you.</p><p>Jungkook laid on your other side, bringing a blanket over the three of your bodies as you sat in silence, regaining your breath.</p><p>\u201cI meant it.\u201d Jimin said out of nowhere, making you and Jungkook look at him questioningly. \u201cMeant what?\u201d You asked softly. He turned to you, kissing you and leaning over to ruffle Jungkook\u2019s hair. \u201cI love you, and I have for a long time. You too, Kookie.\u201d Jimni said, voice quiet as if he was afraid of rejection. You were surprised at his confession, something that transferred to Jungkook as well.</p><p>\u201cI love you too. Both of you.\u201d You added quietly, holding Jimin\u2019s hand over the blanket to try and ease his anxiety. He pressed a kiss to your forehead. \u201cI, um, you know. I feel the same way.\u201d Jungkook said embarrassed, all of his earlier cockiness leaving him. You giggled, as did Jimin.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jungkook looooves us, Y/N! How cute!\u201d Jimin said, making you laugh out loud. Jungkook rolled his eyes. \u201cI\u2019d totally fight back but I\u2019m beat. Let\u2019s just take a nap in this nasty bed.\u201d He yawned, making you nod in agreement to his notion. Jimin groaned in disgust but made no move to leave, opting to hug your bad as Jungkook did to your front.</p><p>And so, that was how you spent the first night of your heat. Sandwiched between the two men you love.</p><p>Well, until three in the morning- then you had Jimin fuck you with his fingers while Jungkook whispered words of praise into your ear, trying to get you to your peak as fast as possible. Honestly, it was the best night you ever had.</p></p>",

When you trudged out of your room looking and feeling like death, Jimin immediately went to you.</p><p>&ldquo;Sweetie, are you okay?&rdquo; He murmured, pulling you close and clasping a hand against your forehead. You whimpered in pain, nodding your head yes despite your other body language that screamed no. &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; Your owner murmured, eyebrows scrunched together.</p><p>&ldquo;Should I cancel dinner tonight with Taehyung and Hoseok? I can just go pick up Jungkook right now and we&rsquo;ll stay in today so you don&rsquo;t have to deal with everything.&rdquo; Jimin said, in reference to his friend and his hybrid coming over. Jungkook had stayed the night before, and would be coming home with them for dinner as well as to play.</p><p>You immediately shook your head no, causing a shooting pain to float up your spine and into the back of your head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll feel better by then&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want you to cancel just because I don&rsquo;t feel well. You and Jungkook have been excited about this for a while.&rdquo; You murmured, stomach growling loudly afterward. You were unbelievably hungry.</p><p>Jimin giggled at the sound, bringing a hand up to rub against your head. &ldquo;Is my bunny hungry? Sit down at the table and rest, I&rsquo;ll make us some breakfast. How about some pancakes?&rdquo; Jimin said, instantly making your eyes widen and your mouth salivate. &ldquo;Yes, please!&rdquo; You said in a rushed manner, moving as quickly to the table as you could.</p><p>&ldquo;Anything for you!&rdquo; Jimin told you, immediately getting to work and mixing blueberries into your batter, just the way you liked. As you waited, your pain began to subside. Sometimes it would come back in small spurts, but for the most parts things already began to look up. There were still sharp pains in your stomach sometimes, specifically whenever you&rsquo;d focus on Jimin, or when you&rsquo;d speak with him.</p><p>&ldquo;Order up!&rdquo; Jimin said as he placed the steaming plate in front of you. You immediately grabbed for your cutlery and syrup, getting straight to work. &ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s hungry.&rdquo; Jimin teased, no actual malice in his tone. You nodded shyly, trying to slow yourself down. Your efforts quickly diminished when you had your first bite of the pancakes, ending up finishing them a couple of minutes. Jimin watched you in awe, wondering what you&rsquo;d done to make you so hungry. When he saw your plate wiped clean, he looked at you questioningly.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want more? Usually you don&rsquo;t eat this much. I don&rsquo;t mind, it&rsquo;s good to have a healthy appetite- did Jungkook make dinner for you before he left yesterday?&rdquo; Jimin asked you. You nodded, not wanting Jungkook to be blamed for your sickness or seemingly endless stomach.</p><p>&ldquo;He did! It&rsquo;s not Jungkook&rsquo;s fault- I&rsquo;m sorry, Minie, I don&rsquo;t really know what&rsquo;s going on with me.&rdquo; You told him honestly, pouting and clasping your hands in your lap. Jimin quickly stood up, grabbing your plate to load it with more food. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to be sorry for, Y/N. As long as you&rsquo;re safe and happy.&rdquo; Jimin told you, and you knew he was being honest. It helped calm your nerves.</p><p>When Jimin came back with the last of your pancakes, you thanked him graciously. &ldquo;No problem, baby.&rdquo; He murmured, going back to his own food. After that, your stomach had a sharp pain in it again, making you grunt lightly. You stilled for a moment, waiting for it to continue. When it didn&rsquo;t, you went back to scarfing down your pancakes.</p><p>Once you were satiated, which took about twice the amount of food than normal, you sat back in your chair feeling exhausted. Jimin seemed to notice from his position at the sink, nodding his head toward the bathroom in the hallway. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you take a shower to get your energy levels back up, Y/N?&rdquo; Jimin proposed. You nodded at the idea, carefully getting up from your seat and clasping at your stomach, which had been cramping.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll go do that.&rdquo; You told him, going back to your room to pick out your outfit for the day, which would be simple- an over sized sweater and Jungkook&rsquo;s favorite shorts of yours. You weren&rsquo;t wearing them for Jungkook- Why would you be? They were just comfy, and you weren&rsquo;t feeling the best. Yeah.</p><p>The water felt better than usual, and due to that you spent a lot more time in the shower you usually did- spending extra time on your hair, shaving and exfoliating- everything. Once you were out of the shower your skin was soft and rejuvenated, and to top it all off you even lathered yourself up with lotion after brushing your teeth.</p><p>&ldquo;Felt good, huh?&rdquo; Jimin asked you when you appeared in the living room. You nodded happily, scampering over to him and sitting on the couch next to him, barely paying any attention to what he was watching on TV. It wasn&rsquo;t long before you laid yourself in his lap, basking in his warmth as well as his scent. Jimin thought nothing of it, automatically carding his hand into your hair and rubbing at your scalp, something he knew you loved.</p><p>You hummed and sighed in pleasure, eyes falling shut as you basked in the euphoric feeling. Jimin chuckled at your actions, cooing at you. &ldquo;You just needed some TLC, huh? Got so lonely without Kookie and I, didn&rsquo;t you, Y/N?&rdquo; You nodded your head, nuzzling your face into his thigh as your hips wiggled. As if your shorts weren&rsquo;t already short enough, your movements began to make them ride farther up, exposing part of your ass to Jimin&rsquo;s gaze. He bit his lip, trying to avoid indecent thoughts.</p><p>Of course, you were as oblivious as always, nudging yourself farther into his body when his movements stilled. He smiled at you, trying not to focus on your exposed skin, or the fact that your face was deftly close to where his member lay underneath the fabric of his joggers.</p><p>In order to stop the progress of the situation and his thoughts, Jimin brought up a completely un-sexy topic of conversation. &ldquo;Are you excited for tonight?&rdquo; Jimin asked you, making your ears twitch. He held in his squeal at your cuteness. You turned your head on his lap to lock eyes with him.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Hoseokie is always super nice to me and he likes to cuddle with me, so that&rsquo;s good. And Taetae is always super nice to me too, and he gives me lots of compliments.&rdquo; You pondered. Jimin smiled at how much you craved attention. It was very different from how you acted when you were first adopted, doing anything you could to stay out of the way due to fear of annoying anyone. You were still shy, but you were finally coming around, and it made him happy.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course Taehyung and Hoseok love you! You&rsquo;re just so cute, Y/N. It&rsquo;s impossible not to.&rdquo; Jimin told you, pulling your hair back from your face so he could see all of your features. You puffed your cheeks out in embarrassment, not being able to handle such a direct complement. &ldquo;Thanks, Jiminie&hellip;. You&rsquo;re the best.&rdquo; You said shyly, going back to burying your head in his lap and bathing in his attention. Before too long you fell asleep on his lap, and being the considerate owner he was, Jimin let you stay like that for a couple of hours. Well, until he decided he should probably get ready for company, gently shaking your shoulder to wake you up.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N&hellip; It&rsquo;s time to get up, baby. I have to get ready and clean the house up a bit.&rdquo; He told you, cooing when you yawned and rubbed at your eyes. You sat up slowly, gripping at your stomach, which was in even more pain than it was in the morning.</p><p>&ldquo;Ow,&rdquo; You whimpered, clutching at your stomach over the fabric of your sweat. Jimin leaned over immediately, clasping his hand over your own, making you arch your back into his hand, groaning in pain. &ldquo;Oh god, Y/N, are you okay?&rdquo; Jimin panicked. You nodded, teary eyed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just take some hybrid Tylenol. I&rsquo;ll be fine, Minie.&rdquo; You tried to smile, but it came off more like a grimace. Jimin didn&rsquo;t seem to believe you, but he knew how stubborn you could be, so he went to fetch some water and medicine for you. Everyone would be over in about an hour, and it would&rsquo;ve been rude to cancel.</p><p>When he came back you were taking deep breaths on the couch, trying to calm the raging pain in your stomach. You hoped it would subside quickly like it did earlier, and that thought was the only thing you were holding on for. &ldquo;Oh, Y/N, I&rsquo;m so sorry sweetie.&rdquo; Jimin whined when he saw your state. He gave you the water and held out the pills so you could take them at your own pace, which was a lot slower than usual due to the pain.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry&hellip; &lsquo;S not your fault.&rdquo; You breathed through your teeth, trying to smile at him. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go set up? I&rsquo;ll wait here for the pain to pass.&rdquo; You told him, laying back to try and find a comfortable position and grabbing a throw blanket to cover yourself with.</p><p>Jimin decided to listen to you, giving you a kiss on your forehead before going to clean up any messes as well as changing his clothes. Maybe he&rsquo;d do some food prep while you were out of commission.</p><p>Truth be told, you were on the couch in pain until about ten minutes before your guests arrived. Once the pain started to subside a generous amount, you sprung up from the couch and folded up your throw blanket, padding along the wooden floors to find your owner. He was putting away the food he prepped, giving you a large smile when he saw you up and moving. Once everything was packed away in the fridge, he walked over to give you a gentle hug.</p><p>&ldquo;Feeling better?&rdquo; He murmured into your hair. You nodded as you let him hold you against his chest. &ldquo;For now.&rdquo; You mumbled back, sinking further into his embrace. Jimin would&rsquo;ve indulged you if it weren&rsquo;t for a knock on the door, making him tear away from you.</p><p>&ldquo;Coming!&rdquo; Jimin yelled as he walked to the door, opening it and immediately being engulfed into a hug by Taehyung. Jungkook and Hoseok happily walked by the two&rsquo;s embrace, sniffing you out and coming to you to greet you. They were smiling, but as they got closer they seemed to become more tense.</p><p>You looked at them curiously, watching as Hoseok&rsquo;s smile became terse. Even despite the weird aura surrounding him, he still went to pull you into a hug. You always adored the older hybrid, enjoying that he&rsquo;d indulge in the more childish side of yourself. &ldquo;Hi Hoseokie,&rdquo; You said happily, wrapping your arms around his neck. He wrapped his arms around your waist, immediately bringing his nose down to your neck so he could scent you. It was something Jungkook always hated, a little pet peeve of his- whenever Hoseok would leave the house he would be all over you, erasing the other hybrid&rsquo;s smell.</p><p>Nothing was weird about Hoseok&rsquo;s behavior, until he stood there for longer than he usually did. When Jungkook tried to get closer and say hello to you, a loud growl ripped through Hoseok&rsquo;s throat. Even with Hoseok being a dog hybrid, Jungkook hardly seemed scared. He seemed mad, actually.</p><p>&ldquo;Seok,&rdquo; You could hear Taehyung&rsquo;s deep voice from behind you. Hoseok reluctantly pulling away from you, giving a side glance to Jungkook before obediently going to join his owner at his side. Jungkook walked over to you, protectively wrapping his arm around your waist while aggressively sniffing at your neck. You could see Jimin&rsquo;s worry, the emotion very obviously etched across his features. The sudden aggressiveness concerning you made the man uncomfortable, considering it had never been a problem before. Sure, the two would get protective, both being dominant males, but it never felt so tense.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you think that was about?&rdquo; Jimin asked Taehyung as the five of you began migrating to the living room, where everyone decided the movie night would be spent. Taehyung shrugged his shoulders, seeming just as clueless and surprised as your owner. They weren&rsquo;t alone, because their behavior was confusing, even to you.</p><p>However, within a couple of minutes the awkwardness dissipated and was replaced with excited chatter. There were multiple conversations bouncing forward and backward, some completely odd and others concerning what movies you&rsquo;d all be watching. Jungkook and Hoseok had practically forced you to sit in between them, something you didn&rsquo;t have a problem with as long as you got a blanket.</p><p>&ldquo;We should watch this one!&rdquo; Taehyung said loudly, holding up a DVD case. It was supposed to be a romantic movie- well, a romantic comedy, but usually anything in the genre was hardly anything of either. You didn&rsquo;t really care- ever since you were adopted, you could find yourself becoming interested in all movies, no matter how poor quality it might have been. Jimin groaned, but as soon as Taehyung started to pout he agreed. Giddily, the other man set up the movie, turning off the lamps in the room before jumping onto the couch.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the movie began to follow the same cliche storyline every other romantic movie seemed to follow. As you gained more experience with different movies, you wondered what was so addicting about the combination of events every movie seemed to follow- especially when the formula didn&rsquo;t guarantee success, or in some cases, even mediocrity.</p><p>You found yourself watching intently, nonetheless. The room was silent except for the comments one of you would make once in a while, the sound and dialogue from the movie filling in the rest of the way. You found yourself leaning your head on Hoseok&rsquo;s shoulder, simply due to tiredness. Jungkook&rsquo;s hand found it&rsquo;s way onto your thigh under the blanket. It wouldn&rsquo;t have been odd if he&rsquo;d chosen any other place- on most occasions, Jungkook enjoyed having even a little bit of physical contact. He&rsquo;d never been the type to latch onto your thigh, though- waist, sure.</p><p>Shooting him a questioning glance only to find his gaze fixated on the TV, you gave a minuscule shrug and went back to watching the movie.</p><p>Except the pain was coming back, and it was hard to focus on anything beside Jungkook&rsquo;s hand on your thigh. It felt like you were burning, being eaten up on the inside by something less than good. Hoseok&rsquo;s and Jungkook&rsquo;s scents flooded your nose, and you wanted to get on the floor. Beg them to do something, beg them to make the pain stop, beg them to make you feel better. How? You weren&rsquo;t so sure, but every single one of your instincts were telling you that your medicine were the hybrids you were sandwiched in between.</p><p>Hoseok began breathing heavily and Jungkook began to inhale deeply, nostrils flared as his grip on your thigh tightened. You let out a small whimper, whether out of pain or pleasure or desparation you weren&rsquo;t sure. That seemed to be Hoseok&rsquo;s breaking point, as he immediately ripped the blanket from you and tore Jungkook&rsquo;s hand away from you, dragging you into his body as if you weighed nothing.</p><p>And instead of fighting back against the sudden physicality, instead of screaming in fear or yelling in anger, you moaned. The type of moan your whole body went into, and if it were any other time you would&rsquo;ve been embarrassed, but in that moment you just couldn&rsquo;t seem to care.</p><p>&ldquo;Get off her!&rdquo; Jungkook yelled, practically growling at the way Hoseok handled you, at the way he thought he owned you. You were Jungkook&rsquo;s doe, not Hoseok&rsquo;s bitch. He&rsquo;d make you know it, make everyone in the room know it. He had no problem putting you on your hands and knees, breeding you in front of their prying eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Woah- you guys! Stop!&rdquo; Taehyung and Jimin both yelled, standing abruptly. You were whimpering in Hoseok&rsquo;s hold, almost drooling by now. &ldquo;Someone, please do something. Kookie&hellip;&rdquo; You said lowly. You weren&rsquo;t even sure what you were asking of him.</p><p>&ldquo;Jimin&hellip; Did you let me bring Hoseok over here while Y/N is in heat?&rdquo; Taehyung asked astonished, finally putting the puzzle pieces together. Jimin looked mortified, mouth open in a silent gasp as he quickly shook his head. &ldquo;Oh my god- I had no idea! I thought she was sick! Taehyung, I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo; Jimin said desperately, feeling stupid for not realizing your condition earlier. You heard the faint mention of heat, knowing it had something to do with you.</p><p>Taehyung rolled his eyes but didn&rsquo;t appear mad, putting a hand on Hoseok&rsquo;s shoulder to calm his hybrid down. &ldquo;Come on, Hobi. You know you can&rsquo;t do this, Kookie&rsquo;s got Y/N claimed already.&rdquo; Taehyung said softly, making Hoseok frown but comply. He let you go, and Jungkook immediately went to steady you. You went to nosing his neck, sniffing and licking all the skin you could get to as soft moans escaped your throat.</p><p>&ldquo;Tae, I promise I&rsquo;ll make it up to you&hellip; Once Y/N is okay.&rdquo; Jimin said sadly. Taehyung threw his head back and laughed, still ushering Hoseok out of the house. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, she&rsquo;ll be fine&hellip; Now have fun!&rdquo; He winked before closing the door, leaving Jimin to be flustered in yours and Jungkook&rsquo;s presence.</p><p>&ldquo;Gonna fuck you so good, bunny&hellip; Gonna fill your sweet little pussy up with my kits, make you nice and full. You want that, baby? Want me to make you feel good? Make you pregnant?&rdquo; Jungkook was whispering pure filth into your ear. Well, not whispering, considering Jimin could hear it from his position a couple feet away. You were a whimpering mess, barely able to stand if the wobbling of your knees was anything to go off of.</p><p>&ldquo;Kook&hellip;&rdquo; Jimin said, not knowing exactly what he should&rsquo;ve done. Part of him felt indescribably jealous, the selfish side of him telling him he should get Jungkook away from you and take care of you himself, and the more rational side telling him that the best thing to get you through your first heat was a partner. Specifically, a hybrid partner. Jungkook looked up at him from where he was latched onto your skin, sucking rosy marks all over it.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in heat, hyung. This is something she can&rsquo;t go through alone- just let me take care of at least the beginning part. I&rsquo;m not gonna exile you or anything, you can help out later&hellip;. Would you like that, pretty bunny? Want Jimin and I to take care of you and stuff you full?&rdquo; Jungkook trailed off, reaching down to grab a handful of your ass through your silk shorts, making him give a throaty groan.</p><p>Jimin found himself nodding vigorously, excited at the prospect of touching you. He could feel his pants tent when you moaned aloud. &ldquo;Yes, Kookie! Want you and Minie to help me. Make it stop, Kookie.&rdquo; You whimpered, clawing at the other hybrid&rsquo;s chest. Jungkook bent down to pick you up, locking your legs around his waist before taking you to your room. You&rsquo;d be spending a lot of time in there.</p><p>Deciding there was no time for being shy, Jungkook began stripping himself. When he was naked and his cock stood proudly in front of you, you began to moan again, spreading your legs automatically. Jungkook chuckled, climbing onto the bed and getting rid of your clothing as quick as he could. He tapped your clit a couple times, groaning when you began to keen, arching yourself into his touch. Once your clothes were removed you immediately began to roll over and present yourself to him.</p><p>It was a beautiful sight. Jimin had followed the both of you in, taking a seat at the edge of the bed and palming himself over his pants, looking at your pretty pussy dripping with slick. Your back was arched so softly, the plump shape of your ass and the wetness of your cunt being the most inviting sight either of the boys had ever seen.</p><p>When you got no stimulation, you began to wiggle your hips to entice the male, or males, behind you. This sent Jungkook into a frenzy, barely being able to think about anything but grabbing you by the hips and fucking you like you needed him to.</p><p>&ldquo;Such a good little doe,&rdquo; Jungkook said, rubbing the tip of his cock up and down your pussy. You pushed back onto him, trying to do anything to get him inside. Deciding you&rsquo;d been in pain for more than long enough, Jungkook gave you exactly what you craved and slammed his cock inside your virgin walls, making you cry out in pleasure.</p><p>It should&rsquo;ve been painful, there should&rsquo;ve been comfort. Thanks to the heat and your desperate arousal, you only felt pleasure. The older hybrid began an unforgiving pace, pushing into you so hard and deep that you inched up higher on the bed with every thrust.</p><p>&ldquo;So tight, baby. Your pussy&rsquo;s so good, milking my cock just right. You feel good, bunny?&rdquo; Jungkook asked, leaning over your back and breathing heavily into your ear. There was no way you could find words to response, pleased sounds coming from your lips whenever you opened your mouth.</p><p>It was a shame Jungkook couldn&rsquo;t see your full face, but Jimin was able to due to his position on the bed. You looked absolutely wrecked in the most beautiful way possible. Hair mussed up from activity, skin glistening with sweat, saliva running down your lips from the stimulation. Your eyes were glossed in what the human could only call euphoria, and it made him want you to be wrecked even more.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, I&rsquo;m gonna cum,&rdquo; Jungkook breathed harshly, pulling back to put his hand on your hips to intensify his speed. His free hand snaked around the underside of your body, beginning to mercilessly rub at your clit. You whimpered loudly at the feeling. &ldquo;Kookie!&rdquo; You whined, quickly squeezing tighter around his cock, a clear signal you were going to cum.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it baby, cum for me, let go. Milk my cock for everything I&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo; Jungkook encouraged you, tone soft despite the absolute filth pouring from his mouth. You did exactly what you were told, body jerking as you were blinded with white due to the sheer power of your orgasm. Jungkook worked you through your high, cumming shortly after you did, filling you up with his cum.</p><p>&ldquo;Gonna make you pregnant, bunny&hellip; Can&rsquo;t wait to see you so full.&rdquo; Jungkook moaned, keeping his cock inside you while he calmed down, laying the two of you on your sides so he could pat your belly. When your breathing returned to normal, Jungkook slipped out of you, making you whine at the loss of contact.</p><p>&ldquo;You did so good, Y/N.&rdquo; Jungkook pressed a kiss to your shoulder, moving to sit at the edge of your bed. &ldquo;Jiminie,&rdquo; You said, reaching out and making grabby hands for him. The heat had calmed down generously but you were still needy as hell. Jimin seemed to sense the desperation in your voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Not tired yet, huh sweetie?&rdquo; Jimin said teasingly, silently thanking the powers above. He wouldn&rsquo;t have encouraged you to continue if you hadn&rsquo;t wanted to, but he thought he was going to die from blue balls. You nodded in embarrassment, covering your eyes with your arm as you rolled onto your back and spread your legs for him.</p><p>Jungkook&rsquo;s cum came squelching out of you, running down your pretty, abused folds and painting them translucent white. You could hear Jungkook&rsquo;s groan of pleasure. Jimin had removed his pants and boxers, pumping his thick cock before he went in. He was sure you could take it, but it was better safe than sorry.</p><p>&ldquo;Let me see that beautiful face, Y/N.&rdquo; Jimin cooed, reaching forward and grabbing your arm, not letting it go until it laid at your side. Your eyes were glossy and your cheeks were moist with tears of pleasure. Jimin leaned forward and locked lips with you in a passionate kiss, staying like that for a couple of seconds. He groaned into your mouth, grabbing hold of his cock and positioning it at your hole before pushing in, causing your arch to back as you moaned into him. &ldquo;Is it good, baby?&rdquo; Jimin asked you, warm breath fanning over your face as he began more gentle, but still mind blowing pace. You nodded quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;Words, Y/N. Let hyung know how good he&rsquo;s making you feel.&rdquo; Jungkook chastised from the edge of the bed, hand already wrapped around his cock for another go. You bit your lip at the sight before focusing back on Jimin. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so good, Minie&hellip; Makes me feel so good. It&rsquo;s so big! You make me so full&hellip;&rdquo; You rambled, throwing your head back as he increased his pace.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck baby, you&rsquo;re so good for me. So good for us. You know that? How long we&rsquo;ve loved you?&rdquo; Jimin moaned, bringing a hand up to cup your breast and pinch at your nipple. Even through the haze of your heat, you could feel the love Jimin&rsquo;s words had for you and how much weight they carried. It was such an odd way to confess, yet such a fitting situation for the three of you.</p><p>You moaned aloud at the praise, bringing your own hand up to wrap itself in Jimin&rsquo;s hair. &ldquo;I- ugh, I love you guys too,&rdquo; You keened, hips bucking up in time with Jimin&rsquo;s thrusts. You could hear Jungkook&rsquo;s moan of release, a sign that he&rsquo;d came all over himself. &ldquo;You gonna cum again, Y/N? Do it, baby. One more time, you can do it.&rdquo; Jimn encouraged, finding himself coming dangerously close to his peak. Lucky for him you started spasming immediately after he stopped talking, throwing him into an orgasmic moment. He came inside you, didn&rsquo;t stop thrusting until you were whining in over stimulation, weakly pushing at his pelvis. He slipped out of you, falling on the bed next to you.</p><p>Jungkook laid on your other side, bringing a blanket over the three of your bodies as you sat in silence, regaining your breath.</p><p>&ldquo;I meant it.&rdquo; Jimin said out of nowhere, making you and Jungkook look at him questioningly. &ldquo;Meant what?&rdquo; You asked softly. He turned to you, kissing you and leaning over to ruffle Jungkook&rsquo;s hair. &ldquo;I love you, and I have for a long time. You too, Kookie.&rdquo; Jimni said, voice quiet as if he was afraid of rejection. You were surprised at his confession, something that transferred to Jungkook as well.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too. Both of you.&rdquo; You added quietly, holding Jimin&rsquo;s hand over the blanket to try and ease his anxiety. He pressed a kiss to your forehead. &ldquo;I, um, you know. I feel the same way.&rdquo; Jungkook said embarrassed, all of his earlier cockiness leaving him. You giggled, as did Jimin.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Jungkook looooves us, Y/N! How cute!&rdquo; Jimin said, making you laugh out loud. Jungkook rolled his eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d totally fight back but I&rsquo;m beat. Let&rsquo;s just take a nap in this nasty bed.&rdquo; He yawned, making you nod in agreement to his notion. Jimin groaned in disgust but made no move to leave, opting to hug your bad as Jungkook did to your front.</p><p>And so, that was how you spent the first night of your heat. Sandwiched between the two men you love.</p><p>Well, until three in the morning- then you had Jimin fuck you with his fingers while Jungkook whispered words of praise into your ear, trying to get you to your peak as fast as possible. Honestly, it was the best night you ever had.</p></p>",
