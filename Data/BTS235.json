Yeji\n\u2013said best friend- was preparing food for the three little demons she had to\ntake care of. Babysitting Jungkook, Jimin, and Taehyung was her job in her free\ntime since the parents of all three of the tiny humans worked together and were\naway most of the time. She had raised those kids since they were born, and now\nJimin (or Chimmy) and Taehyung (Tata for a very specific group of friends) were\nseven years old and Kookie was five. She adored them, and Namjoon with the rest\nof the group loved them too, but they were too proud to ever admit that. Except\nfor Hoseok. He had no pride in the matter.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">An hour or\nso later, and after the three balls of energy were asleep, Yeji sat on the\ncarpet next to Namjoon and watched him as he played his game passionately. He\nhad his excessively long brown hair on a ponytail to keep them from falling\nover his eyes, something that the rest of the group found hilarious. The door\nunlocked and Yoongi walked in, looking like a zombie. Namjoon felt his cheeks\nburning and the other boy stopped for a moment</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cHey\u201d he\nmumbled and had to contain his smile at the sight of the boy\u2019s hair \u201cDidn\u2019t\nknow you\u2019d be here\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Namjoon\nkept playing even though his mind was somewhere else entirely \u201cYeah, Yeji\nneeded some help with the little ones\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">She smiled\nevilly and then looked over at Yoongi \u201cGo leave your stuff and wash your hands,\nfood is ready in a bit\u201d as soon as he left the room, she faced Namjoon \u201cPlease\nconfess already\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cWhat?!\u201d he\nexclaimed \u201cNo way!\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cWhy not?\u201d\nshe smirked and tilted her head playfully</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cBecause\nI\u2019m awkward and he\u2019s being just a bit more comfortable around me and I don\u2019t\nwanna screw that up\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cYou do\nrealize that he\u2019s more comfortable because you\u2019ve shown signs that you like\nhim, right?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cYou can\u2019t\nbe so sure\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cHoney,\nI\u2019ve known him since he was born. Literally. We\u2019re living together for the last\nfifteen years. I know him better than he knows himself right now. I might be\nten years older than you guys but I\u2019m not old enough to be completely blind.\nAnd he spends most of the day here so he talks to me. Like, a lot\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">That seemed\nto capture the boy\u2019s attention \u201cDid he say anything about me?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">She laughed\n\u201cYou\u2019re crazy if you think that I\u2019d betray my little bro like that\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He pouted\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you told him everything I\u2019ve ever said to you\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">She gasped\ndramatically \u201cHow dare you question my loyalty? I haven\u2019t said a word!\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">They both\nlaughed and Yoongi sat next to Namjoon with a long sigh after a few moments\n\u201cWhat are we laughing about?\u201d he asked tiredly</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cNamjoon\ncompletely failing at this game\u201d Yeji smiled and got up \u201cIs anyone else\ncoming?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Yoongi\nlooked up from his phone \u201cUh, I think Hobi is\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Yeji rolled\nher eyes \u201cOf course he is\u201d </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cOh, and I\nthink Jin is coming too\u201d added Namjoon without taking his eyes from the screen</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">She stared\nat them \u201cI love it when you invite yourselves over\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">They both\nsmiled with puppy eyes that made her melt and drop her tough fa\u00e7ade. She cursed\nfondly under her breath as she dragged them both into the kitchen to help her\nout preparing food for four very hungry teenagers. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">***</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cSo, uh, in\nshort, well, what I called you here for, uh-\u201c</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cAre you\nbreaking up with me?\u201d Yoongi cut him off</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">They were\nsitting at the small table at Yeji\u2019s place, keeping an eye on the little ones\neven though they were still sleeping. The others had to go shopping, so they\nshouldn\u2019t be back for at least another hour. Yoongi was wearing an oversized\npink hoodie that he had stolen from Yeji, and Namjoon felt his soul leave his\nbody when he saw him in it. He looked like a fluffy marshmallow with his cute\nblack bed hair and pouty lips. One thing he absolutely loved about him was the\nway his lips pouted every time he talked, or how his eyes lit up when he asked\nsomething and the answer would surprise him even in the slightest. What he\ndidn\u2019t know, was that Yoongi absolutely adored his dimples. And his big ass\neyes that gave him the feeling that they actually held stars in them, even\nthough that wasn\u2019t even possible. And he loved how clumsy he could get,\nespecially when he got nervous about anything, or how his voice was raspy and\ndeep in the morning, and how soft he sounded when humming his favorite songs,\nor how ridiculously good he looked in his big ass glasses</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Namjoon\nlooked at him completely lost \u201cWait, we\u2019re already together?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Yoongi\nblushed and lifted his hoodie so that it would cover his lower face up to his\nnose \u201cWhat the fuck Joon, now I sound dumb and delusional\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cYou sound\ndumb? I didn\u2019t even know we were in a relationship!\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">It had been\nmonths of levitating in that weird situation of unofficial dates and countless\nmovie nights and infinite texts and secret looks and hidden smiles</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cDude, I\nthought we were just taking it slow, what did you expect me to think when you\ntext me at three in the morning telling me you think about me and then you hold\nmy hand and cook for me?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Namjoon\nshrugged \u201cThat I\u2019m a good friend?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Yoongi\nthrew his hands in the air \u201cMy boyfriend friend zoned himself for me, what the\nfuck is this\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cWait, am I\nyour boyfriend?!\u201d Namjoon shouted</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cWell, good\nquestion, I don\u2019t even know anymore!\u201d he shouted back</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cSo what do\nwe do?\u201d he asked as his cheeks were almost as red as Yoongi\u2019s</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cI don\u2019t\nknow dude, do you want to be my boyfriend?\u201d </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cHell yeah,\nI do!\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cGreat!\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cCool!\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Yoongi\u2019s\nphone started ringing and he quickly picked it up. Namjoon could feel his\nstomach tighten when he saw the exact moment Yoongi\u2019s smile faded away, and his\neyes lost their sparkle and became sad and scared. He brought his legs close to\nhim as if to make himself smaller and he bit his lower lip</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cOkay,\u201d he\nsaid in a quiet tone, almost a whisper \u201cYes, I\u2019m sorry\u201d He shoved his phone\ninto his pocket and stood up \u201cI have to go\u201d </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cIs\neverything okay? You seem-\u201c</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cI\u2019m fine,\neverything\u2019s fine\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He was gone\nbefore Namjoon could even say anything. Yeji, Hoseok, and Jin came back shortly\nafter, holding a bunch of plastic bags full of groceries. They began to put\neverything in the fridge when she noticed that a certain someone was missing </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cIs Yoon\nsleeping already?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cNo, I\nthink he went home,\u201d he said as he was putting a jar of sauce on the shelf</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">She stopped\nmoving and looked at him almost in terror \u201cDid someone call him?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He stopped\ntoo, not sure about why she was so worried suddenly \u201cYeah, he seemed upset\nafter the call and he said he had to leave\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cShit\u201d she\nleft the bag on the kitchen table \u201cFucking shit, how long ago did he leave?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cI don\u2019t\nknow, an hour maybe? Why, what\u2019s going on?\u201d he had never seen her like this,\ncursing and looking like she was about to kill someone as she grabbed her\njacket</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cI\u2019m\ndriving you home, come on\u201d she walked to the living room \u201cHoseok, Jin, you too\nguys, everyone go home\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cWhat\u2019s\nhappening?\u201d Namjoon asked as he followed her \u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">All four of\nthem got out of the house, Hoseok and Jin still out of place, not knowing what\ncould have possibly happened to make Yeji look like that when they always knew\nher as calm and collected</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cNo honey,\nyou did nothing wrong, but you guys really don\u2019t want to be here when I get\nback and-\u201c</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cNo!\u201d\nNamjoon yelled \u201cTell me what\u2019s going on\u201d everyone stopped \u201cI saw that he was\nscared and sad, but I didn\u2019t do anything because I didn\u2019t know what was\nhappening. So tell me what we are worrying so much about\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">She stared\nat him, and her eyes were suddenly filled with the same emotions as Yoongi\u2019s\nwere before he left \u201cTelling you that, is not my decision to make\u201d she said\nsoftly \u201cThe only thing you need to know, is that the more I stay here, the\nworse it gets. So please, <i>please </i>Namjoon,\nget in the car\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He clenched\nhis jaw and got into the car, slamming the door. Hoseok and Jin lived closer\nthan Namjoon, so they would go home by themselves since the sun was still up. Yeji\nstarted driving and the car was soon enough filled with silence and intense\nstaring</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cIt\u2019s my-\u201c</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cIt\u2019s not\nyour fault Joonie,\u201d she said before he could finish his sentence \u201cHe\u2019ll have to\ntalk about this at some point, but I can\u2019t make him do it before he wants to,\nand I sure as hell can\u2019t give him away like that\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cIs he in\ndanger?\u201d </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">She looked\nat him and exhaled as calmly as she could \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">***</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Namjoon had\nthe biggest bags under his eyes that morning. He didn\u2019t get any sleep, nor\nstudied. Yoongi wasn\u2019t answering his phone or his messages, and he was so\nworried that he almost started crying when he showed up at school, two hours\nlate and even paler than usual. He ran towards him and hugged him tightly. He\nfelt his hands touching softly his back, before pushing him away. He stepped\nback</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cNamjoon!\u201d\nhe sounded tired \u201cWe can\u2019t do this at school, people are going to talk\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He felt the\nanger burning in the pit of his stomach \u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d he raised\nhis voice \u201cYou leave as if someone died!\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cPlease\nstop yelling\u201d he whispered but Namjoon spoke almost over him</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cThen Yeji\nacts like someone is going to kill you!\u201d he kept going</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cNamjoon\nplease-\u201c</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cYou don\u2019t\npick up your phone!\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cNam-\u201c</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cYou don\u2019t\nanswer my messages!\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cPlease,\nI-\u201c</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cAnd you\nworry about what people will say? Really? That\u2019s so fucking-\u201c</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cFor fuck\u2019s\nsake Namjoon, please stop!\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He yelled\nback, loudly enough to make half of the kids in the hall look at them. Namjoon\nremained silent, as he saw Yoongi\u2019s eyes full of tears and his hands clenched\nin fists at his sides. His nose and cheeks were red. <i>Was he already crying before getting there? </i>He sighed and walked\npast him, followed by a very concerned Hoseok who whispered something between\nthe lines of <i>you really don\u2019t know when\nto stop, do you?</i> Jin approached him and patted his shoulder</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cDid I fuck\nup?\u201d he asked as he tried to spot his boyfriend leaving</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cWould it\nbe you if you hadn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">***</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Hoseok sat\nnext to Namjoon when the bell rang. Yoongi was already in his seat, a few desks\nbehind them, hood covering half of his face, his look glued to the ground, his\nbackpack still untouched </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cIs he\nokay?\u201d Namjoon whispered to his friend</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cI don\u2019t\nknow man; something really fucked up is going on with him\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He coughed\n\u201cWhat the fuck do you mean?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Hoseok\ncaught his angry tone immediately \u201cChill yo tits, Romeo, I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s\ndoing something wrong, but you seriously have to talk to him\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cI don\u2019t\nthink he even wants to talk to me\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cAre you\nkidding me?\u201d he had to lower his voice before continuing \u201cHe\u2019s dying to talk to\nyou, but he\u2019s scared. You haven\u2019t ever raised your voice like that, and\napparently, he\u2019s pretty sensitive to that stuff\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cWait&hellip;\nDid I scare him?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Hoseok hit\nhis forehead \u201cBitch, you didn\u2019t scare him, you fucking terrified him. You\nalmost scared<i> me</i>; you have no idea\nhow you looked like when you yelled at him in the hallway. I was like, ready to\njump out and drag him away, you looked furious\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Namjoon\nlooked behind them, only to find Yoongi in the exact same position. He hadn\u2019t\nmoved an inch \u201cFine, I\u2019ll talk to him when we\u2019re over\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cYou better\nbe calm as fuck or I\u2019ll seriously beat you up\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cYou\u2019re\nsuddenly surprisingly fond of him, and you sound almost overprotective\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Hoseok\nlooked at him dead serious \u201cYou\u2019ll understand\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">***</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">They were\nstanding on campus, only the two of them, face to face. Yoongi was looking\ndown, while Namjoon didn\u2019t know what to do</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cCan I-\u201c</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry\nI disappeared like that. I\u2019m sorry Yeji made you worry even more. I\u2019m sorry I\ndidn\u2019t answer your messages\u201d he talked like a soldier \u201cI\u2019m sorry I raised my\nvoice at you\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Namjoon\nfroze. He sounded like a robot, like he was programmed to say something like\nthat. He raised his hand to pat his head and he saw him stiffen, shutting his\neyes and clenching his jaw, almost as he expected him to hit him</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cWhat is\nhappening to you, Yoongi?\u201d he whispered</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cNothing\nthat should concern you\u201d </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He turned\naround and tried to leave, but Namjoon held his left wrist. Yoongi literally\nhissed and let out a whimper that made Namjoon almost jump back. He quickly\nloosened his grip and rolled Yoongi\u2019s sleeve up, revealing his bandaged arm,\nfrom his wrist, all the way to his elbow. He gasped softly</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cNothing\nthat should concern me?\u201d he asked, \u201cDid you get into a fight?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Yoongi\nsmiled but his eyes were still filled with sadness \u201cSomething like that\u201d</p><p class=\"fake\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Namjoon\nsighed and kissed his wrist, making the other boy blush. He softly pulled him\ninto a hug, and this time got to hold him for a while. Yoongi let himself get\nimmersed by Namjoon\u2019s body, feeling his scent overflow him. And he felt safe.\nSafer than he\u2019d ever felt before. He smiled to himself secretly. Yeji would\nkill him if she could hear his thoughts\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"2004\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/698027a5191d5be88287b1159587bcdb/tumblr_inline_pfv3w2olvL1uyji0i_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"2004\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"2004\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1f668efe37fbd6e76ba83d514cd0743b/tumblr_inline_pfv3xn5IIl1uyji0i_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"2004\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"/></figure><p>***</p><p>They were\nsitting at a restaurant, both silent, for different reasons. Namjoon sighed and\nlet his fork down</p><p>\u201cWill you\ntell me what is going on?\u201d</p><p>Yoongi was\nwearing a huge hoodie, one that almost reached his knees and with sleeves that\nreached under them. Under the hood, he wore a black hat and a mask that covered\nthe majority of his face. Only his eyes were exposed, but the hat did a pretty\ngood job at covering them too. The room was filled with noise from the other\nclients, but Yoongi didn\u2019t say a word. Nor moved. He just stayed still, as if\nhis life depended on it, as he did too often to not be worrying</p><p>\u201cYoon, I\nunderstand that you don\u2019t want to talk about this, but this is getting out of\nhand. I\u2019m worried about you\u201d</p><p>At those\nwords, Yoongi shook his head, still not talking. He faced the window next to\nthem and Namjoon could see his hands shaking. Whatever he was caught up in, it\nwas getting worse from the day that Yeji had left for her studies abroad. He\nwas collapsing right in front of him, and he wouldn\u2019t let him help him</p><p>\u201cYoongi\u201d he\ncaptured his attention again \u201cI can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t let you hurt yourself\nlike this. Ever since Yeji left, you\u2019re always hiding, you miss school days,\nyou cover yourself up as if that will make you invisible, and I really don\u2019t\nknow what to do. I can\u2019t help you if you don\u2019t let me. Just talk to me\u201d</p><p>Silence\nonce more. A few moments later, Yoongi took a napkin, being extra careful as to\nnot let his hands show from under the thick fabric of the hoodie. He scribbled\nsomething and got up, leaving the restaurant without a single word. Namjoon\nrubbed his forehead before reading what was written on the napkin. \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019.\nHe stared at it for a bit, not knowing what to feel, or what that meant. He\nleft some money on the table and ran out, searching for his boyfriend in the\ntiny crowd. It wasn\u2019t hard to spot him; he always stood out to him. He was\nquick to follow him, but when he had the chance to reach him, a little bell\nrang in his head. And so, Kim Namjoon became the creepy guy who follows his\nboyfriend to see what the fuck is going on in that boy\u2019s life. </p><p>They kept\nwalking, Namjoon keeping a safe distance between them, not that the other boy\nwould even turn around to make sure he wasn\u2019t following him, who does that?\nNamjoon, apparently. A few minutes later, he stopped in front of a house. He\nstood at the door for at least five minutes before going in. Was that his\nhouse? It seemed well taken care of from the outside. Namjoon took a deep\nbreath and walked to the entrance, determined to make that boy talk to him,\neven though he shouldn\u2019t pressure him as Yeji had explicitly clarified before\nleaving. He couldn\u2019t just let him destroy himself like that. He was about to\nknock on the door, when he heard a deep, raspy voice coming from inside. He\ncouldn\u2019t quite understand what he was saying, so he approached the window.\nCreepiness out of the roof at this point</p><p>\u201cWhere did\nyou go,\u201d the unknown man said</p><p>\u201cNowhere\u201d\nYoongi\u2019s voice was weird, almost as if he had a terrible cold</p><p>\u201cDid anyone\nsee you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no one\nsaw me\u201d he repeated</p><p>Namjoon\nheard something creaking, probably the man standing up from an old chair \u201cAre\nyou making fun of me, brat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no sir\u201d\nYoongi\u2019s voice cracked and his phone had the worse timing</p><p>The sound\nof an incoming message filled the room</p><p>\u201cThat\nfaggot is texting you again?\u201d he shouted</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call\nhim that!\u201d Yoongi yelled at him at full force, his voice distorted and broken</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nraise your voice at me, you filthy fag!\u201d</p><p>Namjoon had\nheard enough. He busted the door open, just in time to see the huge man ready\nto punch his boyfriend. He felt the world stop and his breath disappearing.\nWithout a second thought, he ran as fast as he could, falling on the man,\nmaking him lose balance and fall on his side. He started groaning, and Namjoon\ncould easily grasp the situation. He was completely drunk, he probably didn\u2019t\neven see him coming and now he was half unconscious. Yoongi was pressed against\nthe wall, looking at him in absolute terror. Namjoon didn\u2019t even think twice\nbefore grabbing his hand and pulling him out of the house. He lifted him up\neasily and Yoongi wrapped his legs around his waist and arms around his\nshoulders as he rested his face on the crook of his neck</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s\nokay baby,\u201d Namjoon said as he kept running, feeling Yoongi\u2019s tears on his\nskin, thanking his decision to not drop the gym \u201cI got you now\u201d</p><p>He kept\nrunning, even when his legs hurt, even when his lungs were threatening to give\nup on him, even when his whole body became numb to everything except for\nYoongi\u2019s shaking body and tight grip. He finally reached Yeji\u2019s place, which\nwas their shelter. All of the boys basically lived there, mostly because Yeji\nloved that house and they didn\u2019t want her to give it up just because she\u2019d been\ngone for a while. And because they had three kids to take care of, something\nthey couldn\u2019t do at their houses. He rushed in and placed his boyfriend gently\non the couch. Yoongi hesitantly let go of him and brought his legs close to his\nchest like he did every time he felt vulnerable and unsafe and hurt. Namjoon\nfell to his knees in front of him, gasping for air. He felt Yoongi\u2019s hands on\nhis shoulders</p><p>\u201cAre you\nokay?\u201d he asked softly</p><p>It had to\nbe incredibly painful for him to talk and Namjoon cursed at himself for not\nunderstanding, for believing that Yoongi was getting caught in random fights.\nWho? Yoongi. How fucking stupid. Once he got a hold of his breathing again, he\nlooked up at him. He could only see his eyes. He reached for his hood, but\nYoongi held him</p><p>\u201cYoongi\u201d he\nwhispered \u201cRemember that time when I was riding Jin\u2019s bicycle? Remember when I\nwas going too fast to come here faster and fell right outside the house? I fell\nflat on my face and was bleeding like crazy. Yeji was worried that I\u2019d need\nstitches after that. Remember that I didn\u2019t want you to see me like that?\u201d\nYoongi nodded silently \u201cRemember what you said to me?\u201d it was almost two years\nago, but that memory was crystal clear in his mind</p><p>Yoongi\ndidn\u2019t answer for a while \u201cI said that I\u2019d love you no matter what scars you\ncarry on you\u201d</p><p>Namjoon\nsmiled \u201cAnd now I understand how important that sentence was and still is to\nyou. So, Yoongi. Will you let me love you with all your scars?\u201d</p><p>Yoongi kept\nholding his boyfriend\u2019s hand for a bit longer, before letting go of him.\nNamjoon was careful in his next moves. He touched him lightly as if to not\nbreak him. He took off his hood, and then his hat. His bangs fell over his\nface, still hiding whatever Yoongi wanted to keep a secret so badly. He ran his\nfingers through his hair softly and reached behind his ears to remove his black\nmask. He took it off slowly, to reveal Yoongi\u2019s face, making him tear up\ninstantly. He hadn\u2019t ever seen any human being so beat up in his whole life.\nHis right cheekbone was swollen and almost black, his nose wasn\u2019t broken by a\nmiracle, his entire lower jaw was awfully bruised, his lips were full of tiny\ncuts and they had dried blood all over them. His neck had the shape of big\nhands around it, and he was pretty sure that it would continue even under the\nhoodie. He rolled up his sleeves to reveal more bruises and cuts from what he\nsupposed were shards of glasses. He placed his forehead on Yoongi\u2019s knees and\ntried, <i>really tried</i> not to cry,\nbecause fucking hell he couldn\u2019t let Yoongi see him cry because of this. But\nhow could he not? How could he not cry his heart out on his boyfriend\u2019s hands\nwhen he had let him go through that alone? How could he keep his calm fa\u00e7ade\nwhen he was faced with so much pain in the eyes of the one he loved so much?\nHow could he not cry out apologies when he couldn\u2019t be there for him after he\nhad promised that he\u2019d always protect him? He was trying to calm himself down\nwhen he felt Yoongi wrapping his arms around him as softly as he could, and\npulling him in the most fragile hug he had ever felt</p><p>\u201cI love\nyou, Namjoon\u201d he whispered. He felt him holding him carefully \u201cWith all of our scars\u201d\nhe continues \u201cWith all of our faults\u201d</p><p>Namjoon\nsmiled \u201cI love you too\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis seems\nlike the proper timing for a kiss, but I doubt either of us would enjoy that\u201d</p><p>They\ngiggled exhausted, and that night, under the faint light of the full moon,\nalone in that familiar living room, they made a silent promise to love each\nother, even when it hurt to do so</p>",

Yeji\n\u2013said best friend- was preparing food for the three little demons she had to\ntake care of. Babysitting Jungkook, Jimin, and Taehyung was her job in her free\ntime since the parents of all three of the tiny humans worked together and were\naway most of the time. She had raised those kids since they were born, and now\nJimin (or Chimmy) and Taehyung (Tata for a very specific group of friends) were\nseven years old and Kookie was five. She adored them, and Namjoon with the rest\nof the group loved them too, but they were too proud to ever admit that. Except\nfor Hoseok. He had no pride in the matter.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">An hour or\nso later, and after the three balls of energy were asleep, Yeji sat on the\ncarpet next to Namjoon and watched him as he played his game passionately. He\nhad his excessively long brown hair on a ponytail to keep them from falling\nover his eyes, something that the rest of the group found hilarious. The door\nunlocked and Yoongi walked in, looking like a zombie. Namjoon felt his cheeks\nburning and the other boy stopped for a moment</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cHey\u201d he\nmumbled and had to contain his smile at the sight of the boy\u2019s hair \u201cDidn\u2019t\nknow you\u2019d be here\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Namjoon\nkept playing even though his mind was somewhere else entirely \u201cYeah, Yeji\nneeded some help with the little ones\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">She smiled\nevilly and then looked over at Yoongi \u201cGo leave your stuff and wash your hands,\nfood is ready in a bit\u201d as soon as he left the room, she faced Namjoon \u201cPlease\nconfess already\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cWhat?!\u201d he\nexclaimed \u201cNo way!\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cWhy not?\u201d\nshe smirked and tilted her head playfully</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cBecause\nI\u2019m awkward and he\u2019s being just a bit more comfortable around me and I don\u2019t\nwanna screw that up\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cYou do\nrealize that he\u2019s more comfortable because you\u2019ve shown signs that you like\nhim, right?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cYou can\u2019t\nbe so sure\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cHoney,\nI\u2019ve known him since he was born. Literally. We\u2019re living together for the last\nfifteen years. I know him better than he knows himself right now. I might be\nten years older than you guys but I\u2019m not old enough to be completely blind.\nAnd he spends most of the day here so he talks to me. Like, a lot\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">That seemed\nto capture the boy\u2019s attention \u201cDid he say anything about me?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">She laughed\n\u201cYou\u2019re crazy if you think that I\u2019d betray my little bro like that\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He pouted\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you told him everything I\u2019ve ever said to you\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">She gasped\ndramatically \u201cHow dare you question my loyalty? I haven\u2019t said a word!\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">They both\nlaughed and Yoongi sat next to Namjoon with a long sigh after a few moments\n\u201cWhat are we laughing about?\u201d he asked tiredly</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cNamjoon\ncompletely failing at this game\u201d Yeji smiled and got up \u201cIs anyone else\ncoming?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Yoongi\nlooked up from his phone \u201cUh, I think Hobi is\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Yeji rolled\nher eyes \u201cOf course he is\u201d </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cOh, and I\nthink Jin is coming too\u201d added Namjoon without taking his eyes from the screen</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">She stared\nat them \u201cI love it when you invite yourselves over\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">They both\nsmiled with puppy eyes that made her melt and drop her tough fa\u00e7ade. She cursed\nfondly under her breath as she dragged them both into the kitchen to help her\nout preparing food for four very hungry teenagers. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">***</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cSo, uh, in\nshort, well, what I called you here for, uh-\u201c</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cAre you\nbreaking up with me?\u201d Yoongi cut him off</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">They were\nsitting at the small table at Yeji\u2019s place, keeping an eye on the little ones\neven though they were still sleeping. The others had to go shopping, so they\nshouldn\u2019t be back for at least another hour. Yoongi was wearing an oversized\npink hoodie that he had stolen from Yeji, and Namjoon felt his soul leave his\nbody when he saw him in it. He looked like a fluffy marshmallow with his cute\nblack bed hair and pouty lips. One thing he absolutely loved about him was the\nway his lips pouted every time he talked, or how his eyes lit up when he asked\nsomething and the answer would surprise him even in the slightest. What he\ndidn\u2019t know, was that Yoongi absolutely adored his dimples. And his big ass\neyes that gave him the feeling that they actually held stars in them, even\nthough that wasn\u2019t even possible. And he loved how clumsy he could get,\nespecially when he got nervous about anything, or how his voice was raspy and\ndeep in the morning, and how soft he sounded when humming his favorite songs,\nor how ridiculously good he looked in his big ass glasses</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Namjoon\nlooked at him completely lost \u201cWait, we\u2019re already together?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Yoongi\nblushed and lifted his hoodie so that it would cover his lower face up to his\nnose \u201cWhat the fuck Joon, now I sound dumb and delusional\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cYou sound\ndumb? I didn\u2019t even know we were in a relationship!\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">It had been\nmonths of levitating in that weird situation of unofficial dates and countless\nmovie nights and infinite texts and secret looks and hidden smiles</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cDude, I\nthought we were just taking it slow, what did you expect me to think when you\ntext me at three in the morning telling me you think about me and then you hold\nmy hand and cook for me?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Namjoon\nshrugged \u201cThat I\u2019m a good friend?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Yoongi\nthrew his hands in the air \u201cMy boyfriend friend zoned himself for me, what the\nfuck is this\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cWait, am I\nyour boyfriend?!\u201d Namjoon shouted</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cWell, good\nquestion, I don\u2019t even know anymore!\u201d he shouted back</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cSo what do\nwe do?\u201d he asked as his cheeks were almost as red as Yoongi\u2019s</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cI don\u2019t\nknow dude, do you want to be my boyfriend?\u201d </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cHell yeah,\nI do!\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cGreat!\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cCool!\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Yoongi\u2019s\nphone started ringing and he quickly picked it up. Namjoon could feel his\nstomach tighten when he saw the exact moment Yoongi\u2019s smile faded away, and his\neyes lost their sparkle and became sad and scared. He brought his legs close to\nhim as if to make himself smaller and he bit his lower lip</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cOkay,\u201d he\nsaid in a quiet tone, almost a whisper \u201cYes, I\u2019m sorry\u201d He shoved his phone\ninto his pocket and stood up \u201cI have to go\u201d </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cIs\neverything okay? You seem-\u201c</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cI\u2019m fine,\neverything\u2019s fine\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He was gone\nbefore Namjoon could even say anything. Yeji, Hoseok, and Jin came back shortly\nafter, holding a bunch of plastic bags full of groceries. They began to put\neverything in the fridge when she noticed that a certain someone was missing </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cIs Yoon\nsleeping already?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cNo, I\nthink he went home,\u201d he said as he was putting a jar of sauce on the shelf</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">She stopped\nmoving and looked at him almost in terror \u201cDid someone call him?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He stopped\ntoo, not sure about why she was so worried suddenly \u201cYeah, he seemed upset\nafter the call and he said he had to leave\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cShit\u201d she\nleft the bag on the kitchen table \u201cFucking shit, how long ago did he leave?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cI don\u2019t\nknow, an hour maybe? Why, what\u2019s going on?\u201d he had never seen her like this,\ncursing and looking like she was about to kill someone as she grabbed her\njacket</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cI\u2019m\ndriving you home, come on\u201d she walked to the living room \u201cHoseok, Jin, you too\nguys, everyone go home\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cWhat\u2019s\nhappening?\u201d Namjoon asked as he followed her \u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">All four of\nthem got out of the house, Hoseok and Jin still out of place, not knowing what\ncould have possibly happened to make Yeji look like that when they always knew\nher as calm and collected</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cNo honey,\nyou did nothing wrong, but you guys really don\u2019t want to be here when I get\nback and-\u201c</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cNo!\u201d\nNamjoon yelled \u201cTell me what\u2019s going on\u201d everyone stopped \u201cI saw that he was\nscared and sad, but I didn\u2019t do anything because I didn\u2019t know what was\nhappening. So tell me what we are worrying so much about\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">She stared\nat him, and her eyes were suddenly filled with the same emotions as Yoongi\u2019s\nwere before he left \u201cTelling you that, is not my decision to make\u201d she said\nsoftly \u201cThe only thing you need to know, is that the more I stay here, the\nworse it gets. So please, <i>please </i>Namjoon,\nget in the car\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He clenched\nhis jaw and got into the car, slamming the door. Hoseok and Jin lived closer\nthan Namjoon, so they would go home by themselves since the sun was still up. Yeji\nstarted driving and the car was soon enough filled with silence and intense\nstaring</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cIt\u2019s my-\u201c</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cIt\u2019s not\nyour fault Joonie,\u201d she said before he could finish his sentence \u201cHe\u2019ll have to\ntalk about this at some point, but I can\u2019t make him do it before he wants to,\nand I sure as hell can\u2019t give him away like that\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cIs he in\ndanger?\u201d </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">She looked\nat him and exhaled as calmly as she could \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">***</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Namjoon had\nthe biggest bags under his eyes that morning. He didn\u2019t get any sleep, nor\nstudied. Yoongi wasn\u2019t answering his phone or his messages, and he was so\nworried that he almost started crying when he showed up at school, two hours\nlate and even paler than usual. He ran towards him and hugged him tightly. He\nfelt his hands touching softly his back, before pushing him away. He stepped\nback</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cNamjoon!\u201d\nhe sounded tired \u201cWe can\u2019t do this at school, people are going to talk\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He felt the\nanger burning in the pit of his stomach \u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d he raised\nhis voice \u201cYou leave as if someone died!\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cPlease\nstop yelling\u201d he whispered but Namjoon spoke almost over him</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cThen Yeji\nacts like someone is going to kill you!\u201d he kept going</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cNamjoon\nplease-\u201c</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cYou don\u2019t\npick up your phone!\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cNam-\u201c</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cYou don\u2019t\nanswer my messages!\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cPlease,\nI-\u201c</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cAnd you\nworry about what people will say? Really? That\u2019s so fucking-\u201c</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cFor fuck\u2019s\nsake Namjoon, please stop!\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He yelled\nback, loudly enough to make half of the kids in the hall look at them. Namjoon\nremained silent, as he saw Yoongi\u2019s eyes full of tears and his hands clenched\nin fists at his sides. His nose and cheeks were red. <i>Was he already crying before getting there? </i>He sighed and walked\npast him, followed by a very concerned Hoseok who whispered something between\nthe lines of <i>you really don\u2019t know when\nto stop, do you?</i> Jin approached him and patted his shoulder</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cDid I fuck\nup?\u201d he asked as he tried to spot his boyfriend leaving</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cWould it\nbe you if you hadn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">***</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Hoseok sat\nnext to Namjoon when the bell rang. Yoongi was already in his seat, a few desks\nbehind them, hood covering half of his face, his look glued to the ground, his\nbackpack still untouched </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cIs he\nokay?\u201d Namjoon whispered to his friend</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cI don\u2019t\nknow man; something really fucked up is going on with him\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He coughed\n\u201cWhat the fuck do you mean?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Hoseok\ncaught his angry tone immediately \u201cChill yo tits, Romeo, I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s\ndoing something wrong, but you seriously have to talk to him\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cI don\u2019t\nthink he even wants to talk to me\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cAre you\nkidding me?\u201d he had to lower his voice before continuing \u201cHe\u2019s dying to talk to\nyou, but he\u2019s scared. You haven\u2019t ever raised your voice like that, and\napparently, he\u2019s pretty sensitive to that stuff\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cWait\u2026\nDid I scare him?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Hoseok hit\nhis forehead \u201cBitch, you didn\u2019t scare him, you fucking terrified him. You\nalmost scared<i> me</i>; you have no idea\nhow you looked like when you yelled at him in the hallway. I was like, ready to\njump out and drag him away, you looked furious\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Namjoon\nlooked behind them, only to find Yoongi in the exact same position. He hadn\u2019t\nmoved an inch \u201cFine, I\u2019ll talk to him when we\u2019re over\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cYou better\nbe calm as fuck or I\u2019ll seriously beat you up\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cYou\u2019re\nsuddenly surprisingly fond of him, and you sound almost overprotective\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Hoseok\nlooked at him dead serious \u201cYou\u2019ll understand\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">***</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">They were\nstanding on campus, only the two of them, face to face. Yoongi was looking\ndown, while Namjoon didn\u2019t know what to do</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cCan I-\u201c</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry\nI disappeared like that. I\u2019m sorry Yeji made you worry even more. I\u2019m sorry I\ndidn\u2019t answer your messages\u201d he talked like a soldier \u201cI\u2019m sorry I raised my\nvoice at you\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Namjoon\nfroze. He sounded like a robot, like he was programmed to say something like\nthat. He raised his hand to pat his head and he saw him stiffen, shutting his\neyes and clenching his jaw, almost as he expected him to hit him</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cWhat is\nhappening to you, Yoongi?\u201d he whispered</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cNothing\nthat should concern you\u201d </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He turned\naround and tried to leave, but Namjoon held his left wrist. Yoongi literally\nhissed and let out a whimper that made Namjoon almost jump back. He quickly\nloosened his grip and rolled Yoongi\u2019s sleeve up, revealing his bandaged arm,\nfrom his wrist, all the way to his elbow. He gasped softly</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cNothing\nthat should concern me?\u201d he asked, \u201cDid you get into a fight?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Yoongi\nsmiled but his eyes were still filled with sadness \u201cSomething like that\u201d</p><p class=\"fake\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Namjoon\nsighed and kissed his wrist, making the other boy blush. He softly pulled him\ninto a hug, and this time got to hold him for a while. Yoongi let himself get\nimmersed by Namjoon\u2019s body, feeling his scent overflow him. And he felt safe.\nSafer than he\u2019d ever felt before. He smiled to himself secretly. Yeji would\nkill him if she could hear his thoughts\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"2004\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/698027a5191d5be88287b1159587bcdb/tumblr_inline_pfv3w2olvL1uyji0i_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"2004\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"2004\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1f668efe37fbd6e76ba83d514cd0743b/tumblr_inline_pfv3xn5IIl1uyji0i_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"2004\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"></figure><p>***</p><p>They were\nsitting at a restaurant, both silent, for different reasons. Namjoon sighed and\nlet his fork down</p><p>\u201cWill you\ntell me what is going on?\u201d</p><p>Yoongi was\nwearing a huge hoodie, one that almost reached his knees and with sleeves that\nreached under them. Under the hood, he wore a black hat and a mask that covered\nthe majority of his face. Only his eyes were exposed, but the hat did a pretty\ngood job at covering them too. The room was filled with noise from the other\nclients, but Yoongi didn\u2019t say a word. Nor moved. He just stayed still, as if\nhis life depended on it, as he did too often to not be worrying</p><p>\u201cYoon, I\nunderstand that you don\u2019t want to talk about this, but this is getting out of\nhand. I\u2019m worried about you\u201d</p><p>At those\nwords, Yoongi shook his head, still not talking. He faced the window next to\nthem and Namjoon could see his hands shaking. Whatever he was caught up in, it\nwas getting worse from the day that Yeji had left for her studies abroad. He\nwas collapsing right in front of him, and he wouldn\u2019t let him help him</p><p>\u201cYoongi\u201d he\ncaptured his attention again \u201cI can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t let you hurt yourself\nlike this. Ever since Yeji left, you\u2019re always hiding, you miss school days,\nyou cover yourself up as if that will make you invisible, and I really don\u2019t\nknow what to do. I can\u2019t help you if you don\u2019t let me. Just talk to me\u201d</p><p>Silence\nonce more. A few moments later, Yoongi took a napkin, being extra careful as to\nnot let his hands show from under the thick fabric of the hoodie. He scribbled\nsomething and got up, leaving the restaurant without a single word. Namjoon\nrubbed his forehead before reading what was written on the napkin. \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019.\nHe stared at it for a bit, not knowing what to feel, or what that meant. He\nleft some money on the table and ran out, searching for his boyfriend in the\ntiny crowd. It wasn\u2019t hard to spot him; he always stood out to him. He was\nquick to follow him, but when he had the chance to reach him, a little bell\nrang in his head. And so, Kim Namjoon became the creepy guy who follows his\nboyfriend to see what the fuck is going on in that boy\u2019s life. </p><p>They kept\nwalking, Namjoon keeping a safe distance between them, not that the other boy\nwould even turn around to make sure he wasn\u2019t following him, who does that?\nNamjoon, apparently. A few minutes later, he stopped in front of a house. He\nstood at the door for at least five minutes before going in. Was that his\nhouse? It seemed well taken care of from the outside. Namjoon took a deep\nbreath and walked to the entrance, determined to make that boy talk to him,\neven though he shouldn\u2019t pressure him as Yeji had explicitly clarified before\nleaving. He couldn\u2019t just let him destroy himself like that. He was about to\nknock on the door, when he heard a deep, raspy voice coming from inside. He\ncouldn\u2019t quite understand what he was saying, so he approached the window.\nCreepiness out of the roof at this point</p><p>\u201cWhere did\nyou go,\u201d the unknown man said</p><p>\u201cNowhere\u201d\nYoongi\u2019s voice was weird, almost as if he had a terrible cold</p><p>\u201cDid anyone\nsee you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no one\nsaw me\u201d he repeated</p><p>Namjoon\nheard something creaking, probably the man standing up from an old chair \u201cAre\nyou making fun of me, brat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no sir\u201d\nYoongi\u2019s voice cracked and his phone had the worse timing</p><p>The sound\nof an incoming message filled the room</p><p>\u201cThat\nfaggot is texting you again?\u201d he shouted</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call\nhim that!\u201d Yoongi yelled at him at full force, his voice distorted and broken</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nraise your voice at me, you filthy fag!\u201d</p><p>Namjoon had\nheard enough. He busted the door open, just in time to see the huge man ready\nto punch his boyfriend. He felt the world stop and his breath disappearing.\nWithout a second thought, he ran as fast as he could, falling on the man,\nmaking him lose balance and fall on his side. He started groaning, and Namjoon\ncould easily grasp the situation. He was completely drunk, he probably didn\u2019t\neven see him coming and now he was half unconscious. Yoongi was pressed against\nthe wall, looking at him in absolute terror. Namjoon didn\u2019t even think twice\nbefore grabbing his hand and pulling him out of the house. He lifted him up\neasily and Yoongi wrapped his legs around his waist and arms around his\nshoulders as he rested his face on the crook of his neck</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s\nokay baby,\u201d Namjoon said as he kept running, feeling Yoongi\u2019s tears on his\nskin, thanking his decision to not drop the gym \u201cI got you now\u201d</p><p>He kept\nrunning, even when his legs hurt, even when his lungs were threatening to give\nup on him, even when his whole body became numb to everything except for\nYoongi\u2019s shaking body and tight grip. He finally reached Yeji\u2019s place, which\nwas their shelter. All of the boys basically lived there, mostly because Yeji\nloved that house and they didn\u2019t want her to give it up just because she\u2019d been\ngone for a while. And because they had three kids to take care of, something\nthey couldn\u2019t do at their houses. He rushed in and placed his boyfriend gently\non the couch. Yoongi hesitantly let go of him and brought his legs close to his\nchest like he did every time he felt vulnerable and unsafe and hurt. Namjoon\nfell to his knees in front of him, gasping for air. He felt Yoongi\u2019s hands on\nhis shoulders</p><p>\u201cAre you\nokay?\u201d he asked softly</p><p>It had to\nbe incredibly painful for him to talk and Namjoon cursed at himself for not\nunderstanding, for believing that Yoongi was getting caught in random fights.\nWho? Yoongi. How fucking stupid. Once he got a hold of his breathing again, he\nlooked up at him. He could only see his eyes. He reached for his hood, but\nYoongi held him</p><p>\u201cYoongi\u201d he\nwhispered \u201cRemember that time when I was riding Jin\u2019s bicycle? Remember when I\nwas going too fast to come here faster and fell right outside the house? I fell\nflat on my face and was bleeding like crazy. Yeji was worried that I\u2019d need\nstitches after that. Remember that I didn\u2019t want you to see me like that?\u201d\nYoongi nodded silently \u201cRemember what you said to me?\u201d it was almost two years\nago, but that memory was crystal clear in his mind</p><p>Yoongi\ndidn\u2019t answer for a while \u201cI said that I\u2019d love you no matter what scars you\ncarry on you\u201d</p><p>Namjoon\nsmiled \u201cAnd now I understand how important that sentence was and still is to\nyou. So, Yoongi. Will you let me love you with all your scars?\u201d</p><p>Yoongi kept\nholding his boyfriend\u2019s hand for a bit longer, before letting go of him.\nNamjoon was careful in his next moves. He touched him lightly as if to not\nbreak him. He took off his hood, and then his hat. His bangs fell over his\nface, still hiding whatever Yoongi wanted to keep a secret so badly. He ran his\nfingers through his hair softly and reached behind his ears to remove his black\nmask. He took it off slowly, to reveal Yoongi\u2019s face, making him tear up\ninstantly. He hadn\u2019t ever seen any human being so beat up in his whole life.\nHis right cheekbone was swollen and almost black, his nose wasn\u2019t broken by a\nmiracle, his entire lower jaw was awfully bruised, his lips were full of tiny\ncuts and they had dried blood all over them. His neck had the shape of big\nhands around it, and he was pretty sure that it would continue even under the\nhoodie. He rolled up his sleeves to reveal more bruises and cuts from what he\nsupposed were shards of glasses. He placed his forehead on Yoongi\u2019s knees and\ntried, <i>really tried</i> not to cry,\nbecause fucking hell he couldn\u2019t let Yoongi see him cry because of this. But\nhow could he not? How could he not cry his heart out on his boyfriend\u2019s hands\nwhen he had let him go through that alone? How could he keep his calm fa\u00e7ade\nwhen he was faced with so much pain in the eyes of the one he loved so much?\nHow could he not cry out apologies when he couldn\u2019t be there for him after he\nhad promised that he\u2019d always protect him? He was trying to calm himself down\nwhen he felt Yoongi wrapping his arms around him as softly as he could, and\npulling him in the most fragile hug he had ever felt</p><p>\u201cI love\nyou, Namjoon\u201d he whispered. He felt him holding him carefully \u201cWith all of our scars\u201d\nhe continues \u201cWith all of our faults\u201d</p><p>Namjoon\nsmiled \u201cI love you too\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis seems\nlike the proper timing for a kiss, but I doubt either of us would enjoy that\u201d</p><p>They\ngiggled exhausted, and that night, under the faint light of the full moon,\nalone in that familiar living room, they made a silent promise to love each\nother, even when it hurt to do so</p></p>",

Yeji\n\u2013said best friend- was preparing food for the three little demons she had to\ntake care of. Babysitting Jungkook, Jimin, and Taehyung was her job in her free\ntime since the parents of all three of the tiny humans worked together and were\naway most of the time. She had raised those kids since they were born, and now\nJimin (or Chimmy) and Taehyung (Tata for a very specific group of friends) were\nseven years old and Kookie was five. She adored them, and Namjoon with the rest\nof the group loved them too, but they were too proud to ever admit that. Except\nfor Hoseok. He had no pride in the matter.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">An hour or\nso later, and after the three balls of energy were asleep, Yeji sat on the\ncarpet next to Namjoon and watched him as he played his game passionately. He\nhad his excessively long brown hair on a ponytail to keep them from falling\nover his eyes, something that the rest of the group found hilarious. The door\nunlocked and Yoongi walked in, looking like a zombie. Namjoon felt his cheeks\nburning and the other boy stopped for a moment</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cHey\u201d he\nmumbled and had to contain his smile at the sight of the boy\u2019s hair \u201cDidn\u2019t\nknow you\u2019d be here\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Namjoon\nkept playing even though his mind was somewhere else entirely \u201cYeah, Yeji\nneeded some help with the little ones\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">She smiled\nevilly and then looked over at Yoongi \u201cGo leave your stuff and wash your hands,\nfood is ready in a bit\u201d as soon as he left the room, she faced Namjoon \u201cPlease\nconfess already\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cWhat?!\u201d he\nexclaimed \u201cNo way!\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cWhy not?\u201d\nshe smirked and tilted her head playfully</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cBecause\nI\u2019m awkward and he\u2019s being just a bit more comfortable around me and I don\u2019t\nwanna screw that up\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cYou do\nrealize that he\u2019s more comfortable because you\u2019ve shown signs that you like\nhim, right?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cYou can\u2019t\nbe so sure\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cHoney,\nI\u2019ve known him since he was born. Literally. We\u2019re living together for the last\nfifteen years. I know him better than he knows himself right now. I might be\nten years older than you guys but I\u2019m not old enough to be completely blind.\nAnd he spends most of the day here so he talks to me. Like, a lot\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">That seemed\nto capture the boy\u2019s attention \u201cDid he say anything about me?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">She laughed\n\u201cYou\u2019re crazy if you think that I\u2019d betray my little bro like that\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He pouted\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you told him everything I\u2019ve ever said to you\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">She gasped\ndramatically \u201cHow dare you question my loyalty? I haven\u2019t said a word!\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">They both\nlaughed and Yoongi sat next to Namjoon with a long sigh after a few moments\n\u201cWhat are we laughing about?\u201d he asked tiredly</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cNamjoon\ncompletely failing at this game\u201d Yeji smiled and got up \u201cIs anyone else\ncoming?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Yoongi\nlooked up from his phone \u201cUh, I think Hobi is\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Yeji rolled\nher eyes \u201cOf course he is\u201d </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cOh, and I\nthink Jin is coming too\u201d added Namjoon without taking his eyes from the screen</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">She stared\nat them \u201cI love it when you invite yourselves over\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">They both\nsmiled with puppy eyes that made her melt and drop her tough fa\u00e7ade. She cursed\nfondly under her breath as she dragged them both into the kitchen to help her\nout preparing food for four very hungry teenagers. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">***</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cSo, uh, in\nshort, well, what I called you here for, uh-\u201c</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cAre you\nbreaking up with me?\u201d Yoongi cut him off</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">They were\nsitting at the small table at Yeji\u2019s place, keeping an eye on the little ones\neven though they were still sleeping. The others had to go shopping, so they\nshouldn\u2019t be back for at least another hour. Yoongi was wearing an oversized\npink hoodie that he had stolen from Yeji, and Namjoon felt his soul leave his\nbody when he saw him in it. He looked like a fluffy marshmallow with his cute\nblack bed hair and pouty lips. One thing he absolutely loved about him was the\nway his lips pouted every time he talked, or how his eyes lit up when he asked\nsomething and the answer would surprise him even in the slightest. What he\ndidn\u2019t know, was that Yoongi absolutely adored his dimples. And his big ass\neyes that gave him the feeling that they actually held stars in them, even\nthough that wasn\u2019t even possible. And he loved how clumsy he could get,\nespecially when he got nervous about anything, or how his voice was raspy and\ndeep in the morning, and how soft he sounded when humming his favorite songs,\nor how ridiculously good he looked in his big ass glasses</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Namjoon\nlooked at him completely lost \u201cWait, we\u2019re already together?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Yoongi\nblushed and lifted his hoodie so that it would cover his lower face up to his\nnose \u201cWhat the fuck Joon, now I sound dumb and delusional\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cYou sound\ndumb? I didn\u2019t even know we were in a relationship!\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">It had been\nmonths of levitating in that weird situation of unofficial dates and countless\nmovie nights and infinite texts and secret looks and hidden smiles</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cDude, I\nthought we were just taking it slow, what did you expect me to think when you\ntext me at three in the morning telling me you think about me and then you hold\nmy hand and cook for me?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Namjoon\nshrugged \u201cThat I\u2019m a good friend?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Yoongi\nthrew his hands in the air \u201cMy boyfriend friend zoned himself for me, what the\nfuck is this\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cWait, am I\nyour boyfriend?!\u201d Namjoon shouted</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cWell, good\nquestion, I don\u2019t even know anymore!\u201d he shouted back</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cSo what do\nwe do?\u201d he asked as his cheeks were almost as red as Yoongi\u2019s</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cI don\u2019t\nknow dude, do you want to be my boyfriend?\u201d </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cHell yeah,\nI do!\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cGreat!\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cCool!\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Yoongi\u2019s\nphone started ringing and he quickly picked it up. Namjoon could feel his\nstomach tighten when he saw the exact moment Yoongi\u2019s smile faded away, and his\neyes lost their sparkle and became sad and scared. He brought his legs close to\nhim as if to make himself smaller and he bit his lower lip</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cOkay,\u201d he\nsaid in a quiet tone, almost a whisper \u201cYes, I\u2019m sorry\u201d He shoved his phone\ninto his pocket and stood up \u201cI have to go\u201d </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cIs\neverything okay? You seem-\u201c</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cI\u2019m fine,\neverything\u2019s fine\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He was gone\nbefore Namjoon could even say anything. Yeji, Hoseok, and Jin came back shortly\nafter, holding a bunch of plastic bags full of groceries. They began to put\neverything in the fridge when she noticed that a certain someone was missing </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cIs Yoon\nsleeping already?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cNo, I\nthink he went home,\u201d he said as he was putting a jar of sauce on the shelf</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">She stopped\nmoving and looked at him almost in terror \u201cDid someone call him?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He stopped\ntoo, not sure about why she was so worried suddenly \u201cYeah, he seemed upset\nafter the call and he said he had to leave\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cShit\u201d she\nleft the bag on the kitchen table \u201cFucking shit, how long ago did he leave?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cI don\u2019t\nknow, an hour maybe? Why, what\u2019s going on?\u201d he had never seen her like this,\ncursing and looking like she was about to kill someone as she grabbed her\njacket</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cI\u2019m\ndriving you home, come on\u201d she walked to the living room \u201cHoseok, Jin, you too\nguys, everyone go home\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cWhat\u2019s\nhappening?\u201d Namjoon asked as he followed her \u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">All four of\nthem got out of the house, Hoseok and Jin still out of place, not knowing what\ncould have possibly happened to make Yeji look like that when they always knew\nher as calm and collected</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cNo honey,\nyou did nothing wrong, but you guys really don\u2019t want to be here when I get\nback and-\u201c</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cNo!\u201d\nNamjoon yelled \u201cTell me what\u2019s going on\u201d everyone stopped \u201cI saw that he was\nscared and sad, but I didn\u2019t do anything because I didn\u2019t know what was\nhappening. So tell me what we are worrying so much about\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">She stared\nat him, and her eyes were suddenly filled with the same emotions as Yoongi\u2019s\nwere before he left \u201cTelling you that, is not my decision to make\u201d she said\nsoftly \u201cThe only thing you need to know, is that the more I stay here, the\nworse it gets. So please, <i>please </i>Namjoon,\nget in the car\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He clenched\nhis jaw and got into the car, slamming the door. Hoseok and Jin lived closer\nthan Namjoon, so they would go home by themselves since the sun was still up. Yeji\nstarted driving and the car was soon enough filled with silence and intense\nstaring</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cIt\u2019s my-\u201c</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cIt\u2019s not\nyour fault Joonie,\u201d she said before he could finish his sentence \u201cHe\u2019ll have to\ntalk about this at some point, but I can\u2019t make him do it before he wants to,\nand I sure as hell can\u2019t give him away like that\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cIs he in\ndanger?\u201d </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">She looked\nat him and exhaled as calmly as she could \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">***</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Namjoon had\nthe biggest bags under his eyes that morning. He didn\u2019t get any sleep, nor\nstudied. Yoongi wasn\u2019t answering his phone or his messages, and he was so\nworried that he almost started crying when he showed up at school, two hours\nlate and even paler than usual. He ran towards him and hugged him tightly. He\nfelt his hands touching softly his back, before pushing him away. He stepped\nback</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cNamjoon!\u201d\nhe sounded tired \u201cWe can\u2019t do this at school, people are going to talk\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He felt the\nanger burning in the pit of his stomach \u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d he raised\nhis voice \u201cYou leave as if someone died!\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cPlease\nstop yelling\u201d he whispered but Namjoon spoke almost over him</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cThen Yeji\nacts like someone is going to kill you!\u201d he kept going</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cNamjoon\nplease-\u201c</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cYou don\u2019t\npick up your phone!\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cNam-\u201c</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cYou don\u2019t\nanswer my messages!\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cPlease,\nI-\u201c</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cAnd you\nworry about what people will say? Really? That\u2019s so fucking-\u201c</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cFor fuck\u2019s\nsake Namjoon, please stop!\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He yelled\nback, loudly enough to make half of the kids in the hall look at them. Namjoon\nremained silent, as he saw Yoongi\u2019s eyes full of tears and his hands clenched\nin fists at his sides. His nose and cheeks were red. <i>Was he already crying before getting there? </i>He sighed and walked\npast him, followed by a very concerned Hoseok who whispered something between\nthe lines of <i>you really don\u2019t know when\nto stop, do you?</i> Jin approached him and patted his shoulder</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cDid I fuck\nup?\u201d he asked as he tried to spot his boyfriend leaving</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cWould it\nbe you if you hadn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">***</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Hoseok sat\nnext to Namjoon when the bell rang. Yoongi was already in his seat, a few desks\nbehind them, hood covering half of his face, his look glued to the ground, his\nbackpack still untouched </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cIs he\nokay?\u201d Namjoon whispered to his friend</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cI don\u2019t\nknow man; something really fucked up is going on with him\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He coughed\n\u201cWhat the fuck do you mean?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Hoseok\ncaught his angry tone immediately \u201cChill yo tits, Romeo, I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s\ndoing something wrong, but you seriously have to talk to him\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cI don\u2019t\nthink he even wants to talk to me\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cAre you\nkidding me?\u201d he had to lower his voice before continuing \u201cHe\u2019s dying to talk to\nyou, but he\u2019s scared. You haven\u2019t ever raised your voice like that, and\napparently, he\u2019s pretty sensitive to that stuff\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cWait\u2026\nDid I scare him?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Hoseok hit\nhis forehead \u201cBitch, you didn\u2019t scare him, you fucking terrified him. You\nalmost scared<i> me</i>; you have no idea\nhow you looked like when you yelled at him in the hallway. I was like, ready to\njump out and drag him away, you looked furious\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Namjoon\nlooked behind them, only to find Yoongi in the exact same position. He hadn\u2019t\nmoved an inch \u201cFine, I\u2019ll talk to him when we\u2019re over\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cYou better\nbe calm as fuck or I\u2019ll seriously beat you up\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cYou\u2019re\nsuddenly surprisingly fond of him, and you sound almost overprotective\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Hoseok\nlooked at him dead serious \u201cYou\u2019ll understand\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">***</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">They were\nstanding on campus, only the two of them, face to face. Yoongi was looking\ndown, while Namjoon didn\u2019t know what to do</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cCan I-\u201c</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry\nI disappeared like that. I\u2019m sorry Yeji made you worry even more. I\u2019m sorry I\ndidn\u2019t answer your messages\u201d he talked like a soldier \u201cI\u2019m sorry I raised my\nvoice at you\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Namjoon\nfroze. He sounded like a robot, like he was programmed to say something like\nthat. He raised his hand to pat his head and he saw him stiffen, shutting his\neyes and clenching his jaw, almost as he expected him to hit him</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cWhat is\nhappening to you, Yoongi?\u201d he whispered</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cNothing\nthat should concern you\u201d </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">He turned\naround and tried to leave, but Namjoon held his left wrist. Yoongi literally\nhissed and let out a whimper that made Namjoon almost jump back. He quickly\nloosened his grip and rolled Yoongi\u2019s sleeve up, revealing his bandaged arm,\nfrom his wrist, all the way to his elbow. He gasped softly</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u201cNothing\nthat should concern me?\u201d he asked, \u201cDid you get into a fight?\u201d</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Yoongi\nsmiled but his eyes were still filled with sadness \u201cSomething like that\u201d</p><p class=\"fake\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Namjoon\nsighed and kissed his wrist, making the other boy blush. He softly pulled him\ninto a hug, and this time got to hold him for a while. Yoongi let himself get\nimmersed by Namjoon\u2019s body, feeling his scent overflow him. And he felt safe.\nSafer than he\u2019d ever felt before. He smiled to himself secretly. Yeji would\nkill him if she could hear his thoughts\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"2004\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/698027a5191d5be88287b1159587bcdb/tumblr_inline_pfv3w2olvL1uyji0i_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"2004\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"2004\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1f668efe37fbd6e76ba83d514cd0743b/tumblr_inline_pfv3xn5IIl1uyji0i_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"2004\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"></figure><p>***</p><p>They were\nsitting at a restaurant, both silent, for different reasons. Namjoon sighed and\nlet his fork down</p><p>\u201cWill you\ntell me what is going on?\u201d</p><p>Yoongi was\nwearing a huge hoodie, one that almost reached his knees and with sleeves that\nreached under them. Under the hood, he wore a black hat and a mask that covered\nthe majority of his face. Only his eyes were exposed, but the hat did a pretty\ngood job at covering them too. The room was filled with noise from the other\nclients, but Yoongi didn\u2019t say a word. Nor moved. He just stayed still, as if\nhis life depended on it, as he did too often to not be worrying</p><p>\u201cYoon, I\nunderstand that you don\u2019t want to talk about this, but this is getting out of\nhand. I\u2019m worried about you\u201d</p><p>At those\nwords, Yoongi shook his head, still not talking. He faced the window next to\nthem and Namjoon could see his hands shaking. Whatever he was caught up in, it\nwas getting worse from the day that Yeji had left for her studies abroad. He\nwas collapsing right in front of him, and he wouldn\u2019t let him help him</p><p>\u201cYoongi\u201d he\ncaptured his attention again \u201cI can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t let you hurt yourself\nlike this. Ever since Yeji left, you\u2019re always hiding, you miss school days,\nyou cover yourself up as if that will make you invisible, and I really don\u2019t\nknow what to do. I can\u2019t help you if you don\u2019t let me. Just talk to me\u201d</p><p>Silence\nonce more. A few moments later, Yoongi took a napkin, being extra careful as to\nnot let his hands show from under the thick fabric of the hoodie. He scribbled\nsomething and got up, leaving the restaurant without a single word. Namjoon\nrubbed his forehead before reading what was written on the napkin. \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019.\nHe stared at it for a bit, not knowing what to feel, or what that meant. He\nleft some money on the table and ran out, searching for his boyfriend in the\ntiny crowd. It wasn\u2019t hard to spot him; he always stood out to him. He was\nquick to follow him, but when he had the chance to reach him, a little bell\nrang in his head. And so, Kim Namjoon became the creepy guy who follows his\nboyfriend to see what the fuck is going on in that boy\u2019s life. </p><p>They kept\nwalking, Namjoon keeping a safe distance between them, not that the other boy\nwould even turn around to make sure he wasn\u2019t following him, who does that?\nNamjoon, apparently. A few minutes later, he stopped in front of a house. He\nstood at the door for at least five minutes before going in. Was that his\nhouse? It seemed well taken care of from the outside. Namjoon took a deep\nbreath and walked to the entrance, determined to make that boy talk to him,\neven though he shouldn\u2019t pressure him as Yeji had explicitly clarified before\nleaving. He couldn\u2019t just let him destroy himself like that. He was about to\nknock on the door, when he heard a deep, raspy voice coming from inside. He\ncouldn\u2019t quite understand what he was saying, so he approached the window.\nCreepiness out of the roof at this point</p><p>\u201cWhere did\nyou go,\u201d the unknown man said</p><p>\u201cNowhere\u201d\nYoongi\u2019s voice was weird, almost as if he had a terrible cold</p><p>\u201cDid anyone\nsee you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no one\nsaw me\u201d he repeated</p><p>Namjoon\nheard something creaking, probably the man standing up from an old chair \u201cAre\nyou making fun of me, brat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no sir\u201d\nYoongi\u2019s voice cracked and his phone had the worse timing</p><p>The sound\nof an incoming message filled the room</p><p>\u201cThat\nfaggot is texting you again?\u201d he shouted</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call\nhim that!\u201d Yoongi yelled at him at full force, his voice distorted and broken</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nraise your voice at me, you filthy fag!\u201d</p><p>Namjoon had\nheard enough. He busted the door open, just in time to see the huge man ready\nto punch his boyfriend. He felt the world stop and his breath disappearing.\nWithout a second thought, he ran as fast as he could, falling on the man,\nmaking him lose balance and fall on his side. He started groaning, and Namjoon\ncould easily grasp the situation. He was completely drunk, he probably didn\u2019t\neven see him coming and now he was half unconscious. Yoongi was pressed against\nthe wall, looking at him in absolute terror. Namjoon didn\u2019t even think twice\nbefore grabbing his hand and pulling him out of the house. He lifted him up\neasily and Yoongi wrapped his legs around his waist and arms around his\nshoulders as he rested his face on the crook of his neck</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s\nokay baby,\u201d Namjoon said as he kept running, feeling Yoongi\u2019s tears on his\nskin, thanking his decision to not drop the gym \u201cI got you now\u201d</p><p>He kept\nrunning, even when his legs hurt, even when his lungs were threatening to give\nup on him, even when his whole body became numb to everything except for\nYoongi\u2019s shaking body and tight grip. He finally reached Yeji\u2019s place, which\nwas their shelter. All of the boys basically lived there, mostly because Yeji\nloved that house and they didn\u2019t want her to give it up just because she\u2019d been\ngone for a while. And because they had three kids to take care of, something\nthey couldn\u2019t do at their houses. He rushed in and placed his boyfriend gently\non the couch. Yoongi hesitantly let go of him and brought his legs close to his\nchest like he did every time he felt vulnerable and unsafe and hurt. Namjoon\nfell to his knees in front of him, gasping for air. He felt Yoongi\u2019s hands on\nhis shoulders</p><p>\u201cAre you\nokay?\u201d he asked softly</p><p>It had to\nbe incredibly painful for him to talk and Namjoon cursed at himself for not\nunderstanding, for believing that Yoongi was getting caught in random fights.\nWho? Yoongi. How fucking stupid. Once he got a hold of his breathing again, he\nlooked up at him. He could only see his eyes. He reached for his hood, but\nYoongi held him</p><p>\u201cYoongi\u201d he\nwhispered \u201cRemember that time when I was riding Jin\u2019s bicycle? Remember when I\nwas going too fast to come here faster and fell right outside the house? I fell\nflat on my face and was bleeding like crazy. Yeji was worried that I\u2019d need\nstitches after that. Remember that I didn\u2019t want you to see me like that?\u201d\nYoongi nodded silently \u201cRemember what you said to me?\u201d it was almost two years\nago, but that memory was crystal clear in his mind</p><p>Yoongi\ndidn\u2019t answer for a while \u201cI said that I\u2019d love you no matter what scars you\ncarry on you\u201d</p><p>Namjoon\nsmiled \u201cAnd now I understand how important that sentence was and still is to\nyou. So, Yoongi. Will you let me love you with all your scars?\u201d</p><p>Yoongi kept\nholding his boyfriend\u2019s hand for a bit longer, before letting go of him.\nNamjoon was careful in his next moves. He touched him lightly as if to not\nbreak him. He took off his hood, and then his hat. His bangs fell over his\nface, still hiding whatever Yoongi wanted to keep a secret so badly. He ran his\nfingers through his hair softly and reached behind his ears to remove his black\nmask. He took it off slowly, to reveal Yoongi\u2019s face, making him tear up\ninstantly. He hadn\u2019t ever seen any human being so beat up in his whole life.\nHis right cheekbone was swollen and almost black, his nose wasn\u2019t broken by a\nmiracle, his entire lower jaw was awfully bruised, his lips were full of tiny\ncuts and they had dried blood all over them. His neck had the shape of big\nhands around it, and he was pretty sure that it would continue even under the\nhoodie. He rolled up his sleeves to reveal more bruises and cuts from what he\nsupposed were shards of glasses. He placed his forehead on Yoongi\u2019s knees and\ntried, <i>really tried</i> not to cry,\nbecause fucking hell he couldn\u2019t let Yoongi see him cry because of this. But\nhow could he not? How could he not cry his heart out on his boyfriend\u2019s hands\nwhen he had let him go through that alone? How could he keep his calm fa\u00e7ade\nwhen he was faced with so much pain in the eyes of the one he loved so much?\nHow could he not cry out apologies when he couldn\u2019t be there for him after he\nhad promised that he\u2019d always protect him? He was trying to calm himself down\nwhen he felt Yoongi wrapping his arms around him as softly as he could, and\npulling him in the most fragile hug he had ever felt</p><p>\u201cI love\nyou, Namjoon\u201d he whispered. He felt him holding him carefully \u201cWith all of our scars\u201d\nhe continues \u201cWith all of our faults\u201d</p><p>Namjoon\nsmiled \u201cI love you too\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis seems\nlike the proper timing for a kiss, but I doubt either of us would enjoy that\u201d</p><p>They\ngiggled exhausted, and that night, under the faint light of the full moon,\nalone in that familiar living room, they made a silent promise to love each\nother, even when it hurt to do so</p></p>",

Yeji\n&ndash;said best friend- was preparing food for the three little demons she had to\ntake care of. Babysitting Jungkook, Jimin, and Taehyung was her job in her free\ntime since the parents of all three of the tiny humans worked together and were\naway most of the time. She had raised those kids since they were born, and now\nJimin (or Chimmy) and Taehyung (Tata for a very specific group of friends) were\nseven years old and Kookie was five. She adored them, and Namjoon with the rest\nof the group loved them too, but they were too proud to ever admit that. Except\nfor Hoseok. He had no pride in the matter.</p><p>An hour or\nso later, and after the three balls of energy were asleep, Yeji sat on the\ncarpet next to Namjoon and watched him as he played his game passionately. He\nhad his excessively long brown hair on a ponytail to keep them from falling\nover his eyes, something that the rest of the group found hilarious. The door\nunlocked and Yoongi walked in, looking like a zombie. Namjoon felt his cheeks\nburning and the other boy stopped for a moment</p><p>&ldquo;Hey&rdquo; he\nmumbled and had to contain his smile at the sight of the boy&rsquo;s hair &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t\nknow you&rsquo;d be here&rdquo;</p><p>Namjoon\nkept playing even though his mind was somewhere else entirely &ldquo;Yeah, Yeji\nneeded some help with the little ones&rdquo;</p><p>She smiled\nevilly and then looked over at Yoongi &ldquo;Go leave your stuff and wash your hands,\nfood is ready in a bit&rdquo; as soon as he left the room, she faced Namjoon &ldquo;Please\nconfess already&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo; he\nexclaimed &ldquo;No way!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;\nshe smirked and tilted her head playfully</p><p>&ldquo;Because\nI&rsquo;m awkward and he&rsquo;s being just a bit more comfortable around me and I don&rsquo;t\nwanna screw that up&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You do\nrealize that he&rsquo;s more comfortable because you&rsquo;ve shown signs that you like\nhim, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t\nbe so sure&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Honey,\nI&rsquo;ve known him since he was born. Literally. We&rsquo;re living together for the last\nfifteen years. I know him better than he knows himself right now. I might be\nten years older than you guys but I&rsquo;m not old enough to be completely blind.\nAnd he spends most of the day here so he talks to me. Like, a lot&rdquo;</p><p>That seemed\nto capture the boy&rsquo;s attention &ldquo;Did he say anything about me?&rdquo;</p><p>She laughed\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy if you think that I&rsquo;d betray my little bro like that&rdquo;</p><p>He pouted\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure you told him everything I&rsquo;ve ever said to you&rdquo;</p><p>She gasped\ndramatically &ldquo;How dare you question my loyalty? I haven&rsquo;t said a word!&rdquo;</p><p>They both\nlaughed and Yoongi sat next to Namjoon with a long sigh after a few moments\n&ldquo;What are we laughing about?&rdquo; he asked tiredly</p><p>&ldquo;Namjoon\ncompletely failing at this game&rdquo; Yeji smiled and got up &ldquo;Is anyone else\ncoming?&rdquo;</p><p>Yoongi\nlooked up from his phone &ldquo;Uh, I think Hobi is&rdquo;</p><p>Yeji rolled\nher eyes &ldquo;Of course he is&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, and I\nthink Jin is coming too&rdquo; added Namjoon without taking his eyes from the screen</p><p>She stared\nat them &ldquo;I love it when you invite yourselves over&rdquo;</p><p>They both\nsmiled with puppy eyes that made her melt and drop her tough fa&ccedil;ade. She cursed\nfondly under her breath as she dragged them both into the kitchen to help her\nout preparing food for four very hungry teenagers. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;So, uh, in\nshort, well, what I called you here for, uh-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you\nbreaking up with me?&rdquo; Yoongi cut him off</p><p>They were\nsitting at the small table at Yeji&rsquo;s place, keeping an eye on the little ones\neven though they were still sleeping. The others had to go shopping, so they\nshouldn&rsquo;t be back for at least another hour. Yoongi was wearing an oversized\npink hoodie that he had stolen from Yeji, and Namjoon felt his soul leave his\nbody when he saw him in it. He looked like a fluffy marshmallow with his cute\nblack bed hair and pouty lips. One thing he absolutely loved about him was the\nway his lips pouted every time he talked, or how his eyes lit up when he asked\nsomething and the answer would surprise him even in the slightest. What he\ndidn&rsquo;t know, was that Yoongi absolutely adored his dimples. And his big ass\neyes that gave him the feeling that they actually held stars in them, even\nthough that wasn&rsquo;t even possible. And he loved how clumsy he could get,\nespecially when he got nervous about anything, or how his voice was raspy and\ndeep in the morning, and how soft he sounded when humming his favorite songs,\nor how ridiculously good he looked in his big ass glasses</p><p>Namjoon\nlooked at him completely lost &ldquo;Wait, we&rsquo;re already together?&rdquo;</p><p>Yoongi\nblushed and lifted his hoodie so that it would cover his lower face up to his\nnose &ldquo;What the fuck Joon, now I sound dumb and delusional&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You sound\ndumb? I didn&rsquo;t even know we were in a relationship!&rdquo;</p><p>It had been\nmonths of levitating in that weird situation of unofficial dates and countless\nmovie nights and infinite texts and secret looks and hidden smiles</p><p>&ldquo;Dude, I\nthought we were just taking it slow, what did you expect me to think when you\ntext me at three in the morning telling me you think about me and then you hold\nmy hand and cook for me?&rdquo;</p><p>Namjoon\nshrugged &ldquo;That I&rsquo;m a good friend?&rdquo;</p><p>Yoongi\nthrew his hands in the air &ldquo;My boyfriend friend zoned himself for me, what the\nfuck is this&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, am I\nyour boyfriend?!&rdquo; Namjoon shouted</p><p>&ldquo;Well, good\nquestion, I don&rsquo;t even know anymore!&rdquo; he shouted back</p><p>&ldquo;So what do\nwe do?&rdquo; he asked as his cheeks were almost as red as Yoongi&rsquo;s</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t\nknow dude, do you want to be my boyfriend?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hell yeah,\nI do!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cool!&rdquo;</p><p>Yoongi&rsquo;s\nphone started ringing and he quickly picked it up. Namjoon could feel his\nstomach tighten when he saw the exact moment Yoongi&rsquo;s smile faded away, and his\neyes lost their sparkle and became sad and scared. He brought his legs close to\nhim as if to make himself smaller and he bit his lower lip</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he\nsaid in a quiet tone, almost a whisper &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo; He shoved his phone\ninto his pocket and stood up &ldquo;I have to go&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Is\neverything okay? You seem-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,\neverything&rsquo;s fine&rdquo;</p><p>He was gone\nbefore Namjoon could even say anything. Yeji, Hoseok, and Jin came back shortly\nafter, holding a bunch of plastic bags full of groceries. They began to put\neverything in the fridge when she noticed that a certain someone was missing </p><p>&ldquo;Is Yoon\nsleeping already?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I\nthink he went home,&rdquo; he said as he was putting a jar of sauce on the shelf</p><p>She stopped\nmoving and looked at him almost in terror &ldquo;Did someone call him?&rdquo;</p><p>He stopped\ntoo, not sure about why she was so worried suddenly &ldquo;Yeah, he seemed upset\nafter the call and he said he had to leave&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shit&rdquo; she\nleft the bag on the kitchen table &ldquo;Fucking shit, how long ago did he leave?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t\nknow, an hour maybe? Why, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; he had never seen her like this,\ncursing and looking like she was about to kill someone as she grabbed her\njacket</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\ndriving you home, come on&rdquo; she walked to the living room &ldquo;Hoseok, Jin, you too\nguys, everyone go home&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s\nhappening?&rdquo; Namjoon asked as he followed her &ldquo;Did I do something wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>All four of\nthem got out of the house, Hoseok and Jin still out of place, not knowing what\ncould have possibly happened to make Yeji look like that when they always knew\nher as calm and collected</p><p>&ldquo;No honey,\nyou did nothing wrong, but you guys really don&rsquo;t want to be here when I get\nback and-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;\nNamjoon yelled &ldquo;Tell me what&rsquo;s going on&rdquo; everyone stopped &ldquo;I saw that he was\nscared and sad, but I didn&rsquo;t do anything because I didn&rsquo;t know what was\nhappening. So tell me what we are worrying so much about&rdquo;</p><p>She stared\nat him, and her eyes were suddenly filled with the same emotions as Yoongi&rsquo;s\nwere before he left &ldquo;Telling you that, is not my decision to make&rdquo; she said\nsoftly &ldquo;The only thing you need to know, is that the more I stay here, the\nworse it gets. So please, <i>please </i>Namjoon,\nget in the car&rdquo;</p><p>He clenched\nhis jaw and got into the car, slamming the door. Hoseok and Jin lived closer\nthan Namjoon, so they would go home by themselves since the sun was still up. Yeji\nstarted driving and the car was soon enough filled with silence and intense\nstaring</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not\nyour fault Joonie,&rdquo; she said before he could finish his sentence &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have to\ntalk about this at some point, but I can&rsquo;t make him do it before he wants to,\nand I sure as hell can&rsquo;t give him away like that&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is he in\ndanger?&rdquo; </p><p>She looked\nat him and exhaled as calmly as she could &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;</p><p>***</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Namjoon had\nthe biggest bags under his eyes that morning. He didn&rsquo;t get any sleep, nor\nstudied. Yoongi wasn&rsquo;t answering his phone or his messages, and he was so\nworried that he almost started crying when he showed up at school, two hours\nlate and even paler than usual. He ran towards him and hugged him tightly. He\nfelt his hands touching softly his back, before pushing him away. He stepped\nback</p><p>&ldquo;Namjoon!&rdquo;\nhe sounded tired &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do this at school, people are going to talk&rdquo;</p><p>He felt the\nanger burning in the pit of his stomach &ldquo;Are you fucking kidding me?&rdquo; he raised\nhis voice &ldquo;You leave as if someone died!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please\nstop yelling&rdquo; he whispered but Namjoon spoke almost over him</p><p>&ldquo;Then Yeji\nacts like someone is going to kill you!&rdquo; he kept going</p><p>&ldquo;Namjoon\nplease-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t\npick up your phone!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nam-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t\nanswer my messages!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please,\nI-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you\nworry about what people will say? Really? That&rsquo;s so fucking-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For fuck&rsquo;s\nsake Namjoon, please stop!&rdquo;</p><p>He yelled\nback, loudly enough to make half of the kids in the hall look at them. Namjoon\nremained silent, as he saw Yoongi&rsquo;s eyes full of tears and his hands clenched\nin fists at his sides. His nose and cheeks were red. <i>Was he already crying before getting there? </i>He sighed and walked\npast him, followed by a very concerned Hoseok who whispered something between\nthe lines of <i>you really don&rsquo;t know when\nto stop, do you?</i> Jin approached him and patted his shoulder</p><p>&ldquo;Did I fuck\nup?&rdquo; he asked as he tried to spot his boyfriend leaving</p><p>&ldquo;Would it\nbe you if you hadn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p><p>***</p><p>Hoseok sat\nnext to Namjoon when the bell rang. Yoongi was already in his seat, a few desks\nbehind them, hood covering half of his face, his look glued to the ground, his\nbackpack still untouched </p><p>&ldquo;Is he\nokay?&rdquo; Namjoon whispered to his friend</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t\nknow man; something really fucked up is going on with him&rdquo;</p><p>He coughed\n&ldquo;What the fuck do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>Hoseok\ncaught his angry tone immediately &ldquo;Chill yo tits, Romeo, I&rsquo;m not saying he&rsquo;s\ndoing something wrong, but you seriously have to talk to him&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t\nthink he even wants to talk to me&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you\nkidding me?&rdquo; he had to lower his voice before continuing &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dying to talk to\nyou, but he&rsquo;s scared. You haven&rsquo;t ever raised your voice like that, and\napparently, he&rsquo;s pretty sensitive to that stuff&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait&hellip;\nDid I scare him?&rdquo;</p><p>Hoseok hit\nhis forehead &ldquo;Bitch, you didn&rsquo;t scare him, you fucking terrified him. You\nalmost scared<i> me</i>; you have no idea\nhow you looked like when you yelled at him in the hallway. I was like, ready to\njump out and drag him away, you looked furious&rdquo;</p><p>Namjoon\nlooked behind them, only to find Yoongi in the exact same position. He hadn&rsquo;t\nmoved an inch &ldquo;Fine, I&rsquo;ll talk to him when we&rsquo;re over&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You better\nbe calm as fuck or I&rsquo;ll seriously beat you up&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re\nsuddenly surprisingly fond of him, and you sound almost overprotective&rdquo;</p><p>Hoseok\nlooked at him dead serious &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll understand&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>They were\nstanding on campus, only the two of them, face to face. Yoongi was looking\ndown, while Namjoon didn&rsquo;t know what to do</p><p>&ldquo;Can I-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry\nI disappeared like that. I&rsquo;m sorry Yeji made you worry even more. I&rsquo;m sorry I\ndidn&rsquo;t answer your messages&rdquo; he talked like a soldier &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I raised my\nvoice at you&rdquo;</p><p>Namjoon\nfroze. He sounded like a robot, like he was programmed to say something like\nthat. He raised his hand to pat his head and he saw him stiffen, shutting his\neyes and clenching his jaw, almost as he expected him to hit him</p><p>&ldquo;What is\nhappening to you, Yoongi?&rdquo; he whispered</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing\nthat should concern you&rdquo; </p><p>He turned\naround and tried to leave, but Namjoon held his left wrist. Yoongi literally\nhissed and let out a whimper that made Namjoon almost jump back. He quickly\nloosened his grip and rolled Yoongi&rsquo;s sleeve up, revealing his bandaged arm,\nfrom his wrist, all the way to his elbow. He gasped softly</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing\nthat should concern me?&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;Did you get into a fight?&rdquo;</p><p>Yoongi\nsmiled but his eyes were still filled with sadness &ldquo;Something like that&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p>Namjoon\nsighed and kissed his wrist, making the other boy blush. He softly pulled him\ninto a hug, and this time got to hold him for a while. Yoongi let himself get\nimmersed by Namjoon&rsquo;s body, feeling his scent overflow him. And he felt safe.\nSafer than he&rsquo;d ever felt before. He smiled to himself secretly. Yeji would\nkill him if she could hear his thoughts&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/698027a5191d5be88287b1159587bcdb/tumblr_inline_pfv3w2olvL1uyji0i_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1f668efe37fbd6e76ba83d514cd0743b/tumblr_inline_pfv3xn5IIl1uyji0i_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>***</p><p>They were\nsitting at a restaurant, both silent, for different reasons. Namjoon sighed and\nlet his fork down</p><p>&ldquo;Will you\ntell me what is going on?&rdquo;</p><p>Yoongi was\nwearing a huge hoodie, one that almost reached his knees and with sleeves that\nreached under them. Under the hood, he wore a black hat and a mask that covered\nthe majority of his face. Only his eyes were exposed, but the hat did a pretty\ngood job at covering them too. The room was filled with noise from the other\nclients, but Yoongi didn&rsquo;t say a word. Nor moved. He just stayed still, as if\nhis life depended on it, as he did too often to not be worrying</p><p>&ldquo;Yoon, I\nunderstand that you don&rsquo;t want to talk about this, but this is getting out of\nhand. I&rsquo;m worried about you&rdquo;</p><p>At those\nwords, Yoongi shook his head, still not talking. He faced the window next to\nthem and Namjoon could see his hands shaking. Whatever he was caught up in, it\nwas getting worse from the day that Yeji had left for her studies abroad. He\nwas collapsing right in front of him, and he wouldn&rsquo;t let him help him</p><p>&ldquo;Yoongi&rdquo; he\ncaptured his attention again &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do this. I can&rsquo;t let you hurt yourself\nlike this. Ever since Yeji left, you&rsquo;re always hiding, you miss school days,\nyou cover yourself up as if that will make you invisible, and I really don&rsquo;t\nknow what to do. I can&rsquo;t help you if you don&rsquo;t let me. Just talk to me&rdquo;</p><p>Silence\nonce more. A few moments later, Yoongi took a napkin, being extra careful as to\nnot let his hands show from under the thick fabric of the hoodie. He scribbled\nsomething and got up, leaving the restaurant without a single word. Namjoon\nrubbed his forehead before reading what was written on the napkin. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rsquo;.\nHe stared at it for a bit, not knowing what to feel, or what that meant. He\nleft some money on the table and ran out, searching for his boyfriend in the\ntiny crowd. It wasn&rsquo;t hard to spot him; he always stood out to him. He was\nquick to follow him, but when he had the chance to reach him, a little bell\nrang in his head. And so, Kim Namjoon became the creepy guy who follows his\nboyfriend to see what the fuck is going on in that boy&rsquo;s life. </p><p>They kept\nwalking, Namjoon keeping a safe distance between them, not that the other boy\nwould even turn around to make sure he wasn&rsquo;t following him, who does that?\nNamjoon, apparently. A few minutes later, he stopped in front of a house. He\nstood at the door for at least five minutes before going in. Was that his\nhouse? It seemed well taken care of from the outside. Namjoon took a deep\nbreath and walked to the entrance, determined to make that boy talk to him,\neven though he shouldn&rsquo;t pressure him as Yeji had explicitly clarified before\nleaving. He couldn&rsquo;t just let him destroy himself like that. He was about to\nknock on the door, when he heard a deep, raspy voice coming from inside. He\ncouldn&rsquo;t quite understand what he was saying, so he approached the window.\nCreepiness out of the roof at this point</p><p>&ldquo;Where did\nyou go,&rdquo; the unknown man said</p><p>&ldquo;Nowhere&rdquo;\nYoongi&rsquo;s voice was weird, almost as if he had a terrible cold</p><p>&ldquo;Did anyone\nsee you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no one\nsaw me&rdquo; he repeated</p><p>Namjoon\nheard something creaking, probably the man standing up from an old chair &ldquo;Are\nyou making fun of me, brat?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;N-no sir&rdquo;\nYoongi&rsquo;s voice cracked and his phone had the worse timing</p><p>The sound\nof an incoming message filled the room</p><p>&ldquo;That\nfaggot is texting you again?&rdquo; he shouted</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call\nhim that!&rdquo; Yoongi yelled at him at full force, his voice distorted and broken</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t\nraise your voice at me, you filthy fag!&rdquo;</p><p>Namjoon had\nheard enough. He busted the door open, just in time to see the huge man ready\nto punch his boyfriend. He felt the world stop and his breath disappearing.\nWithout a second thought, he ran as fast as he could, falling on the man,\nmaking him lose balance and fall on his side. He started groaning, and Namjoon\ncould easily grasp the situation. He was completely drunk, he probably didn&rsquo;t\neven see him coming and now he was half unconscious. Yoongi was pressed against\nthe wall, looking at him in absolute terror. Namjoon didn&rsquo;t even think twice\nbefore grabbing his hand and pulling him out of the house. He lifted him up\neasily and Yoongi wrapped his legs around his waist and arms around his\nshoulders as he rested his face on the crook of his neck</p><p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s\nokay baby,&rdquo; Namjoon said as he kept running, feeling Yoongi&rsquo;s tears on his\nskin, thanking his decision to not drop the gym &ldquo;I got you now&rdquo;</p><p>He kept\nrunning, even when his legs hurt, even when his lungs were threatening to give\nup on him, even when his whole body became numb to everything except for\nYoongi&rsquo;s shaking body and tight grip. He finally reached Yeji&rsquo;s place, which\nwas their shelter. All of the boys basically lived there, mostly because Yeji\nloved that house and they didn&rsquo;t want her to give it up just because she&rsquo;d been\ngone for a while. And because they had three kids to take care of, something\nthey couldn&rsquo;t do at their houses. He rushed in and placed his boyfriend gently\non the couch. Yoongi hesitantly let go of him and brought his legs close to his\nchest like he did every time he felt vulnerable and unsafe and hurt. Namjoon\nfell to his knees in front of him, gasping for air. He felt Yoongi&rsquo;s hands on\nhis shoulders</p><p>&ldquo;Are you\nokay?&rdquo; he asked softly</p><p>It had to\nbe incredibly painful for him to talk and Namjoon cursed at himself for not\nunderstanding, for believing that Yoongi was getting caught in random fights.\nWho? Yoongi. How fucking stupid. Once he got a hold of his breathing again, he\nlooked up at him. He could only see his eyes. He reached for his hood, but\nYoongi held him</p><p>&ldquo;Yoongi&rdquo; he\nwhispered &ldquo;Remember that time when I was riding Jin&rsquo;s bicycle? Remember when I\nwas going too fast to come here faster and fell right outside the house? I fell\nflat on my face and was bleeding like crazy. Yeji was worried that I&rsquo;d need\nstitches after that. Remember that I didn&rsquo;t want you to see me like that?&rdquo;\nYoongi nodded silently &ldquo;Remember what you said to me?&rdquo; it was almost two years\nago, but that memory was crystal clear in his mind</p><p>Yoongi\ndidn&rsquo;t answer for a while &ldquo;I said that I&rsquo;d love you no matter what scars you\ncarry on you&rdquo;</p><p>Namjoon\nsmiled &ldquo;And now I understand how important that sentence was and still is to\nyou. So, Yoongi. Will you let me love you with all your scars?&rdquo;</p><p>Yoongi kept\nholding his boyfriend&rsquo;s hand for a bit longer, before letting go of him.\nNamjoon was careful in his next moves. He touched him lightly as if to not\nbreak him. He took off his hood, and then his hat. His bangs fell over his\nface, still hiding whatever Yoongi wanted to keep a secret so badly. He ran his\nfingers through his hair softly and reached behind his ears to remove his black\nmask. He took it off slowly, to reveal Yoongi&rsquo;s face, making him tear up\ninstantly. He hadn&rsquo;t ever seen any human being so beat up in his whole life.\nHis right cheekbone was swollen and almost black, his nose wasn&rsquo;t broken by a\nmiracle, his entire lower jaw was awfully bruised, his lips were full of tiny\ncuts and they had dried blood all over them. His neck had the shape of big\nhands around it, and he was pretty sure that it would continue even under the\nhoodie. He rolled up his sleeves to reveal more bruises and cuts from what he\nsupposed were shards of glasses. He placed his forehead on Yoongi&rsquo;s knees and\ntried, <i>really tried</i> not to cry,\nbecause fucking hell he couldn&rsquo;t let Yoongi see him cry because of this. But\nhow could he not? How could he not cry his heart out on his boyfriend&rsquo;s hands\nwhen he had let him go through that alone? How could he keep his calm fa&ccedil;ade\nwhen he was faced with so much pain in the eyes of the one he loved so much?\nHow could he not cry out apologies when he couldn&rsquo;t be there for him after he\nhad promised that he&rsquo;d always protect him? He was trying to calm himself down\nwhen he felt Yoongi wrapping his arms around him as softly as he could, and\npulling him in the most fragile hug he had ever felt</p><p>&ldquo;I love\nyou, Namjoon&rdquo; he whispered. He felt him holding him carefully &ldquo;With all of our scars&rdquo;\nhe continues &ldquo;With all of our faults&rdquo;</p><p>Namjoon\nsmiled &ldquo;I love you too&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This seems\nlike the proper timing for a kiss, but I doubt either of us would enjoy that&rdquo;</p><p>They\ngiggled exhausted, and that night, under the faint light of the full moon,\nalone in that familiar living room, they made a silent promise to love each\nother, even when it hurt to do so</p></p>",
