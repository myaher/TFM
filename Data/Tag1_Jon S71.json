The show&rsquo;s been pouring these sentimental moments over us lately, to the point where there&rsquo;s gone inflation in the Stark hugfests, but even if they aren&rsquo;t really that important, this one had merit. For one, it&rsquo;s the one reunion scene all fans of the show have been rooting for since the very first episodes. For the other, this has to be the first time we get to see Arya smiling and happy, almost acting like a little girl again, since her father was decapitated. Even her look of awe as she first lays eyes on her brother again, heading the giant army marching into their home, is absolutely fantastic.</p><p>The second, less pleasant and more significant, involves Cersei&rsquo;s decision to task Bron with murdering both her brothers, veering dangerously close to putting her in comic book villain territory. Killing Tyrion? Sure, I can buy that, I&rsquo;m wondering why she hasn&rsquo;t been harder at work on it for years.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"789\" data-orig-width=\"1402\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/011a9e7ad42f13dfaf16c44b13109799/tumblr_inline_pq69opSe561rldjdw_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"789\" data-orig-width=\"1402\"/></figure><p>Jaime? No. True, they did not depart on the best of terms, but this is the closest thing Cersei&rsquo;s had to that &ldquo;one true love&rdquo; in all her life. Furthermore, I can&rsquo;t even think of an earlier time where Jaime openly defies her will, and his motive isn&rsquo;t even to spite her \u2013 it&rsquo;s to make good on his word. One could argue that an extension of their unofficial family motto. Making sense of her reaction, one could assume she isn&rsquo;t capable of entering any real emotional relationship where the counterpart isn&rsquo;t her slave and she isn&rsquo;t in total control of everything.</p><p>Crossing this line strips her of all redeeming qualities as a person, and her subsequent bored hookup with Euron \u2013 arrogant and self-assured like the Jaime of old, but also a perverted and sadistic thug with no moral stature or higher calling whatsoever, but a shade or two removed from Ramsay Bolton \u2013 feels both earned and appalling.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know why the show takes this step. It could be a catalyst to bond the two feuding Lannister brothers together, or maybe the writers are prepared to sacrifice some of Cersei&rsquo;s believability as a character for some central purpose. That doesn&rsquo;t make it good, and I&rsquo;m left on the fence on this one.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"788\" data-orig-width=\"1402\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3cbe1d49106030b8fa9cbc1f0c18621a/tumblr_inline_pq69pwgFKQ1rldjdw_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"788\" data-orig-width=\"1402\"/></figure><p>The third scene is Jon and Dany&rsquo;s romantic getaway with the dragons.

She started the victim, progressed the hero and is now found out the would-be tyrant. </p><p>It&rsquo;s true, other people considered both noble and worthy by the show have killed many men by the laws of their lands, but what Dany is guilty of is executing prisoners of war in order to scare her foes into submission, and that&rsquo;s hardly noble. Through this episode, circumstances cause the perfect storm to have her cruelty come back to bite her \u2013 in a rare occasion for <i>Game of Thrones</i>, this is the one bad deed that won&rsquo;t go unpunished.</p><p>Anyone who&rsquo;d think this could go away \u2013 we&rsquo;ve never seen Sam truly angry before, hurt to his very core and or using all his guns to hurt someone as he does Dany through the revelation of Jon&rsquo;s birthright. For such a gentle soul, this is quietly frightening. He&rsquo;s both clever, determined and arguably even righteous in his hatred. This will only solve through the destruction of the other party, and Sam&rsquo;s been Jon&rsquo;s best friend since the very first episodes. </p><p>Some people thought the show was sweeping Dany&rsquo;s flaws under the rug to keep her the shining figurehead. That was wrong. On the contrary, the way the scene plays out shows a nuanced understanding of the spirit of the source material on the part of the screenwriters.

For one, it\u2019s the one reunion scene all fans of the show have been rooting for since the very first episodes. For the other, this has to be the first time we get to see Arya smiling and happy, almost acting like a little girl again, since her father was decapitated.
