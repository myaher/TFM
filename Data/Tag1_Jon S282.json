Which &hellip; honestly doesn\u2019t make much sense to me. Let me tell you why:</p><p><b>1. Rhaegar was already dead when Jon was born</b>. A situation like this could have never happened.\u00a0</p><p><b>2. We know that Rhaegar thought Aegon was the prince that was promised.</b></p><blockquote><p><i>[&hellip;] but later he became persuaded that it was his own son who fulfilled the prophecy, for a comet had been seen above King&rsquo;s Landing on the night Aegon was conceived, and Rhaegar was certain the bleeding star had to be a comet. \n\n</i><br/></p><p>A Feast for Crows - Samwell IV<br/></p></blockquote><p><b>3.\u00a0\u00a0Rhaegar had two children already and after naming his second one says this:\u00a0</b><i><b>&ldquo;There must be one more,&rdquo; he said, [&hellip;]\u00a0\n\n&ldquo;The dragon has three heads.&rdquo;.</b> </i>To me, the most logical meaning of this would be that Rhaegar thought he needed a third child. Rhaegar saying this after Jon\u2019s birth, when he already has three children, doesn\u2019t make much sense<i> <strike>unless we assume that he wanted three Aegons from three different mothers which &hellip; I don\u2019t really believe</strike>. </i>I honestly can\u2019t think of any plausible explanation why he would say this in connection to Jon\u2019s birth. Other than Jon being the third head and not the baby in the vision itself.\u00a0</p><p><b>4.\u00a0\n\n</b><i><b>&ldquo;He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire.&rdquo;</b> </i>I think this line is the main reason why people think it\u2019s Lyanna/Jon and not Elia/Aegon. After all, Jon is considered a potential candidate for this prophesied position and\u00a0\u201cIce and Fire\u201d is often associated with him because of his Stark/Targaryen parentage (<i>ie being a product of the long promised\u00a0\u201cPact of Ice and Fire\u201d). </i>However,\u00a0\u201cthe song of ice and fire\u201d could also be a poetic term for the\u00a0\u201cwar between ice and fire\u201d, just as\u00a0\u201cdance of dragons\u201d is a poetic term for a\u00a0\u201cwar between dragons\u201d.</p><blockquote><p><i>The war has been waged since time began, and before it is done, all men must choose where they will stand. <b>On one side is R'hllor,</b> the Lord of Light, <b>the Heart of Fire,</b> the God of Flame and Shadow. <b>Against him stands the Great Other</b> whose name may not be spoken, the Lord of Darkness, <b>the Soul of Ice</b>, the God of Night and Terror.\n\n</i><br/></p><p><i>A Storm of Swords - Davos III<br/></i></p></blockquote><p><b>The prince that was promised or azor ahai reborn is R\u2019hllors chosen one, the warrior of light and son of fire, who will decide the outcome of this war.</b> <b>Making this war, \u201cthe song of ice and fire\u201d,\u00a0<i>his</i>.\u00a0</b></p><p>To summarize: Everything adds up nicely to it being Aegon, while there are two important aspects to this vision that don\u2019t add up at all to it being Jon. Ergo, it\u2019s most likely Aegon, not Jon. Also, Last but not least:\u00a0</p><p><b>5.\u00a0</b>According to <a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/15608\">westeros.org</a> <b>Grrm himself has confirmed that it\u2019s Rhaegar and Elia</b> back in 1998. Unfortunately not a direct link to Grrm but I consider Ran to be a credible source. So there\u2019s that.\u00a0</p>",

        "body": "<p>\nI read that theory sometime ago and it is interesting to consider. It \ndoesn&rsquo;t need to happen to make it interesting or fun. In particular it \nwould require careful timeline planning to make it happen and given the \nbig timeline issues in the series, it may be indeed difficult. Let&rsquo;s first consider the \nStark succession crisis.\n</p><p>\n<b>The Stark succession crisis</b> refers to the (hopefully \nnon violent) conflict among the different claimants to Winterfell and \ntheir supporters. In my opinion, the conflict will be cut short by the \nfall of the Wall. But let&rsquo;s review it.\n</p><p>\nAt the time of Ned&rsquo;s death the succession was clear. Robb, Bran, Rickon,\n Sansa and Arya. Jon (as Ned Stark bastard) would be considered only in \nvery exceptional circumstances.\n</p><p>\nNow, Robb is death. Bran, Rickon and Arya are believed dead. Sansa married to the\n enemy. Jon joined the Night Watch so he renounced to any feeble claim \nhe ever had.\n</p><p>\nHowever King Robb altered that in his last will. Whilst we do not know the \nexact contents of that will (not even its current location), it is \ncertainly contain - at the very least - a legitimization for Jon, putting \nhim ahead in the succession list as the eldest brother. The will may \nalso contain other things like orders to preserve the realm, provisions \nagainst Sansa Lannister (was she disinherited?), etc, but these are more\n speculative.\n</p><p>\nWe know however that Bran, Rickon and Arya are not dead and thus have a \ndefinite claim to Winterfell. At the same time there seems to be \ndefinite plans by Littlefinger to put Sansa in Winterfell. Jon has just \nbeen killed. So, the situation is more complicated than Robb ever \nenvisioned.\n</p><p>\nAt the end of ADWD, it is likely that the content of the will is not \nwidely known among the Northern Lords. So, other lords are acting \nindependently for a Stark restoration. \u00a0Specifically Manderly. So, let&rsquo;s\n revise the claims as ordered by Robb&rsquo;s will and the problems for each \nclaimant.\n</p><ol><li>\n<b>Jon</b>: Not a son of Ned Stark. Although I think this will\n not be known for a while, a key personage (Howland Reed) will see that \nJon&rsquo;s legitimization creates a big problem ahead. Jon is also sworn to \nthe Night Watch and thus cannot claim lands. We don&rsquo;t know how dead and \nresurrection change that. Some of the Northern Lords will claim that the\n will was issued under false premises so is not valid anymore, whilst\n at the same time others will prefer to honor it. King Stannis will \nlikely have a say and may prefer Jon over the other options.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Bran</b>: The true heir of Robb Stark. The Mountain Clans \nknow he is alive, now missing in the vastness beyond the Wall, so \ncurrently unavailable. Although he is going to show supernatural powers \nit may be that the only way to effectively communicate is through ravens\n or Theon Turncloack. He is also a cripple and has a Tully look.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Rickon</b>: He is a child, so there will be need of a long \nregency. Supported by powerful White Harbor, which means that the \nManderlys will become too powerful for the taste of other Northern \nLords. He may be already back (I think not, but there has been enough \ntime) with an army of Skagosi mounted in unicorns and White \nHarbor knights. He also has a Tully look.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Sansa</b>: Married to a Lannister. If she marries again, \nshe will be looked even with more suspicion. Backed by an ambitious, sly\n and upjumped coin counter. Backed by the powerful army of the Vale, the\n most Andal of the 7 Kingdoms and the strongest followers of the Seven. \nOn the practical side, she has to offer the Vale foodstores to the hungry \nNorth.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Arya</b>: Nobody ever mention Arya in this thing, so here goes the little theory\n</li>\n</ol><p>\nPeople have kind of guessed that Arya will return to the Riverlands at \nsome point. Why? There are too many elements of her story that link her \nthere. Nymeria, Gendry, Hot Pie, Sandor, Brienne, TBWB and her mother \n(or whatever remains of her).\n</p><p>\nI think that the theory that Arya will be the one who puts LS out of her\n misery is quite compelling. If this is true, Arya will become strongly \ninvolved in The Brotherhood without Banners and she may be wooed to \nclaim Winterfell (by some northmen, for example) if they do not know who\n rules there. She may be even declared Queen then and there. She will \nhave the support of TBWB, of the remaining northmen in the Riverlands, \nthe Nymeria pack, the Blackfish (eventually) and she will take \npossession of her late brother crown.\n</p><p>\nThis is a good way to bring some key people north, where they are \nneeded, like Brienne, Sandor, Gendry, Thoros, maybe even Jaime.\n</p><p>\nShe may lay down her claim after meeting her siblings but if the \nsituation is too complicated she may also be compelled to press on.\n</p>",

So, let\u2019s\n revise the claims as ordered by Robb\u2019s will and the problems for each \nclaimant.\n</p><ol><li>\n<b>Jon</b>: Not a son of Ned Stark. Although I think this will\n not be known for a while, a key personage (Howland Reed) will see that \nJon\u2019s legitimization creates a big problem ahead. Jon is also sworn to \nthe Night Watch and thus cannot claim lands. We don\u2019t know how dead and \nresurrection change that. Some of the Northern Lords will claim that the\n will was issued under false premises so is not valid anymore, whilst\n at the same time others will prefer to honor it. King Stannis will \nlikely have a say and may prefer Jon over the other options.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Bran</b>: The true heir of Robb Stark. The Mountain Clans \nknow he is alive, now missing in the vastness beyond the Wall, so \ncurrently unavailable. Although he is going to show supernatural powers \nit may be that the only way to effectively communicate is through ravens\n or Theon Turncloack. He is also a cripple and has a Tully look.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Rickon</b>: He is a child, so there will be need of a long \nregency. Supported by powerful White Harbor, which means that the \nManderlys will become too powerful for the taste of other Northern \nLords. He may be already back (I think not, but there has been enough \ntime) with an army of Skagosi mounted in unicorns and White \nHarbor knights. He also has a Tully look.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Sansa</b>: Married to a Lannister. If she marries again, \nshe will be looked even with more suspicion. Backed by an ambitious, sly\n and upjumped coin counter. Backed by the powerful army of the Vale, the\n most Andal of the 7 Kingdoms and the strongest followers of the Seven. \nOn the practical side, she has to offer the Vale foodstores to the hungry \nNorth.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Arya</b>: Nobody ever mention Arya in this thing, so here goes the little theory\n</li>\n</ol><p>\nPeople have kind of guessed that Arya will return to the Riverlands at \nsome point. Why? There are too many elements of her story that link her \nthere. Nymeria, Gendry, Hot Pie, Sandor, Brienne, TBWB and her mother \n(or whatever remains of her).\n</p><p>\nI think that the theory that Arya will be the one who puts LS out of her\n misery is quite compelling. If this is true, Arya will become strongly \ninvolved in The Brotherhood without Banners and she may be wooed to \nclaim Winterfell (by some northmen, for example) if they do not know who\n rules there. She may be even declared Queen then and there. She will \nhave the support of TBWB, of the remaining northmen in the Riverlands, \nthe Nymeria pack, the Blackfish (eventually) and she will take \npossession of her late brother crown.\n</p><p>\nThis is a good way to bring some key people north, where they are \nneeded, like Brienne, Sandor, Gendry, Thoros, maybe even Jaime.\n</p><p>\nShe may lay down her claim after meeting her siblings but if the \nsituation is too complicated she may also be compelled to press on.\n</p>",
