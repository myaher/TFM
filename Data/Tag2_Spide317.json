The black car your mother had taken to\nthe school was a company car \u2013 a government car. With a driver. It\nall seemed so cold and official. Your mom was crying beside you in\nthe backseat but unsuccessfully trying to hide it, for your sake. She\ntried to explain through her sobs what happened at your father&rsquo;s\nworkplace, but it seemed that she didn&rsquo;t really know many details at\nall. Everything government-related was secretive, especially when it\nconcerned alien affairs, and <i>especially </i>when\nthe word &lsquo;accident&rsquo; was thrown around. You were sure that they were\nkeeping you and your mother in the dark about what happened \u2013 you&rsquo;d\nbet money that they always knew more than they were saying.</p><p>The man in the suit\nand sunglasses behind the wheel never said a word and his facial\nexpression never changed throughout the drive to the hospital. He\nseemed entirely uninviting. You noticed a bulge at his side\nunderneath his suit jacket, and it didn&rsquo;t take more than a moment to\nrealize that it was a gun. Of course it was. What was he,\nsecurity detail? To keep you and your mother safe or to maybe keep\nyou two from probing more than you should be into the incident?\nEither way, you found his presence completely unnecessary and a bit\nunnerving.</p><p>Pulling up to the\nhospital, you threw open the SUV door before the vehicle was\ncompletely stopped and ran toward the doors despite your mother&rsquo;s\nprotests. The lobby was cold and sterile, bringing chill bumps to\nyour arms. Your sense of foreboding only heightened.</p><p>\u201cBaby, don&rsquo;t go\nrunning off like that,\u201d you heard your mother beg from behind you,\nresting her shaking hands on your shoulders. \u201cI know that you want\nto see your dad, and\u2014and that this is scary, but we&rsquo;ve gotta stick\ntogether.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>You didn&rsquo;t respond,\nwatching as the large man that drove the SUV motion for you two to\nfollow him down a nearby hallway. You followed his lead in a blur.\nThe hospital wing was deserted, all the doors down the blindingly\nwhite hallway ajar, allowing you to peer into the rooms. Every bed\nwas perfectly made, a fresh vase of flowers by every window. It was\nalmost eerie.</p><p>\u201cFor security\nreasons,\u201d came a deep voice through the haze. You looked into the\ndark sunglasses that looked back at you before they turned away. \u201cNo\none underneath or above the floor our people are on. We don&rsquo;t want\nanyone here that shouldn&rsquo;t be, and it&rsquo;s a hell of a lot easier to\nspot someone who doesn&rsquo;t belong when no one should be in this hallway\nin the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely \u2013 I\nmean, but patients were here, right?\u201d you stuttered. \u201cWhere did\nthey go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomewhere else,\u201d\nhe replied shortly, making it clear that the conversation was over.\nYou glanced back at your mother, who shrugged and gave you a look\nthat clearly said \u201c<i>stop asking questions</i>\u201d.</p><p>The three of you\napproached an elevator at the end of the off-putting corridor. There\nwasn&rsquo;t an up or down button, but a keypad and a finger print scanner.\nYour brows furrowed. Why in the hell was this place like a disguised\nprison instead of a hospital? Who\u2014or <i>what</i>\u2014was your father\nbeing protected from? A shiver ran down your spine.</p><p>The large man\nobscured your view with his shoulder blades, leaning down to punch in a\ncombination and scan his fingerprint. It was clear that you weren&rsquo;t\nsupposed to know how to get into this elevator without supervision.\nBut this was your <i>dad\u2014</i>he\ndidn&rsquo;t need protecting from you, from his family.</p><p>A\nloud alarm sounded throughout the hallway as the elevator arrived.\nYou were sure that everyone in the hospital could hear it, and maybe\nthat was the point\u2014no surprise visitors. The blaring ceased as the\ndoors opened and the three of you stepped inside. It was stainless\nsteel and spotless, sterile, like everything else around you.\nYou weren&rsquo;t sure if this was comforting you, or the opposite. It was\nclean, but there was no warmth.</p><p>The\nelevator did not have any indicator or screen that told you what\nfloor you were arriving to. You gulped as the doors finally parted\nfor you, a hallway even more blindingly white meeting your vision,\nbut this time it was full of people bustling around, all seemingly in\na hurry. Nurses were in protective suits, masks covering their faces,\nas they entered a room at the very end of the hallway with a large\ncaution indicator flashing above it. You couldn&rsquo;t believe what you\nwere seeing. It was like a scene from a science fiction movie.</p><p>\u201cYour\nfather isn&rsquo;t in there,\u201d a deep voice said, pulling you from your\nthoughts. Was that meant to be comforting? You looked up at his stony\nface, his lense-covered eyes betraying nothing. He simply motioned to\nhis right, down a separate hallway. You followed the\nbodyguard/driver/assassin/whatever-the-hell-he-was down the corridor,\nyour mother&rsquo;s hand raising to squeeze your shoulder again. He stopped\nat a door to his right and stepped to the side, his back against the\ndoor frame and clasping his fists in front of him, like a guard. He\nlooked at you and nodded toward the room, but then faced forward and\ngave no indication after that acknowledging your existence.</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;ll\nbe alright, honey,\u201d your mother whispered into your ear as you\nslowly stepped into the room, hands balled into fists at your sides.\nWould your father be awake, be responsive? Would he be covered in\ncasts and bandages to the point of being unrecognizable? Would he be\nhooked up to machines with an endless array of wires? Would he be\n<i>okay</i>?</p><p>Your\nfather&rsquo;s bed came into view, but he was blocked by a team of nurses,\nchecking a few machines and muttering to each other in hushed tones.\nThe four women buzzing around his bed like bees around a hive made\nyour stomach churn.</p><p>\u201cOh,\nthe family&rsquo;s here,\u201d one announced, stepping back and sending you a\nsmall smile. The others looked up and quickly finished up whatever\nthey were doing. You still couldn&rsquo;t see him.</p><p>\u201cIs\nhe okay?\u201d you asked, not recognizing the weak voice that came out\nof your mouth. \u201cWhat happened? Why\u2014why does he need all of these\nmachines? What\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe&rsquo;re\nkeeping an eye on him,\u201d answered the nurse, resting two of her\nhands on your shoulders as if to anchor you down. She smiled but her\neyes betrayed nothing, just like your security guard by the door. It\nwas then that you realized everyone here was the same: they&rsquo;d tell\nyou the bare minimum to keep whatever the hell happened at your dad&rsquo;s\nplace of work under wraps.</p><p>Frustration\nburned in your veins like hot coals, and your face must&rsquo;ve shown it,\nbecause her hands hastily left your shoulders and the nurses\nretreated from the room, taking every trace of paperwork with them.</p><p>And then you saw him.</p><p>He\nwas a pitiful sight, a bundle of bandages and blankets. Half of his\nface was obscured by gauze which had freshly been changed, his\nvisible eye swollen shut. He had a large chunk of hair missing from\nthe right side of his scalp, more gauze and wrappings covering the\narea. If you didn&rsquo;t know better, you&rsquo;d say he looked&hellip; <i>burned</i>.</p><p>You\nsucked in a deep, trembling breath at the sight of him, reaching to\nhold his hand but finding that it was covered in a bulky cast. Your\nthroat ached, tears rushing down your face despite your effort to\nkeep them walled back. \n</p><p><i>What happened?</i></p><p>Your mother sat at a\nchair on the other side of his bed, hands clasped over her mouth as\nif it would hold back the gasping sobs escaping her. The sound did\nnothing to strengthen your resolve.</p><p>\u201c<i>Daddy</i>&hellip;\u201d\nyou whispered, softly touching the unblistered fingertips protruding\nfrom his cast. His bandaged face swam in your vision as more tears\nbetrayed you, making the room a blur of bright white light and\nswimming shapes.</p><p>As\nyour mother&rsquo;s cries echoed throughout the room, mixing with yours in\na chorus of heart-wrenching wails, you collapsed to your knees,\nholding onto your father&rsquo;s unresponsive fingertips like they&rsquo;d keep\nyou from drowning in a sea of your own tears.</p><p>In\nthat moment, as you felt yourself slip into a void, and saw your rock\nof a mother look more defeated than you&rsquo;d ever thought possible, you\ndecided something.</p><p>You&rsquo;d\nfind out what happened to your father. \n</p><p>No\nmatter what it took.</p><hr><p>You\nmissed school the next day, refusing to leave your dad&rsquo;s side. You\ndidn&rsquo;t eat, you didn&rsquo;t sleep, you didn&rsquo;t even go to the bathroom\nunless you absolutely couldn&rsquo;t hold it anymore, afraid you&rsquo;d miss\nsomething. The attending for the unit, Dr. Allard, came by a few\ntimes to assess your father&rsquo;s condition, telling you and your mother\nthat they were closely monitoring him at all hours. You even had the\nlady balls to straight-up ask him what was wrong with your father,\nand what had happened to cause these broken bones and charred skin,\nbut he just sighed painfully and gave you a look; a look that said,\n\u201c<i>you know that I can&rsquo;t tell you that</i>\u201d.</p><p>The\nfollowing day was tough one. You couldn&rsquo;t afford to miss any more\nschool; after all, you were already playing catch-up. As much as you\ndidn&rsquo;t want to leave your father&rsquo;s bedside, it was clear that you had\nno choice in the matter. You finally stopped arguing with your mom\nwhen she assured you that she would call the school if there was <i>any</i>\nchange in your dad&rsquo;s condition, for better or worse.</p><p>You\nchanged into the clothes she had packed for you before she picked you\nup from school, already knowing that you&rsquo;d refuse to leave your\nfather&rsquo;s side for something as trivial as clean clothes. You sighed a\nlittle guiltily, thanking her for being so thoughtful. You don&rsquo;t know\nhow she did it \u2013 you were barely functioning and you didn&rsquo;t have to\nworry about clothing or transporting or feeding a child on top of it\nall.</p><p>She\nhugged you tightly and whispered encouraging words in your ear before\nshe released you to the guard. You swung your backpack over your\nshoulder as you boarded the elevator with Tall, Dark, and Scary.</p><p>\u201cYou\nwon&rsquo;t tell me shit either, will you?\u201d you broke the silence as the\ndouble doors closed. You could slice the tension in the small space\nwith a butter knife, but in your angry and sleep-deprived state, you\nreally didn&rsquo;t care. Your father was severely injured and <i>someone</i>\nwas gonna answer for it.</p><p>The\nbig guy exhaled sharply through his nose but didn&rsquo;t look at you or\neven turn his head in your direction.</p><p>\u201cOh,\nso it&rsquo;s gonna be like that, huh?\u201d you challenged, nodding your head\nbitterly. \u201cI see how it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour\ndad&rsquo;s safe. That&rsquo;s all you need to know for now,\u201d he said.</p><p>You\nscoffed. \u201c<i>That&rsquo;s all I need to know for now?</i>\nReally?! My dad has had this job for less than a week and he&rsquo;s laid\nup in a hospital bed, comatose, covered in burns and\u2014and casts\nand\u2014<i>what the hell happened to him</i>?\nWhy won&rsquo;t anyone tell us anything? We deserve to know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour\ndad knew what he was signing up for when he took this job,\u201d the man\ngrowled, pointing a large finger in your face. You bit your tongue to\nkeep from slapping it away. \u201cIt&rsquo;s not pretty, and you&rsquo;re in the\ndark, and you&rsquo;re pissed. I get it. But there&rsquo;s a <i>reason</i>\nyou don&rsquo;t know more right now, and <i>trust me</i>\nwhen I say that it&rsquo;s a damn good one!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\n<i>seriously</i> doubt when\nhe signed the dotted line that having over half of his body burned\nwithin the month was on his mind,\u201d you seethed, venom in every last\nsyllable. \u201cThis is complete bullshit!\u201d</p><p>Patience\nand empathy was clearly not one of this man&rsquo;s strong suits as he\npursed his lips and clenched his fists; you even heard a knuckle pop.\nHe didn&rsquo;t say a word as the elevator doors opened and he strutted\ndown the hall, leaving you fuming behind him.</p><p>The\ncar ride was full of silent tension and searing stares. It was at\nmoments like this when you wished you were born with super powers, or\nwere a technical genius, so that you could get the kind of\ninformation you wanted. Holding a giant plasma canon in the guy&rsquo;s\nface or shooting lasers at him with your eyes would definitely loosen\nhis lips. For now, you&rsquo;d just have to settle with death glares in the\nrear view mirror. If he noticed, he didn&rsquo;t show it. Those stupid\nsunglasses made it impossible to tell, anyway.</p><p>As\nhe pulled up behind the bus lane, you exited the SUV as soon as you\npossibly could. He yelled something to you but you slammed the door\nin his face, giving you a faint sense of satisfaction. <i>That&rsquo;ll\nshow him</i>.</p><p>To\nyour shock, Ned and Peter were power-walking toward you. The moment\nthey&rsquo;d spotted you exiting the noticeable black vehicle in the sea of\nyellow buses, they weaved through the crowd of high school students.\nYou&rsquo;d only known the guys for a few days and they were approaching\nyou with such concern in their eyes that you didn&rsquo;t know what to\nthink.</p><p>\u201cHey,\nY/N!\u201d Ned yelled as he came closer, waving as if you couldn&rsquo;t see\nthem in the crowd. \u201cY/N!\u201d</p><p>You\ncouldn&rsquo;t help but smile slightly, shaking your head. Ned had a\npainstakingly clueless air about him sometimes.</p><p>\u201cHey,\nguys,\u201d you sighed as they stopped in front of you. You tried to\ngrin but the effort made your face hurt so you quickly abandoned the\nidea.</p><p>\u201cAre\nyou okay? What happened?\u201d Peter asked, such genuine concern in his\nbrown eyes and endless kindness in his voice. You felt your shoulders\nrelax.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\nwhat happened? You look <i>aw</i>ful,\u201d\nNed said. \n</p><p>You\nglared and raised your hands questioningly. Peter&rsquo;s head turned\ntoward Ned slowly, his expression incredulous. \n</p><p>\u201cGee,\nthanks, Ned,\u201d you scowled.</p><p>The\nreality of what he&rsquo;d said seemed to set in on him, and Ned&rsquo;s mouth\nformed an 'O&rsquo;. \n</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\ndidn&rsquo;t mean that you don&rsquo;t look good,\u201d Ned said quickly. \u201cI mean,\nyou&rsquo;re like the hottest girl in school right now anyway, right,\nPeter?\u201d</p><p>Your\nstare morphed from a glare to confusion, and you looked to Peter. He\nsuddenly seemed intensely uncomfortable. Ned looked at Peter for\nsupport, raising his eyebrows, begging for his friend to help him out\nof the hole he&rsquo;d dug.</p><p>\u201cUh,\nI mean, you\u2014you always look g-good&hellip; great,\u201d Peter gulped,\nglaring at Ned and meeting your eyes anxiously.</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d\nNed added enthusiastically, nodding at you over Peter&rsquo;s shoulder.</p><p>You\nhuffed out a weak laugh. Ned looked relieved and Peter looked like he\nwanted to melt into a puddle. \u201cNice save, guys.\u201d</p><p>The\nbell rang and you turned toward the front doors, following the large\ncrowd of your classmates. You assumed that Ned and Peter were right\nbehind you, but when you turned to talk to them, you discovered that\nthey were a few feet back, Peter whispering furiously at Ned. You\ngrinned to yourself, thinking of Peter&rsquo;s flustered compliments. A\nsingle butterfly flapped its wings inside your stomach, and you\nsavored the feeling\u2014something other than fury and hopelessness was\na refreshing and welcome change.</p><p>The\nwolf whistles that followed you down the hallway that morning went in\none ear and out the other. Your mind was floating through the\nhospital and into the room with your father. Your hands shook as you\nopened your locker, unable to twist the correct combination until\nyour third try. Before the lock finally gave, you were about to start\ncrying.</p><p>\u201cHey,\ndo you need any help with your books?\u201d came a soft voice beside\nyou, and the frustrated tears threatening to spill retreated at the\nsound.</p><p>\u201cNo,\nit&rsquo;s okay, Peter,\u201d you said, stuffing two binders into your\nbackpack and putting three books into your locker. \u201cI&rsquo;m just a\nlittle&hellip; distracted, is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nget it,\u201d he said, swinging his backpack over one shoulder. \u201cIf\u2014if\nyou want to talk about it, I&rsquo;ve been told I&rsquo;m a good listener. Me and\nNed. We&rsquo;re good listeners.\u201d</p><p>You\nsmiled but it didn&rsquo;t reach your eyes, an all-too-familiar ache\nreturning to the middle of your throat.</p><p>\u201cUm,\nmaybe at lunch. It&rsquo;s kind of a long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d\nPeter nodded, eager to accommodate. You turned to walk toward\nhomeroom and Peter stayed by your side, talking about the next\nmachine that he and Ned were building for their class later in the\nday. It was obvious that he was doing his best to make conversation\nand keep your mind off of whatever was bothering you, and you were\nthankful. As far as you could tell, Peter was a total saint.</p><p>He\nstopped at the classroom door, suddenly self-conscious. He reached to\nscratch at the back of his neck, and the movement caught your eye. \n</p><p>\u201cSorry,\nyou probably don&rsquo;t even care about robotics,\u201d he apologized, almost\nembarrassed.</p><p>\u201cNo\nit&rsquo;s okay\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost\npeople don&rsquo;t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\nPeter, anything you say is a thousand times better than what&rsquo;s going\non in my head right now,\u201d you smiled, touched. It did reach your\neyes this time, and your throat ached for a different reason. You\nlightly brushed his arm before hooking your thumbs back under you\nbackpack straps. \n</p><p>Peter Parker could read the phone book to you and you&rsquo;d listen with\nrapt attention.</p><p>He\nglanced at his forearm where you&rsquo;d touched him, and then up to your\neyes. They were so chocolate. There was a mix of relief and something\nelse swimming in them, and whatever the something else was, it added\na butterfly or two to the dancing colony in your stomach.</p><p>Peter\nseemed to catch himself. He pointed behind him. \u201cI\u2014I need to go.\nI&rsquo;ve already been late to English twice this week.\u201d</p><p>You\ngrinned. Now that you thought about it, Peter was almost late\nwherever he went.</p><p>\u201cSee\nyou at lunch, Parker.\u201d The corner of your lips pulled up.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nhe nodded, backing away but still facing you, \u201cyeah. Okay, bye.\u201d</p><p>Your\nhands didn&rsquo;t leave your backpack straps but you stretched out your\nfingers and wiggled them as a farewell. He smiled\u2014then proceeded to\nback into someone and almost make them drop their books.</p><p>You\nsnorted to yourself as he exclaimed \u201cSorry!\u201d at the unsuspecting guy\nand sprinted away down the hall.</p><p>Ned\nmade small talk with you in homeroom, and you could tell that he was\ndoing his best to distract you just like Peter was. There must&rsquo;ve\nbeen something about your face that revealed the turmoil tossing and\nturning beneath.</p><hr><p>Lunch\nwas a blessing. By the time the bell rang and freed you, the\nfrustration and need to vent were so strong that you were about to\nburst. Ned and Peter were smart guys and longtime New-Yorkers with\nplenty of experience in the alien invasion department. Surely they&rsquo;d\nhave <i>some</i> idea of what\nwas going on.</p><p>You\nwere the last to sit down at what had become your friend group&rsquo;s\ndesignated table. Ned and Peter were in a deep discussion that cut\noff the second you were within earshot. You tried not to be bothered\nby the fact that they always seemed to be changing subjects around\nyou\u2014after all, they&rsquo;d been best friends for years and they barely\nknew you. But it bugged you nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cSo,\nyou promised us a juicy story at lunch today,\u201d Ned reminded you,\ntone light and teasing. You&rsquo;d much rather his nonchalant approach\nthan anyone treating you like a cracking china doll. \n</p><p>You\nsighed and picked up your plastic fork, prodding what was supposed to\nbe spaghetti on your plate. With your stay in the hospital, packing\nlunch hadn&rsquo;t been an option.</p><p>\u201cWhere\ndo I even start?\u201d you exhaled, dropping the fork and pushing the\nplate away. You&rsquo;d suddenly lost your appetite, not that you had much\nof one in the first place. \u201cWith the bulletproof SUV? Or what about\nthe bodyguard that constantly has a stick shoved up his ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d\nPeter asked, clearly confused.</p><p>You\nrubbed your eyes and colorful stars appeared in the corners of your\nvision. \u201cIt&rsquo;s my dad. There was some kind of accident at his office\nand he&rsquo;s in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\nthat sucks,\u201d Ned breathed. \u201cI&rsquo;m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\nhappened?\u201d Peter asked, his brows pulled together.</p><p>\u201cI\ndon&rsquo;t even know,\u201d you chuckled hopelessly. \u201cThey won&rsquo;t tell us\nanything. All the doctor will say is, 'we&rsquo;re keeping an eye on him&rsquo;.\nEvery time I ask someone a question I get looked at like I&rsquo;m about to\nhave a nervous breakdown or get shot, one of the two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N&hellip;\nwhat exactly does your dad <i>do</i>?\u201d\nPeter inquired, leaning forward slightly.</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s\na government job,\u201d you explained. \u201cI think the official term for\nhis division is Alien Affairs or something. I don&rsquo;t even know what he\ndoes. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m supposed to.\u201d</p><p>Something\nin Peter&rsquo;s body language changed. Ned&rsquo;s eyes snapped to him before\nlanding back on you.</p><p>\u201cThe\nbodyguard makes sense then&hellip;\u201d Ned muttered, almost to himself.</p><p>\u201cAnd\nget this,\u201d you continued, the weight of holding all of your\nfrustrations inside beginning to lift, \u201cthe place is like a prison.\nNo one goes in or out without armed supervision, even family. And the\nfloors above and below where government employees are kept are empty,\nfor 'security reasons&rsquo;, they said. What the hell does that even\nmean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\nwould they be guarding a hospital if there was just an 'accident&rsquo;?\u201d\nNed wondered.</p><p>\u201cBecause\nit probably wasn&rsquo;t an accident,\u201d Peter replied, looking at one\nspot on the table. You could practically hear the whir of wheels\nturning inside of his brain.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014what\ndo you mean it wasn&rsquo;t an accident?\u201d you blanched, trying to catch\nhis eye, but his were still glued to the table.</p><p>He\nfinally met your prodding gaze and suddenly seemed a little nervous,\nlike he had a time limit to get all of the words out. \u201cI mean,\ny-you know, Mr. Stark deals with the government all the time. He says\nthey lie more than they tell the truth. Everything is, uh, always\ncovered up until they&rsquo;re sure they aren&rsquo;t liable for anything.\u201d</p><p>You\nshrugged and rolled your eyes at the accuracy. \u201cSounds about\nright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid\nthey at least mention when he&rsquo;d be released?\u201d Ned asked.</p><p>You\nshook your head and looked at your lap, fighting back the stinging at\nthe corner of your eyes. \u201cNo. But it won&rsquo;t be anytime soon. You\nshould&rsquo;ve seen him&hellip; he looks <i>burned</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo\nyou think there was a fire or something?\u201d Ned asked.</p><p>\u201cOr\nmaybe it&rsquo;s chemical burns. I don&rsquo;t know,\u201d you sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s the not knowing that\u2019s the worst.\u201d</p><p>Peter\nhad gone quiet, and you found yourself biting the inside of your\ncheek. Was he awkward around talk of grief? Maybe he was\nuncomfortable. But no, something told you, he&rsquo;s thinking. Thinking\nhard.</p><p>\u201cWhat\nis it, Peter?\u201d you asked, your voice a mixture of hope and caution.\nWhat if he said something that you didn&rsquo;t want to hear?</p><p>He\nsuddenly bolted out of his seat, his chair tumbling to the floor with\na loud clatter. He was grabbing his things and stuffing them into his\nbackpack. His mind was obviously somewhere that wasn&rsquo;t the cafeteria.\n\n</p><p>He\nwas leaving. Again.</p><p>\u201cDude,\nwhere are you going?\u201d Ned questioned, but whether it was for his\nbenefit or yours, you didn&rsquo;t know.</p><p>Peter\nwas backing away, making to run, looking right at you. \u201cIt&rsquo;s Mr.\nStark, I forgot about\u2014about that thing. Cover for me in Chemistry,\nY/N?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2014\u201d</p><p>But\nhe was gone in a flash of chocolate hair and a bouncing backpack.</p><p><b><a href=\"http://loveissupernatural.tumblr.com/post/182566498426/the-man-behind-the-mask-pt-5-peter-parker-x\">Pt 5</a></b></p><p><i>Tag list: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7JRWR0UsFFNV0WacyZ67cA\">@rivaea</a> @silver-rayne\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCsTu6FsfTG4Aoim29jxhzQ\">@starksparker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGJyhqs40hOjMQ4mU5IIsMA\">@jeli-jelly</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA8p97H4gTfIip11A_GoTZw\">@its-nikki-bitch</a></i></p>",

You followed his lead in a blur.\nThe hospital wing was deserted, all the doors down the blindingly\nwhite hallway ajar, allowing you to peer into the rooms. Every bed\nwas perfectly made, a fresh vase of flowers by every window. It was\nalmost eerie.</p><p>\u201cFor security\nreasons,\u201d came a deep voice through the haze. You looked into the\ndark sunglasses that looked back at you before they turned away. \u201cNo\none underneath or above the floor our people are on. We don\u2019t want\nanyone here that shouldn\u2019t be, and it\u2019s a hell of a lot easier to\nspot someone who doesn\u2019t belong when no one should be in this hallway\nin the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely \u2013 I\nmean, but patients were here, right?\u201d you stuttered. \u201cWhere did\nthey go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomewhere else,\u201d\nhe replied shortly, making it clear that the conversation was over.\nYou glanced back at your mother, who shrugged and gave you a look\nthat clearly said \u201c<i>stop asking questions</i>\u201d.</p><p>The three of you\napproached an elevator at the end of the off-putting corridor. There\nwasn\u2019t an up or down button, but a keypad and a finger print scanner.\nYour brows furrowed. Why in the hell was this place like a disguised\nprison instead of a hospital? Who\u2014or <i>what</i>\u2014was your father\nbeing protected from? A shiver ran down your spine.</p><p>The large man\nobscured your view with his shoulder blades, leaning down to punch in a\ncombination and scan his fingerprint. It was clear that you weren\u2019t\nsupposed to know how to get into this elevator without supervision.\nBut this was your <i>dad\u2014</i>he\ndidn\u2019t need protecting from you, from his family.</p><p>A\nloud alarm sounded throughout the hallway as the elevator arrived.\nYou were sure that everyone in the hospital could hear it, and maybe\nthat was the point\u2014no surprise visitors. The blaring ceased as the\ndoors opened and the three of you stepped inside. It was stainless\nsteel and spotless, sterile, like everything else around you.\nYou weren\u2019t sure if this was comforting you, or the opposite. It was\nclean, but there was no warmth.</p><p>The\nelevator did not have any indicator or screen that told you what\nfloor you were arriving to. You gulped as the doors finally parted\nfor you, a hallway even more blindingly white meeting your vision,\nbut this time it was full of people bustling around, all seemingly in\na hurry. Nurses were in protective suits, masks covering their faces,\nas they entered a room at the very end of the hallway with a large\ncaution indicator flashing above it. You couldn\u2019t believe what you\nwere seeing. It was like a scene from a science fiction movie.</p><p>\u201cYour\nfather isn\u2019t in there,\u201d a deep voice said, pulling you from your\nthoughts. Was that meant to be comforting? You looked up at his stony\nface, his lense-covered eyes betraying nothing. He simply motioned to\nhis right, down a separate hallway. You followed the\nbodyguard/driver/assassin/whatever-the-hell-he-was down the corridor,\nyour mother\u2019s hand raising to squeeze your shoulder again. He stopped\nat a door to his right and stepped to the side, his back against the\ndoor frame and clasping his fists in front of him, like a guard. He\nlooked at you and nodded toward the room, but then faced forward and\ngave no indication after that acknowledging your existence.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll\nbe alright, honey,\u201d your mother whispered into your ear as you\nslowly stepped into the room, hands balled into fists at your sides.\nWould your father be awake, be responsive? Would he be covered in\ncasts and bandages to the point of being unrecognizable? Would he be\nhooked up to machines with an endless array of wires? Would he be\n<i>okay</i>?</p><p>Your\nfather\u2019s bed came into view, but he was blocked by a team of nurses,\nchecking a few machines and muttering to each other in hushed tones.\nThe four women buzzing around his bed like bees around a hive made\nyour stomach churn.</p><p>\u201cOh,\nthe family\u2019s here,\u201d one announced, stepping back and sending you a\nsmall smile. The others looked up and quickly finished up whatever\nthey were doing. You still couldn\u2019t see him.</p><p>\u201cIs\nhe okay?\u201d you asked, not recognizing the weak voice that came out\nof your mouth. \u201cWhat happened? Why\u2014why does he need all of these\nmachines? What\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re\nkeeping an eye on him,\u201d answered the nurse, resting two of her\nhands on your shoulders as if to anchor you down. She smiled but her\neyes betrayed nothing, just like your security guard by the door. It\nwas then that you realized everyone here was the same: they\u2019d tell\nyou the bare minimum to keep whatever the hell happened at your dad\u2019s\nplace of work under wraps.</p><p>Frustration\nburned in your veins like hot coals, and your face must\u2019ve shown it,\nbecause her hands hastily left your shoulders and the nurses\nretreated from the room, taking every trace of paperwork with them.</p><p>And then you saw him.</p><p>He\nwas a pitiful sight, a bundle of bandages and blankets. Half of his\nface was obscured by gauze which had freshly been changed, his\nvisible eye swollen shut. He had a large chunk of hair missing from\nthe right side of his scalp, more gauze and wrappings covering the\narea. If you didn\u2019t know better, you\u2019d say he looked\u2026 <i>burned</i>.</p><p>You\nsucked in a deep, trembling breath at the sight of him, reaching to\nhold his hand but finding that it was covered in a bulky cast. Your\nthroat ached, tears rushing down your face despite your effort to\nkeep them walled back. \n</p><p><i>What happened?</i></p><p>Your mother sat at a\nchair on the other side of his bed, hands clasped over her mouth as\nif it would hold back the gasping sobs escaping her. The sound did\nnothing to strengthen your resolve.</p><p>\u201c<i>Daddy</i>\u2026\u201d\nyou whispered, softly touching the unblistered fingertips protruding\nfrom his cast. His bandaged face swam in your vision as more tears\nbetrayed you, making the room a blur of bright white light and\nswimming shapes.</p><p>As\nyour mother\u2019s cries echoed throughout the room, mixing with yours in\na chorus of heart-wrenching wails, you collapsed to your knees,\nholding onto your father\u2019s unresponsive fingertips like they\u2019d keep\nyou from drowning in a sea of your own tears.</p><p>In\nthat moment, as you felt yourself slip into a void, and saw your rock\nof a mother look more defeated than you\u2019d ever thought possible, you\ndecided something.</p><p>You\u2019d\nfind out what happened to your father. \n</p><p>No\nmatter what it took.</p><hr><p>You\nmissed school the next day, refusing to leave your dad\u2019s side. You\ndidn\u2019t eat, you didn\u2019t sleep, you didn\u2019t even go to the bathroom\nunless you absolutely couldn\u2019t hold it anymore, afraid you\u2019d miss\nsomething. The attending for the unit, Dr. Allard, came by a few\ntimes to assess your father\u2019s condition, telling you and your mother\nthat they were closely monitoring him at all hours. You even had the\nlady balls to straight-up ask him what was wrong with your father,\nand what had happened to cause these broken bones and charred skin,\nbut he just sighed painfully and gave you a look; a look that said,\n\u201c<i>you know that I can\u2019t tell you that</i>\u201d.</p><p>The\nfollowing day was tough one. You couldn\u2019t afford to miss any more\nschool; after all, you were already playing catch-up. As much as you\ndidn\u2019t want to leave your father\u2019s bedside, it was clear that you had\nno choice in the matter. You finally stopped arguing with your mom\nwhen she assured you that she would call the school if there was <i>any</i>\nchange in your dad\u2019s condition, for better or worse.</p><p>You\nchanged into the clothes she had packed for you before she picked you\nup from school, already knowing that you\u2019d refuse to leave your\nfather\u2019s side for something as trivial as clean clothes. You sighed a\nlittle guiltily, thanking her for being so thoughtful. You don\u2019t know\nhow she did it \u2013 you were barely functioning and you didn\u2019t have to\nworry about clothing or transporting or feeding a child on top of it\nall.</p><p>She\nhugged you tightly and whispered encouraging words in your ear before\nshe released you to the guard. You swung your backpack over your\nshoulder as you boarded the elevator with Tall, Dark, and Scary.</p><p>\u201cYou\nwon\u2019t tell me shit either, will you?\u201d you broke the silence as the\ndouble doors closed. You could slice the tension in the small space\nwith a butter knife, but in your angry and sleep-deprived state, you\nreally didn\u2019t care. Your father was severely injured and <i>someone</i>\nwas gonna answer for it.</p><p>The\nbig guy exhaled sharply through his nose but didn\u2019t look at you or\neven turn his head in your direction.</p><p>\u201cOh,\nso it\u2019s gonna be like that, huh?\u201d you challenged, nodding your head\nbitterly. \u201cI see how it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour\ndad\u2019s safe. That\u2019s all you need to know for now,\u201d he said.</p><p>You\nscoffed. \u201c<i>That\u2019s all I need to know for now?</i>\nReally?! My dad has had this job for less than a week and he\u2019s laid\nup in a hospital bed, comatose, covered in burns and\u2014and casts\nand\u2014<i>what the hell happened to him</i>?\nWhy won\u2019t anyone tell us anything? We deserve to know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour\ndad knew what he was signing up for when he took this job,\u201d the man\ngrowled, pointing a large finger in your face. You bit your tongue to\nkeep from slapping it away. \u201cIt\u2019s not pretty, and you\u2019re in the\ndark, and you\u2019re pissed. I get it. But there\u2019s a <i>reason</i>\nyou don\u2019t know more right now, and <i>trust me</i>\nwhen I say that it\u2019s a damn good one!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\n<i>seriously</i> doubt when\nhe signed the dotted line that having over half of his body burned\nwithin the month was on his mind,\u201d you seethed, venom in every last\nsyllable. \u201cThis is complete bullshit!\u201d</p><p>Patience\nand empathy was clearly not one of this man\u2019s strong suits as he\npursed his lips and clenched his fists; you even heard a knuckle pop.\nHe didn\u2019t say a word as the elevator doors opened and he strutted\ndown the hall, leaving you fuming behind him.</p><p>The\ncar ride was full of silent tension and searing stares. It was at\nmoments like this when you wished you were born with super powers, or\nwere a technical genius, so that you could get the kind of\ninformation you wanted. Holding a giant plasma canon in the guy\u2019s\nface or shooting lasers at him with your eyes would definitely loosen\nhis lips. For now, you\u2019d just have to settle with death glares in the\nrear view mirror. If he noticed, he didn\u2019t show it. Those stupid\nsunglasses made it impossible to tell, anyway.</p><p>As\nhe pulled up behind the bus lane, you exited the SUV as soon as you\npossibly could. He yelled something to you but you slammed the door\nin his face, giving you a faint sense of satisfaction. <i>That\u2019ll\nshow him</i>.</p><p>To\nyour shock, Ned and Peter were power-walking toward you. The moment\nthey\u2019d spotted you exiting the noticeable black vehicle in the sea of\nyellow buses, they weaved through the crowd of high school students.\nYou\u2019d only known the guys for a few days and they were approaching\nyou with such concern in their eyes that you didn\u2019t know what to\nthink.</p><p>\u201cHey,\nY/N!\u201d Ned yelled as he came closer, waving as if you couldn\u2019t see\nthem in the crowd. \u201cY/N!\u201d</p><p>You\ncouldn\u2019t help but smile slightly, shaking your head. Ned had a\npainstakingly clueless air about him sometimes.</p><p>\u201cHey,\nguys,\u201d you sighed as they stopped in front of you. You tried to\ngrin but the effort made your face hurt so you quickly abandoned the\nidea.</p><p>\u201cAre\nyou okay? What happened?\u201d Peter asked, such genuine concern in his\nbrown eyes and endless kindness in his voice. You felt your shoulders\nrelax.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\nwhat happened? You look <i>aw</i>ful,\u201d\nNed said. \n</p><p>You\nglared and raised your hands questioningly. Peter\u2019s head turned\ntoward Ned slowly, his expression incredulous. \n</p><p>\u201cGee,\nthanks, Ned,\u201d you scowled.</p><p>The\nreality of what he\u2019d said seemed to set in on him, and Ned\u2019s mouth\nformed an 'O\u2019. \n</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\ndidn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t look good,\u201d Ned said quickly. \u201cI mean,\nyou\u2019re like the hottest girl in school right now anyway, right,\nPeter?\u201d</p><p>Your\nstare morphed from a glare to confusion, and you looked to Peter. He\nsuddenly seemed intensely uncomfortable. Ned looked at Peter for\nsupport, raising his eyebrows, begging for his friend to help him out\nof the hole he\u2019d dug.</p><p>\u201cUh,\nI mean, you\u2014you always look g-good\u2026 great,\u201d Peter gulped,\nglaring at Ned and meeting your eyes anxiously.</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d\nNed added enthusiastically, nodding at you over Peter\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>You\nhuffed out a weak laugh. Ned looked relieved and Peter looked like he\nwanted to melt into a puddle. \u201cNice save, guys.\u201d</p><p>The\nbell rang and you turned toward the front doors, following the large\ncrowd of your classmates. You assumed that Ned and Peter were right\nbehind you, but when you turned to talk to them, you discovered that\nthey were a few feet back, Peter whispering furiously at Ned. You\ngrinned to yourself, thinking of Peter\u2019s flustered compliments. A\nsingle butterfly flapped its wings inside your stomach, and you\nsavored the feeling\u2014something other than fury and hopelessness was\na refreshing and welcome change.</p><p>The\nwolf whistles that followed you down the hallway that morning went in\none ear and out the other. Your mind was floating through the\nhospital and into the room with your father. Your hands shook as you\nopened your locker, unable to twist the correct combination until\nyour third try. Before the lock finally gave, you were about to start\ncrying.</p><p>\u201cHey,\ndo you need any help with your books?\u201d came a soft voice beside\nyou, and the frustrated tears threatening to spill retreated at the\nsound.</p><p>\u201cNo,\nit\u2019s okay, Peter,\u201d you said, stuffing two binders into your\nbackpack and putting three books into your locker. \u201cI\u2019m just a\nlittle\u2026 distracted, is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nget it,\u201d he said, swinging his backpack over one shoulder. \u201cIf\u2014if\nyou want to talk about it, I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m a good listener. Me and\nNed. We\u2019re good listeners.\u201d</p><p>You\nsmiled but it didn\u2019t reach your eyes, an all-too-familiar ache\nreturning to the middle of your throat.</p><p>\u201cUm,\nmaybe at lunch. It\u2019s kind of a long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d\nPeter nodded, eager to accommodate. You turned to walk toward\nhomeroom and Peter stayed by your side, talking about the next\nmachine that he and Ned were building for their class later in the\nday. It was obvious that he was doing his best to make conversation\nand keep your mind off of whatever was bothering you, and you were\nthankful. As far as you could tell, Peter was a total saint.</p><p>He\nstopped at the classroom door, suddenly self-conscious. He reached to\nscratch at the back of his neck, and the movement caught your eye. \n</p><p>\u201cSorry,\nyou probably don\u2019t even care about robotics,\u201d he apologized, almost\nembarrassed.</p><p>\u201cNo\nit\u2019s okay\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost\npeople don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\nPeter, anything you say is a thousand times better than what\u2019s going\non in my head right now,\u201d you smiled, touched. It did reach your\neyes this time, and your throat ached for a different reason. You\nlightly brushed his arm before hooking your thumbs back under you\nbackpack straps. \n</p><p>Peter Parker could read the phone book to you and you\u2019d listen with\nrapt attention.</p><p>He\nglanced at his forearm where you\u2019d touched him, and then up to your\neyes. They were so chocolate. There was a mix of relief and something\nelse swimming in them, and whatever the something else was, it added\na butterfly or two to the dancing colony in your stomach.</p><p>Peter\nseemed to catch himself. He pointed behind him. \u201cI\u2014I need to go.\nI\u2019ve already been late to English twice this week.\u201d</p><p>You\ngrinned. Now that you thought about it, Peter was almost late\nwherever he went.</p><p>\u201cSee\nyou at lunch, Parker.\u201d The corner of your lips pulled up.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nhe nodded, backing away but still facing you, \u201cyeah. Okay, bye.\u201d</p><p>Your\nhands didn\u2019t leave your backpack straps but you stretched out your\nfingers and wiggled them as a farewell. He smiled\u2014then proceeded to\nback into someone and almost make them drop their books.</p><p>You\nsnorted to yourself as he exclaimed \u201cSorry!\u201d at the unsuspecting guy\nand sprinted away down the hall.</p><p>Ned\nmade small talk with you in homeroom, and you could tell that he was\ndoing his best to distract you just like Peter was. There must\u2019ve\nbeen something about your face that revealed the turmoil tossing and\nturning beneath.</p><hr><p>Lunch\nwas a blessing. By the time the bell rang and freed you, the\nfrustration and need to vent were so strong that you were about to\nburst. Ned and Peter were smart guys and longtime New-Yorkers with\nplenty of experience in the alien invasion department. Surely they\u2019d\nhave <i>some</i> idea of what\nwas going on.</p><p>You\nwere the last to sit down at what had become your friend group\u2019s\ndesignated table. Ned and Peter were in a deep discussion that cut\noff the second you were within earshot. You tried not to be bothered\nby the fact that they always seemed to be changing subjects around\nyou\u2014after all, they\u2019d been best friends for years and they barely\nknew you. But it bugged you nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cSo,\nyou promised us a juicy story at lunch today,\u201d Ned reminded you,\ntone light and teasing. You\u2019d much rather his nonchalant approach\nthan anyone treating you like a cracking china doll. \n</p><p>You\nsighed and picked up your plastic fork, prodding what was supposed to\nbe spaghetti on your plate. With your stay in the hospital, packing\nlunch hadn\u2019t been an option.</p><p>\u201cWhere\ndo I even start?\u201d you exhaled, dropping the fork and pushing the\nplate away. You\u2019d suddenly lost your appetite, not that you had much\nof one in the first place. \u201cWith the bulletproof SUV? Or what about\nthe bodyguard that constantly has a stick shoved up his ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d\nPeter asked, clearly confused.</p><p>You\nrubbed your eyes and colorful stars appeared in the corners of your\nvision. \u201cIt\u2019s my dad. There was some kind of accident at his office\nand he\u2019s in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\nthat sucks,\u201d Ned breathed. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\nhappened?\u201d Peter asked, his brows pulled together.</p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t even know,\u201d you chuckled hopelessly. \u201cThey won\u2019t tell us\nanything. All the doctor will say is, 'we\u2019re keeping an eye on him\u2019.\nEvery time I ask someone a question I get looked at like I\u2019m about to\nhave a nervous breakdown or get shot, one of the two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N\u2026\nwhat exactly does your dad <i>do</i>?\u201d\nPeter inquired, leaning forward slightly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\na government job,\u201d you explained. \u201cI think the official term for\nhis division is Alien Affairs or something. I don\u2019t even know what he\ndoes. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m supposed to.\u201d</p><p>Something\nin Peter\u2019s body language changed. Ned\u2019s eyes snapped to him before\nlanding back on you.</p><p>\u201cThe\nbodyguard makes sense then\u2026\u201d Ned muttered, almost to himself.</p><p>\u201cAnd\nget this,\u201d you continued, the weight of holding all of your\nfrustrations inside beginning to lift, \u201cthe place is like a prison.\nNo one goes in or out without armed supervision, even family. And the\nfloors above and below where government employees are kept are empty,\nfor 'security reasons\u2019, they said. What the hell does that even\nmean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\nwould they be guarding a hospital if there was just an 'accident\u2019?\u201d\nNed wondered.</p><p>\u201cBecause\nit probably wasn\u2019t an accident,\u201d Peter replied, looking at one\nspot on the table. You could practically hear the whir of wheels\nturning inside of his brain.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014what\ndo you mean it wasn\u2019t an accident?\u201d you blanched, trying to catch\nhis eye, but his were still glued to the table.</p><p>He\nfinally met your prodding gaze and suddenly seemed a little nervous,\nlike he had a time limit to get all of the words out. \u201cI mean,\ny-you know, Mr. Stark deals with the government all the time. He says\nthey lie more than they tell the truth. Everything is, uh, always\ncovered up until they\u2019re sure they aren\u2019t liable for anything.\u201d</p><p>You\nshrugged and rolled your eyes at the accuracy. \u201cSounds about\nright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid\nthey at least mention when he\u2019d be released?\u201d Ned asked.</p><p>You\nshook your head and looked at your lap, fighting back the stinging at\nthe corner of your eyes. \u201cNo. But it won\u2019t be anytime soon. You\nshould\u2019ve seen him\u2026 he looks <i>burned</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo\nyou think there was a fire or something?\u201d Ned asked.</p><p>\u201cOr\nmaybe it\u2019s chemical burns. I don\u2019t know,\u201d you sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s the not knowing that\u2019s the worst.\u201d</p><p>Peter\nhad gone quiet, and you found yourself biting the inside of your\ncheek. Was he awkward around talk of grief? Maybe he was\nuncomfortable. But no, something told you, he\u2019s thinking. Thinking\nhard.</p><p>\u201cWhat\nis it, Peter?\u201d you asked, your voice a mixture of hope and caution.\nWhat if he said something that you didn\u2019t want to hear?</p><p>He\nsuddenly bolted out of his seat, his chair tumbling to the floor with\na loud clatter. He was grabbing his things and stuffing them into his\nbackpack. His mind was obviously somewhere that wasn\u2019t the cafeteria.\n\n</p><p>He\nwas leaving. Again.</p><p>\u201cDude,\nwhere are you going?\u201d Ned questioned, but whether it was for his\nbenefit or yours, you didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Peter\nwas backing away, making to run, looking right at you. \u201cIt\u2019s Mr.\nStark, I forgot about\u2014about that thing. Cover for me in Chemistry,\nY/N?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2014\u201d</p><p>But\nhe was gone in a flash of chocolate hair and a bouncing backpack.</p><p><b><a href=\"http://loveissupernatural.tumblr.com/post/182566498426/the-man-behind-the-mask-pt-5-peter-parker-x\">Pt 5</a></b></p><p><i>Tag list: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7JRWR0UsFFNV0WacyZ67cA\">@rivaea</a> @silver-rayne\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCsTu6FsfTG4Aoim29jxhzQ\">@starksparker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGJyhqs40hOjMQ4mU5IIsMA\">@jeli-jelly</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA8p97H4gTfIip11A_GoTZw\">@its-nikki-bitch</a></i></p></p>",

The black car your mother had taken to\nthe school was a company car \u2013 a government car. With a driver. It\nall seemed so cold and official. Your mom was crying beside you in\nthe backseat but unsuccessfully trying to hide it, for your sake. She\ntried to explain through her sobs what happened at your father\u2019s\nworkplace, but it seemed that she didn\u2019t really know many details at\nall. Everything government-related was secretive, especially when it\nconcerned alien affairs, and <i>especially </i>when\nthe word \u2018accident\u2019 was thrown around. You were sure that they were\nkeeping you and your mother in the dark about what happened \u2013 you\u2019d\nbet money that they always knew more than they were saying.</p><p>The man in the suit\nand sunglasses behind the wheel never said a word and his facial\nexpression never changed throughout the drive to the hospital. He\nseemed entirely uninviting. You noticed a bulge at his side\nunderneath his suit jacket, and it didn\u2019t take more than a moment to\nrealize that it was a gun. Of course it was. What was he,\nsecurity detail? To keep you and your mother safe or to maybe keep\nyou two from probing more than you should be into the incident?\nEither way, you found his presence completely unnecessary and a bit\nunnerving.</p><p>Pulling up to the\nhospital, you threw open the SUV door before the vehicle was\ncompletely stopped and ran toward the doors despite your mother\u2019s\nprotests. The lobby was cold and sterile, bringing chill bumps to\nyour arms. Your sense of foreboding only heightened.</p><p>\u201cBaby, don\u2019t go\nrunning off like that,\u201d you heard your mother beg from behind you,\nresting her shaking hands on your shoulders. \u201cI know that you want\nto see your dad, and\u2014and that this is scary, but we\u2019ve gotta stick\ntogether.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>You didn\u2019t respond,\nwatching as the large man that drove the SUV motion for you two to\nfollow him down a nearby hallway. You followed his lead in a blur.\nThe hospital wing was deserted, all the doors down the blindingly\nwhite hallway ajar, allowing you to peer into the rooms. Every bed\nwas perfectly made, a fresh vase of flowers by every window. It was\nalmost eerie.</p><p>\u201cFor security\nreasons,\u201d came a deep voice through the haze. You looked into the\ndark sunglasses that looked back at you before they turned away. \u201cNo\none underneath or above the floor our people are on. We don\u2019t want\nanyone here that shouldn\u2019t be, and it\u2019s a hell of a lot easier to\nspot someone who doesn\u2019t belong when no one should be in this hallway\nin the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely \u2013 I\nmean, but patients were here, right?\u201d you stuttered. \u201cWhere did\nthey go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomewhere else,\u201d\nhe replied shortly, making it clear that the conversation was over.\nYou glanced back at your mother, who shrugged and gave you a look\nthat clearly said \u201c<i>stop asking questions</i>\u201d.</p><p>The three of you\napproached an elevator at the end of the off-putting corridor. There\nwasn\u2019t an up or down button, but a keypad and a finger print scanner.\nYour brows furrowed. Why in the hell was this place like a disguised\nprison instead of a hospital? Who\u2014or <i>what</i>\u2014was your father\nbeing protected from? A shiver ran down your spine.</p><p>The large man\nobscured your view with his shoulder blades, leaning down to punch in a\ncombination and scan his fingerprint. It was clear that you weren\u2019t\nsupposed to know how to get into this elevator without supervision.\nBut this was your <i>dad\u2014</i>he\ndidn\u2019t need protecting from you, from his family.</p><p>A\nloud alarm sounded throughout the hallway as the elevator arrived.\nYou were sure that everyone in the hospital could hear it, and maybe\nthat was the point\u2014no surprise visitors. The blaring ceased as the\ndoors opened and the three of you stepped inside. It was stainless\nsteel and spotless, sterile, like everything else around you.\nYou weren\u2019t sure if this was comforting you, or the opposite. It was\nclean, but there was no warmth.</p><p>The\nelevator did not have any indicator or screen that told you what\nfloor you were arriving to. You gulped as the doors finally parted\nfor you, a hallway even more blindingly white meeting your vision,\nbut this time it was full of people bustling around, all seemingly in\na hurry. Nurses were in protective suits, masks covering their faces,\nas they entered a room at the very end of the hallway with a large\ncaution indicator flashing above it. You couldn\u2019t believe what you\nwere seeing. It was like a scene from a science fiction movie.</p><p>\u201cYour\nfather isn\u2019t in there,\u201d a deep voice said, pulling you from your\nthoughts. Was that meant to be comforting? You looked up at his stony\nface, his lense-covered eyes betraying nothing. He simply motioned to\nhis right, down a separate hallway. You followed the\nbodyguard/driver/assassin/whatever-the-hell-he-was down the corridor,\nyour mother\u2019s hand raising to squeeze your shoulder again. He stopped\nat a door to his right and stepped to the side, his back against the\ndoor frame and clasping his fists in front of him, like a guard. He\nlooked at you and nodded toward the room, but then faced forward and\ngave no indication after that acknowledging your existence.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll\nbe alright, honey,\u201d your mother whispered into your ear as you\nslowly stepped into the room, hands balled into fists at your sides.\nWould your father be awake, be responsive? Would he be covered in\ncasts and bandages to the point of being unrecognizable? Would he be\nhooked up to machines with an endless array of wires? Would he be\n<i>okay</i>?</p><p>Your\nfather\u2019s bed came into view, but he was blocked by a team of nurses,\nchecking a few machines and muttering to each other in hushed tones.\nThe four women buzzing around his bed like bees around a hive made\nyour stomach churn.</p><p>\u201cOh,\nthe family\u2019s here,\u201d one announced, stepping back and sending you a\nsmall smile. The others looked up and quickly finished up whatever\nthey were doing. You still couldn\u2019t see him.</p><p>\u201cIs\nhe okay?\u201d you asked, not recognizing the weak voice that came out\nof your mouth. \u201cWhat happened? Why\u2014why does he need all of these\nmachines? What\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re\nkeeping an eye on him,\u201d answered the nurse, resting two of her\nhands on your shoulders as if to anchor you down. She smiled but her\neyes betrayed nothing, just like your security guard by the door. It\nwas then that you realized everyone here was the same: they\u2019d tell\nyou the bare minimum to keep whatever the hell happened at your dad\u2019s\nplace of work under wraps.</p><p>Frustration\nburned in your veins like hot coals, and your face must\u2019ve shown it,\nbecause her hands hastily left your shoulders and the nurses\nretreated from the room, taking every trace of paperwork with them.</p><p>And then you saw him.</p><p>He\nwas a pitiful sight, a bundle of bandages and blankets. Half of his\nface was obscured by gauze which had freshly been changed, his\nvisible eye swollen shut. He had a large chunk of hair missing from\nthe right side of his scalp, more gauze and wrappings covering the\narea. If you didn\u2019t know better, you\u2019d say he looked\u2026 <i>burned</i>.</p><p>You\nsucked in a deep, trembling breath at the sight of him, reaching to\nhold his hand but finding that it was covered in a bulky cast. Your\nthroat ached, tears rushing down your face despite your effort to\nkeep them walled back. \n</p><p><i>What happened?</i></p><p>Your mother sat at a\nchair on the other side of his bed, hands clasped over her mouth as\nif it would hold back the gasping sobs escaping her. The sound did\nnothing to strengthen your resolve.</p><p>\u201c<i>Daddy</i>\u2026\u201d\nyou whispered, softly touching the unblistered fingertips protruding\nfrom his cast. His bandaged face swam in your vision as more tears\nbetrayed you, making the room a blur of bright white light and\nswimming shapes.</p><p>As\nyour mother\u2019s cries echoed throughout the room, mixing with yours in\na chorus of heart-wrenching wails, you collapsed to your knees,\nholding onto your father\u2019s unresponsive fingertips like they\u2019d keep\nyou from drowning in a sea of your own tears.</p><p>In\nthat moment, as you felt yourself slip into a void, and saw your rock\nof a mother look more defeated than you\u2019d ever thought possible, you\ndecided something.</p><p>You\u2019d\nfind out what happened to your father. \n</p><p>No\nmatter what it took.</p><hr><p>You\nmissed school the next day, refusing to leave your dad\u2019s side. You\ndidn\u2019t eat, you didn\u2019t sleep, you didn\u2019t even go to the bathroom\nunless you absolutely couldn\u2019t hold it anymore, afraid you\u2019d miss\nsomething. The attending for the unit, Dr. Allard, came by a few\ntimes to assess your father\u2019s condition, telling you and your mother\nthat they were closely monitoring him at all hours. You even had the\nlady balls to straight-up ask him what was wrong with your father,\nand what had happened to cause these broken bones and charred skin,\nbut he just sighed painfully and gave you a look; a look that said,\n\u201c<i>you know that I can\u2019t tell you that</i>\u201d.</p><p>The\nfollowing day was tough one. You couldn\u2019t afford to miss any more\nschool; after all, you were already playing catch-up. As much as you\ndidn\u2019t want to leave your father\u2019s bedside, it was clear that you had\nno choice in the matter. You finally stopped arguing with your mom\nwhen she assured you that she would call the school if there was <i>any</i>\nchange in your dad\u2019s condition, for better or worse.</p><p>You\nchanged into the clothes she had packed for you before she picked you\nup from school, already knowing that you\u2019d refuse to leave your\nfather\u2019s side for something as trivial as clean clothes. You sighed a\nlittle guiltily, thanking her for being so thoughtful. You don\u2019t know\nhow she did it \u2013 you were barely functioning and you didn\u2019t have to\nworry about clothing or transporting or feeding a child on top of it\nall.</p><p>She\nhugged you tightly and whispered encouraging words in your ear before\nshe released you to the guard. You swung your backpack over your\nshoulder as you boarded the elevator with Tall, Dark, and Scary.</p><p>\u201cYou\nwon\u2019t tell me shit either, will you?\u201d you broke the silence as the\ndouble doors closed. You could slice the tension in the small space\nwith a butter knife, but in your angry and sleep-deprived state, you\nreally didn\u2019t care. Your father was severely injured and <i>someone</i>\nwas gonna answer for it.</p><p>The\nbig guy exhaled sharply through his nose but didn\u2019t look at you or\neven turn his head in your direction.</p><p>\u201cOh,\nso it\u2019s gonna be like that, huh?\u201d you challenged, nodding your head\nbitterly. \u201cI see how it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour\ndad\u2019s safe. That\u2019s all you need to know for now,\u201d he said.</p><p>You\nscoffed. \u201c<i>That\u2019s all I need to know for now?</i>\nReally?! My dad has had this job for less than a week and he\u2019s laid\nup in a hospital bed, comatose, covered in burns and\u2014and casts\nand\u2014<i>what the hell happened to him</i>?\nWhy won\u2019t anyone tell us anything? We deserve to know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour\ndad knew what he was signing up for when he took this job,\u201d the man\ngrowled, pointing a large finger in your face. You bit your tongue to\nkeep from slapping it away. \u201cIt\u2019s not pretty, and you\u2019re in the\ndark, and you\u2019re pissed. I get it. But there\u2019s a <i>reason</i>\nyou don\u2019t know more right now, and <i>trust me</i>\nwhen I say that it\u2019s a damn good one!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\n<i>seriously</i> doubt when\nhe signed the dotted line that having over half of his body burned\nwithin the month was on his mind,\u201d you seethed, venom in every last\nsyllable. \u201cThis is complete bullshit!\u201d</p><p>Patience\nand empathy was clearly not one of this man\u2019s strong suits as he\npursed his lips and clenched his fists; you even heard a knuckle pop.\nHe didn\u2019t say a word as the elevator doors opened and he strutted\ndown the hall, leaving you fuming behind him.</p><p>The\ncar ride was full of silent tension and searing stares. It was at\nmoments like this when you wished you were born with super powers, or\nwere a technical genius, so that you could get the kind of\ninformation you wanted. Holding a giant plasma canon in the guy\u2019s\nface or shooting lasers at him with your eyes would definitely loosen\nhis lips. For now, you\u2019d just have to settle with death glares in the\nrear view mirror. If he noticed, he didn\u2019t show it. Those stupid\nsunglasses made it impossible to tell, anyway.</p><p>As\nhe pulled up behind the bus lane, you exited the SUV as soon as you\npossibly could. He yelled something to you but you slammed the door\nin his face, giving you a faint sense of satisfaction. <i>That\u2019ll\nshow him</i>.</p><p>To\nyour shock, Ned and Peter were power-walking toward you. The moment\nthey\u2019d spotted you exiting the noticeable black vehicle in the sea of\nyellow buses, they weaved through the crowd of high school students.\nYou\u2019d only known the guys for a few days and they were approaching\nyou with such concern in their eyes that you didn\u2019t know what to\nthink.</p><p>\u201cHey,\nY/N!\u201d Ned yelled as he came closer, waving as if you couldn\u2019t see\nthem in the crowd. \u201cY/N!\u201d</p><p>You\ncouldn\u2019t help but smile slightly, shaking your head. Ned had a\npainstakingly clueless air about him sometimes.</p><p>\u201cHey,\nguys,\u201d you sighed as they stopped in front of you. You tried to\ngrin but the effort made your face hurt so you quickly abandoned the\nidea.</p><p>\u201cAre\nyou okay? What happened?\u201d Peter asked, such genuine concern in his\nbrown eyes and endless kindness in his voice. You felt your shoulders\nrelax.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\nwhat happened? You look <i>aw</i>ful,\u201d\nNed said. \n</p><p>You\nglared and raised your hands questioningly. Peter\u2019s head turned\ntoward Ned slowly, his expression incredulous. \n</p><p>\u201cGee,\nthanks, Ned,\u201d you scowled.</p><p>The\nreality of what he\u2019d said seemed to set in on him, and Ned\u2019s mouth\nformed an 'O\u2019. \n</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\ndidn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t look good,\u201d Ned said quickly. \u201cI mean,\nyou\u2019re like the hottest girl in school right now anyway, right,\nPeter?\u201d</p><p>Your\nstare morphed from a glare to confusion, and you looked to Peter. He\nsuddenly seemed intensely uncomfortable. Ned looked at Peter for\nsupport, raising his eyebrows, begging for his friend to help him out\nof the hole he\u2019d dug.</p><p>\u201cUh,\nI mean, you\u2014you always look g-good\u2026 great,\u201d Peter gulped,\nglaring at Ned and meeting your eyes anxiously.</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d\nNed added enthusiastically, nodding at you over Peter\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>You\nhuffed out a weak laugh. Ned looked relieved and Peter looked like he\nwanted to melt into a puddle. \u201cNice save, guys.\u201d</p><p>The\nbell rang and you turned toward the front doors, following the large\ncrowd of your classmates. You assumed that Ned and Peter were right\nbehind you, but when you turned to talk to them, you discovered that\nthey were a few feet back, Peter whispering furiously at Ned. You\ngrinned to yourself, thinking of Peter\u2019s flustered compliments. A\nsingle butterfly flapped its wings inside your stomach, and you\nsavored the feeling\u2014something other than fury and hopelessness was\na refreshing and welcome change.</p><p>The\nwolf whistles that followed you down the hallway that morning went in\none ear and out the other. Your mind was floating through the\nhospital and into the room with your father. Your hands shook as you\nopened your locker, unable to twist the correct combination until\nyour third try. Before the lock finally gave, you were about to start\ncrying.</p><p>\u201cHey,\ndo you need any help with your books?\u201d came a soft voice beside\nyou, and the frustrated tears threatening to spill retreated at the\nsound.</p><p>\u201cNo,\nit\u2019s okay, Peter,\u201d you said, stuffing two binders into your\nbackpack and putting three books into your locker. \u201cI\u2019m just a\nlittle\u2026 distracted, is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nget it,\u201d he said, swinging his backpack over one shoulder. \u201cIf\u2014if\nyou want to talk about it, I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m a good listener. Me and\nNed. We\u2019re good listeners.\u201d</p><p>You\nsmiled but it didn\u2019t reach your eyes, an all-too-familiar ache\nreturning to the middle of your throat.</p><p>\u201cUm,\nmaybe at lunch. It\u2019s kind of a long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d\nPeter nodded, eager to accommodate. You turned to walk toward\nhomeroom and Peter stayed by your side, talking about the next\nmachine that he and Ned were building for their class later in the\nday. It was obvious that he was doing his best to make conversation\nand keep your mind off of whatever was bothering you, and you were\nthankful. As far as you could tell, Peter was a total saint.</p><p>He\nstopped at the classroom door, suddenly self-conscious. He reached to\nscratch at the back of his neck, and the movement caught your eye. \n</p><p>\u201cSorry,\nyou probably don\u2019t even care about robotics,\u201d he apologized, almost\nembarrassed.</p><p>\u201cNo\nit\u2019s okay\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost\npeople don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\nPeter, anything you say is a thousand times better than what\u2019s going\non in my head right now,\u201d you smiled, touched. It did reach your\neyes this time, and your throat ached for a different reason. You\nlightly brushed his arm before hooking your thumbs back under you\nbackpack straps. \n</p><p>Peter Parker could read the phone book to you and you\u2019d listen with\nrapt attention.</p><p>He\nglanced at his forearm where you\u2019d touched him, and then up to your\neyes. They were so chocolate. There was a mix of relief and something\nelse swimming in them, and whatever the something else was, it added\na butterfly or two to the dancing colony in your stomach.</p><p>Peter\nseemed to catch himself. He pointed behind him. \u201cI\u2014I need to go.\nI\u2019ve already been late to English twice this week.\u201d</p><p>You\ngrinned. Now that you thought about it, Peter was almost late\nwherever he went.</p><p>\u201cSee\nyou at lunch, Parker.\u201d The corner of your lips pulled up.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nhe nodded, backing away but still facing you, \u201cyeah. Okay, bye.\u201d</p><p>Your\nhands didn\u2019t leave your backpack straps but you stretched out your\nfingers and wiggled them as a farewell. He smiled\u2014then proceeded to\nback into someone and almost make them drop their books.</p><p>You\nsnorted to yourself as he exclaimed \u201cSorry!\u201d at the unsuspecting guy\nand sprinted away down the hall.</p><p>Ned\nmade small talk with you in homeroom, and you could tell that he was\ndoing his best to distract you just like Peter was. There must\u2019ve\nbeen something about your face that revealed the turmoil tossing and\nturning beneath.</p><hr><p>Lunch\nwas a blessing. By the time the bell rang and freed you, the\nfrustration and need to vent were so strong that you were about to\nburst. Ned and Peter were smart guys and longtime New-Yorkers with\nplenty of experience in the alien invasion department. Surely they\u2019d\nhave <i>some</i> idea of what\nwas going on.</p><p>You\nwere the last to sit down at what had become your friend group\u2019s\ndesignated table. Ned and Peter were in a deep discussion that cut\noff the second you were within earshot. You tried not to be bothered\nby the fact that they always seemed to be changing subjects around\nyou\u2014after all, they\u2019d been best friends for years and they barely\nknew you. But it bugged you nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cSo,\nyou promised us a juicy story at lunch today,\u201d Ned reminded you,\ntone light and teasing. You\u2019d much rather his nonchalant approach\nthan anyone treating you like a cracking china doll. \n</p><p>You\nsighed and picked up your plastic fork, prodding what was supposed to\nbe spaghetti on your plate. With your stay in the hospital, packing\nlunch hadn\u2019t been an option.</p><p>\u201cWhere\ndo I even start?\u201d you exhaled, dropping the fork and pushing the\nplate away. You\u2019d suddenly lost your appetite, not that you had much\nof one in the first place. \u201cWith the bulletproof SUV? Or what about\nthe bodyguard that constantly has a stick shoved up his ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d\nPeter asked, clearly confused.</p><p>You\nrubbed your eyes and colorful stars appeared in the corners of your\nvision. \u201cIt\u2019s my dad. There was some kind of accident at his office\nand he\u2019s in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\nthat sucks,\u201d Ned breathed. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\nhappened?\u201d Peter asked, his brows pulled together.</p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t even know,\u201d you chuckled hopelessly. \u201cThey won\u2019t tell us\nanything. All the doctor will say is, 'we\u2019re keeping an eye on him\u2019.\nEvery time I ask someone a question I get looked at like I\u2019m about to\nhave a nervous breakdown or get shot, one of the two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N\u2026\nwhat exactly does your dad <i>do</i>?\u201d\nPeter inquired, leaning forward slightly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\na government job,\u201d you explained. \u201cI think the official term for\nhis division is Alien Affairs or something. I don\u2019t even know what he\ndoes. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m supposed to.\u201d</p><p>Something\nin Peter\u2019s body language changed. Ned\u2019s eyes snapped to him before\nlanding back on you.</p><p>\u201cThe\nbodyguard makes sense then\u2026\u201d Ned muttered, almost to himself.</p><p>\u201cAnd\nget this,\u201d you continued, the weight of holding all of your\nfrustrations inside beginning to lift, \u201cthe place is like a prison.\nNo one goes in or out without armed supervision, even family. And the\nfloors above and below where government employees are kept are empty,\nfor 'security reasons\u2019, they said. What the hell does that even\nmean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\nwould they be guarding a hospital if there was just an 'accident\u2019?\u201d\nNed wondered.</p><p>\u201cBecause\nit probably wasn\u2019t an accident,\u201d Peter replied, looking at one\nspot on the table. You could practically hear the whir of wheels\nturning inside of his brain.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014what\ndo you mean it wasn\u2019t an accident?\u201d you blanched, trying to catch\nhis eye, but his were still glued to the table.</p><p>He\nfinally met your prodding gaze and suddenly seemed a little nervous,\nlike he had a time limit to get all of the words out. \u201cI mean,\ny-you know, Mr. Stark deals with the government all the time. He says\nthey lie more than they tell the truth. Everything is, uh, always\ncovered up until they\u2019re sure they aren\u2019t liable for anything.\u201d</p><p>You\nshrugged and rolled your eyes at the accuracy. \u201cSounds about\nright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid\nthey at least mention when he\u2019d be released?\u201d Ned asked.</p><p>You\nshook your head and looked at your lap, fighting back the stinging at\nthe corner of your eyes. \u201cNo. But it won\u2019t be anytime soon. You\nshould\u2019ve seen him\u2026 he looks <i>burned</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo\nyou think there was a fire or something?\u201d Ned asked.</p><p>\u201cOr\nmaybe it\u2019s chemical burns. I don\u2019t know,\u201d you sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s the not knowing that\u2019s the worst.\u201d</p><p>Peter\nhad gone quiet, and you found yourself biting the inside of your\ncheek. Was he awkward around talk of grief? Maybe he was\nuncomfortable. But no, something told you, he\u2019s thinking. Thinking\nhard.</p><p>\u201cWhat\nis it, Peter?\u201d you asked, your voice a mixture of hope and caution.\nWhat if he said something that you didn\u2019t want to hear?</p><p>He\nsuddenly bolted out of his seat, his chair tumbling to the floor with\na loud clatter.

The black car your mother had taken to\nthe school was a company car &ndash; a government car. With a driver. It\nall seemed so cold and official. Your mom was crying beside you in\nthe backseat but unsuccessfully trying to hide it, for your sake. She\ntried to explain through her sobs what happened at your father&rsquo;s\nworkplace, but it seemed that she didn&rsquo;t really know many details at\nall. Everything government-related was secretive, especially when it\nconcerned alien affairs, and <i>especially </i>when\nthe word &lsquo;accident&rsquo; was thrown around. You were sure that they were\nkeeping you and your mother in the dark about what happened &ndash; you&rsquo;d\nbet money that they always knew more than they were saying.</p><p>The man in the suit\nand sunglasses behind the wheel never said a word and his facial\nexpression never changed throughout the drive to the hospital. He\nseemed entirely uninviting. You noticed a bulge at his side\nunderneath his suit jacket, and it didn&rsquo;t take more than a moment to\nrealize that it was a gun. Of course it was. What was he,\nsecurity detail? To keep you and your mother safe or to maybe keep\nyou two from probing more than you should be into the incident?\nEither way, you found his presence completely unnecessary and a bit\nunnerving.</p><p>Pulling up to the\nhospital, you threw open the SUV door before the vehicle was\ncompletely stopped and ran toward the doors despite your mother&rsquo;s\nprotests. The lobby was cold and sterile, bringing chill bumps to\nyour arms. Your sense of foreboding only heightened.</p><p>&ldquo;Baby, don&rsquo;t go\nrunning off like that,&rdquo; you heard your mother beg from behind you,\nresting her shaking hands on your shoulders. &ldquo;I know that you want\nto see your dad, and&mdash;and that this is scary, but we&rsquo;ve gotta stick\ntogether.&rdquo;</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t respond,\nwatching as the large man that drove the SUV motion for you two to\nfollow him down a nearby hallway. You followed his lead in a blur.\nThe hospital wing was deserted, all the doors down the blindingly\nwhite hallway ajar, allowing you to peer into the rooms. Every bed\nwas perfectly made, a fresh vase of flowers by every window. It was\nalmost eerie.</p><p>&ldquo;For security\nreasons,&rdquo; came a deep voice through the haze. You looked into the\ndark sunglasses that looked back at you before they turned away. &ldquo;No\none underneath or above the floor our people are on. We don&rsquo;t want\nanyone here that shouldn&rsquo;t be, and it&rsquo;s a hell of a lot easier to\nspot someone who doesn&rsquo;t belong when no one should be in this hallway\nin the first place.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Surely &ndash; I\nmean, but patients were here, right?&rdquo; you stuttered. &ldquo;Where did\nthey go?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Somewhere else,&rdquo;\nhe replied shortly, making it clear that the conversation was over.\nYou glanced back at your mother, who shrugged and gave you a look\nthat clearly said &ldquo;<i>stop asking questions</i>&rdquo;.</p><p>The three of you\napproached an elevator at the end of the off-putting corridor. There\nwasn&rsquo;t an up or down button, but a keypad and a finger print scanner.\nYour brows furrowed. Why in the hell was this place like a disguised\nprison instead of a hospital? Who&mdash;or <i>what</i>&mdash;was your father\nbeing protected from? A shiver ran down your spine.</p><p>The large man\nobscured your view with his shoulder blades, leaning down to punch in a\ncombination and scan his fingerprint. It was clear that you weren&rsquo;t\nsupposed to know how to get into this elevator without supervision.\nBut this was your <i>dad&mdash;</i>he\ndidn&rsquo;t need protecting from you, from his family.</p><p>A\nloud alarm sounded throughout the hallway as the elevator arrived.\nYou were sure that everyone in the hospital could hear it, and maybe\nthat was the point&mdash;no surprise visitors. The blaring ceased as the\ndoors opened and the three of you stepped inside. It was stainless\nsteel and spotless, sterile, like everything else around you.\nYou weren&rsquo;t sure if this was comforting you, or the opposite. It was\nclean, but there was no warmth.</p><p>The\nelevator did not have any indicator or screen that told you what\nfloor you were arriving to. You gulped as the doors finally parted\nfor you, a hallway even more blindingly white meeting your vision,\nbut this time it was full of people bustling around, all seemingly in\na hurry. Nurses were in protective suits, masks covering their faces,\nas they entered a room at the very end of the hallway with a large\ncaution indicator flashing above it. You couldn&rsquo;t believe what you\nwere seeing. It was like a scene from a science fiction movie.</p><p>&ldquo;Your\nfather isn&rsquo;t in there,&rdquo; a deep voice said, pulling you from your\nthoughts. Was that meant to be comforting? You looked up at his stony\nface, his lense-covered eyes betraying nothing. He simply motioned to\nhis right, down a separate hallway. You followed the\nbodyguard/driver/assassin/whatever-the-hell-he-was down the corridor,\nyour mother&rsquo;s hand raising to squeeze your shoulder again. He stopped\nat a door to his right and stepped to the side, his back against the\ndoor frame and clasping his fists in front of him, like a guard. He\nlooked at you and nodded toward the room, but then faced forward and\ngave no indication after that acknowledging your existence.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll\nbe alright, honey,&rdquo; your mother whispered into your ear as you\nslowly stepped into the room, hands balled into fists at your sides.\nWould your father be awake, be responsive? Would he be covered in\ncasts and bandages to the point of being unrecognizable? Would he be\nhooked up to machines with an endless array of wires? Would he be\n<i>okay</i>?</p><p>Your\nfather&rsquo;s bed came into view, but he was blocked by a team of nurses,\nchecking a few machines and muttering to each other in hushed tones.\nThe four women buzzing around his bed like bees around a hive made\nyour stomach churn.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,\nthe family&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; one announced, stepping back and sending you a\nsmall smile. The others looked up and quickly finished up whatever\nthey were doing. You still couldn&rsquo;t see him.</p><p>&ldquo;Is\nhe okay?&rdquo; you asked, not recognizing the weak voice that came out\nof your mouth. &ldquo;What happened? Why&mdash;why does he need all of these\nmachines? What&mdash;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re\nkeeping an eye on him,&rdquo; answered the nurse, resting two of her\nhands on your shoulders as if to anchor you down. She smiled but her\neyes betrayed nothing, just like your security guard by the door. It\nwas then that you realized everyone here was the same: they&rsquo;d tell\nyou the bare minimum to keep whatever the hell happened at your dad&rsquo;s\nplace of work under wraps.</p><p>Frustration\nburned in your veins like hot coals, and your face must&rsquo;ve shown it,\nbecause her hands hastily left your shoulders and the nurses\nretreated from the room, taking every trace of paperwork with them.</p><p>And then you saw him.</p><p>He\nwas a pitiful sight, a bundle of bandages and blankets. Half of his\nface was obscured by gauze which had freshly been changed, his\nvisible eye swollen shut. He had a large chunk of hair missing from\nthe right side of his scalp, more gauze and wrappings covering the\narea. If you didn&rsquo;t know better, you&rsquo;d say he looked&hellip; <i>burned</i>.</p><p>You\nsucked in a deep, trembling breath at the sight of him, reaching to\nhold his hand but finding that it was covered in a bulky cast. Your\nthroat ached, tears rushing down your face despite your effort to\nkeep them walled back. \n</p><p><i>What happened?</i></p><p>Your mother sat at a\nchair on the other side of his bed, hands clasped over her mouth as\nif it would hold back the gasping sobs escaping her. The sound did\nnothing to strengthen your resolve.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Daddy</i>&hellip;&rdquo;\nyou whispered, softly touching the unblistered fingertips protruding\nfrom his cast. His bandaged face swam in your vision as more tears\nbetrayed you, making the room a blur of bright white light and\nswimming shapes.</p><p>As\nyour mother&rsquo;s cries echoed throughout the room, mixing with yours in\na chorus of heart-wrenching wails, you collapsed to your knees,\nholding onto your father&rsquo;s unresponsive fingertips like they&rsquo;d keep\nyou from drowning in a sea of your own tears.</p><p>In\nthat moment, as you felt yourself slip into a void, and saw your rock\nof a mother look more defeated than you&rsquo;d ever thought possible, you\ndecided something.</p><p>You&rsquo;d\nfind out what happened to your father. \n</p><p>No\nmatter what it took.</p><hr /><p>You\nmissed school the next day, refusing to leave your dad&rsquo;s side. You\ndidn&rsquo;t eat, you didn&rsquo;t sleep, you didn&rsquo;t even go to the bathroom\nunless you absolutely couldn&rsquo;t hold it anymore, afraid you&rsquo;d miss\nsomething. The attending for the unit, Dr. Allard, came by a few\ntimes to assess your father&rsquo;s condition, telling you and your mother\nthat they were closely monitoring him at all hours. You even had the\nlady balls to straight-up ask him what was wrong with your father,\nand what had happened to cause these broken bones and charred skin,\nbut he just sighed painfully and gave you a look; a look that said,\n&ldquo;<i>you know that I can&rsquo;t tell you that</i>&rdquo;.</p><p>The\nfollowing day was tough one. You couldn&rsquo;t afford to miss any more\nschool; after all, you were already playing catch-up. As much as you\ndidn&rsquo;t want to leave your father&rsquo;s bedside, it was clear that you had\nno choice in the matter. You finally stopped arguing with your mom\nwhen she assured you that she would call the school if there was <i>any</i>\nchange in your dad&rsquo;s condition, for better or worse.</p><p>You\nchanged into the clothes she had packed for you before she picked you\nup from school, already knowing that you&rsquo;d refuse to leave your\nfather&rsquo;s side for something as trivial as clean clothes. You sighed a\nlittle guiltily, thanking her for being so thoughtful. You don&rsquo;t know\nhow she did it &ndash; you were barely functioning and you didn&rsquo;t have to\nworry about clothing or transporting or feeding a child on top of it\nall.</p><p>She\nhugged you tightly and whispered encouraging words in your ear before\nshe released you to the guard. You swung your backpack over your\nshoulder as you boarded the elevator with Tall, Dark, and Scary.</p><p>&ldquo;You\nwon&rsquo;t tell me shit either, will you?&rdquo; you broke the silence as the\ndouble doors closed. You could slice the tension in the small space\nwith a butter knife, but in your angry and sleep-deprived state, you\nreally didn&rsquo;t care. Your father was severely injured and <i>someone</i>\nwas gonna answer for it.</p><p>The\nbig guy exhaled sharply through his nose but didn&rsquo;t look at you or\neven turn his head in your direction.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,\nso it&rsquo;s gonna be like that, huh?&rdquo; you challenged, nodding your head\nbitterly. &ldquo;I see how it is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your\ndad&rsquo;s safe. That&rsquo;s all you need to know for now,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>You\nscoffed. &ldquo;<i>That&rsquo;s all I need to know for now?</i>\nReally?! My dad has had this job for less than a week and he&rsquo;s laid\nup in a hospital bed, comatose, covered in burns and&mdash;and casts\nand&mdash;<i>what the hell happened to him</i>?\nWhy won&rsquo;t anyone tell us anything? We deserve to know!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your\ndad knew what he was signing up for when he took this job,&rdquo; the man\ngrowled, pointing a large finger in your face. You bit your tongue to\nkeep from slapping it away. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not pretty, and you&rsquo;re in the\ndark, and you&rsquo;re pissed. I get it. But there&rsquo;s a <i>reason</i>\nyou don&rsquo;t know more right now, and <i>trust me</i>\nwhen I say that it&rsquo;s a damn good one!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\n<i>seriously</i> doubt when\nhe signed the dotted line that having over half of his body burned\nwithin the month was on his mind,&rdquo; you seethed, venom in every last\nsyllable. &ldquo;This is complete bullshit!&rdquo;</p><p>Patience\nand empathy was clearly not one of this man&rsquo;s strong suits as he\npursed his lips and clenched his fists; you even heard a knuckle pop.\nHe didn&rsquo;t say a word as the elevator doors opened and he strutted\ndown the hall, leaving you fuming behind him.</p><p>The\ncar ride was full of silent tension and searing stares. It was at\nmoments like this when you wished you were born with super powers, or\nwere a technical genius, so that you could get the kind of\ninformation you wanted. Holding a giant plasma canon in the guy&rsquo;s\nface or shooting lasers at him with your eyes would definitely loosen\nhis lips. For now, you&rsquo;d just have to settle with death glares in the\nrear view mirror. If he noticed, he didn&rsquo;t show it. Those stupid\nsunglasses made it impossible to tell, anyway.</p><p>As\nhe pulled up behind the bus lane, you exited the SUV as soon as you\npossibly could. He yelled something to you but you slammed the door\nin his face, giving you a faint sense of satisfaction. <i>That&rsquo;ll\nshow him</i>.</p><p>To\nyour shock, Ned and Peter were power-walking toward you. The moment\nthey&rsquo;d spotted you exiting the noticeable black vehicle in the sea of\nyellow buses, they weaved through the crowd of high school students.\nYou&rsquo;d only known the guys for a few days and they were approaching\nyou with such concern in their eyes that you didn&rsquo;t know what to\nthink.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,\nY/N!&rdquo; Ned yelled as he came closer, waving as if you couldn&rsquo;t see\nthem in the crowd. &ldquo;Y/N!&rdquo;</p><p>You\ncouldn&rsquo;t help but smile slightly, shaking your head. Ned had a\npainstakingly clueless air about him sometimes.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,\nguys,&rdquo; you sighed as they stopped in front of you. You tried to\ngrin but the effort made your face hurt so you quickly abandoned the\nidea.</p><p>&ldquo;Are\nyou okay? What happened?&rdquo; Peter asked, such genuine concern in his\nbrown eyes and endless kindness in his voice. You felt your shoulders\nrelax.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,\nwhat happened? You look <i>aw</i>ful,&rdquo;\nNed said. \n</p><p>You\nglared and raised your hands questioningly. Peter&rsquo;s head turned\ntoward Ned slowly, his expression incredulous. \n</p><p>&ldquo;Gee,\nthanks, Ned,&rdquo; you scowled.</p><p>The\nreality of what he&rsquo;d said seemed to set in on him, and Ned&rsquo;s mouth\nformed an 'O&rsquo;. \n</p><p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I\ndidn&rsquo;t mean that you don&rsquo;t look good,&rdquo; Ned said quickly. &ldquo;I mean,\nyou&rsquo;re like the hottest girl in school right now anyway, right,\nPeter?&rdquo;</p><p>Your\nstare morphed from a glare to confusion, and you looked to Peter. He\nsuddenly seemed intensely uncomfortable. Ned looked at Peter for\nsupport, raising his eyebrows, begging for his friend to help him out\nof the hole he&rsquo;d dug.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh,\nI mean, you&mdash;you always look g-good&hellip; great,&rdquo; Peter gulped,\nglaring at Ned and meeting your eyes anxiously.</p><p>&ldquo;Always,&rdquo;\nNed added enthusiastically, nodding at you over Peter&rsquo;s shoulder.</p><p>You\nhuffed out a weak laugh. Ned looked relieved and Peter looked like he\nwanted to melt into a puddle. &ldquo;Nice save, guys.&rdquo;</p><p>The\nbell rang and you turned toward the front doors, following the large\ncrowd of your classmates. You assumed that Ned and Peter were right\nbehind you, but when you turned to talk to them, you discovered that\nthey were a few feet back, Peter whispering furiously at Ned. You\ngrinned to yourself, thinking of Peter&rsquo;s flustered compliments. A\nsingle butterfly flapped its wings inside your stomach, and you\nsavored the feeling&mdash;something other than fury and hopelessness was\na refreshing and welcome change.</p><p>The\nwolf whistles that followed you down the hallway that morning went in\none ear and out the other. Your mind was floating through the\nhospital and into the room with your father. Your hands shook as you\nopened your locker, unable to twist the correct combination until\nyour third try. Before the lock finally gave, you were about to start\ncrying.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,\ndo you need any help with your books?&rdquo; came a soft voice beside\nyou, and the frustrated tears threatening to spill retreated at the\nsound.</p><p>&ldquo;No,\nit&rsquo;s okay, Peter,&rdquo; you said, stuffing two binders into your\nbackpack and putting three books into your locker. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just a\nlittle&hellip; distracted, is all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\nget it,&rdquo; he said, swinging his backpack over one shoulder. &ldquo;If&mdash;if\nyou want to talk about it, I&rsquo;ve been told I&rsquo;m a good listener. Me and\nNed. We&rsquo;re good listeners.&rdquo;</p><p>You\nsmiled but it didn&rsquo;t reach your eyes, an all-too-familiar ache\nreturning to the middle of your throat.</p><p>&ldquo;Um,\nmaybe at lunch. It&rsquo;s kind of a long story.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo;\nPeter nodded, eager to accommodate. You turned to walk toward\nhomeroom and Peter stayed by your side, talking about the next\nmachine that he and Ned were building for their class later in the\nday. It was obvious that he was doing his best to make conversation\nand keep your mind off of whatever was bothering you, and you were\nthankful. As far as you could tell, Peter was a total saint.</p><p>He\nstopped at the classroom door, suddenly self-conscious. He reached to\nscratch at the back of his neck, and the movement caught your eye. \n</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,\nyou probably don&rsquo;t even care about robotics,&rdquo; he apologized, almost\nembarrassed.</p><p>&ldquo;No\nit&rsquo;s okay&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Most\npeople don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,\nPeter, anything you say is a thousand times better than what&rsquo;s going\non in my head right now,&rdquo; you smiled, touched. It did reach your\neyes this time, and your throat ached for a different reason. You\nlightly brushed his arm before hooking your thumbs back under you\nbackpack straps. \n</p><p>Peter Parker could read the phone book to you and you&rsquo;d listen with\nrapt attention.</p><p>He\nglanced at his forearm where you&rsquo;d touched him, and then up to your\neyes. They were so chocolate. There was a mix of relief and something\nelse swimming in them, and whatever the something else was, it added\na butterfly or two to the dancing colony in your stomach.</p><p>Peter\nseemed to catch himself. He pointed behind him. &ldquo;I&mdash;I need to go.\nI&rsquo;ve already been late to English twice this week.&rdquo;</p><p>You\ngrinned. Now that you thought about it, Peter was almost late\nwherever he went.</p><p>&ldquo;See\nyou at lunch, Parker.&rdquo; The corner of your lips pulled up.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo;\nhe nodded, backing away but still facing you, &ldquo;yeah. Okay, bye.&rdquo;</p><p>Your\nhands didn&rsquo;t leave your backpack straps but you stretched out your\nfingers and wiggled them as a farewell. He smiled&mdash;then proceeded to\nback into someone and almost make them drop their books.</p><p>You\nsnorted to yourself as he exclaimed &ldquo;Sorry!&rdquo; at the unsuspecting guy\nand sprinted away down the hall.</p><p>Ned\nmade small talk with you in homeroom, and you could tell that he was\ndoing his best to distract you just like Peter was. There must&rsquo;ve\nbeen something about your face that revealed the turmoil tossing and\nturning beneath.</p><hr /><p>Lunch\nwas a blessing. By the time the bell rang and freed you, the\nfrustration and need to vent were so strong that you were about to\nburst. Ned and Peter were smart guys and longtime New-Yorkers with\nplenty of experience in the alien invasion department. Surely they&rsquo;d\nhave <i>some</i> idea of what\nwas going on.</p><p>You\nwere the last to sit down at what had become your friend group&rsquo;s\ndesignated table. Ned and Peter were in a deep discussion that cut\noff the second you were within earshot. You tried not to be bothered\nby the fact that they always seemed to be changing subjects around\nyou&mdash;after all, they&rsquo;d been best friends for years and they barely\nknew you. But it bugged you nonetheless.</p><p>&ldquo;So,\nyou promised us a juicy story at lunch today,&rdquo; Ned reminded you,\ntone light and teasing. You&rsquo;d much rather his nonchalant approach\nthan anyone treating you like a cracking china doll. \n</p><p>You\nsighed and picked up your plastic fork, prodding what was supposed to\nbe spaghetti on your plate. With your stay in the hospital, packing\nlunch hadn&rsquo;t been an option.</p><p>&ldquo;Where\ndo I even start?&rdquo; you exhaled, dropping the fork and pushing the\nplate away. You&rsquo;d suddenly lost your appetite, not that you had much\nof one in the first place. &ldquo;With the bulletproof SUV? Or what about\nthe bodyguard that constantly has a stick shoved up his ass?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;\nPeter asked, clearly confused.</p><p>You\nrubbed your eyes and colorful stars appeared in the corners of your\nvision. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my dad. There was some kind of accident at his office\nand he&rsquo;s in the hospital.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,\nthat sucks,&rdquo; Ned breathed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What\nhappened?&rdquo; Peter asked, his brows pulled together.</p><p>&ldquo;I\ndon&rsquo;t even know,&rdquo; you chuckled hopelessly. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t tell us\nanything. All the doctor will say is, 'we&rsquo;re keeping an eye on him&rsquo;.\nEvery time I ask someone a question I get looked at like I&rsquo;m about to\nhave a nervous breakdown or get shot, one of the two.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N&hellip;\nwhat exactly does your dad <i>do</i>?&rdquo;\nPeter inquired, leaning forward slightly.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\na government job,&rdquo; you explained. &ldquo;I think the official term for\nhis division is Alien Affairs or something. I don&rsquo;t even know what he\ndoes. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m supposed to.&rdquo;</p><p>Something\nin Peter&rsquo;s body language changed. Ned&rsquo;s eyes snapped to him before\nlanding back on you.</p><p>&ldquo;The\nbodyguard makes sense then&hellip;&rdquo; Ned muttered, almost to himself.</p><p>&ldquo;And\nget this,&rdquo; you continued, the weight of holding all of your\nfrustrations inside beginning to lift, &ldquo;the place is like a prison.\nNo one goes in or out without armed supervision, even family. And the\nfloors above and below where government employees are kept are empty,\nfor 'security reasons&rsquo;, they said. What the hell does that even\nmean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why\nwould they be guarding a hospital if there was just an 'accident&rsquo;?&rdquo;\nNed wondered.</p><p>&ldquo;Because\nit probably wasn&rsquo;t an accident,&rdquo; Peter replied, looking at one\nspot on the table. You could practically hear the whir of wheels\nturning inside of his brain.</p><p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what\ndo you mean it wasn&rsquo;t an accident?&rdquo; you blanched, trying to catch\nhis eye, but his were still glued to the table.</p><p>He\nfinally met your prodding gaze and suddenly seemed a little nervous,\nlike he had a time limit to get all of the words out. &ldquo;I mean,\ny-you know, Mr. Stark deals with the government all the time. He says\nthey lie more than they tell the truth. Everything is, uh, always\ncovered up until they&rsquo;re sure they aren&rsquo;t liable for anything.&rdquo;</p><p>You\nshrugged and rolled your eyes at the accuracy. &ldquo;Sounds about\nright.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did\nthey at least mention when he&rsquo;d be released?&rdquo; Ned asked.</p><p>You\nshook your head and looked at your lap, fighting back the stinging at\nthe corner of your eyes. &ldquo;No. But it won&rsquo;t be anytime soon. You\nshould&rsquo;ve seen him&hellip; he looks <i>burned</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do\nyou think there was a fire or something?&rdquo; Ned asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Or\nmaybe it&rsquo;s chemical burns. I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; you sighed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the not knowing that&rsquo;s the worst.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter\nhad gone quiet, and you found yourself biting the inside of your\ncheek. Was he awkward around talk of grief? Maybe he was\nuncomfortable. But no, something told you, he&rsquo;s thinking. Thinking\nhard.</p><p>&ldquo;What\nis it, Peter?&rdquo; you asked, your voice a mixture of hope and caution.\nWhat if he said something that you didn&rsquo;t want to hear?</p><p>He\nsuddenly bolted out of his seat, his chair tumbling to the floor with\na loud clatter.

The black car your mother had taken to\nthe school was a company car &ndash; a government car. With a driver. It\nall seemed so cold and official. Your mom was crying beside you in\nthe backseat but unsuccessfully trying to hide it, for your sake. She\ntried to explain through her sobs what happened at your father&rsquo;s\nworkplace, but it seemed that she didn&rsquo;t really know many details at\nall. Everything government-related was secretive, especially when it\nconcerned alien affairs, and <i>especially </i>when\nthe word &lsquo;accident&rsquo; was thrown around. You were sure that they were\nkeeping you and your mother in the dark about what happened &ndash; you&rsquo;d\nbet money that they always knew more than they were saying.</p>\n<p>The man in the suit\nand sunglasses behind the wheel never said a word and his facial\nexpression never changed throughout the drive to the hospital. He\nseemed entirely uninviting. You noticed a bulge at his side\nunderneath his suit jacket, and it didn&rsquo;t take more than a moment to\nrealize that it was a gun. Of course it was. What was he,\nsecurity detail? To keep you and your mother safe or to maybe keep\nyou two from probing more than you should be into the incident?\nEither way, you found his presence completely unnecessary and a bit\nunnerving.</p>\n<p>Pulling up to the\nhospital, you threw open the SUV door before the vehicle was\ncompletely stopped and ran toward the doors despite your mother&rsquo;s\nprotests. The lobby was cold and sterile, bringing chill bumps to\nyour arms. Your sense of foreboding only heightened.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Baby, don&rsquo;t go\nrunning off like that,&rdquo; you heard your mother beg from behind you,\nresting her shaking hands on your shoulders. &ldquo;I know that you want\nto see your dad, and&mdash;and that this is scary, but we&rsquo;ve gotta stick\ntogether.&rdquo;</p>\n</p>",
