He inhales her perfume;\nChanel, and relishes in the gentle touch, the warmth and security the simple\ngesture provides. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cSo what is it?\u201d he\nasks when she pulls back and takes his hand, squeezing it gently. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell, you\u2019re the\nfirst to know,\u201d she tells him, smile widening and eyes brightening. \u201cYou\u2019re\ngoing to be a big brother.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>He stares at her for a\nmoment before his gaze flickers down to her still flat stomach; wonder and\nconfusion and excitement filling him. He reaches out hesitantly, glances up to\nfind her watching and when she realizes his intent she smiles and takes his\nhand, presses it to her belly so he can feel the soft curve there. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s too soon to feel\nhim moving, but he\u2019s in there,\u201d she tells him, grinning conspiratorially, \u201che\u2019s\nabout the size of a blueberry right now. In a few weeks you\u2019ll be able to feel\nhim flipping around in there.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Tony grins and throws\nhimself into her arms, her soft oof melting easily into laughter. \u201cThat\u2019s so\ncool mom,\u201d he whispers before a firm hand at his shoulder pulls him back and\nhis father is frowning at him, shaking his head. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that\nTony, your mother is in a delicate stage, you have to be gentle.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>He nods solemnly and\nthen looks back at his mother apologetically, \u201cSorry,\u201d he whispers, \u201cDid\nI&hellip;hurt it?\u201d he asks fearfully. Tears burn in his eyes; he loves his mother,\nand if he hurt her&hellip;</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Maria shakes her head\nand opens her arms, \u201cCome here sweetie, it\u2019s ok, we just have to be gentle,\u201d\nshe murmurs as he curls back into her arms. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>He hears Howard huff\nand feels it when he stands from the couch, \u201cYou shoudn\u2019t coddle him Maria. He\nneeds to know what can happen if he\u2019s irresponsible. Tony, let her go,\u201d he\norders, yanking on Tony\u2019s arm till it hurts and he\u2019s pulled away from his mother\nand onto his feet. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Howard looms over him,\nfrowning, \u201cIt\u2019s your responsibility to help your mother Tony. She\u2019ll need to\nrest and sleep and I can\u2019t have you bothering her. Do you understand? If you\ntire her out, the baby will die.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Fear clutches his\nbelly and he glances to his mother with wide eyes, then back to his father,\nnodding emphatically. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cI promise, I\u2019ll\nprotect her,\u201d he vows with all the solemnity a nine year old can muster. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Howard studies him a\nmoment before waving a hand, dismissing him. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>He pauses at the door\nand glances back to find his father already heading back to his office and his\nmother, still sitting on the couch, staring into the distance with a hollow\nlook on her face. He sees the bruise on her cheekbone and another on her wrist,\ntoo thin and delicate and he shivers, promises himself that he\u2019ll do better to\nprotect her, to make sure she\u2019s okay. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>It\u2019s his job, his\nresponsibility, and he won\u2019t fail anymore. </i></p><!-- more --><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry sir, but the latest iteration has proven\nunsuccessful.\u201d</p><p>Tony sighs heavily and sets aside the soldering iron, hands\ncramping after such delicate work and runs a hand over his face and through his\nhair, \u201cRight. Keep going,\u201d he orders. \u201cMake note of any useful data and apply\nit moving forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes sir. Might I suggest a break sir? It\u2019s been 18 hours since\nyour last meal.\u201d</p><p>Tony shifts in his seat and rolls his shoulders, \u201cYea, sure,\norder a sandwich from the kitchen. Turkey and bacon on rye. No onion. Have them\nsend a soda too, root beer please.\u201d</p><p>JARVIS confirms the order and goes back to running trials on the\ndrug Tony\u2019s been trying to develop as a cure for AIDS, but he\u2019s no biochemist,\nso most of this is guess work and it drives him a little crazier every time an\niteration fails. </p><p>He stands and stretches, groans as his muscles protest. He\u2019s\ntired but has no real drive to sleep, not when he could be working on this. Not\nnow that it\u2019s life and death for the most important person in his life. Now\nit\u2019s up to him to keep Rhodey healthy while he searches for a way to cure him\nor treat him, anything to make sure he doesn\u2019t become one of the thousands that\nhave already died because of this disease. </p><p>With more data sets he could see how the drug he\u2019s testing is\nworking on different patients, but it\u2019s not like he has access to that many\npeople with AIDS. Pausing, he stands and breathes as an idea takes form. He\nlets it sink in and grow and then exhales unsteadily, excitement rising within\nhim.</p><p>\u201cJARVIS, contact Pepper and get her here. I\u2019ll also need the\nname of a biochemist and molecular engineer. Check and see if Bruce Banner is\nworking with any organizations, it\u2019s been a few years since we\u2019ve talked but he\nmight have a recommendation. Is there anyone at SI qualified?\u201d</p><p>He paces as he asks questions, mind whirling a mile a minute.\n\u201cGet me Rhodey after Pepper and start a new project,\u201d he orders, grin growing\nwith each second that passes. </p><p>\u201cVery good sir, Miss Potts has been notified and is on her way,\nestimated time of arrival, 2:33pm. What shall we call the project sir?\u201d</p><p>Tony grins. </p><p>\u201cProject Blue Sky.\u201d</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>Peter huffs in disappointment, hanging up the phone after yet\nanother fruitless call to Stark Industries. Pepper hasn\u2019t been the font of\ninformation he\u2019s been hoping for, despite their sort of friendship and her\nbudding relationship with MJ. She\u2019s been polite but distant, insisting that she\ndoesn\u2019t know anything about how the Stark weapons ended up in the hands of the\nTen Rings, and surprisingly, he believes her. </p><p>To his even greater disappointment, Peggy hasn\u2019t turned anything\nup either\u2014her resources within Iraq are limited and to get that kind of\ninformation would require her longest term asset to break cover, something\nshe\u2019d told him she couldn\u2019t do. </p><p>So he\u2019s back to square one. </p><p>He hasn\u2019t seen or heard from Stark(and he has to think of him as\nStark because Tony is the man who had bandaged his hand and nearly kissed him\nin the moonlight and he can\u2019t think of him like that because it hurts too much)\nin the weeks since he confronted him at the Gala, but he\u2019s read the articles on\nStark Industries and the new changes he\u2019s been implementing. Clean energy,\ninternet access for the masses, investment in medical technology and\npharmaceuticals, and a new clinic for AIDS and HIV patients have all taken the\ncity and the economy by storm. </p><p>He tries not to watch the interviews Stark does, stays silent at\nthe press gaggles and avoids eye contact when the older man\u2019s gaze flickers\nover the crowds, always searching for him, but he can\u2019t avoid him forever, he\nknows that. At some point he\u2019ll have to speak to him because Jameson is growing\nangrier each time he comes back without a quote for the paper. </p><p>Sighing, he glances at the clock and turns his attention back to\nhis article on the Hudson River cleanup effort\u2014if he can get it done and to the\ncopy editor before five he\u2019ll be able to head out early and avoid the traffic\non his way downtown. Steve had finally gotten a job at a local art gallery,\nteaching an introductory class three times a week and tonight is their first\nshow of the student\u2019s art. </p><p>It\u2019s a quarter to five when he finishes, giving him just enough\ntime to stop at a flower stand and buy a few bundles of faded roses for the\nstudents. He hails a cab and sits back, watching the skyline change as they\ndrive, heart lurching when the familiar shape of Stark Tower passes by,\nthrowing a shadow onto the road below. </p><p>He think how much like the tower Tony is; larger than life,\ninfamous, untouchable. </p><p>Swallowing through a thick throat, he turns away and focuses on\nthe signs and faces slipping by. </p><p>It\u2019s just another building in a city full to overflowing with\ntoo many people and not enough heart. </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>The clinic won\u2019t be on its feet for another month so Tony\u2019s\nreduced to searching through his father\u2019s old files, searching for anything\nthat might help. He\u2019s heard the stories of the men his father had worked with\nduring WWII, trying to create an enhanced super soldier, but as he had heard\nover and over again, it had never worked. </p><p>His desk is covered in papers, some redacted, all labeled\nProject Rebirth. </p><p>It\u2019s late, or early, depending on how you look at it, and he\u2019s a\nthird of the way through a bottle of scotch, but he has a good feeling about\nthis. The test results on the men who underwent the serum process are\nfrightening; uncontrollable rage, sociopathy, insanity&hellip;in short, a complete\nfailure. </p><p>They have a database of about a hundred applicants for the new\ndrug trials and he has JARVIS run their bloodwork and psych panel against the\ndata from Rebirth, searching for a good match, but everyone involved so far\nshows little compatibility for the process. </p><p>He tasks JARVIS with running the serum against Rhodey\u2019s blood to\nsee if it can stop the virus only to be served crushing defeat when it does\nnothing. He searches the SI medical records for any employee or patient that\nmight be a good match for the serum and in the intervening time works with\nengineers on the construction of the clinic, hires a host of new doctors,\npsychiatrists and researchers, and spends far too much time thinking about\nPeter Parker. </p><p>He\u2019s avoided reaching out, recalling all too easily the look on\nhis face at the Gala, the way he had shied away from Tony\u2019s touch and each\ntime, it hits him like a punch to the gut. </p><p>After Rhodey\u2019s revelation he\u2019d spilled his own secrets to his\nbest friend; how he had discovered his weapons in the hands of the Ten Rings,\nhow he and Peter had agreed to work together to find out how they got them, how\nhe felt about Peter.</p><p>He shows Rhodey Peter\u2019s articles on Vietnam, tells him about his\ngrit and determination and how his eyes look like honey in the moonlight and\ncomes to a very startling realization; he <i>likes</i>\nPeter. Genuinely and without reservation. </p><p>He\u2019s the most honest and morally upstanding man Tony\u2019s ever met,\nincluding Rhodey and for the first time he finds himself caring what someone\nelse thinks about him. There\u2019s been a handful(three\u2014four if you count Howard,\nand he hasn\u2019t since he was 10 and too experienced in all the ways a father\ncould disappoint and hurt) of people he valued the opinion of, and somehow, in\na short time, Peter had made his way onto that list. </p><p>\u201cSir, I have found someone with whom initial tests show the\nserum would be a success.\u201d</p><p>Surprised, Tony looks up from where he\u2019s working on the boot\nthrusters for the new suit, \u201cReally? Pull it up, I want to see,\u201d he orders,\nsitting up straight and wincing as his back protests. JARVIS shows him the\nmedical file of one Steven Grant Rogers, birthplace Brooklyn, age 26 years. His\nbrows rise at the list of medical issues, mouth pursing as he reads. </p><p>\u201cAsthma, 100 pounds, anemia, arrhythmia, Jesus JARVIS this guy\nisn\u2019t a candidate, he\u2019d never survive!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to the initial scan of his blood and a virtual test\nof the serum, he is the ideal candidate.\u201d</p><p>Tony frowns at the hologram and sighs, maybe if he can\u2019t cure\nAIDS or treat it with the serum he can at least improve this guy\u2019s life. He\nflips through the data until he finds the address and phone number listed for\nthe kid, noting the names also listed at that address\u2014Peggy Carter and James\nBarnes. </p><p>The names ring in his memory all day as he works on the suit and\ncomposes a letter, inviting the kid to come and receive treatment, and it\u2019s as\nhe\u2019s working on the capsule designed to administer the serum that they finally\nsink in. </p><p><i>Peggy, Barnes, Steve. </i></p><p>These are Peter\u2019s friends. </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Bucky frowns at the letter he\u2019s just been handed by a courier,\nbrows furrowing at the label indicating it\u2019s from Stark Industries. Sliding a\nfinger under the seal he pulls a letter free and reads, brows rising with each\nmoment until he calls out breathlessly for Peggy. </p><p>She\u2019s at his side a moment later, taking the letter he offers\nher, watching as her eyes widen and her breath catches. Her hand shakes as she\nleans into him, hopeful tears in her eyes. </p><p>\u201cWe have to tell Steve,\u201d she whispers. </p><p>He nods and swallows hard because this, this could change\neverything for them. </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Peter hears about the offer from Stark two days later and isn\u2019t\nsure if he\u2019s shocked or amazed, too numb at the moment to really be sure what he\u2019s\nfeeling. Peggy and Bucky and Steve have already met with Stark and have heard\nall the risks and benefits now it\u2019s up to Steve to decide. </p><p>Still, Peter can\u2019t get it out of his head, this generosity, the\nthings the trio had said about Stark; how he had looked exhausted, how\nbeseechingly he had asked if he could help, how earnest he had been in his\nassurances that there would be no cost\u2014that the only thing he wanted was to use\nSteve\u2019s results in future research. </p><p>It\u2019s late when Peter decides to go see Stark, too many questions\nleft unanswered for his journalistic leanings. He takes a taxi to the tower and\nstares up at it for a long moment before heading inside, palms clammy as he\nsmiles weakly at the security guards. He\u2019s painfully out of place in this\nmarble and gold lobby, jeans ripped at the knees and shirt stained by grease\nfrom where he\u2019s been working on the motorcycle, but hopefully they won\u2019t think\nhe\u2019s crazy when he asks to see Stark. </p><p>\u201cUm, Peter Parker to see Tony Stark,\u201d he says hopefully,\nuncertainly. The guard lifts a brow but dutifully places a call, speaking\nsoftly to whomever is on the line, brows rising in shock before he nods and\nhangs up. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark is in his lab. Take the fourth elevator to the 83rd\nfloor and wait for Jarvis to give you entry.\u201d</p><p>Peter nods and steps through the gate, shuffling nervously as he\nwaits for the elevator, glancing over his shoulder to where the men are\nspeaking quietly and glancing over at him in interest. The doors slide open\nwith a ding and he steps in, presses the button for the 83rd floor and inhales\nsharply when the doors close and the elevator slides up smoothly. He runs his\nhands through his hair when he sees his reflection, grease smudged and tired,\nhair mussed and untidy, grimacing as he imagines what Aunt May would have to\nsay about his appearance. </p><p>The doors slide open again and he steps out, glancing around\ncautiously before heading for the large steel door, eyeing the keypad and some\nsort of scanner beside it that he thinks is likely for a thumbprint. </p><p>Glances around for some sign this Jarvis person is around and\nfrowns when he sees nothing but steel doors lining the hallway and no sign of\nanother human being except for the faint thrum of a heavy bassline thumping\nfrom behind this door. </p><p>\u201cMr. Parker, please place your thumb on the scanner.\u201d</p><p>Whirling, he stares around the hallway wide eyed, heart racing.\nThere\u2019s no one there.</p><p>\u201cMy apologies Mr. Parker, I am JARVIS&ndash;the Artificial Intelligence\nthat runs Stark Tower. Please place your thumb on the scanner.\u201d</p><p>Peter looks up toward the ceiling and spots the speakers that\nthe disembodied voice seems to be coming from and nods unsteadily, \u201cRight of\ncourse. Artificial Intelligence. That makes sense,\u201d he says weakly, reaching\nout to press his thumb to the scanner. This kind of technology shouldn\u2019t exist\nhe thinks, not yet anyway. Everything he\u2019s studied has said that a functional\nAI is still at least a decade away, yet here one is, talking and opening doors\nand controlling an entire building and yea, okay, he\u2019s a little freaked out. </p><p>The door opens in front of him and he steps through uncertainly,\nheading toward the sound of rock music and a blowtorch crackling, peering\naround the corner as he gets closer. What greets him is the sight of Tony Stark\nin a black tank top, arms sweaty and bare, flexing in the light as he works,\ngrease and dirt smudged over his skin and <i>wow</i>&hellip;that\nsure is something. </p><p>Swallowing hard, he approaches slowly, watching as Tony works,\nsteady handed and focused and it\u2019s hotter than it has any right to be, seeing\nhim like this. When he\u2019s a foot away from the workbench Tony looks up and\njolts, fumbling with the torch for a moment before shutting it off and tugging\nhis goggles up and off. </p><p>They stare at each other for a long silent moment. </p><p>\u201cSir, Mr. Parker is here.\u201d</p><p>Tony snorts and rolls his eyes, \u201cGeez, you think J?\u201d</p><p>The sarcasm breaks the uneasy air and Peter shifts, searching\nfor the right words, but Tony gets there first. </p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t expecting to see you anytime soon,\u201d he admits, reaching\nfor a rag to wipe his hands off. \u201cWhat can I do for you Mr. Parker?\u201d he asks,\nand the disinterest in his voice hurts more than Peter expected. </p><p>His throat is thick for a moment and he ducks his head,\nstruggling with the anger and betrayal he still feels over Gulmira and sets it\nagainst this amazing gift Steve is being offered. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what you\u2019re offering to do for Steve,\u201d he murmurs, \u201cI&hellip;I\ncan\u2019t thank you enough,\u201d he stammers, cheeks flushing when Tony just stares at\nhim, expression bordering on apathetic. \u201cI was, I was hoping you might tell me\na little more about this treatment?\u201d he asks, \u201cPeggy and Bucky didn\u2019t really\nget into detail what it was, said you had asked them to be discrete.\u201d</p><p>Tony nods slowly, arms still crossed over his chest and Peter\u2019s\nstomach flutters when he lifts a hand to rub at his goatee, bicep flexing\ndistractingly. \u201cIs this on the record?\u201d he asks coldly, gaze flickering over\nPeter\u2019s shoulder, as though he doesn\u2019t even want to make eye contact and\nPeter\u2019s stomach plunges through the floor. </p><p>\u201cNo, no, of course not,\u201d he assures the older man, \u201cI just, I\nwanted to know what the process would entail. Steve is one of my best friends;\nhe and Peggy and Bucky are like family and I just want to make sure he\u2019s going\nto be safe if he does this.\u201d</p><p>Tony makes a soft noise and shakes his head, running a hand\nthrough his hair and Peter\u2019s gaze tracks the movement, watching as his muscles\nflex and his skin ripples. Lust and want burn into his belly and he glances\naway, flushing. He shouldn\u2019t&hellip;he\u2019s supposed to be angry with Tony, but this\noffer to Steve has tilted his worldview. </p><p>If he\u2019s the kind of man who would build a clinic to treat those\nsick from AIDS and HIV and offer this thing to Steve that will make him a new,\nstronger man, then maybe he <i>isn\u2019t</i> the\nman who would sell his weapons to terrorists. It was sort of unbelievable\nanyway, after what he\u2019d been through, but seeing the destruction first hand had\nbeen hard to ignore and nearly impossible to process. </p><p>\u201cJARVIS, bring up the trial test of Mr. Rogers\u2019 blood and the\nserum, including all files on Project Rebirth and declassify for Mr. Parker.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a moment of silence and Peter glances around\nuncertainly, wondering what the AI is going to do and then suddenly there\u2019s a\nglowing blue hologram in front of him showing blood tests, strings of chemical\nequations and pages upon pages of reports from Project Rebirth and he\u2019s utterly\nbreathless. </p><p>Tony steps forward, shoulder nudging Peter\u2019s as he lifts a hand\nand flips through the pages, \u201cLike this,\u201d he murmurs, showing Peter how to\nflip, zoom and move things around. He steps back and waves a hand, \u201cTake a\nlook.\u201d</p><p>Peter swallows hard and moves forward, studying the blood\nchemistry and the makeup of the serum, gaze flickering over the test results\nand the pages of information, eyes widening as he realizes just what this could\ndo to Steve. </p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like it worked on any of the previous test\nsubjects,\u201d he murmurs, frowning deeply when he reads how many went insane, died\nduring testing or never even passed qualifications. </p><p>\u201cYea, well, this is technology from forty years ago. With what\nwe know now about psychology and human biology, JARVIS and I are 98.7% sure\nthat the serum will work as designed.\u201d</p><p>Peter lifts a brow and flips another page, \u201cAnd if it doesn\u2019t?\u201d\nhe asks softly. </p><p>\u201cAs I explained to your friends, if anything happens to Mr.\nRogers I\u2019ll pay all his medical expenses for the rest of his life, any funeral\ncosts, and provide a lifetime allowance for Ms. Carter and Mr. Barnes. It\u2019s\nnowhere near enough to make up for the loss of a loved one, but it\u2019s what I can\noffer.\u201d</p><p>Peter hums in agreement and continues reading in silence,\nletting all the information sink in and process. His head spins with formulas\nand equations, and once it quiets, he realizes that he has no idea how much\ntime has passed with him just standing here. Turning, he\u2019s surprised to find\nTony back at his work table, head bent over what appears to be a technical\ndrawing. </p><p>Taking a few steps closer, he peers down and frowns; this looks\nlike weaponry&hellip;far more advanced than anything SI has produced so far and his\nstomach turns, blood going icy. </p><p>\u201cThis was all a ruse, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d he whispers in disbelief, \u201cA\nway for you to look good to the media before unveiling whatever this new weapon\nis and making even more money on death.\u201d</p><p>Tony looks up stunned, glances down at the sketch and blanches.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s, it\u2019s not what you think,\u201d he insists. He rises half out of his chair\nas Peter steps away, waving him off, anger surging through his veins once more.\n</p><p>\u201cForget it Stark. I should have known better,\u201d he snaps. </p><p>\u201cJARVIS, bring up Project TI22,\u201d he orders, stumbling over the\nstool to hurry in front of Peter, hands raised placatingly. \u201cListen, Peter,\njust, please look,\u201d he pleads, holding a hand out as his dark eyes gleam with\nuncertainty. </p><p>Peter stares up at him for a long moment before turning back,\nbrow furrowing as he takes in what\u2019s before him. It\u2019s a suit of some kind,\nenormous and weighted down with bulky weapons and in the corner of the\nholographic he sees the word MARK I. </p><p>\u201cThis is how I escaped in Iraq. I took the weapons they gave me\nto build the Jericho and built this instead with Yinsen. It was supposed to get\nus both free but he sacrificed himself to make sure I had enough time to finish\nthe suit and I wouldn\u2019t have made it if he hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Peter steps into the hologram, toying with the specs, studying\neach piece individually and together with the whole of the suit before he looks\nback and shakes his head, incredulous. \u201cYou did this in a <i>cave</i>,\u201d he murmurs, astounded. </p><p>Tony grins weakly, \u201cGenius,\u201d he replies, pointing to himself,\nand Peter laughs, sharp and unexpected, because, yea, only a genius <i>could</i> build something this incredible in\na cave. Tony takes a hesitant step forward and lifts a hand, swipes the MARK I\naway and with another swipe brings up more drawings and schematics for\nsomething labeled MARK II. \u201cThis is what I\u2019m building now. I\u2019m going to use it\nto hunt down the Ten Rings and destroy any of my weapons that they still have.\nI won\u2019t let my weapons fall into the wrong hands again,\u201d he vows. </p><p>Peter looks between the schematics and Tony\u2019s hopeful face,\ntakes a slow, hesitant step toward him as a smile works its way across his face\nand joy blooms in his face. He\u2019s half a foot from Tony as he stares up at him,\nstudying the lines around his eyes and the exhaustion on his face and it occurs\nto him suddenly that he\u2019s close enough that if he just leaned up a bit, he\ncould kiss Tony. </p><p>\u201cI promise, this is the only weapon I\u2019ll ever design again. It\u2019s\nmy responsibility to fix what my company did, to try and make things right.\u201d\nTony gazes down at him intently, hand hovering by his side for a moment before\nhe reaches out and wraps his fingers around Peter\u2019s wrist and the heat of them\nsears into his skin, leaves his pulse rocketing and his cheeks pink.</p><p>\u201cI swear Peter, you can trust me.\u201d</p><p>Peter nods slowly and twists his wrist free, turns his hand so\nit can take Tony\u2019s and squeeze. </p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>Ohhhh man, our boys are getting closer!! Can you feel the mutual longing?\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://starkercrossedlovers.tumblr.com/post/183694060037/love-other-drugs-ch-1-fortunate-son\" draggable=\"false\">Ch 1</a></p><p><a

Have them\nsend a soda too, root beer please.\u201d</p><p>JARVIS confirms the order and goes back to running trials on the\ndrug Tony\u2019s been trying to develop as a cure for AIDS, but he\u2019s no biochemist,\nso most of this is guess work and it drives him a little crazier every time an\niteration fails. </p><p>He stands and stretches, groans as his muscles protest. He\u2019s\ntired but has no real drive to sleep, not when he could be working on this. Not\nnow that it\u2019s life and death for the most important person in his life. Now\nit\u2019s up to him to keep Rhodey healthy while he searches for a way to cure him\nor treat him, anything to make sure he doesn\u2019t become one of the thousands that\nhave already died because of this disease. </p><p>With more data sets he could see how the drug he\u2019s testing is\nworking on different patients, but it\u2019s not like he has access to that many\npeople with AIDS. Pausing, he stands and breathes as an idea takes form. He\nlets it sink in and grow and then exhales unsteadily, excitement rising within\nhim.</p><p>\u201cJARVIS, contact Pepper and get her here. I\u2019ll also need the\nname of a biochemist and molecular engineer. Check and see if Bruce Banner is\nworking with any organizations, it\u2019s been a few years since we\u2019ve talked but he\nmight have a recommendation.

What shall we call the project sir?\u201d</p><p>Tony grins. </p><p>\u201cProject Blue Sky.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>Peter huffs in disappointment, hanging up the phone after yet\nanother fruitless call to Stark Industries. Pepper hasn\u2019t been the font of\ninformation he\u2019s been hoping for, despite their sort of friendship and her\nbudding relationship with MJ. She\u2019s been polite but distant, insisting that she\ndoesn\u2019t know anything about how the Stark weapons ended up in the hands of the\nTen Rings, and surprisingly, he believes her. </p><p>To his even greater disappointment, Peggy hasn\u2019t turned anything\nup either\u2014her resources within Iraq are limited and to get that kind of\ninformation would require her longest term asset to break cover, something\nshe\u2019d told him she couldn\u2019t do. </p><p>So he\u2019s back to square one. </p><p>He hasn\u2019t seen or heard from Stark(and he has to think of him as\nStark because Tony is the man who had bandaged his hand and nearly kissed him\nin the moonlight and he can\u2019t think of him like that because it hurts too much)\nin the weeks since he confronted him at the Gala, but he\u2019s read the articles on\nStark Industries and the new changes he\u2019s been implementing. Clean energy,\ninternet access for the masses, investment in medical technology and\npharmaceuticals, and a new clinic for AIDS and HIV patients have all taken the\ncity and the economy by storm. </p><p>He tries not to watch the interviews Stark does, stays silent at\nthe press gaggles and avoids eye contact when the older man\u2019s gaze flickers\nover the crowds, always searching for him, but he can\u2019t avoid him forever, he\nknows that. At some point he\u2019ll have to speak to him because Jameson is growing\nangrier each time he comes back without a quote for the paper. </p><p>Sighing, he glances at the clock and turns his attention back to\nhis article on the Hudson River cleanup effort\u2014if he can get it done and to the\ncopy editor before five he\u2019ll be able to head out early and avoid the traffic\non his way downtown. Steve had finally gotten a job at a local art gallery,\nteaching an introductory class three times a week and tonight is their first\nshow of the student\u2019s art. </p><p>It\u2019s a quarter to five when he finishes, giving him just enough\ntime to stop at a flower stand and buy a few bundles of faded roses for the\nstudents. He hails a cab and sits back, watching the skyline change as they\ndrive, heart lurching when the familiar shape of Stark Tower passes by,\nthrowing a shadow onto the road below. </p><p>He think how much like the tower Tony is; larger than life,\ninfamous, untouchable. </p><p>Swallowing through a thick throat, he turns away and focuses on\nthe signs and faces slipping by. </p><p>It\u2019s just another building in a city full to overflowing with\ntoo many people and not enough heart. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>The clinic won\u2019t be on its feet for another month so Tony\u2019s\nreduced to searching through his father\u2019s old files, searching for anything\nthat might help. He\u2019s heard the stories of the men his father had worked with\nduring WWII, trying to create an enhanced super soldier, but as he had heard\nover and over again, it had never worked. </p><p>His desk is covered in papers, some redacted, all labeled\nProject Rebirth. </p><p>It\u2019s late, or early, depending on how you look at it, and he\u2019s a\nthird of the way through a bottle of scotch, but he has a good feeling about\nthis. The test results on the men who underwent the serum process are\nfrightening; uncontrollable rage, sociopathy, insanity\u2026in short, a complete\nfailure. </p><p>They have a database of about a hundred applicants for the new\ndrug trials and he has JARVIS run their bloodwork and psych panel against the\ndata from Rebirth, searching for a good match, but everyone involved so far\nshows little compatibility for the process. </p><p>He tasks JARVIS with running the serum against Rhodey\u2019s blood to\nsee if it can stop the virus only to be served crushing defeat when it does\nnothing. He searches the SI medical records for any employee or patient that\nmight be a good match for the serum and in the intervening time works with\nengineers on the construction of the clinic, hires a host of new doctors,\npsychiatrists and researchers, and spends far too much time thinking about\nPeter Parker. </p><p>He\u2019s avoided reaching out, recalling all too easily the look on\nhis face at the Gala, the way he had shied away from Tony\u2019s touch and each\ntime, it hits him like a punch to the gut. </p><p>After Rhodey\u2019s revelation he\u2019d spilled his own secrets to his\nbest friend; how he had discovered his weapons in the hands of the Ten Rings,\nhow he and Peter had agreed to work together to find out how they got them, how\nhe felt about Peter.</p><p>He shows Rhodey Peter\u2019s articles on Vietnam, tells him about his\ngrit and determination and how his eyes look like honey in the moonlight and\ncomes to a very startling realization; he <i>likes</i>\nPeter. Genuinely and without reservation. </p><p>He\u2019s the most honest and morally upstanding man Tony\u2019s ever met,\nincluding Rhodey and for the first time he finds himself caring what someone\nelse thinks about him. There\u2019s been a handful(three\u2014four if you count Howard,\nand he hasn\u2019t since he was 10 and too experienced in all the ways a father\ncould disappoint and hurt) of people he valued the opinion of, and somehow, in\na short time, Peter had made his way onto that list. </p><p>\u201cSir, I have found someone with whom initial tests show the\nserum would be a success.\u201d</p><p>Surprised, Tony looks up from where he\u2019s working on the boot\nthrusters for the new suit, \u201cReally? Pull it up, I want to see,\u201d he orders,\nsitting up straight and wincing as his back protests. JARVIS shows him the\nmedical file of one Steven Grant Rogers, birthplace Brooklyn, age 26 years. His\nbrows rise at the list of medical issues, mouth pursing as he reads. </p><p>\u201cAsthma, 100 pounds, anemia, arrhythmia, Jesus JARVIS this guy\nisn\u2019t a candidate, he\u2019d never survive!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to the initial scan of his blood and a virtual test\nof the serum, he is the ideal candidate.\u201d</p><p>Tony frowns at the hologram and sighs, maybe if he can\u2019t cure\nAIDS or treat it with the serum he can at least improve this guy\u2019s life. He\nflips through the data until he finds the address and phone number listed for\nthe kid, noting the names also listed at that address\u2014Peggy Carter and James\nBarnes. </p><p>The names ring in his memory all day as he works on the suit and\ncomposes a letter, inviting the kid to come and receive treatment, and it\u2019s as\nhe\u2019s working on the capsule designed to administer the serum that they finally\nsink in. </p><p><i>Peggy, Barnes, Steve. </i></p><p>These are Peter\u2019s friends. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Bucky frowns at the letter he\u2019s just been handed by a courier,\nbrows furrowing at the label indicating it\u2019s from Stark Industries. Sliding a\nfinger under the seal he pulls a letter free and reads, brows rising with each\nmoment until he calls out breathlessly for Peggy. </p><p>She\u2019s at his side a moment later, taking the letter he offers\nher, watching as her eyes widen and her breath catches. Her hand shakes as she\nleans into him, hopeful tears in her eyes. </p><p>\u201cWe have to tell Steve,\u201d she whispers. </p><p>He nods and swallows hard because this, this could change\neverything for them. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Peter hears about the offer from Stark two days later and isn\u2019t\nsure if he\u2019s shocked or amazed, too numb at the moment to really be sure what he\u2019s\nfeeling. Peggy and Bucky and Steve have already met with Stark and have heard\nall the risks and benefits now it\u2019s up to Steve to decide. </p><p>Still, Peter can\u2019t get it out of his head, this generosity, the\nthings the trio had said about Stark; how he had looked exhausted, how\nbeseechingly he had asked if he could help, how earnest he had been in his\nassurances that there would be no cost\u2014that the only thing he wanted was to use\nSteve\u2019s results in future research. </p><p>It\u2019s late when Peter decides to go see Stark, too many questions\nleft unanswered for his journalistic leanings. He takes a taxi to the tower and\nstares up at it for a long moment before heading inside, palms clammy as he\nsmiles weakly at the security guards. He\u2019s painfully out of place in this\nmarble and gold lobby, jeans ripped at the knees and shirt stained by grease\nfrom where he\u2019s been working on the motorcycle, but hopefully they won\u2019t think\nhe\u2019s crazy when he asks to see Stark. </p><p>\u201cUm, Peter Parker to see Tony Stark,\u201d he says hopefully,\nuncertainly. The guard lifts a brow but dutifully places a call, speaking\nsoftly to whomever is on the line, brows rising in shock before he nods and\nhangs up. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark is in his lab. Take the fourth elevator to the 83rd\nfloor and wait for Jarvis to give you entry.\u201d</p><p>Peter nods and steps through the gate, shuffling nervously as he\nwaits for the elevator, glancing over his shoulder to where the men are\nspeaking quietly and glancing over at him in interest. The doors slide open\nwith a ding and he steps in, presses the button for the 83rd floor and inhales\nsharply when the doors close and the elevator slides up smoothly. He runs his\nhands through his hair when he sees his reflection, grease smudged and tired,\nhair mussed and untidy, grimacing as he imagines what Aunt May would have to\nsay about his appearance. </p><p>The doors slide open again and he steps out, glancing around\ncautiously before heading for the large steel door, eyeing the keypad and some\nsort of scanner beside it that he thinks is likely for a thumbprint. </p><p>Glances around for some sign this Jarvis person is around and\nfrowns when he sees nothing but steel doors lining the hallway and no sign of\nanother human being except for the faint thrum of a heavy bassline thumping\nfrom behind this door. </p><p>\u201cMr. Parker, please place your thumb on the scanner.\u201d</p><p>Whirling, he stares around the hallway wide eyed, heart racing.\nThere\u2019s no one there.</p><p>\u201cMy apologies Mr. Parker, I am JARVIS\u2013the Artificial Intelligence\nthat runs Stark Tower. Please place your thumb on the scanner.\u201d</p><p>Peter looks up toward the ceiling and spots the speakers that\nthe disembodied voice seems to be coming from and nods unsteadily, \u201cRight of\ncourse. Artificial Intelligence. That makes sense,\u201d he says weakly, reaching\nout to press his thumb to the scanner. This kind of technology shouldn\u2019t exist\nhe thinks, not yet anyway. Everything he\u2019s studied has said that a functional\nAI is still at least a decade away, yet here one is, talking and opening doors\nand controlling an entire building and yea, okay, he\u2019s a little freaked out. </p><p>The door opens in front of him and he steps through uncertainly,\nheading toward the sound of rock music and a blowtorch crackling, peering\naround the corner as he gets closer. What greets him is the sight of Tony Stark\nin a black tank top, arms sweaty and bare, flexing in the light as he works,\ngrease and dirt smudged over his skin and <i>wow</i>\u2026that\nsure is something. </p><p>Swallowing hard, he approaches slowly, watching as Tony works,\nsteady handed and focused and it\u2019s hotter than it has any right to be, seeing\nhim like this. When he\u2019s a foot away from the workbench Tony looks up and\njolts, fumbling with the torch for a moment before shutting it off and tugging\nhis goggles up and off. </p><p>They stare at each other for a long silent moment. </p><p>\u201cSir, Mr. Parker is here.\u201d</p><p>Tony snorts and rolls his eyes, \u201cGeez, you think J?\u201d</p><p>The sarcasm breaks the uneasy air and Peter shifts, searching\nfor the right words, but Tony gets there first. </p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t expecting to see you anytime soon,\u201d he admits, reaching\nfor a rag to wipe his hands off. \u201cWhat can I do for you Mr. Parker?\u201d he asks,\nand the disinterest in his voice hurts more than Peter expected. </p><p>His throat is thick for a moment and he ducks his head,\nstruggling with the anger and betrayal he still feels over Gulmira and sets it\nagainst this amazing gift Steve is being offered. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what you\u2019re offering to do for Steve,\u201d he murmurs, \u201cI\u2026I\ncan\u2019t thank you enough,\u201d he stammers, cheeks flushing when Tony just stares at\nhim, expression bordering on apathetic. \u201cI was, I was hoping you might tell me\na little more about this treatment?\u201d he asks, \u201cPeggy and Bucky didn\u2019t really\nget into detail what it was, said you had asked them to be discrete.\u201d</p><p>Tony nods slowly, arms still crossed over his chest and Peter\u2019s\nstomach flutters when he lifts a hand to rub at his goatee, bicep flexing\ndistractingly. \u201cIs this on the record?\u201d he asks coldly, gaze flickering over\nPeter\u2019s shoulder, as though he doesn\u2019t even want to make eye contact and\nPeter\u2019s stomach plunges through the floor. </p><p>\u201cNo, no, of course not,\u201d he assures the older man, \u201cI just, I\nwanted to know what the process would entail. Steve is one of my best friends;\nhe and Peggy and Bucky are like family and I just want to make sure he\u2019s going\nto be safe if he does this.\u201d</p><p>Tony makes a soft noise and shakes his head, running a hand\nthrough his hair and Peter\u2019s gaze tracks the movement, watching as his muscles\nflex and his skin ripples. Lust and want burn into his belly and he glances\naway, flushing. He shouldn\u2019t\u2026he\u2019s supposed to be angry with Tony, but this\noffer to Steve has tilted his worldview. </p><p>If he\u2019s the kind of man who would build a clinic to treat those\nsick from AIDS and HIV and offer this thing to Steve that will make him a new,\nstronger man, then maybe he <i>isn\u2019t</i> the\nman who would sell his weapons to terrorists. It was sort of unbelievable\nanyway, after what he\u2019d been through, but seeing the destruction first hand had\nbeen hard to ignore and nearly impossible to process. </p><p>\u201cJARVIS, bring up the trial test of Mr. Rogers\u2019 blood and the\nserum, including all files on Project Rebirth and declassify for Mr. Parker.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a moment of silence and Peter glances around\nuncertainly, wondering what the AI is going to do and then suddenly there\u2019s a\nglowing blue hologram in front of him showing blood tests, strings of chemical\nequations and pages upon pages of reports from Project Rebirth and he\u2019s utterly\nbreathless. </p><p>Tony steps forward, shoulder nudging Peter\u2019s as he lifts a hand\nand flips through the pages, \u201cLike this,\u201d he murmurs, showing Peter how to\nflip, zoom and move things around. He steps back and waves a hand, \u201cTake a\nlook.\u201d</p><p>Peter swallows hard and moves forward, studying the blood\nchemistry and the makeup of the serum, gaze flickering over the test results\nand the pages of information, eyes widening as he realizes just what this could\ndo to Steve. </p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like it worked on any of the previous test\nsubjects,\u201d he murmurs, frowning deeply when he reads how many went insane, died\nduring testing or never even passed qualifications. </p><p>\u201cYea, well, this is technology from forty years ago. With what\nwe know now about psychology and human biology, JARVIS and I are 98.7% sure\nthat the serum will work as designed.\u201d</p><p>Peter lifts a brow and flips another page, \u201cAnd if it doesn\u2019t?\u201d\nhe asks softly. </p><p>\u201cAs I explained to your friends, if anything happens to Mr.\nRogers I\u2019ll pay all his medical expenses for the rest of his life, any funeral\ncosts, and provide a lifetime allowance for Ms. Carter and Mr. Barnes. It\u2019s\nnowhere near enough to make up for the loss of a loved one, but it\u2019s what I can\noffer.\u201d</p><p>Peter hums in agreement and continues reading in silence,\nletting all the information sink in and process. His head spins with formulas\nand equations, and once it quiets, he realizes that he has no idea how much\ntime has passed with him just standing here. Turning, he\u2019s surprised to find\nTony back at his work table, head bent over what appears to be a technical\ndrawing. </p><p>Taking a few steps closer, he peers down and frowns; this looks\nlike weaponry\u2026far more advanced than anything SI has produced so far and his\nstomach turns, blood going icy. </p><p>\u201cThis was all a ruse, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d he whispers in disbelief, \u201cA\nway for you to look good to the media before unveiling whatever this new weapon\nis and making even more money on death.\u201d</p><p>Tony looks up stunned, glances down at the sketch and blanches.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s, it\u2019s not what you think,\u201d he insists. He rises half out of his chair\nas Peter steps away, waving him off, anger surging through his veins once more.\n</p><p>\u201cForget it Stark. I should have known better,\u201d he snaps. </p><p>\u201cJARVIS, bring up Project TI22,\u201d he orders, stumbling over the\nstool to hurry in front of Peter, hands raised placatingly. \u201cListen, Peter,\njust, please look,\u201d he pleads, holding a hand out as his dark eyes gleam with\nuncertainty. </p><p>Peter stares up at him for a long moment before turning back,\nbrow furrowing as he takes in what\u2019s before him. It\u2019s a suit of some kind,\nenormous and weighted down with bulky weapons and in the corner of the\nholographic he sees the word MARK I. </p><p>\u201cThis is how I escaped in Iraq. I took the weapons they gave me\nto build the Jericho and built this instead with Yinsen. It was supposed to get\nus both free but he sacrificed himself to make sure I had enough time to finish\nthe suit and I wouldn\u2019t have made it if he hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Peter steps into the hologram, toying with the specs, studying\neach piece individually and together with the whole of the suit before he looks\nback and shakes his head, incredulous. \u201cYou did this in a <i>cave</i>,\u201d he murmurs, astounded. </p><p>Tony grins weakly, \u201cGenius,\u201d he replies, pointing to himself,\nand Peter laughs, sharp and unexpected, because, yea, only a genius <i>could</i> build something this incredible in\na cave. Tony takes a hesitant step forward and lifts a hand, swipes the MARK I\naway and with another swipe brings up more drawings and schematics for\nsomething labeled MARK II. \u201cThis is what I\u2019m building now. I\u2019m going to use it\nto hunt down the Ten Rings and destroy any of my weapons that they still have.\nI won\u2019t let my weapons fall into the wrong hands again,\u201d he vows. </p><p>Peter looks between the schematics and Tony\u2019s hopeful face,\ntakes a slow, hesitant step toward him as a smile works its way across his face\nand joy blooms in his face. He\u2019s half a foot from Tony as he stares up at him,\nstudying the lines around his eyes and the exhaustion on his face and it occurs\nto him suddenly that he\u2019s close enough that if he just leaned up a bit, he\ncould kiss Tony. </p><p>\u201cI promise, this is the only weapon I\u2019ll ever design again. It\u2019s\nmy responsibility to fix what my company did, to try and make things right.\u201d\nTony gazes down at him intently, hand hovering by his side for a moment before\nhe reaches out and wraps his fingers around Peter\u2019s wrist and the heat of them\nsears into his skin, leaves his pulse rocketing and his cheeks pink.</p><p>\u201cI swear Peter, you can trust me.\u201d</p><p>Peter nods slowly and twists his wrist free, turns his hand so\nit can take Tony\u2019s and squeeze. </p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>Ohhhh man, our boys are getting closer!!

Keep going,\u201d he orders. \u201cMake note of any useful data and apply\nit moving forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes sir. Might I suggest a break sir? It\u2019s been 18 hours since\nyour last meal.\u201d</p><p>Tony shifts in his seat and rolls his shoulders, \u201cYea, sure,\norder a sandwich from the kitchen. Turkey and bacon on rye. No onion. Have them\nsend a soda too, root beer please.\u201d</p><p>JARVIS confirms the order and goes back to running trials on the\ndrug Tony\u2019s been trying to develop as a cure for AIDS, but he\u2019s no biochemist,\nso most of this is guess work and it drives him a little crazier every time an\niteration fails. </p><p>He stands and stretches, groans as his muscles protest. He\u2019s\ntired but has no real drive to sleep, not when he could be working on this. Not\nnow that it\u2019s life and death for the most important person in his life. Now\nit\u2019s up to him to keep Rhodey healthy while he searches for a way to cure him\nor treat him, anything to make sure he doesn\u2019t become one of the thousands that\nhave already died because of this disease. </p><p>With more data sets he could see how the drug he\u2019s testing is\nworking on different patients, but it\u2019s not like he has access to that many\npeople with AIDS. Pausing, he stands and breathes as an idea takes form. He\nlets it sink in and grow and then exhales unsteadily, excitement rising within\nhim.</p><p>\u201cJARVIS, contact Pepper and get her here. I\u2019ll also need the\nname of a biochemist and molecular engineer. Check and see if Bruce Banner is\nworking with any organizations, it\u2019s been a few years since we\u2019ve talked but he\nmight have a recommendation. Is there anyone at SI qualified?\u201d</p><p>He paces as he asks questions, mind whirling a mile a minute.\n\u201cGet me Rhodey after Pepper and start a new project,\u201d he orders, grin growing\nwith each second that passes. </p><p>\u201cVery good sir, Miss Potts has been notified and is on her way,\nestimated time of arrival, 2:33pm. What shall we call the project sir?\u201d</p><p>Tony grins. </p><p>\u201cProject Blue Sky.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>Peter huffs in disappointment, hanging up the phone after yet\nanother fruitless call to Stark Industries. Pepper hasn\u2019t been the font of\ninformation he\u2019s been hoping for, despite their sort of friendship and her\nbudding relationship with MJ. She\u2019s been polite but distant, insisting that she\ndoesn\u2019t know anything about how the Stark weapons ended up in the hands of the\nTen Rings, and surprisingly, he believes her. </p><p>To his even greater disappointment, Peggy hasn\u2019t turned anything\nup either\u2014her resources within Iraq are limited and to get that kind of\ninformation would require her longest term asset to break cover, something\nshe\u2019d told him she couldn\u2019t do. </p><p>So he\u2019s back to square one. </p><p>He hasn\u2019t seen or heard from Stark(and he has to think of him as\nStark because Tony is the man who had bandaged his hand and nearly kissed him\nin the moonlight and he can\u2019t think of him like that because it hurts too much)\nin the weeks since he confronted him at the Gala, but he\u2019s read the articles on\nStark Industries and the new changes he\u2019s been implementing. Clean energy,\ninternet access for the masses, investment in medical technology and\npharmaceuticals, and a new clinic for AIDS and HIV patients have all taken the\ncity and the economy by storm. </p><p>He tries not to watch the interviews Stark does, stays silent at\nthe press gaggles and avoids eye contact when the older man\u2019s gaze flickers\nover the crowds, always searching for him, but he can\u2019t avoid him forever, he\nknows that. At some point he\u2019ll have to speak to him because Jameson is growing\nangrier each time he comes back without a quote for the paper. </p><p>Sighing, he glances at the clock and turns his attention back to\nhis article on the Hudson River cleanup effort\u2014if he can get it done and to the\ncopy editor before five he\u2019ll be able to head out early and avoid the traffic\non his way downtown. Steve had finally gotten a job at a local art gallery,\nteaching an introductory class three times a week and tonight is their first\nshow of the student\u2019s art. </p><p>It\u2019s a quarter to five when he finishes, giving him just enough\ntime to stop at a flower stand and buy a few bundles of faded roses for the\nstudents. He hails a cab and sits back, watching the skyline change as they\ndrive, heart lurching when the familiar shape of Stark Tower passes by,\nthrowing a shadow onto the road below. </p><p>He think how much like the tower Tony is; larger than life,\ninfamous, untouchable. </p><p>Swallowing through a thick throat, he turns away and focuses on\nthe signs and faces slipping by. </p><p>It\u2019s just another building in a city full to overflowing with\ntoo many people and not enough heart. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>The clinic won\u2019t be on its feet for another month so Tony\u2019s\nreduced to searching through his father\u2019s old files, searching for anything\nthat might help. He\u2019s heard the stories of the men his father had worked with\nduring WWII, trying to create an enhanced super soldier, but as he had heard\nover and over again, it had never worked. </p><p>His desk is covered in papers, some redacted, all labeled\nProject Rebirth. </p><p>It\u2019s late, or early, depending on how you look at it, and he\u2019s a\nthird of the way through a bottle of scotch, but he has a good feeling about\nthis. The test results on the men who underwent the serum process are\nfrightening; uncontrollable rage, sociopathy, insanity\u2026in short, a complete\nfailure. </p><p>They have a database of about a hundred applicants for the new\ndrug trials and he has JARVIS run their bloodwork and psych panel against the\ndata from Rebirth, searching for a good match, but everyone involved so far\nshows little compatibility for the process. </p><p>He tasks JARVIS with running the serum against Rhodey\u2019s blood to\nsee if it can stop the virus only to be served crushing defeat when it does\nnothing. He searches the SI medical records for any employee or patient that\nmight be a good match for the serum and in the intervening time works with\nengineers on the construction of the clinic, hires a host of new doctors,\npsychiatrists and researchers, and spends far too much time thinking about\nPeter Parker. </p><p>He\u2019s avoided reaching out, recalling all too easily the look on\nhis face at the Gala, the way he had shied away from Tony\u2019s touch and each\ntime, it hits him like a punch to the gut. </p><p>After Rhodey\u2019s revelation he\u2019d spilled his own secrets to his\nbest friend; how he had discovered his weapons in the hands of the Ten Rings,\nhow he and Peter had agreed to work together to find out how they got them, how\nhe felt about Peter.</p><p>He shows Rhodey Peter\u2019s articles on Vietnam, tells him about his\ngrit and determination and how his eyes look like honey in the moonlight and\ncomes to a very startling realization; he <i>likes</i>\nPeter. Genuinely and without reservation. </p><p>He\u2019s the most honest and morally upstanding man Tony\u2019s ever met,\nincluding Rhodey and for the first time he finds himself caring what someone\nelse thinks about him. There\u2019s been a handful(three\u2014four if you count Howard,\nand he hasn\u2019t since he was 10 and too experienced in all the ways a father\ncould disappoint and hurt) of people he valued the opinion of, and somehow, in\na short time, Peter had made his way onto that list. </p><p>\u201cSir, I have found someone with whom initial tests show the\nserum would be a success.\u201d</p><p>Surprised, Tony looks up from where he\u2019s working on the boot\nthrusters for the new suit, \u201cReally? Pull it up, I want to see,\u201d he orders,\nsitting up straight and wincing as his back protests. JARVIS shows him the\nmedical file of one Steven Grant Rogers, birthplace Brooklyn, age 26 years. His\nbrows rise at the list of medical issues, mouth pursing as he reads. </p><p>\u201cAsthma, 100 pounds, anemia, arrhythmia, Jesus JARVIS this guy\nisn\u2019t a candidate, he\u2019d never survive!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to the initial scan of his blood and a virtual test\nof the serum, he is the ideal candidate.\u201d</p><p>Tony frowns at the hologram and sighs, maybe if he can\u2019t cure\nAIDS or treat it with the serum he can at least improve this guy\u2019s life. He\nflips through the data until he finds the address and phone number listed for\nthe kid, noting the names also listed at that address\u2014Peggy Carter and James\nBarnes. </p><p>The names ring in his memory all day as he works on the suit and\ncomposes a letter, inviting the kid to come and receive treatment, and it\u2019s as\nhe\u2019s working on the capsule designed to administer the serum that they finally\nsink in. </p><p><i>Peggy, Barnes, Steve. </i></p><p>These are Peter\u2019s friends. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Bucky frowns at the letter he\u2019s just been handed by a courier,\nbrows furrowing at the label indicating it\u2019s from Stark Industries. Sliding a\nfinger under the seal he pulls a letter free and reads, brows rising with each\nmoment until he calls out breathlessly for Peggy. </p><p>She\u2019s at his side a moment later, taking the letter he offers\nher, watching as her eyes widen and her breath catches. Her hand shakes as she\nleans into him, hopeful tears in her eyes. </p><p>\u201cWe have to tell Steve,\u201d she whispers. </p><p>He nods and swallows hard because this, this could change\neverything for them. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Peter hears about the offer from Stark two days later and isn\u2019t\nsure if he\u2019s shocked or amazed, too numb at the moment to really be sure what he\u2019s\nfeeling. Peggy and Bucky and Steve have already met with Stark and have heard\nall the risks and benefits now it\u2019s up to Steve to decide. </p><p>Still, Peter can\u2019t get it out of his head, this generosity, the\nthings the trio had said about Stark; how he had looked exhausted, how\nbeseechingly he had asked if he could help, how earnest he had been in his\nassurances that there would be no cost\u2014that the only thing he wanted was to use\nSteve\u2019s results in future research. </p><p>It\u2019s late when Peter decides to go see Stark, too many questions\nleft unanswered for his journalistic leanings. He takes a taxi to the tower and\nstares up at it for a long moment before heading inside, palms clammy as he\nsmiles weakly at the security guards. He\u2019s painfully out of place in this\nmarble and gold lobby, jeans ripped at the knees and shirt stained by grease\nfrom where he\u2019s been working on the motorcycle, but hopefully they won\u2019t think\nhe\u2019s crazy when he asks to see Stark. </p><p>\u201cUm, Peter Parker to see Tony Stark,\u201d he says hopefully,\nuncertainly. The guard lifts a brow but dutifully places a call, speaking\nsoftly to whomever is on the line, brows rising in shock before he nods and\nhangs up. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark is in his lab. Take the fourth elevator to the 83rd\nfloor and wait for Jarvis to give you entry.\u201d</p><p>Peter nods and steps through the gate, shuffling nervously as he\nwaits for the elevator, glancing over his shoulder to where the men are\nspeaking quietly and glancing over at him in interest. The doors slide open\nwith a ding and he steps in, presses the button for the 83rd floor and inhales\nsharply when the doors close and the elevator slides up smoothly. He runs his\nhands through his hair when he sees his reflection, grease smudged and tired,\nhair mussed and untidy, grimacing as he imagines what Aunt May would have to\nsay about his appearance. </p><p>The doors slide open again and he steps out, glancing around\ncautiously before heading for the large steel door, eyeing the keypad and some\nsort of scanner beside it that he thinks is likely for a thumbprint. </p><p>Glances around for some sign this Jarvis person is around and\nfrowns when he sees nothing but steel doors lining the hallway and no sign of\nanother human being except for the faint thrum of a heavy bassline thumping\nfrom behind this door. </p><p>\u201cMr. Parker, please place your thumb on the scanner.\u201d</p><p>Whirling, he stares around the hallway wide eyed, heart racing.\nThere\u2019s no one there.</p><p>\u201cMy apologies Mr. Parker, I am JARVIS\u2013the Artificial Intelligence\nthat runs Stark Tower. Please place your thumb on the scanner.\u201d</p><p>Peter looks up toward the ceiling and spots the speakers that\nthe disembodied voice seems to be coming from and nods unsteadily, \u201cRight of\ncourse. Artificial Intelligence. That makes sense,\u201d he says weakly, reaching\nout to press his thumb to the scanner. This kind of technology shouldn\u2019t exist\nhe thinks, not yet anyway. Everything he\u2019s studied has said that a functional\nAI is still at least a decade away, yet here one is, talking and opening doors\nand controlling an entire building and yea, okay, he\u2019s a little freaked out. </p><p>The door opens in front of him and he steps through uncertainly,\nheading toward the sound of rock music and a blowtorch crackling, peering\naround the corner as he gets closer. What greets him is the sight of Tony Stark\nin a black tank top, arms sweaty and bare, flexing in the light as he works,\ngrease and dirt smudged over his skin and <i>wow</i>\u2026that\nsure is something. </p><p>Swallowing hard, he approaches slowly, watching as Tony works,\nsteady handed and focused and it\u2019s hotter than it has any right to be, seeing\nhim like this. When he\u2019s a foot away from the workbench Tony looks up and\njolts, fumbling with the torch for a moment before shutting it off and tugging\nhis goggles up and off. </p><p>They stare at each other for a long silent moment. </p><p>\u201cSir, Mr. Parker is here.\u201d</p><p>Tony snorts and rolls his eyes, \u201cGeez, you think J?\u201d</p><p>The sarcasm breaks the uneasy air and Peter shifts, searching\nfor the right words, but Tony gets there first. </p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t expecting to see you anytime soon,\u201d he admits, reaching\nfor a rag to wipe his hands off. \u201cWhat can I do for you Mr. Parker?\u201d he asks,\nand the disinterest in his voice hurts more than Peter expected. </p><p>His throat is thick for a moment and he ducks his head,\nstruggling with the anger and betrayal he still feels over Gulmira and sets it\nagainst this amazing gift Steve is being offered. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what you\u2019re offering to do for Steve,\u201d he murmurs, \u201cI\u2026I\ncan\u2019t thank you enough,\u201d he stammers, cheeks flushing when Tony just stares at\nhim, expression bordering on apathetic. \u201cI was, I was hoping you might tell me\na little more about this treatment?\u201d he asks, \u201cPeggy and Bucky didn\u2019t really\nget into detail what it was, said you had asked them to be discrete.\u201d</p><p>Tony nods slowly, arms still crossed over his chest and Peter\u2019s\nstomach flutters when he lifts a hand to rub at his goatee, bicep flexing\ndistractingly. \u201cIs this on the record?\u201d he asks coldly, gaze flickering over\nPeter\u2019s shoulder, as though he doesn\u2019t even want to make eye contact and\nPeter\u2019s stomach plunges through the floor. </p><p>\u201cNo, no, of course not,\u201d he assures the older man, \u201cI just, I\nwanted to know what the process would entail. Steve is one of my best friends;\nhe and Peggy and Bucky are like family and I just want to make sure he\u2019s going\nto be safe if he does this.\u201d</p><p>Tony makes a soft noise and shakes his head, running a hand\nthrough his hair and Peter\u2019s gaze tracks the movement, watching as his muscles\nflex and his skin ripples. Lust and want burn into his belly and he glances\naway, flushing. He shouldn\u2019t\u2026he\u2019s supposed to be angry with Tony, but this\noffer to Steve has tilted his worldview. </p><p>If he\u2019s the kind of man who would build a clinic to treat those\nsick from AIDS and HIV and offer this thing to Steve that will make him a new,\nstronger man, then maybe he <i>isn\u2019t</i> the\nman who would sell his weapons to terrorists. It was sort of unbelievable\nanyway, after what he\u2019d been through, but seeing the destruction first hand had\nbeen hard to ignore and nearly impossible to process. </p><p>\u201cJARVIS, bring up the trial test of Mr. Rogers\u2019 blood and the\nserum, including all files on Project Rebirth and declassify for Mr. Parker.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a moment of silence and Peter glances around\nuncertainly, wondering what the AI is going to do and then suddenly there\u2019s a\nglowing blue hologram in front of him showing blood tests, strings of chemical\nequations and pages upon pages of reports from Project Rebirth and he\u2019s utterly\nbreathless. </p><p>Tony steps forward, shoulder nudging Peter\u2019s as he lifts a hand\nand flips through the pages, \u201cLike this,\u201d he murmurs, showing Peter how to\nflip, zoom and move things around. He steps back and waves a hand, \u201cTake a\nlook.\u201d</p><p>Peter swallows hard and moves forward, studying the blood\nchemistry and the makeup of the serum, gaze flickering over the test results\nand the pages of information, eyes widening as he realizes just what this could\ndo to Steve. </p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like it worked on any of the previous test\nsubjects,\u201d he murmurs, frowning deeply when he reads how many went insane, died\nduring testing or never even passed qualifications. </p><p>\u201cYea, well, this is technology from forty years ago. With what\nwe know now about psychology and human biology, JARVIS and I are 98.7% sure\nthat the serum will work as designed.\u201d</p><p>Peter lifts a brow and flips another page, \u201cAnd if it doesn\u2019t?\u201d\nhe asks softly. </p><p>\u201cAs I explained to your friends, if anything happens to Mr.\nRogers I\u2019ll pay all his medical expenses for the rest of his life, any funeral\ncosts, and provide a lifetime allowance for Ms. Carter and Mr. Barnes. It\u2019s\nnowhere near enough to make up for the loss of a loved one, but it\u2019s what I can\noffer.\u201d</p><p>Peter hums in agreement and continues reading in silence,\nletting all the information sink in and process. His head spins with formulas\nand equations, and once it quiets, he realizes that he has no idea how much\ntime has passed with him just standing here. Turning, he\u2019s surprised to find\nTony back at his work table, head bent over what appears to be a technical\ndrawing. </p><p>Taking a few steps closer, he peers down and frowns; this looks\nlike weaponry\u2026far more advanced than anything SI has produced so far and his\nstomach turns, blood going icy. </p><p>\u201cThis was all a ruse, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d he whispers in disbelief, \u201cA\nway for you to look good to the media before unveiling whatever this new weapon\nis and making even more money on death.\u201d</p><p>Tony looks up stunned, glances down at the sketch and blanches.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s, it\u2019s not what you think,\u201d he insists. He rises half out of his chair\nas Peter steps away, waving him off, anger surging through his veins once more.\n</p><p>\u201cForget it Stark. I should have known better,\u201d he snaps. </p><p>\u201cJARVIS, bring up Project TI22,\u201d he orders, stumbling over the\nstool to hurry in front of Peter, hands raised placatingly. \u201cListen, Peter,\njust, please look,\u201d he pleads, holding a hand out as his dark eyes gleam with\nuncertainty. </p><p>Peter stares up at him for a long moment before turning back,\nbrow furrowing as he takes in what\u2019s before him. It\u2019s a suit of some kind,\nenormous and weighted down with bulky weapons and in the corner of the\nholographic he sees the word MARK I. </p><p>\u201cThis is how I escaped in Iraq. I took the weapons they gave me\nto build the Jericho and built this instead with Yinsen. It was supposed to get\nus both free but he sacrificed himself to make sure I had enough time to finish\nthe suit and I wouldn\u2019t have made it if he hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Peter steps into the hologram, toying with the specs, studying\neach piece individually and together with the whole of the suit before he looks\nback and shakes his head, incredulous. \u201cYou did this in a <i>cave</i>,\u201d he murmurs, astounded. </p><p>Tony grins weakly, \u201cGenius,\u201d he replies, pointing to himself,\nand Peter laughs, sharp and unexpected, because, yea, only a genius <i>could</i> build something this incredible in\na cave. Tony takes a hesitant step forward and lifts a hand, swipes the MARK I\naway and with another swipe brings up more drawings and schematics for\nsomething labeled MARK II. \u201cThis is what I\u2019m building now. I\u2019m going to use it\nto hunt down the Ten Rings and destroy any of my weapons that they still have.\nI won\u2019t let my weapons fall into the wrong hands again,\u201d he vows. </p><p>Peter looks between the schematics and Tony\u2019s hopeful face,\ntakes a slow, hesitant step toward him as a smile works its way across his face\nand joy blooms in his face. He\u2019s half a foot from Tony as he stares up at him,\nstudying the lines around his eyes and the exhaustion on his face and it occurs\nto him suddenly that he\u2019s close enough that if he just leaned up a bit, he\ncould kiss Tony. </p><p>\u201cI promise, this is the only weapon I\u2019ll ever design again. It\u2019s\nmy responsibility to fix what my company did, to try and make things right.\u201d\nTony gazes down at him intently, hand hovering by his side for a moment before\nhe reaches out and wraps his fingers around Peter\u2019s wrist and the heat of them\nsears into his skin, leaves his pulse rocketing and his cheeks pink.</p><p>\u201cI swear Peter, you can trust me.\u201d</p><p>Peter nods slowly and twists his wrist free, turns his hand so\nit can take Tony\u2019s and squeeze. </p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>Ohhhh man, our boys are getting closer!! Can you feel the mutual longing?\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://starkercrossedlovers.tumblr.com/post/183694060037/love-other-drugs-ch-1-fortunate-son\" draggable=\"false\">Ch 1</a></p><p><a

The last time they\nhad a surprise for him he was being sent to a new boarding school. </i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh sweetie, it&rsquo;s\nnothing bad, I promise,&rdquo; his mother assures him, hand gentle on the back of his\nneck as she leans in to press her lips to his hair. He inhales her perfume;\nChanel, and relishes in the gentle touch, the warmth and security the simple\ngesture provides. </i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;So what is it?&rdquo; he\nasks when she pulls back and takes his hand, squeezing it gently. </i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re the\nfirst to know,&rdquo; she tells him, smile widening and eyes brightening. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re\ngoing to be a big brother.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>He stares at her for a\nmoment before his gaze flickers down to her still flat stomach; wonder and\nconfusion and excitement filling him. He reaches out hesitantly, glances up to\nfind her watching and when she realizes his intent she smiles and takes his\nhand, presses it to her belly so he can feel the soft curve there. </i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too soon to feel\nhim moving, but he&rsquo;s in there,&rdquo; she tells him, grinning conspiratorially, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s\nabout the size of a blueberry right now. In a few weeks you&rsquo;ll be able to feel\nhim flipping around in there.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Tony grins and throws\nhimself into her arms, her soft oof melting easily into laughter. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so\ncool mom,&rdquo; he whispers before a firm hand at his shoulder pulls him back and\nhis father is frowning at him, shaking his head. </i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do that\nTony, your mother is in a delicate stage, you have to be gentle.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>He nods solemnly and\nthen looks back at his mother apologetically, &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he whispers, &ldquo;Did\nI&hellip;hurt it?&rdquo; he asks fearfully. Tears burn in his eyes; he loves his mother,\nand if he hurt her&hellip;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Maria shakes her head\nand opens her arms, &ldquo;Come here sweetie, it&rsquo;s ok, we just have to be gentle,&rdquo;\nshe murmurs as he curls back into her arms. </i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>He hears Howard huff\nand feels it when he stands from the couch, &ldquo;You shoudn&rsquo;t coddle him Maria. He\nneeds to know what can happen if he&rsquo;s irresponsible. Tony, let her go,&rdquo; he\norders, yanking on Tony&rsquo;s arm till it hurts and he&rsquo;s pulled away from his mother\nand onto his feet. </i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Howard looms over him,\nfrowning, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your responsibility to help your mother Tony. She&rsquo;ll need to\nrest and sleep and I can&rsquo;t have you bothering her. Do you understand? If you\ntire her out, the baby will die.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Fear clutches his\nbelly and he glances to his mother with wide eyes, then back to his father,\nnodding emphatically. </i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I promise, I&rsquo;ll\nprotect her,&rdquo; he vows with all the solemnity a nine year old can muster. </i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Howard studies him a\nmoment before waving a hand, dismissing him. </i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>He pauses at the door\nand glances back to find his father already heading back to his office and his\nmother, still sitting on the couch, staring into the distance with a hollow\nlook on her face. He sees the bruise on her cheekbone and another on her wrist,\ntoo thin and delicate and he shivers, promises himself that he&rsquo;ll do better to\nprotect her, to make sure she&rsquo;s okay. </i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>It&rsquo;s his job, his\nresponsibility, and he won&rsquo;t fail anymore. </i></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry sir, but the latest iteration has proven\nunsuccessful.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony sighs heavily and sets aside the soldering iron, hands\ncramping after such delicate work and runs a hand over his face and through his\nhair, &ldquo;Right. Keep going,&rdquo; he orders. &ldquo;Make note of any useful data and apply\nit moving forward.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes sir. Might I suggest a break sir? It&rsquo;s been 18 hours since\nyour last meal.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony shifts in his seat and rolls his shoulders, &ldquo;Yea, sure,\norder a sandwich from the kitchen. Turkey and bacon on rye. No onion. Have them\nsend a soda too, root beer please.&rdquo;</p><p>JARVIS confirms the order and goes back to running trials on the\ndrug Tony&rsquo;s been trying to develop as a cure for AIDS, but he&rsquo;s no biochemist,\nso most of this is guess work and it drives him a little crazier every time an\niteration fails. </p><p>He stands and stretches, groans as his muscles protest. He&rsquo;s\ntired but has no real drive to sleep, not when he could be working on this. Not\nnow that it&rsquo;s life and death for the most important person in his life. Now\nit&rsquo;s up to him to keep Rhodey healthy while he searches for a way to cure him\nor treat him, anything to make sure he doesn&rsquo;t become one of the thousands that\nhave already died because of this disease. </p><p>With more data sets he could see how the drug he&rsquo;s testing is\nworking on different patients, but it&rsquo;s not like he has access to that many\npeople with AIDS. Pausing, he stands and breathes as an idea takes form. He\nlets it sink in and grow and then exhales unsteadily, excitement rising within\nhim.</p><p>&ldquo;JARVIS, contact Pepper and get her here. I&rsquo;ll also need the\nname of a biochemist and molecular engineer. Check and see if Bruce Banner is\nworking with any organizations, it&rsquo;s been a few years since we&rsquo;ve talked but he\nmight have a recommendation. Is there anyone at SI qualified?&rdquo;</p><p>He paces as he asks questions, mind whirling a mile a minute.\n&ldquo;Get me Rhodey after Pepper and start a new project,&rdquo; he orders, grin growing\nwith each second that passes. </p><p>&ldquo;Very good sir, Miss Potts has been notified and is on her way,\nestimated time of arrival, 2:33pm. What shall we call the project sir?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony grins. </p><p>&ldquo;Project Blue Sky.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>Peter huffs in disappointment, hanging up the phone after yet\nanother fruitless call to Stark Industries. Pepper hasn&rsquo;t been the font of\ninformation he&rsquo;s been hoping for, despite their sort of friendship and her\nbudding relationship with MJ. She&rsquo;s been polite but distant, insisting that she\ndoesn&rsquo;t know anything about how the Stark weapons ended up in the hands of the\nTen Rings, and surprisingly, he believes her. </p><p>To his even greater disappointment, Peggy hasn&rsquo;t turned anything\nup either&mdash;her resources within Iraq are limited and to get that kind of\ninformation would require her longest term asset to break cover, something\nshe&rsquo;d told him she couldn&rsquo;t do. </p><p>So he&rsquo;s back to square one. </p><p>He hasn&rsquo;t seen or heard from Stark(and he has to think of him as\nStark because Tony is the man who had bandaged his hand and nearly kissed him\nin the moonlight and he can&rsquo;t think of him like that because it hurts too much)\nin the weeks since he confronted him at the Gala, but he&rsquo;s read the articles on\nStark Industries and the new changes he&rsquo;s been implementing. Clean energy,\ninternet access for the masses, investment in medical technology and\npharmaceuticals, and a new clinic for AIDS and HIV patients have all taken the\ncity and the economy by storm. </p><p>He tries not to watch the interviews Stark does, stays silent at\nthe press gaggles and avoids eye contact when the older man&rsquo;s gaze flickers\nover the crowds, always searching for him, but he can&rsquo;t avoid him forever, he\nknows that. At some point he&rsquo;ll have to speak to him because Jameson is growing\nangrier each time he comes back without a quote for the paper. </p><p>Sighing, he glances at the clock and turns his attention back to\nhis article on the Hudson River cleanup effort&mdash;if he can get it done and to the\ncopy editor before five he&rsquo;ll be able to head out early and avoid the traffic\non his way downtown. Steve had finally gotten a job at a local art gallery,\nteaching an introductory class three times a week and tonight is their first\nshow of the student&rsquo;s art. </p><p>It&rsquo;s a quarter to five when he finishes, giving him just enough\ntime to stop at a flower stand and buy a few bundles of faded roses for the\nstudents. He hails a cab and sits back, watching the skyline change as they\ndrive, heart lurching when the familiar shape of Stark Tower passes by,\nthrowing a shadow onto the road below. </p><p>He think how much like the tower Tony is; larger than life,\ninfamous, untouchable. </p><p>Swallowing through a thick throat, he turns away and focuses on\nthe signs and faces slipping by. </p><p>It&rsquo;s just another building in a city full to overflowing with\ntoo many people and not enough heart. </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>The clinic won&rsquo;t be on its feet for another month so Tony&rsquo;s\nreduced to searching through his father&rsquo;s old files, searching for anything\nthat might help. He&rsquo;s heard the stories of the men his father had worked with\nduring WWII, trying to create an enhanced super soldier, but as he had heard\nover and over again, it had never worked. </p><p>His desk is covered in papers, some redacted, all labeled\nProject Rebirth. </p><p>It&rsquo;s late, or early, depending on how you look at it, and he&rsquo;s a\nthird of the way through a bottle of scotch, but he has a good feeling about\nthis. The test results on the men who underwent the serum process are\nfrightening; uncontrollable rage, sociopathy, insanity&hellip;in short, a complete\nfailure. </p><p>They have a database of about a hundred applicants for the new\ndrug trials and he has JARVIS run their bloodwork and psych panel against the\ndata from Rebirth, searching for a good match, but everyone involved so far\nshows little compatibility for the process. </p><p>He tasks JARVIS with running the serum against Rhodey&rsquo;s blood to\nsee if it can stop the virus only to be served crushing defeat when it does\nnothing. He searches the SI medical records for any employee or patient that\nmight be a good match for the serum and in the intervening time works with\nengineers on the construction of the clinic, hires a host of new doctors,\npsychiatrists and researchers, and spends far too much time thinking about\nPeter Parker. </p><p>He&rsquo;s avoided reaching out, recalling all too easily the look on\nhis face at the Gala, the way he had shied away from Tony&rsquo;s touch and each\ntime, it hits him like a punch to the gut. </p><p>After Rhodey&rsquo;s revelation he&rsquo;d spilled his own secrets to his\nbest friend; how he had discovered his weapons in the hands of the Ten Rings,\nhow he and Peter had agreed to work together to find out how they got them, how\nhe felt about Peter.</p><p>He shows Rhodey Peter&rsquo;s articles on Vietnam, tells him about his\ngrit and determination and how his eyes look like honey in the moonlight and\ncomes to a very startling realization; he <i>likes</i>\nPeter. Genuinely and without reservation. </p><p>He&rsquo;s the most honest and morally upstanding man Tony&rsquo;s ever met,\nincluding Rhodey and for the first time he finds himself caring what someone\nelse thinks about him. There&rsquo;s been a handful(three&mdash;four if you count Howard,\nand he hasn&rsquo;t since he was 10 and too experienced in all the ways a father\ncould disappoint and hurt) of people he valued the opinion of, and somehow, in\na short time, Peter had made his way onto that list. </p><p>&ldquo;Sir, I have found someone with whom initial tests show the\nserum would be a success.&rdquo;</p><p>Surprised, Tony looks up from where he&rsquo;s working on the boot\nthrusters for the new suit, &ldquo;Really? Pull it up, I want to see,&rdquo; he orders,\nsitting up straight and wincing as his back protests. JARVIS shows him the\nmedical file of one Steven Grant Rogers, birthplace Brooklyn, age 26 years. His\nbrows rise at the list of medical issues, mouth pursing as he reads. </p><p>&ldquo;Asthma, 100 pounds, anemia, arrhythmia, Jesus JARVIS this guy\nisn&rsquo;t a candidate, he&rsquo;d never survive!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;According to the initial scan of his blood and a virtual test\nof the serum, he is the ideal candidate.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony frowns at the hologram and sighs, maybe if he can&rsquo;t cure\nAIDS or treat it with the serum he can at least improve this guy&rsquo;s life. He\nflips through the data until he finds the address and phone number listed for\nthe kid, noting the names also listed at that address&mdash;Peggy Carter and James\nBarnes. </p><p>The names ring in his memory all day as he works on the suit and\ncomposes a letter, inviting the kid to come and receive treatment, and it&rsquo;s as\nhe&rsquo;s working on the capsule designed to administer the serum that they finally\nsink in. </p><p><i>Peggy, Barnes, Steve. </i></p><p>These are Peter&rsquo;s friends. </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Bucky frowns at the letter he&rsquo;s just been handed by a courier,\nbrows furrowing at the label indicating it&rsquo;s from Stark Industries. Sliding a\nfinger under the seal he pulls a letter free and reads, brows rising with each\nmoment until he calls out breathlessly for Peggy. </p><p>She&rsquo;s at his side a moment later, taking the letter he offers\nher, watching as her eyes widen and her breath catches. Her hand shakes as she\nleans into him, hopeful tears in her eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;We have to tell Steve,&rdquo; she whispers. </p><p>He nods and swallows hard because this, this could change\neverything for them. </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Peter hears about the offer from Stark two days later and isn&rsquo;t\nsure if he&rsquo;s shocked or amazed, too numb at the moment to really be sure what he&rsquo;s\nfeeling. Peggy and Bucky and Steve have already met with Stark and have heard\nall the risks and benefits now it&rsquo;s up to Steve to decide. </p><p>Still, Peter can&rsquo;t get it out of his head, this generosity, the\nthings the trio had said about Stark; how he had looked exhausted, how\nbeseechingly he had asked if he could help, how earnest he had been in his\nassurances that there would be no cost&mdash;that the only thing he wanted was to use\nSteve&rsquo;s results in future research. </p><p>It&rsquo;s late when Peter decides to go see Stark, too many questions\nleft unanswered for his journalistic leanings. He takes a taxi to the tower and\nstares up at it for a long moment before heading inside, palms clammy as he\nsmiles weakly at the security guards. He&rsquo;s painfully out of place in this\nmarble and gold lobby, jeans ripped at the knees and shirt stained by grease\nfrom where he&rsquo;s been working on the motorcycle, but hopefully they won&rsquo;t think\nhe&rsquo;s crazy when he asks to see Stark. </p><p>&ldquo;Um, Peter Parker to see Tony Stark,&rdquo; he says hopefully,\nuncertainly. The guard lifts a brow but dutifully places a call, speaking\nsoftly to whomever is on the line, brows rising in shock before he nods and\nhangs up. </p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark is in his lab. Take the fourth elevator to the 83rd\nfloor and wait for Jarvis to give you entry.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nods and steps through the gate, shuffling nervously as he\nwaits for the elevator, glancing over his shoulder to where the men are\nspeaking quietly and glancing over at him in interest. The doors slide open\nwith a ding and he steps in, presses the button for the 83rd floor and inhales\nsharply when the doors close and the elevator slides up smoothly. He runs his\nhands through his hair when he sees his reflection, grease smudged and tired,\nhair mussed and untidy, grimacing as he imagines what Aunt May would have to\nsay about his appearance. </p><p>The doors slide open again and he steps out, glancing around\ncautiously before heading for the large steel door, eyeing the keypad and some\nsort of scanner beside it that he thinks is likely for a thumbprint. </p><p>Glances around for some sign this Jarvis person is around and\nfrowns when he sees nothing but steel doors lining the hallway and no sign of\nanother human being except for the faint thrum of a heavy bassline thumping\nfrom behind this door. </p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Parker, please place your thumb on the scanner.&rdquo;</p><p>Whirling, he stares around the hallway wide eyed, heart racing.\nThere&rsquo;s no one there.</p><p>&ldquo;My apologies Mr. Parker, I am JARVIS&ndash;the Artificial Intelligence\nthat runs Stark Tower. Please place your thumb on the scanner.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter looks up toward the ceiling and spots the speakers that\nthe disembodied voice seems to be coming from and nods unsteadily, &ldquo;Right of\ncourse. Artificial Intelligence. That makes sense,&rdquo; he says weakly, reaching\nout to press his thumb to the scanner. This kind of technology shouldn&rsquo;t exist\nhe thinks, not yet anyway. Everything he&rsquo;s studied has said that a functional\nAI is still at least a decade away, yet here one is, talking and opening doors\nand controlling an entire building and yea, okay, he&rsquo;s a little freaked out. </p><p>The door opens in front of him and he steps through uncertainly,\nheading toward the sound of rock music and a blowtorch crackling, peering\naround the corner as he gets closer. What greets him is the sight of Tony Stark\nin a black tank top, arms sweaty and bare, flexing in the light as he works,\ngrease and dirt smudged over his skin and <i>wow</i>&hellip;that\nsure is something. </p><p>Swallowing hard, he approaches slowly, watching as Tony works,\nsteady handed and focused and it&rsquo;s hotter than it has any right to be, seeing\nhim like this. When he&rsquo;s a foot away from the workbench Tony looks up and\njolts, fumbling with the torch for a moment before shutting it off and tugging\nhis goggles up and off. </p><p>They stare at each other for a long silent moment. </p><p>&ldquo;Sir, Mr. Parker is here.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony snorts and rolls his eyes, &ldquo;Geez, you think J?&rdquo;</p><p>The sarcasm breaks the uneasy air and Peter shifts, searching\nfor the right words, but Tony gets there first. </p><p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t expecting to see you anytime soon,&rdquo; he admits, reaching\nfor a rag to wipe his hands off. &ldquo;What can I do for you Mr. Parker?&rdquo; he asks,\nand the disinterest in his voice hurts more than Peter expected. </p><p>His throat is thick for a moment and he ducks his head,\nstruggling with the anger and betrayal he still feels over Gulmira and sets it\nagainst this amazing gift Steve is being offered. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re offering to do for Steve,&rdquo; he murmurs, &ldquo;I&hellip;I\ncan&rsquo;t thank you enough,&rdquo; he stammers, cheeks flushing when Tony just stares at\nhim, expression bordering on apathetic. &ldquo;I was, I was hoping you might tell me\na little more about this treatment?&rdquo; he asks, &ldquo;Peggy and Bucky didn&rsquo;t really\nget into detail what it was, said you had asked them to be discrete.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony nods slowly, arms still crossed over his chest and Peter&rsquo;s\nstomach flutters when he lifts a hand to rub at his goatee, bicep flexing\ndistractingly. &ldquo;Is this on the record?&rdquo; he asks coldly, gaze flickering over\nPeter&rsquo;s shoulder, as though he doesn&rsquo;t even want to make eye contact and\nPeter&rsquo;s stomach plunges through the floor. </p><p>&ldquo;No, no, of course not,&rdquo; he assures the older man, &ldquo;I just, I\nwanted to know what the process would entail. Steve is one of my best friends;\nhe and Peggy and Bucky are like family and I just want to make sure he&rsquo;s going\nto be safe if he does this.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony makes a soft noise and shakes his head, running a hand\nthrough his hair and Peter&rsquo;s gaze tracks the movement, watching as his muscles\nflex and his skin ripples. Lust and want burn into his belly and he glances\naway, flushing. He shouldn&rsquo;t&hellip;he&rsquo;s supposed to be angry with Tony, but this\noffer to Steve has tilted his worldview. </p><p>If he&rsquo;s the kind of man who would build a clinic to treat those\nsick from AIDS and HIV and offer this thing to Steve that will make him a new,\nstronger man, then maybe he <i>isn&rsquo;t</i> the\nman who would sell his weapons to terrorists. It was sort of unbelievable\nanyway, after what he&rsquo;d been through, but seeing the destruction first hand had\nbeen hard to ignore and nearly impossible to process. </p><p>&ldquo;JARVIS, bring up the trial test of Mr. Rogers&rsquo; blood and the\nserum, including all files on Project Rebirth and declassify for Mr. Parker.&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s a moment of silence and Peter glances around\nuncertainly, wondering what the AI is going to do and then suddenly there&rsquo;s a\nglowing blue hologram in front of him showing blood tests, strings of chemical\nequations and pages upon pages of reports from Project Rebirth and he&rsquo;s utterly\nbreathless. </p><p>Tony steps forward, shoulder nudging Peter&rsquo;s as he lifts a hand\nand flips through the pages, &ldquo;Like this,&rdquo; he murmurs, showing Peter how to\nflip, zoom and move things around. He steps back and waves a hand, &ldquo;Take a\nlook.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter swallows hard and moves forward, studying the blood\nchemistry and the makeup of the serum, gaze flickering over the test results\nand the pages of information, eyes widening as he realizes just what this could\ndo to Steve. </p><p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look like it worked on any of the previous test\nsubjects,&rdquo; he murmurs, frowning deeply when he reads how many went insane, died\nduring testing or never even passed qualifications. </p><p>&ldquo;Yea, well, this is technology from forty years ago. With what\nwe know now about psychology and human biology, JARVIS and I are 98.7% sure\nthat the serum will work as designed.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter lifts a brow and flips another page, &ldquo;And if it doesn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;\nhe asks softly. </p><p>&ldquo;As I explained to your friends, if anything happens to Mr.\nRogers I&rsquo;ll pay all his medical expenses for the rest of his life, any funeral\ncosts, and provide a lifetime allowance for Ms. Carter and Mr. Barnes. It&rsquo;s\nnowhere near enough to make up for the loss of a loved one, but it&rsquo;s what I can\noffer.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter hums in agreement and continues reading in silence,\nletting all the information sink in and process. His head spins with formulas\nand equations, and once it quiets, he realizes that he has no idea how much\ntime has passed with him just standing here. Turning, he&rsquo;s surprised to find\nTony back at his work table, head bent over what appears to be a technical\ndrawing. </p><p>Taking a few steps closer, he peers down and frowns; this looks\nlike weaponry&hellip;far more advanced than anything SI has produced so far and his\nstomach turns, blood going icy. </p><p>&ldquo;This was all a ruse, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he whispers in disbelief, &ldquo;A\nway for you to look good to the media before unveiling whatever this new weapon\nis and making even more money on death.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony looks up stunned, glances down at the sketch and blanches.\n&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not what you think,&rdquo; he insists. He rises half out of his chair\nas Peter steps away, waving him off, anger surging through his veins once more.\n</p><p>&ldquo;Forget it Stark. I should have known better,&rdquo; he snaps. </p><p>&ldquo;JARVIS, bring up Project TI22,&rdquo; he orders, stumbling over the\nstool to hurry in front of Peter, hands raised placatingly. &ldquo;Listen, Peter,\njust, please look,&rdquo; he pleads, holding a hand out as his dark eyes gleam with\nuncertainty. </p><p>Peter stares up at him for a long moment before turning back,\nbrow furrowing as he takes in what&rsquo;s before him. It&rsquo;s a suit of some kind,\nenormous and weighted down with bulky weapons and in the corner of the\nholographic he sees the word MARK I. </p><p>&ldquo;This is how I escaped in Iraq. I took the weapons they gave me\nto build the Jericho and built this instead with Yinsen. It was supposed to get\nus both free but he sacrificed himself to make sure I had enough time to finish\nthe suit and I wouldn&rsquo;t have made it if he hadn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter steps into the hologram, toying with the specs, studying\neach piece individually and together with the whole of the suit before he looks\nback and shakes his head, incredulous. &ldquo;You did this in a <i>cave</i>,&rdquo; he murmurs, astounded. </p><p>Tony grins weakly, &ldquo;Genius,&rdquo; he replies, pointing to himself,\nand Peter laughs, sharp and unexpected, because, yea, only a genius <i>could</i> build something this incredible in\na cave. Tony takes a hesitant step forward and lifts a hand, swipes the MARK I\naway and with another swipe brings up more drawings and schematics for\nsomething labeled MARK II. &ldquo;This is what I&rsquo;m building now. I&rsquo;m going to use it\nto hunt down the Ten Rings and destroy any of my weapons that they still have.\nI won&rsquo;t let my weapons fall into the wrong hands again,&rdquo; he vows. </p><p>Peter looks between the schematics and Tony&rsquo;s hopeful face,\ntakes a slow, hesitant step toward him as a smile works its way across his face\nand joy blooms in his face. He&rsquo;s half a foot from Tony as he stares up at him,\nstudying the lines around his eyes and the exhaustion on his face and it occurs\nto him suddenly that he&rsquo;s close enough that if he just leaned up a bit, he\ncould kiss Tony. </p><p>&ldquo;I promise, this is the only weapon I&rsquo;ll ever design again. It&rsquo;s\nmy responsibility to fix what my company did, to try and make things right.&rdquo;\nTony gazes down at him intently, hand hovering by his side for a moment before\nhe reaches out and wraps his fingers around Peter&rsquo;s wrist and the heat of them\nsears into his skin, leaves his pulse rocketing and his cheeks pink.</p><p>&ldquo;I swear Peter, you can trust me.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nods slowly and twists his wrist free, turns his hand so\nit can take Tony&rsquo;s and squeeze. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>Ohhhh man, our boys are getting closer!!

The last time they\nhad a surprise for him he was being sent to a new boarding school. </i></p>\n<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;Oh sweetie, it&rsquo;s\nnothing bad, I promise,&rdquo; his mother assures him, hand gentle on the back of his\nneck as she leans in to press her lips to his hair. He inhales her perfume;\nChanel, and relishes in the gentle touch, the warmth and security the simple\ngesture provides. </i></p>\n<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;So what is it?&rdquo; he\nasks when she pulls back and takes his hand, squeezing it gently. </i></p>\n<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re the\nfirst to know,&rdquo; she tells him, smile widening and eyes brightening. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re\ngoing to be a big brother.&rdquo;</i></p>\n<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>\n<p><i>He stares at her for a\nmoment before his gaze flickers down to her still flat stomach; wonder and\nconfusion and excitement filling him. He reaches out hesitantly, glances up to\nfind her watching and when she realizes his intent she smiles and takes his\nhand, presses it to her belly so he can feel the soft curve there. </i></p>\n<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too soon to feel\nhim moving, but he&rsquo;s in there,&rdquo; she tells him, grinning conspiratorially, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s\nabout the size of a blueberry right now. In a few weeks you&rsquo;ll be able to feel\nhim flipping around in there.&rdquo;</i></p>\n<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>\n<p><i>Tony grins and throws\nhimself into her arms, her soft oof melting easily into laughter. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so\ncool mom,&rdquo; he whispers before a firm hand at his shoulder pulls him back and\nhis father is frowning at him, shaking his head. </i></p>\n<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do that\nTony, your mother is in a delicate stage, you have to be gentle.&rdquo;</i></p>\n<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>\n<p><i>He nods solemnly and\nthen looks back at his mother apologetically, &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he whispers, &ldquo;Did\nI&hellip;hurt it?&rdquo; he asks fearfully. Tears burn in his eyes; he loves his mother,\nand if he hurt her&hellip;</i></p>\n<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>\n<p><i>Maria shakes her head\nand opens her arms, &ldquo;Come here sweetie, it&rsquo;s ok, we just have to be gentle,&rdquo;\nshe murmurs as he curls back into her arms. </i></p>\n<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>\n<p><i>He hears Howard huff\nand feels it when he stands from the couch, &ldquo;You shoudn&rsquo;t coddle him Maria. He\nneeds to know what can happen if he&rsquo;s irresponsible. Tony, let her go,&rdquo; he\norders, yanking on Tony&rsquo;s arm till it hurts and he&rsquo;s pulled away from his mother\nand onto his feet. </i></p>\n<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>\n<p><i>Howard looms over him,\nfrowning, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your responsibility to help your mother Tony. She&rsquo;ll need to\nrest and sleep and I can&rsquo;t have you bothering her. Do you understand? If you\ntire her out, the baby will die.&rdquo;</i></p>\n<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>\n<p><i>Fear clutches his\nbelly and he glances to his mother with wide eyes, then back to his father,\nnodding emphatically. </i></p>\n<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;I promise, I&rsquo;ll\nprotect her,&rdquo; he vows with all the solemnity a nine year old can muster. </i></p>\n<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>\n<p><i>Howard studies him a\nmoment before waving a hand, dismissing him. </i></p>\n<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>\n<p><i>He pauses at the door\nand glances back to find his father already heading back to his office and his\nmother, still sitting on the couch, staring into the distance with a hollow\nlook on her face. He sees the bruise on her cheekbone and another on her wrist,\ntoo thin and delicate and he shivers, promises himself that he&rsquo;ll do better to\nprotect her, to make sure she&rsquo;s okay. </i></p>\n<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>\n<p><i>It&rsquo;s his job, his\nresponsibility, and he won&rsquo;t fail anymore. </i></p>\n</p>",

Well, in some form, those dreams were resolved in Endgame.</p><p>We\u2019ll start with the most obvious one: Tony Stark. He dreamed that his team would die, and he wasn\u2019t able to save them. In Endgame, he dies after stealing the stones back from Thanos and snapping his fingers, ultimately destroying himself. Also, the way his suit moved to form the infinity gauntlet, that didn\u2019t just happen in the moment. He had to code that function into his suit, meaning he KNEW they might fail. He KNEW that they needed a fail-safe, and he WANTED it to be him. When talking with Fury in AOU, he says that the worst part wasn\u2019t that everyone died, it was that he didn\u2019t. He stopped his dream from coming true by sacrificing himself so the others could live.</p><p>Next up: Thor. He dreamed that he failed Asgard and (similar to Tony) was unable to stop their pending doom. In some ways, this was true, as they did have to let Asgard be destroyed in order to stop Hela from destroying them all. Then, Thanos killed half of his people. So yes, his dream did come true: *EXCEPT*, due to unforseen circumstances, he never officially became the king of Asgard, and when he got the chance, he said no and passed the title on to Valkyrie. So, by not becoming king, he stopped what he dreamed would happen from actually happening (except for Heimdall\u2019s death; RIP).</p><p>Of course, we have Natasha. She saw her old days in the Red Room. Flashes of ballerinas, training, and the\u00a0\u2018graduation ceremony\u2019. Because of this, she later told Bruce that she still thought of herself as the cold assassin they made her, and openly admitted that she wanted to make things right. She sacrificed herself for the soul stone, and there are two reasons for this. #1, Clint had a family to get back to. #2 is that this was her moment. This was her chance to prove herself and make amends. Her way of making peace with her restless soul, because we see time and time again that she still feels broken. She fixed herself. And, another one from the first movie, when she says she has red on ler ledger, and she wants to wipe it out. She paid her debt.</p><p>Then, there\u2019s Steve. He dreamed that he was back in the good\u00a0\u2018ol days with Peggy, finally presented with the chance to go home and have his dance with her. This one is quite obvious. He saw a chance at that dream, at that life he had wanted so long ago, and he took it. He went home and finally got his dance.</p><p>All these nightmares were fulfilled or stopped by the action\u2019s taken in Endgame, and it really makes you wonder: were they thinking about those dreams when it happened?</p><p>Or was it just their subconscious all along, preventing their worst fears and giving them their dreams.</p>",

MAJOR!</b></p><p>So, I\u2019ve had yet another brilliant brain child.\u00a0</p><p>We all remember the dreams, or\u00a0\u2018visions\u2019 that Wanda inflicted on some of the Avengers in Age of Ultron, right? Well, in some form, those dreams were resolved in Endgame.</p><p>We\u2019ll start with the most obvious one: Tony Stark. He dreamed that his team would die, and he wasn\u2019t able to save them. In Endgame, he dies after stealing the stones back from Thanos and snapping his fingers, ultimately destroying himself. Also, the way his suit moved to form the infinity gauntlet, that didn\u2019t just happen in the moment. He had to code that function into his suit, meaning he KNEW they might fail. He KNEW that they needed a fail-safe, and he WANTED it to be him. When talking with Fury in AOU, he says that the worst part wasn\u2019t that everyone died, it was that he didn\u2019t. He stopped his dream from coming true by sacrificing himself so the others could live.</p><p>Next up: Thor. He dreamed that he failed Asgard and (similar to Tony) was unable to stop their pending doom. In some ways, this was true, as they did have to let Asgard be destroyed in order to stop Hela from destroying them all. Then, Thanos killed half of his people. So yes, his dream did come true: *EXCEPT*, due to unforseen circumstances, he never officially became the king of Asgard, and when he got the chance, he said no and passed the title on to Valkyrie. So, by not becoming king, he stopped what he dreamed would happen from actually happening (except for Heimdall\u2019s death; RIP).</p><p>Of course, we have Natasha. She saw her old days in the Red Room. Flashes of ballerinas, training, and the\u00a0\u2018graduation ceremony\u2019. Because of this, she later told Bruce that she still thought of herself as the cold assassin they made her, and openly admitted that she wanted to make things right. She sacrificed herself for the soul stone, and there are two reasons for this. #1, Clint had a family to get back to. #2 is that this was her moment. This was her chance to prove herself and make amends. Her way of making peace with her restless soul, because we see time and time again that she still feels broken. She fixed herself. And, another one from the first movie, when she says she has red on ler ledger, and she wants to wipe it out. She paid her debt.</p><p>Then, there\u2019s Steve. He dreamed that he was back in the good\u00a0\u2018ol days with Peggy, finally presented with the chance to go home and have his dance with her. This one is quite obvious. He saw a chance at that dream, at that life he had wanted so long ago, and he took it. He went home and finally got his dance.</p><p>All these nightmares were fulfilled or stopped by the action\u2019s taken in Endgame, and it really makes you wonder: were they thinking about those dreams when it happened?</p><p>Or was it just their subconscious all along, preventing their worst fears and giving them their dreams.</p>",
