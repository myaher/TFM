        "body": "<h1>Good morning </h1><p>Bucky Barnes X Reader</p><p>Warnings: cheating, insecurities, lies, angst, misleading storyline?? This one is long </p><p>Summary: when Bucky stops texting his long distance girlfriend good mornings each morning she gets suspicious, going back to America to visit him she&rsquo;s in for a surprise she had never expected. </p><p>A/N: guess who&rsquo;s writing again? No one because no one guessed because like 3 people will read this and it will be dead forever *shrug* I feel like this storyline is really misleading so, sorry? Also AOS is a main theme for this but if you don&rsquo;t watch the show it really doesn&rsquo;t matter </p><p><span class=\"npf_color_joey\"><i><b>This is Bobbie btw for anyone who wants to know what she looks like for this</b></i></span></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"229\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1cca24ca8cfb3c00dd390896d322b799/tumblr_phy33iNaYM1w2h4p1_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"229\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><p>It had been over a year since you had seen your boyfriend, well <i>properly</i> seen your boyfriend, moving back to England was a hard decision for you but you knew it was the best one, you knew that taking the promotion was the best thing you could do but your mind was still constantly plagued with insecurities and worries, but you knew Bucky wasn&rsquo;t like that, he could never? Could he?</p><p>It had started about 3 months ago, his usually cheerful morning texts which never failed to bring a smile to your face had stopped, almost ceased to exist, from his constant <i>hey, baby! How&rsquo;s my gorgeous girl? </i>To his<i> babyyy! Wake uupp! It&rsquo;s been too long! Facetime me when you&rsquo;re free my pretty doll. </i>his morning texts had fallen to a simple <i>hey</i> or <i>I&rsquo;m busy</i> <i>we&rsquo;ll talk later </i>and the main fact he never bothered to text first anymore had caused your usual insecurities to skyrocket, why did he never have time to send you a simple hello anymore? Or more importantly <i>who</i> meant he didn&rsquo;t have the time? </p><p>Your phone buzzed as you say in bed, mind plagued by thoughts, you immediately shot up,  hopefully Bucky had gone back to usual? Opening your phone you had found a simple text from your boss Phil <i>&lsquo;meet me in the</i> <i>headquarters at 10&rsquo;, </i>why was Phil in England? More importantly why did he need to see you?</p><p>Standing up you prepared yourself for the day to come.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey y/n/n!&rdquo; Your good friend and teammate Bobbi chirped as she brought you your regular morning drink </p><p>&ldquo;mornin&rsquo; Bob&rdquo; you slurred out as you wrapped your coat around your frame tightly, shivering as you took in the very open windows. </p><p>&ldquo;someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed today. Argh! No! Stop throwing things at me!&rdquo; Hunter shrieked as Bobbi began throwing pillows at him. </p><p>&ldquo;Wow, adorable couple&rdquo; you mumbled as you took in the pair, after getting remarried the pair had fallen deeply in love once again, you wished you could have that but unfortunately being the director of S.A.B, shield associations Britain you barely had the time to speak to Bucky, yet alone the time to break up with him or move on, whereas normal couples may have fallen apart you were way to busy to even think about dating or parties or even making new friends, you stuck to your own lane. </p><p>&ldquo;hunter! Barbra!&rdquo;  A familiar, fatherly voice boomed as the familiar figure of Phil Coulson stepped into the office, taking in the pair he hadn&rsquo;t seen since Russia &ldquo;I thought you two were never coming back to shield?&rdquo; He grinned happily</p><p>&ldquo;we could never leave our dear y/n alone in a country! She&rsquo;s so far into work she hasn&rsquo;t even been shopping yet!&rdquo; Bobbie exasperated &ldquo;and please, Phil! Dont call me Barbra! Barbra is far worse than any possible nickname you could give me!&rdquo; The blonde grinned cheekily</p><p>&ldquo;Bobbie, stop being so dramatic, we went shopping last month!&rdquo; You shook your head playfully as you took a seat at your desk, gesturing for Phil to sit opposite you beside Hunter -who had perched himself happily onto one of the plush leather chairs- </p><p>&ldquo;I need you to come back to New York for a while&rdquo; Phil stated softly </p><p>&ldquo;what? Really? <i>Ohmygosh</i> <i>nofreakingway</i>!&rdquo; You shrieked happily </p><p>&ldquo;English, y/n/n!&rdquo; Hunter playfully chided, wagging a finger at you as you practically glowed, you had missed your friends and especially Bucky. </p><p>&ldquo;when?&rdquo; You asked excitedly </p><p>&ldquo;next month, I&rsquo;m sending agent Piper to hold things down till you get back here&rdquo; Phil smiled at the young woman, barely reached her late 20&rsquo;s and still so experienced yet full of life. A small smile graced his lips as he watched the h/c girl jump up and start rambling.</p><p>\u2022 time skipy\u2022 </p><p>The buzz of the quinjet filled your ears as you stepped off, e/c orbs wandered as you took in the familiar tower in which your boyfriend and some of your closest friends lived, sighing deeply you grabbed Bobbi&rsquo;s hand and quickly guided her to the doors </p><p>&ldquo;nervous?&rdquo; She asks over the low rumble of the quinjet ascending back into the air and back to the main s.h.i.e.l.d base. Turning your head to face Bobbi you opened your mouth to deny but quickly remembered how useless it would be- you knew the spy since s.h.i.e.l.d academy! She knows you better than you do and vice versa </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why, b! I mean I&rsquo;m going to see some of my best friends AND my boyfriend!&rsquo; you blurted out exasperated, anyone walking past might have looked at you like you&rsquo;re crazy but Barbara Morse was your best friend in the entire world and she had seen much worse than you screaming out into the rough winds. </p><p>&quot;y/f/n&rdquo; she stopped walking abruptly piping your linked arms backwards with her &ldquo;has Bucky been acting weird with you?&rdquo; She asked inquisitively, shrugging you immediately regretted not speaking to her about Bucky before, she would have helped. &ldquo;Oh y/n/n; you didn&rsquo;t you tell me? No wonder you&rsquo;re so skitterish today! Whatever it is I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s nothing too big, Bucky loves you and I can even tell that without meeting the man! He&rsquo;s probably on a mission or something, he IS an avenger&rdquo; Bobbi calmly rubbed your back as she spoke, guiding your hand to the identification scanners.</p><p>&ldquo;thanks Bob, you always know how to make me feel so much better. I love you&rdquo; you sighed dreamily, aiming to annoy the woman &ldquo;oh you cow! Stop being so corny!&rdquo; The blonde laughed aloud and she lightly smacked your hand, walking into the escalators you  began calming your nerves, you felt like a giddy teenager going to her first date. And you hated it. The fact that a few stupid texts had lead you into this trivial paranoid stage had fully set into your mind. It was Bucky for god&rsquo;s sake! James Buchanan Barnes, the same James who stumbled over his words when asking you out, the same bucky who arrived an hour early to pick you up for said date and almost died when he realised, the same Mr Barnes who quit the avengers (although for 10 minutes) to be with you. He was your Bucky and you don&rsquo;t need texts to know that.</p><p>As the elevator doors pinged open you and Bobbie stepped out and into the large lounge which occupied the avengers.</p><p>Looking up Steve&rsquo;s mouth gaped open before jumping up and accidentally flipping the table over as he ran towards you &ldquo;Y/N/N! YOU&rsquo;RE HERE OH MY! I HAVEN&rsquo;T SEEN YOU IN SO LONG! I MISSED YOU!! AND IM SO SORRY ABOUT HOW HE-&rdquo; Steve blabbered out as he <strike>squeezed </strike>hugged you tightly, barley taking in anything he was saying you were quick to end his ramblings</p><p>&ldquo;'tevie! I&rsquo;ve missed you and all but shhhh inside voices remember&rdquo; you laughed as the soldier nodded looking like a lost puppy </p><p>&ldquo;sorry y/n/n but I&rsquo;ve missed my best friend so-&rdquo; this was when Bobbie felt to make her presence known &ldquo;hold up! Wait a minute! If anyone is y/f/n&rsquo;s best friend; it&rsquo;s ME. So sit down mate, she&rsquo;s mine&rdquo; bobbie stated proudly, reminding you of your (then) puppy when meeting Bucky </p><p>Shaking your head you introduced Bobbie and greeted everyone else, sitting down inbetween Pietro and Wanda you looked around the room, the obvious man who wasn&rsquo;t in the room still plagued your mind &ldquo;hey,guys where Bucky?&rdquo; You asked with a small smile, the avengers a looked at you as if you&rsquo;d grown 2 heads &ldquo;what? Can&rsquo;t I see my boyfriend?&rdquo; You laughed, greeted with silence you stood up &ldquo;I check I&rsquo;ll check his room then?&rdquo; You asked wearily before all but sprinting our the room, barely noticing how the room erupted and bob and Steve had run after you.</p><p>The elevator door closed as soon as you stepped inside, you were so confused, why was everyone so shocked? Especially when you called him your boyfriend? And Steve looked mortified! Taking a deep breath you stepped out and walked to your &ldquo;boyfriends&rdquo; door</p><p>&ldquo;<i>hmm yes buck!</i>&rdquo; A feminine voice sighed from the room as you neared it, stopping about a step away from the door you could almost feel the tears gathering in your e/c orbs, pushing them away you stopped to listen&hellip;not a sound came out, your mind must have been playing tricks surely! </p><p>Gulping a big breath of air you stepped forwards and opened the door quickly &ldquo;Bucky! Surprise! I&rsquo;m- Oh my god&rdquo; your playful tone turned quiet and lifeless and you took in the scene Infront of you, bucky laying almost naked ontop of a scantily clad Natasha </p><p>\u2022</p><p>Steve knew something was wrong the moment you asked for Bucky, why would she ask where Bucky is?

Could he?</p><p>It had started about 3 months ago, his usually cheerful morning texts which never failed to bring a smile to your face had stopped, almost ceased to exist, from his constant <i>hey, baby! How\u2019s my gorgeous girl? </i>To his<i> babyyy! Wake uupp! It\u2019s been too long!

Or more importantly <i>who</i> meant he didn\u2019t have the time? </p><p>Your phone buzzed as you say in bed, mind plagued by thoughts, you immediately shot up,  hopefully Bucky had gone back to usual? Opening your phone you had found a simple text from your boss Phil <i>\u2018meet me in the</i> <i>headquarters at 10\u2019, </i>why was Phil in England? More importantly why did he need to see you?</p><p>Standing up you prepared yourself for the day to come.</p><p>\u201cHey y/n/n!\u201d Your good friend and teammate Bobbi chirped as she brought you your regular morning drink </p><p>\u201cmornin\u2019 Bob\u201d you slurred out as you wrapped your coat around your frame tightly, shivering as you took in the very open windows. </p><p>\u201csomeone woke up on the wrong side of the bed today. Argh! No! Stop throwing things at me!\u201d Hunter shrieked as Bobbi began throwing pillows at him. </p><p>\u201cWow, adorable couple\u201d you mumbled as you took in the pair, after getting remarried the pair had fallen deeply in love once again, you wished you could have that but unfortunately being the director of S.A.B, shield associations Britain you barely had the time to speak to Bucky, yet alone the time to break up with him or move on, whereas normal couples may have fallen apart you were way to busy to even think about dating or parties or even making new friends, you stuck to your own lane. </p><p>\u201chunter! Barbra!\u201d  A familiar, fatherly voice boomed as the familiar figure of Phil Coulson stepped into the office, taking in the pair he hadn\u2019t seen since Russia \u201cI thought you two were never coming back to shield?\u201d He grinned happily</p><p>\u201cwe could never leave our dear y/n alone in a country! She\u2019s so far into work she hasn\u2019t even been shopping yet!\u201d Bobbie exasperated \u201cand please, Phil! Dont call me Barbra! Barbra is far worse than any possible nickname you could give me!\u201d The blonde grinned cheekily</p><p>\u201cBobbie, stop being so dramatic, we went shopping last month!\u201d You shook your head playfully as you took a seat at your desk, gesturing for Phil to sit opposite you beside Hunter -who had perched himself happily onto one of the plush leather chairs- </p><p>\u201cI need you to come back to New York for a while\u201d Phil stated softly </p><p>\u201cwhat? Really? <i>Ohmygosh</i> <i>nofreakingway</i>!\u201d You shrieked happily </p><p>\u201cEnglish, y/n/n!\u201d Hunter playfully chided, wagging a finger at you as you practically glowed, you had missed your friends and especially Bucky. </p><p>\u201cwhen?\u201d You asked excitedly </p><p>\u201cnext month, I\u2019m sending agent Piper to hold things down till you get back here\u201d Phil smiled at the young woman, barely reached her late 20\u2019s and still so experienced yet full of life. A small smile graced his lips as he watched the h/c girl jump up and start rambling.</p><p>\u2022 time skipy\u2022 </p><p>The buzz of the quinjet filled your ears as you stepped off, e/c orbs wandered as you took in the familiar tower in which your boyfriend and some of your closest friends lived, sighing deeply you grabbed Bobbi\u2019s hand and quickly guided her to the doors </p><p>\u201cnervous?\u201d She asks over the low rumble of the quinjet ascending back into the air and back to the main s.h.i.e.l.d base. Turning your head to face Bobbi you opened your mouth to deny but quickly remembered how useless it would be- you knew the spy since s.h.i.e.l.d academy! She knows you better than you do and vice versa </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why, b! I mean I\u2019m going to see some of my best friends AND my boyfriend!\u2019 you blurted out exasperated, anyone walking past might have looked at you like you\u2019re crazy but Barbara Morse was your best friend in the entire world and she had seen much worse than you screaming out into the rough winds. </p><p>\"y/f/n\u201d she stopped walking abruptly piping your linked arms backwards with her \u201chas Bucky been acting weird with you?\u201d She asked inquisitively, shrugging you immediately regretted not speaking to her about Bucky before, she would have helped. \u201cOh y/n/n; you didn\u2019t you tell me? No wonder you\u2019re so skitterish today! Whatever it is I\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing too big, Bucky loves you and I can even tell that without meeting the man! He\u2019s probably on a mission or something, he IS an avenger\u201d Bobbi calmly rubbed your back as she spoke, guiding your hand to the identification scanners.</p><p>\u201cthanks Bob, you always know how to make me feel so much better. I love you\u201d you sighed dreamily, aiming to annoy the woman \u201coh you cow! Stop being so corny!\u201d The blonde laughed aloud and she lightly smacked your hand, walking into the escalators you  began calming your nerves, you felt like a giddy teenager going to her first date. And you hated it. The fact that a few stupid texts had lead you into this trivial paranoid stage had fully set into your mind. It was Bucky for god\u2019s sake! James Buchanan Barnes, the same James who stumbled over his words when asking you out, the same bucky who arrived an hour early to pick you up for said date and almost died when he realised, the same Mr Barnes who quit the avengers (although for 10 minutes) to be with you. He was your Bucky and you don\u2019t need texts to know that.</p><p>As the elevator doors pinged open you and Bobbie stepped out and into the large lounge which occupied the avengers.</p><p>Looking up Steve\u2019s mouth gaped open before jumping up and accidentally flipping the table over as he ran towards you \u201cY/N/N! YOU\u2019RE HERE OH MY! I HAVEN\u2019T SEEN YOU IN SO LONG! I MISSED YOU!! AND IM SO SORRY ABOUT HOW HE-\u201d Steve blabbered out as he <strike>squeezed </strike>hugged you tightly, barley taking in anything he was saying you were quick to end his ramblings</p><p>\u201c'tevie! I\u2019ve missed you and all but shhhh inside voices remember\u201d you laughed as the soldier nodded looking like a lost puppy </p><p>\u201csorry y/n/n but I\u2019ve missed my best friend so-\u201d this was when Bobbie felt to make her presence known \u201chold up! Wait a minute! If anyone is y/f/n\u2019s best friend; it\u2019s ME. So sit down mate, she\u2019s mine\u201d bobbie stated proudly, reminding you of your (then) puppy when meeting Bucky </p><p>Shaking your head you introduced Bobbie and greeted everyone else, sitting down inbetween Pietro and Wanda you looked around the room, the obvious man who wasn\u2019t in the room still plagued your mind \u201chey,guys where Bucky?\u201d You asked with a small smile, the avengers a looked at you as if you\u2019d grown 2 heads \u201cwhat? Can\u2019t I see my boyfriend?\u201d You laughed, greeted with silence you stood up \u201cI check I\u2019ll check his room then?\u201d You asked wearily before all but sprinting our the room, barely noticing how the room erupted and bob and Steve had run after you.</p><p>The elevator door closed as soon as you stepped inside, you were so confused, why was everyone so shocked? Especially when you called him your boyfriend? And Steve looked mortified! Taking a deep breath you stepped out and walked to your \u201cboyfriends\u201d door</p><p>\u201c<i>hmm yes buck!</i>\u201d A feminine voice sighed from the room as you neared it, stopping about a step away from the door you could almost feel the tears gathering in your e/c orbs, pushing them away you stopped to listen\u2026not a sound came out, your mind must have been playing tricks surely! </p><p>Gulping a big breath of air you stepped forwards and opened the door quickly \u201cBucky! Surprise! I\u2019m- Oh my god\u201d your playful tone turned quiet and lifeless and you took in the scene Infront of you, bucky laying almost naked ontop of a scantily clad Natasha </p><p>\u2022</p><p>Steve knew something was wrong the moment you asked for Bucky, why would she ask where Bucky is? Bucky had told the team he broke up with her to date Natasha MONTHS ago, then y/n called him her boyfriend and the entire team was stunned as it dawned onto steve.</p><p>Bucky didn\u2019t break up with his girlfriend, he was cheating on her with Natasha whilst the girl was off being a good person in England. </p><p>Steve quickly ran after his friend, Bobbie following shortly after as they attempted to keep up with the h/c girl, when the elevator doors closed quickly the man knew he was far too late. </p><p>\u201cRogers?

If something is wrong with my best friend I need to know!\u201d Barbara placed a hand onto the blondes arm, staring into his eyes as she searched for answers </p><p>\u201cBucky said they broke up, he\u2019s been seeing natasha since October\u201d </p><p>\u2022 </p><p>Bucky knew he\u2019d messed up, quickly scrambling off of natasha and throwing the blanket over her barely clothes body the ex assassin stared up at his girlfriend\u2026well ex now he guessed</p><p>\u201cyou\u2026 little\u2026I can\u2019t even..\u201d you gasped out as you stepped back into the hallway </p><p>\u201cy/n!
