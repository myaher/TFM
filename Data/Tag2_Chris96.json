Obviously this is fiction and all in good fun. This is a one shot but please let me know if you would like a part 2.

It was getting late, well, not really. You were more of a homebody these days and since it was after 6, yeah, you should probably get home. You turned back around on the sidewalk and started to walk the 12 or so blocks back to your street. You were trying to walk as much as possible to get to know the area. The LA lifestyle of driving everywhere wasn\u2019t your thing. You didn\u2019t like driving to begin with and you were never the primary driver back home. Home. What a difference a couple of months can make. </p><!-- more --><p>The weather is perfect for mid-March being in the 60s in the early evening hours. Back home you\u2019d still have snow on the ground and looking forward to days in the 40s. This is better. This is a change. This is good. Your family and friends thought you were crazy leaving a well-paying job and nice home in the suburbs that was mostly paid off to move from the Midwest to the West coast. You still lived in a family-oriented neighborhood, not quite adventurous enough to move downtown in a high rise. You were renting a studio apartment on the second story of James and Connie Smith\u2019s home. Their two kids had moved out on their own a couple of years ago and they decided to convert part of their second story. They liked the neighborhood and didn\u2019t want to move, but didn\u2019t need all the space. It\u2019s a nice unit on a tree lined street with enough room for you to park your car on the driveway. It was just you after all and after selling and donating most of your possessions, you didn\u2019t need a ton of room. </p><p>Instead of sticking to the sidewalk, you crossed the empty road to check out the small park you walked by earlier. It\u2019s not really a park per say as there isn\u2019t any playground equipment or picnic tables. More of a green space set aside for people to relax. At least that\u2019s how you thought of it. A large water fountain sat in the middle of the park with 4 wooden benches circling it. Walking up to the fountain you stuck your hand into the water for just a second feeling the cool liquid on your skin. It was quiet except for the splashing of the water. Being around dinner time few people were out walking around and you enjoyed the peacefulness of it all. Deciding to extend your evening stroll you took a seat at one of the benches and concentrated on the spray of the water. Losing yourself in the cool air and sounds of the water you didn\u2019t notice the cute brown and white dog trotting over to you until you felt something bump your knee. Slightly jumping up and off of the bench with a tiny squeak you looked down and saw your offender. </p><p>\u201cWell hello there pup! You kind of scared me for a second.\u201d Looking around you didn\u2019t see anybody in the park or down either side of the road. The adorable dog bumped your leg again with his nose and tilted his head to the side. He was wearing a collar with a blue leash attached but you didn\u2019t see any tags. \u201cWhere\u2019s your mama or your papa? Hmm?\u201d Bending down you gave his head a good rub seeing that he was definitely friendly. You weren\u2019t sure what to do. Your car was at least 6 blocks away, you didn\u2019t know where any veterinary clinics or animal shelters were and you didn\u2019t know anybody else in the neighborhood besides the Smiths. You picked up his leash and walked the perimeter of the park hoping someone would spot you or your new friend. After a few minutes and no one still in sight, you took a seat on the grass with your legs stretched out in front of you deciding to wait it out. </p><p>After about 10 minutes, your new K9 companion laid down next to you with his face resting on your left leg. Giving him a few rubs with his leash looped through your left hand you grabbed your phone with the other and absentmindedly scrolled through Twitter. </p><p>\u201cHey! What are you doing with my dog?\u201d A man\u2019s voice yelled from the other side of the park. He sounded almost angry. You jumped up quickly while trying to remain in control of the leash as the dog started to spin around in circles as the man jogged over to you. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. What did you say?\u201d You asked when the man reached you grabbing the leash out of your hand. He didn\u2019t respond but instead bent down on one knee letting the pup lick his face while telling him that he shouldn\u2019t run off like that again.</p><p>You stood there dumbstruck as he continued to ignore you. He stood back up and starred at you for a second before speaking. He was tall, but not overly tall. Being above average height yourself it\u2019s one of the first things you notice about a man. He had ballcap on down low but you could still see his piercing blue eyes. He had quite a lot of stubble on his face but it looked good on him. \u201cI asked what you were doing with my dog.\u201d He said.</p><p>\u201cOh, um, he wandered up to me and I saw that he had a leash but no one was around so I decided to stay here in case someone came looking for him. I live 6 blocks that way.\u201d You said while pointing to your left. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t want to head that way in case his owner was coming from the opposite way. You took a quick breath. \u201cI decided it was best to stay put and keep him company. I\u2019m really sorry if I worried you. I know I would be worried to if my dog, I mean, if I had a dog and he took off on me. And oh, I am really rambling here.\u201d You bit your bottom lip and placed your hand over your mouth.</p><p>His mouth quirked in a partial smile and his eyes crinkled at you. \u201cNo, I am sorry.\u201d He let out a breathy sigh. \u201cHe just had me so worried and then I saw the leash in your hand and I thought maybe you were trying to take him.\u201d </p><p>You let out a small giggle and extended your hand. \u201cI\u2019m Y/N.\u201d</p><p>He shook your hand. \u201cI\u2019m Chris. This naughty boy is Dodger.\u201d He gestured with hand. \u201cI hope he wasn\u2019t too much trouble. He normally stays next to me while we\u2019re in the garage. I had his leash on because we were going to go for a walk but I needed to grab something out of my car. I guess he decided to go ahead without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hi Dodger, it\u2019s great to have a name with a face.\u201d You said looking down into his gorgeous eyes. \u201cHe was a great companion this evening and it was no trouble at all. I\u2019m new to this neighborhood and city really, so it\u2019s nice to make new friends.\u201d You said with a wink. Were you flirting? No, this was absolutely not flirting. You weren\u2019t ready for that.</p><p>\u201cOh, where are you from?\u201d Chris asked. </p><p>\u201cMinnesota. Been here about two months now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite the move. What made you decide to move to LA?\u201d he asked. </p><p>\u201cI needed a change. Really it\u2019s more like a fresh start even though I\u2019m in my mid 30s and should probably be more settled.\u201d Did you just confess your age? Why would you do that? \u201cSo new career, new change of scenery. A warmer lifestyle.\u201d You said with a bright smile. You bounced on your feet, something you did when you were nervous. </p><p>You left home because you couldn\u2019t handle being in your house anymore. You met Caleb shortly after college and married a couple of years later. You both had stable jobs, a house, but a family never came. You both wanted it but it just wasn\u2019t in the cards for you. He was enough. Together you were enough. 8 years later Caleb was taken from you. A normal trip to the grocery store to grab a few things afterwork and he didn\u2019t make it home. Two policemen were at your door a couple of hours later. They told you Caleb was hit by a red-light runner and didn\u2019t make it. You lived in your house for a year by yourself. You decided to sell and once it sold, you decided to move.</p><p>\u201cChange is good at any age. What kind of career change are you making? Acting?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, God no.\u201d Realizing how bad that sounded you quickly added \u201cI mean, that\u2019s just not for me. I get pretty shy when the attention is on me and I can barely walk and talk at the same time. I\u2019m actually an events coordinator for a PR firm. Well, technically I am an assistant to an events coordinator but I am told that I could easily be moved up within a year. It\u2019s something I dabbled with in college.\u201d</p><p>He started to lift up his eyebrows and opened his mouth but you cut him off. \u201cAnd before you say it, I didn\u2019t plan keggers. I worked on university events like fundraisers.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and nodded his head. \u201cThat\u2019s really cool and I hope it works out for you.\u201d </p><p>Dodger started to whine and Chris looked down at him. \u201cI think he\u2019s ready for dinner and the sun is starting to set. I\u2019m sure you have places to be and we\u2019ve kept you long enough.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m actually just headed home. I don\u2019t really know anyone here yet, so I was just going to go home and Netflix and chill.\u201d Chris started to laugh and you realized your mistake.</p><p>\u201cI mean, watch Netflix and relax before going to bed. I don\u2019t think I can Netflix and chill by myself.\u201d Chris started to laugh again and shake his head. \u201cI suppose you could do that by yourself, but that\u2019s not what I am doing.\u201d You laughed and then let out a big huff of air. You pointed in the direction you were going. \u201cI should probably just go.\u201d </p><p>\u201cY/N, you are hilarious and it\u2019s been a pleasure meeting you. I thank you for keeping Dodger company for me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt was no problem at all. You have a sweet boy there.\u201d Bending down you gave Dodger a scratch behind the ear. You gave a wave to Chris and started to walk out the park, crossing back across the street to the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cHey Y/N!\u201d Chris yelled. You turned around and saw Chris and Dodger walking over toward you. </p><p>You stopped walking and turned around. \u201cYeah?\u201d You asked.</p><p>\u201cSo, a few friends and I get together once a month and play board games. It\u2019s kind of nerdy, but a lot of fun. It\u2019s a good group. I know you said you don\u2019t have any friends here yet, so would you want to come next time? It\u2019s not for a couple of weeks but I can text you when it gets closer to the day. </p><p>You couldn\u2019t help but smile a big toothy grin. \u201cThat would actually be really nice.\u201d You said. </p><p>Chris grabbed his phone out of his pocket, unlocked it, and handed it to you. You entered your contact info and handed it back. You didn\u2019t text yourself with his phone because you didn\u2019t want to assume he would actually follow through. He was already being really nice and you didn\u2019t want to be the one to reach out. </p><p>He put his phone back in his pocket and turned to leave. He yelled over his shoulder \u201cTalk to you later Y/N.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d You yelled back as you started to walk home. Smiling to yourself you continued on your way. \u201cI think I just met Chris Evans.\u201d</p><p>Walking up the back stairs to your studio you heard you phone ding. You unlocked the door, walked inside kicking off your shoes. Fishing your phone out of your back pocket you saw that you had a new text. Clicking it open it read \u201cHey Y/N, it\u2019s Chris. Just texting so you have my number.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://jamielea81.tumblr.com/post/183758651502/a-walk-in-the-park-description-when-your-husband\">Chapter 2</a></p>",

I don\u2019t think I can Netflix and chill by myself.\u201d Chris started to laugh again and shake his head. \u201cI suppose you could do that by yourself, but that\u2019s not what I am doing.\u201d You laughed and then let out a big huff of air. You pointed in the direction you were going. \u201cI should probably just go.\u201d </p><p>\u201cY/N, you are hilarious and it\u2019s been a pleasure meeting you. I thank you for keeping Dodger company for me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt was no problem at all. You have a sweet boy there.\u201d Bending down you gave Dodger a scratch behind the ear. You gave a wave to Chris and started to walk out the park, crossing back across the street to the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cHey Y/N!\u201d Chris yelled. You turned around and saw Chris and Dodger walking over toward you. </p><p>You stopped walking and turned around. \u201cYeah?\u201d You asked.</p><p>\u201cSo, a few friends and I get together once a month and play board games. It\u2019s kind of nerdy, but a lot of fun. It\u2019s a good group. I know you said you don\u2019t have any friends here yet, so would you want to come next time? It\u2019s not for a couple of weeks but I can text you when it gets closer to the day. </p><p>You couldn\u2019t help but smile a big toothy grin. \u201cThat would actually be really nice.\u201d You said. </p><p>Chris grabbed his phone out of his pocket, unlocked it, and handed it to you. You entered your contact info and handed it back. You didn\u2019t text yourself with his phone because you didn\u2019t want to assume he would actually follow through. He was already being really nice and you didn\u2019t want to be the one to reach out. </p><p>He put his phone back in his pocket and turned to leave. He yelled over his shoulder \u201cTalk to you later Y/N.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d You yelled back as you started to walk home. Smiling to yourself you continued on your way. \u201cI think I just met Chris Evans.\u201d</p><p>Walking up the back stairs to your studio you heard you phone ding. You unlocked the door, walked inside kicking off your shoes. Fishing your phone out of your back pocket you saw that you had a new text. Clicking it open it read \u201cHey Y/N, it\u2019s Chris. Just texting so you have my number.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://jamielea81.tumblr.com/post/183758651502/a-walk-in-the-park-description-when-your-husband\">Chapter 2</a></p></p>",

It was getting late, well, not really. You were more of a homebody these days and since it was after 6, yeah, you should probably get home. You turned back around on the sidewalk and started to walk the 12 or so blocks back to your street. You were trying to walk as much as possible to get to know the area. The LA lifestyle of driving everywhere wasn\u2019t your thing. You didn\u2019t like driving to begin with and you were never the primary driver back home. Home. What a difference a couple of months can make. </p>[[MORE]]<p>The weather is perfect for mid-March being in the 60s in the early evening hours. Back home you\u2019d still have snow on the ground and looking forward to days in the 40s. This is better. This is a change. This is good. Your family and friends thought you were crazy leaving a well-paying job and nice home in the suburbs that was mostly paid off to move from the Midwest to the West coast. You still lived in a family-oriented neighborhood, not quite adventurous enough to move downtown in a high rise. You were renting a studio apartment on the second story of James and Connie Smith\u2019s home. Their two kids had moved out on their own a couple of years ago and they decided to convert part of their second story. They liked the neighborhood and didn\u2019t want to move, but didn\u2019t need all the space. It\u2019s a nice unit on a tree lined street with enough room for you to park your car on the driveway. It was just you after all and after selling and donating most of your possessions, you didn\u2019t need a ton of room. </p><p>Instead of sticking to the sidewalk, you crossed the empty road to check out the small park you walked by earlier. It\u2019s not really a park per say as there isn\u2019t any playground equipment or picnic tables. More of a green space set aside for people to relax. At least that\u2019s how you thought of it. A large water fountain sat in the middle of the park with 4 wooden benches circling it. Walking up to the fountain you stuck your hand into the water for just a second feeling the cool liquid on your skin. It was quiet except for the splashing of the water. Being around dinner time few people were out walking around and you enjoyed the peacefulness of it all. Deciding to extend your evening stroll you took a seat at one of the benches and concentrated on the spray of the water. Losing yourself in the cool air and sounds of the water you didn\u2019t notice the cute brown and white dog trotting over to you until you felt something bump your knee. Slightly jumping up and off of the bench with a tiny squeak you looked down and saw your offender. </p><p>\u201cWell hello there pup! You kind of scared me for a second.\u201d Looking around you didn\u2019t see anybody in the park or down either side of the road. The adorable dog bumped your leg again with his nose and tilted his head to the side. He was wearing a collar with a blue leash attached but you didn\u2019t see any tags. \u201cWhere\u2019s your mama or your papa? Hmm?\u201d Bending down you gave his head a good rub seeing that he was definitely friendly. You weren\u2019t sure what to do. Your car was at least 6 blocks away, you didn\u2019t know where any veterinary clinics or animal shelters were and you didn\u2019t know anybody else in the neighborhood besides the Smiths. You picked up his leash and walked the perimeter of the park hoping someone would spot you or your new friend. After a few minutes and no one still in sight, you took a seat on the grass with your legs stretched out in front of you deciding to wait it out. </p><p>After about 10 minutes, your new K9 companion laid down next to you with his face resting on your left leg. Giving him a few rubs with his leash looped through your left hand you grabbed your phone with the other and absentmindedly scrolled through Twitter. </p><p>\u201cHey! What are you doing with my dog?\u201d A man\u2019s voice yelled from the other side of the park. He sounded almost angry. You jumped up quickly while trying to remain in control of the leash as the dog started to spin around in circles as the man jogged over to you. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. What did you say?\u201d You asked when the man reached you grabbing the leash out of your hand. He didn\u2019t respond but instead bent down on one knee letting the pup lick his face while telling him that he shouldn\u2019t run off like that again.</p><p>You stood there dumbstruck as he continued to ignore you. He stood back up and starred at you for a second before speaking. He was tall, but not overly tall. Being above average height yourself it\u2019s one of the first things you notice about a man. He had ballcap on down low but you could still see his piercing blue eyes. He had quite a lot of stubble on his face but it looked good on him. \u201cI asked what you were doing with my dog.\u201d He said.</p><p>\u201cOh, um, he wandered up to me and I saw that he had a leash but no one was around so I decided to stay here in case someone came looking for him. I live 6 blocks that way.\u201d You said while pointing to your left. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t want to head that way in case his owner was coming from the opposite way. You took a quick breath. \u201cI decided it was best to stay put and keep him company. I\u2019m really sorry if I worried you. I know I would be worried to if my dog, I mean, if I had a dog and he took off on me. And oh, I am really rambling here.\u201d You bit your bottom lip and placed your hand over your mouth.</p><p>His mouth quirked in a partial smile and his eyes crinkled at you. \u201cNo, I am sorry.\u201d He let out a breathy sigh. \u201cHe just had me so worried and then I saw the leash in your hand and I thought maybe you were trying to take him.\u201d </p><p>You let out a small giggle and extended your hand. \u201cI\u2019m Y/N.\u201d</p><p>He shook your hand. \u201cI\u2019m Chris. This naughty boy is Dodger.\u201d He gestured with hand. \u201cI hope he wasn\u2019t too much trouble. He normally stays next to me while we\u2019re in the garage. I had his leash on because we were going to go for a walk but I needed to grab something out of my car. I guess he decided to go ahead without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hi Dodger, it\u2019s great to have a name with a face.\u201d You said looking down into his gorgeous eyes. \u201cHe was a great companion this evening and it was no trouble at all. I\u2019m new to this neighborhood and city really, so it\u2019s nice to make new friends.\u201d You said with a wink. Were you flirting? No, this was absolutely not flirting. You weren\u2019t ready for that.</p><p>\u201cOh, where are you from?\u201d Chris asked. </p><p>\u201cMinnesota. Been here about two months now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite the move. What made you decide to move to LA?\u201d he asked. </p><p>\u201cI needed a change. Really it\u2019s more like a fresh start even though I\u2019m in my mid 30s and should probably be more settled.\u201d Did you just confess your age? Why would you do that? \u201cSo new career, new change of scenery. A warmer lifestyle.\u201d You said with a bright smile. You bounced on your feet, something you did when you were nervous. </p><p>You left home because you couldn\u2019t handle being in your house anymore. You met Caleb shortly after college and married a couple of years later. You both had stable jobs, a house, but a family never came. You both wanted it but it just wasn\u2019t in the cards for you. He was enough. Together you were enough. 8 years later Caleb was taken from you. A normal trip to the grocery store to grab a few things afterwork and he didn\u2019t make it home. Two policemen were at your door a couple of hours later. They told you Caleb was hit by a red-light runner and didn\u2019t make it. You lived in your house for a year by yourself. You decided to sell and once it sold, you decided to move.</p><p>\u201cChange is good at any age. What kind of career change are you making? Acting?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, God no.\u201d Realizing how bad that sounded you quickly added \u201cI mean, that\u2019s just not for me. I get pretty shy when the attention is on me and I can barely walk and talk at the same time. I\u2019m actually an events coordinator for a PR firm. Well, technically I am an assistant to an events coordinator but I am told that I could easily be moved up within a year. It\u2019s something I dabbled with in college.\u201d</p><p>He started to lift up his eyebrows and opened his mouth but you cut him off. \u201cAnd before you say it, I didn\u2019t plan keggers. I worked on university events like fundraisers.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and nodded his head. \u201cThat\u2019s really cool and I hope it works out for you.\u201d </p><p>Dodger started to whine and Chris looked down at him. \u201cI think he\u2019s ready for dinner and the sun is starting to set. I\u2019m sure you have places to be and we\u2019ve kept you long enough.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m actually just headed home. I don\u2019t really know anyone here yet, so I was just going to go home and Netflix and chill.\u201d Chris started to laugh and you realized your mistake.</p><p>\u201cI mean, watch Netflix and relax before going to bed.

You bounced on your feet, something you did when you were nervous. </p><p>You left home because you couldn&rsquo;t handle being in your house anymore. You met Caleb shortly after college and married a couple of years later. You both had stable jobs, a house, but a family never came. You both wanted it but it just wasn&rsquo;t in the cards for you. He was enough. Together you were enough. 8 years later Caleb was taken from you. A normal trip to the grocery store to grab a few things afterwork and he didn&rsquo;t make it home. Two policemen were at your door a couple of hours later. They told you Caleb was hit by a red-light runner and didn&rsquo;t make it. You lived in your house for a year by yourself. You decided to sell and once it sold, you decided to move.</p><p>&ldquo;Change is good at any age. What kind of career change are you making? Acting?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, God no.&rdquo; Realizing how bad that sounded you quickly added &ldquo;I mean, that&rsquo;s just not for me. I get pretty shy when the attention is on me and I can barely walk and talk at the same time. I&rsquo;m actually an events coordinator for a PR firm. Well, technically I am an assistant to an events coordinator but I am told that I could easily be moved up within a year. It&rsquo;s something I dabbled with in college.&rdquo;</p><p>He started to lift up his eyebrows and opened his mouth but you cut him off. &ldquo;And before you say it, I didn&rsquo;t plan keggers. I worked on university events like fundraisers.&rdquo;</p><p>He smiled and nodded his head. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s really cool and I hope it works out for you.&rdquo; </p><p>Dodger started to whine and Chris looked down at him. &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s ready for dinner and the sun is starting to set. I&rsquo;m sure you have places to be and we&rsquo;ve kept you long enough.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;m actually just headed home. I don&rsquo;t really know anyone here yet, so I was just going to go home and Netflix and chill.&rdquo; Chris started to laugh and you realized your mistake.</p><p>&ldquo;I mean, watch Netflix and relax before going to bed. I don&rsquo;t think I can Netflix and chill by myself.&rdquo; Chris started to laugh again and shake his head. &ldquo;I suppose you could do that by yourself, but that&rsquo;s not what I am doing.&rdquo; You laughed and then let out a big huff of air. You pointed in the direction you were going. &ldquo;I should probably just go.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, you are hilarious and it&rsquo;s been a pleasure meeting you. I thank you for keeping Dodger company for me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It was no problem at all. You have a sweet boy there.&rdquo; Bending down you gave Dodger a scratch behind the ear. You gave a wave to Chris and started to walk out the park, crossing back across the street to the sidewalk.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Y/N!&rdquo; Chris yelled. You turned around and saw Chris and Dodger walking over toward you. </p><p>You stopped walking and turned around. &ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; You asked.</p><p>&ldquo;So, a few friends and I get together once a month and play board games. It&rsquo;s kind of nerdy, but a lot of fun. It&rsquo;s a good group. I know you said you don&rsquo;t have any friends here yet, so would you want to come next time? It&rsquo;s not for a couple of weeks but I can text you when it gets closer to the day. </p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t help but smile a big toothy grin. &ldquo;That would actually be really nice.&rdquo; You said. </p><p>Chris grabbed his phone out of his pocket, unlocked it, and handed it to you. You entered your contact info and handed it back. You didn&rsquo;t text yourself with his phone because you didn&rsquo;t want to assume he would actually follow through. He was already being really nice and you didn&rsquo;t want to be the one to reach out. </p><p>He put his phone back in his pocket and turned to leave. He yelled over his shoulder &ldquo;Talk to you later Y/N.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Bye.&rdquo; You yelled back as you started to walk home. Smiling to yourself you continued on your way. &ldquo;I think I just met Chris Evans.&rdquo;</p><p>Walking up the back stairs to your studio you heard you phone ding. You unlocked the door, walked inside kicking off your shoes. Fishing your phone out of your back pocket you saw that you had a new text. Clicking it open it read &ldquo;Hey Y/N, it&rsquo;s Chris. Just texting so you have my number.&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://jamielea81.tumblr.com/post/183758651502/a-walk-in-the-park-description-when-your-husband\">Chapter 2</a></p></p>",

It was getting late, well, not really. You were more of a homebody these days and since it was after 6, yeah, you should probably get home. You turned back around on the sidewalk and started to walk the 12 or so blocks back to your street. You were trying to walk as much as possible to get to know the area. The LA lifestyle of driving everywhere wasn&rsquo;t your thing. You didn&rsquo;t like driving to begin with and you were never the primary driver back home. Home. What a difference a couple of months can make. </p>\n</p>",

Tilting his head right and left, he stretches out the stiff muscles in his neck, held awkwardly for so long as he was going down on his woman.</p><p><i>His.</i></p><p>Feeling the tightening in his shorts again, he quickly slips out of them and walks to the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she calls out.</p><p>\u201cCondoms,\u201d he answers, rifling through his shaving kit.

It\u2019s not her usual style with a tie at the waist. \u201cCompletely stunning, I hate to ruin it\u2026 But if I can\u2019t figure it out soon enough, I\u2019m just going to rip it from your body.\u201d</p><p>Gasping at the thought, he sees she\u2019s already dripping between her legs. She\u2019ll be wanting him to hurry up. His cock twitches, and he leans over her, rubbing himself against the slick running down her thigh. He bends to lick it, circling his tongue over the small bite mark from his previous play.</p><p>\u201cZipper\u2019s at the neck,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>His hand slides up her spine, gently forcing her down on to her elbows. Draping her wild, curly mane over her shoulder, his long fingers find the tiny zipper and pull down.
