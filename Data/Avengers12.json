I think Tony is depending on his\u00a0\u201claser\u201d power more than do the physical one. so, tome user is fit for him right?. (I also thinking about him being Flier unit but armored seems to fit him the most) his weapon is of course, his armor in which equipped with slows special trigger (+1 to cooldown) and During combat, boosts unit\u2019s attack by number of allies within 2 spaces x 2 (Maximum bonus of +6 to each stat)\u00a0 and Draft idea of the attacking animation, He actually put on the suit and blasting the beam from one hand while his special is using both hands and the center core\u00a0\u201cheart\u201d of him to blast out full power.</p><p>Little of his stat info &mdash;&gt; much like Black knight\u2019s stats but just low in DEF instead of RES\u00a0 or we can say, he\u2019s Red tome Halloween! Henry.</p><p><b>Steve/Captain america = Infantry Blue dagger (before endgame)</b></p><p>- He throws his shield a lot! then, he must be dagger unit! lololol\u00a0 his weapon is Vibranium shield which consist skill of Fort.Def/Res and Close def. the others skill should be focusing on blocking/reduce damage right?</p><p>The stat &mdash;&gt; Balance to all much like Kliff but Dagger unit instead</p><p><b>Thor = Infantry axe</b></p><p>- Also the easy to set with, Thor must absolutely be an axe unit! His weapon has a skill to counter any range unit (he counters them with Thunder strike of course!)\u00a0 and Skill of\u00a0\n\nAccelerates Special Trigger (Cooldown count-1) and deal +10 damage when Special trigger. the little idea of his\u00a0\u201cA slot\u201d skill : Asgardain might = Miracle + ATK/DEF bound</p><p>Stats right? just some draft idea then &mdash;&gt; Quite low in RES and Second lowest SPD of Avengers and average HP but high in DEF and ATK. (he could match Hector(heroes) if he has higher RES but of course not cause he is infantry unit)</p><p><b>Bruce/Hulk = Armored green beast (before endgame)</b></p><p>- Our giant goes to \u201cbeast\u201d cause of \u201ctransformation\u201d thing (I chose the manakete at first but Hulk doesn\u2019t do any Magic attack so&hellip;&hellip;) He is only avengers that has lowest SPD.\u00a0His weapon also allow him to double attack (like brave weapon) and if he transform he even grants more ATK and DEF + can move 1 extra space if HP=100%\u00a0 (I base on Wolfskin and Lionking skill )</p><p>Let\u2019s see if I have any idea for his stat&hellip;.&mdash;&gt;\u00a0 Surtr (heroes) is pretty much of his stat\u00a0\n\n<strike>and the title of strongest avengers still goes to Hulk cause of his stats\u00a0 lololol</strike></p><p><b>Natasha/Black widow = Infantry colorless\u00a0dagger</b></p><p>- Ok, Nat is like an assassin of avengers, but instead of being normal dagger, she has close counter skill and equipped with Swift Sparrow skill , believe or not she is the 2nd fastest of avengers.\u00a0</p><p>Blackwidow\u2019s stat idea &mdash;&gt; Indeed, High ATK and SPD, average HP and low DEF and RES (her RES is trends higher than DEF little bit ) maybe, like Sothe or someone else.</p><p><b>Clint/Hawkeye = infantry colorless</b><b>\u00a0bow\u00a0(before endgame)</b>\n\n</p><p>- In opinion, Thor and Clint are one of perfect match for FE unit, cause they are really easily to find FEclass. ok, let\u2019s get back to the point, Clint is bowman of avengers and his weapon has a skill like\u00a0\u201cBrave weapons\u201d and \u201cSlaying weapons\u201d (multiples attacks and cooldown -1 )\u00a0</p><p>His stats &mdash;&gt; is similar to Nat but more DEF and lower SPD</p><h2><b>(Some of) Other avengers/guardian\u00a0of the galaxy etc.</b></h2><p><b>Big Peter/Star lord = Infantry red dagger</b></p><p>- Because he likes to dance , so you got a \u201cdance\u201d skill Star lord lolololool. Despite being half celestial/human , I don\u2019t think he\u2019s quite a melee fighter but ranged combat one. His dancing also unique : Give away his turn to allies within 1 space but take 10 damage after that&hellip;..(Just for joke = because no one would dance with him which end up thinking that his dancing is the insulting move and&hellip;..)</p><p>Big peter stats or at least I could manage to think of &mdash;&gt; Despite saying he isn\u2019t quite a close-combat fighter, his DEF is trending to be high with balancing HP, SPD and again with low RES (not to mention but his ATK isn\u2019t good neither&hellip;.)</p><p><b>Little Peter/Spiderman =\u00a0 Infantry red beast</b><br/></p><p>- I know he could shoot webs but Peter really can do an actual physical attack and strong. So I set him with beast one and yes, bc he is red (No, he doesn\u2019t transform into a spider just put on his suit ) and unlike beast unit, He still transform (put on the suit) if he adjust only to\u00a0\u201cHuman\u201d ally/ not adjust with any. and His weapon also equipped with\u00a0\u201cNull follow-up\u201d skill (as he can shoot web to prevent another the attack) Still need to find out more skill so, I will add them later</p><p>Our little sunshine stat &mdash;&gt; Average HP, ATK and quite high RES but low in DEF = He is infantry Selkie if you ask lololol this also made him a highest RES of beast unit</p><p><b>Scott/Antman = Infantry red beast </b></p><p>- He could transform so i set him with beast and is red (again) another one of 3 beast units with skill of \u201ctransform if adjust to only \u201chuman\u201d ally / not adjust with any\u201d I also have an idea that his un-transformed attack is he will shrink himself down a punch his enemy in that form while his transformed attack he will transform into giant and punch + stomp his enemy. Also grant +4 ATK/DEF once transform but cannot make a follow-up attack.</p><p>how could I miss his stat\u2019s idea??\u00a0 at first ; w ; &mdash;&gt; I base on Tibarn but as infantry unit =\u00a0 High ATK with balancing DEF, SPD and HP but still Low at Res.</p><p><b>Dr.strange = Flier Blue tome</b></p><p>- My fav mage and Easiest one cause He could fly with cloak of levitation , is blue and can use magic :) I also have an idea of\u00a0\u201cEye of Agamotto\u201d as his A slot skill which has effect of Miracle and \n\nAccelerates Special Trigger (Cooldown count-1) *still need to re-watch his movie so I could give him more perfect skill*</p><p>Supreme mage\u2019s Stats idea &mdash;&gt; like Tony but Lower both DEF and HP much like Nino\u2019s happy twin son, Lugh</p><p><b>Loki = Infantry blue dagger (as seen in Ragnarok used to be Filer green tome in avengers 1 )</b></p><p>- first of all, I LOVE LOKI AND STILL UPSET WHEN HE\u2019S KILLED IN INFINITY WARS!! ; w ;\u00a0 sorry&hellip;..anyway, back to the point, Loki always been with dagger and like to stab :) and he is blue <strike>jotun thing</strike> so I choose blue dagger for him. Is also equipped with close-counter skill , a skill that similar to Ylgr\u2019s \n\nSorcery Blade, but instead of adjust to magic ally, his skill require Physical ally and has ATK/RES bound skill&hellip;.</p><p>He deserve a better stats but all I could think is&hellip;.. &ndash;&gt; High RES and HP (for a dagger unit), average ATK and SPD (higher than Thor) but Low DEF, made him a perfect mage killer</p><p><b>Scarlet witch = Flier Red tome</b></p><p>- Another one powerful unit that can even destroy infinity stone with just her power! I can imagine that she would be a deadliest unit like Nino or Tharja! so I set her as a mage and made her has \u201cblade\u201d like skill as her weapon :)\u00a0</p><p>Scarlet\u2019s stats &mdash;&gt; She has quite high ATK and SPD but low DEF and RES (though RES is little bit higher than DEF) and trends to have lowest HP</p><p><b>Black panther = Cavalry\u00a0colorless beast</b></p><p>- King panther is another beast with unique skill when near his\u00a0\u201chuman\u201d ally , Black panther can run for a pretty long range that I couldn\u2019t see him as any class except cavalry lololol and maybe he has a special like vengeance cause he could absorb/store his enemies\u2019s attack and unleash them out.\u00a0 Why he is colorless? = He is\u00a0\u201cblack panther\u201d, silly.</p><p>King panther skill &mdash;&gt; Much like Panne, balancing ATK, DEF, SPD and HP but\u00a0 Low Res</p><p><b>Carol/Captain marvel = Filer Colorless\u00a0dragon</b></p><p>- Captain marvel is like a god to avengers , She can even withstand many attack without flinch! made her to most powerful unit and Dragon should suit to her!\u00a0 \u201cNo idea of her skill\u201d yet (I need to rewatch captain marvel to study her skill) but her weapon/power should be included the\u00a0\u201ceffect against armored unit\u201d Her attack spite should be like she\u2019s summoning dragon-like aura and attack her enemies&hellip;.</p><p>Her stat? oh, yeah I have\u00a0 little idea here&hellip;.&mdash;-&gt; She should be like Legend! Grima</p><p><b>Sam/Falcon = Flier red beast\u00a0</b></p><p>- Ok, Nothing to fit him but a filer beast unit again lololol Even if there are so many red beast here, I still don\u2019t care XD Another silly idea that I have with him are&hellip;.His weapon is equipped with distant-counter (shoot gun/metal feather on them) and has Tibarn\u2019s Study Impact&hellip;..</p><p>Falcon punc&hellip;.I mean Falcon\u2019s stat &mdash;&gt; Lower SPD than Cap but Higher ATK and DEF, He is actually Tibarn here (more RES than Scott anyway..)</p><p>======================</p><p><b>that\u2019s all for now and thanks for your reading, I will try to add more characters (but of course, if I have inspiration ; w ; ) Feel free to draw / make more fic of this, just tell me if you inspired and wants to use this idea ^w^ (because I\u2019d LOVE to see them &gt;w&lt; )\u00a0</b><br/></p>",

(he could match Hector(heroes) if he has higher RES but of course not cause he is infantry unit)</p><p><b>Bruce/Hulk = Armored green beast (before endgame)</b></p><p>- Our giant goes to &ldquo;beast&rdquo; cause of &ldquo;transformation&rdquo; thing (I chose the manakete at first but Hulk doesn&rsquo;t do any Magic attack so&hellip;&hellip;) He is only avengers that has lowest SPD.&nbsp;His weapon also allow him to double attack (like brave weapon) and if he transform he even grants more ATK and DEF + can move 1 extra space if HP=100%&nbsp; (I base on Wolfskin and Lionking skill )</p><p>Let&rsquo;s see if I have any idea for his stat&hellip;.&mdash;&gt;&nbsp; Surtr (heroes) is pretty much of his stat&nbsp;\n\n<strike>and the title of strongest avengers still goes to Hulk cause of his stats&nbsp; lololol</strike></p><p><b>Natasha/Black widow = Infantry colorless&nbsp;dagger</b></p><p>- Ok, Nat is like an assassin of avengers, but instead of being normal dagger, she has close counter skill and equipped with Swift Sparrow skill , believe or not she is the 2nd fastest of avengers.&nbsp;</p><p>Blackwidow&rsquo;s stat idea &mdash;&gt; Indeed, High ATK and SPD, average HP and low DEF and RES (her RES is trends higher than DEF little bit ) maybe, like Sothe or someone else.</p><p><b>Clint/Hawkeye = infantry colorless</b><b>&nbsp;bow&nbsp;(before endgame)</b>\n\n</p><p>- In opinion, Thor and Clint are one of perfect match for FE unit, cause they are really easily to find FEclass. ok, let&rsquo;s get back to the point, Clint is bowman of avengers and his weapon has a skill like&nbsp;&ldquo;Brave weapons&rdquo; and &ldquo;Slaying weapons&rdquo; (multiples attacks and cooldown -1 )&nbsp;</p><p>His stats &mdash;&gt; is similar to Nat but more DEF and lower SPD</p><h2><b>(Some of) Other avengers/guardian&nbsp;of the galaxy etc.</b></h2><p><b>Big Peter/Star lord = Infantry red dagger</b></p><p>- Because he likes to dance , so you got a &ldquo;dance&rdquo; skill Star lord lolololool. Despite being half celestial/human , I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s quite a melee fighter but ranged combat one. His dancing also unique : Give away his turn to allies within 1 space but take 10 damage after that&hellip;..(Just for joke = because no one would dance with him which end up thinking that his dancing is the insulting move and&hellip;..)</p><p>Big peter stats or at least I could manage to think of &mdash;&gt; Despite saying he isn&rsquo;t quite a close-combat fighter, his DEF is trending to be high with balancing HP, SPD and again with low RES (not to mention but his ATK isn&rsquo;t good neither&hellip;.)</p><p><b>Little Peter/Spiderman =&nbsp; Infantry red beast</b><br /></p><p>- I know he could shoot webs but Peter really can do an actual physical attack and strong. So I set him with beast one and yes, bc he is red (No, he doesn&rsquo;t transform into a spider just put on his suit ) and unlike beast unit, He still transform (put on the suit) if he adjust only to&nbsp;&ldquo;Human&rdquo; ally/ not adjust with any. and His weapon also equipped with&nbsp;&ldquo;Null follow-up&rdquo; skill (as he can shoot web to prevent another the attack) Still need to find out more skill so, I will add them later</p><p>Our little sunshine stat &mdash;&gt; Average HP, ATK and quite high RES but low in DEF = He is infantry Selkie if you ask lololol this also made him a highest RES of beast unit</p><p><b>Scott/Antman = Infantry red beast </b></p><p>- He could transform so i set him with beast and is red (again) another one of 3 beast units with skill of &ldquo;transform if adjust to only &ldquo;human&rdquo; ally / not adjust with any&rdquo; I also have an idea that his un-transformed attack is he will shrink himself down a punch his enemy in that form while his transformed attack he will transform into giant and punch + stomp his enemy. Also grant +4 ATK/DEF once transform but cannot make a follow-up attack.</p><p>how could I miss his stat&rsquo;s idea??&nbsp; at first ; w ; &mdash;&gt; I base on Tibarn but as infantry unit =&nbsp; High ATK with balancing DEF, SPD and HP but still Low at Res.</p><p><b>Dr.strange = Flier Blue tome</b></p><p>- My fav mage and Easiest one cause He could fly with cloak of levitation , is blue and can use magic :) I also have an idea of&nbsp;&ldquo;Eye of Agamotto&rdquo; as his A slot skill which has effect of Miracle and \n\nAccelerates Special Trigger (Cooldown count-1) *still need to re-watch his movie so I could give him more perfect skill*</p><p>Supreme mage&rsquo;s Stats idea &mdash;&gt; like Tony but Lower both DEF and HP much like Nino&rsquo;s happy twin son, Lugh</p><p><b>Loki = Infantry blue dagger (as seen in Ragnarok used to be Filer green tome in avengers 1 )</b></p><p>- first of all, I LOVE LOKI AND STILL UPSET WHEN HE&rsquo;S KILLED IN INFINITY WARS!! ; w ;&nbsp; sorry&hellip;..anyway, back to the point, Loki always been with dagger and like to stab :) and he is blue <strike>jotun thing</strike> so I choose blue dagger for him. Is also equipped with close-counter skill , a skill that similar to Ylgr&rsquo;s \n\nSorcery Blade, but instead of adjust to magic ally, his skill require Physical ally and has ATK/RES bound skill&hellip;.</p><p>He deserve a better stats but all I could think is&hellip;.. &ndash;&gt; High RES and HP (for a dagger unit), average ATK and SPD (higher than Thor) but Low DEF, made him a perfect mage killer</p><p><b>Scarlet witch = Flier Red tome</b></p><p>- Another one powerful unit that can even destroy infinity stone with just her power! I can imagine that she would be a deadliest unit like Nino or Tharja! so I set her as a mage and made her has &ldquo;blade&rdquo; like skill as her weapon :)&nbsp;</p><p>Scarlet&rsquo;s stats &mdash;&gt; She has quite high ATK and SPD but low DEF and RES (though RES is little bit higher than DEF) and trends to have lowest HP</p><p><b>Black panther = Cavalry&nbsp;colorless beast</b></p><p>- King panther is another beast with unique skill when near his&nbsp;&ldquo;human&rdquo; ally , Black panther can run for a pretty long range that I couldn&rsquo;t see him as any class except cavalry lololol and maybe he has a special like vengeance cause he could absorb/store his enemies&rsquo;s attack and unleash them out.&nbsp; Why he is colorless? = He is&nbsp;&ldquo;black panther&rdquo;, silly.</p><p>King panther skill &mdash;&gt; Much like Panne, balancing ATK, DEF, SPD and HP but&nbsp; Low Res</p><p><b>Carol/Captain marvel = Filer Colorless&nbsp;dragon</b></p><p>- Captain marvel is like a god to avengers , She can even withstand many attack without flinch! made her to most powerful unit and Dragon should suit to her!&nbsp; &ldquo;No idea of her skill&rdquo; yet (I need to rewatch captain marvel to study her skill) but her weapon/power should be included the&nbsp;&ldquo;effect against armored unit&rdquo; Her attack spite should be like she&rsquo;s summoning dragon-like aura and attack her enemies&hellip;.</p><p>Her stat? oh, yeah I have&nbsp; little idea here&hellip;.&mdash;-&gt; She should be like Legend! Grima</p><p><b>Sam/Falcon = Flier red beast&nbsp;</b></p><p>- Ok, Nothing to fit him but a filer beast unit again lololol Even if there are so many red beast here, I still don&rsquo;t care XD Another silly idea that I have with him are&hellip;.His weapon is equipped with distant-counter (shoot gun/metal feather on them) and has Tibarn&rsquo;s Study Impact&hellip;..</p><p>Falcon punc&hellip;.I mean Falcon&rsquo;s stat &mdash;&gt; Lower SPD than Cap but Higher ATK and DEF, He is actually Tibarn here (more RES than Scott anyway..)</p><p>======================</p><p><b>that&rsquo;s all for now and thanks for your reading, I will try to add more characters (but of course, if I have inspiration ; w ; ) Feel free to draw / make more fic of this, just tell me if you inspired and wants to use this idea ^w^ (because I&rsquo;d LOVE to see them &gt;w&lt; )&nbsp;</b><br /></p>",

On April 26, Marvel&rsquo;s Avengers: Endgame hit the screens which became a blockbuster in just 2 weeks and broke many records.</p><p>Pinkvilla got in touch with Trade Analyst Girish Johar to know the first day box office prediction of SOTY 2 and whether Avengers: Endgame will affect its business. Girish Johar told Pinkvilla, &ldquo;Student of The Year 2 is coming from a successful franchise. Last time it launched Varun Dhawan, Alia Bhatt and Sidharth Malhotra. This time, it is launching Tara Sutaria and Ananya Panday. Tiger is already an established star himself. So the excitement level is quite huge so, it&rsquo;s going to be a completely peppy, energetic and youthful film for the youngsters. The songs are also good&rdquo;.\u00a0</p><p>Girish further added, &ldquo;I feel after 2 weeks of Avengers: Endgame, SOTY 2 will have a good start at the box office. I somewhere peg the film to be anywhere around 12-13 crores. If the film has good word of mouth, it can change the gear in a later day and can touch around 14-15 crores. If the content is not exciting or entertaining, it can fall around 10-crore. Avengers has already crossed a whopping 300-crores mark and it has done a fantastic business already in 2 weeks&rdquo;.\u00a0</p><p>He also said that Avengers: Endgame won&rsquo;t affect SOTY 2&rsquo;s business if it&rsquo;s a good film. He said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Avengers is going to be a big threat to SOTY 2. It can only be a threat if SOTY 2 is completely trashed out by reviews or word of mouth like Kalank. People didn&rsquo;t like Kalank, so the evening shows got affected. But there&rsquo;s a mere change that SOTY 2 will be affected as from the trailer, it can be sensed that it is quite an energetic, peppy and entertaining kind of film. Youth will go at least once over the weekend. If they find\u00a0 the content interesting and they like it, it has a good chance at the box office for sure.&rdquo;</p><p>Also Read: <b><a href=\"https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/music/soty-2-tara-sutaria-tries-impress-desi-munda-tiger-shroff-latest-track-jatt-ludhiyane-da-449695#\">SOTY 2: Tara Sutaria tries to impress the Desi Munda Tiger Shroff in the latest track &lsquo;Jatt Ludhiyane da&rsquo;</a></b></p>",
