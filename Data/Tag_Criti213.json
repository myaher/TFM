he wants to be thought of as a terrible human being. a true scum of the earth. that&rsquo;s the only way he thinks he&rsquo;d be able to atone.</li>\n\n<ul><li>honestly? this is largely why i&rsquo;m terrified of someone like jester finding out. not because she&rsquo;d react poorly, but because <i>he</i> will. he&rsquo;s convinced he doesn&rsquo;t deserve jester&rsquo;s kindness or her friendship. like i said, she&rsquo;s more or less everything he wanted and everything he failed on. being around jester is like trying to stare at the sun literally all the time for him, and i don&rsquo;t mean that in a good way</li></ul><ul><li>but he&rsquo;s doing it because that&rsquo;s what caleb does. constantly punishing himself because he thinks he deserves it. like y'all.</li></ul></ul><ul><li>he&rsquo;s thought this way for 30+ years of his life, even if he wasn&rsquo;t entirely &ldquo;himself&rdquo; for a lot of those years. <b>he&rsquo;s absolutely the victim in this scenario, but no one has told him that.</b> so he&rsquo;s going to continue to believe it until something really big comes along to convince him otherwise.</li>\n\n<ul><li>i say no one because he won&rsquo;t <i>count</i> anyone. not beau, not nott, not anyone. he cares about nott and thinks beau&rsquo;s great, but they weren&rsquo;t around when caleb studied under ikithon. he cannot believe their words because to him? they don&rsquo;t know everything. they don&rsquo;t know how awful he really was.</li></ul><ul><li>he&rsquo;ll make every excuse to void every opinion. his parents ( they&rsquo;re his parents, even if he doesn&rsquo;t deserve them ), eodwulf and astrid ( still not close enough ), or ikithon ( lmao as if ikithon would say it ), the rest of the nein. i really don&rsquo;t want to downplay how much caleb hates himself, because god it&rsquo;s intense.</li></ul></ul><ul><li>here&rsquo;s the thing: <b>caleb&rsquo;s self-loathing is out of this world, but he&rsquo;s still incredibly sure of himself</b>. he knows he&rsquo;s smart, knows his strengths, and will absolutely use all of them. he hates the man that ikithon molded himself to be, but that won&rsquo;t stop him from using all the tactics he learned then.</li>\n\n<ul><li>guys i joke about the infamous &ldquo;buuuuuuut&rdquo; a lot with my friends but the context behind it is horrifiying?? this man is not above torture to get whatever he needs.</li></ul></ul><ul><li>it&rsquo;s largely why it&rsquo;s really, really difficult to shake him out of his self-loathing. because he&rsquo;s smart, because he&rsquo;s extremely &hellip; confident? in his smarts and abilities. because he <i>knows</i> that he is an awful person ( regardless of whether that&rsquo;s objectively true ), and no one else can shake him from his belief.</li>\n\n<ul><li>it&rsquo;s why i like him so much, tbh; he&rsquo;s very, very stubborn, but in ways that you don&rsquo;t really expect.</li></ul></ul></ul><ul><li>god okay this seems out of the blue but hear me out, because liam&rsquo;s playing a D&amp;D faux-pas in a really amazing way?? <b>he&rsquo;s playing a character who doesn&rsquo;t want to be in a party</b>. i&rsquo;m convinced liam o'brien sits at home figuring out the best way to subvert tropes and puts them into his characters.</li>\n\n<ul><li>if caleb could do everything he thinks he needs to do, he wouldn&rsquo;t have nott by his side. he wouldn&rsquo;t be with the mighty nein. he&rsquo;d fuck off and then mess with the very fabric of time however he&rsquo;d like!! but he knows he is one hobo dude possibly wanted by a very powerful, very evil wizard. he won&rsquo;t get anywhere without at least some people beside him.</li>\n\n<ul><li>he doesn&rsquo;t want to be in this party. he doesn&rsquo;t want to make connections with these people. if he could, he&rsquo;d leave in a heartbeat &ndash; but the reason he can&rsquo;t leave isn&rsquo;t necessarily because he&rsquo;s attached to them; though that is a part of it. it&rsquo;s because he knows he&rsquo;s stronger with them. and he needs to be stronger.</li></ul></ul><ul><li>so what does this have anything to do with caleb&rsquo;s mental state? </li></ul><ul><li><b>caleb is not the emotional glue holding this party together</b>. that implies he&rsquo;s allowing himself to get attached to people. he&rsquo;s not jester or nott ( or even beau! ) who can do that naturally; he needs to expend energy to do it. except he&rsquo;s so busy convincing himself he <i>shouldn&rsquo;t</i> be forming deep relationships that he doesn&rsquo;t have the capacity to accept that from other people, let alone extend that kind of emotional support to his friends.</li>\n\n<ul><li>but boy, does he need the people. not emotionally, but practically. and <b>if we know anything about caleb, it&rsquo;s that he&rsquo;s ambitious enough to do whatever needs to be done to achieve his goals</b>. so &hellip; that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s doing.</li>\n\n<ul><li>he buys drinks for people very often. in fact, he spends almost all his money (that hasn&rsquo;t gone to ink &amp; paper) on other people he needs to befriend. he sits down to speak to people who seem to be going through any kind of conflict in an attempt to keep them here ( jester, when they fought over money. fjord, after scroll gate. beau, after bowl gate. caduceus when he looked like he wanted to leave. ). he&rsquo;s always complimenting the people around him ( jester and caduceus are the best clerics, fjord is the face of the group, nott is extremely intelligent and fast, beau and yasha are the strongest, etc. )</li></ul><ul><li><b>he&rsquo;s doing all of this to keep these people close to him.</b> i wouldn&rsquo;t say he&rsquo;s manipulating them, because to some degree, he does care about them now! and this isn&rsquo;t necessarily done with malicious intent. but to say that all these things are done out of altruism or compassion would be wrong. if there was a very, very good reason for him to leave this group of people, he would do it.</li></ul></ul></ul><ul><li>the point i&rsquo;m trying to make is that caleb still puts himself and his goals before the rest of the mighty nein &ndash; <b>as of now, he doesn&rsquo;t have the mental capacity to even think of that</b>. which, typically, is found in character who don&rsquo;t want to be in a party; but liam has molded caleb&rsquo;s circumstances in a way where he <i>needs</i> this party to achieve his goals. so he&rsquo;s sticking around. and i think that&rsquo;s absolutely brilliant. i&rsquo;m terrified of what&rsquo;s going to happen next, but i&rsquo;m 10000% here for the ride.</li></ul></ul><hr><p>i wanted to add more but this is already 1200 words, i&rsquo;m going to exercise something called self-restraint for once ( 1200 words&hellip; later&hellip;.. look i never claimed to be perfect ).</p>",

</li></ul><ul><li><b>caleb is not the emotional glue holding this party together</b>. that implies he&rsquo;s allowing himself to get attached to people. he&rsquo;s not jester or nott ( or even beau! ) who can do that naturally; he needs to expend energy to do it. except he&rsquo;s so busy convincing himself he <i>shouldn&rsquo;t</i> be forming deep relationships that he doesn&rsquo;t have the capacity to accept that from other people, let alone extend that kind of emotional support to his friends.</li>\n\n<ul><li>but boy, does he need the people. not emotionally, but practically. and <b>if we know anything about caleb, it&rsquo;s that he&rsquo;s ambitious enough to do whatever needs to be done to achieve his goals</b>. so &hellip; that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s doing.</li>\n\n<ul><li>he buys drinks for people very often. in fact, he spends almost all his money (that hasn&rsquo;t gone to ink &amp; paper) on other people he needs to befriend. he sits down to speak to people who seem to be going through any kind of conflict in an attempt to keep them here ( jester, when they fought over money. fjord, after scroll gate. beau, after bowl gate. caduceus when he looked like he wanted to leave. ). he&rsquo;s always complimenting the people around him ( jester and caduceus are the best clerics, fjord is the face of the group, nott is extremely intelligent and fast, beau and yasha are the strongest, etc. )</li></ul><ul><li><b>he&rsquo;s doing all of this to keep these people close to him.</b> i wouldn&rsquo;t say he&rsquo;s manipulating them, because to some degree, he does care about them now! and this isn&rsquo;t necessarily done with malicious intent. but to say that all these things are done out of altruism or compassion would be wrong. if there was a very, very good reason for him to leave this group of people, he would do it.</li></ul></ul></ul><ul><li>the point i&rsquo;m trying to make is that caleb still puts himself and his goals before the rest of the mighty nein &ndash; <b>as of now, he doesn&rsquo;t have the mental capacity to even think of that</b>. which, typically, is found in character who don&rsquo;t want to be in a party; but liam has molded caleb&rsquo;s circumstances in a way where he <i>needs</i> this party to achieve his goals. so he&rsquo;s sticking around. and i think that&rsquo;s absolutely brilliant. i&rsquo;m terrified of what&rsquo;s going to happen next, but i&rsquo;m 10000% here for the ride.</li></ul></ul><hr /><p>i wanted to add more but this is already 1200 words, i&rsquo;m going to exercise something called self-restraint for once ( 1200 words&hellip; later&hellip;.. look i never claimed to be perfect ).</p>",
