        "body": "<p><b>Previously on BnHA:</b>\nDeku had a freaky dream! All the previous wielders of OFA were there (although we couldn\u2019t see all of them clearly), and there was an epic flashback starring\u00a0the first one, All For One\u2019s\nBrother. He spent most of the flashback screaming at All for One to stop toying with people and using them for his own purposes. AFO spent most\nof the flashback ignoring his brother completely and being a bad bitch. He built an army of loyal followers who eventually\ngrew bold enough to start taking violent and even lethal action\nagainst AFO\u2019s enemies. Then one day he came to see his little bro again, and they\ntalked about an old comic they read as children. AFO was inspired by the\nvillain in the story, but his bro identified with the story\u2019s hero, who never\ngave up in spite of the struggle, until he finally won and saved everyone. AFO\nwas all \u201cwell that\u2019s just a story,\u201d which was some great fucking irony right\nthere, and then he bestowed his brother with a quirk, thus unknowingly sealing\nhis own doom. OFA Primo then turned to Deku <i>and\nstarted talking to him</i>, telling him there was more he wanted to show him\nbut that this was all he could manage right now.\nBut he told Deku \u201cyou are not alone.\u201d And then Deku woke himself up by\nactivating some sort of new power in his hand, inadvertently destroying half of\nhis fucking room in the process.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> Deku tells All Might about the dream and about how OFA Primo spoke to him. All Might says he\u2019s seen the\u00a0\u201cVestiges\u201d of One for All in the past, but that they\u2019d never communicated with him. Shimura had told him about that phenomenon though. Apparently the wills of the past OFA wielders are contained within the quirk as part of its power. But All Might has no clue regarding the explosion that took place when Deku woke up, and he tells Deku that for now, they\u2019ll search for the answers together. As Deku heads off to his afternoon training session, he runs into Aizawa and Shinsou in the hall. We then cut to the industrial training ground area, where class 1-A shows off their various cold weather gear, including Katsuki, who\u2019s got almost a whole new look going on and I love it and never want him to go back tbh. Class 1-B then joins them, and we learn that today\u2019s class will be a joint training exercise. Oh, and there\u2019s going to be a special guest &ndash; Shinsou, who is still trying to transfer into the hero department. And he\u2019s also sporting a familiar-looking capture scarf around his neck.</p><p><br/></p><p>(As always, all comments not marked with an ETA are my mostly-unspoiled reactions from my first readthrough of this chapter.

I\u2019m starting to\nthink of it in Avatar: The Last Airbender terms now lol. All Might was more of\na Korra while Deku is an Aang</li></ul><p>(ETA: and you know, I think that analogy can even be stretched to their respective coming-of-age processes as well. like Korra, All Might went through the normal training process and was given time to master his power. but Deku is more like Aang in that he hasn\u2019t had that same benefit of being able to learn all of this gradually. like Aang, he\u2019s kind of been thrust right into the thick of things before he was fully prepared for it, and a lot of his growth has been of the trial by fire variety.</p><p>and this is only going to get worse from here, because the League of Villains is not going to wait until little All Might Jr. is all grown up before making their move. Deku is going to be put to the test <i>soon</i>, and he won\u2019t be ready for it, and he\u2019ll have to do it anyway because the fate of the world may depend on it. I know the whole SIXQUIRKS thing potentially looks like a massively overpowered upgrade at first glance, but the thing is that he\u2019s still a kid, and he has <i>no idea</i> how to use this shit. look at how much he\u2019s struggled learning how to use just <i>one </i>quirk without killing himself. now throw in six new ones with no training manual. and on top of that they\u2019ve all been cranked up to 11 thanks to that quirk singularity&trade; shit. basically it\u2019s going to be a hot fucking mess that will probably get him into as much trouble as it helps get him out of. he\u2019s still going to be figuring out what percentages he can safely use, and he\u2019ll be forced to put his Big Hero Brain to the test in new and fascinating ways as he comes up with strategies to use whatever he does manage to figure out.</p><p>and meanwhile he\u2019ll be up against Tomura and the League and &ndash; eventually &ndash; AFO himself. much like Aang inevitably had to take on Ozai even though he was only 12 years old and his training wasn\u2019t complete. I\u2019m anticipating something similar for Deku in the endgame here, and I think it\u2019s going to be an amazing ride and I can\u2019t wait.)</p><ul><li>so now Deku is smiling and he says he\u2019ll do his best</li><li>oh!</li><li>;_;</li></ul><p><br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"538\" data-orig-height=\"322\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e537eed0d68c437044806891a71b441b/tumblr_inline_posds2e3OF1r1uxj5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"538\" data-orig-height=\"322\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"766\" data-orig-height=\"218\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/778b14af2eea61dfca8d6b4d8e839323/tumblr_inline_posdschK6D1r1uxj5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"766\" data-orig-height=\"218\"/></figure><p><br/></p><ul><li>;_______;</li><li>(1) THIS IS THE PUREST INTERACTION THAT\u2019S EVER GRACED THIS\nMANGA\u2019S PAGES, and (2) HELL YEAH SHE FUCKING WAS</li><li>(ETA: this makes me so fucking sad now because I\u2019m sure All Might would give anything to be able to see and talk to Shimura again one last time. if Horikoshi does kill him off I hope he gets to see her first.)</li><li>so now they\u2019re heading out and All Might\u2019s escorting Deku to\nhis next class and says he\u2019s gonna watch and that it seems like it\u2019ll be fun</li><li>and they\u2019re running into Aizawa who\u2019s stepping out into the\nhall himself</li><li>OH SHIT</li></ul><p><br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"512\" data-orig-height=\"715\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6ac4eb4dd29c9cf9bb3f0cf3eb0cb127/tumblr_inline_posduoK6uT1r1uxj5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"512\" data-orig-height=\"715\"/></figure><p><br/></p><ul><li>WAS HE JUST MEETING WITH SHINSOU??</li><li>okay but I\u2019m pretty sure Shinsou hasn\u2019t been accepted into\nthe hero program yet? <strike>because truthfully this is another thing I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve been spoiled for, though that was kind of an inevitable development so to me it\u2019s not a huge spoiler. but anyways pretty sure that won\u2019t happen until around chapter 216 though</strike>\u00a0so this meeting can\u2019t have been about that</li><li>given that this is not the first time we\u2019ve seen these two\ntogether, I think we can assume that Aizawa has been mentoring him off and on?

I\u2019m starting to\nthink of it in Avatar: The Last Airbender terms now lol. All Might was more of\na Korra while Deku is an Aang</li></ul><p>(ETA: and you know, I think that analogy can even be stretched to their respective coming-of-age processes as well. like Korra, All Might went through the normal training process and was given time to master his power. but Deku is more like Aang in that he hasn\u2019t had that same benefit of being able to learn all of this gradually. like Aang, he\u2019s kind of been thrust right into the thick of things before he was fully prepared for it, and a lot of his growth has been of the trial by fire variety.</p><p>and this is only going to get worse from here, because the League of Villains is not going to wait until little All Might Jr. is all grown up before making their move. Deku is going to be put to the test <i>soon</i>, and he won\u2019t be ready for it, and he\u2019ll have to do it anyway because the fate of the world may depend on it. I know the whole SIXQUIRKS thing potentially looks like a massively overpowered upgrade at first glance, but the thing is that he\u2019s still a kid, and he has <i>no idea</i> how to use this shit. look at how much he\u2019s struggled learning how to use just <i>one </i>quirk without killing himself. now throw in six new ones with no training manual. and on top of that they\u2019ve all been cranked up to 11 thanks to that quirk singularity\u2122 shit. basically it\u2019s going to be a hot fucking mess that will probably get him into as much trouble as it helps get him out of. he\u2019s still going to be figuring out what percentages he can safely use, and he\u2019ll be forced to put his Big Hero Brain to the test in new and fascinating ways as he comes up with strategies to use whatever he does manage to figure out.</p><p>and meanwhile he\u2019ll be up against Tomura and the League and \u2013 eventually \u2013 AFO himself. much like Aang inevitably had to take on Ozai even though he was only 12 years old and his training wasn\u2019t complete. I\u2019m anticipating something similar for Deku in the endgame here, and I think it\u2019s going to be an amazing ride and I can\u2019t wait.)</p><ul><li>so now Deku is smiling and he says he\u2019ll do his best</li><li>oh!</li><li>;_;</li></ul><p><br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"538\" data-orig-height=\"322\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e537eed0d68c437044806891a71b441b/tumblr_inline_posds2e3OF1r1uxj5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"538\" data-orig-height=\"322\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"766\" data-orig-height=\"218\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/778b14af2eea61dfca8d6b4d8e839323/tumblr_inline_posdschK6D1r1uxj5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"766\" data-orig-height=\"218\"></figure><p><br></p><ul><li>;_______;</li><li>(1) THIS IS THE PUREST INTERACTION THAT\u2019S EVER GRACED THIS\nMANGA\u2019S PAGES, and (2) HELL YEAH SHE FUCKING WAS</li><li>(ETA: this makes me so fucking sad now because I\u2019m sure All Might would give anything to be able to see and talk to Shimura again one last time. if Horikoshi does kill him off I hope he gets to see her first.)</li><li>so now they\u2019re heading out and All Might\u2019s escorting Deku to\nhis next class and says he\u2019s gonna watch and that it seems like it\u2019ll be fun</li><li>and they\u2019re running into Aizawa who\u2019s stepping out into the\nhall himself</li><li>OH SHIT</li></ul><p><br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"512\" data-orig-height=\"715\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6ac4eb4dd29c9cf9bb3f0cf3eb0cb127/tumblr_inline_posduoK6uT1r1uxj5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"512\" data-orig-height=\"715\"></figure><p><br></p><ul><li>WAS HE JUST MEETING WITH SHINSOU??</li><li>okay but I\u2019m pretty sure Shinsou hasn\u2019t been accepted into\nthe hero program yet? <strike>because truthfully this is another thing I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve been spoiled for, though that was kind of an inevitable development so to me it\u2019s not a huge spoiler. but anyways pretty sure that won\u2019t happen until around chapter 216 though</strike>\u00a0so this meeting can\u2019t have been about that</li><li>given that this is not the first time we\u2019ve seen these two\ntogether, I think we can assume that Aizawa has been mentoring him off and on?

All the previous wielders of OFA were there (although we couldn\u2019t see all of them clearly), and there was an epic flashback starring\u00a0the first one, All For One\u2019s\nBrother. He spent most of the flashback screaming at All for One to stop toying with people and using them for his own purposes. AFO spent most\nof the flashback ignoring his brother completely and being a bad bitch. He built an army of loyal followers who eventually\ngrew bold enough to start taking violent and even lethal action\nagainst AFO\u2019s enemies. Then one day he came to see his little bro again, and they\ntalked about an old comic they read as children. AFO was inspired by the\nvillain in the story, but his bro identified with the story\u2019s hero, who never\ngave up in spite of the struggle, until he finally won and saved everyone. AFO\nwas all \u201cwell that\u2019s just a story,\u201d which was some great fucking irony right\nthere, and then he bestowed his brother with a quirk, thus unknowingly sealing\nhis own doom. OFA Primo then turned to Deku <i>and\nstarted talking to him</i>, telling him there was more he wanted to show him\nbut that this was all he could manage right now.\nBut he told Deku \u201cyou are not alone.\u201d And then Deku woke himself up by\nactivating some sort of new power in his hand, inadvertently destroying half of\nhis fucking room in the process.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> Deku tells All Might about the dream and about how OFA Primo spoke to him. All Might says he\u2019s seen the\u00a0\u201cVestiges\u201d of One for All in the past, but that they\u2019d never communicated with him. Shimura had told him about that phenomenon though. Apparently the wills of the past OFA wielders are contained within the quirk as part of its power. But All Might has no clue regarding the explosion that took place when Deku woke up, and he tells Deku that for now, they\u2019ll search for the answers together. As Deku heads off to his afternoon training session, he runs into Aizawa and Shinsou in the hall. We then cut to the industrial training ground area, where class 1-A shows off their various cold weather gear, including Katsuki, who\u2019s got almost a whole new look going on and I love it and never want him to go back tbh. Class 1-B then joins them, and we learn that today\u2019s class will be a joint training exercise. Oh, and there\u2019s going to be a special guest \u2013 Shinsou, who is still trying to transfer into the hero department. And he\u2019s also sporting a familiar-looking capture scarf around his neck.</p><p><br></p><p>(As always, all comments not marked with an ETA are my mostly-unspoiled reactions from my first readthrough of this chapter.

I\u2019m starting to\nthink of it in Avatar: The Last Airbender terms now lol. All Might was more of\na Korra while Deku is an Aang</li></ul><p>(ETA: and you know, I think that analogy can even be stretched to their respective coming-of-age processes as well. like Korra, All Might went through the normal training process and was given time to master his power. but Deku is more like Aang in that he hasn\u2019t had that same benefit of being able to learn all of this gradually. like Aang, he\u2019s kind of been thrust right into the thick of things before he was fully prepared for it, and a lot of his growth has been of the trial by fire variety.</p><p>and this is only going to get worse from here, because the League of Villains is not going to wait until little All Might Jr. is all grown up before making their move. Deku is going to be put to the test <i>soon</i>, and he won\u2019t be ready for it, and he\u2019ll have to do it anyway because the fate of the world may depend on it. I know the whole SIXQUIRKS thing potentially looks like a massively overpowered upgrade at first glance, but the thing is that he\u2019s still a kid, and he has <i>no idea</i> how to use this shit. look at how much he\u2019s struggled learning how to use just <i>one </i>quirk without killing himself. now throw in six new ones with no training manual. and on top of that they\u2019ve all been cranked up to 11 thanks to that quirk singularity\u2122 shit. basically it\u2019s going to be a hot fucking mess that will probably get him into as much trouble as it helps get him out of. he\u2019s still going to be figuring out what percentages he can safely use, and he\u2019ll be forced to put his Big Hero Brain to the test in new and fascinating ways as he comes up with strategies to use whatever he does manage to figure out.</p><p>and meanwhile he\u2019ll be up against Tomura and the League and \u2013 eventually \u2013 AFO himself. much like Aang inevitably had to take on Ozai even though he was only 12 years old and his training wasn\u2019t complete. I\u2019m anticipating something similar for Deku in the endgame here, and I think it\u2019s going to be an amazing ride and I can\u2019t wait.)</p><ul><li>so now Deku is smiling and he says he\u2019ll do his best</li><li>oh!</li><li>;_;</li></ul><p><br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"538\" data-orig-height=\"322\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e537eed0d68c437044806891a71b441b/tumblr_inline_posds2e3OF1r1uxj5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"538\" data-orig-height=\"322\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"766\" data-orig-height=\"218\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/778b14af2eea61dfca8d6b4d8e839323/tumblr_inline_posdschK6D1r1uxj5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"766\" data-orig-height=\"218\"></figure><p><br></p><ul><li>;_______;</li><li>(1) THIS IS THE PUREST INTERACTION THAT\u2019S EVER GRACED THIS\nMANGA\u2019S PAGES, and (2) HELL YEAH SHE FUCKING WAS</li><li>(ETA: this makes me so fucking sad now because I\u2019m sure All Might would give anything to be able to see and talk to Shimura again one last time. if Horikoshi does kill him off I hope he gets to see her first.)</li><li>so now they\u2019re heading out and All Might\u2019s escorting Deku to\nhis next class and says he\u2019s gonna watch and that it seems like it\u2019ll be fun</li><li>and they\u2019re running into Aizawa who\u2019s stepping out into the\nhall himself</li><li>OH SHIT</li></ul><p><br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"512\" data-orig-height=\"715\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6ac4eb4dd29c9cf9bb3f0cf3eb0cb127/tumblr_inline_posduoK6uT1r1uxj5_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"512\" data-orig-height=\"715\"></figure><p><br></p><ul><li>WAS HE JUST MEETING WITH SHINSOU??</li><li>okay but I\u2019m pretty sure Shinsou hasn\u2019t been accepted into\nthe hero program yet? <strike>because truthfully this is another thing I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve been spoiled for, though that was kind of an inevitable development so to me it\u2019s not a huge spoiler. but anyways pretty sure that won\u2019t happen until around chapter 216 though</strike>\u00a0so this meeting can\u2019t have been about that</li><li>given that this is not the first time we\u2019ve seen these two\ntogether, I think we can assume that Aizawa has been mentoring him off and on?

                "content": "<p><b>Previously on BnHA:</b>\nDeku had a freaky dream! All the previous wielders of OFA were there (although we couldn&rsquo;t see all of them clearly), and there was an epic flashback starring&nbsp;the first one, All For One&rsquo;s\nBrother. He spent most of the flashback screaming at All for One to stop toying with people and using them for his own purposes. AFO spent most\nof the flashback ignoring his brother completely and being a bad bitch. He built an army of loyal followers who eventually\ngrew bold enough to start taking violent and even lethal action\nagainst AFO&rsquo;s enemies. Then one day he came to see his little bro again, and they\ntalked about an old comic they read as children. AFO was inspired by the\nvillain in the story, but his bro identified with the story&rsquo;s hero, who never\ngave up in spite of the struggle, until he finally won and saved everyone. AFO\nwas all &ldquo;well that&rsquo;s just a story,&rdquo; which was some great fucking irony right\nthere, and then he bestowed his brother with a quirk, thus unknowingly sealing\nhis own doom. OFA Primo then turned to Deku <i>and\nstarted talking to him</i>, telling him there was more he wanted to show him\nbut that this was all he could manage right now.\nBut he told Deku &ldquo;you are not alone.&rdquo; And then Deku woke himself up by\nactivating some sort of new power in his hand, inadvertently destroying half of\nhis fucking room in the process.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> Deku tells All Might about the dream and about how OFA Primo spoke to him. All Might says he&rsquo;s seen the&nbsp;&ldquo;Vestiges&rdquo; of One for All in the past, but that they&rsquo;d never communicated with him. Shimura had told him about that phenomenon though. Apparently the wills of the past OFA wielders are contained within the quirk as part of its power. But All Might has no clue regarding the explosion that took place when Deku woke up, and he tells Deku that for now, they&rsquo;ll search for the answers together. As Deku heads off to his afternoon training session, he runs into Aizawa and Shinsou in the hall. We then cut to the industrial training ground area, where class 1-A shows off their various cold weather gear, including Katsuki, who&rsquo;s got almost a whole new look going on and I love it and never want him to go back tbh. Class 1-B then joins them, and we learn that today&rsquo;s class will be a joint training exercise. Oh, and there&rsquo;s going to be a special guest &ndash; Shinsou, who is still trying to transfer into the hero department. And he&rsquo;s also sporting a familiar-looking capture scarf around his neck.</p><p><br /></p><p>(As always, all comments not marked with an ETA are my mostly-unspoiled reactions from my first readthrough of this chapter.

I&rsquo;m starting to\nthink of it in Avatar: The Last Airbender terms now lol. All Might was more of\na Korra while Deku is an Aang</li></ul><p>(ETA: and you know, I think that analogy can even be stretched to their respective coming-of-age processes as well. like Korra, All Might went through the normal training process and was given time to master his power. but Deku is more like Aang in that he hasn&rsquo;t had that same benefit of being able to learn all of this gradually. like Aang, he&rsquo;s kind of been thrust right into the thick of things before he was fully prepared for it, and a lot of his growth has been of the trial by fire variety.</p><p>and this is only going to get worse from here, because the League of Villains is not going to wait until little All Might Jr. is all grown up before making their move. Deku is going to be put to the test <i>soon</i>, and he won&rsquo;t be ready for it, and he&rsquo;ll have to do it anyway because the fate of the world may depend on it. I know the whole SIXQUIRKS thing potentially looks like a massively overpowered upgrade at first glance, but the thing is that he&rsquo;s still a kid, and he has <i>no idea</i> how to use this shit. look at how much he&rsquo;s struggled learning how to use just <i>one </i>quirk without killing himself. now throw in six new ones with no training manual. and on top of that they&rsquo;ve all been cranked up to 11 thanks to that quirk singularity&trade; shit. basically it&rsquo;s going to be a hot fucking mess that will probably get him into as much trouble as it helps get him out of. he&rsquo;s still going to be figuring out what percentages he can safely use, and he&rsquo;ll be forced to put his Big Hero Brain to the test in new and fascinating ways as he comes up with strategies to use whatever he does manage to figure out.</p><p>and meanwhile he&rsquo;ll be up against Tomura and the League and &ndash; eventually &ndash; AFO himself. much like Aang inevitably had to take on Ozai even though he was only 12 years old and his training wasn&rsquo;t complete.

                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p><b>Previously on BnHA:</b>\nDeku had a freaky dream! All the previous wielders of OFA were there (although we couldn&rsquo;t see all of them clearly), and there was an epic flashback starring&nbsp;the first one, All For One&rsquo;s\nBrother. He spent most of the flashback screaming at All for One to stop toying with people and using them for his own purposes. AFO spent most\nof the flashback ignoring his brother completely and being a bad bitch. He built an army of loyal followers who eventually\ngrew bold enough to start taking violent and even lethal action\nagainst AFO&rsquo;s enemies. Then one day he came to see his little bro again, and they\ntalked about an old comic they read as children. AFO was inspired by the\nvillain in the story, but his bro identified with the story&rsquo;s hero, who never\ngave up in spite of the struggle, until he finally won and saved everyone. AFO\nwas all &ldquo;well that&rsquo;s just a story,&rdquo; which was some great fucking irony right\nthere, and then he bestowed his brother with a quirk, thus unknowingly sealing\nhis own doom. OFA Primo then turned to Deku <i>and\nstarted talking to him</i>, telling him there was more he wanted to show him\nbut that this was all he could manage right now.\nBut he told Deku &ldquo;you are not alone.&rdquo; And then Deku woke himself up by\nactivating some sort of new power in his hand, inadvertently destroying half of\nhis fucking room in the process.</p>\n<p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> Deku tells All Might about the dream and about how OFA Primo spoke to him. All Might says he&rsquo;s seen the&nbsp;&ldquo;Vestiges&rdquo; of One for All in the past, but that they&rsquo;d never communicated with him. Shimura had told him about that phenomenon though. Apparently the wills of the past OFA wielders are contained within the quirk as part of its power. But All Might has no clue regarding the explosion that took place when Deku woke up, and he tells Deku that for now, they&rsquo;ll search for the answers together. As Deku heads off to his afternoon training session, he runs into Aizawa and Shinsou in the hall. We then cut to the industrial training ground area, where class 1-A shows off their various cold weather gear, including Katsuki, who&rsquo;s got almost a whole new look going on and I love it and never want him to go back tbh. Class 1-B then joins them, and we learn that today&rsquo;s class will be a joint training exercise. Oh, and there&rsquo;s going to be a special guest &ndash; Shinsou, who is still trying to transfer into the hero department. And he&rsquo;s also sporting a familiar-looking capture scarf around his neck.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>(As always, all comments not marked with an ETA are my mostly-unspoiled reactions from my first readthrough of this chapter. I&rsquo;ve read up through chapter 213 now, so any ETAs will reflect that.)</p>\n</p>",
