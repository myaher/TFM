He didn&rsquo;t have the patience to make it last, he was already long gone. He had been sat in a bar, alone, for at least three hours now. </p><p>You and Stephen had had a nasty breakup. A lot of things were said that neither of you meant, yet you both took it to heart anyway, and decided to call it quits on your three year relationship with each other. You didn&rsquo;t want that really, but in the heat of the moment the idea of a breakup was thrown, and you both agreed to it.</p><p>He placed the glass back onto the bar, pointing at the man behind the bar, &ldquo;Kind sir, may I have another?&rdquo; His words were slurred, and he had no real sense of what he was saying.</p><p>The barman shook his head, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not, I can&rsquo;t let you have anymore when you&rsquo;re already too drunk. I&rsquo;m gonna lock up soon, is there anyone you can call who&rsquo;d be able to come and pick you up?&rdquo;</p><p>He thought for a few seconds, then nodded, fumbling in his pocket for his mobile phone. He pulled it out of his pocket, unlocking it. He scrolled through his contacts, the names all becoming one big blur, but not yours. He stopped when he saw your name, and stared at the contact for a few seconds, before deciding that he had to call you. He knew he was too drunk to be speaking to you, and that he would probably screw up again in the state he was in, but he didn&rsquo;t care. He had to speak to you.</p><p>He pressed your contact and started calling you, pressing the phone up to his ear, he held his breath, waiting for you to answer. He&rsquo;d never felt more nervous in his entire life.</p><p>You were sat at home, watching tv, with a tub of ice cream in your hands. You were doing alright, certainly better than Stephen, spending time with friends and family, distracting yourself. But when you were alone, you often thought about him, and what you lost. </p><p>You hadn&rsquo;t heard a word from Stephen, so when your phone rang, and you immediately recognised the number as his, you were more than confused. </p><p>You stared down at your phone, hesitant to answer it, but eventually you did. &ldquo;Um, hello?&rdquo;</p><p>You heard a sigh of relief from the other end of the phone, &ldquo;Y/N? It&rsquo;s you&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d&hellip;pick up. Thankyou&hellip;for doing that.&rdquo; His words were slurred, which hinted to you that he was most likely very drunk. You&rsquo;d never seen him drunk to the point of slurring his words.</p><p>You bit your lip, &ldquo;Stephen what&rsquo;s wrong? Why are you calling?&rdquo;</p><p>He gave a chuckle, &ldquo;The man behind the bar,&rdquo; he pointed at the man, as if you could see him, &ldquo;is claiming that I&hellip;am drunk.&rdquo;</p><p>You rolled your eyes, &ldquo;You are drunk Stephen. Even I can tell.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The man, this man,&rdquo; he pointed again and the barman just shook his head, smirking, &ldquo;says I need to leave, but claims that I can&rsquo;t drive by myself. He&rsquo;s a great friend, you know.&rdquo;</p><p>You sighed, &ldquo;So, what you&rsquo;re saying is you&rsquo;re really drunk, the bar is about to close and you need me to come and pick you up?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, i mean you don&rsquo;t have-&rdquo;</p><p>You bit your lip, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there in 10.&rdquo;</p><p>You knew exactly which bar he had gone to, it was only a few blocks from your apartment, but across the city from the Sanctum, you weren&rsquo;t exactly sure how he&rsquo;d ended up there. </p><p>You grabbed your jacket and pulled your boots on, walking out of your apartment, locking the door behind you. You ran down the stairs, then out to your car. It was raining, and you were soaked from being in the rain for just two seconds. You opened your car door, got in and started the engine, heading in the direction of the bar your ex boyfriend currently sat in. </p><p>The bar was a short drive, and when you saw the flashing lights that held the bars name, you pulled up. You took out your phone, fixing your hair a little, then pulled on your jacket and got out of the car. You weren&rsquo;t sure whether you&rsquo;d be able to face Stephen, but you figured you had to now that you were already here. </p><p>You pushed the door of the bar open, and your eyes immediately landed on him. You sighed, walking over to him, &ldquo;Stephen?&rdquo;</p><p>His head shot up, and looked up at you, his eyes glazed and blood-shot. &ldquo;Y/N&hellip;. you came.&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded, &ldquo;Yeah I did. Come on, get your jacket. We&rsquo;re leaving.&rdquo;</p><p>He chuckled, &ldquo;Where&hellip;where are we going? The night is still young. We should&hellip;we should go for dinner.&rdquo;</p><p>You shook your head, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost midnight. We&rsquo;re not going for dinner. Come on.&rdquo; You pulled him up from his seat on the bar, wrapping an arm around his waist and pulling him outside. You opened your car door and put him in the passenger seat, leaning down, &ldquo;Stay here. Don&rsquo;t move, don&rsquo;t touch anything. I&rsquo;ll be back in a minute.&rdquo;</p><p>He pouted, &ldquo;Where are you-&rdquo; his speech was interrupted by you shutting the car door. </p><p>You walked back into the bar, picking up his black jacket and phone from one of the seats, then turned to the barman. &ldquo;Thankyou for looking after him and not kicking him out onto the street. I appreciate it.&rdquo;</p><p>The man nodded, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no problem, he wasn&rsquo;t much trouble.&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled and went into Stephens jacket pocket, pulling out $40. You put it on the bar, &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll understand. I think you deserve it. He&rsquo;s a pain.&rdquo;</p><p>He smiled, &ldquo;Thankyou.&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no problem, have a nice night.&rdquo; You left the bar and got into your car, looking over at Stephen. </p><p>You sighed, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a pain in the ass, Strange.&rdquo;</p><p>He said nothing, just looked over at you and smirked. You looked over at him, shaking your head, then started your engine and drove back to your apartment. The drive back was silent, as you had expected it to be.</p><p>You stopped the car in front of your apartment block and he furrowed his eyebrows, \u201cThis isn\u2019t&hellip;the&hellip;thingy&hellip;\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes, \u201cThe sanctum. No, this is my apartment because I\u2019ve already left the house to pick you up and frankly I\u2019m not driving to the other end of the city to drop you off there. Sorry, Stephen. You have to deal with it.\u201d</p><p>Stephen nodded, opening the car door, but you grabbed his arm before he could get out, \u201cDon\u2019t bother. I\u2019ll get you.\u201d You got out of the car, pulling him up and taking him inside. He wasn\u2019t so drunk that he couldn\u2019t walk, but he stumbled a lot, making taking him inside a lot harder than what it should have been.</p><p>You went into the elevator, pressing the button for the top floor. The doors closed, and you looked over at Stephen. He was staring at you intently, and your cheeks blushed a dark red. </p><p>You took his hand when the elevator doors opened, \u201ccome on.\u201d You unlocked the apartment door, taking him inside. </p><p>You bit your lip, \u201cYou can take my bed. There\u2019s still some of your clothes left in there, take those. Try and get some sleep, I\u2019ll drop you off at the sanctum tomorrow.\u201d </p><p>He bit his lip, leaning against the wall. \u201cWill you&hellip;.will you be joining me?\u201d</p><p>You sighed, \u201cI might.\u201d </p><p>He nodded, and went into your bedroom.</p><p>You bit your lip, part of you wanted to stay away from Stephen, to stay away from the life he lived, to stay away from the danger. But another part of you wanted to get in your bed with him, talk things through and make up. You thought for a few seconds, then made your mind up. </p><p>You were going to talk things through with him, when he sobered up of course. </p><p>You went into your room, taking off your jeans and slipping into bed next to him, you wrapped your arms around him, resting your head on his chest. </p><p>He sighed a little, \u201cY/N&hellip;.\u201d</p><p>You shook your head, \u201cDon\u2019t speak. I don\u2019t need to hear it. We can talk about it another time.\u201d</p><p>*extended ending*</p><p>You pulled up next to the sanctum, unlocking the car door, \u201cGet out, Strange. You\u2019ve got a stone to protect.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, \u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019m going.\u201d He got out of the car, leaning down so he could still see you through the car window.</p><p>You smiled, \u201cDinner tonight?\u201d</p><p>He gave you a grin, \u201cI\u2019m free for lunch.\u201d</p><p>You pressed your lips together, \u201cHmm, I\u2019m not.\u201d You flashed him one last grin, then drove off.</p>",

He didn\u2019t have the patience to make it last, he was already long gone. He had been sat in a bar, alone, for at least three hours now. </p><p>You and Stephen had had a nasty breakup. A lot of things were said that neither of you meant, yet you both took it to heart anyway, and decided to call it quits on your three year relationship with each other. You didn\u2019t want that really, but in the heat of the moment the idea of a breakup was thrown, and you both agreed to it.</p><p>He placed the glass back onto the bar, pointing at the man behind the bar, \u201cKind sir, may I have another?\u201d His words were slurred, and he had no real sense of what he was saying.</p><p>The barman shook his head, \u201cI\u2019m afraid not, I can\u2019t let you have anymore when you\u2019re already too drunk. I\u2019m gonna lock up soon, is there anyone you can call who\u2019d be able to come and pick you up?\u201d</p><p>He thought for a few seconds, then nodded, fumbling in his pocket for his mobile phone. He pulled it out of his pocket, unlocking it. He scrolled through his contacts, the names all becoming one big blur, but not yours. He stopped when he saw your name, and stared at the contact for a few seconds, before deciding that he had to call you. He knew he was too drunk to be speaking to you, and that he would probably screw up again in the state he was in, but he didn\u2019t care. He had to speak to you.</p><p>He pressed your contact and started calling you, pressing the phone up to his ear, he held his breath, waiting for you to answer. He\u2019d never felt more nervous in his entire life.</p><p>You were sat at home, watching tv, with a tub of ice cream in your hands. You were doing alright, certainly better than Stephen, spending time with friends and family, distracting yourself. But when you were alone, you often thought about him, and what you lost. </p><p>You hadn\u2019t heard a word from Stephen, so when your phone rang, and you immediately recognised the number as his, you were more than confused. </p><p>You stared down at your phone, hesitant to answer it, but eventually you did. \u201cUm, hello?\u201d</p><p>You heard a sigh of relief from the other end of the phone, \u201cY/N? It\u2019s you\u2026I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d\u2026pick up. Thankyou\u2026for doing that.\u201d His words were slurred, which hinted to you that he was most likely very drunk. You\u2019d never seen him drunk to the point of slurring his words.</p><p>You bit your lip, \u201cStephen what\u2019s wrong? Why are you calling?\u201d</p><p>He gave a chuckle, \u201cThe man behind the bar,\u201d he pointed at the man, as if you could see him, \u201cis claiming that I\u2026am drunk.\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes, \u201cYou are drunk Stephen. Even I can tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man, this man,\u201d he pointed again and the barman just shook his head, smirking, \u201csays I need to leave, but claims that I can\u2019t drive by myself. He\u2019s a great friend, you know.\u201d</p><p>You sighed, \u201cSo, what you\u2019re saying is you\u2019re really drunk, the bar is about to close and you need me to come and pick you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, i mean you don\u2019t have-\u201d</p><p>You bit your lip, \u201cI\u2019ll be there in 10.\u201d</p><p>You knew exactly which bar he had gone to, it was only a few blocks from your apartment, but across the city from the Sanctum, you weren\u2019t exactly sure how he\u2019d ended up there. </p><p>You grabbed your jacket and pulled your boots on, walking out of your apartment, locking the door behind you. You ran down the stairs, then out to your car. It was raining, and you were soaked from being in the rain for just two seconds. You opened your car door, got in and started the engine, heading in the direction of the bar your ex boyfriend currently sat in. </p><p>The bar was a short drive, and when you saw the flashing lights that held the bars name, you pulled up. You took out your phone, fixing your hair a little, then pulled on your jacket and got out of the car. You weren\u2019t sure whether you\u2019d be able to face Stephen, but you figured you had to now that you were already here. </p><p>You pushed the door of the bar open, and your eyes immediately landed on him. You sighed, walking over to him, \u201cStephen?\u201d</p><p>His head shot up, and looked up at you, his eyes glazed and blood-shot. \u201cY/N\u2026. you came.\u201d</p><p>You nodded, \u201cYeah I did. Come on, get your jacket. We\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, \u201cWhere\u2026where are we going? The night is still young. We should\u2026we should go for dinner.\u201d</p><p>You shook your head, \u201cIt\u2019s almost midnight. We\u2019re not going for dinner. Come on.\u201d You pulled him up from his seat on the bar, wrapping an arm around his waist and pulling him outside. You opened your car door and put him in the passenger seat, leaning down, \u201cStay here. Don\u2019t move, don\u2019t touch anything. I\u2019ll be back in a minute.\u201d</p><p>He pouted, \u201cWhere are you-\u201d his speech was interrupted by you shutting the car door. </p><p>You walked back into the bar, picking up his black jacket and phone from one of the seats, then turned to the barman. \u201cThankyou for looking after him and not kicking him out onto the street. I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>The man nodded, \u201cIt\u2019s no problem, he wasn\u2019t much trouble.\u201d</p><p>You smiled and went into Stephens jacket pocket, pulling out $40. You put it on the bar, \u201cHe\u2019ll understand. I think you deserve it. He\u2019s a pain.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, \u201cThankyou.\u201d</p><p>You nodded, \u201cIt\u2019s no problem, have a nice night.\u201d You left the bar and got into your car, looking over at Stephen. </p><p>You sighed, \u201cyou\u2019re a pain in the ass, Strange.\u201d</p><p>He said nothing, just looked over at you and smirked. You looked over at him, shaking your head, then started your engine and drove back to your apartment. The drive back was silent, as you had expected it to be.</p><p>You stopped the car in front of your apartment block and he furrowed his eyebrows, \u201cThis isn\u2019t\u2026the\u2026thingy\u2026\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes, \u201cThe sanctum. No, this is my apartment because I\u2019ve already left the house to pick you up and frankly I\u2019m not driving to the other end of the city to drop you off there. Sorry, Stephen. You have to deal with it.\u201d</p><p>Stephen nodded, opening the car door, but you grabbed his arm before he could get out, \u201cDon\u2019t bother. I\u2019ll get you.\u201d You got out of the car, pulling him up and taking him inside. He wasn\u2019t so drunk that he couldn\u2019t walk, but he stumbled a lot, making taking him inside a lot harder than what it should have been.</p><p>You went into the elevator, pressing the button for the top floor. The doors closed, and you looked over at Stephen. He was staring at you intently, and your cheeks blushed a dark red. </p><p>You took his hand when the elevator doors opened, \u201ccome on.\u201d You unlocked the apartment door, taking him inside. </p><p>You bit your lip, \u201cYou can take my bed. There\u2019s still some of your clothes left in there, take those. Try and get some sleep, I\u2019ll drop you off at the sanctum tomorrow.\u201d </p><p>He bit his lip, leaning against the wall. \u201cWill you\u2026.will you be joining me?\u201d</p><p>You sighed, \u201cI might.\u201d </p><p>He nodded, and went into your bedroom.</p><p>You bit your lip, part of you wanted to stay away from Stephen, to stay away from the life he lived, to stay away from the danger. But another part of you wanted to get in your bed with him, talk things through and make up. You thought for a few seconds, then made your mind up. </p><p>You were going to talk things through with him, when he sobered up of course. </p><p>You went into your room, taking off your jeans and slipping into bed next to him, you wrapped your arms around him, resting your head on his chest. </p><p>He sighed a little, \u201cY/N\u2026.\u201d</p><p>You shook your head, \u201cDon\u2019t speak. I don\u2019t need to hear it. We can talk about it another time.\u201d</p><p>*extended ending*</p><p>You pulled up next to the sanctum, unlocking the car door, \u201cGet out, Strange. You\u2019ve got a stone to protect.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, \u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019m going.\u201d He got out of the car, leaning down so he could still see you through the car window.</p><p>You smiled, \u201cDinner tonight?\u201d</p><p>He gave you a grin, \u201cI\u2019m free for lunch.\u201d</p><p>You pressed your lips together, \u201cHmm, I\u2019m not.\u201d You flashed him one last grin, then drove off.</p></p>",

Natasha just laughing along.</i></p><p><i>This was your life.\u00a0</i></p><p>You silently smiled to yourself as you walked towards your apartment. The crowd of people started to become smaller and smaller the further you walked away from the city. Although taking a cab or a train would\u2019ve been easier, you normally walked home.\u00a0</p><p>The quiet and dark skies usually entertained you. The wind breezing through the trees, you lived near a beautiful forest and grew fond of the silence.\u00a0</p><p>You were used to the silence and being alone. Hell if you\u2019ve kept it up for three years, you could do it longer.\u00a0</p><p>Every night was the same except for this one.\u00a0</p><p>Something strange, odd, that bothered you. The walk home was usually peaceful but tonight it felt like you were on a mission cautious of the things around you.\u00a0</p><p>As a trained agent, you weren\u2019t scared of what was out there, lurking in the dark but of who. No one knows of your location and you made sure of that. You chose to live in a quiet town, somewhere off the radar where no one would question your existence.\u00a0</p><p>You kept your head straight and kept on walking, suddenly feeling a touch on your shoulder. You quickly snatched the hand away and began attacking when your hand was held before initiating contact.\u00a0\u201c<i>Steve.\u201d </i>You whispered.\u00a0</p><p><b><i><br/></i></b></p><hr><p><b><i><br/></i></b></p><p><b><i><br/></i></b></p><p><b><i>well&hellip;. help??
