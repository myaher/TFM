It had been a long eleven and a half months, but\nthe city finally felt like home and moving felt like the right thing to do.\nSure, she\u2019d miss having Harry around, but she\u2019d have her own space now and she\nknew that he would come over almost everyday before One Direction left for\ntheir world tour in April. With her bags packed and ready to go she loaded them\ninto the back of Harry\u2019s land rover and waited for him to be ready to take her\nto the new flat.</p><p>\u201cReady to leave me?\u201d\nhe said dramatically as he closed the front door behind him. </p><p>\u201cThink of it this way\nH,\u201d Poppy said with a smirk forming on her face \u201cnow you and Kendall can fuck\nin every room of the house\u201d </p><p>Harry had only been\nback in London for a few days since going to LA to spend some time with his\namerican friends. Most of that time, however, had been spent with one Miss\nKendall Jenner and he was completely infatuated with her. To the point where\nhe\u2019d invited her to London to celebrate his (late) birthday with his family.\nBut that was also Poppy\u2019s birthday and she didn\u2019t know how she felt about\nKendall being there. </p><p>\u201cNope\u201d he shook his\nhead \u201cYour room is sacred\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my room\nanymore\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt will always be\nyours Pop\u201d he opened the drivers side door and go into the car. Poppy did the\nsame and sat herself down in the passenger&rsquo;s seat. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss having my\nown free chauffeur\u201d she giggled </p><p>\u201cThe new flat\u2019s only\na block away, walk here and I\u2019ll drive you wherever you need to go\u201d he knocked\nthe car into reverse and backed out of the driveway onto the empty street. </p><p>\u201cKendall wouldn\u2019t\nlike that\u201d Harry could hear the bitterness in Poppy\u2019s voice everytime she said\nKendalls name and he couldn\u2019t work out why. She was the first real girlfriend\nthat he\u2019s had since he\u2019d known Poppy and he thought that she&rsquo;d be happy for\nhim. </p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t hate you\nPop\u201d he said, thinking that maybe Poppy\u2019s bitterness had something to do with\nthe fact that Kendall had never said a nice word to Poppy</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t like me\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t not like\nyou\u201d he said, looking at her for only a moment as they stopped at the traffic\nlights. </p><p>Poppy didn\u2019t respond,\nshe didn\u2019t know what to say, or how she should act when kendall was around or\neven what she should say to Kendall and that\u2019s why part of her was glad to be\nmoving out. </p><p>The new flat really\nwas only a block away so Poppy\u2019s silence went unnoticed as they pulled up to\nthe loading zone at the back of the building. Her things were few and far\nbetween and it didn\u2019t take long before they got it all into the new flat. But\nthe move wasn\u2019t finished yet, her furniture was to be delivered by 10am and\nthen they would be spending the rest of the day putting it all together.

They talked more now, and if Harry wasn\u2019t\nover at the flat, they were texting about anything and everything. Which\n\u00a0is exactly what was happening right now as poppy got herself ready to go\nto dinner to finally celebrate their birthdays. </p><p><i>What\u2019s the attire for\nthis occasion H?

The bitter wind\nstruck her face and in the dark she felt like she was the runaway bride from a\nvictorian romance novel, seeking shelter at the local Inn. </p><p>\u201cHi\u201d she said to the\nbartender \u201cCould I get five pints and a tequila on the rocks please\u201d </p><p>\u201cComing right up\u201d he\npoured the drinks and set them out on a tray that Poppy could carry to a free\ntable, of which there were none . \u201cDo you have a booking love?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUhh yeah\u201d Poppy\nnodded \u201cProbably under the name Greenberg\u201d That was the name that Harry used\nwhen he didn\u2019t want to be found out and he never wanted to be found out. </p><p>He looked through the\ndiary that sat next to the till and frowned when he couldn\u2019t find the name,\n\u201cwould it be under another name?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMaybe Thomas\u201d </p><p>\u201cNope\u201d the bartender\nshook his head </p><p>\u201cTwist?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBingo\u201d he laughed\n\u201cwe\u2019ve got you on table 6 over in the corner, I\u2019ll carry these over for you\u201d </p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d Poppy\nsmiled and followed him to the table. It really was in the corner, and Poppy\nwondered if Harry had asked for that. This wasn\u2019t exactly a quiet place, it was\nfull and many of the people here were young, people that would know who he is.\nPoppy sat down and took a sip of her beer, taking in the space and a wave of\nsadness washed over her. It didn\u2019t feel like her birthday, for starters it was\ncold and nothing about February in Australia was cold. But before she had too\nmuch time to dwell on her sadness, the rest of the party arrived, with smiles\nspread across their faces. </p><p>\u201cJesus Pop\u201d Gemma\nsaid looking at the drink \u201cHope you plan on sharing those\u201d </p><p>Poppy laughed shyly\n\u201cThey\u2019re for everyone, and the tequila is for mr fussy over there\u201d </p><p>\u201cMr Fussy is very\nthankful for his tequila\u201d Harry smiled and kissed Poppy on the forehead \u201cHappy\nLate Birthday Pop\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou too H\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only two weeks\noff\u201d Anne said </p><p>\u201cBecause someone\u201d\nPoppy emphasised, looking towards Harry \u201chad to go to LA\u201d </p><p>\u201cWith his girlfriend\u201d\nGemma added in a childish tone </p><p>\u201cAlright alright,\nnone o\u2019 that\u201d Harry raised his hands in surrender. The sadness that had visited\nPoppy only moments ago had suddenly disappeared when she realised that it\ndidn&rsquo;t have to feel like her birthday, being an adult meant that most years it\nprobably wouldn\u2019t feel like it, but she was surrounded by people she loved, who\nloved her back, and that was enough.</p><p>They scanned the\nmenus and ordered their meals in between fits of laughter at one another. Lux\nand Harry stole the show after she insisted that she sat on his lap so that she\ncould tell him all about her new doll. \u00a0Their meals came and they were as\ndelicious as Poppy had hoped and at the end of it all Anne stood up and left\nthe table, bringing a cake back with her. But Harry\u2019s phone rang before the\ncake even made it onto the table, it was Kendall and he picked up immediately. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he said\nsoftly into the phone \u201cI can\u2019t right now, I\u2019m at dinner \u2026 my mum and Sister and\nPoppy\u2026.no she\u2019s not\u2026 we\u2019re just friends&hellip;it\u2019s her birthday too\u2026 I have to go,\nI\u2019ll talk to you later\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre you done?\u201d Gemma\nsaid sternly with raised eyebrows </p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Harry\ncleared his throat \u201cCake!\u201d </p><p>Anne shook her head\nat Harry and Poppy began to wonder if her and Gemma knew something she didn\u2019t. </p><p>\u201cRight you two\u201d Anne\npointed towards the two of them and moved the cake over so that it sat between\nthem \u201cSmile and then we\u2019ll sing.\u201d </p><p>Poppy leant over and\nkissed Harry on the cheek while he smiled at the camera. Poppy\u2019s hand cupped\nhis face and they burst into fits of laughter that almost blew the candles out.\n</p><p>\u201cHappy Birthday to\nyou\u2026\u201d Gemma began to sing to avoid a commotion </p><p>\u201cHappy Birthday to\nyou\u201d everyone else joined in </p><p><i>\u201cHappy Birthday dear\nHarry and Poppy</i></p><p><i>Happy Birthday to\nyou\u201d </i></p><p>\u201cMake a wish Pop\u201d\nHarry whispered before they blew the candles out together. </p><p>Harry cut the cake,\nand the the request of Lux, he and Poppy jokingly shared a kiss on the lips.\nBut the timing couldn\u2019t have been worse, because in the same second that their\nlips met, Kendall stumbled into the pub, locking her eyes onto their table immediately.\nHarry hadn\u2019t seen her walk in, but he certainly heard her once she started\nshouting. </p><p>\u201cGet off him!\u201d </p><p>Poppy jumped, not\nexpecting such a scene \u201cIt\u2019s all in good fun\u201d she said, trying to calm her down\n\u201cthe knife came out dirty so he had to kiss the closest girl, that\u2019s the rules,\nright Lux?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYep\u201d Lux said shyly\nas she hid her head in Harry\u2019s shoulder. </p><p>\u201cThat sounds like an\nexcuse, you\u2019re in love with him and it\u2019s so obvious\u201d </p><p>An uncomfortable\nsilence fell over the table, like everyone drew in a breath at the same time\nand forgot to let it go. </p><p>\u201cI think you should\ngo now Kendall\u201d Harry said harshly, like he wasn\u2019t taking no for an answer. </p><p>Kendall pursed her\nlips, and turned around on her back foot, then she walked away. </p><p>The silence stuck,\nfor a moment, until Poppy broke it \u201cI\u2019m not in love with you H\u201d </p><p>He nodded and handed\nher a slice of the cake. \u201cHappy Birthday Poppy\u201d </p>",

It had been a long eleven and a half months, but\nthe city finally felt like home and moving felt like the right thing to do.\nSure, she\u2019d miss having Harry around, but she\u2019d have her own space now and she\nknew that he would come over almost everyday before One Direction left for\ntheir world tour in April. With her bags packed and ready to go she loaded them\ninto the back of Harry\u2019s land rover and waited for him to be ready to take her\nto the new flat.</p><p>\u201cReady to leave me?\u201d\nhe said dramatically as he closed the front door behind him. </p><p>\u201cThink of it this way\nH,\u201d Poppy said with a smirk forming on her face \u201cnow you and Kendall can fuck\nin every room of the house\u201d </p><p>Harry had only been\nback in London for a few days since going to LA to spend some time with his\namerican friends. Most of that time, however, had been spent with one Miss\nKendall Jenner and he was completely infatuated with her. To the point where\nhe\u2019d invited her to London to celebrate his (late) birthday with his family.\nBut that was also Poppy\u2019s birthday and she didn\u2019t know how she felt about\nKendall being there. </p><p>\u201cNope\u201d he shook his\nhead \u201cYour room is sacred\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my room\nanymore\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt will always be\nyours Pop\u201d he opened the drivers side door and go into the car. Poppy did the\nsame and sat herself down in the passenger\u2019s seat. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss having my\nown free chauffeur\u201d she giggled </p><p>\u201cThe new flat\u2019s only\na block away, walk here and I\u2019ll drive you wherever you need to go\u201d he knocked\nthe car into reverse and backed out of the driveway onto the empty street. </p><p>\u201cKendall wouldn\u2019t\nlike that\u201d Harry could hear the bitterness in Poppy\u2019s voice everytime she said\nKendalls name and he couldn\u2019t work out why. She was the first real girlfriend\nthat he\u2019s had since he\u2019d known Poppy and he thought that she\u2019d be happy for\nhim. </p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t hate you\nPop\u201d he said, thinking that maybe Poppy\u2019s bitterness had something to do with\nthe fact that Kendall had never said a nice word to Poppy</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t like me\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t not like\nyou\u201d he said, looking at her for only a moment as they stopped at the traffic\nlights. </p><p>Poppy didn\u2019t respond,\nshe didn\u2019t know what to say, or how she should act when kendall was around or\neven what she should say to Kendall and that\u2019s why part of her was glad to be\nmoving out. </p><p>The new flat really\nwas only a block away so Poppy\u2019s silence went unnoticed as they pulled up to\nthe loading zone at the back of the building. Her things were few and far\nbetween and it didn\u2019t take long before they got it all into the new flat. But\nthe move wasn\u2019t finished yet, her furniture was to be delivered by 10am and\nthen they would be spending the rest of the day putting it all together. But\nuntil then, they sat in the middle of the floor in what would soon be Poppy\u2019s\nliving room with the coffee\u2019s that Harry got them from the cafe just next door.\n</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll be\nspending a lot of time here, hiding away from the world\u201d Harry sighed looking\naround the room </p><p>\u201cOnly if you bring me\nchocolate when you come over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring you all\nof the chocolate in the world\u201d </p><p>Poppy\u2019s eyes lit up\n\u201cWill you actually? Like will you bring me chocolate from all the countries you\ngo to on tour\u201d</p><p>Harry nodded slowly\n\u201cI could do that. Or\u201d he paused for a moment \u201cyou could come on tour with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather\ntake kendall?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo\u201d he said bluntly\n\u201cI\u2019d rather take you\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I ask something,\nwithout you getting offended?\u201d Poppy said, taking Harry\u2019s cup from him </p><p>\u201cYou can ask\u201d he said\n\u201cI make no promises though\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat is it about\nher?\u201d </p><p>He shrugged and shook\nhis head \u201cI don\u2019t know Pop, but I really like her\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know, sometimes I\nforget that you\u2019re Harry Styles the pop star, and Harry my best friend, because\nHarry my best friend probably wouldn\u2019t want to be with someone like her, but\nHarry Styles the pop star probably would\u201d </p><p>\u201cHarry Styles the Pop\nStar and Harry your best friend are the same person Poppy, give her a chance,\nyou might really like her\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try\u201d Poppy\nleant her head on Harry\u2019s shoulder \u201conly because I love you\u201d </p><p>Harry kissed the top\nof her head \u201cLove you too Pop\u201d </p>[[MORE]]<p>***</p><p>February 18th 2014 </p><p> After a week in her new flat Poppy felt more\nat home in London than ever, she had her own space and her own time to do what\nshe needed to do for Uni and life in general and in a weird way, she felt even\ncloser to Harry since moving out. They talked more now, and if Harry wasn\u2019t\nover at the flat, they were texting about anything and everything. Which\n\u00a0is exactly what was happening right now as poppy got herself ready to go\nto dinner to finally celebrate their birthdays. </p><p><i>What\u2019s the attire for\nthis occasion H?

It had been a long eleven and a half months, but\nthe city finally felt like home and moving felt like the right thing to do.\nSure, she&rsquo;d miss having Harry around, but she&rsquo;d have her own space now and she\nknew that he would come over almost everyday before One Direction left for\ntheir world tour in April. With her bags packed and ready to go she loaded them\ninto the back of Harry&rsquo;s land rover and waited for him to be ready to take her\nto the new flat.</p><p>&ldquo;Ready to leave me?&rdquo;\nhe said dramatically as he closed the front door behind him. </p><p>&ldquo;Think of it this way\nH,&rdquo; Poppy said with a smirk forming on her face &ldquo;now you and Kendall can fuck\nin every room of the house&rdquo; </p><p>Harry had only been\nback in London for a few days since going to LA to spend some time with his\namerican friends. Most of that time, however, had been spent with one Miss\nKendall Jenner and he was completely infatuated with her. To the point where\nhe&rsquo;d invited her to London to celebrate his (late) birthday with his family.\nBut that was also Poppy&rsquo;s birthday and she didn&rsquo;t know how she felt about\nKendall being there. </p><p>&ldquo;Nope&rdquo; he shook his\nhead &ldquo;Your room is sacred&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my room\nanymore&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It will always be\nyours Pop&rdquo; he opened the drivers side door and go into the car.

She was the first real girlfriend\nthat he&rsquo;s had since he&rsquo;d known Poppy and he thought that she&rsquo;d be happy for\nhim. </p><p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t hate you\nPop&rdquo; he said, thinking that maybe Poppy&rsquo;s bitterness had something to do with\nthe fact that Kendall had never said a nice word to Poppy</p><p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t like me&rdquo;\n</p><p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t not like\nyou&rdquo; he said, looking at her for only a moment as they stopped at the traffic\nlights. </p><p>Poppy didn&rsquo;t respond,\nshe didn&rsquo;t know what to say, or how she should act when kendall was around or\neven what she should say to Kendall and that&rsquo;s why part of her was glad to be\nmoving out. </p><p>The new flat really\nwas only a block away so Poppy&rsquo;s silence went unnoticed as they pulled up to\nthe loading zone at the back of the building. Her things were few and far\nbetween and it didn&rsquo;t take long before they got it all into the new flat. But\nthe move wasn&rsquo;t finished yet, her furniture was to be delivered by 10am and\nthen they would be spending the rest of the day putting it all together. But\nuntil then, they sat in the middle of the floor in what would soon be Poppy&rsquo;s\nliving room with the coffee&rsquo;s that Harry got them from the cafe just next door.\n</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll be\nspending a lot of time here, hiding away from the world&rdquo; Harry sighed looking\naround the room </p><p>&ldquo;Only if you bring me\nchocolate when you come over?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring you all\nof the chocolate in the world&rdquo; </p><p>Poppy&rsquo;s eyes lit up\n&ldquo;Will you actually?

They talked more now, and if Harry wasn&rsquo;t\nover at the flat, they were texting about anything and everything. Which\n&nbsp;is exactly what was happening right now as poppy got herself ready to go\nto dinner to finally celebrate their birthdays. </p><p><i>What&rsquo;s the attire for\nthis occasion H? I&rsquo;m not used to dressing for my birthday in Winter </i></p><p><b><i>Did you go to Pubs\nback home? </i></b></p><p><i>On the odd occasion,\nsure </i></p><p><b><i>Well wear what you\nwould wear to the pub in winter </i></b></p><p><b><i>But with a few extra\nlayers because you don&rsquo;t know what cold is over there</i></b> </p><p><i>Gotcha </i></p><p><i>What&rsquo;s Kendall\nwearing?</i></p><p><b><i>She&rsquo;s not coming\nanymore, there&rsquo;s a fashion show she&rsquo;d rather go to </i></b></p><p><i>Yeah, that sounds\nmore important </i></p><p><b><i>She was with me for\nmy real birthday </i></b></p><p><i>I guess </i></p><p><b><i>Do you want me to\npick you up? </i></b></p><p><i>I think I&rsquo;ll walk, I&rsquo;m\nstill trying to get to know the area</i> &nbsp;</p><p><b><i>It&rsquo;s just about\nsnowing out there, you sure?</i></b></p><p><i>I&rsquo;ve &nbsp;got gloves\nand a coat, might even break out that beanie you got me, but it might ruin my\nhair </i></p><p><b><i>Your hair looks\n&nbsp;great all the time, plus Lou will be there, she&rsquo;ll fix it </i></b></p><p><i>I&rsquo;m leaving now, I&rsquo;ll\nbuy the first round xx </i></p><p>The Spaniards Inn was\ncloser to Harry&rsquo;s than it was to Poppy&rsquo;s but with her coat and gloves on she\nquickly made her way there, only taking the wrong turn once. The bitter wind\nstruck her face and in the dark she felt like she was the runaway bride from a\nvictorian romance novel, seeking shelter at the local Inn. </p><p>&ldquo;Hi&rdquo; she said to the\nbartender &ldquo;Could I get five pints and a tequila on the rocks please&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Coming right up&rdquo; he\npoured the drinks and set them out on a tray that Poppy could carry to a free\ntable, of which there were none . &ldquo;Do you have a booking love?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Uhh yeah&rdquo; Poppy\nnodded &ldquo;Probably under the name Greenberg&rdquo; That was the name that Harry used\nwhen he didn&rsquo;t want to be found out and he never wanted to be found out. </p><p>He looked through the\ndiary that sat next to the till and frowned when he couldn&rsquo;t find the name,\n&ldquo;would it be under another name?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe Thomas&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Nope&rdquo; the bartender\nshook his head </p><p>&ldquo;Twist?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Bingo&rdquo; he laughed\n&ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got you on table 6 over in the corner, I&rsquo;ll carry these over for you&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; Poppy\nsmiled and followed him to the table. It really was in the corner, and Poppy\nwondered if Harry had asked for that. This wasn&rsquo;t exactly a quiet place, it was\nfull and many of the people here were young, people that would know who he is.\nPoppy sat down and took a sip of her beer, taking in the space and a wave of\nsadness washed over her. It didn&rsquo;t feel like her birthday, for starters it was\ncold and nothing about February in Australia was cold. But before she had too\nmuch time to dwell on her sadness, the rest of the party arrived, with smiles\nspread across their faces. </p><p>&ldquo;Jesus Pop&rdquo; Gemma\nsaid looking at the drink &ldquo;Hope you plan on sharing those&rdquo; </p><p>Poppy laughed shyly\n&ldquo;They&rsquo;re for everyone, and the tequila is for mr fussy over there&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Mr Fussy is very\nthankful for his tequila&rdquo; Harry smiled and kissed Poppy on the forehead &ldquo;Happy\nLate Birthday Pop&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You too H&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only two weeks\noff&rdquo; Anne said </p><p>&ldquo;Because someone&rdquo;\nPoppy emphasised, looking towards Harry &ldquo;had to go to LA&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;With his girlfriend&rdquo;\nGemma added in a childish tone </p><p>&ldquo;Alright alright,\nnone o&rsquo; that&rdquo; Harry raised his hands in surrender. The sadness that had visited\nPoppy only moments ago had suddenly disappeared when she realised that it\ndidn&rsquo;t have to feel like her birthday, being an adult meant that most years it\nprobably wouldn&rsquo;t feel like it, but she was surrounded by people she loved, who\nloved her back, and that was enough.</p><p>They scanned the\nmenus and ordered their meals in between fits of laughter at one another. Lux\nand Harry stole the show after she insisted that she sat on his lap so that she\ncould tell him all about her new doll. &nbsp;Their meals came and they were as\ndelicious as Poppy had hoped and at the end of it all Anne stood up and left\nthe table, bringing a cake back with her. But Harry&rsquo;s phone rang before the\ncake even made it onto the table, it was Kendall and he picked up immediately. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; he said\nsoftly into the phone &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t right now, I&rsquo;m at dinner &hellip; my mum and Sister and\nPoppy&hellip;.no she&rsquo;s not&hellip; we&rsquo;re just friends&hellip;it&rsquo;s her birthday too&hellip; I have to go,\nI&rsquo;ll talk to you later&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Are you done?&rdquo; Gemma\nsaid sternly with raised eyebrows </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Harry\ncleared his throat &ldquo;Cake!&rdquo; </p><p>Anne shook her head\nat Harry and Poppy began to wonder if her and Gemma knew something she didn&rsquo;t. </p><p>&ldquo;Right you two&rdquo; Anne\npointed towards the two of them and moved the cake over so that it sat between\nthem &ldquo;Smile and then we&rsquo;ll sing.&rdquo; </p><p>Poppy leant over and\nkissed Harry on the cheek while he smiled at the camera.
