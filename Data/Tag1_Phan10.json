You know him inside and out and upside-down and backwards, with your hands and your eyes, lips and tongue and heart. You know every one of his smiles and the lines etched into his face and the freckles dotted like stars across his skin.</p><p>He lays himself bare for the whole world to see but when he\u2019s pressed against your skin he whispers <i>it\u2019s always been you</i> like a sacred promise.</p><p>(And you believe him, you\u2019ve always believed him.)</p><p>-</p><p>Today, here is what you know:</p><p>You know that red is for the life you built together, years and years all piling on top of one another until you began measuring time in decades instead of minutes. Red is his pulse thrumming under his skin where his body touches yours, where you forget your own ending in his beginning. The spines of the photobooks are soft and stretched and marked red with loving hands, marked with stories told tandem in two voices. \u00a0Red is the beating of your own heart in your chest, <i>thump-thump, thump-thump,</i> steady and slow under the press of his palm while you sleep.</p><p>You know that he is alive, and he is yours.</p><p>-</p><p>You know that orange is for all the shattered parts, for the way you held out tape and glue and string for him to piece himself back together. Orange is the way you tried to take the sharpest thorns for yourself, would bleed any colour for him if it meant he\u2019d sleep easier at night.</p><p>(But he can\u2019t stand to watch you bleed, either.)</p><p>You were made to be whole together, the universe made you each half a man and then sent you into its depths to find your other part. He pushed while you pulled, the sea against the moon, and the whole world marveled at the way he created radiance out of blackness.</p><p>You know that he is healing, and he is yours.</p><p>-</p><p>Oh god, how you know him in every possible shade of yellow! You know him drenched in golden summer sun, you\u2019ve lost yourself tracing constellations into his skin while his laughter fills every hollow of your heart. He tastes like sweat and expensive sun cream, his pulse races fast and strong under your tongue and you - you love him, desperate and unashamed. \u00a0 </p><p>You know him in the pale, daffodil-toned morning, know the curve of his body against yours while he sleeps and the gentle sounds he makes while he wakes. You know the way the sheets, the flat, the whole of your existence is warmed because of him. You\u2019ve forgotten how to not wake up next to him and now there\u2019s nothing else except that you love him, quietly and peacefully.</p><p>You know him in yellow so bright that it\u2019s hard to look at him, but you couldn\u2019t look away even if you wanted to. He\u2019s got flowers in his hair and paint in his cuticles and you have known him through all the days where being yellow was nothing more than a distant illusion. You love him, you love him, you love him. This is what you know.</p><p>-</p><p>You know that green is for your future, for a home and a life that is just within your reach. You know this because you\u2019ve glimpsed it in the dark of night, your dreams show you the lush, thick grass and the leaves in the spring and the life clawing its way up out of the dirt. Life that you poured your own being into, your hands turned the earth while <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/5xXjqFnvQbxZglR1sGm0Yc?si=Q6IIfNSsSoSdogOofeipEQ\" target=\"_blank\">he played Chopin for you through the open window.</a></p><p><i>It\u2019s a sad song,</i> you tell him, leaning on the windowsill and sipping spiked Ribena while the sweat gathers at the nape of your neck.</p><p><i>It\u2019s not,</i> he says,<i> it\u2019s about coming home, </i>and the A-flats follow you into your waking hours.</p><p>Your entire universe spins around him. This is what you know.</p><p>-</p><p>You know that blue is forty-five minutes and twenty-nine seconds long.</p><p>You know the way he clings to you, fully clothed and too-warm under the weight of the duvet, the fan on high to drown out the buzzing in both your heads as well as the incessant notifications locked on the other side of the bedroom door. Blue is the way he cries against your chest, happy and overwhelmed and terrified. Blue is his ragged voice saying <i>you\u2019re crushing me</i> when it\u2019s the forty-fourth minute, almost time to go. You try to loosen your grip but you just can\u2019t, you want to crawl into his skin and protect his baby bird heart along with all the pieces of yourself that he keeps there.</p><p>Blue is the forty-sixth minute, walking hand-in-hand up the stairs on shaky legs to face a new world.</p><p>He stands tall with the bravery of millions, and he is yours.</p><p>-</p><p>Violet is the colour he wears when you marry him. You know this, you\u2019ve got the namesake flower pinned above your heart but the sight of him draped in it still takes your breath away. He is bright and open and wearing the smile that you\u2019ve come to think of as your smile, the one he doesn\u2019t give away to anyone but you. Your hands shake terribly but he steadies them against his own, steadies your entire being with the way he looks at you under the April sun.</p><p>Violet is the colour of the vows you say, the paraphrased and ad-libbed version of the ones you wrote down because you couldn\u2019t bear to let go of him long enough to pull the paper out of your jacket pocket. You remember the important parts though, the four thousand yellow mornings and another twenty thousand or so green ones stretched out in front of you. Two red strings entwined throughout an entire lifetime, stitched and mended with threads of orange in the places where they were thin and torn. The cloak of blue you both wear proudly, you\u2019ve wrapped your entire life in the colour and let it propel you here, to this exact moment.</p><p>This is what you know: it\u2019s right. You love him in every iteration and every timeline and every lifetime, you have a soul painted in streaks of colour and there is no version of you that exists without him.</p><p>It\u2019s right.</p><p>It\u2019s right.</p><p>It\u2019s right.</p><p>__________</p><p><i>the hand, the heart <br/>an end, a start</i></p><p><i>who decides <br/>the rules <br/>for lovers?</i></p><p><i>(you and i) <br/>(we choose each other)</i></p>",

I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m troubled by it or proud in some twisted way, but I know that I overthink, and I know that I do it a lot. All I can think about now a days is you and the night I got accepted. You being in my thoughts is normal, it\u2019s nearly second nature at this point. \u2018Do I like this? No. Will Phil? Probably.\u2019 You were always a thought in my mind, sometimes even before myself. But I haven\u2019t stopped thinking about that night since we parted ways. I stared at you with this huge grin and before I could even say a word my mouth was preoccupied with your own. You pulled me into this huge hug, and we were just so content, but still excited for the future. Thinking back, we never really talked about what was going to happen, though in my mind you were coming to New York with me, but for once I didn\u2019t know what you were thinking. You must have slept on the idea, and realized that moving halfway across the world to stay with me was something you just couldn\u2019t do. You didn\u2019t want leave your family for that long, especially to be in a foreign country. I was hurt, and it still aches now, but I understood. We had done long distance before, how hard could it be? I remember when we first started talking. It was easier back then, the whole long distance thing at least. It was something to keep us going. We knew that we were young, and while the world around is 24,000 miles there were only 300 between us. Then after the daily five hour skype calls and late night twitter conversations we finally met at that Manchester train station. I remember the October air was unbelievably cold, but as soon as you pulled me into that hug I felt like I could\u2019ve melted. And even after the first phil is not on fire and those intimate nights curled up next to you, it still felt like the butterflies fluttering in my stomach could suffocate me with one doe eyed look from you. I don\u2019t know when that feeling stopped. I wish it hadn\u2019t. </p><p><i>Phil </i></p><p>I don\u2019t remember losing feelings for you. I\u2019m not sure I ever did. If you were to look me over with your chestnut brown eyes right now, I think I\u2019d feel same fluttering feeling as I did all those years ago, maybe even stronger now. I remember the night where we were sat on the roof of our old flat watching as the snow fell in clumps onto the dirty cement. It was late, so late that you couldn\u2019t tell whether the sallow hues in the sky were from the bleached moonlight or the pale sun. You had been fast asleep only minutes before, but I was wide awake, and the snow was coming down heavy. You always complained about the frigid air and how dirty snow in the city looked, but I knew how much you loved it, and I knew how much you would love seeing it before it was dirtied by the cars on the road and the ash in the sky. I remember dragging the heels of my boots through the already thick blanket as you watched me from your sitting place on an exposed pipe. I never truly saw you looking at me, but I could tell you were. Maybe we really could read each other\u2019s minds, because even while you hid your face behind your scarf, I could tell you were taking in everything with those soft eyes and grinning at the clicheness of it all. The butterflies in my stomach were almost tickling my throat from the way you were looking at me, and it was in those moments I realized that even though we were in our third flat together, and nearing eight years of knowing each other, I would never find someone like you ever again.</p><p><i>Dan</i></p><p>I don\u2019t like using the word \u201cboring\u201d to describe people, everyone has their own stories and their weird quirks, but it is true that some people are just less interesting than others. It\u2019s almost as if duller people have these few clunky characteristics that take up all the space, and once you uncover those traits you\u2019re done. Nothing else to dig for. But /you/, Phil Lester, were not one of those people. The more you dug the more things there were to uncover. There was the top layer of course, your creativity, the lame sense of humor that everyone seemed to enjoy, and the almost tangible gentleness that wafted off of you in bunches. But then I dug deeper and those three split off into six, and six to twelve, and twelve to twenty four and before I knew it was I had dug kilos under with nothing but words and complete infatuation with you. It was like no relationship I had ever found before, it was as if I could sort right through the clutter of your thoughts and headaches easier than if they were my own. You were the same with me too. Every word we spoke together was written in invisible ink that only we could see floating through the atmosphere and we could read right through even the messiest of sentences. I miss that the most. I\u2019ve tried with new friends, but I haven\u2019t been able to find someone has /intriguing/ as you, and no one has been able to decipher the language of Daniel Howell the way you did. </p><p><i>Phil</i></p><p>I thought when you left the hardest thing I would have to endure was being without you, but it turned out the hardest thing was having to be alone with myself. You were able to translate all my thoughts without me even saying a word, and now I have to do it by myself. I realized thirty one feels really old when you\u2019re living alone. When we were together it was like the years were just flying by. I don\u2019t think that I once stopped to realize how old I was, and it\u2019s all catching up to me now. I\u2019ve always been a strong believer that your age shouldn\u2019t dictate your quality of life. I don\u2019t think you should feel obligated to be think or act a certain type of way when you hit age thirty, but it\u2019s a lot harder when you actually are living through it. I never really put much thought into my future plans once I met you, I knew from the moment I hugged you at the train station that I was going to spend the rest of my life with you. Well, maybe I didn\u2019t know that, but I was confident as hell in it. So I never put much thought into a long term career, or buying a house, or even raising a family, I had always just imagined it would come when the time was right. I wanted to get married though, it was the one thing I had planned. I wanted to propose as soon as we got home from the tour, the timing felt so right, we had accomplished so much so why not top it off with the biggest celebration of them all? But that was the one time I made plans, and now I don\u2019t know how to anymore. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p><i>Dan</i></p><p>It was almost two in the morning on a Friday night when we found the floor plans to this flat. You opened the photos and the glazed coating covering your eyes was polished off and replaced with glittering excitement. The pictures showed huge floor to ceiling windows that opened to the navy blue Atlantic, and as soon as I saw the look in your eyes I knew that no matter the price, I was going to be living in that flat. As simple as it was, it was your dream come true basically. Finding flats in London with those windows was virtually impossible, let alone with a view like that, and I knew that if I were there, you would be there in a sense too, looking through those same windows. But things are different now. When I stare out those windows, to the choppy grey waves of the Atlantic, I swear they stare right back at me. Taunting me with their ease and grace, moving so nimbly through the motions. When the waves come crashing onto shore, the backwash always comes in perfect time. It\u2019s as if they\u2019re mocking my inelegance and the harmonies I couldn\u2019t seem to keep. It infuriates me. I want to run into the icy waves and shout until my voice is raw, but I can\u2019t help but feel an attachment to them. They\u2019re the closest I can to you, but you\u2019re also the reason why I despise them. </p><p><i>Phil</i></p><p>It feels like I\u2019m frozen solid. It\u2019s like the soles of my shoes have become one with the sand underneath and every step I take moves the whole beach along with it. It\u2019s always the same. No matter how many layers I wear, there\u2019s always an impossible frigidness blowing in from the sea. I\u2019m not sure if the air manages to get colder every time I put on another jumper, or if I\u2019m just not used to being alone yet. Maybe it\u2019s both. I\u2019ve ended up abandoning a coat altogether, I\u2019ll be just as cold with one, so why do it at all? Even though it\u2019s icy and uninviting this time of year, I come down to the shore for hours at a time, I\u2019ll just sit and gaze into the grey billows until my fingers and toes go numb and the wind burn on my cheeks is too much to bear. It sounds pathetic, but I feel closest to you here. Maybe the wind will carry your warm cologne smell or the peach colored tones of your voice. Maybe you\u2019re looking right back at me, through the huge bay windows of your apartment. Looking across 5,000 kilometers of shimmering blue waters, gazing at me with that same infatuation you had all those years ago, but then again, you might not be looking at all. </p>",

I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m troubled by it or proud in some twisted way, but I know that I overthink, and I know that I do it a lot. All I can think about now a days is you and the night I got accepted. You being in my thoughts is normal, it\u2019s nearly second nature at this point. \u2018Do I like this? No. Will Phil? Probably.\u2019 You were always a thought in my mind, sometimes even before myself. But I haven\u2019t stopped thinking about that night since we parted ways. I stared at you with this huge grin and before I could even say a word my mouth was preoccupied with your own. You pulled me into this huge hug, and we were just so content, but still excited for the future. Thinking back, we never really talked about what was going to happen, though in my mind you were coming to New York with me, but for once I didn\u2019t know what you were thinking. You must have slept on the idea, and realized that moving halfway across the world to stay with me was something you just couldn\u2019t do. You didn\u2019t want leave your family for that long, especially to be in a foreign country. I was hurt, and it still aches now, but I understood. We had done long distance before, how hard could it be? I remember when we first started talking. It was easier back then, the whole long distance thing at least. It was something to keep us going. We knew that we were young, and while the world around is 24,000 miles there were only 300 between us. Then after the daily five hour skype calls and late night twitter conversations we finally met at that Manchester train station. I remember the October air was unbelievably cold, but as soon as you pulled me into that hug I felt like I could\u2019ve melted. And even after the first phil is not on fire and those intimate nights curled up next to you, it still felt like the butterflies fluttering in my stomach could suffocate me with one doe eyed look from you. I don\u2019t know when that feeling stopped. I wish it hadn\u2019t. </p><p><i>Phil </i></p><p>I don\u2019t remember losing feelings for you. I\u2019m not sure I ever did. If you were to look me over with your chestnut brown eyes right now, I think I\u2019d feel same fluttering feeling as I did all those years ago, maybe even stronger now. I remember the night where we were sat on the roof of our old flat watching as the snow fell in clumps onto the dirty cement. It was late, so late that you couldn\u2019t tell whether the sallow hues in the sky were from the bleached moonlight or the pale sun. You had been fast asleep only minutes before, but I was wide awake, and the snow was coming down heavy. You always complained about the frigid air and how dirty snow in the city looked, but I knew how much you loved it, and I knew how much you would love seeing it before it was dirtied by the cars on the road and the ash in the sky. I remember dragging the heels of my boots through the already thick blanket as you watched me from your sitting place on an exposed pipe. I never truly saw you looking at me, but I could tell you were. Maybe we really could read each other\u2019s minds, because even while you hid your face behind your scarf, I could tell you were taking in everything with those soft eyes and grinning at the clicheness of it all. The butterflies in my stomach were almost tickling my throat from the way you were looking at me, and it was in those moments I realized that even though we were in our third flat together, and nearing eight years of knowing each other, I would never find someone like you ever again.</p><p><i>Dan</i></p><p>I don\u2019t like using the word \u201cboring\u201d to describe people, everyone has their own stories and their weird quirks, but it is true that some people are just less interesting than others. It\u2019s almost as if duller people have these few clunky characteristics that take up all the space, and once you uncover those traits you\u2019re done. Nothing else to dig for. But /you/, Phil Lester, were not one of those people. The more you dug the more things there were to uncover. There was the top layer of course, your creativity, the lame sense of humor that everyone seemed to enjoy, and the almost tangible gentleness that wafted off of you in bunches. But then I dug deeper and those three split off into six, and six to twelve, and twelve to twenty four and before I knew it was I had dug kilos under with nothing but words and complete infatuation with you. It was like no relationship I had ever found before, it was as if I could sort right through the clutter of your thoughts and headaches easier than if they were my own. You were the same with me too. Every word we spoke together was written in invisible ink that only we could see floating through the atmosphere and we could read right through even the messiest of sentences. I miss that the most. I\u2019ve tried with new friends, but I haven\u2019t been able to find someone has /intriguing/ as you, and no one has been able to decipher the language of Daniel Howell the way you did. </p><p><i>Phil</i></p><p>I thought when you left the hardest thing I would have to endure was being without you, but it turned out the hardest thing was having to be alone with myself. You were able to translate all my thoughts without me even saying a word, and now I have to do it by myself. I realized thirty one feels really old when you\u2019re living alone. When we were together it was like the years were just flying by. I don\u2019t think that I once stopped to realize how old I was, and it\u2019s all catching up to me now. I\u2019ve always been a strong believer that your age shouldn\u2019t dictate your quality of life. I don\u2019t think you should feel obligated to be think or act a certain type of way when you hit age thirty, but it\u2019s a lot harder when you actually are living through it. I never really put much thought into my future plans once I met you, I knew from the moment I hugged you at the train station that I was going to spend the rest of my life with you. Well, maybe I didn\u2019t know that, but I was confident as hell in it. So I never put much thought into a long term career, or buying a house, or even raising a family, I had always just imagined it would come when the time was right. I wanted to get married though, it was the one thing I had planned. I wanted to propose as soon as we got home from the tour, the timing felt so right, we had accomplished so much so why not top it off with the biggest celebration of them all? But that was the one time I made plans, and now I don\u2019t know how to anymore. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p><i>Dan</i></p><p>It was almost two in the morning on a Friday night when we found the floor plans to this flat. You opened the photos and the glazed coating covering your eyes was polished off and replaced with glittering excitement. The pictures showed huge floor to ceiling windows that opened to the navy blue Atlantic, and as soon as I saw the look in your eyes I knew that no matter the price, I was going to be living in that flat. As simple as it was, it was your dream come true basically. Finding flats in London with those windows was virtually impossible, let alone with a view like that, and I knew that if I were there, you would be there in a sense too, looking through those same windows. But things are different now. When I stare out those windows, to the choppy grey waves of the Atlantic, I swear they stare right back at me. Taunting me with their ease and grace, moving so nimbly through the motions. When the waves come crashing onto shore, the backwash always comes in perfect time. It\u2019s as if they\u2019re mocking my inelegance and the harmonies I couldn\u2019t seem to keep. It infuriates me. I want to run into the icy waves and shout until my voice is raw, but I can\u2019t help but feel an attachment to them. They\u2019re the closest I can to you, but you\u2019re also the reason why I despise them. </p><p><i>Phil</i></p><p>It feels like I\u2019m frozen solid. It\u2019s like the soles of my shoes have become one with the sand underneath and every step I take moves the whole beach along with it. It\u2019s always the same. No matter how many layers I wear, there\u2019s always an impossible frigidness blowing in from the sea. I\u2019m not sure if the air manages to get colder every time I put on another jumper, or if I\u2019m just not used to being alone yet. Maybe it\u2019s both. I\u2019ve ended up abandoning a coat altogether, I\u2019ll be just as cold with one, so why do it at all? Even though it\u2019s icy and uninviting this time of year, I come down to the shore for hours at a time, I\u2019ll just sit and gaze into the grey billows until my fingers and toes go numb and the wind burn on my cheeks is too much to bear. It sounds pathetic, but I feel closest to you here. Maybe the wind will carry your warm cologne smell or the peach colored tones of your voice. Maybe you\u2019re looking right back at me, through the huge bay windows of your apartment. Looking across 5,000 kilometers of shimmering blue waters, gazing at me with that same infatuation you had all those years ago, but then again, you might not be looking at all. </p>",
