Well no not exactly, He had expected to see Pepper considering Tony had been in Europe handling an Avengers issue, but he had expected Tony to at least be on the phone. What he dint expect was to find Pepper like this, with her back turned to him, shaking. </p><p>\u201cPepper?\u201d</p><p>She immediately straightened her back upon hearing his voice, she turned around trying to look as calm as possible, but Peter saw the way her eyes were puffier than usual and the tears still sliding down her face. Peters heart immediately began to race, he knew this wasn\u2019t an update on his suit. </p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit down\u201d </p><p>Peter approached the chair in front of him as though at any moment it could jump at him. With every step Peter\u2019s heart rate increased. He knew the news wasn\u2019t going to be good, he tried to run through every possible scenario, praying it wasn\u2019t the one he was avoiding. </p><p>Finally Pepper spoke again, after attempting to compose herself. </p><p>\u201cI-it\u2019s Tony</p><p>H-he\u2019s </p><p>Gone\u201d </p><p>\u201cGone? What do you mean gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cD-dead\u201d</p><p>Pepper broke down. She quickly excused herself from the room giving Peter no further detail, he didn\u2019t need it. He knew he should go after her and attempt to show her comfort or support but he couldn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t do anything but sit there. He recognized the feelings in his stomach and throat but he didn\u2019t want to. He was sick of this. Sick of finally finding someone and almost immediately losing them. He could feel hot tears welling up in his eyes. He clenched his teeth and balled his fists. He couldn\u2019t do it again. Peter kicked over the chair he had been sitting on. He walked over to the counter where just days ago him and his mentor were working on a formula for his web serum. There was still a scrap of paper with a basis formula written by Tony. Peter couldn\u2019t stand the sight of it, of Tonys handwriting, he ripped it up. Everything in the lab was making Peter more and more frustrated, everything was reminding him of the third father figure he had lost in his life. He was sick of losing everything he loved. He ran out of the lab and out of the tower. On his way out Happy had tried to slow him down insisting on giving him a ride but Peter couldn\u2019t concentrate on that or anything in that god damn tower. </p><p>He ran all the way back to his apartment where he found the suit lying on his bed, the suit made for him by- he couldn\u2019t bring himself to even think the name, he took the suit and threw it out the door. When he returned to his room he turned to his bulletin board, filled with pictures and mementos from the man he lost. Peter immediately began pulling and ripping and throwing into the trash until the wall was clean of evidence of the mans existence.  </p><p>After that Peter looked into the mirror. His eyes weren\u2019t drawn to his red nose and cheeks or the tear lines running down his face, they were drawn to his curls. The curls Mr Stark loved running his hands through when Spider-man had done an exceptionally good job or when Peter was having a panic attack, Mr Stark knew just how to calm him down. But Mr Stark wasn\u2019t here anymore, and Peter was sick of the reminders of him. He found a pair of scissors on his desk and raised them to his hairline. He began to snip every last curl away, soon he had only a thin layer of hair on his head and one clump of curl remaining. He shakily brought the scissors to his head but at the last minute dropped them. Peter collapsed onto the floor and leg himself sob. Sob for his father and mother for his lost uncle and his mentor. He couldn\u2019t wrap his mind around all that was happening, all the thoughts racing through his mind. The only thing he knew was his hands around his head and his knees on the floor. He wanted-needed to push everything else out. </p><p>Peter could no longer tell the time when he heard the keys clicking frantically and the door swinging open. Feet were racing towards his room. May. </p><p>\u201cPeter I saw on the news. How are yo-\u201c</p><p>She was cut off by seeing the teenager huddled on the floor surrounded by hair and practically drenched in sweat and tears. His big red eyes looked up to her. Peter knee he looked pathetic but he couldn\u2019t help it. His life was crumbling around him. Nothing mattered. </p><p>May crouched down and wrapped her arms around him pulling him into a hug. They sat like that for hours in silence. With Peter sobbing into May like she was the only thing left in existence to hold onto. When May finally released him she cupped his face into her hands and looked at his puffy red face.</p><p>\u201cPeter, I don\u2019t have to tell you life is hard. When you think you\u2019re standing on solid ground another rug gets pulled out from under your feet and you have to start over again. But if I can tell you one things it\u2019s that this,\u201d May motioned around the room at the carnage of Peters outburst, \u201cisn\u2019t the answer. Destroying every evidence of the person won\u2019t make the pain go away. Trust me I\u2019ve tried. What we need to do is think about what Tony would want. He would want you to move on. And you can\u2019t do that immediately but destroying everything that reminds you of him is only going to hold you back. You understand?\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded. May kisses him on the forehead and then twisted his last curl around her finger while clicking her tongue. </p><p>\u201cAnd sweetie lets leave haircuts to the professionals from now on okay?\u201d</p><p>Peter tried to crack a smile but it came out weak and defeated. May placed another kiss on his forehead. </p><p>\u201cDo you need some time alone?\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded slowly. When May left he got up and walked to his trash can. There was a photo of him and Tony on top, surprisingly not ripped. Peter picked it up held it in his hands for a couple minutes, letting tears run down his face. He pinned it back up on his wall and proceeded to go through the rest on the trash. </p><p>May was right. Tony wanted Peter to move on, but it didn\u2019t come easily. In fact it took almost 2 years, but eventually Peter was able to think about the time he had with his mentor and smile at all the thing he had taught him. And even the worst times brought a smile to Peters face. </p>",

He could feel hot tears welling up in his eyes. He clenched his teeth and balled his fists. He couldn\u2019t do it again. Peter kicked over the chair he had been sitting on. He walked over to the counter where just days ago him and his mentor were working on a formula for his web serum. There was still a scrap of paper with a basis formula written by Tony. Peter couldn\u2019t stand the sight of it, of Tonys handwriting, he ripped it up. Everything in the lab was making Peter more and more frustrated, everything was reminding him of the third father figure he had lost in his life. He was sick of losing everything he loved. He ran out of the lab and out of the tower. On his way out Happy had tried to slow him down insisting on giving him a ride but Peter couldn\u2019t concentrate on that or anything in that god damn tower. </p><p>He ran all the way back to his apartment where he found the suit lying on his bed, the suit made for him by- he couldn\u2019t bring himself to even think the name, he took the suit and threw it out the door. When he returned to his room he turned to his bulletin board, filled with pictures and mementos from the man he lost. Peter immediately began pulling and ripping and throwing into the trash until the wall was clean of evidence of the mans existence.  </p><p>After that Peter looked into the mirror. His eyes weren\u2019t drawn to his red nose and cheeks or the tear lines running down his face, they were drawn to his curls. The curls Mr Stark loved running his hands through when Spider-man had done an exceptionally good job or when Peter was having a panic attack, Mr Stark knew just how to calm him down. But Mr Stark wasn\u2019t here anymore, and Peter was sick of the reminders of him. He found a pair of scissors on his desk and raised them to his hairline. He began to snip every last curl away, soon he had only a thin layer of hair on his head and one clump of curl remaining. He shakily brought the scissors to his head but at the last minute dropped them. Peter collapsed onto the floor and leg himself sob. Sob for his father and mother for his lost uncle and his mentor. He couldn\u2019t wrap his mind around all that was happening, all the thoughts racing through his mind. The only thing he knew was his hands around his head and his knees on the floor. He wanted-needed to push everything else out. </p><p>Peter could no longer tell the time when he heard the keys clicking frantically and the door swinging open. Feet were racing towards his room. May. </p><p>\u201cPeter I saw on the news. How are yo-\u201c</p><p>She was cut off by seeing the teenager huddled on the floor surrounded by hair and practically drenched in sweat and tears. His big red eyes looked up to her. Peter knee he looked pathetic but he couldn\u2019t help it. His life was crumbling around him. Nothing mattered. </p><p>May crouched down and wrapped her arms around him pulling him into a hug. They sat like that for hours in silence. With Peter sobbing into May like she was the only thing left in existence to hold onto. When May finally released him she cupped his face into her hands and looked at his puffy red face.</p><p>\u201cPeter, I don\u2019t have to tell you life is hard. When you think you\u2019re standing on solid ground another rug gets pulled out from under your feet and you have to start over again. But if I can tell you one things it\u2019s that this,\u201d May motioned around the room at the carnage of Peters outburst, \u201cisn\u2019t the answer. Destroying every evidence of the person won\u2019t make the pain go away. Trust me I\u2019ve tried. What we need to do is think about what Tony would want. He would want you to move on. And you can\u2019t do that immediately but destroying everything that reminds you of him is only going to hold you back. You understand?\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded. May kisses him on the forehead and then twisted his last curl around her finger while clicking her tongue. </p><p>\u201cAnd sweetie lets leave haircuts to the professionals from now on okay?\u201d</p><p>Peter tried to crack a smile but it came out weak and defeated. May placed another kiss on his forehead. </p><p>\u201cDo you need some time alone?\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded slowly. When May left he got up and walked to his trash can. There was a photo of him and Tony on top, surprisingly not ripped. Peter picked it up held it in his hands for a couple minutes, letting tears run down his face. He pinned it back up on his wall and proceeded to go through the rest on the trash. </p><p>May was right. Tony wanted Peter to move on, but it didn\u2019t come easily. In fact it took almost 2 years, but eventually Peter was able to think about the time he had with his mentor and smile at all the thing he had taught him. And even the worst times brought a smile to Peters face. </p>",
