The second being the very first episode, where adventurous Arya looked excited with the very same facial expression when she spotted King Robert and the Lannister army.

Maybe Sansa telling Jon that Queen Dany cannot have him, like Cat told Ned? <br/></p><p>Anyway I think it is a very interesting shot. I\u2019m not yet sure, if Arya gazing at a dragon above really comes directly after the other scene, but it might well be.

I\u2019m a true Stark.\u201d She stepped back to admire her work once more.</p><p>\u201cIs that why your toes are blue?\u201d Daenerys pointed at Arya\u2019s bare feet and Arya shrugged her shoulders when she saw that her toes were indeed a little blueish. </p><p>And now Daenerys had mentioned it, maybe they also stung a little, just like her hands and ears.

He probably wouldn\u2019t even feel it if I did. When they find who he is and cut off his stupid mulehead, he\u2019ll be sorry he didn\u2019t help. She was better off without him anyhow.
