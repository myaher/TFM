The Force was practically shaking him by the lapels now. Whatever he was looking for, whatever was stirring up the Force like this, it was right in front of him.</p><p>There was a boy, no more than seventeen, eighteen years of age, with sun-bleached hair and stained coveralls that might have once been a flight suit.

He hissed in pain and shook off a few droplets of blood, then amazingly, went right back to what he was doing. </p><p>&ldquo;Did you know you&rsquo;ve got a busted gear in the hydraulics for the ramp?&rdquo; he asked in a surprisingly level voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s small now, but it&rsquo;s one of those things that does cumulative damage if you leave it unaddressed. I figured I&rsquo;d replace it while the shuttle was here. Don&rsquo;t worry, Uncle Owen never adds my extra repairs to the bill.&rdquo;</p><p>Upon examination, Vader could grudgingly admit that the boy was right. And despite himself, he was faintly impressed. You had to know what you were doing to spot that kind of issue without a droid running a diagnostic for you.</p><p>&ldquo;This is an asteroid colony with limited supplies. Just what were you intending to use as a replacement gear?&rdquo; he asked, more curious than he wanted to be.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, most Sienar Fleet Systems products take really specific parts. Aunt Beru says it&rsquo;s probably so they can charge more for repairs, and I tend to believe her. But they&rsquo;ve been using the same standard gear for the Lambda class shuttle since the borrowed half the design from the Clone Wars. It&rsquo;s not too difficult to improvise a replacement part in an pinch.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know your ships,&rdquo; Vader admitted grudgingly.</p><p>&ldquo;I love flying,&rdquo; the boy answered honestly, his answer shining almost literally in the Force with his enthusiasm. &ldquo;And I have a soft spot for Lambdas, since that&rsquo;s what got my family off of Tatooine.&rdquo; He grimaced as he said the name of the planet, as if he&rsquo;d bitten down on something unpleasant. Surprisingly, Vader could relate.</p><p>&ldquo;You are bleeding in my hydraulics system,&rdquo; he observed dryly. </p><p>&ldquo;Aw kriff, I am! I&rsquo;m sorry!&rdquo; The boy yanked his hands back and grabbed for a cleaning rag to dab at the little, bright droplets. </p><p>And then it finally seemed to hit him that he was standing under a shuttle, talking shop with <i>Darth Vader. </i></p><p>The young man rocketed back and stared up at him with wide, suspicious eyes, every muscle tensed to run. Surprising that it had taken that long. But Darth Vader was less focused on his behavior than on his face. Now that he got a good look at him, now that he could actually see his features, there was a terrible similarity. An impossible similarity. This was absolutely what the Force had been all but howling about, but why-? Who-?</p><p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he demanded, taking a step forward.</p><p>&ldquo;L-l-luke Skywalker,&rdquo; the boy stammered, wiping blood, oil, and other mechanical fluids off on his pant legs.</p><p><i>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo;</i></p><p>Luke swallowed hard, and tried again. &ldquo;M-my name is Luke Skywalker&hellip;my uncle runs the repair business?&rdquo; His voice was barely more than a whispered squeak.</p><p>For some reason, this seemed to enrage Vader. Luke tried to present a smaller target as the man &ndash; was he a man? He wasn&rsquo;t a droid, right? &ndash; took another menacing step forward. </p><p>&ldquo;Who are your parents?&rdquo; he hissed.</p><p>&ldquo;Um his&hellip;my father&rsquo;s name was Anakin, I&hellip;don&rsquo;t know my mother&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; Luke gulped, wondering why that had any bearing on the situation, &ldquo;They died when I was a baby&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>As best Vader could tell from the Force, nothing the young man was saying was a lie. But that was impossible! Utterly impossible! <i>Someone</i> was lying here. Perhaps the boy believed what he was saying, but that didn&rsquo;t make it true. But there was a way to find out. He grabbed Luke by the shoulder and hauled him out from under the shuttle with him.</p><p>&ldquo;We are going to have a <i>conversation</i> with this uncle of yours,&rdquo; he said in a decidedly threatening tone.</p><p>Luke could not possibly have been more confused. </p>",
