Game of Thrones has been known to hype stuff in the promotional material that doesn\u2019t happen in the show. For instance, they tried to fake us out with Dark! Sansa and that didn\u2019t happen. They tried to fake us out with\u00a0\u2018Jon is really dead\u2019 and that did not happen. But the wierd thing about the dark tone of the Targaryen video is that its&hellip;kind of an outlier?</p><p>Like all the other promotional material for Daenerys in the past seasons has been positive. She\u2019s always been presented in a pretty heroic light, or at least in as heroic a light as everyone else. And even the promotional material in this seasion doesn\u2019t suggest Targ!bowl. There is very little talk about\u00a0\u2018what will the truth of Jon\u2019s parentage do?\u2019 At most there\u2019s a suggestion that Sansa might not like Daenerys\u00a0\u201cat first\u201d. But no conflict between Dany in Jon. According to the interviews and magazines they are together! They are in love! Not so secret lovers! United to save the world!</p><p>And this video&hellip;has a totally different tone. And I don\u2019t know if it was incompetence or something intentional at this point but&hellip;let\u2019s talk about it for a second.</p><p>Disclaimer before we go into this: This is not a hating on Daenerys post. I\u2019ve said before that I am pretty neutral on her character and I do not have a ship influencing me in this case. As usual I am going to try to be objective and just look at the video as I see it.</p><p>1. A Word on Video Editing</p><p>You can make ANY character seem heroic/evil with video editing. Just pick the right music and choose the right clips and its easy. I could make all of the Game of Thrones characters look evil if I wanted to. And I\u2019ve watched a lot of Game of Thrones tributes including Hero!Dany tributes AND Dark!Dany tributes. They\u2019re all very well executed and well done videos!</p><p>I discussed in my post on\u00a0\u2018the many readings of Daenerys\u2019 that Hero!Dany fans mostly pay attention to her good deeds. Freeing slaves, locking away her dragons when they get out of control, her moments of mercy etc. On the other hand Dark! Dany fans focus primarily on her bad deeds. The more aggressive burnings and executions for example, and the fact that she seems to struggle more with ruling that conquering. But what I hope I made clear is that her good points and bad points BOTH EXIST. I hate to quote Stannis here (because I don\u2019t like him) but\u00a0\u201ca good deed does not wash out the bad, nor the bad the good\u201d. What determines a character\u2019s story is whether they give into their darker impulses or their better impulses. Theorists argue, of course, over which of Dany\u2019s qualities matter more.</p><p>Video editing is the same you pick what clips you want to focus on. You pick the lines. You pick the music. And who ever edited this video was focusing way more on a darker Daenerys.</p><p>So this Targaryen video was so similar to so many of the Dark! Dany tributes because of the clips they selected. They could have easily done a heroic Dany tribute. Pick clips of her emotionally vulnerable moments! Pick clips of her freeing the slaves! Pick clips of her vowing to help Jon whether he bends the knee or not! Pick clips of her and Jon being united with one cause! There\u2019s plenty to choose from. But what does the video choose?</p><p>First off, they spent almost a full minute on Aerys! And not Aerys alone. They also showed clips of Daenerys intersperced with him. So this isn\u2019t a situation of Aerys is the past but Daenerys is the future. She is put along side her father in the video. It\u2019s quick, but it was a choice.</p><p>Second off, most of the scenes they picked involve Daenerys as the aggressor. There are exceptions like the Mhysa clip. But mostly its stuff with Daenerys riding her dragons and burning things. Then there\u2019s the lines they choose to include.\u00a0\u201cIf you choose to melt castles and burn cities, you\u2019re no different. You\u2019re just more of the same\u201d says Jon Snow, over a clip of Daenerys\u2019 dragons setting things on fire, followed swiftly by a close up threatening shot of Drogon\u2019s teeth. They didn\u2019t choose Jon petting the dragon here. They chose the threatening part before.</p><p>They also, toward the end, include Tyrion and Varys conversation.\u00a0\u201cDaenerys is not her father.\u201d\u00a0\u201cAnd she never will be with the right council. You need to make her listen\u201d. This implies that Daenerys listening is still a big issue and also implies that she COULD become like her father. Once again, there are any number of other lines they could have chosen. Such as \u201cshe checks her worse impulses\u201d or \u201cchildren are not their fathers, lucky for us\u201d. But they went with that.</p><p>Some of the lines they have are morally neutral. Like Tyrion\u2019s line about Daenerys\u2019 story. And the\u00a0\u2018breaking the wheel\u2019 line which I think is an overall positive idea, depending on how Dany actually does it. There is also the\u00a0\u201ca Targaryen alone in the world is a terrible thing\u201d line, which could be considered more sympathetic if not for the absolutely sinister music that plays beneath when he suggested\u00a0\u201cno one to guide her\u201d. This seems to imply that Daenerys\u2019 lack of guidance and having to make it on her own might be what nudged her toward her darker impulses? But there\u2019s very little of her softer, kinder side in this video. There is very little of her heroic side in this video.</p><p>And then of course&hellip;there\u2019s how they chose to end it. Not with Daenerys&hellip;but with Jon.</p><p>How a video ends is important. The last line is what we remember. And in this case we end with\u00a0\u201che is the heir to the iron throne\u201d in reference to Jon. As if to\u00a0\u201ccorrect\u201d Dany shortly after she has said\u00a0\u201cI am the last Targaryen\u201d. This, more than anything, makes it seem like Dany isn\u2019t going to take the reveal all to well. To be fair, I don\u2019t think anyone would.</p><p>But the video in isolation isn\u2019t all that matters. Let\u2019s talk about&hellip;</p><p>2) How it compares to the other videos</p><p>If the Stark video was also more sinister than it could just be a tone problem. But there is not one sinister thing in the Stark video. The music his heroic. There is no hint of a conflict between the Starks. No clips of when they have been in opposistion. Only clips of them being seperated but then coming back together as one. We end the video with:\u00a0\u2018the pack survives\u2019 which suggested the Starks are going to be united. And Jon starts the video as well! He is more involved in the Stark video than the Targaryen (and wasn\u2019t included in the\u00a0\u2018a Targaryen alone in the world is a terrible thing\u2019 clip in the first video). It certainly shows some of the\u00a0\u2018darker\u2019 Stark acts but not with any sort of sinister tone.</p><p>It is also the ONLY VIDEO that really involves the Others in any capacity. The Others, the main threat, could have easily been included in the Targaryen video as part of her destiny. But instead they make it seem primarily like a Stark problem that they must face together.</p><p>The Lannister video is, naturally, sinister, because it has Cersei who is a known villain. But it\u2019s got a similar kind of music beneath it which makes the choices in the Lannister and Targaryen video seem similar? As if they are both a threat? It\u2019s very strange.</p><p>In Conclusion:</p><p>I don\u2019t think this video proves anything, because promotion is always full of curve balls. But the choice can\u2019t be dismissed. It might not foreshadow a Dark! Dany so much as a conflict between Jon and Dany when they find out. Maybe they\u2019ll do a fakeout like with the Stark sister drama, but then they\u2019ll come back together again. Or maybe HBO is trying to subtly prepare us for Dark!Dany</p><p>Nothing is certain til Season 8 drops. But since Daenerys has been marketed as a hero almost exclusively, this video did surprise me. So I\u2019m not ruling out any of the possibilities I talked about in my Daenerys parallels post. They\u2019re all still free game. But this one is the first of the promo videos to tilt in favor of Dark Daenerys. We\u2019ll see how she looks in the trailer!</p>",

Game of Thrones has been known to hype stuff in the promotional material that doesn\u2019t happen in the show. For instance, they tried to fake us out with Dark! Sansa and that didn\u2019t happen. They tried to fake us out with\u00a0\u2018Jon is really dead\u2019 and that did not happen. But the wierd thing about the dark tone of the Targaryen video is that its\u2026kind of an outlier?</p><p>Like all the other promotional material for Daenerys in the past seasons has been positive. She\u2019s always been presented in a pretty heroic light, or at least in as heroic a light as everyone else. And even the promotional material in this seasion doesn\u2019t suggest Targ!bowl. There is very little talk about\u00a0\u2018what will the truth of Jon\u2019s parentage do?\u2019 At most there\u2019s a suggestion that Sansa might not like Daenerys\u00a0\u201cat first\u201d. But no conflict between Dany in Jon. According to the interviews and magazines they are together! They are in love! Not so secret lovers! United to save the world!</p><p>And this video\u2026has a totally different tone. And I don\u2019t know if it was incompetence or something intentional at this point but\u2026let\u2019s talk about it for a second.</p><p>Disclaimer before we go into this: This is not a hating on Daenerys post. I\u2019ve said before that I am pretty neutral on her character and I do not have a ship influencing me in this case. As usual I am going to try to be objective and just look at the video as I see it.</p><p>1. A Word on Video Editing</p><p>You can make ANY character seem heroic/evil with video editing. Just pick the right music and choose the right clips and its easy. I could make all of the Game of Thrones characters look evil if I wanted to. And I\u2019ve watched a lot of Game of Thrones tributes including Hero!Dany tributes AND Dark!Dany tributes. They\u2019re all very well executed and well done videos!</p><p>I discussed in my post on\u00a0\u2018the many readings of Daenerys\u2019 that Hero!Dany fans mostly pay attention to her good deeds. Freeing slaves, locking away her dragons when they get out of control, her moments of mercy etc. On the other hand Dark! Dany fans focus primarily on her bad deeds. The more aggressive burnings and executions for example, and the fact that she seems to struggle more with ruling that conquering. But what I hope I made clear is that her good points and bad points BOTH EXIST. I hate to quote Stannis here (because I don\u2019t like him) but\u00a0\u201ca good deed does not wash out the bad, nor the bad the good\u201d. What determines a character\u2019s story is whether they give into their darker impulses or their better impulses. Theorists argue, of course, over which of Dany\u2019s qualities matter more.</p><p>Video editing is the same you pick what clips you want to focus on. You pick the lines. You pick the music. And who ever edited this video was focusing way more on a darker Daenerys.</p><p>So this Targaryen video was so similar to so many of the Dark! Dany tributes because of the clips they selected. They could have easily done a heroic Dany tribute. Pick clips of her emotionally vulnerable moments! Pick clips of her freeing the slaves! Pick clips of her vowing to help Jon whether he bends the knee or not! Pick clips of her and Jon being united with one cause! There\u2019s plenty to choose from. But what does the video choose?</p><p>First off, they spent almost a full minute on Aerys! And not Aerys alone. They also showed clips of Daenerys intersperced with him. So this isn\u2019t a situation of Aerys is the past but Daenerys is the future. She is put along side her father in the video. It\u2019s quick, but it was a choice.</p><p>Second off, most of the scenes they picked involve Daenerys as the aggressor. There are exceptions like the Mhysa clip. But mostly its stuff with Daenerys riding her dragons and burning things. Then there\u2019s the lines they choose to include.\u00a0\u201cIf you choose to melt castles and burn cities, you\u2019re no different. You\u2019re just more of the same\u201d says Jon Snow, over a clip of Daenerys\u2019 dragons setting things on fire, followed swiftly by a close up threatening shot of Drogon\u2019s teeth. They didn\u2019t choose Jon petting the dragon here. They chose the threatening part before.</p><p>They also, toward the end, include Tyrion and Varys conversation.\u00a0\u201cDaenerys is not her father.\u201d\u00a0\u201cAnd she never will be with the right council. You need to make her listen\u201d. This implies that Daenerys listening is still a big issue and also implies that she COULD become like her father. Once again, there are any number of other lines they could have chosen. Such as \u201cshe checks her worse impulses\u201d or \u201cchildren are not their fathers, lucky for us\u201d. But they went with that.</p><p>Some of the lines they have are morally neutral. Like Tyrion\u2019s line about Daenerys\u2019 story. And the\u00a0\u2018breaking the wheel\u2019 line which I think is an overall positive idea, depending on how Dany actually does it. There is also the\u00a0\u201ca Targaryen alone in the world is a terrible thing\u201d line, which could be considered more sympathetic if not for the absolutely sinister music that plays beneath when he suggested\u00a0\u201cno one to guide her\u201d. This seems to imply that Daenerys\u2019 lack of guidance and having to make it on her own might be what nudged her toward her darker impulses? But there\u2019s very little of her softer, kinder side in this video. There is very little of her heroic side in this video.</p><p>And then of course\u2026there\u2019s how they chose to end it. Not with Daenerys\u2026but with Jon.</p><p>How a video ends is important. The last line is what we remember. And in this case we end with\u00a0\u201che is the heir to the iron throne\u201d in reference to Jon. As if to\u00a0\u201ccorrect\u201d Dany shortly after she has said\u00a0\u201cI am the last Targaryen\u201d. This, more than anything, makes it seem like Dany isn\u2019t going to take the reveal all to well. To be fair, I don\u2019t think anyone would.</p><p>But the video in isolation isn\u2019t all that matters. Let\u2019s talk about\u2026</p><p>2) How it compares to the other videos</p><p>If the Stark video was also more sinister than it could just be a tone problem. But there is not one sinister thing in the Stark video. The music his heroic. There is no hint of a conflict between the Starks. No clips of when they have been in opposistion. Only clips of them being seperated but then coming back together as one. We end the video with:\u00a0\u2018the pack survives\u2019 which suggested the Starks are going to be united. And Jon starts the video as well! He is more involved in the Stark video than the Targaryen (and wasn\u2019t included in the\u00a0\u2018a Targaryen alone in the world is a terrible thing\u2019 clip in the first video). It certainly shows some of the\u00a0\u2018darker\u2019 Stark acts but not with any sort of sinister tone.</p><p>It is also the ONLY VIDEO that really involves the Others in any capacity. The Others, the main threat, could have easily been included in the Targaryen video as part of her destiny. But instead they make it seem primarily like a Stark problem that they must face together.</p><p>The Lannister video is, naturally, sinister, because it has Cersei who is a known villain. But it\u2019s got a similar kind of music beneath it which makes the choices in the Lannister and Targaryen video seem similar? As if they are both a threat? It\u2019s very strange.</p><p>In Conclusion:</p><p>I don\u2019t think this video proves anything, because promotion is always full of curve balls. But the choice can\u2019t be dismissed. It might not foreshadow a Dark! Dany so much as a conflict between Jon and Dany when they find out. Maybe they\u2019ll do a fakeout like with the Stark sister drama, but then they\u2019ll come back together again. Or maybe HBO is trying to subtly prepare us for Dark!Dany</p><p>Nothing is certain til Season 8 drops. But since Daenerys has been marketed as a hero almost exclusively, this video did surprise me.
