An angel and a demon aren&rsquo;t quite sure that&rsquo;s what they would call it, but they&rsquo;re along for the ride whether they like it or not. The taste of revolution crawls forward on the air. People will die. People will be freed. Heaven and Hell pick no sides.</p>",

It would be my absolute pleasure to introduce you to what is one thoroughly hilarious and very madcap book that I\u2019m 90% sure will also be a TV series I will love. (Brief Disclaimer: This is my first Pratchett novel. And I\u2019ve never really seen any of his adaptations. Though based on my love for this book and every quote I\u2019ve read of his/heard about him, I\u2019m sure I\u2019d adore his books too.)</p><p>So. <i>Good Omens</i> is basically the story of the Apocalypse, and one Angel and one Demon who are trying to stop it, because after 6,000+ years, they\u2019ve grown quite fond of humanity and Earth. (Aziraphale, the angel, is a huge book nerd who runs a bookshop where he does his best not to sell any of his precious literary belongings, and Crowley, the demon, drives a Bentley that only plays the Best of Queen on a loop, and is a plant dad with a very nice flat. They\u2019re best friends who hang out a lot <strike>and are also pretty much husbands</strike>.) </p><p>When our story begins, the Antichrist has just been born, which means that time is ticking down until the world ends. Thus Aziraphale and Crowley decide that they\u2019re going to join forces \u2014 irrespective of Heaven and Hell\u2019s desires \u2014 and try and prevent the End Times from coming forth. Their big plan? To try and influence his upbringing so they can try and steer him away from evil. There\u2019s only one problem that neither of them accounted for: Human Error. </p><p>Turns out, the babies were accidentally switched at birth and the Antichrist actually went home with a different family and had a relatively <i>normal</i> upbringing (i.e. no angels or demons serving as tutors or nannies or gardeners and trying to sway him to either side). Only now that it\u2019s almost time for the Apocalypse, his powers are kicking in, and <i>that\u2019s</i> where our adventure <i>really</i> gets going. </p><p>I hope you check out and read the book. It\u2019s so much fun. Not quite a mystery or particularly sci-fi, but full of delicious parody and wordplay and humour, all of which has aged beautifully. Feel free to come back and tell me how you found the book, and if you have any Pratchett adaptation recs for me! </p><p>P.S. This was in no way rambly, and you are always welcome to do so in my askbox. </p>",

It would be my absolute pleasure to introduce you to what is one thoroughly hilarious and very madcap book that I\u2019m 90% sure will also be a TV series I will love. (Brief Disclaimer: This is my first Pratchett novel. And I\u2019ve never really seen any of his adaptations. Though based on my love for this book and every quote I\u2019ve read of his/heard about him, I\u2019m sure I\u2019d adore his books too.)</p><p>So. <i>Good Omens</i> is basically the story of the Apocalypse, and one Angel and one Demon who are trying to stop it, because after 6,000+ years, they\u2019ve grown quite fond of humanity and Earth. (Aziraphale, the angel, is a huge book nerd who runs a bookshop where he does his best not to sell any of his precious literary belongings, and Crowley, the demon, drives a Bentley that only plays the Best of Queen on a loop, and is a plant dad with a very nice flat. They\u2019re best friends who hang out a lot <strike>and are also pretty much husbands</strike>.) </p><p>When our story begins, the Antichrist has just been born, which means that time is ticking down until the world ends. Thus Aziraphale and Crowley decide that they\u2019re going to join forces \u2014 irrespective of Heaven and Hell\u2019s desires \u2014 and try and prevent the End Times from coming forth. Their big plan? To try and influence his upbringing so they can try and steer him away from evil. There\u2019s only one problem that neither of them accounted for: Human Error. </p><p>Turns out, the babies were accidentally switched at birth and the Antichrist actually went home with a different family and had a relatively <i>normal</i> upbringing (i.e. no angels or demons serving as tutors or nannies or gardeners and trying to sway him to either side). Only now that it\u2019s almost time for the Apocalypse, his powers are kicking in, and <i>that\u2019s</i> where our adventure <i>really</i> gets going. </p><p>I hope you check out and read the book. It\u2019s so much fun. Not quite a mystery or particularly sci-fi, but full of delicious parody and wordplay and humour, all of which has aged beautifully. Feel free to come back and tell me how you found the book, and if you have any Pratchett adaptation recs for me! </p><p>P.S. This was in no way rambly, and you are always welcome to do so in my askbox. </p>",
