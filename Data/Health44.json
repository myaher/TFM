This story was originally published on April 8.</p> \n  <p>A Consumer Reports investigation into the safety of the Fisher-Price Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper\u2014a product designed and marketed for babies to sleep on an incline\u2014found that it is tied to at least 32 infant deaths.</p> \n  <p>Amid CR\u2019s investigation\u2014and days after we asked for comment\u2014the federal government and Fisher-Price on April 5 issued a warning about the product, which safety advocates believe does not go far enough. Medical experts tell CR that babies should be placed flat on their back alone and free of soft bedding\u2014and not at an incline\u2014to minimize the risk of accidental suffocation. Products such as the Fisher-Price Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper do not align with these recommendations.<br/></p> \n  <p>The safety alert from the <a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2019/CPSC-ALERT-CPSC-and-Fisher-Price-Warn-Consumers-About-Fisher-Price-Rock-N-Play-Due-to-Reports-of-Death-When-Infants-Roll-Over-in-the-Product\" target=\"_blank\">Consumer Product Safety Commission and Fisher-Price</a> includes a warning from the CPSC for consumers to stop using the product when infants turn 3 months old or \u201cas soon as an infant exhibits rollover capabilities.\u201d The alert cites reports of \u201c10 infant deaths in the Rock \u2019n Play that have occurred since 2015, after the infants rolled from their back to their stomach or side, while unrestrained.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Despite these numbers, the product has not been recalled by Fisher-Price, part of the children\u2019s products giant Mattel, which had about $4.5 billion in sales in 2018. The deaths have prompted only warnings from the company and the CPSC, which does not have a mandatory safety standard for infant inclined sleep products.</p> \n  <p>Fisher-Price told CR in an emailed statement, \u201cThe loss of a child is a devastating tragedy. We will continue to do all we can to ensure that parents and caregivers <a href=\"https://fisher-pricesafety.com/?&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI7IHWhre_4QIVEo_ICh2NWQZoEAAYASAAEgLsWfD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\">have the information necessary</a> to create a safe sleep environment for infants.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But CR\u2019s ongoing investigation has turned up deaths of babies even younger than the 3-month threshold cited in the April 5 warning, and go beyond the risk of rollover.</p> \n  <p>Fisher-Price confirmed to CR that the company is aware of approximately 32 fatalities since the 2009 introduction of the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper, including the 10 noted in the joint release with the CPSC. Fisher-Price told CR that the company does not believe that \u201cany deaths have been caused by the product,\u201d citing \u201cthe many situations where a medical/health condition was identified as the cause of death, and/or those in which the product was clearly used in a manner contrary to the safety warnings and instructions.\u201d</p> \n  <p>While CR\u2019s review of the data shows that certain cases did have contributing factors such as illness or additional bedding, the number of incidents associated with the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper, combined with long-standing expert medical advice that babies should sleep on firm, flat surfaces, raises serious safety concerns about the product.\u00a0</p> \n  <figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"500\" data-orig-width=\"770\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en-US/homerun/health.consumerreports.org/40940568ef8082e17303a97d7e133931\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aeae99502635e6735ade711705fb76e2/tumblr_inline_ppvcuvVydn1tyob3m_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"500\" data-orig-width=\"770\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en-US/homerun/health.consumerreports.org/40940568ef8082e17303a97d7e133931\"/></figure><p>Further, the American Academy of Pediatrics says it does not recommend products for routine sleep that require restraining a baby, especially if that product also rocks. \u201cTo [fasten] a baby down to a surface and then rock the baby is not consistent with our recommendations,\u201d said Lori Feldman-Winter, M.D., a member of the AAP task force on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and a professor of pediatrics at Cooper Medical School of Rowan University in Camden, N.J.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBased on the deaths and injuries associated with the Fisher-Price Rock \u2019n Play, the product clearly puts infants\u2019 safety at risk and should be recalled immediately,\u201d says William Wallace, senior policy analyst at CR. \u201cAll other inclined sleepers should be investigated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. These products conflict with American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 safe sleep recommendations, and manufacturers should pull them off the market.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The alert issued Friday by the CPSC and Fisher-Price follows a previous one from the CPSC nearly a year ago, <a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/content/cpsc-consumer-alert-caregivers-urged-to-use-restraints-with-inclined-sleep-products?mod=article_inline\" target=\"_blank\">warning consumers about infant deaths</a>\u00a0associated with inclined sleep products without naming the Fisher-Price Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper.</p> \n  <p>The CPSC told CR in an emailed statement, \u201cAt this time, we are focusing on deaths associated with the rollover hazard, though we acknowledge that we are aware of other deaths that have occurred in the Rock \u2019n Play.\u201d The statement also said that the agency is \u201ccontinuing to evaluate the product and investigate whether it contains a defect &hellip; and if the evidence indicates a need for a recall, we will take that step.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But CR\u2019s investigation\u2014based in part on previously undisclosed CPSC data as well as reviews of lawsuits and interviews with numerous medical experts, product engineers, government and industry officials, and parents\u2014raises questions about how the product was developed and marketed in the first place, and allowed to remain for sale despite incidents dating back many years. It also highlights a larger weakness in the regulatory systems meant to protect consumers, including children, from hazardous products.</p> \n  <h2>A Long List of Deaths</h2> \n  <p>The earliest death that CR uncovered occurred in 2011, with more in the years that followed. There is, for example, the mother in Hidalgo County, Texas, who placed her 2-month old daughter on her back for a night\u2019s sleep on Oct. 19, 2013, according to a lawsuit filed by the family against Fisher-Price. At 4 a.m., when the mother checked, all was well, but by 7 a.m., the baby had stopped breathing. Her head was tilted to the side with her chin on her shoulder, compressing her airway. She was pronounced dead at the scene from positional asphyxia, or an inability to breathe caused by her position.</p> \n  <p>The most recent deaths CR found occurred in spring 2018\u2014one involving a 1-month-old girl in Knoxville, Tenn., and the other a 9-day-old boy in Copperas Cove, Texas.</p> \n  <p>There have also been some close calls. In one, on July 25, 2014, a 7-week-old boy was placed in a Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper while his grandmother was in the room, according to a lawsuit filed against Fisher-Price that was ultimately dismissed.</p> \n  <p>The grandmother, Jan Hinson, of Greenville, S.C., says she looked at her grandson and saw he was \u201ccocked over all the way, and he was blue and lifeless. It was absolutely awful.\u201d She got the infant breathing again, and after a stay in the hospital, he was released.</p> \n  <p>Hinson, who is also a lawyer, is now representing a Virginia couple, Evan and Keenan Overton, whose son died while in a Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper.</p> \n  <p>A few days before Christmas in 2017, 5-month-old Ezra was asleep in the product while Keenan slept on a couch nearby. When Keenan woke in the middle of the night, he found Ezra on his stomach, unresponsive, and yelled for Evan to call 911. \u201cHe was blue, and his body was, it was hard, and he didn\u2019t feel real,\u201d Evan said. Ezra was pronounced dead at the hospital; \u201casphyxia\u201d was listed as the immediate cause of death. (The Overtons say Ezra was buckled in the sleeper, though the death certificate states the baby was unrestrained.)</p> \n  <figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"674\" data-orig-width=\"1199\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en-US/homerun/health.consumerreports.org/914428061489f8e82be00300c62b0434\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b2b1b957e29caecbc21282a07f73f246/tumblr_inline_ppvcuwxOhG1tyob3m_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"674\" data-orig-width=\"1199\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en-US/homerun/health.consumerreports.org/914428061489f8e82be00300c62b0434\"/></figure><p>In the days and weeks following the death, as the Overtons tried to make sense of what happened, they looked online and read about the Fisher-Price Rock \u2019n Play. The new parents had trusted that the product was safe for sleeping because that is how it is marketed. On the Fisher-Price website, the product is touted for \u201cnaptime and nighttime,\u201d and the product\u2019s packaging says things such as \u201cInclined sleeper designed for all-night sleep.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But the couple\u2019s internet searches revealed a different story. There were posts from parents and pediatricians describing the product as dangerous, prone to interfering with an infant\u2019s ability to breathe. The Overtons learned that though sudden infant deaths can occur with no clear cause\u2014and there can be many factors involved\u2014experts warned that this particular product, and infant inclined sleep products in general, pose an increased risk of infant death.</p> \n  <p>The Overtons had received their Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper as a hand-me-down from their neighbors, who had said that, when their child was an infant, the product had been a lifesaver. But, Keenan said, the Overtons became convinced that was \u201cthe opposite of what it was.\u201d</p> \n  <p>On Jan. 6, 2018, Evan posted a review on Amazon warning parents about the product: \u201cI lost my son in this horrible contraption December 22 &hellip; this should not be marketed as a sleeper!&ldquo;</p> \n  <p>When asked by CR about the Overton incident, the company responded, \u201cThe loss of a child is an unimaginable tragedy.\u201d Fisher-Price also confirmed that the Overtons\u2019 case was one of the 10 cited by the company in the joint alert issued with the CPSC on April 5.</p> \n  <h2>History of a Dangerous Product</h2> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.fisher-price.com/en_US/ourstory/rock-n-play-sleeper/index.html\">Fisher-Price</a> says on its website that the company started developing the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper when one of its designers had a baby boy who had trouble sleeping because of acid reflux. The designer\u2019s doctors suggested elevating the infant\u2019s head, prompting her and the company to create a sleeper that would keep her son at a 30-degree incline during sleep.</p> \n  <p>Fisher-Price told CR that it \u201cengaged a leading engineering and scientific consulting firm,\u201d which concluded that the \u201cRock \u2019n Play Sleeper presents a lower risk of fatality than cribs and bassinets/cradles.\u201d<a href=\"https://www.fisher-price.com/en_US/ourstory/rock-n-play-sleeper/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p> \n  <p>Documents filed in an Atlanta lawsuit against Fisher-Price identified a medical consultant hired by the company to be Gary Deegear, M.D., a physician in San Antonio. According to these documents, he offered Fisher-Price assurance about the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper\u2019s safety. For example, Kitty Pilarz\u2014vice president of product safety and regulatory compliance for Mattel\u2014wrote in one email: \u201cDr. Deegear stated pediatricians recommend babies with reflux sleep at 30 degrees, this is just fine, or sleep in a car seat.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But there are several reasons to be concerned about this advice.</p> \n  <p>For one, Deegear is not a pediatrician or a sleep specialist, according to the Texas Medical Board, but was a family practice doctor. CR attempted to contact Deegear but could not reach him for comment.</p> \n  <p>For another, the AAP and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development have long counseled against letting infants sleep unsupervised in a reclined position.</p> \n  <p>Shortly after the recent joint alert from the CPSC and Fisher-Price, the AAP tweeted that \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/healthychildren/status/1114279069120643073\" target=\"_blank\">The Rock \u2019n Play should not be used for routine sleep</a>; If you use the Rock \u2019n Play for soothing, always strap the baby in and never leave the baby unattended.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t recommend that babies are placed to sleep with their heads elevated because that is a position that would be subject to accidental suffocation [and] strangulation in bed,\u201d said Feldman-Winter of the AAP. Instead, the AAP says that for prolonged or nighttime sleep, babies should be put on their backs, unrestrained, alone, on a flat, firm surface, such as a mattress covered by a fitted sheet in a bare crib, bassinet, or play yard.</p> \n  <p>And, experts say, parents should never use a car seat, stroller, swing, sling, wedge, or any other similar product for unsupervised sleep.</p> \n  <p>That recommendation applies even to babies with acid reflux, Feldman-Winter said. She recognizes that some parents have heard that sleeping on an incline can ease that problem and understands the desperation parents can feel when a crying baby can\u2019t sleep. But \u201cthere\u2019s no evidence to suggest that being on an incline is helpful for reflux,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a misconception that that\u2019s somehow an okay, safe sleep position, and it\u2019s just not.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The AAP also doesn\u2019t recommend for routine use sleeping devices that require the use of restraints because a baby could roll or turn into an unsafe position and be incapable of moving, leading to suffocation or strangulation.</p> \n  <p>That\u2019s one of the reasons experts <a href=\"https://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/cribs-are-for-sleeping,-car-seats-are-for-traveling-danger-in-using-sitting-and-carrying-devices-for-sleeping-infants\" target=\"_blank\">caution against using infant car seats for unsupervised sleep</a>. Those products are \u201cacceptable for shorter periods of time because it\u2019s the safest position for a crash,\u201d said Paul Gaudreau, a mechanical engineer who currently works for UPPAbaby and has experience in the car-seat industry. But, he said, <a href=\"https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(15)00345-5/pdf\" target=\"_blank\">research</a>\u00a0(PDF) shows that a <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/Car-Seats-Lower-Oxygen-Levels-of-Newborns.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">baby\u2019s oxygen level can drop</a> when sleeping at an incline in a car seat. And medical experts warn that the straps can lead to strangulation. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve steered companies that I\u2019ve worked for away from doing inclined sleepers.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Finally, the basic advice\u2014that babies should sleep on level, firm surfaces\u2014dates back to 1994, well before Fisher-Price created its Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper. That\u2019s when the AAP and other groups introduced the <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/A-Parents-Guide-to-Safe-Sleep.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cBack to Sleep\u201d campaign</a> to reduce the risk of SIDS and other sleep-related causes of death. That <a href=\"https://safetosleep.nichd.nih.gov/activities/campaign\">campaign</a> (now called \u201c<a href=\"https://safetosleep.nichd.nih.gov/safesleepbasics/about\" target=\"_blank\">Safe to Sleep</a>\u201d) has helped cut the rate of SIDS by almost a half.</p> \n  <p>Roy Benaroch, M.D., an associate adjunct professor of pediatrics at Emory University in Atlanta, who has blogged about the safety risks of the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper, told CR that parents are confused by the product at a time when they are especially vulnerable.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s tough because you don\u2019t sleep, the baby is not sleeping, parents are exhausted, and they\u2019re looking for a solution,\u201d he said. But \u201cparents are assuming a lot of risk by using this rather than following the safety guidelines.\u201d Bottom line: \u201cIf you let your baby sleep in this thing, there\u2019s an increased risk of death,\u201d Benaroch said.</p> \n  <h2>Regulatory Side Steps</h2> \n  <p>When Fisher-Price first introduced the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper, it marketed the product along with its bassinets. But less than a year later, in 2010, the CPSC began revising the standards for infant sleep surfaces, including bassinets, and issued a proposed rule that would require those products to be firm and flat, with an angle of 5 degrees or less when the product was at rest, rather than rocking or swinging.</p> \n  <p>Instead of adjusting the incline of its product, Pilarz, at Mattel, asked the CPSC for a revision to that proposed rule to account for products like the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper. Not making that change, she said, could actually \u201cincrease the risk of injury: Parents deprived of any appropriate product for calming their tired, colicky infants will look elsewhere\u2014and substitute products dangerous for that purpose.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Ultimately, in October 2013, the CPSC excluded products with an incline of greater than 10 degrees from its mandatory bassinet and cradle standards.</p> \n  <p>Armed with that exclusion, Fisher-Price and other industry reps went to ASTM International\u2014an organization that sets voluntary safety standards for consumer products and includes representatives from the government, industry, and the public\u2014to finish a voluntary standard for a new category: inclined infant sleep products.</p> \n  <p>Some ASTM members had objected to creating a new category and standard for those products. \u201cBy putting a standard in, you\u2019re telling people that &hellip; it must be safe,\u201d said Nancy Cowles, executive director of Kids in Danger, a nonprofit that focuses on reducing childhood injuries from consumer products. The voluntary ASTM standard, she worried, would create confusion for consumers and give new parents a false sense of security about a product that she felt was anything but secure.</p> \n  <p>Nevertheless, ASTM agreed to form a committee to develop a standard for the category. And they appointed Michael Steinwachs\u2014one of the primary engineers at Fisher-Price involved in designing the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper\u2014chairperson of that committee. The voluntary standard for infant inclined sleep products was ultimately established in 2015.</p> \n  <p>Cowles, at KID, was disappointed but not surprised that the product category was established. \u201cYou can talk safety till you\u2019re blue in the face, but if parents will buy them\u2014and [the company] can always justify the incidents that happen as being the parents\u2019 fault\u2014then they\u2019re going to keep selling them,\u201d Cowles said.</p> \n  <h2>Warnings From Around the World</h2> \n  <p>Other health and regulatory agencies were not as easily sold on the infant inclined sleeper, according to documents in the Hidalgo County lawsuit.\u00a0</p> \n  <p>Around January 2011, Australian regulators, for example, wrote to Mattel, explaining why they did not think the item should be marketed as a sleep product. They said that the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper \u201cis at odds with widely accepted and promoted best practices that these types of products should not be used as an infant bedding alternative.\u201d They also explained that because of the product\u2019s angle, \u201cbabies\u2019 heads can easily fall forward in a way that obstructs their airways.\u201d Fisher-Price confirmed it still does not sell the product in Australia.\u00a0</p> \n  <p>In Canada, the product is available\u2014but was reclassified from a \u201csleeper\u201d to a \u201csoother\u201d and is now marketed and sold as the Rock \u2019n Play Soothing Seat. This was because in February 2011 a representative from Health Canada wrote to Mattel Canada stating that public health officials there had concerns about the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper \u201cin light of the Safe Sleep recommendations of Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada, and the Canadian Pediatric Society.\u201d</p> \n  <p>In the United Kingdom, the Rock \u2019n Play is for sale as a \u201csleeper,\u201d despite misgivings from health organizations. In February 2011, the Royal College of Midwives in the U.K. told Fisher-Price that the product was suitable only for short periods of supervised play and that the group would not endorse the product as a sleeper. After receiving that news, a Fisher-Price employee wrote in an internal email, \u201cPlease see attached the findings from the Royal College of Midwives testing on the sleeper. I\u2019m afraid the findings don\u2019t have good implications for a UK launch.\u201d\u00a0</p> \n  <h2>What Parents Should Do</h2> \n  <p>Given the number of injuries and deaths, consumer safety advocates question why neither Mattel nor the CPSC has yet initiated a recall.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIn cases like these, where the product is on the market and there have been incidents associated with it, it\u2019s very difficult to understand why the enforcement agency with jurisdiction over this product wouldn\u2019t take action,\u201d said Rachel Weintraub, legislative director and general counsel of the Consumer Federation of America. \u201cWhen we know there are products that are posing risks and causing fatalities, that product in almost every case needs to be taken off the market.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The alert issued by the CPSC and Fisher-Price is inadequate, said Cowles of KID. She reiterated that children should not sleep restrained, and that children should sleep on flat surfaces, not inclines.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThey should get rid of this product category,\u201d Cowles said. \u201cAnything intended for infant sleep should be flat. And then there should be specific recalls on the products that have been involved in deaths.\u201d</p> \n  <p>CR safety experts agree and recommend that anyone who currently has a Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper should immediately stop using it for routine sleep. Instead, babies should be put to <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/A-Parents-Guide-to-Safe-Sleep.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">bed</a>\u00a0alone, on their backs, on a firm, flat mattress in a crib, bassinet, or play yard.</p>",

These products conflict with American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 safe sleep recommendations, and manufacturers should pull them off the market.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The alert issued Friday by the CPSC and Fisher-Price follows a previous one from the CPSC nearly a year ago, <a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/content/cpsc-consumer-alert-caregivers-urged-to-use-restraints-with-inclined-sleep-products?mod=article_inline\" target=\"_blank\">warning consumers about infant deaths</a>\u00a0associated with inclined sleep products without naming the Fisher-Price Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper.</p> \n  <p>The CPSC told CR in an emailed statement, \u201cAt this time, we are focusing on deaths associated with the rollover hazard, though we acknowledge that we are aware of other deaths that have occurred in the Rock \u2019n Play.\u201d The statement also said that the agency is \u201ccontinuing to evaluate the product and investigate whether it contains a defect \u2026 and if the evidence indicates a need for a recall, we will take that step.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But CR\u2019s investigation\u2014based in part on previously undisclosed CPSC data as well as reviews of lawsuits and interviews with numerous medical experts, product engineers, government and industry officials, and parents\u2014raises questions about how the product was developed and marketed in the first place, and allowed to remain for sale despite incidents dating back many years. It also highlights a larger weakness in the regulatory systems meant to protect consumers, including children, from hazardous products.</p> \n  <h2>A Long List of Deaths</h2> \n  <p>The earliest death that CR uncovered occurred in 2011, with more in the years that followed. There is, for example, the mother in Hidalgo County, Texas, who placed her 2-month old daughter on her back for a night\u2019s sleep on Oct. 19, 2013, according to a lawsuit filed by the family against Fisher-Price. At 4 a.m., when the mother checked, all was well, but by 7 a.m., the baby had stopped breathing. Her head was tilted to the side with her chin on her shoulder, compressing her airway. She was pronounced dead at the scene from positional asphyxia, or an inability to breathe caused by her position.</p> \n  <p>The most recent deaths CR found occurred in spring 2018\u2014one involving a 1-month-old girl in Knoxville, Tenn., and the other a 9-day-old boy in Copperas Cove, Texas.</p> \n  <p>There have also been some close calls. In one, on July 25, 2014, a 7-week-old boy was placed in a Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper while his grandmother was in the room, according to a lawsuit filed against Fisher-Price that was ultimately dismissed.</p> \n  <p>The grandmother, Jan Hinson, of Greenville, S.C., says she looked at her grandson and saw he was \u201ccocked over all the way, and he was blue and lifeless. It was absolutely awful.\u201d She got the infant breathing again, and after a stay in the hospital, he was released.</p> \n  <p>Hinson, who is also a lawyer, is now representing a Virginia couple, Evan and Keenan Overton, whose son died while in a Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper.</p> \n  <p>A few days before Christmas in 2017, 5-month-old Ezra was asleep in the product while Keenan slept on a couch nearby. When Keenan woke in the middle of the night, he found Ezra on his stomach, unresponsive, and yelled for Evan to call 911. \u201cHe was blue, and his body was, it was hard, and he didn\u2019t feel real,\u201d Evan said. Ezra was pronounced dead at the hospital; \u201casphyxia\u201d was listed as the immediate cause of death. (The Overtons say Ezra was buckled in the sleeper, though the death certificate states the baby was unrestrained.)</p> \n  <figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"674\" data-orig-width=\"1199\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en-US/homerun/health.consumerreports.org/914428061489f8e82be00300c62b0434\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b2b1b957e29caecbc21282a07f73f246/tumblr_inline_ppvcuwxOhG1tyob3m_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"674\" data-orig-width=\"1199\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en-US/homerun/health.consumerreports.org/914428061489f8e82be00300c62b0434\"></figure><p>In the days and weeks following the death, as the Overtons tried to make sense of what happened, they looked online and read about the Fisher-Price Rock \u2019n Play. The new parents had trusted that the product was safe for sleeping because that is how it is marketed. On the Fisher-Price website, the product is touted for \u201cnaptime and nighttime,\u201d and the product\u2019s packaging says things such as \u201cInclined sleeper designed for all-night sleep.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But the couple\u2019s internet searches revealed a different story. There were posts from parents and pediatricians describing the product as dangerous, prone to interfering with an infant\u2019s ability to breathe. The Overtons learned that though sudden infant deaths can occur with no clear cause\u2014and there can be many factors involved\u2014experts warned that this particular product, and infant inclined sleep products in general, pose an increased risk of infant death.</p> \n  <p>The Overtons had received their Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper as a hand-me-down from their neighbors, who had said that, when their child was an infant, the product had been a lifesaver. But, Keenan said, the Overtons became convinced that was \u201cthe opposite of what it was.\u201d</p> \n  <p>On Jan. 6, 2018, Evan posted a review on Amazon warning parents about the product: \u201cI lost my son in this horrible contraption December 22 \u2026 this should not be marketed as a sleeper!\u201c</p> \n  <p>When asked by CR about the Overton incident, the company responded, \u201cThe loss of a child is an unimaginable tragedy.\u201d Fisher-Price also confirmed that the Overtons\u2019 case was one of the 10 cited by the company in the joint alert issued with the CPSC on April 5.</p> \n  <h2>History of a Dangerous Product</h2> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.fisher-price.com/en_US/ourstory/rock-n-play-sleeper/index.html\">Fisher-Price</a> says on its website that the company started developing the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper when one of its designers had a baby boy who had trouble sleeping because of acid reflux. The designer\u2019s doctors suggested elevating the infant\u2019s head, prompting her and the company to create a sleeper that would keep her son at a 30-degree incline during sleep.</p> \n  <p>Fisher-Price told CR that it \u201cengaged a leading engineering and scientific consulting firm,\u201d which concluded that the \u201cRock \u2019n Play Sleeper presents a lower risk of fatality than cribs and bassinets/cradles.\u201d<a href=\"https://www.fisher-price.com/en_US/ourstory/rock-n-play-sleeper/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p> \n  <p>Documents filed in an Atlanta lawsuit against Fisher-Price identified a medical consultant hired by the company to be Gary Deegear, M.D., a physician in San Antonio. According to these documents, he offered Fisher-Price assurance about the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper\u2019s safety. For example, Kitty Pilarz\u2014vice president of product safety and regulatory compliance for Mattel\u2014wrote in one email: \u201cDr. Deegear stated pediatricians recommend babies with reflux sleep at 30 degrees, this is just fine, or sleep in a car seat.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But there are several reasons to be concerned about this advice.</p> \n  <p>For one, Deegear is not a pediatrician or a sleep specialist, according to the Texas Medical Board, but was a family practice doctor. CR attempted to contact Deegear but could not reach him for comment.</p> \n  <p>For another, the AAP and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development have long counseled against letting infants sleep unsupervised in a reclined position.</p> \n  <p>Shortly after the recent joint alert from the CPSC and Fisher-Price, the AAP tweeted that \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/healthychildren/status/1114279069120643073\" target=\"_blank\">The Rock \u2019n Play should not be used for routine sleep</a>; If you use the Rock \u2019n Play for soothing, always strap the baby in and never leave the baby unattended.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t recommend that babies are placed to sleep with their heads elevated because that is a position that would be subject to accidental suffocation [and] strangulation in bed,\u201d said Feldman-Winter of the AAP. Instead, the AAP says that for prolonged or nighttime sleep, babies should be put on their backs, unrestrained, alone, on a flat, firm surface, such as a mattress covered by a fitted sheet in a bare crib, bassinet, or play yard.</p> \n  <p>And, experts say, parents should never use a car seat, stroller, swing, sling, wedge, or any other similar product for unsupervised sleep.</p> \n  <p>That recommendation applies even to babies with acid reflux, Feldman-Winter said. She recognizes that some parents have heard that sleeping on an incline can ease that problem and understands the desperation parents can feel when a crying baby can\u2019t sleep. But \u201cthere\u2019s no evidence to suggest that being on an incline is helpful for reflux,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a misconception that that\u2019s somehow an okay, safe sleep position, and it\u2019s just not.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The AAP also doesn\u2019t recommend for routine use sleeping devices that require the use of restraints because a baby could roll or turn into an unsafe position and be incapable of moving, leading to suffocation or strangulation.</p> \n  <p>That\u2019s one of the reasons experts <a href=\"https://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/cribs-are-for-sleeping,-car-seats-are-for-traveling-danger-in-using-sitting-and-carrying-devices-for-sleeping-infants\" target=\"_blank\">caution against using infant car seats for unsupervised sleep</a>. Those products are \u201cacceptable for shorter periods of time because it\u2019s the safest position for a crash,\u201d said Paul Gaudreau, a mechanical engineer who currently works for UPPAbaby and has experience in the car-seat industry. But, he said, <a href=\"https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(15)00345-5/pdf\" target=\"_blank\">research</a>\u00a0(PDF) shows that a <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/Car-Seats-Lower-Oxygen-Levels-of-Newborns.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">baby\u2019s oxygen level can drop</a> when sleeping at an incline in a car seat. And medical experts warn that the straps can lead to strangulation. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve steered companies that I\u2019ve worked for away from doing inclined sleepers.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Finally, the basic advice\u2014that babies should sleep on level, firm surfaces\u2014dates back to 1994, well before Fisher-Price created its Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper. That\u2019s when the AAP and other groups introduced the <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/A-Parents-Guide-to-Safe-Sleep.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cBack to Sleep\u201d campaign</a> to reduce the risk of SIDS and other sleep-related causes of death. That <a href=\"https://safetosleep.nichd.nih.gov/activities/campaign\">campaign</a> (now called \u201c<a href=\"https://safetosleep.nichd.nih.gov/safesleepbasics/about\" target=\"_blank\">Safe to Sleep</a>\u201d) has helped cut the rate of SIDS by almost a half.</p> \n  <p>Roy Benaroch, M.D., an associate adjunct professor of pediatrics at Emory University in Atlanta, who has blogged about the safety risks of the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper, told CR that parents are confused by the product at a time when they are especially vulnerable.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s tough because you don\u2019t sleep, the baby is not sleeping, parents are exhausted, and they\u2019re looking for a solution,\u201d he said. But \u201cparents are assuming a lot of risk by using this rather than following the safety guidelines.\u201d Bottom line: \u201cIf you let your baby sleep in this thing, there\u2019s an increased risk of death,\u201d Benaroch said.</p> \n  <h2>Regulatory Side Steps</h2> \n  <p>When Fisher-Price first introduced the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper, it marketed the product along with its bassinets. But less than a year later, in 2010, the CPSC began revising the standards for infant sleep surfaces, including bassinets, and issued a proposed rule that would require those products to be firm and flat, with an angle of 5 degrees or less when the product was at rest, rather than rocking or swinging.</p> \n  <p>Instead of adjusting the incline of its product, Pilarz, at Mattel, asked the CPSC for a revision to that proposed rule to account for products like the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper. Not making that change, she said, could actually \u201cincrease the risk of injury: Parents deprived of any appropriate product for calming their tired, colicky infants will look elsewhere\u2014and substitute products dangerous for that purpose.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Ultimately, in October 2013, the CPSC excluded products with an incline of greater than 10 degrees from its mandatory bassinet and cradle standards.</p> \n  <p>Armed with that exclusion, Fisher-Price and other industry reps went to ASTM International\u2014an organization that sets voluntary safety standards for consumer products and includes representatives from the government, industry, and the public\u2014to finish a voluntary standard for a new category: inclined infant sleep products.</p> \n  <p>Some ASTM members had objected to creating a new category and standard for those products. \u201cBy putting a standard in, you\u2019re telling people that \u2026 it must be safe,\u201d said Nancy Cowles, executive director of Kids in Danger, a nonprofit that focuses on reducing childhood injuries from consumer products. The voluntary ASTM standard, she worried, would create confusion for consumers and give new parents a false sense of security about a product that she felt was anything but secure.</p> \n  <p>Nevertheless, ASTM agreed to form a committee to develop a standard for the category. And they appointed Michael Steinwachs\u2014one of the primary engineers at Fisher-Price involved in designing the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper\u2014chairperson of that committee. The voluntary standard for infant inclined sleep products was ultimately established in 2015.</p> \n  <p>Cowles, at KID, was disappointed but not surprised that the product category was established. \u201cYou can talk safety till you\u2019re blue in the face, but if parents will buy them\u2014and [the company] can always justify the incidents that happen as being the parents\u2019 fault\u2014then they\u2019re going to keep selling them,\u201d Cowles said.</p> \n  <h2>Warnings From Around the World</h2> \n  <p>Other health and regulatory agencies were not as easily sold on the infant inclined sleeper, according to documents in the Hidalgo County lawsuit.\u00a0</p> \n  <p>Around January 2011, Australian regulators, for example, wrote to Mattel, explaining why they did not think the item should be marketed as a sleep product. They said that the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper \u201cis at odds with widely accepted and promoted best practices that these types of products should not be used as an infant bedding alternative.\u201d They also explained that because of the product\u2019s angle, \u201cbabies\u2019 heads can easily fall forward in a way that obstructs their airways.\u201d Fisher-Price confirmed it still does not sell the product in Australia.\u00a0</p> \n  <p>In Canada, the product is available\u2014but was reclassified from a \u201csleeper\u201d to a \u201csoother\u201d and is now marketed and sold as the Rock \u2019n Play Soothing Seat. This was because in February 2011 a representative from Health Canada wrote to Mattel Canada stating that public health officials there had concerns about the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper \u201cin light of the Safe Sleep recommendations of Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada, and the Canadian Pediatric Society.\u201d</p> \n  <p>In the United Kingdom, the Rock \u2019n Play is for sale as a \u201csleeper,\u201d despite misgivings from health organizations. In February 2011, the Royal College of Midwives in the U.K. told Fisher-Price that the product was suitable only for short periods of supervised play and that the group would not endorse the product as a sleeper. After receiving that news, a Fisher-Price employee wrote in an internal email, \u201cPlease see attached the findings from the Royal College of Midwives testing on the sleeper. I\u2019m afraid the findings don\u2019t have good implications for a UK launch.\u201d\u00a0</p> \n  <h2>What Parents Should Do</h2> \n  <p>Given the number of injuries and deaths, consumer safety advocates question why neither Mattel nor the CPSC has yet initiated a recall.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIn cases like these, where the product is on the market and there have been incidents associated with it, it\u2019s very difficult to understand why the enforcement agency with jurisdiction over this product wouldn\u2019t take action,\u201d said Rachel Weintraub, legislative director and general counsel of the Consumer Federation of America. \u201cWhen we know there are products that are posing risks and causing fatalities, that product in almost every case needs to be taken off the market.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The alert issued by the CPSC and Fisher-Price is inadequate, said Cowles of KID. She reiterated that children should not sleep restrained, and that children should sleep on flat surfaces, not inclines.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThey should get rid of this product category,\u201d Cowles said. \u201cAnything intended for infant sleep should be flat. And then there should be specific recalls on the products that have been involved in deaths.\u201d</p> \n  <p>CR safety experts agree and recommend that anyone who currently has a Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper should immediately stop using it for routine sleep. Instead, babies should be put to <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/A-Parents-Guide-to-Safe-Sleep.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">bed</a>\u00a0alone, on their backs, on a firm, flat mattress in a crib, bassinet, or play yard.</p></p>",

This story was originally published on April 8.</p> \n  <p>A Consumer Reports investigation into the safety of the Fisher-Price Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper\u2014a product designed and marketed for babies to sleep on an incline\u2014found that it is tied to at least 32 infant deaths.</p> \n  <p>Amid CR\u2019s investigation\u2014and days after we asked for comment\u2014the federal government and Fisher-Price on April 5 issued a warning about the product, which safety advocates believe does not go far enough. Medical experts tell CR that babies should be placed flat on their back alone and free of soft bedding\u2014and not at an incline\u2014to minimize the risk of accidental suffocation. Products such as the Fisher-Price Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper do not align with these recommendations.<br></p> \n  <p>The safety alert from the <a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2019/CPSC-ALERT-CPSC-and-Fisher-Price-Warn-Consumers-About-Fisher-Price-Rock-N-Play-Due-to-Reports-of-Death-When-Infants-Roll-Over-in-the-Product\" target=\"_blank\">Consumer Product Safety Commission and Fisher-Price</a> includes a warning from the CPSC for consumers to stop using the product when infants turn 3 months old or \u201cas soon as an infant exhibits rollover capabilities.\u201d The alert cites reports of \u201c10 infant deaths in the Rock \u2019n Play that have occurred since 2015, after the infants rolled from their back to their stomach or side, while unrestrained.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Despite these numbers, the product has not been recalled by Fisher-Price, part of the children\u2019s products giant Mattel, which had about $4.5 billion in sales in 2018. The deaths have prompted only warnings from the company and the CPSC, which does not have a mandatory safety standard for infant inclined sleep products.</p> \n  <p>Fisher-Price told CR in an emailed statement, \u201cThe loss of a child is a devastating tragedy. We will continue to do all we can to ensure that parents and caregivers <a href=\"https://fisher-pricesafety.com/?&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI7IHWhre_4QIVEo_ICh2NWQZoEAAYASAAEgLsWfD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\">have the information necessary</a> to create a safe sleep environment for infants.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But CR\u2019s ongoing investigation has turned up deaths of babies even younger than the 3-month threshold cited in the April 5 warning, and go beyond the risk of rollover.</p> \n  <p>Fisher-Price confirmed to CR that the company is aware of approximately 32 fatalities since the 2009 introduction of the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper, including the 10 noted in the joint release with the CPSC. Fisher-Price told CR that the company does not believe that \u201cany deaths have been caused by the product,\u201d citing \u201cthe many situations where a medical/health condition was identified as the cause of death, and/or those in which the product was clearly used in a manner contrary to the safety warnings and instructions.\u201d</p> \n  <p>While CR\u2019s review of the data shows that certain cases did have contributing factors such as illness or additional bedding, the number of incidents associated with the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper, combined with long-standing expert medical advice that babies should sleep on firm, flat surfaces, raises serious safety concerns about the product.\u00a0</p> \n  <figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"500\" data-orig-width=\"770\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en-US/homerun/health.consumerreports.org/40940568ef8082e17303a97d7e133931\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aeae99502635e6735ade711705fb76e2/tumblr_inline_ppvcuvVydn1tyob3m_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"500\" data-orig-width=\"770\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en-US/homerun/health.consumerreports.org/40940568ef8082e17303a97d7e133931\"></figure><p>Further, the American Academy of Pediatrics says it does not recommend products for routine sleep that require restraining a baby, especially if that product also rocks. \u201cTo [fasten] a baby down to a surface and then rock the baby is not consistent with our recommendations,\u201d said Lori Feldman-Winter, M.D., a member of the AAP task force on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and a professor of pediatrics at Cooper Medical School of Rowan University in Camden, N.J.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBased on the deaths and injuries associated with the Fisher-Price Rock \u2019n Play, the product clearly puts infants\u2019 safety at risk and should be recalled immediately,\u201d says William Wallace, senior policy analyst at CR. \u201cAll other inclined sleepers should be investigated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. These products conflict with American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 safe sleep recommendations, and manufacturers should pull them off the market.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The alert issued Friday by the CPSC and Fisher-Price follows a previous one from the CPSC nearly a year ago, <a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/content/cpsc-consumer-alert-caregivers-urged-to-use-restraints-with-inclined-sleep-products?mod=article_inline\" target=\"_blank\">warning consumers about infant deaths</a>\u00a0associated with inclined sleep products without naming the Fisher-Price Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper.</p> \n  <p>The CPSC told CR in an emailed statement, \u201cAt this time, we are focusing on deaths associated with the rollover hazard, though we acknowledge that we are aware of other deaths that have occurred in the Rock \u2019n Play.\u201d The statement also said that the agency is \u201ccontinuing to evaluate the product and investigate whether it contains a defect \u2026 and if the evidence indicates a need for a recall, we will take that step.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But CR\u2019s investigation\u2014based in part on previously undisclosed CPSC data as well as reviews of lawsuits and interviews with numerous medical experts, product engineers, government and industry officials, and parents\u2014raises questions about how the product was developed and marketed in the first place, and allowed to remain for sale despite incidents dating back many years. It also highlights a larger weakness in the regulatory systems meant to protect consumers, including children, from hazardous products.</p> \n  <h2>A Long List of Deaths</h2> \n  <p>The earliest death that CR uncovered occurred in 2011, with more in the years that followed. There is, for example, the mother in Hidalgo County, Texas, who placed her 2-month old daughter on her back for a night\u2019s sleep on Oct. 19, 2013, according to a lawsuit filed by the family against Fisher-Price. At 4 a.m., when the mother checked, all was well, but by 7 a.m., the baby had stopped breathing. Her head was tilted to the side with her chin on her shoulder, compressing her airway. She was pronounced dead at the scene from positional asphyxia, or an inability to breathe caused by her position.</p> \n  <p>The most recent deaths CR found occurred in spring 2018\u2014one involving a 1-month-old girl in Knoxville, Tenn., and the other a 9-day-old boy in Copperas Cove, Texas.</p> \n  <p>There have also been some close calls. In one, on July 25, 2014, a 7-week-old boy was placed in a Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper while his grandmother was in the room, according to a lawsuit filed against Fisher-Price that was ultimately dismissed.</p> \n  <p>The grandmother, Jan Hinson, of Greenville, S.C., says she looked at her grandson and saw he was \u201ccocked over all the way, and he was blue and lifeless. It was absolutely awful.\u201d She got the infant breathing again, and after a stay in the hospital, he was released.</p> \n  <p>Hinson, who is also a lawyer, is now representing a Virginia couple, Evan and Keenan Overton, whose son died while in a Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper.</p> \n  <p>A few days before Christmas in 2017, 5-month-old Ezra was asleep in the product while Keenan slept on a couch nearby. When Keenan woke in the middle of the night, he found Ezra on his stomach, unresponsive, and yelled for Evan to call 911. \u201cHe was blue, and his body was, it was hard, and he didn\u2019t feel real,\u201d Evan said. Ezra was pronounced dead at the hospital; \u201casphyxia\u201d was listed as the immediate cause of death. (The Overtons say Ezra was buckled in the sleeper, though the death certificate states the baby was unrestrained.)</p> \n  <figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"674\" data-orig-width=\"1199\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en-US/homerun/health.consumerreports.org/914428061489f8e82be00300c62b0434\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b2b1b957e29caecbc21282a07f73f246/tumblr_inline_ppvcuwxOhG1tyob3m_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"674\" data-orig-width=\"1199\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en-US/homerun/health.consumerreports.org/914428061489f8e82be00300c62b0434\"></figure><p>In the days and weeks following the death, as the Overtons tried to make sense of what happened, they looked online and read about the Fisher-Price Rock \u2019n Play. The new parents had trusted that the product was safe for sleeping because that is how it is marketed. On the Fisher-Price website, the product is touted for \u201cnaptime and nighttime,\u201d and the product\u2019s packaging says things such as \u201cInclined sleeper designed for all-night sleep.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But the couple\u2019s internet searches revealed a different story. There were posts from parents and pediatricians describing the product as dangerous, prone to interfering with an infant\u2019s ability to breathe. The Overtons learned that though sudden infant deaths can occur with no clear cause\u2014and there can be many factors involved\u2014experts warned that this particular product, and infant inclined sleep products in general, pose an increased risk of infant death.</p> \n  <p>The Overtons had received their Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper as a hand-me-down from their neighbors, who had said that, when their child was an infant, the product had been a lifesaver. But, Keenan said, the Overtons became convinced that was \u201cthe opposite of what it was.\u201d</p> \n  <p>On Jan. 6, 2018, Evan posted a review on Amazon warning parents about the product: \u201cI lost my son in this horrible contraption December 22 \u2026 this should not be marketed as a sleeper!\u201c</p> \n  <p>When asked by CR about the Overton incident, the company responded, \u201cThe loss of a child is an unimaginable tragedy.\u201d Fisher-Price also confirmed that the Overtons\u2019 case was one of the 10 cited by the company in the joint alert issued with the CPSC on April 5.</p> \n  <h2>History of a Dangerous Product</h2> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.fisher-price.com/en_US/ourstory/rock-n-play-sleeper/index.html\">Fisher-Price</a> says on its website that the company started developing the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper when one of its designers had a baby boy who had trouble sleeping because of acid reflux. The designer\u2019s doctors suggested elevating the infant\u2019s head, prompting her and the company to create a sleeper that would keep her son at a 30-degree incline during sleep.</p> \n  <p>Fisher-Price told CR that it \u201cengaged a leading engineering and scientific consulting firm,\u201d which concluded that the \u201cRock \u2019n Play Sleeper presents a lower risk of fatality than cribs and bassinets/cradles.\u201d<a href=\"https://www.fisher-price.com/en_US/ourstory/rock-n-play-sleeper/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p> \n  <p>Documents filed in an Atlanta lawsuit against Fisher-Price identified a medical consultant hired by the company to be Gary Deegear, M.D., a physician in San Antonio. According to these documents, he offered Fisher-Price assurance about the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper\u2019s safety. For example, Kitty Pilarz\u2014vice president of product safety and regulatory compliance for Mattel\u2014wrote in one email: \u201cDr. Deegear stated pediatricians recommend babies with reflux sleep at 30 degrees, this is just fine, or sleep in a car seat.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But there are several reasons to be concerned about this advice.</p> \n  <p>For one, Deegear is not a pediatrician or a sleep specialist, according to the Texas Medical Board, but was a family practice doctor. CR attempted to contact Deegear but could not reach him for comment.</p> \n  <p>For another, the AAP and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development have long counseled against letting infants sleep unsupervised in a reclined position.</p> \n  <p>Shortly after the recent joint alert from the CPSC and Fisher-Price, the AAP tweeted that \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/healthychildren/status/1114279069120643073\" target=\"_blank\">The Rock \u2019n Play should not be used for routine sleep</a>; If you use the Rock \u2019n Play for soothing, always strap the baby in and never leave the baby unattended.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t recommend that babies are placed to sleep with their heads elevated because that is a position that would be subject to accidental suffocation [and] strangulation in bed,\u201d said Feldman-Winter of the AAP. Instead, the AAP says that for prolonged or nighttime sleep, babies should be put on their backs, unrestrained, alone, on a flat, firm surface, such as a mattress covered by a fitted sheet in a bare crib, bassinet, or play yard.</p> \n  <p>And, experts say, parents should never use a car seat, stroller, swing, sling, wedge, or any other similar product for unsupervised sleep.</p> \n  <p>That recommendation applies even to babies with acid reflux, Feldman-Winter said. She recognizes that some parents have heard that sleeping on an incline can ease that problem and understands the desperation parents can feel when a crying baby can\u2019t sleep. But \u201cthere\u2019s no evidence to suggest that being on an incline is helpful for reflux,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a misconception that that\u2019s somehow an okay, safe sleep position, and it\u2019s just not.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The AAP also doesn\u2019t recommend for routine use sleeping devices that require the use of restraints because a baby could roll or turn into an unsafe position and be incapable of moving, leading to suffocation or strangulation.</p> \n  <p>That\u2019s one of the reasons experts <a href=\"https://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/cribs-are-for-sleeping,-car-seats-are-for-traveling-danger-in-using-sitting-and-carrying-devices-for-sleeping-infants\" target=\"_blank\">caution against using infant car seats for unsupervised sleep</a>. Those products are \u201cacceptable for shorter periods of time because it\u2019s the safest position for a crash,\u201d said Paul Gaudreau, a mechanical engineer who currently works for UPPAbaby and has experience in the car-seat industry. But, he said, <a href=\"https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(15)00345-5/pdf\" target=\"_blank\">research</a>\u00a0(PDF) shows that a <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/Car-Seats-Lower-Oxygen-Levels-of-Newborns.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">baby\u2019s oxygen level can drop</a> when sleeping at an incline in a car seat. And medical experts warn that the straps can lead to strangulation. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve steered companies that I\u2019ve worked for away from doing inclined sleepers.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Finally, the basic advice\u2014that babies should sleep on level, firm surfaces\u2014dates back to 1994, well before Fisher-Price created its Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper. That\u2019s when the AAP and other groups introduced the <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/A-Parents-Guide-to-Safe-Sleep.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cBack to Sleep\u201d campaign</a> to reduce the risk of SIDS and other sleep-related causes of death. That <a href=\"https://safetosleep.nichd.nih.gov/activities/campaign\">campaign</a> (now called \u201c<a href=\"https://safetosleep.nichd.nih.gov/safesleepbasics/about\" target=\"_blank\">Safe to Sleep</a>\u201d) has helped cut the rate of SIDS by almost a half.</p> \n  <p>Roy Benaroch, M.D., an associate adjunct professor of pediatrics at Emory University in Atlanta, who has blogged about the safety risks of the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper, told CR that parents are confused by the product at a time when they are especially vulnerable.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s tough because you don\u2019t sleep, the baby is not sleeping, parents are exhausted, and they\u2019re looking for a solution,\u201d he said. But \u201cparents are assuming a lot of risk by using this rather than following the safety guidelines.\u201d Bottom line: \u201cIf you let your baby sleep in this thing, there\u2019s an increased risk of death,\u201d Benaroch said.</p> \n  <h2>Regulatory Side Steps</h2> \n  <p>When Fisher-Price first introduced the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper, it marketed the product along with its bassinets. But less than a year later, in 2010, the CPSC began revising the standards for infant sleep surfaces, including bassinets, and issued a proposed rule that would require those products to be firm and flat, with an angle of 5 degrees or less when the product was at rest, rather than rocking or swinging.</p> \n  <p>Instead of adjusting the incline of its product, Pilarz, at Mattel, asked the CPSC for a revision to that proposed rule to account for products like the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper. Not making that change, she said, could actually \u201cincrease the risk of injury: Parents deprived of any appropriate product for calming their tired, colicky infants will look elsewhere\u2014and substitute products dangerous for that purpose.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Ultimately, in October 2013, the CPSC excluded products with an incline of greater than 10 degrees from its mandatory bassinet and cradle standards.</p> \n  <p>Armed with that exclusion, Fisher-Price and other industry reps went to ASTM International\u2014an organization that sets voluntary safety standards for consumer products and includes representatives from the government, industry, and the public\u2014to finish a voluntary standard for a new category: inclined infant sleep products.</p> \n  <p>Some ASTM members had objected to creating a new category and standard for those products. \u201cBy putting a standard in, you\u2019re telling people that \u2026 it must be safe,\u201d said Nancy Cowles, executive director of Kids in Danger, a nonprofit that focuses on reducing childhood injuries from consumer products. The voluntary ASTM standard, she worried, would create confusion for consumers and give new parents a false sense of security about a product that she felt was anything but secure.</p> \n  <p>Nevertheless, ASTM agreed to form a committee to develop a standard for the category. And they appointed Michael Steinwachs\u2014one of the primary engineers at Fisher-Price involved in designing the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper\u2014chairperson of that committee. The voluntary standard for infant inclined sleep products was ultimately established in 2015.</p> \n  <p>Cowles, at KID, was disappointed but not surprised that the product category was established. \u201cYou can talk safety till you\u2019re blue in the face, but if parents will buy them\u2014and [the company] can always justify the incidents that happen as being the parents\u2019 fault\u2014then they\u2019re going to keep selling them,\u201d Cowles said.</p> \n  <h2>Warnings From Around the World</h2> \n  <p>Other health and regulatory agencies were not as easily sold on the infant inclined sleeper, according to documents in the Hidalgo County lawsuit.\u00a0</p> \n  <p>Around January 2011, Australian regulators, for example, wrote to Mattel, explaining why they did not think the item should be marketed as a sleep product. They said that the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper \u201cis at odds with widely accepted and promoted best practices that these types of products should not be used as an infant bedding alternative.\u201d They also explained that because of the product\u2019s angle, \u201cbabies\u2019 heads can easily fall forward in a way that obstructs their airways.\u201d Fisher-Price confirmed it still does not sell the product in Australia.\u00a0</p> \n  <p>In Canada, the product is available\u2014but was reclassified from a \u201csleeper\u201d to a \u201csoother\u201d and is now marketed and sold as the Rock \u2019n Play Soothing Seat. This was because in February 2011 a representative from Health Canada wrote to Mattel Canada stating that public health officials there had concerns about the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper \u201cin light of the Safe Sleep recommendations of Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada, and the Canadian Pediatric Society.\u201d</p> \n  <p>In the United Kingdom, the Rock \u2019n Play is for sale as a \u201csleeper,\u201d despite misgivings from health organizations. In February 2011, the Royal College of Midwives in the U.K. told Fisher-Price that the product was suitable only for short periods of supervised play and that the group would not endorse the product as a sleeper. After receiving that news, a Fisher-Price employee wrote in an internal email, \u201cPlease see attached the findings from the Royal College of Midwives testing on the sleeper. I\u2019m afraid the findings don\u2019t have good implications for a UK launch.\u201d\u00a0</p> \n  <h2>What Parents Should Do</h2> \n  <p>Given the number of injuries and deaths, consumer safety advocates question why neither Mattel nor the CPSC has yet initiated a recall.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIn cases like these, where the product is on the market and there have been incidents associated with it, it\u2019s very difficult to understand why the enforcement agency with jurisdiction over this product wouldn\u2019t take action,\u201d said Rachel Weintraub, legislative director and general counsel of the Consumer Federation of America. \u201cWhen we know there are products that are posing risks and causing fatalities, that product in almost every case needs to be taken off the market.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The alert issued by the CPSC and Fisher-Price is inadequate, said Cowles of KID. She reiterated that children should not sleep restrained, and that children should sleep on flat surfaces, not inclines.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThey should get rid of this product category,\u201d Cowles said. \u201cAnything intended for infant sleep should be flat. And then there should be specific recalls on the products that have been involved in deaths.\u201d</p> \n  <p>CR safety experts agree and recommend that anyone who currently has a Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper should immediately stop using it for routine sleep. Instead, babies should be put to <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/A-Parents-Guide-to-Safe-Sleep.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">bed</a>\u00a0alone, on their backs, on a firm, flat mattress in a crib, bassinet, or play yard.</p></p>",

This story was originally published on April 8.</p> \n  <p>A Consumer Reports investigation into the safety of the Fisher-Price Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper&mdash;a product designed and marketed for babies to sleep on an incline&mdash;found that it is tied to at least 32 infant deaths.</p> \n  <p>Amid CR&rsquo;s investigation&mdash;and days after we asked for comment&mdash;the federal government and Fisher-Price on April 5 issued a warning about the product, which safety advocates believe does not go far enough.

Products such as the Fisher-Price Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper do not align with these recommendations.<br /></p> \n  <p>The safety alert from the <a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2019/CPSC-ALERT-CPSC-and-Fisher-Price-Warn-Consumers-About-Fisher-Price-Rock-N-Play-Due-to-Reports-of-Death-When-Infants-Roll-Over-in-the-Product\" target=\"_blank\">Consumer Product Safety Commission and Fisher-Price</a> includes a warning from the CPSC for consumers to stop using the product when infants turn 3 months old or &ldquo;as soon as an infant exhibits rollover capabilities.&rdquo; The alert cites reports of &ldquo;10 infant deaths in the Rock &rsquo;n Play that have occurred since 2015, after the infants rolled from their back to their stomach or side, while unrestrained.&rdquo;</p> \n  <p>Despite these numbers, the product has not been recalled by Fisher-Price, part of the children&rsquo;s products giant Mattel, which had about $4.5 billion in sales in 2018. The deaths have prompted only warnings from the company and the CPSC, which does not have a mandatory safety standard for infant inclined sleep products.</p> \n  <p>Fisher-Price told CR in an emailed statement, &ldquo;The loss of a child is a devastating tragedy. We will continue to do all we can to ensure that parents and caregivers <a href=\"https://fisher-pricesafety.com/?&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI7IHWhre_4QIVEo_ICh2NWQZoEAAYASAAEgLsWfD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\">have the information necessary</a> to create a safe sleep environment for infants.&rdquo;</p> \n  <p>But CR&rsquo;s ongoing investigation has turned up deaths of babies even younger than the 3-month threshold cited in the April 5 warning, and go beyond the risk of rollover.</p> \n  <p>Fisher-Price confirmed to CR that the company is aware of approximately 32 fatalities since the 2009 introduction of the Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper, including the 10 noted in the joint release with the CPSC. Fisher-Price told CR that the company does not believe that &ldquo;any deaths have been caused by the product,&rdquo; citing &ldquo;the many situations where a medical/health condition was identified as the cause of death, and/or those in which the product was clearly used in a manner contrary to the safety warnings and instructions.&rdquo;</p> \n  <p>While CR&rsquo;s review of the data shows that certain cases did have contributing factors such as illness or additional bedding, the number of incidents associated with the Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper, combined with long-standing expert medical advice that babies should sleep on firm, flat surfaces, raises serious safety concerns about the product.&nbsp;</p> \n  <figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aeae99502635e6735ade711705fb76e2/tumblr_inline_ppvcuvVydn1tyob3m_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Further, the American Academy of Pediatrics says it does not recommend products for routine sleep that require restraining a baby, especially if that product also rocks. &ldquo;To [fasten] a baby down to a surface and then rock the baby is not consistent with our recommendations,&rdquo; said Lori Feldman-Winter, M.D., a member of the AAP task force on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and a professor of pediatrics at Cooper Medical School of Rowan University in Camden, N.J.</p> \n  <p>&ldquo;Based on the deaths and injuries associated with the Fisher-Price Rock &rsquo;n Play, the product clearly puts infants&rsquo; safety at risk and should be recalled immediately,&rdquo; says William Wallace, senior policy analyst at CR. &ldquo;All other inclined sleepers should be investigated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. These products conflict with American Academy of Pediatrics&rsquo; safe sleep recommendations, and manufacturers should pull them off the market.&rdquo;</p> \n  <p>The alert issued Friday by the CPSC and Fisher-Price follows a previous one from the CPSC nearly a year ago, <a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/content/cpsc-consumer-alert-caregivers-urged-to-use-restraints-with-inclined-sleep-products?mod=article_inline\" target=\"_blank\">warning consumers about infant deaths</a>&nbsp;associated with inclined sleep products without naming the Fisher-Price Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper.</p> \n  <p>The CPSC told CR in an emailed statement, &ldquo;At this time, we are focusing on deaths associated with the rollover hazard, though we acknowledge that we are aware of other deaths that have occurred in the Rock &rsquo;n Play.&rdquo; The statement also said that the agency is &ldquo;continuing to evaluate the product and investigate whether it contains a defect &hellip; and if the evidence indicates a need for a recall, we will take that step.&rdquo;</p> \n  <p>But CR&rsquo;s investigation&mdash;based in part on previously undisclosed CPSC data as well as reviews of lawsuits and interviews with numerous medical experts, product engineers, government and industry officials, and parents&mdash;raises questions about how the product was developed and marketed in the first place, and allowed to remain for sale despite incidents dating back many years. It also highlights a larger weakness in the regulatory systems meant to protect consumers, including children, from hazardous products.</p> \n  <h2>A Long List of Deaths</h2> \n  <p>The earliest death that CR uncovered occurred in 2011, with more in the years that followed. There is, for example, the mother in Hidalgo County, Texas, who placed her 2-month old daughter on her back for a night&rsquo;s sleep on Oct. 19, 2013, according to a lawsuit filed by the family against Fisher-Price. At 4 a.m., when the mother checked, all was well, but by 7 a.m., the baby had stopped breathing. Her head was tilted to the side with her chin on her shoulder, compressing her airway. She was pronounced dead at the scene from positional asphyxia, or an inability to breathe caused by her position.</p> \n  <p>The most recent deaths CR found occurred in spring 2018&mdash;one involving a 1-month-old girl in Knoxville, Tenn., and the other a 9-day-old boy in Copperas Cove, Texas.</p> \n  <p>There have also been some close calls. In one, on July 25, 2014, a 7-week-old boy was placed in a Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper while his grandmother was in the room, according to a lawsuit filed against Fisher-Price that was ultimately dismissed.</p> \n  <p>The grandmother, Jan Hinson, of Greenville, S.C., says she looked at her grandson and saw he was &ldquo;cocked over all the way, and he was blue and lifeless. It was absolutely awful.&rdquo; She got the infant breathing again, and after a stay in the hospital, he was released.</p> \n  <p>Hinson, who is also a lawyer, is now representing a Virginia couple, Evan and Keenan Overton, whose son died while in a Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper.</p> \n  <p>A few days before Christmas in 2017, 5-month-old Ezra was asleep in the product while Keenan slept on a couch nearby. When Keenan woke in the middle of the night, he found Ezra on his stomach, unresponsive, and yelled for Evan to call 911. &ldquo;He was blue, and his body was, it was hard, and he didn&rsquo;t feel real,&rdquo; Evan said. Ezra was pronounced dead at the hospital; &ldquo;asphyxia&rdquo; was listed as the immediate cause of death. (The Overtons say Ezra was buckled in the sleeper, though the death certificate states the baby was unrestrained.)</p> \n  <figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b2b1b957e29caecbc21282a07f73f246/tumblr_inline_ppvcuwxOhG1tyob3m_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>In the days and weeks following the death, as the Overtons tried to make sense of what happened, they looked online and read about the Fisher-Price Rock &rsquo;n Play. The new parents had trusted that the product was safe for sleeping because that is how it is marketed. On the Fisher-Price website, the product is touted for &ldquo;naptime and nighttime,&rdquo; and the product&rsquo;s packaging says things such as &ldquo;Inclined sleeper designed for all-night sleep.&rdquo;</p> \n  <p>But the couple&rsquo;s internet searches revealed a different story. There were posts from parents and pediatricians describing the product as dangerous, prone to interfering with an infant&rsquo;s ability to breathe. The Overtons learned that though sudden infant deaths can occur with no clear cause&mdash;and there can be many factors involved&mdash;experts warned that this particular product, and infant inclined sleep products in general, pose an increased risk of infant death.</p> \n  <p>The Overtons had received their Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper as a hand-me-down from their neighbors, who had said that, when their child was an infant, the product had been a lifesaver. But, Keenan said, the Overtons became convinced that was &ldquo;the opposite of what it was.&rdquo;</p> \n  <p>On Jan. 6, 2018, Evan posted a review on Amazon warning parents about the product: &ldquo;I lost my son in this horrible contraption December 22 &hellip; this should not be marketed as a sleeper!&ldquo;</p> \n  <p>When asked by CR about the Overton incident, the company responded, &ldquo;The loss of a child is an unimaginable tragedy.&rdquo; Fisher-Price also confirmed that the Overtons&rsquo; case was one of the 10 cited by the company in the joint alert issued with the CPSC on April 5.</p> \n  <h2>History of a Dangerous Product</h2> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.fisher-price.com/en_US/ourstory/rock-n-play-sleeper/index.html\">Fisher-Price</a> says on its website that the company started developing the Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper when one of its designers had a baby boy who had trouble sleeping because of acid reflux. The designer&rsquo;s doctors suggested elevating the infant&rsquo;s head, prompting her and the company to create a sleeper that would keep her son at a 30-degree incline during sleep.</p> \n  <p>Fisher-Price told CR that it &ldquo;engaged a leading engineering and scientific consulting firm,&rdquo; which concluded that the &ldquo;Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper presents a lower risk of fatality than cribs and bassinets/cradles.&rdquo;<a href=\"https://www.fisher-price.com/en_US/ourstory/rock-n-play-sleeper/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p> \n  <p>Documents filed in an Atlanta lawsuit against Fisher-Price identified a medical consultant hired by the company to be Gary Deegear, M.D., a physician in San Antonio. According to these documents, he offered Fisher-Price assurance about the Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper&rsquo;s safety. For example, Kitty Pilarz&mdash;vice president of product safety and regulatory compliance for Mattel&mdash;wrote in one email: &ldquo;Dr. Deegear stated pediatricians recommend babies with reflux sleep at 30 degrees, this is just fine, or sleep in a car seat.&rdquo;</p> \n  <p>But there are several reasons to be concerned about this advice.</p> \n  <p>For one, Deegear is not a pediatrician or a sleep specialist, according to the Texas Medical Board, but was a family practice doctor. CR attempted to contact Deegear but could not reach him for comment.</p> \n  <p>For another, the AAP and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development have long counseled against letting infants sleep unsupervised in a reclined position.</p> \n  <p>Shortly after the recent joint alert from the CPSC and Fisher-Price, the AAP tweeted that &ldquo;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/healthychildren/status/1114279069120643073\" target=\"_blank\">The Rock &rsquo;n Play should not be used for routine sleep</a>; If you use the Rock &rsquo;n Play for soothing, always strap the baby in and never leave the baby unattended.&rdquo;</p> \n  <p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t recommend that babies are placed to sleep with their heads elevated because that is a position that would be subject to accidental suffocation [and] strangulation in bed,&rdquo; said Feldman-Winter of the AAP. Instead, the AAP says that for prolonged or nighttime sleep, babies should be put on their backs, unrestrained, alone, on a flat, firm surface, such as a mattress covered by a fitted sheet in a bare crib, bassinet, or play yard.</p> \n  <p>And, experts say, parents should never use a car seat, stroller, swing, sling, wedge, or any other similar product for unsupervised sleep.</p> \n  <p>That recommendation applies even to babies with acid reflux, Feldman-Winter said. She recognizes that some parents have heard that sleeping on an incline can ease that problem and understands the desperation parents can feel when a crying baby can&rsquo;t sleep. But &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no evidence to suggest that being on an incline is helpful for reflux,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There is a misconception that that&rsquo;s somehow an okay, safe sleep position, and it&rsquo;s just not.&rdquo;</p> \n  <p>The AAP also doesn&rsquo;t recommend for routine use sleeping devices that require the use of restraints because a baby could roll or turn into an unsafe position and be incapable of moving, leading to suffocation or strangulation.</p> \n  <p>That&rsquo;s one of the reasons experts <a href=\"https://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/cribs-are-for-sleeping,-car-seats-are-for-traveling-danger-in-using-sitting-and-carrying-devices-for-sleeping-infants\" target=\"_blank\">caution against using infant car seats for unsupervised sleep</a>. Those products are &ldquo;acceptable for shorter periods of time because it&rsquo;s the safest position for a crash,&rdquo; said Paul Gaudreau, a mechanical engineer who currently works for UPPAbaby and has experience in the car-seat industry. But, he said, <a href=\"https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(15)00345-5/pdf\" target=\"_blank\">research</a>&nbsp;(PDF) shows that a <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/Car-Seats-Lower-Oxygen-Levels-of-Newborns.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">baby&rsquo;s oxygen level can drop</a> when sleeping at an incline in a car seat. And medical experts warn that the straps can lead to strangulation. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve steered companies that I&rsquo;ve worked for away from doing inclined sleepers.&rdquo;</p> \n  <p>Finally, the basic advice&mdash;that babies should sleep on level, firm surfaces&mdash;dates back to 1994, well before Fisher-Price created its Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper. That&rsquo;s when the AAP and other groups introduced the <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/A-Parents-Guide-to-Safe-Sleep.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;Back to Sleep&rdquo; campaign</a> to reduce the risk of SIDS and other sleep-related causes of death. That <a href=\"https://safetosleep.nichd.nih.gov/activities/campaign\">campaign</a> (now called &ldquo;<a href=\"https://safetosleep.nichd.nih.gov/safesleepbasics/about\" target=\"_blank\">Safe to Sleep</a>&rdquo;) has helped cut the rate of SIDS by almost a half.</p> \n  <p>Roy Benaroch, M.D., an associate adjunct professor of pediatrics at Emory University in Atlanta, who has blogged about the safety risks of the Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper, told CR that parents are confused by the product at a time when they are especially vulnerable.</p> \n  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s tough because you don&rsquo;t sleep, the baby is not sleeping, parents are exhausted, and they&rsquo;re looking for a solution,&rdquo; he said. But &ldquo;parents are assuming a lot of risk by using this rather than following the safety guidelines.&rdquo; Bottom line: &ldquo;If you let your baby sleep in this thing, there&rsquo;s an increased risk of death,&rdquo; Benaroch said.</p> \n  <h2>Regulatory Side Steps</h2> \n  <p>When Fisher-Price first introduced the Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper, it marketed the product along with its bassinets. But less than a year later, in 2010, the CPSC began revising the standards for infant sleep surfaces, including bassinets, and issued a proposed rule that would require those products to be firm and flat, with an angle of 5 degrees or less when the product was at rest, rather than rocking or swinging.</p> \n  <p>Instead of adjusting the incline of its product, Pilarz, at Mattel, asked the CPSC for a revision to that proposed rule to account for products like the Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper. Not making that change, she said, could actually &ldquo;increase the risk of injury: Parents deprived of any appropriate product for calming their tired, colicky infants will look elsewhere&mdash;and substitute products dangerous for that purpose.&rdquo;</p> \n  <p>Ultimately, in October 2013, the CPSC excluded products with an incline of greater than 10 degrees from its mandatory bassinet and cradle standards.</p> \n  <p>Armed with that exclusion, Fisher-Price and other industry reps went to ASTM International&mdash;an organization that sets voluntary safety standards for consumer products and includes representatives from the government, industry, and the public&mdash;to finish a voluntary standard for a new category: inclined infant sleep products.</p> \n  <p>Some ASTM members had objected to creating a new category and standard for those products. &ldquo;By putting a standard in, you&rsquo;re telling people that &hellip; it must be safe,&rdquo; said Nancy Cowles, executive director of Kids in Danger, a nonprofit that focuses on reducing childhood injuries from consumer products. The voluntary ASTM standard, she worried, would create confusion for consumers and give new parents a false sense of security about a product that she felt was anything but secure.</p> \n  <p>Nevertheless, ASTM agreed to form a committee to develop a standard for the category. And they appointed Michael Steinwachs&mdash;one of the primary engineers at Fisher-Price involved in designing the Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper&mdash;chairperson of that committee. The voluntary standard for infant inclined sleep products was ultimately established in 2015.</p> \n  <p>Cowles, at KID, was disappointed but not surprised that the product category was established. &ldquo;You can talk safety till you&rsquo;re blue in the face, but if parents will buy them&mdash;and [the company] can always justify the incidents that happen as being the parents&rsquo; fault&mdash;then they&rsquo;re going to keep selling them,&rdquo; Cowles said.</p> \n  <h2>Warnings From Around the World</h2> \n  <p>Other health and regulatory agencies were not as easily sold on the infant inclined sleeper, according to documents in the Hidalgo County lawsuit.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>Around January 2011, Australian regulators, for example, wrote to Mattel, explaining why they did not think the item should be marketed as a sleep product. They said that the Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper &ldquo;is at odds with widely accepted and promoted best practices that these types of products should not be used as an infant bedding alternative.&rdquo; They also explained that because of the product&rsquo;s angle, &ldquo;babies&rsquo; heads can easily fall forward in a way that obstructs their airways.&rdquo; Fisher-Price confirmed it still does not sell the product in Australia.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>In Canada, the product is available&mdash;but was reclassified from a &ldquo;sleeper&rdquo; to a &ldquo;soother&rdquo; and is now marketed and sold as the Rock &rsquo;n Play Soothing Seat. This was because in February 2011 a representative from Health Canada wrote to Mattel Canada stating that public health officials there had concerns about the Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper &ldquo;in light of the Safe Sleep recommendations of Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada, and the Canadian Pediatric Society.&rdquo;</p> \n  <p>In the United Kingdom, the Rock &rsquo;n Play is for sale as a &ldquo;sleeper,&rdquo; despite misgivings from health organizations. In February 2011, the Royal College of Midwives in the U.K. told Fisher-Price that the product was suitable only for short periods of supervised play and that the group would not endorse the product as a sleeper. After receiving that news, a Fisher-Price employee wrote in an internal email, &ldquo;Please see attached the findings from the Royal College of Midwives testing on the sleeper. I&rsquo;m afraid the findings don&rsquo;t have good implications for a UK launch.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> \n  <h2>What Parents Should Do</h2> \n  <p>Given the number of injuries and deaths, consumer safety advocates question why neither Mattel nor the CPSC has yet initiated a recall.</p> \n  <p>&ldquo;In cases like these, where the product is on the market and there have been incidents associated with it, it&rsquo;s very difficult to understand why the enforcement agency with jurisdiction over this product wouldn&rsquo;t take action,&rdquo; said Rachel Weintraub, legislative director and general counsel of the Consumer Federation of America. &ldquo;When we know there are products that are posing risks and causing fatalities, that product in almost every case needs to be taken off the market.&rdquo;</p> \n  <p>The alert issued by the CPSC and Fisher-Price is inadequate, said Cowles of KID. She reiterated that children should not sleep restrained, and that children should sleep on flat surfaces, not inclines.</p> \n  <p>&ldquo;They should get rid of this product category,&rdquo; Cowles said. &ldquo;Anything intended for infant sleep should be flat. And then there should be specific recalls on the products that have been involved in deaths.&rdquo;</p> \n  <p>CR safety experts agree and recommend that anyone who currently has a Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper should immediately stop using it for routine sleep. Instead, babies should be put to <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/A-Parents-Guide-to-Safe-Sleep.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">bed</a>&nbsp;alone, on their backs, on a firm, flat mattress in a crib, bassinet, or play yard.</p>",

Fisher-Price told CR that the company does not believe that \u201cany deaths have been caused by the product,\u201d citing \u201cthe many situations where a medical/health condition was identified as the cause of death, and/or those in which the product was clearly used in a manner contrary to the safety warnings and instructions.\u201d</p> \n  <p>While CR\u2019s review of the data shows that certain cases did have contributing factors such as illness or additional bedding, the number of incidents associated with the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper, combined with long-standing expert medical advice that babies should sleep on firm, flat surfaces, raises serious safety concerns about the product.\u00a0</p> \n  <figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"500\" data-orig-width=\"770\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en-US/homerun/consumer_reports_689/40940568ef8082e17303a97d7e133931\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aeae99502635e6735ade711705fb76e2/tumblr_inline_ppvcuw3m4v1thnhmz_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"500\" data-orig-width=\"770\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en-US/homerun/consumer_reports_689/40940568ef8082e17303a97d7e133931\"/></figure><p>Further, the American Academy of Pediatrics says it does not recommend products for routine sleep that require restraining a baby, especially if that product also rocks. \u201cTo [fasten] a baby down to a surface and then rock the baby is not consistent with our recommendations,\u201d said Lori Feldman-Winter, M.D., a member of the AAP task force on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and a professor of pediatrics at Cooper Medical School of Rowan University in Camden, N.J.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBased on the deaths and injuries associated with the Fisher-Price Rock \u2019n Play, the product clearly puts infants\u2019 safety at risk and should be recalled immediately,\u201d says William Wallace, senior policy analyst at CR. \u201cAll other inclined sleepers should be investigated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. These products conflict with American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 safe sleep recommendations, and manufacturers should pull them off the market.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The alert issued Friday by the CPSC and Fisher-Price follows a previous one from the CPSC nearly a year ago, <a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/content/cpsc-consumer-alert-caregivers-urged-to-use-restraints-with-inclined-sleep-products?mod=article_inline\" target=\"_blank\">warning consumers about infant deaths</a>\u00a0associated with inclined sleep products without naming the Fisher-Price Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper.</p> \n  <p>The CPSC told CR in an emailed statement, \u201cAt this time, we are focusing on deaths associated with the rollover hazard, though we acknowledge that we are aware of other deaths that have occurred in the Rock \u2019n Play.\u201d The statement also said that the agency is \u201ccontinuing to evaluate the product and investigate whether it contains a defect &hellip; and if the evidence indicates a need for a recall, we will take that step.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But CR\u2019s investigation\u2014based in part on previously undisclosed CPSC data as well as reviews of lawsuits and interviews with numerous medical experts, product engineers, government and industry officials, and parents\u2014raises questions about how the product was developed and marketed in the first place, and allowed to remain for sale despite incidents dating back many years. It also highlights a larger weakness in the regulatory systems meant to protect consumers, including children, from hazardous products.</p> \n  <h2>A Long List of Deaths</h2> \n  <p>The earliest death that CR uncovered occurred in 2011, with more in the years that followed. There is, for example, the mother in Hidalgo County, Texas, who placed her 2-month old daughter on her back for a night\u2019s sleep on Oct. 19, 2013, according to a lawsuit filed by the family against Fisher-Price. At 4 a.m., when the mother checked, all was well, but by 7 a.m., the baby had stopped breathing. Her head was tilted to the side with her chin on her shoulder, compressing her airway. She was pronounced dead at the scene from positional asphyxia, or an inability to breathe caused by her position.</p> \n  <p>The most recent deaths CR found occurred in spring 2018\u2014one involving a 1-month-old girl in Knoxville, Tenn., and the other a 9-day-old boy in Copperas Cove, Texas.</p> \n  <p>There have also been some close calls. In one, on July 25, 2014, a 7-week-old boy was placed in a Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper while his grandmother was in the room, according to a lawsuit filed against Fisher-Price that was ultimately dismissed.</p> \n  <p>The grandmother, Jan Hinson, of Greenville, S.C., says she looked at her grandson and saw he was \u201ccocked over all the way, and he was blue and lifeless. It was absolutely awful.\u201d She got the infant breathing again, and after a stay in the hospital, he was released.</p> \n  <p>Hinson, who is also a lawyer, is now representing a Virginia couple, Evan and Keenan Overton, whose son died while in a Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper.</p> \n  <p>A few days before Christmas in 2017, 5-month-old Ezra was asleep in the product while Keenan slept on a couch nearby. When Keenan woke in the middle of the night, he found Ezra on his stomach, unresponsive, and yelled for Evan to call 911. \u201cHe was blue, and his body was, it was hard, and he didn\u2019t feel real,\u201d Evan said. Ezra was pronounced dead at the hospital; \u201casphyxia\u201d was listed as the immediate cause of death. (The Overtons say Ezra was buckled in the sleeper, though the death certificate states the baby was unrestrained.)</p> \n  <figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"674\" data-orig-width=\"1199\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en-US/homerun/consumer_reports_689/914428061489f8e82be00300c62b0434\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b2b1b957e29caecbc21282a07f73f246/tumblr_inline_ppvcuwN6Z51thnhmz_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"674\" data-orig-width=\"1199\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en-US/homerun/consumer_reports_689/914428061489f8e82be00300c62b0434\"/></figure><p>In the days and weeks following the death, as the Overtons tried to make sense of what happened, they looked online and read about the Fisher-Price Rock \u2019n Play. The new parents had trusted that the product was safe for sleeping because that is how it is marketed. On the Fisher-Price website, the product is touted for \u201cnaptime and nighttime,\u201d and the product\u2019s packaging says things such as \u201cInclined sleeper designed for all-night sleep.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But the couple\u2019s internet searches revealed a different story. There were posts from parents and pediatricians describing the product as dangerous, prone to interfering with an infant\u2019s ability to breathe. The Overtons learned that though sudden infant deaths can occur with no clear cause\u2014and there can be many factors involved\u2014experts warned that this particular product, and infant inclined sleep products in general, pose an increased risk of infant death.</p> \n  <p>The Overtons had received their Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper as a hand-me-down from their neighbors, who had said that, when their child was an infant, the product had been a lifesaver. But, Keenan said, the Overtons became convinced that was \u201cthe opposite of what it was.\u201d</p> \n  <p>On Jan. 6, 2018, Evan posted a review on Amazon warning parents about the product: \u201cI lost my son in this horrible contraption December 22 &hellip; this should not be marketed as a sleeper!&ldquo;</p> \n  <p>When asked by CR about the Overton incident, the company responded, \u201cThe loss of a child is an unimaginable tragedy.\u201d Fisher-Price also confirmed that the Overtons\u2019 case was one of the 10 cited by the company in the joint alert issued with the CPSC on April 5.</p> \n  <h2>History of a Dangerous Product</h2> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.fisher-price.com/en_US/ourstory/rock-n-play-sleeper/index.html\">Fisher-Price</a> says on its website that the company started developing the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper when one of its designers had a baby boy who had trouble sleeping because of acid reflux. The designer\u2019s doctors suggested elevating the infant\u2019s head, prompting her and the company to create a sleeper that would keep her son at a 30-degree incline during sleep.</p> \n  <p>Fisher-Price told CR that it \u201cengaged a leading engineering and scientific consulting firm,\u201d which concluded that the \u201cRock \u2019n Play Sleeper presents a lower risk of fatality than cribs and bassinets/cradles.\u201d<a href=\"https://www.fisher-price.com/en_US/ourstory/rock-n-play-sleeper/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p> \n  <p>Documents filed in an Atlanta lawsuit against Fisher-Price identified a medical consultant hired by the company to be Gary Deegear, M.D., a physician in San Antonio. According to these documents, he offered Fisher-Price assurance about the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper\u2019s safety. For example, Kitty Pilarz\u2014vice president of product safety and regulatory compliance for Mattel\u2014wrote in one email: \u201cDr. Deegear stated pediatricians recommend babies with reflux sleep at 30 degrees, this is just fine, or sleep in a car seat.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But there are several reasons to be concerned about this advice.</p> \n  <p>For one, Deegear is not a pediatrician or a sleep specialist, according to the Texas Medical Board, but was a family practice doctor. CR attempted to contact Deegear but could not reach him for comment.</p> \n  <p>For another, the AAP and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development have long counseled against letting infants sleep unsupervised in a reclined position.</p> \n  <p>Shortly after the recent joint alert from the CPSC and Fisher-Price, the AAP tweeted that \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/healthychildren/status/1114279069120643073\" target=\"_blank\">The Rock \u2019n Play should not be used for routine sleep</a>; If you use the Rock \u2019n Play for soothing, always strap the baby in and never leave the baby unattended.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t recommend that babies are placed to sleep with their heads elevated because that is a position that would be subject to accidental suffocation [and] strangulation in bed,\u201d said Feldman-Winter of the AAP. Instead, the AAP says that for prolonged or nighttime sleep, babies should be put on their backs, unrestrained, alone, on a flat, firm surface, such as a mattress covered by a fitted sheet in a bare crib, bassinet, or play yard.</p> \n  <p>And, experts say, parents should never use a car seat, stroller, swing, sling, wedge, or any other similar product for unsupervised sleep.</p> \n  <p>That recommendation applies even to babies with acid reflux, Feldman-Winter said. She recognizes that some parents have heard that sleeping on an incline can ease that problem and understands the desperation parents can feel when a crying baby can\u2019t sleep. But \u201cthere\u2019s no evidence to suggest that being on an incline is helpful for reflux,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a misconception that that\u2019s somehow an okay, safe sleep position, and it\u2019s just not.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The AAP also doesn\u2019t recommend for routine use sleeping devices that require the use of restraints because a baby could roll or turn into an unsafe position and be incapable of moving, leading to suffocation or strangulation.</p> \n  <p>That\u2019s one of the reasons experts <a href=\"https://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/cribs-are-for-sleeping,-car-seats-are-for-traveling-danger-in-using-sitting-and-carrying-devices-for-sleeping-infants\" target=\"_blank\">caution against using infant car seats for unsupervised sleep</a>. Those products are \u201cacceptable for shorter periods of time because it\u2019s the safest position for a crash,\u201d said Paul Gaudreau, a mechanical engineer who currently works for UPPAbaby and has experience in the car-seat industry. But, he said, <a href=\"https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(15)00345-5/pdf\" target=\"_blank\">research</a>\u00a0(PDF) shows that a <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/Car-Seats-Lower-Oxygen-Levels-of-Newborns.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">baby\u2019s oxygen level can drop</a> when sleeping at an incline in a car seat. And medical experts warn that the straps can lead to strangulation. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve steered companies that I\u2019ve worked for away from doing inclined sleepers.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Finally, the basic advice\u2014that babies should sleep on level, firm surfaces\u2014dates back to 1994, well before Fisher-Price created its Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper. That\u2019s when the AAP and other groups introduced the <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/A-Parents-Guide-to-Safe-Sleep.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cBack to Sleep\u201d campaign</a> to reduce the risk of SIDS and other sleep-related causes of death. That <a href=\"https://safetosleep.nichd.nih.gov/activities/campaign\">campaign</a> (now called \u201c<a href=\"https://safetosleep.nichd.nih.gov/safesleepbasics/about\" target=\"_blank\">Safe to Sleep</a>\u201d) has helped cut the rate of SIDS by almost a half.</p> \n  <p>Roy Benaroch, M.D., an associate adjunct professor of pediatrics at Emory University in Atlanta, who has blogged about the safety risks of the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper, told CR that parents are confused by the product at a time when they are especially vulnerable.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s tough because you don\u2019t sleep, the baby is not sleeping, parents are exhausted, and they\u2019re looking for a solution,\u201d he said. But \u201cparents are assuming a lot of risk by using this rather than following the safety guidelines.\u201d Bottom line: \u201cIf you let your baby sleep in this thing, there\u2019s an increased risk of death,\u201d Benaroch said.</p> \n  <h2>Regulatory Side Steps</h2> \n  <p>When Fisher-Price first introduced the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper, it marketed the product along with its bassinets. But less than a year later, in 2010, the CPSC began revising the standards for infant sleep surfaces, including bassinets, and issued a proposed rule that would require those products to be firm and flat, with an angle of 5 degrees or less when the product was at rest, rather than rocking or swinging.</p> \n  <p>Instead of adjusting the incline of its product, Pilarz, at Mattel, asked the CPSC for a revision to that proposed rule to account for products like the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper. Not making that change, she said, could actually \u201cincrease the risk of injury: Parents deprived of any appropriate product for calming their tired, colicky infants will look elsewhere\u2014and substitute products dangerous for that purpose.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Ultimately, in October 2013, the CPSC excluded products with an incline of greater than 10 degrees from its mandatory bassinet and cradle standards.</p> \n  <p>Armed with that exclusion, Fisher-Price and other industry reps went to ASTM International\u2014an organization that sets voluntary safety standards for consumer products and includes representatives from the government, industry, and the public\u2014to finish a voluntary standard for a new category: inclined infant sleep products.</p> \n  <p>Some ASTM members had objected to creating a new category and standard for those products. \u201cBy putting a standard in, you\u2019re telling people that &hellip; it must be safe,\u201d said Nancy Cowles, executive director of Kids in Danger, a nonprofit that focuses on reducing childhood injuries from consumer products. The voluntary ASTM standard, she worried, would create confusion for consumers and give new parents a false sense of security about a product that she felt was anything but secure.</p> \n  <p>Nevertheless, ASTM agreed to form a committee to develop a standard for the category. And they appointed Michael Steinwachs\u2014one of the primary engineers at Fisher-Price involved in designing the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper\u2014chairperson of that committee. The voluntary standard for infant inclined sleep products was ultimately established in 2015.</p> \n  <p>Cowles, at KID, was disappointed but not surprised that the product category was established. \u201cYou can talk safety till you\u2019re blue in the face, but if parents will buy them\u2014and [the company] can always justify the incidents that happen as being the parents\u2019 fault\u2014then they\u2019re going to keep selling them,\u201d Cowles said.</p> \n  <h2>Warnings From Around the World</h2> \n  <p>Other health and regulatory agencies were not as easily sold on the infant inclined sleeper, according to documents in the Hidalgo County lawsuit.\u00a0</p> \n  <p>Around January 2011, Australian regulators, for example, wrote to Mattel, explaining why they did not think the item should be marketed as a sleep product. They said that the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper \u201cis at odds with widely accepted and promoted best practices that these types of products should not be used as an infant bedding alternative.\u201d They also explained that because of the product\u2019s angle, \u201cbabies\u2019 heads can easily fall forward in a way that obstructs their airways.\u201d Fisher-Price confirmed it still does not sell the product in Australia.\u00a0</p> \n  <p>In Canada, the product is available\u2014but was reclassified from a \u201csleeper\u201d to a \u201csoother\u201d and is now marketed and sold as the Rock \u2019n Play Soothing Seat. This was because in February 2011 a representative from Health Canada wrote to Mattel Canada stating that public health officials there had concerns about the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper \u201cin light of the Safe Sleep recommendations of Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada, and the Canadian Pediatric Society.\u201d</p> \n  <p>In the United Kingdom, the Rock \u2019n Play is for sale as a \u201csleeper,\u201d despite misgivings from health organizations. In February 2011, the Royal College of Midwives in the U.K. told Fisher-Price that the product was suitable only for short periods of supervised play and that the group would not endorse the product as a sleeper. After receiving that news, a Fisher-Price employee wrote in an internal email, \u201cPlease see attached the findings from the Royal College of Midwives testing on the sleeper. I\u2019m afraid the findings don\u2019t have good implications for a UK launch.\u201d\u00a0</p> \n  <h2>What Parents Should Do</h2> \n  <p>Given the number of injuries and deaths, consumer safety advocates question why neither Mattel nor the CPSC has yet initiated a recall.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIn cases like these, where the product is on the market and there have been incidents associated with it, it\u2019s very difficult to understand why the enforcement agency with jurisdiction over this product wouldn\u2019t take action,\u201d said Rachel Weintraub, legislative director and general counsel of the Consumer Federation of America. \u201cWhen we know there are products that are posing risks and causing fatalities, that product in almost every case needs to be taken off the market.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The alert issued by the CPSC and Fisher-Price is inadequate, said Cowles of KID. She reiterated that children should not sleep restrained, and that children should sleep on flat surfaces, not inclines.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThey should get rid of this product category,\u201d Cowles said. \u201cAnything intended for infant sleep should be flat. And then there should be specific recalls on the products that have been involved in deaths.\u201d</p> \n  <p>CR safety experts agree and recommend that anyone who currently has a Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper should immediately stop using it for routine sleep. Instead, babies should be put to <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/A-Parents-Guide-to-Safe-Sleep.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">bed</a>\u00a0alone, on their backs, on a firm, flat mattress in a crib, bassinet, or play yard.</p>",

These products conflict with American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 safe sleep recommendations, and manufacturers should pull them off the market.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The alert issued Friday by the CPSC and Fisher-Price follows a previous one from the CPSC nearly a year ago, <a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/content/cpsc-consumer-alert-caregivers-urged-to-use-restraints-with-inclined-sleep-products?mod=article_inline\" target=\"_blank\">warning consumers about infant deaths</a>\u00a0associated with inclined sleep products without naming the Fisher-Price Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper.</p> \n  <p>The CPSC told CR in an emailed statement, \u201cAt this time, we are focusing on deaths associated with the rollover hazard, though we acknowledge that we are aware of other deaths that have occurred in the Rock \u2019n Play.\u201d The statement also said that the agency is \u201ccontinuing to evaluate the product and investigate whether it contains a defect \u2026 and if the evidence indicates a need for a recall, we will take that step.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But CR\u2019s investigation\u2014based in part on previously undisclosed CPSC data as well as reviews of lawsuits and interviews with numerous medical experts, product engineers, government and industry officials, and parents\u2014raises questions about how the product was developed and marketed in the first place, and allowed to remain for sale despite incidents dating back many years. It also highlights a larger weakness in the regulatory systems meant to protect consumers, including children, from hazardous products.</p> \n  <h2>A Long List of Deaths</h2> \n  <p>The earliest death that CR uncovered occurred in 2011, with more in the years that followed. There is, for example, the mother in Hidalgo County, Texas, who placed her 2-month old daughter on her back for a night\u2019s sleep on Oct. 19, 2013, according to a lawsuit filed by the family against Fisher-Price. At 4 a.m., when the mother checked, all was well, but by 7 a.m., the baby had stopped breathing. Her head was tilted to the side with her chin on her shoulder, compressing her airway. She was pronounced dead at the scene from positional asphyxia, or an inability to breathe caused by her position.</p> \n  <p>The most recent deaths CR found occurred in spring 2018\u2014one involving a 1-month-old girl in Knoxville, Tenn., and the other a 9-day-old boy in Copperas Cove, Texas.</p> \n  <p>There have also been some close calls. In one, on July 25, 2014, a 7-week-old boy was placed in a Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper while his grandmother was in the room, according to a lawsuit filed against Fisher-Price that was ultimately dismissed.</p> \n  <p>The grandmother, Jan Hinson, of Greenville, S.C., says she looked at her grandson and saw he was \u201ccocked over all the way, and he was blue and lifeless. It was absolutely awful.\u201d She got the infant breathing again, and after a stay in the hospital, he was released.</p> \n  <p>Hinson, who is also a lawyer, is now representing a Virginia couple, Evan and Keenan Overton, whose son died while in a Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper.</p> \n  <p>A few days before Christmas in 2017, 5-month-old Ezra was asleep in the product while Keenan slept on a couch nearby. When Keenan woke in the middle of the night, he found Ezra on his stomach, unresponsive, and yelled for Evan to call 911. \u201cHe was blue, and his body was, it was hard, and he didn\u2019t feel real,\u201d Evan said. Ezra was pronounced dead at the hospital; \u201casphyxia\u201d was listed as the immediate cause of death. (The Overtons say Ezra was buckled in the sleeper, though the death certificate states the baby was unrestrained.)</p> \n  <figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"674\" data-orig-width=\"1199\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en-US/homerun/consumer_reports_689/914428061489f8e82be00300c62b0434\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b2b1b957e29caecbc21282a07f73f246/tumblr_inline_ppvcuwN6Z51thnhmz_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"674\" data-orig-width=\"1199\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en-US/homerun/consumer_reports_689/914428061489f8e82be00300c62b0434\"></figure><p>In the days and weeks following the death, as the Overtons tried to make sense of what happened, they looked online and read about the Fisher-Price Rock \u2019n Play. The new parents had trusted that the product was safe for sleeping because that is how it is marketed. On the Fisher-Price website, the product is touted for \u201cnaptime and nighttime,\u201d and the product\u2019s packaging says things such as \u201cInclined sleeper designed for all-night sleep.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But the couple\u2019s internet searches revealed a different story. There were posts from parents and pediatricians describing the product as dangerous, prone to interfering with an infant\u2019s ability to breathe. The Overtons learned that though sudden infant deaths can occur with no clear cause\u2014and there can be many factors involved\u2014experts warned that this particular product, and infant inclined sleep products in general, pose an increased risk of infant death.</p> \n  <p>The Overtons had received their Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper as a hand-me-down from their neighbors, who had said that, when their child was an infant, the product had been a lifesaver. But, Keenan said, the Overtons became convinced that was \u201cthe opposite of what it was.\u201d</p> \n  <p>On Jan. 6, 2018, Evan posted a review on Amazon warning parents about the product: \u201cI lost my son in this horrible contraption December 22 \u2026 this should not be marketed as a sleeper!\u201c</p> \n  <p>When asked by CR about the Overton incident, the company responded, \u201cThe loss of a child is an unimaginable tragedy.\u201d Fisher-Price also confirmed that the Overtons\u2019 case was one of the 10 cited by the company in the joint alert issued with the CPSC on April 5.</p> \n  <h2>History of a Dangerous Product</h2> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.fisher-price.com/en_US/ourstory/rock-n-play-sleeper/index.html\">Fisher-Price</a> says on its website that the company started developing the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper when one of its designers had a baby boy who had trouble sleeping because of acid reflux. The designer\u2019s doctors suggested elevating the infant\u2019s head, prompting her and the company to create a sleeper that would keep her son at a 30-degree incline during sleep.</p> \n  <p>Fisher-Price told CR that it \u201cengaged a leading engineering and scientific consulting firm,\u201d which concluded that the \u201cRock \u2019n Play Sleeper presents a lower risk of fatality than cribs and bassinets/cradles.\u201d<a href=\"https://www.fisher-price.com/en_US/ourstory/rock-n-play-sleeper/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p> \n  <p>Documents filed in an Atlanta lawsuit against Fisher-Price identified a medical consultant hired by the company to be Gary Deegear, M.D., a physician in San Antonio. According to these documents, he offered Fisher-Price assurance about the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper\u2019s safety. For example, Kitty Pilarz\u2014vice president of product safety and regulatory compliance for Mattel\u2014wrote in one email: \u201cDr. Deegear stated pediatricians recommend babies with reflux sleep at 30 degrees, this is just fine, or sleep in a car seat.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But there are several reasons to be concerned about this advice.</p> \n  <p>For one, Deegear is not a pediatrician or a sleep specialist, according to the Texas Medical Board, but was a family practice doctor. CR attempted to contact Deegear but could not reach him for comment.</p> \n  <p>For another, the AAP and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development have long counseled against letting infants sleep unsupervised in a reclined position.</p> \n  <p>Shortly after the recent joint alert from the CPSC and Fisher-Price, the AAP tweeted that \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/healthychildren/status/1114279069120643073\" target=\"_blank\">The Rock \u2019n Play should not be used for routine sleep</a>; If you use the Rock \u2019n Play for soothing, always strap the baby in and never leave the baby unattended.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t recommend that babies are placed to sleep with their heads elevated because that is a position that would be subject to accidental suffocation [and] strangulation in bed,\u201d said Feldman-Winter of the AAP. Instead, the AAP says that for prolonged or nighttime sleep, babies should be put on their backs, unrestrained, alone, on a flat, firm surface, such as a mattress covered by a fitted sheet in a bare crib, bassinet, or play yard.</p> \n  <p>And, experts say, parents should never use a car seat, stroller, swing, sling, wedge, or any other similar product for unsupervised sleep.</p> \n  <p>That recommendation applies even to babies with acid reflux, Feldman-Winter said. She recognizes that some parents have heard that sleeping on an incline can ease that problem and understands the desperation parents can feel when a crying baby can\u2019t sleep. But \u201cthere\u2019s no evidence to suggest that being on an incline is helpful for reflux,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a misconception that that\u2019s somehow an okay, safe sleep position, and it\u2019s just not.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The AAP also doesn\u2019t recommend for routine use sleeping devices that require the use of restraints because a baby could roll or turn into an unsafe position and be incapable of moving, leading to suffocation or strangulation.</p> \n  <p>That\u2019s one of the reasons experts <a href=\"https://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/cribs-are-for-sleeping,-car-seats-are-for-traveling-danger-in-using-sitting-and-carrying-devices-for-sleeping-infants\" target=\"_blank\">caution against using infant car seats for unsupervised sleep</a>. Those products are \u201cacceptable for shorter periods of time because it\u2019s the safest position for a crash,\u201d said Paul Gaudreau, a mechanical engineer who currently works for UPPAbaby and has experience in the car-seat industry. But, he said, <a href=\"https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(15)00345-5/pdf\" target=\"_blank\">research</a>\u00a0(PDF) shows that a <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/Car-Seats-Lower-Oxygen-Levels-of-Newborns.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">baby\u2019s oxygen level can drop</a> when sleeping at an incline in a car seat. And medical experts warn that the straps can lead to strangulation. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve steered companies that I\u2019ve worked for away from doing inclined sleepers.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Finally, the basic advice\u2014that babies should sleep on level, firm surfaces\u2014dates back to 1994, well before Fisher-Price created its Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper. That\u2019s when the AAP and other groups introduced the <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/A-Parents-Guide-to-Safe-Sleep.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cBack to Sleep\u201d campaign</a> to reduce the risk of SIDS and other sleep-related causes of death. That <a href=\"https://safetosleep.nichd.nih.gov/activities/campaign\">campaign</a> (now called \u201c<a href=\"https://safetosleep.nichd.nih.gov/safesleepbasics/about\" target=\"_blank\">Safe to Sleep</a>\u201d) has helped cut the rate of SIDS by almost a half.</p> \n  <p>Roy Benaroch, M.D., an associate adjunct professor of pediatrics at Emory University in Atlanta, who has blogged about the safety risks of the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper, told CR that parents are confused by the product at a time when they are especially vulnerable.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s tough because you don\u2019t sleep, the baby is not sleeping, parents are exhausted, and they\u2019re looking for a solution,\u201d he said. But \u201cparents are assuming a lot of risk by using this rather than following the safety guidelines.\u201d Bottom line: \u201cIf you let your baby sleep in this thing, there\u2019s an increased risk of death,\u201d Benaroch said.</p> \n  <h2>Regulatory Side Steps</h2> \n  <p>When Fisher-Price first introduced the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper, it marketed the product along with its bassinets. But less than a year later, in 2010, the CPSC began revising the standards for infant sleep surfaces, including bassinets, and issued a proposed rule that would require those products to be firm and flat, with an angle of 5 degrees or less when the product was at rest, rather than rocking or swinging.</p> \n  <p>Instead of adjusting the incline of its product, Pilarz, at Mattel, asked the CPSC for a revision to that proposed rule to account for products like the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper. Not making that change, she said, could actually \u201cincrease the risk of injury: Parents deprived of any appropriate product for calming their tired, colicky infants will look elsewhere\u2014and substitute products dangerous for that purpose.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Ultimately, in October 2013, the CPSC excluded products with an incline of greater than 10 degrees from its mandatory bassinet and cradle standards.</p> \n  <p>Armed with that exclusion, Fisher-Price and other industry reps went to ASTM International\u2014an organization that sets voluntary safety standards for consumer products and includes representatives from the government, industry, and the public\u2014to finish a voluntary standard for a new category: inclined infant sleep products.</p> \n  <p>Some ASTM members had objected to creating a new category and standard for those products. \u201cBy putting a standard in, you\u2019re telling people that \u2026 it must be safe,\u201d said Nancy Cowles, executive director of Kids in Danger, a nonprofit that focuses on reducing childhood injuries from consumer products. The voluntary ASTM standard, she worried, would create confusion for consumers and give new parents a false sense of security about a product that she felt was anything but secure.</p> \n  <p>Nevertheless, ASTM agreed to form a committee to develop a standard for the category. And they appointed Michael Steinwachs\u2014one of the primary engineers at Fisher-Price involved in designing the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper\u2014chairperson of that committee. The voluntary standard for infant inclined sleep products was ultimately established in 2015.</p> \n  <p>Cowles, at KID, was disappointed but not surprised that the product category was established. \u201cYou can talk safety till you\u2019re blue in the face, but if parents will buy them\u2014and [the company] can always justify the incidents that happen as being the parents\u2019 fault\u2014then they\u2019re going to keep selling them,\u201d Cowles said.</p> \n  <h2>Warnings From Around the World</h2> \n  <p>Other health and regulatory agencies were not as easily sold on the infant inclined sleeper, according to documents in the Hidalgo County lawsuit.\u00a0</p> \n  <p>Around January 2011, Australian regulators, for example, wrote to Mattel, explaining why they did not think the item should be marketed as a sleep product. They said that the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper \u201cis at odds with widely accepted and promoted best practices that these types of products should not be used as an infant bedding alternative.\u201d They also explained that because of the product\u2019s angle, \u201cbabies\u2019 heads can easily fall forward in a way that obstructs their airways.\u201d Fisher-Price confirmed it still does not sell the product in Australia.\u00a0</p> \n  <p>In Canada, the product is available\u2014but was reclassified from a \u201csleeper\u201d to a \u201csoother\u201d and is now marketed and sold as the Rock \u2019n Play Soothing Seat. This was because in February 2011 a representative from Health Canada wrote to Mattel Canada stating that public health officials there had concerns about the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper \u201cin light of the Safe Sleep recommendations of Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada, and the Canadian Pediatric Society.\u201d</p> \n  <p>In the United Kingdom, the Rock \u2019n Play is for sale as a \u201csleeper,\u201d despite misgivings from health organizations. In February 2011, the Royal College of Midwives in the U.K. told Fisher-Price that the product was suitable only for short periods of supervised play and that the group would not endorse the product as a sleeper. After receiving that news, a Fisher-Price employee wrote in an internal email, \u201cPlease see attached the findings from the Royal College of Midwives testing on the sleeper. I\u2019m afraid the findings don\u2019t have good implications for a UK launch.\u201d\u00a0</p> \n  <h2>What Parents Should Do</h2> \n  <p>Given the number of injuries and deaths, consumer safety advocates question why neither Mattel nor the CPSC has yet initiated a recall.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIn cases like these, where the product is on the market and there have been incidents associated with it, it\u2019s very difficult to understand why the enforcement agency with jurisdiction over this product wouldn\u2019t take action,\u201d said Rachel Weintraub, legislative director and general counsel of the Consumer Federation of America. \u201cWhen we know there are products that are posing risks and causing fatalities, that product in almost every case needs to be taken off the market.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The alert issued by the CPSC and Fisher-Price is inadequate, said Cowles of KID. She reiterated that children should not sleep restrained, and that children should sleep on flat surfaces, not inclines.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThey should get rid of this product category,\u201d Cowles said. \u201cAnything intended for infant sleep should be flat. And then there should be specific recalls on the products that have been involved in deaths.\u201d</p> \n  <p>CR safety experts agree and recommend that anyone who currently has a Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper should immediately stop using it for routine sleep. Instead, babies should be put to <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/A-Parents-Guide-to-Safe-Sleep.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">bed</a>\u00a0alone, on their backs, on a firm, flat mattress in a crib, bassinet, or play yard.</p></p>",

This story was originally published on April 8.</p> \n  <p>A Consumer Reports investigation into the safety of the Fisher-Price Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper\u2014a product designed and marketed for babies to sleep on an incline\u2014found that it is tied to at least 32 infant deaths.</p> \n  <p>Amid CR\u2019s investigation\u2014and days after we asked for comment\u2014the federal government and Fisher-Price on April 5 issued a warning about the product, which safety advocates believe does not go far enough. Medical experts tell CR that babies should be placed flat on their back alone and free of soft bedding\u2014and not at an incline\u2014to minimize the risk of accidental suffocation. Products such as the Fisher-Price Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper do not align with these recommendations.<br></p> \n  <p>The safety alert from the <a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2019/CPSC-ALERT-CPSC-and-Fisher-Price-Warn-Consumers-About-Fisher-Price-Rock-N-Play-Due-to-Reports-of-Death-When-Infants-Roll-Over-in-the-Product\" target=\"_blank\">Consumer Product Safety Commission and Fisher-Price</a> includes a warning from the CPSC for consumers to stop using the product when infants turn 3 months old or \u201cas soon as an infant exhibits rollover capabilities.\u201d The alert cites reports of \u201c10 infant deaths in the Rock \u2019n Play that have occurred since 2015, after the infants rolled from their back to their stomach or side, while unrestrained.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Despite these numbers, the product has not been recalled by Fisher-Price, part of the children\u2019s products giant Mattel, which had about $4.5 billion in sales in 2018. The deaths have prompted only warnings from the company and the CPSC, which does not have a mandatory safety standard for infant inclined sleep products.</p> \n  <p>Fisher-Price told CR in an emailed statement, \u201cThe loss of a child is a devastating tragedy. We will continue to do all we can to ensure that parents and caregivers <a href=\"https://fisher-pricesafety.com/?&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI7IHWhre_4QIVEo_ICh2NWQZoEAAYASAAEgLsWfD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\">have the information necessary</a> to create a safe sleep environment for infants.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But CR\u2019s ongoing investigation has turned up deaths of babies even younger than the 3-month threshold cited in the April 5 warning, and go beyond the risk of rollover.</p> \n  <p>Fisher-Price confirmed to CR that the company is aware of approximately 32 fatalities since the 2009 introduction of the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper, including the 10 noted in the joint release with the CPSC. Fisher-Price told CR that the company does not believe that \u201cany deaths have been caused by the product,\u201d citing \u201cthe many situations where a medical/health condition was identified as the cause of death, and/or those in which the product was clearly used in a manner contrary to the safety warnings and instructions.\u201d</p> \n  <p>While CR\u2019s review of the data shows that certain cases did have contributing factors such as illness or additional bedding, the number of incidents associated with the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper, combined with long-standing expert medical advice that babies should sleep on firm, flat surfaces, raises serious safety concerns about the product.\u00a0</p> \n  <figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"500\" data-orig-width=\"770\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en-US/homerun/consumer_reports_689/40940568ef8082e17303a97d7e133931\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aeae99502635e6735ade711705fb76e2/tumblr_inline_ppvcuw3m4v1thnhmz_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"500\" data-orig-width=\"770\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en-US/homerun/consumer_reports_689/40940568ef8082e17303a97d7e133931\"></figure><p>Further, the American Academy of Pediatrics says it does not recommend products for routine sleep that require restraining a baby, especially if that product also rocks. \u201cTo [fasten] a baby down to a surface and then rock the baby is not consistent with our recommendations,\u201d said Lori Feldman-Winter, M.D., a member of the AAP task force on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and a professor of pediatrics at Cooper Medical School of Rowan University in Camden, N.J.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBased on the deaths and injuries associated with the Fisher-Price Rock \u2019n Play, the product clearly puts infants\u2019 safety at risk and should be recalled immediately,\u201d says William Wallace, senior policy analyst at CR. \u201cAll other inclined sleepers should be investigated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. These products conflict with American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 safe sleep recommendations, and manufacturers should pull them off the market.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The alert issued Friday by the CPSC and Fisher-Price follows a previous one from the CPSC nearly a year ago, <a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/content/cpsc-consumer-alert-caregivers-urged-to-use-restraints-with-inclined-sleep-products?mod=article_inline\" target=\"_blank\">warning consumers about infant deaths</a>\u00a0associated with inclined sleep products without naming the Fisher-Price Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper.</p> \n  <p>The CPSC told CR in an emailed statement, \u201cAt this time, we are focusing on deaths associated with the rollover hazard, though we acknowledge that we are aware of other deaths that have occurred in the Rock \u2019n Play.\u201d The statement also said that the agency is \u201ccontinuing to evaluate the product and investigate whether it contains a defect \u2026 and if the evidence indicates a need for a recall, we will take that step.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But CR\u2019s investigation\u2014based in part on previously undisclosed CPSC data as well as reviews of lawsuits and interviews with numerous medical experts, product engineers, government and industry officials, and parents\u2014raises questions about how the product was developed and marketed in the first place, and allowed to remain for sale despite incidents dating back many years. It also highlights a larger weakness in the regulatory systems meant to protect consumers, including children, from hazardous products.</p> \n  <h2>A Long List of Deaths</h2> \n  <p>The earliest death that CR uncovered occurred in 2011, with more in the years that followed. There is, for example, the mother in Hidalgo County, Texas, who placed her 2-month old daughter on her back for a night\u2019s sleep on Oct. 19, 2013, according to a lawsuit filed by the family against Fisher-Price. At 4 a.m., when the mother checked, all was well, but by 7 a.m., the baby had stopped breathing. Her head was tilted to the side with her chin on her shoulder, compressing her airway. She was pronounced dead at the scene from positional asphyxia, or an inability to breathe caused by her position.</p> \n  <p>The most recent deaths CR found occurred in spring 2018\u2014one involving a 1-month-old girl in Knoxville, Tenn., and the other a 9-day-old boy in Copperas Cove, Texas.</p> \n  <p>There have also been some close calls. In one, on July 25, 2014, a 7-week-old boy was placed in a Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper while his grandmother was in the room, according to a lawsuit filed against Fisher-Price that was ultimately dismissed.</p> \n  <p>The grandmother, Jan Hinson, of Greenville, S.C., says she looked at her grandson and saw he was \u201ccocked over all the way, and he was blue and lifeless. It was absolutely awful.\u201d She got the infant breathing again, and after a stay in the hospital, he was released.</p> \n  <p>Hinson, who is also a lawyer, is now representing a Virginia couple, Evan and Keenan Overton, whose son died while in a Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper.</p> \n  <p>A few days before Christmas in 2017, 5-month-old Ezra was asleep in the product while Keenan slept on a couch nearby. When Keenan woke in the middle of the night, he found Ezra on his stomach, unresponsive, and yelled for Evan to call 911. \u201cHe was blue, and his body was, it was hard, and he didn\u2019t feel real,\u201d Evan said. Ezra was pronounced dead at the hospital; \u201casphyxia\u201d was listed as the immediate cause of death. (The Overtons say Ezra was buckled in the sleeper, though the death certificate states the baby was unrestrained.)</p> \n  <figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"674\" data-orig-width=\"1199\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en-US/homerun/consumer_reports_689/914428061489f8e82be00300c62b0434\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b2b1b957e29caecbc21282a07f73f246/tumblr_inline_ppvcuwN6Z51thnhmz_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"674\" data-orig-width=\"1199\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en-US/homerun/consumer_reports_689/914428061489f8e82be00300c62b0434\"></figure><p>In the days and weeks following the death, as the Overtons tried to make sense of what happened, they looked online and read about the Fisher-Price Rock \u2019n Play. The new parents had trusted that the product was safe for sleeping because that is how it is marketed. On the Fisher-Price website, the product is touted for \u201cnaptime and nighttime,\u201d and the product\u2019s packaging says things such as \u201cInclined sleeper designed for all-night sleep.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But the couple\u2019s internet searches revealed a different story. There were posts from parents and pediatricians describing the product as dangerous, prone to interfering with an infant\u2019s ability to breathe. The Overtons learned that though sudden infant deaths can occur with no clear cause\u2014and there can be many factors involved\u2014experts warned that this particular product, and infant inclined sleep products in general, pose an increased risk of infant death.</p> \n  <p>The Overtons had received their Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper as a hand-me-down from their neighbors, who had said that, when their child was an infant, the product had been a lifesaver. But, Keenan said, the Overtons became convinced that was \u201cthe opposite of what it was.\u201d</p> \n  <p>On Jan. 6, 2018, Evan posted a review on Amazon warning parents about the product: \u201cI lost my son in this horrible contraption December 22 \u2026 this should not be marketed as a sleeper!\u201c</p> \n  <p>When asked by CR about the Overton incident, the company responded, \u201cThe loss of a child is an unimaginable tragedy.\u201d Fisher-Price also confirmed that the Overtons\u2019 case was one of the 10 cited by the company in the joint alert issued with the CPSC on April 5.</p> \n  <h2>History of a Dangerous Product</h2> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.fisher-price.com/en_US/ourstory/rock-n-play-sleeper/index.html\">Fisher-Price</a> says on its website that the company started developing the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper when one of its designers had a baby boy who had trouble sleeping because of acid reflux. The designer\u2019s doctors suggested elevating the infant\u2019s head, prompting her and the company to create a sleeper that would keep her son at a 30-degree incline during sleep.</p> \n  <p>Fisher-Price told CR that it \u201cengaged a leading engineering and scientific consulting firm,\u201d which concluded that the \u201cRock \u2019n Play Sleeper presents a lower risk of fatality than cribs and bassinets/cradles.\u201d<a href=\"https://www.fisher-price.com/en_US/ourstory/rock-n-play-sleeper/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p> \n  <p>Documents filed in an Atlanta lawsuit against Fisher-Price identified a medical consultant hired by the company to be Gary Deegear, M.D., a physician in San Antonio. According to these documents, he offered Fisher-Price assurance about the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper\u2019s safety. For example, Kitty Pilarz\u2014vice president of product safety and regulatory compliance for Mattel\u2014wrote in one email: \u201cDr. Deegear stated pediatricians recommend babies with reflux sleep at 30 degrees, this is just fine, or sleep in a car seat.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But there are several reasons to be concerned about this advice.</p> \n  <p>For one, Deegear is not a pediatrician or a sleep specialist, according to the Texas Medical Board, but was a family practice doctor. CR attempted to contact Deegear but could not reach him for comment.</p> \n  <p>For another, the AAP and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development have long counseled against letting infants sleep unsupervised in a reclined position.</p> \n  <p>Shortly after the recent joint alert from the CPSC and Fisher-Price, the AAP tweeted that \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/healthychildren/status/1114279069120643073\" target=\"_blank\">The Rock \u2019n Play should not be used for routine sleep</a>; If you use the Rock \u2019n Play for soothing, always strap the baby in and never leave the baby unattended.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t recommend that babies are placed to sleep with their heads elevated because that is a position that would be subject to accidental suffocation [and] strangulation in bed,\u201d said Feldman-Winter of the AAP. Instead, the AAP says that for prolonged or nighttime sleep, babies should be put on their backs, unrestrained, alone, on a flat, firm surface, such as a mattress covered by a fitted sheet in a bare crib, bassinet, or play yard.</p> \n  <p>And, experts say, parents should never use a car seat, stroller, swing, sling, wedge, or any other similar product for unsupervised sleep.</p> \n  <p>That recommendation applies even to babies with acid reflux, Feldman-Winter said. She recognizes that some parents have heard that sleeping on an incline can ease that problem and understands the desperation parents can feel when a crying baby can\u2019t sleep. But \u201cthere\u2019s no evidence to suggest that being on an incline is helpful for reflux,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a misconception that that\u2019s somehow an okay, safe sleep position, and it\u2019s just not.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The AAP also doesn\u2019t recommend for routine use sleeping devices that require the use of restraints because a baby could roll or turn into an unsafe position and be incapable of moving, leading to suffocation or strangulation.</p> \n  <p>That\u2019s one of the reasons experts <a href=\"https://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/cribs-are-for-sleeping,-car-seats-are-for-traveling-danger-in-using-sitting-and-carrying-devices-for-sleeping-infants\" target=\"_blank\">caution against using infant car seats for unsupervised sleep</a>. Those products are \u201cacceptable for shorter periods of time because it\u2019s the safest position for a crash,\u201d said Paul Gaudreau, a mechanical engineer who currently works for UPPAbaby and has experience in the car-seat industry. But, he said, <a href=\"https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(15)00345-5/pdf\" target=\"_blank\">research</a>\u00a0(PDF) shows that a <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/Car-Seats-Lower-Oxygen-Levels-of-Newborns.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">baby\u2019s oxygen level can drop</a> when sleeping at an incline in a car seat. And medical experts warn that the straps can lead to strangulation. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve steered companies that I\u2019ve worked for away from doing inclined sleepers.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Finally, the basic advice\u2014that babies should sleep on level, firm surfaces\u2014dates back to 1994, well before Fisher-Price created its Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper. That\u2019s when the AAP and other groups introduced the <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/A-Parents-Guide-to-Safe-Sleep.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cBack to Sleep\u201d campaign</a> to reduce the risk of SIDS and other sleep-related causes of death. That <a href=\"https://safetosleep.nichd.nih.gov/activities/campaign\">campaign</a> (now called \u201c<a href=\"https://safetosleep.nichd.nih.gov/safesleepbasics/about\" target=\"_blank\">Safe to Sleep</a>\u201d) has helped cut the rate of SIDS by almost a half.</p> \n  <p>Roy Benaroch, M.D., an associate adjunct professor of pediatrics at Emory University in Atlanta, who has blogged about the safety risks of the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper, told CR that parents are confused by the product at a time when they are especially vulnerable.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s tough because you don\u2019t sleep, the baby is not sleeping, parents are exhausted, and they\u2019re looking for a solution,\u201d he said. But \u201cparents are assuming a lot of risk by using this rather than following the safety guidelines.\u201d Bottom line: \u201cIf you let your baby sleep in this thing, there\u2019s an increased risk of death,\u201d Benaroch said.</p> \n  <h2>Regulatory Side Steps</h2> \n  <p>When Fisher-Price first introduced the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper, it marketed the product along with its bassinets. But less than a year later, in 2010, the CPSC began revising the standards for infant sleep surfaces, including bassinets, and issued a proposed rule that would require those products to be firm and flat, with an angle of 5 degrees or less when the product was at rest, rather than rocking or swinging.</p> \n  <p>Instead of adjusting the incline of its product, Pilarz, at Mattel, asked the CPSC for a revision to that proposed rule to account for products like the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper. Not making that change, she said, could actually \u201cincrease the risk of injury: Parents deprived of any appropriate product for calming their tired, colicky infants will look elsewhere\u2014and substitute products dangerous for that purpose.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Ultimately, in October 2013, the CPSC excluded products with an incline of greater than 10 degrees from its mandatory bassinet and cradle standards.</p> \n  <p>Armed with that exclusion, Fisher-Price and other industry reps went to ASTM International\u2014an organization that sets voluntary safety standards for consumer products and includes representatives from the government, industry, and the public\u2014to finish a voluntary standard for a new category: inclined infant sleep products.</p> \n  <p>Some ASTM members had objected to creating a new category and standard for those products. \u201cBy putting a standard in, you\u2019re telling people that \u2026 it must be safe,\u201d said Nancy Cowles, executive director of Kids in Danger, a nonprofit that focuses on reducing childhood injuries from consumer products. The voluntary ASTM standard, she worried, would create confusion for consumers and give new parents a false sense of security about a product that she felt was anything but secure.</p> \n  <p>Nevertheless, ASTM agreed to form a committee to develop a standard for the category. And they appointed Michael Steinwachs\u2014one of the primary engineers at Fisher-Price involved in designing the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper\u2014chairperson of that committee. The voluntary standard for infant inclined sleep products was ultimately established in 2015.</p> \n  <p>Cowles, at KID, was disappointed but not surprised that the product category was established. \u201cYou can talk safety till you\u2019re blue in the face, but if parents will buy them\u2014and [the company] can always justify the incidents that happen as being the parents\u2019 fault\u2014then they\u2019re going to keep selling them,\u201d Cowles said.</p> \n  <h2>Warnings From Around the World</h2> \n  <p>Other health and regulatory agencies were not as easily sold on the infant inclined sleeper, according to documents in the Hidalgo County lawsuit.\u00a0</p> \n  <p>Around January 2011, Australian regulators, for example, wrote to Mattel, explaining why they did not think the item should be marketed as a sleep product. They said that the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper \u201cis at odds with widely accepted and promoted best practices that these types of products should not be used as an infant bedding alternative.\u201d They also explained that because of the product\u2019s angle, \u201cbabies\u2019 heads can easily fall forward in a way that obstructs their airways.\u201d Fisher-Price confirmed it still does not sell the product in Australia.\u00a0</p> \n  <p>In Canada, the product is available\u2014but was reclassified from a \u201csleeper\u201d to a \u201csoother\u201d and is now marketed and sold as the Rock \u2019n Play Soothing Seat. This was because in February 2011 a representative from Health Canada wrote to Mattel Canada stating that public health officials there had concerns about the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper \u201cin light of the Safe Sleep recommendations of Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada, and the Canadian Pediatric Society.\u201d</p> \n  <p>In the United Kingdom, the Rock \u2019n Play is for sale as a \u201csleeper,\u201d despite misgivings from health organizations. In February 2011, the Royal College of Midwives in the U.K. told Fisher-Price that the product was suitable only for short periods of supervised play and that the group would not endorse the product as a sleeper. After receiving that news, a Fisher-Price employee wrote in an internal email, \u201cPlease see attached the findings from the Royal College of Midwives testing on the sleeper. I\u2019m afraid the findings don\u2019t have good implications for a UK launch.\u201d\u00a0</p> \n  <h2>What Parents Should Do</h2> \n  <p>Given the number of injuries and deaths, consumer safety advocates question why neither Mattel nor the CPSC has yet initiated a recall.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIn cases like these, where the product is on the market and there have been incidents associated with it, it\u2019s very difficult to understand why the enforcement agency with jurisdiction over this product wouldn\u2019t take action,\u201d said Rachel Weintraub, legislative director and general counsel of the Consumer Federation of America. \u201cWhen we know there are products that are posing risks and causing fatalities, that product in almost every case needs to be taken off the market.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The alert issued by the CPSC and Fisher-Price is inadequate, said Cowles of KID. She reiterated that children should not sleep restrained, and that children should sleep on flat surfaces, not inclines.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThey should get rid of this product category,\u201d Cowles said. \u201cAnything intended for infant sleep should be flat. And then there should be specific recalls on the products that have been involved in deaths.\u201d</p> \n  <p>CR safety experts agree and recommend that anyone who currently has a Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper should immediately stop using it for routine sleep. Instead, babies should be put to <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/A-Parents-Guide-to-Safe-Sleep.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">bed</a>\u00a0alone, on their backs, on a firm, flat mattress in a crib, bassinet, or play yard.</p></p>",

This story was originally published on April 8.</p> \n  <p>A Consumer Reports investigation into the safety of the Fisher-Price Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper&mdash;a product designed and marketed for babies to sleep on an incline&mdash;found that it is tied to at least 32 infant deaths.</p> \n  <p>Amid CR&rsquo;s investigation&mdash;and days after we asked for comment&mdash;the federal government and Fisher-Price on April 5 issued a warning about the product, which safety advocates believe does not go far enough.

Fisher-Price told CR that the company does not believe that &ldquo;any deaths have been caused by the product,&rdquo; citing &ldquo;the many situations where a medical/health condition was identified as the cause of death, and/or those in which the product was clearly used in a manner contrary to the safety warnings and instructions.&rdquo;</p> \n  <p>While CR&rsquo;s review of the data shows that certain cases did have contributing factors such as illness or additional bedding, the number of incidents associated with the Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper, combined with long-standing expert medical advice that babies should sleep on firm, flat surfaces, raises serious safety concerns about the product.&nbsp;</p> \n  <figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aeae99502635e6735ade711705fb76e2/tumblr_inline_ppvcuw3m4v1thnhmz_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Further, the American Academy of Pediatrics says it does not recommend products for routine sleep that require restraining a baby, especially if that product also rocks. &ldquo;To [fasten] a baby down to a surface and then rock the baby is not consistent with our recommendations,&rdquo; said Lori Feldman-Winter, M.D., a member of the AAP task force on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and a professor of pediatrics at Cooper Medical School of Rowan University in Camden, N.J.</p> \n  <p>&ldquo;Based on the deaths and injuries associated with the Fisher-Price Rock &rsquo;n Play, the product clearly puts infants&rsquo; safety at risk and should be recalled immediately,&rdquo; says William Wallace, senior policy analyst at CR. &ldquo;All other inclined sleepers should be investigated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. These products conflict with American Academy of Pediatrics&rsquo; safe sleep recommendations, and manufacturers should pull them off the market.&rdquo;</p> \n  <p>The alert issued Friday by the CPSC and Fisher-Price follows a previous one from the CPSC nearly a year ago, <a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/content/cpsc-consumer-alert-caregivers-urged-to-use-restraints-with-inclined-sleep-products?mod=article_inline\" target=\"_blank\">warning consumers about infant deaths</a>&nbsp;associated with inclined sleep products without naming the Fisher-Price Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper.</p> \n  <p>The CPSC told CR in an emailed statement, &ldquo;At this time, we are focusing on deaths associated with the rollover hazard, though we acknowledge that we are aware of other deaths that have occurred in the Rock &rsquo;n Play.&rdquo; The statement also said that the agency is &ldquo;continuing to evaluate the product and investigate whether it contains a defect &hellip; and if the evidence indicates a need for a recall, we will take that step.&rdquo;</p> \n  <p>But CR&rsquo;s investigation&mdash;based in part on previously undisclosed CPSC data as well as reviews of lawsuits and interviews with numerous medical experts, product engineers, government and industry officials, and parents&mdash;raises questions about how the product was developed and marketed in the first place, and allowed to remain for sale despite incidents dating back many years. It also highlights a larger weakness in the regulatory systems meant to protect consumers, including children, from hazardous products.</p> \n  <h2>A Long List of Deaths</h2> \n  <p>The earliest death that CR uncovered occurred in 2011, with more in the years that followed. There is, for example, the mother in Hidalgo County, Texas, who placed her 2-month old daughter on her back for a night&rsquo;s sleep on Oct. 19, 2013, according to a lawsuit filed by the family against Fisher-Price. At 4 a.m., when the mother checked, all was well, but by 7 a.m., the baby had stopped breathing. Her head was tilted to the side with her chin on her shoulder, compressing her airway. She was pronounced dead at the scene from positional asphyxia, or an inability to breathe caused by her position.</p> \n  <p>The most recent deaths CR found occurred in spring 2018&mdash;one involving a 1-month-old girl in Knoxville, Tenn., and the other a 9-day-old boy in Copperas Cove, Texas.</p> \n  <p>There have also been some close calls. In one, on July 25, 2014, a 7-week-old boy was placed in a Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper while his grandmother was in the room, according to a lawsuit filed against Fisher-Price that was ultimately dismissed.</p> \n  <p>The grandmother, Jan Hinson, of Greenville, S.C., says she looked at her grandson and saw he was &ldquo;cocked over all the way, and he was blue and lifeless. It was absolutely awful.&rdquo; She got the infant breathing again, and after a stay in the hospital, he was released.</p> \n  <p>Hinson, who is also a lawyer, is now representing a Virginia couple, Evan and Keenan Overton, whose son died while in a Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper.</p> \n  <p>A few days before Christmas in 2017, 5-month-old Ezra was asleep in the product while Keenan slept on a couch nearby. When Keenan woke in the middle of the night, he found Ezra on his stomach, unresponsive, and yelled for Evan to call 911. &ldquo;He was blue, and his body was, it was hard, and he didn&rsquo;t feel real,&rdquo; Evan said. Ezra was pronounced dead at the hospital; &ldquo;asphyxia&rdquo; was listed as the immediate cause of death. (The Overtons say Ezra was buckled in the sleeper, though the death certificate states the baby was unrestrained.)</p> \n  <figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b2b1b957e29caecbc21282a07f73f246/tumblr_inline_ppvcuwN6Z51thnhmz_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>In the days and weeks following the death, as the Overtons tried to make sense of what happened, they looked online and read about the Fisher-Price Rock &rsquo;n Play. The new parents had trusted that the product was safe for sleeping because that is how it is marketed. On the Fisher-Price website, the product is touted for &ldquo;naptime and nighttime,&rdquo; and the product&rsquo;s packaging says things such as &ldquo;Inclined sleeper designed for all-night sleep.&rdquo;</p> \n  <p>But the couple&rsquo;s internet searches revealed a different story. There were posts from parents and pediatricians describing the product as dangerous, prone to interfering with an infant&rsquo;s ability to breathe. The Overtons learned that though sudden infant deaths can occur with no clear cause&mdash;and there can be many factors involved&mdash;experts warned that this particular product, and infant inclined sleep products in general, pose an increased risk of infant death.</p> \n  <p>The Overtons had received their Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper as a hand-me-down from their neighbors, who had said that, when their child was an infant, the product had been a lifesaver. But, Keenan said, the Overtons became convinced that was &ldquo;the opposite of what it was.&rdquo;</p> \n  <p>On Jan. 6, 2018, Evan posted a review on Amazon warning parents about the product: &ldquo;I lost my son in this horrible contraption December 22 &hellip; this should not be marketed as a sleeper!&ldquo;</p> \n  <p>When asked by CR about the Overton incident, the company responded, &ldquo;The loss of a child is an unimaginable tragedy.&rdquo; Fisher-Price also confirmed that the Overtons&rsquo; case was one of the 10 cited by the company in the joint alert issued with the CPSC on April 5.</p> \n  <h2>History of a Dangerous Product</h2> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.fisher-price.com/en_US/ourstory/rock-n-play-sleeper/index.html\">Fisher-Price</a> says on its website that the company started developing the Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper when one of its designers had a baby boy who had trouble sleeping because of acid reflux. The designer&rsquo;s doctors suggested elevating the infant&rsquo;s head, prompting her and the company to create a sleeper that would keep her son at a 30-degree incline during sleep.</p> \n  <p>Fisher-Price told CR that it &ldquo;engaged a leading engineering and scientific consulting firm,&rdquo; which concluded that the &ldquo;Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper presents a lower risk of fatality than cribs and bassinets/cradles.&rdquo;<a href=\"https://www.fisher-price.com/en_US/ourstory/rock-n-play-sleeper/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p> \n  <p>Documents filed in an Atlanta lawsuit against Fisher-Price identified a medical consultant hired by the company to be Gary Deegear, M.D., a physician in San Antonio. According to these documents, he offered Fisher-Price assurance about the Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper&rsquo;s safety. For example, Kitty Pilarz&mdash;vice president of product safety and regulatory compliance for Mattel&mdash;wrote in one email: &ldquo;Dr. Deegear stated pediatricians recommend babies with reflux sleep at 30 degrees, this is just fine, or sleep in a car seat.&rdquo;</p> \n  <p>But there are several reasons to be concerned about this advice.</p> \n  <p>For one, Deegear is not a pediatrician or a sleep specialist, according to the Texas Medical Board, but was a family practice doctor. CR attempted to contact Deegear but could not reach him for comment.</p> \n  <p>For another, the AAP and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development have long counseled against letting infants sleep unsupervised in a reclined position.</p> \n  <p>Shortly after the recent joint alert from the CPSC and Fisher-Price, the AAP tweeted that &ldquo;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/healthychildren/status/1114279069120643073\" target=\"_blank\">The Rock &rsquo;n Play should not be used for routine sleep</a>; If you use the Rock &rsquo;n Play for soothing, always strap the baby in and never leave the baby unattended.&rdquo;</p> \n  <p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t recommend that babies are placed to sleep with their heads elevated because that is a position that would be subject to accidental suffocation [and] strangulation in bed,&rdquo; said Feldman-Winter of the AAP. Instead, the AAP says that for prolonged or nighttime sleep, babies should be put on their backs, unrestrained, alone, on a flat, firm surface, such as a mattress covered by a fitted sheet in a bare crib, bassinet, or play yard.</p> \n  <p>And, experts say, parents should never use a car seat, stroller, swing, sling, wedge, or any other similar product for unsupervised sleep.</p> \n  <p>That recommendation applies even to babies with acid reflux, Feldman-Winter said. She recognizes that some parents have heard that sleeping on an incline can ease that problem and understands the desperation parents can feel when a crying baby can&rsquo;t sleep. But &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no evidence to suggest that being on an incline is helpful for reflux,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There is a misconception that that&rsquo;s somehow an okay, safe sleep position, and it&rsquo;s just not.&rdquo;</p> \n  <p>The AAP also doesn&rsquo;t recommend for routine use sleeping devices that require the use of restraints because a baby could roll or turn into an unsafe position and be incapable of moving, leading to suffocation or strangulation.</p> \n  <p>That&rsquo;s one of the reasons experts <a href=\"https://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/cribs-are-for-sleeping,-car-seats-are-for-traveling-danger-in-using-sitting-and-carrying-devices-for-sleeping-infants\" target=\"_blank\">caution against using infant car seats for unsupervised sleep</a>. Those products are &ldquo;acceptable for shorter periods of time because it&rsquo;s the safest position for a crash,&rdquo; said Paul Gaudreau, a mechanical engineer who currently works for UPPAbaby and has experience in the car-seat industry. But, he said, <a href=\"https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(15)00345-5/pdf\" target=\"_blank\">research</a>&nbsp;(PDF) shows that a <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/Car-Seats-Lower-Oxygen-Levels-of-Newborns.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">baby&rsquo;s oxygen level can drop</a> when sleeping at an incline in a car seat. And medical experts warn that the straps can lead to strangulation. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve steered companies that I&rsquo;ve worked for away from doing inclined sleepers.&rdquo;</p> \n  <p>Finally, the basic advice&mdash;that babies should sleep on level, firm surfaces&mdash;dates back to 1994, well before Fisher-Price created its Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper. That&rsquo;s when the AAP and other groups introduced the <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/A-Parents-Guide-to-Safe-Sleep.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;Back to Sleep&rdquo; campaign</a> to reduce the risk of SIDS and other sleep-related causes of death. That <a href=\"https://safetosleep.nichd.nih.gov/activities/campaign\">campaign</a> (now called &ldquo;<a href=\"https://safetosleep.nichd.nih.gov/safesleepbasics/about\" target=\"_blank\">Safe to Sleep</a>&rdquo;) has helped cut the rate of SIDS by almost a half.</p> \n  <p>Roy Benaroch, M.D., an associate adjunct professor of pediatrics at Emory University in Atlanta, who has blogged about the safety risks of the Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper, told CR that parents are confused by the product at a time when they are especially vulnerable.</p> \n  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s tough because you don&rsquo;t sleep, the baby is not sleeping, parents are exhausted, and they&rsquo;re looking for a solution,&rdquo; he said. But &ldquo;parents are assuming a lot of risk by using this rather than following the safety guidelines.&rdquo; Bottom line: &ldquo;If you let your baby sleep in this thing, there&rsquo;s an increased risk of death,&rdquo; Benaroch said.</p> \n  <h2>Regulatory Side Steps</h2> \n  <p>When Fisher-Price first introduced the Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper, it marketed the product along with its bassinets. But less than a year later, in 2010, the CPSC began revising the standards for infant sleep surfaces, including bassinets, and issued a proposed rule that would require those products to be firm and flat, with an angle of 5 degrees or less when the product was at rest, rather than rocking or swinging.</p> \n  <p>Instead of adjusting the incline of its product, Pilarz, at Mattel, asked the CPSC for a revision to that proposed rule to account for products like the Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper. Not making that change, she said, could actually &ldquo;increase the risk of injury: Parents deprived of any appropriate product for calming their tired, colicky infants will look elsewhere&mdash;and substitute products dangerous for that purpose.&rdquo;</p> \n  <p>Ultimately, in October 2013, the CPSC excluded products with an incline of greater than 10 degrees from its mandatory bassinet and cradle standards.</p> \n  <p>Armed with that exclusion, Fisher-Price and other industry reps went to ASTM International&mdash;an organization that sets voluntary safety standards for consumer products and includes representatives from the government, industry, and the public&mdash;to finish a voluntary standard for a new category: inclined infant sleep products.</p> \n  <p>Some ASTM members had objected to creating a new category and standard for those products. &ldquo;By putting a standard in, you&rsquo;re telling people that &hellip; it must be safe,&rdquo; said Nancy Cowles, executive director of Kids in Danger, a nonprofit that focuses on reducing childhood injuries from consumer products. The voluntary ASTM standard, she worried, would create confusion for consumers and give new parents a false sense of security about a product that she felt was anything but secure.</p> \n  <p>Nevertheless, ASTM agreed to form a committee to develop a standard for the category. And they appointed Michael Steinwachs&mdash;one of the primary engineers at Fisher-Price involved in designing the Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper&mdash;chairperson of that committee. The voluntary standard for infant inclined sleep products was ultimately established in 2015.</p> \n  <p>Cowles, at KID, was disappointed but not surprised that the product category was established. &ldquo;You can talk safety till you&rsquo;re blue in the face, but if parents will buy them&mdash;and [the company] can always justify the incidents that happen as being the parents&rsquo; fault&mdash;then they&rsquo;re going to keep selling them,&rdquo; Cowles said.</p> \n  <h2>Warnings From Around the World</h2> \n  <p>Other health and regulatory agencies were not as easily sold on the infant inclined sleeper, according to documents in the Hidalgo County lawsuit.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>Around January 2011, Australian regulators, for example, wrote to Mattel, explaining why they did not think the item should be marketed as a sleep product. They said that the Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper &ldquo;is at odds with widely accepted and promoted best practices that these types of products should not be used as an infant bedding alternative.&rdquo; They also explained that because of the product&rsquo;s angle, &ldquo;babies&rsquo; heads can easily fall forward in a way that obstructs their airways.&rdquo; Fisher-Price confirmed it still does not sell the product in Australia.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>In Canada, the product is available&mdash;but was reclassified from a &ldquo;sleeper&rdquo; to a &ldquo;soother&rdquo; and is now marketed and sold as the Rock &rsquo;n Play Soothing Seat. This was because in February 2011 a representative from Health Canada wrote to Mattel Canada stating that public health officials there had concerns about the Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper &ldquo;in light of the Safe Sleep recommendations of Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada, and the Canadian Pediatric Society.&rdquo;</p> \n  <p>In the United Kingdom, the Rock &rsquo;n Play is for sale as a &ldquo;sleeper,&rdquo; despite misgivings from health organizations. In February 2011, the Royal College of Midwives in the U.K. told Fisher-Price that the product was suitable only for short periods of supervised play and that the group would not endorse the product as a sleeper. After receiving that news, a Fisher-Price employee wrote in an internal email, &ldquo;Please see attached the findings from the Royal College of Midwives testing on the sleeper. I&rsquo;m afraid the findings don&rsquo;t have good implications for a UK launch.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> \n  <h2>What Parents Should Do</h2> \n  <p>Given the number of injuries and deaths, consumer safety advocates question why neither Mattel nor the CPSC has yet initiated a recall.</p> \n  <p>&ldquo;In cases like these, where the product is on the market and there have been incidents associated with it, it&rsquo;s very difficult to understand why the enforcement agency with jurisdiction over this product wouldn&rsquo;t take action,&rdquo; said Rachel Weintraub, legislative director and general counsel of the Consumer Federation of America. &ldquo;When we know there are products that are posing risks and causing fatalities, that product in almost every case needs to be taken off the market.&rdquo;</p> \n  <p>The alert issued by the CPSC and Fisher-Price is inadequate, said Cowles of KID. She reiterated that children should not sleep restrained, and that children should sleep on flat surfaces, not inclines.</p> \n  <p>&ldquo;They should get rid of this product category,&rdquo; Cowles said. &ldquo;Anything intended for infant sleep should be flat. And then there should be specific recalls on the products that have been involved in deaths.&rdquo;</p> \n  <p>CR safety experts agree and recommend that anyone who currently has a Rock &rsquo;n Play Sleeper should immediately stop using it for routine sleep. Instead, babies should be put to <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/A-Parents-Guide-to-Safe-Sleep.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">bed</a>&nbsp;alone, on their backs, on a firm, flat mattress in a crib, bassinet, or play yard.</p>",

But since February of this year, I have finally begun to feel good again.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;I am starting to cultivate new relationships, reconnecting with old friends, and am finally able to put more energy into my work of dance and art making.</p><p>Thanks to these small miracles, I am able to have hope again.</p>",

It however seemed to have started triggering migraines like crazy ever since the outbreak. I went on a low carb diet by pure accident and it seemed to help the migraines, or so I thought and so I read up on it and I ended up on a keto diet. A keto diet had been super easy for me to follow but then I noticed I was still getting the migraines. Turned out that keto wasn&rsquo;t really taking it away so much as they are hormonal. So I get them twice a month. My neurologist actually thought I needed to come off my birth control&hellip; Bad idea bc then the migraines became EVERY SINGLE DAY! That led me to be put on migraine medication that said not to be on keto and take. I started then to add back some wheat crackers and bread and different foods. Boy, did I blow up. I looked 6mo pregnant and was so stopped up and no matter what I took I just could not go. Through all of this I&rsquo;ve had horrible joint pain, like my knees and wrists are so bad I can barely walk or pick up my 2 year old. I&rsquo;m only 34 but already have really bad arthritis and know keto was keeping that kinda at Bay. I can&rsquo;t keep my thoughts on one task at a time anymore and so tired with no energy. The last couple weeks I&rsquo;ve also had numb and tingly in my hands and feet if I do anything. Like I&rsquo;m on my feet for a while or if I&rsquo;m cleaning or anything with my hands. I stopped the meds for a fee days per Dr orders to see if that was it but I still had it and can&rsquo;t just stop the medicine for too long at a time without tapering off of it. I didn&rsquo;t have any of these side effects until I started trying to add back so of the carbs (mainly grains) I was dairy free and nut free towards the end of my keto days bc I thought they were triggering my migraines some too and I still don&rsquo;t think I do to great on them. Especially dairy. I get all red faced and nauseous. The migraines are now back to just hormonal time thanks to getting birth control back in my system. I just don&rsquo;t know where to go from here? Does it sound like I have some gluten issues? Should I try a Paleo diet? Whole 30? A certain version of Paleo? I&rsquo;m so lost and don&rsquo;t know where to turn. But this bloat has to go. I have a picture if anyone needs to see like if that would show what it could be. Please, I will do anything!
