Because, let\u2019s face it, if our dumb little idiot does anything to get the suit taken away from him again, he is going back to the old suit just like he did in Homecoming. But this time, he won\u2019t be without a little bit of guidance, and maybe a tracker and a direct connection to Tony should he do any super stupid again, because Karen is now also outfitted with a ping that goes straight to Tony at all times if Peter is in any kind of immediate danger again. Of course, after Pete protests that he can handle himself without Tony checking up on him, he\u2019ll watch from a distance and have Karen give him updates, but I just know that Tony refuses to let Peter do anything scary and stupid just by himself without a reality check, even if it means updating Karen to yell at him a bit.</p>",

It only makes sense they\u2019d do nice\nthings for each other. But there\u2019s nothing between them.\nReally.<br/><b>\nCreated For: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3-lxlL16h0AuMdy9GVa8lg\">@tonystarkbingo</a></b></p><hr><p>\nBucky\nwas playing paper football with Clint when Tony pushed into the\ncoffee shop, arms laden with thick books, as usual. Bucky felt a warm\nlittle spurt of fondness. Of all the friends Steve had made while\nBucky was deployed overseas, Tony was his favorite. Bucky waved, then\ndragged over a chair from another table.</p><p>\n\u201cThat\nstack must weigh almost as much as you,\u201d he said as Tony dropped\nthe books on the table with a relieved sigh.</p><p>\n\u201cJust\nabout,\u201d Tony agreed. \u201cBut they don\u2019t have ebook versions,\nso&hellip;\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I only need them for a few\ndays.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201c<i>Mechanical\nEngineering and Robotics</i>,\u201d\nSteve read off the spines. \u201c<i>Fundamentals\nof Robotics Design</i>.\nTony, what the heck? You took Fundamentals three semesters ago.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\nbut I thought I should brush up.\u201d He grinned and bounced in his\nseat with barely-suppressed excitement. \u201cI got that internship with\nFujikawa!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhat!\nTony, that\u2019s fantastic!\u201d Bucky said, amidst the others\u2019\ncongratulations. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna blow \u2018em away.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\nhope so,\u201d Tony said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s just an internship, I know I\nwon\u2019t be actually working on design or anything, but&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThey\u2019ll\nbe lucky to have you,\u201d Bucky promised.</p><p>\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\nTony opened one of the books and took out a small stack of pages held\ntogether with a paperclip. \u201cOf course, now I\u2019ve got to fill in\nall this new hire paperwork. Anyone got a pen I can borrow?\u201d</p><p>\nNatasha\nhad one, because she was prepared for everything, always.</p><p>\nBucky\nand Clint went back to their game while Tony muttered over the forms\nhe was filling out and Steve and Nat bickered good-naturedly about\nwhose turn it was to decide where their next date would be.</p><p>\n\u201cOh,\ndammit,\u201d Tony sighed. \u201cThey want an emergency contact number.\nThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m putting my parents on here.\u201d</p><p>\nTony\u2019s\nwealthy father had cut Tony off after they\u2019d fought over what Tony\nshould major in, among other things. In defiance, Tony had gotten\nloans and was finishing up his degree on his own terms. Bucky was\nridiculously proud of him. \u201cPut me down, doll,\u201d Bucky suggested.</p><p>\n\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSure,\u201d\nBucky said. \u201cI\u2019m mostly on night shift anyway, so I\u2019ll be\naround when you blow something up.\u201d</p><p>\nTony\nhuffed, but wrote Bucky\u2019s name and number on the form. \u201cRobotics\ndoesn\u2019t really involve a lot of explosions,\u201d he said. \u201cMore\u2019s\nthe pity.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOkay,\nso when you accidentally create an evil robot that\u2019s bent on\ndestroying the world,\u201d Bucky amended. Tony laughed, and Bucky\nruffled his hair.</p><p><b><i>[\u2019ware the readmore!]</i></b></p><!-- more --><hr><p>\nTony\npushed open the door to Bucky\u2019s apartment. Bucky had given him a\nkey when it had come up that Bucky\u2019s apartment was closer to the\nFujikawa office than the fourth-floor walkup that Tony split with\nClint and Pietro. \u201cThat way you\u2019ve got a place to stash your\nbooks an\u2019 stuff so you don\u2019t gotta lug \u2018em all that way,\u201d\nBucky had said.</p><p>\nIt\nwas handy; Tony kept a couple of changes of clothes at Bucky\u2019s,\ntoo, in case he had to work late and crash on Bucky\u2019s couch. And\nBucky had given him space in the fridge, too, so Tony could eat\ndinner there before taking the subway back to his own apartment. They\noften ate together, in fact &ndash; Tony\u2019s dinner was Bucky\u2019s\nbreakfast.</p><p>\nBucky\nwas in the kitchen already when Tony came in, humming tunelessly as\nhe made a mess of the eggs in his frying pan. He looked up with a\nbright smile when Tony came in. \u201cHeya, dollface! Good day?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\nactually,\u201d Tony said. \u201cI found a little flaw in the design I was\nproofreading, and my boss said I probably saved the company a couple\nof months on the project and a shit-ton of money.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThat\u2019s\ngreat!\u201d Bucky said. He threw his arm around Tony\u2019s shoulders and\nsqueezed him in a quick hug before going back to his eggs. \u201cWe\nshould go out to celebrate.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSpeaking\nof celebration,\u201d Tony said, \u201cyour birthday is coming up. You\ngoing to let me plan a party?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhat?\nYou don\u2019t gotta go to any trouble for me,\u201d Bucky said.</p><p>\nTony\nglared at him. \u201cIt\u2019s not trouble if I <i>want</i>\nto\ndo it. C\u2019mon, it\u2019s the first birthday you\u2019ve had since you came\nback stateside. Let us take you out and have some fun!\u201d</p><p>\nBucky\nmade a face like he was going to argue, and Tony turned on the pout.\nBucky could never resist Tony\u2019s pout.</p><p>\n\u201cFine,\nokay,\u201d Bucky sighed. His mouth twitched like he was trying to\nsuppress a smile. \u201cNothin\u2019 too crazy, though, okay? It\u2019s just a\nbirthday, don\u2019t really mean nothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\npromise,\u201d Tony lied cheerfully, and whipped out his phone.\n\u201cCancelling the hunky male strippers now.\u201d</p><p>\nBucky\nlaughed. \u201cNah, you might as well keep those,\u201d he said. \u201cMakin\u2019\nStevie blush is the best present you could give me, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\n(\u201cOh\nmy <i>god</i>,\u201d\nBucky said, three weeks later. \u201cI thought you were <i>kidding</i>\nabout\nthe strippers!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBuck,\nI <i>never</i>\nkid\nabout strippers,\u201d Tony said solemnly. He\u2019d had to badger Clint\nand Bruce and Natasha into helping him pay for it, but it was totally\nworth it for the way Bucky\u2019s eyes had bugged out and the blush that\nclimbed up out of Bucky\u2019s collar.</p><p>\n\u201cBest\nbirthday ever.\u201d)</p><hr><p>\nSteve\nand Natasha were completely disgusting together pretty much all the\ntime, but for Valentine\u2019s Day, they took it to new heights. \u201cUg,\nget a <i>room</i>,\u201d\nBucky complained.</p><p>\n\u201cOr,\u201d\nClint suggested with a practiced leer, \u201cput on a show.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou\nhave a boyfriend,\u201d Bucky reminded him.</p><p>\n\u201cIt\u2019s\nokay, I\u2019ll film it for him.\u201d Clint thumbed on his phone and\nturned on the photo app.</p><p>\n\u201cGross.\nStevie, what the hell happened to the <i>evils\nof the industrial marketing complex</i>,\nhuh?\u201d</p><p>\nSteve\nmanaged to tear his gaze away from Natasha. \u201cI guess when you\u2019re\nthis much in love, you\u2019ll take any excuse to show it.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOh\n<i>gag</i>\nme,\u201d\nBucky whined.</p><p>\n\u201cKinky,\u201d\nsaid Tony in his ear. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even gotten to third base yet.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cJesus!\u201d\nBucky jumped. \u201cWhere\u2019d you come from?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cJust\ngot here.\u201d Tony dragged out a chair and dropped into it, then\ntossed a package into Bucky\u2019s lap.</p><p>\n\u201cWhat\u2019s\nthis?\u201d Bucky picked the box up and turned it over.</p><p>\n\u201cHappy\nValentine\u2019s Day,\u201d Tony said. \u201cThe bodega on Seventh already has\ntheir chocolate on\npost-holiday markdown.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNice!\u201d\nIf Bucky was going to have to watch his paired-off friends being all\nsappy and cute with each other all day while Bucky was single, it was\nnice to have consolation chocolate to go with it. \u201cBut don\u2019t\nthink this means I\u2019m putting out.\u201d</p><hr><p>\n\u201cWhat\nabout this one?\u201d</p><p>\nBucky\nleaned over Tony\u2019s shoulder to read the Craigslist ad. \u201cI dunno,\nthis guy sounds like a creeper.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThey\n<i>all</i>\nsound\nlike creepers,\u201d Tony pointed out. \u201cIt\u2019s a roommate-wanted ad.\u201d</p><p>\nBucky\nchewed on his lip. He could appreciate Tony wanting to move out of\nClint and Pietro\u2019s apartment to give the two their privacy, but he\ndidn\u2019t like the idea of Tony living with a stranger. Especially not\nwith the creeps and drug dealers that seemed to be all Tony was\nfinding on Craigslist.</p><p>\nFuck\nit. \u201cYou could always move in with me,\u201d he said. Bucky\u2019s\napartment was small, but he had it to himself.</p><p>\nTony\ngave him a wide-eyed look. \u201cI already impose on you enough.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNah.\nHalf your stuff is at my place anyway, you might as well just bring\nthe rest.\u201d</p><p>\nTony\nrubbed at the spot on his chest that meant he was considering it.\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\u201d\nBucky said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go back to night shift, but losing\nthe pay differential kinda sucked. Little help with the rent and\nbills would be nice, honestly.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019m\ngraduating next semester,\u201d Tony reminded him. \u201cOnce I get a real\njob, I can help out a lot more.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBet\nFujikawa\u2019s gonna snap you right up,\u201d Bucky said. \u201cThey keep\nre-upping your internship. They know you\u2019re a keeper.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOkay,\u201d\nTony said. \u201cYeah, we can make that work. I bet Clint and Piet will\nbe relieved to have the place to themselves, finally.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cEveryone\nwins,\u201d Bucky agreed.</p><hr><p>\nTony\nheard the door open, but didn\u2019t look up from his homework. \u201cWelcome\nhome, snugglebug.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cHey\nthere, shmoopsie,\u201d Bucky shot back. The ridiculous pet names had\nstarted as mockery of Steve and Nat, and then turned into their own\nprivate joke. \u201cAnything interesting happen today?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cRhodey\nnearly had a nervous breakdown in the computer lab when the printer\nran out of paper and the IT guy said they wouldn\u2019t be around to\nrefill it until tomorrow,\u201d Tony reported. \u201cBut I told him I\u2019d\nprint his paper here and drop it off when we meet up for drinks\nlater. That okay?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAs\nlong as it\u2019s not a hundred-pager,\u201d Bucky agreed.</p><p>\n\u201cNah,\njust twelve.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNo\nworries, then.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOh,\nand we got our invitation to Steve and Nat\u2019s wedding in the mail,\u201d\nTony said. He pointed at the table that was more of a dumping ground\nthan a useful surface. \u201cSingular invitation. One of them, for both\nof us.\u201d</p><p>\nBucky\nsnorted as he picked it up and turned it over. \u201cFancy,\u201d he\ncommented. \u201cWhat, no \u2018and Guest\u2019 for either of us?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSteve\ndid say they were trying to keep it small and intimate,\u201d Tony\npointed out. \u201cIf either of us were dating anyone, they\u2019d already\nknow about it.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThey\ndidn\u2019t have to send us an invitation at all,\u201d Bucky said. \u201cSeeing\nas we\u2019re both in the wedding party.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\nthink that\u2019s just so we can mark our dinner preference,\u201d Tony\nsaid. He squinted at his homework, erased a line of math, and\nreworked it.</p><p>\n\u201cOh,\nyeah, here\u2019s the card. Oh, you already filled it out for us. How\u2019d\nyou know I\u2019d want the chicken?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBecause\nyou only like steak if it\u2019s still bleeding, and there\u2019s no way to\nget real rare steak from a catering venue.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou\nknow me so well.\u201d Bucky messed up Tony\u2019s hair on his way past.\n\u201cGuess you\u2019ll be an okay date.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\nhope I catch the bouquet,\u201d Tony quipped. \u201cThen you\u2019ll <i>have</i>\nto\nmarry me.\u201d</p><hr><p>\nBucky\nsnared Steve\u2019s elbow and drew him aside. \u201cStevie. I hate to be a\nwet blanket at your own rehearsal dinner, but&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhat\u2019s\nwrong, Buck?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThe\nroom you got for me an\u2019 Tony&hellip; Look, I\u2019m <i>super</i>\ngrateful\nto you guys for putting us up, but there was some kind of mix-up with\nthe hotel, an\u2019 they said they can\u2019t change it without your say-so\n\u2018cause it\u2019s on your credit card.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOh.\u201d\nSteve looked relieved. \u201cIs that all? We can swing by the front desk\nand do that. What\u2019s wrong with the room?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIt\u2019s\nonly got one bed.\u201d</p><p>\nSteve\nhesitated. \u201cThat\u2019s&hellip; that\u2019s a problem?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhat\ndo you&ndash; of <i>course</i>\nit\u2019s\na problem!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSorry,\nBuck,\u201d Steve said, his eyes wide. \u201cI didn\u2019t know. You guys have\nbeen together so long, I just assumed&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWait,\u201d\nBucky said. \u201cWait wait wait. What do you mean, together? You mean\n<i>Tony\nand me</i>?\nLike, <i>together</i>,\ntogether?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWell&hellip;\nyeah?\u201d Steve blinked. \u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOf\ncourse we\u2019re not!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhat\ndo you mean, \u2018of course\u2019? You an\u2019 Tony have been living in each\nother\u2019s pockets for like&hellip; two <i>years</i>\nnow.\nHe moved in with you!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThat\u2019s\nno different than when he was livin\u2019 with Clint and Pietro! It\nain\u2019t like we\u2019re suckin\u2019 face everywhere!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWe\njust figured you weren\u2019t all that demonstrative in public. Besides,\nyou flirt with each other all the time,\u201d added Steve.</p><p>\n\u201cIt\u2019s\na <i>joke</i>.\u201d</p><p>\nSteve\nput his hand on Bucky\u2019s shoulder and looked at him gravely. \u201cIs\nit?\u201d</p><p>\nBucky\u2019s\nmouth fell open, but no protest came out. Over Steve\u2019s shoulder,\nBucky could see Tony, laughing as he thumb-wrestled with Pietro over\nthe last slice of bread. Bucky caught himself smiling fondly, and\nSteve patted his shoulder. \u201cMaybe not as much of a joke as you\nthink, pal,\u201d Steve said. The jerk.</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019ll&hellip;\nget back to you on that room thing,\u201d Bucky said, unable to tear his\neyes away from Tony.</p><p>\n\u201cYou\ndo that, Buck.\u201d And Steve was gone.</p><p>\nShit.\n<i>Shit</i>.\nHow had he never realized&hellip; All their friends thought they were\ndating? Had been, for&hellip; for <i>years</i>.</p><p>\nAnd\nsure, they lived together. They went everywhere together, but that\nwas just convenience. It was nice, having company when you were out\nrunning errands. It was good sense not to wander the city alone, too,\nespecially when you\u2019d been out having a good time.</p><p>\nAnd\nokay, neither of them had gone on any dates in the last couple of\nyears, either, but that was because Tony was focused on his studies\nand his internship and Bucky was&hellip;</p><p>\nWas&hellip;</p><p>\nOh,\n<i>fuck</i>,\nwas he in love with Tony?</p><p>\nHow\nlong had <i>that</i>\nbeen\ngoing on?</p><hr><p>\n\u201cNo\ndice with the room?\u201d Tony asked when Bucky came back to the table.\nIt was fine, Tony had figured there was a possibility that the\nhotel\u2019s double bed rooms had already been booked. They could share\na bed for two nights; it wouldn\u2019t be that much of an imposition.</p><p>\n\u201cUh.\nThere\u2019s sort of a&hellip; thing,\u201d Bucky said. He looked a little pale.</p><p>\n\u201cHey,\nyou okay?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhat?\nYeah. Yeah, I\u2019m just&hellip;\u201d Bucky looked up and down the table, then\ntook a deep breath, as if steeling himself for something. \u201cCome an\u2019\ntake a little walk with me?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSure,\u201d\nTony said, pushing his chair back. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\u201d\nBucky said, leading Tony away from the noise and down a side hall. \u201cI\njust&hellip; Um.\u201d When the rehearsal party was out of sight and almost\nout of earshot, Bucky stopped and leaned against the wall. \u201cSo&hellip;\nthe reason we got that room,\u201d he said, eyes on the peeling\nwallpaper, \u201cis \u2018cause apparently everyone thinks we\u2019re. Y\u2019know.\nTogether.\u201d</p><p>\nTony\nblinked. Then blinked again. \u201cYou mean <i>together</i>,\ntogether?\u201d</p><p>\nBucky\nhuffed out a little laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s \u2018xactly what I said.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOh\nmy god,\u201d Tony said. \u201cWhy the hell would they&ndash;\u201d Except it made\nperfect sense, didn\u2019t it, if you were on the outside, looking in.\nBucky and Tony spent all their time together. They flirted. They gave\neach other gifts. They spent their holidays together. They gave each\nother Valentine\u2019s gifts and planned each other\u2019s birthday\nparties. They were each other\u2019s emergency contacts, for fuck\u2019s\nsake. \u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\u201d\nBucky said.</p><p>\nTony\nwas beginning to understand why Bucky looked so poleaxed. It wasn\u2019t\nlike he\u2019d never thought about it &ndash; Bucky was one damned fine\nlooking man, after all. But he\u2019d never taken it seriously. Bucky\nwas not just gorgeous but smart and brave and funny and kind, and\nTony was lucky enough just being Bucky\u2019s friend. But apparently\ntheir friends thought there was more there. And he couldn\u2019t help\nbut understand why. \u201cWe\u2019ve been dating all this time, and didn\u2019t\nrealize it,\u201d Tony said.</p><p>\n\u201cI\nguess so.\u201d</p><p>\nBucky\nglanced up, and Tony was arrested by the look in Bucky\u2019s eyes.\nLonging and hungry. Bucky\u2019s eyes dropped, but only to Tony\u2019s\nmouth and neck, and Bucky licked his lips, let his teeth drag over\nhis bottom lip.</p><p>\nOh.\n<i>Oh</i>.\nBucky&hellip; <i>wanted</i>\nthat?</p><p>\nWith\nTony?</p><p>\nTony\u2019s\nbreath hitched and Bucky\u2019s eyes snapped back up to meet Tony\u2019s\ngaze.</p><p>\nTony\nswallowed. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice bed,\u201d he said cautiously.</p><p>\nBucky\nnodded slowly. \u201cLooked very nice. Big. Comfy. And it\u2019d be a real\nhassle to make the hotel change our room now. It\u2019s getting late,\nand all.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThat\u2019s\ntrue,\u201d Tony agreed. \u201cMaybe we should just keep it.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWe\n<i>are</i>\nhere\ntogether,\u201d Bucky pointed out. \u201cThe invitation said.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cHang\non, I want to try something,\u201d Tony said. Bucky stared at him, and\nTony leaned in, felt the soft rush of air as Bucky sucked in a\nbreath. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\nBucky\nnodded, and Tony leaned in a little closer to brush his lips against\nBucky\u2019s once, twice, a third time.</p><p>\nThen\nBucky\u2019s hand curled around Tony\u2019s neck, fingers pushing through\nTony\u2019s hair, and pulled him in for another, deeper kiss. Tony\u2019s\nstomach filled with butterflies and a rush of heat flooded Tony\u2019s\nbody. \u201cOh god,\u201d he croaked.</p><p>\nBucky\nreached for Tony\u2019s hand, lacing their fingers together, then\nglanced at Tony shyly. \u201cOkay? If they see? If they know?\u201d</p><p>\nTony\ngrinned. \u201cHoney, apparently we\u2019re the only idiots who <i>didn\u2019t</i>\nknow.\u201d\nHe squeezed Bucky\u2019s hand tighter. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go back to\ndinner and make everyone sick at how sappy we are.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSteve\nand Nat have it coming,\u201d Bucky agreed. \u201cAnd then after dinner&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAfter\ndinner,\u201d Tony said, thrilling at the thought, \u201cwe\u2019ll go back to\nour room and take advantage of that very nice bed.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><b>~fin.</b></p>",

Anyone got a pen I can borrow?\u201d</p><p>\nNatasha\nhad one, because she was prepared for everything, always.</p><p>\nBucky\nand Clint went back to their game while Tony muttered over the forms\nhe was filling out and Steve and Nat bickered good-naturedly about\nwhose turn it was to decide where their next date would be.</p><p>\n\u201cOh,\ndammit,\u201d Tony sighed. \u201cThey want an emergency contact number.\nThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m putting my parents on here.\u201d</p><p>\nTony\u2019s\nwealthy father had cut Tony off after they\u2019d fought over what Tony\nshould major in, among other things. In defiance, Tony had gotten\nloans and was finishing up his degree on his own terms. Bucky was\nridiculously proud of him. \u201cPut me down, doll,\u201d Bucky suggested.</p><p>\n\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSure,\u201d\nBucky said. \u201cI\u2019m mostly on night shift anyway, so I\u2019ll be\naround when you blow something up.\u201d</p><p>\nTony\nhuffed, but wrote Bucky\u2019s name and number on the form. \u201cRobotics\ndoesn\u2019t really involve a lot of explosions,\u201d he said. \u201cMore\u2019s\nthe pity.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOkay,\nso when you accidentally create an evil robot that\u2019s bent on\ndestroying the world,\u201d Bucky amended. Tony laughed, and Bucky\nruffled his hair.</p><p><b><i>[\u2019ware the readmore!]</i></b></p>[[MORE]]<hr><p>\nTony\npushed open the door to Bucky\u2019s apartment. Bucky had given him a\nkey when it had come up that Bucky\u2019s apartment was closer to the\nFujikawa office than the fourth-floor walkup that Tony split with\nClint and Pietro. \u201cThat way you\u2019ve got a place to stash your\nbooks an\u2019 stuff so you don\u2019t gotta lug \u2018em all that way,\u201d\nBucky had said.</p><p>\nIt\nwas handy; Tony kept a couple of changes of clothes at Bucky\u2019s,\ntoo, in case he had to work late and crash on Bucky\u2019s couch. And\nBucky had given him space in the fridge, too, so Tony could eat\ndinner there before taking the subway back to his own apartment. They\noften ate together, in fact \u2013 Tony\u2019s dinner was Bucky\u2019s\nbreakfast.</p><p>\nBucky\nwas in the kitchen already when Tony came in, humming tunelessly as\nhe made a mess of the eggs in his frying pan. He looked up with a\nbright smile when Tony came in. \u201cHeya, dollface! Good day?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\nactually,\u201d Tony said. \u201cI found a little flaw in the design I was\nproofreading, and my boss said I probably saved the company a couple\nof months on the project and a shit-ton of money.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThat\u2019s\ngreat!\u201d Bucky said. He threw his arm around Tony\u2019s shoulders and\nsqueezed him in a quick hug before going back to his eggs. \u201cWe\nshould go out to celebrate.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSpeaking\nof celebration,\u201d Tony said, \u201cyour birthday is coming up. You\ngoing to let me plan a party?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhat?\nYou don\u2019t gotta go to any trouble for me,\u201d Bucky said.</p><p>\nTony\nglared at him. \u201cIt\u2019s not trouble if I <i>want</i>\nto\ndo it. C\u2019mon, it\u2019s the first birthday you\u2019ve had since you came\nback stateside. Let us take you out and have some fun!\u201d</p><p>\nBucky\nmade a face like he was going to argue, and Tony turned on the pout.\nBucky could never resist Tony\u2019s pout.</p><p>\n\u201cFine,\nokay,\u201d Bucky sighed. His mouth twitched like he was trying to\nsuppress a smile. \u201cNothin\u2019 too crazy, though, okay? It\u2019s just a\nbirthday, don\u2019t really mean nothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\npromise,\u201d Tony lied cheerfully, and whipped out his phone.\n\u201cCancelling the hunky male strippers now.\u201d</p><p>\nBucky\nlaughed. \u201cNah, you might as well keep those,\u201d he said. \u201cMakin\u2019\nStevie blush is the best present you could give me, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\n(\u201cOh\nmy <i>god</i>,\u201d\nBucky said, three weeks later. \u201cI thought you were <i>kidding</i>\nabout\nthe strippers!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBuck,\nI <i>never</i>\nkid\nabout strippers,\u201d Tony said solemnly. He\u2019d had to badger Clint\nand Bruce and Natasha into helping him pay for it, but it was totally\nworth it for the way Bucky\u2019s eyes had bugged out and the blush that\nclimbed up out of Bucky\u2019s collar.</p><p>\n\u201cBest\nbirthday ever.\u201d)</p><hr><p>\nSteve\nand Natasha were completely disgusting together pretty much all the\ntime, but for Valentine\u2019s Day, they took it to new heights. \u201cUg,\nget a <i>room</i>,\u201d\nBucky complained.</p><p>\n\u201cOr,\u201d\nClint suggested with a practiced leer, \u201cput on a show.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou\nhave a boyfriend,\u201d Bucky reminded him.</p><p>\n\u201cIt\u2019s\nokay, I\u2019ll film it for him.\u201d Clint thumbed on his phone and\nturned on the photo app.</p><p>\n\u201cGross.\nStevie, what the hell happened to the <i>evils\nof the industrial marketing complex</i>,\nhuh?\u201d</p><p>\nSteve\nmanaged to tear his gaze away from Natasha. \u201cI guess when you\u2019re\nthis much in love, you\u2019ll take any excuse to show it.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOh\n<i>gag</i>\nme,\u201d\nBucky whined.</p><p>\n\u201cKinky,\u201d\nsaid Tony in his ear. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even gotten to third base yet.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cJesus!\u201d\nBucky jumped. \u201cWhere\u2019d you come from?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cJust\ngot here.\u201d Tony dragged out a chair and dropped into it, then\ntossed a package into Bucky\u2019s lap.</p><p>\n\u201cWhat\u2019s\nthis?\u201d Bucky picked the box up and turned it over.</p><p>\n\u201cHappy\nValentine\u2019s Day,\u201d Tony said. \u201cThe bodega on Seventh already has\ntheir chocolate on\npost-holiday markdown.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNice!\u201d\nIf Bucky was going to have to watch his paired-off friends being all\nsappy and cute with each other all day while Bucky was single, it was\nnice to have consolation chocolate to go with it. \u201cBut don\u2019t\nthink this means I\u2019m putting out.\u201d</p><hr><p>\n\u201cWhat\nabout this one?\u201d</p><p>\nBucky\nleaned over Tony\u2019s shoulder to read the Craigslist ad. \u201cI dunno,\nthis guy sounds like a creeper.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThey\n<i>all</i>\nsound\nlike creepers,\u201d Tony pointed out. \u201cIt\u2019s a roommate-wanted ad.\u201d</p><p>\nBucky\nchewed on his lip. He could appreciate Tony wanting to move out of\nClint and Pietro\u2019s apartment to give the two their privacy, but he\ndidn\u2019t like the idea of Tony living with a stranger. Especially not\nwith the creeps and drug dealers that seemed to be all Tony was\nfinding on Craigslist.</p><p>\nFuck\nit. \u201cYou could always move in with me,\u201d he said. Bucky\u2019s\napartment was small, but he had it to himself.</p><p>\nTony\ngave him a wide-eyed look. \u201cI already impose on you enough.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNah.\nHalf your stuff is at my place anyway, you might as well just bring\nthe rest.\u201d</p><p>\nTony\nrubbed at the spot on his chest that meant he was considering it.\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\u201d\nBucky said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go back to night shift, but losing\nthe pay differential kinda sucked. Little help with the rent and\nbills would be nice, honestly.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019m\ngraduating next semester,\u201d Tony reminded him. \u201cOnce I get a real\njob, I can help out a lot more.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBet\nFujikawa\u2019s gonna snap you right up,\u201d Bucky said. \u201cThey keep\nre-upping your internship. They know you\u2019re a keeper.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOkay,\u201d\nTony said. \u201cYeah, we can make that work. I bet Clint and Piet will\nbe relieved to have the place to themselves, finally.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cEveryone\nwins,\u201d Bucky agreed.</p><hr><p>\nTony\nheard the door open, but didn\u2019t look up from his homework. \u201cWelcome\nhome, snugglebug.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cHey\nthere, shmoopsie,\u201d Bucky shot back. The ridiculous pet names had\nstarted as mockery of Steve and Nat, and then turned into their own\nprivate joke. \u201cAnything interesting happen today?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cRhodey\nnearly had a nervous breakdown in the computer lab when the printer\nran out of paper and the IT guy said they wouldn\u2019t be around to\nrefill it until tomorrow,\u201d Tony reported. \u201cBut I told him I\u2019d\nprint his paper here and drop it off when we meet up for drinks\nlater. That okay?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAs\nlong as it\u2019s not a hundred-pager,\u201d Bucky agreed.</p><p>\n\u201cNah,\njust twelve.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNo\nworries, then.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOh,\nand we got our invitation to Steve and Nat\u2019s wedding in the mail,\u201d\nTony said. He pointed at the table that was more of a dumping ground\nthan a useful surface. \u201cSingular invitation. One of them, for both\nof us.\u201d</p><p>\nBucky\nsnorted as he picked it up and turned it over. \u201cFancy,\u201d he\ncommented. \u201cWhat, no \u2018and Guest\u2019 for either of us?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSteve\ndid say they were trying to keep it small and intimate,\u201d Tony\npointed out. \u201cIf either of us were dating anyone, they\u2019d already\nknow about it.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThey\ndidn\u2019t have to send us an invitation at all,\u201d Bucky said. \u201cSeeing\nas we\u2019re both in the wedding party.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\nthink that\u2019s just so we can mark our dinner preference,\u201d Tony\nsaid. He squinted at his homework, erased a line of math, and\nreworked it.</p><p>\n\u201cOh,\nyeah, here\u2019s the card. Oh, you already filled it out for us. How\u2019d\nyou know I\u2019d want the chicken?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBecause\nyou only like steak if it\u2019s still bleeding, and there\u2019s no way to\nget real rare steak from a catering venue.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou\nknow me so well.\u201d Bucky messed up Tony\u2019s hair on his way past.\n\u201cGuess you\u2019ll be an okay date.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\nhope I catch the bouquet,\u201d Tony quipped. \u201cThen you\u2019ll <i>have</i>\nto\nmarry me.\u201d</p><hr><p>\nBucky\nsnared Steve\u2019s elbow and drew him aside. \u201cStevie. I hate to be a\nwet blanket at your own rehearsal dinner, but\u2026\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhat\u2019s\nwrong, Buck?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThe\nroom you got for me an\u2019 Tony\u2026 Look, I\u2019m <i>super</i>\ngrateful\nto you guys for putting us up, but there was some kind of mix-up with\nthe hotel, an\u2019 they said they can\u2019t change it without your say-so\n\u2018cause it\u2019s on your credit card.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOh.\u201d\nSteve looked relieved. \u201cIs that all? We can swing by the front desk\nand do that. What\u2019s wrong with the room?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIt\u2019s\nonly got one bed.\u201d</p><p>\nSteve\nhesitated. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s a problem?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhat\ndo you\u2013 of <i>course</i>\nit\u2019s\na problem!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSorry,\nBuck,\u201d Steve said, his eyes wide. \u201cI didn\u2019t know. You guys have\nbeen together so long, I just assumed\u2013\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWait,\u201d\nBucky said. \u201cWait wait wait. What do you mean, together? You mean\n<i>Tony\nand me</i>?\nLike, <i>together</i>,\ntogether?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWell\u2026\nyeah?\u201d Steve blinked. \u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOf\ncourse we\u2019re not!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhat\ndo you mean, \u2018of course\u2019? You an\u2019 Tony have been living in each\nother\u2019s pockets for like\u2026 two <i>years</i>\nnow.\nHe moved in with you!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThat\u2019s\nno different than when he was livin\u2019 with Clint and Pietro! It\nain\u2019t like we\u2019re suckin\u2019 face everywhere!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWe\njust figured you weren\u2019t all that demonstrative in public. Besides,\nyou flirt with each other all the time,\u201d added Steve.</p><p>\n\u201cIt\u2019s\na <i>joke</i>.\u201d</p><p>\nSteve\nput his hand on Bucky\u2019s shoulder and looked at him gravely. \u201cIs\nit?\u201d</p><p>\nBucky\u2019s\nmouth fell open, but no protest came out. Over Steve\u2019s shoulder,\nBucky could see Tony, laughing as he thumb-wrestled with Pietro over\nthe last slice of bread. Bucky caught himself smiling fondly, and\nSteve patted his shoulder. \u201cMaybe not as much of a joke as you\nthink, pal,\u201d Steve said. The jerk.</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019ll\u2026\nget back to you on that room thing,\u201d Bucky said, unable to tear his\neyes away from Tony.</p><p>\n\u201cYou\ndo that, Buck.\u201d And Steve was gone.</p><p>\nShit.\n<i>Shit</i>.\nHow had he never realized\u2026 All their friends thought they were\ndating? Had been, for\u2026 for <i>years</i>.</p><p>\nAnd\nsure, they lived together. They went everywhere together, but that\nwas just convenience. It was nice, having company when you were out\nrunning errands. It was good sense not to wander the city alone, too,\nespecially when you\u2019d been out having a good time.</p><p>\nAnd\nokay, neither of them had gone on any dates in the last couple of\nyears, either, but that was because Tony was focused on his studies\nand his internship and Bucky was\u2026</p><p>\nWas\u2026</p><p>\nOh,\n<i>fuck</i>,\nwas he in love with Tony?</p><p>\nHow\nlong had <i>that</i>\nbeen\ngoing on?</p><hr><p>\n\u201cNo\ndice with the room?\u201d Tony asked when Bucky came back to the table.\nIt was fine, Tony had figured there was a possibility that the\nhotel\u2019s double bed rooms had already been booked. They could share\na bed for two nights; it wouldn\u2019t be that much of an imposition.</p><p>\n\u201cUh.\nThere\u2019s sort of a\u2026 thing,\u201d Bucky said. He looked a little pale.</p><p>\n\u201cHey,\nyou okay?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhat?\nYeah. Yeah, I\u2019m just\u2026\u201d Bucky looked up and down the table, then\ntook a deep breath, as if steeling himself for something. \u201cCome an\u2019\ntake a little walk with me?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSure,\u201d\nTony said, pushing his chair back. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\u201d\nBucky said, leading Tony away from the noise and down a side hall. \u201cI\njust\u2026 Um.\u201d When the rehearsal party was out of sight and almost\nout of earshot, Bucky stopped and leaned against the wall. \u201cSo\u2026\nthe reason we got that room,\u201d he said, eyes on the peeling\nwallpaper, \u201cis \u2018cause apparently everyone thinks we\u2019re. Y\u2019know.\nTogether.\u201d</p><p>\nTony\nblinked. Then blinked again. \u201cYou mean <i>together</i>,\ntogether?\u201d</p><p>\nBucky\nhuffed out a little laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s \u2018xactly what I said.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOh\nmy god,\u201d Tony said. \u201cWhy the hell would they\u2013\u201d Except it made\nperfect sense, didn\u2019t it, if you were on the outside, looking in.\nBucky and Tony spent all their time together. They flirted. They gave\neach other gifts. They spent their holidays together. They gave each\nother Valentine\u2019s gifts and planned each other\u2019s birthday\nparties. They were each other\u2019s emergency contacts, for fuck\u2019s\nsake. \u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\u201d\nBucky said.</p><p>\nTony\nwas beginning to understand why Bucky looked so poleaxed. It wasn\u2019t\nlike he\u2019d never thought about it \u2013 Bucky was one damned fine\nlooking man, after all. But he\u2019d never taken it seriously. Bucky\nwas not just gorgeous but smart and brave and funny and kind, and\nTony was lucky enough just being Bucky\u2019s friend. But apparently\ntheir friends thought there was more there. And he couldn\u2019t help\nbut understand why. \u201cWe\u2019ve been dating all this time, and didn\u2019t\nrealize it,\u201d Tony said.</p><p>\n\u201cI\nguess so.\u201d</p><p>\nBucky\nglanced up, and Tony was arrested by the look in Bucky\u2019s eyes.\nLonging and hungry. Bucky\u2019s eyes dropped, but only to Tony\u2019s\nmouth and neck, and Bucky licked his lips, let his teeth drag over\nhis bottom lip.</p><p>\nOh.\n<i>Oh</i>.\nBucky\u2026 <i>wanted</i>\nthat?</p><p>\nWith\nTony?</p><p>\nTony\u2019s\nbreath hitched and Bucky\u2019s eyes snapped back up to meet Tony\u2019s\ngaze.</p><p>\nTony\nswallowed. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice bed,\u201d he said cautiously.</p><p>\nBucky\nnodded slowly. \u201cLooked very nice. Big. Comfy. And it\u2019d be a real\nhassle to make the hotel change our room now. It\u2019s getting late,\nand all.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThat\u2019s\ntrue,\u201d Tony agreed. \u201cMaybe we should just keep it.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWe\n<i>are</i>\nhere\ntogether,\u201d Bucky pointed out. \u201cThe invitation said.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cHang\non, I want to try something,\u201d Tony said. Bucky stared at him, and\nTony leaned in, felt the soft rush of air as Bucky sucked in a\nbreath. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\nBucky\nnodded, and Tony leaned in a little closer to brush his lips against\nBucky\u2019s once, twice, a third time.</p><p>\nThen\nBucky\u2019s hand curled around Tony\u2019s neck, fingers pushing through\nTony\u2019s hair, and pulled him in for another, deeper kiss. Tony\u2019s\nstomach filled with butterflies and a rush of heat flooded Tony\u2019s\nbody. \u201cOh god,\u201d he croaked.</p><p>\nBucky\nreached for Tony\u2019s hand, lacing their fingers together, then\nglanced at Tony shyly. \u201cOkay? If they see? If they know?\u201d</p><p>\nTony\ngrinned. \u201cHoney, apparently we\u2019re the only idiots who <i>didn\u2019t</i>\nknow.\u201d\nHe squeezed Bucky\u2019s hand tighter. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go back to\ndinner and make everyone sick at how sappy we are.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSteve\nand Nat have it coming,\u201d Bucky agreed. \u201cAnd then after dinner\u2026\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAfter\ndinner,\u201d Tony said, thrilling at the thought, \u201cwe\u2019ll go back to\nour room and take advantage of that very nice bed.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><b>~fin.</b></p>",

Bucky felt a warm\nlittle spurt of fondness. Of all the friends Steve had made while\nBucky was deployed overseas, Tony was his favorite. Bucky waved, then\ndragged over a chair from another table.</p><p>\n\u201cThat\nstack must weigh almost as much as you,\u201d he said as Tony dropped\nthe books on the table with a relieved sigh.</p><p>\n\u201cJust\nabout,\u201d Tony agreed. \u201cBut they don\u2019t have ebook versions,\nso\u2026\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I only need them for a few\ndays.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201c<i>Mechanical\nEngineering and Robotics</i>,\u201d\nSteve read off the spines. \u201c<i>Fundamentals\nof Robotics Design</i>.\nTony, what the heck? You took Fundamentals three semesters ago.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\nbut I thought I should brush up.\u201d He grinned and bounced in his\nseat with barely-suppressed excitement. \u201cI got that internship with\nFujikawa!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhat!\nTony, that\u2019s fantastic!\u201d Bucky said, amidst the others\u2019\ncongratulations. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna blow \u2018em away.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\nhope so,\u201d Tony said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s just an internship, I know I\nwon\u2019t be actually working on design or anything, but\u2013\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThey\u2019ll\nbe lucky to have you,\u201d Bucky promised.</p><p>\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\nTony opened one of the books and took out a small stack of pages held\ntogether with a paperclip. \u201cOf course, now I\u2019ve got to fill in\nall this new hire paperwork. Anyone got a pen I can borrow?\u201d</p><p>\nNatasha\nhad one, because she was prepared for everything, always.</p><p>\nBucky\nand Clint went back to their game while Tony muttered over the forms\nhe was filling out and Steve and Nat bickered good-naturedly about\nwhose turn it was to decide where their next date would be.</p><p>\n\u201cOh,\ndammit,\u201d Tony sighed. \u201cThey want an emergency contact number.\nThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m putting my parents on here.\u201d</p><p>\nTony\u2019s\nwealthy father had cut Tony off after they\u2019d fought over what Tony\nshould major in, among other things. In defiance, Tony had gotten\nloans and was finishing up his degree on his own terms. Bucky was\nridiculously proud of him. \u201cPut me down, doll,\u201d Bucky suggested.</p><p>\n\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSure,\u201d\nBucky said. \u201cI\u2019m mostly on night shift anyway, so I\u2019ll be\naround when you blow something up.\u201d</p><p>\nTony\nhuffed, but wrote Bucky\u2019s name and number on the form. \u201cRobotics\ndoesn\u2019t really involve a lot of explosions,\u201d he said. \u201cMore\u2019s\nthe pity.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOkay,\nso when you accidentally create an evil robot that\u2019s bent on\ndestroying the world,\u201d Bucky amended. Tony laughed, and Bucky\nruffled his hair.</p><p><b><i>[\u2019ware the readmore!]</i></b></p>[[MORE]]<hr><p>\nTony\npushed open the door to Bucky\u2019s apartment. Bucky had given him a\nkey when it had come up that Bucky\u2019s apartment was closer to the\nFujikawa office than the fourth-floor walkup that Tony split with\nClint and Pietro. \u201cThat way you\u2019ve got a place to stash your\nbooks an\u2019 stuff so you don\u2019t gotta lug \u2018em all that way,\u201d\nBucky had said.</p><p>\nIt\nwas handy; Tony kept a couple of changes of clothes at Bucky\u2019s,\ntoo, in case he had to work late and crash on Bucky\u2019s couch. And\nBucky had given him space in the fridge, too, so Tony could eat\ndinner there before taking the subway back to his own apartment. They\noften ate together, in fact \u2013 Tony\u2019s dinner was Bucky\u2019s\nbreakfast.</p><p>\nBucky\nwas in the kitchen already when Tony came in, humming tunelessly as\nhe made a mess of the eggs in his frying pan. He looked up with a\nbright smile when Tony came in. \u201cHeya, dollface! Good day?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\nactually,\u201d Tony said. \u201cI found a little flaw in the design I was\nproofreading, and my boss said I probably saved the company a couple\nof months on the project and a shit-ton of money.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThat\u2019s\ngreat!\u201d Bucky said. He threw his arm around Tony\u2019s shoulders and\nsqueezed him in a quick hug before going back to his eggs. \u201cWe\nshould go out to celebrate.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSpeaking\nof celebration,\u201d Tony said, \u201cyour birthday is coming up. You\ngoing to let me plan a party?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhat?\nYou don\u2019t gotta go to any trouble for me,\u201d Bucky said.</p><p>\nTony\nglared at him. \u201cIt\u2019s not trouble if I <i>want</i>\nto\ndo it. C\u2019mon, it\u2019s the first birthday you\u2019ve had since you came\nback stateside. Let us take you out and have some fun!\u201d</p><p>\nBucky\nmade a face like he was going to argue, and Tony turned on the pout.\nBucky could never resist Tony\u2019s pout.</p><p>\n\u201cFine,\nokay,\u201d Bucky sighed. His mouth twitched like he was trying to\nsuppress a smile. \u201cNothin\u2019 too crazy, though, okay? It\u2019s just a\nbirthday, don\u2019t really mean nothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\npromise,\u201d Tony lied cheerfully, and whipped out his phone.\n\u201cCancelling the hunky male strippers now.\u201d</p><p>\nBucky\nlaughed. \u201cNah, you might as well keep those,\u201d he said. \u201cMakin\u2019\nStevie blush is the best present you could give me, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\n(\u201cOh\nmy <i>god</i>,\u201d\nBucky said, three weeks later. \u201cI thought you were <i>kidding</i>\nabout\nthe strippers!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBuck,\nI <i>never</i>\nkid\nabout strippers,\u201d Tony said solemnly. He\u2019d had to badger Clint\nand Bruce and Natasha into helping him pay for it, but it was totally\nworth it for the way Bucky\u2019s eyes had bugged out and the blush that\nclimbed up out of Bucky\u2019s collar.</p><p>\n\u201cBest\nbirthday ever.\u201d)</p><hr><p>\nSteve\nand Natasha were completely disgusting together pretty much all the\ntime, but for Valentine\u2019s Day, they took it to new heights. \u201cUg,\nget a <i>room</i>,\u201d\nBucky complained.</p><p>\n\u201cOr,\u201d\nClint suggested with a practiced leer, \u201cput on a show.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou\nhave a boyfriend,\u201d Bucky reminded him.</p><p>\n\u201cIt\u2019s\nokay, I\u2019ll film it for him.\u201d Clint thumbed on his phone and\nturned on the photo app.</p><p>\n\u201cGross.\nStevie, what the hell happened to the <i>evils\nof the industrial marketing complex</i>,\nhuh?\u201d</p><p>\nSteve\nmanaged to tear his gaze away from Natasha. \u201cI guess when you\u2019re\nthis much in love, you\u2019ll take any excuse to show it.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOh\n<i>gag</i>\nme,\u201d\nBucky whined.</p><p>\n\u201cKinky,\u201d\nsaid Tony in his ear. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even gotten to third base yet.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cJesus!\u201d\nBucky jumped. \u201cWhere\u2019d you come from?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cJust\ngot here.\u201d Tony dragged out a chair and dropped into it, then\ntossed a package into Bucky\u2019s lap.</p><p>\n\u201cWhat\u2019s\nthis?\u201d Bucky picked the box up and turned it over.</p><p>\n\u201cHappy\nValentine\u2019s Day,\u201d Tony said. \u201cThe bodega on Seventh already has\ntheir chocolate on\npost-holiday markdown.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNice!\u201d\nIf Bucky was going to have to watch his paired-off friends being all\nsappy and cute with each other all day while Bucky was single, it was\nnice to have consolation chocolate to go with it. \u201cBut don\u2019t\nthink this means I\u2019m putting out.\u201d</p><hr><p>\n\u201cWhat\nabout this one?\u201d</p><p>\nBucky\nleaned over Tony\u2019s shoulder to read the Craigslist ad. \u201cI dunno,\nthis guy sounds like a creeper.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThey\n<i>all</i>\nsound\nlike creepers,\u201d Tony pointed out. \u201cIt\u2019s a roommate-wanted ad.\u201d</p><p>\nBucky\nchewed on his lip. He could appreciate Tony wanting to move out of\nClint and Pietro\u2019s apartment to give the two their privacy, but he\ndidn\u2019t like the idea of Tony living with a stranger. Especially not\nwith the creeps and drug dealers that seemed to be all Tony was\nfinding on Craigslist.</p><p>\nFuck\nit. \u201cYou could always move in with me,\u201d he said. Bucky\u2019s\napartment was small, but he had it to himself.</p><p>\nTony\ngave him a wide-eyed look. \u201cI already impose on you enough.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNah.\nHalf your stuff is at my place anyway, you might as well just bring\nthe rest.\u201d</p><p>\nTony\nrubbed at the spot on his chest that meant he was considering it.\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\u201d\nBucky said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go back to night shift, but losing\nthe pay differential kinda sucked. Little help with the rent and\nbills would be nice, honestly.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019m\ngraduating next semester,\u201d Tony reminded him. \u201cOnce I get a real\njob, I can help out a lot more.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBet\nFujikawa\u2019s gonna snap you right up,\u201d Bucky said. \u201cThey keep\nre-upping your internship. They know you\u2019re a keeper.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOkay,\u201d\nTony said. \u201cYeah, we can make that work. I bet Clint and Piet will\nbe relieved to have the place to themselves, finally.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cEveryone\nwins,\u201d Bucky agreed.</p><hr><p>\nTony\nheard the door open, but didn\u2019t look up from his homework. \u201cWelcome\nhome, snugglebug.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cHey\nthere, shmoopsie,\u201d Bucky shot back. The ridiculous pet names had\nstarted as mockery of Steve and Nat, and then turned into their own\nprivate joke. \u201cAnything interesting happen today?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cRhodey\nnearly had a nervous breakdown in the computer lab when the printer\nran out of paper and the IT guy said they wouldn\u2019t be around to\nrefill it until tomorrow,\u201d Tony reported. \u201cBut I told him I\u2019d\nprint his paper here and drop it off when we meet up for drinks\nlater. That okay?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAs\nlong as it\u2019s not a hundred-pager,\u201d Bucky agreed.</p><p>\n\u201cNah,\njust twelve.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNo\nworries, then.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOh,\nand we got our invitation to Steve and Nat\u2019s wedding in the mail,\u201d\nTony said. He pointed at the table that was more of a dumping ground\nthan a useful surface. \u201cSingular invitation. One of them, for both\nof us.\u201d</p><p>\nBucky\nsnorted as he picked it up and turned it over. \u201cFancy,\u201d he\ncommented. \u201cWhat, no \u2018and Guest\u2019 for either of us?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSteve\ndid say they were trying to keep it small and intimate,\u201d Tony\npointed out. \u201cIf either of us were dating anyone, they\u2019d already\nknow about it.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThey\ndidn\u2019t have to send us an invitation at all,\u201d Bucky said. \u201cSeeing\nas we\u2019re both in the wedding party.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\nthink that\u2019s just so we can mark our dinner preference,\u201d Tony\nsaid. He squinted at his homework, erased a line of math, and\nreworked it.</p><p>\n\u201cOh,\nyeah, here\u2019s the card. Oh, you already filled it out for us. How\u2019d\nyou know I\u2019d want the chicken?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBecause\nyou only like steak if it\u2019s still bleeding, and there\u2019s no way to\nget real rare steak from a catering venue.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou\nknow me so well.\u201d Bucky messed up Tony\u2019s hair on his way past.\n\u201cGuess you\u2019ll be an okay date.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\nhope I catch the bouquet,\u201d Tony quipped. \u201cThen you\u2019ll <i>have</i>\nto\nmarry me.\u201d</p><hr><p>\nBucky\nsnared Steve\u2019s elbow and drew him aside. \u201cStevie. I hate to be a\nwet blanket at your own rehearsal dinner, but\u2026\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhat\u2019s\nwrong, Buck?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThe\nroom you got for me an\u2019 Tony\u2026 Look, I\u2019m <i>super</i>\ngrateful\nto you guys for putting us up, but there was some kind of mix-up with\nthe hotel, an\u2019 they said they can\u2019t change it without your say-so\n\u2018cause it\u2019s on your credit card.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOh.\u201d\nSteve looked relieved. \u201cIs that all? We can swing by the front desk\nand do that. What\u2019s wrong with the room?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIt\u2019s\nonly got one bed.\u201d</p><p>\nSteve\nhesitated. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s a problem?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhat\ndo you\u2013 of <i>course</i>\nit\u2019s\na problem!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSorry,\nBuck,\u201d Steve said, his eyes wide. \u201cI didn\u2019t know. You guys have\nbeen together so long, I just assumed\u2013\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWait,\u201d\nBucky said. \u201cWait wait wait. What do you mean, together? You mean\n<i>Tony\nand me</i>?\nLike, <i>together</i>,\ntogether?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWell\u2026\nyeah?\u201d Steve blinked. \u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOf\ncourse we\u2019re not!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhat\ndo you mean, \u2018of course\u2019? You an\u2019 Tony have been living in each\nother\u2019s pockets for like\u2026 two <i>years</i>\nnow.\nHe moved in with you!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThat\u2019s\nno different than when he was livin\u2019 with Clint and Pietro! It\nain\u2019t like we\u2019re suckin\u2019 face everywhere!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWe\njust figured you weren\u2019t all that demonstrative in public. Besides,\nyou flirt with each other all the time,\u201d added Steve.</p><p>\n\u201cIt\u2019s\na <i>joke</i>.\u201d</p><p>\nSteve\nput his hand on Bucky\u2019s shoulder and looked at him gravely. \u201cIs\nit?\u201d</p><p>\nBucky\u2019s\nmouth fell open, but no protest came out. Over Steve\u2019s shoulder,\nBucky could see Tony, laughing as he thumb-wrestled with Pietro over\nthe last slice of bread. Bucky caught himself smiling fondly, and\nSteve patted his shoulder. \u201cMaybe not as much of a joke as you\nthink, pal,\u201d Steve said. The jerk.</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019ll\u2026\nget back to you on that room thing,\u201d Bucky said, unable to tear his\neyes away from Tony.</p><p>\n\u201cYou\ndo that, Buck.\u201d And Steve was gone.</p><p>\nShit.\n<i>Shit</i>.\nHow had he never realized\u2026 All their friends thought they were\ndating? Had been, for\u2026 for <i>years</i>.</p><p>\nAnd\nsure, they lived together. They went everywhere together, but that\nwas just convenience. It was nice, having company when you were out\nrunning errands. It was good sense not to wander the city alone, too,\nespecially when you\u2019d been out having a good time.</p><p>\nAnd\nokay, neither of them had gone on any dates in the last couple of\nyears, either, but that was because Tony was focused on his studies\nand his internship and Bucky was\u2026</p><p>\nWas\u2026</p><p>\nOh,\n<i>fuck</i>,\nwas he in love with Tony?</p><p>\nHow\nlong had <i>that</i>\nbeen\ngoing on?</p><hr><p>\n\u201cNo\ndice with the room?\u201d Tony asked when Bucky came back to the table.\nIt was fine, Tony had figured there was a possibility that the\nhotel\u2019s double bed rooms had already been booked. They could share\na bed for two nights; it wouldn\u2019t be that much of an imposition.</p><p>\n\u201cUh.\nThere\u2019s sort of a\u2026 thing,\u201d Bucky said. He looked a little pale.</p><p>\n\u201cHey,\nyou okay?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhat?\nYeah. Yeah, I\u2019m just\u2026\u201d Bucky looked up and down the table, then\ntook a deep breath, as if steeling himself for something. \u201cCome an\u2019\ntake a little walk with me?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSure,\u201d\nTony said, pushing his chair back. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\u201d\nBucky said, leading Tony away from the noise and down a side hall. \u201cI\njust\u2026 Um.\u201d When the rehearsal party was out of sight and almost\nout of earshot, Bucky stopped and leaned against the wall. \u201cSo\u2026\nthe reason we got that room,\u201d he said, eyes on the peeling\nwallpaper, \u201cis \u2018cause apparently everyone thinks we\u2019re. Y\u2019know.\nTogether.\u201d</p><p>\nTony\nblinked. Then blinked again. \u201cYou mean <i>together</i>,\ntogether?\u201d</p><p>\nBucky\nhuffed out a little laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s \u2018xactly what I said.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOh\nmy god,\u201d Tony said. \u201cWhy the hell would they\u2013\u201d Except it made\nperfect sense, didn\u2019t it, if you were on the outside, looking in.\nBucky and Tony spent all their time together. They flirted. They gave\neach other gifts. They spent their holidays together. They gave each\nother Valentine\u2019s gifts and planned each other\u2019s birthday\nparties. They were each other\u2019s emergency contacts, for fuck\u2019s\nsake. \u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYeah,\u201d\nBucky said.</p><p>\nTony\nwas beginning to understand why Bucky looked so poleaxed. It wasn\u2019t\nlike he\u2019d never thought about it \u2013 Bucky was one damned fine\nlooking man, after all. But he\u2019d never taken it seriously. Bucky\nwas not just gorgeous but smart and brave and funny and kind, and\nTony was lucky enough just being Bucky\u2019s friend. But apparently\ntheir friends thought there was more there.

Anyone got a pen I can borrow?&rdquo;</p><p>\nNatasha\nhad one, because she was prepared for everything, always.</p><p>\nBucky\nand Clint went back to their game while Tony muttered over the forms\nhe was filling out and Steve and Nat bickered good-naturedly about\nwhose turn it was to decide where their next date would be.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Oh,\ndammit,&rdquo; Tony sighed. &ldquo;They want an emergency contact number.\nThere&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m putting my parents on here.&rdquo;</p><p>\nTony&rsquo;s\nwealthy father had cut Tony off after they&rsquo;d fought over what Tony\nshould major in, among other things. In defiance, Tony had gotten\nloans and was finishing up his degree on his own terms. Bucky was\nridiculously proud of him. &ldquo;Put me down, doll,&rdquo; Bucky suggested.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo;\nBucky said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m mostly on night shift anyway, so I&rsquo;ll be\naround when you blow something up.&rdquo;</p><p>\nTony\nhuffed, but wrote Bucky&rsquo;s name and number on the form. &ldquo;Robotics\ndoesn&rsquo;t really involve a lot of explosions,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;More&rsquo;s\nthe pity.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Okay,\nso when you accidentally create an evil robot that&rsquo;s bent on\ndestroying the world,&rdquo; Bucky amended. Tony laughed, and Bucky\nruffled his hair.</p><p><b><i>[&rsquo;ware the readmore!]</i></b></p><hr /><p>\nTony\npushed open the door to Bucky&rsquo;s apartment. Bucky had given him a\nkey when it had come up that Bucky&rsquo;s apartment was closer to the\nFujikawa office than the fourth-floor walkup that Tony split with\nClint and Pietro. &ldquo;That way you&rsquo;ve got a place to stash your\nbooks an&rsquo; stuff so you don&rsquo;t gotta lug &lsquo;em all that way,&rdquo;\nBucky had said.</p><p>\nIt\nwas handy; Tony kept a couple of changes of clothes at Bucky&rsquo;s,\ntoo, in case he had to work late and crash on Bucky&rsquo;s couch. And\nBucky had given him space in the fridge, too, so Tony could eat\ndinner there before taking the subway back to his own apartment. They\noften ate together, in fact &ndash; Tony&rsquo;s dinner was Bucky&rsquo;s\nbreakfast.</p><p>\nBucky\nwas in the kitchen already when Tony came in, humming tunelessly as\nhe made a mess of the eggs in his frying pan. He looked up with a\nbright smile when Tony came in. &ldquo;Heya, dollface! Good day?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Yeah,\nactually,&rdquo; Tony said. &ldquo;I found a little flaw in the design I was\nproofreading, and my boss said I probably saved the company a couple\nof months on the project and a shit-ton of money.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;That&rsquo;s\ngreat!&rdquo; Bucky said. He threw his arm around Tony&rsquo;s shoulders and\nsqueezed him in a quick hug before going back to his eggs. &ldquo;We\nshould go out to celebrate.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Speaking\nof celebration,&rdquo; Tony said, &ldquo;your birthday is coming up. You\ngoing to let me plan a party?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;What?\nYou don&rsquo;t gotta go to any trouble for me,&rdquo; Bucky said.</p><p>\nTony\nglared at him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not trouble if I <i>want</i>\nto\ndo it. C&rsquo;mon, it&rsquo;s the first birthday you&rsquo;ve had since you came\nback stateside. Let us take you out and have some fun!&rdquo;</p><p>\nBucky\nmade a face like he was going to argue, and Tony turned on the pout.\nBucky could never resist Tony&rsquo;s pout.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Fine,\nokay,&rdquo; Bucky sighed. His mouth twitched like he was trying to\nsuppress a smile. &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; too crazy, though, okay? It&rsquo;s just a\nbirthday, don&rsquo;t really mean nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I\npromise,&rdquo; Tony lied cheerfully, and whipped out his phone.\n&ldquo;Cancelling the hunky male strippers now.&rdquo;</p><p>\nBucky\nlaughed. &ldquo;Nah, you might as well keep those,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Makin&rsquo;\nStevie blush is the best present you could give me, anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>\n(&ldquo;Oh\nmy <i>god</i>,&rdquo;\nBucky said, three weeks later. &ldquo;I thought you were <i>kidding</i>\nabout\nthe strippers!&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Buck,\nI <i>never</i>\nkid\nabout strippers,&rdquo; Tony said solemnly. He&rsquo;d had to badger Clint\nand Bruce and Natasha into helping him pay for it, but it was totally\nworth it for the way Bucky&rsquo;s eyes had bugged out and the blush that\nclimbed up out of Bucky&rsquo;s collar.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Best\nbirthday ever.&rdquo;)</p><hr /><p>\nSteve\nand Natasha were completely disgusting together pretty much all the\ntime, but for Valentine&rsquo;s Day, they took it to new heights. &ldquo;Ug,\nget a <i>room</i>,&rdquo;\nBucky complained.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Or,&rdquo;\nClint suggested with a practiced leer, &ldquo;put on a show.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;You\nhave a boyfriend,&rdquo; Bucky reminded him.</p><p>\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nokay, I&rsquo;ll film it for him.&rdquo; Clint thumbed on his phone and\nturned on the photo app.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Gross.\nStevie, what the hell happened to the <i>evils\nof the industrial marketing complex</i>,\nhuh?&rdquo;</p><p>\nSteve\nmanaged to tear his gaze away from Natasha. &ldquo;I guess when you&rsquo;re\nthis much in love, you&rsquo;ll take any excuse to show it.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Oh\n<i>gag</i>\nme,&rdquo;\nBucky whined.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Kinky,&rdquo;\nsaid Tony in his ear. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t even gotten to third base yet.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Jesus!&rdquo;\nBucky jumped. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you come from?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Just\ngot here.&rdquo; Tony dragged out a chair and dropped into it, then\ntossed a package into Bucky&rsquo;s lap.</p><p>\n&ldquo;What&rsquo;s\nthis?&rdquo; Bucky picked the box up and turned it over.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Happy\nValentine&rsquo;s Day,&rdquo; Tony said. &ldquo;The bodega on Seventh already has\ntheir chocolate on\npost-holiday markdown.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Nice!&rdquo;\nIf Bucky was going to have to watch his paired-off friends being all\nsappy and cute with each other all day while Bucky was single, it was\nnice to have consolation chocolate to go with it. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t\nthink this means I&rsquo;m putting out.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>\n&ldquo;What\nabout this one?&rdquo;</p><p>\nBucky\nleaned over Tony&rsquo;s shoulder to read the Craigslist ad. &ldquo;I dunno,\nthis guy sounds like a creeper.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;They\n<i>all</i>\nsound\nlike creepers,&rdquo; Tony pointed out. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a roommate-wanted ad.&rdquo;</p><p>\nBucky\nchewed on his lip. He could appreciate Tony wanting to move out of\nClint and Pietro&rsquo;s apartment to give the two their privacy, but he\ndidn&rsquo;t like the idea of Tony living with a stranger. Especially not\nwith the creeps and drug dealers that seemed to be all Tony was\nfinding on Craigslist.</p><p>\nFuck\nit. &ldquo;You could always move in with me,&rdquo; he said. Bucky&rsquo;s\napartment was small, but he had it to himself.</p><p>\nTony\ngave him a wide-eyed look. &ldquo;I already impose on you enough.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Nah.\nHalf your stuff is at my place anyway, you might as well just bring\nthe rest.&rdquo;</p><p>\nTony\nrubbed at the spot on his chest that meant he was considering it.\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo;\nBucky said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go back to night shift, but losing\nthe pay differential kinda sucked. Little help with the rent and\nbills would be nice, honestly.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\ngraduating next semester,&rdquo; Tony reminded him. &ldquo;Once I get a real\njob, I can help out a lot more.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Bet\nFujikawa&rsquo;s gonna snap you right up,&rdquo; Bucky said. &ldquo;They keep\nre-upping your internship. They know you&rsquo;re a keeper.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo;\nTony said. &ldquo;Yeah, we can make that work. I bet Clint and Piet will\nbe relieved to have the place to themselves, finally.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Everyone\nwins,&rdquo; Bucky agreed.</p><hr /><p>\nTony\nheard the door open, but didn&rsquo;t look up from his homework. &ldquo;Welcome\nhome, snugglebug.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Hey\nthere, shmoopsie,&rdquo; Bucky shot back. The ridiculous pet names had\nstarted as mockery of Steve and Nat, and then turned into their own\nprivate joke. &ldquo;Anything interesting happen today?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Rhodey\nnearly had a nervous breakdown in the computer lab when the printer\nran out of paper and the IT guy said they wouldn&rsquo;t be around to\nrefill it until tomorrow,&rdquo; Tony reported. &ldquo;But I told him I&rsquo;d\nprint his paper here and drop it off when we meet up for drinks\nlater. That okay?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;As\nlong as it&rsquo;s not a hundred-pager,&rdquo; Bucky agreed.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Nah,\njust twelve.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;No\nworries, then.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Oh,\nand we got our invitation to Steve and Nat&rsquo;s wedding in the mail,&rdquo;\nTony said. He pointed at the table that was more of a dumping ground\nthan a useful surface. &ldquo;Singular invitation. One of them, for both\nof us.&rdquo;</p><p>\nBucky\nsnorted as he picked it up and turned it over. &ldquo;Fancy,&rdquo; he\ncommented. &ldquo;What, no &lsquo;and Guest&rsquo; for either of us?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Steve\ndid say they were trying to keep it small and intimate,&rdquo; Tony\npointed out. &ldquo;If either of us were dating anyone, they&rsquo;d already\nknow about it.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;They\ndidn&rsquo;t have to send us an invitation at all,&rdquo; Bucky said. &ldquo;Seeing\nas we&rsquo;re both in the wedding party.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I\nthink that&rsquo;s just so we can mark our dinner preference,&rdquo; Tony\nsaid. He squinted at his homework, erased a line of math, and\nreworked it.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Oh,\nyeah, here&rsquo;s the card. Oh, you already filled it out for us. How&rsquo;d\nyou know I&rsquo;d want the chicken?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Because\nyou only like steak if it&rsquo;s still bleeding, and there&rsquo;s no way to\nget real rare steak from a catering venue.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;You\nknow me so well.&rdquo; Bucky messed up Tony&rsquo;s hair on his way past.\n&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;ll be an okay date.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I\nhope I catch the bouquet,&rdquo; Tony quipped. &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll <i>have</i>\nto\nmarry me.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>\nBucky\nsnared Steve&rsquo;s elbow and drew him aside. &ldquo;Stevie. I hate to be a\nwet blanket at your own rehearsal dinner, but&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;What&rsquo;s\nwrong, Buck?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;The\nroom you got for me an&rsquo; Tony&hellip; Look, I&rsquo;m <i>super</i>\ngrateful\nto you guys for putting us up, but there was some kind of mix-up with\nthe hotel, an&rsquo; they said they can&rsquo;t change it without your say-so\n&lsquo;cause it&rsquo;s on your credit card.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;\nSteve looked relieved. &ldquo;Is that all? We can swing by the front desk\nand do that. What&rsquo;s wrong with the room?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nonly got one bed.&rdquo;</p><p>\nSteve\nhesitated. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; that&rsquo;s a problem?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;What\ndo you&ndash; of <i>course</i>\nit&rsquo;s\na problem!&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Sorry,\nBuck,&rdquo; Steve said, his eyes wide. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know. You guys have\nbeen together so long, I just assumed&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo;\nBucky said. &ldquo;Wait wait wait. What do you mean, together? You mean\n<i>Tony\nand me</i>?\nLike, <i>together</i>,\ntogether?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Well&hellip;\nyeah?&rdquo; Steve blinked. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Of\ncourse we&rsquo;re not!&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;What\ndo you mean, &lsquo;of course&rsquo;? You an&rsquo; Tony have been living in each\nother&rsquo;s pockets for like&hellip; two <i>years</i>\nnow.\nHe moved in with you!&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;That&rsquo;s\nno different than when he was livin&rsquo; with Clint and Pietro! It\nain&rsquo;t like we&rsquo;re suckin&rsquo; face everywhere!&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;We\njust figured you weren&rsquo;t all that demonstrative in public. Besides,\nyou flirt with each other all the time,&rdquo; added Steve.</p><p>\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\na <i>joke</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>\nSteve\nput his hand on Bucky&rsquo;s shoulder and looked at him gravely. &ldquo;Is\nit?&rdquo;</p><p>\nBucky&rsquo;s\nmouth fell open, but no protest came out. Over Steve&rsquo;s shoulder,\nBucky could see Tony, laughing as he thumb-wrestled with Pietro over\nthe last slice of bread. Bucky caught himself smiling fondly, and\nSteve patted his shoulder. &ldquo;Maybe not as much of a joke as you\nthink, pal,&rdquo; Steve said. The jerk.</p><p>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&hellip;\nget back to you on that room thing,&rdquo; Bucky said, unable to tear his\neyes away from Tony.</p><p>\n&ldquo;You\ndo that, Buck.&rdquo; And Steve was gone.</p><p>\nShit.\n<i>Shit</i>.\nHow had he never realized&hellip; All their friends thought they were\ndating? Had been, for&hellip; for <i>years</i>.</p><p>\nAnd\nsure, they lived together. They went everywhere together, but that\nwas just convenience. It was nice, having company when you were out\nrunning errands. It was good sense not to wander the city alone, too,\nespecially when you&rsquo;d been out having a good time.</p><p>\nAnd\nokay, neither of them had gone on any dates in the last couple of\nyears, either, but that was because Tony was focused on his studies\nand his internship and Bucky was&hellip;</p><p>\nWas&hellip;</p><p>\nOh,\n<i>fuck</i>,\nwas he in love with Tony?</p><p>\nHow\nlong had <i>that</i>\nbeen\ngoing on?</p><hr /><p>\n&ldquo;No\ndice with the room?&rdquo; Tony asked when Bucky came back to the table.\nIt was fine, Tony had figured there was a possibility that the\nhotel&rsquo;s double bed rooms had already been booked. They could share\na bed for two nights; it wouldn&rsquo;t be that much of an imposition.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Uh.\nThere&rsquo;s sort of a&hellip; thing,&rdquo; Bucky said. He looked a little pale.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Hey,\nyou okay?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;What?\nYeah. Yeah, I&rsquo;m just&hellip;&rdquo; Bucky looked up and down the table, then\ntook a deep breath, as if steeling himself for something. &ldquo;Come an&rsquo;\ntake a little walk with me?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo;\nTony said, pushing his chair back. &ldquo;You sure you&rsquo;re all right?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo;\nBucky said, leading Tony away from the noise and down a side hall. &ldquo;I\njust&hellip; Um.&rdquo; When the rehearsal party was out of sight and almost\nout of earshot, Bucky stopped and leaned against the wall. &ldquo;So&hellip;\nthe reason we got that room,&rdquo; he said, eyes on the peeling\nwallpaper, &ldquo;is &lsquo;cause apparently everyone thinks we&rsquo;re. Y&rsquo;know.\nTogether.&rdquo;</p><p>\nTony\nblinked. Then blinked again. &ldquo;You mean <i>together</i>,\ntogether?&rdquo;</p><p>\nBucky\nhuffed out a little laugh. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s &lsquo;xactly what I said.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Oh\nmy god,&rdquo; Tony said. &ldquo;Why the hell would they&ndash;&rdquo; Except it made\nperfect sense, didn&rsquo;t it, if you were on the outside, looking in.\nBucky and Tony spent all their time together. They flirted. They gave\neach other gifts. They spent their holidays together. They gave each\nother Valentine&rsquo;s gifts and planned each other&rsquo;s birthday\nparties. They were each other&rsquo;s emergency contacts, for fuck&rsquo;s\nsake. &ldquo;Huh.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo;\nBucky said.</p><p>\nTony\nwas beginning to understand why Bucky looked so poleaxed. It wasn&rsquo;t\nlike he&rsquo;d never thought about it &ndash; Bucky was one damned fine\nlooking man, after all. But he&rsquo;d never taken it seriously. Bucky\nwas not just gorgeous but smart and brave and funny and kind, and\nTony was lucky enough just being Bucky&rsquo;s friend. But apparently\ntheir friends thought there was more there.

You took Fundamentals three semesters ago.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n&ldquo;Yeah,\nbut I thought I should brush up.&rdquo; He grinned and bounced in his\nseat with barely-suppressed excitement. &ldquo;I got that internship with\nFujikawa!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n&ldquo;What!\nTony, that&rsquo;s fantastic!&rdquo; Bucky said, amidst the others&rsquo;\ncongratulations. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna blow &lsquo;em away.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n&ldquo;I\nhope so,&rdquo; Tony said. &ldquo;I mean, it&rsquo;s just an internship, I know I\nwon&rsquo;t be actually working on design or anything, but&ndash;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll\nbe lucky to have you,&rdquo; Bucky promised.</p>\n<p>\n&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;\nTony opened one of the books and took out a small stack of pages held\ntogether with a paperclip. &ldquo;Of course, now I&rsquo;ve got to fill in\nall this new hire paperwork. Anyone got a pen I can borrow?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\nNatasha\nhad one, because she was prepared for everything, always.</p>\n<p>\nBucky\nand Clint went back to their game while Tony muttered over the forms\nhe was filling out and Steve and Nat bickered good-naturedly about\nwhose turn it was to decide where their next date would be.</p>\n<p>\n&ldquo;Oh,\ndammit,&rdquo; Tony sighed. &ldquo;They want an emergency contact number.\nThere&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m putting my parents on here.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\nTony&rsquo;s\nwealthy father had cut Tony off after they&rsquo;d fought over what Tony\nshould major in, among other things. In defiance, Tony had gotten\nloans and was finishing up his degree on his own terms. Bucky was\nridiculously proud of him. &ldquo;Put me down, doll,&rdquo; Bucky suggested.</p>\n<p>\n&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo;\nBucky said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m mostly on night shift anyway, so I&rsquo;ll be\naround when you blow something up.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\nTony\nhuffed, but wrote Bucky&rsquo;s name and number on the form. &ldquo;Robotics\ndoesn&rsquo;t really involve a lot of explosions,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;More&rsquo;s\nthe pity.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n&ldquo;Okay,\nso when you accidentally create an evil robot that&rsquo;s bent on\ndestroying the world,&rdquo; Bucky amended. Tony laughed, and Bucky\nruffled his hair.</p>\n<p><b><i>[&rsquo;ware the readmore!]</i></b></p>\n</p>",

        "body": "<p>His head hurts.</p><p>It\u2019s become the norm at this point. He falls asleep in his workshop more\nnights than not, leaning back in his chair, or sometimes forward on the table,\nscattering whatever he was working on all over the place. Today, as he pries\nhis eyes open, he finds that beside him sit seven empty coffee mugs and a half-full\nbottle of liquor. DUM-E beeps at him worriedly as he sits blinking into space, trying\nto think through the fog in his head, and he absentmindedly pats the robot on the\narm. </p><p>\u201cJARVIS,\u201d he tries, but his voice comes out\na croak, and he remembers too late that there <i>is</i> no JARVIS anymore. He glances\naround for something to clear his throat with and his gaze falls on the liquor.\nIt\u2019s too early to drink, probably, but that doesn\u2019t stop him; he takes a sip,\nand coughs at the burn in his mouth. \u201cFRIDAY,\u201d he manages after catching his\nbreath, \u201cwhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s seven thirty-two a.m.,\u201d she tells him.\n\u201cMs Potts is upstairs. She requested that you go up and talk to her whenever\nyou wake up.\u201d</p><p>Ugh. He staggers to his feet, and his head\nspins, the ache in his temples intensifying. He pushes his seat aside and\nmanages to get to the door alright, pausing with his forehead against it just\nfor a moment. The glass door fogs up as he exhales, preparing himself mentally\nfor whatever business-related task Pepper likely has for him. S.I., money, engineering&hellip;\nhe gives himself a moment more to catch his breath and then, on unsteady feet,\nheads to the elevator. This sort of hangover is honestly old hat; he\u2019s gone out\nas Ironman with headaches like this before, so he\u2019ll totally be fine now. Besides,\nPepper is used to him. She\u2019s probably expecting him to come up looking like the\ngrounds scraped off the bottom of a pot of burnt coffee, and oh, <i>coffee</i>,\nthere\u2019s a thought, maybe he\u2019ll stop by the kitchen before going to see her. If\nshe can wait for him to wake up, she can wait a few minutes more. </p><p>The kitchen is empty. He knew it would be,\nreally, because whatever of the Avengers were not internationally-wanted\ncriminals are rarely around, despite the open invitation he\u2019s given them; but now\nisn\u2019t the time to think of that. Empty kitchen means nobody around to steal his\ncoffee, and the pot from last night still has some left in the bottom. He pours\nout a bitter cup and swallows it in one gulp, making a face \u2013 he may often\ndrink cold coffee dregs, but that doesn\u2019t make them any tastier \u2013 before shoving\nthe pot back under the machine. \u201cFRI, make me some coffee,\u201d he mutters, and the\nwhirr of the machine heating up tells her she heard him. It\u2019s been a long week;\nhe\u2019s been working on a new type of wheelchair as part of S.I.\u2019s disabilities\nprogram, and though it\u2019s going well, it\u2019s a lot of work, and he\u2019s only just\nfinished the third prototype. This time the folding-up isn\u2019t going properly, and\nthe wheels stop working at random intervals, but it runs much faster and easier\nthan the original electric wheelchair he\u2019d worked on, and he thinks he knows how\nto fix it \u2013 adjustments in a few of the pieces, and some of the coding&hellip; </p><p>He could swear he\u2019d only closed his eyes\nfor about half a second when FRIDAY says, clearing her throat, and at a volume\nfar too loud for comfort, \u201cyour coffee\u2019s getting <i>cold</i>, sir, and Ms.\nPotts is <i>impatient</i>.\u201d He can tell she\u2019s repeated herself several times,\nby the tone of voice \u2013 and what a great quality that is in an A.I.: the ability\nto get annoyed \u2013 so, eyes popping open, he grabs the coffeepot before he can\nthink and drinks straight from its spout.

And I do know that,\nTony, obviously, but you do really need to answer him, I can\u2019t put him off\nforever. Now, I came here to talk to you about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Pepper,\u201d he interrupts in a whine, and\nsticks his lower lip out dramatically as she seats herself beside him. \u201cNot\neven a hey-how-are-you?\u201d</p><p>She barely misses a beat before launching\nback into her flow of words, rolling her eyes. \u201cI know how you are, Tony, you <i>look</i>\nterrible and I imagine you feel the same. Seeing as how that\u2019s your normal\nstate of being and you do nothing to stop it, though, I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s anything\nI can say about it. Now, I\u2019m here for a few reasons. First off, I need you to\nsign these papers \u2013 some things I can\u2019t sign for you \u2013 and there\u2019s this message\nfrom the board of directors which you need to read, I assume you haven\u2019t been\nchecking your email so I figured I\u2019d bring it straight to you&hellip;\u201d</p><p>He watches her talk, mind drifting from her\nwords, and nods along at what he feels are the appropriate places, taking the\npapers and pen she hands to him and signing in the places she points at. The\ncoffee hasn\u2019t done its job yet and he still feels half-asleep, and Pepper\u2019s far\ntoo awake for this hour in the morning. The last thing she says, though, jolts\nhim to semi-awareness. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said,\u201d Pepper repeats with the\nlong-suffering patience of someone well used to dealing with him, \u201cthat Midtown\nSchool of Science and Technology is coming for a field trip next Tuesday. They\u2019ll\ndo the standard tour, plus some robotics activity or something. Anyway, you\u2019ve\nbeen asked to stop by, as with all field trips, which is why I\u2019m letting you\nknow\u2014\u201d</p><p>His face slowly spreads into a grin. That\u2019s\n<i>Peter\u2019s</i> school! <i>Peter\u2019s</i> coming here for a field trip! Oh, this is\nprecious. He\u2019s going to savour <i>this</i> one. Pepper looks at him, confused,\nbut before she can ask what he\u2019s smiling about, he says, \u201cokay, coolcoolcoolcool,\nanything else? No? I\u2019ll be going then,\u201d and gets to his feet. She grabs his arm\n\u2013 almost causing him to spill his coffee \u2013 and frowns at him. </p><p>\u201cBreakfast, Tony,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd don\u2019t\njust have a slice of toast, have some fruit or something, I know you probably\nhaven\u2019t eaten in far too long. I have to get going,\u201d because of course she\ndoes, \u201cbut <i>do</i> take care of yourself at least that much, would you? I\u2019ll\nbe back in the afternoon, anyway, so don\u2019t get too wrapped up in your work. I\u2019ll\nget FRIDAY you call you up once I arrive. Oh, and please, check your email for\nonce. I know it\u2019s tedious nonsense, but you not being responsible <i>now</i>\nmakes the job so much harder for you <i>later</i>.\u201d She smiles for the first\ntime that day, and he \u2013 tentatively \u2013 smiles back.</p><p>Then she leaves, and he makes himself some\ntoast for breakfast, along with another massive mug of coffee. His work is\nwaiting downstairs, he tells himself as he balances the toast atop his mug and\nmakes his way to the elevator; he doesn\u2019t have time to waste on a proper\nbreakfast, health or no. Besides, he doesn\u2019t have any fruit in the kitchen \u2013\nthe fridge is nearly empty now that nobody except him and sometimes Pepper uses\nit, and he hasn\u2019t bothered ordering anything from the supermarket, since he\njust gets take-out when he gets too hungry. All that\u2019s left in there is the\nremnants of some pad thai, and that\u2019s unappetizing enough even when it\u2019s <i>not</i>\nearly in the morning. Besides, his head hurts enough for hunger pangs not to\nmake much of a difference. </p><p>Down in the workshop, he throws himself\nback into the seat he left less than an hour ago. He fits on the chair as if it\u2019s\nbuilt for him (which, I mean, it <i>is</i>). <i>Just a few hours of work</i>, he\ntells himself as he pulls up the blueprints on his 3-D hologram and begins\nfiddling with some little bits by the wheel. <i>I\u2019m sure I can figure this out\nby the time Pepper gets back.</i> He shoves the slice of toast into his mouth,\nfrowning at the hologram. \u201cI just need to figure this out and it\u2019ll be uphill\nfrom there,\u201d he mutters through a mouthful of bread, trying to think of a way\nthey can fit which can make <i>that</i> piece slide into <i>there</i>, and fold\nup like <i>so</i>, and match <i>that</i>; and all in all it\u2019s rather enjoyable,\na sort of mental puzzle the likes of which he struggles against almost daily. In\nan hour or two this will probably cease to be enjoyable, and he\u2019ll start\ngetting frustrated; he\u2019ll drink more coffee than he should, and probably more\nalcohol, too; he\u2019ll take his anger out on DUM-E, or maybe on a punching bag&hellip; It\u2019s\nhis daily routine at this point. Today, though, unlike most days, he has next\nTuesday to look forward to. And normally&hellip; well, normally he has nothing at\nall.</p>",

This coffee is better, but not by much.\nStill, he gets a lot of it down in three gulps before grabbing the biggest mug\nleft in the kitchen and pouring himself a cup to go.</p><p>\u201cTell her I\u2019m coming,\u201d he calls to the\nempty room as he leaves it, \u201cor, even better, tell her to leave and let me work\non my prototypes, I think I\u2019m on to something\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll tell me nothing of the sort,\u201d a\nvoice says, and he stops abruptly in the hallway to avoid running into Pepper.\nShe\u2019s got her hair up in a ponytail and is wearing a suit, carrying a Starkpad\nunder one arm, and by the time his eyes wander to her face she\u2019s looking\nvaguely annoyed (or perhaps she was annoyed in the first place; that\u2019s probably\na safer bet). When she meets his eyes, she nods. \u201cGood morning, sunshine. The department\nof finance has been trying to get hold of you, and claim you\u2019ve been ignoring\ntheir calls \u2013 I told them that couldn\u2019t possibly be true and that I was sure\nyou were very busy, but\u2014\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve totally been ignoring their calls,\nthe guy in charge there is a bore, he won\u2019t get off my back about those\nChristmas presents I bought two weeks ago, claims I can\u2019t pull from S.I.\u2019s funds\nif I\u2019m going to spend so extravagantly, which is ridiculous, it\u2019s <i>my</i>\ncompany!\u201d She jerks her chin towards the kitchen and he turns around and\nre-enters the room, taking a seat by the counter.</p><p>\u201c<i>Our</i> company. And I do know that,\nTony, obviously, but you do really need to answer him, I can\u2019t put him off\nforever. Now, I came here to talk to you about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Pepper,\u201d he interrupts in a whine, and\nsticks his lower lip out dramatically as she seats herself beside him. \u201cNot\neven a hey-how-are-you?\u201d</p><p>She barely misses a beat before launching\nback into her flow of words, rolling her eyes. \u201cI know how you are, Tony, you <i>look</i>\nterrible and I imagine you feel the same. Seeing as how that\u2019s your normal\nstate of being and you do nothing to stop it, though, I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s anything\nI can say about it. Now, I\u2019m here for a few reasons. First off, I need you to\nsign these papers \u2013 some things I can\u2019t sign for you \u2013 and there\u2019s this message\nfrom the board of directors which you need to read, I assume you haven\u2019t been\nchecking your email so I figured I\u2019d bring it straight to you\u2026\u201d</p><p>He watches her talk, mind drifting from her\nwords, and nods along at what he feels are the appropriate places, taking the\npapers and pen she hands to him and signing in the places she points at. The\ncoffee hasn\u2019t done its job yet and he still feels half-asleep, and Pepper\u2019s far\ntoo awake for this hour in the morning. The last thing she says, though, jolts\nhim to semi-awareness. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said,\u201d Pepper repeats with the\nlong-suffering patience of someone well used to dealing with him, \u201cthat Midtown\nSchool of Science and Technology is coming for a field trip next Tuesday. They\u2019ll\ndo the standard tour, plus some robotics activity or something. Anyway, you\u2019ve\nbeen asked to stop by, as with all field trips, which is why I\u2019m letting you\nknow\u2014\u201d</p><p>His face slowly spreads into a grin. That\u2019s\n<i>Peter\u2019s</i> school! <i>Peter\u2019s</i> coming here for a field trip! Oh, this is\nprecious. He\u2019s going to savour <i>this</i> one. Pepper looks at him, confused,\nbut before she can ask what he\u2019s smiling about, he says, \u201cokay, coolcoolcoolcool,\nanything else? No? I\u2019ll be going then,\u201d and gets to his feet. She grabs his arm\n\u2013 almost causing him to spill his coffee \u2013 and frowns at him. </p><p>\u201cBreakfast, Tony,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd don\u2019t\njust have a slice of toast, have some fruit or something, I know you probably\nhaven\u2019t eaten in far too long. I have to get going,\u201d because of course she\ndoes, \u201cbut <i>do</i> take care of yourself at least that much, would you? I\u2019ll\nbe back in the afternoon, anyway, so don\u2019t get too wrapped up in your work. I\u2019ll\nget FRIDAY you call you up once I arrive. Oh, and please, check your email for\nonce. I know it\u2019s tedious nonsense, but you not being responsible <i>now</i>\nmakes the job so much harder for you <i>later</i>.\u201d She smiles for the first\ntime that day, and he \u2013 tentatively \u2013 smiles back.</p><p>Then she leaves, and he makes himself some\ntoast for breakfast, along with another massive mug of coffee. His work is\nwaiting downstairs, he tells himself as he balances the toast atop his mug and\nmakes his way to the elevator; he doesn\u2019t have time to waste on a proper\nbreakfast, health or no. Besides, he doesn\u2019t have any fruit in the kitchen \u2013\nthe fridge is nearly empty now that nobody except him and sometimes Pepper uses\nit, and he hasn\u2019t bothered ordering anything from the supermarket, since he\njust gets take-out when he gets too hungry. All that\u2019s left in there is the\nremnants of some pad thai, and that\u2019s unappetizing enough even when it\u2019s <i>not</i>\nearly in the morning. Besides, his head hurts enough for hunger pangs not to\nmake much of a difference. </p><p>Down in the workshop, he throws himself\nback into the seat he left less than an hour ago. He fits on the chair as if it\u2019s\nbuilt for him (which, I mean, it <i>is</i>). <i>Just a few hours of work</i>, he\ntells himself as he pulls up the blueprints on his 3-D hologram and begins\nfiddling with some little bits by the wheel. <i>I\u2019m sure I can figure this out\nby the time Pepper gets back.</i> He shoves the slice of toast into his mouth,\nfrowning at the hologram. \u201cI just need to figure this out and it\u2019ll be uphill\nfrom there,\u201d he mutters through a mouthful of bread, trying to think of a way\nthey can fit which can make <i>that</i> piece slide into <i>there</i>, and fold\nup like <i>so</i>, and match <i>that</i>; and all in all it\u2019s rather enjoyable,\na sort of mental puzzle the likes of which he struggles against almost daily. In\nan hour or two this will probably cease to be enjoyable, and he\u2019ll start\ngetting frustrated; he\u2019ll drink more coffee than he should, and probably more\nalcohol, too; he\u2019ll take his anger out on DUM-E, or maybe on a punching bag\u2026 It\u2019s\nhis daily routine at this point. Today, though, unlike most days, he has next\nTuesday to look forward to. And normally\u2026 well, normally he has nothing at\nall.</p>",
                "content": "<p>His head hurts.</p><p>It&rsquo;s become the norm at this point. He falls asleep in his workshop more\nnights than not, leaning back in his chair, or sometimes forward on the table,\nscattering whatever he was working on all over the place. Today, as he pries\nhis eyes open, he finds that beside him sit seven empty coffee mugs and a half-full\nbottle of liquor. DUM-E beeps at him worriedly as he sits blinking into space, trying\nto think through the fog in his head, and he absentmindedly pats the robot on the\narm. </p><p>&ldquo;JARVIS,&rdquo; he tries, but his voice comes out\na croak, and he remembers too late that there <i>is</i> no JARVIS anymore. He glances\naround for something to clear his throat with and his gaze falls on the liquor.\nIt&rsquo;s too early to drink, probably, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop him; he takes a sip,\nand coughs at the burn in his mouth. &ldquo;FRIDAY,&rdquo; he manages after catching his\nbreath, &ldquo;what time is it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s seven thirty-two a.m.,&rdquo; she tells him.\n&ldquo;Ms Potts is upstairs. She requested that you go up and talk to her whenever\nyou wake up.&rdquo;</p><p>Ugh. He staggers to his feet, and his head\nspins, the ache in his temples intensifying. He pushes his seat aside and\nmanages to get to the door alright, pausing with his forehead against it just\nfor a moment. The glass door fogs up as he exhales, preparing himself mentally\nfor whatever business-related task Pepper likely has for him. S.I., money, engineering&hellip;\nhe gives himself a moment more to catch his breath and then, on unsteady feet,\nheads to the elevator. This sort of hangover is honestly old hat; he&rsquo;s gone out\nas Ironman with headaches like this before, so he&rsquo;ll totally be fine now. Besides,\nPepper is used to him. She&rsquo;s probably expecting him to come up looking like the\ngrounds scraped off the bottom of a pot of burnt coffee, and oh, <i>coffee</i>,\nthere&rsquo;s a thought, maybe he&rsquo;ll stop by the kitchen before going to see her. If\nshe can wait for him to wake up, she can wait a few minutes more. </p><p>The kitchen is empty. He knew it would be,\nreally, because whatever of the Avengers were not internationally-wanted\ncriminals are rarely around, despite the open invitation he&rsquo;s given them; but now\nisn&rsquo;t the time to think of that. Empty kitchen means nobody around to steal his\ncoffee, and the pot from last night still has some left in the bottom. He pours\nout a bitter cup and swallows it in one gulp, making a face &ndash; he may often\ndrink cold coffee dregs, but that doesn&rsquo;t make them any tastier &ndash; before shoving\nthe pot back under the machine. &ldquo;FRI, make me some coffee,&rdquo; he mutters, and the\nwhirr of the machine heating up tells her she heard him. It&rsquo;s been a long week;\nhe&rsquo;s been working on a new type of wheelchair as part of S.I.&rsquo;s disabilities\nprogram, and though it&rsquo;s going well, it&rsquo;s a lot of work, and he&rsquo;s only just\nfinished the third prototype.
