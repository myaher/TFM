(\u201cCome Away to the Water\u201d, Glen Hansard)</i><br/></b></p><p><b><i><br/></i></b></p><p><i>Five Years Earlier</i></p><p>The room was dark, and it smelled like metal and\ncardboard and brine. It halfway comforted Fjord with its familiarity, the way\nit was the same scent that he woke up to and fell asleep to day after day. It\nwas like the well-known movement of the ship, the heartbeat-sway rhythm that\nhe\u2019d learned to counterbalance with. It only caught you off-guard if you spent\na few months on land, tripping you up and sending your legs and stomach reeling.</p><p>That was the other half \u2013 the half that filled\nFjord\u2019s lungs like he was drowning, smothering him and blanking his mind out.\nThis was a dizziness, a head-spinning panic that was mostly induced by the man\nin front of him with the grey eyes and the buzzed-short gold-brown hair and the\nsimple device clutched in his left hand.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Fjord said, hands up and fingers spread as\nif to grab but not to hit. \u201cSabien, don\u2019t. You don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of do, though.\u201d Sabien blinked \u2013 slowly, distinctly,\na motion that always drew the eyes to his face. Fjord knew well that look, that\nblink. He\u2019d seen it on Sabien\u2019s face since they were seven years old and Sabien\nwas convincing Fjord to steal the quarters from their housemother\u2019s wallet,\nlying sweetly when they were caught. \u201cThis whole shitshow\u2019s rotten to the core.\nYou ought to know that by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should blow it\nup.\u201d Sabien\u2019s hand twitched, and Fjord froze. He had no idea how sensitive the\nswitch Sabien held was. \u201cWhere\u2019s the bomb, Sabien?\u201d he asked calmly. \u201cWe can\nstill stop this. <i>You</i> \u00a0can still stop this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one ship, Fjord,\u201d Sabien said, tone dripping\nwith a mockery even Fjord could recognize. \u201cOne fucking Navy ship. One fucking\nmetal machine of death. What\u2019s one ship, more or less?\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Fjord said urgently. \u201cWhat will blowing\nup one ship do? It won\u2019t help. There\u2019s a couple hundred people on here. You\u2019ll\njust be killing innocents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one on this ship is innocent,\u201d Sabien spat,\nand he took a step back from Fjord, further from the doorway, deeper into the\nshadows of the darkened room. \u201cEvery fucker on this ship deserves what I\u2019m\ngoing to give them. Including the two of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of them didn\u2019t have a choice,\u201d Fjord said.\n\u201cAnd what about Vandren? You gonna kill him too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVandren\u2019s just as bad as the rest of them,\u201d Sabien\nsaid. \u201cYou\u2019re a fool for thinking otherwise. A fool who believes the lie that\nhe cares about us \u2013 that he cares about <i>you\n</i>.\u201d</p><p>Fjord flinched back as if stung. \u201cCome on,\u201d he\nsaid softly. \u201cSabien. Please. I know you. You don\u2019t want to do this.\u201d</p><p>For the first time, Sabien\u2019s eyes dropped from\ntheir razor focus on Fjord\u2019s. \u201cI do, though,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me, and\nyou don\u2019t get it. I do want to do this.\u201d His eyes flicked back up, and for one\nodd, vertigo-inducing moment, Fjord thought they looked completely colorless in\nthe darkness of the room. Colorless as a glass of water, but with nothing\nbehind them to distort.</p><p>\u201cRun, Fjord,\u201d Sabien whispered. \u201cYou have to run,\nhowever you can. Sometimes this is the only way.\u201d</p><p>Fjord saw the movement a second too late, and he\ncould only get to the door before he heard the ear-splitting sound of an\nexplosion.</p><p>Pain tore through his back.</p><p>He was sinking, sinking, sinking through ink-green\nwater.</p><p>*****</p><p>The next thing Fjord remembered, he was in the\nhospital with no hearing in his left ear and an uncontrollable tendency to flinch\nand freeze at loud noises.</p><p>There were no other survivors.</p><p><i>Present</i></p><p>Mollymauk Tealeaf\u2019s funeral was on a cold day in\nNovember.</p><p>It was a private affair; Molly hadn\u2019t known many\npeople \u2013 he\u2019d left his birth family behind long ago, and the people he\u2019d\ntraveled and performed with more recently. As it was, there couldn\u2019t have been\nmore than ten or fifteen people there, only one of whom Fjord recognized, and\nhe didn\u2019t really feel like saying hi to her. Jester was sitting with her\nshoulders hunched and her knit hat pulled low over her curly hair, giving off\nmore <i>don\u2019t-touch-me</i> \u00a0vibes than Fjord could ever remember getting\nfrom her.</p><p>Maybe this was the first funeral she\u2019d been to.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the first Fjord had been to, but it was\nthe first one in a while, and he\u2019d forgotten how goddamn much it hurt, losing\nsomeone.</p><p><i>You were too\ngood for this world anyways, Molly.</i></p><p>The funeral was outdoors, and there was no\nordained priest. Molly wouldn\u2019t have wanted that, despite his fondness for the\nCatholic faith, and besides, Fjord would\u2019ve been surprised if he\u2019d have been\nallowed to be buried in a parish cemetery. He probably would\u2019ve been annoyed by\nthe somber atmosphere, honestly, but Fjord didn\u2019t see there was any way around\nthat. It was winter, and the snow made everything seem sharp and painful and\nalso muffled, like silent tears. They\u2019d set up a few folding chairs; they\u2019d each\nsaid a few words that Fjord couldn\u2019t really remember.</p><p>A quiet, skinny young man with ash-pale skin and long,\ndyed pink hair in a side cut \u2013 he\u2019d introduced himself as Caduceus Clay, the\ngroundskeeper of the graveyard \u2013 had offered them tea and said a prayer over\nthe grave in a language Fjord didn\u2019t recognize. Irish, maybe. It sounded a\nlittle like Molly\u2019s slight burr.</p><p>Yasha, Molly\u2019s best friend, hadn\u2019t been able to\nstay through their makeshift ceremony. They hadn\u2019t even known if she was going\nto be able to come, only just out of the hospital as she was, but she\u2019d shown\nup with her arm in a sling and looking strange without her usual dark eye\nmakeup. She\u2019d taken one look at the grave, tombstone-less because they\u2019d barely\nbeen able to scrape together enough money to bury him, and let out a wordless\nscream that made Fjord think of stormy days at sea where all he could hear were\nthe crash of the waves and the bereft cry of sea-birds caught in winds too\npowerful for them, tossed through the skies until they were dashed against the\nsurface of the ocean. She\u2019d dropped to her knees and stayed there for a long\nminute, kneeling in the snow, before getting up and walking off before any of\nthem could stop her.</p><p>Fjord couldn\u2019t say he didn\u2019t understand the\nimpulse.</p><p>He shivered, bringing his hands up to his mouth so\nhe could breathe onto them. He was wearing thick gloves, but even they didn\u2019t\ncompletely shield his fingers from the dry, biting cold.</p><p>Another man who\u2019d stuck around, not someone Fjord\nrecognized, was wearing gloves as well \u2013 fingerless, threadbare. During the\nservice, he\u2019d been sitting next to a skinny white girl of about nineteen with a\nmedical facemask and a shabby green hoodie. She\u2019d been fidgeting with a Bic lighter\nuntil he put a hand over hers, and she\u2019d stilled for a few minutes before\nresuming. Now she was standing near Caduceus, and her friend was at Molly\u2019s\ngrave.</p><p>Fjord watched as the man crouched down and started\nwriting something with his finger in the light dusting of snow over the freshly\nturned, frozen earth. Part of him said he should leave the man to his own\ngrieving, but something \u2013 whether a morbid curiosity, or an aching wish to know\nsomeone was feeling similar pain to his \u2013 made him get up from the spindly\nfolding chair and walk over.</p><p><i>Mollymauk\nTealeaf,</i> \u00a0the man was writing. <i>Shine bright, circus man.</i></p><p>\u201cYou knew him?\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s voice was startlingly soft, rough and\nlow and coiled with a German accent. His words sounded heavy, like drowning,\nlike a thousand gallons of water filling your lungs and dragging you under.</p><p>Fjord would know.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Fjord said, and stuffed his hands back\ninto the pockets of his down jacket. \u201cRoommates, actually. We, uh\u2026\u201d He\nswallowed. \u201cYeah. I knew him. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were friends, I think,\u201d the man said. He was\nwearing a long coat, shabby as his gloves, over several sweaters layered on top\nof each other. A scarf, handmade by the look of it, was wound around his neck.\nHe had badly cut brownish-orange hair that covered his ears, and scruff that\nwent a few days beyond a five o\u2019clock shadow. He smelled like cigarettes and\nsulfur. \u201cHe was kind to me. Kinder than I deserved. He\u2026 we\u2026\u201d He trailed off,\nthen shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWell. Glad you came. He shoulda had more people\nhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the least I could do for him.\u201d The man\nglanced up, and his eyes were grey-blue, and they looked tired, and they looked\nlike the ocean during a storm. \u201cI am Caleb, by the way. Caleb Widogast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFjord.\u201d He didn\u2019t bother offering a last name.\n\u201cWho\u2019s the kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer?\u201d Caleb inclined his head towards the skinny\ngirl. \u201cNott. My sister. She was friends with Mollymauk as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know anyone else here besides her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeauregard.\u201d Caleb gestured at the other woman,\ndark face twisted in grief, besides Nott and Jester. She was standing about\ntwenty yards away, leaning against a tree. Fjord had seen her punch that tree\nhalfway through the makeshift service, then swear and grab at her bleeding\nknuckles. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJester. The one in the tights. She\u2019s pretty\nbroken up.\u201d Fjord\u2019s eyes dropped back to Molly\u2019s grave. \u201cSo\u2019m I, if it comes to\nthat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a special person,\u201d Caleb said softly,\nreaching out and resting his fingers on the snow-dusted dirt.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you cold?\u201d Fjord asked. \u201cYour hands\u2026\u201d</p><p>Caleb flexed his fingers. They were long, and\nspindly, and red. \u201cNot too bad,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI have gloves\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Caleb stood, crossing his arms over\nhis chest and burying his hands in his armpits.</p><p>Fjord was startled to realize Caleb was only a few\ninches shorter than he, and that not taking into account his hunched shoulders.\n\u201cAll right. You goin\u2019 to the, uh\u2026 the party? Wake? Whatever it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. I suppose. He would want me to.\u201d Caleb nodded\nat the grave. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t like all this silence and sadness. He liked life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sure fuckin\u2019 did,\u201d Fjord said. He closed his\neyes for a moment, hit by a sudden wave of pain as the realization struck him\nthat he\u2019d be going home to an empty apartment tonight. No Molly making a mess\nof the kitchen or keeping him up with his parties or stopping him before bed to\ndo a one-card tarot reading.</p><p>No Molly.</p><p>Fjord wiped at the hot tears that managed to\ntrickle down his face with the back of his glove. \u201cI\u2019m gonna miss that colorful\nson of a bitch,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHe was the best of us,\u201d Caleb said, and closed\nhis eyes, head bowed.</p><p>\u201cCaleb?\u201d The girl\u2019s \u2013 Nott\u2019s \u2013 voice, creaky and\nuncertain, stuttered through the snow as she slunk over. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Come here.\u201d With one arm, Caleb reached\nout and pulled Nott into him, the two of them huddled together, now. </p><p>Fjord, not wanting to intrude, backed away. On his\nway back to his seat, he stopped by where Jester was sitting. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he\nasked gently.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. Her nose was red from cold and\ncrying. \u201cI just\u2026 can\u2019t believe he\u2019s gone. Maybe he isn\u2019t. Maybe he\u2019s going to\nappear and ask why we\u2019re all so sad.\u201d</p><p>Fjord settled into the seat beside her, unsure of\nwhat to do, how to comfort her. She was scrunched into herself, arms twisted\ninto a knot across her chest, tight-clad legs wound around each other. \u201cIt\u2019s so\nstupid,\u201d she continued, voice clogged. \u201cIt\u2019s so stupid, Fjord. The world is\nmean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>It was their fault.</p><p><i>His</i> \u00a0fault.</p><p>It was a stupid decision, but he\u2019d never been able\nto say no to Jester, and she\u2019d wanted to go to the party so badly. One of the\nkids who\u2019d been coming to her storytimes for weeks now had been adopted\nunexpectedly, moving away, and Jester had needed something to cheer her up. So\nFjord had remembered the party he\u2019d been invited to by a friend of a friend,\nand said that he hadn\u2019t planned on going, but sure, why not? He could bring\nJester.</p><p>She\u2019d been so happy about it.</p><p>He\u2019d never seen her so unhappy, now, not even he\nwas driving her up from the coast that first time. Two years ago, now. She\u2019d\nbeen twenty and the entire back of his Jeep had been packed with her bags and\nshe\u2019d waved to her mom until they couldn\u2019t see her anymore, and then she\u2019d\ncried for a couple miles. This was different. She couldn\u2019t call Molly on the\nphone when she missed him like she could with her mom. She couldn\u2019t write him\nletters like she\u2019d told Fjord she was going to do for Kiri. No one could, where\nhe\u2019d gone.</p><p>And it was his fault.</p><p>Fjord was suddenly struck with a desperate need to\nleave. He stood up abruptly, the chair tilting back. \u201cI gotta \u2013 head out, Jes,\u201d\nhe mumbled. \u201cGotta head home, I \u2013\u201d</p><p>She nodded, still staring at Molly\u2019s grave, where\nCaleb and Nott were still standing, and Fjord had a feeling he should be\nworried about her, but. But. He couldn\u2019t be \u2013 not right now.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t even go to the goddamn wake, he\nthought as he walked, head down and barely paying attention, towards the street\nwhere he\u2019d parked. Couldn\u2019t even give Molly that much. He unlocked his car with\nshaking fingers, slipped into the driver\u2019s seat, and closed the door behind\nhim.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he breathed, and let his head tilt back to\nhit the headrest.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stay there forever, as much as he\nwanted to, so after a moment, he started the car, turning the heat up as high\nas it would go, and carefully navigated the snowy streets home. It wasn\u2019t far.\nTen minutes, maybe. They\u2019d chosen the graveyard closest to where he\u2019d lived.\nWhere Fjord still lived.</p><p>The eleven minutes it took Fjord to drive the\ndistance felt too short.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like he hadn\u2019t been in the place since\nMolly\u2019d died. He lived there \u2013 of course he\u2019d been in it. But now Molly was in\nthe ground, and there was a finality about that that felt different, somehow.\nAt least Molly\u2019s car wasn\u2019t parked in front; it had been totaled, Fjord had\nbeen told. (It was his name on the insurance papers. Of course it was. The\nother option had been for Molly not to have insurance at all, and Fjord had not\nbeen about to let that happen.</p><p>Not that it mattered, in the end.)</p><p>The hallway was dark when Fjord walked in, and\nFjord kept it that way. He stripped off his coat, stuffing his gloves in one of\nthe pockets, and hung it on the hook beside the door. Headed straight for his\nroom \u2013 or meant to.</p><p>Molly\u2019s bedroom was right across the hall from\nhis.</p><p>He stopped, halfway into his room. Molly\u2019s door\nwas still open a couple inches \u2013 he always forgot to pull it closed when he\nleft, and the gaudy tapestry that hung on the back of it was always getting\ncaught. Fjord could see the corner of the tapestry, now, black fabric and\nsilver thread. He could almost imagine Molly\u2019s sharp-fingered hand pulling back\nthe tapestry, Molly leaning in the doorway (Molly had been a leaner; doorways, walls,\npeople, it hadn\u2019t mattered to him) and asking if Fjord was going to spend the\nentire evening in his room, or if he wanted to hang out with him instead. Fjord\nwould smile and say he didn\u2019t have anything better to do, and he would end up\nin Molly\u2019s room, and they would listen to one of Molly\u2019s albums \u2013 Hozier,\nmaybe, or Saint Motel, or Liam Lynch, Molly\u2019s record collection seemed endless \u2013\nand Fjord would doze off against Molly\u2019s shoulder, and Molly would nudge him\nawake because he <i>didn\u2019t want you to wake\nup with a sore neck again, you\u2019re practically an old man, after all, Fjord</i>.</p><p>The doorway stayed empty, of course.</p><p>Fjord would have to go through that room\neventually.</p><p>Not today. Not when Molly still haunted it like a\nghost, like a phantom feeling in the back of Fjord\u2019s throat akin to the beginning\nof tears, like the smell of Molly that still hung heavy in the apartment (incense\nand marijuana and something like metal, or maybe blood), like a Molly-shaped space\nin the air that he couldn\u2019t step through for fear of disappearing himself.</p><p>Not when Fjord was responsible for that empty\nspace.</p><p>He shook his head and closed his bedroom door\nbehind him.</p>",

One fucking\nmetal machine of death. What\u2019s one ship, more or less?\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Fjord said urgently. \u201cWhat will blowing\nup one ship do? It won\u2019t help. There\u2019s a couple hundred people on here. You\u2019ll\njust be killing innocents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one on this ship is innocent,\u201d Sabien spat,\nand he took a step back from Fjord, further from the doorway, deeper into the\nshadows of the darkened room. \u201cEvery fucker on this ship deserves what I\u2019m\ngoing to give them. Including the two of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of them didn\u2019t have a choice,\u201d Fjord said.\n\u201cAnd what about Vandren? You gonna kill him too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVandren\u2019s just as bad as the rest of them,\u201d Sabien\nsaid. \u201cYou\u2019re a fool for thinking otherwise. A fool who believes the lie that\nhe cares about us \u2013 that he cares about <i>you\n</i>.\u201d</p><p>Fjord flinched back as if stung. \u201cCome on,\u201d he\nsaid softly. \u201cSabien. Please. I know you. You don\u2019t want to do this.\u201d</p><p>For the first time, Sabien\u2019s eyes dropped from\ntheir razor focus on Fjord\u2019s. \u201cI do, though,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me, and\nyou don\u2019t get it. I do want to do this.\u201d His eyes flicked back up, and for one\nodd, vertigo-inducing moment, Fjord thought they looked completely colorless in\nthe darkness of the room. Colorless as a glass of water, but with nothing\nbehind them to distort.</p><p>\u201cRun, Fjord,\u201d Sabien whispered. \u201cYou have to run,\nhowever you can. Sometimes this is the only way.\u201d</p><p>Fjord saw the movement a second too late, and he\ncould only get to the door before he heard the ear-splitting sound of an\nexplosion.</p><p>Pain tore through his back.</p><p>He was sinking, sinking, sinking through ink-green\nwater.</p><p>*****</p><p>The next thing Fjord remembered, he was in the\nhospital with no hearing in his left ear and an uncontrollable tendency to flinch\nand freeze at loud noises.</p><p>There were no other survivors.</p><p><i>Present</i></p><p>Mollymauk Tealeaf\u2019s funeral was on a cold day in\nNovember.</p><p>It was a private affair; Molly hadn\u2019t known many\npeople \u2013 he\u2019d left his birth family behind long ago, and the people he\u2019d\ntraveled and performed with more recently. As it was, there couldn\u2019t have been\nmore than ten or fifteen people there, only one of whom Fjord recognized, and\nhe didn\u2019t really feel like saying hi to her. Jester was sitting with her\nshoulders hunched and her knit hat pulled low over her curly hair, giving off\nmore <i>don\u2019t-touch-me</i> \u00a0vibes than Fjord could ever remember getting\nfrom her.</p><p>Maybe this was the first funeral she\u2019d been to.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the first Fjord had been to, but it was\nthe first one in a while, and he\u2019d forgotten how goddamn much it hurt, losing\nsomeone.</p><p><i>You were too\ngood for this world anyways, Molly.</i></p><p>The funeral was outdoors, and there was no\nordained priest. Molly wouldn\u2019t have wanted that, despite his fondness for the\nCatholic faith, and besides, Fjord would\u2019ve been surprised if he\u2019d have been\nallowed to be buried in a parish cemetery. He probably would\u2019ve been annoyed by\nthe somber atmosphere, honestly, but Fjord didn\u2019t see there was any way around\nthat. It was winter, and the snow made everything seem sharp and painful and\nalso muffled, like silent tears. They\u2019d set up a few folding chairs; they\u2019d each\nsaid a few words that Fjord couldn\u2019t really remember.</p><p>A quiet, skinny young man with ash-pale skin and long,\ndyed pink hair in a side cut \u2013 he\u2019d introduced himself as Caduceus Clay, the\ngroundskeeper of the graveyard \u2013 had offered them tea and said a prayer over\nthe grave in a language Fjord didn\u2019t recognize. Irish, maybe. It sounded a\nlittle like Molly\u2019s slight burr.</p><p>Yasha, Molly\u2019s best friend, hadn\u2019t been able to\nstay through their makeshift ceremony. They hadn\u2019t even known if she was going\nto be able to come, only just out of the hospital as she was, but she\u2019d shown\nup with her arm in a sling and looking strange without her usual dark eye\nmakeup. She\u2019d taken one look at the grave, tombstone-less because they\u2019d barely\nbeen able to scrape together enough money to bury him, and let out a wordless\nscream that made Fjord think of stormy days at sea where all he could hear were\nthe crash of the waves and the bereft cry of sea-birds caught in winds too\npowerful for them, tossed through the skies until they were dashed against the\nsurface of the ocean. She\u2019d dropped to her knees and stayed there for a long\nminute, kneeling in the snow, before getting up and walking off before any of\nthem could stop her.</p><p>Fjord couldn\u2019t say he didn\u2019t understand the\nimpulse.</p><p>He shivered, bringing his hands up to his mouth so\nhe could breathe onto them. He was wearing thick gloves, but even they didn\u2019t\ncompletely shield his fingers from the dry, biting cold.</p><p>Another man who\u2019d stuck around, not someone Fjord\nrecognized, was wearing gloves as well \u2013 fingerless, threadbare. During the\nservice, he\u2019d been sitting next to a skinny white girl of about nineteen with a\nmedical facemask and a shabby green hoodie. She\u2019d been fidgeting with a Bic lighter\nuntil he put a hand over hers, and she\u2019d stilled for a few minutes before\nresuming. Now she was standing near Caduceus, and her friend was at Molly\u2019s\ngrave.</p><p>Fjord watched as the man crouched down and started\nwriting something with his finger in the light dusting of snow over the freshly\nturned, frozen earth. Part of him said he should leave the man to his own\ngrieving, but something \u2013 whether a morbid curiosity, or an aching wish to know\nsomeone was feeling similar pain to his \u2013 made him get up from the spindly\nfolding chair and walk over.</p><p><i>Mollymauk\nTealeaf,</i> \u00a0the man was writing. <i>Shine bright, circus man.</i></p><p>\u201cYou knew him?\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s voice was startlingly soft, rough and\nlow and coiled with a German accent. His words sounded heavy, like drowning,\nlike a thousand gallons of water filling your lungs and dragging you under.</p><p>Fjord would know.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Fjord said, and stuffed his hands back\ninto the pockets of his down jacket. \u201cRoommates, actually. We, uh\u2026\u201d He\nswallowed. \u201cYeah. I knew him. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were friends, I think,\u201d the man said. He was\nwearing a long coat, shabby as his gloves, over several sweaters layered on top\nof each other. A scarf, handmade by the look of it, was wound around his neck.\nHe had badly cut brownish-orange hair that covered his ears, and scruff that\nwent a few days beyond a five o\u2019clock shadow. He smelled like cigarettes and\nsulfur. \u201cHe was kind to me. Kinder than I deserved. He\u2026 we\u2026\u201d He trailed off,\nthen shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWell. Glad you came. He shoulda had more people\nhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the least I could do for him.\u201d The man\nglanced up, and his eyes were grey-blue, and they looked tired, and they looked\nlike the ocean during a storm. \u201cI am Caleb, by the way. Caleb Widogast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFjord.\u201d He didn\u2019t bother offering a last name.\n\u201cWho\u2019s the kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer?\u201d Caleb inclined his head towards the skinny\ngirl. \u201cNott. My sister. She was friends with Mollymauk as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know anyone else here besides her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeauregard.\u201d Caleb gestured at the other woman,\ndark face twisted in grief, besides Nott and Jester. She was standing about\ntwenty yards away, leaning against a tree. Fjord had seen her punch that tree\nhalfway through the makeshift service, then swear and grab at her bleeding\nknuckles. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJester. The one in the tights. She\u2019s pretty\nbroken up.\u201d Fjord\u2019s eyes dropped back to Molly\u2019s grave. \u201cSo\u2019m I, if it comes to\nthat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a special person,\u201d Caleb said softly,\nreaching out and resting his fingers on the snow-dusted dirt.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you cold?\u201d Fjord asked. \u201cYour hands\u2026\u201d</p><p>Caleb flexed his fingers. They were long, and\nspindly, and red. \u201cNot too bad,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI have gloves\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Caleb stood, crossing his arms over\nhis chest and burying his hands in his armpits.</p><p>Fjord was startled to realize Caleb was only a few\ninches shorter than he, and that not taking into account his hunched shoulders.\n\u201cAll right. You goin\u2019 to the, uh\u2026 the party? Wake? Whatever it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. I suppose. He would want me to.\u201d Caleb nodded\nat the grave. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t like all this silence and sadness. He liked life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sure fuckin\u2019 did,\u201d Fjord said. He closed his\neyes for a moment, hit by a sudden wave of pain as the realization struck him\nthat he\u2019d be going home to an empty apartment tonight. No Molly making a mess\nof the kitchen or keeping him up with his parties or stopping him before bed to\ndo a one-card tarot reading.</p><p>No Molly.</p><p>Fjord wiped at the hot tears that managed to\ntrickle down his face with the back of his glove. \u201cI\u2019m gonna miss that colorful\nson of a bitch,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHe was the best of us,\u201d Caleb said, and closed\nhis eyes, head bowed.</p><p>\u201cCaleb?\u201d The girl\u2019s \u2013 Nott\u2019s \u2013 voice, creaky and\nuncertain, stuttered through the snow as she slunk over. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Come here.\u201d With one arm, Caleb reached\nout and pulled Nott into him, the two of them huddled together, now. </p><p>Fjord, not wanting to intrude, backed away. On his\nway back to his seat, he stopped by where Jester was sitting. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he\nasked gently.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. Her nose was red from cold and\ncrying. \u201cI just\u2026 can\u2019t believe he\u2019s gone. Maybe he isn\u2019t. Maybe he\u2019s going to\nappear and ask why we\u2019re all so sad.\u201d</p><p>Fjord settled into the seat beside her, unsure of\nwhat to do, how to comfort her. She was scrunched into herself, arms twisted\ninto a knot across her chest, tight-clad legs wound around each other. \u201cIt\u2019s so\nstupid,\u201d she continued, voice clogged. \u201cIt\u2019s so stupid, Fjord. The world is\nmean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>It was their fault.</p><p><i>His</i> \u00a0fault.</p><p>It was a stupid decision, but he\u2019d never been able\nto say no to Jester, and she\u2019d wanted to go to the party so badly. One of the\nkids who\u2019d been coming to her storytimes for weeks now had been adopted\nunexpectedly, moving away, and Jester had needed something to cheer her up. So\nFjord had remembered the party he\u2019d been invited to by a friend of a friend,\nand said that he hadn\u2019t planned on going, but sure, why not? He could bring\nJester.</p><p>She\u2019d been so happy about it.</p><p>He\u2019d never seen her so unhappy, now, not even he\nwas driving her up from the coast that first time. Two years ago, now. She\u2019d\nbeen twenty and the entire back of his Jeep had been packed with her bags and\nshe\u2019d waved to her mom until they couldn\u2019t see her anymore, and then she\u2019d\ncried for a couple miles. This was different. She couldn\u2019t call Molly on the\nphone when she missed him like she could with her mom. She couldn\u2019t write him\nletters like she\u2019d told Fjord she was going to do for Kiri. No one could, where\nhe\u2019d gone.</p><p>And it was his fault.</p><p>Fjord was suddenly struck with a desperate need to\nleave. He stood up abruptly, the chair tilting back. \u201cI gotta \u2013 head out, Jes,\u201d\nhe mumbled. \u201cGotta head home, I \u2013\u201d</p><p>She nodded, still staring at Molly\u2019s grave, where\nCaleb and Nott were still standing, and Fjord had a feeling he should be\nworried about her, but. But. He couldn\u2019t be \u2013 not right now.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t even go to the goddamn wake, he\nthought as he walked, head down and barely paying attention, towards the street\nwhere he\u2019d parked. Couldn\u2019t even give Molly that much. He unlocked his car with\nshaking fingers, slipped into the driver\u2019s seat, and closed the door behind\nhim.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he breathed, and let his head tilt back to\nhit the headrest.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stay there forever, as much as he\nwanted to, so after a moment, he started the car, turning the heat up as high\nas it would go, and carefully navigated the snowy streets home. It wasn\u2019t far.\nTen minutes, maybe. They\u2019d chosen the graveyard closest to where he\u2019d lived.\nWhere Fjord still lived.</p><p>The eleven minutes it took Fjord to drive the\ndistance felt too short.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like he hadn\u2019t been in the place since\nMolly\u2019d died. He lived there \u2013 of course he\u2019d been in it. But now Molly was in\nthe ground, and there was a finality about that that felt different, somehow.\nAt least Molly\u2019s car wasn\u2019t parked in front; it had been totaled, Fjord had\nbeen told. (It was his name on the insurance papers. Of course it was. The\nother option had been for Molly not to have insurance at all, and Fjord had not\nbeen about to let that happen.</p><p>Not that it mattered, in the end.)</p><p>The hallway was dark when Fjord walked in, and\nFjord kept it that way. He stripped off his coat, stuffing his gloves in one of\nthe pockets, and hung it on the hook beside the door. Headed straight for his\nroom \u2013 or meant to.</p><p>Molly\u2019s bedroom was right across the hall from\nhis.</p><p>He stopped, halfway into his room. Molly\u2019s door\nwas still open a couple inches \u2013 he always forgot to pull it closed when he\nleft, and the gaudy tapestry that hung on the back of it was always getting\ncaught. Fjord could see the corner of the tapestry, now, black fabric and\nsilver thread. He could almost imagine Molly\u2019s sharp-fingered hand pulling back\nthe tapestry, Molly leaning in the doorway (Molly had been a leaner; doorways, walls,\npeople, it hadn\u2019t mattered to him) and asking if Fjord was going to spend the\nentire evening in his room, or if he wanted to hang out with him instead. Fjord\nwould smile and say he didn\u2019t have anything better to do, and he would end up\nin Molly\u2019s room, and they would listen to one of Molly\u2019s albums \u2013 Hozier,\nmaybe, or Saint Motel, or Liam Lynch, Molly\u2019s record collection seemed endless \u2013\nand Fjord would doze off against Molly\u2019s shoulder, and Molly would nudge him\nawake because he <i>didn\u2019t want you to wake\nup with a sore neck again, you\u2019re practically an old man, after all, Fjord</i>.</p><p>The doorway stayed empty, of course.</p><p>Fjord would have to go through that room\neventually.</p><p>Not today. Not when Molly still haunted it like a\nghost, like a phantom feeling in the back of Fjord\u2019s throat akin to the beginning\nof tears, like the smell of Molly that still hung heavy in the apartment (incense\nand marijuana and something like metal, or maybe blood), like a Molly-shaped space\nin the air that he couldn\u2019t step through for fear of disappearing himself.</p><p>Not when Fjord was responsible for that empty\nspace.</p><p>He shook his head and closed his bedroom door\nbehind him.</p>",

It halfway comforted Fjord with its familiarity, the way\nit was the same scent that he woke up to and fell asleep to day after day. It\nwas like the well-known movement of the ship, the heartbeat-sway rhythm that\nhe\u2019d learned to counterbalance with. It only caught you off-guard if you spent\na few months on land, tripping you up and sending your legs and stomach reeling.</p><p>That was the other half \u2013 the half that filled\nFjord\u2019s lungs like he was drowning, smothering him and blanking his mind out.\nThis was a dizziness, a head-spinning panic that was mostly induced by the man\nin front of him with the grey eyes and the buzzed-short gold-brown hair and the\nsimple device clutched in his left hand.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Fjord said, hands up and fingers spread as\nif to grab but not to hit. \u201cSabien, don\u2019t. You don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of do, though.\u201d Sabien blinked \u2013 slowly, distinctly,\na motion that always drew the eyes to his face. Fjord knew well that look, that\nblink. He\u2019d seen it on Sabien\u2019s face since they were seven years old and Sabien\nwas convincing Fjord to steal the quarters from their housemother\u2019s wallet,\nlying sweetly when they were caught. \u201cThis whole shitshow\u2019s rotten to the core.\nYou ought to know that by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should blow it\nup.\u201d Sabien\u2019s hand twitched, and Fjord froze. He had no idea how sensitive the\nswitch Sabien held was. \u201cWhere\u2019s the bomb, Sabien?\u201d he asked calmly. \u201cWe can\nstill stop this. <i>You</i> \u00a0can still stop this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one ship, Fjord,\u201d Sabien said, tone dripping\nwith a mockery even Fjord could recognize. \u201cOne fucking Navy ship. One fucking\nmetal machine of death. What\u2019s one ship, more or less?\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Fjord said urgently. \u201cWhat will blowing\nup one ship do? It won\u2019t help. There\u2019s a couple hundred people on here. You\u2019ll\njust be killing innocents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one on this ship is innocent,\u201d Sabien spat,\nand he took a step back from Fjord, further from the doorway, deeper into the\nshadows of the darkened room. \u201cEvery fucker on this ship deserves what I\u2019m\ngoing to give them. Including the two of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of them didn\u2019t have a choice,\u201d Fjord said.\n\u201cAnd what about Vandren? You gonna kill him too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVandren\u2019s just as bad as the rest of them,\u201d Sabien\nsaid. \u201cYou\u2019re a fool for thinking otherwise. A fool who believes the lie that\nhe cares about us \u2013 that he cares about <i>you\n</i>.\u201d</p><p>Fjord flinched back as if stung. \u201cCome on,\u201d he\nsaid softly. \u201cSabien. Please. I know you. You don\u2019t want to do this.\u201d</p><p>For the first time, Sabien\u2019s eyes dropped from\ntheir razor focus on Fjord\u2019s. \u201cI do, though,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me, and\nyou don\u2019t get it. I do want to do this.\u201d His eyes flicked back up, and for one\nodd, vertigo-inducing moment, Fjord thought they looked completely colorless in\nthe darkness of the room. Colorless as a glass of water, but with nothing\nbehind them to distort.</p><p>\u201cRun, Fjord,\u201d Sabien whispered. \u201cYou have to run,\nhowever you can. Sometimes this is the only way.\u201d</p><p>Fjord saw the movement a second too late, and he\ncould only get to the door before he heard the ear-splitting sound of an\nexplosion.</p><p>Pain tore through his back.</p><p>He was sinking, sinking, sinking through ink-green\nwater.</p><p>*****</p><p>The next thing Fjord remembered, he was in the\nhospital with no hearing in his left ear and an uncontrollable tendency to flinch\nand freeze at loud noises.</p><p>There were no other survivors.</p><p><i>Present</i></p><p>Mollymauk Tealeaf\u2019s funeral was on a cold day in\nNovember.</p><p>It was a private affair; Molly hadn\u2019t known many\npeople \u2013 he\u2019d left his birth family behind long ago, and the people he\u2019d\ntraveled and performed with more recently. As it was, there couldn\u2019t have been\nmore than ten or fifteen people there, only one of whom Fjord recognized, and\nhe didn\u2019t really feel like saying hi to her. Jester was sitting with her\nshoulders hunched and her knit hat pulled low over her curly hair, giving off\nmore <i>don\u2019t-touch-me</i> \u00a0vibes than Fjord could ever remember getting\nfrom her.</p><p>Maybe this was the first funeral she\u2019d been to.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the first Fjord had been to, but it was\nthe first one in a while, and he\u2019d forgotten how goddamn much it hurt, losing\nsomeone.</p><p><i>You were too\ngood for this world anyways, Molly.</i></p><p>The funeral was outdoors, and there was no\nordained priest. Molly wouldn\u2019t have wanted that, despite his fondness for the\nCatholic faith, and besides, Fjord would\u2019ve been surprised if he\u2019d have been\nallowed to be buried in a parish cemetery. He probably would\u2019ve been annoyed by\nthe somber atmosphere, honestly, but Fjord didn\u2019t see there was any way around\nthat. It was winter, and the snow made everything seem sharp and painful and\nalso muffled, like silent tears. They\u2019d set up a few folding chairs; they\u2019d each\nsaid a few words that Fjord couldn\u2019t really remember.</p><p>A quiet, skinny young man with ash-pale skin and long,\ndyed pink hair in a side cut \u2013 he\u2019d introduced himself as Caduceus Clay, the\ngroundskeeper of the graveyard \u2013 had offered them tea and said a prayer over\nthe grave in a language Fjord didn\u2019t recognize. Irish, maybe. It sounded a\nlittle like Molly\u2019s slight burr.</p><p>Yasha, Molly\u2019s best friend, hadn\u2019t been able to\nstay through their makeshift ceremony. They hadn\u2019t even known if she was going\nto be able to come, only just out of the hospital as she was, but she\u2019d shown\nup with her arm in a sling and looking strange without her usual dark eye\nmakeup. She\u2019d taken one look at the grave, tombstone-less because they\u2019d barely\nbeen able to scrape together enough money to bury him, and let out a wordless\nscream that made Fjord think of stormy days at sea where all he could hear were\nthe crash of the waves and the bereft cry of sea-birds caught in winds too\npowerful for them, tossed through the skies until they were dashed against the\nsurface of the ocean. She\u2019d dropped to her knees and stayed there for a long\nminute, kneeling in the snow, before getting up and walking off before any of\nthem could stop her.</p><p>Fjord couldn\u2019t say he didn\u2019t understand the\nimpulse.</p><p>He shivered, bringing his hands up to his mouth so\nhe could breathe onto them. He was wearing thick gloves, but even they didn\u2019t\ncompletely shield his fingers from the dry, biting cold.</p><p>Another man who\u2019d stuck around, not someone Fjord\nrecognized, was wearing gloves as well \u2013 fingerless, threadbare. During the\nservice, he\u2019d been sitting next to a skinny white girl of about nineteen with a\nmedical facemask and a shabby green hoodie. She\u2019d been fidgeting with a Bic lighter\nuntil he put a hand over hers, and she\u2019d stilled for a few minutes before\nresuming. Now she was standing near Caduceus, and her friend was at Molly\u2019s\ngrave.</p><p>Fjord watched as the man crouched down and started\nwriting something with his finger in the light dusting of snow over the freshly\nturned, frozen earth. Part of him said he should leave the man to his own\ngrieving, but something \u2013 whether a morbid curiosity, or an aching wish to know\nsomeone was feeling similar pain to his \u2013 made him get up from the spindly\nfolding chair and walk over.</p><p><i>Mollymauk\nTealeaf,</i> \u00a0the man was writing. <i>Shine bright, circus man.</i></p><p>\u201cYou knew him?\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s voice was startlingly soft, rough and\nlow and coiled with a German accent. His words sounded heavy, like drowning,\nlike a thousand gallons of water filling your lungs and dragging you under.</p><p>Fjord would know.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Fjord said, and stuffed his hands back\ninto the pockets of his down jacket. \u201cRoommates, actually. We, uh\u2026\u201d He\nswallowed. \u201cYeah. I knew him. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were friends, I think,\u201d the man said. He was\nwearing a long coat, shabby as his gloves, over several sweaters layered on top\nof each other. A scarf, handmade by the look of it, was wound around his neck.\nHe had badly cut brownish-orange hair that covered his ears, and scruff that\nwent a few days beyond a five o\u2019clock shadow. He smelled like cigarettes and\nsulfur. \u201cHe was kind to me. Kinder than I deserved. He\u2026 we\u2026\u201d He trailed off,\nthen shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWell. Glad you came. He shoulda had more people\nhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the least I could do for him.\u201d The man\nglanced up, and his eyes were grey-blue, and they looked tired, and they looked\nlike the ocean during a storm. \u201cI am Caleb, by the way. Caleb Widogast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFjord.\u201d He didn\u2019t bother offering a last name.\n\u201cWho\u2019s the kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer?\u201d Caleb inclined his head towards the skinny\ngirl. \u201cNott. My sister. She was friends with Mollymauk as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know anyone else here besides her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeauregard.\u201d Caleb gestured at the other woman,\ndark face twisted in grief, besides Nott and Jester. She was standing about\ntwenty yards away, leaning against a tree. Fjord had seen her punch that tree\nhalfway through the makeshift service, then swear and grab at her bleeding\nknuckles. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJester. The one in the tights. She\u2019s pretty\nbroken up.\u201d Fjord\u2019s eyes dropped back to Molly\u2019s grave. \u201cSo\u2019m I, if it comes to\nthat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a special person,\u201d Caleb said softly,\nreaching out and resting his fingers on the snow-dusted dirt.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you cold?\u201d Fjord asked. \u201cYour hands\u2026\u201d</p><p>Caleb flexed his fingers. They were long, and\nspindly, and red. \u201cNot too bad,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI have gloves\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Caleb stood, crossing his arms over\nhis chest and burying his hands in his armpits.</p><p>Fjord was startled to realize Caleb was only a few\ninches shorter than he, and that not taking into account his hunched shoulders.\n\u201cAll right. You goin\u2019 to the, uh\u2026 the party? Wake? Whatever it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. I suppose.

It halfway comforted Fjord with its familiarity, the way\nit was the same scent that he woke up to and fell asleep to day after day. It\nwas like the well-known movement of the ship, the heartbeat-sway rhythm that\nhe&rsquo;d learned to counterbalance with. It only caught you off-guard if you spent\na few months on land, tripping you up and sending your legs and stomach reeling.</p><p>That was the other half &ndash; the half that filled\nFjord&rsquo;s lungs like he was drowning, smothering him and blanking his mind out.\nThis was a dizziness, a head-spinning panic that was mostly induced by the man\nin front of him with the grey eyes and the buzzed-short gold-brown hair and the\nsimple device clutched in his left hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Fjord said, hands up and fingers spread as\nif to grab but not to hit. &ldquo;Sabien, don&rsquo;t. You don&rsquo;t have to do this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kind of do, though.&rdquo; Sabien blinked &ndash; slowly, distinctly,\na motion that always drew the eyes to his face. Fjord knew well that look, that\nblink. He&rsquo;d seen it on Sabien&rsquo;s face since they were seven years old and Sabien\nwas convincing Fjord to steal the quarters from their housemother&rsquo;s wallet,\nlying sweetly when they were caught. &ldquo;This whole shitshow&rsquo;s rotten to the core.\nYou ought to know that by now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you should blow it\nup.&rdquo; Sabien&rsquo;s hand twitched, and Fjord froze. He had no idea how sensitive the\nswitch Sabien held was. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the bomb, Sabien?&rdquo; he asked calmly. &ldquo;We can\nstill stop this. <i>You</i> &nbsp;can still stop this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one ship, Fjord,&rdquo; Sabien said, tone dripping\nwith a mockery even Fjord could recognize. &ldquo;One fucking Navy ship. One fucking\nmetal machine of death. What&rsquo;s one ship, more or less?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; Fjord said urgently. &ldquo;What will blowing\nup one ship do? It won&rsquo;t help. There&rsquo;s a couple hundred people on here. You&rsquo;ll\njust be killing innocents.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No one on this ship is innocent,&rdquo; Sabien spat,\nand he took a step back from Fjord, further from the doorway, deeper into the\nshadows of the darkened room. &ldquo;Every fucker on this ship deserves what I&rsquo;m\ngoing to give them. Including the two of us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Some of them didn&rsquo;t have a choice,&rdquo; Fjord said.\n&ldquo;And what about Vandren? You gonna kill him too?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Vandren&rsquo;s just as bad as the rest of them,&rdquo; Sabien\nsaid. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fool for thinking otherwise. A fool who believes the lie that\nhe cares about us &ndash; that he cares about <i>you\n</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Fjord flinched back as if stung. &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he\nsaid softly. &ldquo;Sabien. Please. I know you. You don&rsquo;t want to do this.&rdquo;</p><p>For the first time, Sabien&rsquo;s eyes dropped from\ntheir razor focus on Fjord&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I do, though,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know me, and\nyou don&rsquo;t get it. I do want to do this.&rdquo; His eyes flicked back up, and for one\nodd, vertigo-inducing moment, Fjord thought they looked completely colorless in\nthe darkness of the room. Colorless as a glass of water, but with nothing\nbehind them to distort.</p><p>&ldquo;Run, Fjord,&rdquo; Sabien whispered. &ldquo;You have to run,\nhowever you can. Sometimes this is the only way.&rdquo;</p><p>Fjord saw the movement a second too late, and he\ncould only get to the door before he heard the ear-splitting sound of an\nexplosion.</p><p>Pain tore through his back.</p><p>He was sinking, sinking, sinking through ink-green\nwater.</p><p>*****</p><p>The next thing Fjord remembered, he was in the\nhospital with no hearing in his left ear and an uncontrollable tendency to flinch\nand freeze at loud noises.</p><p>There were no other survivors.</p><p><i>Present</i></p><p>Mollymauk Tealeaf&rsquo;s funeral was on a cold day in\nNovember.</p><p>It was a private affair; Molly hadn&rsquo;t known many\npeople &ndash; he&rsquo;d left his birth family behind long ago, and the people he&rsquo;d\ntraveled and performed with more recently. As it was, there couldn&rsquo;t have been\nmore than ten or fifteen people there, only one of whom Fjord recognized, and\nhe didn&rsquo;t really feel like saying hi to her. Jester was sitting with her\nshoulders hunched and her knit hat pulled low over her curly hair, giving off\nmore <i>don&rsquo;t-touch-me</i> &nbsp;vibes than Fjord could ever remember getting\nfrom her.</p><p>Maybe this was the first funeral she&rsquo;d been to.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t the first Fjord had been to, but it was\nthe first one in a while, and he&rsquo;d forgotten how goddamn much it hurt, losing\nsomeone.</p><p><i>You were too\ngood for this world anyways, Molly.</i></p><p>The funeral was outdoors, and there was no\nordained priest. Molly wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted that, despite his fondness for the\nCatholic faith, and besides, Fjord would&rsquo;ve been surprised if he&rsquo;d have been\nallowed to be buried in a parish cemetery. He probably would&rsquo;ve been annoyed by\nthe somber atmosphere, honestly, but Fjord didn&rsquo;t see there was any way around\nthat. It was winter, and the snow made everything seem sharp and painful and\nalso muffled, like silent tears. They&rsquo;d set up a few folding chairs; they&rsquo;d each\nsaid a few words that Fjord couldn&rsquo;t really remember.</p><p>A quiet, skinny young man with ash-pale skin and long,\ndyed pink hair in a side cut &ndash; he&rsquo;d introduced himself as Caduceus Clay, the\ngroundskeeper of the graveyard &ndash; had offered them tea and said a prayer over\nthe grave in a language Fjord didn&rsquo;t recognize. Irish, maybe. It sounded a\nlittle like Molly&rsquo;s slight burr.</p><p>Yasha, Molly&rsquo;s best friend, hadn&rsquo;t been able to\nstay through their makeshift ceremony. They hadn&rsquo;t even known if she was going\nto be able to come, only just out of the hospital as she was, but she&rsquo;d shown\nup with her arm in a sling and looking strange without her usual dark eye\nmakeup. She&rsquo;d taken one look at the grave, tombstone-less because they&rsquo;d barely\nbeen able to scrape together enough money to bury him, and let out a wordless\nscream that made Fjord think of stormy days at sea where all he could hear were\nthe crash of the waves and the bereft cry of sea-birds caught in winds too\npowerful for them, tossed through the skies until they were dashed against the\nsurface of the ocean. She&rsquo;d dropped to her knees and stayed there for a long\nminute, kneeling in the snow, before getting up and walking off before any of\nthem could stop her.</p><p>Fjord couldn&rsquo;t say he didn&rsquo;t understand the\nimpulse.</p><p>He shivered, bringing his hands up to his mouth so\nhe could breathe onto them. He was wearing thick gloves, but even they didn&rsquo;t\ncompletely shield his fingers from the dry, biting cold.</p><p>Another man who&rsquo;d stuck around, not someone Fjord\nrecognized, was wearing gloves as well &ndash; fingerless, threadbare. During the\nservice, he&rsquo;d been sitting next to a skinny white girl of about nineteen with a\nmedical facemask and a shabby green hoodie. She&rsquo;d been fidgeting with a Bic lighter\nuntil he put a hand over hers, and she&rsquo;d stilled for a few minutes before\nresuming. Now she was standing near Caduceus, and her friend was at Molly&rsquo;s\ngrave.</p><p>Fjord watched as the man crouched down and started\nwriting something with his finger in the light dusting of snow over the freshly\nturned, frozen earth. Part of him said he should leave the man to his own\ngrieving, but something &ndash; whether a morbid curiosity, or an aching wish to know\nsomeone was feeling similar pain to his &ndash; made him get up from the spindly\nfolding chair and walk over.</p><p><i>Mollymauk\nTealeaf,</i> &nbsp;the man was writing. <i>Shine bright, circus man.</i></p><p>&ldquo;You knew him?&rdquo;</p><p>The man&rsquo;s voice was startlingly soft, rough and\nlow and coiled with a German accent. His words sounded heavy, like drowning,\nlike a thousand gallons of water filling your lungs and dragging you under.</p><p>Fjord would know.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Fjord said, and stuffed his hands back\ninto the pockets of his down jacket. &ldquo;Roommates, actually. We, uh&hellip;&rdquo; He\nswallowed. &ldquo;Yeah. I knew him. You?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We were friends, I think,&rdquo; the man said. He was\nwearing a long coat, shabby as his gloves, over several sweaters layered on top\nof each other. A scarf, handmade by the look of it, was wound around his neck.\nHe had badly cut brownish-orange hair that covered his ears, and scruff that\nwent a few days beyond a five o&rsquo;clock shadow. He smelled like cigarettes and\nsulfur. &ldquo;He was kind to me. Kinder than I deserved. He&hellip; we&hellip;&rdquo; He trailed off,\nthen shrugged.</p><p>&ldquo;Well. Glad you came. He shoulda had more people\nhere.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was the least I could do for him.&rdquo; The man\nglanced up, and his eyes were grey-blue, and they looked tired, and they looked\nlike the ocean during a storm. &ldquo;I am Caleb, by the way. Caleb Widogast.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fjord.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t bother offering a last name.\n&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the kid?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Her?&rdquo; Caleb inclined his head towards the skinny\ngirl. &ldquo;Nott. My sister. She was friends with Mollymauk as well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know anyone else here besides her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Beauregard.&rdquo; Caleb gestured at the other woman,\ndark face twisted in grief, besides Nott and Jester. She was standing about\ntwenty yards away, leaning against a tree. Fjord had seen her punch that tree\nhalfway through the makeshift service, then swear and grab at her bleeding\nknuckles. &ldquo;You?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jester. The one in the tights. She&rsquo;s pretty\nbroken up.&rdquo; Fjord&rsquo;s eyes dropped back to Molly&rsquo;s grave. &ldquo;So&rsquo;m I, if it comes to\nthat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He was a special person,&rdquo; Caleb said softly,\nreaching out and resting his fingers on the snow-dusted dirt.</p><p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you cold?&rdquo; Fjord asked. &ldquo;Your hands&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Caleb flexed his fingers. They were long, and\nspindly, and red. &ldquo;Not too bad,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;I have gloves&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo; Caleb stood, crossing his arms over\nhis chest and burying his hands in his armpits.</p><p>Fjord was startled to realize Caleb was only a few\ninches shorter than he, and that not taking into account his hunched shoulders.\n&ldquo;All right. You goin&rsquo; to the, uh&hellip; the party? Wake? Whatever it is?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah. I suppose. He would want me to.&rdquo; Caleb nodded\nat the grave. &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t like all this silence and sadness. He liked life.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He sure fuckin&rsquo; did,&rdquo; Fjord said. He closed his\neyes for a moment, hit by a sudden wave of pain as the realization struck him\nthat he&rsquo;d be going home to an empty apartment tonight. No Molly making a mess\nof the kitchen or keeping him up with his parties or stopping him before bed to\ndo a one-card tarot reading.</p><p>No Molly.</p><p>Fjord wiped at the hot tears that managed to\ntrickle down his face with the back of his glove. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna miss that colorful\nson of a bitch,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;He was the best of us,&rdquo; Caleb said, and closed\nhis eyes, head bowed.</p><p>&ldquo;Caleb?&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s &ndash; Nott&rsquo;s &ndash; voice, creaky and\nuncertain, stuttered through the snow as she slunk over. &ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe.

She was scrunched into herself, arms twisted\ninto a knot across her chest, tight-clad legs wound around each other. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so\nstupid,&rdquo; she continued, voice clogged. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so stupid, Fjord. The world is\nmean.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; He sighed. &ldquo;I know.

(&ldquo;Come Away to the Water&rdquo;, Glen Hansard)</i><br /></b></p>\n<p><b><i><br /></i></b></p>\n<p><i>Five Years Earlier</i></p>\n<p>The room was dark, and it smelled like metal and\ncardboard and brine. It halfway comforted Fjord with its familiarity, the way\nit was the same scent that he woke up to and fell asleep to day after day. It\nwas like the well-known movement of the ship, the heartbeat-sway rhythm that\nhe&rsquo;d learned to counterbalance with. It only caught you off-guard if you spent\na few months on land, tripping you up and sending your legs and stomach reeling.</p>\n<p>That was the other half &ndash; the half that filled\nFjord&rsquo;s lungs like he was drowning, smothering him and blanking his mind out.\nThis was a dizziness, a head-spinning panic that was mostly induced by the man\nin front of him with the grey eyes and the buzzed-short gold-brown hair and the\nsimple device clutched in his left hand.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Fjord said, hands up and fingers spread as\nif to grab but not to hit. &ldquo;Sabien, don&rsquo;t. You don&rsquo;t have to do this.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Kind of do, though.&rdquo; Sabien blinked &ndash; slowly, distinctly,\na motion that always drew the eyes to his face. Fjord knew well that look, that\nblink. He&rsquo;d seen it on Sabien&rsquo;s face since they were seven years old and Sabien\nwas convincing Fjord to steal the quarters from their housemother&rsquo;s wallet,\nlying sweetly when they were caught. &ldquo;This whole shitshow&rsquo;s rotten to the core.\nYou ought to know that by now.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you should blow it\nup.&rdquo; Sabien&rsquo;s hand twitched, and Fjord froze. He had no idea how sensitive the\nswitch Sabien held was. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the bomb, Sabien?&rdquo; he asked calmly. &ldquo;We can\nstill stop this. <i>You</i> &nbsp;can still stop this.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one ship, Fjord,&rdquo; Sabien said, tone dripping\nwith a mockery even Fjord could recognize. &ldquo;One fucking Navy ship. One fucking\nmetal machine of death. What&rsquo;s one ship, more or less?&rdquo;</p>\n</p>",
