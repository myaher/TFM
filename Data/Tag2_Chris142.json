As if connected, fifty pairs of eyes turned to the production assistant who&rsquo;d been given the important duty of watching Chris&rsquo;s phone while he was on set during the last month of Nikki&rsquo;s pregnancy.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your brother-in-law,&rdquo; the assistant told Chris, after looking at the phone.</p><p>Brow furrowed, Chris made his way over to the assistant and took the phone, unsure as to why Mikey was calling him. Answering the phone, he told his brother-in-law to give him a minute as he made his way out of the soundstage and out into the hot Atlanta sun.</p><!-- more --><p>Of all the people that Chris was expecting to hear from, Mikey wasn&rsquo;t one of them. Typically, when he was on a job, his family members texted him to call them back when he had time, so the fact that Mikey had called made Chris a little nervous, especially since his mom and Nikki&rsquo;s mom were in Atlanta with them.</p><p>&ldquo;Mikey?&rdquo; Chris said into the phone. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Chris,&rdquo; his brother-in-law replied, his tone weary. &ldquo;Sorry for calling you while you were on set, but I needed to call you before you heard from anyone else.&rdquo;</p><p>His words and the pause he took after put Chris on high alert.</p><p>&ldquo;Ms. Rachel passed away last night,&rdquo; his brother-in-law finally said.</p><p>Chris&rsquo;s stomach dropped and he felt tears pool in the corner of his eyes as he thought of his and Nikki&rsquo;s former neighbor. He took a shaky breath and asked, &ldquo;does Nikki know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Mikey stated. &ldquo;I called mom hoping that you were home. When you weren&rsquo;t, I told her to turn Nikki&rsquo;s phone off. Of course, mom demanded to know why, so she and your mom both know. I told them to let you tell Nikki and the boys.&rdquo;</p><p>Chris sniffed as a tear rolled down his cheek. Ms. Rachel had been the only grandmother-like figure in Nikki&rsquo;s life and the news of her passing was going to break his wife&rsquo;s heart.</p><p>&ldquo;You still there?&rdquo; his brother-in-law asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Chris confirmed after clearing his throat. &ldquo;Thanks for calling me, Mikey.&rdquo; He pulled his phone away from his ear to look at the time and saw that he only had about two hours left until the end of the work week. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call Ms. Rachel&rsquo;s son once we wrap for the day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let me know if there is anything I can do to help,&rdquo; Mikey told him. &ldquo;You or Ms. Rachel&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; Chris assured him.</p><p>After saying goodbye, Chris dried his face with his hand and then took a minute to compose himself. Once he was ready, he went back into the soundstage and found them rehearsing the scene again. He gave the assistant his phone and then made his way over to the makeup artist on set, knowing he was going to need a touch up.</p><p>While they fussed over his makeup, Chris&rsquo;s longtime friend Scarlett Johansson made her way over.</p><p>&ldquo;Everything ok?&rdquo; she asked him.</p><p>Chris nodded as the makeup team finished touching up his makeup. He knew that Scarlett could tell he wasn&rsquo;t being honest, but he had to get through the last two hours of their filming schedule and then they would all be off for the weekend.</p><p>Two hours later, Scarlett took the same golf cart as Chris to get back to their trailers and he told her about Ms. Rachel&rsquo;s passing. Even though his friend had only met the woman a couple times, she still expressed emotion over the loss; after all, she more than anyone knew how close Chris&rsquo;s family had been to Ms. Rachel as she had visited them in Sudbury a handful of times.</p><p>Before parting ways for the evening, Scarlet told him that she&rsquo;d take care of their dinner for the next night. He tried to convince her it was ok, but she waved him off, saying that she&rsquo;d handle it.</p><p>Going into his trailer, Chris changed out of his costume and into the clothes he&rsquo;d worn that day to the studio. Knowing that his drive home wouldn&rsquo;t take too long, he sat down on the couch and called Ms. Rachel&rsquo;s son, Craig, who he&rsquo;d met in person many times when the son had visited from California with his family.</p><p>During the conversation, Chris learned that Ms. Rachel had passed away peacefully in her sleep and had been discovered by their neighbor Jan, who&rsquo;d noticed that Ms. Rachel&rsquo;s cats were acting strangely in the window as if trying to get someone&rsquo;s attention. It had been Jan who&rsquo;d called the authorities and then had reached out to Craig to tell him.</p><p>Craig expressed his thanks Chris and their other neighbors who&rsquo;d watched out for his mom during the last few years. He&rsquo;d been in a difficult situation with his wife&rsquo;s parents in California needing care and his mom refusing to leave the east coast. Knowing his mom had had neighbors that treated her like family had made the whole situation easier for them. Before hanging up, Craig promised to keep Chris informed about funeral arrangements and if there was anything he and Nikki could do to help.</p><p>Teary-eyed from the conversation, Chris used a tissue to dry his eyes and then headed out to his car. He used the short drive from the studio to their rental house to mentally prepare himself for the bomb he was going to have to drop in the lap of his wife who was 36-weeks pregnant.</p><p>Pulling into the crowded driveway, Chris spotted Nikki sitting on the porch swing and knew she was waiting for him. He was proved correct when she met him at the top of the steps to the porch with her hands planted on her hips, a minute later.</p><p>&ldquo;Would you please explain to me why our mothers won&rsquo;t give me my phone and or look me in the eye?!&rdquo; she demanded in the short tone she usually reserved for the dogs when they were misbehaving.</p><p>Chris took a deep breath and reached for her hand, but she dodged his first attempt. &ldquo;Please, Nik,&rdquo; he said, his voice cracking. Meeting her eyes, he blinked back the tears that were pooling again.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked, her voice full of emotion. &ldquo;Chris, what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t resist as Chris took her hand and led her over to the porch swing. &ldquo;Chris?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I got a phone call today,&rdquo; he started, his voice wavering as all of the emotions he&rsquo;d kept at bay began to bubble up. &ldquo;Nik, baby, Ms. Rachel -&rdquo;</p><p>The gut wrenching sob that met his ears told him that his wife had figured out what happened to Ms. Rachel without him having to say that she&rsquo;d passed. Chris wrapped his arms around her and let his own tears flow freely over the beloved grandmother-figure they&rsquo;d both lost.</p><p>When there were no more tears to cry, Nikki sniffed and used her thumbs to dry her eyes then chuckled a little when Chris offered her a corner of his shirt to use instead. She shook her head, but leaned back into his embrace, basking in the comfort he was able to give her.</p><p>&ldquo;How do you feel about changing the baby&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; she asked, after a few minutes of silence. &ldquo;I know we&rsquo;d agreed on Charlotte, but now\u2026&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now you want to name her after Ms. Rachel?&rdquo; Chris finished and Nikki nodded. &ldquo;I love that idea. Same middle name?

Answering the phone, he told his brother-in-law to give him a minute as he made his way out of the soundstage and out into the hot Atlanta sun.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Of all the people that Chris was expecting to hear from, Mikey wasn\u2019t one of them. Typically, when he was on a job, his family members texted him to call them back when he had time, so the fact that Mikey had called made Chris a little nervous, especially since his mom and Nikki\u2019s mom were in Atlanta with them.</p><p>\u201cMikey?\u201d Chris said into the phone. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Chris,\u201d his brother-in-law replied, his tone weary. \u201cSorry for calling you while you were on set, but I needed to call you before you heard from anyone else.\u201d</p><p>His words and the pause he took after put Chris on high alert.</p><p>\u201cMs. Rachel passed away last night,\u201d his brother-in-law finally said.</p><p>Chris\u2019s stomach dropped and he felt tears pool in the corner of his eyes as he thought of his and Nikki\u2019s former neighbor. He took a shaky breath and asked, \u201cdoes Nikki know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mikey stated. \u201cI called mom hoping that you were home. When you weren\u2019t, I told her to turn Nikki\u2019s phone off. Of course, mom demanded to know why, so she and your mom both know. I told them to let you tell Nikki and the boys.\u201d</p><p>Chris sniffed as a tear rolled down his cheek. Ms. Rachel had been the only grandmother-like figure in Nikki\u2019s life and the news of her passing was going to break his wife\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cYou still there?\u201d his brother-in-law asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Chris confirmed after clearing his throat. \u201cThanks for calling me, Mikey.\u201d He pulled his phone away from his ear to look at the time and saw that he only had about two hours left until the end of the work week. \u201cI\u2019ll call Ms. Rachel\u2019s son once we wrap for the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me know if there is anything I can do to help,\u201d Mikey told him. \u201cYou or Ms. Rachel\u2019s son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Chris assured him.</p><p>After saying goodbye, Chris dried his face with his hand and then took a minute to compose himself. Once he was ready, he went back into the soundstage and found them rehearsing the scene again. He gave the assistant his phone and then made his way over to the makeup artist on set, knowing he was going to need a touch up.</p><p>While they fussed over his makeup, Chris\u2019s longtime friend Scarlett Johansson made her way over.</p><p>\u201cEverything ok?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>Chris nodded as the makeup team finished touching up his makeup. He knew that Scarlett could tell he wasn\u2019t being honest, but he had to get through the last two hours of their filming schedule and then they would all be off for the weekend.</p><p>Two hours later, Scarlett took the same golf cart as Chris to get back to their trailers and he told her about Ms. Rachel\u2019s passing. Even though his friend had only met the woman a couple times, she still expressed emotion over the loss; after all, she more than anyone knew how close Chris\u2019s family had been to Ms. Rachel as she had visited them in Sudbury a handful of times.</p><p>Before parting ways for the evening, Scarlet told him that she\u2019d take care of their dinner for the next night. He tried to convince her it was ok, but she waved him off, saying that she\u2019d handle it.</p><p>Going into his trailer, Chris changed out of his costume and into the clothes he\u2019d worn that day to the studio. Knowing that his drive home wouldn\u2019t take too long, he sat down on the couch and called Ms. Rachel\u2019s son, Craig, who he\u2019d met in person many times when the son had visited from California with his family.</p><p>During the conversation, Chris learned that Ms. Rachel had passed away peacefully in her sleep and had been discovered by their neighbor Jan, who\u2019d noticed that Ms. Rachel\u2019s cats were acting strangely in the window as if trying to get someone\u2019s attention. It had been Jan who\u2019d called the authorities and then had reached out to Craig to tell him.</p><p>Craig expressed his thanks Chris and their other neighbors who\u2019d watched out for his mom during the last few years. He\u2019d been in a difficult situation with his wife\u2019s parents in California needing care and his mom refusing to leave the east coast. Knowing his mom had had neighbors that treated her like family had made the whole situation easier for them. Before hanging up, Craig promised to keep Chris informed about funeral arrangements and if there was anything he and Nikki could do to help.</p><p>Teary-eyed from the conversation, Chris used a tissue to dry his eyes and then headed out to his car. He used the short drive from the studio to their rental house to mentally prepare himself for the bomb he was going to have to drop in the lap of his wife who was 36-weeks pregnant.</p><p>Pulling into the crowded driveway, Chris spotted Nikki sitting on the porch swing and knew she was waiting for him. He was proved correct when she met him at the top of the steps to the porch with her hands planted on her hips, a minute later.</p><p>\u201cWould you please explain to me why our mothers won\u2019t give me my phone and or look me in the eye?!\u201d she demanded in the short tone she usually reserved for the dogs when they were misbehaving.</p><p>Chris took a deep breath and reached for her hand, but she dodged his first attempt. \u201cPlease, Nik,\u201d he said, his voice cracking. Meeting her eyes, he blinked back the tears that were pooling again.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked, her voice full of emotion. \u201cChris, what\u2019s going on.\u201d She didn\u2019t resist as Chris took her hand and led her over to the porch swing. \u201cChris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got a phone call today,\u201d he started, his voice wavering as all of the emotions he\u2019d kept at bay began to bubble up. \u201cNik, baby, Ms. Rachel -\u201d</p><p>The gut wrenching sob that met his ears told him that his wife had figured out what happened to Ms. Rachel without him having to say that she\u2019d passed. Chris wrapped his arms around her and let his own tears flow freely over the beloved grandmother-figure they\u2019d both lost.</p><p>When there were no more tears to cry, Nikki sniffed and used her thumbs to dry her eyes then chuckled a little when Chris offered her a corner of his shirt to use instead. She shook her head, but leaned back into his embrace, basking in the comfort he was able to give her.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about changing the baby\u2019s name?\u201d she asked, after a few minutes of silence. \u201cI know we\u2019d agreed on Charlotte, but now\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you want to name her after Ms. Rachel?\u201d Chris finished and Nikki nodded. \u201cI love that idea. Same middle name? Marie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel Marie Evans,\u201d Nikki practiced and let out a surprised laugh when she felt the baby kick. \u201cOw.\u201d She rubbed the spot, but laughed. \u201cI think she likes that name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because it\u2019s hers.\u201d Chris placed his hand on top of Nikki\u2019s swollen belly and knew that Ms. Rachel was smiling down on them.</p><hr><p>Want to find me off tumblr?

He used the short drive from the studio to their rental house to mentally prepare himself for the bomb he was going to have to drop in the lap of his wife who was 36-weeks pregnant.</p><p>Pulling into the crowded driveway, Chris spotted Nikki sitting on the porch swing and knew she was waiting for him. He was proved correct when she met him at the top of the steps to the porch with her hands planted on her hips, a minute later.</p><p>\u201cWould you please explain to me why our mothers won\u2019t give me my phone and or look me in the eye?!\u201d she demanded in the short tone she usually reserved for the dogs when they were misbehaving.</p><p>Chris took a deep breath and reached for her hand, but she dodged his first attempt. \u201cPlease, Nik,\u201d he said, his voice cracking. Meeting her eyes, he blinked back the tears that were pooling again.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked, her voice full of emotion. \u201cChris, what\u2019s going on.\u201d She didn\u2019t resist as Chris took her hand and led her over to the porch swing. \u201cChris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got a phone call today,\u201d he started, his voice wavering as all of the emotions he\u2019d kept at bay began to bubble up. \u201cNik, baby, Ms. Rachel -\u201d</p><p>The gut wrenching sob that met his ears told him that his wife had figured out what happened to Ms. Rachel without him having to say that she\u2019d passed. Chris wrapped his arms around her and let his own tears flow freely over the beloved grandmother-figure they\u2019d both lost.</p><p>When there were no more tears to cry, Nikki sniffed and used her thumbs to dry her eyes then chuckled a little when Chris offered her a corner of his shirt to use instead. She shook her head, but leaned back into his embrace, basking in the comfort he was able to give her.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about changing the baby\u2019s name?\u201d she asked, after a few minutes of silence. \u201cI know we\u2019d agreed on Charlotte, but now\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you want to name her after Ms. Rachel?\u201d Chris finished and Nikki nodded. \u201cI love that idea. Same middle name? Marie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel Marie Evans,\u201d Nikki practiced and let out a surprised laugh when she felt the baby kick. \u201cOw.\u201d She rubbed the spot, but laughed. \u201cI think she likes that name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because it\u2019s hers.\u201d Chris placed his hand on top of Nikki\u2019s swollen belly and knew that Ms. Rachel was smiling down on them.</p><hr><p>Want to find me off tumblr?

As if connected, fifty pairs of eyes turned to the production assistant who&rsquo;d been given the important duty of watching Chris&rsquo;s phone while he was on set during the last month of Nikki&rsquo;s pregnancy.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your brother-in-law,&rdquo; the assistant told Chris, after looking at the phone.</p><p>Brow furrowed, Chris made his way over to the assistant and took the phone, unsure as to why Mikey was calling him. Answering the phone, he told his brother-in-law to give him a minute as he made his way out of the soundstage and out into the hot Atlanta sun.</p><p>Of all the people that Chris was expecting to hear from, Mikey wasn&rsquo;t one of them. Typically, when he was on a job, his family members texted him to call them back when he had time, so the fact that Mikey had called made Chris a little nervous, especially since his mom and Nikki&rsquo;s mom were in Atlanta with them.</p><p>&ldquo;Mikey?&rdquo; Chris said into the phone. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Chris,&rdquo; his brother-in-law replied, his tone weary. &ldquo;Sorry for calling you while you were on set, but I needed to call you before you heard from anyone else.&rdquo;</p><p>His words and the pause he took after put Chris on high alert.</p><p>&ldquo;Ms. Rachel passed away last night,&rdquo; his brother-in-law finally said.</p><p>Chris&rsquo;s stomach dropped and he felt tears pool in the corner of his eyes as he thought of his and Nikki&rsquo;s former neighbor. He took a shaky breath and asked, &ldquo;does Nikki know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Mikey stated. &ldquo;I called mom hoping that you were home. When you weren&rsquo;t, I told her to turn Nikki&rsquo;s phone off. Of course, mom demanded to know why, so she and your mom both know. I told them to let you tell Nikki and the boys.&rdquo;</p><p>Chris sniffed as a tear rolled down his cheek. Ms. Rachel had been the only grandmother-like figure in Nikki&rsquo;s life and the news of her passing was going to break his wife&rsquo;s heart.</p><p>&ldquo;You still there?&rdquo; his brother-in-law asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Chris confirmed after clearing his throat. &ldquo;Thanks for calling me, Mikey.&rdquo; He pulled his phone away from his ear to look at the time and saw that he only had about two hours left until the end of the work week. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call Ms. Rachel&rsquo;s son once we wrap for the day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let me know if there is anything I can do to help,&rdquo; Mikey told him. &ldquo;You or Ms. Rachel&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; Chris assured him.</p><p>After saying goodbye, Chris dried his face with his hand and then took a minute to compose himself. Once he was ready, he went back into the soundstage and found them rehearsing the scene again. He gave the assistant his phone and then made his way over to the makeup artist on set, knowing he was going to need a touch up.</p><p>While they fussed over his makeup, Chris&rsquo;s longtime friend Scarlett Johansson made her way over.</p><p>&ldquo;Everything ok?&rdquo; she asked him.</p><p>Chris nodded as the makeup team finished touching up his makeup. He knew that Scarlett could tell he wasn&rsquo;t being honest, but he had to get through the last two hours of their filming schedule and then they would all be off for the weekend.</p><p>Two hours later, Scarlett took the same golf cart as Chris to get back to their trailers and he told her about Ms. Rachel&rsquo;s passing. Even though his friend had only met the woman a couple times, she still expressed emotion over the loss; after all, she more than anyone knew how close Chris&rsquo;s family had been to Ms. Rachel as she had visited them in Sudbury a handful of times.</p><p>Before parting ways for the evening, Scarlet told him that she&rsquo;d take care of their dinner for the next night. He tried to convince her it was ok, but she waved him off, saying that she&rsquo;d handle it.</p><p>Going into his trailer, Chris changed out of his costume and into the clothes he&rsquo;d worn that day to the studio. Knowing that his drive home wouldn&rsquo;t take too long, he sat down on the couch and called Ms. Rachel&rsquo;s son, Craig, who he&rsquo;d met in person many times when the son had visited from California with his family.</p><p>During the conversation, Chris learned that Ms. Rachel had passed away peacefully in her sleep and had been discovered by their neighbor Jan, who&rsquo;d noticed that Ms. Rachel&rsquo;s cats were acting strangely in the window as if trying to get someone&rsquo;s attention. It had been Jan who&rsquo;d called the authorities and then had reached out to Craig to tell him.</p><p>Craig expressed his thanks Chris and their other neighbors who&rsquo;d watched out for his mom during the last few years. He&rsquo;d been in a difficult situation with his wife&rsquo;s parents in California needing care and his mom refusing to leave the east coast. Knowing his mom had had neighbors that treated her like family had made the whole situation easier for them. Before hanging up, Craig promised to keep Chris informed about funeral arrangements and if there was anything he and Nikki could do to help.</p><p>Teary-eyed from the conversation, Chris used a tissue to dry his eyes and then headed out to his car. He used the short drive from the studio to their rental house to mentally prepare himself for the bomb he was going to have to drop in the lap of his wife who was 36-weeks pregnant.</p><p>Pulling into the crowded driveway, Chris spotted Nikki sitting on the porch swing and knew she was waiting for him. He was proved correct when she met him at the top of the steps to the porch with her hands planted on her hips, a minute later.</p><p>&ldquo;Would you please explain to me why our mothers won&rsquo;t give me my phone and or look me in the eye?!&rdquo; she demanded in the short tone she usually reserved for the dogs when they were misbehaving.</p><p>Chris took a deep breath and reached for her hand, but she dodged his first attempt. &ldquo;Please, Nik,&rdquo; he said, his voice cracking. Meeting her eyes, he blinked back the tears that were pooling again.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked, her voice full of emotion. &ldquo;Chris, what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t resist as Chris took her hand and led her over to the porch swing. &ldquo;Chris?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I got a phone call today,&rdquo; he started, his voice wavering as all of the emotions he&rsquo;d kept at bay began to bubble up. &ldquo;Nik, baby, Ms. Rachel -&rdquo;</p><p>The gut wrenching sob that met his ears told him that his wife had figured out what happened to Ms. Rachel without him having to say that she&rsquo;d passed.
