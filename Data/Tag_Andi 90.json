Sorry, I guess.</li><li>When he leaves and closes the door, Cyrus cries quietly, because he\u2019s lost his only true friend</li><li>See, what had happened was that he was talking to a few of his friends about TJ, and they were teasing him about his obvious crush on the boy</li><li>But not in a playful way. They were making him feel bad about liking another boy, so they had pretty much cut ties that day</li><li>In short, Cyrus had nobody</li><li>A few days go by without TJ walking with him to class, or asking him if he\u2019d finished a certain book</li><li>TJ ends up in the library one day when he\u2019s supposed to talk to Cyrus, but he already knows he\u2019ll say know, so he flicks through the library\u2019s copy of\u00a0 The Glass Menagerie</li><li>Cyrus ends up going to the library as well, unbeknownst to TJ, and approaches him</li><li><b>Cyrus:</b> \n\nTime is the longest distance between two places.</li><li><b>TJ, jumping a little:</b> Oh, hey. Nice quote.</li><li><b>Cyrus:</b> Good choice of a play.</li><li>There\u2019s a bit of silence before they speak again.</li><li><b>Cyrus: </b>I\u2019m sorry I yelled at you that day.

You\u2019re so great to be around.</li><li><b>Cyrus, blushing lightly:</b> Thanks that&hellip;means a lot. They, uh, they kind of found out that&hellip;that I\u2019m gay.</li><li><b>TJ:</b> Cyrus, they\u2019re assholes for cutting ties because of that. You\u2019re still the same literature nerd you\u2019ve always been.</li><li><b>Cyrus:</b> I\u2019m glad I told you.</li><li><b>TJ:</b> Me too.</li><li>They hug in reconciliation, and in that moment, TJ realizes that he doesn\u2019t really want to let go for a while, but that would be weird, so he does</li><li>They spend the rest of the day talking about the books they read while they weren\u2019t together</li><li>So things have gone mostly back to the way they were. Every now and again TJ and Cyrus try and sit with more people during lunch, but they end up having their own conversation</li><li>So they start having lunch in the courtyard by the big oak tree when it\u2019s nice outside</li><li>One time it starts raining, and neither of them expected it, but TJ had a jacket, which he gave to Cyrus to cover himself</li><li>When they get inside, TJ\u2019s hair is a damp mess, and Cyrus decides he likes it best this way</li><li>Also TJ never gets his jacket back</li><li>The next few weeks go great, and the two of them are hanging out so much that other people wonder if they\u2019re dating or not</li><li>One day, after reading the Great Gatsby for the millionth time, Cyrus decides to just suck it up and ask TJ on a date</li><li>Except he doesn\u2019t know how</li><li>So, he does what any logical literature nerd would do: he copies down all the best love lines from TJ\u2019s favorite books</li><li>He picks a day when they talk about books to do it, so it doesn\u2019t seem to out of the ordinary</li><li><b>TJ:</b> Okay, so I just finished reading Huck Finn, and I already-</li><li><b>Cyrus:</b> Actually, is it okay if I go first today?</li><li><b>TJ:</b> Yeah, sure.</li><li><b>Cyrus:</b> \n\nI was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.</li><li><b>TJ:</b> You read Gatsby again?</li><li><b>Cyrus, shaking his head:</b> No, just listen.</li><li><b>Cyrus:</b> \n\nA line can be straight, or a street, but the human heart, oh, no, it&rsquo;s curved like a road through mountains.</li><li><b>TJ:</b> Streetcar Named Desire, right? I love that quote.</li><li><b>Cyrus, sighing:</b> Dammit, TJ, I like you.</li><li><b>TJ, taken aback:</b> Wait, what?</li><li><b>Cyrus: </b>I thought that maybe if I dropped a few romantic literary lines you\u2019d pick up on it. Guess I was wrong.</li><li>And Cyrus is pretty discouraged at this point, but TJ just places his hand on top of Cyrus\u2019</li><li><b>TJ:</b> \n\nThat is part of the beauty of all literature. You discover that your longings are universal longings, that you&rsquo;re not lonely and isolated from anyone. You belong.</li><li>They smile at each other like dorks, and spend the rest of the afternoon sitting there together, hands intertwined</li><li>Cyrus asks TJ to go on a date the next day, and of course he says yes</li><li>Where do they go, you might ask?</li><li>They go to the local library (not the one in the school) and pick out books for each other. Then they go back to their dorms and one reads while the other sits there</li><li>They take turns, and after a little while, none of them can concentrate on the book because <i>oh my gosh they\u2019re on a date.</i></li><li><b>Cyrus:</b> Hey TJ?</li><li><b>TJ:</b> Mhm?</li><li><b>Cyrus:</b> Can I kiss you?</li><li><b>TJ, flustered:</b> I don\u2019t know, <i>can</i> you?</li><li>And he can, Cyrus can and does kiss him</li><li><b>Cyrus:</b> Yeah, I think so<br/></li></ul>",

It was probably small a little while ago, but now that he\u2019s admitted it to himself, it seems to be the only thing his mind can focus on</li><li>One time during a history lecture, he was staring at the back of TJ\u2019s head, and when the teacher asked for the name of a battle, his response was \u201ccute\u201d</li><li>TJ did not let go of that for a whole week, but he didn\u2019t know it was because of him</li><li>As Cyrus\u2019 crush becomes more of a problem, as hanging out with TJ makes him more flustered, he starts to push him a way a little</li><li>It\u2019s not a major thing at first, just little excuses to miss a literature chat every now and again</li><li>And maybe he doesn\u2019t show up to many of his games anymore</li><li>TJ starts to worry that he did something wrong, and so he tries to find Cyrus, but the boy is really good at avoiding him</li><li>One day, he finds him curled up in his room under a blanket, looking severely distressed, so he comes in without even asking</li><li><b>TJ:</b> Are you okay?</li><li><b>Cyrus, snapping</b>: Yeah, I\u2019m fine. I don\u2019t need help.</li><li><b>TJ</b>: You look like you\u2019re about to cry.</li><li><b>Cyrus, voice breaking</b>: I\u2019m <i>not</i>! Everything\u2019s fine, just leave me alone!</li><li><b>TJ, taking a step back:</b> Okay. Sorry, I guess.</li><li>When he leaves and closes the door, Cyrus cries quietly, because he\u2019s lost his only true friend</li><li>See, what had happened was that he was talking to a few of his friends about TJ, and they were teasing him about his obvious crush on the boy</li><li>But not in a playful way. They were making him feel bad about liking another boy, so they had pretty much cut ties that day</li><li>In short, Cyrus had nobody</li><li>A few days go by without TJ walking with him to class, or asking him if he\u2019d finished a certain book</li><li>TJ ends up in the library one day when he\u2019s supposed to talk to Cyrus, but he already knows he\u2019ll say know, so he flicks through the library\u2019s copy of\u00a0 The Glass Menagerie</li><li>Cyrus ends up going to the library as well, unbeknownst to TJ, and approaches him</li><li><b>Cyrus:</b> \n\nTime is the longest distance between two places.</li><li><b>TJ, jumping a little:</b> Oh, hey. Nice quote.</li><li><b>Cyrus:</b> Good choice of a play.</li><li>There\u2019s a bit of silence before they speak again.</li><li><b>Cyrus: </b>I\u2019m sorry I yelled at you that day.

Don&rsquo;t worry, I won&rsquo;t tell your chess buddies.</li><li>Cyrus doesn&rsquo;t know what comes over him, but he lets TJ come into his room, and the posters on his wall that you can&rsquo;t see when you walk in are covered in little tidbits of writing and literature.</li><li><b>TJ:</b> And you called <i>me</i> a nerd.</li><li><b>Cyrus:</b> I&rsquo;m not a nerd, I just have passions.</li><li><b>TJ:</b> I&rsquo;m teasing, I think it&rsquo;s nice. Haven&rsquo;t met someone who likes literature as much as I do.</li><li>They make it an unofficial official thing to meet up on Saturdays in Cyrus&rsquo; room to talk about either the book that they&rsquo;re reading in their literature class or one that they read for fun.</li><li>Cyrus discovers that TJ is a theatre person like himself, considering he reads a lot of plays</li><li>TJ learns that Cyrus never reads without a pencil in his hand to underline things that he liked, or to make notes in the margins of the pages</li><li>One day Cyrus repaints part of his room (the accent wall, if you will) so they hang out in TJ&rsquo;s room while it dries</li><li>And that&rsquo;s when he sees that TJ&rsquo;s really into basketball as well</li><li><b>Cyrus:</b> So, you&rsquo;re a sports guy?</li><li><b>TJ: </b>More like a sport guy. Singular.</li><li><b>Cyrus:</b> I can&rsquo;t play to save my life.</li><li>Cyrus isn&rsquo;t sure why he&rsquo;s suddenly opening up to this new person, considering he hasn&rsquo;t known him that long, but every time he tries to say something snarky, it comes out as more teasing and flirty rather than rude</li><li>Winter comes along, which means basketball season, and Cyrus finds himself watching one of TJ&rsquo;s games.</li><li>It is in this moment, looking at him seem almost effortless on the court, while parts of his hair fall over his forehead, that he realizes he has a small crush on TJ</li><li>Well, not that small. It was probably small a little while ago, but now that he&rsquo;s admitted it to himself, it seems to be the only thing his mind can focus on</li><li>One time during a history lecture, he was staring at the back of TJ&rsquo;s head, and when the teacher asked for the name of a battle, his response was &ldquo;cute&rdquo;</li><li>TJ did not let go of that for a whole week, but he didn&rsquo;t know it was because of him</li><li>As Cyrus&rsquo; crush becomes more of a problem, as hanging out with TJ makes him more flustered, he starts to push him a way a little</li><li>It&rsquo;s not a major thing at first, just little excuses to miss a literature chat every now and again</li><li>And maybe he doesn&rsquo;t show up to many of his games anymore</li><li>TJ starts to worry that he did something wrong, and so he tries to find Cyrus, but the boy is really good at avoiding him</li><li>One day, he finds him curled up in his room under a blanket, looking severely distressed, so he comes in without even asking</li><li><b>TJ:</b> Are you okay?</li><li><b>Cyrus, snapping</b>: Yeah, I&rsquo;m fine. I don&rsquo;t need help.</li><li><b>TJ</b>: You look like you&rsquo;re about to cry.</li><li><b>Cyrus, voice breaking</b>: I&rsquo;m <i>not</i>! Everything&rsquo;s fine, just leave me alone!</li><li><b>TJ, taking a step back:</b> Okay. Sorry, I guess.</li><li>When he leaves and closes the door, Cyrus cries quietly, because he&rsquo;s lost his only true friend</li><li>See, what had happened was that he was talking to a few of his friends about TJ, and they were teasing him about his obvious crush on the boy</li><li>But not in a playful way. They were making him feel bad about liking another boy, so they had pretty much cut ties that day</li><li>In short, Cyrus had nobody</li><li>A few days go by without TJ walking with him to class, or asking him if he&rsquo;d finished a certain book</li><li>TJ ends up in the library one day when he&rsquo;s supposed to talk to Cyrus, but he already knows he&rsquo;ll say know, so he flicks through the library&rsquo;s copy of&nbsp; The Glass Menagerie</li><li>Cyrus ends up going to the library as well, unbeknownst to TJ, and approaches him</li><li><b>Cyrus:</b> \n\nTime is the longest distance between two places.</li><li><b>TJ, jumping a little:</b> Oh, hey. Nice quote.</li><li><b>Cyrus:</b> Good choice of a play.</li><li>There&rsquo;s a bit of silence before they speak again.</li><li><b>Cyrus: </b>I&rsquo;m sorry I yelled at you that day. I&rsquo;ve just&hellip;had a lot going on.</li><li><b>TJ:</b> It&rsquo;s fine. Everything okay?</li><li><b>Cyrus, shaking his head:</b> My friends cut ties with me.</li><li><b>TJ:</b> What, why? You&rsquo;re so great to be around.</li><li><b>Cyrus, blushing lightly:</b> Thanks that&hellip;means a lot. They, uh, they kind of found out that&hellip;that I&rsquo;m gay.</li><li><b>TJ:</b> Cyrus, they&rsquo;re assholes for cutting ties because of that. You&rsquo;re still the same literature nerd you&rsquo;ve always been.</li><li><b>Cyrus:</b> I&rsquo;m glad I told you.</li><li><b>TJ:</b> Me too.</li><li>They hug in reconciliation, and in that moment, TJ realizes that he doesn&rsquo;t really want to let go for a while, but that would be weird, so he does</li><li>They spend the rest of the day talking about the books they read while they weren&rsquo;t together</li><li>So things have gone mostly back to the way they were. Every now and again TJ and Cyrus try and sit with more people during lunch, but they end up having their own conversation</li><li>So they start having lunch in the courtyard by the big oak tree when it&rsquo;s nice outside</li><li>One time it starts raining, and neither of them expected it, but TJ had a jacket, which he gave to Cyrus to cover himself</li><li>When they get inside, TJ&rsquo;s hair is a damp mess, and Cyrus decides he likes it best this way</li><li>Also TJ never gets his jacket back</li><li>The next few weeks go great, and the two of them are hanging out so much that other people wonder if they&rsquo;re dating or not</li><li>One day, after reading the Great Gatsby for the millionth time, Cyrus decides to just suck it up and ask TJ on a date</li><li>Except he doesn&rsquo;t know how</li><li>So, he does what any logical literature nerd would do: he copies down all the best love lines from TJ&rsquo;s favorite books</li><li>He picks a day when they talk about books to do it, so it doesn&rsquo;t seem to out of the ordinary</li><li><b>TJ:</b> Okay, so I just finished reading Huck Finn, and I already-</li><li><b>Cyrus:</b> Actually, is it okay if I go first today?</li><li><b>TJ:</b> Yeah, sure.</li><li><b>Cyrus:</b> \n\nI was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.</li><li><b>TJ:</b> You read Gatsby again?</li><li><b>Cyrus, shaking his head:</b> No, just listen.</li><li><b>Cyrus:</b> \n\nA line can be straight, or a street, but the human heart, oh, no, it&rsquo;s curved like a road through mountains.</li><li><b>TJ:</b> Streetcar Named Desire, right? I love that quote.</li><li><b>Cyrus, sighing:</b> Dammit, TJ, I like you.</li><li><b>TJ, taken aback:</b> Wait, what?</li><li><b>Cyrus: </b>I thought that maybe if I dropped a few romantic literary lines you&rsquo;d pick up on it. Guess I was wrong.</li><li>And Cyrus is pretty discouraged at this point, but TJ just places his hand on top of Cyrus&rsquo;</li><li><b>TJ:</b> \n\nThat is part of the beauty of all literature. You discover that your longings are universal longings, that you&rsquo;re not lonely and isolated from anyone. You belong.</li><li>They smile at each other like dorks, and spend the rest of the afternoon sitting there together, hands intertwined</li><li>Cyrus asks TJ to go on a date the next day, and of course he says yes</li><li>Where do they go, you might ask?</li><li>They go to the local library (not the one in the school) and pick out books for each other. Then they go back to their dorms and one reads while the other sits there</li><li>They take turns, and after a little while, none of them can concentrate on the book because <i>oh my gosh they&rsquo;re on a date.</i></li><li><b>Cyrus:</b> Hey TJ?</li><li><b>TJ:</b> Mhm?</li><li><b>Cyrus:</b> Can I kiss you?</li><li><b>TJ, flustered:</b> I don&rsquo;t know, <i>can</i> you?</li><li>And he can, Cyrus can and does kiss him</li><li><b>Cyrus:</b> Yeah, I think so<br /></li></ul></p>",
