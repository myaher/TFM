That&rsquo;s all it took for Seokjin to break down crying. When Jimin told you, you knew you had to take her to see him.</p><p>At seven years old, it was hard for your daughter, too, but she is at least old enough now to understand why her appa was away all the time. Doesn&rsquo;t mean the pain didn&rsquo;t come out of her eyes.</p><p>She couldn&rsquo;t wait to see him after so long. You two were supposed to see Jin before the concert because Jimin wasn&rsquo;t sure if he could fake more smiles to surprise him after.</p><p>Sneaking up behind him, your daughter wraps her arms around his waist.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he says in shock, &ldquo;Princess! I&rsquo;ve missed you!&rdquo;</p><p>Picking her up and spinning around, Seokjin met with another present: a flower crown.</p><p>&ldquo;I made it for you, Appa. Do you like it?&rdquo; she shyly asks.</p><p>&ldquo;I love it. I love you, too.&rdquo;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"158\" data-orig-width=\"240\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c3d54408eef55fb22e7f24388ea5c9da/tumblr_inline_p9z5zrbqts1vh8him_250.gif\" data-orig-height=\"158\" data-orig-width=\"240\"/></figure><h2>Min Yoongi</h2><p>Telling Yoongi that you were coming to a concert and being unable to keep the promise was your worst fear. Whether it be for his sake or your five year old&rsquo;s, breaking either of their hearts would break yours.</p><p>So you decided the surprise would be for both of them. Walking into the stadium is when your daughter saw the BTS t-shirts. Now it was just Yoongi who didn&rsquo;t know. You wondered if he would also bounce like she did.</p><p>You were wrong. Namjoon was the only member that knew beforehand. Just when the time was right, he told his hyung to look at your direction. Almost immediately after realizing, Yoongi&rsquo;s face was covered in tears.</p><p>Eventually, he calmed down enough to wave at the bouncing girl, but Hoseok had to tell the audience who was here. Collective coos of joy were followed by Yoongi speaking.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for being here. You have changed my life in such incredible ways. I love you.&rdquo;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"270\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/691cf6d99b4b597e9df0b1af0856e9b5/tumblr_inline_p9z5zsqHJi1vh8him_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"270\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><h2>Jung Hoseok</h2><p>Safe to say, your three year old has a wild imagination. Of course, with her dad being who he is, it didn&rsquo;t shock anyone. It was especially cute when she called Hoseok a &ldquo;singing astronaut&rdquo;.</p><p>It all began when you showed your daughter the &lsquo;Daydream&rsquo; music video. She is dead set on believing that J-Hope is his space name, no matter what you told her.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why, when you took her to an arena instead of a space station for the concert, she was a little surprised. Not to mention her father was, too.</p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s my sunshine?&rdquo;</p><p>She doesn&rsquo;t hear him because she&rsquo;s looking around in awe. After a while, she asks him a question instead of answering his, pointing at the crowd she can see through the curtains.</p><p>&ldquo;Appa, are those lights stars?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No, but it looks like the sky sometimes.&rdquo;</p><p>Giggling, your daughter&rsquo;s distracted for a moment. Hoseok whispers in your ear:</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s so cute. Thank you for bringing her.&rdquo;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"280\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e6bea38418196f57e772fcf370bf9d97/tumblr_inline_p9z5zrAwkg1vh8him_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"280\" data-orig-width=\"268\"/></figure><h2>Kim Namjoon</h2><p>Your six year old daughter always found early videos of Namjoon hysterical. There&rsquo;s no way that her goofy appa was ever able to look intimidating. He loved hearing that.</p><p>Performing for your little girl at home was one of his favorite hobbies, so you finally brought her to a show. It&rsquo;s her first concert to be exact.</p><p>The thing is, you didn&rsquo;t tell Joon. So there he was, on stage in front of thousands, doing a dorky stunt with one of the boys. This is even before he realized you were there.</p><p>&ldquo;Appa and Uncle Jinnie are funny grown-ups.&rdquo;</p><p>You had to agree with her. Of course, once Namjoon saw you both, you could tell he wanted to cry. Knowing your daughter, however, she would be worried if she saw tears, so he just got weirder. He was even worse than the maknaes. Everyone loved it, though.</p><p>After the show, she took Namjoon&rsquo;s face in her hands and said:</p><p>&ldquo;I can teach you how to be serious, appa.&rdquo;</p><p>No one knows how he kept a straight expression.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"295\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3dddab718cf53a8308863c7f2e8e3341/tumblr_inline_pa0o2pC5qL1vh8him_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"295\" data-orig-width=\"268\"/></figure><h2>Park Jimin</h2><p>It was possible that everyone knew that your four year old daughter would have more charms than even her father, but it was never directly spoken of. And just like Jimin, she knows how to use it to her advantage.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why, when you brought up that you were going to surprise him at a concert, she picked out her very best outfit. <i>She</i> wanted to give a performance and show her appa what she learned in dance class.</p><p>You hadn&rsquo;t even thought to tell her she couldn&rsquo;t go on stage. When the day came, she bursts backstage, ready for her makeup. Jimin couldn&rsquo;t believe it.</p><p>&ldquo;You look so pretty! What are you dressed up for, angel?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to dance for you!&rdquo; she says proudly, &ldquo;In front of everyone!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really? Let&rsquo;s see what you have first,&rdquo; he laughs.</p><p>You give him a small look.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe in a few years, though.&rdquo;</p><p>No one can resist her cuteness, not even the original cutie himself.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"181\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/14c2a1563540d5ccba220cad03b74144/tumblr_inline_pa0o2nuhbj1vh8him_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"181\" data-orig-width=\"268\"/></figure><h2>Kim Taehyung</h2><p>Out of all the boys, it was said that Tae would be the best father. He didn&rsquo;t think so. Maybe Seokjin or Hoseok but not him. It&rsquo;s his biggest insecurity, you&rsquo;ve come to learn. Which was crazy to you. Until you talked to him one night.</p><p>Since your daughter was born two years ago, Taehyung has spent nearly five hundred days on the road. He isn&rsquo;t there enough and she is going to forget him, he told you. Obviously, you always Skyped him and played his music for her, but that didn&rsquo;t reassure Tae at all. So you hatched an idea.</p><p>Painting is her specialty. Not that the &ldquo;I love you, Appa&rdquo; on the sign was visible when she was down with her personal touches, but it&rsquo;s the thought that counts. You just to write it on your own poster to hold.</p><p>When he saw it, his eyes lit up. The seats you had weren&rsquo;t even that good and you could see it. He was the last to speak during the ending speeches and he used part of it to talk to you two.</p><p>&ldquo;My loves. Thank you so much for loving me and coming here. I promise to do better.&rdquo;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"310\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/855e97079ce0e40ffcbf77de3c73af22/tumblr_inline_pa0o2mZbjh1vh8him_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"310\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><h2>Jeon Jungkook</h2><p>Neither of you had planned on having a child, it just happened. Still, here you are, a little over a year after your little girl turned one. Jungkook has only one regret: missing every first with her.</p><p>Her first crawl, walk, and tooth were all missed because of his schedules. As you told him over the phone about her babbles, he was concerned that her first word would also be without him. You weren&rsquo;t having any of it.</p><p>Packing enough for a week&rsquo;s time, you head for his next tour location. If anything, BTS would be her first concert. On the plane ride, you talked to her:</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, sweetheart. I know I shouldn&rsquo;t say this, but wait to talk. For Appa.&rdquo;</p><p>He was so happy to see you both, but he had to get ready, meaning he couldn&rsquo;t hold her for long. Giving her back to you, he sighed deeply. It wasn&rsquo;t a minute, though, until she started protesting.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah. Ah. Pa. Pa.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wha-What?&rdquo; Jungkook turns his head sharply, stuttering through tears.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah. Pa.

That\u2019s all it took for Seokjin to break down crying. When Jimin told you, you knew you had to take her to see him.</p><p>At seven years old, it was hard for your daughter, too, but she is at least old enough now to understand why her appa was away all the time. Doesn\u2019t mean the pain didn\u2019t come out of her eyes.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t wait to see him after so long. You two were supposed to see Jin before the concert because Jimin wasn\u2019t sure if he could fake more smiles to surprise him after.</p><p>Sneaking up behind him, your daughter wraps her arms around his waist.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he says in shock, \u201cPrincess! I\u2019ve missed you!\u201d</p><p>Picking her up and spinning around, Seokjin met with another present: a flower crown.</p><p>\u201cI made it for you, Appa. Do you like it?\u201d she shyly asks.</p><p>\u201cI love it. I love you, too.\u201d</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"158\" data-orig-width=\"240\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c3d54408eef55fb22e7f24388ea5c9da/tumblr_inline_p9z5zrbqts1vh8him_250.gif\" data-orig-height=\"158\" data-orig-width=\"240\"></figure><h2>Min Yoongi</h2><p>Telling Yoongi that you were coming to a concert and being unable to keep the promise was your worst fear. Whether it be for his sake or your five year old\u2019s, breaking either of their hearts would break yours.</p><p>So you decided the surprise would be for both of them. Walking into the stadium is when your daughter saw the BTS t-shirts. Now it was just Yoongi who didn\u2019t know. You wondered if he would also bounce like she did.</p><p>You were wrong. Namjoon was the only member that knew beforehand. Just when the time was right, he told his hyung to look at your direction. Almost immediately after realizing, Yoongi\u2019s face was covered in tears.</p><p>Eventually, he calmed down enough to wave at the bouncing girl, but Hoseok had to tell the audience who was here. Collective coos of joy were followed by Yoongi speaking.</p><p>\u201cThank you for being here. You have changed my life in such incredible ways.

Of course, with her dad being who he is, it didn\u2019t shock anyone. It was especially cute when she called Hoseok a \u201csinging astronaut\u201d.</p><p>It all began when you showed your daughter the \u2018Daydream\u2019 music video. She is dead set on believing that J-Hope is his space name, no matter what you told her.</p><p>That\u2019s why, when you took her to an arena instead of a space station for the concert, she was a little surprised. Not to mention her father was, too.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s my sunshine?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t hear him because she\u2019s looking around in awe. After a while, she asks him a question instead of answering his, pointing at the crowd she can see through the curtains.</p><p>\u201cAppa, are those lights stars?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, but it looks like the sky sometimes.\u201d</p><p>Giggling, your daughter\u2019s distracted for a moment.

It\u2019s her first concert to be exact.</p><p>The thing is, you didn\u2019t tell Joon. So there he was, on stage in front of thousands, doing a dorky stunt with one of the boys. This is even before he realized you were there.</p><p>\u201cAppa and Uncle Jinnie are funny grown-ups.\u201d</p><p>You had to agree with her. Of course, once Namjoon saw you both, you could tell he wanted to cry. Knowing your daughter, however, she would be worried if she saw tears, so he just got weirder. He was even worse than the maknaes. Everyone loved it, though.</p><p>After the show, she took Namjoon\u2019s face in her hands and said:</p><p>\u201cI can teach you how to be serious, appa.\u201d</p><p>No one knows how he kept a straight expression.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"295\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3dddab718cf53a8308863c7f2e8e3341/tumblr_inline_pa0o2pC5qL1vh8him_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"295\" data-orig-width=\"268\"></figure><h2>Park Jimin</h2><p>It was possible that everyone knew that your four year old daughter would have more charms than even her father, but it was never directly spoken of.

When the day came, she bursts backstage, ready for her makeup. Jimin couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><p>\u201cYou look so pretty!

SO: if you do get upset over it, don\u2019t attack that idol, don\u2019t attack their partner. Just leave it alone and let them be and everything will be fine. Just be respectful yall thats my point here mostly. Support your idols decisions and dont just drop them cuz they found someone to make them happy.</p>",
