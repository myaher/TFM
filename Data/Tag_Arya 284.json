It might be that she was never especially interested, perhaps a tomboy from birth.

Arya says she doesn\u2019t want to be a lady? Alright, but who\u2019s going to fix holes in her clothes for her then - she can learn more practical needlework!

As she muses in her first chapter:</p><p><i>It wasn\u2019t fair. Sansa had everything. Sansa was two years older; maybe by the time Arya had been born, there had been nothing left.

And maybe Sansa has natural talent that Arya has observed and envies, but that\u2019s not everything. A caring teacher (who only really has two pupils!) can sit down with her, observe her at her work and see what she\u2019s doing wrong or offer helpful pointers! And feed her interest as above! She\u2019s not so bothered about pretty floral patterns? Do a pattern of direwolves and swords! <i>Not everyone is Sansa!</i> Has Septa Mordane even noticed that Arya\u2019s left-handed? Is that why she struggles so much with some things?</p><p>Really, the girl needs her confidence boosted. I expect she may come off as confident because of how she bucks the normal rules, but from in her head we can see how much she\u2019s really struggling with her self-esteem and position in society.</p><p>And I imagine Septa Mordane probably feels under pressure - here she is, employed by one of the highest lords of the land to make their daughters into ladies, and she\u2019s only managing 50%! Maybe she feels like she can\u2019t veer outside of the standard lessons and methods in case the parents disapprove, but she\u2019s told Catelyn about Arya\u2019s difficulties, I\u2019m sure if she had ideas to help or fix the situation Cat and Ned could be open-minded (after all, Ned hires Syrio in OTL). They love their daughter, and they believe her getting those skills will be for her overall benefit.</p><p><br/></p><p>I just&hellip; don\u2019t understand how somebody tasked with educating <i>two</i> children (I know it seems like Jeyne Poole and Beth Cassel join in at times, but I doubt they\u2019re a real focus in comparison) can be critically failing one of the two children this ridiculously badly.

A caring teacher (who only really has two pupils!) can sit down with her, observe her at her work and see what she\u2019s doing wrong or offer helpful pointers! And feed her interest as above! She\u2019s not so bothered about pretty floral patterns? Do a pattern of direwolves and swords! <i>Not everyone is Sansa!</i> Has Septa Mordane even noticed that Arya\u2019s left-handed?

Maybe she feels like she can\u2019t veer outside of the standard lessons and methods in case the parents disapprove, but she\u2019s told Catelyn about Arya\u2019s difficulties, I\u2019m sure if she had ideas to help or fix the situation Cat and Ned could be open-minded (after all, Ned hires Syrio in OTL).

I\nbelieve that Jon Snow will be the King by the end of this story and will marry\nhis cousin Sansa Stark. And I think this marriage will unite the Kingdom, bringing peace to a nation destroyed by years of wars.But I dont believe the North will ever bend the knee to the south again. The North independence has been a topic since book 1 and it is still a important issue in the story. I believe the North will be reunited with the rest of the Westeros by a marrigae alliance, like Dorne was in the past. And the kingdom will be able to keep part of their independence and the Tittles of King and Queen in the Norh, like Dorne was able to keep in the past the titles of Princes and Princesses.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p>\u201c\ufeffIts the dragons that we married\nand the dragons are all dead.\u201d</p><p>\n\nCatelyn XI - AGOT</p><p><br/></p></blockquote><p>_______________________________________________________________</p><blockquote><p>You might have knelt, damn you.

Both live for some time among smallfolk. Both\ntraveled around Westeros alongside a hedge Knight/soldier. Both are last in\nline to inherit among their sibling. Both serve as cupbearers at some point.\nBoth are insolent&nbsp;and witty in their responses. Both are adventure\nseekers. Both are implicated in an incident of \"assaulting&rdquo; a member\nof the royal family, though Arya does the deed herself while Egg calls for\nDunk&rsquo;s intervention. &nbsp;Both were unlikely\nto end up as King or Queen. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9297104892701461ba194b2ee03af372/tumblr_inline_pf4f7oNJv81sgp768_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Now, as many of you may know. I\nbelieve that Jon Snow will be the King by the end of this story and will marry\nhis cousin Sansa Stark. And I think this marriage will unite the Kingdom, bringing peace to a nation destroyed by years of wars.But I dont believe the North will ever bend the knee to the south again. The North independence has been a topic since book 1 and it is still a important issue in the story. I believe the North will be reunited with the rest of the Westeros by a marrigae alliance, like Dorne was in the past. And the kingdom will be able to keep part of their independence and the Tittles of King and Queen in the Norh, like Dorne was able to keep in the past the titles of Princes and Princesses.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;&#65279;Its the dragons that we married\nand the dragons are all dead.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\nCatelyn XI - AGOT</p><p><br /></p></blockquote><p>_______________________________________________________________</p><blockquote><p>You might have knelt, damn you.
