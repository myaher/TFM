I was wondering if you\u2019d like to write a fic where either of them are in the mood for tickles and the other one pretends to not notice then the lee genuinely gets sad so the ler feels bad and tickles them to pieces? I hope you\u2019re having a lovely day! ~featheryphan",
        "answer": "<p>Aw thank you! I\u2019m sorry you had a bad brain night, I know exactly how that feels. I assumed that you meant Dan and Phil for this fic, hopefully you like it!!\u00a0</p><p>______________________________________</p><p>Dan and Phil knew each other inside and out, most of the time they didn\u2019t even need to talk, they just made eye contact and instantly knew what the latter was thinking.</p><p>Rather early into their friendship, they realized that they could get quite needy when it came to physical affection. It wasn\u2019t out of romance, more from the fact that they trusted each other and everyone needed a hug every once in a while. They started out with sitting closer to each other on the couch, giving each other pokes in the side and gently bumping into one another, and now their new thing was playful tickle fights. </p><p>Phil was more direct with his wants and stretched his feet out on Dan\u2019s lap for a couple scribbles on the soles of his feet. Dan was shyer when he craved attention and acted like a brat or tried to start a tickle fight by poking his best friend in the belly. Phil thought it was absolutely adorable and sometimes when he felt mean, he pretended not to notice Dan\u2019s subtle hints to make him squirm with anticipation. </p><p>Dan felt like his brain was going to explode. He was drowning in homework and exams were coming up, he really struggled with making friends in uni and felt like he was absolutely alone. Phil was a great person to talk to, but he was already done with school and didn\u2019t really remember the stress and pressure of doing well in class. Dan was rapidly losing interest in studying law and that didn\u2019t help with his motivation, his friends all suggested to change his course of study but he knew deep down inside he didn\u2019t want to go to uni anymore, and he was absolutely terrified of being considered a failure. </p><p>The young YouTuber stared at the piles of homework strewn all over his bedroom floor. All the information he was trying to cram into his head was becoming a jumbled up mess and the more he tried to study, the more he felt anxious and overwhelmed. He knew he needed to take a break now or else he was going to crumble into a depressed mess on the ground. </p><p><i>Wonder what Phil\u2019s doing, </i>he wondered, getting up and leaving his room for the first time in hours. He heard the faint sounds of an anime coming from the living room, upon entering the room he saw his best friend Phil watching some old episodes of Haikyuu. </p><p>\u201cWhat episode is this?\u201d Dan plopped on the couch next to him and helped himself to a handful of crisps. </p><p>\u201cFirst one of season 3,\u201d he took a big swig of his tea, \u201cI\u2019m just jumping around and watching my favorite ones.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat works,\u201d Dan nodded, he blushed slightly and casually swung his legs so they rested on Phil\u2019s lap. He knew exactly what Dan was hinting at but he pretended not to notice the hopeful feet wriggling on his lap. He almost laughed when he saw Dan pout but he kept his oblivious facade. </p><p>Dan sighed and took his legs off of Phil\u2019s lap. <i>He\u2019s probably not in the mood,</i> he sadly thought and got up to go back to his room for more studying. Phil watched him leave in shock and quickly stood up and went after Dan. </p><p>\u201cHey Dan,\u201d he grabbed his arm before he left the room. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for bothering you, I\u2019m probably going to study for the rest of the day,\u201d he mumbled, trying to shake off Phil\u2019s grip. </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go back to study like that,\u201d Phil suddenly grabbed both of Dan\u2019s wrists and scribbled his fingers wildly on his belly. Dan erupted with a loud squeal and he crumbled to the floor, Phil laughed and straddled his best friend\u2019s waist, continuing to torture his poor belly and sides. His boisterous laugher filled the flat as Phil kneaded into his hips and gently pinched his belly. A giant grin was stretched across his bright red face and Phil knew he should give him a break in a few seconds. As a last hurrah, Phil reached down to squeeze his thighs and craned his head to blow loud raspberries in Dan\u2019s neck. The noise that came out of Dan\u2019s mouth was more of a scream than laughter, he felt like he was going to go insane after each raspberry sent ticklish waves down his body. Phil laughed and mercifully stopped the attack, Dan curled up into a giggling mess with a happiest smile on his face. </p><p>\u201cSkip studying for the day and binge watch Free with me?\u201d Phil got up from the floor and helped Dan shakily stand to his feet. He thought it was adorable how his friend\u2019s cheeks were still flushed and he looked relaxed for the first time in a while. </p><p>\u201cCan we order pizza?\u201d He asked in a childish tone. </p><p>\u201cIf you go down to grab it when it comes,\u201d Phil replied cheekily. Dan looked down at his crumbled sweatpants and his black oversized sweater with toothpaste stains and questionable hairs stuck on the fabric. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dressed like a freaking hermit!\u201d He complained. Phil poked at Dan\u2019s belly and he jumped back with a yelp. </p><p>\u201cDo I need to help convince you?\u201d Phil had a mischievous grin on his face. Dan\u2019s eyes grew wide and protected his belly with his arms. </p><p>\u201cFine I\u2019ll do it!\u201d He stammered, quickly walking to the living room and plopping down on the couch, \u201cBut you\u2019re paying.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d Phil laughed and followed Dan, he grabbed the remote and turned on the television. As Dan placed their usual pizza order online, the intro song to Free blasted through the speakers. Phil snuck a glance at Dan and was relieved to see a genuinely content smile on his face. For the last few weeks Dan had holed himself in his room to study and when he did come out, the usual sarcastic and goofy man was replaced with a depressed and quiet stranger. Phil was starting to get worried and spent late nights looking up therapists and desperately tried to find ways to help his best friend. He wished this moment would never end but he was glad that a couple wiggling fingers brought back Dan\u2019s radiant smile even if it was just for a couple hours. </p>",

He almost laughed when he saw Dan pout but he kept his oblivious facade. </p><p>Dan sighed and took his legs off of Phil\u2019s lap. <i>He\u2019s probably not in the mood,</i> he sadly thought and got up to go back to his room for more studying. Phil watched him leave in shock and quickly stood up and went after Dan. </p><p>\u201cHey Dan,\u201d he grabbed his arm before he left the room. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for bothering you, I\u2019m probably going to study for the rest of the day,\u201d he mumbled, trying to shake off Phil\u2019s grip. </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go back to study like that,\u201d Phil suddenly grabbed both of Dan\u2019s wrists and scribbled his fingers wildly on his belly. Dan erupted with a loud squeal and he crumbled to the floor, Phil laughed and straddled his best friend\u2019s waist, continuing to torture his poor belly and sides. His boisterous laugher filled the flat as Phil kneaded into his hips and gently pinched his belly. A giant grin was stretched across his bright red face and Phil knew he should give him a break in a few seconds. As a last hurrah, Phil reached down to squeeze his thighs and craned his head to blow loud raspberries in Dan\u2019s neck. The noise that came out of Dan\u2019s mouth was more of a scream than laughter, he felt like he was going to go insane after each raspberry sent ticklish waves down his body. Phil laughed and mercifully stopped the attack, Dan curled up into a giggling mess with a happiest smile on his face. </p><p>\u201cSkip studying for the day and binge watch Free with me?\u201d Phil got up from the floor and helped Dan shakily stand to his feet. He thought it was adorable how his friend\u2019s cheeks were still flushed and he looked relaxed for the first time in a while. </p><p>\u201cCan we order pizza?\u201d He asked in a childish tone. </p><p>\u201cIf you go down to grab it when it comes,\u201d Phil replied cheekily. Dan looked down at his crumbled sweatpants and his black oversized sweater with toothpaste stains and questionable hairs stuck on the fabric. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dressed like a freaking hermit!\u201d He complained. Phil poked at Dan\u2019s belly and he jumped back with a yelp. </p><p>\u201cDo I need to help convince you?\u201d Phil had a mischievous grin on his face. Dan\u2019s eyes grew wide and protected his belly with his arms. </p><p>\u201cFine I\u2019ll do it!\u201d He stammered, quickly walking to the living room and plopping down on the couch, \u201cBut you\u2019re paying.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d Phil laughed and followed Dan, he grabbed the remote and turned on the television. As Dan placed their usual pizza order online, the intro song to Free blasted through the speakers. Phil snuck a glance at Dan and was relieved to see a genuinely content smile on his face. For the last few weeks Dan had holed himself in his room to study and when he did come out, the usual sarcastic and goofy man was replaced with a depressed and quiet stranger. Phil was starting to get worried and spent late nights looking up therapists and desperately tried to find ways to help his best friend. He wished this moment would never end but he was glad that a couple wiggling fingers brought back Dan\u2019s radiant smile even if it was just for a couple hours. </p>",
                "content": "<p>Aw thank you! I&rsquo;m sorry you had a bad brain night, I know exactly how that feels. I assumed that you meant Dan and Phil for this fic, hopefully you like it!!&nbsp;</p><p>______________________________________</p><p>Dan and Phil knew each other inside and out, most of the time they didn&rsquo;t even need to talk, they just made eye contact and instantly knew what the latter was thinking.</p><p>Rather early into their friendship, they realized that they could get quite needy when it came to physical affection. It wasn&rsquo;t out of romance, more from the fact that they trusted each other and everyone needed a hug every once in a while. They started out with sitting closer to each other on the couch, giving each other pokes in the side and gently bumping into one another, and now their new thing was playful tickle fights. </p><p>Phil was more direct with his wants and stretched his feet out on Dan&rsquo;s lap for a couple scribbles on the soles of his feet. Dan was shyer when he craved attention and acted like a brat or tried to start a tickle fight by poking his best friend in the belly. Phil thought it was absolutely adorable and sometimes when he felt mean, he pretended not to notice Dan&rsquo;s subtle hints to make him squirm with anticipation. </p><p>Dan felt like his brain was going to explode. He was drowning in homework and exams were coming up, he really struggled with making friends in uni and felt like he was absolutely alone. Phil was a great person to talk to, but he was already done with school and didn&rsquo;t really remember the stress and pressure of doing well in class. Dan was rapidly losing interest in studying law and that didn&rsquo;t help with his motivation, his friends all suggested to change his course of study but he knew deep down inside he didn&rsquo;t want to go to uni anymore, and he was absolutely terrified of being considered a failure. </p><p>The young YouTuber stared at the piles of homework strewn all over his bedroom floor. All the information he was trying to cram into his head was becoming a jumbled up mess and the more he tried to study, the more he felt anxious and overwhelmed. He knew he needed to take a break now or else he was going to crumble into a depressed mess on the ground. </p><p><i>Wonder what Phil&rsquo;s doing, </i>he wondered, getting up and leaving his room for the first time in hours. He heard the faint sounds of an anime coming from the living room, upon entering the room he saw his best friend Phil watching some old episodes of Haikyuu. </p><p>&ldquo;What episode is this?&rdquo; Dan plopped on the couch next to him and helped himself to a handful of crisps. </p><p>&ldquo;First one of season 3,&rdquo; he took a big swig of his tea, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just jumping around and watching my favorite ones.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That works,&rdquo; Dan nodded, he blushed slightly and casually swung his legs so they rested on Phil&rsquo;s lap.
