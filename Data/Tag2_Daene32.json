She didn\u2019t get to confront the Targaryen legacy, <i>she succumbed to it</i>. When she talks to Jon in the dragonpit at the end of season 7, her dialogue is specifically about this! She loves her heritage but she knows her family has made grievous mistakes. That she comments on the poor treatment of the dragons says enough. They are HER children. That they allowed them to crumble\u2026to fall\u2026to misuse and devalue them, her children, she sees as horrible. But this is also how she feels of anyone subjected to subjection. How could you turn her. How could you deny her such a beautiful story. So that the Starks can all find their way home in the end, enact every revenge they have piled up, only to split up.

She loves her heritage but she knows her family has made grievous mistakes. That she comments on the poor treatment of the dragons says enough. They are HER children. That they allowed them to crumble\u2026to fall\u2026to misuse and devalue them, her children, she sees as horrible. But this is also how she feels of anyone subjected to subjection. How could you turn her. How could you deny her such a beautiful story. So that the Starks can all find their way home in the end, enact every revenge they have piled up, only to split up.

        "answer": "<p>I\u2019m sort of in the yes-and-no boat on that front. Tyrion is definitely heading down a darker path throughout <i>ADWD</i>, drinking heavily and dealing with the trauma (yes, trauma) of having murdered his father and Shae, as well as having been betrayed by Jaime, one of the few people he trusted.

In the dream he had two heads, both noseless. His father led the enemy, so he slew him once again.

It\u2019s not who he is, but rather what he\u2019s struggling with, as he\u2019s consistently struggled with it over the series.

And if it tastes of gold and lion&rsquo;s blood, so much the better. <b>As I cannot be the hero, let me be the monster, and lesson them in fear in place of love.&rdquo;</b> (Mercy, <i>TWOW</i>)</p></blockquote><p>This is where Tyrion is at. It&rsquo;s not who he is, but rather what he&rsquo;s struggling with, as he&rsquo;s consistently struggled with it over the series. It&rsquo;s an effect of his vaguely anti-hero role, battling the selfish urges in himself to do what&rsquo;s right; he succeeds in many cases, such as in <i>AGOT</i>, saving Catelyn&rsquo;s life despite thinking he shouldn&rsquo;t care. But later, those darker urges start to win out, and I&rsquo;m afraid that one of those darker urges will manifest in encouraging Daenerys to bring fire and blood to King&rsquo;s Landing.</p><p>If I could step into the realm of less founded speculation, though, I would say that Dany herself will likely play a big part in Tyrion&rsquo;s healing. At the end of <i>ADWD</i> and the beginning of <i>TWOW</i>, we know his interest in Daenerys is as a weapon, a way to destroy his family and get back at the people who scorned him (even after he saved them during the Battle of the Blackwater). Going forward, however, and keeping in mind the two&rsquo;s personalities and parallels, it feels plausible to me that Tyrion, against his newfound habit of hatred, might actually come to admire her as a person.</p><p>Which would make her accidental igniting of the wildfire beneath King&rsquo;s Landing hit him a lot harder.</p><p>This won&rsquo;t erase Daenerys&rsquo; culpability in the destruction by any means (people will always have a level of responsibility for their own actions; this doesn&rsquo;t make them irredeemable), but I do think it serves a purpose: this would be the low point for Daenerys <i>and</i> Tyrion, and afterwards they&rsquo;ll have to decide whether or not they&rsquo;ll embrace it.</p>",

        "body": "<p>The ironborn ship had finally reached the mysterious city of Asshai and anchored on a deserted dock, where dozens of crates of abandoned merchandise and some abandoned fishing nets were dragging. Having dressed in her ebony dress and black cloak, Daenerys, accompanied by Kinvara and two soldiers from the Fiery Hand, descended from the footbridge and stepped on the crackling wood of the dock. Finally, on the mainland, she said to herself breathing a great blow, after almost a whole month at sea. Yara then went down, also escorted by two ironborn warriors, and also accompanied by Shen-zoan who volunteered to accompany them. Grey Worm and the remaining of the crew were appointed to guard the ship during the group&rsquo;s absence, who would come back for them tomorrow morning for the start of the inland expedition. Indeed, being too late to leave, Daenerys had decided that they would spend the night in Asshai. The young queen was still too tired to take a long walk, and had to sleep a little. Kinvara made no objection, and guiding Daenerys, offered to show her a safe place she apparently knew and where they could spend the night.<br/>Far too big to be able to follow his mother in the streets of Asshai, Drogon was forced to stay on the docks, bigger. The dragon gave a worried, almost childish growl when Daenerys came to him, caressing his muzzle with love and kissing him on the nose. She saw that Drogon was concerned, that he did not like at all the heavy and macabre atmosphere of this city.<br/>_ &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back tomorrow, my sweet boy, don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;m in good hands.&rdquo; she said with all the affection she could have for her last son. Drogon moaned again, seeing her leave with the others, but had to resign himself to obey. Drogon looked around him, growling suspiciously against the shadows he thought he saw moving in the recesses of some dark alleyways. Shen-zoan, while walking, came alongside Daenerys.<br/>_ &ldquo;Your relationship with this dragon is very surprising, my queen.&rdquo; he commented without passing this for a reproach, quite the contrary.<br/>_&ldquo;Drogon is more than a friend, dear Shen &hellip;&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;he is my son, born from the fire, just like me.&rdquo;<br/>The traveler was interested in the story, and looked for something in his bag. Something he found and handed to the dragon queen, as a gift. A parchment, on which was drawn in black ink, a very detailed and beautiful portrait of Drogon, in a posture of majestic flight. Daenerys was impressed by the sense of detail and the elegance of the drawing, as if it were almost moving in front of her eyes.<br/>_ &ldquo;It&rsquo;s &hellip;. it&rsquo;s beautiful.&rdquo; she said, thanking her new friend for this gift, compliment he received with a humble bow.<br/>_ &ldquo;The beauty and majesty of certain things are such that they deserve to be immortalized forever &hellip; Who knows &hellip;.. would you ever want me to make a portrait of you, one day, majesty?&rdquo; he asked very modestly. Daenerys smiled, a little embarrassed, and blushed slightly after what seemed like a compliment to Drogon but also to her, keeping the drawing close to her. Shen suddenly looked a little embarrassed too, seeing her blush.<br/>_&ldquo;Forgive me if my remark causes you embarrassment, my queen, I assure you that my attention was not &hellip;&rdquo; he apologized, but was interrupted by the thin hand of Daenerys coming gently take his.<br/>_ &ldquo;I would be honored &hellip;.. thank you, my friend.&rdquo; was the answer of the young woman, to the great pleasure of Shen who was reassured.<br/>The queen and her escort left the wharves to finally enter the first street of Asshai, between two large black houses with closed shutters. Draped from her red coat with the hood on her head, Kinvara walked in the lead. Behind her, Daenerys, escorted on either side by the two warriors of the Fiery Hand. Behind, closing the march, Yara Greyjoy, her two ironborn guards and Shen-zoan. While walking, Daenerys could finally contemplate with her eyes the city of shadows.<br/>The immensity of this city was disconcerting. It was much larger than King&rsquo;s Landing. But despite its size, it seemed almost abandoned, few houses being lit, and the light of the few torches seemed to be absorbed in the darkness of the night. All the buildings were built with black stone, with a disturbing and greasy appearance. The mist had invaded the streets and alleys and snaked on the ground, forming a disturbing carpet of smoke. The architecture of the city was very strange. Palaces built next to brothels and other shabby establishments, and also many temples and other places of worship more or less frequented. According to legend, in Asshai, all religions and cults are allowed, such as the obscure and poorly known cults of the Black Goat and the Lion of Night, or a religion better known as that of the god R'hllor. All kinds of entities were venerated here, such as the moonsingers, the necromancers, the pyromancers, the bloodmages, or the most dreaded of all, the shadowbinders, who were said to be capable of giving birth to demons made up of shadows during very special rituals.<br/>The group met a few people, all of whom were hiding under the porches of the houses or in the recesses of the aisles, waiting in silence and watching the group go by without saying a word. Daenerys could see that the inhabitants were all very dressed, hiding the smallest part of their bodies, and were all veiled, wearing masks or hoods. Daenerys could almost feel their eyes on her, and did everything to try to ignore them and kept going, although they did nothing to try to harm her. It was almost as if they were waiting for her coming. Was that the case?<br/>Daenerys&rsquo; group passed by the entrance of what looked like a temple. Daenerys take a fast look as she passed, she saw, with horror, a crowd of worshipers, chanting incomprehensible words and venerating an idol in the shape of a humanoid goat. One of the worshipers, the leader of the ritual, had covered himself from head to foot with blood, and seemed to be in a trance, convulsing while waving his arms. Yara swallowed when she saw that, just like Shen, and both continued without stopping. Everywhere, they seemed to hear like ritual songs and other incantations coming from the interior of the houses, all in languages \u200b\u200bas varied as strange. What could be happening in this city?<br/>_ &ldquo;What is this city of demons?&rdquo; Yara sighed, notch, just like her two guards. Shen remained calm, but showed his distrust of what was happening here. Kinvara remained calm as usual, and stopped in front of a building in the center of a small deserted square. The sticky sign hanging over the entrance seemed to indicate a bazaar.<br/>_&ldquo;Here we are.&rdquo; said Kinvara, who without hesitation, pushed the door to enter the first, and inviting the others to follow her inside, which they did, after a few seconds of hesitation.<br/>A smell of spices, but also a mixture of incense and other medicinal products came to rub their nostrils as soon as they entered. The place was of average size, but full of objects of all kinds. Small dead animals hung on the ceiling. Pots containing various medicinal products or for any other purpose. Many objects made of bone, wood and other natural elements apparently used for ritual purposes, and even sinister dolls. A little monkey, with red eyes, walked freely between the shelves, emitting curious little sounds against the visitors.<br/>Kinvara led the rest of the group to the bottom of the bazaar, where behind a counter, was a person bent to examine the inside of a dead black rat&rsquo;s corpse and extract its vital organs. The woman behind the counter looked up, and smiled at Kinvara, seeming to know her.<br/>_&ldquo;My dear Lady Kinvara &hellip;. finally we meet again after such a long time &hellip;&rdquo; said the woman from the bazaar in a honeyed and deep voice with an almost seductive tone. She had pale skin, but looked as if she was wearing makeup all over her body and was tattooed on almost the entire face. Long dreadlocks fell on her shoulders, and she was dressed in a strange dress made of animal leather and wore around her neck a pendant made of skulls of sparrows. Her smiling gray lips revealed behind a teething as white as her face. Kinvara greeted her with a nod.<br/>_&ldquo;I greet you, Heliora. I bring you some visitors to spend the night, and they will leave tomorrow morning with me.&rdquo;<br/>The strange young woman named Heliora listened, then her gaze was drawn behind Kinvara&rsquo;s shoulder towards Daenerys, who was looking around with an edge of suspicion. Heliora&rsquo;s face seemed to clear, as if she had seen a messiah appear before her.<br/>_&ldquo;You &hellip;&rdquo; she whispered between her lips as she walked towards Daenerys, who remained frozen in front of the woman staring at her. Yara wanted to intervene, but Shen held her back, making her understand by the look that it was better not to interfere with the people of Asshai. Heliora, with her blackened-fingered hands, felt a little the face of the young dragon queen, examining her from head to foot. Kinvara let her do, knowing her merchant friend well.<br/>_ &ldquo;You, so young, but already having suffered so many trials, beyond the very veil of life and death &hellip;. You, who have long been lost in a quest doomed to failure, but destined for something so much bigger &hellip;.. Daenerys of house Targaryen.&rdquo;<br/>Heliora spoke very slowly, mystically, every word seemed to materialize out of her mouth. Daenerys could almost feel her blood-red-iris eyes piercing her mind, as if reading inside her.<br/>_ &ldquo;Y &hellip;. do you know me?&rdquo; Daenerys said a little confused. Heliora smiled at her, with the same seductive air as towards Kinvara. Obviously, she preferred women to men. She also glanced at Yara, whose young ironborn queen did not seem to be indifferent and smiled her back.<br/>_ &ldquo;The reputation of the breaker of chains and mother of dragons has reached the ears of Asshai. Everyone here knows who you are, even those who have no ears to hear or eyes to see.&rdquo; confirmed Heliora returning to Daenerys. Heliora, whoever or whatever she was, gave her goose bumps.<br/>_&ldquo;Your friends can stay for the night, Kinvara, but you know you have to pay.&rdquo; Heliora announced, returning to her counter, while giving a small caress to her monkey who come join her.<br/>_&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Kinvara kindly replied, telling one of her Fiery Hand soldiers to come forward, to give her something wrapped in a rag, which she put under the merchant&rsquo;s eyes. The latter removed the rag, revealing a special dagger. Daenerys gasped as she sees the weapon. It was the dagger with which Jon had killed her. Kinvara had kept it after extracting it. Daenerys felt bad and had to turn away from the sight of the weapon, backed by Yara and Shen. Heliora could not contain her joy at possessing this dagger now, the very one whose blade had been impregnated with the blood of the dragon.<br/>_ &ldquo;Your payment is honest, my dear Kinvara.&rdquo; Heliora told her, confiding the object to his monkey, who went to hide it somewhere in the shop, out of sight. &ldquo;You are welcome in my humble abode, my good lords &hellip;.. tonight you can sleep &hellip;. But beware, young dragon queen, because at every moment the night is dark and full of terrors.&rdquo; warned the merchant in a silly little sneer. Uncomfortable, Daenerys chosen to move and guided by Kinvara, goes to the room where she can sleep, while Heliora focuses again on her dead rat on the counter, tearing the heart with forceps.<br/>********<br/>A little later in the night, Daenerys, despite the gloomy atmosphere of this bazaar, had managed to fall asleep in a room at the back of the shop. The two soldiers of the Fiery Hand, by order of the priestess, would remain all night as sentinels in front of the door of the room. The two ironborn sailors had gone to sleep in the bazaar reserve too. Kinvara, who was not sleepy, had settled into a kind of living room, and was patient, sitting watching the flames dancing gently in the hearth. She was not alone because Shen was there too, sitting with his eyes closed, meditating. Also unable to sleep, Yara had gone outside, under the porch of the shop. Her water bottle in hand, the ironborn queen was nervous and alert, listening to each sound that was heard in the surrounding streets and looking constantly looking for any suspicious movement. The mist, however, did not help to see the area around the store.<br/>_ &ldquo;Nervous?&rdquo; suddenly said Heliora, who like a ghost, had arrived behind Yara, who jumped in surprise and sighed with annoyance.<br/>_&ldquo;You should be careful, I could have put my ax in your head without wanting it.&rdquo; Yara warns, taking a sip. Undaunted, Heliora continues to smile and comes closer slowly but surely to Yara, who noticed it well.<br/>_&ldquo;Oh, but I don&rsquo;t doubt it, a proud warrior like you,&rdquo; commented Heliora, her eye sparkling with a certain lust. Yara guessed it, and she liked it. Their faces are closer to each other.<br/>_ &ldquo;You know &hellip;.&rdquo; Yara sighed as she came to touch one of the dreadlocks with her fingers and pushed it away from the merchant&rsquo;s handsome face &ldquo;&hellip; you&rsquo;re the most weird and crooked woman I&rsquo;ve ever met in my fucking life, but I like this.&rdquo;<br/>Heliora did not wait anymore, coming to snuggle against Yara&rsquo;s chest, blocking her against the wall, their mouths meeting in a kiss more and more sensual. Without interrupting the kiss, Heliora rubbed her hand along Yara&rsquo;s body, then her thigh to finally come and touch the crotch, which made Yara smile naughty.<br/>_ &ldquo;You&rsquo;re interested by what&rsquo;s in store from what I see, it&rsquo;s good, we&rsquo;re open all night.&rdquo; Yara quipped, eager to go further, as did Heliora. Having never done this with a woman in armor, it excited her even more. Both decided to go back inside, Heliora knowing a room where they would be quiet to continue without risking to wake the others.<br/>Meanwhile, in the room at the back of the shop dipped in the dark, Daenerys was lying in a single bed, but nevertheless clean and comfortable to sleep peacefully. However, the queen, asleep, did not notice the furtive figure silently approaching the window of the room, looking out onto a deserted, misty street. The form, dressed entirely in black and wearing a hood, glanced quickly through the window, catching sight of the sleeping young queen in the middle of the room.<br/>Still in the greatest discretion, the masked individual began to cut the glass pane with a blade, managing to make a hole in the glass large enough to pass a hand. However, he did not try to open the window from inside, but passed something through the hole. A manticore, a deadly venom insect from Essos. The deadly insect began to crawl toward Daenerys&rsquo; bed, and slowly began to climb the sheet to hoist itself to the top of the bed and come up to the young woman, who does not suspect anything.<br/>From the wharves, Drogon, who was sleeping, suddenly opened his eyes, filled with a sense of danger and fear for his mother. In the living room of the shop, Shen-zoan abruptly came out of his meditation with the same strange feeling and turned to Kinvara.<br/>_&ldquo;Yes &hellip; I saw it too &hellip;&rdquo; she confirmed. Without further ado, Shen grabbed his wooden stick, jumped up and as fast as he could, ran to the room where the queen was sleeping. Alerted by the commotion, Yara and Heliora, who did not have time to start their night together, came to see what was happening and saw Shen pass in front of them like an arrow.<br/>The manticore had crawled and was now standing very close to Daenerys&rsquo;s face, getting ready to sting her neck with his hooked dart filled with a more than poisonous poison. The door to the room suddenly opened and Shen burst into the room, and without further ado, with a nimble stick blow and without touching Daenerys, pushed away the poisonous insect that crashed against the wall. Daenerys straightened up, panting and awakened by the noise, to see Shen armed with his staff and looked around the room vigilantly, while Kinvara and the Fiery Hand soldiers came in their turn. Kinvara sat down beside Daenerys on the bed.<br/>_ &ldquo;My queen, are you all right?&rdquo; asked the priestess.<br/>_&ldquo;I &hellip; yes, I believe, but what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; asked Daenerys, more than confused. Shen looked everywhere, and that&rsquo;s where he saw him. The dark silhouette behind the window, which was starting to flee. Without saying a word and under the dumbfounded gaze of Daenerys, Shen rushed and jumped quickly and agilely through the glass of the window, breaking it into pieces and landing on his feet in the street, in defensive posture. Without further ado, he set off in pursuit of the man dressed in black who was running away with extraordinary speed.<br/>Yara and Heliora arrived in the room, noticing the facts and the broken window. Yara came to make sure, asking Daenerys if she was okay. Kinvara leaned forward and gently picked up the crushed corpse of the poisonous insect to reveal it in plain sight. Daenerys felt her heart beat.<br/>_ &ldquo;A manticore &hellip;&rdquo; she says. She had already seen one of these insects, which had also wanted to sting her once. A trap set by the warlocks of Qarth. Were they them again? Did they come to take revenge? Perhaps.<br/>A few minutes later, while everyone gathered in the living room with Daenerys, still under the shock of this assassination attempt and supported by Yara sitting next to her. Shen ends up coming back to the shop, empty-handed.<br/>_ &ldquo;He was going too fast.&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I could not catch him and he seemed to know the streets of this city like his pocket, but he dropped that.&rdquo;<br/>Shen threw a small object, a sort of small piece of iron that Kinvara caught in the palm of her hand and examined closely. Her worst doubts seemed to come true. A very special coin, from Braavos.<br/>_ &ldquo;Whom does it come from?&rdquo; Yara asked. Kinvara looked at them one by one, hinting at the worst of all.<br/>_ &ldquo;The Faceless Men.&rdquo; confirmed the priestess. Daenerys was only more shocked. Like many, she knew the terrifying reputation of those assassins and their mysterious powers. For Shen, it also confirmed something more disturbing than he shared with others.<br/>_ &ldquo;The Faceless Men never act alone. Someone wants you dead, my queen.&rdquo;<br/></p>",

            "comment": "<p>The ironborn ship had finally reached the mysterious city of Asshai and anchored on a deserted dock, where dozens of crates of abandoned merchandise and some abandoned fishing nets were dragging. Having dressed in her ebony dress and black cloak, Daenerys, accompanied by Kinvara and two soldiers from the Fiery Hand, descended from the footbridge and stepped on the crackling wood of the dock. Finally, on the mainland, she said to herself breathing a great blow, after almost a whole month at sea. Yara then went down, also escorted by two ironborn warriors, and also accompanied by Shen-zoan who volunteered to accompany them. Grey Worm and the remaining of the crew were appointed to guard the ship during the group\u2019s absence, who would come back for them tomorrow morning for the start of the inland expedition. Indeed, being too late to leave, Daenerys had decided that they would spend the night in Asshai. The young queen was still too tired to take a long walk, and had to sleep a little. Kinvara made no objection, and guiding Daenerys, offered to show her a safe place she apparently knew and where they could spend the night.<br>Far too big to be able to follow his mother in the streets of Asshai, Drogon was forced to stay on the docks, bigger. The dragon gave a worried, almost childish growl when Daenerys came to him, caressing his muzzle with love and kissing him on the nose. She saw that Drogon was concerned, that he did not like at all the heavy and macabre atmosphere of this city.<br>_ \u201cI\u2019ll be back tomorrow, my sweet boy, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m in good hands.\u201d she said with all the affection she could have for her last son. Drogon moaned again, seeing her leave with the others, but had to resign himself to obey. Drogon looked around him, growling suspiciously against the shadows he thought he saw moving in the recesses of some dark alleyways. Shen-zoan, while walking, came alongside Daenerys.<br>_ \u201cYour relationship with this dragon is very surprising, my queen.\u201d he commented without passing this for a reproach, quite the contrary.<br>_\u201cDrogon is more than a friend, dear Shen \u2026\u201d she replied, \u201che is my son, born from the fire, just like me.\u201d<br>The traveler was interested in the story, and looked for something in his bag. Something he found and handed to the dragon queen, as a gift. A parchment, on which was drawn in black ink, a very detailed and beautiful portrait of Drogon, in a posture of majestic flight. Daenerys was impressed by the sense of detail and the elegance of the drawing, as if it were almost moving in front of her eyes.<br>_ \u201cIt\u2019s \u2026. it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d she said, thanking her new friend for this gift, compliment he received with a humble bow.<br>_ \u201cThe beauty and majesty of certain things are such that they deserve to be immortalized forever \u2026 Who knows \u2026.. would you ever want me to make a portrait of you, one day, majesty?\u201d he asked very modestly. Daenerys smiled, a little embarrassed, and blushed slightly after what seemed like a compliment to Drogon but also to her, keeping the drawing close to her. Shen suddenly looked a little embarrassed too, seeing her blush.<br>_\u201cForgive me if my remark causes you embarrassment, my queen, I assure you that my attention was not \u2026\u201d he apologized, but was interrupted by the thin hand of Daenerys coming gently take his.<br>_ \u201cI would be honored \u2026.. thank you, my friend.\u201d was the answer of the young woman, to the great pleasure of Shen who was reassured.<br>The queen and her escort left the wharves to finally enter the first street of Asshai, between two large black houses with closed shutters. Draped from her red coat with the hood on her head, Kinvara walked in the lead. Behind her, Daenerys, escorted on either side by the two warriors of the Fiery Hand. Behind, closing the march, Yara Greyjoy, her two ironborn guards and Shen-zoan. While walking, Daenerys could finally contemplate with her eyes the city of shadows.<br>The immensity of this city was disconcerting. It was much larger than King\u2019s Landing. But despite its size, it seemed almost abandoned, few houses being lit, and the light of the few torches seemed to be absorbed in the darkness of the night. All the buildings were built with black stone, with a disturbing and greasy appearance. The mist had invaded the streets and alleys and snaked on the ground, forming a disturbing carpet of smoke. The architecture of the city was very strange. Palaces built next to brothels and other shabby establishments, and also many temples and other places of worship more or less frequented. According to legend, in Asshai, all religions and cults are allowed, such as the obscure and poorly known cults of the Black Goat and the Lion of Night, or a religion better known as that of the god R'hllor. All kinds of entities were venerated here, such as the moonsingers, the necromancers, the pyromancers, the bloodmages, or the most dreaded of all, the shadowbinders, who were said to be capable of giving birth to demons made up of shadows during very special rituals.<br>The group met a few people, all of whom were hiding under the porches of the houses or in the recesses of the aisles, waiting in silence and watching the group go by without saying a word. Daenerys could see that the inhabitants were all very dressed, hiding the smallest part of their bodies, and were all veiled, wearing masks or hoods. Daenerys could almost feel their eyes on her, and did everything to try to ignore them and kept going, although they did nothing to try to harm her. It was almost as if they were waiting for her coming. Was that the case?<br>Daenerys\u2019 group passed by the entrance of what looked like a temple. Daenerys take a fast look as she passed, she saw, with horror, a crowd of worshipers, chanting incomprehensible words and venerating an idol in the shape of a humanoid goat. One of the worshipers, the leader of the ritual, had covered himself from head to foot with blood, and seemed to be in a trance, convulsing while waving his arms. Yara swallowed when she saw that, just like Shen, and both continued without stopping. Everywhere, they seemed to hear like ritual songs and other incantations coming from the interior of the houses, all in languages \u200b\u200bas varied as strange. What could be happening in this city?<br>_ \u201cWhat is this city of demons?\u201d Yara sighed, notch, just like her two guards. Shen remained calm, but showed his distrust of what was happening here. Kinvara remained calm as usual, and stopped in front of a building in the center of a small deserted square. The sticky sign hanging over the entrance seemed to indicate a bazaar.<br>_\u201cHere we are.\u201d said Kinvara, who without hesitation, pushed the door to enter the first, and inviting the others to follow her inside, which they did, after a few seconds of hesitation.<br>A smell of spices, but also a mixture of incense and other medicinal products came to rub their nostrils as soon as they entered. The place was of average size, but full of objects of all kinds. Small dead animals hung on the ceiling. Pots containing various medicinal products or for any other purpose. Many objects made of bone, wood and other natural elements apparently used for ritual purposes, and even sinister dolls. A little monkey, with red eyes, walked freely between the shelves, emitting curious little sounds against the visitors.<br>Kinvara led the rest of the group to the bottom of the bazaar, where behind a counter, was a person bent to examine the inside of a dead black rat\u2019s corpse and extract its vital organs. The woman behind the counter looked up, and smiled at Kinvara, seeming to know her.<br>_\u201cMy dear Lady Kinvara \u2026. finally we meet again after such a long time \u2026\u201d said the woman from the bazaar in a honeyed and deep voice with an almost seductive tone. She had pale skin, but looked as if she was wearing makeup all over her body and was tattooed on almost the entire face. Long dreadlocks fell on her shoulders, and she was dressed in a strange dress made of animal leather and wore around her neck a pendant made of skulls of sparrows. Her smiling gray lips revealed behind a teething as white as her face. Kinvara greeted her with a nod.<br>_\u201cI greet you, Heliora. I bring you some visitors to spend the night, and they will leave tomorrow morning with me.\u201d<br>The strange young woman named Heliora listened, then her gaze was drawn behind Kinvara\u2019s shoulder towards Daenerys, who was looking around with an edge of suspicion. Heliora\u2019s face seemed to clear, as if she had seen a messiah appear before her.<br>_\u201cYou \u2026\u201d she whispered between her lips as she walked towards Daenerys, who remained frozen in front of the woman staring at her. Yara wanted to intervene, but Shen held her back, making her understand by the look that it was better not to interfere with the people of Asshai. Heliora, with her blackened-fingered hands, felt a little the face of the young dragon queen, examining her from head to foot. Kinvara let her do, knowing her merchant friend well.<br>_ \u201cYou, so young, but already having suffered so many trials, beyond the very veil of life and death \u2026. You, who have long been lost in a quest doomed to failure, but destined for something so much bigger \u2026.. Daenerys of house Targaryen.\u201d<br>Heliora spoke very slowly, mystically, every word seemed to materialize out of her mouth. Daenerys could almost feel her blood-red-iris eyes piercing her mind, as if reading inside her.<br>_ \u201cY \u2026. do you know me?\u201d Daenerys said a little confused. Heliora smiled at her, with the same seductive air as towards Kinvara. Obviously, she preferred women to men. She also glanced at Yara, whose young ironborn queen did not seem to be indifferent and smiled her back.<br>_ \u201cThe reputation of the breaker of chains and mother of dragons has reached the ears of Asshai. Everyone here knows who you are, even those who have no ears to hear or eyes to see.\u201d confirmed Heliora returning to Daenerys. Heliora, whoever or whatever she was, gave her goose bumps.<br>_\u201cYour friends can stay for the night, Kinvara, but you know you have to pay.\u201d Heliora announced, returning to her counter, while giving a small caress to her monkey who come join her.<br>_\u201cOf course.\u201d Kinvara kindly replied, telling one of her Fiery Hand soldiers to come forward, to give her something wrapped in a rag, which she put under the merchant\u2019s eyes. The latter removed the rag, revealing a special dagger. Daenerys gasped as she sees the weapon. It was the dagger with which Jon had killed her. Kinvara had kept it after extracting it. Daenerys felt bad and had to turn away from the sight of the weapon, backed by Yara and Shen. Heliora could not contain her joy at possessing this dagger now, the very one whose blade had been impregnated with the blood of the dragon.<br>_ \u201cYour payment is honest, my dear Kinvara.\u201d Heliora told her, confiding the object to his monkey, who went to hide it somewhere in the shop, out of sight. \u201cYou are welcome in my humble abode, my good lords \u2026.. tonight you can sleep \u2026. But beware, young dragon queen, because at every moment the night is dark and full of terrors.\u201d warned the merchant in a silly little sneer. Uncomfortable, Daenerys chosen to move and guided by Kinvara, goes to the room where she can sleep, while Heliora focuses again on her dead rat on the counter, tearing the heart with forceps.<br>********<br>A little later in the night, Daenerys, despite the gloomy atmosphere of this bazaar, had managed to fall asleep in a room at the back of the shop. The two soldiers of the Fiery Hand, by order of the priestess, would remain all night as sentinels in front of the door of the room. The two ironborn sailors had gone to sleep in the bazaar reserve too. Kinvara, who was not sleepy, had settled into a kind of living room, and was patient, sitting watching the flames dancing gently in the hearth. She was not alone because Shen was there too, sitting with his eyes closed, meditating. Also unable to sleep, Yara had gone outside, under the porch of the shop. Her water bottle in hand, the ironborn queen was nervous and alert, listening to each sound that was heard in the surrounding streets and looking constantly looking for any suspicious movement. The mist, however, did not help to see the area around the store.<br>_ \u201cNervous?\u201d suddenly said Heliora, who like a ghost, had arrived behind Yara, who jumped in surprise and sighed with annoyance.<br>_\u201cYou should be careful, I could have put my ax in your head without wanting it.\u201d Yara warns, taking a sip. Undaunted, Heliora continues to smile and comes closer slowly but surely to Yara, who noticed it well.<br>_\u201cOh, but I don\u2019t doubt it, a proud warrior like you,\u201d commented Heliora, her eye sparkling with a certain lust. Yara guessed it, and she liked it. Their faces are closer to each other.<br>_ \u201cYou know \u2026.\u201d Yara sighed as she came to touch one of the dreadlocks with her fingers and pushed it away from the merchant\u2019s handsome face \u201c\u2026 you\u2019re the most weird and crooked woman I\u2019ve ever met in my fucking life, but I like this.\u201d<br>Heliora did not wait anymore, coming to snuggle against Yara\u2019s chest, blocking her against the wall, their mouths meeting in a kiss more and more sensual. Without interrupting the kiss, Heliora rubbed her hand along Yara\u2019s body, then her thigh to finally come and touch the crotch, which made Yara smile naughty.<br>_ \u201cYou\u2019re interested by what\u2019s in store from what I see, it\u2019s good, we\u2019re open all night.\u201d Yara quipped, eager to go further, as did Heliora. Having never done this with a woman in armor, it excited her even more. Both decided to go back inside, Heliora knowing a room where they would be quiet to continue without risking to wake the others.<br>Meanwhile, in the room at the back of the shop dipped in the dark, Daenerys was lying in a single bed, but nevertheless clean and comfortable to sleep peacefully. However, the queen, asleep, did not notice the furtive figure silently approaching the window of the room, looking out onto a deserted, misty street. The form, dressed entirely in black and wearing a hood, glanced quickly through the window, catching sight of the sleeping young queen in the middle of the room.<br>Still in the greatest discretion, the masked individual began to cut the glass pane with a blade, managing to make a hole in the glass large enough to pass a hand. However, he did not try to open the window from inside, but passed something through the hole. A manticore, a deadly venom insect from Essos. The deadly insect began to crawl toward Daenerys\u2019 bed, and slowly began to climb the sheet to hoist itself to the top of the bed and come up to the young woman, who does not suspect anything.<br>From the wharves, Drogon, who was sleeping, suddenly opened his eyes, filled with a sense of danger and fear for his mother. In the living room of the shop, Shen-zoan abruptly came out of his meditation with the same strange feeling and turned to Kinvara.<br>_\u201cYes \u2026 I saw it too \u2026\u201d she confirmed. Without further ado, Shen grabbed his wooden stick, jumped up and as fast as he could, ran to the room where the queen was sleeping. Alerted by the commotion, Yara and Heliora, who did not have time to start their night together, came to see what was happening and saw Shen pass in front of them like an arrow.<br>The manticore had crawled and was now standing very close to Daenerys\u2019s face, getting ready to sting her neck with his hooked dart filled with a more than poisonous poison. The door to the room suddenly opened and Shen burst into the room, and without further ado, with a nimble stick blow and without touching Daenerys, pushed away the poisonous insect that crashed against the wall. Daenerys straightened up, panting and awakened by the noise, to see Shen armed with his staff and looked around the room vigilantly, while Kinvara and the Fiery Hand soldiers came in their turn. Kinvara sat down beside Daenerys on the bed.<br>_ \u201cMy queen, are you all right?\u201d asked the priestess.<br>_\u201cI \u2026 yes, I believe, but what\u2019s going on?\u201d asked Daenerys, more than confused. Shen looked everywhere, and that\u2019s where he saw him. The dark silhouette behind the window, which was starting to flee. Without saying a word and under the dumbfounded gaze of Daenerys, Shen rushed and jumped quickly and agilely through the glass of the window, breaking it into pieces and landing on his feet in the street, in defensive posture. Without further ado, he set off in pursuit of the man dressed in black who was running away with extraordinary speed.<br>Yara and Heliora arrived in the room, noticing the facts and the broken window. Yara came to make sure, asking Daenerys if she was okay. Kinvara leaned forward and gently picked up the crushed corpse of the poisonous insect to reveal it in plain sight. Daenerys felt her heart beat.<br>_ \u201cA manticore \u2026\u201d she says. She had already seen one of these insects, which had also wanted to sting her once. A trap set by the warlocks of Qarth. Were they them again? Did they come to take revenge? Perhaps.<br>A few minutes later, while everyone gathered in the living room with Daenerys, still under the shock of this assassination attempt and supported by Yara sitting next to her. Shen ends up coming back to the shop, empty-handed.<br>_ \u201cHe was going too fast.\u201d he said, \u201cI could not catch him and he seemed to know the streets of this city like his pocket, but he dropped that.\u201d<br>Shen threw a small object, a sort of small piece of iron that Kinvara caught in the palm of her hand and examined closely. Her worst doubts seemed to come true. A very special coin, from Braavos.<br>_ \u201cWhom does it come from?\u201d Yara asked. Kinvara looked at them one by one, hinting at the worst of all.<br>_ \u201cThe Faceless Men.\u201d confirmed the priestess. Daenerys was only more shocked. Like many, she knew the terrifying reputation of those assassins and their mysterious powers. For Shen, it also confirmed something more disturbing than he shared with others.<br>_ \u201cThe Faceless Men never act alone. Someone wants you dead, my queen.\u201d<br></p>",

It was almost as if they were waiting for her coming. Was that the case?<br>Daenerys\u2019 group passed by the entrance of what looked like a temple. Daenerys take a fast look as she passed, she saw, with horror, a crowd of worshipers, chanting incomprehensible words and venerating an idol in the shape of a humanoid goat. One of the worshipers, the leader of the ritual, had covered himself from head to foot with blood, and seemed to be in a trance, convulsing while waving his arms. Yara swallowed when she saw that, just like Shen, and both continued without stopping. Everywhere, they seemed to hear like ritual songs and other incantations coming from the interior of the houses, all in languages \u200b\u200bas varied as strange. What could be happening in this city?<br>_ \u201cWhat is this city of demons?\u201d Yara sighed, notch, just like her two guards. Shen remained calm, but showed his distrust of what was happening here. Kinvara remained calm as usual, and stopped in front of a building in the center of a small deserted square. The sticky sign hanging over the entrance seemed to indicate a bazaar.<br>_\u201cHere we are.\u201d said Kinvara, who without hesitation, pushed the door to enter the first, and inviting the others to follow her inside, which they did, after a few seconds of hesitation.<br>A smell of spices, but also a mixture of incense and other medicinal products came to rub their nostrils as soon as they entered. The place was of average size, but full of objects of all kinds. Small dead animals hung on the ceiling. Pots containing various medicinal products or for any other purpose. Many objects made of bone, wood and other natural elements apparently used for ritual purposes, and even sinister dolls. A little monkey, with red eyes, walked freely between the shelves, emitting curious little sounds against the visitors.<br>Kinvara led the rest of the group to the bottom of the bazaar, where behind a counter, was a person bent to examine the inside of a dead black rat\u2019s corpse and extract its vital organs. The woman behind the counter looked up, and smiled at Kinvara, seeming to know her.<br>_\u201cMy dear Lady Kinvara \u2026. finally we meet again after such a long time \u2026\u201d said the woman from the bazaar in a honeyed and deep voice with an almost seductive tone. She had pale skin, but looked as if she was wearing makeup all over her body and was tattooed on almost the entire face. Long dreadlocks fell on her shoulders, and she was dressed in a strange dress made of animal leather and wore around her neck a pendant made of skulls of sparrows. Her smiling gray lips revealed behind a teething as white as her face. Kinvara greeted her with a nod.<br>_\u201cI greet you, Heliora. I bring you some visitors to spend the night, and they will leave tomorrow morning with me.\u201d<br>The strange young woman named Heliora listened, then her gaze was drawn behind Kinvara\u2019s shoulder towards Daenerys, who was looking around with an edge of suspicion. Heliora\u2019s face seemed to clear, as if she had seen a messiah appear before her.<br>_\u201cYou \u2026\u201d she whispered between her lips as she walked towards Daenerys, who remained frozen in front of the woman staring at her. Yara wanted to intervene, but Shen held her back, making her understand by the look that it was better not to interfere with the people of Asshai. Heliora, with her blackened-fingered hands, felt a little the face of the young dragon queen, examining her from head to foot. Kinvara let her do, knowing her merchant friend well.<br>_ \u201cYou, so young, but already having suffered so many trials, beyond the very veil of life and death \u2026. You, who have long been lost in a quest doomed to failure, but destined for something so much bigger \u2026.. Daenerys of house Targaryen.\u201d<br>Heliora spoke very slowly, mystically, every word seemed to materialize out of her mouth. Daenerys could almost feel her blood-red-iris eyes piercing her mind, as if reading inside her.<br>_ \u201cY \u2026. do you know me?\u201d Daenerys said a little confused. Heliora smiled at her, with the same seductive air as towards Kinvara. Obviously, she preferred women to men. She also glanced at Yara, whose young ironborn queen did not seem to be indifferent and smiled her back.<br>_ \u201cThe reputation of the breaker of chains and mother of dragons has reached the ears of Asshai. Everyone here knows who you are, even those who have no ears to hear or eyes to see.\u201d confirmed Heliora returning to Daenerys. Heliora, whoever or whatever she was, gave her goose bumps.<br>_\u201cYour friends can stay for the night, Kinvara, but you know you have to pay.\u201d Heliora announced, returning to her counter, while giving a small caress to her monkey who come join her.<br>_\u201cOf course.\u201d Kinvara kindly replied, telling one of her Fiery Hand soldiers to come forward, to give her something wrapped in a rag, which she put under the merchant\u2019s eyes. The latter removed the rag, revealing a special dagger. Daenerys gasped as she sees the weapon. It was the dagger with which Jon had killed her. Kinvara had kept it after extracting it. Daenerys felt bad and had to turn away from the sight of the weapon, backed by Yara and Shen. Heliora could not contain her joy at possessing this dagger now, the very one whose blade had been impregnated with the blood of the dragon.<br>_ \u201cYour payment is honest, my dear Kinvara.\u201d Heliora told her, confiding the object to his monkey, who went to hide it somewhere in the shop, out of sight. \u201cYou are welcome in my humble abode, my good lords \u2026.. tonight you can sleep \u2026. But beware, young dragon queen, because at every moment the night is dark and full of terrors.\u201d warned the merchant in a silly little sneer. Uncomfortable, Daenerys chosen to move and guided by Kinvara, goes to the room where she can sleep, while Heliora focuses again on her dead rat on the counter, tearing the heart with forceps.<br>********<br>A little later in the night, Daenerys, despite the gloomy atmosphere of this bazaar, had managed to fall asleep in a room at the back of the shop. The two soldiers of the Fiery Hand, by order of the priestess, would remain all night as sentinels in front of the door of the room. The two ironborn sailors had gone to sleep in the bazaar reserve too. Kinvara, who was not sleepy, had settled into a kind of living room, and was patient, sitting watching the flames dancing gently in the hearth. She was not alone because Shen was there too, sitting with his eyes closed, meditating. Also unable to sleep, Yara had gone outside, under the porch of the shop. Her water bottle in hand, the ironborn queen was nervous and alert, listening to each sound that was heard in the surrounding streets and looking constantly looking for any suspicious movement. The mist, however, did not help to see the area around the store.<br>_ \u201cNervous?\u201d suddenly said Heliora, who like a ghost, had arrived behind Yara, who jumped in surprise and sighed with annoyance.<br>_\u201cYou should be careful, I could have put my ax in your head without wanting it.\u201d Yara warns, taking a sip. Undaunted, Heliora continues to smile and comes closer slowly but surely to Yara, who noticed it well.<br>_\u201cOh, but I don\u2019t doubt it, a proud warrior like you,\u201d commented Heliora, her eye sparkling with a certain lust. Yara guessed it, and she liked it. Their faces are closer to each other.<br>_ \u201cYou know \u2026.\u201d Yara sighed as she came to touch one of the dreadlocks with her fingers and pushed it away from the merchant\u2019s handsome face \u201c\u2026 you\u2019re the most weird and crooked woman I\u2019ve ever met in my fucking life, but I like this.\u201d<br>Heliora did not wait anymore, coming to snuggle against Yara\u2019s chest, blocking her against the wall, their mouths meeting in a kiss more and more sensual. Without interrupting the kiss, Heliora rubbed her hand along Yara\u2019s body, then her thigh to finally come and touch the crotch, which made Yara smile naughty.<br>_ \u201cYou\u2019re interested by what\u2019s in store from what I see, it\u2019s good, we\u2019re open all night.\u201d Yara quipped, eager to go further, as did Heliora. Having never done this with a woman in armor, it excited her even more. Both decided to go back inside, Heliora knowing a room where they would be quiet to continue without risking to wake the others.<br>Meanwhile, in the room at the back of the shop dipped in the dark, Daenerys was lying in a single bed, but nevertheless clean and comfortable to sleep peacefully. However, the queen, asleep, did not notice the furtive figure silently approaching the window of the room, looking out onto a deserted, misty street. The form, dressed entirely in black and wearing a hood, glanced quickly through the window, catching sight of the sleeping young queen in the middle of the room.<br>Still in the greatest discretion, the masked individual began to cut the glass pane with a blade, managing to make a hole in the glass large enough to pass a hand. However, he did not try to open the window from inside, but passed something through the hole. A manticore, a deadly venom insect from Essos. The deadly insect began to crawl toward Daenerys\u2019 bed, and slowly began to climb the sheet to hoist itself to the top of the bed and come up to the young woman, who does not suspect anything.<br>From the wharves, Drogon, who was sleeping, suddenly opened his eyes, filled with a sense of danger and fear for his mother. In the living room of the shop, Shen-zoan abruptly came out of his meditation with the same strange feeling and turned to Kinvara.<br>_\u201cYes \u2026 I saw it too \u2026\u201d she confirmed. Without further ado, Shen grabbed his wooden stick, jumped up and as fast as he could, ran to the room where the queen was sleeping. Alerted by the commotion, Yara and Heliora, who did not have time to start their night together, came to see what was happening and saw Shen pass in front of them like an arrow.<br>The manticore had crawled and was now standing very close to Daenerys\u2019s face, getting ready to sting her neck with his hooked dart filled with a more than poisonous poison. The door to the room suddenly opened and Shen burst into the room, and without further ado, with a nimble stick blow and without touching Daenerys, pushed away the poisonous insect that crashed against the wall. Daenerys straightened up, panting and awakened by the noise, to see Shen armed with his staff and looked around the room vigilantly, while Kinvara and the Fiery Hand soldiers came in their turn. Kinvara sat down beside Daenerys on the bed.<br>_ \u201cMy queen, are you all right?\u201d asked the priestess.<br>_\u201cI \u2026 yes, I believe, but what\u2019s going on?\u201d asked Daenerys, more than confused. Shen looked everywhere, and that\u2019s where he saw him. The dark silhouette behind the window, which was starting to flee. Without saying a word and under the dumbfounded gaze of Daenerys, Shen rushed and jumped quickly and agilely through the glass of the window, breaking it into pieces and landing on his feet in the street, in defensive posture. Without further ado, he set off in pursuit of the man dressed in black who was running away with extraordinary speed.<br>Yara and Heliora arrived in the room, noticing the facts and the broken window. Yara came to make sure, asking Daenerys if she was okay. Kinvara leaned forward and gently picked up the crushed corpse of the poisonous insect to reveal it in plain sight. Daenerys felt her heart beat.<br>_ \u201cA manticore \u2026\u201d she says. She had already seen one of these insects, which had also wanted to sting her once. A trap set by the warlocks of Qarth. Were they them again? Did they come to take revenge? Perhaps.<br>A few minutes later, while everyone gathered in the living room with Daenerys, still under the shock of this assassination attempt and supported by Yara sitting next to her. Shen ends up coming back to the shop, empty-handed.<br>_ \u201cHe was going too fast.\u201d he said, \u201cI could not catch him and he seemed to know the streets of this city like his pocket, but he dropped that.\u201d<br>Shen threw a small object, a sort of small piece of iron that Kinvara caught in the palm of her hand and examined closely. Her worst doubts seemed to come true. A very special coin, from Braavos.<br>_ \u201cWhom does it come from?\u201d Yara asked. Kinvara looked at them one by one, hinting at the worst of all.<br>_ \u201cThe Faceless Men.\u201d confirmed the priestess. Daenerys was only more shocked. Like many, she knew the terrifying reputation of those assassins and their mysterious powers. For Shen, it also confirmed something more disturbing than he shared with others.<br>_ \u201cThe Faceless Men never act alone. Someone wants you dead, my queen.\u201d<br></p>",
                "content": "<p>The ironborn ship had finally reached the mysterious city of Asshai and anchored on a deserted dock, where dozens of crates of abandoned merchandise and some abandoned fishing nets were dragging. Having dressed in her ebony dress and black cloak, Daenerys, accompanied by Kinvara and two soldiers from the Fiery Hand, descended from the footbridge and stepped on the crackling wood of the dock. Finally, on the mainland, she said to herself breathing a great blow, after almost a whole month at sea. Yara then went down, also escorted by two ironborn warriors, and also accompanied by Shen-zoan who volunteered to accompany them. Grey Worm and the remaining of the crew were appointed to guard the ship during the group&rsquo;s absence, who would come back for them tomorrow morning for the start of the inland expedition. Indeed, being too late to leave, Daenerys had decided that they would spend the night in Asshai. The young queen was still too tired to take a long walk, and had to sleep a little. Kinvara made no objection, and guiding Daenerys, offered to show her a safe place she apparently knew and where they could spend the night.<br />Far too big to be able to follow his mother in the streets of Asshai, Drogon was forced to stay on the docks, bigger. The dragon gave a worried, almost childish growl when Daenerys came to him, caressing his muzzle with love and kissing him on the nose. She saw that Drogon was concerned, that he did not like at all the heavy and macabre atmosphere of this city.<br />_ &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back tomorrow, my sweet boy, don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;m in good hands.&rdquo; she said with all the affection she could have for her last son. Drogon moaned again, seeing her leave with the others, but had to resign himself to obey. Drogon looked around him, growling suspiciously against the shadows he thought he saw moving in the recesses of some dark alleyways. Shen-zoan, while walking, came alongside Daenerys.<br />_ &ldquo;Your relationship with this dragon is very surprising, my queen.&rdquo; he commented without passing this for a reproach, quite the contrary.<br />_&ldquo;Drogon is more than a friend, dear Shen &hellip;&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;he is my son, born from the fire, just like me.&rdquo;<br />The traveler was interested in the story, and looked for something in his bag. Something he found and handed to the dragon queen, as a gift. A parchment, on which was drawn in black ink, a very detailed and beautiful portrait of Drogon, in a posture of majestic flight. Daenerys was impressed by the sense of detail and the elegance of the drawing, as if it were almost moving in front of her eyes.<br />_ &ldquo;It&rsquo;s &hellip;. it&rsquo;s beautiful.&rdquo; she said, thanking her new friend for this gift, compliment he received with a humble bow.<br />_ &ldquo;The beauty and majesty of certain things are such that they deserve to be immortalized forever &hellip; Who knows &hellip;.. would you ever want me to make a portrait of you, one day, majesty?&rdquo; he asked very modestly. Daenerys smiled, a little embarrassed, and blushed slightly after what seemed like a compliment to Drogon but also to her, keeping the drawing close to her. Shen suddenly looked a little embarrassed too, seeing her blush.<br />_&ldquo;Forgive me if my remark causes you embarrassment, my queen, I assure you that my attention was not &hellip;&rdquo; he apologized, but was interrupted by the thin hand of Daenerys coming gently take his.<br />_ &ldquo;I would be honored &hellip;.. thank you, my friend.&rdquo; was the answer of the young woman, to the great pleasure of Shen who was reassured.<br />The queen and her escort left the wharves to finally enter the first street of Asshai, between two large black houses with closed shutters. Draped from her red coat with the hood on her head, Kinvara walked in the lead. Behind her, Daenerys, escorted on either side by the two warriors of the Fiery Hand. Behind, closing the march, Yara Greyjoy, her two ironborn guards and Shen-zoan. While walking, Daenerys could finally contemplate with her eyes the city of shadows.<br />The immensity of this city was disconcerting. It was much larger than King&rsquo;s Landing. But despite its size, it seemed almost abandoned, few houses being lit, and the light of the few torches seemed to be absorbed in the darkness of the night. All the buildings were built with black stone, with a disturbing and greasy appearance. The mist had invaded the streets and alleys and snaked on the ground, forming a disturbing carpet of smoke. The architecture of the city was very strange. Palaces built next to brothels and other shabby establishments, and also many temples and other places of worship more or less frequented. According to legend, in Asshai, all religions and cults are allowed, such as the obscure and poorly known cults of the Black Goat and the Lion of Night, or a religion better known as that of the god R'hllor. All kinds of entities were venerated here, such as the moonsingers, the necromancers, the pyromancers, the bloodmages, or the most dreaded of all, the shadowbinders, who were said to be capable of giving birth to demons made up of shadows during very special rituals.<br />The group met a few people, all of whom were hiding under the porches of the houses or in the recesses of the aisles, waiting in silence and watching the group go by without saying a word. Daenerys could see that the inhabitants were all very dressed, hiding the smallest part of their bodies, and were all veiled, wearing masks or hoods. Daenerys could almost feel their eyes on her, and did everything to try to ignore them and kept going, although they did nothing to try to harm her. It was almost as if they were waiting for her coming. Was that the case?<br />Daenerys&rsquo; group passed by the entrance of what looked like a temple. Daenerys take a fast look as she passed, she saw, with horror, a crowd of worshipers, chanting incomprehensible words and venerating an idol in the shape of a humanoid goat.
