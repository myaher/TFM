                "content": "<p>So I&rsquo;ve been reading the leaks and I started to feel worried. I was confident about the situation with Jaime and the way Sansa would react, and I read she was going to talk with Dny and a lot of stuff that worried me a lot. But after seeing the leak episode&hellip; Dear jonsa fam don&rsquo;t panic, without context and without seeing the characters&rsquo; expressions and body language, we don&rsquo;t know what really is going on.</p><p>English is not my first language so there will be mistakes, I apologise in advance.</p><p>Spoiler after this moment. I won&rsquo;t write an analysis because I don&rsquo;t have enough English level to do so. I will write about my feelings after watching the episode.</p><p>So I was really worried about how Sansa was going to react to Jaime&rsquo;s arrival, she didn&rsquo;t have any reason to trust him or forgive him, why would she trust him? But then I watched the episode and Brienne appeared and that was wonderful. And that was just the beginning. She dealt with Jaime&rsquo;s situation wonderfully.</p><p>The conversation with Dny was another thing I was terrified about because Sansa and Dany talking and joking? But when you see the scene in the context the things are not like I thought from the leaks. Sansa is not as cold as the previous episode but she is distant and she asks about the North at the end before they are interrupted and for me, that is the best moment because Sansa is trying to protect her home. And for me, that is the most important exchange between them.</p><p>After that Sansa reunites with Theon and the situation is tense for Dny which has to see the way Sansa and Theon hug after Theon says he will fight for her. And oh my God!!! It&rsquo;s so beautiful, so fucking beautiful and intense. I love their relationship and I had what I wanted till they say goodbye to each other.</p><p>I have to admit that I felt bad for Dany in this episode. She is alone in the North and feels alienated, nothing is going like she thought; nobody sees her as a saviour, or treat her like a queen, Cersei has lied to everyone. And the worst part is, suddenly, she isn&rsquo;t the rightful queen of the seven kingdoms&hellip; I like Dny in this episode because she feels alone and desperate and those emotions are real and I can connect with her when I see her like that. I can see dark!Dny happening after all this and I want that to happen because it can be really interesting and heartbreaking for Dny.</p><p>There is no jonsa, but I was ready for this. Jonsa can&rsquo;t appear in every episode. However, there are other things that are not good for jnerys or Dny. And in my opinion it&rsquo;s good for Sansa (let&rsquo;s not forget she defends Tyrions as well). Furthermore, the gendrya moment&hellip; priceless.</p><p>I want to finish this by saying that we don&rsquo;t have to panic when we read any leaks, without context is difficult to know what is happening for real and they tend to ignore jonsa and Sansa in general.
