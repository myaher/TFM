His fingernails were longer than\nAziraphale\u2019s, albeit buffed to a handsome polish, and he watched Aziraphale\u2019s\nbody shift as he shivered under the touch. He didn\u2019t do it hard enough to leave\na mark, just hard to enough to <i>warn</i>\nhim \u2013 Aziraphale didn\u2019t much like pain, as much as he enjoyed inflicting it on\nCrowley\u2026 And as much as Crowley enjoyed the aforementioned affliction. \u201cStay <i>down</i>.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale was breathing heavily, and\nCrowley watched eagerly as his chest rose and fell, as his belly shifted as he\nbreathed, and a flush had burned from his chest up the length of his neck,\nflourishing in his cheeks. \u201cCrowley,\u201d Aziraphale said breathlessly, \u201cCrowley, I\nwant to kiss you, let me kiss you, let me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss me later,\u201d Crowley said, and he\nshoved Aziraphale\u2019s thighs further apart. Crowley was kneeling on the floor in\nfront of Aziraphale\u2019s armchair, quite clothed, although he\u2019d vanished\nAziraphale\u2019s clothes right away. \u201cI want to try ssssomething\u2026 <i>Different</i>.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d Aziraphale said,\nlooking down at him with his eyes soft, and Crowley wriggled slightly in his\nplace, leaning forward and nuzzling at Aziraphale\u2019s cock, his lips dragging\nover the base of it before he let his tongue flicker out. He liked Aziraphale\u2019s\ncock. It was a good size \u2013 Aziraphale hadn\u2019t given much thought about it when\nhe\u2019d made it, and proportionally\u2026</p><p><i>Mmm</i>. </p><p>Crowley liked the size of it. </p><p>Not that it was especially long, no:\nAziraphale wouldn\u2019t admit to it, but he was reasonably certain that Aziraphale\nhad based his cock on Crowley\u2019s own<a href=\"#_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>,\nand just made adjustments for proportion. Crowley\u2019s cock was like <i>him</i>: a little longer than average,\nslender, <i>handsome. </i>Aziraphale\u2019s cock\nwas like <i>him</i>: short, and fat, and <i>perfect</i>.</p><p>Aziraphale let out a groan as Crowley\nflicked his tongue up the length of him, tracing the neat line of his raphe as\nhe did so, and then he reached forward, cupping his bollocks in his palm and playing\nhis thumb over them, over the soft skin, the scantest traces of hair there. His\ntongue dipped into Aziraphale\u2019s slit, and Aziraphale <i>hissed</i>, his fingers dragging into Crowley\u2019s hair and tightening his\ngrip on the dark locks, and oh, it was <i>wonderful,\n</i>the lovely <i>pain</i> of it, hot drag\nat his scalp. </p><p>His fingers pressed further back, dipping\ndown between the fat cleft of Aziraphale\u2019s buttocks, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh, <i>angel</i>,\u201d\nCrowley muttered, and he dragged the angel forward by the backs of his knees,\nmaking him let out a yelp as he fell down against the back of the armchair, his\narse hanging over the cushion, and a bit of Crowley enjoyed the indignity of\nthat desperate little noise, so <i>sudden</i>,\nso abrupt. \u201cWould you do the whole <i>thing</i>,\nplease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Aziraphale asked\nplaintively, his intonation uneven as Crowley sucked at the frenum, his tongue\ndragging hard against the bundle of nerves there. \u201cOh, <i>Crowley</i>, let me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me, let me, let me!\u201d Crowley repeated,\nsqueezing Aziraphale\u2019s bollocks and hearing him choke out a noise. \u201cAziraphale,\njust do what I <i>tell</i> you for once. Do\nI have to tie you down? Pin you on your back, paint Enochian symbols on your\nchest in my blood and watch you writhe in agony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEcstasy is more my prerogative, dear boy,\u201d\nAziraphale said, a little more smugly than Crowley would like.</p><p>Crowley bit the inside of his thigh, and\nAziraphale wailed. </p><p>\u201cI <i>said</i>,\u201d\nCrowley said, pressing at the back of Aziraphale\u2019s balls once again, \u201cyou need\nto have the whole <i>thing</i>. Where\u2019s your\nprostate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a prostate!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not very accessible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a prostate, Crowley, not a <i>parking</i> spa\u2014 <i>a\u2014</i> <i>Crowley\u2014!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSorry,\u201d</i> Crowley said, throwing his voice without using his mouth, tongue,\nteeth, or lips. \u201c<i>My mouth is full.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cWhat do you need it for, anyway?\u201d Aziraphale\nasked, curling his fingers through Crowley\u2019s hair and dragging at it as Crowley\nswallowed around him, his tongue curling in the most devilish way possible\naround him, wrapping around his cock again and again in <i>inhuman</i> little loops. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014 Oh, my dear, I thought you preferred\nit when I, ah, took the superior position?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not calling it that,\u201d Crowley said,\ndragging his teeth over the crease at one of Aziraphale\u2019s thighs, feeling the\nplump flesh dip and shift under the pressure. \u201cBesides, would you complain if I\n<i>did</i> give as much as I received?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Aziraphale said. \u201cOf course,\nwe both know you\u2019re far too lazy for that.\u201d</p><p>Crowley closed his mouth with a click, and\nleaned back, away from Aziraphale\u2019s crotch. The angel peered down at him, his\nskin flushed, and then he fidgeted in his place, spreading his knees a little\nwider. Aziraphale shifted his hips, grinding slightly up against the empty air:\nhis hands, no longer able to tangle in Crowley\u2019s hair, settled on the arms of\nthe chair. They did not, of course, move that the angel might touch himself,\nbut Crowley could see his fingers twitch. </p><p>Crowley raised his eyebrows. </p><p>\u201c<i>Crowley,\u201d\n</i>Aziraphale said, doing his best to be stern. Of course, it was difficult to\nbe stern whilst whining, which Aziraphale was. </p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrowley, my dear, <i>please</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, <i>do</i> return to your ministrations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ministrations?

You\u2019ve not even got an anus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this fascination with my anus all\nof a sudden? Ordinarily, it\u2019s all about <i>your</i>\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love to begin a passionate fascination\nwith your anus, angel, as soon as you have one for me to be fascinated with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just curious, my dear!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t satisfy that curiosity until I\nhave somewhere to <i>minister</i> my <i>ministrations</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop thinking! Just do what I say!\u201d Aziraphale\nbit his lip, looking down at him, and Crowley leaned in, nuzzling once more at\nAziraphale\u2019s cock and feeling him hiss out a noise as Crowley\u2019s breath ran hot\nover his skin. \u201cAngel, we agreed that I would drive tonight, didn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see,\u201d Aziraphale said, a little snippily,\n\u201cwhy I can\u2019t let you drive, and still know which direction we\u2019re driving in.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Angel</i>,\u201d\nCrowley murmured, and he kissed tenderly from the side of Aziraphale\u2019s knee up\ntoward his thigh, feeling the way he shivered and twitched beneath Crowley\u2019s\nmouth, the white flesh rippling as he jolted and squirmed. He loved Aziraphale\u2019s\nthighs, loved how he could get <i>fistfuls</i>\nof them and just sink into them. They were good thighs \u2013 if he did fuck Aziraphale\ntonight, he wouldn\u2019t even <i>want</i> his\narse. He\u2019d want to sink himself between those thighs, feel them hot and soft\naround his cock, let him drag up against Aziraphale\u2019s, grab at his arse the\nwhole time\u2026 \u201cDon\u2019t you trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d Aziraphale said.</p><p>\u201cAre you frightened of what I might do to\nyou?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>No</i>,\ndon\u2019t be silly.\u201d Aziraphale glanced away from him, his gaze flickering down to\nthe carpet, and Crowley frowned, sliding forward and letting his fingers play\nover Aziraphale\u2019s thighs, even as he drew closer, so that they were chest to\nchest, Crowley\u2019s suit dragging over the oversensitive expanse of Aziraphale\u2019s\nchest. </p><p>\u201cThen what <i>isss</i> it?\u201d Crowley asked, and his tongue flickered out, swiping over\nthe side of Aziraphale\u2019s jaw and making him whimper. Crowley grinned. \u201cOh, issss\nthat it? Do you want me to be <i>nasty</i>\nto you, angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d Aziraphale said.\nThe blossoming blush in his cheeks deepened from \u201crosy\u201d to \u201cfire-engine red\u201d. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s <i>it</i>,\nisn\u2019t it? <i>You</i> don\u2019t want to let me be\nthe <i>superior</i> one unless I rough you\nup a little bit,\u201d Crowley murmured. It wasn\u2019t exactly how they did things, the\nother way around. Aziraphale was certainly <i>condescending</i>,\nand that sent shivers up Crowley\u2019s spine, whenever he topped. Aziraphale would whisper\npoetry and compliments against Crowley\u2019s skin, and whenever he whimpered to\nloudly or complained, or begged, Aziraphale would <i>mock</i> him, soft and low and full of honeyed humour, and that, that\nwas <i>sexy</i>.</p><p>This? This was different, but Crowley\nthought he could manage it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hardly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut <i>up</i>,\nangel,\u201d Crowley murmured, and he dragged Aziraphale\u2019s lip under his teeth,\nwinding his fingers in Aziraphale\u2019s hair and pulling him into a rough, bruising\nkiss. Aziraphale gasped into his mouth, his hands moving to Crowley\u2019s hips, but\nCrowley slapped at the backs of his hands, and Aziraphale let out a heady moan,\ndragging his hands back to himself. \u201cI\u2019m going to do something so <i>nasty</i> to you. That the sort of thing you\u2019re\nlooking for? For me to torture you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN\u2014 No,\u201d Aziraphale said, although the word\ngot stuck in his mouth, and he was looking hungrily at Crowley\u2019s mouth instead\nof at his eyes as Crowley slid down to his knees.</p><p>\u201cGo\u2014 Sa\u2014 <i>Fuck</i>,\u201d Crowley said, and he put his hand forward, dragging his\nthumb over the pink pucker there, pressing down on the muscle. </p><p>Aziraphale shivered.</p><p>\u201cThat it, angel? You want me to make you\nwail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see you try, dear boy,\u201d\nAziraphale said. Crowley leaned forward, breathing over the hole, and he\nwatched it twitch and clench, listened to Aziraphale\u2019s exhalation. \u201cOh,\nCrowley, surely you don\u2019t mean to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel,\u201d Crowley asked, very deliberately, \u201cdo\nyou want me to gag you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, unless you\u2019re begging me to <i>do</i> something, or actually telling me to <i>stop</i>, I don\u2019t want to hear you talk.\nOoh, I suppose you can scream my name in inexorable pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think that likely?\u201d Aziraphale\nasked sceptically.</p><p>Crowley went in tongue-first, and\nAziraphale moaned his name. </p><p>Crowley didn\u2019t press in, right away, just\nlet his tongue trace around the clean, wrinkled muscle: Aziraphale\u2019s skin\ntasted like sunshine and salt, although the salt was far more like sea air rather\nthan the salt that <i>human</i> skin tasted\nof. Aziraphale had heard how human skin was meant to taste, when one licked it,\nbut had never gone to the trouble of licking one to check for himself, and the\napproximation was more than good enough for Crowley, who only licked humans\nwhen it was absolutely necessary.</p><p>\u201cOh, oh, Crowley, that feels\u2026 Oh, that\nfeels\u2026\u201d He trailed off, and Crowley smirked, grabbing at Aziraphale\u2019s thighs\nand pulling them closer, so that Aziraphale\u2019s knees were over his shoulders,\nand immediately, on instinct alone, Aziraphale hooked his feet at the centre of\nCrowley\u2019s back, locking him closer. Crowley wriggled his tongue slightly,\nthreatening to press in, and Aziraphale heaved in a high-pitched gasp as his\ncock gave a <i>beautiful</i> twitch, white\nwetness pearling at the head of it. </p><p>\u201cGood, right?\u201d Crowley murmured, and then\nhe put his mouth back to work, sliding his tongue <i>in</i>: he swiped around the inside of the entrance, feeling the velvet-smooth\nflesh of Aziraphale\u2019s arse under his tongue, and Aziraphale <i>whimpered, </i>his thighs tightening in\neither side of Crowley\u2019s flesh. This? Oh, this wasn\u2019t Heaven, but it was better\n<i>than</i>. Aziraphale\u2019s thighs were warm\nand fat and pillowy, and Crowley let out a low noise in the back of his throat<a href=\"#_ftn2\" title=\"\">[2]</a> as\nhe dragged his tongue back slightly, sucking at Aziraphale\u2019s rim and making him\n<i>keen</i>. </p><p>\u201cOh, it feels <i>divine</i>,\u201d Aziraphale moaned, and Crowley decided not to go for the\nlow-hanging fruit in <i>that</i> statement,\ninstead deciding to shift his tongue forward. Crowley\u2019s tongue was long, serpentine,\nand <i>utterly</i> inhuman. It was capable,\nin fact, of many things a human tongue was not.</p><p>For example, reaching in and sweeping a\nline over the back of the little bundle of nerves that pressed against the wall\nthere, and Aziraphale really <i>did</i>\nscream. It was a loud noise, <i>very</i>\nloud, and his fingers all but <i>tore</i> at\nCrowley\u2019s hair as he ground himself down against Crowley\u2019s mouth, his knees\nlocked either side of his head, and Crowley laughed at the way his cock jumped.\n</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it\u2014 Oh, Crowley, isn\u2019t it dirty?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>I\ndoubt it, angel,\u201d</i> Crowley said dryly, even as his tongue twisted against\nthe inside of his rim and made Aziraphale\u2019s hips jump. \u201c<i>You\u2019ve not even been using this.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cOh, it feels\u2014 <i>Goodness</i>, Crowley, it\u2019s impossible, I really, oh, I\u2019m not hurting you,\nam I? Oh, my <i>dear</i>, do\u2014 <i>ngh</i>, do that again, please, please\u2014\u201d</p><p>Crowley sucked at the sensitive bridge of skin\nbetween Aziraphale\u2019s hole and his cock. What would Aziraphale call it \u2013 his perineum?\nMaybe his <i>guiche</i>, if he was feeling\nromantic. Whatever Aziraphale would call it, sucking it made him <i>shudder</i>, and Crowley began fucking him\nwith his tongue, grasping at his thighs as he did so.</p><p>Aziraphale didn\u2019t even <i>realise</i> he was doing it, Crowley didn\u2019t think, but he was rolling\nhis hips down and against Crowley\u2019s mouth, eager for more\u2026 Oh, yes. Yes, he\u2019d <i>definitely</i> found the good spot here.</p><p>\u201cOh, Crowley, Crowley, Crowley,\u201d Aziraphale\nchoked out, and Crowley twisted his tongue again.</p><p>Aziraphale just\u2026 <i>shattered</i>.</p><p>The noise he made was sixty obscenities in\nitself, his voice cracking, and his thighs <i>squeezed</i>\naround him, as admirably as Crowley ever could, as a constrictor, or like a\ncobra, he could never remember which<a href=\"#_ftn3\" title=\"\">[3]</a>. Crowley\nkept on moving his tongue as Aziraphale rode it out, his cock spasming and pulsing\nagainst his belly, untouched, ad it was\u2014</p><p>Oh, yes.</p><p>Oh, <i>yes</i>,\nCrowley liked this.</p><p>\u201cOh, <i>Crowley</i>,\u201d\nAziraphale choked out, and Crowley slowly withdrew, pressing kisses over the\nsoft flesh of Aziraphale\u2019s belly and looking up at him. Aziraphale wasn\u2019t sweating\n(he didn\u2019t usually like to), but there was a healthy glow to much of his skin,\nand Crowley kept on kissing up the centre of his chest. \u201cOh, Crowley, Crowley\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fuck between your thighs,\u201d\nCrowley decided. \u201cBend you over your desk and make you come <i>just</i> like that\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that was\u2014 It was really very good,\ndear boy, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to <i>bite</i> you,\u201d Crowley said, and he watched Aziraphale squirm. \u201cI\u2019m\ngoing to bite you, and fuck you, and fuck between these thighs of yours until\nyou beg for me to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Aziraphale said softly.</p><p>\u201cDoes that meet with your approval?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Aziraphale mumbled, looking dreamy-eyed\nat Crowley. \u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>Crowley laughed, and began kissing back\ndown. \u201cBut first,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, oh, Crowley, you can hardly do it\nagain, right away, that\u2019s too much, it feels too good, I really couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re a <i>glutton</i>, angel,\u201d Crowley said, his tongue tracing the crease between\nAziraphale\u2019s thigh and his hip, and watching the oversensitive <i>jump</i> he gave. \u201cYou always eat my dessert\nafter finishing yours. Think of it as seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, oh, Crowley, I really\u2014 Oh, Crowley, my\ndear, you\u2019ll <i>kill</i> me, I, I really\nthink I will\u2014\u201d Aziraphale\u2019s whine was stuttered and desperate, but he certainly\ndidn\u2019t flinch away: he ground right up into Crowley\u2019s mouth as Crowley\nswallowed his half-soft cock down, and Crowley, if he could have grinned, <i>would</i> have.</p><p>In the meantime\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh, you <i>wicked</i> thing,\u201d Aziraphale gasped. \u201cDo that again.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a> This was the only reason, Crowley was reasonably certain, that\nAziraphale had bothered with a cock at all, and Crowley was <i>entirely</i> ready, in future, to convince\nhim to try something a little more exciting. </p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref2\" title=\"\">[2]</a> Aziraphale later informed him that this noise was <i>absolutely</i> a growl, and that he would be\never so pleased to hear it again, if Crowley would be so kind.</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref3\" title=\"\">[3]</a> Crowley could never really decide what sort of snake he was\nsupposed to be, and oscillated wildly between herpetological descriptors in any\ncase.

It was a good size \u2013 Aziraphale hadn\u2019t given much thought about it when\nhe\u2019d made it, and proportionally\u2026</p><p><i>Mmm</i>. </p><p>Crowley liked the size of it. </p><p>Not that it was especially long, no:\nAziraphale wouldn\u2019t admit to it, but he was reasonably certain that Aziraphale\nhad based his cock on Crowley\u2019s own<a href=\"#_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>,\nand just made adjustments for proportion. Crowley\u2019s cock was like <i>him</i>: a little longer than average,\nslender, <i>handsome. </i>Aziraphale\u2019s cock\nwas like <i>him</i>: short, and fat, and <i>perfect</i>.</p><p>Aziraphale let out a groan as Crowley\nflicked his tongue up the length of him, tracing the neat line of his raphe as\nhe did so, and then he reached forward, cupping his bollocks in his palm and playing\nhis thumb over them, over the soft skin, the scantest traces of hair there. His\ntongue dipped into Aziraphale\u2019s slit, and Aziraphale <i>hissed</i>, his fingers dragging into Crowley\u2019s hair and tightening his\ngrip on the dark locks, and oh, it was <i>wonderful,\n</i>the lovely <i>pain</i> of it, hot drag\nat his scalp. </p><p>His fingers pressed further back, dipping\ndown between the fat cleft of Aziraphale\u2019s buttocks, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh, <i>angel</i>,\u201d\nCrowley muttered, and he dragged the angel forward by the backs of his knees,\nmaking him let out a yelp as he fell down against the back of the armchair, his\narse hanging over the cushion, and a bit of Crowley enjoyed the indignity of\nthat desperate little noise, so <i>sudden</i>,\nso abrupt. \u201cWould you do the whole <i>thing</i>,\nplease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Aziraphale asked\nplaintively, his intonation uneven as Crowley sucked at the frenum, his tongue\ndragging hard against the bundle of nerves there. \u201cOh, <i>Crowley</i>, let me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me, let me, let me!\u201d Crowley repeated,\nsqueezing Aziraphale\u2019s bollocks and hearing him choke out a noise. \u201cAziraphale,\njust do what I <i>tell</i> you for once. Do\nI have to tie you down? Pin you on your back, paint Enochian symbols on your\nchest in my blood and watch you writhe in agony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEcstasy is more my prerogative, dear boy,\u201d\nAziraphale said, a little more smugly than Crowley would like.</p><p>Crowley bit the inside of his thigh, and\nAziraphale wailed. </p><p>\u201cI <i>said</i>,\u201d\nCrowley said, pressing at the back of Aziraphale\u2019s balls once again, \u201cyou need\nto have the whole <i>thing</i>. Where\u2019s your\nprostate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a prostate!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not very accessible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a prostate, Crowley, not a <i>parking</i> spa\u2014 <i>a\u2014</i> <i>Crowley\u2014!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSorry,\u201d</i> Crowley said, throwing his voice without using his mouth, tongue,\nteeth, or lips. \u201c<i>My mouth is full.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cWhat do you need it for, anyway?\u201d Aziraphale\nasked, curling his fingers through Crowley\u2019s hair and dragging at it as Crowley\nswallowed around him, his tongue curling in the most devilish way possible\naround him, wrapping around his cock again and again in <i>inhuman</i> little loops. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014 Oh, my dear, I thought you preferred\nit when I, ah, took the superior position?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not calling it that,\u201d Crowley said,\ndragging his teeth over the crease at one of Aziraphale\u2019s thighs, feeling the\nplump flesh dip and shift under the pressure. \u201cBesides, would you complain if I\n<i>did</i> give as much as I received?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Aziraphale said. \u201cOf course,\nwe both know you\u2019re far too lazy for that.\u201d</p><p>Crowley closed his mouth with a click, and\nleaned back, away from Aziraphale\u2019s crotch. The angel peered down at him, his\nskin flushed, and then he fidgeted in his place, spreading his knees a little\nwider. Aziraphale shifted his hips, grinding slightly up against the empty air:\nhis hands, no longer able to tangle in Crowley\u2019s hair, settled on the arms of\nthe chair. They did not, of course, move that the angel might touch himself,\nbut Crowley could see his fingers twitch. </p><p>Crowley raised his eyebrows. </p><p>\u201c<i>Crowley,\u201d\n</i>Aziraphale said, doing his best to be stern. Of course, it was difficult to\nbe stern whilst whining, which Aziraphale was. </p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrowley, my dear, <i>please</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, <i>do</i> return to your ministrations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ministrations? I don\u2019t remember\nministering to anything. What was I ministering to?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Me</i>,\ndear boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>You</i>?\nCan\u2019t imagine why I\u2019d do that. You\u2019ve not even got an anus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this fascination with my anus all\nof a sudden? Ordinarily, it\u2019s all about <i>your</i>\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love to begin a passionate fascination\nwith your anus, angel, as soon as you have one for me to be fascinated with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just curious, my dear!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t satisfy that curiosity until I\nhave somewhere to <i>minister</i> my <i>ministrations</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop thinking! Just do what I say!\u201d Aziraphale\nbit his lip, looking down at him, and Crowley leaned in, nuzzling once more at\nAziraphale\u2019s cock and feeling him hiss out a noise as Crowley\u2019s breath ran hot\nover his skin. \u201cAngel, we agreed that I would drive tonight, didn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see,\u201d Aziraphale said, a little snippily,\n\u201cwhy I can\u2019t let you drive, and still know which direction we\u2019re driving in.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Angel</i>,\u201d\nCrowley murmured, and he kissed tenderly from the side of Aziraphale\u2019s knee up\ntoward his thigh, feeling the way he shivered and twitched beneath Crowley\u2019s\nmouth, the white flesh rippling as he jolted and squirmed. He loved Aziraphale\u2019s\nthighs, loved how he could get <i>fistfuls</i>\nof them and just sink into them. They were good thighs \u2013 if he did fuck Aziraphale\ntonight, he wouldn\u2019t even <i>want</i> his\narse. He\u2019d want to sink himself between those thighs, feel them hot and soft\naround his cock, let him drag up against Aziraphale\u2019s, grab at his arse the\nwhole time\u2026 \u201cDon\u2019t you trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d Aziraphale said.</p><p>\u201cAre you frightened of what I might do to\nyou?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>No</i>,\ndon\u2019t be silly.\u201d Aziraphale glanced away from him, his gaze flickering down to\nthe carpet, and Crowley frowned, sliding forward and letting his fingers play\nover Aziraphale\u2019s thighs, even as he drew closer, so that they were chest to\nchest, Crowley\u2019s suit dragging over the oversensitive expanse of Aziraphale\u2019s\nchest. </p><p>\u201cThen what <i>isss</i> it?\u201d Crowley asked, and his tongue flickered out, swiping over\nthe side of Aziraphale\u2019s jaw and making him whimper. Crowley grinned. \u201cOh, issss\nthat it? Do you want me to be <i>nasty</i>\nto you, angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d Aziraphale said.\nThe blossoming blush in his cheeks deepened from \u201crosy\u201d to \u201cfire-engine red\u201d. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s <i>it</i>,\nisn\u2019t it? <i>You</i> don\u2019t want to let me be\nthe <i>superior</i> one unless I rough you\nup a little bit,\u201d Crowley murmured. It wasn\u2019t exactly how they did things, the\nother way around. Aziraphale was certainly <i>condescending</i>,\nand that sent shivers up Crowley\u2019s spine, whenever he topped. Aziraphale would whisper\npoetry and compliments against Crowley\u2019s skin, and whenever he whimpered to\nloudly or complained, or begged, Aziraphale would <i>mock</i> him, soft and low and full of honeyed humour, and that, that\nwas <i>sexy</i>.</p><p>This? This was different, but Crowley\nthought he could manage it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hardly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut <i>up</i>,\nangel,\u201d Crowley murmured, and he dragged Aziraphale\u2019s lip under his teeth,\nwinding his fingers in Aziraphale\u2019s hair and pulling him into a rough, bruising\nkiss. Aziraphale gasped into his mouth, his hands moving to Crowley\u2019s hips, but\nCrowley slapped at the backs of his hands, and Aziraphale let out a heady moan,\ndragging his hands back to himself. \u201cI\u2019m going to do something so <i>nasty</i> to you. That the sort of thing you\u2019re\nlooking for? For me to torture you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN\u2014 No,\u201d Aziraphale said, although the word\ngot stuck in his mouth, and he was looking hungrily at Crowley\u2019s mouth instead\nof at his eyes as Crowley slid down to his knees.</p><p>\u201cGo\u2014 Sa\u2014 <i>Fuck</i>,\u201d Crowley said, and he put his hand forward, dragging his\nthumb over the pink pucker there, pressing down on the muscle. </p><p>Aziraphale shivered.</p><p>\u201cThat it, angel? You want me to make you\nwail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see you try, dear boy,\u201d\nAziraphale said. Crowley leaned forward, breathing over the hole, and he\nwatched it twitch and clench, listened to Aziraphale\u2019s exhalation. \u201cOh,\nCrowley, surely you don\u2019t mean to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel,\u201d Crowley asked, very deliberately, \u201cdo\nyou want me to gag you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, unless you\u2019re begging me to <i>do</i> something, or actually telling me to <i>stop</i>, I don\u2019t want to hear you talk.\nOoh, I suppose you can scream my name in inexorable pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think that likely?\u201d Aziraphale\nasked sceptically.</p><p>Crowley went in tongue-first, and\nAziraphale moaned his name. </p><p>Crowley didn\u2019t press in, right away, just\nlet his tongue trace around the clean, wrinkled muscle: Aziraphale\u2019s skin\ntasted like sunshine and salt, although the salt was far more like sea air rather\nthan the salt that <i>human</i> skin tasted\nof. Aziraphale had heard how human skin was meant to taste, when one licked it,\nbut had never gone to the trouble of licking one to check for himself, and the\napproximation was more than good enough for Crowley, who only licked humans\nwhen it was absolutely necessary.</p><p>\u201cOh, oh, Crowley, that feels\u2026 Oh, that\nfeels\u2026\u201d He trailed off, and Crowley smirked, grabbing at Aziraphale\u2019s thighs\nand pulling them closer, so that Aziraphale\u2019s knees were over his shoulders,\nand immediately, on instinct alone, Aziraphale hooked his feet at the centre of\nCrowley\u2019s back, locking him closer. Crowley wriggled his tongue slightly,\nthreatening to press in, and Aziraphale heaved in a high-pitched gasp as his\ncock gave a <i>beautiful</i> twitch, white\nwetness pearling at the head of it. </p><p>\u201cGood, right?\u201d Crowley murmured, and then\nhe put his mouth back to work, sliding his tongue <i>in</i>: he swiped around the inside of the entrance, feeling the velvet-smooth\nflesh of Aziraphale\u2019s arse under his tongue, and Aziraphale <i>whimpered, </i>his thighs tightening in\neither side of Crowley\u2019s flesh. This? Oh, this wasn\u2019t Heaven, but it was better\n<i>than</i>. Aziraphale\u2019s thighs were warm\nand fat and pillowy, and Crowley let out a low noise in the back of his throat<a href=\"#_ftn2\" title=\"\">[2]</a> as\nhe dragged his tongue back slightly, sucking at Aziraphale\u2019s rim and making him\n<i>keen</i>. </p><p>\u201cOh, it feels <i>divine</i>,\u201d Aziraphale moaned, and Crowley decided not to go for the\nlow-hanging fruit in <i>that</i> statement,\ninstead deciding to shift his tongue forward. Crowley\u2019s tongue was long, serpentine,\nand <i>utterly</i> inhuman. It was capable,\nin fact, of many things a human tongue was not.</p><p>For example, reaching in and sweeping a\nline over the back of the little bundle of nerves that pressed against the wall\nthere, and Aziraphale really <i>did</i>\nscream. It was a loud noise, <i>very</i>\nloud, and his fingers all but <i>tore</i> at\nCrowley\u2019s hair as he ground himself down against Crowley\u2019s mouth, his knees\nlocked either side of his head, and Crowley laughed at the way his cock jumped.\n</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it\u2014 Oh, Crowley, isn\u2019t it dirty?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>I\ndoubt it, angel,\u201d</i> Crowley said dryly, even as his tongue twisted against\nthe inside of his rim and made Aziraphale\u2019s hips jump. \u201c<i>You\u2019ve not even been using this.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cOh, it feels\u2014 <i>Goodness</i>, Crowley, it\u2019s impossible, I really, oh, I\u2019m not hurting you,\nam I? Oh, my <i>dear</i>, do\u2014 <i>ngh</i>, do that again, please, please\u2014\u201d</p><p>Crowley sucked at the sensitive bridge of skin\nbetween Aziraphale\u2019s hole and his cock. What would Aziraphale call it \u2013 his perineum?\nMaybe his <i>guiche</i>, if he was feeling\nromantic. Whatever Aziraphale would call it, sucking it made him <i>shudder</i>, and Crowley began fucking him\nwith his tongue, grasping at his thighs as he did so.</p><p>Aziraphale didn\u2019t even <i>realise</i> he was doing it, Crowley didn\u2019t think, but he was rolling\nhis hips down and against Crowley\u2019s mouth, eager for more\u2026 Oh, yes. Yes, he\u2019d <i>definitely</i> found the good spot here.</p><p>\u201cOh, Crowley, Crowley, Crowley,\u201d Aziraphale\nchoked out, and Crowley twisted his tongue again.</p><p>Aziraphale just\u2026 <i>shattered</i>.</p><p>The noise he made was sixty obscenities in\nitself, his voice cracking, and his thighs <i>squeezed</i>\naround him, as admirably as Crowley ever could, as a constrictor, or like a\ncobra, he could never remember which<a href=\"#_ftn3\" title=\"\">[3]</a>. Crowley\nkept on moving his tongue as Aziraphale rode it out, his cock spasming and pulsing\nagainst his belly, untouched, ad it was\u2014</p><p>Oh, yes.</p><p>Oh, <i>yes</i>,\nCrowley liked this.</p><p>\u201cOh, <i>Crowley</i>,\u201d\nAziraphale choked out, and Crowley slowly withdrew, pressing kisses over the\nsoft flesh of Aziraphale\u2019s belly and looking up at him. Aziraphale wasn\u2019t sweating\n(he didn\u2019t usually like to), but there was a healthy glow to much of his skin,\nand Crowley kept on kissing up the centre of his chest. \u201cOh, Crowley, Crowley\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fuck between your thighs,\u201d\nCrowley decided. \u201cBend you over your desk and make you come <i>just</i> like that\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that was\u2014 It was really very good,\ndear boy, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to <i>bite</i> you,\u201d Crowley said, and he watched Aziraphale squirm. \u201cI\u2019m\ngoing to bite you, and fuck you, and fuck between these thighs of yours until\nyou beg for me to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Aziraphale said softly.</p><p>\u201cDoes that meet with your approval?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Aziraphale mumbled, looking dreamy-eyed\nat Crowley. \u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>Crowley laughed, and began kissing back\ndown. \u201cBut first,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, oh, Crowley, you can hardly do it\nagain, right away, that\u2019s too much, it feels too good, I really couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re a <i>glutton</i>, angel,\u201d Crowley said, his tongue tracing the crease between\nAziraphale\u2019s thigh and his hip, and watching the oversensitive <i>jump</i> he gave. \u201cYou always eat my dessert\nafter finishing yours. Think of it as seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, oh, Crowley, I really\u2014 Oh, Crowley, my\ndear, you\u2019ll <i>kill</i> me, I, I really\nthink I will\u2014\u201d Aziraphale\u2019s whine was stuttered and desperate, but he certainly\ndidn\u2019t flinch away: he ground right up into Crowley\u2019s mouth as Crowley\nswallowed his half-soft cock down, and Crowley, if he could have grinned, <i>would</i> have.</p><p>In the meantime\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh, you <i>wicked</i> thing,\u201d Aziraphale gasped. \u201cDo that again.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a> This was the only reason, Crowley was reasonably certain, that\nAziraphale had bothered with a cock at all, and Crowley was <i>entirely</i> ready, in future, to convince\nhim to try something a little more exciting. </p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref2\" title=\"\">[2]</a> Aziraphale later informed him that this noise was <i>absolutely</i> a growl, and that he would be\never so pleased to hear it again, if Crowley would be so kind.</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref3\" title=\"\">[3]</a> Crowley could never really decide what sort of snake he was\nsupposed to be, and oscillated wildly between herpetological descriptors in any\ncase. The sort of snake Crowley was, at any time, was simply the snake he felt\nlike being. </p></p>",

His fingernails were longer than\nAziraphale\u2019s, albeit buffed to a handsome polish, and he watched Aziraphale\u2019s\nbody shift as he shivered under the touch. He didn\u2019t do it hard enough to leave\na mark, just hard to enough to <i>warn</i>\nhim \u2013 Aziraphale didn\u2019t much like pain, as much as he enjoyed inflicting it on\nCrowley\u2026 And as much as Crowley enjoyed the aforementioned affliction. \u201cStay <i>down</i>.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale was breathing heavily, and\nCrowley watched eagerly as his chest rose and fell, as his belly shifted as he\nbreathed, and a flush had burned from his chest up the length of his neck,\nflourishing in his cheeks. \u201cCrowley,\u201d Aziraphale said breathlessly, \u201cCrowley, I\nwant to kiss you, let me kiss you, let me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss me later,\u201d Crowley said, and he\nshoved Aziraphale\u2019s thighs further apart. Crowley was kneeling on the floor in\nfront of Aziraphale\u2019s armchair, quite clothed, although he\u2019d vanished\nAziraphale\u2019s clothes right away. \u201cI want to try ssssomething\u2026 <i>Different</i>.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d Aziraphale said,\nlooking down at him with his eyes soft, and Crowley wriggled slightly in his\nplace, leaning forward and nuzzling at Aziraphale\u2019s cock, his lips dragging\nover the base of it before he let his tongue flicker out. He liked Aziraphale\u2019s\ncock. It was a good size \u2013 Aziraphale hadn\u2019t given much thought about it when\nhe\u2019d made it, and proportionally\u2026</p><p><i>Mmm</i>. </p><p>Crowley liked the size of it. </p><p>Not that it was especially long, no:\nAziraphale wouldn\u2019t admit to it, but he was reasonably certain that Aziraphale\nhad based his cock on Crowley\u2019s own<a href=\"#_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>,\nand just made adjustments for proportion. Crowley\u2019s cock was like <i>him</i>: a little longer than average,\nslender, <i>handsome. </i>Aziraphale\u2019s cock\nwas like <i>him</i>: short, and fat, and <i>perfect</i>.</p><p>Aziraphale let out a groan as Crowley\nflicked his tongue up the length of him, tracing the neat line of his raphe as\nhe did so, and then he reached forward, cupping his bollocks in his palm and playing\nhis thumb over them, over the soft skin, the scantest traces of hair there. His\ntongue dipped into Aziraphale\u2019s slit, and Aziraphale <i>hissed</i>, his fingers dragging into Crowley\u2019s hair and tightening his\ngrip on the dark locks, and oh, it was <i>wonderful,\n</i>the lovely <i>pain</i> of it, hot drag\nat his scalp. </p><p>His fingers pressed further back, dipping\ndown between the fat cleft of Aziraphale\u2019s buttocks, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh, <i>angel</i>,\u201d\nCrowley muttered, and he dragged the angel forward by the backs of his knees,\nmaking him let out a yelp as he fell down against the back of the armchair, his\narse hanging over the cushion, and a bit of Crowley enjoyed the indignity of\nthat desperate little noise, so <i>sudden</i>,\nso abrupt. \u201cWould you do the whole <i>thing</i>,\nplease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Aziraphale asked\nplaintively, his intonation uneven as Crowley sucked at the frenum, his tongue\ndragging hard against the bundle of nerves there. \u201cOh, <i>Crowley</i>, let me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me, let me, let me!\u201d Crowley repeated,\nsqueezing Aziraphale\u2019s bollocks and hearing him choke out a noise. \u201cAziraphale,\njust do what I <i>tell</i> you for once. Do\nI have to tie you down? Pin you on your back, paint Enochian symbols on your\nchest in my blood and watch you writhe in agony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEcstasy is more my prerogative, dear boy,\u201d\nAziraphale said, a little more smugly than Crowley would like.</p><p>Crowley bit the inside of his thigh, and\nAziraphale wailed. </p><p>\u201cI <i>said</i>,\u201d\nCrowley said, pressing at the back of Aziraphale\u2019s balls once again, \u201cyou need\nto have the whole <i>thing</i>. Where\u2019s your\nprostate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a prostate!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not very accessible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a prostate, Crowley, not a <i>parking</i> spa\u2014 <i>a\u2014</i> <i>Crowley\u2014!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSorry,\u201d</i> Crowley said, throwing his voice without using his mouth, tongue,\nteeth, or lips. \u201c<i>My mouth is full.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cWhat do you need it for, anyway?\u201d Aziraphale\nasked, curling his fingers through Crowley\u2019s hair and dragging at it as Crowley\nswallowed around him, his tongue curling in the most devilish way possible\naround him, wrapping around his cock again and again in <i>inhuman</i> little loops. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014 Oh, my dear, I thought you preferred\nit when I, ah, took the superior position?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not calling it that,\u201d Crowley said,\ndragging his teeth over the crease at one of Aziraphale\u2019s thighs, feeling the\nplump flesh dip and shift under the pressure. \u201cBesides, would you complain if I\n<i>did</i> give as much as I received?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Aziraphale said. \u201cOf course,\nwe both know you\u2019re far too lazy for that.\u201d</p><p>Crowley closed his mouth with a click, and\nleaned back, away from Aziraphale\u2019s crotch. The angel peered down at him, his\nskin flushed, and then he fidgeted in his place, spreading his knees a little\nwider. Aziraphale shifted his hips, grinding slightly up against the empty air:\nhis hands, no longer able to tangle in Crowley\u2019s hair, settled on the arms of\nthe chair. They did not, of course, move that the angel might touch himself,\nbut Crowley could see his fingers twitch. </p><p>Crowley raised his eyebrows. </p><p>\u201c<i>Crowley,\u201d\n</i>Aziraphale said, doing his best to be stern. Of course, it was difficult to\nbe stern whilst whining, which Aziraphale was. </p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrowley, my dear, <i>please</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, <i>do</i> return to your ministrations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ministrations? I don\u2019t remember\nministering to anything. What was I ministering to?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Me</i>,\ndear boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>You</i>?\nCan\u2019t imagine why I\u2019d do that. You\u2019ve not even got an anus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this fascination with my anus all\nof a sudden? Ordinarily, it\u2019s all about <i>your</i>\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love to begin a passionate fascination\nwith your anus, angel, as soon as you have one for me to be fascinated with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just curious, my dear!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t satisfy that curiosity until I\nhave somewhere to <i>minister</i> my <i>ministrations</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop thinking! Just do what I say!\u201d Aziraphale\nbit his lip, looking down at him, and Crowley leaned in, nuzzling once more at\nAziraphale\u2019s cock and feeling him hiss out a noise as Crowley\u2019s breath ran hot\nover his skin. \u201cAngel, we agreed that I would drive tonight, didn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see,\u201d Aziraphale said, a little snippily,\n\u201cwhy I can\u2019t let you drive, and still know which direction we\u2019re driving in.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Angel</i>,\u201d\nCrowley murmured, and he kissed tenderly from the side of Aziraphale\u2019s knee up\ntoward his thigh, feeling the way he shivered and twitched beneath Crowley\u2019s\nmouth, the white flesh rippling as he jolted and squirmed. He loved Aziraphale\u2019s\nthighs, loved how he could get <i>fistfuls</i>\nof them and just sink into them. They were good thighs \u2013 if he did fuck Aziraphale\ntonight, he wouldn\u2019t even <i>want</i> his\narse. He\u2019d want to sink himself between those thighs, feel them hot and soft\naround his cock, let him drag up against Aziraphale\u2019s, grab at his arse the\nwhole time\u2026 \u201cDon\u2019t you trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d Aziraphale said.</p><p>\u201cAre you frightened of what I might do to\nyou?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>No</i>,\ndon\u2019t be silly.\u201d Aziraphale glanced away from him, his gaze flickering down to\nthe carpet, and Crowley frowned, sliding forward and letting his fingers play\nover Aziraphale\u2019s thighs, even as he drew closer, so that they were chest to\nchest, Crowley\u2019s suit dragging over the oversensitive expanse of Aziraphale\u2019s\nchest. </p><p>\u201cThen what <i>isss</i> it?\u201d Crowley asked, and his tongue flickered out, swiping over\nthe side of Aziraphale\u2019s jaw and making him whimper. Crowley grinned. \u201cOh, issss\nthat it? Do you want me to be <i>nasty</i>\nto you, angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d Aziraphale said.\nThe blossoming blush in his cheeks deepened from \u201crosy\u201d to \u201cfire-engine red\u201d. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s <i>it</i>,\nisn\u2019t it? <i>You</i> don\u2019t want to let me be\nthe <i>superior</i> one unless I rough you\nup a little bit,\u201d Crowley murmured. It wasn\u2019t exactly how they did things, the\nother way around. Aziraphale was certainly <i>condescending</i>,\nand that sent shivers up Crowley\u2019s spine, whenever he topped. Aziraphale would whisper\npoetry and compliments against Crowley\u2019s skin, and whenever he whimpered to\nloudly or complained, or begged, Aziraphale would <i>mock</i> him, soft and low and full of honeyed humour, and that, that\nwas <i>sexy</i>.</p><p>This? This was different, but Crowley\nthought he could manage it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hardly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut <i>up</i>,\nangel,\u201d Crowley murmured, and he dragged Aziraphale\u2019s lip under his teeth,\nwinding his fingers in Aziraphale\u2019s hair and pulling him into a rough, bruising\nkiss. Aziraphale gasped into his mouth, his hands moving to Crowley\u2019s hips, but\nCrowley slapped at the backs of his hands, and Aziraphale let out a heady moan,\ndragging his hands back to himself. \u201cI\u2019m going to do something so <i>nasty</i> to you. That the sort of thing you\u2019re\nlooking for? For me to torture you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN\u2014 No,\u201d Aziraphale said, although the word\ngot stuck in his mouth, and he was looking hungrily at Crowley\u2019s mouth instead\nof at his eyes as Crowley slid down to his knees.</p><p>\u201cGo\u2014 Sa\u2014 <i>Fuck</i>,\u201d Crowley said, and he put his hand forward, dragging his\nthumb over the pink pucker there, pressing down on the muscle. </p><p>Aziraphale shivered.</p><p>\u201cThat it, angel? You want me to make you\nwail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see you try, dear boy,\u201d\nAziraphale said. Crowley leaned forward, breathing over the hole, and he\nwatched it twitch and clench, listened to Aziraphale\u2019s exhalation. \u201cOh,\nCrowley, surely you don\u2019t mean to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel,\u201d Crowley asked, very deliberately, \u201cdo\nyou want me to gag you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, unless you\u2019re begging me to <i>do</i> something, or actually telling me to <i>stop</i>, I don\u2019t want to hear you talk.\nOoh, I suppose you can scream my name in inexorable pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think that likely?\u201d Aziraphale\nasked sceptically.</p><p>Crowley went in tongue-first, and\nAziraphale moaned his name. </p><p>Crowley didn\u2019t press in, right away, just\nlet his tongue trace around the clean, wrinkled muscle: Aziraphale\u2019s skin\ntasted like sunshine and salt, although the salt was far more like sea air rather\nthan the salt that <i>human</i> skin tasted\nof. Aziraphale had heard how human skin was meant to taste, when one licked it,\nbut had never gone to the trouble of licking one to check for himself, and the\napproximation was more than good enough for Crowley, who only licked humans\nwhen it was absolutely necessary.</p><p>\u201cOh, oh, Crowley, that feels\u2026 Oh, that\nfeels\u2026\u201d He trailed off, and Crowley smirked, grabbing at Aziraphale\u2019s thighs\nand pulling them closer, so that Aziraphale\u2019s knees were over his shoulders,\nand immediately, on instinct alone, Aziraphale hooked his feet at the centre of\nCrowley\u2019s back, locking him closer. Crowley wriggled his tongue slightly,\nthreatening to press in, and Aziraphale heaved in a high-pitched gasp as his\ncock gave a <i>beautiful</i> twitch, white\nwetness pearling at the head of it. </p><p>\u201cGood, right?\u201d Crowley murmured, and then\nhe put his mouth back to work, sliding his tongue <i>in</i>: he swiped around the inside of the entrance, feeling the velvet-smooth\nflesh of Aziraphale\u2019s arse under his tongue, and Aziraphale <i>whimpered, </i>his thighs tightening in\neither side of Crowley\u2019s flesh. This? Oh, this wasn\u2019t Heaven, but it was better\n<i>than</i>. Aziraphale\u2019s thighs were warm\nand fat and pillowy, and Crowley let out a low noise in the back of his throat<a href=\"#_ftn2\" title=\"\">[2]</a> as\nhe dragged his tongue back slightly, sucking at Aziraphale\u2019s rim and making him\n<i>keen</i>. </p><p>\u201cOh, it feels <i>divine</i>,\u201d Aziraphale moaned, and Crowley decided not to go for the\nlow-hanging fruit in <i>that</i> statement,\ninstead deciding to shift his tongue forward. Crowley\u2019s tongue was long, serpentine,\nand <i>utterly</i> inhuman. It was capable,\nin fact, of many things a human tongue was not.</p><p>For example, reaching in and sweeping a\nline over the back of the little bundle of nerves that pressed against the wall\nthere, and Aziraphale really <i>did</i>\nscream. It was a loud noise, <i>very</i>\nloud, and his fingers all but <i>tore</i> at\nCrowley\u2019s hair as he ground himself down against Crowley\u2019s mouth, his knees\nlocked either side of his head, and Crowley laughed at the way his cock jumped.\n</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it\u2014 Oh, Crowley, isn\u2019t it dirty?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>I\ndoubt it, angel,\u201d</i> Crowley said dryly, even as his tongue twisted against\nthe inside of his rim and made Aziraphale\u2019s hips jump. \u201c<i>You\u2019ve not even been using this.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cOh, it feels\u2014 <i>Goodness</i>, Crowley, it\u2019s impossible, I really, oh, I\u2019m not hurting you,\nam I? Oh, my <i>dear</i>, do\u2014 <i>ngh</i>, do that again, please, please\u2014\u201d</p><p>Crowley sucked at the sensitive bridge of skin\nbetween Aziraphale\u2019s hole and his cock. What would Aziraphale call it \u2013 his perineum?\nMaybe his <i>guiche</i>, if he was feeling\nromantic. Whatever Aziraphale would call it, sucking it made him <i>shudder</i>, and Crowley began fucking him\nwith his tongue, grasping at his thighs as he did so.</p><p>Aziraphale didn\u2019t even <i>realise</i> he was doing it, Crowley didn\u2019t think, but he was rolling\nhis hips down and against Crowley\u2019s mouth, eager for more\u2026 Oh, yes. Yes, he\u2019d <i>definitely</i> found the good spot here.</p><p>\u201cOh, Crowley, Crowley, Crowley,\u201d Aziraphale\nchoked out, and Crowley twisted his tongue again.</p><p>Aziraphale just\u2026 <i>shattered</i>.</p><p>The noise he made was sixty obscenities in\nitself, his voice cracking, and his thighs <i>squeezed</i>\naround him, as admirably as Crowley ever could, as a constrictor, or like a\ncobra, he could never remember which<a href=\"#_ftn3\" title=\"\">[3]</a>. Crowley\nkept on moving his tongue as Aziraphale rode it out, his cock spasming and pulsing\nagainst his belly, untouched, ad it was\u2014</p><p>Oh, yes.</p><p>Oh, <i>yes</i>,\nCrowley liked this.</p><p>\u201cOh, <i>Crowley</i>,\u201d\nAziraphale choked out, and Crowley slowly withdrew, pressing kisses over the\nsoft flesh of Aziraphale\u2019s belly and looking up at him. Aziraphale wasn\u2019t sweating\n(he didn\u2019t usually like to), but there was a healthy glow to much of his skin,\nand Crowley kept on kissing up the centre of his chest. \u201cOh, Crowley, Crowley\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fuck between your thighs,\u201d\nCrowley decided. \u201cBend you over your desk and make you come <i>just</i> like that\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that was\u2014 It was really very good,\ndear boy, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to <i>bite</i> you,\u201d Crowley said, and he watched Aziraphale squirm. \u201cI\u2019m\ngoing to bite you, and fuck you, and fuck between these thighs of yours until\nyou beg for me to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Aziraphale said softly.</p><p>\u201cDoes that meet with your approval?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Aziraphale mumbled, looking dreamy-eyed\nat Crowley. \u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>Crowley laughed, and began kissing back\ndown. \u201cBut first,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, oh, Crowley, you can hardly do it\nagain, right away, that\u2019s too much, it feels too good, I really couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re a <i>glutton</i>, angel,\u201d Crowley said, his tongue tracing the crease between\nAziraphale\u2019s thigh and his hip, and watching the oversensitive <i>jump</i> he gave. \u201cYou always eat my dessert\nafter finishing yours. Think of it as seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, oh, Crowley, I really\u2014 Oh, Crowley, my\ndear, you\u2019ll <i>kill</i> me, I, I really\nthink I will\u2014\u201d Aziraphale\u2019s whine was stuttered and desperate, but he certainly\ndidn\u2019t flinch away: he ground right up into Crowley\u2019s mouth as Crowley\nswallowed his half-soft cock down, and Crowley, if he could have grinned, <i>would</i> have.</p><p>In the meantime\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh, you <i>wicked</i> thing,\u201d Aziraphale gasped. \u201cDo that again.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a> This was the only reason, Crowley was reasonably certain, that\nAziraphale had bothered with a cock at all, and Crowley was <i>entirely</i> ready, in future, to convince\nhim to try something a little more exciting. </p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref2\" title=\"\">[2]</a> Aziraphale later informed him that this noise was <i>absolutely</i> a growl, and that he would be\never so pleased to hear it again, if Crowley would be so kind.</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref3\" title=\"\">[3]</a> Crowley could never really decide what sort of snake he was\nsupposed to be, and oscillated wildly between herpetological descriptors in any\ncase.

His fingernails were longer than\nAziraphale&rsquo;s, albeit buffed to a handsome polish, and he watched Aziraphale&rsquo;s\nbody shift as he shivered under the touch. He didn&rsquo;t do it hard enough to leave\na mark, just hard to enough to <i>warn</i>\nhim &ndash; Aziraphale didn&rsquo;t much like pain, as much as he enjoyed inflicting it on\nCrowley&hellip; And as much as Crowley enjoyed the aforementioned affliction. &ldquo;Stay <i>down</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale was breathing heavily, and\nCrowley watched eagerly as his chest rose and fell, as his belly shifted as he\nbreathed, and a flush had burned from his chest up the length of his neck,\nflourishing in his cheeks. &ldquo;Crowley,&rdquo; Aziraphale said breathlessly, &ldquo;Crowley, I\nwant to kiss you, let me kiss you, let me&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kiss me later,&rdquo; Crowley said, and he\nshoved Aziraphale&rsquo;s thighs further apart. Crowley was kneeling on the floor in\nfront of Aziraphale&rsquo;s armchair, quite clothed, although he&rsquo;d vanished\nAziraphale&rsquo;s clothes right away. &ldquo;I want to try ssssomething&hellip; <i>Different</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re beautiful,&rdquo; Aziraphale said,\nlooking down at him with his eyes soft, and Crowley wriggled slightly in his\nplace, leaning forward and nuzzling at Aziraphale&rsquo;s cock, his lips dragging\nover the base of it before he let his tongue flicker out. He liked Aziraphale&rsquo;s\ncock. It was a good size &ndash; Aziraphale hadn&rsquo;t given much thought about it when\nhe&rsquo;d made it, and proportionally&hellip;</p><p><i>Mmm</i>. </p><p>Crowley liked the size of it. </p><p>Not that it was especially long, no:\nAziraphale wouldn&rsquo;t admit to it, but he was reasonably certain that Aziraphale\nhad based his cock on Crowley&rsquo;s own<a href=\"#_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>,\nand just made adjustments for proportion. Crowley&rsquo;s cock was like <i>him</i>: a little longer than average,\nslender, <i>handsome. </i>Aziraphale&rsquo;s cock\nwas like <i>him</i>: short, and fat, and <i>perfect</i>.</p><p>Aziraphale let out a groan as Crowley\nflicked his tongue up the length of him, tracing the neat line of his raphe as\nhe did so, and then he reached forward, cupping his bollocks in his palm and playing\nhis thumb over them, over the soft skin, the scantest traces of hair there. His\ntongue dipped into Aziraphale&rsquo;s slit, and Aziraphale <i>hissed</i>, his fingers dragging into Crowley&rsquo;s hair and tightening his\ngrip on the dark locks, and oh, it was <i>wonderful,\n</i>the lovely <i>pain</i> of it, hot drag\nat his scalp. </p><p>His fingers pressed further back, dipping\ndown between the fat cleft of Aziraphale&rsquo;s buttocks, and&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>angel</i>,&rdquo;\nCrowley muttered, and he dragged the angel forward by the backs of his knees,\nmaking him let out a yelp as he fell down against the back of the armchair, his\narse hanging over the cushion, and a bit of Crowley enjoyed the indignity of\nthat desperate little noise, so <i>sudden</i>,\nso abrupt. &ldquo;Would you do the whole <i>thing</i>,\nplease?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Aziraphale asked\nplaintively, his intonation uneven as Crowley sucked at the frenum, his tongue\ndragging hard against the bundle of nerves there. &ldquo;Oh, <i>Crowley</i>, let me&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let me, let me, let me!&rdquo; Crowley repeated,\nsqueezing Aziraphale&rsquo;s bollocks and hearing him choke out a noise. &ldquo;Aziraphale,\njust do what I <i>tell</i> you for once. Do\nI have to tie you down? Pin you on your back, paint Enochian symbols on your\nchest in my blood and watch you writhe in agony?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ecstasy is more my prerogative, dear boy,&rdquo;\nAziraphale said, a little more smugly than Crowley would like.</p><p>Crowley bit the inside of his thigh, and\nAziraphale wailed. </p><p>&ldquo;I <i>said</i>,&rdquo;\nCrowley said, pressing at the back of Aziraphale&rsquo;s balls once again, &ldquo;you need\nto have the whole <i>thing</i>. Where&rsquo;s your\nprostate?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have a prostate!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not very accessible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a prostate, Crowley, not a <i>parking</i> spa&mdash; <i>a&mdash;</i> <i>Crowley&mdash;!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo;</i> Crowley said, throwing his voice without using his mouth, tongue,\nteeth, or lips. &ldquo;<i>My mouth is full.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;What do you need it for, anyway?&rdquo; Aziraphale\nasked, curling his fingers through Crowley&rsquo;s hair and dragging at it as Crowley\nswallowed around him, his tongue curling in the most devilish way possible\naround him, wrapping around his cock again and again in <i>inhuman</i> little loops. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash; Oh, my dear, I thought you preferred\nit when I, ah, took the superior position?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not calling it that,&rdquo; Crowley said,\ndragging his teeth over the crease at one of Aziraphale&rsquo;s thighs, feeling the\nplump flesh dip and shift under the pressure. &ldquo;Besides, would you complain if I\n<i>did</i> give as much as I received?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Aziraphale said. &ldquo;Of course,\nwe both know you&rsquo;re far too lazy for that.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley closed his mouth with a click, and\nleaned back, away from Aziraphale&rsquo;s crotch. The angel peered down at him, his\nskin flushed, and then he fidgeted in his place, spreading his knees a little\nwider. Aziraphale shifted his hips, grinding slightly up against the empty air:\nhis hands, no longer able to tangle in Crowley&rsquo;s hair, settled on the arms of\nthe chair. They did not, of course, move that the angel might touch himself,\nbut Crowley could see his fingers twitch. </p><p>Crowley raised his eyebrows. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Crowley,&rdquo;\n</i>Aziraphale said, doing his best to be stern. Of course, it was difficult to\nbe stern whilst whining, which Aziraphale was. </p><p>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Crowley, my dear, <i>please</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please, what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please, <i>do</i> return to your ministrations.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My ministrations? I don&rsquo;t remember\nministering to anything. What was I ministering to?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Me</i>,\ndear boy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>You</i>?\nCan&rsquo;t imagine why I&rsquo;d do that. You&rsquo;ve not even got an anus.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this fascination with my anus all\nof a sudden? Ordinarily, it&rsquo;s all about <i>your</i>&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I would love to begin a passionate fascination\nwith your anus, angel, as soon as you have one for me to be fascinated with.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just curious, my dear!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t satisfy that curiosity until I\nhave somewhere to <i>minister</i> my <i>ministrations</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stop thinking! Just do what I say!&rdquo; Aziraphale\nbit his lip, looking down at him, and Crowley leaned in, nuzzling once more at\nAziraphale&rsquo;s cock and feeling him hiss out a noise as Crowley&rsquo;s breath ran hot\nover his skin. &ldquo;Angel, we agreed that I would drive tonight, didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; Aziraphale said, a little snippily,\n&ldquo;why I can&rsquo;t let you drive, and still know which direction we&rsquo;re driving in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Angel</i>,&rdquo;\nCrowley murmured, and he kissed tenderly from the side of Aziraphale&rsquo;s knee up\ntoward his thigh, feeling the way he shivered and twitched beneath Crowley&rsquo;s\nmouth, the white flesh rippling as he jolted and squirmed. He loved Aziraphale&rsquo;s\nthighs, loved how he could get <i>fistfuls</i>\nof them and just sink into them. They were good thighs &ndash; if he did fuck Aziraphale\ntonight, he wouldn&rsquo;t even <i>want</i> his\narse. He&rsquo;d want to sink himself between those thighs, feel them hot and soft\naround his cock, let him drag up against Aziraphale&rsquo;s, grab at his arse the\nwhole time&hellip; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you trust me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; Aziraphale said.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you frightened of what I might do to\nyou?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>No</i>,\ndon&rsquo;t be silly.&rdquo; Aziraphale glanced away from him, his gaze flickering down to\nthe carpet, and Crowley frowned, sliding forward and letting his fingers play\nover Aziraphale&rsquo;s thighs, even as he drew closer, so that they were chest to\nchest, Crowley&rsquo;s suit dragging over the oversensitive expanse of Aziraphale&rsquo;s\nchest. </p><p>&ldquo;Then what <i>isss</i> it?&rdquo; Crowley asked, and his tongue flickered out, swiping over\nthe side of Aziraphale&rsquo;s jaw and making him whimper. Crowley grinned. &ldquo;Oh, issss\nthat it? Do you want me to be <i>nasty</i>\nto you, angel?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; Aziraphale said.\nThe blossoming blush in his cheeks deepened from &ldquo;rosy&rdquo; to &ldquo;fire-engine red&rdquo;. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s <i>it</i>,\nisn&rsquo;t it? <i>You</i> don&rsquo;t want to let me be\nthe <i>superior</i> one unless I rough you\nup a little bit,&rdquo; Crowley murmured. It wasn&rsquo;t exactly how they did things, the\nother way around. Aziraphale was certainly <i>condescending</i>,\nand that sent shivers up Crowley&rsquo;s spine, whenever he topped. Aziraphale would whisper\npoetry and compliments against Crowley&rsquo;s skin, and whenever he whimpered to\nloudly or complained, or begged, Aziraphale would <i>mock</i> him, soft and low and full of honeyed humour, and that, that\nwas <i>sexy</i>.</p><p>This? This was different, but Crowley\nthought he could manage it.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s hardly&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shut <i>up</i>,\nangel,&rdquo; Crowley murmured, and he dragged Aziraphale&rsquo;s lip under his teeth,\nwinding his fingers in Aziraphale&rsquo;s hair and pulling him into a rough, bruising\nkiss. Aziraphale gasped into his mouth, his hands moving to Crowley&rsquo;s hips, but\nCrowley slapped at the backs of his hands, and Aziraphale let out a heady moan,\ndragging his hands back to himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to do something so <i>nasty</i> to you. That the sort of thing you&rsquo;re\nlooking for? For me to torture you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;N&mdash; No,&rdquo; Aziraphale said, although the word\ngot stuck in his mouth, and he was looking hungrily at Crowley&rsquo;s mouth instead\nof at his eyes as Crowley slid down to his knees.</p><p>&ldquo;Go&mdash; Sa&mdash; <i>Fuck</i>,&rdquo; Crowley said, and he put his hand forward, dragging his\nthumb over the pink pucker there, pressing down on the muscle. </p><p>Aziraphale shivered.</p><p>&ldquo;That it, angel? You want me to make you\nwail?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see you try, dear boy,&rdquo;\nAziraphale said. Crowley leaned forward, breathing over the hole, and he\nwatched it twitch and clench, listened to Aziraphale&rsquo;s exhalation. &ldquo;Oh,\nCrowley, surely you don&rsquo;t mean to&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Angel,&rdquo; Crowley asked, very deliberately, &ldquo;do\nyou want me to gag you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then, unless you&rsquo;re begging me to <i>do</i> something, or actually telling me to <i>stop</i>, I don&rsquo;t want to hear you talk.\nOoh, I suppose you can scream my name in inexorable pleasure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think that likely?&rdquo; Aziraphale\nasked sceptically.</p><p>Crowley went in tongue-first, and\nAziraphale moaned his name. </p><p>Crowley didn&rsquo;t press in, right away, just\nlet his tongue trace around the clean, wrinkled muscle: Aziraphale&rsquo;s skin\ntasted like sunshine and salt, although the salt was far more like sea air rather\nthan the salt that <i>human</i> skin tasted\nof. Aziraphale had heard how human skin was meant to taste, when one licked it,\nbut had never gone to the trouble of licking one to check for himself, and the\napproximation was more than good enough for Crowley, who only licked humans\nwhen it was absolutely necessary.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, oh, Crowley, that feels&hellip; Oh, that\nfeels&hellip;&rdquo; He trailed off, and Crowley smirked, grabbing at Aziraphale&rsquo;s thighs\nand pulling them closer, so that Aziraphale&rsquo;s knees were over his shoulders,\nand immediately, on instinct alone, Aziraphale hooked his feet at the centre of\nCrowley&rsquo;s back, locking him closer. Crowley wriggled his tongue slightly,\nthreatening to press in, and Aziraphale heaved in a high-pitched gasp as his\ncock gave a <i>beautiful</i> twitch, white\nwetness pearling at the head of it. </p><p>&ldquo;Good, right?&rdquo; Crowley murmured, and then\nhe put his mouth back to work, sliding his tongue <i>in</i>: he swiped around the inside of the entrance, feeling the velvet-smooth\nflesh of Aziraphale&rsquo;s arse under his tongue, and Aziraphale <i>whimpered, </i>his thighs tightening in\neither side of Crowley&rsquo;s flesh. This? Oh, this wasn&rsquo;t Heaven, but it was better\n<i>than</i>. Aziraphale&rsquo;s thighs were warm\nand fat and pillowy, and Crowley let out a low noise in the back of his throat<a href=\"#_ftn2\" title=\"\">[2]</a> as\nhe dragged his tongue back slightly, sucking at Aziraphale&rsquo;s rim and making him\n<i>keen</i>. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it feels <i>divine</i>,&rdquo; Aziraphale moaned, and Crowley decided not to go for the\nlow-hanging fruit in <i>that</i> statement,\ninstead deciding to shift his tongue forward. Crowley&rsquo;s tongue was long, serpentine,\nand <i>utterly</i> inhuman. It was capable,\nin fact, of many things a human tongue was not.</p><p>For example, reaching in and sweeping a\nline over the back of the little bundle of nerves that pressed against the wall\nthere, and Aziraphale really <i>did</i>\nscream. It was a loud noise, <i>very</i>\nloud, and his fingers all but <i>tore</i> at\nCrowley&rsquo;s hair as he ground himself down against Crowley&rsquo;s mouth, his knees\nlocked either side of his head, and Crowley laughed at the way his cock jumped.\n</p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it&mdash; Oh, Crowley, isn&rsquo;t it dirty?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>I\ndoubt it, angel,&rdquo;</i> Crowley said dryly, even as his tongue twisted against\nthe inside of his rim and made Aziraphale&rsquo;s hips jump. &ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;ve not even been using this.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it feels&mdash; <i>Goodness</i>, Crowley, it&rsquo;s impossible, I really, oh, I&rsquo;m not hurting you,\nam I? Oh, my <i>dear</i>, do&mdash; <i>ngh</i>, do that again, please, please&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley sucked at the sensitive bridge of skin\nbetween Aziraphale&rsquo;s hole and his cock. What would Aziraphale call it &ndash; his perineum?\nMaybe his <i>guiche</i>, if he was feeling\nromantic. Whatever Aziraphale would call it, sucking it made him <i>shudder</i>, and Crowley began fucking him\nwith his tongue, grasping at his thighs as he did so.</p><p>Aziraphale didn&rsquo;t even <i>realise</i> he was doing it, Crowley didn&rsquo;t think, but he was rolling\nhis hips down and against Crowley&rsquo;s mouth, eager for more&hellip; Oh, yes. Yes, he&rsquo;d <i>definitely</i> found the good spot here.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Crowley, Crowley, Crowley,&rdquo; Aziraphale\nchoked out, and Crowley twisted his tongue again.</p><p>Aziraphale just&hellip; <i>shattered</i>.</p><p>The noise he made was sixty obscenities in\nitself, his voice cracking, and his thighs <i>squeezed</i>\naround him, as admirably as Crowley ever could, as a constrictor, or like a\ncobra, he could never remember which<a href=\"#_ftn3\" title=\"\">[3]</a>. Crowley\nkept on moving his tongue as Aziraphale rode it out, his cock spasming and pulsing\nagainst his belly, untouched, ad it was&mdash;</p><p>Oh, yes.</p><p>Oh, <i>yes</i>,\nCrowley liked this.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>Crowley</i>,&rdquo;\nAziraphale choked out, and Crowley slowly withdrew, pressing kisses over the\nsoft flesh of Aziraphale&rsquo;s belly and looking up at him. Aziraphale wasn&rsquo;t sweating\n(he didn&rsquo;t usually like to), but there was a healthy glow to much of his skin,\nand Crowley kept on kissing up the centre of his chest. &ldquo;Oh, Crowley, Crowley&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to fuck between your thighs,&rdquo;\nCrowley decided. &ldquo;Bend you over your desk and make you come <i>just</i> like that&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, that was&mdash; It was really very good,\ndear boy, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to <i>bite</i> you,&rdquo; Crowley said, and he watched Aziraphale squirm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m\ngoing to bite you, and fuck you, and fuck between these thighs of yours until\nyou beg for me to stop.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Aziraphale said softly.</p><p>&ldquo;Does that meet with your approval?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; Aziraphale mumbled, looking dreamy-eyed\nat Crowley. &ldquo;Yes, please.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley laughed, and began kissing back\ndown. &ldquo;But first,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, oh, Crowley, you can hardly do it\nagain, right away, that&rsquo;s too much, it feels too good, I really couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re a <i>glutton</i>, angel,&rdquo; Crowley said, his tongue tracing the crease between\nAziraphale&rsquo;s thigh and his hip, and watching the oversensitive <i>jump</i> he gave. &ldquo;You always eat my dessert\nafter finishing yours. Think of it as seconds.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, oh, Crowley, I really&mdash; Oh, Crowley, my\ndear, you&rsquo;ll <i>kill</i> me, I, I really\nthink I will&mdash;&rdquo; Aziraphale&rsquo;s whine was stuttered and desperate, but he certainly\ndidn&rsquo;t flinch away: he ground right up into Crowley&rsquo;s mouth as Crowley\nswallowed his half-soft cock down, and Crowley, if he could have grinned, <i>would</i> have.</p><p>In the meantime&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you <i>wicked</i> thing,&rdquo; Aziraphale gasped. &ldquo;Do that again.&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a> This was the only reason, Crowley was reasonably certain, that\nAziraphale had bothered with a cock at all, and Crowley was <i>entirely</i> ready, in future, to convince\nhim to try something a little more exciting. </p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref2\" title=\"\">[2]</a> Aziraphale later informed him that this noise was <i>absolutely</i> a growl, and that he would be\never so pleased to hear it again, if Crowley would be so kind.</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref3\" title=\"\">[3]</a> Crowley could never really decide what sort of snake he was\nsupposed to be, and oscillated wildly between herpetological descriptors in any\ncase. The sort of snake Crowley was, at any time, was simply the snake he felt\nlike being. </p></p>",
