Don\u2019t be so clingy.\u201d<b><br/></b></p><p>\u201cBut it will be a few more weeks before he actually gets the letter, so by the time he reads it, he will have been gone two months, now won\u2019t he?\u201d Tony pushed Steve further away. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not\u2026 <i>clingy</i>. He <i>asked </i>me to write to him. Very nicely I might add. How could I say no?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe asked you to&ndash;\u201d Steve shook his head. \u201cHe <i>asked </i>you to write to him? Like you\u2019re his girl or something?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fairly certain Bucky knows I\u2019m not a <i>girl</i>.\u201d Tony deadpanned. \u201cBut he asked me to be his fella, yeah. I have to admit, no one has ever asked me out quite like that before. It was&hellip; charming.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCharming.\u201d Steve sat back in the seat, thin arms folded. \u201cAnd you said\u2026 yes. To being Bucky\u2019s fella.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, I did.\u201d Tony signed the short letter with a quick flourish. \u201cHave you ever had that guy ask you anything? One look at those baby blues and I\u2019d give him a new car.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony paused, fully expecting Steve to laugh, but the blonde stayed silent. \u201cUm, should I have asked you for you blessing first?\u201d he asked curiously. \u201cYou\u2019re sort of scowling at me like I\u2019m sneaking around with your sister when she\u2019s supposed to be at the convent.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAm not.\u201d Steve scrunched his nose in irritation. \u201cI got no problem with it. You two wanna be together, then&ndash;\u201d\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, really, you\u2019re looking at me like I\u2019m trying to get under Sister Margaret&rsquo;s habit.\u201d Tony stuffed the letter into an envelope and turned back to Steve. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you? I thought you didn\u2019t have a problem with me and Bucky?\u201d\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a problem.\u201d Steve insisted. \u201cI was just&ndash; I was just wondering. Is it always that easy?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIs <i>what </i>always that easy?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat you and Bucky have!\u201d Steve\u2019s voice rose a little and Tony frowned at him in confusion. \u201cYou make it look so easy! Is it always like that? You know, you meet someone, think they\u2019re real fine lookin\u2019? Flirt a little, fall into bed and then you\u2019re in love? Is it that easy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh&ndash;\u201d Tony cleared his throat. \u201cUh, Steve, Bucky and I aren\u2019t&ndash;I mean, I don\u2019t think we are&ndash;Um&ndash; I mean, yeah its worked out really well for us since we only knew each other a week, but I wouldn\u2019t say we are&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t seem fair is all.\u201d A disappointed shrug, Steve not even listening to Tony\u2019s stammered speech. \u201cBucky don\u2019t even like girls, has to hide who he is all the time cos people kinda hate people like him, and he <i>still </i>finds love before me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh. That&ndash; that wasn\u2019t what I was expecting you to say.\u201d Tony looked a little closer at Steve, noting the tired lines around his eyes, the weariness in the sloop of his shoulder. \u201cSteve, are you&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you help me talk to Agent Carter?\u201d Steve interrupted. \u201cShe\u2019s so pretty, and I like her alot and today\u2019s going to be the first time I\u2019m spending time with her alone, and I\u2019m nervous about it. You have any advice?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou want my advice on how to talk to Agent Carter.\u201d Tony repeated, covering his mouth with his hand so Steve wouldn\u2019t know he wanted to laugh. \u201cWhat makes you think I know how to talk to girls? All you\u2019ve seen is me flirt with Bucky and honestly, it hasn&rsquo;t been that smooth. I know you think its been easy, but considering&ndash;\u201d Tony closed his eyes briefly, thinking about how close to a mental breakdown he\u2019d been the first few days.\u00a0\u201cConsidering everything that has been going on, its fairly amazing anything happened at all between me and Bucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you love him.\u201d Steve said matter of factly.\u00a0\u201cSo obviously something is right about you two.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI&ndash;\u201d Tony started to deny that he loved Bucky, but Steve looked so sure about it all, that the words sort of died on his tongue.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re right. There is something&hellip; <i>right </i>about Bucky and I.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>&ldquo;There\u2019s something right about Agent Carter too.\u201d Steve said wistfully.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know what it is, Tony. We\u2019ve only talked a handful of times, but I want to know her. Can you help me with that?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re doing just fine with her by yourself.\u201d Tony patted his shoulder.\u00a0\u201cShe likes you, Steve, trust me.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to call you a liar, Tony, but&ndash;\u201d Steve motioned down his body.\u00a0\u201cI need all the help I can get, and that means more than my friend reassuring me, you know?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Tony jumped to his feet and motioned for Steve to stand up too. \u201cI\u2019m going to give you the same advice my Honeybear&ndash;\u201d a blank look, and Tony explained, \u201c&ndash;my best friend. I\u2019m going to give you the same advice my best friend gave me when I started dating.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Steve stood up slowly, wiping his hands down his slacks. \u201cWas it good advice?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUm\u2026\u201d Tony pursed his lips. \u201cUm, okay so the thing about my Honeybear is that he <i>thinks </i>he has great advice, and maybe it <i>is </i>great advice when you\u2019re as good looking as he is, but for those of us that have to work at being cute&ndash;\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou sweet on your\u2026 honeybear\u2026 too?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony stopped in surprise and Steve raised his eyebrows in question. \u201cOh, because I called him good looking?\u201d A quick shake of his head. \u201cUh no, not sweet on him. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Rhodey is a snack but&ndash;\u201d </p><p>\u201cA <i>what</i>?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting off topic.\u201d Tony grinned and cleared his throat. \u201cAlright, Steve, the first dating advice Rhodey ever gave me was exactly this:: Stand up straight, <i>never </i>ask how they are doing, <i>always </i>compliment their shoes.\u201d </p><p>\u201cStand up straight.\u201d Steve squared his shoulders, tilting his chin up. \u201cNever ask how they are &ndash; Wait, why wouldn\u2019t I ask how Agent Carter is doing? That\u2019s just being polite, what\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBecause <i>you </i>might think you are just asking how she\u2019s doing.\u201d Tony fussed with Steve\u2019s tie. \u201cBut you come out sounding like a total Joey.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand that reference.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t.\u201d Tony backed up a few steps, folded his arms over his chest, looked Steve over from top to toe, and then smirked and asked, \u201cHow <i>you </i>doing?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d Steve scowled at him. \u201cThat is <i>awful</i>, why would you say it like that? Why do you sound so&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cCreepy?\u201d Tony finished.\u00a0\u201cYep, it sounds <i>creepy</i>, that\u2019s why we don\u2019t ask how she is doing. Instead, you could smile and ask how her day is going. It lets her know that you are interested in her activities, but also is a generic enough question that she can reply <i>fine </i>and leave without being rude. If she wants to keep talking to you, she can. If she doesn\u2019t want to, she isn\u2019t trapped into a conversation that she feels obligated to continue, you know?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fair.\u201d Steve nodded thoughtfully. \u201cSo I ask her how her days is going, and then I compliment her shoes?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy her shoes?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBecause if you\u2019re going to check her out, you should at least say something nice and every woman likes to talk about her shoes.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTony, I\u2019m not going to check her&ndash;\u201d </p><p>Tony just <i>looked </i>at him, and Steve sighed and looked away. </p><p>\u201cYep, that\u2019s what I thought. Stand up straight, ask how her day is, say something nice about her shoes. Fool proof.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah? It\u2019s worked for you the first time?\u201d Steve reached for his khaki shirt, buttoning it up before tucking his tie in. \u201cFool proof?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt worked like a champ.\u201d Tony promised, running his fingers over the pleats in Steve\u2019s hat before handing it over. \u201cRight up until my date for the evening realized I was too young to buy her a drink, and then I struck out <i>spectacularly</i>, but you don\u2019t have to worry about either of those things because you are old enough to buy Agent Carter a beer, <i>and </i>she already likes you.\u201d </p><p>He leaned away to look over Steve\u2019s outfit critically. \u201cAnd after they give you this top secret serum, you\u2019ll be a snack too so&ndash;\u201d </p><p>\u201cA <i>snack</i>?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Tony grinned and clapped a hand on Steve\u2019s shoulder. \u201cEveryone in the room will want to take a bite out of you.\u201d </p><p>\u201c&hellip;.thanks?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou are very welcome.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>**********************</p><p>**********************</p><p>\u201cRemind me again why it was necessary for Mr. Carbonell to join us on our little expedition?\u201d Peggy asked as she marched down the long hallway, Steve almost jogging to catch up, Tony trailing a step behind, fully content to smirk at the back of his friends head. </p><p>\u201cTony is one of my best friends.\u201d Steve shot Tony a look over his shoulder. \u201cAnd I thought I was allowed someone in there with me for support.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI thought you would bring a priest.\u201d Peggy took a file from someone and signed her name quickly before handing it back, never missing a step. \u201cOr your <i>bookie</i>. Not my driver. I wasn\u2019t even aware the two of you were friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently best friends.\u201d Tony said with a pleased grin.\u00a0\u201cAnd I am happy to pray over Steve if he needs it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t need prayers, Tony, thank you. And also, I don\u2019t gamble, ma\u2019am.\u201d Steve was quick to assure Peggy, and with another uncertain glance back at Tony, he added, \u201cI like your shoes, ma\u2019am.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d Peggy stopped so quickly that Tony almost smacked into her. \u201cI must have misheard you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am.\u201d Steve shook his head. \u201cI simply noticed you had new shoes, thought to comment on them.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou are about to undergo an extremely experimental, entirely life altering procedure, and you wanted to take the time to talk about my <i>shoes</i>?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI would also like to take the time to ask how your day is.\u201d Steve straightened his lean frame, eyebrows raised invitingly. \u201cOr if you had done anything interesting.\u201d </p><p>Peggy narrowed her eyes at him, and Tony made an impressed noise when Steve didn\u2019t so much as flinch, keeping the same open expression and easy smile. </p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she began slowly. \u201cI am very tense today as you can imagine, since my particular branch of the armed forces is responsible for everything that happens in the next few hours. I spent a short and yet rather informative drive sitting across from a the most stubborn soldier I\u2019ve ever met&ndash;\u201d her gaze met his meaningfully, and then flicked to Tony. \u201c&ndash;and his consistently overdressed friend, so <i>yes</i>, you could say I\u2019ve had an interesting day so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Steve cleared his throat. \u201cAnd&ndash;and your shoes?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMy shoes are new.\u201d Peggy gave him a brief smile. \u201cVery sweet of you to notice, also very <i>surprising </i>that you noticed.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIf I can be bold?\u201d Steve cleared his throat.\u00a0\u201cI notice just about everything about you, Agent Carter.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Peggy\u2019s eyes flickered, her hand going to her hair to adjust a curl that didn\u2019t need to be adjusted at all, and Tony hid his smile.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Seems like Aunt Peggy had developed that little nervous tic of hers <i>decades </i>before Tony picked up on it.</p><p>\u201cRight, well gentlemen, we are going to be late if we dilly dally and longer. Shall we?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cRight. Right of course.\u201d Steve started walking again when Peggy did, and when he looked back again, Tony shot him a thumbs up and an exaggerated wink. </p><p>Rhodey\u2019s advice was fool proof.<i> Get\u00a0\u2018em Cap.</i></p><p>Bolstered by the positive response from Peggy, Steve was just opening his mouth to say something else that maybe slightly resembled flirting, but Peggy pushed through a huge set of double doors and suddenly they were in a lab big enough to even bring <i>Tony </i>to a surprised halt. </p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019ll be a son of a bit&ndash;\u201d </p><p>\u201cAh- ah. Language Mr. Carbonell.\u201d Peggy said at the same time Steve said, \u201cTony! <i>Language</i>!\u201d </p><p>Tony looked between the two of them with an amused smile, and Peggy tinged the slightest bit pink when Steve grinned at her. \u201cImagine that, I\u2019m friends with <i>two </i>people who don\u2019t approve of my language.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI wonder how many other things we have in common, Agent Carter.\u201d Steve added, closing one blue eyes in a rather bold wink. </p><p>\u201cWell then.\u201d Peggy cleared her throat and touched her hair again. \u201cThey are waiting for you down below, Rogers. Mr. Carbonell, you are welcome to come down to the floor with us, but please maintain a respectful distance. It is very kind of you to accompany Mr. Rogers for emotional support, but I still can\u2019t have you down on the floor and in the way, so say your goodbye now?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Tony stepped back and Steve moved with him, standing close enough that Tony could grab his hand. \u201cGo on and meet your destiny, blondie. This is going be amazing.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThanks for coming with me.\u201d Steve muttered, tightening his hold on Tony\u2019s fingers.\u00a0\u201cMeans a lot.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even worry about it. I\u2019ll be here when everything is over too, alright?\u201d Over Steve\u2019s head, Peggy was tapping her foot a little impatiently and Tony nodded that he saw.\u00a0\u201cYou have to go though, here comes Dr. Erskine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, Tony\u2014\u201c Steve looked a little panicked, but he didn\u2019t have time to finish his thought as Dr Erskine came up to shake his hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d Tony mouthed and flashed Steve a double thumbs up. \u201cYou got it, Steve. You got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm&ndash;\u201d Steve kept looking back over his shoulder as Dr. Erskine led him onto the platform, and Tony was struck all over again by how vulnerable this Steve was, and how well he hid it behind that stubborn jaw. </p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d he repeated quietly, and tried to smile, relieved when Steve finally smiled back at him. </p><p>\u201cSheesh, someone get that kid a sandwich.\u201d Someone muttered behind Tony, and he turned around to snark back but stopped mid motion when he saw Steve climb up onto the table, looking paler, skinnier without his shirt, and the <i>enormity </i>of the situation hit him all at once.</p><p>Tony <i>knew </i>the serum worked of course, he knew that it was painful and that they had blacked out half of Brooklyn with the surge, and that Steve fell out of that chamber a shocking six foot two and two hundred plus pounds of All American beefcake.</p><p>Tony knew <i>all </i>of that. </p><p>But that knowledge didn\u2019t stop him from leaning over the rail and watching closely, straining to see every emotion that crossed Steve\u2019s face, the tiny twitches and the way his breathing picked up, fidgeting with his fingers, starting to bit at his bottom lip and then stopping himself. </p><p><i>Captain America is scared to death. </i></p><p>\u201cCan I go down there with him?\u201d Tony blurted before he could stop himself. \u201cAgent Carter, can I go down there with him? He shouldn\u2019t be alone right now, look at him! He needs someone there with him!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMr. Carbonell, if they kicked me off the operating room floor, I have very little doubt they will demand you leave as well.\u201d Peggy\u2019s voice was regretful.\u00a0\u201cI wish i could stand next to him too, but this is something he has to do alone.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Tony cursed under his breath.\u00a0\u201c<i>Right</i>.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt is good of you to want to be there for your friend, though.\u201d she added after a few seconds. \u201cHow long have you two known each other?\u201d </p><p>\u201c&hellip;years.\u201d Tony answered quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve known him for <i>years </i>but it\u2019s only been the last little while that we\u2019ve gotten closer.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky to have each other.\u201d </p><p>\u201c&hellip;yeah.\u201d he nodded slowly. \u201cYeah we are.\u201d </p><p>********************</p><p>********************</p><p>\u201cAre you comfortable?\u201d Dr. Erskine asked, touching the straps around Steve\u2019s midsection. \u201cI\u2019m afraid this is the tightest they go.\u201d </p><p>Steve licked his lips before answering, \u201cIt\u2019s a little big.\u201d When Dr. Erskine laughed, Steve added, \u201cDid you save me any of the schnapps?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot as much as I should have.\u201d the scientist patted his arm and chuckled again, and turned to start making a speech to the military personnel gathered in the room. </p><p>Steve tuned out most of it, the words only a buzz in his ears as he stared around at the bright lights and machinery that was powering up across from him. </p><p>Mr. Stark approached him, hooking leads up to his chest and Steve smiled a little thinking about how excited Bucky would have been to be meeting <i>Howard Stark</i> of all people, then frowned a few seconds later because he knew Bucky would hate this. </p><p>He would <i>hate </i>it. </p><p>Steve started trembling thinking about his best friend, his heart pounding as he thought first about how upset Bucky would be, and then how good it would be to go on to fight side by side with him. How good it would be to put on that uniform and run out side by side. It was all he wanted. All he had <i>ever </i>wanted and now it was so close he could almost&ndash;</p><p>Howard glanced up from all the dials and levers in front of him to lay a reassuring hand on Steve\u2019s arm when his rising heart rate made the machine start beeping. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, soldier.\u201d he said with an easy wink. \u201cThe doc told me you were at the Expo? I can promise that this all works much better than my flying car.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI uh&ndash; I thought your car worked pretty well.\u201d Steve said lamely.\u00a0\u201cSure seemed like it would be alright, maybe.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Howard went back to adjusting the levers or dials or <i>whatever </i>it all was. \u201cYou must have seen a different demonstration, because I\u2019m pretty sure mine was terrible.\u201d He smiled and Steve couldn\u2019t help smiling back. \u201cYou have bigger things to worry about than flying cars though. I\u2019d like to say this is all roses, but it\u2019s going to give you a hell of a headache and probably growing pains so&ndash;\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>Growing pains</i>?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUh yep.\u201d Howard studied Steve for a minute. \u201cI bet this little jolt in the ass will put almost a foot of height on you. More than a hundred pounds definitely. You\u2019ll be able to catch the eye of whoever you want.\u201d he cracked a grin that was so surprisingly <i>familiar </i>that all Steve could do was blink in surprise. \u201cMostly because you\u2019ll be too big for them to ignore, huh? Huh?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat was a terrible joke.\u201d Steve laughed and Howard shrugged it off.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, I make jokes whenever I\u2019m uncomfortable.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI know other people who do that.\u201d Steve squinted through the lights until he could make out Peggy standing straight and tall at the top of the stairs, and then he looked next to here to what was definitely Tony, fedora sat at a ridiculous angle, leaning over the railing and staring down at Steve. </p><p><i>Huh</i>.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Dr. Erskine was back, and Steve forced his eyes back to the doctor.</p><p>\u201cIs it too late to go to the bathroom?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re ready.\u201d Erskine smiled once more at Steve and then motioned to Mr. Stark. \u201cShall we?\u201d </p><p>*******************</p><p>*******************</p><p>From the stories, Tony had thought it would take <i>ages</i>. </p><p>Howard always talked about this part as if it had dragged on for days&ndash; the machines powering up, the brightening light, the way Steve screamed and then refused to let them shut it down even though everyone was scrambling to pull the plug. Howard shouting the percentages, Peggy with both hands over her mouth, the gathered generals and senators murmuring uncertainly. The heart stopping moment where everything hit a <i>hundred </i>and then started winding down, the pod opening with a hiss and Steve nearly falling out of it, staggering on his new legs and dragging in deep breaths. </p><p>Howard had always talked about it as if it had dragged on for days, but it was over in a matter of minutes, and Tony didn\u2019t take his eyes off the pod once.</p><p>Everyone was talking, shouting in surprise and amazement when Steve straightened to his newly impressive height. Peggy pushed her way through the crowd to get up close and personal with Steve and Tony wanted to laugh when he saw her reach out to touch a more than defined pec, pulling her hand away at the last minute and touching her hair nervously. </p><p>Steve was grinning, staring down at himself, looking around at all the people he was suddenly towering over, finally looking up and meeting Tony\u2019s eyes across the space. </p><p>Tony offered a wave and a little smile, hoping Steve\u2019s vision hadn\u2019t sharpened enough to see the sadness he couldn\u2019t quite hide. </p><p>Howard had always talked about it as if it had dragged on for days, but it had been barely one breath to the next, and the Steve Tony had just barely gotten to know was was gone, Captain America standing in his place. </p><p>It all happened so much faster than Howard had said. </p><p>Everything else happened in record time, though. </p><p>Tony was just starting to walk down the stairs when the explosion rocked the lab and people started screaming. </p><p>Too caught up in the moment, Tony had forgotten about this, had forgotten about the HYDRA agent that had been in the same room.\u00a0</p><p>The bomb knocked threw him into the wall, and Tony was just getting to his feet again, palms scraped, nose bleeding, when gun shots sounded and the agent came running up the stairs past him.\u00a0</p><p>Tony reached out to stop him, grabbed onto the a trouser leg to try and slow him down, but a swift kick to his ribs had him rolling further down the stairs, wheezing and holding on to his sides. </p><p>Peggy and Steve went flying past him just like they were supposed to, Peggy with her gun already drawn, Steve stumbling over his feet as he tried to get used to his new height, and when he skittered to a stop to try and check on Tony, Tony only waved him on. </p><p>He was fine. He knew Steve had to get out the door and after that HYDRA agent because waiting even a <i>minute </i>would mean that Steve would be too late to swim after the submarine, and the man would escape, and it would ruin everything.\u00a0</p><p>History couldn\u2019t stop, not even for Tony\u2019s most likely broken ribs. </p><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Tony\u2019s eyes shot open wide when Howard leaned over to offer him a hand up. \u201cThat was quite a fall you took. You dead, dying or-\u201d </p><p>\u201c&ndash;bleeding.\u201d Tony interrupted, pulling his hand from his nose to show Howard the blood. \u201cNo. Not dead or dying, but I am bleeding so&ndash;\u201d</p><p>Howard stared at him in confusion, and Tony realized belatedly that he had finished his dad\u2019s sentence, and that that was <i>weird</i>.</p><p>\u201cAh, sorry. My dad always said the same thing to me.\u201d Wow it was&hellip; <i>different</i>&hellip;to lie to his dad and not really be lying at all.\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to interrupt you.\u201d</p><p>Time travel. <i>Sheesh</i>. </p><p>\u201cCivilian, huh?\u201d Howard pulled Tony to his feet, trying not to jostle his ribs. \u201cHow did you manage to be invited to this sort of thing? This is supposed to be military brass and Capitol Hill employees only.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Agent Carter\u2019s driver.\u201d Tony said blandly and Howard\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cAnd um, Steve\u2019s friend?\u201d Another unimpressed look. \u201cAlso, I know a lot about this sort of thing.\u201d he motioned around the room. \u201cSo. Several reasons to be here.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou know a lot about this sort of thing?\u201d Howard repeated. \u201c<i>Really</i>? Because I built these machines by hand. The blueprints don\u2019t even exist outside of my head. What exactly do you think you know about this sort of thing?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>And there it was&ndash; that condescending, caustic tone that Howard had perfected by the time Tony was old enough to argue with him. A mocking, usually rhetorical question delivered with a cutting smile and a faux interested expression.\u00a0</p><p>Fortunately, or maybe unfortunately, Tony wasn\u2019t a ten year old kid looking for his dad\u2019s approval anymore, so he stared Howard down for a long minute before cocking his head and turning to look over at the only machine still running in the nearly destroyed lab.\u00a0</p><p>All the needles in the displays were edging towards red as the huge server began to overheat, a terrible whining noise coming from the overworked fans as they ran non stop trying to force the machine to cool before things started melting or possibly exploding.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat do I know about this sort of thing?\u201d Tony repeated and limped over to the machine, dropping to his knees and rolling onto his back before scooting underneath it.\u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t mind if I fix this do you? Nah, you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing!\u201d Howard cried.\u00a0\u201cThat machine is worth more than your&ndash;\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShush.\u201d Tony held a finger out and crawled deeper beneath it, groaning as his ribs pulled.\u00a0\u201cGive me a sec. I\u2019m not used to such low tech but I should be able to&ndash;\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLOW TECH! I\u2019ll have you know&ndash;!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Shush</i>!\u201d Tony said louder, and with a little maneuvering, managed to separate the wires that were crossed beneath the baseboard, rerouting one of them into a different server, shocking himself terribly, but grinning when the machine finally fell silent, the fans slowing to a more manageable pace as the unit started regulating its own temperature again. </p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d A pained grunt as he stood back up and fixed Howard with a smug look. \u201cNow at least that annoying noise isn\u2019t happening anymore.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI&ndash;I&ndash;\u201d Howard was speechless, and Tony was about as happy as he had ever been, finally getting a chance to show his father up. \u201cUm, what did you say you did again?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAgent Carter\u2019s driver.\u201d Tony supplied. \u201cBut I dabble in mechanics too. More of a hobby than anything.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d Howard narrowed his eyes and Tony straightened under the suspicious gaze, waiting for the accusations of spying in Howard\u2019s work, of cutting corners, for there to be no way that Tony knew how to do that, so he must be cheating&ndash;</p><p>\u201cSmart ass.\u201d Howard finally said, and when Tony only blinked at him, Howard laughed. \u201cI like it. Seems to me like your wasted driving Agent. Carter around but hey, I\u2019d do it if it gave me a chance to be close to her too.\u201d </p><p>\u201cUh&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, while they are tracking down Nazi\u2019s&ndash;\u201d Howard motioned out the door to where Peggy and Steve had chased the HYDRA agent. \u201cAnd they are\u2026mourning.\u201d a flicker of sadness as he looked over to where Dr. Erskine was lying covered in a sheet. \u201cI have machinery to fix. Do you want to help, or do you have something else going on?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Tony shook his head, already rolling up his sleeves. \u201cLet\u2019s fix some things.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Howard grinned and Tony grinned right back, his heart aching a little seeing a smile that he had <i>rarely </i>seen growing up. \u201cThis isn\u2019t too low tech for you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll manage.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWell, grab a wrench, then.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>*******************</p><p>*******************</p><p>That night, Tony found Steve standing on the balcony of his hotel room, staring out across the city with a forlorn expression, his arms folded tight across his chest. </p><p>\u201cSteve.\u201d Tony reached up&ndash; <i>ugh</i>, he hated that&ndash; to put a hand on Steve\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about Dr. Erskine.\u201d </p><p>Steve didn\u2019t answer, and Tony joined him at the rail. \u201cHow are you feeling? Any weird side effects?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a headache for about three minutes.\u201d he said shortly. \u201cLegs hurt. Arms hurt from growing so much.\u201d he dragged in a deep breath. \u201cRibs don\u2019t hurt though. Feel like I can breathe for the first time in my life. Heartbeats steady. It\u2019s nice.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s&hellip;good.\u201d Tony murmured, and fell silent, waiting for Steve to say whatever else was on his mind. </p><p>It took a full ten minutes of silence between them but Steve finally said, \u201cThey want me to go on tour with a USO show. Encourage people to buy bonds and volunteer for the cause and all that. Say that a big guy like me in a red white and blue outfit would be the perfect patriotic symbol.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlright?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThey gave me a promotion.\u201d Steve continued. \u201c<i>Captain America</i> they want to call me. Yesterday I was plain old Steve Rogers, now I\u2019m a <i>Captain</i>. Bucky would be so proud.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSteve&ndash;\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to be a <i>soldier</i>, Tony. I went through with this whole thing so I could go and fight Nazi\u2019s, so I could save people, and now I\u2019ll be the equivalent of a circus animal. Dressed up, trotted out, paraded around for money while pretty girls sing. It\u2019s&ndash; it\u2019s humiliating.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSteve&ndash;\u201d </p><p>\u201cI should have stayed home and collected scrap metal.\u201d He said bitterly. \u201cWould be making just as much of a difference huh? Dr. Erskine died for this, for <i>me</i>, and I can\u2019t even live up to what he expected from me. He said I was special, said I was good, that the serum would amplify all of that but&ndash;\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou <i>are </i>special, Steve.\u201d Tony started helplessly. \u201cI mean, you are&ndash;\u201d </p><p>\u201cEverything special about me came out of a test tube!\u201d Steve shouted, and Tony backed up a step in surprise, his hand going to his chest as it started hurting, remembering another conversation between the two of them that had gone much the same way. </p><p>Except <i>Tony </i>had been saying those words, and had been too angry to register the hurt in Steve\u2019s eyes&ndash; the hurt he could see so plainly right now.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing special about me.\u201d Steve repeated. \u201cSure, I can lift a motorcycle now. I can run faster than most cars, I can&ndash; I mean, I caught a <i>submarine </i>Tony. Caught it and ripped the top off. Last week I couldn\u2019t make it up the stairs to our apartment without coughing. Today, I jumped an eight foot fence without blinking. But it&rsquo;s all the serum. And even <i>with </i>the serum I\u2019m still someone that can\u2019t go to war, someone who is being told he can\u2019t fight, someone who isn\u2019t good enough.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not good enough, Tony.\u201d He was whispering now, big shoulders slumped in resignation. \u201cEven after all this. I\u2019m <i>still not good enough</i>.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI&ndash;\u201d Tony didn\u2019t know what to say, didn\u2019t even know where to start. \u201cUm, Steve&ndash;\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow did you like Howard?\u201d Steve changed the subject and Tony blinked a few times in surprise. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a prick.\u201d he said slowly. \u201cBut brilliant. Probably a good guy to keep around. Why do you ask?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think Peggy likes him.\u201d Steve made a fist, staring down at his hand. \u201cThey do this weird thing where they look at each other and don\u2019t say anything and then smile and I don\u2019t know what to do with that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fairly certain Peggy has no interest in Mr. Stark.\u201d Tony denied instantly, shuddering over the thought of his aunt and his father hooking up. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter anyway.\u201d Steve pushed away from the railing, moving back into his room. \u201cShe\u2019s going to go off to war, and I\u2019m going to head to a stage with a line of dancing girls. No sense pining over someone I can\u2019t have.\u201d </p><p>He slumped onto the bed, and after a few seconds of hesitation, Tony climbed right onto the bed next to him, close enough that their shoulders bumped. </p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be all bad.\u201d he said carefully and Steve closed his eyes with a muffled groan. \u201cNo, I\u2019m serious.\u201d Tony nudged him playfully. \u201cI mean, with that new booty, you will look <i>great </i>in tights.\u201d </p><p>A long, tense moment, and Steve finally started to smile, then he was chuckling and when Tony started grinning, it turned into full fledged laughter until both of them were gasping for breath wiping tears from their eyes. </p><p>\u201cTony&ndash; Tony this has been the craziest day of my life.\u201d Steve admitted, reaching for a glass of water. \u201cWho I was this morning and who I am now, everything that\u2019s happened&ndash;\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the same person tonight that you were this morning.\u201d Tony said firmly. \u201cJust you know, taller.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo am I a <i>snack </i>now, Tony?\u201d </p><p>\u201cA whole damn <i>meal</i>, Captain America.\u201d Tony shoved at him. \u201cJust be careful, there\u2019s a whole world of women out there who would love to experience that meal first hand. </p><p>\u201cOh good Christ, don\u2019t call me Captain America.\u201d Steve slid further down in the sheets, closing his eyes and yawning loudly. \u201cThat sounds awful. I hate that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI bet you\u2019ll learn to like it.\u201d Tony started to get off the bed. \u201cAnd don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t notice that you didn\u2019t comment on how terrible it will be to have all those pretty women trying to take a bite out of you. I\u2019m on to you Rogers.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything, Tony.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI know more than you think, Spangles. Like that your giant ass needs to sleep.\u201d Tony flipped a few lights off. \u201cI hear show business is a demanding life, all the make up and the glitter and the costumes and the&ndash;\u201d</p><p>A pillow was winged at him and Tony <i>acked</i>! as he went down beneath it. </p><p>\u201cOh shit!\u201d Steve leapt from the bed and helped Tony back up. \u201cSorry about that, Tony, I forgot to check my strength. Still getting used to it all. Didn\u2019t mean to flatten you like that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Captain America</i>.\u201d Tony huffed and grabbed his hat off the ground. \u201cYou are setting a terrible example for children across the country by starting unprovoked pillow fights with civilians. <i>Honestly</i>.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Completely unrepentant, Steve only grinned before flopping back on the bed. \u201cGood night, Tony.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGood night, Steve.\u201d </p><p>Tony closed the door and crossed the room to the one that had been provided for him by Steve\u2019s new boss, Senator Brandt. </p><p>It hadn&rsquo;t taken much convincing at all to encourage the Senator that Tony was Steve\u2019s manager, the one to be handling his finances because the Senator wouldn\u2019t <i>dream </i>of using Steve as an employee of the United States, putting him through all the physical strain of performing and traveling without cutting him a paycheck, wasn&rsquo;t that right? Steve was patriotic, but <i>no one</i> was that patriotic. </p><p>The Senator had smiled a wonderfully fake smile, shaken Tony\u2019s hand and proclaimed him part of the project and now here they were, set for a rehearsal by the end of the week, a first show by the end of next. </p><p>The Star Spangled Man with a Plan was about to take America by storm, inspire comics and cartoons and movies and all of that sort of thing, and Tony was going to be right next to him for it all. </p><p>Tony checked the date on the calender on the wall, his hand a bit unsteady as he touched the page. </p><p>Steve was Captain America now, which was the first big step to start everything else off.\u00a0</p><p>It was only a matter of time before they ended up over seas, performing for the 107th, finding Bucky, <i>losing </i>Bucky&mdash;</p><p>It was only a matter of time, and as Tony stretched out on the hotel bed, he stared up at the ceiling and started counting down the days until the end.</p><p>**********************</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnC55Xt5xdhEUuVPTO0Orvw\">@bornwithgasolineheart</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\"

I thought you didn\u2019t have a problem with me and Bucky?\u201d\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a problem.\u201d Steve insisted. \u201cI was just\u2013 I was just wondering. Is it always that easy?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIs <i>what </i>always that easy?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat you and Bucky have!\u201d Steve\u2019s voice rose a little and Tony frowned at him in confusion. \u201cYou make it look so easy! Is it always like that? You know, you meet someone, think they\u2019re real fine lookin\u2019? Flirt a little, fall into bed and then you\u2019re in love? Is it that easy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2013\u201d Tony cleared his throat. \u201cUh, Steve, Bucky and I aren\u2019t\u2013I mean, I don\u2019t think we are\u2013Um\u2013 I mean, yeah its worked out really well for us since we only knew each other a week, but I wouldn\u2019t say we are\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t seem fair is all.\u201d A disappointed shrug, Steve not even listening to Tony\u2019s stammered speech. \u201cBucky don\u2019t even like girls, has to hide who he is all the time cos people kinda hate people like him, and he <i>still </i>finds love before me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh. That\u2013 that wasn\u2019t what I was expecting you to say.\u201d Tony looked a little closer at Steve, noting the tired lines around his eyes, the weariness in the sloop of his shoulder. \u201cSteve, are you\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you help me talk to Agent Carter?\u201d Steve interrupted. \u201cShe\u2019s so pretty, and I like her alot and today\u2019s going to be the first time I\u2019m spending time with her alone, and I\u2019m nervous about it. You have any advice?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou want my advice on how to talk to Agent Carter.\u201d Tony repeated, covering his mouth with his hand so Steve wouldn\u2019t know he wanted to laugh. \u201cWhat makes you think I know how to talk to girls? All you\u2019ve seen is me flirt with Bucky and honestly, it hasn\u2019t been that smooth. I know you think its been easy, but considering\u2013\u201d Tony closed his eyes briefly, thinking about how close to a mental breakdown he\u2019d been the first few days.\u00a0\u201cConsidering everything that has been going on, its fairly amazing anything happened at all between me and Bucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you love him.\u201d Steve said matter of factly.\u00a0\u201cSo obviously something is right about you two.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2013\u201d Tony started to deny that he loved Bucky, but Steve looked so sure about it all, that the words sort of died on his tongue.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re right. There is something\u2026 <i>right </i>about Bucky and I.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something right about Agent Carter too.\u201d Steve said wistfully.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know what it is, Tony. We\u2019ve only talked a handful of times, but I want to know her. Can you help me with that?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re doing just fine with her by yourself.\u201d Tony patted his shoulder.\u00a0\u201cShe likes you, Steve, trust me.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to call you a liar, Tony, but\u2013\u201d Steve motioned down his body.\u00a0\u201cI need all the help I can get, and that means more than my friend reassuring me, you know?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Tony jumped to his feet and motioned for Steve to stand up too. \u201cI\u2019m going to give you the same advice my Honeybear\u2013\u201d a blank look, and Tony explained, \u201c\u2013my best friend. I\u2019m going to give you the same advice my best friend gave me when I started dating.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Steve stood up slowly, wiping his hands down his slacks. \u201cWas it good advice?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUm\u2026\u201d Tony pursed his lips. \u201cUm, okay so the thing about my Honeybear is that he <i>thinks </i>he has great advice, and maybe it <i>is </i>great advice when you\u2019re as good looking as he is, but for those of us that have to work at being cute\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou sweet on your\u2026 honeybear\u2026 too?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony stopped in surprise and Steve raised his eyebrows in question. \u201cOh, because I called him good looking?\u201d A quick shake of his head. \u201cUh no, not sweet on him. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Rhodey is a snack but\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cA <i>what</i>?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting off topic.\u201d Tony grinned and cleared his throat. \u201cAlright, Steve, the first dating advice Rhodey ever gave me was exactly this:: Stand up straight, <i>never </i>ask how they are doing, <i>always </i>compliment their shoes.\u201d </p><p>\u201cStand up straight.\u201d Steve squared his shoulders, tilting his chin up. \u201cNever ask how they are \u2013 Wait, why wouldn\u2019t I ask how Agent Carter is doing? That\u2019s just being polite, what\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBecause <i>you </i>might think you are just asking how she\u2019s doing.\u201d Tony fussed with Steve\u2019s tie. \u201cBut you come out sounding like a total Joey.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand that reference.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t.\u201d Tony backed up a few steps, folded his arms over his chest, looked Steve over from top to toe, and then smirked and asked, \u201cHow <i>you </i>doing?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d Steve scowled at him. \u201cThat is <i>awful</i>, why would you say it like that? Why do you sound so\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cCreepy?\u201d Tony finished.\u00a0\u201cYep, it sounds <i>creepy</i>, that\u2019s why we don\u2019t ask how she is doing. Instead, you could smile and ask how her day is going. It lets her know that you are interested in her activities, but also is a generic enough question that she can reply <i>fine </i>and leave without being rude. If she wants to keep talking to you, she can. If she doesn\u2019t want to, she isn\u2019t trapped into a conversation that she feels obligated to continue, you know?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fair.\u201d Steve nodded thoughtfully. \u201cSo I ask her how her days is going, and then I compliment her shoes?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy her shoes?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBecause if you\u2019re going to check her out, you should at least say something nice and every woman likes to talk about her shoes.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTony, I\u2019m not going to check her\u2013\u201d </p><p>Tony just <i>looked </i>at him, and Steve sighed and looked away. </p><p>\u201cYep, that\u2019s what I thought. Stand up straight, ask how her day is, say something nice about her shoes. Fool proof.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah? It\u2019s worked for you the first time?\u201d Steve reached for his khaki shirt, buttoning it up before tucking his tie in. \u201cFool proof?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt worked like a champ.\u201d Tony promised, running his fingers over the pleats in Steve\u2019s hat before handing it over. \u201cRight up until my date for the evening realized I was too young to buy her a drink, and then I struck out <i>spectacularly</i>, but you don\u2019t have to worry about either of those things because you are old enough to buy Agent Carter a beer, <i>and </i>she already likes you.\u201d </p><p>He leaned away to look over Steve\u2019s outfit critically. \u201cAnd after they give you this top secret serum, you\u2019ll be a snack too so\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cA <i>snack</i>?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Tony grinned and clapped a hand on Steve\u2019s shoulder. \u201cEveryone in the room will want to take a bite out of you.\u201d </p><p>\u201c\u2026.thanks?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou are very welcome.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>**********************</p><p>**********************</p><p>\u201cRemind me again why it was necessary for Mr. Carbonell to join us on our little expedition?\u201d Peggy asked as she marched down the long hallway, Steve almost jogging to catch up, Tony trailing a step behind, fully content to smirk at the back of his friends head. </p><p>\u201cTony is one of my best friends.\u201d Steve shot Tony a look over his shoulder. \u201cAnd I thought I was allowed someone in there with me for support.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI thought you would bring a priest.\u201d Peggy took a file from someone and signed her name quickly before handing it back, never missing a step. \u201cOr your <i>bookie</i>. Not my driver. I wasn\u2019t even aware the two of you were friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently best friends.\u201d Tony said with a pleased grin.\u00a0\u201cAnd I am happy to pray over Steve if he needs it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t need prayers, Tony, thank you. And also, I don\u2019t gamble, ma\u2019am.\u201d Steve was quick to assure Peggy, and with another uncertain glance back at Tony, he added, \u201cI like your shoes, ma\u2019am.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d Peggy stopped so quickly that Tony almost smacked into her. \u201cI must have misheard you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am.\u201d Steve shook his head. \u201cI simply noticed you had new shoes, thought to comment on them.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou are about to undergo an extremely experimental, entirely life altering procedure, and you wanted to take the time to talk about my <i>shoes</i>?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI would also like to take the time to ask how your day is.\u201d Steve straightened his lean frame, eyebrows raised invitingly. \u201cOr if you had done anything interesting.\u201d </p><p>Peggy narrowed her eyes at him, and Tony made an impressed noise when Steve didn\u2019t so much as flinch, keeping the same open expression and easy smile. </p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she began slowly. \u201cI am very tense today as you can imagine, since my particular branch of the armed forces is responsible for everything that happens in the next few hours. I spent a short and yet rather informative drive sitting across from a the most stubborn soldier I\u2019ve ever met\u2013\u201d her gaze met his meaningfully, and then flicked to Tony. \u201c\u2013and his consistently overdressed friend, so <i>yes</i>, you could say I\u2019ve had an interesting day so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Steve cleared his throat. \u201cAnd\u2013and your shoes?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMy shoes are new.\u201d Peggy gave him a brief smile. \u201cVery sweet of you to notice, also very <i>surprising </i>that you noticed.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIf I can be bold?\u201d Steve cleared his throat.\u00a0\u201cI notice just about everything about you, Agent Carter.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Peggy\u2019s eyes flickered, her hand going to her hair to adjust a curl that didn\u2019t need to be adjusted at all, and Tony hid his smile.\u00a0<br></p><p>Seems like Aunt Peggy had developed that little nervous tic of hers <i>decades </i>before Tony picked up on it.</p><p>\u201cRight, well gentlemen, we are going to be late if we dilly dally and longer. Shall we?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cRight. Right of course.\u201d Steve started walking again when Peggy did, and when he looked back again, Tony shot him a thumbs up and an exaggerated wink. </p><p>Rhodey\u2019s advice was fool proof.<i> Get\u00a0\u2018em Cap.</i></p><p>Bolstered by the positive response from Peggy, Steve was just opening his mouth to say something else that maybe slightly resembled flirting, but Peggy pushed through a huge set of double doors and suddenly they were in a lab big enough to even bring <i>Tony </i>to a surprised halt. </p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019ll be a son of a bit\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cAh- ah. Language Mr. Carbonell.\u201d Peggy said at the same time Steve said, \u201cTony! <i>Language</i>!\u201d </p><p>Tony looked between the two of them with an amused smile, and Peggy tinged the slightest bit pink when Steve grinned at her. \u201cImagine that, I\u2019m friends with <i>two </i>people who don\u2019t approve of my language.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI wonder how many other things we have in common, Agent Carter.\u201d Steve added, closing one blue eyes in a rather bold wink. </p><p>\u201cWell then.\u201d Peggy cleared her throat and touched her hair again. \u201cThey are waiting for you down below, Rogers. Mr. Carbonell, you are welcome to come down to the floor with us, but please maintain a respectful distance. It is very kind of you to accompany Mr. Rogers for emotional support, but I still can\u2019t have you down on the floor and in the way, so say your goodbye now?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Tony stepped back and Steve moved with him, standing close enough that Tony could grab his hand. \u201cGo on and meet your destiny, blondie. This is going be amazing.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThanks for coming with me.\u201d Steve muttered, tightening his hold on Tony\u2019s fingers.\u00a0\u201cMeans a lot.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even worry about it. I\u2019ll be here when everything is over too, alright?\u201d Over Steve\u2019s head, Peggy was tapping her foot a little impatiently and Tony nodded that he saw.\u00a0\u201cYou have to go though, here comes Dr. Erskine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, Tony\u2014\u201c Steve looked a little panicked, but he didn\u2019t have time to finish his thought as Dr Erskine came up to shake his hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d Tony mouthed and flashed Steve a double thumbs up. \u201cYou got it, Steve. You got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm\u2013\u201d Steve kept looking back over his shoulder as Dr. Erskine led him onto the platform, and Tony was struck all over again by how vulnerable this Steve was, and how well he hid it behind that stubborn jaw. </p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d he repeated quietly, and tried to smile, relieved when Steve finally smiled back at him. </p><p>\u201cSheesh, someone get that kid a sandwich.\u201d Someone muttered behind Tony, and he turned around to snark back but stopped mid motion when he saw Steve climb up onto the table, looking paler, skinnier without his shirt, and the <i>enormity </i>of the situation hit him all at once.</p><p>Tony <i>knew </i>the serum worked of course, he knew that it was painful and that they had blacked out half of Brooklyn with the surge, and that Steve fell out of that chamber a shocking six foot two and two hundred plus pounds of All American beefcake.</p><p>Tony knew <i>all </i>of that. </p><p>But that knowledge didn\u2019t stop him from leaning over the rail and watching closely, straining to see every emotion that crossed Steve\u2019s face, the tiny twitches and the way his breathing picked up, fidgeting with his fingers, starting to bit at his bottom lip and then stopping himself. </p><p><i>Captain America is scared to death. </i></p><p>\u201cCan I go down there with him?\u201d Tony blurted before he could stop himself. \u201cAgent Carter, can I go down there with him? He shouldn\u2019t be alone right now, look at him! He needs someone there with him!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMr. Carbonell, if they kicked me off the operating room floor, I have very little doubt they will demand you leave as well.\u201d Peggy\u2019s voice was regretful.\u00a0\u201cI wish i could stand next to him too, but this is something he has to do alone.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Tony cursed under his breath.\u00a0\u201c<i>Right</i>.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt is good of you to want to be there for your friend, though.\u201d she added after a few seconds. \u201cHow long have you two known each other?\u201d </p><p>\u201c\u2026years.\u201d Tony answered quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve known him for <i>years </i>but it\u2019s only been the last little while that we\u2019ve gotten closer.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky to have each other.\u201d </p><p>\u201c\u2026yeah.\u201d he nodded slowly. \u201cYeah we are.\u201d </p><p>********************</p><p>********************</p><p>\u201cAre you comfortable?\u201d Dr. Erskine asked, touching the straps around Steve\u2019s midsection. \u201cI\u2019m afraid this is the tightest they go.\u201d </p><p>Steve licked his lips before answering, \u201cIt\u2019s a little big.\u201d When Dr. Erskine laughed, Steve added, \u201cDid you save me any of the schnapps?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot as much as I should have.\u201d the scientist patted his arm and chuckled again, and turned to start making a speech to the military personnel gathered in the room. </p><p>Steve tuned out most of it, the words only a buzz in his ears as he stared around at the bright lights and machinery that was powering up across from him. </p><p>Mr. Stark approached him, hooking leads up to his chest and Steve smiled a little thinking about how excited Bucky would have been to be meeting <i>Howard Stark</i> of all people, then frowned a few seconds later because he knew Bucky would hate this. </p><p>He would <i>hate </i>it. </p><p>Steve started trembling thinking about his best friend, his heart pounding as he thought first about how upset Bucky would be, and then how good it would be to go on to fight side by side with him. How good it would be to put on that uniform and run out side by side. It was all he wanted. All he had <i>ever </i>wanted and now it was so close he could almost\u2013</p><p>Howard glanced up from all the dials and levers in front of him to lay a reassuring hand on Steve\u2019s arm when his rising heart rate made the machine start beeping. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, soldier.\u201d he said with an easy wink. \u201cThe doc told me you were at the Expo? I can promise that this all works much better than my flying car.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI uh\u2013 I thought your car worked pretty well.\u201d Steve said lamely.\u00a0\u201cSure seemed like it would be alright, maybe.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Howard went back to adjusting the levers or dials or <i>whatever </i>it all was. \u201cYou must have seen a different demonstration, because I\u2019m pretty sure mine was terrible.\u201d He smiled and Steve couldn\u2019t help smiling back. \u201cYou have bigger things to worry about than flying cars though. I\u2019d like to say this is all roses, but it\u2019s going to give you a hell of a headache and probably growing pains so\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>Growing pains</i>?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUh yep.\u201d Howard studied Steve for a minute. \u201cI bet this little jolt in the ass will put almost a foot of height on you. More than a hundred pounds definitely. You\u2019ll be able to catch the eye of whoever you want.\u201d he cracked a grin that was so surprisingly <i>familiar </i>that all Steve could do was blink in surprise. \u201cMostly because you\u2019ll be too big for them to ignore, huh? Huh?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat was a terrible joke.\u201d Steve laughed and Howard shrugged it off.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, I make jokes whenever I\u2019m uncomfortable.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI know other people who do that.\u201d Steve squinted through the lights until he could make out Peggy standing straight and tall at the top of the stairs, and then he looked next to here to what was definitely Tony, fedora sat at a ridiculous angle, leaning over the railing and staring down at Steve. </p><p><i>Huh</i>.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Dr. Erskine was back, and Steve forced his eyes back to the doctor.</p><p>\u201cIs it too late to go to the bathroom?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re ready.\u201d Erskine smiled once more at Steve and then motioned to Mr. Stark. \u201cShall we?\u201d </p><p>*******************</p><p>*******************</p><p>From the stories, Tony had thought it would take <i>ages</i>. </p><p>Howard always talked about this part as if it had dragged on for days\u2013 the machines powering up, the brightening light, the way Steve screamed and then refused to let them shut it down even though everyone was scrambling to pull the plug. Howard shouting the percentages, Peggy with both hands over her mouth, the gathered generals and senators murmuring uncertainly. The heart stopping moment where everything hit a <i>hundred </i>and then started winding down, the pod opening with a hiss and Steve nearly falling out of it, staggering on his new legs and dragging in deep breaths. </p><p>Howard had always talked about it as if it had dragged on for days, but it was over in a matter of minutes, and Tony didn\u2019t take his eyes off the pod once.</p><p>Everyone was talking, shouting in surprise and amazement when Steve straightened to his newly impressive height. Peggy pushed her way through the crowd to get up close and personal with Steve and Tony wanted to laugh when he saw her reach out to touch a more than defined pec, pulling her hand away at the last minute and touching her hair nervously. </p><p>Steve was grinning, staring down at himself, looking around at all the people he was suddenly towering over, finally looking up and meeting Tony\u2019s eyes across the space. </p><p>Tony offered a wave and a little smile, hoping Steve\u2019s vision hadn\u2019t sharpened enough to see the sadness he couldn\u2019t quite hide. </p><p>Howard had always talked about it as if it had dragged on for days, but it had been barely one breath to the next, and the Steve Tony had just barely gotten to know was was gone, Captain America standing in his place. </p><p>It all happened so much faster than Howard had said. </p><p>Everything else happened in record time, though. </p><p>Tony was just starting to walk down the stairs when the explosion rocked the lab and people started screaming. </p><p>Too caught up in the moment, Tony had forgotten about this, had forgotten about the HYDRA agent that had been in the same room.\u00a0</p><p>The bomb knocked threw him into the wall, and Tony was just getting to his feet again, palms scraped, nose bleeding, when gun shots sounded and the agent came running up the stairs past him.\u00a0</p><p>Tony reached out to stop him, grabbed onto the a trouser leg to try and slow him down, but a swift kick to his ribs had him rolling further down the stairs, wheezing and holding on to his sides. </p><p>Peggy and Steve went flying past him just like they were supposed to, Peggy with her gun already drawn, Steve stumbling over his feet as he tried to get used to his new height, and when he skittered to a stop to try and check on Tony, Tony only waved him on. </p><p>He was fine. He knew Steve had to get out the door and after that HYDRA agent because waiting even a <i>minute </i>would mean that Steve would be too late to swim after the submarine, and the man would escape, and it would ruin everything.\u00a0</p><p>History couldn\u2019t stop, not even for Tony\u2019s most likely broken ribs. </p><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Tony\u2019s eyes shot open wide when Howard leaned over to offer him a hand up. \u201cThat was quite a fall you took. You dead, dying or-\u201d </p><p>\u201c\u2013bleeding.\u201d Tony interrupted, pulling his hand from his nose to show Howard the blood. \u201cNo. Not dead or dying, but I am bleeding so\u2013\u201d</p><p>Howard stared at him in confusion, and Tony realized belatedly that he had finished his dad\u2019s sentence, and that that was <i>weird</i>.</p><p>\u201cAh, sorry. My dad always said the same thing to me.\u201d Wow it was\u2026 <i>different</i>\u2026to lie to his dad and not really be lying at all.\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to interrupt you.\u201d</p><p>Time travel. <i>Sheesh</i>. </p><p>\u201cCivilian, huh?\u201d Howard pulled Tony to his feet, trying not to jostle his ribs. \u201cHow did you manage to be invited to this sort of thing? This is supposed to be military brass and Capitol Hill employees only.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Agent Carter\u2019s driver.\u201d Tony said blandly and Howard\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cAnd um, Steve\u2019s friend?\u201d Another unimpressed look. \u201cAlso, I know a lot about this sort of thing.\u201d he motioned around the room. \u201cSo. Several reasons to be here.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou know a lot about this sort of thing?\u201d Howard repeated. \u201c<i>Really</i>? Because I built these machines by hand. The blueprints don\u2019t even exist outside of my head. What exactly do you think you know about this sort of thing?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>And there it was\u2013 that condescending, caustic tone that Howard had perfected by the time Tony was old enough to argue with him. A mocking, usually rhetorical question delivered with a cutting smile and a faux interested expression.\u00a0</p><p>Fortunately, or maybe unfortunately, Tony wasn\u2019t a ten year old kid looking for his dad\u2019s approval anymore, so he stared Howard down for a long minute before cocking his head and turning to look over at the only machine still running in the nearly destroyed lab.\u00a0</p><p>All the needles in the displays were edging towards red as the huge server began to overheat, a terrible whining noise coming from the overworked fans as they ran non stop trying to force the machine to cool before things started melting or possibly exploding.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat do I know about this sort of thing?\u201d Tony repeated and limped over to the machine, dropping to his knees and rolling onto his back before scooting underneath it.\u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t mind if I fix this do you? Nah, you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing!\u201d Howard cried.\u00a0\u201cThat machine is worth more than your\u2013\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShush.\u201d Tony held a finger out and crawled deeper beneath it, groaning as his ribs pulled.\u00a0\u201cGive me a sec. I\u2019m not used to such low tech but I should be able to\u2013\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLOW TECH! I\u2019ll have you know\u2013!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Shush</i>!\u201d Tony said louder, and with a little maneuvering, managed to separate the wires that were crossed beneath the baseboard, rerouting one of them into a different server, shocking himself terribly, but grinning when the machine finally fell silent, the fans slowing to a more manageable pace as the unit started regulating its own temperature again. </p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d A pained grunt as he stood back up and fixed Howard with a smug look. \u201cNow at least that annoying noise isn\u2019t happening anymore.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2013I\u2013\u201d Howard was speechless, and Tony was about as happy as he had ever been, finally getting a chance to show his father up. \u201cUm, what did you say you did again?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAgent Carter\u2019s driver.\u201d Tony supplied. \u201cBut I dabble in mechanics too. More of a hobby than anything.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d Howard narrowed his eyes and Tony straightened under the suspicious gaze, waiting for the accusations of spying in Howard\u2019s work, of cutting corners, for there to be no way that Tony knew how to do that, so he must be cheating\u2013</p><p>\u201cSmart ass.\u201d Howard finally said, and when Tony only blinked at him, Howard laughed. \u201cI like it. Seems to me like your wasted driving Agent. Carter around but hey, I\u2019d do it if it gave me a chance to be close to her too.\u201d </p><p>\u201cUh\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, while they are tracking down Nazi\u2019s\u2013\u201d Howard motioned out the door to where Peggy and Steve had chased the HYDRA agent. \u201cAnd they are\u2026mourning.\u201d a flicker of sadness as he looked over to where Dr. Erskine was lying covered in a sheet. \u201cI have machinery to fix. Do you want to help, or do you have something else going on?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Tony shook his head, already rolling up his sleeves. \u201cLet\u2019s fix some things.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Howard grinned and Tony grinned right back, his heart aching a little seeing a smile that he had <i>rarely </i>seen growing up. \u201cThis isn\u2019t too low tech for you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll manage.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell, grab a wrench, then.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>*******************</p><p>*******************</p><p>That night, Tony found Steve standing on the balcony of his hotel room, staring out across the city with a forlorn expression, his arms folded tight across his chest. </p><p>\u201cSteve.\u201d Tony reached up\u2013 <i>ugh</i>, he hated that\u2013 to put a hand on Steve\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about Dr. Erskine.\u201d </p><p>Steve didn\u2019t answer, and Tony joined him at the rail. \u201cHow are you feeling? Any weird side effects?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a headache for about three minutes.\u201d he said shortly. \u201cLegs hurt. Arms hurt from growing so much.\u201d he dragged in a deep breath. \u201cRibs don\u2019t hurt though. Feel like I can breathe for the first time in my life. Heartbeats steady. It\u2019s nice.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026good.\u201d Tony murmured, and fell silent, waiting for Steve to say whatever else was on his mind. </p><p>It took a full ten minutes of silence between them but Steve finally said, \u201cThey want me to go on tour with a USO show. Encourage people to buy bonds and volunteer for the cause and all that. Say that a big guy like me in a red white and blue outfit would be the perfect patriotic symbol.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlright?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThey gave me a promotion.\u201d Steve continued. \u201c<i>Captain America</i> they want to call me. Yesterday I was plain old Steve Rogers, now I\u2019m a <i>Captain</i>. Bucky would be so proud.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSteve\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to be a <i>soldier</i>, Tony. I went through with this whole thing so I could go and fight Nazi\u2019s, so I could save people, and now I\u2019ll be the equivalent of a circus animal. Dressed up, trotted out, paraded around for money while pretty girls sing. It\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s humiliating.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSteve\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cI should have stayed home and collected scrap metal.\u201d He said bitterly. \u201cWould be making just as much of a difference huh? Dr. Erskine died for this, for <i>me</i>, and I can\u2019t even live up to what he expected from me. He said I was special, said I was good, that the serum would amplify all of that but\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou <i>are </i>special, Steve.\u201d Tony started helplessly. \u201cI mean, you are\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cEverything special about me came out of a test tube!\u201d Steve shouted, and Tony backed up a step in surprise, his hand going to his chest as it started hurting, remembering another conversation between the two of them that had gone much the same way. </p><p>Except <i>Tony </i>had been saying those words, and had been too angry to register the hurt in Steve\u2019s eyes\u2013 the hurt he could see so plainly right now.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing special about me.\u201d Steve repeated. \u201cSure, I can lift a motorcycle now. I can run faster than most cars, I can\u2013 I mean, I caught a <i>submarine </i>Tony. Caught it and ripped the top off. Last week I couldn\u2019t make it up the stairs to our apartment without coughing. Today, I jumped an eight foot fence without blinking. But it\u2019s all the serum. And even <i>with </i>the serum I\u2019m still someone that can\u2019t go to war, someone who is being told he can\u2019t fight, someone who isn\u2019t good enough.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not good enough, Tony.\u201d He was whispering now, big shoulders slumped in resignation. \u201cEven after all this. I\u2019m <i>still not good enough</i>.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2013\u201d Tony didn\u2019t know what to say, didn\u2019t even know where to start. \u201cUm, Steve\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow did you like Howard?\u201d Steve changed the subject and Tony blinked a few times in surprise. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a prick.\u201d he said slowly. \u201cBut brilliant. Probably a good guy to keep around. Why do you ask?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think Peggy likes him.\u201d Steve made a fist, staring down at his hand. \u201cThey do this weird thing where they look at each other and don\u2019t say anything and then smile and I don\u2019t know what to do with that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fairly certain Peggy has no interest in Mr. Stark.\u201d Tony denied instantly, shuddering over the thought of his aunt and his father hooking up. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter anyway.\u201d Steve pushed away from the railing, moving back into his room. \u201cShe\u2019s going to go off to war, and I\u2019m going to head to a stage with a line of dancing girls. No sense pining over someone I can\u2019t have.\u201d </p><p>He slumped onto the bed, and after a few seconds of hesitation, Tony climbed right onto the bed next to him, close enough that their shoulders bumped. </p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be all bad.\u201d he said carefully and Steve closed his eyes with a muffled groan. \u201cNo, I\u2019m serious.\u201d Tony nudged him playfully. \u201cI mean, with that new booty, you will look <i>great </i>in tights.\u201d </p><p>A long, tense moment, and Steve finally started to smile, then he was chuckling and when Tony started grinning, it turned into full fledged laughter until both of them were gasping for breath wiping tears from their eyes. </p><p>\u201cTony\u2013 Tony this has been the craziest day of my life.\u201d Steve admitted, reaching for a glass of water. \u201cWho I was this morning and who I am now, everything that\u2019s happened\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the same person tonight that you were this morning.\u201d Tony said firmly. \u201cJust you know, taller.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo am I a <i>snack </i>now, Tony?\u201d </p><p>\u201cA whole damn <i>meal</i>, Captain America.\u201d Tony shoved at him. \u201cJust be careful, there\u2019s a whole world of women out there who would love to experience that meal first hand. </p><p>\u201cOh good Christ, don\u2019t call me Captain America.\u201d Steve slid further down in the sheets, closing his eyes and yawning loudly. \u201cThat sounds awful. I hate that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI bet you\u2019ll learn to like it.\u201d Tony started to get off the bed. \u201cAnd don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t notice that you didn\u2019t comment on how terrible it will be to have all those pretty women trying to take a bite out of you. I\u2019m on to you Rogers.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything, Tony.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI know more than you think, Spangles. Like that your giant ass needs to sleep.\u201d Tony flipped a few lights off. \u201cI hear show business is a demanding life, all the make up and the glitter and the costumes and the\u2013\u201d</p><p>A pillow was winged at him and Tony <i>acked</i>! as he went down beneath it. </p><p>\u201cOh shit!\u201d Steve leapt from the bed and helped Tony back up. \u201cSorry about that, Tony, I forgot to check my strength. Still getting used to it all. Didn\u2019t mean to flatten you like that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Captain America</i>.\u201d Tony huffed and grabbed his hat off the ground. \u201cYou are setting a terrible example for children across the country by starting unprovoked pillow fights with civilians. <i>Honestly</i>.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Completely unrepentant, Steve only grinned before flopping back on the bed. \u201cGood night, Tony.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGood night, Steve.\u201d </p><p>Tony closed the door and crossed the room to the one that had been provided for him by Steve\u2019s new boss, Senator Brandt. </p><p>It hadn\u2019t taken much convincing at all to encourage the Senator that Tony was Steve\u2019s manager, the one to be handling his finances because the Senator wouldn\u2019t <i>dream </i>of using Steve as an employee of the United States, putting him through all the physical strain of performing and traveling without cutting him a paycheck, wasn\u2019t that right? Steve was patriotic, but <i>no one</i> was that patriotic. </p><p>The Senator had smiled a wonderfully fake smile, shaken Tony\u2019s hand and proclaimed him part of the project and now here they were, set for a rehearsal by the end of the week, a first show by the end of next. </p><p>The Star Spangled Man with a Plan was about to take America by storm, inspire comics and cartoons and movies and all of that sort of thing, and Tony was going to be right next to him for it all. </p><p>Tony checked the date on the calender on the wall, his hand a bit unsteady as he touched the page. </p><p>Steve was Captain America now, which was the first big step to start everything else off.\u00a0</p><p>It was only a matter of time before they ended up over seas, performing for the 107th, finding Bucky, <i>losing </i>Bucky\u2014</p><p>It was only a matter of time, and as Tony stretched out on the hotel bed, he stared up at the ceiling and started counting down the days until the end.</p><p>**********************</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnC55Xt5xdhEUuVPTO0Orvw\">@bornwithgasolineheart</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\"

Don\u2019t be so clingy.\u201d<b><br></b></p><p>\u201cBut it will be a few more weeks before he actually gets the letter, so by the time he reads it, he will have been gone two months, now won\u2019t he?\u201d Tony pushed Steve further away. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not\u2026 <i>clingy</i>. He <i>asked </i>me to write to him. Very nicely I might add. How could I say no?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe asked you to\u2013\u201d Steve shook his head. \u201cHe <i>asked </i>you to write to him? Like you\u2019re his girl or something?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fairly certain Bucky knows I\u2019m not a <i>girl</i>.\u201d Tony deadpanned. \u201cBut he asked me to be his fella, yeah. I have to admit, no one has ever asked me out quite like that before. It was\u2026 charming.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCharming.\u201d Steve sat back in the seat, thin arms folded. \u201cAnd you said\u2026 yes. To being Bucky\u2019s fella.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, I did.\u201d Tony signed the short letter with a quick flourish. \u201cHave you ever had that guy ask you anything? One look at those baby blues and I\u2019d give him a new car.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony paused, fully expecting Steve to laugh, but the blonde stayed silent. \u201cUm, should I have asked you for you blessing first?\u201d he asked curiously. \u201cYou\u2019re sort of scowling at me like I\u2019m sneaking around with your sister when she\u2019s supposed to be at the convent.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAm not.\u201d Steve scrunched his nose in irritation. \u201cI got no problem with it. You two wanna be together, then\u2013\u201d\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, really, you\u2019re looking at me like I\u2019m trying to get under Sister Margaret\u2019s habit.\u201d Tony stuffed the letter into an envelope and turned back to Steve. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you? I thought you didn\u2019t have a problem with me and Bucky?\u201d\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a problem.\u201d Steve insisted. \u201cI was just\u2013 I was just wondering. Is it always that easy?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIs <i>what </i>always that easy?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat you and Bucky have!\u201d Steve\u2019s voice rose a little and Tony frowned at him in confusion. \u201cYou make it look so easy! Is it always like that? You know, you meet someone, think they\u2019re real fine lookin\u2019? Flirt a little, fall into bed and then you\u2019re in love? Is it that easy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2013\u201d Tony cleared his throat. \u201cUh, Steve, Bucky and I aren\u2019t\u2013I mean, I don\u2019t think we are\u2013Um\u2013 I mean, yeah its worked out really well for us since we only knew each other a week, but I wouldn\u2019t say we are\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t seem fair is all.\u201d A disappointed shrug, Steve not even listening to Tony\u2019s stammered speech. \u201cBucky don\u2019t even like girls, has to hide who he is all the time cos people kinda hate people like him, and he <i>still </i>finds love before me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh. That\u2013 that wasn\u2019t what I was expecting you to say.\u201d Tony looked a little closer at Steve, noting the tired lines around his eyes, the weariness in the sloop of his shoulder. \u201cSteve, are you\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you help me talk to Agent Carter?\u201d Steve interrupted. \u201cShe\u2019s so pretty, and I like her alot and today\u2019s going to be the first time I\u2019m spending time with her alone, and I\u2019m nervous about it. You have any advice?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou want my advice on how to talk to Agent Carter.\u201d Tony repeated, covering his mouth with his hand so Steve wouldn\u2019t know he wanted to laugh. \u201cWhat makes you think I know how to talk to girls? All you\u2019ve seen is me flirt with Bucky and honestly, it hasn\u2019t been that smooth. I know you think its been easy, but considering\u2013\u201d Tony closed his eyes briefly, thinking about how close to a mental breakdown he\u2019d been the first few days.\u00a0\u201cConsidering everything that has been going on, its fairly amazing anything happened at all between me and Bucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you love him.\u201d Steve said matter of factly.\u00a0\u201cSo obviously something is right about you two.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2013\u201d Tony started to deny that he loved Bucky, but Steve looked so sure about it all, that the words sort of died on his tongue.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re right. There is something\u2026 <i>right </i>about Bucky and I.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something right about Agent Carter too.\u201d Steve said wistfully.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know what it is, Tony. We\u2019ve only talked a handful of times, but I want to know her. Can you help me with that?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re doing just fine with her by yourself.\u201d Tony patted his shoulder.\u00a0\u201cShe likes you, Steve, trust me.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to call you a liar, Tony, but\u2013\u201d Steve motioned down his body.\u00a0\u201cI need all the help I can get, and that means more than my friend reassuring me, you know?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Tony jumped to his feet and motioned for Steve to stand up too. \u201cI\u2019m going to give you the same advice my Honeybear\u2013\u201d a blank look, and Tony explained, \u201c\u2013my best friend. I\u2019m going to give you the same advice my best friend gave me when I started dating.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Steve stood up slowly, wiping his hands down his slacks. \u201cWas it good advice?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUm\u2026\u201d Tony pursed his lips. \u201cUm, okay so the thing about my Honeybear is that he <i>thinks </i>he has great advice, and maybe it <i>is </i>great advice when you\u2019re as good looking as he is, but for those of us that have to work at being cute\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou sweet on your\u2026 honeybear\u2026 too?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony stopped in surprise and Steve raised his eyebrows in question. \u201cOh, because I called him good looking?\u201d A quick shake of his head. \u201cUh no, not sweet on him. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Rhodey is a snack but\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cA <i>what</i>?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting off topic.\u201d Tony grinned and cleared his throat. \u201cAlright, Steve, the first dating advice Rhodey ever gave me was exactly this:: Stand up straight, <i>never </i>ask how they are doing, <i>always </i>compliment their shoes.\u201d </p><p>\u201cStand up straight.\u201d Steve squared his shoulders, tilting his chin up. \u201cNever ask how they are \u2013 Wait, why wouldn\u2019t I ask how Agent Carter is doing? That\u2019s just being polite, what\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBecause <i>you </i>might think you are just asking how she\u2019s doing.\u201d Tony fussed with Steve\u2019s tie. \u201cBut you come out sounding like a total Joey.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand that reference.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t.\u201d Tony backed up a few steps, folded his arms over his chest, looked Steve over from top to toe, and then smirked and asked, \u201cHow <i>you </i>doing?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d Steve scowled at him. \u201cThat is <i>awful</i>, why would you say it like that? Why do you sound so\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cCreepy?\u201d Tony finished.\u00a0\u201cYep, it sounds <i>creepy</i>, that\u2019s why we don\u2019t ask how she is doing. Instead, you could smile and ask how her day is going. It lets her know that you are interested in her activities, but also is a generic enough question that she can reply <i>fine </i>and leave without being rude. If she wants to keep talking to you, she can. If she doesn\u2019t want to, she isn\u2019t trapped into a conversation that she feels obligated to continue, you know?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fair.\u201d Steve nodded thoughtfully. \u201cSo I ask her how her days is going, and then I compliment her shoes?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy her shoes?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBecause if you\u2019re going to check her out, you should at least say something nice and every woman likes to talk about her shoes.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTony, I\u2019m not going to check her\u2013\u201d </p><p>Tony just <i>looked </i>at him, and Steve sighed and looked away. </p><p>\u201cYep, that\u2019s what I thought. Stand up straight, ask how her day is, say something nice about her shoes. Fool proof.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah? It\u2019s worked for you the first time?\u201d Steve reached for his khaki shirt, buttoning it up before tucking his tie in. \u201cFool proof?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt worked like a champ.\u201d Tony promised, running his fingers over the pleats in Steve\u2019s hat before handing it over. \u201cRight up until my date for the evening realized I was too young to buy her a drink, and then I struck out <i>spectacularly</i>, but you don\u2019t have to worry about either of those things because you are old enough to buy Agent Carter a beer, <i>and </i>she already likes you.\u201d </p><p>He leaned away to look over Steve\u2019s outfit critically. \u201cAnd after they give you this top secret serum, you\u2019ll be a snack too so\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cA <i>snack</i>?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Tony grinned and clapped a hand on Steve\u2019s shoulder. \u201cEveryone in the room will want to take a bite out of you.\u201d </p><p>\u201c\u2026.thanks?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou are very welcome.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>**********************</p><p>**********************</p><p>\u201cRemind me again why it was necessary for Mr. Carbonell to join us on our little expedition?\u201d Peggy asked as she marched down the long hallway, Steve almost jogging to catch up, Tony trailing a step behind, fully content to smirk at the back of his friends head. </p><p>\u201cTony is one of my best friends.\u201d Steve shot Tony a look over his shoulder. \u201cAnd I thought I was allowed someone in there with me for support.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI thought you would bring a priest.\u201d Peggy took a file from someone and signed her name quickly before handing it back, never missing a step. \u201cOr your <i>bookie</i>. Not my driver. I wasn\u2019t even aware the two of you were friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently best friends.\u201d Tony said with a pleased grin.\u00a0\u201cAnd I am happy to pray over Steve if he needs it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t need prayers, Tony, thank you. And also, I don\u2019t gamble, ma\u2019am.\u201d Steve was quick to assure Peggy, and with another uncertain glance back at Tony, he added, \u201cI like your shoes, ma\u2019am.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d Peggy stopped so quickly that Tony almost smacked into her. \u201cI must have misheard you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am.\u201d Steve shook his head. \u201cI simply noticed you had new shoes, thought to comment on them.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou are about to undergo an extremely experimental, entirely life altering procedure, and you wanted to take the time to talk about my <i>shoes</i>?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI would also like to take the time to ask how your day is.\u201d Steve straightened his lean frame, eyebrows raised invitingly. \u201cOr if you had done anything interesting.\u201d </p><p>Peggy narrowed her eyes at him, and Tony made an impressed noise when Steve didn\u2019t so much as flinch, keeping the same open expression and easy smile. </p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she began slowly. \u201cI am very tense today as you can imagine, since my particular branch of the armed forces is responsible for everything that happens in the next few hours. I spent a short and yet rather informative drive sitting across from a the most stubborn soldier I\u2019ve ever met\u2013\u201d her gaze met his meaningfully, and then flicked to Tony. \u201c\u2013and his consistently overdressed friend, so <i>yes</i>, you could say I\u2019ve had an interesting day so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Steve cleared his throat. \u201cAnd\u2013and your shoes?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMy shoes are new.\u201d Peggy gave him a brief smile. \u201cVery sweet of you to notice, also very <i>surprising </i>that you noticed.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIf I can be bold?\u201d Steve cleared his throat.\u00a0\u201cI notice just about everything about you, Agent Carter.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Peggy\u2019s eyes flickered, her hand going to her hair to adjust a curl that didn\u2019t need to be adjusted at all, and Tony hid his smile.\u00a0<br></p><p>Seems like Aunt Peggy had developed that little nervous tic of hers <i>decades </i>before Tony picked up on it.</p><p>\u201cRight, well gentlemen, we are going to be late if we dilly dally and longer. Shall we?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cRight. Right of course.\u201d Steve started walking again when Peggy did, and when he looked back again, Tony shot him a thumbs up and an exaggerated wink. </p><p>Rhodey\u2019s advice was fool proof.<i> Get\u00a0\u2018em Cap.</i></p><p>Bolstered by the positive response from Peggy, Steve was just opening his mouth to say something else that maybe slightly resembled flirting, but Peggy pushed through a huge set of double doors and suddenly they were in a lab big enough to even bring <i>Tony </i>to a surprised halt. </p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019ll be a son of a bit\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cAh- ah. Language Mr. Carbonell.\u201d Peggy said at the same time Steve said, \u201cTony! <i>Language</i>!\u201d </p><p>Tony looked between the two of them with an amused smile, and Peggy tinged the slightest bit pink when Steve grinned at her. \u201cImagine that, I\u2019m friends with <i>two </i>people who don\u2019t approve of my language.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI wonder how many other things we have in common, Agent Carter.\u201d Steve added, closing one blue eyes in a rather bold wink. </p><p>\u201cWell then.\u201d Peggy cleared her throat and touched her hair again. \u201cThey are waiting for you down below, Rogers. Mr. Carbonell, you are welcome to come down to the floor with us, but please maintain a respectful distance. It is very kind of you to accompany Mr. Rogers for emotional support, but I still can\u2019t have you down on the floor and in the way, so say your goodbye now?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Tony stepped back and Steve moved with him, standing close enough that Tony could grab his hand. \u201cGo on and meet your destiny, blondie. This is going be amazing.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThanks for coming with me.\u201d Steve muttered, tightening his hold on Tony\u2019s fingers.\u00a0\u201cMeans a lot.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even worry about it. I\u2019ll be here when everything is over too, alright?\u201d Over Steve\u2019s head, Peggy was tapping her foot a little impatiently and Tony nodded that he saw.\u00a0\u201cYou have to go though, here comes Dr. Erskine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, Tony\u2014\u201c Steve looked a little panicked, but he didn\u2019t have time to finish his thought as Dr Erskine came up to shake his hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d Tony mouthed and flashed Steve a double thumbs up. \u201cYou got it, Steve. You got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm\u2013\u201d Steve kept looking back over his shoulder as Dr. Erskine led him onto the platform, and Tony was struck all over again by how vulnerable this Steve was, and how well he hid it behind that stubborn jaw. </p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d he repeated quietly, and tried to smile, relieved when Steve finally smiled back at him. </p><p>\u201cSheesh, someone get that kid a sandwich.\u201d Someone muttered behind Tony, and he turned around to snark back but stopped mid motion when he saw Steve climb up onto the table, looking paler, skinnier without his shirt, and the <i>enormity </i>of the situation hit him all at once.</p><p>Tony <i>knew </i>the serum worked of course, he knew that it was painful and that they had blacked out half of Brooklyn with the surge, and that Steve fell out of that chamber a shocking six foot two and two hundred plus pounds of All American beefcake.</p><p>Tony knew <i>all </i>of that. </p><p>But that knowledge didn\u2019t stop him from leaning over the rail and watching closely, straining to see every emotion that crossed Steve\u2019s face, the tiny twitches and the way his breathing picked up, fidgeting with his fingers, starting to bit at his bottom lip and then stopping himself. </p><p><i>Captain America is scared to death. </i></p><p>\u201cCan I go down there with him?\u201d Tony blurted before he could stop himself. \u201cAgent Carter, can I go down there with him? He shouldn\u2019t be alone right now, look at him! He needs someone there with him!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMr. Carbonell, if they kicked me off the operating room floor, I have very little doubt they will demand you leave as well.\u201d Peggy\u2019s voice was regretful.\u00a0\u201cI wish i could stand next to him too, but this is something he has to do alone.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Tony cursed under his breath.\u00a0\u201c<i>Right</i>.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt is good of you to want to be there for your friend, though.\u201d she added after a few seconds. \u201cHow long have you two known each other?\u201d </p><p>\u201c\u2026years.\u201d Tony answered quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve known him for <i>years </i>but it\u2019s only been the last little while that we\u2019ve gotten closer.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky to have each other.\u201d </p><p>\u201c\u2026yeah.\u201d he nodded slowly. \u201cYeah we are.\u201d </p><p>********************</p><p>********************</p><p>\u201cAre you comfortable?\u201d Dr. Erskine asked, touching the straps around Steve\u2019s midsection. \u201cI\u2019m afraid this is the tightest they go.\u201d </p><p>Steve licked his lips before answering, \u201cIt\u2019s a little big.\u201d When Dr. Erskine laughed, Steve added, \u201cDid you save me any of the schnapps?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot as much as I should have.\u201d the scientist patted his arm and chuckled again, and turned to start making a speech to the military personnel gathered in the room. </p><p>Steve tuned out most of it, the words only a buzz in his ears as he stared around at the bright lights and machinery that was powering up across from him. </p><p>Mr. Stark approached him, hooking leads up to his chest and Steve smiled a little thinking about how excited Bucky would have been to be meeting <i>Howard Stark</i> of all people, then frowned a few seconds later because he knew Bucky would hate this. </p><p>He would <i>hate </i>it. </p><p>Steve started trembling thinking about his best friend, his heart pounding as he thought first about how upset Bucky would be, and then how good it would be to go on to fight side by side with him. How good it would be to put on that uniform and run out side by side. It was all he wanted. All he had <i>ever </i>wanted and now it was so close he could almost\u2013</p><p>Howard glanced up from all the dials and levers in front of him to lay a reassuring hand on Steve\u2019s arm when his rising heart rate made the machine start beeping. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, soldier.\u201d he said with an easy wink. \u201cThe doc told me you were at the Expo? I can promise that this all works much better than my flying car.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI uh\u2013 I thought your car worked pretty well.\u201d Steve said lamely.\u00a0\u201cSure seemed like it would be alright, maybe.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Howard went back to adjusting the levers or dials or <i>whatever </i>it all was. \u201cYou must have seen a different demonstration, because I\u2019m pretty sure mine was terrible.\u201d He smiled and Steve couldn\u2019t help smiling back. \u201cYou have bigger things to worry about than flying cars though. I\u2019d like to say this is all roses, but it\u2019s going to give you a hell of a headache and probably growing pains so\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>Growing pains</i>?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUh yep.\u201d Howard studied Steve for a minute. \u201cI bet this little jolt in the ass will put almost a foot of height on you. More than a hundred pounds definitely. You\u2019ll be able to catch the eye of whoever you want.\u201d he cracked a grin that was so surprisingly <i>familiar </i>that all Steve could do was blink in surprise. \u201cMostly because you\u2019ll be too big for them to ignore, huh? Huh?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat was a terrible joke.\u201d Steve laughed and Howard shrugged it off.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, I make jokes whenever I\u2019m uncomfortable.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI know other people who do that.\u201d Steve squinted through the lights until he could make out Peggy standing straight and tall at the top of the stairs, and then he looked next to here to what was definitely Tony, fedora sat at a ridiculous angle, leaning over the railing and staring down at Steve. </p><p><i>Huh</i>.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Dr. Erskine was back, and Steve forced his eyes back to the doctor.</p><p>\u201cIs it too late to go to the bathroom?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re ready.\u201d Erskine smiled once more at Steve and then motioned to Mr. Stark. \u201cShall we?\u201d </p><p>*******************</p><p>*******************</p><p>From the stories, Tony had thought it would take <i>ages</i>. </p><p>Howard always talked about this part as if it had dragged on for days\u2013 the machines powering up, the brightening light, the way Steve screamed and then refused to let them shut it down even though everyone was scrambling to pull the plug. Howard shouting the percentages, Peggy with both hands over her mouth, the gathered generals and senators murmuring uncertainly. The heart stopping moment where everything hit a <i>hundred </i>and then started winding down, the pod opening with a hiss and Steve nearly falling out of it, staggering on his new legs and dragging in deep breaths. </p><p>Howard had always talked about it as if it had dragged on for days, but it was over in a matter of minutes, and Tony didn\u2019t take his eyes off the pod once.</p><p>Everyone was talking, shouting in surprise and amazement when Steve straightened to his newly impressive height. Peggy pushed her way through the crowd to get up close and personal with Steve and Tony wanted to laugh when he saw her reach out to touch a more than defined pec, pulling her hand away at the last minute and touching her hair nervously. </p><p>Steve was grinning, staring down at himself, looking around at all the people he was suddenly towering over, finally looking up and meeting Tony\u2019s eyes across the space. </p><p>Tony offered a wave and a little smile, hoping Steve\u2019s vision hadn\u2019t sharpened enough to see the sadness he couldn\u2019t quite hide. </p><p>Howard had always talked about it as if it had dragged on for days, but it had been barely one breath to the next, and the Steve Tony had just barely gotten to know was was gone, Captain America standing in his place. </p><p>It all happened so much faster than Howard had said. </p><p>Everything else happened in record time, though. </p><p>Tony was just starting to walk down the stairs when the explosion rocked the lab and people started screaming. </p><p>Too caught up in the moment, Tony had forgotten about this, had forgotten about the HYDRA agent that had been in the same room.\u00a0</p><p>The bomb knocked threw him into the wall, and Tony was just getting to his feet again, palms scraped, nose bleeding, when gun shots sounded and the agent came running up the stairs past him.\u00a0</p><p>Tony reached out to stop him, grabbed onto the a trouser leg to try and slow him down, but a swift kick to his ribs had him rolling further down the stairs, wheezing and holding on to his sides. </p><p>Peggy and Steve went flying past him just like they were supposed to, Peggy with her gun already drawn, Steve stumbling over his feet as he tried to get used to his new height, and when he skittered to a stop to try and check on Tony, Tony only waved him on. </p><p>He was fine. He knew Steve had to get out the door and after that HYDRA agent because waiting even a <i>minute </i>would mean that Steve would be too late to swim after the submarine, and the man would escape, and it would ruin everything.\u00a0</p><p>History couldn\u2019t stop, not even for Tony\u2019s most likely broken ribs. </p><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Tony\u2019s eyes shot open wide when Howard leaned over to offer him a hand up. \u201cThat was quite a fall you took. You dead, dying or-\u201d </p><p>\u201c\u2013bleeding.\u201d Tony interrupted, pulling his hand from his nose to show Howard the blood. \u201cNo. Not dead or dying, but I am bleeding so\u2013\u201d</p><p>Howard stared at him in confusion, and Tony realized belatedly that he had finished his dad\u2019s sentence, and that that was <i>weird</i>.</p><p>\u201cAh, sorry. My dad always said the same thing to me.\u201d Wow it was\u2026 <i>different</i>\u2026to lie to his dad and not really be lying at all.\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to interrupt you.\u201d</p><p>Time travel. <i>Sheesh</i>. </p><p>\u201cCivilian, huh?\u201d Howard pulled Tony to his feet, trying not to jostle his ribs. \u201cHow did you manage to be invited to this sort of thing? This is supposed to be military brass and Capitol Hill employees only.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Agent Carter\u2019s driver.\u201d Tony said blandly and Howard\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cAnd um, Steve\u2019s friend?\u201d Another unimpressed look. \u201cAlso, I know a lot about this sort of thing.\u201d he motioned around the room. \u201cSo. Several reasons to be here.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou know a lot about this sort of thing?\u201d Howard repeated. \u201c<i>Really</i>? Because I built these machines by hand. The blueprints don\u2019t even exist outside of my head. What exactly do you think you know about this sort of thing?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>And there it was\u2013 that condescending, caustic tone that Howard had perfected by the time Tony was old enough to argue with him. A mocking, usually rhetorical question delivered with a cutting smile and a faux interested expression.\u00a0</p><p>Fortunately, or maybe unfortunately, Tony wasn\u2019t a ten year old kid looking for his dad\u2019s approval anymore, so he stared Howard down for a long minute before cocking his head and turning to look over at the only machine still running in the nearly destroyed lab.\u00a0</p><p>All the needles in the displays were edging towards red as the huge server began to overheat, a terrible whining noise coming from the overworked fans as they ran non stop trying to force the machine to cool before things started melting or possibly exploding.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat do I know about this sort of thing?\u201d Tony repeated and limped over to the machine, dropping to his knees and rolling onto his back before scooting underneath it.\u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t mind if I fix this do you? Nah, you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing!\u201d Howard cried.\u00a0\u201cThat machine is worth more than your\u2013\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShush.\u201d Tony held a finger out and crawled deeper beneath it, groaning as his ribs pulled.\u00a0\u201cGive me a sec. I\u2019m not used to such low tech but I should be able to\u2013\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLOW TECH! I\u2019ll have you know\u2013!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Shush</i>!\u201d Tony said louder, and with a little maneuvering, managed to separate the wires that were crossed beneath the baseboard, rerouting one of them into a different server, shocking himself terribly, but grinning when the machine finally fell silent, the fans slowing to a more manageable pace as the unit started regulating its own temperature again. </p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d A pained grunt as he stood back up and fixed Howard with a smug look. \u201cNow at least that annoying noise isn\u2019t happening anymore.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2013I\u2013\u201d Howard was speechless, and Tony was about as happy as he had ever been, finally getting a chance to show his father up. \u201cUm, what did you say you did again?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAgent Carter\u2019s driver.\u201d Tony supplied. \u201cBut I dabble in mechanics too. More of a hobby than anything.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d Howard narrowed his eyes and Tony straightened under the suspicious gaze, waiting for the accusations of spying in Howard\u2019s work, of cutting corners, for there to be no way that Tony knew how to do that, so he must be cheating\u2013</p><p>\u201cSmart ass.\u201d Howard finally said, and when Tony only blinked at him, Howard laughed. \u201cI like it. Seems to me like your wasted driving Agent. Carter around but hey, I\u2019d do it if it gave me a chance to be close to her too.\u201d </p><p>\u201cUh\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, while they are tracking down Nazi\u2019s\u2013\u201d Howard motioned out the door to where Peggy and Steve had chased the HYDRA agent. \u201cAnd they are\u2026mourning.\u201d a flicker of sadness as he looked over to where Dr. Erskine was lying covered in a sheet. \u201cI have machinery to fix. Do you want to help, or do you have something else going on?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Tony shook his head, already rolling up his sleeves. \u201cLet\u2019s fix some things.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Howard grinned and Tony grinned right back, his heart aching a little seeing a smile that he had <i>rarely </i>seen growing up. \u201cThis isn\u2019t too low tech for you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll manage.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell, grab a wrench, then.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>*******************</p><p>*******************</p><p>That night, Tony found Steve standing on the balcony of his hotel room, staring out across the city with a forlorn expression, his arms folded tight across his chest. </p><p>\u201cSteve.\u201d Tony reached up\u2013 <i>ugh</i>, he hated that\u2013 to put a hand on Steve\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about Dr. Erskine.\u201d </p><p>Steve didn\u2019t answer, and Tony joined him at the rail. \u201cHow are you feeling? Any weird side effects?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a headache for about three minutes.\u201d he said shortly. \u201cLegs hurt. Arms hurt from growing so much.\u201d he dragged in a deep breath. \u201cRibs don\u2019t hurt though. Feel like I can breathe for the first time in my life. Heartbeats steady. It\u2019s nice.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026good.\u201d Tony murmured, and fell silent, waiting for Steve to say whatever else was on his mind. </p><p>It took a full ten minutes of silence between them but Steve finally said, \u201cThey want me to go on tour with a USO show. Encourage people to buy bonds and volunteer for the cause and all that. Say that a big guy like me in a red white and blue outfit would be the perfect patriotic symbol.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlright?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThey gave me a promotion.\u201d Steve continued. \u201c<i>Captain America</i> they want to call me. Yesterday I was plain old Steve Rogers, now I\u2019m a <i>Captain</i>. Bucky would be so proud.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSteve\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to be a <i>soldier</i>, Tony. I went through with this whole thing so I could go and fight Nazi\u2019s, so I could save people, and now I\u2019ll be the equivalent of a circus animal. Dressed up, trotted out, paraded around for money while pretty girls sing. It\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s humiliating.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSteve\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cI should have stayed home and collected scrap metal.\u201d He said bitterly. \u201cWould be making just as much of a difference huh? Dr. Erskine died for this, for <i>me</i>, and I can\u2019t even live up to what he expected from me. He said I was special, said I was good, that the serum would amplify all of that but\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou <i>are </i>special, Steve.\u201d Tony started helplessly. \u201cI mean, you are\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cEverything special about me came out of a test tube!\u201d Steve shouted, and Tony backed up a step in surprise, his hand going to his chest as it started hurting, remembering another conversation between the two of them that had gone much the same way. </p><p>Except <i>Tony </i>had been saying those words, and had been too angry to register the hurt in Steve\u2019s eyes\u2013 the hurt he could see so plainly right now.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing special about me.\u201d Steve repeated. \u201cSure, I can lift a motorcycle now. I can run faster than most cars, I can\u2013 I mean, I caught a <i>submarine </i>Tony. Caught it and ripped the top off. Last week I couldn\u2019t make it up the stairs to our apartment without coughing. Today, I jumped an eight foot fence without blinking. But it\u2019s all the serum. And even <i>with </i>the serum I\u2019m still someone that can\u2019t go to war, someone who is being told he can\u2019t fight, someone who isn\u2019t good enough.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not good enough, Tony.\u201d He was whispering now, big shoulders slumped in resignation. \u201cEven after all this. I\u2019m <i>still not good enough</i>.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2013\u201d Tony didn\u2019t know what to say, didn\u2019t even know where to start. \u201cUm, Steve\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow did you like Howard?\u201d Steve changed the subject and Tony blinked a few times in surprise. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a prick.\u201d he said slowly. \u201cBut brilliant. Probably a good guy to keep around. Why do you ask?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think Peggy likes him.\u201d Steve made a fist, staring down at his hand. \u201cThey do this weird thing where they look at each other and don\u2019t say anything and then smile and I don\u2019t know what to do with that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fairly certain Peggy has no interest in Mr. Stark.\u201d Tony denied instantly, shuddering over the thought of his aunt and his father hooking up. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter anyway.\u201d Steve pushed away from the railing, moving back into his room. \u201cShe\u2019s going to go off to war, and I\u2019m going to head to a stage with a line of dancing girls. No sense pining over someone I can\u2019t have.\u201d </p><p>He slumped onto the bed, and after a few seconds of hesitation, Tony climbed right onto the bed next to him, close enough that their shoulders bumped. </p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be all bad.\u201d he said carefully and Steve closed his eyes with a muffled groan. \u201cNo, I\u2019m serious.\u201d Tony nudged him playfully. \u201cI mean, with that new booty, you will look <i>great </i>in tights.\u201d </p><p>A long, tense moment, and Steve finally started to smile, then he was chuckling and when Tony started grinning, it turned into full fledged laughter until both of them were gasping for breath wiping tears from their eyes. </p><p>\u201cTony\u2013 Tony this has been the craziest day of my life.\u201d Steve admitted, reaching for a glass of water. \u201cWho I was this morning and who I am now, everything that\u2019s happened\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the same person tonight that you were this morning.\u201d Tony said firmly. \u201cJust you know, taller.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo am I a <i>snack </i>now, Tony?\u201d </p><p>\u201cA whole damn <i>meal</i>, Captain America.\u201d Tony shoved at him. \u201cJust be careful, there\u2019s a whole world of women out there who would love to experience that meal first hand. </p><p>\u201cOh good Christ, don\u2019t call me Captain America.\u201d Steve slid further down in the sheets, closing his eyes and yawning loudly. \u201cThat sounds awful. I hate that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI bet you\u2019ll learn to like it.\u201d Tony started to get off the bed. \u201cAnd don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t notice that you didn\u2019t comment on how terrible it will be to have all those pretty women trying to take a bite out of you. I\u2019m on to you Rogers.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything, Tony.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI know more than you think, Spangles. Like that your giant ass needs to sleep.\u201d Tony flipped a few lights off. \u201cI hear show business is a demanding life, all the make up and the glitter and the costumes and the\u2013\u201d</p><p>A pillow was winged at him and Tony <i>acked</i>! as he went down beneath it. </p><p>\u201cOh shit!\u201d Steve leapt from the bed and helped Tony back up. \u201cSorry about that, Tony, I forgot to check my strength. Still getting used to it all. Didn\u2019t mean to flatten you like that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Captain America</i>.\u201d Tony huffed and grabbed his hat off the ground. \u201cYou are setting a terrible example for children across the country by starting unprovoked pillow fights with civilians. <i>Honestly</i>.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Completely unrepentant, Steve only grinned before flopping back on the bed. \u201cGood night, Tony.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGood night, Steve.\u201d </p><p>Tony closed the door and crossed the room to the one that had been provided for him by Steve\u2019s new boss, Senator Brandt. </p><p>It hadn\u2019t taken much convincing at all to encourage the Senator that Tony was Steve\u2019s manager, the one to be handling his finances because the Senator wouldn\u2019t <i>dream </i>of using Steve as an employee of the United States, putting him through all the physical strain of performing and traveling without cutting him a paycheck, wasn\u2019t that right? Steve was patriotic, but <i>no one</i> was that patriotic. </p><p>The Senator had smiled a wonderfully fake smile, shaken Tony\u2019s hand and proclaimed him part of the project and now here they were, set for a rehearsal by the end of the week, a first show by the end of next. </p><p>The Star Spangled Man with a Plan was about to take America by storm, inspire comics and cartoons and movies and all of that sort of thing, and Tony was going to be right next to him for it all. </p><p>Tony checked the date on the calender on the wall, his hand a bit unsteady as he touched the page. </p><p>Steve was Captain America now, which was the first big step to start everything else off.\u00a0</p><p>It was only a matter of time before they ended up over seas, performing for the 107th, finding Bucky, <i>losing </i>Bucky\u2014</p><p>It was only a matter of time, and as Tony stretched out on the hotel bed, he stared up at the ceiling and started counting down the days until the end.</p><p>**********************</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnC55Xt5xdhEUuVPTO0Orvw\">@bornwithgasolineheart</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\"

Don&rsquo;t be so clingy.&rdquo;<b><br /></b></p><p>&ldquo;But it will be a few more weeks before he actually gets the letter, so by the time he reads it, he will have been gone two months, now won&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; Tony pushed Steve further away. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not&hellip; <i>clingy</i>. He <i>asked </i>me to write to him. Very nicely I might add. How could I say no?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;He asked you to&ndash;&rdquo; Steve shook his head. &ldquo;He <i>asked </i>you to write to him? Like you&rsquo;re his girl or something?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fairly certain Bucky knows I&rsquo;m not a <i>girl</i>.&rdquo; Tony deadpanned. &ldquo;But he asked me to be his fella, yeah. I have to admit, no one has ever asked me out quite like that before. It was&hellip; charming.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Charming.&rdquo; Steve sat back in the seat, thin arms folded. &ldquo;And you said&hellip; yes. To being Bucky&rsquo;s fella.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I did.&rdquo; Tony signed the short letter with a quick flourish. &ldquo;Have you ever had that guy ask you anything? One look at those baby blues and I&rsquo;d give him a new car.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Tony paused, fully expecting Steve to laugh, but the blonde stayed silent. &ldquo;Um, should I have asked you for you blessing first?&rdquo; he asked curiously. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sort of scowling at me like I&rsquo;m sneaking around with your sister when she&rsquo;s supposed to be at the convent.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Am not.&rdquo; Steve scrunched his nose in irritation. &ldquo;I got no problem with it. You two wanna be together, then&ndash;&rdquo;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No, really, you&rsquo;re looking at me like I&rsquo;m trying to get under Sister Margaret&rsquo;s habit.&rdquo; Tony stuffed the letter into an envelope and turned back to Steve. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on with you? I thought you didn&rsquo;t have a problem with me and Bucky?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a problem.&rdquo; Steve insisted. &ldquo;I was just&ndash; I was just wondering. Is it always that easy?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Is <i>what </i>always that easy?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What you and Bucky have!&rdquo; Steve&rsquo;s voice rose a little and Tony frowned at him in confusion. &ldquo;You make it look so easy! Is it always like that? You know, you meet someone, think they&rsquo;re real fine lookin&rsquo;? Flirt a little, fall into bed and then you&rsquo;re in love? Is it that easy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh&ndash;&rdquo; Tony cleared his throat. &ldquo;Uh, Steve, Bucky and I aren&rsquo;t&ndash;I mean, I don&rsquo;t think we are&ndash;Um&ndash; I mean, yeah its worked out really well for us since we only knew each other a week, but I wouldn&rsquo;t say we are&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t seem fair is all.&rdquo; A disappointed shrug, Steve not even listening to Tony&rsquo;s stammered speech. &ldquo;Bucky don&rsquo;t even like girls, has to hide who he is all the time cos people kinda hate people like him, and he <i>still </i>finds love before me?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh. That&ndash; that wasn&rsquo;t what I was expecting you to say.&rdquo; Tony looked a little closer at Steve, noting the tired lines around his eyes, the weariness in the sloop of his shoulder. &ldquo;Steve, are you&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Will you help me talk to Agent Carter?&rdquo; Steve interrupted. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s so pretty, and I like her alot and today&rsquo;s going to be the first time I&rsquo;m spending time with her alone, and I&rsquo;m nervous about it. You have any advice?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You want my advice on how to talk to Agent Carter.&rdquo; Tony repeated, covering his mouth with his hand so Steve wouldn&rsquo;t know he wanted to laugh. &ldquo;What makes you think I know how to talk to girls? All you&rsquo;ve seen is me flirt with Bucky and honestly, it hasn&rsquo;t been that smooth. I know you think its been easy, but considering&ndash;&rdquo; Tony closed his eyes briefly, thinking about how close to a mental breakdown he&rsquo;d been the first few days.&nbsp;&ldquo;Considering everything that has been going on, its fairly amazing anything happened at all between me and Bucky.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you love him.&rdquo; Steve said matter of factly.&nbsp;&ldquo;So obviously something is right about you two.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&rdquo; Tony started to deny that he loved Bucky, but Steve looked so sure about it all, that the words sort of died on his tongue.&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. There is something&hellip; <i>right </i>about Bucky and I.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something right about Agent Carter too.&rdquo; Steve said wistfully.&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it is, Tony. We&rsquo;ve only talked a handful of times, but I want to know her. Can you help me with that?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re doing just fine with her by yourself.&rdquo; Tony patted his shoulder.&nbsp;&ldquo;She likes you, Steve, trust me.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to call you a liar, Tony, but&ndash;&rdquo; Steve motioned down his body.&nbsp;&ldquo;I need all the help I can get, and that means more than my friend reassuring me, you know?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; Tony jumped to his feet and motioned for Steve to stand up too. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to give you the same advice my Honeybear&ndash;&rdquo; a blank look, and Tony explained, &ldquo;&ndash;my best friend. I&rsquo;m going to give you the same advice my best friend gave me when I started dating.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Steve stood up slowly, wiping his hands down his slacks. &ldquo;Was it good advice?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Um&hellip;&rdquo; Tony pursed his lips. &ldquo;Um, okay so the thing about my Honeybear is that he <i>thinks </i>he has great advice, and maybe it <i>is </i>great advice when you&rsquo;re as good looking as he is, but for those of us that have to work at being cute&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You sweet on your&hellip; honeybear&hellip; too?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Tony stopped in surprise and Steve raised his eyebrows in question. &ldquo;Oh, because I called him good looking?&rdquo; A quick shake of his head. &ldquo;Uh no, not sweet on him. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, Rhodey is a snack but&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;A <i>what</i>?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting off topic.&rdquo; Tony grinned and cleared his throat. &ldquo;Alright, Steve, the first dating advice Rhodey ever gave me was exactly this:: Stand up straight, <i>never </i>ask how they are doing, <i>always </i>compliment their shoes.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Stand up straight.&rdquo; Steve squared his shoulders, tilting his chin up. &ldquo;Never ask how they are &ndash; Wait, why wouldn&rsquo;t I ask how Agent Carter is doing? That&rsquo;s just being polite, what&rsquo;s wrong with that?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Because <i>you </i>might think you are just asking how she&rsquo;s doing.&rdquo; Tony fussed with Steve&rsquo;s tie. &ldquo;But you come out sounding like a total Joey.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand that reference.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Of course you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Tony backed up a few steps, folded his arms over his chest, looked Steve over from top to toe, and then smirked and asked, &ldquo;How <i>you </i>doing?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo; Steve scowled at him. &ldquo;That is <i>awful</i>, why would you say it like that? Why do you sound so&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Creepy?&rdquo; Tony finished.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yep, it sounds <i>creepy</i>, that&rsquo;s why we don&rsquo;t ask how she is doing. Instead, you could smile and ask how her day is going. It lets her know that you are interested in her activities, but also is a generic enough question that she can reply <i>fine </i>and leave without being rude. If she wants to keep talking to you, she can. If she doesn&rsquo;t want to, she isn&rsquo;t trapped into a conversation that she feels obligated to continue, you know?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fair.&rdquo; Steve nodded thoughtfully. &ldquo;So I ask her how her days is going, and then I compliment her shoes?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Why her shoes?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Because if you&rsquo;re going to check her out, you should at least say something nice and every woman likes to talk about her shoes.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Tony, I&rsquo;m not going to check her&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>Tony just <i>looked </i>at him, and Steve sighed and looked away. </p><p>&ldquo;Yep, that&rsquo;s what I thought. Stand up straight, ask how her day is, say something nice about her shoes. Fool proof.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah? It&rsquo;s worked for you the first time?&rdquo; Steve reached for his khaki shirt, buttoning it up before tucking his tie in. &ldquo;Fool proof?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It worked like a champ.&rdquo; Tony promised, running his fingers over the pleats in Steve&rsquo;s hat before handing it over. &ldquo;Right up until my date for the evening realized I was too young to buy her a drink, and then I struck out <i>spectacularly</i>, but you don&rsquo;t have to worry about either of those things because you are old enough to buy Agent Carter a beer, <i>and </i>she already likes you.&rdquo; </p><p>He leaned away to look over Steve&rsquo;s outfit critically. &ldquo;And after they give you this top secret serum, you&rsquo;ll be a snack too so&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;A <i>snack</i>?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo; Tony grinned and clapped a hand on Steve&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Everyone in the room will want to take a bite out of you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;.thanks?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You are very welcome.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>**********************</p><p>**********************</p><p>&ldquo;Remind me again why it was necessary for Mr. Carbonell to join us on our little expedition?&rdquo; Peggy asked as she marched down the long hallway, Steve almost jogging to catch up, Tony trailing a step behind, fully content to smirk at the back of his friends head. </p><p>&ldquo;Tony is one of my best friends.&rdquo; Steve shot Tony a look over his shoulder. &ldquo;And I thought I was allowed someone in there with me for support.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I thought you would bring a priest.&rdquo; Peggy took a file from someone and signed her name quickly before handing it back, never missing a step. &ldquo;Or your <i>bookie</i>. Not my driver. I wasn&rsquo;t even aware the two of you were friends.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Apparently best friends.&rdquo; Tony said with a pleased grin.&nbsp;&ldquo;And I am happy to pray over Steve if he needs it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t need prayers, Tony, thank you. And also, I don&rsquo;t gamble, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; Steve was quick to assure Peggy, and with another uncertain glance back at Tony, he added, &ldquo;I like your shoes, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon?&rdquo; Peggy stopped so quickly that Tony almost smacked into her. &ldquo;I must have misheard you?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; Steve shook his head. &ldquo;I simply noticed you had new shoes, thought to comment on them.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You are about to undergo an extremely experimental, entirely life altering procedure, and you wanted to take the time to talk about my <i>shoes</i>?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I would also like to take the time to ask how your day is.&rdquo; Steve straightened his lean frame, eyebrows raised invitingly. &ldquo;Or if you had done anything interesting.&rdquo; </p><p>Peggy narrowed her eyes at him, and Tony made an impressed noise when Steve didn&rsquo;t so much as flinch, keeping the same open expression and easy smile. </p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she began slowly. &ldquo;I am very tense today as you can imagine, since my particular branch of the armed forces is responsible for everything that happens in the next few hours. I spent a short and yet rather informative drive sitting across from a the most stubborn soldier I&rsquo;ve ever met&ndash;&rdquo; her gaze met his meaningfully, and then flicked to Tony. &ldquo;&ndash;and his consistently overdressed friend, so <i>yes</i>, you could say I&rsquo;ve had an interesting day so far.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Steve cleared his throat. &ldquo;And&ndash;and your shoes?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;My shoes are new.&rdquo; Peggy gave him a brief smile. &ldquo;Very sweet of you to notice, also very <i>surprising </i>that you noticed.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;If I can be bold?&rdquo; Steve cleared his throat.&nbsp;&ldquo;I notice just about everything about you, Agent Carter.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Peggy&rsquo;s eyes flickered, her hand going to her hair to adjust a curl that didn&rsquo;t need to be adjusted at all, and Tony hid his smile.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Seems like Aunt Peggy had developed that little nervous tic of hers <i>decades </i>before Tony picked up on it.</p><p>&ldquo;Right, well gentlemen, we are going to be late if we dilly dally and longer. Shall we?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Right. Right of course.&rdquo; Steve started walking again when Peggy did, and when he looked back again, Tony shot him a thumbs up and an exaggerated wink. </p><p>Rhodey&rsquo;s advice was fool proof.<i> Get&nbsp;&lsquo;em Cap.</i></p><p>Bolstered by the positive response from Peggy, Steve was just opening his mouth to say something else that maybe slightly resembled flirting, but Peggy pushed through a huge set of double doors and suddenly they were in a lab big enough to even bring <i>Tony </i>to a surprised halt. </p><p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;ll be a son of a bit&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Ah- ah. Language Mr. Carbonell.&rdquo; Peggy said at the same time Steve said, &ldquo;Tony! <i>Language</i>!&rdquo; </p><p>Tony looked between the two of them with an amused smile, and Peggy tinged the slightest bit pink when Steve grinned at her. &ldquo;Imagine that, I&rsquo;m friends with <i>two </i>people who don&rsquo;t approve of my language.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I wonder how many other things we have in common, Agent Carter.&rdquo; Steve added, closing one blue eyes in a rather bold wink. </p><p>&ldquo;Well then.&rdquo; Peggy cleared her throat and touched her hair again. &ldquo;They are waiting for you down below, Rogers. Mr. Carbonell, you are welcome to come down to the floor with us, but please maintain a respectful distance. It is very kind of you to accompany Mr. Rogers for emotional support, but I still can&rsquo;t have you down on the floor and in the way, so say your goodbye now?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Tony stepped back and Steve moved with him, standing close enough that Tony could grab his hand. &ldquo;Go on and meet your destiny, blondie. This is going be amazing.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks for coming with me.&rdquo; Steve muttered, tightening his hold on Tony&rsquo;s fingers.&nbsp;&ldquo;Means a lot.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even worry about it. I&rsquo;ll be here when everything is over too, alright?&rdquo; Over Steve&rsquo;s head, Peggy was tapping her foot a little impatiently and Tony nodded that he saw.&nbsp;&ldquo;You have to go though, here comes Dr. Erskine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um, Tony&mdash;&ldquo; Steve looked a little panicked, but he didn&rsquo;t have time to finish his thought as Dr Erskine came up to shake his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m right here.&rdquo; Tony mouthed and flashed Steve a double thumbs up. &ldquo;You got it, Steve. You got it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um&ndash;&rdquo; Steve kept looking back over his shoulder as Dr. Erskine led him onto the platform, and Tony was struck all over again by how vulnerable this Steve was, and how well he hid it behind that stubborn jaw. </p><p>&ldquo;You got it.&rdquo; he repeated quietly, and tried to smile, relieved when Steve finally smiled back at him. </p><p>&ldquo;Sheesh, someone get that kid a sandwich.&rdquo; Someone muttered behind Tony, and he turned around to snark back but stopped mid motion when he saw Steve climb up onto the table, looking paler, skinnier without his shirt, and the <i>enormity </i>of the situation hit him all at once.</p><p>Tony <i>knew </i>the serum worked of course, he knew that it was painful and that they had blacked out half of Brooklyn with the surge, and that Steve fell out of that chamber a shocking six foot two and two hundred plus pounds of All American beefcake.</p><p>Tony knew <i>all </i>of that. </p><p>But that knowledge didn&rsquo;t stop him from leaning over the rail and watching closely, straining to see every emotion that crossed Steve&rsquo;s face, the tiny twitches and the way his breathing picked up, fidgeting with his fingers, starting to bit at his bottom lip and then stopping himself. </p><p><i>Captain America is scared to death. </i></p><p>&ldquo;Can I go down there with him?&rdquo; Tony blurted before he could stop himself. &ldquo;Agent Carter, can I go down there with him? He shouldn&rsquo;t be alone right now, look at him! He needs someone there with him!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Carbonell, if they kicked me off the operating room floor, I have very little doubt they will demand you leave as well.&rdquo; Peggy&rsquo;s voice was regretful.&nbsp;&ldquo;I wish i could stand next to him too, but this is something he has to do alone.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo; Tony cursed under his breath.&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>Right</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It is good of you to want to be there for your friend, though.&rdquo; she added after a few seconds. &ldquo;How long have you two known each other?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;years.&rdquo; Tony answered quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known him for <i>years </i>but it&rsquo;s only been the last little while that we&rsquo;ve gotten closer.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky to have each other.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;yeah.&rdquo; he nodded slowly. &ldquo;Yeah we are.&rdquo; </p><p>********************</p><p>********************</p><p>&ldquo;Are you comfortable?&rdquo; Dr. Erskine asked, touching the straps around Steve&rsquo;s midsection. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid this is the tightest they go.&rdquo; </p><p>Steve licked his lips before answering, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little big.&rdquo; When Dr. Erskine laughed, Steve added, &ldquo;Did you save me any of the schnapps?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Not as much as I should have.&rdquo; the scientist patted his arm and chuckled again, and turned to start making a speech to the military personnel gathered in the room. </p><p>Steve tuned out most of it, the words only a buzz in his ears as he stared around at the bright lights and machinery that was powering up across from him. </p><p>Mr. Stark approached him, hooking leads up to his chest and Steve smiled a little thinking about how excited Bucky would have been to be meeting <i>Howard Stark</i> of all people, then frowned a few seconds later because he knew Bucky would hate this. </p><p>He would <i>hate </i>it. </p><p>Steve started trembling thinking about his best friend, his heart pounding as he thought first about how upset Bucky would be, and then how good it would be to go on to fight side by side with him. How good it would be to put on that uniform and run out side by side. It was all he wanted. All he had <i>ever </i>wanted and now it was so close he could almost&ndash;</p><p>Howard glanced up from all the dials and levers in front of him to lay a reassuring hand on Steve&rsquo;s arm when his rising heart rate made the machine start beeping. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, soldier.&rdquo; he said with an easy wink. &ldquo;The doc told me you were at the Expo? I can promise that this all works much better than my flying car.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I uh&ndash; I thought your car worked pretty well.&rdquo; Steve said lamely.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sure seemed like it would be alright, maybe.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh.&rdquo; Howard went back to adjusting the levers or dials or <i>whatever </i>it all was. &ldquo;You must have seen a different demonstration, because I&rsquo;m pretty sure mine was terrible.&rdquo; He smiled and Steve couldn&rsquo;t help smiling back. &ldquo;You have bigger things to worry about than flying cars though. I&rsquo;d like to say this is all roses, but it&rsquo;s going to give you a hell of a headache and probably growing pains so&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Growing pains</i>?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Uh yep.&rdquo; Howard studied Steve for a minute. &ldquo;I bet this little jolt in the ass will put almost a foot of height on you. More than a hundred pounds definitely. You&rsquo;ll be able to catch the eye of whoever you want.&rdquo; he cracked a grin that was so surprisingly <i>familiar </i>that all Steve could do was blink in surprise. &ldquo;Mostly because you&rsquo;ll be too big for them to ignore, huh? Huh?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That was a terrible joke.&rdquo; Steve laughed and Howard shrugged it off.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I make jokes whenever I&rsquo;m uncomfortable.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I know other people who do that.&rdquo; Steve squinted through the lights until he could make out Peggy standing straight and tall at the top of the stairs, and then he looked next to here to what was definitely Tony, fedora sat at a ridiculous angle, leaning over the railing and staring down at Steve. </p><p><i>Huh</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; Dr. Erskine was back, and Steve forced his eyes back to the doctor.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it too late to go to the bathroom?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo; Erskine smiled once more at Steve and then motioned to Mr. Stark. &ldquo;Shall we?&rdquo; </p><p>*******************</p><p>*******************</p><p>From the stories, Tony had thought it would take <i>ages</i>. </p><p>Howard always talked about this part as if it had dragged on for days&ndash; the machines powering up, the brightening light, the way Steve screamed and then refused to let them shut it down even though everyone was scrambling to pull the plug. Howard shouting the percentages, Peggy with both hands over her mouth, the gathered generals and senators murmuring uncertainly. The heart stopping moment where everything hit a <i>hundred </i>and then started winding down, the pod opening with a hiss and Steve nearly falling out of it, staggering on his new legs and dragging in deep breaths. </p><p>Howard had always talked about it as if it had dragged on for days, but it was over in a matter of minutes, and Tony didn&rsquo;t take his eyes off the pod once.</p><p>Everyone was talking, shouting in surprise and amazement when Steve straightened to his newly impressive height. Peggy pushed her way through the crowd to get up close and personal with Steve and Tony wanted to laugh when he saw her reach out to touch a more than defined pec, pulling her hand away at the last minute and touching her hair nervously. </p><p>Steve was grinning, staring down at himself, looking around at all the people he was suddenly towering over, finally looking up and meeting Tony&rsquo;s eyes across the space. </p><p>Tony offered a wave and a little smile, hoping Steve&rsquo;s vision hadn&rsquo;t sharpened enough to see the sadness he couldn&rsquo;t quite hide. </p><p>Howard had always talked about it as if it had dragged on for days, but it had been barely one breath to the next, and the Steve Tony had just barely gotten to know was was gone, Captain America standing in his place. </p><p>It all happened so much faster than Howard had said. </p><p>Everything else happened in record time, though. </p><p>Tony was just starting to walk down the stairs when the explosion rocked the lab and people started screaming. </p><p>Too caught up in the moment, Tony had forgotten about this, had forgotten about the HYDRA agent that had been in the same room.&nbsp;</p><p>The bomb knocked threw him into the wall, and Tony was just getting to his feet again, palms scraped, nose bleeding, when gun shots sounded and the agent came running up the stairs past him.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony reached out to stop him, grabbed onto the a trouser leg to try and slow him down, but a swift kick to his ribs had him rolling further down the stairs, wheezing and holding on to his sides. </p><p>Peggy and Steve went flying past him just like they were supposed to, Peggy with her gun already drawn, Steve stumbling over his feet as he tried to get used to his new height, and when he skittered to a stop to try and check on Tony, Tony only waved him on. </p><p>He was fine. He knew Steve had to get out the door and after that HYDRA agent because waiting even a <i>minute </i>would mean that Steve would be too late to swim after the submarine, and the man would escape, and it would ruin everything.&nbsp;</p><p>History couldn&rsquo;t stop, not even for Tony&rsquo;s most likely broken ribs. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s eyes shot open wide when Howard leaned over to offer him a hand up. &ldquo;That was quite a fall you took. You dead, dying or-&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;&ndash;bleeding.&rdquo; Tony interrupted, pulling his hand from his nose to show Howard the blood. &ldquo;No. Not dead or dying, but I am bleeding so&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>Howard stared at him in confusion, and Tony realized belatedly that he had finished his dad&rsquo;s sentence, and that that was <i>weird</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, sorry. My dad always said the same thing to me.&rdquo; Wow it was&hellip; <i>different</i>&hellip;to lie to his dad and not really be lying at all.&nbsp;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to interrupt you.&rdquo;</p><p>Time travel. <i>Sheesh</i>. </p><p>&ldquo;Civilian, huh?&rdquo; Howard pulled Tony to his feet, trying not to jostle his ribs. &ldquo;How did you manage to be invited to this sort of thing? This is supposed to be military brass and Capitol Hill employees only.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Agent Carter&rsquo;s driver.&rdquo; Tony said blandly and Howard&rsquo;s eyebrows shot up. &ldquo;And um, Steve&rsquo;s friend?&rdquo; Another unimpressed look. &ldquo;Also, I know a lot about this sort of thing.&rdquo; he motioned around the room. &ldquo;So. Several reasons to be here.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You know a lot about this sort of thing?&rdquo; Howard repeated. &ldquo;<i>Really</i>? Because I built these machines by hand. The blueprints don&rsquo;t even exist outside of my head. What exactly do you think you know about this sort of thing?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>And there it was&ndash; that condescending, caustic tone that Howard had perfected by the time Tony was old enough to argue with him. A mocking, usually rhetorical question delivered with a cutting smile and a faux interested expression.&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, or maybe unfortunately, Tony wasn&rsquo;t a ten year old kid looking for his dad&rsquo;s approval anymore, so he stared Howard down for a long minute before cocking his head and turning to look over at the only machine still running in the nearly destroyed lab.&nbsp;</p><p>All the needles in the displays were edging towards red as the huge server began to overheat, a terrible whining noise coming from the overworked fans as they ran non stop trying to force the machine to cool before things started melting or possibly exploding.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What do I know about this sort of thing?&rdquo; Tony repeated and limped over to the machine, dropping to his knees and rolling onto his back before scooting underneath it.&nbsp;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind if I fix this do you? Nah, you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What the hell are you doing!&rdquo; Howard cried.&nbsp;&ldquo;That machine is worth more than your&ndash;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Shush.&rdquo; Tony held a finger out and crawled deeper beneath it, groaning as his ribs pulled.&nbsp;&ldquo;Give me a sec. I&rsquo;m not used to such low tech but I should be able to&ndash;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;LOW TECH! I&rsquo;ll have you know&ndash;!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Shush</i>!&rdquo; Tony said louder, and with a little maneuvering, managed to separate the wires that were crossed beneath the baseboard, rerouting one of them into a different server, shocking himself terribly, but grinning when the machine finally fell silent, the fans slowing to a more manageable pace as the unit started regulating its own temperature again. </p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; A pained grunt as he stood back up and fixed Howard with a smug look. &ldquo;Now at least that annoying noise isn&rsquo;t happening anymore.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&ndash;I&ndash;&rdquo; Howard was speechless, and Tony was about as happy as he had ever been, finally getting a chance to show his father up. &ldquo;Um, what did you say you did again?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Agent Carter&rsquo;s driver.&rdquo; Tony supplied. &ldquo;But I dabble in mechanics too. More of a hobby than anything.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hm.&rdquo; Howard narrowed his eyes and Tony straightened under the suspicious gaze, waiting for the accusations of spying in Howard&rsquo;s work, of cutting corners, for there to be no way that Tony knew how to do that, so he must be cheating&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;Smart ass.&rdquo; Howard finally said, and when Tony only blinked at him, Howard laughed. &ldquo;I like it. Seems to me like your wasted driving Agent. Carter around but hey, I&rsquo;d do it if it gave me a chance to be close to her too.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Uh&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, while they are tracking down Nazi&rsquo;s&ndash;&rdquo; Howard motioned out the door to where Peggy and Steve had chased the HYDRA agent. &ldquo;And they are&hellip;mourning.&rdquo; a flicker of sadness as he looked over to where Dr. Erskine was lying covered in a sheet. &ldquo;I have machinery to fix. Do you want to help, or do you have something else going on?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo; Tony shook his head, already rolling up his sleeves. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s fix some things.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Howard grinned and Tony grinned right back, his heart aching a little seeing a smile that he had <i>rarely </i>seen growing up. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t too low tech for you?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll manage.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well, grab a wrench, then.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>*******************</p><p>*******************</p><p>That night, Tony found Steve standing on the balcony of his hotel room, staring out across the city with a forlorn expression, his arms folded tight across his chest. </p><p>&ldquo;Steve.&rdquo; Tony reached up&ndash; <i>ugh</i>, he hated that&ndash; to put a hand on Steve&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about Dr. Erskine.&rdquo; </p><p>Steve didn&rsquo;t answer, and Tony joined him at the rail. &ldquo;How are you feeling? Any weird side effects?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I had a headache for about three minutes.&rdquo; he said shortly. &ldquo;Legs hurt. Arms hurt from growing so much.&rdquo; he dragged in a deep breath. &ldquo;Ribs don&rsquo;t hurt though. Feel like I can breathe for the first time in my life. Heartbeats steady. It&rsquo;s nice.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip;good.&rdquo; Tony murmured, and fell silent, waiting for Steve to say whatever else was on his mind. </p><p>It took a full ten minutes of silence between them but Steve finally said, &ldquo;They want me to go on tour with a USO show. Encourage people to buy bonds and volunteer for the cause and all that. Say that a big guy like me in a red white and blue outfit would be the perfect patriotic symbol.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Alright?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;They gave me a promotion.&rdquo; Steve continued. &ldquo;<i>Captain America</i> they want to call me. Yesterday I was plain old Steve Rogers, now I&rsquo;m a <i>Captain</i>. Bucky would be so proud.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Steve&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m supposed to be a <i>soldier</i>, Tony. I went through with this whole thing so I could go and fight Nazi&rsquo;s, so I could save people, and now I&rsquo;ll be the equivalent of a circus animal. Dressed up, trotted out, paraded around for money while pretty girls sing. It&rsquo;s&ndash; it&rsquo;s humiliating.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Steve&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I should have stayed home and collected scrap metal.&rdquo; He said bitterly. &ldquo;Would be making just as much of a difference huh? Dr. Erskine died for this, for <i>me</i>, and I can&rsquo;t even live up to what he expected from me. He said I was special, said I was good, that the serum would amplify all of that but&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You <i>are </i>special, Steve.&rdquo; Tony started helplessly. &ldquo;I mean, you are&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Everything special about me came out of a test tube!&rdquo; Steve shouted, and Tony backed up a step in surprise, his hand going to his chest as it started hurting, remembering another conversation between the two of them that had gone much the same way. </p><p>Except <i>Tony </i>had been saying those words, and had been too angry to register the hurt in Steve&rsquo;s eyes&ndash; the hurt he could see so plainly right now.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing special about me.&rdquo; Steve repeated. &ldquo;Sure, I can lift a motorcycle now. I can run faster than most cars, I can&ndash; I mean, I caught a <i>submarine </i>Tony. Caught it and ripped the top off. Last week I couldn&rsquo;t make it up the stairs to our apartment without coughing. Today, I jumped an eight foot fence without blinking. But it&rsquo;s all the serum. And even <i>with </i>the serum I&rsquo;m still someone that can&rsquo;t go to war, someone who is being told he can&rsquo;t fight, someone who isn&rsquo;t good enough.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not good enough, Tony.&rdquo; He was whispering now, big shoulders slumped in resignation. &ldquo;Even after all this. I&rsquo;m <i>still not good enough</i>.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&rdquo; Tony didn&rsquo;t know what to say, didn&rsquo;t even know where to start. &ldquo;Um, Steve&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;How did you like Howard?&rdquo; Steve changed the subject and Tony blinked a few times in surprise. </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a prick.&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;But brilliant. Probably a good guy to keep around. Why do you ask?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I think Peggy likes him.&rdquo; Steve made a fist, staring down at his hand. &ldquo;They do this weird thing where they look at each other and don&rsquo;t say anything and then smile and I don&rsquo;t know what to do with that.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fairly certain Peggy has no interest in Mr. Stark.&rdquo; Tony denied instantly, shuddering over the thought of his aunt and his father hooking up. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about that.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter anyway.&rdquo; Steve pushed away from the railing, moving back into his room. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s going to go off to war, and I&rsquo;m going to head to a stage with a line of dancing girls. No sense pining over someone I can&rsquo;t have.&rdquo; </p><p>He slumped onto the bed, and after a few seconds of hesitation, Tony climbed right onto the bed next to him, close enough that their shoulders bumped. </p><p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be all bad.&rdquo; he said carefully and Steve closed his eyes with a muffled groan. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m serious.&rdquo; Tony nudged him playfully. &ldquo;I mean, with that new booty, you will look <i>great </i>in tights.&rdquo; </p><p>A long, tense moment, and Steve finally started to smile, then he was chuckling and when Tony started grinning, it turned into full fledged laughter until both of them were gasping for breath wiping tears from their eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Tony&ndash; Tony this has been the craziest day of my life.&rdquo; Steve admitted, reaching for a glass of water. &ldquo;Who I was this morning and who I am now, everything that&rsquo;s happened&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the same person tonight that you were this morning.&rdquo; Tony said firmly. &ldquo;Just you know, taller.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;So am I a <i>snack </i>now, Tony?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;A whole damn <i>meal</i>, Captain America.&rdquo; Tony shoved at him. &ldquo;Just be careful, there&rsquo;s a whole world of women out there who would love to experience that meal first hand. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh good Christ, don&rsquo;t call me Captain America.&rdquo; Steve slid further down in the sheets, closing his eyes and yawning loudly. &ldquo;That sounds awful. I hate that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I bet you&rsquo;ll learn to like it.&rdquo; Tony started to get off the bed. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t think I didn&rsquo;t notice that you didn&rsquo;t comment on how terrible it will be to have all those pretty women trying to take a bite out of you. I&rsquo;m on to you Rogers.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know anything, Tony.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I know more than you think, Spangles. Like that your giant ass needs to sleep.&rdquo; Tony flipped a few lights off. &ldquo;I hear show business is a demanding life, all the make up and the glitter and the costumes and the&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>A pillow was winged at him and Tony <i>acked</i>! as he went down beneath it. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh shit!&rdquo; Steve leapt from the bed and helped Tony back up. &ldquo;Sorry about that, Tony, I forgot to check my strength. Still getting used to it all. Didn&rsquo;t mean to flatten you like that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Captain America</i>.&rdquo; Tony huffed and grabbed his hat off the ground. &ldquo;You are setting a terrible example for children across the country by starting unprovoked pillow fights with civilians. <i>Honestly</i>.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo; Completely unrepentant, Steve only grinned before flopping back on the bed. &ldquo;Good night, Tony.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Good night, Steve.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony closed the door and crossed the room to the one that had been provided for him by Steve&rsquo;s new boss, Senator Brandt. </p><p>It hadn&rsquo;t taken much convincing at all to encourage the Senator that Tony was Steve&rsquo;s manager, the one to be handling his finances because the Senator wouldn&rsquo;t <i>dream </i>of using Steve as an employee of the United States, putting him through all the physical strain of performing and traveling without cutting him a paycheck, wasn&rsquo;t that right? Steve was patriotic, but <i>no one</i> was that patriotic. </p><p>The Senator had smiled a wonderfully fake smile, shaken Tony&rsquo;s hand and proclaimed him part of the project and now here they were, set for a rehearsal by the end of the week, a first show by the end of next. </p><p>The Star Spangled Man with a Plan was about to take America by storm, inspire comics and cartoons and movies and all of that sort of thing, and Tony was going to be right next to him for it all. </p><p>Tony checked the date on the calender on the wall, his hand a bit unsteady as he touched the page. </p><p>Steve was Captain America now, which was the first big step to start everything else off.&nbsp;</p><p>It was only a matter of time before they ended up over seas, performing for the 107th, finding Bucky, <i>losing </i>Bucky&mdash;</p><p>It was only a matter of time, and as Tony stretched out on the hotel bed, he stared up at the ceiling and started counting down the days until the end.</p><p>**********************</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnC55Xt5xdhEUuVPTO0Orvw\">@bornwithgasolineheart</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb5aCs-ON5F1BGuOrdFjtAA\">@shipeveryonetogether</a>

He <i>asked </i>me to write to him. Very nicely I might add.

I have to admit, no one has ever asked me out quite like that before. It was&hellip; charming.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Charming.&rdquo; Steve sat back in the seat, thin arms folded. &ldquo;And you said&hellip; yes. To being Bucky&rsquo;s fella.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I did.&rdquo; Tony signed the short letter with a quick flourish. &ldquo;Have you ever had that guy ask you anything? One look at those baby blues and I&rsquo;d give him a new car.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tony paused, fully expecting Steve to laugh, but the blonde stayed silent. &ldquo;Um, should I have asked you for you blessing first?&rdquo; he asked curiously. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sort of scowling at me like I&rsquo;m sneaking around with your sister when she&rsquo;s supposed to be at the convent.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Am not.&rdquo; Steve scrunched his nose in irritation. &ldquo;I got no problem with it. You two wanna be together, then&ndash;&rdquo;&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;No, really, you&rsquo;re looking at me like I&rsquo;m trying to get under Sister Margaret&rsquo;s habit.&rdquo; Tony stuffed the letter into an envelope and turned back to Steve. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on with you? I thought you didn&rsquo;t have a problem with me and Bucky?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n</p>",
