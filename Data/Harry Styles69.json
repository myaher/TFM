And I can&rsquo;t even do things with the both of you at the same time\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe asked me if I want to have a friendly dinner with him tonight.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI said I can&rsquo;t.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut you want to\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, I mean, we became friends through the phone calls we had. He cares a lot about me and I guess I owe him a dinner.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen go!\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut wouldn&rsquo;t it hurt you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m an adult I can find a program for myself if my best friend is not available.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFine. I&rsquo;ll go then.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d It didn&rsquo;t feel weird with Lottie. It was a normal thing that day have some common things. Harry loved her as a friend. Your friend. And Lottie has always been a huge fan of Louis and Niall, not Harry, so you weren&rsquo;t afraid of her stealing your boy. But was him your boy any more? You need to find that out. When you got back, Lottie went to eat with Harry and you were in your room reading. She came back after two hours. </p><p>\u201cHey! I thought you&rsquo;re asleep\u201d she said as she walked in. </p><p>\u201cNo, I never sleep before midnight. It&rsquo;s a side effect of touring. The concerts always end later. How was the evening?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt was really good, we caught up on things and I had to tell everything about my pregnancy. He even asked me if he can hold my belly\u201d </p><p>\u201cDid you let him?\u201d You chuckled. </p><p>\u201cYeah, he was too nice. But it&rsquo;s not that big yet so there&rsquo;s not too much to hold actually.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m sure he enjoyed it though.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe did.\u201d you two giggled.</p><p>The next day you got a message from Jeff. </p><p>\u201c5SOS will visit today. Can you give them a tour?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat the heck?\u201d you mumbled to yourself. You havent met them, but Harry told you earlier that Luke has a thing for you. Jeff didn&rsquo;t tell you, but Harry was also asked to get them around. So when you get to the back door at the given time you found Harry. </p><p>\u201cOh, hey!\u201d </p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d he waved awkwardly. </p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;re waiting for them?\u201d You asked and realized how dumb this question was, but at least it saved you from a more awkward silence. </p><p>\u201cYeah, Jeff asked me to do a tour for them,\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cWhat? Jeff asked me too for that,\u201d you were surprised. </p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess we can split up, so we don&rsquo;t have to go all together,\u201d you suggested. </p><p>\u201cYeah, sure, we can totally split from each other, I mean in this, touring \u2026.them, you know\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, totally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeeeeey!\u201d You heard someone open the door. It was Ash. They all hugged you and you told them that the tour with be split up and they seemed to be very happy about it. Luke and Ash specifically chose to go with you. </p><p>Luke and Ashton followed you as you started to talk about your work and the tour. Harry, Michael and Calum stayed behind in a seeing distance. </p><p>\u201cSo why didn&rsquo;t you chose them to get a great behind the curtain show by y/n?\u201d Harry asked them. Calum started to explain. </p><p>\u201cThe thing is. They both have a crush on her. And now they&rsquo;re both trying to impress her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe made bets, which one of them takes her on a date\u201d Michael added. Harry&rsquo;s eyes went wide open. That was the last thing he wanted to hear. But he needed to be chill.</p><p>\u201cAnd what if she doesn&rsquo;t pick?\u201d Harry asked. </p><p>\u201cOh, she will. Ashton said, if she doesn&rsquo;t seem to choose him, he&rsquo;s gonna kiss her or something. You know&hellip; to get overwhelmed by him\u201d they laughed. Harry didn&rsquo;t. </p><p>\u201c&hellip;so we became good friends fast, which makes easier to work with him\u201d you said. </p><p>\u201cDo you have a boyfriend?\u201d Luke asked. You got nervous. </p><p>\u201cThat&rsquo;s none of your business.\u201d you said. Ashton smirked. </p><p>\u201cLuke, don&rsquo;t be an ass. She&rsquo;s a lady. You don&rsquo;t ask that from a lady like this\u201d he said and wrapped his arm around your shoulder. </p><p>\u201cAnd how do you like the work so far?\u201d Ashton asked. </p><p>\u201cWe&rsquo;ll, that&rsquo;s a question I&rsquo;m gonna answer. I love it, the band, the crew, the audience are amazing\u2026\u201d you went on talking about your work. Harry hissed when he saw that Ashton&rsquo;s arm is around your shoulder and soon it was on your waist. The boys saw that he&rsquo;s intense. </p><p>\u201cWhy are you pissed, Harry? I can see it on you\u201d Michael said. </p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s just\u2026 I don&rsquo;t want anyone to hit on her\u201d he admitted. </p><p>\u201cDon&rsquo;t worry, bro. They&rsquo;re all single adults. You&rsquo;re not her dad anyway. You act like that\u201d he chuckled. \u201cBut she&rsquo;s mine\u201d Harry thought. </p><p>\u201cMan, she&rsquo;s gonna go home with one of them tonight\u201d Calum said. Harry wasn&rsquo;t so happy, but tried to take it as a joke. Your relationship wasn&rsquo;t that strong at the moment. He trusted you, but he didn&rsquo;t trust the boys. </p><p>You had to go back to your dressing room to finish some paperwork for Jeff. Harry was with the boys and the band. Ten minutes into the chatting, he realized Luke has gone missing. </p><p>You sat by the table in your room when someone knocked on the door. </p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d you saw Luke peeking his head inside. \u201cCan I come in?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d you smiled. </p><p>\u201cI just forgot to say that we saw the little video you made, when you covered Lie to Me with Mitch and Sarah\u201d he smiled as he sat down on the chair next to you. </p><p>\u201cThanks! It was really just a little fun. But. I felt that song so much at that time, it screamed for being covered\u201d you chuckled. </p><p>\u201cYou changed the lyrics even\u201d he leaned a bit closer. </p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d you were cut off saying anything because he put his lips on yours and started kissing you. His hand was on your cheek fast as he tried to deepen the kiss. You pulled away. </p><p>\u201cSorry. That was fast\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s hard to kiss when someone else is on your mind\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh. I see. So you have a boyfriend\u201d </p><p>\u201cI can&rsquo;t confirm nor deny. It&rsquo;s complicated\u201d you chuckled. \u201cBut I wanna keep a promise to someone\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course. And sorry for attacking you\u201d </p><p>\u201cLet&rsquo;s forget this, okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay\u201d he said and Harry opened the door without knocking.</p><p>\u201cThere you are, Luke. You escaped so quietly.\u201d Harry said. </p><p>\u201cYeah, I just wanted to compliment y/n&rsquo;s cover of Lie to Me. I love it,\u201d Luke said. </p><p>\u201cGuys are missing you, we still have a stack of beer to have,\u201d Luke stood up and Harry waited until he left the room. </p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;ll be there in a minute,\u201d he shouted after him and closed the door. </p><p>\u201cYou alright?\u201d He asked you. </p><p>\u201cWhy shouldn&rsquo;t I be?\u201d You smiled. </p><p>\u201cI stood by the door for a while before I came in,\u201d he admitted and looked down. </p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, I&rsquo;m fine.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWas it uh\u2026. Nevermind.\u201d He said and turned around to leave. </p><p>\u201cYes, it was you.\u201d You said quickly. He looked at you and smiled. It was sad, but it was true. </p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said and left. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"333\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"harryisart:828Fkt7aWPy-M0QbCpeDWA:Z0Qutt2gZWiHl\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/96d224424f136c9d465f7ec8c251a22e/tumblr_pno424I4gQ1rk9xsjo1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"333\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"sailorssouls:koG7DU10v1h3hwcxAH41bw:Z7Lnsb2ZHLXNa\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0eafdc8abdc4999087df3cf6bd57cfc3/tumblr_pazslskcul1wk8ulgo2_r1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"278\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"hampsteadharry:UOQFCE-vL00C7mDHsxVCEw:ZuGAvl2ZGdKHd\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aef22961454a0322bfe94661cac8aad1/tumblr_paz0d23u1r1u4m4fxo2_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"278\"/></figure><p>Later the same routine was done, you got your matching clothes, took some pictures with Harry and he left for the concert.

She was talking to one, but couldn\u2019t miss to mention Lottie. Luckily he found her. He was the sweetest guy for her. He made her feel special and important in front of thousands of people. You actually loved their friendship, like they were brother and sister. Harry would\u2019ve done anything to protect her, and she would\u2019ve kicked his ass when he was a jerk.

I\u2019ll go then.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d It didn\u2019t feel weird with Lottie. It was a normal thing that day have some common things. Harry loved her as a friend. Your friend. And Lottie has always been a huge fan of Louis and Niall, not Harry, so you weren\u2019t afraid of her stealing your boy. But was him your boy any more? You need to find that out. When you got back, Lottie went to eat with Harry and you were in your room reading. She came back after two hours. </p><p>\u201cHey! I thought you\u2019re asleep\u201d she said as she walked in. </p><p>\u201cNo, I never sleep before midnight. It\u2019s a side effect of touring. The concerts always end later. How was the evening?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt was really good, we caught up on things and I had to tell everything about my pregnancy. He even asked me if he can hold my belly\u201d </p><p>\u201cDid you let him?\u201d You chuckled. </p><p>\u201cYeah, he was too nice. But it\u2019s not that big yet so there\u2019s not too much to hold actually.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he enjoyed it though.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe did.\u201d you two giggled.</p><p>The next day you got a message from Jeff. </p><p>\u201c5SOS will visit today. Can you give them a tour?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat the heck?\u201d you mumbled to yourself. You havent met them, but Harry told you earlier that Luke has a thing for you. Jeff didn\u2019t tell you, but Harry was also asked to get them around. So when you get to the back door at the given time you found Harry. </p><p>\u201cOh, hey!\u201d </p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d he waved awkwardly. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re waiting for them?\u201d You asked and realized how dumb this question was, but at least it saved you from a more awkward silence. </p><p>\u201cYeah, Jeff asked me to do a tour for them,\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cWhat? Jeff asked me too for that,\u201d you were surprised. </p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess we can split up, so we don\u2019t have to go all together,\u201d you suggested. </p><p>\u201cYeah, sure, we can totally split from each other, I mean in this, touring \u2026.them, you know\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, totally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeeeeey!\u201d You heard someone open the door. It was Ash. They all hugged you and you told them that the tour with be split up and they seemed to be very happy about it. Luke and Ash specifically chose to go with you. </p><p>Luke and Ashton followed you as you started to talk about your work and the tour. Harry, Michael and Calum stayed behind in a seeing distance. </p><p>\u201cSo why didn\u2019t you chose them to get a great behind the curtain show by y/n?\u201d Harry asked them. Calum started to explain. </p><p>\u201cThe thing is. They both have a crush on her. And now they\u2019re both trying to impress her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe made bets, which one of them takes her on a date\u201d Michael added. Harry\u2019s eyes went wide open. That was the last thing he wanted to hear. But he needed to be chill.</p><p>\u201cAnd what if she doesn\u2019t pick?\u201d Harry asked. </p><p>\u201cOh, she will. Ashton said, if she doesn\u2019t seem to choose him, he\u2019s gonna kiss her or something. You know\u2026 to get overwhelmed by him\u201d they laughed. Harry didn\u2019t. </p><p>\u201c\u2026so we became good friends fast, which makes easier to work with him\u201d you said. </p><p>\u201cDo you have a boyfriend?\u201d Luke asked. You got nervous. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business.\u201d you said. Ashton smirked. </p><p>\u201cLuke, don\u2019t be an ass. She\u2019s a lady. You don\u2019t ask that from a lady like this\u201d he said and wrapped his arm around your shoulder. </p><p>\u201cAnd how do you like the work so far?\u201d Ashton asked. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll, that\u2019s a question I\u2019m gonna answer. I love it, the band, the crew, the audience are amazing\u2026\u201d you went on talking about your work. Harry hissed when he saw that Ashton\u2019s arm is around your shoulder and soon it was on your waist. The boys saw that he\u2019s intense. </p><p>\u201cWhy are you pissed, Harry? I can see it on you\u201d Michael said. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 I don\u2019t want anyone to hit on her\u201d he admitted. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, bro. They\u2019re all single adults. You\u2019re not her dad anyway. You act like that\u201d he chuckled. \u201cBut she\u2019s mine\u201d Harry thought. </p><p>\u201cMan, she\u2019s gonna go home with one of them tonight\u201d Calum said. Harry wasn\u2019t so happy, but tried to take it as a joke. Your relationship wasn\u2019t that strong at the moment. He trusted you, but he didn\u2019t trust the boys. </p><p>You had to go back to your dressing room to finish some paperwork for Jeff. Harry was with the boys and the band. Ten minutes into the chatting, he realized Luke has gone missing. </p><p>You sat by the table in your room when someone knocked on the door. </p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d you saw Luke peeking his head inside. \u201cCan I come in?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d you smiled. </p><p>\u201cI just forgot to say that we saw the little video you made, when you covered Lie to Me with Mitch and Sarah\u201d he smiled as he sat down on the chair next to you. </p><p>\u201cThanks! It was really just a little fun. But. I felt that song so much at that time, it screamed for being covered\u201d you chuckled. </p><p>\u201cYou changed the lyrics even\u201d he leaned a bit closer. </p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d you were cut off saying anything because he put his lips on yours and started kissing you. His hand was on your cheek fast as he tried to deepen the kiss. You pulled away. </p><p>\u201cSorry. That was fast\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to kiss when someone else is on your mind\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh. I see. So you have a boyfriend\u201d </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t confirm nor deny. It\u2019s complicated\u201d you chuckled. \u201cBut I wanna keep a promise to someone\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course. And sorry for attacking you\u201d </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s forget this, okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay\u201d he said and Harry opened the door without knocking.</p><p>\u201cThere you are, Luke. You escaped so quietly.\u201d Harry said. </p><p>\u201cYeah, I just wanted to compliment y/n\u2019s cover of Lie to Me. I love it,\u201d Luke said. </p><p>\u201cGuys are missing you, we still have a stack of beer to have,\u201d Luke stood up and Harry waited until he left the room. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in a minute,\u201d he shouted after him and closed the door. </p><p>\u201cYou alright?\u201d He asked you. </p><p>\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d You smiled. </p><p>\u201cI stood by the door for a while before I came in,\u201d he admitted and looked down. </p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWas it uh\u2026. Nevermind.\u201d He said and turned around to leave. </p><p>\u201cYes, it was you.\u201d You said quickly. He looked at you and smiled. It was sad, but it was true. </p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said and left. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"333\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"harryisart:828Fkt7aWPy-M0QbCpeDWA:Z0Qutt2gZWiHl\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/96d224424f136c9d465f7ec8c251a22e/tumblr_pno424I4gQ1rk9xsjo1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"333\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"sailorssouls:koG7DU10v1h3hwcxAH41bw:Z7Lnsb2ZHLXNa\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0eafdc8abdc4999087df3cf6bd57cfc3/tumblr_pazslskcul1wk8ulgo2_r1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"278\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"hampsteadharry:UOQFCE-vL00C7mDHsxVCEw:ZuGAvl2ZGdKHd\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aef22961454a0322bfe94661cac8aad1/tumblr_paz0d23u1r1u4m4fxo2_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"278\"></figure><p>Later the same routine was done, you got your matching clothes, took some pictures with Harry and he left for the concert.

So when you get to the back door at the given time you found Harry. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, hey!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; he waved awkwardly. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re waiting for them?&rdquo; You asked and realized how dumb this question was, but at least it saved you from a more awkward silence. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, Jeff asked me to do a tour for them,&rdquo; he said. </p><p>&ldquo;What? Jeff asked me too for that,&rdquo; you were surprised. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess we can split up, so we don&rsquo;t have to go all together,&rdquo; you suggested. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, sure, we can totally split from each other, I mean in this, touring &hellip;.them, you know&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, totally.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Heeeeey!&rdquo; You heard someone open the door. It was Ash. They all hugged you and you told them that the tour with be split up and they seemed to be very happy about it. Luke and Ash specifically chose to go with you. </p><p>Luke and Ashton followed you as you started to talk about your work and the tour. Harry, Michael and Calum stayed behind in a seeing distance. </p><p>&ldquo;So why didn&rsquo;t you chose them to get a great behind the curtain show by y/n?&rdquo; Harry asked them. Calum started to explain. </p><p>&ldquo;The thing is. They both have a crush on her. And now they&rsquo;re both trying to impress her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We made bets, which one of them takes her on a date&rdquo; Michael added. Harry&rsquo;s eyes went wide open. That was the last thing he wanted to hear. But he needed to be chill.</p><p>&ldquo;And what if she doesn&rsquo;t pick?&rdquo; Harry asked. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, she will. Ashton said, if she doesn&rsquo;t seem to choose him, he&rsquo;s gonna kiss her or something. You know&hellip; to get overwhelmed by him&rdquo; they laughed. Harry didn&rsquo;t. </p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;so we became good friends fast, which makes easier to work with him&rdquo; you said. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you have a boyfriend?&rdquo; Luke asked. You got nervous. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s none of your business.&rdquo; you said. Ashton smirked. </p><p>&ldquo;Luke, don&rsquo;t be an ass. She&rsquo;s a lady. You don&rsquo;t ask that from a lady like this&rdquo; he said and wrapped his arm around your shoulder. </p><p>&ldquo;And how do you like the work so far?&rdquo; Ashton asked. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll, that&rsquo;s a question I&rsquo;m gonna answer. I love it, the band, the crew, the audience are amazing&hellip;&rdquo; you went on talking about your work. Harry hissed when he saw that Ashton&rsquo;s arm is around your shoulder and soon it was on your waist. The boys saw that he&rsquo;s intense. </p><p>&ldquo;Why are you pissed, Harry? I can see it on you&rdquo; Michael said. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want anyone to hit on her&rdquo; he admitted. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, bro. They&rsquo;re all single adults. You&rsquo;re not her dad anyway. You act like that&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;But she&rsquo;s mine&rdquo; Harry thought. </p><p>&ldquo;Man, she&rsquo;s gonna go home with one of them tonight&rdquo; Calum said. Harry wasn&rsquo;t so happy, but tried to take it as a joke. Your relationship wasn&rsquo;t that strong at the moment. He trusted you, but he didn&rsquo;t trust the boys. </p><p>You had to go back to your dressing room to finish some paperwork for Jeff. Harry was with the boys and the band. Ten minutes into the chatting, he realized Luke has gone missing. </p><p>You sat by the table in your room when someone knocked on the door. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; you saw Luke peeking his head inside. &ldquo;Can I come in?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&rdquo; you smiled. </p><p>&ldquo;I just forgot to say that we saw the little video you made, when you covered Lie to Me with Mitch and Sarah&rdquo; he smiled as he sat down on the chair next to you. </p><p>&ldquo;Thanks! It was really just a little fun. But. I felt that song so much at that time, it screamed for being covered&rdquo; you chuckled. </p><p>&ldquo;You changed the lyrics even&rdquo; he leaned a bit closer. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; you were cut off saying anything because he put his lips on yours and started kissing you. His hand was on your cheek fast as he tried to deepen the kiss. You pulled away. </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry. That was fast&rdquo; he said. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to kiss when someone else is on your mind&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh. I see. So you have a boyfriend&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t confirm nor deny. It&rsquo;s complicated&rdquo; you chuckled. &ldquo;But I wanna keep a promise to someone&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Of course. And sorry for attacking you&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s forget this, okay?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Okay&rdquo; he said and Harry opened the door without knocking.</p><p>&ldquo;There you are, Luke. You escaped so quietly.&rdquo; Harry said. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I just wanted to compliment y/n&rsquo;s cover of Lie to Me. I love it,&rdquo; Luke said. </p><p>&ldquo;Guys are missing you, we still have a stack of beer to have,&rdquo; Luke stood up and Harry waited until he left the room. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there in a minute,&rdquo; he shouted after him and closed the door. </p><p>&ldquo;You alright?&rdquo; He asked you. </p><p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I be?&rdquo; You smiled. </p><p>&ldquo;I stood by the door for a while before I came in,&rdquo; he admitted and looked down. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yeah, I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Was it uh&hellip;. Nevermind.&rdquo; He said and turned around to leave. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, it was you.&rdquo; You said quickly. He looked at you and smiled. It was sad, but it was true. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said and left. </p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"1\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"2\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>Later the same routine was done, you got your matching clothes, took some pictures with Harry and he left for the concert. Lottie was out in the crowd tonight, but you didn&rsquo;t go with her.&nbsp;</p><p>Harry found not just one, but two pregnant women in the crowd. She was talking to one, but couldn&rsquo;t miss to mention Lottie. Luckily he found her. He was the sweetest guy for her. He made her feel special and important in front of thousands of people. You actually loved their friendship, like they were brother and sister. Harry would&rsquo;ve done anything to protect her, and she would&rsquo;ve kicked his ass when he was a jerk. They didn&rsquo;t have romance, they had a pure friendship. \n\n</p><p>You were thinking about what happened and got lost in thoughts when someone hugged you from behind. You almost jumped and turned around.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey! Sorry for scaring you,&rdquo; Louis said. </p><p>&ldquo;Louis!&rdquo; you hugged him. You were happy he&rsquo;s there. &ldquo;How can you be here? Shouldn&rsquo;t you be in London doing the X-Factor?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Auditions are done and I had some free time. Where&rsquo;s Lottie?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Out somewhere. Wanna find her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I hear it&rsquo;s Kiwi now, I&rsquo;ll wait until she&rsquo;s back.&rdquo;</p><p>When the concert ended, the boys went out all together but you decided to stay in the hotel. </p>",
