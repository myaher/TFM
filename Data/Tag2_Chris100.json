your nails into yet again. \u00a0</p><p>As your wrist began to throb with pain and the dark memories\nsoon fading from your mind, you shut your eyes, utterly exhausted and slipped\ninto a deep slumber. \u00a0</p><p>~~~</p><p>You were unsure of the time when you woke up, but the sky\nwas still dark and your neck ached from the position you had fallen asleep\nit. \u00a0Sluggishly, you got yourself up into\na sitting position before all the memories came flooding back to you again,\nmaking you want to scream in agony, but you held back. \u00a0</p><p>It felt as though you hadn\u2019t had any water in months, your\nthroat hoarse and raw as you made your way to the kitchen for a glass of\nwater. \u00a0Upon opening the door, you peeked\nyour head out, but heard nothing but quiet. \n</p><p>Not wanting to wake anyone up and have them badgering you\nwith questions, you silently crept to the kitchen only to be caught off guard\nwith three pairs of eyes trained on you from the couch. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re up,\u201d Chris spoke with such eagerness as his eyes\nlanded on you. \u00a0</p><p>Without so much as a glance, you turned and grabbed a glass\nfrom the cabinet before filling it with the water from the faucet. \u00a0 Placing the glass to your lips, you leaned\nyour head back and took a big gulp, relishing in the feel of the cool liquid on\nyour parched throat. \u00a0</p><p>Setting the cup back down, you didn\u2019t dare turn your back to\nlook at them; deciding to head back to the bedroom instead and shutting the\ndoor. \u00a0</p><p>You sat down on the edge of the bed as you felt the soreness\nof your wrist. \u00a0Placing your left wrist\npalm up, you had to fight back the tears as you realized what you had done to\nyourself. \u00a0It was a step backwards, that\nmuch you knew. \u00a0</p><p>There was a knock on the door and before you could pull the\nsleeve of your shirt down, Chris walked in. \nHis eyes immediately went to your wrist, which was cradled in your other\nhand. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cErica, what did you do?\u201d he asked with such worry in his\nvoice as he rushed to your side. \u00a0</p><p>Guilt immediately fluttered throughout your body as Chris\ntook your wrist in his hands carefully, inspecting the damage. \u00a0He tore his gaze from your red swollen wrist\nand up to your eyes. \u00a0</p><p>After the guilt began to fade, you started feeling anger;\nand lots of it. \u00a0Pulling your wrist out\nof his grasp, you go to your feet. \u00a0\u201cI\nwas dealing with it,\u201d you snapped. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDealing with it? \u00a0Are\nyou kidding me Erica? \u00a0THAT,\u201d he said\npointing to your wrist, \u201cis NOT dealing with it. \u00a0It\u2019s taking a selfish road instead of the\nright road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelfish? \nSELFISH? \u00a0Are you sure you want to\nbe calling ME selfish at this point Chris? \nYOU are the one that decided to withhold all this important information\nfrom me knowing FULL well that I DESERVED to know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI WAS JUST DOING WHAT THE DOCTOR ASKED ME TO DO!\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Chris wasn\u2019t the one to normally yell, especially at you and\nyou were taken aback at his harsh tone. \nShaking your head, you grabbed your purse off the bed and walked out of\nthe bedroom; Chris quickly following your footsteps. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cErica where are you going?\u201d</p><p>Halting your steps, you turned to face him as tears streaked\nyour face. \u00a0\u201cYou want selfish Chris?\nFine. \u00a0You and I, we are OVER! \u00a0I\u2019m going to the hotel, packing my shit, and\ntaking the next flight back to L.A.\u201d</p><p>Chris didn\u2019t even say anything as he stared at you, stunned\nwhile you slammed the door closed. \u00a0It\ntook him a minute to realize what just happened before he began to march\ntowards the front door. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cChris don\u2019t,\u201d Sebastian said, having heard everything. \u00a0Chris turned to see him and Margarita\nstanding in the hallway. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave her alone right now. \u00a0You both know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go to her,\u201d Margarita spoke up, walking towards\nChris. \u00a0</p><p>Chris let out a deep sigh, letting his head bow down at\neverything that had transpired in the last 24 hours. \u00a0He reached into back pocket, taking out his\nwallet and producing the hotel room card. \n\u201cRoom 713,\u201d was all he said before Margarita grabbed her purse and\nheaded out the door. \u00a0</p><p>~~~</p><p>Her steps were quick, knowing she didn\u2019t want to leave Erica\nalone for long at all as she made her way into the hotel lobby. \u00a0\u201cCome on, come on,\u201d she whispered as she\nwaited for the elevator doors to open. \nHer hands fidgeted together and she let out a sigh once the doors slid\nopen. \u00a0She tapped on the 7<sup>th</sup>\nfloor button as she paced back and forth in the elevator. \u00a0</p><p>She knew the entire story of what happened to Erica after\nshe lost her mother, and her baby. \u00a0She\nknew the lengths Erica would, and could go to. \nAs the doors slid open, she raced along the hallway until she stopped in\nfront of room 713. \u00a0</p><p>Knocking quickly, she looked around and noticed she was\nalone in the hallway. \u00a0\u201cErica open up\nsweetie. \u00a0It\u2019s just me, Margie.\u201d \u00a0The door didn\u2019t open as she began to knock\ninsistently again. \u00a0\u201cErica please open\nthe door.\u201d \u00a0Her heart began to race and\njust as she reached for her cell to call Sebastian, the door opened up. \u00a0</p><p>There stood Erica, eyes red as tears streaked her face. \u00a0\u201cWhat have I done Margie?\u201d </p><p style=\"\">Tag List:\u00a0\n\n<i><a

Chris, you go for a drive and get into a\nterrible accident. \u00a0Upon waking up in the\nhospital, you find both Sebastian and Chris sitting there. \u00a0The only problem? \u00a0You have no recent memories and you think you\nare still dating Sebastian.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Days. \u00a0That was how\nlong it felt like to make the trek back to Sebastian\u2019s apartment. \u00a0But in reality it must have only been a\nfifteen minute walk. \u00a0The longest fifteen\nminutes of your life. \u00a0The tension was\nthick between the four of you as you walked behind Sebastian and Margarita;\nChris glued to your side albeit not touching you in any way. \u00a0He wanted to comfort you, but not coddle\nyou. \u00a0He had been through this before;\nthis much you knew. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go and lie down,\u201d you mumbled as your feet\nmanaged to walk you through the door of the apartment. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you want me\u2026.,\u201d Chris started to say but you cut him\noff. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI just want to be alone right now.\u201d</p><p>You felt three pairs of eyes on you, and you didn\u2019t want\nthem to feel sorry for you; you didn\u2019t want their damn sympathy. \u00a0You just wanted to lay down in bed and forget\nthis day ever happened. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be right here for you if you need anything sweetie,\u201d\nMargarita spoke softly as you managed to nod your head. \u00a0</p><p>~~~</p><p>As your head hit the pillow you couldn\u2019t hold back the tears\nas they rolled down your cheek and you relived more memories that appeared\nwhile you were at the bar earlier. \u00a0It\nwas the first memory you recalled after losing your memories; the memory where\nyou and Sebastian were fighting and he refused he tell you what had\nhappened. \u00a0</p><p><i>You were at a Mexican\nrestaurant, one that you and Sebastian frequented in NYC. \u00a0He ordered the burrito empanada, yet you were\nbarely there in your mindset. \u00a0Instead\nyou were reeling from what he had said earlier to you. \u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat did you mean\nearlier?\u201d you snapped after the waitress had left. \u00a0Sebastian sighed, lowering his gaze from\nyours. \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t look away from me Seb!\u201d</i></p><p><i>His eyes snapped up to\nmeet yours, they were soft, sorrowful even. \n\u201cYou know what I meant Erica,\u201d he admitted, giving you a pointed\nlook. \u00a0</i></p><p><i>You rolled your eyes,\nchugging your drink, just wanting to forget this night. \u00a0\u201cWhat, you think I\u2019m fucked up don\u2019t\nyou? \u00a0Ever since that night you think I\nneed to be locked up in an institution? \nWell guess what Seb, maybe you\u2019re right! \nMaybe I do need to be locked away forever!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\nmeant and you know it,\u201d he growled angrily, his eyes narrowing. \u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah, well it sure\nseemed like it,\u201d you scowled. \u00a0\u201cI mean,\nhow the fuck am I supposed to interpret what you said huh? \u00a0I fucking tried to KILL myself and then you\ngo and tell me that you want to send me to a goddamn psychiatric ward!\u201d \u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cErica, calm down,\nplease. \u00a0People are starting to look at\nus.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You scoffed, rolling\nyour eyes and took another sip of your drink. \n\u201cLet them fucking look Sebastian. \nI don\u2019t give a fuck.\u201d \u00a0Closing\nyour eyes, you concentrated on your racing heart and thoughts as your nails\npinched the soft tender skin of your wrists. \n</i></p><p>Using your hand to wipe the snot from your nose, you\ncouldn\u2019t help but notice the small circular scars that were scattered along\nboth of your wrists. \u00a0You hadn\u2019t noticed\nthem before, but now, as your memories became clear, you knew exactly how they\ngot there. </p><p>Without another thought, you pinched your left wrist with\nyour nails, reveling in the calm the pain brought you as it made you think of\nnothing but the pain; not the memories. \u00a0Blood\nbegan to seep from the wound as you pulled your hand away, finding fresh skin\nto sink your nails into yet again. \u00a0</p><p>As your wrist began to throb with pain and the dark memories\nsoon fading from your mind, you shut your eyes, utterly exhausted and slipped\ninto a deep slumber. \u00a0</p><p>~~~</p><p>You were unsure of the time when you woke up, but the sky\nwas still dark and your neck ached from the position you had fallen asleep\nit. \u00a0Sluggishly, you got yourself up into\na sitting position before all the memories came flooding back to you again,\nmaking you want to scream in agony, but you held back. \u00a0</p><p>It felt as though you hadn\u2019t had any water in months, your\nthroat hoarse and raw as you made your way to the kitchen for a glass of\nwater. \u00a0Upon opening the door, you peeked\nyour head out, but heard nothing but quiet. \n</p><p>Not wanting to wake anyone up and have them badgering you\nwith questions, you silently crept to the kitchen only to be caught off guard\nwith three pairs of eyes trained on you from the couch. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re up,\u201d Chris spoke with such eagerness as his eyes\nlanded on you. \u00a0</p><p>Without so much as a glance, you turned and grabbed a glass\nfrom the cabinet before filling it with the water from the faucet. \u00a0 Placing the glass to your lips, you leaned\nyour head back and took a big gulp, relishing in the feel of the cool liquid on\nyour parched throat. \u00a0</p><p>Setting the cup back down, you didn\u2019t dare turn your back to\nlook at them; deciding to head back to the bedroom instead and shutting the\ndoor. \u00a0</p><p>You sat down on the edge of the bed as you felt the soreness\nof your wrist. \u00a0Placing your left wrist\npalm up, you had to fight back the tears as you realized what you had done to\nyourself. \u00a0It was a step backwards, that\nmuch you knew. \u00a0</p><p>There was a knock on the door and before you could pull the\nsleeve of your shirt down, Chris walked in. \nHis eyes immediately went to your wrist, which was cradled in your other\nhand. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cErica, what did you do?\u201d he asked with such worry in his\nvoice as he rushed to your side. \u00a0</p><p>Guilt immediately fluttered throughout your body as Chris\ntook your wrist in his hands carefully, inspecting the damage. \u00a0He tore his gaze from your red swollen wrist\nand up to your eyes. \u00a0</p><p>After the guilt began to fade, you started feeling anger;\nand lots of it. \u00a0Pulling your wrist out\nof his grasp, you go to your feet. \u00a0\u201cI\nwas dealing with it,\u201d you snapped. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDealing with it? \u00a0Are\nyou kidding me Erica? \u00a0THAT,\u201d he said\npointing to your wrist, \u201cis NOT dealing with it. \u00a0It\u2019s taking a selfish road instead of the\nright road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelfish? \nSELFISH? \u00a0Are you sure you want to\nbe calling ME selfish at this point Chris? \nYOU are the one that decided to withhold all this important information\nfrom me knowing FULL well that I DESERVED to know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI WAS JUST DOING WHAT THE DOCTOR ASKED ME TO DO!\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Chris wasn\u2019t the one to normally yell, especially at you

where are you going?\u201d</p><p>Halting your steps, you turned to face him as tears streaked\nyour face. \u00a0\u201cYou want selfish Chris?\nFine. \u00a0You and I, we are OVER! \u00a0I\u2019m going to the hotel, packing my shit, and\ntaking the next flight back to L.A.\u201d</p><p>Chris didn\u2019t even say anything as he stared at you, stunned\nwhile you slammed the door closed. \u00a0It\ntook him a minute to realize what just happened before he began to march\ntowards the front door. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cChris don\u2019t,\u201d Sebastian said, having heard everything. \u00a0Chris turned to

walking towards\nChris. \u00a0</p><p>Chris let out a deep sigh, letting his head bow down at\neverything that had transpired in the last 24 hours. \u00a0He reached into back pocket, taking out his\nwallet and producing the hotel room card. \n\u201cRoom 713,\u201d was all he said before Margarita grabbed her purse and\nheaded out the door. \u00a0</p><p>~~~</p><p>Her steps were quick, knowing

you mumbled as your feet\nmanaged to walk you through the door of the apartment. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want me&hellip;.,&rdquo; Chris started to say but you cut him\noff. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I just want to be alone right now.&rdquo;</p><p>You felt three pairs of eyes on you, and you didn&rsquo;t want\nthem to feel sorry for you; you didn&rsquo;t want their damn sympathy. &nbsp;You just wanted to lay down in bed and forget\nthis day ever happened. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be right here for you if you need anything sweetie,&rdquo;\nMargarita spoke softly as you managed to nod your head. &nbsp;</p><p>~~~</p><p>As your head hit the pillow you couldn&rsquo;t hold back the tears\nas they rolled down your cheek and you relived more memories that appeared\nwhile you were at the bar earlier. &nbsp;It\nwas the first memory you recalled after losing your memories; the memory where\nyou and Sebastian were fighting and he refused he tell you what had\nhappened. &nbsp;</p><p><i>You were at a Mexican\nrestaurant, one that you and Sebastian frequented in NYC. &nbsp;He ordered the burrito empanada, yet you were\nbarely there in your mindset. &nbsp;Instead\nyou were reeling from what he had said earlier to you. &nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What did you mean\nearlier?&rdquo; you snapped after the waitress had left. &nbsp;Sebastian sighed, lowering his gaze from\nyours. &nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look away from me Seb!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>His eyes snapped up to\nmeet yours, they were soft, sorrowful even. \n&ldquo;You know what I meant Erica,&rdquo; he admitted, giving you a pointed\nlook. &nbsp;</i></p><p><i>You rolled your eyes,\nchugging your drink, just wanting to forget this night. &nbsp;&ldquo;What, you think I&rsquo;m fucked up don&rsquo;t\nyou? &nbsp;Ever since that night you think I\nneed to be locked up in an institution? \nWell guess what Seb, maybe you&rsquo;re right! \nMaybe I do need to be locked away forever!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I\nmeant and you know it,&rdquo; he growled angrily, his eyes narrowing. &nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yeah, well it sure\nseemed like it,&rdquo; you scowled. &nbsp;&ldquo;I mean,\nhow the fuck am I supposed to interpret what you said huh? &nbsp;I fucking tried to KILL myself and then you\ngo and tell me that you want to send me to a goddamn psychiatric ward!&rdquo; &nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Erica, calm down,\nplease. &nbsp;People are starting to look at\nus.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You scoffed, rolling\nyour eyes and took another sip of your drink. \n&ldquo;Let them fucking look Sebastian. \nI don&rsquo;t give a fuck.&rdquo; &nbsp;Closing\nyour eyes, you concentrated on your racing heart and thoughts as your nails\npinched the soft tender skin of your wrists. \n</i></p><p>Using your hand to wipe the snot from your nose, you\ncouldn&rsquo;t help but notice the small circular scars that were scattered along\nboth of your wrists. &nbsp;You hadn&rsquo;t noticed\nthem before, but now, as your memories became clear, you knew exactly how they\ngot there. </p><p>Without another thought, you pinched your left wrist with\nyour nails, reveling in the calm the pain brought you as it made you think of\nnothing but the pain; not the memories. &nbsp;Blood\nbegan to seep from the wound as you pulled your hand away, finding fresh skin\nto sink your nails into yet again. &nbsp;</p><p>As your wrist began to throb with pain and the dark memories\nsoon fading from your mind, you shut your eyes, utterly exhausted and slipped\ninto a deep slumber. &nbsp;</p><p>~~~</p><p>You were unsure of the time when you woke up, but the sky\nwas still dark and your neck ached from the position you had fallen asleep\nit. &nbsp;Sluggishly, you got yourself up into\na sitting position before all the memories came flooding back to you again,\nmaking you want to scream in agony, but you held back. &nbsp;</p><p>It felt as though you hadn&rsquo;t had any water in months, your\nthroat hoarse and raw as you made your way to the kitchen for a glass of\nwater. &nbsp;Upon opening the door, you peeked\nyour head out, but heard nothing but quiet. \n</p><p>Not wanting to wake anyone up and have them badgering you\nwith questions, you silently crept to the kitchen only to be caught off guard\nwith three pairs of eyes trained on you from the couch. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re up,&rdquo; Chris spoke with such eagerness as his eyes\nlanded on you. &nbsp;</p><p>Without so much as a glance, you turned and grabbed a glass\nfrom the cabinet before filling it with the water from the faucet. &nbsp; Placing the glass to your lips, you leaned\nyour head back and took a big gulp, relishing in the feel of the cool liquid on\nyour parched throat. &nbsp;</p><p>Setting the cup back down, you didn&rsquo;t dare turn your back to\nlook at them; deciding to head back to the bedroom instead and shutting the\ndoor. &nbsp;</p><p>You sat down on the edge of the bed as you felt the soreness\nof your wrist. &nbsp;Placing your left wrist\npalm up, you had to fight back the tears as you realized what you had done to\nyourself. &nbsp;It was a step backwards, that\nmuch you knew. &nbsp;</p><p>There was a knock on the door and before you could pull the\nsleeve of your shirt down, Chris walked in. \nHis eyes immediately went to your wrist, which was cradled in your other\nhand. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Erica, what did you do?&rdquo; he asked with such worry in his\nvoice as he rushed to your side. &nbsp;</p><p>Guilt immediately fluttered throughout your body as Chris\ntook your wrist in his hands carefully, inspecting the damage. &nbsp;He tore his gaze from your red swollen wrist\nand up to your eyes. &nbsp;</p><p>After the guilt began to fade, you started feeling anger;\nand lots of it. &nbsp;Pulling your wrist out\nof his grasp, you go to your feet. &nbsp;&ldquo;I\nwas dealing with it,&rdquo; you snapped. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Dealing with it? &nbsp;Are\nyou kidding me Erica? &nbsp;THAT,&rdquo; he said\npointing to your wrist, &ldquo;is NOT dealing with it. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s taking a selfish road instead of the\nright road.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Selfish? \nSELFISH? &nbsp;Are you sure you want to\nbe calling ME selfish at this point Chris? \nYOU are the one that decided to withhold all this important information\nfrom me knowing FULL well that I DESERVED to know!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I WAS JUST DOING WHAT THE DOCTOR ASKED ME TO DO!&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>Chris wasn&rsquo;t the one to normally yell, especially at you and\nyou were taken aback at his harsh tone. \nShaking your head, you grabbed your purse off the bed and walked out of\nthe bedroom; Chris quickly following your footsteps. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Erica where are you going?&rdquo;</p><p>Halting your steps, you turned to face him as tears streaked\nyour face. &nbsp;&ldquo;You want selfish Chris?\nFine. &nbsp;You and I, we are OVER! &nbsp;I&rsquo;m going to the hotel, packing my shit, and\ntaking the next flight back to L.A.&rdquo;</p><p>Chris didn&rsquo;t even say anything as he stared at you, stunned\nwhile you slammed the door closed. &nbsp;It\ntook him a minute to realize what just happened before he began to march\ntowards the front door. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Chris don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Sebastian said, having heard everything. &nbsp;Chris turned to see him and Margarita\nstanding in the hallway. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t leave her alone right now. &nbsp;You both know that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to her,&rdquo; Margarita spoke up, walking towards\nChris. &nbsp;</p><p>Chris let out a deep sigh, letting his head bow down at\neverything that had transpired in the last 24 hours. &nbsp;He reached into back pocket, taking out his\nwallet and producing the hotel room card. \n&ldquo;Room 713,&rdquo; was all he said before Margarita grabbed her purse and\nheaded out the door. &nbsp;</p><p>~~~</p><p>Her steps were quick, knowing she didn&rsquo;t want to leave Erica\nalone for long at all as she made her way into the hotel lobby. &nbsp;&ldquo;Come on, come on,&rdquo; she whispered as she\nwaited for the elevator doors to open. \nHer hands fidgeted together and she let out a sigh once the doors slid\nopen. &nbsp;She tapped on the 7<sup>th</sup>\nfloor button as she paced back and forth in the elevator. &nbsp;</p><p>She knew the entire story of what happened to Erica after\nshe lost her mother, and her baby. &nbsp;She\nknew the lengths Erica would, and could go to. \nAs the doors slid open, she raced along the hallway until she stopped in\nfront of room 713. &nbsp;</p><p>Knocking quickly, she looked around and noticed she was\nalone in the hallway. &nbsp;&ldquo;Erica open up\nsweetie. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s just me, Margie.&rdquo; &nbsp;The door didn&rsquo;t open as she began to knock\ninsistently again. &nbsp;&ldquo;Erica please open\nthe door.&rdquo; &nbsp;Her heart began to race and\njust as she reached for her cell to call Sebastian, the door opened up. &nbsp;</p><p>There stood Erica, eyes red as tears streaked her face. &nbsp;&ldquo;What have I done Margie?&rdquo;

The Blackmail. It had started a couple of weeks back, after you and Steve were on a mission to take down a HYDRA base in Europe.

It had continued to say that the person knew that you were dating Steve and were best friends with the rest of The Avengers. You wanted to tell Steve and the others about the emails, but it said that if you told any of them that they would kill you and everyone you love, including Steve. You&rsquo;ve figured the emails were from HYDRA because in every single one they would threaten you and the others and the only people that do want to destroy/kill the Avengers is HYDRA.</p><p>Today was the worst email you had gotten so far&hellip; And if you don&rsquo;t do what the person told you to do they will capture you and Steve and then kill Steve in front of you.

You know that they would protect you if you do. But you also know that if you do, HYDRA will kill them and then kill you even if they protect you. Plus, if you don&rsquo;t break up with Steve HYDRA will release information about you that the rest of the Avengers don&rsquo;t even know about you.
