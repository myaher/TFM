The truth is Sansa\u2019s aim every time she told people she loved Joffrey wasn\u2019t to make them believe her because it\u2019s hard to believe, it was to avoid violence and unwanted attention.

So long as they keep to themselves we let them spin their little webs, but if they get underfoot we step on them.&rdquo; She patted Sansa on the back of the hand. &ldquo;Now, child, the truth.

A shiver went through her. &ldquo;A monster,&rdquo; she whispered, so tremulously she could scarcely hear her own voice. &ldquo;Joffrey is a monster. He lied about the butcher&rsquo;s boy and made Father kill my wolf. When I displease him, he has the Kingsguard beat me. He&rsquo;s evil and cruel, my lady, it&rsquo;s so. And the queen as well.&rdquo;</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell and her granddaughter exchanged a look. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the old woman, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a pity.&rdquo;\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>I was thinking about this scene and how someone described it as Sansa being manipulated which it sorta is but I see it more as a choice.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nBut this was the Red Keep, this was King&rsquo;s Landing, this was the court of King Joffrey Baratheon, the First of His Name, and if there was one thing that Sansa Stark had learned here, it was mistrust.\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>Sansa has spent a long time isolated in King&rsquo;s Landing until the Tyrells show up with the intention of marrying Sansa to Willas. They offered friendship, sisterhood and escape from Joffrey. However when the questions came, Olenna wasn&rsquo;t been gentle and skillful with them. She was rather forceful, Sansa was surprised at how the questions came out of nowhere and she answered them as she usually did with some stuttering and hesitation. The truth is Sansa&rsquo;s aim every time she told people she loved Joffrey wasn&rsquo;t to make them believe her because it&rsquo;s hard to believe, it was to avoid violence and unwanted attention. Sansa in this scene wasn&rsquo;t trying to convince anyone, she was making sure she never got in trouble.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nShe stopped abruptly, and covered her mouth. I&rsquo;ve said too much, oh gods be good, they&rsquo;ll know, they&rsquo;ll hear, someone will tell on me.\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>That&rsquo;s why Sansa telling them this</p><blockquote><p>\n\n&ldquo;Joffrey,&rdquo; Sansa said. &ldquo;Joffrey did that. He promised me he would be merciful, and cut my father&rsquo;s head off. He said that was mercy, and he took me up on the walls and made me look at it. The head. He wanted me to weep, but &hellip;&rdquo;\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>was different. She let some of Joffrey&rsquo;s cruelties slip until she remembered where she was, in Joffrey&rsquo;s castle.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\n\nThe wrinkled old lady smiled. &ldquo;At Highgarden we have many spiders amongst the flowers. So long as they keep to themselves we let them spin their little webs, but if they get underfoot we step on them.&rdquo; She patted Sansa on the back of the hand. &ldquo;Now, child, the truth. What sort of man is this Joffrey, who calls himself Baratheon but looks so very Lannister?&rdquo;\n\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;\n\nAND DOWN THE ROAD FROM HERE TO THERE. FROM HERE! TO THERE! THREE BOYS, A GOAT, AND A DANCING BEAR!&ldquo;\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>Once Sansa&rsquo;s biggest fear of being overheard was seemingly taken care of, she&rsquo;s left with the question of whether or not she should tell them the truth. After all they&rsquo;re tied to the Lannisters and she was a prisoner. There are so many ways this could go wrong for her. But Sansa imo made a brave choice.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nSansa felt as though her heart had lodged in her throat. The Queen of Thorns was so close she could smell the old woman&rsquo;s sour breath. Her gaunt thin fingers were pinching her wrist. To her other side, Margaery was listening as well. A shiver went through her. \"A monster,&rdquo; she whispered, so tremulously she could scarcely hear her own voice. &ldquo;Joffrey is a monster. He lied about the butcher&rsquo;s boy and made Father kill my wolf. When I displease him, he has the Kingsguard beat me. He&rsquo;s evil and cruel, my lady, it&rsquo;s so. And the queen as well.&rdquo;\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>A while ago she had been caught off guard by Joffrey so she decided to warn Margaery. It wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time that Sansa stepped up for other people despite her own fears. It&rsquo;s in Sansa&rsquo;s nature. So it was both manipulation and it was also Sansa&rsquo;s own initiative. I know this because she does it again.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nHow can I let my sister marry Joffrey? she thought, and suddenly her eyes were full of tears. &ldquo;Margaery, please,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; It was hard to get the words out. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t marry him. He&rsquo;s not like he seems, he&rsquo;s not. He&rsquo;ll hurt you.&rdquo;\n\n<br /></p></blockquote></p>",

        "question": "Why is it wrong for Sansa to demand loyalty from northern houses who have already sworn fealty to House Stark to help the Starks reclaim their home from the Boltons? The Boltons who helped kill thousands of northerners and even heirs to noble northern houses? But it's not wrong for Dany to arrive in Westeros and demand loyalty and knee bending from people who don't even know her? People who have suffered terribly, who suffered under the reign of her father, people who don't owe her anything?",
        "answer": "<p>Listen, anon who refuses to use their own blog name. I didn\u2019t say it was WRONG. Do you lack reading comprehension? I didn\u2019t say it was wrong. I said she did it imperiously, with no thought for how the Boltons cowed the entire North. Davos even warned her but she went ahead and assumed that every Northern house would gladly rally. They didn\u2019t. Glover was an asshole about it. I think the Northern houses were wrong, but they eventually rallied behind Sansa AND JON.</p><p>I said nothing about Daenerys. You are the one trying to get me to pit Sansa and Daenerys against each other. I have zero interest in doing that. The FACT is that Daenerys demanded exactly ONE family to kneel. The Tarly\u2019s. May I remind you that the Tarly\u2019s served House Tyrell, but when Cersei promised Randyll that he could be Warden of the West he betrayed his liege lord. <br/></p><p>\nBetrayed his liege lord just like House Bolton betrayed THEIR liege lord, House Stark. \n\n<br/></p><p>The smallfolk of Westeros did not suffer under the rule of Daenery\u2019 father. The people of King\u2019s Landing did that is true. They suffered far more, along with ALL of Westeros, from the War of Five Kings which happened many years after Aerys was overthrown. And Cersei has been making the people of King\u2019s Landing suffer quite a bit ever since her husband King Robert died. <br/></p><p>Why do you have such a problem with me criticizing Sansa? Are you aware (you surely are) that anti Dany folks, Sansa fans, and Jonsa fans all call Daenerys horrible names and heap TONS of rage on her. Not even criticism, RAGE. And they freely put it in her tag and then merrily tell her fans that object, that it\u2019s all okay. So deal with my criticism. <br/></p>",
