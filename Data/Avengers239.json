        "body": "<h1>Peter Parker/ Spider-Man - &ldquo;What the hell?!&rdquo; </h1><p>Your POV</p><p>That was awkward.</p><p>It were the last weeks of school. Everything should be good. But clumsy as I am I managed to run into Peter Parker. Nothing awkward with that, well not unnatural much, but we fell to the floor because he was running. We fell onto each other. That was weird even for someone like me. His face was inches away from mine and I could feel his breath against my cheek. Peter got up fast and cleared his throat. When he noticed I was still on the floor he quickly extended his hand and helped me up. I blushed as I felt a shiver going down my spine. Thanks to me for having a giant fricking crush on Peter Parker. &ldquo;Sorry, I didn&rsquo;t expect to crush on someone. I mean- to crash into someone. Oh my god, I&hellip;just&hellip;I&rsquo;ll just stop talking.&rdquo;, I mumbled. Peter smiled and shook my hand which he was surprisingly still holding. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Peter. Peter Parker.&rdquo;, he said. I nodded: &ldquo;I know.&rdquo; I took my hand from his. &ldquo;Okay, that sounded creepy.&rdquo; He shook his head. &ldquo;I have to go.&rdquo;, I said quickly. I turned around and to the school doors. &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;, I heard Peter yell after me. I turned to him again. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get your name.&rdquo;, he said walking towards me a bit. &ldquo;(Y/N).&rdquo;, I slightly smiled at thought that I talked to, actually talked to him, not just in my head. Or with my computer. Peter smiled genuinely at me and walked away. I walked out of the building and straight into a puddle. Lucky me. Happy would be there any minute.</p><p>The next day in PE I sat next to MJ who was reading a book. She took her books everywhere. <i>Stop complaining, you do that too. Yes, I have a book with me but I&rsquo;m not reading it right now.</i> I&rsquo;m the typical nerd. Good in school, always having the nose in a book, big glasses on a not so pretty face, skinny. <i>You are a nerd who is way too supernatural to be a typical nerd.</i> Yes, that too. I got some.. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s start with the training. Team up with a partner and start with push-ups. Continue with sit-ups.&rdquo;, the coach&rsquo;s voice startled me. MJ turned to me and asked if I would team up with her. &ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; </p><p>On my way to the mats someone bumped into me. &ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo;, Peter Parker said. &ldquo;No big deal.&rdquo;, I smiled and turned to MJ who had a curious look on her face. &ldquo;What is going on with your future husband?&rdquo;, my cheeks turned crimson red. &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;, I whisper-yelled. She grinned. &ldquo;Just start already.&rdquo;</p><p>I got onto the mat and started doing push-ups. Michelle started to look at me weird when I just continued. After 70 push-ups my arm muscles were burning. I got on my knees and took a deep breath. &ldquo;What was that? Nobody does 70 push-ups like it&rsquo;s nothing. Especially not you.&rdquo; I rolled my eyes. &ldquo;Why thank you for the boost of confidence. It&rsquo;s your turn.&rdquo; Michelle groaned and started but she laid flat after 20.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dying.&rdquo;, she groaned for the second time. I giggled. &ldquo;Get up and let me do the sit-ups. She obliged and held my feet to the ground while I was getting started. I couldn&rsquo;t resist overhearing a conversation.</p><p>&quot;Go talk to her.&rdquo;, someone said. &ldquo;No! She is way out of my league.&rdquo;, said Peter. So clearly it wasn&rsquo;t spoken about me. Sadly.</p><p>I continued with sit-ups until my stomach muscles were burning. I was exhausted. Soon the lesson was over and I followed MJ to the changing rooms. </p><p>In Physics I couldn&rsquo;t concentrate because 1. I was sitting behind Peter and 2. My powers started kicking in again. I just looked at the metal ball in front of me tapping my fingers against the table and soon the ball was a sheet. I gasped and grabbed it, hopefully fast enough. I couldn&rsquo;t wait for the afternoon with Wanda and training. </p><p>Oh yeah, I am a bender. I can control the elements plus blood, mind and metal. My powers surfaced when I was extremely pissed at Tony, for not asking me if I wanted to be adopted by him and Pepper. He did it anyways. Making me a Stark. (Y/N) Stark. </p><p>I didn&rsquo;t mind now. He was always kind of a father for me and he treated me as his own child. </p><p>The bell took me back to reality and I packed my stuff. I could see my veins in my arms turning crimson red. I rolled my sleeves down and speeded out of the room. I heard someone yell my name but I didn&rsquo;t listen. I ran to the bathrooms and looked into the mirror only to see my eyes turning white. I could still see but it was different. I had to get of here.</p><p>Before something worse happens.</p><p>I pulled my hood deep enough to cover the red fire like veins and the white eyes. I left the bathroom looking left and right to find nobody. I hurried to the exit only to be stopped in my tracks when I recognize Peter standing there waiting for me. &ldquo;Oh no. Not now.&rdquo;, I groaned quietly. &ldquo;Hey.&rdquo;, he said. I tried to not lift my head to his voice. I walked around him and out of the building.</p><p>I blinked a few times stumbling down the stairs to the street. &ldquo;Hey, easy there. Are you okay?&rdquo;, he tried to grab my arm and help me but I yanked it away. &ldquo;Do not touch me.&rdquo;, I said with gritted teeth. He backed away at the sight of my angry expression. He was scared. I didn&rsquo;t want to scare him. Not Peter. I blinked and got away quickly to the black SUV which was already waiting for me. Happy got out as he saw the state I was in. He opened the door for me.</p><p>On the way the Avengers Base I tried to calm down. I jumped right out of the car when I saw a Jet landing on the platform. It was dangerous for the people to be around me. I didn&rsquo;t want to hurt them. I already hurt Tony and Pepper once. I ran away back then and that&rsquo;s what I was intending to do now too. </p><p>But Bucky and Wanda were already there. Bucky grabbed my arms and Wanda tapped my forehead to put me to sleep. </p><p>Drenched in sweat I woke up again. Wanda sat in the armchair next to my bed and Bucky spoke quietly with Tony. &ldquo;Did I hurt anyone?&rdquo;, I asked with a hoarse voice. I need water. They all turned to me. Tony rushed to my side and grabbed my hand. &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;, he asked quietly. I smiled lightly and nodded. &ldquo;I just need some water.&rdquo; At that very moment Vision came through the wall with a big glass of water. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;, he smiled and stood behind Wanda. &ldquo;How are you, honey?&rdquo;, another voice said. Pepper. She kissed my forehead. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m better than \u2013 wait, what day is it?&rdquo;, I wrinkled my brows. Bucky answered: &ldquo;You were asleep for 5 days, (Y/N).&rdquo; I groaned. Not again. I could feel something going through my veins. I shivered but it didn&rsquo;t go away. I looked at my arms. The veins were red again. &ldquo;Leave.&rdquo;, I said. Pepper kissed my forehead one more time and Tony squeezed my hand and Bucky just nudged my leg. Wanda and Vision stayed and took my hands. I started to scream as the fire went through my body. I could feel it in my head, in my chest and even in my toes. Wanda and Vision tried their best to help me through this. At some point it all went black. </p><p>The next time I awoke it was from loud yelling. I opened my eyes and looked around in my room. I was alone. I sat up and got out of bed to follow the loud voices. They were downstairs.</p><p>&ldquo;No! I am not going to do this!&rdquo;, that was Tony. &ldquo;She is dangerous!&rdquo;, Steve Rogers. &ldquo;Just because you are not used to supernatural beings doesn&rsquo;t mean that they are not allowed to exist! You are intolerant! I thought your name was standing for Righteousness but I guess I was wrong!&rdquo;, Bucky. &ldquo;Guys, calm down! She can learn to control her powers! She is just at the beginning! Steve, give her a chance.&rdquo;, Natasha. I went downstairs but hid behind the corner. &ldquo;You do know what happened last time she lost control. She-&rdquo; I was deadly calm when I started to walk inside the room. They stared at me with wide eyes. &ldquo;She can speak for herself.&rdquo;, I said when I stood in front of Steve. Bruce came up to me and Steve. &ldquo;Steve, you gave me a chance. So why not her?&rdquo; Steve looked at his friend and nodded. &ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; </p><p>From this moment I never wanted to be in the same room as Steve. </p><p>~~~~~~</p><p>A few weeks later was my graduation. Tony, Pepper, Wanda, Bruce, Natasha and Thor came. They all clapped when I got my diploma.</p><p>When I headed to my family Peter came up to me. &ldquo;Hey.&rdquo;, he said cautiously. We hadn&rsquo;t talked since the incident in front of the school. &ldquo;Hi.&rdquo;, I responded. &ldquo;Uhm..I wanted to talk to you.&rdquo; I laughed a bit: &ldquo;Me too.&rdquo; He scratched the back of his neck. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what was up with you a few weeks ago but I don&rsquo;t care anymore. But I would be willing to find out. I uhm&hellip;like you and I want to get to know you. That sounds so weird. Uhm..&rdquo; I laughed a bit as we continued to walk towards Tony and the others. &ldquo;I actually wanted to apologize for what happened back then. I didn&rsquo;t have control&hellip;I&rsquo;m sorry. And oh, I like you too.&rdquo; <i>You love him, you idiot. We don&rsquo;t even know each other, you assbutt.</i></p><p>Peter wanted to say something whenTony decided to interrupt him: &ldquo;Oi, Spider-Boy. Don&rsquo;t touch my daughter!&rdquo;, he came with a grin at us and pointed his index finger at Peter. Spider-Boy? I rolled my eyes and thought about the term Tony used on Peter, as if they knew each other. Peter on the other hand was shocked. &ldquo;Daughter? You are Mr. Stark&rsquo;s daughter?&rdquo;, he went pale. &ldquo;Yes, she is. And don&rsquo;t even think about starting something. If I catch you even looking at her I swear-&rdquo; &ldquo;Dad!&rdquo;, I cut him off. Both looked at me. &ldquo;Dad?&rdquo;, they said in unison. I put my hand over my mouth. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the first time you ever said &lsquo;Dad&rsquo; to me.&rdquo; I could have sworn I saw a tear in his eye.</p><p>&ldquo;First: Yes, Peter, I am his daughter. Adoptive but well&hellip;I am his daughter. Second: Dad, you are not going to stop me if I want to spend time with Peter. And Third: Spider-Boy?&rdquo;</p><p>Dad smiled and put a hand on Peter&rsquo;s shoulder who was in fact still pale and quiet and afraid.</p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N), you joined the Avengers a few weeks ago when you learned how to control your powers.&rdquo;, Dad started but I cut him off again. &ldquo;Dad, what are-&rdquo; &ldquo;Let me speak, child.&rdquo; He grinned and looked at Peter. Peter looked at me with wide eyes. &ldquo;(Y/N), I want you to meet the newest member of the Avengers. Peter Parker aka Spider-Boy.&rdquo; &ldquo;Spider-Man. It&rsquo;s actually Spider-Man.&rdquo;, Peter whispered looking me in the eyes. I was shocked. &ldquo;What the hell?!&rdquo;</p>",

But clumsy as I am I managed to run into Peter Parker. Nothing awkward with that, well not unnatural much, but we fell to the floor because he was running. We fell onto each other. That was weird even for someone like me. His face was inches away from mine and I could feel his breath against my cheek. Peter got up fast and cleared his throat. When he noticed I was still on the floor he quickly extended his hand and helped me up. I blushed as I felt a shiver going down my spine. Thanks to me for having a giant fricking crush on Peter Parker. \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t expect to crush on someone. I mean- to crash into someone. Oh my god, I\u2026just\u2026I\u2019ll just stop talking.\u201d, I mumbled. Peter smiled and shook my hand which he was surprisingly still holding. \u201cI\u2019m Peter. Peter Parker.\u201d, he said. I nodded: \u201cI know.\u201d I took my hand from his. \u201cOkay, that sounded creepy.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI have to go.\u201d, I said quickly. I turned around and to the school doors. \u201cWait!\u201d, I heard Peter yell after me. I turned to him again. \u201cI didn\u2019t get your name.\u201d, he said walking towards me a bit. \u201c(Y/N).\u201d, I slightly smiled at thought that I talked to, actually talked to him, not just in my head. Or with my computer. Peter smiled genuinely at me and walked away. I walked out of the building and straight into a puddle. Lucky me. Happy would be there any minute.</p><p>The next day in PE I sat next to MJ who was reading a book. She took her books everywhere. <i>Stop complaining, you do that too. Yes, I have a book with me but I\u2019m not reading it right now.</i> I\u2019m the typical nerd. Good in school, always having the nose in a book, big glasses on a not so pretty face, skinny. <i>You are a nerd who is way too supernatural to be a typical nerd.</i> Yes, that too. I got some.. \u201cLet\u2019s start with the training. Team up with a partner and start with push-ups. Continue with sit-ups.\u201d, the coach\u2019s voice startled me. MJ turned to me and asked if I would team up with her. \u201cSure.\u201d </p><p>On my way to the mats someone bumped into me. \u201cSorry.\u201d, Peter Parker said. \u201cNo big deal.\u201d, I smiled and turned to MJ who had a curious look on her face. \u201cWhat is going on with your future husband?\u201d, my cheeks turned crimson red. \u201cStop!\u201d, I whisper-yelled. She grinned. \u201cJust start already.\u201d</p><p>I got onto the mat and started doing push-ups. Michelle started to look at me weird when I just continued. After 70 push-ups my arm muscles were burning. I got on my knees and took a deep breath. \u201cWhat was that? Nobody does 70 push-ups like it\u2019s nothing. Especially not you.\u201d I rolled my eyes. \u201cWhy thank you for the boost of confidence. It\u2019s your turn.\u201d Michelle groaned and started but she laid flat after 20.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dying.\u201d, she groaned for the second time. I giggled. \u201cGet up and let me do the sit-ups. She obliged and held my feet to the ground while I was getting started. I couldn\u2019t resist overhearing a conversation.</p><p>\"Go talk to her.\u201d, someone said. \u201cNo! She is way out of my league.\u201d, said Peter. So clearly it wasn\u2019t spoken about me. Sadly.</p><p>I continued with sit-ups until my stomach muscles were burning. I was exhausted. Soon the lesson was over and I followed MJ to the changing rooms. </p><p>In Physics I couldn\u2019t concentrate because 1. I was sitting behind Peter and 2. My powers started kicking in again. I just looked at the metal ball in front of me tapping my fingers against the table and soon the ball was a sheet. I gasped and grabbed it, hopefully fast enough. I couldn\u2019t wait for the afternoon with Wanda and training. </p><p>Oh yeah, I am a bender. I can control the elements plus blood, mind and metal. My powers surfaced when I was extremely pissed at Tony, for not asking me if I wanted to be adopted by him and Pepper. He did it anyways. Making me a Stark. (Y/N) Stark. </p><p>I didn\u2019t mind now. He was always kind of a father for me and he treated me as his own child. </p><p>The bell took me back to reality and I packed my stuff. I could see my veins in my arms turning crimson red. I rolled my sleeves down and speeded out of the room. I heard someone yell my name but I didn\u2019t listen. I ran to the bathrooms and looked into the mirror only to see my eyes turning white. I could still see but it was different. I had to get of here.</p><p>Before something worse happens.</p><p>I pulled my hood deep enough to cover the red fire like veins and the white eyes. I left the bathroom looking left and right to find nobody. I hurried to the exit only to be stopped in my tracks when I recognize Peter standing there waiting for me. \u201cOh no. Not now.\u201d, I groaned quietly. \u201cHey.\u201d, he said. I tried to not lift my head to his voice. I walked around him and out of the building.</p><p>I blinked a few times stumbling down the stairs to the street. \u201cHey, easy there. Are you okay?\u201d, he tried to grab my arm and help me but I yanked it away. \u201cDo not touch me.\u201d, I said with gritted teeth. He backed away at the sight of my angry expression. He was scared. I didn\u2019t want to scare him. Not Peter. I blinked and got away quickly to the black SUV which was already waiting for me. Happy got out as he saw the state I was in. He opened the door for me.</p><p>On the way the Avengers Base I tried to calm down. I jumped right out of the car when I saw a Jet landing on the platform. It was dangerous for the people to be around me. I didn\u2019t want to hurt them. I already hurt Tony and Pepper once. I ran away back then and that\u2019s what I was intending to do now too. </p><p>But Bucky and Wanda were already there. Bucky grabbed my arms and Wanda tapped my forehead to put me to sleep. </p><p>Drenched in sweat I woke up again. Wanda sat in the armchair next to my bed and Bucky spoke quietly with Tony. \u201cDid I hurt anyone?\u201d, I asked with a hoarse voice. I need water. They all turned to me. Tony rushed to my side and grabbed my hand. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d, he asked quietly. I smiled lightly and nodded. \u201cI just need some water.\u201d At that very moment Vision came through the wall with a big glass of water. \u201cThank you.\u201d, he smiled and stood behind Wanda. \u201cHow are you, honey?\u201d, another voice said. Pepper. She kissed my forehead. \u201cI\u2019m better than \u2013 wait, what day is it?\u201d, I wrinkled my brows. Bucky answered: \u201cYou were asleep for 5 days, (Y/N).\u201d I groaned. Not again. I could feel something going through my veins. I shivered but it didn\u2019t go away. I looked at my arms. The veins were red again. \u201cLeave.\u201d, I said. Pepper kissed my forehead one more time and Tony squeezed my hand and Bucky just nudged my leg. Wanda and Vision stayed and took my hands. I started to scream as the fire went through my body.

I smiled lightly and nodded. \u201cI just need some water.\u201d At that very moment Vision came through the wall with a big glass of water. \u201cThank you.\u201d, he smiled and stood behind Wanda. \u201cHow are you, honey?\u201d, another voice said. Pepper. She kissed my forehead. \u201cI\u2019m better than \u2013 wait, what day is it?\u201d, I wrinkled my brows. Bucky answered: \u201cYou were asleep for 5 days, (Y/N).\u201d I groaned. Not again. I could feel something going through my veins. I shivered but it didn\u2019t go away. I looked at my arms. The veins were red again. \u201cLeave.\u201d, I said. Pepper kissed my forehead one more time and Tony squeezed my hand and Bucky just nudged my leg. Wanda and Vision stayed and took my hands. I started to scream as the fire went through my body. I could feel it in my head, in my chest and even in my toes. Wanda and Vision tried their best to help me through this. At some point it all went black. </p><p>The next time I awoke it was from loud yelling. I opened my eyes and looked around in my room. I was alone. I sat up and got out of bed to follow the loud voices. They were downstairs.</p><p>\u201cNo! I am not going to do this!\u201d, that was Tony. \u201cShe is dangerous!\u201d, Steve Rogers. \u201cJust because you are not used to supernatural beings doesn\u2019t mean that they are not allowed to exist! You are intolerant! I thought your name was standing for Righteousness but I guess I was wrong!\u201d, Bucky. \u201cGuys, calm down! She can learn to control her powers! She is just at the beginning! Steve, give her a chance.\u201d, Natasha. I went downstairs but hid behind the corner. \u201cYou do know what happened last time she lost control. She-\u201d I was deadly calm when I started to walk inside the room. They stared at me with wide eyes. \u201cShe can speak for herself.\u201d, I said when I stood in front of Steve. Bruce came up to me and Steve. \u201cSteve, you gave me a chance. So why not her?\u201d Steve looked at his friend and nodded. \u201cFine.\u201d </p><p>From this moment I never wanted to be in the same room as Steve. </p><p>~~~~~~</p><p>A few weeks later was my graduation. Tony, Pepper, Wanda, Bruce, Natasha and Thor came. They all clapped when I got my diploma.</p><p>When I headed to my family Peter came up to me. \u201cHey.\u201d, he said cautiously. We hadn\u2019t talked since the incident in front of the school. \u201cHi.\u201d, I responded. \u201cUhm..I wanted to talk to you.\u201d I laughed a bit: \u201cMe too.\u201d He scratched the back of his neck. \u201cI don\u2019t know what was up with you a few weeks ago but I don\u2019t care anymore. But I would be willing to find out. I uhm\u2026like you and I want to get to know you. That sounds so weird. Uhm..\u201d I laughed a bit as we continued to walk towards Tony and the others. \u201cI actually wanted to apologize for what happened back then. I didn\u2019t have control\u2026I\u2019m sorry. And oh, I like you too.\u201d <i>You love him, you idiot. We don\u2019t even know each other, you assbutt.</i></p><p>Peter wanted to say something whenTony decided to interrupt him: \u201cOi, Spider-Boy. Don\u2019t touch my daughter!\u201d, he came with a grin at us and pointed his index finger at Peter. Spider-Boy? I rolled my eyes and thought about the term Tony used on Peter, as if they knew each other. Peter on the other hand was shocked. \u201cDaughter? You are Mr. Stark\u2019s daughter?\u201d, he went pale. \u201cYes, she is. And don\u2019t even think about starting something. If I catch you even looking at her I swear-\u201d \u201cDad!\u201d, I cut him off. Both looked at me. \u201cDad?\u201d, they said in unison. I put my hand over my mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s the first time you ever said \u2018Dad\u2019 to me.\u201d I could have sworn I saw a tear in his eye.</p><p>\u201cFirst: Yes, Peter, I am his daughter. Adoptive but well\u2026I am his daughter. Second: Dad, you are not going to stop me if I want to spend time with Peter. And Third: Spider-Boy?\u201d</p><p>Dad smiled and put a hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder who was in fact still pale and quiet and afraid.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N), you joined the Avengers a few weeks ago when you learned how to control your powers.\u201d, Dad started but I cut him off again. \u201cDad, what are-\u201d \u201cLet me speak, child.\u201d He grinned and looked at Peter. Peter looked at me with wide eyes. \u201c(Y/N), I want you to meet the newest member of the Avengers. Peter Parker aka Spider-Boy.\u201d \u201cSpider-Man. It\u2019s actually Spider-Man.\u201d, Peter whispered looking me in the eyes. I was shocked. \u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>Peter Parker/ Spider-Man - &ldquo;What the hell?!&rdquo; </h1><p>Your POV</p><p>That was awkward.</p><p>It were the last weeks of school. Everything should be good. But clumsy as I am I managed to run into Peter Parker. Nothing awkward with that, well not unnatural much, but we fell to the floor because he was running. We fell onto each other. That was weird even for someone like me. His face was inches away from mine and I could feel his breath against my cheek. Peter got up fast and cleared his throat. When he noticed I was still on the floor he quickly extended his hand and helped me up. I blushed as I felt a shiver going down my spine. Thanks to me for having a giant fricking crush on Peter Parker. &ldquo;Sorry, I didn&rsquo;t expect to crush on someone. I mean- to crash into someone. Oh my god, I&hellip;just&hellip;I&rsquo;ll just stop talking.&rdquo;, I mumbled. Peter smiled and shook my hand which he was surprisingly still holding. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Peter. Peter Parker.&rdquo;, he said. I nodded: &ldquo;I know.&rdquo; I took my hand from his. &ldquo;Okay, that sounded creepy.&rdquo; He shook his head. &ldquo;I have to go.&rdquo;, I said quickly. I turned around and to the school doors. &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;, I heard Peter yell after me. I turned to him again. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get your name.&rdquo;, he said walking towards me a bit. &ldquo;(Y/N).&rdquo;, I slightly smiled at thought that I talked to, actually talked to him, not just in my head. Or with my computer. Peter smiled genuinely at me and walked away. I walked out of the building and straight into a puddle. Lucky me. Happy would be there any minute.</p><p>The next day in PE I sat next to MJ who was reading a book. She took her books everywhere. <i>Stop complaining, you do that too. Yes, I have a book with me but I&rsquo;m not reading it right now.</i> I&rsquo;m the typical nerd. Good in school, always having the nose in a book, big glasses on a not so pretty face, skinny. <i>You are a nerd who is way too supernatural to be a typical nerd.</i> Yes, that too. I got some.. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s start with the training. Team up with a partner and start with push-ups. Continue with sit-ups.&rdquo;, the coach&rsquo;s voice startled me. MJ turned to me and asked if I would team up with her. &ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; </p><p>On my way to the mats someone bumped into me. &ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo;, Peter Parker said. &ldquo;No big deal.&rdquo;, I smiled and turned to MJ who had a curious look on her face. &ldquo;What is going on with your future husband?&rdquo;, my cheeks turned crimson red. &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;, I whisper-yelled. She grinned. &ldquo;Just start already.&rdquo;</p><p>I got onto the mat and started doing push-ups. Michelle started to look at me weird when I just continued. After 70 push-ups my arm muscles were burning. I got on my knees and took a deep breath. &ldquo;What was that? Nobody does 70 push-ups like it&rsquo;s nothing. Especially not you.&rdquo; I rolled my eyes. &ldquo;Why thank you for the boost of confidence. It&rsquo;s your turn.&rdquo; Michelle groaned and started but she laid flat after 20.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dying.&rdquo;, she groaned for the second time. I giggled. &ldquo;Get up and let me do the sit-ups. She obliged and held my feet to the ground while I was getting started. I couldn&rsquo;t resist overhearing a conversation.</p><p>\"Go talk to her.&rdquo;, someone said. &ldquo;No! She is way out of my league.&rdquo;, said Peter. So clearly it wasn&rsquo;t spoken about me. Sadly.</p><p>I continued with sit-ups until my stomach muscles were burning. I was exhausted. Soon the lesson was over and I followed MJ to the changing rooms. </p><p>In Physics I couldn&rsquo;t concentrate because 1. I was sitting behind Peter and 2. My powers started kicking in again. I just looked at the metal ball in front of me tapping my fingers against the table and soon the ball was a sheet. I gasped and grabbed it, hopefully fast enough. I couldn&rsquo;t wait for the afternoon with Wanda and training. </p><p>Oh yeah, I am a bender. I can control the elements plus blood, mind and metal. My powers surfaced when I was extremely pissed at Tony, for not asking me if I wanted to be adopted by him and Pepper. He did it anyways. Making me a Stark. (Y/N) Stark. </p><p>I didn&rsquo;t mind now. He was always kind of a father for me and he treated me as his own child. </p><p>The bell took me back to reality and I packed my stuff. I could see my veins in my arms turning crimson red. I rolled my sleeves down and speeded out of the room. I heard someone yell my name but I didn&rsquo;t listen. I ran to the bathrooms and looked into the mirror only to see my eyes turning white. I could still see but it was different. I had to get of here.</p><p>Before something worse happens.</p><p>I pulled my hood deep enough to cover the red fire like veins and the white eyes. I left the bathroom looking left and right to find nobody. I hurried to the exit only to be stopped in my tracks when I recognize Peter standing there waiting for me. &ldquo;Oh no. Not now.&rdquo;, I groaned quietly. &ldquo;Hey.&rdquo;, he said. I tried to not lift my head to his voice. I walked around him and out of the building.</p><p>I blinked a few times stumbling down the stairs to the street. &ldquo;Hey, easy there. Are you okay?&rdquo;, he tried to grab my arm and help me but I yanked it away. &ldquo;Do not touch me.&rdquo;, I said with gritted teeth. He backed away at the sight of my angry expression. He was scared. I didn&rsquo;t want to scare him. Not Peter. I blinked and got away quickly to the black SUV which was already waiting for me. Happy got out as he saw the state I was in. He opened the door for me.</p><p>On the way the Avengers Base I tried to calm down. I jumped right out of the car when I saw a Jet landing on the platform. It was dangerous for the people to be around me. I didn&rsquo;t want to hurt them. I already hurt Tony and Pepper once. I ran away back then and that&rsquo;s what I was intending to do now too. </p><p>But Bucky and Wanda were already there. Bucky grabbed my arms and Wanda tapped my forehead to put me to sleep. </p><p>Drenched in sweat I woke up again. Wanda sat in the armchair next to my bed and Bucky spoke quietly with Tony. &ldquo;Did I hurt anyone?&rdquo;, I asked with a hoarse voice. I need water. They all turned to me. Tony rushed to my side and grabbed my hand. &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;, he asked quietly. I smiled lightly and nodded. &ldquo;I just need some water.&rdquo; At that very moment Vision came through the wall with a big glass of water. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;, he smiled and stood behind Wanda. &ldquo;How are you, honey?&rdquo;, another voice said. Pepper. She kissed my forehead. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m better than &ndash; wait, what day is it?&rdquo;, I wrinkled my brows. Bucky answered: &ldquo;You were asleep for 5 days, (Y/N).&rdquo; I groaned. Not again. I could feel something going through my veins. I shivered but it didn&rsquo;t go away. I looked at my arms. The veins were red again. &ldquo;Leave.&rdquo;, I said. Pepper kissed my forehead one more time and Tony squeezed my hand and Bucky just nudged my leg. Wanda and Vision stayed and took my hands. I started to scream as the fire went through my body.
