You can\u2019t help but smile every time\u00a0 he follows your movements and then looks at the ground &ldquo;good job, that&rsquo;s all for today&rdquo; <br/>Everyone runs to the showers while you tie your laces slowly to buy some time. <br/>&ldquo;soldier&rdquo; he says pproaching you.<br/>&ldquo;Captain&rdquo; you say biting your lip.<br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve looked at your schedule and you&rsquo;re free this afternoon, do you feel like going to the town for a drink?&rdquo; Steve says looking at your lips.<br/>&ldquo;sounds perfect&rdquo; you smile.<br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait for you at the bar&rdquo; he winks at you before going to the showers.</p><p>You had a date with Steve Rogers&hellip; You were still smiling when you entered your room. What excuse were you going to give Lily?<br/>&ldquo;Hey Lily I know we had plans for today but&hellip;&rdquo; you start to say.<br/>&ldquo;i know but I think I have a fever&rdquo; she says interrupting you.<br/>&ldquo;ohh then I&rsquo;d better leave you alone to rest&rdquo; you say quickly trying to hide your smile.<br/>&ldquo;yeah&hellip; i dont want you to get sick because of me but, where will you be this afternoon?&rdquo; she asks.<br/>&ldquo;training, you know&rdquo; you answer quickly.<br/>&ldquo;good&hellip;&rdquo; she says.<br/>&ldquo;good&hellip;I&rsquo;m going to take some clothes and I&rsquo;ll change somewhere else so I don&rsquo;t bother you, I&rsquo;ll see you tonight&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;perfect&rdquo; Lily coughs &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to sleep now&rdquo; </p><p>Leave the camp has been easier than you thought, the town wasn\u2019t far away so in a few minutes you were at the bar&rsquo;s door. Suddenly you were nervous but there is no turning back, so you push the bar door and enter. You don\u2019t see Steve at the bar so you sit at one of the tables while you wait for him. <br/>&ldquo;excuse me, is this seat taken?&rdquo; Steve says with a big smile.<br/>&ldquo;apparently my date is late so&hellip; all yours&rdquo; you joke.<br/>&ldquo;Lucky me&rdquo; he sits in front of you.<br/>&ldquo;Are you sure that nobody that we know comes here?&rdquo; you asks.<br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been coming here for weeks and I haven&rsquo;t met anyone from the camp&rdquo; He says before ordering a few drinks.<br/>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say that you couldn\u2019t get drunk?&rdquo; you asks.<br/>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t like the taste&rdquo; he says before drinking.<br/>&ldquo;true&hellip;so about last night&hellip;&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;you regret it?&rdquo; he asks.<br/>&ldquo;no&hellip; of course not&hellip;&rdquo; you grab his hand &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that it&rsquo;s not easy to act as if I hadn&rsquo;t kissed you when we are in front of others&rdquo; you explain.<br/>&ldquo;i know but if they find out about us, they will expel you. You are a great soldier, I can&rsquo;t let that happen to you&rdquo; he says before giving you a short kiss &ldquo;let&rsquo;s dance&rdquo; He says offering his hand.<br/>&ldquo;what? here?&rdquo; You look around, there were some couples dancing &ldquo;everyone is going to look at us&rdquo; <br/>&ldquo;nobody knows us, come on&rdquo; He insists and how are you going to refuse to dance with him? So you accept. He puts his hands on your waist just like he did the night before &ldquo;you are blushing&rdquo; he says with a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not used to dancing like this and least of all in front of people&rdquo; You put your head on his shoulder.<br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a lucky man, you have already danced with me twice&rdquo; he caresses your back. Dancing wasn\u2019t your thing but if you could be so close with\u00a0 Steve, you would dance all night.. After dancing for a while you sit at your table to rest when someone comes through the door.<br/>&ldquo;oh my good, don&rsquo;t look&rdquo; You say trying to cover your face. Steve was confused but then he hears a voice.<br/>&ldquo;Steve Rogers with a date&rdquo; Sam says.<br/>&ldquo;shh&hellip; what are you doing here?!&rdquo; Steve says looking around in case there was someone else with him.<br/>&ldquo;I just wanted to have a few drinks and who is this beautiful girl?&rdquo; he asks.<br/>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; You didn&rsquo;t know very well what to say when you see another familiar face enter through the door &ldquo;Lily?&rdquo; <br/>&ldquo;Y/N? what are you doing here..?&rdquo; he stops when he sees Rogers &ldquo;oh my good&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;I see that you no longer have a fever&rdquo; you say with smile.<br/>&ldquo;yeah&hellip; i feel beter now&rdquo; Lily lies.<br/>&ldquo;wait&hellip; you and Sam?&rdquo; She nods with a big smile on her face. <br/>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind if we sit with you guys do you?&rdquo; Sam says making you sit next to Steve while they sit in front of you.<br/>&ldquo;when did that happend?&rdquo; you ask.<br/>&ldquo;last night when we were in the mission, and what about you guys?&rdquo; Lily explains.<br/>&ldquo;same i guess&rdquo; you admite.<br/>&ldquo;Well, we were leaving so&hellip;&rdquo; Steve says this time.<br/>&ldquo;were we?&rdquo; you asks.<br/>&ldquo;yeah, well i guess i don&rsquo;t need to say this is a secret right?&rdquo; he says and Sam and Lily nods. &ldquo;Good&rdquo; Steve takes your hand leaving the bar.</p><p><br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"268\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c2dc45d060c2c009b2a0637a08595323/tumblr_inline_pmzhpqQBzm1s3c2y7_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"268\"/></figure><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Did you have any idea about them?&rdquo; you ask Steve.<br/>&ldquo;no, he told me that he likes her but i had no idea&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;she told me that she had a fever and that we couldn&rsquo;t hang out this afternoon&rdquo; You both smile at the situation &ldquo;Now that they have taken our place in the bar, where are we going?&rdquo; you say while Steve lay his arm over your shoulders.<br/>&ldquo;lets take a walk, I will drive you to the base later&rdquo; he offers.</p><p>Five minutes later you were in his car kissing him<br/>&ldquo;I thought we were going for a walk&rdquo; he says while he kisses you.<br/>&ldquo;we walked to you car&rdquo; you say and he smiles.<br/>&ldquo;i hate to say this but we should go back&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;no&hellip; can we just stay here forever?
