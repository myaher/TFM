        "body": "<p><b><i>Summary: Harry and Y/N haven\u2019t seen each other in a while</i></b></p><p><b><i>Warnings: angst</i></b></p><p><b><i>Word Count: 4.1k</i></b></p><p><i>In a perfect world, Y/N would\u2019ve had the courage to confess\u2013 again\u2013 but maybe when the circumstances were a bit better than they were before. Maybe he would actually reciprocate her feelings, and maybe he wouldn\u2019t have met Luna because he had decided that his heart belonged to Y/N back home. </i></p><!-- more --><p>In an effort to add more people into her minuscule group of friends, Y/N had signed up for Zumba at her local community center. She was a bit iffy at first about signing up because it wasn\u2019t cheap, and Y/N would rather much buy herself some snacks at the store, but she knew that she needed to get out there in order to get her mind off of her failed confession to Harry. Ever since she first stepped into the activity room with a large mirror right in front of her, Y/N was forced to face with her reflection and watch her body move quite stiffly with the music.<br/></p><p>Then, she would\u2019ve disregarded the obvious flaws because Y/N wasn\u2019t very harsh with herself and she thought that whatever is \u2018<i>wrong</i>\u2019 with her, she can improve; that\u2019s why she chose to see only the good things, thing that she liked. She was on the heavier side, a sizeable bum than most and she had a muffin top, but Y/N used those societal flaws to build herself up to be more confident. Plus, Harry always told her that she looked beautiful, and complimented her whenever he could. It wasn\u2019t that she <i>needed</i> Harry\u2019s approval to know that she\u2019s beautiful, but it definitely helped her self-esteem when someone like him made herself believe that she was worth something. So that\u2019s why she was a bit confused as to why Y/N was looking at herself right now and was only seeing the flaws she otherwise would\u2019ve ignored or maybe gaped at in a positive light. Her hips were jutting out a bit more, she noticed. A sixth sense made her feel like everybody around her was staring at her in judgment. A sane part of her knows that she was just being paranoid, but the larger half couldn\u2019t help but be more aware of her actions, taking unnecessary steps back so she wouldn\u2019t be in anyone\u2019s direct line of view.</p><p>And Y/N knew why she was perceiving this sort of emotion. She recognized that a considerable part of her was envious of Luna\u2019s appearance. Y/N wasn\u2019t anywhere near hers&ndash;beauty wise&ndash;so maybe that\u2019s the root of all of her negative input. She was used to it, she guesses. Being around Harry for an extensive amount of time meant that she was in a plethora of pictures, ones that were posted in media articles, newspapers, and on social media. While others ignored her visible presence of being in the background right behind him, other outlets still isolated her and made comments about who she was without really learning who she is. So yes, there are some assumptions being made and certainly are their gossips about her looks saying that she was \u2018t<i>oo ugly</i>\u2019 to be hanging out with Harry, or that she wasn\u2019t as skinny as the previous women he had linked himself to (assuming that they were dating). Like she said, it usually wouldn\u2019t disturb her or trouble her mind since Harry\u2019s reassurance echoes in her mind every time she doubted herself. It was comforting for someone to just <i>be</i> there for her, but Y/N was in slow progress of accepting the fact that he might not be there for her anymore in the v<i>ery</i> near future, she figures. </p><p>&mdash;- </p><p><i>\u201cHey Y/N, are you okay? You seemed about out of it</i>,\u201d Darren, the instructor, approached her when most of the participants left the room. She was searching for the towel she was quite sure she threw in her gym bag in a rush. </p><p>\u201c<b><i>Huh? Yeah, I\u2019m okay. Thanks\u201d</i></b> Y/N smiled at him, forcing herself to converse with him although she wasn\u2019t in the best mood right now. </p><p><i>\u201cSo I was thinking, if you aren\u2019t doing anything Friday night &hellip;we could maybe get dinner together,\u201d </i>Darren started, inspecting her face for any sign of discomfort from her. The last thing he wanted was for Y/N to feel uncomfortable because of him.</p><p>\u201c<b><i>Oh no, I\u2019m sorry I have plan&ndash;</i></b>,\u201d Y/N trailed off, a sudden realization hitting her square in the face. Friday night used to be t<i>heir nights.</i> She closed off and rejected any invitations given to her especially on Friday\u2019s because there was no question as to whether or not she and Harry were going to hang out or not&ndash; it was always a yes. They didn\u2019t even check in on each other if they\u2019re cool for spending time together because it was such a routine that nobody dared questioned. </p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s okay if you can\u2019t, by the way</i>,\u201d He added, noticing that she was taking a pregnant pause. He shifted on his sneaker-clad feet nervously while biting his lip. </p><p><i>If he already missed three weeks in a row, what are the chances of him missing a straight fourth?</i></p><p>Y/N chuckled anxiously, not knowing whether to say yes or now. On one hand, it was a good step for her to spend Friday nights with somebody else instead of her more recent contexts where she sat on her couch alone, eating frozen meals and staring emotionlessly at a supposed \u2018<i>comedy show</i>\u2019. But on the other, there was still a slice of her endlessly hoping that Harry would somehow change his plans to include her&ndash;his best friend&ndash; if she could even label herself that. It was saddening, really; she was waiting for him to (hopefully) realize that he missed her but then again, she wasn\u2019t in the place to assume anything since Y/N didn\u2019t know what he was thinking or even <i>how</i> he was feeling recently. </p><p>\u201c<b><i>You know what?\u201d</i></b> Y/N said, clearing her throat. Darren raised an eyebrow at her.<i><b> \u201cI think it would be gr&ndash;\u201d </b></i></p><p>Both of them glanced at her left hand where she clutched her phone. She gives him a sheepish smile. He must be so annoyed at her. </p><p>\u201c<i>Hey y/n, wanna hang out this friday? :))</i></p><p><i>Luna\u2019s going out with her friends</i></p><p><i>It\u2019s ok if u dont wanna :/\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<b><i>Um actually, I can\u2019t. Maybe next time,</i></b>\u201d Y/N finally responded, bashfully might she add. She could feel her plump cheeks heating up as if a space heater hit her at full blast, making her cheeks pink. </p><p>\u201c<i>It\u2019s alright. Maybe next time, </i>\u201c Darren repeated. She could see the twinkle in his eyes dispersing a bit and his body to be slouching just an inch shorter. However, she couldn\u2019t find it in herself to care about him; not when Harry had planted himself back in her otherwise boring life. </p><p>Yes, it was a bit pitying for Y/N to just let Harry in again despite his actions, but she couldn\u2019t help it. She really does miss him and she\u2019s sure that Harry will explain himself.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>It was finally Friday and Y/N was bouncing on her toes, excited about tonight\u2019s event. She still had a couple of hours before she would be heading over to his house with a bag of goodies. The fact that she hasn\u2019t seen him in a while added spine-tingling energy bursting through her whole body. She woke up on the right side of the bed, the sun peeked through her blinds in the right amounts so she wasn\u2019t blinded. The weather was perfect because when Y/N missed slipping her feet in her fuzzy slippers, her sole was met with a warmness that would usually be a frigid platform. So yes, her mood was elevated profoundly and it was all because of Harry.</p><p>She made her breakfast while she was swaying her hips to the beat of the song from her playlist. Y/N thought about how he was able to take her sucky week and do a complete 180. That was when she had to accept another fate; that she was&ndash;no doubt&ndash; absolutely in love with him that she was willing to brush his misdemeanors off of her shoulder just like that. She couldn\u2019t find one bone in her body to hate him and she didn\u2019t even reprimand herself for feeling that way because the love she\u2019d grown for him overpowered any other emotion. She was sure that she\u2019d resemble a heart-eyed emoji right now. </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Y/N was giddy, she could feel it throughout her entire body. Her skin was buzzing against her pajamas that she\u2019d worn underneath a layer of clothes to keep her warm. Her fingers pressed the doorbell by the side of the frame. A smile was basically plastered on her face and her cheeks were getting sore for sure yet Y/N\u2019s expression stayed the same despite the cold nipping at her exposed skin. She waited for the porch lights to turn on, indicating that he had let his eye peep through the hole on the door to see her face. For what seemed like five minutes, she stood there in her boots, having already rung the bell twice and her happy expression steadily sagged into one of worry, anxiousness, and disappointment. <i>Did he forget or did he just not hear her?</i> She hoped for the latter because after all, being forgotten was solid evidence of her not being a priority in his life anymore. </p><p>The sun had already started setting when she stepped foot outside her apartment and locked the doors so it was no surprise that the night sky had immersed itself in a blanket full of stars, dimly reflecting off of shiny windshields of the cars parked in the driveway. The street lights were her only source of metaphorical warmth. His car was here, so <i>why wasn\u2019t he answering the door?</i></p><p>It had been ten minutes later when Y/N heard the clicks of the locks from the other side of the door from her position, butt frozen sitting on the wooden staircase leading up to his front door. She had tightened the hood of her sweater over her head and her hands were shoved in the pockets to conserve heat after she spent time contacting him on her phone to which she got no reply. </p><p><i>\u201cY/N,\u201d</i> He breathed out. She stood up quickly, almost slipping at the abruptness and for a moment she saw stars circling in front of her eyes but she steadied herself. </p><p><b><i>\u201cWhat took you so long?</i></b>\u201d She muttered while bending down to get the bag of food. Standing up straighter, he could see that he was matching her; grey sweatpants and a t-shirt.</p><p><i>\u201cJ-just doing some stuff around the house,</i>\u201d He leaned in for a hug after she had kicked off her shoes messily to the side. Her coat hung on the rack and the heat of Harry\u2019s home made her stomach feel fuzzy. Y/N succumbed immediately into his warm hug, nuzzling her face into his neck like she always does. <i>\u201cMissed you, lovie\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<b><i>Missed you too, H\u201d</i></b> It was a deja-vu moment for her, mind flashing back to the airport a couple of weeks ago. But he was here now, he wasn\u2019t going to leave her to run off with Luna; he was hers for the time being and she damn as hell going to make sure that every second with him was spent well. </p><p>She felt the familiar knack in his arms as he tightened the length of it around her body, his hair tickling her face in the slightest ways, bodies pressed together so near that it felt like they were one. Y/N breathed in deeply, searching for his scent that filled her nostrils and made her heart beat calmly. When she did, it was different. It was sweet in a sense, a robust aroma wafting off of his neck, something raw and metallic; unfamiliar.</p><p>Her sock-covered feet padded against the marble flooring, bag rusting as she swayed it while she walked. Her voice resonated in the large room in question about how he was doing and what he had been up to that he took such a long time to get the door. She got her answer not a second later, not from the deep rumbling of his chest, but the sight in front of her. </p><p>Y/N\u2019s head tilted to the side in confusion of seeing the back of Luna\u2019s head as she scavenged the refrigerator for food. She turned around to face Harry, eyebrows raising as if to say <i>\u2018what is she doing here?</i>\u2019. He was about to open his mouth when Luna closed the fridge door. </p><p><i>\u201cHarry, you have no more bread</i>,\u201d Luna whined out, not facing their direction yet. </p><p>\u201c<i>Sorry, babe. We\u2019ll buy more tomorrow,\u201d</i> \u00a0She turned around then, eyes going wide in the surprise of seeing Y/N. </p><p>\u201c<i>Oh, hi Y/N!</i>\u201d Luna greeted her, long legs taking strides to pull Y/N in for an embrace. She was stuck frozen, trying to decipher what was currently happening. </p><p>\u201c<i>Luna\u2019s friends canceled so she\u2019s staying with us tonight,</i>\u201d Y/N could feel a drought simpering in her throat. </p><p>\u201c<i>I hope that\u2019s okay</i>,\u201d Luna continued, concern flooding her beautiful features as she stared at Y/N. </p><p>Harry wasn\u2019t doing <i>something</i>, he was doing <i>someone</i>. Luna. That would certainly explain why she was wearing an oversized jumper stopping mid-thigh, probably underwear, and some socks; it was Harry\u2019s jumper, Y/N concludes because she wore the same one when she complained about being cold one night in his house. It would explain her messy hair, tinted cheeks, and the dazed look in her eyes. They fucked before she got here, that\u2019s why he couldn\u2019t answer the door. Y/N felt disgusting, turning her body fully to face him, inspecting him. His t-shirt was wrinkled, allowing her to see (at close distance) a bruise forming on his neck and clavicle, his hair was <i>sex</i> hair and that god-awful smell she was whiffing was the smell of <i>sex</i>. A shiver ran down her spine at the thought of their actions and the fact that he held her close minutes after he finished with <i>her</i>. As if he needed a hug like the one they shared; full of love and emotion of missing each others\u2019 presence because Y/N certainly did, but him, it was an ordinary action probably acted on through kindness because he didn\u2019t need her anymore. He didn\u2019t need love sprouting from Y/N because he can get it from someone else. A separate devastation harnessed its way into her heart at the visual of a man that she was so helplessly besotted with sharing an intimate action with someone he had known for only months.</p><p>\u201c<b><i>Y-yes of course,</i></b>\u201d Y/N swallowed thickly, still trying to wrap her mind around the context. Her eyes found Harry\u2019s which were filled with worry, begging her to let him explain <i>what the hell just happened.</i></p><p><i>\u201cGreat! Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll take care of the food, you guys make yourselves comfortable,\u201d</i> Luna beamed, shooing the both of them away from the kitchen and towards the living room but not before grabbing Harry\u2019s shirt and giving him a kiss on the lips. </p><p>&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>As soon as Y/N thought that they would be out of earshot, she instantaneously turned around to face Harry who was following her closely. </p><p><b><i>\u201cWhat the hell, Harry? You said she was going out, that it would just be the both of us,\u201d</i></b> Y/N sneered, hands waving in frustration. </p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Y/N. Her plans fell through and she was already here anyways so I thought that you wouldn\u2019t mind if she joined us, \u201c</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cI just thought it\u2019d be the two of us,\u201d</i></b></p><p>\u201c<i>What\u2019s wrong with having her here?</i>\u201d He challenged her, eyebrows rising from their usual place. Y/N gulped heavily, choosing to be careful with her words. </p><p><b><i>\u201cNothing is wrong with her being here,\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cI wanted it to be like old times, you know?\u201d </i></b></p><p>Harry sighed deeply. His legs leading him to stand in front of her, tilting her chin up so she could see the sincerity behind them. </p><p>\u201c<i>Look Y/N, it\u2019s going to be different now,\u201d</i> His tone sounded like he was speaking to a child. \u201c<i>Luna and I are together and there\u2019s going to be some changes between&ndash; between us,\u201d</i></p><p><b>\u201c</b><i><b>I </b>know<b>, Harry. I\u2019m not expecting you to invite me every time. I haven\u2019t seen you in so long and she just comes here and take&ndash; spends her time with you and I barely get to see you, H\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cIf this is because of what I said to</i> y<i>ou before,</i> \u201c And she knew that he was talking about her confession. <i>\u201cFeelings change and sometimes you can\u2019t control it. I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you, Y/N. I wasn\u2019t ready to commit again,\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<b><i>That\u2019s beside the point!\u201d</i></b> Her voice reached a new volume and Harry shot her a warning glance to keep her voice down. <b><i>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if I told you about my feelings or not. What matters is you keep ditching me for her, canceling our plans because she wanted you to stay by her side.\u201d</i></b></p><p><i><b>\u201cI get that you guys are a couple but I feel like I\u2019m not even important to you anymore,\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s not true, you know that\u2019s not true,</i>\u201d He protested. Y/N didn\u2019t know if he was playing dumb or if he was really that daft. </p><p><b><i>\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time we hung out together, just us?\u201d</i></b></p><p>He gaped at her, pink lips opening and closing but no sound came from his throat. </p><p><b><i>\u201cExactly, you don\u2019t even know,\u201d</i></b></p><p>\u201c<i>She\u2019s my girlfriend, Y/N. You\u2019re just my .. my friend</i>\u201d He whispered agitatedly. </p><p>Her heart cracked and the fire igniting in her was extinguished. The embers floating amidst the dry and tense atmosphere. He had hit a soft spot, he knew that but it wasn\u2019t on purpose.</p><p><i><b>\u201cR-right. Of course,</b> </i>\u201c She nodded, accepting the cold, hard facts. She couldn\u2019t do anything and besides, he was speaking the truth. He never saw her as anything more than a friend and the sooner she gets over that, the faster she can mend her broken heart and move on. </p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to,\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N held up a palm indicating him to stop talking, <b><i>\u201cNo you\u2019re right. I\u2019m just a friend, a friend that waited out in the cold tonight only to be reminded that she\u2019s never going to be anything else to you, </i></b></p><p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t put words in my mouth and I told you I was doing something</i>,\u201d It was his turn to roll his eyes. </p><p>She scoffed, <b><i>\u201cYou weren\u2019t doing something, you were doing her!\u201d</i></b></p><p>\u201c<i>We\u2019re in a relationship. It\u2019s normal</i>,\u201d He explained. </p><p><i><b>\u201cI know it is,</b></i>\u201d Y/N took his comment as a blow for her lack of companionship. <i><b>\u201cI\u2019m just saying, you left me outside in the cold to f</b>uck<b> her&ndash;\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cSorry about that again,\u201d</i></p><p>She glared at him for interrupting her, \u201c<i><b>And you touched me as if you didn\u2019t just touch her minutes before! I mean </b>god<b> did you even wash your hands?\u201d</b></i></p><p>He only shook his head at her question. </p><p><b><i>\u201cThat\u2019s disgusting, Harry!\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cI said I was sorry! Why can\u2019t you accept that already?\u201d</i></p><p>She spotted the soiled couch, the cushions pressed in from the weight of Harry and Luna\u2019s bodies, the blanket was half on the couch and a half on the floor. </p><p><b><i>\u201cNot only did you take your sweet time getting to the door, but you also forgot about me these past few weeks and you know it,\u201d </i></b></p><p><i>\u201cI canceled one thing and you\u2019re acting as if I ruined this friendship,\u201d</i></p><p>She stared at him incredulously, \u201c<b><i>One? It was three, Harry! You kept saying \u2018maybe next time\u2019 but it never comes,\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cI can\u2019t just drop everything for you,\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>\u201cBut you used to\u201d </b></i></p><p>He ran a hand over his face, the stress of the conversation weighing in on him. </p><p><i>\u201cLuna, sh-she\u2019s more important now,\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m saying that I want to focus on her and me,\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cSo you\u2019re basically kicking me to the side? Because you found someone else to give you something that you can\u2019t accept from me?\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m doing, Y/N,\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<b><i>Then explain to me! Please, I\u2019m trying to understand you,\u201d</i></b> She begged him and Y/N\u2019s sure that Luna had probably heard their conversation by now. It didn\u2019t take that long to prepare the snacks.</p><p><i>\u201cI really want her and I to work,\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<b><i>I wish you the best too, you know that. I\u2019m just confused as to where I stand,</i></b>\u201d Y/N stated. \u201c<i><b>I don\u2019t want to make you choose, Har, but I need to know if you see me as a convenient person that will always catch you when you fall or if you really care about me because right now, it seems like you don't\u2019\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cI care about you and I love you, Y/N\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question, Styles,</b></i>\u201d Her eyes were stinging from the tears she was holding back. She wasn\u2019t going to give him the satisfaction of crying in front of him. \u201c<i><b>Are you keeping me around because you know I\u2019ll stay?\u201d</b></i></p><p>\u201c<b><i>Please don\u2019t take advantage of me like that.\u201d</i></b> She pleaded, a lone tear slipping down her cheek and he instinctively reached out to wipe it away; like he used to.</p><p><i>\u201cI-i\u2019m not,\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>\u201cProve it,\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cBut Y/N, you said you wouldn\u2019t make me chose</i>,\u201d His reply was an answer in itself, his actions and words were already hinting at possible disclosure between him and her, but hearing it from him made it more real. He already knew that he was going to choose Luna, but he kept Y/N around for the sake of his selfish reasons. </p><p><b><i>\u201cYou choose her, huh?\u201d</i></b></p><p>He tried to come closer to her, but every time he took a step forward, her body backed away from him. </p><p><i>\u201cI-i don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<b><i>I don\u2019t know either, H\u201d</i></b> She puffed her chest out, heart aching deeply at his words. </p><p><i>\u201cI really like her, Y/N\u201d</i></p><p>The knife in her chest twisted, breaking the pieces into sharper shards that scratch her insides, capturing her in an endless loop of pain. Everything she hoped to be, everything she desired to herself was given to somebody else and it<i>\u00a0wasn\u2019t fair</i>. It wasn\u2019t fair that she is treated so poorly right now by a man she loves and it wasn\u2019t even his fault! He\u2019s right, you can\u2019t control your feelings because Y/N still loves him the way she did before.</p><p><i><b>\u201cI know,\u201d</b></i></p><p>&mdash;</p><p>It hurts. There was a hole in her chest, an abyss swallowing every emotion she felt except anger, pain, grief, loneliness, and disappointment. Those stuck around, circling her heart and making her feel bad about herself but she couldn\u2019t find anything to counteract the sorrow she was feeling. It mocked her like Harry had used her. She didn\u2019t realize it at first because it was subtle and fundamental that when she did, \u00a0it was too late to try and revive the old Y/N. She died right along when Harry chose someone else over her. </p><p>Her body ached, limbs and joints remaining in the same position for a continuous amount of time. Y/N\u2019s throat was dry, having not spoken for days&ndash;having not left her place for days&ndash; and she felt like every time a word scraped by that she would break into a heaving sob, burning her lungs for air as snot filled her nostrils. She turned off her phone to disconnect herself from the outside world, surely nothing important would happen to a nobody like her; a thought that Harry further revealed as true by stepping on her and beating down on her love and trust. She refused to see herself in any reflection because she knew that she would only be met with a lifeless counterpart, a stranger staring at her because even she didn&rsquo;t know <i>who she was anymore.</i> It hurts when every time she closed her eyes, an image of Harry and Luna embedded itself permanently in her brain that she often had to spend nights staring at the ceiling, afraid to sleep. </p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t know if he was okay, he probably was, since she hasn\u2019t heard from anyone in days. Sometimes he would sneak into her dreams and give her a few moments to imagine a life where they were together; her dreams were a place for them to be together whereas reality only spits at her pathetic attempt of finding love. He used her for his own selfish reasons and she let him because she desired him too much. He only kept her around because she was a safety net in case anything goes wrong and she couldn\u2019t even let herself be too angry at him because <i>at least</i> he made her feel wanted. At least he trusted her with <i>him</i> himself; but he could never trust her with his heart even though she gave her own to Harry, willingly. </p><hr><p>&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>let me know what you thought!</p><p>taglist; <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrOnqAm3S2YJtqPJmZcO4hA\">@besitostyles</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQsX6KLms40JeRDlVk6NEWQ\">@fangirl-moment-x</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmxi3QUpqS4qTJLeJ8fcoTg\">@harrysahottie</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPsz_HJ-fGqnDHAg-f46rlw\">@rosepetalumbrella</a> @evalynanne <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1fpivr--tbthEpoz43VhvA\">@ynm1505</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mh1UB6m8cO8XVhlwnfb9nIw\">@cuddlebughazza</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRQvNGuL791trMASjjacTyQ\">@pxrrishly</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgQ5EdNPkpDmT4rcK7Heukg\">@lovableah</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5YrYTiKDl0TdQIXZojMV_A\">@always-alone19</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwsID5ppi1FgvnAzeQekAZw\">@projkiwidicine</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNYxAvIQgRI_STqjv_SuZBQ\">@harrystxleslx</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0cXlYozjbqnAyl8Z2SwQEg\">@harryspirate</a> @mutuallynotmutual <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3S2pR3NTVs5Hor-c5rdmsA\">@ftinxmirx</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtsSGFroaE9zkOMCKMZWCww\">@xalittlebitofeverythingx</a></p>",

Maybe he would actually reciprocate her feelings, and maybe he wouldn\u2019t have met Luna because he had decided that his heart belonged to Y/N back home. </i></p>[[MORE]]<p>In an effort to add more people into her minuscule group of friends, Y/N had signed up for Zumba at her local community center. She was a bit iffy at first about signing up because it wasn\u2019t cheap, and Y/N would rather much buy herself some snacks at the store, but she knew that she needed to get out there in order to get her mind off of her failed confession to Harry. Ever since she first stepped into the activity room with a large mirror right in front of her, Y/N was forced to face with her reflection and watch her body move quite stiffly with the music.<br></p><p>Then, she would\u2019ve disregarded the obvious flaws because Y/N wasn\u2019t very harsh with herself and she thought that whatever is \u2018<i>wrong</i>\u2019 with her, she can improve; that\u2019s why she chose to see only the good things, thing that she liked. She was on the heavier side, a sizeable bum than most and she had a muffin top, but Y/N used those societal flaws to build herself up to be more confident. Plus, Harry always told her that she looked beautiful, and complimented her whenever he could. It wasn\u2019t that she <i>needed</i> Harry\u2019s approval to know that she\u2019s beautiful, but it definitely helped her self-esteem when someone like him made herself believe that she was worth something. So that\u2019s why she was a bit confused as to why Y/N was looking at herself right now and was only seeing the flaws she otherwise would\u2019ve ignored or maybe gaped at in a positive light. Her hips were jutting out a bit more, she noticed. A sixth sense made her feel like everybody around her was staring at her in judgment. A sane part of her knows that she was just being paranoid, but the larger half couldn\u2019t help but be more aware of her actions, taking unnecessary steps back so she wouldn\u2019t be in anyone\u2019s direct line of view.</p><p>And Y/N knew why she was perceiving this sort of emotion. She recognized that a considerable part of her was envious of Luna\u2019s appearance. Y/N wasn\u2019t anywhere near hers\u2013beauty wise\u2013so maybe that\u2019s the root of all of her negative input. She was used to it, she guesses. Being around Harry for an extensive amount of time meant that she was in a plethora of pictures, ones that were posted in media articles, newspapers, and on social media. While others ignored her visible presence of being in the background right behind him, other outlets still isolated her and made comments about who she was without really learning who she is. So yes, there are some assumptions being made and certainly are their gossips about her looks saying that she was \u2018t<i>oo ugly</i>\u2019 to be hanging out with Harry, or that she wasn\u2019t as skinny as the previous women he had linked himself to (assuming that they were dating). Like she said, it usually wouldn\u2019t disturb her or trouble her mind since Harry\u2019s reassurance echoes in her mind every time she doubted herself. It was comforting for someone to just <i>be</i> there for her, but Y/N was in slow progress of accepting the fact that he might not be there for her anymore in the v<i>ery</i> near future, she figures. </p><p>\u2014- </p><p><i>\u201cHey Y/N, are you okay? You seemed about out of it</i>,\u201d Darren, the instructor, approached her when most of the participants left the room. She was searching for the towel she was quite sure she threw in her gym bag in a rush. </p><p>\u201c<b><i>Huh? Yeah, I\u2019m okay. Thanks\u201d</i></b> Y/N smiled at him, forcing herself to converse with him although she wasn\u2019t in the best mood right now. </p><p><i>\u201cSo I was thinking, if you aren\u2019t doing anything Friday night \u2026we could maybe get dinner together,\u201d </i>Darren started, inspecting her face for any sign of discomfort from her. The last thing he wanted was for Y/N to feel uncomfortable because of him.</p><p>\u201c<b><i>Oh no, I\u2019m sorry I have plan\u2013</i></b>,\u201d Y/N trailed off, a sudden realization hitting her square in the face. Friday night used to be t<i>heir nights.</i> She closed off and rejected any invitations given to her especially on Friday\u2019s because there was no question as to whether or not she and Harry were going to hang out or not\u2013 it was always a yes. They didn\u2019t even check in on each other if they\u2019re cool for spending time together because it was such a routine that nobody dared questioned. </p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s okay if you can\u2019t, by the way</i>,\u201d He added, noticing that she was taking a pregnant pause. He shifted on his sneaker-clad feet nervously while biting his lip. </p><p><i>If he already missed three weeks in a row, what are the chances of him missing a straight fourth?</i></p><p>Y/N chuckled anxiously, not knowing whether to say yes or now. On one hand, it was a good step for her to spend Friday nights with somebody else instead of her more recent contexts where she sat on her couch alone, eating frozen meals and staring emotionlessly at a supposed \u2018<i>comedy show</i>\u2019. But on the other, there was still a slice of her endlessly hoping that Harry would somehow change his plans to include her\u2013his best friend\u2013 if she could even label herself that. It was saddening, really; she was waiting for him to (hopefully) realize that he missed her but then again, she wasn\u2019t in the place to assume anything since Y/N didn\u2019t know what he was thinking or even <i>how</i> he was feeling recently. </p><p>\u201c<b><i>You know what?\u201d</i></b> Y/N said, clearing her throat. Darren raised an eyebrow at her.<i><b> \u201cI think it would be gr\u2013\u201d </b></i></p><p>Both of them glanced at her left hand where she clutched her phone. She gives him a sheepish smile. He must be so annoyed at her. </p><p>\u201c<i>Hey y/n, wanna hang out this friday? :))</i></p><p><i>Luna\u2019s going out with her friends</i></p><p><i>It\u2019s ok if u dont wanna :/\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<b><i>Um actually, I can\u2019t. Maybe next time,</i></b>\u201d Y/N finally responded, bashfully might she add. She could feel her plump cheeks heating up as if a space heater hit her at full blast, making her cheeks pink. </p><p>\u201c<i>It\u2019s alright. Maybe next time, </i>\u201c Darren repeated. She could see the twinkle in his eyes dispersing a bit and his body to be slouching just an inch shorter. However, she couldn\u2019t find it in herself to care about him; not when Harry had planted himself back in her otherwise boring life. </p><p>Yes, it was a bit pitying for Y/N to just let Harry in again despite his actions, but she couldn\u2019t help it. She really does miss him and she\u2019s sure that Harry will explain himself.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>It was finally Friday and Y/N was bouncing on her toes, excited about tonight\u2019s event. She still had a couple of hours before she would be heading over to his house with a bag of goodies. The fact that she hasn\u2019t seen him in a while added spine-tingling energy bursting through her whole body. She woke up on the right side of the bed, the sun peeked through her blinds in the right amounts so she wasn\u2019t blinded. The weather was perfect because when Y/N missed slipping her feet in her fuzzy slippers, her sole was met with a warmness that would usually be a frigid platform. So yes, her mood was elevated profoundly and it was all because of Harry.</p><p>She made her breakfast while she was swaying her hips to the beat of the song from her playlist. Y/N thought about how he was able to take her sucky week and do a complete 180. That was when she had to accept another fate; that she was\u2013no doubt\u2013 absolutely in love with him that she was willing to brush his misdemeanors off of her shoulder just like that. She couldn\u2019t find one bone in her body to hate him and she didn\u2019t even reprimand herself for feeling that way because the love she\u2019d grown for him overpowered any other emotion. She was sure that she\u2019d resemble a heart-eyed emoji right now. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Y/N was giddy, she could feel it throughout her entire body. Her skin was buzzing against her pajamas that she\u2019d worn underneath a layer of clothes to keep her warm. Her fingers pressed the doorbell by the side of the frame. A smile was basically plastered on her face and her cheeks were getting sore for sure yet Y/N\u2019s expression stayed the same despite the cold nipping at her exposed skin. She waited for the porch lights to turn on, indicating that he had let his eye peep through the hole on the door to see her face. For what seemed like five minutes, she stood there in her boots, having already rung the bell twice and her happy expression steadily sagged into one of worry, anxiousness, and disappointment. <i>Did he forget or did he just not hear her?</i> She hoped for the latter because after all, being forgotten was solid evidence of her not being a priority in his life anymore. </p><p>The sun had already started setting when she stepped foot outside her apartment and locked the doors so it was no surprise that the night sky had immersed itself in a blanket full of stars, dimly reflecting off of shiny windshields of the cars parked in the driveway. The street lights were her only source of metaphorical warmth. His car was here, so <i>why wasn\u2019t he answering the door?</i></p><p>It had been ten minutes later when Y/N heard the clicks of the locks from the other side of the door from her position, butt frozen sitting on the wooden staircase leading up to his front door. She had tightened the hood of her sweater over her head and her hands were shoved in the pockets to conserve heat after she spent time contacting him on her phone to which she got no reply. </p><p><i>\u201cY/N,\u201d</i> He breathed out. She stood up quickly, almost slipping at the abruptness and for a moment she saw stars circling in front of her eyes but she steadied herself. </p><p><b><i>\u201cWhat took you so long?</i></b>\u201d She muttered while bending down to get the bag of food. Standing up straighter, he could see that he was matching her; grey sweatpants and a t-shirt.</p><p><i>\u201cJ-just doing some stuff around the house,</i>\u201d He leaned in for a hug after she had kicked off her shoes messily to the side. Her coat hung on the rack and the heat of Harry\u2019s home made her stomach feel fuzzy. Y/N succumbed immediately into his warm hug, nuzzling her face into his neck like she always does. <i>\u201cMissed you, lovie\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<b><i>Missed you too, H\u201d</i></b> It was a deja-vu moment for her, mind flashing back to the airport a couple of weeks ago. But he was here now, he wasn\u2019t going to leave her to run off with Luna; he was hers for the time being and she damn as hell going to make sure that every second with him was spent well. </p><p>She felt the familiar knack in his arms as he tightened the length of it around her body, his hair tickling her face in the slightest ways, bodies pressed together so near that it felt like they were one. Y/N breathed in deeply, searching for his scent that filled her nostrils and made her heart beat calmly. When she did, it was different. It was sweet in a sense, a robust aroma wafting off of his neck, something raw and metallic; unfamiliar.</p><p>Her sock-covered feet padded against the marble flooring, bag rusting as she swayed it while she walked. Her voice resonated in the large room in question about how he was doing and what he had been up to that he took such a long time to get the door. She got her answer not a second later, not from the deep rumbling of his chest, but the sight in front of her. </p><p>Y/N\u2019s head tilted to the side in confusion of seeing the back of Luna\u2019s head as she scavenged the refrigerator for food. She turned around to face Harry, eyebrows raising as if to say <i>\u2018what is she doing here?</i>\u2019. He was about to open his mouth when Luna closed the fridge door. </p><p><i>\u201cHarry, you have no more bread</i>,\u201d Luna whined out, not facing their direction yet. </p><p>\u201c<i>Sorry, babe. We\u2019ll buy more tomorrow,\u201d</i> \u00a0She turned around then, eyes going wide in the surprise of seeing Y/N. </p><p>\u201c<i>Oh, hi Y/N!</i>\u201d Luna greeted her, long legs taking strides to pull Y/N in for an embrace. She was stuck frozen, trying to decipher what was currently happening. </p><p>\u201c<i>Luna\u2019s friends canceled so she\u2019s staying with us tonight,</i>\u201d Y/N could feel a drought simpering in her throat. </p><p>\u201c<i>I hope that\u2019s okay</i>,\u201d Luna continued, concern flooding her beautiful features as she stared at Y/N. </p><p>Harry wasn\u2019t doing <i>something</i>, he was doing <i>someone</i>. Luna. That would certainly explain why she was wearing an oversized jumper stopping mid-thigh, probably underwear, and some socks; it was Harry\u2019s jumper, Y/N concludes because she wore the same one when she complained about being cold one night in his house. It would explain her messy hair, tinted cheeks, and the dazed look in her eyes. They fucked before she got here, that\u2019s why he couldn\u2019t answer the door. Y/N felt disgusting, turning her body fully to face him, inspecting him. His t-shirt was wrinkled, allowing her to see (at close distance) a bruise forming on his neck and clavicle, his hair was <i>sex</i> hair and that god-awful smell she was whiffing was the smell of <i>sex</i>. A shiver ran down her spine at the thought of their actions and the fact that he held her close minutes after he finished with <i>her</i>. As if he needed a hug like the one they shared; full of love and emotion of missing each others\u2019 presence because Y/N certainly did, but him, it was an ordinary action probably acted on through kindness because he didn\u2019t need her anymore. He didn\u2019t need love sprouting from Y/N because he can get it from someone else. A separate devastation harnessed its way into her heart at the visual of a man that she was so helplessly besotted with sharing an intimate action with someone he had known for only months.</p><p>\u201c<b><i>Y-yes of course,</i></b>\u201d Y/N swallowed thickly, still trying to wrap her mind around the context. Her eyes found Harry\u2019s which were filled with worry, begging her to let him explain <i>what the hell just happened.</i></p><p><i>\u201cGreat! Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll take care of the food, you guys make yourselves comfortable,\u201d</i> Luna beamed, shooing the both of them away from the kitchen and towards the living room but not before grabbing Harry\u2019s shirt and giving him a kiss on the lips. </p><p>\u2014\u2013</p><p>As soon as Y/N thought that they would be out of earshot, she instantaneously turned around to face Harry who was following her closely. </p><p><b><i>\u201cWhat the hell, Harry? You said she was going out, that it would just be the both of us,\u201d</i></b> Y/N sneered, hands waving in frustration. </p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Y/N. Her plans fell through and she was already here anyways so I thought that you wouldn\u2019t mind if she joined us, \u201c</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cI just thought it\u2019d be the two of us,\u201d</i></b></p><p>\u201c<i>What\u2019s wrong with having her here?</i>\u201d He challenged her, eyebrows rising from their usual place. Y/N gulped heavily, choosing to be careful with her words. </p><p><b><i>\u201cNothing is wrong with her being here,\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cI wanted it to be like old times, you know?\u201d </i></b></p><p>Harry sighed deeply. His legs leading him to stand in front of her, tilting her chin up so she could see the sincerity behind them. </p><p>\u201c<i>Look Y/N, it\u2019s going to be different now,\u201d</i> His tone sounded like he was speaking to a child. \u201c<i>Luna and I are together and there\u2019s going to be some changes between\u2013 between us,\u201d</i></p><p><b>\u201c</b><i><b>I </b>know<b>, Harry. I\u2019m not expecting you to invite me every time. I haven\u2019t seen you in so long and she just comes here and take\u2013 spends her time with you and I barely get to see you, H\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cIf this is because of what I said to</i> y<i>ou before,</i> \u201c And she knew that he was talking about her confession. <i>\u201cFeelings change and sometimes you can\u2019t control it. I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you, Y/N. I wasn\u2019t ready to commit again,\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<b><i>That\u2019s beside the point!\u201d</i></b> Her voice reached a new volume and Harry shot her a warning glance to keep her voice down. <b><i>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if I told you about my feelings or not. What matters is you keep ditching me for her, canceling our plans because she wanted you to stay by her side.\u201d</i></b></p><p><i><b>\u201cI get that you guys are a couple but I feel like I\u2019m not even important to you anymore,\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s not true, you know that\u2019s not true,</i>\u201d He protested. Y/N didn\u2019t know if he was playing dumb or if he was really that daft. </p><p><b><i>\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time we hung out together, just us?\u201d</i></b></p><p>He gaped at her, pink lips opening and closing but no sound came from his throat. </p><p><b><i>\u201cExactly, you don\u2019t even know,\u201d</i></b></p><p>\u201c<i>She\u2019s my girlfriend, Y/N. You\u2019re just my .. my friend</i>\u201d He whispered agitatedly. </p><p>Her heart cracked and the fire igniting in her was extinguished. The embers floating amidst the dry and tense atmosphere. He had hit a soft spot, he knew that but it wasn\u2019t on purpose.</p><p><i><b>\u201cR-right. Of course,</b> </i>\u201c She nodded, accepting the cold, hard facts. She couldn\u2019t do anything and besides, he was speaking the truth. He never saw her as anything more than a friend and the sooner she gets over that, the faster she can mend her broken heart and move on. </p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to,\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N held up a palm indicating him to stop talking, <b><i>\u201cNo you\u2019re right. I\u2019m just a friend, a friend that waited out in the cold tonight only to be reminded that she\u2019s never going to be anything else to you, </i></b></p><p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t put words in my mouth and I told you I was doing something</i>,\u201d It was his turn to roll his eyes. </p><p>She scoffed, <b><i>\u201cYou weren\u2019t doing something, you were doing her!\u201d</i></b></p><p>\u201c<i>We\u2019re in a relationship. It\u2019s normal</i>,\u201d He explained. </p><p><i><b>\u201cI know it is,</b></i>\u201d Y/N took his comment as a blow for her lack of companionship. <i><b>\u201cI\u2019m just saying, you left me outside in the cold to f</b>uck<b> her\u2013\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cSorry about that again,\u201d</i></p><p>She glared at him for interrupting her, \u201c<i><b>And you touched me as if you didn\u2019t just touch her minutes before! I mean </b>god<b> did you even wash your hands?\u201d</b></i></p><p>He only shook his head at her question. </p><p><b><i>\u201cThat\u2019s disgusting, Harry!\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cI said I was sorry! Why can\u2019t you accept that already?\u201d</i></p><p>She spotted the soiled couch, the cushions pressed in from the weight of Harry and Luna\u2019s bodies, the blanket was half on the couch and a half on the floor. </p><p><b><i>\u201cNot only did you take your sweet time getting to the door, but you also forgot about me these past few weeks and you know it,\u201d </i></b></p><p><i>\u201cI canceled one thing and you\u2019re acting as if I ruined this friendship,\u201d</i></p><p>She stared at him incredulously, \u201c<b><i>One? It was three, Harry! You kept saying \u2018maybe next time\u2019 but it never comes,\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cI can\u2019t just drop everything for you,\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>\u201cBut you used to\u201d </b></i></p><p>He ran a hand over his face, the stress of the conversation weighing in on him. </p><p><i>\u201cLuna, sh-she\u2019s more important now,\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m saying that I want to focus on her and me,\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cSo you\u2019re basically kicking me to the side? Because you found someone else to give you something that you can\u2019t accept from me?\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m doing, Y/N,\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<b><i>Then explain to me! Please, I\u2019m trying to understand you,\u201d</i></b> She begged him and Y/N\u2019s sure that Luna had probably heard their conversation by now. It didn\u2019t take that long to prepare the snacks.</p><p><i>\u201cI really want her and I to work,\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<b><i>I wish you the best too, you know that. I\u2019m just confused as to where I stand,</i></b>\u201d Y/N stated. \u201c<i><b>I don\u2019t want to make you choose, Har, but I need to know if you see me as a convenient person that will always catch you when you fall or if you really care about me because right now, it seems like you don't\u2019\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cI care about you and I love you, Y/N\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question, Styles,</b></i>\u201d Her eyes were stinging from the tears she was holding back. She wasn\u2019t going to give him the satisfaction of crying in front of him. \u201c<i><b>Are you keeping me around because you know I\u2019ll stay?\u201d</b></i></p><p>\u201c<b><i>Please don\u2019t take advantage of me like that.\u201d</i></b> She pleaded, a lone tear slipping down her cheek and he instinctively reached out to wipe it away; like he used to.</p><p><i>\u201cI-i\u2019m not,\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>\u201cProve it,\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cBut Y/N, you said you wouldn\u2019t make me chose</i>,\u201d His reply was an answer in itself, his actions and words were already hinting at possible disclosure between him and her, but hearing it from him made it more real. He already knew that he was going to choose Luna, but he kept Y/N around for the sake of his selfish reasons. </p><p><b><i>\u201cYou choose her, huh?\u201d</i></b></p><p>He tried to come closer to her, but every time he took a step forward, her body backed away from him. </p><p><i>\u201cI-i don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<b><i>I don\u2019t know either, H\u201d</i></b> She puffed her chest out, heart aching deeply at his words. </p><p><i>\u201cI really like her, Y/N\u201d</i></p><p>The knife in her chest twisted, breaking the pieces into sharper shards that scratch her insides, capturing her in an endless loop of pain. Everything she hoped to be, everything she desired to herself was given to somebody else and it<i>\u00a0wasn\u2019t fair</i>. It wasn\u2019t fair that she is treated so poorly right now by a man she loves and it wasn\u2019t even his fault! He\u2019s right, you can\u2019t control your feelings because Y/N still loves him the way she did before.</p><p><i><b>\u201cI know,\u201d</b></i></p><p>\u2014</p><p>It hurts. There was a hole in her chest, an abyss swallowing every emotion she felt except anger, pain, grief, loneliness, and disappointment. Those stuck around, circling her heart and making her feel bad about herself but she couldn\u2019t find anything to counteract the sorrow she was feeling. It mocked her like Harry had used her. She didn\u2019t realize it at first because it was subtle and fundamental that when she did, \u00a0it was too late to try and revive the old Y/N. She died right along when Harry chose someone else over her. </p><p>Her body ached, limbs and joints remaining in the same position for a continuous amount of time. Y/N\u2019s throat was dry, having not spoken for days\u2013having not left her place for days\u2013 and she felt like every time a word scraped by that she would break into a heaving sob, burning her lungs for air as snot filled her nostrils. She turned off her phone to disconnect herself from the outside world, surely nothing important would happen to a nobody like her; a thought that Harry further revealed as true by stepping on her and beating down on her love and trust. She refused to see herself in any reflection because she knew that she would only be met with a lifeless counterpart, a stranger staring at her because even she didn\u2019t know <i>who she was anymore.</i> It hurts when every time she closed her eyes, an image of Harry and Luna embedded itself permanently in her brain that she often had to spend nights staring at the ceiling, afraid to sleep. </p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t know if he was okay, he probably was, since she hasn\u2019t heard from anyone in days. Sometimes he would sneak into her dreams and give her a few moments to imagine a life where they were together; her dreams were a place for them to be together whereas reality only spits at her pathetic attempt of finding love. He used her for his own selfish reasons and she let him because she desired him too much. He only kept her around because she was a safety net in case anything goes wrong and she couldn\u2019t even let herself be too angry at him because <i>at least</i> he made her feel wanted. At least he trusted her with <i>him</i> himself; but he could never trust her with his heart even though she gave her own to Harry, willingly. </p><hr><p>\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p>let me know what you thought!</p><p>taglist; <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrOnqAm3S2YJtqPJmZcO4hA\">@besitostyles</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQsX6KLms40JeRDlVk6NEWQ\">@fangirl-moment-x</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmxi3QUpqS4qTJLeJ8fcoTg\">@harrysahottie</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPsz_HJ-fGqnDHAg-f46rlw\">@rosepetalumbrella</a> @evalynanne <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1fpivr--tbthEpoz43VhvA\">@ynm1505</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mh1UB6m8cO8XVhlwnfb9nIw\">@cuddlebughazza</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRQvNGuL791trMASjjacTyQ\">@pxrrishly</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgQ5EdNPkpDmT4rcK7Heukg\">@lovableah</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5YrYTiKDl0TdQIXZojMV_A\">@always-alone19</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwsID5ppi1FgvnAzeQekAZw\">@projkiwidicine</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNYxAvIQgRI_STqjv_SuZBQ\">@harrystxleslx</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0cXlYozjbqnAyl8Z2SwQEg\">@harryspirate</a> @mutuallynotmutual <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3S2pR3NTVs5Hor-c5rdmsA\">@ftinxmirx</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtsSGFroaE9zkOMCKMZWCww\">@xalittlebitofeverythingx</a></p>",

Maybe he would actually reciprocate her feelings, and maybe he wouldn\u2019t have met Luna because he had decided that his heart belonged to Y/N back home. </i></p>[[MORE]]<p>In an effort to add more people into her minuscule group of friends, Y/N had signed up for Zumba at her local community center. She was a bit iffy at first about signing up because it wasn\u2019t cheap, and Y/N would rather much buy herself some snacks at the store, but she knew that she needed to get out there in order to get her mind off of her failed confession to Harry. Ever since she first stepped into the activity room with a large mirror right in front of her, Y/N was forced to face with her reflection and watch her body move quite stiffly with the music.<br></p><p>Then, she would\u2019ve disregarded the obvious flaws because Y/N wasn\u2019t very harsh with herself and she thought that whatever is \u2018<i>wrong</i>\u2019 with her, she can improve; that\u2019s why she chose to see only the good things, thing that she liked. She was on the heavier side, a sizeable bum than most and she had a muffin top, but Y/N used those societal flaws to build herself up to be more confident. Plus, Harry always told her that she looked beautiful, and complimented her whenever he could. It wasn\u2019t that she <i>needed</i> Harry\u2019s approval to know that she\u2019s beautiful, but it definitely helped her self-esteem when someone like him made herself believe that she was worth something. So that\u2019s why she was a bit confused as to why Y/N was looking at herself right now and was only seeing the flaws she otherwise would\u2019ve ignored or maybe gaped at in a positive light. Her hips were jutting out a bit more, she noticed. A sixth sense made her feel like everybody around her was staring at her in judgment. A sane part of her knows that she was just being paranoid, but the larger half couldn\u2019t help but be more aware of her actions, taking unnecessary steps back so she wouldn\u2019t be in anyone\u2019s direct line of view.</p><p>And Y/N knew why she was perceiving this sort of emotion. She recognized that a considerable part of her was envious of Luna\u2019s appearance. Y/N wasn\u2019t anywhere near hers\u2013beauty wise\u2013so maybe that\u2019s the root of all of her negative input. She was used to it, she guesses. Being around Harry for an extensive amount of time meant that she was in a plethora of pictures, ones that were posted in media articles, newspapers, and on social media. While others ignored her visible presence of being in the background right behind him, other outlets still isolated her and made comments about who she was without really learning who she is. So yes, there are some assumptions being made and certainly are their gossips about her looks saying that she was \u2018t<i>oo ugly</i>\u2019 to be hanging out with Harry, or that she wasn\u2019t as skinny as the previous women he had linked himself to (assuming that they were dating). Like she said, it usually wouldn\u2019t disturb her or trouble her mind since Harry\u2019s reassurance echoes in her mind every time she doubted herself. It was comforting for someone to just <i>be</i> there for her, but Y/N was in slow progress of accepting the fact that he might not be there for her anymore in the v<i>ery</i> near future, she figures. </p><p>\u2014- </p><p><i>\u201cHey Y/N, are you okay? You seemed about out of it</i>,\u201d Darren, the instructor, approached her when most of the participants left the room. She was searching for the towel she was quite sure she threw in her gym bag in a rush. </p><p>\u201c<b><i>Huh? Yeah, I\u2019m okay. Thanks\u201d</i></b> Y/N smiled at him, forcing herself to converse with him although she wasn\u2019t in the best mood right now. </p><p><i>\u201cSo I was thinking, if you aren\u2019t doing anything Friday night \u2026we could maybe get dinner together,\u201d </i>Darren started, inspecting her face for any sign of discomfort from her. The last thing he wanted was for Y/N to feel uncomfortable because of him.</p><p>\u201c<b><i>Oh no, I\u2019m sorry I have plan\u2013</i></b>,\u201d Y/N trailed off, a sudden realization hitting her square in the face. Friday night used to be t<i>heir nights.</i> She closed off and rejected any invitations given to her especially on Friday\u2019s because there was no question as to whether or not she and Harry were going to hang out or not\u2013 it was always a yes. They didn\u2019t even check in on each other if they\u2019re cool for spending time together because it was such a routine that nobody dared questioned. </p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s okay if you can\u2019t, by the way</i>,\u201d He added, noticing that she was taking a pregnant pause. He shifted on his sneaker-clad feet nervously while biting his lip. </p><p><i>If he already missed three weeks in a row, what are the chances of him missing a straight fourth?</i></p><p>Y/N chuckled anxiously, not knowing whether to say yes or now. On one hand, it was a good step for her to spend Friday nights with somebody else instead of her more recent contexts where she sat on her couch alone, eating frozen meals and staring emotionlessly at a supposed \u2018<i>comedy show</i>\u2019. But on the other, there was still a slice of her endlessly hoping that Harry would somehow change his plans to include her\u2013his best friend\u2013 if she could even label herself that. It was saddening, really; she was waiting for him to (hopefully) realize that he missed her but then again, she wasn\u2019t in the place to assume anything since Y/N didn\u2019t know what he was thinking or even <i>how</i> he was feeling recently. </p><p>\u201c<b><i>You know what?\u201d</i></b> Y/N said, clearing her throat. Darren raised an eyebrow at her.<i><b> \u201cI think it would be gr\u2013\u201d </b></i></p><p>Both of them glanced at her left hand where she clutched her phone. She gives him a sheepish smile. He must be so annoyed at her. </p><p>\u201c<i>Hey y/n, wanna hang out this friday? :))</i></p><p><i>Luna\u2019s going out with her friends</i></p><p><i>It\u2019s ok if u dont wanna :/\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<b><i>Um actually, I can\u2019t. Maybe next time,</i></b>\u201d Y/N finally responded, bashfully might she add. She could feel her plump cheeks heating up as if a space heater hit her at full blast, making her cheeks pink. </p><p>\u201c<i>It\u2019s alright. Maybe next time, </i>\u201c Darren repeated. She could see the twinkle in his eyes dispersing a bit and his body to be slouching just an inch shorter. However, she couldn\u2019t find it in herself to care about him; not when Harry had planted himself back in her otherwise boring life. </p><p>Yes, it was a bit pitying for Y/N to just let Harry in again despite his actions, but she couldn\u2019t help it. She really does miss him and she\u2019s sure that Harry will explain himself.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>It was finally Friday and Y/N was bouncing on her toes, excited about tonight\u2019s event. She still had a couple of hours before she would be heading over to his house with a bag of goodies. The fact that she hasn\u2019t seen him in a while added spine-tingling energy bursting through her whole body. She woke up on the right side of the bed, the sun peeked through her blinds in the right amounts so she wasn\u2019t blinded. The weather was perfect because when Y/N missed slipping her feet in her fuzzy slippers, her sole was met with a warmness that would usually be a frigid platform. So yes, her mood was elevated profoundly and it was all because of Harry.</p><p>She made her breakfast while she was swaying her hips to the beat of the song from her playlist. Y/N thought about how he was able to take her sucky week and do a complete 180. That was when she had to accept another fate; that she was\u2013no doubt\u2013 absolutely in love with him that she was willing to brush his misdemeanors off of her shoulder just like that. She couldn\u2019t find one bone in her body to hate him and she didn\u2019t even reprimand herself for feeling that way because the love she\u2019d grown for him overpowered any other emotion. She was sure that she\u2019d resemble a heart-eyed emoji right now. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Y/N was giddy, she could feel it throughout her entire body. Her skin was buzzing against her pajamas that she\u2019d worn underneath a layer of clothes to keep her warm. Her fingers pressed the doorbell by the side of the frame. A smile was basically plastered on her face and her cheeks were getting sore for sure yet Y/N\u2019s expression stayed the same despite the cold nipping at her exposed skin. She waited for the porch lights to turn on, indicating that he had let his eye peep through the hole on the door to see her face. For what seemed like five minutes, she stood there in her boots, having already rung the bell twice and her happy expression steadily sagged into one of worry, anxiousness, and disappointment. <i>Did he forget or did he just not hear her?</i> She hoped for the latter because after all, being forgotten was solid evidence of her not being a priority in his life anymore. </p><p>The sun had already started setting when she stepped foot outside her apartment and locked the doors so it was no surprise that the night sky had immersed itself in a blanket full of stars, dimly reflecting off of shiny windshields of the cars parked in the driveway. The street lights were her only source of metaphorical warmth. His car was here, so <i>why wasn\u2019t he answering the door?</i></p><p>It had been ten minutes later when Y/N heard the clicks of the locks from the other side of the door from her position, butt frozen sitting on the wooden staircase leading up to his front door. She had tightened the hood of her sweater over her head and her hands were shoved in the pockets to conserve heat after she spent time contacting him on her phone to which she got no reply. </p><p><i>\u201cY/N,\u201d</i> He breathed out. She stood up quickly, almost slipping at the abruptness and for a moment she saw stars circling in front of her eyes but she steadied herself. </p><p><b><i>\u201cWhat took you so long?</i></b>\u201d She muttered while bending down to get the bag of food. Standing up straighter, he could see that he was matching her; grey sweatpants and a t-shirt.</p><p><i>\u201cJ-just doing some stuff around the house,</i>\u201d He leaned in for a hug after she had kicked off her shoes messily to the side. Her coat hung on the rack and the heat of Harry\u2019s home made her stomach feel fuzzy. Y/N succumbed immediately into his warm hug, nuzzling her face into his neck like she always does. <i>\u201cMissed you, lovie\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<b><i>Missed you too, H\u201d</i></b> It was a deja-vu moment for her, mind flashing back to the airport a couple of weeks ago. But he was here now, he wasn\u2019t going to leave her to run off with Luna; he was hers for the time being and she damn as hell going to make sure that every second with him was spent well. </p><p>She felt the familiar knack in his arms as he tightened the length of it around her body, his hair tickling her face in the slightest ways, bodies pressed together so near that it felt like they were one. Y/N breathed in deeply, searching for his scent that filled her nostrils and made her heart beat calmly. When she did, it was different. It was sweet in a sense, a robust aroma wafting off of his neck, something raw and metallic; unfamiliar.</p><p>Her sock-covered feet padded against the marble flooring, bag rusting as she swayed it while she walked. Her voice resonated in the large room in question about how he was doing and what he had been up to that he took such a long time to get the door. She got her answer not a second later, not from the deep rumbling of his chest, but the sight in front of her. </p><p>Y/N\u2019s head tilted to the side in confusion of seeing the back of Luna\u2019s head as she scavenged the refrigerator for food. She turned around to face Harry, eyebrows raising as if to say <i>\u2018what is she doing here?</i>\u2019. He was about to open his mouth when Luna closed the fridge door. </p><p><i>\u201cHarry, you have no more bread</i>,\u201d Luna whined out, not facing their direction yet. </p><p>\u201c<i>Sorry, babe. We\u2019ll buy more tomorrow,\u201d</i> \u00a0She turned around then, eyes going wide in the surprise of seeing Y/N. </p><p>\u201c<i>Oh, hi Y/N!</i>\u201d Luna greeted her, long legs taking strides to pull Y/N in for an embrace. She was stuck frozen, trying to decipher what was currently happening. </p><p>\u201c<i>Luna\u2019s friends canceled so she\u2019s staying with us tonight,</i>\u201d Y/N could feel a drought simpering in her throat. </p><p>\u201c<i>I hope that\u2019s okay</i>,\u201d Luna continued, concern flooding her beautiful features as she stared at Y/N. </p><p>Harry wasn\u2019t doing <i>something</i>, he was doing <i>someone</i>. Luna. That would certainly explain why she was wearing an oversized jumper stopping mid-thigh, probably underwear, and some socks; it was Harry\u2019s jumper, Y/N concludes because she wore the same one when she complained about being cold one night in his house. It would explain her messy hair, tinted cheeks, and the dazed look in her eyes. They fucked before she got here, that\u2019s why he couldn\u2019t answer the door. Y/N felt disgusting, turning her body fully to face him, inspecting him. His t-shirt was wrinkled, allowing her to see (at close distance) a bruise forming on his neck and clavicle, his hair was <i>sex</i> hair and that god-awful smell she was whiffing was the smell of <i>sex</i>. A shiver ran down her spine at the thought of their actions and the fact that he held her close minutes after he finished with <i>her</i>. As if he needed a hug like the one they shared; full of love and emotion of missing each others\u2019 presence because Y/N certainly did, but him, it was an ordinary action probably acted on through kindness because he didn\u2019t need her anymore. He didn\u2019t need love sprouting from Y/N because he can get it from someone else. A separate devastation harnessed its way into her heart at the visual of a man that she was so helplessly besotted with sharing an intimate action with someone he had known for only months.</p><p>\u201c<b><i>Y-yes of course,</i></b>\u201d Y/N swallowed thickly, still trying to wrap her mind around the context. Her eyes found Harry\u2019s which were filled with worry, begging her to let him explain <i>what the hell just happened.</i></p><p><i>\u201cGreat! Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll take care of the food, you guys make yourselves comfortable,\u201d</i> Luna beamed, shooing the both of them away from the kitchen and towards the living room but not before grabbing Harry\u2019s shirt and giving him a kiss on the lips. </p><p>\u2014\u2013</p><p>As soon as Y/N thought that they would be out of earshot, she instantaneously turned around to face Harry who was following her closely. </p><p><b><i>\u201cWhat the hell, Harry? You said she was going out, that it would just be the both of us,\u201d</i></b> Y/N sneered, hands waving in frustration. </p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Y/N. Her plans fell through and she was already here anyways so I thought that you wouldn\u2019t mind if she joined us, \u201c</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cI just thought it\u2019d be the two of us,\u201d</i></b></p><p>\u201c<i>What\u2019s wrong with having her here?</i>\u201d He challenged her, eyebrows rising from their usual place. Y/N gulped heavily, choosing to be careful with her words. </p><p><b><i>\u201cNothing is wrong with her being here,\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cI wanted it to be like old times, you know?\u201d </i></b></p><p>Harry sighed deeply. His legs leading him to stand in front of her, tilting her chin up so she could see the sincerity behind them. </p><p>\u201c<i>Look Y/N, it\u2019s going to be different now,\u201d</i> His tone sounded like he was speaking to a child. \u201c<i>Luna and I are together and there\u2019s going to be some changes between\u2013 between us,\u201d</i></p><p><b>\u201c</b><i><b>I </b>know<b>, Harry. I\u2019m not expecting you to invite me every time. I haven\u2019t seen you in so long and she just comes here and take\u2013 spends her time with you and I barely get to see you, H\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cIf this is because of what I said to</i> y<i>ou before,</i> \u201c And she knew that he was talking about her confession. <i>\u201cFeelings change and sometimes you can\u2019t control it. I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you, Y/N. I wasn\u2019t ready to commit again,\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<b><i>That\u2019s beside the point!\u201d</i></b> Her voice reached a new volume and Harry shot her a warning glance to keep her voice down. <b><i>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if I told you about my feelings or not. What matters is you keep ditching me for her, canceling our plans because she wanted you to stay by her side.\u201d</i></b></p><p><i><b>\u201cI get that you guys are a couple but I feel like I\u2019m not even important to you anymore,\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s not true, you know that\u2019s not true,</i>\u201d He protested. Y/N didn\u2019t know if he was playing dumb or if he was really that daft. </p><p><b><i>\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time we hung out together, just us?\u201d</i></b></p><p>He gaped at her, pink lips opening and closing but no sound came from his throat. </p><p><b><i>\u201cExactly, you don\u2019t even know,\u201d</i></b></p><p>\u201c<i>She\u2019s my girlfriend, Y/N. You\u2019re just my .. my friend</i>\u201d He whispered agitatedly. </p><p>Her heart cracked and the fire igniting in her was extinguished. The embers floating amidst the dry and tense atmosphere. He had hit a soft spot, he knew that but it wasn\u2019t on purpose.</p><p><i><b>\u201cR-right. Of course,</b> </i>\u201c She nodded, accepting the cold, hard facts. She couldn\u2019t do anything and besides, he was speaking the truth. He never saw her as anything more than a friend and the sooner she gets over that, the faster she can mend her broken heart and move on. </p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to,\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N held up a palm indicating him to stop talking, <b><i>\u201cNo you\u2019re right. I\u2019m just a friend, a friend that waited out in the cold tonight only to be reminded that she\u2019s never going to be anything else to you, </i></b></p><p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t put words in my mouth and I told you I was doing something</i>,\u201d It was his turn to roll his eyes. </p><p>She scoffed, <b><i>\u201cYou weren\u2019t doing something, you were doing her!\u201d</i></b></p><p>\u201c<i>We\u2019re in a relationship. It\u2019s normal</i>,\u201d He explained. </p><p><i><b>\u201cI know it is,</b></i>\u201d Y/N took his comment as a blow for her lack of companionship. <i><b>\u201cI\u2019m just saying, you left me outside in the cold to f</b>uck<b> her\u2013\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cSorry about that again,\u201d</i></p><p>She glared at him for interrupting her, \u201c<i><b>And you touched me as if you didn\u2019t just touch her minutes before! I mean </b>god<b> did you even wash your hands?\u201d</b></i></p><p>He only shook his head at her question. </p><p><b><i>\u201cThat\u2019s disgusting, Harry!\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cI said I was sorry! Why can\u2019t you accept that already?\u201d</i></p><p>She spotted the soiled couch, the cushions pressed in from the weight of Harry and Luna\u2019s bodies, the blanket was half on the couch and a half on the floor. </p><p><b><i>\u201cNot only did you take your sweet time getting to the door, but you also forgot about me these past few weeks and you know it,\u201d </i></b></p><p><i>\u201cI canceled one thing and you\u2019re acting as if I ruined this friendship,\u201d</i></p><p>She stared at him incredulously, \u201c<b><i>One? It was three, Harry! You kept saying \u2018maybe next time\u2019 but it never comes,\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cI can\u2019t just drop everything for you,\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>\u201cBut you used to\u201d </b></i></p><p>He ran a hand over his face, the stress of the conversation weighing in on him. </p><p><i>\u201cLuna, sh-she\u2019s more important now,\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m saying that I want to focus on her and me,\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cSo you\u2019re basically kicking me to the side? Because you found someone else to give you something that you can\u2019t accept from me?\u201d</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m doing, Y/N,\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<b><i>Then explain to me! Please, I\u2019m trying to understand you,\u201d</i></b> She begged him and Y/N\u2019s sure that Luna had probably heard their conversation by now. It didn\u2019t take that long to prepare the snacks.</p><p><i>\u201cI really want her and I to work,\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<b><i>I wish you the best too, you know that. I\u2019m just confused as to where I stand,</i></b>\u201d Y/N stated. \u201c<i><b>I don\u2019t want to make you choose, Har, but I need to know if you see me as a convenient person that will always catch you when you fall or if you really care about me because right now, it seems like you don't\u2019\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cI care about you and I love you, Y/N\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question, Styles,</b></i>\u201d Her eyes were stinging from the tears she was holding back. She wasn\u2019t going to give him the satisfaction of crying in front of him. \u201c<i><b>Are you keeping me around because you know I\u2019ll stay?\u201d</b></i></p><p>\u201c<b><i>Please don\u2019t take advantage of me like that.\u201d</i></b> She pleaded, a lone tear slipping down her cheek and he instinctively reached out to wipe it away; like he used to.</p><p><i>\u201cI-i\u2019m not,\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>\u201cProve it,\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cBut Y/N, you said you wouldn\u2019t make me chose</i>,\u201d His reply was an answer in itself, his actions and words were already hinting at possible disclosure between him and her, but hearing it from him made it more real. He already knew that he was going to choose Luna, but he kept Y/N around for the sake of his selfish reasons. </p><p><b><i>\u201cYou choose her, huh?\u201d</i></b></p><p>He tried to come closer to her, but every time he took a step forward, her body backed away from him. </p><p><i>\u201cI-i don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<b><i>I don\u2019t know either, H\u201d</i></b> She puffed her chest out, heart aching deeply at his words. </p><p><i>\u201cI really like her, Y/N\u201d</i></p><p>The knife in her chest twisted, breaking the pieces into sharper shards that scratch her insides, capturing her in an endless loop of pain. Everything she hoped to be, everything she desired to herself was given to somebody else and it<i>\u00a0wasn\u2019t fair</i>. It wasn\u2019t fair that she is treated so poorly right now by a man she loves and it wasn\u2019t even his fault! He\u2019s right, you can\u2019t control your feelings because Y/N still loves him the way she did before.</p><p><i><b>\u201cI know,\u201d</b></i></p><p>\u2014</p><p>It hurts. There was a hole in her chest, an abyss swallowing every emotion she felt except anger, pain, grief, loneliness, and disappointment. Those stuck around, circling her heart and making her feel bad about herself but she couldn\u2019t find anything to counteract the sorrow she was feeling. It mocked her like Harry had used her. She didn\u2019t realize it at first because it was subtle and fundamental that when she did, \u00a0it was too late to try and revive the old Y/N. She died right along when Harry chose someone else over her. </p><p>Her body ached, limbs and joints remaining in the same position for a continuous amount of time. Y/N\u2019s throat was dry, having not spoken for days\u2013having not left her place for days\u2013 and she felt like every time a word scraped by that she would break into a heaving sob, burning her lungs for air as snot filled her nostrils. She turned off her phone to disconnect herself from the outside world, surely nothing important would happen to a nobody like her; a thought that Harry further revealed as true by stepping on her and beating down on her love and trust. She refused to see herself in any reflection because she knew that she would only be met with a lifeless counterpart, a stranger staring at her because even she didn\u2019t know <i>who she was anymore.</i> It hurts when every time she closed her eyes, an image of Harry and Luna embedded itself permanently in her brain that she often had to spend nights staring at the ceiling, afraid to sleep. </p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t know if he was okay, he probably was, since she hasn\u2019t heard from anyone in days. Sometimes he would sneak into her dreams and give her a few moments to imagine a life where they were together; her dreams were a place for them to be together whereas reality only spits at her pathetic attempt of finding love. He used her for his own selfish reasons and she let him because she desired him too much. He only kept her around because she was a safety net in case anything goes wrong and she couldn\u2019t even let herself be too angry at him because <i>at least</i> he made her feel wanted. At least he trusted her with <i>him</i> himself; but he could never trust her with his heart even though she gave her own to Harry, willingly. </p><hr><p>\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p>let me know what you thought!</p><p>taglist; <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrOnqAm3S2YJtqPJmZcO4hA\">@besitostyles</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQsX6KLms40JeRDlVk6NEWQ\">@fangirl-moment-x</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmxi3QUpqS4qTJLeJ8fcoTg\">@harrysahottie</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPsz_HJ-fGqnDHAg-f46rlw\">@rosepetalumbrella</a> @evalynanne <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1fpivr--tbthEpoz43VhvA\">@ynm1505</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mh1UB6m8cO8XVhlwnfb9nIw\">@cuddlebughazza</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRQvNGuL791trMASjjacTyQ\">@pxrrishly</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgQ5EdNPkpDmT4rcK7Heukg\">@lovableah</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5YrYTiKDl0TdQIXZojMV_A\">@always-alone19</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwsID5ppi1FgvnAzeQekAZw\">@projkiwidicine</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNYxAvIQgRI_STqjv_SuZBQ\">@harrystxleslx</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0cXlYozjbqnAyl8Z2SwQEg\">@harryspirate</a> @mutuallynotmutual <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3S2pR3NTVs5Hor-c5rdmsA\">@ftinxmirx</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtsSGFroaE9zkOMCKMZWCww\">@xalittlebitofeverythingx</a></p>",
                "content": "<p><b><i>Summary: Harry and Y/N haven&rsquo;t seen each other in a while</i></b></p><p><b><i>Warnings: angst</i></b></p><p><b><i>Word Count: 4.1k</i></b></p><p><i>In a perfect world, Y/N would&rsquo;ve had the courage to confess&ndash; again&ndash; but maybe when the circumstances were a bit better than they were before. Maybe he would actually reciprocate her feelings, and maybe he wouldn&rsquo;t have met Luna because he had decided that his heart belonged to Y/N back home. </i></p><p>In an effort to add more people into her minuscule group of friends, Y/N had signed up for Zumba at her local community center. She was a bit iffy at first about signing up because it wasn&rsquo;t cheap, and Y/N would rather much buy herself some snacks at the store, but she knew that she needed to get out there in order to get her mind off of her failed confession to Harry. Ever since she first stepped into the activity room with a large mirror right in front of her, Y/N was forced to face with her reflection and watch her body move quite stiffly with the music.<br /></p><p>Then, she would&rsquo;ve disregarded the obvious flaws because Y/N wasn&rsquo;t very harsh with herself and she thought that whatever is &lsquo;<i>wrong</i>&rsquo; with her, she can improve; that&rsquo;s why she chose to see only the good things, thing that she liked. She was on the heavier side, a sizeable bum than most and she had a muffin top, but Y/N used those societal flaws to build herself up to be more confident. Plus, Harry always told her that she looked beautiful, and complimented her whenever he could. It wasn&rsquo;t that she <i>needed</i> Harry&rsquo;s approval to know that she&rsquo;s beautiful, but it definitely helped her self-esteem when someone like him made herself believe that she was worth something. So that&rsquo;s why she was a bit confused as to why Y/N was looking at herself right now and was only seeing the flaws she otherwise would&rsquo;ve ignored or maybe gaped at in a positive light. Her hips were jutting out a bit more, she noticed. A sixth sense made her feel like everybody around her was staring at her in judgment. A sane part of her knows that she was just being paranoid, but the larger half couldn&rsquo;t help but be more aware of her actions, taking unnecessary steps back so she wouldn&rsquo;t be in anyone&rsquo;s direct line of view.</p><p>And Y/N knew why she was perceiving this sort of emotion. She recognized that a considerable part of her was envious of Luna&rsquo;s appearance. Y/N wasn&rsquo;t anywhere near hers&ndash;beauty wise&ndash;so maybe that&rsquo;s the root of all of her negative input. She was used to it, she guesses. Being around Harry for an extensive amount of time meant that she was in a plethora of pictures, ones that were posted in media articles, newspapers, and on social media. While others ignored her visible presence of being in the background right behind him, other outlets still isolated her and made comments about who she was without really learning who she is. So yes, there are some assumptions being made and certainly are their gossips about her looks saying that she was &lsquo;t<i>oo ugly</i>&rsquo; to be hanging out with Harry, or that she wasn&rsquo;t as skinny as the previous women he had linked himself to (assuming that they were dating). Like she said, it usually wouldn&rsquo;t disturb her or trouble her mind since Harry&rsquo;s reassurance echoes in her mind every time she doubted herself. It was comforting for someone to just <i>be</i> there for her, but Y/N was in slow progress of accepting the fact that he might not be there for her anymore in the v<i>ery</i> near future, she figures. </p><p>&mdash;- </p><p><i>&ldquo;Hey Y/N, are you okay? You seemed about out of it</i>,&rdquo; Darren, the instructor, approached her when most of the participants left the room. She was searching for the towel she was quite sure she threw in her gym bag in a rush. </p><p>&ldquo;<b><i>Huh? Yeah, I&rsquo;m okay. Thanks&rdquo;</i></b> Y/N smiled at him, forcing herself to converse with him although she wasn&rsquo;t in the best mood right now. </p><p><i>&ldquo;So I was thinking, if you aren&rsquo;t doing anything Friday night &hellip;we could maybe get dinner together,&rdquo; </i>Darren started, inspecting her face for any sign of discomfort from her. The last thing he wanted was for Y/N to feel uncomfortable because of him.</p><p>&ldquo;<b><i>Oh no, I&rsquo;m sorry I have plan&ndash;</i></b>,&rdquo; Y/N trailed off, a sudden realization hitting her square in the face. Friday night used to be t<i>heir nights.</i> She closed off and rejected any invitations given to her especially on Friday&rsquo;s because there was no question as to whether or not she and Harry were going to hang out or not&ndash; it was always a yes. They didn&rsquo;t even check in on each other if they&rsquo;re cool for spending time together because it was such a routine that nobody dared questioned. </p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay if you can&rsquo;t, by the way</i>,&rdquo; He added, noticing that she was taking a pregnant pause. He shifted on his sneaker-clad feet nervously while biting his lip. </p><p><i>If he already missed three weeks in a row, what are the chances of him missing a straight fourth?</i></p><p>Y/N chuckled anxiously, not knowing whether to say yes or now. On one hand, it was a good step for her to spend Friday nights with somebody else instead of her more recent contexts where she sat on her couch alone, eating frozen meals and staring emotionlessly at a supposed &lsquo;<i>comedy show</i>&rsquo;. But on the other, there was still a slice of her endlessly hoping that Harry would somehow change his plans to include her&ndash;his best friend&ndash; if she could even label herself that. It was saddening, really; she was waiting for him to (hopefully) realize that he missed her but then again, she wasn&rsquo;t in the place to assume anything since Y/N didn&rsquo;t know what he was thinking or even <i>how</i> he was feeling recently. </p><p>&ldquo;<b><i>You know what?&rdquo;</i></b> Y/N said, clearing her throat. Darren raised an eyebrow at her.<i><b> &ldquo;I think it would be gr&ndash;&rdquo; </b></i></p><p>Both of them glanced at her left hand where she clutched her phone. She gives him a sheepish smile. He must be so annoyed at her. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Hey y/n, wanna hang out this friday? :))</i></p><p><i>Luna&rsquo;s going out with her friends</i></p><p><i>It&rsquo;s ok if u dont wanna :/&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;<b><i>Um actually, I can&rsquo;t. Maybe next time,</i></b>&rdquo; Y/N finally responded, bashfully might she add. She could feel her plump cheeks heating up as if a space heater hit her at full blast, making her cheeks pink. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>It&rsquo;s alright. Maybe next time, </i>&ldquo; Darren repeated. She could see the twinkle in his eyes dispersing a bit and his body to be slouching just an inch shorter. However, she couldn&rsquo;t find it in herself to care about him; not when Harry had planted himself back in her otherwise boring life. </p><p>Yes, it was a bit pitying for Y/N to just let Harry in again despite his actions, but she couldn&rsquo;t help it. She really does miss him and she&rsquo;s sure that Harry will explain himself.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>It was finally Friday and Y/N was bouncing on her toes, excited about tonight&rsquo;s event. She still had a couple of hours before she would be heading over to his house with a bag of goodies. The fact that she hasn&rsquo;t seen him in a while added spine-tingling energy bursting through her whole body. She woke up on the right side of the bed, the sun peeked through her blinds in the right amounts so she wasn&rsquo;t blinded. The weather was perfect because when Y/N missed slipping her feet in her fuzzy slippers, her sole was met with a warmness that would usually be a frigid platform. So yes, her mood was elevated profoundly and it was all because of Harry.</p><p>She made her breakfast while she was swaying her hips to the beat of the song from her playlist. Y/N thought about how he was able to take her sucky week and do a complete 180. That was when she had to accept another fate; that she was&ndash;no doubt&ndash; absolutely in love with him that she was willing to brush his misdemeanors off of her shoulder just like that. She couldn&rsquo;t find one bone in her body to hate him and she didn&rsquo;t even reprimand herself for feeling that way because the love she&rsquo;d grown for him overpowered any other emotion. She was sure that she&rsquo;d resemble a heart-eyed emoji right now. </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Y/N was giddy, she could feel it throughout her entire body. Her skin was buzzing against her pajamas that she&rsquo;d worn underneath a layer of clothes to keep her warm. Her fingers pressed the doorbell by the side of the frame. A smile was basically plastered on her face and her cheeks were getting sore for sure yet Y/N&rsquo;s expression stayed the same despite the cold nipping at her exposed skin. She waited for the porch lights to turn on, indicating that he had let his eye peep through the hole on the door to see her face. For what seemed like five minutes, she stood there in her boots, having already rung the bell twice and her happy expression steadily sagged into one of worry, anxiousness, and disappointment. <i>Did he forget or did he just not hear her?</i> She hoped for the latter because after all, being forgotten was solid evidence of her not being a priority in his life anymore. </p><p>The sun had already started setting when she stepped foot outside her apartment and locked the doors so it was no surprise that the night sky had immersed itself in a blanket full of stars, dimly reflecting off of shiny windshields of the cars parked in the driveway. The street lights were her only source of metaphorical warmth. His car was here, so <i>why wasn&rsquo;t he answering the door?</i></p><p>It had been ten minutes later when Y/N heard the clicks of the locks from the other side of the door from her position, butt frozen sitting on the wooden staircase leading up to his front door. She had tightened the hood of her sweater over her head and her hands were shoved in the pockets to conserve heat after she spent time contacting him on her phone to which she got no reply. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Y/N,&rdquo;</i> He breathed out. She stood up quickly, almost slipping at the abruptness and for a moment she saw stars circling in front of her eyes but she steadied herself. </p><p><b><i>&ldquo;What took you so long?</i></b>&rdquo; She muttered while bending down to get the bag of food. Standing up straighter, he could see that he was matching her; grey sweatpants and a t-shirt.</p><p><i>&ldquo;J-just doing some stuff around the house,</i>&rdquo; He leaned in for a hug after she had kicked off her shoes messily to the side. Her coat hung on the rack and the heat of Harry&rsquo;s home made her stomach feel fuzzy. Y/N succumbed immediately into his warm hug, nuzzling her face into his neck like she always does. <i>&ldquo;Missed you, lovie&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;<b><i>Missed you too, H&rdquo;</i></b> It was a deja-vu moment for her, mind flashing back to the airport a couple of weeks ago. But he was here now, he wasn&rsquo;t going to leave her to run off with Luna; he was hers for the time being and she damn as hell going to make sure that every second with him was spent well. </p><p>She felt the familiar knack in his arms as he tightened the length of it around her body, his hair tickling her face in the slightest ways, bodies pressed together so near that it felt like they were one. Y/N breathed in deeply, searching for his scent that filled her nostrils and made her heart beat calmly. When she did, it was different. It was sweet in a sense, a robust aroma wafting off of his neck, something raw and metallic; unfamiliar.</p><p>Her sock-covered feet padded against the marble flooring, bag rusting as she swayed it while she walked. Her voice resonated in the large room in question about how he was doing and what he had been up to that he took such a long time to get the door. She got her answer not a second later, not from the deep rumbling of his chest, but the sight in front of her. </p><p>Y/N&rsquo;s head tilted to the side in confusion of seeing the back of Luna&rsquo;s head as she scavenged the refrigerator for food. She turned around to face Harry, eyebrows raising as if to say <i>&lsquo;what is she doing here?</i>&rsquo;. He was about to open his mouth when Luna closed the fridge door. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Harry, you have no more bread</i>,&rdquo; Luna whined out, not facing their direction yet. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Sorry, babe. We&rsquo;ll buy more tomorrow,&rdquo;</i> &nbsp;She turned around then, eyes going wide in the surprise of seeing Y/N. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Oh, hi Y/N!</i>&rdquo; Luna greeted her, long legs taking strides to pull Y/N in for an embrace. She was stuck frozen, trying to decipher what was currently happening. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Luna&rsquo;s friends canceled so she&rsquo;s staying with us tonight,</i>&rdquo; Y/N could feel a drought simpering in her throat. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>I hope that&rsquo;s okay</i>,&rdquo; Luna continued, concern flooding her beautiful features as she stared at Y/N. </p><p>Harry wasn&rsquo;t doing <i>something</i>, he was doing <i>someone</i>. Luna. That would certainly explain why she was wearing an oversized jumper stopping mid-thigh, probably underwear, and some socks; it was Harry&rsquo;s jumper, Y/N concludes because she wore the same one when she complained about being cold one night in his house. It would explain her messy hair, tinted cheeks, and the dazed look in her eyes. They fucked before she got here, that&rsquo;s why he couldn&rsquo;t answer the door. Y/N felt disgusting, turning her body fully to face him, inspecting him. His t-shirt was wrinkled, allowing her to see (at close distance) a bruise forming on his neck and clavicle, his hair was <i>sex</i> hair and that god-awful smell she was whiffing was the smell of <i>sex</i>. A shiver ran down her spine at the thought of their actions and the fact that he held her close minutes after he finished with <i>her</i>. As if he needed a hug like the one they shared; full of love and emotion of missing each others&rsquo; presence because Y/N certainly did, but him, it was an ordinary action probably acted on through kindness because he didn&rsquo;t need her anymore. He didn&rsquo;t need love sprouting from Y/N because he can get it from someone else. A separate devastation harnessed its way into her heart at the visual of a man that she was so helplessly besotted with sharing an intimate action with someone he had known for only months.</p><p>&ldquo;<b><i>Y-yes of course,</i></b>&rdquo; Y/N swallowed thickly, still trying to wrap her mind around the context. Her eyes found Harry&rsquo;s which were filled with worry, begging her to let him explain <i>what the hell just happened.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Great! Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll take care of the food, you guys make yourselves comfortable,&rdquo;</i> Luna beamed, shooing the both of them away from the kitchen and towards the living room but not before grabbing Harry&rsquo;s shirt and giving him a kiss on the lips. </p><p>&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>As soon as Y/N thought that they would be out of earshot, she instantaneously turned around to face Harry who was following her closely. </p><p><b><i>&ldquo;What the hell, Harry? You said she was going out, that it would just be the both of us,&rdquo;</i></b> Y/N sneered, hands waving in frustration. </p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Y/N. Her plans fell through and she was already here anyways so I thought that you wouldn&rsquo;t mind if she joined us, &ldquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I just thought it&rsquo;d be the two of us,&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>&ldquo;<i>What&rsquo;s wrong with having her here?</i>&rdquo; He challenged her, eyebrows rising from their usual place. Y/N gulped heavily, choosing to be careful with her words. </p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Nothing is wrong with her being here,&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s the problem?&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I wanted it to be like old times, you know?&rdquo; </i></b></p><p>Harry sighed deeply. His legs leading him to stand in front of her, tilting her chin up so she could see the sincerity behind them. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Look Y/N, it&rsquo;s going to be different now,&rdquo;</i> His tone sounded like he was speaking to a child. &ldquo;<i>Luna and I are together and there&rsquo;s going to be some changes between&ndash; between us,&rdquo;</i></p><p><b>&ldquo;</b><i><b>I </b>know<b>, Harry. I&rsquo;m not expecting you to invite me every time. I haven&rsquo;t seen you in so long and she just comes here and take&ndash; spends her time with you and I barely get to see you, H&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;If this is because of what I said to</i> y<i>ou before,</i> &ldquo; And she knew that he was talking about her confession. <i>&ldquo;Feelings change and sometimes you can&rsquo;t control it. I didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt you, Y/N. I wasn&rsquo;t ready to commit again,&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;<b><i>That&rsquo;s beside the point!&rdquo;</i></b> Her voice reached a new volume and Harry shot her a warning glance to keep her voice down. <b><i>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter if I told you about my feelings or not. What matters is you keep ditching me for her, canceling our plans because she wanted you to stay by her side.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;I get that you guys are a couple but I feel like I&rsquo;m not even important to you anymore,&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true, you know that&rsquo;s not true,</i>&rdquo; He protested. Y/N didn&rsquo;t know if he was playing dumb or if he was really that daft. </p><p><b><i>&ldquo;When&rsquo;s the last time we hung out together, just us?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>He gaped at her, pink lips opening and closing but no sound came from his throat. </p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Exactly, you don&rsquo;t even know,&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>&ldquo;<i>She&rsquo;s my girlfriend, Y/N. You&rsquo;re just my .. my friend</i>&rdquo; He whispered agitatedly. </p><p>Her heart cracked and the fire igniting in her was extinguished. The embers floating amidst the dry and tense atmosphere. He had hit a soft spot, he knew that but it wasn&rsquo;t on purpose.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;R-right. Of course,</b> </i>&ldquo; She nodded, accepting the cold, hard facts. She couldn&rsquo;t do anything and besides, he was speaking the truth. He never saw her as anything more than a friend and the sooner she gets over that, the faster she can mend her broken heart and move on. </p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I didn&rsquo;t mean to,&rdquo;</i></p><p>Y/N held up a palm indicating him to stop talking, <b><i>&ldquo;No you&rsquo;re right. I&rsquo;m just a friend, a friend that waited out in the cold tonight only to be reminded that she&rsquo;s never going to be anything else to you, </i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put words in my mouth and I told you I was doing something</i>,&rdquo; It was his turn to roll his eyes. </p><p>She scoffed, <b><i>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t doing something, you were doing her!&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>&ldquo;<i>We&rsquo;re in a relationship. It&rsquo;s normal</i>,&rdquo; He explained. </p><p><i><b>&ldquo;I know it is,</b></i>&rdquo; Y/N took his comment as a blow for her lack of companionship. <i><b>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just saying, you left me outside in the cold to f</b>uck<b> her&ndash;&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Sorry about that again,&rdquo;</i></p><p>She glared at him for interrupting her, &ldquo;<i><b>And you touched me as if you didn&rsquo;t just touch her minutes before! I mean </b>god<b> did you even wash your hands?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>He only shook his head at her question. </p><p><b><i>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s disgusting, Harry!&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;I said I was sorry! Why can&rsquo;t you accept that already?&rdquo;</i></p><p>She spotted the soiled couch, the cushions pressed in from the weight of Harry and Luna&rsquo;s bodies, the blanket was half on the couch and a half on the floor. </p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Not only did you take your sweet time getting to the door, but you also forgot about me these past few weeks and you know it,&rdquo; </i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;I canceled one thing and you&rsquo;re acting as if I ruined this friendship,&rdquo;</i></p><p>She stared at him incredulously, &ldquo;<b><i>One? It was three, Harry! You kept saying &lsquo;maybe next time&rsquo; but it never comes,&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t just drop everything for you,&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;But you used to&rdquo; </b></i></p><p>He ran a hand over his face, the stress of the conversation weighing in on him. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Luna, sh-she&rsquo;s more important now,&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that supposed to mean?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m saying that I want to focus on her and me,&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re basically kicking me to the side? Because you found someone else to give you something that you can&rsquo;t accept from me?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m doing, Y/N,&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;<b><i>Then explain to me! Please, I&rsquo;m trying to understand you,&rdquo;</i></b> She begged him and Y/N&rsquo;s sure that Luna had probably heard their conversation by now. It didn&rsquo;t take that long to prepare the snacks.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I really want her and I to work,&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;<b><i>I wish you the best too, you know that. I&rsquo;m just confused as to where I stand,</i></b>&rdquo; Y/N stated. &ldquo;<i><b>I don&rsquo;t want to make you choose, Har, but I need to know if you see me as a convenient person that will always catch you when you fall or if you really care about me because right now, it seems like you don't&rsquo;&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I care about you and I love you, Y/N&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t answer my question, Styles,</b></i>&rdquo; Her eyes were stinging from the tears she was holding back. She wasn&rsquo;t going to give him the satisfaction of crying in front of him. &ldquo;<i><b>Are you keeping me around because you know I&rsquo;ll stay?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>&ldquo;<b><i>Please don&rsquo;t take advantage of me like that.&rdquo;</i></b> She pleaded, a lone tear slipping down her cheek and he instinctively reached out to wipe it away; like he used to.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I-i&rsquo;m not,&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Prove it,&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;But Y/N, you said you wouldn&rsquo;t make me chose</i>,&rdquo; His reply was an answer in itself, his actions and words were already hinting at possible disclosure between him and her, but hearing it from him made it more real. He already knew that he was going to choose Luna, but he kept Y/N around for the sake of his selfish reasons. </p><p><b><i>&ldquo;You choose her, huh?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>He tried to come closer to her, but every time he took a step forward, her body backed away from him. </p><p><i>&ldquo;I-i don&rsquo;t know what to say,&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;<b><i>I don&rsquo;t know either, H&rdquo;</i></b> She puffed her chest out, heart aching deeply at his words. </p><p><i>&ldquo;I really like her, Y/N&rdquo;</i></p><p>The knife in her chest twisted, breaking the pieces into sharper shards that scratch her insides, capturing her in an endless loop of pain. Everything she hoped to be, everything she desired to herself was given to somebody else and it<i>&nbsp;wasn&rsquo;t fair</i>. It wasn&rsquo;t fair that she is treated so poorly right now by a man she loves and it wasn&rsquo;t even his fault! He&rsquo;s right, you can&rsquo;t control your feelings because Y/N still loves him the way she did before.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>&mdash;</p><p>It hurts. There was a hole in her chest, an abyss swallowing every emotion she felt except anger, pain, grief, loneliness, and disappointment. Those stuck around, circling her heart and making her feel bad about herself but she couldn&rsquo;t find anything to counteract the sorrow she was feeling. It mocked her like Harry had used her. She didn&rsquo;t realize it at first because it was subtle and fundamental that when she did, &nbsp;it was too late to try and revive the old Y/N. She died right along when Harry chose someone else over her. </p><p>Her body ached, limbs and joints remaining in the same position for a continuous amount of time. Y/N&rsquo;s throat was dry, having not spoken for days&ndash;having not left her place for days&ndash; and she felt like every time a word scraped by that she would break into a heaving sob, burning her lungs for air as snot filled her nostrils. She turned off her phone to disconnect herself from the outside world, surely nothing important would happen to a nobody like her; a thought that Harry further revealed as true by stepping on her and beating down on her love and trust. She refused to see herself in any reflection because she knew that she would only be met with a lifeless counterpart, a stranger staring at her because even she didn&rsquo;t know <i>who she was anymore.</i> It hurts when every time she closed her eyes, an image of Harry and Luna embedded itself permanently in her brain that she often had to spend nights staring at the ceiling, afraid to sleep. </p><p>Y/N didn&rsquo;t know if he was okay, he probably was, since she hasn&rsquo;t heard from anyone in days. Sometimes he would sneak into her dreams and give her a few moments to imagine a life where they were together; her dreams were a place for them to be together whereas reality only spits at her pathetic attempt of finding love. He used her for his own selfish reasons and she let him because she desired him too much. He only kept her around because she was a safety net in case anything goes wrong and she couldn&rsquo;t even let herself be too angry at him because <i>at least</i> he made her feel wanted. At least he trusted her with <i>him</i> himself; but he could never trust her with his heart even though she gave her own to Harry, willingly. </p><hr /><p>&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>let me know what you thought!</p><p>taglist; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrOnqAm3S2YJtqPJmZcO4hA\">@besitostyles</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQsX6KLms40JeRDlVk6NEWQ\">@fangirl-moment-x</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmxi3QUpqS4qTJLeJ8fcoTg\">@harrysahottie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPsz_HJ-fGqnDHAg-f46rlw\">@rosepetalumbrella</a> @evalynanne <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1fpivr--tbthEpoz43VhvA\">@ynm1505</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mh1UB6m8cO8XVhlwnfb9nIw\">@cuddlebughazza</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRQvNGuL791trMASjjacTyQ\">@pxrrishly</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgQ5EdNPkpDmT4rcK7Heukg\">@lovableah</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5YrYTiKDl0TdQIXZojMV_A\">@always-alone19</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwsID5ppi1FgvnAzeQekAZw\">@projkiwidicine</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNYxAvIQgRI_STqjv_SuZBQ\">@harrystxleslx</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0cXlYozjbqnAyl8Z2SwQEg\">@harryspirate</a> @mutuallynotmutual <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3S2pR3NTVs5Hor-c5rdmsA\">@ftinxmirx</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtsSGFroaE9zkOMCKMZWCww\">@xalittlebitofeverythingx</a></p>",

Just lay in bed and enjoy the warmth of the sun until one of you had to go to the bathroom. You were laying on your back while he was at your stomach just looking at you. You had your hand in his hair, combing through the grown out length. It was not the mane you were used to and loved before he decided to chop it all off. But, it was a start and you could deal with it. Looking down to see him, his eyes were heavy from your actions but he insisted to look at you with soft green eyes.
