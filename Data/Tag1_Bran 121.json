        "body": "<p><b><br/></b>This week, I tweeted a \u2018Bold prediction\u2019 that tbh wasn\u2019t much of a bold prediction. The basic premise was the Starks come out on top. The tweet read like this:<br/><i>Bold prediction that I will at some point write a tumblr meta about. Bran gets the NK, Arya kills Daenerys, Sansa takes out Tyrion, and Jon valonqars the sh*t out of Cersei. Just like that all their enemies are gone. #Starks4theWin #Starklings</i><br/></p><p><b>Bran v\u2019s Night King</b></p><p>This is the point I am the least sure about. But in the end, I do think Bran will play a pivotal role in taking out the Night King and the White Walkers. Jon will come in with the huge assist along with Arya. I fully expect them to have some big kills.</p><p><b>Arya v\u2019s Daenerys</b></p><p>A few other people in the fandom have mentioned this or talked about it. Arya has long been about killing Cersei, the Queen. Except for last season when Lannister soldiers asked her where she was going she said \u2018To kill the Queen.\u2019 A great twist to this would be that she eventually kills or plays a huge role in taking out Daenerys. She may come to a place where her skills are better used to protect her family. <br/>I could also see Daenerys being substituted in for Drogon in this case. I would love an Eowyn like moment where Arya takes off whatever face she is wearing and slays the beast. The show even gave us misdirects with the recent Arya staring in awe at dragons footage.\u00a0</p><p><b>Sansa v\u2019s Tyrion</b></p><p>This is the point I am most confident about. Sansa really needs to get Tyrion out of the way if she wants to live her life. The show made a bit of a mess of this. However, in the books, she is still very much married to Tyrion. She very much didn\u2019t want to be married to him and still doesn\u2019t. A higher authority could give her an annulment. Except for Jon just made the lovely decision to pledge to Daenerys. And Daenerys would have no interest in annulling a marriage between Tyrion and Sansa. What would better tie the North and the Westerlands to her cause then maintaining this marriage. See when Jon gave up his crown (sorta&hellip;he never actually got down on his knee\u2026) he gave up his authority in the North outside of commanding the armies. Sansa has the real power in Winterfell, now. The check on that. The check on Northern independence is Tyrion re-asserting their marriage. So yea Sansa really has to get out of it. This whole scenario may not play out in the show, we may get hints of it instead. Since the show has to end the same as the books, Sansa still has to take out Tyrion, the reasoning just might shift a bit.</p><p>**Also, I fully believe Tyrion is the real \u2018giant\u2019 Sansa slays in the castle made of snow. Again in the show, she may do it somewhere else. Tyrion is the only character referred to as a giant among men etc. etc. Littlefinger is a red herring for this prophecy imo.</p><p><b>Jon v\u2019s Cersei</b></p><p>As I said in my tweet, I believe Jon will valonqar the shit out of Cersei. I\u2019ve written about this is <a href=\"https://castaliareed.tumblr.com/post/182427278385/could-jon-really-marry-cersei-in-season-8\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://castaliareed.tumblr.com/post/169096688840/the-younger-more-beautiful-queen-the-valonqar\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://castaliareed.tumblr.com/post/174930749380/tinfoil-and-crack-whos-the-valonqar\">here</a>. The basic argument goes a bit like this, the use of the term hints at someone with valyrian ancestry. Or someone who would become known by that term which means people might attribute valyrian ancestry to them. The term also means little sibling or brother. This makes it an ideal term to refer to Jon after the parent reveal because he is the younger of Rhaegar\u2019s children. He is the younger Aegon. The added bonus is he is the younger King in the North, too. This makes more sense in the books where (f)Aegon, Rhaegar\u2019s older son and the older Aegon because Jon will be named Aegon in the books, plays a big role. I mean seriously guys can\u2019t you just see it&hellip;Jon will become know as Aegon the Valonqar.</p><p>Another point in this theories favor is that Jon is the only character we see get in close and lose his sh*t on people. He punched Ramsey repeatedly and uncontrollably. He choked out Littlefinger. In the books, he is constantly clutching and unclutching his sword hand to the point that it is a nervous habit. He\u2019s just waiting to wrap his hands around someone\u2019s neck.</p><p>And what sets him off like this? People who have harmed or mention Sansa. It\u2019s pretty safe to say that Sansa is on the very short list of two of being the younger more beautiful queen. If Cersei threatens her in any way&hellip;well&hellip;Jon is very likely to lose his mind. This is becoming even more likely because there are serious rumors out there that Cersei kidnaps Sansa. Yes, this theory relates to Jonsa and a possible Jonsa ending but it is not limited to that.\u00a0</p><p>Generally, the \u2018pack\u2019 kills together. They will all help each other take out the various other parties. We\u2019ve already seen this with Jon and Sansa in the BoTB and later when Sansa, Arya, and Bran execute Littlefinger. \u00a0But each Starkling takes the lead on one of these end game deaths. There are other noteworthy deaths that our Starks may have a hand in (The Mountain, Euron, etc). But the ones mentioned here are the big ones. The Starks are the center of this story. They are our erstwhile heroes. This story is about them coming into their own. About them perhaps starting a new dynasty. To do that they are going to have to take a few people out first.</p>",

I fully expect them to have some big kills.</p><p><b>Arya v\u2019s Daenerys</b></p><p>A few other people in the fandom have mentioned this or talked about it. Arya has long been about killing Cersei, the Queen. Except for last season when Lannister soldiers asked her where she was going she said \u2018To kill the Queen.\u2019 A great twist to this would be that she eventually kills or plays a huge role in taking out Daenerys. She may come to a place where her skills are better used to protect her family. <br>I could also see Daenerys being substituted in for Drogon in this case. I would love an Eowyn like moment where Arya takes off whatever face she is wearing and slays the beast. The show even gave us misdirects with the recent Arya staring in awe at dragons footage.\u00a0</p><p><b>Sansa v\u2019s Tyrion</b></p><p>This is the point I am most confident about. Sansa really needs to get Tyrion out of the way if she wants to live her life. The show made a bit of a mess of this. However, in the books, she is still very much married to Tyrion. She very much didn\u2019t want to be married to him and still doesn\u2019t. A higher authority could give her an annulment. Except for Jon just made the lovely decision to pledge to Daenerys. And Daenerys would have no interest in annulling a marriage between Tyrion and Sansa. What would better tie the North and the Westerlands to her cause then maintaining this marriage. See when Jon gave up his crown (sorta\u2026he never actually got down on his knee\u2026) he gave up his authority in the North outside of commanding the armies. Sansa has the real power in Winterfell, now. The check on that. The check on Northern independence is Tyrion re-asserting their marriage. So yea Sansa really has to get out of it. This whole scenario may not play out in the show, we may get hints of it instead. Since the show has to end the same as the books, Sansa still has to take out Tyrion, the reasoning just might shift a bit.</p><p>**Also, I fully believe Tyrion is the real \u2018giant\u2019 Sansa slays in the castle made of snow. Again in the show, she may do it somewhere else. Tyrion is the only character referred to as a giant among men etc. etc. Littlefinger is a red herring for this prophecy imo.</p><p><b>Jon v\u2019s Cersei</b></p><p>As I said in my tweet, I believe Jon will valonqar the shit out of Cersei. I\u2019ve written about this is <a href=\"https://castaliareed.tumblr.com/post/182427278385/could-jon-really-marry-cersei-in-season-8\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://castaliareed.tumblr.com/post/169096688840/the-younger-more-beautiful-queen-the-valonqar\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://castaliareed.tumblr.com/post/174930749380/tinfoil-and-crack-whos-the-valonqar\">here</a>. The basic argument goes a bit like this, the use of the term hints at someone with valyrian ancestry. Or someone who would become known by that term which means people might attribute valyrian ancestry to them. The term also means little sibling or brother. This makes it an ideal term to refer to Jon after the parent reveal because he is the younger of Rhaegar\u2019s children. He is the younger Aegon. The added bonus is he is the younger King in the North, too. This makes more sense in the books where (f)Aegon, Rhaegar\u2019s older son and the older Aegon because Jon will be named Aegon in the books, plays a big role. I mean seriously guys can\u2019t you just see it\u2026Jon will become know as Aegon the Valonqar.</p><p>Another point in this theories favor is that Jon is the only character we see get in close and lose his sh*t on people. He punched Ramsey repeatedly and uncontrollably. He choked out Littlefinger. In the books, he is constantly clutching and unclutching his sword hand to the point that it is a nervous habit. He\u2019s just waiting to wrap his hands around someone\u2019s neck.</p><p>And what sets him off like this? People who have harmed or mention Sansa. It\u2019s pretty safe to say that Sansa is on the very short list of two of being the younger more beautiful queen. If Cersei threatens her in any way\u2026well\u2026Jon is very likely to lose his mind. This is becoming even more likely because there are serious rumors out there that Cersei kidnaps Sansa. Yes, this theory relates to Jonsa and a possible Jonsa ending but it is not limited to that.\u00a0</p><p>Generally, the \u2018pack\u2019 kills together. They will all help each other take out the various other parties. We\u2019ve already seen this with Jon and Sansa in the BoTB and later when Sansa, Arya, and Bran execute Littlefinger. \u00a0But each Starkling takes the lead on one of these end game deaths. There are other noteworthy deaths that our Starks may have a hand in (The Mountain, Euron, etc). But the ones mentioned here are the big ones. The Starks are the center of this story. They are our erstwhile heroes. This story is about them coming into their own. About them perhaps starting a new dynasty. To do that they are going to have to take a few people out first.</p>",

The Others aren\u2019t pure evil &amp; actually have a reason for rallying and coming South. They are the heroes of their story just as they appear to be the villains to us.\u00a0</p><p>2. The Starks have a long history with the Others and the Night\u2019s Watch. Somehow their story is tied up in the Night\u2019s King, the first Lord Commanders, The Kings of Winter, and the Kings Beyond the Wall. Their words\u00a0\u201cWinter is Coming\u201d are derived from this connection, and may not just be a warning of hard times but also a brag of their own such as\u00a0\u201cHear Me Roar\u201d or\u00a0\u201cGrowing Strong\u201d\u00a0</p><p>3. Therefore, the Starks have a large role to play in the conflict with the Others, and that conflict will likely result in diplomacy.\u00a0</p><p>4. The ultimate resolution will be about restoring balance to the world. Right now, there are extremely long winters and extremely long summers. The seasons are out of whack, and there is some kind of ancient magical reason for this.\u00a0</p><p>5. Dany is Azor Ahai, and ultimately she will become dark!dany or more of a villain character.\u00a0</p><p>6. The ice and fire threats are the Others and the dragons/those of dragonblood. But there is also the R\u2019hollo to consider as well as some type of ancient ice god/force.\u00a0</p><p>7. Jon is the song of ice and fire, and as such he will likely play a large role in negotiations with the Others and potentially Dany.\u00a0</p><p>8. The wall may have first been built by the children of the forest or the others and not men as it is told in stories. (Generally the legends may be exaggerated and untrue). The Night\u2019s Watch may have been originally an allied Others and First Men group under the Night\u2019s King (human and a Stark probably) and his queen (other).\u00a0</p><p>9. The Others reasons for rising and attacking may be that some form of the alliance or agreement was broken. It could be the return of Daenerys and dragon/magic, the widespread religion of R\u2019hollo, Summerhall, Aegon\u2019s conquest, or the long night\u2019s return, etc. etc.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>This post and its collective comments were written 4 years ago, so we have much more of the show to add to these original theories. Of course, D&amp;D may have strayed from what GRRM will do, but they know the ultimate ending. It\u2019s safe to assume we are headed toward the general right path.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>There\u2019s speculation that Jon as the balance between ice and fire will become the King at the Wall and take an Other as a bride. Some believe that Val from the books could be this bride or that Ygritte could be raised from the dead to become the bride.

Again, though, this wouldn\u2019t bring a sense of balance in my opinion.\u00a0I don\u2019t see Dany making it out of season 8 alive, and if she does, I see it as some sort of alliance like this one.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>Perhaps there could also be an ending where Dany is defeated after she probably backs out on the deal with Jon and goes to take down Cersei. I imagine she would burn the Red Keep to the ground and at some point the Iron Throne itself would melt. (Although I always liked the idea of Sansa or Jaime ultimately taking Cersei down&hellip;) A deal is made with the Others, and they retreat. A Stark rules in Winterfell as King in the North/The King of Winter, and perhaps the Night\u2019s Watch is abandoned or changed entirely. If it was part of the old treaty, it obviously ended up backfiring. (Also, in this scenario perhaps Sansa and Jon can be together because tbh that\u2019s what I truly want).

He will have died/sacrificed himself because he\u2019s the only one who could do it or something like that. Similarly, if Sansa were to die or be married off to an Other or something similar, I feel it would be her duty and in some way so befitting of a queen to sacrifice for her people. Arya on the other hand, her death would have less plot meaning. I think in general her arc has the least amount of plot meaning and endgame potential, so I worry she will die in battle. I\u2019m sure it would be a lovely scene, but it wouldn\u2019t probably have lasting impacts the same way Jon or Sansa\u2019s (or also Dany\u2019s) would. Bran I don\u2019t think will die because he is the Three-Eyed Raven UNLESS it is important that the Three-Eyed Raven die in order to defeat the Night King/come to an agreement/etc. We still don\u2019t know the full extent of his powers or his purpose yet, so a lot is up in the air for Bran. We just know he\u2019s important.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>I want to add quickly that Melisandre said she has to die in this strange country. I wonder if perhaps there is some of agreement/coupling or something that she as a Red Priestess will be involved in. She obviously still has a part to play, and seeing as I imagine that the second she arrives she\u2019ll be marked for death, she will likely show up at a very pivotal moment. I don\u2019t imagine her just popping in to give Jon some advice at a vision in the flames. It will be more than that and likely it will be magical.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>The teaser of the map where ice and fire meet and almost form some kind of wall or mountain&hellip; it has always made me think that perhaps a new wall is formed at the end of this to replace the current wall?\u00a0</p>",

Again, though, this wouldn\u2019t bring a sense of balance in my opinion.\u00a0I don\u2019t see Dany making it out of season 8 alive, and if she does, I see it as some sort of alliance like this one.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps there could also be an ending where Dany is defeated after she probably backs out on the deal with Jon and goes to take down Cersei. I imagine she would burn the Red Keep to the ground and at some point the Iron Throne itself would melt. (Although I always liked the idea of Sansa or Jaime ultimately taking Cersei down\u2026) A deal is made with the Others, and they retreat. A Stark rules in Winterfell as King in the North/The King of Winter, and perhaps the Night\u2019s Watch is abandoned or changed entirely. If it was part of the old treaty, it obviously ended up backfiring. (Also, in this scenario perhaps Sansa and Jon can be together because tbh that\u2019s what I truly want). Maybe there is independence and Westeros becomes Seven Kingdoms who work together again, and this may be led by Tyrion who is a great politician but not a true leader or King of all Seven realms.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>I think that Arya\u2019s fate is the only Stark I am truly worried about\u2026 if Jon dies, I know it will be at the pinnacle hero moment which will ultimately make it worth it. He will have died/sacrificed himself because he\u2019s the only one who could do it or something like that. Similarly, if Sansa were to die or be married off to an Other or something similar, I feel it would be her duty and in some way so befitting of a queen to sacrifice for her people. Arya on the other hand, her death would have less plot meaning. I think in general her arc has the least amount of plot meaning and endgame potential, so I worry she will die in battle. I\u2019m sure it would be a lovely scene, but it wouldn\u2019t probably have lasting impacts the same way Jon or Sansa\u2019s (or also Dany\u2019s) would. Bran I don\u2019t think will die because he is the Three-Eyed Raven UNLESS it is important that the Three-Eyed Raven die in order to defeat the Night King/come to an agreement/etc. We still don\u2019t know the full extent of his powers or his purpose yet, so a lot is up in the air for Bran. We just know he\u2019s important.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>I want to add quickly that Melisandre said she has to die in this strange country. I wonder if perhaps there is some of agreement/coupling or something that she as a Red Priestess will be involved in. She obviously still has a part to play, and seeing as I imagine that the second she arrives she\u2019ll be marked for death, she will likely show up at a very pivotal moment. I don\u2019t imagine her just popping in to give Jon some advice at a vision in the flames. It will be more than that and likely it will be magical.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>The teaser of the map where ice and fire meet and almost form some kind of wall or mountain\u2026 it has always made me think that perhaps a new wall is formed at the end of this to replace the current wall?\u00a0</p>",
