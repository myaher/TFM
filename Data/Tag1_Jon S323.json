        "body": "<p>I\u2019ve had some time to write and finished another chapter. I sincerely hope to have this fic finished soon! As someone said in the comments to my fic. The excrement is about to hit the airing device. Jon Snow wakes up to find an enraged Da\u20acnerys at his bedside. Also on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/8470255/chapters/36291405\">AO3</a>.</p><p>Jon only\ngrabbed occasional bouts of sleep during the night, and when he slept his\ndreams were disturbed by strange feelings. He felt the loss of a brother that\nhad just died and anger at the human who had ordered him to fly high. He knew\nhe had escaped the dreadful sound of the horn, but he had also wanted to\neliminate the man who had dared to try to conquer him. When he felt his brother\ndie, he had wanted to revenge his brother, although he had no clear idea who\nhad killed him. Was it the man who had blown the horn? Was it one of the other\nant-like wraiths he had seen from far above? He didn\u2019t know. <br/></p><!-- more --><p>When Jon\nhad been awake in between his dreams he had felt cold sweat on his brow. Awake\nhe knew that he had somehow shared the thoughts of the green dragon, Rhaegal.\nIt had felt strange, exhausting, alien, not like the bond he shared with Ghost.\nThe dragon was flame and hunger, his thoughts about the humans around him laced\nwith contempt. Jon felt much more comfortable in Ghost. He knew that\ncontrolling the dragon would never be easy, if he even wanted to take that\npath.</p><p>When he lay\nawake he wondered what the woman sleeping beside him would make of his\nconnection to the dragon. He had never told anybody about Ghost. Should he tell\nher? She hadn\u2019t wondered why Rhaegal had flown as high as Drogon. Was she\nconnected to the black dragon like he was to the green? Jon didn\u2019t know what to\nmake of it. His thoughts wandered to Ghost, to Winterfell and to Sansa. It had\nbeen pleasant enough to have Daenerys in his arms. She had a natural joy in sex\nthat was endearing, but he knew that he would never love her. His body had\nreacted readily, but his thoughts had been detached, and his soul had felt no\nconnection. Daenerys had gone to sleep almost immediately while Jon had twisted\nand turned. His thoughts, when not circling around the dragon, were drawn to\nSansa and the fevered words she had spoken to Ghost when he had dreamed of the\nweirwood north of the Wall. <i>There is\nnothing we can do about it. I love her, but I cannot have her. She\u2019ll marry\nSweetrobin or Littlefinger to forge an alliance that helps the North. </i>He\nfervently hoped that Lord Royce had it wrong. The thought of Littlefinger as\nSansa\u2019s husband made Jon\u2019s stomach burn in hatred. He flexed his fingers,\nimagining driving Longclaw through Littlefinger\u2019s throat. Sweetrobin was\nbetter. As far as Jon knew he was not yet a man and it should be possible to\npostpone a wedding. <i>To what purpose\nthough? You cannot have her. </i>Jon sighed and looked at the woman beside him.\nDaenerys\u2019 face looked peaceful in sleep. <i>I\nmight as well try to get along with my new ally. We\u2019ll be stuck here at\nSaltpans until a ship comes anyway.</i></p><p>When his\nrestless thoughts finally came to a halt and blessed dreamless sleep took him, it\nmust have been already in the early hours of the day, because when he woke up,\nthe sun was high up in the sky. His tongue felt dry and strange in his mouth.\nHe suspected that the air was still affected by the fire that had burned\nyesterday. He was laying alone in the bed, his face to the windows. When he\nconcentrated he could feel air swirling around him and sunshine on wings and a\ndistant feeling of hunger that would soon become stronger. He shook himself, sat\nup and turned. </p><p>Daenerys\nwas sitting on a chair beside his bed, her face a strange and distant mask, her\ngaze cool and queenly. Jon shrank back. <i>I\nthought we had come to an understanding? </i>In her hands, there were two\nscrolls, and Jon\u2019s heart began to pound wildly, when he realised that she held\nthe letters from Winterfell, he had carried in his tunic all the way from\nDragonstone, to the wall and back.</p><p>\u201cJon Snow, you\nare finally awake.\u201d Daenerys said. Her voice sounded pressed, as if she\ncontained her anger. \u201cYou claim to be a King\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy people\nchose me as their King\u201d Jon answered warily. He did not know what to make of\nher obvious anger. He felt at a disadvantage being still naked while she was in\nregal attire. </p><p>\u201cDo they\nknow you just do the bidding of your sisters?\u201d she asked. </p><p>\u201cWhy would\nyou say that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYour\nsisters told you to seduce me.\u201d Daenerys opened the letters.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jon\nwas taken aback. </p><p>\u201c<i>Please remember your courtesies when you\nspeak with the Queen. I hear she is young and beautiful and she might be\nsympathetic to a very handsome king known for his skills with a sword</i>.\u201d\nDaenerys quoted from Sansa\u2019s letter. \u201c<i>If\nthe dragon queen makes trouble, just stick her with the pointy end.\u2019</i>\u201d That\nwas from the short paragraph Arya had written.</p><p>For a\nmoment, Jon was at a loss for words. </p><p>\u201cThis is\nnot what you think\u201d he finally said. \u201cNeither of them was talking about\nseducing you. Sansa just wanted me to mind my courtesies and Arya\u2026. \u201c Jon tried\nto think of something to say and licked his lips. \u201c\u2026. It\u2019s a joke we used to\nmake. Pointy end is just the end of her sword.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys\nscowled. \u201cAre you telling me your sister told you to kill me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course\nnot,\u201d Jon leapt to Arya\u2019s defence. \u201cIt is a joke. A joke. And if you hadn\u2019t\nread letters not meant for you, you would not be in the situation to\nmisunderstand.\u201d He was getting angry himself now. <i>She read Sansa\u2019s letters to me! </i></p><p>He stood\nup, not caring for his nudity and snatched the letters from Daenerys\u2019 hands. </p><p>\u201cBe\ncareful, King Snow,\u201d Daenerys said. Her gaze pierced him. He could see that she\ndid not believe him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t\nhave that many men at your disposal right now. I could have you arrested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI helped\nsave your men.\u201d Jon protested.</p><p>Daenerys\nbarked a laugh. \u201cTell me, how did you save anybody? You killed Euron, but he\nwas already down. And your woman Brienne killed my dragon! Greyworm told me\nabout it. You held that back yesterday!\u201d</p><p>For a brief\nmoment, Jon was tempted to tell her about his connection to Rhaegal, that had\nat least in part saved the situation, but he bit his tongue. This was not the\nright time to confide to the enraged queen.</p><p>He took a\ndeep breath and willed his own anger away. There was no use in a shouting\nmatch. With as much dignity as he could muster he threw over his tunic and\nstepped in his trousers. Then he turned to the queen and tried to talk calm and\ncollected.</p><p>\u201cBrienne\nkilled the dragon who was under the thrall of the horn. I cleared the docks, so\nthat the dragons in their grief would not hurt more people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then\nyou didn\u2019t tell me who killed the dragon. And in the night, you acted at your\nsisters\u2019 advice. Where is Brienne now? I might be inclined to overlook your\nimpudence, if you tell me where she is. And the kingslayer. He might have\nhelped her.\u201d Daenerys made no effort to keep her voice low.</p><p>Jon willed\nhimself to calm. \u201cYour Grace, I ordered Brienne to leave and make for Winterfell.\nI don\u2019t know where she is.\u201d <i>Nor would I\ntell you, if I knew it, not in your current state of mind.</i></p><p>\u201cAs for the\nnight,\u201d he gave a short bow. \u201cI plead with you to believe me, that there was no\nill intent on my side. We need you and your dragons to fight against the White\nWalkers. You saw for yourself how dangerous the situation is. You saw the wight\nwe brought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need\nme? Or you need my dragons?\u201d, Daenerys\u2019 voice was not as loud as before, but\nthat did not reassure Jon. Her eyes glittered.</p><p>\u201cYour\ngrace, we all need your dragons. When I was north of the Wall, Thoros of Myr\ntold me that the wall is growing weaker. The seven kingdoms will face an\ninvasion of the White Walkers and the Undead\u201d, he tried to explain. \u201cYou told\nme that you would fight with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you\nthat I would fight with you, before one of my dragons was killed, before the\ntruce with the Lannisters was shattered, before you lied to me about the person\nwho killed my child.\u201d She took a breath.</p><p>\u201cIf I go\nNorth with you, Cersei will retake the entire South.\u201d She added.</p><p>\u201cIf you\ndon\u2019t go North, it won\u2019t matter who holds the South,\u201d Jon argued. \u201cThe White\nWalkers will conquer the North and then they will come for you. Do you think\nthe Neck will stop them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want\nme to turn my back on the South and fight with you? And afterwards? Your sister\nholds the Vale and the Riverlands. You the North, Cersei will hold the South.\nWhat will be left for me?\u201d Daenerys demanded.</p><p>\u201cMy sister\nwill hold the Vale?\u201d Jon asked. <i>How would\nshe know?</i></p><p>\u201cMy hand\nhas his methods to get information.\u201d Daenerys said haughtily.</p><p><i>Which letter? Did Tyrion see Lord Royce\u2019s\nletter or Arya\u2019s ramblings? Probably not Arya\u2019s letter or she wouldn\u2019t suspect\nArya to have advised me to seduce her.</i></p><p>\u201cYour\ngrace,\u201d Jon willed her to listen. \u201cI secured you the proof you needed. It is\nnot my fault that Cersei got wind of our parley. It is not my fault that Euron\ntried to steal your dragons. It\u2019s not my fault one of your dragons had to be\nkilled to save people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should\njust have destroyed the horn.\u201d Daenerys interrupted him. \u201cViserion could have\nshook of the bonds then.\u201d</p><p>Jon looked\nat her, his own anger was slowly getting hold of him. <i>Did she not see the danger?</i></p><p>\u201cYour\ngrace, I admit that this would have been better, but Euron\u2019s pirates were\nthrowing what we thought was wildfire. We are all lucky to have escaped alive.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes\nglittered again, and Jon realised that she was fighting tears, if they were\ntears of anger, grief or hurt, he could not have said.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\nyour grace. You are angry and distressed. We should not continue our talk,\nbefore we are both calmer. I beg you to reconsider everything I\u2019ve done. I gave\nyou my word, we had an understanding.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys\nopened her mouth, and Jon could see that she was about to lash out again, but they\nwere interrupted by a knock on the door. Davos entered immediately after\nknocking.</p><p>Jon was\nglad that he had dressed. He could see two Unsullied at the door, but they were\noutnumbered by a dozen men who wore the uniforms of the City Watch of King\u2019s\nLanding.</p><p>\u201cYour\ngrace.\u201d Davos bowed. \u201cI finally managed to get rooms fit for a king. I am sure,\nafter you and Queen Daenerys have discussed politics the whole morning, you\nneed rest.\u201d </p><p>Davos\u2019 eyes\nwere pleading with him. He even went as far as extending a hand. Daenerys\nlooked from him to the two Unsullied and Jon could see her calculating if she\nshould give the order to seize them. The Unsullied were good fighters, but the\ncity watch outnumbered them. She let her hands fall to her side.</p><p>Jon nodded.\nHe put the letters he still held in his tunic and snatched at Longclaw.</p><p>He bowed\ndeeply to Daenerys. \u201cYour grace, I hope we can continue this talk another\ntime.\u201d Whatever good luck had brought Davos to him, he would not risk being\ndetained by an enraged queen.</p><p>Daenerys\ngave him a nod that was halfway between gracious and haughty. </p><p>\u201cWe will\ncontinue our talk. Circumstances have changed, and I think we must renegotiate.\nIf you want my army and my dragons you will pay the price I name. I shall\nponder what that might be.\u201d </p><p>That was\nnot what Jon had hoped when he had entered her room yesterday. <i>How did it all go wrong? Why did she have to\nread my letters? Why did that damned Lannister look at the letters I was sent?</i></p><p>They left\nthe house in the midst of reassuring regular beating strides of the soldiers\nDavos had brought. </p><p>\u201cDo you\ntrust them?\u201d Jon whispered, gesturing at the guards. </p><p>\u201cThese are\nGendry\u2019s men. They work against Queen Cersei.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did\nyou come looking for me?\u201d he asked his Hand.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to\nensure your safety.\u201d Davos answered. </p><p>\u201cYou did\nwell, but how did you know that things went awry? Not, that I complain.\u201d </p><p>Davos\nlooked at him with concern in his eyes. </p><p>\u201cDid Queen Daenerys\nfind out? Was that, why she was shouting? I\u2019m sure you could have preferred to\nfind out in another way.\u201d He laid a hand on his arm.</p><p>Jon was\nconfused. \u201cFind out what? Daenerys was angry that Brienne killed her dragon\u201d.\nHe shook his head still wondering how Daenerys had not realised how dangerous the\nsituation with the dragons had been. \u201cand\u2026.\u201d He could feel the blood creeping\nin his cheeks. \u201cShe read my sisters\u2019 letters. She misunderstood them. She\nthought, Sansa had ordered me to seduce her. Tyrion must have told her about\nthe planned alliance with the Vale.\u201d</p><p>Davos nodded.\n\u201cUnfortunately, there are ways to open a letter and leave the seal undamaged.\nIt is unfortunate, that Lord Tyrion found out about the planned alliance with\nthe Vale.\u201d</p><p>They were\nrounding a corner and approached a house at the docks, that Davos must have had\nchosen because it was close to the water. They could defend it with only a few\nmen.</p><p>\u201cBut I was\ntalking about something else. It does not bode well, that you fell out with the\nqueen. You are in great danger, but we might keep things quiet and secret for\nnow.\u201d Davos said. Jon was at a loss what he meant.</p><p>When they\nentered the house, Davos ordered the men to secure the house from all corners.\nHis face was worried. Jon was worried as well. <i>What will Daenerys demand? Our whole trip North of the wall was for\nnothing. We don\u2019t get the Lannister army, I\u2019m stuck here, with only two dozen\nmen, most of them not my own, and Daenerys will make demands for an alliance,\njust because she thinks I\u2019m backed in a corner and her war does no go as she\nwants.</i></p><p>Davos led\nJon up the stairs. \u201cThere is someone you have to see.\u201d </p><p>When Jon\nentered the small room on top of the stairs, he felt a rush of real joy. </p><p>\u201cSam\u201d, he\ncried out and ran to hug his friend. </p><p>Sam hugged\nhim back, but soon stepped back. </p><p>\u201cHow are\nyou, why are you here? Where is Gilly?\u201d Jon asked.</p><p>Sam didn\u2019t\nanswer anything, but looked at him with sad and earnest eyes. </p><p>\u201cJon, you\nhave to leave here as fast as possible. You are in great danger.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t\nbe the first time,\u201d Jon joked. \u201cWhat is it this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\nthink you are safe anywhere near Daenerys Targaryen.\u201d Sam answered.</p><p>He shoved\nhis hair out of his face. Jon realised that he looked travel-worn and that he\nhad lost weight. </p><p>\u201cI came as\nfast as I could. You are in danger, because you are a threat to her claim.\u201d Sam\ncombed his hair nervously with his fingers. \n\u201cI don\u2019t really know, how to tell you this\u2026.\u201d </p><p>Sam somehow\nurged him to take a seat. Jon was puzzled. He had never seen his friend that\nfussing about. He obliged him and sat down. Sam sat beside him and looked at\nthe floor.</p><p>He made\nseveral attempts to start until he finally burst out: \u201cI was assigned to bring\norder to a letter collection from the mad king\u2019s reign. Tedious work, nobody\nhad ever looked at it, over 1000 letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was\na letter by Arthur Dayne, the kingsguard, to his sister Ashara. It was written\nafter Rhaegar had fallen at the Trident and the Mad King had been murdered. He\nasked his sister if she would be willing to raise a child to save it from\nRobert\u2019s wrath. He wanted her to claim it was her son, hers and Brandon Starks,\nwhen it was Rhaegar\u2019s son.\u201d</p><p>Jon\nfrowned. \u201cAegon, Rhaegar\u2019s son, was killed by the mountain in the sack of\nKing\u2019s Landing, everybody knows that.\u201d </p><p>Sam shook\nhis head \u201cNot that son. Rhaegar\u2019s and Lyanna\u2019s son.\u201d</p><p>Jon\nsuddenly felt dizzy.</p><p>\u201cWhat do\nyou want to say?\u201d But he didn\u2019t really need to be told. Somehow, he knew.</p><p>\u201cLyanna had\na son. Arthur Dayne wanted to save the son of his prince. A son, he considered\nlegitimate, because Rhaegar had taken Lyanna as a second wife, like the\nTargaryens of old. The High Septon himself sanctified the marriage. Arthur\nknew, Lyanna was dying and that Ned Stark was on his way to the tower of joy.\nThat letter had been meant to go with the child once Ned Stark had been dealt\nwith.\u201d</p><p>Jon stared\nat Sam and willed him to stop, but his mind was blank, and words would not\ncome.</p><p>\u201cYou know\nwhat happened. Ned Stark came to the Tower of Joy. Arthur Dayne and the\nkingsguards were killed. Ned found Lyanna dying or dead. \u00a0He just never mentioned that she had died in\nchild bed.\u201d</p><p>Jon could\nhear his own ragged breath loudly in his ear.

Awake\nhe knew that he had somehow shared the thoughts of the green dragon, Rhaegal.\nIt had felt strange, exhausting, alien, not like the bond he shared with Ghost.\nThe dragon was flame and hunger, his thoughts about the humans around him laced\nwith contempt. Jon felt much more comfortable in Ghost. He knew that\ncontrolling the dragon would never be easy, if he even wanted to take that\npath.</p><p>When he lay\nawake he wondered what the woman sleeping beside him would make of his\nconnection to the dragon. He had never told anybody about Ghost. Should he tell\nher? She hadn\u2019t wondered why Rhaegal had flown as high as Drogon. Was she\nconnected to the black dragon like he was to the green? Jon didn\u2019t know what to\nmake of it. His thoughts wandered to Ghost, to Winterfell and to Sansa. It had\nbeen pleasant enough to have Daenerys in his arms. She had a natural joy in sex\nthat was endearing, but he knew that he would never love her. His body had\nreacted readily, but his thoughts had been detached, and his soul had felt no\nconnection. Daenerys had gone to sleep almost immediately while Jon had twisted\nand turned. His thoughts, when not circling around the dragon, were drawn to\nSansa and the fevered words she had spoken to Ghost when he had dreamed of the\nweirwood north of the Wall. <i>There is\nnothing we can do about it. I love her, but I cannot have her. She\u2019ll marry\nSweetrobin or Littlefinger to forge an alliance that helps the North. </i>He\nfervently hoped that Lord Royce had it wrong. The thought of Littlefinger as\nSansa\u2019s husband made Jon\u2019s stomach burn in hatred. He flexed his fingers,\nimagining driving Longclaw through Littlefinger\u2019s throat. Sweetrobin was\nbetter. As far as Jon knew he was not yet a man and it should be possible to\npostpone a wedding. <i>To what purpose\nthough? You cannot have her. </i>Jon sighed and looked at the woman beside him.\nDaenerys\u2019 face looked peaceful in sleep. <i>I\nmight as well try to get along with my new ally. We\u2019ll be stuck here at\nSaltpans until a ship comes anyway.</i></p><p>When his\nrestless thoughts finally came to a halt and blessed dreamless sleep took him, it\nmust have been already in the early hours of the day, because when he woke up,\nthe sun was high up in the sky. His tongue felt dry and strange in his mouth.\nHe suspected that the air was still affected by the fire that had burned\nyesterday. He was laying alone in the bed, his face to the windows. When he\nconcentrated he could feel air swirling around him and sunshine on wings and a\ndistant feeling of hunger that would soon become stronger. He shook himself, sat\nup and turned. </p><p>Daenerys\nwas sitting on a chair beside his bed, her face a strange and distant mask, her\ngaze cool and queenly. Jon shrank back. <i>I\nthought we had come to an understanding? </i>In her hands, there were two\nscrolls, and Jon\u2019s heart began to pound wildly, when he realised that she held\nthe letters from Winterfell, he had carried in his tunic all the way from\nDragonstone, to the wall and back.</p><p>\u201cJon Snow, you\nare finally awake.\u201d Daenerys said. Her voice sounded pressed, as if she\ncontained her anger. \u201cYou claim to be a King\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy people\nchose me as their King\u201d Jon answered warily. He did not know what to make of\nher obvious anger. He felt at a disadvantage being still naked while she was in\nregal attire. </p><p>\u201cDo they\nknow you just do the bidding of your sisters?\u201d she asked. </p><p>\u201cWhy would\nyou say that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYour\nsisters told you to seduce me.\u201d Daenerys opened the letters.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jon\nwas taken aback. </p><p>\u201c<i>Please remember your courtesies when you\nspeak with the Queen. I hear she is young and beautiful and she might be\nsympathetic to a very handsome king known for his skills with a sword</i>.\u201d\nDaenerys quoted from Sansa\u2019s letter. \u201c<i>If\nthe dragon queen makes trouble, just stick her with the pointy end.\u2019</i>\u201d That\nwas from the short paragraph Arya had written.</p><p>For a\nmoment, Jon was at a loss for words. </p><p>\u201cThis is\nnot what you think\u201d he finally said. \u201cNeither of them was talking about\nseducing you. Sansa just wanted me to mind my courtesies and Arya\u2026. \u201c Jon tried\nto think of something to say and licked his lips. \u201c\u2026. It\u2019s a joke we used to\nmake. Pointy end is just the end of her sword.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys\nscowled. \u201cAre you telling me your sister told you to kill me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course\nnot,\u201d Jon leapt to Arya\u2019s defence. \u201cIt is a joke. A joke. And if you hadn\u2019t\nread letters not meant for you, you would not be in the situation to\nmisunderstand.\u201d He was getting angry himself now. <i>She read Sansa\u2019s letters to me! </i></p><p>He stood\nup, not caring for his nudity and snatched the letters from Daenerys\u2019 hands. </p><p>\u201cBe\ncareful, King Snow,\u201d Daenerys said. Her gaze pierced him. He could see that she\ndid not believe him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t\nhave that many men at your disposal right now. I could have you arrested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI helped\nsave your men.\u201d Jon protested.</p><p>Daenerys\nbarked a laugh. \u201cTell me, how did you save anybody? You killed Euron, but he\nwas already down. And your woman Brienne killed my dragon! Greyworm told me\nabout it. You held that back yesterday!\u201d</p><p>For a brief\nmoment, Jon was tempted to tell her about his connection to Rhaegal, that had\nat least in part saved the situation, but he bit his tongue. This was not the\nright time to confide to the enraged queen.</p><p>He took a\ndeep breath and willed his own anger away. There was no use in a shouting\nmatch. With as much dignity as he could muster he threw over his tunic and\nstepped in his trousers. Then he turned to the queen and tried to talk calm and\ncollected.</p><p>\u201cBrienne\nkilled the dragon who was under the thrall of the horn. I cleared the docks, so\nthat the dragons in their grief would not hurt more people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then\nyou didn\u2019t tell me who killed the dragon. And in the night, you acted at your\nsisters\u2019 advice. Where is Brienne now? I might be inclined to overlook your\nimpudence, if you tell me where she is. And the kingslayer. He might have\nhelped her.\u201d Daenerys made no effort to keep her voice low.</p><p>Jon willed\nhimself to calm. \u201cYour Grace, I ordered Brienne to leave and make for Winterfell.\nI don\u2019t know where she is.\u201d <i>Nor would I\ntell you, if I knew it, not in your current state of mind.</i></p><p>\u201cAs for the\nnight,\u201d he gave a short bow. \u201cI plead with you to believe me, that there was no\nill intent on my side. We need you and your dragons to fight against the White\nWalkers. You saw for yourself how dangerous the situation is. You saw the wight\nwe brought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need\nme? Or you need my dragons?\u201d, Daenerys\u2019 voice was not as loud as before, but\nthat did not reassure Jon. Her eyes glittered.</p><p>\u201cYour\ngrace, we all need your dragons. When I was north of the Wall, Thoros of Myr\ntold me that the wall is growing weaker. The seven kingdoms will face an\ninvasion of the White Walkers and the Undead\u201d, he tried to explain. \u201cYou told\nme that you would fight with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you\nthat I would fight with you, before one of my dragons was killed, before the\ntruce with the Lannisters was shattered, before you lied to me about the person\nwho killed my child.\u201d She took a breath.</p><p>\u201cIf I go\nNorth with you, Cersei will retake the entire South.\u201d She added.</p><p>\u201cIf you\ndon\u2019t go North, it won\u2019t matter who holds the South,\u201d Jon argued. \u201cThe White\nWalkers will conquer the North and then they will come for you. Do you think\nthe Neck will stop them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want\nme to turn my back on the South and fight with you? And afterwards? Your sister\nholds the Vale and the Riverlands. You the North, Cersei will hold the South.\nWhat will be left for me?\u201d Daenerys demanded.</p><p>\u201cMy sister\nwill hold the Vale?\u201d Jon asked. <i>How would\nshe know?</i></p><p>\u201cMy hand\nhas his methods to get information.\u201d Daenerys said haughtily.</p><p><i>Which letter? Did Tyrion see Lord Royce\u2019s\nletter or Arya\u2019s ramblings? Probably not Arya\u2019s letter or she wouldn\u2019t suspect\nArya to have advised me to seduce her.</i></p><p>\u201cYour\ngrace,\u201d Jon willed her to listen. \u201cI secured you the proof you needed. It is\nnot my fault that Cersei got wind of our parley. It is not my fault that Euron\ntried to steal your dragons. It\u2019s not my fault one of your dragons had to be\nkilled to save people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should\njust have destroyed the horn.\u201d Daenerys interrupted him. \u201cViserion could have\nshook of the bonds then.\u201d</p><p>Jon looked\nat her, his own anger was slowly getting hold of him. <i>Did she not see the danger?</i></p><p>\u201cYour\ngrace, I admit that this would have been better, but Euron\u2019s pirates were\nthrowing what we thought was wildfire. We are all lucky to have escaped alive.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes\nglittered again, and Jon realised that she was fighting tears, if they were\ntears of anger, grief or hurt, he could not have said.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\nyour grace. You are angry and distressed. We should not continue our talk,\nbefore we are both calmer. I beg you to reconsider everything I\u2019ve done. I gave\nyou my word, we had an understanding.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys\nopened her mouth, and Jon could see that she was about to lash out again, but they\nwere interrupted by a knock on the door. Davos entered immediately after\nknocking.</p><p>Jon was\nglad that he had dressed. He could see two Unsullied at the door, but they were\noutnumbered by a dozen men who wore the uniforms of the City Watch of King\u2019s\nLanding.</p><p>\u201cYour\ngrace.\u201d Davos bowed. \u201cI finally managed to get rooms fit for a king. I am sure,\nafter you and Queen Daenerys have discussed politics the whole morning, you\nneed rest.\u201d </p><p>Davos\u2019 eyes\nwere pleading with him. He even went as far as extending a hand. Daenerys\nlooked from him to the two Unsullied and Jon could see her calculating if she\nshould give the order to seize them. The Unsullied were good fighters, but the\ncity watch outnumbered them. She let her hands fall to her side.</p><p>Jon nodded.\nHe put the letters he still held in his tunic and snatched at Longclaw.</p><p>He bowed\ndeeply to Daenerys. \u201cYour grace, I hope we can continue this talk another\ntime.\u201d Whatever good luck had brought Davos to him, he would not risk being\ndetained by an enraged queen.</p><p>Daenerys\ngave him a nod that was halfway between gracious and haughty. </p><p>\u201cWe will\ncontinue our talk. Circumstances have changed, and I think we must renegotiate.\nIf you want my army and my dragons you will pay the price I name. I shall\nponder what that might be.\u201d </p><p>That was\nnot what Jon had hoped when he had entered her room yesterday. <i>How did it all go wrong? Why did she have to\nread my letters? Why did that damned Lannister look at the letters I was sent?</i></p><p>They left\nthe house in the midst of reassuring regular beating strides of the soldiers\nDavos had brought. </p><p>\u201cDo you\ntrust them?\u201d Jon whispered, gesturing at the guards. </p><p>\u201cThese are\nGendry\u2019s men. They work against Queen Cersei.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did\nyou come looking for me?\u201d he asked his Hand.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to\nensure your safety.\u201d Davos answered. </p><p>\u201cYou did\nwell, but how did you know that things went awry? Not, that I complain.\u201d </p><p>Davos\nlooked at him with concern in his eyes. </p><p>\u201cDid Queen Daenerys\nfind out? Was that, why she was shouting? I\u2019m sure you could have preferred to\nfind out in another way.\u201d He laid a hand on his arm.</p><p>Jon was\nconfused. \u201cFind out what? Daenerys was angry that Brienne killed her dragon\u201d.\nHe shook his head still wondering how Daenerys had not realised how dangerous the\nsituation with the dragons had been. \u201cand\u2026.\u201d He could feel the blood creeping\nin his cheeks. \u201cShe read my sisters\u2019 letters. She misunderstood them. She\nthought, Sansa had ordered me to seduce her. Tyrion must have told her about\nthe planned alliance with the Vale.\u201d</p><p>Davos nodded.\n\u201cUnfortunately, there are ways to open a letter and leave the seal undamaged.\nIt is unfortunate, that Lord Tyrion found out about the planned alliance with\nthe Vale.\u201d</p><p>They were\nrounding a corner and approached a house at the docks, that Davos must have had\nchosen because it was close to the water. They could defend it with only a few\nmen.</p><p>\u201cBut I was\ntalking about something else. It does not bode well, that you fell out with the\nqueen. You are in great danger, but we might keep things quiet and secret for\nnow.\u201d Davos said. Jon was at a loss what he meant.</p><p>When they\nentered the house, Davos ordered the men to secure the house from all corners.\nHis face was worried. Jon was worried as well. <i>What will Daenerys demand? Our whole trip North of the wall was for\nnothing. We don\u2019t get the Lannister army, I\u2019m stuck here, with only two dozen\nmen, most of them not my own, and Daenerys will make demands for an alliance,\njust because she thinks I\u2019m backed in a corner and her war does no go as she\nwants.</i></p><p>Davos led\nJon up the stairs. \u201cThere is someone you have to see.\u201d </p><p>When Jon\nentered the small room on top of the stairs, he felt a rush of real joy. </p><p>\u201cSam\u201d, he\ncried out and ran to hug his friend. </p><p>Sam hugged\nhim back, but soon stepped back. </p><p>\u201cHow are\nyou, why are you here? Where is Gilly?\u201d Jon asked.</p><p>Sam didn\u2019t\nanswer anything, but looked at him with sad and earnest eyes. </p><p>\u201cJon, you\nhave to leave here as fast as possible. You are in great danger.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t\nbe the first time,\u201d Jon joked. \u201cWhat is it this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\nthink you are safe anywhere near Daenerys Targaryen.\u201d Sam answered.</p><p>He shoved\nhis hair out of his face. Jon realised that he looked travel-worn and that he\nhad lost weight. </p><p>\u201cI came as\nfast as I could. You are in danger, because you are a threat to her claim.\u201d Sam\ncombed his hair nervously with his fingers. \n\u201cI don\u2019t really know, how to tell you this\u2026.\u201d </p><p>Sam somehow\nurged him to take a seat. Jon was puzzled. He had never seen his friend that\nfussing about. He obliged him and sat down. Sam sat beside him and looked at\nthe floor.</p><p>He made\nseveral attempts to start until he finally burst out: \u201cI was assigned to bring\norder to a letter collection from the mad king\u2019s reign. Tedious work, nobody\nhad ever looked at it, over 1000 letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was\na letter by Arthur Dayne, the kingsguard, to his sister Ashara. It was written\nafter Rhaegar had fallen at the Trident and the Mad King had been murdered. He\nasked his sister if she would be willing to raise a child to save it from\nRobert\u2019s wrath. He wanted her to claim it was her son, hers and Brandon Starks,\nwhen it was Rhaegar\u2019s son.\u201d</p><p>Jon\nfrowned. \u201cAegon, Rhaegar\u2019s son, was killed by the mountain in the sack of\nKing\u2019s Landing, everybody knows that.\u201d </p><p>Sam shook\nhis head \u201cNot that son. Rhaegar\u2019s and Lyanna\u2019s son.\u201d</p><p>Jon\nsuddenly felt dizzy.</p><p>\u201cWhat do\nyou want to say?\u201d But he didn\u2019t really need to be told. Somehow, he knew.</p><p>\u201cLyanna had\na son. Arthur Dayne wanted to save the son of his prince. A son, he considered\nlegitimate, because Rhaegar had taken Lyanna as a second wife, like the\nTargaryens of old. The High Septon himself sanctified the marriage. Arthur\nknew, Lyanna was dying and that Ned Stark was on his way to the tower of joy.\nThat letter had been meant to go with the child once Ned Stark had been dealt\nwith.\u201d</p><p>Jon stared\nat Sam and willed him to stop, but his mind was blank, and words would not\ncome.</p><p>\u201cYou know\nwhat happened. Ned Stark came to the Tower of Joy. Arthur Dayne and the\nkingsguards were killed. Ned found Lyanna dying or dead. \u00a0He just never mentioned that she had died in\nchild bed.\u201d</p><p>Jon could\nhear his own ragged breath loudly in his ear. He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d Sam\nurged him to look at him. \u201cNed Stark was your uncle. You\u2019re not his bastard.\nYou\u2019re Lyanna\u2019s son.\u201d</p><p>Jon shook\nhis head again.</p><p>Sam sighed.\n\u201cYou know, if anybody had known that Lyanna was pregnant, I doubt I\u2019d be the\nonly one to come to the conclusion that Ned Stark hid you in plain sight.\u201d </p><p>Jon could\nfeel sweat breaking out on his forehead. <i>The\ndragon, Rhaegal\u2026. I felt him\u2026. Daenerys\u2026. Rhaegar\u2019s sister\u2026. My aunt\u2026. Sansa\u2026\nMy cousin, not my sister. I\u2019m a Targaryen. I\u2019m not a Stark, </i>His mind\nreeled, his thoughts spun. </p><p>Suddenly,\nthe wheel in his mind stopped, and he felt like his thoughts burst. He heard\nhimself laugh, a cackling laugh, that sounded so strange, or was he sobbing? He\nfelt his cheeks that were wet, and suddenly and violently he felt sick and vomited\nnoisily on the floor. </p>",

The excrement is about to hit the airing device. Jon Snow wakes up to find an enraged Da\u20acnerys at his bedside. Also on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/8470255/chapters/36291405\">AO3</a>.</p><p>Jon only\ngrabbed occasional bouts of sleep during the night, and when he slept his\ndreams were disturbed by strange feelings. He felt the loss of a brother that\nhad just died and anger at the human who had ordered him to fly high. He knew\nhe had escaped the dreadful sound of the horn, but he had also wanted to\neliminate the man who had dared to try to conquer him. When he felt his brother\ndie, he had wanted to revenge his brother, although he had no clear idea who\nhad killed him. Was it the man who had blown the horn? Was it one of the other\nant-like wraiths he had seen from far above? He didn\u2019t know. <br></p>[[MORE]]<p>When Jon\nhad been awake in between his dreams he had felt cold sweat on his brow. Awake\nhe knew that he had somehow shared the thoughts of the green dragon, Rhaegal.\nIt had felt strange, exhausting, alien, not like the bond he shared with Ghost.\nThe dragon was flame and hunger, his thoughts about the humans around him laced\nwith contempt. Jon felt much more comfortable in Ghost. He knew that\ncontrolling the dragon would never be easy, if he even wanted to take that\npath.</p><p>When he lay\nawake he wondered what the woman sleeping beside him would make of his\nconnection to the dragon. He had never told anybody about Ghost. Should he tell\nher? She hadn\u2019t wondered why Rhaegal had flown as high as Drogon. Was she\nconnected to the black dragon like he was to the green? Jon didn\u2019t know what to\nmake of it. His thoughts wandered to Ghost, to Winterfell and to Sansa. It had\nbeen pleasant enough to have Daenerys in his arms. She had a natural joy in sex\nthat was endearing, but he knew that he would never love her. His body had\nreacted readily, but his thoughts had been detached, and his soul had felt no\nconnection. Daenerys had gone to sleep almost immediately while Jon had twisted\nand turned. His thoughts, when not circling around the dragon, were drawn to\nSansa and the fevered words she had spoken to Ghost when he had dreamed of the\nweirwood north of the Wall. <i>There is\nnothing we can do about it. I love her, but I cannot have her. She\u2019ll marry\nSweetrobin or Littlefinger to forge an alliance that helps the North. </i>He\nfervently hoped that Lord Royce had it wrong. The thought of Littlefinger as\nSansa\u2019s husband made Jon\u2019s stomach burn in hatred. He flexed his fingers,\nimagining driving Longclaw through Littlefinger\u2019s throat. Sweetrobin was\nbetter. As far as Jon knew he was not yet a man and it should be possible to\npostpone a wedding. <i>To what purpose\nthough? You cannot have her. </i>Jon sighed and looked at the woman beside him.\nDaenerys\u2019 face looked peaceful in sleep. <i>I\nmight as well try to get along with my new ally. We\u2019ll be stuck here at\nSaltpans until a ship comes anyway.</i></p><p>When his\nrestless thoughts finally came to a halt and blessed dreamless sleep took him, it\nmust have been already in the early hours of the day, because when he woke up,\nthe sun was high up in the sky. His tongue felt dry and strange in his mouth.\nHe suspected that the air was still affected by the fire that had burned\nyesterday. He was laying alone in the bed, his face to the windows. When he\nconcentrated he could feel air swirling around him and sunshine on wings and a\ndistant feeling of hunger that would soon become stronger. He shook himself, sat\nup and turned. </p><p>Daenerys\nwas sitting on a chair beside his bed, her face a strange and distant mask, her\ngaze cool and queenly. Jon shrank back. <i>I\nthought we had come to an understanding? </i>In her hands, there were two\nscrolls, and Jon\u2019s heart began to pound wildly, when he realised that she held\nthe letters from Winterfell, he had carried in his tunic all the way from\nDragonstone, to the wall and back.</p><p>\u201cJon Snow, you\nare finally awake.\u201d Daenerys said. Her voice sounded pressed, as if she\ncontained her anger. \u201cYou claim to be a King\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy people\nchose me as their King\u201d Jon answered warily. He did not know what to make of\nher obvious anger. He felt at a disadvantage being still naked while she was in\nregal attire. </p><p>\u201cDo they\nknow you just do the bidding of your sisters?\u201d she asked. </p><p>\u201cWhy would\nyou say that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYour\nsisters told you to seduce me.\u201d Daenerys opened the letters.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jon\nwas taken aback. </p><p>\u201c<i>Please remember your courtesies when you\nspeak with the Queen. I hear she is young and beautiful and she might be\nsympathetic to a very handsome king known for his skills with a sword</i>.\u201d\nDaenerys quoted from Sansa\u2019s letter. \u201c<i>If\nthe dragon queen makes trouble, just stick her with the pointy end.\u2019</i>\u201d That\nwas from the short paragraph Arya had written.</p><p>For a\nmoment, Jon was at a loss for words. </p><p>\u201cThis is\nnot what you think\u201d he finally said. \u201cNeither of them was talking about\nseducing you. Sansa just wanted me to mind my courtesies and Arya\u2026. \u201c Jon tried\nto think of something to say and licked his lips. \u201c\u2026. It\u2019s a joke we used to\nmake. Pointy end is just the end of her sword.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys\nscowled. \u201cAre you telling me your sister told you to kill me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course\nnot,\u201d Jon leapt to Arya\u2019s defence. \u201cIt is a joke. A joke. And if you hadn\u2019t\nread letters not meant for you, you would not be in the situation to\nmisunderstand.\u201d He was getting angry himself now. <i>She read Sansa\u2019s letters to me! </i></p><p>He stood\nup, not caring for his nudity and snatched the letters from Daenerys\u2019 hands. </p><p>\u201cBe\ncareful, King Snow,\u201d Daenerys said. Her gaze pierced him. He could see that she\ndid not believe him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t\nhave that many men at your disposal right now. I could have you arrested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI helped\nsave your men.\u201d Jon protested.</p><p>Daenerys\nbarked a laugh. \u201cTell me, how did you save anybody? You killed Euron, but he\nwas already down. And your woman Brienne killed my dragon! Greyworm told me\nabout it. You held that back yesterday!\u201d</p><p>For a brief\nmoment, Jon was tempted to tell her about his connection to Rhaegal, that had\nat least in part saved the situation, but he bit his tongue. This was not the\nright time to confide to the enraged queen.</p><p>He took a\ndeep breath and willed his own anger away. There was no use in a shouting\nmatch. With as much dignity as he could muster he threw over his tunic and\nstepped in his trousers. Then he turned to the queen and tried to talk calm and\ncollected.</p><p>\u201cBrienne\nkilled the dragon who was under the thrall of the horn. I cleared the docks, so\nthat the dragons in their grief would not hurt more people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then\nyou didn\u2019t tell me who killed the dragon. And in the night, you acted at your\nsisters\u2019 advice. Where is Brienne now? I might be inclined to overlook your\nimpudence, if you tell me where she is. And the kingslayer. He might have\nhelped her.\u201d Daenerys made no effort to keep her voice low.</p><p>Jon willed\nhimself to calm. \u201cYour Grace, I ordered Brienne to leave and make for Winterfell.\nI don\u2019t know where she is.\u201d <i>Nor would I\ntell you, if I knew it, not in your current state of mind.</i></p><p>\u201cAs for the\nnight,\u201d he gave a short bow. \u201cI plead with you to believe me, that there was no\nill intent on my side. We need you and your dragons to fight against the White\nWalkers. You saw for yourself how dangerous the situation is. You saw the wight\nwe brought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need\nme? Or you need my dragons?\u201d, Daenerys\u2019 voice was not as loud as before, but\nthat did not reassure Jon. Her eyes glittered.</p><p>\u201cYour\ngrace, we all need your dragons. When I was north of the Wall, Thoros of Myr\ntold me that the wall is growing weaker. The seven kingdoms will face an\ninvasion of the White Walkers and the Undead\u201d, he tried to explain. \u201cYou told\nme that you would fight with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you\nthat I would fight with you, before one of my dragons was killed, before the\ntruce with the Lannisters was shattered, before you lied to me about the person\nwho killed my child.\u201d She took a breath.</p><p>\u201cIf I go\nNorth with you, Cersei will retake the entire South.\u201d She added.</p><p>\u201cIf you\ndon\u2019t go North, it won\u2019t matter who holds the South,\u201d Jon argued. \u201cThe White\nWalkers will conquer the North and then they will come for you. Do you think\nthe Neck will stop them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want\nme to turn my back on the South and fight with you? And afterwards? Your sister\nholds the Vale and the Riverlands. You the North, Cersei will hold the South.\nWhat will be left for me?\u201d Daenerys demanded.</p><p>\u201cMy sister\nwill hold the Vale?\u201d Jon asked. <i>How would\nshe know?</i></p><p>\u201cMy hand\nhas his methods to get information.\u201d Daenerys said haughtily.</p><p><i>Which letter? Did Tyrion see Lord Royce\u2019s\nletter or Arya\u2019s ramblings? Probably not Arya\u2019s letter or she wouldn\u2019t suspect\nArya to have advised me to seduce her.</i></p><p>\u201cYour\ngrace,\u201d Jon willed her to listen. \u201cI secured you the proof you needed. It is\nnot my fault that Cersei got wind of our parley. It is not my fault that Euron\ntried to steal your dragons. It\u2019s not my fault one of your dragons had to be\nkilled to save people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should\njust have destroyed the horn.\u201d Daenerys interrupted him. \u201cViserion could have\nshook of the bonds then.\u201d</p><p>Jon looked\nat her, his own anger was slowly getting hold of him. <i>Did she not see the danger?</i></p><p>\u201cYour\ngrace, I admit that this would have been better, but Euron\u2019s pirates were\nthrowing what we thought was wildfire. We are all lucky to have escaped alive.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes\nglittered again, and Jon realised that she was fighting tears, if they were\ntears of anger, grief or hurt, he could not have said.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\nyour grace. You are angry and distressed. We should not continue our talk,\nbefore we are both calmer. I beg you to reconsider everything I\u2019ve done. I gave\nyou my word, we had an understanding.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys\nopened her mouth, and Jon could see that she was about to lash out again, but they\nwere interrupted by a knock on the door. Davos entered immediately after\nknocking.</p><p>Jon was\nglad that he had dressed. He could see two Unsullied at the door, but they were\noutnumbered by a dozen men who wore the uniforms of the City Watch of King\u2019s\nLanding.</p><p>\u201cYour\ngrace.\u201d Davos bowed. \u201cI finally managed to get rooms fit for a king. I am sure,\nafter you and Queen Daenerys have discussed politics the whole morning, you\nneed rest.\u201d </p><p>Davos\u2019 eyes\nwere pleading with him. He even went as far as extending a hand. Daenerys\nlooked from him to the two Unsullied and Jon could see her calculating if she\nshould give the order to seize them. The Unsullied were good fighters, but the\ncity watch outnumbered them. She let her hands fall to her side.</p><p>Jon nodded.\nHe put the letters he still held in his tunic and snatched at Longclaw.</p><p>He bowed\ndeeply to Daenerys. \u201cYour grace, I hope we can continue this talk another\ntime.\u201d Whatever good luck had brought Davos to him, he would not risk being\ndetained by an enraged queen.</p><p>Daenerys\ngave him a nod that was halfway between gracious and haughty. </p><p>\u201cWe will\ncontinue our talk. Circumstances have changed, and I think we must renegotiate.\nIf you want my army and my dragons you will pay the price I name. I shall\nponder what that might be.\u201d </p><p>That was\nnot what Jon had hoped when he had entered her room yesterday. <i>How did it all go wrong? Why did she have to\nread my letters? Why did that damned Lannister look at the letters I was sent?</i></p><p>They left\nthe house in the midst of reassuring regular beating strides of the soldiers\nDavos had brought. </p><p>\u201cDo you\ntrust them?\u201d Jon whispered, gesturing at the guards. </p><p>\u201cThese are\nGendry\u2019s men. They work against Queen Cersei.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did\nyou come looking for me?\u201d he asked his Hand.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to\nensure your safety.\u201d Davos answered. </p><p>\u201cYou did\nwell, but how did you know that things went awry? Not, that I complain.\u201d </p><p>Davos\nlooked at him with concern in his eyes. </p><p>\u201cDid Queen Daenerys\nfind out? Was that, why she was shouting? I\u2019m sure you could have preferred to\nfind out in another way.\u201d He laid a hand on his arm.</p><p>Jon was\nconfused. \u201cFind out what? Daenerys was angry that Brienne killed her dragon\u201d.\nHe shook his head still wondering how Daenerys had not realised how dangerous the\nsituation with the dragons had been. \u201cand\u2026.\u201d He could feel the blood creeping\nin his cheeks. \u201cShe read my sisters\u2019 letters. She misunderstood them. She\nthought, Sansa had ordered me to seduce her. Tyrion must have told her about\nthe planned alliance with the Vale.\u201d</p><p>Davos nodded.\n\u201cUnfortunately, there are ways to open a letter and leave the seal undamaged.\nIt is unfortunate, that Lord Tyrion found out about the planned alliance with\nthe Vale.\u201d</p><p>They were\nrounding a corner and approached a house at the docks, that Davos must have had\nchosen because it was close to the water. They could defend it with only a few\nmen.</p><p>\u201cBut I was\ntalking about something else. It does not bode well, that you fell out with the\nqueen. You are in great danger, but we might keep things quiet and secret for\nnow.\u201d Davos said. Jon was at a loss what he meant.</p><p>When they\nentered the house, Davos ordered the men to secure the house from all corners.\nHis face was worried. Jon was worried as well. <i>What will Daenerys demand? Our whole trip North of the wall was for\nnothing. We don\u2019t get the Lannister army, I\u2019m stuck here, with only two dozen\nmen, most of them not my own, and Daenerys will make demands for an alliance,\njust because she thinks I\u2019m backed in a corner and her war does no go as she\nwants.</i></p><p>Davos led\nJon up the stairs. \u201cThere is someone you have to see.\u201d </p><p>When Jon\nentered the small room on top of the stairs, he felt a rush of real joy. </p><p>\u201cSam\u201d, he\ncried out and ran to hug his friend. </p><p>Sam hugged\nhim back, but soon stepped back. </p><p>\u201cHow are\nyou, why are you here? Where is Gilly?\u201d Jon asked.</p><p>Sam didn\u2019t\nanswer anything, but looked at him with sad and earnest eyes. </p><p>\u201cJon, you\nhave to leave here as fast as possible. You are in great danger.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t\nbe the first time,\u201d Jon joked. \u201cWhat is it this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\nthink you are safe anywhere near Daenerys Targaryen.\u201d Sam answered.</p><p>He shoved\nhis hair out of his face. Jon realised that he looked travel-worn and that he\nhad lost weight. </p><p>\u201cI came as\nfast as I could. You are in danger, because you are a threat to her claim.\u201d Sam\ncombed his hair nervously with his fingers. \n\u201cI don\u2019t really know, how to tell you this\u2026.\u201d </p><p>Sam somehow\nurged him to take a seat. Jon was puzzled. He had never seen his friend that\nfussing about. He obliged him and sat down. Sam sat beside him and looked at\nthe floor.</p><p>He made\nseveral attempts to start until he finally burst out: \u201cI was assigned to bring\norder to a letter collection from the mad king\u2019s reign. Tedious work, nobody\nhad ever looked at it, over 1000 letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was\na letter by Arthur Dayne, the kingsguard, to his sister Ashara. It was written\nafter Rhaegar had fallen at the Trident and the Mad King had been murdered. He\nasked his sister if she would be willing to raise a child to save it from\nRobert\u2019s wrath. He wanted her to claim it was her son, hers and Brandon Starks,\nwhen it was Rhaegar\u2019s son.\u201d</p><p>Jon\nfrowned. \u201cAegon, Rhaegar\u2019s son, was killed by the mountain in the sack of\nKing\u2019s Landing, everybody knows that.\u201d </p><p>Sam shook\nhis head \u201cNot that son. Rhaegar\u2019s and Lyanna\u2019s son.\u201d</p><p>Jon\nsuddenly felt dizzy.</p><p>\u201cWhat do\nyou want to say?\u201d But he didn\u2019t really need to be told. Somehow, he knew.</p><p>\u201cLyanna had\na son. Arthur Dayne wanted to save the son of his prince. A son, he considered\nlegitimate, because Rhaegar had taken Lyanna as a second wife, like the\nTargaryens of old. The High Septon himself sanctified the marriage. Arthur\nknew, Lyanna was dying and that Ned Stark was on his way to the tower of joy.\nThat letter had been meant to go with the child once Ned Stark had been dealt\nwith.\u201d</p><p>Jon stared\nat Sam and willed him to stop, but his mind was blank, and words would not\ncome.</p><p>\u201cYou know\nwhat happened. Ned Stark came to the Tower of Joy. Arthur Dayne and the\nkingsguards were killed. Ned found Lyanna dying or dead. \u00a0He just never mentioned that she had died in\nchild bed.\u201d</p><p>Jon could\nhear his own ragged breath loudly in his ear. He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d Sam\nurged him to look at him. \u201cNed Stark was your uncle. You\u2019re not his bastard.\nYou\u2019re Lyanna\u2019s son.\u201d</p><p>Jon shook\nhis head again.</p><p>Sam sighed.\n\u201cYou know, if anybody had known that Lyanna was pregnant, I doubt I\u2019d be the\nonly one to come to the conclusion that Ned Stark hid you in plain sight.\u201d </p><p>Jon could\nfeel sweat breaking out on his forehead. <i>The\ndragon, Rhaegal\u2026. I felt him\u2026. Daenerys\u2026. Rhaegar\u2019s sister\u2026. My aunt\u2026. Sansa\u2026\nMy cousin, not my sister. I\u2019m a Targaryen. I\u2019m not a Stark, </i>His mind\nreeled, his thoughts spun. </p><p>Suddenly,\nthe wheel in his mind stopped, and he felt like his thoughts burst. He heard\nhimself laugh, a cackling laugh, that sounded so strange, or was he sobbing? He\nfelt his cheeks that were wet, and suddenly and violently he felt sick and vomited\nnoisily on the floor. </p>",

You killed Euron, but he\nwas already down. And your woman Brienne killed my dragon! Greyworm told me\nabout it. You held that back yesterday!&rdquo;</p><p>For a brief\nmoment, Jon was tempted to tell her about his connection to Rhaegal, that had\nat least in part saved the situation, but he bit his tongue. This was not the\nright time to confide to the enraged queen.</p><p>He took a\ndeep breath and willed his own anger away. There was no use in a shouting\nmatch. With as much dignity as he could muster he threw over his tunic and\nstepped in his trousers. Then he turned to the queen and tried to talk calm and\ncollected.</p><p>&ldquo;Brienne\nkilled the dragon who was under the thrall of the horn. I cleared the docks, so\nthat the dragons in their grief would not hurt more people.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And then\nyou didn&rsquo;t tell me who killed the dragon. And in the night, you acted at your\nsisters&rsquo; advice. Where is Brienne now? I might be inclined to overlook your\nimpudence, if you tell me where she is. And the kingslayer. He might have\nhelped her.&rdquo; Daenerys made no effort to keep her voice low.</p><p>Jon willed\nhimself to calm. &ldquo;Your Grace, I ordered Brienne to leave and make for Winterfell.\nI don&rsquo;t know where she is.&rdquo; <i>Nor would I\ntell you, if I knew it, not in your current state of mind.</i></p><p>&ldquo;As for the\nnight,&rdquo; he gave a short bow. &ldquo;I plead with you to believe me, that there was no\nill intent on my side. We need you and your dragons to fight against the White\nWalkers. You saw for yourself how dangerous the situation is. You saw the wight\nwe brought.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You need\nme? Or you need my dragons?&rdquo;, Daenerys&rsquo; voice was not as loud as before, but\nthat did not reassure Jon. Her eyes glittered.</p><p>&ldquo;Your\ngrace, we all need your dragons. When I was north of the Wall, Thoros of Myr\ntold me that the wall is growing weaker. The seven kingdoms will face an\ninvasion of the White Walkers and the Undead&rdquo;, he tried to explain. &ldquo;You told\nme that you would fight with us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I told you\nthat I would fight with you, before one of my dragons was killed, before the\ntruce with the Lannisters was shattered, before you lied to me about the person\nwho killed my child.&rdquo; She took a breath.</p><p>&ldquo;If I go\nNorth with you, Cersei will retake the entire South.&rdquo; She added.</p><p>&ldquo;If you\ndon&rsquo;t go North, it won&rsquo;t matter who holds the South,&rdquo; Jon argued. &ldquo;The White\nWalkers will conquer the North and then they will come for you. Do you think\nthe Neck will stop them?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You want\nme to turn my back on the South and fight with you? And afterwards? Your sister\nholds the Vale and the Riverlands. You the North, Cersei will hold the South.\nWhat will be left for me?&rdquo; Daenerys demanded.</p><p>&ldquo;My sister\nwill hold the Vale?&rdquo; Jon asked. <i>How would\nshe know?</i></p><p>&ldquo;My hand\nhas his methods to get information.&rdquo; Daenerys said haughtily.</p><p><i>Which letter? Did Tyrion see Lord Royce&rsquo;s\nletter or Arya&rsquo;s ramblings? Probably not Arya&rsquo;s letter or she wouldn&rsquo;t suspect\nArya to have advised me to seduce her.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Your\ngrace,&rdquo; Jon willed her to listen. &ldquo;I secured you the proof you needed. It is\nnot my fault that Cersei got wind of our parley. It is not my fault that Euron\ntried to steal your dragons. It&rsquo;s not my fault one of your dragons had to be\nkilled to save people.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We should\njust have destroyed the horn.&rdquo; Daenerys interrupted him. &ldquo;Viserion could have\nshook of the bonds then.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon looked\nat her, his own anger was slowly getting hold of him. <i>Did she not see the danger?</i></p><p>&ldquo;Your\ngrace, I admit that this would have been better, but Euron&rsquo;s pirates were\nthrowing what we thought was wildfire. We are all lucky to have escaped alive.&rdquo;</p><p>Her eyes\nglittered again, and Jon realised that she was fighting tears, if they were\ntears of anger, grief or hurt, he could not have said.</p><p>&ldquo;Please,\nyour grace. You are angry and distressed. We should not continue our talk,\nbefore we are both calmer. I beg you to reconsider everything I&rsquo;ve done. I gave\nyou my word, we had an understanding.&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys\nopened her mouth, and Jon could see that she was about to lash out again, but they\nwere interrupted by a knock on the door. Davos entered immediately after\nknocking.</p><p>Jon was\nglad that he had dressed. He could see two Unsullied at the door, but they were\noutnumbered by a dozen men who wore the uniforms of the City Watch of King&rsquo;s\nLanding.</p><p>&ldquo;Your\ngrace.&rdquo; Davos bowed. &ldquo;I finally managed to get rooms fit for a king. I am sure,\nafter you and Queen Daenerys have discussed politics the whole morning, you\nneed rest.&rdquo; </p><p>Davos&rsquo; eyes\nwere pleading with him. He even went as far as extending a hand. Daenerys\nlooked from him to the two Unsullied and Jon could see her calculating if she\nshould give the order to seize them. The Unsullied were good fighters, but the\ncity watch outnumbered them. She let her hands fall to her side.</p><p>Jon nodded.\nHe put the letters he still held in his tunic and snatched at Longclaw.</p><p>He bowed\ndeeply to Daenerys. &ldquo;Your grace, I hope we can continue this talk another\ntime.&rdquo; Whatever good luck had brought Davos to him, he would not risk being\ndetained by an enraged queen.</p><p>Daenerys\ngave him a nod that was halfway between gracious and haughty. </p><p>&ldquo;We will\ncontinue our talk. Circumstances have changed, and I think we must renegotiate.\nIf you want my army and my dragons you will pay the price I name. I shall\nponder what that might be.&rdquo; </p><p>That was\nnot what Jon had hoped when he had entered her room yesterday. <i>How did it all go wrong? Why did she have to\nread my letters? Why did that damned Lannister look at the letters I was sent?</i></p><p>They left\nthe house in the midst of reassuring regular beating strides of the soldiers\nDavos had brought. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you\ntrust them?&rdquo; Jon whispered, gesturing at the guards. </p><p>&ldquo;These are\nGendry&rsquo;s men. They work against Queen Cersei.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why did\nyou come looking for me?&rdquo; he asked his Hand.</p><p>&ldquo;I wanted to\nensure your safety.&rdquo; Davos answered. </p><p>&ldquo;You did\nwell, but how did you know that things went awry? Not, that I complain.&rdquo; </p><p>Davos\nlooked at him with concern in his eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Did Queen Daenerys\nfind out? Was that, why she was shouting? I&rsquo;m sure you could have preferred to\nfind out in another way.&rdquo; He laid a hand on his arm.</p><p>Jon was\nconfused. &ldquo;Find out what? Daenerys was angry that Brienne killed her dragon&rdquo;.\nHe shook his head still wondering how Daenerys had not realised how dangerous the\nsituation with the dragons had been. &ldquo;and&hellip;.&rdquo; He could feel the blood creeping\nin his cheeks. &ldquo;She read my sisters&rsquo; letters. She misunderstood them. She\nthought, Sansa had ordered me to seduce her. Tyrion must have told her about\nthe planned alliance with the Vale.&rdquo;</p><p>Davos nodded.\n&ldquo;Unfortunately, there are ways to open a letter and leave the seal undamaged.\nIt is unfortunate, that Lord Tyrion found out about the planned alliance with\nthe Vale.&rdquo;</p><p>They were\nrounding a corner and approached a house at the docks, that Davos must have had\nchosen because it was close to the water. They could defend it with only a few\nmen.</p><p>&ldquo;But I was\ntalking about something else. It does not bode well, that you fell out with the\nqueen. You are in great danger, but we might keep things quiet and secret for\nnow.&rdquo; Davos said. Jon was at a loss what he meant.</p><p>When they\nentered the house, Davos ordered the men to secure the house from all corners.\nHis face was worried. Jon was worried as well. <i>What will Daenerys demand? Our whole trip North of the wall was for\nnothing. We don&rsquo;t get the Lannister army, I&rsquo;m stuck here, with only two dozen\nmen, most of them not my own, and Daenerys will make demands for an alliance,\njust because she thinks I&rsquo;m backed in a corner and her war does no go as she\nwants.</i></p><p>Davos led\nJon up the stairs. &ldquo;There is someone you have to see.&rdquo; </p><p>When Jon\nentered the small room on top of the stairs, he felt a rush of real joy. </p><p>&ldquo;Sam&rdquo;, he\ncried out and ran to hug his friend. </p><p>Sam hugged\nhim back, but soon stepped back. </p><p>&ldquo;How are\nyou, why are you here? Where is Gilly?&rdquo; Jon asked.</p><p>Sam didn&rsquo;t\nanswer anything, but looked at him with sad and earnest eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Jon, you\nhave to leave here as fast as possible. You are in great danger.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t\nbe the first time,&rdquo; Jon joked. &ldquo;What is it this time?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t\nthink you are safe anywhere near Daenerys Targaryen.&rdquo; Sam answered.</p><p>He shoved\nhis hair out of his face. Jon realised that he looked travel-worn and that he\nhad lost weight. </p><p>&ldquo;I came as\nfast as I could. You are in danger, because you are a threat to her claim.&rdquo; Sam\ncombed his hair nervously with his fingers. \n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know, how to tell you this&hellip;.&rdquo; </p><p>Sam somehow\nurged him to take a seat. Jon was puzzled. He had never seen his friend that\nfussing about. He obliged him and sat down. Sam sat beside him and looked at\nthe floor.</p><p>He made\nseveral attempts to start until he finally burst out: &ldquo;I was assigned to bring\norder to a letter collection from the mad king&rsquo;s reign. Tedious work, nobody\nhad ever looked at it, over 1000 letters.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There was\na letter by Arthur Dayne, the kingsguard, to his sister Ashara. It was written\nafter Rhaegar had fallen at the Trident and the Mad King had been murdered. He\nasked his sister if she would be willing to raise a child to save it from\nRobert&rsquo;s wrath. He wanted her to claim it was her son, hers and Brandon Starks,\nwhen it was Rhaegar&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon\nfrowned. &ldquo;Aegon, Rhaegar&rsquo;s son, was killed by the mountain in the sack of\nKing&rsquo;s Landing, everybody knows that.&rdquo; </p><p>Sam shook\nhis head &ldquo;Not that son. Rhaegar&rsquo;s and Lyanna&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon\nsuddenly felt dizzy.</p><p>&ldquo;What do\nyou want to say?&rdquo; But he didn&rsquo;t really need to be told. Somehow, he knew.</p><p>&ldquo;Lyanna had\na son. Arthur Dayne wanted to save the son of his prince. A son, he considered\nlegitimate, because Rhaegar had taken Lyanna as a second wife, like the\nTargaryens of old. The High Septon himself sanctified the marriage. Arthur\nknew, Lyanna was dying and that Ned Stark was on his way to the tower of joy.\nThat letter had been meant to go with the child once Ned Stark had been dealt\nwith.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon stared\nat Sam and willed him to stop, but his mind was blank, and words would not\ncome.</p><p>&ldquo;You know\nwhat happened. Ned Stark came to the Tower of Joy. Arthur Dayne and the\nkingsguards were killed. Ned found Lyanna dying or dead. &nbsp;He just never mentioned that she had died in\nchild bed.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon could\nhear his own ragged breath loudly in his ear. He shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Jon,&rdquo; Sam\nurged him to look at him. &ldquo;Ned Stark was your uncle. You&rsquo;re not his bastard.\nYou&rsquo;re Lyanna&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon shook\nhis head again.</p><p>Sam sighed.\n&ldquo;You know, if anybody had known that Lyanna was pregnant, I doubt I&rsquo;d be the\nonly one to come to the conclusion that Ned Stark hid you in plain sight.&rdquo; </p><p>Jon could\nfeel sweat breaking out on his forehead. <i>The\ndragon, Rhaegal&hellip;. I felt him&hellip;. Daenerys&hellip;. Rhaegar&rsquo;s sister&hellip;. My aunt&hellip;. Sansa&hellip;\nMy cousin, not my sister. I&rsquo;m a Targaryen. I&rsquo;m not a Stark, </i>His mind\nreeled, his thoughts spun. </p><p>Suddenly,\nthe wheel in his mind stopped, and he felt like his thoughts burst. He heard\nhimself laugh, a cackling laugh, that sounded so strange, or was he sobbing? He\nfelt his cheeks that were wet, and suddenly and violently he felt sick and vomited\nnoisily on the floor. </p>",

As someone said in the comments to my fic. The excrement is about to hit the airing device. Jon Snow wakes up to find an enraged Da&euro;nerys at his bedside. Also on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/8470255/chapters/36291405\">AO3</a>.</p>\n<p>Jon only\ngrabbed occasional bouts of sleep during the night, and when he slept his\ndreams were disturbed by strange feelings. He felt the loss of a brother that\nhad just died and anger at the human who had ordered him to fly high. He knew\nhe had escaped the dreadful sound of the horn, but he had also wanted to\neliminate the man who had dared to try to conquer him. When he felt his brother\ndie, he had wanted to revenge his brother, although he had no clear idea who\nhad killed him. Was it the man who had blown the horn? Was it one of the other\nant-like wraiths he had seen from far above? He didn&rsquo;t know. <br /></p>\n</p>",
