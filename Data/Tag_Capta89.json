He doesn&rsquo;t say <i>who</i> is calling him that, but this tells us that it isn&rsquo;t normal for modern Kree to be this brutal. The only other Kree he&rsquo;s seen interacting with is Korath, and he has to beg for help from Thanos so he can&rsquo;t have a lot of support.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0a8ac4d6e22a3c415c97feaa992561c1/tumblr_pp8vefJPWg1rkhmic_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>In Agents of Shield some Kree scientists preformed experiments on humans, but those experiments were illegal so the Kree Empire shut that shit down real fast once they found out about it. We also saw in the series that if a Kree has no beef with you or your people they can be downright polite and pleasant company. It just so happens they usually have beef with people when they leave Hala. There&rsquo;s evidence to suggest they aren&rsquo;t even aggressive by nature because if they are put through a heavy dose of their own memory wiping techniques they become remarkably docile and friendly (depending on their individual personalities of course) We&rsquo;re also told they have positive qualities too, like free love, but because they&rsquo;re so unpopular thanks to their warmongering other races tend to be dismissive of Kree culture as a whole.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e5dcca8147f57f51d241bd951b8f41f2/tumblr_pp8vegikU81rkhmic_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>In Captain Marvel we see a rather wide range of sides. </p><p>There&rsquo;s Ronan who wants to carpet bomb everything with little regard for the lives of other races. </p><p>At the other end of the spectrum is Mar-Vell who is a pacifist and tries to end the war on the Skrulls. </p><p>In the middle is Yon-Rogg who is shown to want to kill Skrulls because they have been deemed the enemies of the Kree, but he is also shown to have compassion for other races when he tells his team not to kill the locals during their first mission, even though the locals are clearly aggressive and hostile. It almost gets his team killed and Carol is captured because Yon-Rogg refuse to open fire until he realize the locals are Skrull soldiers in disguise. Later he tells Ronan to chill and maybe NOT carpet bomb Earth and kill millions of innocent people to flush out Carol. Just a thought. He later change his mind when Carol realize her true potential because they&rsquo;re all going to die anyway if Carol comes after them.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/471644199b63455adc5c34e1ec1b67a2/tumblr_pp8veg5uOZ1rkhmic_640.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>(This is part of why I think he will probably get a redemption arc.
