This means Caleb and Nott have been the Mighty Nein for almost the same amount of time as the two had known each other prior to meeting the others (so a full year for these too). I say this because we know how close these two were before the campaign even started and how they would drop everything to protect each other. And as much as I would have loved to see that development, it\u2019s really neat seeing this loyalty and care across the entire group naturally flourish over the course of these six months with the Mighty Nein.</p><p>It makes me wonder if campaign 2 started now (a la campaign 1 style) instead of level 2 where we first met them, how differently would we view their varied and complicated relationships without the knowledge of what they had all suffered together?\u00a0</p>",
