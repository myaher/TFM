I was about to finish their uniforms, but that will need to wait. Well, here it is!</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1a055872b4b2ff8f1bae10d8fcde8fd0/tumblr_inline_phxtqnM9PS1vz9kls_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>\n\nTo be precise, I&rsquo;m listing them:<br />- Midoriya, Bakugo, Todoroki, Kaminari, Kirishima and All-Might, as we already had (Sadly, there&rsquo;s no model of the &ldquo;other&rdquo; All-might in this game). All of them look quite well and better than before, but Kaminari&rsquo;s one looks a bit weird.<br />- <b>Iida</b>, Ochaco, Tsuyu, Jiro, Momo and Shigaraki (Ups, I forgot to add him to this picture, he&rsquo;s in the next one) in a new version as well. I could have converted them before, but I didn&rsquo;t have time. (They look nice too)<br />- <b>Dabi</b>, Aizawa, Toga, All for One (Helmet) and Inasa coming brand new! They weren&rsquo;t in the previous game so this new one is giving us the chance to convert them.<br /><br />But that&rsquo;s not all!<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/52887631dee414a94c336a4d9ffb8815/tumblr_inline_phxttnBINY1vz9kls_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>(Here&rsquo;s Tomura) Now, some special ones: Tokoyami is joining us too! Even if it sounds impossible, it wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time I do something like that. If you already know my content, you know what I mean. I&rsquo;ll try to rig it and make his mouth and eyes move, but I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;ll be able to get it. Anyways, just the head would be enough. Stain and Muscular are possible to convert too, but I&rsquo;m not sure if anyone&rsquo;s interested in them so I&rsquo;m not converting them until someone requests them. And the same goes for Endeavor, but adding that his texture is shit and even if I retexture it it will remain looking pretty weird. And, yes, Gran Torino&hellip; with this BIG guy we have two chances: making him a child with his looking (but acting like a child, requesting for betdime stories, going to school and having the voice of a 10 years old child) or making him an elder with the height of any other sim. You decide.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/05b17ccdd9832cdbd1e3f5ab51ea0be0/tumblr_inline_phxuao9Hac1vz9kls_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Here you have a nearer view of some of them. I bet you&rsquo;re going to like them really much! (You can open the picture in a new tab to see it better) Also there are a few items in the game that I&rsquo;ll try to extract, like Ojiro&rsquo;s tail, Overhaul&rsquo;s mask, Kota&rsquo;s hat and more. I&rsquo;ll list them soon and wait for you to request them. </p><p>And finally, I&rsquo;d like to know which one you like the most or you&rsquo;re more excited about and to set an order for converting them based on it, so <strike>I&rsquo;m posting soon</strike>&nbsp;<b>I&rsquo;ve already posted</b> a poll where I&rsquo;d like you to vote for the one you want first.
