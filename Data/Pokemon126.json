Currently obsessed with the Predator series and anything Yautja related. Some of my favorite game series at the moment include Pokemon, Fallout, Dark Souls, Kirby and Warframe. Expect loads of pointless memes reblogged from my favorite blogs. I also do art sometimes! It's all tagged under #dingusdoodles",

It's a rumor from 2014 and the rumor mentions the Nintendo Switch before it was revealed (not by the Switch name, but it speaks of a new Pokemon game on a handheld-home console hybrid). Also, Pokemon has featured Plusle and Minun in two Twitter posts. James Turner's New Year's art on Twitter featured 2018 in Sun and Moon's color scheme and 2019 in green and pink (maybe green for plus? pink for minus?).",

But I had totally forgotten about it, since the last I heard about it was before I made this blog, and a lot of what I had seen as \u201cproofs of the rumor being true\u201d from other users were a bit unconvincing.

                "content": "<p>\n\n<i>&ldquo;The arrival of POPPLIO and its evolutionary line can be traced far back into kroels history, as records show their introduction to popular shows held in the great theaters and aquariums of ancient civilizations, used for mere entertaintment rather than battle, countless murals, tile mosaics and frescos found in ancient fountains and public plazas stll show the playful figures of this pokemon dancing and singing for the peoples enjoyment. However, when this pokemon was introduced to the wild as many tried to make its population grow in native waters rather than traveling to far islands to capture them, proved to be not as easily. Kroel tropical oceans, being populated by large predators as GLOTONINA and JORMUGRAND was no place for the merry seal pokemon, who, in order to survive, traveled and made its home in the northern, colder waters of Kroel. In a more harsh enviroment, populated by strong pokemon on its own, the once happy-going species underwant a very extreme change to adapt to such harsh conditions, by growing a thic coat of fur and a more aggressive nature, becoming powerful predators on their own.
