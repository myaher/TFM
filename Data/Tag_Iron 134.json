\u00a0He was about to open his mouth to ask, but\nPeter suddenly stood up and held a hand out for Tony to take.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Peter\nsaid. \u00a0\u201cI want to take you somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Tony took Peter\u2019s\nhand and followed him out of the restaurant. \nThey walked for a while in comfortable silence, and then Tony realised\nhe hadn\u2019t thanked Peter for the meal. \u00a0<i>Idiot</i>, he berated himself.</p><p>\u201cThanks so much for\nthe meal, baby,\u201d Tony said, wrapping an arm around Peter\u2019s waist as they\nwalked. \u00a0It was cold out, and Peter leaned\ninto Tony\u2019s touch. </p><p>\u201cDid you like it?\u201d\nPeter asked, glancing up at Tony with a curious look in his soft brown eyes.</p><p>Tony held Peter\ncloser to him and smiled. \u00a0\u201cI loved it.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s smile grew,\nand with that Tony stopped, stepping in front of Peter and wrapping his other\narm around the younger man\u2019s waist.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you\nstopping?\u201d Peter asked, shivering slightly at the cold. \u00a0It was just beginning to snow, and Tony couldn\u2019t\nask for better timing if he tried.</p><p>\u201cYou smiled and I-\u201d\nTony started, lifting a hand up to caress Peter\u2019s cheek softly. \u00a0\u201c-I needed to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>Peter only smiled\nmore. \u00a0\u201cSo what are you waiting for?\u201d</p><p>Tony closed the gap\nbetween them with a slow, tender kiss. \nPeter sighed contently against Tony\u2019s lips and pushed himself closer to\nTony, wrapping both his arms around his neck. \nTony deepened the kiss, wishing it could last forever. \u00a0This moment was perfect. \u00a0God, he loved Peter \u2013 more than\nanything. \u00a0Their bodies were pressed\ntogether, fingers tangled in each other\u2019s hair, lips crashing together now in a\ndesperate need to feel only each other.</p><p>When they\neventually broke apart for air, they stayed only inches apart, foreheads\npressed together. \u00a0Peter exhaled, the\ncold making his breath visible between them. \nThey stared at each other, getting lost in each other\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cPeter, I-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-Marry me,\u201d Peter\nwhispered, not taking his eyes off Tony\u2019s. \n\u201cPlease, <i>please</i> marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI- for real?\u201d Tony\nasked, holding onto Peter more tightly. \nHe couldn\u2019t believe what was happening. \nHe really hadn\u2019t expected that. \u00a0Was\nPeter really proposing to him? \u00a0It\nfit. \u00a0The fancy restaurant, Valentine\u2019s\nDay, the nervousness\u2026 </p><p>\u201cFor real, I- I got\nyou a ring, um, hold on,\u201d Peter stammered, releasing one of his hands from\naround Tony\u2019s neck and fumbling around in his jacket pocket for something. \u00a0He brought his other hand down and then\ncarefully got down on one knee. \u00a0\u201cLet me\ndo this right, okay?\u201d</p><p>Tony blinked down at\nhim, but he couldn\u2019t find the words. \u00a0He\nnodded, unable to keep the smile from his face.</p><p>Peter shakily brought\nthe box up and opened it, revealing a beautiful ring that was exactly to Tony\u2019s\ntaste. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t too over-the-top, not\ngirly, not even too plain. \u00a0It was just <i>perfect</i>, and it definitely wasn\u2019t\ncheap. \u00a0Tony knew a lot about jewellery,\nand this was the real deal.</p><p>\u201cTony, you\u2019re the\nbest thing that\u2019s ever happened to me. \nYou make me smile when I\u2019m feeling at my worst, and you make me laugh\nwhen I just want to curl up and cry. \u00a0You\nbring light to my life, and you make me happy to be alive. \u00a0I, uh, well\u2026 I actually had a whole speech\nprepared and I\u2019ve totally forgotten it so\u2026 there goes that,\u201d Peter said, laughing\nnervously.

\u00a0He was about to open his mouth to ask, but\nPeter suddenly stood up and held a hand out for Tony to take.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Peter\nsaid. \u00a0\u201cI want to take you somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Tony took Peter\u2019s\nhand and followed him out of the restaurant. \nThey walked for a while in comfortable silence, and then Tony realised\nhe hadn\u2019t thanked Peter for the meal. \u00a0<i>Idiot</i>, he berated himself.</p><p>\u201cThanks so much for\nthe meal, baby,\u201d Tony said, wrapping an arm around Peter\u2019s waist as they\nwalked. \u00a0It was cold out, and Peter leaned\ninto Tony\u2019s touch. </p><p>\u201cDid you like it?\u201d\nPeter asked, glancing up at Tony with a curious look in his soft brown eyes.</p><p>Tony held Peter\ncloser to him and smiled. \u00a0\u201cI loved it.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s smile grew,\nand with that Tony stopped, stepping in front of Peter and wrapping his other\narm around the younger man\u2019s waist.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you\nstopping?\u201d Peter asked, shivering slightly at the cold. \u00a0It was just beginning to snow, and Tony couldn\u2019t\nask for better timing if he tried.</p><p>\u201cYou smiled and I-\u201d\nTony started, lifting a hand up to caress Peter\u2019s cheek softly. \u00a0\u201c-I needed to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>Peter only smiled\nmore. \u00a0\u201cSo what are you waiting for?\u201d</p><p>Tony closed the gap\nbetween them with a slow, tender kiss. \nPeter sighed contently against Tony\u2019s lips and pushed himself closer to\nTony, wrapping both his arms around his neck. \nTony deepened the kiss, wishing it could last forever. \u00a0This moment was perfect. \u00a0God, he loved Peter \u2013 more than\nanything. \u00a0Their bodies were pressed\ntogether, fingers tangled in each other\u2019s hair, lips crashing together now in a\ndesperate need to feel only each other.</p><p>When they\neventually broke apart for air, they stayed only inches apart, foreheads\npressed together. \u00a0Peter exhaled, the\ncold making his breath visible between them. \nThey stared at each other, getting lost in each other\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cPeter, I-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-Marry me,\u201d Peter\nwhispered, not taking his eyes off Tony\u2019s. \n\u201cPlease, <i>please</i> marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI- for real?\u201d Tony\nasked, holding onto Peter more tightly. \nHe couldn\u2019t believe what was happening. \nHe really hadn\u2019t expected that. \u00a0Was\nPeter really proposing to him? \u00a0It\nfit. \u00a0The fancy restaurant, Valentine\u2019s\nDay, the nervousness\u2026 </p><p>\u201cFor real, I- I got\nyou a ring, um, hold on,\u201d Peter stammered, releasing one of his hands from\naround Tony\u2019s neck and fumbling around in his jacket pocket for something. \u00a0He brought his other hand down and then\ncarefully got down on one knee. \u00a0\u201cLet me\ndo this right, okay?\u201d</p><p>Tony blinked down at\nhim, but he couldn\u2019t find the words. \u00a0He\nnodded, unable to keep the smile from his face.</p><p>Peter shakily brought\nthe box up and opened it, revealing a beautiful ring that was exactly to Tony\u2019s\ntaste. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t too over-the-top, not\ngirly, not even too plain. \u00a0It was just <i>perfect</i>, and it definitely wasn\u2019t\ncheap. \u00a0Tony knew a lot about jewellery,\nand this was the real deal.</p><p>\u201cTony, you\u2019re the\nbest thing that\u2019s ever happened to me. \nYou make me smile when I\u2019m feeling at my worst, and you make me laugh\nwhen I just want to curl up and cry. \u00a0You\nbring light to my life, and you make me happy to be alive. \u00a0I, uh, well\u2026 I actually had a whole speech\nprepared and I\u2019ve totally forgotten it so\u2026 there goes that,\u201d Peter said, laughing\nnervously. Tony brought his hands out to steady Peter\u2019s shaky hands. \u00a0\u201cBut what I\u2019m really trying to ask you is\u2026\nwell\u2026 Tony Stark, will you marry me?\u201d</p><p>For a split second,\nTony thought he\u2019d mess with Peter and say something stupid, but the look in\nPeter\u2019s eyes made it impossible. \u00a0How\ncould he say anything other than \u2018yes\u2019 to the pure, beautiful angel that was\nkneeling before him asking him to be his forever? \u00a0Tony grinned down at him. \u00a0\u201cOf course I\u2019ll marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will?!\u201d Peter\nasked, getting up quickly, looking utterly relieved. </p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Tony\nrepeated, holding his hand out expectantly.</p><p>Peter made an\nexcited sound and pulled the ring out of the box, slowly sliding it onto Tony\u2019s\nleft ring-finger.</p><p>\u201cIt suits you,\u201d\nPeter said, admiring the ring on Tony\u2019s hand and then staring up at his face\nwith adoration. \u201cWe\u2019re getting <i>married</i>!\u201d</p><p>Tony pulled Peter\ncloser and kissed the top of his forehead. \n\u201cHow\u2019d you afford all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been saving\nfor years,\u201d Peter said quietly, resting his head against Tony\u2019s chest. \u00a0\u201cAll the money I could save, I put it away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to\ndo this-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-Tony, I know\nthat,\u201d Peter said, holding onto him tighter. \n\u201cBut I <i>wanted</i> to.\u201d</p><p>Tony kissed the top\nof his head. \u00a0\u201cI love you, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d\nPeter said with a smile. \u00a0</p><p>And so, Valentine\u2019s\nDay was now Tony\u2019s favourite holiday.</p>",

&nbsp;He was about to open his mouth to ask, but\nPeter suddenly stood up and held a hand out for Tony to take.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; Peter\nsaid. &nbsp;&ldquo;I want to take you somewhere.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony took Peter&rsquo;s\nhand and followed him out of the restaurant. \nThey walked for a while in comfortable silence, and then Tony realised\nhe hadn&rsquo;t thanked Peter for the meal. &nbsp;<i>Idiot</i>, he berated himself.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks so much for\nthe meal, baby,&rdquo; Tony said, wrapping an arm around Peter&rsquo;s waist as they\nwalked. &nbsp;It was cold out, and Peter leaned\ninto Tony&rsquo;s touch. </p><p>&ldquo;Did you like it?&rdquo;\nPeter asked, glancing up at Tony with a curious look in his soft brown eyes.</p><p>Tony held Peter\ncloser to him and smiled. &nbsp;&ldquo;I loved it.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s smile grew,\nand with that Tony stopped, stepping in front of Peter and wrapping his other\narm around the younger man&rsquo;s waist.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you\nstopping?&rdquo; Peter asked, shivering slightly at the cold. &nbsp;It was just beginning to snow, and Tony couldn&rsquo;t\nask for better timing if he tried.</p><p>&ldquo;You smiled and I-&rdquo;\nTony started, lifting a hand up to caress Peter&rsquo;s cheek softly. &nbsp;&ldquo;-I needed to kiss you.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter only smiled\nmore. &nbsp;&ldquo;So what are you waiting for?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony closed the gap\nbetween them with a slow, tender kiss. \nPeter sighed contently against Tony&rsquo;s lips and pushed himself closer to\nTony, wrapping both his arms around his neck. \nTony deepened the kiss, wishing it could last forever. &nbsp;This moment was perfect. &nbsp;God, he loved Peter &ndash; more than\nanything. &nbsp;Their bodies were pressed\ntogether, fingers tangled in each other&rsquo;s hair, lips crashing together now in a\ndesperate need to feel only each other.</p><p>When they\neventually broke apart for air, they stayed only inches apart, foreheads\npressed together. &nbsp;Peter exhaled, the\ncold making his breath visible between them. \nThey stared at each other, getting lost in each other&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, I-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;-Marry me,&rdquo; Peter\nwhispered, not taking his eyes off Tony&rsquo;s. \n&ldquo;Please, <i>please</i> marry me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I- for real?&rdquo; Tony\nasked, holding onto Peter more tightly. \nHe couldn&rsquo;t believe what was happening. \nHe really hadn&rsquo;t expected that. &nbsp;Was\nPeter really proposing to him?

He looked at the TV, too, now and pretended not to watch Clint out of the corner of his eyes. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go to bed,\u201d Clint said after half an hour of forced silence. He put his mug on the coffee table and went to the door when Steve turned to him. </p><p>\u201cYou know you can talk to us, right?\u201d </p><p>Clint stopped, deliberated for a moment, then nodded. </p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just\u2026 it was just a rough mission. I\u2019m okay, okay?\u201d </p><p>Steve nodded, too. </p><p>Clint went back to his room. He really wanted to be alone right now. But when he opened his door he sensed another presence. </p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d he said. He knew that it was him, he always knew when he was close. </p><p>\u201cWell, you didn\u2019t tell me you\u2019re back,\u201d Tony said. He sat on Clint\u2019s bed, his ankles crossed, and looked at his phone.

He closed the distance between the two of them and scrutinized him. </p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Tony asked and Clint sighed. </p><p>\u201cYou, too?\u201d </p><p>Tony took his hand and saw the bandages, touched it carefully with one finger and looked up at Clint. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2026 it was a rough mission,\u201d Clint said slowly. </p><p>\u201cI was worried,\u201d Tony said, his voice rough. \u201cYou\u2019ve been away for almost two weeks and\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy does everyone think I can\u2019t do my damn job?\u201d Clint snapped now and pulled back his hand. \u201cYes, I got captured and yes, I got injured but it\u2019s nothing serious! I\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cClint, no one said you can\u2019t do your job,\u201d Tony said calmly. \u201cI know you can do your job and the rest of the team knows, too.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen why\u2026\u201d Clint started but Tony stopped him. </p><p>\u201cBecause maybe we <i>like </i>you!\u201d He snapped. \u201cAnd\u2026 I <i>always </i>worry about you!

Tony nodded and closed the distance between them, wrapped his arms around him and kissed his cheek. </p><p>\u201cCome on, baby,\u201d he said then. \u201cYou need to sleep.\u201d He led him to the bed and sat down with him. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Clint frowned. </p><p>\u201cSleeping,\u201d Tony said and smiled. \u201cI want to make sure you actually stay in bed.\u201d He waggled his brows now. </p><p>\u201cI love you, Tony,\u201d Clint said and leaned in to kissed Tony. </p><p>\u201cI love you, too.

He stole some scrubs out of a locker, borrowed one of the SUVs from the car pool and drove to the Avengers HQ, sneaked in his apartment and threw the scrubs in the bin. </p><p>He undid all the bandages and went to the shower. He knew he shouldn\u2019t do that, but he needed to be clean again. Of course the nurses had cleaned him when Coulson had brought him in but he didn\u2019t <i>feel </i>clean. He felt like shit and he needed to get rid of that feeling. </p><p>The water was hot and he sighed when it hit his sore body. One of the benefits of the Avengers HQ was an apparently infinite supply of hot water. In SHIELD HQ the hot water stopped after four minutes, only god - and maybe Fury - knew why. </p><p>When his skin was wrinkly he stepped out of the shower, toweled himself and put the bandages back on. He could cover them with his clothes so the others wouldn\u2019t ask dumb questions. He hated it when they always asked him what happened. It was his damn job and he didn\u2019t want to have to explain himself all the time. </p><p>Clint put on some sweats and a long sleeved hoodie. It was comfortable, purple and covered the bandages on his wrists where the cuffs had cut into his flesh. Perfect. He shuffled to his kitchenette, opened the cupboard and cursed. No coffee. Damn. He had to go to the communal kitchen to get his fix. </p><p>\u201cHey, Clint,\u201d someone said and Clint sighed inwardly. Of course he wasn\u2019t alone. Nat sat at the table, a book in her hand and a cup of tea on the table. \u201cSince when are you back?\u201d </p><p>He looked at the clock on the wall. </p><p>\u201cAn hour,\u201d he said, \u201cand a few minutes.\u201d He shuffled to the coffee maker, took his mug out of the cupboard and started the machine. Seconds later the awesome aroma of hot coffee wafted through the kitchen and he almost whined. He hadn\u2019t had coffee for almost two weeks and he couldn\u2019t wait to get his first sip. </p><p>Natasha watched him and Clint saw her looking at his hands and then back at him. </p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked and Clint nodded. He pulled the sleeves back over the tiny bit of bandage showing. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been\u2026 rough,\u201d he said. But when she opened her mouth he took his mug and left the kitchen. He sighed and went to the living room. Fortunately it was empty and so he put the mug onto the table, reached for the remote and switched on the TV. He leaned back into the cushions, cradled the mug with one hand and zapped through the channels. </p><p>\u201cHey, Clint,\u201d he heard a voice from the doorway and couldn\u2019t help himself, he had to roll his eyes. Steve came over to him and sat down in the armchair. Clint put the remote down and held the mug with both hands, carefully checking the bandages were covered. </p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said and looked at Steve. \u201cSomething up?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Steve said and Clint saw that he lied. \u201cI mean,\u201d he said a moment later, \u201care you okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI just came back from a mission,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m tired and I just want to sit here and drink my coffee.\u201d </p><p>Steve\u2019s eyes flicked to his wrists, too, and he licked his lips. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Clint said before Steve could say more. \u201cTired and sore, but okay.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Steve eventually said and leaned back. He looked at the TV, too, now and pretended not to watch Clint out of the corner of his eyes. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go to bed,\u201d Clint said after half an hour of forced silence. He put his mug on the coffee table and went to the door when Steve turned to him. </p><p>\u201cYou know you can talk to us, right?\u201d </p><p>Clint stopped, deliberated for a moment, then nodded. </p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just\u2026 it was just a rough mission. I\u2019m okay, okay?\u201d </p><p>Steve nodded, too. </p><p>Clint went back to his room. He really wanted to be alone right now. But when he opened his door he sensed another presence. </p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d he said. He knew that it was him, he always knew when he was close. </p><p>\u201cWell, you didn\u2019t tell me you\u2019re back,\u201d Tony said. He sat on Clint\u2019s bed, his ankles crossed, and looked at his phone. But when Clint came closer he put the phone away and looked up. \u201cNat called me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I wanted to call you, but\u2026\u201d he stopped and licked his lips nervously. \u201cBut I\u2026 I was tired and\u2026\u201d</p><p>Tony swung his feet to the ground and rose. He closed the distance between the two of them and scrutinized him. </p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Tony asked and Clint sighed. </p><p>\u201cYou, too?\u201d </p><p>Tony took his hand and saw the bandages, touched it carefully with one finger and looked up at Clint. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2026 it was a rough mission,\u201d Clint said slowly. </p><p>\u201cI was worried,\u201d Tony said, his voice rough. \u201cYou\u2019ve been away for almost two weeks and\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy does everyone think I can\u2019t do my damn job?\u201d Clint snapped now and pulled back his hand. \u201cYes, I got captured and yes, I got injured but it\u2019s nothing serious! I\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cClint, no one said you can\u2019t do your job,\u201d Tony said calmly. \u201cI know you can do your job and the rest of the team knows, too.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen why\u2026\u201d Clint started but Tony stopped him. </p><p>\u201cBecause maybe we <i>like </i>you!\u201d He snapped. \u201cAnd\u2026 I <i>always </i>worry about you! I love you, asshat!\u201d </p><p>Clint cast his eyes down and took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Tony,\u201d he said. Tony nodded and closed the distance between them, wrapped his arms around him and kissed his cheek. </p><p>\u201cCome on, baby,\u201d he said then. \u201cYou need to sleep.\u201d He led him to the bed and sat down with him. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Clint frowned. </p><p>\u201cSleeping,\u201d Tony said and smiled. \u201cI want to make sure you actually stay in bed.\u201d He waggled his brows now. </p><p>\u201cI love you, Tony,\u201d Clint said and leaned in to kissed Tony. </p><p>\u201cI love you, too. And now\u2026 sleep.\u201d </p></p>",
