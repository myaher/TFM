He just can\u2019t believe in system the dictates the direction of his life before he even has a say in the matter. The timer on Dan\u2019s arm counts down to the second that Dan will meet his soulmate, and despite his utter reluctance and dread for the moment to come, he almost finds himself happy it does. He might not have imagined it would happen the way it does, but he just can\u2019t help but feel something for the mysterious man named Philip Lester. And that\u2019s a major problem.<br/></p><p><b>Soulmates AU</b></p><p><a href=\"https://embracedthevoid.tumblr.com/post/182797137139/everylittlethingch3\" target=\"_blank\">Read Chapter Three</a></p><p><b>Word Count:</b> 6.7k <b>Chapter:</b> 3/? <b>Rating:</b> T</p><p><b>a/n: </b>As per usual I have to thank <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRIDDPkl1a7wWNj29b8okpQ\" target=\"_blank\">@imnotinclinedtomaturity</a> for being an amazing beta.

When he peeks his head around, he can see Phil sat at his usual spot through the smudged glass window and his heart begins pounding.</p><!-- more --><p>Beside his computer, Phil has his notebook open in front of him. He leans forward to scribble something onto the paper, making his glasses fall to the bridge of his nose. He pushes them back into place, and then runs his hands through his quiff, forcing it slightly askew. He\u2019s concentrating  so hard on his work that lines on his forehead have started indent his skin.\u00a0<br/></p><p>He looks <i>so</i> serious.\u00a0</p><p>Dan imagines Phil looking at him like <i>that</i>, over his glasses with the stern look he has right now. Perhaps Phil\u2019s blue eyes would darken to something deeper, the thought only makes Dan mind wander</p><p>Dan pictures them alone in his flat with a finished bottle of wine, which was shared between the two of them, abandoned on the coffee table. Dan would bite his lip, the liquid courage making things easier; he\u2019d lean forward on the couch inching closer to Phil, feeling Phil\u2019s breath light on his skin because they\u2019re so close. Dan\u2019s hands find their way onto the denim material covering Phil\u2019s thigh, they slide up as their lips touch and\u2013</p><p>Someone sneezes as they walk past Dan, yanking him out of his daydream.</p><p>Swallowing down his desire, Dan tries to focus on Phil and actually muster up the courage to talk to the man. But Dan falters when he sees Phil open his phone and snap a picture of his coffee cup. Dan watches him review the photo then move the cup slightly to take another photo. This time he seems pleased; the corner of his mouth turns up slightly as he tilts his head to the side. His fingers tap away at the screen and Dan\u2019s chest flutters.</p><p>How can Phil go from making Dan want to rip his clothes off, to an adorable dork that he wants to hug, in just seconds?</p><p>It\u2019s <i>completely</i> unfair.</p><p>Dan\u2019s phone buzzes in his pocket. He pulls it out and unlocks it to see that Phil Lester has posted to his Instagram story. Dan chuckles to himself, knowing the process that lead to the notification, and how adorable Phil is. Dan taps on the circle, opening the story to reveal a picture of Phil\u2019s coffee with multiple flashy stickers surrounding it. At the bottom, the image reads \u2018Wow! Sarah, the magical barista put Pikachu in my cup!\u2019. And of course, there is an adorable Pikachu made in the froth of Phil\u2019s caramel macchiato, which dan can only assume is what Phil is drinking.</p><p>Dan squeezes his phone a little too tight. An ugly surge of jealousy knots in his stomach, same as the day he walked in on Phil and the barista \u2013 who Dan now knows is Sarah \u2013 giggling together. He\u2019s not sure what came over him that day, he\u2019d been working so hard on feeling indifferent to the whole <i>Phil and soulmates situation</i>. But when he saw them together, Dan snapped. He wasn\u2019t sure if they\u2019d been flirting or not, but even the idea makes Dan nauseous.</p><p>Groaning, Dan leans away from the window, resting against the side of the building. He shouldn\u2019t care. </p><p>But he <i>does</i>.</p><p>Of course Dan had to complicate things further when he actually sat down with Phil the last time he saw him. Sure, it wasn\u2019t as terribly awkward as Dan imagined, but he almost wished it had been. Then maybe he\u2019d be able to say with confidence that the universe got it wrong, and that they\u2019re completely opposite people and <i>nothing</i> alike.</p><p>Except, that they have<i> everything</i> in common \u2014 Dan knows from just watching Phil&rsquo;s videos over the years that they\u2019re perfect for each other. Hell, Dan doesn\u2019t remember a time when he didn\u2019t think they\u2019d get on well if they knew each other in real life.</p><p>Still, the things Phil shares on his channel are all superficial. Dan has yet to spend any actual time with Phil. He only knows the Phil that he portrays through his social media, Dan doesn\u2019t know the hidden version of Phil. Maybe that\u2019s where they\u2019ll clash. Aside from their small conversation yesterday, Phil only knows the persona Dan has assumed through his own youtube channel. Yesterday Dan was being himself, but the situation was still tense. Maybe once Phil gets to know who Dan really is, he won\u2019t be so eager when Dan walks through the door.</p><p>There\u2019s movement at Phil\u2019s table, grabbing Dan\u2019s attention. That <i>Sarah</i> girl is leaning against the back of the chair across from Phil. She says something to make Phil laugh, and Dan quickly reminded of how much this girl gets under his skin.</p><p>Dan imagines the annoyingly pretty girl sitting down, and Phil looking at <i>her </i>over his glasses in in that dreamy way. It\u2019s enough to agitate Dan further.</p><p>Dan\u2019s fists tighten at his sides and, without thinking, he marches straight to the shop\u2019s front door and yanks it open. <i>He</i> wants to be the one making Phil laugh, not some girl who probably just wants his attention because he\u2019s famous.</p><p>Determined not to look like blubbering idiot, Dan walks directly toward Phil, probably coming across more aggressive than confident. Phil spots Dan immediately and seems to say something to Sarah. She looks over her shoulder and Dan can see recognition dawn in her eyes before she quickly bolts away from Phil\u2019s table.</p><p>He really does <i>try </i>to not glare at her, but&hellip; sometimes his jealousy gets the best of him.</p><p>When Dan makes it to Phil\u2019s table, he realizes how stupid he is. He\u2019s enough of an idiot to walk into the building without a plan. Dan opens his mouth, but nothing comes out. What is he supposed to say? Why didn\u2019t he think this through? </p><p>It doesn\u2019t help with the way that Phil\u2019s looking at him; his eyes are an intense shade of blue. They\u2019re nothing like Dan\u2019s ever seen before, so sharp and daunting as he stares as Dan with his jaw slightly agape. Dan shutters slightly remembering his daydream from earlier \u2014 having him acting look at him like that sends a spark though Dan\u2019s chest. </p><p>Feeling suddenly <i>very</i> aware of his entire body, Dan focuses hard on not doing something completely embarrassing. He points to the chair, silently asking to sit. That was a completely natural and reasonable thing to do, right?</p><p>\u201cUh- oh yeah! Sit please!\u201d Phil almost shouts, eagerly moving his things aside, making room. Phil keenly smiles at Dan as his cheeks turn a light shade of red \u2013 he watches intently as Dan moves to sit. And Dan is thankful for the seat, because being around a slightly flustered Phil is enough to make Dan weak in the knees. Dan tries to relax but fails miserably \u2013 He can\u2019t help the way he holds his shoulders stiff as fidgets with the ripped material of his black jeans.  </p><p>\u201cYou seem-\u201d Dan\u2019s voice cracks slightly. He licks his lips, trying desperately not to feel flustered. He can\u2019t help it, though. Phil Lester is sitting across from him; how could he not be internally freaking out? Dan always imagined what conversations with Phil would be like, he practically rehearsed them daily, but now Dan\u2019s head is a jumbled mess.</p><p>Dan clears his throat. \u201cYou seem busy.\u201d He doesn\u2019t sound any more confident as he croaks, his words sounding like he desperately needs a glass of water.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working on my next video,\u201d Phil explains looking at his notebook. \u201cStill haven\u2019t quite figured it out yet,\u201d he mumbles, scratching his head. Dan\u2019s follows the movement, and his heart melts. From a distance, Phil had looked absolutely breathtaking, and up close \u2014 well, that\u2019s something Dan doesn\u2019t even know where to start and explain.</p><p>Dan never thought someone&rsquo;s skin could look so soft. He wants to reach out and trail the pads of his fingers over Phil\u2019s cheeks. Dan wants to feel every inch of Phil with his fingers, over the bridge of his nose, his smile lines, his lips. God his <i>lips</i>. They look so smooth \u2013 would they feel that way against Dan\u2019s own cracked and stress bitten ones? Would their kiss be as warm and soothing as Dan feels when Phil simply smiles at him?</p><p>Phil clears his throat and Dan realizes he\u2019s been staring. </p><p>Great, forget trying to seem confident, he\u2019s just gone straight to creepy.</p><p>\u201cIs it the same from yesterday, the Q and A? Any new ideas for it?\u201d Dan asks genuinely interested. His voice is shaky, and he tries not to let his cheeks become too flushed with embarrassment. His attempts are pointless, of course. Dan feels his cheeks warm as they turn to a rosy colour.</p><p>As much as Dan would love to marvel at how gorgeous Phil is, he needs something else to focus on because, unfortunately staring endlessly at Phil, being memorised by his smile, face, hair, and entire existence isn\u2019t the socially acceptable thing to do. Besides, Dan is still a massive fan of Phil\u2019s channel, getting the inside scoop of his next video is still a welcome distraction from the daydreaming about the gorgeous man. Though it\u2019s far less scandalous, it\u2019s still satisfying to hear about. </p><p>\u201cA few,\u201d Phil says, not sounding too confident in them.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me if you don\u2019t want to, but maybe you could bounce some ideas off me? Sometimes it helps to have another person&rsquo;s opinion,\u201d Dan offers. He knows what it\u2019s like to share an idea that\u2019s not completely ready, and he hates it. But Dan also knows what it\u2019s like to feel trapped in your head about something \u2014 a fresh pair of eyes really does help.</p><p>Phil takes a moment to look at his notebook \u2013 which he holds close out of Dan\u2019s sight \u2013 then at Dan. He eyes Dan with a smirk on his lips. \u201cHow do I know you won\u2019t go steal my ideas?\u201d </p><p>He\u2019s clearly joking but Dan can understand where Phil\u2019s coming from. It\u2019s not a serious question, but at the same time, it is. It\u2019s hard to trust people in the youtube industry these days.</p><p>\u201cMy lips are sealed\u201d Dan winks, \u201cand I\u2019ll tell you the plans for my next video in return.\u201d He wants to retract the arrangement he as soon as he offers it, but it\u2019s too late. When he\u2019s with Phil, he completely loses his natural filter and any sense of self-control along with it. It\u2019s maddening, really.</p><p>Phil eyes him for a moment.\u201cDeal,\u201d he agrees with a nod, looking very pleased with the bargain. </p><p>Dan watches him glance down at his still hidden notebook, like he\u2019s still contemplating the offer, then smiles to himself before sharing all the details. \u201cIt\u2019s a Q and A video, like I told you yesterday\u2026\u201d He thinks for a moment, concentrating on his notes, then back to Dan with a little more confidence. \u201cBut I was thinking about doing it with another person there, like another youtuber asks me the questions, or maybe a friend?\u201d He explains, the concentration still very clear. He takes a sip of his coffee, brows furrowed like he\u2019s still thinking, so Dan waits until he continues, not wanting to interrupt Phils thought process.</p><p>Phil bites his lip, hesitating before he continues. \u201cI just don\u2019t want it to be boring, it needs something else, but I just don\u2019t know <i>what</i>.\u201d Phil sighs, beginning to sounds a little discouraged. \u201cEverything I come up with is ridiculous and stupid.\u201d He frowns, leaning back in his chair.</p><p>Dan tilts his head to the side smiling slightly as he fully registers what Phil is saying, and it all makes his heart fill to the point that his chest \u2013 as cheesy as it is \u2013 might explode. Dan could tell from watching Phil in his videos that he\u2019s passionate about what he does, but seeing it in action, seeing him so worked up about what it loves\u2026 It\u2019s enough make even Dan feel inspired. The man is just so genuine in what he does, maybe the whole youtube world isn\u2019t as shallow as Dan constantly assumes it is?</p><p>Dan swallows and finally responds. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound stupid to me. It sounds like you really care about your work. That in and of itself is enough to make a video interesting to watch,\u201d Dan assures Phil. <i>Where the hell is this positivity coming from?</i> \u201cThe fact that you\u2019re putting this much energy into it means its bound to be good. Besides I think it\u2019s a cool idea to have another person involved in the video.\u201d Seriously, when did Dan become this sparking ray of sunshine? Dan care barely muster the mindset to get out of bed in the morning? What is Phil doing to him? </p><p>The weird part is, Dan<i> actually </i>means every word he\u2019s saying.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I just feel like like the whole Q and A thing is so overdone, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Phil asks defeatedly, tapping his pencil on the table.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re overthinking it. Isn\u2019t that supposed to be my thing? Are you coming for my brand?\u201d Dan jokes, chuckling at the way Phil rolls his eyes in response. </p><p>\u201cSpeaking of your <i>brand</i>,\u201d Phil teases, \u201cI believe you owe me a sneak peek into Daniel Howell\u2019s next video.\u201d Phil looks him directly in the eye and Dan shivers at the use of his full name. It\u2019s hot, and it sounds really fucking good in Phil\u2019s voice. He has to take a moment not to jump Phil then and there. Christ, his younger self might have.</p><p>Phil looks at him with a questioning smirk, like he can read Dan\u2019s very terribly concealed  reaction to his words. Dan can feel his skin flush hot, and he jumps slightly when someone comes up to their table. It\u2019s that damn girl who seems to think 2009 emo is still a thing. Dan clenches his jaw, forcing himself not to make a sarcastic comment. </p><p>\u201cCan I get you anything?\u201d She asks flatly, staring at Dan. In her hands, she holds what looks like a torn scrap piece of paper and pen.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know this place did table service,\u201d Phil asks through his teeth, sounding annoyed as he looks at her in a way that doesn&rsquo;t scream friendly.</p><p>It\u2019s terrible, but it does makes Dan feel slightly better. Seeing Phil unimpressed with her is better than seeing them flirt.</p><p>\u201cWe do now,\u201d she snaps, turning to Dan. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she says sounding annoyed. </p><p>Dan furrows his brows, his gaze flitting back and forth between Sarah and Phil. Is she purposefully trying to interrupt them? Is <i>she</i> jealous? The thought pleases Dan. If she\u2019s jealous, that means there\u2019s something between him and Phil to be <i>jealous of.</i> On second thought, is Dan happy about that? Because that sounds awfully terrifying and real.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want anything.\u201d Dan remarks sassily and considers adding \u2018from you\u2019 to the sentence, but decides that might be a little too much sass. So instead he glares at her, willing her to walk away in his mind.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she scoffs, eyeing Dan like she doesn\u2019t believe him. For a second, she hovers before she spins on her heel back to the cashier where she barks an order at one of her co-workers.</p><p>Looks like Dan\u2019s will power worked for once.</p><p>\u201cYou get used to her,\u201d Phil reassures Dan. \u201cShe can be nice, I swear.  Look at this!\u201d Phil shows Dan the half sunken in, frothy Pikachu \u2014 the latte art that Dan already saw online, because he has a problem when it comes to stalking Phils social media.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I saw that on your Instagram when I was standing outsi- when I was walking here.\u201d Dan hasty corrects himself, almost blowing his cover that he\u2019s not a complete freak who avidly checks Phils instagram, and stands outside coffee shops for an embarrassing amount of time before actually go in to see him. Thankfully, Phil doesn\u2019t seem to catch on.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it adorable?\u201d Phil smiles, staring at the cup. Dan absolutely melts at the man\u2019s fondness for something as simple as themed latte art.</p><p>\u201cIt is, though probably a bit weird when you started sipping away Pikachu&rsquo;s face,\u201d Dan laughs slightly when Phil tilts his head to the side, realizing the damage he\u2019s done to poor Pikachu.</p><p>Phil looks at the cup then back at Dan, \u201cI didn\u2019t think about that.\u201d He chuckles, then playfully grimaces when he puts the cup down.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve crippled him for life Phil.\u201d Dean teases through a grin. \u201cHe\u2019ll never be the same.\u201d Dan adds, theatrically putting his hand on his heart and looks off into the distance.</p><p>Phil looks half traumatized, and half like he\u2019s trying not to laugh as he turns the deformed Pikachu away from him. \u201cI can\u2019t look him in the face, not anymore,\u201d Phil says dramatically.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Because he doesn\u2019t have one,\u201d Dan giggles and Phil can\u2019t hold back his laugh either. How is joking around with Phil so damn easy? Usually it takes Dan <i>weeks</i> to warm up to a person like he has to Phil.</p><p>Phil pretends to look shocked while giggling a little. \u201cDon\u2019t make it worse! I feel guilty enough as it is.\u201d Phil jokingly pleads, unable to hide his smile as he leans his notebook on the cup blocking it from his view.</p><p>Dan\u2019s eye catches a few words on the notebook, two of them jumping out and Dan immediately begins to sweat with anxiety.</p><p><i>Daniel Howell.</i></p><p>Is that Dan\u2019s name? Why the hell is his name there? Dan\u2019s mind desperately tries to imagine what purpose Phil could possibly have for his name being there. And worse, the sentences around Dan\u2019s name aren\u2019t helpful in any way and are basically a blur in Dan\u2019s panic, so they don\u2019t give him any clues. Is Phil planning on talking about Dan in his next video? Does he plan on telling his followers he\u2019s found his soulmate?</p><p>That he\u2019s found <i>Dan</i>?</p><p>Dan skin feels hot and his chest begins to prickle in a very unpleasant way. Is it him, or did this coffee shop used to be bigger before? The walls certainly seem a lot closer than he remembers. </p><p>Dan\u2019s not ready for any of this. He\u2019s not ready for the world to know. Feeling sick, he tries to read more of the notebook, looking for any details of what Phil has planned.</p><p>Phil quickly pulls back the notebook when he notices where Dan\u2019s eyes have landed. His gaze snaps up to Dan\u2019s, almost looking as panicked as Dan feels.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell anyone,\u201d Phil quickly blurts out. \u201cIt\u2019s just, I got a lot of questions about you!\u201d His words are quick, like he\u2019s trying to explain before Dan runs. \u201cI thought it would be weird if I didn\u2019t answer one. Considering about 80% of them were about you.\u201d he says panicked, clearly trying to explain himself. \u201cOur radio show really got people excited!\u201d Phil turns his notebook toward Dan and places it on the table in front of him. He points to one of the sentences near Dan\u2019s name.</p><p><b>What was it like having Dan on your radio show?!?!?! - @phillysgirl</b></p><p>It helps a little when Dan reads more, and all the questions Phil chose about him are relatively surface level. When he reaches the bottom though, Dan\u2019s cheeks flush. This ones a little cheeky.</p><p><b>Dan is one sexy man in his videos, does the same go for real life? - @Jessicab</b></p><p>\u201cI think the appropriate answer for the last question is yes.\u201d Dan nervously laughs, feeling his body become a little less tense. </p><p>Phil\u2019s eyes widen (he must have forgot about that last one) and he grabs his notebook back, closing it so the green cover faces up. \u201cAgreed.\u201d He laughs half heartedly.</p><p>Dan can tell Phil\u2019s trying not to scare him. And don\u2019t get Dan wrong, he wants nothing more than to run. To go back to his flat and pretend like the entire last month didn\u2019t happen. But he can\u2019t. He needs to know <i>for sure</i> that Phil won\u2019t tell anyone. He needs to be able to trust that Phil won\u2019t tell. But can Dan do that?</p><p>Once again, Dan is riddled with the knowledge that, as much as it feels like it, Dan doesn\u2019t <i>really </i>know who Phil is. He\u2019s a complete stranger. He could just be another youtuber out for the fame and nothing else \u2013 having Dan as his soulmate would only skyrocket his youtube channel further. People love drama, especially when romance and soulmates are involved.</p><p>Dan bites his lip so hard he tastes a hint of blood. \u201cI want to believe that you won\u2019t tell anyone, but how? I\u2019ve watched your videos, I know the person you show to the world. But I don\u2019t know<i> you</i>.\u201d Dan\u2019s tries to keep his voice even and professional, and he almost does until it wavers at the end.</p><p>Phils eyes soften at Dan\u2019s honesty; he seems a shocked at how open Dan is being. Phil leans forward, as if to show Dan that he has his full attention.  \u201cWell I can\u2019t say the person I show online is completely who I am, but give me a chance to show you that you can trust me.\u201d Phil is gentle, he\u2019s trying desperately not to scare Dan. \u201cI promise this isn\u2019t all a joke to me.\u201d he continues seriously, looking Dan directly in the eyes. \u201cBesides, I haven\u2019t told anyone yet have I? And it\u2019s been over a month since we\u2026\u201d Phil trails off, reflecting on the memory of their meeting. \u201cThough, it probably would have made an interesting tweet.\u201d Phil laughs awkwardly. \u201cJust met my soulmate, he ran away from me.\u201d Phil mocks Dan playfully.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2013 I didn\u2019t <i>run</i>, I haven\u2019t <i>run</i> in years,\u201d Dan defends himself, trying not to crack a small smile.</p><p>\u201cYou ran,\u201d Phil says matter of factly.</p><p>Yes, he definitely ran. Like a frightened child.</p><p>They sit in silence for a moment, just long enough for Dan to try and digest what is happening. How can they go from something serious to joking around so easily?</p><p>\u201cYou like Mario Kart?\u201d Phil pipes up, raising a brow.</p><p>\u201cOnly a crazy person would say no,\u201d Dan scoffs dramatically.</p><p>\u201cWant to come to mine and play a few rounds?\u201d Phil asks, sounding like he\u2019s trying not to be <i>too</i> hopeful.</p><p>Dan sighs and looks at Phil, studying the man intensely. He wants to go, but it feels like saying yes will open the floodgates to something Dan isn\u2019t ready for. If he says yes to this, Phil might be encouraged to invite Dan over more often. Or invite Dan <i>out</i>, even.</p><p>Is that a bad thing?</p><p>\u201cHow else are you supposed to learn to trust me, if you don\u2019t take the chance to get to know me?\u201d Phil needles, still managing to not come off <i>too</i> forward. But maybe forward is exactly the push Dan needs.</p><p>\u201cI not sure\u2026\u201d Dan\u2019s about to say no, but the disappointed frown Phil is already showing is too much for Dan to bare. Dan swallows thickly, and closes his eyes for a fraction of a second before looking back at Phil. \u201cAlright, a couple rounds won\u2019t hurt,\u201d Dan reluctantly agrees, and when Phil\u2019s eyes flare with excitement, Dan knows it\u2019s worth the anxiety.</p><p>\u201cGreat! My flat\u2019s about a fifteen-ish minute walk.\u201d Phil quickly begins to pack up his things, as if not wanting to give Dan the chance to back out.</p><p>Dan didn\u2019t bring much with his aside from his phone, so he stands up and waits for Phil to put everything in his backpack. Dan watches tentatively, savouring the small moment. It\u2019s strange seeing someone usually seen on the other side of a computer screen in real life. Dan\u2019s so used to seeing Phil from a certain angle \u2013 he watches Phil bring his plate and half full cup to the counter, and it feels <i>strange</i>. It\u2019s a good strange, though. Dan gets to see an unscripted part of him that few others get to see.</p><p>Who knew Dan could be so mesmerized by the back of someone\u2019s head?</p><p>Dan watches him make a comment to Sarah which actually makes her laugh, something Dan has yet to see her do since he walked into the shop \u2014 and any other encounter he\u2019s had with her, really.</p><p>Phil turns toward Dan and starts in his direction, \u201cReady?\u201d he asks, holding the door open for Dan.</p><p>As they first begin their walk, it\u2019s silent, but not the type of silence where Dan desperately tries to find a subject or make a sarcastic comment to fill the silence. But a silence that feels comfortable, natural even. They walk side by side, but now that Dan\u2019s made himself aware of the silence, he can\u2019t help but say something to break it.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Dan trials off realizing he didn\u2019t actually come up with anything to say. \u201cWhy amazingphil?\u201d Dan asks, quickly trying to recover. He looks curiously a Phil, pretty sure he knows the answer but still wonders \u2013 was he simply trying to be funny, or is he actually <i>that</i> clever?</p><p>\u201cWell, I could tell you,\u201d Phil smirks cheekily. \u201cBut then all my mystery and charm would be gone,\u201d he teases, sneaking a glance at Dan from the corner of his eye. He looks absolutely marvelous, and Dan nearly forgets how to breathe. The red stoplight from across the street elicits a red hue against Phil\u2019s skin, and bounces off the darkness of his hair, creating a red glow behind him.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s impossible.\u201d Dan breaths, slightly caught up in how stunning Phil is. Dan clears his throat, pretending he wasn\u2019t staring.</p><p>\u201cWhy the change from danisnotonfire, to Daniel Howell?\u201d Phil asks. Though if he\u2019s seen Dan\u2019s videos, he knows exactly why - Dan had explained it when he made the change. Maybe Phil was lying about seeing his video. Phil continues on before Dan has the chance to be disappointed, though. \u201cI mean I know<i> why</i>, but I want to know why exactly?\u201d Phil answers Dan\u2019s question. \u201cLike, what lead to the change?\u201d</p><p>Dan ponders the question for a moment. \u201cIt was time,\u201d Dan says finally. \u201cDanisnotonfire represents a different me. It was someone who was afraid to be themselves, but Daniel Howell on the other hand, he\u2019s working on living his truth.\u201d Dan says with more confidence than he expects. Sure he\u2019s said these things to a camera before, but never to a human person (that\u2019s not his therapist), that always seemed way to terrifying. He\u2019s not sure why he\u2019s being so honest with Phil. He can barely talk to Anne about this stuff, but here he is, telling someone who is practically a stranger.</p><p>\u201cDoes Daniel Howell always talk about himself in the third person?\u201d Phil chuckles, smiling fondly.</p><p>\u201cOnly when he\u2019s trying to dissociate himself from the serious and heavy shit in life,\u201d Dan jokes, looking at his feet as his cheeks colour with a blush.</p><p>\u201cThat seems healthy.\u201d Phil bumps Dan with his shoulder. \u201cThis is me.\u201d He points to a building that is significantly nicer than Dan\u2019s. Brick lines the exterior, leading up to at least five floors. Phil opens the glass door, leading to the entranceway. Dan takes note of the white marble walls as they make their way to the elevator, they\u2019d be perfect for his Instagram aesthetic. Which Dan knows is a terrible thing to come to mind immediately, but hey social media is literally his career. He can\u2019t help it.   </p><p>\u201cFancy,\u201d Dan remarks sarcastically, feeling a little intimidated. Dan knows Phil isn\u2019t hurting financially, between the popularity of his youtube channel and the radio show. Still, Dan can\u2019t help feeling a tad inadequate. Does this sort of stuff matter to Phil?</p><p>\u201cTrust me, it\u2019s not that fancy, wait until you actually see my flat. It\u2019s definitely due for some repairs.\u201d Phil assures Dan, pressing the button to floor five.</p><p>They step out into a narrow hall and stop at the first door on the left. Dan watches Phil open the door but doesn\u2019t follow him inside. Instead, he stands outside, hesitantly rocking from foot to foot. Facing the entrance of Phil\u2019s flat feels symbolic for some reason. Coming to Phil\u2019s place, laughing with him, talking to him, and not wanting the day to end. It\u2019s surreal.</p><p>Dan had literally spent a good chunk if his late teens \u2013 hell, his adulthood \u2013 dreaming of this exact scenario. And now, it\u2019s really happening.</p><p>How the<i> fuck</i> did Dan get here?</p><p>He\u2019s torn between excitement and resentment. Dan knows their banter and teasing is all fabricated, but a small part of him wishes it wasn\u2019t. Dan may have daydreamed about being Phil\u2019s soulmate, but he never actually <i>wanted</i> it to happen. If Dan had gotten to know Phil without the soulmate bullshit, he hoped it would have been because Phil is actually interested in Dan and his work, not out of obligation.</p><p>Dan is standing outside the home of the man of his dreams for all the wrong reasons. He\u2019s only here because the universe is telling Phil this is how it\u2019s supposed to be. But Dan hasn\u2019t been brainwashed to believe it like Phil.</p><p>Dan knows the truth - that soulmates are bullshit. And it leaves a small aching hole in his heart.</p><p>How is Dan supposed to know Phil <i>actually</i> wants him here? Did Phil only suggest he come over because they\u2019re soulmates? Does Phil really like having Dan around, or does he like the idea of him? The idea of being a part of an elite group of those who\u2019ve found the person they\u2019re supposed to spend the rest of their life with.</p><p>\u201cYou coming inside?\u201d Phil awkwardly chuckles, looking at Dan curiously.</p><p>\u201cYea, sorry,\u201d Dan mumbles, hesitant as he steps through the doorway. He\u2019s holding his breath as if waiting for something bad to happen, and when it doesn\u2019t, he exhales.</p><p>Maybe staying for an hour or so wouldn\u2019t hurt?</p><p>Dan shuts the door behind him and when he does, he hears a thump come from somewhere in the flat.</p><p>\u201cAlways so graceful she is,\u201d Phil sighs and turns toward the end of the hall. \u201cDo you want a drink?\u201d Phil offers with a shy smile, gesturing for Dan to follow him. \u201cOr tea?\u201d He asks over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cA drink is perfect,\u201d Dan says a little too eagerly, and follows Phil down the narrow hallway deeper into Phil\u2019s flat. The small hallway is relatively bare, aside from a plant, which has probably seen better days, placed near the door of Phil\u2019s kitchen. A sense of satisfaction comes to Dan knowing that the silly part of Phil he portrays about his inability to keep houseplants alive is true. Dan chuckles to himself. He knows it\u2019s common knowledge to Phil\u2019s followers, but seeing it in person makes Dan feel special somehow.</p><p>Phil follows Dan\u2019s eye to the poor plant. \u201cI kept it alive for quite a while!\u201d he defends himself while holding back a smile, clearly pretending to be serious. They walk into the kitchen, which is definitely bigger than Dan\u2019s, not to mention a lot more colourful, and Dan sees a row of small cacti along the backside of the counter. Of the five that live - or, well, <i>sit</i> - there, only one still resembles something close to the colour green.</p><p>\u201cJesus Phil,\u201d Dan laughs, \u201cYou don\u2019t even have to water a cactus that much, and you\u2019ve still managed to kill more than half of them,\u201d he teases, pointing to the unfortunate casualties. \u201cYou really weren\u2019t joking?\u201d Dan turns to Phil notices his slightly blushed cheeks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault! They just die! It\u2019s like I\u2019m cursed!\u201d Phil exclaims in defence as he grabs two wine glasses from one of his cupboards.</p><p>From around the corner, little patters of feet come bolting through the flat. Dan looks to Phil, who doesn\u2019t seem at all alarmed by the noise, and then back toward the opening to the far side of the kitchen. A small but absolutely adorable corgi comes zooming around the corner, with such speed it almost runs right into the wall.</p><p>Phil has a dog?</p><p>\u201cYou have a dog?\u201d Dan asks dumbfounded. Phil has <i>never</i> mentioned anything about a dog on his channel. Why has he never mentioned it? Dan\u2019s stomach knots, there\u2019s so much he doesn\u2019t know about Phil.</p><p>\u201cYes! Dan meet Nala, Nala meet Dan.\u201d Phil smiles down at the dog, as if hiding the fact that he has a dog - something that would probably get him loads of views, honestly - from his fans is a completely normal thing to do.</p><p>\u201cAnd why does no one know about this precious doggo?\u201d Dan asks genuinely shocked. But of course, Dan\u2019s confusion doesn\u2019t stop him from leaning down and petting the precious thing, she wags her tail, looking up at Dan and seeming satisfied by Dan\u2019s pets.</p><p>\u201cI really haven\u2019t had her that long, only about six months. I plan on introducing her to my viewers, just haven\u2019t gotten around to it yet,\u201d Phil explains, shrugging slightly. \u201cEvery time I think about it, I just get too distracted by how adorable she is and we end up playing or napping.\u201d Phil continues pouring white wine into their glasses. After, he hands Dan a bag of treats from one of the drawers.</p><p>\u201cWell, that is absolutely valid.\u201d Dan smiles down at the dog, sitting on the floor as he uses his baby voice to address her. \u201cYou are so cute Nala, yes you are.\u201d He feeds her a treat, and then two, and then two more. \u201cOkay, I better stop before you eat them all.\u201d Dan stands up, his heartbreaking at the disappointed look Nala gives him as she starts to wine.</p><p>Unable to help the smile on his face Dan looks to Phil, who is staring at Dan in a way that makes Dan\u2019s chest flutter. Phil looks absolutely mesmerized as he fondly smiles at the two of them. Dan clears his throat, making Phil go a very dark shade of red. </p><p>Phil rolls his eyes, pretending what just happened, didn\u2019t happen. \u201cShe\u2019s so dramatic, I swear,\u201d Phil says, sounding a bit fond still.  He then looks at the dog matter of factly, \u201cNala, you already had dinner today stop complaining.\u201d He\u2019s stern yet playful. \u201cEverything is set up in the lounge.\u201d Phil hands Dan his wine and gestures for him to follow him through the doorway where Nala had come bolting from.</p><p>There\u2019s a TV set up at the opposite end of the room, placed above a fireplace. </p><p>What Dan wouldn\u2019t give to have a fireplace.</p><p>They make their way to the couch, and Dan sits down on the completely opposite side of the sofa to Phil. Nala quickly follows suit, jumping up between them on the couch, thankfully making the space between them a little less obvious. Feeling nervous about being in Phils space, Dan takes a couple generous gulps of wine, then places his glass on the coffee table beside Phil\u2019s. </p><p>\u201cAlright, get ready for defeat.\u201d Phil taunts, powering up the game.</p><p>\u201cSomeone&rsquo;s confident. Enjoy it while you can, it won\u2019t last long.\u201d Dan bants back, taking the controller Phil hands him. Dan quickly checks his phone when he feels it vibrate in his pocket. Anne is texting him, but she can wait. He puts the phone on the table, focusing back to the game. They speed through selecting their players and carts, clearly each having a standard go-to, and dive right into the game.   </p><p>Dan wins. And wins and wins and wins. And then Phil <i>almost</i> wins, but Dan wins again. Every time they end a round, Phil somehow convinces Dan to start another, claiming he\u2019s just warming up. </p><p>\u201cOh sure, you just don\u2019t know when to quit,\u201d Dan teases starting the race again, which of course <i>he wins</i>.</p><p>\u201cHA!\u201d Dan shouts, probably far too loud for how late it is \u2013 hopefully Phil\u2019s walls aren\u2019t too thin. Nala makes her annoyance clear as she jumps off the couch and moves to the dog bed beside the television.</p><p>\u201cSee, told you,\u201d Dan continues, his volume a little more under control. \u201cI am the Mario Kart champion, no one can beat me.\u201d He smirks, putting his controller down on the coffee table and turning on the couch to face Phil. He\u2019s looking at Dan with the fondest smile, strange for someone who just lost nine times in a row.</p><p>\u201cLook it\u2019s not over yet. I could still have a few tricks up my sleeves.\u201d Phil confidently crosses his arms over his chest eyeing Dan.</p><p>\u201cSure, keep telling yourself that.\u201d Dan teases sarcastically, all while holding back a giggle, and instead rolling his eyes playfully.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to rematch another day, after I\u2019ve had time to perfect my skills.\u201d Phil tries to defend himself.</p><p>Remembering his wine, Dan leans forward to grab it, the cuff his sleeve riding up in the process of reaching for the glass. Dan freezes midway to the table, and he hears Phil\u2019s breath hitch. Dan looks overs and sees that Phil\u2019s eyes are boring into him. Following Phil\u2019s intense stare, Dan shifts his gaze to his wrist - his <i>nearly</i> <i>exposed</i> - wrist, and is starkly reminded of the name written there.</p><p>Dan puts the glass back on the table and nervously pulls his sleeves down. It takes him a moment to meet Phil\u2019s gaze. Dan had almost forgotten, he\u2019d almost let himself pretend the situation, their <i>friendship</i>, or whatever it is, isn\u2019t completely <i>fucked.</i></p><p>Phil swallows, and Dan watches his adam&rsquo;s apple bob. He clears his throat. \u201cCan I\u2026\u201d Phil trails off quietly, his hand on the couch inching towards Dan. </p><p>Dan can practically see the internal battle Phil is having with himself. </p><p>\u201cCan I see it?\u201d Phil gently asks, putting his own controller down to turn and face Dan more directly.</p><p>Dan\u2019s mouth goes dry.</p><p>The way Phil\u2019s looking at him pumps Dan full with anxiety. The desperation is clear, Phil wants things from Dan than Dan isn\u2019t sure he can give. But still, this is something Dan can give him. It couldn\u2019t hurt, right?</p><p>Dan pulls up his sleeve slightly, exposing his pale flesh where Phil\u2019s name is permanently tattooed into his skin.</p><p>Phil sucks in when he sees it. He reaches out but pulls his hand back immediately. Dan watches Phil intently. He watches the way Phil flexes his jaw, and holds his fist tight, forcing himself to keep his hands steady.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Dan says quietly, moving his wrist closer to Phil, silently telling him he can touch.</p><p>Phil looks at him surprised. \u201cYou sure?\u201d He asks softly, genuinely seeming to want Dan\u2019s permission.</p><p>\u201cYe- Yeah.\u201d Dan stutters, holding his breath.</p><p>Phil reaches out, but doesn\u2019t touch the raised skin with black letters first. Instead, he gently wraps his hand around Dan\u2019s wrist and lightly pulls it closer to his own body. Dan shivers, savouring the feeling of Phil\u2019s skin on his.</p><p>Dan shuffles closer so he doesn\u2019t have to awkwardly lean across the space between them. His knee rests in front of him on the couch and tingles where it touches Phil\u2019s thigh, even through the fabric of their jeans.</p><p>Dan feels restless as he watches Phil inspect the tattoo. Turning his head to the side curiously, Phil thumbs his finger over the name on Dan\u2019s skin. A rush of desire floods Dan\u2019s body and he finds himself leaning forward, his breath coming out heavy, matching Phil\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s strange,\u201d Phil breathes, furrowing his brow in concentration as he inspects the letters.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Dan clears his throat, lost in the moment. The sound of his own voice snaps him out of it and he quickly retracts his hand from Phil\u2019s. Immediately, he misses the warmth of Phil\u2019s palm. \u201cSorry,\u201d Dan apologizes for no particular reason and quickly stands up. \u201cI should go.\u201d Dan quickly mumbles, looking at the clock hanging on the wall. </p><p>How the hell is it already one in the morning.</p><p>\u201cOh, uh\u2026\u201d Phil begins, clearing his throat, he\u2019s about to say more but Dan is already out of sight, heading straight for the door. Dan winces when he slams it shut behind him, not expecting the loud bang when it hits the frame. But, it doesn\u2019t stop Dan from taking the stairs down two at a time to the lobby, too impatient to wait for the elevator. Too afraid that Phil would chase after him, Dan\u2019s pace quickens at the thought.</p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t stop walking until he makes it back to his flat, a walk that should have taken twenty minutes, he does in only seven. Probably the most vigorous physical activity Dan has done in months.</p><p>When he finally unlocks his door after three tries, Dan goes straight for the couch and flops onto the cushions, face first in his favourite fluffy pillow. </p><p>Things got way too personal.</p><p>He\u2019s such an idiot. How did he let the night get that far? Everything had been fine, fun even, until Phil had to go and make things serious.</p><p>Dan reaches for his pocket needing a distraction, but when he pats down his clothing he notices something vital missing.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\u201d Dan curses himself. He scrunches his eyes closed and looks up at the ceiling in defeat and lets out a long sigh.</p><p>He left his phone at Phil\u2019s place.</p>",
        "body_abstract": "\n<p><b>Summary:</b> Dan doesn&rsquo;t believe in soulmates, or at least that&rsquo;s what he tells himself when he looks down at the numbers on his arm.

The timer on Dan\u2019s arm counts down to the second that Dan will meet his soulmate, and despite his utter reluctance and dread for the moment to come, he almost finds himself happy it does. He might not have imagined it would happen the way it does, but he just can\u2019t help but feel something for the mysterious man named Philip Lester.

When he peeks his head around, he can see Phil sat at his usual spot through the smudged glass window and his heart begins pounding.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Beside his computer, Phil has his notebook open in front of him. He leans forward to scribble something onto the paper, making his glasses fall to the bridge of his nose. He pushes them back into place, and then runs his hands through his quiff, forcing it slightly askew. He\u2019s concentrating  so hard on his work that lines on his forehead have started indent his skin.\u00a0<br></p><p>He looks <i>so</i> serious.\u00a0</p><p>Dan imagines Phil looking at him like <i>that</i>, over his glasses with the stern look he has right now. Perhaps Phil\u2019s blue eyes would darken to something deeper, the thought only makes Dan mind wander</p><p>Dan pictures them alone in his flat with a finished bottle of wine, which was shared between the two of them, abandoned on the coffee table. Dan would bite his lip, the liquid courage making things easier; he\u2019d lean forward on the couch inching closer to Phil, feeling Phil\u2019s breath light on his skin because they\u2019re so close. Dan\u2019s hands find their way onto the denim material covering Phil\u2019s thigh, they slide up as their lips touch and\u2013</p><p>Someone sneezes as they walk past Dan, yanking him out of his daydream.</p><p>Swallowing down his desire, Dan tries to focus on Phil and actually muster up the courage to talk to the man. But Dan falters when he sees Phil open his phone and snap a picture of his coffee cup. Dan watches him review the photo then move the cup slightly to take another photo. This time he seems pleased; the corner of his mouth turns up slightly as he tilts his head to the side. His fingers tap away at the screen and Dan\u2019s chest flutters.</p><p>How can Phil go from making Dan want to rip his clothes off, to an adorable dork that he wants to hug, in just seconds?</p><p>It\u2019s <i>completely</i> unfair.</p><p>Dan\u2019s phone buzzes in his pocket. He pulls it out and unlocks it to see that Phil Lester has posted to his Instagram story. Dan chuckles to himself, knowing the process that lead to the notification, and how adorable Phil is. Dan taps on the circle, opening the story to reveal a picture of Phil\u2019s coffee with multiple flashy stickers surrounding it. At the bottom, the image reads \u2018Wow! Sarah, the magical barista put Pikachu in my cup!\u2019. And of course, there is an adorable Pikachu made in the froth of Phil\u2019s caramel macchiato, which dan can only assume is what Phil is drinking.</p><p>Dan squeezes his phone a little too tight. An ugly surge of jealousy knots in his stomach, same as the day he walked in on Phil and the barista \u2013 who Dan now knows is Sarah \u2013 giggling together. He\u2019s not sure what came over him that day, he\u2019d been working so hard on feeling indifferent to the whole <i>Phil and soulmates situation</i>. But when he saw them together, Dan snapped. He wasn\u2019t sure if they\u2019d been flirting or not, but even the idea makes Dan nauseous.</p><p>Groaning, Dan leans away from the window, resting against the side of the building. He shouldn\u2019t care. </p><p>But he <i>does</i>.</p><p>Of course Dan had to complicate things further when he actually sat down with Phil the last time he saw him. Sure, it wasn\u2019t as terribly awkward as Dan imagined, but he almost wished it had been. Then maybe he\u2019d be able to say with confidence that the universe got it wrong, and that they\u2019re completely opposite people and <i>nothing</i> alike.</p><p>Except, that they have<i> everything</i> in common \u2014 Dan knows from just watching Phil\u2019s videos over the years that they\u2019re perfect for each other. Hell, Dan doesn\u2019t remember a time when he didn\u2019t think they\u2019d get on well if they knew each other in real life.</p><p>Still, the things Phil shares on his channel are all superficial. Dan has yet to spend any actual time with Phil. He only knows the Phil that he portrays through his social media, Dan doesn\u2019t know the hidden version of Phil. Maybe that\u2019s where they\u2019ll clash. Aside from their small conversation yesterday, Phil only knows the persona Dan has assumed through his own youtube channel. Yesterday Dan was being himself, but the situation was still tense. Maybe once Phil gets to know who Dan really is, he won\u2019t be so eager when Dan walks through the door.</p><p>There\u2019s movement at Phil\u2019s table, grabbing Dan\u2019s attention. That <i>Sarah</i> girl is leaning against the back of the chair across from Phil. She says something to make Phil laugh, and Dan quickly reminded of how much this girl gets under his skin.</p><p>Dan imagines the annoyingly pretty girl sitting down, and Phil looking at <i>her </i>over his glasses in in that dreamy way. It\u2019s enough to agitate Dan further.</p><p>Dan\u2019s fists tighten at his sides and, without thinking, he marches straight to the shop\u2019s front door and yanks it open. <i>He</i> wants to be the one making Phil laugh, not some girl who probably just wants his attention because he\u2019s famous.</p><p>Determined not to look like blubbering idiot, Dan walks directly toward Phil, probably coming across more aggressive than confident. Phil spots Dan immediately and seems to say something to Sarah. She looks over her shoulder and Dan can see recognition dawn in her eyes before she quickly bolts away from Phil\u2019s table.</p><p>He really does <i>try </i>to not glare at her, but\u2026 sometimes his jealousy gets the best of him.</p><p>When Dan makes it to Phil\u2019s table, he realizes how stupid he is. He\u2019s enough of an idiot to walk into the building without a plan. Dan opens his mouth, but nothing comes out. What is he supposed to say? Why didn\u2019t he think this through? </p><p>It doesn\u2019t help with the way that Phil\u2019s looking at him; his eyes are an intense shade of blue. They\u2019re nothing like Dan\u2019s ever seen before, so sharp and daunting as he stares as Dan with his jaw slightly agape. Dan shutters slightly remembering his daydream from earlier \u2014 having him acting look at him like that sends a spark though Dan\u2019s chest. </p><p>Feeling suddenly <i>very</i> aware of his entire body, Dan focuses hard on not doing something completely embarrassing. He points to the chair, silently asking to sit. That was a completely natural and reasonable thing to do, right?</p><p>\u201cUh- oh yeah! Sit please!\u201d Phil almost shouts, eagerly moving his things aside, making room. Phil keenly smiles at Dan as his cheeks turn a light shade of red \u2013 he watches intently as Dan moves to sit. And Dan is thankful for the seat, because being around a slightly flustered Phil is enough to make Dan weak in the knees. Dan tries to relax but fails miserably \u2013 He can\u2019t help the way he holds his shoulders stiff as fidgets with the ripped material of his black jeans.  </p><p>\u201cYou seem-\u201d Dan\u2019s voice cracks slightly. He licks his lips, trying desperately not to feel flustered. He can\u2019t help it, though. Phil Lester is sitting across from him; how could he not be internally freaking out? Dan always imagined what conversations with Phil would be like, he practically rehearsed them daily, but now Dan\u2019s head is a jumbled mess.</p><p>Dan clears his throat. \u201cYou seem busy.\u201d He doesn\u2019t sound any more confident as he croaks, his words sounding like he desperately needs a glass of water.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working on my next video,\u201d Phil explains looking at his notebook. \u201cStill haven\u2019t quite figured it out yet,\u201d he mumbles, scratching his head. Dan\u2019s follows the movement, and his heart melts. From a distance, Phil had looked absolutely breathtaking, and up close \u2014 well, that\u2019s something Dan doesn\u2019t even know where to start and explain.</p><p>Dan never thought someone\u2019s skin could look so soft. He wants to reach out and trail the pads of his fingers over Phil\u2019s cheeks. Dan wants to feel every inch of Phil with his fingers, over the bridge of his nose, his smile lines, his lips. God his <i>lips</i>. They look so smooth \u2013 would they feel that way against Dan\u2019s own cracked and stress bitten ones? Would their kiss be as warm and soothing as Dan feels when Phil simply smiles at him?</p><p>Phil clears his throat and Dan realizes he\u2019s been staring. </p><p>Great, forget trying to seem confident, he\u2019s just gone straight to creepy.</p><p>\u201cIs it the same from yesterday, the Q and A? Any new ideas for it?\u201d Dan asks genuinely interested. His voice is shaky, and he tries not to let his cheeks become too flushed with embarrassment. His attempts are pointless, of course. Dan feels his cheeks warm as they turn to a rosy colour.</p><p>As much as Dan would love to marvel at how gorgeous Phil is, he needs something else to focus on because, unfortunately staring endlessly at Phil, being memorised by his smile, face, hair, and entire existence isn\u2019t the socially acceptable thing to do. Besides, Dan is still a massive fan of Phil\u2019s channel, getting the inside scoop of his next video is still a welcome distraction from the daydreaming about the gorgeous man. Though it\u2019s far less scandalous, it\u2019s still satisfying to hear about. </p><p>\u201cA few,\u201d Phil says, not sounding too confident in them.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me if you don\u2019t want to, but maybe you could bounce some ideas off me? Sometimes it helps to have another person\u2019s opinion,\u201d Dan offers. He knows what it\u2019s like to share an idea that\u2019s not completely ready, and he hates it. But Dan also knows what it\u2019s like to feel trapped in your head about something \u2014 a fresh pair of eyes really does help.</p><p>Phil takes a moment to look at his notebook \u2013 which he holds close out of Dan\u2019s sight \u2013 then at Dan. He eyes Dan with a smirk on his lips. \u201cHow do I know you won\u2019t go steal my ideas?\u201d </p><p>He\u2019s clearly joking but Dan can understand where Phil\u2019s coming from. It\u2019s not a serious question, but at the same time, it is. It\u2019s hard to trust people in the youtube industry these days.</p><p>\u201cMy lips are sealed\u201d Dan winks, \u201cand I\u2019ll tell you the plans for my next video in return.\u201d He wants to retract the arrangement he as soon as he offers it, but it\u2019s too late. When he\u2019s with Phil, he completely loses his natural filter and any sense of self-control along with it. It\u2019s maddening, really.</p><p>Phil eyes him for a moment.\u201cDeal,\u201d he agrees with a nod, looking very pleased with the bargain. </p><p>Dan watches him glance down at his still hidden notebook, like he\u2019s still contemplating the offer, then smiles to himself before sharing all the details. \u201cIt\u2019s a Q and A video, like I told you yesterday\u2026\u201d He thinks for a moment, concentrating on his notes, then back to Dan with a little more confidence. \u201cBut I was thinking about doing it with another person there, like another youtuber asks me the questions, or maybe a friend?\u201d He explains, the concentration still very clear. He takes a sip of his coffee, brows furrowed like he\u2019s still thinking, so Dan waits until he continues, not wanting to interrupt Phils thought process.</p><p>Phil bites his lip, hesitating before he continues. \u201cI just don\u2019t want it to be boring, it needs something else, but I just don\u2019t know <i>what</i>.\u201d Phil sighs, beginning to sounds a little discouraged. \u201cEverything I come up with is ridiculous and stupid.\u201d He frowns, leaning back in his chair.</p><p>Dan tilts his head to the side smiling slightly as he fully registers what Phil is saying, and it all makes his heart fill to the point that his chest \u2013 as cheesy as it is \u2013 might explode. Dan could tell from watching Phil in his videos that he\u2019s passionate about what he does, but seeing it in action, seeing him so worked up about what it loves\u2026 It\u2019s enough make even Dan feel inspired. The man is just so genuine in what he does, maybe the whole youtube world isn\u2019t as shallow as Dan constantly assumes it is?</p><p>Dan swallows and finally responds. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound stupid to me. It sounds like you really care about your work. That in and of itself is enough to make a video interesting to watch,\u201d Dan assures Phil. <i>Where the hell is this positivity coming from?</i> \u201cThe fact that you\u2019re putting this much energy into it means its bound to be good. Besides I think it\u2019s a cool idea to have another person involved in the video.\u201d Seriously, when did Dan become this sparking ray of sunshine? Dan care barely muster the mindset to get out of bed in the morning? What is Phil doing to him? </p><p>The weird part is, Dan<i> actually </i>means every word he\u2019s saying.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I just feel like like the whole Q and A thing is so overdone, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Phil asks defeatedly, tapping his pencil on the table.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re overthinking it. Isn\u2019t that supposed to be my thing? Are you coming for my brand?\u201d Dan jokes, chuckling at the way Phil rolls his eyes in response. </p><p>\u201cSpeaking of your <i>brand</i>,\u201d Phil teases, \u201cI believe you owe me a sneak peek into Daniel Howell\u2019s next video.\u201d Phil looks him directly in the eye and Dan shivers at the use of his full name. It\u2019s hot, and it sounds really fucking good in Phil\u2019s voice. He has to take a moment not to jump Phil then and there. Christ, his younger self might have.</p><p>Phil looks at him with a questioning smirk, like he can read Dan\u2019s very terribly concealed  reaction to his words. Dan can feel his skin flush hot, and he jumps slightly when someone comes up to their table. It\u2019s that damn girl who seems to think 2009 emo is still a thing. Dan clenches his jaw, forcing himself not to make a sarcastic comment. </p><p>\u201cCan I get you anything?\u201d She asks flatly, staring at Dan. In her hands, she holds what looks like a torn scrap piece of paper and pen.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know this place did table service,\u201d Phil asks through his teeth, sounding annoyed as he looks at her in a way that doesn\u2019t scream friendly.</p><p>It\u2019s terrible, but it does makes Dan feel slightly better. Seeing Phil unimpressed with her is better than seeing them flirt.</p><p>\u201cWe do now,\u201d she snaps, turning to Dan. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she says sounding annoyed. </p><p>Dan furrows his brows, his gaze flitting back and forth between Sarah and Phil. Is she purposefully trying to interrupt them? Is <i>she</i> jealous? The thought pleases Dan. If she\u2019s jealous, that means there\u2019s something between him and Phil to be <i>jealous of.</i> On second thought, is Dan happy about that? Because that sounds awfully terrifying and real.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want anything.\u201d Dan remarks sassily and considers adding \u2018from you\u2019 to the sentence, but decides that might be a little too much sass. So instead he glares at her, willing her to walk away in his mind.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she scoffs, eyeing Dan like she doesn\u2019t believe him. For a second, she hovers before she spins on her heel back to the cashier where she barks an order at one of her co-workers.</p><p>Looks like Dan\u2019s will power worked for once.</p><p>\u201cYou get used to her,\u201d Phil reassures Dan. \u201cShe can be nice, I swear.  Look at this!\u201d Phil shows Dan the half sunken in, frothy Pikachu \u2014 the latte art that Dan already saw online, because he has a problem when it comes to stalking Phils social media.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I saw that on your Instagram when I was standing outsi- when I was walking here.\u201d Dan hasty corrects himself, almost blowing his cover that he\u2019s not a complete freak who avidly checks Phils instagram, and stands outside coffee shops for an embarrassing amount of time before actually go in to see him. Thankfully, Phil doesn\u2019t seem to catch on.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it adorable?\u201d Phil smiles, staring at the cup. Dan absolutely melts at the man\u2019s fondness for something as simple as themed latte art.</p><p>\u201cIt is, though probably a bit weird when you started sipping away Pikachu\u2019s face,\u201d Dan laughs slightly when Phil tilts his head to the side, realizing the damage he\u2019s done to poor Pikachu.</p><p>Phil looks at the cup then back at Dan, \u201cI didn\u2019t think about that.\u201d He chuckles, then playfully grimaces when he puts the cup down.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve crippled him for life Phil.\u201d Dean teases through a grin. \u201cHe\u2019ll never be the same.\u201d Dan adds, theatrically putting his hand on his heart and looks off into the distance.</p><p>Phil looks half traumatized, and half like he\u2019s trying not to laugh as he turns the deformed Pikachu away from him. \u201cI can\u2019t look him in the face, not anymore,\u201d Phil says dramatically.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Because he doesn\u2019t have one,\u201d Dan giggles and Phil can\u2019t hold back his laugh either. How is joking around with Phil so damn easy? Usually it takes Dan <i>weeks</i> to warm up to a person like he has to Phil.</p><p>Phil pretends to look shocked while giggling a little. \u201cDon\u2019t make it worse! I feel guilty enough as it is.\u201d Phil jokingly pleads, unable to hide his smile as he leans his notebook on the cup blocking it from his view.</p><p>Dan\u2019s eye catches a few words on the notebook, two of them jumping out and Dan immediately begins to sweat with anxiety.</p><p><i>Daniel Howell.</i></p><p>Is that Dan\u2019s name? Why the hell is his name there? Dan\u2019s mind desperately tries to imagine what purpose Phil could possibly have for his name being there. And worse, the sentences around Dan\u2019s name aren\u2019t helpful in any way and are basically a blur in Dan\u2019s panic, so they don\u2019t give him any clues. Is Phil planning on talking about Dan in his next video? Does he plan on telling his followers he\u2019s found his soulmate?</p><p>That he\u2019s found <i>Dan</i>?</p><p>Dan skin feels hot and his chest begins to prickle in a very unpleasant way. Is it him, or did this coffee shop used to be bigger before? The walls certainly seem a lot closer than he remembers. </p><p>Dan\u2019s not ready for any of this. He\u2019s not ready for the world to know. Feeling sick, he tries to read more of the notebook, looking for any details of what Phil has planned.</p><p>Phil quickly pulls back the notebook when he notices where Dan\u2019s eyes have landed. His gaze snaps up to Dan\u2019s, almost looking as panicked as Dan feels.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell anyone,\u201d Phil quickly blurts out. \u201cIt\u2019s just, I got a lot of questions about you!\u201d His words are quick, like he\u2019s trying to explain before Dan runs. \u201cI thought it would be weird if I didn\u2019t answer one. Considering about 80% of them were about you.\u201d he says panicked, clearly trying to explain himself. \u201cOur radio show really got people excited!\u201d Phil turns his notebook toward Dan and places it on the table in front of him. He points to one of the sentences near Dan\u2019s name.</p><p><b>What was it like having Dan on your radio show?!?!?! - @phillysgirl</b></p><p>It helps a little when Dan reads more, and all the questions Phil chose about him are relatively surface level. When he reaches the bottom though, Dan\u2019s cheeks flush. This ones a little cheeky.</p><p><b>Dan is one sexy man in his videos, does the same go for real life? - @Jessicab</b></p><p>\u201cI think the appropriate answer for the last question is yes.\u201d Dan nervously laughs, feeling his body become a little less tense. </p><p>Phil\u2019s eyes widen (he must have forgot about that last one) and he grabs his notebook back, closing it so the green cover faces up. \u201cAgreed.\u201d He laughs half heartedly.</p><p>Dan can tell Phil\u2019s trying not to scare him. And don\u2019t get Dan wrong, he wants nothing more than to run. To go back to his flat and pretend like the entire last month didn\u2019t happen. But he can\u2019t. He needs to know <i>for sure</i> that Phil won\u2019t tell anyone. He needs to be able to trust that Phil won\u2019t tell. But can Dan do that?</p><p>Once again, Dan is riddled with the knowledge that, as much as it feels like it, Dan doesn\u2019t <i>really </i>know who Phil is. He\u2019s a complete stranger. He could just be another youtuber out for the fame and nothing else \u2013 having Dan as his soulmate would only skyrocket his youtube channel further. People love drama, especially when romance and soulmates are involved.</p><p>Dan bites his lip so hard he tastes a hint of blood. \u201cI want to believe that you won\u2019t tell anyone, but how? I\u2019ve watched your videos, I know the person you show to the world. But I don\u2019t know<i> you</i>.\u201d Dan\u2019s tries to keep his voice even and professional, and he almost does until it wavers at the end.</p><p>Phils eyes soften at Dan\u2019s honesty; he seems a shocked at how open Dan is being. Phil leans forward, as if to show Dan that he has his full attention.  \u201cWell I can\u2019t say the person I show online is completely who I am, but give me a chance to show you that you can trust me.\u201d Phil is gentle, he\u2019s trying desperately not to scare Dan. \u201cI promise this isn\u2019t all a joke to me.\u201d he continues seriously, looking Dan directly in the eyes. \u201cBesides, I haven\u2019t told anyone yet have I? And it\u2019s been over a month since we\u2026\u201d Phil trails off, reflecting on the memory of their meeting. \u201cThough, it probably would have made an interesting tweet.\u201d Phil laughs awkwardly. \u201cJust met my soulmate, he ran away from me.\u201d Phil mocks Dan playfully.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2013 I didn\u2019t <i>run</i>, I haven\u2019t <i>run</i> in years,\u201d Dan defends himself, trying not to crack a small smile.</p><p>\u201cYou ran,\u201d Phil says matter of factly.</p><p>Yes, he definitely ran. Like a frightened child.</p><p>They sit in silence for a moment, just long enough for Dan to try and digest what is happening. How can they go from something serious to joking around so easily?</p><p>\u201cYou like Mario Kart?\u201d Phil pipes up, raising a brow.</p><p>\u201cOnly a crazy person would say no,\u201d Dan scoffs dramatically.</p><p>\u201cWant to come to mine and play a few rounds?\u201d Phil asks, sounding like he\u2019s trying not to be <i>too</i> hopeful.</p><p>Dan sighs and looks at Phil, studying the man intensely. He wants to go, but it feels like saying yes will open the floodgates to something Dan isn\u2019t ready for. If he says yes to this, Phil might be encouraged to invite Dan over more often. Or invite Dan <i>out</i>, even.</p><p>Is that a bad thing?</p><p>\u201cHow else are you supposed to learn to trust me, if you don\u2019t take the chance to get to know me?\u201d Phil needles, still managing to not come off <i>too</i> forward. But maybe forward is exactly the push Dan needs.</p><p>\u201cI not sure\u2026\u201d Dan\u2019s about to say no, but the disappointed frown Phil is already showing is too much for Dan to bare. Dan swallows thickly, and closes his eyes for a fraction of a second before looking back at Phil. \u201cAlright, a couple rounds won\u2019t hurt,\u201d Dan reluctantly agrees, and when Phil\u2019s eyes flare with excitement, Dan knows it\u2019s worth the anxiety.</p><p>\u201cGreat! My flat\u2019s about a fifteen-ish minute walk.\u201d Phil quickly begins to pack up his things, as if not wanting to give Dan the chance to back out.</p><p>Dan didn\u2019t bring much with his aside from his phone, so he stands up and waits for Phil to put everything in his backpack. Dan watches tentatively, savouring the small moment. It\u2019s strange seeing someone usually seen on the other side of a computer screen in real life. Dan\u2019s so used to seeing Phil from a certain angle \u2013 he watches Phil bring his plate and half full cup to the counter, and it feels <i>strange</i>. It\u2019s a good strange, though. Dan gets to see an unscripted part of him that few others get to see.</p><p>Who knew Dan could be so mesmerized by the back of someone\u2019s head?</p><p>Dan watches him make a comment to Sarah which actually makes her laugh, something Dan has yet to see her do since he walked into the shop \u2014 and any other encounter he\u2019s had with her, really.</p><p>Phil turns toward Dan and starts in his direction, \u201cReady?\u201d he asks, holding the door open for Dan.</p><p>As they first begin their walk, it\u2019s silent, but not the type of silence where Dan desperately tries to find a subject or make a sarcastic comment to fill the silence. But a silence that feels comfortable, natural even. They walk side by side, but now that Dan\u2019s made himself aware of the silence, he can\u2019t help but say something to break it.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Dan trials off realizing he didn\u2019t actually come up with anything to say. \u201cWhy amazingphil?\u201d Dan asks, quickly trying to recover. He looks curiously a Phil, pretty sure he knows the answer but still wonders \u2013 was he simply trying to be funny, or is he actually <i>that</i> clever?</p><p>\u201cWell, I could tell you,\u201d Phil smirks cheekily. \u201cBut then all my mystery and charm would be gone,\u201d he teases, sneaking a glance at Dan from the corner of his eye. He looks absolutely marvelous, and Dan nearly forgets how to breathe. The red stoplight from across the street elicits a red hue against Phil\u2019s skin, and bounces off the darkness of his hair, creating a red glow behind him.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s impossible.\u201d Dan breaths, slightly caught up in how stunning Phil is. Dan clears his throat, pretending he wasn\u2019t staring.</p><p>\u201cWhy the change from danisnotonfire, to Daniel Howell?\u201d Phil asks. Though if he\u2019s seen Dan\u2019s videos, he knows exactly why - Dan had explained it when he made the change. Maybe Phil was lying about seeing his video. Phil continues on before Dan has the chance to be disappointed, though. \u201cI mean I know<i> why</i>, but I want to know why exactly?\u201d Phil answers Dan\u2019s question. \u201cLike, what lead to the change?\u201d</p><p>Dan ponders the question for a moment. \u201cIt was time,\u201d Dan says finally. \u201cDanisnotonfire represents a different me. It was someone who was afraid to be themselves, but Daniel Howell on the other hand, he\u2019s working on living his truth.\u201d Dan says with more confidence than he expects. Sure he\u2019s said these things to a camera before, but never to a human person (that\u2019s not his therapist), that always seemed way to terrifying. He\u2019s not sure why he\u2019s being so honest with Phil. He can barely talk to Anne about this stuff, but here he is, telling someone who is practically a stranger.</p><p>\u201cDoes Daniel Howell always talk about himself in the third person?\u201d Phil chuckles, smiling fondly.</p><p>\u201cOnly when he\u2019s trying to dissociate himself from the serious and heavy shit in life,\u201d Dan jokes, looking at his feet as his cheeks colour with a blush.</p><p>\u201cThat seems healthy.\u201d Phil bumps Dan with his shoulder. \u201cThis is me.\u201d He points to a building that is significantly nicer than Dan\u2019s. Brick lines the exterior, leading up to at least five floors. Phil opens the glass door, leading to the entranceway. Dan takes note of the white marble walls as they make their way to the elevator, they\u2019d be perfect for his Instagram aesthetic. Which Dan knows is a terrible thing to come to mind immediately, but hey social media is literally his career. He can\u2019t help it.   </p><p>\u201cFancy,\u201d Dan remarks sarcastically, feeling a little intimidated. Dan knows Phil isn\u2019t hurting financially, between the popularity of his youtube channel and the radio show. Still, Dan can\u2019t help feeling a tad inadequate. Does this sort of stuff matter to Phil?</p><p>\u201cTrust me, it\u2019s not that fancy, wait until you actually see my flat. It\u2019s definitely due for some repairs.\u201d Phil assures Dan, pressing the button to floor five.</p><p>They step out into a narrow hall and stop at the first door on the left. Dan watches Phil open the door but doesn\u2019t follow him inside. Instead, he stands outside, hesitantly rocking from foot to foot. Facing the entrance of Phil\u2019s flat feels symbolic for some reason. Coming to Phil\u2019s place, laughing with him, talking to him, and not wanting the day to end. It\u2019s surreal.</p><p>Dan had literally spent a good chunk if his late teens \u2013 hell, his adulthood \u2013 dreaming of this exact scenario. And now, it\u2019s really happening.</p><p>How the<i> fuck</i> did Dan get here?</p><p>He\u2019s torn between excitement and resentment. Dan knows their banter and teasing is all fabricated, but a small part of him wishes it wasn\u2019t. Dan may have daydreamed about being Phil\u2019s soulmate, but he never actually <i>wanted</i> it to happen. If Dan had gotten to know Phil without the soulmate bullshit, he hoped it would have been because Phil is actually interested in Dan and his work, not out of obligation.</p><p>Dan is standing outside the home of the man of his dreams for all the wrong reasons. He\u2019s only here because the universe is telling Phil this is how it\u2019s supposed to be. But Dan hasn\u2019t been brainwashed to believe it like Phil.</p><p>Dan knows the truth - that soulmates are bullshit. And it leaves a small aching hole in his heart.</p><p>How is Dan supposed to know Phil <i>actually</i> wants him here? Did Phil only suggest he come over because they\u2019re soulmates? Does Phil really like having Dan around, or does he like the idea of him? The idea of being a part of an elite group of those who\u2019ve found the person they\u2019re supposed to spend the rest of their life with.</p><p>\u201cYou coming inside?\u201d Phil awkwardly chuckles, looking at Dan curiously.</p><p>\u201cYea, sorry,\u201d Dan mumbles, hesitant as he steps through the doorway. He\u2019s holding his breath as if waiting for something bad to happen, and when it doesn\u2019t, he exhales.</p><p>Maybe staying for an hour or so wouldn\u2019t hurt?</p><p>Dan shuts the door behind him and when he does, he hears a thump come from somewhere in the flat.</p><p>\u201cAlways so graceful she is,\u201d Phil sighs and turns toward the end of the hall. \u201cDo you want a drink?\u201d Phil offers with a shy smile, gesturing for Dan to follow him. \u201cOr tea?\u201d He asks over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cA drink is perfect,\u201d Dan says a little too eagerly, and follows Phil down the narrow hallway deeper into Phil\u2019s flat. The small hallway is relatively bare, aside from a plant, which has probably seen better days, placed near the door of Phil\u2019s kitchen. A sense of satisfaction comes to Dan knowing that the silly part of Phil he portrays about his inability to keep houseplants alive is true. Dan chuckles to himself. He knows it\u2019s common knowledge to Phil\u2019s followers, but seeing it in person makes Dan feel special somehow.</p><p>Phil follows Dan\u2019s eye to the poor plant. \u201cI kept it alive for quite a while!\u201d he defends himself while holding back a smile, clearly pretending to be serious. They walk into the kitchen, which is definitely bigger than Dan\u2019s, not to mention a lot more colourful, and Dan sees a row of small cacti along the backside of the counter. Of the five that live - or, well, <i>sit</i> - there, only one still resembles something close to the colour green.</p><p>\u201cJesus Phil,\u201d Dan laughs, \u201cYou don\u2019t even have to water a cactus that much, and you\u2019ve still managed to kill more than half of them,\u201d he teases, pointing to the unfortunate casualties. \u201cYou really weren\u2019t joking?\u201d Dan turns to Phil notices his slightly blushed cheeks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault! They just die! It\u2019s like I\u2019m cursed!\u201d Phil exclaims in defence as he grabs two wine glasses from one of his cupboards.</p><p>From around the corner, little patters of feet come bolting through the flat. Dan looks to Phil, who doesn\u2019t seem at all alarmed by the noise, and then back toward the opening to the far side of the kitchen. A small but absolutely adorable corgi comes zooming around the corner, with such speed it almost runs right into the wall.</p><p>Phil has a dog?</p><p>\u201cYou have a dog?\u201d Dan asks dumbfounded. Phil has <i>never</i> mentioned anything about a dog on his channel. Why has he never mentioned it? Dan\u2019s stomach knots, there\u2019s so much he doesn\u2019t know about Phil.</p><p>\u201cYes! Dan meet Nala, Nala meet Dan.\u201d Phil smiles down at the dog, as if hiding the fact that he has a dog - something that would probably get him loads of views, honestly - from his fans is a completely normal thing to do.</p><p>\u201cAnd why does no one know about this precious doggo?\u201d Dan asks genuinely shocked. But of course, Dan\u2019s confusion doesn\u2019t stop him from leaning down and petting the precious thing, she wags her tail, looking up at Dan and seeming satisfied by Dan\u2019s pets.</p><p>\u201cI really haven\u2019t had her that long, only about six months. I plan on introducing her to my viewers, just haven\u2019t gotten around to it yet,\u201d Phil explains, shrugging slightly. \u201cEvery time I think about it, I just get too distracted by how adorable she is and we end up playing or napping.\u201d Phil continues pouring white wine into their glasses. After, he hands Dan a bag of treats from one of the drawers.</p><p>\u201cWell, that is absolutely valid.\u201d Dan smiles down at the dog, sitting on the floor as he uses his baby voice to address her. \u201cYou are so cute Nala, yes you are.\u201d He feeds her a treat, and then two, and then two more. \u201cOkay, I better stop before you eat them all.\u201d Dan stands up, his heartbreaking at the disappointed look Nala gives him as she starts to wine.</p><p>Unable to help the smile on his face Dan looks to Phil, who is staring at Dan in a way that makes Dan\u2019s chest flutter. Phil looks absolutely mesmerized as he fondly smiles at the two of them. Dan clears his throat, making Phil go a very dark shade of red. </p><p>Phil rolls his eyes, pretending what just happened, didn\u2019t happen. \u201cShe\u2019s so dramatic, I swear,\u201d Phil says, sounding a bit fond still.  He then looks at the dog matter of factly, \u201cNala, you already had dinner today stop complaining.\u201d He\u2019s stern yet playful. \u201cEverything is set up in the lounge.\u201d Phil hands Dan his wine and gestures for him to follow him through the doorway where Nala had come bolting from.</p><p>There\u2019s a TV set up at the opposite end of the room, placed above a fireplace. </p><p>What Dan wouldn\u2019t give to have a fireplace.</p><p>They make their way to the couch, and Dan sits down on the completely opposite side of the sofa to Phil. Nala quickly follows suit, jumping up between them on the couch, thankfully making the space between them a little less obvious. Feeling nervous about being in Phils space, Dan takes a couple generous gulps of wine, then places his glass on the coffee table beside Phil\u2019s. </p><p>\u201cAlright, get ready for defeat.\u201d Phil taunts, powering up the game.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s confident. Enjoy it while you can, it won\u2019t last long.\u201d Dan bants back, taking the controller Phil hands him. Dan quickly checks his phone when he feels it vibrate in his pocket. Anne is texting him, but she can wait. He puts the phone on the table, focusing back to the game. They speed through selecting their players and carts, clearly each having a standard go-to, and dive right into the game.   </p><p>Dan wins. And wins and wins and wins. And then Phil <i>almost</i> wins, but Dan wins again. Every time they end a round, Phil somehow convinces Dan to start another, claiming he\u2019s just warming up. </p><p>\u201cOh sure, you just don\u2019t know when to quit,\u201d Dan teases starting the race again, which of course <i>he wins</i>.</p><p>\u201cHA!\u201d Dan shouts, probably far too loud for how late it is \u2013 hopefully Phil\u2019s walls aren\u2019t too thin. Nala makes her annoyance clear as she jumps off the couch and moves to the dog bed beside the television.</p><p>\u201cSee, told you,\u201d Dan continues, his volume a little more under control. \u201cI am the Mario Kart champion, no one can beat me.\u201d He smirks, putting his controller down on the coffee table and turning on the couch to face Phil. He\u2019s looking at Dan with the fondest smile, strange for someone who just lost nine times in a row.</p><p>\u201cLook it\u2019s not over yet. I could still have a few tricks up my sleeves.\u201d Phil confidently crosses his arms over his chest eyeing Dan.</p><p>\u201cSure, keep telling yourself that.\u201d Dan teases sarcastically, all while holding back a giggle, and instead rolling his eyes playfully.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to rematch another day, after I\u2019ve had time to perfect my skills.\u201d Phil tries to defend himself.</p><p>Remembering his wine, Dan leans forward to grab it, the cuff his sleeve riding up in the process of reaching for the glass. Dan freezes midway to the table, and he hears Phil\u2019s breath hitch. Dan looks overs and sees that Phil\u2019s eyes are boring into him. Following Phil\u2019s intense stare, Dan shifts his gaze to his wrist - his <i>nearly</i> <i>exposed</i> - wrist, and is starkly reminded of the name written there.</p><p>Dan puts the glass back on the table and nervously pulls his sleeves down. It takes him a moment to meet Phil\u2019s gaze. Dan had almost forgotten, he\u2019d almost let himself pretend the situation, their <i>friendship</i>, or whatever it is, isn\u2019t completely <i>fucked.</i></p><p>Phil swallows, and Dan watches his adam\u2019s apple bob. He clears his throat. \u201cCan I\u2026\u201d Phil trails off quietly, his hand on the couch inching towards Dan. </p><p>Dan can practically see the internal battle Phil is having with himself. </p><p>\u201cCan I see it?\u201d Phil gently asks, putting his own controller down to turn and face Dan more directly.</p><p>Dan\u2019s mouth goes dry.</p><p>The way Phil\u2019s looking at him pumps Dan full with anxiety. The desperation is clear, Phil wants things from Dan than Dan isn\u2019t sure he can give. But still, this is something Dan can give him. It couldn\u2019t hurt, right?</p><p>Dan pulls up his sleeve slightly, exposing his pale flesh where Phil\u2019s name is permanently tattooed into his skin.</p><p>Phil sucks in when he sees it. He reaches out but pulls his hand back immediately. Dan watches Phil intently. He watches the way Phil flexes his jaw, and holds his fist tight, forcing himself to keep his hands steady.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Dan says quietly, moving his wrist closer to Phil, silently telling him he can touch.</p><p>Phil looks at him surprised. \u201cYou sure?\u201d He asks softly, genuinely seeming to want Dan\u2019s permission.</p><p>\u201cYe- Yeah.\u201d Dan stutters, holding his breath.</p><p>Phil reaches out, but doesn\u2019t touch the raised skin with black letters first. Instead, he gently wraps his hand around Dan\u2019s wrist and lightly pulls it closer to his own body. Dan shivers, savouring the feeling of Phil\u2019s skin on his.</p><p>Dan shuffles closer so he doesn\u2019t have to awkwardly lean across the space between them. His knee rests in front of him on the couch and tingles where it touches Phil\u2019s thigh, even through the fabric of their jeans.</p><p>Dan feels restless as he watches Phil inspect the tattoo. Turning his head to the side curiously, Phil thumbs his finger over the name on Dan\u2019s skin. A rush of desire floods Dan\u2019s body and he finds himself leaning forward, his breath coming out heavy, matching Phil\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s strange,\u201d Phil breathes, furrowing his brow in concentration as he inspects the letters.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Dan clears his throat, lost in the moment. The sound of his own voice snaps him out of it and he quickly retracts his hand from Phil\u2019s. Immediately, he misses the warmth of Phil\u2019s palm. \u201cSorry,\u201d Dan apologizes for no particular reason and quickly stands up. \u201cI should go.\u201d Dan quickly mumbles, looking at the clock hanging on the wall. </p><p>How the hell is it already one in the morning.</p><p>\u201cOh, uh\u2026\u201d Phil begins, clearing his throat, he\u2019s about to say more but Dan is already out of sight, heading straight for the door. Dan winces when he slams it shut behind him, not expecting the loud bang when it hits the frame. But, it doesn\u2019t stop Dan from taking the stairs down two at a time to the lobby, too impatient to wait for the elevator. Too afraid that Phil would chase after him, Dan\u2019s pace quickens at the thought.</p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t stop walking until he makes it back to his flat, a walk that should have taken twenty minutes, he does in only seven. Probably the most vigorous physical activity Dan has done in months.</p><p>When he finally unlocks his door after three tries, Dan goes straight for the couch and flops onto the cushions, face first in his favourite fluffy pillow. </p><p>Things got way too personal.</p><p>He\u2019s such an idiot. How did he let the night get that far? Everything had been fine, fun even, until Phil had to go and make things serious.</p><p>Dan reaches for his pocket needing a distraction, but when he pats down his clothing he notices something vital missing.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\u201d Dan curses himself. He scrunches his eyes closed and looks up at the ceiling in defeat and lets out a long sigh.</p><p>He left his phone at Phil\u2019s place.</p>",

When he peeks his head around, he can see Phil sat at his usual spot through the smudged glass window and his heart begins pounding.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Beside his computer, Phil has his notebook open in front of him. He leans forward to scribble something onto the paper, making his glasses fall to the bridge of his nose. He pushes them back into place, and then runs his hands through his quiff, forcing it slightly askew. He\u2019s concentrating  so hard on his work that lines on his forehead have started indent his skin.\u00a0<br></p><p>He looks <i>so</i> serious.\u00a0</p><p>Dan imagines Phil looking at him like <i>that</i>, over his glasses with the stern look he has right now.

Dan would bite his lip, the liquid courage making things easier; he\u2019d lean forward on the couch inching closer to Phil, feeling Phil\u2019s breath light on his skin because they\u2019re so close. Dan\u2019s hands find their way onto the denim material covering Phil\u2019s thigh, they slide up as their lips touch and\u2013</p><p>Someone sneezes as they walk past Dan, yanking him out of his daydream.</p><p>Swallowing down his desire, Dan tries to focus on Phil and actually muster up the courage to talk to the man. But Dan falters when he sees Phil open his phone and snap a picture of his coffee cup. Dan watches him review the photo then move the cup slightly to take another photo. This time he seems pleased; the corner of his mouth turns up slightly as he tilts his head to the side. His fingers tap away at the screen and Dan\u2019s chest flutters.</p><p>How can Phil go from making Dan want to rip his clothes off, to an adorable dork that he wants to hug, in just seconds?</p><p>It\u2019s <i>completely</i> unfair.</p><p>Dan\u2019s phone buzzes in his pocket. He pulls it out and unlocks it to see that Phil Lester has posted to his Instagram story. Dan chuckles to himself, knowing the process that lead to the notification, and how adorable Phil is. Dan taps on the circle, opening the story to reveal a picture of Phil\u2019s coffee with multiple flashy stickers surrounding it. At the bottom, the image reads \u2018Wow! Sarah, the magical barista put Pikachu in my cup!\u2019. And of course, there is an adorable Pikachu made in the froth of Phil\u2019s caramel macchiato, which dan can only assume is what Phil is drinking.</p><p>Dan squeezes his phone a little too tight. An ugly surge of jealousy knots in his stomach, same as the day he walked in on Phil and the barista \u2013 who Dan now knows is Sarah \u2013 giggling together. He\u2019s not sure what came over him that day, he\u2019d been working so hard on feeling indifferent to the whole <i>Phil and soulmates situation</i>. But when he saw them together, Dan snapped. He wasn\u2019t sure if they\u2019d been flirting or not, but even the idea makes Dan nauseous.</p><p>Groaning, Dan leans away from the window, resting against the side of the building. He shouldn\u2019t care. </p><p>But he <i>does</i>.</p><p>Of course Dan had to complicate things further when he actually sat down with Phil the last time he saw him. Sure, it wasn\u2019t as terribly awkward as Dan imagined, but he almost wished it had been. Then maybe he\u2019d be able to say with confidence that the universe got it wrong, and that they\u2019re completely opposite people and <i>nothing</i> alike.</p><p>Except, that they have<i> everything</i> in common \u2014 Dan knows from just watching Phil\u2019s videos over the years that they\u2019re perfect for each other. Hell, Dan doesn\u2019t remember a time when he didn\u2019t think they\u2019d get on well if they knew each other in real life.</p><p>Still, the things Phil shares on his channel are all superficial. Dan has yet to spend any actual time with Phil. He only knows the Phil that he portrays through his social media, Dan doesn\u2019t know the hidden version of Phil. Maybe that\u2019s where they\u2019ll clash. Aside from their small conversation yesterday, Phil only knows the persona Dan has assumed through his own youtube channel. Yesterday Dan was being himself, but the situation was still tense. Maybe once Phil gets to know who Dan really is, he won\u2019t be so eager when Dan walks through the door.</p><p>There\u2019s movement at Phil\u2019s table, grabbing Dan\u2019s attention. That <i>Sarah</i> girl is leaning against the back of the chair across from Phil. She says something to make Phil laugh, and Dan quickly reminded of how much this girl gets under his skin.</p><p>Dan imagines the annoyingly pretty girl sitting down, and Phil looking at <i>her </i>over his glasses in in that dreamy way. It\u2019s enough to agitate Dan further.</p><p>Dan\u2019s fists tighten at his sides and, without thinking, he marches straight to the shop\u2019s front door and yanks it open. <i>He</i> wants to be the one making Phil laugh, not some girl who probably just wants his attention because he\u2019s famous.</p><p>Determined not to look like blubbering idiot, Dan walks directly toward Phil, probably coming across more aggressive than confident. Phil spots Dan immediately and seems to say something to Sarah. She looks over her shoulder and Dan can see recognition dawn in her eyes before she quickly bolts away from Phil\u2019s table.</p><p>He really does <i>try </i>to not glare at her, but\u2026 sometimes his jealousy gets the best of him.</p><p>When Dan makes it to Phil\u2019s table, he realizes how stupid he is. He\u2019s enough of an idiot to walk into the building without a plan. Dan opens his mouth, but nothing comes out. What is he supposed to say? Why didn\u2019t he think this through? </p><p>It doesn\u2019t help with the way that Phil\u2019s looking at him; his eyes are an intense shade of blue. They\u2019re nothing like Dan\u2019s ever seen before, so sharp and daunting as he stares as Dan with his jaw slightly agape. Dan shutters slightly remembering his daydream from earlier \u2014 having him acting look at him like that sends a spark though Dan\u2019s chest. </p><p>Feeling suddenly <i>very</i> aware of his entire body, Dan focuses hard on not doing something completely embarrassing. He points to the chair, silently asking to sit. That was a completely natural and reasonable thing to do, right?</p><p>\u201cUh- oh yeah! Sit please!\u201d Phil almost shouts, eagerly moving his things aside, making room. Phil keenly smiles at Dan as his cheeks turn a light shade of red \u2013 he watches intently as Dan moves to sit. And Dan is thankful for the seat, because being around a slightly flustered Phil is enough to make Dan weak in the knees. Dan tries to relax but fails miserably \u2013 He can\u2019t help the way he holds his shoulders stiff as fidgets with the ripped material of his black jeans.  </p><p>\u201cYou seem-\u201d Dan\u2019s voice cracks slightly. He licks his lips, trying desperately not to feel flustered. He can\u2019t help it, though. Phil Lester is sitting across from him; how could he not be internally freaking out? Dan always imagined what conversations with Phil would be like, he practically rehearsed them daily, but now Dan\u2019s head is a jumbled mess.</p><p>Dan clears his throat. \u201cYou seem busy.\u201d He doesn\u2019t sound any more confident as he croaks, his words sounding like he desperately needs a glass of water.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working on my next video,\u201d Phil explains looking at his notebook. \u201cStill haven\u2019t quite figured it out yet,\u201d he mumbles, scratching his head. Dan\u2019s follows the movement, and his heart melts. From a distance, Phil had looked absolutely breathtaking, and up close \u2014 well, that\u2019s something Dan doesn\u2019t even know where to start and explain.</p><p>Dan never thought someone\u2019s skin could look so soft. He wants to reach out and trail the pads of his fingers over Phil\u2019s cheeks. Dan wants to feel every inch of Phil with his fingers, over the bridge of his nose, his smile lines, his lips. God his <i>lips</i>. They look so smooth \u2013 would they feel that way against Dan\u2019s own cracked and stress bitten ones? Would their kiss be as warm and soothing as Dan feels when Phil simply smiles at him?</p><p>Phil clears his throat and Dan realizes he\u2019s been staring. </p><p>Great, forget trying to seem confident, he\u2019s just gone straight to creepy.</p><p>\u201cIs it the same from yesterday, the Q and A? Any new ideas for it?\u201d Dan asks genuinely interested. His voice is shaky, and he tries not to let his cheeks become too flushed with embarrassment. His attempts are pointless, of course. Dan feels his cheeks warm as they turn to a rosy colour.</p><p>As much as Dan would love to marvel at how gorgeous Phil is, he needs something else to focus on because, unfortunately staring endlessly at Phil, being memorised by his smile, face, hair, and entire existence isn\u2019t the socially acceptable thing to do. Besides, Dan is still a massive fan of Phil\u2019s channel, getting the inside scoop of his next video is still a welcome distraction from the daydreaming about the gorgeous man. Though it\u2019s far less scandalous, it\u2019s still satisfying to hear about. </p><p>\u201cA few,\u201d Phil says, not sounding too confident in them.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me if you don\u2019t want to, but maybe you could bounce some ideas off me? Sometimes it helps to have another person\u2019s opinion,\u201d Dan offers. He knows what it\u2019s like to share an idea that\u2019s not completely ready, and he hates it. But Dan also knows what it\u2019s like to feel trapped in your head about something \u2014 a fresh pair of eyes really does help.</p><p>Phil takes a moment to look at his notebook \u2013 which he holds close out of Dan\u2019s sight \u2013 then at Dan. He eyes Dan with a smirk on his lips. \u201cHow do I know you won\u2019t go steal my ideas?\u201d </p><p>He\u2019s clearly joking but Dan can understand where Phil\u2019s coming from. It\u2019s not a serious question, but at the same time, it is. It\u2019s hard to trust people in the youtube industry these days.</p><p>\u201cMy lips are sealed\u201d Dan winks, \u201cand I\u2019ll tell you the plans for my next video in return.\u201d He wants to retract the arrangement he as soon as he offers it, but it\u2019s too late. When he\u2019s with Phil, he completely loses his natural filter and any sense of self-control along with it. It\u2019s maddening, really.</p><p>Phil eyes him for a moment.\u201cDeal,\u201d he agrees with a nod, looking very pleased with the bargain. </p><p>Dan watches him glance down at his still hidden notebook, like he\u2019s still contemplating the offer, then smiles to himself before sharing all the details. \u201cIt\u2019s a Q and A video, like I told you yesterday\u2026\u201d He thinks for a moment, concentrating on his notes, then back to Dan with a little more confidence. \u201cBut I was thinking about doing it with another person there, like another youtuber asks me the questions, or maybe a friend?\u201d He explains, the concentration still very clear. He takes a sip of his coffee, brows furrowed like he\u2019s still thinking, so Dan waits until he continues, not wanting to interrupt Phils thought process.</p><p>Phil bites his lip, hesitating before he continues. \u201cI just don\u2019t want it to be boring, it needs something else, but I just don\u2019t know <i>what</i>.\u201d Phil sighs, beginning to sounds a little discouraged. \u201cEverything I come up with is ridiculous and stupid.\u201d He frowns, leaning back in his chair.</p><p>Dan tilts his head to the side smiling slightly as he fully registers what Phil is saying, and it all makes his heart fill to the point that his chest \u2013 as cheesy as it is \u2013 might explode. Dan could tell from watching Phil in his videos that he\u2019s passionate about what he does, but seeing it in action, seeing him so worked up about what it loves\u2026 It\u2019s enough make even Dan feel inspired. The man is just so genuine in what he does, maybe the whole youtube world isn\u2019t as shallow as Dan constantly assumes it is?</p><p>Dan swallows and finally responds. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound stupid to me. It sounds like you really care about your work. That in and of itself is enough to make a video interesting to watch,\u201d Dan assures Phil. <i>Where the hell is this positivity coming from?</i> \u201cThe fact that you\u2019re putting this much energy into it means its bound to be good. Besides I think it\u2019s a cool idea to have another person involved in the video.\u201d Seriously, when did Dan become this sparking ray of sunshine? Dan care barely muster the mindset to get out of bed in the morning? What is Phil doing to him? </p><p>The weird part is, Dan<i> actually </i>means every word he\u2019s saying.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I just feel like like the whole Q and A thing is so overdone, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Phil asks defeatedly, tapping his pencil on the table.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re overthinking it. Isn\u2019t that supposed to be my thing? Are you coming for my brand?\u201d Dan jokes, chuckling at the way Phil rolls his eyes in response. </p><p>\u201cSpeaking of your <i>brand</i>,\u201d Phil teases, \u201cI believe you owe me a sneak peek into Daniel Howell\u2019s next video.\u201d Phil looks him directly in the eye and Dan shivers at the use of his full name. It\u2019s hot, and it sounds really fucking good in Phil\u2019s voice. He has to take a moment not to jump Phil then and there. Christ, his younger self might have.</p><p>Phil looks at him with a questioning smirk, like he can read Dan\u2019s very terribly concealed  reaction to his words. Dan can feel his skin flush hot, and he jumps slightly when someone comes up to their table. It\u2019s that damn girl who seems to think 2009 emo is still a thing. Dan clenches his jaw, forcing himself not to make a sarcastic comment. </p><p>\u201cCan I get you anything?\u201d She asks flatly, staring at Dan. In her hands, she holds what looks like a torn scrap piece of paper and pen.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know this place did table service,\u201d Phil asks through his teeth, sounding annoyed as he looks at her in a way that doesn\u2019t scream friendly.</p><p>It\u2019s terrible, but it does makes Dan feel slightly better. Seeing Phil unimpressed with her is better than seeing them flirt.</p><p>\u201cWe do now,\u201d she snaps, turning to Dan. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she says sounding annoyed. </p><p>Dan furrows his brows, his gaze flitting back and forth between Sarah and Phil. Is she purposefully trying to interrupt them? Is <i>she</i> jealous? The thought pleases Dan. If she\u2019s jealous, that means there\u2019s something between him and Phil to be <i>jealous of.</i> On second thought, is Dan happy about that? Because that sounds awfully terrifying and real.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want anything.\u201d Dan remarks sassily and considers adding \u2018from you\u2019 to the sentence, but decides that might be a little too much sass. So instead he glares at her, willing her to walk away in his mind.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she scoffs, eyeing Dan like she doesn\u2019t believe him. For a second, she hovers before she spins on her heel back to the cashier where she barks an order at one of her co-workers.</p><p>Looks like Dan\u2019s will power worked for once.</p><p>\u201cYou get used to her,\u201d Phil reassures Dan. \u201cShe can be nice, I swear.  Look at this!\u201d Phil shows Dan the half sunken in, frothy Pikachu \u2014 the latte art that Dan already saw online, because he has a problem when it comes to stalking Phils social media.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I saw that on your Instagram when I was standing outsi- when I was walking here.\u201d Dan hasty corrects himself, almost blowing his cover that he\u2019s not a complete freak who avidly checks Phils instagram, and stands outside coffee shops for an embarrassing amount of time before actually go in to see him. Thankfully, Phil doesn\u2019t seem to catch on.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it adorable?\u201d Phil smiles, staring at the cup. Dan absolutely melts at the man\u2019s fondness for something as simple as themed latte art.</p><p>\u201cIt is, though probably a bit weird when you started sipping away Pikachu\u2019s face,\u201d Dan laughs slightly when Phil tilts his head to the side, realizing the damage he\u2019s done to poor Pikachu.</p><p>Phil looks at the cup then back at Dan, \u201cI didn\u2019t think about that.\u201d He chuckles, then playfully grimaces when he puts the cup down.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve crippled him for life Phil.\u201d Dean teases through a grin. \u201cHe\u2019ll never be the same.\u201d Dan adds, theatrically putting his hand on his heart and looks off into the distance.</p><p>Phil looks half traumatized, and half like he\u2019s trying not to laugh as he turns the deformed Pikachu away from him. \u201cI can\u2019t look him in the face, not anymore,\u201d Phil says dramatically.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Because he doesn\u2019t have one,\u201d Dan giggles and Phil can\u2019t hold back his laugh either. How is joking around with Phil so damn easy? Usually it takes Dan <i>weeks</i> to warm up to a person like he has to Phil.</p><p>Phil pretends to look shocked while giggling a little. \u201cDon\u2019t make it worse! I feel guilty enough as it is.\u201d Phil jokingly pleads, unable to hide his smile as he leans his notebook on the cup blocking it from his view.</p><p>Dan\u2019s eye catches a few words on the notebook, two of them jumping out and Dan immediately begins to sweat with anxiety.</p><p><i>Daniel Howell.</i></p><p>Is that Dan\u2019s name? Why the hell is his name there? Dan\u2019s mind desperately tries to imagine what purpose Phil could possibly have for his name being there. And worse, the sentences around Dan\u2019s name aren\u2019t helpful in any way and are basically a blur in Dan\u2019s panic, so they don\u2019t give him any clues. Is Phil planning on talking about Dan in his next video? Does he plan on telling his followers he\u2019s found his soulmate?</p><p>That he\u2019s found <i>Dan</i>?</p><p>Dan skin feels hot and his chest begins to prickle in a very unpleasant way. Is it him, or did this coffee shop used to be bigger before? The walls certainly seem a lot closer than he remembers. </p><p>Dan\u2019s not ready for any of this. He\u2019s not ready for the world to know. Feeling sick, he tries to read more of the notebook, looking for any details of what Phil has planned.</p><p>Phil quickly pulls back the notebook when he notices where Dan\u2019s eyes have landed. His gaze snaps up to Dan\u2019s, almost looking as panicked as Dan feels.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell anyone,\u201d Phil quickly blurts out. \u201cIt\u2019s just, I got a lot of questions about you!\u201d His words are quick, like he\u2019s trying to explain before Dan runs. \u201cI thought it would be weird if I didn\u2019t answer one. Considering about 80% of them were about you.\u201d he says panicked, clearly trying to explain himself. \u201cOur radio show really got people excited!\u201d Phil turns his notebook toward Dan and places it on the table in front of him. He points to one of the sentences near Dan\u2019s name.</p><p><b>What was it like having Dan on your radio show?!?!?! - @phillysgirl</b></p><p>It helps a little when Dan reads more, and all the questions Phil chose about him are relatively surface level. When he reaches the bottom though, Dan\u2019s cheeks flush. This ones a little cheeky.</p><p><b>Dan is one sexy man in his videos, does the same go for real life? - @Jessicab</b></p><p>\u201cI think the appropriate answer for the last question is yes.\u201d Dan nervously laughs, feeling his body become a little less tense. </p><p>Phil\u2019s eyes widen (he must have forgot about that last one) and he grabs his notebook back, closing it so the green cover faces up. \u201cAgreed.\u201d He laughs half heartedly.</p><p>Dan can tell Phil\u2019s trying not to scare him. And don\u2019t get Dan wrong, he wants nothing more than to run. To go back to his flat and pretend like the entire last month didn\u2019t happen. But he can\u2019t. He needs to know <i>for sure</i> that Phil won\u2019t tell anyone. He needs to be able to trust that Phil won\u2019t tell. But can Dan do that?</p><p>Once again, Dan is riddled with the knowledge that, as much as it feels like it, Dan doesn\u2019t <i>really </i>know who Phil is. He\u2019s a complete stranger. He could just be another youtuber out for the fame and nothing else \u2013 having Dan as his soulmate would only skyrocket his youtube channel further. People love drama, especially when romance and soulmates are involved.</p><p>Dan bites his lip so hard he tastes a hint of blood. \u201cI want to believe that you won\u2019t tell anyone, but how? I\u2019ve watched your videos, I know the person you show to the world. But I don\u2019t know<i> you</i>.\u201d Dan\u2019s tries to keep his voice even and professional, and he almost does until it wavers at the end.</p><p>Phils eyes soften at Dan\u2019s honesty; he seems a shocked at how open Dan is being. Phil leans forward, as if to show Dan that he has his full attention.  \u201cWell I can\u2019t say the person I show online is completely who I am, but give me a chance to show you that you can trust me.\u201d Phil is gentle, he\u2019s trying desperately not to scare Dan. \u201cI promise this isn\u2019t all a joke to me.\u201d he continues seriously, looking Dan directly in the eyes. \u201cBesides, I haven\u2019t told anyone yet have I? And it\u2019s been over a month since we\u2026\u201d Phil trails off, reflecting on the memory of their meeting. \u201cThough, it probably would have made an interesting tweet.\u201d Phil laughs awkwardly. \u201cJust met my soulmate, he ran away from me.\u201d Phil mocks Dan playfully.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2013 I didn\u2019t <i>run</i>, I haven\u2019t <i>run</i> in years,\u201d Dan defends himself, trying not to crack a small smile.</p><p>\u201cYou ran,\u201d Phil says matter of factly.</p><p>Yes, he definitely ran. Like a frightened child.</p><p>They sit in silence for a moment, just long enough for Dan to try and digest what is happening. How can they go from something serious to joking around so easily?</p><p>\u201cYou like Mario Kart?\u201d Phil pipes up, raising a brow.</p><p>\u201cOnly a crazy person would say no,\u201d Dan scoffs dramatically.</p><p>\u201cWant to come to mine and play a few rounds?\u201d Phil asks, sounding like he\u2019s trying not to be <i>too</i> hopeful.</p><p>Dan sighs and looks at Phil, studying the man intensely. He wants to go, but it feels like saying yes will open the floodgates to something Dan isn\u2019t ready for. If he says yes to this, Phil might be encouraged to invite Dan over more often. Or invite Dan <i>out</i>, even.</p><p>Is that a bad thing?</p><p>\u201cHow else are you supposed to learn to trust me, if you don\u2019t take the chance to get to know me?\u201d Phil needles, still managing to not come off <i>too</i> forward. But maybe forward is exactly the push Dan needs.</p><p>\u201cI not sure\u2026\u201d Dan\u2019s about to say no, but the disappointed frown Phil is already showing is too much for Dan to bare. Dan swallows thickly, and closes his eyes for a fraction of a second before looking back at Phil. \u201cAlright, a couple rounds won\u2019t hurt,\u201d Dan reluctantly agrees, and when Phil\u2019s eyes flare with excitement, Dan knows it\u2019s worth the anxiety.</p><p>\u201cGreat! My flat\u2019s about a fifteen-ish minute walk.\u201d Phil quickly begins to pack up his things, as if not wanting to give Dan the chance to back out.</p><p>Dan didn\u2019t bring much with his aside from his phone, so he stands up and waits for Phil to put everything in his backpack. Dan watches tentatively, savouring the small moment. It\u2019s strange seeing someone usually seen on the other side of a computer screen in real life. Dan\u2019s so used to seeing Phil from a certain angle \u2013 he watches Phil bring his plate and half full cup to the counter, and it feels <i>strange</i>. It\u2019s a good strange, though. Dan gets to see an unscripted part of him that few others get to see.</p><p>Who knew Dan could be so mesmerized by the back of someone\u2019s head?</p><p>Dan watches him make a comment to Sarah which actually makes her laugh, something Dan has yet to see her do since he walked into the shop \u2014 and any other encounter he\u2019s had with her, really.</p><p>Phil turns toward Dan and starts in his direction, \u201cReady?\u201d he asks, holding the door open for Dan.</p><p>As they first begin their walk, it\u2019s silent, but not the type of silence where Dan desperately tries to find a subject or make a sarcastic comment to fill the silence. But a silence that feels comfortable, natural even. They walk side by side, but now that Dan\u2019s made himself aware of the silence, he can\u2019t help but say something to break it.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Dan trials off realizing he didn\u2019t actually come up with anything to say. \u201cWhy amazingphil?\u201d Dan asks, quickly trying to recover. He looks curiously a Phil, pretty sure he knows the answer but still wonders \u2013 was he simply trying to be funny, or is he actually <i>that</i> clever?</p><p>\u201cWell, I could tell you,\u201d Phil smirks cheekily. \u201cBut then all my mystery and charm would be gone,\u201d he teases, sneaking a glance at Dan from the corner of his eye. He looks absolutely marvelous, and Dan nearly forgets how to breathe. The red stoplight from across the street elicits a red hue against Phil\u2019s skin, and bounces off the darkness of his hair, creating a red glow behind him.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s impossible.\u201d Dan breaths, slightly caught up in how stunning Phil is. Dan clears his throat, pretending he wasn\u2019t staring.</p><p>\u201cWhy the change from danisnotonfire, to Daniel Howell?\u201d Phil asks. Though if he\u2019s seen Dan\u2019s videos, he knows exactly why - Dan had explained it when he made the change. Maybe Phil was lying about seeing his video. Phil continues on before Dan has the chance to be disappointed, though. \u201cI mean I know<i> why</i>, but I want to know why exactly?\u201d Phil answers Dan\u2019s question. \u201cLike, what lead to the change?\u201d</p><p>Dan ponders the question for a moment. \u201cIt was time,\u201d Dan says finally. \u201cDanisnotonfire represents a different me. It was someone who was afraid to be themselves, but Daniel Howell on the other hand, he\u2019s working on living his truth.\u201d Dan says with more confidence than he expects. Sure he\u2019s said these things to a camera before, but never to a human person (that\u2019s not his therapist), that always seemed way to terrifying. He\u2019s not sure why he\u2019s being so honest with Phil. He can barely talk to Anne about this stuff, but here he is, telling someone who is practically a stranger.</p><p>\u201cDoes Daniel Howell always talk about himself in the third person?\u201d Phil chuckles, smiling fondly.</p><p>\u201cOnly when he\u2019s trying to dissociate himself from the serious and heavy shit in life,\u201d Dan jokes, looking at his feet as his cheeks colour with a blush.</p><p>\u201cThat seems healthy.\u201d Phil bumps Dan with his shoulder. \u201cThis is me.\u201d He points to a building that is significantly nicer than Dan\u2019s. Brick lines the exterior, leading up to at least five floors. Phil opens the glass door, leading to the entranceway. Dan takes note of the white marble walls as they make their way to the elevator, they\u2019d be perfect for his Instagram aesthetic. Which Dan knows is a terrible thing to come to mind immediately, but hey social media is literally his career. He can\u2019t help it.   </p><p>\u201cFancy,\u201d Dan remarks sarcastically, feeling a little intimidated. Dan knows Phil isn\u2019t hurting financially, between the popularity of his youtube channel and the radio show. Still, Dan can\u2019t help feeling a tad inadequate. Does this sort of stuff matter to Phil?</p><p>\u201cTrust me, it\u2019s not that fancy, wait until you actually see my flat. It\u2019s definitely due for some repairs.\u201d Phil assures Dan, pressing the button to floor five.</p><p>They step out into a narrow hall and stop at the first door on the left. Dan watches Phil open the door but doesn\u2019t follow him inside. Instead, he stands outside, hesitantly rocking from foot to foot. Facing the entrance of Phil\u2019s flat feels symbolic for some reason. Coming to Phil\u2019s place, laughing with him, talking to him, and not wanting the day to end. It\u2019s surreal.</p><p>Dan had literally spent a good chunk if his late teens \u2013 hell, his adulthood \u2013 dreaming of this exact scenario. And now, it\u2019s really happening.</p><p>How the<i> fuck</i> did Dan get here?</p><p>He\u2019s torn between excitement and resentment. Dan knows their banter and teasing is all fabricated, but a small part of him wishes it wasn\u2019t. Dan may have daydreamed about being Phil\u2019s soulmate, but he never actually <i>wanted</i> it to happen. If Dan had gotten to know Phil without the soulmate bullshit, he hoped it would have been because Phil is actually interested in Dan and his work, not out of obligation.</p><p>Dan is standing outside the home of the man of his dreams for all the wrong reasons. He\u2019s only here because the universe is telling Phil this is how it\u2019s supposed to be. But Dan hasn\u2019t been brainwashed to believe it like Phil.</p><p>Dan knows the truth - that soulmates are bullshit. And it leaves a small aching hole in his heart.</p><p>How is Dan supposed to know Phil <i>actually</i> wants him here? Did Phil only suggest he come over because they\u2019re soulmates? Does Phil really like having Dan around, or does he like the idea of him? The idea of being a part of an elite group of those who\u2019ve found the person they\u2019re supposed to spend the rest of their life with.</p><p>\u201cYou coming inside?\u201d Phil awkwardly chuckles, looking at Dan curiously.</p><p>\u201cYea, sorry,\u201d Dan mumbles, hesitant as he steps through the doorway. He\u2019s holding his breath as if waiting for something bad to happen, and when it doesn\u2019t, he exhales.</p><p>Maybe staying for an hour or so wouldn\u2019t hurt?</p><p>Dan shuts the door behind him and when he does, he hears a thump come from somewhere in the flat.</p><p>\u201cAlways so graceful she is,\u201d Phil sighs and turns toward the end of the hall. \u201cDo you want a drink?\u201d Phil offers with a shy smile, gesturing for Dan to follow him. \u201cOr tea?\u201d He asks over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cA drink is perfect,\u201d Dan says a little too eagerly, and follows Phil down the narrow hallway deeper into Phil\u2019s flat. The small hallway is relatively bare, aside from a plant, which has probably seen better days, placed near the door of Phil\u2019s kitchen. A sense of satisfaction comes to Dan knowing that the silly part of Phil he portrays about his inability to keep houseplants alive is true. Dan chuckles to himself. He knows it\u2019s common knowledge to Phil\u2019s followers, but seeing it in person makes Dan feel special somehow.</p><p>Phil follows Dan\u2019s eye to the poor plant. \u201cI kept it alive for quite a while!\u201d he defends himself while holding back a smile, clearly pretending to be serious. They walk into the kitchen, which is definitely bigger than Dan\u2019s, not to mention a lot more colourful, and Dan sees a row of small cacti along the backside of the counter. Of the five that live - or, well, <i>sit</i> - there, only one still resembles something close to the colour green.</p><p>\u201cJesus Phil,\u201d Dan laughs, \u201cYou don\u2019t even have to water a cactus that much, and you\u2019ve still managed to kill more than half of them,\u201d he teases, pointing to the unfortunate casualties. \u201cYou really weren\u2019t joking?\u201d Dan turns to Phil notices his slightly blushed cheeks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault! They just die! It\u2019s like I\u2019m cursed!\u201d Phil exclaims in defence as he grabs two wine glasses from one of his cupboards.</p><p>From around the corner, little patters of feet come bolting through the flat. Dan looks to Phil, who doesn\u2019t seem at all alarmed by the noise, and then back toward the opening to the far side of the kitchen. A small but absolutely adorable corgi comes zooming around the corner, with such speed it almost runs right into the wall.</p><p>Phil has a dog?</p><p>\u201cYou have a dog?\u201d Dan asks dumbfounded. Phil has <i>never</i> mentioned anything about a dog on his channel. Why has he never mentioned it? Dan\u2019s stomach knots, there\u2019s so much he doesn\u2019t know about Phil.</p><p>\u201cYes! Dan meet Nala, Nala meet Dan.\u201d Phil smiles down at the dog, as if hiding the fact that he has a dog - something that would probably get him loads of views, honestly - from his fans is a completely normal thing to do.</p><p>\u201cAnd why does no one know about this precious doggo?\u201d Dan asks genuinely shocked. But of course, Dan\u2019s confusion doesn\u2019t stop him from leaning down and petting the precious thing, she wags her tail, looking up at Dan and seeming satisfied by Dan\u2019s pets.</p><p>\u201cI really haven\u2019t had her that long, only about six months. I plan on introducing her to my viewers, just haven\u2019t gotten around to it yet,\u201d Phil explains, shrugging slightly. \u201cEvery time I think about it, I just get too distracted by how adorable she is and we end up playing or napping.\u201d Phil continues pouring white wine into their glasses. After, he hands Dan a bag of treats from one of the drawers.</p><p>\u201cWell, that is absolutely valid.\u201d Dan smiles down at the dog, sitting on the floor as he uses his baby voice to address her. \u201cYou are so cute Nala, yes you are.\u201d He feeds her a treat, and then two, and then two more. \u201cOkay, I better stop before you eat them all.\u201d Dan stands up, his heartbreaking at the disappointed look Nala gives him as she starts to wine.</p><p>Unable to help the smile on his face Dan looks to Phil, who is staring at Dan in a way that makes Dan\u2019s chest flutter. Phil looks absolutely mesmerized as he fondly smiles at the two of them. Dan clears his throat, making Phil go a very dark shade of red. </p><p>Phil rolls his eyes, pretending what just happened, didn\u2019t happen. \u201cShe\u2019s so dramatic, I swear,\u201d Phil says, sounding a bit fond still.  He then looks at the dog matter of factly, \u201cNala, you already had dinner today stop complaining.\u201d He\u2019s stern yet playful. \u201cEverything is set up in the lounge.\u201d Phil hands Dan his wine and gestures for him to follow him through the doorway where Nala had come bolting from.</p><p>There\u2019s a TV set up at the opposite end of the room, placed above a fireplace. </p><p>What Dan wouldn\u2019t give to have a fireplace.</p><p>They make their way to the couch, and Dan sits down on the completely opposite side of the sofa to Phil. Nala quickly follows suit, jumping up between them on the couch, thankfully making the space between them a little less obvious. Feeling nervous about being in Phils space, Dan takes a couple generous gulps of wine, then places his glass on the coffee table beside Phil\u2019s. </p><p>\u201cAlright, get ready for defeat.\u201d Phil taunts, powering up the game.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s confident. Enjoy it while you can, it won\u2019t last long.\u201d Dan bants back, taking the controller Phil hands him. Dan quickly checks his phone when he feels it vibrate in his pocket. Anne is texting him, but she can wait. He puts the phone on the table, focusing back to the game. They speed through selecting their players and carts, clearly each having a standard go-to, and dive right into the game.   </p><p>Dan wins. And wins and wins and wins. And then Phil <i>almost</i> wins, but Dan wins again. Every time they end a round, Phil somehow convinces Dan to start another, claiming he\u2019s just warming up. </p><p>\u201cOh sure, you just don\u2019t know when to quit,\u201d Dan teases starting the race again, which of course <i>he wins</i>.</p><p>\u201cHA!\u201d Dan shouts, probably far too loud for how late it is \u2013 hopefully Phil\u2019s walls aren\u2019t too thin. Nala makes her annoyance clear as she jumps off the couch and moves to the dog bed beside the television.</p><p>\u201cSee, told you,\u201d Dan continues, his volume a little more under control. \u201cI am the Mario Kart champion, no one can beat me.\u201d He smirks, putting his controller down on the coffee table and turning on the couch to face Phil. He\u2019s looking at Dan with the fondest smile, strange for someone who just lost nine times in a row.</p><p>\u201cLook it\u2019s not over yet. I could still have a few tricks up my sleeves.\u201d Phil confidently crosses his arms over his chest eyeing Dan.</p><p>\u201cSure, keep telling yourself that.\u201d Dan teases sarcastically, all while holding back a giggle, and instead rolling his eyes playfully.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to rematch another day, after I\u2019ve had time to perfect my skills.\u201d Phil tries to defend himself.</p><p>Remembering his wine, Dan leans forward to grab it, the cuff his sleeve riding up in the process of reaching for the glass. Dan freezes midway to the table, and he hears Phil\u2019s breath hitch. Dan looks overs and sees that Phil\u2019s eyes are boring into him. Following Phil\u2019s intense stare, Dan shifts his gaze to his wrist - his <i>nearly</i> <i>exposed</i> - wrist, and is starkly reminded of the name written there.</p><p>Dan puts the glass back on the table and nervously pulls his sleeves down. It takes him a moment to meet Phil\u2019s gaze. Dan had almost forgotten, he\u2019d almost let himself pretend the situation, their <i>friendship</i>, or whatever it is, isn\u2019t completely <i>fucked.</i></p><p>Phil swallows, and Dan watches his adam\u2019s apple bob. He clears his throat. \u201cCan I\u2026\u201d Phil trails off quietly, his hand on the couch inching towards Dan. </p><p>Dan can practically see the internal battle Phil is having with himself. </p><p>\u201cCan I see it?\u201d Phil gently asks, putting his own controller down to turn and face Dan more directly.</p><p>Dan\u2019s mouth goes dry.</p><p>The way Phil\u2019s looking at him pumps Dan full with anxiety. The desperation is clear, Phil wants things from Dan than Dan isn\u2019t sure he can give. But still, this is something Dan can give him. It couldn\u2019t hurt, right?</p><p>Dan pulls up his sleeve slightly, exposing his pale flesh where Phil\u2019s name is permanently tattooed into his skin.</p><p>Phil sucks in when he sees it. He reaches out but pulls his hand back immediately. Dan watches Phil intently. He watches the way Phil flexes his jaw, and holds his fist tight, forcing himself to keep his hands steady.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Dan says quietly, moving his wrist closer to Phil, silently telling him he can touch.</p><p>Phil looks at him surprised. \u201cYou sure?\u201d He asks softly, genuinely seeming to want Dan\u2019s permission.</p><p>\u201cYe- Yeah.\u201d Dan stutters, holding his breath.</p><p>Phil reaches out, but doesn\u2019t touch the raised skin with black letters first. Instead, he gently wraps his hand around Dan\u2019s wrist and lightly pulls it closer to his own body. Dan shivers, savouring the feeling of Phil\u2019s skin on his.</p><p>Dan shuffles closer so he doesn\u2019t have to awkwardly lean across the space between them. His knee rests in front of him on the couch and tingles where it touches Phil\u2019s thigh, even through the fabric of their jeans.</p><p>Dan feels restless as he watches Phil inspect the tattoo. Turning his head to the side curiously, Phil thumbs his finger over the name on Dan\u2019s skin. A rush of desire floods Dan\u2019s body and he finds himself leaning forward, his breath coming out heavy, matching Phil\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s strange,\u201d Phil breathes, furrowing his brow in concentration as he inspects the letters.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Dan clears his throat, lost in the moment. The sound of his own voice snaps him out of it and he quickly retracts his hand from Phil\u2019s. Immediately, he misses the warmth of Phil\u2019s palm. \u201cSorry,\u201d Dan apologizes for no particular reason and quickly stands up. \u201cI should go.\u201d Dan quickly mumbles, looking at the clock hanging on the wall. </p><p>How the hell is it already one in the morning.</p><p>\u201cOh, uh\u2026\u201d Phil begins, clearing his throat, he\u2019s about to say more but Dan is already out of sight, heading straight for the door. Dan winces when he slams it shut behind him, not expecting the loud bang when it hits the frame. But, it doesn\u2019t stop Dan from taking the stairs down two at a time to the lobby, too impatient to wait for the elevator. Too afraid that Phil would chase after him, Dan\u2019s pace quickens at the thought.</p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t stop walking until he makes it back to his flat, a walk that should have taken twenty minutes, he does in only seven. Probably the most vigorous physical activity Dan has done in months.</p><p>When he finally unlocks his door after three tries, Dan goes straight for the couch and flops onto the cushions, face first in his favourite fluffy pillow. </p><p>Things got way too personal.</p><p>He\u2019s such an idiot. How did he let the night get that far? Everything had been fine, fun even, until Phil had to go and make things serious.</p><p>Dan reaches for his pocket needing a distraction, but when he pats down his clothing he notices something vital missing.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\u201d Dan curses himself. He scrunches his eyes closed and looks up at the ceiling in defeat and lets out a long sigh.</p><p>He left his phone at Phil\u2019s place.</p>",
                "content": "<p><b>Summary:</b> Dan doesn&rsquo;t believe in soulmates, or at least that&rsquo;s what he tells himself when he looks down at the numbers on his arm. He just can&rsquo;t believe in system the dictates the direction of his life before he even has a say in the matter. The timer on Dan&rsquo;s arm counts down to the second that Dan will meet his soulmate, and despite his utter reluctance and dread for the moment to come, he almost finds himself happy it does. He might not have imagined it would happen the way it does, but he just can&rsquo;t help but feel something for the mysterious man named Philip Lester. And that&rsquo;s a major problem.<br /></p><p><b>Soulmates AU</b></p><p><a href=\"https://embracedthevoid.tumblr.com/post/182797137139/everylittlethingch3\" target=\"_blank\">Read Chapter Three</a></p><p><b>Word Count:</b> 6.7k <b>Chapter:</b> 3/? <b>Rating:</b> T</p><p><b>a/n: </b>As per usual I have to thank <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRIDDPkl1a7wWNj29b8okpQ\" target=\"_blank\">@imnotinclinedtomaturity</a> for being an amazing beta.

When he peeks his head around, he can see Phil sat at his usual spot through the smudged glass window and his heart begins pounding.</p><p>Beside his computer, Phil has his notebook open in front of him. He leans forward to scribble something onto the paper, making his glasses fall to the bridge of his nose. He pushes them back into place, and then runs his hands through his quiff, forcing it slightly askew. He&rsquo;s concentrating  so hard on his work that lines on his forehead have started indent his skin.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He looks <i>so</i> serious.&nbsp;</p><p>Dan imagines Phil looking at him like <i>that</i>, over his glasses with the stern look he has right now. Perhaps Phil&rsquo;s blue eyes would darken to something deeper, the thought only makes Dan mind wander</p><p>Dan pictures them alone in his flat with a finished bottle of wine, which was shared between the two of them, abandoned on the coffee table. Dan would bite his lip, the liquid courage making things easier; he&rsquo;d lean forward on the couch inching closer to Phil, feeling Phil&rsquo;s breath light on his skin because they&rsquo;re so close. Dan&rsquo;s hands find their way onto the denim material covering Phil&rsquo;s thigh, they slide up as their lips touch and&ndash;</p><p>Someone sneezes as they walk past Dan, yanking him out of his daydream.</p><p>Swallowing down his desire, Dan tries to focus on Phil and actually muster up the courage to talk to the man. But Dan falters when he sees Phil open his phone and snap a picture of his coffee cup. Dan watches him review the photo then move the cup slightly to take another photo. This time he seems pleased; the corner of his mouth turns up slightly as he tilts his head to the side. His fingers tap away at the screen and Dan&rsquo;s chest flutters.</p><p>How can Phil go from making Dan want to rip his clothes off, to an adorable dork that he wants to hug, in just seconds?</p><p>It&rsquo;s <i>completely</i> unfair.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s phone buzzes in his pocket. He pulls it out and unlocks it to see that Phil Lester has posted to his Instagram story. Dan chuckles to himself, knowing the process that lead to the notification, and how adorable Phil is. Dan taps on the circle, opening the story to reveal a picture of Phil&rsquo;s coffee with multiple flashy stickers surrounding it. At the bottom, the image reads &lsquo;Wow! Sarah, the magical barista put Pikachu in my cup!&rsquo;. And of course, there is an adorable Pikachu made in the froth of Phil&rsquo;s caramel macchiato, which dan can only assume is what Phil is drinking.</p><p>Dan squeezes his phone a little too tight. An ugly surge of jealousy knots in his stomach, same as the day he walked in on Phil and the barista &ndash; who Dan now knows is Sarah &ndash; giggling together. He&rsquo;s not sure what came over him that day, he&rsquo;d been working so hard on feeling indifferent to the whole <i>Phil and soulmates situation</i>. But when he saw them together, Dan snapped. He wasn&rsquo;t sure if they&rsquo;d been flirting or not, but even the idea makes Dan nauseous.</p><p>Groaning, Dan leans away from the window, resting against the side of the building. He shouldn&rsquo;t care. </p><p>But he <i>does</i>.</p><p>Of course Dan had to complicate things further when he actually sat down with Phil the last time he saw him. Sure, it wasn&rsquo;t as terribly awkward as Dan imagined, but he almost wished it had been. Then maybe he&rsquo;d be able to say with confidence that the universe got it wrong, and that they&rsquo;re completely opposite people and <i>nothing</i> alike.</p><p>Except, that they have<i> everything</i> in common &mdash; Dan knows from just watching Phil&rsquo;s videos over the years that they&rsquo;re perfect for each other. Hell, Dan doesn&rsquo;t remember a time when he didn&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d get on well if they knew each other in real life.</p><p>Still, the things Phil shares on his channel are all superficial. Dan has yet to spend any actual time with Phil. He only knows the Phil that he portrays through his social media, Dan doesn&rsquo;t know the hidden version of Phil. Maybe that&rsquo;s where they&rsquo;ll clash. Aside from their small conversation yesterday, Phil only knows the persona Dan has assumed through his own youtube channel. Yesterday Dan was being himself, but the situation was still tense. Maybe once Phil gets to know who Dan really is, he won&rsquo;t be so eager when Dan walks through the door.</p><p>There&rsquo;s movement at Phil&rsquo;s table, grabbing Dan&rsquo;s attention. That <i>Sarah</i> girl is leaning against the back of the chair across from Phil. She says something to make Phil laugh, and Dan quickly reminded of how much this girl gets under his skin.</p><p>Dan imagines the annoyingly pretty girl sitting down, and Phil looking at <i>her </i>over his glasses in in that dreamy way. It&rsquo;s enough to agitate Dan further.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s fists tighten at his sides and, without thinking, he marches straight to the shop&rsquo;s front door and yanks it open. <i>He</i> wants to be the one making Phil laugh, not some girl who probably just wants his attention because he&rsquo;s famous.</p><p>Determined not to look like blubbering idiot, Dan walks directly toward Phil, probably coming across more aggressive than confident. Phil spots Dan immediately and seems to say something to Sarah. She looks over her shoulder and Dan can see recognition dawn in her eyes before she quickly bolts away from Phil&rsquo;s table.</p><p>He really does <i>try </i>to not glare at her, but&hellip; sometimes his jealousy gets the best of him.</p><p>When Dan makes it to Phil&rsquo;s table, he realizes how stupid he is. He&rsquo;s enough of an idiot to walk into the building without a plan. Dan opens his mouth, but nothing comes out. What is he supposed to say? Why didn&rsquo;t he think this through? </p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t help with the way that Phil&rsquo;s looking at him; his eyes are an intense shade of blue. They&rsquo;re nothing like Dan&rsquo;s ever seen before, so sharp and daunting as he stares as Dan with his jaw slightly agape. Dan shutters slightly remembering his daydream from earlier &mdash; having him acting look at him like that sends a spark though Dan&rsquo;s chest. </p><p>Feeling suddenly <i>very</i> aware of his entire body, Dan focuses hard on not doing something completely embarrassing. He points to the chair, silently asking to sit. That was a completely natural and reasonable thing to do, right?</p><p>&ldquo;Uh- oh yeah! Sit please!&rdquo; Phil almost shouts, eagerly moving his things aside, making room. Phil keenly smiles at Dan as his cheeks turn a light shade of red &ndash; he watches intently as Dan moves to sit. And Dan is thankful for the seat, because being around a slightly flustered Phil is enough to make Dan weak in the knees. Dan tries to relax but fails miserably &ndash; He can&rsquo;t help the way he holds his shoulders stiff as fidgets with the ripped material of his black jeans.  </p><p>&ldquo;You seem-&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s voice cracks slightly. He licks his lips, trying desperately not to feel flustered. He can&rsquo;t help it, though. Phil Lester is sitting across from him; how could he not be internally freaking out? Dan always imagined what conversations with Phil would be like, he practically rehearsed them daily, but now Dan&rsquo;s head is a jumbled mess.</p><p>Dan clears his throat. &ldquo;You seem busy.&rdquo; He doesn&rsquo;t sound any more confident as he croaks, his words sounding like he desperately needs a glass of water.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m working on my next video,&rdquo; Phil explains looking at his notebook. &ldquo;Still haven&rsquo;t quite figured it out yet,&rdquo; he mumbles, scratching his head. Dan&rsquo;s follows the movement, and his heart melts. From a distance, Phil had looked absolutely breathtaking, and up close &mdash; well, that&rsquo;s something Dan doesn&rsquo;t even know where to start and explain.</p><p>Dan never thought someone&rsquo;s skin could look so soft. He wants to reach out and trail the pads of his fingers over Phil&rsquo;s cheeks. Dan wants to feel every inch of Phil with his fingers, over the bridge of his nose, his smile lines, his lips. God his <i>lips</i>. They look so smooth &ndash; would they feel that way against Dan&rsquo;s own cracked and stress bitten ones? Would their kiss be as warm and soothing as Dan feels when Phil simply smiles at him?</p><p>Phil clears his throat and Dan realizes he&rsquo;s been staring. </p><p>Great, forget trying to seem confident, he&rsquo;s just gone straight to creepy.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it the same from yesterday, the Q and A? Any new ideas for it?&rdquo; Dan asks genuinely interested. His voice is shaky, and he tries not to let his cheeks become too flushed with embarrassment. His attempts are pointless, of course. Dan feels his cheeks warm as they turn to a rosy colour.</p><p>As much as Dan would love to marvel at how gorgeous Phil is, he needs something else to focus on because, unfortunately staring endlessly at Phil, being memorised by his smile, face, hair, and entire existence isn&rsquo;t the socially acceptable thing to do. Besides, Dan is still a massive fan of Phil&rsquo;s channel, getting the inside scoop of his next video is still a welcome distraction from the daydreaming about the gorgeous man. Though it&rsquo;s far less scandalous, it&rsquo;s still satisfying to hear about. </p><p>&ldquo;A few,&rdquo; Phil says, not sounding too confident in them.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to tell me if you don&rsquo;t want to, but maybe you could bounce some ideas off me? Sometimes it helps to have another person&rsquo;s opinion,&rdquo; Dan offers. He knows what it&rsquo;s like to share an idea that&rsquo;s not completely ready, and he hates it. But Dan also knows what it&rsquo;s like to feel trapped in your head about something &mdash; a fresh pair of eyes really does help.</p><p>Phil takes a moment to look at his notebook &ndash; which he holds close out of Dan&rsquo;s sight &ndash; then at Dan. He eyes Dan with a smirk on his lips. &ldquo;How do I know you won&rsquo;t go steal my ideas?&rdquo; </p><p>He&rsquo;s clearly joking but Dan can understand where Phil&rsquo;s coming from. It&rsquo;s not a serious question, but at the same time, it is. It&rsquo;s hard to trust people in the youtube industry these days.</p><p>&ldquo;My lips are sealed&rdquo; Dan winks, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll tell you the plans for my next video in return.&rdquo; He wants to retract the arrangement he as soon as he offers it, but it&rsquo;s too late. When he&rsquo;s with Phil, he completely loses his natural filter and any sense of self-control along with it. It&rsquo;s maddening, really.</p><p>Phil eyes him for a moment.&ldquo;Deal,&rdquo; he agrees with a nod, looking very pleased with the bargain. </p><p>Dan watches him glance down at his still hidden notebook, like he&rsquo;s still contemplating the offer, then smiles to himself before sharing all the details. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Q and A video, like I told you yesterday&hellip;&rdquo; He thinks for a moment, concentrating on his notes, then back to Dan with a little more confidence. &ldquo;But I was thinking about doing it with another person there, like another youtuber asks me the questions, or maybe a friend?&rdquo; He explains, the concentration still very clear. He takes a sip of his coffee, brows furrowed like he&rsquo;s still thinking, so Dan waits until he continues, not wanting to interrupt Phils thought process.</p><p>Phil bites his lip, hesitating before he continues. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t want it to be boring, it needs something else, but I just don&rsquo;t know <i>what</i>.&rdquo; Phil sighs, beginning to sounds a little discouraged. &ldquo;Everything I come up with is ridiculous and stupid.&rdquo; He frowns, leaning back in his chair.</p><p>Dan tilts his head to the side smiling slightly as he fully registers what Phil is saying, and it all makes his heart fill to the point that his chest &ndash; as cheesy as it is &ndash; might explode. Dan could tell from watching Phil in his videos that he&rsquo;s passionate about what he does, but seeing it in action, seeing him so worked up about what it loves&hellip; It&rsquo;s enough make even Dan feel inspired. The man is just so genuine in what he does, maybe the whole youtube world isn&rsquo;t as shallow as Dan constantly assumes it is?</p><p>Dan swallows and finally responds. &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t sound stupid to me. It sounds like you really care about your work. That in and of itself is enough to make a video interesting to watch,&rdquo; Dan assures Phil. <i>Where the hell is this positivity coming from?</i> &ldquo;The fact that you&rsquo;re putting this much energy into it means its bound to be good. Besides I think it&rsquo;s a cool idea to have another person involved in the video.&rdquo; Seriously, when did Dan become this sparking ray of sunshine? Dan care barely muster the mindset to get out of bed in the morning? What is Phil doing to him? </p><p>The weird part is, Dan<i> actually </i>means every word he&rsquo;s saying.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I just feel like like the whole Q and A thing is so overdone, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; Phil asks defeatedly, tapping his pencil on the table.</p><p>&ldquo;It sounds like you&rsquo;re overthinking it. Isn&rsquo;t that supposed to be my thing? Are you coming for my brand?&rdquo; Dan jokes, chuckling at the way Phil rolls his eyes in response. </p><p>&ldquo;Speaking of your <i>brand</i>,&rdquo; Phil teases, &ldquo;I believe you owe me a sneak peek into Daniel Howell&rsquo;s next video.&rdquo; Phil looks him directly in the eye and Dan shivers at the use of his full name. It&rsquo;s hot, and it sounds really fucking good in Phil&rsquo;s voice. He has to take a moment not to jump Phil then and there. Christ, his younger self might have.</p><p>Phil looks at him with a questioning smirk, like he can read Dan&rsquo;s very terribly concealed  reaction to his words. Dan can feel his skin flush hot, and he jumps slightly when someone comes up to their table. It&rsquo;s that damn girl who seems to think 2009 emo is still a thing. Dan clenches his jaw, forcing himself not to make a sarcastic comment. </p><p>&ldquo;Can I get you anything?&rdquo; She asks flatly, staring at Dan. In her hands, she holds what looks like a torn scrap piece of paper and pen.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know this place did table service,&rdquo; Phil asks through his teeth, sounding annoyed as he looks at her in a way that doesn&rsquo;t scream friendly.</p><p>It&rsquo;s terrible, but it does makes Dan feel slightly better. Seeing Phil unimpressed with her is better than seeing them flirt.</p><p>&ldquo;We do now,&rdquo; she snaps, turning to Dan. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; she says sounding annoyed. </p><p>Dan furrows his brows, his gaze flitting back and forth between Sarah and Phil. Is she purposefully trying to interrupt them? Is <i>she</i> jealous? The thought pleases Dan. If she&rsquo;s jealous, that means there&rsquo;s something between him and Phil to be <i>jealous of.</i> On second thought, is Dan happy about that? Because that sounds awfully terrifying and real.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want anything.&rdquo; Dan remarks sassily and considers adding &lsquo;from you&rsquo; to the sentence, but decides that might be a little too much sass. So instead he glares at her, willing her to walk away in his mind.</p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; she scoffs, eyeing Dan like she doesn&rsquo;t believe him. For a second, she hovers before she spins on her heel back to the cashier where she barks an order at one of her co-workers.</p><p>Looks like Dan&rsquo;s will power worked for once.</p><p>&ldquo;You get used to her,&rdquo; Phil reassures Dan. &ldquo;She can be nice, I swear.  Look at this!&rdquo; Phil shows Dan the half sunken in, frothy Pikachu &mdash; the latte art that Dan already saw online, because he has a problem when it comes to stalking Phils social media.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I saw that on your Instagram when I was standing outsi- when I was walking here.&rdquo; Dan hasty corrects himself, almost blowing his cover that he&rsquo;s not a complete freak who avidly checks Phils instagram, and stands outside coffee shops for an embarrassing amount of time before actually go in to see him. Thankfully, Phil doesn&rsquo;t seem to catch on.</p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it adorable?&rdquo; Phil smiles, staring at the cup. Dan absolutely melts at the man&rsquo;s fondness for something as simple as themed latte art.</p><p>&ldquo;It is, though probably a bit weird when you started sipping away Pikachu&rsquo;s face,&rdquo; Dan laughs slightly when Phil tilts his head to the side, realizing the damage he&rsquo;s done to poor Pikachu.</p><p>Phil looks at the cup then back at Dan, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think about that.&rdquo; He chuckles, then playfully grimaces when he puts the cup down.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve crippled him for life Phil.&rdquo; Dean teases through a grin. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never be the same.&rdquo; Dan adds, theatrically putting his hand on his heart and looks off into the distance.</p><p>Phil looks half traumatized, and half like he&rsquo;s trying not to laugh as he turns the deformed Pikachu away from him. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t look him in the face, not anymore,&rdquo; Phil says dramatically.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Because he doesn&rsquo;t have one,&rdquo; Dan giggles and Phil can&rsquo;t hold back his laugh either. How is joking around with Phil so damn easy? Usually it takes Dan <i>weeks</i> to warm up to a person like he has to Phil.</p><p>Phil pretends to look shocked while giggling a little. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make it worse! I feel guilty enough as it is.&rdquo; Phil jokingly pleads, unable to hide his smile as he leans his notebook on the cup blocking it from his view.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s eye catches a few words on the notebook, two of them jumping out and Dan immediately begins to sweat with anxiety.</p><p><i>Daniel Howell.</i></p><p>Is that Dan&rsquo;s name? Why the hell is his name there? Dan&rsquo;s mind desperately tries to imagine what purpose Phil could possibly have for his name being there. And worse, the sentences around Dan&rsquo;s name aren&rsquo;t helpful in any way and are basically a blur in Dan&rsquo;s panic, so they don&rsquo;t give him any clues. Is Phil planning on talking about Dan in his next video? Does he plan on telling his followers he&rsquo;s found his soulmate?</p><p>That he&rsquo;s found <i>Dan</i>?</p><p>Dan skin feels hot and his chest begins to prickle in a very unpleasant way. Is it him, or did this coffee shop used to be bigger before? The walls certainly seem a lot closer than he remembers. </p><p>Dan&rsquo;s not ready for any of this. He&rsquo;s not ready for the world to know. Feeling sick, he tries to read more of the notebook, looking for any details of what Phil has planned.</p><p>Phil quickly pulls back the notebook when he notices where Dan&rsquo;s eyes have landed. His gaze snaps up to Dan&rsquo;s, almost looking as panicked as Dan feels.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to tell anyone,&rdquo; Phil quickly blurts out. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just, I got a lot of questions about you!&rdquo; His words are quick, like he&rsquo;s trying to explain before Dan runs. &ldquo;I thought it would be weird if I didn&rsquo;t answer one. Considering about 80% of them were about you.&rdquo; he says panicked, clearly trying to explain himself. &ldquo;Our radio show really got people excited!&rdquo; Phil turns his notebook toward Dan and places it on the table in front of him. He points to one of the sentences near Dan&rsquo;s name.</p><p><b>What was it like having Dan on your radio show?!?!?! - @phillysgirl</b></p><p>It helps a little when Dan reads more, and all the questions Phil chose about him are relatively surface level. When he reaches the bottom though, Dan&rsquo;s cheeks flush. This ones a little cheeky.</p><p><b>Dan is one sexy man in his videos, does the same go for real life? - @Jessicab</b></p><p>&ldquo;I think the appropriate answer for the last question is yes.&rdquo; Dan nervously laughs, feeling his body become a little less tense. </p><p>Phil&rsquo;s eyes widen (he must have forgot about that last one) and he grabs his notebook back, closing it so the green cover faces up. &ldquo;Agreed.&rdquo; He laughs half heartedly.</p><p>Dan can tell Phil&rsquo;s trying not to scare him. And don&rsquo;t get Dan wrong, he wants nothing more than to run. To go back to his flat and pretend like the entire last month didn&rsquo;t happen. But he can&rsquo;t. He needs to know <i>for sure</i> that Phil won&rsquo;t tell anyone. He needs to be able to trust that Phil won&rsquo;t tell. But can Dan do that?</p><p>Once again, Dan is riddled with the knowledge that, as much as it feels like it, Dan doesn&rsquo;t <i>really </i>know who Phil is. He&rsquo;s a complete stranger. He could just be another youtuber out for the fame and nothing else &ndash; having Dan as his soulmate would only skyrocket his youtube channel further. People love drama, especially when romance and soulmates are involved.</p><p>Dan bites his lip so hard he tastes a hint of blood. &ldquo;I want to believe that you won&rsquo;t tell anyone, but how? I&rsquo;ve watched your videos, I know the person you show to the world. But I don&rsquo;t know<i> you</i>.&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s tries to keep his voice even and professional, and he almost does until it wavers at the end.</p><p>Phils eyes soften at Dan&rsquo;s honesty; he seems a shocked at how open Dan is being. Phil leans forward, as if to show Dan that he has his full attention.  &ldquo;Well I can&rsquo;t say the person I show online is completely who I am, but give me a chance to show you that you can trust me.&rdquo; Phil is gentle, he&rsquo;s trying desperately not to scare Dan. &ldquo;I promise this isn&rsquo;t all a joke to me.&rdquo; he continues seriously, looking Dan directly in the eyes. &ldquo;Besides, I haven&rsquo;t told anyone yet have I? And it&rsquo;s been over a month since we&hellip;&rdquo; Phil trails off, reflecting on the memory of their meeting. &ldquo;Though, it probably would have made an interesting tweet.&rdquo; Phil laughs awkwardly. &ldquo;Just met my soulmate, he ran away from me.&rdquo; Phil mocks Dan playfully.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t&ndash; I didn&rsquo;t <i>run</i>, I haven&rsquo;t <i>run</i> in years,&rdquo; Dan defends himself, trying not to crack a small smile.</p><p>&ldquo;You ran,&rdquo; Phil says matter of factly.</p><p>Yes, he definitely ran. Like a frightened child.</p><p>They sit in silence for a moment, just long enough for Dan to try and digest what is happening. How can they go from something serious to joking around so easily?</p><p>&ldquo;You like Mario Kart?&rdquo; Phil pipes up, raising a brow.</p><p>&ldquo;Only a crazy person would say no,&rdquo; Dan scoffs dramatically.</p><p>&ldquo;Want to come to mine and play a few rounds?&rdquo; Phil asks, sounding like he&rsquo;s trying not to be <i>too</i> hopeful.</p><p>Dan sighs and looks at Phil, studying the man intensely. He wants to go, but it feels like saying yes will open the floodgates to something Dan isn&rsquo;t ready for. If he says yes to this, Phil might be encouraged to invite Dan over more often. Or invite Dan <i>out</i>, even.</p><p>Is that a bad thing?</p><p>&ldquo;How else are you supposed to learn to trust me, if you don&rsquo;t take the chance to get to know me?&rdquo; Phil needles, still managing to not come off <i>too</i> forward. But maybe forward is exactly the push Dan needs.</p><p>&ldquo;I not sure&hellip;&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s about to say no, but the disappointed frown Phil is already showing is too much for Dan to bare. Dan swallows thickly, and closes his eyes for a fraction of a second before looking back at Phil. &ldquo;Alright, a couple rounds won&rsquo;t hurt,&rdquo; Dan reluctantly agrees, and when Phil&rsquo;s eyes flare with excitement, Dan knows it&rsquo;s worth the anxiety.</p><p>&ldquo;Great! My flat&rsquo;s about a fifteen-ish minute walk.&rdquo; Phil quickly begins to pack up his things, as if not wanting to give Dan the chance to back out.</p><p>Dan didn&rsquo;t bring much with his aside from his phone, so he stands up and waits for Phil to put everything in his backpack. Dan watches tentatively, savouring the small moment. It&rsquo;s strange seeing someone usually seen on the other side of a computer screen in real life. Dan&rsquo;s so used to seeing Phil from a certain angle &ndash; he watches Phil bring his plate and half full cup to the counter, and it feels <i>strange</i>. It&rsquo;s a good strange, though. Dan gets to see an unscripted part of him that few others get to see.</p><p>Who knew Dan could be so mesmerized by the back of someone&rsquo;s head?</p><p>Dan watches him make a comment to Sarah which actually makes her laugh, something Dan has yet to see her do since he walked into the shop &mdash; and any other encounter he&rsquo;s had with her, really.</p><p>Phil turns toward Dan and starts in his direction, &ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; he asks, holding the door open for Dan.</p><p>As they first begin their walk, it&rsquo;s silent, but not the type of silence where Dan desperately tries to find a subject or make a sarcastic comment to fill the silence. But a silence that feels comfortable, natural even. They walk side by side, but now that Dan&rsquo;s made himself aware of the silence, he can&rsquo;t help but say something to break it.</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip;&rdquo; Dan trials off realizing he didn&rsquo;t actually come up with anything to say. &ldquo;Why amazingphil?&rdquo; Dan asks, quickly trying to recover. He looks curiously a Phil, pretty sure he knows the answer but still wonders &ndash; was he simply trying to be funny, or is he actually <i>that</i> clever?</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I could tell you,&rdquo; Phil smirks cheekily. &ldquo;But then all my mystery and charm would be gone,&rdquo; he teases, sneaking a glance at Dan from the corner of his eye. He looks absolutely marvelous, and Dan nearly forgets how to breathe. The red stoplight from across the street elicits a red hue against Phil&rsquo;s skin, and bounces off the darkness of his hair, creating a red glow behind him.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo; Dan breaths, slightly caught up in how stunning Phil is. Dan clears his throat, pretending he wasn&rsquo;t staring.</p><p>&ldquo;Why the change from danisnotonfire, to Daniel Howell?&rdquo; Phil asks. Though if he&rsquo;s seen Dan&rsquo;s videos, he knows exactly why - Dan had explained it when he made the change. Maybe Phil was lying about seeing his video. Phil continues on before Dan has the chance to be disappointed, though. &ldquo;I mean I know<i> why</i>, but I want to know why exactly?&rdquo; Phil answers Dan&rsquo;s question. &ldquo;Like, what lead to the change?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan ponders the question for a moment. &ldquo;It was time,&rdquo; Dan says finally. &ldquo;Danisnotonfire represents a different me. It was someone who was afraid to be themselves, but Daniel Howell on the other hand, he&rsquo;s working on living his truth.&rdquo; Dan says with more confidence than he expects. Sure he&rsquo;s said these things to a camera before, but never to a human person (that&rsquo;s not his therapist), that always seemed way to terrifying. He&rsquo;s not sure why he&rsquo;s being so honest with Phil. He can barely talk to Anne about this stuff, but here he is, telling someone who is practically a stranger.</p><p>&ldquo;Does Daniel Howell always talk about himself in the third person?&rdquo; Phil chuckles, smiling fondly.</p><p>&ldquo;Only when he&rsquo;s trying to dissociate himself from the serious and heavy shit in life,&rdquo; Dan jokes, looking at his feet as his cheeks colour with a blush.</p><p>&ldquo;That seems healthy.&rdquo; Phil bumps Dan with his shoulder. &ldquo;This is me.&rdquo; He points to a building that is significantly nicer than Dan&rsquo;s. Brick lines the exterior, leading up to at least five floors. Phil opens the glass door, leading to the entranceway. Dan takes note of the white marble walls as they make their way to the elevator, they&rsquo;d be perfect for his Instagram aesthetic. Which Dan knows is a terrible thing to come to mind immediately, but hey social media is literally his career. He can&rsquo;t help it.   </p><p>&ldquo;Fancy,&rdquo; Dan remarks sarcastically, feeling a little intimidated. Dan knows Phil isn&rsquo;t hurting financially, between the popularity of his youtube channel and the radio show. Still, Dan can&rsquo;t help feeling a tad inadequate. Does this sort of stuff matter to Phil?</p><p>&ldquo;Trust me, it&rsquo;s not that fancy, wait until you actually see my flat. It&rsquo;s definitely due for some repairs.&rdquo; Phil assures Dan, pressing the button to floor five.</p><p>They step out into a narrow hall and stop at the first door on the left. Dan watches Phil open the door but doesn&rsquo;t follow him inside. Instead, he stands outside, hesitantly rocking from foot to foot. Facing the entrance of Phil&rsquo;s flat feels symbolic for some reason. Coming to Phil&rsquo;s place, laughing with him, talking to him, and not wanting the day to end. It&rsquo;s surreal.</p><p>Dan had literally spent a good chunk if his late teens &ndash; hell, his adulthood &ndash; dreaming of this exact scenario. And now, it&rsquo;s really happening.</p><p>How the<i> fuck</i> did Dan get here?</p><p>He&rsquo;s torn between excitement and resentment. Dan knows their banter and teasing is all fabricated, but a small part of him wishes it wasn&rsquo;t. Dan may have daydreamed about being Phil&rsquo;s soulmate, but he never actually <i>wanted</i> it to happen. If Dan had gotten to know Phil without the soulmate bullshit, he hoped it would have been because Phil is actually interested in Dan and his work, not out of obligation.</p><p>Dan is standing outside the home of the man of his dreams for all the wrong reasons. He&rsquo;s only here because the universe is telling Phil this is how it&rsquo;s supposed to be. But Dan hasn&rsquo;t been brainwashed to believe it like Phil.</p><p>Dan knows the truth - that soulmates are bullshit. And it leaves a small aching hole in his heart.</p><p>How is Dan supposed to know Phil <i>actually</i> wants him here? Did Phil only suggest he come over because they&rsquo;re soulmates? Does Phil really like having Dan around, or does he like the idea of him? The idea of being a part of an elite group of those who&rsquo;ve found the person they&rsquo;re supposed to spend the rest of their life with.</p><p>&ldquo;You coming inside?&rdquo; Phil awkwardly chuckles, looking at Dan curiously.</p><p>&ldquo;Yea, sorry,&rdquo; Dan mumbles, hesitant as he steps through the doorway. He&rsquo;s holding his breath as if waiting for something bad to happen, and when it doesn&rsquo;t, he exhales.</p><p>Maybe staying for an hour or so wouldn&rsquo;t hurt?</p><p>Dan shuts the door behind him and when he does, he hears a thump come from somewhere in the flat.</p><p>&ldquo;Always so graceful she is,&rdquo; Phil sighs and turns toward the end of the hall. &ldquo;Do you want a drink?&rdquo; Phil offers with a shy smile, gesturing for Dan to follow him. &ldquo;Or tea?&rdquo; He asks over his shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;A drink is perfect,&rdquo; Dan says a little too eagerly, and follows Phil down the narrow hallway deeper into Phil&rsquo;s flat. The small hallway is relatively bare, aside from a plant, which has probably seen better days, placed near the door of Phil&rsquo;s kitchen. A sense of satisfaction comes to Dan knowing that the silly part of Phil he portrays about his inability to keep houseplants alive is true. Dan chuckles to himself. He knows it&rsquo;s common knowledge to Phil&rsquo;s followers, but seeing it in person makes Dan feel special somehow.</p><p>Phil follows Dan&rsquo;s eye to the poor plant. &ldquo;I kept it alive for quite a while!&rdquo; he defends himself while holding back a smile, clearly pretending to be serious. They walk into the kitchen, which is definitely bigger than Dan&rsquo;s, not to mention a lot more colourful, and Dan sees a row of small cacti along the backside of the counter. Of the five that live - or, well, <i>sit</i> - there, only one still resembles something close to the colour green.</p><p>&ldquo;Jesus Phil,&rdquo; Dan laughs, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even have to water a cactus that much, and you&rsquo;ve still managed to kill more than half of them,&rdquo; he teases, pointing to the unfortunate casualties. &ldquo;You really weren&rsquo;t joking?&rdquo; Dan turns to Phil notices his slightly blushed cheeks.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my fault! They just die! It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m cursed!&rdquo; Phil exclaims in defence as he grabs two wine glasses from one of his cupboards.</p><p>From around the corner, little patters of feet come bolting through the flat. Dan looks to Phil, who doesn&rsquo;t seem at all alarmed by the noise, and then back toward the opening to the far side of the kitchen. A small but absolutely adorable corgi comes zooming around the corner, with such speed it almost runs right into the wall.</p><p>Phil has a dog?</p><p>&ldquo;You have a dog?&rdquo; Dan asks dumbfounded. Phil has <i>never</i> mentioned anything about a dog on his channel. Why has he never mentioned it? Dan&rsquo;s stomach knots, there&rsquo;s so much he doesn&rsquo;t know about Phil.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes! Dan meet Nala, Nala meet Dan.&rdquo; Phil smiles down at the dog, as if hiding the fact that he has a dog - something that would probably get him loads of views, honestly - from his fans is a completely normal thing to do.</p><p>&ldquo;And why does no one know about this precious doggo?&rdquo; Dan asks genuinely shocked. But of course, Dan&rsquo;s confusion doesn&rsquo;t stop him from leaning down and petting the precious thing, she wags her tail, looking up at Dan and seeming satisfied by Dan&rsquo;s pets.</p><p>&ldquo;I really haven&rsquo;t had her that long, only about six months. I plan on introducing her to my viewers, just haven&rsquo;t gotten around to it yet,&rdquo; Phil explains, shrugging slightly. &ldquo;Every time I think about it, I just get too distracted by how adorable she is and we end up playing or napping.&rdquo; Phil continues pouring white wine into their glasses. After, he hands Dan a bag of treats from one of the drawers.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, that is absolutely valid.&rdquo; Dan smiles down at the dog, sitting on the floor as he uses his baby voice to address her. &ldquo;You are so cute Nala, yes you are.&rdquo; He feeds her a treat, and then two, and then two more. &ldquo;Okay, I better stop before you eat them all.&rdquo; Dan stands up, his heartbreaking at the disappointed look Nala gives him as she starts to wine.</p><p>Unable to help the smile on his face Dan looks to Phil, who is staring at Dan in a way that makes Dan&rsquo;s chest flutter. Phil looks absolutely mesmerized as he fondly smiles at the two of them. Dan clears his throat, making Phil go a very dark shade of red. </p><p>Phil rolls his eyes, pretending what just happened, didn&rsquo;t happen. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s so dramatic, I swear,&rdquo; Phil says, sounding a bit fond still.  He then looks at the dog matter of factly, &ldquo;Nala, you already had dinner today stop complaining.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s stern yet playful. &ldquo;Everything is set up in the lounge.&rdquo; Phil hands Dan his wine and gestures for him to follow him through the doorway where Nala had come bolting from.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a TV set up at the opposite end of the room, placed above a fireplace. </p><p>What Dan wouldn&rsquo;t give to have a fireplace.</p><p>They make their way to the couch, and Dan sits down on the completely opposite side of the sofa to Phil. Nala quickly follows suit, jumping up between them on the couch, thankfully making the space between them a little less obvious. Feeling nervous about being in Phils space, Dan takes a couple generous gulps of wine, then places his glass on the coffee table beside Phil&rsquo;s. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright, get ready for defeat.&rdquo; Phil taunts, powering up the game.</p><p>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s confident. Enjoy it while you can, it won&rsquo;t last long.&rdquo; Dan bants back, taking the controller Phil hands him. Dan quickly checks his phone when he feels it vibrate in his pocket. Anne is texting him, but she can wait. He puts the phone on the table, focusing back to the game. They speed through selecting their players and carts, clearly each having a standard go-to, and dive right into the game.   </p><p>Dan wins. And wins and wins and wins. And then Phil <i>almost</i> wins, but Dan wins again. Every time they end a round, Phil somehow convinces Dan to start another, claiming he&rsquo;s just warming up. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh sure, you just don&rsquo;t know when to quit,&rdquo; Dan teases starting the race again, which of course <i>he wins</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;HA!&rdquo; Dan shouts, probably far too loud for how late it is &ndash; hopefully Phil&rsquo;s walls aren&rsquo;t too thin. Nala makes her annoyance clear as she jumps off the couch and moves to the dog bed beside the television.</p><p>&ldquo;See, told you,&rdquo; Dan continues, his volume a little more under control. &ldquo;I am the Mario Kart champion, no one can beat me.&rdquo; He smirks, putting his controller down on the coffee table and turning on the couch to face Phil. He&rsquo;s looking at Dan with the fondest smile, strange for someone who just lost nine times in a row.</p><p>&ldquo;Look it&rsquo;s not over yet. I could still have a few tricks up my sleeves.&rdquo; Phil confidently crosses his arms over his chest eyeing Dan.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure, keep telling yourself that.&rdquo; Dan teases sarcastically, all while holding back a giggle, and instead rolling his eyes playfully.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just have to rematch another day, after I&rsquo;ve had time to perfect my skills.&rdquo; Phil tries to defend himself.</p><p>Remembering his wine, Dan leans forward to grab it, the cuff his sleeve riding up in the process of reaching for the glass. Dan freezes midway to the table, and he hears Phil&rsquo;s breath hitch. Dan looks overs and sees that Phil&rsquo;s eyes are boring into him. Following Phil&rsquo;s intense stare, Dan shifts his gaze to his wrist - his <i>nearly</i> <i>exposed</i> - wrist, and is starkly reminded of the name written there.</p><p>Dan puts the glass back on the table and nervously pulls his sleeves down. It takes him a moment to meet Phil&rsquo;s gaze. Dan had almost forgotten, he&rsquo;d almost let himself pretend the situation, their <i>friendship</i>, or whatever it is, isn&rsquo;t completely <i>fucked.</i></p><p>Phil swallows, and Dan watches his adam&rsquo;s apple bob. He clears his throat. &ldquo;Can I&hellip;&rdquo; Phil trails off quietly, his hand on the couch inching towards Dan. </p><p>Dan can practically see the internal battle Phil is having with himself. </p><p>&ldquo;Can I see it?&rdquo; Phil gently asks, putting his own controller down to turn and face Dan more directly.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s mouth goes dry.</p><p>The way Phil&rsquo;s looking at him pumps Dan full with anxiety. The desperation is clear, Phil wants things from Dan than Dan isn&rsquo;t sure he can give. But still, this is something Dan can give him. It couldn&rsquo;t hurt, right?</p><p>Dan pulls up his sleeve slightly, exposing his pale flesh where Phil&rsquo;s name is permanently tattooed into his skin.</p><p>Phil sucks in when he sees it. He reaches out but pulls his hand back immediately. Dan watches Phil intently. He watches the way Phil flexes his jaw, and holds his fist tight, forcing himself to keep his hands steady.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; Dan says quietly, moving his wrist closer to Phil, silently telling him he can touch.</p><p>Phil looks at him surprised. &ldquo;You sure?&rdquo; He asks softly, genuinely seeming to want Dan&rsquo;s permission.</p><p>&ldquo;Ye- Yeah.&rdquo; Dan stutters, holding his breath.</p><p>Phil reaches out, but doesn&rsquo;t touch the raised skin with black letters first. Instead, he gently wraps his hand around Dan&rsquo;s wrist and lightly pulls it closer to his own body. Dan shivers, savouring the feeling of Phil&rsquo;s skin on his.</p><p>Dan shuffles closer so he doesn&rsquo;t have to awkwardly lean across the space between them. His knee rests in front of him on the couch and tingles where it touches Phil&rsquo;s thigh, even through the fabric of their jeans.</p><p>Dan feels restless as he watches Phil inspect the tattoo. Turning his head to the side curiously, Phil thumbs his finger over the name on Dan&rsquo;s skin. A rush of desire floods Dan&rsquo;s body and he finds himself leaning forward, his breath coming out heavy, matching Phil&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; Phil breathes, furrowing his brow in concentration as he inspects the letters.</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo; Dan clears his throat, lost in the moment. The sound of his own voice snaps him out of it and he quickly retracts his hand from Phil&rsquo;s. Immediately, he misses the warmth of Phil&rsquo;s palm. &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Dan apologizes for no particular reason and quickly stands up. &ldquo;I should go.&rdquo; Dan quickly mumbles, looking at the clock hanging on the wall. </p><p>How the hell is it already one in the morning.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, uh&hellip;&rdquo; Phil begins, clearing his throat, he&rsquo;s about to say more but Dan is already out of sight, heading straight for the door. Dan winces when he slams it shut behind him, not expecting the loud bang when it hits the frame. But, it doesn&rsquo;t stop Dan from taking the stairs down two at a time to the lobby, too impatient to wait for the elevator. Too afraid that Phil would chase after him, Dan&rsquo;s pace quickens at the thought.</p><p>Dan doesn&rsquo;t stop walking until he makes it back to his flat, a walk that should have taken twenty minutes, he does in only seven. Probably the most vigorous physical activity Dan has done in months.</p><p>When he finally unlocks his door after three tries, Dan goes straight for the couch and flops onto the cushions, face first in his favourite fluffy pillow. </p><p>Things got way too personal.</p><p>He&rsquo;s such an idiot. How did he let the night get that far? Everything had been fine, fun even, until Phil had to go and make things serious.</p><p>Dan reaches for his pocket needing a distraction, but when he pats down his clothing he notices something vital missing.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding me,&rdquo; Dan curses himself. He scrunches his eyes closed and looks up at the ceiling in defeat and lets out a long sigh.</p><p>He left his phone at Phil&rsquo;s place.</p>",

He just can&rsquo;t believe in system the dictates the direction of his life before he even has a say in the matter. The timer on Dan&rsquo;s arm counts down to the second that Dan will meet his soulmate, and despite his utter reluctance and dread for the moment to come, he almost finds himself happy it does. He might not have imagined it would happen the way it does, but he just can&rsquo;t help but feel something for the mysterious man named Philip Lester.
