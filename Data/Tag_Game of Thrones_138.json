        "body": "<img src=\"http://ifttt.com/images/no_image_card.png\"/><br/><div class=\"md\"><p>Based solely on my imagination and having way too much time on my hands - roll on April :)</p> <p>Episode 1: Winterfell reunions while the Northernmost castles fall. Castle Black is destroyed, and the remaining Night&rsquo;s Watch are slaughtered and become Wights. Tormund and Dundarion managed to survive Eastwatch and begin to make their way South. When Jon, Dany and co arrive at Winterfell, Jon plays diplomat between the Stark sisters and Dany, including telling them he has given her his allegiance&hellip; Sansa does not like this. Arya has a reunion with Gendry. Bran / Sam ask to speak with Jon in private - but before they can tell him of his lineage, a raven arrives with news that the wall has been breached and the Night King is heading their way. Soon Jaime arrives. Bran sees Jaime and remembers what happened in the pilot. Jaime\u2019s help is welcomed by Jon and Tyrion but not welcomed by the other Starks. Bran advises them to let Jaime live. In the end they reluctantly do so. Night King\u2019s army closes in on Winterfell to end the episode.</p> <p>Episode 2: Battle for Winterfell. Dany is horrified to see what has become of one of her dragons. Ghost saves Jon but is killed in the process. Jaime saves Bran\u2019s life towards the end of the battle. Winterfell is completely overrun and the protagonists are forced to flee. Dany and her dragons buy them time enabling them to flee but Dany is wounded. They get away, but they are scattered / separated a little. Anyone killed gets turned into a Wight, including ghost.</p> <p>Episode 3 Winterfell survivors regroup - Jaime promises to lead them south to the safety of Kings landing and Red Keep. Jon agrees. Tarly tells Jon his lineage. He is shocked. Ravens work overtime to warn the land of impending doom and for everyone to retreat to Kings Landing. The Unsullied receive one of these ravens and leave Casterly Rock to march for Kings Landing. Euron&rsquo;s plans to get the Golden Company backfire when Daario Naharis thwarts him in Essos. Euron is forced to flee without them. Bran tells Jaime he knows Cersei is planning to double cross the North. Jaime promises everyone that he and Tyrion will be able to convince Cersei to let them into the city when they arrive at King&rsquo;s Landing. Dany&rsquo;s condition worsens. She becomes ill, and it is learned she is pregnant. They arrive at King&rsquo;s landing, and Cersei locks the gates, leaving them out in the cold of Winter while she outlasts the Winter from within the city with Olenna&rsquo;s grain. She and Qyburn planted Wildfire all around the city walls and vows to blow up anyone that tries to get in, including Jaime and Tyrion. She will only let them in on one condition, that they kill Dany and swear loyalty to her. Bronn delivers this message on behalf of Cersei, but then he too is locked out when Jon refuses to sacrifice Dany.</p> <p>Episode 4: Battle at sea between Euron and Theon, Yara is saved but she dies anyway, proclaiming Theon to be redeemed before dying. Theon receives word of Westeros&rsquo; plight and sails for Blackwater Bay with supplies. The Unsullied arrive at King&rsquo;s Landing. They camp with the others outside the walls for months, everyone outside the wall begins to starve. As the months pass, news arrives of the destruction of other northern castles and cities such as Oldtown, The Eyrie, etc, and the progress south of the Night King&rsquo;s army. Dany&rsquo;s pregnancy progresses, but her condition weakens. Pressure grows on Jon and co to sacrifice her, but he stands firm. Theon arrives with supplies which are most welcome. Melisandre is with him, much to the anger of Davos. A plan is hatched by Varys &amp; Tyrion to fly a dragon over the walls, and open the gates from the inside. They convince Jon that only he will have a chance to control Dany&rsquo;s dragons now, given Dany is unwell and Jon has Targaryan blood. &ldquo;Night Ghost&rdquo; attacks Jon&rsquo;s tent - Jon kills him, and now knows the rest of the Night King&rsquo;s army will soon be upon them. Cersei looks out her window to see Jon flying over the city walls on a Dragon.</p> <p>Episode 5: Battle of the Living in Kings Landing. Some big deaths. Jon does enough to get the gates open but his dragon is shot down and both Jon and the dragon die. The remaining protagonists storm the city and defeat Cersei&rsquo;s forces. Cersei should be heavily pregnant by now but it becomes clear she was faking it. She is taken prisoner, placed in the same cell alongside Ellaria Sand and the rotted corpse of her daughter.
