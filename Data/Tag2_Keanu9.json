Santino D'Antonio. John knew what he was here for before Santino could even say hello, or rather,</p><p>&ldquo;Ciao, John.&rdquo; Santino spoke, a small smirk teasing at the corner of his lips. He felt rather confident, despite staring at the Baba Yaga himself. He knew he had the upper hand at the moment, and relished in that as he shook John&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Santino.&rdquo; John replied cooly, glancing behind Santino at the cars and guards. He made eye contact with what appeared to be his right hand woman, her eyes locked firmly on him. </p><p>&ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo; He asked, tucking his hands into his pockets and rocking on his feet slightly.</p><p>John stepped back slightly, &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; He replied in Italian, John quickly looked back to where you were still sitting, body practically frozen. He knew that Santino was a dangerous man, and it would be preferable that he didn&rsquo;t know you existed. But he had his home surrounded, so it wasn&rsquo;t like you could leave. &ldquo;Caf\u00e9?&rdquo; John continued, walking down the hall.\u00a0 He sent Santino into the living room, and gestured for you to follow him as we went to the coffee machine. </p><p>John was staring straight ahead as he slowly poured a single cup of espresso, he turned to you. He sighed softly, then turned and began walking towards the living room, making sure you were right behind him. He set the cup in front of Santino, and sat down. </p><p>As you walked in you saw Santino scratching your pitbull, and you felt anger like a pit in your stomach growing. You didn&rsquo;t like this guy&rsquo;s attitude, his smug smile, his Italian suit, and you definitely didn&rsquo;t like his hands on your dog. He looked up at you as you entered, a flash of surprise crossed his face as his eyes looked you over. &ldquo;I was sorry to hear about your wife John, but I didn&rsquo;t realize you had a puppy&hellip; and a child.&rdquo; Santino spoke, you felt uncomfortable under his gaze, but maintained eye contact. </p><p>You and Santino turned as John spoke, his voice was quiet yet firm, &ldquo;(Y/N), can you take the dog out, please?&rdquo; He asked you, you looked at him with a bit of surprise before cooing to the pup and leading him out of the living room. </p><p>~</p><p>As you exited, Santino leaned back in his chair, his body relaxed, yet his face still carried that devilish smile. &ldquo;Listen John, in all sincerity,&rdquo; he leaned forward, staring right at John. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be here.&rdquo; </p><p>John shifted slightly, never breaking eye contact. &ldquo;Please. Don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He spoke, his tone still firm and unwavering. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m asking you not to do this.&rdquo; </p><p>Santino gently shook his head, chuckling softly as he reached into his pocket, &ldquo;Nobody gets out of the business and gets to waltz back in without repercussions, John.&rdquo; He pulled out the marker, the rich gold of the marker contrasting with the dark coffee table as he slid it across the table towards John. &ldquo;If not for what I did, you wouldn&rsquo;t have any of this.&rdquo; He swirled his finger around the room, &ldquo;That beautiful girl of yours, this house, all of it, is in part, mine.&rdquo; He tilted his head slightly, but John was not moved.</p><p>&ldquo;Take it back.&rdquo; His gaze was stone cold, hands clasped together.</p><p>The smirk had finally faltered from the Italian&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;No.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Take it back.&rdquo; John repeated, his face was impassive, but his thoughts were swirling. He couldn&rsquo;t go back in now, not now that you were in the picture. He had gotten you out too, and he knew this world would tear you to pieces if you were forced to go back. &ldquo;Find someone else.&rdquo;</p><p>Santino threw his hands up in disbelief, before grabbing the marker and flipping it open, revealing John&rsquo;s fingerprint. &ldquo;This is your blood John, you know what this means.&rdquo; He continued.

Before you could ask about what has transpired when you were gone, the two of you heard the sound of glass shattering in the room over. You turned to eachother, eyes wide.

No matter how hard he clutched onto the things he loved, they always managed to fall through his fingers.

Santino D'Antonio. John knew what he was here for before Santino could even say hello, or rather,</p><p>\u201cCiao, John.\u201d Santino spoke, a small smirk teasing at the corner of his lips. He felt rather confident, despite staring at the Baba Yaga himself. He knew he had the upper hand at the moment, and relished in that as he shook John\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cSantino.\u201d John replied cooly, glancing behind Santino at the cars and guards. He made eye contact with what appeared to be his right hand woman, her eyes locked firmly on him. </p><p>\u201cMay I come in?\u201d He asked, tucking his hands into his pockets and rocking on his feet slightly.</p><p>John stepped back slightly, \u201cOf course.\u201d He replied in Italian, John quickly looked back to where you were still sitting, body practically frozen. He knew that Santino was a dangerous man, and it would be preferable that he didn\u2019t know you existed. But he had his home surrounded, so it wasn\u2019t like you could leave. \u201cCaf\u00e9?\u201d John continued, walking down the hall.\u00a0 He sent Santino into the living room, and gestured for you to follow him as we went to the coffee machine. </p><p>John was staring straight ahead as he slowly poured a single cup of espresso, he turned to you. He sighed softly, then turned and began walking towards the living room, making sure you were right behind him. He set the cup in front of Santino, and sat down. </p><p>As you walked in you saw Santino scratching your pitbull, and you felt anger like a pit in your stomach growing. You didn\u2019t like this guy\u2019s attitude, his smug smile, his Italian suit, and you definitely didn\u2019t like his hands on your dog. He looked up at you as you entered, a flash of surprise crossed his face as his eyes looked you over. \u201cI was sorry to hear about your wife John, but I didn\u2019t realize you had a puppy\u2026 and a child.\u201d Santino spoke, you felt uncomfortable under his gaze, but maintained eye contact. </p><p>You and Santino turned as John spoke, his voice was quiet yet firm, \u201c(Y/N), can you take the dog out, please?\u201d He asked you, you looked at him with a bit of surprise before cooing to the pup and leading him out of the living room. </p><p>~</p><p>As you exited, Santino leaned back in his chair, his body relaxed, yet his face still carried that devilish smile. \u201cListen John, in all sincerity,\u201d he leaned forward, staring right at John. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be here.\u201d </p><p>John shifted slightly, never breaking eye contact. \u201cPlease. Don\u2019t.\u201d He spoke, his tone still firm and unwavering. \u201cI\u2019m asking you not to do this.\u201d </p><p>Santino gently shook his head, chuckling softly as he reached into his pocket, \u201cNobody gets out of the business and gets to waltz back in without repercussions, John.\u201d He pulled out the marker, the rich gold of the marker contrasting with the dark coffee table as he slid it across the table towards John. \u201cIf not for what I did, you wouldn\u2019t have any of this.\u201d He swirled his finger around the room, \u201cThat beautiful girl of yours, this house, all of it, is in part, mine.\u201d He tilted his head slightly, but John was not moved.</p><p>\u201cTake it back.\u201d His gaze was stone cold, hands clasped together.</p><p>The smirk had finally faltered from the Italian\u2019s face. \u201cNo.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTake it back.\u201d John repeated, his face was impassive, but his thoughts were swirling. He couldn\u2019t go back in now, not now that you were in the picture. He had gotten you out too, and he knew this world would tear you to pieces if you were forced to go back. \u201cFind someone else.\u201d</p><p>Santino threw his hands up in disbelief, before grabbing the marker and flipping it open, revealing John\u2019s fingerprint. \u201cThis is your blood John, you know what this means.\u201d He continued. He couldn\u2019t believe John was doing this, Santino\u2019s blood boiled at the fact John was refusing him, despite the marker. Despite the rules.

Santino D'Antonio. John knew what he was here for before Santino could even say hello, or rather,</p><p>&ldquo;Ciao, John.&rdquo; Santino spoke, a small smirk teasing at the corner of his lips. He felt rather confident, despite staring at the Baba Yaga himself. He knew he had the upper hand at the moment, and relished in that as he shook John&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Santino.&rdquo; John replied cooly, glancing behind Santino at the cars and guards. He made eye contact with what appeared to be his right hand woman, her eyes locked firmly on him. </p><p>&ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo; He asked, tucking his hands into his pockets and rocking on his feet slightly.</p><p>John stepped back slightly, &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; He replied in Italian, John quickly looked back to where you were still sitting, body practically frozen. He knew that Santino was a dangerous man, and it would be preferable that he didn&rsquo;t know you existed. But he had his home surrounded, so it wasn&rsquo;t like you could leave. &ldquo;Caf&eacute;?&rdquo; John continued, walking down the hall.&nbsp; He sent Santino into the living room, and gestured for you to follow him as we went to the coffee machine. </p><p>John was staring straight ahead as he slowly poured a single cup of espresso, he turned to you. He sighed softly, then turned and began walking towards the living room, making sure you were right behind him. He set the cup in front of Santino, and sat down. </p><p>As you walked in you saw Santino scratching your pitbull, and you felt anger like a pit in your stomach growing. You didn&rsquo;t like this guy&rsquo;s attitude, his smug smile, his Italian suit, and you definitely didn&rsquo;t like his hands on your dog. He looked up at you as you entered, a flash of surprise crossed his face as his eyes looked you over. &ldquo;I was sorry to hear about your wife John, but I didn&rsquo;t realize you had a puppy&hellip; and a child.&rdquo; Santino spoke, you felt uncomfortable under his gaze, but maintained eye contact. </p><p>You and Santino turned as John spoke, his voice was quiet yet firm, &ldquo;(Y/N), can you take the dog out, please?&rdquo; He asked you, you looked at him with a bit of surprise before cooing to the pup and leading him out of the living room. </p><p>~</p><p>As you exited, Santino leaned back in his chair, his body relaxed, yet his face still carried that devilish smile. &ldquo;Listen John, in all sincerity,&rdquo; he leaned forward, staring right at John. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be here.&rdquo; </p><p>John shifted slightly, never breaking eye contact. &ldquo;Please. Don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He spoke, his tone still firm and unwavering. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m asking you not to do this.&rdquo; </p><p>Santino gently shook his head, chuckling softly as he reached into his pocket, &ldquo;Nobody gets out of the business and gets to waltz back in without repercussions, John.&rdquo; He pulled out the marker, the rich gold of the marker contrasting with the dark coffee table as he slid it across the table towards John. &ldquo;If not for what I did, you wouldn&rsquo;t have any of this.&rdquo; He swirled his finger around the room, &ldquo;That beautiful girl of yours, this house, all of it, is in part, mine.&rdquo; He tilted his head slightly, but John was not moved.</p><p>&ldquo;Take it back.&rdquo; His gaze was stone cold, hands clasped together.</p><p>The smirk had finally faltered from the Italian&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;No.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Take it back.&rdquo; John repeated, his face was impassive, but his thoughts were swirling. He couldn&rsquo;t go back in now, not now that you were in the picture. He had gotten you out too, and he knew this world would tear you to pieces if you were forced to go back. &ldquo;Find someone else.&rdquo;</p><p>Santino threw his hands up in disbelief, before grabbing the marker and flipping it open, revealing John&rsquo;s fingerprint. &ldquo;This is your blood John, you know what this means.&rdquo; He continued. He couldn&rsquo;t believe John was doing this, Santino&rsquo;s blood boiled at the fact John was refusing him, despite the marker. Despite the rules. He practically flung the marker back to John&rsquo;s side of the table.</p><p>John looked down at the marker, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not that guy anymore.&rdquo; He said, pushing down memories of his task, and thinking about Helen, and Daisy, and you. He slowly slid the marker back over to Santino before standing up, and staring down at him. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s time for you to leave.&rdquo; </p><p>~</p><p>Your fingers were wrapped so tightly around the leash your knuckles were turning white, you had no clue what was going on between John and Santino. You didn&rsquo;t know how big of a threat he was, or why he was here, all you knew your gut was screaming at you that something was wrong. The pup could sense your unease, and was whining at your feet, nudging you gently with his wet nose. You reached down to gently stroke his head, he clearly wasn&rsquo;t in a walking mood, so you began to go back towards the house. The closer you were to John the safer you felt. You wanted to make sure you were there in case anything happened. </p><p>You hastily opened the back door, Santino was gone, and John was standing in the room, gently holding a photo of Helen and himself and stroking the frame. You quickly unhooked the leash from the dog&rsquo;s collar, letting him roam free as you slowly came up behind John. Before you could ask about what has transpired when you were gone, the two of you heard the sound of glass shattering in the room over. You turned to eachother, eyes wide. It felt like slow motion as the place you had come to think of as home was being overwhelmed by flame and heat. You were flung backwards by the force of it, the wind had been knocked out of you as you laid in the soft grass, gasping for breath as you stared at the burning visage of your home. </p><p>Bang. Bang. Bang. Explosion after explosion continued to assault the foundation of everything you had cared about. Your home. You slowly got up onto your knees, your body shaking with a mixture of anger and fear. The angry red hot flame continued to engulf everything around it, and you felt hot tears well up in your eyes. </p><p>You tore your eyes away from the embers, you began to quietly sob as you shuffled on your hands and knees where you saw the outline of John&rsquo;s figure. He was on his knees, his eyes locked into his home, and hands balled tightly into fists. You went to him, and collapsed onto his body, unable to control your tears as they flowed freely down your cheeks. You were in a state of shock, all you could think about was crawling towards the only thing you had left. Your fingers gripped his shirt, desperately clinging to it. </p><p>John didn&rsquo;t look down at you, but slowly wrapped his arms around your shaking shoulders. He felt a slobbery wet tongue lick at him, but his gaze remained fixed on his smoldering home. Again, flashes of memories whirled around in his mind, their edges crisping up and falling away. No matter how hard he clutched onto the things he loved, they always managed to fall through his fingers. John slowly began to stand up, pulling your weight as well as his own. </p><p>The deep orange of the fire was reflected in John&rsquo;s dark eyes. A flame had been lit, and anger and a desire for vengeance was seeping into every fiber of his being. This was an act that would not go unpunished.</p></p>",

                "content": "<p>okay but John Wick/Frank Castle though?</p><p>\n\n&bull;&nbsp; Both <i>love </i>dogs. Every time they&rsquo;re driving past a shelter and the one behind the wheel slows down hopefully, it&rsquo;s the responsibility of the other to sternly remind him,&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>no</i>.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>\n\n&bull;&nbsp; Both are almost definitely secret fans of classical music. John, raised in the world of ballet, is quite a talented pianist (The Director taught him until he was good enough to play for her girls&rsquo; rehearsals.) Frank likes to listen to him play at night, while he&rsquo;s cleaning his guns.<br /></p><p>\n\n&bull;&nbsp; Never once have they asked each other for help on a kill. They don&rsquo;t need to - they both seem to just know instinctively when the other is in trouble, and John will somehow just <i>show up </i>if Frank ever needs him, and vice versa.<br /></p><p>\n\n&bull;&nbsp; Frank likes to cook, and John is fussy about keeping the house neat. Frank will occasionally annoy him deliberately by leaving dishes in the sink, just because he thinks it&rsquo;s cute what a&nbsp;&ldquo;prissy, tidy little shit&rdquo; John is.<br /></p><p>\n\n&bull;&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t talk about Helen, ever. Or Maria.<br /></p><p>\n\n&bull;&nbsp; Their sex life is surprisingly gentle, despite what the very few who know about their relationship might assume. They&rsquo;ve both seen enough violence and rage and pain permeating literally every other aspect of their lives, in bed together they&rsquo;re tender and considerate with each other. They&rsquo;re both long since over being embarrassed about their natural instinct for cuddling.<br /></p><p>\n\n&bull;&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t go out much. Both to keep a low profile, and because they&rsquo;re both homebodies by nature. They like to stay in, make dinner for each other, watch old cowboy movies and do puzzles or play chess. John is the better player, but Frank is learning quickly. Sometimes when he pulls off a particularly clever move, John will smile faintly at him across the board and say softly,&nbsp;&ldquo;nice,&rdquo; and Frank&rsquo;s heart stutters.</p><p>\n\n&bull;&nbsp; Frank once watched John drive a screwdriver through the eyeball and deep into the brain of an Irish mafia enforcer in one brutal attack, and as the man collapsed shrieking and spurting blood before dying at their feet, John met Frank&rsquo;s eyes and said coolly,&nbsp;&ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t thaw the chicken before we left the house, did you.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a part of his lover that is capable of shutting off his emotions entirely to perform necessary tasks, and Frank isn&rsquo;t sure if he&rsquo;s more impressed or unnerved by this.<br /></p><p>\n\n&bull;&nbsp; They&rsquo;re both early risers, and will often wake up with the sun to go jogging or swimming together.
