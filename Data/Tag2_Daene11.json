His primary color is red all around his body. He\u2019s as big as Daenerys dragon Drogon. His wings go from red to black on the tips, his horns and spinal crest are black. He named him Elirion after mother who was murdered in the red keep he will do her murder justice. Oraxsus is your dragon she\u2019s black and blue and the smallest dragon out of all five that hatched that day. She has the same color pattern as Daenerys dragon Drogon but instead of red yours has blue. Yours had been born smaller then the rest and weaker something that worried you a lot. </p><p>\u201cCome on Oraxsus you have to eat.\u201d You pleaded our dragon who was refusing to eat out of your hand. You looked over at your brother Aegon who was successfully feeding his dragon. You looked back at your dragon in a huff and tried again but it wouldn\u2019t bite. Her breathing seemed to be raspy and weak. Your trailed your finger alongside her scaled body. \u201cI hope you\u2019re fine.\u201d You put her back in her little crate that you all had made for your dragons to be in. </p><p>\u201cYours won\u2019t eat either?\u201d Daenerys asked as she came to walk by you. You nodded and gave another quick glance to oraxsus. </p><p>\u201cYours do eat mine won\u2019t eat all I don\u2019t know why. But I also think she\u2019s not that well.\u201d You tell her and she hums in response. </p><p>\u201cWell it\u2019s not like we can do much about it but keep trying I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll get better.\u201d She said with a small smile for comfort. Her smile was short lived though because when she heard her horse die and fall to the ground that smile was replaced with a frown. She quickly ran over to it checking for any hope for it to still be alive. Aegons horse had died the day before due to the hot sun and the little food or water you all have left. Many horses had died for the same reasons but they weren\u2019t going to waste. Their meat is used for food for both all of you and now the Dragons. But eventually the food will run low and their looked to be no place in sight. </p><p>We sent three Dothraki men to go search the end of the red waste. In search for anything that isn\u2019t this. In order to the save the people we have we have to make scarficies like send our remaining horses along with them. </p><p>-</p><p>The sun was hot and what little air was blowing was hot as well. Your throat and lips were dry from the lack of water and the increasing heat. It was taking more time then you had wanted waiting for the three men we sent to return with sort of answer. You sat back to back with Aegon as you all waited. </p><p>Their was a distant sound of a horse approaching. It could just be a daydream you thought to yourself. But the footsteps only sounded louder as it closer. You turned your head and knew for sure that it was real. </p><p>\u201cAegon.\u201d You said calling out to him. He hummed in response and you moved your head to point to the approaching horse. He got up immediatly and you followed his actions too. Any sign of hope you had immediatly died down as you saw no rider on that horse. Ser Jorah approached it first with Aegon not far behind. The horse had red markings all around and seemed to have a bag on its side that was dripping. You slowly moved towards them and Daenerys was right beside you. Ser Jorah opened the bag and lifted what was inside just a little. You then saw the hair and then saw the liquid dripping from the bag and then quickly knew what had happened. They had beheaded him. Aegon turned his head and huffed out in frustration. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to see this.\u201d Ser Jorah said mainly directing his comment to Daenerys who all noticed what had happened. </p><p>\u201cHe is blood of my blood.\u201d She said as she stood by the horse. \u201cWho did this?\u201d She asked in anger. </p><p>\u201cKhal Pono perhaps, Khal Jhaqo they don\u2019t like the idea of three foreigners leading a khalasar.\u201d Ser Jorah pointed out. </p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll like it far less when we are done with them.\u201d  Daenerys said and you nodded your head in agreement. Irri rushed towards the horse and to the bag with Rakharo\u2019s head. Her sobs were loud as she fell to the ground. Daenerys took her in her arms trying to comfort her. She was saying that they had killed his soul because they didn\u2019t burn his body. Daenerys promised her that she will build a funeral pyre. You kneel down beside them feeling her pain. You don\u2019t know what you would do if Aegon got killed. You place a hand on top of her head and brush her hair with your fingers for comfort. You then start talking to her in Dothraki. </p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll know about us just you watch they\u2019ll soon regret the day they killed him and regret that they left our khalasar they\u2019ll soon know who the Targaryens truly are.\u201d</p><p>- </p><p>You wait again and again waiting for any of the other two bloodriders to come back. As you wait you sit and grab your dragon Oraxsus. You gently pet the top of her head. She\u2019s still weak and seems weaker then before. She won\u2019t even open her eyes today. You just see her little body move up and down very slow. </p><p>\u201cPlease wake up oraxsus come on you\u2019re a strong girl I know so.\u201d You whisper to her. You feel someone walk up behind you and sit by you. You turn your head and it\u2019s Daenerys. </p><p>\u201cIs she doing any better?\u201d She asks you and you look back at oraxsus. </p><p>\u201cNo she seems to be doing worse now.\u201d You can\u2019t help but feel warm tears threaten to fall. You couldn\u2019t help but think if you\u2019re doing something wrong or if you\u2019ve done something wrong. In such a little time you already feel attatched to this little dragon. You take a deep breath to try and calm yourself. You keep petting oraxsus until you don\u2019t hear any noise coming from her. You watch closely and don\u2019t see her chest moving anymore. You bring her little chest up to your ear and don\u2019t hear her heartbeat and don\u2019t feel her breath. The tears then return and this time they roll down your cheek. You look over at Daenerys who is still beside you. A sad look in your eyes something that she hasn\u2019t seen in you. And something you\u2019ve never showed her. </p><p>You don\u2019t have to say anything for her to know what was going on. You continue to try and pet  oraxsus as if that will do anything to her state. To see if with your touch she would wake up or return to life but she hasn\u2019t. You bring one hand and cover your mouth as your tears roll down faster. Daenerys wraps her arm around your shoulder and pulls you closer to her. With her other hand she lets it brush your hair as she tries to sooth you. Your cries turn into sobs but they aren\u2019t loud ones not wanting to let others see how you were. Not wanting to let them see you like this. You bring oraxsus lifeless body close to your chest. You then feel other arms wrap around you and you knew who\u2019s they were. </p><p>At Aegons touch it only seemed to make you feel worse. Your sobs becoming a little louder then they were. He doesn\u2019t say anything he just kisses the side of your head and comforts you. You didn\u2019t feel Daenerys leave your side.</p><p>You later buried your dragon. Daenerys and Aegon were by your side when you did. Your dragon dying also made you think about something you had read about dragons long ago when you were younger. Something that scared you just a little as you remembered it. But also something you don\u2019t want to believe in but theirs a little part of you that does. You had read that if dragons were born weak and died a little after birth then that meant that the person was of bad omen. But you also thought that was only in a book and that you shouldnt believe what it had said. You just let yourself wonder not telling anyone of your thoughts. That weren\u2019t true. Or atleast you hoped.</p><p>Daenerys being worried for you and your dragon and comforting you made you feel differently about her. She had announced that she would rule by the side of you and your brother something you didn\u2019t expect her to say but she did. She had always been kind to you but of course you were difficult. Maybe it\u2019s alright to trust her and not kill her. Maybe </p><p>-</p><p>\u201cThis isnt your horse.\u201d Daenerys said to the blood rider Kovarro that had returned. You stood up from where you were sitting and walked over to where they were. </p><p>\u201cIt was given to me by the thirteen the elders of Qarth.\u201d Kovarro said. </p><p>\u201cQarth?\u201d Aegon asked. </p><p>\u201cThree days to the east, on the sea.\u201d Kovarro answered. </p><p>\u201cWill they let us in?\u201d Daenerys asked him. </p><p>\u201cThey said they would be honored to recieve the mother of dragons and the Dragon queen and dragon king.\u201d He answered as he got bags that were on his horse. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you know of this place?\u201d Aegon asked Ser Jorah. </p><p>\u201cOnly that the desert around there walls is called the garden of bones. Everytime the qartheen shut their gates on a traveler the garden grows.\u201d </p><p>- </p><p>As we got closer to what Kovarro said was Qarth. Ser Jorah was right. The desert around the huge walls were huge. As we got close soilders came out from the gates and thirteen men followed behind them. </p><p>\u201cI thought we were welcome?\u201d Daenerys asked. </p><p>\u201cIf you heard a Dothraki horde was approaching your city you would do the same khaleesi.\u201d Ser Jorah said. You looked behind to the khalasar who was no horde at all. </p><p>\u201cHorde?\u201d You asked. </p><p>\u201cMy name is\u2014\u201d </p><p>\u201cYour name is Daenerys of house Targaryen and you are Aegon Of house Targaryen and you Y/N of house Targaryen.\u201d The man inturrpted casuing you to be confused on how he knew your names. Espically yours and Aegons.</p><p>\u201cYou know us my lord?\u201d Daenerys asked the man who Inturrpted her. </p><p>\u201cOnly by reputation Khaleesi and I\u2019m no lord merely a humble merchant. They call you the mother of dragons \u201d He said. You heard that name be called to her again \u2018the mother of dragons\u2019.It was a deserving name since she had three dragons and Aegon and you only had one. But it was still confusing on how fast they had thought of that name since you guys have been in a desert ever since they were born. </p><p>\u201cAnd what should we call you?\u201d She asked him. </p><p>\u201cOh my name is quite long and quite impossible for foreigners to pronounce I am simply a trader of spices.\u201d He responded still not really answering her question. \u201cBut we are the thirteen charged with the governance and protection of Qarth the greatest city that ever was or will be.\u201d He finished saying. You three looked at one another not knowing who was going to respond or how. </p><p>\u201cThe beauty of quarth is legendary\u2014-\u201c</p><p>\u201cQarth.\u201d He corrected her. </p><p>\u201cEh Qarth.\u201d She repeated saying it right this time. </p><p>\u201cMight we see the dragons?\u201d He asked. You three looked at eachother again and shared a knowing look and unspoken conversation. Aegon stepped up and spoke this time. </p><p>\u201cMy Friend we have traveled very far we have no food no water once we see our people fed we would be honored.\u201d Aegon told the man.</p><p>\u201cForgive me Dragon King But no man alive has seen a living dragon. Some of my more skeptical friends refuse to believe your children even exist. All we ask is a chance to see for ourselves.\u201d The man told Aegon. Aegon took a step closer trying to convince to man to let us all In. </p><p>\u201cTrust me I saw them being born we are NOT liars.\u201d Aegon responded his voice sounded annoyed at the man\u2019s persistence on not letting us In. </p><p>\u201cWell I don\u2019t think you are because I\u2019ve never met you before my opinion on the matter is of limited value.\u201d The man answered. </p><p>\u201cWhere we come from guests are treated with respect not insulted at the gates.\u201d Daenerys said also getting annoyed at the man. You were also getting annoyed all you wanted to do was atleast get some fresh water somewhere to be where it wasn\u2019t covered with sand. </p><p>\u201cPerhaps you should return where you came from we wish you well.\u201d He responded getting you mad now. He then turned his back and began to walk away. This got you even more angry. They had broken the promise of letting you in and had insulted you all in the front gates. You walked forward to stand next to Aegon as he watched them walk away with an angry scowl on his face. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d Daenerys asked beating you to the question. The man from before turned and faced you three. \u201cYou promised to receive us!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe have recieved you here we are and here you are.\u201d The man answered. </p><p>\u201cIf you do not let us in all of us we will die!\u201d Daenerys told him with anger in her tone. </p><p>\u201cWhich we shall deeply regret. But Qarth did not become the greatest city that ever was or will be by letting Dothraki savages through its gates.\u201d The man said unbothered by what Daenerys had said and continued to walk away. You\u2019ve had enough of this man so you spoke up this time. Ser Jorah seemed to notice what you were planning to do so he walked beside you. </p><p>\u201cMy Queen please be careful.\u201d He warned you as he walked beside you. </p><p>\u201cY/N what are you doing?\u201d Aegon asked in a whisper. </p><p>\u201cThirteen! Remember our Faces and our Names! We are the Targaryens and when our Dragons are grown we will take back what was stolen from us! We will destroy those who have wronged us! We will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground! Turn us away and we will burn you first!\u201d You warned them catching their attention once more and causing them to stop in their tracks. </p><p>\u201cAh you are a true Targaryen, only as the mother of dragons said a moment ago if we don\u2019t let you into the city, you will all die. And so&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cRetreating In fear from a little girl is unbecoming of the greatest city that ever was or will be.\u201d One of the thirteen said stepping up front and next to the spice merchant. </p><p>\u201cThe discussion is over Xaro Xhoan Doxas. The thirteen have spoken.\u201d The merchant told the man looking angered that he had stepped up. </p><p>\u201cI am one of the thirteen and I am still speaking.\u201d He told him. </p><p>\u201cThe girl threatens to burn our city to the ground and you shall invite them in for a cup of wine?\u201d The merchant told him. </p><p>\u201cShe is the dragon queen do you expect her to watch her people to starve without breathing fire? I believe we can allow a few Dothraki through our gates without dooming our city. After all, here I am, a savage from the summer isles and Qarth still stands.\u201d Xaro Xhoan Daxos said trying to convince the merchant. You looked over at Aegon and Ser Jorah not knowing to what to do at this matter as you heard them argue. </p><p>\u201cOur decision is final.\u201d The merchant continued saying. This man really is scared of us isn\u2019t he?</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Xaro Xhoan Daxos said as he took a step forward and taking his sword out from its sheath. \u201cI invoke soumai. I will vouch for them, her people and their dragons in accordance with the law.\u201d He then proceeded to cut his hand. You were watching Intenly passing a glance over to Aegon and Daenerys. </p><p>\u201cBe it on your head.\u201d The merchant said as he saw the cut on Xaro Xhoan Daxos palm before storming off to stand to the side.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to Qarth.\u201d </p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>. </p>",

But eventually the food will run low and their looked to be no place in sight. </p><p>We sent three Dothraki men to go search the end of the red waste. In search for anything that isn\u2019t this. In order to the save the people we have we have to make scarficies like send our remaining horses along with them. </p><p>-</p><p>The sun was hot and what little air was blowing was hot as well. Your throat and lips were dry from the lack of water and the increasing heat. It was taking more time then you had wanted waiting for the three men we sent to return with sort of answer. You sat back to back with Aegon as you all waited. </p><p>Their was a distant sound of a horse approaching. It could just be a daydream you thought to yourself. But the footsteps only sounded louder as it closer. You turned your head and knew for sure that it was real. </p><p>\u201cAegon.\u201d You said calling out to him. He hummed in response and you moved your head to point to the approaching horse. He got up immediatly and you followed his actions too. Any sign of hope you had immediatly died down as you saw no rider on that horse. Ser Jorah approached it first with Aegon not far behind. The horse had red markings all around and seemed to have a bag on its side that was dripping. You slowly moved towards them and Daenerys was right beside you. Ser Jorah opened the bag and lifted what was inside just a little. You then saw the hair and then saw the liquid dripping from the bag and then quickly knew what had happened. They had beheaded him. Aegon turned his head and huffed out in frustration. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to see this.\u201d Ser Jorah said mainly directing his comment to Daenerys who all noticed what had happened. </p><p>\u201cHe is blood of my blood.\u201d She said as she stood by the horse. \u201cWho did this?\u201d She asked in anger. </p><p>\u201cKhal Pono perhaps, Khal Jhaqo they don\u2019t like the idea of three foreigners leading a khalasar.\u201d Ser Jorah pointed out. </p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll like it far less when we are done with them.\u201d  Daenerys said and you nodded your head in agreement. Irri rushed towards the horse and to the bag with Rakharo\u2019s head. Her sobs were loud as she fell to the ground. Daenerys took her in her arms trying to comfort her. She was saying that they had killed his soul because they didn\u2019t burn his body. Daenerys promised her that she will build a funeral pyre. You kneel down beside them feeling her pain. You don\u2019t know what you would do if Aegon got killed. You place a hand on top of her head and brush her hair with your fingers for comfort. You then start talking to her in Dothraki. </p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll know about us just you watch they\u2019ll soon regret the day they killed him and regret that they left our khalasar they\u2019ll soon know who the Targaryens truly are.\u201d</p><p>- </p><p>You wait again and again waiting for any of the other two bloodriders to come back. As you wait you sit and grab your dragon Oraxsus. You gently pet the top of her head. She\u2019s still weak and seems weaker then before. She won\u2019t even open her eyes today. You just see her little body move up and down very slow. </p><p>\u201cPlease wake up oraxsus come on you\u2019re a strong girl I know so.\u201d You whisper to her. You feel someone walk up behind you and sit by you. You turn your head and it\u2019s Daenerys. </p><p>\u201cIs she doing any better?\u201d She asks you and you look back at oraxsus. </p><p>\u201cNo she seems to be doing worse now.\u201d You can\u2019t help but feel warm tears threaten to fall. You couldn\u2019t help but think if you\u2019re doing something wrong or if you\u2019ve done something wrong. In such a little time you already feel attatched to this little dragon. You take a deep breath to try and calm yourself. You keep petting oraxsus until you don\u2019t hear any noise coming from her. You watch closely and don\u2019t see her chest moving anymore. You bring her little chest up to your ear and don\u2019t hear her heartbeat and don\u2019t feel her breath. The tears then return and this time they roll down your cheek. You look over at Daenerys who is still beside you. A sad look in your eyes something that she hasn\u2019t seen in you. And something you\u2019ve never showed her. </p><p>You don\u2019t have to say anything for her to know what was going on. You continue to try and pet  oraxsus as if that will do anything to her state. To see if with your touch she would wake up or return to life but she hasn\u2019t. You bring one hand and cover your mouth as your tears roll down faster. Daenerys wraps her arm around your shoulder and pulls you closer to her. With her other hand she lets it brush your hair as she tries to sooth you. Your cries turn into sobs but they aren\u2019t loud ones not wanting to let others see how you were. Not wanting to let them see you like this. You bring oraxsus lifeless body close to your chest. You then feel other arms wrap around you and you knew who\u2019s they were. </p><p>At Aegons touch it only seemed to make you feel worse. Your sobs becoming a little louder then they were. He doesn\u2019t say anything he just kisses the side of your head and comforts you. You didn\u2019t feel Daenerys leave your side.</p><p>You later buried your dragon. Daenerys and Aegon were by your side when you did. Your dragon dying also made you think about something you had read about dragons long ago when you were younger. Something that scared you just a little as you remembered it. But also something you don\u2019t want to believe in but theirs a little part of you that does. You had read that if dragons were born weak and died a little after birth then that meant that the person was of bad omen. But you also thought that was only in a book and that you shouldnt believe what it had said. You just let yourself wonder not telling anyone of your thoughts. That weren\u2019t true. Or atleast you hoped.</p><p>Daenerys being worried for you and your dragon and comforting you made you feel differently about her. She had announced that she would rule by the side of you and your brother something you didn\u2019t expect her to say but she did. She had always been kind to you but of course you were difficult. Maybe it\u2019s alright to trust her and not kill her. Maybe </p><p>-</p><p>\u201cThis isnt your horse.\u201d Daenerys said to the blood rider Kovarro that had returned. You stood up from where you were sitting and walked over to where they were. </p><p>\u201cIt was given to me by the thirteen the elders of Qarth.\u201d Kovarro said. </p><p>\u201cQarth?\u201d Aegon asked. </p><p>\u201cThree days to the east, on the sea.\u201d Kovarro answered. </p><p>\u201cWill they let us in?\u201d Daenerys asked him. </p><p>\u201cThey said they would be honored to recieve the mother of dragons and the Dragon queen and dragon king.\u201d He answered as he got bags that were on his horse. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you know of this place?\u201d Aegon asked Ser Jorah. </p><p>\u201cOnly that the desert around there walls is called the garden of bones. Everytime the qartheen shut their gates on a traveler the garden grows.\u201d </p><p>- </p><p>As we got closer to what Kovarro said was Qarth. Ser Jorah was right. The desert around the huge walls were huge. As we got close soilders came out from the gates and thirteen men followed behind them. </p><p>\u201cI thought we were welcome?\u201d Daenerys asked. </p><p>\u201cIf you heard a Dothraki horde was approaching your city you would do the same khaleesi.\u201d Ser Jorah said. You looked behind to the khalasar who was no horde at all. </p><p>\u201cHorde?\u201d You asked. </p><p>\u201cMy name is\u2014\u201d </p><p>\u201cYour name is Daenerys of house Targaryen and you are Aegon Of house Targaryen and you Y/N of house Targaryen.\u201d The man inturrpted casuing you to be confused on how he knew your names. Espically yours and Aegons.</p><p>\u201cYou know us my lord?\u201d Daenerys asked the man who Inturrpted her. </p><p>\u201cOnly by reputation Khaleesi and I\u2019m no lord merely a humble merchant. They call you the mother of dragons \u201d He said. You heard that name be called to her again \u2018the mother of dragons\u2019.It was a deserving name since she had three dragons and Aegon and you only had one. But it was still confusing on how fast they had thought of that name since you guys have been in a desert ever since they were born. </p><p>\u201cAnd what should we call you?\u201d She asked him. </p><p>\u201cOh my name is quite long and quite impossible for foreigners to pronounce I am simply a trader of spices.\u201d He responded still not really answering her question. \u201cBut we are the thirteen charged with the governance and protection of Qarth the greatest city that ever was or will be.\u201d He finished saying. You three looked at one another not knowing who was going to respond or how. </p><p>\u201cThe beauty of quarth is legendary\u2014-\u201c</p><p>\u201cQarth.\u201d He corrected her. </p><p>\u201cEh Qarth.\u201d She repeated saying it right this time. </p><p>\u201cMight we see the dragons?\u201d He asked. You three looked at eachother again and shared a knowing look and unspoken conversation. Aegon stepped up and spoke this time. </p><p>\u201cMy Friend we have traveled very far we have no food no water once we see our people fed we would be honored.\u201d Aegon told the man.</p><p>\u201cForgive me Dragon King But no man alive has seen a living dragon. Some of my more skeptical friends refuse to believe your children even exist. All we ask is a chance to see for ourselves.\u201d The man told Aegon. Aegon took a step closer trying to convince to man to let us all In. </p><p>\u201cTrust me I saw them being born we are NOT liars.\u201d Aegon responded his voice sounded annoyed at the man\u2019s persistence on not letting us In. </p><p>\u201cWell I don\u2019t think you are because I\u2019ve never met you before my opinion on the matter is of limited value.\u201d The man answered. </p><p>\u201cWhere we come from guests are treated with respect not insulted at the gates.\u201d Daenerys said also getting annoyed at the man. You were also getting annoyed all you wanted to do was atleast get some fresh water somewhere to be where it wasn\u2019t covered with sand. </p><p>\u201cPerhaps you should return where you came from we wish you well.\u201d He responded getting you mad now. He then turned his back and began to walk away. This got you even more angry. They had broken the promise of letting you in and had insulted you all in the front gates. You walked forward to stand next to Aegon as he watched them walk away with an angry scowl on his face. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d Daenerys asked beating you to the question. The man from before turned and faced you three. \u201cYou promised to receive us!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe have recieved you here we are and here you are.\u201d The man answered. </p><p>\u201cIf you do not let us in all of us we will die!\u201d Daenerys told him with anger in her tone. </p><p>\u201cWhich we shall deeply regret. But Qarth did not become the greatest city that ever was or will be by letting Dothraki savages through its gates.\u201d The man said unbothered by what Daenerys had said and continued to walk away. You\u2019ve had enough of this man so you spoke up this time. Ser Jorah seemed to notice what you were planning to do so he walked beside you. </p><p>\u201cMy Queen please be careful.\u201d He warned you as he walked beside you. </p><p>\u201cY/N what are you doing?\u201d Aegon asked in a whisper. </p><p>\u201cThirteen! Remember our Faces and our Names! We are the Targaryens and when our Dragons are grown we will take back what was stolen from us! We will destroy those who have wronged us! We will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground! Turn us away and we will burn you first!\u201d You warned them catching their attention once more and causing them to stop in their tracks. </p><p>\u201cAh you are a true Targaryen, only as the mother of dragons said a moment ago if we don\u2019t let you into the city, you will all die. And so\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cRetreating In fear from a little girl is unbecoming of the greatest city that ever was or will be.\u201d One of the thirteen said stepping up front and next to the spice merchant. </p><p>\u201cThe discussion is over Xaro Xhoan Doxas. The thirteen have spoken.\u201d The merchant told the man looking angered that he had stepped up. </p><p>\u201cI am one of the thirteen and I am still speaking.\u201d He told him. </p><p>\u201cThe girl threatens to burn our city to the ground and you shall invite them in for a cup of wine?\u201d The merchant told him. </p><p>\u201cShe is the dragon queen do you expect her to watch her people to starve without breathing fire? I believe we can allow a few Dothraki through our gates without dooming our city. After all, here I am, a savage from the summer isles and Qarth still stands.\u201d Xaro Xhoan Daxos said trying to convince the merchant. You looked over at Aegon and Ser Jorah not knowing to what to do at this matter as you heard them argue. </p><p>\u201cOur decision is final.\u201d The merchant continued saying. This man really is scared of us isn\u2019t he?</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Xaro Xhoan Daxos said as he took a step forward and taking his sword out from its sheath. \u201cI invoke soumai. I will vouch for them, her people and their dragons in accordance with the law.\u201d He then proceeded to cut his hand. You were watching Intenly passing a glance over to Aegon and Daenerys. </p><p>\u201cBe it on your head.\u201d The merchant said as he saw the cut on Xaro Xhoan Daxos palm before storming off to stand to the side.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to Qarth.\u201d </p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>. </p></p>",

His primary color is red all around his body. He\u2019s as big as Daenerys dragon Drogon. His wings go from red to black on the tips, his horns and spinal crest are black. He named him Elirion after mother who was murdered in the red keep he will do her murder justice. Oraxsus is your dragon she\u2019s black and blue and the smallest dragon out of all five that hatched that day. She has the same color pattern as Daenerys dragon Drogon but instead of red yours has blue. Yours had been born smaller then the rest and weaker something that worried you a lot. </p><p>\u201cCome on Oraxsus you have to eat.\u201d You pleaded our dragon who was refusing to eat out of your hand. You looked over at your brother Aegon who was successfully feeding his dragon. You looked back at your dragon in a huff and tried again but it wouldn\u2019t bite. Her breathing seemed to be raspy and weak. Your trailed your finger alongside her scaled body. \u201cI hope you\u2019re fine.\u201d You put her back in her little crate that you all had made for your dragons to be in. </p><p>\u201cYours won\u2019t eat either?\u201d Daenerys asked as she came to walk by you. You nodded and gave another quick glance to oraxsus. </p><p>\u201cYours do eat mine won\u2019t eat all I don\u2019t know why. But I also think she\u2019s not that well.\u201d You tell her and she hums in response. </p><p>\u201cWell it\u2019s not like we can do much about it but keep trying I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll get better.\u201d She said with a small smile for comfort. Her smile was short lived though because when she heard her horse die and fall to the ground that smile was replaced with a frown. She quickly ran over to it checking for any hope for it to still be alive. Aegons horse had died the day before due to the hot sun and the little food or water you all have left. Many horses had died for the same reasons but they weren\u2019t going to waste. Their meat is used for food for both all of you and now the Dragons. But eventually the food will run low and their looked to be no place in sight. </p><p>We sent three Dothraki men to go search the end of the red waste. In search for anything that isn\u2019t this. In order to the save the people we have we have to make scarficies like send our remaining horses along with them. </p><p>-</p><p>The sun was hot and what little air was blowing was hot as well. Your throat and lips were dry from the lack of water and the increasing heat. It was taking more time then you had wanted waiting for the three men we sent to return with sort of answer. You sat back to back with Aegon as you all waited. </p><p>Their was a distant sound of a horse approaching. It could just be a daydream you thought to yourself. But the footsteps only sounded louder as it closer. You turned your head and knew for sure that it was real. </p><p>\u201cAegon.\u201d You said calling out to him. He hummed in response and you moved your head to point to the approaching horse. He got up immediatly and you followed his actions too. Any sign of hope you had immediatly died down as you saw no rider on that horse. Ser Jorah approached it first with Aegon not far behind. The horse had red markings all around and seemed to have a bag on its side that was dripping. You slowly moved towards them and Daenerys was right beside you. Ser Jorah opened the bag and lifted what was inside just a little. You then saw the hair and then saw the liquid dripping from the bag and then quickly knew what had happened. They had beheaded him. Aegon turned his head and huffed out in frustration. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to see this.\u201d Ser Jorah said mainly directing his comment to Daenerys who all noticed what had happened. </p><p>\u201cHe is blood of my blood.\u201d She said as she stood by the horse. \u201cWho did this?\u201d She asked in anger. </p><p>\u201cKhal Pono perhaps, Khal Jhaqo they don\u2019t like the idea of three foreigners leading a khalasar.\u201d Ser Jorah pointed out. </p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll like it far less when we are done with them.\u201d  Daenerys said and you nodded your head in agreement. Irri rushed towards the horse and to the bag with Rakharo\u2019s head. Her sobs were loud as she fell to the ground. Daenerys took her in her arms trying to comfort her. She was saying that they had killed his soul because they didn\u2019t burn his body. Daenerys promised her that she will build a funeral pyre. You kneel down beside them feeling her pain. You don\u2019t know what you would do if Aegon got killed. You place a hand on top of her head and brush her hair with your fingers for comfort. You then start talking to her in Dothraki. </p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll know about us just you watch they\u2019ll soon regret the day they killed him and regret that they left our khalasar they\u2019ll soon know who the Targaryens truly are.\u201d</p><p>- </p><p>You wait again and again waiting for any of the other two bloodriders to come back. As you wait you sit and grab your dragon Oraxsus. You gently pet the top of her head. She\u2019s still weak and seems weaker then before. She won\u2019t even open her eyes today. You just see her little body move up and down very slow. </p><p>\u201cPlease wake up oraxsus come on you\u2019re a strong girl I know so.\u201d You whisper to her. You feel someone walk up behind you and sit by you. You turn your head and it\u2019s Daenerys. </p><p>\u201cIs she doing any better?\u201d She asks you and you look back at oraxsus. </p><p>\u201cNo she seems to be doing worse now.\u201d You can\u2019t help but feel warm tears threaten to fall. You couldn\u2019t help but think if you\u2019re doing something wrong or if you\u2019ve done something wrong. In such a little time you already feel attatched to this little dragon. You take a deep breath to try and calm yourself. You keep petting oraxsus until you don\u2019t hear any noise coming from her. You watch closely and don\u2019t see her chest moving anymore. You bring her little chest up to your ear and don\u2019t hear her heartbeat and don\u2019t feel her breath. The tears then return and this time they roll down your cheek. You look over at Daenerys who is still beside you. A sad look in your eyes something that she hasn\u2019t seen in you. And something you\u2019ve never showed her. </p><p>You don\u2019t have to say anything for her to know what was going on. You continue to try and pet  oraxsus as if that will do anything to her state. To see if with your touch she would wake up or return to life but she hasn\u2019t. You bring one hand and cover your mouth as your tears roll down faster. Daenerys wraps her arm around your shoulder and pulls you closer to her. With her other hand she lets it brush your hair as she tries to sooth you. Your cries turn into sobs but they aren\u2019t loud ones not wanting to let others see how you were. Not wanting to let them see you like this. You bring oraxsus lifeless body close to your chest. You then feel other arms wrap around you and you knew who\u2019s they were. </p><p>At Aegons touch it only seemed to make you feel worse. Your sobs becoming a little louder then they were. He doesn\u2019t say anything he just kisses the side of your head and comforts you. You didn\u2019t feel Daenerys leave your side.</p><p>You later buried your dragon. Daenerys and Aegon were by your side when you did. Your dragon dying also made you think about something you had read about dragons long ago when you were younger. Something that scared you just a little as you remembered it. But also something you don\u2019t want to believe in but theirs a little part of you that does. You had read that if dragons were born weak and died a little after birth then that meant that the person was of bad omen. But you also thought that was only in a book and that you shouldnt believe what it had said. You just let yourself wonder not telling anyone of your thoughts. That weren\u2019t true. Or atleast you hoped.</p><p>Daenerys being worried for you and your dragon and comforting you made you feel differently about her. She had announced that she would rule by the side of you and your brother something you didn\u2019t expect her to say but she did. She had always been kind to you but of course you were difficult. Maybe it\u2019s alright to trust her and not kill her. Maybe </p><p>-</p><p>\u201cThis isnt your horse.\u201d Daenerys said to the blood rider Kovarro that had returned. You stood up from where you were sitting and walked over to where they were. </p><p>\u201cIt was given to me by the thirteen the elders of Qarth.\u201d Kovarro said. </p><p>\u201cQarth?\u201d Aegon asked. </p><p>\u201cThree days to the east, on the sea.\u201d Kovarro answered. </p><p>\u201cWill they let us in?\u201d Daenerys asked him. </p><p>\u201cThey said they would be honored to recieve the mother of dragons and the Dragon queen and dragon king.\u201d He answered as he got bags that were on his horse. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you know of this place?\u201d Aegon asked Ser Jorah. </p><p>\u201cOnly that the desert around there walls is called the garden of bones. Everytime the qartheen shut their gates on a traveler the garden grows.\u201d </p><p>- </p><p>As we got closer to what Kovarro said was Qarth. Ser Jorah was right. The desert around the huge walls were huge. As we got close soilders came out from the gates and thirteen men followed behind them. </p><p>\u201cI thought we were welcome?\u201d Daenerys asked. </p><p>\u201cIf you heard a Dothraki horde was approaching your city you would do the same khaleesi.\u201d Ser Jorah said. You looked behind to the khalasar who was no horde at all. </p><p>\u201cHorde?\u201d You asked. </p><p>\u201cMy name is\u2014\u201d </p><p>\u201cYour name is Daenerys of house Targaryen and you are Aegon Of house Targaryen and you Y/N of house Targaryen.\u201d The man inturrpted casuing you to be confused on how he knew your names. Espically yours and Aegons.</p><p>\u201cYou know us my lord?\u201d Daenerys asked the man who Inturrpted her. </p><p>\u201cOnly by reputation Khaleesi and I\u2019m no lord merely a humble merchant. They call you the mother of dragons \u201d He said. You heard that name be called to her again \u2018the mother of dragons\u2019.It was a deserving name since she had three dragons and Aegon and you only had one. But it was still confusing on how fast they had thought of that name since you guys have been in a desert ever since they were born. </p><p>\u201cAnd what should we call you?\u201d She asked him. </p><p>\u201cOh my name is quite long and quite impossible for foreigners to pronounce I am simply a trader of spices.\u201d He responded still not really answering her question. \u201cBut we are the thirteen charged with the governance and protection of Qarth the greatest city that ever was or will be.\u201d He finished saying. You three looked at one another not knowing who was going to respond or how. </p><p>\u201cThe beauty of quarth is legendary\u2014-\u201c</p><p>\u201cQarth.\u201d He corrected her. </p><p>\u201cEh Qarth.\u201d She repeated saying it right this time. </p><p>\u201cMight we see the dragons?\u201d He asked. You three looked at eachother again and shared a knowing look and unspoken conversation. Aegon stepped up and spoke this time. </p><p>\u201cMy Friend we have traveled very far we have no food no water once we see our people fed we would be honored.\u201d Aegon told the man.</p><p>\u201cForgive me Dragon King But no man alive has seen a living dragon. Some of my more skeptical friends refuse to believe your children even exist. All we ask is a chance to see for ourselves.\u201d The man told Aegon. Aegon took a step closer trying to convince to man to let us all In. </p><p>\u201cTrust me I saw them being born we are NOT liars.\u201d Aegon responded his voice sounded annoyed at the man\u2019s persistence on not letting us In. </p><p>\u201cWell I don\u2019t think you are because I\u2019ve never met you before my opinion on the matter is of limited value.\u201d The man answered. </p><p>\u201cWhere we come from guests are treated with respect not insulted at the gates.\u201d Daenerys said also getting annoyed at the man. You were also getting annoyed all you wanted to do was atleast get some fresh water somewhere to be where it wasn\u2019t covered with sand. </p><p>\u201cPerhaps you should return where you came from we wish you well.\u201d He responded getting you mad now. He then turned his back and began to walk away. This got you even more angry. They had broken the promise of letting you in and had insulted you all in the front gates. You walked forward to stand next to Aegon as he watched them walk away with an angry scowl on his face. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d Daenerys asked beating you to the question. The man from before turned and faced you three. \u201cYou promised to receive us!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe have recieved you here we are and here you are.\u201d The man answered. </p><p>\u201cIf you do not let us in all of us we will die!\u201d Daenerys told him with anger in her tone. </p><p>\u201cWhich we shall deeply regret. But Qarth did not become the greatest city that ever was or will be by letting Dothraki savages through its gates.\u201d The man said unbothered by what Daenerys had said and continued to walk away. You\u2019ve had enough of this man so you spoke up this time. Ser Jorah seemed to notice what you were planning to do so he walked beside you. </p><p>\u201cMy Queen please be careful.\u201d He warned you as he walked beside you. </p><p>\u201cY/N what are you doing?\u201d Aegon asked in a whisper. </p><p>\u201cThirteen! Remember our Faces and our Names! We are the Targaryens and when our Dragons are grown we will take back what was stolen from us! We will destroy those who have wronged us! We will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground! Turn us away and we will burn you first!\u201d You warned them catching their attention once more and causing them to stop in their tracks. </p><p>\u201cAh you are a true Targaryen, only as the mother of dragons said a moment ago if we don\u2019t let you into the city, you will all die. And so\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cRetreating In fear from a little girl is unbecoming of the greatest city that ever was or will be.\u201d One of the thirteen said stepping up front and next to the spice merchant. </p><p>\u201cThe discussion is over Xaro Xhoan Doxas. The thirteen have spoken.\u201d The merchant told the man looking angered that he had stepped up. </p><p>\u201cI am one of the thirteen and I am still speaking.\u201d He told him. </p><p>\u201cThe girl threatens to burn our city to the ground and you shall invite them in for a cup of wine?\u201d The merchant told him. </p><p>\u201cShe is the dragon queen do you expect her to watch her people to starve without breathing fire? I believe we can allow a few Dothraki through our gates without dooming our city. After all, here I am, a savage from the summer isles and Qarth still stands.\u201d Xaro Xhoan Daxos said trying to convince the merchant. You looked over at Aegon and Ser Jorah not knowing to what to do at this matter as you heard them argue. </p><p>\u201cOur decision is final.\u201d The merchant continued saying. This man really is scared of us isn\u2019t he?</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Xaro Xhoan Daxos said as he took a step forward and taking his sword out from its sheath. \u201cI invoke soumai. I will vouch for them, her people and their dragons in accordance with the law.\u201d He then proceeded to cut his hand. You were watching Intenly passing a glance over to Aegon and Daenerys. </p><p>\u201cBe it on your head.\u201d The merchant said as he saw the cut on Xaro Xhoan Daxos palm before storming off to stand to the side.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to Qarth.\u201d </p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>. </p></p>",

His primary color is red all around his body. He&rsquo;s as big as Daenerys dragon Drogon. His wings go from red to black on the tips, his horns and spinal crest are black. He named him Elirion after mother who was murdered in the red keep he will do her murder justice. Oraxsus is your dragon she&rsquo;s black and blue and the smallest dragon out of all five that hatched that day. She has the same color pattern as Daenerys dragon Drogon but instead of red yours has blue. Yours had been born smaller then the rest and weaker something that worried you a lot. </p><p>&ldquo;Come on Oraxsus you have to eat.&rdquo; You pleaded our dragon who was refusing to eat out of your hand. You looked over at your brother Aegon who was successfully feeding his dragon. You looked back at your dragon in a huff and tried again but it wouldn&rsquo;t bite. Her breathing seemed to be raspy and weak. Your trailed your finger alongside her scaled body. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re fine.&rdquo; You put her back in her little crate that you all had made for your dragons to be in. </p><p>&ldquo;Yours won&rsquo;t eat either?&rdquo; Daenerys asked as she came to walk by you. You nodded and gave another quick glance to oraxsus. </p><p>&ldquo;Yours do eat mine won&rsquo;t eat all I don&rsquo;t know why. But I also think she&rsquo;s not that well.&rdquo; You tell her and she hums in response. </p><p>&ldquo;Well it&rsquo;s not like we can do much about it but keep trying I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll get better.&rdquo; She said with a small smile for comfort. Her smile was short lived though because when she heard her horse die and fall to the ground that smile was replaced with a frown. She quickly ran over to it checking for any hope for it to still be alive. Aegons horse had died the day before due to the hot sun and the little food or water you all have left. Many horses had died for the same reasons but they weren&rsquo;t going to waste. Their meat is used for food for both all of you and now the Dragons. But eventually the food will run low and their looked to be no place in sight. </p><p>We sent three Dothraki men to go search the end of the red waste. In search for anything that isn&rsquo;t this. In order to the save the people we have we have to make scarficies like send our remaining horses along with them. </p><p>-</p><p>The sun was hot and what little air was blowing was hot as well. Your throat and lips were dry from the lack of water and the increasing heat. It was taking more time then you had wanted waiting for the three men we sent to return with sort of answer. You sat back to back with Aegon as you all waited. </p><p>Their was a distant sound of a horse approaching. It could just be a daydream you thought to yourself. But the footsteps only sounded louder as it closer. You turned your head and knew for sure that it was real. </p><p>&ldquo;Aegon.&rdquo; You said calling out to him. He hummed in response and you moved your head to point to the approaching horse. He got up immediatly and you followed his actions too. Any sign of hope you had immediatly died down as you saw no rider on that horse. Ser Jorah approached it first with Aegon not far behind. The horse had red markings all around and seemed to have a bag on its side that was dripping. You slowly moved towards them and Daenerys was right beside you. Ser Jorah opened the bag and lifted what was inside just a little. You then saw the hair and then saw the liquid dripping from the bag and then quickly knew what had happened. They had beheaded him. Aegon turned his head and huffed out in frustration. </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to see this.&rdquo; Ser Jorah said mainly directing his comment to Daenerys who all noticed what had happened. </p><p>&ldquo;He is blood of my blood.&rdquo; She said as she stood by the horse. &ldquo;Who did this?&rdquo; She asked in anger. </p><p>&ldquo;Khal Pono perhaps, Khal Jhaqo they don&rsquo;t like the idea of three foreigners leading a khalasar.&rdquo; Ser Jorah pointed out. </p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll like it far less when we are done with them.&rdquo;  Daenerys said and you nodded your head in agreement. Irri rushed towards the horse and to the bag with Rakharo&rsquo;s head. Her sobs were loud as she fell to the ground. Daenerys took her in her arms trying to comfort her. She was saying that they had killed his soul because they didn&rsquo;t burn his body. Daenerys promised her that she will build a funeral pyre. You kneel down beside them feeling her pain. You don&rsquo;t know what you would do if Aegon got killed. You place a hand on top of her head and brush her hair with your fingers for comfort. You then start talking to her in Dothraki. </p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll know about us just you watch they&rsquo;ll soon regret the day they killed him and regret that they left our khalasar they&rsquo;ll soon know who the Targaryens truly are.&rdquo;</p><p>- </p><p>You wait again and again waiting for any of the other two bloodriders to come back. As you wait you sit and grab your dragon Oraxsus. You gently pet the top of her head. She&rsquo;s still weak and seems weaker then before. She won&rsquo;t even open her eyes today. You just see her little body move up and down very slow. </p><p>&ldquo;Please wake up oraxsus come on you&rsquo;re a strong girl I know so.&rdquo; You whisper to her. You feel someone walk up behind you and sit by you. You turn your head and it&rsquo;s Daenerys. </p><p>&ldquo;Is she doing any better?&rdquo; She asks you and you look back at oraxsus. </p><p>&ldquo;No she seems to be doing worse now.&rdquo; You can&rsquo;t help but feel warm tears threaten to fall. You couldn&rsquo;t help but think if you&rsquo;re doing something wrong or if you&rsquo;ve done something wrong. In such a little time you already feel attatched to this little dragon. You take a deep breath to try and calm yourself. You keep petting oraxsus until you don&rsquo;t hear any noise coming from her. You watch closely and don&rsquo;t see her chest moving anymore. You bring her little chest up to your ear and don&rsquo;t hear her heartbeat and don&rsquo;t feel her breath. The tears then return and this time they roll down your cheek. You look over at Daenerys who is still beside you. A sad look in your eyes something that she hasn&rsquo;t seen in you. And something you&rsquo;ve never showed her. </p><p>You don&rsquo;t have to say anything for her to know what was going on. You continue to try and pet  oraxsus as if that will do anything to her state. To see if with your touch she would wake up or return to life but she hasn&rsquo;t. You bring one hand and cover your mouth as your tears roll down faster. Daenerys wraps her arm around your shoulder and pulls you closer to her. With her other hand she lets it brush your hair as she tries to sooth you. Your cries turn into sobs but they aren&rsquo;t loud ones not wanting to let others see how you were. Not wanting to let them see you like this. You bring oraxsus lifeless body close to your chest. You then feel other arms wrap around you and you knew who&rsquo;s they were. </p><p>At Aegons touch it only seemed to make you feel worse. Your sobs becoming a little louder then they were. He doesn&rsquo;t say anything he just kisses the side of your head and comforts you. You didn&rsquo;t feel Daenerys leave your side.</p><p>You later buried your dragon. Daenerys and Aegon were by your side when you did. Your dragon dying also made you think about something you had read about dragons long ago when you were younger. Something that scared you just a little as you remembered it. But also something you don&rsquo;t want to believe in but theirs a little part of you that does.
