As we all know, Arya rode to Storm\u2019s End after King\u2019s Landing and confessed her love to Gendry but confided in him her insecurities about her inability to be the \u201cproper lady\u201d he deserves. Gendry convinced her that he doesn\u2019t want a \u201cproper lady,\u201d and that he wasn\u2019t asking her to give up her independence and agency to marry him\u2013he was asking her to let him love her for who she is, to rule as his equal and be the good leader she\u2019s always known in her heart she could be. They got married in a secret ceremony with only Davos as witness. Arya had to go back to Winterfell to help her family free Jon while Gendry stayed in SE to get acquainted with his lordship duties. While apart, they corresponded daily via raven and Arya admitted to Gendry that her restlessness and night terrors were getting worse to the point where she could barely function, so together, they decided that she should leave Westeros for a while so she could heal properly from her trauma without the added stress of leadership responsibilities. The council meeting happened and they went public with their marriage (the claw marks on Gendry\u2019s doublet <i>were not subtle</i>), they enjoyed a second honeymoon by banging all over SE while her ship was being built, then she set sail while Gendry stayed behind to rule over the Stormlands during the transition into King Bran\u2019s rule. Arya sailed for a year, discovered that West of Westeros is actually just East of Essos (they all had a good laugh about that), then she came back to SE tanned and ready to help Gendry lead their people (and learn how to use a fork). Arya and Gendry became the most beloved lord and lady in the history of the Stormlands, they had multiple children due to all the rabbit sex (their firstborn being a daughter who inherited SE because Arya put an end to male-only primogeniture), and they lived happily ever after.</p><p>What part of this is making people doubt gendrya is canon?

                "content": "<p>Of course it is! As we all know, Arya rode to Storm&rsquo;s End after King&rsquo;s Landing and confessed her love to Gendry but confided in him her insecurities about her inability to be the &ldquo;proper lady&rdquo; he deserves. Gendry convinced her that he doesn&rsquo;t want a &ldquo;proper lady,&rdquo; and that he wasn&rsquo;t asking her to give up her independence and agency to marry him&ndash;he was asking her to let him love her for who she is, to rule as his equal and be the good leader she&rsquo;s always known in her heart she could be. They got married in a secret ceremony with only Davos as witness. Arya had to go back to Winterfell to help her family free Jon while Gendry stayed in SE to get acquainted with his lordship duties. While apart, they corresponded daily via raven and Arya admitted to Gendry that her restlessness and night terrors were getting worse to the point where she could barely function, so together, they decided that she should leave Westeros for a while so she could heal properly from her trauma without the added stress of leadership responsibilities. The council meeting happened and they went public with their marriage (the claw marks on Gendry&rsquo;s doublet <i>were not subtle</i>), they enjoyed a second honeymoon by banging all over SE while her ship was being built, then she set sail while Gendry stayed behind to rule over the Stormlands during the transition into King Bran&rsquo;s rule. Arya sailed for a year, discovered that West of Westeros is actually just East of Essos (they all had a good laugh about that), then she came back to SE tanned and ready to help Gendry lead their people (and learn how to use a fork). Arya and Gendry became the most beloved lord and lady in the history of the Stormlands, they had multiple children due to all the rabbit sex (their firstborn being a daughter who inherited SE because Arya put an end to male-only primogeniture), and they lived happily ever after.</p><p>What part of this is making people doubt gendrya is canon?

I may actually make this a 5 parter&hellip;anyway, here you go!\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>Arya had been quick with her goodbyes. She didn\u2019t want to\ndelay her travels any longer and she feared that, if given the time, she would\nremain in Westeros. As she was beginning to dock her ship, her brother had made\na rather impromptu appearance. She was surprised by his visit on the ship dock,\nbut took it with pleasure. </p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say enough goodbye?\u201d She asked as she approached his\nchair. </p><p>\u201cThere were things that I could not say whilst in the\ncouncil room, surrounded by prying ears.\u201d He told her, simply. </p><p>Arya pursed her lips together and studied her brother\u2019s\nface. Since their reunion, he had remained stoic and unreadable, but after the\nWar for the Dawn she began to see remnants of her old brother coming to the\nsurface. It was easier for her to see where his mind would wonder off too, or\neven the slight grin that he would produce every now and then reminded her that\nBran was still in there, somewhere. </p><p>\u201cPlease, leave us, Lord Tyrion.\u201d Bran had said to the imp.\nHe gave a swift nod and moved to stand just beyond the dock. </p><p>Arya crouched down so she was level with her brother. She\nwanted to be able to look him in the eye when they spoke; to be on his level. </p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Bran? I am already late leaving, I\u2019d much\nrather not delay my travels any longer.\u201d She chastised. </p><p>Bran remained unfazed by Arya\u2019s words. He still held his\ndemeanor and spoke with ease. \u201cYou will come across a set of choices, sister. I\nhope you choose wisely.\u201d </p><p>Arya raised her brows in confusion, \u201cWhat choices?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou will come to find out. Be safe on your travels and she\nwill be a beautiful babe.\u201d Bran gave one of his rare smiles and gestured for\nLord Tyrion to fetch him. </p><p>Arya\u2019s face had drained of all color. She knew her brother\ncould see things beyond what normal people could see, but she hadn\u2019t expected\nhim to know of her situation. She silently cursed his all-seeing eyes and rose\nto stand before him. </p><p>He gave a slight nod and Lord Tyrion and her brother began\nto descend the dock, making their way back to the keep. </p><p>Arya sighed and gave one last glance and the keep before\nher. Drogon\u2019s fire had destroyed most of what was there, but the builders had\nworked diligently within the last moon to make it suitable for the new king.\nAside from the council room, most of the bed chambers had been untouched and\nlivable. And although she would have been fine at some inn in town, she was grateful\nthat she was able to spend her last days in Westeros with her family. The keep\nhad also been filled with horrible memories from her past, memories that she\nwished to forget. </p><p>She hadn\u2019t said goodbye to him. She couldn\u2019t. But she did\ncheck on him before he left to ride to Storm\u2019s End. He was in the forge, just\nhours before he was supposed to ride. Arya had hidden in the shadows, not\nwanting to be seen. He was banging a hot piece of steel; bending it to his\nwill. He was angry, she could tell. Whenever he was angry, his brows would\nfurrow and his concentration unwavering. A wight could\u2019ve have walked in and he\nwould not have moved an inch. She wanted to study his features; to sear them\ninto her memory. She never wanted to forget what he looked like. His eyes, especially.\n</p><p>She stood there for nearly two hours studying him, until he\nwas summoned by Ser Davos to prepare for their journey. She had looked on in\nsadness as she saw his figure retreat from the forge. </p><p>Now the keep was nothing more than a speck of dust off in\nthe horizon. She could hardly see the castle on the hill and as they got\nfurther away, she couldn\u2019t help but feel that maybe she made the wrong choice. </p><p>She turned from the stern and walked over to her co-captain.\nHe was no more than twenty and eight, and had years of sailing experience under\nhis worn leather belt. He had been from Bravos and looked every bit of it. His\nskin was tan from years under the sun and his hair was a light shade of brown. </p><p>Arya had met the man soon after the sack of King\u2019s Landing.\nHe had been sailing around Westeros and had docked into the grand city for\nrestock of his ship. He hadn\u2019t meant to stay longer than a day, but his crew\nhad grew restless and wanted to indulge in the local whorehouses. Three days\nlater, his ship was burnt to a crisp and his crew all dead and gone. He had managed\nto escape the burning by jumping into the sea before the harbor had been\ndestroyed. </p><p>When Arya had been recruiting men and women for her journey\nat a local ale house, he had stumbled in, making aware of his skills at sea.\nShe had immediately hired the man and the rest was history. </p><p>\u201cThe winds seem good, Aries.\u201d She said to him.</p><p>He turned from the wheel and smiled. \u201cAye, let us hope that\nthey continue this way, Wolfie.\u201d </p><p>Arya smiled at the nickname he had given her. It was no surprise\nthat he knew of her and her family. Once she had killed the Night King, word\ntraveled fast and even sailors on the high seas were no strangers to talk. </p><p>\u201cHas your\u2026acquaintance made himself comfortable?\u201d She asked.\n</p><p>Aries blushed. He had been discreet with his relationship,\nbut even Arya Stark new that the man had smuggled a lover on board. </p><p>\u201cNothing gets by you, does it?\u201d He gave a weary smile. \u201cBut\nyes, he has made himself quite comfortable in my chambers. I hope you do not\nmind.\u201d </p><p>She placed a soft hand on his arm, \u201cIf he makes you happy on\nthis voyage, then no, I do not mind. But, if he does anything stupid, I cannot\nsay that I won\u2019t throw him overboard.\u201d </p><p>This made Aries laugh. Although they had only known each\nother for a short time, he couldn\u2019t help but love the feisty girl he called\nfriend. She was one of the few people who knew about his relations with other\nmen and she had accepted him whole heartedly. </p><p>He turned and gave a tight hug. He had owed everything to\nher, and he couldn\u2019t find any other way to show his gratitude. Arya was taken\nby surprise by the hug, but returned it swiftly. Aries had become a true friend\nto her. Ever since his first drunken appearance in the ale house, Arya knew\nthat he would be one to keep in her life. </p><p>Aries had noticed the slight bump rising from Arya\u2019s\nstomach. He pulled back in surprise and his eyes quickly darted to her abdomen.\nHis gaze flickered to hers and she gave a small nod, confirming what he was\nalready suspecting. </p><p>He knew better than to ask questions when it came to Arya\nStark. But his ever curios mind had got the better of him. </p><p>\u201cDid you know, before we embarked on our journey?\u201d </p><p>Arya sighed and gave a curt nod. </p><p>Aries eyes widen in shock. \u201cYou do understand the dangers\nof,\u201d He lowered his voice so only she could hear, \u201cgiving birth on a boat?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, I am aware. I have a maester and two chambermaids to\nhelp me when the time comes.\u201d She said swiftly. </p><p>\u201cAnd what of the babe, then? What will you do with it?\u201d He\nquestioned. </p><p>Arya groaned in frustration, \u201cI haven\u2019t thought that far\nahead. I am hoping by time the babe is born, we will reach some foreign land\nand I can hand it off to a woman who wants a child.\u201d </p><p>Aries shook his head, \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy must you ask such questions?\u201d Arya tried to avoid\nanswering, but Aries knew her games. </p><p>\u201cBecause no one else will. They are either too scared of you\nor too preoccupied to care. Do you remember what I told you when you asked me\nto be your second in command? I said that I will be the one to question your authority\nif I felt you were doing something wrong and I would not apologize for it. That\nis what I am doing now. So answer the question.\u201d His voice was hushed but\nstern. He needed to know what her plans were and perhaps he could steer her in\nthe right direction. </p><p>Arya\u2019s eyes grew dark. Aries had only seen her angry one\nother time in the nearly two moons that he knew her. The first time had been at\na drunken man harassing a bar maid. She asked the man to leave the girl alone,\ntwice, and when he still refused, she had stabbed him in the hand. </p><p>He was confident that Arya wouldn\u2019t hurt him, but the storm\nbrewing in her grey eyes made him think otherwise. </p><p>\u201cWhen the time come, Aries, I will know what to do. For now,\nkeep your questions to yourself.\u201d Arya\u2019s voice did not waver. She gave him one\nlast stern look, before she retreated under the ship\u2019s dock. </p>",

I may actually make this a 5 parter\u2026anyway, here you go!\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>Arya had been quick with her goodbyes. She didn\u2019t want to\ndelay her travels any longer and she feared that, if given the time, she would\nremain in Westeros. As she was beginning to dock her ship, her brother had made\na rather impromptu appearance. She was surprised by his visit on the ship dock,\nbut took it with pleasure. </p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say enough goodbye?\u201d She asked as she approached his\nchair. </p><p>\u201cThere were things that I could not say whilst in the\ncouncil room, surrounded by prying ears.\u201d He told her, simply. </p><p>Arya pursed her lips together and studied her brother\u2019s\nface. Since their reunion, he had remained stoic and unreadable, but after the\nWar for the Dawn she began to see remnants of her old brother coming to the\nsurface. It was easier for her to see where his mind would wonder off too, or\neven the slight grin that he would produce every now and then reminded her that\nBran was still in there, somewhere. </p><p>\u201cPlease, leave us, Lord Tyrion.\u201d Bran had said to the imp.\nHe gave a swift nod and moved to stand just beyond the dock. </p><p>Arya crouched down so she was level with her brother. She\nwanted to be able to look him in the eye when they spoke; to be on his level. </p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Bran? I am already late leaving, I\u2019d much\nrather not delay my travels any longer.\u201d She chastised. </p><p>Bran remained unfazed by Arya\u2019s words. He still held his\ndemeanor and spoke with ease. \u201cYou will come across a set of choices, sister. I\nhope you choose wisely.\u201d </p><p>Arya raised her brows in confusion, \u201cWhat choices?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou will come to find out. Be safe on your travels and she\nwill be a beautiful babe.\u201d Bran gave one of his rare smiles and gestured for\nLord Tyrion to fetch him. </p><p>Arya\u2019s face had drained of all color. She knew her brother\ncould see things beyond what normal people could see, but she hadn\u2019t expected\nhim to know of her situation. She silently cursed his all-seeing eyes and rose\nto stand before him. </p><p>He gave a slight nod and Lord Tyrion and her brother began\nto descend the dock, making their way back to the keep. </p><p>Arya sighed and gave one last glance and the keep before\nher. Drogon\u2019s fire had destroyed most of what was there, but the builders had\nworked diligently within the last moon to make it suitable for the new king.\nAside from the council room, most of the bed chambers had been untouched and\nlivable. And although she would have been fine at some inn in town, she was grateful\nthat she was able to spend her last days in Westeros with her family. The keep\nhad also been filled with horrible memories from her past, memories that she\nwished to forget. </p><p>She hadn\u2019t said goodbye to him. She couldn\u2019t. But she did\ncheck on him before he left to ride to Storm\u2019s End. He was in the forge, just\nhours before he was supposed to ride. Arya had hidden in the shadows, not\nwanting to be seen. He was banging a hot piece of steel; bending it to his\nwill. He was angry, she could tell. Whenever he was angry, his brows would\nfurrow and his concentration unwavering. A wight could\u2019ve have walked in and he\nwould not have moved an inch. She wanted to study his features; to sear them\ninto her memory. She never wanted to forget what he looked like. His eyes, especially.\n</p><p>She stood there for nearly two hours studying him, until he\nwas summoned by Ser Davos to prepare for their journey. She had looked on in\nsadness as she saw his figure retreat from the forge. </p><p>Now the keep was nothing more than a speck of dust off in\nthe horizon. She could hardly see the castle on the hill and as they got\nfurther away, she couldn\u2019t help but feel that maybe she made the wrong choice. </p><p>She turned from the stern and walked over to her co-captain.\nHe was no more than twenty and eight, and had years of sailing experience under\nhis worn leather belt. He had been from Bravos and looked every bit of it. His\nskin was tan from years under the sun and his hair was a light shade of brown. </p><p>Arya had met the man soon after the sack of King\u2019s Landing.\nHe had been sailing around Westeros and had docked into the grand city for\nrestock of his ship. He hadn\u2019t meant to stay longer than a day, but his crew\nhad grew restless and wanted to indulge in the local whorehouses. Three days\nlater, his ship was burnt to a crisp and his crew all dead and gone. He had managed\nto escape the burning by jumping into the sea before the harbor had been\ndestroyed. </p><p>When Arya had been recruiting men and women for her journey\nat a local ale house, he had stumbled in, making aware of his skills at sea.\nShe had immediately hired the man and the rest was history. </p><p>\u201cThe winds seem good, Aries.\u201d She said to him.</p><p>He turned from the wheel and smiled. \u201cAye, let us hope that\nthey continue this way, Wolfie.\u201d </p><p>Arya smiled at the nickname he had given her. It was no surprise\nthat he knew of her and her family. Once she had killed the Night King, word\ntraveled fast and even sailors on the high seas were no strangers to talk. </p><p>\u201cHas your\u2026acquaintance made himself comfortable?\u201d She asked.\n</p><p>Aries blushed. He had been discreet with his relationship,\nbut even Arya Stark new that the man had smuggled a lover on board. </p><p>\u201cNothing gets by you, does it?\u201d He gave a weary smile. \u201cBut\nyes, he has made himself quite comfortable in my chambers. I hope you do not\nmind.\u201d </p><p>She placed a soft hand on his arm, \u201cIf he makes you happy on\nthis voyage, then no, I do not mind. But, if he does anything stupid, I cannot\nsay that I won\u2019t throw him overboard.\u201d </p><p>This made Aries laugh. Although they had only known each\nother for a short time, he couldn\u2019t help but love the feisty girl he called\nfriend. She was one of the few people who knew about his relations with other\nmen and she had accepted him whole heartedly. </p><p>He turned and gave a tight hug. He had owed everything to\nher, and he couldn\u2019t find any other way to show his gratitude. Arya was taken\nby surprise by the hug, but returned it swiftly. Aries had become a true friend\nto her. Ever since his first drunken appearance in the ale house, Arya knew\nthat he would be one to keep in her life. </p><p>Aries had noticed the slight bump rising from Arya\u2019s\nstomach. He pulled back in surprise and his eyes quickly darted to her abdomen.\nHis gaze flickered to hers and she gave a small nod, confirming what he was\nalready suspecting. </p><p>He knew better than to ask questions when it came to Arya\nStark. But his ever curios mind had got the better of him. </p><p>\u201cDid you know, before we embarked on our journey?\u201d </p><p>Arya sighed and gave a curt nod. </p><p>Aries eyes widen in shock. \u201cYou do understand the dangers\nof,\u201d He lowered his voice so only she could hear, \u201cgiving birth on a boat?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, I am aware. I have a maester and two chambermaids to\nhelp me when the time comes.\u201d She said swiftly. </p><p>\u201cAnd what of the babe, then? What will you do with it?\u201d He\nquestioned. </p><p>Arya groaned in frustration, \u201cI haven\u2019t thought that far\nahead. I am hoping by time the babe is born, we will reach some foreign land\nand I can hand it off to a woman who wants a child.\u201d </p><p>Aries shook his head, \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy must you ask such questions?\u201d Arya tried to avoid\nanswering, but Aries knew her games. </p><p>\u201cBecause no one else will. They are either too scared of you\nor too preoccupied to care. Do you remember what I told you when you asked me\nto be your second in command? I said that I will be the one to question your authority\nif I felt you were doing something wrong and I would not apologize for it. That\nis what I am doing now. So answer the question.\u201d His voice was hushed but\nstern. He needed to know what her plans were and perhaps he could steer her in\nthe right direction. </p><p>Arya\u2019s eyes grew dark. Aries had only seen her angry one\nother time in the nearly two moons that he knew her. The first time had been at\na drunken man harassing a bar maid. She asked the man to leave the girl alone,\ntwice, and when he still refused, she had stabbed him in the hand. </p><p>He was confident that Arya wouldn\u2019t hurt him, but the storm\nbrewing in her grey eyes made him think otherwise. </p><p>\u201cWhen the time come, Aries, I will know what to do. For now,\nkeep your questions to yourself.\u201d Arya\u2019s voice did not waver. She gave him one\nlast stern look, before she retreated under the ship\u2019s dock. </p>",
