It was so well-written and made me feel things so I just had to write this. I reckon you should go and read that first. I really hope you like it and give me feedback! Please note that Y/N is a youtuber and a singer, too. I\u2019ve been picturing her to make some music like Marian Hill.<br/></b></p><p><b>Warning: A litte bit of angst I guess</b></p><hr><p>When Y/N finally arrived at her home, she took her coat and shoes off, throwing them carelessly at the floor and went to the couch, flopping herself on it and looked up to the ceiling. <br/></p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe it. She just couldn\u2019t believe that he would let her down like that, especially when she had planned everything out and he\u2019d agreed. He agreed to come, to make up for all of the time that he ditched her when he was writing something. And now he ditched her again. They lived in the bloody same town, and still, she had barely seen him for the last month. She was way too angry to cry.</p><p>Y/N was very busy herself,with her music and her youtube channel going, but she still made time for him. She had even postponed some important stuff for him, just so that she could support him and be there. Why wouldn\u2019t he do the same?</p><p>Still, the hotel and the flight were booked, so she would go. She was way too stubborn to not go, but she was sure that she wouldn\u2019t enjoy it even half as much. <br/></p><p>Y/N called her best friend, suprising her with the trip to Bora Bora, something that Barb had always been a little jealous of, so to say that she was excited to go, was an understatement. And luckily, she could take a few days off of work.<br/></p><p>\u201cBut I thought you and Harry were supposed to go\u201d, she wondered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated\u201d, Y/N sighed and filled her in. <br/></p><p>Barb was silent for a minute on the other side of the line.</p><p>\u201cLook, I really don\u2019t want to upset you, but&hellip;\u201d, Barb paused, \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s healthy, you know?\u201d</p><p>Y/N knew what she meant, yet she didn\u2019t actually want to here it.</p><p>\u201cI mean I\u2018ve seen you putting him first all the time, but Y/N, you know that you can\u2019t keep that up. Maybe you should talk to him\u201d, she continued.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that he wants to talk to me right now\u201d, Y/N sighed. \u201cAnd I definitely do not want to talk to him right now.\u201d</p><p>They continued to chat for a while, discussing what they could do on Bora Bora, before Barb had to hang up since she had to pack.</p><p>\u00a0Only then, when Y/N was alone and her anger at Harry had faded away, she started to feel tears well up in her eyes. She let them fall freely, finally allowing herself to think about what this would mean for her relationship.</p><p>He let her down. And he did not want to have her around. Not exactly what you\u2019d call a happy relationship. <br/></p><p>Y/N expected him to call her, but he didn\u2019t. There wasn\u2019t even a text. By the time it had started to get dark, her eyes were puffy from all the crying she had done, and her tummy ached from the amount of chocolate icecream that she had eaten. She missed him terribly, because even if she could just drive over to him, he was so far out of her reach that she couldn\u2019t take it. They were drifting apart, and Y/N wondered if they had been ignoring it for too long. Maybe this had damaged her relationship beyond repair.\u00a0</p><p>She contemplated driving over to his again, talking it out, but the thought of him pushing her away was too much for her. She couldn\u2019t handle that. Still, she worried about him. She knew how she became when she was writing music. She\u2019d forget everything around her, she wouldn\u2019t eat or drink all day, she wouldn\u2019t answer the phone. He was no different. <br/></p><p>She decided to call Mitch, since she thought that this was a good compromise. <br/></p><p>He answered after it rang for a few times. <br/></p><p>\u201cHey Y/N\u201d, he said cheerfully and Y/N could hear some drums in the background. He must be at the studio, which wasn\u2019t exactly uncommon since Harry often tended to go there after writing a bit to himself.<br/></p><p>\u201cHi Mitch\u201d, she said, her voice still raspy from all the crying that she had done. <br/></p><p>\u201cGet off the phone, we\u2019re working!\u201d, she could hear a way too familiar voice yell. <br/></p><p>Harry. She felt her heartbeat quicken at the sound of his voice. He sounded way too angry to be in the studio right now. <br/></p><p>\u201cCalm down mate, I\u2019ll be quick\u201d, she heard Mitch say before the sound of the drums became a bit more distant. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI&hellip; was wondering if you could check up on Harry? I mean maybe you could look after him for a bit, make him eat something from time to time\u201d, Y/N said silently. She clearly hadn\u2019t thought that through. <br/></p><p>\u201cBut&hellip; you\u2019re checking up on him already, aren\u2019t you?\u201d, Mitch wondered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m&hellip;\u201d, she took a deep breath, \u201cI\u2019m leaving to Bora Bora for a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201dOh, Bora Bora? That\u2019s nice\u201d, Mitch said.<br/></p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t told you-\u201d<br/></p><p>She stopped talking as she heard a little bit of commotion on the other side of the line. Harry hadn\u2019t even told them that he was going. He had never planned to go. <br/></p><p>\u201cMitch, can you come back in already? Harry is losing his shit right now\u201d, she heard Jeff say. \u201cWho\u2019re you on the phone with anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N.\u201d</p><p>It was silent for a long moment and Y/N thought about hanging up, but then she heard Jeff speak to her. <br/></p><p>\u201cHi Y/N, Harry seems awfully upset right now, I was thinking maybe you could talk to him? He\u2019s being a real pain in the ass right now and-\u201d Jeff couldn\u2019t continue since Y/N interrupted him.</p><p>\u201cIf he would want to talk to me then he would call me, wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d She knew she was being harsh and that Jeff didn\u2019t deserve it, especially since he had always been nice to her, but she couldn\u2019t help it. She was losing her shit, too.<br/></p><p>\u201cI figured he was just a bit too caught up in all the writing to actually know what he\u2019s doing. I thought you would understand-\u201d, Jeff tried again.</p><p>\u201cLook, Jeff. Of course I understand that writing an album is such a huge thing. I have written three myself. So, yes, I do understand. But I don\u2019t understand how one can be such a dick about it, that he\u2019s pushing everbody away who care about him\u201d, she had started to cry again, and her sobbing mixed with her anger was clearly alarming Jeff. <br/></p><p>\u201cY/N are you okay?\u201d, Jeff asked worriedly. \u201cI\u2019m putting you on speaker so Mitch can hear, too, okay?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOh yeah, I\u2019m perfectly fine\u201d, Y/N said, her voice full of sarcasm. She was sobbing so hard right now that she didn\u2019t hear Harry\u2019s voice on the other side. \u201cIt\u2019s not like my boyfriend forgot about a trip that we had planned for a month now or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, stop being such a twat about that\u201d, she heard Harry say. She was so startled by his voice that she couldn\u2019t reply anything. <br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being no help right now at all. I thought you knew how important that was. Could you at least try to support me?\u201d, he said angrily.</p><p>Fortunately, Y/N found her voice again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ditching me and now I\u2019m the twat? We both know that you can\u2019t write a damn thing when you\u2019re this stressed, so I thought I\u2019d get you to relax for a bit, but no, the grand Harry Styles isn\u2019t having any of it\u201d, she spat.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare call me that\u201d, he hissed. He started talking again, but Y/N had enough.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving for Bora Bora tomorrow, and we\u2019ll talk about it when I\u2019m back and you\u2019ve come to your senses again. Goodbye, Harry.\u201d</p><p>She heard him say something angrily, but Y/N ended the call.</p><p>They had never fought like this before. Of course, there had been some arguments, but it had never been this serious. <br/></p><p>She ended up in her bed, cuddled up in her favourite jumper of his, crying herself to sleep.</p><hr><p>Harry spent another four hours at the studio, but he didn\u2019t get any work done. What he managed though, was to get his entire band annoyed, until Jeff finally sent them home. <br/></p><p>When Harry turned to leave, too, he was stopped by Jeff.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you have done, mate, but Y/N sounded really upset. You better fix this, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe I don\u2019t want to fix something that isn\u2019t even my fault\u201d, he grumbled, impatient to finally go home.</p><p>\u201cWe both know that she wouldn\u2019t lash out without a reason though\u201d, Jeff said, still blocking his path.</p><p>\u201cWell, if she would\u2019ve been a supportive girlfriend for once, then none of us would have any reason to lash out\u201d, Harry sounded too cold for Jeff\u2019s liking.</p><p>\u201cY/N\u2019s the best thing that has ever happened to you, don\u2019t do something you\u2019ll regret.\u201d Jeff was really worried at that point, he had never heard Harry talk about Y/N like that. It was upsetting, to say the least. Still, he decided to call it a night, for Harry probably wouldn\u2019t change his mind without a good night\u2019s sleep.<br/></p><p>When he returned to his house, he finally noticed how hungry he was, so he went to the fridge. He was suprised to see his favourite vegetables and yoghurt, since he couldn\u2019t remember the last time when he actually did some grocery shopping. It must have been Y/N. He frowned. Now that he had thought about her, he remembered how she had brought him some dinner in his office, just before they fought. Harry walked over and looked at the untouched plate, standing right there where his love had left it. <br/></p><p>His previous anger was fading away rapidly as he realized what he had done. A lump formed in his throat, making him swallow hard. He warmed up the dinner she made for him, and ate in silence. She was absent in every way possible. Usually, he\u2019d find a cup of tea in the kitchen, long forgotten and cold since she was up to something else. Now, the counter was empty and she had done the dishes. He\u2019d find a pair of fuzzy socks on the couch because her feet would get all cold. As he looked over to the living room, it was neat and tidy, all the blankets were folded and there were no socks in sight. <br/></p><p>His bottom lip started to quiver, and soon tears were streaming out all over his face, loud sobs were echoing in his empty house and Y/N wasn\u2019t there to comfort him. And it was all his fault. Of course she was supportive, and what did he do? He made her leave, made her feel unwanted and now she was off to Bora Bora without him. He missed her so terribly much, he wanted to talk to her, hold her, tell her he was incredibly sorry for all the things he had said and done. But he knew that she wouldn\u2019t pick up. She had to take her time now, she always did when they fought. Since this was their biggest fight yet, he couldn\u2019t think of how much time she\u2019d need. <br/></p><p>He tried to go to bed, putting on a t-shirt she wore that often that it was basically hers, but he couldn\u2019t find peace. He knew this was bad. He just hoped she would let him fix it.<br/></p><p>So he got up in, went in his office and grabbed his guitar.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"488\" data-orig-height=\"370\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"stylesinthewild:LOn-DkE_VAFK70lpIK4nFQ:Z-899i2MqIJRa\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6dd1642cf06bce5b6d8b2fe605d53960/tumblr_oro5mfIRNZ1v6scw1o1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"488\" data-orig-height=\"370\"/></figure><p><b>Let me know how you liked it!<br/>You can find all of my writing <a href=\"http://kissykindness.tumblr.com/masterlist\" target=\"_blank\">here </a>or you can request something <a href=\"http://kissykindness.tumblr.com/ask\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</b><br/></p>",

He sounded way too angry to be in the studio right now. <br></p><p>\u201cCalm down mate, I\u2019ll be quick\u201d, she heard Mitch say before the sound of the drums became a bit more distant. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 was wondering if you could check up on Harry? I mean maybe you could look after him for a bit, make him eat something from time to time\u201d, Y/N said silently. She clearly hadn\u2019t thought that through. <br></p><p>\u201cBut\u2026 you\u2019re checking up on him already, aren\u2019t you?\u201d, Mitch wondered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026\u201d, she took a deep breath, \u201cI\u2019m leaving to Bora Bora for a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201dOh, Bora Bora? That\u2019s nice\u201d, Mitch said.<br></p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t told you-\u201d<br></p><p>She stopped talking as she heard a little bit of commotion on the other side of the line. Harry hadn\u2019t even told them that he was going. He had never planned to go. <br></p><p>\u201cMitch, can you come back in already? Harry is losing his shit right now\u201d, she heard Jeff say. \u201cWho\u2019re you on the phone with anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N.\u201d</p><p>It was silent for a long moment and Y/N thought about hanging up, but then she heard Jeff speak to her. <br></p><p>\u201cHi Y/N, Harry seems awfully upset right now, I was thinking maybe you could talk to him? He\u2019s being a real pain in the ass right now and-\u201d Jeff couldn\u2019t continue since Y/N interrupted him.</p><p>\u201cIf he would want to talk to me then he would call me, wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d She knew she was being harsh and that Jeff didn\u2019t deserve it, especially since he had always been nice to her, but she couldn\u2019t help it. She was losing her shit, too.<br></p><p>\u201cI figured he was just a bit too caught up in all the writing to actually know what he\u2019s doing. I thought you would understand-\u201d, Jeff tried again.</p><p>\u201cLook, Jeff. Of course I understand that writing an album is such a huge thing. I have written three myself. So, yes, I do understand. But I don\u2019t understand how one can be such a dick about it, that he\u2019s pushing everbody away who care about him\u201d, she had started to cry again, and her sobbing mixed with her anger was clearly alarming Jeff. <br></p><p>\u201cY/N are you okay?\u201d, Jeff asked worriedly. \u201cI\u2019m putting you on speaker so Mitch can hear, too, okay?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh yeah, I\u2019m perfectly fine\u201d, Y/N said, her voice full of sarcasm. She was sobbing so hard right now that she didn\u2019t hear Harry\u2019s voice on the other side. \u201cIt\u2019s not like my boyfriend forgot about a trip that we had planned for a month now or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, stop being such a twat about that\u201d, she heard Harry say. She was so startled by his voice that she couldn\u2019t reply anything. <br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being no help right now at all. I thought you knew how important that was. Could you at least try to support me?\u201d, he said angrily.</p><p>Fortunately, Y/N found her voice again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ditching me and now I\u2019m the twat? We both know that you can\u2019t write a damn thing when you\u2019re this stressed, so I thought I\u2019d get you to relax for a bit, but no, the grand Harry Styles isn\u2019t having any of it\u201d, she spat.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare call me that\u201d, he hissed. He started talking again, but Y/N had enough.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving for Bora Bora tomorrow, and we\u2019ll talk about it when I\u2019m back and you\u2019ve come to your senses again. Goodbye, Harry.\u201d</p><p>She heard him say something angrily, but Y/N ended the call.</p><p>They had never fought like this before. Of course, there had been some arguments, but it had never been this serious. <br></p><p>She ended up in her bed, cuddled up in her favourite jumper of his, crying herself to sleep.</p><hr><p>Harry spent another four hours at the studio, but he didn\u2019t get any work done. What he managed though, was to get his entire band annoyed, until Jeff finally sent them home. <br></p><p>When Harry turned to leave, too, he was stopped by Jeff.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you have done, mate, but Y/N sounded really upset. You better fix this, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe I don\u2019t want to fix something that isn\u2019t even my fault\u201d, he grumbled, impatient to finally go home.</p><p>\u201cWe both know that she wouldn\u2019t lash out without a reason though\u201d, Jeff said, still blocking his path.</p><p>\u201cWell, if she would\u2019ve been a supportive girlfriend for once, then none of us would have any reason to lash out\u201d, Harry sounded too cold for Jeff\u2019s liking.</p><p>\u201cY/N\u2019s the best thing that has ever happened to you, don\u2019t do something you\u2019ll regret.\u201d Jeff was really worried at that point, he had never heard Harry talk about Y/N like that. It was upsetting, to say the least. Still, he decided to call it a night, for Harry probably wouldn\u2019t change his mind without a good night\u2019s sleep.<br></p><p>When he returned to his house, he finally noticed how hungry he was, so he went to the fridge. He was suprised to see his favourite vegetables and yoghurt, since he couldn\u2019t remember the last time when he actually did some grocery shopping. It must have been Y/N. He frowned. Now that he had thought about her, he remembered how she had brought him some dinner in his office, just before they fought. Harry walked over and looked at the untouched plate, standing right there where his love had left it. <br></p><p>His previous anger was fading away rapidly as he realized what he had done. A lump formed in his throat, making him swallow hard. He warmed up the dinner she made for him, and ate in silence. She was absent in every way possible. Usually, he\u2019d find a cup of tea in the kitchen, long forgotten and cold since she was up to something else. Now, the counter was empty and she had done the dishes. He\u2019d find a pair of fuzzy socks on the couch because her feet would get all cold. As he looked over to the living room, it was neat and tidy, all the blankets were folded and there were no socks in sight. <br></p><p>His bottom lip started to quiver, and soon tears were streaming out all over his face, loud sobs were echoing in his empty house and Y/N wasn\u2019t there to comfort him. And it was all his fault. Of course she was supportive, and what did he do? He made her leave, made her feel unwanted and now she was off to Bora Bora without him. He missed her so terribly much, he wanted to talk to her, hold her, tell her he was incredibly sorry for all the things he had said and done. But he knew that she wouldn\u2019t pick up. She had to take her time now, she always did when they fought. Since this was their biggest fight yet, he couldn\u2019t think of how much time she\u2019d need. <br></p><p>He tried to go to bed, putting on a t-shirt she wore that often that it was basically hers, but he couldn\u2019t find peace. He knew this was bad. He just hoped she would let him fix it.<br></p><p>So he got up in, went in his office and grabbed his guitar.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"488\" data-orig-height=\"370\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"stylesinthewild:LOn-DkE_VAFK70lpIK4nFQ:Z-899i2MqIJRa\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6dd1642cf06bce5b6d8b2fe605d53960/tumblr_oro5mfIRNZ1v6scw1o1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"488\" data-orig-height=\"370\"></figure><p><b>Let me know how you liked it!<br>You can find all of my writing <a href=\"http://kissykindness.tumblr.com/masterlist\" target=\"_blank\">here </a>or you can request something <a href=\"http://kissykindness.tumblr.com/ask\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</b><br></p>",

The original post is called \u201cVacation\u201d and is written by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miFcZzGs_JjUsJ_11kyO0-g\" target=\"_blank\">@itslikeipayforit</a> and you can find it <a href=\"https://itslikeipayforit.tumblr.com/post/184137230330/vacation\" target=\"_blank\"><i>here</i></a>. It was so well-written and made me feel things so I just had to write this. I reckon you should go and read that first. I really hope you like it and give me feedback! Please note that Y/N is a youtuber and a singer, too. I\u2019ve been picturing her to make some music like Marian Hill.<br></b></p><p><b>Warning: A litte bit of angst I guess</b></p><hr><p>When Y/N finally arrived at her home, she took her coat and shoes off, throwing them carelessly at the floor and went to the couch, flopping herself on it and looked up to the ceiling. <br></p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe it. She just couldn\u2019t believe that he would let her down like that, especially when she had planned everything out and he\u2019d agreed. He agreed to come, to make up for all of the time that he ditched her when he was writing something. And now he ditched her again. They lived in the bloody same town, and still, she had barely seen him for the last month. She was way too angry to cry.</p><p>Y/N was very busy herself,with her music and her youtube channel going, but she still made time for him. She had even postponed some important stuff for him, just so that she could support him and be there. Why wouldn\u2019t he do the same?</p><p>Still, the hotel and the flight were booked, so she would go. She was way too stubborn to not go, but she was sure that she wouldn\u2019t enjoy it even half as much. <br></p><p>Y/N called her best friend, suprising her with the trip to Bora Bora, something that Barb had always been a little jealous of, so to say that she was excited to go, was an understatement. And luckily, she could take a few days off of work.<br></p><p>\u201cBut I thought you and Harry were supposed to go\u201d, she wondered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated\u201d, Y/N sighed and filled her in. <br></p><p>Barb was silent for a minute on the other side of the line.</p><p>\u201cLook, I really don\u2019t want to upset you, but\u2026\u201d, Barb paused, \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s healthy, you know?\u201d</p><p>Y/N knew what she meant, yet she didn\u2019t actually want to here it.</p><p>\u201cI mean I\u2018ve seen you putting him first all the time, but Y/N, you know that you can\u2019t keep that up. Maybe you should talk to him\u201d, she continued.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that he wants to talk to me right now\u201d, Y/N sighed. \u201cAnd I definitely do not want to talk to him right now.\u201d</p><p>They continued to chat for a while, discussing what they could do on Bora Bora, before Barb had to hang up since she had to pack.</p><p>\u00a0Only then, when Y/N was alone and her anger at Harry had faded away, she started to feel tears well up in her eyes. She let them fall freely, finally allowing herself to think about what this would mean for her relationship.</p><p>He let her down. And he did not want to have her around. Not exactly what you\u2019d call a happy relationship. <br></p><p>Y/N expected him to call her, but he didn\u2019t. There wasn\u2019t even a text. By the time it had started to get dark, her eyes were puffy from all the crying she had done, and her tummy ached from the amount of chocolate icecream that she had eaten. She missed him terribly, because even if she could just drive over to him, he was so far out of her reach that she couldn\u2019t take it. They were drifting apart, and Y/N wondered if they had been ignoring it for too long. Maybe this had damaged her relationship beyond repair.\u00a0</p><p>She contemplated driving over to his again, talking it out, but the thought of him pushing her away was too much for her. She couldn\u2019t handle that. Still, she worried about him. She knew how she became when she was writing music. She\u2019d forget everything around her, she wouldn\u2019t eat or drink all day, she wouldn\u2019t answer the phone. He was no different. <br></p><p>She decided to call Mitch, since she thought that this was a good compromise. <br></p><p>He answered after it rang for a few times. <br></p><p>\u201cHey Y/N\u201d, he said cheerfully and Y/N could hear some drums in the background. He must be at the studio, which wasn\u2019t exactly uncommon since Harry often tended to go there after writing a bit to himself.<br></p><p>\u201cHi Mitch\u201d, she said, her voice still raspy from all the crying that she had done. <br></p><p>\u201cGet off the phone, we\u2019re working!\u201d, she could hear a way too familiar voice yell. <br></p><p>Harry. She felt her heartbeat quicken at the sound of his voice. He sounded way too angry to be in the studio right now. <br></p><p>\u201cCalm down mate, I\u2019ll be quick\u201d, she heard Mitch say before the sound of the drums became a bit more distant. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 was wondering if you could check up on Harry?

That\u2019s nice\u201d, Mitch said.<br></p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t told you-\u201d<br></p><p>She stopped talking as she heard a little bit of commotion on the other side of the line. Harry hadn\u2019t even told them that he was going. He had never planned to go. <br></p><p>\u201cMitch, can you come back in already? Harry is losing his shit right now\u201d, she heard Jeff say. \u201cWho\u2019re you on the phone with anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N.\u201d</p><p>It was silent for a long moment and Y/N thought about hanging up, but then she heard Jeff speak to her. <br></p><p>\u201cHi Y/N, Harry seems awfully upset right now, I was thinking maybe you could talk to him?

                "content": "<p><b>So this is something a little bit special, since this is basically a sequel to something that I haven&rsquo;t written. The original post is called &ldquo;Vacation&rdquo; and is written by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miFcZzGs_JjUsJ_11kyO0-g\" target=\"_blank\">@itslikeipayforit</a> and you can find it <a href=\"https://itslikeipayforit.tumblr.com/post/184137230330/vacation\" target=\"_blank\"><i>here</i></a>. It was so well-written and made me feel things so I just had to write this. I reckon you should go and read that first. I really hope you like it and give me feedback! Please note that Y/N is a youtuber and a singer, too. I&rsquo;ve been picturing her to make some music like Marian Hill.<br /></b></p><p><b>Warning: A litte bit of angst I guess</b></p><hr /><p>When Y/N finally arrived at her home, she took her coat and shoes off, throwing them carelessly at the floor and went to the couch, flopping herself on it and looked up to the ceiling. <br /></p><p>She couldn&rsquo;t believe it. She just couldn&rsquo;t believe that he would let her down like that, especially when she had planned everything out and he&rsquo;d agreed. He agreed to come, to make up for all of the time that he ditched her when he was writing something. And now he ditched her again. They lived in the bloody same town, and still, she had barely seen him for the last month. She was way too angry to cry.</p><p>Y/N was very busy herself,with her music and her youtube channel going, but she still made time for him. She had even postponed some important stuff for him, just so that she could support him and be there. Why wouldn&rsquo;t he do the same?</p><p>Still, the hotel and the flight were booked, so she would go. She was way too stubborn to not go, but she was sure that she wouldn&rsquo;t enjoy it even half as much. <br /></p><p>Y/N called her best friend, suprising her with the trip to Bora Bora, something that Barb had always been a little jealous of, so to say that she was excited to go, was an understatement. And luckily, she could take a few days off of work.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;But I thought you and Harry were supposed to go&rdquo;, she wondered.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s complicated&rdquo;, Y/N sighed and filled her in. <br /></p><p>Barb was silent for a minute on the other side of the line.</p><p>&ldquo;Look, I really don&rsquo;t want to upset you, but&hellip;&rdquo;, Barb paused, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s healthy, you know?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N knew what she meant, yet she didn&rsquo;t actually want to here it.</p><p>&ldquo;I mean I&lsquo;ve seen you putting him first all the time, but Y/N, you know that you can&rsquo;t keep that up. Maybe you should talk to him&rdquo;, she continued.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that he wants to talk to me right now&rdquo;, Y/N sighed. &ldquo;And I definitely do not want to talk to him right now.&rdquo;</p><p>They continued to chat for a while, discussing what they could do on Bora Bora, before Barb had to hang up since she had to pack.</p><p>&nbsp;Only then, when Y/N was alone and her anger at Harry had faded away, she started to feel tears well up in her eyes. She let them fall freely, finally allowing herself to think about what this would mean for her relationship.</p><p>He let her down. And he did not want to have her around. Not exactly what you&rsquo;d call a happy relationship. <br /></p><p>Y/N expected him to call her, but he didn&rsquo;t. There wasn&rsquo;t even a text. By the time it had started to get dark, her eyes were puffy from all the crying she had done, and her tummy ached from the amount of chocolate icecream that she had eaten. She missed him terribly, because even if she could just drive over to him, he was so far out of her reach that she couldn&rsquo;t take it. They were drifting apart, and Y/N wondered if they had been ignoring it for too long. Maybe this had damaged her relationship beyond repair.&nbsp;</p><p>She contemplated driving over to his again, talking it out, but the thought of him pushing her away was too much for her. She couldn&rsquo;t handle that. Still, she worried about him. She knew how she became when she was writing music. She&rsquo;d forget everything around her, she wouldn&rsquo;t eat or drink all day, she wouldn&rsquo;t answer the phone. He was no different. <br /></p><p>She decided to call Mitch, since she thought that this was a good compromise. <br /></p><p>He answered after it rang for a few times. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey Y/N&rdquo;, he said cheerfully and Y/N could hear some drums in the background. He must be at the studio, which wasn&rsquo;t exactly uncommon since Harry often tended to go there after writing a bit to himself.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hi Mitch&rdquo;, she said, her voice still raspy from all the crying that she had done. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Get off the phone, we&rsquo;re working!&rdquo;, she could hear a way too familiar voice yell. <br /></p><p>Harry. She felt her heartbeat quicken at the sound of his voice. He sounded way too angry to be in the studio right now. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Calm down mate, I&rsquo;ll be quick&rdquo;, she heard Mitch say before the sound of the drums became a bit more distant. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip; was wondering if you could check up on Harry? I mean maybe you could look after him for a bit, make him eat something from time to time&rdquo;, Y/N said silently. She clearly hadn&rsquo;t thought that through. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;But&hellip; you&rsquo;re checking up on him already, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;, Mitch wondered.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip;&rdquo;, she took a deep breath, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving to Bora Bora for a few days.&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;Oh, Bora Bora? That&rsquo;s nice&rdquo;, Mitch said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t told you-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>She stopped talking as she heard a little bit of commotion on the other side of the line. Harry hadn&rsquo;t even told them that he was going. He had never planned to go. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Mitch, can you come back in already? Harry is losing his shit right now&rdquo;, she heard Jeff say. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;re you on the phone with anyway?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>It was silent for a long moment and Y/N thought about hanging up, but then she heard Jeff speak to her. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hi Y/N, Harry seems awfully upset right now, I was thinking maybe you could talk to him? He&rsquo;s being a real pain in the ass right now and-&rdquo; Jeff couldn&rsquo;t continue since Y/N interrupted him.</p><p>&ldquo;If he would want to talk to me then he would call me, wouldn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; She knew she was being harsh and that Jeff didn&rsquo;t deserve it, especially since he had always been nice to her, but she couldn&rsquo;t help it. She was losing her shit, too.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I figured he was just a bit too caught up in all the writing to actually know what he&rsquo;s doing. I thought you would understand-&rdquo;, Jeff tried again.</p><p>&ldquo;Look, Jeff. Of course I understand that writing an album is such a huge thing. I have written three myself. So, yes, I do understand. But I don&rsquo;t understand how one can be such a dick about it, that he&rsquo;s pushing everbody away who care about him&rdquo;, she had started to cry again, and her sobbing mixed with her anger was clearly alarming Jeff. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Y/N are you okay?&rdquo;, Jeff asked worriedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m putting you on speaker so Mitch can hear, too, okay?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah, I&rsquo;m perfectly fine&rdquo;, Y/N said, her voice full of sarcasm. She was sobbing so hard right now that she didn&rsquo;t hear Harry&rsquo;s voice on the other side. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like my boyfriend forgot about a trip that we had planned for a month now or anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, stop being such a twat about that&rdquo;, she heard Harry say. She was so startled by his voice that she couldn&rsquo;t reply anything. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re being no help right now at all. I thought you knew how important that was. Could you at least try to support me?&rdquo;, he said angrily.</p><p>Fortunately, Y/N found her voice again.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re ditching me and now I&rsquo;m the twat? We both know that you can&rsquo;t write a damn thing when you&rsquo;re this stressed, so I thought I&rsquo;d get you to relax for a bit, but no, the grand Harry Styles isn&rsquo;t having any of it&rdquo;, she spat.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare call me that&rdquo;, he hissed. He started talking again, but Y/N had enough.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving for Bora Bora tomorrow, and we&rsquo;ll talk about it when I&rsquo;m back and you&rsquo;ve come to your senses again. Goodbye, Harry.&rdquo;</p><p>She heard him say something angrily, but Y/N ended the call.</p><p>They had never fought like this before. Of course, there had been some arguments, but it had never been this serious. <br /></p><p>She ended up in her bed, cuddled up in her favourite jumper of his, crying herself to sleep.</p><hr /><p>Harry spent another four hours at the studio, but he didn&rsquo;t get any work done. What he managed though, was to get his entire band annoyed, until Jeff finally sent them home. <br /></p><p>When Harry turned to leave, too, he was stopped by Jeff.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you have done, mate, but Y/N sounded really upset. You better fix this, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, maybe I don&rsquo;t want to fix something that isn&rsquo;t even my fault&rdquo;, he grumbled, impatient to finally go home.</p><p>&ldquo;We both know that she wouldn&rsquo;t lash out without a reason though&rdquo;, Jeff said, still blocking his path.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, if she would&rsquo;ve been a supportive girlfriend for once, then none of us would have any reason to lash out&rdquo;, Harry sounded too cold for Jeff&rsquo;s liking.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N&rsquo;s the best thing that has ever happened to you, don&rsquo;t do something you&rsquo;ll regret.&rdquo; Jeff was really worried at that point, he had never heard Harry talk about Y/N like that. It was upsetting, to say the least. Still, he decided to call it a night, for Harry probably wouldn&rsquo;t change his mind without a good night&rsquo;s sleep.<br /></p><p>When he returned to his house, he finally noticed how hungry he was, so he went to the fridge. He was suprised to see his favourite vegetables and yoghurt, since he couldn&rsquo;t remember the last time when he actually did some grocery shopping. It must have been Y/N. He frowned. Now that he had thought about her, he remembered how she had brought him some dinner in his office, just before they fought. Harry walked over and looked at the untouched plate, standing right there where his love had left it. <br /></p><p>His previous anger was fading away rapidly as he realized what he had done. A lump formed in his throat, making him swallow hard. He warmed up the dinner she made for him, and ate in silence. She was absent in every way possible. Usually, he&rsquo;d find a cup of tea in the kitchen, long forgotten and cold since she was up to something else. Now, the counter was empty and she had done the dishes. He&rsquo;d find a pair of fuzzy socks on the couch because her feet would get all cold. As he looked over to the living room, it was neat and tidy, all the blankets were folded and there were no socks in sight. <br /></p><p>His bottom lip started to quiver, and soon tears were streaming out all over his face, loud sobs were echoing in his empty house and Y/N wasn&rsquo;t there to comfort him. And it was all his fault. Of course she was supportive, and what did he do? He made her leave, made her feel unwanted and now she was off to Bora Bora without him. He missed her so terribly much, he wanted to talk to her, hold her, tell her he was incredibly sorry for all the things he had said and done. But he knew that she wouldn&rsquo;t pick up. She had to take her time now, she always did when they fought. Since this was their biggest fight yet, he couldn&rsquo;t think of how much time she&rsquo;d need. <br /></p><p>He tried to go to bed, putting on a t-shirt she wore that often that it was basically hers, but he couldn&rsquo;t find peace. He knew this was bad. He just hoped she would let him fix it.<br /></p><p>So he got up in, went in his office and grabbed his guitar.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><b>Let me know how you liked it!<br />You can find all of my writing <a href=\"http://kissykindness.tumblr.com/masterlist\" target=\"_blank\">here </a>or you can request something <a href=\"http://kissykindness.tumblr.com/ask\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</b><br /></p>",

This is short but I\u2019m kinda proud of it! </b></i></p><p>You\u2019ve always considered yourself a polite person. It\u2019s natural for you, you\u2019ve worked in customer service jobs before now and your parents have always brought you up to be polite and courteous.</p><p>Harry - as most of the world knows - is also the same. One of the kindest souls you could ever come into contact with, in fact.</p><p>Being the way you are, and Harry being the way he is, it often leads you both to situations such as this one you\u2019re in right now. It isn\u2019t by any means a horrible situation; another day where Harry has wanted to show his face in public after hiding for a few days, take you for breakfast in the city and a walk in the park. Its one of your favourite kinds of days. What\u2019s happening now is just inevitable.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t help that even after eighteen months together you still have a confidence in yourself that is practically nonexistent. You still wonder every single day what the bloody hell Harry actually sees in you, because you can\u2019t help but think you\u2019re just a bit plain; simple in your looks.</p><p>And it\u2019s not the fact that he\u2019s got his arm around a polite fan, with that stupid and dorky smile on his face that makes your insides scream with joy, that has you feeling jealous. No, it\u2019s the fact that said fan is absolutely stunning; much more Harry\u2019s usual type and still with manners which he\u2019ll no doubt worship her for after this is over. She hasn\u2019t even been rude to you which is another brownie point. </p><p>You don\u2019t dislike her in any way at all as you take their picture with a genuine smile yourself - because there is literally nothing to dislike about her.

Don\u2019t know how many times I have to tell you that I love you and nobody else, but I\u2019ll keep saying it until you stop feeling bad about yourself, even if it\u2019s for everyday until we\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>You stare at him for a moment, blinking every couple of seconds until your gaze eventually falls to the floor. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m not having that.\u201d Harry chuckles, pulling you into him with an arm wrapped tightly around your waist as he pinches your chin to look back up to him. \u201cStop apologising for your feelings.\u201d</p><p>You breathe a laugh and struggle to contain your smile. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes and laughs again. \u201cStop it!\u201d </p><p>You groan and roll your head forward to rest against his chest. He feathers little kisses into your hair as his hand reaches for yours again.</p><p>\u201cCome on, I\u2019m bloody starving.\u201d He encourages, pressing a light kiss to your lips as you look up. He moves to stand beside you so you can continue walking again, his hand gripping yours tighter than usual. \u201cAll the pain au chocolats will be gone if we\u2019re not careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d You stress dramatically, \u201cGod forbid!\u201d</p><p>~~~</p><p>Now I want a pain au chocolat\u2026</p><p>Tag list: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRQvNGuL791trMASjjacTyQ\">@pxrrishly</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgPyqI5CkEId8g7xFggm2Hg\">@permanentllyharry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb5MZxMvKL3E9V-fzr16asg\">@talesofstyles</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUftrmoCR-gJ36qDkBozOAg\">@abundantlyabundant</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mC46KFufQzMQFQPY1dCvfcA\">@joan-of-disappointment</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m73AsCPI6pl5ydzYNqZA7ig\">@staceystoleyourheart</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYYD0_lJbE8J3m-qWYoZ2Ww\">@hoeforhaz</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlRbiKuRhgrY3E3H8bL5cIg\">@harry12styles94</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNcSwE3yuAMUrJFCByV9VEA\">@belikebebe</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw8YPeV1kp6lQtCreciPNCQ\">@harryismydaddy21</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGFOmVWpQgDRviVbQYGjJ8w\">@meet-me-in-the-harry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5sffYoPzjk56Rs6ZvKn9FQ\">@joycelovedorial</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp_6aoPyziVdi6ZXi6B8LjQ\">@evaolin</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmcxuUK9ZWplnHQCdhUVD1A\">@harrystyles-concepts</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfxkucLlCoWB5Gmly8d8H6Q\">@harryisalittleshit</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6jWlNWmGyQNYnEd6-SS92A\">@newtosaur250</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/myJAa8KxYrK4vh_yQTZ_60g\">@sydneys-life-blog</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZRip2ZNdgboKd6U6cXPvGA\">@flowerrrrrchilddd</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgrGBah2yj4TnFyzYRijzTQ\">@belle-ofthe-sea</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbryUSDk8hHw5rIDbYFA7aQ\">@grace-leigh</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD79q662XJ4yMKN7-cXEIJQ\">@winchesterwife27</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgQ5EdNPkpDmT4rcK7Heukg\">@lovableah</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUL6OHs_gc4Qkoa2S5W3_0g\">@particularnarry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnkGxxRkCVT61iklFLAskaw\">@secret-lil-rendez-vous</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmeYqReZqws9Lc4nBNu0ERw\">@stylesangelsx</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mK1QD13efdUXMi2H0exoJqQ\">@thefireisgone</a> </p>",
                "content": "<p><i><b>Sorry I&rsquo;m so rubbish with my time keeping at the moment! This is short but I&rsquo;m kinda proud of it! </b></i></p><p>You&rsquo;ve always considered yourself a polite person. It&rsquo;s natural for you, you&rsquo;ve worked in customer service jobs before now and your parents have always brought you up to be polite and courteous.</p><p>Harry - as most of the world knows - is also the same. One of the kindest souls you could ever come into contact with, in fact.</p><p>Being the way you are, and Harry being the way he is, it often leads you both to situations such as this one you&rsquo;re in right now. It isn&rsquo;t by any means a horrible situation; another day where Harry has wanted to show his face in public after hiding for a few days, take you for breakfast in the city and a walk in the park. Its one of your favourite kinds of days. What&rsquo;s happening now is just inevitable.</p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t help that even after eighteen months together you still have a confidence in yourself that is practically nonexistent. You still wonder every single day what the bloody hell Harry actually sees in you, because you can&rsquo;t help but think you&rsquo;re just a bit plain; simple in your looks.</p><p>And it&rsquo;s not the fact that he&rsquo;s got his arm around a polite fan, with that stupid and dorky smile on his face that makes your insides scream with joy, that has you feeling jealous. No, it&rsquo;s the fact that said fan is absolutely stunning; much more Harry&rsquo;s usual type and still with manners which he&rsquo;ll no doubt worship her for after this is over. She hasn&rsquo;t even been rude to you which is another brownie point. </p><p>You don&rsquo;t dislike her in any way at all as you take their picture with a genuine smile yourself - because there is literally nothing to dislike about her. But it still doesn&rsquo;t keep the ugly green monster that lives in the pit of your belly from stirring.</p><p>You&rsquo;re still thinking about it even after the fan has left - she&rsquo;d said multiple times she was making herself late for work but that it was absolutely fucking worth it. You couldn&rsquo;t help but agree with her vocally on that, which had also made her laugh. Again, a musical laugh that had your jealousy bubbling.</p><p>&ldquo;You alright, love?&rdquo; Harry hums as he squeezes your hand, probably noticing that you&rsquo;ve glanced over your shoulder five times since you&rsquo;d began walking again.</p><p>The girl had stood still for another moment just beaming at her phone, and yet she still looked completely breathtaking whilst doing something you&rsquo;d have been highly embarrassed for if someone else had seen you doing it.</p><p>&ldquo;She was pretty, wasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; You mumble, the sound much softer than you would usually speak as you peer up at him.</p><p>He&rsquo;s frowning down at you, brow showing a little crease that screams concern and confusion. &ldquo;Who, the fan?&rdquo;</p><p>You nod your answer, and he notices that dull life in your eyes that he only ever sees when you&rsquo;re feeling lesser of yourself. He hates it when you&rsquo;re like this - hates the way you constantly make yourself feel terrible about the way you look or the way you act. </p><p>It&rsquo;s irrelevant to him that that fan might be considered beautiful to some, because you&rsquo;re the most beautiful to him. For Harry; you&rsquo;re all that matters.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that to yourself, pet.&rdquo; Harry pleads with you, stopping your walking to turn and face you. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put yourself down like that, please.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Harry. I just can&rsquo;t help but feel a bit&hellip; jealous. And I hate that I feel that way but like, she looked so good in that bloody photo with you and I just never feel that way.&rdquo; Your tone is flat, though it holds a whine to it that you detest from the moment you&rsquo;d started speaking. You&rsquo;re being petty now - you&rsquo;re just a nightmare.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Harry says with a firmness that&rsquo;s not entirely unfamiliar, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you give yourself enough credit&hellip; ever. You&rsquo;re beautiful in every way. Inside and out. I, for one, love that it&rsquo;s you in pictures beside me and not anyone else. Me saying you don&rsquo;t need to be jealous is an obvious thing but I know it&rsquo;s not particularly easy for you.
