            "description": "In addition to the pain and the exhaustion, he recalled how waiting on the cross between takes became tedious. To fight the boredom, he listened to music on headphones. One particular song called \"Above All\" (Like a Rose ...) by Michael W. Smith helped him through his most difficult moments.\n\n\"It arrived when I was confused and angry. I didn't think I could go on. The song described how Jesus was rejected and alone. That thought took me to a place \u2014 it opened an interior door that held me while on the cross,\" an emotional Caviezel explained. \"The experience of feeling rejected and alone as all those around me laughed while drinking their hot coffees, oblivious to what was occurring. Jesus must have felt like this \u2014 forsaken, rejected, alone, and despised. It helped me pray in a very deep way \u2014 to pray without words, to pray from the heart. The discomfort, the loneliness, the split shoulder, the raw flesh all forced me into the arms of God because I had nowhere else to go for a performance I knew I was unable to create.\"\nJim Caviezel, Shamelessly Catholic",

You were reading a book, but you could barely keep your attention on it. John had left hours ago on a job that he was called in for, which would be okay if your boyfriend\u2019s job wasn\u2019t so dangerous.</p><p>John was a hitman. The <i>best </i>hitman actually. He was known to everyone in his business as the Baba Yaga, the boogeyman.</p><p>You didn\u2019t know all of this until you had been dating for about six months. He came clean with you because he thought you deserved that. He could tell that you two were getting serious and he wanted to lay it all out for you before you continued on. He expected you to leave him, but was surprised when you didn\u2019t. You were freaked out of course. How could this man with a gentle heart be in a profession that\u2019s so violent? You had fallen hard for John, however, so you didn\u2019t let his job occupation deter you. He\u2019d promised you that he was going to get out soon because he was ready to lead a normal life with you.</p><p>A year eventually went by and John asked you to move in with him, which you did. Everything was great. You and John were so domestic, but John still wasn\u2019t out of the game fully. He told you he was trying to get out, but he had a few more business deals to take care of. You didn\u2019t ask much about it. It was an unspoken rule that you didn\u2019t ask questions and he wouldn\u2019t tell you about it.</p><p>You finally put the book down and rubbed your eyes after reading the same sentence several times. You couldn\u2019t concentrate when John was out there doing who knew what. You didn\u2019t know if he was safe or anything. You just had to wait.</p><p>Finally, you heard the front door open. John\u2019s dog, who yet had a name, raised up from his spot and immediately went running to the door. You stood and followed him, gasping at what you found. John was stood there in his well tailored suit, but he was looking worse for wear. Blood stained the white dress shirt he was wearing along with various spots of his suit jacket. His face also had some blood on it and you could see some spots already swelling. His hair was disheveled and he was bent over the staircase. You\u2019d never seen him so beat up before.</p><p>\u201cJohn,\u201d you spoke in a soft tone as his dog went and greeted him. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>He looked your way and winced. \u201cY/N, you should be in bed, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep with you gone,\u201d you replied as you walked towards him and looked him over. \u201cAre you hurt anywhere else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust some sore ribs,\u201d he said and waved it off. \u201cNothing I haven\u2019t dealt with before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn, I think we should go to the hospital-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no hospitals,\u201d he said quickly and shook his head. \u201cYou know that. I\u2019ll be fine. I just have to clean myself up.\u201d</p><p>You sighed, but didn\u2019t argue with him. You knew it would be a lost cause. You went over to him and made him put his arm around your shoulders as you gently put your arm around him. \u201cFine, but you\u2019re going to let me take care of you at least.\u201d</p><p>You started helping him up the stairs with his dog right behind you both. It took some time, but you managed to help him up the stairs and to the bedroom you shared. His dog ran for the bed and hopped right up on it, making himself comfortable as you lead John to the bathroom. He leaned back against the counter as you grabbed all the supplies you would need.</p><p>\u201cI can do this myself, sweetheart,\u201d he said, but you shushed him.</p><p>\u201cShut up and let me take care of you,\u201d you replied with a bit of sass.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said and chuckled.</p><p>You began cleaning him up and applying antiseptic where it was needed. He barely flinched as you did all of this. His pain tolerance was pretty high, which made you feel bad. How many times had John been hurt to be so used to pain?</p><p>When you finished with his face, you worked on his knuckles. They were skinned up and bruising as well. You were as gentle as you could be with him. He took off his shirt and you hissed at the way his ribs on his right side were already starting to bruise.</p><p>\u201cIt looks worse than it feels,\u201d he said, noticing the look on your face as you stared at the bruising. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t make it any better, John,\u201d you told him. You could see from his reflection in the mirror that his back was also bruised up. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll just have to wrap them up and ice them. You could use a shower first though. Think you can handle it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you join me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d you started to tell him. \u201cYou\u2019re-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, <i>please,</i>\u201d he whispered as he laid a hand on your cheek, making you look up at him. \u201cI just really need you close to me right now.\u201d</p><p>You thought about it for a moment before you sighed. \u201cAlright, but no funny business, mister. You\u2019re banged up, which means I\u2019m not banging you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cruel,\u201d he groaned out. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll take what I can get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood&hellip;now I\u2019ll help you out of the rest of your clothes then I\u2019ll clean this mess up. I\u2019ll join you when I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>You helped him out of the rest of his clothes carefully before he walked over to the shower and turned the water on. You started cleaning up the mess you\u2019d made from helping him and putting everything back where it went. By the time you\u2019d finished, John was already in the shower and letting the warm water soothe his aching muscles. His back was facing you as steam was coming from the water and encircling him. You couldn\u2019t help but admire him even if he was banged up. He was still absolutely beautiful and looked like he deserved to be on display in an art museum. His back muscles were proudly on display as he washed his hair, showcasing his tattoos clearly.</p><p>\u201cAre you just going to stand there and enjoy the show or are you going to join me, Y/N?\u201d He asked, breaking you from your thoughts as he looked back at you with a little smirk.</p><p>You blushed just a bit from being caught before you started removing your own clothes, which was one of John\u2019s shirts and a pair of sleep shorts. Once you were completely naked, you stepped into the shower behind him. He turned to face you and pulled you to him so that you were under the spray with him. Water fell on you both as John leaned down and kissed you. You kissed him back as one of his hands came up to cup your cheek. It lasted for a few long moments before you finally pulled away.</p><p>\u201cJohn, I told you no funny business,\u201d you playfully scolded him with a look. \u201cThis is supposed to be a shower only.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t help myself, sweetheart,\u201d he replied as he looked down at you. His dark eyes seemed to be captivating you.</p><p>You hummed before you kissed his lips again. When you pulled away, you smiled at him before you looked down. His bruised ribs caught your eye and made you frown. You gently and very carefully ran your fingers over the injured area.</p><p>\u201cI hate seeing you hurt, John,\u201d you spoke softly over the sound of the water. \u201cThis is the worst it\u2019s been, but this isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve came in hurt. I know you can take care of yourself. I just worry about you so much.\u201d</p><p>John placed his finger under your chin and lifted your head so that you were looking at him again. He placed a sweet kiss on your forehead. \u201cThis was my last job. I\u2019m out for good this time.\u201d</p><p>Your eyes widened a bit in surprise as he spoke those words. He was out? For real this time?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re out?\u201d You asked just to be clear and he nodded. \u201cNo more jobs whatsoever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more jobs,\u201d he said and smiled a little. \u201cI did what I had to do in order to leave. My debts and favors are paid. I\u2019m all yours now, sweetheart. I\u2019m officially retired.\u201d</p><p>You smiled real big and almost jumped into his arms, but you remembered his injuries. Instead you gave him a kiss full of love and passion, radiating your excitement for his news through it. He kissed you back with just as much love. He seemed excited to finally be out too.</p><p>\u201cI love you, John,\u201d you whispered when you finally pulled apart.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Y/N,\u201d he replied as he rested his forehead against yours.</p><p>You finished up in the shower, washing John with care and sharing kisses in between. You\u2019d have to show him just how happy you were when he was healed up more.</p>",

He placed a sweet kiss on your forehead. \u201cThis was my last job. I\u2019m out for good this time.\u201d</p><p>Your eyes widened a bit in surprise as he spoke those words. He was out? For real this time?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re out?\u201d You asked just to be clear and he nodded. \u201cNo more jobs whatsoever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more jobs,\u201d he said and smiled a little. \u201cI did what I had to do in order to leave. My debts and favors are paid. I\u2019m all yours now, sweetheart. I\u2019m officially retired.\u201d</p><p>You smiled real big and almost jumped into his arms, but you remembered his injuries. Instead you gave him a kiss full of love and passion, radiating your excitement for his news through it. He kissed you back with just as much love. He seemed excited to finally be out too.</p><p>\u201cI love you, John,\u201d you whispered when you finally pulled apart.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Y/N,\u201d he replied as he rested his forehead against yours.</p><p>You finished up in the shower, washing John with care and sharing kisses in between. You\u2019d have to show him just how happy you were when he was healed up more.</p></p>",

You were reading a book, but you could barely keep your attention on it. John had left hours ago on a job that he was called in for, which would be okay if your boyfriend\u2019s job wasn\u2019t so dangerous.</p><p>John was a hitman. The <i>best </i>hitman actually. He was known to everyone in his business as the Baba Yaga, the boogeyman.</p><p>You didn\u2019t know all of this until you had been dating for about six months. He came clean with you because he thought you deserved that. He could tell that you two were getting serious and he wanted to lay it all out for you before you continued on. He expected you to leave him, but was surprised when you didn\u2019t. You were freaked out of course. How could this man with a gentle heart be in a profession that\u2019s so violent? You had fallen hard for John, however, so you didn\u2019t let his job occupation deter you. He\u2019d promised you that he was going to get out soon because he was ready to lead a normal life with you.</p><p>A year eventually went by and John asked you to move in with him, which you did. Everything was great. You and John were so domestic, but John still wasn\u2019t out of the game fully. He told you he was trying to get out, but he had a few more business deals to take care of. You didn\u2019t ask much about it. It was an unspoken rule that you didn\u2019t ask questions and he wouldn\u2019t tell you about it.</p><p>You finally put the book down and rubbed your eyes after reading the same sentence several times. You couldn\u2019t concentrate when John was out there doing who knew what. You didn\u2019t know if he was safe or anything. You just had to wait.</p><p>Finally, you heard the front door open. John\u2019s dog, who yet had a name, raised up from his spot and immediately went running to the door. You stood and followed him, gasping at what you found. John was stood there in his well tailored suit, but he was looking worse for wear. Blood stained the white dress shirt he was wearing along with various spots of his suit jacket. His face also had some blood on it and you could see some spots already swelling. His hair was disheveled and he was bent over the staircase. You\u2019d never seen him so beat up before.</p><p>\u201cJohn,\u201d you spoke in a soft tone as his dog went and greeted him. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>He looked your way and winced. \u201cY/N, you should be in bed, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep with you gone,\u201d you replied as you walked towards him and looked him over. \u201cAre you hurt anywhere else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust some sore ribs,\u201d he said and waved it off. \u201cNothing I haven\u2019t dealt with before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn, I think we should go to the hospital-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no hospitals,\u201d he said quickly and shook his head. \u201cYou know that. I\u2019ll be fine. I just have to clean myself up.\u201d</p><p>You sighed, but didn\u2019t argue with him. You knew it would be a lost cause. You went over to him and made him put his arm around your shoulders as you gently put your arm around him. \u201cFine, but you\u2019re going to let me take care of you at least.\u201d</p><p>You started helping him up the stairs with his dog right behind you both. It took some time, but you managed to help him up the stairs and to the bedroom you shared. His dog ran for the bed and hopped right up on it, making himself comfortable as you lead John to the bathroom. He leaned back against the counter as you grabbed all the supplies you would need.</p><p>\u201cI can do this myself, sweetheart,\u201d he said, but you shushed him.</p><p>\u201cShut up and let me take care of you,\u201d you replied with a bit of sass.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said and chuckled.</p><p>You began cleaning him up and applying antiseptic where it was needed. He barely flinched as you did all of this. His pain tolerance was pretty high, which made you feel bad. How many times had John been hurt to be so used to pain?</p><p>When you finished with his face, you worked on his knuckles. They were skinned up and bruising as well. You were as gentle as you could be with him. He took off his shirt and you hissed at the way his ribs on his right side were already starting to bruise.</p><p>\u201cIt looks worse than it feels,\u201d he said, noticing the look on your face as you stared at the bruising. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t make it any better, John,\u201d you told him. You could see from his reflection in the mirror that his back was also bruised up. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll just have to wrap them up and ice them. You could use a shower first though. Think you can handle it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you join me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d you started to tell him. \u201cYou\u2019re-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, <i>please,</i>\u201d he whispered as he laid a hand on your cheek, making you look up at him. \u201cI just really need you close to me right now.\u201d</p><p>You thought about it for a moment before you sighed. \u201cAlright, but no funny business, mister. You\u2019re banged up, which means I\u2019m not banging you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cruel,\u201d he groaned out. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll take what I can get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood\u2026now I\u2019ll help you out of the rest of your clothes then I\u2019ll clean this mess up. I\u2019ll join you when I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>You helped him out of the rest of his clothes carefully before he walked over to the shower and turned the water on. You started cleaning up the mess you\u2019d made from helping him and putting everything back where it went. By the time you\u2019d finished, John was already in the shower and letting the warm water soothe his aching muscles. His back was facing you as steam was coming from the water and encircling him. You couldn\u2019t help but admire him even if he was banged up. He was still absolutely beautiful and looked like he deserved to be on display in an art museum. His back muscles were proudly on display as he washed his hair, showcasing his tattoos clearly.</p><p>\u201cAre you just going to stand there and enjoy the show or are you going to join me, Y/N?\u201d He asked, breaking you from your thoughts as he looked back at you with a little smirk.</p><p>You blushed just a bit from being caught before you started removing your own clothes, which was one of John\u2019s shirts and a pair of sleep shorts. Once you were completely naked, you stepped into the shower behind him. He turned to face you and pulled you to him so that you were under the spray with him. Water fell on you both as John leaned down and kissed you. You kissed him back as one of his hands came up to cup your cheek. It lasted for a few long moments before you finally pulled away.</p><p>\u201cJohn, I told you no funny business,\u201d you playfully scolded him with a look. \u201cThis is supposed to be a shower only.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t help myself, sweetheart,\u201d he replied as he looked down at you. His dark eyes seemed to be captivating you.</p><p>You hummed before you kissed his lips again. When you pulled away, you smiled at him before you looked down. His bruised ribs caught your eye and made you frown. You gently and very carefully ran your fingers over the injured area.</p><p>\u201cI hate seeing you hurt, John,\u201d you spoke softly over the sound of the water. \u201cThis is the worst it\u2019s been, but this isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve came in hurt. I know you can take care of yourself. I just worry about you so much.\u201d</p><p>John placed his finger under your chin and lifted your head so that you were looking at him again. He placed a sweet kiss on your forehead. \u201cThis was my last job. I\u2019m out for good this time.\u201d</p><p>Your eyes widened a bit in surprise as he spoke those words. He was out? For real this time?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re out?\u201d You asked just to be clear and he nodded. \u201cNo more jobs whatsoever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more jobs,\u201d he said and smiled a little. \u201cI did what I had to do in order to leave. My debts and favors are paid. I\u2019m all yours now, sweetheart. I\u2019m officially retired.\u201d</p><p>You smiled real big and almost jumped into his arms, but you remembered his injuries. Instead you gave him a kiss full of love and passion, radiating your excitement for his news through it. He kissed you back with just as much love. He seemed excited to finally be out too.</p><p>\u201cI love you, John,\u201d you whispered when you finally pulled apart.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Y/N,\u201d he replied as he rested his forehead against yours.</p><p>You finished up in the shower, washing John with care and sharing kisses in between.
