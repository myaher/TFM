        "body": "<h1>The Rouge Avengers</h1><p>I was having the worst night. It couldn&rsquo;t be denied. I bet no superhero ever had to ditch his homecoming date to go fight her supervillain father and then rescue him after he blew himself up. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I was out of web fluid so I had to walk through alleyways to get home without being seen. I couldn&rsquo;t breathe properly through my mask which was stuffed in my pocket. It was really not my night. </p><p>*<b><i>Switches to third person POV  halfway through because fuck it*</i></b></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The sound of grunting from a nearby alleyway hit my ears. Multiple people were crying and it sounded like a fight was happening. Peter couldn&rsquo;t do much with burns covering his skin, cuts leaking blood, and bones that were guaranteed to be fractured. But Peter had a better chance of fighting these guys off then regular people. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 He slipped his mask back on, steadied himself on the wall while he took a deep breath than rushed forward. &ldquo;Hey! Didn&rsquo;t you ever hear it wasn&rsquo;t nice to pick on people?&rdquo; </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Peter tried to keep his voice from showing how purely exhausted he was, he tried to be sarcastic and his usual peppy self. A family were the victims, a dad, mom and three kids. He was normally a big crowd pleaser when it came to children, loving to play with them or show them cool tricks to calm them down. He even had selfies circulating the internet of him posing with Children he had helped. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This family didn&rsquo;t look nearly happy to see him but he couldn&rsquo;t stress on ot because the robbers were talking to him, saying words much to vile to repeat and threatening the father. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A gun was pulled from one of the men&rsquo;s waistband and aimed for the man. Peter reacted quick, without thought, throwing himself at the man closet to him. The guy with the gun aimed at Peter and pulled the trigger. The bullet found a target, burying itself in the soft flesh of Peter&rsquo;s shoulder. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Peter grunted. &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; Peter yelled at the woman who was standing there with her children. &ldquo;Go! Now!&rdquo; The woman cradled the youngest boy into her chest and ran for it, the little girl and boy runn behind her. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Peter didn&rsquo;t have time to watch as the gunman took a shot at the family, instead he kicked the hand holding the weapon. The bullet buried itself into a trash bag and the gun flew across the alley. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Peter felt his body give out before he registered the kick that swept his legs from under us. &ldquo;Aw, the famous Spiderman taken out by a couple of lowlife muggers.&rdquo; One of the men teased. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Peter&rsquo;s head was swimming. &ldquo;If I could get taken out that easy then that inspirational poster would be a real waste.&rdquo; </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The quip sucked, Peter knew it but hopefully it would distract them enough that he could come up with a plan. Any plan really. If he had his suit right now Karen would know what to do. He really wishes he had Karen right now. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 One of the muggers kicked Peter hard in the side. Peter grabbed the man&rsquo;s foot and pulled. He jumped up as the man went down and threw the dead weight at the man&rsquo;s companions. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 One of the men jumped out of the way. Peter turned to face his last opponent only to find him unconscious, held up by his collar in the hands of Hawkeye. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &ldquo;I knew it was suspicious for Tony to set up a date with my family.&rdquo; Hawkeye said angrily. Peter was to tired to focus on what he meant. His shoulder hurt, his head hurt and for some reason the ringing in his ears was getting louder. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Mr. Stark would try to mug you,&rdquo; Peter thought about what he said. &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t. If he did he wouldn&rsquo;t hire people to do it either.&rdquo; </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Hawkeye scoffed. &ldquo;You expect me to believe it&rsquo;s a coincidence that the Spider Kid from Germany just so happens to be where Tony told me to be?&rdquo; </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Peter couldn&rsquo;t really decipher what the man was saying, except for Mr. Stark knew that Hawkeye was here. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell Mr. Stark.&rdquo; His words came out slurred. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Hawkeye growled and raised his bow. Peter would have jumped if he had the energy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be shot again. I&rsquo;ll have to miss school at this rate.&rdquo; </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Hawkeye hesitated. &ldquo;School? How old are you kid?&rdquo;</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &ldquo;Man&hellip; I&rsquo;m&hellip;.a&hellip; m-&rdquo; Peter cut himself off as he crashed to the ground. Hawkeye didn&rsquo;t know what to do as he started at the collapsed vigilante. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 It wasn&rsquo;t until Hawkeye thought back on what he said that Clint realized the kid said shot again. Again. Clint looked at him this time, noticing the blood soaking through fabric, the soot covered skin visible through tears. The bullet wound in\u00a0 his shoulder. The bullet wound the kid got from saving his family. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 &ldquo;Crap,&rdquo; Clint said out loud. He was glad when Bucky and sam showed up to help him fight off the vigilante. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 &ldquo;Laura told us you got mugged and insect boy showed up.&rdquo; Sam looked at where Peter lay. A dizzy mumble came from the boy&rsquo;s lips. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &ldquo;Arachnid.&rdquo; Bucky snorted at the, apparently, half conscious kid. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Peter woke up what felt like days later. He was in a place he didn&rsquo;t recognize and he felt slightly off. His spider sense wasn&rsquo;t going off but he felt eyes watching him. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Peter turned around to see his mask laying on the floor nearby, a soft giggle sounded when he went to stand up. Peter jerked up and looked around. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The little girl from the alleyway was peeking at him from around the corner. Peter smiled softly. &ldquo;Well hi there.&rdquo; </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The girl seemed unsure of herself as she came fully into the room. She seemed extremely shy and Peter felt himself easing more into a comfortable situation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Peter, what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The girl didn&rsquo;t answer the question, asking one of her own. &ldquo;Why did you fight my daddy with the mean kitty man?&rdquo; </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Peter just smiled, not knowing how to answer the question. His brain was still fighting to put everything together and not freak out about his identity being revealed. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &ldquo;There were papers that wanted to hurt people like daddy and uncle Bucky and you wanted to.&rdquo; </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Peter&rsquo;s eyes widened in understanding. Hawkeye being in the alley, him talking about his family, Mr. Stark setting him up.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Peter knew that Mr. Stark so desperately missed his avengers family and that he would never set them up. Clearly there was still trust issues going on there. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Peter suddenly felt his spidey sense go off. It was very numb, it didn&rsquo;t say immediate danger but there was a sense of unease. &ldquo;Hey, kid? Where are we?&rdquo; </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The kid frowned. &ldquo;At our safehouse.&rdquo; </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 The words seemed to echo for a moment as Peter recalled the memory. Mr. Stark and Ross arguing this morning, arguing about Clint Barton, about hidden shield records, about a secret.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 The secret family who stayed in the secret safehouse. The safehouse that Riss had found out about. Peter swooped down to grab his mask off the ground. His wounds still stung when he moved but it was bearable thank to his healing factor. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your dad?&rdquo; Peter demanded the girl to tell him. The little girl frowned and crossed her arms. Peter held back a sigh. They thought he was a bad guy. Great. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &ldquo;Alright, I know you think I&rsquo;m a bad guy but I don&rsquo;t want to hurt you or your da-&rdquo; Peter got cut off as his spider sense went through the roof. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Peter hauled the girl up into his shoulder, she screamed as Peter ran down the stairs with her. As he turned the corner on the last step he was alerted in time to barely dodge a metal fist swung his way. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 &ldquo;Dude, What the fu-fudge?&rdquo; Peter remembered the children&rsquo;s presence last minute and changed his wording. As he was staring at the Winter Soldier, he was attacked from behind by Black Widow. </p><p>\u00a0 The girl that Peter was carrying jumped down and started to run towards her mother and Hawkeye. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Peter almost wanted to scream at them as he flipped onto the ceiling. Just as he was about to tell off the avengers attacking him he felt a sharp spike. He looked to see the girl he had been holding running past a window, the sound of a silenced gun going off had Peter moving. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 None of the others could hear it, but Peter could. He would not let anyone get shot but him, and maybe the Winter Solider. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 He dropped down and grabbed the girl, pulling her against his chest. The sound of a window shattering was all he heard before the bullet pierced his back. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 It was much to close to his spine for Peter to brush it off. He could have been paralyzed. He grunted and shoved the little girl towards Hawkeye, her father. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 &ldquo;Get them out. I should be able to buy you a few minutes, I need you all out by then,&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s voice was straining with the effort. He flexed his hands, checking his web shooters. Then he took a deep breath and spun to face the window. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 He barely heard the other Avengers screaming at him to wait before he launched through the window. The glass scrapped him, leaving small ribbons on blood across his sliced skin. He shot a web above where he thought the sniper was and pulled with all his might. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 His feet collided with the shoulders of the sniper and caused the man to fly back against another tree. He heard more guns being loaded. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 He took a deep breath, realizing that this was a fight he wouldn&rsquo;t win. If only he had Karen and his suit, she would know what to do. She would at least have a plan or a way to call Mr. Stark. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 No, Peter didn&rsquo;t need the suit but it sure would help. Peter spun, his bullet wound seemed to rip open even more and a waterfall of blood fell down his back, and shot a web at two guns. He yanked and the rifles flew to his hands. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 He used the butt of one gun to knock one agent out and then flipped over the other agent. He could feel sticky blood dripping down his back but the pain had seemed to flare before a numb sensation took over. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Peter knew that really wasn&rsquo;t good but he was mostly thankful for not being able to feel it, especially not when another bullet made his way through his thigh. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 With a scream of pain Peter fell to the ground. He raised his arm and shot a web up into the air. It was nothing but luck that the web struck something solid and Peter pulled himself away from the agents. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 He looked down in time to see a bullet strike the ground right where his head used to be.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Peter was pissed off. They had shot to kill him. They shot a bullet at a child. They were sent here to kill the rogue avengers and anyone who got in there way. Peter hated Ross but now he actually found himself wishing for the man to rot away.\u00a0 </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 With a calming breath Peter prepared to jump down and face the agents once more. Before he could a hand snaked around his mouth. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 &ldquo;Hush.&rdquo; The voice was familiar. Peter nodded and was released. Hawkeye aimed his bow and had all the agents on the ground in a span of seconds. &ldquo;Tranquilizers,&rdquo; he spoke. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Pete nodded, his vision was blurry and the tree seemed to sway. &ldquo;Come on, Kid. We need to get you to Stark.&rdquo; </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &ldquo;Mr. Stark is going to be so upset with me,&rdquo; Peter groaned. Hawkeye snorted, a sound that was half amusement and half distress. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &ldquo;Kid, if he isn&rsquo;t proud of you then he&rsquo;ll have a talk with the business end of my arrows.&rdquo; </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Peter grinned. His eyes slipped shut and he felt the wind rush past him. The same way it felt when he was swinging over the city. Calming, peaceful, free. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 He woke up several days later. He was hooked to more machines then he could count. The room was familiar this time, at least, and Peter called out to Friday. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 As soon as Mr. Stark walked in the door Peter knew he was right. Mr. Stark was upset and he was in for a long lecture<b><i>.</i></b></p>",

            "comment": "<p><h1>The Rouge Avengers</h1><p>I was having the worst night. It couldn\u2019t be denied. I bet no superhero ever had to ditch his homecoming date to go fight her supervillain father and then rescue him after he blew himself up. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I was out of web fluid so I had to walk through alleyways to get home without being seen. I couldn\u2019t breathe properly through my mask which was stuffed in my pocket. It was really not my night. </p><p>*<b><i>Switches to third person POV  halfway through because fuck it*</i></b></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The sound of grunting from a nearby alleyway hit my ears. Multiple people were crying and it sounded like a fight was happening. Peter couldn\u2019t do much with burns covering his skin, cuts leaking blood, and bones that were guaranteed to be fractured. But Peter had a better chance of fighting these guys off then regular people. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 He slipped his mask back on, steadied himself on the wall while he took a deep breath than rushed forward. \u201cHey! Didn\u2019t you ever hear it wasn\u2019t nice to pick on people?\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Peter tried to keep his voice from showing how purely exhausted he was, he tried to be sarcastic and his usual peppy self. A family were the victims, a dad, mom and three kids. He was normally a big crowd pleaser when it came to children, loving to play with them or show them cool tricks to calm them down. He even had selfies circulating the internet of him posing with Children he had helped. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This family didn\u2019t look nearly happy to see him but he couldn\u2019t stress on ot because the robbers were talking to him, saying words much to vile to repeat and threatening the father. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A gun was pulled from one of the men\u2019s waistband and aimed for the man. Peter reacted quick, without thought, throwing himself at the man closet to him. The guy with the gun aimed at Peter and pulled the trigger. The bullet found a target, burying itself in the soft flesh of Peter\u2019s shoulder. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Peter grunted. \u201cGo!\u201d Peter yelled at the woman who was standing there with her children. \u201cGo! Now!\u201d The woman cradled the youngest boy into her chest and ran for it, the little girl and boy runn behind her. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Peter didn\u2019t have time to watch as the gunman took a shot at the family, instead he kicked the hand holding the weapon. The bullet buried itself into a trash bag and the gun flew across the alley. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Peter felt his body give out before he registered the kick that swept his legs from under us. \u201cAw, the famous Spiderman taken out by a couple of lowlife muggers.\u201d One of the men teased. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Peter\u2019s head was swimming. \u201cIf I could get taken out that easy then that inspirational poster would be a real waste.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The quip sucked, Peter knew it but hopefully it would distract them enough that he could come up with a plan. Any plan really. If he had his suit right now Karen would know what to do. He really wishes he had Karen right now. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 One of the muggers kicked Peter hard in the side. Peter grabbed the man\u2019s foot and pulled. He jumped up as the man went down and threw the dead weight at the man\u2019s companions. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 One of the men jumped out of the way. Peter turned to face his last opponent only to find him unconscious, held up by his collar in the hands of Hawkeye. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI knew it was suspicious for Tony to set up a date with my family.\u201d Hawkeye said angrily. Peter was to tired to focus on what he meant. His shoulder hurt, his head hurt and for some reason the ringing in his ears was getting louder. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t think Mr. Stark would try to mug you,\u201d Peter thought about what he said. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t. If he did he wouldn\u2019t hire people to do it either.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Hawkeye scoffed. \u201cYou expect me to believe it\u2019s a coincidence that the Spider Kid from Germany just so happens to be where Tony told me to be?\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Peter couldn\u2019t really decipher what the man was saying, except for Mr. Stark knew that Hawkeye was here. \u201cDon\u2019t tell Mr. Stark.\u201d His words came out slurred. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Hawkeye growled and raised his bow. Peter would have jumped if he had the energy. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be shot again. I\u2019ll have to miss school at this rate.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Hawkeye hesitated. \u201cSchool? How old are you kid?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cMan\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026.a\u2026 m-\u201d Peter cut himself off as he crashed to the ground. Hawkeye didn\u2019t know what to do as he started at the collapsed vigilante. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t until Hawkeye thought back on what he said that Clint realized the kid said shot again. Again. Clint looked at him this time, noticing the blood soaking through fabric, the soot covered skin visible through tears. The bullet wound in\u00a0 his shoulder. The bullet wound the kid got from saving his family. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCrap,\u201d Clint said out loud. He was glad when Bucky and sam showed up to help him fight off the vigilante. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLaura told us you got mugged and insect boy showed up.\u201d Sam looked at where Peter lay. A dizzy mumble came from the boy\u2019s lips. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cArachnid.\u201d Bucky snorted at the, apparently, half conscious kid. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Peter woke up what felt like days later. He was in a place he didn\u2019t recognize and he felt slightly off. His spider sense wasn\u2019t going off but he felt eyes watching him. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Peter turned around to see his mask laying on the floor nearby, a soft giggle sounded when he went to stand up. Peter jerked up and looked around. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The little girl from the alleyway was peeking at him from around the corner. Peter smiled softly. \u201cWell hi there.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The girl seemed unsure of herself as she came fully into the room. She seemed extremely shy and Peter felt himself easing more into a comfortable situation. \u201cI\u2019m Peter, what\u2019s your name?\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The girl didn\u2019t answer the question, asking one of her own. \u201cWhy did you fight my daddy with the mean kitty man?\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Peter just smiled, not knowing how to answer the question. His brain was still fighting to put everything together and not freak out about his identity being revealed. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThere were papers that wanted to hurt people like daddy and uncle Bucky and you wanted to.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Peter\u2019s eyes widened in understanding.

I bet no superhero ever had to ditch his homecoming date to go fight her supervillain father and then rescue him after he blew himself up. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I was out of web fluid so I had to walk through alleyways to get home without being seen. I couldn\u2019t breathe properly through my mask which was stuffed in my pocket. It was really not my night. </p><p>*<b><i>Switches to third person POV  halfway through because fuck it*</i></b></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The sound of grunting from a nearby alleyway hit my ears. Multiple people were crying and it sounded like a fight was happening. Peter couldn\u2019t do much with burns covering his skin, cuts leaking blood, and bones that were guaranteed to be fractured. But Peter had a better chance of fighting these guys off then regular people. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 He slipped his mask back on, steadied himself on the wall while he took a deep breath than rushed forward. \u201cHey! Didn\u2019t you ever hear it wasn\u2019t nice to pick on people?\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Peter tried to keep his voice from showing how purely exhausted he was, he tried to be sarcastic and his usual peppy self. A family were the victims, a dad, mom and three kids. He was normally a big crowd pleaser when it came to children, loving to play with them or show them cool tricks to calm them down. He even had selfies circulating the internet of him posing with Children he had helped. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This family didn\u2019t look nearly happy to see him but he couldn\u2019t stress on ot because the robbers were talking to him, saying words much to vile to repeat and threatening the father. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A gun was pulled from one of the men\u2019s waistband and aimed for the man. Peter reacted quick, without thought, throwing himself at the man closet to him. The guy with the gun aimed at Peter and pulled the trigger. The bullet found a target, burying itself in the soft flesh of Peter\u2019s shoulder. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Peter grunted. \u201cGo!\u201d Peter yelled at the woman who was standing there with her children. \u201cGo! Now!\u201d The woman cradled the youngest boy into her chest and ran for it, the little girl and boy runn behind her. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Peter didn\u2019t have time to watch as the gunman took a shot at the family, instead he kicked the hand holding the weapon. The bullet buried itself into a trash bag and the gun flew across the alley. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Peter felt his body give out before he registered the kick that swept his legs from under us. \u201cAw, the famous Spiderman taken out by a couple of lowlife muggers.\u201d One of the men teased. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Peter\u2019s head was swimming. \u201cIf I could get taken out that easy then that inspirational poster would be a real waste.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The quip sucked, Peter knew it but hopefully it would distract them enough that he could come up with a plan. Any plan really. If he had his suit right now Karen would know what to do. He really wishes he had Karen right now. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 One of the muggers kicked Peter hard in the side. Peter grabbed the man\u2019s foot and pulled. He jumped up as the man went down and threw the dead weight at the man\u2019s companions. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 One of the men jumped out of the way. Peter turned to face his last opponent only to find him unconscious, held up by his collar in the hands of Hawkeye. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI knew it was suspicious for Tony to set up a date with my family.\u201d Hawkeye said angrily. Peter was to tired to focus on what he meant. His shoulder hurt, his head hurt and for some reason the ringing in his ears was getting louder. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t think Mr. Stark would try to mug you,\u201d Peter thought about what he said. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t. If he did he wouldn\u2019t hire people to do it either.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Hawkeye scoffed. \u201cYou expect me to believe it\u2019s a coincidence that the Spider Kid from Germany just so happens to be where Tony told me to be?\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Peter couldn\u2019t really decipher what the man was saying, except for Mr. Stark knew that Hawkeye was here. \u201cDon\u2019t tell Mr. Stark.\u201d His words came out slurred. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Hawkeye growled and raised his bow. Peter would have jumped if he had the energy. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be shot again. I\u2019ll have to miss school at this rate.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Hawkeye hesitated. \u201cSchool? How old are you kid?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cMan\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026.a\u2026 m-\u201d Peter cut himself off as he crashed to the ground. Hawkeye didn\u2019t know what to do as he started at the collapsed vigilante. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t until Hawkeye thought back on what he said that Clint realized the kid said shot again. Again. Clint looked at him this time, noticing the blood soaking through fabric, the soot covered skin visible through tears. The bullet wound in\u00a0 his shoulder. The bullet wound the kid got from saving his family. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCrap,\u201d Clint said out loud. He was glad when Bucky and sam showed up to help him fight off the vigilante. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLaura told us you got mugged and insect boy showed up.\u201d Sam looked at where Peter lay. A dizzy mumble came from the boy\u2019s lips. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cArachnid.\u201d Bucky snorted at the, apparently, half conscious kid. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Peter woke up what felt like days later. He was in a place he didn\u2019t recognize and he felt slightly off. His spider sense wasn\u2019t going off but he felt eyes watching him. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Peter turned around to see his mask laying on the floor nearby, a soft giggle sounded when he went to stand up. Peter jerked up and looked around. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The little girl from the alleyway was peeking at him from around the corner. Peter smiled softly. \u201cWell hi there.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The girl seemed unsure of herself as she came fully into the room. She seemed extremely shy and Peter felt himself easing more into a comfortable situation. \u201cI\u2019m Peter, what\u2019s your name?\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The girl didn\u2019t answer the question, asking one of her own. \u201cWhy did you fight my daddy with the mean kitty man?\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Peter just smiled, not knowing how to answer the question. His brain was still fighting to put everything together and not freak out about his identity being revealed. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThere were papers that wanted to hurt people like daddy and uncle Bucky and you wanted to.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Peter\u2019s eyes widened in understanding. Hawkeye being in the alley, him talking about his family, Mr. Stark setting him up.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Peter knew that Mr. Stark so desperately missed his avengers family and that he would never set them up. Clearly there was still trust issues going on there. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Peter suddenly felt his spidey sense go off. It was very numb, it didn\u2019t say immediate danger but there was a sense of unease. \u201cHey, kid? Where are we?\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The kid frowned. \u201cAt our safehouse.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 The words seemed to echo for a moment as Peter recalled the memory. Mr. Stark and Ross arguing this morning, arguing about Clint Barton, about hidden shield records, about a secret.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 The secret family who stayed in the secret safehouse. The safehouse that Riss had found out about. Peter swooped down to grab his mask off the ground. His wounds still stung when he moved but it was bearable thank to his healing factor. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhere\u2019s your dad?\u201d Peter demanded the girl to tell him. The little girl frowned and crossed her arms. Peter held back a sigh. They thought he was a bad guy. Great. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cAlright, I know you think I\u2019m a bad guy but I don\u2019t want to hurt you or your da-\u201d Peter got cut off as his spider sense went through the roof. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Peter hauled the girl up into his shoulder, she screamed as Peter ran down the stairs with her. As he turned the corner on the last step he was alerted in time to barely dodge a metal fist swung his way. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDude, What the fu-fudge?\u201d Peter remembered the children\u2019s presence last minute and changed his wording. As he was staring at the Winter Soldier, he was attacked from behind by Black Widow. </p><p>\u00a0 The girl that Peter was carrying jumped down and started to run towards her mother and Hawkeye. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Peter almost wanted to scream at them as he flipped onto the ceiling. Just as he was about to tell off the avengers attacking him he felt a sharp spike. He looked to see the girl he had been holding running past a window, the sound of a silenced gun going off had Peter moving. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 None of the others could hear it, but Peter could. He would not let anyone get shot but him, and maybe the Winter Solider. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 He dropped down and grabbed the girl, pulling her against his chest. The sound of a window shattering was all he heard before the bullet pierced his back. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 It was much to close to his spine for Peter to brush it off. He could have been paralyzed. He grunted and shoved the little girl towards Hawkeye, her father. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cGet them out. I should be able to buy you a few minutes, I need you all out by then,\u201d Peter\u2019s voice was straining with the effort. He flexed his hands, checking his web shooters. Then he took a deep breath and spun to face the window. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 He barely heard the other Avengers screaming at him to wait before he launched through the window. The glass scrapped him, leaving small ribbons on blood across his sliced skin. He shot a web above where he thought the sniper was and pulled with all his might. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 His feet collided with the shoulders of the sniper and caused the man to fly back against another tree. He heard more guns being loaded. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 He took a deep breath, realizing that this was a fight he wouldn\u2019t win. If only he had Karen and his suit, she would know what to do. She would at least have a plan or a way to call Mr. Stark. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 No, Peter didn\u2019t need the suit but it sure would help. Peter spun, his bullet wound seemed to rip open even more and a waterfall of blood fell down his back, and shot a web at two guns. He yanked and the rifles flew to his hands. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 He used the butt of one gun to knock one agent out and then flipped over the other agent. He could feel sticky blood dripping down his back but the pain had seemed to flare before a numb sensation took over. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Peter knew that really wasn\u2019t good but he was mostly thankful for not being able to feel it, especially not when another bullet made his way through his thigh. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 With a scream of pain Peter fell to the ground. He raised his arm and shot a web up into the air. It was nothing but luck that the web struck something solid and Peter pulled himself away from the agents. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 He looked down in time to see a bullet strike the ground right where his head used to be.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Peter was pissed off. They had shot to kill him. They shot a bullet at a child. They were sent here to kill the rogue avengers and anyone who got in there way. Peter hated Ross but now he actually found himself wishing for the man to rot away.\u00a0 </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 With a calming breath Peter prepared to jump down and face the agents once more. Before he could a hand snaked around his mouth. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHush.\u201d The voice was familiar. Peter nodded and was released. Hawkeye aimed his bow and had all the agents on the ground in a span of seconds. \u201cTranquilizers,\u201d he spoke. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Pete nodded, his vision was blurry and the tree seemed to sway. \u201cCome on, Kid. We need to get you to Stark.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cMr. Stark is going to be so upset with me,\u201d Peter groaned. Hawkeye snorted, a sound that was half amusement and half distress. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cKid, if he isn\u2019t proud of you then he\u2019ll have a talk with the business end of my arrows.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Peter grinned. His eyes slipped shut and he felt the wind rush past him. The same way it felt when he was swinging over the city. Calming, peaceful, free. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 He woke up several days later. He was hooked to more machines then he could count. The room was familiar this time, at least, and Peter called out to Friday. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 As soon as Mr. Stark walked in the door Peter knew he was right. Mr. Stark was upset and he was in for a long lecture<b><i>.</i></b></p></p>",

It was nothing but luck that the web struck something solid and Peter pulled himself away from the agents. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; He looked down in time to see a bullet strike the ground right where his head used to be.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Peter was pissed off. They had shot to kill him. They shot a bullet at a child. They were sent here to kill the rogue avengers and anyone who got in there way. Peter hated Ross but now he actually found himself wishing for the man to rot away.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; With a calming breath Peter prepared to jump down and face the agents once more. Before he could a hand snaked around his mouth. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hush.&rdquo; The voice was familiar. Peter nodded and was released. Hawkeye aimed his bow and had all the agents on the ground in a span of seconds. &ldquo;Tranquilizers,&rdquo; he spoke. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pete nodded, his vision was blurry and the tree seemed to sway. &ldquo;Come on, Kid. We need to get you to Stark.&rdquo; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Stark is going to be so upset with me,&rdquo; Peter groaned. Hawkeye snorted, a sound that was half amusement and half distress. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Kid, if he isn&rsquo;t proud of you then he&rsquo;ll have a talk with the business end of my arrows.&rdquo; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Peter grinned. His eyes slipped shut and he felt the wind rush past him. The same way it felt when he was swinging over the city. Calming, peaceful, free. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; He woke up several days later. He was hooked to more machines then he could count. The room was familiar this time, at least, and Peter called out to Friday. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as Mr. Stark walked in the door Peter knew he was right. Mr. Stark was upset and he was in for a long lecture<b><i>.</i></b></p></p>",
