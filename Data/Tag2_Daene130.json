This goes beyond the fact that they are canon and that their stories parallels each others in such an astonishing way that I am almost shy in admitting how much they fking mirror their paths in life. </p><p>By the way their multiple parallels can be found in so many metas (much better explained than how this answer could ever hope to be) that is pointless for me to keep repeating the same points about it&hellip;</p><p><b>But let&rsquo;s watch it from a psicological point of view shall we? </b></p><p>So let&rsquo;s start with Sansa, I&rsquo;ll not dig in that redhead bullshit cuz I find truly denigrating for a woman to be chosen for the colour of her hair. Is almost like being chosen for the size of her boobs. Love, true love goes way deeper than that FFS!! And Jon is surely not the one to chose his mate for those details only, what is he a bull in an arena?? (Lol at the end I dug into that haha sorry.)</p><p>Ah and Incest?? No sorry I&rsquo;ll not bury myself in that infinite discussion about what incest is the most incest between the two&hellip;I would keep laughing and sputtering my dinner cuz..come on lol</p><p>The things that I consider important are the actual dynamics in a healthy couple.</p><h2>LOVE IS UNDERSTANDING OF EACH OTHER&rsquo;S PRIORITIES</h2><p>Let&rsquo;s start again. I state it before: I don&rsquo;t hate Sansa&rsquo;s character, on the contrary I find that her ch.development has been one of the nicest and subtlest till now. So Sansa meets with Jon after years apart. They were the most distant from each other amongst their siblings but when they meet, since difficulties bring us together, they find a piece of their family again. Ok that&rsquo;s nice, sweet moment.</p><p>Then, after only a scene and a bit of reminiscence of the old days Sansa starts to be her petty self again.</p><p>She, who doesn&rsquo;t know a block about the freefolk already starts to count how many men Jon &lsquo;gained&rsquo; (not saved?) for himself. She is already focused on retaking Winterfell. She wants revenge against Ramsay. She doesn&rsquo;t give a shot that Jon could be still in a state of shock after being MURDERED. And that he maybe would like to take some time for himself away from all those battles. No one ever talks about how much of a shock a battle is. Cuz men usually keep their emotions well hidden inside them like wine barrels. And Jon experienced Hardhome, a fking MASSACRE. Oh and then he died. But this is not important cuz the princess wants her castle back. </p><p>Careful, I don&rsquo;t say that it was wrong to take Winterfell back for them (go Starks go\ud83d\udcaa) but it pains me that she didn&rsquo;t even took into consideration that Jon could suffer from his past experiences and not want to dive so soon in the middle of the melee. </p><p>The letter has been the ultimate trigger that pushed Jon to the BoB. And Rickon.</p><p>Oh and then she calls into question both his way of commanding an army (when she discusses with him about their numbers against Ramsay) AND his way of ruling (with the Umbers and Karstarks children) and only after having seen him treat the situation with justice she admits that he is good at ruling. After having compared him to no other than Joff&hellip;(someone should say to her that not everyone is a tricky sick megalomaniac King just cuz he doesn&rsquo;t do what she wants?)</p><p>Oh and has she forgotten to warn Jon (the commander of their army) of a huuuge number of chivalry soldiers from the vale? That maybe could be of help before their men were slaughtered? But this has been addressed multiple times already I think&hellip;</p><p>My point is that: not once in these scenes I saw them as a unite front. She is always challenging him in everything he does. And not in the good way, the one that makes you do better, but in an annoying and hindering way that does nothing to help Jon in what he does. Even when he decides to go South she blames him for abandoning his people when he is doing THE EXACT OPPOSITE. (Let&rsquo;s not talk about Jon and his questionable habit to not discuss previously his decisions, but hey&hellip;he&rsquo;s the King after all this is one of the advantages of the position I guess)</p><p>So we have Sansa that doesn&rsquo;t support him and just keeps getting in his way in everything he does&hellip;</p><p>And then we have Daenerys of House Targaryen, Queen of the Andals etc etc Mother of Dragons etc etc that starts with him in the exact opposite way. The first scene together alone is a telltale.</p><h2>LOVE IS CONSIDERING THE OTHER AS AN EQUAL</h2><p>She, who rightfully (from her past experiences and from the position of strength she comes in Westeros with) thinks herself in a higher/stronger position in that moment&hellip;she who has three fully grown dragons, who has the upper hand in every meaning in that room&hellip;she catches his signals</p><p>We have the first steps in their dance here.</p><p>She starts with her titles, he show her that titles mean nothing if the person who earned them isn&rsquo;t true to him/herself. Titles don&rsquo;t help with the dead. He&rsquo;s&hellip;King in the North? And many other things we know, but he is there for a higher purpose than showing how long he is able to piss.</p><p>The astonishing part is that she -who maybe was expecting to effectively have to show the length of her piss with a rude northener and stuck-up King- she understand that she has an equal in front of her. And immediately start to even the ground. </p><p>She goes down those steps that she (both figuratively and concretely) built to show that she was in a higher position of power. She 'flies down&rsquo; immediately and meets him on even ground. She catches immediately his desire to meet her in the middle and talk face to face. They share their experiences, and this is useful also to Jon, cuz he understand that he isn&rsquo;t in front of a simple woman, but a warrior that endured many atrocities. Like him.</p><p>The second scene with them together is the exact opposite of what happened with Sansa. She gives him access to the dragonglass mines.</p><p>I&rsquo;m sorry what???</p><p>She gives him something without giving him nothing in the words of Tyrion yeah. Politically this is smart. But she effectively took a step towards him voluntarily.</p><h2>LOVE IS LISTENING TO EACH OTHER DESIRES</h2><p>She listened to him, she took in account what he needed, and she fking gave it to him, without expecting anything in return. She didn&rsquo;t say: bend the knee and you&rsquo;ll have the dragonglass, she could&rsquo;ve done it, but she didn&rsquo;t. She talked with Tyrion about alliance without specifically talking about bending knees there. They are trying to build the first steps that could help both. </p><p>Then she starts to trust him more. And to know him more. And to believe in his story about ice zombies. And to consider to put aside her personal war to follow him with her whole army north&hellip;SHE PUTS HER WHOLE ARMY MADE OF FLESH AND BONES AND PEOPLE AND BRAINS AND MUSCLE, THAT SHE GAINED WITH COUNTLESS EFFORTS at Jon&rsquo;s service for 'his&rsquo; war, based on his words and some drawings on a wall, and she is offering all of this to him, she is ready to go, if he bends the knee than it is done. She goes. I am sorry if I don&rsquo;t understand the whole bending the knee issue. He knows what she wants when he departed from the North, and if she had withdrawn her request at some point of the story then she would have surely been addressed as weak and standoffish. </p><p>Anyway&hellip;</p><p>Can I just step over the whole 'she put in danger her son and her safety for him&rsquo; and go directly to the fact that Dany did a whole flip regardimg our favourite northern fool. She started from supposing he had to be bent to her will because of her previous experiences with men of power in general, thinking that she had some rights over him and over his title, to being unsure about the fact that she is deserving of his trust? That she is enough to be his Queen?</p><p>For me the most intimate and naked and meaningful scene between them was when Jon wakes up and finds her there. Waiting for him. Supporting him in a difficult moment. Guarding him when he is in his weakest state and NOT judging him for his decisions but instead admitting her errors. Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen admits that she thinks she could have done better. To a man. Something like this, I think, is the most trusting thing that a strong woman -that had earned her power showing men that she is stronger than them- can do. She andmits her doubts to him. 'Am I worthy of your thrust Jon? I hope it because I understood that you are a great man and your trust is something more precious than a simple allegiance&rsquo; that&rsquo;s what she low-key said during that hand holding. </p><p>I am sorry that all these little nuances sometimes don&rsquo;t reach the eyes and ears of someone or that some people just want to see what they WANT to see&hellip;anyway those people should be aware that Game of Thrones isn&rsquo;t just a sitcom where people shout what they feel in endless rants shaking hands in the air.</p><p>Now. I think I kept this long enough to cut it here. Also cuz I have to go and I don&rsquo;t know how to save an ask from the mobile phone without losing everything I wrote lol. Nonono, I cut it here and whatever other question is well accepted. </p><p>I hope I answered your question kind anon and have a nice day.</p>",

(Let\u2019s not talk about Jon and his questionable habit to not discuss previously his decisions, but hey\u2026he\u2019s the King after all this is one of the advantages of the position I guess)</p><p>So we have Sansa that doesn\u2019t support him and just keeps getting in his way in everything he does\u2026</p><p>And then we have Daenerys of House Targaryen, Queen of the Andals etc etc Mother of Dragons etc etc that starts with him in the exact opposite way. The first scene together alone is a telltale.</p><h2>LOVE IS CONSIDERING THE OTHER AS AN EQUAL</h2><p>She, who rightfully (from her past experiences and from the position of strength she comes in Westeros with) thinks herself in a higher/stronger position in that moment\u2026she who has three fully grown dragons, who has the upper hand in every meaning in that room\u2026she catches his signals</p><p>We have the first steps in their dance here.</p><p>She starts with her titles, he show her that titles mean nothing if the person who earned them isn\u2019t true to him/herself. Titles don\u2019t help with the dead. He\u2019s\u2026King in the North? And many other things we know, but he is there for a higher purpose than showing how long he is able to piss.</p><p>The astonishing part is that she -who maybe was expecting to effectively have to show the length of her piss with a rude northener and stuck-up King- she understand that she has an equal in front of her. And immediately start to even the ground. </p><p>She goes down those steps that she (both figuratively and concretely) built to show that she was in a higher position of power. She 'flies down\u2019 immediately and meets him on even ground. She catches immediately his desire to meet her in the middle and talk face to face. They share their experiences, and this is useful also to Jon, cuz he understand that he isn\u2019t in front of a simple woman, but a warrior that endured many atrocities. Like him.</p><p>The second scene with them together is the exact opposite of what happened with Sansa. She gives him access to the dragonglass mines.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry what???</p><p>She gives him something without giving him nothing in the words of Tyrion yeah. Politically this is smart. But she effectively took a step towards him voluntarily.</p><h2>LOVE IS LISTENING TO EACH OTHER DESIRES</h2><p>She listened to him, she took in account what he needed, and she fking gave it to him, without expecting anything in return. She didn\u2019t say: bend the knee and you\u2019ll have the dragonglass, she could\u2019ve done it, but she didn\u2019t. She talked with Tyrion about alliance without specifically talking about bending knees there. They are trying to build the first steps that could help both. </p><p>Then she starts to trust him more. And to know him more. And to believe in his story about ice zombies. And to consider to put aside her personal war to follow him with her whole army north\u2026SHE PUTS HER WHOLE ARMY MADE OF FLESH AND BONES AND PEOPLE AND BRAINS AND MUSCLE, THAT SHE GAINED WITH COUNTLESS EFFORTS at Jon\u2019s service for 'his\u2019 war, based on his words and some drawings on a wall, and she is offering all of this to him, she is ready to go, if he bends the knee than it is done. She goes. I am sorry if I don\u2019t understand the whole bending the knee issue. He knows what she wants when he departed from the North, and if she had withdrawn her request at some point of the story then she would have surely been addressed as weak and standoffish. </p><p>Anyway\u2026</p><p>Can I just step over the whole 'she put in danger her son and her safety for him\u2019 and go directly to the fact that Dany did a whole flip regardimg our favourite northern fool. She started from supposing he had to be bent to her will because of her previous experiences with men of power in general, thinking that she had some rights over him and over his title, to being unsure about the fact that she is deserving of his trust? That she is enough to be his Queen?</p><p>For me the most intimate and naked and meaningful scene between them was when Jon wakes up and finds her there. Waiting for him. Supporting him in a difficult moment. Guarding him when he is in his weakest state and NOT judging him for his decisions but instead admitting her errors. Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen admits that she thinks she could have done better. To a man. Something like this, I think, is the most trusting thing that a strong woman -that had earned her power showing men that she is stronger than them- can do. She andmits her doubts to him. 'Am I worthy of your thrust Jon? I hope it because I understood that you are a great man and your trust is something more precious than a simple allegiance\u2019 that\u2019s what she low-key said during that hand holding. </p><p>I am sorry that all these little nuances sometimes don\u2019t reach the eyes and ears of someone or that some people just want to see what they WANT to see\u2026anyway those people should be aware that Game of Thrones isn\u2019t just a sitcom where people shout what they feel in endless rants shaking hands in the air.</p><p>Now. I think I kept this long enough to cut it here. Also cuz I have to go and I don\u2019t know how to save an ask from the mobile phone without losing everything I wrote lol.

This goes beyond the fact that they are canon and that their stories parallels each others in such an astonishing way that I am almost shy in admitting how much they fking mirror their paths in life. </p><p>By the way their multiple parallels can be found in so many metas (much better explained than how this answer could ever hope to be) that is pointless for me to keep repeating the same points about it\u2026</p><p><b>But let\u2019s watch it from a psicological point of view shall we? </b></p><p>So let\u2019s start with Sansa, I\u2019ll not dig in that redhead bullshit cuz I find truly denigrating for a woman to be chosen for the colour of her hair. Is almost like being chosen for the size of her boobs. Love, true love goes way deeper than that FFS!! And Jon is surely not the one to chose his mate for those details only, what is he a bull in an arena?? (Lol at the end I dug into that haha sorry.)</p><p>Ah and Incest?? No sorry I\u2019ll not bury myself in that infinite discussion about what incest is the most incest between the two\u2026I would keep laughing and sputtering my dinner cuz..come on lol</p><p>The things that I consider important are the actual dynamics in a healthy couple.</p><h2>LOVE IS UNDERSTANDING OF EACH OTHER\u2019S PRIORITIES</h2><p>Let\u2019s start again. I state it before: I don\u2019t hate Sansa\u2019s character, on the contrary I find that her ch.development has been one of the nicest and subtlest till now. So Sansa meets with Jon after years apart. They were the most distant from each other amongst their siblings but when they meet, since difficulties bring us together, they find a piece of their family again. Ok that\u2019s nice, sweet moment.</p><p>Then, after only a scene and a bit of reminiscence of the old days Sansa starts to be her petty self again.</p><p>She, who doesn\u2019t know a block about the freefolk already starts to count how many men Jon \u2018gained\u2019 (not saved?) for himself. She is already focused on retaking Winterfell. She wants revenge against Ramsay. She doesn\u2019t give a shot that Jon could be still in a state of shock after being MURDERED. And that he maybe would like to take some time for himself away from all those battles. No one ever talks about how much of a shock a battle is. Cuz men usually keep their emotions well hidden inside them like wine barrels. And Jon experienced Hardhome, a fking MASSACRE. Oh and then he died. But this is not important cuz the princess wants her castle back. </p><p>Careful, I don\u2019t say that it was wrong to take Winterfell back for them (go Starks go\ud83d\udcaa) but it pains me that she didn\u2019t even took into consideration that Jon could suffer from his past experiences and not want to dive so soon in the middle of the melee. </p><p>The letter has been the ultimate trigger that pushed Jon to the BoB. And Rickon.</p><p>Oh and then she calls into question both his way of commanding an army (when she discusses with him about their numbers against Ramsay) AND his way of ruling (with the Umbers and Karstarks children) and only after having seen him treat the situation with justice she admits that he is good at ruling. After having compared him to no other than Joff\u2026(someone should say to her that not everyone is a tricky sick megalomaniac King just cuz he doesn\u2019t do what she wants?)</p><p>Oh and has she forgotten to warn Jon (the commander of their army) of a huuuge number of chivalry soldiers from the vale? That maybe could be of help before their men were slaughtered? But this has been addressed multiple times already I think\u2026</p><p>My point is that: not once in these scenes I saw them as a unite front. She is always challenging him in everything he does. And not in the good way, the one that makes you do better, but in an annoying and hindering way that does nothing to help Jon in what he does. Even when he decides to go South she blames him for abandoning his people when he is doing THE EXACT OPPOSITE.

The prompts have been provided and the stories have all been written and I gotta say you&rsquo;re in for a lot of Jonerys content. So Day 5, 18th February, which is when I&rsquo;m uploading this, the prompt I chose was &lsquo;Snowed In&rsquo;. Argument&rsquo;s anyone?</p><p>Link:\u00a0<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17841860\">https://archiveofourown.org/works/17841860</a></p><p>&mdash;-</p><p>She knew they should not have embarked on the mission, but there had been sightings of stranded northerners on the kingsroad due west from Winterfell and now, a snow storm meant herself and Jon Snow, were trapped inside a cavern, waiting until the snow passed before they could get out and find the King in the North&rsquo;s subjects.</p><p>It would\u2019ve have been okay, had the King in the North not been ignoring her for the past week after they had been told by his younger brother, Bran, that they were related. Jon Snow, King In The North, True Heir to the Iron Throne, hidden in plain sight under snow.</p><p>Daenerys had plenty of time to think on the revelation, and in all honesty wished there was some way she could curse her forgotten, older brother in the beyond for being a stupid idiot and causing a war which could have been avoid had both himself and Lady Lyanna told the truth.</p><p>The ruin of my house\u2026</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cWe should get a fire going, if we\u2019re here overnight we\u2019ll freeze before we can see tomorrow\u201d She states, brushing the snow out of her houses hair and reaching to the back of the horse and pulling some logs of wood they\u2019re packed for the small journey. Daenerys wasn&rsquo;t going to put up with it if the moping continued.</p><p>They\u2019d lost the men they\u2019d rode out with, everyone going off in separate direction but Daenerys staying hot on Jon\u2019s tail as not to be completely out in the wilderness by herself. She\u2019d made a good decision, even if Jon was just communicating in grunts and huffs.</p><p>On cue, he sighs in frustration and they both begin to work away at setting up a camp inside the cavern, which when you had two horses inside it with you, did not make for much room. The half an hour they spend getting things set up gives Dany a chance to think things over.</p><p>She\u2019d spent her life in foreign lands, running and fleeing, city to city for fear of death and the end of the last two remaining Targaryens. She hadn\u2019t known a mother or father, she\u2019d only know Viserys cruel contempt. Somehow, after all these years, on opposite sides of the world, she\u2019d found someone, someone of her blood, someone she loved very much, someone who understand that outcast feeling.</p><p>The fall of her house, all of it was a lie. Robert Baratheon, the piggish bastard, thinking with his cock as so many men do. She did not love him back, she loved her brother, Rhaegar, a man who supposedly kidnapped her and raped her, a man who she was told by many that was a man who loved singing and playing his harp.</p><p>She did not know if the gods were real, in her eyes they were all vicious and spiteful, but there was something said of a destiny in which the last two dragons find each other and defeat the darkness that is coming for all of them. She always thought she\u2019d marry Viserys, or perhaps Aegon had he been alive and the Targaryens still ruled.</p><p>Maybe if everything hadn\u2019t gone wrong, she\u2019d have married Jon anyways, cruel a fate to leave a boy in the dark for so long, in the frozen north and unaware of the power he holds, unaware of his birthright. But he\u2019d would\u2019ve been raised in the capital, like the royalty he was, like the dragon blood than ran through his veins. She would\u2019ve too. Maybe they would\u2019ve married, who knew?</p><p>\u201cYou should get some rest\u201d His voice is void of emotion, an order more than a phrase of concern. It doesn\u2019t sit well with Daenerys, in fact it make her want to unleash her tongue and give Jon a piece of her mind.</p><p>\u201cI will\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s all she says, unrolling a padded mat so as she can lay down on it and sleep. She careful takes a seat by the fire, and feels the warmth roll over her skin. She looks into the flames of the fire and wonders if the day will come where she is burn by it. She feels steel look back at her and a resolute feeling sweeps across her skin.</p><p>I\u2019m Daenerys of House Targaryen, and this idiot will listen to me .</p><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s enough\u201d She decides. \u201cWe need to talk\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we do\u201d He gruffs.</p><p>\u201cJon Snow, you will not continue to ignore your queen\u201d She\u2019s harsh but it\u2019s called for. Her gaze catches his and in the firelight, she sees a wall he\u2019s built up around himself. She wants to be able to communicate with him. \u201cWe are to lead our people into safety, lead them away from danger and defeat that oncoming storm together and you can\u2019t even look at me?\u201d</p><p>Jon is frozen in his spot.</p><p>\u201cAre you ashamed of me? Is that it?\u201d She demands to know, she can take the heartache if he\u2019s ashamed of it, but she is not. She loves him and he knows it, they both do. But the fact that he was blocking her out completely\u2026</p><p>\u201cNo, of course I\u2019m not ashamed of you, \u201d He softens slightly.</p><p>\u201cThen stop shutting me out\u201d She demands again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not, I really not trying to\u201d He softens more.</p><p>\u201cThen stop acting like you can\u2019t even look at me, it hurts, Jon. Please tell me why you are shutting me out?\u201d She\u2019s brave, even if tears threaten to be exposed to their cold encounter. \u201cDoes it occur to you that I am in the same boat as you? That finding out your heritage is as much of a difficult thing to process for me? Perhaps not\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand\u201d He countered. \u201cIt is different for you\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just is, okay?\u201d He throws his hands up in defence, his voice hoarse and gruff. \u201cAll my life I\u2019ve dealt with the shame that came with being a bastard, yes a high born bastard, but a bastard nonetheless. Lady Catelyn treated me like horse shit and I never blamed her for it, I got to the Night\u2019s Watch thinking things would be different, a place full of outcasts, and it wasn\u2019t. I was abused for that word, and it was all for nothing. All the shame that came to our family, all the horror it has endured is because, that piece of Baratheon Horsepiss couldn\u2019t use his eyes instead of his pecker!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t mean to speak ill of the dead, I really don\u2019t, but my mother died birthing me, she was alone, she had no one! All because that man meddled in a love he didn\u2019t understand, all because he killed my true father. My father, died with my mother\u2019s name on her lips, that&rsquo;s what Bran said, his rubies floating in the river, and never knowing a son that he would have. Everything that wretched King did, House Stark was over as soon as he was crowned\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut House Stark isn\u2019t over, it\u2019s stronger than ever and under tremendous leadership. And where are the Baratheons? Dead in the ground where the usurpers belong!\u201d She scooted over to sit closer to him. \u201cHe hunted me down too, remember? A girl pregnant with a son, a girl no older than his own son, and he sent assassins to stab her in the belly. I have as much reason to hate that man as you do, but there is no point anymore, he\u2019s dead. And we\u2019re alive\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd related, he never suspected\u201d Jon never striked Dany as a man who would process feelings well, and yet so much of why she liked him was because of his kindness, his moral compass. And that wouldn\u2019t change, she loved him all the same.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care that you have Dragon blood, I don\u2019t care that you have a higher claim than me to the throne, I care about you, only you\u201d She warms her hands by the fire. \u201cI always thought I\u2019d marry my brother, and then I was alone. I\u2019m not alone anymore\u201d</p><p>The truth rang through the room like a bell clear as day. It was one she was hoping would be clarified, and she knew he couldn\u2019t deny the attraction and affection he had towards her too. You\u2019re an idiot, Jon Snow, but I understand you so well.</p><p>\u201cMy lord-father lied to me\u201d He says out the blue.</p><p>\u201cTo protect you\u201d Daenerys countered.</p><p>\u201cI know that\u201d He huffs again. \u201cDoesn\u2019t make me any less unhappy about it\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis truth, is difficult to process. I found you, across the entire world and living completely separate lives, and I still found you. We were meant to meet, Jon, we were meant to save this world together and start a new one, where we\u2019re all free and where justice and democracy matter. No lions and Krakens or Snakes and Eagles, just the Dragons and the Wolves, ushering in a new era of peace\u201d</p><p>She placed her hand on his knee, wanting to touch him like they had each other so many times before. But she\u2019s gentle, loving like a woman could be and as forgiving as she\u2019s ever learned to be. \u201cI don\u2019t want any part of the throne, or power. I never have\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but it is your destiny, Jon Snow\u201d</p><p>\u201cDestiny is what you make it, all I try to do, is the right thing\u201d He shrugs.</p><p>\u201cThen you might want to start by being nicer to your future wife and family\u201d She kisses him softly on the cheek before laying down on her mat and preparing herself for a wait until the snow storm let up. Could be hours or a few days, but at least that issue was resolved.</p>",

The prompts have been provided and the stories have all been written and I gotta say you\u2019re in for a lot of Jonerys content. So Day 5, 18th February, which is when I\u2019m uploading this, the prompt I chose was \u2018Snowed In\u2019. Argument\u2019s anyone?</p><p>Link:\u00a0<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17841860\">https://archiveofourown.org/works/17841860</a></p><p>\u2014-</p><p>She knew they should not have embarked on the mission, but there had been sightings of stranded northerners on the kingsroad due west from Winterfell and now, a snow storm meant herself and Jon Snow, were trapped inside a cavern, waiting until the snow passed before they could get out and find the King in the North\u2019s subjects.</p><p>It would\u2019ve have been okay, had the King in the North not been ignoring her for the past week after they had been told by his younger brother, Bran, that they were related. Jon Snow, King In The North, True Heir to the Iron Throne, hidden in plain sight under snow.</p><p>Daenerys had plenty of time to think on the revelation, and in all honesty wished there was some way she could curse her forgotten, older brother in the beyond for being a stupid idiot and causing a war which could have been avoid had both himself and Lady Lyanna told the truth.</p><p>The ruin of my house\u2026</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cWe should get a fire going, if we\u2019re here overnight we\u2019ll freeze before we can see tomorrow\u201d She states, brushing the snow out of her houses hair and reaching to the back of the horse and pulling some logs of wood they\u2019re packed for the small journey. Daenerys wasn\u2019t going to put up with it if the moping continued.</p><p>They\u2019d lost the men they\u2019d rode out with, everyone going off in separate direction but Daenerys staying hot on Jon\u2019s tail as not to be completely out in the wilderness by herself. She\u2019d made a good decision, even if Jon was just communicating in grunts and huffs.</p><p>On cue, he sighs in frustration and they both begin to work away at setting up a camp inside the cavern, which when you had two horses inside it with you, did not make for much room. The half an hour they spend getting things set up gives Dany a chance to think things over.</p><p>She\u2019d spent her life in foreign lands, running and fleeing, city to city for fear of death and the end of the last two remaining Targaryens. She hadn\u2019t known a mother or father, she\u2019d only know Viserys cruel contempt. Somehow, after all these years, on opposite sides of the world, she\u2019d found someone, someone of her blood, someone she loved very much, someone who understand that outcast feeling.</p><p>The fall of her house, all of it was a lie. Robert Baratheon, the piggish bastard, thinking with his cock as so many men do. She did not love him back, she loved her brother, Rhaegar, a man who supposedly kidnapped her and raped her, a man who she was told by many that was a man who loved singing and playing his harp.</p><p>She did not know if the gods were real, in her eyes they were all vicious and spiteful, but there was something said of a destiny in which the last two dragons find each other and defeat the darkness that is coming for all of them. She always thought she\u2019d marry Viserys, or perhaps Aegon had he been alive and the Targaryens still ruled.</p><p>Maybe if everything hadn\u2019t gone wrong, she\u2019d have married Jon anyways, cruel a fate to leave a boy in the dark for so long, in the frozen north and unaware of the power he holds, unaware of his birthright. But he\u2019d would\u2019ve been raised in the capital, like the royalty he was, like the dragon blood than ran through his veins. She would\u2019ve too. Maybe they would\u2019ve married, who knew?</p><p>\u201cYou should get some rest\u201d His voice is void of emotion, an order more than a phrase of concern. It doesn\u2019t sit well with Daenerys, in fact it make her want to unleash her tongue and give Jon a piece of her mind.</p><p>\u201cI will\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s all she says, unrolling a padded mat so as she can lay down on it and sleep. She careful takes a seat by the fire, and feels the warmth roll over her skin. She looks into the flames of the fire and wonders if the day will come where she is burn by it. She feels steel look back at her and a resolute feeling sweeps across her skin.</p><p>I\u2019m Daenerys of House Targaryen, and this idiot will listen to me .</p><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s enough\u201d She decides. \u201cWe need to talk\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we do\u201d He gruffs.</p><p>\u201cJon Snow, you will not continue to ignore your queen\u201d She\u2019s harsh but it\u2019s called for. Her gaze catches his and in the firelight, she sees a wall he\u2019s built up around himself. She wants to be able to communicate with him. \u201cWe are to lead our people into safety, lead them away from danger and defeat that oncoming storm together and you can\u2019t even look at me?\u201d</p><p>Jon is frozen in his spot.</p><p>\u201cAre you ashamed of me? Is that it?\u201d She demands to know, she can take the heartache if he\u2019s ashamed of it, but she is not. She loves him and he knows it, they both do. But the fact that he was blocking her out completely\u2026</p><p>\u201cNo, of course I\u2019m not ashamed of you, \u201d He softens slightly.</p><p>\u201cThen stop shutting me out\u201d She demands again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not, I really not trying to\u201d He softens more.</p><p>\u201cThen stop acting like you can\u2019t even look at me, it hurts, Jon. Please tell me why you are shutting me out?\u201d She\u2019s brave, even if tears threaten to be exposed to their cold encounter. \u201cDoes it occur to you that I am in the same boat as you? That finding out your heritage is as much of a difficult thing to process for me? Perhaps not\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand\u201d He countered. \u201cIt is different for you\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just is, okay?\u201d He throws his hands up in defence, his voice hoarse and gruff. \u201cAll my life I\u2019ve dealt with the shame that came with being a bastard, yes a high born bastard, but a bastard nonetheless. Lady Catelyn treated me like horse shit and I never blamed her for it, I got to the Night\u2019s Watch thinking things would be different, a place full of outcasts, and it wasn\u2019t. I was abused for that word, and it was all for nothing. All the shame that came to our family, all the horror it has endured is because, that piece of Baratheon Horsepiss couldn\u2019t use his eyes instead of his pecker!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t mean to speak ill of the dead, I really don\u2019t, but my mother died birthing me, she was alone, she had no one! All because that man meddled in a love he didn\u2019t understand, all because he killed my true father. My father, died with my mother\u2019s name on her lips, that\u2019s what Bran said, his rubies floating in the river, and never knowing a son that he would have. Everything that wretched King did, House Stark was over as soon as he was crowned\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut House Stark isn\u2019t over, it\u2019s stronger than ever and under tremendous leadership. And where are the Baratheons? Dead in the ground where the usurpers belong!\u201d She scooted over to sit closer to him. \u201cHe hunted me down too, remember? A girl pregnant with a son, a girl no older than his own son, and he sent assassins to stab her in the belly. I have as much reason to hate that man as you do, but there is no point anymore, he\u2019s dead. And we\u2019re alive\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd related, he never suspected\u201d Jon never striked Dany as a man who would process feelings well, and yet so much of why she liked him was because of his kindness, his moral compass. And that wouldn\u2019t change, she loved him all the same.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care that you have Dragon blood, I don\u2019t care that you have a higher claim than me to the throne, I care about you, only you\u201d She warms her hands by the fire. \u201cI always thought I\u2019d marry my brother, and then I was alone. I\u2019m not alone anymore\u201d</p><p>The truth rang through the room like a bell clear as day. It was one she was hoping would be clarified, and she knew he couldn\u2019t deny the attraction and affection he had towards her too. You\u2019re an idiot, Jon Snow, but I understand you so well.</p><p>\u201cMy lord-father lied to me\u201d He says out the blue.</p><p>\u201cTo protect you\u201d Daenerys countered.</p><p>\u201cI know that\u201d He huffs again. \u201cDoesn\u2019t make me any less unhappy about it\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis truth, is difficult to process. I found you, across the entire world and living completely separate lives, and I still found you. We were meant to meet, Jon, we were meant to save this world together and start a new one, where we\u2019re all free and where justice and democracy matter. No lions and Krakens or Snakes and Eagles, just the Dragons and the Wolves, ushering in a new era of peace\u201d</p><p>She placed her hand on his knee, wanting to touch him like they had each other so many times before. But she\u2019s gentle, loving like a woman could be and as forgiving as she\u2019s ever learned to be. \u201cI don\u2019t want any part of the throne, or power. I never have\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but it is your destiny, Jon Snow\u201d</p><p>\u201cDestiny is what you make it, all I try to do, is the right thing\u201d He shrugs.</p><p>\u201cThen you might want to start by being nicer to your future wife and family\u201d She kisses him softly on the cheek before laying down on her mat and preparing herself for a wait until the snow storm let up. Could be hours or a few days, but at least that issue was resolved.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Much has been said about how Aegon is a deconstruction of hero tropes and how his story is supposed to feel cheap and unearned. And I think what highlights this the most is just how different Dany and Aegon are.</p><p><b>1)</b> Aegon has been sheltered his entire life. This is what Tyrion remarks of him:</p><blockquote><p>The lad did not seem appeased. <b>The perfect prince but still half a boy for all that, with little and less experience of the world and all its woes.</b> \u2013 Tyrion VI ADWD</p></blockquote><p>He grew up with a father figure (Jon Connington), and we know how Illyrio pampered him:</p><blockquote><p><b>&ldquo;There is a gift for the boy in one of the chests. Some candied ginger. He was always fond of it.&rdquo;</b> Illyrio sounded oddly sad. \u2013 Tyrion III ADWD</p></blockquote><p>In Dany\u2019s first chapter, we see how her life has been the opposite. Her only caregiver is a brother who abuses her, and we see how she has experience with the world and it\u2019s woes:</p><blockquote><p><b>After Ser Willem had died, the servants had stolen what little money they had left, and soon after they had been put out of the big house.</b> Dany had cried when the red door closed behind them forever.</p><p><b>They had wandered since then, from Braavos to Myr, from Myr to Tyrosh, and on to Qohor and Volantis and Lys, never staying long in any one place. </b>Her brother would not allow it. The Usurper&rsquo;s hired knives were close behind them, he insisted, though Dany had never seen one.</p><p>At first the magisters and archons and merchant princes were pleased to welcome the last Targaryens to their homes and tables, but <b>as the years passed and the Usurper continued to sit upon the Iron Throne, doors closed and their lives grew meaner. Years past they had been forced to sell their last few treasures, and now even the coin they had gotten from Mother&rsquo;s crown had gone.</b> In the alleys and wine sinks of Pentos, they called her brother &ldquo;the beggar king.&rdquo; Dany did not want to know what they called her. \u2013 Daenerys I AGOT</p></blockquote><p>She was not pampered. While Illyrio gave Aegon candied ginger (and I imagine many other gifts), Dany almost never could get things that she wanted, and for her, it was a big joy when she could indeed buy something:</p><blockquote><p><b>&ldquo;When I was a little girl, I loved to play in the bazaar,&rdquo;</b> Dany told Ser Jorah as they wandered down the shady aisle between the stalls. &ldquo;It was so alive there, all the people shouting and laughing, <b>so many wonderful things to look at \u2026 though we seldom had enough coin to buy anything \u2026 well, except for a sausage now and again, or honeyfingers \u2026</b> do they have honeyfingers in the Seven Kingdoms, the kind they bake in Tyrosh?&rdquo; \u2013 Daenerys VI AGOT</p></blockquote><p><b>2)</b> Dany seems to have learned from her experience in the streets, unlike Aegon, who was sheltered:</p><blockquote><p><b>&ldquo;Why does he give us so much?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;What does he want from us?&rdquo; </b>For nigh on half a year, they had lived in the magister&rsquo;s house, eating his food, pampered by his servants. <b>Dany was thirteen, old enough to know that such gifts seldom come without their price, here in the free city of Pentos </b>[&hellip;]Magister Illyrio was a dealer in spices, gemstones, dragonbone, and other, less savory things. He had friends in all of the Nine Free Cities, it was said, and even beyond, in Vaes Dothrak and the fabled lands beside the Jade Sea. <b>It was also said that he&rsquo;d never had a friend he wouldn&rsquo;t cheerfully sell for the right price. Dany listened to the talk in the streets, and she heard these things,</b> but she knew better than to question her brother when he wove his webs of dream.. \u2013 Daenerys I AGOT</p></blockquote><p>She knows that gifts don\u2019t come without a price. She doesn\u2019t feel entitled to things, and she doesn\u2019t expect people to just give her things because of her name:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;They are your people, and they love you well,&rdquo; Magister Illyrio said amiably. &ldquo;In holdfasts all across the realm, men lift secret toasts to your health while women sew dragon banners and hide them against the day of your return from across the water.&rdquo; He gave a massive shrug. &ldquo;Or so my agents tell me.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Dany had no agents, no way of knowing what anyone was doing or thinking across the narrow sea, but she mistrusted Illyrio&rsquo;s sweet words as she mistrusted everything about Illyrio.</b> \u2013 Daenerys I AGOT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Dany rode close beside him. &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the common people are waiting for him. Magister Illyrio says they are sewing dragon banners and praying for Viserys to return from across the narrow sea to free them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The common people pray for rain, healthy children, and a summer that never ends,&rdquo; Ser Jorah told her. &ldquo;It is no matter to them if the high lords play their game of thrones, so long as they are left in peace.&rdquo; He gave a shrug. &ldquo;They never are.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Dany rode along quietly for a time, working his words like a puzzle box. It went against everything that Viserys had ever told her to think that the people could care so little whether a true king or a usurper reigned over them. Yet the more she thought on Jorah&rsquo;s words, the more they rang of truth.</b> \u2013 Daenerys III AGOT</p><p>&ldquo;Yet I must have some army,&rdquo; Dany said. <b>&ldquo;The boy Joffrey will not give me the Iron Throne for asking politely.&rdquo;</b> \u2013 Daenerys II ASOS</p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, Aegon thinks people will give him things just because he\u2019s the heir to the throne. It doesn\u2019t even crosses his mind that Dany might not be willing to marry him:</p><blockquote><p>\u201c[\u2026] It does make for a splendid story, and the singers will make much of your escape once you take the Iron Throne \u2026 <b>assuming that our fair Daenerys takes you for her consort.&ldquo;</b></p><p><b>&quot;She will. She must.&rdquo;</b></p><p>&ldquo;Must?&rdquo; Tyrion made a tsking sound. &ldquo;That is not a word queens like to hear. You are her perfect prince, agreed, bright and bold and comely as any maid could wish. Daenerys Targaryen is no maid, however. <b>She is the widow of a Dothraki khal, a mother of dragons and sacker of cities, Aegon the Conqueror with teats. She may not prove as willing as you wish.&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be willing.&rdquo; Prince Aegon sounded shocked. It was plain that he had never before considered the possibility that his bride-to-be might refuse him. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know her.&rdquo;</b> He picked up his heavy horse and put it down with a thump.</p><p>The dwarf shrugged. &ldquo;I know that she spent her childhood in exile, impoverished, living on dreams and schemes, running from one city to the next, always fearful, never safe, friendless but for a brother who was by all accounts half-mad \u2026 a brother who sold her maidenhood to the Dothraki for the promise of an army. I know that somewhere out upon the grass her dragons hatched, and so did she. I know she is proud. How not? What else was left her but pride? I know she is strong. How not? The Dothraki despise weakness. If Daenerys had been weak, she would have perished with Viserys. I know she is fierce. Astapor, Yunkai, and Meereen are proof enough of that. She has crossed the grasslands and the red waste, survived assassins and conspiracies and fell sorceries, grieved for a brother and a husband and a son, trod the cities of the slavers to dust beneath her dainty sandaled feet. <b>Now, how do you suppose this queen will react when you turn up with your begging bowl in hand and say, &lsquo;Good morrow to you, Auntie. I am your nephew, Aegon, returned from the dead. I&rsquo;ve been hiding on a poleboat all my life, but now I&rsquo;ve washed the blue dye from my hair and I&rsquo;d like a dragon, please \u2026 and oh, did I mention, my claim to the Iron Throne is stronger than your own?&rsquo; &rdquo;</b></p><p>Aegon&rsquo;s mouth twisted in fury. &ldquo;I will not come to my aunt a beggar. I will come to her a kinsman, with an army.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A small army.&rdquo; There, that&rsquo;s made him good and angry. The dwarf could not help but think of Joffrey. I have a gift for angering princes. &ldquo;Queen Daenerys has a large one, and no thanks to you.&rdquo; Tyrion moved his crossbows. \u2013 Tyrion VI ADWD</p></blockquote><p>And in Tyrion\u2019s speech about Dany, he highlights all the things Dany has already achieved, while Aegon is \u201chalf a boy\u201d.</p><p><b>3)</b> Another difference between them is their views on women. Dany doesn\u2019t think that being a woman makes her lesser:</p><blockquote><p><b>&ldquo;Woman?&rdquo; She chuckled. &ldquo;Is that meant to insult me? I would return the slap, if I took you for a man.&rdquo;</b> \u2013 Daenerys IV ASOS</p></blockquote><p>Aegon, on the other hand, looks down on women:</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; the boy said, <b>&ldquo;and who is there left in Westeros to oppose us? A woman.&rdquo;</b> \u2013 The Lost Lord ADWD</p><p><b>4)</b> Aegon has been groomed to rule:</p><blockquote><p><b>\n\n&ldquo;The boy is bright. You have done well by him. Half the lords in Westeros are not so learned, sad to say. Languages, history, songs, sums \u2026</b> a heady stew for some sellsword&rsquo;s son.&rdquo; - Tyrion IV ADWD<br/></p></blockquote><p>Dany, on the other hand, had to learn and seek knowledge on her own:</p><blockquote><p><b>&ldquo;Tell me of this other Daenerys. I know less than I should of the history of my father&rsquo;s kingdom. I never had a maester growing up.&rdquo;</b> Only a brother. \u2013 Daenerys VIII ADWD</p></blockquote><p>But even though Dany hasn\u2019t been shaped for ruling, she\u2019s the one that has become actually prepared for it. She has dealt with real problems and injustices, has made personal sacrifices for the good of her people, has held court, had to deal with the economy and people with different interests. She had to make hard choices and reflect on them: should she seek peace and let slavery return or is peace not worth it? Should she help sick refugees and risk spreading their disease or should she abandon them? Should she send her army to Astapor and risk losing Meereen or should she abandon Astapor and defend her city? Dany had to make hard choices and deal with the consequences of her actions. Aegon has been groomed, but he\u2019s not truly ready to rule.</p><p><b>5)</b> When we look at what Varys says about Aegon, a good part of it actually describes Dany:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; The eunuch&rsquo;s voice seemed deeper. &ldquo;He is here. Aegon has been shaped for rule since before he could walk. He has been trained in arms, as befits a knight to be, but that was not the end of his education. He reads and writes, he speaks several tongues, he has studied history and law and poetry. A septa has instructed him in the mysteries of the Faith since he was old enough to understand them. He has lived with fisherfolk, worked with his hands, swum in rivers and mended nets and learned to wash his own clothes at need. He can fish and cook and bind up a wound, <b>he knows what it is like to be hungry, to be hunted, to be afraid. </b>Tommen has been taught that kingship is his right. <b>Aegon knows that kingship is his duty, that a king must put his people first, and live and rule for them.&rdquo; </b>\u2013 Epilogue ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Dany is the one who knows what is like to be hungry and afraid, not Aegon. She spent her entire life running from the supposed assassins that Viserys believed were after them, and this is what she feels after the wineseller tries to poison her:</p><blockquote><p>Dany was near tears as they carried her back. The taste in her mouth was one she had known before: fear. For years she had lived in terror of Viserys, afraid of waking the dragon. This was even worse. It was not just for herself that she feared now, but for her baby. \u2013 Daenerys VI AGOT</p></blockquote><p>And we know that she sees queenship as a duty:</p><blockquote><p><b>A queen belongs not to herself but to her people. </b>\u2013 Daenerys V ADWD</p></blockquote><p>For a long time, Dany puts her people first. She stays in Meereen, putting her people before her desire to go to Westeros, and marries Hizdahr for Peace, knowing that this could mean that she would never return to Westeros:</p><blockquote><p><b>And if I never march for Westeros?</b> \u2013 Daenerys IX ADWD</p></blockquote><p><b>6)</b> Tyrion says that Dany is a rescuer:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I told you, I know our little queen. Let her hear that her brother Rhaegar&rsquo;s murdered son is still alive, that this brave boy has raised the dragon standard of her forebears in Westeros once more, that he is fighting a desperate war to avenge his father and reclaim the Iron Throne for House Targaryen, hard-pressed on every side \u2026 and she will fly to your side as fast as wind and water can carry her. You are the last of her line, and this Mother of Dragons, this Breaker of Chains, is above all a rescuer. The girl who drowned the slaver cities in blood rather than leave strangers to their chains can scarcely abandon her own brother&rsquo;s son in his hour of peril. [\u2026]\u201d \u2013 Tyrion VI ADWD</p></blockquote><p>We can\u2019t know for sure if Dany would help Aegon, because she doesn\u2019t know about him yet. But we know for sure that Dany was unable to leave stranger to their chains, and felt responsible to help them. Meanwhile, Aegon did the opposite. When he heard that his father\u2019s sister was hard-pressed on every side and needed his help, he did not go with the Golden Company to help her in her crusade against slavery. He used this as an opportunity to get the upper hand and seize the throne for himself:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I have,&rdquo; the lad insisted. <b>&ldquo;Why should I go running to my aunt as if I were a beggar?

Meanwhile, Dany doesn\u2019t let herself be affected by trivial offenses:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWe are all dead, then. You gave us death, not freedom.\u201d <b>Ghael leapt to his feet and spat into her face.</b></p><p>Strong Belwas seized him by the shoulder and slammed him down onto the marble so hard that Dany heard Ghael&rsquo;s teeth crack.

Strong Belwas was on him at once.

Her only caregiver is a brother who abuses her, and we see how she has experience with the world and it\u2019s woes:</p><blockquote><p><b>After Ser Willem had died, the servants had stolen what little money they had left, and soon after they had been put out of the big house.</b> Dany had cried when the red door closed behind them forever.</p><p><b>They had wandered since then, from Braavos to Myr, from Myr to Tyrosh, and on to Qohor and Volantis and Lys, never staying long in any one place. </b>Her brother would not allow it. The Usurper\u2019s hired knives were close behind them, he insisted, though Dany had never seen one.</p><p>At first the magisters and archons and merchant princes were pleased to welcome the last Targaryens to their homes and tables, but <b>as the years passed and the Usurper continued to sit upon the Iron Throne, doors closed and their lives grew meaner.

While Illyrio gave Aegon candied ginger (and I imagine many other gifts), Dany almost never could get things that she wanted, and for her, it was a big joy when she could indeed buy something:</p><blockquote><p><b>\u201cWhen I was a little girl, I loved to play in the bazaar,\u201d</b> Dany told Ser Jorah as they wandered down the shady aisle between the stalls. \u201cIt was so alive there, all the people shouting and laughing, <b>so many wonderful things to look at \u2026 though we seldom had enough coin to buy anything \u2026 well, except for a sausage now and again, or honeyfingers \u2026</b> do they have honeyfingers in the Seven Kingdoms, the kind they bake in Tyrosh?\u201d \u2013 Daenerys VI AGOT</p></blockquote><p><b>2)</b> Dany seems to have learned from her experience in the streets, unlike Aegon, who was sheltered:</p><blockquote><p><b>\u201cWhy does he give us so much?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat does he want from us?\u201d </b>For nigh on half a year, they had lived in the magister\u2019s house, eating his food, pampered by his servants. <b>Dany was thirteen, old enough to know that such gifts seldom come without their price, here in the free city of Pentos </b>[\u2026]Magister Illyrio was a dealer in spices, gemstones, dragonbone, and other, less savory things. He had friends in all of the Nine Free Cities, it was said, and even beyond, in Vaes Dothrak and the fabled lands beside the Jade Sea. <b>It was also said that he\u2019d never had a friend he wouldn\u2019t cheerfully sell for the right price. Dany listened to the talk in the streets, and she heard these things,</b> but she knew better than to question her brother when he wove his webs of dream.. \u2013 Daenerys I AGOT</p></blockquote><p>She knows that gifts don\u2019t come without a price. She doesn\u2019t feel entitled to things, and she doesn\u2019t expect people to just give her things because of her name:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThey are your people, and they love you well,\u201d Magister Illyrio said amiably. \u201cIn holdfasts all across the realm, men lift secret toasts to your health while women sew dragon banners and hide them against the day of your return from across the water.\u201d He gave a massive shrug. \u201cOr so my agents tell me.\u201d</p><p><b>Dany had no agents, no way of knowing what anyone was doing or thinking across the narrow sea, but she mistrusted Illyrio\u2019s sweet words as she mistrusted everything about Illyrio.</b> \u2013 Daenerys I AGOT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Dany rode close beside him. \u201cStill,\u201d she said, \u201cthe common people are waiting for him. Magister Illyrio says they are sewing dragon banners and praying for Viserys to return from across the narrow sea to free them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe common people pray for rain, healthy children, and a summer that never ends,\u201d Ser Jorah told her. \u201cIt is no matter to them if the high lords play their game of thrones, so long as they are left in peace.\u201d He gave a shrug. \u201cThey never are.\u201d</p><p><b>Dany rode along quietly for a time, working his words like a puzzle box. It went against everything that Viserys had ever told her to think that the people could care so little whether a true king or a usurper reigned over them. Yet the more she thought on Jorah\u2019s words, the more they rang of truth.</b> \u2013 Daenerys III AGOT</p><p>\u201cYet I must have some army,\u201d Dany said. <b>\u201cThe boy Joffrey will not give me the Iron Throne for asking politely.\u201d</b> \u2013 Daenerys II ASOS</p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, Aegon thinks people will give him things just because he\u2019s the heir to the throne. It doesn\u2019t even crosses his mind that Dany might not be willing to marry him:</p><blockquote><p>\u201c[\u2026] It does make for a splendid story, and the singers will make much of your escape once you take the Iron Throne \u2026 <b>assuming that our fair Daenerys takes you for her consort.\u201c</b></p><p><b>\"She will. She must.\u201d</b></p><p>\u201cMust?\u201d Tyrion made a tsking sound. \u201cThat is not a word queens like to hear. You are her perfect prince, agreed, bright and bold and comely as any maid could wish. Daenerys Targaryen is no maid, however. <b>She is the widow of a Dothraki khal, a mother of dragons and sacker of cities, Aegon the Conqueror with teats. She may not prove as willing as you wish.\u201d</b></p><p><b>\u201cShe\u2019ll be willing.\u201d Prince Aegon sounded shocked. It was plain that he had never before considered the possibility that his bride-to-be might refuse him. \u201cYou don\u2019t know her.\u201d</b> He picked up his heavy horse and put it down with a thump.</p><p>The dwarf shrugged. \u201cI know that she spent her childhood in exile, impoverished, living on dreams and schemes, running from one city to the next, always fearful, never safe, friendless but for a brother who was by all accounts half-mad \u2026 a brother who sold her maidenhood to the Dothraki for the promise of an army. I know that somewhere out upon the grass her dragons hatched, and so did she. I know she is proud. How not? What else was left her but pride? I know she is strong. How not? The Dothraki despise weakness. If Daenerys had been weak, she would have perished with Viserys. I know she is fierce. Astapor, Yunkai, and Meereen are proof enough of that. She has crossed the grasslands and the red waste, survived assassins and conspiracies and fell sorceries, grieved for a brother and a husband and a son, trod the cities of the slavers to dust beneath her dainty sandaled feet. <b>Now, how do you suppose this queen will react when you turn up with your begging bowl in hand and say, \u2018Good morrow to you, Auntie. I am your nephew, Aegon, returned from the dead. I\u2019ve been hiding on a poleboat all my life, but now I\u2019ve washed the blue dye from my hair and I\u2019d like a dragon, please \u2026 and oh, did I mention, my claim to the Iron Throne is stronger than your own?\u2019 \u201d</b></p><p>Aegon\u2019s mouth twisted in fury. \u201cI will not come to my aunt a beggar. I will come to her a kinsman, with an army.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA small army.\u201d There, that\u2019s made him good and angry. The dwarf could not help but think of Joffrey. I have a gift for angering princes. \u201cQueen Daenerys has a large one, and no thanks to you.\u201d Tyrion moved his crossbows. \u2013 Tyrion VI ADWD</p></blockquote><p>And in Tyrion\u2019s speech about Dany, he highlights all the things Dany has already achieved, while Aegon is \u201chalf a boy\u201d.</p><p><b>3)</b> Another difference between them is their views on women. Dany doesn\u2019t think that being a woman makes her lesser:</p><blockquote><p><b>\u201cWoman?\u201d She chuckled. \u201cIs that meant to insult me? I would return the slap, if I took you for a man.\u201d</b> \u2013 Daenerys IV ASOS</p></blockquote><p>Aegon, on the other hand, looks down on women:</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so,\u201d the boy said, <b>\u201cand who is there left in Westeros to oppose us? A woman.\u201d</b> \u2013 The Lost Lord ADWD</p><p><b>4)</b> Aegon has been groomed to rule:</p><blockquote><p><b>\n\n\u201cThe boy is bright. You have done well by him. Half the lords in Westeros are not so learned, sad to say. Languages, history, songs, sums \u2026</b> a heady stew for some sellsword\u2019s son.\u201d - Tyrion IV ADWD<br></p></blockquote><p>Dany, on the other hand, had to learn and seek knowledge on her own:</p><blockquote><p><b>\u201cTell me of this other Daenerys. I know less than I should of the history of my father\u2019s kingdom. I never had a maester growing up.\u201d</b> Only a brother. \u2013 Daenerys VIII ADWD</p></blockquote><p>But even though Dany hasn\u2019t been shaped for ruling, she\u2019s the one that has become actually prepared for it. She has dealt with real problems and injustices, has made personal sacrifices for the good of her people, has held court, had to deal with the economy and people with different interests. She had to make hard choices and reflect on them: should she seek peace and let slavery return or is peace not worth it? Should she help sick refugees and risk spreading their disease or should she abandon them? Should she send her army to Astapor and risk losing Meereen or should she abandon Astapor and defend her city? Dany had to make hard choices and deal with the consequences of her actions. Aegon has been groomed, but he\u2019s not truly ready to rule.</p><p><b>5)</b> When we look at what Varys says about Aegon, a good part of it actually describes Dany:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The eunuch\u2019s voice seemed deeper. \u201cHe is here. Aegon has been shaped for rule since before he could walk. He has been trained in arms, as befits a knight to be, but that was not the end of his education. He reads and writes, he speaks several tongues, he has studied history and law and poetry. A septa has instructed him in the mysteries of the Faith since he was old enough to understand them. He has lived with fisherfolk, worked with his hands, swum in rivers and mended nets and learned to wash his own clothes at need. He can fish and cook and bind up a wound, <b>he knows what it is like to be hungry, to be hunted, to be afraid. </b>Tommen has been taught that kingship is his right. <b>Aegon knows that kingship is his duty, that a king must put his people first, and live and rule for them.\u201d </b>\u2013 Epilogue ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Dany is the one who knows what is like to be hungry and afraid, not Aegon. She spent her entire life running from the supposed assassins that Viserys believed were after them, and this is what she feels after the wineseller tries to poison her:</p><blockquote><p>Dany was near tears as they carried her back. The taste in her mouth was one she had known before: fear. For years she had lived in terror of Viserys, afraid of waking the dragon. This was even worse. It was not just for herself that she feared now, but for her baby. \u2013 Daenerys VI AGOT</p></blockquote><p>And we know that she sees queenship as a duty:</p><blockquote><p><b>A queen belongs not to herself but to her people. </b>\u2013 Daenerys V ADWD</p></blockquote><p>For a long time, Dany puts her people first. She stays in Meereen, putting her people before her desire to go to Westeros, and marries Hizdahr for Peace, knowing that this could mean that she would never return to Westeros:</p><blockquote><p><b>And if I never march for Westeros?</b> \u2013 Daenerys IX ADWD</p></blockquote><p><b>6)</b> Tyrion says that Dany is a rescuer:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI told you, I know our little queen. Let her hear that her brother Rhaegar\u2019s murdered son is still alive, that this brave boy has raised the dragon standard of her forebears in Westeros once more, that he is fighting a desperate war to avenge his father and reclaim the Iron Throne for House Targaryen, hard-pressed on every side \u2026 and she will fly to your side as fast as wind and water can carry her. You are the last of her line, and this Mother of Dragons, this Breaker of Chains, is above all a rescuer. The girl who drowned the slaver cities in blood rather than leave strangers to their chains can scarcely abandon her own brother\u2019s son in his hour of peril. [\u2026]\u201d \u2013 Tyrion VI ADWD</p></blockquote><p>We can\u2019t know for sure if Dany would help Aegon, because she doesn\u2019t know about him yet. But we know for sure that Dany was unable to leave stranger to their chains, and felt responsible to help them. Meanwhile, Aegon did the opposite. When he heard that his father\u2019s sister was hard-pressed on every side and needed his help, he did not go with the Golden Company to help her in her crusade against slavery. He used this as an opportunity to get the upper hand and seize the throne for himself:</p><blockquote><p>\"I have,\u201d the lad insisted. <b>\u201cWhy should I go running to my aunt as if I were a beggar? My claim is better than her own. Let her come to me \u2026 in Westeros.\u201d</b></p><p>[\u2026]</p><p><b>\u201cIf my aunt wants Meereen, she\u2019s welcome to it. I will claim the Iron Throne by myself</b>, with your swords and your allegiance. [\u2026]\u201d \u2013 The Lost Lord ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Dany spends the entirety of ADWD putting her own wishes aside because she believes that the peace is the best way.

He had friends in all of the Nine Free Cities, it was said, and even beyond, in Vaes Dothrak and the fabled lands beside the Jade Sea. <b>It was also said that he\u2019d never had a friend he wouldn\u2019t cheerfully sell for the right price. Dany listened to the talk in the streets, and she heard these things,</b> but she knew better than to question her brother when he wove his webs of dream.. \u2013 Daenerys I AGOT</p></blockquote><p>She knows that gifts don\u2019t come without a price. She doesn\u2019t feel entitled to things, and she doesn\u2019t expect people to just give her things because of her name:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThey are your people, and they love you well,\u201d Magister Illyrio said amiably. \u201cIn holdfasts all across the realm, men lift secret toasts to your health while women sew dragon banners and hide them against the day of your return from across the water.\u201d He gave a massive shrug. \u201cOr so my agents tell me.\u201d</p><p><b>Dany had no agents, no way of knowing what anyone was doing or thinking across the narrow sea, but she mistrusted Illyrio\u2019s sweet words as she mistrusted everything about Illyrio.</b> \u2013 Daenerys I AGOT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Dany rode close beside him. \u201cStill,\u201d she said, \u201cthe common people are waiting for him.

It went against everything that Viserys had ever told her to think that the people could care so little whether a true king or a usurper reigned over them. Yet the more she thought on Jorah\u2019s words, the more they rang of truth.</b> \u2013 Daenerys III AGOT</p><p>\u201cYet I must have some army,\u201d Dany said. <b>\u201cThe boy Joffrey will not give me the Iron Throne for asking politely.\u201d</b> \u2013 Daenerys II ASOS</p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, Aegon thinks people will give him things just because he\u2019s the heir to the throne. It doesn\u2019t even crosses his mind that Dany might not be willing to marry him:</p><blockquote><p>\u201c[\u2026] It does make for a splendid story, and the singers will make much of your escape once you take the Iron Throne \u2026 <b>assuming that our fair Daenerys takes you for her consort.\u201c</b></p><p><b>\"She will.

You are her perfect prince, agreed, bright and bold and comely as any maid could wish. Daenerys Targaryen is no maid, however. <b>She is the widow of a Dothraki khal, a mother of dragons and sacker of cities, Aegon the Conqueror with teats. She may not prove as willing as you wish.\u201d</b></p><p><b>\u201cShe\u2019ll be willing.\u201d Prince Aegon sounded shocked. It was plain that he had never before considered the possibility that his bride-to-be might refuse him. \u201cYou don\u2019t know her.\u201d</b> He picked up his heavy horse and put it down with a thump.</p><p>The dwarf shrugged. \u201cI know that she spent her childhood in exile, impoverished, living on dreams and schemes, running from one city to the next, always fearful, never safe, friendless but for a brother who was by all accounts half-mad \u2026 a brother who sold her maidenhood to the Dothraki for the promise of an army. I know that somewhere out upon the grass her dragons hatched, and so did she. I know she is proud. How not? What else was left her but pride? I know she is strong. How not? The Dothraki despise weakness. If Daenerys had been weak, she would have perished with Viserys. I know she is fierce. Astapor, Yunkai, and Meereen are proof enough of that. She has crossed the grasslands and the red waste, survived assassins and conspiracies and fell sorceries, grieved for a brother and a husband and a son, trod the cities of the slavers to dust beneath her dainty sandaled feet. <b>Now, how do you suppose this queen will react when you turn up with your begging bowl in hand and say, \u2018Good morrow to you, Auntie. I am your nephew, Aegon, returned from the dead. I\u2019ve been hiding on a poleboat all my life, but now I\u2019ve washed the blue dye from my hair and I\u2019d like a dragon, please \u2026 and oh, did I mention, my claim to the Iron Throne is stronger than your own?\u2019 \u201d</b></p><p>Aegon\u2019s mouth twisted in fury. \u201cI will not come to my aunt a beggar.

I have a gift for angering princes. \u201cQueen Daenerys has a large one, and no thanks to you.\u201d Tyrion moved his crossbows. \u2013 Tyrion VI ADWD</p></blockquote><p>And in Tyrion\u2019s speech about Dany, he highlights all the things Dany has already achieved, while Aegon is \u201chalf a boy\u201d.</p><p><b>3)</b> Another difference between them is their views on women. Dany doesn\u2019t think that being a woman makes her lesser:</p><blockquote><p><b>\u201cWoman?\u201d She chuckled. \u201cIs that meant to insult me? I would return the slap, if I took you for a man.\u201d</b> \u2013 Daenerys IV ASOS</p></blockquote><p>Aegon, on the other hand, looks down on women:</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so,\u201d the boy said, <b>\u201cand who is there left in Westeros to oppose us? A woman.\u201d</b> \u2013 The Lost Lord ADWD</p><p><b>4)</b> Aegon has been groomed to rule:</p><blockquote><p><b>\n\n\u201cThe boy is bright. You have done well by him. Half the lords in Westeros are not so learned, sad to say. Languages, history, songs, sums \u2026</b> a heady stew for some sellsword\u2019s son.\u201d - Tyrion IV ADWD<br></p></blockquote><p>Dany, on the other hand, had to learn and seek knowledge on her own:</p><blockquote><p><b>\u201cTell me of this other Daenerys. I know less than I should of the history of my father\u2019s kingdom. I never had a maester growing up.\u201d</b> Only a brother. \u2013 Daenerys VIII ADWD</p></blockquote><p>But even though Dany hasn\u2019t been shaped for ruling, she\u2019s the one that has become actually prepared for it. She has dealt with real problems and injustices, has made personal sacrifices for the good of her people, has held court, had to deal with the economy and people with different interests. She had to make hard choices and reflect on them: should she seek peace and let slavery return or is peace not worth it? Should she help sick refugees and risk spreading their disease or should she abandon them? Should she send her army to Astapor and risk losing Meereen or should she abandon Astapor and defend her city? Dany had to make hard choices and deal with the consequences of her actions. Aegon has been groomed, but he\u2019s not truly ready to rule.</p><p><b>5)</b> When we look at what Varys says about Aegon, a good part of it actually describes Dany:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The eunuch\u2019s voice seemed deeper. \u201cHe is here. Aegon has been shaped for rule since before he could walk. He has been trained in arms, as befits a knight to be, but that was not the end of his education. He reads and writes, he speaks several tongues, he has studied history and law and poetry. A septa has instructed him in the mysteries of the Faith since he was old enough to understand them. He has lived with fisherfolk, worked with his hands, swum in rivers and mended nets and learned to wash his own clothes at need. He can fish and cook and bind up a wound, <b>he knows what it is like to be hungry, to be hunted, to be afraid. </b>Tommen has been taught that kingship is his right. <b>Aegon knows that kingship is his duty, that a king must put his people first, and live and rule for them.\u201d </b>\u2013 Epilogue ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Dany is the one who knows what is like to be hungry and afraid, not Aegon. She spent her entire life running from the supposed assassins that Viserys believed were after them, and this is what she feels after the wineseller tries to poison her:</p><blockquote><p>Dany was near tears as they carried her back. The taste in her mouth was one she had known before: fear. For years she had lived in terror of Viserys, afraid of waking the dragon. This was even worse. It was not just for herself that she feared now, but for her baby. \u2013 Daenerys VI AGOT</p></blockquote><p>And we know that she sees queenship as a duty:</p><blockquote><p><b>A queen belongs not to herself but to her people. </b>\u2013 Daenerys V ADWD</p></blockquote><p>For a long time, Dany puts her people first. She stays in Meereen, putting her people before her desire to go to Westeros, and marries Hizdahr for Peace, knowing that this could mean that she would never return to Westeros:</p><blockquote><p><b>And if I never march for Westeros?</b> \u2013 Daenerys IX ADWD</p></blockquote><p><b>6)</b> Tyrion says that Dany is a rescuer:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI told you, I know our little queen. Let her hear that her brother Rhaegar\u2019s murdered son is still alive, that this brave boy has raised the dragon standard of her forebears in Westeros once more, that he is fighting a desperate war to avenge his father and reclaim the Iron Throne for House Targaryen, hard-pressed on every side \u2026 and she will fly to your side as fast as wind and water can carry her. You are the last of her line, and this Mother of Dragons, this Breaker of Chains, is above all a rescuer. The girl who drowned the slaver cities in blood rather than leave strangers to their chains can scarcely abandon her own brother\u2019s son in his hour of peril. [\u2026]\u201d \u2013 Tyrion VI ADWD</p></blockquote><p>We can\u2019t know for sure if Dany would help Aegon, because she doesn\u2019t know about him yet. But we know for sure that Dany was unable to leave stranger to their chains, and felt responsible to help them. Meanwhile, Aegon did the opposite. When he heard that his father\u2019s sister was hard-pressed on every side and needed his help, he did not go with the Golden Company to help her in her crusade against slavery. He used this as an opportunity to get the upper hand and seize the throne for himself:</p><blockquote><p>\"I have,\u201d the lad insisted. <b>\u201cWhy should I go running to my aunt as if I were a beggar? My claim is better than her own. Let her come to me \u2026 in Westeros.\u201d</b></p><p>[\u2026]</p><p><b>\u201cIf my aunt wants Meereen, she\u2019s welcome to it. I will claim the Iron Throne by myself</b>, with your swords and your allegiance. [\u2026]\u201d \u2013 The Lost Lord ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Dany spends the entirety of ADWD putting her own wishes aside because she believes that the peace is the best way. But in his first opportunity, Aegon gives up on any idea of peace. Not only he doesn\u2019t help Dany, but he disregards the fact that taking the throne without Dany might lead to a war against her.</p><p><b>7) </b>Varys clearly expected that Aegon\u2019s humble life would also make him a humble person. But it didn\u2019t seem to have worked. When Tyrion defeats him in cyvasse, this is his reaction:</p><blockquote><p><b>Young Griff jerked to his feet and kicked over the board.</b> Cyvasse pieces flew in all directions, bouncing and rolling across the deck of the Shy Maid. <b>\"Pick those up,\u201d the boy commanded. </b>\u2013 Tyrion VI ADWD</p></blockquote><p>He has a very immature reaction and seeks to humiliate Tyrion in retribution. Meanwhile, Dany doesn\u2019t let herself be affected by trivial offenses:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWe are all dead, then. You gave us death, not freedom.\u201d <b>Ghael leapt to his feet and spat into her face.</b></p><p>Strong Belwas seized him by the shoulder and slammed him down onto the marble so hard that Dany heard Ghael\u2019s teeth crack. The Shavepate would have done worse, but she stopped him.</p><p><b>\u201cEnough,\u201d she said, dabbing at her cheek with the end of her tokar. \u201cNo one has ever died from spittle. Take him away.\u201d </b>\u2013 Daenerys III ADWD</p></blockquote><p>And she not only forgives people that spit on her, but also people that try to attack her:</p><blockquote><p><b>When she told him, the boy rushed at her,</b> but his feet tangled in his tokar and he went sprawling headlong on the purple marble. Strong Belwas was on him at once. The huge brown eunuch yanked him up one-handed and shook him like a mastiff with a rat. <b>\u201cEnough, Belwas,\u201d Dany called. \u201cRelease him.\u201d To the boy she said, \u201cTreasure that tokar, for it saved your life. You are only a boy, so we will forget what happened here. You should do the same.\u201d </b>\u2013 Daenerys I ADWD</p></blockquote><p><b>8) </b>Aegon has been a pawn his entire life, living a narrative that others created for him and being deceived. Dany started her life as a pawn, but has broken free and is making her own destiny.</p><p>I think all of these differences between Dany and Aegon are really interesting, because Aegon was created to usurp Dany storyline, but it all feels hollow. Varys expected that by molding Aegon\u2019s life, he could create a specific kind of person. But it\u2019s not guaranteed, and without facing real trials, he can never be the good king that Varys expects him to be.</p>",
                "content": "<p>Much has been said about how Aegon is a deconstruction of hero tropes and how his story is supposed to feel cheap and unearned. And I think what highlights this the most is just how different Dany and Aegon are.</p><p><b>1)</b> Aegon has been sheltered his entire life. This is what Tyrion remarks of him:</p><blockquote><p>The lad did not seem appeased. <b>The perfect prince but still half a boy for all that, with little and less experience of the world and all its woes.</b> &ndash; Tyrion VI ADWD</p></blockquote><p>He grew up with a father figure (Jon Connington), and we know how Illyrio pampered him:</p><blockquote><p><b>&ldquo;There is a gift for the boy in one of the chests. Some candied ginger. He was always fond of it.&rdquo;</b> Illyrio sounded oddly sad. &ndash; Tyrion III ADWD</p></blockquote><p>In Dany&rsquo;s first chapter, we see how her life has been the opposite. Her only caregiver is a brother who abuses her, and we see how she has experience with the world and it&rsquo;s woes:</p><blockquote><p><b>After Ser Willem had died, the servants had stolen what little money they had left, and soon after they had been put out of the big house.</b> Dany had cried when the red door closed behind them forever.</p><p><b>They had wandered since then, from Braavos to Myr, from Myr to Tyrosh, and on to Qohor and Volantis and Lys, never staying long in any one place. </b>Her brother would not allow it. The Usurper&rsquo;s hired knives were close behind them, he insisted, though Dany had never seen one.</p><p>At first the magisters and archons and merchant princes were pleased to welcome the last Targaryens to their homes and tables, but <b>as the years passed and the Usurper continued to sit upon the Iron Throne, doors closed and their lives grew meaner. Years past they had been forced to sell their last few treasures, and now even the coin they had gotten from Mother&rsquo;s crown had gone.</b> In the alleys and wine sinks of Pentos, they called her brother &ldquo;the beggar king.&rdquo; Dany did not want to know what they called her. &ndash; Daenerys I AGOT</p></blockquote><p>She was not pampered. While Illyrio gave Aegon candied ginger (and I imagine many other gifts), Dany almost never could get things that she wanted, and for her, it was a big joy when she could indeed buy something:</p><blockquote><p><b>&ldquo;When I was a little girl, I loved to play in the bazaar,&rdquo;</b> Dany told Ser Jorah as they wandered down the shady aisle between the stalls. &ldquo;It was so alive there, all the people shouting and laughing, <b>so many wonderful things to look at &hellip; though we seldom had enough coin to buy anything &hellip; well, except for a sausage now and again, or honeyfingers &hellip;</b> do they have honeyfingers in the Seven Kingdoms, the kind they bake in Tyrosh?&rdquo; &ndash; Daenerys VI AGOT</p></blockquote><p><b>2)</b> Dany seems to have learned from her experience in the streets, unlike Aegon, who was sheltered:</p><blockquote><p><b>&ldquo;Why does he give us so much?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;What does he want from us?&rdquo; </b>For nigh on half a year, they had lived in the magister&rsquo;s house, eating his food, pampered by his servants. <b>Dany was thirteen, old enough to know that such gifts seldom come without their price, here in the free city of Pentos </b>[&hellip;]Magister Illyrio was a dealer in spices, gemstones, dragonbone, and other, less savory things.

[&hellip;]&rdquo; &ndash; Tyrion VI ADWD</p></blockquote><p>We can&rsquo;t know for sure if Dany would help Aegon, because she doesn&rsquo;t know about him yet. But we know for sure that Dany was unable to leave stranger to their chains, and felt responsible to help them. Meanwhile, Aegon did the opposite. When he heard that his father&rsquo;s sister was hard-pressed on every side and needed his help, he did not go with the Golden Company to help her in her crusade against slavery. He used this as an opportunity to get the upper hand and seize the throne for himself:</p><blockquote><p>\"I have,&rdquo; the lad insisted. <b>&ldquo;Why should I go running to my aunt as if I were a beggar? My claim is better than her own. Let her come to me &hellip; in Westeros.&rdquo;</b></p><p>[&hellip;]</p><p><b>&ldquo;If my aunt wants Meereen, she&rsquo;s welcome to it. I will claim the Iron Throne by myself</b>, with your swords and your allegiance. [&hellip;]&rdquo; &ndash; The Lost Lord ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Dany spends the entirety of ADWD putting her own wishes aside because she believes that the peace is the best way. But in his first opportunity, Aegon gives up on any idea of peace. Not only he doesn&rsquo;t help Dany, but he disregards the fact that taking the throne without Dany might lead to a war against her.</p><p><b>7) </b>Varys clearly expected that Aegon&rsquo;s humble life would also make him a humble person. But it didn&rsquo;t seem to have worked. When Tyrion defeats him in cyvasse, this is his reaction:</p><blockquote><p><b>Young Griff jerked to his feet and kicked over the board.</b> Cyvasse pieces flew in all directions, bouncing and rolling across the deck of the Shy Maid. <b>\"Pick those up,&rdquo; the boy commanded. </b>&ndash; Tyrion VI ADWD</p></blockquote><p>He has a very immature reaction and seeks to humiliate Tyrion in retribution. Meanwhile, Dany doesn&rsquo;t let herself be affected by trivial offenses:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;We are all dead, then. You gave us death, not freedom.&rdquo; <b>Ghael leapt to his feet and spat into her face.</b></p><p>Strong Belwas seized him by the shoulder and slammed him down onto the marble so hard that Dany heard Ghael&rsquo;s teeth crack. The Shavepate would have done worse, but she stopped him.</p><p><b>&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; she said, dabbing at her cheek with the end of her tokar. &ldquo;No one has ever died from spittle. Take him away.&rdquo; </b>&ndash; Daenerys III ADWD</p></blockquote><p>And she not only forgives people that spit on her, but also people that try to attack her:</p><blockquote><p><b>When she told him, the boy rushed at her,</b> but his feet tangled in his tokar and he went sprawling headlong on the purple marble. Strong Belwas was on him at once. The huge brown eunuch yanked him up one-handed and shook him like a mastiff with a rat. <b>&ldquo;Enough, Belwas,&rdquo; Dany called. &ldquo;Release him.&rdquo; To the boy she said, &ldquo;Treasure that tokar, for it saved your life. You are only a boy, so we will forget what happened here. You should do the same.&rdquo; </b>&ndash; Daenerys I ADWD</p></blockquote><p><b>8) </b>Aegon has been a pawn his entire life, living a narrative that others created for him and being deceived. Dany started her life as a pawn, but has broken free and is making her own destiny.</p><p>I think all of these differences between Dany and Aegon are really interesting, because Aegon was created to usurp Dany storyline, but it all feels hollow. Varys expected that by molding Aegon&rsquo;s life, he could create a specific kind of person. But it&rsquo;s not guaranteed, and without facing real trials, he can never be the good king that Varys expects him to be.</p>",

How\nconvenient is that? </p><p>I\u2019ll start by pointing out the obvious here: from the\nmoment Dany set foot in Astapor, she was going to do \u201cwrong\u201d, one way or\nanother; either by doing what she did, by doing something else, or by doing\nnothing at all. There was no way for her to come out of this <i>unsullied</i>. No. Way. </p><p><i>Dany climbed into her litter frowning, and beckoned Arstan to climb in\nbeside her. </i>A man as old as him should not be walking in such\nheat.<i> She did not close the curtains as\nthey got under way. With the sun beating down so fiercely on this city of red\nbrick, every stray breeze was to be cherished, even if it did come with a swirl\nof fine red dust. </i><b>Besides, I need to see<i>.</i></b></p><p><i> Astapor was a queer city, even to\nthe eyes of one who had walked within the House of Dust and bathed in the Womb\nof the World beneath the Mother of Mountains. All the streets were made of the\nsame red brick that had paved the plaza. So too were the stepped pyramids, the\ndeep-dug fighting pits with their rings of descending seats, the sulfurous\nfountains and gloomy wine caves, and the ancient walls that encircled them. So\nmany bricks, she thought, and so old and crumbling. Their fine red dust was\neverywhere, dancing down the gutters at each gust of wind.<b> Small wonder so many Astapori women veiled their faces; the brick dust\nstung the eyes worse than sand</b>.</i> \u2013 Daenerys, ASOS</p><p>Dany refuses to veil herself to the horrors of the\ncity. She makes herself watch, really watch. And she <i>especially </i>doesn\u2019t \u201cmake\u201d herself feel indignant over what she sees\njust to give herself a justification for tricking Kraznys mo Nakloz. The heat,\nthe dust, the smells, the <i>tap, tap, tap </i>of\nArstan\u2019s cane, it all means <i>nagging.\nPersistent. Intolerable.</i> Dany doesn\u2019t need to seek outrage. What she sees literally\ngnaws at her. What are her options, here? In broad strokes, she\u2019s got three:\nleaving with empty hands, pulling the trick she pulled, or honoring the deal\nmade with Kraznys (assuming that Drogon doesn\u2019t go berserk on his own). Each of\nthem is morally problematic: if she leaves without doing anything, she leaves\nintact a problem that <i>we know </i>would\u2019ve\nbeen in her power to fix. I\u2019m not talking about the aftermath, here: sure, that\ncould\u2019ve been dealt with more sensibly, but regardless of what Dany did with\nAstapor after, regardless of what she should\u2019ve done after, what she did at\nfirst, what started it all, was arguably \u2013 dare I say \u2013 necessary. Any\nprocedure foreseeing results in the longer term (what Tyrion tried to pull off\nwith the slavers in season six, for instance) wasn\u2019t going to save the thousand\nof infants, unsullieds in training and little boys thrown into bear pits who\nneeded saving <i>right now.</i> Children\nrolled in honey, blood or rotten fish and given to bears don\u2019t care about what\nthe policies will look like in seven years. If Dany decides to \u201csave\u201d them by\nbuying them, mo Nakloz and his clique will simply replace them with others. </p><p>And that\u2019s also the problem, should Dany have bought\nher unsullieds \u201chonestly\u201d (not to mention, the implications of handing a dragon\nto slavers.) So she gets an army for free, say antis, how convenient is that? Well,\nlet\u2019s look at Dany\u2019s feelings on the matter of\u2026 convenience: </p><p><i>Dany had eaten dog in other places, at other times, but just now <b>all she could think of was the Unsullied\nand their stupid puppies</b>. She swept past the huge eunuch and up the plank\nonto the deck of Balerion.</i></p><p><i> Ser Jorah Mormont stood waiting\nfor her. &ldquo;Your Grace,&rdquo; he said, bowing his head. &ldquo;The slavers\nhave come and gone. Three of them, with a dozen scribes and as many slaves to\nlift and fetch. They crawled over every foot of our holds and made note of all\nwe had.&rdquo; He walked her aft. &ldquo;How many men do they have for\nsale?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;None.&rdquo; <b>Was it Mormont\nshe was angry with, or this city with its sullen heat, its stinks and sweats\nand crumbling bricks? &ldquo;They sell eunuchs, not men. Eunuchs made of brick,\nlike the rest of Astapor. <a>Shall I buy eight thousand\nbrick eunuchs with dead eyes that never move, who kill suckling babes for the\nsake of a spiked hat and strangle their own dogs? </a>They don&rsquo;t even have\nnames.

Groleo\nwatched them from the forecastle, and his crew was watching too. Whitebeard,\nher bloodriders, Jhiqui, every one had stopped what they were doing at the\nsound of the slap. <b>&ldquo;I want to sail\nnow, not on the tide, I want to sail far and fast and never look back. But I\ncan&rsquo;t, can I? There are eight thousand brick eunuchs for sale, and I must find\nsome way to buy them.&rdquo;</b> And with that she left him, and went below.</i> \u2013 Daenerys,\nASOS</p><p>I can\u2019t press enough on what her last sentence means. <i>I want but I can\u2019t. </i>Is Dany thinking of\nWesteros here? Is she thinking of all the lands an army of unsullieds could win\nback for her? <b><i>Shall I buy eight thousand brick eunuchs with dead eyes that never\nmove, who kill suckling babes for the sake of a spiked hat and strangle their\nown dogs?</i></b> She doesn\u2019t want them. She\u2019s disgusted by them. She\u2019s angry at\nser Jorah for putting her in a situation where she has no choice <i>but </i>to act. </p><p>And so, she acts. And gain something out of it, as\nantis never fail to remind us. Yet they brush over the fact that so far, in the\nbooks, the unsullieds aren\u2019t in Westeros, winning lands for Dany. They brush\nover the fact that Dany, despite needing ships as much as soldiers to retake\nWesteros, dismantled her ships to build a ram, take Meereen and feed people who\nwouldn\u2019t be of any use to her in Westeros. They brush over the fact that she had\nanother opportunity to plunder a city in ADWD, but refused to do so, even if it\neffectively cornered her. They brush over so many, many, many facts just so\nthey can pretend that Dany\u2019s good deeds always profit herself. </p>",

The most fetishized episode by\nDany antis and their indubitable proof that Dany only does good deeds when\nthose deed profit her. She got an army for her trouble, for free! How\nconvenient is that? </p><p>I\u2019ll start by pointing out the obvious here: from the\nmoment Dany set foot in Astapor, she was going to do \u201cwrong\u201d, one way or\nanother; either by doing what she did, by doing something else, or by doing\nnothing at all. There was no way for her to come out of this <i>unsullied</i>. No. Way. </p><p><i>Dany climbed into her litter frowning, and beckoned Arstan to climb in\nbeside her. </i>A man as old as him should not be walking in such\nheat.<i> She did not close the curtains as\nthey got under way. With the sun beating down so fiercely on this city of red\nbrick, every stray breeze was to be cherished, even if it did come with a swirl\nof fine red dust. </i><b>Besides, I need to see<i>.</i></b></p><p><i> Astapor was a queer city, even to\nthe eyes of one who had walked within the House of Dust and bathed in the Womb\nof the World beneath the Mother of Mountains. All the streets were made of the\nsame red brick that had paved the plaza. So too were the stepped pyramids, the\ndeep-dug fighting pits with their rings of descending seats, the sulfurous\nfountains and gloomy wine caves, and the ancient walls that encircled them. So\nmany bricks, she thought, and so old and crumbling. Their fine red dust was\neverywhere, dancing down the gutters at each gust of wind.<b> Small wonder so many Astapori women veiled their faces; the brick dust\nstung the eyes worse than sand</b>.</i> \u2013 Daenerys, ASOS</p><p>Dany refuses to veil herself to the horrors of the\ncity. She makes herself watch, really watch. And she <i>especially </i>doesn\u2019t \u201cmake\u201d herself feel indignant over what she sees\njust to give herself a justification for tricking Kraznys mo Nakloz. The heat,\nthe dust, the smells, the <i>tap, tap, tap </i>of\nArstan\u2019s cane, it all means <i>nagging.\nPersistent. Intolerable.</i> Dany doesn\u2019t need to seek outrage. What she sees literally\ngnaws at her. What are her options, here? In broad strokes, she\u2019s got three:\nleaving with empty hands, pulling the trick she pulled, or honoring the deal\nmade with Kraznys (assuming that Drogon doesn\u2019t go berserk on his own). Each of\nthem is morally problematic: if she leaves without doing anything, she leaves\nintact a problem that <i>we know </i>would\u2019ve\nbeen in her power to fix. I\u2019m not talking about the aftermath, here: sure, that\ncould\u2019ve been dealt with more sensibly, but regardless of what Dany did with\nAstapor after, regardless of what she should\u2019ve done after, what she did at\nfirst, what started it all, was arguably \u2013 dare I say \u2013 necessary. Any\nprocedure foreseeing results in the longer term (what Tyrion tried to pull off\nwith the slavers in season six, for instance) wasn\u2019t going to save the thousand\nof infants, unsullieds in training and little boys thrown into bear pits who\nneeded saving <i>right now.</i> Children\nrolled in honey, blood or rotten fish and given to bears don\u2019t care about what\nthe policies will look like in seven years. If Dany decides to \u201csave\u201d them by\nbuying them, mo Nakloz and his clique will simply replace them with others. </p><p>And that\u2019s also the problem, should Dany have bought\nher unsullieds \u201chonestly\u201d (not to mention, the implications of handing a dragon\nto slavers.) So she gets an army for free, say antis, how convenient is that? Well,\nlet\u2019s look at Dany\u2019s feelings on the matter of\u2026 convenience: </p><p><i>Dany had eaten dog in other places, at other times, but just now <b>all she could think of was the Unsullied\nand their stupid puppies</b>.
