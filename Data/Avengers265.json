You eyed Tony with suspicion, trying to figure out his plan.</p><p>\u201cAs a bait?\u201d You asked, barely audible, you already knew what the answer was.</p><p>Steve walked towards your cell door and unlocked it. It opened, but you didn\u2019t move. </p><p>If your Creators find out you\u2019ve been providing information to The Avengers, who knows what they\u2019ll do to you. And as soon as you leave the building, you will also be leaving the protection it offers.</p><p>\u201cKid, lets go,\u201d Steve called.</p><p>You looked away from your hands and turned your attention to the people standing in front of you. You noticed Sam Wilson was there, his arm was still bandaged from when you burned it the other day. And you felt bad, for the first time ever.</p><p>Three days felt like three years in that cell, aside from the same stone faced lady who delivered you food three times a day, no one had visited you, not even Steve. And for some reason you were disappointed, even though you knew there was no reason for him, or anyone, to care about you.</p><p>You were used to cells, cages, and what not. But back in the HYDRA facility, they always give you something to do. Whether it\u2019ll be executing prisoners or more tests and tortures \u2013it was not fun, but it kept your mind occupied. Here, they don\u2019t do that.</p><p>Those three days really gave you the time to think. More than you liked. You thought about all the people you\u2019ve murdered without mercy, all the blood, all the life that fell in your hands. Something that never really crossed your mind before. </p><p>You thought, maybe this was your time to make up to all you\u2019ve done. Deep inside you know there\u2019s still a little bit of mercy and humanity within you, but you\u2019re starting to lose it. And maybe this was your time to bring it back to the surface. Or was it too late?</p><p>You took a deep breath and made up your mind. You got up from your bed and walked towards the door where Steve had been standing. He walked away from you towards the group and you followed. </p><p>\u201cAs soon as you get in touch with your people, you come to us, understood?\u201d Tony stuck something on your arm, making you flinch away from the sudden touch. \u201cGPS tracker, just in case.\u201d</p><p>You glared at him but didn\u2019t fight.</p><p>\u201cYour job is simple, you get out there, find your Creators, find out where Barnes is, and leave the rest to us.\u201d He continued.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re sure we can trust her?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cWe get you\u2019re still upset you were beaten up by a sixteen year old kid, Bird Man, but you need to get over it.\u201d Tony teased.</p><p>Steve, Tony, and Wanda then walked with you to the helipad of the HQ and it didn\u2019t take long until you landed in the middle of the busy city of New York. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna take off this collar, but you will not attack us, okay?\u201d Steve said sternly.</p><p>You nodded ever so slightly. He reached behind you and you heard a beep as he pressed a number in. The others tensed as Steve unwrapped the metal from your neck. You brought your arms up as you watched them glow red for the first time in days.</p><p>\u201cSnap out of it, kid.\u201d Tony warned. He then gave you a little black box with a screen on it, \u201cThat\u2019s called a pager, when you find Barnes press that button-\u201c he pointed, \u201cand we\u2019ll take it from there.\u201d</p><p>And just like that you were ushered out of the chopper and they flew away, leaving you alone. After roaming around the neighborhood mindlessly for a couple of hours, you decided to actually get to work and go visit your base.</p><p>You knew no one would be there by the time you arrive. Hell, they could be half way across the globe for all you know. They wouldn\u2019t hesitate to ditch you for the last Winter Soldier and you knew that. But you also knew they wouldn\u2019t let you go alive, especially if they&rsquo;ve found out that you\u2019ve snitched.</p><p>You opened the door to the building that you\u2019ve called your &ldquo;home&rdquo; for the past year. You roamed around, finding absolutely nothing. Your Creators had left and took everything with them.</p><p>Then you noticed a buzzing sound from the wide backyard of the warehouse. There you saw a pilotless drone hovering just above the ground, a drone you\u2019ve became all too familiar with. It used to be one of HYDRA\u2019s, except now the HYDRA logo was gone, leaving the machine plain jet black colored.</p><p>The door of the plane opened as you step out to the yard towards it. You inhaled deeply before finally boarding the aircraft.</p><p>You flew for hours and hours. It was already dark by the time you landed on a foreign field in the middle of nowhere. The drone opened in front of an abandoned warehouse, you stepped out of it and led yourself in to the building.</p><p>\u201cGreat to have you back,\u201d Stanislav greeted, emotionless. \u201cCome, follow me.\u201d</p><p>You did what you were told and followed the man up a staircase and in to a room. You saw another man strapped to a chair, the chair of your nightmares. He was panting, blood and sweat glistened over his muscled body. Near him stood Tatyana in her signature lab coat.</p><p>Stanislav walked past you to his co-worker and announced your arrival. He then guided her to exit the room while engaging in a conversation. You took this opportunity to press the button on the device Tony had given you. Then you slip the pager under the chair The Winter Soldier was sat on.</p><p>He looked up to you, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cYou shall not worry now,\u201d you said in Russian. \u201cYour friends are coming.\u201d</p><p>Before he could respond, your Creators entered back to the room.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to excuse me for a while, Barnes.\u201d Tatyana said. \u201cSeems like you\u2019re not the only one who needs to be taught a lesson.\u201d</p><p>Panic filled your eyes as you felt the all too familiar metal wrap around your neck. Stanislav grabbed you by your arms and dragged you out as you trashed, but he was much stronger than you as you were once again stripped out of your powers. Tatyana followed closely and before you lost sight of The Winter Soldier, you caught him tensing up in his seat watching them take you with worry in his eyes.</p><p>You were taken to a room right across and almost immediately Stanislav tied you up in between two poles with a chain. You struggled to break free unsuccessfully as he also wrap the chain around your legs, forcing you to sprawl like a starfish.</p><p>\u201cI heard about what you\u2019ve been up to lately, soldier.\u201d He circled around you like a lion eyeing his prey. \u201cWe expected better from you.\u201d</p><p>You can hear your heart thumping against your chest faster than usual. Stanislav returned in front of you and eyed you with hunger for blood.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d He referred to the jacket Steve had given to you to help you hide your arms in public. \u201cYou\u2019re hiding now. You\u2019re turning in to one of the weak.\u201d He ripped the jacket off of your body, exposing your toned abdomen.</p><p>Tatyana walked in to view pushing in an iron cart and you shuddered at the sight of it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to hide who you are. Are you that desperate for acknowledgement? To feel like a human?\u201d He continued, stressing on the word \u2018human\u2019 with such disgust. \u201cOh dear, you never were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the moment you were born, you were never meant to be human.\u201d Tatyana agreed. \u201cYou are destined to be ours, our soldier, our executioner.\u201d</p><p>Stanislav walked to the iron cart and picked up a sledge hammer. \u201cYou should\u2019ve known better than to do what you did.\u201d</p><p>He swung the hammer in to your lower abdomen and you groan in pain. He repeated the action three more times until dark purple bruises started to form and you were choking on your own blood.</p><p>\u201cWhere did we go wrong? What did we do to have our best soldiers turn their backs from us like that?\u201d He asked as he brought the hammer a few inches above the last hit.</p><p>A few of your ribs snapped with a sickening crack making you yelp. He then used the back of the tool to hit you in the cheek. Your head turned to the opposite way with the metallic taste of blood filling your mouth.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get you back to our side, there\u2019s no doubt in that.\u201d Stanislav said as he walked back to the cart and replaced the hammer with a pickaxe.</p><p>\u201cWe were about to crack Barnes actually,\u201d Tatyana added.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Stanislav made his way back to you. \u201cIt won\u2019t take too long until the four of us can rebuild again.\u201d</p><p>He slammed the dull side of the pickaxe to your left knee. It popped out of the socket and you screamed a blood curling scream.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you tell them?\u201d He asked, once again making his way around you and stopped right in front of your back.</p><p>When you didn\u2019t answer, the pickaxe landed on your pale back. You arched your back and let out a pained cry.</p><p>\u201cI asked you a question.\u201d He then dragged the pointy tool down to your waist line and you screamed once again.</p><p>\u201cHow much do the damn Avengers know?!\u201d He shouted, pressing the wooden handle to the wound</p><p>Hot seering pain spread to your whole body as fresh blood seeped out of the fresh wound. You screamed, almost begging him to stop.</p><p>Just then a loud clang was heard from the other room where Barnes was in. </p><p>Tatyana sighed, \u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d she said and left.</p><p>Stanislav went back to you after the quick distraction. You silently thanked Barnes for at least trying to buy you time. But that didn\u2019t last long, as your torturer walked back to the cart, putting down the pickaxe and choosing his next weapon.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are give me a headache,\u201d he said as he picked up a dagger. \u201cYou\u2019re such a pain in the ass.\u201d He planted the knife in to your stomach and you screamed again.</p><p>He pushed the knife deeper and twisted it, making the cut deeper and your cries louder. Black dots started to swim around your vision as you struggled to keep your eyes open.</p><p>\u201cAnswer the goddamn question,\u201d he whispered threateningly while holding your head close to him by your hair. \u201cHow much do the fucking Avengers know?\u201d</p><p>You still kept your mouth shut. He sighed and walked back to the cart.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get why people adore them so much. \u2018The Earth\u2019s mightiest heroes\u2019, and what\u2019s that? A bunch of fools trying to convince themselves and the world that they are human when they\u2019re much more than that. They weaken themselves to fit in, to be accepted. They\u2019ve killed innocent people. They\u2019re not saviours, at the end of the day they\u2019re just murderous freaks.\u201dHe paused and looked at you. \u201cMuch like you, actually.\u201d</p><p>His monologue soon turned to a bedtime story to you as you start to feel yourself slipping out of your conciousness. Stanislav noticed and he refused to let you die just yet. He picked up a crowbar and it hit you square in the face making your eyes  shot back open.</p><p>\u201cI asked you,\u201d he walked back towards you. \u201cWhat do the fucking Avengers know?!\u201d He pushed the knife even deeper in to you until half of the handle was swallowed inside your flesh. Your scream high pitched and your head was throbbing in pain. You swore that you were indeed going to die.</p><p>But then you heard a glass shatter followed by multiple loud crashes from the hallway.</p><p>\u201cEvakuivorat\u2019!\u201d You heard Tatyana shouted. Evacuate.</p><p>\u201cHow did they find out where we were?\u201d Stanislav snapped his head you. \u201cYou little shit.\u201d He then proceed to use the crowbar and hit the knife in you deeper. </p><p>You used the last ounce of energy within you to scream for help. Even though what came out was more of a sickening scream of incoherent words.</p><p>Just then, you saw the familiar hovering robot of yellow and red.</p><p>\u201cStep away from her, dickface.\u201d Was the last thing you heard before everything finally turned black.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p><b><a href=\"https://nagaindcsiar.tumblr.com/post/177931137801/subject-302-avengers-x-youngassassinreader\">Part 5</a></b></p><p><b>tag list:</b> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCCNAjP9ndzMFGDkgSK-_sw\">@chas-z</a> @captainsteverogers-68 <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5qT1vyjuSjNloHjNXCXOKQ\">@astarlith</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mf5euMbD11VZx8r1GMc-doA\">@katiecat260</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgMgLP_QPdtKJtY7nGT9rDg\">@rhapsodicmgc</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNfnGhi-Ag_U6ALuyiGXvDg\">@sw-michelle</a></p>",

He repeated the action three more times until dark purple bruises started to form and you were choking on your own blood.</p><p>\u201cWhere did we go wrong?

You silently thanked Barnes for at least trying to buy you time. But that didn\u2019t last long, as your torturer walked back to the cart, putting down the pickaxe and choosing his next weapon.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are give me a headache,\u201d he said as he picked up a dagger. \u201cYou\u2019re such a pain in the ass.\u201d He planted the knife in to your stomach and you screamed again.</p><p>He pushed the knife deeper and twisted it, making the cut deeper and your cries louder.

He sighed and walked back to the cart.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get why people adore them so much. \u2018The Earth\u2019s mightiest heroes\u2019, and what\u2019s that?

You eyed Tony with suspicion, trying to figure out his plan.</p><p>\u201cAs a bait?\u201d You asked, barely audible, you already knew what the answer was.</p><p>Steve walked towards your cell door and unlocked it. It opened, but you didn\u2019t move. </p><p>If your Creators find out you\u2019ve been providing information to The Avengers, who knows what they\u2019ll do to you. And as soon as you leave the building, you will also be leaving the protection it offers.</p><p>\u201cKid, lets go,\u201d Steve called.</p><p>You looked away from your hands and turned your attention to the people standing in front of you. You noticed Sam Wilson was there, his arm was still bandaged from when you burned it the other day. And you felt bad, for the first time ever.</p><p>Three days felt like three years in that cell, aside from the same stone faced lady who delivered you food three times a day, no one had visited you, not even Steve. And for some reason you were disappointed, even though you knew there was no reason for him, or anyone, to care about you.</p><p>You were used to cells, cages, and what not. But back in the HYDRA facility, they always give you something to do. Whether it\u2019ll be executing prisoners or more tests and tortures \u2013it was not fun, but it kept your mind occupied. Here, they don\u2019t do that.</p><p>Those three days really gave you the time to think. More than you liked. You thought about all the people you\u2019ve murdered without mercy, all the blood, all the life that fell in your hands. Something that never really crossed your mind before. </p><p>You thought, maybe this was your time to make up to all you\u2019ve done. Deep inside you know there\u2019s still a little bit of mercy and humanity within you, but you\u2019re starting to lose it. And maybe this was your time to bring it back to the surface. Or was it too late?</p><p>You took a deep breath and made up your mind. You got up from your bed and walked towards the door where Steve had been standing. He walked away from you towards the group and you followed. </p><p>\u201cAs soon as you get in touch with your people, you come to us, understood?\u201d Tony stuck something on your arm, making you flinch away from the sudden touch. \u201cGPS tracker, just in case.\u201d</p><p>You glared at him but didn\u2019t fight.</p><p>\u201cYour job is simple, you get out there, find your Creators, find out where Barnes is, and leave the rest to us.\u201d He continued.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re sure we can trust her?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cWe get you\u2019re still upset you were beaten up by a sixteen year old kid, Bird Man, but you need to get over it.\u201d Tony teased.</p><p>Steve, Tony, and Wanda then walked with you to the helipad of the HQ and it didn\u2019t take long until you landed in the middle of the busy city of New York. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna take off this collar, but you will not attack us, okay?\u201d Steve said sternly.</p><p>You nodded ever so slightly. He reached behind you and you heard a beep as he pressed a number in. The others tensed as Steve unwrapped the metal from your neck. You brought your arms up as you watched them glow red for the first time in days.</p><p>\u201cSnap out of it, kid.\u201d Tony warned. He then gave you a little black box with a screen on it, \u201cThat\u2019s called a pager, when you find Barnes press that button-\u201c he pointed, \u201cand we\u2019ll take it from there.\u201d</p><p>And just like that you were ushered out of the chopper and they flew away, leaving you alone. After roaming around the neighborhood mindlessly for a couple of hours, you decided to actually get to work and go visit your base.</p><p>You knew no one would be there by the time you arrive. Hell, they could be half way across the globe for all you know. They wouldn\u2019t hesitate to ditch you for the last Winter Soldier and you knew that. But you also knew they wouldn\u2019t let you go alive, especially if they\u2019ve found out that you\u2019ve snitched.</p><p>You opened the door to the building that you\u2019ve called your \u201chome\u201d for the past year. You roamed around, finding absolutely nothing. Your Creators had left and took everything with them.</p><p>Then you noticed a buzzing sound from the wide backyard of the warehouse. There you saw a pilotless drone hovering just above the ground, a drone you\u2019ve became all too familiar with. It used to be one of HYDRA\u2019s, except now the HYDRA logo was gone, leaving the machine plain jet black colored.</p><p>The door of the plane opened as you step out to the yard towards it. You inhaled deeply before finally boarding the aircraft.</p><p>You flew for hours and hours. It was already dark by the time you landed on a foreign field in the middle of nowhere. The drone opened in front of an abandoned warehouse, you stepped out of it and led yourself in to the building.</p><p>\u201cGreat to have you back,\u201d Stanislav greeted, emotionless. \u201cCome, follow me.\u201d</p><p>You did what you were told and followed the man up a staircase and in to a room. You saw another man strapped to a chair, the chair of your nightmares. He was panting, blood and sweat glistened over his muscled body. Near him stood Tatyana in her signature lab coat.</p><p>Stanislav walked past you to his co-worker and announced your arrival. He then guided her to exit the room while engaging in a conversation. You took this opportunity to press the button on the device Tony had given you. Then you slip the pager under the chair The Winter Soldier was sat on.</p><p>He looked up to you, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cYou shall not worry now,\u201d you said in Russian. \u201cYour friends are coming.\u201d</p><p>Before he could respond, your Creators entered back to the room.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to excuse me for a while, Barnes.\u201d Tatyana said. \u201cSeems like you\u2019re not the only one who needs to be taught a lesson.\u201d</p><p>Panic filled your eyes as you felt the all too familiar metal wrap around your neck. Stanislav grabbed you by your arms and dragged you out as you trashed, but he was much stronger than you as you were once again stripped out of your powers. Tatyana followed closely and before you lost sight of The Winter Soldier, you caught him tensing up in his seat watching them take you with worry in his eyes.</p><p>You were taken to a room right across and almost immediately Stanislav tied you up in between two poles with a chain. You struggled to break free unsuccessfully as he also wrap the chain around your legs, forcing you to sprawl like a starfish.</p><p>\u201cI heard about what you\u2019ve been up to lately, soldier.\u201d He circled around you like a lion eyeing his prey. \u201cWe expected better from you.\u201d</p><p>You can hear your heart thumping against your chest faster than usual. Stanislav returned in front of you and eyed you with hunger for blood.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d He referred to the jacket Steve had given to you to help you hide your arms in public. \u201cYou\u2019re hiding now. You\u2019re turning in to one of the weak.\u201d He ripped the jacket off of your body, exposing your toned abdomen.</p><p>Tatyana walked in to view pushing in an iron cart and you shuddered at the sight of it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to hide who you are. Are you that desperate for acknowledgement? To feel like a human?\u201d He continued, stressing on the word \u2018human\u2019 with such disgust. \u201cOh dear, you never were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the moment you were born, you were never meant to be human.\u201d Tatyana agreed. \u201cYou are destined to be ours, our soldier, our executioner.\u201d</p><p>Stanislav walked to the iron cart and picked up a sledge hammer. \u201cYou should\u2019ve known better than to do what you did.\u201d</p><p>He swung the hammer in to your lower abdomen and you groan in pain. He repeated the action three more times until dark purple bruises started to form and you were choking on your own blood.</p><p>\u201cWhere did we go wrong?

He sighed and walked back to the cart.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get why people adore them so much. \u2018The Earth\u2019s mightiest heroes\u2019, and what\u2019s that?

You noticed Sam Wilson was there, his arm was still bandaged from when you burned it the other day. And you felt bad, for the first time ever.</p><p>Three days felt like three years in that cell, aside from the same stone faced lady who delivered you food three times a day, no one had visited you, not even Steve. And for some reason you were disappointed, even though you knew there was no reason for him, or anyone, to care about you.</p><p>You were used to cells, cages, and what not. But back in the HYDRA facility, they always give you something to do. Whether it&rsquo;ll be executing prisoners or more tests and tortures &ndash;it was not fun, but it kept your mind occupied. Here, they don&rsquo;t do that.</p><p>Those three days really gave you the time to think. More than you liked. You thought about all the people you&rsquo;ve murdered without mercy, all the blood, all the life that fell in your hands. Something that never really crossed your mind before. </p><p>You thought, maybe this was your time to make up to all you&rsquo;ve done. Deep inside you know there&rsquo;s still a little bit of mercy and humanity within you, but you&rsquo;re starting to lose it. And maybe this was your time to bring it back to the surface. Or was it too late?</p><p>You took a deep breath and made up your mind. You got up from your bed and walked towards the door where Steve had been standing. He walked away from you towards the group and you followed. </p><p>&ldquo;As soon as you get in touch with your people, you come to us, understood?&rdquo; Tony stuck something on your arm, making you flinch away from the sudden touch. &ldquo;GPS tracker, just in case.&rdquo;</p><p>You glared at him but didn&rsquo;t fight.</p><p>&ldquo;Your job is simple, you get out there, find your Creators, find out where Barnes is, and leave the rest to us.&rdquo; He continued.</p><p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re sure we can trust her?&rdquo; Sam asked.</p><p>&ldquo;We get you&rsquo;re still upset you were beaten up by a sixteen year old kid, Bird Man, but you need to get over it.&rdquo; Tony teased.</p><p>Steve, Tony, and Wanda then walked with you to the helipad of the HQ and it didn&rsquo;t take long until you landed in the middle of the busy city of New York. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna take off this collar, but you will not attack us, okay?&rdquo; Steve said sternly.</p><p>You nodded ever so slightly. He reached behind you and you heard a beep as he pressed a number in. The others tensed as Steve unwrapped the metal from your neck. You brought your arms up as you watched them glow red for the first time in days.</p><p>&ldquo;Snap out of it, kid.&rdquo; Tony warned. He then gave you a little black box with a screen on it, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s called a pager, when you find Barnes press that button-&ldquo; he pointed, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll take it from there.&rdquo;</p><p>And just like that you were ushered out of the chopper and they flew away, leaving you alone. After roaming around the neighborhood mindlessly for a couple of hours, you decided to actually get to work and go visit your base.</p><p>You knew no one would be there by the time you arrive. Hell, they could be half way across the globe for all you know. They wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to ditch you for the last Winter Soldier and you knew that. But you also knew they wouldn&rsquo;t let you go alive, especially if they&rsquo;ve found out that you&rsquo;ve snitched.</p><p>You opened the door to the building that you&rsquo;ve called your &ldquo;home&rdquo; for the past year. You roamed around, finding absolutely nothing. Your Creators had left and took everything with them.</p><p>Then you noticed a buzzing sound from the wide backyard of the warehouse. There you saw a pilotless drone hovering just above the ground, a drone you&rsquo;ve became all too familiar with. It used to be one of HYDRA&rsquo;s, except now the HYDRA logo was gone, leaving the machine plain jet black colored.</p><p>The door of the plane opened as you step out to the yard towards it. You inhaled deeply before finally boarding the aircraft.</p><p>You flew for hours and hours. It was already dark by the time you landed on a foreign field in the middle of nowhere. The drone opened in front of an abandoned warehouse, you stepped out of it and led yourself in to the building.</p><p>&ldquo;Great to have you back,&rdquo; Stanislav greeted, emotionless. &ldquo;Come, follow me.&rdquo;</p><p>You did what you were told and followed the man up a staircase and in to a room. You saw another man strapped to a chair, the chair of your nightmares. He was panting, blood and sweat glistened over his muscled body. Near him stood Tatyana in her signature lab coat.</p><p>Stanislav walked past you to his co-worker and announced your arrival. He then guided her to exit the room while engaging in a conversation. You took this opportunity to press the button on the device Tony had given you. Then you slip the pager under the chair The Winter Soldier was sat on.</p><p>He looked up to you, puzzled.</p><p>&ldquo;You shall not worry now,&rdquo; you said in Russian. &ldquo;Your friends are coming.&rdquo;</p><p>Before he could respond, your Creators entered back to the room.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to excuse me for a while, Barnes.&rdquo; Tatyana said. &ldquo;Seems like you&rsquo;re not the only one who needs to be taught a lesson.&rdquo;</p><p>Panic filled your eyes as you felt the all too familiar metal wrap around your neck. Stanislav grabbed you by your arms and dragged you out as you trashed, but he was much stronger than you as you were once again stripped out of your powers. Tatyana followed closely and before you lost sight of The Winter Soldier, you caught him tensing up in his seat watching them take you with worry in his eyes.</p><p>You were taken to a room right across and almost immediately Stanislav tied you up in between two poles with a chain. You struggled to break free unsuccessfully as he also wrap the chain around your legs, forcing you to sprawl like a starfish.</p><p>&ldquo;I heard about what you&rsquo;ve been up to lately, soldier.&rdquo; He circled around you like a lion eyeing his prey. &ldquo;We expected better from you.&rdquo;</p><p>You can hear your heart thumping against your chest faster than usual. Stanislav returned in front of you and eyed you with hunger for blood.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; He referred to the jacket Steve had given to you to help you hide your arms in public. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re hiding now. You&rsquo;re turning in to one of the weak.&rdquo; He ripped the jacket off of your body, exposing your toned abdomen.</p><p>Tatyana walked in to view pushing in an iron cart and you shuddered at the sight of it.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to hide who you are. Are you that desperate for acknowledgement? To feel like a human?&rdquo; He continued, stressing on the word &lsquo;human&rsquo; with such disgust. &ldquo;Oh dear, you never were.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;From the moment you were born, you were never meant to be human.&rdquo; Tatyana agreed. &ldquo;You are destined to be ours, our soldier, our executioner.&rdquo;</p><p>Stanislav walked to the iron cart and picked up a sledge hammer. &ldquo;You should&rsquo;ve known better than to do what you did.&rdquo;</p><p>He swung the hammer in to your lower abdomen and you groan in pain. He repeated the action three more times until dark purple bruises started to form and you were choking on your own blood.</p><p>&ldquo;Where did we go wrong? What did we do to have our best soldiers turn their backs from us like that?&rdquo; He asked as he brought the hammer a few inches above the last hit.</p><p>A few of your ribs snapped with a sickening crack making you yelp. He then used the back of the tool to hit you in the cheek. Your head turned to the opposite way with the metallic taste of blood filling your mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get you back to our side, there&rsquo;s no doubt in that.&rdquo; Stanislav said as he walked back to the cart and replaced the hammer with a pickaxe.</p><p>&ldquo;We were about to crack Barnes actually,&rdquo; Tatyana added.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Stanislav made his way back to you. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take too long until the four of us can rebuild again.&rdquo;</p><p>He slammed the dull side of the pickaxe to your left knee. It popped out of the socket and you screamed a blood curling scream.</p><p>&ldquo;What did you tell them?&rdquo; He asked, once again making his way around you and stopped right in front of your back.</p><p>When you didn&rsquo;t answer, the pickaxe landed on your pale back. You arched your back and let out a pained cry.</p><p>&ldquo;I asked you a question.&rdquo; He then dragged the pointy tool down to your waist line and you screamed once again.</p><p>&ldquo;How much do the damn Avengers know?!&rdquo; He shouted, pressing the wooden handle to the wound</p><p>Hot seering pain spread to your whole body as fresh blood seeped out of the fresh wound. You screamed, almost begging him to stop.</p><p>Just then a loud clang was heard from the other room where Barnes was in. </p><p>Tatyana sighed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back,&rdquo; she said and left.</p><p>Stanislav went back to you after the quick distraction. You silently thanked Barnes for at least trying to buy you time. But that didn&rsquo;t last long, as your torturer walked back to the cart, putting down the pickaxe and choosing his next weapon.</p><p>&ldquo;You guys are give me a headache,&rdquo; he said as he picked up a dagger. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a pain in the ass.&rdquo; He planted the knife in to your stomach and you screamed again.</p><p>He pushed the knife deeper and twisted it, making the cut deeper and your cries louder. Black dots started to swim around your vision as you struggled to keep your eyes open.</p><p>&ldquo;Answer the goddamn question,&rdquo; he whispered threateningly while holding your head close to him by your hair. &ldquo;How much do the fucking Avengers know?&rdquo;</p><p>You still kept your mouth shut. He sighed and walked back to the cart.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get why people adore them so much. &lsquo;The Earth&rsquo;s mightiest heroes&rsquo;, and what&rsquo;s that? A bunch of fools trying to convince themselves and the world that they are human when they&rsquo;re much more than that. They weaken themselves to fit in, to be accepted. They&rsquo;ve killed innocent people. They&rsquo;re not saviours, at the end of the day they&rsquo;re just murderous freaks.&rdquo;He paused and looked at you. &ldquo;Much like you, actually.&rdquo;</p><p>His monologue soon turned to a bedtime story to you as you start to feel yourself slipping out of your conciousness. Stanislav noticed and he refused to let you die just yet. He picked up a crowbar and it hit you square in the face making your eyes  shot back open.</p><p>&ldquo;I asked you,&rdquo; he walked back towards you. &ldquo;What do the fucking Avengers know?!&rdquo; He pushed the knife even deeper in to you until half of the handle was swallowed inside your flesh. Your scream high pitched and your head was throbbing in pain. You swore that you were indeed going to die.</p><p>But then you heard a glass shatter followed by multiple loud crashes from the hallway.</p><p>&ldquo;Evakuivorat&rsquo;!&rdquo; You heard Tatyana shouted. Evacuate.</p><p>&ldquo;How did they find out where we were?&rdquo; Stanislav snapped his head you. &ldquo;You little shit.&rdquo; He then proceed to use the crowbar and hit the knife in you deeper. </p><p>You used the last ounce of energy within you to scream for help. Even though what came out was more of a sickening scream of incoherent words.</p><p>Just then, you saw the familiar hovering robot of yellow and red.</p><p>&ldquo;Step away from her, dickface.&rdquo; Was the last thing you heard before everything finally turned black.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p><b><a href=\"https://nagaindcsiar.tumblr.com/post/177931137801/subject-302-avengers-x-youngassassinreader\">Part 5</a></b></p><p><b>tag list:</b> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCCNAjP9ndzMFGDkgSK-_sw\">@chas-z</a> @captainsteverogers-68 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5qT1vyjuSjNloHjNXCXOKQ\">@astarlith</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mf5euMbD11VZx8r1GMc-doA\">@katiecat260</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgMgLP_QPdtKJtY7nGT9rDg\">@rhapsodicmgc</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNfnGhi-Ag_U6ALuyiGXvDg\">@sw-michelle</a></p></p>",

But remember I have my own beliefs as well! And, thats what they are, PERSONAL BELIEFS. *Let us not blur Fact from opinion!* \nHunter S Thompson is my literary idol. Film idols... too many to list. Music idols would be Ice Cube, or Jim Morrison. Comedic Idols include George Carlin, Richard Pryor, David Cross, Chris Rock, ANY MONTY PYTHON.\nMy dream is to one day be a film editor, a Special FX master, An Established Photographer, or a Comedian.
