        "answer": "<p>YES THANK YOU I LOVE THIS</p>\n\n<p>After being friends with Harry for over 3 years, you\u2019d prided yourself on always being able to read him. You knew when he was upset about something, or annoyed with you, or trying to hold himself back from laughing. If you were watching a scary movie together, you knew exactly when to offer your hand to him to hold tight until he relaxed. One time you\u2019d even gone over to his apartment with a tub of salted caramel ice cream close to midnight because you could tell that something was wrong based on the sound of his voice on the phone. He\u2019d opened the door looking confused for only the briefest moment before breaking down in tears in your arms. You always seemed to know what he needed.</p><!-- more -->\n\n<p>But you can\u2019t read him today. You can tell that something is off with him, but you can\u2019t quite put your finger on what. He\u2019s been at your apartment for the better part of two hours, but he still hasn\u2019t come out with it. At first it seemed like everything was fine, but then he started to pick at his nails and pinch his bottom lip between his fingers. You only ever saw him do that when he was nervous about something \u2013 but he always told you when he was anxious, and he hasn\u2019t said anything yet. It makes you nervous too, only because this is unchartered territory between the two of you. You don\u2019t know what to make of it, and decide to let him take his time before he decides to tell you whatever the hell is up.</p>\n\n<p>He\u2019s lounging on the couch, mindlessly scrolling through his phone while Notting Hill plays on the TV. You think he\u2019s solely focused on his phone, but he proves you wrong when he occasionally pipes in with some of the characters\u2019 lines. After a little while, you get bored with the movie and the unusual silence. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cDo you wanna watch something else?\u201d You ask him. He looks affronted, as if he\u2019s offended at the mere suggestion.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHarry, you\u2019ve seen this movie, like, ten times. Just with me.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>His bottom lip juts out and he looks away from you. \u201cSo? It\u2019s a good movie.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>You roll your eyes, but play along because he just looks so damn cute. \u201cThen why aren\u2019t you watching it?\u201d You retort, gesturing towards his phone. He raises his eyes at you in what you think will be a challenge, but he only puts his phone down and stares directly at the TV.</p>\n\n<p>Weird. You want to say something back, but you\u2019re thrown off by his change in behaviour. He\u2019s never acted this way around you before, and you can\u2019t help but wonder if it\u2019s something you did without realising it. But if he\u2019s mad at you, why would he have come over in the first place?</p>\n\n<p>Harry watches the rest of the movie with eyes glued to the screen but seems distant, as if he\u2019s deep in thought about something else. You watch too but can\u2019t help but look over to him every few minutes. He doesn\u2019t acknowledge your glances, even though you\u2019re sure that he can see you in his peripheral vision. </p>\n\n<p>Once the credits roll, neither of you move. You\u2019re starting to get sick of waiting for him to tell you what\u2019s wrong, but you don\u2019t want to push him away. You\u2019ve never had to walk on eggshells around him before and you find that it\u2019s harder than you ever thought it might be. All you want is for everything to go back to normal.</p>\n\n<p>You decide to prompt the conversation gently. \u201cIs everything okay, Harry?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He\u2019s silent for a minute, and you let him take his time responding. But when he does speak, his voice sounds thin. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Do you wanna watch another movie?\u201d It\u2019s the put-on voice that you\u2019ve heard him use around people he doesn\u2019t know very well, when he wants to appear confident and cool. It\u2019s not a voice he\u2019s ever used to talk to you. </p>\n\n<p>You ignore his question. \u201cHarry.\u201d Your voice is firm and unwavering, telling him that you\u2019re not going to let this slide. He blushes and looks down into his lap, chipping off pieces of pink nail polish. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m- I can\u2019t-\u201c He starts, clearly uncomfortable. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to-\u201c</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Harry. Whatever it is.\u201d You try to comfort him by placing a hand on his arm, but his muscles only tense. Your brows furrow at the unexpected response and he heaves a deep sigh before looking you dead in the eyes.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI love you. And not just as a friend. I\u2019ve got real feelings for you, and have for a long time. I understand if you don\u2019t-\u201c</p>\n\n<p>You break off his rambled confessions by pressing your lips against his, surprising you both. He\u2019s soft and warm and you feel a calm certainty wash over you \u2013 nothing has ever felt so right.</p>",

Above the albums, above the travelling, even the awards. He loved his three girls more than anything, but there was something about the two little girls that you had brought into the world together. Their curly hair that matched his perfectly, though theirs were a lighter brown, almost blonde in colour; their light eyes that matched their daddy\u2019s perfectly; and their skin that was as perfect as yours-at least that\u2019s what Harry liked to tell you.\u00a0</p><p>Each day, no matter how tired he was, Harry would be up before you and walking into the twins\u2019 bedroom to pick them up from their cots, bringing each of them to his chest for a hug before walking them down the stairs and towards the living room.\u00a0</p><p>Before they were born, his mornings would consist of waking up and grabbing his journal, walking to the kitchen to have a cold glass of water and a quick write of what he was feeling as he woke up. However, since the day you brought them home from the hospital nearly 18 months ago, he would wake up when they would, taking them downstairs and spending at least an hour with them before you woke up.\u00a0</p><p>Both girls would be fed before you walked downstairs, and as you entered the living room where the three loves of your life sat, Harry would kiss your lips quickly before sauntering off and bringing you a steaming cup of coffee to wake you up, all while you got to snuggle your babies and make them giggle as you tickled their pudgy little bellies.\u00a0</p><p>No matter how much time he spent with them on a morning, Harry would never dress your little girls for he knew that you loved taking them up to their room together to get them dressed for the day.\u00a0</p><p>That morning was no different.\u00a0</p><p>Harry had woken up to the smallest sound coming from your daughters\u2019 nursery, turning off the monitor that sat next to your bed, and kissing your forehead lightly. He knew you were awake too, but he wanted to let you rest, and you wanted him to have the hour on his own with his girls.\u00a0</p><p>He hated the fact that he had to travel for work still and fretted that he was missing out on their lives, and that hour a day was all he needed to know that he was a good daddy, and that his children loved him.\u00a0</p><p>He left the bedroom and pulled the door closed softly, the only sounds being heard in your bedroom being his footsteps on the landing of your forever home. You snuggled yourself back into the covers knowing that your girls were being looked after. You could hear Harry talking to the two girls as he walked down the stairs, holding one of their hands as they slid down on their bums- something Harry knew you didn\u2019t like and so would only do it when they were on his own with them.\u00a0</p><p>An hour later, you ventured out of the bedroom, one of Harry\u2019s tour hoodie\u2019s covering your top half, and down the stairs towards the living room where you heard giggles and Harry\u2019s baby voice.\u00a0</p><p>For a while you stood in the doorway, watching your children squirm on the floor while their daddy tickled their bellies and blew raspberries on them. You smiled at the interaction, taking a deep breath and enjoying the view before you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMy, my, what do we have going on here?\u201d The two little girls saw you and tried to push their dad away from them, crawling over to you and pulling at your legs. You picked them both up and held them close to your chest, watching as Harry walked over to you too.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMorning, gorgeous.\u201d A small kiss was pressed to your lips before he walked toward the kitchen where you knew he was preparing you a mug of coffee.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou two are super lazy this morning. You both know that you can walk to mummy, yet you crawled instead. Cheeky monkeys.\u201d You sat yourself down on the sofa and pushed yourself back, letting your babies lay on your chest and snuggle into you. Since Harry had been tickling them when you got downstairs, you enjoyed them cuddling you and wanting to be as close as they could be.\u00a0</p><p>Harry walked in with a cup of coffee, though when he saw you snuggled with his children, he placed it on the coffee table before joining you, moving his hand to be around your shoulders so he could pull you close.\u00a0</p><p>The youngest of the twins, Marcie, looked up and decided she wanted to cuddle her daddy instead, and so shifted from you onto Harry, cuddling into his neck and leaving Melodie with more room to snuggle you.\u00a0</p><p>The day you decided on names for your babies was a day you\u2019d never forget.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cI just don\u2019t see either of them looking like a </i>Bluebell <i>if I\u2019m being totally honest with you\u201d.

Now, what about a second name?\u201d You shrugged your shoulders, not knowing what to call your second baby.\u00a0</i></p><p> <i>Growing up you never saw yourself having twins, and so, when the sonographer told you that there were two little babies growing inside your stomach, you were scared but oh so excited.

I want you to have his green eyes and his curly hair. I don\u2019t care if you look nothing like me, I want you to be your daddy\u2019s double.\u201d You smiled to yourself before Harry walked back into the room, guitar in hand and smile spread across his face.\u00a0</i></p><p> <i>\u201cNow, I only have the melody so far, so please don\u2019t hate me if this is crap.\u201d You couldn\u2019t reply to Harry for you were frozen in place.\u00a0</i></p><p> <i>\u201cMelodie\u201d.</i>\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cMelodie?\u201d\u00a0</i></p><p> <i>\u201cWith an \u2018ie\u2019.

Harry replicated your touch on Marcie, who only snuggled further into his chest. Out of them both, Marcie was the daddy\u2019s girl, while Melodie was definitely clingy toward you. It wouldn\u2019t matter where you were, she wanted to be hugged by you and you only.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about, H?\u201d You\u2019d noticed Harry staring off into the distance, his eyes not blinking much but his bottom lip being pulled into his teeth.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI was thinking.

You could hear Harry talking to the two girls as he walked down the stairs, holding one of their hands as they slid down on their bums- something Harry knew you didn\u2019t like and so would only do it when they were on his own with them.\u00a0</p><p>An hour later, you ventured out of the bedroom, one of Harry\u2019s tour hoodie\u2019s covering your top half, and down the stairs towards the living room where you heard giggles and Harry\u2019s baby voice.\u00a0</p><p>For a while you stood in the doorway, watching your children squirm on the floor while their daddy tickled their bellies and blew raspberries on them. You smiled at the interaction, taking a deep breath and enjoying the view before you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMy, my, what do we have going on here?\u201d The two little girls saw you and tried to push their dad away from them, crawling over to you and pulling at your legs.

You both know that you can walk to mummy, yet you crawled instead. Cheeky monkeys.\u201d You sat yourself down on the sofa and pushed yourself back, letting your babies lay on your chest and snuggle into you. Since Harry had been tickling them when you got downstairs, you enjoyed them cuddling you and wanting to be as close as they could be.\u00a0</p><p>Harry walked in with a cup of coffee, though when he saw you snuggled with his children, he placed it on the coffee table before joining you, moving his hand to be around your shoulders so he could pull you close.\u00a0</p><p>The youngest of the twins, Marcie, looked up and decided she wanted to cuddle her daddy instead, and so shifted from you onto Harry, cuddling into his neck and leaving Melodie with more room to snuggle you.\u00a0</p><p>The day you decided on names for your babies was a day you\u2019d never forget.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cI just don\u2019t see either of them looking like a </i>Bluebell <i>if I\u2019m being totally honest with you\u201d.

Now, what about a second name?\u201d You shrugged your shoulders, not knowing what to call your second baby.\u00a0</i></p><p> <i>Growing up you never saw yourself having twins, and so, when the sonographer told you that there were two little babies growing inside your stomach, you were scared but oh so excited.

I want you to have his green eyes and his curly hair. I don\u2019t care if you look nothing like me, I want you to be your daddy\u2019s double.\u201d You smiled to yourself before Harry walked back into the room, guitar in hand and smile spread across his face.\u00a0</i></p><p> <i>\u201cNow, I only have the melody so far, so please don\u2019t hate me if this is crap.\u201d You couldn\u2019t reply to Harry for you were frozen in place.\u00a0</i></p><p> <i>\u201cMelodie\u201d.</i>\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cMelodie?\u201d\u00a0</i></p><p> <i>\u201cWith an \u2018ie\u2019.

Harry replicated your touch on Marcie, who only snuggled further into his chest. Out of them both, Marcie was the daddy\u2019s girl, while Melodie was definitely clingy toward you. It wouldn\u2019t matter where you were, she wanted to be hugged by you and you only.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about, H?\u201d You\u2019d noticed Harry staring off into the distance, his eyes not blinking much but his bottom lip being pulled into his teeth.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI was thinking.

Above the albums, above the travelling, even the awards. He loved his three girls more than anything, but there was something about the two little girls that you had brought into the world together. Their curly hair that matched his perfectly, though theirs were a lighter brown, almost blonde in colour; their light eyes that matched their daddy&rsquo;s perfectly; and their skin that was as perfect as yours-at least that&rsquo;s what Harry liked to tell you.&nbsp;</p><p>Each day, no matter how tired he was, Harry would be up before you and walking into the twins&rsquo; bedroom to pick them up from their cots, bringing each of them to his chest for a hug before walking them down the stairs and towards the living room.&nbsp;</p><p>Before they were born, his mornings would consist of waking up and grabbing his journal, walking to the kitchen to have a cold glass of water and a quick write of what he was feeling as he woke up. However, since the day you brought them home from the hospital nearly 18 months ago, he would wake up when they would, taking them downstairs and spending at least an hour with them before you woke up.&nbsp;</p><p>Both girls would be fed before you walked downstairs, and as you entered the living room where the three loves of your life sat, Harry would kiss your lips quickly before sauntering off and bringing you a steaming cup of coffee to wake you up, all while you got to snuggle your babies and make them giggle as you tickled their pudgy little bellies.&nbsp;</p><p>No matter how much time he spent with them on a morning, Harry would never dress your little girls for he knew that you loved taking them up to their room together to get them dressed for the day.&nbsp;</p><p>That morning was no different.&nbsp;</p><p>Harry had woken up to the smallest sound coming from your daughters&rsquo; nursery, turning off the monitor that sat next to your bed, and kissing your forehead lightly. He knew you were awake too, but he wanted to let you rest, and you wanted him to have the hour on his own with his girls.&nbsp;</p><p>He hated the fact that he had to travel for work still and fretted that he was missing out on their lives, and that hour a day was all he needed to know that he was a good daddy, and that his children loved him.&nbsp;</p><p>He left the bedroom and pulled the door closed softly, the only sounds being heard in your bedroom being his footsteps on the landing of your forever home.
