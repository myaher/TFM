Besides, I like school.\u201d</p><p>\tHarry looked up at her. \u201c<i>Beck!</i> Come on. You like school more than me?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cSchool doesn\u2019t snore,\u201d she retorted.</p><p>\tHe quickly got on top of her, sitting on her hips. \u201cSchool doesn\u2019t do this either, does it?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cSquish me? It definitely feels like it sometimes,\u201d she said, refusing to play along just yet.</p><p>\t\u201cNot squish you,\u201d he mumbled, bending over and kissing her neck. \u00a0</p><p>\tHe ran his hands down her bare sides, hearing her breath catch in her chest as his mouth went lower and lower.</p><p>\t\u201cHmm?\u201d He pressed.</p><p>\t\u201cMhm, Harry,\u201d she moaned, before sitting up and throwing him off his balance. \u201cStill not skipping.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re so weird,\u201d he groaned, lying on his back and sadly staring at his growing erection. \u201cWho <i>wants</i> to go to class?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cMe,\u201d she said, finding her shirt on the floor.</p><p>\t\u201cThis is why you should join a sorority. Then you\u2019d have pledges to do your school stuff for you. And you could spend more time with me,\u201d he grinned, watching her get dressed.</p><p>\t\u201cNo thanks,\u201d she shook her head. \u201cHave you seen my underwear?\u201d</p><p>\tHarry dangled it from his middle finger. \u201cGot to come over here to get it back.\u201d</p><p>\tBecks tried to grab it, but he held it behind him. \u00a0Leaning to get it, he pulled her down on top of him. </p><p>\t\u201cHarry, come on,\u201d she sighed.</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re no fun this morning,\u201d he complained.</p><p>\t\u201cFine,\u201d she sat up. \u201cGuess I\u2019m not wearing underwear today.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cReally unfair to leave me with that visual!\u201d He yelled after her.</p><p>\tBecks quietly walked down the hallway of the frat house, which was still quiet at this hour. \u00a0Niall Horan unexpectedly popped out of his bedroom, trying to button up his shirt and walk at the same time.</p><p>\t\u201cMorning Becks,\u201d he waved.</p><p>\t\u201cHi,\u201d she smiled.</p><p>\t\u201cComing to the party tonight?\u201d Niall asked.</p><p>\t\u201cOh, I forgot about that,\u201d she frowned.</p><p>\t\u201cAll the Kappa girls are too,\u201d Niall said. \u201cC\u2019mon, you have to. Harry\u2019ll be all sad and mopey if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\tBecks blushed. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll text Kennedy. What\u2019s the theme?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cMathletes and Athletes,\u201d he grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be awesome.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d she said. \u201cHave a good day.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>Becks really wasn\u2019t envious of her friends outfits as she sat down with them in the dining hall. \u00a0There was some event that their sorority was partaking in this afternoon, and that meant wearing letters. \u00a0Their nauseating pastel shirts were adorned with Kappa\u2019s Greek letters in neon Lilly Pulitzer prints.</p><p>\tThe next time Harry suggested she join the sorority, Becks was going to direct him to one of those shirts. \u00a0She would never be caught dead in Lilly Pulitzer, that was for sure. \u00a0</p><p>\tIt was kind of funny that she\u2019d fallen in with the sorority, given her disdain for Greek life. \u00a0It was doubly funny that her boyfriend was the stereotypical frat boy. \u00a0But she didn\u2019t make fun of Greek life too much, because without it she wouldn\u2019t have met the girls, or Harry.</p><p>\tBecks had been late for a class freshman year, after missing orientation due to a water skiing accident, and accidentally wandered into the Kappa sorority house while looking for U.S. history. \u00a0To this day, she maintained that it wasn\u2019t her fault. \u00a0All of the old buildings on campus looked just like the sorority and fraternity houses.</p><p>\tKennedy had been in the process of telling Becks that she was a stalker who needed to get out when she noticed the shoes Becks had been wearing.</p><p>\tAt any other college, Becks would have been the cool girl. \u00a0She had an amazing wardrobe, cool connections, and she was beautiful. \u00a0But here, at a college where Greek life was more important than anything else, she was a social reject.</p><p>\tWhen Kennedy noticed her shoes, which had only been made for the Saint Laurent Spring/Summer runway and were impossible to find, they had formed a fast friendship. \u00a0What started as a materialistic connection turned into a genuine bond, and with Kennedy\u2019s approval Becks fell in with the Kappa girls.</p><p>\t\u201cAlright, what\u2019s everyone wearing tonight?\u201d Kennedy clapped her hands from the head of the table.</p><p>\t\u201cSomething slutty,\u201d was the response she got from most girls.</p><p>\t\u201cAnd you, my dear Beckett?\u201d Kennedy smiled at Becks.</p><p>\t\u201cPuh-lease do not call me that,\u201d Becks rolled her eyes. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll just wear a button down with glasses and be a Mathlete.\u201d</p><p>\tThe rest of the girls seemed saddened by her inability to see how important outfit choices were at a frat party.</p><p>\t\u201cNo, you will wear something tight fitting with glasses,\u201d Kennedy corrected her.</p><p>\t\u201cWhy? I have a boyfriend. He\u2019s stuck with me, he knows what I\u2019m working with whether my shirt is tight or not,\u201d Becks groaned. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to go, I\u2019m so tired.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cMaybe if you would let our pledges take your notes, you could skip class and take a nap,\u201d Priscilla suggested. \u201cAs we\u2019ve already told you a million times.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t want someone else\u2019s notes,\u201d Becks insisted. \u201cI can take my own.\u201d</p><p>\tIf Harry knew that she was completely able to get notes and could skip class more often to hang out with him, he would be rather annoyed. \u00a0Not so much because she wasn\u2019t spending time with him, but because she was lying.</p><p>\tHe just didn\u2019t get it. \u00a0Becks <i>liked</i> school. \u00a0She liked sitting in lectures, taking notes, and writing papers. \u00a0Not that it was exactly good old fashioned fun, but it was a part of college. \u00a0And she didn\u2019t mind one bit. \u00a0If she tried to tell her boyfriend, the king of skipping classes, how she felt, he would probably want her tested for illness.</p><p>\t\u201cEveryone will meet tonight in the house living room to pregame at 9,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cThat includes you, Becks.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m going to go get some homework done before the weekend,\u201d Becks said, standing up. \u201cSee you tonight.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>Adjusting her tight, white dress, Becks inspected herself in the mirror. \u00a0Little buttons went down the middle of the dress all the way to the bottom, kind of like a button up shirt. \u00a0She wore her thick-rimmed black glasses, which were really only for reading the white boards in class. \u00a0Her hair was up in a bun, and she was ready to go.</p><p>\tShe really wished she could skip the party and go to the end of the night, which would mean getting into bed with Harry. \u00a0But the party would be fun. \u00a0Probably.</p><p>\tThe Kappa girls greeted her warmly when she arrived at the pregame, taking the cup someone handed her. \u00a0Sitting down on the couch, she looked at the messages she\u2019d gotten from Harry on her walk here.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"710\" data-orig-width=\"400\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c18841281dd31c2acb29084a2d3137f1/tumblr_inline_pc7uu1G6PX1ulp6w2_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"710\" data-orig-width=\"400\"/></figure><p>\tShe put her phone away, her lack of response sure to drive him insane. \u00a0Instead she focused on the girls, who were discussing some fundraiser that involved washing cars in bikinis. \u00a0Becks didn\u2019t even wash her own car, she couldn\u2019t imagine washing a stranger\u2019s in one of her swimsuits.</p><p>\tThe girls were all giggling and shrieking by the time they arrived at the frat house. \u00a0Inside they found an already massive crowd dressed in a mixture of athletic jerseys and sweater vests. \u00a0Harry was very easy to spot, standing up on a couch in his basketball jersey and snapback. \u00a0Becks winced when Liam Payne threw a beer at his chest, which he caught in the nick of time.</p><p>\tHe jumped off the couch when he saw her, pushing through the crowds until he was at her side. \u00a0Harry was one of the most popular people on campus, yet he seemed to have no idea. \u00a0He\u2019d give polite waves and smiles as he passed, not seeming to realize that all eyes were on him.</p><p>\t\u201cHi,\u201d he said, giving Becks a kiss. \u201cHi girls, let me steal her for a bit.\u201d</p><p>\tKennedy and Priscilla rolled her eyes, knowing full well that they wouldn\u2019t be seeing Becks until tomorrow.</p><p>\t\u201cMissed you,\u201d she smiled at him, wrapping her arms around his neck.</p><p>\t\u201cNot enough to cuddle with me this morning,\u201d he mumbled, tugging on her lower lip. \u201cMy pretty girl. Hey, I got us something cool.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cIs this going to be another vibrator?\u201d She raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\t\u201cDon\u2019t give me that face, you liked it,\u201d he scoffed. \u201cAnd no, even better. C\u2019mere.\u201d</p><p>\tBecks followed Harry upstairs to his room. \u00a0He happily picked up some papers from his printer and handed them to her with a proud smile.</p><p>\t\u201cPlane ticket?\u201d She scanned the sheet in her hands. \u201cYou\u2019re going away this Wednesday?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNope,\u201d he shook his head. \u201cWe both are.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cHarry!\u201d Her smile turned into a frown when she saw the dates. \u201cBut\u2026 I\u2019d be missing four days of class. Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and not getting back in until Monday afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cBeck,\u201d Harry said, his shoulders tensing. \u201cI\u2019m taking you on vacation and that\u2019s your first thought? School?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNo, my first thought is that it\u2019s so sweet of you,\u201d she shook her head. \u201cBut that\u2019s a lot of class to miss.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhy are you so obsessed with school?\u201d He groaned, flopping back onto his bed.</p><p>\t\u201cBecause I\u2019m a student?\u201d She tried.</p><p>\t\u201cCan you just let me do one nice fucking thing?\u201d Harry snapped.</p><p>\tHer mouth opened, because she hadn\u2019t expected him to get so angry so quickly. \u00a0Harry\u2019s mom worked for a prominent travel magazine, so she knew he probably got these tickets through her. \u00a0And it was so sweet and thoughtful, but she wished he had checked with her before he took them. \u00a0She had a test on Thursday, and her lab on Friday. \u00a0There was just no way she could miss this much work without her grades severely suffering.</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re some fucking scholarship kid,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou\u2019re not losing anything by not going to class for once in your life. What, are you scared someone will take your seat in the front row?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cDon\u2019t be mean,\u201d she said, toeing the ground with her sandals.</p><p>\t\u201cFine, I\u2019m mean, but you\u2019re just ridiculous,\u201d he huffed. \u201cI\u2019m trying to show you how serious I am about you, and about us, and you\u2019re just complaining about stupid shit.\u201d</p><p>\tBecks rolled her eyes at that. \u201cIf you want to show me how serious you are, stop swearing at me and having a fit.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cFine, I\u2019ll go by myself,\u201d Harry snapped, standing up. \u201cHave fun sitting through lectures that you\u2019ll never need again once you graduate!\u201d</p><p>\tShe winced as he slammed his bedroom door behind him, leaving her with the tickets and travel roster. \u00a0Gently placing them on his desk, she sucked her lower lip into her mouth. \u00a0Why did he have to get so worked up over this? \u00a0She could understand that he was disappointed, but he didn\u2019t need to be so mean.</p><p>\tSighing, she walked downstairs and back into the party. \u00a0She knew she should have skipped this. \u00a0Refreshing her drink, she decided that maybe she should try and talk to Harry just once more. \u00a0If he wasn\u2019t having it, they could talk tomorrow, but she would have preferred to go to sleep with him tonight knowing that they were okay.</p><p>\tHarry was tall, so it was easy to spot him at the beer pong table. \u00a0He and Liam were playing against Niall and Louis Tomlinson. \u00a0Harry held his hat to his head, as if he were afraid the backwards cap were going to fall off. \u00a0Standing in the gathered audience, Becks decided to wait until the game was through to say anything.</p><p>\tBut in her sandals she was short, so Harry had no idea his girlfriend was within earshot as he ranted to his friends and the small audience.</p><p>\t\u201cWhy\u2019s she like school so much? Like, who gives a fuck?\u201d Harry huffed. \u201cJust miss a few stupid classes to hang out with your boyfriend. She\u2019s such a freak sometimes, and not in the way I like her to be.\u201d</p><p>\tNiall snorted and rolled his eyes, as Becks\u2019 stomach dropped. \u201cNone of us are concerned with that aspect. We all hear you two just about every damn night, Harry. Or should I say <i>Daddy?</i>\u201d</p><p>\tBecks\u2019 cheeks burned with humiliation, but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to walk away or speak up.</p><p>\t\u201cAs least someone\u2019s calling me something,\u201d Harry rolled his eyes.</p><p>\t\u201cShe is really obsessed with school, it\u2019s weird,\u201d Liam agreed. \u201cWhy won\u2019t she just join Kappa?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWon\u2019t get off her fuckin\u2019 high horse,\u201d Harry muttered, drinking from a cup even though it wasn\u2019t his turn. \u201cShe really knows how to get on my nerves. Trying to show her I can be a good boyfriend and this is what I get.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cCan I come?\u201d Louis asked. \u201cInstead of Becks?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cSure, why not? You know what, why don\u2019t you and Eleanor just take the tickets? Like I give a fuck. I might as well be here with the weirdo listening to stories about professors and papers,\u201d Harry sighed dramatically.</p><p>\t<i>Weirdo?</i> \u00a0Becks\u2019 jaw clenched. \u00a0She could tell from the unfocused look in Harry\u2019s green eyes that he was drunk, but that was no excuse. \u00a0They had one little disagreement, and here he was telling anyone within earshot about how strange she was.</p><p>\t\u201cSo break up with her,\u201d Liam shrugged.</p><p>\tHarry paused, and the pause broke her heart. \u201cNah, probably not.\u201d</p><p>\tShe had heard enough. \u00a0Turning on her heel, she pulled her glasses off and walked through the crowd as tears streaked down her cheeks. \u00a0Being a good student wasn\u2019t a crime, at least, it shouldn\u2019t be. \u00a0But maybe in the world of Harry Styles where solo cups were textbooks and coming up with lies to get out of things were essays, it was.</p><p>\t\u201cShit!\u201d She heard Harry yell, and she quickened her pace.</p><p>\tShe was not going to cry in front of him, and she wasn\u2019t going to get into an argument in front of the entire party.</p><p>\t\u201cBeck, Becks!\u201d Harry panted, running after her. \u201cPlease wait up baby, please.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOh, so now I\u2019m your baby?\u201d She couldn\u2019t help it, turning around and putting her hands on her hips.</p><p>\t\u201cN-no, don\u2019t cry,\u201d he said, reaching forward to dry her tears.</p><p>\tShe smacked his hand away. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>\tHarry sighed heavily. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean any of that, I never would have\u2026\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhat? Never would have said it if you knew I was there? Would have waited until later when I was out of earshot?\u201d She supplied some possible answers for him.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2026\u201d Harry wasn\u2019t used to being put on the spot.</p><p>\t\u201cI had no idea it was so difficult for you to be around me,\u201d she said quietly, aware that everyone was listening. \u201cMaybe you should stay away to help yourself feel better.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNo, no,\u201d he shook his head.</p><p>\t\u201cSome boyfriend,\u201d she said under her breath, walking away before he had the chance to come up with something.</p><p>\tShe walked and walked, until she found herself back in her own room. \u00a0Pulling the dress off, she got into her pajamas as she continued to sob. \u00a0But her pajamas were an old t-shirt and boxers of Harry\u2019s, so she ripped those off and got into bed naked.</p><p>\tShe and Harry were different, and that was why they worked. \u00a0Or so she thought. \u00a0He was the crazy frat boy, and she was the good girl. \u00a0In some ways they made no sense, yet they meshed together perfectly.</p><p>\tHearing him complain about her to anyone willing to listen hurt more than she could have imagined. \u00a0His words were ringing in her ears, no matter how hard she tried to block them out. \u00a0So she stuck her headphones in and fell asleep listening to breakup songs.</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>\u201cBaby? Please open the door, I know you\u2019re in there,\u201d Harry groaned, leaning his forehead against her door.</p><p>\tBecks sat silently at her little kitchen table, working through a calculus problem. \u00a0He\u2019d been out there for approximately thirteen minutes. \u00a0They were on day four of not speaking, mostly because of her. \u00a0He didn\u2019t call or text her until two days after the incident, and she ignored him. \u00a0He kept texting and calling before switching to house calls. \u00a0But she hadn\u2019t let him in, she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\tShe felt like their entire two year relationship had been a lie. \u00a0They\u2019d had their ups and downs, but nothing had ever been as hurtful as this. \u00a0She found herself wondering if maybe Harry was only with her as some sort of extended joke.</p><p>\t\u201cPlease?\u201d His voice wobbled, and she held her face in her hands. \u201cI miss you Becks, come on. Can you just talk to me?\u201d</p><p>\tShe cried silently, closing her textbook. \u00a0Getting work done was impossible when she was so completely miserable.</p><p>\t\u201cFine,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cI\u2019ll try again tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\tBecks cried loudly once he was gone. \u00a0She didn\u2019t know what to do. \u00a0Talking about it was terrifying, but she couldn\u2019t ignore him forever. \u00a0He was still her boyfriend, even if he\u2019d fucked up like this.</p><p>\tKennedy had demanded her presence at dinner in the dining hall, so Becks set to icing her puffy, red eyes and picking out a outfit that had casual yes-I\u2019m-fine undertones. \u00a0Sighing, she said a quick prayer that Harry would be eating at the frat house.</p><p>\tWhen Becks approached the usual Kappa table, she found Niall Horan on his knees at Kennedy\u2019s feet. \u00a0Briefly forgetting her own problems, she sat down next to Della.</p><p>\t\u201cPlease, you can\u2019t cancel,\u201d Niall moaned. \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite day of the year.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOh, sorry Niall,\u201d Kennedy mock pouted. \u201cBut Kappa will no longer be fraternizing with you boys. I heard the Alpha Phi girls are free, though. Probably because of that herpes outbreak, but you\u2019ve got to take what you can get.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cHe\u2019s sorry, he\u2019s so sorry,\u201d Niall insisted, grabbing her hands. \u201cYou can\u2019t cancel the date party.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cToo late,\u201d Kennedy said, shaking him off.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Becks asked Della.</p><p>\tDella smiled at her. \u201cWe decided that we won\u2019t be involved with them anymore. Kennedy told us what Harry was saying, that sucks.\u201d</p><p>\tBecks\u2019 cheeks turned red when she realized she was causing the chasm between the two groups. \u00a0On one hand she felt embarrassed, but on the other she hoped Harry was getting all of the blame for this.</p><p>\t\u201cWe\u2019ll kick him out of the frat,\u201d Niall said firmly. \u201cJust say the word, he\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWell?\u201d Kennedy raised an eyebrow, looking at Becks.</p><p>\t\u201cNo!\u201d Becks shook her head rapidly. \u201cYou can\u2019t kick him out, that\u2019s insane. Just have the stupid date party.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhat she said!\u201d Niall nodded.</p><p>\t\u201cShe\u2019s nice,\u201d Kennedy frowned. \u201cI\u2019m not. Maybe you\u2019ll remember this when you\u2019re recruiting next year.\u201d</p><p>\tNiall finally gave up, glaring at the table Harry was at as he left the dining hall. \u201cHey man, fuck you!\u201d</p><p>\tBecks slouched lower in her seat, hoping that nobody knew what was going on and that it all revolved around her.</p><p>\t\u201cYou can have the party,\u201d she said quietly, looking at Kennedy.</p><p>\t\u201cNo, we can\u2019t,\u201d Kennedy said firmly. \u201cThey\u2019re clearly not up to par if that\u2019s how they talk about people. It wasn\u2019t just Harry, it was his friends. And Niall Horan kind of creeps me out, anyways.\u201d</p><p>\tPriscilla, who frequently hooked up with Niall, rolled her eyes at that.</p><p>\t\u201cSo what are you doing if you\u2019re not having the party?\u201d Becks asked. \u201cDon\u2019t you have the place rented out and stuff?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d Della frowned.</p><p>\t\u201cOh my God, I know!\u201d Kennedy clapped her hands suddenly. \u201cMakeover party!\u201d</p><p>\tBecks winced, but the other girls all seemed thrilled at the prospect. \u00a0Everyone began calling her favorite salon to request their stylists for the night, giggling to one another as they were put on hold.</p><p>\t\u201cAnd obviously you\u2019re coming,\u201d Kennedy said.</p><p>\tBecks pretended not to hear.</p><p>\t\u201cBeckett, hello?\u201d Kennedy said louder.</p><p>\t\u201cOh my God, stop,\u201d Becks huffed. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI hope the bar lets us have a makeover party,\u201d Kennedy frowned. \u201cOh well, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\tBecks ate some of her salad as the girls planned. \u00a0She figured that even if she was losing her boyfriend, she still had some pretty amazing friends.</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWhy do you even come to the library?\u201d Priscilla asked. \u201cYou get straight A\u2019s even if you don\u2019t study.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cJust wanted a change of scenery,\u201d Becks mumbled.</p><p>\tShe was seated at the Kappa table in the library, which was currently full of sorority sisters cramming for their midterms. \u00a0Not that Becks needed to fit any more studying in, but staying in her own room was a hazard. \u00a0Harry was constantly trying to talk to her, so she needed some peace and quiet. \u00a0Unfortunately, that meant sitting in the library.</p><p>\t\u201cOh my God,\u201d Della whispered. \u201cLook.\u201d</p><p>\tBecks didn\u2019t bother looking up. \u00a0She didn\u2019t want to gossip or people watch. \u00a0She just wanted to get a head start on her reading, go to bed, and hopefully not cry tonight. \u00a0It had now been six days since she spoke to Harry. \u00a0She thought that it would get easier, but it didn\u2019t. \u00a0It was still just as heartbreaking as it had been in that moment.</p><p>\t\u201cLook!\u201d Kennedy pinched her thigh, making her jump.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat?\u201d Becks hissed.</p><p>\tKennedy nodded at the entrance. \u00a0The girls always sat on the third floor of the library, because everyone knew that was the cool area. \u00a0It was the best place for people watching, and the Starbucks was on this floor.</p><p>\tHarry was walking in, carrying a bouquet of flowers and wearing a flannel. \u00a0In other words, dressed up more so than usual. \u00a0Running a hand through his hair, his eyes locked with hers.</p><p>\t\u201cGood evening, ladies,\u201d he said, approaching the table.</p><p>\t\u201cWalk away,\u201d Kennedy said, leaning back in her seat and crossing her arms over her chest.</p><p>\t\u201cDon\u2019t think so,\u201d he said, giving her an annoying little smile as he stepped up onto the table. \u201cUh, excuse me? Can I have everyone\u2019s attention?\u201d</p><p>\tHad anyone else stepped on a table in the middle of the library and demanded everyone\u2019s consideration, they would have been laughed out of the building. \u00a0But it was Harry, so people stopped what they were doing and listened.</p><p>\t\u201cSo last week, I really hurt my girlfriend\u2019s feelings at a party. I was trying to do something nice, but I didn\u2019t really ask her about her opinion on the matter and I got really frustrated and screamed at her,\u201d Harry sighed, not even blushing under all of the eyes on him.</p><p>\tBecks stared up at him with wide eyes, unable to believe this was happening.</p><p>\t\u201cAnd after that I got really drunk, and I was telling anyone who would listen all sorts of lies to make myself feel better about fucking up. I thought she\u2019d left, but she was there and she heard. Hi, Beck, how\u2019s it going?\u201d He smiled down at her, seeming to forget where he was for a moment.</p><p>\t\u201cHi,\u201d she whispered, hands shaking as she held her book.</p><p>\t\u201cNow you won\u2019t talk to me. You ignore me when I knock at your door, and all of your friends are ignoring me too. And I\u2026 I can\u2019t lose you. I don\u2019t want to go back to life without you,\u201d he shook his head.</p><p>\tSeveral girls let out <i>awww</i>\u2019s at that.</p><p>\t\u201cI love you more than anything. I love you as much as you love school. Which is fine, there\u2019s nothing wrong with loving school. Someone\u2019s got to, I suppose,\u201d he said, giving her a tiny smile. \u201cAnd I shouldn\u2019t make fun of you, or anyone else, to make myself feel better. I should never have jeopardized our relationship. I know that now.\u201d</p><p>\tHer eyes were tearing now, because it was like he\u2019d somehow read her mind and figured out everything she wanted to hear in an apology.</p><p>\t\u201cPlease just talk to me,\u201d he begged, getting down on his knees so he was nearly at her level. \u201cI miss you so much, and I love you.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cHarry,\u201d she sniffled, wiping a tear away.</p><p>\t\u201cHmm?\u201d He leaned in closer, an anxious look on his face.</p><p>\t\u201cI love you too, can you get down?\u201d She asked, smiling at him.</p><p>\tHarry sat down on her notebooks. \u00a0He handed her the bouquet he\u2019d been holding, smiling shyly.</p><p>\t\u201cI miss you so much,\u201d he mumbled, finally noticing how everyone was watching with rapt attention.</p><p>\t\u201cI miss you too,\u201d she nodded, hugging the flowers to her chest.</p><p>\tBecks stood up and kissed him, making everyone begin to applaud wildly. \u00a0Her cheeks burned as she buried her face against his neck. \u00a0Harry placed his hands on the small of her back, pressing kisses to the top of her head.</p><p>\t\u201cI am so sorry,\u201d he sighed. \u201cMore than I can say. I love you and your books and flashcards and all of it.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI love you too,\u201d she murmured, picking her head up as the clapping subsided.</p><p>\t\u201cYou wanna sleep over tonight?\u201d He asked, pulling her closer.</p><p>\t\u201cLet\u2019s sleep at mine,\u201d she suggested, indicating the flowers. \u201cI should put these in water.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cRight,\u201d he agreed, picking up her things and shouldering her backpack. \u201cOh, and Kennedy?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYeah?\u201d Kennedy tried to stop smiling at the cuteness.</p><p>\t\u201cPlease still have the formal, I think Niall\u2019s experiencing clinical depression over it,\u201d he grinned.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do,\u201d she nodded.</p><p>\t\u201cYou and I aren\u2019t going,\u201d Harry told Becks as they walked out of the library.</p><p>\t\u201cWhy?\u201d She frowned.</p><p>\t\u201cBecause we won\u2019t be here that weekend,\u201d he shook his head. \u201cOur flight leaves after your Friday lab, and we get back Sunday around eleven at night. Don\u2019t worry about being tired for your Monday morning lit class, I talked to your professor and she was going to cancel that class anyways.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cReally?\u201d She smiled widely.</p><p>\t\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t miss stuff if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d he shrugged, holding her hand tightly. \u201cAnd I checked with all of your other professors, you haven\u2019t got any tests or papers due the week we\u2019re back, so you shouldn\u2019t have too much homework.\u201d</p><p>\tShe stopped and kissed him. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI love you like Niall loves Kappa,\u201d he grinned.</p><p>\t\u201cShut up,\u201d she rolled her eyes.</p><p>\t\u201cIn all seriousness,\u201d Harry cleared his throat. \u201cI fucked up and I want to make it up to you. Whatever it takes.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou don\u2019t have to make it up to me,\u201d she shook her head, unlocking her door.</p><p>\t\u201cI can try,\u201d he grinned, putting the flowers down. \u201cNow c\u2019mere, it\u2019s been a lonely six days.\u201d</p><hr><p><b>a/n: would like to take this time to say that i\u2019m v v v saddened by the fact that none of my readers likened the title of my last harry one shot (holiday in the sun) to mary kate and ashley\u2019s second most iconic film</b></p><p><b>ok hope you enjoyed</b></p>",

You like school more than me?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cSchool doesn\u2019t snore,\u201d she retorted.</p><p>\tHe quickly got on top of her, sitting on her hips. \u201cSchool doesn\u2019t do this either, does it?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cSquish me? It definitely feels like it sometimes,\u201d she said, refusing to play along just yet.</p><p>\t\u201cNot squish you,\u201d he mumbled, bending over and kissing her neck. \u00a0</p><p>\tHe ran his hands down her bare sides, hearing her breath catch in her chest as his mouth went lower and lower.</p><p>\t\u201cHmm?\u201d He pressed.</p><p>\t\u201cMhm, Harry,\u201d she moaned, before sitting up and throwing him off his balance. \u201cStill not skipping.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re so weird,\u201d he groaned, lying on his back and sadly staring at his growing erection. \u201cWho <i>wants</i> to go to class?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cMe,\u201d she said, finding her shirt on the floor.</p><p>\t\u201cThis is why you should join a sorority.

And you could spend more time with me,\u201d he grinned, watching her get dressed.</p><p>\t\u201cNo thanks,\u201d she shook her head. \u201cHave you seen my underwear?\u201d</p><p>\tHarry dangled it from his middle finger. \u201cGot to come over here to get it back.\u201d</p><p>\tBecks tried to grab it, but he held it behind him. \u00a0Leaning to get it, he pulled her down on top of him. </p><p>\t\u201cHarry, come on,\u201d she sighed.</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re no fun this morning,\u201d he complained.</p><p>\t\u201cFine,\u201d she sat up. \u201cGuess I\u2019m not wearing underwear today.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cReally unfair to leave me with that visual!\u201d He yelled after her.</p><p>\tBecks quietly walked down the hallway of the frat house, which was still quiet at this hour. \u00a0Niall Horan unexpectedly popped out of his bedroom, trying to button up his shirt and walk at the same time.</p><p>\t\u201cMorning Becks,\u201d he waved.</p><p>\t\u201cHi,\u201d she smiled.</p><p>\t\u201cComing to the party tonight?\u201d Niall asked.</p><p>\t\u201cOh, I forgot about that,\u201d she frowned.</p><p>\t\u201cAll the Kappa girls are too,\u201d Niall said. \u201cC\u2019mon, you have to. Harry\u2019ll be all sad and mopey if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\tBecks blushed. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll text Kennedy. What\u2019s the theme?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cMathletes and Athletes,\u201d he grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be awesome.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d she said. \u201cHave a good day.\u201d</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>Becks really wasn\u2019t envious of her friends outfits as she sat down with them in the dining hall. \u00a0There was some event that their sorority was partaking in this afternoon, and that meant wearing letters. \u00a0Their nauseating pastel shirts were adorned with Kappa\u2019s Greek letters in neon Lilly Pulitzer prints.</p><p>\tThe next time Harry suggested she join the sorority, Becks was going to direct him to one of those shirts. \u00a0She would never be caught dead in Lilly Pulitzer, that was for sure. \u00a0</p><p>\tIt was kind of funny that she\u2019d fallen in with the sorority, given her disdain for Greek life. \u00a0It was doubly funny that her boyfriend was the stereotypical frat boy. \u00a0But she didn\u2019t make fun of Greek life too much, because without it she wouldn\u2019t have met the girls, or Harry.</p><p>\tBecks had been late for a class freshman year, after missing orientation due to a water skiing accident, and accidentally wandered into the Kappa sorority house while looking for U.S. history. \u00a0To this day, she maintained that it wasn\u2019t her fault. \u00a0All of the old buildings on campus looked just like the sorority and fraternity houses.</p><p>\tKennedy had been in the process of telling Becks that she was a stalker who needed to get out when she noticed the shoes Becks had been wearing.</p><p>\tAt any other college, Becks would have been the cool girl. \u00a0She had an amazing wardrobe, cool connections, and she was beautiful. \u00a0But here, at a college where Greek life was more important than anything else, she was a social reject.</p><p>\tWhen Kennedy noticed her shoes, which had only been made for the Saint Laurent Spring/Summer runway and were impossible to find, they had formed a fast friendship. \u00a0What started as a materialistic connection turned into a genuine bond, and with Kennedy\u2019s approval Becks fell in with the Kappa girls.</p><p>\t\u201cAlright, what\u2019s everyone wearing tonight?\u201d Kennedy clapped her hands from the head of the table.</p><p>\t\u201cSomething slutty,\u201d was the response she got from most girls.</p><p>\t\u201cAnd you, my dear Beckett?\u201d Kennedy smiled at Becks.</p><p>\t\u201cPuh-lease do not call me that,\u201d Becks rolled her eyes. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll just wear a button down with glasses and be a Mathlete.\u201d</p><p>\tThe rest of the girls seemed saddened by her inability to see how important outfit choices were at a frat party.</p><p>\t\u201cNo, you will wear something tight fitting with glasses,\u201d Kennedy corrected her.</p><p>\t\u201cWhy? I have a boyfriend. He\u2019s stuck with me, he knows what I\u2019m working with whether my shirt is tight or not,\u201d Becks groaned. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to go, I\u2019m so tired.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cMaybe if you would let our pledges take your notes, you could skip class and take a nap,\u201d Priscilla suggested. \u201cAs we\u2019ve already told you a million times.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t want someone else\u2019s notes,\u201d Becks insisted. \u201cI can take my own.\u201d</p><p>\tIf Harry knew that she was completely able to get notes and could skip class more often to hang out with him, he would be rather annoyed. \u00a0Not so much because she wasn\u2019t spending time with him, but because she was lying.</p><p>\tHe just didn\u2019t get it. \u00a0Becks <i>liked</i> school. \u00a0She liked sitting in lectures, taking notes, and writing papers. \u00a0Not that it was exactly good old fashioned fun, but it was a part of college. \u00a0And she didn\u2019t mind one bit. \u00a0If she tried to tell her boyfriend, the king of skipping classes, how she felt, he would probably want her tested for illness.</p><p>\t\u201cEveryone will meet tonight in the house living room to pregame at 9,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cThat includes you, Becks.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m going to go get some homework done before the weekend,\u201d Becks said, standing up. \u201cSee you tonight.\u201d</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>Adjusting her tight, white dress, Becks inspected herself in the mirror. \u00a0Little buttons went down the middle of the dress all the way to the bottom, kind of like a button up shirt. \u00a0She wore her thick-rimmed black glasses, which were really only for reading the white boards in class. \u00a0Her hair was up in a bun, and she was ready to go.</p><p>\tShe really wished she could skip the party and go to the end of the night, which would mean getting into bed with Harry. \u00a0But the party would be fun. \u00a0Probably.</p><p>\tThe Kappa girls greeted her warmly when she arrived at the pregame, taking the cup someone handed her. \u00a0Sitting down on the couch, she looked at the messages she\u2019d gotten from Harry on her walk here.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"710\" data-orig-width=\"400\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c18841281dd31c2acb29084a2d3137f1/tumblr_inline_pc7uu1G6PX1ulp6w2_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"710\" data-orig-width=\"400\"></figure><p>\tShe put her phone away, her lack of response sure to drive him insane. \u00a0Instead she focused on the girls, who were discussing some fundraiser that involved washing cars in bikinis. \u00a0Becks didn\u2019t even wash her own car, she couldn\u2019t imagine washing a stranger\u2019s in one of her swimsuits.</p><p>\tThe girls were all giggling and shrieking by the time they arrived at the frat house. \u00a0Inside they found an already massive crowd dressed in a mixture of athletic jerseys and sweater vests. \u00a0Harry was very easy to spot, standing up on a couch in his basketball jersey and snapback. \u00a0Becks winced when Liam Payne threw a beer at his chest, which he caught in the nick of time.</p><p>\tHe jumped off the couch when he saw her, pushing through the crowds until he was at her side. \u00a0Harry was one of the most popular people on campus, yet he seemed to have no idea. \u00a0He\u2019d give polite waves and smiles as he passed, not seeming to realize that all eyes were on him.</p><p>\t\u201cHi,\u201d he said, giving Becks a kiss. \u201cHi girls, let me steal her for a bit.\u201d</p><p>\tKennedy and Priscilla rolled her eyes, knowing full well that they wouldn\u2019t be seeing Becks until tomorrow.</p><p>\t\u201cMissed you,\u201d she smiled at him, wrapping her arms around his neck.</p><p>\t\u201cNot enough to cuddle with me this morning,\u201d he mumbled, tugging on her lower lip. \u201cMy pretty girl. Hey, I got us something cool.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cIs this going to be another vibrator?\u201d She raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\t\u201cDon\u2019t give me that face, you liked it,\u201d he scoffed. \u201cAnd no, even better. C\u2019mere.\u201d</p><p>\tBecks followed Harry upstairs to his room. \u00a0He happily picked up some papers from his printer and handed them to her with a proud smile.</p><p>\t\u201cPlane ticket?\u201d She scanned the sheet in her hands. \u201cYou\u2019re going away this Wednesday?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNope,\u201d he shook his head. \u201cWe both are.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cHarry!\u201d Her smile turned into a frown when she saw the dates. \u201cBut\u2026 I\u2019d be missing four days of class. Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and not getting back in until Monday afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cBeck,\u201d Harry said, his shoulders tensing. \u201cI\u2019m taking you on vacation and that\u2019s your first thought? School?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNo, my first thought is that it\u2019s so sweet of you,\u201d she shook her head. \u201cBut that\u2019s a lot of class to miss.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhy are you so obsessed with school?\u201d He groaned, flopping back onto his bed.</p><p>\t\u201cBecause I\u2019m a student?\u201d She tried.</p><p>\t\u201cCan you just let me do one nice fucking thing?\u201d Harry snapped.</p><p>\tHer mouth opened, because she hadn\u2019t expected him to get so angry so quickly. \u00a0Harry\u2019s mom worked for a prominent travel magazine, so she knew he probably got these tickets through her. \u00a0And it was so sweet and thoughtful, but she wished he had checked with her before he took them. \u00a0She had a test on Thursday, and her lab on Friday. \u00a0There was just no way she could miss this much work without her grades severely suffering.</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re some fucking scholarship kid,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou\u2019re not losing anything by not going to class for once in your life. What, are you scared someone will take your seat in the front row?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cDon\u2019t be mean,\u201d she said, toeing the ground with her sandals.</p><p>\t\u201cFine, I\u2019m mean, but you\u2019re just ridiculous,\u201d he huffed. \u201cI\u2019m trying to show you how serious I am about you, and about us, and you\u2019re just complaining about stupid shit.\u201d</p><p>\tBecks rolled her eyes at that. \u201cIf you want to show me how serious you are, stop swearing at me and having a fit.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cFine, I\u2019ll go by myself,\u201d Harry snapped, standing up. \u201cHave fun sitting through lectures that you\u2019ll never need again once you graduate!\u201d</p><p>\tShe winced as he slammed his bedroom door behind him, leaving her with the tickets and travel roster. \u00a0Gently placing them on his desk, she sucked her lower lip into her mouth. \u00a0Why did he have to get so worked up over this? \u00a0She could understand that he was disappointed, but he didn\u2019t need to be so mean.</p><p>\tSighing, she walked downstairs and back into the party. \u00a0She knew she should have skipped this. \u00a0Refreshing her drink, she decided that maybe she should try and talk to Harry just once more. \u00a0If he wasn\u2019t having it, they could talk tomorrow, but she would have preferred to go to sleep with him tonight knowing that they were okay.</p><p>\tHarry was tall, so it was easy to spot him at the beer pong table. \u00a0He and Liam were playing against Niall and Louis Tomlinson. \u00a0Harry held his hat to his head, as if he were afraid the backwards cap were going to fall off. \u00a0Standing in the gathered audience, Becks decided to wait until the game was through to say anything.</p><p>\tBut in her sandals she was short, so Harry had no idea his girlfriend was within earshot as he ranted to his friends and the small audience.</p><p>\t\u201cWhy\u2019s she like school so much? Like, who gives a fuck?\u201d Harry huffed. \u201cJust miss a few stupid classes to hang out with your boyfriend. She\u2019s such a freak sometimes, and not in the way I like her to be.\u201d</p><p>\tNiall snorted and rolled his eyes, as Becks\u2019 stomach dropped. \u201cNone of us are concerned with that aspect. We all hear you two just about every damn night, Harry. Or should I say <i>Daddy?</i>\u201d</p><p>\tBecks\u2019 cheeks burned with humiliation, but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to walk away or speak up.</p><p>\t\u201cAs least someone\u2019s calling me something,\u201d Harry rolled his eyes.</p><p>\t\u201cShe is really obsessed with school, it\u2019s weird,\u201d Liam agreed. \u201cWhy won\u2019t she just join Kappa?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWon\u2019t get off her fuckin\u2019 high horse,\u201d Harry muttered, drinking from a cup even though it wasn\u2019t his turn. \u201cShe really knows how to get on my nerves. Trying to show her I can be a good boyfriend and this is what I get.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cCan I come?\u201d Louis asked. \u201cInstead of Becks?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cSure, why not? You know what, why don\u2019t you and Eleanor just take the tickets? Like I give a fuck. I might as well be here with the weirdo listening to stories about professors and papers,\u201d Harry sighed dramatically.</p><p>\t<i>Weirdo?</i> \u00a0Becks\u2019 jaw clenched. \u00a0She could tell from the unfocused look in Harry\u2019s green eyes that he was drunk, but that was no excuse. \u00a0They had one little disagreement, and here he was telling anyone within earshot about how strange she was.</p><p>\t\u201cSo break up with her,\u201d Liam shrugged.</p><p>\tHarry paused, and the pause broke her heart. \u201cNah, probably not.\u201d</p><p>\tShe had heard enough. \u00a0Turning on her heel, she pulled her glasses off and walked through the crowd as tears streaked down her cheeks. \u00a0Being a good student wasn\u2019t a crime, at least, it shouldn\u2019t be. \u00a0But maybe in the world of Harry Styles where solo cups were textbooks and coming up with lies to get out of things were essays, it was.</p><p>\t\u201cShit!\u201d She heard Harry yell, and she quickened her pace.</p><p>\tShe was not going to cry in front of him, and she wasn\u2019t going to get into an argument in front of the entire party.</p><p>\t\u201cBeck, Becks!\u201d Harry panted, running after her. \u201cPlease wait up baby, please.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOh, so now I\u2019m your baby?\u201d She couldn\u2019t help it, turning around and putting her hands on her hips.</p><p>\t\u201cN-no, don\u2019t cry,\u201d he said, reaching forward to dry her tears.</p><p>\tShe smacked his hand away. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>\tHarry sighed heavily. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean any of that, I never would have\u2026\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhat? Never would have said it if you knew I was there? Would have waited until later when I was out of earshot?\u201d She supplied some possible answers for him.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2026\u201d Harry wasn\u2019t used to being put on the spot.</p><p>\t\u201cI had no idea it was so difficult for you to be around me,\u201d she said quietly, aware that everyone was listening. \u201cMaybe you should stay away to help yourself feel better.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNo, no,\u201d he shook his head.</p><p>\t\u201cSome boyfriend,\u201d she said under her breath, walking away before he had the chance to come up with something.</p><p>\tShe walked and walked, until she found herself back in her own room. \u00a0Pulling the dress off, she got into her pajamas as she continued to sob. \u00a0But her pajamas were an old t-shirt and boxers of Harry\u2019s, so she ripped those off and got into bed naked.</p><p>\tShe and Harry were different, and that was why they worked. \u00a0Or so she thought. \u00a0He was the crazy frat boy, and she was the good girl. \u00a0In some ways they made no sense, yet they meshed together perfectly.</p><p>\tHearing him complain about her to anyone willing to listen hurt more than she could have imagined. \u00a0His words were ringing in her ears, no matter how hard she tried to block them out. \u00a0So she stuck her headphones in and fell asleep listening to breakup songs.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>\u201cBaby? Please open the door, I know you\u2019re in there,\u201d Harry groaned, leaning his forehead against her door.</p><p>\tBecks sat silently at her little kitchen table, working through a calculus problem. \u00a0He\u2019d been out there for approximately thirteen minutes. \u00a0They were on day four of not speaking, mostly because of her. \u00a0He didn\u2019t call or text her until two days after the incident, and she ignored him. \u00a0He kept texting and calling before switching to house calls. \u00a0But she hadn\u2019t let him in, she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\tShe felt like their entire two year relationship had been a lie. \u00a0They\u2019d had their ups and downs, but nothing had ever been as hurtful as this. \u00a0She found herself wondering if maybe Harry was only with her as some sort of extended joke.</p><p>\t\u201cPlease?\u201d His voice wobbled, and she held her face in her hands. \u201cI miss you Becks, come on. Can you just talk to me?\u201d</p><p>\tShe cried silently, closing her textbook. \u00a0Getting work done was impossible when she was so completely miserable.</p><p>\t\u201cFine,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cI\u2019ll try again tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\tBecks cried loudly once he was gone. \u00a0She didn\u2019t know what to do. \u00a0Talking about it was terrifying, but she couldn\u2019t ignore him forever. \u00a0He was still her boyfriend, even if he\u2019d fucked up like this.</p><p>\tKennedy had demanded her presence at dinner in the dining hall, so Becks set to icing her puffy, red eyes and picking out a outfit that had casual yes-I\u2019m-fine undertones. \u00a0Sighing, she said a quick prayer that Harry would be eating at the frat house.</p><p>\tWhen Becks approached the usual Kappa table, she found Niall Horan on his knees at Kennedy\u2019s feet. \u00a0Briefly forgetting her own problems, she sat down next to Della.</p><p>\t\u201cPlease, you can\u2019t cancel,\u201d Niall moaned. \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite day of the year.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOh, sorry Niall,\u201d Kennedy mock pouted. \u201cBut Kappa will no longer be fraternizing with you boys. I heard the Alpha Phi girls are free, though. Probably because of that herpes outbreak, but you\u2019ve got to take what you can get.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cHe\u2019s sorry, he\u2019s so sorry,\u201d Niall insisted, grabbing her hands. \u201cYou can\u2019t cancel the date party.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cToo late,\u201d Kennedy said, shaking him off.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Becks asked Della.</p><p>\tDella smiled at her. \u201cWe decided that we won\u2019t be involved with them anymore. Kennedy told us what Harry was saying, that sucks.\u201d</p><p>\tBecks\u2019 cheeks turned red when she realized she was causing the chasm between the two groups. \u00a0On one hand she felt embarrassed, but on the other she hoped Harry was getting all of the blame for this.</p><p>\t\u201cWe\u2019ll kick him out of the frat,\u201d Niall said firmly. \u201cJust say the word, he\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWell?\u201d Kennedy raised an eyebrow, looking at Becks.</p><p>\t\u201cNo!\u201d Becks shook her head rapidly. \u201cYou can\u2019t kick him out, that\u2019s insane. Just have the stupid date party.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhat she said!\u201d Niall nodded.</p><p>\t\u201cShe\u2019s nice,\u201d Kennedy frowned. \u201cI\u2019m not. Maybe you\u2019ll remember this when you\u2019re recruiting next year.\u201d</p><p>\tNiall finally gave up, glaring at the table Harry was at as he left the dining hall. \u201cHey man, fuck you!\u201d</p><p>\tBecks slouched lower in her seat, hoping that nobody knew what was going on and that it all revolved around her.</p><p>\t\u201cYou can have the party,\u201d she said quietly, looking at Kennedy.</p><p>\t\u201cNo, we can\u2019t,\u201d Kennedy said firmly. \u201cThey\u2019re clearly not up to par if that\u2019s how they talk about people. It wasn\u2019t just Harry, it was his friends. And Niall Horan kind of creeps me out, anyways.\u201d</p><p>\tPriscilla, who frequently hooked up with Niall, rolled her eyes at that.</p><p>\t\u201cSo what are you doing if you\u2019re not having the party?\u201d Becks asked. \u201cDon\u2019t you have the place rented out and stuff?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d Della frowned.</p><p>\t\u201cOh my God, I know!\u201d Kennedy clapped her hands suddenly. \u201cMakeover party!\u201d</p><p>\tBecks winced, but the other girls all seemed thrilled at the prospect. \u00a0Everyone began calling her favorite salon to request their stylists for the night, giggling to one another as they were put on hold.</p><p>\t\u201cAnd obviously you\u2019re coming,\u201d Kennedy said.</p><p>\tBecks pretended not to hear.</p><p>\t\u201cBeckett, hello?\u201d Kennedy said louder.</p><p>\t\u201cOh my God, stop,\u201d Becks huffed. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI hope the bar lets us have a makeover party,\u201d Kennedy frowned. \u201cOh well, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\tBecks ate some of her salad as the girls planned. \u00a0She figured that even if she was losing her boyfriend, she still had some pretty amazing friends.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhy do you even come to the library?\u201d Priscilla asked. \u201cYou get straight A\u2019s even if you don\u2019t study.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cJust wanted a change of scenery,\u201d Becks mumbled.</p><p>\tShe was seated at the Kappa table in the library, which was currently full of sorority sisters cramming for their midterms. \u00a0Not that Becks needed to fit any more studying in, but staying in her own room was a hazard. \u00a0Harry was constantly trying to talk to her, so she needed some peace and quiet. \u00a0Unfortunately, that meant sitting in the library.</p><p>\t\u201cOh my God,\u201d Della whispered. \u201cLook.\u201d</p><p>\tBecks didn\u2019t bother looking up. \u00a0She didn\u2019t want to gossip or people watch. \u00a0She just wanted to get a head start on her reading, go to bed, and hopefully not cry tonight. \u00a0It had now been six days since she spoke to Harry. \u00a0She thought that it would get easier, but it didn\u2019t. \u00a0It was still just as heartbreaking as it had been in that moment.</p><p>\t\u201cLook!\u201d Kennedy pinched her thigh, making her jump.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat?\u201d Becks hissed.</p><p>\tKennedy nodded at the entrance. \u00a0The girls always sat on the third floor of the library, because everyone knew that was the cool area. \u00a0It was the best place for people watching, and the Starbucks was on this floor.</p><p>\tHarry was walking in, carrying a bouquet of flowers and wearing a flannel. \u00a0In other words, dressed up more so than usual. \u00a0Running a hand through his hair, his eyes locked with hers.</p><p>\t\u201cGood evening, ladies,\u201d he said, approaching the table.</p><p>\t\u201cWalk away,\u201d Kennedy said, leaning back in her seat and crossing her arms over her chest.</p><p>\t\u201cDon\u2019t think so,\u201d he said, giving her an annoying little smile as he stepped up onto the table. \u201cUh, excuse me? Can I have everyone\u2019s attention?\u201d</p><p>\tHad anyone else stepped on a table in the middle of the library and demanded everyone\u2019s consideration, they would have been laughed out of the building. \u00a0But it was Harry, so people stopped what they were doing and listened.</p><p>\t\u201cSo last week, I really hurt my girlfriend\u2019s feelings at a party. I was trying to do something nice, but I didn\u2019t really ask her about her opinion on the matter and I got really frustrated and screamed at her,\u201d Harry sighed, not even blushing under all of the eyes on him.</p><p>\tBecks stared up at him with wide eyes, unable to believe this was happening.</p><p>\t\u201cAnd after that I got really drunk, and I was telling anyone who would listen all sorts of lies to make myself feel better about fucking up. I thought she\u2019d left, but she was there and she heard. Hi, Beck, how\u2019s it going?\u201d He smiled down at her, seeming to forget where he was for a moment.</p><p>\t\u201cHi,\u201d she whispered, hands shaking as she held her book.</p><p>\t\u201cNow you won\u2019t talk to me. You ignore me when I knock at your door, and all of your friends are ignoring me too. And I\u2026 I can\u2019t lose you. I don\u2019t want to go back to life without you,\u201d he shook his head.</p><p>\tSeveral girls let out <i>awww</i>\u2019s at that.</p><p>\t\u201cI love you more than anything. I love you as much as you love school. Which is fine, there\u2019s nothing wrong with loving school. Someone\u2019s got to, I suppose,\u201d he said, giving her a tiny smile. \u201cAnd I shouldn\u2019t make fun of you, or anyone else, to make myself feel better. I should never have jeopardized our relationship. I know that now.\u201d</p><p>\tHer eyes were tearing now, because it was like he\u2019d somehow read her mind and figured out everything she wanted to hear in an apology.</p><p>\t\u201cPlease just talk to me,\u201d he begged, getting down on his knees so he was nearly at her level. \u201cI miss you so much, and I love you.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cHarry,\u201d she sniffled, wiping a tear away.</p><p>\t\u201cHmm?\u201d He leaned in closer, an anxious look on his face.</p><p>\t\u201cI love you too, can you get down?\u201d She asked, smiling at him.</p><p>\tHarry sat down on her notebooks. \u00a0He handed her the bouquet he\u2019d been holding, smiling shyly.</p><p>\t\u201cI miss you so much,\u201d he mumbled, finally noticing how everyone was watching with rapt attention.</p><p>\t\u201cI miss you too,\u201d she nodded, hugging the flowers to her chest.</p><p>\tBecks stood up and kissed him, making everyone begin to applaud wildly. \u00a0Her cheeks burned as she buried her face against his neck. \u00a0Harry placed his hands on the small of her back, pressing kisses to the top of her head.</p><p>\t\u201cI am so sorry,\u201d he sighed. \u201cMore than I can say. I love you and your books and flashcards and all of it.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI love you too,\u201d she murmured, picking her head up as the clapping subsided.</p><p>\t\u201cYou wanna sleep over tonight?\u201d He asked, pulling her closer.</p><p>\t\u201cLet\u2019s sleep at mine,\u201d she suggested, indicating the flowers. \u201cI should put these in water.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cRight,\u201d he agreed, picking up her things and shouldering her backpack. \u201cOh, and Kennedy?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYeah?\u201d Kennedy tried to stop smiling at the cuteness.</p><p>\t\u201cPlease still have the formal, I think Niall\u2019s experiencing clinical depression over it,\u201d he grinned.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do,\u201d she nodded.</p><p>\t\u201cYou and I aren\u2019t going,\u201d Harry told Becks as they walked out of the library.</p><p>\t\u201cWhy?\u201d She frowned.</p><p>\t\u201cBecause we won\u2019t be here that weekend,\u201d he shook his head. \u201cOur flight leaves after your Friday lab, and we get back Sunday around eleven at night. Don\u2019t worry about being tired for your Monday morning lit class, I talked to your professor and she was going to cancel that class anyways.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cReally?\u201d She smiled widely.</p><p>\t\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t miss stuff if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d he shrugged, holding her hand tightly. \u201cAnd I checked with all of your other professors, you haven\u2019t got any tests or papers due the week we\u2019re back, so you shouldn\u2019t have too much homework.\u201d</p><p>\tShe stopped and kissed him. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI love you like Niall loves Kappa,\u201d he grinned.</p><p>\t\u201cShut up,\u201d she rolled her eyes.</p><p>\t\u201cIn all seriousness,\u201d Harry cleared his throat. \u201cI fucked up and I want to make it up to you. Whatever it takes.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou don\u2019t have to make it up to me,\u201d she shook her head, unlocking her door.</p><p>\t\u201cI can try,\u201d he grinned, putting the flowers down. \u201cNow c\u2019mere, it\u2019s been a lonely six days.\u201d</p><hr><p><b>a/n: would like to take this time to say that i\u2019m v v v saddened by the fact that none of my readers likened the title of my last harry one shot (holiday in the sun) to mary kate and ashley\u2019s second most iconic film</b></p><p><b>ok hope you enjoyed</b></p>",

Besides, I like school.\u201d</p><p>\tHarry looked up at her. \u201c<i>Beck!</i> Come on. You like school more than me?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cSchool doesn\u2019t snore,\u201d she retorted.</p><p>\tHe quickly got on top of her, sitting on her hips. \u201cSchool doesn\u2019t do this either, does it?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cSquish me? It definitely feels like it sometimes,\u201d she said, refusing to play along just yet.</p><p>\t\u201cNot squish you,\u201d he mumbled, bending over and kissing her neck. \u00a0</p><p>\tHe ran his hands down her bare sides, hearing her breath catch in her chest as his mouth went lower and lower.</p><p>\t\u201cHmm?\u201d He pressed.</p><p>\t\u201cMhm, Harry,\u201d she moaned, before sitting up and throwing him off his balance. \u201cStill not skipping.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re so weird,\u201d he groaned, lying on his back and sadly staring at his growing erection. \u201cWho <i>wants</i> to go to class?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cMe,\u201d she said, finding her shirt on the floor.</p><p>\t\u201cThis is why you should join a sorority. Then you\u2019d have pledges to do your school stuff for you. And you could spend more time with me,\u201d he grinned, watching her get dressed.</p><p>\t\u201cNo thanks,\u201d she shook her head. \u201cHave you seen my underwear?\u201d</p><p>\tHarry dangled it from his middle finger. \u201cGot to come over here to get it back.\u201d</p><p>\tBecks tried to grab it, but he held it behind him. \u00a0Leaning to get it, he pulled her down on top of him. </p><p>\t\u201cHarry, come on,\u201d she sighed.</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re no fun this morning,\u201d he complained.</p><p>\t\u201cFine,\u201d she sat up. \u201cGuess I\u2019m not wearing underwear today.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cReally unfair to leave me with that visual!\u201d He yelled after her.</p><p>\tBecks quietly walked down the hallway of the frat house, which was still quiet at this hour. \u00a0Niall Horan unexpectedly popped out of his bedroom, trying to button up his shirt and walk at the same time.</p><p>\t\u201cMorning Becks,\u201d he waved.</p><p>\t\u201cHi,\u201d she smiled.</p><p>\t\u201cComing to the party tonight?\u201d Niall asked.</p><p>\t\u201cOh, I forgot about that,\u201d she frowned.</p><p>\t\u201cAll the Kappa girls are too,\u201d Niall said. \u201cC\u2019mon, you have to. Harry\u2019ll be all sad and mopey if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\tBecks blushed. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll text Kennedy. What\u2019s the theme?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cMathletes and Athletes,\u201d he grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be awesome.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d she said. \u201cHave a good day.\u201d</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>Becks really wasn\u2019t envious of her friends outfits as she sat down with them in the dining hall. \u00a0There was some event that their sorority was partaking in this afternoon, and that meant wearing letters. \u00a0Their nauseating pastel shirts were adorned with Kappa\u2019s Greek letters in neon Lilly Pulitzer prints.</p><p>\tThe next time Harry suggested she join the sorority, Becks was going to direct him to one of those shirts. \u00a0She would never be caught dead in Lilly Pulitzer, that was for sure. \u00a0</p><p>\tIt was kind of funny that she\u2019d fallen in with the sorority, given her disdain for Greek life. \u00a0It was doubly funny that her boyfriend was the stereotypical frat boy. \u00a0But she didn\u2019t make fun of Greek life too much, because without it she wouldn\u2019t have met the girls, or Harry.</p><p>\tBecks had been late for a class freshman year, after missing orientation due to a water skiing accident, and accidentally wandered into the Kappa sorority house while looking for U.S. history. \u00a0To this day, she maintained that it wasn\u2019t her fault. \u00a0All of the old buildings on campus looked just like the sorority and fraternity houses.</p><p>\tKennedy had been in the process of telling Becks that she was a stalker who needed to get out when she noticed the shoes Becks had been wearing.</p><p>\tAt any other college, Becks would have been the cool girl. \u00a0She had an amazing wardrobe, cool connections, and she was beautiful. \u00a0But here, at a college where Greek life was more important than anything else, she was a social reject.</p><p>\tWhen Kennedy noticed her shoes, which had only been made for the Saint Laurent Spring/Summer runway and were impossible to find, they had formed a fast friendship. \u00a0What started as a materialistic connection turned into a genuine bond, and with Kennedy\u2019s approval Becks fell in with the Kappa girls.</p><p>\t\u201cAlright, what\u2019s everyone wearing tonight?\u201d Kennedy clapped her hands from the head of the table.</p><p>\t\u201cSomething slutty,\u201d was the response she got from most girls.</p><p>\t\u201cAnd you, my dear Beckett?\u201d Kennedy smiled at Becks.</p><p>\t\u201cPuh-lease do not call me that,\u201d Becks rolled her eyes. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll just wear a button down with glasses and be a Mathlete.\u201d</p><p>\tThe rest of the girls seemed saddened by her inability to see how important outfit choices were at a frat party.</p><p>\t\u201cNo, you will wear something tight fitting with glasses,\u201d Kennedy corrected her.</p><p>\t\u201cWhy? I have a boyfriend. He\u2019s stuck with me, he knows what I\u2019m working with whether my shirt is tight or not,\u201d Becks groaned. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to go, I\u2019m so tired.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cMaybe if you would let our pledges take your notes, you could skip class and take a nap,\u201d Priscilla suggested. \u201cAs we\u2019ve already told you a million times.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t want someone else\u2019s notes,\u201d Becks insisted. \u201cI can take my own.\u201d</p><p>\tIf Harry knew that she was completely able to get notes and could skip class more often to hang out with him, he would be rather annoyed. \u00a0Not so much because she wasn\u2019t spending time with him, but because she was lying.</p><p>\tHe just didn\u2019t get it. \u00a0Becks <i>liked</i> school. \u00a0She liked sitting in lectures, taking notes, and writing papers. \u00a0Not that it was exactly good old fashioned fun, but it was a part of college. \u00a0And she didn\u2019t mind one bit. \u00a0If she tried to tell her boyfriend, the king of skipping classes, how she felt, he would probably want her tested for illness.</p><p>\t\u201cEveryone will meet tonight in the house living room to pregame at 9,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cThat includes you, Becks.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m going to go get some homework done before the weekend,\u201d Becks said, standing up. \u201cSee you tonight.\u201d</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>Adjusting her tight, white dress, Becks inspected herself in the mirror. \u00a0Little buttons went down the middle of the dress all the way to the bottom, kind of like a button up shirt. \u00a0She wore her thick-rimmed black glasses, which were really only for reading the white boards in class. \u00a0Her hair was up in a bun, and she was ready to go.</p><p>\tShe really wished she could skip the party and go to the end of the night, which would mean getting into bed with Harry. \u00a0But the party would be fun. \u00a0Probably.</p><p>\tThe Kappa girls greeted her warmly when she arrived at the pregame, taking the cup someone handed her. \u00a0Sitting down on the couch, she looked at the messages she\u2019d gotten from Harry on her walk here.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"710\" data-orig-width=\"400\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c18841281dd31c2acb29084a2d3137f1/tumblr_inline_pc7uu1G6PX1ulp6w2_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"710\" data-orig-width=\"400\"></figure><p>\tShe put her phone away, her lack of response sure to drive him insane. \u00a0Instead she focused on the girls, who were discussing some fundraiser that involved washing cars in bikinis. \u00a0Becks didn\u2019t even wash her own car, she couldn\u2019t imagine washing a stranger\u2019s in one of her swimsuits.</p><p>\tThe girls were all giggling and shrieking by the time they arrived at the frat house. \u00a0Inside they found an already massive crowd dressed in a mixture of athletic jerseys and sweater vests. \u00a0Harry was very easy to spot, standing up on a couch in his basketball jersey and snapback. \u00a0Becks winced when Liam Payne threw a beer at his chest, which he caught in the nick of time.</p><p>\tHe jumped off the couch when he saw her, pushing through the crowds until he was at her side. \u00a0Harry was one of the most popular people on campus, yet he seemed to have no idea. \u00a0He\u2019d give polite waves and smiles as he passed, not seeming to realize that all eyes were on him.</p><p>\t\u201cHi,\u201d he said, giving Becks a kiss. \u201cHi girls, let me steal her for a bit.\u201d</p><p>\tKennedy and Priscilla rolled her eyes, knowing full well that they wouldn\u2019t be seeing Becks until tomorrow.</p><p>\t\u201cMissed you,\u201d she smiled at him, wrapping her arms around his neck.</p><p>\t\u201cNot enough to cuddle with me this morning,\u201d he mumbled, tugging on her lower lip. \u201cMy pretty girl. Hey, I got us something cool.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cIs this going to be another vibrator?\u201d She raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\t\u201cDon\u2019t give me that face, you liked it,\u201d he scoffed. \u201cAnd no, even better. C\u2019mere.\u201d</p><p>\tBecks followed Harry upstairs to his room. \u00a0He happily picked up some papers from his printer and handed them to her with a proud smile.</p><p>\t\u201cPlane ticket?\u201d She scanned the sheet in her hands. \u201cYou\u2019re going away this Wednesday?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNope,\u201d he shook his head. \u201cWe both are.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cHarry!\u201d Her smile turned into a frown when she saw the dates. \u201cBut\u2026 I\u2019d be missing four days of class. Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and not getting back in until Monday afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cBeck,\u201d Harry said, his shoulders tensing. \u201cI\u2019m taking you on vacation and that\u2019s your first thought? School?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNo, my first thought is that it\u2019s so sweet of you,\u201d she shook her head. \u201cBut that\u2019s a lot of class to miss.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhy are you so obsessed with school?\u201d He groaned, flopping back onto his bed.</p><p>\t\u201cBecause I\u2019m a student?\u201d She tried.</p><p>\t\u201cCan you just let me do one nice fucking thing?\u201d Harry snapped.</p><p>\tHer mouth opened, because she hadn\u2019t expected him to get so angry so quickly. \u00a0Harry\u2019s mom worked for a prominent travel magazine, so she knew he probably got these tickets through her. \u00a0And it was so sweet and thoughtful, but she wished he had checked with her before he took them. \u00a0She had a test on Thursday, and her lab on Friday. \u00a0There was just no way she could miss this much work without her grades severely suffering.</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re some fucking scholarship kid,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou\u2019re not losing anything by not going to class for once in your life. What, are you scared someone will take your seat in the front row?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cDon\u2019t be mean,\u201d she said, toeing the ground with her sandals.</p><p>\t\u201cFine, I\u2019m mean, but you\u2019re just ridiculous,\u201d he huffed. \u201cI\u2019m trying to show you how serious I am about you, and about us, and you\u2019re just complaining about stupid shit.\u201d</p><p>\tBecks rolled her eyes at that. \u201cIf you want to show me how serious you are, stop swearing at me and having a fit.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cFine, I\u2019ll go by myself,\u201d Harry snapped, standing up. \u201cHave fun sitting through lectures that you\u2019ll never need again once you graduate!\u201d</p><p>\tShe winced as he slammed his bedroom door behind him, leaving her with the tickets and travel roster. \u00a0Gently placing them on his desk, she sucked her lower lip into her mouth. \u00a0Why did he have to get so worked up over this? \u00a0She could understand that he was disappointed, but he didn\u2019t need to be so mean.</p><p>\tSighing, she walked downstairs and back into the party. \u00a0She knew she should have skipped this. \u00a0Refreshing her drink, she decided that maybe she should try and talk to Harry just once more. \u00a0If he wasn\u2019t having it, they could talk tomorrow, but she would have preferred to go to sleep with him tonight knowing that they were okay.</p><p>\tHarry was tall, so it was easy to spot him at the beer pong table. \u00a0He and Liam were playing against Niall and Louis Tomlinson. \u00a0Harry held his hat to his head, as if he were afraid the backwards cap were going to fall off. \u00a0Standing in the gathered audience, Becks decided to wait until the game was through to say anything.</p><p>\tBut in her sandals she was short, so Harry had no idea his girlfriend was within earshot as he ranted to his friends and the small audience.</p><p>\t\u201cWhy\u2019s she like school so much? Like, who gives a fuck?\u201d Harry huffed. \u201cJust miss a few stupid classes to hang out with your boyfriend. She\u2019s such a freak sometimes, and not in the way I like her to be.\u201d</p><p>\tNiall snorted and rolled his eyes, as Becks\u2019 stomach dropped. \u201cNone of us are concerned with that aspect. We all hear you two just about every damn night, Harry. Or should I say <i>Daddy?</i>\u201d</p><p>\tBecks\u2019 cheeks burned with humiliation, but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to walk away or speak up.</p><p>\t\u201cAs least someone\u2019s calling me something,\u201d Harry rolled his eyes.</p><p>\t\u201cShe is really obsessed with school, it\u2019s weird,\u201d Liam agreed. \u201cWhy won\u2019t she just join Kappa?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWon\u2019t get off her fuckin\u2019 high horse,\u201d Harry muttered, drinking from a cup even though it wasn\u2019t his turn. \u201cShe really knows how to get on my nerves. Trying to show her I can be a good boyfriend and this is what I get.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cCan I come?\u201d Louis asked. \u201cInstead of Becks?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cSure, why not? You know what, why don\u2019t you and Eleanor just take the tickets? Like I give a fuck. I might as well be here with the weirdo listening to stories about professors and papers,\u201d Harry sighed dramatically.</p><p>\t<i>Weirdo?</i> \u00a0Becks\u2019 jaw clenched. \u00a0She could tell from the unfocused look in Harry\u2019s green eyes that he was drunk, but that was no excuse. \u00a0They had one little disagreement, and here he was telling anyone within earshot about how strange she was.</p><p>\t\u201cSo break up with her,\u201d Liam shrugged.</p><p>\tHarry paused, and the pause broke her heart. \u201cNah, probably not.\u201d</p><p>\tShe had heard enough. \u00a0Turning on her heel, she pulled her glasses off and walked through the crowd as tears streaked down her cheeks. \u00a0Being a good student wasn\u2019t a crime, at least, it shouldn\u2019t be. \u00a0But maybe in the world of Harry Styles where solo cups were textbooks and coming up with lies to get out of things were essays, it was.</p><p>\t\u201cShit!\u201d She heard Harry yell, and she quickened her pace.</p><p>\tShe was not going to cry in front of him, and she wasn\u2019t going to get into an argument in front of the entire party.</p><p>\t\u201cBeck, Becks!\u201d Harry panted, running after her. \u201cPlease wait up baby, please.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOh, so now I\u2019m your baby?\u201d She couldn\u2019t help it, turning around and putting her hands on her hips.</p><p>\t\u201cN-no, don\u2019t cry,\u201d he said, reaching forward to dry her tears.</p><p>\tShe smacked his hand away. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>\tHarry sighed heavily. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean any of that, I never would have\u2026\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhat? Never would have said it if you knew I was there? Would have waited until later when I was out of earshot?\u201d She supplied some possible answers for him.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2026\u201d Harry wasn\u2019t used to being put on the spot.</p><p>\t\u201cI had no idea it was so difficult for you to be around me,\u201d she said quietly, aware that everyone was listening. \u201cMaybe you should stay away to help yourself feel better.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNo, no,\u201d he shook his head.</p><p>\t\u201cSome boyfriend,\u201d she said under her breath, walking away before he had the chance to come up with something.</p><p>\tShe walked and walked, until she found herself back in her own room. \u00a0Pulling the dress off, she got into her pajamas as she continued to sob. \u00a0But her pajamas were an old t-shirt and boxers of Harry\u2019s, so she ripped those off and got into bed naked.</p><p>\tShe and Harry were different, and that was why they worked. \u00a0Or so she thought. \u00a0He was the crazy frat boy, and she was the good girl. \u00a0In some ways they made no sense, yet they meshed together perfectly.</p><p>\tHearing him complain about her to anyone willing to listen hurt more than she could have imagined. \u00a0His words were ringing in her ears, no matter how hard she tried to block them out. \u00a0So she stuck her headphones in and fell asleep listening to breakup songs.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>\u201cBaby? Please open the door, I know you\u2019re in there,\u201d Harry groaned, leaning his forehead against her door.</p><p>\tBecks sat silently at her little kitchen table, working through a calculus problem. \u00a0He\u2019d been out there for approximately thirteen minutes. \u00a0They were on day four of not speaking, mostly because of her. \u00a0He didn\u2019t call or text her until two days after the incident, and she ignored him. \u00a0He kept texting and calling before switching to house calls. \u00a0But she hadn\u2019t let him in, she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\tShe felt like their entire two year relationship had been a lie. \u00a0They\u2019d had their ups and downs, but nothing had ever been as hurtful as this. \u00a0She found herself wondering if maybe Harry was only with her as some sort of extended joke.</p><p>\t\u201cPlease?\u201d His voice wobbled, and she held her face in her hands. \u201cI miss you Becks, come on. Can you just talk to me?\u201d</p><p>\tShe cried silently, closing her textbook. \u00a0Getting work done was impossible when she was so completely miserable.</p><p>\t\u201cFine,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cI\u2019ll try again tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\tBecks cried loudly once he was gone. \u00a0She didn\u2019t know what to do. \u00a0Talking about it was terrifying, but she couldn\u2019t ignore him forever. \u00a0He was still her boyfriend, even if he\u2019d fucked up like this.</p><p>\tKennedy had demanded her presence at dinner in the dining hall, so Becks set to icing her puffy, red eyes and picking out a outfit that had casual yes-I\u2019m-fine undertones. \u00a0Sighing, she said a quick prayer that Harry would be eating at the frat house.</p><p>\tWhen Becks approached the usual Kappa table, she found Niall Horan on his knees at Kennedy\u2019s feet. \u00a0Briefly forgetting her own problems, she sat down next to Della.</p><p>\t\u201cPlease, you can\u2019t cancel,\u201d Niall moaned. \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite day of the year.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOh, sorry Niall,\u201d Kennedy mock pouted. \u201cBut Kappa will no longer be fraternizing with you boys. I heard the Alpha Phi girls are free, though. Probably because of that herpes outbreak, but you\u2019ve got to take what you can get.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cHe\u2019s sorry, he\u2019s so sorry,\u201d Niall insisted, grabbing her hands. \u201cYou can\u2019t cancel the date party.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cToo late,\u201d Kennedy said, shaking him off.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Becks asked Della.</p><p>\tDella smiled at her. \u201cWe decided that we won\u2019t be involved with them anymore. Kennedy told us what Harry was saying, that sucks.\u201d</p><p>\tBecks\u2019 cheeks turned red when she realized she was causing the chasm between the two groups. \u00a0On one hand she felt embarrassed, but on the other she hoped Harry was getting all of the blame for this.</p><p>\t\u201cWe\u2019ll kick him out of the frat,\u201d Niall said firmly. \u201cJust say the word, he\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWell?\u201d Kennedy raised an eyebrow, looking at Becks.</p><p>\t\u201cNo!\u201d Becks shook her head rapidly. \u201cYou can\u2019t kick him out, that\u2019s insane. Just have the stupid date party.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhat she said!\u201d Niall nodded.</p><p>\t\u201cShe\u2019s nice,\u201d Kennedy frowned. \u201cI\u2019m not. Maybe you\u2019ll remember this when you\u2019re recruiting next year.\u201d</p><p>\tNiall finally gave up, glaring at the table Harry was at as he left the dining hall. \u201cHey man, fuck you!\u201d</p><p>\tBecks slouched lower in her seat, hoping that nobody knew what was going on and that it all revolved around her.</p><p>\t\u201cYou can have the party,\u201d she said quietly, looking at Kennedy.</p><p>\t\u201cNo, we can\u2019t,\u201d Kennedy said firmly. \u201cThey\u2019re clearly not up to par if that\u2019s how they talk about people. It wasn\u2019t just Harry, it was his friends. And Niall Horan kind of creeps me out, anyways.\u201d</p><p>\tPriscilla, who frequently hooked up with Niall, rolled her eyes at that.</p><p>\t\u201cSo what are you doing if you\u2019re not having the party?\u201d Becks asked. \u201cDon\u2019t you have the place rented out and stuff?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d Della frowned.</p><p>\t\u201cOh my God, I know!\u201d Kennedy clapped her hands suddenly. \u201cMakeover party!\u201d</p><p>\tBecks winced, but the other girls all seemed thrilled at the prospect. \u00a0Everyone began calling her favorite salon to request their stylists for the night, giggling to one another as they were put on hold.</p><p>\t\u201cAnd obviously you\u2019re coming,\u201d Kennedy said.</p><p>\tBecks pretended not to hear.</p><p>\t\u201cBeckett, hello?\u201d Kennedy said louder.</p><p>\t\u201cOh my God, stop,\u201d Becks huffed. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI hope the bar lets us have a makeover party,\u201d Kennedy frowned. \u201cOh well, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\tBecks ate some of her salad as the girls planned. \u00a0She figured that even if she was losing her boyfriend, she still had some pretty amazing friends.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhy do you even come to the library?\u201d Priscilla asked. \u201cYou get straight A\u2019s even if you don\u2019t study.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cJust wanted a change of scenery,\u201d Becks mumbled.</p><p>\tShe was seated at the Kappa table in the library, which was currently full of sorority sisters cramming for their midterms. \u00a0Not that Becks needed to fit any more studying in, but staying in her own room was a hazard. \u00a0Harry was constantly trying to talk to her, so she needed some peace and quiet. \u00a0Unfortunately, that meant sitting in the library.</p><p>\t\u201cOh my God,\u201d Della whispered. \u201cLook.\u201d</p><p>\tBecks didn\u2019t bother looking up. \u00a0She didn\u2019t want to gossip or people watch. \u00a0She just wanted to get a head start on her reading, go to bed, and hopefully not cry tonight. \u00a0It had now been six days since she spoke to Harry. \u00a0She thought that it would get easier, but it didn\u2019t. \u00a0It was still just as heartbreaking as it had been in that moment.</p><p>\t\u201cLook!\u201d Kennedy pinched her thigh, making her jump.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat?\u201d Becks hissed.</p><p>\tKennedy nodded at the entrance. \u00a0The girls always sat on the third floor of the library, because everyone knew that was the cool area. \u00a0It was the best place for people watching, and the Starbucks was on this floor.</p><p>\tHarry was walking in, carrying a bouquet of flowers and wearing a flannel. \u00a0In other words, dressed up more so than usual. \u00a0Running a hand through his hair, his eyes locked with hers.</p><p>\t\u201cGood evening, ladies,\u201d he said, approaching the table.</p><p>\t\u201cWalk away,\u201d Kennedy said, leaning back in her seat and crossing her arms over her chest.</p><p>\t\u201cDon\u2019t think so,\u201d he said, giving her an annoying little smile as he stepped up onto the table. \u201cUh, excuse me? Can I have everyone\u2019s attention?\u201d</p><p>\tHad anyone else stepped on a table in the middle of the library and demanded everyone\u2019s consideration, they would have been laughed out of the building. \u00a0But it was Harry, so people stopped what they were doing and listened.</p><p>\t\u201cSo last week, I really hurt my girlfriend\u2019s feelings at a party. I was trying to do something nice, but I didn\u2019t really ask her about her opinion on the matter and I got really frustrated and screamed at her,\u201d Harry sighed, not even blushing under all of the eyes on him.</p><p>\tBecks stared up at him with wide eyes, unable to believe this was happening.</p><p>\t\u201cAnd after that I got really drunk, and I was telling anyone who would listen all sorts of lies to make myself feel better about fucking up. I thought she\u2019d left, but she was there and she heard. Hi, Beck, how\u2019s it going?\u201d He smiled down at her, seeming to forget where he was for a moment.</p><p>\t\u201cHi,\u201d she whispered, hands shaking as she held her book.</p><p>\t\u201cNow you won\u2019t talk to me. You ignore me when I knock at your door, and all of your friends are ignoring me too. And I\u2026 I can\u2019t lose you. I don\u2019t want to go back to life without you,\u201d he shook his head.</p><p>\tSeveral girls let out <i>awww</i>\u2019s at that.</p><p>\t\u201cI love you more than anything. I love you as much as you love school. Which is fine, there\u2019s nothing wrong with loving school. Someone\u2019s got to, I suppose,\u201d he said, giving her a tiny smile. \u201cAnd I shouldn\u2019t make fun of you, or anyone else, to make myself feel better. I should never have jeopardized our relationship. I know that now.\u201d</p><p>\tHer eyes were tearing now, because it was like he\u2019d somehow read her mind and figured out everything she wanted to hear in an apology.</p><p>\t\u201cPlease just talk to me,\u201d he begged, getting down on his knees so he was nearly at her level. \u201cI miss you so much, and I love you.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cHarry,\u201d she sniffled, wiping a tear away.</p><p>\t\u201cHmm?\u201d He leaned in closer, an anxious look on his face.</p><p>\t\u201cI love you too, can you get down?\u201d She asked, smiling at him.</p><p>\tHarry sat down on her notebooks. \u00a0He handed her the bouquet he\u2019d been holding, smiling shyly.</p><p>\t\u201cI miss you so much,\u201d he mumbled, finally noticing how everyone was watching with rapt attention.</p><p>\t\u201cI miss you too,\u201d she nodded, hugging the flowers to her chest.</p><p>\tBecks stood up and kissed him, making everyone begin to applaud wildly. \u00a0Her cheeks burned as she buried her face against his neck. \u00a0Harry placed his hands on the small of her back, pressing kisses to the top of her head.</p><p>\t\u201cI am so sorry,\u201d he sighed. \u201cMore than I can say. I love you and your books and flashcards and all of it.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI love you too,\u201d she murmured, picking her head up as the clapping subsided.</p><p>\t\u201cYou wanna sleep over tonight?\u201d He asked, pulling her closer.</p><p>\t\u201cLet\u2019s sleep at mine,\u201d she suggested, indicating the flowers. \u201cI should put these in water.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cRight,\u201d he agreed, picking up her things and shouldering her backpack. \u201cOh, and Kennedy?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYeah?\u201d Kennedy tried to stop smiling at the cuteness.</p><p>\t\u201cPlease still have the formal, I think Niall\u2019s experiencing clinical depression over it,\u201d he grinned.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do,\u201d she nodded.</p><p>\t\u201cYou and I aren\u2019t going,\u201d Harry told Becks as they walked out of the library.</p><p>\t\u201cWhy?\u201d She frowned.</p><p>\t\u201cBecause we won\u2019t be here that weekend,\u201d he shook his head. \u201cOur flight leaves after your Friday lab, and we get back Sunday around eleven at night. Don\u2019t worry about being tired for your Monday morning lit class, I talked to your professor and she was going to cancel that class anyways.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cReally?\u201d She smiled widely.</p><p>\t\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t miss stuff if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d he shrugged, holding her hand tightly. \u201cAnd I checked with all of your other professors, you haven\u2019t got any tests or papers due the week we\u2019re back, so you shouldn\u2019t have too much homework.\u201d</p><p>\tShe stopped and kissed him. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI love you like Niall loves Kappa,\u201d he grinned.</p><p>\t\u201cShut up,\u201d she rolled her eyes.</p><p>\t\u201cIn all seriousness,\u201d Harry cleared his throat. \u201cI fucked up and I want to make it up to you. Whatever it takes.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou don\u2019t have to make it up to me,\u201d she shook her head, unlocking her door.</p><p>\t\u201cI can try,\u201d he grinned, putting the flowers down. \u201cNow c\u2019mere, it\u2019s been a lonely six days.\u201d</p><hr><p><b>a/n: would like to take this time to say that i\u2019m v v v saddened by the fact that none of my readers likened the title of my last harry one shot (holiday in the sun) to mary kate and ashley\u2019s second most iconic film</b></p><p><b>ok hope you enjoyed</b></p>",

It definitely feels like it sometimes,&rdquo; she said, refusing to play along just yet.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Not squish you,&rdquo; he mumbled, bending over and kissing her neck. &nbsp;</p><p>\tHe ran his hands down her bare sides, hearing her breath catch in her chest as his mouth went lower and lower.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo; He pressed.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Mhm, Harry,&rdquo; she moaned, before sitting up and throwing him off his balance. &ldquo;Still not skipping.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so weird,&rdquo; he groaned, lying on his back and sadly staring at his growing erection. &ldquo;Who <i>wants</i> to go to class?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Me,&rdquo; she said, finding her shirt on the floor.</p><p>\t&ldquo;This is why you should join a sorority. Then you&rsquo;d have pledges to do your school stuff for you. And you could spend more time with me,&rdquo; he grinned, watching her get dressed.</p><p>\t&ldquo;No thanks,&rdquo; she shook her head. &ldquo;Have you seen my underwear?&rdquo;</p><p>\tHarry dangled it from his middle finger. &ldquo;Got to come over here to get it back.&rdquo;</p><p>\tBecks tried to grab it, but he held it behind him. &nbsp;Leaning to get it, he pulled her down on top of him. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Harry, come on,&rdquo; she sighed.</p><p>\t&ldquo;You&rsquo;re no fun this morning,&rdquo; he complained.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; she sat up. &ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;m not wearing underwear today.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Really unfair to leave me with that visual!&rdquo; He yelled after her.</p><p>\tBecks quietly walked down the hallway of the frat house, which was still quiet at this hour. &nbsp;Niall Horan unexpectedly popped out of his bedroom, trying to button up his shirt and walk at the same time.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Morning Becks,&rdquo; he waved.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; she smiled.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Coming to the party tonight?&rdquo; Niall asked.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh, I forgot about that,&rdquo; she frowned.</p><p>\t&ldquo;All the Kappa girls are too,&rdquo; Niall said. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, you have to. Harry&rsquo;ll be all sad and mopey if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>\tBecks blushed. &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;ll text Kennedy. What&rsquo;s the theme?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Mathletes and Athletes,&rdquo; he grinned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gonna be awesome.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep that in mind,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Have a good day.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>Becks really wasn&rsquo;t envious of her friends outfits as she sat down with them in the dining hall. &nbsp;There was some event that their sorority was partaking in this afternoon, and that meant wearing letters. &nbsp;Their nauseating pastel shirts were adorned with Kappa&rsquo;s Greek letters in neon Lilly Pulitzer prints.</p><p>\tThe next time Harry suggested she join the sorority, Becks was going to direct him to one of those shirts. &nbsp;She would never be caught dead in Lilly Pulitzer, that was for sure. &nbsp;</p><p>\tIt was kind of funny that she&rsquo;d fallen in with the sorority, given her disdain for Greek life. &nbsp;It was doubly funny that her boyfriend was the stereotypical frat boy. &nbsp;But she didn&rsquo;t make fun of Greek life too much, because without it she wouldn&rsquo;t have met the girls, or Harry.</p><p>\tBecks had been late for a class freshman year, after missing orientation due to a water skiing accident, and accidentally wandered into the Kappa sorority house while looking for U.S. history. &nbsp;To this day, she maintained that it wasn&rsquo;t her fault. &nbsp;All of the old buildings on campus looked just like the sorority and fraternity houses.</p><p>\tKennedy had been in the process of telling Becks that she was a stalker who needed to get out when she noticed the shoes Becks had been wearing.</p><p>\tAt any other college, Becks would have been the cool girl. &nbsp;She had an amazing wardrobe, cool connections, and she was beautiful. &nbsp;But here, at a college where Greek life was more important than anything else, she was a social reject.</p><p>\tWhen Kennedy noticed her shoes, which had only been made for the Saint Laurent Spring/Summer runway and were impossible to find, they had formed a fast friendship. &nbsp;What started as a materialistic connection turned into a genuine bond, and with Kennedy&rsquo;s approval Becks fell in with the Kappa girls.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Alright, what&rsquo;s everyone wearing tonight?&rdquo; Kennedy clapped her hands from the head of the table.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Something slutty,&rdquo; was the response she got from most girls.</p><p>\t&ldquo;And you, my dear Beckett?&rdquo; Kennedy smiled at Becks.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Puh-lease do not call me that,&rdquo; Becks rolled her eyes. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ll just wear a button down with glasses and be a Mathlete.&rdquo;</p><p>\tThe rest of the girls seemed saddened by her inability to see how important outfit choices were at a frat party.</p><p>\t&ldquo;No, you will wear something tight fitting with glasses,&rdquo; Kennedy corrected her.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Why? I have a boyfriend. He&rsquo;s stuck with me, he knows what I&rsquo;m working with whether my shirt is tight or not,&rdquo; Becks groaned. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even want to go, I&rsquo;m so tired.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Maybe if you would let our pledges take your notes, you could skip class and take a nap,&rdquo; Priscilla suggested. &ldquo;As we&rsquo;ve already told you a million times.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want someone else&rsquo;s notes,&rdquo; Becks insisted. &ldquo;I can take my own.&rdquo;</p><p>\tIf Harry knew that she was completely able to get notes and could skip class more often to hang out with him, he would be rather annoyed. &nbsp;Not so much because she wasn&rsquo;t spending time with him, but because she was lying.</p><p>\tHe just didn&rsquo;t get it. &nbsp;Becks <i>liked</i> school. &nbsp;She liked sitting in lectures, taking notes, and writing papers. &nbsp;Not that it was exactly good old fashioned fun, but it was a part of college. &nbsp;And she didn&rsquo;t mind one bit. &nbsp;If she tried to tell her boyfriend, the king of skipping classes, how she felt, he would probably want her tested for illness.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Everyone will meet tonight in the house living room to pregame at 9,&rdquo; Kennedy said. &ldquo;That includes you, Becks.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go get some homework done before the weekend,&rdquo; Becks said, standing up. &ldquo;See you tonight.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>Adjusting her tight, white dress, Becks inspected herself in the mirror. &nbsp;Little buttons went down the middle of the dress all the way to the bottom, kind of like a button up shirt. &nbsp;She wore her thick-rimmed black glasses, which were really only for reading the white boards in class. &nbsp;Her hair was up in a bun, and she was ready to go.</p><p>\tShe really wished she could skip the party and go to the end of the night, which would mean getting into bed with Harry. &nbsp;But the party would be fun. &nbsp;Probably.</p><p>\tThe Kappa girls greeted her warmly when she arrived at the pregame, taking the cup someone handed her. &nbsp;Sitting down on the couch, she looked at the messages she&rsquo;d gotten from Harry on her walk here.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c18841281dd31c2acb29084a2d3137f1/tumblr_inline_pc7uu1G6PX1ulp6w2_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>\tShe put her phone away, her lack of response sure to drive him insane. &nbsp;Instead she focused on the girls, who were discussing some fundraiser that involved washing cars in bikinis. &nbsp;Becks didn&rsquo;t even wash her own car, she couldn&rsquo;t imagine washing a stranger&rsquo;s in one of her swimsuits.</p><p>\tThe girls were all giggling and shrieking by the time they arrived at the frat house. &nbsp;Inside they found an already massive crowd dressed in a mixture of athletic jerseys and sweater vests. &nbsp;Harry was very easy to spot, standing up on a couch in his basketball jersey and snapback. &nbsp;Becks winced when Liam Payne threw a beer at his chest, which he caught in the nick of time.</p><p>\tHe jumped off the couch when he saw her, pushing through the crowds until he was at her side. &nbsp;Harry was one of the most popular people on campus, yet he seemed to have no idea. &nbsp;He&rsquo;d give polite waves and smiles as he passed, not seeming to realize that all eyes were on him.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; he said, giving Becks a kiss. &ldquo;Hi girls, let me steal her for a bit.&rdquo;</p><p>\tKennedy and Priscilla rolled her eyes, knowing full well that they wouldn&rsquo;t be seeing Becks until tomorrow.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Missed you,&rdquo; she smiled at him, wrapping her arms around his neck.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Not enough to cuddle with me this morning,&rdquo; he mumbled, tugging on her lower lip. &ldquo;My pretty girl. Hey, I got us something cool.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Is this going to be another vibrator?&rdquo; She raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give me that face, you liked it,&rdquo; he scoffed. &ldquo;And no, even better. C&rsquo;mere.&rdquo;</p><p>\tBecks followed Harry upstairs to his room. &nbsp;He happily picked up some papers from his printer and handed them to her with a proud smile.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Plane ticket?&rdquo; She scanned the sheet in her hands. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going away this Wednesday?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; he shook his head. &ldquo;We both are.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Harry!&rdquo; Her smile turned into a frown when she saw the dates. &ldquo;But&hellip; I&rsquo;d be missing four days of class. Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and not getting back in until Monday afternoon.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Beck,&rdquo; Harry said, his shoulders tensing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking you on vacation and that&rsquo;s your first thought? School?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;No, my first thought is that it&rsquo;s so sweet of you,&rdquo; she shook her head. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s a lot of class to miss.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Why are you so obsessed with school?&rdquo; He groaned, flopping back onto his bed.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m a student?&rdquo; She tried.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Can you just let me do one nice fucking thing?&rdquo; Harry snapped.</p><p>\tHer mouth opened, because she hadn&rsquo;t expected him to get so angry so quickly. &nbsp;Harry&rsquo;s mom worked for a prominent travel magazine, so she knew he probably got these tickets through her. &nbsp;And it was so sweet and thoughtful, but she wished he had checked with her before he took them. &nbsp;She had a test on Thursday, and her lab on Friday. &nbsp;There was just no way she could miss this much work without her grades severely suffering.</p><p>\t&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re some fucking scholarship kid,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not losing anything by not going to class for once in your life. What, are you scared someone will take your seat in the front row?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be mean,&rdquo; she said, toeing the ground with her sandals.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Fine, I&rsquo;m mean, but you&rsquo;re just ridiculous,&rdquo; he huffed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to show you how serious I am about you, and about us, and you&rsquo;re just complaining about stupid shit.&rdquo;</p><p>\tBecks rolled her eyes at that. &ldquo;If you want to show me how serious you are, stop swearing at me and having a fit.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Fine, I&rsquo;ll go by myself,&rdquo; Harry snapped, standing up. &ldquo;Have fun sitting through lectures that you&rsquo;ll never need again once you graduate!&rdquo;</p><p>\tShe winced as he slammed his bedroom door behind him, leaving her with the tickets and travel roster. &nbsp;Gently placing them on his desk, she sucked her lower lip into her mouth. &nbsp;Why did he have to get so worked up over this? &nbsp;She could understand that he was disappointed, but he didn&rsquo;t need to be so mean.</p><p>\tSighing, she walked downstairs and back into the party. &nbsp;She knew she should have skipped this. &nbsp;Refreshing her drink, she decided that maybe she should try and talk to Harry just once more. &nbsp;If he wasn&rsquo;t having it, they could talk tomorrow, but she would have preferred to go to sleep with him tonight knowing that they were okay.</p><p>\tHarry was tall, so it was easy to spot him at the beer pong table. &nbsp;He and Liam were playing against Niall and Louis Tomlinson. &nbsp;Harry held his hat to his head, as if he were afraid the backwards cap were going to fall off. &nbsp;Standing in the gathered audience, Becks decided to wait until the game was through to say anything.</p><p>\tBut in her sandals she was short, so Harry had no idea his girlfriend was within earshot as he ranted to his friends and the small audience.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Why&rsquo;s she like school so much? Like, who gives a fuck?&rdquo; Harry huffed. &ldquo;Just miss a few stupid classes to hang out with your boyfriend. She&rsquo;s such a freak sometimes, and not in the way I like her to be.&rdquo;</p><p>\tNiall snorted and rolled his eyes, as Becks&rsquo; stomach dropped. &ldquo;None of us are concerned with that aspect. We all hear you two just about every damn night, Harry. Or should I say <i>Daddy?</i>&rdquo;</p><p>\tBecks&rsquo; cheeks burned with humiliation, but she couldn&rsquo;t bring herself to walk away or speak up.</p><p>\t&ldquo;As least someone&rsquo;s calling me something,&rdquo; Harry rolled his eyes.</p><p>\t&ldquo;She is really obsessed with school, it&rsquo;s weird,&rdquo; Liam agreed. &ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t she just join Kappa?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t get off her fuckin&rsquo; high horse,&rdquo; Harry muttered, drinking from a cup even though it wasn&rsquo;t his turn. &ldquo;She really knows how to get on my nerves. Trying to show her I can be a good boyfriend and this is what I get.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Can I come?&rdquo; Louis asked. &ldquo;Instead of Becks?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Sure, why not? You know what, why don&rsquo;t you and Eleanor just take the tickets? Like I give a fuck. I might as well be here with the weirdo listening to stories about professors and papers,&rdquo; Harry sighed dramatically.</p><p>\t<i>Weirdo?</i> &nbsp;Becks&rsquo; jaw clenched. &nbsp;She could tell from the unfocused look in Harry&rsquo;s green eyes that he was drunk, but that was no excuse. &nbsp;They had one little disagreement, and here he was telling anyone within earshot about how strange she was.</p><p>\t&ldquo;So break up with her,&rdquo; Liam shrugged.</p><p>\tHarry paused, and the pause broke her heart. &ldquo;Nah, probably not.&rdquo;</p><p>\tShe had heard enough. &nbsp;Turning on her heel, she pulled her glasses off and walked through the crowd as tears streaked down her cheeks. &nbsp;Being a good student wasn&rsquo;t a crime, at least, it shouldn&rsquo;t be. &nbsp;But maybe in the world of Harry Styles where solo cups were textbooks and coming up with lies to get out of things were essays, it was.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Shit!&rdquo; She heard Harry yell, and she quickened her pace.</p><p>\tShe was not going to cry in front of him, and she wasn&rsquo;t going to get into an argument in front of the entire party.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Beck, Becks!&rdquo; Harry panted, running after her. &ldquo;Please wait up baby, please.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh, so now I&rsquo;m your baby?&rdquo; She couldn&rsquo;t help it, turning around and putting her hands on her hips.</p><p>\t&ldquo;N-no, don&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; he said, reaching forward to dry her tears.</p><p>\tShe smacked his hand away. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch me.&rdquo;</p><p>\tHarry sighed heavily. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean any of that, I never would have&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;What? Never would have said it if you knew I was there? Would have waited until later when I was out of earshot?&rdquo; She supplied some possible answers for him.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Harry wasn&rsquo;t used to being put on the spot.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I had no idea it was so difficult for you to be around me,&rdquo; she said quietly, aware that everyone was listening. &ldquo;Maybe you should stay away to help yourself feel better.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he shook his head.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Some boyfriend,&rdquo; she said under her breath, walking away before he had the chance to come up with something.</p><p>\tShe walked and walked, until she found herself back in her own room. &nbsp;Pulling the dress off, she got into her pajamas as she continued to sob. &nbsp;But her pajamas were an old t-shirt and boxers of Harry&rsquo;s, so she ripped those off and got into bed naked.</p><p>\tShe and Harry were different, and that was why they worked. &nbsp;Or so she thought. &nbsp;He was the crazy frat boy, and she was the good girl. &nbsp;In some ways they made no sense, yet they meshed together perfectly.</p><p>\tHearing him complain about her to anyone willing to listen hurt more than she could have imagined. &nbsp;His words were ringing in her ears, no matter how hard she tried to block them out. &nbsp;So she stuck her headphones in and fell asleep listening to breakup songs.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Baby? Please open the door, I know you&rsquo;re in there,&rdquo; Harry groaned, leaning his forehead against her door.</p><p>\tBecks sat silently at her little kitchen table, working through a calculus problem. &nbsp;He&rsquo;d been out there for approximately thirteen minutes. &nbsp;They were on day four of not speaking, mostly because of her. &nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t call or text her until two days after the incident, and she ignored him. &nbsp;He kept texting and calling before switching to house calls. &nbsp;But she hadn&rsquo;t let him in, she couldn&rsquo;t.</p><p>\tShe felt like their entire two year relationship had been a lie. &nbsp;They&rsquo;d had their ups and downs, but nothing had ever been as hurtful as this. &nbsp;She found herself wondering if maybe Harry was only with her as some sort of extended joke.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Please?&rdquo; His voice wobbled, and she held her face in her hands. &ldquo;I miss you Becks, come on. Can you just talk to me?&rdquo;</p><p>\tShe cried silently, closing her textbook. &nbsp;Getting work done was impossible when she was so completely miserable.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try again tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p>\tBecks cried loudly once he was gone. &nbsp;She didn&rsquo;t know what to do. &nbsp;Talking about it was terrifying, but she couldn&rsquo;t ignore him forever. &nbsp;He was still her boyfriend, even if he&rsquo;d fucked up like this.</p><p>\tKennedy had demanded her presence at dinner in the dining hall, so Becks set to icing her puffy, red eyes and picking out a outfit that had casual yes-I&rsquo;m-fine undertones. &nbsp;Sighing, she said a quick prayer that Harry would be eating at the frat house.</p><p>\tWhen Becks approached the usual Kappa table, she found Niall Horan on his knees at Kennedy&rsquo;s feet. &nbsp;Briefly forgetting her own problems, she sat down next to Della.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Please, you can&rsquo;t cancel,&rdquo; Niall moaned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my favorite day of the year.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh, sorry Niall,&rdquo; Kennedy mock pouted. &ldquo;But Kappa will no longer be fraternizing with you boys. I heard the Alpha Phi girls are free, though. Probably because of that herpes outbreak, but you&rsquo;ve got to take what you can get.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;He&rsquo;s sorry, he&rsquo;s so sorry,&rdquo; Niall insisted, grabbing her hands. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t cancel the date party.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Too late,&rdquo; Kennedy said, shaking him off.</p><p>\t&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Becks asked Della.</p><p>\tDella smiled at her. &ldquo;We decided that we won&rsquo;t be involved with them anymore. Kennedy told us what Harry was saying, that sucks.&rdquo;</p><p>\tBecks&rsquo; cheeks turned red when she realized she was causing the chasm between the two groups. &nbsp;On one hand she felt embarrassed, but on the other she hoped Harry was getting all of the blame for this.</p><p>\t&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll kick him out of the frat,&rdquo; Niall said firmly. &ldquo;Just say the word, he&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Kennedy raised an eyebrow, looking at Becks.</p><p>\t&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Becks shook her head rapidly. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t kick him out, that&rsquo;s insane. Just have the stupid date party.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;What she said!&rdquo; Niall nodded.</p><p>\t&ldquo;She&rsquo;s nice,&rdquo; Kennedy frowned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not. Maybe you&rsquo;ll remember this when you&rsquo;re recruiting next year.&rdquo;</p><p>\tNiall finally gave up, glaring at the table Harry was at as he left the dining hall. &ldquo;Hey man, fuck you!&rdquo;</p><p>\tBecks slouched lower in her seat, hoping that nobody knew what was going on and that it all revolved around her.</p><p>\t&ldquo;You can have the party,&rdquo; she said quietly, looking at Kennedy.</p><p>\t&ldquo;No, we can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Kennedy said firmly. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re clearly not up to par if that&rsquo;s how they talk about people. It wasn&rsquo;t just Harry, it was his friends. And Niall Horan kind of creeps me out, anyways.&rdquo;</p><p>\tPriscilla, who frequently hooked up with Niall, rolled her eyes at that.</p><p>\t&ldquo;So what are you doing if you&rsquo;re not having the party?&rdquo; Becks asked. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have the place rented out and stuff?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;She&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Della frowned.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh my God, I know!&rdquo; Kennedy clapped her hands suddenly. &ldquo;Makeover party!&rdquo;</p><p>\tBecks winced, but the other girls all seemed thrilled at the prospect. &nbsp;Everyone began calling her favorite salon to request their stylists for the night, giggling to one another as they were put on hold.</p><p>\t&ldquo;And obviously you&rsquo;re coming,&rdquo; Kennedy said.</p><p>\tBecks pretended not to hear.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Beckett, hello?&rdquo; Kennedy said louder.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh my God, stop,&rdquo; Becks huffed. &ldquo;Fine.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I hope the bar lets us have a makeover party,&rdquo; Kennedy frowned. &ldquo;Oh well, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo;</p><p>\tBecks ate some of her salad as the girls planned. &nbsp;She figured that even if she was losing her boyfriend, she still had some pretty amazing friends.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why do you even come to the library?&rdquo; Priscilla asked. &ldquo;You get straight A&rsquo;s even if you don&rsquo;t study.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Just wanted a change of scenery,&rdquo; Becks mumbled.</p><p>\tShe was seated at the Kappa table in the library, which was currently full of sorority sisters cramming for their midterms. &nbsp;Not that Becks needed to fit any more studying in, but staying in her own room was a hazard. &nbsp;Harry was constantly trying to talk to her, so she needed some peace and quiet. &nbsp;Unfortunately, that meant sitting in the library.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh my God,&rdquo; Della whispered. &ldquo;Look.&rdquo;</p><p>\tBecks didn&rsquo;t bother looking up. &nbsp;She didn&rsquo;t want to gossip or people watch. &nbsp;She just wanted to get a head start on her reading, go to bed, and hopefully not cry tonight. &nbsp;It had now been six days since she spoke to Harry. &nbsp;She thought that it would get easier, but it didn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;It was still just as heartbreaking as it had been in that moment.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Kennedy pinched her thigh, making her jump.</p><p>\t&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Becks hissed.</p><p>\tKennedy nodded at the entrance. &nbsp;The girls always sat on the third floor of the library, because everyone knew that was the cool area. &nbsp;It was the best place for people watching, and the Starbucks was on this floor.</p><p>\tHarry was walking in, carrying a bouquet of flowers and wearing a flannel. &nbsp;In other words, dressed up more so than usual. &nbsp;Running a hand through his hair, his eyes locked with hers.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Good evening, ladies,&rdquo; he said, approaching the table.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Walk away,&rdquo; Kennedy said, leaning back in her seat and crossing her arms over her chest.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; he said, giving her an annoying little smile as he stepped up onto the table. &ldquo;Uh, excuse me? Can I have everyone&rsquo;s attention?&rdquo;</p><p>\tHad anyone else stepped on a table in the middle of the library and demanded everyone&rsquo;s consideration, they would have been laughed out of the building. &nbsp;But it was Harry, so people stopped what they were doing and listened.</p><p>\t&ldquo;So last week, I really hurt my girlfriend&rsquo;s feelings at a party. I was trying to do something nice, but I didn&rsquo;t really ask her about her opinion on the matter and I got really frustrated and screamed at her,&rdquo; Harry sighed, not even blushing under all of the eyes on him.</p><p>\tBecks stared up at him with wide eyes, unable to believe this was happening.</p><p>\t&ldquo;And after that I got really drunk, and I was telling anyone who would listen all sorts of lies to make myself feel better about fucking up. I thought she&rsquo;d left, but she was there and she heard. Hi, Beck, how&rsquo;s it going?&rdquo; He smiled down at her, seeming to forget where he was for a moment.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; she whispered, hands shaking as she held her book.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Now you won&rsquo;t talk to me. You ignore me when I knock at your door, and all of your friends are ignoring me too. And I&hellip; I can&rsquo;t lose you. I don&rsquo;t want to go back to life without you,&rdquo; he shook his head.</p><p>\tSeveral girls let out <i>awww</i>&rsquo;s at that.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I love you more than anything. I love you as much as you love school. Which is fine, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with loving school. Someone&rsquo;s got to, I suppose,&rdquo; he said, giving her a tiny smile. &ldquo;And I shouldn&rsquo;t make fun of you, or anyone else, to make myself feel better. I should never have jeopardized our relationship. I know that now.&rdquo;</p><p>\tHer eyes were tearing now, because it was like he&rsquo;d somehow read her mind and figured out everything she wanted to hear in an apology.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Please just talk to me,&rdquo; he begged, getting down on his knees so he was nearly at her level. &ldquo;I miss you so much, and I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Harry,&rdquo; she sniffled, wiping a tear away.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo; He leaned in closer, an anxious look on his face.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I love you too, can you get down?&rdquo; She asked, smiling at him.</p><p>\tHarry sat down on her notebooks. &nbsp;He handed her the bouquet he&rsquo;d been holding, smiling shyly.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I miss you so much,&rdquo; he mumbled, finally noticing how everyone was watching with rapt attention.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I miss you too,&rdquo; she nodded, hugging the flowers to her chest.</p><p>\tBecks stood up and kissed him, making everyone begin to applaud wildly. &nbsp;Her cheeks burned as she buried her face against his neck. &nbsp;Harry placed his hands on the small of her back, pressing kisses to the top of her head.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I am so sorry,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;More than I can say. I love you and your books and flashcards and all of it.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I love you too,&rdquo; she murmured, picking her head up as the clapping subsided.</p><p>\t&ldquo;You wanna sleep over tonight?&rdquo; He asked, pulling her closer.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sleep at mine,&rdquo; she suggested, indicating the flowers. &ldquo;I should put these in water.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; he agreed, picking up her things and shouldering her backpack. &ldquo;Oh, and Kennedy?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Kennedy tried to stop smiling at the cuteness.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Please still have the formal, I think Niall&rsquo;s experiencing clinical depression over it,&rdquo; he grinned.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what I can do,&rdquo; she nodded.</p><p>\t&ldquo;You and I aren&rsquo;t going,&rdquo; Harry told Becks as they walked out of the library.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; She frowned.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Because we won&rsquo;t be here that weekend,&rdquo; he shook his head. &ldquo;Our flight leaves after your Friday lab, and we get back Sunday around eleven at night. Don&rsquo;t worry about being tired for your Monday morning lit class, I talked to your professor and she was going to cancel that class anyways.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; She smiled widely.</p><p>\t&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t miss stuff if you don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; he shrugged, holding her hand tightly. &ldquo;And I checked with all of your other professors, you haven&rsquo;t got any tests or papers due the week we&rsquo;re back, so you shouldn&rsquo;t have too much homework.&rdquo;</p><p>\tShe stopped and kissed him. &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I love you like Niall loves Kappa,&rdquo; he grinned.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Shut up,&rdquo; she rolled her eyes.</p><p>\t&ldquo;In all seriousness,&rdquo; Harry cleared his throat. &ldquo;I fucked up and I want to make it up to you. Whatever it takes.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to make it up to me,&rdquo; she shook her head, unlocking her door.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I can try,&rdquo; he grinned, putting the flowers down. &ldquo;Now c&rsquo;mere, it&rsquo;s been a lonely six days.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p><b>a/n: would like to take this time to say that i&rsquo;m v v v saddened by the fact that none of my readers likened the title of my last harry one shot (holiday in the sun) to mary kate and ashley&rsquo;s second most iconic film</b></p><p><b>ok hope you enjoyed</b></p>",
