It is implied that they spend time to listen to stories together, and there\u2019s even a scene where we get Bran recalling an advice that Sansa gave him. I would honestly love to see them think about each other more since Bran seems to be the sibling that Sansa is the most attached to. All of Sansa\u2019s thoughts about Bran have been completely positive. Sansa dreamed of him smiling, she stated that she has used up all of her tears crying due to his fall (and Lady\u2019s execution), she thinks of Bran when she sees Tommen, he\u2019s one of the many people that she thinks of when she sings before the battle of the black water, she wants to name one of her sons after him, she describes him as being sweet and stated that everyone loved him, and she thinks of a time where she played in the snow with him and Arya. Clearly she loved him, and it\u2019s clear that they\u2019ve spent some time together. That being said, when Bran thinks of people to hang out with after his father and Robert left Winterfell to go hunt, he states not wanting to hang out with Rickon because he was a baby, and not wanting to hang out with Sansa and Arya because they were\u00a0\u2018\u2019only girls\u2019\u2019. Also, he calls the stories that Sansa likes to hear\u00a0\u2018\u2019stupid\u2019\u2019. I never said that they had a bad relationship, but that GRRM didn\u2019t give Sansa a sibling that she has a tight-knit relationship with (at least not in the same wavelength as Jon\u2019s relationship with Robb/Arya/Bran) nor did he give her a sibling that she could enjoy the more feminine-coded things she liked with. That being said, I do love this relationship and I am excited to see them interact with each other after they reunite.\u00a0\u00a0</p>",

It is implied that they spend time to listen to stories together, and there\u2019s even a scene where we get Bran recalling an advice that Sansa gave him. I would honestly love to see them think about each other more since Bran seems to be the sibling that Sansa is the most attached to. All of Sansa\u2019s thoughts about Bran have been completely positive. Sansa dreamed of him smiling, she stated that she has used up all of her tears crying due to his fall (and Lady\u2019s execution), she thinks of Bran when she sees Tommen, he\u2019s one of the many people that she thinks of when she sings before the battle of the black water, she wants to name one of her sons after him, she describes him as being sweet and stated that everyone loved him, and she thinks of a time where she played in the snow with him and Arya. Clearly she loved him, and it\u2019s clear that they\u2019ve spent some time together. That being said, when Bran thinks of people to hang out with after his father and Robert left Winterfell to go hunt, he states not wanting to hang out with Rickon because he was a baby, and not wanting to hang out with Sansa and Arya because they were\u00a0\u2018\u2019only girls\u2019\u2019. Also, he calls the stories that Sansa likes to hear\u00a0\u2018\u2019stupid\u2019\u2019. I never said that they had a bad relationship, but that GRRM didn\u2019t give Sansa a sibling that she has a tight-knit relationship with (at least not in the same wavelength as Jon\u2019s relationship with Robb/Arya/Bran) nor did he give her a sibling that she could enjoy the more feminine-coded things she liked with. That being said, I do love this relationship and I am excited to see them interact with each other after they reunite.\u00a0\u00a0</p>",

Count Petyr is a dreadful actor with a troupe of dreadful cohorts, and a sinister plan to claim the Stark fortune. </p><p>After his scheme is foiled, the Starks are passed on to a string of other locations- including Uncle Syrio, a Braavosi herpetologist they&rsquo;ve never met, who offers a brief period of happiness for the children, Aunt Lysa, an unstable, grammar-obsessed widow, who has lived alone in a crumbling old house known as the Eyrie ever since the death of her husband and son, and, strangely, a lumber mill. </p><p>At every turn, though, Count Petyr and his cohorts turn up in disguise, Mr. Tyrell fails to be of any use, and the same questions are raised again and again. Why did the Stark mansion burn down? What is the connection between the guardians the children are placed under? Who is Count Petyr, and why is he so awful? And who is the narrator of this tragic tale, Tyrion Lannister? How does he fit into all of this? </p>",
