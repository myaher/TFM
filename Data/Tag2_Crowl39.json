Sobbing and shaking you look up at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Crowley asks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026I know who kidnapped me. The Styne\u2019s, Jacob\nand Eldon. I recognized the laughter\u2026the shoes. Daddy, they are at Dean\u2019s\nhouse. He talked to them to get rid of me. They are behind all of this.\nJessica\u2019s death, Sam\u2019s kidnapping. My misery\u2026those two\u2026It was John and the\nStyne\u2019s, daddy. We need to\u2026\u201d</p><p>Watching your fathers face darken you know you\nmade a mistake coming here. <br/></p><p>He\u2019s angry yet mad\u2026but why? As you ran to him looking\nfor a safe haven?</p><p>\u201cYou are wrong my child. Not the Styne\u2019s and\nJohn. Me and the Styne\u2019s. It was my masterplan to get my business back. To\nregain control over John.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kidnapped Sam and his fianc\u00e9e. Threatened John\nto kill the girl and his beloved son. Johnny was stubborn so Jessica paid the\nprice. Eldon and Jacob didn\u2019t even want money. The fun was enough.\u201d </p><p>Eyes widen in horror you let your fathers\u2019 words\nsink in. He was behind all this?</p><p>\u201cThose men raped and killed Jessica, daddy. How\ncould you do this to Sam?\u201d You sob.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the business, my dear. Nothing personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you let them kidnap me too then? This\ndoesn\u2019t make sense at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see the kidnapping was nothing I did with\npleasure, but your mother wanted to tell John about my plans, and I had to make\nsure she shuts her mouth.\u201d</p><p>Hearing your fathers\u2019 words, you feel dizzy,\nnausea wells up your stomach and you have problems to keep yourself upright.</p><p>\u201cThe marks? Why the marks?\u201d You ask voice\ntrembling now.</p><p>\u201cTo make your mother see what happens when she\ntries to disturb my business.\u201d Crowley answers.</p><p>\u201cAll this for what? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo get my business back and to force John\nagreeing to the contract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe marriage was your idea? Is that the reason\nJohn treats my like\u2026 oh\u2026god\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. Don\u2019t worry. Johnny and Dean will be\nhistory soon, just like weak little Moose. Then you will marry Eldon and I can take over the family\nbusiness. You are the only surviving Winchester after all.\u201d Crowley snickers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026should go,\u201d you stammer.</p><p>\u201cInto your room. That\u2019s right.\u201d Crowley warns and\nyou nod.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Dad. I understand. I\u2019m sorry for causing\ntrouble. I\u2019ll be in my room then.\u201d You say running upstairs.</p><p>With shaking hands, you dial Dean\u2019s number to\ntell him\u2026well everything.</p><p>\u201cY/N? Where are you? What happened?\u201d Dean asks\nworriedly.</p><p>\u201cJust listen. I\u2019m so sorry. The Styne\u2019s I\nrecognized the laughter. They are the kidnappers. It\u2019s not John\u2026it\u2019s my father.\nHe\u2026oh god\u2026 I\u2019m so sorry. He was it all the time. My father said he wants to\nkill John and you to get hold of the business. He wants me to marry Eldon. Tell\nSammy I\u2019m so sorry. Crowley did all of this to force your dad to agree to the\nmarriage. I was wrong\u2026so wrong. Please forgive me\u2026I\u2019m\u2026I never hated you, Dean\u2026I\nliked you\u2026I want you to be happy.\u201d Hearing your father walking toward your room\nyou start crying.</p><p>\u201cI hope you can forgive me one day\u2026\u201d You sob.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d Dean asks.</p><p>\u201cHome\u2026my room.\u201d You whisper before hiding the\nphone under your bed sheets.</p><p>\u201cYou should rest now, daughter. Tomorrow you will\nmeet Eldon to show you can be a good wife to him.\u201d Your father orders and you\nstart crying.</p><p>Still listening to the phone Dean runs out of the\nhouse to get to the Impala as fast as possible.</p><p>\u2014-</p><p>Shaking in fear you sit on the bed. Why did you\nrun away? You could\u2019ve been safe with Dean but now your own father will allow\nEldon to hurt you again. <br/></p><p>There\u2019s no way out\u2026</p><p>Dean was right. Your father is the king of lies\nand you will have to follow his orders.</p><p>\u2014-</p><p>\u201cHello, Dean. What brings you to my house?\u201d\nCrowley snickers when Dean enters the manor gun in his hand</p><p>\u201cYou know why I came. I want my wife. Where is\nshe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn her room. You should better leave now. Coming\nto my house, alone. With a gun in your hands gives me the right to just kill\nyou, Dean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says I\u2019m alone? Benny, Cas, and Gadreel are\noutside. Just like ten of dad\u2019s men. I gave them the order to wait five\nminutes. If I\u2019m not out of the house with my wife in five then they will come\nfor me and her to make sure I\u2019ll get out safe.\u201d Dean lies.</p><p>\u201cTen\u2026oh\u2026\u201d Knowing all his men are busy preparing\nthe strike against John\u2019s men Crowley turns pale. \u201cY/N is upstairs. Go and get\nher, Winchester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, boy. Always so submissive.\u201d Dean grunts\nrunning upstairs to get you.</p><p>\u2014-</p><p>When the door to your room swings open you expect\nyour father or Eldon. What you don\u2019t expect is Dean worriedly looking at you.</p><p>\u201cWe got to go. Now. I lied. I\u2019m alone and Crowley\nwill find out soon. Come.\u201d Dean whispers taking you by the hand.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you come here? My father\u2026he\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are my wife, I won\u2019t let that scum touch\nwhat\u2019s mine. Now let\u2019s get out of this shithole. I\u2019ll bring you home.\u201d Dean\nwhispers leading you out of the room.</p><p>\u201cHome\u2026\u201d You whisper. Hours ago, you believed this\nhouse is your home.</p><p>Walking past your father with Dean by your side\nyour start shaking. Wrapping an arm around your shoulders Dean brings you out\nof the house. Guiding you toward the Impala he keeps an eye on Crowley.</p><p>\u2014-</p><p>\u201cYou ran away in your pajamas and without shoes?\u201d\nDean asks checking on you.</p><p>\u201cI was scared. You talked to them and then I\nheard the laughter. It was the same\u2026they did this to Jess. My father was behind\nall of this.\u201d You sob.</p><p>\u201cHey. That\u2019s not your fault.\u201d Dean says softly\nstroking some strands out of your face.</p><p>\u201cHe let those men kidnap me to punish my mother.\nShe wanted to tell your father about my father\u2019s plans. The marks. He\nordered that they shall mark me to remind my mother what will happen next\ntime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Sam and Jess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father wanted to force your dad to agree to\nthe marriage. John was stubborn so dad\u2026he \u2026 Jess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d Dean yells smashing a lamp\nagainst the wall.</p><p>\u201cHe wants to take over your dads\u2019 business. Kill\nall of you. As the only remaining Winchester\u2026I\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. I got to call dad and Sam. They will come\naround. Don\u2019t worry. You are safe with me. No one will ever hurt you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I never thought my father would do\nsuch a thing. Maybe he even killed my mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d Dean asks stroking your cheek.</p><p>\u201cI know they were arguing two days before she got\nkilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait here. Take a shower. Don\u2019t worry. Cas and\nBenny are securing the house. Gadreel and Garth are on their way. I called them\nwhile I was driving to your father\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came alone to save me. I\u2019m sorry for running\naway. What they said\u2026I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me. I knew\u2026when he said he knows how you\ntaste\u2026I knew it was him. I wanted to kill him but my gun\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026you left it in the nightstand because of me.\u201d\nSniffing you let Dean help you get up. Clinging to him you rest your head\nagainst his shoulder to let the tears fall. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it was my dad.\nTonight, I lost everything I had left of my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. You got a new family. Me and\nSam\u2026maybe even John. We won\u2019t let you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this marriage was forced.\u201d You whisper.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. I like you no matter what. I\nrisked my life to save you. I\u2026think.\u201d The ringing of the doorbell disturbs the intimate\nmoment.</p><p>\u201cDean\u2026thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a shower. I\u2019ll handle everything else. I\nguess Cas already informed dad and Sam. Just breathe Baby\u2026breathe.\u201d Dean\nwhispers and you nod.</p><p>\u2014-</p><p>\u201cDid you know?\u201d Dean asks looking at John.</p><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s the reason I refused to let you\nattack Lucifer. He had nothing to do with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you never tell me? I mean he forced you\nto agree to the marriage and give him half of your business after the wedding?\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cHe threatened Sam\u2019s life and even worse. I know\nwhat happened to Jess but Sam not. He had to watch when she died but he doesn\u2019t\nknow the whole truth. Crowley taped everything. Every minute of her misery. He\nthreatened me to show it to Sammy. I couldn\u2019t let him see it\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d Dean asks.</p><p>\u201cHe believes that they only did it once. They\ntook turns, Dean. The worst is Jess was pregnant. Please never tell Sam so. It\nwould kill him even more. I had no other choice than agreeing to the contract.\nIt was my fault. I never\u2026I knew Crowley is cruel some but that he would do such\na thing to Jess. I swear I would\u2019ve agreed right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t want to appear weak. Right, John?\u201d\nYou ask walking into the living room.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Y/N. I\u2019m sorry for my behavior but\nI thought if I and Dean treat you bad your dad would cut this whole marriage\noff. I was wrong, just like with Jess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father is a monster. I guess he killed mom\ntoo. She wanted to tell you everything he planned. That\u2019s the reason he\nkidnapped me\u2026well, let the Styne\u2019s kidnap me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom was\u2026wonderful,\u201d John whispers.</p><p>\u201cWonderful?\u201d You ask.</p><p>\u201cShe was the first woman after Mary\u2019s death I\ntruly loved. Crowley found out and killed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had and affair with my mom?\u201d You gasp.</p><p>\u201cWhen Sam turned eighteen you and your mom came\nto visit us. We talked for hours and that\u2019s how it began. We started as friends\nand in the end, we fell in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved her, Dean. I know it was wrong. She was\nmarried but I couldn\u2019t stop myself. I never felt happier since your mom\u2019s\ndeath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never told anybody?\u201d You ask.</p><p>\u201cAfter Crowley found out your mom tried to keep\nher distance. He hit her and when you turned eighteen she wanted to run away\nwith you\u2026and me. I prepared everything. She wasn\u2019t buying stuff for your\nbirthday party that day. She was trying to get some things from her safe deposit\nbox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how could he know\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cRowena. Your mom, she told her everything. Even\nthat he was behind all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRowena knew? She knew\u2026I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d You\nsob. \u201cI guess when my mom died I lost my whole family. This can\u2019t be true. How\ncould she do this to mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s your father\u2019s mother,\u201d Dean says slinging\nan arm around your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do know?\u201d You whisper.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, you two will get more guards. I\nsuggest that you won\u2019t leave the house without Dean or Benny by your side. I\u2019ll\ntell Cas and Benny to stay here. Five other men will take their positions in\nthe house across the street.\u201d John says.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Sammy?\u201d Dean asks.</p><p>\u201cI told him about the situation. That Crowley was\nbehind the kidnapping\u2026I can\u2019t tell him about Jess. This would kill him. He will\nstay with Bobby and Jody at the Mansion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you John? My father is after you\ntoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorried about me? That\u2019s cute. I\u2019m too stubborn\nto die. I\u2019ll coordinate the security and call our allies from outside.\u201d John\nexplains and Dean nods.</p><p>\u201cLucifer and Michael?\u201d Dean asks.</p><p>\u201cExactly. I know you don\u2019t like both, but they\nwere always reliable. You will stay here and protect her. She\u2019s your\nresponsibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo Sir!\u201d Dean protests and your heart sinks.</p><p>\u201cShe ain\u2019t my responsibility\u2026she\u2019s my wife and\nI\u2019ll protect her.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><b>How to kill your wife\nTags</b></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpFcc7sxIyXemp1fCqyeMuA\">@bitchwhytho</a>\u200b, <a class=\"tumblelog\"

To\nregain control over John.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kidnapped Sam and his fianc\u00e9e. Threatened John\nto kill the girl and his beloved son. Johnny was stubborn so Jessica paid the\nprice. Eldon and Jacob didn\u2019t even want money. The fun was enough.\u201d </p><p>Eyes widen in horror you let your fathers\u2019 words\nsink in. He was behind all this?</p><p>\u201cThose men raped and killed Jessica, daddy. How\ncould you do this to Sam?\u201d You sob.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the business, my dear. Nothing personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you let them kidnap me too then? This\ndoesn\u2019t make sense at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see the kidnapping was nothing I did with\npleasure, but your mother wanted to tell John about my plans, and I had to make\nsure she shuts her mouth.\u201d</p><p>Hearing your fathers\u2019 words, you feel dizzy,\nnausea wells up your stomach and you have problems to keep yourself upright.</p><p>\u201cThe marks? Why the marks?\u201d You ask voice\ntrembling now.</p><p>\u201cTo make your mother see what happens when she\ntries to disturb my business.\u201d Crowley answers.</p><p>\u201cAll this for what? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo get my business back and to force John\nagreeing to the contract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe marriage was your idea? Is that the reason\nJohn treats my like\u2026 oh\u2026god\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. Don\u2019t worry. Johnny and Dean will be\nhistory soon, just like weak little Moose. Then you will marry Eldon and I can take over the family\nbusiness. You are the only surviving Winchester after all.\u201d Crowley snickers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026should go,\u201d you stammer.</p><p>\u201cInto your room. That\u2019s right.\u201d Crowley warns and\nyou nod.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Dad. I understand. I\u2019m sorry for causing\ntrouble. I\u2019ll be in my room then.\u201d You say running upstairs.</p><p>With shaking hands, you dial Dean\u2019s number to\ntell him\u2026well everything.</p><p>\u201cY/N? Where are you? What happened?\u201d Dean asks\nworriedly.</p><p>\u201cJust listen. I\u2019m so sorry. The Styne\u2019s I\nrecognized the laughter. They are the kidnappers. It\u2019s not John\u2026it\u2019s my father.\nHe\u2026oh god\u2026 I\u2019m so sorry. He was it all the time. My father said he wants to\nkill John and you to get hold of the business. He wants me to marry Eldon. Tell\nSammy I\u2019m so sorry. Crowley did all of this to force your dad to agree to the\nmarriage. I was wrong\u2026so wrong. Please forgive me\u2026I\u2019m\u2026I never hated you, Dean\u2026I\nliked you\u2026I want you to be happy.\u201d Hearing your father walking toward your room\nyou start crying.</p><p>\u201cI hope you can forgive me one day\u2026\u201d You sob.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d Dean asks.</p><p>\u201cHome\u2026my room.\u201d You whisper before hiding the\nphone under your bed sheets.</p><p>\u201cYou should rest now, daughter. Tomorrow you will\nmeet Eldon to show you can be a good wife to him.\u201d Your father orders and you\nstart crying.</p><p>Still listening to the phone Dean runs out of the\nhouse to get to the Impala as fast as possible.</p><p>\u2014-</p><p>Shaking in fear you sit on the bed. Why did you\nrun away? You could\u2019ve been safe with Dean but now your own father will allow\nEldon to hurt you again. <br></p><p>There\u2019s no way out\u2026</p><p>Dean was right. Your father is the king of lies\nand you will have to follow his orders.</p><p>\u2014-</p><p>\u201cHello, Dean. What brings you to my house?\u201d\nCrowley snickers when Dean enters the manor gun in his hand</p><p>\u201cYou know why I came. I want my wife. Where is\nshe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn her room. You should better leave now. Coming\nto my house, alone. With a gun in your hands gives me the right to just kill\nyou, Dean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says I\u2019m alone? Benny, Cas, and Gadreel are\noutside. Just like ten of dad\u2019s men. I gave them the order to wait five\nminutes. If I\u2019m not out of the house with my wife in five then they will come\nfor me and her to make sure I\u2019ll get out safe.\u201d Dean lies.</p><p>\u201cTen\u2026oh\u2026\u201d Knowing all his men are busy preparing\nthe strike against John\u2019s men Crowley turns pale. \u201cY/N is upstairs. Go and get\nher, Winchester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, boy. Always so submissive.\u201d Dean grunts\nrunning upstairs to get you.</p><p>\u2014-</p><p>When the door to your room swings open you expect\nyour father or Eldon. What you don\u2019t expect is Dean worriedly looking at you.</p><p>\u201cWe got to go. Now. I lied. I\u2019m alone and Crowley\nwill find out soon. Come.\u201d Dean whispers taking you by the hand.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you come here? My father\u2026he\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are my wife, I won\u2019t let that scum touch\nwhat\u2019s mine. Now let\u2019s get out of this shithole. I\u2019ll bring you home.\u201d Dean\nwhispers leading you out of the room.</p><p>\u201cHome\u2026\u201d You whisper. Hours ago, you believed this\nhouse is your home.</p><p>Walking past your father with Dean by your side\nyour start shaking. Wrapping an arm around your shoulders Dean brings you out\nof the house. Guiding you toward the Impala he keeps an eye on Crowley.</p><p>\u2014-</p><p>\u201cYou ran away in your pajamas and without shoes?\u201d\nDean asks checking on you.</p><p>\u201cI was scared. You talked to them and then I\nheard the laughter. It was the same\u2026they did this to Jess. My father was behind\nall of this.\u201d You sob.</p><p>\u201cHey. That\u2019s not your fault.\u201d Dean says softly\nstroking some strands out of your face.</p><p>\u201cHe let those men kidnap me to punish my mother.\nShe wanted to tell your father about my father\u2019s plans. The marks. He\nordered that they shall mark me to remind my mother what will happen next\ntime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Sam and Jess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father wanted to force your dad to agree to\nthe marriage. John was stubborn so dad\u2026he \u2026 Jess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d Dean yells smashing a lamp\nagainst the wall.</p><p>\u201cHe wants to take over your dads\u2019 business. Kill\nall of you. As the only remaining Winchester\u2026I\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. I got to call dad and Sam. They will come\naround. Don\u2019t worry. You are safe with me. No one will ever hurt you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I never thought my father would do\nsuch a thing. Maybe he even killed my mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d Dean asks stroking your cheek.</p><p>\u201cI know they were arguing two days before she got\nkilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait here. Take a shower. Don\u2019t worry. Cas and\nBenny are securing the house. Gadreel and Garth are on their way. I called them\nwhile I was driving to your father\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came alone to save me. I\u2019m sorry for running\naway. What they said\u2026I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me. I knew\u2026when he said he knows how you\ntaste\u2026I knew it was him. I wanted to kill him but my gun\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026you left it in the nightstand because of me.\u201d\nSniffing you let Dean help you get up. Clinging to him you rest your head\nagainst his shoulder to let the tears fall. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it was my dad.\nTonight, I lost everything I had left of my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. You got a new family. Me and\nSam\u2026maybe even John. We won\u2019t let you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this marriage was forced.\u201d You whisper.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. I like you no matter what. I\nrisked my life to save you. I\u2026think.\u201d The ringing of the doorbell disturbs the intimate\nmoment.</p><p>\u201cDean\u2026thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a shower. I\u2019ll handle everything else. I\nguess Cas already informed dad and Sam. Just breathe Baby\u2026breathe.\u201d Dean\nwhispers and you nod.</p><p>\u2014-</p><p>\u201cDid you know?\u201d Dean asks looking at John.</p><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s the reason I refused to let you\nattack Lucifer. He had nothing to do with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you never tell me? I mean he forced you\nto agree to the marriage and give him half of your business after the wedding?\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cHe threatened Sam\u2019s life and even worse. I know\nwhat happened to Jess but Sam not. He had to watch when she died but he doesn\u2019t\nknow the whole truth. Crowley taped everything. Every minute of her misery. He\nthreatened me to show it to Sammy. I couldn\u2019t let him see it\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d Dean asks.</p><p>\u201cHe believes that they only did it once. They\ntook turns, Dean. The worst is Jess was pregnant. Please never tell Sam so. It\nwould kill him even more. I had no other choice than agreeing to the contract.\nIt was my fault. I never\u2026I knew Crowley is cruel some but that he would do such\na thing to Jess. I swear I would\u2019ve agreed right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t want to appear weak. Right, John?\u201d\nYou ask walking into the living room.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Y/N. I\u2019m sorry for my behavior but\nI thought if I and Dean treat you bad your dad would cut this whole marriage\noff. I was wrong, just like with Jess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father is a monster. I guess he killed mom\ntoo. She wanted to tell you everything he planned. That\u2019s the reason he\nkidnapped me\u2026well, let the Styne\u2019s kidnap me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom was\u2026wonderful,\u201d John whispers.</p><p>\u201cWonderful?\u201d You ask.</p><p>\u201cShe was the first woman after Mary\u2019s death I\ntruly loved. Crowley found out and killed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had and affair with my mom?\u201d You gasp.</p><p>\u201cWhen Sam turned eighteen you and your mom came\nto visit us. We talked for hours and that\u2019s how it began. We started as friends\nand in the end, we fell in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved her, Dean. I know it was wrong. She was\nmarried but I couldn\u2019t stop myself. I never felt happier since your mom\u2019s\ndeath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never told anybody?\u201d You ask.</p><p>\u201cAfter Crowley found out your mom tried to keep\nher distance. He hit her and when you turned eighteen she wanted to run away\nwith you\u2026and me. I prepared everything. She wasn\u2019t buying stuff for your\nbirthday party that day. She was trying to get some things from her safe deposit\nbox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how could he know\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cRowena. Your mom, she told her everything. Even\nthat he was behind all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRowena knew? She knew\u2026I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d You\nsob. \u201cI guess when my mom died I lost my whole family. This can\u2019t be true. How\ncould she do this to mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s your father\u2019s mother,\u201d Dean says slinging\nan arm around your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do know?\u201d You whisper.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, you two will get more guards. I\nsuggest that you won\u2019t leave the house without Dean or Benny by your side. I\u2019ll\ntell Cas and Benny to stay here. Five other men will take their positions in\nthe house across the street.\u201d John says.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Sammy?\u201d Dean asks.</p><p>\u201cI told him about the situation. That Crowley was\nbehind the kidnapping\u2026I can\u2019t tell him about Jess. This would kill him. He will\nstay with Bobby and Jody at the Mansion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you John? My father is after you\ntoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorried about me? That\u2019s cute. I\u2019m too stubborn\nto die. I\u2019ll coordinate the security and call our allies from outside.\u201d John\nexplains and Dean nods.</p><p>\u201cLucifer and Michael?\u201d Dean asks.</p><p>\u201cExactly. I know you don\u2019t like both, but they\nwere always reliable. You will stay here and protect her. She\u2019s your\nresponsibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo Sir!\u201d Dean protests and your heart sinks.</p><p>\u201cShe ain\u2019t my responsibility\u2026she\u2019s my wife and\nI\u2019ll protect her.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><b>How to kill your wife\nTags</b></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpFcc7sxIyXemp1fCqyeMuA\">@bitchwhytho</a>\u200b, <a class=\"tumblelog\"

To\nregain control over John.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kidnapped Sam and his fianc\u00e9e. Threatened John\nto kill the girl and his beloved son. Johnny was stubborn so Jessica paid the\nprice. Eldon and Jacob didn\u2019t even want money. The fun was enough.\u201d </p><p>Eyes widen in horror you let your fathers\u2019 words\nsink in. He was behind all this?</p><p>\u201cThose men raped and killed Jessica, daddy. How\ncould you do this to Sam?\u201d You sob.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the business, my dear. Nothing personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you let them kidnap me too then? This\ndoesn\u2019t make sense at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see the kidnapping was nothing I did with\npleasure, but your mother wanted to tell John about my plans, and I had to make\nsure she shuts her mouth.\u201d</p><p>Hearing your fathers\u2019 words, you feel dizzy,\nnausea wells up your stomach and you have problems to keep yourself upright.</p><p>\u201cThe marks? Why the marks?\u201d You ask voice\ntrembling now.</p><p>\u201cTo make your mother see what happens when she\ntries to disturb my business.\u201d Crowley answers.</p><p>\u201cAll this for what? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo get my business back and to force John\nagreeing to the contract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe marriage was your idea? Is that the reason\nJohn treats my like\u2026 oh\u2026god\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. Don\u2019t worry. Johnny and Dean will be\nhistory soon, just like weak little Moose. Then you will marry Eldon and I can take over the family\nbusiness. You are the only surviving Winchester after all.\u201d Crowley snickers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026should go,\u201d you stammer.</p><p>\u201cInto your room. That\u2019s right.\u201d Crowley warns and\nyou nod.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Dad. I understand. I\u2019m sorry for causing\ntrouble. I\u2019ll be in my room then.\u201d You say running upstairs.</p><p>With shaking hands, you dial Dean\u2019s number to\ntell him\u2026well everything.</p><p>\u201cY/N? Where are you? What happened?\u201d Dean asks\nworriedly.</p><p>\u201cJust listen. I\u2019m so sorry. The Styne\u2019s I\nrecognized the laughter. They are the kidnappers. It\u2019s not John\u2026it\u2019s my father.\nHe\u2026oh god\u2026 I\u2019m so sorry. He was it all the time. My father said he wants to\nkill John and you to get hold of the business. He wants me to marry Eldon. Tell\nSammy I\u2019m so sorry. Crowley did all of this to force your dad to agree to the\nmarriage. I was wrong\u2026so wrong. Please forgive me\u2026I\u2019m\u2026I never hated you, Dean\u2026I\nliked you\u2026I want you to be happy.\u201d Hearing your father walking toward your room\nyou start crying.</p><p>\u201cI hope you can forgive me one day\u2026\u201d You sob.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d Dean asks.</p><p>\u201cHome\u2026my room.\u201d You whisper before hiding the\nphone under your bed sheets.</p><p>\u201cYou should rest now, daughter. Tomorrow you will\nmeet Eldon to show you can be a good wife to him.\u201d Your father orders and you\nstart crying.</p><p>Still listening to the phone Dean runs out of the\nhouse to get to the Impala as fast as possible.</p><p>\u2014-</p><p>Shaking in fear you sit on the bed. Why did you\nrun away? You could\u2019ve been safe with Dean but now your own father will allow\nEldon to hurt you again. <br></p><p>There\u2019s no way out\u2026</p><p>Dean was right. Your father is the king of lies\nand you will have to follow his orders.</p><p>\u2014-</p><p>\u201cHello, Dean. What brings you to my house?\u201d\nCrowley snickers when Dean enters the manor gun in his hand</p><p>\u201cYou know why I came. I want my wife. Where is\nshe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn her room. You should better leave now. Coming\nto my house, alone. With a gun in your hands gives me the right to just kill\nyou, Dean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says I\u2019m alone? Benny, Cas, and Gadreel are\noutside. Just like ten of dad\u2019s men. I gave them the order to wait five\nminutes. If I\u2019m not out of the house with my wife in five then they will come\nfor me and her to make sure I\u2019ll get out safe.\u201d Dean lies.</p><p>\u201cTen\u2026oh\u2026\u201d Knowing all his men are busy preparing\nthe strike against John\u2019s men Crowley turns pale. \u201cY/N is upstairs. Go and get\nher, Winchester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, boy. Always so submissive.\u201d Dean grunts\nrunning upstairs to get you.</p><p>\u2014-</p><p>When the door to your room swings open you expect\nyour father or Eldon. What you don\u2019t expect is Dean worriedly looking at you.</p><p>\u201cWe got to go. Now. I lied. I\u2019m alone and Crowley\nwill find out soon. Come.\u201d Dean whispers taking you by the hand.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you come here? My father\u2026he\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are my wife, I won\u2019t let that scum touch\nwhat\u2019s mine. Now let\u2019s get out of this shithole. I\u2019ll bring you home.\u201d Dean\nwhispers leading you out of the room.</p><p>\u201cHome\u2026\u201d You whisper. Hours ago, you believed this\nhouse is your home.</p><p>Walking past your father with Dean by your side\nyour start shaking. Wrapping an arm around your shoulders Dean brings you out\nof the house. Guiding you toward the Impala he keeps an eye on Crowley.</p><p>\u2014-</p><p>\u201cYou ran away in your pajamas and without shoes?\u201d\nDean asks checking on you.</p><p>\u201cI was scared. You talked to them and then I\nheard the laughter. It was the same\u2026they did this to Jess. My father was behind\nall of this.\u201d You sob.</p><p>\u201cHey. That\u2019s not your fault.\u201d Dean says softly\nstroking some strands out of your face.</p><p>\u201cHe let those men kidnap me to punish my mother.\nShe wanted to tell your father about my father\u2019s plans. The marks. He\nordered that they shall mark me to remind my mother what will happen next\ntime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Sam and Jess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father wanted to force your dad to agree to\nthe marriage. John was stubborn so dad\u2026he \u2026 Jess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d Dean yells smashing a lamp\nagainst the wall.</p><p>\u201cHe wants to take over your dads\u2019 business. Kill\nall of you. As the only remaining Winchester\u2026I\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. I got to call dad and Sam. They will come\naround. Don\u2019t worry. You are safe with me. No one will ever hurt you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I never thought my father would do\nsuch a thing. Maybe he even killed my mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d Dean asks stroking your cheek.</p><p>\u201cI know they were arguing two days before she got\nkilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait here. Take a shower. Don\u2019t worry. Cas and\nBenny are securing the house. Gadreel and Garth are on their way. I called them\nwhile I was driving to your father\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came alone to save me. I\u2019m sorry for running\naway. What they said\u2026I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me. I knew\u2026when he said he knows how you\ntaste\u2026I knew it was him. I wanted to kill him but my gun\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026you left it in the nightstand because of me.\u201d\nSniffing you let Dean help you get up. Clinging to him you rest your head\nagainst his shoulder to let the tears fall. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it was my dad.\nTonight, I lost everything I had left of my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. You got a new family. Me and\nSam\u2026maybe even John. We won\u2019t let you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this marriage was forced.\u201d You whisper.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. I like you no matter what. I\nrisked my life to save you. I\u2026think.\u201d The ringing of the doorbell disturbs the intimate\nmoment.</p><p>\u201cDean\u2026thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a shower. I\u2019ll handle everything else. I\nguess Cas already informed dad and Sam. Just breathe Baby\u2026breathe.\u201d Dean\nwhispers and you nod.</p><p>\u2014-</p><p>\u201cDid you know?\u201d Dean asks looking at John.</p><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s the reason I refused to let you\nattack Lucifer. He had nothing to do with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you never tell me? I mean he forced you\nto agree to the marriage and give him half of your business after the wedding?\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cHe threatened Sam\u2019s life and even worse. I know\nwhat happened to Jess but Sam not. He had to watch when she died but he doesn\u2019t\nknow the whole truth. Crowley taped everything. Every minute of her misery. He\nthreatened me to show it to Sammy. I couldn\u2019t let him see it\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d Dean asks.</p><p>\u201cHe believes that they only did it once. They\ntook turns, Dean. The worst is Jess was pregnant. Please never tell Sam so. It\nwould kill him even more. I had no other choice than agreeing to the contract.\nIt was my fault. I never\u2026I knew Crowley is cruel some but that he would do such\na thing to Jess. I swear I would\u2019ve agreed right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t want to appear weak. Right, John?\u201d\nYou ask walking into the living room.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Y/N. I\u2019m sorry for my behavior but\nI thought if I and Dean treat you bad your dad would cut this whole marriage\noff. I was wrong, just like with Jess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father is a monster. I guess he killed mom\ntoo. She wanted to tell you everything he planned. That\u2019s the reason he\nkidnapped me\u2026well, let the Styne\u2019s kidnap me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom was\u2026wonderful,\u201d John whispers.</p><p>\u201cWonderful?\u201d You ask.</p><p>\u201cShe was the first woman after Mary\u2019s death I\ntruly loved. Crowley found out and killed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had and affair with my mom?\u201d You gasp.</p><p>\u201cWhen Sam turned eighteen you and your mom came\nto visit us. We talked for hours and that\u2019s how it began. We started as friends\nand in the end, we fell in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved her, Dean. I know it was wrong. She was\nmarried but I couldn\u2019t stop myself. I never felt happier since your mom\u2019s\ndeath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never told anybody?\u201d You ask.</p><p>\u201cAfter Crowley found out your mom tried to keep\nher distance. He hit her and when you turned eighteen she wanted to run away\nwith you\u2026and me. I prepared everything. She wasn\u2019t buying stuff for your\nbirthday party that day. She was trying to get some things from her safe deposit\nbox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how could he know\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cRowena. Your mom, she told her everything. Even\nthat he was behind all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRowena knew? She knew\u2026I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d You\nsob. \u201cI guess when my mom died I lost my whole family. This can\u2019t be true. How\ncould she do this to mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s your father\u2019s mother,\u201d Dean says slinging\nan arm around your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do know?\u201d You whisper.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, you two will get more guards. I\nsuggest that you won\u2019t leave the house without Dean or Benny by your side. I\u2019ll\ntell Cas and Benny to stay here. Five other men will take their positions in\nthe house across the street.\u201d John says.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Sammy?\u201d Dean asks.</p><p>\u201cI told him about the situation. That Crowley was\nbehind the kidnapping\u2026I can\u2019t tell him about Jess. This would kill him. He will\nstay with Bobby and Jody at the Mansion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you John? My father is after you\ntoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorried about me? That\u2019s cute. I\u2019m too stubborn\nto die. I\u2019ll coordinate the security and call our allies from outside.\u201d John\nexplains and Dean nods.</p><p>\u201cLucifer and Michael?\u201d Dean asks.</p><p>\u201cExactly. I know you don\u2019t like both, but they\nwere always reliable. You will stay here and protect her.

Sobbing and shaking you look up at him.</p><p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Crowley asks.</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;I know who kidnapped me. The Styne&rsquo;s, Jacob\nand Eldon. I recognized the laughter&hellip;the shoes. Daddy, they are at Dean&rsquo;s\nhouse. He talked to them to get rid of me. They are behind all of this.\nJessica&rsquo;s death, Sam&rsquo;s kidnapping. My misery&hellip;those two&hellip;It was John and the\nStyne&rsquo;s, daddy. We need to&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Watching your fathers face darken you know you\nmade a mistake coming here. <br /></p><p>He&rsquo;s angry yet mad&hellip;but why? As you ran to him looking\nfor a safe haven?</p><p>&ldquo;You are wrong my child. Not the Styne&rsquo;s and\nJohn. Me and the Styne&rsquo;s. It was my masterplan to get my business back. To\nregain control over John.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I kidnapped Sam and his fianc&eacute;e. Threatened John\nto kill the girl and his beloved son. Johnny was stubborn so Jessica paid the\nprice. Eldon and Jacob didn&rsquo;t even want money. The fun was enough.&rdquo; </p><p>Eyes widen in horror you let your fathers&rsquo; words\nsink in. He was behind all this?</p><p>&ldquo;Those men raped and killed Jessica, daddy. How\ncould you do this to Sam?&rdquo; You sob.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the business, my dear. Nothing personal.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you let them kidnap me too then? This\ndoesn&rsquo;t make sense at all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You see the kidnapping was nothing I did with\npleasure, but your mother wanted to tell John about my plans, and I had to make\nsure she shuts her mouth.&rdquo;</p><p>Hearing your fathers&rsquo; words, you feel dizzy,\nnausea wells up your stomach and you have problems to keep yourself upright.</p><p>&ldquo;The marks? Why the marks?&rdquo; You ask voice\ntrembling now.</p><p>&ldquo;To make your mother see what happens when she\ntries to disturb my business.&rdquo; Crowley answers.</p><p>&ldquo;All this for what? Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To get my business back and to force John\nagreeing to the contract.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The marriage was your idea? Is that the reason\nJohn treats my like&hellip; oh&hellip;god&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well. Don&rsquo;t worry. Johnny and Dean will be\nhistory soon, just like weak little Moose. Then you will marry Eldon and I can take over the family\nbusiness. You are the only surviving Winchester after all.&rdquo; Crowley snickers.</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;should go,&rdquo; you stammer.</p><p>&ldquo;Into your room. That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; Crowley warns and\nyou nod.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay. Dad. I understand. I&rsquo;m sorry for causing\ntrouble. I&rsquo;ll be in my room then.&rdquo; You say running upstairs.</p><p>With shaking hands, you dial Dean&rsquo;s number to\ntell him&hellip;well everything.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N? Where are you? What happened?&rdquo; Dean asks\nworriedly.</p><p>&ldquo;Just listen. I&rsquo;m so sorry. The Styne&rsquo;s I\nrecognized the laughter. They are the kidnappers. It&rsquo;s not John&hellip;it&rsquo;s my father.\nHe&hellip;oh god&hellip; I&rsquo;m so sorry. He was it all the time. My father said he wants to\nkill John and you to get hold of the business. He wants me to marry Eldon. Tell\nSammy I&rsquo;m so sorry. Crowley did all of this to force your dad to agree to the\nmarriage. I was wrong&hellip;so wrong. Please forgive me&hellip;I&rsquo;m&hellip;I never hated you, Dean&hellip;I\nliked you&hellip;I want you to be happy.&rdquo; Hearing your father walking toward your room\nyou start crying.</p><p>&ldquo;I hope you can forgive me one day&hellip;&rdquo; You sob.</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; Dean asks.</p><p>&ldquo;Home&hellip;my room.&rdquo; You whisper before hiding the\nphone under your bed sheets.</p><p>&ldquo;You should rest now, daughter. Tomorrow you will\nmeet Eldon to show you can be a good wife to him.&rdquo; Your father orders and you\nstart crying.</p><p>Still listening to the phone Dean runs out of the\nhouse to get to the Impala as fast as possible.</p><p>&mdash;-</p><p>Shaking in fear you sit on the bed. Why did you\nrun away? You could&rsquo;ve been safe with Dean but now your own father will allow\nEldon to hurt you again. <br /></p><p>There&rsquo;s no way out&hellip;</p><p>Dean was right. Your father is the king of lies\nand you will have to follow his orders.</p><p>&mdash;-</p><p>&ldquo;Hello, Dean. What brings you to my house?&rdquo;\nCrowley snickers when Dean enters the manor gun in his hand</p><p>&ldquo;You know why I came. I want my wife. Where is\nshe?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In her room. You should better leave now. Coming\nto my house, alone. With a gun in your hands gives me the right to just kill\nyou, Dean.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who says I&rsquo;m alone? Benny, Cas, and Gadreel are\noutside. Just like ten of dad&rsquo;s men. I gave them the order to wait five\nminutes. If I&rsquo;m not out of the house with my wife in five then they will come\nfor me and her to make sure I&rsquo;ll get out safe.&rdquo; Dean lies.</p><p>&ldquo;Ten&hellip;oh&hellip;&rdquo; Knowing all his men are busy preparing\nthe strike against John&rsquo;s men Crowley turns pale. &ldquo;Y/N is upstairs. Go and get\nher, Winchester.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good, boy. Always so submissive.&rdquo; Dean grunts\nrunning upstairs to get you.</p><p>&mdash;-</p><p>When the door to your room swings open you expect\nyour father or Eldon. What you don&rsquo;t expect is Dean worriedly looking at you.</p><p>&ldquo;We got to go. Now. I lied. I&rsquo;m alone and Crowley\nwill find out soon. Come.&rdquo; Dean whispers taking you by the hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you come here? My father&hellip;he&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are my wife, I won&rsquo;t let that scum touch\nwhat&rsquo;s mine. Now let&rsquo;s get out of this shithole. I&rsquo;ll bring you home.&rdquo; Dean\nwhispers leading you out of the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Home&hellip;&rdquo; You whisper. Hours ago, you believed this\nhouse is your home.</p><p>Walking past your father with Dean by your side\nyour start shaking. Wrapping an arm around your shoulders Dean brings you out\nof the house. Guiding you toward the Impala he keeps an eye on Crowley.</p><p>&mdash;-</p><p>&ldquo;You ran away in your pajamas and without shoes?&rdquo;\nDean asks checking on you.</p><p>&ldquo;I was scared. You talked to them and then I\nheard the laughter. It was the same&hellip;they did this to Jess. My father was behind\nall of this.&rdquo; You sob.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey. That&rsquo;s not your fault.&rdquo; Dean says softly\nstroking some strands out of your face.</p><p>&ldquo;He let those men kidnap me to punish my mother.\nShe wanted to tell your father about my father&rsquo;s plans. The marks. He\nordered that they shall mark me to remind my mother what will happen next\ntime.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What about Sam and Jess?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My father wanted to force your dad to agree to\nthe marriage. John was stubborn so dad&hellip;he &hellip; Jess.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Son of a bitch!&rdquo; Dean yells smashing a lamp\nagainst the wall.</p><p>&ldquo;He wants to take over your dads&rsquo; business. Kill\nall of you. As the only remaining Winchester&hellip;I&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shit. I got to call dad and Sam. They will come\naround. Don&rsquo;t worry. You are safe with me. No one will ever hurt you again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry. I never thought my father would do\nsuch a thing. Maybe he even killed my mom?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You think so?&rdquo; Dean asks stroking your cheek.</p><p>&ldquo;I know they were arguing two days before she got\nkilled.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait here. Take a shower. Don&rsquo;t worry. Cas and\nBenny are securing the house. Gadreel and Garth are on their way. I called them\nwhile I was driving to your father&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You came alone to save me. I&rsquo;m sorry for running\naway. What they said&hellip;I thought.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look at me. I knew&hellip;when he said he knows how you\ntaste&hellip;I knew it was him. I wanted to kill him but my gun&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip;you left it in the nightstand because of me.&rdquo;\nSniffing you let Dean help you get up. Clinging to him you rest your head\nagainst his shoulder to let the tears fall. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it was my dad.\nTonight, I lost everything I had left of my family.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t matter. You got a new family. Me and\nSam&hellip;maybe even John. We won&rsquo;t let you down.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But this marriage was forced.&rdquo; You whisper.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. I like you no matter what. I\nrisked my life to save you. I&hellip;think.&rdquo; The ringing of the doorbell disturbs the intimate\nmoment.</p><p>&ldquo;Dean&hellip;thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Take a shower. I&rsquo;ll handle everything else. I\nguess Cas already informed dad and Sam. Just breathe Baby&hellip;breathe.&rdquo; Dean\nwhispers and you nod.</p><p>&mdash;-</p><p>&ldquo;Did you know?&rdquo; Dean asks looking at John.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. That&rsquo;s the reason I refused to let you\nattack Lucifer. He had nothing to do with this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you never tell me? I mean he forced you\nto agree to the marriage and give him half of your business after the wedding?&rdquo;\n</p><p>&ldquo;He threatened Sam&rsquo;s life and even worse. I know\nwhat happened to Jess but Sam not. He had to watch when she died but he doesn&rsquo;t\nknow the whole truth. Crowley taped everything. Every minute of her misery. He\nthreatened me to show it to Sammy. I couldn&rsquo;t let him see it&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dad?&rdquo; Dean asks.</p><p>&ldquo;He believes that they only did it once. They\ntook turns, Dean. The worst is Jess was pregnant. Please never tell Sam so. It\nwould kill him even more. I had no other choice than agreeing to the contract.\nIt was my fault. I never&hellip;I knew Crowley is cruel some but that he would do such\na thing to Jess. I swear I would&rsquo;ve agreed right away.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t want to appear weak. Right, John?&rdquo;\nYou ask walking into the living room.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Y/N. I&rsquo;m sorry for my behavior but\nI thought if I and Dean treat you bad your dad would cut this whole marriage\noff. I was wrong, just like with Jess.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My father is a monster. I guess he killed mom\ntoo. She wanted to tell you everything he planned. That&rsquo;s the reason he\nkidnapped me&hellip;well, let the Styne&rsquo;s kidnap me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your mom was&hellip;wonderful,&rdquo; John whispers.</p><p>&ldquo;Wonderful?&rdquo; You ask.</p><p>&ldquo;She was the first woman after Mary&rsquo;s death I\ntruly loved. Crowley found out and killed her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You had and affair with my mom?&rdquo; You gasp.</p><p>&ldquo;When Sam turned eighteen you and your mom came\nto visit us. We talked for hours and that&rsquo;s how it began. We started as friends\nand in the end, we fell in love.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dad?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I loved her, Dean. I know it was wrong. She was\nmarried but I couldn&rsquo;t stop myself. I never felt happier since your mom&rsquo;s\ndeath.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You never told anybody?&rdquo; You ask.</p><p>&ldquo;After Crowley found out your mom tried to keep\nher distance. He hit her and when you turned eighteen she wanted to run away\nwith you&hellip;and me. I prepared everything. She wasn&rsquo;t buying stuff for your\nbirthday party that day. She was trying to get some things from her safe deposit\nbox.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But how could he know&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Rowena. Your mom, she told her everything. Even\nthat he was behind all this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Rowena knew? She knew&hellip;I can&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo; You\nsob. &ldquo;I guess when my mom died I lost my whole family. This can&rsquo;t be true. How\ncould she do this to mom?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s your father&rsquo;s mother,&rdquo; Dean says slinging\nan arm around your shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;What do we do know?&rdquo; You whisper.</p><p>&ldquo;First of all, you two will get more guards. I\nsuggest that you won&rsquo;t leave the house without Dean or Benny by your side. I&rsquo;ll\ntell Cas and Benny to stay here. Five other men will take their positions in\nthe house across the street.&rdquo; John says.</p><p>&ldquo;What about Sammy?&rdquo; Dean asks.</p><p>&ldquo;I told him about the situation. That Crowley was\nbehind the kidnapping&hellip;I can&rsquo;t tell him about Jess. This would kill him. He will\nstay with Bobby and Jody at the Mansion.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What about you John? My father is after you\ntoo.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Worried about me? That&rsquo;s cute. I&rsquo;m too stubborn\nto die.
