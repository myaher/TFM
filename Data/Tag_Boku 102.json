My writing is a weird hybrid these past couple years (which usually means I have to fix it to past tense), and I just fully committed to present tense today and didn&rsquo;t feel like editing it into past tense.<br /></p><p>Izuku isn&rsquo;t used to spirits seeking him\nout. Generally, when he helps a lost spirit they pass on without any\ntime to go a tell the other spirits of the boy who can see them.\nThere are also the spirits content to linger on the earthly plane\nwith no grudge, or to perform more of a guardian rule, and Izuku\ntries not to tip his hand that he can see them, and thus he maintains\nhis anonymity. There are a few household ghosts from when Izuku was\nfirst discovering his power, but they are either too lazy or\nprotective to spill his secret. \n</p><p>The samurai spirit sitting stoically in\nthe corner of his room seemingly at peace just waiting knowingly\nturns his eyes to Izuku when he hears the rustle of blankets. Izuku\nfreezes which in hindsight is more suspicious and tips his hands, but\nthe way the samurai maintains eye contacts gives Izuku the sinking\nsuspension he knows that Izuku can see him.</p><p>Izuku could try and play dumb and\npretend he can&rsquo;t see the spirits, but he&rsquo;s fairly certain the spirit\nknows and wouldn&rsquo;t have been waiting for him to wake if he didn&rsquo;t.\nIzuku decides to bite the bullet and find out what he wants.</p><p>&ldquo;Um do you need help passing on to\nthe next life?&rdquo; he asks tentatively.</p><p>The spirit chuckles before answering,\n&ldquo;No, my spirit had already been put to peace long before you were\nborn. My name is Amidamaru and I serve the Asakura family. While the\ncurrent generations have forgotten the ways of their heritage, there\nis still one far from eternal rests who I still serve. Upon his\nrequest I&rsquo;ve come to help you in his stead.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The boy with the orange headphones?&rdquo;\nIzuku asks.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Amidamaru confirms,\n&ldquo;although before you ask anymore about him, know that I am not\nallowed to give you those answers.&rdquo;</p><p>Izuku purses his lips before deciding\non the next question to ask. &ldquo;Then why are you here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;None are really practicing the ways\nof Shamanism, so if you want to learn to use your gift then you must\nlearn from the spirits or self teach. There is one far more qualified\nto teach you, but his absence would immediately be noticed, and alas\nthe spirits of past shaman would be out of questioned for the same\nreason. Plus if you want to pass off your gift as a quirk to get into\nhero school, you would need to discard much of the old way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right the spirit would either\nneed to control my body which would be difficult to pass off as a\npossession quirk because to completely optimize it I would need to\nhave different spirits qualified for different situations. The other\noption is to channel through a medium, but I would have to find a way\nto play off that I would always need a support item to use my quirk.\nNo to mention I would have to find just the right spirit and item\ncombination that would be believable,&rdquo; Izuku mutters, chin cupped\nin his hand as his bedroom melts away as he spiral deeper and deeper\ninto thought.</p><p>The spirit clears his throat to bring\nIzuku out of his thoughts once the muttering drops to an inaudible\nlevel. &ldquo;There is one other option, however, there are several\nconditions to it working. One you will be drawn into a major and\nconflict and will have to take up the responsibility of fighting\nagainst a threat to all humanity. Two there is only one person who\ncan give you this power, and you must earn it on your own merit.\nThere is no divine intervention that can make this individual pick\nyou. With it you could have your own quirk in addition to being able\nto use the tactile advantage of the spirits.&rdquo;</p><p>Without missing a beat Izuku answers,\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in. Tell me who I need to prove myself too.&rdquo;</p><p>Amidamaru takes a cursory glance of\nIzuku&rsquo;s room trying to hide the smile pulling at his lips. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t\nthink it should be hard to figure out,&rdquo; he answers fading into the\nbackground.</p><p>Izuku takes a look around his room. He\nisn&rsquo;t sure what Amidamaru saw, but something must had made the spirit\nsure Izuku could figure this out. Amidamaru had been cryptic, as if\nhe and the boy with the orange headphones shouldn&rsquo;t have been\ncontacting him. Was it a faux pas for spirits to help the living, or\nwere they trying to orchestrate something they weren&rsquo;t supposed to\ninterfere in? Izuku had read on the website about the Shaman Fight\nand how it crowned a Shaman King. Did all of this go against the\nking&rsquo;s wishes? Surely he was a benevolent and kind ruler, but the\nwebsite hadn&rsquo;t really had much details on what happened after someone\nbecomes Shaman King. Did they only get to fulfill one wish? Did they\nhave to take a backseat and just let events unfold as they played\nout? Was this more of a title and figure head with no real power? It\nall didn&rsquo;t make sense. Somehow after this whole encounter Izuku had\nbeen left with a million questions he didn&rsquo;t even know he had.</p><p>With a frustrated sigh, Izuku gets out\nof his bed and exits his room. He needs some breakfast, and maybe if\nhe tells his mom all the weird things that have happened in the last\n12 hours then maybe something will make sense. \n</p><p>As his door shuts behind him, he misses\nthe ghost peering in his window, eyes sharp and observing.</p>",
