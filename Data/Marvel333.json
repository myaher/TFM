Something deeply\nspiritual. The way we fall in one another so naturally like our love carved of\nthe earth. There are star systems bursting at our fingertips when we touch. We\nare in tune. Our hearts croon the same old song. The universe planned for us. I\nknow it. I know it. ~ Beau Taplin // In Tune</i></p><!-- more --><p>\u201cAm I right to assume that you\u2019ve gone completely insane?\u201d </p><p>Y/N smiled and glanced over her shoulder. \u201cThat depends on\nyour definition of the word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about wanting to jump into a Siberian lake during\nWinter?\u201d</p><p>Turning around to face her companion, Y/N folded her arms\nand grinned. \u201cI told you, its research.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, some research this is. You\u2019ll freeze within seconds.\nHow am I supposed to explain that to your parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dear cousin,\u201d Y/N approached him and lay a gentle hand\non his arm. \u201cMy parents don\u2019t even know I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrilliant.\u201d</p><p>Y/N smirked at his sarcastic tone and turned to walk to the\nend of the pier. Her eyes swept over the frozen expanse and her breath came out\nin puffs. \u201cI\u2019ve come this far,\u201d she murmured to herself, \u201cI can\u2019t stop now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you talking to yourself again?\u201d Her cousin\u2019s amused\ntone broke through her thoughts. </p><p>Shaking her head, Y/N took a deep breath and spoke, this\ntime loud enough for him to hear her clearly. \u201cEver since you decided to help\nme, I have kept things from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecided to help you? That\u2019s not how I remember it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegardless,\u201d Y/N turned to face him and was surprised to\nfind him only an arm\u2019s length away. \u201cI haven\u2019t told you the real reason for\neverything I\u2019ve been doing these past two years.\u201d</p><p>&ldquo;You mean you\u2019re about to tell me why you\u2019ve stolen all\nthat information ? Why you\u2019ve used your position to gain access to otherwise\nclassified and protected documents?\u201d Her cousin\u2019s blue eyes searched her face\nfor any kind of answer. </p><p>Y/N nodded. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t quite put it that way, but, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>Y/N bit her lip before letting out a shuddering breath. \u201cI\nmade a promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made a promise? A promise to what, convince the world\nyou\u2019ve lost your mind? That you\u2019ve completely lost it?\u201d The disbelief and incredulity\nin his tone was almost visible. </p><p>\u201cIt was nothing like that and you know it,\u201d Y/N was\nstruggling to stay calm.</p><p>\u201cThen please enlighten me.\u201d There was an edge to her\ncousin\u2019s voice that she had not heard before. \u201cBecause right now, I\u2019m having a\nhard time trying to understand what kind of person would require such a promise\nfrom you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe-\u201d Y/N broke off and looked down at her hands. \u201cHe didn\u2019t\nrequire anything of me. It was I who made the promise, not him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth would possess you to do such a thing?\u201d</p><p>Y/N turned away from him and moved to stand near the end of\nthe pier. She did not answer right away, her eyes fixated on the partially\nfrozen surface below. When she spoke, however, her voice was soft, like a\nbreath of wind. \u201cI love him.\u201d</p><p>Silence answered her statement. Not waiting for her cousin\nto respond, Y/N dropped the heavy coat she wore and shivered as the icy\nSiberian air hit her skin. The last thing she heard was her cousin\u2019s protests\nbefore the cold water surrounded her. </p><p>~ ~ ~ </p><p><i>\u201cLook, the sky is so beautiful tonight.\u201d Her eyes shone like\nthe stars above them.</i></p><p><i>Indeed it was, a calm quiet spring night with not even the\nslightest breeze to disturb them. </i></p><p><i>\u201cIt is times like these that make me believe we are the only\ntwo people in existence.\u201d </i></p><p><i>He soon found himself agreeing with her. Never in his life\nwould he have imagined himself to be as happy as he was with her. \u201cIf only that\nwere true.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Sighing contentedly, she lay her head on his shoulder, her\nY/F/C locks spilling over his shoulder. \u201cFor tonight, let us pretend that it\nis.\u201d </i></p><p><i>Kissing the top of her head, he rested his chin amongst her\ncoloured curls. \u201cFor you my love, I will.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go\u201d she murmured and curled an arm around\nhis waist, her face buried in his shoulder. </i></p><p><i>\u201cThen\ndon\u2019t,\u201d he whispered and held her closer. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI must,\u201d she lifted her head and met his gaze. \u201cI must keep\nthe promise I made.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat promise?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe promise to find you.\u201d</i></p><p>Blinking<i>, </i>Loki sat up. She often visited him in that\nmanner. Dreams, nightmares and visions. His escape from the isolation that was\nhis punishment. The books his mother brought soon bored him and sight of the\nsame four walls was slowly driving him mad. </p><p>The memory of her voice floated around the cell and he\nclosed his eyes in an effort to escape back to where she was. He had no such\nluck. Sighing in frustration, he bent to retrieve a discarded book when a\nsudden coldness engulfed him. A bone-chilling cold that seemed to pulse\never-so-slightly. He had never felt anything like it. </p><p>Looking at his hands, he noticed that they had not shifted\nto the blue of his natural Jotun form. Confused, he cast a reflection spell but\ndid not see himself.</p><p><i>Distorted sun rays soon made it clear that what he was\nlooking at was underwater. A figure soon came into view and Loki did not have\nto guess who that was. Her coloured hair hung suspended in the water as she\nswam. She seemed to be swimming upwards. Her hands reached the surface first.\nBut they did not pass through the water as expected. The surface was hard and\nwould not yield even when she slammed her fists against it. </i></p><p><i>It was then that the prince saw fear enter her beautiful\neyes. Her lips were clamped shut in order to preserve the precious air she had\nleft. She began to claw at the ice, her actions becoming weaker as more time\npassed. </i></p><p><i>~ ~ ~ </i></p><p>Y/N was beginning to panic<i>, </i>no matter how hard she\nhit or clawed, the ice would not give way. Surely her cousin would be hearing\nthis? Y/N was tempted to call out to him with what strength and air she had\nleft. </p><p>Her lungs were burning. The need for oxygen was becoming\nparamount. Her desperate eyes searched her surroundings and soon locked onto\nthe submerged leg of the pier. Swimming up to it, she began to claw at the ice\nsurrounding it. Still to no avail. Seeing no other options, she opened her\nmouth and screamed as best as one could underwater. \u201cNIKOLAS!\u201d A rush of\nbubbles accompanied the word. </p><p>When no immediate response came, her panic increased. Y/N\nrefused to give up. She had made a promise and she\u2019d be damned before letting\nanything make her break it. Her bruised and bloodied hands pounded on the ice\nand with fast dwindling reserves of air, she continued to call for her cousin. </p><p>~ ~ ~ </p><p>Loki hated it. Watching her trapped under ice and fighting\nto survive. He loathed how helpless he felt. Unable to help her in anyway.\nForced to stand and watch while the woman he loved could very well be living\nher last moments. </p><p>The cold had not left him. If anything, it had gotten worse.\nHe heard the fear and panic in her voice as she called for someone named\nNikolas. In any other situation, Loki would have been jealous. But now, he\nsimply prayed and begged that this person would hear her. </p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d he whispered, \u201cif you can hear me, I beg you not give\nup. I beg you to keep fighting. I beg you to live.\u201d </p><p>~ ~ ~ </p><p>She thought she was hearing things. The lack of air seemed\nto playing tricks on her oxygen-deprived brain. The voice, <i>his</i> voice,\nseemed to come from everywhere. It surrounded her with a comforting warmth and\nclosing her eyes, she saw two emerald-eyes look back at her. Pleading with her\nto keep going. </p><p><i>Open your eyes, </i>they\nseemed to say<i>, open them. Stay awake! Keep fighting. Don\u2019t you dare give up.\nWake up and keep going.</i></p><p>~ ~ ~ </p><p>Loki watched in frozen horror as her eyes remained closed\ndespite his pleas. Her hands, which had been raised to break the ice, now hung\nsuspended in the water. Her lips, a dark shade of purple, were curved in a\ngentle smile. </p><p>The prince watched in agonizing helplessness, his eyes\nscanning her for any signs of life. Even in such a state, he found himself\nmesmerised by her. Even now, he hoped and prayed that her eyes would open, that\nshe would continue to fight like the survivor he knew her to be. </p><p>\u00a0\u201cKeep fighting woman! Damn you, don\u2019t you dare stop.\u201d\nA shuddering breath escaped him. \u201cI can\u2019t lose you,\u201d he whispered, his voice\nchoked with the tears he was struggling to hold back. \u201cI won\u2019t survive.\u201d</p><p>His eyes remained trained on her, they did not leave her,\nnot even when the ice above her was finally broken. Not even when she was\nlifted into the arms of her cousin. Wrapped in thick towels and furs, Y/N was\ncarried away, her beautiful eyes closed to the world. Her elegant form limp in\nher cousin\u2019s arms. </p><p>\u201cMay we meet again, my love,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI promise you,\nthat my soul will find no rest until it has found yours.\u201d</p><p>Braving one last look at the reflection, he saw only\nhimself, and the Queen who stood silently behind him.</p><p>If his mother\u2019s presence startled him, Loki refused to show\nit. Pushing himself off the bed, he stood and faced the older woman. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d The words came out harsher than\nhe intended.</p><p>\u201cIs a mother not permitted to see her son?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou are not my mo-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not your birth mother,\u201d Frigga cut him off with a sad\nsmile. \u201cThat I know. You have reminded me many times these past two years. But\nI raised you and loved you, I still love you. That makes me as much your mother\nas the one that gave birth to you.\u201d</p><p>Loki could not find the right words to say to such a\nstatement. Turning away from her, he fought against the tears that came every\ntime she spoke that way. </p><p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d Frigga asked in a soft voice. </p><p>Loki knew full well who she was talking about. He briefly\nconsidered lying even though he knew that Frigga would easily see through him.\n\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe young woman in the reflection.\u201d</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Loki turned to face her. \u201cShe was a\nmortal I became acquainted with during my time on Midgard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mortal you say?\u201d Frigga was intrigued, to say the least.\nWhat was it about this young woman in particular that had snagged the attention\nof her younger son?\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Frigga nodded thoughtfully, her eyes never leaving him. \u201cA\nvery headstrong young woman, to be sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know such a thing?\u201d Loki narrowed his eyes at\nthe Queen and kept his tone neutral. </p><p>\u201cI do believe your brother spoke of her. A mortal woman with\nhair and eyes unlike any he has seen before. Of such a vivid colour that it\nwould be impossible to lose her within a crowd of thousands.\u201d Frigga smiled in\nmemory of Thor\u2019s description of the young lady. \u201cA mortal who valued knowledge\nabove all else.\u201d</p><p>The image of Y/N clutching her book to her chest came\nunbidden to the forefront of Loki\u2019s memory. Her Y/F/C hair was tousled from\nsleep but her eyes were bright with curiosity. </p><p><i>\u201cYou like to read?\u201d</i> He heard\nhimself ask. </p><p><i>\u201cYes. I do.\u201d</i> She\nanswered, <i>\u201cif you ask my parents, they would say I spend more time reading\nthan in the company of actual people.\u201d </i></p><p>Frigga watched her son closely. His eyes seemed to be seeing\nsomething else, something far away. A sad smile graced his features. In that\nmoment, the prince seemed to forget he had company and dropped the masks of\narrogance and indifference.</p><p>Frigga decided that perhaps it was best that she left\nwithout telling him. If memories offered him a respite from the isolation and\nloneliness, who was she to take that away from him ?</p><p>~ ~ ~ </p><p>The first thing Y/N noticed upon opening her eyes was how\nwarm it was. Her e/c eyes were immediately drawn to a large fireplace. </p><p>\u201cWelcome back to the land of the living.\u201d Her cousin knelt\nby the fire and smirked at her from over his shoulder. \u201cI hate to say it but, I\ndid say this was going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t sound like you hate to say it,\u201d Y/N shot back, her\nvoice a little hoarse. Her eyes sparkled with mischief despite her weakened\nstate. </p><p>\u201cOh no you don\u2019t,\u201d Nikolas left the fire and came to sit on\nthe bed beside her. \u201cYou almost drowned in a partially frozen lake, you\u2019re not\ngoing anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even say anything,\u201d she protested and grinned. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d Nikolas tried and failed to look\nserious. The relief he felt at seeing her awake was evident. \u201cYou gave me a\nreal scare there cuz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did?\u201d She seemed genuinely surprised. </p><p>\u201cSure you did,\u201d Nikolas reached out and wrapped an arm\naround her shoulders. \u201cWhen I heard you calling my name from under the ice, I\nthought I was imagining things. But when I saw you there, floating beneath the ice with your eyes closed, I feared the worst.\u201d<br/></p><p>Y/N snuggled in closer, grateful for the familiarity that\ncame from family. \u201cHow exactly did you break through all that ice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hit the ice more times than I\u2019d like to count, until\nfinally I broke through and pulled you out.\u201d He looked down and gently rubbed\nher arm, as though he was remembering how cold she had felt that day, her lips\na dark shade of purple and her skin pale.</p><p>\u201cDid you find what you were looking for?\u201d Nikolas asked,\nchanging the topic slightly. </p><p>Y/N shook her head. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t there. I mean, it was once,\nbut someone must have come before me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo you know who it could be?\u201d Nikolas had no idea why he\nwas even encouraging this. </p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t answer right away. Her eyes narrowed in thought\nbefore widening as her mind locked onto an idea. \u201cSHIELD. They took it. They\nmust have.\u201d The conviction in her voice startled her cousin. </p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d </p><p>She nodded, \u201cpositive. Think Nikolas, who else could it\nbe?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh gee,\u201d her cousin got up and returned to the fire. \u201cThere\ncould be any number of people out there, looking for the same thing as you.\nBesides,\u201d he turned back to her, \u201cwhat was it you were looking for anyway? It\nmust have been pretty important for you to knowingly risk your life like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA stone? You almost drowned for a stone?\u201d </p><p>Y/N nodded, her eyes seemed to go distant. \u201cThis stone was\nthe last piece, the piece I have been looking for. The key to fulfilling the\npromise I made and have every intention of keeping.\u201d</p><p>Nikolas narrowed his eyes and stared at her intently. \u201cWhat\nis so special about this stone exactly ?\u201d</p><p>Y/N smiled and met his piercing blue gaze. \u201cIt is known as\nthe Stone of Transcendence.\u201d</p><p>Nikolas blinked, perplexed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is said,\u201d Y/N continued, \u201cthat this stone would allow\nit\u2019s bearer to go beyond the limits and reaches of this world. Legend has it,\nthat it bore the ability to open the doorway to other worlds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther worlds?\u201d Nikolas wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d heard correctly. </p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her eyes seemed to come back to the present. \u201cI was <i>this</i>\nclose Nikolas,\u201d she emphasised, \u201cthis damn close and those bastards came and\nstole my last chance at finding him.\u201d The passion and anger in her voice\nsurprised her cousin. \u201cIt\u2019s so bloody typical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust who is this person you keep talking about?\u201d </p><p>A small smile blossomed on her features. Her earlier anger\nseemingly forgotten. \u201cLoki. His name is Loki.\u201d</p><p>Now Nikolas was convinced, his dear cousin had finally lost\nher mind. \u201cLoki ? as in <i>the</i> Loki? The one from Norse Mythology? The one\nthat attacked New York two years ago?\u201d</p><p>Y/N nodded, her smile fading a little. \u201cTo be fair, my dear\ncousin, he never actually went through with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh I\u2019m sorry, the one that <i>tried</i> to attack New\nYork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t like the answer, but you quite\nliterally asked for it,\u201d Y/N reminded him. </p><p>Nikolas said nothing, he simply shook his head and turned\nhis attention back to the crackling flames in the fireplace. </p><p>\u201cI need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy help?\u201d Nikolas spoke, remaining in the same position.\n\u201cWhat could you possibly need my help for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting the stone back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He stood up and faced her, \u201cabsolutely not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just being petty now,\u201d Y/N grinned up at her\nstone-faced cousin. \u201cYou\u2019re an intelligence agent, this is quite literally what\nyou do.\u201d</p><p>Nikolas stared at her as though she had grown a third eye.\n\u201cI\u2019m a spy, yes, but not a thief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry dear cousin,\u201d Y/N met his eyes, \u201cbut I do not see\nthe difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to be forgetting a very important aspect of all of\nthis.\u201d</p><p>Y/N raised her eyebrows and gestured for him to continue.\n\u201cAnd that would be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m <i>Russian</i> intelligence and you want me to steal\nsomething from an <i>American </i>intelligence organisation. How does that not\nspell <i>trouble</i>?\u201d</p><p>Y/N crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cSince when have you\nevery backed down in the face of a challenge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a challenge Y/N,\u201d Nikolas tried to reason with\nher. \u201cIf anything goes wrong, America will blame Russia and we\u2019ll have Cold War\n2.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh please,\u201d Y/N rolled her eyes, \u201cthere is no need to be so\ndramatic. This is hardly a war declaration. You\u2019re simply helping me get back\nsomething that was stolen from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you never had it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnicalities,\u201d Y/N dismissed with a small wave, \u201cthe\npoint is, they took it because they knew I was looking for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea what you sound like?\u201d </p><p>\u201cLike a mad genius?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou got the mad part right,\u201d Nickolas shook his head and\nran a hand through his hair. </p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Y/N\u2019s eyes sparkled, \u201care you in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, did you not hear a word of what I just said?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and grinned, \u201csure I did.\u201d</p><p>Nikolas soon found himself returning the expression and\nsmiled down at her. \u201cThis plan of yours will most likely get us caught or\nkilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know you\u2019re so confident in both of our abilities,\u201d\nY/N smirked. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not try and start a war alright?\u201d</p><p>Y/N nodded, her smirk widening. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><i><b>To be continued&hellip;.</b></i></p><p><a href=\"http://crystal-siren.tumblr.com/post/175569954732/knowledge-dadtony-x-reader-loki-x-reader-pt\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Part 4</b></a><br/></p>",

You\u2019ll freeze within seconds.\nHow am I supposed to explain that to your parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dear cousin,\u201d Y/N approached him and lay a gentle hand\non his arm. \u201cMy parents don\u2019t even know I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrilliant.\u201d</p><p>Y/N smirked at his sarcastic tone and turned to walk to the\nend of the pier. Her eyes swept over the frozen expanse and her breath came out\nin puffs. \u201cI\u2019ve come this far,\u201d she murmured to herself, \u201cI can\u2019t stop now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you talking to yourself again?\u201d Her cousin\u2019s amused\ntone broke through her thoughts. </p><p>Shaking her head, Y/N took a deep breath and spoke, this\ntime loud enough for him to hear her clearly. \u201cEver since you decided to help\nme, I have kept things from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecided to help you? That\u2019s not how I remember it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegardless,\u201d Y/N turned to face him and was surprised to\nfind him only an arm\u2019s length away. \u201cI haven\u2019t told you the real reason for\neverything I\u2019ve been doing these past two years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you\u2019re about to tell me why you\u2019ve stolen all\nthat information ? Why you\u2019ve used your position to gain access to otherwise\nclassified and protected documents?\u201d Her cousin\u2019s blue eyes searched her face\nfor any kind of answer. </p><p>Y/N nodded. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t quite put it that way, but, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>Y/N bit her lip before letting out a shuddering breath. \u201cI\nmade a promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made a promise? A promise to what, convince the world\nyou\u2019ve lost your mind? That you\u2019ve completely lost it?\u201d The disbelief and incredulity\nin his tone was almost visible. </p><p>\u201cIt was nothing like that and you know it,\u201d Y/N was\nstruggling to stay calm.</p><p>\u201cThen please enlighten me.\u201d There was an edge to her\ncousin\u2019s voice that she had not heard before. \u201cBecause right now, I\u2019m having a\nhard time trying to understand what kind of person would require such a promise\nfrom you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe-\u201d Y/N broke off and looked down at her hands. \u201cHe didn\u2019t\nrequire anything of me. It was I who made the promise, not him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth would possess you to do such a thing?\u201d</p><p>Y/N turned away from him and moved to stand near the end of\nthe pier. She did not answer right away, her eyes fixated on the partially\nfrozen surface below. When she spoke, however, her voice was soft, like a\nbreath of wind. \u201cI love him.\u201d</p><p>Silence answered her statement. Not waiting for her cousin\nto respond, Y/N dropped the heavy coat she wore and shivered as the icy\nSiberian air hit her skin. The last thing she heard was her cousin\u2019s protests\nbefore the cold water surrounded her. </p><p>~ ~ ~ </p><p><i>\u201cLook, the sky is so beautiful tonight.\u201d Her eyes shone like\nthe stars above them.</i></p><p><i>Indeed it was, a calm quiet spring night with not even the\nslightest breeze to disturb them. </i></p><p><i>\u201cIt is times like these that make me believe we are the only\ntwo people in existence.\u201d </i></p><p><i>He soon found himself agreeing with her. Never in his life\nwould he have imagined himself to be as happy as he was with her. \u201cIf only that\nwere true.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Sighing contentedly, she lay her head on his shoulder, her\nY/F/C locks spilling over his shoulder. \u201cFor tonight, let us pretend that it\nis.\u201d </i></p><p><i>Kissing the top of her head, he rested his chin amongst her\ncoloured curls. \u201cFor you my love, I will.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go\u201d she murmured and curled an arm around\nhis waist, her face buried in his shoulder. </i></p><p><i>\u201cThen\ndon\u2019t,\u201d he whispered and held her closer. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI must,\u201d she lifted her head and met his gaze. \u201cI must keep\nthe promise I made.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat promise?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe promise to find you.\u201d</i></p><p>Blinking<i>, </i>Loki sat up. She often visited him in that\nmanner. Dreams, nightmares and visions. His escape from the isolation that was\nhis punishment. The books his mother brought soon bored him and sight of the\nsame four walls was slowly driving him mad. </p><p>The memory of her voice floated around the cell and he\nclosed his eyes in an effort to escape back to where she was. He had no such\nluck. Sighing in frustration, he bent to retrieve a discarded book when a\nsudden coldness engulfed him. A bone-chilling cold that seemed to pulse\never-so-slightly. He had never felt anything like it. </p><p>Looking at his hands, he noticed that they had not shifted\nto the blue of his natural Jotun form. Confused, he cast a reflection spell but\ndid not see himself.</p><p><i>Distorted sun rays soon made it clear that what he was\nlooking at was underwater. A figure soon came into view and Loki did not have\nto guess who that was. Her coloured hair hung suspended in the water as she\nswam. She seemed to be swimming upwards. Her hands reached the surface first.\nBut they did not pass through the water as expected. The surface was hard and\nwould not yield even when she slammed her fists against it. </i></p><p><i>It was then that the prince saw fear enter her beautiful\neyes. Her lips were clamped shut in order to preserve the precious air she had\nleft. She began to claw at the ice, her actions becoming weaker as more time\npassed. </i></p><p><i>~ ~ ~ </i></p><p>Y/N was beginning to panic<i>, </i>no matter how hard she\nhit or clawed, the ice would not give way. Surely her cousin would be hearing\nthis? Y/N was tempted to call out to him with what strength and air she had\nleft. </p><p>Her lungs were burning. The need for oxygen was becoming\nparamount. Her desperate eyes searched her surroundings and soon locked onto\nthe submerged leg of the pier. Swimming up to it, she began to claw at the ice\nsurrounding it. Still to no avail. Seeing no other options, she opened her\nmouth and screamed as best as one could underwater. \u201cNIKOLAS!\u201d A rush of\nbubbles accompanied the word. </p><p>When no immediate response came, her panic increased. Y/N\nrefused to give up. She had made a promise and she\u2019d be damned before letting\nanything make her break it. Her bruised and bloodied hands pounded on the ice\nand with fast dwindling reserves of air, she continued to call for her cousin. </p><p>~ ~ ~ </p><p>Loki hated it. Watching her trapped under ice and fighting\nto survive. He loathed how helpless he felt. Unable to help her in anyway.\nForced to stand and watch while the woman he loved could very well be living\nher last moments. </p><p>The cold had not left him. If anything, it had gotten worse.\nHe heard the fear and panic in her voice as she called for someone named\nNikolas. In any other situation, Loki would have been jealous. But now, he\nsimply prayed and begged that this person would hear her. </p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d he whispered, \u201cif you can hear me, I beg you not give\nup. I beg you to keep fighting. I beg you to live.\u201d </p><p>~ ~ ~ </p><p>She thought she was hearing things. The lack of air seemed\nto playing tricks on her oxygen-deprived brain. The voice, <i>his</i> voice,\nseemed to come from everywhere. It surrounded her with a comforting warmth and\nclosing her eyes, she saw two emerald-eyes look back at her. Pleading with her\nto keep going. </p><p><i>Open your eyes, </i>they\nseemed to say<i>, open them. Stay awake! Keep fighting. Don\u2019t you dare give up.\nWake up and keep going.</i></p><p>~ ~ ~ </p><p>Loki watched in frozen horror as her eyes remained closed\ndespite his pleas. Her hands, which had been raised to break the ice, now hung\nsuspended in the water. Her lips, a dark shade of purple, were curved in a\ngentle smile. </p><p>The prince watched in agonizing helplessness, his eyes\nscanning her for any signs of life. Even in such a state, he found himself\nmesmerised by her. Even now, he hoped and prayed that her eyes would open, that\nshe would continue to fight like the survivor he knew her to be. </p><p>\u00a0\u201cKeep fighting woman! Damn you, don\u2019t you dare stop.\u201d\nA shuddering breath escaped him. \u201cI can\u2019t lose you,\u201d he whispered, his voice\nchoked with the tears he was struggling to hold back. \u201cI won\u2019t survive.\u201d</p><p>His eyes remained trained on her, they did not leave her,\nnot even when the ice above her was finally broken. Not even when she was\nlifted into the arms of her cousin. Wrapped in thick towels and furs, Y/N was\ncarried away, her beautiful eyes closed to the world. Her elegant form limp in\nher cousin\u2019s arms. </p><p>\u201cMay we meet again, my love,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI promise you,\nthat my soul will find no rest until it has found yours.\u201d</p><p>Braving one last look at the reflection, he saw only\nhimself, and the Queen who stood silently behind him.</p><p>If his mother\u2019s presence startled him, Loki refused to show\nit. Pushing himself off the bed, he stood and faced the older woman. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d The words came out harsher than\nhe intended.</p><p>\u201cIs a mother not permitted to see her son?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou are not my mo-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not your birth mother,\u201d Frigga cut him off with a sad\nsmile. \u201cThat I know. You have reminded me many times these past two years. But\nI raised you and loved you, I still love you. That makes me as much your mother\nas the one that gave birth to you.\u201d</p><p>Loki could not find the right words to say to such a\nstatement. Turning away from her, he fought against the tears that came every\ntime she spoke that way. </p><p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d Frigga asked in a soft voice. </p><p>Loki knew full well who she was talking about. He briefly\nconsidered lying even though he knew that Frigga would easily see through him.\n\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe young woman in the reflection.\u201d</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Loki turned to face her. \u201cShe was a\nmortal I became acquainted with during my time on Midgard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mortal you say?\u201d Frigga was intrigued, to say the least.\nWhat was it about this young woman in particular that had snagged the attention\nof her younger son?\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Frigga nodded thoughtfully, her eyes never leaving him. \u201cA\nvery headstrong young woman, to be sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know such a thing?\u201d Loki narrowed his eyes at\nthe Queen and kept his tone neutral. </p><p>\u201cI do believe your brother spoke of her. A mortal woman with\nhair and eyes unlike any he has seen before. Of such a vivid colour that it\nwould be impossible to lose her within a crowd of thousands.\u201d Frigga smiled in\nmemory of Thor\u2019s description of the young lady. \u201cA mortal who valued knowledge\nabove all else.\u201d</p><p>The image of Y/N clutching her book to her chest came\nunbidden to the forefront of Loki\u2019s memory. Her Y/F/C hair was tousled from\nsleep but her eyes were bright with curiosity. </p><p><i>\u201cYou like to read?\u201d</i> He heard\nhimself ask. </p><p><i>\u201cYes. I do.\u201d</i> She\nanswered, <i>\u201cif you ask my parents, they would say I spend more time reading\nthan in the company of actual people.\u201d </i></p><p>Frigga watched her son closely. His eyes seemed to be seeing\nsomething else, something far away. A sad smile graced his features. In that\nmoment, the prince seemed to forget he had company and dropped the masks of\narrogance and indifference.</p><p>Frigga decided that perhaps it was best that she left\nwithout telling him. If memories offered him a respite from the isolation and\nloneliness, who was she to take that away from him ?</p><p>~ ~ ~ </p><p>The first thing Y/N noticed upon opening her eyes was how\nwarm it was. Her e/c eyes were immediately drawn to a large fireplace. </p><p>\u201cWelcome back to the land of the living.\u201d Her cousin knelt\nby the fire and smirked at her from over his shoulder. \u201cI hate to say it but, I\ndid say this was going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t sound like you hate to say it,\u201d Y/N shot back, her\nvoice a little hoarse. Her eyes sparkled with mischief despite her weakened\nstate. </p><p>\u201cOh no you don\u2019t,\u201d Nikolas left the fire and came to sit on\nthe bed beside her. \u201cYou almost drowned in a partially frozen lake, you\u2019re not\ngoing anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even say anything,\u201d she protested and grinned. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d Nikolas tried and failed to look\nserious. The relief he felt at seeing her awake was evident. \u201cYou gave me a\nreal scare there cuz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did?\u201d She seemed genuinely surprised. </p><p>\u201cSure you did,\u201d Nikolas reached out and wrapped an arm\naround her shoulders. \u201cWhen I heard you calling my name from under the ice, I\nthought I was imagining things. But when I saw you there, floating beneath the ice with your eyes closed, I feared the worst.\u201d<br></p><p>Y/N snuggled in closer, grateful for the familiarity that\ncame from family. \u201cHow exactly did you break through all that ice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hit the ice more times than I\u2019d like to count, until\nfinally I broke through and pulled you out.\u201d He looked down and gently rubbed\nher arm, as though he was remembering how cold she had felt that day, her lips\na dark shade of purple and her skin pale.</p><p>\u201cDid you find what you were looking for?\u201d Nikolas asked,\nchanging the topic slightly. </p><p>Y/N shook her head. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t there. I mean, it was once,\nbut someone must have come before me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo you know who it could be?\u201d Nikolas had no idea why he\nwas even encouraging this. </p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t answer right away. Her eyes narrowed in thought\nbefore widening as her mind locked onto an idea. \u201cSHIELD. They took it. They\nmust have.\u201d The conviction in her voice startled her cousin. </p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d </p><p>She nodded, \u201cpositive. Think Nikolas, who else could it\nbe?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh gee,\u201d her cousin got up and returned to the fire. \u201cThere\ncould be any number of people out there, looking for the same thing as you.\nBesides,\u201d he turned back to her, \u201cwhat was it you were looking for anyway? It\nmust have been pretty important for you to knowingly risk your life like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA stone? You almost drowned for a stone?\u201d </p><p>Y/N nodded, her eyes seemed to go distant. \u201cThis stone was\nthe last piece, the piece I have been looking for. The key to fulfilling the\npromise I made and have every intention of keeping.\u201d</p><p>Nikolas narrowed his eyes and stared at her intently. \u201cWhat\nis so special about this stone exactly ?\u201d</p><p>Y/N smiled and met his piercing blue gaze. \u201cIt is known as\nthe Stone of Transcendence.\u201d</p><p>Nikolas blinked, perplexed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is said,\u201d Y/N continued, \u201cthat this stone would allow\nit\u2019s bearer to go beyond the limits and reaches of this world. Legend has it,\nthat it bore the ability to open the doorway to other worlds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther worlds?\u201d Nikolas wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d heard correctly. </p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her eyes seemed to come back to the present. \u201cI was <i>this</i>\nclose Nikolas,\u201d she emphasised, \u201cthis damn close and those bastards came and\nstole my last chance at finding him.\u201d The passion and anger in her voice\nsurprised her cousin. \u201cIt\u2019s so bloody typical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust who is this person you keep talking about?\u201d </p><p>A small smile blossomed on her features. Her earlier anger\nseemingly forgotten. \u201cLoki. His name is Loki.\u201d</p><p>Now Nikolas was convinced, his dear cousin had finally lost\nher mind. \u201cLoki ? as in <i>the</i> Loki? The one from Norse Mythology? The one\nthat attacked New York two years ago?\u201d</p><p>Y/N nodded, her smile fading a little. \u201cTo be fair, my dear\ncousin, he never actually went through with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh I\u2019m sorry, the one that <i>tried</i> to attack New\nYork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t like the answer, but you quite\nliterally asked for it,\u201d Y/N reminded him. </p><p>Nikolas said nothing, he simply shook his head and turned\nhis attention back to the crackling flames in the fireplace. </p><p>\u201cI need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy help?\u201d Nikolas spoke, remaining in the same position.\n\u201cWhat could you possibly need my help for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting the stone back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He stood up and faced her, \u201cabsolutely not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just being petty now,\u201d Y/N grinned up at her\nstone-faced cousin. \u201cYou\u2019re an intelligence agent, this is quite literally what\nyou do.\u201d</p><p>Nikolas stared at her as though she had grown a third eye.\n\u201cI\u2019m a spy, yes, but not a thief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry dear cousin,\u201d Y/N met his eyes, \u201cbut I do not see\nthe difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to be forgetting a very important aspect of all of\nthis.\u201d</p><p>Y/N raised her eyebrows and gestured for him to continue.\n\u201cAnd that would be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m <i>Russian</i> intelligence and you want me to steal\nsomething from an <i>American </i>intelligence organisation. How does that not\nspell <i>trouble</i>?\u201d</p><p>Y/N crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cSince when have you\nevery backed down in the face of a challenge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a challenge Y/N,\u201d Nikolas tried to reason with\nher. \u201cIf anything goes wrong, America will blame Russia and we\u2019ll have Cold War\n2.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh please,\u201d Y/N rolled her eyes, \u201cthere is no need to be so\ndramatic. This is hardly a war declaration. You\u2019re simply helping me get back\nsomething that was stolen from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you never had it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnicalities,\u201d Y/N dismissed with a small wave, \u201cthe\npoint is, they took it because they knew I was looking for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea what you sound like?\u201d </p><p>\u201cLike a mad genius?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou got the mad part right,\u201d Nickolas shook his head and\nran a hand through his hair. </p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Y/N\u2019s eyes sparkled, \u201care you in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, did you not hear a word of what I just said?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and grinned, \u201csure I did.\u201d</p><p>Nikolas soon found himself returning the expression and\nsmiled down at her. \u201cThis plan of yours will most likely get us caught or\nkilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know you\u2019re so confident in both of our abilities,\u201d\nY/N smirked. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not try and start a war alright?\u201d</p><p>Y/N nodded, her smirk widening. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><i><b>To be continued\u2026.</b></i></p><p><a href=\"http://crystal-siren.tumblr.com/post/175569954732/knowledge-dadtony-x-reader-loki-x-reader-pt\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Part 4</b></a><br></p>",

Something deeply\nspiritual. The way we fall in one another so naturally like our love carved of\nthe earth. There are star systems bursting at our fingertips when we touch. We\nare in tune. Our hearts croon the same old song. The universe planned for us. I\nknow it. I know it. ~ Beau Taplin // In Tune</i></p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cAm I right to assume that you\u2019ve gone completely insane?\u201d </p><p>Y/N smiled and glanced over her shoulder. \u201cThat depends on\nyour definition of the word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about wanting to jump into a Siberian lake during\nWinter?\u201d</p><p>Turning around to face her companion, Y/N folded her arms\nand grinned. \u201cI told you, its research.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, some research this is. You\u2019ll freeze within seconds.\nHow am I supposed to explain that to your parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dear cousin,\u201d Y/N approached him and lay a gentle hand\non his arm. \u201cMy parents don\u2019t even know I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrilliant.\u201d</p><p>Y/N smirked at his sarcastic tone and turned to walk to the\nend of the pier. Her eyes swept over the frozen expanse and her breath came out\nin puffs. \u201cI\u2019ve come this far,\u201d she murmured to herself, \u201cI can\u2019t stop now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you talking to yourself again?\u201d Her cousin\u2019s amused\ntone broke through her thoughts. </p><p>Shaking her head, Y/N took a deep breath and spoke, this\ntime loud enough for him to hear her clearly. \u201cEver since you decided to help\nme, I have kept things from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecided to help you? That\u2019s not how I remember it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegardless,\u201d Y/N turned to face him and was surprised to\nfind him only an arm\u2019s length away. \u201cI haven\u2019t told you the real reason for\neverything I\u2019ve been doing these past two years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you\u2019re about to tell me why you\u2019ve stolen all\nthat information ? Why you\u2019ve used your position to gain access to otherwise\nclassified and protected documents?\u201d Her cousin\u2019s blue eyes searched her face\nfor any kind of answer. </p><p>Y/N nodded. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t quite put it that way, but, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>Y/N bit her lip before letting out a shuddering breath. \u201cI\nmade a promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made a promise? A promise to what, convince the world\nyou\u2019ve lost your mind? That you\u2019ve completely lost it?\u201d The disbelief and incredulity\nin his tone was almost visible. </p><p>\u201cIt was nothing like that and you know it,\u201d Y/N was\nstruggling to stay calm.</p><p>\u201cThen please enlighten me.\u201d There was an edge to her\ncousin\u2019s voice that she had not heard before. \u201cBecause right now, I\u2019m having a\nhard time trying to understand what kind of person would require such a promise\nfrom you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe-\u201d Y/N broke off and looked down at her hands. \u201cHe didn\u2019t\nrequire anything of me. It was I who made the promise, not him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth would possess you to do such a thing?\u201d</p><p>Y/N turned away from him and moved to stand near the end of\nthe pier. She did not answer right away, her eyes fixated on the partially\nfrozen surface below. When she spoke, however, her voice was soft, like a\nbreath of wind. \u201cI love him.\u201d</p><p>Silence answered her statement. Not waiting for her cousin\nto respond, Y/N dropped the heavy coat she wore and shivered as the icy\nSiberian air hit her skin. The last thing she heard was her cousin\u2019s protests\nbefore the cold water surrounded her. </p><p>~ ~ ~ </p><p><i>\u201cLook, the sky is so beautiful tonight.\u201d Her eyes shone like\nthe stars above them.</i></p><p><i>Indeed it was, a calm quiet spring night with not even the\nslightest breeze to disturb them. </i></p><p><i>\u201cIt is times like these that make me believe we are the only\ntwo people in existence.\u201d </i></p><p><i>He soon found himself agreeing with her. Never in his life\nwould he have imagined himself to be as happy as he was with her. \u201cIf only that\nwere true.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Sighing contentedly, she lay her head on his shoulder, her\nY/F/C locks spilling over his shoulder. \u201cFor tonight, let us pretend that it\nis.\u201d </i></p><p><i>Kissing the top of her head, he rested his chin amongst her\ncoloured curls. \u201cFor you my love, I will.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go\u201d she murmured and curled an arm around\nhis waist, her face buried in his shoulder. </i></p><p><i>\u201cThen\ndon\u2019t,\u201d he whispered and held her closer. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI must,\u201d she lifted her head and met his gaze. \u201cI must keep\nthe promise I made.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat promise?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe promise to find you.\u201d</i></p><p>Blinking<i>, </i>Loki sat up. She often visited him in that\nmanner. Dreams, nightmares and visions. His escape from the isolation that was\nhis punishment. The books his mother brought soon bored him and sight of the\nsame four walls was slowly driving him mad. </p><p>The memory of her voice floated around the cell and he\nclosed his eyes in an effort to escape back to where she was. He had no such\nluck. Sighing in frustration, he bent to retrieve a discarded book when a\nsudden coldness engulfed him. A bone-chilling cold that seemed to pulse\never-so-slightly. He had never felt anything like it. </p><p>Looking at his hands, he noticed that they had not shifted\nto the blue of his natural Jotun form. Confused, he cast a reflection spell but\ndid not see himself.</p><p><i>Distorted sun rays soon made it clear that what he was\nlooking at was underwater. A figure soon came into view and Loki did not have\nto guess who that was. Her coloured hair hung suspended in the water as she\nswam. She seemed to be swimming upwards. Her hands reached the surface first.\nBut they did not pass through the water as expected. The surface was hard and\nwould not yield even when she slammed her fists against it. </i></p><p><i>It was then that the prince saw fear enter her beautiful\neyes. Her lips were clamped shut in order to preserve the precious air she had\nleft. She began to claw at the ice, her actions becoming weaker as more time\npassed. </i></p><p><i>~ ~ ~ </i></p><p>Y/N was beginning to panic<i>, </i>no matter how hard she\nhit or clawed, the ice would not give way. Surely her cousin would be hearing\nthis? Y/N was tempted to call out to him with what strength and air she had\nleft. </p><p>Her lungs were burning. The need for oxygen was becoming\nparamount. Her desperate eyes searched her surroundings and soon locked onto\nthe submerged leg of the pier. Swimming up to it, she began to claw at the ice\nsurrounding it. Still to no avail. Seeing no other options, she opened her\nmouth and screamed as best as one could underwater. \u201cNIKOLAS!\u201d A rush of\nbubbles accompanied the word. </p><p>When no immediate response came, her panic increased. Y/N\nrefused to give up. She had made a promise and she\u2019d be damned before letting\nanything make her break it. Her bruised and bloodied hands pounded on the ice\nand with fast dwindling reserves of air, she continued to call for her cousin. </p><p>~ ~ ~ </p><p>Loki hated it. Watching her trapped under ice and fighting\nto survive. He loathed how helpless he felt. Unable to help her in anyway.\nForced to stand and watch while the woman he loved could very well be living\nher last moments. </p><p>The cold had not left him. If anything, it had gotten worse.\nHe heard the fear and panic in her voice as she called for someone named\nNikolas. In any other situation, Loki would have been jealous. But now, he\nsimply prayed and begged that this person would hear her. </p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d he whispered, \u201cif you can hear me, I beg you not give\nup. I beg you to keep fighting. I beg you to live.\u201d </p><p>~ ~ ~ </p><p>She thought she was hearing things. The lack of air seemed\nto playing tricks on her oxygen-deprived brain. The voice, <i>his</i> voice,\nseemed to come from everywhere. It surrounded her with a comforting warmth and\nclosing her eyes, she saw two emerald-eyes look back at her. Pleading with her\nto keep going. </p><p><i>Open your eyes, </i>they\nseemed to say<i>, open them. Stay awake! Keep fighting. Don\u2019t you dare give up.\nWake up and keep going.</i></p><p>~ ~ ~ </p><p>Loki watched in frozen horror as her eyes remained closed\ndespite his pleas. Her hands, which had been raised to break the ice, now hung\nsuspended in the water. Her lips, a dark shade of purple, were curved in a\ngentle smile. </p><p>The prince watched in agonizing helplessness, his eyes\nscanning her for any signs of life. Even in such a state, he found himself\nmesmerised by her. Even now, he hoped and prayed that her eyes would open, that\nshe would continue to fight like the survivor he knew her to be. </p><p>\u00a0\u201cKeep fighting woman! Damn you, don\u2019t you dare stop.\u201d\nA shuddering breath escaped him. \u201cI can\u2019t lose you,\u201d he whispered, his voice\nchoked with the tears he was struggling to hold back. \u201cI won\u2019t survive.\u201d</p><p>His eyes remained trained on her, they did not leave her,\nnot even when the ice above her was finally broken. Not even when she was\nlifted into the arms of her cousin. Wrapped in thick towels and furs, Y/N was\ncarried away, her beautiful eyes closed to the world. Her elegant form limp in\nher cousin\u2019s arms. </p><p>\u201cMay we meet again, my love,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI promise you,\nthat my soul will find no rest until it has found yours.\u201d</p><p>Braving one last look at the reflection, he saw only\nhimself, and the Queen who stood silently behind him.</p><p>If his mother\u2019s presence startled him, Loki refused to show\nit. Pushing himself off the bed, he stood and faced the older woman. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d The words came out harsher than\nhe intended.</p><p>\u201cIs a mother not permitted to see her son?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou are not my mo-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not your birth mother,\u201d Frigga cut him off with a sad\nsmile. \u201cThat I know. You have reminded me many times these past two years. But\nI raised you and loved you, I still love you. That makes me as much your mother\nas the one that gave birth to you.\u201d</p><p>Loki could not find the right words to say to such a\nstatement. Turning away from her, he fought against the tears that came every\ntime she spoke that way. </p><p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d Frigga asked in a soft voice. </p><p>Loki knew full well who she was talking about. He briefly\nconsidered lying even though he knew that Frigga would easily see through him.\n\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe young woman in the reflection.\u201d</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Loki turned to face her. \u201cShe was a\nmortal I became acquainted with during my time on Midgard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mortal you say?\u201d Frigga was intrigued, to say the least.\nWhat was it about this young woman in particular that had snagged the attention\nof her younger son?\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Frigga nodded thoughtfully, her eyes never leaving him. \u201cA\nvery headstrong young woman, to be sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know such a thing?\u201d Loki narrowed his eyes at\nthe Queen and kept his tone neutral. </p><p>\u201cI do believe your brother spoke of her. A mortal woman with\nhair and eyes unlike any he has seen before. Of such a vivid colour that it\nwould be impossible to lose her within a crowd of thousands.\u201d Frigga smiled in\nmemory of Thor\u2019s description of the young lady. \u201cA mortal who valued knowledge\nabove all else.\u201d</p><p>The image of Y/N clutching her book to her chest came\nunbidden to the forefront of Loki\u2019s memory. Her Y/F/C hair was tousled from\nsleep but her eyes were bright with curiosity. </p><p><i>\u201cYou like to read?\u201d</i> He heard\nhimself ask. </p><p><i>\u201cYes. I do.\u201d</i> She\nanswered, <i>\u201cif you ask my parents, they would say I spend more time reading\nthan in the company of actual people.\u201d </i></p><p>Frigga watched her son closely. His eyes seemed to be seeing\nsomething else, something far away. A sad smile graced his features. In that\nmoment, the prince seemed to forget he had company and dropped the masks of\narrogance and indifference.</p><p>Frigga decided that perhaps it was best that she left\nwithout telling him. If memories offered him a respite from the isolation and\nloneliness, who was she to take that away from him ?</p><p>~ ~ ~ </p><p>The first thing Y/N noticed upon opening her eyes was how\nwarm it was. Her e/c eyes were immediately drawn to a large fireplace. </p><p>\u201cWelcome back to the land of the living.\u201d Her cousin knelt\nby the fire and smirked at her from over his shoulder. \u201cI hate to say it but, I\ndid say this was going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t sound like you hate to say it,\u201d Y/N shot back, her\nvoice a little hoarse. Her eyes sparkled with mischief despite her weakened\nstate. </p><p>\u201cOh no you don\u2019t,\u201d Nikolas left the fire and came to sit on\nthe bed beside her. \u201cYou almost drowned in a partially frozen lake, you\u2019re not\ngoing anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even say anything,\u201d she protested and grinned. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d Nikolas tried and failed to look\nserious.

The key to fulfilling the\npromise I made and have every intention of keeping.\u201d</p><p>Nikolas narrowed his eyes and stared at her intently. \u201cWhat\nis so special about this stone exactly ?\u201d</p><p>Y/N smiled and met his piercing blue gaze. \u201cIt is known as\nthe Stone of Transcendence.\u201d</p><p>Nikolas blinked, perplexed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is said,\u201d Y/N continued, \u201cthat this stone would allow\nit\u2019s bearer to go beyond the limits and reaches of this world.

Her earlier anger\nseemingly forgotten. \u201cLoki. His name is Loki.\u201d</p><p>Now Nikolas was convinced, his dear cousin had finally lost\nher mind. \u201cLoki ? as in <i>the</i> Loki? The one from Norse Mythology? The one\nthat attacked New York two years ago?\u201d</p><p>Y/N nodded, her smile fading a little. \u201cTo be fair, my dear\ncousin, he never actually went through with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh I\u2019m sorry, the one that <i>tried</i> to attack New\nYork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t like the answer, but you quite\nliterally asked for it,\u201d Y/N reminded him. </p><p>Nikolas said nothing, he simply shook his head and turned\nhis attention back to the crackling flames in the fireplace. </p><p>\u201cI need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy help?\u201d Nikolas spoke, remaining in the same position.\n\u201cWhat could you possibly need my help for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting the stone back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He stood up and faced her, \u201cabsolutely not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just being petty now,\u201d Y/N grinned up at her\nstone-faced cousin. \u201cYou\u2019re an intelligence agent, this is quite literally what\nyou do.\u201d</p><p>Nikolas stared at her as though she had grown a third eye.\n\u201cI\u2019m a spy, yes, but not a thief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry dear cousin,\u201d Y/N met his eyes, \u201cbut I do not see\nthe difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to be forgetting a very important aspect of all of\nthis.\u201d</p><p>Y/N raised her eyebrows and gestured for him to continue.\n\u201cAnd that would be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m <i>Russian</i> intelligence and you want me to steal\nsomething from an <i>American </i>intelligence organisation. How does that not\nspell <i>trouble</i>?\u201d</p><p>Y/N crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cSince when have you\nevery backed down in the face of a challenge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a challenge Y/N,\u201d Nikolas tried to reason with\nher. \u201cIf anything goes wrong, America will blame Russia and we\u2019ll have Cold War\n2.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh please,\u201d Y/N rolled her eyes, \u201cthere is no need to be so\ndramatic. This is hardly a war declaration. You\u2019re simply helping me get back\nsomething that was stolen from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you never had it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnicalities,\u201d Y/N dismissed with a small wave, \u201cthe\npoint is, they took it because they knew I was looking for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea what you sound like?\u201d </p><p>\u201cLike a mad genius?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou got the mad part right,\u201d Nickolas shook his head and\nran a hand through his hair. </p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Y/N\u2019s eyes sparkled, \u201care you in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, did you not hear a word of what I just said?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and grinned, \u201csure I did.\u201d</p><p>Nikolas soon found himself returning the expression and\nsmiled down at her. \u201cThis plan of yours will most likely get us caught or\nkilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know you\u2019re so confident in both of our abilities,\u201d\nY/N smirked. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not try and start a war alright?\u201d</p><p>Y/N nodded, her smirk widening. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><i><b>To be continued\u2026.</b></i></p><p><a href=\"http://crystal-siren.tumblr.com/post/175569954732/knowledge-dadtony-x-reader-loki-x-reader-pt\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Part 4</b></a><br></p>",

She did not answer right away, her eyes fixated on the partially\nfrozen surface below. When she spoke, however, her voice was soft, like a\nbreath of wind. &ldquo;I love him.&rdquo;</p><p>Silence answered her statement. Not waiting for her cousin\nto respond, Y/N dropped the heavy coat she wore and shivered as the icy\nSiberian air hit her skin. The last thing she heard was her cousin&rsquo;s protests\nbefore the cold water surrounded her. </p><p>~ ~ ~ </p><p><i>&ldquo;Look, the sky is so beautiful tonight.&rdquo; Her eyes shone like\nthe stars above them.</i></p><p><i>Indeed it was, a calm quiet spring night with not even the\nslightest breeze to disturb them. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It is times like these that make me believe we are the only\ntwo people in existence.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>He soon found himself agreeing with her.

She often visited him in that\nmanner. Dreams, nightmares and visions. His escape from the isolation that was\nhis punishment. The books his mother brought soon bored him and sight of the\nsame four walls was slowly driving him mad. </p><p>The memory of her voice floated around the cell and he\nclosed his eyes in an effort to escape back to where she was. He had no such\nluck. Sighing in frustration, he bent to retrieve a discarded book when a\nsudden coldness engulfed him. A bone-chilling cold that seemed to pulse\never-so-slightly. He had never felt anything like it. </p><p>Looking at his hands, he noticed that they had not shifted\nto the blue of his natural Jotun form. Confused, he cast a reflection spell but\ndid not see himself.</p><p><i>Distorted sun rays soon made it clear that what he was\nlooking at was underwater. A figure soon came into view and Loki did not have\nto guess who that was. Her coloured hair hung suspended in the water as she\nswam. She seemed to be swimming upwards. Her hands reached the surface first.\nBut they did not pass through the water as expected. The surface was hard and\nwould not yield even when she slammed her fists against it. </i></p><p><i>It was then that the prince saw fear enter her beautiful\neyes. Her lips were clamped shut in order to preserve the precious air she had\nleft. She began to claw at the ice, her actions becoming weaker as more time\npassed. </i></p><p><i>~ ~ ~ </i></p><p>Y/N was beginning to panic<i>, </i>no matter how hard she\nhit or clawed, the ice would not give way. Surely her cousin would be hearing\nthis? Y/N was tempted to call out to him with what strength and air she had\nleft. </p><p>Her lungs were burning. The need for oxygen was becoming\nparamount. Her desperate eyes searched her surroundings and soon locked onto\nthe submerged leg of the pier. Swimming up to it, she began to claw at the ice\nsurrounding it. Still to no avail. Seeing no other options, she opened her\nmouth and screamed as best as one could underwater. &ldquo;NIKOLAS!&rdquo; A rush of\nbubbles accompanied the word. </p><p>When no immediate response came, her panic increased. Y/N\nrefused to give up. She had made a promise and she&rsquo;d be damned before letting\nanything make her break it. Her bruised and bloodied hands pounded on the ice\nand with fast dwindling reserves of air, she continued to call for her cousin. </p><p>~ ~ ~ </p><p>Loki hated it. Watching her trapped under ice and fighting\nto survive. He loathed how helpless he felt. Unable to help her in anyway.\nForced to stand and watch while the woman he loved could very well be living\nher last moments. </p><p>The cold had not left him. If anything, it had gotten worse.\nHe heard the fear and panic in her voice as she called for someone named\nNikolas. In any other situation, Loki would have been jealous. But now, he\nsimply prayed and begged that this person would hear her. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;if you can hear me, I beg you not give\nup. I beg you to keep fighting. I beg you to live.&rdquo; </p><p>~ ~ ~ </p><p>She thought she was hearing things. The lack of air seemed\nto playing tricks on her oxygen-deprived brain. The voice, <i>his</i> voice,\nseemed to come from everywhere. It surrounded her with a comforting warmth and\nclosing her eyes, she saw two emerald-eyes look back at her. Pleading with her\nto keep going. </p><p><i>Open your eyes, </i>they\nseemed to say<i>, open them. Stay awake! Keep fighting. Don&rsquo;t you dare give up.\nWake up and keep going.</i></p><p>~ ~ ~ </p><p>Loki watched in frozen horror as her eyes remained closed\ndespite his pleas. Her hands, which had been raised to break the ice, now hung\nsuspended in the water. Her lips, a dark shade of purple, were curved in a\ngentle smile. </p><p>The prince watched in agonizing helplessness, his eyes\nscanning her for any signs of life. Even in such a state, he found himself\nmesmerised by her. Even now, he hoped and prayed that her eyes would open, that\nshe would continue to fight like the survivor he knew her to be. </p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Keep fighting woman! Damn you, don&rsquo;t you dare stop.&rdquo;\nA shuddering breath escaped him. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t lose you,&rdquo; he whispered, his voice\nchoked with the tears he was struggling to hold back. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t survive.&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes remained trained on her, they did not leave her,\nnot even when the ice above her was finally broken. Not even when she was\nlifted into the arms of her cousin. Wrapped in thick towels and furs, Y/N was\ncarried away, her beautiful eyes closed to the world. Her elegant form limp in\nher cousin&rsquo;s arms. </p><p>&ldquo;May we meet again, my love,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;I promise you,\nthat my soul will find no rest until it has found yours.&rdquo;</p><p>Braving one last look at the reflection, he saw only\nhimself, and the Queen who stood silently behind him.</p><p>If his mother&rsquo;s presence startled him, Loki refused to show\nit. Pushing himself off the bed, he stood and faced the older woman. </p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; The words came out harsher than\nhe intended.</p><p>&ldquo;Is a mother not permitted to see her son?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You are not my mo-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am not your birth mother,&rdquo; Frigga cut him off with a sad\nsmile. &ldquo;That I know. You have reminded me many times these past two years. But\nI raised you and loved you, I still love you. That makes me as much your mother\nas the one that gave birth to you.&rdquo;</p><p>Loki could not find the right words to say to such a\nstatement. Turning away from her, he fought against the tears that came every\ntime she spoke that way. </p><p>&ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; Frigga asked in a soft voice. </p><p>Loki knew full well who she was talking about. He briefly\nconsidered lying even though he knew that Frigga would easily see through him.\n&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The young woman in the reflection.&rdquo;</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Loki turned to face her. &ldquo;She was a\nmortal I became acquainted with during my time on Midgard.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A mortal you say?&rdquo; Frigga was intrigued, to say the least.\nWhat was it about this young woman in particular that had snagged the attention\nof her younger son?&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>Frigga nodded thoughtfully, her eyes never leaving him. &ldquo;A\nvery headstrong young woman, to be sure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How would you know such a thing?&rdquo; Loki narrowed his eyes at\nthe Queen and kept his tone neutral. </p><p>&ldquo;I do believe your brother spoke of her. A mortal woman with\nhair and eyes unlike any he has seen before. Of such a vivid colour that it\nwould be impossible to lose her within a crowd of thousands.&rdquo; Frigga smiled in\nmemory of Thor&rsquo;s description of the young lady. &ldquo;A mortal who valued knowledge\nabove all else.&rdquo;</p><p>The image of Y/N clutching her book to her chest came\nunbidden to the forefront of Loki&rsquo;s memory. Her Y/F/C hair was tousled from\nsleep but her eyes were bright with curiosity. </p><p><i>&ldquo;You like to read?&rdquo;</i> He heard\nhimself ask. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes. I do.&rdquo;</i> She\nanswered, <i>&ldquo;if you ask my parents, they would say I spend more time reading\nthan in the company of actual people.&rdquo; </i></p><p>Frigga watched her son closely. His eyes seemed to be seeing\nsomething else, something far away. A sad smile graced his features. In that\nmoment, the prince seemed to forget he had company and dropped the masks of\narrogance and indifference.</p><p>Frigga decided that perhaps it was best that she left\nwithout telling him. If memories offered him a respite from the isolation and\nloneliness, who was she to take that away from him ?</p><p>~ ~ ~ </p><p>The first thing Y/N noticed upon opening her eyes was how\nwarm it was. Her e/c eyes were immediately drawn to a large fireplace. </p><p>&ldquo;Welcome back to the land of the living.&rdquo; Her cousin knelt\nby the fire and smirked at her from over his shoulder. &ldquo;I hate to say it but, I\ndid say this was going to happen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t sound like you hate to say it,&rdquo; Y/N shot back, her\nvoice a little hoarse. Her eyes sparkled with mischief despite her weakened\nstate. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh no you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Nikolas left the fire and came to sit on\nthe bed beside her. &ldquo;You almost drowned in a partially frozen lake, you&rsquo;re not\ngoing anywhere.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t even say anything,&rdquo; she protested and grinned. </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo; Nikolas tried and failed to look\nserious.

The one\nthat attacked New York two years ago?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N nodded, her smile fading a little. &ldquo;To be fair, my dear\ncousin, he never actually went through with it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m sorry, the one that <i>tried</i> to attack New\nYork.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you don&rsquo;t like the answer, but you quite\nliterally asked for it,&rdquo; Y/N reminded him. </p><p>Nikolas said nothing, he simply shook his head and turned\nhis attention back to the crackling flames in the fireplace. </p><p>&ldquo;I need your help.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My help?&rdquo; Nikolas spoke, remaining in the same position.\n&ldquo;What could you possibly need my help for?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Getting the stone back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He stood up and faced her, &ldquo;absolutely not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just being petty now,&rdquo; Y/N grinned up at her\nstone-faced cousin. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an intelligence agent, this is quite literally what\nyou do.&rdquo;</p><p>Nikolas stared at her as though she had grown a third eye.\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a spy, yes, but not a thief.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry dear cousin,&rdquo; Y/N met his eyes, &ldquo;but I do not see\nthe difference.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You seem to be forgetting a very important aspect of all of\nthis.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N raised her eyebrows and gestured for him to continue.\n&ldquo;And that would be?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>Russian</i> intelligence and you want me to steal\nsomething from an <i>American </i>intelligence organisation. How does that not\nspell <i>trouble</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N crossed her arms over her chest. &ldquo;Since when have you\nevery backed down in the face of a challenge?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a challenge Y/N,&rdquo; Nikolas tried to reason with\nher. &ldquo;If anything goes wrong, America will blame Russia and we&rsquo;ll have Cold War\n2.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh please,&rdquo; Y/N rolled her eyes, &ldquo;there is no need to be so\ndramatic. This is hardly a war declaration. You&rsquo;re simply helping me get back\nsomething that was stolen from me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you never had it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Technicalities,&rdquo; Y/N dismissed with a small wave, &ldquo;the\npoint is, they took it because they knew I was looking for it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you have any idea what you sound like?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Like a mad genius?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You got the mad part right,&rdquo; Nickolas shook his head and\nran a hand through his hair. </p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Y/N&rsquo;s eyes sparkled, &ldquo;are you in?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, did you not hear a word of what I just said?&rdquo;</p><p>She nodded and grinned, &ldquo;sure I did.&rdquo;</p><p>Nikolas soon found himself returning the expression and\nsmiled down at her. &ldquo;This plan of yours will most likely get us caught or\nkilled.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good to know you&rsquo;re so confident in both of our abilities,&rdquo;\nY/N smirked. </p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not try and start a war alright?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N nodded, her smirk widening. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><i><b>To be continued&hellip;.</b></i></p><p><a href=\"http://crystal-siren.tumblr.com/post/175569954732/knowledge-dadtony-x-reader-loki-x-reader-pt\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Part 4</b></a><br /></p>",
