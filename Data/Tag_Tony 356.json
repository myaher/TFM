Clint convinces them that a woman named Blair might be a lead. Without telling them who she really is, Clint convinces Tony to let him watch her. Making old memories pop up for Clint. </i></p><p><b><i>Warnings: </i></b> <b>SMUT</b> (unprotected), Language </p><p><i><b>A/N:</b></i> So my prompt was \u201cwho is she?\u201d for the Marvel Writing Challenge started by <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mi4oYYhr5oDgNDkDw-37KtQ\">@cleolemonfanfiction</a> Hopefully this isn\u2019t too bad. Also this takes place as if Clint was involved in Infinity War. This is my first smut too guys. </p><p>\u2022</p><p><b>{Clint\u2019s POV}</b></p><p>As I\u2019m standing outside the white-picket-fenced house, watching the woman with blonde hair my earpiece turns on. </p><p>\u201cDo you really think this is wise, Clint?\u201d I can hear Tony say, \u201cWe don\u2019t even know this girl. There\u2019s just no evidence of her having any connection to Thanos. Maybe you should head back. We shouldn\u2019t have kept this from the team anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Tony,\u201d I reply, \u201cI just.. I need this right now. Okay? Maybe she does have a connection you just need to let me see.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIs this personal, Barton? We\u2019re trying to find Thanos not reconnect your past hookups.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Tony.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, Barton, you will get your ass back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo I won\u2019t.\u201d I say back and start fiddling with my earpiece. </p><p>\u201cTell me one reason why I shouldn\u2019t come and get you. Who is she, Barton?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d </p><p><b><i>4 Years Ago</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019ll be there when I get there, don\u2019t worry about it, okay?\u201d I say angrily to my phone and quickly hang up before I hear a response. </i></p><p><i>The girl in front of me is ordering a cofee that sounds like she\u2019s making her own from the others on the menu. I look at my watch and roll my eyes. </i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd the name?\u201d The guy at the counter asks. </i></p><p><i>\u201cBlair.\u201d She responds. Checking for her wallet. I can tell she\u2019s getting nervous. She probably feels bad for holding up an entire line</i>. </p><p><i>\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry I swear I have my wallet in here, ya know, some-somewhere.\u201d She\u2019s stuttering now, I take out a twenty and put it on the counter. </i></p><p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I got it.\u201d She smiles and takes a few steps to the side while she gets her coffee. I order an Americano and walk away</i>. </p><p><i>\u201cHey! Um-you!\u201d I hear someone shout. I turn around and the girl from the coffee shop is running towards me. When she catches up I can finally see her appearance, she has big, green eyes, with long, blonde hair. She hands me a twenty. </i></p><p><i>\u201cLike I said, I had my wallet. But thank you for getting that.\u201d She says, shyly</i>.  </p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s no problem, keep it.\u201d She puts it in my coat pocket anyway. </i></p><p><i>\u201cNope, this way, I don\u2019t feel like that was charity, or something.\u201d </i></p><p><i>I laugh a little, \u201cAlright then,\u201d and start to walk away again. She starts walking with me and I give her a weird look. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI just, ya know, really wanted to pay you back because I\u2019m not like someone who accepts stuff like that,\u201d She says this all very awkwardly, and I don\u2019t know how to react. </i></p><p>\u201cLook, don\u2019t worry, okay? It\u2019s just a simple thing.\u201d </p><p><i>\u201cOh, yeah, okay. Um, Blair-I mean my name is Blair and I\u2019m not usually this awkward you\u2019re just\u2026 so um, anyway,\u201d I read her lips more than I hear the awkward sentence structure. She\u2019s stuttering over her words and blushing. </i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I laugh at her awkwardness. \u201cI\u2019m Clint. It\u2019s nice to meet you, Blair.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>Present</b></i></p><p>The sound of a car driving up sends me back in to present and promptly ends my thoughts. Blair is gripping her sink with her head down. There\u2019s a glass next to her and she keeps looking at it like she\u2019s imagining it filling up. </p><p>\u201cBarton, now,\u201d Tony had came up behind me and was now trying to get me to leave, \u201cWe need to go. This was never supposed to be personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, whatever,\u201d I get up and walk with him to the car. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll keep this between us, Clint,\u201d Tony starts his lecture. \u201cBut you\u2019re not to see that girl again. Get your head in the damn game. Thanos is the problem. Not some random girl you hooked up with and are feeling the need to stalk.\u201d </p><p>I tune him out hearing his rant in the background as I look up at the sky and slowly drift off to sleep. </p><p><b><i>3 years ago </i></b></p><p><i>\u201cClint hurry! It\u2019s pouring!\u201d Blair says to me and laughs.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s the point it\u2019s fun!\u201d I say back, and pull her in to our apartment. She\u2019s laughing at me and stands up on her toes and kisses me. I wrap my arms around her waist and kiss back. She jumps up and wraps her legs around my waist. </i></p><p><i>\u201cLike you said, it\u2019s fun.\u201d She winks at me and kisses me again. She\u2019s running her fingers through my hair while her other hand runs down my back. </i></p><p><i>I quickly get us in to the bedroom and softly drop her down on to the bed, climbing on top of her with my arms on either sides of her. She starts pulling my shirt off. I take the hint and sit up to pull it off doing the same to her. </i></p><p><i>I kiss from her lips, down her jawline,to the middle of her chest, she moans and starts grinding her hips against me. I sit her up and she bites my earlobe as I unclip her bra and slip my hand down her pants. </i></p><p><i>She gasps at the sudden contact and moans as I start rubbing circles on her clit. And my jeans become tighter. She kisses me desperately. </i></p><p><i>\u201cClint, baby, please,\u201d she\u2019s practically begging for it. The tone in her voice is seductive yet innocent. </i></p><p><i>\u201cTell me what you want, princess,\u201d I say as I kiss her jawline and slowly insert a finger inside her pumping in and out slowly. She moans loudly and I feel her start to get more wet than she already was. I push a second finger inside her and push them in faster and harder. </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou, Clint, I want you,\u201d she\u2019s scratching up my arms and back and I kiss her roughly. I pull her pants off quickly, with her panties along with them. I do the same to my pants and boxers and dick springs free. I start lining myself up to her and look down. </i></p><p><i>\u201cAre you sure, Blair?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cYes, now please. I need you inside me, Clint.\u201d And with that I push myself inside of her. She winces and gasps. I wait for her to give me some kind of signal to move, to show she\u2019s adjusted to me. She lets out her breath and opens her eyes I start moving slowly. She\u2019s moaning and her chest is bouncing right along with my thrusts. </i></p><p><i>\u201cFaster, please,\u201d she wraps her legs around my waist and pulls me closer. I thrust into her faster and she scratches my back. And starts screaming my name. She lifts her hips off the bed and she grips the sheets. </i></p><p><i>\u201cClint I\u2019m going to..\u201d She starts clenching around me and her legs start shaking. </i></p><p><i>\u201cCum for me baby,\u201d I say. She screams my name one last time before she grips me tightly. I keep thrusting into her a few more times and pull out just in time to finish on my hand. I clean up the mess and she grabs one of my shirts. </i></p><p><i>\u201cCome here,\u201d I say, and she falls asleep in my arms. </i></p><p><b><i>Present</i></b></p><p>I wake up to muffled talking outside my room. I grumble and roll over, checking the time. It\u2019s almost 10 a.m. I get up and hurriedly put on a T-shirt and jeans, opening the door to see Tony outside my room. </p><p>\u201cMove,\u201d I say and bump him with my shoulder to walk by. </p><p>\u201cWe should talk about what happened last night, Barton.\u201d I ignore him. He walks past me in to the main room of headquarters where they\u2019re talking about Thanos. </p><p>\u201cHe already has three of the stones, we need to stop him before he gets a fourth.\u201d Steve is saying. This is all they\u2019ve been talking about, which I know is important, but it\u2019s annoying. I grab keys and walk out. </p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?!\u201d Steve shouts</p><p>\u201cOut!\u201d I yell back</p><p><b><i>2 years ago</i></b></p><p><i>I wake up when I feel weight on top of my body and the sun shining obnoxiously through the blinds. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWake up, Sleepyhead,\u201d I slowly open my eyes, grimacing at the annoying light. I see beautiful, green eyes, looking at me through long blonde hair, straddling me and her sweater dropping off her shoulder. </i></p><p><i>\u201cNo, it\u2019s too early. Let me sleep, Blair.\u201d I smile and try to roll over but she\u2019s enjoying this too much to let me, and she pins my arms to the bed. </i></p><p><i>\u201cUh-uh Clint, I think you owe me a lot of attention.\u201d I look up at her and groan. </i></p><p><i>\u201cNow do I?\u201d I overpower her and flip us over and kiss her and she laughs. </i></p><p><i>\u201cYes, you do,\u201d kissing her back and laying back down on the bed. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWe should do something today,\u201d she says. </i></p><p><i>\u201cLike what?\u201d I rub my face, slowly waking up. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t know, something. Go see a movie and go out to dinner, maybe. Please.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cAlright, we will. I\u2019ll take you shopping too.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cYay! Thank you!\u201d She says and kisses me again and cuddles up against my side. The things I do for this girl. </i></p><p><b><i>Present</i></b></p><p>I pull up to Blair\u2019s house. She\u2019s in her kitchen again. Talking to someone on the phone. Before I know it I\u2019m walking up to the door and standing on the doorstep trying to get the courage to knock. </p><p><b><i>1 year ago</i></b></p><p><i>I pull up to our apartment at about 12 a.m. I told Blair not to wait up for me. But the lights are on, indicating she did anyway. I walk up and unlock our door. She\u2019s eating a big bowl of popcorn, and watching a movie. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat are you still doing up?\u201d I ask her </i></p><p><i>\u201cWhy are you out so late?\u201d She remarks back. </i></p><p><b><i>Present</i></b></p><p>I knock on the door and I hear footsteps and she opens it. She obviously looks just the same. Maybe happier but it\u2019s still my Blair. </p><p>\u201cClint? What-What are you doing here?\u201d She asks, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in a while,\u201d she leans against the doorway. </p><p>\u201cYeah it\u2019s been a year,\u201d I say and look down. </p><p><i><b>1 year ago</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m getting tired of this Clint. This is what you\u2019ve been doing for the past fucking month. What\u2019s going on with you?\u201d She asks, irritated. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m just working late, Blair. You know that.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah okay, what about leaving in the middle of the night, for work? Or not coming home until the next day?\u201d She asks again. I can\u2019t tell her what\u2019s been going on, about the team. It\u2019s to keep her safe. </i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s just work. It\u2019s nothing.\u201d I say back and she\u2019s getting even more mad now. </i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah, okay. You\u2019re such a liar. I can tell you\u2019re lying to me. Either tell me the truth or get out.\u201d She lays down an ultimatum and my heart drops. I get frustrated, and stay quiet. But I shouldn\u2019t be. I am lying. </i></p><p><i>\u201cGet out, now.\u201d </i></p><p><i><b>Present</b></i> </p><p>\u201cReally? It\u2019s been that long? Wow.\u201d She says. </p><p>\u201cI just ya know, wanted to check on you.I was just driving by..\u201d I rub the back of my neck. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d she says, \u201cWhat about you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d there\u2019s an awkward silence for a second. \u201cWould you like to go out sometime?\u201d </p><p>\u201cClint, I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cI just want to be able to explain everything?\u201d I say.  </p><p>\u201cAfter a year, you finally want to explain?\u201d She says sarcastically. \u201cFine,\u201d she sighs. \u201cTonight 7:30.

She jumps up and wraps her legs around my waist. </i></p><p><i>\u201cLike you said, it\u2019s fun.\u201d She winks at me and kisses me again. She\u2019s running her fingers through my hair while her other hand runs down my back. </i></p><p><i>I quickly get us in to the bedroom and softly drop her down on to the bed, climbing on top of her with my arms on either sides of her. She starts pulling my shirt off. I take the hint and sit up to pull it off doing the same to her. </i></p><p><i>I kiss from her lips, down her jawline,to the middle of her chest, she moans and starts grinding her hips against me. I sit her up and she bites my earlobe as I unclip her bra and slip my hand down her pants. </i></p><p><i>She gasps at the sudden contact and moans as I start rubbing circles on her clit. And my jeans become tighter. She kisses me desperately. </i></p><p><i>\u201cClint, baby, please,\u201d she\u2019s practically begging for it. The tone in her voice is seductive yet innocent. </i></p><p><i>\u201cTell me what you want, princess,\u201d I say as I kiss her jawline and slowly insert a finger inside her pumping in and out slowly. She moans loudly and I feel her start to get more wet than she already was. I push a second finger inside her and push them in faster and harder. </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou, Clint, I want you,\u201d she\u2019s scratching up my arms and back and I kiss her roughly. I pull her pants off quickly, with her panties along with them. I do the same to my pants and boxers and dick springs free. I start lining myself up to her and look down. </i></p><p><i>\u201cAre you sure, Blair?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cYes, now please. I need you inside me, Clint.\u201d And with that I push myself inside of her. She winces and gasps. I wait for her to give me some kind of signal to move, to show she\u2019s adjusted to me. She lets out her breath and opens her eyes I start moving slowly. She\u2019s moaning and her chest is bouncing right along with my thrusts. </i></p><p><i>\u201cFaster, please,\u201d she wraps her legs around my waist and pulls me closer. I thrust into her faster and she scratches my back. And starts screaming my name. She lifts her hips off the bed and she grips the sheets. </i></p><p><i>\u201cClint I\u2019m going to..\u201d She starts clenching around me and her legs start shaking. </i></p><p><i>\u201cCum for me baby,\u201d I say. She screams my name one last time before she grips me tightly. I keep thrusting into her a few more times and pull out just in time to finish on my hand. I clean up the mess and she grabs one of my shirts. </i></p><p><i>\u201cCome here,\u201d I say, and she falls asleep in my arms. </i></p><p><b><i>Present</i></b></p><p>I wake up to muffled talking outside my room. I grumble and roll over, checking the time. It\u2019s almost 10 a.m. I get up and hurriedly put on a T-shirt and jeans, opening the door to see Tony outside my room. </p><p>\u201cMove,\u201d I say and bump him with my shoulder to walk by. </p><p>\u201cWe should talk about what happened last night, Barton.\u201d I ignore him. He walks past me in to the main room of headquarters where they\u2019re talking about Thanos. </p><p>\u201cHe already has three of the stones, we need to stop him before he gets a fourth.\u201d Steve is saying. This is all they\u2019ve been talking about, which I know is important, but it\u2019s annoying. I grab keys and walk out. </p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?!\u201d Steve shouts</p><p>\u201cOut!\u201d I yell back</p><p><b><i>2 years ago</i></b></p><p><i>I wake up when I feel weight on top of my body and the sun shining obnoxiously through the blinds. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWake up, Sleepyhead,\u201d I slowly open my eyes, grimacing at the annoying light. I see beautiful, green eyes, looking at me through long blonde hair, straddling me and her sweater dropping off her shoulder. </i></p><p><i>\u201cNo, it\u2019s too early. Let me sleep, Blair.\u201d I smile and try to roll over but she\u2019s enjoying this too much to let me, and she pins my arms to the bed. </i></p><p><i>\u201cUh-uh Clint, I think you owe me a lot of attention.\u201d I look up at her and groan. </i></p><p><i>\u201cNow do I?\u201d I overpower her and flip us over and kiss her and she laughs. </i></p><p><i>\u201cYes, you do,\u201d kissing her back and laying back down on the bed. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWe should do something today,\u201d she says. </i></p><p><i>\u201cLike what?\u201d I rub my face, slowly waking up. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t know, something. Go see a movie and go out to dinner, maybe. Please.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cAlright, we will. I\u2019ll take you shopping too.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cYay! Thank you!\u201d She says and kisses me again and cuddles up against my side. The things I do for this girl. </i></p><p><b><i>Present</i></b></p><p>I pull up to Blair\u2019s house. She\u2019s in her kitchen again. Talking to someone on the phone. Before I know it I\u2019m walking up to the door and standing on the doorstep trying to get the courage to knock. </p><p><b><i>1 year ago</i></b></p><p><i>I pull up to our apartment at about 12 a.m. I told Blair not to wait up for me. But the lights are on, indicating she did anyway. I walk up and unlock our door. She\u2019s eating a big bowl of popcorn, and watching a movie. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat are you still doing up?\u201d I ask her </i></p><p><i>\u201cWhy are you out so late?\u201d She remarks back. </i></p><p><b><i>Present</i></b></p><p>I knock on the door and I hear footsteps and she opens it. She obviously looks just the same. Maybe happier but it\u2019s still my Blair. </p><p>\u201cClint? What-What are you doing here?\u201d She asks, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in a while,\u201d she leans against the doorway. </p><p>\u201cYeah it\u2019s been a year,\u201d I say and look down. </p><p><i><b>1 year ago</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m getting tired of this Clint. This is what you\u2019ve been doing for the past fucking month. What\u2019s going on with you?\u201d She asks, irritated. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m just working late, Blair. You know that.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah okay, what about leaving in the middle of the night, for work? Or not coming home until the next day?\u201d She asks again. I can\u2019t tell her what\u2019s been going on, about the team. It\u2019s to keep her safe. </i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s just work. It\u2019s nothing.\u201d I say back and she\u2019s getting even more mad now. </i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah, okay. You\u2019re such a liar. I can tell you\u2019re lying to me. Either tell me the truth or get out.\u201d She lays down an ultimatum and my heart drops. I get frustrated, and stay quiet. But I shouldn\u2019t be. I am lying. </i></p><p><i>\u201cGet out, now.\u201d </i></p><p><i><b>Present</b></i> </p><p>\u201cReally? It\u2019s been that long? Wow.\u201d She says. </p><p>\u201cI just ya know, wanted to check on you.I was just driving by..\u201d I rub the back of my neck. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d she says, \u201cWhat about you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d there\u2019s an awkward silence for a second. \u201cWould you like to go out sometime?\u201d </p><p>\u201cClint, I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cI just want to be able to explain everything?\u201d I say.  </p><p>\u201cAfter a year, you finally want to explain?\u201d She says sarcastically. \u201cFine,\u201d she sighs. \u201cTonight 7:30.

Also this takes place as if Clint was involved in Infinity War. This is my first smut too guys. </p><p>&bull;</p><p><b>{Clint&rsquo;s POV}</b></p><p>As I&rsquo;m standing outside the white-picket-fenced house, watching the woman with blonde hair my earpiece turns on. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you really think this is wise, Clint?&rdquo; I can hear Tony say, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t even know this girl. There&rsquo;s just no evidence of her having any connection to Thanos. Maybe you should head back. We shouldn&rsquo;t have kept this from the team anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, Tony,&rdquo; I reply, &ldquo;I just.. I need this right now. Okay? Maybe she does have a connection you just need to let me see.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Is this personal, Barton? We&rsquo;re trying to find Thanos not reconnect your past hookups.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up, Tony.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No, Barton, you will get your ass back here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; I say back and start fiddling with my earpiece. </p><p>&ldquo;Tell me one reason why I shouldn&rsquo;t come and get you. Who is she, Barton?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it.&rdquo; </p><p><b><i>4 Years Ago</i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there when I get there, don&rsquo;t worry about it, okay?&rdquo; I say angrily to my phone and quickly hang up before I hear a response. </i></p><p><i>The girl in front of me is ordering a cofee that sounds like she&rsquo;s making her own from the others on the menu. I look at my watch and roll my eyes. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;And the name?&rdquo; The guy at the counter asks. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Blair.&rdquo; She responds. Checking for her wallet. I can tell she&rsquo;s getting nervous. She probably feels bad for holding up an entire line</i>. </p><p><i>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m sorry I swear I have my wallet in here, ya know, some-somewhere.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s stuttering now, I take out a twenty and put it on the counter. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I got it.&rdquo; She smiles and takes a few steps to the side while she gets her coffee. I order an Americano and walk away</i>. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Hey! Um-you!&rdquo; I hear someone shout. I turn around and the girl from the coffee shop is running towards me. When she catches up I can finally see her appearance, she has big, green eyes, with long, blonde hair. She hands me a twenty. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Like I said, I had my wallet. But thank you for getting that.&rdquo; She says, shyly</i>.  </p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no problem, keep it.&rdquo; She puts it in my coat pocket anyway. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Nope, this way, I don&rsquo;t feel like that was charity, or something.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>I laugh a little, &ldquo;Alright then,&rdquo; and start to walk away again. She starts walking with me and I give her a weird look. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I just, ya know, really wanted to pay you back because I&rsquo;m not like someone who accepts stuff like that,&rdquo; She says this all very awkwardly, and I don&rsquo;t know how to react. </i></p><p>&ldquo;Look, don&rsquo;t worry, okay? It&rsquo;s just a simple thing.&rdquo; </p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh, yeah, okay. Um, Blair-I mean my name is Blair and I&rsquo;m not usually this awkward you&rsquo;re just&hellip; so um, anyway,&rdquo; I read her lips more than I hear the awkward sentence structure.

It&rsquo;s nice to meet you, Blair.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><b>Present</b></i></p><p>The sound of a car driving up sends me back in to present and promptly ends my thoughts. Blair is gripping her sink with her head down. There&rsquo;s a glass next to her and she keeps looking at it like she&rsquo;s imagining it filling up. </p><p>&ldquo;Barton, now,&rdquo; Tony had came up behind me and was now trying to get me to leave, &ldquo;We need to go. This was never supposed to be personal.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, whatever,&rdquo; I get up and walk with him to the car. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll keep this between us, Clint,&rdquo; Tony starts his lecture. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not to see that girl again. Get your head in the damn game. Thanos is the problem. Not some random girl you hooked up with and are feeling the need to stalk.&rdquo; </p><p>I tune him out hearing his rant in the background as I look up at the sky and slowly drift off to sleep. </p><p><b><i>3 years ago </i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;Clint hurry!

I have a plot bunny. Buckle up kiddies because we&rsquo;re going in.\u00a0</p><hr><!-- more --><p>Tony Stark, is a valuable asset to the future of SHIELD, and as such, is protected. So when Tony goes off to MIT at the ripe age of 15, (go with it for this AU) he himself needs a handler. So, they assign young 18 year old Clint Barton to the case, who&rsquo;s ready to prove himself, he&rsquo;s got this. </p><p>Five kidnapping attempts, two birthdays, and a graduation later, Tony Stark is 17, and still the fluffy little nerd that Clint&rsquo;s grown attached to. Queue freak out. Because he&rsquo;s not supposed to get attached, hes only supposed to be there if something goes wrong. Hes certainly not supposed to know how Tony sleeps with the light on after a nightmare, or that he loves to snuggle on the couch and watch Disney movies. </p><p>So he tries distancing himself, which, doesn&rsquo;t do any of them any good because now they&rsquo;re both miserable.
