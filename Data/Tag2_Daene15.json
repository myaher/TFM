        "answer": "<p>The thing about the show\u2019s ending is that it massively distorts the thematics of the entire saga. And now it seems like they are trying to double down on it and make it work. But it doesn\u2019t. What I think D&amp;D may have done, is been influenced to some extent by certain anti theories and thought that they could follow them instead when they were making their massive revisions to the story line. Perhaps they thought that a fan theory must already have been checked and verified for any issues of canon consistency etc. and that they could avoid doing the hard work.</p><p>There is no redeeming Dany\u2019s season 8 arc, of course. All arguments to the conclusion that it made any sense in terms of preceding seasons are rubbish. D&amp;D have found themselves resorting to referring to speeches in season 2 or reactions in season 1. As if we never saw an immense amount of character development between then and now. As if we didn\u2019t even see her saying contrary things about helping and defending innocents back then. As if her subsequent actions were not far more consistent with the compassionate Dany instead of the mad Dany they tried to shoehorn in at the end.</p><p>And yes, Dany does end up being used as an instrument to give the Starks a happy ending. First she occupies Dragonstone and thereby makes it possible for the North to get Dragonglass (you think Jon would have been able to get it from an island so close to King\u2019s Landing if Dany were not the one occupying it? No, Cersei would have blocked him). Her forces and dragons provide major assistance to give humanity, but the Starks first, a plausible force against the Night King. Then she is the one who mops up the long standing Southern threat of Cersei and the Lannisters (i.e. the one that the North had never been strong enough to defeat). Then she conveniently dies after having destroyed King\u2019s Landing as well as the Targaryen reputation and claim. So fully in fact that no one even thinks of whether Jon should have any claim either. And the North never has to lose its independence in any sense since she dies without successor or heir. After which her Unsullied and Dothraki simply leave. As does her dragon. So she came in, solved all the problems faced by the Starks, and they had to pay hardly any price at all other than Sansa being aggravated by their momentary surrender of independence.</p><p>I should point out though, that although it is far clearer in Dany\u2019s case, but in fact Jon ends up being a tool to get the Starks here as well. The last two Targaryens clear away all their problems. Jon is used to bring in a Wildling army to win them back Winterfell, then get all the important stuff from Dany and bring her North, and finally eliminate Dany. After which he gets nothing from them either but has to end up at a place which is basically intended as a prison colony. House Stark has to give nothing up for all these benefits except a year or so of being under Targaryen rule (if we combine both Jon and Dany).\u00a0</p><p>And the great love story of Jonerys (as it was turning out to be before they crapped all over it) gets ruined and thrown under the bus for the Starks as well. Jonerys protects them from any strong action from Dany when Sansa acts towards her in a rude way. It makes Dany desirous of getting accepted by the family and makes her stay her hand in taking any vengeance against them even when she thinks Sansa is betraying her.\u00a0</p><p>Even for House Stark the thematics make no sense. The message seems to be that you should wait for an unexpected outside agent to come in and solve all your problems. I know the Stark stans are trying to say that the message is that you need to be honorable, but know how to play \u201cthe game\u201d as well. However, that message, if intended, is not what is delivered by the show. \u201cThe game\u201d is basically opposed to what is called \u201chonorable\u201d in what we were shown. I see these as absolutely contradictory. It is impossible to be both. All that is possible is to have some balance between where one follows one or the other on a case by case basis. But what is that balance and where does it lie? How is getting such a balance that different from the Lannister position? Even Tywin did not go about doing dishonorable stuff for no reason. He served Aerys quite loyally for many years, for instance. It was just that selfish House interests would trump honor when the two conflicted. But this does not seem too different from Sansa and Arya as we saw them at the end of season 8 (with some xenophobia thrown in the mix as well). The Starks in earlier seasons had a higher claim to being\u00a0\u2018honorable\u2019. But they have changed and apparently discarded the aspects of their characters that made them honorable. Unless we are simply to accept that the Starks are honorable by definition due to the inertia of the earlier seasons, I do not see the show delivers any message about there being a need for both honor and\u00a0 playing\u00a0\u201cthe game.\u201d But all that would mean is that if you want to play the game later in life then you should be very honorable in the early years of your life and then become a cynic later on. As to why you should still continue to be considered honorable after you\u2019ve changed? I have no idea.</p>",

He\u2019s dead. which means that we have no more Dothraki army. So tell me brother what exactly are we doing here?\u201d You ask Aegon as you sit on the edge of the bed in your tent. It had been a while since Daenerys had given birth. Her baby had been born dead and she still had yet to wake up. And Drogo was,well you didn\u2019t really know what he was. His eyes were open but he looked dead. Whatever Daenerys had asked for it didn\u2019t work or atleast not like how she wanted it to be. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you already y/n trust me we still need them. We have to stay here.\u201d He said with a sigh. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting and nothing has happened. We should go back home and start from there.\u201d You told him and he sat next to you. He nodded his head in disagreement. </p><p>\u201cNo we\u2019ll stay here. Please just trust me okay?\u201d He asked as he turned to look at you. You thought about it. It had seemed that there was no reason for you to be here but he kept telling you that you both needed to stay. And you trust your brother more than anyone. But there\u2019s  nothing for you here not anymore. But if he kept insisting then there might be a bigger reason. </p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d You finally said and placed his hand on yours and thanked you with a gentle peck on the side of your head. You heard to what seemed to be Daenerys and Ser Jorahs voice. Aegon and you looked at one another and then walked out. And there she was walking. She looked weaker and there was sadness in her eyes. She was walking In hurry for someone who\u2019s been out for a while. You couldn\u2019t lie that the sight of her alive did get you quite mad you wanted her dead but she also didn\u2019t seem like threat no more. She didn\u2019t have a khalasar or her heir. Drogo was most likely dead. So she wasn\u2019t a big threat no more. Or atleast you hope she wasn\u2019t. </p><p>When Daenerys saw you and Aegon walk out a small smile appeared on her face. </p><p>\u201cYou two stayed?\u201d She asked. </p><p>\u201cYes you\u2019re family we couldn\u2019t leave you not now.\u201d Aegon answered and her smile grew bigger but it didn\u2019t meet her eyes. Her smile died down quickly as she kept walking to where Drogo was. And her smile was replaced with the same frown from before. Once she saw Drogo laying on the floor she ran and kneeled beside him. She murmured something to him and then turned her head to face everyone behind her.</p><p>\u201cWhy is he out here alone?\u201d Daenerys asked as she turned back to Drogo. </p><p>\u201cHe seems to like the warmth Princess.\u201d Ser Jorah said. Or he could tell her the truth he\u2019s dead and it was all because of the witch. </p><p>\u201cHe lives you asked for life you paid for life.\u201d Maegi the witch told Daenerys. </p><p>\u201cThis is not life when will he be as he was?\u201d Daenerys asked. </p><p>\u201cWhen the sun rises in the west, sets in the east when the seas go dry, when the mountains blow in the wind like leaves.\u201d Maegi said as you scoffed. Daenerys turned to glare at Maegi. </p><p>\u201cWe told you not to trust her&hellip;. we should kill her now for what she has done.\u201d You told Daenerys. She looked up at you from she was. She stood quiet but you know she understood. She got up and started walking where you stood. </p><p>\u201cLeave us.\u201d Daenerys said and tried to make her way past you to go to Maegi. Ser Jorah stopped her before she went further. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you alone with the sorceress.\u201d Jorah told her. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right she shouldn\u2019t be alone with her not after what she has done.\u201d Aegon spoke out. </p><p>\u201cI have nothing more the fear from this women.\u201d Daenerys told both men. \u201cGo.\u201d She ordered. Ser Jorah and Aegon hesitated but they left along with you.   </p><p>-</p><p>(Aegon) </p><p>If was dark now. A lot has happened in such a short amount of time. People had died and the khalasar had left leaving them with no army. They were sent here to join Viserys and help him get the iron throne. He\u2019s dead now. And now the army they were going to use were gone too. His sister was getting impatient now. He has given her no further explanation on why they needed to stay but so far he didn\u2019t know either. That was until now. His dream was coming true. At first he was sure it wouldn\u2019t come true and he wanted to leave but he couldn\u2019t find himself willing to do so. It\u2019s like he was being held down to stay. But now as he saw the same pyre from his dream then maybe it was the reason for his need to stay. </p><p>He saw the pyre being built and the rest of his dream came to mind. He could hear his mothers voice in his mind, calling to him. He could hear the chanting from his sister and he saw the eggs. If this was coming true then maybe he needed to follow his dream. He quickly went into his tent and got his egg. He held it and admired it. He looked around for cracks like it appeared in his dream but there was none. He made his way to his sisters tent and she was there reading something in her hand. </p><p>\u201cAegon.\u201d She said to him and he gave her a half smile as he sat down his egg. She seemed to finally see the egg and looked at it and then him with confusion. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d He asked her and she looked down to what seemed to be a letter. </p><p>\u201cJust reading the letter from uncle Oberyn&hellip;.. I miss him and the rest. I miss sunspear.\u201d Her voice cracked with emotion. Her eyes were glossy. Seeing her like this wasn\u2019t common. She didn\u2019t really cry or showed to be upset. Then again there was no need to be that upset when they were in sunspear. She was happy there. She would smile more when she was in sunspear. She was different over there. But now they\u2019re here and she has smiled yes but not as much as before. And she only seemed to be happy with him. So seeing her like this broke his heart a little. He walked over to her and gave her a tight embrace. </p><p>\u201cHey hey hey&hellip;.. I know I miss them too but I promise you that we\u2019ll see uncle Oberyn, Uncle Doran and the rest soon. I know being here right now doesn\u2019t make since but it will.\u201d He pulled away and he cupped her cheeks. He gave her a kiss on her forehead and stroked her cheek wiping the tears that rolled down them. \u201cIt will all make sense now.\u201d He pulled apart from her and walked over to her egg. He tried to remember his dream as best as he could. He then went and got her dagger and went back to the chest with the egg in it. </p><p>\u201cCome over here.\u201d He said and she was hesitant not knowing what her brother was doing but she walked up behind him. </p><p>\u201cAegon what are you doing?\u201d She asked him. And just like that he picked up the chest and wine to put it on the small table. \u201cAegon?\u201d She asked catching his attention this time. </p><p>\u201cYou trust me right?\u201d He asked with the dagger  in his hand. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you only a thousand times that I do. But right now you\u2019re beginning to question myself if I should.\u201d She said the last comment as more of joke. But Aegon didn\u2019t laugh and still seemed to be lost in his own thoughts. </p><p>\u201cOkay I know this is going to sound crazy but I need you listen carefully okay?\u201d He asked as he flipped the dagger so she could grab it. </p><p>\u201cUhmm okay?\u201d She got the dagger from his hand and he turned to back the egg and back to her. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to cut your palm and let the blood  drop onto the egg. And while you\u2019re doing that you\u2019re going to be saying a chant in high Valeryian. Alright?\u201d He explained to her but he was only met by a confused expression. She looked lost as he heard him explain. </p><p>\u201cWhat? Why? What for?\u201d She asked him and he then went around the room getting candles and placed them around the chest only making her more confused. \u201cAegon! What are you doing?!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI had a dream about the pyre and of fire surrounding it. I dreamed that someone was dead. And it came true. Drogo is dead and the pyre is being built. In my dream there was also these eggs and they were cracking.\u201d He explained to her. She furrowed her eyebrows and seemed that she didn\u2019t believe him. \u201cI\u2019ve had this dream multiple times now. Not only once. And it\u2019s coming true that\u2019s why I need you to do this. I saw you doing it my dream.\u201d He told her. </p><p>\u201cUhh I- Aegon it was a dream.\u201d She told him still not believing it. </p><p>\u201cYes but a dream that\u2019s becoming true&hellip;. this is why we needed to stay this is why I asked you to stay and now I need you to trust me to do this.\u201d He pleaded to her. She was quiet for a long time thinking of what to do. \u201cPlease.\u201d He saw her swallow thickly and then she nodded. </p><p>\u201cBut if I die from this cut then I\u2019ll haunt you forever.\u201d He chuckled at her comment. After she has accepted he told her what to say. She cut her palm and let the blood drop onto the her egg while she said the words in high Valyrian just like in his dream. </p><p>After she had finished he wrapped up her cut and they both headed out with both of their dragon eggs in hand. Daenerys and what was rest of the khalasar were already out there. Y/N went to place her dragon egg in the pyre. Aegon thought Daenerys was going to stop them but she didn\u2019t instead she offered them a smile. It\u2019s like she understood what they were doing. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? You\u2019ll need those dragon eggs. Don\u2019t do the same as Daenerys and keep them.\u201d Ser Jorah told them both. </p><p>\u201cWe will.\u201d Aegon told him. Daenerys extended her hands out to Aegon and Y/N telling them to go stand by her and hold them. They were both a little suprised on why she was doing this but they took her hands. </p><p>\u201cYou will be our khalasar. I see the faces of slaves. I free you took off your collars go if you wish no one will stop you but if you stay it will be as brothers and sisters as husband and wives.\u201d Daenerys announced. She paused and saw some people leave but she continued on. \u201cSer Jorah bind this women to the pyre.\u201d He hesitated and she noticed. \u201c you swore to obey me.\u201d After she told him that he did what he was told and tied up Maegi. </p><p>\u201cWe are the Targaryens of the blood of old Valyria! We are the last dragons and we swear to you that those who will harm you will die screaming.\u201d Daenerys continued saying. </p><p>\u201cYou will not hear me scream!\u201d Maegi said from where she was tied up. </p><p>\u201cYou will. They all do.\u201d Y/N said to her. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your screams I want only your life.\u201d Daenerys said. She let go of their hands and then lit the pyre. It lit up just like how Aegon saw in his dreams. It was really becoming true. Daenerys walked in the pyre. Aegon let go of his sisters hand and then held onto his dragon egg with both hands. He started to walk towards the fire. He felt like it was calling to him. Telling him to go in it. Before he could go in he was stopped. </p><p>\u201cAegon? What are you doing? You can\u2019t go in there.\u201d She told him confused. </p><p>\u201cTrust me&hellip;.Ser Jorah don\u2019t let her walk in after me.\u201d He instructed him before he continued walking. He could hear his sister call out to him but he didn\u2019t stop. He continued walking. He thought that the fire would burn him but it didn\u2019t. The fire didn\u2019t burn him. </p><p>- </p><p>(Y/N) </p><p>You fought and fought to be let go but he wouldn\u2019t. You wanted to go after Aegon but Ser Jorah didn\u2019t let you. </p><p>\u201cPlease! Iet me be atleast by him.\u201d You begged him. </p><p>\u201cNo I won\u2019t let you see him burn.\u201d Ser Jorah told her. </p><p>You felt the tears run down your cheeks. You didn\u2019t know about this part of his dream. He never told you he was going to do this. It was a crazy idea and you let him do it. You should\u2019ve stopped him. But you also felt like it was the right thing to do. </p><p>\u201cPlease&hellip;.. I won\u2019t go in I just want to be by him.\u201d You said again. You wiped your tear and stood up straight. \u201cI\u2019m going to go over there and you won\u2019t stop me.\u201d You said to him your voice in a more serious tone. He hestiated but he then moved to the side. You then walked over and stood outside the pyre. You waited and waited. You didn\u2019t know how long or when you had fallen asleep but you did. You woke up to Ser Jorah standing by you. He helped you up and you saw and smelt the smoke and the ash from the burnt pyre. You then hurried over to where you saw two figures sitting on the floor. </p><p>When you saw Aegon he was covered In ash and he was naked. You looked over at daenerys and she looked the same as he did. He lifted his head and you felt relieved that he was alive. But then your eyes went wide when you a little red and black creature go up to his shoulder. You then felt something climb up your leg and and onto your arm. Unlike like his this one was smaller and it was black and blue. You saw their horns and their wings and you couldn\u2019t believe at first but when you heard their screech it was loud. And filled the morning air. </p><p>They hatched. Your dragons had hatched. You had Dragons.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p>",

He\u2019s dead. which means that we have no more Dothraki army. So tell me brother what exactly are we doing here?\u201d You ask Aegon as you sit on the edge of the bed in your tent. It had been a while since Daenerys had given birth. Her baby had been born dead and she still had yet to wake up. And Drogo was,well you didn\u2019t really know what he was. His eyes were open but he looked dead. Whatever Daenerys had asked for it didn\u2019t work or atleast not like how she wanted it to be. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you already y/n trust me we still need them. We have to stay here.\u201d He said with a sigh. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting and nothing has happened. We should go back home and start from there.\u201d You told him and he sat next to you. He nodded his head in disagreement. </p><p>\u201cNo we\u2019ll stay here. Please just trust me okay?\u201d He asked as he turned to look at you. You thought about it. It had seemed that there was no reason for you to be here but he kept telling you that you both needed to stay. And you trust your brother more than anyone. But there\u2019s  nothing for you here not anymore. But if he kept insisting then there might be a bigger reason. </p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d You finally said and placed his hand on yours and thanked you with a gentle peck on the side of your head. You heard to what seemed to be Daenerys and Ser Jorahs voice. Aegon and you looked at one another and then walked out. And there she was walking. She looked weaker and there was sadness in her eyes. She was walking In hurry for someone who\u2019s been out for a while. You couldn\u2019t lie that the sight of her alive did get you quite mad you wanted her dead but she also didn\u2019t seem like threat no more. She didn\u2019t have a khalasar or her heir. Drogo was most likely dead. So she wasn\u2019t a big threat no more. Or atleast you hope she wasn\u2019t. </p><p>When Daenerys saw you and Aegon walk out a small smile appeared on her face. </p><p>\u201cYou two stayed?\u201d She asked. </p><p>\u201cYes you\u2019re family we couldn\u2019t leave you not now.\u201d Aegon answered and her smile grew bigger but it didn\u2019t meet her eyes. Her smile died down quickly as she kept walking to where Drogo was. And her smile was replaced with the same frown from before. Once she saw Drogo laying on the floor she ran and kneeled beside him. She murmured something to him and then turned her head to face everyone behind her.</p><p>\u201cWhy is he out here alone?\u201d Daenerys asked as she turned back to Drogo. </p><p>\u201cHe seems to like the warmth Princess.\u201d Ser Jorah said. Or he could tell her the truth he\u2019s dead and it was all because of the witch. </p><p>\u201cHe lives you asked for life you paid for life.\u201d Maegi the witch told Daenerys. </p><p>\u201cThis is not life when will he be as he was?\u201d Daenerys asked. </p><p>\u201cWhen the sun rises in the west, sets in the east when the seas go dry, when the mountains blow in the wind like leaves.\u201d Maegi said as you scoffed. Daenerys turned to glare at Maegi. </p><p>\u201cWe told you not to trust her\u2026. we should kill her now for what she has done.\u201d You told Daenerys. She looked up at you from she was. She stood quiet but you know she understood. She got up and started walking where you stood. </p><p>\u201cLeave us.\u201d Daenerys said and tried to make her way past you to go to Maegi. Ser Jorah stopped her before she went further. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you alone with the sorceress.\u201d Jorah told her. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right she shouldn\u2019t be alone with her not after what she has done.\u201d Aegon spoke out. </p><p>\u201cI have nothing more the fear from this women.\u201d Daenerys told both men. \u201cGo.\u201d She ordered. Ser Jorah and Aegon hesitated but they left along with you.   </p><p>-</p><p>(Aegon) </p><p>If was dark now. A lot has happened in such a short amount of time. People had died and the khalasar had left leaving them with no army. They were sent here to join Viserys and help him get the iron throne. He\u2019s dead now. And now the army they were going to use were gone too. His sister was getting impatient now. He has given her no further explanation on why they needed to stay but so far he didn\u2019t know either. That was until now. His dream was coming true. At first he was sure it wouldn\u2019t come true and he wanted to leave but he couldn\u2019t find himself willing to do so. It\u2019s like he was being held down to stay. But now as he saw the same pyre from his dream then maybe it was the reason for his need to stay. </p><p>He saw the pyre being built and the rest of his dream came to mind. He could hear his mothers voice in his mind, calling to him. He could hear the chanting from his sister and he saw the eggs. If this was coming true then maybe he needed to follow his dream. He quickly went into his tent and got his egg. He held it and admired it. He looked around for cracks like it appeared in his dream but there was none. He made his way to his sisters tent and she was there reading something in her hand. </p><p>\u201cAegon.\u201d She said to him and he gave her a half smile as he sat down his egg. She seemed to finally see the egg and looked at it and then him with confusion. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d He asked her and she looked down to what seemed to be a letter. </p><p>\u201cJust reading the letter from uncle Oberyn\u2026.. I miss him and the rest. I miss sunspear.\u201d Her voice cracked with emotion. Her eyes were glossy. Seeing her like this wasn\u2019t common. She didn\u2019t really cry or showed to be upset. Then again there was no need to be that upset when they were in sunspear. She was happy there. She would smile more when she was in sunspear. She was different over there. But now they\u2019re here and she has smiled yes but not as much as before. And she only seemed to be happy with him. So seeing her like this broke his heart a little. He walked over to her and gave her a tight embrace. </p><p>\u201cHey hey hey\u2026.. I know I miss them too but I promise you that we\u2019ll see uncle Oberyn, Uncle Doran and the rest soon. I know being here right now doesn\u2019t make since but it will.\u201d He pulled away and he cupped her cheeks. He gave her a kiss on her forehead and stroked her cheek wiping the tears that rolled down them. \u201cIt will all make sense now.\u201d He pulled apart from her and walked over to her egg. He tried to remember his dream as best as he could. He then went and got her dagger and went back to the chest with the egg in it. </p><p>\u201cCome over here.\u201d He said and she was hesitant not knowing what her brother was doing but she walked up behind him. </p><p>\u201cAegon what are you doing?\u201d She asked him. And just like that he picked up the chest and wine to put it on the small table. \u201cAegon?\u201d She asked catching his attention this time. </p><p>\u201cYou trust me right?\u201d He asked with the dagger  in his hand. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you only a thousand times that I do. But right now you\u2019re beginning to question myself if I should.\u201d She said the last comment as more of joke. But Aegon didn\u2019t laugh and still seemed to be lost in his own thoughts. </p><p>\u201cOkay I know this is going to sound crazy but I need you listen carefully okay?\u201d He asked as he flipped the dagger so she could grab it. </p><p>\u201cUhmm okay?\u201d She got the dagger from his hand and he turned to back the egg and back to her. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to cut your palm and let the blood  drop onto the egg. And while you\u2019re doing that you\u2019re going to be saying a chant in high Valeryian. Alright?\u201d He explained to her but he was only met by a confused expression. She looked lost as he heard him explain. </p><p>\u201cWhat? Why? What for?\u201d She asked him and he then went around the room getting candles and placed them around the chest only making her more confused. \u201cAegon! What are you doing?!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI had a dream about the pyre and of fire surrounding it. I dreamed that someone was dead. And it came true. Drogo is dead and the pyre is being built. In my dream there was also these eggs and they were cracking.\u201d He explained to her. She furrowed her eyebrows and seemed that she didn\u2019t believe him. \u201cI\u2019ve had this dream multiple times now. Not only once. And it\u2019s coming true that\u2019s why I need you to do this. I saw you doing it my dream.\u201d He told her. </p><p>\u201cUhh I- Aegon it was a dream.\u201d She told him still not believing it. </p><p>\u201cYes but a dream that\u2019s becoming true\u2026. this is why we needed to stay this is why I asked you to stay and now I need you to trust me to do this.\u201d He pleaded to her. She was quiet for a long time thinking of what to do. \u201cPlease.\u201d He saw her swallow thickly and then she nodded. </p><p>\u201cBut if I die from this cut then I\u2019ll haunt you forever.\u201d He chuckled at her comment. After she has accepted he told her what to say. She cut her palm and let the blood drop onto the her egg while she said the words in high Valyrian just like in his dream. </p><p>After she had finished he wrapped up her cut and they both headed out with both of their dragon eggs in hand. Daenerys and what was rest of the khalasar were already out there. Y/N went to place her dragon egg in the pyre. Aegon thought Daenerys was going to stop them but she didn\u2019t instead she offered them a smile. It\u2019s like she understood what they were doing. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? You\u2019ll need those dragon eggs. Don\u2019t do the same as Daenerys and keep them.\u201d Ser Jorah told them both. </p><p>\u201cWe will.\u201d Aegon told him. Daenerys extended her hands out to Aegon and Y/N telling them to go stand by her and hold them. They were both a little suprised on why she was doing this but they took her hands. </p><p>\u201cYou will be our khalasar. I see the faces of slaves. I free you took off your collars go if you wish no one will stop you but if you stay it will be as brothers and sisters as husband and wives.\u201d Daenerys announced. She paused and saw some people leave but she continued on. \u201cSer Jorah bind this women to the pyre.\u201d He hesitated and she noticed. \u201c you swore to obey me.\u201d After she told him that he did what he was told and tied up Maegi. </p><p>\u201cWe are the Targaryens of the blood of old Valyria! We are the last dragons and we swear to you that those who will harm you will die screaming.\u201d Daenerys continued saying. </p><p>\u201cYou will not hear me scream!\u201d Maegi said from where she was tied up. </p><p>\u201cYou will. They all do.\u201d Y/N said to her. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your screams I want only your life.\u201d Daenerys said. She let go of their hands and then lit the pyre. It lit up just like how Aegon saw in his dreams. It was really becoming true. Daenerys walked in the pyre. Aegon let go of his sisters hand and then held onto his dragon egg with both hands. He started to walk towards the fire. He felt like it was calling to him. Telling him to go in it. Before he could go in he was stopped. </p><p>\u201cAegon? What are you doing? You can\u2019t go in there.\u201d She told him confused. </p><p>\u201cTrust me\u2026.Ser Jorah don\u2019t let her walk in after me.\u201d He instructed him before he continued walking. He could hear his sister call out to him but he didn\u2019t stop. He continued walking. He thought that the fire would burn him but it didn\u2019t. The fire didn\u2019t burn him. </p><p>- </p><p>(Y/N) </p><p>You fought and fought to be let go but he wouldn\u2019t. You wanted to go after Aegon but Ser Jorah didn\u2019t let you. </p><p>\u201cPlease! Iet me be atleast by him.\u201d You begged him. </p><p>\u201cNo I won\u2019t let you see him burn.\u201d Ser Jorah told her. </p><p>You felt the tears run down your cheeks. You didn\u2019t know about this part of his dream. He never told you he was going to do this. It was a crazy idea and you let him do it. You should\u2019ve stopped him.

She murmured something to him and then turned her head to face everyone behind her.</p><p>\u201cWhy is he out here alone?\u201d Daenerys asked as she turned back to Drogo. </p><p>\u201cHe seems to like the warmth Princess.\u201d Ser Jorah said. Or he could tell her the truth he\u2019s dead and it was all because of the witch. </p><p>\u201cHe lives you asked for life you paid for life.\u201d Maegi the witch told Daenerys. </p><p>\u201cThis is not life when will he be as he was?\u201d Daenerys asked. </p><p>\u201cWhen the sun rises in the west, sets in the east when the seas go dry, when the mountains blow in the wind like leaves.\u201d Maegi said as you scoffed. Daenerys turned to glare at Maegi. </p><p>\u201cWe told you not to trust her\u2026. we should kill her now for what she has done.\u201d You told Daenerys. She looked up at you from she was. She stood quiet but you know she understood. She got up and started walking where you stood. </p><p>\u201cLeave us.\u201d Daenerys said and tried to make her way past you to go to Maegi. Ser Jorah stopped her before she went further. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you alone with the sorceress.\u201d Jorah told her. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right she shouldn\u2019t be alone with her not after what she has done.\u201d Aegon spoke out. </p><p>\u201cI have nothing more the fear from this women.\u201d Daenerys told both men. \u201cGo.\u201d She ordered. Ser Jorah and Aegon hesitated but they left along with you.   </p><p>-</p><p>(Aegon) </p><p>If was dark now. A lot has happened in such a short amount of time. People had died and the khalasar had left leaving them with no army. They were sent here to join Viserys and help him get the iron throne. He\u2019s dead now. And now the army they were going to use were gone too. His sister was getting impatient now. He has given her no further explanation on why they needed to stay but so far he didn\u2019t know either. That was until now. His dream was coming true. At first he was sure it wouldn\u2019t come true and he wanted to leave but he couldn\u2019t find himself willing to do so. It\u2019s like he was being held down to stay. But now as he saw the same pyre from his dream then maybe it was the reason for his need to stay. </p><p>He saw the pyre being built and the rest of his dream came to mind. He could hear his mothers voice in his mind, calling to him. He could hear the chanting from his sister and he saw the eggs. If this was coming true then maybe he needed to follow his dream. He quickly went into his tent and got his egg. He held it and admired it. He looked around for cracks like it appeared in his dream but there was none. He made his way to his sisters tent and she was there reading something in her hand. </p><p>\u201cAegon.\u201d She said to him and he gave her a half smile as he sat down his egg. She seemed to finally see the egg and looked at it and then him with confusion. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d He asked her and she looked down to what seemed to be a letter. </p><p>\u201cJust reading the letter from uncle Oberyn\u2026.. I miss him and the rest. I miss sunspear.\u201d Her voice cracked with emotion. Her eyes were glossy. Seeing her like this wasn\u2019t common. She didn\u2019t really cry or showed to be upset. Then again there was no need to be that upset when they were in sunspear. She was happy there. She would smile more when she was in sunspear. She was different over there. But now they\u2019re here and she has smiled yes but not as much as before. And she only seemed to be happy with him. So seeing her like this broke his heart a little. He walked over to her and gave her a tight embrace. </p><p>\u201cHey hey hey\u2026.. I know I miss them too but I promise you that we\u2019ll see uncle Oberyn, Uncle Doran and the rest soon. I know being here right now doesn\u2019t make since but it will.\u201d He pulled away and he cupped her cheeks. He gave her a kiss on her forehead and stroked her cheek wiping the tears that rolled down them. \u201cIt will all make sense now.\u201d He pulled apart from her and walked over to her egg. He tried to remember his dream as best as he could. He then went and got her dagger and went back to the chest with the egg in it. </p><p>\u201cCome over here.\u201d He said and she was hesitant not knowing what her brother was doing but she walked up behind him. </p><p>\u201cAegon what are you doing?\u201d She asked him. And just like that he picked up the chest and wine to put it on the small table. \u201cAegon?\u201d She asked catching his attention this time. </p><p>\u201cYou trust me right?\u201d He asked with the dagger  in his hand. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you only a thousand times that I do. But right now you\u2019re beginning to question myself if I should.\u201d She said the last comment as more of joke. But Aegon didn\u2019t laugh and still seemed to be lost in his own thoughts. </p><p>\u201cOkay I know this is going to sound crazy but I need you listen carefully okay?\u201d He asked as he flipped the dagger so she could grab it. </p><p>\u201cUhmm okay?\u201d She got the dagger from his hand and he turned to back the egg and back to her. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to cut your palm and let the blood  drop onto the egg. And while you\u2019re doing that you\u2019re going to be saying a chant in high Valeryian. Alright?\u201d He explained to her but he was only met by a confused expression. She looked lost as he heard him explain. </p><p>\u201cWhat? Why? What for?\u201d She asked him and he then went around the room getting candles and placed them around the chest only making her more confused. \u201cAegon! What are you doing?!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI had a dream about the pyre and of fire surrounding it. I dreamed that someone was dead. And it came true. Drogo is dead and the pyre is being built. In my dream there was also these eggs and they were cracking.\u201d He explained to her. She furrowed her eyebrows and seemed that she didn\u2019t believe him. \u201cI\u2019ve had this dream multiple times now. Not only once. And it\u2019s coming true that\u2019s why I need you to do this. I saw you doing it my dream.\u201d He told her. </p><p>\u201cUhh I- Aegon it was a dream.\u201d She told him still not believing it. </p><p>\u201cYes but a dream that\u2019s becoming true\u2026. this is why we needed to stay this is why I asked you to stay and now I need you to trust me to do this.\u201d He pleaded to her. She was quiet for a long time thinking of what to do. \u201cPlease.\u201d He saw her swallow thickly and then she nodded. </p><p>\u201cBut if I die from this cut then I\u2019ll haunt you forever.\u201d He chuckled at her comment. After she has accepted he told her what to say. She cut her palm and let the blood drop onto the her egg while she said the words in high Valyrian just like in his dream. </p><p>After she had finished he wrapped up her cut and they both headed out with both of their dragon eggs in hand. Daenerys and what was rest of the khalasar were already out there. Y/N went to place her dragon egg in the pyre. Aegon thought Daenerys was going to stop them but she didn\u2019t instead she offered them a smile. It\u2019s like she understood what they were doing. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? You\u2019ll need those dragon eggs. Don\u2019t do the same as Daenerys and keep them.\u201d Ser Jorah told them both. </p><p>\u201cWe will.\u201d Aegon told him. Daenerys extended her hands out to Aegon and Y/N telling them to go stand by her and hold them. They were both a little suprised on why she was doing this but they took her hands. </p><p>\u201cYou will be our khalasar. I see the faces of slaves. I free you took off your collars go if you wish no one will stop you but if you stay it will be as brothers and sisters as husband and wives.\u201d Daenerys announced. She paused and saw some people leave but she continued on. \u201cSer Jorah bind this women to the pyre.\u201d He hesitated and she noticed. \u201c you swore to obey me.\u201d After she told him that he did what he was told and tied up Maegi. </p><p>\u201cWe are the Targaryens of the blood of old Valyria! We are the last dragons and we swear to you that those who will harm you will die screaming.\u201d Daenerys continued saying. </p><p>\u201cYou will not hear me scream!\u201d Maegi said from where she was tied up. </p><p>\u201cYou will. They all do.\u201d Y/N said to her. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your screams I want only your life.\u201d Daenerys said. She let go of their hands and then lit the pyre. It lit up just like how Aegon saw in his dreams. It was really becoming true. Daenerys walked in the pyre. Aegon let go of his sisters hand and then held onto his dragon egg with both hands. He started to walk towards the fire. He felt like it was calling to him. Telling him to go in it. Before he could go in he was stopped. </p><p>\u201cAegon? What are you doing? You can\u2019t go in there.\u201d She told him confused. </p><p>\u201cTrust me\u2026.Ser Jorah don\u2019t let her walk in after me.\u201d He instructed him before he continued walking. He could hear his sister call out to him but he didn\u2019t stop. He continued walking. He thought that the fire would burn him but it didn\u2019t. The fire didn\u2019t burn him. </p><p>- </p><p>(Y/N) </p><p>You fought and fought to be let go but he wouldn\u2019t. You wanted to go after Aegon but Ser Jorah didn\u2019t let you. </p><p>\u201cPlease! Iet me be atleast by him.\u201d You begged him. </p><p>\u201cNo I won\u2019t let you see him burn.\u201d Ser Jorah told her. </p><p>You felt the tears run down your cheeks. You didn\u2019t know about this part of his dream. He never told you he was going to do this. It was a crazy idea and you let him do it. You should\u2019ve stopped him. But you also felt like it was the right thing to do. </p><p>\u201cPlease\u2026.. I won\u2019t go in I just want to be by him.\u201d You said again. You wiped your tear and stood up straight. \u201cI\u2019m going to go over there and you won\u2019t stop me.\u201d You said to him your voice in a more serious tone. He hestiated but he then moved to the side. You then walked over and stood outside the pyre. You waited and waited. You didn\u2019t know how long or when you had fallen asleep but you did. You woke up to Ser Jorah standing by you. He helped you up and you saw and smelt the smoke and the ash from the burnt pyre. You then hurried over to where you saw two figures sitting on the floor. </p><p>When you saw Aegon he was covered In ash and he was naked. You looked over at daenerys and she looked the same as he did. He lifted his head and you felt relieved that he was alive. But then your eyes went wide when you a little red and black creature go up to his shoulder. You then felt something climb up your leg and and onto your arm. Unlike like his this one was smaller and it was black and blue. You saw their horns and their wings and you couldn\u2019t believe at first but when you heard their screech it was loud. And filled the morning air. </p><p>They hatched. Your dragons had hatched. You had Dragons.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p></p>",

He&rsquo;s dead. which means that we have no more Dothraki army. So tell me brother what exactly are we doing here?&rdquo; You ask Aegon as you sit on the edge of the bed in your tent. It had been a while since Daenerys had given birth. Her baby had been born dead and she still had yet to wake up. And Drogo was,well you didn&rsquo;t really know what he was. His eyes were open but he looked dead. Whatever Daenerys had asked for it didn&rsquo;t work or atleast not like how she wanted it to be. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you already y/n trust me we still need them. We have to stay here.&rdquo; He said with a sigh. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting and nothing has happened. We should go back home and start from there.&rdquo; You told him and he sat next to you. He nodded his head in disagreement. </p><p>&ldquo;No we&rsquo;ll stay here. Please just trust me okay?&rdquo; He asked as he turned to look at you. You thought about it. It had seemed that there was no reason for you to be here but he kept telling you that you both needed to stay. And you trust your brother more than anyone. But there&rsquo;s  nothing for you here not anymore. But if he kept insisting then there might be a bigger reason. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; You finally said and placed his hand on yours and thanked you with a gentle peck on the side of your head. You heard to what seemed to be Daenerys and Ser Jorahs voice. Aegon and you looked at one another and then walked out. And there she was walking. She looked weaker and there was sadness in her eyes. She was walking In hurry for someone who&rsquo;s been out for a while. You couldn&rsquo;t lie that the sight of her alive did get you quite mad you wanted her dead but she also didn&rsquo;t seem like threat no more. She didn&rsquo;t have a khalasar or her heir. Drogo was most likely dead. So she wasn&rsquo;t a big threat no more. Or atleast you hope she wasn&rsquo;t. </p><p>When Daenerys saw you and Aegon walk out a small smile appeared on her face. </p><p>&ldquo;You two stayed?&rdquo; She asked. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes you&rsquo;re family we couldn&rsquo;t leave you not now.&rdquo; Aegon answered and her smile grew bigger but it didn&rsquo;t meet her eyes.
