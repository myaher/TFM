It had rained all last night and you couldn\u2019t\nwait to get out in the yard.</p><p>The fresh after-rain scent of the grass and surrounding\ntrees hit your senses and set your heart racing. Rain in New York City left a\nhint of a fresh scent in the air, but it didn\u2019t have what the compound was\nsurrounded by right now: mud puddles.</p><p>With a squeal and a running start, you launched yourself\ninto the first puddle you saw. The splash flew up around you and you felt like\na little kid again. Puddle stomping had been a tradition for you and your\nsiblings after every rainstorm when you were growing up. It had been so long\nsince you had lived where puddles like this formed and you were going to spend\nthe day enjoying them.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>Bucky followed Natasha off the jet and onto the rooftop\nlanding pad. Exhaustion was seeping from every pore and visions of his bed were\ndancing through his mind. It had been a long mission and he was ready to crash.</p><p>Before he could get inside, a laugh from the yard caught his\nattention. He looked over the edge and saw you splashing in the puddles.</p><p><i>Who is that?</i></p><p>Steve came out to welcome Bucky back and found him watching\nyou. The Captain\u2019s face lit up with a soft smile when he saw you splashing\naround.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019ve spotted Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d Bucky couldn\u2019t take his eyes off you.</p><p>\u201cThe newest member of the team.\u201d Steve clapped Bucky on the\nshoulder. \u201cCome on in and get cleaned up, maybe get a few hours of sleep.\nDinner is at seven. I\u2019ll introduce you then.\u201d</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-\u00a0</p><p>At six thirty you finally forced yourself to go back inside.\nSeveral splashes had worked their way up your pants and into your boots,\nsoaking you with cold, muddy water. You couldn\u2019t care less.</p><p>You used your half-hour before dinner to dry off and change.\nIt was exactly seven when you padded out of the elevator in your leggings and\nfluffy socks, Tony\u2019s MIT hoodie enveloping you in its warmth. He\u2019d probably\nwant it back once he found out you were the one who stole it. Too bad for him;\nit was your new favorite item of clothing.</p><p>Most of the team and two people you hadn\u2019t met were\nshuffling around the kitchen and dining room, determining the contents of\nvarious Chinese takeout containers and distributing them to the correct recipients.\nSince arriving, you had learned that Tuesdays were for takeout and video games.\nIt was your favorite night of the week.</p><p>\u201cY/N, I\u2019ve got some people for you to meet,\u201d Steve called\nwhen he spotted you. He motioned to the two you didn\u2019t recognize. \u201cThis is\nNatasha, and this is Bucky. They just got back from a pretty long mission,\nwhich is why they haven\u2019t met you yet. Guys, this is Y/N, our new resident\ntelekinetic.\u201d</p><p>You smiled at Nat, a bit nervous at meeting the famous Black\nWidow. \u201cNice to meet you both.\u201d You turned to Bucky. \u201cI hope the mission went\nokay?\u201d</p><p>Nat waved her hand. \u201cIt turned out in the end. I think we\u2019re\nboth just glad to be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a telekinetic?\u201d You weren\u2019t sure what the look on\nBucky\u2019s face as he asked meant, but you replied before you could stop yourself.</p><p>\u201cNo, I actually just shapeshift into a huge bat. Travel by\necholocation, eat fruit flies, sleep upside-down \u2013 stuff like that. Not sure\nwhy they thought I should be an Avenger.\u201d</p><p>Clint cracked up and Bruce smiled, handing you a container.\nYou accepted it and peeked inside. God bless Bruce; beef lo mein was your\nfavorite. You quickly snagged a pair of chopsticks and settled into your usual\ndinner perch: on top of the fridge.</p><p>Nat quirked an eyebrow at your strange position. \u201cI see\nthere\u2019s some stuff I\u2019ll have to get used to.\u201d</p><p>Bucky was openly gaping. \u201cHow did you get up there?\u201d</p><p>You grinned at him. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see me transform into a bat?\nI flew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can make herself fly with telekinesis,\u201d Clint informed\nhim with a smirk. \u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>He grabbed for the shrimp floating out of his container but\nit dodged his hand and deposited itself in your mouth. You bit off the tail and\nflicked it at him with a giggle.</p><p>His pouting made you feel a little bad. \u201cI\u2019ll let you have a\nbite of my lo mein,\u201d you offered. Clint reached out his chopsticks and you held\nyour container down where he could reach inside. Once he\u2019d snagged a bite, he\nheaded towards the common room where Sam had started setting up Mario Kart.</p><p>\u201cI want a rematch against Bruce,\u201d Wanda announced as she\njoined the group. \u201cSam and Clint can have their weekly pissing match after I\nget my revenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony finally bought more controllers to replace the ones\nbroken last month,\u201d Steve laughed. \u201cWe\u2019re doing four at a time again.\u201d</p><p>Wanda shrugged. \u201cThen they can do their weekly pissing match\nwhile I get my revenge. I\u2019m not picky.\u201d</p><p>This was your favorite part of living with the others and\nprecisely why you always settled up high where you could watch everything that\nhappened. The team was one big family, teasing each other and having a great\ntime. Sometimes you missed the peacefulness of your own apartment, but by now\nyou wouldn\u2019t trade these evenings for the world.</p><p>You brought your lo mein with you as you transitioned to the\nhammock swing Tony had hung for you in the common room. On the couch, Bruce and\nWanda had settled in for their rematch; Natasha and Steve had snagged the other\ncontrollers. Wanda selected a track and with that, the night of gaming had\nbegun.</p><p>You were so focused on the games happening you didn\u2019t notice\nthat Bucky studied you all evening.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-\u00a0</p><p>Bucky rounded the corner to the kitchen and found you\nperched on a bar stool, a canvas board and paint spread out across the counter.\nYou didn\u2019t notice his arrival until he cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi Bucky!\u201d Your face lit up with its usual smile when\nyou saw him. \u201cHow was your morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo short,\u201d Bucky replied, his voice betraying the fact\nthat he had just woken up despite the fact that it was now the early afternoon.</p><p>You gave him a solemn nod. \u201cI haven\u2019t been on any long\nmissions yet, but the short ones are exhausting and I imagine your body needed\nall the sleep it could get. Coffee pot is fresh even though it\u2019s not full. Tony\njust finished brewing more and he took more than half the pot with him.\u201d</p><p>Bucky poured himself a mug of the offered beverage and\nsurprised you by settling onto the stool next to you.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked, looking at the colors across\nthe canvas.</p><p>\u201cFinger painting.\u201d</p><p>His eyes shot to yours, unsure if you were serious or not.\nYou waggled your paint-stained fingers at him.</p><p>\u201cNothing should get between the artist and their art. I just\ntake that a step further than most.\u201d</p><p>Bucky looked back down at the picture you had were working\non and creased his brow.</p><p>\u201cYou did all of this with your hands?\u201d</p><p>You nodded and tucked your hair behind you ear, leaving a\nsmudge of green behind.</p><p>\u201cIt makes me feel more in touch with what I\u2019m painting. It\u2019s\nkinda like sculpting in two dimentions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept you need more work on your sculpting,\u201d Steve teased\nas he entered the kitchen. He reached into the mug cupboard and pulled out a\nmisshapen monstrosity decorated with a shield design.</p><p>\u201cHey, you still use it,\u201d you grinned at him as he filled the\nmug with the remains of the coffee and set to work brewing more.</p><p>\u201cThat I do,\u201d he laughed. \u201cClint keeps asking when he\u2019ll get\nhis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him I\u2019ll make him one whenever I make it back to the\nstudio.\u201d</p><p>You and Steve fell into an easy conversation. Steve noticed\nBucky alternately studying you and your painting. He tucked it away in his\nmemory as something to think about later.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>\u201cHey, Bucky, have you seen Nat?\u201d</p><p>Bucky looked up from the book he was reading and froze. You\nwere standing with your hands on your hips decked out in the most ridiculous\noutfit he had ever seen. Your t-shirt was neon green and your leggings were\npurple with pink and blue triangles of varying sized across them. There was a\nbright yellow terrycloth headband around your forehead and bright orange bands\non your wrist, and you had pulled your hair up into the biggest side ponytail\nhe had ever seen.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d you prodded when he didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t seen her,\u201d he managed to get out. \u201cUm, what\nare you wearing?\u201d</p><p>You glanced down at your outfit and waved your hand\ndismissively.</p><p>\u201cOh, Clint found an 80s workout video while we were\nthrifting earlier and we decided to try it out. This is just my way of getting\ninto the spirit of it. He thought Nat might want to at least watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch what?\u201d Nat asked, blowing a bubble as she walked in.\nThe bubble popped as she took in your outfit. \u201cNever mind what. The answer is\nyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you find her?\u201d Clint poked his head into the room, a\nneon pink headband the same style as yours wrapped around his head.</p><p>\u201cYup, we\u2019re coming!\u201d you replied, grabbing Nat\u2019s hand and\ndragging her behind you. \u201cSee you later, Bucky!\u201d</p><p>Steve came across his friend half an hour later. Bucky was\nstaring at nothing, his mind still lingering on a certain colorful telekinetic.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>\u201cYou know, stuff like this never happened off-mission before\nyou joined the team.\u201d</p><p>You shrugged at Sam. The movement caused you to wince. \u201cI\u2019d like the record to show that I\ndon\u2019t have a fully-developed frontal lobe yet, but Clint does, and he thought\nit was a great idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich in retrospect probably should have been the first\nindication it was actually a terrible one,\u201d Tony admitted.</p><p>Bruce had Clint laid out in traction until a chiropractor\ncould come to fix his back. You had dislocated your shoulder and were now icing\nit to keep down the swelling and pain from it being forced back in place. Tony\nwas only in the med bay because that was where the two of you were; he was\nbeing forced to listen to Sam and Steve\u2019s \u201chow could you be so reckless\u201d\nlecture because you and Clint probably couldn\u2019t have pulled off your stunt\nwithout him.</p><p>\u201cIt was so fun, though,\u201d Clint retorted from his bed. \u201cHow\nmany people can say they\u2019ve been hit with a six-foot water balloon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne too many,\u201d Steve replied before turning his glare to\nTony. \u201cAnd you! You built them a slingshot?\u201d</p><p>Tony held up his hands. \u201cIn my defense, I only knew they\nwanted to launch a giant water balloon. I didn\u2019t know they were going to aim it\nat Clint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bit was Clint\u2019s idea,\u201d you cut in. \u201cI just wanted to\nlaunch it. He wanted to know what it would feel like to get hit with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was great,\u201d Clint added sleepily. His pain meds seemed\nto be kicking in.</p><p>Bucky watched the whole scene from the doorway and tried to\nfit this piece into the picture of you his mind was forming.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>\u201cPower of positive thinking, Barnes. Power of positive\nthinking.\u201d</p><p>Bucky clenched his jaw and glared at you. \u201cYou\u2019ve been shot.\nThat\u2019s not positive,\u201d he growled, taking out two more HYDRA agents.</p><p>\u201cBut it won\u2019t be fatal and I don\u2019t need my arm to do\ndamage,\u201d you retorted in a sing song voice as you telekinetically ripped a\nman\u2019s gun from his hands and shot him with it. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got to get out of\nhere. Might as well have fun doing it.\u201d You launched into an off-pitch\nrendition of \u201cHakuna Matata\u201d and lobbed a grenade to your left.</p><p>Bucky swore under his breath and followed you toward the\nexit. Going on missions with you would be the death of him.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>\u201cY/N, have you seen \u2013\u201d Bucky entered your room and cut off\nas you shushed him, motioning with your eyes to the sleeping child in your lap.</p><p>The team had rescued a group of orphans on the last mission,\nand Tony had made room for all of them at the compound until they could be\nplaced in good foster homes. One of them, a small girl no older than four, had\nstumbled upon you sitting on the floor and curled up in your lap, promptly\nfalling asleep with her head against your chest. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d you whispered ask Bucky sat next\nto you.</p><p>\u201cHer,\u201d he whispered back. \u201cBruce did a head count and was\nwondering who was missing.\u201d</p><p>You studied the rise and fall of her chest as she breathed\ndeeply. \u201cBruce is remarkably good at mothering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems like you\u2019re not so bad at it yourself.\u201d</p><p>You smiled shyly at Bucky and the two of you sat together in\nsilence until Bruce found you and whisked the girl back to her bed. Bucky felt\na tug of disappointment in his chest when the two of you had to go your\nseparate ways. The more time he spent with you, the more being with you felt\nright.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDude, decorating the tree is so much easier with Y/N\naround,\u201d Clint called to Bucky as the latter entered the common room. Everyone\nwas there bustling around and decorating, but you were what his eyes were\nscanning for.</p><p>You were sitting crisscross on the floor by the couch,\neating sugar cookies and holding Clint up in the air near the top of the tree.\nHe was reaching out to put the star on top when you pretended to drop him.</p><p>\u201cNot cool, Y/N. So not cool.\u201d He glared once you had\nstabilized him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, I prefer being hot anyway,\u201d you smirked back.</p><p>Bucky sat down next to you and took the cookie you offered.</p><p>\u201cThese are pretty good. Who made them?\u201d</p><p>You shrugged. \u201cWhoever Tony bought them from. I was going to\nprotest buying Christmas cookies, but these are better than anything I could\nmake, so I decided to roll with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey guys,\u201d Natasha sang from the couch behind you. \u201cLook\nwhat I found!\u201d</p><p>The two of you looked up to see Nat holding a sprig of\nmistletoe above your heads.</p><p>\u201cGah!\u201d You had actually dropped Clint that time. At least you\nhad been lowering him so he didn\u2019t have as far to fall.</p><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d Your hand came up over your mouth as Clint stumbled\nto his feet. \u201cAre you okay? I\u2019m so sorry, I got distracted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll forgive you if you two kiss,\u201d Sam said with a grin.</p><p>\u201cSure, what he said,\u201d Clint confirmed, rubbing the back of\nhis head. \u201cGo on, kiss him.\u201d</p><p>Chants of \u201cKiss him! Kiss him!\u201d rang out around the room. You\nand Bucky looked at each other, and almost before you could realize it he had\npulled you into his arms and was kissing you. The two of you lost yourselves in\nthe feeling of each other\u2019s lips on your own, deepening the kiss until finally you\nhad to pull back, gasping for air.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time that happened,\u201d you breathed, your faces\nonly a few inches apart.</p><p>\u201cBeen wanting to do that for a while,\u201d Bucky admitted. \u201cI\u2019ve\nnever met anyone like you before, Y/N. You\u2019re perfect. You live through what we\nall go through every mission but still manage to keep a sense of wonder. It\u2019s\u2026\nit\u2019s really nice. It started with the mud puddles; when I first saw you, you\nwere out in the yard splashing around and having so much fun just\u2026 being. The\nmore I get to know you, the more I don\u2019t want to ever have to live without you\nagain. You keep me from losing myself, and I think I\u2019ve fallen in love with\nyou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook what you did,\u201d Clint complained to Natasha. \u201cNow\nthey\u2019re gonna go all lovey on us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Barton,\u201d you laughed before pulling Bucky in for\nanother kiss, whispering something only he could hear.</p><p>\u201cI think I love you, too.\u201d</p>",

You quickly snagged a pair of chopsticks and settled into your usual\ndinner perch: on top of the fridge.</p><p>Nat quirked an eyebrow at your strange position. \u201cI see\nthere\u2019s some stuff I\u2019ll have to get used to.\u201d</p><p>Bucky was openly gaping. \u201cHow did you get up there?\u201d</p><p>You grinned at him. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see me transform into a bat?\nI flew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can make herself fly with telekinesis,\u201d Clint informed\nhim with a smirk. \u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>He grabbed for the shrimp floating out of his container but\nit dodged his hand and deposited itself in your mouth. You bit off the tail and\nflicked it at him with a giggle.</p><p>His pouting made you feel a little bad. \u201cI\u2019ll let you have a\nbite of my lo mein,\u201d you offered. Clint reached out his chopsticks and you held\nyour container down where he could reach inside. Once he\u2019d snagged a bite, he\nheaded towards the common room where Sam had started setting up Mario Kart.</p><p>\u201cI want a rematch against Bruce,\u201d Wanda announced as she\njoined the group. \u201cSam and Clint can have their weekly pissing match after I\nget my revenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony finally bought more controllers to replace the ones\nbroken last month,\u201d Steve laughed. \u201cWe\u2019re doing four at a time again.\u201d</p><p>Wanda shrugged. \u201cThen they can do their weekly pissing match\nwhile I get my revenge. I\u2019m not picky.\u201d</p><p>This was your favorite part of living with the others and\nprecisely why you always settled up high where you could watch everything that\nhappened. The team was one big family, teasing each other and having a great\ntime. Sometimes you missed the peacefulness of your own apartment, but by now\nyou wouldn\u2019t trade these evenings for the world.</p><p>You brought your lo mein with you as you transitioned to the\nhammock swing Tony had hung for you in the common room. On the couch, Bruce and\nWanda had settled in for their rematch; Natasha and Steve had snagged the other\ncontrollers. Wanda selected a track and with that, the night of gaming had\nbegun.</p><p>You were so focused on the games happening you didn\u2019t notice\nthat Bucky studied you all evening.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u00a0</p><p>Bucky rounded the corner to the kitchen and found you\nperched on a bar stool, a canvas board and paint spread out across the counter.\nYou didn\u2019t notice his arrival until he cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi Bucky!\u201d Your face lit up with its usual smile when\nyou saw him. \u201cHow was your morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo short,\u201d Bucky replied, his voice betraying the fact\nthat he had just woken up despite the fact that it was now the early afternoon.</p><p>You gave him a solemn nod. \u201cI haven\u2019t been on any long\nmissions yet, but the short ones are exhausting and I imagine your body needed\nall the sleep it could get. Coffee pot is fresh even though it\u2019s not full. Tony\njust finished brewing more and he took more than half the pot with him.\u201d</p><p>Bucky poured himself a mug of the offered beverage and\nsurprised you by settling onto the stool next to you.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked, looking at the colors across\nthe canvas.</p><p>\u201cFinger painting.\u201d</p><p>His eyes shot to yours, unsure if you were serious or not.\nYou waggled your paint-stained fingers at him.</p><p>\u201cNothing should get between the artist and their art. I just\ntake that a step further than most.\u201d</p><p>Bucky looked back down at the picture you had were working\non and creased his brow.</p><p>\u201cYou did all of this with your hands?\u201d</p><p>You nodded and tucked your hair behind you ear, leaving a\nsmudge of green behind.</p><p>\u201cIt makes me feel more in touch with what I\u2019m painting. It\u2019s\nkinda like sculpting in two dimentions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept you need more work on your sculpting,\u201d Steve teased\nas he entered the kitchen. He reached into the mug cupboard and pulled out a\nmisshapen monstrosity decorated with a shield design.</p><p>\u201cHey, you still use it,\u201d you grinned at him as he filled the\nmug with the remains of the coffee and set to work brewing more.</p><p>\u201cThat I do,\u201d he laughed. \u201cClint keeps asking when he\u2019ll get\nhis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him I\u2019ll make him one whenever I make it back to the\nstudio.\u201d</p><p>You and Steve fell into an easy conversation. Steve noticed\nBucky alternately studying you and your painting. He tucked it away in his\nmemory as something to think about later.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>\u201cHey, Bucky, have you seen Nat?\u201d</p><p>Bucky looked up from the book he was reading and froze. You\nwere standing with your hands on your hips decked out in the most ridiculous\noutfit he had ever seen. Your t-shirt was neon green and your leggings were\npurple with pink and blue triangles of varying sized across them. There was a\nbright yellow terrycloth headband around your forehead and bright orange bands\non your wrist, and you had pulled your hair up into the biggest side ponytail\nhe had ever seen.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d you prodded when he didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t seen her,\u201d he managed to get out. \u201cUm, what\nare you wearing?\u201d</p><p>You glanced down at your outfit and waved your hand\ndismissively.</p><p>\u201cOh, Clint found an 80s workout video while we were\nthrifting earlier and we decided to try it out. This is just my way of getting\ninto the spirit of it. He thought Nat might want to at least watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch what?\u201d Nat asked, blowing a bubble as she walked in.\nThe bubble popped as she took in your outfit. \u201cNever mind what. The answer is\nyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you find her?\u201d Clint poked his head into the room, a\nneon pink headband the same style as yours wrapped around his head.</p><p>\u201cYup, we\u2019re coming!\u201d you replied, grabbing Nat\u2019s hand and\ndragging her behind you. \u201cSee you later, Bucky!\u201d</p><p>Steve came across his friend half an hour later. Bucky was\nstaring at nothing, his mind still lingering on a certain colorful telekinetic.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>\u201cYou know, stuff like this never happened off-mission before\nyou joined the team.\u201d</p><p>You shrugged at Sam. The movement caused you to wince. \u201cI\u2019d like the record to show that I\ndon\u2019t have a fully-developed frontal lobe yet, but Clint does, and he thought\nit was a great idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich in retrospect probably should have been the first\nindication it was actually a terrible one,\u201d Tony admitted.</p><p>Bruce had Clint laid out in traction until a chiropractor\ncould come to fix his back. You had dislocated your shoulder and were now icing\nit to keep down the swelling and pain from it being forced back in place. Tony\nwas only in the med bay because that was where the two of you were; he was\nbeing forced to listen to Sam and Steve\u2019s \u201chow could you be so reckless\u201d\nlecture because you and Clint probably couldn\u2019t have pulled off your stunt\nwithout him.</p><p>\u201cIt was so fun, though,\u201d Clint retorted from his bed. \u201cHow\nmany people can say they\u2019ve been hit with a six-foot water balloon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne too many,\u201d Steve replied before turning his glare to\nTony. \u201cAnd you! You built them a slingshot?\u201d</p><p>Tony held up his hands. \u201cIn my defense, I only knew they\nwanted to launch a giant water balloon. I didn\u2019t know they were going to aim it\nat Clint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bit was Clint\u2019s idea,\u201d you cut in. \u201cI just wanted to\nlaunch it. He wanted to know what it would feel like to get hit with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was great,\u201d Clint added sleepily. His pain meds seemed\nto be kicking in.</p><p>Bucky watched the whole scene from the doorway and tried to\nfit this piece into the picture of you his mind was forming.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>\u201cPower of positive thinking, Barnes. Power of positive\nthinking.\u201d</p><p>Bucky clenched his jaw and glared at you. \u201cYou\u2019ve been shot.\nThat\u2019s not positive,\u201d he growled, taking out two more HYDRA agents.</p><p>\u201cBut it won\u2019t be fatal and I don\u2019t need my arm to do\ndamage,\u201d you retorted in a sing song voice as you telekinetically ripped a\nman\u2019s gun from his hands and shot him with it. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got to get out of\nhere. Might as well have fun doing it.\u201d You launched into an off-pitch\nrendition of \u201cHakuna Matata\u201d and lobbed a grenade to your left.</p><p>Bucky swore under his breath and followed you toward the\nexit. Going on missions with you would be the death of him.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>\u201cY/N, have you seen \u2013\u201d Bucky entered your room and cut off\nas you shushed him, motioning with your eyes to the sleeping child in your lap.</p><p>The team had rescued a group of orphans on the last mission,\nand Tony had made room for all of them at the compound until they could be\nplaced in good foster homes. One of them, a small girl no older than four, had\nstumbled upon you sitting on the floor and curled up in your lap, promptly\nfalling asleep with her head against your chest. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d you whispered ask Bucky sat next\nto you.</p><p>\u201cHer,\u201d he whispered back. \u201cBruce did a head count and was\nwondering who was missing.\u201d</p><p>You studied the rise and fall of her chest as she breathed\ndeeply. \u201cBruce is remarkably good at mothering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems like you\u2019re not so bad at it yourself.\u201d</p><p>You smiled shyly at Bucky and the two of you sat together in\nsilence until Bruce found you and whisked the girl back to her bed. Bucky felt\na tug of disappointment in his chest when the two of you had to go your\nseparate ways. The more time he spent with you, the more being with you felt\nright.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDude, decorating the tree is so much easier with Y/N\naround,\u201d Clint called to Bucky as the latter entered the common room. Everyone\nwas there bustling around and decorating, but you were what his eyes were\nscanning for.</p><p>You were sitting crisscross on the floor by the couch,\neating sugar cookies and holding Clint up in the air near the top of the tree.\nHe was reaching out to put the star on top when you pretended to drop him.</p><p>\u201cNot cool, Y/N. So not cool.\u201d He glared once you had\nstabilized him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, I prefer being hot anyway,\u201d you smirked back.</p><p>Bucky sat down next to you and took the cookie you offered.</p><p>\u201cThese are pretty good. Who made them?\u201d</p><p>You shrugged. \u201cWhoever Tony bought them from. I was going to\nprotest buying Christmas cookies, but these are better than anything I could\nmake, so I decided to roll with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey guys,\u201d Natasha sang from the couch behind you. \u201cLook\nwhat I found!\u201d</p><p>The two of you looked up to see Nat holding a sprig of\nmistletoe above your heads.</p><p>\u201cGah!\u201d You had actually dropped Clint that time. At least you\nhad been lowering him so he didn\u2019t have as far to fall.</p><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d Your hand came up over your mouth as Clint stumbled\nto his feet. \u201cAre you okay? I\u2019m so sorry, I got distracted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll forgive you if you two kiss,\u201d Sam said with a grin.</p><p>\u201cSure, what he said,\u201d Clint confirmed, rubbing the back of\nhis head. \u201cGo on, kiss him.\u201d</p><p>Chants of \u201cKiss him! Kiss him!\u201d rang out around the room. You\nand Bucky looked at each other, and almost before you could realize it he had\npulled you into his arms and was kissing you. The two of you lost yourselves in\nthe feeling of each other\u2019s lips on your own, deepening the kiss until finally you\nhad to pull back, gasping for air.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time that happened,\u201d you breathed, your faces\nonly a few inches apart.</p><p>\u201cBeen wanting to do that for a while,\u201d Bucky admitted. \u201cI\u2019ve\nnever met anyone like you before, Y/N. You\u2019re perfect. You live through what we\nall go through every mission but still manage to keep a sense of wonder. It\u2019s\u2026\nit\u2019s really nice. It started with the mud puddles; when I first saw you, you\nwere out in the yard splashing around and having so much fun just\u2026 being. The\nmore I get to know you, the more I don\u2019t want to ever have to live without you\nagain. You keep me from losing myself, and I think I\u2019ve fallen in love with\nyou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook what you did,\u201d Clint complained to Natasha. \u201cNow\nthey\u2019re gonna go all lovey on us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Barton,\u201d you laughed before pulling Bucky in for\nanother kiss, whispering something only he could hear.</p><p>\u201cI think I love you, too.\u201d</p>",

On the one hand, you wanted to help people, and the Avengers would\ngive you a way to do that on a larger scale. On the other hand, you would have\nto move to their compound in upstate New York. Your tiny apartment in New York\nCity was home; there was no way some compound could ever change that.</p><p>Consider your mind officially changed.</p>[[MORE]]<p>You couldn\u2019t stop the smile that spread across your face as\nyou zipped up your coat. The yellow rain gear and red boots reminded you of\nyour favorite children\u2019s book. It had rained all last night and you couldn\u2019t\nwait to get out in the yard.</p><p>The fresh after-rain scent of the grass and surrounding\ntrees hit your senses and set your heart racing. Rain in New York City left a\nhint of a fresh scent in the air, but it didn\u2019t have what the compound was\nsurrounded by right now: mud puddles.</p><p>With a squeal and a running start, you launched yourself\ninto the first puddle you saw. The splash flew up around you and you felt like\na little kid again. Puddle stomping had been a tradition for you and your\nsiblings after every rainstorm when you were growing up. It had been so long\nsince you had lived where puddles like this formed and you were going to spend\nthe day enjoying them.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>Bucky followed Natasha off the jet and onto the rooftop\nlanding pad. Exhaustion was seeping from every pore and visions of his bed were\ndancing through his mind. It had been a long mission and he was ready to crash.</p><p>Before he could get inside, a laugh from the yard caught his\nattention. He looked over the edge and saw you splashing in the puddles.</p><p><i>Who is that?</i></p><p>Steve came out to welcome Bucky back and found him watching\nyou. The Captain\u2019s face lit up with a soft smile when he saw you splashing\naround.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019ve spotted Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d Bucky couldn\u2019t take his eyes off you.</p><p>\u201cThe newest member of the team.\u201d Steve clapped Bucky on the\nshoulder. \u201cCome on in and get cleaned up, maybe get a few hours of sleep.\nDinner is at seven. I\u2019ll introduce you then.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u00a0</p><p>At six thirty you finally forced yourself to go back inside.\nSeveral splashes had worked their way up your pants and into your boots,\nsoaking you with cold, muddy water. You couldn\u2019t care less.</p><p>You used your half-hour before dinner to dry off and change.\nIt was exactly seven when you padded out of the elevator in your leggings and\nfluffy socks, Tony\u2019s MIT hoodie enveloping you in its warmth. He\u2019d probably\nwant it back once he found out you were the one who stole it. Too bad for him;\nit was your new favorite item of clothing.</p><p>Most of the team and two people you hadn\u2019t met were\nshuffling around the kitchen and dining room, determining the contents of\nvarious Chinese takeout containers and distributing them to the correct recipients.\nSince arriving, you had learned that Tuesdays were for takeout and video games.\nIt was your favorite night of the week.</p><p>\u201cY/N, I\u2019ve got some people for you to meet,\u201d Steve called\nwhen he spotted you. He motioned to the two you didn\u2019t recognize. \u201cThis is\nNatasha, and this is Bucky. They just got back from a pretty long mission,\nwhich is why they haven\u2019t met you yet. Guys, this is Y/N, our new resident\ntelekinetic.\u201d</p><p>You smiled at Nat, a bit nervous at meeting the famous Black\nWidow. \u201cNice to meet you both.\u201d You turned to Bucky. \u201cI hope the mission went\nokay?\u201d</p><p>Nat waved her hand. \u201cIt turned out in the end. I think we\u2019re\nboth just glad to be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a telekinetic?\u201d You weren\u2019t sure what the look on\nBucky\u2019s face as he asked meant, but you replied before you could stop yourself.</p><p>\u201cNo, I actually just shapeshift into a huge bat. Travel by\necholocation, eat fruit flies, sleep upside-down \u2013 stuff like that. Not sure\nwhy they thought I should be an Avenger.\u201d</p><p>Clint cracked up and Bruce smiled, handing you a container.\nYou accepted it and peeked inside. God bless Bruce; beef lo mein was your\nfavorite. You quickly snagged a pair of chopsticks and settled into your usual\ndinner perch: on top of the fridge.</p><p>Nat quirked an eyebrow at your strange position. \u201cI see\nthere\u2019s some stuff I\u2019ll have to get used to.\u201d</p><p>Bucky was openly gaping. \u201cHow did you get up there?\u201d</p><p>You grinned at him. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see me transform into a bat?\nI flew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can make herself fly with telekinesis,\u201d Clint informed\nhim with a smirk. \u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>He grabbed for the shrimp floating out of his container but\nit dodged his hand and deposited itself in your mouth. You bit off the tail and\nflicked it at him with a giggle.</p><p>His pouting made you feel a little bad. \u201cI\u2019ll let you have a\nbite of my lo mein,\u201d you offered. Clint reached out his chopsticks and you held\nyour container down where he could reach inside. Once he\u2019d snagged a bite, he\nheaded towards the common room where Sam had started setting up Mario Kart.</p><p>\u201cI want a rematch against Bruce,\u201d Wanda announced as she\njoined the group. \u201cSam and Clint can have their weekly pissing match after I\nget my revenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony finally bought more controllers to replace the ones\nbroken last month,\u201d Steve laughed. \u201cWe\u2019re doing four at a time again.\u201d</p><p>Wanda shrugged. \u201cThen they can do their weekly pissing match\nwhile I get my revenge. I\u2019m not picky.\u201d</p><p>This was your favorite part of living with the others and\nprecisely why you always settled up high where you could watch everything that\nhappened. The team was one big family, teasing each other and having a great\ntime. Sometimes you missed the peacefulness of your own apartment, but by now\nyou wouldn\u2019t trade these evenings for the world.</p><p>You brought your lo mein with you as you transitioned to the\nhammock swing Tony had hung for you in the common room. On the couch, Bruce and\nWanda had settled in for their rematch; Natasha and Steve had snagged the other\ncontrollers. Wanda selected a track and with that, the night of gaming had\nbegun.</p><p>You were so focused on the games happening you didn\u2019t notice\nthat Bucky studied you all evening.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u00a0</p><p>Bucky rounded the corner to the kitchen and found you\nperched on a bar stool, a canvas board and paint spread out across the counter.\nYou didn\u2019t notice his arrival until he cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi Bucky!\u201d Your face lit up with its usual smile when\nyou saw him. \u201cHow was your morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo short,\u201d Bucky replied, his voice betraying the fact\nthat he had just woken up despite the fact that it was now the early afternoon.</p><p>You gave him a solemn nod. \u201cI haven\u2019t been on any long\nmissions yet, but the short ones are exhausting and I imagine your body needed\nall the sleep it could get. Coffee pot is fresh even though it\u2019s not full. Tony\njust finished brewing more and he took more than half the pot with him.\u201d</p><p>Bucky poured himself a mug of the offered beverage and\nsurprised you by settling onto the stool next to you.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked, looking at the colors across\nthe canvas.</p><p>\u201cFinger painting.\u201d</p><p>His eyes shot to yours, unsure if you were serious or not.\nYou waggled your paint-stained fingers at him.</p><p>\u201cNothing should get between the artist and their art. I just\ntake that a step further than most.\u201d</p><p>Bucky looked back down at the picture you had were working\non and creased his brow.</p><p>\u201cYou did all of this with your hands?\u201d</p><p>You nodded and tucked your hair behind you ear, leaving a\nsmudge of green behind.</p><p>\u201cIt makes me feel more in touch with what I\u2019m painting. It\u2019s\nkinda like sculpting in two dimentions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept you need more work on your sculpting,\u201d Steve teased\nas he entered the kitchen. He reached into the mug cupboard and pulled out a\nmisshapen monstrosity decorated with a shield design.</p><p>\u201cHey, you still use it,\u201d you grinned at him as he filled the\nmug with the remains of the coffee and set to work brewing more.</p><p>\u201cThat I do,\u201d he laughed. \u201cClint keeps asking when he\u2019ll get\nhis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him I\u2019ll make him one whenever I make it back to the\nstudio.\u201d</p><p>You and Steve fell into an easy conversation. Steve noticed\nBucky alternately studying you and your painting. He tucked it away in his\nmemory as something to think about later.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>\u201cHey, Bucky, have you seen Nat?\u201d</p><p>Bucky looked up from the book he was reading and froze. You\nwere standing with your hands on your hips decked out in the most ridiculous\noutfit he had ever seen. Your t-shirt was neon green and your leggings were\npurple with pink and blue triangles of varying sized across them. There was a\nbright yellow terrycloth headband around your forehead and bright orange bands\non your wrist, and you had pulled your hair up into the biggest side ponytail\nhe had ever seen.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d you prodded when he didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t seen her,\u201d he managed to get out. \u201cUm, what\nare you wearing?\u201d</p><p>You glanced down at your outfit and waved your hand\ndismissively.</p><p>\u201cOh, Clint found an 80s workout video while we were\nthrifting earlier and we decided to try it out. This is just my way of getting\ninto the spirit of it. He thought Nat might want to at least watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch what?\u201d Nat asked, blowing a bubble as she walked in.\nThe bubble popped as she took in your outfit. \u201cNever mind what. The answer is\nyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you find her?\u201d Clint poked his head into the room, a\nneon pink headband the same style as yours wrapped around his head.</p><p>\u201cYup, we\u2019re coming!\u201d you replied, grabbing Nat\u2019s hand and\ndragging her behind you. \u201cSee you later, Bucky!\u201d</p><p>Steve came across his friend half an hour later. Bucky was\nstaring at nothing, his mind still lingering on a certain colorful telekinetic.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>\u201cYou know, stuff like this never happened off-mission before\nyou joined the team.\u201d</p><p>You shrugged at Sam. The movement caused you to wince. \u201cI\u2019d like the record to show that I\ndon\u2019t have a fully-developed frontal lobe yet, but Clint does, and he thought\nit was a great idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich in retrospect probably should have been the first\nindication it was actually a terrible one,\u201d Tony admitted.</p><p>Bruce had Clint laid out in traction until a chiropractor\ncould come to fix his back. You had dislocated your shoulder and were now icing\nit to keep down the swelling and pain from it being forced back in place. Tony\nwas only in the med bay because that was where the two of you were; he was\nbeing forced to listen to Sam and Steve\u2019s \u201chow could you be so reckless\u201d\nlecture because you and Clint probably couldn\u2019t have pulled off your stunt\nwithout him.</p><p>\u201cIt was so fun, though,\u201d Clint retorted from his bed. \u201cHow\nmany people can say they\u2019ve been hit with a six-foot water balloon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne too many,\u201d Steve replied before turning his glare to\nTony. \u201cAnd you! You built them a slingshot?\u201d</p><p>Tony held up his hands. \u201cIn my defense, I only knew they\nwanted to launch a giant water balloon. I didn\u2019t know they were going to aim it\nat Clint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bit was Clint\u2019s idea,\u201d you cut in. \u201cI just wanted to\nlaunch it. He wanted to know what it would feel like to get hit with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was great,\u201d Clint added sleepily. His pain meds seemed\nto be kicking in.</p><p>Bucky watched the whole scene from the doorway and tried to\nfit this piece into the picture of you his mind was forming.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>\u201cPower of positive thinking, Barnes. Power of positive\nthinking.\u201d</p><p>Bucky clenched his jaw and glared at you. \u201cYou\u2019ve been shot.\nThat\u2019s not positive,\u201d he growled, taking out two more HYDRA agents.</p><p>\u201cBut it won\u2019t be fatal and I don\u2019t need my arm to do\ndamage,\u201d you retorted in a sing song voice as you telekinetically ripped a\nman\u2019s gun from his hands and shot him with it. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got to get out of\nhere. Might as well have fun doing it.\u201d You launched into an off-pitch\nrendition of \u201cHakuna Matata\u201d and lobbed a grenade to your left.</p><p>Bucky swore under his breath and followed you toward the\nexit. Going on missions with you would be the death of him.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>\u201cY/N, have you seen \u2013\u201d Bucky entered your room and cut off\nas you shushed him, motioning with your eyes to the sleeping child in your lap.</p><p>The team had rescued a group of orphans on the last mission,\nand Tony had made room for all of them at the compound until they could be\nplaced in good foster homes. One of them, a small girl no older than four, had\nstumbled upon you sitting on the floor and curled up in your lap, promptly\nfalling asleep with her head against your chest. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d you whispered ask Bucky sat next\nto you.</p><p>\u201cHer,\u201d he whispered back. \u201cBruce did a head count and was\nwondering who was missing.\u201d</p><p>You studied the rise and fall of her chest as she breathed\ndeeply. \u201cBruce is remarkably good at mothering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems like you\u2019re not so bad at it yourself.\u201d</p><p>You smiled shyly at Bucky and the two of you sat together in\nsilence until Bruce found you and whisked the girl back to her bed. Bucky felt\na tug of disappointment in his chest when the two of you had to go your\nseparate ways. The more time he spent with you, the more being with you felt\nright.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDude, decorating the tree is so much easier with Y/N\naround,\u201d Clint called to Bucky as the latter entered the common room. Everyone\nwas there bustling around and decorating, but you were what his eyes were\nscanning for.</p><p>You were sitting crisscross on the floor by the couch,\neating sugar cookies and holding Clint up in the air near the top of the tree.\nHe was reaching out to put the star on top when you pretended to drop him.</p><p>\u201cNot cool, Y/N. So not cool.\u201d He glared once you had\nstabilized him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, I prefer being hot anyway,\u201d you smirked back.</p><p>Bucky sat down next to you and took the cookie you offered.</p><p>\u201cThese are pretty good. Who made them?\u201d</p><p>You shrugged. \u201cWhoever Tony bought them from. I was going to\nprotest buying Christmas cookies, but these are better than anything I could\nmake, so I decided to roll with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey guys,\u201d Natasha sang from the couch behind you. \u201cLook\nwhat I found!\u201d</p><p>The two of you looked up to see Nat holding a sprig of\nmistletoe above your heads.</p><p>\u201cGah!\u201d You had actually dropped Clint that time. At least you\nhad been lowering him so he didn\u2019t have as far to fall.</p><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d Your hand came up over your mouth as Clint stumbled\nto his feet. \u201cAre you okay? I\u2019m so sorry, I got distracted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll forgive you if you two kiss,\u201d Sam said with a grin.</p><p>\u201cSure, what he said,\u201d Clint confirmed, rubbing the back of\nhis head. \u201cGo on, kiss him.\u201d</p><p>Chants of \u201cKiss him! Kiss him!\u201d rang out around the room. You\nand Bucky looked at each other, and almost before you could realize it he had\npulled you into his arms and was kissing you. The two of you lost yourselves in\nthe feeling of each other\u2019s lips on your own, deepening the kiss until finally you\nhad to pull back, gasping for air.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time that happened,\u201d you breathed, your faces\nonly a few inches apart.</p><p>\u201cBeen wanting to do that for a while,\u201d Bucky admitted. \u201cI\u2019ve\nnever met anyone like you before, Y/N. You\u2019re perfect. You live through what we\nall go through every mission but still manage to keep a sense of wonder. It\u2019s\u2026\nit\u2019s really nice. It started with the mud puddles; when I first saw you, you\nwere out in the yard splashing around and having so much fun just\u2026 being. The\nmore I get to know you, the more I don\u2019t want to ever have to live without you\nagain. You keep me from losing myself, and I think I\u2019ve fallen in love with\nyou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook what you did,\u201d Clint complained to Natasha. \u201cNow\nthey\u2019re gonna go all lovey on us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Barton,\u201d you laughed before pulling Bucky in for\nanother kiss, whispering something only he could hear.</p><p>\u201cI think I love you, too.\u201d</p>",

Feedback is always appreciated.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>You had had mixed feelings when you were asked to join the\nAvengers. On the one hand, you wanted to help people, and the Avengers would\ngive you a way to do that on a larger scale. On the other hand, you would have\nto move to their compound in upstate New York. Your tiny apartment in New York\nCity was home; there was no way some compound could ever change that.</p><p>Consider your mind officially changed.</p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t stop the smile that spread across your face as\nyou zipped up your coat. The yellow rain gear and red boots reminded you of\nyour favorite children&rsquo;s book. It had rained all last night and you couldn&rsquo;t\nwait to get out in the yard.</p><p>The fresh after-rain scent of the grass and surrounding\ntrees hit your senses and set your heart racing. Rain in New York City left a\nhint of a fresh scent in the air, but it didn&rsquo;t have what the compound was\nsurrounded by right now: mud puddles.</p><p>With a squeal and a running start, you launched yourself\ninto the first puddle you saw. The splash flew up around you and you felt like\na little kid again. Puddle stomping had been a tradition for you and your\nsiblings after every rainstorm when you were growing up. It had been so long\nsince you had lived where puddles like this formed and you were going to spend\nthe day enjoying them.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>Bucky followed Natasha off the jet and onto the rooftop\nlanding pad. Exhaustion was seeping from every pore and visions of his bed were\ndancing through his mind. It had been a long mission and he was ready to crash.</p><p>Before he could get inside, a laugh from the yard caught his\nattention. He looked over the edge and saw you splashing in the puddles.</p><p><i>Who is that?</i></p><p>Steve came out to welcome Bucky back and found him watching\nyou. The Captain&rsquo;s face lit up with a soft smile when he saw you splashing\naround.</p><p>&ldquo;I see you&rsquo;ve spotted Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; Bucky couldn&rsquo;t take his eyes off you.</p><p>&ldquo;The newest member of the team.&rdquo; Steve clapped Bucky on the\nshoulder. &ldquo;Come on in and get cleaned up, maybe get a few hours of sleep.\nDinner is at seven. I&rsquo;ll introduce you then.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-&nbsp;</p><p>At six thirty you finally forced yourself to go back inside.\nSeveral splashes had worked their way up your pants and into your boots,\nsoaking you with cold, muddy water. You couldn&rsquo;t care less.</p><p>You used your half-hour before dinner to dry off and change.\nIt was exactly seven when you padded out of the elevator in your leggings and\nfluffy socks, Tony&rsquo;s MIT hoodie enveloping you in its warmth. He&rsquo;d probably\nwant it back once he found out you were the one who stole it. Too bad for him;\nit was your new favorite item of clothing.</p><p>Most of the team and two people you hadn&rsquo;t met were\nshuffling around the kitchen and dining room, determining the contents of\nvarious Chinese takeout containers and distributing them to the correct recipients.\nSince arriving, you had learned that Tuesdays were for takeout and video games.\nIt was your favorite night of the week.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, I&rsquo;ve got some people for you to meet,&rdquo; Steve called\nwhen he spotted you. He motioned to the two you didn&rsquo;t recognize. &ldquo;This is\nNatasha, and this is Bucky. They just got back from a pretty long mission,\nwhich is why they haven&rsquo;t met you yet. Guys, this is Y/N, our new resident\ntelekinetic.&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled at Nat, a bit nervous at meeting the famous Black\nWidow. &ldquo;Nice to meet you both.&rdquo; You turned to Bucky. &ldquo;I hope the mission went\nokay?&rdquo;</p><p>Nat waved her hand. &ldquo;It turned out in the end. I think we&rsquo;re\nboth just glad to be back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a telekinetic?&rdquo; You weren&rsquo;t sure what the look on\nBucky&rsquo;s face as he asked meant, but you replied before you could stop yourself.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I actually just shapeshift into a huge bat. Travel by\necholocation, eat fruit flies, sleep upside-down &ndash; stuff like that. Not sure\nwhy they thought I should be an Avenger.&rdquo;</p><p>Clint cracked up and Bruce smiled, handing you a container.\nYou accepted it and peeked inside. God bless Bruce; beef lo mein was your\nfavorite. You quickly snagged a pair of chopsticks and settled into your usual\ndinner perch: on top of the fridge.</p><p>Nat quirked an eyebrow at your strange position. &ldquo;I see\nthere&rsquo;s some stuff I&rsquo;ll have to get used to.&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky was openly gaping. &ldquo;How did you get up there?&rdquo;</p><p>You grinned at him. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you see me transform into a bat?\nI flew.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She can make herself fly with telekinesis,&rdquo; Clint informed\nhim with a smirk. &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;</p><p>He grabbed for the shrimp floating out of his container but\nit dodged his hand and deposited itself in your mouth. You bit off the tail and\nflicked it at him with a giggle.</p><p>His pouting made you feel a little bad. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you have a\nbite of my lo mein,&rdquo; you offered. Clint reached out his chopsticks and you held\nyour container down where he could reach inside. Once he&rsquo;d snagged a bite, he\nheaded towards the common room where Sam had started setting up Mario Kart.</p><p>&ldquo;I want a rematch against Bruce,&rdquo; Wanda announced as she\njoined the group. &ldquo;Sam and Clint can have their weekly pissing match after I\nget my revenge.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony finally bought more controllers to replace the ones\nbroken last month,&rdquo; Steve laughed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re doing four at a time again.&rdquo;</p><p>Wanda shrugged. &ldquo;Then they can do their weekly pissing match\nwhile I get my revenge. I&rsquo;m not picky.&rdquo;</p><p>This was your favorite part of living with the others and\nprecisely why you always settled up high where you could watch everything that\nhappened. The team was one big family, teasing each other and having a great\ntime. Sometimes you missed the peacefulness of your own apartment, but by now\nyou wouldn&rsquo;t trade these evenings for the world.</p><p>You brought your lo mein with you as you transitioned to the\nhammock swing Tony had hung for you in the common room. On the couch, Bruce and\nWanda had settled in for their rematch; Natasha and Steve had snagged the other\ncontrollers. Wanda selected a track and with that, the night of gaming had\nbegun.</p><p>You were so focused on the games happening you didn&rsquo;t notice\nthat Bucky studied you all evening.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-&nbsp;</p><p>Bucky rounded the corner to the kitchen and found you\nperched on a bar stool, a canvas board and paint spread out across the counter.\nYou didn&rsquo;t notice his arrival until he cleared his throat.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, hi Bucky!&rdquo; Your face lit up with its usual smile when\nyou saw him. &ldquo;How was your morning?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Too short,&rdquo; Bucky replied, his voice betraying the fact\nthat he had just woken up despite the fact that it was now the early afternoon.</p><p>You gave him a solemn nod. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been on any long\nmissions yet, but the short ones are exhausting and I imagine your body needed\nall the sleep it could get.

The more time he spent with you, the more being with you felt\nright.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Dude, decorating the tree is so much easier with Y/N\naround,&rdquo; Clint called to Bucky as the latter entered the common room. Everyone\nwas there bustling around and decorating, but you were what his eyes were\nscanning for.</p><p>You were sitting crisscross on the floor by the couch,\neating sugar cookies and holding Clint up in the air near the top of the tree.\nHe was reaching out to put the star on top when you pretended to drop him.</p><p>&ldquo;Not cool, Y/N. So not cool.&rdquo; He glared once you had\nstabilized him.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay, I prefer being hot anyway,&rdquo; you smirked back.</p><p>Bucky sat down next to you and took the cookie you offered.</p><p>&ldquo;These are pretty good. Who made them?&rdquo;</p><p>You shrugged. &ldquo;Whoever Tony bought them from. I was going to\nprotest buying Christmas cookies, but these are better than anything I could\nmake, so I decided to roll with it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey guys,&rdquo; Natasha sang from the couch behind you. &ldquo;Look\nwhat I found!&rdquo;</p><p>The two of you looked up to see Nat holding a sprig of\nmistletoe above your heads.</p><p>&ldquo;Gah!&rdquo; You had actually dropped Clint that time. At least you\nhad been lowering him so he didn&rsquo;t have as far to fall.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry!&rdquo; Your hand came up over your mouth as Clint stumbled\nto his feet. &ldquo;Are you okay? I&rsquo;m so sorry, I got distracted.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll forgive you if you two kiss,&rdquo; Sam said with a grin.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure, what he said,&rdquo; Clint confirmed, rubbing the back of\nhis head. &ldquo;Go on, kiss him.&rdquo;</p><p>Chants of &ldquo;Kiss him! Kiss him!&rdquo; rang out around the room. You\nand Bucky looked at each other, and almost before you could realize it he had\npulled you into his arms and was kissing you. The two of you lost yourselves in\nthe feeling of each other&rsquo;s lips on your own, deepening the kiss until finally you\nhad to pull back, gasping for air.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about time that happened,&rdquo; you breathed, your faces\nonly a few inches apart.</p><p>&ldquo;Been wanting to do that for a while,&rdquo; Bucky admitted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve\nnever met anyone like you before, Y/N. You&rsquo;re perfect. You live through what we\nall go through every mission but still manage to keep a sense of wonder. It&rsquo;s&hellip;\nit&rsquo;s really nice. It started with the mud puddles; when I first saw you, you\nwere out in the yard splashing around and having so much fun just&hellip; being. The\nmore I get to know you, the more I don&rsquo;t want to ever have to live without you\nagain. You keep me from losing myself, and I think I&rsquo;ve fallen in love with\nyou.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look what you did,&rdquo; Clint complained to Natasha. &ldquo;Now\nthey&rsquo;re gonna go all lovey on us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up, Barton,&rdquo; you laughed before pulling Bucky in for\nanother kiss, whispering something only he could hear.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I love you, too.&rdquo;</p>",
