This chapter may be a little bit body horror-esque&hellip;</b></p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/18710131/chapters/44375614\"><b>Read from the beginning on AO3 if you prefer!</b></a></p><p>\u201cWe must find a puppet,\u201d said Loki, and Tony\u2019s breath was ripped from him again as they teleported, Spectre style into the middle of Wall Street.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Peter gasped, staggering forwards.</p><p>Tony hauled him back up. \u201cPretty damn cool, huh?\u201d he grinned. Peter nodded, his eyes sparkling.</p><p>Loki shook his head. \u201cYou two are the most\u2026 unusual of Monks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormal is boring,\u201d said Tony, waving a hand. \u201cNow, puppets - what are we looking for?\u201d</p><p>Loki waved a hand and the bustling crowd around them went dark. The people continued to walk, unnoticing, but Tony could see right through them to a glow in their core, the world behind them black and featureless.</p><p>\u201cThe Hydra reaches up, its tendrils burrowing into the core of those whose soul is rotting,\u201d said Loki, his voice a deep rumble. \u201cIt feeds, and replaces, and leaves behind a puppet, walking and wielding power, and outwardly indistinguishable from the narcissistic, greedy scum it was before.\u201d</p><p>Tony and Peter exchanged looks. \u201cWell, we\u2019re in the right place in Wall Street, I guess,\u201d Peter shrugged.</p><!-- more --><p>Loki was silent, watching. Suddenly he pointed. \u201cThere,\u201d he said, and pulled them through space fifty yards or so down the street.</p><p>Tony coughed. \u201cBit of warning, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you see it?\u201d Loki asked. He pointed towards a man in a suit, the same as every other besuited man on the street, pinstripes and briefcase and mobile phone up by his ear. But instead of the glow in his core, pulsing under the solar plexus, the man had a solid, dull silver tentacle.</p><p>The tip of the tentacle was buried in the man\u2019s head, spreading throughout his brain. From there it sank through his body and down, down into the earth where it disappeared into the darkness. Tony cleared his throat. \u201cWell. Yeah. That\u2019s, uh\u2026 disgusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it killing him?\u201d Peter asked, eyes wide as he watched the man pause on a street corner to snap into the phone.</p><p>\u201cHe is long dead,\u201d Loki said. \u201cHe is but a puppet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026 we can\u2019t save him,\u201d Peter said, and Tony wanted to hug the kid. At least he knew even if Tony himself became evil, Pete would still want to help him.</p><p>Yeah, better not encourage such levels of idealism, really.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do, then?\u201d Tony asked.</p><p>\u201cFollow him down,\u201d said Loki, and rushed forwards, a swirl of ravens cawing as his spirit split into thousands of the birds.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Tony muttered, racing after him. Peter shot out a strand of his own Spectral spirit that wrapped itself around the wildly thrashing puppet. The man started to <i>melt</i>, the tendril retracting into the earth and leaving the body behind, folding itself up on the floor like a rubber suit.</p><p>Before Tony could retch, or react in any way, he felt strong arms snatching him up from the cloud of ravens, and the three of them rushed through the body, through the earth, following the retreating tentacle.</p><p>Tony forced his hysterical mind away from the fact that he\u2019d just dived through a boneless body on the floor and was currently diving into the bowels of the earth after a Hydra. \u201cI\u2019m good under pressure, I\u2019m good under pressure,\u201d he muttered, gritting his teeth and clinging onto Loki.</p><p>They reached a horizontal tunnel at last, and the tentacle whipped away ahead of them as they touched down. Loki\u2019s ravens coalesced back into his human form, Peter\u2019s Spectre strand tugged back into his hand, and the three of them looked at each other, breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cYou have been here before, Peter,\u201d said Loki. \u201cCan you tell the best direction?\u201d</p><p>Peter looked slightly panicked, then frowned. \u201cYeah, actually. That way.\u201d He pointed straight into a wall.</p><p>Tony\u2019s eyebrows raised. \u201cGood thing I brought blasting powder.\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head. \u201cNo, no, we can just walk through,\u201d he said. \u201cC\u2019mon, I can hear them!\u201d</p><p>Tony frowned and looked around, hearing nothing but silence. Loki shrugged. \u201cI do not hear it either.\u201d</p><p>Peter led them into the wall, pressing into the spongy loam which parted as he moved, and then closed again behind them. Tony shuddered. \u201cUh, this would be a bad time to tell you that I\u2019m a bit claustrophobic, yeah?\u201d</p><p>Loki turned to smirk at him, but he felt a long-fingered hand tuck into his own. He considered feeling insulted, but it felt too nice. He slipped his own fingers between Loki\u2019s and grinned up at him.</p><p>They walked in silence for time that Tony didn\u2019t even bother trying to measure. ADHD always turned that into a bitch anyway, wasn\u2019t much point when he couldn\u2019t see clocks or the sun. He just followed Peter as he turned and pushed on, and when they pushed into a vast cavern, he blinked, like he\u2019d forgotten that\u2019s what space looked like.</p><p>Peter gasped and ran across the room. \u201cTeddy, Kate - you guys OK?\u201d</p><p>Tony and Loki followed him over, Tony casting a ball of magelight which he threw up into the air to cast a golden glow over the room full of\u2026 \u201cJesus Christ,\u201d he muttered. \u201cHow many kids are stuck down here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifty three,\u201d said a skinny boy with huge eyes. \u201cWe count off every evening.\u201d</p><p>Peter was bustling between the bundles of rags and slow-moving limbs, squeezing shoulders, pulling kids into a sitting position, touching faces. Tony reached down to the boy who\u2019d spoken. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid,\u201d he said, taking his hand and hauling himself up, but looking at Tony only out of the corner of his eye.</p><p>\u201cCan everyone walk? Does anyone need carrying out of here?\u201d</p><p>David snorted. \u201cYeah, don\u2019t give us false hope, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe got down here, we\u2019re getting you all back up,\u201d Tony said, still looking around and planning.</p><p>\u201cThe one-armed man\u2019ll be back soon,\u201d said a tough-looking girl, pushing herself to her feet. \u201cYou got no chance. Welcome to hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we shall need help,\u201d Loki said thoughtfully. He tipped his head back and whistled, shrill enough that Tony ducked and clapped his hands over his ears.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Lokes? You want to call the Hydra down on our ears?\u201d</p><p>Loki smirked at him. A white cloud appeared behind his back, particles of light swirling around and coalescing into three distinct shapes. Tony sighed. \u201cHey triplets.\u201d</p><p>Hela smiled, the ragged gash in her skin shifting over her face and leaving the grin on her eyes alone. Jormungandr, in human form, looked around at the room full of ragged children, then shifted into a massive dragon, making a couple of smaller kids scream.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, he\u2019s a friend!\u201d Peter yelled. \u201cUh, Mr Loki, do you think&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\u201cClimb onto Jormungandr\u2019s back,\u201d Loki said. \u201cWe will help you if you cannot, and he will fly you to your freedom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t be real,\u201d said an auburn haired boy weakly, leaning on a big blond guy who wrapped his arms protectively around his shoulders. \u201cThis can\u2019t\u2026 it\u2019s a dream.\u201d He pressed his face into the blond\u2019s chest, exhausted.</p><p>\u201cI told you I\u2019d come back, Billy,\u201d said Peter gently. He glanced up at blondie. \u201cTeddy, can you get him up onto Jor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this for real, Pete?\u201d Teddy asked, frowning. \u201cThe one-armed man took you, we thought you\u2019d be torn apart like\u2026 like all the others and then\u2026 now you\u2019re back here?\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded. \u201cYou know I said I\u2019m an apprentice Monk? This is my master, Tony. He got Loki to help find me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s a Spectre,\u201d said the tough girl. \u201cMonks don\u2019t work with Spectres.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmerica,\u201d Teddy warned.</p><p>\u201cNah, Ted, we can\u2019t trust these guys - we were all grabbed by a Spectre, we\u2019ve been held here for weeks by one massive Spectre that seems to spread across the whole earth, I\u2019m not going with another one. Out of the frying pan, into the fire?\u201d</p><p>Fenrir bounded up in his wolf form, tongue lolling, then, in a swirl of power, switched back to his human form. \u201cAmerica!\u201d he yelled, grabbing her in a hug.</p><p>\u201cFenrir? You\u2019re&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here! We looked for you! Why did you go? I missed you! I told Loki and he said he\u2019d look! We\u2019re here to get you out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Spectre?\u201d America said, mouth open.</p><p>\u201cYup yup. Wolf form. Spectre. Want a ride? I can run real fast. Where\u2019s Kate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, she\u2019s there\u2026\u201d America pointed at a dark haired girl, who pushed through the group to her side. \u201cYou\u2019re a <i>Spectre?\u201d</i></p><p>Tony looked around the room. Hela was hugging a group of smaller children, and Jormungandr was switching back to his human form to talk to a different group of teenagers. Peter grinned at America. \u201cCan we rescue you now?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, dazed. Fenrir scooped her up into an enthusiastic hug, and she laughed, patting his back before he shifted into a wolf form and raced off. \u201cShit, yeah, let\u2019s do this. Shit. Teddy, we\u2019re getting out of here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJor?\u201d Peter yelled. The giant dragon-snake rematerialised, and this time, the kids were much faster at scrambling up onto his back. Tony helped Teddy lift Billy onto Jor\u2019s back, steadying him until Teddy could wrap him up in his arms again.</p><p>Then there was a scream at the edge of the cavern, and a roaring snarl from Fenrir. Blood running cold, Tony raced over as fast as he could, Loki splitting into his ravens. At a doorway there stood a black-haired man, his long hair hanging over his face. His nose and mouth were obscured by a jawbone mask, and one arm shimmered, shifting and pulsing with Specral power. \u201cSpeed it up, kids,\u201d Tony yelled, keeping his eyes fixed on the one-armed man.</p><p>For a moment the three of them stared at each other, the noise of fifty three children scrambling to climb onto Jor a panicked rustle behind Tony and Loki. Then the man leaped into action, hurling himself at Tony. Tony shifted, smashing a vial of flame at his feet. The Spectral arm shot out, siphoning up the flames with barely a glance, and the man spun, his flesh arm nearly connecting with Tony\u2019s jaw. Tony raised a hand to block, the strength of the strike vibrating every bone, making him gasp.</p><p>Loki split into ravens and flew at the man, trying to separate him from Tony, but the man kicked out, thumping into Tony\u2019s lower back. Tony dropped to his knee, the adrenaline keeping him from crying out, and swung his arm, knocking the man\u2019s leg out from under him. He fell onto his back, whipped his feet, and flipped himself upright, but Tony had at least managed to scramble backwards, out of the way.</p><p>With a hair-raising scream, Loki dived towards the man, every raven shrieking and coalescing around him. Tony pushed himself to his feet, heart pounding, watching in sickening horror as the ravens whirled around the man in a wild storm. Suddenly there was a rending, ripping noise and the ravens parted, all flying away in unison, looking down, calculating. There on the floor lay the broken man, his shimmering arm gone, his bare face contorted in pain and turned towards Tony.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Tony breathed. \u201cIt\u2019s Bucky fucking Barnes.\u201d</p><p>Loki\u2019s ravens seemed to hang in the air, the world taking in a long breath before the scream, and then, delicate and elegant, dived back down to destroy the most famous missing Monk in history.</p><p>Tony raced forwards, screaming and waving his arms. \u201cLoki, no! It\u2019s Barnes, leave him, no!\u201d</p><p>He bent over Barnes\u2019 body, eyes squeezed shut in terror. The rattle of thousands of feathers and wings trying to change direction filled every sense, and he threw his arms up over his head even as he hunched over Barnes\u2019 chest and face. There was a storm of buffeting wind, of beating wings, a brush of feathers, and nothing. Tony squeezed his eyes open.</p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d Loki said, panting and standing over Tony with dark, angry eyes. \u201cYou are a fucking idiot.\u201d</p><p>Tony burst out laughing, high and terrified. \u201cShit, I know, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is the meaning of this?\u201d Loki snapped.</p><p>Tony looked back down at the man beneath him. \u201cWhen I was a kid, Barnes was this&hellip; legend. A Monk who went missing during the final battle of the great Monk-Spectre war, no trace of him whatsoever. Everyone thought he was vaporised, him and Captain America, but\u2026\u201d He breathed out hard. \u201cI grew up with pictures of him and his team all over the house.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cMy dad worked with them. Never let me hear the end of it, how I\u2019d never be as good as Barnes, as any of the Howling.\u201d He smirked up at Loki, cocky. \u201cI got better.\u201d</p><p>Loki raised an eyebrow and smiled back. \u201cYou did.\u201d He bent down to lift Barnes, who groaned weakly. \u201cHis soul was entangled with a shard of the Hydra\u2019s,\u201d he said as he straightened.</p><p>\u201cYou mean he was a puppet?\u201d Tony asked, eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Loki said. \u201cMore like\u2026 how Peter is now. Only the Hydra\u2019s power was akin to an infection, at war with him. Mine is given gladly, and will work with Peter. It is his now.\u201d</p><p>Tony looked down at Barnes, his breathing sharp and jerky. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>Loki jerked his head. \u201cWe return.\u201d</p><p>Tagging anyone who interacted with the last chapter &lt;3 <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxL43lMKAZiP1O4tLbBTtzw\">@ebismyname</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIObBAi9fMIdtq8vXHS5Iow\">@ikneelbeforemygod</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVcxTi_wzXtTCRLFA_lunBQ\">@aformingsiren</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxMvChqxOfxjDvNn62lC1yQ\">@workingai</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGc6e-Tj4wz2R6l9GlobvxA\">@ultra-rare-pegacorn</a>, @kit-kat57, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqY3CnJWvepHxgICJY6n1lQ\">@rainbowkitty1220</a>, @kittydogcatfox, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCVJA6NFdKAE-9q3Cs8A0GQ\">@travisliebert</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-SDBIG8rxlhVR071E2vt0g\">@mxvampirepunk</a></p>",

Suddenly he pointed. \u201cThere,\u201d he said, and pulled them through space fifty yards or so down the street.</p><p>Tony coughed. \u201cBit of warning, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you see it?\u201d Loki asked. He pointed towards a man in a suit, the same as every other besuited man on the street, pinstripes and briefcase and mobile phone up by his ear. But instead of the glow in his core, pulsing under the solar plexus, the man had a solid, dull silver tentacle.</p><p>The tip of the tentacle was buried in the man\u2019s head, spreading throughout his brain. From there it sank through his body and down, down into the earth where it disappeared into the darkness. Tony cleared his throat. \u201cWell. Yeah. That\u2019s, uh\u2026 disgusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it killing him?\u201d Peter asked, eyes wide as he watched the man pause on a street corner to snap into the phone.</p><p>\u201cHe is long dead,\u201d Loki said. \u201cHe is but a puppet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026 we can\u2019t save him,\u201d Peter said, and Tony wanted to hug the kid. At least he knew even if Tony himself became evil, Pete would still want to help him.</p><p>Yeah, better not encourage such levels of idealism, really.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do, then?\u201d Tony asked.</p><p>\u201cFollow him down,\u201d said Loki, and rushed forwards, a swirl of ravens cawing as his spirit split into thousands of the birds.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Tony muttered, racing after him. Peter shot out a strand of his own Spectral spirit that wrapped itself around the wildly thrashing puppet. The man started to <i>melt</i>, the tendril retracting into the earth and leaving the body behind, folding itself up on the floor like a rubber suit.</p><p>Before Tony could retch, or react in any way, he felt strong arms snatching him up from the cloud of ravens, and the three of them rushed through the body, through the earth, following the retreating tentacle.</p><p>Tony forced his hysterical mind away from the fact that he\u2019d just dived through a boneless body on the floor and was currently diving into the bowels of the earth after a Hydra. \u201cI\u2019m good under pressure, I\u2019m good under pressure,\u201d he muttered, gritting his teeth and clinging onto Loki.</p><p>They reached a horizontal tunnel at last, and the tentacle whipped away ahead of them as they touched down.

Out of the frying pan, into the fire?\u201d</p><p>Fenrir bounded up in his wolf form, tongue lolling, then, in a swirl of power, switched back to his human form. \u201cAmerica!\u201d he yelled, grabbing her in a hug.</p><p>\u201cFenrir? You\u2019re\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here! We looked for you! Why did you go? I missed you! I told Loki and he said he\u2019d look!

Blood running cold, Tony raced over as fast as he could, Loki splitting into his ravens. At a doorway there stood a black-haired man, his long hair hanging over his face. His nose and mouth were obscured by a jawbone mask, and one arm shimmered, shifting and pulsing with Specral power. \u201cSpeed it up, kids,\u201d Tony yelled, keeping his eyes fixed on the one-armed man.</p><p>For a moment the three of them stared at each other, the noise of fifty three children scrambling to climb onto Jor a panicked rustle behind Tony and Loki. Then the man leaped into action, hurling himself at Tony. Tony shifted, smashing a vial of flame at his feet. The Spectral arm shot out, siphoning up the flames with barely a glance, and the man spun, his flesh arm nearly connecting with Tony\u2019s jaw. Tony raised a hand to block, the strength of the strike vibrating every bone, making him gasp.</p><p>Loki split into ravens and flew at the man, trying to separate him from Tony, but the man kicked out, thumping into Tony\u2019s lower back. Tony dropped to his knee, the adrenaline keeping him from crying out, and swung his arm, knocking the man\u2019s leg out from under him. He fell onto his back, whipped his feet, and flipped himself upright, but Tony had at least managed to scramble backwards, out of the way.</p><p>With a hair-raising scream, Loki dived towards the man, every raven shrieking and coalescing around him. Tony pushed himself to his feet, heart pounding, watching in sickening horror as the ravens whirled around the man in a wild storm. Suddenly there was a rending, ripping noise and the ravens parted, all flying away in unison, looking down, calculating. There on the floor lay the broken man, his shimmering arm gone, his bare face contorted in pain and turned towards Tony.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Tony breathed. \u201cIt\u2019s Bucky fucking Barnes.\u201d</p><p>Loki\u2019s ravens seemed to hang in the air, the world taking in a long breath before the scream, and then, delicate and elegant, dived back down to destroy the most famous missing Monk in history.</p><p>Tony raced forwards, screaming and waving his arms. \u201cLoki, no! It\u2019s Barnes, leave him, no!\u201d</p><p>He bent over Barnes\u2019 body, eyes squeezed shut in terror. The rattle of thousands of feathers and wings trying to change direction filled every sense, and he threw his arms up over his head even as he hunched over Barnes\u2019 chest and face. There was a storm of buffeting wind, of beating wings, a brush of feathers, and nothing. Tony squeezed his eyes open.</p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d Loki said, panting and standing over Tony with dark, angry eyes. \u201cYou are a fucking idiot.\u201d</p><p>Tony burst out laughing, high and terrified. \u201cShit, I know, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is the meaning of this?\u201d Loki snapped.</p><p>Tony looked back down at the man beneath him. \u201cWhen I was a kid, Barnes was this\u2026 legend. A Monk who went missing during the final battle of the great Monk-Spectre war, no trace of him whatsoever. Everyone thought he was vaporised, him and Captain America, but\u2026\u201d He breathed out hard. \u201cI grew up with pictures of him and his team all over the house.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cMy dad worked with them. Never let me hear the end of it, how I\u2019d never be as good as Barnes, as any of the Howling.\u201d He smirked up at Loki, cocky. \u201cI got better.\u201d</p><p>Loki raised an eyebrow and smiled back. \u201cYou did.\u201d He bent down to lift Barnes, who groaned weakly. \u201cHis soul was entangled with a shard of the Hydra\u2019s,\u201d he said as he straightened.</p><p>\u201cYou mean he was a puppet?\u201d Tony asked, eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Loki said. \u201cMore like\u2026 how Peter is now. Only the Hydra\u2019s power was akin to an infection, at war with him. Mine is given gladly, and will work with Peter. It is his now.\u201d</p><p>Tony looked down at Barnes, his breathing sharp and jerky. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>Loki jerked his head. \u201cWe return.\u201d</p><p>Tagging anyone who interacted with the last chapter &lt;3 <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxL43lMKAZiP1O4tLbBTtzw\">@ebismyname</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIObBAi9fMIdtq8vXHS5Iow\">@ikneelbeforemygod</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVcxTi_wzXtTCRLFA_lunBQ\">@aformingsiren</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxMvChqxOfxjDvNn62lC1yQ\">@workingai</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGc6e-Tj4wz2R6l9GlobvxA\">@ultra-rare-pegacorn</a>, @kit-kat57, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqY3CnJWvepHxgICJY6n1lQ\">@rainbowkitty1220</a>, @kittydogcatfox, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCVJA6NFdKAE-9q3Cs8A0GQ\">@travisliebert</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-SDBIG8rxlhVR071E2vt0g\">@mxvampirepunk</a></p>",

Possibly? Do I care? No, I do not. This chapter may be a little bit body horror-esque\u2026</b></p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/18710131/chapters/44375614\"><b>Read from the beginning on AO3 if you prefer!</b></a></p><p>\u201cWe must find a puppet,\u201d said Loki, and Tony\u2019s breath was ripped from him again as they teleported, Spectre style into the middle of Wall Street.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Peter gasped, staggering forwards.</p><p>Tony hauled him back up. \u201cPretty damn cool, huh?\u201d he grinned. Peter nodded, his eyes sparkling.</p><p>Loki shook his head. \u201cYou two are the most\u2026 unusual of Monks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormal is boring,\u201d said Tony, waving a hand. \u201cNow, puppets - what are we looking for?\u201d</p><p>Loki waved a hand and the bustling crowd around them went dark. The people continued to walk, unnoticing, but Tony could see right through them to a glow in their core, the world behind them black and featureless.</p><p>\u201cThe Hydra reaches up, its tendrils burrowing into the core of those whose soul is rotting,\u201d said Loki, his voice a deep rumble. \u201cIt feeds, and replaces, and leaves behind a puppet, walking and wielding power, and outwardly indistinguishable from the narcissistic, greedy scum it was before.\u201d</p><p>Tony and Peter exchanged looks. \u201cWell, we\u2019re in the right place in Wall Street, I guess,\u201d Peter shrugged.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Loki was silent, watching. Suddenly he pointed. \u201cThere,\u201d he said, and pulled them through space fifty yards or so down the street.</p><p>Tony coughed. \u201cBit of warning, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you see it?\u201d Loki asked. He pointed towards a man in a suit, the same as every other besuited man on the street, pinstripes and briefcase and mobile phone up by his ear. But instead of the glow in his core, pulsing under the solar plexus, the man had a solid, dull silver tentacle.</p><p>The tip of the tentacle was buried in the man\u2019s head, spreading throughout his brain. From there it sank through his body and down, down into the earth where it disappeared into the darkness. Tony cleared his throat. \u201cWell. Yeah. That\u2019s, uh\u2026 disgusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it killing him?\u201d Peter asked, eyes wide as he watched the man pause on a street corner to snap into the phone.</p><p>\u201cHe is long dead,\u201d Loki said. \u201cHe is but a puppet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026 we can\u2019t save him,\u201d Peter said, and Tony wanted to hug the kid. At least he knew even if Tony himself became evil, Pete would still want to help him.</p><p>Yeah, better not encourage such levels of idealism, really.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do, then?\u201d Tony asked.</p><p>\u201cFollow him down,\u201d said Loki, and rushed forwards, a swirl of ravens cawing as his spirit split into thousands of the birds.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Tony muttered, racing after him. Peter shot out a strand of his own Spectral spirit that wrapped itself around the wildly thrashing puppet. The man started to <i>melt</i>, the tendril retracting into the earth and leaving the body behind, folding itself up on the floor like a rubber suit.</p><p>Before Tony could retch, or react in any way, he felt strong arms snatching him up from the cloud of ravens, and the three of them rushed through the body, through the earth, following the retreating tentacle.</p><p>Tony forced his hysterical mind away from the fact that he\u2019d just dived through a boneless body on the floor and was currently diving into the bowels of the earth after a Hydra. \u201cI\u2019m good under pressure, I\u2019m good under pressure,\u201d he muttered, gritting his teeth and clinging onto Loki.</p><p>They reached a horizontal tunnel at last, and the tentacle whipped away ahead of them as they touched down. Loki\u2019s ravens coalesced back into his human form, Peter\u2019s Spectre strand tugged back into his hand, and the three of them looked at each other, breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cYou have been here before, Peter,\u201d said Loki. \u201cCan you tell the best direction?\u201d</p><p>Peter looked slightly panicked, then frowned. \u201cYeah, actually. That way.\u201d He pointed straight into a wall.</p><p>Tony\u2019s eyebrows raised. \u201cGood thing I brought blasting powder.\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head. \u201cNo, no, we can just walk through,\u201d he said. \u201cC\u2019mon, I can hear them!\u201d</p><p>Tony frowned and looked around, hearing nothing but silence. Loki shrugged. \u201cI do not hear it either.\u201d</p><p>Peter led them into the wall, pressing into the spongy loam which parted as he moved, and then closed again behind them. Tony shuddered. \u201cUh, this would be a bad time to tell you that I\u2019m a bit claustrophobic, yeah?\u201d</p><p>Loki turned to smirk at him, but he felt a long-fingered hand tuck into his own. He considered feeling insulted, but it felt too nice. He slipped his own fingers between Loki\u2019s and grinned up at him.</p><p>They walked in silence for time that Tony didn\u2019t even bother trying to measure. ADHD always turned that into a bitch anyway, wasn\u2019t much point when he couldn\u2019t see clocks or the sun. He just followed Peter as he turned and pushed on, and when they pushed into a vast cavern, he blinked, like he\u2019d forgotten that\u2019s what space looked like.</p><p>Peter gasped and ran across the room. \u201cTeddy, Kate - you guys OK?\u201d</p><p>Tony and Loki followed him over, Tony casting a ball of magelight which he threw up into the air to cast a golden glow over the room full of\u2026 \u201cJesus Christ,\u201d he muttered. \u201cHow many kids are stuck down here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifty three,\u201d said a skinny boy with huge eyes. \u201cWe count off every evening.\u201d</p><p>Peter was bustling between the bundles of rags and slow-moving limbs, squeezing shoulders, pulling kids into a sitting position, touching faces. Tony reached down to the boy who\u2019d spoken. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid,\u201d he said, taking his hand and hauling himself up, but looking at Tony only out of the corner of his eye.</p><p>\u201cCan everyone walk? Does anyone need carrying out of here?\u201d</p><p>David snorted. \u201cYeah, don\u2019t give us false hope, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe got down here, we\u2019re getting you all back up,\u201d Tony said, still looking around and planning.</p><p>\u201cThe one-armed man\u2019ll be back soon,\u201d said a tough-looking girl, pushing herself to her feet. \u201cYou got no chance. Welcome to hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we shall need help,\u201d Loki said thoughtfully. He tipped his head back and whistled, shrill enough that Tony ducked and clapped his hands over his ears.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Lokes? You want to call the Hydra down on our ears?\u201d</p><p>Loki smirked at him. A white cloud appeared behind his back, particles of light swirling around and coalescing into three distinct shapes. Tony sighed. \u201cHey triplets.\u201d</p><p>Hela smiled, the ragged gash in her skin shifting over her face and leaving the grin on her eyes alone. Jormungandr, in human form, looked around at the room full of ragged children, then shifted into a massive dragon, making a couple of smaller kids scream.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, he\u2019s a friend!\u201d Peter yelled. \u201cUh, Mr Loki, do you think\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cClimb onto Jormungandr\u2019s back,\u201d Loki said. \u201cWe will help you if you cannot, and he will fly you to your freedom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t be real,\u201d said an auburn haired boy weakly, leaning on a big blond guy who wrapped his arms protectively around his shoulders. \u201cThis can\u2019t\u2026 it\u2019s a dream.\u201d He pressed his face into the blond\u2019s chest, exhausted.</p><p>\u201cI told you I\u2019d come back, Billy,\u201d said Peter gently. He glanced up at blondie. \u201cTeddy, can you get him up onto Jor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this for real, Pete?\u201d Teddy asked, frowning. \u201cThe one-armed man took you, we thought you\u2019d be torn apart like\u2026 like all the others and then\u2026 now you\u2019re back here?\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded. \u201cYou know I said I\u2019m an apprentice Monk? This is my master, Tony. He got Loki to help find me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s a Spectre,\u201d said the tough girl. \u201cMonks don\u2019t work with Spectres.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmerica,\u201d Teddy warned.</p><p>\u201cNah, Ted, we can\u2019t trust these guys - we were all grabbed by a Spectre, we\u2019ve been held here for weeks by one massive Spectre that seems to spread across the whole earth, I\u2019m not going with another one. Out of the frying pan, into the fire?\u201d</p><p>Fenrir bounded up in his wolf form, tongue lolling, then, in a swirl of power, switched back to his human form. \u201cAmerica!\u201d he yelled, grabbing her in a hug.</p><p>\u201cFenrir? You\u2019re\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here! We looked for you! Why did you go? I missed you! I told Loki and he said he\u2019d look! We\u2019re here to get you out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Spectre?\u201d America said, mouth open.</p><p>\u201cYup yup. Wolf form. Spectre. Want a ride? I can run real fast. Where\u2019s Kate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, she\u2019s there\u2026\u201d America pointed at a dark haired girl, who pushed through the group to her side. \u201cYou\u2019re a <i>Spectre?\u201d</i></p><p>Tony looked around the room. Hela was hugging a group of smaller children, and Jormungandr was switching back to his human form to talk to a different group of teenagers. Peter grinned at America. \u201cCan we rescue you now?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, dazed. Fenrir scooped her up into an enthusiastic hug, and she laughed, patting his back before he shifted into a wolf form and raced off. \u201cShit, yeah, let\u2019s do this. Shit. Teddy, we\u2019re getting out of here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJor?\u201d Peter yelled. The giant dragon-snake rematerialised, and this time, the kids were much faster at scrambling up onto his back. Tony helped Teddy lift Billy onto Jor\u2019s back, steadying him until Teddy could wrap him up in his arms again.</p><p>Then there was a scream at the edge of the cavern, and a roaring snarl from Fenrir. Blood running cold, Tony raced over as fast as he could, Loki splitting into his ravens. At a doorway there stood a black-haired man, his long hair hanging over his face. His nose and mouth were obscured by a jawbone mask, and one arm shimmered, shifting and pulsing with Specral power. \u201cSpeed it up, kids,\u201d Tony yelled, keeping his eyes fixed on the one-armed man.</p><p>For a moment the three of them stared at each other, the noise of fifty three children scrambling to climb onto Jor a panicked rustle behind Tony and Loki. Then the man leaped into action, hurling himself at Tony. Tony shifted, smashing a vial of flame at his feet. The Spectral arm shot out, siphoning up the flames with barely a glance, and the man spun, his flesh arm nearly connecting with Tony\u2019s jaw. Tony raised a hand to block, the strength of the strike vibrating every bone, making him gasp.</p><p>Loki split into ravens and flew at the man, trying to separate him from Tony, but the man kicked out, thumping into Tony\u2019s lower back. Tony dropped to his knee, the adrenaline keeping him from crying out, and swung his arm, knocking the man\u2019s leg out from under him. He fell onto his back, whipped his feet, and flipped himself upright, but Tony had at least managed to scramble backwards, out of the way.</p><p>With a hair-raising scream, Loki dived towards the man, every raven shrieking and coalescing around him. Tony pushed himself to his feet, heart pounding, watching in sickening horror as the ravens whirled around the man in a wild storm. Suddenly there was a rending, ripping noise and the ravens parted, all flying away in unison, looking down, calculating. There on the floor lay the broken man, his shimmering arm gone, his bare face contorted in pain and turned towards Tony.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Tony breathed. \u201cIt\u2019s Bucky fucking Barnes.\u201d</p><p>Loki\u2019s ravens seemed to hang in the air, the world taking in a long breath before the scream, and then, delicate and elegant, dived back down to destroy the most famous missing Monk in history.</p><p>Tony raced forwards, screaming and waving his arms. \u201cLoki, no! It\u2019s Barnes, leave him, no!\u201d</p><p>He bent over Barnes\u2019 body, eyes squeezed shut in terror. The rattle of thousands of feathers and wings trying to change direction filled every sense, and he threw his arms up over his head even as he hunched over Barnes\u2019 chest and face. There was a storm of buffeting wind, of beating wings, a brush of feathers, and nothing. Tony squeezed his eyes open.</p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d Loki said, panting and standing over Tony with dark, angry eyes. \u201cYou are a fucking idiot.\u201d</p><p>Tony burst out laughing, high and terrified. \u201cShit, I know, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is the meaning of this?\u201d Loki snapped.</p><p>Tony looked back down at the man beneath him. \u201cWhen I was a kid, Barnes was this\u2026 legend. A Monk who went missing during the final battle of the great Monk-Spectre war, no trace of him whatsoever. Everyone thought he was vaporised, him and Captain America, but\u2026\u201d He breathed out hard. \u201cI grew up with pictures of him and his team all over the house.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cMy dad worked with them.

Peter nodded, his eyes sparkling.</p><p>Loki shook his head. &ldquo;You two are the most&hellip; unusual of Monks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Normal is boring,&rdquo; said Tony, waving a hand. &ldquo;Now, puppets - what are we looking for?&rdquo;</p><p>Loki waved a hand and the bustling crowd around them went dark. The people continued to walk, unnoticing, but Tony could see right through them to a glow in their core, the world behind them black and featureless.</p><p>&ldquo;The Hydra reaches up, its tendrils burrowing into the core of those whose soul is rotting,&rdquo; said Loki, his voice a deep rumble. &ldquo;It feeds, and replaces, and leaves behind a puppet, walking and wielding power, and outwardly indistinguishable from the narcissistic, greedy scum it was before.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony and Peter exchanged looks. &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re in the right place in Wall Street, I guess,&rdquo; Peter shrugged.</p><p>Loki was silent, watching. Suddenly he pointed. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said, and pulled them through space fifty yards or so down the street.</p><p>Tony coughed. &ldquo;Bit of warning, please?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you see it?&rdquo; Loki asked. He pointed towards a man in a suit, the same as every other besuited man on the street, pinstripes and briefcase and mobile phone up by his ear. But instead of the glow in his core, pulsing under the solar plexus, the man had a solid, dull silver tentacle.</p><p>The tip of the tentacle was buried in the man&rsquo;s head, spreading throughout his brain. From there it sank through his body and down, down into the earth where it disappeared into the darkness. Tony cleared his throat. &ldquo;Well. Yeah. That&rsquo;s, uh&hellip; disgusting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is it killing him?&rdquo; Peter asked, eyes wide as he watched the man pause on a street corner to snap into the phone.</p><p>&ldquo;He is long dead,&rdquo; Loki said. &ldquo;He is but a puppet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip; we can&rsquo;t save him,&rdquo; Peter said, and Tony wanted to hug the kid. At least he knew even if Tony himself became evil, Pete would still want to help him.</p><p>Yeah, better not encourage such levels of idealism, really.</p><p>&ldquo;What are we going to do, then?&rdquo; Tony asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Follow him down,&rdquo; said Loki, and rushed forwards, a swirl of ravens cawing as his spirit split into thousands of the birds.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit,&rdquo; Tony muttered, racing after him. Peter shot out a strand of his own Spectral spirit that wrapped itself around the wildly thrashing puppet. The man started to <i>melt</i>, the tendril retracting into the earth and leaving the body behind, folding itself up on the floor like a rubber suit.</p><p>Before Tony could retch, or react in any way, he felt strong arms snatching him up from the cloud of ravens, and the three of them rushed through the body, through the earth, following the retreating tentacle.</p><p>Tony forced his hysterical mind away from the fact that he&rsquo;d just dived through a boneless body on the floor and was currently diving into the bowels of the earth after a Hydra. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m good under pressure, I&rsquo;m good under pressure,&rdquo; he muttered, gritting his teeth and clinging onto Loki.</p><p>They reached a horizontal tunnel at last, and the tentacle whipped away ahead of them as they touched down. Loki&rsquo;s ravens coalesced back into his human form, Peter&rsquo;s Spectre strand tugged back into his hand, and the three of them looked at each other, breathing hard.</p><p>&ldquo;You have been here before, Peter,&rdquo; said Loki. &ldquo;Can you tell the best direction?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter looked slightly panicked, then frowned. &ldquo;Yeah, actually. That way.&rdquo; He pointed straight into a wall.</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s eyebrows raised. &ldquo;Good thing I brought blasting powder.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shook his head. &ldquo;No, no, we can just walk through,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, I can hear them!&rdquo;</p><p>Tony frowned and looked around, hearing nothing but silence. Loki shrugged. &ldquo;I do not hear it either.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter led them into the wall, pressing into the spongy loam which parted as he moved, and then closed again behind them. Tony shuddered. &ldquo;Uh, this would be a bad time to tell you that I&rsquo;m a bit claustrophobic, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>Loki turned to smirk at him, but he felt a long-fingered hand tuck into his own. He considered feeling insulted, but it felt too nice. He slipped his own fingers between Loki&rsquo;s and grinned up at him.</p><p>They walked in silence for time that Tony didn&rsquo;t even bother trying to measure. ADHD always turned that into a bitch anyway, wasn&rsquo;t much point when he couldn&rsquo;t see clocks or the sun. He just followed Peter as he turned and pushed on, and when they pushed into a vast cavern, he blinked, like he&rsquo;d forgotten that&rsquo;s what space looked like.</p><p>Peter gasped and ran across the room. &ldquo;Teddy, Kate - you guys OK?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony and Loki followed him over, Tony casting a ball of magelight which he threw up into the air to cast a golden glow over the room full of&hellip; &ldquo;Jesus Christ,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;How many kids are stuck down here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fifty three,&rdquo; said a skinny boy with huge eyes. &ldquo;We count off every evening.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter was bustling between the bundles of rags and slow-moving limbs, squeezing shoulders, pulling kids into a sitting position, touching faces. Tony reached down to the boy who&rsquo;d spoken. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name, kid?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;David,&rdquo; he said, taking his hand and hauling himself up, but looking at Tony only out of the corner of his eye.</p><p>&ldquo;Can everyone walk? Does anyone need carrying out of here?&rdquo;</p><p>David snorted. &ldquo;Yeah, don&rsquo;t give us false hope, man.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We got down here, we&rsquo;re getting you all back up,&rdquo; Tony said, still looking around and planning.</p><p>&ldquo;The one-armed man&rsquo;ll be back soon,&rdquo; said a tough-looking girl, pushing herself to her feet. &ldquo;You got no chance. Welcome to hell.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then we shall need help,&rdquo; Loki said thoughtfully. He tipped his head back and whistled, shrill enough that Tony ducked and clapped his hands over his ears.</p><p>&ldquo;What the hell, Lokes? You want to call the Hydra down on our ears?&rdquo;</p><p>Loki smirked at him. A white cloud appeared behind his back, particles of light swirling around and coalescing into three distinct shapes. Tony sighed. &ldquo;Hey triplets.&rdquo;</p><p>Hela smiled, the ragged gash in her skin shifting over her face and leaving the grin on her eyes alone. Jormungandr, in human form, looked around at the room full of ragged children, then shifted into a massive dragon, making a couple of smaller kids scream.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, he&rsquo;s a friend!&rdquo; Peter yelled. &ldquo;Uh, Mr Loki, do you think&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Climb onto Jormungandr&rsquo;s back,&rdquo; Loki said. &ldquo;We will help you if you cannot, and he will fly you to your freedom.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This can&rsquo;t be real,&rdquo; said an auburn haired boy weakly, leaning on a big blond guy who wrapped his arms protectively around his shoulders. &ldquo;This can&rsquo;t&hellip; it&rsquo;s a dream.&rdquo; He pressed his face into the blond&rsquo;s chest, exhausted.</p><p>&ldquo;I told you I&rsquo;d come back, Billy,&rdquo; said Peter gently. He glanced up at blondie. &ldquo;Teddy, can you get him up onto Jor?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is this for real, Pete?&rdquo; Teddy asked, frowning. &ldquo;The one-armed man took you, we thought you&rsquo;d be torn apart like&hellip; like all the others and then&hellip; now you&rsquo;re back here?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nodded. &ldquo;You know I said I&rsquo;m an apprentice Monk? This is my master, Tony. He got Loki to help find me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s a Spectre,&rdquo; said the tough girl. &ldquo;Monks don&rsquo;t work with Spectres.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;America,&rdquo; Teddy warned.</p><p>&ldquo;Nah, Ted, we can&rsquo;t trust these guys - we were all grabbed by a Spectre, we&rsquo;ve been held here for weeks by one massive Spectre that seems to spread across the whole earth, I&rsquo;m not going with another one. Out of the frying pan, into the fire?&rdquo;</p><p>Fenrir bounded up in his wolf form, tongue lolling, then, in a swirl of power, switched back to his human form. &ldquo;America!&rdquo; he yelled, grabbing her in a hug.</p><p>&ldquo;Fenrir? You&rsquo;re&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re here! We looked for you! Why did you go? I missed you! I told Loki and he said he&rsquo;d look! We&rsquo;re here to get you out!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a Spectre?&rdquo; America said, mouth open.</p><p>&ldquo;Yup yup. Wolf form. Spectre. Want a ride? I can run real fast. Where&rsquo;s Kate?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, she&rsquo;s there&hellip;&rdquo; America pointed at a dark haired girl, who pushed through the group to her side. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a <i>Spectre?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Tony looked around the room. Hela was hugging a group of smaller children, and Jormungandr was switching back to his human form to talk to a different group of teenagers. Peter grinned at America. &ldquo;Can we rescue you now?&rdquo;</p><p>She nodded, dazed. Fenrir scooped her up into an enthusiastic hug, and she laughed, patting his back before he shifted into a wolf form and raced off. &ldquo;Shit, yeah, let&rsquo;s do this. Shit. Teddy, we&rsquo;re getting out of here!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jor?&rdquo; Peter yelled. The giant dragon-snake rematerialised, and this time, the kids were much faster at scrambling up onto his back. Tony helped Teddy lift Billy onto Jor&rsquo;s back, steadying him until Teddy could wrap him up in his arms again.</p><p>Then there was a scream at the edge of the cavern, and a roaring snarl from Fenrir. Blood running cold, Tony raced over as fast as he could, Loki splitting into his ravens. At a doorway there stood a black-haired man, his long hair hanging over his face. His nose and mouth were obscured by a jawbone mask, and one arm shimmered, shifting and pulsing with Specral power. &ldquo;Speed it up, kids,&rdquo; Tony yelled, keeping his eyes fixed on the one-armed man.</p><p>For a moment the three of them stared at each other, the noise of fifty three children scrambling to climb onto Jor a panicked rustle behind Tony and Loki. Then the man leaped into action, hurling himself at Tony. Tony shifted, smashing a vial of flame at his feet. The Spectral arm shot out, siphoning up the flames with barely a glance, and the man spun, his flesh arm nearly connecting with Tony&rsquo;s jaw. Tony raised a hand to block, the strength of the strike vibrating every bone, making him gasp.</p><p>Loki split into ravens and flew at the man, trying to separate him from Tony, but the man kicked out, thumping into Tony&rsquo;s lower back. Tony dropped to his knee, the adrenaline keeping him from crying out, and swung his arm, knocking the man&rsquo;s leg out from under him. He fell onto his back, whipped his feet, and flipped himself upright, but Tony had at least managed to scramble backwards, out of the way.</p><p>With a hair-raising scream, Loki dived towards the man, every raven shrieking and coalescing around him. Tony pushed himself to his feet, heart pounding, watching in sickening horror as the ravens whirled around the man in a wild storm. Suddenly there was a rending, ripping noise and the ravens parted, all flying away in unison, looking down, calculating. There on the floor lay the broken man, his shimmering arm gone, his bare face contorted in pain and turned towards Tony.</p><p>&ldquo;Holy shit,&rdquo; Tony breathed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Bucky fucking Barnes.&rdquo;</p><p>Loki&rsquo;s ravens seemed to hang in the air, the world taking in a long breath before the scream, and then, delicate and elegant, dived back down to destroy the most famous missing Monk in history.</p><p>Tony raced forwards, screaming and waving his arms. &ldquo;Loki, no! It&rsquo;s Barnes, leave him, no!&rdquo;</p><p>He bent over Barnes&rsquo; body, eyes squeezed shut in terror. The rattle of thousands of feathers and wings trying to change direction filled every sense, and he threw his arms up over his head even as he hunched over Barnes&rsquo; chest and face. There was a storm of buffeting wind, of beating wings, a brush of feathers, and nothing. Tony squeezed his eyes open.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony,&rdquo; Loki said, panting and standing over Tony with dark, angry eyes. &ldquo;You are a fucking idiot.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony burst out laughing, high and terrified. &ldquo;Shit, I know, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo; Loki snapped.</p><p>Tony looked back down at the man beneath him. &ldquo;When I was a kid, Barnes was this&hellip; legend. A Monk who went missing during the final battle of the great Monk-Spectre war, no trace of him whatsoever. Everyone thought he was vaporised, him and Captain America, but&hellip;&rdquo; He breathed out hard. &ldquo;I grew up with pictures of him and his team all over the house.&rdquo; He shrugged. &ldquo;My dad worked with them. Never let me hear the end of it, how I&rsquo;d never be as good as Barnes, as any of the Howling.&rdquo; He smirked up at Loki, cocky. &ldquo;I got better.&rdquo;</p><p>Loki raised an eyebrow and smiled back. &ldquo;You did.&rdquo; He bent down to lift Barnes, who groaned weakly. &ldquo;His soul was entangled with a shard of the Hydra&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he said as he straightened.</p><p>&ldquo;You mean he was a puppet?&rdquo; Tony asked, eyes wide.</p><p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Loki said. &ldquo;More like&hellip; how Peter is now. Only the Hydra&rsquo;s power was akin to an infection, at war with him. Mine is given gladly, and will work with Peter. It is his now.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony looked down at Barnes, his breathing sharp and jerky. &ldquo;What now?&rdquo;</p><p>Loki jerked his head. &ldquo;We return.&rdquo;</p><p>Tagging anyone who interacted with the last chapter &lt;3 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxL43lMKAZiP1O4tLbBTtzw\">@ebismyname</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIObBAi9fMIdtq8vXHS5Iow\">@ikneelbeforemygod</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVcxTi_wzXtTCRLFA_lunBQ\">@aformingsiren</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxMvChqxOfxjDvNn62lC1yQ\">@workingai</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGc6e-Tj4wz2R6l9GlobvxA\">@ultra-rare-pegacorn</a>, @kit-kat57, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqY3CnJWvepHxgICJY6n1lQ\">@rainbowkitty1220</a>, @kittydogcatfox, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCVJA6NFdKAE-9q3Cs8A0GQ\">@travisliebert</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-SDBIG8rxlhVR071E2vt0g\">@mxvampirepunk</a></p>",

For some of the smartest, wisest, deadliest, most observant and toughest people in the world, they were utterly oblivious to the struggle in front of their eyes. How could I expect them to save me though when I couldn&rsquo;t even save myself? \u00a0I could feel it coming, the dread, my heart started racing, the walls felt like they were closing in, my breathing ragged, I could feel the heat of my flushed skin creeping up my chest and into my neck. I was no longer paying attention to the conversation going on in the lounge, I tugged at my sweatshirt collar that suddenly felt like it was strangling my airway. I felt sick to my stomach, sweat beading on my forehead, I shot out off the couch like a jackrabbit searching for a place to hide and ride it out. How could I explain this to anyone, they wouldn&rsquo;t understand?</p><p>For a week the panic attacks hit me hard on a daily basis. I hid it from everyone, a week spent getting a closer look around the Compound and all the nooks and crannies to hide in. The dread and the fear, my heart literally skipping beats and stopping before sluggishly ramping up again, shortness of breath, I would have looked an utter wreck if anyone had come upon me. When the panic attacks started I tried breathing into a bag, holding my head between my knees, running around the track to get rid of the incessant feeling to run, aromatherapy junk, I tried it all and it didn&rsquo;t help me. So I&rsquo;d curled up into a tight ball until it&rsquo;d pass, sometimes I&rsquo;d be laying there for an hour before it passed.</p><p>The first time it hit hard, I barely managed to get into my room before the panic got too severe. In my hast, I&rsquo;d knocked over my iPod and its docking station, for an hour it played the same song over and over, I memorized the words, Chasing Cars by Snow Patrol. The next attack, I lay curled up on the floor of a utility closet near the hanger repeating the words to the song. The attack didn&rsquo;t last as long as the others. Every time I felt that sick, stomach tightening feeling of dread, the sweat on my forehead, I&rsquo;d run for cover and ball up muttering the words to the song until it passed. It wasn&rsquo;t perfect but it was better than what it was in the beginning.</p><p>Today was a no good rotten day from the start, the dread and feeling of impending doom clung to me the second I awoke. \u00a0What should have been a quick in and out mission turned into major casualties. It wasn&rsquo;t my fault, we&rsquo;d gotten terrible intel, but it didn&rsquo;t matter, I blamed myself. I paced back and forth in the jet on the way home, anxious for the bay doors to open so I could run. I could feel their eyes on me, Steve, Bucky, Nat, Clint, the faint mumblings wondering if I was alright. I paced back and forth biting my fingernails. The second those doors started to part I was crawling out before they could even finish saying my name.</p><p>I raced across the hangar floor, ignoring the stares, I ran and ran until I found myself in front of Tony&rsquo;s lab. There was a note stuck to the door telling Bruce that Tony&rsquo;d be back in two hours. Good, plenty of time to have my little episode and get out before anyone saw the trembling mess I&rsquo;d become. I felt weak, subhuman like I had a parasite inside me that I couldn&rsquo;t kill, it just kept nagging at my brain finding it funny at my internal torture.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on with her? She&rsquo;s been a little off for a while.&rdquo; Wanda questioned worriedly.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure but when she&rsquo;s ready she&rsquo;ll tell us,&rdquo; Steve spoke.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been going on too long, don&rsquo;t you think she would have said something by now?&rdquo; Bucky pointed out. Tony entered the lounged, staring confused at the impromptu get together as he poured himself a drink.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the haps team? Mission did not go as planned?&rdquo; He chugged his whiskey.</p><p>&ldquo;Not even close, bad intel, a lot of people got hurt,&rdquo; Clint said picking at his bow.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n?&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s eyes on Steve.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s didn&rsquo;t get hurt but somethings going on with her and we don&rsquo;t know what.&rdquo; F.R.I.D.A.Y chimed in interrupting Steve.</p><p>&ldquo;There is a code Stark in your lab sir.&rdquo; Tony tilted his head confused.</p><p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m here, how can there be a code Stark without Stark F.R.I.D.A.Y.? Are you glitching out?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No sir, I am functioning properly, it&rsquo;s Y/n having a code Stark.&rdquo; F.R.I.D.A.Y. stated.</p><p>&ldquo;No one gets within 20 yards of that lab you understand F.R.I.D.A.Y., run Protocol Snow, now!&rdquo; Tony ran out of the lounge and down to his lab, leaving the rest of the team in flustered confusion.</p><p>I lay curled on the floor, mumbling the words of the song, eyes shut, tears pooling down my face, body shaking in tremors. The song started to play softly through the lab, the door creaked opened and closed, I was trying to concentrate on slowing my breathing. I could hear faint footsteps near me and a gasp, arms were wrapped around me and a warm body pressed against me on the cold cement floor, his hand stroking my hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh Kitten,&rdquo; was all he said before he kissed the top of my head. We laid on the floor and he held me tight without speaking.</p><p>&ldquo;Just breath, I&rsquo;ve got you. F.R.I.D.A.Y., lock down the lab.&rdquo; He whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes Sir,&rdquo; answered F.R.I.D.A.Y.</p><p>&ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re going through. You&rsquo;ve hidden it better than I did. Just breathe, not from here,&rdquo; he put his hand lightly on my chest and moved it to my stomach, &ldquo;breath from here. That&rsquo;s it, there ya go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; My breath was still shaky.</p><p>&ldquo;After New York, I was a total wreck, wouldn&rsquo;t leave my room for days on end, drank myself into a drunken mess. The Ultron debacle didn&rsquo;t help either it got worse, then the Accords and Team Cap, finding out about my parents and Bucky. I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ll ever be alright.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you cope?&rdquo; My breathing finally steady, the sickly feeling disappearing, I no longer felt like I was drowning in my own failures.</p><p>&ldquo;I keep myself busy, too busy to think about anything. There&rsquo;s always something to do, something to improve. The only time it gets really bad is when I&rsquo;m trying to sleep. It&rsquo;s the only time I can&rsquo;t quiet my mind and the thoughts running through it. Eventually, total exhaustion wins and I pass out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s terrible, I thought I was bad for hiding, at least I can sleep.&rdquo; I cupped his hand still on my stomach and laced my fingers with his, I could feel the hot breath from his sigh on my head.</p><p>&ldquo;It gets better in the morning when I get to see your smile.&rdquo; A soft chuckle rumbled through his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;I hate to break it too you but I&rsquo;ve been faking those smiles,&rdquo; I sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;Not this smile. It&rsquo;s the &lsquo;first sip of coffee, I&rsquo;m determined my day will be better&rsquo; smile.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re never awake that early, how do you know that smile,&rdquo; a soft laugh escaped my lips.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen it,&rdquo; his voice deep and serious.</p><p>&ldquo;How did you know to play that song, Tony?&rdquo; I could feel his chest heave that giant sigh through my back.</p><p>&ldquo;F.R.I.D.A.Y. alerted me the first night it happened. I saw it up on my screen over there,&rdquo; he pointed to a lab table, &ldquo;it broke me seeing you go through something like that. I started Protocol Snow,&rdquo; his voice nervous.</p><p>&ldquo;Protocol Snow?&rdquo; I whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;Not my best idea I suppose. The song, I had it softly piped into any room you were in to help you through it. I should have just found you and done this,&rdquo; hugging me tighter, &ldquo;but I know my reputation. I was afraid you&rsquo;d think I was trying to take advantage of you. I regret letting you suffer alone for so long. I know better than anyone the anguish of suffering alone, just wanting someone to grip you tight to bring you back to the here and now. A heartbeat to focus on other than the rapid pace of your own. I&rsquo;m guessing you think I&rsquo;m kinda creepy right now huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not totally,&rdquo; I lightly elbowed his stomach. &ldquo;My brain is still trying to figure out how you know my morning smile when you&rsquo;re not out of bed before 11 a.m.&rdquo; He sighed and pulled away sitting up behind me.</p><p>&ldquo;F.R.I.D.A.Y. reset my alarm to go off in one minute and put it on my workbench screen, please. Look, I&rsquo;m not gonna lie, I&rsquo;ve got a soft spot for you Y/n, have since you joined the team and now is not the time to be saying this to you, but you have to understand what you&rsquo;re about to see. I look at that every morning, every time I get up and I think to myself, 'if she can make it through another day so can I. If she can face the world as much as she wants to hide from it, then I can get my sorry ass out of bed.&rsquo; All you&rsquo;ve been through your entire life even before the panic attacks started, everything trying to knock you down, keep you down, and you keep pulling yourself up fighting back. These panic episodes, they&rsquo;re not a weakness so get that out of your head right now, it&rsquo;s just another obstacle to kick in the ass, and when you do, you&rsquo;ll come out shining like the angel I see inside.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony&hellip;I.&rdquo; The alarm went off playing my song, a video flashed on the screen of me sitting at the kitchen table surrounded by the team, steaming hot cup of coffee in my hand, hair in a messy bun, sweater hanging off my shoulder exposing the bare skin and the sleep tank-top beneath. I gasp staring at the screen, sitting up, my hands covering my mouth. I see myself on the video breathe in the smell of the coffee, a small smirk creeps across my face as I take my first sip. My eyes close as I savor the flavor, it&rsquo;s life-giving energy flowing through my system, my smile widens. Someone must have told a joke or said something funny, my eyes open, head tilts back and I let out a laugh, a real laugh I haven&rsquo;t heard come out of my own mouth in some time. The smile on my face genuine and real, the crinkles around my eyes give it away. I stare off into space smiling, the video makes it look as if I&rsquo;m staring right at myself. A sparkle in my eyes, a massive grin on my face as if I&rsquo;m staring at something I adore. The video pauses and all you can see is me, smiling.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean this to be all creepy stalker-like, I never meant it like that, but when Happy pointed this out on that on the security feed he was reviewing, I found inspiration in it. You were braver than I ever could be, and I wanted to be able to cope with my own shit like you. To get up and face the world even though I felt like I was dying inside.&rdquo; I wasn&rsquo;t moving or talking just staring at the screen, my eyes scrunched up in confusion. &ldquo;Maybe I should go,&rdquo; he said as he stood up to walk out, I jumped up after him.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, Tony,&rdquo; I grabbed his hand pulling him back towards me. He stood staring in my eyes, his own flashing regret, and shame, a tinge of hope. I rushed into him wrapping my arms around him, my head resting on his shoulder, he tensed at the sudden movement before his own arms snaked around me. &ldquo;Thank you, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s creepy, it&rsquo;s kinda sweet actually.&rdquo; I held onto to him tightly not wanting to let go, but he coughed nervously, stepped back and smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Go on Kitten, go relax, I&rsquo;ll see you at dinner?&rdquo; He tried shooing me out of his lab.</p><p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t miss it, save you a seat?&rdquo; I smirked.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hold you to it.&rdquo; His eyes saying something different than his smile.</p><p>I took a nice long hot shower while thinking of that video. I was an inspiration for the Great Tony Stark, I couldn&rsquo;t wrap my head around it. He always seemed so together, so calm, but all these years he was losing his shit mentally in silence. It didn&rsquo;t seem fair, he&rsquo;d done so much for others but never said a thing, never once complained, he acted just like me. Hid away and suffered in silence, he deserved better than that.</p><p>Dinner rolled around, I saved him a seat next to me but he never showed. I ate dinner in silence listening to the conversations around me, wondering in my head whether he was alright. Maybe he lost track of time in his lab like he usually does. I went to the kitchen and made him up a plate, knabbing some silverware and a beer out of the fridge and headed down to the lab, only to find it empty.</p><p>&ldquo;F.R.I.D.A.Y. could you please locate Tony for me?&rdquo; I croaked worried.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in his bungalow, Miss.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Miss?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes F.R.I.D.A.Y.?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I would hurry if I were you,&rdquo; was all the A.I. said.</p><p>I hightailed it out of the building and across the lawn to Tony&rsquo;s private bungalow. His escapades with the ladies had gotten him in trouble over the years, some of them just used him to get onto the Compound to chase after the likes of Steve or Thor, occasionally Nat to our surprise, so he moved out of the living quarters and into his own little hideaway. Now that I&rsquo;d thought about it, I hadn&rsquo;t seen Tony even glance at another woman in ages. I walked through the doors so silence except for the running water of his shower in the back of the house. I set his dinner on the kitchen counter and wandered towards his bedroom.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony, you okay? You missed dinner,&rdquo; I called out. There was a muffled response I couldn&rsquo;t make out. I walked into his bedroom to see him in the shower fully clothed sitting with his back against the shower wall, knees up to his chest, red puffy dead looking eyes, soaked to the bone, cold water running on him.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony!&rdquo; I screamed rushing to turn the water off, I dropped to my knees, water splashing everywhere, pulled him into me, his head resting on my chest, a hand clawing onto my arm holding tight. &ldquo;F.R.I.D.A.Y. Protocol Snow, lock down the bungalow, no interruptions.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony you&rsquo;re freezing, come on, let me help you up, you can&rsquo;t stay in these wet clothes, you&rsquo;ll get sick.&rdquo; He let me help him up, his body swayed like he was drunk, he blinked slowly, I could feel his heart beat like a crazed drummer during a solo as I unbuttoned his shirt. His chest heaving raggedly breathing as if he was choking. His own panic attack, just as severe as my own. \u00a0I slipped off his jeans, wrapping his naked body in a big fluffy towel, he didn&rsquo;t even have it in him to crack a joke about being nude. His eyes flickering all over the room until they found mine. He stayed glued to my face as I dried him off, dragging him into his bedroom. There was a robe laid across a chair that I slipped over him, tying it at the waist. I nudged him gently towards the bed pulling back the covers making him lay down.</p><p>&ldquo;You need to warm up. F.R.I.D.A.Y. turn the fireplace on and turn the song up a little please.&rdquo;</p><p>I sat next to Tony leaning on the headboard, without nudging or asking he laid his head on my chest and wrapped his arms around me. I pulled the covers up and around us and ran my fingers through his hair. I was doing my best to control my own breathing, tried to focus on deep breaths like he&rsquo;d done for me earlier. I traced patterns onto his back and started to sing the words to the song. My shirt damp with tears that silently fled his eyes, I leaned down and kissed the top of his head.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright, you don&rsquo;t have to say anything. It&rsquo;s about time for someone to share that weight. Nothing leaves this place, in this bed, in these arms, you&rsquo;re not Iron Man or the Billionaire playboy, you&rsquo;re just Tony, nothing more nothing less. You move or talk whenever you&rsquo;re ready, I&rsquo;m not going anywhere.&rdquo; I could feel his head nod as I stroked his hair. &ldquo;Would it bother you if I talked?&rdquo; He shook his head no, now I knew what he meant when he told me it broke him to see me in a full blown panic attack, I felt it towards him right now.</p><p>&ldquo;You said something earlier that bothered me, couldn&rsquo;t get it out of my head, a typical woman right?&rdquo; I could feel his forehead scrunch up. &ldquo;You said you had a soft spot for me, now that could mean various things by my thinking. Maybe it means you view me as just a friend, or maybe an annoying little sister or maybe its a long shot though that you uh&hellip;feel something a little deeper.&rdquo; His breathing had slowed, tears stopped flowing, I could see his eyes go wide in emotion I couldn&rsquo;t place. &ldquo;My money, what little I&rsquo;ve got, is on the latter and that would explain why my favorite snacks and alcohol are the only ones ever fully stocked, or why my shower seems to have an endless supply of hot water, or why my battle uniform is suddenly made out of some new fangled kevlar that quite literally saved my ass earlier today. This isn&rsquo;t the time to really have this conversation like you stated earlier, but we will at sometime soon revisit this.&rdquo; I hugged him tightly, kissing the top of his head again. He smelled like sage, musk, cedar, and hint of lavender, I internally laughed almost thinking he&rsquo;d smell of WD-40, Vibrainium and blow torch fumes.</p><p>&ldquo;It sucks to feel like this, I thought it was better to keep it all inside because I&rsquo;d rather the pain destroy me than everyone else around me, but it took until you today to get me to realize that I wasn&rsquo;t protecting anyone from my pain, I hurt someone very dear to me. My Grandmother used to say, 'if you can&rsquo;t get someone off your mind; it&rsquo;s because your mind always knows what your heart is thinking.&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a day that&rsquo;s gone by that he hasn&rsquo;t been on my mind, but that&rsquo;s for another day I suppose.&rdquo;</p><p>We laid in silence for hours after that, falling asleep clutching on tightly to each other. It was the first restful nights&rsquo; sleep in a while. The light from sunrise gleamed through the bedroom window straight into my eyes waking me from a pleasant dream. \u00a0 My eyes groggily opened to see the fireplace still going, the music still playing, I was spooning Tony who laid in front of me. My right arm numb from his weight sleeping on it all night, I tried to move my arm from beneath him without waking him up. I felt his fingers intertwine in my left hand, he brought it to his lips, kissing my knuckles.</p><p>&ldquo;Mornin&rsquo; Angel.&rdquo; He groaned moving slightly so I could take back my numb and momentarily useless arm, he landed on his back, eyes watching intently as I sat up and rubbed the life back into my arm.</p><p>&ldquo;DIdn&rsquo;t mean to wake you,&rdquo; I smiled sheepishly.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been awake for a while, I didn&rsquo;t want to move if I&rsquo;m being fully honest. By the way, do you know you snore? I mean it&rsquo;s so soft that it&rsquo;s kind of cute but still you snore,&rdquo; the way he laughed made his eyes lit up, a big difference than how they looked when I found him last night.</p><p>&ldquo;I do not!&rdquo; Playfully slapping his arm, &ldquo;whatever, you talk in your sleep.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mhm, did I say anything incriminating?&rdquo; An eye quirked upward.</p><p>&ldquo;Just that you love me and you were trying to fight the Galaxy to prove it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sounds about right. Dinner tonight?&rdquo; He smirked. &ldquo;Just me and you.

For some of the smartest, wisest, deadliest, most observant and toughest people in the world, they were utterly oblivious to the struggle in front of their eyes. How could I expect them to save me though when I couldn\u2019t even save myself? \u00a0I could feel it coming, the dread, my heart started racing, the walls felt like they were closing in, my breathing ragged, I could feel the heat of my flushed skin creeping up my chest and into my neck. I was no longer paying attention to the conversation going on in the lounge, I tugged at my sweatshirt collar that suddenly felt like it was strangling my airway. I felt sick to my stomach, sweat beading on my forehead, I shot out off the couch like a jackrabbit searching for a place to hide and ride it out. How could I explain this to anyone, they wouldn\u2019t understand?</p><p>For a week the panic attacks hit me hard on a daily basis. I hid it from everyone, a week spent getting a closer look around the Compound and all the nooks and crannies to hide in. The dread and the fear, my heart literally skipping beats and stopping before sluggishly ramping up again, shortness of breath, I would have looked an utter wreck if anyone had come upon me. When the panic attacks started I tried breathing into a bag, holding my head between my knees, running around the track to get rid of the incessant feeling to run, aromatherapy junk, I tried it all and it didn\u2019t help me. So I\u2019d curled up into a tight ball until it\u2019d pass, sometimes I\u2019d be laying there for an hour before it passed.</p><p>The first time it hit hard, I barely managed to get into my room before the panic got too severe. In my hast, I\u2019d knocked over my iPod and its docking station, for an hour it played the same song over and over, I memorized the words, Chasing Cars by Snow Patrol. The next attack, I lay curled up on the floor of a utility closet near the hanger repeating the words to the song. The attack didn\u2019t last as long as the others. Every time I felt that sick, stomach tightening feeling of dread, the sweat on my forehead, I\u2019d run for cover and ball up muttering the words to the song until it passed. It wasn\u2019t perfect but it was better than what it was in the beginning.</p><p>Today was a no good rotten day from the start, the dread and feeling of impending doom clung to me the second I awoke. \u00a0What should have been a quick in and out mission turned into major casualties. It wasn\u2019t my fault, we\u2019d gotten terrible intel, but it didn\u2019t matter, I blamed myself. I paced back and forth in the jet on the way home, anxious for the bay doors to open so I could run. I could feel their eyes on me, Steve, Bucky, Nat, Clint, the faint mumblings wondering if I was alright. I paced back and forth biting my fingernails. The second those doors started to part I was crawling out before they could even finish saying my name.</p><p>I raced across the hangar floor, ignoring the stares, I ran and ran until I found myself in front of Tony\u2019s lab. There was a note stuck to the door telling Bruce that Tony\u2019d be back in two hours. Good, plenty of time to have my little episode and get out before anyone saw the trembling mess I\u2019d become. I felt weak, subhuman like I had a parasite inside me that I couldn\u2019t kill, it just kept nagging at my brain finding it funny at my internal torture.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with her? She\u2019s been a little off for a while.\u201d Wanda questioned worriedly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure but when she\u2019s ready she\u2019ll tell us,\u201d Steve spoke.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been going on too long, don\u2019t you think she would have said something by now?\u201d Bucky pointed out. Tony entered the lounged, staring confused at the impromptu get together as he poured himself a drink.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the haps team? Mission did not go as planned?\u201d He chugged his whiskey.</p><p>\u201cNot even close, bad intel, a lot of people got hurt,\u201d Clint said picking at his bow.</p><p>\u201cY/n?\u201d Tony\u2019s eyes on Steve.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s didn\u2019t get hurt but somethings going on with her and we don\u2019t know what.\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y chimed in interrupting Steve.</p><p>\u201cThere is a code Stark in your lab sir.\u201d Tony tilted his head confused.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m here, how can there be a code Stark without Stark F.R.I.D.A.Y.? Are you glitching out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo sir, I am functioning properly, it\u2019s Y/n having a code Stark.\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y. stated.</p><p>\u201cNo one gets within 20 yards of that lab you understand F.R.I.D.A.Y., run Protocol Snow, now!\u201d Tony ran out of the lounge and down to his lab, leaving the rest of the team in flustered confusion.</p><p>I lay curled on the floor, mumbling the words of the song, eyes shut, tears pooling down my face, body shaking in tremors. The song started to play softly through the lab, the door creaked opened and closed, I was trying to concentrate on slowing my breathing. I could hear faint footsteps near me and a gasp, arms were wrapped around me and a warm body pressed against me on the cold cement floor, his hand stroking my hair.</p><p>\u201cOh Kitten,\u201d was all he said before he kissed the top of my head. We laid on the floor and he held me tight without speaking.</p><p>\u201cJust breath, I\u2019ve got you. F.R.I.D.A.Y., lock down the lab.\u201d He whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes Sir,\u201d answered F.R.I.D.A.Y.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re going through. You\u2019ve hidden it better than I did. Just breathe, not from here,\u201d he put his hand lightly on my chest and moved it to my stomach, \u201cbreath from here. That\u2019s it, there ya go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d My breath was still shaky.</p><p>\u201cAfter New York, I was a total wreck, wouldn\u2019t leave my room for days on end, drank myself into a drunken mess. The Ultron debacle didn\u2019t help either it got worse, then the Accords and Team Cap, finding out about my parents and Bucky. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever be alright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you cope?\u201d My breathing finally steady, the sickly feeling disappearing, I no longer felt like I was drowning in my own failures.</p><p>\u201cI keep myself busy, too busy to think about anything. There\u2019s always something to do, something to improve. The only time it gets really bad is when I\u2019m trying to sleep. It\u2019s the only time I can\u2019t quiet my mind and the thoughts running through it. Eventually, total exhaustion wins and I pass out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s terrible, I thought I was bad for hiding, at least I can sleep.\u201d I cupped his hand still on my stomach and laced my fingers with his, I could feel the hot breath from his sigh on my head.</p><p>\u201cIt gets better in the morning when I get to see your smile.\u201d A soft chuckle rumbled through his chest.</p><p>\u201cI hate to break it too you but I\u2019ve been faking those smiles,\u201d I sighed.</p><p>\u201cNot this smile. It\u2019s the \u2018first sip of coffee, I\u2019m determined my day will be better\u2019 smile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re never awake that early, how do you know that smile,\u201d a soft laugh escaped my lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen it,\u201d his voice deep and serious.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know to play that song, Tony?\u201d I could feel his chest heave that giant sigh through my back.</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y. alerted me the first night it happened. I saw it up on my screen over there,\u201d he pointed to a lab table, \u201cit broke me seeing you go through something like that. I started Protocol Snow,\u201d his voice nervous.</p><p>\u201cProtocol Snow?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cNot my best idea I suppose. The song, I had it softly piped into any room you were in to help you through it. I should have just found you and done this,\u201d hugging me tighter, \u201cbut I know my reputation. I was afraid you\u2019d think I was trying to take advantage of you. I regret letting you suffer alone for so long. I know better than anyone the anguish of suffering alone, just wanting someone to grip you tight to bring you back to the here and now. A heartbeat to focus on other than the rapid pace of your own. I\u2019m guessing you think I\u2019m kinda creepy right now huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot totally,\u201d I lightly elbowed his stomach. \u201cMy brain is still trying to figure out how you know my morning smile when you\u2019re not out of bed before 11 a.m.\u201d He sighed and pulled away sitting up behind me.</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y. reset my alarm to go off in one minute and put it on my workbench screen, please. Look, I\u2019m not gonna lie, I\u2019ve got a soft spot for you Y/n, have since you joined the team and now is not the time to be saying this to you, but you have to understand what you\u2019re about to see. I look at that every morning, every time I get up and I think to myself, 'if she can make it through another day so can I. If she can face the world as much as she wants to hide from it, then I can get my sorry ass out of bed.\u2019 All you\u2019ve been through your entire life even before the panic attacks started, everything trying to knock you down, keep you down, and you keep pulling yourself up fighting back. These panic episodes, they\u2019re not a weakness so get that out of your head right now, it\u2019s just another obstacle to kick in the ass, and when you do, you\u2019ll come out shining like the angel I see inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony\u2026I.\u201d The alarm went off playing my song, a video flashed on the screen of me sitting at the kitchen table surrounded by the team, steaming hot cup of coffee in my hand, hair in a messy bun, sweater hanging off my shoulder exposing the bare skin and the sleep tank-top beneath. I gasp staring at the screen, sitting up, my hands covering my mouth. I see myself on the video breathe in the smell of the coffee, a small smirk creeps across my face as I take my first sip. My eyes close as I savor the flavor, it\u2019s life-giving energy flowing through my system, my smile widens. Someone must have told a joke or said something funny, my eyes open, head tilts back and I let out a laugh, a real laugh I haven\u2019t heard come out of my own mouth in some time. The smile on my face genuine and real, the crinkles around my eyes give it away. I stare off into space smiling, the video makes it look as if I\u2019m staring right at myself. A sparkle in my eyes, a massive grin on my face as if I\u2019m staring at something I adore. The video pauses and all you can see is me, smiling.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean this to be all creepy stalker-like, I never meant it like that, but when Happy pointed this out on that on the security feed he was reviewing, I found inspiration in it. You were braver than I ever could be, and I wanted to be able to cope with my own shit like you. To get up and face the world even though I felt like I was dying inside.\u201d I wasn\u2019t moving or talking just staring at the screen, my eyes scrunched up in confusion. \u201cMaybe I should go,\u201d he said as he stood up to walk out, I jumped up after him.</p><p>\u201cWait, Tony,\u201d I grabbed his hand pulling him back towards me. He stood staring in my eyes, his own flashing regret, and shame, a tinge of hope. I rushed into him wrapping my arms around him, my head resting on his shoulder, he tensed at the sudden movement before his own arms snaked around me. \u201cThank you, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s creepy, it\u2019s kinda sweet actually.\u201d I held onto to him tightly not wanting to let go, but he coughed nervously, stepped back and smiled.</p><p>\u201cGo on Kitten, go relax, I\u2019ll see you at dinner?\u201d He tried shooing me out of his lab.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t miss it, save you a seat?\u201d I smirked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hold you to it.\u201d His eyes saying something different than his smile.</p><p>I took a nice long hot shower while thinking of that video. I was an inspiration for the Great Tony Stark, I couldn\u2019t wrap my head around it. He always seemed so together, so calm, but all these years he was losing his shit mentally in silence. It didn\u2019t seem fair, he\u2019d done so much for others but never said a thing, never once complained, he acted just like me. Hid away and suffered in silence, he deserved better than that.</p><p>Dinner rolled around, I saved him a seat next to me but he never showed. I ate dinner in silence listening to the conversations around me, wondering in my head whether he was alright. Maybe he lost track of time in his lab like he usually does. I went to the kitchen and made him up a plate, knabbing some silverware and a beer out of the fridge and headed down to the lab, only to find it empty.</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y. could you please locate Tony for me?\u201d I croaked worried.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in his bungalow, Miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes F.R.I.D.A.Y.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would hurry if I were you,\u201d was all the A.I. said.</p><p>I hightailed it out of the building and across the lawn to Tony\u2019s private bungalow. His escapades with the ladies had gotten him in trouble over the years, some of them just used him to get onto the Compound to chase after the likes of Steve or Thor, occasionally Nat to our surprise, so he moved out of the living quarters and into his own little hideaway. Now that I\u2019d thought about it, I hadn\u2019t seen Tony even glance at another woman in ages. I walked through the doors so silence except for the running water of his shower in the back of the house. I set his dinner on the kitchen counter and wandered towards his bedroom.</p><p>\u201cTony, you okay? You missed dinner,\u201d I called out. There was a muffled response I couldn\u2019t make out. I walked into his bedroom to see him in the shower fully clothed sitting with his back against the shower wall, knees up to his chest, red puffy dead looking eyes, soaked to the bone, cold water running on him.</p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d I screamed rushing to turn the water off, I dropped to my knees, water splashing everywhere, pulled him into me, his head resting on my chest, a hand clawing onto my arm holding tight. \u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y. Protocol Snow, lock down the bungalow, no interruptions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony you\u2019re freezing, come on, let me help you up, you can\u2019t stay in these wet clothes, you\u2019ll get sick.\u201d He let me help him up, his body swayed like he was drunk, he blinked slowly, I could feel his heart beat like a crazed drummer during a solo as I unbuttoned his shirt. His chest heaving raggedly breathing as if he was choking. His own panic attack, just as severe as my own. \u00a0I slipped off his jeans, wrapping his naked body in a big fluffy towel, he didn\u2019t even have it in him to crack a joke about being nude. His eyes flickering all over the room until they found mine. He stayed glued to my face as I dried him off, dragging him into his bedroom. There was a robe laid across a chair that I slipped over him, tying it at the waist. I nudged him gently towards the bed pulling back the covers making him lay down.</p><p>\u201cYou need to warm up. F.R.I.D.A.Y. turn the fireplace on and turn the song up a little please.\u201d</p><p>I sat next to Tony leaning on the headboard, without nudging or asking he laid his head on my chest and wrapped his arms around me. I pulled the covers up and around us and ran my fingers through his hair. I was doing my best to control my own breathing, tried to focus on deep breaths like he\u2019d done for me earlier. I traced patterns onto his back and started to sing the words to the song. My shirt damp with tears that silently fled his eyes, I leaned down and kissed the top of his head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright, you don\u2019t have to say anything. It\u2019s about time for someone to share that weight. Nothing leaves this place, in this bed, in these arms, you\u2019re not Iron Man or the Billionaire playboy, you\u2019re just Tony, nothing more nothing less. You move or talk whenever you\u2019re ready, I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d I could feel his head nod as I stroked his hair. \u201cWould it bother you if I talked?\u201d He shook his head no, now I knew what he meant when he told me it broke him to see me in a full blown panic attack, I felt it towards him right now.</p><p>\u201cYou said something earlier that bothered me, couldn\u2019t get it out of my head, a typical woman right?\u201d I could feel his forehead scrunch up. \u201cYou said you had a soft spot for me, now that could mean various things by my thinking. Maybe it means you view me as just a friend, or maybe an annoying little sister or maybe its a long shot though that you uh\u2026feel something a little deeper.\u201d His breathing had slowed, tears stopped flowing, I could see his eyes go wide in emotion I couldn\u2019t place. \u201cMy money, what little I\u2019ve got, is on the latter and that would explain why my favorite snacks and alcohol are the only ones ever fully stocked, or why my shower seems to have an endless supply of hot water, or why my battle uniform is suddenly made out of some new fangled kevlar that quite literally saved my ass earlier today. This isn\u2019t the time to really have this conversation like you stated earlier, but we will at sometime soon revisit this.\u201d I hugged him tightly, kissing the top of his head again. He smelled like sage, musk, cedar, and hint of lavender, I internally laughed almost thinking he\u2019d smell of WD-40, Vibrainium and blow torch fumes.</p><p>\u201cIt sucks to feel like this, I thought it was better to keep it all inside because I\u2019d rather the pain destroy me than everyone else around me, but it took until you today to get me to realize that I wasn\u2019t protecting anyone from my pain, I hurt someone very dear to me. My Grandmother used to say, 'if you can\u2019t get someone off your mind; it\u2019s because your mind always knows what your heart is thinking.\u2019 I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a day that\u2019s gone by that he hasn\u2019t been on my mind, but that\u2019s for another day I suppose.\u201d</p><p>We laid in silence for hours after that, falling asleep clutching on tightly to each other. It was the first restful nights\u2019 sleep in a while. The light from sunrise gleamed through the bedroom window straight into my eyes waking me from a pleasant dream. \u00a0 My eyes groggily opened to see the fireplace still going, the music still playing, I was spooning Tony who laid in front of me. My right arm numb from his weight sleeping on it all night, I tried to move my arm from beneath him without waking him up. I felt his fingers intertwine in my left hand, he brought it to his lips, kissing my knuckles.</p><p>\u201cMornin\u2019 Angel.\u201d He groaned moving slightly so I could take back my numb and momentarily useless arm, he landed on his back, eyes watching intently as I sat up and rubbed the life back into my arm.</p><p>\u201cDIdn\u2019t mean to wake you,\u201d I smiled sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been awake for a while, I didn\u2019t want to move if I\u2019m being fully honest. By the way, do you know you snore? I mean it\u2019s so soft that it\u2019s kind of cute but still you snore,\u201d the way he laughed made his eyes lit up, a big difference than how they looked when I found him last night.</p><p>\u201cI do not!\u201d Playfully slapping his arm, \u201cwhatever, you talk in your sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm, did I say anything incriminating?\u201d An eye quirked upward.</p><p>\u201cJust that you love me and you were trying to fight the Galaxy to prove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds about right. Dinner tonight?\u201d He smirked. \u201cJust me and you. Then we can revisit your conversation last night and plan for the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe future?\u201d I tilted my head in confusion.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DGemKqzILV4w\"><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GemKqzILV4w?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure></p>",

For some of the smartest, wisest, deadliest, most observant and toughest people in the world, they were utterly oblivious to the struggle in front of their eyes. How could I expect them to save me though when I couldn\u2019t even save myself? \u00a0I could feel it coming, the dread, my heart started racing, the walls felt like they were closing in, my breathing ragged, I could feel the heat of my flushed skin creeping up my chest and into my neck. I was no longer paying attention to the conversation going on in the lounge, I tugged at my sweatshirt collar that suddenly felt like it was strangling my airway. I felt sick to my stomach, sweat beading on my forehead, I shot out off the couch like a jackrabbit searching for a place to hide and ride it out. How could I explain this to anyone, they wouldn\u2019t understand?</p><p>For a week the panic attacks hit me hard on a daily basis. I hid it from everyone, a week spent getting a closer look around the Compound and all the nooks and crannies to hide in. The dread and the fear, my heart literally skipping beats and stopping before sluggishly ramping up again, shortness of breath, I would have looked an utter wreck if anyone had come upon me. When the panic attacks started I tried breathing into a bag, holding my head between my knees, running around the track to get rid of the incessant feeling to run, aromatherapy junk, I tried it all and it didn\u2019t help me. So I\u2019d curled up into a tight ball until it\u2019d pass, sometimes I\u2019d be laying there for an hour before it passed.</p><p>The first time it hit hard, I barely managed to get into my room before the panic got too severe. In my hast, I\u2019d knocked over my iPod and its docking station, for an hour it played the same song over and over, I memorized the words, Chasing Cars by Snow Patrol. The next attack, I lay curled up on the floor of a utility closet near the hanger repeating the words to the song. The attack didn\u2019t last as long as the others. Every time I felt that sick, stomach tightening feeling of dread, the sweat on my forehead, I\u2019d run for cover and ball up muttering the words to the song until it passed. It wasn\u2019t perfect but it was better than what it was in the beginning.</p><p>Today was a no good rotten day from the start, the dread and feeling of impending doom clung to me the second I awoke. \u00a0What should have been a quick in and out mission turned into major casualties. It wasn\u2019t my fault, we\u2019d gotten terrible intel, but it didn\u2019t matter, I blamed myself. I paced back and forth in the jet on the way home, anxious for the bay doors to open so I could run. I could feel their eyes on me, Steve, Bucky, Nat, Clint, the faint mumblings wondering if I was alright. I paced back and forth biting my fingernails. The second those doors started to part I was crawling out before they could even finish saying my name.</p><p>I raced across the hangar floor, ignoring the stares, I ran and ran until I found myself in front of Tony\u2019s lab. There was a note stuck to the door telling Bruce that Tony\u2019d be back in two hours. Good, plenty of time to have my little episode and get out before anyone saw the trembling mess I\u2019d become. I felt weak, subhuman like I had a parasite inside me that I couldn\u2019t kill, it just kept nagging at my brain finding it funny at my internal torture.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with her? She\u2019s been a little off for a while.\u201d Wanda questioned worriedly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure but when she\u2019s ready she\u2019ll tell us,\u201d Steve spoke.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been going on too long, don\u2019t you think she would have said something by now?\u201d Bucky pointed out. Tony entered the lounged, staring confused at the impromptu get together as he poured himself a drink.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the haps team? Mission did not go as planned?\u201d He chugged his whiskey.</p><p>\u201cNot even close, bad intel, a lot of people got hurt,\u201d Clint said picking at his bow.</p><p>\u201cY/n?\u201d Tony\u2019s eyes on Steve.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s didn\u2019t get hurt but somethings going on with her and we don\u2019t know what.\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y chimed in interrupting Steve.</p><p>\u201cThere is a code Stark in your lab sir.\u201d Tony tilted his head confused.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m here, how can there be a code Stark without Stark F.R.I.D.A.Y.? Are you glitching out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo sir, I am functioning properly, it\u2019s Y/n having a code Stark.\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y. stated.</p><p>\u201cNo one gets within 20 yards of that lab you understand F.R.I.D.A.Y., run Protocol Snow, now!\u201d Tony ran out of the lounge and down to his lab, leaving the rest of the team in flustered confusion.</p><p>I lay curled on the floor, mumbling the words of the song, eyes shut, tears pooling down my face, body shaking in tremors. The song started to play softly through the lab, the door creaked opened and closed, I was trying to concentrate on slowing my breathing. I could hear faint footsteps near me and a gasp, arms were wrapped around me and a warm body pressed against me on the cold cement floor, his hand stroking my hair.</p><p>\u201cOh Kitten,\u201d was all he said before he kissed the top of my head. We laid on the floor and he held me tight without speaking.</p><p>\u201cJust breath, I\u2019ve got you. F.R.I.D.A.Y., lock down the lab.\u201d He whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes Sir,\u201d answered F.R.I.D.A.Y.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re going through. You\u2019ve hidden it better than I did. Just breathe, not from here,\u201d he put his hand lightly on my chest and moved it to my stomach, \u201cbreath from here. That\u2019s it, there ya go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d My breath was still shaky.</p><p>\u201cAfter New York, I was a total wreck, wouldn\u2019t leave my room for days on end, drank myself into a drunken mess. The Ultron debacle didn\u2019t help either it got worse, then the Accords and Team Cap, finding out about my parents and Bucky. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever be alright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you cope?\u201d My breathing finally steady, the sickly feeling disappearing, I no longer felt like I was drowning in my own failures.</p><p>\u201cI keep myself busy, too busy to think about anything. There\u2019s always something to do, something to improve. The only time it gets really bad is when I\u2019m trying to sleep. It\u2019s the only time I can\u2019t quiet my mind and the thoughts running through it. Eventually, total exhaustion wins and I pass out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s terrible, I thought I was bad for hiding, at least I can sleep.\u201d I cupped his hand still on my stomach and laced my fingers with his, I could feel the hot breath from his sigh on my head.</p><p>\u201cIt gets better in the morning when I get to see your smile.\u201d A soft chuckle rumbled through his chest.</p><p>\u201cI hate to break it too you but I\u2019ve been faking those smiles,\u201d I sighed.</p><p>\u201cNot this smile. It\u2019s the \u2018first sip of coffee, I\u2019m determined my day will be better\u2019 smile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re never awake that early, how do you know that smile,\u201d a soft laugh escaped my lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen it,\u201d his voice deep and serious.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know to play that song, Tony?\u201d I could feel his chest heave that giant sigh through my back.</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y. alerted me the first night it happened. I saw it up on my screen over there,\u201d he pointed to a lab table, \u201cit broke me seeing you go through something like that. I started Protocol Snow,\u201d his voice nervous.</p><p>\u201cProtocol Snow?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cNot my best idea I suppose. The song, I had it softly piped into any room you were in to help you through it. I should have just found you and done this,\u201d hugging me tighter, \u201cbut I know my reputation. I was afraid you\u2019d think I was trying to take advantage of you. I regret letting you suffer alone for so long. I know better than anyone the anguish of suffering alone, just wanting someone to grip you tight to bring you back to the here and now. A heartbeat to focus on other than the rapid pace of your own. I\u2019m guessing you think I\u2019m kinda creepy right now huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot totally,\u201d I lightly elbowed his stomach. \u201cMy brain is still trying to figure out how you know my morning smile when you\u2019re not out of bed before 11 a.m.\u201d He sighed and pulled away sitting up behind me.</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y. reset my alarm to go off in one minute and put it on my workbench screen, please. Look, I\u2019m not gonna lie, I\u2019ve got a soft spot for you Y/n, have since you joined the team and now is not the time to be saying this to you, but you have to understand what you\u2019re about to see. I look at that every morning, every time I get up and I think to myself, 'if she can make it through another day so can I. If she can face the world as much as she wants to hide from it, then I can get my sorry ass out of bed.\u2019 All you\u2019ve been through your entire life even before the panic attacks started, everything trying to knock you down, keep you down, and you keep pulling yourself up fighting back. These panic episodes, they\u2019re not a weakness so get that out of your head right now, it\u2019s just another obstacle to kick in the ass, and when you do, you\u2019ll come out shining like the angel I see inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony\u2026I.\u201d The alarm went off playing my song, a video flashed on the screen of me sitting at the kitchen table surrounded by the team, steaming hot cup of coffee in my hand, hair in a messy bun, sweater hanging off my shoulder exposing the bare skin and the sleep tank-top beneath. I gasp staring at the screen, sitting up, my hands covering my mouth. I see myself on the video breathe in the smell of the coffee, a small smirk creeps across my face as I take my first sip. My eyes close as I savor the flavor, it\u2019s life-giving energy flowing through my system, my smile widens. Someone must have told a joke or said something funny, my eyes open, head tilts back and I let out a laugh, a real laugh I haven\u2019t heard come out of my own mouth in some time. The smile on my face genuine and real, the crinkles around my eyes give it away. I stare off into space smiling, the video makes it look as if I\u2019m staring right at myself. A sparkle in my eyes, a massive grin on my face as if I\u2019m staring at something I adore. The video pauses and all you can see is me, smiling.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean this to be all creepy stalker-like, I never meant it like that, but when Happy pointed this out on that on the security feed he was reviewing, I found inspiration in it. You were braver than I ever could be, and I wanted to be able to cope with my own shit like you. To get up and face the world even though I felt like I was dying inside.\u201d I wasn\u2019t moving or talking just staring at the screen, my eyes scrunched up in confusion. \u201cMaybe I should go,\u201d he said as he stood up to walk out, I jumped up after him.</p><p>\u201cWait, Tony,\u201d I grabbed his hand pulling him back towards me. He stood staring in my eyes, his own flashing regret, and shame, a tinge of hope. I rushed into him wrapping my arms around him, my head resting on his shoulder, he tensed at the sudden movement before his own arms snaked around me. \u201cThank you, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s creepy, it\u2019s kinda sweet actually.\u201d I held onto to him tightly not wanting to let go, but he coughed nervously, stepped back and smiled.</p><p>\u201cGo on Kitten, go relax, I\u2019ll see you at dinner?\u201d He tried shooing me out of his lab.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t miss it, save you a seat?\u201d I smirked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hold you to it.\u201d His eyes saying something different than his smile.</p><p>I took a nice long hot shower while thinking of that video. I was an inspiration for the Great Tony Stark, I couldn\u2019t wrap my head around it. He always seemed so together, so calm, but all these years he was losing his shit mentally in silence. It didn\u2019t seem fair, he\u2019d done so much for others but never said a thing, never once complained, he acted just like me. Hid away and suffered in silence, he deserved better than that.</p><p>Dinner rolled around, I saved him a seat next to me but he never showed. I ate dinner in silence listening to the conversations around me, wondering in my head whether he was alright. Maybe he lost track of time in his lab like he usually does. I went to the kitchen and made him up a plate, knabbing some silverware and a beer out of the fridge and headed down to the lab, only to find it empty.</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y. could you please locate Tony for me?\u201d I croaked worried.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in his bungalow, Miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes F.R.I.D.A.Y.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would hurry if I were you,\u201d was all the A.I. said.</p><p>I hightailed it out of the building and across the lawn to Tony\u2019s private bungalow. His escapades with the ladies had gotten him in trouble over the years, some of them just used him to get onto the Compound to chase after the likes of Steve or Thor, occasionally Nat to our surprise, so he moved out of the living quarters and into his own little hideaway. Now that I\u2019d thought about it, I hadn\u2019t seen Tony even glance at another woman in ages. I walked through the doors so silence except for the running water of his shower in the back of the house. I set his dinner on the kitchen counter and wandered towards his bedroom.</p><p>\u201cTony, you okay? You missed dinner,\u201d I called out. There was a muffled response I couldn\u2019t make out. I walked into his bedroom to see him in the shower fully clothed sitting with his back against the shower wall, knees up to his chest, red puffy dead looking eyes, soaked to the bone, cold water running on him.</p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d I screamed rushing to turn the water off, I dropped to my knees, water splashing everywhere, pulled him into me, his head resting on my chest, a hand clawing onto my arm holding tight. \u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y. Protocol Snow, lock down the bungalow, no interruptions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony you\u2019re freezing, come on, let me help you up, you can\u2019t stay in these wet clothes, you\u2019ll get sick.\u201d He let me help him up, his body swayed like he was drunk, he blinked slowly, I could feel his heart beat like a crazed drummer during a solo as I unbuttoned his shirt. His chest heaving raggedly breathing as if he was choking. His own panic attack, just as severe as my own. \u00a0I slipped off his jeans, wrapping his naked body in a big fluffy towel, he didn\u2019t even have it in him to crack a joke about being nude. His eyes flickering all over the room until they found mine. He stayed glued to my face as I dried him off, dragging him into his bedroom. There was a robe laid across a chair that I slipped over him, tying it at the waist. I nudged him gently towards the bed pulling back the covers making him lay down.</p><p>\u201cYou need to warm up. F.R.I.D.A.Y. turn the fireplace on and turn the song up a little please.\u201d</p><p>I sat next to Tony leaning on the headboard, without nudging or asking he laid his head on my chest and wrapped his arms around me. I pulled the covers up and around us and ran my fingers through his hair. I was doing my best to control my own breathing, tried to focus on deep breaths like he\u2019d done for me earlier. I traced patterns onto his back and started to sing the words to the song. My shirt damp with tears that silently fled his eyes, I leaned down and kissed the top of his head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright, you don\u2019t have to say anything. It\u2019s about time for someone to share that weight. Nothing leaves this place, in this bed, in these arms, you\u2019re not Iron Man or the Billionaire playboy, you\u2019re just Tony, nothing more nothing less. You move or talk whenever you\u2019re ready, I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d I could feel his head nod as I stroked his hair. \u201cWould it bother you if I talked?\u201d He shook his head no, now I knew what he meant when he told me it broke him to see me in a full blown panic attack, I felt it towards him right now.</p><p>\u201cYou said something earlier that bothered me, couldn\u2019t get it out of my head, a typical woman right?\u201d I could feel his forehead scrunch up. \u201cYou said you had a soft spot for me, now that could mean various things by my thinking. Maybe it means you view me as just a friend, or maybe an annoying little sister or maybe its a long shot though that you uh\u2026feel something a little deeper.\u201d His breathing had slowed, tears stopped flowing, I could see his eyes go wide in emotion I couldn\u2019t place. \u201cMy money, what little I\u2019ve got, is on the latter and that would explain why my favorite snacks and alcohol are the only ones ever fully stocked, or why my shower seems to have an endless supply of hot water, or why my battle uniform is suddenly made out of some new fangled kevlar that quite literally saved my ass earlier today. This isn\u2019t the time to really have this conversation like you stated earlier, but we will at sometime soon revisit this.\u201d I hugged him tightly, kissing the top of his head again. He smelled like sage, musk, cedar, and hint of lavender, I internally laughed almost thinking he\u2019d smell of WD-40, Vibrainium and blow torch fumes.</p><p>\u201cIt sucks to feel like this, I thought it was better to keep it all inside because I\u2019d rather the pain destroy me than everyone else around me, but it took until you today to get me to realize that I wasn\u2019t protecting anyone from my pain, I hurt someone very dear to me. My Grandmother used to say, 'if you can\u2019t get someone off your mind; it\u2019s because your mind always knows what your heart is thinking.\u2019 I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a day that\u2019s gone by that he hasn\u2019t been on my mind, but that\u2019s for another day I suppose.\u201d</p><p>We laid in silence for hours after that, falling asleep clutching on tightly to each other. It was the first restful nights\u2019 sleep in a while. The light from sunrise gleamed through the bedroom window straight into my eyes waking me from a pleasant dream. \u00a0 My eyes groggily opened to see the fireplace still going, the music still playing, I was spooning Tony who laid in front of me. My right arm numb from his weight sleeping on it all night, I tried to move my arm from beneath him without waking him up. I felt his fingers intertwine in my left hand, he brought it to his lips, kissing my knuckles.</p><p>\u201cMornin\u2019 Angel.\u201d He groaned moving slightly so I could take back my numb and momentarily useless arm, he landed on his back, eyes watching intently as I sat up and rubbed the life back into my arm.</p><p>\u201cDIdn\u2019t mean to wake you,\u201d I smiled sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been awake for a while, I didn\u2019t want to move if I\u2019m being fully honest. By the way, do you know you snore? I mean it\u2019s so soft that it\u2019s kind of cute but still you snore,\u201d the way he laughed made his eyes lit up, a big difference than how they looked when I found him last night.</p><p>\u201cI do not!\u201d Playfully slapping his arm, \u201cwhatever, you talk in your sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm, did I say anything incriminating?\u201d An eye quirked upward.</p><p>\u201cJust that you love me and you were trying to fight the Galaxy to prove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds about right. Dinner tonight?\u201d He smirked. \u201cJust me and you. Then we can revisit your conversation last night and plan for the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe future?\u201d I tilted my head in confusion.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DGemKqzILV4w\"><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GemKqzILV4w?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure></p>",

Mission did not go as planned?&rdquo; He chugged his whiskey.</p><p>&ldquo;Not even close, bad intel, a lot of people got hurt,&rdquo; Clint said picking at his bow.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n?&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s eyes on Steve.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s didn&rsquo;t get hurt but somethings going on with her and we don&rsquo;t know what.&rdquo; F.R.I.D.A.Y chimed in interrupting Steve.</p><p>&ldquo;There is a code Stark in your lab sir.&rdquo; Tony tilted his head confused.</p><p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m here, how can there be a code Stark without Stark F.R.I.D.A.Y.? Are you glitching out?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No sir, I am functioning properly, it&rsquo;s Y/n having a code Stark.&rdquo; F.R.I.D.A.Y. stated.</p><p>&ldquo;No one gets within 20 yards of that lab you understand F.R.I.D.A.Y., run Protocol Snow, now!&rdquo; Tony ran out of the lounge and down to his lab, leaving the rest of the team in flustered confusion.</p><p>I lay curled on the floor, mumbling the words of the song, eyes shut, tears pooling down my face, body shaking in tremors. The song started to play softly through the lab, the door creaked opened and closed, I was trying to concentrate on slowing my breathing. I could hear faint footsteps near me and a gasp, arms were wrapped around me and a warm body pressed against me on the cold cement floor, his hand stroking my hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh Kitten,&rdquo; was all he said before he kissed the top of my head. We laid on the floor and he held me tight without speaking.</p><p>&ldquo;Just breath, I&rsquo;ve got you. F.R.I.D.A.Y., lock down the lab.&rdquo; He whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes Sir,&rdquo; answered F.R.I.D.A.Y.</p><p>&ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re going through. You&rsquo;ve hidden it better than I did. Just breathe, not from here,&rdquo; he put his hand lightly on my chest and moved it to my stomach, &ldquo;breath from here. That&rsquo;s it, there ya go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; My breath was still shaky.</p><p>&ldquo;After New York, I was a total wreck, wouldn&rsquo;t leave my room for days on end, drank myself into a drunken mess. The Ultron debacle didn&rsquo;t help either it got worse, then the Accords and Team Cap, finding out about my parents and Bucky. I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ll ever be alright.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you cope?&rdquo; My breathing finally steady, the sickly feeling disappearing, I no longer felt like I was drowning in my own failures.</p><p>&ldquo;I keep myself busy, too busy to think about anything. There&rsquo;s always something to do, something to improve. The only time it gets really bad is when I&rsquo;m trying to sleep. It&rsquo;s the only time I can&rsquo;t quiet my mind and the thoughts running through it. Eventually, total exhaustion wins and I pass out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s terrible, I thought I was bad for hiding, at least I can sleep.&rdquo; I cupped his hand still on my stomach and laced my fingers with his, I could feel the hot breath from his sigh on my head.</p><p>&ldquo;It gets better in the morning when I get to see your smile.&rdquo; A soft chuckle rumbled through his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;I hate to break it too you but I&rsquo;ve been faking those smiles,&rdquo; I sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;Not this smile. It&rsquo;s the &lsquo;first sip of coffee, I&rsquo;m determined my day will be better&rsquo; smile.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re never awake that early, how do you know that smile,&rdquo; a soft laugh escaped my lips.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen it,&rdquo; his voice deep and serious.</p><p>&ldquo;How did you know to play that song, Tony?&rdquo; I could feel his chest heave that giant sigh through my back.</p><p>&ldquo;F.R.I.D.A.Y. alerted me the first night it happened. I saw it up on my screen over there,&rdquo; he pointed to a lab table, &ldquo;it broke me seeing you go through something like that. I started Protocol Snow,&rdquo; his voice nervous.</p><p>&ldquo;Protocol Snow?&rdquo; I whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;Not my best idea I suppose. The song, I had it softly piped into any room you were in to help you through it. I should have just found you and done this,&rdquo; hugging me tighter, &ldquo;but I know my reputation. I was afraid you&rsquo;d think I was trying to take advantage of you. I regret letting you suffer alone for so long. I know better than anyone the anguish of suffering alone, just wanting someone to grip you tight to bring you back to the here and now. A heartbeat to focus on other than the rapid pace of your own. I&rsquo;m guessing you think I&rsquo;m kinda creepy right now huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not totally,&rdquo; I lightly elbowed his stomach. &ldquo;My brain is still trying to figure out how you know my morning smile when you&rsquo;re not out of bed before 11 a.m.&rdquo; He sighed and pulled away sitting up behind me.</p><p>&ldquo;F.R.I.D.A.Y. reset my alarm to go off in one minute and put it on my workbench screen, please. Look, I&rsquo;m not gonna lie, I&rsquo;ve got a soft spot for you Y/n, have since you joined the team and now is not the time to be saying this to you, but you have to understand what you&rsquo;re about to see. I look at that every morning, every time I get up and I think to myself, 'if she can make it through another day so can I. If she can face the world as much as she wants to hide from it, then I can get my sorry ass out of bed.&rsquo; All you&rsquo;ve been through your entire life even before the panic attacks started, everything trying to knock you down, keep you down, and you keep pulling yourself up fighting back. These panic episodes, they&rsquo;re not a weakness so get that out of your head right now, it&rsquo;s just another obstacle to kick in the ass, and when you do, you&rsquo;ll come out shining like the angel I see inside.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony&hellip;I.&rdquo; The alarm went off playing my song, a video flashed on the screen of me sitting at the kitchen table surrounded by the team, steaming hot cup of coffee in my hand, hair in a messy bun, sweater hanging off my shoulder exposing the bare skin and the sleep tank-top beneath. I gasp staring at the screen, sitting up, my hands covering my mouth. I see myself on the video breathe in the smell of the coffee, a small smirk creeps across my face as I take my first sip. My eyes close as I savor the flavor, it&rsquo;s life-giving energy flowing through my system, my smile widens. Someone must have told a joke or said something funny, my eyes open, head tilts back and I let out a laugh, a real laugh I haven&rsquo;t heard come out of my own mouth in some time. The smile on my face genuine and real, the crinkles around my eyes give it away. I stare off into space smiling, the video makes it look as if I&rsquo;m staring right at myself. A sparkle in my eyes, a massive grin on my face as if I&rsquo;m staring at something I adore. The video pauses and all you can see is me, smiling.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean this to be all creepy stalker-like, I never meant it like that, but when Happy pointed this out on that on the security feed he was reviewing, I found inspiration in it. You were braver than I ever could be, and I wanted to be able to cope with my own shit like you. To get up and face the world even though I felt like I was dying inside.&rdquo; I wasn&rsquo;t moving or talking just staring at the screen, my eyes scrunched up in confusion. &ldquo;Maybe I should go,&rdquo; he said as he stood up to walk out, I jumped up after him.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, Tony,&rdquo; I grabbed his hand pulling him back towards me. He stood staring in my eyes, his own flashing regret, and shame, a tinge of hope. I rushed into him wrapping my arms around him, my head resting on his shoulder, he tensed at the sudden movement before his own arms snaked around me. &ldquo;Thank you, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s creepy, it&rsquo;s kinda sweet actually.&rdquo; I held onto to him tightly not wanting to let go, but he coughed nervously, stepped back and smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Go on Kitten, go relax, I&rsquo;ll see you at dinner?&rdquo; He tried shooing me out of his lab.</p><p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t miss it, save you a seat?&rdquo; I smirked.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hold you to it.&rdquo; His eyes saying something different than his smile.</p><p>I took a nice long hot shower while thinking of that video. I was an inspiration for the Great Tony Stark, I couldn&rsquo;t wrap my head around it. He always seemed so together, so calm, but all these years he was losing his shit mentally in silence. It didn&rsquo;t seem fair, he&rsquo;d done so much for others but never said a thing, never once complained, he acted just like me. Hid away and suffered in silence, he deserved better than that.</p><p>Dinner rolled around, I saved him a seat next to me but he never showed. I ate dinner in silence listening to the conversations around me, wondering in my head whether he was alright. Maybe he lost track of time in his lab like he usually does. I went to the kitchen and made him up a plate, knabbing some silverware and a beer out of the fridge and headed down to the lab, only to find it empty.</p><p>&ldquo;F.R.I.D.A.Y. could you please locate Tony for me?&rdquo; I croaked worried.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in his bungalow, Miss.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Miss?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes F.R.I.D.A.Y.?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I would hurry if I were you,&rdquo; was all the A.I. said.</p><p>I hightailed it out of the building and across the lawn to Tony&rsquo;s private bungalow. His escapades with the ladies had gotten him in trouble over the years, some of them just used him to get onto the Compound to chase after the likes of Steve or Thor, occasionally Nat to our surprise, so he moved out of the living quarters and into his own little hideaway. Now that I&rsquo;d thought about it, I hadn&rsquo;t seen Tony even glance at another woman in ages. I walked through the doors so silence except for the running water of his shower in the back of the house. I set his dinner on the kitchen counter and wandered towards his bedroom.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony, you okay? You missed dinner,&rdquo; I called out. There was a muffled response I couldn&rsquo;t make out. I walked into his bedroom to see him in the shower fully clothed sitting with his back against the shower wall, knees up to his chest, red puffy dead looking eyes, soaked to the bone, cold water running on him.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony!&rdquo; I screamed rushing to turn the water off, I dropped to my knees, water splashing everywhere, pulled him into me, his head resting on my chest, a hand clawing onto my arm holding tight. &ldquo;F.R.I.D.A.Y. Protocol Snow, lock down the bungalow, no interruptions.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony you&rsquo;re freezing, come on, let me help you up, you can&rsquo;t stay in these wet clothes, you&rsquo;ll get sick.&rdquo; He let me help him up, his body swayed like he was drunk, he blinked slowly, I could feel his heart beat like a crazed drummer during a solo as I unbuttoned his shirt. His chest heaving raggedly breathing as if he was choking. His own panic attack, just as severe as my own. &nbsp;I slipped off his jeans, wrapping his naked body in a big fluffy towel, he didn&rsquo;t even have it in him to crack a joke about being nude. His eyes flickering all over the room until they found mine. He stayed glued to my face as I dried him off, dragging him into his bedroom. There was a robe laid across a chair that I slipped over him, tying it at the waist. I nudged him gently towards the bed pulling back the covers making him lay down.</p><p>&ldquo;You need to warm up. F.R.I.D.A.Y. turn the fireplace on and turn the song up a little please.&rdquo;</p><p>I sat next to Tony leaning on the headboard, without nudging or asking he laid his head on my chest and wrapped his arms around me. I pulled the covers up and around us and ran my fingers through his hair. I was doing my best to control my own breathing, tried to focus on deep breaths like he&rsquo;d done for me earlier. I traced patterns onto his back and started to sing the words to the song. My shirt damp with tears that silently fled his eyes, I leaned down and kissed the top of his head.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright, you don&rsquo;t have to say anything. It&rsquo;s about time for someone to share that weight. Nothing leaves this place, in this bed, in these arms, you&rsquo;re not Iron Man or the Billionaire playboy, you&rsquo;re just Tony, nothing more nothing less. You move or talk whenever you&rsquo;re ready, I&rsquo;m not going anywhere.&rdquo; I could feel his head nod as I stroked his hair. &ldquo;Would it bother you if I talked?&rdquo; He shook his head no, now I knew what he meant when he told me it broke him to see me in a full blown panic attack, I felt it towards him right now.</p><p>&ldquo;You said something earlier that bothered me, couldn&rsquo;t get it out of my head, a typical woman right?&rdquo; I could feel his forehead scrunch up. &ldquo;You said you had a soft spot for me, now that could mean various things by my thinking. Maybe it means you view me as just a friend, or maybe an annoying little sister or maybe its a long shot though that you uh&hellip;feel something a little deeper.&rdquo; His breathing had slowed, tears stopped flowing, I could see his eyes go wide in emotion I couldn&rsquo;t place. &ldquo;My money, what little I&rsquo;ve got, is on the latter and that would explain why my favorite snacks and alcohol are the only ones ever fully stocked, or why my shower seems to have an endless supply of hot water, or why my battle uniform is suddenly made out of some new fangled kevlar that quite literally saved my ass earlier today. This isn&rsquo;t the time to really have this conversation like you stated earlier, but we will at sometime soon revisit this.&rdquo; I hugged him tightly, kissing the top of his head again. He smelled like sage, musk, cedar, and hint of lavender, I internally laughed almost thinking he&rsquo;d smell of WD-40, Vibrainium and blow torch fumes.</p><p>&ldquo;It sucks to feel like this, I thought it was better to keep it all inside because I&rsquo;d rather the pain destroy me than everyone else around me, but it took until you today to get me to realize that I wasn&rsquo;t protecting anyone from my pain, I hurt someone very dear to me. My Grandmother used to say, 'if you can&rsquo;t get someone off your mind; it&rsquo;s because your mind always knows what your heart is thinking.&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a day that&rsquo;s gone by that he hasn&rsquo;t been on my mind, but that&rsquo;s for another day I suppose.&rdquo;</p><p>We laid in silence for hours after that, falling asleep clutching on tightly to each other. It was the first restful nights&rsquo; sleep in a while. The light from sunrise gleamed through the bedroom window straight into my eyes waking me from a pleasant dream. &nbsp; My eyes groggily opened to see the fireplace still going, the music still playing, I was spooning Tony who laid in front of me. My right arm numb from his weight sleeping on it all night, I tried to move my arm from beneath him without waking him up. I felt his fingers intertwine in my left hand, he brought it to his lips, kissing my knuckles.</p><p>&ldquo;Mornin&rsquo; Angel.&rdquo; He groaned moving slightly so I could take back my numb and momentarily useless arm, he landed on his back, eyes watching intently as I sat up and rubbed the life back into my arm.</p><p>&ldquo;DIdn&rsquo;t mean to wake you,&rdquo; I smiled sheepishly.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been awake for a while, I didn&rsquo;t want to move if I&rsquo;m being fully honest. By the way, do you know you snore? I mean it&rsquo;s so soft that it&rsquo;s kind of cute but still you snore,&rdquo; the way he laughed made his eyes lit up, a big difference than how they looked when I found him last night.</p><p>&ldquo;I do not!&rdquo; Playfully slapping his arm, &ldquo;whatever, you talk in your sleep.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mhm, did I say anything incriminating?&rdquo; An eye quirked upward.</p><p>&ldquo;Just that you love me and you were trying to fight the Galaxy to prove it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sounds about right. Dinner tonight?&rdquo; He smirked. &ldquo;Just me and you. Then we can revisit your conversation last night and plan for the future.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The future?&rdquo; I tilted my head in confusion.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\"><p><a href=\"#\"><img src=\"https://assets.tumblr.com/images/inline_placeholder.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"14\"/></a></p></figure></p>",
