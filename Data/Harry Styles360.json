He looks so gorgeous in that moment that I almost think of dropping the subject altogether. The sunset is casting its glow on his face making him look more angelic that he already does.It&rsquo;s tempting to give up,take back my words,anything to not ruin this peaceful moment with him.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; The words burn on my tongue like the rooftop we are sitting on burns my skin from absorbing all that sunlight during the day. &ldquo;We are the immediate results of our actions.Every choice we make,bad or good,affects out future. All our mistakes determine who we become. Our good decisions too. It&rsquo;s really comforting to think that everything happens for a reason, that everything we&rsquo;re going through is set to happen the way it is, but it&rsquo;s not true. There&rsquo;s no greater purpose in this life, Harry. You make your own path. We&rsquo;re suffering because of our mistakes but we&rsquo;re the ones that made them in the first place. \"I finally look up to meet his eyes.</p><p>His mouth has fallen open and he looks taken back from my words. A couple of minutes pass by before he talks. \"But we&rsquo;re here.We haven&rsquo;t talked in almost a year and yet here we are. It can&rsquo;t be random and it has nothing to do with the decisions we&rsquo;ve made in the past. \"He shuffles a little closer so our faces almost touch. The warmth radiating from his body is a feeling I had almost forgotten.</p><p>\"Yes,it does.&rdquo; I whisper desperately,shifting my gaze to the ground ,&ldquo;If we hadn&rsquo;t broken up we would-\"a whimper escapes my mouth as I feel the all too familiar burning sensation in my eyes,\"we wouldn&rsquo;t be here. We would probably be at our home, watching the sunset from the large window in the living room,trying to decide how to spend our Friday night.&rdquo; The memory unleashes a new set of emotions and my heart is aches,the same way it has for months now. &ldquo;So there&rsquo;s no destiny, just the results of every fucking decison we&rsquo;ve made.&rdquo;</p><p>I feel his hand cupping my jaw then,lifting my face so he can look me in the eyes,the contact sending chills down my spine. His eyes are red and brimming with tears,like mine.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry,please. I hate it when you do. Please baby,don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; His voice is shaky and as much I want to push him away and tell him that he has no right to ask me that when he&rsquo;s the one causing it in the first place, I can&rsquo;t.Instead, I close my eyes letting the tears fall freely. He immediately pulls me closer,bringing my head to rest on his shoulder as I sob and stain his white t-shirt with my tears.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not long before Harry starts crying too. I feel his chest rising and falling rapidly as he gasps for air. His fingers press into my skin and I feel my heart breaking all over again. &ldquo;Why do we have to be so broken,Harry?What did we do to deserve this?&rdquo;</p><p>He mutters something incoherrent between sobs before taking a couple of deep breaths so he can talk again. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,I&rsquo;m sorry.But it hurts so bad, I can&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m not-\"his words are muffled by the way he pressed his head in my hair.</p><p>We stay like that for a few more minutes,but it could might as well be hours. Our breathing has calmed and the tears are dry on both of our cheeks. I take a look at Harry, his eyes are shut and he&rsquo;s biting his lip,as if he&rsquo;s trying to stop another wave of crying from taking over. He must have sensed me observing him and he slowly opens his eyes. He looks like a complete mess,but it brings me some sort of comfort,maybe because I feel the same way too.</p><p>\"Maybe you were right,maybe it&rsquo;s out fault that we ended up like this.&rdquo; He confesses and I can only wrap my arms around him and squeeze him tight.</p><p>The sun has been long lost beyond the horizon, leaving only a tiny amount of light behind.The sky has turned deep blue and is  filled with stars already.It&rsquo;s a beautiful night in contrast with the infinite pain swirling around in my body and mind. Harry must have  sensed that too, because he shifts underneath me so he can pull me closer and rub my back in comfort. And for the first time in months I feel something. Even though it&rsquo;s small and barely there, I can&rsquo;t ignore it.It&rsquo;s like a spark lit in the deepest and darkest corner of my existence.</p><p>&ldquo;Is this the end?&rdquo; I find myself asking,because I need to know what does this all mean. Is this the closure we never got? The answer to all of my prayers asking for the pain to stop? The peace I&rsquo;ve dreamt for? But how could it mean any of that if it is the end?</p><p>&ldquo;It sure doesn&rsquo;t feel like it.\"Harry presses a kiss to my forehead and the feeling is so new and familiar at the same time that I feel  thousands of butterflies coursing through my body,\"But we&rsquo;ll be alright. That,I promise you.&rdquo;</p></p>",
