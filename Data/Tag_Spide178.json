                "content": "<p>In recent memory, there have been three different big-screen live-action interpretations of Spider-Man. There have also been multiple TV and movie adaptations of Superman and Batman, as well as a couple different versions of The Flash, Hulk and Daredevil.</p><p>It&rsquo;s obvious that Hollywood can&rsquo;t get enough of superheroes, and so it revisits their stories again and again. Nowadays, adaptations, reboots, revivals, sequels and prequels have become a standard part of the pop-culture landscape, and the impressive box office and fan fervor surrounding these titles ensures that trend will continue for a long time to come.</p><p>When filmmakers adapt comics into movies and TV shows, they must work within the confines of a pre-established world while remixing and re-interpreting the stories for a new medium, often introducing new storylines, new characters, and unexpected relationships. In doing so, the creators of these properties are engaged in the same kind of activity as fan fiction writers. Furthermore, the audiences who flock to see these big-budget Hollywood affairs or follow the exploits of their favorite hero on TV are often scratching the same itch as fan fiction readers.<br /></p><p><b>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/miles-morales-sara-pichelli-into-the-spider-verse/\">Miles Morales Co-Creator Shares Her Contribution to Into the Spider-Verse</a></b></p><p>Some may immediately recoil at the idea that our most popular entertainment could be a form of fan fiction, those fan-written stories that use major components of known pop culture properties to create new, often unexpected narratives. Fan fiction is often derided as derivative and unoriginal, yet, because of the Internet, fan fiction is now more visible than ever, and whole archives have popped up where fans can read and share their unofficial stories.</p><p>While fan fiction has mostly attracted attention for its sexually explicit content and tendency to romantically pair same-sex characters, it&rsquo;s a lot more than that. These works enable fans to stay in the worlds of their favorite stories with their favorite characters. In the process, fans revise and reimagine whole parts of various narratives, delve deeper into characters&rsquo; motivations, or put characters in relationships they&rsquo;d never see otherwise. It also enables fans to more deeply reflect on and critique the pop culture they love.</p><p><b>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/into-spider-verse-best-spider-man-movie/\">Into the Spider-Verse Is the Best Spider-Man Movie, Period</a></b><br /></p><p>Today, much of our most popular entertainment provides the same opportunities, and nowhere is this more apparent than in <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse/\">Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</a>. This animated film features nine different Spider-folks and several different villains who all originated in comics. While there is a Spider-Verse comics event from which the film takes its cues, the movie&rsquo;s story is almost completely original. Not only did the filmmakers take the opportunity to bring these characters together, they also supplied a new vision of Peter Parker &mdash; the character fans have repeatedly seen in recent movies &mdash; as a less-than-inspiring older hero.</p><p>In addition, the film references and comments on its characters, especially through its two different versions of Parker. Not only are scenes from all three of the recent Spider-Man film series recreated, the movie also <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/spider-verse-homages-raimi-spider-man-trilogy/\">jokes about the much-ridiculed dancing Peter Parker</a> from Sam Raimi&rsquo;s Spider-Man 3.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a84caa337ab26034fef3f6b413fff6a2/tumblr_inline_pkn6htDKDa1ryu6g6_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Throughout the movie, each Spider-person is given an opportunity to tell their backstory, a trope that starts almost every superhero narrative. It&rsquo;s something most films present in a fairly straightforward, serious way. However, Into the Spider-Verse generates some laughs from the repetition, both in the film itself and from the reminder that origin stories are an all-important component of so many others.</p><p>Fans don&rsquo;t have to be familiar with Spider-Man to appreciate Into the Spider-Verse, but it sure helps. That familiarity not only provides a comfort level with the material but also a zing of delight whenever the filmmakers reference and comment on past Spider-stories. It also gives the in-the-know viewer a vehicle to think about the Spider-Man narrative more deeply.</p><p>So if it&rsquo;s created and owned by Marvel and Sony, how does Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse be classified as fan fiction? Well, watching the film and reading Spider-Man fan fiction fulfills audience cravings in similar ways. Although the latter is created by a single fan, and the former is made by hundreds of creatives backed by a hefty budget, fans can use both to experience a fresh story that will bring about new thoughts and feelings.</p><p>The real question is, why does fan fiction continue to be dismissed while many of our most popular movies and shows are considered legitimate forms of entertainment? Part of it, of course, is that the MCU, DCEU, the Arrowverse and many others, are sanctioned. Their creators have legal use of the intellectual property &mdash; something fan fiction writers, of course, aren&rsquo;t granted.</p><p><b>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/spider-man-into-spider-verse-changes-comics/\">How Spider-Man&rsquo;s Animated Spider-Verse Compares to the Comics</a></b><br /></p><p>Yet, there may be something more insidious going on too. In a blog post, obsession_inc makes a distinction between <a href=\"https://obsession-inc.dreamwidth.org/82589.html\">affirmational and transformational fans</a>. Affirmational fans discuss, analyze, collect and view artifacts from their favorite pop culture. These fans are interested in working within the boundaries set by a property and, as a result, are often courted by media creators. Transformational fans, on the other hand, want to make the source material their own by creating fan works, like fan fiction. Many creators rail against their copyrighted work being used this way, and even when they don&rsquo;t, they pay minimal attention to it. As a result, transformational fans tend to be marginalized.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4bdd703137855f229b801a1eee10e4c3/tumblr_inline_pkn6k7LxoY1ryu6g6_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Affirmational fans are typically thought to be young males, while transformational fans are typically female. Much has been made recently of the male domination of Hollywood, so, this distinction shouldn&rsquo;t come as a surprise. Much of our most popular entertainment may mimic the mechanics of fan fiction, but it&rsquo;s still driven by men.

And seeing just how much Marvel was willing to do to ensure that this really was the end made me think that they were just playing it up because they knew that a good chunk of the characters would come back in some form or fashion.

Was Wong\u2019s presence really needed if he was just going to canter on back to the Sanctum Sanctorum? Was he even in the fight? Barely? I\u2019m glad he exists and is there, but to what end? Would it not be more fitting to have all these side characters appear in the inevitable Endgame and give them further characterization and drive. What\u2019s the reason why Falcon doesn\u2019t want Thanos to win? Why doesn\u2019t Wong want Thanos to win? You can answer these questions on your own, but would it not be more interesting to visualize and give some smaller characters more spotlight?</p><p>\tNow, that\u2019s pretty much all I had for negative critiques? Does my critique stand as wish fulfillment rather than actual issues with the film? Possibly. That\u2019s pretty much all I got from Infinity War. It left a good taste in my mouth, and I likely would have been more blown away by it had it not been spoiled to me. Thanos is good, the characters who do have spotlights are good, the action is good, the movie is good. But have I said anything new for Infinity War? No. I\u2019m sure my plights and praise have been echoed far and wide. So what, I hear you ask, is the point of this hear post? Well, it was more of an exercise to see just how much control I have over you. Have you made it to this point of the post? If the answer is yes, that means you have given me control over your mind, even for the space of two minutes or so. I now control you.

And seeing just how much Marvel was willing to do to ensure that this really was the end made me think that they were just playing it up because they knew that a good chunk of the characters would come back in some form or fashion. So it makes me wonder if Marvel playing around with all these deaths and then bringing them back will ruin the sanctity of life by making everybody seem invincible.</p><p>\tAnd I understand that there&rsquo;s a whole lot to deal with it in this film, so not everybody is going to have the same amount of screen time nor overall presence. My thing is that I feel that not everybody should or could be in the movie. Tell me, what do you remember Falcon doing in the movie besides becoming dandruff flakes? Was Wong&rsquo;s presence really needed if he was just going to canter on back to the Sanctum Sanctorum? Was he even in the fight? Barely? I&rsquo;m glad he exists and is there, but to what end? Would it not be more fitting to have all these side characters appear in the inevitable Endgame and give them further characterization and drive. What&rsquo;s the reason why Falcon doesn&rsquo;t want Thanos to win? Why doesn&rsquo;t Wong want Thanos to win? You can answer these questions on your own, but would it not be more interesting to visualize and give some smaller characters more spotlight?</p><p>\tNow, that&rsquo;s pretty much all I had for negative critiques? Does my critique stand as wish fulfillment rather than actual issues with the film? Possibly. That&rsquo;s pretty much all I got from Infinity War. It left a good taste in my mouth, and I likely would have been more blown away by it had it not been spoiled to me. Thanos is good, the characters who do have spotlights are good, the action is good, the movie is good. But have I said anything new for Infinity War? No. I&rsquo;m sure my plights and praise have been echoed far and wide. So what, I hear you ask, is the point of this hear post? Well, it was more of an exercise to see just how much control I have over you. Have you made it to this point of the post? If the answer is yes, that means you have given me control over your mind, even for the space of two minutes or so. I now control you. Get me some money, I want some money to purchase House of Leaves on Amazon.</p>",
