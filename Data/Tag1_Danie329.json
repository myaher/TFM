That leaves her, in her London apartment, watching <i>Black Mirror</i> with a pint of ice cream, because when you&rsquo;re lonely, self care and healthy eating goes out the fucking window. She&rsquo;s sitting in her lounge shorts and Calvin Klein underwear. This fashion choice counteracts the muggy weather that comes along with summer. And the ice cream counteracts her gym workout, because, honestly, <i>fuck</i> the gym.</p><p>She&rsquo;s halfway through both the episode and the ice cream when she gets a knock at the door. Must be her roommate Sawyer, coming back from his not-so-fancy dinner with his boyfriend, Longines. Yes, Longines. Like the watch company, yes. He gets that a lot. Not Sawyer, of course. Sawyer gets &ldquo;Tom&rdquo; jokes, because apparently everyone with the name Sawyer is of <i>course </i>related to the literary character himself. Emphasis on <i>character</i>.</p><p>Anyways.</p><p>She gets up to answer the door, adjusting her matching grey lounge top so that it covers her sports bra. Wouldn&rsquo;t want to flash her roommate, after all. She then opens the door, and her face lights up, first with confusion, then with euphoria. Because standing in front of her is her boyfriend, Daniel, who was <i>supposed</i> to be travelling for the next six months, but who is back, apparently. He has a stupid, goofy smile on his face, and he&rsquo;s holding a bouqet of flowers (hibiscuses, to be exact) and his Givenchy backpack. They smile at each other for a while, until she opens her mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;You even brought me my favorite flowers, you absolute fucking bastard.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hello to you too, babe.&rdquo;</p><p>And with that she tosses the flowers onto her counter, tugs his backpack and jacket off, and envelopes him in the tighest, organ-crushing hug that the world and Dan&rsquo;s body has ever experienced. She pulls back for a second, takes a good, long look at his face, and kisses him, long and hard. She eventually needs air, so she pulls back, and that&rsquo;s when her cocky boyfriend decides to open his mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;Never knew you missed me <i>that </i>much.&rdquo; She gives him a withering look, but then extinguishes it as she takes in his figure. He&rsquo;s lost weight, and he apparently got some new clothes while he was in America, because he&rsquo;s sporting new black jeans, a short sleeve shirt, and (this is the bougiest part) new Gucci sneakers.</p><p>&ldquo;I did miss you, Daniel. Why did you come back so soon? Thought you were on tour for another three months?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Got about two weeks of break, doll. Decided to spend that with m&rsquo; girl.&rdquo; She smiles widely at this, heart swelling with equal parts love and joy. Jesus, she loves this man so much. After another hug, this one slightly less body damaging that the last one, it&rsquo;s now his turn to examine her. There isn&rsquo;t much fabric between the two of them right now, and it&rsquo;s making something stir inside of him. No physical contact for three months does something to a guy, and seeing his girlfriend clad in a crop top and soft shorts, her underwear peeking out slightly, is making him more that a little bit&hellip;<i>excited</i>.</p><p>He&rsquo;s silent as he thinks this over, and she gives him a concerned look. &ldquo;You good, Dan?&rdquo; He nods his head yes, but she can see the look in his eyes. They know each other too well, Dan and his girlfriend, and she knows when he&rsquo;s starting to get aroused. She smirks, and puts her hand on his chin, tipping it up so they&rsquo;re making eye contact. &ldquo;Missed me, didn'tcha?&rdquo; He nods his head yes, biting his lip subconsciously. &ldquo;You wanna&hellip;show me how much you did?&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes darken, and he turns the two of them around so that she&rsquo;s pressed against the wall. He kicks the door shut, and brings his mouth down to her ear.</p><p>&ldquo;Anyone in the house?&rdquo; She shakes her head no, and Dan pouts playfully. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a shame, really.&rdquo; He continues whispering in her ear as his hand trace circles on her exposed, flat stomach. &ldquo;Would&rsquo;ve enjoyed fucking you in front of your friends. Have them watch. Listen to the way I make you moan. Make you come, right here in front of all of &lsquo;em. Everyone&rsquo;ll know. I want them to know.&rdquo; She shudders slightly at his words. God, she missed this. &ldquo;I can see it in your eyes,&rdquo; he continues.</p><p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she interrupts him. &ldquo;That you would say just about anything to get laid.&rdquo; He nods in agreement, cocking his head at her as he brushes a stand of hair behind her ear.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not wrong.&rdquo; His breath smells like candy. She has no time to revel in the sweet smell of him (candy mixed with his cologne), because his lips, albeit chapped, are on hers, and her legs shake slightly at the intensity of his kiss. Seeing as she hasn&rsquo;t been like this with him for a quarter of a year, it&rsquo;s understandable. She bites his lips, causing a low grunt to escape his throat. He takes this as a cue to move down to her neck, sucking, nipping, and kissing down the side. He goes for the spot that always gets her to melt, and plays her like a piano. A sqeak of delight exits her mouth, and her acrylic nails dig into his exposed arms. </p><p>Speaking of his arms, he decides to put them to use. He uses one to tug off her top, another one to practically rip off her shorts, and then decides to split his arms. His right arm hooks around her, grabbling onto her hip, squeezing so hard that she&rsquo;s positive she&rsquo;ll have finger marks on her tomorrow. The other one, however travels into her underwear, earning a gasp from the girl. He lazily flicks her clit, earning another gasp from the girl. He flicks it with his thumb, and runs his middle finger down her slit. Well, she&rsquo;s not just wet. She&rsquo;s soaked. Soaked, so much so that her juices are smeared messily on the insides of her thighs, all over her smooth, soft mound and all over his two fingers. </p><p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; she groans softly. <i>Wow</i>, Daniel thinks. His ego inflates, as it always does when she begs, and he grips her hip tighter, and leans in for another kiss. As their lips meet, his middle and index fingers enter her, making her moan into his mouth. That&rsquo;s his prize, and a confirmation that he hasn&rsquo;t lost his touch.</p><p>Her back arches off the wall when he curls his fingers inside of her, and holy fucking Christ she looks so hot right now. He hair, once brushed and neat, is now tangled, messy and wild. Her body, once dry and clean, is now coated in a paper thin layer of sweat as she grinds down onto his fingers in an attempt to induce more pleasure. And it&rsquo;s so filthy, <i>she&rsquo;s</i> so filthy, and his fingers are coated in her, and he doesn&rsquo;t remember the last time she looked so utterly, irrevocably <i>his</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he teases, lips on her shoulder now. He listens to her breath hitch with every movement he makes, spellbound. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you get your rocks off while I was gone, hm?&rdquo;</p><p>Her laugh is mixed in with a series of gasps and moans. &ldquo;What, like I don&rsquo;t have fingers too?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Touch\u00e9,&rdquo; he chuckles, taking his thumb to her clit, working the little bundle of nerve endings back and forth leisurely, in time with his fingers&rsquo; thrusts. &ldquo;Ever think about me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Her voice is almost a scoff. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the only person I ever think about \u2013 oh, fuck&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Sooner rather than later, he can feel her walls clench, and he leans down yet again to whisper in her ear.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, babe&hellip;you wanna come? You want me to make you come, is that it? Okay, come for me, good girl, yeah, that&rsquo;s it. Feels so good, doesn&rsquo;t it? God, you look so hot right now. Say my name now, baby, that&rsquo;s it&hellip;so hot.&rdquo; </p><p>He says this into her ear, biting at her earlobe. She&rsquo;s so close to release, and he thrusts his fingers into her faster, pumping in and out of her, until finally, she releases a loud moan of his name, tugs his hair, and lets go, all over his hand. He can feel her legs go weak, and he uses the hand that was on her hip to support her as pleasure overtakes her. He helps her ride out her orgasm, and soon she leans against the wall, breathless, sweating, shaky but smiling. She pushes her hair to one side, and gives him a tired smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Jesus, I missed that. And you. So much, good God.&rdquo; He gives her a lopsided smirk at this. &ldquo;You want me to help you get your stuff from your place?&rdquo; His eyes darken, and he snakes his arms around her waist, making sure that his hardness brushes against her.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, for now&hellip;&rdquo; Dan drifts off suggestively, tracing a finger across her lips and then probing between them. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll just settle for some reciprocity.&rdquo;</p><p>She doesn&rsquo;t have to be asked twice. 'Reciprocity&rsquo; is her goddamn middle name, especially after that, and so in a matter of seconds she has flipped their positions, pressing him against the wall and rolling her hips on his. This time it was his time to gasp, and she takes that as confirmation that she is good at what she does. Namely, getting her boyfriend off. She sinks to her knees, tugging his belt, pants and boxer briefs off. </p><p>At the sight of his girlfriend on her knees, licking her lips again, sizing him up with undeniably hungry eyes&hellip;Christ, Dan could almost come from that alone. It&rsquo;s his every filthy fantasy come to life. It&rsquo;s everything he&rsquo;s ever wanted and more.</p><p>She starts off slow, kissing his tip, and slowly taking him into her mouth, sucking lightly. Seeing him tense up, she then changes pace rapidly, sucking rapidly, her mouth pumping around his length, making his breath catch in him, a throaty moan leaving his, well, <i>throat</i>. His hand finds its way to the back of her head, and pushes her down into him, fisting his hands in her hair, forcing her deeper, deeper, deeper onto him. She moans around him, sending waves of pure ecstacy down his body.</p><p>Soon, he&rsquo;s at the brink of coming. Is it a little soon? Sure. But who can blame him for finishing early? He&rsquo;s been away without any sex for three whole months, and this is the first time his dick has come into contact with her mouth since the day he left to travel the world. </p><p>As he begins to tense up, moaning louder and louder, she pulls back with a pop, removing her lips and illiciting a groan of confusion from the tall man above her.</p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come. On me. Come on me,&rdquo; she pants. She say it like it&rsquo;s an order, and that \u2013 the sight of her on her knees, eyes wide, telling him to come on her, all over her \u2013 is what finally sends him reeling.</p><p>She strokes him through it, as he lands in hot streams on her neck, breasts, collarbone \u2013 even on her chin and lips, which she licks clean like she can&rsquo;t get enough of his taste, and fucking hell, the sight only makes him come harder. It&rsquo;s so different than finishing in her mouth; wild, untamed, messy as hell, and hot. So unimaginably hot he almost doesn&rsquo;t remember to breathe.</p><p>He finishes, and sinks to the floor beside her. They make eye contact, and laughs shortly. She gets up, drags him to the couch in front of the TV, and collapses on the furniture, pulling him down with her. They lay next to each other silently for a while, until she speaks yet again.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talented,&rdquo; she remarks, reaching next to her and lacing her fingers through his, playing with them idly. &ldquo;Good with your hands. Big fingers. Put that on a resume.&rdquo;</p><p>He laughs softly, and leans into her.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll mention it during the next YouTube advert shoot. Do we have to move from here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We can stay here for as long as you&rsquo;d like.&rdquo;</p>",

'Reciprocity\u2019 is her goddamn middle name, especially after that, and so in a matter of seconds she has flipped their positions, pressing him against the wall and rolling her hips on his. This time it was his time to gasp, and she takes that as confirmation that she is good at what she does. Namely, getting her boyfriend off. She sinks to her knees, tugging his belt, pants and boxer briefs off. </p><p>At the sight of his girlfriend on her knees, licking her lips again, sizing him up with undeniably hungry eyes\u2026Christ, Dan could almost come from that alone. It\u2019s his every filthy fantasy come to life. It\u2019s everything he\u2019s ever wanted and more.</p><p>She starts off slow, kissing his tip, and slowly taking him into her mouth, sucking lightly. Seeing him tense up, she then changes pace rapidly, sucking rapidly, her mouth pumping around his length, making his breath catch in him, a throaty moan leaving his, well, <i>throat</i>. His hand finds its way to the back of her head, and pushes her down into him, fisting his hands in her hair, forcing her deeper, deeper, deeper onto him. She moans around him, sending waves of pure ecstacy down his body.</p><p>Soon, he\u2019s at the brink of coming. Is it a little soon? Sure. But who can blame him for finishing early? He\u2019s been away without any sex for three whole months, and this is the first time his dick has come into contact with her mouth since the day he left to travel the world. </p><p>As he begins to tense up, moaning louder and louder, she pulls back with a pop, removing her lips and illiciting a groan of confusion from the tall man above her.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome. On me. Come on me,\u201d she pants. She say it like it\u2019s an order, and that \u2013 the sight of her on her knees, eyes wide, telling him to come on her, all over her \u2013 is what finally sends him reeling.</p><p>She strokes him through it, as he lands in hot streams on her neck, breasts, collarbone \u2013 even on her chin and lips, which she licks clean like she can\u2019t get enough of his taste, and fucking hell, the sight only makes him come harder. It\u2019s so different than finishing in her mouth; wild, untamed, messy as hell, and hot. So unimaginably hot he almost doesn\u2019t remember to breathe.</p><p>He finishes, and sinks to the floor beside her. They make eye contact, and laughs shortly. She gets up, drags him to the couch in front of the TV, and collapses on the furniture, pulling him down with her. They lay next to each other silently for a while, until she speaks yet again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talented,\u201d she remarks, reaching next to her and lacing her fingers through his, playing with them idly. \u201cGood with your hands. Big fingers. Put that on a resume.\u201d</p><p>He laughs softly, and leans into her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll mention it during the next YouTube advert shoot. Do we have to move from here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can stay here for as long as you\u2019d like.\u201d</p>",

That leaves her, in her London apartment, watching <i>Black Mirror</i> with a pint of ice cream, because when you\u2019re lonely, self care and healthy eating goes out the fucking window. She\u2019s sitting in her lounge shorts and Calvin Klein underwear. This fashion choice counteracts the muggy weather that comes along with summer. And the ice cream counteracts her gym workout, because, honestly, <i>fuck</i> the gym.</p><p>She\u2019s halfway through both the episode and the ice cream when she gets a knock at the door. Must be her roommate Sawyer, coming back from his not-so-fancy dinner with his boyfriend, Longines. Yes, Longines. Like the watch company, yes. He gets that a lot. Not Sawyer, of course. Sawyer gets \u201cTom\u201d jokes, because apparently everyone with the name Sawyer is of <i>course </i>related to the literary character himself. Emphasis on <i>character</i>.</p><p>Anyways.</p><p>She gets up to answer the door, adjusting her matching grey lounge top so that it covers her sports bra. Wouldn\u2019t want to flash her roommate, after all. She then opens the door, and her face lights up, first with confusion, then with euphoria. Because standing in front of her is her boyfriend, Daniel, who was <i>supposed</i> to be travelling for the next six months, but who is back, apparently. He has a stupid, goofy smile on his face, and he\u2019s holding a bouqet of flowers (hibiscuses, to be exact) and his Givenchy backpack. They smile at each other for a while, until she opens her mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou even brought me my favorite flowers, you absolute fucking bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello to you too, babe.\u201d</p><p>And with that she tosses the flowers onto her counter, tugs his backpack and jacket off, and envelopes him in the tighest, organ-crushing hug that the world and Dan\u2019s body has ever experienced. She pulls back for a second, takes a good, long look at his face, and kisses him, long and hard. She eventually needs air, so she pulls back, and that\u2019s when her cocky boyfriend decides to open his mouth.</p><p>\u201cNever knew you missed me <i>that </i>much.\u201d She gives him a withering look, but then extinguishes it as she takes in his figure. He\u2019s lost weight, and he apparently got some new clothes while he was in America, because he\u2019s sporting new black jeans, a short sleeve shirt, and (this is the bougiest part) new Gucci sneakers.</p><p>\u201cI did miss you, Daniel. Why did you come back so soon? Thought you were on tour for another three months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot about two weeks of break, doll. Decided to spend that with m\u2019 girl.\u201d She smiles widely at this, heart swelling with equal parts love and joy. Jesus, she loves this man so much. After another hug, this one slightly less body damaging that the last one, it\u2019s now his turn to examine her. There isn\u2019t much fabric between the two of them right now, and it\u2019s making something stir inside of him. No physical contact for three months does something to a guy, and seeing his girlfriend clad in a crop top and soft shorts, her underwear peeking out slightly, is making him more that a little bit\u2026<i>excited</i>.</p><p>He\u2019s silent as he thinks this over, and she gives him a concerned look. \u201cYou good, Dan?\u201d He nods his head yes, but she can see the look in his eyes. They know each other too well, Dan and his girlfriend, and she knows when he\u2019s starting to get aroused. She smirks, and puts her hand on his chin, tipping it up so they\u2019re making eye contact. \u201cMissed me, didn'tcha?\u201d He nods his head yes, biting his lip subconsciously. \u201cYou wanna\u2026show me how much you did?\u201d</p><p>His eyes darken, and he turns the two of them around so that she\u2019s pressed against the wall. He kicks the door shut, and brings his mouth down to her ear.</p><p>\u201cAnyone in the house?\u201d She shakes her head no, and Dan pouts playfully. \u201cThat\u2019s a shame, really.\u201d He continues whispering in her ear as his hand trace circles on her exposed, flat stomach. \u201cWould\u2019ve enjoyed fucking you in front of your friends. Have them watch. Listen to the way I make you moan. Make you come, right here in front of all of \u2018em. Everyone\u2019ll know. I want them to know.\u201d She shudders slightly at his words. God, she missed this. \u201cI can see it in your eyes,\u201d he continues.</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d she interrupts him. \u201cThat you would say just about anything to get laid.\u201d He nods in agreement, cocking his head at her as he brushes a stand of hair behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong.\u201d His breath smells like candy. She has no time to revel in the sweet smell of him (candy mixed with his cologne), because his lips, albeit chapped, are on hers, and her legs shake slightly at the intensity of his kiss. Seeing as she hasn\u2019t been like this with him for a quarter of a year, it\u2019s understandable. She bites his lips, causing a low grunt to escape his throat. He takes this as a cue to move down to her neck, sucking, nipping, and kissing down the side. He goes for the spot that always gets her to melt, and plays her like a piano. A sqeak of delight exits her mouth, and her acrylic nails dig into his exposed arms. </p><p>Speaking of his arms, he decides to put them to use. He uses one to tug off her top, another one to practically rip off her shorts, and then decides to split his arms. His right arm hooks around her, grabbling onto her hip, squeezing so hard that she\u2019s positive she\u2019ll have finger marks on her tomorrow. The other one, however travels into her underwear, earning a gasp from the girl. He lazily flicks her clit, earning another gasp from the girl. He flicks it with his thumb, and runs his middle finger down her slit. Well, she\u2019s not just wet. She\u2019s soaked. Soaked, so much so that her juices are smeared messily on the insides of her thighs, all over her smooth, soft mound and all over his two fingers. </p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she groans softly. <i>Wow</i>, Daniel thinks. His ego inflates, as it always does when she begs, and he grips her hip tighter, and leans in for another kiss. As their lips meet, his middle and index fingers enter her, making her moan into his mouth. That\u2019s his prize, and a confirmation that he hasn\u2019t lost his touch.</p><p>Her back arches off the wall when he curls his fingers inside of her, and holy fucking Christ she looks so hot right now. He hair, once brushed and neat, is now tangled, messy and wild. Her body, once dry and clean, is now coated in a paper thin layer of sweat as she grinds down onto his fingers in an attempt to induce more pleasure. And it\u2019s so filthy, <i>she\u2019s</i> so filthy, and his fingers are coated in her, and he doesn\u2019t remember the last time she looked so utterly, irrevocably <i>his</i>.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he teases, lips on her shoulder now. He listens to her breath hitch with every movement he makes, spellbound. \u201cHow\u2019d you get your rocks off while I was gone, hm?\u201d</p><p>Her laugh is mixed in with a series of gasps and moans. \u201cWhat, like I don\u2019t have fingers too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9,\u201d he chuckles, taking his thumb to her clit, working the little bundle of nerve endings back and forth leisurely, in time with his fingers\u2019 thrusts. \u201cEver think about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Her voice is almost a scoff. \u201cYou\u2019re the only person I ever think about \u2013 oh, fuck\u2026\u201d</p><p>Sooner rather than later, he can feel her walls clench, and he leans down yet again to whisper in her ear.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, babe\u2026you wanna come? You want me to make you come, is that it? Okay, come for me, good girl, yeah, that\u2019s it. Feels so good, doesn\u2019t it? God, you look so hot right now. Say my name now, baby, that\u2019s it\u2026so hot.\u201d </p><p>He says this into her ear, biting at her earlobe. She\u2019s so close to release, and he thrusts his fingers into her faster, pumping in and out of her, until finally, she releases a loud moan of his name, tugs his hair, and lets go, all over his hand. He can feel her legs go weak, and he uses the hand that was on her hip to support her as pleasure overtakes her. He helps her ride out her orgasm, and soon she leans against the wall, breathless, sweating, shaky but smiling. She pushes her hair to one side, and gives him a tired smile.</p><p>\u201cJesus, I missed that. And you. So much, good God.\u201d He gives her a lopsided smirk at this. \u201cYou want me to help you get your stuff from your place?\u201d His eyes darken, and he snakes his arms around her waist, making sure that his hardness brushes against her.</p><p>\u201cWell, for now\u2026\u201d Dan drifts off suggestively, tracing a finger across her lips and then probing between them. \u201cI think I\u2019ll just settle for some reciprocity.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t have to be asked twice.

And it&rsquo;s so filthy, <i>she&rsquo;s</i> so filthy, and his fingers are coated in her, and he doesn&rsquo;t remember the last time she looked so utterly, irrevocably <i>his</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he teases, lips on her shoulder now. He listens to her breath hitch with every movement he makes, spellbound. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you get your rocks off while I was gone, hm?&rdquo;</p><p>Her laugh is mixed in with a series of gasps and moans. &ldquo;What, like I don&rsquo;t have fingers too?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Touch&eacute;,&rdquo; he chuckles, taking his thumb to her clit, working the little bundle of nerve endings back and forth leisurely, in time with his fingers&rsquo; thrusts. &ldquo;Ever think about me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Her voice is almost a scoff. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the only person I ever think about &ndash; oh, fuck&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Sooner rather than later, he can feel her walls clench, and he leans down yet again to whisper in her ear.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, babe&hellip;you wanna come? You want me to make you come, is that it? Okay, come for me, good girl, yeah, that&rsquo;s it. Feels so good, doesn&rsquo;t it? God, you look so hot right now. Say my name now, baby, that&rsquo;s it&hellip;so hot.&rdquo; </p><p>He says this into her ear, biting at her earlobe. She&rsquo;s so close to release, and he thrusts his fingers into her faster, pumping in and out of her, until finally, she releases a loud moan of his name, tugs his hair, and lets go, all over his hand. He can feel her legs go weak, and he uses the hand that was on her hip to support her as pleasure overtakes her. He helps her ride out her orgasm, and soon she leans against the wall, breathless, sweating, shaky but smiling. She pushes her hair to one side, and gives him a tired smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Jesus, I missed that. And you. So much, good God.&rdquo; He gives her a lopsided smirk at this. &ldquo;You want me to help you get your stuff from your place?&rdquo; His eyes darken, and he snakes his arms around her waist, making sure that his hardness brushes against her.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, for now&hellip;&rdquo; Dan drifts off suggestively, tracing a finger across her lips and then probing between them. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll just settle for some reciprocity.&rdquo;</p><p>She doesn&rsquo;t have to be asked twice. 'Reciprocity&rsquo; is her goddamn middle name, especially after that, and so in a matter of seconds she has flipped their positions, pressing him against the wall and rolling her hips on his. This time it was his time to gasp, and she takes that as confirmation that she is good at what she does. Namely, getting her boyfriend off. She sinks to her knees, tugging his belt, pants and boxer briefs off. </p><p>At the sight of his girlfriend on her knees, licking her lips again, sizing him up with undeniably hungry eyes&hellip;Christ, Dan could almost come from that alone. It&rsquo;s his every filthy fantasy come to life. It&rsquo;s everything he&rsquo;s ever wanted and more.</p><p>She starts off slow, kissing his tip, and slowly taking him into her mouth, sucking lightly. Seeing him tense up, she then changes pace rapidly, sucking rapidly, her mouth pumping around his length, making his breath catch in him, a throaty moan leaving his, well, <i>throat</i>. His hand finds its way to the back of her head, and pushes her down into him, fisting his hands in her hair, forcing her deeper, deeper, deeper onto him. She moans around him, sending waves of pure ecstacy down his body.</p><p>Soon, he&rsquo;s at the brink of coming. Is it a little soon? Sure. But who can blame him for finishing early? He&rsquo;s been away without any sex for three whole months, and this is the first time his dick has come into contact with her mouth since the day he left to travel the world. </p><p>As he begins to tense up, moaning louder and louder, she pulls back with a pop, removing her lips and illiciting a groan of confusion from the tall man above her.</p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come. On me. Come on me,&rdquo; she pants. She say it like it&rsquo;s an order, and that &ndash; the sight of her on her knees, eyes wide, telling him to come on her, all over her &ndash; is what finally sends him reeling.</p><p>She strokes him through it, as he lands in hot streams on her neck, breasts, collarbone &ndash; even on her chin and lips, which she licks clean like she can&rsquo;t get enough of his taste, and fucking hell, the sight only makes him come harder. It&rsquo;s so different than finishing in her mouth; wild, untamed, messy as hell, and hot. So unimaginably hot he almost doesn&rsquo;t remember to breathe.</p><p>He finishes, and sinks to the floor beside her. They make eye contact, and laughs shortly. She gets up, drags him to the couch in front of the TV, and collapses on the furniture, pulling him down with her. They lay next to each other silently for a while, until she speaks yet again.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talented,&rdquo; she remarks, reaching next to her and lacing her fingers through his, playing with them idly. &ldquo;Good with your hands. Big fingers. Put that on a resume.&rdquo;</p><p>He laughs softly, and leans into her.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll mention it during the next YouTube advert shoot. Do we have to move from here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We can stay here for as long as you&rsquo;d like.&rdquo;</p>",
