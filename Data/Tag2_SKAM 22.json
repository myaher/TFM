        "answer": "<p>Ahhh yeah they would both attract attention, I guess, but Eliott has more experience going out and recognizing it and putting a stop to it. Lucas is a lot more oblivious. Or well, that&rsquo;s what Eliott thinks at first, when they both get to uni and start going out more regularly. </p><p>But after a while, Eliott starts wondering if Lucas isn&rsquo;t doing it a tiny bit on purpose, the little shit. I mean, he must know that the way the guy is leaning towards him now, isn&rsquo;t completely innocent. And he knows how Eliott gets - possessive as hell, and more than a little bit rude. For instance, like right now, where he cuts right through their conversation to sling an arm around his shoulder and engage him in a very passionate, overly demonstrative kiss before turning to the guy and asking to the guy &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, have we been introduced ?&rdquo; Lucas looks supremely unbothered as he says Eliott is his boyfriend,  and Eliott couldn&rsquo;t care less about the other guy, especially not when Lucas smirks and asks &ldquo;where have you been baby ?&rdquo; and Eliott can&rsquo;t help but take him by the hand and drag him to the bathroom. </p><p>Deep down, they trust each other absolutely. But, well. He knows Lucas&rsquo; abandonment issues will always be part of him, that he likes it when Eliott gets a little bit possessive, a little bit intent on showing the world Lucas is his. He likes to see how incapable Eliott is of containing his annoyance when anyone pretends to be worthy of Lucas&rsquo;s attention. And he knows, too (because Lucas whispered it in his ear once late at night) that Lucas likes when he isn&rsquo;t ashamed of what he wants and who he wants. Also, he finds it funny, how rude Eliott gets. So, even though he would never dream of seeing Lucas as a thing to be owned, (and sometimes he knows that it&rsquo;s time for a conversation instead) sometimes, they play little games like these. In the end, it all boils down to an affirmation of the same thing : that nothing can take them apart. </p>",

And when I say nice, I mean really nice, really, really nice, like \u2018I could stare at them for days on end and never get bored\u2019 nice, or \u2018I could turn this one essay into an entire book\u2019 nice. <br/></p><p> However! at first I didn\u2019t notice them. Like many of us, Maxence/Eliott drew me in, Elite Mannequin etc. etc. and his hands too, with the rings, veins n all, and Lucas agrees with me, like, hardcore agrees with me. <br/></p><p>But when I did notice, my eyes started immediately gravitating towards his hands in any picture of him, it was like some kind of weird, \u2018Axel Auriant\u2019s hands\u2019 sixth sense.<br/></p><p>Going in deeper on just hands in general, but they can truly be the way into someones soul. They can tell so much about someone; what kind of work they do, they\u2019re personality and how much effort they put into their own appearance. They can tell nervous ticks and how people expel excess energy; do they pick at hang nails\n?\n\nchew their finger nails\n?\n\nbite at the skin around their nail bed\n?\n\nSome people might think palm reading is a bunch of nonsense, but even if there isn\u2019t coherent, readable meaning, someones life story is still told through the lines in their hands. Heartbreaks, first kisses, first fights, cooking burns, cat scratches, scars, first jobs, grief, its all there. And even if we can\u2019t read them like we can read a book, we can still get a sense of the person themselves. Humans are tactile animals, and our hands are our main tools in everything we do.</p><p>I\u2019m not gonna try and pretend I can read hands in any way at all, and I\u2019ve only seen his hands in pictures and videos, but while we always joke about Axel\u2019s chaotic, crackhead energy, in just a beautiful contrast, his hands seem so steady and calming. And he seems to use them as calming forces too, a hand on Maxence\u2019s shoulder at the panels or the projections, rubbing and patting fans backs during hugs, and even running his hands through his own hair(I see that energy burning tick Axel, and same man. my hands are always fucking around with my hair too).</p><p>In Mercredi 13:38, his fingertips lightly grazing up and down Eliott\u2019s arm, tracing the veins - we\u2019ve all talked about the eye-acting Axel and Maxence are capable of, and it is amazing - but the <i>hand </i>acting going on in that clip(and a whole bunch of other clips), is just astounding. The amount of love you can feel, see even, he\u2019s pouring into Eliott, just through his fingertips, with those gentle touches and caresses is truly breathtaking. <br/></p><p>Just to get superficial for a second here, his hands are just plain Hot. Or handsome. Or gorgeous, or whichever word you wanna use, they all fit. In a bunch of fics, people always describe Lucas hands(which are also Axel\u2019s hands) as being smaller, dainty, (its lowkey creepy sometimes, like the overuse of \u2018the younger adolescent\u2019 or \u2018the smaller youth\u2019 not calling anyone out, just warning against the overuse of the phrases) but its also just straight up not true. They\u2019re not massive hands with big sausage fingers - their still masculine - but they hold onto their prettiness. They\u2019re how I always imagined \u2018piano fingers\u2019 to look like. Long, but not spidery, thin but not fragile, knobbier knuckles, but not to an extent where his fingers look unbalanced. Not to be up his ass, but they\u2019re kinda perfect. <br/></p><p>I never thought I\u2019d get to this point, but here we are, I\u2019m about to wax poetic about Axel\u2019s thumbs. SO, in the very first clip of the season(excluding the trailer, where we get a close up of Maxence\u2019s hand), around the 47 second mark, there\u2019s like, a whole sequence of mainly his fingers, heavily featuring his thumb, and its weirdly pretty. Like you don\u2019t go about life thinking, huh, that person has really pretty thumbs. Yet here I am, doing exactly that. not to get even weirder, but focusing in on his thumb <i>nail, </i>its like the perfect shape you imagine when you think of the word \u2018opal\u2019, a smooth, slightly squared, oval. <br/></p><p>I\u2019ve talked a whole lot about just his fingers, but now its time for the rest. He\u2019s got like, the prefect amount of veins popping out on the back oh his hand, and that bony little bit on the outsides of wrists\n? somehow he manages to perfect that as well(little protip, someone rubbing their finger over that spot is hella comforting). <br/></p><p>Going back to his hand motions and the way he uses them, he doesn\u2019t always talk with his hands, but when he does, its with \nsmaller gestures, controlled movements punctuating his words and meaning.\n\nLike with his words, his hand motions are filled with pure eloquence, with clear meaning and thought put into them.<br/></p><p>The way Lucas pulls Chloe closer to him in Samedi 22:15, I never noticed it until I rewatched a bunch of clips for this, but that shit was smooth. I\u2019ve always found watching peoples hands do little mundane things just completely entrancing, and the little movements and motions he\u2019s doing during that entire scene are just really fun to watch. Like the shotgunning with Chloe and his hand in between him, I know people were saying that was a dumb way to do it, but <i>hands</i>, and he also probably wanted to keep Chloe as far away as he could for as long as possible. <br/></p><p>\n(Just as some really quick, honorable mentions, in Samedi 22:15, Arthur\u2019s and Yann\u2019s hands are <i>nice. </i>Arthur holding his little cup all fancy-like, and Yann with his ring and the joint\n\n?\n\n\n?\n\nhot damn.)<br/></p><p>And even when Chloe was kissing him against the wall, when he was so uncomfortable, the way he touched the back of her head and neck still seemed so gentle, and almost regretful, bringing us right back up to Axel\u2019s hand acting I was talking about before, just the emotion he can pack into such small motions is truly impressive. <br/></p><p>Now, diving into Samedi 9:17 and trying to just focus on his hands and not get distracted by trying to watch the entire thing is a Task. In the first few seconds with them in the shot, there\u2019s already so much content to dissect. The way he\u2019s running his hand up Eliott\u2019s arm and onto his neck is a wonderful parallel to Mercredi 13:38, there he\u2019s calm, he knows he has Eliott, and he\u2019s familiar with him too. But in Samedi, he\u2019s desperate to feel him, to know and understand him, he\u2019s nervous and its all so new and exciting. And again, just as a purely superficial take on that shot, his hands(and arms) are so fucking good there. The veins\n\n\n?\n\nAmazing. Muscles\n\n\n?\n\nAmazing. Tendons\n\n\n?\n\nYeah, even those are hot too. It really is just unfair. <br/></p><p>Just a few seconds further into the scene, Lucas hands pulling Eliott\u2019s body closer to his, with his hand flat against Eliott\u2019s back, its magnetizing, like when he pulled Chloe closer to him in the party clip in the beginning of the season, which leads me to believe its not even intentional. Just something that exudes out of Axel, and in turn Lucas, naturally. <br/></p><p>It took a lot to not talk about every little thing he does with his hands in Samedi 9:17, but we\u2019re jumping ahead a little to when Lucas is propped up over Eliott. With his hands in Eliott\u2019s hair. Yeah, that shot with his hair in his face and Eliott gently flicks at it. I Die. That gentle scrunch of his fingers in Eliott\u2019s hair(oh look, return of the pretty thumb), it looks so soothing, and the little movements of his fingers while he waits for Eliott to talk\n\n\n?\n\nwaow, just kill me now. <br/></p><p>Btw, at this point, I\u2019m forcing myself to not launch into Eliott\u2019s hands rn(the way he\u2019s almost pawing at Lucas face around 2:16\n\n\n?\n\nyeah.), but they are busy and beautiful. just remember that.</p><p>I am.. Honestly kind of impressed that I wrote this much, I was expecting it to be harder, but to be fair, it is a very compelling subject. <br/></p>",

Like you don\u2019t go about life thinking, huh, that person has really pretty thumbs. Yet here I am, doing exactly that. not to get even weirder, but focusing in on his thumb <i>nail, </i>its like the perfect shape you imagine when you think of the word \u2018opal\u2019, a smooth, slightly squared, oval. <br></p><p>I\u2019ve talked a whole lot about just his fingers, but now its time for the rest. He\u2019s got like, the prefect amount of veins popping out on the back oh his hand, and that bony little bit on the outsides of wrists\n? somehow he manages to perfect that as well(little protip, someone rubbing their finger over that spot is hella comforting). <br></p><p>Going back to his hand motions and the way he uses them, he doesn\u2019t always talk with his hands, but when he does, its with \nsmaller gestures, controlled movements punctuating his words and meaning.\n\nLike with his words, his hand motions are filled with pure eloquence, with clear meaning and thought put into them.<br></p><p>The way Lucas pulls Chloe closer to him in Samedi 22:15, I never noticed it until I rewatched a bunch of clips for this, but that shit was smooth. I\u2019ve always found watching peoples hands do little mundane things just completely entrancing, and the little movements and motions he\u2019s doing during that entire scene are just really fun to watch. Like the shotgunning with Chloe and his hand in between him, I know people were saying that was a dumb way to do it, but <i>hands</i>, and he also probably wanted to keep Chloe as far away as he could for as long as possible. <br></p><p>\n(Just as some really quick, honorable mentions, in Samedi 22:15, Arthur\u2019s and Yann\u2019s hands are <i>nice. </i>Arthur holding his little cup all fancy-like, and Yann with his ring and the joint\n\n?\n\n\n?\n\nhot damn.)<br></p><p>And even when Chloe was kissing him against the wall, when he was so uncomfortable, the way he touched the back of her head and neck still seemed so gentle, and almost regretful, bringing us right back up to Axel\u2019s hand acting I was talking about before, just the emotion he can pack into such small motions is truly impressive. <br></p><p>Now, diving into Samedi 9:17 and trying to just focus on his hands and not get distracted by trying to watch the entire thing is a Task. In the first few seconds with them in the shot, there\u2019s already so much content to dissect. The way he\u2019s running his hand up Eliott\u2019s arm and onto his neck is a wonderful parallel to Mercredi 13:38, there he\u2019s calm, he knows he has Eliott, and he\u2019s familiar with him too. But in Samedi, he\u2019s desperate to feel him, to know and understand him, he\u2019s nervous and its all so new and exciting. And again, just as a purely superficial take on that shot, his hands(and arms) are so fucking good there. The veins\n\n\n?\n\nAmazing. Muscles\n\n\n?\n\nAmazing. Tendons\n\n\n?\n\nYeah, even those are hot too. It really is just unfair. <br></p><p>Just a few seconds further into the scene, Lucas hands pulling Eliott\u2019s body closer to his, with his hand flat against Eliott\u2019s back, its magnetizing, like when he pulled Chloe closer to him in the party clip in the beginning of the season, which leads me to believe its not even intentional. Just something that exudes out of Axel, and in turn Lucas, naturally. <br></p><p>It took a lot to not talk about every little thing he does with his hands in Samedi 9:17, but we\u2019re jumping ahead a little to when Lucas is propped up over Eliott. With his hands in Eliott\u2019s hair. Yeah, that shot with his hair in his face and Eliott gently flicks at it. I Die. That gentle scrunch of his fingers in Eliott\u2019s hair(oh look, return of the pretty thumb), it looks so soothing, and the little movements of his fingers while he waits for Eliott to talk\n\n\n?\n\nwaow, just kill me now. <br></p><p>Btw, at this point, I\u2019m forcing myself to not launch into Eliott\u2019s hands rn(the way he\u2019s almost pawing at Lucas face around 2:16\n\n\n?\n\nyeah.), but they are busy and beautiful. just remember that.</p><p>I am.. Honestly kind of impressed that I wrote this much, I was expecting it to be harder, but to be fair, it is a very compelling subject. <br></p>",

And when I say nice, I mean really nice, really, really nice, like \u2018I could stare at them for days on end and never get bored\u2019 nice, or \u2018I could turn this one essay into an entire book\u2019 nice. <br></p><p> However! at first I didn\u2019t notice them. Like many of us, Maxence/Eliott drew me in, Elite Mannequin etc. etc. and his hands too, with the rings, veins n all, and Lucas agrees with me, like, hardcore agrees with me. <br></p><p>But when I did notice, my eyes started immediately gravitating towards his hands in any picture of him, it was like some kind of weird, \u2018Axel Auriant\u2019s hands\u2019 sixth sense.<br></p><p>Going in deeper on just hands in general, but they can truly be the way into someones soul. They can tell so much about someone; what kind of work they do, they\u2019re personality and how much effort they put into their own appearance. They can tell nervous ticks and how people expel excess energy; do they pick at hang nails\n?\n\nchew their finger nails\n?\n\nbite at the skin around their nail bed\n?\n\nSome people might think palm reading is a bunch of nonsense, but even if there isn\u2019t coherent, readable meaning, someones life story is still told through the lines in their hands. Heartbreaks, first kisses, first fights, cooking burns, cat scratches, scars, first jobs, grief, its all there. And even if we can\u2019t read them like we can read a book, we can still get a sense of the person themselves. Humans are tactile animals, and our hands are our main tools in everything we do.</p><p>I\u2019m not gonna try and pretend I can read hands in any way at all, and I\u2019ve only seen his hands in pictures and videos, but while we always joke about Axel\u2019s chaotic, crackhead energy, in just a beautiful contrast, his hands seem so steady and calming. And he seems to use them as calming forces too, a hand on Maxence\u2019s shoulder at the panels or the projections, rubbing and patting fans backs during hugs, and even running his hands through his own hair(I see that energy burning tick Axel, and same man. my hands are always fucking around with my hair too).</p><p>In Mercredi 13:38, his fingertips lightly grazing up and down Eliott\u2019s arm, tracing the veins - we\u2019ve all talked about the eye-acting Axel and Maxence are capable of, and it is amazing - but the <i>hand </i>acting going on in that clip(and a whole bunch of other clips), is just astounding. The amount of love you can feel, see even, he\u2019s pouring into Eliott, just through his fingertips, with those gentle touches and caresses is truly breathtaking. <br></p><p>Just to get superficial for a second here, his hands are just plain Hot. Or handsome. Or gorgeous, or whichever word you wanna use, they all fit. In a bunch of fics, people always describe Lucas hands(which are also Axel\u2019s hands) as being smaller, dainty, (its lowkey creepy sometimes, like the overuse of \u2018the younger adolescent\u2019 or \u2018the smaller youth\u2019 not calling anyone out, just warning against the overuse of the phrases) but its also just straight up not true. They\u2019re not massive hands with big sausage fingers - their still masculine - but they hold onto their prettiness. They\u2019re how I always imagined \u2018piano fingers\u2019 to look like. Long, but not spidery, thin but not fragile, knobbier knuckles, but not to an extent where his fingers look unbalanced. Not to be up his ass, but they\u2019re kinda perfect. <br></p><p>I never thought I\u2019d get to this point, but here we are, I\u2019m about to wax poetic about Axel\u2019s thumbs.

        "question": "Elu carnival date, eliott wins Lucas a stuffed animal",
        "answer": "<p><b>Double Date</b></p><p>It was really Imane\u2019s fault, if Lucas was being honest. <i>She</i> was the one that had invited him and Eliott on a double date with her and Sofiane. She probably should have realized that it would turn into Eliott and Sofiane subtly trying to one-up the other for the title of \u2018best boyfriend\u2019. Usually Lucas was the competitive one, but it was fun to watch Eliott try so hard to prove something he really didn\u2019t need to prove. Lucas was fully aware that Eliott was the best boyfriend in the world, and he was sure Imane felt the same about Sofiane. It was all a matter of perspective. </p><p>\tNevertheless, Imane and Lucas had decided to play a little game, trying to see how far each of their boyfriends would go to prove they were the best without admitting that was what they were doing. Lucas was sure Sofiane would crack first, and even though she wouldn\u2019t admit it, he was pretty sure Imane was inclined to agree. </p><!-- more --><p>\tThey were at a carnival, so the opportunity to impress was endless. \u201cI\u2019m feeling a bit hungry, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Imane said to Lucas conversationally, knowing Sofiane would overhear. </p><p>\t\u201cHmm, a bit, yeah,\u201d he agreed, monitoring Eliott from the corner of his eye. Right now he was in a heated discussion with a kid carrying a raccoon stuffed animal. He wasn\u2019t sure what exactly they were talking about, but the kid and the kid\u2019s parents were looking at Eliott as if the sun shone out of his every pore. Lucas could relate. </p><p>\tSofiane returned a moment later with food for Imane and Lucas, grinning in Lucas could only assume was satisfaction as Eliott returned from his chat empty handed. It was hilarious to watch really, because Eliott and Sofiane were probably the only two people in the world that could accidentally make a competition out of being nice and thoughtful. He didn\u2019t know what it said about him and Imane that they had intentionally exploited this. </p><p>\u201cWhen did you guys get food?\u201d Eliott asked, and Lucas handed him some of the fries he was munching on to share. </p><p>\u201cOh, Sofiane got it for us,\u201d Imane explained, looking pointedly at Lucas. </p><p>Eliott bounced a bit on his toes, smiling. \u201cSorry! I would have if I hadn\u2019t been talking to my new best friend,\u201d he grinned. </p><p>\u201cNew best friend?\u201d Lucas laughed.</p><p>Eliott gestured to the kid and his parents still standing together a few feet away. \u201cRaccoons are his spirit animal too, so I promised him a raccoon drawing before he leaves,\u201d Eliott explained. \u201cWhich reminds me\u2026\u201d</p><p>He pulled out a pen and a scrap of paper from his pocket, bending down to use his knee as a surface to draw. Lucas watched him fondly before looking at Imane smugly. <i>Best boyfriend</i>, he told her with his smirk, <i>No competition necessary</i>. Imane wrinkled her nose at him, rolling her eyes, but he caught a hint of a smile on her face before she turned to talk to Sofiane.</p><p>Lucas glanced down at the drawing, smiling when he saw a big raccoon talking animatedly with a smaller raccoon, a hedgehog standing with a smile in the background. Eliott finished up some small details and held up the paper, locking eyes with the boy, whose entire face lit up as he grabbed his mother\u2019s hand and pulled her along with him to go meet Eliott. </p><p>\u201cTa-da!\u201d Eliott presented the drawing with a flourish, smiling as widely as the boy who took it with wide, bright eyes. </p><p>\u201cLook, mama! It\u2019s me and Eliott!\u201d he held the drawing up proudly to his mother. She looked at it then looked gratefully to Eliott. \u201cThat\u2019s beautiful,\u201d she said, \u201cNow what do we say to Eliott?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThank you Eliott!\u201d the boy exclaimed, pulling Eliott, still crouched down into as big a hug his tiny arms would allow. Joy was practically radiating off the both of them, so sweet Lucas could help but smile along. </p><p>Eliott laughed as the boy pulled away. \u201cAnything for my new best friend,\u201d he said matter-of-factly. </p><p>The boy widened his eyes, this time in alarm. \u201cI can\u2019t be your best friend! He\u2019s already your best friend!\u201d</p><p>Lucas blinked in shock, stunned to have been addressed. Eliott shook his head. \u201cNo, he\u2019s not my best friend, he has a best friend of his own. He\u2019s just the love of my life.\u201d </p><p>Lucas coughed and looked away to hide his blush, catching the kid\u2019s mother\u2019s eye accidentally. She was smiling at him in a knowing way, which made him blush even further. The kid leaned in to whisper to Eliott, at a volume that wasn\u2019t much of a whisper at all, \u201cYou\u2019re married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Eliott whispered back conspiratorially. He looked up at Lucas, smiling. \u201cSomeday, though.\u201d</p><p>The boy let out a giggle of excitement. \u201cDo I get to come to the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Eliott scoffed. \u201cWho else would be my best man?\u201d</p><p>The boy giggled happily once more, turning to ask his mom. \u201cWhat\u2019s a best man?\u201d</p><p>She simply smiled and ruffled his hair, addressing Eliott. \u201cThank you, Eliott, you don\u2019t know how much this means to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Eliott said, straightening up, \u201cI\u2019m always willing to befriend a fellow raccoon appreciator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll let the two of you carry on with you day now,\u201d she said, patting Eliott softly on the shoulder and looking between the two of them before grabbing back onto her son\u2019s hand and beginning to lead him away. \u201cIt was nice to meet you, Eliott, and you as well\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas,\u201d he answered, surprised he was able to speak at all. </p><p>\u201cAnd you as well, Lucas. I expect an invite to the wedding,\u201d she said with a smile over her shoulder as she walked away. Eliott laughed and slung an arm around Lucas\u2019 shoulders, corners of his eyes creasing in the way that Lucas loved. </p><p>Lucas caught Imane\u2019s eye behind him and shrugged as imperceptibly as possible. He was pretty sure Eliott was miles ahead of Sofiane at this point. She grimaced at him, calculating look in her eyes before stomping away, knowing they would all follow. </p><p>\u201cIs everything ok with Imane?\u201d Eliott asked seriously, and Lucas just laughed. </p><p>\u201cYeah, everything\u2019s fine,\u201d he reassured him, following Imane and Sofiane. She wasn\u2019t much for public affection, but Lucas smiled as he saw her fingers brush against Sofiane\u2019s in a way he was sure was intentional.</p><p>They stopped in front of the ferris wheel and Lucas glared at her. She knew damn well he was afraid of heights and would rather eat dirt than ride this giant death trap. The problem was, Eliott didn\u2019t know this. </p><p>Sofiane and Imane exchanged their tickets and got on a seat, Eliott making way to follow them, but Lucas pulled his arm and held him back last minute, shaking his head. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy no?\u201d</p><p>Lucas bit his lip. \u201cHeights. Not a fan.\u201d</p><p>Eliott laughed, then tried to stop laughing when he noticed Lucas\u2019 glare. \u201cSorry, sorry. I\u2019m not laughing at you\u2026 well, yeah, I kind of am, but just because I think it\u2019s cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Bleh, bleh, bleh I think it\u2019s cute,</i>\u201d Lucas mocked, and Eliott laughed harder, pulling Lucas to him and tucking his head into his neck. </p><p>\u201cAfraid of the dark and heights\u2026\u201d Eliott said when he pulled away, \u201cHow clich\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off, I told you I\u2019m not afraid of the dark!\u201d Lucas laughed, hitting Eliott\u2019s arm playfully. He glanced up to where Sofiane and Imane were gazing into each other\u2019s eyes at the top of the ferris wheel, a scene straight out of a movie. Fine, she won this round, though he could argue it was equally romantic that Eliott hadn\u2019t made him ride the ferris wheel if he was scared. Of course, the argument wouldn\u2019t be of much value due to the fact that Eliott was teasing him about it.</p><p>Lucas slid his hand down the length of Eliott\u2019s arm before joining their fingers together and resting his head against Eliott\u2019s arm. Eliott looked down at him curiously and Lucas rolled his eyes with a smile. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Eliott said, leaning down to kiss the top of his head.</p><p>When Sofiane and Imane got off the ferris wheel, Sofiane looked more lovestruck than usual and Imane sported a satisfied grin. \u201cWhere to next?\u201d she asked, and Lucas lit up with an idea. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s play carnival games,\u201d he suggested, pulling Eliott along by the hand. Once they\u2019re deep into the center of the fair, Lucas\u2019 gaze rested on his ticket to victory. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>It was giant, it was a plush hedgehog, and it was absolutely certain that Eliott would do everything in his power to win it for Lucas. Once Eliott won it for him, Sofiane would have to try to do something to top it, and there was no way in hell Imane was walking out of that carnival with a giant stuffed animal, competition or not. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cEliott, look,\u201d he said casually, pointing out the stuffed hedgehog. He watched Imane follow his gaze and watched as realization dawned on her face. Victory had never tasted better. Eliott\u2019s eyes lit up when he saw the prize, not even waiting for Lucas before going up to the booth and handing over tickets in exchange for a turn at the task, knocking over a few bottles all stacked on top of one another. </p><p>\u201cHow many do I have to knock over to win that hedgehog?\u201d Eliott asked, nodding at the animal. The man running the booth shrugged lazily. </p><p>\u201cAll of them?\u201d he sighed, clearly wishing he were anywhere else. Eliott nodded solemnly, brows furrowing in concentration. Lucas couldn\u2019t help but laugh at his boyfriend\u2019s serious nature so out of place from his natural demeanor. </p><p>Eliott wound up his arm, squinting his eyes to aim before throwing the ball, hitting at exactly the right spot, cheering as all the bottles fell. He picked up Lucas and spun him around once, much to the surprise of the disinterested man behind the booth. </p><p>\u201cDid you\u2026 want your prize?\u201d the man asked slowly, causing Eliott to drop Lucas and nod excitedly. \u201cYes, please,\u201d he said, pointing up at the hedgehog as if the man had forgotten. </p><p>Once he\u2019d retrieved it and handed it to Eliott, Eliott thanked him graciously and turned to Lucas, holding the stuffed animal behind his back. \u201cI have a surprise for you,\u201d Eliott said seriously. </p><p>\u201cAh, yeah?\u201d Lucas asked with a small giggle. Eliott nodded, waiting a moment to suspend the imagined tension before thrusting the hedgehog forward into Lucas\u2019 arms. </p><p>\u201cTa-da!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it!\u201d Lucas exclaimed, grabbing onto it and holding it close. He really did love it, competition or not. \u201cI\u2019ll cherish it forever.\u201d</p><p>Eliott\u2019s eyes crinkled and he leaned down to press a small kiss to Lucas\u2019 waiting lips, pulling away far too quickly in Lucas\u2019 opinion. Sofiane\u2019s voice broke him out of the love bubble he\u2019d succumbed to. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, how am I supposed to compete with that?\u201d he asked in exasperation. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Eliott asked, laughing slightly. </p><p>Sofiane leveled him with a stare that said <i>you know exactly what I\u2019m talking about</i>. \u201cFine, you win,\u201d he conceded, \u201cEliott is the best boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>Eliott continued to pretend he had no idea what Sofiane was talking about, but Lucas saw the victorious spark in his eyes. \u201cYou really are,\u201d Lucas said, hugging the hedgehog to his chest, trying his best to meet Eliott\u2019s eyes over the top of it. Eliott winked at him, a silly gesture that somehow still had his head spinning. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not so bad yourself,\u201d Imane shrugged, fingers holding onto one of Sofiane\u2019s hands loosely. Lucas raised his eyebrows at her, but she didn\u2019t notice, too busy smiling at Sofiane. Normally Lucas felt that there was a constant battle of vibrancy between Sofiane and Eliott\u2019s smiles, but the soft smile Imane was giving Sofiane right now easily surpassed the two of them. She was already one of the most beautiful people Lucas knew when she wasn\u2019t smiling like that, but her smile in that moment was something special to witness, even though he felt somewhat intrusive for looking.</p><p>\u201cAt least we know one thing for certain,\u201d Eliott said, draping an arm around Lucas\u2019 shoulders. Imane and Sofiane looked over at him quizzically. \u201cImane is the best girlfriend here,\u201d he continued, nudging Lucas\u2019 head with his own lightly. </p><p>Lucas looked up to meet Eliott\u2019s eyes. \u201cDork,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cThe <i>best</i> dork,\u201d Eliott corrected, and Lucas couldn\u2019t help but agree. He was so lucky to have this dork in his life.<br/></p>",

Right now he was in a heated discussion with a kid carrying a raccoon stuffed animal. He wasn\u2019t sure what exactly they were talking about, but the kid and the kid\u2019s parents were looking at Eliott as if the sun shone out of his every pore. Lucas could relate. </p><p>\tSofiane returned a moment later with food for Imane and Lucas, grinning in Lucas could only assume was satisfaction as Eliott returned from his chat empty handed. It was hilarious to watch really, because Eliott and Sofiane were probably the only two people in the world that could accidentally make a competition out of being nice and thoughtful. He didn\u2019t know what it said about him and Imane that they had intentionally exploited this. </p><p>\u201cWhen did you guys get food?\u201d Eliott asked, and Lucas handed him some of the fries he was munching on to share. </p><p>\u201cOh, Sofiane got it for us,\u201d Imane explained, looking pointedly at Lucas. </p><p>Eliott bounced a bit on his toes, smiling. \u201cSorry! I would have if I hadn\u2019t been talking to my new best friend,\u201d he grinned. </p><p>\u201cNew best friend?\u201d Lucas laughed.</p><p>Eliott gestured to the kid and his parents still standing together a few feet away. \u201cRaccoons are his spirit animal too, so I promised him a raccoon drawing before he leaves,\u201d Eliott explained. \u201cWhich reminds me\u2026\u201d</p><p>He pulled out a pen and a scrap of paper from his pocket, bending down to use his knee as a surface to draw.

She probably should have realized that it would turn into Eliott and Sofiane subtly trying to one-up the other for the title of \u2018best boyfriend\u2019. Usually Lucas was the competitive one, but it was fun to watch Eliott try so hard to prove something he really didn\u2019t need to prove. Lucas was fully aware that Eliott was the best boyfriend in the world, and he was sure Imane felt the same about Sofiane. It was all a matter of perspective. </p><p>\tNevertheless, Imane and Lucas had decided to play a little game, trying to see how far each of their boyfriends would go to prove they were the best without admitting that was what they were doing. Lucas was sure Sofiane would crack first, and even though she wouldn\u2019t admit it, he was pretty sure Imane was inclined to agree. </p>[[MORE]]<p>\tThey were at a carnival, so the opportunity to impress was endless. \u201cI\u2019m feeling a bit hungry, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Imane said to Lucas conversationally, knowing Sofiane would overhear. </p><p>\t\u201cHmm, a bit, yeah,\u201d he agreed, monitoring Eliott from the corner of his eye. Right now he was in a heated discussion with a kid carrying a raccoon stuffed animal. He wasn\u2019t sure what exactly they were talking about, but the kid and the kid\u2019s parents were looking at Eliott as if the sun shone out of his every pore. Lucas could relate. </p><p>\tSofiane returned a moment later with food for Imane and Lucas, grinning in Lucas could only assume was satisfaction as Eliott returned from his chat empty handed. It was hilarious to watch really, because Eliott and Sofiane were probably the only two people in the world that could accidentally make a competition out of being nice and thoughtful. He didn\u2019t know what it said about him and Imane that they had intentionally exploited this. </p><p>\u201cWhen did you guys get food?\u201d Eliott asked, and Lucas handed him some of the fries he was munching on to share. </p><p>\u201cOh, Sofiane got it for us,\u201d Imane explained, looking pointedly at Lucas. </p><p>Eliott bounced a bit on his toes, smiling. \u201cSorry! I would have if I hadn\u2019t been talking to my new best friend,\u201d he grinned. </p><p>\u201cNew best friend?\u201d Lucas laughed.</p><p>Eliott gestured to the kid and his parents still standing together a few feet away. \u201cRaccoons are his spirit animal too, so I promised him a raccoon drawing before he leaves,\u201d Eliott explained. \u201cWhich reminds me\u2026\u201d</p><p>He pulled out a pen and a scrap of paper from his pocket, bending down to use his knee as a surface to draw. Lucas watched him fondly before looking at Imane smugly. <i>Best boyfriend</i>, he told her with his smirk, <i>No competition necessary</i>. Imane wrinkled her nose at him, rolling her eyes, but he caught a hint of a smile on her face before she turned to talk to Sofiane.</p><p>Lucas glanced down at the drawing, smiling when he saw a big raccoon talking animatedly with a smaller raccoon, a hedgehog standing with a smile in the background. Eliott finished up some small details and held up the paper, locking eyes with the boy, whose entire face lit up as he grabbed his mother\u2019s hand and pulled her along with him to go meet Eliott. </p><p>\u201cTa-da!\u201d Eliott presented the drawing with a flourish, smiling as widely as the boy who took it with wide, bright eyes. </p><p>\u201cLook, mama! It\u2019s me and Eliott!\u201d he held the drawing up proudly to his mother. She looked at it then looked gratefully to Eliott. \u201cThat\u2019s beautiful,\u201d she said, \u201cNow what do we say to Eliott?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThank you Eliott!\u201d the boy exclaimed, pulling Eliott, still crouched down into as big a hug his tiny arms would allow. Joy was practically radiating off the both of them, so sweet Lucas could help but smile along. </p><p>Eliott laughed as the boy pulled away. \u201cAnything for my new best friend,\u201d he said matter-of-factly. </p><p>The boy widened his eyes, this time in alarm. \u201cI can\u2019t be your best friend! He\u2019s already your best friend!\u201d</p><p>Lucas blinked in shock, stunned to have been addressed. Eliott shook his head. \u201cNo, he\u2019s not my best friend, he has a best friend of his own. He\u2019s just the love of my life.\u201d </p><p>Lucas coughed and looked away to hide his blush, catching the kid\u2019s mother\u2019s eye accidentally. She was smiling at him in a knowing way, which made him blush even further. The kid leaned in to whisper to Eliott, at a volume that wasn\u2019t much of a whisper at all, \u201cYou\u2019re married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Eliott whispered back conspiratorially. He looked up at Lucas, smiling. \u201cSomeday, though.\u201d</p><p>The boy let out a giggle of excitement. \u201cDo I get to come to the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Eliott scoffed. \u201cWho else would be my best man?\u201d</p><p>The boy giggled happily once more, turning to ask his mom. \u201cWhat\u2019s a best man?\u201d</p><p>She simply smiled and ruffled his hair, addressing Eliott. \u201cThank you, Eliott, you don\u2019t know how much this means to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Eliott said, straightening up, \u201cI\u2019m always willing to befriend a fellow raccoon appreciator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll let the two of you carry on with you day now,\u201d she said, patting Eliott softly on the shoulder and looking between the two of them before grabbing back onto her son\u2019s hand and beginning to lead him away. \u201cIt was nice to meet you, Eliott, and you as well\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas,\u201d he answered, surprised he was able to speak at all. </p><p>\u201cAnd you as well, Lucas. I expect an invite to the wedding,\u201d she said with a smile over her shoulder as she walked away. Eliott laughed and slung an arm around Lucas\u2019 shoulders, corners of his eyes creasing in the way that Lucas loved. </p><p>Lucas caught Imane\u2019s eye behind him and shrugged as imperceptibly as possible. He was pretty sure Eliott was miles ahead of Sofiane at this point. She grimaced at him, calculating look in her eyes before stomping away, knowing they would all follow. </p><p>\u201cIs everything ok with Imane?\u201d Eliott asked seriously, and Lucas just laughed. </p><p>\u201cYeah, everything\u2019s fine,\u201d he reassured him, following Imane and Sofiane. She wasn\u2019t much for public affection, but Lucas smiled as he saw her fingers brush against Sofiane\u2019s in a way he was sure was intentional.</p><p>They stopped in front of the ferris wheel and Lucas glared at her. She knew damn well he was afraid of heights and would rather eat dirt than ride this giant death trap. The problem was, Eliott didn\u2019t know this. </p><p>Sofiane and Imane exchanged their tickets and got on a seat, Eliott making way to follow them, but Lucas pulled his arm and held him back last minute, shaking his head. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy no?\u201d</p><p>Lucas bit his lip. \u201cHeights. Not a fan.\u201d</p><p>Eliott laughed, then tried to stop laughing when he noticed Lucas\u2019 glare. \u201cSorry, sorry. I\u2019m not laughing at you\u2026 well, yeah, I kind of am, but just because I think it\u2019s cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Bleh, bleh, bleh I think it\u2019s cute,</i>\u201d Lucas mocked, and Eliott laughed harder, pulling Lucas to him and tucking his head into his neck. </p><p>\u201cAfraid of the dark and heights\u2026\u201d Eliott said when he pulled away, \u201cHow clich\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off, I told you I\u2019m not afraid of the dark!\u201d Lucas laughed, hitting Eliott\u2019s arm playfully. He glanced up to where Sofiane and Imane were gazing into each other\u2019s eyes at the top of the ferris wheel, a scene straight out of a movie. Fine, she won this round, though he could argue it was equally romantic that Eliott hadn\u2019t made him ride the ferris wheel if he was scared. Of course, the argument wouldn\u2019t be of much value due to the fact that Eliott was teasing him about it.</p><p>Lucas slid his hand down the length of Eliott\u2019s arm before joining their fingers together and resting his head against Eliott\u2019s arm. Eliott looked down at him curiously and Lucas rolled his eyes with a smile. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Eliott said, leaning down to kiss the top of his head.</p><p>When Sofiane and Imane got off the ferris wheel, Sofiane looked more lovestruck than usual and Imane sported a satisfied grin. \u201cWhere to next?\u201d she asked, and Lucas lit up with an idea. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s play carnival games,\u201d he suggested, pulling Eliott along by the hand. Once they\u2019re deep into the center of the fair, Lucas\u2019 gaze rested on his ticket to victory. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>It was giant, it was a plush hedgehog, and it was absolutely certain that Eliott would do everything in his power to win it for Lucas. Once Eliott won it for him, Sofiane would have to try to do something to top it, and there was no way in hell Imane was walking out of that carnival with a giant stuffed animal, competition or not. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cEliott, look,\u201d he said casually, pointing out the stuffed hedgehog. He watched Imane follow his gaze and watched as realization dawned on her face. Victory had never tasted better. Eliott\u2019s eyes lit up when he saw the prize, not even waiting for Lucas before going up to the booth and handing over tickets in exchange for a turn at the task, knocking over a few bottles all stacked on top of one another. </p><p>\u201cHow many do I have to knock over to win that hedgehog?\u201d Eliott asked, nodding at the animal. The man running the booth shrugged lazily. </p><p>\u201cAll of them?\u201d he sighed, clearly wishing he were anywhere else. Eliott nodded solemnly, brows furrowing in concentration. Lucas couldn\u2019t help but laugh at his boyfriend\u2019s serious nature so out of place from his natural demeanor. </p><p>Eliott wound up his arm, squinting his eyes to aim before throwing the ball, hitting at exactly the right spot, cheering as all the bottles fell. He picked up Lucas and spun him around once, much to the surprise of the disinterested man behind the booth. </p><p>\u201cDid you\u2026 want your prize?\u201d the man asked slowly, causing Eliott to drop Lucas and nod excitedly. \u201cYes, please,\u201d he said, pointing up at the hedgehog as if the man had forgotten. </p><p>Once he\u2019d retrieved it and handed it to Eliott, Eliott thanked him graciously and turned to Lucas, holding the stuffed animal behind his back. \u201cI have a surprise for you,\u201d Eliott said seriously. </p><p>\u201cAh, yeah?\u201d Lucas asked with a small giggle. Eliott nodded, waiting a moment to suspend the imagined tension before thrusting the hedgehog forward into Lucas\u2019 arms. </p><p>\u201cTa-da!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it!\u201d Lucas exclaimed, grabbing onto it and holding it close. He really did love it, competition or not. \u201cI\u2019ll cherish it forever.\u201d</p><p>Eliott\u2019s eyes crinkled and he leaned down to press a small kiss to Lucas\u2019 waiting lips, pulling away far too quickly in Lucas\u2019 opinion. Sofiane\u2019s voice broke him out of the love bubble he\u2019d succumbed to. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, how am I supposed to compete with that?\u201d he asked in exasperation. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Eliott asked, laughing slightly. </p><p>Sofiane leveled him with a stare that said <i>you know exactly what I\u2019m talking about</i>. \u201cFine, you win,\u201d he conceded, \u201cEliott is the best boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>Eliott continued to pretend he had no idea what Sofiane was talking about, but Lucas saw the victorious spark in his eyes. \u201cYou really are,\u201d Lucas said, hugging the hedgehog to his chest, trying his best to meet Eliott\u2019s eyes over the top of it. Eliott winked at him, a silly gesture that somehow still had his head spinning. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not so bad yourself,\u201d Imane shrugged, fingers holding onto one of Sofiane\u2019s hands loosely. Lucas raised his eyebrows at her, but she didn\u2019t notice, too busy smiling at Sofiane. Normally Lucas felt that there was a constant battle of vibrancy between Sofiane and Eliott\u2019s smiles, but the soft smile Imane was giving Sofiane right now easily surpassed the two of them. She was already one of the most beautiful people Lucas knew when she wasn\u2019t smiling like that, but her smile in that moment was something special to witness, even though he felt somewhat intrusive for looking.</p><p>\u201cAt least we know one thing for certain,\u201d Eliott said, draping an arm around Lucas\u2019 shoulders. Imane and Sofiane looked over at him quizzically. \u201cImane is the best girlfriend here,\u201d he continued, nudging Lucas\u2019 head with his own lightly. </p><p>Lucas looked up to meet Eliott\u2019s eyes. \u201cDork,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cThe <i>best</i> dork,\u201d Eliott corrected, and Lucas couldn\u2019t help but agree. He was so lucky to have this dork in his life.<br></p>",

The man running the booth shrugged lazily. </p><p>&ldquo;All of them?&rdquo; he sighed, clearly wishing he were anywhere else. Eliott nodded solemnly, brows furrowing in concentration. Lucas couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh at his boyfriend&rsquo;s serious nature so out of place from his natural demeanor. </p><p>Eliott wound up his arm, squinting his eyes to aim before throwing the ball, hitting at exactly the right spot, cheering as all the bottles fell. He picked up Lucas and spun him around once, much to the surprise of the disinterested man behind the booth. </p><p>&ldquo;Did you&hellip; want your prize?&rdquo; the man asked slowly, causing Eliott to drop Lucas and nod excitedly. &ldquo;Yes, please,&rdquo; he said, pointing up at the hedgehog as if the man had forgotten. </p><p>Once he&rsquo;d retrieved it and handed it to Eliott, Eliott thanked him graciously and turned to Lucas, holding the stuffed animal behind his back. &ldquo;I have a surprise for you,&rdquo; Eliott said seriously. </p><p>&ldquo;Ah, yeah?&rdquo; Lucas asked with a small giggle. Eliott nodded, waiting a moment to suspend the imagined tension before thrusting the hedgehog forward into Lucas&rsquo; arms. </p><p>&ldquo;Ta-da!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love it!&rdquo; Lucas exclaimed, grabbing onto it and holding it close. He really did love it, competition or not. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll cherish it forever.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott&rsquo;s eyes crinkled and he leaned down to press a small kiss to Lucas&rsquo; waiting lips, pulling away far too quickly in Lucas&rsquo; opinion. Sofiane&rsquo;s voice broke him out of the love bubble he&rsquo;d succumbed to. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, come on, how am I supposed to compete with that?&rdquo; he asked in exasperation. </p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Eliott asked, laughing slightly. </p><p>Sofiane leveled him with a stare that said <i>you know exactly what I&rsquo;m talking about</i>. &ldquo;Fine, you win,&rdquo; he conceded, &ldquo;Eliott is the best boyfriend.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott continued to pretend he had no idea what Sofiane was talking about, but Lucas saw the victorious spark in his eyes. &ldquo;You really are,&rdquo; Lucas said, hugging the hedgehog to his chest, trying his best to meet Eliott&rsquo;s eyes over the top of it. Eliott winked at him, a silly gesture that somehow still had his head spinning. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not so bad yourself,&rdquo; Imane shrugged, fingers holding onto one of Sofiane&rsquo;s hands loosely. Lucas raised his eyebrows at her, but she didn&rsquo;t notice, too busy smiling at Sofiane. Normally Lucas felt that there was a constant battle of vibrancy between Sofiane and Eliott&rsquo;s smiles, but the soft smile Imane was giving Sofiane right now easily surpassed the two of them. She was already one of the most beautiful people Lucas knew when she wasn&rsquo;t smiling like that, but her smile in that moment was something special to witness, even though he felt somewhat intrusive for looking.</p><p>&ldquo;At least we know one thing for certain,&rdquo; Eliott said, draping an arm around Lucas&rsquo; shoulders. Imane and Sofiane looked over at him quizzically. &ldquo;Imane is the best girlfriend here,&rdquo; he continued, nudging Lucas&rsquo; head with his own lightly. </p><p>Lucas looked up to meet Eliott&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Dork,&rdquo; he whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;The <i>best</i> dork,&rdquo; Eliott corrected, and Lucas couldn&rsquo;t help but agree. He was so lucky to have this dork in his life.<br /></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p><b>Double Date</b></p>\n<p>It was really Imane&rsquo;s fault, if Lucas was being honest. <i>She</i> was the one that had invited him and Eliott on a double date with her and Sofiane. She probably should have realized that it would turn into Eliott and Sofiane subtly trying to one-up the other for the title of &lsquo;best boyfriend&rsquo;. Usually Lucas was the competitive one, but it was fun to watch Eliott try so hard to prove something he really didn&rsquo;t need to prove. Lucas was fully aware that Eliott was the best boyfriend in the world, and he was sure Imane felt the same about Sofiane. It was all a matter of perspective. </p>\n<p>\tNevertheless, Imane and Lucas had decided to play a little game, trying to see how far each of their boyfriends would go to prove they were the best without admitting that was what they were doing. Lucas was sure Sofiane would crack first, and even though she wouldn&rsquo;t admit it, he was pretty sure Imane was inclined to agree. </p>\n</p>",
