With that strange sense of humor they now shared, Villanelle laughed harder.</i></p><p><i>Villanelle did her best to right herself but didn&rsquo;t get very far. When she gave up, she relaxed into the sheets with a luxurious sigh, as though there was no place she would rather be. &ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d come back to me. I knew you were mine.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Eve stepped to the edge of the bed, knife held loose in her hand but kept out of sight. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>The fatigue, the drugs, the hilarity of the situation she found herself in made Villanelle verbose. &ldquo;Then why are you here? Why did you track me down? I&rsquo;m nothing anymore, Eve, no one. If you cared about tracking down assassins and righting wrongs you would be anywhere else. But you are nothing too. Nothing without me.&rdquo;</i></p></p>",

Before coming to teach at the university, Dr. Polastri had worked in law enforcement doing criminal profiling, specifically focused on piecing together the work of serial killers as well as identifying the overarching character traits common amongst them. It was common knowledge that years before coming to the university, she had played a crucial role in the apprehension of a prolific female serial killer who had been haunting the streets of London for many years. She never talked about it, but when students searched her name, videos of old interviews came up and news articles written about how the successful investigation had launched her fledgling career straight into the higher ranks of MI6.</i></p><p><i>Dr. Astankova had worked for a major law firm that did big cases for huge companies and extremely wealthy individuals. She\u2019d handled scientific jury selection, going out and surveying communities and putting together detailed statistics on how to pick the best jurors based on social and character traits in order to manipulate them into getting the desired verdict, regardless of the evidence.

She had never revealed what specific cases she had worked on, but it was suspected that she had been responsible for getting some potentially very bad people off the hook for major crimes.</i></p><p><i>They both had stories that were creepy and forced people to seriously question the darker side of human nature.

They spent a lot of time bickering like children on a playground, but they were smart and their comebacks weren\u2019t just sassy, they were intelligent and people learned things from them.

Before coming to teach at the university, Dr. Polastri had worked in law enforcement doing criminal profiling, specifically focused on piecing together the work of serial killers as well as identifying the overarching character traits common amongst them. It was common knowledge that years before coming to the university, she had played a crucial role in the apprehension of a prolific female serial killer who had been haunting the streets of London for many years. She never talked about it, but when students searched her name, videos of old interviews came up and news articles written about how the successful investigation had launched her fledgling career straight into the higher ranks of MI6.</i></p><p><i>Dr. Astankova had worked for a major law firm that did big cases for huge companies and extremely wealthy individuals. She&rsquo;d handled scientific jury selection, going out and surveying communities and putting together detailed statistics on how to pick the best jurors based on social and character traits in order to manipulate them into getting the desired verdict, regardless of the evidence. Her success rates had been remarkably high, far better than the standard for the field. She had never revealed what specific cases she had worked on, but it was suspected that she had been responsible for getting some potentially very bad people off the hook for major crimes.</i></p><p><i>They both had stories that were creepy and forced people to seriously question the darker side of human nature. It was two different perspectives, but ultimately they were two sides of the same coin and as time went on they began to meld together quite well and the class became a new and exciting experience every day.</i></p><p><i>When they had taught separately, those stories were what drew people to sign up for their classes; they were what kept people coming to class every day. And that was still true once they were sharing the class, but there started to be new reasons as well.</i></p><p><i>They were fun together.

At least I think it does, maybe i&rsquo;m just thinking about it too much BUT I FEEL LIKE THE REPEATING MENTION OF SHEPARD&rsquo;S PIE is a metaphor for the fact that the people in eve&rsquo;s life don&rsquo;t know her and don&rsquo;t really try to understand her as she&rsquo;s meant to be understood. </p><p>Allow me to explain. </p><p>Shepard&rsquo;s pie is made a lot by Niko. Maybe because he thinks eve really likes it. Maybe that&rsquo;s all he knows how to cook. Who knows. The point is. We see it a lot. But we never see Eve actually really eat it. We&rsquo;re never shown him making it for eve and her being genuinely grateful for it.</p><p>First time it appears. She has it as leftovers for lunch. She swaps it with bill for his wife&rsquo;s sushi. She&rsquo;d rather have that. (In my mind this signifies that bill was the closest to seeing eve as she truly was, as shown by this gesture. RIP BILL)</p><p>Next. Villanelle breaks into eve&rsquo;s house the first time and asks for dinner. Eve heats up shepard&rsquo;s pie. V eats it. Eve only takes a tentative bite when v demands she do so. </p><p>Nothing in that dialogue or motion suggests eve likes the food in front of her. And yet. Villanelle assumes it&rsquo;s her favorite. Enough to ask Niko how to make it in s2. </p><p>This doesn&rsquo;t really catalyze to me as important until the finale. V asks eve what she wants her to make for her for dinner. We have to assume she wanted eve to say shepard&rsquo;s pie. After all, she had gone through the effort of learning the recipe. But eve says spaghetti.
