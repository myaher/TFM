Mentions of depression (and an overdose of hurt/comfort fluff)</i></p><hr><p>\u201cOh, I just can\u2019t believe they\u2019re\ngetting married.\u201d Harry sighed for the millionth time, with the biggest grin in\nthe world on his face. He\u2019d been like that for weeks after Ron and Hermione had\ngotten engaged, and now he was like it again because their wedding was in a few\ndays and he had to work on his best man\u2019s speech. </p><p>Draco tried\nto enjoy it, but he found it difficult. He was close friends with the bride and\ngroom to be, but he struggled to be really happy and excited for them. In fact\nhe struggled to be really happy and excited for anything. If Harry were to\npropose to him on the spot, he probably wouldn\u2019t be able to be happy about it\nfor more than a few hours. His head was just like that, ever since the war. </p><p>\u201cYou\njealous, grumpy old bear of mine?\u201d Harry chuckled and tackled him until he was\npinned down on their bed, which took very little effort. The lack of energy was\nanother thing that hadn\u2019t left him after the war, and when he had bad days\nthings just got a million times worse. </p><p>\u201cJealous of\nyou, a little bit. But it doesn\u2019t matter, this isn\u2019t about me. Your best\nfriends are getting married!\u201d He tried to sound enthusiastic but in all honesty\nhe had never sounded more fake in his life. Harry frowned and rolled off him,\nshooting him an inquisitive and worried look.</p><p>\u201cWhat is\nit, Draco? You haven\u2019t been truly happy for them ever since the announcement,\ndon\u2019t think I didn\u2019t notice. Why can\u2019t you be happy for them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not\nthat I can\u2019t be happy for <i>them</i>.\u201d Draco sighed, not wanting to say what he was about\nto say but knowing that he didn\u2019t really have an option. Harry wouldn\u2019t back\noff until he had a proper reason. The man had to be sure Darco didn\u2019t secretly\nhate his friends or something. \u201cI just\u2026 Can\u2019t be happy. Not longer than an hour\nor something. My brain just isn\u2019t wired like that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDraco\nyou\u2026\u201d Harry reached out for him and pulled him into a firm embrace. Draco hated\nit. The hug was only a confirmation that Harry deserved better than him. The\nman was so bright and happy and intense, while Draco was just flat. Static.\nEmpty. \u201cYou <i>should</i> be wired like that. It\u2019s not normal to not be\nhappy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d\nHe closed his eyes to stop himself from seeing all the happy excitement drain\nfrom his lover\u2019s face. This always happened. He always took people down with\nhim. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t make it any less true. Some things just\u2026 Damage people.\nAnd I haven\u2019t managed to fix myself. I\u2019m not strong enough for that.\u201d</p><p>Harry\nlooked like he was going to argue, but Draco didn\u2019t let him. \u201cNow when I\u2019m\nhappy it\u2019s always shallow and brief. Like putting paint on rotten woodwork.\nIt\u2019s going to look alright for awhile, but after just a few hours you can\nalready see the first water stains leak through. That\u2019s how my therapist put\nit, anyway. And she\u2019s right, I think. All positive emotions just feel shallow,\nwhile the empty darkness just gets\u2026 Everywhere, on bad days.\u201d</p><p>He took a\ndeep breath, and admitted something he rarely did. \u201cToday is a bad day.\u201d</p><p>Harry\ndidn\u2019t respond to that for a very long time, until he rolled onto him and hugged\nhim so hard Draco could hear his ribs creak. \u201cSometimes I just really wished\nthere was more I could do for you. That there was more I could do to help.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBecause\ndating a depressed person is exhausting.\u201d Draco muttered, his thoughts\naccidentally voices by his lips. Harry almost gasped when he heard that.</p><p>\u201cNo Draco.\nBecause it\u2019s awful to see you hurt like this. Because I want you to be happy\nfor <i>you</i>.\u201d Harry cupped his cheeks, finally releasing his\ndeadlock hug, and kissed him on the lips hard. \u201cI hate seeing you like this not\nbecause you\u2019re bothering me or getting me down, but because <i>you</i>\nfeel shit and I don\u2019t want you to.\u201d</p><p>Draco let\nout a deep breath, closing his eyes. Harry had so many reasons to be annoyed\nwith him, to ditch the entire relationship as a whole because Draco was such a\nmess, but all the man did was become more considerate. Become more gentle, make\nhim more tea, try harder to stop him from dissociating. He was just so sweet,\nand Draco didn\u2019t deserve him at all. </p><p>\u201cI love\nyou, Draco.\u201d Harry began covering his face and neck with kisses, sucking on the\nskin here and there in an attempt to pull him out of his bad place. \u201cYou make\nme so fucking happy, I sometimes feel like I can\u2019t handle the sheer amount of\njoy inside of me. I want that for you too. I want to make you just as happy as\nyou make me. Please let me do that.\u201d </p><p>A chuckle\nescaped Draco\u2019s lips despite everything. \u201cYou\u2019re impossible, Potter. Always\ntrying to save everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\ndon\u2019t want to save you. I want to help you. I want to assist, because I know\nthis is something that you have to beat yourself, but that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t\nmake you tea while you do that.\u201d Harry abandoned his neck in favour of his lips\nand spend several minutes making very sure Draco knew who Harry wanted to make\ntea for. \u201cI just want you to be happy. You deserve that and so much more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am\nhappy, sort of. As close to happy as I can be right now.\u201d A weak smile tugged\non his lips as he saw the passion in Harry\u2019s eyes. The determination of his\nlover made it almost impossible to keep believing that things wouldn\u2019t get\nbetter. \u201cYour mood can be quite infectious.\u201d</p><p>Harry\nsmiled along with him. \u201cFresh layer of paint.\u201d </p><p>He nodded.\n\u201cFresh layer of paint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\nthink you\u2019re overestimating how much rot there is. You\u2019ve already improved so\nmuch since the first time we met.\u201d Draco rolled his eyes. Harry always called\nthe first time they met after the war \u2018the first time they met\u2019. He\u2019d stopped\ncorrecting the man by now, he knew it served no point anyway. \u201cI know you\u2019re\ngoing to get there soon enough, babe. You\u2019re so much stronger than you give\nyourself credit for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really\ndon\u2019t think that\u2019s true.\u201d He huffed, shaking his head at Harry\u2019s never ending\nGryffindor positivity. \u201cBut thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nwelcome.\u201d Harry kissed his forehead and pulled him into a more gentle hug.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll always be welcome. For the rest of your life.\u201d</p>",

Harry wouldn\u2019t back\noff until he had a proper reason. The man had to be sure Darco didn\u2019t secretly\nhate his friends or something. \u201cI just\u2026 Can\u2019t be happy. Not longer than an hour\nor something. My brain just isn\u2019t wired like that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDraco\nyou\u2026\u201d Harry reached out for him and pulled him into a firm embrace. Draco hated\nit. The hug was only a confirmation that Harry deserved better than him. The\nman was so bright and happy and intense, while Draco was just flat. Static.\nEmpty. \u201cYou <i>should</i> be wired like that. It\u2019s not normal to not be\nhappy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d\nHe closed his eyes to stop himself from seeing all the happy excitement drain\nfrom his lover\u2019s face. This always happened. He always took people down with\nhim. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t make it any less true. Some things just\u2026 Damage people.\nAnd I haven\u2019t managed to fix myself. I\u2019m not strong enough for that.\u201d</p><p>Harry\nlooked like he was going to argue, but Draco didn\u2019t let him. \u201cNow when I\u2019m\nhappy it\u2019s always shallow and brief. Like putting paint on rotten woodwork.\nIt\u2019s going to look alright for awhile, but after just a few hours you can\nalready see the first water stains leak through. That\u2019s how my therapist put\nit, anyway. And she\u2019s right, I think. All positive emotions just feel shallow,\nwhile the empty darkness just gets\u2026 Everywhere, on bad days.\u201d</p><p>He took a\ndeep breath, and admitted something he rarely did. \u201cToday is a bad day.\u201d</p><p>Harry\ndidn\u2019t respond to that for a very long time, until he rolled onto him and hugged\nhim so hard Draco could hear his ribs creak. \u201cSometimes I just really wished\nthere was more I could do for you. That there was more I could do to help.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBecause\ndating a depressed person is exhausting.\u201d Draco muttered, his thoughts\naccidentally voices by his lips. Harry almost gasped when he heard that.</p><p>\u201cNo Draco.\nBecause it\u2019s awful to see you hurt like this. Because I want you to be happy\nfor <i>you</i>.\u201d Harry cupped his cheeks, finally releasing his\ndeadlock hug, and kissed him on the lips hard. \u201cI hate seeing you like this not\nbecause you\u2019re bothering me or getting me down, but because <i>you</i>\nfeel shit and I don\u2019t want you to.\u201d</p><p>Draco let\nout a deep breath, closing his eyes. Harry had so many reasons to be annoyed\nwith him, to ditch the entire relationship as a whole because Draco was such a\nmess, but all the man did was become more considerate. Become more gentle, make\nhim more tea, try harder to stop him from dissociating. He was just so sweet,\nand Draco didn\u2019t deserve him at all. </p><p>\u201cI love\nyou, Draco.\u201d Harry began covering his face and neck with kisses, sucking on the\nskin here and there in an attempt to pull him out of his bad place. \u201cYou make\nme so fucking happy, I sometimes feel like I can\u2019t handle the sheer amount of\njoy inside of me. I want that for you too. I want to make you just as happy as\nyou make me. Please let me do that.\u201d </p><p>A chuckle\nescaped Draco\u2019s lips despite everything. \u201cYou\u2019re impossible, Potter. Always\ntrying to save everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\ndon\u2019t want to save you. I want to help you. I want to assist, because I know\nthis is something that you have to beat yourself, but that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t\nmake you tea while you do that.\u201d Harry abandoned his neck in favour of his lips\nand spend several minutes making very sure Draco knew who Harry wanted to make\ntea for. \u201cI just want you to be happy. You deserve that and so much more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am\nhappy, sort of. As close to happy as I can be right now.\u201d A weak smile tugged\non his lips as he saw the passion in Harry\u2019s eyes. The determination of his\nlover made it almost impossible to keep believing that things wouldn\u2019t get\nbetter. \u201cYour mood can be quite infectious.\u201d</p><p>Harry\nsmiled along with him. \u201cFresh layer of paint.\u201d </p><p>He nodded.\n\u201cFresh layer of paint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\nthink you\u2019re overestimating how much rot there is. You\u2019ve already improved so\nmuch since the first time we met.\u201d Draco rolled his eyes. Harry always called\nthe first time they met after the war \u2018the first time they met\u2019. He\u2019d stopped\ncorrecting the man by now, he knew it served no point anyway. \u201cI know you\u2019re\ngoing to get there soon enough, babe. You\u2019re so much stronger than you give\nyourself credit for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really\ndon\u2019t think that\u2019s true.\u201d He huffed, shaking his head at Harry\u2019s never ending\nGryffindor positivity. \u201cBut thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nwelcome.\u201d Harry kissed his forehead and pulled him into a more gentle hug.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll always be welcome.
