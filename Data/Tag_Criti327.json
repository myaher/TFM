He just couldn\u2019t help it, especially not when the random scraps of lyrics he had floating around in his brain were stubbornly refusing to properly arrange themselves into a song. He sighed in frustration at the journal page, still blank after half an hour, and rearranged himself on the sofa he was currently splayed across, throwing one leg over the back of it and flicking his tail idly from side to side, as if that would rattle something loose. </p><p>\u201cYou can do that in your room you know,\u201d Yasha commented flatly from the kitchen table, not looking up from her breakfast or her newspaper.</p><p>\u201cI like the light better in here!\u201d Molly insisted, arching back off the arm of the sofa so he could eye her from upside down, \u201cAnd besides, what\u2019s the point of sighing if no one hears me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat indeed\u2026\u201d his roommate muttered, rolling her eyes. Not that she\u2019d expected anything else from him, \u201cI just wouldn\u2019t spend too much time on that couch, is all. It\u2019s probably got fleas or something, I found it on the end of the block. Didn\u2019t get a chance to clean it yet.\u201d </p><p>Molly wrinkled his nose, jumping up so quickly he nearly ran into the coffee table, \u201cYasha! You promised me no more street furniture!\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Yasha jerked her spoon at him, \u201cI carried that single handed all the way up to this apartment so some appreciation would be nice.\u201d </p><p>Molly stuck his tongue out at her as he folded his lanky body into the chair across from her, slapping his notebook down between them, as if that was going to jostle the odd words and phrases into a proper song. </p><p>Yasha pulled a face, \u201cLook, I\u2019ll stop getting couches off the street if you start wearing some damn clothes around here.\u201d </p><!-- more --><p>Molly huffed and twitched the silk robe he was wearing (sort of wearing) until it covered a little more of his chest and thighs, knotting it loosely. As far as he was concerned, a pair of underwear and a robe was perfectly acceptable attire for noon on a Sunday but he knew better than to push Yasha too far. She could pick him up all the way off the floor if she wanted to. </p><p>He ran his fingers through his bedraggled hair, lying tangled around his horns in the way it always did without nearly an hour of dedicated grooming in front of the bathroom mirror. \u201cI\u2019m having a brain block,\u201d he announced grandly, trying to get his roommate\u2019s attention back on him. </p><p>\u201cAre you now?\u201d Yasha didn\u2019t sound particularly interested as she flicked a page over idly, wondering how her attempts to get him to go to his room had been interpreted as an invitation to disrupt her morning even further. </p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Molly frowned, splaying across the table to see if he could get in her eyeline, \u201cI\u2019m having feelings, Yash, big feelings. But they won\u2019t turn into songs. If I can\u2019t properly channel my emotions into my art, I\u2019m never going to be a successful musician.\u201d </p><p>Yasha flashed him a look, making no effort to hide her exasperation, \u201cYou know, I bet most successful musicians don\u2019t spend their time lounging all over their apartments in their underwear. Maybe actually doing something would help. Like sorting the laundry you said you\u2019d do three days ago or actually getting some fresh air and natural sunlight. You could come to the gym with me? Endorphins, man.\u201d </p><p>Molly clicked his tongue against his teeth, \u201cNot a great idea. Hooked up with the guy at the front desk and haven\u2019t called him back.\u201d </p><p>Yasha pinched the bridge of her nose, scowling, \u201cI told you\u2026I fucking told you that was a bad idea, \u00a0if I have to avoid another place because of you, I can\u2019t keep up\u2026\u201d</p><p>The tiefling drowned out her grumbling with another world-weary sigh, not in the mood to hear her opinions on his love life yet again, \u201cI just feel so\u2026out of sorts\u2026\u201d he slapped his hand on the table decisively, as if struck by an ingenious realisation, nearly upending the vase of flowers, \u201cI should smoke some more weed! That always gets the lyrics flowing!\u201d </p><p>Defeated, the newspaper was flipped closed and a pair of heavy lidded, mismatched eyes fixed sternly on Molly. In signing up to be his roommate, after a few months of working together at the community theatre, she hadn\u2019t realised she\u2019d also become his guitarist, his life coach, his impulse control and his guardian angel as well. It wasn\u2019t exactly what she\u2019d wanted but Molly cooked like a dream and didn\u2019t keep her up all night so she\u2019d learned to stomach it. </p><p>\u201cKay,\u201d she told him sternly, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna swap out the drugs for a more socially acceptable one and get you out of the apartment. Go fetch some coffee.\u201d </p><p>The tiefling\u2019s face fall, \u201cAw, come on, it\u2019s not my turn! ! And besides, I hate ordering for you, the barista looks at me like I\u2019m crazy when I ask for six espresso shots in one cup\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit, I went the day before yesterday.\u201d </p><p>The two stared at each other, Molly\u2019s restless red eyes fixed on Yasha\u2019s heavily eyeliner ringed ones.

As far as he was concerned, a pair of underwear and a robe was perfectly acceptable attire for noon on a Sunday but he knew better than to push Yasha too far. She could pick him up all the way off the floor if she wanted to. </p><p>He ran his fingers through his bedraggled hair, lying tangled around his horns in the way it always did without nearly an hour of dedicated grooming in front of the bathroom mirror. \u201cI\u2019m having a brain block,\u201d he announced grandly, trying to get his roommate\u2019s attention back on him. </p><p>\u201cAre you now?\u201d Yasha didn\u2019t sound particularly interested as she flicked a page over idly, wondering how her attempts to get him to go to his room had been interpreted as an invitation to disrupt her morning even further. </p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Molly frowned, splaying across the table to see if he could get in her eyeline, \u201cI\u2019m having feelings, Yash, big feelings. But they won\u2019t turn into songs. If I can\u2019t properly channel my emotions into my art, I\u2019m never going to be a successful musician.\u201d </p><p>Yasha flashed him a look, making no effort to hide her exasperation, \u201cYou know, I bet most successful musicians don\u2019t spend their time lounging all over their apartments in their underwear. Maybe actually doing something would help. Like sorting the laundry you said you\u2019d do three days ago or actually getting some fresh air and natural sunlight. You could come to the gym with me? Endorphins, man.\u201d </p><p>Molly clicked his tongue against his teeth, \u201cNot a great idea. Hooked up with the guy at the front desk and haven\u2019t called him back.\u201d </p><p>Yasha pinched the bridge of her nose, scowling, \u201cI told you\u2026I fucking told you that was a bad idea, \u00a0if I have to avoid another place because of you, I can\u2019t keep up\u2026\u201d</p><p>The tiefling drowned out her grumbling with another world-weary sigh, not in the mood to hear her opinions on his love life yet again, \u201cI just feel so\u2026out of sorts\u2026\u201d he slapped his hand on the table decisively, as if struck by an ingenious realisation, nearly upending the vase of flowers, \u201cI should smoke some more weed! That always gets the lyrics flowing!\u201d </p><p>Defeated, the newspaper was flipped closed and a pair of heavy lidded, mismatched eyes fixed sternly on Molly. In signing up to be his roommate, after a few months of working together at the community theatre, she hadn\u2019t realised she\u2019d also become his guitarist, his life coach, his impulse control and his guardian angel as well. It wasn\u2019t exactly what she\u2019d wanted but Molly cooked like a dream and didn\u2019t keep her up all night so she\u2019d learned to stomach it. </p><p>\u201cKay,\u201d she told him sternly, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna swap out the drugs for a more socially acceptable one and get you out of the apartment. Go fetch some coffee.\u201d </p><p>The tiefling\u2019s face fall, \u201cAw, come on, it\u2019s not my turn! ! And besides, I hate ordering for you, the barista looks at me like I\u2019m crazy when I ask for six espresso shots in one cup\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit, I went the day before yesterday.\u201d </p><p>The two stared at each other, Molly\u2019s restless red eyes fixed on Yasha\u2019s heavily eyeliner ringed ones. After a few moments, they both shrugged holding out their fists and tapping them three times against the table. Yasha threw scissors, Molly threw paper. </p><p>He wailed at his defeat, \u201cYou always go scissors!\u201d </p><p>She arched her eyebrow at him, \u201cThen why don\u2019t you always go rock, smart guy?\u201d </p><p>He had no answer to that but to reach over and knock her paper off the table, like a particularly ornery cat, before getting up and flouncing off in a whirl of embroidered black silk and a flash of a middle finger, slamming the door to his bedroom for good measure. </p><p>Yasha huffed out a low rumbling chuckle as the noise of the moodiest shower ever taken echoed through their tiny, cramped apartment. She wondered briefly if her idiot of a best friend was actually going to realise what was bothering him so much, what was written so clearly on his face and in the way he\u2019d been fidgeting all over the place for hours now. </p><p>If he didn\u2019t catch on soon, she was going to have to tell him. No way in hell she was dealing with a moony eyed, love struck Mollymauk for much longer.</p><p>Knowing how much he hated the cold and seeing the fractal dusting of frost clinging to the outside of his tiny window, Molly dressed accordingly in billowy harem pants and a tight turtleneck sweater which was a bitch to get over his horns but he looked so good in it, it was decidedly worth it.

But they won\u2019t turn into songs. If I can\u2019t properly channel my emotions into my art, I\u2019m never going to be a successful musician.\u201d </p><p>Yasha flashed him a look, making no effort to hide her exasperation, \u201cYou know, I bet most successful musicians don\u2019t spend their time lounging all over their apartments in their underwear. Maybe actually doing something would help. Like sorting the laundry you said you\u2019d do three days ago or actually getting some fresh air and natural sunlight. You could come to the gym with me? Endorphins, man.\u201d </p><p>Molly clicked his tongue against his teeth, \u201cNot a great idea. Hooked up with the guy at the front desk and haven\u2019t called him back.\u201d </p><p>Yasha pinched the bridge of her nose, scowling, \u201cI told you\u2026I fucking told you that was a bad idea, \u00a0if I have to avoid another place because of you, I can\u2019t keep up\u2026\u201d</p><p>The tiefling drowned out her grumbling with another world-weary sigh, not in the mood to hear her opinions on his love life yet again, \u201cI just feel so\u2026out of sorts\u2026\u201d he slapped his hand on the table decisively, as if struck by an ingenious realisation, nearly upending the vase of flowers, \u201cI should smoke some more weed! That always gets the lyrics flowing!\u201d </p><p>Defeated, the newspaper was flipped closed and a pair of heavy lidded, mismatched eyes fixed sternly on Molly. In signing up to be his roommate, after a few months of working together at the community theatre, she hadn\u2019t realised she\u2019d also become his guitarist, his life coach, his impulse control and his guardian angel as well. It wasn\u2019t exactly what she\u2019d wanted but Molly cooked like a dream and didn\u2019t keep her up all night so she\u2019d learned to stomach it. </p><p>\u201cKay,\u201d she told him sternly, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna swap out the drugs for a more socially acceptable one and get you out of the apartment. Go fetch some coffee.\u201d </p><p>The tiefling\u2019s face fall, \u201cAw, come on, it\u2019s not my turn! ! And besides, I hate ordering for you, the barista looks at me like I\u2019m crazy when I ask for six espresso shots in one cup\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit, I went the day before yesterday.\u201d </p><p>The two stared at each other, Molly\u2019s restless red eyes fixed on Yasha\u2019s heavily eyeliner ringed ones. After a few moments, they both shrugged holding out their fists and tapping them three times against the table. Yasha threw scissors, Molly threw paper. </p><p>He wailed at his defeat, \u201cYou always go scissors!\u201d </p><p>She arched her eyebrow at him, \u201cThen why don\u2019t you always go rock, smart guy?\u201d </p><p>He had no answer to that but to reach over and knock her paper off the table, like a particularly ornery cat, before getting up and flouncing off in a whirl of embroidered black silk and a flash of a middle finger, slamming the door to his bedroom for good measure. </p><p>Yasha huffed out a low rumbling chuckle as the noise of the moodiest shower ever taken echoed through their tiny, cramped apartment. She wondered briefly if her idiot of a best friend was actually going to realise what was bothering him so much, what was written so clearly on his face and in the way he\u2019d been fidgeting all over the place for hours now. </p><p>If he didn\u2019t catch on soon, she was going to have to tell him. No way in hell she was dealing with a moony eyed, love struck Mollymauk for much longer.</p><p>Knowing how much he hated the cold and seeing the fractal dusting of frost clinging to the outside of his tiny window, Molly dressed accordingly in billowy harem pants and a tight turtleneck sweater which was a bitch to get over his horns but he looked so good in it, it was decidedly worth it.

Molly had never actually had someone approach him after any of his shows, much less someone who\u2019d actually praised his songs rather than asking him to keep it down. Sure, the guy had been plastered and swayed where he was standing but Molly was taking all the positive feedback he could get right now. </p><p>And he\u2019d asked for his number.

He sighed in frustration at the journal page, still blank after half an hour, and rearranged himself on the sofa he was currently splayed across, throwing one leg over the back of it and flicking his tail idly from side to side, as if that would rattle something loose. </p><p>&ldquo;You can do that in your room you know,&rdquo; Yasha commented flatly from the kitchen table, not looking up from her breakfast or her newspaper.</p><p>&ldquo;I like the light better in here!&rdquo; Molly insisted, arching back off the arm of the sofa so he could eye her from upside down, &ldquo;And besides, what&rsquo;s the point of sighing if no one hears me?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What indeed&hellip;&rdquo; his roommate muttered, rolling her eyes.
