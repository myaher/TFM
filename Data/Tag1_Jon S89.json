She also gets out of the bed naked in front of Luwin after he arrives with the scroll. \u00a0When Ned comments that she is embarrassing the maester, she responds that he has birth all her children and so has seen everything she has to offer on multiple occasions.</p><p>After reading Lysa\u2019s note, Ned decides to accept Robert\u2019s request that he become the Hand of the King. \u00a0On the show, Cat is resistant to him going while in the books, she encourages him to do so. \u00a0In both instances, she is looking to protect her family. \u00a0And so Ned heads to Kings Landing with the king where he meets his death and his family\u2019s life is all but destroyed as a result. \u00a0As a callback, I think that we may get a similar scene this season involving a scroll but it won\u2019t be one that comes via a raven.</p><p>Many of us have speculated on the possibility of something of a romantic nature happening in the Lord\u2019s Chamber between Jon and Sansa. \u00a0For myself, I\u2019ve felt that it was a strong possibility since the writers made a point of letting the audience know that Jon had arranged for her to have the suite\u2026especially as it was done in the same scene that he gave her that longing forehead kiss. My theory is that once the truth about Jon\u2019s identity comes out, the emotional scene that David Nutter mentioned will occur between him and Sansa in the Lord\u2019s Chamber and it will lead to them making love.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe fans will not be let down,\u201d says director David Nutter. \u201cThere are a lot of firsts in these episodes. There\u2019s the funniest sequence I\u2019ve ever shot on this show, <b>the most emotional and compelling scene I\u2019ve ever shot</b>, and there\u2019s one scene where there\u2019s so many [major characters] together it feels like you\u2019re watching a superhero movie.\u201d-<b>David Nutter, Entertainment Weekly</b></p></blockquote><p>I think this for several reasons. \u00a0First, as I\u2019ve mentioned, with all the callbacks to the first episode, it makes sense that there is one of the scene between Ned and Cat in the Lord\u2019s Chamber as it was so important to the story. \u00a0Secondly, Sansa having a romantic encounter with a man who loves her for herself and not her inheritance has been part of her character arc in both on the show and in the books. \u00a0On the show, Petyr sold her to the Boltons and we all know what happened there. \u00a0Unfortunately, I don\u2019t rule out something similar happening in the Vale from either Petyr or Harry the Heir. \u00a0It maybe just an attempt but I definitely can see it happening. </p><p>Since she escaped from Ramsay\u2019s clutches on the show, Sansa has been understandably protecting herself both mentally and physically. \u00a0Part of this self-protection is reflected in how she dresses. \u00a0She is always covered from head to toe and she dresses in clothing that are difficult to take off. \u00a0Even her hands are not available for anyone to touch. \u00a0The only people who have been allowed to touch any part of her have been her family when she reunited with them. \u00a0These have included a few notable moments with Jon\u2014when she grabs his hand and most notably when he gave her the forehead kiss. \u00a0</p><p>A part of Sansa\u2019s arc has also been about learning to trust again and to allow a man in. \u00a0It is without a doubt not the only part of her arc and it is not even the most important. \u00a0Nevertheless, it is an aspect of her story and the likelihood of a romantic encounter between her and a man has been percolating throughout her arc. \u00a0The only question is with whom. \u00a0</p><p>Unlike what some think, it won\u2019t be with the Hound as in my opinion, his part in her story\u2026especially in the books will ultimately be shown to be about Jon or at least Jon as he will be upon his return. \u00a0The Hound\u2019s savage nature reflects what Jon will be like when he returns from the dead after his consciousness spends some time in Ghost. \u00a0I think it\u2019s why Martin gave him a moniker reminiscent of a wolfhound. \u00a0And as Sansa tempered the Hound, she will temper Jon. \u00a0Plus, Sandor Clegane is old enough to be Sansa\u2019s father and relationships between older men and girls young enough to be their daughters are one that George\u2019s writings shows to be abhorrent and must end. </p><p>It also won\u2019t be Tyrion for too many reasons to list\u2026least of all being that Sansa would never join with a Lannister after what they did to her family. \u00a0Plus, that is not the story either George or D&amp;D have been writing. \u00a0And it most certainly won\u2019t be Gendry or Pod\u2026two men she doesn\u2019t know. \u00a0In my book, this only leaves Jon. \u00a0A romantic relationship between the two has been hinted at in both the books and show. \u00a0And as there are only 6 episodes left, it has to happen this season. \u00a0</p><p>We also need to remember that this is <i>Game of Thrones</i> that we are talking about and the writers like to throw sex at the audience. \u00a0 With war and almost certain death looming for most of our heroes, it\u2019s almost guaranteed that there will be at least one this year as well and I suspect it will be the most important one of the entire series. \u00a0Making love and connecting to another human being before going off to war is a popular trope in both literature and the visual medium. \u00a0When one knows that one is facing death, it forces you to deal and acknowledge what is most important. \u00a0</p><p>Another reason I think that there will be a romantic encounter between the two eldest remaining Starks in the Lord\u2019s Chamber is because since they reunited, D&amp;D has written them with the angst George described in his original outline for Jon and Arya. \u00a0And so it seems possible to me that based on D&amp;D\u2019s writing George quite likely switched things up with the sisters. \u00a0There are many great metas out there that breakdown the many book clues point to a potential romantic relationship between Jon and Sansa and so there is no need to delve into those them here again as this article is about the show.</p><p>The scene I propose will occur between Jon and Sansa may also explain why things were downplayed in the one between him and Dany. \u00a0I think the emotional baring of the soul by Jon\u2019s in regards to the truth about his heritage, the fact that he was killed by his men and an examination of his scars both of the physical and mental variety will take place between him and Sansa. \u00a0The examination of both their scars will be between them and I am of the opinion that this is the emotional scene David Nutter referenced in the EW interview.</p><p>If as I proposed there is a romantic encounter between Jon and Sansa that harkens back to the one between Ned and Cat from episode one, then I think that just as Luwin knocked on the door of the Lord\u2019s Chamber after N&amp;C made love, Sam will do the same with the younger Starks. \u00a0Like with Luwin, Sam will come bearing a scroll with bad news. \u00a0And I think that it will turn out to be this scroll that Sophie was referring to in her interview. \u00a0</p><p>However, unlike the one from Lysa, it won\u2019t arrive via a raven. \u00a0Nonetheless, just as the one from Lysa resulted in Ned, the Lord of the House heading south, I think that the one Sam bears will mean the same thing for Sansa, the current Lady of Winterfell as Jon sends her away for protection. \u00a0I also think that in Kings Landing, we will get to see a reenactment of the tale told by the common folks in the books of how she escaped from the Red Keep.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The dwarf&rsquo;s wife did the murder with him,&rdquo; swore an archer in Lord Rowan&rsquo;s livery. &ldquo;Afterward, she vanished from the hall in a puff of brimstone,<b> and a ghostly direwolf was seen prowling the Red Keep, blood dripping from his jaws.&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>A Storm of Swords - Jaime VII</b></p></blockquote><p>If the scroll that Sam bears does not arrive via a raven then the question becomes, where did it come from. \u00a0Well, as I\u2019ve speculated in other posts, I\u2019m of the opinion that it was unknowingly brought to Winterfell by Sam himself. \u00a0In fact, I suspect that it is the very same scroll that Sam is shown stealing in the scene below of when he left the Citadel. \u00a0You can find the specific theft at the 2:07 mark.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2F1ueJGz6c5g0\"><iframe width=\"540\"

allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure><p>We are shown hundreds of scrolls on the shelves and yet Sam only takes one. And now we find out from Sophie and Maisie\u2019s interview that a scroll will play an important role in the final season. \u00a0I don\u2019t know about you but I\u2019m adding 1 and 1 and getting 2. \u00a0</p><p>To add more fire to my theory, consider the photo released of Jorah and Dany standing in what looks to be an office with a shelf filled with scrolls behind them. \u00a0Just happenstance? \u00a0I say not. \u00a0I suspect that this is the same office that Sam has been using since he came to Winterfell and knowing him, he most likely just stashed the scroll he took from the Citadel in with the ones already on the shelf with plans to look at it later.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1758\" data-orig-height=\"1168\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/622884f3b4373c768926bf7d0632359e/tumblr_inline_pp8w4olLDf1scj86c_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1758\" data-orig-height=\"1168\"/></figure><p>Now if I\u2019m right and the scroll in question is the one Sam stole, the size of it suggests that it is not the type that usually bears a message. \u00a0The fact that it was taken from the Citadel also indicates that it contains old and possibly even truly ancient knowledge. \u00a0If so, then it most likely has something to do with the mystery surrounding the Night King and the White Walkers.</p><p>Things get even more interesting when you consider the fact that Sophie\u2019s comment about the scroll being given to her as a memento of her time on the show strongly suggests that whatever is in it has to do with the character of Sansa Stark. \u00a0The obvious question then becomes, why would an ancient scroll about the Night King have something to do with Sansa? \u00a0Nothing would be the obvious answer! \u00a0Unless that is, the scroll in question has something to do with the Corpse Queen.</p><p>The story of the Night\u2019s King is also the story of the Corpse Queen. \u00a0The two go hand in hand. \u00a0In this instance, I am talking about the book version and not the Night King from the show. \u00a0However, as his tale in the books is knotted to that of his queen, I believe that there also must be one on the show.</p><p>Many in the fandom have proposed that because white has been introduced into Dany\u2019s costume in such a way as to promote the idea of her as the Night\u2019s Queen (the fandom name for the Corpse Queen), it must mean that she is the one that the NK is after. \u00a0I for one think that is just the writers working to throw people of the true trail. \u00a0The Corpse Queen is ice not fire. \u00a0</p><p>The only two remaining female characters on the show that fulfill the necessary criteria are Arya and Sansa. \u00a0I happen to think that the elder Stark daughter with her \u201ckissed by fire\u201d hair will turn out to be queen in more ways than one. \u00a0And as I proposed in this <a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/173321285156/beric-dondarrion-will-give-the-kiss-of-life-to\" target=\"_blank\"><b>essay</b></a> about her kidnapping by Cersei, Beric will give her the \u201ckiss of life.\u201d \u00a0Sansa will literally have been kissed by fire when Beric brings her back.\u00a0 Hence, when she ascends to the throne\u2026whether of all of Westeros or just of the North, she will for all intents and purposes be the Corpse Queen.</p><p>Now, I have to say that I strongly think that things will play out in a totally different manner in the books. \u00a0I\u2019m not saying that Sansa won\u2019t be the modern day version of the Corpse Queen. \u00a0I think that will also be the case in the books. \u00a0However, I think that the seeds George sprinkles in his garden to get there will be much different than Dan and Dave.</p><p>Before I end, I want to mention a couple of other callbacks I think will play out in the final season. \u00a0Based on the trailer, I would not be surprise to see a version of the scene between Ned and Cat in the Godswood from the first episode. \u00a0We don\u2019t see Sansa in the shot of Jon by the weirwood tree but I suspect that she is either sitting on the limb and Jon\u2019s body is hiding her or else, she will approaching him just as Cat did to Ned as he was cleaning Ice. \u00a0</p><p>I also think that the scene of Dany approaching Jon in the crypts is a call back to Ned and Robert visiting Lyanna\u2019s statue in season one. \u00a0While the obvious thought is that Jon is standing in front of the statue, I\u2019m not quite sure that is the case because as @<a href=\"https://thelawyerthatwaspromised.tumblr.com/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank\" target=\"_blank\">thelawyerthatwaspromised</a> pointed out in her breakdown essay of the scene, Dany\u2019s approach from the other side of the crypt does not match up with the location of Lyanna\u2019s statue (unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t find the essay in question to post a link). \u00a0It\u2019s possible that the positioning of the statue is a mistake on the part of the show but I doubt it. \u00a0</p><p>I don\u2019t know the reason but even if he is not standing in front of his mother\u2019s statue in the trailer, I suspect that he and Dany will still have a conversation in front of it.\u00a0 It is here that I suspect Jon and Dany will have the conversation about her burning Sam\u2019s father and brother.\u00a0 Her face as she approaches him is filled with trepidation.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1746\" data-orig-height=\"866\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c22a3e42a767855b8696e5932b20fe0e/tumblr_inline_pp8wt0I4HP1scj86c_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1746\" data-orig-height=\"866\"/></figure><p>What she did to Sam\u2019s family and the other men who didn\u2019t bend the knee is partially why just as Ned did not tell Robert the truth in that the moment, Jon also will not reveal his true identity to Dany.\u00a0 He will fear the danger the revelation could mean to him and his family as well as the effect her potential actions could have on the battle against the White Walkers. \u00a0Plus, he has no interest in the Iron Throne.</p><p>As I said at the beginning, this is purely a speculative essay but with the many callbacks expected, it\u2019s quite possible that some of these scenarios I proposed might indeed play out.</p>",

There\u2019s the funniest sequence I\u2019ve ever shot on this show, <b>the most emotional and compelling scene I\u2019ve ever shot</b>, and there\u2019s one scene where there\u2019s so many [major characters] together it feels like you\u2019re watching a superhero movie.\u201d-<b>David Nutter, Entertainment Weekly</b></p></blockquote><p>I think this for several reasons. \u00a0First, as I\u2019ve mentioned, with all the callbacks to the first episode, it makes sense that there is one of the scene between Ned and Cat in the Lord\u2019s Chamber as it was so important to the story. \u00a0Secondly, Sansa having a romantic encounter with a man who loves her for herself and not her inheritance has been part of her character arc in both on the show and in the books. \u00a0On the show, Petyr sold her to the Boltons and we all know what happened there. \u00a0Unfortunately, I don\u2019t rule out something similar happening in the Vale from either Petyr or Harry the Heir. \u00a0It maybe just an attempt but I definitely can see it happening. </p><p>Since she escaped from Ramsay\u2019s clutches on the show, Sansa has been understandably protecting herself both mentally and physically. \u00a0Part of this self-protection is reflected in how she dresses. \u00a0She is always covered from head to toe and she dresses in clothing that are difficult to take off. \u00a0Even her hands are not available for anyone to touch. \u00a0The only people who have been allowed to touch any part of her have been her family when she reunited with them. \u00a0These have included a few notable moments with Jon\u2014when she grabs his hand and most notably when he gave her the forehead kiss. \u00a0</p><p>A part of Sansa\u2019s arc has also been about learning to trust again and to allow a man in. \u00a0It is without a doubt not the only part of her arc and it is not even the most important. \u00a0Nevertheless, it is an aspect of her story and the likelihood of a romantic encounter between her and a man has been percolating throughout her arc. \u00a0The only question is with whom. \u00a0</p><p>Unlike what some think, it won\u2019t be with the Hound as in my opinion, his part in her story\u2026especially in the books will ultimately be shown to be about Jon or at least Jon as he will be upon his return. \u00a0The Hound\u2019s savage nature reflects what Jon will be like when he returns from the dead after his consciousness spends some time in Ghost. \u00a0I think it\u2019s why Martin gave him a moniker reminiscent of a wolfhound. \u00a0And as Sansa tempered the Hound, she will temper Jon. \u00a0Plus, Sandor Clegane is old enough to be Sansa\u2019s father and relationships between older men and girls young enough to be their daughters are one that George\u2019s writings shows to be abhorrent and must end. </p><p>It also won\u2019t be Tyrion for too many reasons to list\u2026least of all being that Sansa would never join with a Lannister after what they did to her family. \u00a0Plus, that is not the story either George or D&amp;D have been writing. \u00a0And it most certainly won\u2019t be Gendry or Pod\u2026two men she doesn\u2019t know. \u00a0In my book, this only leaves Jon. \u00a0A romantic relationship between the two has been hinted at in both the books and show. \u00a0And as there are only 6 episodes left, it has to happen this season. \u00a0</p><p>We also need to remember that this is <i>Game of Thrones</i> that we are talking about and the writers like to throw sex at the audience. \u00a0 With war and almost certain death looming for most of our heroes, it\u2019s almost guaranteed that there will be at least one this year as well and I suspect it will be the most important one of the entire series. \u00a0Making love and connecting to another human being before going off to war is a popular trope in both literature and the visual medium. \u00a0When one knows that one is facing death, it forces you to deal and acknowledge what is most important. \u00a0</p><p>Another reason I think that there will be a romantic encounter between the two eldest remaining Starks in the Lord\u2019s Chamber is because since they reunited, D&amp;D has written them with the angst George described in his original outline for Jon and Arya. \u00a0And so it seems possible to me that based on D&amp;D\u2019s writing George quite likely switched things up with the sisters. \u00a0There are many great metas out there that breakdown the many book clues point to a potential romantic relationship between Jon and Sansa and so there is no need to delve into those them here again as this article is about the show.</p><p>The scene I propose will occur between Jon and Sansa may also explain why things were downplayed in the one between him and Dany. \u00a0I think the emotional baring of the soul by Jon\u2019s in regards to the truth about his heritage, the fact that he was killed by his men and an examination of his scars both of the physical and mental variety will take place between him and Sansa. \u00a0The examination of both their scars will be between them and I am of the opinion that this is the emotional scene David Nutter referenced in the EW interview.</p><p>If as I proposed there is a romantic encounter between Jon and Sansa that harkens back to the one between Ned and Cat from episode one, then I think that just as Luwin knocked on the door of the Lord\u2019s Chamber after N&amp;C made love, Sam will do the same with the younger Starks. \u00a0Like with Luwin, Sam will come bearing a scroll with bad news. \u00a0And I think that it will turn out to be this scroll that Sophie was referring to in her interview. \u00a0</p><p>However, unlike the one from Lysa, it won\u2019t arrive via a raven. \u00a0Nonetheless, just as the one from Lysa resulted in Ned, the Lord of the House heading south, I think that the one Sam bears will mean the same thing for Sansa, the current Lady of Winterfell as Jon sends her away for protection. \u00a0I also think that in Kings Landing, we will get to see a reenactment of the tale told by the common folks in the books of how she escaped from the Red Keep.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe dwarf\u2019s wife did the murder with him,\u201d swore an archer in Lord Rowan\u2019s livery. \u201cAfterward, she vanished from the hall in a puff of brimstone,<b> and a ghostly direwolf was seen prowling the Red Keep, blood dripping from his jaws.\u201d</b></p><p><b>A Storm of Swords - Jaime VII</b></p></blockquote><p>If the scroll that Sam bears does not arrive via a raven then the question becomes, where did it come from. \u00a0Well, as I\u2019ve speculated in other posts, I\u2019m of the opinion that it was unknowingly brought to Winterfell by Sam himself. \u00a0In fact, I suspect that it is the very same scroll that Sam is shown stealing in the scene below of when he left the Citadel. \u00a0You can find the specific theft at the 2:07 mark.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2F1ueJGz6c5g0\"><iframe width=\"540\"

And now we find out from Sophie and Maisie\u2019s interview that a scroll will play an important role in the final season. \u00a0I don\u2019t know about you but I\u2019m adding 1 and 1 and getting 2. \u00a0</p><p>To add more fire to my theory, consider the photo released of Jorah and Dany standing in what looks to be an office with a shelf filled with scrolls behind them. \u00a0Just happenstance? \u00a0I say not. \u00a0I suspect that this is the same office that Sam has been using since he came to Winterfell and knowing him, he most likely just stashed the scroll he took from the Citadel in with the ones already on the shelf with plans to look at it later.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1758\" data-orig-height=\"1168\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/622884f3b4373c768926bf7d0632359e/tumblr_inline_pp8w4olLDf1scj86c_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1758\" data-orig-height=\"1168\"></figure><p>Now if I\u2019m right and the scroll in question is the one Sam stole, the size of it suggests that it is not the type that usually bears a message. \u00a0The fact that it was taken from the Citadel also indicates that it contains old and possibly even truly ancient knowledge. \u00a0If so, then it most likely has something to do with the mystery surrounding the Night King and the White Walkers.</p><p>Things get even more interesting when you consider the fact that Sophie\u2019s comment about the scroll being given to her as a memento of her time on the show strongly suggests that whatever is in it has to do with the character of Sansa Stark. \u00a0The obvious question then becomes, why would an ancient scroll about the Night King have something to do with Sansa? \u00a0Nothing would be the obvious answer! \u00a0Unless that is, the scroll in question has something to do with the Corpse Queen.</p><p>The story of the Night\u2019s King is also the story of the Corpse Queen. \u00a0The two go hand in hand. \u00a0In this instance, I am talking about the book version and not the Night King from the show. \u00a0However, as his tale in the books is knotted to that of his queen, I believe that there also must be one on the show.</p><p>Many in the fandom have proposed that because white has been introduced into Dany\u2019s costume in such a way as to promote the idea of her as the Night\u2019s Queen (the fandom name for the Corpse Queen), it must mean that she is the one that the NK is after. \u00a0I for one think that is just the writers working to throw people of the true trail. \u00a0The Corpse Queen is ice not fire. \u00a0</p><p>The only two remaining female characters on the show that fulfill the necessary criteria are Arya and Sansa. \u00a0I happen to think that the elder Stark daughter with her \u201ckissed by fire\u201d hair will turn out to be queen in more ways than one. \u00a0And as I proposed in this <a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/173321285156/beric-dondarrion-will-give-the-kiss-of-life-to\" target=\"_blank\"><b>essay</b></a> about her kidnapping by Cersei, Beric will give her the \u201ckiss of life.\u201d \u00a0Sansa will literally have been kissed by fire when Beric brings her back.\u00a0 Hence, when she ascends to the throne\u2026whether of all of Westeros or just of the North, she will for all intents and purposes be the Corpse Queen.</p><p>Now, I have to say that I strongly think that things will play out in a totally different manner in the books. \u00a0I\u2019m not saying that Sansa won\u2019t be the modern day version of the Corpse Queen. \u00a0I think that will also be the case in the books. \u00a0However, I think that the seeds George sprinkles in his garden to get there will be much different than Dan and Dave.</p><p>Before I end, I want to mention a couple of other callbacks I think will play out in the final season. \u00a0Based on the trailer, I would not be surprise to see a version of the scene between Ned and Cat in the Godswood from the first episode. \u00a0We don\u2019t see Sansa in the shot of Jon by the weirwood tree but I suspect that she is either sitting on the limb and Jon\u2019s body is hiding her or else, she will approaching him just as Cat did to Ned as he was cleaning Ice. \u00a0</p><p>I also think that the scene of Dany approaching Jon in the crypts is a call back to Ned and Robert visiting Lyanna\u2019s statue in season one. \u00a0While the obvious thought is that Jon is standing in front of the statue, I\u2019m not quite sure that is the case because as @<a href=\"https://thelawyerthatwaspromised.tumblr.com/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank\" target=\"_blank\">thelawyerthatwaspromised</a> pointed out in her breakdown essay of the scene, Dany\u2019s approach from the other side of the crypt does not match up with the location of Lyanna\u2019s statue (unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t find the essay in question to post a link). \u00a0It\u2019s possible that the positioning of the statue is a mistake on the part of the show but I doubt it. \u00a0</p><p>I don\u2019t know the reason but even if he is not standing in front of his mother\u2019s statue in the trailer, I suspect that he and Dany will still have a conversation in front of it.\u00a0 It is here that I suspect Jon and Dany will have the conversation about her burning Sam\u2019s father and brother.\u00a0 Her face as she approaches him is filled with trepidation.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1746\" data-orig-height=\"866\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c22a3e42a767855b8696e5932b20fe0e/tumblr_inline_pp8wt0I4HP1scj86c_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1746\" data-orig-height=\"866\"></figure><p>What she did to Sam\u2019s family and the other men who didn\u2019t bend the knee is partially why just as Ned did not tell Robert the truth in that the moment, Jon also will not reveal his true identity to Dany.\u00a0 He will fear the danger the revelation could mean to him and his family as well as the effect her potential actions could have on the battle against the White Walkers. \u00a0Plus, he has no interest in the Iron Throne.</p><p>As I said at the beginning, this is purely a speculative essay but with the many callbacks expected, it\u2019s quite possible that some of these scenarios I proposed might indeed play out.</p>",

She also gets out of the bed naked in front of Luwin after he arrives with the scroll. \u00a0When Ned comments that she is embarrassing the maester, she responds that he has birth all her children and so has seen everything she has to offer on multiple occasions.</p><p>After reading Lysa\u2019s note, Ned decides to accept Robert\u2019s request that he become the Hand of the King. \u00a0On the show, Cat is resistant to him going while in the books, she encourages him to do so. \u00a0In both instances, she is looking to protect her family. \u00a0And so Ned heads to Kings Landing with the king where he meets his death and his family\u2019s life is all but destroyed as a result. \u00a0As a callback, I think that we may get a similar scene this season involving a scroll but it won\u2019t be one that comes via a raven.</p><p>Many of us have speculated on the possibility of something of a romantic nature happening in the Lord\u2019s Chamber between Jon and Sansa. \u00a0For myself, I\u2019ve felt that it was a strong possibility since the writers made a point of letting the audience know that Jon had arranged for her to have the suite\u2026especially as it was done in the same scene that he gave her that longing forehead kiss. My theory is that once the truth about Jon\u2019s identity comes out, the emotional scene that David Nutter mentioned will occur between him and Sansa in the Lord\u2019s Chamber and it will lead to them making love.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe fans will not be let down,\u201d says director David Nutter. \u201cThere are a lot of firsts in these episodes. There\u2019s the funniest sequence I\u2019ve ever shot on this show, <b>the most emotional and compelling scene I\u2019ve ever shot</b>, and there\u2019s one scene where there\u2019s so many [major characters] together it feels like you\u2019re watching a superhero movie.\u201d-<b>David Nutter, Entertainment Weekly</b></p></blockquote><p>I think this for several reasons. \u00a0First, as I\u2019ve mentioned, with all the callbacks to the first episode, it makes sense that there is one of the scene between Ned and Cat in the Lord\u2019s Chamber as it was so important to the story. \u00a0Secondly, Sansa having a romantic encounter with a man who loves her for herself and not her inheritance has been part of her character arc in both on the show and in the books. \u00a0On the show, Petyr sold her to the Boltons and we all know what happened there. \u00a0Unfortunately, I don\u2019t rule out something similar happening in the Vale from either Petyr or Harry the Heir. \u00a0It maybe just an attempt but I definitely can see it happening. </p><p>Since she escaped from Ramsay\u2019s clutches on the show, Sansa has been understandably protecting herself both mentally and physically. \u00a0Part of this self-protection is reflected in how she dresses. \u00a0She is always covered from head to toe and she dresses in clothing that are difficult to take off. \u00a0Even her hands are not available for anyone to touch. \u00a0The only people who have been allowed to touch any part of her have been her family when she reunited with them. \u00a0These have included a few notable moments with Jon\u2014when she grabs his hand and most notably when he gave her the forehead kiss. \u00a0</p><p>A part of Sansa\u2019s arc has also been about learning to trust again and to allow a man in. \u00a0It is without a doubt not the only part of her arc and it is not even the most important. \u00a0Nevertheless, it is an aspect of her story and the likelihood of a romantic encounter between her and a man has been percolating throughout her arc. \u00a0The only question is with whom. \u00a0</p><p>Unlike what some think, it won\u2019t be with the Hound as in my opinion, his part in her story\u2026especially in the books will ultimately be shown to be about Jon or at least Jon as he will be upon his return. \u00a0The Hound\u2019s savage nature reflects what Jon will be like when he returns from the dead after his consciousness spends some time in Ghost. \u00a0I think it\u2019s why Martin gave him a moniker reminiscent of a wolfhound. \u00a0And as Sansa tempered the Hound, she will temper Jon. \u00a0Plus, Sandor Clegane is old enough to be Sansa\u2019s father and relationships between older men and girls young enough to be their daughters are one that George\u2019s writings shows to be abhorrent and must end. </p><p>It also won\u2019t be Tyrion for too many reasons to list\u2026least of all being that Sansa would never join with a Lannister after what they did to her family. \u00a0Plus, that is not the story either George or D&amp;D have been writing. \u00a0And it most certainly won\u2019t be Gendry or Pod\u2026two men she doesn\u2019t know. \u00a0In my book, this only leaves Jon. \u00a0A romantic relationship between the two has been hinted at in both the books and show. \u00a0And as there are only 6 episodes left, it has to happen this season. \u00a0</p><p>We also need to remember that this is <i>Game of Thrones</i> that we are talking about and the writers like to throw sex at the audience. \u00a0 With war and almost certain death looming for most of our heroes, it\u2019s almost guaranteed that there will be at least one this year as well and I suspect it will be the most important one of the entire series. \u00a0Making love and connecting to another human being before going off to war is a popular trope in both literature and the visual medium. \u00a0When one knows that one is facing death, it forces you to deal and acknowledge what is most important. \u00a0</p><p>Another reason I think that there will be a romantic encounter between the two eldest remaining Starks in the Lord\u2019s Chamber is because since they reunited, D&amp;D has written them with the angst George described in his original outline for Jon and Arya. \u00a0And so it seems possible to me that based on D&amp;D\u2019s writing George quite likely switched things up with the sisters. \u00a0There are many great metas out there that breakdown the many book clues point to a potential romantic relationship between Jon and Sansa and so there is no need to delve into those them here again as this article is about the show.</p><p>The scene I propose will occur between Jon and Sansa may also explain why things were downplayed in the one between him and Dany. \u00a0I think the emotional baring of the soul by Jon\u2019s in regards to the truth about his heritage, the fact that he was killed by his men and an examination of his scars both of the physical and mental variety will take place between him and Sansa. \u00a0The examination of both their scars will be between them and I am of the opinion that this is the emotional scene David Nutter referenced in the EW interview.</p><p>If as I proposed there is a romantic encounter between Jon and Sansa that harkens back to the one between Ned and Cat from episode one, then I think that just as Luwin knocked on the door of the Lord\u2019s Chamber after N&amp;C made love, Sam will do the same with the younger Starks. \u00a0Like with Luwin, Sam will come bearing a scroll with bad news. \u00a0And I think that it will turn out to be this scroll that Sophie was referring to in her interview. \u00a0</p><p>However, unlike the one from Lysa, it won\u2019t arrive via a raven. \u00a0Nonetheless, just as the one from Lysa resulted in Ned, the Lord of the House heading south, I think that the one Sam bears will mean the same thing for Sansa, the current Lady of Winterfell as Jon sends her away for protection. \u00a0I also think that in Kings Landing, we will get to see a reenactment of the tale told by the common folks in the books of how she escaped from the Red Keep.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe dwarf\u2019s wife did the murder with him,\u201d swore an archer in Lord Rowan\u2019s livery. \u201cAfterward, she vanished from the hall in a puff of brimstone,<b> and a ghostly direwolf was seen prowling the Red Keep, blood dripping from his jaws.\u201d</b></p><p><b>A Storm of Swords - Jaime VII</b></p></blockquote><p>If the scroll that Sam bears does not arrive via a raven then the question becomes, where did it come from. \u00a0Well, as I\u2019ve speculated in other posts, I\u2019m of the opinion that it was unknowingly brought to Winterfell by Sam himself. \u00a0In fact, I suspect that it is the very same scroll that Sam is shown stealing in the scene below of when he left the Citadel. \u00a0You can find the specific theft at the 2:07 mark.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2F1ueJGz6c5g0\"><iframe width=\"540\"

\u00a0I say not. \u00a0I suspect that this is the same office that Sam has been using since he came to Winterfell and knowing him, he most likely just stashed the scroll he took from the Citadel in with the ones already on the shelf with plans to look at it later.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1758\" data-orig-height=\"1168\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/622884f3b4373c768926bf7d0632359e/tumblr_inline_pp8w4olLDf1scj86c_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1758\" data-orig-height=\"1168\"></figure><p>Now if I\u2019m right and the scroll in question is the one Sam stole, the size of it suggests that it is not the type that usually bears a message. \u00a0The fact that it was taken from the Citadel also indicates that it contains old and possibly even truly ancient knowledge. \u00a0If so, then it most likely has something to do with the mystery surrounding the Night King and the White Walkers.</p><p>Things get even more interesting when you consider the fact that Sophie\u2019s comment about the scroll being given to her as a memento of her time on the show strongly suggests that whatever is in it has to do with the character of Sansa Stark. \u00a0The obvious question then becomes, why would an ancient scroll about the Night King have something to do with Sansa? \u00a0Nothing would be the obvious answer! \u00a0Unless that is, the scroll in question has something to do with the Corpse Queen.</p><p>The story of the Night\u2019s King is also the story of the Corpse Queen. \u00a0The two go hand in hand. \u00a0In this instance, I am talking about the book version and not the Night King from the show. \u00a0However, as his tale in the books is knotted to that of his queen, I believe that there also must be one on the show.</p><p>Many in the fandom have proposed that because white has been introduced into Dany\u2019s costume in such a way as to promote the idea of her as the Night\u2019s Queen (the fandom name for the Corpse Queen), it must mean that she is the one that the NK is after. \u00a0I for one think that is just the writers working to throw people of the true trail. \u00a0The Corpse Queen is ice not fire. \u00a0</p><p>The only two remaining female characters on the show that fulfill the necessary criteria are Arya and Sansa. \u00a0I happen to think that the elder Stark daughter with her \u201ckissed by fire\u201d hair will turn out to be queen in more ways than one. \u00a0And as I proposed in this <a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/173321285156/beric-dondarrion-will-give-the-kiss-of-life-to\" target=\"_blank\"><b>essay</b></a> about her kidnapping by Cersei, Beric will give her the \u201ckiss of life.\u201d \u00a0Sansa will literally have been kissed by fire when Beric brings her back.\u00a0 Hence, when she ascends to the throne\u2026whether of all of Westeros or just of the North, she will for all intents and purposes be the Corpse Queen.</p><p>Now, I have to say that I strongly think that things will play out in a totally different manner in the books. \u00a0I\u2019m not saying that Sansa won\u2019t be the modern day version of the Corpse Queen. \u00a0I think that will also be the case in the books. \u00a0However, I think that the seeds George sprinkles in his garden to get there will be much different than Dan and Dave.</p><p>Before I end, I want to mention a couple of other callbacks I think will play out in the final season. \u00a0Based on the trailer, I would not be surprise to see a version of the scene between Ned and Cat in the Godswood from the first episode. \u00a0We don\u2019t see Sansa in the shot of Jon by the weirwood tree but I suspect that she is either sitting on the limb and Jon\u2019s body is hiding her or else, she will approaching him just as Cat did to Ned as he was cleaning Ice. \u00a0</p><p>I also think that the scene of Dany approaching Jon in the crypts is a call back to Ned and Robert visiting Lyanna\u2019s statue in season one. \u00a0While the obvious thought is that Jon is standing in front of the statue, I\u2019m not quite sure that is the case because as @<a href=\"https://thelawyerthatwaspromised.tumblr.com/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank\" target=\"_blank\">thelawyerthatwaspromised</a> pointed out in her breakdown essay of the scene, Dany\u2019s approach from the other side of the crypt does not match up with the location of Lyanna\u2019s statue (unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t find the essay in question to post a link). \u00a0It\u2019s possible that the positioning of the statue is a mistake on the part of the show but I doubt it. \u00a0</p><p>I don\u2019t know the reason but even if he is not standing in front of his mother\u2019s statue in the trailer, I suspect that he and Dany will still have a conversation in front of it.\u00a0 It is here that I suspect Jon and Dany will have the conversation about her burning Sam\u2019s father and brother.\u00a0 Her face as she approaches him is filled with trepidation.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1746\" data-orig-height=\"866\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c22a3e42a767855b8696e5932b20fe0e/tumblr_inline_pp8wt0I4HP1scj86c_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1746\" data-orig-height=\"866\"></figure><p>What she did to Sam\u2019s family and the other men who didn\u2019t bend the knee is partially why just as Ned did not tell Robert the truth in that the moment, Jon also will not reveal his true identity to Dany.\u00a0 He will fear the danger the revelation could mean to him and his family as well as the effect her potential actions could have on the battle against the White Walkers. \u00a0Plus, he has no interest in the Iron Throne.</p><p>As I said at the beginning, this is purely a speculative essay but with the many callbacks expected, it\u2019s quite possible that some of these scenarios I proposed might indeed play out.</p>",
                "content": "<p>March 31, 2019</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c9f42be80a91bffdd47ae15bb5aa84d0/tumblr_inline_pp8vuj5ER11scj86c_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>This is a speculative essay about the final season of Game of Thrones and it discusses some of the cast and crew interviews leading up to the premier of the show. &nbsp;I will read interviews by the actors as a show or movie is about to premier but I also like to avoid learning about any specific spoilers. &nbsp;By definition, discussing these interviews is not really talking about spoilers but one cannot ignore that sometimes actors or crewmembers do inadvertently make comments that could point to the potential direction of a story. &nbsp;As I know not everyone will have read the articles and some may not want to know what the actors said, the rest of this discussion will take place under the cut. &nbsp;If you proceed, do so with the understanding that the subject is about &ldquo;potential spoilers.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>I&rsquo;m intrigue by the season 8 photo of Sansa posted above. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s possible that it is from an indoor scene but I tend to think that it&rsquo;s outdoors. &nbsp;However, it&rsquo;s hard to say definitively. &nbsp;To me, it looks like she could possibly be standing in front of a tent or one being set up and that&rsquo;s part of the reason I find the photo so intriguing. &nbsp;It makes me wonder whether it is an image of Sansa away from Winterfell.</p><p>Of course, if it is a tent, it does not mean that it is not one in the vicinity of Winterfell. &nbsp;There are a lot of troops arrayed outside the castle and so it could be that she is just visiting the camp with Jon and or other leaders to give the troops encouragement before the great battle. &nbsp;Nonetheless, I can&rsquo;t help but extrapolate out based on comments made by the actors, directors and writers in interviews during the publicity rounds for the season premier.</p><p>When I first speculated <b><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/183245767101/beric-dondarrion-will-give-the-kiss-of-life-to\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></b> that Cersei would send the Golden Company north to kidnap Sansa, I suggested that it would happen when Jon sends her away from Winterfell to White Harbor or the Vale for her protection. &nbsp;I still think that might be how things play out. &nbsp;In fact, after reading various interviews I&rsquo;m now more incline to think that will be the case. &nbsp;A final confrontation between Cersei and Sansa is also a plot thread that has been hanging since season five and while I don&rsquo;t expect them to meet again in the books, it seems like a foregone conclusion that they will on the show.</p><p>For this reason, I&rsquo;m wondering if the photo of Sansa with what could possibly be a soup bowl in her hand is of her on the road to the Vale and if the scene potentially occurs right before her retinue is attacked by the Golden Company. &nbsp;The item in her hand does not quite look like a soup bowl&mdash;at least not one that would be used by the lords and ladies of the realm. &nbsp;However, it might be one used by common soldiers and so it&rsquo;s possible that it is one of them who offer her soup. &nbsp;This is of course pure speculation on my part and so the scene could be of something totally different. </p><p>The actors and those behind the show have stated that there will be a lot of callbacks to the first episode of the series and we can already see this will be the case from the trailer. &nbsp;Arya is in Wintertown as Dany arrives just as she was in episode one when Robert came to Winterfell. &nbsp;There is a young boy shown from a roof looking at the army as it arrives just as Bran watched the knights of Robert&rsquo;s court. &nbsp;As an aside, I fully expect bad things to happen to the little boy as it did to Bran. &nbsp;And of course, Sansa greets Dany as Ned welcomed King Robert and hands Winterfell over to her for the duration of her stay.</p><p>With so many callbacks shown in the trailer, it&rsquo;s to be expected that there will be more in the actual show. &nbsp;In point of fact, I expect there to be a callback to one of the two most important scenes from the first episode of the series, and which also jumpstarted the entire story. &nbsp; I am of course talking of Cat receiving the scroll from Lysa and the message stated therein.</p><p>The scene took place in the Lord&rsquo;s Chamber. &nbsp;Ned and Cat were lying in bed after making love when Maester Luwin arrived with the scroll from Lysa saying that the Lannisters murdered her husband. &nbsp;On the show, the Lord and Lady of Winterfell are in robes and so it is not as obvious as on the pages that they had just made love. &nbsp;In the books, we get the end of the encounter and Cat thoughts about it. She also gets out of the bed naked in front of Luwin after he arrives with the scroll. &nbsp;When Ned comments that she is embarrassing the maester, she responds that he has birth all her children and so has seen everything she has to offer on multiple occasions.</p><p>After reading Lysa&rsquo;s note, Ned decides to accept Robert&rsquo;s request that he become the Hand of the King. &nbsp;On the show, Cat is resistant to him going while in the books, she encourages him to do so. &nbsp;In both instances, she is looking to protect her family. &nbsp;And so Ned heads to Kings Landing with the king where he meets his death and his family&rsquo;s life is all but destroyed as a result. &nbsp;As a callback, I think that we may get a similar scene this season involving a scroll but it won&rsquo;t be one that comes via a raven.</p><p>Many of us have speculated on the possibility of something of a romantic nature happening in the Lord&rsquo;s Chamber between Jon and Sansa. &nbsp;For myself, I&rsquo;ve felt that it was a strong possibility since the writers made a point of letting the audience know that Jon had arranged for her to have the suite&hellip;especially as it was done in the same scene that he gave her that longing forehead kiss. My theory is that once the truth about Jon&rsquo;s identity comes out, the emotional scene that David Nutter mentioned will occur between him and Sansa in the Lord&rsquo;s Chamber and it will lead to them making love.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The fans will not be let down,&rdquo; says director David Nutter. &ldquo;There are a lot of firsts in these episodes. There&rsquo;s the funniest sequence I&rsquo;ve ever shot on this show, <b>the most emotional and compelling scene I&rsquo;ve ever shot</b>, and there&rsquo;s one scene where there&rsquo;s so many [major characters] together it feels like you&rsquo;re watching a superhero movie.&rdquo;-<b>David Nutter, Entertainment Weekly</b></p></blockquote><p>I think this for several reasons. &nbsp;First, as I&rsquo;ve mentioned, with all the callbacks to the first episode, it makes sense that there is one of the scene between Ned and Cat in the Lord&rsquo;s Chamber as it was so important to the story. &nbsp;Secondly, Sansa having a romantic encounter with a man who loves her for herself and not her inheritance has been part of her character arc in both on the show and in the books. &nbsp;On the show, Petyr sold her to the Boltons and we all know what happened there. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t rule out something similar happening in the Vale from either Petyr or Harry the Heir. &nbsp;It maybe just an attempt but I definitely can see it happening. </p><p>Since she escaped from Ramsay&rsquo;s clutches on the show, Sansa has been understandably protecting herself both mentally and physically. &nbsp;Part of this self-protection is reflected in how she dresses. &nbsp;She is always covered from head to toe and she dresses in clothing that are difficult to take off. &nbsp;Even her hands are not available for anyone to touch. &nbsp;The only people who have been allowed to touch any part of her have been her family when she reunited with them. &nbsp;These have included a few notable moments with Jon&mdash;when she grabs his hand and most notably when he gave her the forehead kiss. &nbsp;</p><p>A part of Sansa&rsquo;s arc has also been about learning to trust again and to allow a man in. &nbsp;It is without a doubt not the only part of her arc and it is not even the most important. &nbsp;Nevertheless, it is an aspect of her story and the likelihood of a romantic encounter between her and a man has been percolating throughout her arc. &nbsp;The only question is with whom. &nbsp;</p><p>Unlike what some think, it won&rsquo;t be with the Hound as in my opinion, his part in her story&hellip;especially in the books will ultimately be shown to be about Jon or at least Jon as he will be upon his return. &nbsp;The Hound&rsquo;s savage nature reflects what Jon will be like when he returns from the dead after his consciousness spends some time in Ghost. &nbsp;I think it&rsquo;s why Martin gave him a moniker reminiscent of a wolfhound. &nbsp;And as Sansa tempered the Hound, she will temper Jon. &nbsp;Plus, Sandor Clegane is old enough to be Sansa&rsquo;s father and relationships between older men and girls young enough to be their daughters are one that George&rsquo;s writings shows to be abhorrent and must end. </p><p>It also won&rsquo;t be Tyrion for too many reasons to list&hellip;least of all being that Sansa would never join with a Lannister after what they did to her family. &nbsp;Plus, that is not the story either George or D&amp;D have been writing. &nbsp;And it most certainly won&rsquo;t be Gendry or Pod&hellip;two men she doesn&rsquo;t know. &nbsp;In my book, this only leaves Jon. &nbsp;A romantic relationship between the two has been hinted at in both the books and show. &nbsp;And as there are only 6 episodes left, it has to happen this season. &nbsp;</p><p>We also need to remember that this is <i>Game of Thrones</i> that we are talking about and the writers like to throw sex at the audience. &nbsp;

&nbsp;Nothing would be the obvious answer! &nbsp;Unless that is, the scroll in question has something to do with the Corpse Queen.</p><p>The story of the Night&rsquo;s King is also the story of the Corpse Queen. &nbsp;The two go hand in hand. &nbsp;In this instance, I am talking about the book version and not the Night King from the show. &nbsp;However, as his tale in the books is knotted to that of his queen, I believe that there also must be one on the show.</p><p>Many in the fandom have proposed that because white has been introduced into Dany&rsquo;s costume in such a way as to promote the idea of her as the Night&rsquo;s Queen (the fandom name for the Corpse Queen), it must mean that she is the one that the NK is after. &nbsp;I for one think that is just the writers working to throw people of the true trail. &nbsp;The Corpse Queen is ice not fire. &nbsp;</p><p>The only two remaining female characters on the show that fulfill the necessary criteria are Arya and Sansa. &nbsp;I happen to think that the elder Stark daughter with her &ldquo;kissed by fire&rdquo; hair will turn out to be queen in more ways than one. &nbsp;And as I proposed in this <a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/173321285156/beric-dondarrion-will-give-the-kiss-of-life-to\" target=\"_blank\"><b>essay</b></a> about her kidnapping by Cersei, Beric will give her the &ldquo;kiss of life.&rdquo; &nbsp;Sansa will literally have been kissed by fire when Beric brings her back.&nbsp; Hence, when she ascends to the throne&hellip;whether of all of Westeros or just of the North, she will for all intents and purposes be the Corpse Queen.</p><p>Now, I have to say that I strongly think that things will play out in a totally different manner in the books. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not saying that Sansa won&rsquo;t be the modern day version of the Corpse Queen. &nbsp;I think that will also be the case in the books. &nbsp;However, I think that the seeds George sprinkles in his garden to get there will be much different than Dan and Dave.</p><p>Before I end, I want to mention a couple of other callbacks I think will play out in the final season. &nbsp;Based on the trailer, I would not be surprise to see a version of the scene between Ned and Cat in the Godswood from the first episode. &nbsp;We don&rsquo;t see Sansa in the shot of Jon by the weirwood tree but I suspect that she is either sitting on the limb and Jon&rsquo;s body is hiding her or else, she will approaching him just as Cat did to Ned as he was cleaning Ice. &nbsp;</p><p>I also think that the scene of Dany approaching Jon in the crypts is a call back to Ned and Robert visiting Lyanna&rsquo;s statue in season one. &nbsp;While the obvious thought is that Jon is standing in front of the statue, I&rsquo;m not quite sure that is the case because as @<a href=\"https://thelawyerthatwaspromised.tumblr.com/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank\" target=\"_blank\">thelawyerthatwaspromised</a> pointed out in her breakdown essay of the scene, Dany&rsquo;s approach from the other side of the crypt does not match up with the location of Lyanna&rsquo;s statue (unfortunately, I couldn&rsquo;t find the essay in question to post a link). &nbsp;It&rsquo;s possible that the positioning of the statue is a mistake on the part of the show but I doubt it. &nbsp;</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know the reason but even if he is not standing in front of his mother&rsquo;s statue in the trailer, I suspect that he and Dany will still have a conversation in front of it.&nbsp; It is here that I suspect Jon and Dany will have the conversation about her burning Sam&rsquo;s father and brother.&nbsp; Her face as she approaches him is filled with trepidation.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c22a3e42a767855b8696e5932b20fe0e/tumblr_inline_pp8wt0I4HP1scj86c_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>What she did to Sam&rsquo;s family and the other men who didn&rsquo;t bend the knee is partially why just as Ned did not tell Robert the truth in that the moment, Jon also will not reveal his true identity to Dany.&nbsp; He will fear the danger the revelation could mean to him and his family as well as the effect her potential actions could have on the battle against the White Walkers. &nbsp;Plus, he has no interest in the Iron Throne.</p><p>As I said at the beginning, this is purely a speculative essay but with the many callbacks expected, it&rsquo;s quite possible that some of these scenarios I proposed might indeed play out.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Much has been made of the alliance of Jon and Daenerys on<i> Game of Thrones</i>. \u00a0From a long term perspective, the two coming together was years in the making. \u00a0For six seasons, the audience followed their somewhat parallel journeys as they rose to power: Daenerys as a conqueror who has always had her eye on Westeros, and Jon as a reluctant leader who is given power through more democratic means. \u00a0From the earliest episodes of the show, the two are singled out as being special and even marked by destiny. \u00a0We see that both are touched by <a href=\"https://lupinusalbus.tumblr.com/post/183663595125/jon-and-daenerys-their-magical-animals\">their world\u2019s magic </a>as Jon fortuitously rescues six Direwolf pups and Daenerys makes a blood sacrifice in order to hatch three baby dragons into the cosmos.</p><p>Jon and Dany have made a political and sexual alliance on the show, but also are secretly bound by a blood tie which will soon be revealed. \u00a0In light of their recent physical attachment, the revelation of Jon\u2019s true parentage \u00a0has potentially tragic implications for their relationship. \u00a0There has been speculation and debate about why Jon Snow bent the knee to Daenerys at the end of season 7. \u00a0Over the course of this season, it became clear that Dany had become infatuated with Jon; and this, combined with her encounter with the Army of the Dead fueled her pledge to fight with him. \u00a0Jon then verbally pledges \u00a0 himself (and the North) to Dany. \u00a0It is not entirely clear why he did this, but the plot has foreshadowed that Northerners and the Stark family will not be accepting of Jon\u2019s actions.</p><p>For Daenerys, a romantic union or marriage to Jon Snow has many positive ramifications which may be lulling the audience into anticipating a fairy-tale ending. \u00a0Beyond the obvious political benefits, Jon Snow is a potentially \u00a0good partner for Dany. \u00a0In her past marriage to Khal Drogo, even though the two eventually came to love each other, Dany had to endure many indignities. \u00a0As a very young woman, she was used by her brother as a political pawn and then raped on her wedding day. \u00a0Although Drogo developed a softer side with respect to Dany, he was not an ethically enlightened person. \u00a0The Dothraki (including Drogo) are portrayed as primitives whose \u201cmasculine\u201d\u00a0ethos involves pillage and rape in their raw pursuit of power. \u00a0This is basically what they are all about. \u00a0Although Dany intervenes with Drogo to stop specific acts of rape, this concession from him indirectly leads to his death. \u00a0In addition, although Dany is opposed to rape and slavery, she relies on brutal tactics of her own when she burns the Khals. \u00a0It is through this display of raw power and supernatural\u00a0\u201cfire-proofness\u201d that she gains the support of the Dothraki. \u00a0Her triumph does not happen because the Dothraki have suddenly become politically enlightened.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1100\" data-orig-height=\"624\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9db826f03a8dd3d61b5678129eabb98a/tumblr_inline_pp73vuUrSJ1wx65bx_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1100\" data-orig-height=\"624\"/></figure><p>In any case, Jon Snow as a partner for Dany is ostensibly an advance over Khal Drogo. \u00a0Although Jon is very competent, even exceptional, in the masculine art of\u00a0\u201cfighting\u201d he has never pursued power for it\u2019s own sake. \u00a0In emotionally charged situations where he has been compelled by circumstances to take a life, he often did so reluctantly, and sometimes not at all. \u00a0He also has expressed doubts to others about the lives that he has taken. \u00a0In some sense this \u201ctortured soul\u201d\u00a0quality even seems to be what Dany finds attractive about him, as when Jon gives her pause by admitting that he doesn\u2019t enjoy the things that he is good at. \u00a0While Drogo was no doubt operating within the Dothraki code of honor, his world view was primitive compared to Jon\u2019s more sophisticated conscience.</p><p>Although Dany appears to be a champion of the downtrodden, most of those who have pledged loyalty to her have done so because they had no other choice. \u00a0The unsullied were conditioned to obey whoever held the whip. \u00a0Even though Dany dropped the whip and allowed them certain freedoms, they really had nowhere else to go. \u00a0Likewise, the Dothrhaki were conditioned to follow whomever was able to kill other Khals. \u00a0Dany got her Dothrakis by effecting a mass burning of the leadership in their holy city and also by a raw display of God-like power. \u00a0Even though Dany seems better because she is against slavery and rape, her followers never appear to question her quest for world domination and the means that will be required to achieve it.\u00a0Her means in and of themselves are not very different from what any other leaders have done. \u00a0Although Dany is inspirational in her reputation as a\u00a0\u201cliberator\u201d she is still authoritarian in her desire for domination, which mostly seems to be based upon the Targaryen name and Dragon-power.</p><p>The coming together of Jon and Dany is setting us up for a clash of world views as well as armies. \u00a0In many ways, Jon\u2019s world view is the antithesis of Dany\u2019s. \u00a0Dany\u2019s route to power on<i> Game of Thrones</i> has been\u00a0\u201cpositive\u201d in that she has actively sought her acquisition of armies and wealth to fuel her conquest of Westeros. \u00a0She is very comfortable in the role of receiving obeisance from others since this is all wrapped up in her sense of destiny as The Last Targaryen. She feels that it is all her birthright. \u00a0On the other hand, Jon Snow\u2019s journey to power is\u00a0\u201cnegative\u201d in the sense that he has not sought it for himself. \u00a0His personal qualities have motivated those around him to select him for leadership. \u00a0 After he is resurrected, instead of viewing himself as being destined for something important (as Melisandre hints), his plan is to anonymously head South. \u00a0It is only because Sansa arrives at Castle Black and convinces him to attempt to take Winterfell that he even becomes King in the North. \u00a0So Jon is a person who uses his conscience to do the best that he can when others place their trust in him. \u00a0Rather than pursuing power, he tries to do what is right for its own sake. \u00a0Although it appears on the surface that Jon and Dany\u2019s paths are complementary, they are actually in conflict.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"800\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/639269dd4b7b1d11d6916372729630a4/tumblr_inline_pp78o7BOGn1wx65bx_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"800\"/></figure><p>After Dany destroys a large part of the Lannister forces and burns the Tarlys for refusing to bend the knee to her, she returns to Dragonstone and asks Jon Snow how many men his army killed when he took back Winterfell as if to imply equivalence. \u00a0Except that the two situations are not really equivalent. \u00a0The quest of \u00a0Sansa and Jon to regain Winterfell had a moral dimension that is absent from Dany\u2019s conquest of Westeros. \u00a0Dany\u2019s notion of\u00a0\u201chelping people from a position of strength\u201d really rests on little more than the sense of entitlement she derives from her name and her dragons. \u00a0There is no foundation of moral \u201crightness\u201d,\u00a0\u00a0but rather a cult of personality backing her. \u00a0Her followers, after all, are composed \u00a0primarily of armies of brutally subjugated slaves and tribally minded\u00a0\u201cbloodriders\u201d. \u00a0She really has not proven herself to be worthy of support in Westeros, but is a foreign invader.</p><p>In his relationship with Ygritte and even with Dany, Jon Snow has been portrayed as an object of affection for a more active woman. \u00a0Ygritte made the initial advances in her relationship with Jon, and Dany is shown being more actively interested in Jon than he is in her. \u00a0The interesting part of this is that Dany is actually waylaid from her conquest of Westeros because of her attraction to Jon Snow. \u00a0She loses Viserion because she goes beyond The Wall to rescue Jon, and she unknowingly buys Cersei more time by attempting to enter into a truce with her. \u00a0Dany may be risking everything she has been working \u00a0towards for love and it could lead to her downfall.

that she gains the support of the Dothraki. &nbsp;Her triumph does not happen because the Dothraki have suddenly become politically enlightened.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9db826f03a8dd3d61b5678129eabb98a/tumblr_inline_pp73vuUrSJ1wx65bx_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>In any case, Jon Snow as a partner for Dany is ostensibly an advance over Khal Drogo. &nbsp;Although Jon is very competent, even exceptional, in the masculine art of&nbsp;&ldquo;fighting&rdquo; he has never pursued power for it&rsquo;s own sake. &nbsp;In emotionally charged situations where he has been compelled by circumstances to take a life, he often did so reluctantly, and sometimes not at all. &nbsp;He also has expressed doubts to others about the lives that he has taken. &nbsp;In some sense this &ldquo;tortured soul&rdquo;&nbsp;quality even seems to be what Dany finds attractive about him, as when Jon gives her pause by admitting that he doesn&rsquo;t enjoy the things that he is good at. &nbsp;While Drogo was no doubt operating within the Dothraki code of honor, his world view was primitive compared to Jon&rsquo;s more sophisticated conscience.</p><p>Although Dany appears to be a champion of the downtrodden, most of those who have pledged loyalty to her have done so because they had no other choice. &nbsp;The unsullied were conditioned to obey whoever held the whip. &nbsp;Even though Dany dropped the whip and allowed them certain freedoms, they really had nowhere else to go. &nbsp;Likewise, the Dothrhaki were conditioned to follow whomever was able to kill other Khals. &nbsp;Dany got her Dothrakis by effecting a mass burning of the leadership in their holy city and also by a raw display of God-like power. &nbsp;Even though Dany seems better because she is against slavery and rape, her followers never appear to question her quest for world domination and the means that will be required to achieve it.&nbsp;Her means in and of themselves are not very different from what any other leaders have done. &nbsp;Although Dany is inspirational in her reputation as a&nbsp;&ldquo;liberator&rdquo; she is still authoritarian in her desire for domination, which mostly seems to be based upon the Targaryen name and Dragon-power.</p><p>The coming together of Jon and Dany is setting us up for a clash of world views as well as armies. &nbsp;In many ways, Jon&rsquo;s world view is the antithesis of Dany&rsquo;s. &nbsp;Dany&rsquo;s route to power on<i> Game of Thrones</i> has been&nbsp;&ldquo;positive&rdquo; in that she has actively sought her acquisition of armies and wealth to fuel her conquest of Westeros. &nbsp;She is very comfortable in the role of receiving obeisance from others since this is all wrapped up in her sense of destiny as The Last Targaryen. She feels that it is all her birthright. &nbsp;On the other hand, Jon Snow&rsquo;s journey to power is&nbsp;&ldquo;negative&rdquo; in the sense that he has not sought it for himself. &nbsp;His personal qualities have motivated those around him to select him for leadership. &nbsp; After he is resurrected, instead of viewing himself as being destined for something important (as Melisandre hints), his plan is to anonymously head South. &nbsp;It is only because Sansa arrives at Castle Black and convinces him to attempt to take Winterfell that he even becomes King in the North. &nbsp;So Jon is a person who uses his conscience to do the best that he can when others place their trust in him. &nbsp;Rather than pursuing power, he tries to do what is right for its own sake. &nbsp;Although it appears on the surface that Jon and Dany&rsquo;s paths are complementary, they are actually in conflict.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/639269dd4b7b1d11d6916372729630a4/tumblr_inline_pp78o7BOGn1wx65bx_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>After Dany destroys a large part of the Lannister forces and burns the Tarlys for refusing to bend the knee to her, she returns to Dragonstone and asks Jon Snow how many men his army killed when he took back Winterfell as if to imply equivalence. &nbsp;Except that the two situations are not really equivalent. &nbsp;The quest of &nbsp;Sansa and Jon to regain Winterfell had a moral dimension that is absent from Dany&rsquo;s conquest of Westeros. &nbsp;Dany&rsquo;s notion of&nbsp;&ldquo;helping people from a position of strength&rdquo; really rests on little more than the sense of entitlement she derives from her name and her dragons. &nbsp;There is no foundation of moral &ldquo;rightness&rdquo;,&nbsp;&nbsp;but rather a cult of personality backing her. &nbsp;Her followers, after all, are composed &nbsp;primarily of armies of brutally subjugated slaves and tribally minded&nbsp;&ldquo;bloodriders&rdquo;. &nbsp;She really has not proven herself to be worthy of support in Westeros, but is a foreign invader.</p><p>In his relationship with Ygritte and even with Dany, Jon Snow has been portrayed as an object of affection for a more active woman. &nbsp;Ygritte made the initial advances in her relationship with Jon, and Dany is shown being more actively interested in Jon than he is in her. &nbsp;The interesting part of this is that Dany is actually waylaid from her conquest of Westeros because of her attraction to Jon Snow. &nbsp;She loses Viserion because she goes beyond The Wall to rescue Jon, and she unknowingly buys Cersei more time by attempting to enter into a truce with her. &nbsp;Dany may be risking everything she has been working &nbsp;towards for love and it could lead to her downfall. Although Jon is certainly on dangerous ground by forming an alliance with Dany, this is also true for her.</p><p>How could her downfall happen? &nbsp;One wild card will be how Jon&rsquo;s reaction to finding out about his true ancestry will affect their relationship. &nbsp;Another is the reaction of the people around Jon and Dany to the truth about Jon. &nbsp;Tyron and Varys have expressed reservations about Dany&rsquo;s execution of the Tarlys and it seems likely that this situation is going to come to a head early in Season 8, as Jon and Daenerys come into contact with Samwell Tarly at Winterfell. &nbsp; It may be a catalyst for a serious rift in their relationship and is also fertile ground for their clashing world views to play out with very dramatic consequences. &nbsp;If she breaks with Jon and/or circumstances force her to retreat back to Dragonstone, her armies will still be vulnerable to attack from Cersei, and Dany would be seriously weakened and vulnerable.&nbsp;</p><p>For the general audience, Jon and Daenerys are the protagonists of <i>Game of Thrones</i>; they are the&nbsp;&ldquo;good guys.&rdquo; Exactly how the show will portray a rift between the two will be fascinating. &nbsp;Many have speculated that Westeros is headed for the abolishment of the Iron Throne as somehow ushered in by Jon Snow, the new Aegon. &nbsp;The character development of both Jon and Dany, with their&nbsp;&ldquo;negative&rdquo; and&nbsp;&ldquo;positive&rdquo; paths to the conclusion of the series is one way of looking at where the plot will go. &nbsp;A victory by Daenerys is not really very groundbreaking, whereas the ascension of Jon (or at least his ethos) would actually represent a step forward for the seven kingdoms.</p><hr /></p>",
