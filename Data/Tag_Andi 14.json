You get to know some cool people sometimes, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Cyrus replied, ever the conversationalist. \u201cI, uh, my friend wasn\u2019t able to make it with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotcha.\u201d</p><p>A beat of awkward silence, and then the boy added, \u201cMy candy offer is still up for grabs, just for the record.\u201d</p><p><i>Why the hell not?</i> Cyrus sighed, \u201cSure. Hey, do you want some of my pretzel sticks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good, but thanks,\u201d the boy responded, a soft grin on his face. \u201cI\u2019m TJ, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus.\u201d</p><p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p><p>The musical was amazing, as expected. Cyrus didn\u2019t think it could top the soundtrack by that much, but it was probably one of the favorite nights of his life.</p><p>Sighing contently, Cyrus walked out the elevator to his hotel room. He was pulling out his room key when he heard a somewhat familiar, \u201cNo way!\u201d</p><p>He turned his head to see TJ standing by the door to the room next to him, and began chuckling. \u201cWell, what do you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019re neighbors, then, huh?\u201d TJ joked.</p><p>\u201cGuess so,\u201d Cyrus replied, a slightly bewildered smile on his face.</p><p>TJ offered, \u201cWould you want to come in and hang out with me for a bit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I know you\u2019re not a serial killer or anything?\u201d Cyrus teased.</p><p>TJ shrugged. \u201cI guess you\u2019ll just have to trust me.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus peered into his room and saw the two empty beds. He knew he would just end up staring at the other bed, trying to fall asleep and wishing he\u2019d gotten to know the \u201ccute musical boy\u201d better. He shut the door. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>They walked in, both sitting on the bed. \u201cSo, are you from around here?\u201d TJ asked.</p><p>Cyrus leaned back, putting his two hands behind him. \u201cNah, I live about five hours away.\u201d</p><p>TJ squinted. \u201cWhat city?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus laughed inwardly, \u201cYou sure you\u2019re not a serial killer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious,\u201d TJ replied, a smile on his face as he leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees.</p><p>\u201cShadyside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re <i>kidding</i>.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus furrowed his eyebrows. \u201cYou know where that is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow it? I\u2019ve lived there my whole life! How\u2019ve I never seen you around before?\u201d TJ exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cI mean, I went to private school when I was younger, maybe that\u2019s it?\u201d Cyrus suggested.</p><p>TJ stood up to grab a water from his cooler. \u201cIt\u2019s gotta be. I would\u2019ve remembered if I\u2019ve met you before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>TJ turned around, smirking. \u201cYou\u2019ve got too pretty of a face for me to forget it,\u201d he said, twirling the water bottle in his hands.</p><p>And if Cyrus wasn\u2019t flustered before, he sure was now.</p><p>\u201cI-wh-um, you- you\u2019ve got a nice face too, I guess,\u201d Cyrus mumbled.</p><p>TJ winced. \u201cI- sorry if that made you uncomfortable, I just thought that\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Cyrus interrupted, a sudden surge of courage overcoming him.</p><p>The two ended up talking about everything and nothing for the following three hours, clicking better than either ever had with anyone else, until Cyrus noticed that it was nearly 2:30 am and he needed to sleep if he was going to drive home tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cShit, I\u2019m really sorry to cut this short, but I\u2019ve gotta go,\u201d Cyrus said, walking up to the door with TJ trailing behind him.</p><p>TJ waved him off. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, it\u2019s not like I\u2019ll never see you again, now that I know we live in the same town, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Cyrus replied with a smile, shutting the door softly as he left the room.</p><p>They both slept better than they had in a long time.</p><p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p><p>Unfortunately, reality has to hit you in the face at some point, and that was when Cyrus realized after he\u2019d gotten home that he never got TJ\u2019s number.</p><p>There would be no rom-com happenings of sorts for him for a while, as they didn\u2019t know where to find each other.</p><p>And yet, a few months after they met, they did.</p><p>Cyrus pushed open the door to the Spoon, about to walk up to the counter to greet Amber and order some baby taters. But, she was already busy talking to someone, someone super familiar.</p><p>\u201cTJ?\u201d</p><p>He turned his head, breaking into a giant grin. \u201cHey, musical guy! I found you!\u201d</p><p>Cyrus quirked an eyebrow. \u201cI hope you didn\u2019t forget my name.\u201d</p><p>TJ tapped Cyrus\u2019 chest. \u201cI could never, Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>Amber cut in, \u201cI hate to interrupt this apparently lovely moment, but Cyrus, how in the <i>hell</i> do you know my little brother?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 eyes almost popped out of his head. \u201cHe\u2019s your brother?\u201d</p><p>Amber sighed, \u201cUnfortunately.\u201d</p><p>Tj nudged her with his shoulder. \u201cYou love me.\u201d</p><p>Amber rolled her eyes, \u201cWhatever. Cyrus, you still haven\u2019t answered my question.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled softly. \u201cI met him at a musical.\u201d</p><p>Amber smirked. \u201cOhhh, so you\u2019re who my baby brother has been obsessing over meeting again for the past few months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmber!\u201d</p><p>Cyrus teased, \u201cYou\u2019ve been obsessing over me?\u201d</p><p>TJ nearly became a strawberry in that instant. \u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t say obsessing\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, TJ. I wanted to see you again, too,\u201d Cyrus interrupted, placing a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>TJ grew nervous, fiddling with his thumbs. \u201cWould you, maybe, want to see me on a date? The coffee shop across the street?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus blushed, smiling softly. \u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, as sweet as this is, I need to work. Scoot over, lovebirds,\u201d Amber teased as she walked over to a table.</p><p>Cyrus and TJ laughed, sharing a look.</p><p>Maybe there were some rom-com happenings after all.</p>",

I found you!\u201d</p><p>Cyrus quirked an eyebrow. \u201cI hope you didn\u2019t forget my name.\u201d</p><p>TJ tapped Cyrus\u2019 chest. \u201cI could never, Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>Amber cut in, \u201cI hate to interrupt this apparently lovely moment, but Cyrus, how in the <i>hell</i> do you know my little brother?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 eyes almost popped out of his head. \u201cHe\u2019s your brother?\u201d</p><p>Amber sighed, \u201cUnfortunately.\u201d</p><p>Tj nudged her with his shoulder. \u201cYou love me.\u201d</p><p>Amber rolled her eyes, \u201cWhatever.

Drying himself off with a towel and changing into his clothes, he headed out the door, nearly running down the street.</p><p>Pushing open the door to the cafe, he was reminded of why he took this job in the first place. There was really nothing better than the smell of coffee to make him feel happy. He slipped on his apron and his nametag, hopping behind the counter and prepping the machines.</p><p>\u201cOh good, you\u2019re here,\u201d Marty said, untying his apron and putting his elbows on the counter.

Your little flirty friend isn\u2019t here to keep you company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, her name\u2019s Buffy,\u201d he started with an exasperated tone, \u201cand second of all, she\u2019s not my flirty friend. She\u2019s just my friend.\u201d</p><p>TJ snorted. \u201cSays the guy who continuously writes pick-up lines on her orders.\u201d</p><p>Marty spotted a few people coming in, and started grabbing a couple of cups, without thinking. \u201cWhen are you going to stop bugging me about my love life and start focusing on yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I find a cute boy, who also likes cute boys,\u201d TJ commented, retying his apron.</p><p>\u201cOh, you think you\u2019re cute, Kippen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d</p><p>Marty shook his head, walking towards the exit. \u201cSee you later.\u201d</p><!-- more --><hr><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to die,\u201d Cyrus groaned, throwing himself onto his bed.</p><p>Buffy took a seat by him, patting his back. \u201cYou won\u2019t die. You say this every semester, Cy, and you always make it through. This week\u2019s gonna be rough, but I promise that you\u2019ll do fine.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus sighed, rolling onto his back and staring at the ceiling. \u201cI\u2019ve never had to write a paper this long before, and I just kept putting it off, and now I only have a week? On top of studying for midterms? I\u2019m going to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust&hellip;go and grab a coffee or something, to, you know, keep you going,\u201d she suggested, and he perked up at that.</p><p>\u201cCome with me?\u201d Cyrus asked, almost pleadingly.</p><p>Buffy hesitated. \u201cI would but&hellip;I kind of already promised someone that I would hang out with them today after classes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have midterms too?\u201d</p><p>Buffy smiled proudly, crossing her arms. \u201cPerks of playing a sport at the collegiate level is that I get to take midterms early. \u2018Cause of the game schedule. It actually works out quite nicely.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus sighed, leaning back against the back of his bed. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make me go and interact with the barista and order a coffee? You know I\u2019m just going to stumble on my own words.\u201d</p><p>She placed a comforting hand on his shoulder, as if to try and reassure him. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be fine. You\u2019ve done it before. Plus, what\u2019s the worst that could happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see a cute boy and short circuit, forget my name, he thinks I have amnesia and he takes me to a hospital where they find out that I have-\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he caught his breath, pinching the bridge of his nose, \u201cdream I had. Fine, I\u2019ll go&hellip;but <i>please</i>, can\u2019t you come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already promised Marty that I\u2019d-\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarty?\u201d Cyrus interrupted her, \u201cyou mean that guy that you\u2019re always flirting with at the coffee shop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not flirting! We\u2019re just friends, and he invited me to go bowling.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smirked, crossing his arms. \u201cAnd are you going with a group of friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no,\u201d she answered, shaking her head, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus waved her off, ushering her out of his room. \u201cYeah, yeah, it\u2019s a date, even if you won\u2019t admit it. Tell me about it afterwards. Also wear a blue shirt, it brings out your eyes.\u201d</p><p>He closed the door before she could say anything else, and started to pack his backpack full of things he would need to work. Normally, he would work in the library, but during midterms week, he always found it either too quiet or too loud. The coffee shop seemed to have the perfect blend of quiet chatter in the background in order to keep him focused on his work, and not allow him to listen to his thoughts. It was a good environment to work in. Probably one of his favorites. He knew he couldn\u2019t stay away no matter if he was alone or with a friend.</p><p>And that\u2019s how Cyrus found himself rushing to coffee shop during the rain, papers in hand, sliding through the door and plopping himself down in his usual seat; a booth near one of the windows. He started setting up his computer, plugging it into the outlet, and turning it on. Pulling out a folder of his, he shuffled through piles of paper to find the one with the assignment. That\u2019s when he decided to go up and order, running a hand through his hair.</p><p>TJ saw the boy approaching, and swore that for a split second, he lost his breath. With his soft brown hair sweeping across his forehead, slightly upturned nose, and rosy complexion, he was, in short, beautiful.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>TJ snapped out of his reverie at the boy\u2019s words. He looked down at him, slightly flushed. \u201cSorry, what can I get for you?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus sighed, squinting up at the menu and then just bowing his head slightly. \u201cCan I just get five espressos, but all in one cup?\u201d</p><p>If TJ were holding a cup in his hand, he would have dropped it. Picking one up from the stack, he started to write on it. \u201cThat\u2019s bound to kill you.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus shrugged with one shoulder, smiling a little bit. \u201cIt\u2019s either that or exams, so I\u2019d rather it be coffee that gives me the sweet release of death.\u201d</p><p>TJ laughed out loud at that, smiling far too widely given what Cyrus said. It wasn\u2019t particularly hilarious, but it sure seemed that way to TJ. Maybe it was just because the boy in front of him was exceptionally cute.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you, going to med school or something?\u201d TJ wondered aloud, scooping some of the coffee grounds into a container.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m a double major,\u201d he replied, leaning against the counter.</p><p>TJ nodded. \u201cAh, the silent killer.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus laughed so hard at that he snorted, immediately flushing a deep shade of red. Oh, Buffy was going to get an earful of this later.</p><p>Meanwhile TJ was trying to keep his composure and not spill the coffee grounds all over the place. Turning on the machine, it started to hum and drip the espresso into a cup. He had to continuously add more grounds to make it to five shots, but he eventually got there. Capping the cup, he slid it over to Cyrus, before noticing the pile of stuff, which he assumed was his, in the corner of the shop.</p><p>\u201cOh shoot, I assumed this was to go, sorry,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>Cyrus waved him off, sliding him the money for the coffee. \u201cThat\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll stay here, keep you company, seeing as there are almost no people here,\u201d he laughed a little.</p><p>TJ ignored him for the moment, focusing intensely on getting the amount of change right, and handing it to the other boy. \u201cDon\u2019t you have studying to do&hellip;I would use your full name, but I don\u2019t even know your first name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Cyrus squinted at his nametag, \u201cTJ, studying can wait. I\u2019m Cyrus, by the way.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus. What a beautiful name to match a beautiful person. \u201cWell, that\u2019s cool then. Maybe I\u2019ll just take my break now,\u201d he decided, walking out from behind the counter.</p><p>During the time that they talked, Cyrus learned that TJ was here on a basketball scholarship, but that he was majoring in psychology, with the intent of becoming a school counselor, and a minor in gender studies.</p><p>\u201cWhat made you wanna minor in that?\u201d Cyrus asked, sipping his all too bitter coffee, and making a face about it.</p><p>TJ smiled shyly, sliding him a couple of sugar packets. \u201cOh, uh, I guess it just sounded cool, or something,\u201d he mumbled, trying to brush it off.</p><p>Cyrus made a mental note to himself that TJ looked cute when he was slightly flustered. \u201cThat\u2019s cool. Sounds really interesting.\u201d</p><p>TJ learned that Cyrus was double majoring in film and journalism, with the intent of either becoming a playwright or a writer. He still didn\u2019t know which one he wanted to pursue; as he sipped his coffee, he seemed to talk faster and faster, which increasingly worried TJ.</p><p>\u201cHang out here for a while, alright?\u201d TJ told him, getting up from his seat, \u201cI\u2019ll walk you back after I finish my shift.\u201d</p><p>Small groups of people filtered in during the rest of TJ\u2019s shift, and he kept an eye on Cyrus all the while, who was typing away on his computer like a mad man. He couldn\u2019t help but smile at that as he made the seemingly endless streams of chai lattes.</p><hr><p>TJ finished up his shift on a good note, and he even had time to clean some of the equipment at the end of his shift, before he hung up his apron in the back room and walked out to where Cyrus was sitting, his leg bouncing uncontrollably. </p><p>\u201cAlright, time to head out,\u201d TJ said, to which Cyrus pouted and shut his laptop, shoving it in his bag.</p><p>\u201cI was so close to finishing my last paper, though!\u201d he whined, getting up and nearly hopping towards the door.</p><p>TJ chuckled, falling in step with him. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll get to finish it once you get back to your dorm&hellip;which I\u2019m just now realizing I don\u2019t know where it is. Care to lead the way?\u201d</p><p>And lead the way he did. Cyrus had never felt more energetic in his life; was this how athletic people felt? It was incredible. He even went up the stairs without feeling completely winded at the top. All the while, TJ was admiring him with a fond smile on his face. He had just met Cyrus this afternoon, but he felt like he\u2019d known him his entire life.</p><p>Once they reached Cyrus\u2019 dorm, his frantic energy seemed to calm down a little, as he opened the door and stood in the threshold, turning to face TJ.</p><p>\u201cThanks for walking me back,\u201d he said, and he was a bit more calm than he\u2019d been previously, \u201cyou didn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>TJ shrugged, putting his hands in his pockets, looking around the room. He saw a small pride flag on one of the tables, but he tried to tell himself it was probably Cyrus\u2019 roommate\u2019s. \u201cBut I <i>wanted </i>to.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to, and Cyrus thought it was so sweet of him. He\u2019d only known TJ for the time that they\u2019d spent at the coffee shop, but he already felt so close to him, like they were best friends. Without thinking, he stepped forward and wrapped his arms around TJ in a hug.</p><p>TJ didn\u2019t really respond for a second; a hug was the last thing he was expecting, and yet, here he was. It was really nice, actually, but by the time TJ had actually started to put his arms around Cyrus, the boy pulled back, mortified, and shut the door.</p><p>TJ waited outside Cyrus\u2019 door for a minute, waiting to see if maybe he\u2019d open it again and talk to him. But after a little while, he left, shaking his head.</p><hr><p>For the next few days, Cyrus avoided the coffee shop like the plague. Buffy came in to get his orders, and by the time she delivered it to him, it was cold because she\u2019d been talking to Marty about their next date.</p><p><i>\u201cYou guys are going out on a date?\u201d Cyrus had exclaimed, his eyes bugging out of his head.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal,\u201d she brushed it off, grabbing a piece of her hair and twirling it around between her fingers.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus took a sip of his coffee, smirking. \u201cOh, please, you\u2019re so smitten with him and you\u2019re excited that he asked you out.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYour words, not mine.\u201d</i></p><p>TJ\u2019s head snapped up every time the bell rang above the door, but he never saw Cyrus enter. He sighed, pouring the milk into the cup before Marty came up by him and snatched it out of his hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d TJ snapped, crossing his arms.</p><p>\u201cThe order is for soy milk, not two percent! Are you trying to actively kill our customers?\u201d Marty carded his fingers through his hair, exasperated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bad with numbers,\u201d TJ mumbled, grabbing a new cup.</p><p>Marty shook his head, taking the cup from TJ\u2019s hands. \u201cYou\u2019re not like this even when you pull an allnighter. What\u2019s going on, dude?\u201d</p><p>TJ sighed, leaning back against the counter. He started to explain everything, from the moment that Cyrus walked in, to when they walked back to his dorm together, to when Cyrus hugged him and them pulled away immediately.</p><p>\u201cThat pretty much brings us up to date,\u201d he said plainly, grabbing a rag and wiping down the counter, while Marty stared at him with wide eyes.</p><p>\u201cJust talk to him, dude,\u201d he told him, nudging him a little, \u201cI\u2019m sure things are still fine between you two.\u201d</p><p>TJ just shrugged, and continued on with his shift like a robot, going through the movements with little effort. The end of his shift came pretty quickly, and he ended up spending some time at the courts shooting hoops, until his phone buzzed.</p><p><b>[Marty: go talk to him or so help me]</b></p><hr><p>Somehow, TJ found himself going up the stairs in Cyrus\u2019 dorm complex, and towards his room. He stood outside the door for a little bit, trying to collect his thoughts and think of something to say that would make sense. Tentatively, he rapped his knuckles on the door and waited.</p><p>Soft footsteps were heard from inside, and Cyrus opened the door. All of TJ\u2019s planning to say something comprehensible went out the window when he saw him; Cyrus was wearing clothes that were way too big for him, and he had glasses on this time.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi,\u201d Cyrus said quietly, snapping TJ out of his thoughts.</p><p>\u201c&hellip;hey,\u201d he mumbled, clearing his throat, \u201ccan I talk to you for a second? If you have a class that\u2019s fine, I can come back later, or-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-I have time right now,\u201d Cyrus cut in, stepping aside and letting TJ in. He shut the door, his head pounding in his chest, and turned around to see TJ sitting on the ground. Cyrus found that amusing and a little bit cute, but he tried to quell that voice in his head. He took a seat by TJ, pulling his knees into his chest.</p><p>\u201cDid I&hellip;do something wrong?\u201d TJ asked quietly, looking down at the ground.</p><p>Cyrus immediately turned to look at him, a worried look etched into his face. \u201cWhat? No! What would make you say that?\u201d</p><p>TJ shrugged, picking at a fray string in the rug. \u201cI&hellip;I don\u2019t know, I guess since I haven\u2019t seen you much around the coffee shop that&hellip;I did something wrong.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus drew in a breath, gnawing on his lower lip. \u201cRight,\u201d he mumbled, \u201cbut&hellip;you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I did.\u201d</p><p>TJ looked up from the ground for the first time, unable to meet Cyrus\u2019 gaze since the other boy was looking up at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus closed his eyes. \u201cAfter you walked me back to my dorm and I just&hellip;hugged you, I wasn\u2019t thinking straight&hellip;sorry.\u201d</p><p>TJ nearly chuckled at \u2018not thinking straight\u2019, but kept a solemn face. \u201cYou think I\u2019m, like, mad at you for that?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus shrugged, opening his eyes and looking at TJ. \u201cI&hellip;guess not mad, but weirded out because I\u2019m-\u201d</p><p>He stopped, not letting any more words flow out of his mouth. He surprised himself in that moment; he almost came out to TJ without so much as a second thought to how he might react.</p><p>TJ seemed to pick up on Cyrus\u2019 discomfort, and shifted a little. \u201cI\u2019m not weirded out, Cyrus,\u201d he said, pausing for a beat, \u201cI&hellip;I actually liked it.\u201d</p><p>Now it was Cyrus\u2019 turn to be a little surprised, meeting TJ\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>TJ nodded, unable to keep looking at Cyrus, so he opted for looking around the room to try and find something to distract himself. The pride flag on the desk caught his attention, and he picked it up, twirling it around in his hand.</p><p>\u201cI like this,\u201d he said softly, holding it delicately.</p><p>\u201cY-You do?\u201d Cyrus stammered, trying to gauge his reaction.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus took this as a good sign, and, feeling a little bold, said \u201cIt\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>TJ turned to him with a smile so bright that it could eclipse the sun\u2019s rays. \u201cReally? That\u2019s cool. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have the courage to have one in my room.\u201d He breathed out shakily after that; he didn\u2019t really plan on coming out today, to Cyrus, but the moment just felt right.</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 smile softened, opening one of his drawers and rifling around in it. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to make it a big deal, just,\u201d he popped his head up, handing TJ a pin, \u201chere, take it.\u201d</p><p>TJ turned the pin over and over in his hand. It was a rainbow one, with the words \u2018you are loved\u2019 painted on top in black. He smiled, slipping it into his pocket. \u201cThank you, Cyrus. Will I be seeing you around the coffee shop again?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus giggled, throwing his head back; TJ didn\u2019t think he\u2019d heard such a beautiful laugh. \u201cDo the gays flock together?\u201d</p><p>TJ chuckled, standing up. \u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><hr><p>Things seemed to get a lot better after that day. Cyrus started coming in and ordering coffee during TJ\u2019s shifts, and TJ was glad to see that the boy had returned. He\u2019d even started wearing his pride pin on his apron. Sure, he was a little nervous to do so for the first few days, but after a few people had complimented him on it, he was much happier to wear it.</p><p>It\u2019d been about a month of Cyrus coming in, ordering coffee, spending a little too much time talking to TJ, and then working frantically on his schoolwork.</p><p>It was a relatively quiet Wednesday afternoon, the business of the coffee shop had come to a gentle lull. TJ was steaming some milk for an order, when Marty came up beside him, leaning against the counter.</p><p>\u201cSo, how long have you been dating him?\u201d</p><p>TJ nearly spilled the milk on him, pretty much dropping the cup onto the counter, some of the milk sloshing around and spilling on the counter. \u201cWhat?\u201d he squeaked, grabbing a rag, and wiping up his mess.</p><p>Marty rolled his eyes, handing TJ a clean rag. \u201cYou and that kid who keeps coming here?\u201d he pointed to Cyrus, who was making gestures at his computer, since he was studying for his ASL test.</p><p>TJ flushed an embarrassing shade of pink, kicking at the ground below him. \u201cI\u2019m not&hellip;we\u2019re not dating, Marty.\u201d</p><p>Marty groaned, sitting up on the counter. \u201cSure, dude. He just happens to be here whenever your shifts are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s definitely not true,\u201d TJ shot back quietly, sneaking a glance over at Cyrus, who was deep in concentration, \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s here other times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever here when I\u2019m here working without you,\u201d Marty said calmly, shooting TJ a smirk.</p><p>TJ tried to keep his composure on the outside, but on the inside, he was melting. He tried not to read too much into the situation, but he couldn\u2019t help himself. He looked over at Cyrus, who smiled up at him and signed \u2018hi TJ\u2019. It was so cute, he just kind of stared at him until he felt something, or rather someone, slap his arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that for?\u201d TJ scolded, rubbing his arm where it had just been hit.</p><p>\u201cYou were staring,\u201d Marty pointed out.</p><p>\u201cWas not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas too.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, before any more arguing could be done, Buffy walked through the door, smiling brightly at Marty, and taking a seat with Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s Buffy, huh?\u201d TJ crossed his arms, leaning back against the counter.</p><p>Now it was Marty\u2019s turn to be flustered, turning pink. \u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>TJ nudged him. \u201cYou never smile like that.\u201d</p><p>Marty glanced over at Buffy and Cyrus, seeing them deep in conversation, hands moving wildly. Hopping beside TJ, he shook him, effectively spilling ice all over the floor and pointed to Cyrus and Buffy.</p><p>\u201cMarty, I love you, but if you don\u2019t fucking stop shaking me I will pour hot coffee into your sneakers,\u201d TJ threatened, bending down to pick up the ice, Marty helping him a little.</p><p>TJ stood up, letting Marty pick up the rest of the cubes, and ran a hand through his hair. Some of it flopped over his forehead, since he\u2019d run out of hair gel and hadn\u2019t had a chance to get some more. He grabbed another cup, remaking the iced coffee order.</p><p>Meanwhile, Buffy was sizing him up, as Cyrus sat typing away. \u201cSo <i>this </i>is the boy you keep talking about, huh?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus huffed beside her, grabbing a few of his papers and sifting through them. \u201cOh hush, he\u2019s cute and you know it.\u201d</p><p>Buffy shrugged, leaning back in the booth seat. \u201cI <i>guess </i>I can see why you like him,\u201d she agreed, scrolling through her phone for a while, Cyrus doing work next to her.</p><p>After a little while, TJ came up to where he was sitting, and cleared his throat, setting down a coffee cup.</p><p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t order anything,\u201d Cyrus said, nudging the cup away, but TJ held it firmly on the table.</p><p>\u201cI know. This one\u2019s on me. I thought you could use a break from all that strong coffee you drink,\u201d he laughed a little, pushing his hair back. Buffy glanced over at Cyrus, who was blushing at the gesture.</p><p>Cyrus eyed the drink with suspicion. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>TJ smirked a little, leaning against the table. \u201cMy special drink. It\u2019s a secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I know you\u2019re not trying to poison me?\u201d</p><p>TJ\u2019s eyes widened a little. \u201cCyrus, really? You think I would poison my favorite person?\u201d</p><p>Buffy choked on her spit at that, getting both boys to look at her, but she waved them off, going back to her phone.</p><p>Cyrus was now insanely flustered, and couldn\u2019t function as well as he wanted to, so he carefully took the cup into his hands, and took a small sip. It was almost like hot chocolate, but with a hint of vanilla and mint. \u201cThis is&hellip;really, really good.\u201d</p><p>TJ smiled at his work. \u201cI\u2019m glad you like it. I\u2019ll call it the \u2018Cyrus Special\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus laughed a little at that, shaking his head. He went back to his studying, talking to Buffy, and answering her questions about TJ. His drink was gone in record time, and he figured he\u2019d miss it a little.</p><hr><p>When Cyrus came in the next day, however, there was a small chalkboard sign on the counter, which said \u2018try the Cyrus Special: A Minty Vanilla Wonderland\u2019. Still in shock, Cyrus approached the counter, and got TJ\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cYou actually made a drink for me?\u201d he asked, his voice soft and filled with wonder and fondness.</p><p>TJ returned the smile. \u201cI said I would, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to order one then,\u201d he chuckled, handing him the money and placing the change in the tip jar.</p><p>TJ was busy cleaning the counters in the back, so Marty took care of the order. However, when he saw the name written on the cup, he took the liberty of drawing hearts all around the remaining space, and smiling to himself.</p><p>\u201cOne Cyrus Special!\u201d Marty called out, chuckling a little to himself.</p><p>Cyrus closed his laptop and set it on top of the table, putting his phone in his pocket and heading up to the counter. He picked up his drink, but couldn\u2019t help but notice the hearts drawn all over his name. He looked between the cup and Marty, as if to say \u2018what the hell\u2019.</p><p>\u201cYou like him, don\u2019t you?\u201d he asked, giddy with excitement like a child.</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 grip tightened around the drink, swallowing the lump in his throat. \u201cWh-what?\u201d</p><p>Marty sighed, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. \u201cTJ! He likes you a lot!\u201d</p><p>The world seemed to stop spinning right then and there, as TJ walked out from behind the counter and froze. He could feel the blood rushing from his head, and his chest suddenly felt like it was being crushed. Cyrus was looking between Marty and TJ, a look of confusion and worry on his face.</p><p>Marty fumbled with something to say. \u201cOh, uh, I mean, I mean that he talks to you like-like a friend, and he likes that you, uh, when you come in and talk, or, uh-\u201d</p><p>TJ couldn\u2019t take it anymore; he hopped over the counter and ran out the door, making a sharp right and taking off. Cyrus took one sip of his coffee, set it down on the counter, and took off running after TJ. It was harder for him, since he wasn\u2019t athletically gifted, but TJ was important to him, so no matter how badly his legs burned or his lungs ached, he kept running.</p><p>He eventually saw him, sitting under a cherry tree that was almost ready to bloom. His apron was tossed to the side, and as Cyrus got closer, he could see that he was holding the pride pin in his hand.</p><p>Cyrus came up to him, taking a seat on the grass and taking a few moments to gulp down air, trying to catch his breath. \u201cTJ-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-what?\u201d he cut in, sharply. It took Cyrus by surprise, TJ\u2019s tone, but he didn\u2019t linger on that too long.</p><p>\u201cI&hellip;I just wanted to see if you\u2019re okay and-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-I don\u2019t need your pity,\u201d he grumbled, holding the pin tighter in his hand.</p><p>Cyrus shrank into himself, trying to press down the lump in his throat. \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, TJ, I just&hellip;look, about what Marty said, I-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-I don\u2019t need your pity or your help! Can you just back off?\u201d TJ shouted, standing up in a bout of anger, dropping the pin, and stomping on it, effectively breaking it into pieces. It might as well have been Cyrus\u2019 heart that he stepped on; that\u2019s how it felt to Cyrus, at least.</p><p>Cyrus brought a hand up to his mouth, his fingers trembling over his lips. For a split second, TJ looked apologetic, but Cyrus didn\u2019t give himself the time to ponder over his facial expressions He just took off running back to his dorm; he was tired, everything ached, and the hot tears spilling down his cheeks made his vision blurry, but he didn\u2019t stop until he reached his dorm, slamming the door behind him and collapsing on the bed. He couldn\u2019t be thankful enough that his roommate was out.</p><p>Cyrus didn\u2019t know how long he spent, clutching the pillow to his chest and crying into it. At some point, he shakily grabbed the pride flag on top of his desk and shoved it underneath his bed. This was the worst he\u2019d ever felt in his entire life; TJ hadn\u2019t even been in his life for that long, but it felt like he\u2019d just lost the most important person to him. After a while of trying not to cry, followed by crying, he took his phone out of his pocket and texted Buffy.</p><p><b>[Me: can you pick up my stuff from the coffee shop? i left it there and i\u2019m in my dorm]</b></p><p><b>[Buffy: what? why??]</b></p><p><b>[Me: long story, i don\u2019t feel like talking about it right now, please?]</b></p><p><b>[Buffy:&hellip;okay]</b></p><p>He waited in his room, until after around twenty minutes there were footsteps \u00a0near his door, and a soft \u2018thump\u2019 on his door.</p><p>\u201cCyrus? I brought your stuff. I hope you\u2019re okay, text me when you can,\u201d she said, walking off.</p><p>Cyrus waited five minutes before he opened the door and picked up his things. He saw that she\u2019s also brought his coffee, with his name and hearts still on the cup. Taking it in his hand, he took a sip; it was cold now, but it still tasted good. Unfortunately, it still reminded him of TJ, so he ended up throwing it out, before resigning back to his bed for the rest of the day.</p><hr><p>TJ took the next few days off of work; he couldn\u2019t handle being in there for a while, but he couldn\u2019t avoid it for too long; he needed the money.</p><p>When he rolled in on Monday morning, and saw Marty behind the counter, casually wiping it down, he made a beeline to him, narrowing his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou absolute idiot!\u201d he shrieked, yanking on his apron.</p><p>Marty glanced up from the counter, raising a brow. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you \u2018what\u2019 me Marty! You told Cyrus that I liked him!\u201d he whispered harshly, his gaze flitting around the shop, \u201cthat was supposed to be a secret.\u201d</p><p>Marty groaned, turning on the machines. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a secret that you two are flirting.\u201d</p><p>TJ\u2019s eyes widened, crossing his arms. \u201cWhat does <i>that </i>mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you not see the way he looks at you or talks to you? I\u2019m like almost a hundred percent sure that he likes you,\u201d he told him.</p><p>TJ sighed sadly, washing a cup. \u201cWell now there\u2019s no chance of that happening.\u201d</p><p>Marty didn\u2019t look up. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>TJ hesitated, fidgeting with the loose ends of his apron ties. \u201cI kind of snapped at him after what happened that day and we haven\u2019t spoken since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to work things out with him, dude. You know that right?\u201d</p><p>TJ nodded. \u201cYeah, I know. I just have no idea what to do.\u201d</p><p>Marty grabbed the milk out of the fridge, and started to make himself a coffee, dropping a few bills into the tip jar. \u201cI have some idea.\u201d</p><hr><p>The following day, early in the afternoon, TJ climbed the stairs to Cyrus\u2019 dorm, his nerves increasing with each shaky step. Considering how close the two boys had been, TJ knew Cyrus\u2019 schedule with relative confidence. He stood outside of Cyrus\u2019 door for a full minute and a half before he knocked, so quietly that he wondered if Cyrus even heard it. After a beat, he heard footsteps from inside, and Cyrus opened the door.</p><p>The first emotion that came over TJ was guilt; Cyrus looked miserable, his hair all over the place, and it looked like he had been wearing the same clothes. He felt upset, mad at himself, but most of all he felt like a terrible human being because Cyrus started to shut the door. Thinking quickly, TJ shoved his foot in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Cyrus, can I talk to you?\u201d he pleaded; it sounded almost like a whimper.</p><p>Cyrus just blinked in response, not changing his facial expression or body positioning. TJ had really hurt him; he knew that he tended to forgive fairly easily, but he tried to force himself not to, at least in this instance.</p><p>TJ reached into his pocket, pulling out a new pride pin, and fumbling with it for a moment, before he attached it onto his shirt successfully. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about what I said and what I did. I was just&hellip;so freaked out by what Marty said&hellip;\u201d</p><p>Cyrus leaned against the doorframe. \u201cSo you decided to snap at me?\u201d</p><p>TJ ran a hand through his hair; Cyrus tried his best to not think about how cute he looked. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I got scared because&hellip;because he\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus raised a brow, his cold demeanor now replaced with a confused one.</p><p>\u201cI like you, Cyrus, okay? Marty saying that&hellip;it scared me, I was worried it would ruin things between us,\u201d he said, his voice getting softer as he spoke.</p><p>Cyrus didn\u2019t say anything, he just ushered TJ inside, shutting the door behind him. He took a seat on the bed, patting the spot beside him for TJ to come and sit down. TJ nervously sat, wringing his hands in his lap.</p><p>\u201cI want you to know that something like this wouldn\u2019t change things for the worse between us, okay?\u201d</p><p>TJ nodded in response, but he kept his gaze down, not willing himself to look at Cyrus. He didn\u2019t want to start crying, not now. Noticing his distress, Cyrus placed a hand on top of TJ\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cBut&hellip;I\u2019m really glad you said something because I like you too, you know?\u201d</p><p>TJ felt the tips of his ears burn at that, and he looked up at Cyrus, a hopeful smile on his face. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus giggled, nodding. \u201cYes, really!\u201d</p><p>TJ felt his whole body relax, and he leaned back on the bed, staring up at the ceiling. \u201cSo&hellip;would you maybe want to go on a date with me?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus counted to three in his head before he tackled TJ with a hug. \u201cYes, you dork, I would <i>love </i>to go on a date with you!\u201d</p><p>They stayed like that for a little bit, before they sat up, hands intertwined. Cyrus reached down and pulled out the pride flag from underneath his bed, waving it around. TJ grinned, holding it with him.</p><hr><p>Exactly two days and eight hours later, TJ and Cyrus walked into the coffee shop, hand in hand, both excited and thoroughly nervous for their first date. Cyrus ended up ordering the \u2018Cyrus Special\u2019, while TJ was too excited to order anything.</p><p>They talked quietly until their server brought the order, winking, and making TJ blush like mad. He glanced over to Cyrus, a fond smile on his face. \u201cYou look unbearably adorable right now.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus grinned, letting a soft laugh escape his through his lips. \u201cDon\u2019t make me blush like this,\u201d he practically whined.</p><p>TJ leaned in a little closer, knocking their knees together. \u201cLike what, hmm?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 smile turned into a small smirk, his eyes glimmering. \u201cBet you can\u2019t get closer to me?\u201d</p><p>TJ laughed softly, before leaning forward and kissing him. Cyrus tastes like vanilla and mint, and it\u2019s everything he\u2019s ever wanted. No other kiss could compare to this one.</p><p>When they pull away, TJ\u2019s eyes stay closed for a little while before fluttering open, and landing on Cyrus, who was nearly on the verge of tears.</p><p>\u201cWait, did I do something wrong?\u201d TJ worried, placing his hand on top of Cyrus\u2019, but then removing it.</p><p>Cyrus shakes his head, choking out a watery laugh. \u201cNo, no, I\u2019m just&hellip;so insanely happy,\u201d he admitted, after which TJ pulled him close, wrapping his arms around Cyrus and enjoying the moment. He could confidently say this was the best first date ever.</p><hr><p>The following Monday, Cyrus came in and greeted TJ with a kiss on the cheek, to which Marty reacted as if TJ had just sprouted a second head.</p><p>\u201cSo&hellip;\u201d Marty trailed.</p><p>TJ chuckled, shrugging. \u201cYes, dumbass, we\u2019re dating.\u201d</p><p>Marty broke out into a grin, shoving TJ a little and slapping his arm over and over. \u201cDude, finally! Who confessed first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>Marty\u2019s face dropped at that, and Buffy popped out of seemingly nowhere (it wasn\u2019t nowhere, it was actually from behind the counter).</p><p>\u201cHa! I told you! You owe me the drink of my choice,\u201d she stated victoriously.</p><p>\u201cYou <i>bet </i>on us?\u201d TJ asked incredulously.</p><p>Buffy chuckled, nodding. \u201cAt least you guys got your heads out of your asses and confessed to each other.\u201d</p><p>TJ looked over at Cyrus, who was sitting and working on his laptop, with a fond smile. \u201cYeah. At least that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019ll it be?\u201d Marty asked, grabbing a cup and a pen.</p><p>\u201cHmm, I think I want my own drink,\u201d she decided, \u201cthe \u2018Buffy Blitz\u2019, if you will. A latte with two pumps of caramel, and three of white chocolate, topped with whipped cream and shaved chocolate.\u201d</p><p>Marty scribbled away on the cup. \u201cComing right up, your highness.\u201d</p><p>After he finished the order, they decided to close up a little early, and all four of them sat together at a table for a double date. It was one of their favorite experiences to date.</p><hr><p>When TJ graduated from college, he ended up becoming the school psychologist for Jefferson Middle School and he opened a coffee shop on the side, which he and his sister Amber co-owned.</p><p>Cyrus went on to study during his graduate years, and would always come by to grab his coffee, which TJ would always have a coffee ready for him. He would still wear the pride pin that he had kept all these years, and there was even a small pride flag around the tip jar.</p><p>The menu was made up of the classic drinks, but there were also specialty drinks, which were all named after his friends. Cyrus sometimes got a different order, but the one that TJ named after him would forever be his favorite.</p><p>One day, after TJ\u2019s shift, he and Cyrus took the long way back to Cyrus\u2019 apartment, taking in the beautiful buds that were soon going to bloom into flowers, and admiring the way the sun fell through the leaves. Even if it was the long way back, it still felt too short, too soon to part, at least to TJ. Cyrus seemed to pick up on this, giving him a soft smile and taking his hand in his own.</p><p>\u201cCome in, stay for a little while,\u201d Cyrus offered.</p><p>TJ shrugged, kicking at the ground. \u201cNo, that\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll have to leave anyways.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus waited a beat, taking a small step towards TJ. \u201cI mean, you could always move in with me.\u201d</p><p>TJ looked up at him so fast he swore he heard his neck snap. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus giggled, tugging him inside. \u201cLook, I know it\u2019s kind of small and cramped but&hellip;we could make it work. What do you say?\u201d</p><p>TJ could barely believe what he was hearing. He stared for a few moments, before wrapping his arms around Cyrus and spinning him around. \u201cYes, oh my gosh, I\u2019d love to!\u201d</p><p>Peals of laughter filled the room, the two boys happier than ever before.</p><p>TJ put him down, his smile softening. \u201cYou know, I told myself I wouldn\u2019t move in with someone unless I was getting married.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus raised his brows, smirking. \u201cWell, well, well. Might just have to propose one of these days then, huh?\u201d</p><p>TJ laughed a little, pressing a kiss to Cyrus\u2019 temple and wrapping an arm around him. \u201cOkay, sure, whatever you say, Cy.\u201d</p><hr><p>Two months later, when they were both sitting under the covers, watching a movie, Cyrus turned to TJ and said, \u201cWe should get married.\u201d</p><p>TJ just looked at him, pausing the movie. \u201cCyrus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, only if you want to, you know,\u201d Cyrus shrugged, looking up into his eyes, \u201cbut&hellip;if you do, that\u2019d be cool.\u201d</p><p>That night, Cyrus saw what was quite possibly the most beautiful smile on TJ\u2019s face. \u201cThere\u2019s no one else I\u2019d rather be with,\u201d he smiled, leaning in for a kiss. Cyrus seemed to always taste like vanilla and mint, and if that\u2019s what it would be like for the rest of their lives, that was just okay with him.</p><p>Cyrus pulled back from the kiss, his eyes still closed, and leaned on TJ\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI love you, TJ.\u201d</p><p>TJ smiled at the boy in his arms. He remembered when they had barely just met; TJ had no idea how important Cyrus would become to him. He couldn\u2019t imagine his life without the brunet.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Cy.\u201d</p>",

You say this every semester, Cy, and you always make it through. This week\u2019s gonna be rough, but I promise that you\u2019ll do fine.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus sighed, rolling onto his back and staring at the ceiling. \u201cI\u2019ve never had to write a paper this long before, and I just kept putting it off, and now I only have a week? On top of studying for midterms? I\u2019m going to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust\u2026go and grab a coffee or something, to, you know, keep you going,\u201d she suggested, and he perked up at that.</p><p>\u201cCome with me?\u201d Cyrus asked, almost pleadingly.</p><p>Buffy hesitated. \u201cI would but\u2026I kind of already promised someone that I would hang out with them today after classes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have midterms too?\u201d</p><p>Buffy smiled proudly, crossing her arms. \u201cPerks of playing a sport at the collegiate level is that I get to take midterms early. \u2018Cause of the game schedule. It actually works out quite nicely.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus sighed, leaning back against the back of his bed. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make me go and interact with the barista and order a coffee? You know I\u2019m just going to stumble on my own words.\u201d</p><p>She placed a comforting hand on his shoulder, as if to try and reassure him. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be fine. You\u2019ve done it before. Plus, what\u2019s the worst that could happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see a cute boy and short circuit, forget my name, he thinks I have amnesia and he takes me to a hospital where they find out that I have-\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he caught his breath, pinching the bridge of his nose, \u201cdream I had.

We\u2019re just friends, and he invited me to go bowling.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smirked, crossing his arms. \u201cAnd are you going with a group of friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no,\u201d she answered, shaking her head, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus waved her off, ushering her out of his room. \u201cYeah, yeah, it\u2019s a date, even if you won\u2019t admit it. Tell me about it afterwards. Also wear a blue shirt, it brings out your eyes.\u201d</p><p>He closed the door before she could say anything else, and started to pack his backpack full of things he would need to work. Normally, he would work in the library, but during midterms week, he always found it either too quiet or too loud. The coffee shop seemed to have the perfect blend of quiet chatter in the background in order to keep him focused on his work, and not allow him to listen to his thoughts. It was a good environment to work in. Probably one of his favorites. He knew he couldn\u2019t stay away no matter if he was alone or with a friend.</p><p>And that\u2019s how Cyrus found himself rushing to coffee shop during the rain, papers in hand, sliding through the door and plopping himself down in his usual seat; a booth near one of the windows. He started setting up his computer, plugging it into the outlet, and turning it on. Pulling out a folder of his, he shuffled through piles of paper to find the one with the assignment. That\u2019s when he decided to go up and order, running a hand through his hair.</p><p>TJ saw the boy approaching, and swore that for a split second, he lost his breath. With his soft brown hair sweeping across his forehead, slightly upturned nose, and rosy complexion, he was, in short, beautiful.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>TJ snapped out of his reverie at the boy\u2019s words. He looked down at him, slightly flushed. \u201cSorry, what can I get for you?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus sighed, squinting up at the menu and then just bowing his head slightly. \u201cCan I just get five espressos, but all in one cup?\u201d</p><p>If TJ were holding a cup in his hand, he would have dropped it. Picking one up from the stack, he started to write on it. \u201cThat\u2019s bound to kill you.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus shrugged with one shoulder, smiling a little bit. \u201cIt\u2019s either that or exams, so I\u2019d rather it be coffee that gives me the sweet release of death.\u201d</p><p>TJ laughed out loud at that, smiling far too widely given what Cyrus said. It wasn\u2019t particularly hilarious, but it sure seemed that way to TJ. Maybe it was just because the boy in front of him was exceptionally cute.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you, going to med school or something?\u201d TJ wondered aloud, scooping some of the coffee grounds into a container.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m a double major,\u201d he replied, leaning against the counter.</p><p>TJ nodded. \u201cAh, the silent killer.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus laughed so hard at that he snorted, immediately flushing a deep shade of red. Oh, Buffy was going to get an earful of this later.</p><p>Meanwhile TJ was trying to keep his composure and not spill the coffee grounds all over the place. Turning on the machine, it started to hum and drip the espresso into a cup. He had to continuously add more grounds to make it to five shots, but he eventually got there. Capping the cup, he slid it over to Cyrus, before noticing the pile of stuff, which he assumed was his, in the corner of the shop.</p><p>\u201cOh shoot, I assumed this was to go, sorry,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>Cyrus waved him off, sliding him the money for the coffee. \u201cThat\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll stay here, keep you company, seeing as there are almost no people here,\u201d he laughed a little.</p><p>TJ ignored him for the moment, focusing intensely on getting the amount of change right, and handing it to the other boy. \u201cDon\u2019t you have studying to do\u2026I would use your full name, but I don\u2019t even know your first name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Cyrus squinted at his nametag, \u201cTJ, studying can wait. I\u2019m Cyrus, by the way.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus. What a beautiful name to match a beautiful person. \u201cWell, that\u2019s cool then. Maybe I\u2019ll just take my break now,\u201d he decided, walking out from behind the counter.</p><p>During the time that they talked, Cyrus learned that TJ was here on a basketball scholarship, but that he was majoring in psychology, with the intent of becoming a school counselor, and a minor in gender studies.</p><p>\u201cWhat made you wanna minor in that?\u201d Cyrus asked, sipping his all too bitter coffee, and making a face about it.</p><p>TJ smiled shyly, sliding him a couple of sugar packets. \u201cOh, uh, I guess it just sounded cool, or something,\u201d he mumbled, trying to brush it off.</p><p>Cyrus made a mental note to himself that TJ looked cute when he was slightly flustered. \u201cThat\u2019s cool. Sounds really interesting.\u201d</p><p>TJ learned that Cyrus was double majoring in film and journalism, with the intent of either becoming a playwright or a writer. He still didn\u2019t know which one he wanted to pursue; as he sipped his coffee, he seemed to talk faster and faster, which increasingly worried TJ.</p><p>\u201cHang out here for a while, alright?\u201d TJ told him, getting up from his seat, \u201cI\u2019ll walk you back after I finish my shift.\u201d</p><p>Small groups of people filtered in during the rest of TJ\u2019s shift, and he kept an eye on Cyrus all the while, who was typing away on his computer like a mad man. He couldn\u2019t help but smile at that as he made the seemingly endless streams of chai lattes.</p><hr><p>TJ finished up his shift on a good note, and he even had time to clean some of the equipment at the end of his shift, before he hung up his apron in the back room and walked out to where Cyrus was sitting, his leg bouncing uncontrollably. </p><p>\u201cAlright, time to head out,\u201d TJ said, to which Cyrus pouted and shut his laptop, shoving it in his bag.</p><p>\u201cI was so close to finishing my last paper, though!\u201d he whined, getting up and nearly hopping towards the door.</p><p>TJ chuckled, falling in step with him. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll get to finish it once you get back to your dorm\u2026which I\u2019m just now realizing I don\u2019t know where it is. Care to lead the way?\u201d</p><p>And lead the way he did. Cyrus had never felt more energetic in his life; was this how athletic people felt? It was incredible. He even went up the stairs without feeling completely winded at the top. All the while, TJ was admiring him with a fond smile on his face. He had just met Cyrus this afternoon, but he felt like he\u2019d known him his entire life.</p><p>Once they reached Cyrus\u2019 dorm, his frantic energy seemed to calm down a little, as he opened the door and stood in the threshold, turning to face TJ.</p><p>\u201cThanks for walking me back,\u201d he said, and he was a bit more calm than he\u2019d been previously, \u201cyou didn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>TJ shrugged, putting his hands in his pockets, looking around the room. He saw a small pride flag on one of the tables, but he tried to tell himself it was probably Cyrus\u2019 roommate\u2019s. \u201cBut I <i>wanted </i>to.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to, and Cyrus thought it was so sweet of him. He\u2019d only known TJ for the time that they\u2019d spent at the coffee shop, but he already felt so close to him, like they were best friends. Without thinking, he stepped forward and wrapped his arms around TJ in a hug.</p><p>TJ didn\u2019t really respond for a second; a hug was the last thing he was expecting, and yet, here he was. It was really nice, actually, but by the time TJ had actually started to put his arms around Cyrus, the boy pulled back, mortified, and shut the door.</p><p>TJ waited outside Cyrus\u2019 door for a minute, waiting to see if maybe he\u2019d open it again and talk to him. But after a little while, he left, shaking his head.</p><hr><p>For the next few days, Cyrus avoided the coffee shop like the plague. Buffy came in to get his orders, and by the time she delivered it to him, it was cold because she\u2019d been talking to Marty about their next date.</p><p><i>\u201cYou guys are going out on a date?\u201d Cyrus had exclaimed, his eyes bugging out of his head.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal,\u201d she brushed it off, grabbing a piece of her hair and twirling it around between her fingers.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus took a sip of his coffee, smirking. \u201cOh, please, you\u2019re so smitten with him and you\u2019re excited that he asked you out.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYour words, not mine.\u201d</i></p><p>TJ\u2019s head snapped up every time the bell rang above the door, but he never saw Cyrus enter. He sighed, pouring the milk into the cup before Marty came up by him and snatched it out of his hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d TJ snapped, crossing his arms.</p><p>\u201cThe order is for soy milk, not two percent! Are you trying to actively kill our customers?\u201d Marty carded his fingers through his hair, exasperated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bad with numbers,\u201d TJ mumbled, grabbing a new cup.</p><p>Marty shook his head, taking the cup from TJ\u2019s hands. \u201cYou\u2019re not like this even when you pull an allnighter. What\u2019s going on, dude?\u201d</p><p>TJ sighed, leaning back against the counter. He started to explain everything, from the moment that Cyrus walked in, to when they walked back to his dorm together, to when Cyrus hugged him and them pulled away immediately.</p><p>\u201cThat pretty much brings us up to date,\u201d he said plainly, grabbing a rag and wiping down the counter, while Marty stared at him with wide eyes.</p><p>\u201cJust talk to him, dude,\u201d he told him, nudging him a little, \u201cI\u2019m sure things are still fine between you two.\u201d</p><p>TJ just shrugged, and continued on with his shift like a robot, going through the movements with little effort. The end of his shift came pretty quickly, and he ended up spending some time at the courts shooting hoops, until his phone buzzed.</p><p><b>[Marty: go talk to him or so help me]</b></p><hr><p>Somehow, TJ found himself going up the stairs in Cyrus\u2019 dorm complex, and towards his room. He stood outside the door for a little bit, trying to collect his thoughts and think of something to say that would make sense. Tentatively, he rapped his knuckles on the door and waited.</p><p>Soft footsteps were heard from inside, and Cyrus opened the door. All of TJ\u2019s planning to say something comprehensible went out the window when he saw him; Cyrus was wearing clothes that were way too big for him, and he had glasses on this time.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi,\u201d Cyrus said quietly, snapping TJ out of his thoughts.</p><p>\u201c\u2026hey,\u201d he mumbled, clearing his throat, \u201ccan I talk to you for a second? If you have a class that\u2019s fine, I can come back later, or-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-I have time right now,\u201d Cyrus cut in, stepping aside and letting TJ in. He shut the door, his head pounding in his chest, and turned around to see TJ sitting on the ground. Cyrus found that amusing and a little bit cute, but he tried to quell that voice in his head. He took a seat by TJ, pulling his knees into his chest.</p><p>\u201cDid I\u2026do something wrong?\u201d TJ asked quietly, looking down at the ground.</p><p>Cyrus immediately turned to look at him, a worried look etched into his face. \u201cWhat? No! What would make you say that?\u201d</p><p>TJ shrugged, picking at a fray string in the rug. \u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know, I guess since I haven\u2019t seen you much around the coffee shop that\u2026I did something wrong.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus drew in a breath, gnawing on his lower lip. \u201cRight,\u201d he mumbled, \u201cbut\u2026you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I did.\u201d</p><p>TJ looked up from the ground for the first time, unable to meet Cyrus\u2019 gaze since the other boy was looking up at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus closed his eyes. \u201cAfter you walked me back to my dorm and I just\u2026hugged you, I wasn\u2019t thinking straight\u2026sorry.\u201d</p><p>TJ nearly chuckled at \u2018not thinking straight\u2019, but kept a solemn face. \u201cYou think I\u2019m, like, mad at you for that?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus shrugged, opening his eyes and looking at TJ. \u201cI\u2026guess not mad, but weirded out because I\u2019m-\u201d</p><p>He stopped, not letting any more words flow out of his mouth. He surprised himself in that moment; he almost came out to TJ without so much as a second thought to how he might react.</p><p>TJ seemed to pick up on Cyrus\u2019 discomfort, and shifted a little. \u201cI\u2019m not weirded out, Cyrus,\u201d he said, pausing for a beat, \u201cI\u2026I actually liked it.\u201d</p><p>Now it was Cyrus\u2019 turn to be a little surprised, meeting TJ\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>TJ nodded, unable to keep looking at Cyrus, so he opted for looking around the room to try and find something to distract himself. The pride flag on the desk caught his attention, and he picked it up, twirling it around in his hand.</p><p>\u201cI like this,\u201d he said softly, holding it delicately.</p><p>\u201cY-You do?\u201d Cyrus stammered, trying to gauge his reaction.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus took this as a good sign, and, feeling a little bold, said \u201cIt\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>TJ turned to him with a smile so bright that it could eclipse the sun\u2019s rays. \u201cReally? That\u2019s cool. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have the courage to have one in my room.\u201d He breathed out shakily after that; he didn\u2019t really plan on coming out today, to Cyrus, but the moment just felt right.</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 smile softened, opening one of his drawers and rifling around in it. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to make it a big deal, just,\u201d he popped his head up, handing TJ a pin, \u201chere, take it.\u201d</p><p>TJ turned the pin over and over in his hand. It was a rainbow one, with the words \u2018you are loved\u2019 painted on top in black. He smiled, slipping it into his pocket. \u201cThank you, Cyrus. Will I be seeing you around the coffee shop again?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus giggled, throwing his head back; TJ didn\u2019t think he\u2019d heard such a beautiful laugh. \u201cDo the gays flock together?\u201d</p><p>TJ chuckled, standing up. \u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><hr><p>Things seemed to get a lot better after that day. Cyrus started coming in and ordering coffee during TJ\u2019s shifts, and TJ was glad to see that the boy had returned. He\u2019d even started wearing his pride pin on his apron. Sure, he was a little nervous to do so for the first few days, but after a few people had complimented him on it, he was much happier to wear it.</p><p>It\u2019d been about a month of Cyrus coming in, ordering coffee, spending a little too much time talking to TJ, and then working frantically on his schoolwork.</p><p>It was a relatively quiet Wednesday afternoon, the business of the coffee shop had come to a gentle lull. TJ was steaming some milk for an order, when Marty came up beside him, leaning against the counter.</p><p>\u201cSo, how long have you been dating him?\u201d</p><p>TJ nearly spilled the milk on him, pretty much dropping the cup onto the counter, some of the milk sloshing around and spilling on the counter. \u201cWhat?\u201d he squeaked, grabbing a rag, and wiping up his mess.</p><p>Marty rolled his eyes, handing TJ a clean rag. \u201cYou and that kid who keeps coming here?\u201d he pointed to Cyrus, who was making gestures at his computer, since he was studying for his ASL test.</p><p>TJ flushed an embarrassing shade of pink, kicking at the ground below him. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2026we\u2019re not dating, Marty.\u201d</p><p>Marty groaned, sitting up on the counter. \u201cSure, dude. He just happens to be here whenever your shifts are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s definitely not true,\u201d TJ shot back quietly, sneaking a glance over at Cyrus, who was deep in concentration, \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s here other times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever here when I\u2019m here working without you,\u201d Marty said calmly, shooting TJ a smirk.</p><p>TJ tried to keep his composure on the outside, but on the inside, he was melting. He tried not to read too much into the situation, but he couldn\u2019t help himself. He looked over at Cyrus, who smiled up at him and signed \u2018hi TJ\u2019. It was so cute, he just kind of stared at him until he felt something, or rather someone, slap his arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that for?\u201d TJ scolded, rubbing his arm where it had just been hit.</p><p>\u201cYou were staring,\u201d Marty pointed out.</p><p>\u201cWas not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas too.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, before any more arguing could be done, Buffy walked through the door, smiling brightly at Marty, and taking a seat with Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s Buffy, huh?\u201d TJ crossed his arms, leaning back against the counter.</p><p>Now it was Marty\u2019s turn to be flustered, turning pink. \u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>TJ nudged him. \u201cYou never smile like that.\u201d</p><p>Marty glanced over at Buffy and Cyrus, seeing them deep in conversation, hands moving wildly. Hopping beside TJ, he shook him, effectively spilling ice all over the floor and pointed to Cyrus and Buffy.</p><p>\u201cMarty, I love you, but if you don\u2019t fucking stop shaking me I will pour hot coffee into your sneakers,\u201d TJ threatened, bending down to pick up the ice, Marty helping him a little.</p><p>TJ stood up, letting Marty pick up the rest of the cubes, and ran a hand through his hair. Some of it flopped over his forehead, since he\u2019d run out of hair gel and hadn\u2019t had a chance to get some more. He grabbed another cup, remaking the iced coffee order.</p><p>Meanwhile, Buffy was sizing him up, as Cyrus sat typing away. \u201cSo <i>this </i>is the boy you keep talking about, huh?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus huffed beside her, grabbing a few of his papers and sifting through them. \u201cOh hush, he\u2019s cute and you know it.\u201d</p><p>Buffy shrugged, leaning back in the booth seat. \u201cI <i>guess </i>I can see why you like him,\u201d she agreed, scrolling through her phone for a while, Cyrus doing work next to her.</p><p>After a little while, TJ came up to where he was sitting, and cleared his throat, setting down a coffee cup.</p><p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t order anything,\u201d Cyrus said, nudging the cup away, but TJ held it firmly on the table.</p><p>\u201cI know. This one\u2019s on me. I thought you could use a break from all that strong coffee you drink,\u201d he laughed a little, pushing his hair back. Buffy glanced over at Cyrus, who was blushing at the gesture.</p><p>Cyrus eyed the drink with suspicion. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>TJ smirked a little, leaning against the table. \u201cMy special drink. It\u2019s a secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I know you\u2019re not trying to poison me?\u201d</p><p>TJ\u2019s eyes widened a little. \u201cCyrus, really? You think I would poison my favorite person?\u201d</p><p>Buffy choked on her spit at that, getting both boys to look at her, but she waved them off, going back to her phone.</p><p>Cyrus was now insanely flustered, and couldn\u2019t function as well as he wanted to, so he carefully took the cup into his hands, and took a small sip. It was almost like hot chocolate, but with a hint of vanilla and mint. \u201cThis is\u2026really, really good.\u201d</p><p>TJ smiled at his work. \u201cI\u2019m glad you like it. I\u2019ll call it the \u2018Cyrus Special\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus laughed a little at that, shaking his head. He went back to his studying, talking to Buffy, and answering her questions about TJ. His drink was gone in record time, and he figured he\u2019d miss it a little.</p><hr><p>When Cyrus came in the next day, however, there was a small chalkboard sign on the counter, which said \u2018try the Cyrus Special: A Minty Vanilla Wonderland\u2019. Still in shock, Cyrus approached the counter, and got TJ\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cYou actually made a drink for me?\u201d he asked, his voice soft and filled with wonder and fondness.</p><p>TJ returned the smile. \u201cI said I would, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to order one then,\u201d he chuckled, handing him the money and placing the change in the tip jar.</p><p>TJ was busy cleaning the counters in the back, so Marty took care of the order. However, when he saw the name written on the cup, he took the liberty of drawing hearts all around the remaining space, and smiling to himself.</p><p>\u201cOne Cyrus Special!\u201d Marty called out, chuckling a little to himself.</p><p>Cyrus closed his laptop and set it on top of the table, putting his phone in his pocket and heading up to the counter. He picked up his drink, but couldn\u2019t help but notice the hearts drawn all over his name. He looked between the cup and Marty, as if to say \u2018what the hell\u2019.</p><p>\u201cYou like him, don\u2019t you?\u201d he asked, giddy with excitement like a child.</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 grip tightened around the drink, swallowing the lump in his throat. \u201cWh-what?\u201d</p><p>Marty sighed, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. \u201cTJ! He likes you a lot!\u201d</p><p>The world seemed to stop spinning right then and there, as TJ walked out from behind the counter and froze. He could feel the blood rushing from his head, and his chest suddenly felt like it was being crushed. Cyrus was looking between Marty and TJ, a look of confusion and worry on his face.</p><p>Marty fumbled with something to say. \u201cOh, uh, I mean, I mean that he talks to you like-like a friend, and he likes that you, uh, when you come in and talk, or, uh-\u201d</p><p>TJ couldn\u2019t take it anymore; he hopped over the counter and ran out the door, making a sharp right and taking off. Cyrus took one sip of his coffee, set it down on the counter, and took off running after TJ. It was harder for him, since he wasn\u2019t athletically gifted, but TJ was important to him, so no matter how badly his legs burned or his lungs ached, he kept running.</p><p>He eventually saw him, sitting under a cherry tree that was almost ready to bloom. His apron was tossed to the side, and as Cyrus got closer, he could see that he was holding the pride pin in his hand.</p><p>Cyrus came up to him, taking a seat on the grass and taking a few moments to gulp down air, trying to catch his breath. \u201cTJ-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-what?\u201d he cut in, sharply. It took Cyrus by surprise, TJ\u2019s tone, but he didn\u2019t linger on that too long.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026I just wanted to see if you\u2019re okay and-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-I don\u2019t need your pity,\u201d he grumbled, holding the pin tighter in his hand.</p><p>Cyrus shrank into himself, trying to press down the lump in his throat. \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, TJ, I just\u2026look, about what Marty said, I-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-I don\u2019t need your pity or your help! Can you just back off?\u201d TJ shouted, standing up in a bout of anger, dropping the pin, and stomping on it, effectively breaking it into pieces. It might as well have been Cyrus\u2019 heart that he stepped on; that\u2019s how it felt to Cyrus, at least.</p><p>Cyrus brought a hand up to his mouth, his fingers trembling over his lips. For a split second, TJ looked apologetic, but Cyrus didn\u2019t give himself the time to ponder over his facial expressions He just took off running back to his dorm; he was tired, everything ached, and the hot tears spilling down his cheeks made his vision blurry, but he didn\u2019t stop until he reached his dorm, slamming the door behind him and collapsing on the bed. He couldn\u2019t be thankful enough that his roommate was out.</p><p>Cyrus didn\u2019t know how long he spent, clutching the pillow to his chest and crying into it. At some point, he shakily grabbed the pride flag on top of his desk and shoved it underneath his bed. This was the worst he\u2019d ever felt in his entire life; TJ hadn\u2019t even been in his life for that long, but it felt like he\u2019d just lost the most important person to him. After a while of trying not to cry, followed by crying, he took his phone out of his pocket and texted Buffy.</p><p><b>[Me: can you pick up my stuff from the coffee shop? i left it there and i\u2019m in my dorm]</b></p><p><b>[Buffy: what? why??]</b></p><p><b>[Me: long story, i don\u2019t feel like talking about it right now, please?]</b></p><p><b>[Buffy:\u2026okay]</b></p><p>He waited in his room, until after around twenty minutes there were footsteps \u00a0near his door, and a soft \u2018thump\u2019 on his door.</p><p>\u201cCyrus? I brought your stuff. I hope you\u2019re okay, text me when you can,\u201d she said, walking off.</p><p>Cyrus waited five minutes before he opened the door and picked up his things. He saw that she\u2019s also brought his coffee, with his name and hearts still on the cup. Taking it in his hand, he took a sip; it was cold now, but it still tasted good. Unfortunately, it still reminded him of TJ, so he ended up throwing it out, before resigning back to his bed for the rest of the day.</p><hr><p>TJ took the next few days off of work; he couldn\u2019t handle being in there for a while, but he couldn\u2019t avoid it for too long; he needed the money.</p><p>When he rolled in on Monday morning, and saw Marty behind the counter, casually wiping it down, he made a beeline to him, narrowing his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou absolute idiot!\u201d he shrieked, yanking on his apron.</p><p>Marty glanced up from the counter, raising a brow. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you \u2018what\u2019 me Marty! You told Cyrus that I liked him!\u201d he whispered harshly, his gaze flitting around the shop, \u201cthat was supposed to be a secret.\u201d</p><p>Marty groaned, turning on the machines. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a secret that you two are flirting.\u201d</p><p>TJ\u2019s eyes widened, crossing his arms. \u201cWhat does <i>that </i>mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you not see the way he looks at you or talks to you? I\u2019m like almost a hundred percent sure that he likes you,\u201d he told him.</p><p>TJ sighed sadly, washing a cup. \u201cWell now there\u2019s no chance of that happening.\u201d</p><p>Marty didn\u2019t look up. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>TJ hesitated, fidgeting with the loose ends of his apron ties. \u201cI kind of snapped at him after what happened that day and we haven\u2019t spoken since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to work things out with him, dude. You know that right?\u201d</p><p>TJ nodded. \u201cYeah, I know. I just have no idea what to do.\u201d</p><p>Marty grabbed the milk out of the fridge, and started to make himself a coffee, dropping a few bills into the tip jar. \u201cI have some idea.\u201d</p><hr><p>The following day, early in the afternoon, TJ climbed the stairs to Cyrus\u2019 dorm, his nerves increasing with each shaky step. Considering how close the two boys had been, TJ knew Cyrus\u2019 schedule with relative confidence. He stood outside of Cyrus\u2019 door for a full minute and a half before he knocked, so quietly that he wondered if Cyrus even heard it. After a beat, he heard footsteps from inside, and Cyrus opened the door.</p><p>The first emotion that came over TJ was guilt; Cyrus looked miserable, his hair all over the place, and it looked like he had been wearing the same clothes. He felt upset, mad at himself, but most of all he felt like a terrible human being because Cyrus started to shut the door. Thinking quickly, TJ shoved his foot in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Cyrus, can I talk to you?\u201d he pleaded; it sounded almost like a whimper.</p><p>Cyrus just blinked in response, not changing his facial expression or body positioning. TJ had really hurt him; he knew that he tended to forgive fairly easily, but he tried to force himself not to, at least in this instance.</p><p>TJ reached into his pocket, pulling out a new pride pin, and fumbling with it for a moment, before he attached it onto his shirt successfully. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about what I said and what I did. I was just\u2026so freaked out by what Marty said\u2026\u201d</p><p>Cyrus leaned against the doorframe. \u201cSo you decided to snap at me?\u201d</p><p>TJ ran a hand through his hair; Cyrus tried his best to not think about how cute he looked. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I got scared because\u2026because he\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus raised a brow, his cold demeanor now replaced with a confused one.</p><p>\u201cI like you, Cyrus, okay? Marty saying that\u2026it scared me, I was worried it would ruin things between us,\u201d he said, his voice getting softer as he spoke.</p><p>Cyrus didn\u2019t say anything, he just ushered TJ inside, shutting the door behind him. He took a seat on the bed, patting the spot beside him for TJ to come and sit down. TJ nervously sat, wringing his hands in his lap.</p><p>\u201cI want you to know that something like this wouldn\u2019t change things for the worse between us, okay?\u201d</p><p>TJ nodded in response, but he kept his gaze down, not willing himself to look at Cyrus. He didn\u2019t want to start crying, not now. Noticing his distress, Cyrus placed a hand on top of TJ\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2026I\u2019m really glad you said something because I like you too, you know?\u201d</p><p>TJ felt the tips of his ears burn at that, and he looked up at Cyrus, a hopeful smile on his face. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus giggled, nodding. \u201cYes, really!\u201d</p><p>TJ felt his whole body relax, and he leaned back on the bed, staring up at the ceiling. \u201cSo\u2026would you maybe want to go on a date with me?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus counted to three in his head before he tackled TJ with a hug. \u201cYes, you dork, I would <i>love </i>to go on a date with you!\u201d</p><p>They stayed like that for a little bit, before they sat up, hands intertwined. Cyrus reached down and pulled out the pride flag from underneath his bed, waving it around. TJ grinned, holding it with him.</p><hr><p>Exactly two days and eight hours later, TJ and Cyrus walked into the coffee shop, hand in hand, both excited and thoroughly nervous for their first date. Cyrus ended up ordering the \u2018Cyrus Special\u2019, while TJ was too excited to order anything.</p><p>They talked quietly until their server brought the order, winking, and making TJ blush like mad. He glanced over to Cyrus, a fond smile on his face. \u201cYou look unbearably adorable right now.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus grinned, letting a soft laugh escape his through his lips. \u201cDon\u2019t make me blush like this,\u201d he practically whined.</p><p>TJ leaned in a little closer, knocking their knees together. \u201cLike what, hmm?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 smile turned into a small smirk, his eyes glimmering. \u201cBet you can\u2019t get closer to me?\u201d</p><p>TJ laughed softly, before leaning forward and kissing him. Cyrus tastes like vanilla and mint, and it\u2019s everything he\u2019s ever wanted. No other kiss could compare to this one.</p><p>When they pull away, TJ\u2019s eyes stay closed for a little while before fluttering open, and landing on Cyrus, who was nearly on the verge of tears.</p><p>\u201cWait, did I do something wrong?\u201d TJ worried, placing his hand on top of Cyrus\u2019, but then removing it.</p><p>Cyrus shakes his head, choking out a watery laugh. \u201cNo, no, I\u2019m just\u2026so insanely happy,\u201d he admitted, after which TJ pulled him close, wrapping his arms around Cyrus and enjoying the moment. He could confidently say this was the best first date ever.</p><hr><p>The following Monday, Cyrus came in and greeted TJ with a kiss on the cheek, to which Marty reacted as if TJ had just sprouted a second head.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Marty trailed.</p><p>TJ chuckled, shrugging. \u201cYes, dumbass, we\u2019re dating.\u201d</p><p>Marty broke out into a grin, shoving TJ a little and slapping his arm over and over. \u201cDude, finally! Who confessed first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>Marty\u2019s face dropped at that, and Buffy popped out of seemingly nowhere (it wasn\u2019t nowhere, it was actually from behind the counter).</p><p>\u201cHa! I told you! You owe me the drink of my choice,\u201d she stated victoriously.</p><p>\u201cYou <i>bet </i>on us?\u201d TJ asked incredulously.</p><p>Buffy chuckled, nodding. \u201cAt least you guys got your heads out of your asses and confessed to each other.\u201d</p><p>TJ looked over at Cyrus, who was sitting and working on his laptop, with a fond smile. \u201cYeah. At least that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019ll it be?\u201d Marty asked, grabbing a cup and a pen.</p><p>\u201cHmm, I think I want my own drink,\u201d she decided, \u201cthe \u2018Buffy Blitz\u2019, if you will. A latte with two pumps of caramel, and three of white chocolate, topped with whipped cream and shaved chocolate.\u201d</p><p>Marty scribbled away on the cup. \u201cComing right up, your highness.\u201d</p><p>After he finished the order, they decided to close up a little early, and all four of them sat together at a table for a double date. It was one of their favorite experiences to date.</p><hr><p>When TJ graduated from college, he ended up becoming the school psychologist for Jefferson Middle School and he opened a coffee shop on the side, which he and his sister Amber co-owned.</p><p>Cyrus went on to study during his graduate years, and would always come by to grab his coffee, which TJ would always have a coffee ready for him. He would still wear the pride pin that he had kept all these years, and there was even a small pride flag around the tip jar.</p><p>The menu was made up of the classic drinks, but there were also specialty drinks, which were all named after his friends. Cyrus sometimes got a different order, but the one that TJ named after him would forever be his favorite.</p><p>One day, after TJ\u2019s shift, he and Cyrus took the long way back to Cyrus\u2019 apartment, taking in the beautiful buds that were soon going to bloom into flowers, and admiring the way the sun fell through the leaves. Even if it was the long way back, it still felt too short, too soon to part, at least to TJ. Cyrus seemed to pick up on this, giving him a soft smile and taking his hand in his own.</p><p>\u201cCome in, stay for a little while,\u201d Cyrus offered.</p><p>TJ shrugged, kicking at the ground. \u201cNo, that\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll have to leave anyways.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus waited a beat, taking a small step towards TJ. \u201cI mean, you could always move in with me.\u201d</p><p>TJ looked up at him so fast he swore he heard his neck snap. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus giggled, tugging him inside. \u201cLook, I know it\u2019s kind of small and cramped but\u2026we could make it work. What do you say?\u201d</p><p>TJ could barely believe what he was hearing. He stared for a few moments, before wrapping his arms around Cyrus and spinning him around. \u201cYes, oh my gosh, I\u2019d love to!\u201d</p><p>Peals of laughter filled the room, the two boys happier than ever before.</p><p>TJ put him down, his smile softening. \u201cYou know, I told myself I wouldn\u2019t move in with someone unless I was getting married.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus raised his brows, smirking. \u201cWell, well, well. Might just have to propose one of these days then, huh?\u201d</p><p>TJ laughed a little, pressing a kiss to Cyrus\u2019 temple and wrapping an arm around him. \u201cOkay, sure, whatever you say, Cy.\u201d</p><hr><p>Two months later, when they were both sitting under the covers, watching a movie, Cyrus turned to TJ and said, \u201cWe should get married.\u201d</p><p>TJ just looked at him, pausing the movie. \u201cCyrus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, only if you want to, you know,\u201d Cyrus shrugged, looking up into his eyes, \u201cbut\u2026if you do, that\u2019d be cool.\u201d</p><p>That night, Cyrus saw what was quite possibly the most beautiful smile on TJ\u2019s face. \u201cThere\u2019s no one else I\u2019d rather be with,\u201d he smiled, leaning in for a kiss. Cyrus seemed to always taste like vanilla and mint, and if that\u2019s what it would be like for the rest of their lives, that was just okay with him.</p><p>Cyrus pulled back from the kiss, his eyes still closed, and leaned on TJ\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI love you, TJ.\u201d</p><p>TJ smiled at the boy in his arms. He remembered when they had barely just met; TJ had no idea how important Cyrus would become to him. He couldn\u2019t imagine his life without the brunet.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Cy.\u201d</p></p>",

Keep up the good work!\u201d</p><p>TJ walked out of the gym, wiping his sweat with the hem of his shirt. He quickly hopped into the shower and turned the water on, sighing softly. It was nice, just sitting here and letting the water hit him, but he had a shift soon, so he needed to get going. Drying himself off with a towel and changing into his clothes, he headed out the door, nearly running down the street.</p><p>Pushing open the door to the cafe, he was reminded of why he took this job in the first place. There was really nothing better than the smell of coffee to make him feel happy. He slipped on his apron and his nametag, hopping behind the counter and prepping the machines.</p><p>\u201cOh good, you\u2019re here,\u201d Marty said, untying his apron and putting his elbows on the counter. He seemed exceptionally mopey today.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re just so thankful I\u2019m here to handle our-\u201d he looked out into the store, counting the customers with exaggeration, \u201cthree customers, one of which already has a coffee?\u201d</p><p>Marty rolled his eyes, nudging TJ\u2019s shoulder and sighing loudly. \u201cI\u2019m just glad I have someone to talk to.\u201d</p><p>TJ chuckled, running his hands along the coffee machine. \u201cAh, yes. Your little flirty friend isn\u2019t here to keep you company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, her name\u2019s Buffy,\u201d he started with an exasperated tone, \u201cand second of all, she\u2019s not my flirty friend. She\u2019s just my friend.\u201d</p><p>TJ snorted. \u201cSays the guy who continuously writes pick-up lines on her orders.\u201d</p><p>Marty spotted a few people coming in, and started grabbing a couple of cups, without thinking. \u201cWhen are you going to stop bugging me about my love life and start focusing on yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I find a cute boy, who also likes cute boys,\u201d TJ commented, retying his apron.</p><p>\u201cOh, you think you\u2019re cute, Kippen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d</p><p>Marty shook his head, walking towards the exit. \u201cSee you later.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<hr><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to die,\u201d Cyrus groaned, throwing himself onto his bed.</p><p>Buffy took a seat by him, patting his back. \u201cYou won\u2019t die. You say this every semester, Cy, and you always make it through. This week\u2019s gonna be rough, but I promise that you\u2019ll do fine.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus sighed, rolling onto his back and staring at the ceiling. \u201cI\u2019ve never had to write a paper this long before, and I just kept putting it off, and now I only have a week? On top of studying for midterms? I\u2019m going to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust\u2026go and grab a coffee or something, to, you know, keep you going,\u201d she suggested, and he perked up at that.</p><p>\u201cCome with me?\u201d Cyrus asked, almost pleadingly.</p><p>Buffy hesitated. \u201cI would but\u2026I kind of already promised someone that I would hang out with them today after classes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have midterms too?\u201d</p><p>Buffy smiled proudly, crossing her arms. \u201cPerks of playing a sport at the collegiate level is that I get to take midterms early. \u2018Cause of the game schedule. It actually works out quite nicely.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus sighed, leaning back against the back of his bed. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make me go and interact with the barista and order a coffee? You know I\u2019m just going to stumble on my own words.\u201d</p><p>She placed a comforting hand on his shoulder, as if to try and reassure him. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be fine. You\u2019ve done it before. Plus, what\u2019s the worst that could happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see a cute boy and short circuit, forget my name, he thinks I have amnesia and he takes me to a hospital where they find out that I have-\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he caught his breath, pinching the bridge of his nose, \u201cdream I had. Fine, I\u2019ll go\u2026but <i>please</i>, can\u2019t you come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already promised Marty that I\u2019d-\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarty?\u201d Cyrus interrupted her, \u201cyou mean that guy that you\u2019re always flirting with at the coffee shop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not flirting! We\u2019re just friends, and he invited me to go bowling.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smirked, crossing his arms. \u201cAnd are you going with a group of friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no,\u201d she answered, shaking her head, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus waved her off, ushering her out of his room. \u201cYeah, yeah, it\u2019s a date, even if you won\u2019t admit it. Tell me about it afterwards. Also wear a blue shirt, it brings out your eyes.\u201d</p><p>He closed the door before she could say anything else, and started to pack his backpack full of things he would need to work. Normally, he would work in the library, but during midterms week, he always found it either too quiet or too loud. The coffee shop seemed to have the perfect blend of quiet chatter in the background in order to keep him focused on his work, and not allow him to listen to his thoughts. It was a good environment to work in. Probably one of his favorites. He knew he couldn\u2019t stay away no matter if he was alone or with a friend.</p><p>And that\u2019s how Cyrus found himself rushing to coffee shop during the rain, papers in hand, sliding through the door and plopping himself down in his usual seat; a booth near one of the windows. He started setting up his computer, plugging it into the outlet, and turning it on. Pulling out a folder of his, he shuffled through piles of paper to find the one with the assignment. That\u2019s when he decided to go up and order, running a hand through his hair.</p><p>TJ saw the boy approaching, and swore that for a split second, he lost his breath. With his soft brown hair sweeping across his forehead, slightly upturned nose, and rosy complexion, he was, in short, beautiful.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>TJ snapped out of his reverie at the boy\u2019s words. He looked down at him, slightly flushed. \u201cSorry, what can I get for you?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus sighed, squinting up at the menu and then just bowing his head slightly. \u201cCan I just get five espressos, but all in one cup?\u201d</p><p>If TJ were holding a cup in his hand, he would have dropped it. Picking one up from the stack, he started to write on it. \u201cThat\u2019s bound to kill you.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus shrugged with one shoulder, smiling a little bit. \u201cIt\u2019s either that or exams, so I\u2019d rather it be coffee that gives me the sweet release of death.\u201d</p><p>TJ laughed out loud at that, smiling far too widely given what Cyrus said. It wasn\u2019t particularly hilarious, but it sure seemed that way to TJ. Maybe it was just because the boy in front of him was exceptionally cute.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you, going to med school or something?\u201d TJ wondered aloud, scooping some of the coffee grounds into a container.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m a double major,\u201d he replied, leaning against the counter.</p><p>TJ nodded. \u201cAh, the silent killer.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus laughed so hard at that he snorted, immediately flushing a deep shade of red. Oh, Buffy was going to get an earful of this later.</p><p>Meanwhile TJ was trying to keep his composure and not spill the coffee grounds all over the place. Turning on the machine, it started to hum and drip the espresso into a cup. He had to continuously add more grounds to make it to five shots, but he eventually got there. Capping the cup, he slid it over to Cyrus, before noticing the pile of stuff, which he assumed was his, in the corner of the shop.</p><p>\u201cOh shoot, I assumed this was to go, sorry,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>Cyrus waved him off, sliding him the money for the coffee. \u201cThat\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll stay here, keep you company, seeing as there are almost no people here,\u201d he laughed a little.</p><p>TJ ignored him for the moment, focusing intensely on getting the amount of change right, and handing it to the other boy. \u201cDon\u2019t you have studying to do\u2026I would use your full name, but I don\u2019t even know your first name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Cyrus squinted at his nametag, \u201cTJ, studying can wait. I\u2019m Cyrus, by the way.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus. What a beautiful name to match a beautiful person. \u201cWell, that\u2019s cool then. Maybe I\u2019ll just take my break now,\u201d he decided, walking out from behind the counter.</p><p>During the time that they talked, Cyrus learned that TJ was here on a basketball scholarship, but that he was majoring in psychology, with the intent of becoming a school counselor, and a minor in gender studies.</p><p>\u201cWhat made you wanna minor in that?\u201d Cyrus asked, sipping his all too bitter coffee, and making a face about it.</p><p>TJ smiled shyly, sliding him a couple of sugar packets. \u201cOh, uh, I guess it just sounded cool, or something,\u201d he mumbled, trying to brush it off.</p><p>Cyrus made a mental note to himself that TJ looked cute when he was slightly flustered. \u201cThat\u2019s cool. Sounds really interesting.\u201d</p><p>TJ learned that Cyrus was double majoring in film and journalism, with the intent of either becoming a playwright or a writer. He still didn\u2019t know which one he wanted to pursue; as he sipped his coffee, he seemed to talk faster and faster, which increasingly worried TJ.</p><p>\u201cHang out here for a while, alright?\u201d TJ told him, getting up from his seat, \u201cI\u2019ll walk you back after I finish my shift.\u201d</p><p>Small groups of people filtered in during the rest of TJ\u2019s shift, and he kept an eye on Cyrus all the while, who was typing away on his computer like a mad man. He couldn\u2019t help but smile at that as he made the seemingly endless streams of chai lattes.</p><hr><p>TJ finished up his shift on a good note, and he even had time to clean some of the equipment at the end of his shift, before he hung up his apron in the back room and walked out to where Cyrus was sitting, his leg bouncing uncontrollably. </p><p>\u201cAlright, time to head out,\u201d TJ said, to which Cyrus pouted and shut his laptop, shoving it in his bag.</p><p>\u201cI was so close to finishing my last paper, though!\u201d he whined, getting up and nearly hopping towards the door.</p><p>TJ chuckled, falling in step with him. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll get to finish it once you get back to your dorm\u2026which I\u2019m just now realizing I don\u2019t know where it is. Care to lead the way?\u201d</p><p>And lead the way he did. Cyrus had never felt more energetic in his life; was this how athletic people felt? It was incredible. He even went up the stairs without feeling completely winded at the top. All the while, TJ was admiring him with a fond smile on his face. He had just met Cyrus this afternoon, but he felt like he\u2019d known him his entire life.</p><p>Once they reached Cyrus\u2019 dorm, his frantic energy seemed to calm down a little, as he opened the door and stood in the threshold, turning to face TJ.</p><p>\u201cThanks for walking me back,\u201d he said, and he was a bit more calm than he\u2019d been previously, \u201cyou didn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>TJ shrugged, putting his hands in his pockets, looking around the room. He saw a small pride flag on one of the tables, but he tried to tell himself it was probably Cyrus\u2019 roommate\u2019s. \u201cBut I <i>wanted </i>to.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to, and Cyrus thought it was so sweet of him. He\u2019d only known TJ for the time that they\u2019d spent at the coffee shop, but he already felt so close to him, like they were best friends. Without thinking, he stepped forward and wrapped his arms around TJ in a hug.</p><p>TJ didn\u2019t really respond for a second; a hug was the last thing he was expecting, and yet, here he was. It was really nice, actually, but by the time TJ had actually started to put his arms around Cyrus, the boy pulled back, mortified, and shut the door.</p><p>TJ waited outside Cyrus\u2019 door for a minute, waiting to see if maybe he\u2019d open it again and talk to him. But after a little while, he left, shaking his head.</p><hr><p>For the next few days, Cyrus avoided the coffee shop like the plague. Buffy came in to get his orders, and by the time she delivered it to him, it was cold because she\u2019d been talking to Marty about their next date.</p><p><i>\u201cYou guys are going out on a date?\u201d Cyrus had exclaimed, his eyes bugging out of his head.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal,\u201d she brushed it off, grabbing a piece of her hair and twirling it around between her fingers.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus took a sip of his coffee, smirking. \u201cOh, please, you\u2019re so smitten with him and you\u2019re excited that he asked you out.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYour words, not mine.\u201d</i></p><p>TJ\u2019s head snapped up every time the bell rang above the door, but he never saw Cyrus enter. He sighed, pouring the milk into the cup before Marty came up by him and snatched it out of his hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d TJ snapped, crossing his arms.</p><p>\u201cThe order is for soy milk, not two percent! Are you trying to actively kill our customers?\u201d Marty carded his fingers through his hair, exasperated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bad with numbers,\u201d TJ mumbled, grabbing a new cup.</p><p>Marty shook his head, taking the cup from TJ\u2019s hands. \u201cYou\u2019re not like this even when you pull an allnighter. What\u2019s going on, dude?\u201d</p><p>TJ sighed, leaning back against the counter. He started to explain everything, from the moment that Cyrus walked in, to when they walked back to his dorm together, to when Cyrus hugged him and them pulled away immediately.</p><p>\u201cThat pretty much brings us up to date,\u201d he said plainly, grabbing a rag and wiping down the counter, while Marty stared at him with wide eyes.</p><p>\u201cJust talk to him, dude,\u201d he told him, nudging him a little, \u201cI\u2019m sure things are still fine between you two.\u201d</p><p>TJ just shrugged, and continued on with his shift like a robot, going through the movements with little effort. The end of his shift came pretty quickly, and he ended up spending some time at the courts shooting hoops, until his phone buzzed.</p><p><b>[Marty: go talk to him or so help me]</b></p><hr><p>Somehow, TJ found himself going up the stairs in Cyrus\u2019 dorm complex, and towards his room. He stood outside the door for a little bit, trying to collect his thoughts and think of something to say that would make sense. Tentatively, he rapped his knuckles on the door and waited.</p><p>Soft footsteps were heard from inside, and Cyrus opened the door. All of TJ\u2019s planning to say something comprehensible went out the window when he saw him; Cyrus was wearing clothes that were way too big for him, and he had glasses on this time.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi,\u201d Cyrus said quietly, snapping TJ out of his thoughts.</p><p>\u201c\u2026hey,\u201d he mumbled, clearing his throat, \u201ccan I talk to you for a second? If you have a class that\u2019s fine, I can come back later, or-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-I have time right now,\u201d Cyrus cut in, stepping aside and letting TJ in. He shut the door, his head pounding in his chest, and turned around to see TJ sitting on the ground. Cyrus found that amusing and a little bit cute, but he tried to quell that voice in his head. He took a seat by TJ, pulling his knees into his chest.</p><p>\u201cDid I\u2026do something wrong?\u201d TJ asked quietly, looking down at the ground.</p><p>Cyrus immediately turned to look at him, a worried look etched into his face. \u201cWhat? No! What would make you say that?\u201d</p><p>TJ shrugged, picking at a fray string in the rug. \u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know, I guess since I haven\u2019t seen you much around the coffee shop that\u2026I did something wrong.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus drew in a breath, gnawing on his lower lip. \u201cRight,\u201d he mumbled, \u201cbut\u2026you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I did.\u201d</p><p>TJ looked up from the ground for the first time, unable to meet Cyrus\u2019 gaze since the other boy was looking up at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus closed his eyes. \u201cAfter you walked me back to my dorm and I just\u2026hugged you, I wasn\u2019t thinking straight\u2026sorry.\u201d</p><p>TJ nearly chuckled at \u2018not thinking straight\u2019, but kept a solemn face. \u201cYou think I\u2019m, like, mad at you for that?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus shrugged, opening his eyes and looking at TJ. \u201cI\u2026guess not mad, but weirded out because I\u2019m-\u201d</p><p>He stopped, not letting any more words flow out of his mouth. He surprised himself in that moment; he almost came out to TJ without so much as a second thought to how he might react.</p><p>TJ seemed to pick up on Cyrus\u2019 discomfort, and shifted a little. \u201cI\u2019m not weirded out, Cyrus,\u201d he said, pausing for a beat, \u201cI\u2026I actually liked it.\u201d</p><p>Now it was Cyrus\u2019 turn to be a little surprised, meeting TJ\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>TJ nodded, unable to keep looking at Cyrus, so he opted for looking around the room to try and find something to distract himself. The pride flag on the desk caught his attention, and he picked it up, twirling it around in his hand.</p><p>\u201cI like this,\u201d he said softly, holding it delicately.</p><p>\u201cY-You do?\u201d Cyrus stammered, trying to gauge his reaction.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus took this as a good sign, and, feeling a little bold, said \u201cIt\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>TJ turned to him with a smile so bright that it could eclipse the sun\u2019s rays. \u201cReally? That\u2019s cool. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have the courage to have one in my room.\u201d He breathed out shakily after that; he didn\u2019t really plan on coming out today, to Cyrus, but the moment just felt right.</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 smile softened, opening one of his drawers and rifling around in it. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to make it a big deal, just,\u201d he popped his head up, handing TJ a pin, \u201chere, take it.\u201d</p><p>TJ turned the pin over and over in his hand. It was a rainbow one, with the words \u2018you are loved\u2019 painted on top in black. He smiled, slipping it into his pocket. \u201cThank you, Cyrus. Will I be seeing you around the coffee shop again?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus giggled, throwing his head back; TJ didn\u2019t think he\u2019d heard such a beautiful laugh. \u201cDo the gays flock together?\u201d</p><p>TJ chuckled, standing up. \u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><hr><p>Things seemed to get a lot better after that day. Cyrus started coming in and ordering coffee during TJ\u2019s shifts, and TJ was glad to see that the boy had returned. He\u2019d even started wearing his pride pin on his apron. Sure, he was a little nervous to do so for the first few days, but after a few people had complimented him on it, he was much happier to wear it.</p><p>It\u2019d been about a month of Cyrus coming in, ordering coffee, spending a little too much time talking to TJ, and then working frantically on his schoolwork.</p><p>It was a relatively quiet Wednesday afternoon, the business of the coffee shop had come to a gentle lull. TJ was steaming some milk for an order, when Marty came up beside him, leaning against the counter.</p><p>\u201cSo, how long have you been dating him?\u201d</p><p>TJ nearly spilled the milk on him, pretty much dropping the cup onto the counter, some of the milk sloshing around and spilling on the counter. \u201cWhat?\u201d he squeaked, grabbing a rag, and wiping up his mess.</p><p>Marty rolled his eyes, handing TJ a clean rag. \u201cYou and that kid who keeps coming here?\u201d he pointed to Cyrus, who was making gestures at his computer, since he was studying for his ASL test.</p><p>TJ flushed an embarrassing shade of pink, kicking at the ground below him. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2026we\u2019re not dating, Marty.\u201d</p><p>Marty groaned, sitting up on the counter. \u201cSure, dude. He just happens to be here whenever your shifts are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s definitely not true,\u201d TJ shot back quietly, sneaking a glance over at Cyrus, who was deep in concentration, \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s here other times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever here when I\u2019m here working without you,\u201d Marty said calmly, shooting TJ a smirk.</p><p>TJ tried to keep his composure on the outside, but on the inside, he was melting. He tried not to read too much into the situation, but he couldn\u2019t help himself. He looked over at Cyrus, who smiled up at him and signed \u2018hi TJ\u2019. It was so cute, he just kind of stared at him until he felt something, or rather someone, slap his arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that for?\u201d TJ scolded, rubbing his arm where it had just been hit.</p><p>\u201cYou were staring,\u201d Marty pointed out.</p><p>\u201cWas not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas too.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, before any more arguing could be done, Buffy walked through the door, smiling brightly at Marty, and taking a seat with Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s Buffy, huh?\u201d TJ crossed his arms, leaning back against the counter.</p><p>Now it was Marty\u2019s turn to be flustered, turning pink. \u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>TJ nudged him. \u201cYou never smile like that.\u201d</p><p>Marty glanced over at Buffy and Cyrus, seeing them deep in conversation, hands moving wildly. Hopping beside TJ, he shook him, effectively spilling ice all over the floor and pointed to Cyrus and Buffy.</p><p>\u201cMarty, I love you, but if you don\u2019t fucking stop shaking me I will pour hot coffee into your sneakers,\u201d TJ threatened, bending down to pick up the ice, Marty helping him a little.</p><p>TJ stood up, letting Marty pick up the rest of the cubes, and ran a hand through his hair. Some of it flopped over his forehead, since he\u2019d run out of hair gel and hadn\u2019t had a chance to get some more. He grabbed another cup, remaking the iced coffee order.</p><p>Meanwhile, Buffy was sizing him up, as Cyrus sat typing away. \u201cSo <i>this </i>is the boy you keep talking about, huh?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus huffed beside her, grabbing a few of his papers and sifting through them. \u201cOh hush, he\u2019s cute and you know it.\u201d</p><p>Buffy shrugged, leaning back in the booth seat. \u201cI <i>guess </i>I can see why you like him,\u201d she agreed, scrolling through her phone for a while, Cyrus doing work next to her.</p><p>After a little while, TJ came up to where he was sitting, and cleared his throat, setting down a coffee cup.</p><p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t order anything,\u201d Cyrus said, nudging the cup away, but TJ held it firmly on the table.</p><p>\u201cI know. This one\u2019s on me. I thought you could use a break from all that strong coffee you drink,\u201d he laughed a little, pushing his hair back. Buffy glanced over at Cyrus, who was blushing at the gesture.</p><p>Cyrus eyed the drink with suspicion. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>TJ smirked a little, leaning against the table. \u201cMy special drink. It\u2019s a secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I know you\u2019re not trying to poison me?\u201d</p><p>TJ\u2019s eyes widened a little. \u201cCyrus, really? You think I would poison my favorite person?\u201d</p><p>Buffy choked on her spit at that, getting both boys to look at her, but she waved them off, going back to her phone.</p><p>Cyrus was now insanely flustered, and couldn\u2019t function as well as he wanted to, so he carefully took the cup into his hands, and took a small sip. It was almost like hot chocolate, but with a hint of vanilla and mint. \u201cThis is\u2026really, really good.\u201d</p><p>TJ smiled at his work. \u201cI\u2019m glad you like it. I\u2019ll call it the \u2018Cyrus Special\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus laughed a little at that, shaking his head. He went back to his studying, talking to Buffy, and answering her questions about TJ. His drink was gone in record time, and he figured he\u2019d miss it a little.</p><hr><p>When Cyrus came in the next day, however, there was a small chalkboard sign on the counter, which said \u2018try the Cyrus Special: A Minty Vanilla Wonderland\u2019. Still in shock, Cyrus approached the counter, and got TJ\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cYou actually made a drink for me?\u201d he asked, his voice soft and filled with wonder and fondness.</p><p>TJ returned the smile. \u201cI said I would, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to order one then,\u201d he chuckled, handing him the money and placing the change in the tip jar.</p><p>TJ was busy cleaning the counters in the back, so Marty took care of the order. However, when he saw the name written on the cup, he took the liberty of drawing hearts all around the remaining space, and smiling to himself.</p><p>\u201cOne Cyrus Special!\u201d Marty called out, chuckling a little to himself.</p><p>Cyrus closed his laptop and set it on top of the table, putting his phone in his pocket and heading up to the counter. He picked up his drink, but couldn\u2019t help but notice the hearts drawn all over his name. He looked between the cup and Marty, as if to say \u2018what the hell\u2019.</p><p>\u201cYou like him, don\u2019t you?\u201d he asked, giddy with excitement like a child.</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 grip tightened around the drink, swallowing the lump in his throat. \u201cWh-what?\u201d</p><p>Marty sighed, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. \u201cTJ! He likes you a lot!\u201d</p><p>The world seemed to stop spinning right then and there, as TJ walked out from behind the counter and froze. He could feel the blood rushing from his head, and his chest suddenly felt like it was being crushed. Cyrus was looking between Marty and TJ, a look of confusion and worry on his face.</p><p>Marty fumbled with something to say. \u201cOh, uh, I mean, I mean that he talks to you like-like a friend, and he likes that you, uh, when you come in and talk, or, uh-\u201d</p><p>TJ couldn\u2019t take it anymore; he hopped over the counter and ran out the door, making a sharp right and taking off. Cyrus took one sip of his coffee, set it down on the counter, and took off running after TJ. It was harder for him, since he wasn\u2019t athletically gifted, but TJ was important to him, so no matter how badly his legs burned or his lungs ached, he kept running.</p><p>He eventually saw him, sitting under a cherry tree that was almost ready to bloom. His apron was tossed to the side, and as Cyrus got closer, he could see that he was holding the pride pin in his hand.</p><p>Cyrus came up to him, taking a seat on the grass and taking a few moments to gulp down air, trying to catch his breath. \u201cTJ-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-what?\u201d he cut in, sharply. It took Cyrus by surprise, TJ\u2019s tone, but he didn\u2019t linger on that too long.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026I just wanted to see if you\u2019re okay and-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-I don\u2019t need your pity,\u201d he grumbled, holding the pin tighter in his hand.</p><p>Cyrus shrank into himself, trying to press down the lump in his throat. \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, TJ, I just\u2026look, about what Marty said, I-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-I don\u2019t need your pity or your help! Can you just back off?\u201d TJ shouted, standing up in a bout of anger, dropping the pin, and stomping on it, effectively breaking it into pieces. It might as well have been Cyrus\u2019 heart that he stepped on; that\u2019s how it felt to Cyrus, at least.</p><p>Cyrus brought a hand up to his mouth, his fingers trembling over his lips. For a split second, TJ looked apologetic, but Cyrus didn\u2019t give himself the time to ponder over his facial expressions He just took off running back to his dorm; he was tired, everything ached, and the hot tears spilling down his cheeks made his vision blurry, but he didn\u2019t stop until he reached his dorm, slamming the door behind him and collapsing on the bed. He couldn\u2019t be thankful enough that his roommate was out.</p><p>Cyrus didn\u2019t know how long he spent, clutching the pillow to his chest and crying into it. At some point, he shakily grabbed the pride flag on top of his desk and shoved it underneath his bed. This was the worst he\u2019d ever felt in his entire life; TJ hadn\u2019t even been in his life for that long, but it felt like he\u2019d just lost the most important person to him. After a while of trying not to cry, followed by crying, he took his phone out of his pocket and texted Buffy.</p><p><b>[Me: can you pick up my stuff from the coffee shop? i left it there and i\u2019m in my dorm]</b></p><p><b>[Buffy: what? why??]</b></p><p><b>[Me: long story, i don\u2019t feel like talking about it right now, please?]</b></p><p><b>[Buffy:\u2026okay]</b></p><p>He waited in his room, until after around twenty minutes there were footsteps \u00a0near his door, and a soft \u2018thump\u2019 on his door.</p><p>\u201cCyrus? I brought your stuff. I hope you\u2019re okay, text me when you can,\u201d she said, walking off.</p><p>Cyrus waited five minutes before he opened the door and picked up his things. He saw that she\u2019s also brought his coffee, with his name and hearts still on the cup. Taking it in his hand, he took a sip; it was cold now, but it still tasted good. Unfortunately, it still reminded him of TJ, so he ended up throwing it out, before resigning back to his bed for the rest of the day.</p><hr><p>TJ took the next few days off of work; he couldn\u2019t handle being in there for a while, but he couldn\u2019t avoid it for too long; he needed the money.</p><p>When he rolled in on Monday morning, and saw Marty behind the counter, casually wiping it down, he made a beeline to him, narrowing his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou absolute idiot!\u201d he shrieked, yanking on his apron.</p><p>Marty glanced up from the counter, raising a brow. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you \u2018what\u2019 me Marty! You told Cyrus that I liked him!\u201d he whispered harshly, his gaze flitting around the shop, \u201cthat was supposed to be a secret.\u201d</p><p>Marty groaned, turning on the machines. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a secret that you two are flirting.\u201d</p><p>TJ\u2019s eyes widened, crossing his arms. \u201cWhat does <i>that </i>mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you not see the way he looks at you or talks to you? I\u2019m like almost a hundred percent sure that he likes you,\u201d he told him.</p><p>TJ sighed sadly, washing a cup. \u201cWell now there\u2019s no chance of that happening.\u201d</p><p>Marty didn\u2019t look up. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>TJ hesitated, fidgeting with the loose ends of his apron ties. \u201cI kind of snapped at him after what happened that day and we haven\u2019t spoken since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to work things out with him, dude. You know that right?\u201d</p><p>TJ nodded. \u201cYeah, I know. I just have no idea what to do.\u201d</p><p>Marty grabbed the milk out of the fridge, and started to make himself a coffee, dropping a few bills into the tip jar. \u201cI have some idea.\u201d</p><hr><p>The following day, early in the afternoon, TJ climbed the stairs to Cyrus\u2019 dorm, his nerves increasing with each shaky step. Considering how close the two boys had been, TJ knew Cyrus\u2019 schedule with relative confidence. He stood outside of Cyrus\u2019 door for a full minute and a half before he knocked, so quietly that he wondered if Cyrus even heard it. After a beat, he heard footsteps from inside, and Cyrus opened the door.</p><p>The first emotion that came over TJ was guilt; Cyrus looked miserable, his hair all over the place, and it looked like he had been wearing the same clothes. He felt upset, mad at himself, but most of all he felt like a terrible human being because Cyrus started to shut the door. Thinking quickly, TJ shoved his foot in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Cyrus, can I talk to you?\u201d he pleaded; it sounded almost like a whimper.</p><p>Cyrus just blinked in response, not changing his facial expression or body positioning. TJ had really hurt him; he knew that he tended to forgive fairly easily, but he tried to force himself not to, at least in this instance.</p><p>TJ reached into his pocket, pulling out a new pride pin, and fumbling with it for a moment, before he attached it onto his shirt successfully. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about what I said and what I did. I was just\u2026so freaked out by what Marty said\u2026\u201d</p><p>Cyrus leaned against the doorframe. \u201cSo you decided to snap at me?\u201d</p><p>TJ ran a hand through his hair; Cyrus tried his best to not think about how cute he looked. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I got scared because\u2026because he\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus raised a brow, his cold demeanor now replaced with a confused one.</p><p>\u201cI like you, Cyrus, okay? Marty saying that\u2026it scared me, I was worried it would ruin things between us,\u201d he said, his voice getting softer as he spoke.</p><p>Cyrus didn\u2019t say anything, he just ushered TJ inside, shutting the door behind him. He took a seat on the bed, patting the spot beside him for TJ to come and sit down. TJ nervously sat, wringing his hands in his lap.</p><p>\u201cI want you to know that something like this wouldn\u2019t change things for the worse between us, okay?\u201d</p><p>TJ nodded in response, but he kept his gaze down, not willing himself to look at Cyrus. He didn\u2019t want to start crying, not now. Noticing his distress, Cyrus placed a hand on top of TJ\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2026I\u2019m really glad you said something because I like you too, you know?\u201d</p><p>TJ felt the tips of his ears burn at that, and he looked up at Cyrus, a hopeful smile on his face. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus giggled, nodding. \u201cYes, really!\u201d</p><p>TJ felt his whole body relax, and he leaned back on the bed, staring up at the ceiling. \u201cSo\u2026would you maybe want to go on a date with me?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus counted to three in his head before he tackled TJ with a hug. \u201cYes, you dork, I would <i>love </i>to go on a date with you!\u201d</p><p>They stayed like that for a little bit, before they sat up, hands intertwined. Cyrus reached down and pulled out the pride flag from underneath his bed, waving it around. TJ grinned, holding it with him.</p><hr><p>Exactly two days and eight hours later, TJ and Cyrus walked into the coffee shop, hand in hand, both excited and thoroughly nervous for their first date. Cyrus ended up ordering the \u2018Cyrus Special\u2019, while TJ was too excited to order anything.</p><p>They talked quietly until their server brought the order, winking, and making TJ blush like mad. He glanced over to Cyrus, a fond smile on his face. \u201cYou look unbearably adorable right now.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus grinned, letting a soft laugh escape his through his lips. \u201cDon\u2019t make me blush like this,\u201d he practically whined.</p><p>TJ leaned in a little closer, knocking their knees together. \u201cLike what, hmm?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 smile turned into a small smirk, his eyes glimmering. \u201cBet you can\u2019t get closer to me?\u201d</p><p>TJ laughed softly, before leaning forward and kissing him. Cyrus tastes like vanilla and mint, and it\u2019s everything he\u2019s ever wanted. No other kiss could compare to this one.</p><p>When they pull away, TJ\u2019s eyes stay closed for a little while before fluttering open, and landing on Cyrus, who was nearly on the verge of tears.</p><p>\u201cWait, did I do something wrong?\u201d TJ worried, placing his hand on top of Cyrus\u2019, but then removing it.</p><p>Cyrus shakes his head, choking out a watery laugh. \u201cNo, no, I\u2019m just\u2026so insanely happy,\u201d he admitted, after which TJ pulled him close, wrapping his arms around Cyrus and enjoying the moment. He could confidently say this was the best first date ever.</p><hr><p>The following Monday, Cyrus came in and greeted TJ with a kiss on the cheek, to which Marty reacted as if TJ had just sprouted a second head.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Marty trailed.</p><p>TJ chuckled, shrugging. \u201cYes, dumbass, we\u2019re dating.\u201d</p><p>Marty broke out into a grin, shoving TJ a little and slapping his arm over and over. \u201cDude, finally! Who confessed first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>Marty\u2019s face dropped at that, and Buffy popped out of seemingly nowhere (it wasn\u2019t nowhere, it was actually from behind the counter).</p><p>\u201cHa! I told you! You owe me the drink of my choice,\u201d she stated victoriously.</p><p>\u201cYou <i>bet </i>on us?\u201d TJ asked incredulously.</p><p>Buffy chuckled, nodding. \u201cAt least you guys got your heads out of your asses and confessed to each other.\u201d</p><p>TJ looked over at Cyrus, who was sitting and working on his laptop, with a fond smile. \u201cYeah. At least that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019ll it be?\u201d Marty asked, grabbing a cup and a pen.</p><p>\u201cHmm, I think I want my own drink,\u201d she decided, \u201cthe \u2018Buffy Blitz\u2019, if you will. A latte with two pumps of caramel, and three of white chocolate, topped with whipped cream and shaved chocolate.\u201d</p><p>Marty scribbled away on the cup. \u201cComing right up, your highness.\u201d</p><p>After he finished the order, they decided to close up a little early, and all four of them sat together at a table for a double date. It was one of their favorite experiences to date.</p><hr><p>When TJ graduated from college, he ended up becoming the school psychologist for Jefferson Middle School and he opened a coffee shop on the side, which he and his sister Amber co-owned.</p><p>Cyrus went on to study during his graduate years, and would always come by to grab his coffee, which TJ would always have a coffee ready for him. He would still wear the pride pin that he had kept all these years, and there was even a small pride flag around the tip jar.</p><p>The menu was made up of the classic drinks, but there were also specialty drinks, which were all named after his friends. Cyrus sometimes got a different order, but the one that TJ named after him would forever be his favorite.</p><p>One day, after TJ\u2019s shift, he and Cyrus took the long way back to Cyrus\u2019 apartment, taking in the beautiful buds that were soon going to bloom into flowers, and admiring the way the sun fell through the leaves. Even if it was the long way back, it still felt too short, too soon to part, at least to TJ. Cyrus seemed to pick up on this, giving him a soft smile and taking his hand in his own.</p><p>\u201cCome in, stay for a little while,\u201d Cyrus offered.</p><p>TJ shrugged, kicking at the ground. \u201cNo, that\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll have to leave anyways.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus waited a beat, taking a small step towards TJ. \u201cI mean, you could always move in with me.\u201d</p><p>TJ looked up at him so fast he swore he heard his neck snap. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus giggled, tugging him inside. \u201cLook, I know it\u2019s kind of small and cramped but\u2026we could make it work. What do you say?\u201d</p><p>TJ could barely believe what he was hearing. He stared for a few moments, before wrapping his arms around Cyrus and spinning him around. \u201cYes, oh my gosh, I\u2019d love to!\u201d</p><p>Peals of laughter filled the room, the two boys happier than ever before.</p><p>TJ put him down, his smile softening. \u201cYou know, I told myself I wouldn\u2019t move in with someone unless I was getting married.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus raised his brows, smirking. \u201cWell, well, well. Might just have to propose one of these days then, huh?\u201d</p><p>TJ laughed a little, pressing a kiss to Cyrus\u2019 temple and wrapping an arm around him. \u201cOkay, sure, whatever you say, Cy.\u201d</p><hr><p>Two months later, when they were both sitting under the covers, watching a movie, Cyrus turned to TJ and said, \u201cWe should get married.\u201d</p><p>TJ just looked at him, pausing the movie. \u201cCyrus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, only if you want to, you know,\u201d Cyrus shrugged, looking up into his eyes, \u201cbut\u2026if you do, that\u2019d be cool.\u201d</p><p>That night, Cyrus saw what was quite possibly the most beautiful smile on TJ\u2019s face. \u201cThere\u2019s no one else I\u2019d rather be with,\u201d he smiled, leaning in for a kiss. Cyrus seemed to always taste like vanilla and mint, and if that\u2019s what it would be like for the rest of their lives, that was just okay with him.</p><p>Cyrus pulled back from the kiss, his eyes still closed, and leaned on TJ\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI love you, TJ.\u201d</p><p>TJ smiled at the boy in his arms. He remembered when they had barely just met; TJ had no idea how important Cyrus would become to him. He couldn\u2019t imagine his life without the brunet.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Cy.\u201d</p></p>",

Keep up the good work!&rdquo;</p><p>TJ walked out of the gym, wiping his sweat with the hem of his shirt. He quickly hopped into the shower and turned the water on, sighing softly. It was nice, just sitting here and letting the water hit him, but he had a shift soon, so he needed to get going. Drying himself off with a towel and changing into his clothes, he headed out the door, nearly running down the street.</p><p>Pushing open the door to the cafe, he was reminded of why he took this job in the first place. There was really nothing better than the smell of coffee to make him feel happy. He slipped on his apron and his nametag, hopping behind the counter and prepping the machines.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh good, you&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; Marty said, untying his apron and putting his elbows on the counter. He seemed exceptionally mopey today.</p><p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re just so thankful I&rsquo;m here to handle our-&rdquo; he looked out into the store, counting the customers with exaggeration, &ldquo;three customers, one of which already has a coffee?&rdquo;</p><p>Marty rolled his eyes, nudging TJ&rsquo;s shoulder and sighing loudly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just glad I have someone to talk to.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ chuckled, running his hands along the coffee machine. &ldquo;Ah, yes. Your little flirty friend isn&rsquo;t here to keep you company.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;First of all, her name&rsquo;s Buffy,&rdquo; he started with an exasperated tone, &ldquo;and second of all, she&rsquo;s not my flirty friend. She&rsquo;s just my friend.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ snorted. &ldquo;Says the guy who continuously writes pick-up lines on her orders.&rdquo;</p><p>Marty spotted a few people coming in, and started grabbing a couple of cups, without thinking. &ldquo;When are you going to stop bugging me about my love life and start focusing on yours?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When I find a cute boy, who also likes cute boys,&rdquo; TJ commented, retying his apron.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you think you&rsquo;re cute, Kippen?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very.&rdquo;</p><p>Marty shook his head, walking towards the exit. &ldquo;See you later.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to die,&rdquo; Cyrus groaned, throwing himself onto his bed.</p><p>Buffy took a seat by him, patting his back. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t die. You say this every semester, Cy, and you always make it through. This week&rsquo;s gonna be rough, but I promise that you&rsquo;ll do fine.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus sighed, rolling onto his back and staring at the ceiling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had to write a paper this long before, and I just kept putting it off, and now I only have a week? On top of studying for midterms? I&rsquo;m going to die.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just&hellip;go and grab a coffee or something, to, you know, keep you going,&rdquo; she suggested, and he perked up at that.</p><p>&ldquo;Come with me?&rdquo; Cyrus asked, almost pleadingly.</p><p>Buffy hesitated. &ldquo;I would but&hellip;I kind of already promised someone that I would hang out with them today after classes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have midterms too?&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy smiled proudly, crossing her arms. &ldquo;Perks of playing a sport at the collegiate level is that I get to take midterms early. &lsquo;Cause of the game schedule. It actually works out quite nicely.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus sighed, leaning back against the back of his bed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to make me go and interact with the barista and order a coffee? You know I&rsquo;m just going to stumble on my own words.&rdquo;</p><p>She placed a comforting hand on his shoulder, as if to try and reassure him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna be fine. You&rsquo;ve done it before. Plus, what&rsquo;s the worst that could happen?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I see a cute boy and short circuit, forget my name, he thinks I have amnesia and he takes me to a hospital where they find out that I have-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he caught his breath, pinching the bridge of his nose, &ldquo;dream I had. Fine, I&rsquo;ll go&hellip;but <i>please</i>, can&rsquo;t you come?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I already promised Marty that I&rsquo;d-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Marty?&rdquo; Cyrus interrupted her, &ldquo;you mean that guy that you&rsquo;re always flirting with at the coffee shop?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not flirting! We&rsquo;re just friends, and he invited me to go bowling.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus smirked, crossing his arms. &ldquo;And are you going with a group of friends?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; she answered, shaking her head, &ldquo;but that doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus waved her off, ushering her out of his room. &ldquo;Yeah, yeah, it&rsquo;s a date, even if you won&rsquo;t admit it. Tell me about it afterwards. Also wear a blue shirt, it brings out your eyes.&rdquo;</p><p>He closed the door before she could say anything else, and started to pack his backpack full of things he would need to work. Normally, he would work in the library, but during midterms week, he always found it either too quiet or too loud. The coffee shop seemed to have the perfect blend of quiet chatter in the background in order to keep him focused on his work, and not allow him to listen to his thoughts. It was a good environment to work in. Probably one of his favorites. He knew he couldn&rsquo;t stay away no matter if he was alone or with a friend.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s how Cyrus found himself rushing to coffee shop during the rain, papers in hand, sliding through the door and plopping himself down in his usual seat; a booth near one of the windows. He started setting up his computer, plugging it into the outlet, and turning it on. Pulling out a folder of his, he shuffled through piles of paper to find the one with the assignment. That&rsquo;s when he decided to go up and order, running a hand through his hair.</p><p>TJ saw the boy approaching, and swore that for a split second, he lost his breath. With his soft brown hair sweeping across his forehead, slightly upturned nose, and rosy complexion, he was, in short, beautiful.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ snapped out of his reverie at the boy&rsquo;s words. He looked down at him, slightly flushed. &ldquo;Sorry, what can I get for you?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus sighed, squinting up at the menu and then just bowing his head slightly. &ldquo;Can I just get five espressos, but all in one cup?&rdquo;</p><p>If TJ were holding a cup in his hand, he would have dropped it. Picking one up from the stack, he started to write on it. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s bound to kill you.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus shrugged with one shoulder, smiling a little bit. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s either that or exams, so I&rsquo;d rather it be coffee that gives me the sweet release of death.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ laughed out loud at that, smiling far too widely given what Cyrus said. It wasn&rsquo;t particularly hilarious, but it sure seemed that way to TJ. Maybe it was just because the boy in front of him was exceptionally cute.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you, going to med school or something?&rdquo; TJ wondered aloud, scooping some of the coffee grounds into a container.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m a double major,&rdquo; he replied, leaning against the counter.</p><p>TJ nodded. &ldquo;Ah, the silent killer.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus laughed so hard at that he snorted, immediately flushing a deep shade of red. Oh, Buffy was going to get an earful of this later.</p><p>Meanwhile TJ was trying to keep his composure and not spill the coffee grounds all over the place. Turning on the machine, it started to hum and drip the espresso into a cup. He had to continuously add more grounds to make it to five shots, but he eventually got there. Capping the cup, he slid it over to Cyrus, before noticing the pile of stuff, which he assumed was his, in the corner of the shop.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh shoot, I assumed this was to go, sorry,&rdquo; he mumbled.</p><p>Cyrus waved him off, sliding him the money for the coffee. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine, I&rsquo;ll stay here, keep you company, seeing as there are almost no people here,&rdquo; he laughed a little.</p><p>TJ ignored him for the moment, focusing intensely on getting the amount of change right, and handing it to the other boy. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have studying to do&hellip;I would use your full name, but I don&rsquo;t even know your first name.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Cyrus squinted at his nametag, &ldquo;TJ, studying can wait. I&rsquo;m Cyrus, by the way.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus. What a beautiful name to match a beautiful person. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s cool then. Maybe I&rsquo;ll just take my break now,&rdquo; he decided, walking out from behind the counter.</p><p>During the time that they talked, Cyrus learned that TJ was here on a basketball scholarship, but that he was majoring in psychology, with the intent of becoming a school counselor, and a minor in gender studies.</p><p>&ldquo;What made you wanna minor in that?&rdquo; Cyrus asked, sipping his all too bitter coffee, and making a face about it.</p><p>TJ smiled shyly, sliding him a couple of sugar packets. &ldquo;Oh, uh, I guess it just sounded cool, or something,&rdquo; he mumbled, trying to brush it off.</p><p>Cyrus made a mental note to himself that TJ looked cute when he was slightly flustered. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s cool. Sounds really interesting.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ learned that Cyrus was double majoring in film and journalism, with the intent of either becoming a playwright or a writer. He still didn&rsquo;t know which one he wanted to pursue; as he sipped his coffee, he seemed to talk faster and faster, which increasingly worried TJ.</p><p>&ldquo;Hang out here for a while, alright?&rdquo; TJ told him, getting up from his seat, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll walk you back after I finish my shift.&rdquo;</p><p>Small groups of people filtered in during the rest of TJ&rsquo;s shift, and he kept an eye on Cyrus all the while, who was typing away on his computer like a mad man. He couldn&rsquo;t help but smile at that as he made the seemingly endless streams of chai lattes.</p><hr /><p>TJ finished up his shift on a good note, and he even had time to clean some of the equipment at the end of his shift, before he hung up his apron in the back room and walked out to where Cyrus was sitting, his leg bouncing uncontrollably. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright, time to head out,&rdquo; TJ said, to which Cyrus pouted and shut his laptop, shoving it in his bag.</p><p>&ldquo;I was so close to finishing my last paper, though!&rdquo; he whined, getting up and nearly hopping towards the door.</p><p>TJ chuckled, falling in step with him. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll get to finish it once you get back to your dorm&hellip;which I&rsquo;m just now realizing I don&rsquo;t know where it is. Care to lead the way?&rdquo;</p><p>And lead the way he did. Cyrus had never felt more energetic in his life; was this how athletic people felt? It was incredible. He even went up the stairs without feeling completely winded at the top. All the while, TJ was admiring him with a fond smile on his face. He had just met Cyrus this afternoon, but he felt like he&rsquo;d known him his entire life.</p><p>Once they reached Cyrus&rsquo; dorm, his frantic energy seemed to calm down a little, as he opened the door and stood in the threshold, turning to face TJ.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks for walking me back,&rdquo; he said, and he was a bit more calm than he&rsquo;d been previously, &ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t have to.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ shrugged, putting his hands in his pockets, looking around the room. He saw a small pride flag on one of the tables, but he tried to tell himself it was probably Cyrus&rsquo; roommate&rsquo;s. &ldquo;But I <i>wanted </i>to.&rdquo;</p><p>He wanted to, and Cyrus thought it was so sweet of him. He&rsquo;d only known TJ for the time that they&rsquo;d spent at the coffee shop, but he already felt so close to him, like they were best friends. Without thinking, he stepped forward and wrapped his arms around TJ in a hug.</p><p>TJ didn&rsquo;t really respond for a second; a hug was the last thing he was expecting, and yet, here he was. It was really nice, actually, but by the time TJ had actually started to put his arms around Cyrus, the boy pulled back, mortified, and shut the door.</p><p>TJ waited outside Cyrus&rsquo; door for a minute, waiting to see if maybe he&rsquo;d open it again and talk to him. But after a little while, he left, shaking his head.</p><hr /><p>For the next few days, Cyrus avoided the coffee shop like the plague. Buffy came in to get his orders, and by the time she delivered it to him, it was cold because she&rsquo;d been talking to Marty about their next date.</p><p><i>&ldquo;You guys are going out on a date?&rdquo; Cyrus had exclaimed, his eyes bugging out of his head.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a big deal,&rdquo; she brushed it off, grabbing a piece of her hair and twirling it around between her fingers.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus took a sip of his coffee, smirking. &ldquo;Oh, please, you&rsquo;re so smitten with him and you&rsquo;re excited that he asked you out.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Your words, not mine.&rdquo;</i></p><p>TJ&rsquo;s head snapped up every time the bell rang above the door, but he never saw Cyrus enter. He sighed, pouring the milk into the cup before Marty came up by him and snatched it out of his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;What was that for?&rdquo; TJ snapped, crossing his arms.</p><p>&ldquo;The order is for soy milk, not two percent! Are you trying to actively kill our customers?&rdquo; Marty carded his fingers through his hair, exasperated.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m bad with numbers,&rdquo; TJ mumbled, grabbing a new cup.</p><p>Marty shook his head, taking the cup from TJ&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not like this even when you pull an allnighter. What&rsquo;s going on, dude?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ sighed, leaning back against the counter. He started to explain everything, from the moment that Cyrus walked in, to when they walked back to his dorm together, to when Cyrus hugged him and them pulled away immediately.</p><p>&ldquo;That pretty much brings us up to date,&rdquo; he said plainly, grabbing a rag and wiping down the counter, while Marty stared at him with wide eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Just talk to him, dude,&rdquo; he told him, nudging him a little, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure things are still fine between you two.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ just shrugged, and continued on with his shift like a robot, going through the movements with little effort. The end of his shift came pretty quickly, and he ended up spending some time at the courts shooting hoops, until his phone buzzed.</p><p><b>[Marty: go talk to him or so help me]</b></p><hr /><p>Somehow, TJ found himself going up the stairs in Cyrus&rsquo; dorm complex, and towards his room. He stood outside the door for a little bit, trying to collect his thoughts and think of something to say that would make sense. Tentatively, he rapped his knuckles on the door and waited.</p><p>Soft footsteps were heard from inside, and Cyrus opened the door. All of TJ&rsquo;s planning to say something comprehensible went out the window when he saw him; Cyrus was wearing clothes that were way too big for him, and he had glasses on this time.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, hi,&rdquo; Cyrus said quietly, snapping TJ out of his thoughts.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;hey,&rdquo; he mumbled, clearing his throat, &ldquo;can I talk to you for a second? If you have a class that&rsquo;s fine, I can come back later, or-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;-I have time right now,&rdquo; Cyrus cut in, stepping aside and letting TJ in. He shut the door, his head pounding in his chest, and turned around to see TJ sitting on the ground. Cyrus found that amusing and a little bit cute, but he tried to quell that voice in his head. He took a seat by TJ, pulling his knees into his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;Did I&hellip;do something wrong?&rdquo; TJ asked quietly, looking down at the ground.</p><p>Cyrus immediately turned to look at him, a worried look etched into his face. &ldquo;What? No! What would make you say that?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ shrugged, picking at a fray string in the rug. &ldquo;I&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know, I guess since I haven&rsquo;t seen you much around the coffee shop that&hellip;I did something wrong.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus drew in a breath, gnawing on his lower lip. &ldquo;Right,&rdquo; he mumbled, &ldquo;but&hellip;you didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong. I did.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ looked up from the ground for the first time, unable to meet Cyrus&rsquo; gaze since the other boy was looking up at the ceiling.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus closed his eyes. &ldquo;After you walked me back to my dorm and I just&hellip;hugged you, I wasn&rsquo;t thinking straight&hellip;sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ nearly chuckled at &lsquo;not thinking straight&rsquo;, but kept a solemn face. &ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m, like, mad at you for that?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus shrugged, opening his eyes and looking at TJ. &ldquo;I&hellip;guess not mad, but weirded out because I&rsquo;m-&rdquo;</p><p>He stopped, not letting any more words flow out of his mouth. He surprised himself in that moment; he almost came out to TJ without so much as a second thought to how he might react.</p><p>TJ seemed to pick up on Cyrus&rsquo; discomfort, and shifted a little. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not weirded out, Cyrus,&rdquo; he said, pausing for a beat, &ldquo;I&hellip;I actually liked it.&rdquo;</p><p>Now it was Cyrus&rsquo; turn to be a little surprised, meeting TJ&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;You did?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ nodded, unable to keep looking at Cyrus, so he opted for looking around the room to try and find something to distract himself. The pride flag on the desk caught his attention, and he picked it up, twirling it around in his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;I like this,&rdquo; he said softly, holding it delicately.</p><p>&ldquo;Y-You do?&rdquo; Cyrus stammered, trying to gauge his reaction.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus took this as a good sign, and, feeling a little bold, said &ldquo;It&rsquo;s mine.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ turned to him with a smile so bright that it could eclipse the sun&rsquo;s rays. &ldquo;Really? That&rsquo;s cool. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d have the courage to have one in my room.&rdquo; He breathed out shakily after that; he didn&rsquo;t really plan on coming out today, to Cyrus, but the moment just felt right.</p><p>Cyrus&rsquo; smile softened, opening one of his drawers and rifling around in it. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to make it a big deal, just,&rdquo; he popped his head up, handing TJ a pin, &ldquo;here, take it.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ turned the pin over and over in his hand. It was a rainbow one, with the words &lsquo;you are loved&rsquo; painted on top in black. He smiled, slipping it into his pocket. &ldquo;Thank you, Cyrus. Will I be seeing you around the coffee shop again?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus giggled, throwing his head back; TJ didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d heard such a beautiful laugh. &ldquo;Do the gays flock together?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ chuckled, standing up. &ldquo;In that case, I&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>Things seemed to get a lot better after that day. Cyrus started coming in and ordering coffee during TJ&rsquo;s shifts, and TJ was glad to see that the boy had returned. He&rsquo;d even started wearing his pride pin on his apron. Sure, he was a little nervous to do so for the first few days, but after a few people had complimented him on it, he was much happier to wear it.</p><p>It&rsquo;d been about a month of Cyrus coming in, ordering coffee, spending a little too much time talking to TJ, and then working frantically on his schoolwork.</p><p>It was a relatively quiet Wednesday afternoon, the business of the coffee shop had come to a gentle lull. TJ was steaming some milk for an order, when Marty came up beside him, leaning against the counter.</p><p>&ldquo;So, how long have you been dating him?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ nearly spilled the milk on him, pretty much dropping the cup onto the counter, some of the milk sloshing around and spilling on the counter. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he squeaked, grabbing a rag, and wiping up his mess.</p><p>Marty rolled his eyes, handing TJ a clean rag. &ldquo;You and that kid who keeps coming here?&rdquo; he pointed to Cyrus, who was making gestures at his computer, since he was studying for his ASL test.</p><p>TJ flushed an embarrassing shade of pink, kicking at the ground below him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not&hellip;we&rsquo;re not dating, Marty.&rdquo;</p><p>Marty groaned, sitting up on the counter. &ldquo;Sure, dude. He just happens to be here whenever your shifts are.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s definitely not true,&rdquo; TJ shot back quietly, sneaking a glance over at Cyrus, who was deep in concentration, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s here other times.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never here when I&rsquo;m here working without you,&rdquo; Marty said calmly, shooting TJ a smirk.</p><p>TJ tried to keep his composure on the outside, but on the inside, he was melting. He tried not to read too much into the situation, but he couldn&rsquo;t help himself. He looked over at Cyrus, who smiled up at him and signed &lsquo;hi TJ&rsquo;. It was so cute, he just kind of stared at him until he felt something, or rather someone, slap his arm.</p><p>&ldquo;What the hell was that for?&rdquo; TJ scolded, rubbing his arm where it had just been hit.</p><p>&ldquo;You were staring,&rdquo; Marty pointed out.</p><p>&ldquo;Was not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Was too.&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment, before any more arguing could be done, Buffy walked through the door, smiling brightly at Marty, and taking a seat with Cyrus.</p><p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s Buffy, huh?&rdquo; TJ crossed his arms, leaning back against the counter.</p><p>Now it was Marty&rsquo;s turn to be flustered, turning pink. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you know?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ nudged him. &ldquo;You never smile like that.&rdquo;</p><p>Marty glanced over at Buffy and Cyrus, seeing them deep in conversation, hands moving wildly. Hopping beside TJ, he shook him, effectively spilling ice all over the floor and pointed to Cyrus and Buffy.</p><p>&ldquo;Marty, I love you, but if you don&rsquo;t fucking stop shaking me I will pour hot coffee into your sneakers,&rdquo; TJ threatened, bending down to pick up the ice, Marty helping him a little.</p><p>TJ stood up, letting Marty pick up the rest of the cubes, and ran a hand through his hair. Some of it flopped over his forehead, since he&rsquo;d run out of hair gel and hadn&rsquo;t had a chance to get some more. He grabbed another cup, remaking the iced coffee order.</p><p>Meanwhile, Buffy was sizing him up, as Cyrus sat typing away. &ldquo;So <i>this </i>is the boy you keep talking about, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus huffed beside her, grabbing a few of his papers and sifting through them. &ldquo;Oh hush, he&rsquo;s cute and you know it.&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy shrugged, leaning back in the booth seat. &ldquo;I <i>guess </i>I can see why you like him,&rdquo; she agreed, scrolling through her phone for a while, Cyrus doing work next to her.</p><p>After a little while, TJ came up to where he was sitting, and cleared his throat, setting down a coffee cup.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t order anything,&rdquo; Cyrus said, nudging the cup away, but TJ held it firmly on the table.</p><p>&ldquo;I know. This one&rsquo;s on me. I thought you could use a break from all that strong coffee you drink,&rdquo; he laughed a little, pushing his hair back. Buffy glanced over at Cyrus, who was blushing at the gesture.</p><p>Cyrus eyed the drink with suspicion. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ smirked a little, leaning against the table. &ldquo;My special drink. It&rsquo;s a secret.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do I know you&rsquo;re not trying to poison me?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ&rsquo;s eyes widened a little. &ldquo;Cyrus, really? You think I would poison my favorite person?&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy choked on her spit at that, getting both boys to look at her, but she waved them off, going back to her phone.</p><p>Cyrus was now insanely flustered, and couldn&rsquo;t function as well as he wanted to, so he carefully took the cup into his hands, and took a small sip. It was almost like hot chocolate, but with a hint of vanilla and mint. &ldquo;This is&hellip;really, really good.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ smiled at his work. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you like it. I&rsquo;ll call it the &lsquo;Cyrus Special&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus laughed a little at that, shaking his head. He went back to his studying, talking to Buffy, and answering her questions about TJ. His drink was gone in record time, and he figured he&rsquo;d miss it a little.</p><hr /><p>When Cyrus came in the next day, however, there was a small chalkboard sign on the counter, which said &lsquo;try the Cyrus Special: A Minty Vanilla Wonderland&rsquo;. Still in shock, Cyrus approached the counter, and got TJ&rsquo;s attention.</p><p>&ldquo;You actually made a drink for me?&rdquo; he asked, his voice soft and filled with wonder and fondness.</p><p>TJ returned the smile. &ldquo;I said I would, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll have to order one then,&rdquo; he chuckled, handing him the money and placing the change in the tip jar.</p><p>TJ was busy cleaning the counters in the back, so Marty took care of the order. However, when he saw the name written on the cup, he took the liberty of drawing hearts all around the remaining space, and smiling to himself.</p><p>&ldquo;One Cyrus Special!&rdquo; Marty called out, chuckling a little to himself.</p><p>Cyrus closed his laptop and set it on top of the table, putting his phone in his pocket and heading up to the counter. He picked up his drink, but couldn&rsquo;t help but notice the hearts drawn all over his name. He looked between the cup and Marty, as if to say &lsquo;what the hell&rsquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;You like him, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he asked, giddy with excitement like a child.</p><p>Cyrus&rsquo; grip tightened around the drink, swallowing the lump in his throat. &ldquo;Wh-what?&rdquo;</p><p>Marty sighed, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. &ldquo;TJ! He likes you a lot!&rdquo;</p><p>The world seemed to stop spinning right then and there, as TJ walked out from behind the counter and froze. He could feel the blood rushing from his head, and his chest suddenly felt like it was being crushed. Cyrus was looking between Marty and TJ, a look of confusion and worry on his face.</p><p>Marty fumbled with something to say. &ldquo;Oh, uh, I mean, I mean that he talks to you like-like a friend, and he likes that you, uh, when you come in and talk, or, uh-&rdquo;</p><p>TJ couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore; he hopped over the counter and ran out the door, making a sharp right and taking off. Cyrus took one sip of his coffee, set it down on the counter, and took off running after TJ. It was harder for him, since he wasn&rsquo;t athletically gifted, but TJ was important to him, so no matter how badly his legs burned or his lungs ached, he kept running.</p><p>He eventually saw him, sitting under a cherry tree that was almost ready to bloom. His apron was tossed to the side, and as Cyrus got closer, he could see that he was holding the pride pin in his hand.</p><p>Cyrus came up to him, taking a seat on the grass and taking a few moments to gulp down air, trying to catch his breath. &ldquo;TJ-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;-what?&rdquo; he cut in, sharply. It took Cyrus by surprise, TJ&rsquo;s tone, but he didn&rsquo;t linger on that too long.</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;I just wanted to see if you&rsquo;re okay and-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;-I don&rsquo;t need your pity,&rdquo; he grumbled, holding the pin tighter in his hand.</p><p>Cyrus shrank into himself, trying to press down the lump in his throat. &ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m sorry, TJ, I just&hellip;look, about what Marty said, I-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;-I don&rsquo;t need your pity or your help! Can you just back off?&rdquo; TJ shouted, standing up in a bout of anger, dropping the pin, and stomping on it, effectively breaking it into pieces. It might as well have been Cyrus&rsquo; heart that he stepped on; that&rsquo;s how it felt to Cyrus, at least.</p><p>Cyrus brought a hand up to his mouth, his fingers trembling over his lips. For a split second, TJ looked apologetic, but Cyrus didn&rsquo;t give himself the time to ponder over his facial expressions He just took off running back to his dorm; he was tired, everything ached, and the hot tears spilling down his cheeks made his vision blurry, but he didn&rsquo;t stop until he reached his dorm, slamming the door behind him and collapsing on the bed. He couldn&rsquo;t be thankful enough that his roommate was out.</p><p>Cyrus didn&rsquo;t know how long he spent, clutching the pillow to his chest and crying into it. At some point, he shakily grabbed the pride flag on top of his desk and shoved it underneath his bed. This was the worst he&rsquo;d ever felt in his entire life; TJ hadn&rsquo;t even been in his life for that long, but it felt like he&rsquo;d just lost the most important person to him. After a while of trying not to cry, followed by crying, he took his phone out of his pocket and texted Buffy.</p><p><b>[Me: can you pick up my stuff from the coffee shop? i left it there and i&rsquo;m in my dorm]</b></p><p><b>[Buffy: what? why??]</b></p><p><b>[Me: long story, i don&rsquo;t feel like talking about it right now, please?]</b></p><p><b>[Buffy:&hellip;okay]</b></p><p>He waited in his room, until after around twenty minutes there were footsteps &nbsp;near his door, and a soft &lsquo;thump&rsquo; on his door.</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus? I brought your stuff. I hope you&rsquo;re okay, text me when you can,&rdquo; she said, walking off.</p><p>Cyrus waited five minutes before he opened the door and picked up his things. He saw that she&rsquo;s also brought his coffee, with his name and hearts still on the cup. Taking it in his hand, he took a sip; it was cold now, but it still tasted good. Unfortunately, it still reminded him of TJ, so he ended up throwing it out, before resigning back to his bed for the rest of the day.</p><hr /><p>TJ took the next few days off of work; he couldn&rsquo;t handle being in there for a while, but he couldn&rsquo;t avoid it for too long; he needed the money.</p><p>When he rolled in on Monday morning, and saw Marty behind the counter, casually wiping it down, he made a beeline to him, narrowing his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;You absolute idiot!&rdquo; he shrieked, yanking on his apron.</p><p>Marty glanced up from the counter, raising a brow. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you &lsquo;what&rsquo; me Marty! You told Cyrus that I liked him!&rdquo; he whispered harshly, his gaze flitting around the shop, &ldquo;that was supposed to be a secret.&rdquo;</p><p>Marty groaned, turning on the machines. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not exactly a secret that you two are flirting.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ&rsquo;s eyes widened, crossing his arms. &ldquo;What does <i>that </i>mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you not see the way he looks at you or talks to you? I&rsquo;m like almost a hundred percent sure that he likes you,&rdquo; he told him.</p><p>TJ sighed sadly, washing a cup. &ldquo;Well now there&rsquo;s no chance of that happening.&rdquo;</p><p>Marty didn&rsquo;t look up. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ hesitated, fidgeting with the loose ends of his apron ties. &ldquo;I kind of snapped at him after what happened that day and we haven&rsquo;t spoken since.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have to work things out with him, dude. You know that right?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ nodded. &ldquo;Yeah, I know. I just have no idea what to do.&rdquo;</p><p>Marty grabbed the milk out of the fridge, and started to make himself a coffee, dropping a few bills into the tip jar. &ldquo;I have some idea.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>The following day, early in the afternoon, TJ climbed the stairs to Cyrus&rsquo; dorm, his nerves increasing with each shaky step. Considering how close the two boys had been, TJ knew Cyrus&rsquo; schedule with relative confidence. He stood outside of Cyrus&rsquo; door for a full minute and a half before he knocked, so quietly that he wondered if Cyrus even heard it. After a beat, he heard footsteps from inside, and Cyrus opened the door.</p><p>The first emotion that came over TJ was guilt; Cyrus looked miserable, his hair all over the place, and it looked like he had been wearing the same clothes. He felt upset, mad at himself, but most of all he felt like a terrible human being because Cyrus started to shut the door. Thinking quickly, TJ shoved his foot in the doorway.</p><p>&ldquo;Please, Cyrus, can I talk to you?&rdquo; he pleaded; it sounded almost like a whimper.</p><p>Cyrus just blinked in response, not changing his facial expression or body positioning. TJ had really hurt him; he knew that he tended to forgive fairly easily, but he tried to force himself not to, at least in this instance.</p><p>TJ reached into his pocket, pulling out a new pride pin, and fumbling with it for a moment, before he attached it onto his shirt successfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about what I said and what I did. I was just&hellip;so freaked out by what Marty said&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus leaned against the doorframe. &ldquo;So you decided to snap at me?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ ran a hand through his hair; Cyrus tried his best to not think about how cute he looked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I got scared because&hellip;because he&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus raised a brow, his cold demeanor now replaced with a confused one.</p><p>&ldquo;I like you, Cyrus, okay? Marty saying that&hellip;it scared me, I was worried it would ruin things between us,&rdquo; he said, his voice getting softer as he spoke.</p><p>Cyrus didn&rsquo;t say anything, he just ushered TJ inside, shutting the door behind him. He took a seat on the bed, patting the spot beside him for TJ to come and sit down. TJ nervously sat, wringing his hands in his lap.</p><p>&ldquo;I want you to know that something like this wouldn&rsquo;t change things for the worse between us, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ nodded in response, but he kept his gaze down, not willing himself to look at Cyrus. He didn&rsquo;t want to start crying, not now. Noticing his distress, Cyrus placed a hand on top of TJ&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;But&hellip;I&rsquo;m really glad you said something because I like you too, you know?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ felt the tips of his ears burn at that, and he looked up at Cyrus, a hopeful smile on his face. &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus giggled, nodding. &ldquo;Yes, really!&rdquo;</p><p>TJ felt his whole body relax, and he leaned back on the bed, staring up at the ceiling. &ldquo;So&hellip;would you maybe want to go on a date with me?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus counted to three in his head before he tackled TJ with a hug. &ldquo;Yes, you dork, I would <i>love </i>to go on a date with you!&rdquo;</p><p>They stayed like that for a little bit, before they sat up, hands intertwined. Cyrus reached down and pulled out the pride flag from underneath his bed, waving it around. TJ grinned, holding it with him.</p><hr /><p>Exactly two days and eight hours later, TJ and Cyrus walked into the coffee shop, hand in hand, both excited and thoroughly nervous for their first date. Cyrus ended up ordering the &lsquo;Cyrus Special&rsquo;, while TJ was too excited to order anything.</p><p>They talked quietly until their server brought the order, winking, and making TJ blush like mad. He glanced over to Cyrus, a fond smile on his face. &ldquo;You look unbearably adorable right now.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus grinned, letting a soft laugh escape his through his lips. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me blush like this,&rdquo; he practically whined.</p><p>TJ leaned in a little closer, knocking their knees together. &ldquo;Like what, hmm?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus&rsquo; smile turned into a small smirk, his eyes glimmering. &ldquo;Bet you can&rsquo;t get closer to me?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ laughed softly, before leaning forward and kissing him. Cyrus tastes like vanilla and mint, and it&rsquo;s everything he&rsquo;s ever wanted. No other kiss could compare to this one.</p><p>When they pull away, TJ&rsquo;s eyes stay closed for a little while before fluttering open, and landing on Cyrus, who was nearly on the verge of tears.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, did I do something wrong?&rdquo; TJ worried, placing his hand on top of Cyrus&rsquo;, but then removing it.</p><p>Cyrus shakes his head, choking out a watery laugh. &ldquo;No, no, I&rsquo;m just&hellip;so insanely happy,&rdquo; he admitted, after which TJ pulled him close, wrapping his arms around Cyrus and enjoying the moment. He could confidently say this was the best first date ever.</p><hr /><p>The following Monday, Cyrus came in and greeted TJ with a kiss on the cheek, to which Marty reacted as if TJ had just sprouted a second head.</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip;&rdquo; Marty trailed.</p><p>TJ chuckled, shrugging. &ldquo;Yes, dumbass, we&rsquo;re dating.&rdquo;</p><p>Marty broke out into a grin, shoving TJ a little and slapping his arm over and over. &ldquo;Dude, finally! Who confessed first?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p><p>Marty&rsquo;s face dropped at that, and Buffy popped out of seemingly nowhere (it wasn&rsquo;t nowhere, it was actually from behind the counter).</p><p>&ldquo;Ha! I told you! You owe me the drink of my choice,&rdquo; she stated victoriously.</p><p>&ldquo;You <i>bet </i>on us?&rdquo; TJ asked incredulously.</p><p>Buffy chuckled, nodding. &ldquo;At least you guys got your heads out of your asses and confessed to each other.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ looked over at Cyrus, who was sitting and working on his laptop, with a fond smile. &ldquo;Yeah. At least that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So, what&rsquo;ll it be?&rdquo; Marty asked, grabbing a cup and a pen.</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm, I think I want my own drink,&rdquo; she decided, &ldquo;the &lsquo;Buffy Blitz&rsquo;, if you will. A latte with two pumps of caramel, and three of white chocolate, topped with whipped cream and shaved chocolate.&rdquo;</p><p>Marty scribbled away on the cup. &ldquo;Coming right up, your highness.&rdquo;</p><p>After he finished the order, they decided to close up a little early, and all four of them sat together at a table for a double date. It was one of their favorite experiences to date.</p><hr /><p>When TJ graduated from college, he ended up becoming the school psychologist for Jefferson Middle School and he opened a coffee shop on the side, which he and his sister Amber co-owned.</p><p>Cyrus went on to study during his graduate years, and would always come by to grab his coffee, which TJ would always have a coffee ready for him. He would still wear the pride pin that he had kept all these years, and there was even a small pride flag around the tip jar.</p><p>The menu was made up of the classic drinks, but there were also specialty drinks, which were all named after his friends. Cyrus sometimes got a different order, but the one that TJ named after him would forever be his favorite.</p><p>One day, after TJ&rsquo;s shift, he and Cyrus took the long way back to Cyrus&rsquo; apartment, taking in the beautiful buds that were soon going to bloom into flowers, and admiring the way the sun fell through the leaves. Even if it was the long way back, it still felt too short, too soon to part, at least to TJ. Cyrus seemed to pick up on this, giving him a soft smile and taking his hand in his own.</p><p>&ldquo;Come in, stay for a little while,&rdquo; Cyrus offered.</p><p>TJ shrugged, kicking at the ground. &ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s okay, I&rsquo;ll have to leave anyways.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus waited a beat, taking a small step towards TJ. &ldquo;I mean, you could always move in with me.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ looked up at him so fast he swore he heard his neck snap. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus giggled, tugging him inside. &ldquo;Look, I know it&rsquo;s kind of small and cramped but&hellip;we could make it work. What do you say?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ could barely believe what he was hearing. He stared for a few moments, before wrapping his arms around Cyrus and spinning him around. &ldquo;Yes, oh my gosh, I&rsquo;d love to!&rdquo;</p><p>Peals of laughter filled the room, the two boys happier than ever before.</p><p>TJ put him down, his smile softening. &ldquo;You know, I told myself I wouldn&rsquo;t move in with someone unless I was getting married.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus raised his brows, smirking. &ldquo;Well, well, well. Might just have to propose one of these days then, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ laughed a little, pressing a kiss to Cyrus&rsquo; temple and wrapping an arm around him. &ldquo;Okay, sure, whatever you say, Cy.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>Two months later, when they were both sitting under the covers, watching a movie, Cyrus turned to TJ and said, &ldquo;We should get married.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ just looked at him, pausing the movie. &ldquo;Cyrus?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I mean, only if you want to, you know,&rdquo; Cyrus shrugged, looking up into his eyes, &ldquo;but&hellip;if you do, that&rsquo;d be cool.&rdquo;</p><p>That night, Cyrus saw what was quite possibly the most beautiful smile on TJ&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one else I&rsquo;d rather be with,&rdquo; he smiled, leaning in for a kiss. Cyrus seemed to always taste like vanilla and mint, and if that&rsquo;s what it would be like for the rest of their lives, that was just okay with him.</p><p>Cyrus pulled back from the kiss, his eyes still closed, and leaned on TJ&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;I love you, TJ.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ smiled at the boy in his arms. He remembered when they had barely just met; TJ had no idea how important Cyrus would become to him. He couldn&rsquo;t imagine his life without the brunet.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too, Cy.&rdquo;</p></p>",

Keep up the good work!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>TJ walked out of the gym, wiping his sweat with the hem of his shirt. He quickly hopped into the shower and turned the water on, sighing softly. It was nice, just sitting here and letting the water hit him, but he had a shift soon, so he needed to get going. Drying himself off with a towel and changing into his clothes, he headed out the door, nearly running down the street.</p>\n<p>Pushing open the door to the cafe, he was reminded of why he took this job in the first place. There was really nothing better than the smell of coffee to make him feel happy. He slipped on his apron and his nametag, hopping behind the counter and prepping the machines.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh good, you&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; Marty said, untying his apron and putting his elbows on the counter. He seemed exceptionally mopey today.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re just so thankful I&rsquo;m here to handle our-&rdquo; he looked out into the store, counting the customers with exaggeration, &ldquo;three customers, one of which already has a coffee?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Marty rolled his eyes, nudging TJ&rsquo;s shoulder and sighing loudly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just glad I have someone to talk to.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>TJ chuckled, running his hands along the coffee machine. &ldquo;Ah, yes. Your little flirty friend isn&rsquo;t here to keep you company.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;First of all, her name&rsquo;s Buffy,&rdquo; he started with an exasperated tone, &ldquo;and second of all, she&rsquo;s not my flirty friend. She&rsquo;s just my friend.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>TJ snorted. &ldquo;Says the guy who continuously writes pick-up lines on her orders.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Marty spotted a few people coming in, and started grabbing a couple of cups, without thinking. &ldquo;When are you going to stop bugging me about my love life and start focusing on yours?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;When I find a cute boy, who also likes cute boys,&rdquo; TJ commented, retying his apron.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, you think you&rsquo;re cute, Kippen?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Very.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Marty shook his head, walking towards the exit. &ldquo;See you later.&rdquo;</p>\n</p>",

You were telling a story about how your cousin drank his milkshake in 4 minutes flat, only to realize he was lactose intolerant. He never went out to eat with you again because you laughed at him for weeks. You laughed so hard telling the story that you started crying, but your eyes were lit up with joy.</p><p>When you came out to me in your basement. I made a joke about how girls would love a ping pong champion. You said you hoped the guys did too. The guys most certainly do. I was stunned into silence because I realized you wouldn&rsquo;t find it so weird that I thought your eyes were pretty.</p><p>That time we went on the Ferris wheel at Adrenaline City. You wouldn&rsquo;t look away from the spinning wheel, but I made you have a staring contest with me. You looked like you were about to cry until Marty spun the wheel and you screeched with your head in your hands.</p><p>When I had dinner at your house for your dad&rsquo;s birthday. I was helping serve cake when you said I had gotten frosting on my nose. You wiped it off with a napkin because I &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t getting the blue off.&rdquo; The blue didn&rsquo;t even come off after.</p><p>When I was getting you do do the high jump into the foam pit at Bouncy Castle Land. Andi and Buffy had always let you sit out, but I made you count to 10 with me before you let me push you off the platform.</p><p>When my cat had kittens and you were holding one, but it sneezed and you look at me smiling like a goof. I thought I could look at you smiling like a goof forever.</p><p>That time we were studying for my math test and you laughed at the drawing of my cat. When you laugh you get a sparkle in your eye. I got \u00a0B+ on that math test and you took me to the Spoon to celebrate.</p><p>When we were playing the second championship game and I looked over at you during the last timeout. Your smile made me want to win the game to make you proud even though you would be proud either way.</p><p>When Andi was thinking about going to New York for an art school, so you went to the swings to think about it. I told you that you were allowed to be upset about it because she was your best friend and you would miss her more if you were here instead of with her. Andi decided not to go.</p><p>When you got a brain freeze from eating a snow cone too fast at the fair. </p><p>9 times I almost held your hand. \u00a0Mostly times I missed my chance to.</p><p>When we went on that roller coaster and you said you couldn&rsquo;t feel your hands. I thought about it for a long time, but then we were upside down and I missed my chance.</p><p>When I watched your dance final and you were shaking when you finished, because when I&rsquo;m shaking people holding my hands make me feel better but you were being hugged by Buffy before I got the nerve to.</p><p>When you came out to Amber at the Spoon, because she said she was frosting everything rainbow for pride month and you said you would definitely but a piece of cake for that, and she asked if you were LGBT+ and you paused and said you were gay. I didn&rsquo;t want to reach over the table so I didn&rsquo;t hold your hand.</p><p>When we were both laying on the couch but we couldn&rsquo;t reach the remote, so we both reached out to get it. I ended up falling off the couch.</p><p>When my cat scratched you and I helped you clean your hand, and I did technically hold your hand but I almost really held your hand.</p><p>When Andi was up for an art award and they were announcing winners. I started clapping to snap you out of peeling your fingernails. She didn&rsquo;t win, but she got 2nd place.</p><p>When we were having a sleepover and you turned over on the air mattress just to say &ldquo;TJ, I LOVE dinosaurs.&rdquo; You started showing me shadow puppet dinosaurs, but you were too tired to do it right.</p><p>At Andi&rsquo;s slumber party, you were doing everyone&rsquo;s nails with Amber, and you painted mine yellow. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re like my lemon boy, Teej. Or a sour-patch kid. Because you&rsquo;re sweet now,&rdquo; you said.</p><p>When Andi was upset about her parents not getting married and Buffy was hanging out with Marty again, you told me that you were afraid it was straining your relationship with them. I told you that if you could survive Celia becoming Ce-Ce and Buffy moving you could survive some change.</p><p>8 times I almost kissed you.</p><p>When we were at the pool and you did the big water slide, and you were so excited that you choked on the water. You laughed so hard that you had to get out of the pool.</p><p>When we met Amber&rsquo;s dog for the first time, and you thought he was the cutest thing in the world.</p><p>When we got churros at the fair. You got cinnamon on your nose and I still have no idea how.</p><p>When we had that pillow fight and you somehow got a hold of every pillow and it was like you had 3 pairs of nun-chucks.</p><p>When we were at the drive-in and you were holding all of the candy because Jonah had a broken arm. He said you wouldn&rsquo;t let him hold anything, but you said his arm was hurting. It was probably both.</p><p>That time at the lake when I jumped in, and you didn&rsquo;t want to jump in after me so you tried just walking into the lake but you slipped on the mud.</p><p>When we were swimming for Buffy&rsquo;s birthday party, Marty and Jonah flipped your floatie over. You complained about your hair the whole day, but I thought it looked better.</p><p>When you saw the shooting star on July 4th. Right after you saw it the fireworks started and the sound scared you.</p><p>7 times I almost told someone I liked you.</p><p>Buffy asked me after my first game of the season if I liked you, and I almost said yes. I said I didn&rsquo;t know.</p><p>My mom asked me why I had become so much happier lately. I said I was just having fun hanging out with you and everyone. Part of it was me being happy about coming out, but it was also being around you that made me so happy.</p><p>Jonah asked me how long we had been dating. He really thought we&rsquo;d been dating for months.</p><p>I was paying for a Queen record when Bowie asked about the drawings on my hand. He asked me who drew it and when I said that you drew it, he said, &ldquo;You two are pretty close, huh?&rdquo; I just smiled and said yeah.</p><p>My cousins came over for Christmas. Addie is 8 years old and when she saw me texting you she said, &ldquo;Why are you smiling so much? My mamma says people only smile that much when they&rsquo;re in love!&rdquo; I thought it was really funny that she pointed it out before Buffy or Amber.</p><p>Jonah, Marty, and I were watching Love, Simon and they asked why I knew all of the emails by heart. It was nice to think of having a love story like that, even if it wasn&rsquo;t with you.</p><p>I almost told Amber&rsquo;s dog once, but Andi walked in before I said it. </p><p>6 times I did hold your hand.</p><p>When you were over and my parents started fighting while we played Mortal Kombat. I didn&rsquo;t want to feel scared like I always feel when they fight, even though I had never done it when they fought before.</p><p>When I came out to my dad. Or before, I guess. It made it easier having you there because I had someone there for me if my dad wasn&rsquo;t.</p><p>When you had a sleepover and we tried to watch all of Supernatural in one night. I fell asleep after a few episodes, but the first scene always makes me nervous.</p><p>When I was going into math class for the last test of the semester. You had worked with me the most and you believing that I could pass made me really want to pass the test.</p><p>When we listened to Paris by Sabrina Carpenter for the first time. It was more of me grabbing your hand and spinning you around to the music, but it counts. </p><p>When you brought me the blueberry macadamia muffin. That was one of the best muffins I&rsquo;ve ever had, by the way.</p><p>5 times I almost called you at 2 am.</p><p>When my parents were fighting and I wanted to distract myself, but I ended up watching YouTube.</p><p>When Khalid announced his tour and I saw the post. You actually ended up calling me first.</p><p>When my cat threw up on my bed. I was really stressed but I got worried about the cat and told my mom instead.</p><p>After you dislocated your thumb when I tried to teach you how to play basketball. I was so worried that I couldn&rsquo;t sleep, but your mom posted on Facebook that you were fine so I let it be.</p><p>When I realized the song stuck in my head was Electric Love by B\u00d8RNS. Then I realized you were probably asleep, so I didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>4 times I did call you at 2 am.</p><p>When my dad told my mom that I was gay. I thought he was cool with it, but while they were fighting he said, &ldquo;So YOU can have our abomination of a son.&rdquo; My parent decided to get a divorce later that week. I probably called you every week because I couldn&rsquo;t handle it.</p><p>When I realized another song that was stuck in my head was Maneater by Nelly Furtado. You didn&rsquo;t know what song I was talking about until I sang the &ldquo;you wish you never met her at all&rdquo; part.</p><p>When I had that nightmare where a clown came and attacked the whole town but you had an alliance with him but he was set on killing me so you died defending me then the clown died because he wasn&rsquo;t allowed to kill you.</p><p>When you texted me saying you hated crying at 2 am. You were crying about your stepdad making a homophobic joke. I said that he probably didn&rsquo;t mean it, and would stop once he realized he was directly hurting you. It still wasn&rsquo;t okay, though.</p><p>3 times I thought I had lost you.</p><p>When Reed brought that gun. I know I&rsquo;ve said it dozens of times, but I didn&rsquo;t think he would bring it while you were there.</p><p>When your dad was thinking about moving to Texas and you got really excited, but your mom said she didn&rsquo;t want to give up custody so he stayed. I wanted you to be happy, but I also wanted to be with you forever and I wouldn&rsquo;t really want to be in Texas for months or years on end.</p><p>When Kira outed me to the school, and she looked at you when she said I was really obvious about it. I thought you weren&rsquo;t ready to come out in any way at school, but you said that our friendship was worth more than avoiding humiliation.</p><p>2 times I almost confessed.</p><p>That day when we couldn&rsquo;t reach the remote from the couch. Me falling off the couch made me forget about it, though.</p><p>When I came out to you. I was crying and you were almost crying and I have no idea why I was so terrified.</p><p>1 time I did.</p><p>Right now. I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s taken me so long, but with enough reassurance from Jonah and Andi, I&rsquo;m writing this letter to you right now. I adore you, Cy. I want to be around you all the time. I would really, really like to kiss you. I know you might not feel the same, but I also know our friendship would survive a crush. I don&rsquo;t like keeping secrets from you. The last one is this: I like you. I like you more than I&rsquo;ve ever liked anyone. And I had a teddy bear named Blueberry for 12 years until Reed blew it up. That&rsquo;s all.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Love, TJ. aka Tyler James.</p>",

I didn\u2019t want to feel scared like I always feel when they fight, even though I had never done it when they fought before.</p><p>When I came out to my dad. Or before, I guess. It made it easier having you there because I had someone there for me if my dad wasn\u2019t.</p><p>When you had a sleepover and we tried to watch all of Supernatural in one night. I fell asleep after a few episodes, but the first scene always makes me nervous.</p><p>When I was going into math class for the last test of the semester. You had worked with me the most and you believing that I could pass made me really want to pass the test.</p><p>When we listened to Paris by Sabrina Carpenter for the first time. It was more of me grabbing your hand and spinning you around to the music, but it counts. </p><p>When you brought me the blueberry macadamia muffin. That was one of the best muffins I\u2019ve ever had, by the way.</p><p>5 times I almost called you at 2 am.</p><p>When my parents were fighting and I wanted to distract myself, but I ended up watching YouTube.</p><p>When Khalid announced his tour and I saw the post. You actually ended up calling me first.</p><p>When my cat threw up on my bed. I was really stressed but I got worried about the cat and told my mom instead.</p><p>After you dislocated your thumb when I tried to teach you how to play basketball. I was so worried that I couldn\u2019t sleep, but your mom posted on Facebook that you were fine so I let it be.</p><p>When I realized the song stuck in my head was Electric Love by B\u00d8RNS. Then I realized you were probably asleep, so I didn\u2019t.</p><p>4 times I did call you at 2 am.</p><p>When my dad told my mom that I was gay. I thought he was cool with it, but while they were fighting he said, \u201cSo YOU can have our abomination of a son.\u201d My parent decided to get a divorce later that week. I probably called you every week because I couldn\u2019t handle it.</p><p>When I realized another song that was stuck in my head was Maneater by Nelly Furtado. You didn\u2019t know what song I was talking about until I sang the \u201cyou wish you never met her at all\u201d part.</p><p>When I had that nightmare where a clown came and attacked the whole town but you had an alliance with him but he was set on killing me so you died defending me then the clown died because he wasn\u2019t allowed to kill you.</p><p>When you texted me saying you hated crying at 2 am. You were crying about your stepdad making a homophobic joke. I said that he probably didn\u2019t mean it, and would stop once he realized he was directly hurting you. It still wasn\u2019t okay, though.</p><p>3 times I thought I had lost you.</p><p>When Reed brought that gun. I know I\u2019ve said it dozens of times, but I didn\u2019t think he would bring it while you were there.</p><p>When your dad was thinking about moving to Texas and you got really excited, but your mom said she didn\u2019t want to give up custody so he stayed. I wanted you to be happy, but I also wanted to be with you forever and I wouldn\u2019t really want to be in Texas for months or years on end.</p><p>When Kira outed me to the school, and she looked at you when she said I was really obvious about it. I thought you weren\u2019t ready to come out in any way at school, but you said that our friendship was worth more than avoiding humiliation.</p><p>2 times I almost confessed.</p><p>That day when we couldn\u2019t reach the remote from the couch. Me falling off the couch made me forget about it, though.</p><p>When I came out to you. I was crying and you were almost crying and I have no idea why I was so terrified.</p><p>1 time I did.</p><p>Right now. I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s taken me so long, but with enough reassurance from Jonah and Andi, I\u2019m writing this letter to you right now. I adore you, Cy. I want to be around you all the time. I would really, really like to kiss you. I know you might not feel the same, but I also know our friendship would survive a crush. I don\u2019t like keeping secrets from you. The last one is this: I like you. I like you more than I\u2019ve ever liked anyone. And I had a teddy bear named Blueberry for 12 years until Reed blew it up. That\u2019s all.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Love, TJ. aka Tyler James.</p></p>",

You were telling a story about how your cousin drank his milkshake in 4 minutes flat, only to realize he was lactose intolerant. He never went out to eat with you again because you laughed at him for weeks. You laughed so hard telling the story that you started crying, but your eyes were lit up with joy.</p><p>When you came out to me in your basement. I made a joke about how girls would love a ping pong champion. You said you hoped the guys did too. The guys most certainly do. I was stunned into silence because I realized you wouldn\u2019t find it so weird that I thought your eyes were pretty.</p><p>That time we went on the Ferris wheel at Adrenaline City. You wouldn\u2019t look away from the spinning wheel, but I made you have a staring contest with me. You looked like you were about to cry until Marty spun the wheel and you screeched with your head in your hands.</p><p>When I had dinner at your house for your dad\u2019s birthday. I was helping serve cake when you said I had gotten frosting on my nose. You wiped it off with a napkin because I \u201cwasn\u2019t getting the blue off.\u201d The blue didn\u2019t even come off after.</p><p>When I was getting you do do the high jump into the foam pit at Bouncy Castle Land. Andi and Buffy had always let you sit out, but I made you count to 10 with me before you let me push you off the platform.</p><p>When my cat had kittens and you were holding one, but it sneezed and you look at me smiling like a goof. I thought I could look at you smiling like a goof forever.</p><p>That time we were studying for my math test and you laughed at the drawing of my cat. When you laugh you get a sparkle in your eye. I got \u00a0B+ on that math test and you took me to the Spoon to celebrate.</p><p>When we were playing the second championship game and I looked over at you during the last timeout. Your smile made me want to win the game to make you proud even though you would be proud either way.</p><p>When Andi was thinking about going to New York for an art school, so you went to the swings to think about it. I told you that you were allowed to be upset about it because she was your best friend and you would miss her more if you were here instead of with her. Andi decided not to go.</p><p>When you got a brain freeze from eating a snow cone too fast at the fair. </p><p>9 times I almost held your hand. \u00a0Mostly times I missed my chance to.</p><p>When we went on that roller coaster and you said you couldn\u2019t feel your hands. I thought about it for a long time, but then we were upside down and I missed my chance.</p><p>When I watched your dance final and you were shaking when you finished, because when I\u2019m shaking people holding my hands make me feel better but you were being hugged by Buffy before I got the nerve to.</p><p>When you came out to Amber at the Spoon, because she said she was frosting everything rainbow for pride month and you said you would definitely but a piece of cake for that, and she asked if you were LGBT+ and you paused and said you were gay. I didn\u2019t want to reach over the table so I didn\u2019t hold your hand.</p><p>When we were both laying on the couch but we couldn\u2019t reach the remote, so we both reached out to get it. I ended up falling off the couch.</p><p>When my cat scratched you and I helped you clean your hand, and I did technically hold your hand but I almost really held your hand.</p><p>When Andi was up for an art award and they were announcing winners. I started clapping to snap you out of peeling your fingernails. She didn\u2019t win, but she got 2nd place.</p><p>When we were having a sleepover and you turned over on the air mattress just to say \u201cTJ, I LOVE dinosaurs.\u201d You started showing me shadow puppet dinosaurs, but you were too tired to do it right.</p><p>At Andi\u2019s slumber party, you were doing everyone\u2019s nails with Amber, and you painted mine yellow. \u201cYou\u2019re like my lemon boy, Teej. Or a sour-patch kid. Because you\u2019re sweet now,\u201d you said.</p><p>When Andi was upset about her parents not getting married and Buffy was hanging out with Marty again, you told me that you were afraid it was straining your relationship with them. I told you that if you could survive Celia becoming Ce-Ce and Buffy moving you could survive some change.</p><p>8 times I almost kissed you.</p><p>When we were at the pool and you did the big water slide, and you were so excited that you choked on the water. You laughed so hard that you had to get out of the pool.</p><p>When we met Amber\u2019s dog for the first time, and you thought he was the cutest thing in the world.</p><p>When we got churros at the fair. You got cinnamon on your nose and I still have no idea how.</p><p>When we had that pillow fight and you somehow got a hold of every pillow and it was like you had 3 pairs of nun-chucks.</p><p>When we were at the drive-in and you were holding all of the candy because Jonah had a broken arm. He said you wouldn\u2019t let him hold anything, but you said his arm was hurting. It was probably both.</p><p>That time at the lake when I jumped in, and you didn\u2019t want to jump in after me so you tried just walking into the lake but you slipped on the mud.</p><p>When we were swimming for Buffy\u2019s birthday party, Marty and Jonah flipped your floatie over. You complained about your hair the whole day, but I thought it looked better.</p><p>When you saw the shooting star on July 4th. Right after you saw it the fireworks started and the sound scared you.</p><p>7 times I almost told someone I liked you.</p><p>Buffy asked me after my first game of the season if I liked you, and I almost said yes. I said I didn\u2019t know.</p><p>My mom asked me why I had become so much happier lately. I said I was just having fun hanging out with you and everyone. Part of it was me being happy about coming out, but it was also being around you that made me so happy.</p><p>Jonah asked me how long we had been dating. He really thought we\u2019d been dating for months.</p><p>I was paying for a Queen record when Bowie asked about the drawings on my hand. He asked me who drew it and when I said that you drew it, he said, \u201cYou two are pretty close, huh?\u201d I just smiled and said yeah.</p><p>My cousins came over for Christmas. Addie is 8 years old and when she saw me texting you she said, \u201cWhy are you smiling so much? My mamma says people only smile that much when they\u2019re in love!\u201d I thought it was really funny that she pointed it out before Buffy or Amber.</p><p>Jonah, Marty, and I were watching Love, Simon and they asked why I knew all of the emails by heart.

That was one of the best muffins I&rsquo;ve ever had, by the way.</p><p>5 times I almost called you at 2 am.</p><p>When my parents were fighting and I wanted to distract myself, but I ended up watching YouTube.</p><p>When Khalid announced his tour and I saw the post. You actually ended up calling me first.</p><p>When my cat threw up on my bed. I was really stressed but I got worried about the cat and told my mom instead.</p><p>After you dislocated your thumb when I tried to teach you how to play basketball. I was so worried that I couldn&rsquo;t sleep, but your mom posted on Facebook that you were fine so I let it be.</p><p>When I realized the song stuck in my head was Electric Love by B&Oslash;RNS. Then I realized you were probably asleep, so I didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>4 times I did call you at 2 am.</p><p>When my dad told my mom that I was gay. I thought he was cool with it, but while they were fighting he said, &ldquo;So YOU can have our abomination of a son.&rdquo; My parent decided to get a divorce later that week. I probably called you every week because I couldn&rsquo;t handle it.</p><p>When I realized another song that was stuck in my head was Maneater by Nelly Furtado. You didn&rsquo;t know what song I was talking about until I sang the &ldquo;you wish you never met her at all&rdquo; part.</p><p>When I had that nightmare where a clown came and attacked the whole town but you had an alliance with him but he was set on killing me so you died defending me then the clown died because he wasn&rsquo;t allowed to kill you.</p><p>When you texted me saying you hated crying at 2 am. You were crying about your stepdad making a homophobic joke. I said that he probably didn&rsquo;t mean it, and would stop once he realized he was directly hurting you. It still wasn&rsquo;t okay, though.</p><p>3 times I thought I had lost you.</p><p>When Reed brought that gun. I know I&rsquo;ve said it dozens of times, but I didn&rsquo;t think he would bring it while you were there.</p><p>When your dad was thinking about moving to Texas and you got really excited, but your mom said she didn&rsquo;t want to give up custody so he stayed. I wanted you to be happy, but I also wanted to be with you forever and I wouldn&rsquo;t really want to be in Texas for months or years on end.</p><p>When Kira outed me to the school, and she looked at you when she said I was really obvious about it. I thought you weren&rsquo;t ready to come out in any way at school, but you said that our friendship was worth more than avoiding humiliation.</p><p>2 times I almost confessed.</p><p>That day when we couldn&rsquo;t reach the remote from the couch. Me falling off the couch made me forget about it, though.</p><p>When I came out to you. I was crying and you were almost crying and I have no idea why I was so terrified.</p><p>1 time I did.</p><p>Right now. I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s taken me so long, but with enough reassurance from Jonah and Andi, I&rsquo;m writing this letter to you right now. I adore you, Cy. I want to be around you all the time. I would really, really like to kiss you. I know you might not feel the same, but I also know our friendship would survive a crush. I don&rsquo;t like keeping secrets from you. The last one is this: I like you. I like you more than I&rsquo;ve ever liked anyone. And I had a teddy bear named Blueberry for 12 years until Reed blew it up. That&rsquo;s all.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Love, TJ. aka Tyler James.</p></p>",
