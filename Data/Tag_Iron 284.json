        "body": "<p>okay so i know that this is probably not true but hear me out. Harley from Iron Man 3 is Harry Osborn.</p><p>There are a lot of things that would probably get in the way of this but basically my theory is that Harley Keener\u2019s real name is Harley/ Harry Osborn, his father left him 6 years ago because he couldn\u2019t deal with the fact that his first wife died from giving birth to Harley and couldn\u2019t look at Harley\u2019s face without seeing her\u2019s. Harley took on his stepmoms last name, though he doesn\u2019t know that she\u2019s not his real mom. \u00a0Like he said in Iron Man 3, his father left 6 years ago, so if he was about 10 or 11 in that movie he would have been 4 or 5 when this happened. It would have been fairly easy to forget about his real mother if his dad never talked about her and his stepmother acted as if he was her own son after his dad left.</p><p>My theory for the next Avengers movie regarding Harley is that when Tony sees him again Harley will bring up his dad, Norman Osborn, and how they reconnected again.
