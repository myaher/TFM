He came bolting at you, full speed without a care in the world for the human being on the opposing end of his force. You were left shocked, hitting the wall behind you with your back and only just managing to force out a small, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYeah- shit, I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>And it was only when he dusted himself off that you realised you were talking to the prince, famed for being brash and rude, a young man with only one goal in his mind- to prove himself and in doing so, have everyone under his thumb. All you could think of was that it was lucky he ran into you in an alleyway and not in public, in full view. You pinched the edge of your skirt in a weak curtsy, feeling the colour drain from you and your stomach twist.</p><p><br/></p><p>In parallel with all his public statements, he gave you no apology but instead a mere justification. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI was trying to get away from the ball-\u201c</p><p><br/></p><p>You\u2019d heard about that. Only nobles tended to go. It was always a fantasy in the back of your mind to sneak in but you never had the time, skills or effort to pull it off. Plus there was always the risk of getting arrested which would prevent you from supporting your family. You weren\u2019t exactly wealthy.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThe old hag\u2019s trying to get me to marry someone. Says she\u2019ll retire in a few months whether I like it or not. Lazy woman.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>You weren\u2019t sure whether to nod at that, would it count as treason if you did? </p><p><br/></p><p>Luckily, he seemed to bring himself out of it. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cAnyway. Take me somewhere I can lay low. No people. Now.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Hesitantly nodding, you motioned for him for follow you through the alley. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWould my bedroom be okay?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cSure, whatever- just hurry the hell up before someone else comes up this alleyway.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>You\u2019d probably be able to silently sneak into your bedroom from the back of the building without alerting anyone. Hopefully you had left your window open.</p><p><br/></p><p>As it turned out, you had and the two of you were able to climb in with the help of a few crates. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThis is it? It\u2019s small. Suppose we can\u2019t all live in castles.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Once you were in the room, the prince picked up trinkets and quizzed you about them. It was probably one of the most intimidating conversations you\u2019d ever had, always feeling like you were teetering on the edge of saying something wrong given his unamused grunts and mocking chuckles- even when he was asking for simple information like your name and upbringing. But gradually, you could see that he didn\u2019t mean to be rude, he just\u2026 was.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving now,\u201d he announced after roughly two hours. \u201cWatch where you\u2019re going next time.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>With gritted teeth you repressed an insult and replied, \u201cYes, my prince. Goodbye.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>He slid out of the window and vanished into the night.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>The second time Bakugo ran into you, it could of been accidental. He came into your family\u2019s shop, of which you were shopkeeping. His clothes were a far cry from the finery you had originally seen him wear, hair wilder- still recognisable, but you supposed that he might of taken the long route to the store to avoid most of the town if he truly didn\u2019t want people seeing him.</p><p><br/></p><p>You supposed that either Bakugo managed to distinguish your shop out of the street- somehow managing to remember it\u2019s location even after only seeing the dark back alley- or he couldof stumbled upon it by pure accident. He seemed to recognise you, smirked at you, then proceeded to ask for help with various items in the store, only picking up a select few to actually buy. And they were silly little things- sweets and pouches of herbs and small puzzles- perhaps he was going to give them to someone? Or maybe he just wanted them for himself, there wasn\u2019t anything wrong with that but you knew he could afford better.</p><p><br/></p><p>For a good fifteen minutes, you had to run after him and assist him with anything he desired, all the while his hand rested somewhere on your body- dragging you by the wrist or resting on the small of your back.</p><p><br/></p><p>And at long last, he finally decided to complete his purchase.</p><p><br/></p><p>Bakugo\u2019s fingers drummed on the counter as he waited for you to count out the correct amount of change. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty good at this whole\u2026 helping thing. Ever considered a job in the castle?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cNo, no I haven\u2019t, my prince.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cShit, that\u2019s a shame. You know, the offer\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep it in mind. Thank you.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Once he left, you went to clean up but immediately found yourself face to face with your mother, her hands on your shoulders and face lit up with excitement.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cA job at the castle! You know, I bet it would pay a lot better than you could ever get working here.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>The pay would be good, you already knew that. It\u2019s just that you weren\u2019t sure if you could actually deal with a job like that- deal with the Bakugos. You\u2019d hate to spend the rest of your life constantly on edge.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d You said, hoping to let her down easy. \u201cI want to be able to stay and support you-\u201c</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cIf it bothers you so much, you could always send money back.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI guess, but\u2026\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cBut you want to stay here?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYes. I do.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Your mother gave you a wry smile and a, \u201cWell, that\u2019s alright too\u201d and left you standing in the middle of the small store. With some hesitation, you brought yourself to get back behind the counter.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p><br/></p><p>The third time Bakugo ran into you seemed a little too coincidental for your liking.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cOi, (Y/N)!\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>You were tending to your herb garden that was really a secluded, smaller plot of a shared community garden. It was one of your safe havens that you visited frequently, so it seemed a little off that the prince would suddenly be visiting, especially because he went so far into the garden that he was able to find you. Leaning against the back of a shed, he beckoned you over to join him, which you did. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI was looking for the hag\u2019s old garden that she kept as a kid. Any particularly overrun areas in this place?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>His piercing red eyes were locked onto yours, watching as you faltered and pointed over to a plot that had a shed and a flower pots with only weeds growing. He grabbed your wrist and tugged you along, unlocking the shed and doing some rummaging until he found a bag of seeds that he stuffed into his pocket. Then, he turned to face you.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cConsidered that job in the castle yet?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>You swallowed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t think I want to.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s light work with good pay. If you want to feel like you\u2019re really earning your keep I could find something harder- but I think you\u2019d be an idiot to turn this down.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my prince. I want to stay with my family.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>His demeanour didn\u2019t change and he continued to be persistent.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, just \u201cKatsuki\u201d is fine. How about this: come to the castle with me, see what it\u2019s like, maybe I can convince you to stay?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>The only thing you were able to do was shake your head.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>You realised his grasp on your wrist was back, tightening and making your eyes widen in fear as he only gazed into them with anger, never relenting, never leaving.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cFuck, fine! I\u2019ll tell it to you straight. Be my wife. Come home with me. Get married- to me. I\u2019ll make sure you get everything you could ever want.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Eventually, he released your wrist and his expression softened, he looked at the ground in what almost appeared to be shame. This did nothing to ease the panic coursing through your body.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s okay with you. You don\u2019t have to.\u201d He muttered begrudgingly. You assumed that his mother probably taught him this one crucial piece of etiquette.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m, I\u2019m <i>really</i> sorry, Katsuki. I have family and friends here and I\u2019m not even a noble. Plus, I-\u201c</p><p><br/></p><p>You had to steel yourself.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really think you\u2019re my type. But we can be friends!\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>You supposed that was the politest way to put, \u201cI don\u2019t want to marry someone who drags me everywhere and constantly demands things from me\u201d.</p><p><br/></p><p>He sighed, gritted his teeth and nodded, muttering, \u201cFine.\u201d and then proceeded to walk away.</p><p><br/></p><p>That night at dinner, you made the mistake of mentioning Katsuki again. Of course, you were forced to pick at your food in silence while your family took turns on suggesting all the reasons why you should take up an occupation under the Queen. </p><p><br/></p><p>If only they knew it went beyond a mere occupation.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p><br/></p><p>The fourth time you ran into Bakugo was definitely deliberate.</p><p><br/></p><p>He had been following you when you went out on a walk and as much as you wished to chastise him for intruding, you also wished to avoid a lifetime spent in a prison cell.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019m not going to give you any fucking options this time,\u201d Was what he called out to you as soon as you saw him, sending every bird in the vicinity flapping out of sight. He looked scarily determined and you feared the reason why. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming back to the castle with me whether you like it or not.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cKatsuki, I have a family\u2026\u201d You said, trailing off as he only got closer. He grabbed your chin gently, forced you to look at him. This time, he was calm, his voice lacked anger and he explained everything to you gently.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of them for you. You won\u2019t have to worry about anything but being a good queen.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Immediately, you could feel bile rising up in your throat and you nervously took a step back but his hand snaked round to prevent you from walking any further.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cCome on. You can write to your family once we get there. Don\u2019t try anything stupid, I think we\u2019d both hate to see your family get into debt.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>You had no choice but to follow him.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p><br/></p><p>Katsuki had pretty much abandoned you as soon as you got into the castle, leaving you in the hands of servants all following one hushed command from their prince. There was danger lurking in the smile he gave you before he left.</p><p><br/></p><p>As it turned out, all the servants were focused on making you\u2026 <i>presentable</i>.</p><p><br/></p><p>Beauty treatments, bathing, a mani-pedi- you were the cleanest and most dolled-up you\u2019d ever been in your entire life. Then you were handed a simplistic red gown and you were led further up the castle until you went into a room which you presumed to be Katsuki\u2019s. You took a cautious seat on the edge of his bed.</p><p><br/></p><p>When the door creaked open, you still chose to stare down at your lap, even when he walked over to you. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sulk,\u201d He said, placing a hand on your shoulder. As much as you tried to retract yourself, you stayed frozen in place, weak to his whims. \u201cI\u2019m going to make to make this so good for us. For you. And all you have to do is what I say- I won\u2019t even make it too hard.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>The hand ran up your neck and fiddled with some of your hair, tugging it experimentally to see if he\u2019d get a reaction. When your eyes darted up towards him, he pulled back, only to grab your hand and haul you up.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cMy first order is that you come down quietly so I can introduce you as who I\u2019m going to marry. I\u2019ve got more exciting things for after we eat but now,\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>He opened up the doors, leading you back down the hallways and in a new direction entirely. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWe appease the hag. Look happy. Play along. If she catches onto anything, I\u2019ll make sure that today\u2019s the last time you\u2019ll ever see daylight.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>You just let yourself be led through and into the dining room, where a blonde woman much alike Katsuki sat at the head of the table.</p><p><br/></p><p>And when Katsuki placed his hand over your own, you didn\u2019t draw back. You didn\u2019t wince while they talked about wedding plans and when he nudged you, you provided input. You didn\u2019t look distraught and responded to all of Katsuki\u2019s affections.</p><p><br/></p><p>But you did shiver when- after the queen had left, isolating you in Katsuki\u2019s suffocating adoration- Katsuki whispered huskily into your ear that he was going to reward you for being <i>such</i> a good girl.</p><p><br/></p>",

He came bolting at you, full speed without a care in the world for the human being on the opposing end of his force. You were left shocked, hitting the wall behind you with your back and only just managing to force out a small, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYeah- shit, I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>And it was only when he dusted himself off that you realised you were talking to the prince, famed for being brash and rude, a young man with only one goal in his mind- to prove himself and in doing so, have everyone under his thumb. All you could think of was that it was lucky he ran into you in an alleyway and not in public, in full view. You pinched the edge of your skirt in a weak curtsy, feeling the colour drain from you and your stomach twist.</p><p><br></p><p>In parallel with all his public statements, he gave you no apology but instead a mere justification. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI was trying to get away from the ball-\u201c</p><p><br></p><p>You\u2019d heard about that. Only nobles tended to go. It was always a fantasy in the back of your mind to sneak in but you never had the time, skills or effort to pull it off. Plus there was always the risk of getting arrested which would prevent you from supporting your family. You weren\u2019t exactly wealthy.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThe old hag\u2019s trying to get me to marry someone. Says she\u2019ll retire in a few months whether I like it or not. Lazy woman.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>You weren\u2019t sure whether to nod at that, would it count as treason if you did? </p><p><br></p><p>Luckily, he seemed to bring himself out of it. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAnyway. Take me somewhere I can lay low. No people. Now.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Hesitantly nodding, you motioned for him for follow you through the alley. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWould my bedroom be okay?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSure, whatever- just hurry the hell up before someone else comes up this alleyway.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>You\u2019d probably be able to silently sneak into your bedroom from the back of the building without alerting anyone. Hopefully you had left your window open.</p><p><br></p><p>As it turned out, you had and the two of you were able to climb in with the help of a few crates. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThis is it? It\u2019s small. Suppose we can\u2019t all live in castles.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Once you were in the room, the prince picked up trinkets and quizzed you about them. It was probably one of the most intimidating conversations you\u2019d ever had, always feeling like you were teetering on the edge of saying something wrong given his unamused grunts and mocking chuckles- even when he was asking for simple information like your name and upbringing. But gradually, you could see that he didn\u2019t mean to be rude, he just\u2026 was.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving now,\u201d he announced after roughly two hours. \u201cWatch where you\u2019re going next time.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>With gritted teeth you repressed an insult and replied, \u201cYes, my prince. Goodbye.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>He slid out of the window and vanished into the night.</p><p><br></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>The second time Bakugo ran into you, it could of been accidental. He came into your family\u2019s shop, of which you were shopkeeping. His clothes were a far cry from the finery you had originally seen him wear, hair wilder- still recognisable, but you supposed that he might of taken the long route to the store to avoid most of the town if he truly didn\u2019t want people seeing him.</p><p><br></p><p>You supposed that either Bakugo managed to distinguish your shop out of the street- somehow managing to remember it\u2019s location even after only seeing the dark back alley- or he couldof stumbled upon it by pure accident. He seemed to recognise you, smirked at you, then proceeded to ask for help with various items in the store, only picking up a select few to actually buy. And they were silly little things- sweets and pouches of herbs and small puzzles- perhaps he was going to give them to someone? Or maybe he just wanted them for himself, there wasn\u2019t anything wrong with that but you knew he could afford better.</p><p><br></p><p>For a good fifteen minutes, you had to run after him and assist him with anything he desired, all the while his hand rested somewhere on your body- dragging you by the wrist or resting on the small of your back.</p><p><br></p><p>And at long last, he finally decided to complete his purchase.</p><p><br></p><p>Bakugo\u2019s fingers drummed on the counter as he waited for you to count out the correct amount of change. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty good at this whole\u2026 helping thing. Ever considered a job in the castle?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNo, no I haven\u2019t, my prince.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cShit, that\u2019s a shame. You know, the offer\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep it in mind. Thank you.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Once he left, you went to clean up but immediately found yourself face to face with your mother, her hands on your shoulders and face lit up with excitement.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cA job at the castle! You know, I bet it would pay a lot better than you could ever get working here.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>The pay would be good, you already knew that. It\u2019s just that you weren\u2019t sure if you could actually deal with a job like that- deal with the Bakugos. You\u2019d hate to spend the rest of your life constantly on edge.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d You said, hoping to let her down easy. \u201cI want to be able to stay and support you-\u201c</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIf it bothers you so much, you could always send money back.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI guess, but\u2026\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBut you want to stay here?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYes. I do.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Your mother gave you a wry smile and a, \u201cWell, that\u2019s alright too\u201d and left you standing in the middle of the small store. With some hesitation, you brought yourself to get back behind the counter.</p><p><br></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p><br></p><p>The third time Bakugo ran into you seemed a little too coincidental for your liking.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOi, (Y/N)!\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>You were tending to your herb garden that was really a secluded, smaller plot of a shared community garden. It was one of your safe havens that you visited frequently, so it seemed a little off that the prince would suddenly be visiting, especially because he went so far into the garden that he was able to find you. Leaning against the back of a shed, he beckoned you over to join him, which you did. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI was looking for the hag\u2019s old garden that she kept as a kid. Any particularly overrun areas in this place?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>His piercing red eyes were locked onto yours, watching as you faltered and pointed over to a plot that had a shed and a flower pots with only weeds growing. He grabbed your wrist and tugged you along, unlocking the shed and doing some rummaging until he found a bag of seeds that he stuffed into his pocket. Then, he turned to face you.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cConsidered that job in the castle yet?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>You swallowed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t think I want to.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s light work with good pay. If you want to feel like you\u2019re really earning your keep I could find something harder- but I think you\u2019d be an idiot to turn this down.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my prince. I want to stay with my family.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>His demeanour didn\u2019t change and he continued to be persistent.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, just \u201cKatsuki\u201d is fine. How about this: come to the castle with me, see what it\u2019s like, maybe I can convince you to stay?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>The only thing you were able to do was shake your head.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>You realised his grasp on your wrist was back, tightening and making your eyes widen in fear as he only gazed into them with anger, never relenting, never leaving.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cFuck, fine! I\u2019ll tell it to you straight. Be my wife. Come home with me. Get married- to me. I\u2019ll make sure you get everything you could ever want.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Eventually, he released your wrist and his expression softened, he looked at the ground in what almost appeared to be shame. This did nothing to ease the panic coursing through your body.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s okay with you. You don\u2019t have to.\u201d He muttered begrudgingly. You assumed that his mother probably taught him this one crucial piece of etiquette.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m, I\u2019m <i>really</i> sorry, Katsuki.

He came bolting at you, full speed without a care in the world for the human being on the opposing end of his force. You were left shocked, hitting the wall behind you with your back and only just managing to force out a small, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYeah- shit, I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>And it was only when he dusted himself off that you realised you were talking to the prince, famed for being brash and rude, a young man with only one goal in his mind- to prove himself and in doing so, have everyone under his thumb. All you could think of was that it was lucky he ran into you in an alleyway and not in public, in full view. You pinched the edge of your skirt in a weak curtsy, feeling the colour drain from you and your stomach twist.</p><p><br></p><p>In parallel with all his public statements, he gave you no apology but instead a mere justification. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI was trying to get away from the ball-\u201c</p><p><br></p><p>You\u2019d heard about that. Only nobles tended to go. It was always a fantasy in the back of your mind to sneak in but you never had the time, skills or effort to pull it off. Plus there was always the risk of getting arrested which would prevent you from supporting your family. You weren\u2019t exactly wealthy.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThe old hag\u2019s trying to get me to marry someone. Says she\u2019ll retire in a few months whether I like it or not. Lazy woman.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>You weren\u2019t sure whether to nod at that, would it count as treason if you did? </p><p><br></p><p>Luckily, he seemed to bring himself out of it. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAnyway. Take me somewhere I can lay low. No people. Now.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Hesitantly nodding, you motioned for him for follow you through the alley. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWould my bedroom be okay?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSure, whatever- just hurry the hell up before someone else comes up this alleyway.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>You\u2019d probably be able to silently sneak into your bedroom from the back of the building without alerting anyone. Hopefully you had left your window open.</p><p><br></p><p>As it turned out, you had and the two of you were able to climb in with the help of a few crates. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThis is it? It\u2019s small. Suppose we can\u2019t all live in castles.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Once you were in the room, the prince picked up trinkets and quizzed you about them. It was probably one of the most intimidating conversations you\u2019d ever had, always feeling like you were teetering on the edge of saying something wrong given his unamused grunts and mocking chuckles- even when he was asking for simple information like your name and upbringing. But gradually, you could see that he didn\u2019t mean to be rude, he just\u2026 was.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving now,\u201d he announced after roughly two hours. \u201cWatch where you\u2019re going next time.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>With gritted teeth you repressed an insult and replied, \u201cYes, my prince. Goodbye.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>He slid out of the window and vanished into the night.</p><p><br></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>The second time Bakugo ran into you, it could of been accidental. He came into your family\u2019s shop, of which you were shopkeeping. His clothes were a far cry from the finery you had originally seen him wear, hair wilder- still recognisable, but you supposed that he might of taken the long route to the store to avoid most of the town if he truly didn\u2019t want people seeing him.</p><p><br></p><p>You supposed that either Bakugo managed to distinguish your shop out of the street- somehow managing to remember it\u2019s location even after only seeing the dark back alley- or he couldof stumbled upon it by pure accident. He seemed to recognise you, smirked at you, then proceeded to ask for help with various items in the store, only picking up a select few to actually buy. And they were silly little things- sweets and pouches of herbs and small puzzles- perhaps he was going to give them to someone? Or maybe he just wanted them for himself, there wasn\u2019t anything wrong with that but you knew he could afford better.</p><p><br></p><p>For a good fifteen minutes, you had to run after him and assist him with anything he desired, all the while his hand rested somewhere on your body- dragging you by the wrist or resting on the small of your back.</p><p><br></p><p>And at long last, he finally decided to complete his purchase.</p><p><br></p><p>Bakugo\u2019s fingers drummed on the counter as he waited for you to count out the correct amount of change. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty good at this whole\u2026 helping thing. Ever considered a job in the castle?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNo, no I haven\u2019t, my prince.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cShit, that\u2019s a shame. You know, the offer\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep it in mind. Thank you.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Once he left, you went to clean up but immediately found yourself face to face with your mother, her hands on your shoulders and face lit up with excitement.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cA job at the castle! You know, I bet it would pay a lot better than you could ever get working here.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>The pay would be good, you already knew that. It\u2019s just that you weren\u2019t sure if you could actually deal with a job like that- deal with the Bakugos. You\u2019d hate to spend the rest of your life constantly on edge.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d You said, hoping to let her down easy. \u201cI want to be able to stay and support you-\u201c</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIf it bothers you so much, you could always send money back.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI guess, but\u2026\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBut you want to stay here?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYes. I do.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Your mother gave you a wry smile and a, \u201cWell, that\u2019s alright too\u201d and left you standing in the middle of the small store. With some hesitation, you brought yourself to get back behind the counter.</p><p><br></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p><br></p><p>The third time Bakugo ran into you seemed a little too coincidental for your liking.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOi, (Y/N)!\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>You were tending to your herb garden that was really a secluded, smaller plot of a shared community garden. It was one of your safe havens that you visited frequently, so it seemed a little off that the prince would suddenly be visiting, especially because he went so far into the garden that he was able to find you. Leaning against the back of a shed, he beckoned you over to join him, which you did. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI was looking for the hag\u2019s old garden that she kept as a kid. Any particularly overrun areas in this place?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>His piercing red eyes were locked onto yours, watching as you faltered and pointed over to a plot that had a shed and a flower pots with only weeds growing. He grabbed your wrist and tugged you along, unlocking the shed and doing some rummaging until he found a bag of seeds that he stuffed into his pocket. Then, he turned to face you.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cConsidered that job in the castle yet?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>You swallowed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t think I want to.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s light work with good pay. If you want to feel like you\u2019re really earning your keep I could find something harder- but I think you\u2019d be an idiot to turn this down.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my prince. I want to stay with my family.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>His demeanour didn\u2019t change and he continued to be persistent.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, just \u201cKatsuki\u201d is fine. How about this: come to the castle with me, see what it\u2019s like, maybe I can convince you to stay?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>The only thing you were able to do was shake your head.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>You realised his grasp on your wrist was back, tightening and making your eyes widen in fear as he only gazed into them with anger, never relenting, never leaving.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cFuck, fine! I\u2019ll tell it to you straight. Be my wife. Come home with me. Get married- to me. I\u2019ll make sure you get everything you could ever want.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Eventually, he released your wrist and his expression softened, he looked at the ground in what almost appeared to be shame. This did nothing to ease the panic coursing through your body.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s okay with you. You don\u2019t have to.\u201d He muttered begrudgingly. You assumed that his mother probably taught him this one crucial piece of etiquette.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m, I\u2019m <i>really</i> sorry, Katsuki. I have family and friends here and I\u2019m not even a noble. Plus, I-\u201c</p><p><br></p><p>You had to steel yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really think you\u2019re my type. But we can be friends!\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>You supposed that was the politest way to put, \u201cI don\u2019t want to marry someone who drags me everywhere and constantly demands things from me\u201d.</p><p><br></p><p>He sighed, gritted his teeth and nodded, muttering, \u201cFine.\u201d and then proceeded to walk away.</p><p><br></p><p>That night at dinner, you made the mistake of mentioning Katsuki again. Of course, you were forced to pick at your food in silence while your family took turns on suggesting all the reasons why you should take up an occupation under the Queen. </p><p><br></p><p>If only they knew it went beyond a mere occupation.</p><p><br></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth time you ran into Bakugo was definitely deliberate.</p><p><br></p><p>He had been following you when you went out on a walk and as much as you wished to chastise him for intruding, you also wished to avoid a lifetime spent in a prison cell.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019m not going to give you any fucking options this time,\u201d Was what he called out to you as soon as you saw him, sending every bird in the vicinity flapping out of sight. He looked scarily determined and you feared the reason why. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming back to the castle with me whether you like it or not.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cKatsuki, I have a family\u2026\u201d You said, trailing off as he only got closer. He grabbed your chin gently, forced you to look at him. This time, he was calm, his voice lacked anger and he explained everything to you gently.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of them for you. You won\u2019t have to worry about anything but being a good queen.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Immediately, you could feel bile rising up in your throat and you nervously took a step back but his hand snaked round to prevent you from walking any further.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cCome on. You can write to your family once we get there. Don\u2019t try anything stupid, I think we\u2019d both hate to see your family get into debt.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>You had no choice but to follow him.</p><p><br></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p><br></p><p>Katsuki had pretty much abandoned you as soon as you got into the castle, leaving you in the hands of servants all following one hushed command from their prince. There was danger lurking in the smile he gave you before he left.</p><p><br></p><p>As it turned out, all the servants were focused on making you\u2026 <i>presentable</i>.</p><p><br></p><p>Beauty treatments, bathing, a mani-pedi- you were the cleanest and most dolled-up you\u2019d ever been in your entire life. Then you were handed a simplistic red gown and you were led further up the castle until you went into a room which you presumed to be Katsuki\u2019s. You took a cautious seat on the edge of his bed.</p><p><br></p><p>When the door creaked open, you still chose to stare down at your lap, even when he walked over to you. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sulk,\u201d He said, placing a hand on your shoulder. As much as you tried to retract yourself, you stayed frozen in place, weak to his whims. \u201cI\u2019m going to make to make this so good for us. For you. And all you have to do is what I say- I won\u2019t even make it too hard.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>The hand ran up your neck and fiddled with some of your hair, tugging it experimentally to see if he\u2019d get a reaction. When your eyes darted up towards him, he pulled back, only to grab your hand and haul you up.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMy first order is that you come down quietly so I can introduce you as who I\u2019m going to marry. I\u2019ve got more exciting things for after we eat but now,\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>He opened up the doors, leading you back down the hallways and in a new direction entirely. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWe appease the hag. Look happy. Play along. If she catches onto anything, I\u2019ll make sure that today\u2019s the last time you\u2019ll ever see daylight.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>You just let yourself be led through and into the dining room, where a blonde woman much alike Katsuki sat at the head of the table.</p><p><br></p><p>And when Katsuki placed his hand over your own, you didn\u2019t draw back. You didn\u2019t wince while they talked about wedding plans and when he nudged you, you provided input. You didn\u2019t look distraught and responded to all of Katsuki\u2019s affections.</p><p><br></p><p>But you did shiver when- after the queen had left, isolating you in Katsuki\u2019s suffocating adoration- Katsuki whispered huskily into your ear that he was going to reward you for being <i>such</i> a good girl.</p><p><br></p>",

You won&rsquo;t have to worry about anything but being a good queen.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Immediately, you could feel bile rising up in your throat and you nervously took a step back but his hand snaked round to prevent you from walking any further.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Come on. You can write to your family once we get there. Don&rsquo;t try anything stupid, I think we&rsquo;d both hate to see your family get into debt.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>You had no choice but to follow him.</p><p><br /></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p><br /></p><p>Katsuki had pretty much abandoned you as soon as you got into the castle, leaving you in the hands of servants all following one hushed command from their prince. There was danger lurking in the smile he gave you before he left.</p><p><br /></p><p>As it turned out, all the servants were focused on making you&hellip; <i>presentable</i>.</p><p><br /></p><p>Beauty treatments, bathing, a mani-pedi- you were the cleanest and most dolled-up you&rsquo;d ever been in your entire life. Then you were handed a simplistic red gown and you were led further up the castle until you went into a room which you presumed to be Katsuki&rsquo;s. You took a cautious seat on the edge of his bed.</p><p><br /></p><p>When the door creaked open, you still chose to stare down at your lap, even when he walked over to you. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sulk,&rdquo; He said, placing a hand on your shoulder. As much as you tried to retract yourself, you stayed frozen in place, weak to his whims. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make to make this so good for us. For you. And all you have to do is what I say- I won&rsquo;t even make it too hard.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>The hand ran up your neck and fiddled with some of your hair, tugging it experimentally to see if he&rsquo;d get a reaction. When your eyes darted up towards him, he pulled back, only to grab your hand and haul you up.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;My first order is that you come down quietly so I can introduce you as who I&rsquo;m going to marry. I&rsquo;ve got more exciting things for after we eat but now,&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>He opened up the doors, leading you back down the hallways and in a new direction entirely. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;We appease the hag. Look happy. Play along. If she catches onto anything, I&rsquo;ll make sure that today&rsquo;s the last time you&rsquo;ll ever see daylight.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>You just let yourself be led through and into the dining room, where a blonde woman much alike Katsuki sat at the head of the table.</p><p><br /></p><p>And when Katsuki placed his hand over your own, you didn&rsquo;t draw back. You didn&rsquo;t wince while they talked about wedding plans and when he nudged you, you provided input. You didn&rsquo;t look distraught and responded to all of Katsuki&rsquo;s affections.</p><p><br /></p><p>But you did shiver when- after the queen had left, isolating you in Katsuki&rsquo;s suffocating adoration- Katsuki whispered huskily into your ear that he was going to reward you for being <i>such</i> a good girl.</p><p><br /></p>",

Tamaki is an angel and I love him with all my being. I didn\u2019t make this x reader at all, decided to keep it to just Tamaki and his son.</p><hr><p>No matter how much Tamaki had prepared himself for this day, the hours spent prior hyping himself up, he just couldn\u2019t help but tear up at the thought of his young son going to school. Chou was eating his cereal, watching the morning cartoons as his father paced, biting his lip. Tamaki hated this, having to deal with it alone as his partner had gone to work.</p><p>\u201cYou excited for school, Chou?\u201d Tamaki asked, wiping his son\u2019s face from the milk, his eyes were still glued to the TV. Chou didn\u2019t say anything for a moment before glaring at his father.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m going to get bullied.\u201d<br/></p><p>Tamaki stared at his son, his movements paused.\u00a0\u201cW-why do you say that?\u201d Tamaki asked, eyes a little wide. That was one of the things he was fearing and this just made him even more paranoid.\u00a0\u201cChou is a girl\u2019s name&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s cute,\u201d Tamaki said, smiling as he reached for the comb to fix Chou\u2019s messy bed head,\u00a0\u201cmany boys have a more&hellip;traditional girl\u2019s name and vice versa, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>While it didn\u2019t help too much, Chou just pouted and eventually nodded along, standing up to go get his school clothes on. As soon as he was out of sight, Tamaki sighed. He tried to convince himself that Chou would be okay.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Tamaki didn\u2019t let go of Chou\u2019s hand for even a second as they walked to his new school. He was sweating and hoped Chou didn\u2019t notice. His son was smart and clearly noticed as he tugged his hand away and wiped it off his trousers, giving his dad a little glare as though to say\u00a0\u2018that\u2019s gross!\u2019</p><p>When the school came into sight, Tamaki thought he\u2019d pass out.\u00a0\u201cWant me to come in with you?\u201d Tamaki asked his son, hoping he\u2019d say yes. But when Chou shook his head and let go off his dad\u2019s hand, Tamaki tried to hide the small cry that escaped him.\u00a0\u201cO-okay. Have fun, I love you.\u201d</p><p>Chou glanced up at his father and sighed, wrapping his arms around him.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re such a big baby, dad.\u201d He said, grinning a little.
