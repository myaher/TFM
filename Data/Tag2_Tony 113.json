        "body": "<h2><b>Irondad || Angst &amp; Comfort || WC: 3.6k</b></h2><p>Peter was patrolling 14th Street when he heard a loud BANG, followed by the unmistakable tire squeal of a car veering off the road.<br/></p><p>He immediately swung into action, ricocheting off and around buildings to where he heard the noise.</p><p>Peter had dealt with car crashes before. An oblivious new young driver ran a stop sign, or someone checked their phone while behind the wheel, and the car swerved to the next lane over.</p><p>The injuries were generally the same - minor cuts or bruises, or, on the more severe end of the spectrum, a concussion. On any other day, Peter would arrive at the scene, help people out of the cars, wait for the authorities to arrive, and swing off again.</p><p>This was not any other day.</p><!-- more --><p>After swinging around the final corner, Peter almost fell when he saw the scene before him.</p><p>One of the vehicles, a shiny new sports car, lay on its side as smoke billowed from the hood. A tire was rolling lazily away from the vehicle as the surrounding cars had formed a ring-like space around it, all swerving to avoid the catastrophe.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t what concerned Peter the most.</p><p>In front of the overturned car, having plowed into the brick wall of a shoe store, was a minivan, the bumper sticker of a mother, father, and three baby girls on the back window.</p><p>The minivan had hit the wall hard enough to leave a dent, dust beginning to rise from the settling brick. The entire right side of the vehicle was pressed against the wall, parts of it dented and crumpled from the pure force of the impact.</p><p>Peter tried to shake off the hollow feeling of dread in his stomach as he shook his head and swung into action.</p><p>He went first for the minivan, the three smiling stick figures of children seeming to taunt Peter as he brought himself down in the middle of the street, quickly running the final steps to the red van.</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Peter jumped at the sudden reminder of Karen. \u201cDo you require my assistance?\u201d</p><p>Peter found his head spinning. Why - why couldn\u2019t he focus? He was <i>Spiderman</i>. He had rescued people from car crashes before. He could do this.</p><p>\u201cY-yeah, Karen.\u201d He hated how young his voice shouted.</p><p>\u201cBefore we begin, there is gasoline dripping from the vehicle behind you. It may light soon.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s breath quickened. \u201cLet\u2019s make this fast, then.\u201d He reassessed the vehicle in front of him, fighting to keep his breathing steady. \u201cWhere\u2019s my best point of entry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDriver\u2019s side door is the only one not tainted by rubble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Karen.\u201d</p><p>Peter reached out a shaking hand <i>(why was it shaking?)</i> and gripped the handle, easily pulling it open with his extra strength. Spoke billowed out but his mask stopped him from squinting against it. And when it cleared\u2026.</p><p>He expected crying.</p><p>Screaming.</p><p>Pleads for help.</p><p>He didn\u2019t expect <i>silence</i>.</p><p>Peter\u2019s heart beat faster, blocking out the noises of the oncoming sirens. <i>Were they even still there? Was help ever coming?</i></p><p>\u201cPeter, a small fire has started in the engine of the vehicle behind you.\u201d Karen\u2019s soft voice interrupted his thoughts, but at the moment even the gentle AI couldn\u2019t snap him out of his predicament. Peter ignored her and instead asked his own question, focusing on the slumped-over man behind the wheel, not being able to take his eyes off where the man\u2019s eyes were - were rolled back in his-</p><p>\u201cKaren, read his vitals.\u201d</p><p>His heart pounded in his throat as he assessed the pale face and the blood dripping down the various wounds of the man before him. The airbag was deployed but it was tinted - it was tinted <i>red</i>-</p><p>\u201cDead. No vitals.\u201d</p><p>Peter felt like he was going to throw up.</p><p>\u201cPeter, the fire is spreading dangerously close to the gasoline-\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead the woman\u2019s vitals,\u201d he ignored her, finding the mother in the passenger seat.</p><p>His limbs felt like lead, and he wasn\u2019t sure how long he stood there, waiting for Karen\u2019s response.</p><p>Could\u2019ve been days.</p><p>Could\u2019ve been mere seconds.</p><p>It didn\u2019t change her answer.</p><p>\u201cDead. No vitals.\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head.</p><p>Spiderman.</p><p><i>He was Spiderman.</i></p><p>Focus.</p><p>\u201cPeter, the flame-\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaren,\u201d he choked out. He had to save them. He was Spiderman; he <i>had </i>to save them.</p><p>\u201cCheck for heat signatures in the back.\u201d</p><p>Maybe the stickers were left on the van from the last owner. Maybe there weren\u2019t any kids <i>in </i>the van-</p><p>\u201cThree heat signatures detected.\u201d</p><p>Peter fought to move, to see them, to open the door to the back seat and help the children out - children. There were <i>children </i>back there.</p><p>But all he could do was gasp out, \u201cRead vitals.\u201d</p><p>Everything went quiet.</p><p>Still.</p><p>Silent.</p><p>The world itself seemed to stop spinning as Peter awaited the response.</p><p>\u201cAll dead. No vitals.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s brain shut down.</p><p>Then, it went into hyperdrive.</p><p>Peter\u2019s breath quickened as he backed away - <i>stumbled </i>away from the car, staggering as he clutched a hand to his chest. He couldn\u2019t breathe, <i>couldn\u2019t breathe-</i></p><p>\u201cPeter, you have to leave <i>now</i>. The car is about to explode.\u201d</p><p>Peter just shook his head and fell to his knees as his ears altered between hearing everything, and hearing nothing.</p><p>He was Spiderman. He should have the strength to get up and save himself.</p><p><i>But was it worth it, if everyone else was dead?</i></p><p>Suddenly, a force hit Peter from behind, and he went flying.</p><ul><li>\u2022 \u2022</li>\n</ul><p>\u201cPeter? Pete! You gotta get up, bud.\u201d A shiver of dread raced up Tony\u2019s spine as he watched the boy lying limp on the pavement, the fire behind him being put out by firemen.</p><p>He had been notified as soon as Peter went unconscious by Karen. Already, he was planning 20 different changes he could make to the suit to better protect Peter. To notify Tony <i>before </i>his kid went unconscious.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t matter now. All that did was that Peter was <i>still </i>unresponsive.</p><p>As soon as Tony was notified of Peter\u2019s condition, he raced to suit up and fly to his location, only keeping the suit on once he landed long enough to hear F.R.I.D.A.Y. tell him Peter was alive and in stable condition, before disengaging it and racing, as nothing more than Tony Stark, to the kid\u2019s side. Still, Tony couldn\u2019t stop the anxious thoughts racing through his mind, mainly revolving around the suit.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t Karen warn Peter when he was in danger? What had Tony done wrong with the programming of the suit?</p><p>How had he failed his kid so terribly?</p><p>The thoughts were quickly erased from his mind when a groan was emitted from the body on the floor.</p><p>\u201cPeter? You with me?\u201d</p><p>The boy\u2019s eyes fluttered open, Tony removing his mask just enough to see his face, but using Tony\u2019s own body to shield him from the crowd forming not far from the two. Tony knew he had to get the kid out of there. Iron Man and Spiderman crouched beside a still-smoking car crash? The news reports would be brutal.</p><p>Still, he wanted to be absolutely positive Peter was okay before moving him.</p><p>\u201cMis\u2019r S\u2019ark,\u201d Peter mumbled groggily, mouth full of cotton. Tony sighed as he momentarily rested back on his heels. He ran a hand over his forehead, stopping at the bridge of his nose as his heartbeat slowed significantly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving my gray hairs, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018M sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize.\u201d</p><p>Tony gently readjusted the kid\u2019s mask so it covered his face once more, promising himself to take it off as soon as the cameras people had begin to point their way were out of sight. His chest panged when Peter\u2019s large brown eyes left his sight, and he desperately wanted to keep the mask off and just keep looking into them to assure himself that <i>Peter was okay</i>, but he knew the last thing the kid would want was others knowing his identity.</p><p>So he kept the mask on.</p><p>Tony called his suit back to him as soon as he had convinced himself Peter was alright. \u201cCome on kid, let\u2019s go back to the tower. Can you stand?\u201d</p><p>He pushed himself to his feet, waiting for the kid to join him, but he found himself waiting a second too long. A glance to where Peter remained on the floor explained why.</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes looked desperate, lost, as they drifted over the scene before him. The fire, the overturned cars-</p><p>Tony himself had to choke back a sob.</p><p>The bodies in the front seats.</p><p>And the three in the back.</p><p>\u201cKid, don\u2019t look.\u201d His voice came out weak, quivering, because it was too little, too late. Peter had already seen the damage, and no matter what Tony did, he could never remove those horrors from his kid\u2019s mind.</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Tony urged his voice to come out stronger, more in control, as his two metal-clad hands gripped Peter\u2019s shoulders and forced them away from the wreckage. Peter fought him at first, but then allowed himself to be turned.</p><p>Allowed Tony to see the raw <i>emotion </i>on his face.</p><p>His eyes were red with unshed tears, but they weren\u2019t sad. No, they were <i>lost</i>. Hopeless. Guilt-ridden. Staring somewhere beyond Tony. Somewhere <i>through </i>him.</p><p>Like he wasn\u2019t even there.</p><p>Tony gripped his shoulder a bit tighter, essentially holding the kid up.</p><p>\u201cPete. Hey, look at me.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, hesitantly, the kid\u2019s eyes lolled their way up to find Tony\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cNot your fault.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded slowly, as if he was in a trance. Tony knew he didn\u2019t actually agree. He wouldn\u2019t for a long while, maybe even ever - Tony understood better than most.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go back to the tower?\u201d he murmured gently, offering his arms to Peter and helping him to his feet.</p><p>Tony allowed the kid to curl into his arms as they lifted into the sky, leaving the wreckage behind.</p><ul><li>\u2022 \u2022</li>\n</ul><p>When they touched down at the tower, it took Peter longer than expected to detangle himself from his mentor\u2019s iron-clad arms. He moved slow, sluggish, and Tony\u2019s heart ached as he watched his kid trudge into the tower.</p><p>Tony followed not too far behind, thinking back to his own mistakes, all the times he\u2019d let civilians die. How afterwards he\u2019s had trouble eating, sleeping. The first time he lost a civilian, shot in a shootout Tony was trying to prevent, he considered hanging up the suit altogether.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t.</p><p>And he would make sure Peter wouldn\u2019t, either.</p><p>Take a seat on the couch, Pete,\u201d he spoke softly when he saw Peter standing in the middle of the foyer, looking lost. \u201cYou can even turn on one of those Star Wars movies, if you like. I\u2019ll actually allow you to do it. Take advantage.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded slowly, avoiding eye contact, as he slowly stumbled to the couch and collapsed, gingerly reaching for the remote and beginning to flip through the channels.</p><p>Tony sighed, sending one last look to his kid before jogging up the stairs and returning not two minutes later with a pile of blankets. He didn\u2019t hesitate to recline on the couch beside his kid and wrap him in the fluffiest one, knowing Peter wouldn\u2019t be opposed to the sudden contact.</p><p>But Tony wondered if he even noticed it at all.</p><p>His shoulders remained stiff, eyes focused on what was playing on the t.v., the news-</p><p>The news? But Peter <i>hated </i>the news. All the politics and arguments didn\u2019t sit right with him.</p><p>He was about to speak up when he heard an intake of breath beside him followed by a soft voice.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t hate me.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s breath caught in his throat.</p><p>Peter was shaking where he was huddled on the couch, his eyes not moving from where his knees were tucked to his chest, refusing to look up.</p><p>Tony watched his kid in disbelief, not understanding how Peter could say something so - so <i>stupid</i>. How the <i>heck</i> could Peter ever believe Tony would hate him? That was his <i>kid</i>. Peter could do anything and Tony would support him - even <i>murder</i>. Heck, Tony would help him hide the body.</p><p>With a cringe, Tony realized he had waited too long to answer as Peter\u2019s shuddering grew more violent.</p><p>Tony rested a hand on his shoulder. Peter lightly flinched, but Tony decided not to take it personally when the kid leaned into his touch shortly after.</p><p>\u201cPeter, look at me.\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head.</p><p>Tony gripped his shoulder tighter and forced the kid around to look at him. Tony <i>hated </i>how harsh he was being, but he needed the kid to understand.</p><p>He gently placed two fingers under Peter\u2019s chin and lifted his face until Peter\u2019s large, watering brown eyes met Tony\u2019s own.</p><p>\u201cListen to me.\u201d There was more passion in his voice than he had expected, but he wasn\u2019t surprised. Tony would <i>kill </i>for Peter.</p><p>\u201cI will never, <i>ever</i>, hate you, you hear me? No matter what happens, I know the real you. I know you would never do anything to warrant my-\u201d Tony had trouble even getting the word out. \u201c-my <i>hatred</i>!\u201d</p><p>Peter still looked unsure as he fidgeted him hands in his lap, shifting uncomfortably as his eyes searched the room, chin held tightly in Tony\u2019s grasp.</p><p>\u201cBut you - you have to k-kick me out of the Av-Avengers now.\u201d</p><p>A look of confusion crossed Tony\u2019s features as he fought to not let his fingers clench in anger at how little Peter placed his self-worth.</p><p>He forced his voice to calm as his eyes softened.</p><p>\u201cAnd why would I do that?\u201d</p><p>Peter leaned back to remove his chin from Tony\u2019s grip. Tony complied, letting his hand fall to his lap as Peter looked down, ashamed, his voice deathly quiet.</p><p>\u201cI - I killed-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Tony cut him off with newfound ferocity in his voice, making Peter wince. Screw gentle. Peter needed to understand. Tony <i>desperately</i> needed Peter to understand. \u201cYou did <i>not </i>kill them. Did you crash the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no, but-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you pour out the gasoline?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>No</i>-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you set the fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were <i>kids</i>, Tony!\u201d</p><p>Tony froze at the sudden outburst, Peter\u2019s eyes widening at the use of the name.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Peter rushed to gasp out, but Tony just held up a finger.</p><p>\u201cNo apologizing, kid.\u201d</p><p>Peter paused a moment before letting out a light chuckle, catching the both of them off guard.</p><p>\u201cThat word felt really weird coming out of my mouth.\u201d</p><p>Tony raised his eyebrows before falling into a small fit of laughter himself.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna stick with Mr. Stark.\u201d Tony nodded, appreciating the opportunity for humour, the chance to laugh with his kid again.</p><p>But the dark, haunted look that returned to cloud Peter\u2019s sullen eyes reminded Tony of the underlying threat still at hand.</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Tony called the kid\u2019s attention back to him. \u201cJust answer this for me. What more could you have done to save them?\u201d</p><p>Peter hesitated for a moment, looking lost; then-</p><p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t taken so long to get my stuff out of my locker after school, maybe I would\u2019ve been on that corner before it happened. I could\u2019ve stopped it.\u201d</p><p>Tony watched his kid with pity. This was the worst part of any mission - the \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d. What if I had moved a bit faster? What if I had turned left rather than right?</p><p>But Tony had enough experience to know that there would always be \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d. Things would always go wrong. It was how you dealt with it that mattered.</p><p>\u201cI need you to listen to me, kid.\u201d Peter looked up at Tony with wide, watering eyes, giving him a look that made Tony want to lock the doors and separate them from the outside world. Just the two of them, safe and protected forever.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t hide himself, and neither could Peter. They had to deal with this, to fight it. Tony would make sure Peter knew he was loved. He was <i>appreciated</i>. That never in a million years would he be <i>hated</i>.</p><p>\u201cThis was not your fault. No interrupting.\u201d Tony held up a finger when Peter opened his mouth, and he closed it again dejectedly. \u201cYou can\u2019t save everyone, kid, no matter how hard you try. And it\u2019s gonna suck. After an event like this, you\u2019re gonna want to hang up your suit. Stop fighting.\u201d Peter looked down at his lap, ashamed, and Tony guessed he had hit the nail on the head.</p><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t. This happens to everyone, kid. Happened to me.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes flashed up in shock, and Tony chuckled humorlessly at the response.</p><p>\u201cYeah, kid, even Iron Man can\u2019t save everyone. Goodness knows I tried.\u201d</p><p>It was quiet for a minute, until Peter whispered a quiet, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Tony focused straight ahead, thinking back to the one memory that would haunt him every time he put on the suit. It had been a while ago, but he still hadn\u2019t quite forgiven himself yet. Ironic, then, that he was teaching Peter to move on. Tony just hoped that Peter could be better than he himself ever was.</p><p>\u201cIt was one of my first times wearing the suit,\u201d Tony started, staring somewhere into the distance. Peter waited quietly.</p><p>\u201cI was just flying over the city, testing out my thrusters, when I heard screaming. It was a man, with a gun, in the middle of an intersection. So I touched down and raised my thruster-\u201d</p><p>Peter clutched a hand to his mouth with a gasp. Tony looked up suddenly, realizing what it must\u2019ve sounded like.</p><p>\u201cNo, kid, geez, no, I didn\u2019t shoot him.\u201d Peter seemed to relax, but Tony inwardly cursed himself. Tony was finally proving to be the terrible monster Peter had always been too innocent to notice.</p><p>\u201cBut that was part of the problem. See, I waited too long, said some smart-ass comment-\u201d Tony sighed as he ran a hand down his face to pinch the bridge of his nose. The memory still haunted him, the look on the girl\u2019s face clear as day.</p><p>\u201cHe aimed the gun and shot it and it - it hit-\u201d</p><p>Tony cut himself off, not being able to continue. The memories were just too strong.</p><p>Tony was started by Peter moving on the couch to sit closer to his mentor, his small frame providing an insurmountable amount of comfort to the mechanic as Tony wrapped his arm around his kid and held him close.</p><p>\u201cIt was a young girl,\u201d Tony found the strength to continue, though he knew that when he finished, Peter would never look at him the same way. He guessed it was for the best, though - Tony needed to put as much distance between the two of them as possible. As much as he loved the kid, If he continued to hang around Tony, he would get hurt, or worse. The story just helped prove that.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t have been older than five. And you want to hear what she said to bring the gunman\u2019s attention to her?\u201d</p><p>Tony blinked the tears from his eyes as the words, the voice, replayed themselves in his mind, clear as day. They were the sounds that had haunted him for the longest time, and would continue to until - well, Tony didn\u2019t know how long it would be until he forgot. Maybe never. And honestly, he didn\u2019t even know if he <i>wanted </i>to forget. He was responsible for that girl\u2019s death. He had no right to a clear conscience.</p><p>\u201cShe said, \u2018Look, mom, it\u2019s Iron Man. He\u2019ll save us.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Tony felt Peter tense in his side but tried to cherish the feeling of his kid leaning against him, realizing it might be the last time Peter would ever want to be close to him.</p><p><i>Seems about right</i>, he thought as he hastily wiped away a tear he hadn\u2019t even realized had fallen. <i>Now Peter realizes what a monster I am. I\u2019m not a hero, I\u2019m-</i></p><p>Suddenly, Peter was wrapping his arms around his mentor, resting his chin on his shoulder as Tony looked down at him in surprise.</p><p>\u201cKid, what-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot your fault.\u201d</p><p>Tony stared down at the matted curls of his kid incredulously. Why was Peter hugging him? He had killed a five-year-old-</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Geez</i>, kid, can you read minds or something?\u201d Tony gasped, but Peter just held him tighter. Tony rested a light hand on Peter\u2019s head, fingers threading through his soft curls.</p><p>\u201cDid you aim the gun at her?\u201d</p><p>Tony chuckled at the irony and couldn\u2019t held smiling at how <i>selfless </i>the kid was.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you pull the trigger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Did </i>you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Peter sat back up like that decided it.</p><p>\u201cThen you didn\u2019t kill her.\u201d</p><p>Tony sighed quietly as he leaned back into the couch cushions.</p><p>\u201cStill hurts.\u201d</p><p>Peter mirrored his position.</p><p>\u201cSo this feeling will never go away, then?\u201d</p><p>Tony turned his gaze to the kid and saw his brown eyes looking back sadly. Tony shook his head slightly.</p><p>\u201cNo, but you can try to move on.\u201d He spoke stronger, as if he really believed in what he was saying. For Peter\u2019s sake, at least. \u201cTry to continue saving people. Being a hero isn\u2019t the mistakes you didn\u2019t make; it\u2019s coming back from the ones you did.\u201d</p><p>Peter smiled then, but Tony could still see the brokenness behind it. He figured he would for a while. He would help him, though. He would save Peter, help him get back on his feet.</p><p>And he would never leave him. No, Peter was his kid.</p><p>Maybe that was selfish. Maybe Tony\u2019s self-destructive tendencies would rub off on the kid - maybe something worse would. Tony didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Peter was his kid, and Tony would never leave him.</p>",

An oblivious new young driver ran a stop sign, or someone checked their phone while behind the wheel, and the car swerved to the next lane over.</p><p>The injuries were generally the same - minor cuts or bruises, or, on the more severe end of the spectrum, a concussion. On any other day, Peter would arrive at the scene, help people out of the cars, wait for the authorities to arrive, and swing off again.</p><p>This was not any other day.</p>[[MORE]]<p>After swinging around the final corner, Peter almost fell when he saw the scene before him.</p><p>One of the vehicles, a shiny new sports car, lay on its side as smoke billowed from the hood. A tire was rolling lazily away from the vehicle as the surrounding cars had formed a ring-like space around it, all swerving to avoid the catastrophe.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t what concerned Peter the most.</p><p>In front of the overturned car, having plowed into the brick wall of a shoe store, was a minivan, the bumper sticker of a mother, father, and three baby girls on the back window.</p><p>The minivan had hit the wall hard enough to leave a dent, dust beginning to rise from the settling brick. The entire right side of the vehicle was pressed against the wall, parts of it dented and crumpled from the pure force of the impact.</p><p>Peter tried to shake off the hollow feeling of dread in his stomach as he shook his head and swung into action.</p><p>He went first for the minivan, the three smiling stick figures of children seeming to taunt Peter as he brought himself down in the middle of the street, quickly running the final steps to the red van.</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Peter jumped at the sudden reminder of Karen. \u201cDo you require my assistance?\u201d</p><p>Peter found his head spinning. Why - why couldn\u2019t he focus? He was <i>Spiderman</i>. He had rescued people from car crashes before. He could do this.</p><p>\u201cY-yeah, Karen.\u201d He hated how young his voice shouted.</p><p>\u201cBefore we begin, there is gasoline dripping from the vehicle behind you. It may light soon.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s breath quickened. \u201cLet\u2019s make this fast, then.\u201d He reassessed the vehicle in front of him, fighting to keep his breathing steady. \u201cWhere\u2019s my best point of entry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDriver\u2019s side door is the only one not tainted by rubble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Karen.\u201d</p><p>Peter reached out a shaking hand <i>(why was it shaking?)</i> and gripped the handle, easily pulling it open with his extra strength. Spoke billowed out but his mask stopped him from squinting against it. And when it cleared\u2026.</p><p>He expected crying.</p><p>Screaming.</p><p>Pleads for help.</p><p>He didn\u2019t expect <i>silence</i>.</p><p>Peter\u2019s heart beat faster, blocking out the noises of the oncoming sirens. <i>Were they even still there? Was help ever coming?</i></p><p>\u201cPeter, a small fire has started in the engine of the vehicle behind you.\u201d Karen\u2019s soft voice interrupted his thoughts, but at the moment even the gentle AI couldn\u2019t snap him out of his predicament. Peter ignored her and instead asked his own question, focusing on the slumped-over man behind the wheel, not being able to take his eyes off where the man\u2019s eyes were - were rolled back in his-</p><p>\u201cKaren, read his vitals.\u201d</p><p>His heart pounded in his throat as he assessed the pale face and the blood dripping down the various wounds of the man before him. The airbag was deployed but it was tinted - it was tinted <i>red</i>-</p><p>\u201cDead. No vitals.\u201d</p><p>Peter felt like he was going to throw up.</p><p>\u201cPeter, the fire is spreading dangerously close to the gasoline-\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead the woman\u2019s vitals,\u201d he ignored her, finding the mother in the passenger seat.</p><p>His limbs felt like lead, and he wasn\u2019t sure how long he stood there, waiting for Karen\u2019s response.</p><p>Could\u2019ve been days.</p><p>Could\u2019ve been mere seconds.</p><p>It didn\u2019t change her answer.</p><p>\u201cDead. No vitals.\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head.</p><p>Spiderman.</p><p><i>He was Spiderman.</i></p><p>Focus.</p><p>\u201cPeter, the flame-\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaren,\u201d he choked out. He had to save them. He was Spiderman; he <i>had </i>to save them.</p><p>\u201cCheck for heat signatures in the back.\u201d</p><p>Maybe the stickers were left on the van from the last owner. Maybe there weren\u2019t any kids <i>in </i>the van-</p><p>\u201cThree heat signatures detected.\u201d</p><p>Peter fought to move, to see them, to open the door to the back seat and help the children out - children. There were <i>children </i>back there.</p><p>But all he could do was gasp out, \u201cRead vitals.\u201d</p><p>Everything went quiet.</p><p>Still.</p><p>Silent.</p><p>The world itself seemed to stop spinning as Peter awaited the response.</p><p>\u201cAll dead. No vitals.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s brain shut down.</p><p>Then, it went into hyperdrive.</p><p>Peter\u2019s breath quickened as he backed away - <i>stumbled </i>away from the car, staggering as he clutched a hand to his chest. He couldn\u2019t breathe, <i>couldn\u2019t breathe-</i></p><p>\u201cPeter, you have to leave <i>now</i>. The car is about to explode.\u201d</p><p>Peter just shook his head and fell to his knees as his ears altered between hearing everything, and hearing nothing.</p><p>He was Spiderman. He should have the strength to get up and save himself.</p><p><i>But was it worth it, if everyone else was dead?</i></p><p>Suddenly, a force hit Peter from behind, and he went flying.</p><ul><li>\u2022 \u2022</li>\n</ul><p>\u201cPeter? Pete! You gotta get up, bud.\u201d A shiver of dread raced up Tony\u2019s spine as he watched the boy lying limp on the pavement, the fire behind him being put out by firemen.</p><p>He had been notified as soon as Peter went unconscious by Karen. Already, he was planning 20 different changes he could make to the suit to better protect Peter. To notify Tony <i>before </i>his kid went unconscious.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t matter now. All that did was that Peter was <i>still </i>unresponsive.</p><p>As soon as Tony was notified of Peter\u2019s condition, he raced to suit up and fly to his location, only keeping the suit on once he landed long enough to hear F.R.I.D.A.Y. tell him Peter was alive and in stable condition, before disengaging it and racing, as nothing more than Tony Stark, to the kid\u2019s side. Still, Tony couldn\u2019t stop the anxious thoughts racing through his mind, mainly revolving around the suit.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t Karen warn Peter when he was in danger? What had Tony done wrong with the programming of the suit?</p><p>How had he failed his kid so terribly?</p><p>The thoughts were quickly erased from his mind when a groan was emitted from the body on the floor.</p><p>\u201cPeter? You with me?\u201d</p><p>The boy\u2019s eyes fluttered open, Tony removing his mask just enough to see his face, but using Tony\u2019s own body to shield him from the crowd forming not far from the two. Tony knew he had to get the kid out of there. Iron Man and Spiderman crouched beside a still-smoking car crash? The news reports would be brutal.</p><p>Still, he wanted to be absolutely positive Peter was okay before moving him.</p><p>\u201cMis\u2019r S\u2019ark,\u201d Peter mumbled groggily, mouth full of cotton. Tony sighed as he momentarily rested back on his heels. He ran a hand over his forehead, stopping at the bridge of his nose as his heartbeat slowed significantly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving my gray hairs, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018M sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize.\u201d</p><p>Tony gently readjusted the kid\u2019s mask so it covered his face once more, promising himself to take it off as soon as the cameras people had begin to point their way were out of sight. His chest panged when Peter\u2019s large brown eyes left his sight, and he desperately wanted to keep the mask off and just keep looking into them to assure himself that <i>Peter was okay</i>, but he knew the last thing the kid would want was others knowing his identity.</p><p>So he kept the mask on.</p><p>Tony called his suit back to him as soon as he had convinced himself Peter was alright. \u201cCome on kid, let\u2019s go back to the tower. Can you stand?\u201d</p><p>He pushed himself to his feet, waiting for the kid to join him, but he found himself waiting a second too long. A glance to where Peter remained on the floor explained why.</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes looked desperate, lost, as they drifted over the scene before him. The fire, the overturned cars-</p><p>Tony himself had to choke back a sob.</p><p>The bodies in the front seats.</p><p>And the three in the back.</p><p>\u201cKid, don\u2019t look.\u201d His voice came out weak, quivering, because it was too little, too late. Peter had already seen the damage, and no matter what Tony did, he could never remove those horrors from his kid\u2019s mind.</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Tony urged his voice to come out stronger, more in control, as his two metal-clad hands gripped Peter\u2019s shoulders and forced them away from the wreckage. Peter fought him at first, but then allowed himself to be turned.</p><p>Allowed Tony to see the raw <i>emotion </i>on his face.</p><p>His eyes were red with unshed tears, but they weren\u2019t sad. No, they were <i>lost</i>. Hopeless. Guilt-ridden. Staring somewhere beyond Tony. Somewhere <i>through </i>him.</p><p>Like he wasn\u2019t even there.</p><p>Tony gripped his shoulder a bit tighter, essentially holding the kid up.</p><p>\u201cPete. Hey, look at me.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, hesitantly, the kid\u2019s eyes lolled their way up to find Tony\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cNot your fault.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded slowly, as if he was in a trance. Tony knew he didn\u2019t actually agree. He wouldn\u2019t for a long while, maybe even ever - Tony understood better than most.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go back to the tower?\u201d he murmured gently, offering his arms to Peter and helping him to his feet.</p><p>Tony allowed the kid to curl into his arms as they lifted into the sky, leaving the wreckage behind.</p><ul><li>\u2022 \u2022</li>\n</ul><p>When they touched down at the tower, it took Peter longer than expected to detangle himself from his mentor\u2019s iron-clad arms. He moved slow, sluggish, and Tony\u2019s heart ached as he watched his kid trudge into the tower.</p><p>Tony followed not too far behind, thinking back to his own mistakes, all the times he\u2019d let civilians die. How afterwards he\u2019s had trouble eating, sleeping. The first time he lost a civilian, shot in a shootout Tony was trying to prevent, he considered hanging up the suit altogether.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t.</p><p>And he would make sure Peter wouldn\u2019t, either.</p><p>Take a seat on the couch, Pete,\u201d he spoke softly when he saw Peter standing in the middle of the foyer, looking lost. \u201cYou can even turn on one of those Star Wars movies, if you like. I\u2019ll actually allow you to do it. Take advantage.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded slowly, avoiding eye contact, as he slowly stumbled to the couch and collapsed, gingerly reaching for the remote and beginning to flip through the channels.</p><p>Tony sighed, sending one last look to his kid before jogging up the stairs and returning not two minutes later with a pile of blankets. He didn\u2019t hesitate to recline on the couch beside his kid and wrap him in the fluffiest one, knowing Peter wouldn\u2019t be opposed to the sudden contact.</p><p>But Tony wondered if he even noticed it at all.</p><p>His shoulders remained stiff, eyes focused on what was playing on the t.v., the news-</p><p>The news? But Peter <i>hated </i>the news. All the politics and arguments didn\u2019t sit right with him.</p><p>He was about to speak up when he heard an intake of breath beside him followed by a soft voice.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t hate me.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s breath caught in his throat.</p><p>Peter was shaking where he was huddled on the couch, his eyes not moving from where his knees were tucked to his chest, refusing to look up.</p><p>Tony watched his kid in disbelief, not understanding how Peter could say something so - so <i>stupid</i>. How the <i>heck</i> could Peter ever believe Tony would hate him? That was his <i>kid</i>. Peter could do anything and Tony would support him - even <i>murder</i>. Heck, Tony would help him hide the body.</p><p>With a cringe, Tony realized he had waited too long to answer as Peter\u2019s shuddering grew more violent.</p><p>Tony rested a hand on his shoulder. Peter lightly flinched, but Tony decided not to take it personally when the kid leaned into his touch shortly after.</p><p>\u201cPeter, look at me.\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head.</p><p>Tony gripped his shoulder tighter and forced the kid around to look at him. Tony <i>hated </i>how harsh he was being, but he needed the kid to understand.</p><p>He gently placed two fingers under Peter\u2019s chin and lifted his face until Peter\u2019s large, watering brown eyes met Tony\u2019s own.</p><p>\u201cListen to me.\u201d There was more passion in his voice than he had expected, but he wasn\u2019t surprised. Tony would <i>kill </i>for Peter.</p><p>\u201cI will never, <i>ever</i>, hate you, you hear me? No matter what happens, I know the real you. I know you would never do anything to warrant my-\u201d Tony had trouble even getting the word out. \u201c-my <i>hatred</i>!\u201d</p><p>Peter still looked unsure as he fidgeted him hands in his lap, shifting uncomfortably as his eyes searched the room, chin held tightly in Tony\u2019s grasp.</p><p>\u201cBut you - you have to k-kick me out of the Av-Avengers now.\u201d</p><p>A look of confusion crossed Tony\u2019s features as he fought to not let his fingers clench in anger at how little Peter placed his self-worth.</p><p>He forced his voice to calm as his eyes softened.</p><p>\u201cAnd why would I do that?\u201d</p><p>Peter leaned back to remove his chin from Tony\u2019s grip. Tony complied, letting his hand fall to his lap as Peter looked down, ashamed, his voice deathly quiet.</p><p>\u201cI - I killed-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Tony cut him off with newfound ferocity in his voice, making Peter wince. Screw gentle. Peter needed to understand. Tony <i>desperately</i> needed Peter to understand. \u201cYou did <i>not </i>kill them. Did you crash the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no, but-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you pour out the gasoline?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>No</i>-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you set the fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were <i>kids</i>, Tony!\u201d</p><p>Tony froze at the sudden outburst, Peter\u2019s eyes widening at the use of the name.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Peter rushed to gasp out, but Tony just held up a finger.</p><p>\u201cNo apologizing, kid.\u201d</p><p>Peter paused a moment before letting out a light chuckle, catching the both of them off guard.</p><p>\u201cThat word felt really weird coming out of my mouth.\u201d</p><p>Tony raised his eyebrows before falling into a small fit of laughter himself.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna stick with Mr. Stark.\u201d Tony nodded, appreciating the opportunity for humour, the chance to laugh with his kid again.</p><p>But the dark, haunted look that returned to cloud Peter\u2019s sullen eyes reminded Tony of the underlying threat still at hand.</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Tony called the kid\u2019s attention back to him. \u201cJust answer this for me. What more could you have done to save them?\u201d</p><p>Peter hesitated for a moment, looking lost; then-</p><p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t taken so long to get my stuff out of my locker after school, maybe I would\u2019ve been on that corner before it happened. I could\u2019ve stopped it.\u201d</p><p>Tony watched his kid with pity. This was the worst part of any mission - the \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d. What if I had moved a bit faster? What if I had turned left rather than right?</p><p>But Tony had enough experience to know that there would always be \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d. Things would always go wrong. It was how you dealt with it that mattered.</p><p>\u201cI need you to listen to me, kid.\u201d Peter looked up at Tony with wide, watering eyes, giving him a look that made Tony want to lock the doors and separate them from the outside world. Just the two of them, safe and protected forever.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t hide himself, and neither could Peter. They had to deal with this, to fight it. Tony would make sure Peter knew he was loved. He was <i>appreciated</i>. That never in a million years would he be <i>hated</i>.</p><p>\u201cThis was not your fault. No interrupting.\u201d Tony held up a finger when Peter opened his mouth, and he closed it again dejectedly. \u201cYou can\u2019t save everyone, kid, no matter how hard you try. And it\u2019s gonna suck. After an event like this, you\u2019re gonna want to hang up your suit. Stop fighting.\u201d Peter looked down at his lap, ashamed, and Tony guessed he had hit the nail on the head.</p><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t. This happens to everyone, kid. Happened to me.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes flashed up in shock, and Tony chuckled humorlessly at the response.</p><p>\u201cYeah, kid, even Iron Man can\u2019t save everyone. Goodness knows I tried.\u201d</p><p>It was quiet for a minute, until Peter whispered a quiet, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Tony focused straight ahead, thinking back to the one memory that would haunt him every time he put on the suit. It had been a while ago, but he still hadn\u2019t quite forgiven himself yet. Ironic, then, that he was teaching Peter to move on. Tony just hoped that Peter could be better than he himself ever was.</p><p>\u201cIt was one of my first times wearing the suit,\u201d Tony started, staring somewhere into the distance. Peter waited quietly.</p><p>\u201cI was just flying over the city, testing out my thrusters, when I heard screaming. It was a man, with a gun, in the middle of an intersection. So I touched down and raised my thruster-\u201d</p><p>Peter clutched a hand to his mouth with a gasp. Tony looked up suddenly, realizing what it must\u2019ve sounded like.</p><p>\u201cNo, kid, geez, no, I didn\u2019t shoot him.\u201d Peter seemed to relax, but Tony inwardly cursed himself. Tony was finally proving to be the terrible monster Peter had always been too innocent to notice.</p><p>\u201cBut that was part of the problem. See, I waited too long, said some smart-ass comment-\u201d Tony sighed as he ran a hand down his face to pinch the bridge of his nose. The memory still haunted him, the look on the girl\u2019s face clear as day.</p><p>\u201cHe aimed the gun and shot it and it - it hit-\u201d</p><p>Tony cut himself off, not being able to continue. The memories were just too strong.</p><p>Tony was started by Peter moving on the couch to sit closer to his mentor, his small frame providing an insurmountable amount of comfort to the mechanic as Tony wrapped his arm around his kid and held him close.</p><p>\u201cIt was a young girl,\u201d Tony found the strength to continue, though he knew that when he finished, Peter would never look at him the same way. He guessed it was for the best, though - Tony needed to put as much distance between the two of them as possible. As much as he loved the kid, If he continued to hang around Tony, he would get hurt, or worse. The story just helped prove that.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t have been older than five. And you want to hear what she said to bring the gunman\u2019s attention to her?\u201d</p><p>Tony blinked the tears from his eyes as the words, the voice, replayed themselves in his mind, clear as day. They were the sounds that had haunted him for the longest time, and would continue to until - well, Tony didn\u2019t know how long it would be until he forgot. Maybe never. And honestly, he didn\u2019t even know if he <i>wanted </i>to forget. He was responsible for that girl\u2019s death. He had no right to a clear conscience.</p><p>\u201cShe said, \u2018Look, mom, it\u2019s Iron Man. He\u2019ll save us.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Tony felt Peter tense in his side but tried to cherish the feeling of his kid leaning against him, realizing it might be the last time Peter would ever want to be close to him.</p><p><i>Seems about right</i>, he thought as he hastily wiped away a tear he hadn\u2019t even realized had fallen. <i>Now Peter realizes what a monster I am. I\u2019m not a hero, I\u2019m-</i></p><p>Suddenly, Peter was wrapping his arms around his mentor, resting his chin on his shoulder as Tony looked down at him in surprise.</p><p>\u201cKid, what-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot your fault.\u201d</p><p>Tony stared down at the matted curls of his kid incredulously. Why was Peter hugging him? He had killed a five-year-old-</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Geez</i>, kid, can you read minds or something?\u201d Tony gasped, but Peter just held him tighter. Tony rested a light hand on Peter\u2019s head, fingers threading through his soft curls.</p><p>\u201cDid you aim the gun at her?\u201d</p><p>Tony chuckled at the irony and couldn\u2019t held smiling at how <i>selfless </i>the kid was.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you pull the trigger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Did </i>you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Peter sat back up like that decided it.</p><p>\u201cThen you didn\u2019t kill her.\u201d</p><p>Tony sighed quietly as he leaned back into the couch cushions.</p><p>\u201cStill hurts.\u201d</p><p>Peter mirrored his position.</p><p>\u201cSo this feeling will never go away, then?\u201d</p><p>Tony turned his gaze to the kid and saw his brown eyes looking back sadly. Tony shook his head slightly.</p><p>\u201cNo, but you can try to move on.\u201d He spoke stronger, as if he really believed in what he was saying. For Peter\u2019s sake, at least. \u201cTry to continue saving people. Being a hero isn\u2019t the mistakes you didn\u2019t make; it\u2019s coming back from the ones you did.\u201d</p><p>Peter smiled then, but Tony could still see the brokenness behind it. He figured he would for a while. He would help him, though. He would save Peter, help him get back on his feet.</p><p>And he would never leave him. No, Peter was his kid.</p><p>Maybe that was selfish. Maybe Tony\u2019s self-destructive tendencies would rub off on the kid - maybe something worse would. Tony didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Peter was his kid, and Tony would never leave him.</p></p>",

An oblivious new young driver ran a stop sign, or someone checked their phone while behind the wheel, and the car swerved to the next lane over.</p><p>The injuries were generally the same - minor cuts or bruises, or, on the more severe end of the spectrum, a concussion. On any other day, Peter would arrive at the scene, help people out of the cars, wait for the authorities to arrive, and swing off again.</p><p>This was not any other day.</p>[[MORE]]<p>After swinging around the final corner, Peter almost fell when he saw the scene before him.</p><p>One of the vehicles, a shiny new sports car, lay on its side as smoke billowed from the hood. A tire was rolling lazily away from the vehicle as the surrounding cars had formed a ring-like space around it, all swerving to avoid the catastrophe.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t what concerned Peter the most.</p><p>In front of the overturned car, having plowed into the brick wall of a shoe store, was a minivan, the bumper sticker of a mother, father, and three baby girls on the back window.</p><p>The minivan had hit the wall hard enough to leave a dent, dust beginning to rise from the settling brick. The entire right side of the vehicle was pressed against the wall, parts of it dented and crumpled from the pure force of the impact.</p><p>Peter tried to shake off the hollow feeling of dread in his stomach as he shook his head and swung into action.</p><p>He went first for the minivan, the three smiling stick figures of children seeming to taunt Peter as he brought himself down in the middle of the street, quickly running the final steps to the red van.</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Peter jumped at the sudden reminder of Karen. \u201cDo you require my assistance?\u201d</p><p>Peter found his head spinning. Why - why couldn\u2019t he focus? He was <i>Spiderman</i>. He had rescued people from car crashes before. He could do this.</p><p>\u201cY-yeah, Karen.\u201d He hated how young his voice shouted.</p><p>\u201cBefore we begin, there is gasoline dripping from the vehicle behind you. It may light soon.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s breath quickened. \u201cLet\u2019s make this fast, then.\u201d He reassessed the vehicle in front of him, fighting to keep his breathing steady. \u201cWhere\u2019s my best point of entry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDriver\u2019s side door is the only one not tainted by rubble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Karen.\u201d</p><p>Peter reached out a shaking hand <i>(why was it shaking?)</i> and gripped the handle, easily pulling it open with his extra strength. Spoke billowed out but his mask stopped him from squinting against it. And when it cleared\u2026.</p><p>He expected crying.</p><p>Screaming.</p><p>Pleads for help.</p><p>He didn\u2019t expect <i>silence</i>.</p><p>Peter\u2019s heart beat faster, blocking out the noises of the oncoming sirens. <i>Were they even still there? Was help ever coming?</i></p><p>\u201cPeter, a small fire has started in the engine of the vehicle behind you.\u201d Karen\u2019s soft voice interrupted his thoughts, but at the moment even the gentle AI couldn\u2019t snap him out of his predicament. Peter ignored her and instead asked his own question, focusing on the slumped-over man behind the wheel, not being able to take his eyes off where the man\u2019s eyes were - were rolled back in his-</p><p>\u201cKaren, read his vitals.\u201d</p><p>His heart pounded in his throat as he assessed the pale face and the blood dripping down the various wounds of the man before him. The airbag was deployed but it was tinted - it was tinted <i>red</i>-</p><p>\u201cDead. No vitals.\u201d</p><p>Peter felt like he was going to throw up.</p><p>\u201cPeter, the fire is spreading dangerously close to the gasoline-\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead the woman\u2019s vitals,\u201d he ignored her, finding the mother in the passenger seat.</p><p>His limbs felt like lead, and he wasn\u2019t sure how long he stood there, waiting for Karen\u2019s response.</p><p>Could\u2019ve been days.</p><p>Could\u2019ve been mere seconds.</p><p>It didn\u2019t change her answer.</p><p>\u201cDead. No vitals.\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head.</p><p>Spiderman.</p><p><i>He was Spiderman.</i></p><p>Focus.</p><p>\u201cPeter, the flame-\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaren,\u201d he choked out. He had to save them. He was Spiderman; he <i>had </i>to save them.</p><p>\u201cCheck for heat signatures in the back.\u201d</p><p>Maybe the stickers were left on the van from the last owner. Maybe there weren\u2019t any kids <i>in </i>the van-</p><p>\u201cThree heat signatures detected.\u201d</p><p>Peter fought to move, to see them, to open the door to the back seat and help the children out - children. There were <i>children </i>back there.</p><p>But all he could do was gasp out, \u201cRead vitals.\u201d</p><p>Everything went quiet.</p><p>Still.</p><p>Silent.</p><p>The world itself seemed to stop spinning as Peter awaited the response.</p><p>\u201cAll dead. No vitals.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s brain shut down.</p><p>Then, it went into hyperdrive.</p><p>Peter\u2019s breath quickened as he backed away - <i>stumbled </i>away from the car, staggering as he clutched a hand to his chest. He couldn\u2019t breathe, <i>couldn\u2019t breathe-</i></p><p>\u201cPeter, you have to leave <i>now</i>. The car is about to explode.\u201d</p><p>Peter just shook his head and fell to his knees as his ears altered between hearing everything, and hearing nothing.</p><p>He was Spiderman. He should have the strength to get up and save himself.</p><p><i>But was it worth it, if everyone else was dead?</i></p><p>Suddenly, a force hit Peter from behind, and he went flying.</p><ul><li>\u2022 \u2022</li>\n</ul><p>\u201cPeter? Pete! You gotta get up, bud.\u201d A shiver of dread raced up Tony\u2019s spine as he watched the boy lying limp on the pavement, the fire behind him being put out by firemen.</p><p>He had been notified as soon as Peter went unconscious by Karen. Already, he was planning 20 different changes he could make to the suit to better protect Peter. To notify Tony <i>before </i>his kid went unconscious.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t matter now. All that did was that Peter was <i>still </i>unresponsive.</p><p>As soon as Tony was notified of Peter\u2019s condition, he raced to suit up and fly to his location, only keeping the suit on once he landed long enough to hear F.R.I.D.A.Y. tell him Peter was alive and in stable condition, before disengaging it and racing, as nothing more than Tony Stark, to the kid\u2019s side. Still, Tony couldn\u2019t stop the anxious thoughts racing through his mind, mainly revolving around the suit.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t Karen warn Peter when he was in danger? What had Tony done wrong with the programming of the suit?</p><p>How had he failed his kid so terribly?</p><p>The thoughts were quickly erased from his mind when a groan was emitted from the body on the floor.</p><p>\u201cPeter? You with me?\u201d</p><p>The boy\u2019s eyes fluttered open, Tony removing his mask just enough to see his face, but using Tony\u2019s own body to shield him from the crowd forming not far from the two. Tony knew he had to get the kid out of there. Iron Man and Spiderman crouched beside a still-smoking car crash? The news reports would be brutal.</p><p>Still, he wanted to be absolutely positive Peter was okay before moving him.</p><p>\u201cMis\u2019r S\u2019ark,\u201d Peter mumbled groggily, mouth full of cotton. Tony sighed as he momentarily rested back on his heels. He ran a hand over his forehead, stopping at the bridge of his nose as his heartbeat slowed significantly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving my gray hairs, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018M sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize.\u201d</p><p>Tony gently readjusted the kid\u2019s mask so it covered his face once more, promising himself to take it off as soon as the cameras people had begin to point their way were out of sight. His chest panged when Peter\u2019s large brown eyes left his sight, and he desperately wanted to keep the mask off and just keep looking into them to assure himself that <i>Peter was okay</i>, but he knew the last thing the kid would want was others knowing his identity.</p><p>So he kept the mask on.</p><p>Tony called his suit back to him as soon as he had convinced himself Peter was alright. \u201cCome on kid, let\u2019s go back to the tower. Can you stand?\u201d</p><p>He pushed himself to his feet, waiting for the kid to join him, but he found himself waiting a second too long. A glance to where Peter remained on the floor explained why.</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes looked desperate, lost, as they drifted over the scene before him. The fire, the overturned cars-</p><p>Tony himself had to choke back a sob.</p><p>The bodies in the front seats.</p><p>And the three in the back.</p><p>\u201cKid, don\u2019t look.\u201d His voice came out weak, quivering, because it was too little, too late. Peter had already seen the damage, and no matter what Tony did, he could never remove those horrors from his kid\u2019s mind.</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Tony urged his voice to come out stronger, more in control, as his two metal-clad hands gripped Peter\u2019s shoulders and forced them away from the wreckage. Peter fought him at first, but then allowed himself to be turned.</p><p>Allowed Tony to see the raw <i>emotion </i>on his face.</p><p>His eyes were red with unshed tears, but they weren\u2019t sad. No, they were <i>lost</i>. Hopeless. Guilt-ridden. Staring somewhere beyond Tony. Somewhere <i>through </i>him.</p><p>Like he wasn\u2019t even there.</p><p>Tony gripped his shoulder a bit tighter, essentially holding the kid up.</p><p>\u201cPete. Hey, look at me.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, hesitantly, the kid\u2019s eyes lolled their way up to find Tony\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cNot your fault.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded slowly, as if he was in a trance. Tony knew he didn\u2019t actually agree. He wouldn\u2019t for a long while, maybe even ever - Tony understood better than most.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go back to the tower?\u201d he murmured gently, offering his arms to Peter and helping him to his feet.</p><p>Tony allowed the kid to curl into his arms as they lifted into the sky, leaving the wreckage behind.</p><ul><li>\u2022 \u2022</li>\n</ul><p>When they touched down at the tower, it took Peter longer than expected to detangle himself from his mentor\u2019s iron-clad arms. He moved slow, sluggish, and Tony\u2019s heart ached as he watched his kid trudge into the tower.</p><p>Tony followed not too far behind, thinking back to his own mistakes, all the times he\u2019d let civilians die. How afterwards he\u2019s had trouble eating, sleeping. The first time he lost a civilian, shot in a shootout Tony was trying to prevent, he considered hanging up the suit altogether.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t.</p><p>And he would make sure Peter wouldn\u2019t, either.</p><p>Take a seat on the couch, Pete,\u201d he spoke softly when he saw Peter standing in the middle of the foyer, looking lost. \u201cYou can even turn on one of those Star Wars movies, if you like. I\u2019ll actually allow you to do it. Take advantage.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded slowly, avoiding eye contact, as he slowly stumbled to the couch and collapsed, gingerly reaching for the remote and beginning to flip through the channels.</p><p>Tony sighed, sending one last look to his kid before jogging up the stairs and returning not two minutes later with a pile of blankets. He didn\u2019t hesitate to recline on the couch beside his kid and wrap him in the fluffiest one, knowing Peter wouldn\u2019t be opposed to the sudden contact.</p><p>But Tony wondered if he even noticed it at all.</p><p>His shoulders remained stiff, eyes focused on what was playing on the t.v., the news-</p><p>The news? But Peter <i>hated </i>the news. All the politics and arguments didn\u2019t sit right with him.</p><p>He was about to speak up when he heard an intake of breath beside him followed by a soft voice.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t hate me.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s breath caught in his throat.</p><p>Peter was shaking where he was huddled on the couch, his eyes not moving from where his knees were tucked to his chest, refusing to look up.</p><p>Tony watched his kid in disbelief, not understanding how Peter could say something so - so <i>stupid</i>. How the <i>heck</i> could Peter ever believe Tony would hate him? That was his <i>kid</i>. Peter could do anything and Tony would support him - even <i>murder</i>. Heck, Tony would help him hide the body.</p><p>With a cringe, Tony realized he had waited too long to answer as Peter\u2019s shuddering grew more violent.</p><p>Tony rested a hand on his shoulder. Peter lightly flinched, but Tony decided not to take it personally when the kid leaned into his touch shortly after.</p><p>\u201cPeter, look at me.\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head.</p><p>Tony gripped his shoulder tighter and forced the kid around to look at him. Tony <i>hated </i>how harsh he was being, but he needed the kid to understand.</p><p>He gently placed two fingers under Peter\u2019s chin and lifted his face until Peter\u2019s large, watering brown eyes met Tony\u2019s own.</p><p>\u201cListen to me.\u201d There was more passion in his voice than he had expected, but he wasn\u2019t surprised. Tony would <i>kill </i>for Peter.</p><p>\u201cI will never, <i>ever</i>, hate you, you hear me? No matter what happens, I know the real you. I know you would never do anything to warrant my-\u201d Tony had trouble even getting the word out. \u201c-my <i>hatred</i>!\u201d</p><p>Peter still looked unsure as he fidgeted him hands in his lap, shifting uncomfortably as his eyes searched the room, chin held tightly in Tony\u2019s grasp.</p><p>\u201cBut you - you have to k-kick me out of the Av-Avengers now.\u201d</p><p>A look of confusion crossed Tony\u2019s features as he fought to not let his fingers clench in anger at how little Peter placed his self-worth.</p><p>He forced his voice to calm as his eyes softened.</p><p>\u201cAnd why would I do that?\u201d</p><p>Peter leaned back to remove his chin from Tony\u2019s grip. Tony complied, letting his hand fall to his lap as Peter looked down, ashamed, his voice deathly quiet.</p><p>\u201cI - I killed-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Tony cut him off with newfound ferocity in his voice, making Peter wince. Screw gentle. Peter needed to understand. Tony <i>desperately</i> needed Peter to understand. \u201cYou did <i>not </i>kill them. Did you crash the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no, but-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you pour out the gasoline?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>No</i>-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you set the fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were <i>kids</i>, Tony!\u201d</p><p>Tony froze at the sudden outburst, Peter\u2019s eyes widening at the use of the name.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Peter rushed to gasp out, but Tony just held up a finger.</p><p>\u201cNo apologizing, kid.\u201d</p><p>Peter paused a moment before letting out a light chuckle, catching the both of them off guard.</p><p>\u201cThat word felt really weird coming out of my mouth.\u201d</p><p>Tony raised his eyebrows before falling into a small fit of laughter himself.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna stick with Mr. Stark.\u201d Tony nodded, appreciating the opportunity for humour, the chance to laugh with his kid again.</p><p>But the dark, haunted look that returned to cloud Peter\u2019s sullen eyes reminded Tony of the underlying threat still at hand.</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Tony called the kid\u2019s attention back to him. \u201cJust answer this for me. What more could you have done to save them?\u201d</p><p>Peter hesitated for a moment, looking lost; then-</p><p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t taken so long to get my stuff out of my locker after school, maybe I would\u2019ve been on that corner before it happened. I could\u2019ve stopped it.\u201d</p><p>Tony watched his kid with pity. This was the worst part of any mission - the \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d. What if I had moved a bit faster? What if I had turned left rather than right?</p><p>But Tony had enough experience to know that there would always be \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d. Things would always go wrong. It was how you dealt with it that mattered.</p><p>\u201cI need you to listen to me, kid.\u201d Peter looked up at Tony with wide, watering eyes, giving him a look that made Tony want to lock the doors and separate them from the outside world. Just the two of them, safe and protected forever.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t hide himself, and neither could Peter. They had to deal with this, to fight it. Tony would make sure Peter knew he was loved. He was <i>appreciated</i>. That never in a million years would he be <i>hated</i>.</p><p>\u201cThis was not your fault. No interrupting.\u201d Tony held up a finger when Peter opened his mouth, and he closed it again dejectedly. \u201cYou can\u2019t save everyone, kid, no matter how hard you try. And it\u2019s gonna suck. After an event like this, you\u2019re gonna want to hang up your suit. Stop fighting.\u201d Peter looked down at his lap, ashamed, and Tony guessed he had hit the nail on the head.</p><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t. This happens to everyone, kid. Happened to me.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes flashed up in shock, and Tony chuckled humorlessly at the response.</p><p>\u201cYeah, kid, even Iron Man can\u2019t save everyone. Goodness knows I tried.\u201d</p><p>It was quiet for a minute, until Peter whispered a quiet, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Tony focused straight ahead, thinking back to the one memory that would haunt him every time he put on the suit. It had been a while ago, but he still hadn\u2019t quite forgiven himself yet. Ironic, then, that he was teaching Peter to move on. Tony just hoped that Peter could be better than he himself ever was.</p><p>\u201cIt was one of my first times wearing the suit,\u201d Tony started, staring somewhere into the distance. Peter waited quietly.</p><p>\u201cI was just flying over the city, testing out my thrusters, when I heard screaming. It was a man, with a gun, in the middle of an intersection. So I touched down and raised my thruster-\u201d</p><p>Peter clutched a hand to his mouth with a gasp. Tony looked up suddenly, realizing what it must\u2019ve sounded like.</p><p>\u201cNo, kid, geez, no, I didn\u2019t shoot him.\u201d Peter seemed to relax, but Tony inwardly cursed himself. Tony was finally proving to be the terrible monster Peter had always been too innocent to notice.</p><p>\u201cBut that was part of the problem. See, I waited too long, said some smart-ass comment-\u201d Tony sighed as he ran a hand down his face to pinch the bridge of his nose. The memory still haunted him, the look on the girl\u2019s face clear as day.</p><p>\u201cHe aimed the gun and shot it and it - it hit-\u201d</p><p>Tony cut himself off, not being able to continue. The memories were just too strong.</p><p>Tony was started by Peter moving on the couch to sit closer to his mentor, his small frame providing an insurmountable amount of comfort to the mechanic as Tony wrapped his arm around his kid and held him close.</p><p>\u201cIt was a young girl,\u201d Tony found the strength to continue, though he knew that when he finished, Peter would never look at him the same way. He guessed it was for the best, though - Tony needed to put as much distance between the two of them as possible. As much as he loved the kid, If he continued to hang around Tony, he would get hurt, or worse. The story just helped prove that.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t have been older than five. And you want to hear what she said to bring the gunman\u2019s attention to her?\u201d</p><p>Tony blinked the tears from his eyes as the words, the voice, replayed themselves in his mind, clear as day. They were the sounds that had haunted him for the longest time, and would continue to until - well, Tony didn\u2019t know how long it would be until he forgot. Maybe never. And honestly, he didn\u2019t even know if he <i>wanted </i>to forget. He was responsible for that girl\u2019s death. He had no right to a clear conscience.</p><p>\u201cShe said, \u2018Look, mom, it\u2019s Iron Man. He\u2019ll save us.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Tony felt Peter tense in his side but tried to cherish the feeling of his kid leaning against him, realizing it might be the last time Peter would ever want to be close to him.</p><p><i>Seems about right</i>, he thought as he hastily wiped away a tear he hadn\u2019t even realized had fallen. <i>Now Peter realizes what a monster I am. I\u2019m not a hero, I\u2019m-</i></p><p>Suddenly, Peter was wrapping his arms around his mentor, resting his chin on his shoulder as Tony looked down at him in surprise.</p><p>\u201cKid, what-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot your fault.\u201d</p><p>Tony stared down at the matted curls of his kid incredulously. Why was Peter hugging him? He had killed a five-year-old-</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Geez</i>, kid, can you read minds or something?\u201d Tony gasped, but Peter just held him tighter. Tony rested a light hand on Peter\u2019s head, fingers threading through his soft curls.</p><p>\u201cDid you aim the gun at her?\u201d</p><p>Tony chuckled at the irony and couldn\u2019t held smiling at how <i>selfless </i>the kid was.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you pull the trigger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Did </i>you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Peter sat back up like that decided it.</p><p>\u201cThen you didn\u2019t kill her.\u201d</p><p>Tony sighed quietly as he leaned back into the couch cushions.</p><p>\u201cStill hurts.\u201d</p><p>Peter mirrored his position.</p><p>\u201cSo this feeling will never go away, then?\u201d</p><p>Tony turned his gaze to the kid and saw his brown eyes looking back sadly. Tony shook his head slightly.</p><p>\u201cNo, but you can try to move on.\u201d He spoke stronger, as if he really believed in what he was saying. For Peter\u2019s sake, at least. \u201cTry to continue saving people. Being a hero isn\u2019t the mistakes you didn\u2019t make; it\u2019s coming back from the ones you did.\u201d</p><p>Peter smiled then, but Tony could still see the brokenness behind it. He figured he would for a while. He would help him, though. He would save Peter, help him get back on his feet.</p><p>And he would never leave him. No, Peter was his kid.</p><p>Maybe that was selfish. Maybe Tony\u2019s self-destructive tendencies would rub off on the kid - maybe something worse would. Tony didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Peter was his kid, and Tony would never leave him.</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h2><b>Irondad || Angst &amp; Comfort || WC: 3.6k</b></h2><p>Peter was patrolling 14th Street when he heard a loud BANG, followed by the unmistakable tire squeal of a car veering off the road.<br /></p><p>He immediately swung into action, ricocheting off and around buildings to where he heard the noise.</p><p>Peter had dealt with car crashes before. An oblivious new young driver ran a stop sign, or someone checked their phone while behind the wheel, and the car swerved to the next lane over.</p><p>The injuries were generally the same - minor cuts or bruises, or, on the more severe end of the spectrum, a concussion. On any other day, Peter would arrive at the scene, help people out of the cars, wait for the authorities to arrive, and swing off again.</p><p>This was not any other day.</p><p>After swinging around the final corner, Peter almost fell when he saw the scene before him.</p><p>One of the vehicles, a shiny new sports car, lay on its side as smoke billowed from the hood. A tire was rolling lazily away from the vehicle as the surrounding cars had formed a ring-like space around it, all swerving to avoid the catastrophe.</p><p>But that wasn&rsquo;t what concerned Peter the most.</p><p>In front of the overturned car, having plowed into the brick wall of a shoe store, was a minivan, the bumper sticker of a mother, father, and three baby girls on the back window.</p><p>The minivan had hit the wall hard enough to leave a dent, dust beginning to rise from the settling brick. The entire right side of the vehicle was pressed against the wall, parts of it dented and crumpled from the pure force of the impact.</p><p>Peter tried to shake off the hollow feeling of dread in his stomach as he shook his head and swung into action.</p><p>He went first for the minivan, the three smiling stick figures of children seeming to taunt Peter as he brought himself down in the middle of the street, quickly running the final steps to the red van.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter.&rdquo; Peter jumped at the sudden reminder of Karen. &ldquo;Do you require my assistance?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter found his head spinning. Why - why couldn&rsquo;t he focus? He was <i>Spiderman</i>. He had rescued people from car crashes before. He could do this.</p><p>&ldquo;Y-yeah, Karen.&rdquo; He hated how young his voice shouted.</p><p>&ldquo;Before we begin, there is gasoline dripping from the vehicle behind you. It may light soon.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s breath quickened. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make this fast, then.&rdquo; He reassessed the vehicle in front of him, fighting to keep his breathing steady. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my best point of entry?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Driver&rsquo;s side door is the only one not tainted by rubble.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, Karen.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter reached out a shaking hand <i>(why was it shaking?)</i> and gripped the handle, easily pulling it open with his extra strength. Spoke billowed out but his mask stopped him from squinting against it. And when it cleared&hellip;.</p><p>He expected crying.</p><p>Screaming.</p><p>Pleads for help.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t expect <i>silence</i>.</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s heart beat faster, blocking out the noises of the oncoming sirens. <i>Were they even still there? Was help ever coming?</i></p><p>&ldquo;Peter, a small fire has started in the engine of the vehicle behind you.&rdquo; Karen&rsquo;s soft voice interrupted his thoughts, but at the moment even the gentle AI couldn&rsquo;t snap him out of his predicament. Peter ignored her and instead asked his own question, focusing on the slumped-over man behind the wheel, not being able to take his eyes off where the man&rsquo;s eyes were - were rolled back in his-</p><p>&ldquo;Karen, read his vitals.&rdquo;</p><p>His heart pounded in his throat as he assessed the pale face and the blood dripping down the various wounds of the man before him. The airbag was deployed but it was tinted - it was tinted <i>red</i>-</p><p>&ldquo;Dead. No vitals.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter felt like he was going to throw up.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, the fire is spreading dangerously close to the gasoline-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Read the woman&rsquo;s vitals,&rdquo; he ignored her, finding the mother in the passenger seat.</p><p>His limbs felt like lead, and he wasn&rsquo;t sure how long he stood there, waiting for Karen&rsquo;s response.</p><p>Could&rsquo;ve been days.</p><p>Could&rsquo;ve been mere seconds.</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t change her answer.</p><p>&ldquo;Dead. No vitals.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shook his head.</p><p>Spiderman.</p><p><i>He was Spiderman.</i></p><p>Focus.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, the flame-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Karen,&rdquo; he choked out. He had to save them. He was Spiderman; he <i>had </i>to save them.</p><p>&ldquo;Check for heat signatures in the back.&rdquo;</p><p>Maybe the stickers were left on the van from the last owner. Maybe there weren&rsquo;t any kids <i>in </i>the van-</p><p>&ldquo;Three heat signatures detected.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter fought to move, to see them, to open the door to the back seat and help the children out - children. There were <i>children </i>back there.</p><p>But all he could do was gasp out, &ldquo;Read vitals.&rdquo;</p><p>Everything went quiet.</p><p>Still.</p><p>Silent.</p><p>The world itself seemed to stop spinning as Peter awaited the response.</p><p>&ldquo;All dead. No vitals.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s brain shut down.</p><p>Then, it went into hyperdrive.</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s breath quickened as he backed away - <i>stumbled </i>away from the car, staggering as he clutched a hand to his chest. He couldn&rsquo;t breathe, <i>couldn&rsquo;t breathe-</i></p><p>&ldquo;Peter, you have to leave <i>now</i>. The car is about to explode.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter just shook his head and fell to his knees as his ears altered between hearing everything, and hearing nothing.</p><p>He was Spiderman. He should have the strength to get up and save himself.</p><p><i>But was it worth it, if everyone else was dead?</i></p><p>Suddenly, a force hit Peter from behind, and he went flying.</p><ul><li>&bull; &bull;</li>\n</ul><p>&ldquo;Peter? Pete! You gotta get up, bud.&rdquo; A shiver of dread raced up Tony&rsquo;s spine as he watched the boy lying limp on the pavement, the fire behind him being put out by firemen.</p><p>He had been notified as soon as Peter went unconscious by Karen. Already, he was planning 20 different changes he could make to the suit to better protect Peter. To notify Tony <i>before </i>his kid went unconscious.</p><p>But that didn&rsquo;t matter now. All that did was that Peter was <i>still </i>unresponsive.</p><p>As soon as Tony was notified of Peter&rsquo;s condition, he raced to suit up and fly to his location, only keeping the suit on once he landed long enough to hear F.R.I.D.A.Y. tell him Peter was alive and in stable condition, before disengaging it and racing, as nothing more than Tony Stark, to the kid&rsquo;s side. Still, Tony couldn&rsquo;t stop the anxious thoughts racing through his mind, mainly revolving around the suit.</p><p>Why didn&rsquo;t Karen warn Peter when he was in danger? What had Tony done wrong with the programming of the suit?</p><p>How had he failed his kid so terribly?</p><p>The thoughts were quickly erased from his mind when a groan was emitted from the body on the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter? You with me?&rdquo;</p><p>The boy&rsquo;s eyes fluttered open, Tony removing his mask just enough to see his face, but using Tony&rsquo;s own body to shield him from the crowd forming not far from the two. Tony knew he had to get the kid out of there. Iron Man and Spiderman crouched beside a still-smoking car crash? The news reports would be brutal.</p><p>Still, he wanted to be absolutely positive Peter was okay before moving him.</p><p>&ldquo;Mis&rsquo;r S&rsquo;ark,&rdquo; Peter mumbled groggily, mouth full of cotton. Tony sighed as he momentarily rested back on his heels. He ran a hand over his forehead, stopping at the bridge of his nose as his heartbeat slowed significantly.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re giving my gray hairs, kid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;M sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t apologize.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony gently readjusted the kid&rsquo;s mask so it covered his face once more, promising himself to take it off as soon as the cameras people had begin to point their way were out of sight. His chest panged when Peter&rsquo;s large brown eyes left his sight, and he desperately wanted to keep the mask off and just keep looking into them to assure himself that <i>Peter was okay</i>, but he knew the last thing the kid would want was others knowing his identity.</p><p>So he kept the mask on.</p><p>Tony called his suit back to him as soon as he had convinced himself Peter was alright. &ldquo;Come on kid, let&rsquo;s go back to the tower. Can you stand?&rdquo;</p><p>He pushed himself to his feet, waiting for the kid to join him, but he found himself waiting a second too long. A glance to where Peter remained on the floor explained why.</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes looked desperate, lost, as they drifted over the scene before him. The fire, the overturned cars-</p><p>Tony himself had to choke back a sob.</p><p>The bodies in the front seats.</p><p>And the three in the back.</p><p>&ldquo;Kid, don&rsquo;t look.&rdquo; His voice came out weak, quivering, because it was too little, too late. Peter had already seen the damage, and no matter what Tony did, he could never remove those horrors from his kid&rsquo;s mind.</p><p>Peter didn&rsquo;t respond.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter.&rdquo; Tony urged his voice to come out stronger, more in control, as his two metal-clad hands gripped Peter&rsquo;s shoulders and forced them away from the wreckage. Peter fought him at first, but then allowed himself to be turned.</p><p>Allowed Tony to see the raw <i>emotion </i>on his face.</p><p>His eyes were red with unshed tears, but they weren&rsquo;t sad. No, they were <i>lost</i>. Hopeless. Guilt-ridden. Staring somewhere beyond Tony. Somewhere <i>through </i>him.</p><p>Like he wasn&rsquo;t even there.</p><p>Tony gripped his shoulder a bit tighter, essentially holding the kid up.</p><p>&ldquo;Pete. Hey, look at me.&rdquo;</p><p>Slowly, hesitantly, the kid&rsquo;s eyes lolled their way up to find Tony&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;Not your fault.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nodded slowly, as if he was in a trance. Tony knew he didn&rsquo;t actually agree. He wouldn&rsquo;t for a long while, maybe even ever - Tony understood better than most.</p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we go back to the tower?&rdquo; he murmured gently, offering his arms to Peter and helping him to his feet.</p><p>Tony allowed the kid to curl into his arms as they lifted into the sky, leaving the wreckage behind.</p><ul><li>&bull; &bull;</li>\n</ul><p>When they touched down at the tower, it took Peter longer than expected to detangle himself from his mentor&rsquo;s iron-clad arms. He moved slow, sluggish, and Tony&rsquo;s heart ached as he watched his kid trudge into the tower.</p><p>Tony followed not too far behind, thinking back to his own mistakes, all the times he&rsquo;d let civilians die. How afterwards he&rsquo;s had trouble eating, sleeping. The first time he lost a civilian, shot in a shootout Tony was trying to prevent, he considered hanging up the suit altogether.</p><p>But he didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>And he would make sure Peter wouldn&rsquo;t, either.</p><p>Take a seat on the couch, Pete,&rdquo; he spoke softly when he saw Peter standing in the middle of the foyer, looking lost. &ldquo;You can even turn on one of those Star Wars movies, if you like. I&rsquo;ll actually allow you to do it. Take advantage.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nodded slowly, avoiding eye contact, as he slowly stumbled to the couch and collapsed, gingerly reaching for the remote and beginning to flip through the channels.</p><p>Tony sighed, sending one last look to his kid before jogging up the stairs and returning not two minutes later with a pile of blankets. He didn&rsquo;t hesitate to recline on the couch beside his kid and wrap him in the fluffiest one, knowing Peter wouldn&rsquo;t be opposed to the sudden contact.</p><p>But Tony wondered if he even noticed it at all.</p><p>His shoulders remained stiff, eyes focused on what was playing on the t.v., the news-</p><p>The news? But Peter <i>hated </i>the news. All the politics and arguments didn&rsquo;t sit right with him.</p><p>He was about to speak up when he heard an intake of breath beside him followed by a soft voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t hate me.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s breath caught in his throat.</p><p>Peter was shaking where he was huddled on the couch, his eyes not moving from where his knees were tucked to his chest, refusing to look up.</p><p>Tony watched his kid in disbelief, not understanding how Peter could say something so - so <i>stupid</i>. How the <i>heck</i> could Peter ever believe Tony would hate him? That was his <i>kid</i>. Peter could do anything and Tony would support him - even <i>murder</i>. Heck, Tony would help him hide the body.</p><p>With a cringe, Tony realized he had waited too long to answer as Peter&rsquo;s shuddering grew more violent.</p><p>Tony rested a hand on his shoulder. Peter lightly flinched, but Tony decided not to take it personally when the kid leaned into his touch shortly after.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, look at me.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shook his head.</p><p>Tony gripped his shoulder tighter and forced the kid around to look at him. Tony <i>hated </i>how harsh he was being, but he needed the kid to understand.</p><p>He gently placed two fingers under Peter&rsquo;s chin and lifted his face until Peter&rsquo;s large, watering brown eyes met Tony&rsquo;s own.</p><p>&ldquo;Listen to me.&rdquo; There was more passion in his voice than he had expected, but he wasn&rsquo;t surprised. Tony would <i>kill </i>for Peter.</p><p>&ldquo;I will never, <i>ever</i>, hate you, you hear me? No matter what happens, I know the real you. I know you would never do anything to warrant my-&rdquo; Tony had trouble even getting the word out. &ldquo;-my <i>hatred</i>!&rdquo;</p><p>Peter still looked unsure as he fidgeted him hands in his lap, shifting uncomfortably as his eyes searched the room, chin held tightly in Tony&rsquo;s grasp.</p><p>&ldquo;But you - you have to k-kick me out of the Av-Avengers now.&rdquo;</p><p>A look of confusion crossed Tony&rsquo;s features as he fought to not let his fingers clench in anger at how little Peter placed his self-worth.</p><p>He forced his voice to calm as his eyes softened.</p><p>&ldquo;And why would I do that?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter leaned back to remove his chin from Tony&rsquo;s grip. Tony complied, letting his hand fall to his lap as Peter looked down, ashamed, his voice deathly quiet.</p><p>&ldquo;I - I killed-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Tony cut him off with newfound ferocity in his voice, making Peter wince. Screw gentle. Peter needed to understand. Tony <i>desperately</i> needed Peter to understand. &ldquo;You did <i>not </i>kill them. Did you crash the car?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, no, but-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you pour out the gasoline?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>No</i>-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you set the fire?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There were <i>kids</i>, Tony!&rdquo;</p><p>Tony froze at the sudden outburst, Peter&rsquo;s eyes widening at the use of the name.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Peter rushed to gasp out, but Tony just held up a finger.</p><p>&ldquo;No apologizing, kid.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter paused a moment before letting out a light chuckle, catching the both of them off guard.</p><p>&ldquo;That word felt really weird coming out of my mouth.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony raised his eyebrows before falling into a small fit of laughter himself.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m gonna stick with Mr. Stark.&rdquo; Tony nodded, appreciating the opportunity for humour, the chance to laugh with his kid again.</p><p>But the dark, haunted look that returned to cloud Peter&rsquo;s sullen eyes reminded Tony of the underlying threat still at hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter.&rdquo; Tony called the kid&rsquo;s attention back to him. &ldquo;Just answer this for me. What more could you have done to save them?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter hesitated for a moment, looking lost; then-</p><p>&ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t taken so long to get my stuff out of my locker after school, maybe I would&rsquo;ve been on that corner before it happened. I could&rsquo;ve stopped it.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony watched his kid with pity. This was the worst part of any mission - the &ldquo;what-ifs&rdquo;. What if I had moved a bit faster? What if I had turned left rather than right?</p><p>But Tony had enough experience to know that there would always be &ldquo;what-ifs&rdquo;. Things would always go wrong. It was how you dealt with it that mattered.</p><p>&ldquo;I need you to listen to me, kid.&rdquo; Peter looked up at Tony with wide, watering eyes, giving him a look that made Tony want to lock the doors and separate them from the outside world. Just the two of them, safe and protected forever.</p><p>But he couldn&rsquo;t. He couldn&rsquo;t hide himself, and neither could Peter. They had to deal with this, to fight it. Tony would make sure Peter knew he was loved. He was <i>appreciated</i>. That never in a million years would he be <i>hated</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;This was not your fault.

And it&rsquo;s gonna suck. After an event like this, you&rsquo;re gonna want to hang up your suit. Stop fighting.&rdquo; Peter looked down at his lap, ashamed, and Tony guessed he had hit the nail on the head.</p><p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t. This happens to everyone, kid. Happened to me.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes flashed up in shock, and Tony chuckled humorlessly at the response.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, kid, even Iron Man can&rsquo;t save everyone. Goodness knows I tried.&rdquo;</p><p>It was quiet for a minute, until Peter whispered a quiet, &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony focused straight ahead, thinking back to the one memory that would haunt him every time he put on the suit. It had been a while ago, but he still hadn&rsquo;t quite forgiven himself yet. Ironic, then, that he was teaching Peter to move on.

The memory still haunted him, the look on the girl&rsquo;s face clear as day.</p><p>&ldquo;He aimed the gun and shot it and it - it hit-&rdquo;</p><p>Tony cut himself off, not being able to continue. The memories were just too strong.</p><p>Tony was started by Peter moving on the couch to sit closer to his mentor, his small frame providing an insurmountable amount of comfort to the mechanic as Tony wrapped his arm around his kid and held him close.</p><p>&ldquo;It was a young girl,&rdquo; Tony found the strength to continue, though he knew that when he finished, Peter would never look at him the same way. He guessed it was for the best, though - Tony needed to put as much distance between the two of them as possible. As much as he loved the kid, If he continued to hang around Tony, he would get hurt, or worse. The story just helped prove that.</p><p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t have been older than five. And you want to hear what she said to bring the gunman&rsquo;s attention to her?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony blinked the tears from his eyes as the words, the voice, replayed themselves in his mind, clear as day. They were the sounds that had haunted him for the longest time, and would continue to until - well, Tony didn&rsquo;t know how long it would be until he forgot. Maybe never. And honestly, he didn&rsquo;t even know if he <i>wanted </i>to forget. He was responsible for that girl&rsquo;s death. He had no right to a clear conscience.</p><p>&ldquo;She said, &lsquo;Look, mom, it&rsquo;s Iron Man. He&rsquo;ll save us.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Tony felt Peter tense in his side but tried to cherish the feeling of his kid leaning against him, realizing it might be the last time Peter would ever want to be close to him.</p><p><i>Seems about right</i>, he thought as he hastily wiped away a tear he hadn&rsquo;t even realized had fallen. <i>Now Peter realizes what a monster I am. I&rsquo;m not a hero, I&rsquo;m-</i></p><p>Suddenly, Peter was wrapping his arms around his mentor, resting his chin on his shoulder as Tony looked down at him in surprise.</p><p>&ldquo;Kid, what-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not your fault.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony stared down at the matted curls of his kid incredulously. Why was Peter hugging him? He had killed a five-year-old-</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t kill her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Geez</i>, kid, can you read minds or something?&rdquo; Tony gasped, but Peter just held him tighter. Tony rested a light hand on Peter&rsquo;s head, fingers threading through his soft curls.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you aim the gun at her?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony chuckled at the irony and couldn&rsquo;t held smiling at how <i>selfless </i>the kid was.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you pull the trigger?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, kid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Did </i>you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter sat back up like that decided it.</p><p>&ldquo;Then you didn&rsquo;t kill her.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony sighed quietly as he leaned back into the couch cushions.</p><p>&ldquo;Still hurts.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter mirrored his position.</p><p>&ldquo;So this feeling will never go away, then?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony turned his gaze to the kid and saw his brown eyes looking back sadly. Tony shook his head slightly.</p><p>&ldquo;No, but you can try to move on.&rdquo; He spoke stronger, as if he really believed in what he was saying. For Peter&rsquo;s sake, at least. &ldquo;Try to continue saving people. Being a hero isn&rsquo;t the mistakes you didn&rsquo;t make; it&rsquo;s coming back from the ones you did.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter smiled then, but Tony could still see the brokenness behind it. He figured he would for a while. He would help him, though. He would save Peter, help him get back on his feet.</p><p>And he would never leave him. No, Peter was his kid.</p><p>Maybe that was selfish. Maybe Tony&rsquo;s self-destructive tendencies would rub off on the kid - maybe something worse would. Tony didn&rsquo;t care.</p><p>Peter was his kid, and Tony would never leave him.</p></p>",

An oblivious new young driver ran a stop sign, or someone checked their phone while behind the wheel, and the car swerved to the next lane over.</p>\n<p>The injuries were generally the same - minor cuts or bruises, or, on the more severe end of the spectrum, a concussion. On any other day, Peter would arrive at the scene, help people out of the cars, wait for the authorities to arrive, and swing off again.</p>\n<p>This was not any other day.</p>\n</p>",

Home.</p><p>A hand reached out to grab at something long gone. His finger fisting a pillowcase that was not his, to begin with, pressing it to his chest. It was usually tucked away into the depths of the crack between the mattress and the headboard. Buried away for no one to know and no one to see.</p><p>Which was his safe haven once, now left a bitter taste of betrayal in his mouth. Or was it the rising bile? He shoved the fabric of the pillowcase as far away from him as possible and leaned over the edge of the bed, throwing up some stomach acid since there was not anything else there. His stomach hadn&rsquo;t seen food in ages.</p><p><i>Great, another stained carpet.</i></p><p>With a groan, he got up from the bed. It was no use staying in that godforsaken bed. He wouldn&rsquo;t catch any sleep anytime soon anyway.</p><p>His limbs were aching as he made his way down to the kitchen, ignoring the mess he made on the floor. He would take care of it later. Tony slumped on one of the stools at the kitchen counter, burying his face in his hands.</p><p>So that&rsquo;s what his life had come to. Not sleeping, not eating, living on coffee and anxiety pills and working himself to death to get the people, he once considered family, excused. To get <i>him</i> excused. Steve Rogers. Captain America. Mister Righteous. Tony&rsquo;s <i>Husband</i>.</p><p><i>He is my friend.</i></p><p><i>So was I.</i></p><p><i>And so much more,</i> he wanted to say but did not, because the next thing he knew was Steve straddling him and bringing his shield down, over and over again, aiming for the head and arc reactor. A murderous look in his eyes.</p><p><i>I love you.</i></p><p><i>Did you know? Yes.</i></p><p><i>You look beautiful when you smile like that. Like you don&rsquo;t care what others might think about you.</i></p><p><i>Is everything a joke to you?</i></p><p><i>You know, you are nothing what the media says about you. You are one of the most caring and loving people I have met. You gave me a home. You are my home.</i></p><p><i>I know men worth ten of you.</i></p><p><i>Will you marry me?</i></p><p>What a fool he had been to believe him all the times he whispered I love you in his ear. All the times he cradled his face and looked at him like he was the most precious thing in the world. All the times he called him all kinds of adorable pet names in front of the others. Gorgeous, handsome, dear, <i>my love</i>.</p><p>A shattering, muffled scream rang through the empty room, followed by a silent sob. <i>Oh</i>, it was his own voice, which produced such noises. <i>Pathetic. That&rsquo;s why you weren&rsquo;t good enough for the Captain. That&rsquo;s why he chose him over you. That&rsquo;s why everyone always leaves you.</i></p><p><i>No, that&rsquo;s not true. Don&rsquo;t be a selfish asshole, Stark. Jarvis didn&rsquo;t leave you because he wanted to, but because he passed away. Pepper didn&rsquo;t leave you, she is just busy running your business. Rhodey didn&rsquo;t leave you, he is concentrating on rehab.</i></p><p>Tears were streaming down his cheeks, making his vision blurry but he knew where the whiskey was stashed away. He knew exactly where he would find the expensive alcohol. He hid it there, for emergencies. <i>Was feeling like dying an emergency? </i></p><p>With shaky hands, he opened one of the cupboards and shoved packages of pop tarts away. He once bought about twenty packages for Thor, because the God loved them. But Thor had been gone for a while now and so was Bruce so who would even care when he made a mess.</p><p>Behind the various boxes, he found what he was looking for. A bottle wrapped in a brown paper bag.</p><p>Tony wiped the tears away as he sunk down on the floor. His back against the kitchen counter, the alcohol pressed to his chest. A long time ago he promised Steve to work on his relationship with the deathly liquor, but Steve wasn&rsquo;t here anymore and all he had left was the pale imprint of a circle around his ring finger, where once a golden wedding band decorated his hand.</p>",

        "body": "<p><b>Fandom:</b>\u00a0Marvel</p><p><b>Pairings:</b>\u00a0Tony Stark/Bucky Barnes</p><p><b>Warnings:</b>\u00a0None</p><p>Tony went to take another drink of coffee only to find his mug empty. He glared at the brown but mostly dry bottom as if it had become empty on purpose. He went to the coffee maker only to find it, too, traitorously devoid of coffee. </p><p>\u201cJarvis?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, sir?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy is there no coffee?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a detective sir, but I would wager it\u2019s because you drank it all already.\u201d </p><p>Tony switched his glare from the empty carafe to the nearest camera. \u201cNo shit Sherlock. And why is there no more brewing, Mister I\u2019m-not-a-detective?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou have been through three pots in the past five hours. It would be detrimental to your health to continue.\u201d Truthfully Jarvis had wanted to cut him off earlier than this, but he knew that Tony was now shaky enough from the caffeine to not put up a true fight\u2026 he hoped. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you, my mother?\u201d he grumbled. </p><p>\u201cNo, simply your caretaker, sir.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell who the fuck made you that?\u201d he asked, both of them knowing full well he was the one responsible. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a mystery sir,\u201d Jarvis answered drily. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sending you to a nursing home,\u201d Tony said, sitting down again. </p><p>\u201cI quiver with fear.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s in charge of your code here, Jarvis?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s in charge of your security here, Doctor Stark?\u201d Jarvis replied without missing a beat. </p><p>\u201cIron Man?\u201d he tried. </p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but I\u2019m in charge of him as well,\u201d Jarvis said, ignoring for the moment that Iron Man and Tony were one in the same since Jarvis was integrated into the suit as well, and therefore was a large part of Iron Man\u2019s continued existence. </p><!-- more --><p>Tony sighed, rubbing his hands harshly against his face as a replacement for the caffeine he wasn\u2019t getting. \u201cI\u2019m too tired to deal with this mutiny,\u201d he declared. </p><p>\u201cThen you are also too tired for coffee. I\u2019m glad we are in agreement.\u201d With that, Jarvis saved the current projects and started shutting down the workshop. \u201cSweet dreams, sir.\u201d </p><p>Tony flipped off a camera but obediently went to the elevator. He leaned heavily against the wall as Jarvis brought him up to the penthouse. Three day inventing binges were a thing of the past, unfortunately. Tony missed those days in that no one gave a shit what he did, but everything else about that time could burn in hell. </p><p>He had Iron Man now, a team to backup and provide for, a company that needed attention, and a certain superhero to make heart eyes at without making an ass of himself. Not that he hadn\u2019t given it his best try, of course. However, it seemed Bucky was less than interested with a romp in the sack with Tony Stark. Tony tried to brush off the rejection&ndash; and publicly he did&ndash; because it had been a spur of the moment decision based solely on how fucking gorgeous Bucky was and little else. </p><p>But then he started spending time with Bucky and getting to know him&ndash; as Iron Man, of course&ndash; and then it fucking hurt because Tony developed a crush that evolved into something &mdash;-more&mdash;- worse, and Bucky\u2019d already turned him down as Tony, and so even if he had a chance as Iron Man, nothing could come of it. Sometimes Tony hated his life. </p><p>He was best friends with Captain fucking America and in love with the Winter Soldier, and neither of them could ever know who he was. Well, except for when he was dead, but that was the beauty of it: he wouldn\u2019t have to deal with the consequences then&ndash; wouldn\u2019t have to see the comfortable ease morph into something else. </p><p>It had been years since he thought the team hated Tony Stark, but that didn\u2019t mean they loved him or wanted him to be Iron Man. They wouldn\u2019t kick him off the team, but he wouldn\u2019t belong anymore, wouldn\u2019t be part of the family like he was now. Even if they liked Tony Stark, they wouldn\u2019t be able to forgive the lying. It was one thing to have a secret identity, it was quite another to do the mess he was doing. Tony wouldn\u2019t blame them of course, but that didn\u2019t mean that he wanted to experience it first-hand. </p><p>He collapsed onto bed after stripping to his boxers and groaned piteously into his pillow. </p><p>Problems for another day. </p><p>(And another, and another, and another.) </p><p>~~~</p><p>Steve very carefully didn\u2019t start yelling at him until after they were on the quinjet and the door sealed the Avengers away from the press. He pulled his cowl back angrily and whirled on him. \u201cWhat the fuck were you thinking!\u201d </p><p>Tony was in the Iron Man suit, very carefully situated in one of the chairs along the wall. \u201cI was thinking \u2018hey that body armor isn\u2019t enough to stop Bucky from getting a fucking hole in his side\u2019, or did you not see that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, I saw, but has it ever occured to you that you can save other people while not taking the hit yourself?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot all of us have vibranium, Winghead,\u201d he said tiredly. </p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve pushed me,\u201d Bucky said, mask in his hands as he looked at Tony&ndash; and Tony\u2019s bleeding side&ndash; in worry. </p><p>Tony snorted, head leaning back against the wall. \u201cThat would have looked great. I can see the headlines now \u2018Dissent in the Avengers,\u2019 \u2018Winter Soldier Still HYDRA?\u2019 \u2018Iron Man Turns Rogue.\u2019 Really paints a picture, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d All this ignoring the fact that Tony had been trying to push Bucky out of the way, just in the safest way possible and also he\u2019d been too slow. </p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what the hell they print if you\u2019re okay,\u201d Steve said, looking a lovely mixture of stern, stubborn, and disapproving that meant Tony wasn\u2019t going to shrug his way out of this. </p><p>That wasn\u2019t going to stop him from trying though. \u201cI disagree, so drop it, okay?\u201d </p><p>&hellip;That did the opposite of help. In Tony\u2019s defense, he was bleeding quite a bit, and still hadn\u2019t shaken off the sheer panic he\u2019d felt at seeing the blast heading towards Bucky. </p><p>Steve started ranting about not dying on the field or something, and Tony glanced at his teammates for help. Unfortunately, it looked like they all agreed with him. Tony sighed and settled in, knowing the lecture wouldn\u2019t end until they got to the Tower and he went to medical. </p><p>Steve, of course, wasn\u2019t done by the time they landed so he helped him to Dr. Cho, talking all the while. </p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d Tony said when the windows to the room blacked out. \u201cHe gives me that lecture every time I get hurt,\u201d he told Dr. Cho as he took his helmet off. </p><p>She raised an eyebrow at him. \u201cCan\u2019t imagine why. Get on the table.\u201d </p><p>Half an hour later, Tony was walking out of the room, his partially destroyed suit back on. </p><p>\u201cHow is he?\u201d Bucky asked her. </p><p>\u201cGood as new!\u201d Tony declared, arms spread as wide as he could get them without undoing Helen\u2019s work. </p><p>Everyone ignored him. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s off active duty for the next week to heal,\u201d she told them. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony yelped. She hadn\u2019t mentioned that to him. </p><p>Dr. Cho didn\u2019t even glance at him, too busy tapping at her tablet. He stuck his tongue out at her, not that anyone could see. It made him feel marginally better all the same. \u201cA week,\u201d she repeated. \u201cShort of the apocalypse, you are not fighting.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThank you Dr. Cho,\u201d Steve said, smiling at her. </p><p>She nodded and left, eyes glancing over the group just to make sure that none of them were hiding any serious injuries. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had less time off with worse injuries,\u201d he complained. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not helping your case man,\u201d Clint told him. </p><p>~~~</p><p>The team took care of him when they could, but when he was injured/off-duty, he tended to stick to being Tony not Iron Man&ndash; it was easier to resist temptation that way. Jarvis was taking care of him more than usual, but Tony missed the team so much that he couldn\u2019t focus on his work. And that was just unacceptable. </p><p>He put the suit on and went to the common area, hoping that Bucky would be around. Luck was on his side tonight, and Bucky was watching a movie, sitting alone on the couch. </p><p>\u201cHey sweet cream,\u201d Tony-as-Iron-Man said, joining him on the couch. </p><p>The corner of Bucky\u2019s mouth lifted. \u201cThat\u2019s a new one.\u201d </p><p>Tony shrugged, moving so his arms were resting along the back of the couch, his hand capable of patting Bucky\u2019s shoulder if he moved it about half an inch forward. \u201cIt sounded nicer than \u2018sweet cheeks\u2019, so I went with it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve complimented my ass before, y\u2019know,\u201d Bucky pointed out, picking up the remote to pause the movie so he could look at Iron Man. </p><p>\u201cHeat of battle, it doesn\u2019t count.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI was in the kitchen cooking breakfast.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFine, then the heat of the stove,\u201d Tony corrected, not feeling the slightest sliver of shame. He did have one fine ass, and he\u2019d probably kill to get his hands on it before he died. </p><p>Bucky shook his head, but was looking at him with something dangerously close to adoration in his eyes. \u201cYou could tell me you think I\u2019m pretty without blaming it on adrenaline, you know. I won\u2019t mind.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not pretty, you\u2019re more like\u2026 ruggedly handsome. Gorgeous or sexy, maybe.\u201d &ndash;what the fuck was he doing. He snapped his mouth shut. </p><p>Bucky, on the other hand, looked extremely pleased, a light flush across his cheeks. \u201cThat so.\u201d He leaned closer, half-crawled so he could put a hand on the face plate. He licked his lips. \u201cYou gonna do anything about that doll?\u201d </p><p>Tony cleared his throat. \u201cThere\u2019s kind of a helmet in the way and my s&ndash;\u201d </p><p>\u201cYour secret identity, I know.\u201d He leaned even closer, close enough that, were Tony\u2019s helmet off, they would be sharing breath. His eyes fluttered shut. \u201cI won\u2019t look.\u201d </p><p>Tony could leave, probably should leave, but he found himself saying, \u201cPromise?\u201d </p><p>Bucky\u2019s breath caught, equally surprised that he was agreeing to this. \u201cPromise.\u201d His hand slid from Iron Man\u2019s cheek to the side of his neck, and he scrunched his eyes harder to ensure he could keep his promise. When he heard the click and hiss of the helmet detaching, his lips parted of their own accord. </p><p>Tony leaned in and kissed him, mouths brushing together ever so lightly. Bucky\u2019s cheeks pinked, and he licked his lips as he unconsciously followed Tony\u2019s mouth when he pulled away. He\u2019d meant for it to be one kiss; a single kiss to get it out of both their heads and then they\u2019d do an embarrassed dodging each other thing for a week, and then they\u2019d be back to being friends. </p><p>But he found himself leaning back in, kissing Bucky deep and sensual that had him hardening inside the armor. He winced and pulled back with a jerk. </p><p>Under his eyelids, Bucky\u2019s eyes moved, automatically wanting to open his eyes and find out what was going on, but he scrunched his eyes tighter to stop himself. \u201cAre you okay? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Bucky\u2019s voice was rough with arousal, and even while trying to figure out a graceful exit so he could get out of sharp metal and into something more comfortable, Tony found himself paying too much attention to the cadence of Bucky\u2019s voice. </p><p>\u201cUh-\u201d shit. Tony scrambled for the helmet, clicking it back on. \u201cYou can open your eyes.\u201d Bucky did immediately, like he was a voice operated machine. \u201cThe- uh, armor\u2019s not very comfortable for this.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like an invitation,\u201d Bucky noted ruefully, mouth twisting with disappointment. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose I could convince you to change your mind about that doll?\u201d he asked, but he was already leaning away. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; Tony said regretfully. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh well. It was worth a shot.&rdquo; Bucky licked his lips, looking longingly at the seam of the faceplate where the line of the mouth was located. &ldquo;Any chance of doing it again sometime?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Tony stuttered out uncertainly. </p><p>&ldquo;You can think about it,&rdquo; Bucky rushed to assure him. &ldquo;God knows we both have time. Just- let me know when you have an answer?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I will.&rdquo; Bucky smiled brightly, and pressed a kiss to the faceplate where it would have been on Tony&rsquo;s cheek. Tony watched him leave the room, then sighed. He should have told Bucky sorry but no, his identity was secret and that wasn&rsquo;t open to negotiation, and there was no way for them to be together without compromising that. But he hadn&rsquo;t said that because he wanted to believe that if he thought about it long enough, and hard enough, that he would find a solution. </p><p>Like so many things in life though, the decision was taken from him. They were fighting someone called Molecule Man, and he made the suit disappear around him. He kinda wished he had dressed in something more&hellip; well something that covered more because thongs weren&rsquo;t exactly known for their coverage. </p><p>Clint loaned him his jacket, and Clint was bigger than him by enough that it covered most of his ass. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want that back, by the way.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Aw Clint, you know you wanna tap this,&rdquo; Tony said, striking a pose. </p><p>He rolled his eyes. &ldquo;No thanks man. Maybe if it wouldn&rsquo;t end with someone beating me up, I would.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony frowned as he straightened. &ldquo;Who would&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get back to the Tower fellas,&rdquo; Jan interrupted, landing on Hulk&rsquo;s shoulder and growing to her normal size. &ldquo;I think all of us are glad to know who Iron Man is, but we don&rsquo;t want to let the media know that.&rdquo; </p><p>Hulk put one massive hand around her legs to keep her steady and started walking to the quinjet. </p><p>&ldquo;Someone want to help me with this?&rdquo; Tony asked, eyeing his suit. It was unharmed, but had been completely disconnected from the arc reactor. It was frozen up, and Tony would need to jump it before it opened without breaking. </p><p>&ldquo;C'mon Buck,&rdquo; Steve said, walking to the feet of the suit, and Bucky went to the head. As one, they bent down and lifted, carrying it to the quinjet. </p><p>Tony put his hands in the pockets of the jacket and pretended like it didn&rsquo;t fucking hurt that Bucky hadn&rsquo;t glanced at him since his initial reveal. It didn&rsquo;t help that Bucky had his grumpy murder face on either. </p><p>They got back to the Tower, debriefed, and decided that they were going to do their best to ensure that Iron Man&rsquo;s identity didn&rsquo;t get out. Bucky&rsquo;d had enough time to put on an unaffected face, but he didn&rsquo;t look at Tony more than was strictly necessary. He left the meeting room before Tony could ask to talk to him for a minute, so he enlisted Jarvis&rsquo;s help and ambushed him in the gym later. Bucky was doing shirtless pull up&rsquo;s and Tony took a minute to appreciate that view because wow. Broad shoulders and thick muscles flexed and relaxed as he moved, and there was a slight sheen of sweat over his skin that made Tony&rsquo;s mouth water. </p><p>&ldquo;I get that you&rsquo;re mad at me,&rdquo; Tony said loudly, voice easily carrying across the space, &ldquo;but ignoring me seems a tad childish, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; </p><p>Bucky dropped to the floor, arms rolling down to rest at his sides. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not mad at you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Tony asked, strolling closer. It wasn&rsquo;t fair for Bucky to look so fucking hot when they were trying to have a serious conversation. &ldquo;I would be in your position.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not mad,&rdquo; he repeated, reaching for his water bottle. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m embarrassed.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Embarrassed? Okay you&rsquo;re going to have to explain that one to me cause I got nothing.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Iron Man,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;Tony. You didn&rsquo;t want me back when we were friends, and now that you&rsquo;re Tony Stark the chances of you liking me just dropped to zero.&rdquo; He scrubbed a hand over his face and took a pull from his bottle. &ldquo;I just need some time before I&rsquo;m back to normal, okay?&rdquo; </p><p>Tony knew that he should say yes of course no hard feelings, but he was still stuck on the part where Bucky thought that he wouldn&rsquo;t be interested in him. &ldquo;Have you seen you?&rdquo; He gave Bucky another more obvious look, practically leering. &ldquo;Are you forgetting that we&rsquo;re friends? And that I kissed you even when it was a stupid idea because I had a secret identity? Because I remember that, and I&rsquo;m a little insulted that you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Of course I remember it but&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;But nothing if you want to bone we should totally do that. I, for one, am completely in favor of us doing that. Right now. On the mat, probably.&rdquo; </p><p>That startled a laugh out of Bucky, and Tony preened. He scratched uncertainly at his scalp as he thought, even while his face was still smiling at what Tony&rsquo;d said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to mess up our friendship just because you&rsquo;re feeling a little horny.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;First of all, I&rsquo;m not feeling a little horny, I&rsquo;m feeling a lot horny. Second of all, the level of my libido isn&rsquo;t forcing me to make any decision I haven&rsquo;t wanted to make for months. Third of all, our friendship is solid, so shut it and kiss me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well, who am I to argue with that?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No one,&rdquo; Tony said, yelping as Bucky pulled him closer, tapping into that superstrength he had. &ldquo;No one at all.&rdquo; </p><p>Bucky nudged their noses together, lips a hairsbreadth apart though he didn&rsquo;t close the distance. &ldquo;You gonna kiss me or is your confidence all for show?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I thought we agreed that you should be the one kissing me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You ordered, I didn&rsquo;t say anything about agreeing.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh shut up,&rdquo; Tony whispered, putting his hands on either side of Bucky&rsquo;s face and surging up. It was simultaneously like their first kiss and nothing like it at all. Bucky&rsquo;s lips were just as plush, the scruff on his face just as delightfully scratchy, but the armor wasn&rsquo;t a barrier, and Tony was able to feel every inch of heat pouring off of Bucky from where they were pressed together. Why, exactly, had he felt a secret identity was worth missing this? Because he was wrong. Very very wrong. </p>",

I\u2019m glad we are in agreement.\u201d With that, Jarvis saved the current projects and started shutting down the workshop. \u201cSweet dreams, sir.\u201d </p><p>Tony flipped off a camera but obediently went to the elevator. He leaned heavily against the wall as Jarvis brought him up to the penthouse. Three day inventing binges were a thing of the past, unfortunately. Tony missed those days in that no one gave a shit what he did, but everything else about that time could burn in hell. </p><p>He had Iron Man now, a team to backup and provide for, a company that needed attention, and a certain superhero to make heart eyes at without making an ass of himself. Not that he hadn\u2019t given it his best try, of course. However, it seemed Bucky was less than interested with a romp in the sack with Tony Stark. Tony tried to brush off the rejection\u2013 and publicly he did\u2013 because it had been a spur of the moment decision based solely on how fucking gorgeous Bucky was and little else. </p><p>But then he started spending time with Bucky and getting to know him\u2013 as Iron Man, of course\u2013 and then it fucking hurt because Tony developed a crush that evolved into something \u2014-more\u2014- worse, and Bucky\u2019d already turned him down as Tony, and so even if he had a chance as Iron Man, nothing could come of it. Sometimes Tony hated his life. </p><p>He was best friends with Captain fucking America and in love with the Winter Soldier, and neither of them could ever know who he was. Well, except for when he was dead, but that was the beauty of it: he wouldn\u2019t have to deal with the consequences then\u2013 wouldn\u2019t have to see the comfortable ease morph into something else. </p><p>It had been years since he thought the team hated Tony Stark, but that didn\u2019t mean they loved him or wanted him to be Iron Man. They wouldn\u2019t kick him off the team, but he wouldn\u2019t belong anymore, wouldn\u2019t be part of the family like he was now. Even if they liked Tony Stark, they wouldn\u2019t be able to forgive the lying. It was one thing to have a secret identity, it was quite another to do the mess he was doing. Tony wouldn\u2019t blame them of course, but that didn\u2019t mean that he wanted to experience it first-hand. </p><p>He collapsed onto bed after stripping to his boxers and groaned piteously into his pillow. </p><p>Problems for another day. </p><p>(And another, and another, and another.) </p><p>~~~</p><p>Steve very carefully didn\u2019t start yelling at him until after they were on the quinjet and the door sealed the Avengers away from the press. He pulled his cowl back angrily and whirled on him. \u201cWhat the fuck were you thinking!\u201d </p><p>Tony was in the Iron Man suit, very carefully situated in one of the chairs along the wall. \u201cI was thinking \u2018hey that body armor isn\u2019t enough to stop Bucky from getting a fucking hole in his side\u2019, or did you not see that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, I saw, but has it ever occured to you that you can save other people while not taking the hit yourself?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot all of us have vibranium, Winghead,\u201d he said tiredly. </p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve pushed me,\u201d Bucky said, mask in his hands as he looked at Tony\u2013 and Tony\u2019s bleeding side\u2013 in worry. </p><p>Tony snorted, head leaning back against the wall. \u201cThat would have looked great. I can see the headlines now \u2018Dissent in the Avengers,\u2019 \u2018Winter Soldier Still HYDRA?\u2019 \u2018Iron Man Turns Rogue.\u2019 Really paints a picture, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d All this ignoring the fact that Tony had been trying to push Bucky out of the way, just in the safest way possible and also he\u2019d been too slow. </p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what the hell they print if you\u2019re okay,\u201d Steve said, looking a lovely mixture of stern, stubborn, and disapproving that meant Tony wasn\u2019t going to shrug his way out of this. </p><p>That wasn\u2019t going to stop him from trying though. \u201cI disagree, so drop it, okay?\u201d </p><p>\u2026That did the opposite of help. In Tony\u2019s defense, he was bleeding quite a bit, and still hadn\u2019t shaken off the sheer panic he\u2019d felt at seeing the blast heading towards Bucky. </p><p>Steve started ranting about not dying on the field or something, and Tony glanced at his teammates for help. Unfortunately, it looked like they all agreed with him. Tony sighed and settled in, knowing the lecture wouldn\u2019t end until they got to the Tower and he went to medical. </p><p>Steve, of course, wasn\u2019t done by the time they landed so he helped him to Dr. Cho, talking all the while. </p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d Tony said when the windows to the room blacked out. \u201cHe gives me that lecture every time I get hurt,\u201d he told Dr. Cho as he took his helmet off. </p><p>She raised an eyebrow at him. \u201cCan\u2019t imagine why. Get on the table.\u201d </p><p>Half an hour later, Tony was walking out of the room, his partially destroyed suit back on. </p><p>\u201cHow is he?\u201d Bucky asked her. </p><p>\u201cGood as new!\u201d Tony declared, arms spread as wide as he could get them without undoing Helen\u2019s work. </p><p>Everyone ignored him. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s off active duty for the next week to heal,\u201d she told them. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony yelped. She hadn\u2019t mentioned that to him. </p><p>Dr. Cho didn\u2019t even glance at him, too busy tapping at her tablet. He stuck his tongue out at her, not that anyone could see. It made him feel marginally better all the same. \u201cA week,\u201d she repeated. \u201cShort of the apocalypse, you are not fighting.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThank you Dr. Cho,\u201d Steve said, smiling at her. </p><p>She nodded and left, eyes glancing over the group just to make sure that none of them were hiding any serious injuries. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had less time off with worse injuries,\u201d he complained. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not helping your case man,\u201d Clint told him. </p><p>~~~</p><p>The team took care of him when they could, but when he was injured/off-duty, he tended to stick to being Tony not Iron Man\u2013 it was easier to resist temptation that way. Jarvis was taking care of him more than usual, but Tony missed the team so much that he couldn\u2019t focus on his work. And that was just unacceptable. </p><p>He put the suit on and went to the common area, hoping that Bucky would be around. Luck was on his side tonight, and Bucky was watching a movie, sitting alone on the couch. </p><p>\u201cHey sweet cream,\u201d Tony-as-Iron-Man said, joining him on the couch. </p><p>The corner of Bucky\u2019s mouth lifted. \u201cThat\u2019s a new one.\u201d </p><p>Tony shrugged, moving so his arms were resting along the back of the couch, his hand capable of patting Bucky\u2019s shoulder if he moved it about half an inch forward. \u201cIt sounded nicer than \u2018sweet cheeks\u2019, so I went with it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve complimented my ass before, y\u2019know,\u201d Bucky pointed out, picking up the remote to pause the movie so he could look at Iron Man. </p><p>\u201cHeat of battle, it doesn\u2019t count.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI was in the kitchen cooking breakfast.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFine, then the heat of the stove,\u201d Tony corrected, not feeling the slightest sliver of shame. He did have one fine ass, and he\u2019d probably kill to get his hands on it before he died. </p><p>Bucky shook his head, but was looking at him with something dangerously close to adoration in his eyes. \u201cYou could tell me you think I\u2019m pretty without blaming it on adrenaline, you know. I won\u2019t mind.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not pretty, you\u2019re more like\u2026 ruggedly handsome. Gorgeous or sexy, maybe.\u201d \u2013what the fuck was he doing. He snapped his mouth shut. </p><p>Bucky, on the other hand, looked extremely pleased, a light flush across his cheeks. \u201cThat so.\u201d He leaned closer, half-crawled so he could put a hand on the face plate. He licked his lips. \u201cYou gonna do anything about that doll?\u201d </p><p>Tony cleared his throat. \u201cThere\u2019s kind of a helmet in the way and my s\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cYour secret identity, I know.\u201d He leaned even closer, close enough that, were Tony\u2019s helmet off, they would be sharing breath. His eyes fluttered shut. \u201cI won\u2019t look.\u201d </p><p>Tony could leave, probably should leave, but he found himself saying, \u201cPromise?\u201d </p><p>Bucky\u2019s breath caught, equally surprised that he was agreeing to this. \u201cPromise.\u201d His hand slid from Iron Man\u2019s cheek to the side of his neck, and he scrunched his eyes harder to ensure he could keep his promise. When he heard the click and hiss of the helmet detaching, his lips parted of their own accord. </p><p>Tony leaned in and kissed him, mouths brushing together ever so lightly. Bucky\u2019s cheeks pinked, and he licked his lips as he unconsciously followed Tony\u2019s mouth when he pulled away. He\u2019d meant for it to be one kiss; a single kiss to get it out of both their heads and then they\u2019d do an embarrassed dodging each other thing for a week, and then they\u2019d be back to being friends. </p><p>But he found himself leaning back in, kissing Bucky deep and sensual that had him hardening inside the armor. He winced and pulled back with a jerk. </p><p>Under his eyelids, Bucky\u2019s eyes moved, automatically wanting to open his eyes and find out what was going on, but he scrunched his eyes tighter to stop himself. \u201cAre you okay? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Bucky\u2019s voice was rough with arousal, and even while trying to figure out a graceful exit so he could get out of sharp metal and into something more comfortable, Tony found himself paying too much attention to the cadence of Bucky\u2019s voice. </p><p>\u201cUh-\u201d shit. Tony scrambled for the helmet, clicking it back on. \u201cYou can open your eyes.\u201d Bucky did immediately, like he was a voice operated machine. \u201cThe- uh, armor\u2019s not very comfortable for this.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like an invitation,\u201d Bucky noted ruefully, mouth twisting with disappointment. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose I could convince you to change your mind about that doll?\u201d he asked, but he was already leaning away. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Tony said regretfully. </p><p>\u201cOh well. It was worth a shot.\u201d Bucky licked his lips, looking longingly at the seam of the faceplate where the line of the mouth was located. \u201cAny chance of doing it again sometime?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know,\u201d Tony stuttered out uncertainly. </p><p>\u201cYou can think about it,\u201d Bucky rushed to assure him. \u201cGod knows we both have time. Just- let me know when you have an answer?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, I will.\u201d Bucky smiled brightly, and pressed a kiss to the faceplate where it would have been on Tony\u2019s cheek. Tony watched him leave the room, then sighed. He should have told Bucky sorry but no, his identity was secret and that wasn\u2019t open to negotiation, and there was no way for them to be together without compromising that. But he hadn\u2019t said that because he wanted to believe that if he thought about it long enough, and hard enough, that he would find a solution. </p><p>Like so many things in life though, the decision was taken from him. They were fighting someone called Molecule Man, and he made the suit disappear around him. He kinda wished he had dressed in something more\u2026 well something that covered more because thongs weren\u2019t exactly known for their coverage. </p><p>Clint loaned him his jacket, and Clint was bigger than him by enough that it covered most of his ass. \u201cI don\u2019t want that back, by the way.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAw Clint, you know you wanna tap this,\u201d Tony said, striking a pose. </p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cNo thanks man. Maybe if it wouldn\u2019t end with someone beating me up, I would.\u201d </p><p>Tony frowned as he straightened. \u201cWho would\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get back to the Tower fellas,\u201d Jan interrupted, landing on Hulk\u2019s shoulder and growing to her normal size. \u201cI think all of us are glad to know who Iron Man is, but we don\u2019t want to let the media know that.\u201d </p><p>Hulk put one massive hand around her legs to keep her steady and started walking to the quinjet. </p><p>\u201cSomeone want to help me with this?\u201d Tony asked, eyeing his suit. It was unharmed, but had been completely disconnected from the arc reactor. It was frozen up, and Tony would need to jump it before it opened without breaking. </p><p>\u201cC'mon Buck,\u201d Steve said, walking to the feet of the suit, and Bucky went to the head. As one, they bent down and lifted, carrying it to the quinjet. </p><p>Tony put his hands in the pockets of the jacket and pretended like it didn\u2019t fucking hurt that Bucky hadn\u2019t glanced at him since his initial reveal. It didn\u2019t help that Bucky had his grumpy murder face on either. </p><p>They got back to the Tower, debriefed, and decided that they were going to do their best to ensure that Iron Man\u2019s identity didn\u2019t get out. Bucky\u2019d had enough time to put on an unaffected face, but he didn\u2019t look at Tony more than was strictly necessary. He left the meeting room before Tony could ask to talk to him for a minute, so he enlisted Jarvis\u2019s help and ambushed him in the gym later. Bucky was doing shirtless pull up\u2019s and Tony took a minute to appreciate that view because wow. Broad shoulders and thick muscles flexed and relaxed as he moved, and there was a slight sheen of sweat over his skin that made Tony\u2019s mouth water. </p><p>\u201cI get that you\u2019re mad at me,\u201d Tony said loudly, voice easily carrying across the space, \u201cbut ignoring me seems a tad childish, don\u2019t you think?\u201d </p><p>Bucky dropped to the floor, arms rolling down to rest at his sides. \u201cI\u2019m not mad at you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d Tony asked, strolling closer. It wasn\u2019t fair for Bucky to look so fucking hot when they were trying to have a serious conversation. \u201cI would be in your position.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not mad,\u201d he repeated, reaching for his water bottle. \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed.\u201d </p><p>\u201cEmbarrassed? Okay you\u2019re going to have to explain that one to me cause I got nothing.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIron Man,\u201d he sighed. \u201cTony. You didn\u2019t want me back when we were friends, and now that you\u2019re Tony Stark the chances of you liking me just dropped to zero.\u201d He scrubbed a hand over his face and took a pull from his bottle. \u201cI just need some time before I\u2019m back to normal, okay?\u201d </p><p>Tony knew that he should say yes of course no hard feelings, but he was still stuck on the part where Bucky thought that he wouldn\u2019t be interested in him. \u201cHave you seen you?\u201d He gave Bucky another more obvious look, practically leering. \u201cAre you forgetting that we\u2019re friends? And that I kissed you even when it was a stupid idea because I had a secret identity? Because I remember that, and I\u2019m a little insulted that you don\u2019t.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course I remember it but\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut nothing if you want to bone we should totally do that. I, for one, am completely in favor of us doing that. Right now. On the mat, probably.\u201d </p><p>That startled a laugh out of Bucky, and Tony preened. He scratched uncertainly at his scalp as he thought, even while his face was still smiling at what Tony\u2019d said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to mess up our friendship just because you\u2019re feeling a little horny.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFirst of all, I\u2019m not feeling a little horny, I\u2019m feeling a lot horny. Second of all, the level of my libido isn\u2019t forcing me to make any decision I haven\u2019t wanted to make for months. Third of all, our friendship is solid, so shut it and kiss me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, who am I to argue with that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d Tony said, yelping as Bucky pulled him closer, tapping into that superstrength he had. \u201cNo one at all.\u201d </p><p>Bucky nudged their noses together, lips a hairsbreadth apart though he didn\u2019t close the distance. \u201cYou gonna kiss me or is your confidence all for show?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI thought we agreed that you should be the one kissing me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou ordered, I didn\u2019t say anything about agreeing.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh shut up,\u201d Tony whispered, putting his hands on either side of Bucky\u2019s face and surging up. It was simultaneously like their first kiss and nothing like it at all. Bucky\u2019s lips were just as plush, the scruff on his face just as delightfully scratchy, but the armor wasn\u2019t a barrier, and Tony was able to feel every inch of heat pouring off of Bucky from where they were pressed together. Why, exactly, had he felt a secret identity was worth missing this? Because he was wrong. Very very wrong. </p>",

He glared at the brown but mostly dry bottom as if it had become empty on purpose. He went to the coffee maker only to find it, too, traitorously devoid of coffee. </p><p>\u201cJarvis?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, sir?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy is there no coffee?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a detective sir, but I would wager it\u2019s because you drank it all already.\u201d </p><p>Tony switched his glare from the empty carafe to the nearest camera. \u201cNo shit Sherlock. And why is there no more brewing, Mister I\u2019m-not-a-detective?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou have been through three pots in the past five hours. It would be detrimental to your health to continue.\u201d Truthfully Jarvis had wanted to cut him off earlier than this, but he knew that Tony was now shaky enough from the caffeine to not put up a true fight\u2026 he hoped. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you, my mother?\u201d he grumbled. </p><p>\u201cNo, simply your caretaker, sir.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell who the fuck made you that?\u201d he asked, both of them knowing full well he was the one responsible. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a mystery sir,\u201d Jarvis answered drily. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sending you to a nursing home,\u201d Tony said, sitting down again. </p><p>\u201cI quiver with fear.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s in charge of your code here, Jarvis?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s in charge of your security here, Doctor Stark?\u201d Jarvis replied without missing a beat. </p><p>\u201cIron Man?\u201d he tried. </p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but I\u2019m in charge of him as well,\u201d Jarvis said, ignoring for the moment that Iron Man and Tony were one in the same since Jarvis was integrated into the suit as well, and therefore was a large part of Iron Man\u2019s continued existence. </p>[[MORE]]<p>Tony sighed, rubbing his hands harshly against his face as a replacement for the caffeine he wasn\u2019t getting. \u201cI\u2019m too tired to deal with this mutiny,\u201d he declared. </p><p>\u201cThen you are also too tired for coffee. I\u2019m glad we are in agreement.\u201d With that, Jarvis saved the current projects and started shutting down the workshop. \u201cSweet dreams, sir.\u201d </p><p>Tony flipped off a camera but obediently went to the elevator. He leaned heavily against the wall as Jarvis brought him up to the penthouse. Three day inventing binges were a thing of the past, unfortunately. Tony missed those days in that no one gave a shit what he did, but everything else about that time could burn in hell. </p><p>He had Iron Man now, a team to backup and provide for, a company that needed attention, and a certain superhero to make heart eyes at without making an ass of himself. Not that he hadn\u2019t given it his best try, of course. However, it seemed Bucky was less than interested with a romp in the sack with Tony Stark. Tony tried to brush off the rejection\u2013 and publicly he did\u2013 because it had been a spur of the moment decision based solely on how fucking gorgeous Bucky was and little else. </p><p>But then he started spending time with Bucky and getting to know him\u2013 as Iron Man, of course\u2013 and then it fucking hurt because Tony developed a crush that evolved into something \u2014-more\u2014- worse, and Bucky\u2019d already turned him down as Tony, and so even if he had a chance as Iron Man, nothing could come of it. Sometimes Tony hated his life. </p><p>He was best friends with Captain fucking America and in love with the Winter Soldier, and neither of them could ever know who he was. Well, except for when he was dead, but that was the beauty of it: he wouldn\u2019t have to deal with the consequences then\u2013 wouldn\u2019t have to see the comfortable ease morph into something else. </p><p>It had been years since he thought the team hated Tony Stark, but that didn\u2019t mean they loved him or wanted him to be Iron Man. They wouldn\u2019t kick him off the team, but he wouldn\u2019t belong anymore, wouldn\u2019t be part of the family like he was now. Even if they liked Tony Stark, they wouldn\u2019t be able to forgive the lying. It was one thing to have a secret identity, it was quite another to do the mess he was doing. Tony wouldn\u2019t blame them of course, but that didn\u2019t mean that he wanted to experience it first-hand. </p><p>He collapsed onto bed after stripping to his boxers and groaned piteously into his pillow. </p><p>Problems for another day. </p><p>(And another, and another, and another.) </p><p>~~~</p><p>Steve very carefully didn\u2019t start yelling at him until after they were on the quinjet and the door sealed the Avengers away from the press. He pulled his cowl back angrily and whirled on him. \u201cWhat the fuck were you thinking!\u201d </p><p>Tony was in the Iron Man suit, very carefully situated in one of the chairs along the wall. \u201cI was thinking \u2018hey that body armor isn\u2019t enough to stop Bucky from getting a fucking hole in his side\u2019, or did you not see that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, I saw, but has it ever occured to you that you can save other people while not taking the hit yourself?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot all of us have vibranium, Winghead,\u201d he said tiredly. </p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve pushed me,\u201d Bucky said, mask in his hands as he looked at Tony\u2013 and Tony\u2019s bleeding side\u2013 in worry. </p><p>Tony snorted, head leaning back against the wall. \u201cThat would have looked great. I can see the headlines now \u2018Dissent in the Avengers,\u2019 \u2018Winter Soldier Still HYDRA?\u2019 \u2018Iron Man Turns Rogue.\u2019 Really paints a picture, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d All this ignoring the fact that Tony had been trying to push Bucky out of the way, just in the safest way possible and also he\u2019d been too slow. </p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what the hell they print if you\u2019re okay,\u201d Steve said, looking a lovely mixture of stern, stubborn, and disapproving that meant Tony wasn\u2019t going to shrug his way out of this. </p><p>That wasn\u2019t going to stop him from trying though. \u201cI disagree, so drop it, okay?\u201d </p><p>\u2026That did the opposite of help. In Tony\u2019s defense, he was bleeding quite a bit, and still hadn\u2019t shaken off the sheer panic he\u2019d felt at seeing the blast heading towards Bucky. </p><p>Steve started ranting about not dying on the field or something, and Tony glanced at his teammates for help. Unfortunately, it looked like they all agreed with him. Tony sighed and settled in, knowing the lecture wouldn\u2019t end until they got to the Tower and he went to medical. </p><p>Steve, of course, wasn\u2019t done by the time they landed so he helped him to Dr. Cho, talking all the while. </p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d Tony said when the windows to the room blacked out. \u201cHe gives me that lecture every time I get hurt,\u201d he told Dr. Cho as he took his helmet off. </p><p>She raised an eyebrow at him. \u201cCan\u2019t imagine why. Get on the table.\u201d </p><p>Half an hour later, Tony was walking out of the room, his partially destroyed suit back on. </p><p>\u201cHow is he?\u201d Bucky asked her. </p><p>\u201cGood as new!\u201d Tony declared, arms spread as wide as he could get them without undoing Helen\u2019s work. </p><p>Everyone ignored him. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s off active duty for the next week to heal,\u201d she told them. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony yelped. She hadn\u2019t mentioned that to him. </p><p>Dr. Cho didn\u2019t even glance at him, too busy tapping at her tablet. He stuck his tongue out at her, not that anyone could see. It made him feel marginally better all the same. \u201cA week,\u201d she repeated. \u201cShort of the apocalypse, you are not fighting.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThank you Dr. Cho,\u201d Steve said, smiling at her. </p><p>She nodded and left, eyes glancing over the group just to make sure that none of them were hiding any serious injuries. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had less time off with worse injuries,\u201d he complained. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not helping your case man,\u201d Clint told him. </p><p>~~~</p><p>The team took care of him when they could, but when he was injured/off-duty, he tended to stick to being Tony not Iron Man\u2013 it was easier to resist temptation that way. Jarvis was taking care of him more than usual, but Tony missed the team so much that he couldn\u2019t focus on his work. And that was just unacceptable. </p><p>He put the suit on and went to the common area, hoping that Bucky would be around. Luck was on his side tonight, and Bucky was watching a movie, sitting alone on the couch. </p><p>\u201cHey sweet cream,\u201d Tony-as-Iron-Man said, joining him on the couch. </p><p>The corner of Bucky\u2019s mouth lifted. \u201cThat\u2019s a new one.\u201d </p><p>Tony shrugged, moving so his arms were resting along the back of the couch, his hand capable of patting Bucky\u2019s shoulder if he moved it about half an inch forward. \u201cIt sounded nicer than \u2018sweet cheeks\u2019, so I went with it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve complimented my ass before, y\u2019know,\u201d Bucky pointed out, picking up the remote to pause the movie so he could look at Iron Man. </p><p>\u201cHeat of battle, it doesn\u2019t count.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI was in the kitchen cooking breakfast.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFine, then the heat of the stove,\u201d Tony corrected, not feeling the slightest sliver of shame. He did have one fine ass, and he\u2019d probably kill to get his hands on it before he died. </p><p>Bucky shook his head, but was looking at him with something dangerously close to adoration in his eyes. \u201cYou could tell me you think I\u2019m pretty without blaming it on adrenaline, you know. I won\u2019t mind.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not pretty, you\u2019re more like\u2026 ruggedly handsome. Gorgeous or sexy, maybe.\u201d \u2013what the fuck was he doing. He snapped his mouth shut. </p><p>Bucky, on the other hand, looked extremely pleased, a light flush across his cheeks. \u201cThat so.\u201d He leaned closer, half-crawled so he could put a hand on the face plate. He licked his lips. \u201cYou gonna do anything about that doll?\u201d </p><p>Tony cleared his throat. \u201cThere\u2019s kind of a helmet in the way and my s\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cYour secret identity, I know.\u201d He leaned even closer, close enough that, were Tony\u2019s helmet off, they would be sharing breath. His eyes fluttered shut. \u201cI won\u2019t look.\u201d </p><p>Tony could leave, probably should leave, but he found himself saying, \u201cPromise?\u201d </p><p>Bucky\u2019s breath caught, equally surprised that he was agreeing to this. \u201cPromise.\u201d His hand slid from Iron Man\u2019s cheek to the side of his neck, and he scrunched his eyes harder to ensure he could keep his promise. When he heard the click and hiss of the helmet detaching, his lips parted of their own accord. </p><p>Tony leaned in and kissed him, mouths brushing together ever so lightly. Bucky\u2019s cheeks pinked, and he licked his lips as he unconsciously followed Tony\u2019s mouth when he pulled away. He\u2019d meant for it to be one kiss; a single kiss to get it out of both their heads and then they\u2019d do an embarrassed dodging each other thing for a week, and then they\u2019d be back to being friends. </p><p>But he found himself leaning back in, kissing Bucky deep and sensual that had him hardening inside the armor. He winced and pulled back with a jerk. </p><p>Under his eyelids, Bucky\u2019s eyes moved, automatically wanting to open his eyes and find out what was going on, but he scrunched his eyes tighter to stop himself. \u201cAre you okay? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Bucky\u2019s voice was rough with arousal, and even while trying to figure out a graceful exit so he could get out of sharp metal and into something more comfortable, Tony found himself paying too much attention to the cadence of Bucky\u2019s voice. </p><p>\u201cUh-\u201d shit. Tony scrambled for the helmet, clicking it back on. \u201cYou can open your eyes.\u201d Bucky did immediately, like he was a voice operated machine. \u201cThe- uh, armor\u2019s not very comfortable for this.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like an invitation,\u201d Bucky noted ruefully, mouth twisting with disappointment. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose I could convince you to change your mind about that doll?\u201d he asked, but he was already leaning away. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Tony said regretfully. </p><p>\u201cOh well. It was worth a shot.\u201d Bucky licked his lips, looking longingly at the seam of the faceplate where the line of the mouth was located. \u201cAny chance of doing it again sometime?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know,\u201d Tony stuttered out uncertainly. </p><p>\u201cYou can think about it,\u201d Bucky rushed to assure him. \u201cGod knows we both have time. Just- let me know when you have an answer?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, I will.\u201d Bucky smiled brightly, and pressed a kiss to the faceplate where it would have been on Tony\u2019s cheek. Tony watched him leave the room, then sighed. He should have told Bucky sorry but no, his identity was secret and that wasn\u2019t open to negotiation, and there was no way for them to be together without compromising that. But he hadn\u2019t said that because he wanted to believe that if he thought about it long enough, and hard enough, that he would find a solution. </p><p>Like so many things in life though, the decision was taken from him. They were fighting someone called Molecule Man, and he made the suit disappear around him. He kinda wished he had dressed in something more\u2026 well something that covered more because thongs weren\u2019t exactly known for their coverage. </p><p>Clint loaned him his jacket, and Clint was bigger than him by enough that it covered most of his ass. \u201cI don\u2019t want that back, by the way.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAw Clint, you know you wanna tap this,\u201d Tony said, striking a pose. </p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cNo thanks man. Maybe if it wouldn\u2019t end with someone beating me up, I would.\u201d </p><p>Tony frowned as he straightened. \u201cWho would\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get back to the Tower fellas,\u201d Jan interrupted, landing on Hulk\u2019s shoulder and growing to her normal size. \u201cI think all of us are glad to know who Iron Man is, but we don\u2019t want to let the media know that.\u201d </p><p>Hulk put one massive hand around her legs to keep her steady and started walking to the quinjet. </p><p>\u201cSomeone want to help me with this?\u201d Tony asked, eyeing his suit. It was unharmed, but had been completely disconnected from the arc reactor. It was frozen up, and Tony would need to jump it before it opened without breaking. </p><p>\u201cC'mon Buck,\u201d Steve said, walking to the feet of the suit, and Bucky went to the head. As one, they bent down and lifted, carrying it to the quinjet. </p><p>Tony put his hands in the pockets of the jacket and pretended like it didn\u2019t fucking hurt that Bucky hadn\u2019t glanced at him since his initial reveal. It didn\u2019t help that Bucky had his grumpy murder face on either. </p><p>They got back to the Tower, debriefed, and decided that they were going to do their best to ensure that Iron Man\u2019s identity didn\u2019t get out. Bucky\u2019d had enough time to put on an unaffected face, but he didn\u2019t look at Tony more than was strictly necessary. He left the meeting room before Tony could ask to talk to him for a minute, so he enlisted Jarvis\u2019s help and ambushed him in the gym later. Bucky was doing shirtless pull up\u2019s and Tony took a minute to appreciate that view because wow. Broad shoulders and thick muscles flexed and relaxed as he moved, and there was a slight sheen of sweat over his skin that made Tony\u2019s mouth water. </p><p>\u201cI get that you\u2019re mad at me,\u201d Tony said loudly, voice easily carrying across the space, \u201cbut ignoring me seems a tad childish, don\u2019t you think?\u201d </p><p>Bucky dropped to the floor, arms rolling down to rest at his sides. \u201cI\u2019m not mad at you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d Tony asked, strolling closer. It wasn\u2019t fair for Bucky to look so fucking hot when they were trying to have a serious conversation. \u201cI would be in your position.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not mad,\u201d he repeated, reaching for his water bottle. \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed.\u201d </p><p>\u201cEmbarrassed? Okay you\u2019re going to have to explain that one to me cause I got nothing.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIron Man,\u201d he sighed. \u201cTony. You didn\u2019t want me back when we were friends, and now that you\u2019re Tony Stark the chances of you liking me just dropped to zero.\u201d He scrubbed a hand over his face and took a pull from his bottle. \u201cI just need some time before I\u2019m back to normal, okay?\u201d </p><p>Tony knew that he should say yes of course no hard feelings, but he was still stuck on the part where Bucky thought that he wouldn\u2019t be interested in him. \u201cHave you seen you?\u201d He gave Bucky another more obvious look, practically leering. \u201cAre you forgetting that we\u2019re friends? And that I kissed you even when it was a stupid idea because I had a secret identity? Because I remember that, and I\u2019m a little insulted that you don\u2019t.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course I remember it but\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut nothing if you want to bone we should totally do that. I, for one, am completely in favor of us doing that. Right now. On the mat, probably.\u201d </p><p>That startled a laugh out of Bucky, and Tony preened. He scratched uncertainly at his scalp as he thought, even while his face was still smiling at what Tony\u2019d said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to mess up our friendship just because you\u2019re feeling a little horny.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFirst of all, I\u2019m not feeling a little horny, I\u2019m feeling a lot horny. Second of all, the level of my libido isn\u2019t forcing me to make any decision I haven\u2019t wanted to make for months. Third of all, our friendship is solid, so shut it and kiss me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, who am I to argue with that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d Tony said, yelping as Bucky pulled him closer, tapping into that superstrength he had. \u201cNo one at all.\u201d </p><p>Bucky nudged their noses together, lips a hairsbreadth apart though he didn\u2019t close the distance. \u201cYou gonna kiss me or is your confidence all for show?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI thought we agreed that you should be the one kissing me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou ordered, I didn\u2019t say anything about agreeing.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh shut up,\u201d Tony whispered, putting his hands on either side of Bucky\u2019s face and surging up. It was simultaneously like their first kiss and nothing like it at all. Bucky\u2019s lips were just as plush, the scruff on his face just as delightfully scratchy, but the armor wasn\u2019t a barrier, and Tony was able to feel every inch of heat pouring off of Bucky from where they were pressed together. Why, exactly, had he felt a secret identity was worth missing this? Because he was wrong. Very very wrong. </p>",

And why is there no more brewing, Mister I&rsquo;m-not-a-detective?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You have been through three pots in the past five hours. It would be detrimental to your health to continue.&rdquo; Truthfully Jarvis had wanted to cut him off earlier than this, but he knew that Tony was now shaky enough from the caffeine to not put up a true fight&hellip; he hoped. </p><p>&ldquo;What are you, my mother?&rdquo; he grumbled. </p><p>&ldquo;No, simply your caretaker, sir.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well who the fuck made you that?&rdquo; he asked, both of them knowing full well he was the one responsible. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mystery sir,&rdquo; Jarvis answered drily. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sending you to a nursing home,&rdquo; Tony said, sitting down again. </p><p>&ldquo;I quiver with fear.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s in charge of your code here, Jarvis?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s in charge of your security here, Doctor Stark?&rdquo; Jarvis replied without missing a beat. </p><p>&ldquo;Iron Man?&rdquo; he tried. </p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps, but I&rsquo;m in charge of him as well,&rdquo; Jarvis said, ignoring for the moment that Iron Man and Tony were one in the same since Jarvis was integrated into the suit as well, and therefore was a large part of Iron Man&rsquo;s continued existence. </p><p>Tony sighed, rubbing his hands harshly against his face as a replacement for the caffeine he wasn&rsquo;t getting. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too tired to deal with this mutiny,&rdquo; he declared. </p><p>&ldquo;Then you are also too tired for coffee. I&rsquo;m glad we are in agreement.&rdquo; With that, Jarvis saved the current projects and started shutting down the workshop. &ldquo;Sweet dreams, sir.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony flipped off a camera but obediently went to the elevator. He leaned heavily against the wall as Jarvis brought him up to the penthouse. Three day inventing binges were a thing of the past, unfortunately. Tony missed those days in that no one gave a shit what he did, but everything else about that time could burn in hell. </p><p>He had Iron Man now, a team to backup and provide for, a company that needed attention, and a certain superhero to make heart eyes at without making an ass of himself. Not that he hadn&rsquo;t given it his best try, of course. However, it seemed Bucky was less than interested with a romp in the sack with Tony Stark. Tony tried to brush off the rejection&ndash; and publicly he did&ndash; because it had been a spur of the moment decision based solely on how fucking gorgeous Bucky was and little else. </p><p>But then he started spending time with Bucky and getting to know him&ndash; as Iron Man, of course&ndash; and then it fucking hurt because Tony developed a crush that evolved into something &mdash;-more&mdash;- worse, and Bucky&rsquo;d already turned him down as Tony, and so even if he had a chance as Iron Man, nothing could come of it. Sometimes Tony hated his life. </p><p>He was best friends with Captain fucking America and in love with the Winter Soldier, and neither of them could ever know who he was. Well, except for when he was dead, but that was the beauty of it: he wouldn&rsquo;t have to deal with the consequences then&ndash; wouldn&rsquo;t have to see the comfortable ease morph into something else. </p><p>It had been years since he thought the team hated Tony Stark, but that didn&rsquo;t mean they loved him or wanted him to be Iron Man. They wouldn&rsquo;t kick him off the team, but he wouldn&rsquo;t belong anymore, wouldn&rsquo;t be part of the family like he was now. Even if they liked Tony Stark, they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to forgive the lying. It was one thing to have a secret identity, it was quite another to do the mess he was doing. Tony wouldn&rsquo;t blame them of course, but that didn&rsquo;t mean that he wanted to experience it first-hand. </p><p>He collapsed onto bed after stripping to his boxers and groaned piteously into his pillow. </p><p>Problems for another day. </p><p>(And another, and another, and another.) </p><p>~~~</p><p>Steve very carefully didn&rsquo;t start yelling at him until after they were on the quinjet and the door sealed the Avengers away from the press. He pulled his cowl back angrily and whirled on him. &ldquo;What the fuck were you thinking!&rdquo; </p><p>Tony was in the Iron Man suit, very carefully situated in one of the chairs along the wall. &ldquo;I was thinking &lsquo;hey that body armor isn&rsquo;t enough to stop Bucky from getting a fucking hole in his side&rsquo;, or did you not see that?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I saw, but has it ever occured to you that you can save other people while not taking the hit yourself?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Not all of us have vibranium, Winghead,&rdquo; he said tiredly. </p><p>&ldquo;You could&rsquo;ve pushed me,&rdquo; Bucky said, mask in his hands as he looked at Tony&ndash; and Tony&rsquo;s bleeding side&ndash; in worry. </p><p>Tony snorted, head leaning back against the wall. &ldquo;That would have looked great. I can see the headlines now &lsquo;Dissent in the Avengers,&rsquo; &lsquo;Winter Soldier Still HYDRA?&rsquo; &lsquo;Iron Man Turns Rogue.&rsquo; Really paints a picture, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; All this ignoring the fact that Tony had been trying to push Bucky out of the way, just in the safest way possible and also he&rsquo;d been too slow. </p><p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter what the hell they print if you&rsquo;re okay,&rdquo; Steve said, looking a lovely mixture of stern, stubborn, and disapproving that meant Tony wasn&rsquo;t going to shrug his way out of this. </p><p>That wasn&rsquo;t going to stop him from trying though. &ldquo;I disagree, so drop it, okay?&rdquo; </p><p>&hellip;That did the opposite of help. In Tony&rsquo;s defense, he was bleeding quite a bit, and still hadn&rsquo;t shaken off the sheer panic he&rsquo;d felt at seeing the blast heading towards Bucky. </p><p>Steve started ranting about not dying on the field or something, and Tony glanced at his teammates for help. Unfortunately, it looked like they all agreed with him. Tony sighed and settled in, knowing the lecture wouldn&rsquo;t end until they got to the Tower and he went to medical. </p><p>Steve, of course, wasn&rsquo;t done by the time they landed so he helped him to Dr. Cho, talking all the while. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank God,&rdquo; Tony said when the windows to the room blacked out. &ldquo;He gives me that lecture every time I get hurt,&rdquo; he told Dr. Cho as he took his helmet off. </p><p>She raised an eyebrow at him. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t imagine why. Get on the table.&rdquo; </p><p>Half an hour later, Tony was walking out of the room, his partially destroyed suit back on. </p><p>&ldquo;How is he?&rdquo; Bucky asked her. </p><p>&ldquo;Good as new!&rdquo; Tony declared, arms spread as wide as he could get them without undoing Helen&rsquo;s work. </p><p>Everyone ignored him. </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s off active duty for the next week to heal,&rdquo; she told them. </p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Tony yelped. She hadn&rsquo;t mentioned that to him. </p><p>Dr. Cho didn&rsquo;t even glance at him, too busy tapping at her tablet. He stuck his tongue out at her, not that anyone could see. It made him feel marginally better all the same. &ldquo;A week,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Short of the apocalypse, you are not fighting.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you Dr. Cho,&rdquo; Steve said, smiling at her. </p><p>She nodded and left, eyes glancing over the group just to make sure that none of them were hiding any serious injuries. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had less time off with worse injuries,&rdquo; he complained. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not helping your case man,&rdquo; Clint told him. </p><p>~~~</p><p>The team took care of him when they could, but when he was injured/off-duty, he tended to stick to being Tony not Iron Man&ndash; it was easier to resist temptation that way. Jarvis was taking care of him more than usual, but Tony missed the team so much that he couldn&rsquo;t focus on his work. And that was just unacceptable. </p><p>He put the suit on and went to the common area, hoping that Bucky would be around. Luck was on his side tonight, and Bucky was watching a movie, sitting alone on the couch. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey sweet cream,&rdquo; Tony-as-Iron-Man said, joining him on the couch. </p><p>The corner of Bucky&rsquo;s mouth lifted. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a new one.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony shrugged, moving so his arms were resting along the back of the couch, his hand capable of patting Bucky&rsquo;s shoulder if he moved it about half an inch forward. &ldquo;It sounded nicer than &lsquo;sweet cheeks&rsquo;, so I went with it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve complimented my ass before, y&rsquo;know,&rdquo; Bucky pointed out, picking up the remote to pause the movie so he could look at Iron Man. </p><p>&ldquo;Heat of battle, it doesn&rsquo;t count.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I was in the kitchen cooking breakfast.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Fine, then the heat of the stove,&rdquo; Tony corrected, not feeling the slightest sliver of shame. He did have one fine ass, and he&rsquo;d probably kill to get his hands on it before he died. </p><p>Bucky shook his head, but was looking at him with something dangerously close to adoration in his eyes. &ldquo;You could tell me you think I&rsquo;m pretty without blaming it on adrenaline, you know. I won&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not pretty, you&rsquo;re more like&hellip; ruggedly handsome. Gorgeous or sexy, maybe.&rdquo; &ndash;what the fuck was he doing. He snapped his mouth shut. </p><p>Bucky, on the other hand, looked extremely pleased, a light flush across his cheeks. &ldquo;That so.&rdquo; He leaned closer, half-crawled so he could put a hand on the face plate. He licked his lips. &ldquo;You gonna do anything about that doll?&rdquo; </p><p>Tony cleared his throat. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s kind of a helmet in the way and my s&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Your secret identity, I know.&rdquo; He leaned even closer, close enough that, were Tony&rsquo;s helmet off, they would be sharing breath. His eyes fluttered shut. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t look.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony could leave, probably should leave, but he found himself saying, &ldquo;Promise?&rdquo; </p><p>Bucky&rsquo;s breath caught, equally surprised that he was agreeing to this. &ldquo;Promise.&rdquo; His hand slid from Iron Man&rsquo;s cheek to the side of his neck, and he scrunched his eyes harder to ensure he could keep his promise. When he heard the click and hiss of the helmet detaching, his lips parted of their own accord. </p><p>Tony leaned in and kissed him, mouths brushing together ever so lightly. Bucky&rsquo;s cheeks pinked, and he licked his lips as he unconsciously followed Tony&rsquo;s mouth when he pulled away. He&rsquo;d meant for it to be one kiss; a single kiss to get it out of both their heads and then they&rsquo;d do an embarrassed dodging each other thing for a week, and then they&rsquo;d be back to being friends. </p><p>But he found himself leaning back in, kissing Bucky deep and sensual that had him hardening inside the armor. He winced and pulled back with a jerk. </p><p>Under his eyelids, Bucky&rsquo;s eyes moved, automatically wanting to open his eyes and find out what was going on, but he scrunched his eyes tighter to stop himself. &ldquo;Are you okay? What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Bucky&rsquo;s voice was rough with arousal, and even while trying to figure out a graceful exit so he could get out of sharp metal and into something more comfortable, Tony found himself paying too much attention to the cadence of Bucky&rsquo;s voice. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh-&rdquo; shit. Tony scrambled for the helmet, clicking it back on. &ldquo;You can open your eyes.&rdquo; Bucky did immediately, like he was a voice operated machine. &ldquo;The- uh, armor&rsquo;s not very comfortable for this.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t sound like an invitation,&rdquo; Bucky noted ruefully, mouth twisting with disappointment. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose I could convince you to change your mind about that doll?&rdquo; he asked, but he was already leaning away. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; Tony said regretfully. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh well. It was worth a shot.&rdquo; Bucky licked his lips, looking longingly at the seam of the faceplate where the line of the mouth was located. &ldquo;Any chance of doing it again sometime?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Tony stuttered out uncertainly. </p><p>&ldquo;You can think about it,&rdquo; Bucky rushed to assure him. &ldquo;God knows we both have time. Just- let me know when you have an answer?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I will.&rdquo; Bucky smiled brightly, and pressed a kiss to the faceplate where it would have been on Tony&rsquo;s cheek. Tony watched him leave the room, then sighed. He should have told Bucky sorry but no, his identity was secret and that wasn&rsquo;t open to negotiation, and there was no way for them to be together without compromising that. But he hadn&rsquo;t said that because he wanted to believe that if he thought about it long enough, and hard enough, that he would find a solution. </p><p>Like so many things in life though, the decision was taken from him. They were fighting someone called Molecule Man, and he made the suit disappear around him. He kinda wished he had dressed in something more&hellip; well something that covered more because thongs weren&rsquo;t exactly known for their coverage. </p><p>Clint loaned him his jacket, and Clint was bigger than him by enough that it covered most of his ass. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want that back, by the way.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Aw Clint, you know you wanna tap this,&rdquo; Tony said, striking a pose. </p><p>He rolled his eyes. &ldquo;No thanks man. Maybe if it wouldn&rsquo;t end with someone beating me up, I would.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony frowned as he straightened. &ldquo;Who would&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get back to the Tower fellas,&rdquo; Jan interrupted, landing on Hulk&rsquo;s shoulder and growing to her normal size. &ldquo;I think all of us are glad to know who Iron Man is, but we don&rsquo;t want to let the media know that.&rdquo; </p><p>Hulk put one massive hand around her legs to keep her steady and started walking to the quinjet. </p><p>&ldquo;Someone want to help me with this?&rdquo; Tony asked, eyeing his suit. It was unharmed, but had been completely disconnected from the arc reactor. It was frozen up, and Tony would need to jump it before it opened without breaking. </p><p>&ldquo;C'mon Buck,&rdquo; Steve said, walking to the feet of the suit, and Bucky went to the head. As one, they bent down and lifted, carrying it to the quinjet. </p><p>Tony put his hands in the pockets of the jacket and pretended like it didn&rsquo;t fucking hurt that Bucky hadn&rsquo;t glanced at him since his initial reveal. It didn&rsquo;t help that Bucky had his grumpy murder face on either. </p><p>They got back to the Tower, debriefed, and decided that they were going to do their best to ensure that Iron Man&rsquo;s identity didn&rsquo;t get out. Bucky&rsquo;d had enough time to put on an unaffected face, but he didn&rsquo;t look at Tony more than was strictly necessary. He left the meeting room before Tony could ask to talk to him for a minute, so he enlisted Jarvis&rsquo;s help and ambushed him in the gym later. Bucky was doing shirtless pull up&rsquo;s and Tony took a minute to appreciate that view because wow. Broad shoulders and thick muscles flexed and relaxed as he moved, and there was a slight sheen of sweat over his skin that made Tony&rsquo;s mouth water. </p><p>&ldquo;I get that you&rsquo;re mad at me,&rdquo; Tony said loudly, voice easily carrying across the space, &ldquo;but ignoring me seems a tad childish, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; </p><p>Bucky dropped to the floor, arms rolling down to rest at his sides. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not mad at you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Tony asked, strolling closer. It wasn&rsquo;t fair for Bucky to look so fucking hot when they were trying to have a serious conversation. &ldquo;I would be in your position.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not mad,&rdquo; he repeated, reaching for his water bottle. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m embarrassed.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Embarrassed? Okay you&rsquo;re going to have to explain that one to me cause I got nothing.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Iron Man,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;Tony. You didn&rsquo;t want me back when we were friends, and now that you&rsquo;re Tony Stark the chances of you liking me just dropped to zero.&rdquo; He scrubbed a hand over his face and took a pull from his bottle. &ldquo;I just need some time before I&rsquo;m back to normal, okay?&rdquo; </p><p>Tony knew that he should say yes of course no hard feelings, but he was still stuck on the part where Bucky thought that he wouldn&rsquo;t be interested in him. &ldquo;Have you seen you?&rdquo; He gave Bucky another more obvious look, practically leering. &ldquo;Are you forgetting that we&rsquo;re friends? And that I kissed you even when it was a stupid idea because I had a secret identity? Because I remember that, and I&rsquo;m a little insulted that you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Of course I remember it but&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;But nothing if you want to bone we should totally do that. I, for one, am completely in favor of us doing that. Right now. On the mat, probably.&rdquo; </p><p>That startled a laugh out of Bucky, and Tony preened. He scratched uncertainly at his scalp as he thought, even while his face was still smiling at what Tony&rsquo;d said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to mess up our friendship just because you&rsquo;re feeling a little horny.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;First of all, I&rsquo;m not feeling a little horny, I&rsquo;m feeling a lot horny. Second of all, the level of my libido isn&rsquo;t forcing me to make any decision I haven&rsquo;t wanted to make for months. Third of all, our friendship is solid, so shut it and kiss me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well, who am I to argue with that?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No one,&rdquo; Tony said, yelping as Bucky pulled him closer, tapping into that superstrength he had. &ldquo;No one at all.&rdquo; </p><p>Bucky nudged their noses together, lips a hairsbreadth apart though he didn&rsquo;t close the distance. &ldquo;You gonna kiss me or is your confidence all for show?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I thought we agreed that you should be the one kissing me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You ordered, I didn&rsquo;t say anything about agreeing.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh shut up,&rdquo; Tony whispered, putting his hands on either side of Bucky&rsquo;s face and surging up.

Rhodey gifts him a beautiful crib and sets it up in his bedroom, refusing to let Peter sleep all alone in the living room.</p><p>- It takes him some time to figure out how to be responsible for another human being but he wouldn&rsquo;t give Peter up for anything in the world.</p><p>- A parenting book suggests that skin on skin contact works wonders with fuzzy premature babies, so Peter often ends up napping on Tony&rsquo;s bare chest.</p><p>- The old lady across the floor offers to babysit Peter while Tony takes extra shifts at an auto shop. Tony repairs her car and radio every now and then in exchange.</p><p>- Peter is often sick and pretty small for a baby. Pepper sneaks Medicine into Tony&rsquo;s cupboards because he&rsquo;s too stubborn to ask for help.</p><p>- Tony ends up being a clingy dad and picks Peter up whenever he starts to whine. He sings to the baby in Italian because it&rsquo;s the only thing that calms Peter down when he&rsquo;s being extra grumpy.</p><p>- On his days off Tony and Peter spend the whole afternoons on the living room floor, Peter laying on his play mat giggling and sucking on his sock-clad feet while his dad tinkers with old electro devices, talking to Peter and answering to his bubbling and grunts, stroking his tummy occasionally.</p><p>- Tony can&rsquo;t remember the last time he bought something for himself. He puts money aside to afford a two-bedroom apartment at some point and spends the rest on diapers, food and necessities for his son.</p><p>- He&rsquo;s the kinda dad who takes thousands of pictures of Peter and puts them all in an album and captions them to embarrass his son later on. He has to think of the future.</p><p>- He sends Howard a letter with a picture of Baby Peter after almost a year of not talking to his father. Howard sends a response with a &ldquo;He&rsquo;s cute. You did good son.&rdquo; from the prison.</p><p>- Tony has a lot of bad days, when he loses hope and faith, when the money is tight and he ends up late in the auto shop to take the extra hours but then Peter smiles his big toothless smile and he remembers why he keeps going and doing it.</p>",
