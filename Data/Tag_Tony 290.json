        "body": "<p>I\u2019m baaaaack.</p><p>First, I have to start with a profound apology. I had not intended to take so long in updating, but the last month turned out to be&hellip;one of the most trying I&rsquo;ve had, really. Long story short, the deterioration and deaths of two beloved pets, literally hours apart, and a visit to the ER for something that I am in the process of an expected months-long recovery from, made what I thought would be a two-week delay due to a Big Bang I was a part of into much more.</p><p>On the bright side, this chapter turned into an incredibly long one, so I have decided to split it into two parts. That means you can be assured of another update next week. These two are doozies, too, so I think you all might really enjoy them. I also ended up changing the name of both parts, as much of what I thought I would be writing about is going to come up in the chapter after this two-parter.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfis9Z9B5UsLCTwEdOVR1lA\">@merelypassingtime</a> for betaing and endless encouragement.<br/></p><p>Please enjoy!</p><p>\n<a href=\"https://grandraconteur.tumblr.com/post/176469742683/wish-you-were-here-chapter-1\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://grandraconteur.tumblr.com/post/176705890708/wish-you-were-here-chapter-2\">2</a> <br/></p><p>Also on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15498879/chapters/37235921\">AO3</a></p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15498879/chapters/35979762\">1</a>,<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15498879/chapters/36201009#workskin\"> 2</a><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><i>Hello. \u00a0</i></p><p><i>Is there anybody in there?</i></p><p><i>Just nod if you can hear me.</i></p><p><i>Is there anyone home?</i></p><p>~&ldquo;Comfortably Numb&rdquo;, from <i>The Wall</i>, November 30, 1979</p><p><br/></p><p>92% match.</p><p>92%.</p><p>Face shape, hairline, lips, eyes, even the wrinkles in his forehead matched up. The playback footage was not quite able to pull up his eye color to match it to the one in Peter\u2019s family photo, but&hellip;</p><p>\u201cThat-that\u2019s insanely high for a coincidence, right Mr. Stark?\u201d</p><p>The engineer said nothing for some time as he continued to look over Friday\u2019s analysis with a fine tooth comb. After some time, though, he nodded, almost reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, kid. That\u2019s pretty damn high.\u201d</p><p>Already tensed and on edge, that confirmation from his mentor left Peter\u2019s legs feeling like jelly.</p><p>Almost without looking, Tony put a hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder and guided him to take a seat at the desk.</p><p>\u201cSit down, kid. Don\u2019t need you falling over and cracking your head open. Your aunt would kick my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow close to fingerprint identification accuracy is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething between the 60s and 70s would within the margin of error, but something in the 90s with a decade between the images is pretty difficult to explain away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo&hellip;so it\u2019s him, then?\u201d Peter questioned in a small voice.</p><p>Mr. Stark\u2019s mouth was set in a tight line, and when he spoke, his voice was gruff. \u201cI can\u2019t make any promises at this point, but&hellip;yeah, it is probably his face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, it\u2019s probably his face? Is it someone else\u2019s body or something? Are there face stealing aliens out there like in that one movie? Are you keeping it from the public to prevent mass hysteria?\u201d Peter demanded, his voice rising with each question.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa. Settle down, kid.\u201d Tony said. In his own exhaustion he had misjudged Peter\u2019s mental state badly, now he backtracked. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any face stealing aliens that I know of. I was just saying we don\u2019t know enough right now. I mean a face match isn\u2019t foolproof. \u201cLook,\u201d Mr. Stark continued, taking a seat himself and kicking his feet up on the desk. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated by this freaky world you and I live in. Nothing is simple for us anymore. Sure, that guy looks a hell of a lot like your dad, he probably has the same face, but that doesn\u2019t mean he <i>is\u00a0</i>your dad. As sick and twisted as it is, maybe some dipshit maybe trying to get to you by posing as your dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d Peter interrupted, \u201chow would they know to pretend to be my father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the downside to being a hero, it means you end up with enemies like that Toomes guys. People who know who you are and aren\u2019t afraid to use your family to hurt or control you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it is someone like that, someone pretending to be my dad or something, how will we know?\u201d</p><p>The engineer crossed his arms and rested his chin on his chest. \u201cGive me a few days. I\u2019ll have Friday do some digging, see if she can track down any more appearances by your dad. See how far back his appearances go. If I can find some from before your little encounter with the radioactive spider-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-then it can\u2019t be a ploy to get to me.\u201d Peter finished for him breathlessly.</p><p>Mr. Stark smiled softly, tapping his nose with the finger of one hand and point at him with the other. \u201cYou\u2019ve got it.\u201d Looking Peter in the eye, he continued. \u201cI promise, we\u2019re going to get to the bottom of this together, but for now why don\u2019t we let Friday do her thing? You can take a load off, go home, build some lego structures with Ned, do whatever it is teenagers are doing these days for fun. Just let me and Friday carry this weight for a bit, alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, wait, but I want to help, Mr. Stark! I can\u2019t just wait-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Mr. Stark\u2019s tone was blunt, but not unkind. \u201cHell, what can either of us do that Friday can\u2019t at this point? In an hour Fri can process more information than you or I could in a month.\u201d</p><p>Peter hesitated, but sullenly nodded his acceptance.</p><p>\u201cAnd no lone-wolfing it behind my back, either,\u201d Tony added, with a knowing look.</p><p>Peter made a sound of complaint, but one look from Mr. Stark and he backed off. They both knew Tony was right.</p><p>\u201cI just&hellip;shouldn\u2019t I be involved in finding him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will be,\u201d Mr. Stark responded, standing from his seat and stretching. Several parts of him popped and creaked as he did. He shot Peter a look, daring him to comment. \u201cBut right now, we have to leave it up to Friday. And you need some rest. You look awful.\u201d</p><p>The ghost of a smile graced Peter\u2019s lips. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll do my best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I ask.\u201d Mr. Stark said, handing him back the photograph.</p><p>Almost reverently, Peter takes it back, pausing for a moment to look at the image. There\u2019s a haughtiness in the smirk his father gives the camera, in stark contrast to his mother\u2019s soft smile and Peter\u2019s own boyish grin. Despite knowing better, he\u2019s always found his father looked stiff and unapproachable, and so distant from the woman at his side and the child they share. It\u2019s an illusion compounded by the lack of resemblance to his father, who is all angles and harsh lines; Peter has always taken more after his mother\u2019s side, with rounded faces and full cheeks, and the same floppy brown hair. Hardly anyone that looks at it thinks they look like a family, but Peter\u2019s always thought they did, anyway. They <i>were</i>, it just wasn\u2019t always easy to see from the outside.</p><p>Tucking away the photograph, Peter offered Mr. Stark a quick salute before heading towards the elevator. As Peter stepped in, Mr. Stark spoke up.</p><p>\u201cHey, one last question, kid. What\u2019s your dad\u2019s name? I want to see if I can cross reference it with pictures if Friday finds any.\u201d</p><p>Shifting his backpack a bit higher on his shoulder in a nervous gesture, Peter replied, \u201cHis name was&hellip;is, I guess, Stephen Strange. Doctor Stephen Strange, if that helps. He\u2019s a neurosurgeon.\u201d</p><p>The last thing Peter saw as the elevator doors closed was a curious quirk of Mr. Stark\u2019s eyebrow.</p><!-- more --><p>***</p><p>Sitting around and doing nothing for three days did not sit well with Peter, who was much more inclined to take charge than let events unfold around him. However, in this case, Mr. Stark was probably right. It <i>had\u00a0</i>been kind of&hellip;a dramatic couple of days, to put it lightly. \u2018To put it lightly\u2019 even felt like an insufficient qualifier. And really, like Mr. Stark had said, what could he do that Friday couldn\u2019t? He knew he was much better off spending his time on homework than sitting around a lab, twiddling his thumbs while the super A.I worked her magic under Mr. Stark\u2019s guiding hand.</p><p>That didn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t royally suck, though.</p><p>At first, Peter attempted to procrastinate on his homework. Cleaning the kitchen, vacuuming and mopping the floors, checking in on the building owner to see if she wanted any assistance. She didn\u2019t, but she did offer him cookies and tea, and he spent a surprisingly pleasant hour listening to her gossip about two of her tenants. Afterward, he returned to the apartment and spent another couple of hours wasting time online. Looking at Tumblr (more Avengers gossip, rumors about a Buffy the Vampire Slayer reboot, a post about Tony Stark\u2019s role in the Avengers Civil War that Peter had to take a few minutes to explain all the reasons why the poster was wrong). Checking his email (Amazon deals, New to Redbox, Science Mag Daily, an offer for an internship with New York Hall of Science, an offer for an internship with Timely Pharmaceuticals, most of which he ignored aside from the NYHoS which could prove interesting). Falling into a loop of YouTube videos (Maru in a Box, Grumpy Cat, Best Cat Vines, Best Dog Vines, a dog dancing with his owner to an Irish jig). Eventually, though, he was forced to accept the inevitable and pull up his homework list.</p><p>Peter spent the rest of Saturday studying for his Spanish exam. Or, rather, \u00a0attempting to study for his Spanish exam. As hard as he tried, it was impossible to focus completely on anything. Compartmentalizing was the key, as Mr. Stark had told him once during one of their engineering tutoring sessions. Sometimes, when you had a ton of big things coming at you, you had to compartmentalize in order to deal with them without losing your mind. Take on one big thing at a time, and put the rest on the back burner until you could handle them. He didn\u2019t think Mr. Stark was talking about big things like finding out your supposedly dead father was actually alive- possibly -and had faked his death so he could abandon you when his mentor taught him that technique, though.</p><p>That was the thing, wasn\u2019t it? If his dad wasn\u2019t dead, then why wasn\u2019t he here? If it wasn\u2019t death, then it was abandonment, and Peter couldn\u2019t-</p><p>Letting out a breath sharply through his nose, Peter shook himself a bit, cutting off that train of thought.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, enough of that&hellip;enough, just&hellip;let\u2019s focus on this\u2026 \u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1 la biblioteca?\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>The funny thing about a breakdown, Peter realized, was that general consensus said they hit you all of a sudden, like being in a car crash. But Peter had some familiarity with breakdowns, and in his experience, he\u2019d found that they more resembled <i>witnessing\u00a0</i>a car crash from the outside. You could see it coming, vaguely, but time seemed to slow just enough to make you think that maybe it would be all right, up until the moment of impact. Peter\u2019s breakdown after Ben\u2019s murder was like that. Slow to build, taking over a week to hit. When it did, he didn\u2019t even notice he <i>was </i>breaking down, not until May came into his room and sat on his bed, where he\u2019d been curled up for some time. He wasn\u2019t even sure how long it had been, not until she told him it was nearly dinner and he hadn\u2019t climbed out except to use the bathroom. He\u2019d just felt&hellip;cold, empty.</p><p>Although that one had been much more recent, the total numbness he\u2019d experienced made it almost immeasurable. More tangible by far was Peter\u2019s breakdown after the car crash, which came after a few days of numbness, stuck in a hospital room as he watched his father struggle to accept his catastrophic injuries. It was more brief images than anything really concrete, as to be expected for something that occurred when he was only six, but what he recalled was picture perfect; the crack as he twisted his Captain America action figure so hard as something hot burbled up into his chest that the arm came off. The faded blue of the coarse hospital blanket as he stared down at the broken toy in his lap. The sterile scent of cleanser that made his nose burn. Intense cold in his limbs, even his right leg in its cast, despite the intense <i>heat </i>in his chest and eyes. Then warmth, as long arms carefully encased him, avoiding catching him on the wires and brackets that held the hands together. His father\u2019s warm, gravelly voice as he murmured something indecipherable in his ear but comforting all the same. The only discernible words, or at least the only he could recall, were a softly spoken \u201cI\u2019m here, pal.\u201d</p><p>His father had been distant in the days after the crash, almost catatonic. He\u2019d tried, though, after that day in the hospital. There hadn\u2019t been words that could bring comfort, really, nothing that wasn\u2019t cliched, nothing that could ease the loss of a wife and mother. But he\u2019d tried. He\u2019d <i>tried</i>. That was the thought Peter clung to every time he caught his uncle bad mouthing his father, or during those dark moments after \u00a0Ben and May had been given full custody, leaving him to wonder what kind of father abandoned his child. Stephen had tried, had sat up with him many, many nights, comforting Peter when he\u2019d needed it even as he turned inward on himself, becoming more and more obsessed with fixing his hands. \u00a0</p><p>Stephen <i>tried</i>. And Peter still clung to that.</p><p>This breakdown was somewhere between his two previous ones. Swift like his first, but stealthy like it had been with Ben\u2019s death. And similar to the latter, it took Aunt May\u2019s gentle presence for him to see it.</p><p>The weekend had gone by as empty motions, vaguely existing in his space without really observing it. Peter made an attempt at doing his homework, though what he did and which subjects he\u2019d studied he couldn\u2019t say. He cleaned up a bit, and fed his cat, Boots, and his leopard gecko, Lizzie; Literal creature comforts that had been by his side since he\u2019d moved in. As far as Peter was concerned, he was doing pretty damn well. He was coping. He was existing.</p><p>Then Monday came and he just&hellip;didn\u2019t get out of bed.</p><p>Well, he <i>did</i>, but barely, crawling out from the covers after seven, he did his bathroom business, fed Boots and Lizzie, and then went back to his room. He stopped and stared at the backpack in the corner blankly. Emptily. And then he fell back in bed.</p><p>A soft hand shaking his shoulder brought Peter to consciousness sometime later, though consciousness was something of a relative term. Blinking his bleary eyes to remove the crustiness, he glanced up at Aunt May\u2019s worried countenance.</p><p>\u201cHey, Peter.\u201d</p><p>Peter sat up, dislodging Boots from his place halfway on his shoulder. The tuxedo cat gave an indignant mewl before wandering towards the foot of the bed.</p><p>\u201cHey, May. What are you doing home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe school called. They told me you didn\u2019t show up?\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded slowly, his stomach curdling at the expression that action produced on May\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you, Peter? You\u2019ve been upset for days now, and I\u2019ve been trying to give you space, because I know I can be a helicopter parent sometimes when I\u2019m worried, but-\u201d Her lips twitched down, and she sucked in a sharp breath through her nose. \u201cI can tell this is more than typical teenage angst. So spill.\u201d</p><p>Nibbling at his lip, Peter hesitated. \u201cI&hellip;I really didn\u2019t want to make you worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your aunt, that\u2019s my prerogative.\u201d</p><p>Peter fumbled with the sheets in his hands. He couldn\u2019t bear to look Aunt May in the eye, knowing what her reaction was bound to be.</p><p>\u201cI&hellip;saw my dad again.\u201d</p><p>Though he couldn\u2019t see her face, her reaction was palpable: A soft intake of breath, and her body stiffened next to his.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn Friday, when I was&hellip;on my way back from school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean when you went for a Spiderman detour.\u201d</p><p>Peter winced. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Aunt May tapped an erratic beat on her knee. Reaching out with her other hand, she brushed it through Peter\u2019s hair. \u201cDo you want to tell me about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt..really wasn\u2019t anything special,\u201d \u00a0God, he <i>hated </i>to lie to her, but&hellip;he just couldn\u2019t, not yet. He didn\u2019t even know anything yet, still waiting anxiously for Tony\u2019s response. What possible good would it do to tell her that his father might have faked his death? \u201cIt was just a&hellip;pretty average bad guy, you know?\u201d Aside from the whole Eldritch Horror element of course, but he didn\u2019t say that. \u201cBut afterward, I saw dad&hellip;just walking by in the crowd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike your old&hellip;visions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, pretty much&hellip;\u201d</p><p>Chewing on her lip, Aunt May glanced away, staring sightlessly out the window. Something deep in Peter\u2019s stomach ached at the expression on her face. This kind of distant look in her eyes was exactly why he had tried to spare her from his escapades as Spiderman, why he had been so determined to keep her from finding out about his dad until he was certain about what was going on. She tried so hard to hide it, but she had lost just as much as Peter, if not more, and he knew how hard it was for her to let him do the risky stuff he did. She never tried to stop him or change him, though. She accepted him and worked so hard to support him, even in times like this when it was hard.</p><p>The least he could do was spare her a little heartache, at least until he had no choice.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, Aunt May, there..really isn\u2019t anything to say about it. I\u2019m fine, really. I just&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard, I know.\u201d She brushed back his hair again. \u201cBut please, promise you\u2019ll tell me if you have any more visions of him, okay?\u201d</p><p>If Peter was right and his father <i>was\u00a0</i>alive, then that at least he could guarantee. \u201cI will. I promise.\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>Aunt May left the room not long after, and Peter returned to his quiet contemplation. He\u2019d debated asking her questions about his dad, but ultimately left it alone, knowing what he was hoping to hear, what he wanted to find, but positive opinions of his father did not seem likely to come from Aunt May\u2019s mouth. She\u2019d try, of course, but he was pretty sure he\u2019d heard all the good she had to say about him before.</p><p>Once, Peter and Ned had tried to determine their Hogwarts houses, along with everyone else they knew. Aunt May had joined them in their fervent discussion, passionately declaring her place as a Hufflepuff, and high fived Ned when he told her he was a Hufflepuff, too. Ben was definitely a Gryffindor, with his bravery and take charge attitude. Ned\u2019s parents both belonged in Ravenclaw, as did Peter\u2019s mom. May, who had befriended her during college when she had first met Ben, described her as wicked smart and the type to stay in the library for hours studying ahead of curriculum just out of sheer curiosity.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how she met your father,\u201d She told them, smiling softly at Peter as she always did when she brought up his dad. It was somewhere between distressed and regretful. \u201cHe came up to her while she was studying anatomy and offered to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, that\u2019s sweet!\u201d Ned grinned. \u201cThey fell in love while studying together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d May smirked. \u201cShe told him she didn\u2019t need his ego blocking her view of the illustrations. I\u2019m pretty sure he was smitten after that.\u201d</p><p>Peter, always eager to hear more about both his parents, cackled at May\u2019s tale. \u201cShe really \u00a0said \u00a0that to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCross my heart and hope to die,\u201d May said, doing just that with a flourish. \u201cI was there when it happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe laughed, suggested she could maybe help him instead. She turned him down flat.</p><p>They ended up in a class together the next semester, though, and she warmed up to him. By the end of the year, they were inseparable.\u201d</p><p>Later, after Ned had left and Peter was climbing into bed, he\u2019d asked May if his dad was a Ravenclaw, too.</p><p>\u201cHe was really smart,\u201d she\u2019d said. \u201cProbably the smartest person I\u2019ve ever met. Don\u2019t tell Ben that! But&hellip;he was also really ambitious. Really, <i>really </i>ambitious. I think he\u2019d be more of a Slytherin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I might be a Slytherin, too?\u201d</p><p>May had laughed at that, and poked his stomach until he joined her. \u201cNo, I think you\u2019re my little Hufflepuff.\u201d</p><p>The pronouncement had upset Peter enough to bring tears to his eyes, which May, in her eternally understand way, had quickly shushed with gentle reassurances.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that Peter thought May was calling his dad evil (he knew better than <i>that</i>, knew that Slytherins could be good). No, he just&hellip;really, \u00a0really wanted to be just like his dad. He knew he looked much more like his mom than his dad, looked at her soft features in the mirror every morning before school. He shared her shellfish allergy, and Aunt May\u2019s sense of humor, and Uncle Ben\u2019s determination to do the right thing at all costs. But, what really did he have from his dad?</p><p>A few wispy memories and a broken watch.</p><p>That had been his goal, for as long as Peter could remember. To have more from his father, to understand who the man was, share something with him. Now, though\u2026.</p><p>Peter found himself slipping on his mask and asking Karen to play the frozen image of his father on Bleecker Street, wondering as he did if he\u2019d wasted his ambitions.</p><p><br/></p><p>***</p><p>So for anyone wondering at the reveal of Peter&rsquo;s father: I never intended for his identity to be a central mystery to this story. More of a red herring mystery, if you will. There is a lot more going on here behind the scenes to focus on&hellip;</p><p>I also indulged myself a bit. Boots and Lizzie, the pets I gave to Peter, are the ones I lost this month.</p><p>Next chapter is &ldquo;Comfortably Numb: Part 2.&rdquo;</p>",

Is it someone else&rsquo;s body or something? Are there face stealing aliens out there like in that one movie? Are you keeping it from the public to prevent mass hysteria?&rdquo; Peter demanded, his voice rising with each question.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Whoa, whoa, whoa. Settle down, kid.&rdquo; Tony said. In his own exhaustion he had misjudged Peter&rsquo;s mental state badly, now he backtracked. &ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any face stealing aliens that I know of. I was just saying we don&rsquo;t know enough right now. I mean a face match isn&rsquo;t foolproof. &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; Mr. Stark continued, taking a seat himself and kicking his feet up on the desk. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s complicated by this freaky world you and I live in. Nothing is simple for us anymore. Sure, that guy looks a hell of a lot like your dad, he probably has the same face, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean he <i>is&nbsp;</i>your dad. As sick and twisted as it is, maybe some dipshit maybe trying to get to you by posing as your dad.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Peter interrupted, &ldquo;how would they know to pretend to be my father?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the downside to being a hero, it means you end up with enemies like that Toomes guys.

I can&rsquo;t just wait-&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; Mr. Stark&rsquo;s tone was blunt, but not unkind. &ldquo;Hell, what can either of us do that Friday can&rsquo;t at this point? In an hour Fri can process more information than you or I could in a month.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Peter hesitated, but sullenly nodded his acceptance.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;And no lone-wolfing it behind my back, either,&rdquo; Tony added, with a knowing look.</p>\n<p>Peter made a sound of complaint, but one look from Mr. Stark and he backed off. They both knew Tony was right.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I just&hellip;shouldn&rsquo;t I be involved in finding him?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You will be,&rdquo; Mr. Stark responded, standing from his seat and stretching.

You look awful.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The ghost of a smile graced Peter&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;Okay.

There&rsquo;s a haughtiness in the smirk his father gives the camera, in stark contrast to his mother&rsquo;s soft smile and Peter&rsquo;s own boyish grin. Despite knowing better, he&rsquo;s always found his father looked stiff and unapproachable, and so distant from the woman at his side and the child they share. It&rsquo;s an illusion compounded by the lack of resemblance to his father, who is all angles and harsh lines; Peter has always taken more after his mother&rsquo;s side, with rounded faces and full cheeks, and the same floppy brown hair.

It <i>had\u00a0</i>been kind of\u2026a dramatic couple of days, to put it lightly. \u2018To put it lightly\u2019 even felt like an insufficient qualifier. And really, like Mr. Stark had said, what could he do that Friday couldn\u2019t? He knew he was much better off spending his time on homework than sitting around a lab, twiddling his thumbs while the super A.I worked her magic under Mr. Stark\u2019s guiding hand.</p><p>That didn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t royally suck, though.</p><p>At first, Peter attempted to procrastinate on his homework. Cleaning the kitchen, vacuuming and mopping the floors, checking in on the building owner to see if she wanted any assistance. She didn\u2019t, but she did offer him cookies and tea, and he spent a surprisingly pleasant hour listening to her gossip about two of her tenants. Afterward, he returned to the apartment and spent another couple of hours wasting time online. Looking at Tumblr (more Avengers gossip, rumors about a Buffy the Vampire Slayer reboot, a post about Tony Stark\u2019s role in the Avengers Civil War that Peter had to take a few minutes to explain all the reasons why the poster was wrong). Checking his email (Amazon deals, New to Redbox, Science Mag Daily, an offer for an internship with New York Hall of Science, an offer for an internship with Timely Pharmaceuticals, most of which he ignored aside from the NYHoS which could prove interesting). Falling into a loop of YouTube videos (Maru in a Box, Grumpy Cat, Best Cat Vines, Best Dog Vines, a dog dancing with his owner to an Irish jig). Eventually, though, he was forced to accept the inevitable and pull up his homework list.</p><p>Peter spent the rest of Saturday studying for his Spanish exam. Or, rather, \u00a0attempting to study for his Spanish exam. As hard as he tried, it was impossible to focus completely on anything. Compartmentalizing was the key, as Mr. Stark had told him once during one of their engineering tutoring sessions. Sometimes, when you had a ton of big things coming at you, you had to compartmentalize in order to deal with them without losing your mind. Take on one big thing at a time, and put the rest on the back burner until you could handle them. He didn\u2019t think Mr. Stark was talking about big things like finding out your supposedly dead father was actually alive- possibly -and had faked his death so he could abandon you when his mentor taught him that technique, though.</p><p>That was the thing, wasn\u2019t it? If his dad wasn\u2019t dead, then why wasn\u2019t he here? If it wasn\u2019t death, then it was abandonment, and Peter couldn\u2019t-</p><p>Letting out a breath sharply through his nose, Peter shook himself a bit, cutting off that train of thought.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, enough of that\u2026enough, just\u2026let\u2019s focus on this\u2026 \u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1 la biblioteca?\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>The funny thing about a breakdown, Peter realized, was that general consensus said they hit you all of a sudden, like being in a car crash. But Peter had some familiarity with breakdowns, and in his experience, he\u2019d found that they more resembled <i>witnessing\u00a0</i>a car crash from the outside. You could see it coming, vaguely, but time seemed to slow just enough to make you think that maybe it would be all right, up until the moment of impact. Peter\u2019s breakdown after Ben\u2019s murder was like that. Slow to build, taking over a week to hit. When it did, he didn\u2019t even notice he <i>was </i>breaking down, not until May came into his room and sat on his bed, where he\u2019d been curled up for some time. He wasn\u2019t even sure how long it had been, not until she told him it was nearly dinner and he hadn\u2019t climbed out except to use the bathroom. He\u2019d just felt\u2026cold, empty.</p><p>Although that one had been much more recent, the total numbness he\u2019d experienced made it almost immeasurable. More tangible by far was Peter\u2019s breakdown after the car crash, which came after a few days of numbness, stuck in a hospital room as he watched his father struggle to accept his catastrophic injuries. It was more brief images than anything really concrete, as to be expected for something that occurred when he was only six, but what he recalled was picture perfect; the crack as he twisted his Captain America action figure so hard as something hot burbled up into his chest that the arm came off. The faded blue of the coarse hospital blanket as he stared down at the broken toy in his lap. The sterile scent of cleanser that made his nose burn. Intense cold in his limbs, even his right leg in its cast, despite the intense <i>heat </i>in his chest and eyes. Then warmth, as long arms carefully encased him, avoiding catching him on the wires and brackets that held the hands together. His father\u2019s warm, gravelly voice as he murmured something indecipherable in his ear but comforting all the same. The only discernible words, or at least the only he could recall, were a softly spoken \u201cI\u2019m here, pal.\u201d</p><p>His father had been distant in the days after the crash, almost catatonic. He\u2019d tried, though, after that day in the hospital. There hadn\u2019t been words that could bring comfort, really, nothing that wasn\u2019t cliched, nothing that could ease the loss of a wife and mother. But he\u2019d tried. He\u2019d <i>tried</i>. That was the thought Peter clung to every time he caught his uncle bad mouthing his father, or during those dark moments after \u00a0Ben and May had been given full custody, leaving him to wonder what kind of father abandoned his child. Stephen had tried, had sat up with him many, many nights, comforting Peter when he\u2019d needed it even as he turned inward on himself, becoming more and more obsessed with fixing his hands. \u00a0</p><p>Stephen <i>tried</i>. And Peter still clung to that.</p><p>This breakdown was somewhere between his two previous ones. Swift like his first, but stealthy like it had been with Ben\u2019s death. And similar to the latter, it took Aunt May\u2019s gentle presence for him to see it.</p><p>The weekend had gone by as empty motions, vaguely existing in his space without really observing it. Peter made an attempt at doing his homework, though what he did and which subjects he\u2019d studied he couldn\u2019t say. He cleaned up a bit, and fed his cat, Boots, and his leopard gecko, Lizzie; Literal creature comforts that had been by his side since he\u2019d moved in. As far as Peter was concerned, he was doing pretty damn well. He was coping. He was existing.</p><p>Then Monday came and he just\u2026didn\u2019t get out of bed.</p><p>Well, he <i>did</i>, but barely, crawling out from the covers after seven, he did his bathroom business, fed Boots and Lizzie, and then went back to his room. He stopped and stared at the backpack in the corner blankly. Emptily. And then he fell back in bed.</p><p>A soft hand shaking his shoulder brought Peter to consciousness sometime later, though consciousness was something of a relative term. Blinking his bleary eyes to remove the crustiness, he glanced up at Aunt May\u2019s worried countenance.</p><p>\u201cHey, Peter.\u201d</p><p>Peter sat up, dislodging Boots from his place halfway on his shoulder. The tuxedo cat gave an indignant mewl before wandering towards the foot of the bed.</p><p>\u201cHey, May. What are you doing home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe school called. They told me you didn\u2019t show up?\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded slowly, his stomach curdling at the expression that action produced on May\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you, Peter? You\u2019ve been upset for days now, and I\u2019ve been trying to give you space, because I know I can be a helicopter parent sometimes when I\u2019m worried, but-\u201d Her lips twitched down, and she sucked in a sharp breath through her nose. \u201cI can tell this is more than typical teenage angst. So spill.\u201d</p><p>Nibbling at his lip, Peter hesitated. \u201cI\u2026I really didn\u2019t want to make you worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your aunt, that\u2019s my prerogative.\u201d</p><p>Peter fumbled with the sheets in his hands. He couldn\u2019t bear to look Aunt May in the eye, knowing what her reaction was bound to be.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026saw my dad again.\u201d</p><p>Though he couldn\u2019t see her face, her reaction was palpable: A soft intake of breath, and her body stiffened next to his.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn Friday, when I was\u2026on my way back from school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean when you went for a Spiderman detour.\u201d</p><p>Peter winced. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Aunt May tapped an erratic beat on her knee. Reaching out with her other hand, she brushed it through Peter\u2019s hair. \u201cDo you want to tell me about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt..really wasn\u2019t anything special,\u201d \u00a0God, he <i>hated </i>to lie to her, but\u2026he just couldn\u2019t, not yet. He didn\u2019t even know anything yet, still waiting anxiously for Tony\u2019s response. What possible good would it do to tell her that his father might have faked his death? \u201cIt was just a\u2026pretty average bad guy, you know?\u201d Aside from the whole Eldritch Horror element of course, but he didn\u2019t say that. \u201cBut afterward, I saw dad\u2026just walking by in the crowd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike your old\u2026visions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, pretty much\u2026\u201d</p><p>Chewing on her lip, Aunt May glanced away, staring sightlessly out the window. Something deep in Peter\u2019s stomach ached at the expression on her face. This kind of distant look in her eyes was exactly why he had tried to spare her from his escapades as Spiderman, why he had been so determined to keep her from finding out about his dad until he was certain about what was going on. She tried so hard to hide it, but she had lost just as much as Peter, if not more, and he knew how hard it was for her to let him do the risky stuff he did. She never tried to stop him or change him, though. She accepted him and worked so hard to support him, even in times like this when it was hard.</p><p>The least he could do was spare her a little heartache, at least until he had no choice.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, Aunt May, there..really isn\u2019t anything to say about it. I\u2019m fine, really. I just\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard, I know.\u201d She brushed back his hair again. \u201cBut please, promise you\u2019ll tell me if you have any more visions of him, okay?\u201d</p><p>If Peter was right and his father <i>was\u00a0</i>alive, then that at least he could guarantee. \u201cI will. I promise.\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>Aunt May left the room not long after, and Peter returned to his quiet contemplation. He\u2019d debated asking her questions about his dad, but ultimately left it alone, knowing what he was hoping to hear, what he wanted to find, but positive opinions of his father did not seem likely to come from Aunt May\u2019s mouth. She\u2019d try, of course, but he was pretty sure he\u2019d heard all the good she had to say about him before.</p><p>Once, Peter and Ned had tried to determine their Hogwarts houses, along with everyone else they knew. Aunt May had joined them in their fervent discussion, passionately declaring her place as a Hufflepuff, and high fived Ned when he told her he was a Hufflepuff, too. Ben was definitely a Gryffindor, with his bravery and take charge attitude. Ned\u2019s parents both belonged in Ravenclaw, as did Peter\u2019s mom. May, who had befriended her during college when she had first met Ben, described her as wicked smart and the type to stay in the library for hours studying ahead of curriculum just out of sheer curiosity.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how she met your father,\u201d She told them, smiling softly at Peter as she always did when she brought up his dad. It was somewhere between distressed and regretful. \u201cHe came up to her while she was studying anatomy and offered to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, that\u2019s sweet!\u201d Ned grinned. \u201cThey fell in love while studying together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d May smirked. \u201cShe told him she didn\u2019t need his ego blocking her view of the illustrations. I\u2019m pretty sure he was smitten after that.\u201d</p><p>Peter, always eager to hear more about both his parents, cackled at May\u2019s tale. \u201cShe really \u00a0said \u00a0that to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCross my heart and hope to die,\u201d May said, doing just that with a flourish. \u201cI was there when it happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe laughed, suggested she could maybe help him instead. She turned him down flat.</p><p>They ended up in a class together the next semester, though, and she warmed up to him. By the end of the year, they were inseparable.\u201d</p><p>Later, after Ned had left and Peter was climbing into bed, he\u2019d asked May if his dad was a Ravenclaw, too.</p><p>\u201cHe was really smart,\u201d she\u2019d said. \u201cProbably the smartest person I\u2019ve ever met. Don\u2019t tell Ben that! But\u2026he was also really ambitious. Really, <i>really </i>ambitious. I think he\u2019d be more of a Slytherin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I might be a Slytherin, too?\u201d</p><p>May had laughed at that, and poked his stomach until he joined her. \u201cNo, I think you\u2019re my little Hufflepuff.\u201d</p><p>The pronouncement had upset Peter enough to bring tears to his eyes, which May, in her eternally understand way, had quickly shushed with gentle reassurances.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that Peter thought May was calling his dad evil (he knew better than <i>that</i>, knew that Slytherins could be good). No, he just\u2026really, \u00a0really wanted to be just like his dad. He knew he looked much more like his mom than his dad, looked at her soft features in the mirror every morning before school. He shared her shellfish allergy, and Aunt May\u2019s sense of humor, and Uncle Ben\u2019s determination to do the right thing at all costs. But, what really did he have from his dad?</p><p>A few wispy memories and a broken watch.</p><p>That had been his goal, for as long as Peter could remember. To have more from his father, to understand who the man was, share something with him. Now, though\u2026.</p><p>Peter found himself slipping on his mask and asking Karen to play the frozen image of his father on Bleecker Street, wondering as he did if he\u2019d wasted his ambitions.</p><p><br></p><p>***</p><p>So for anyone wondering at the reveal of Peter\u2019s father: I never intended for his identity to be a central mystery to this story. More of a red herring mystery, if you will. There is a lot more going on here behind the scenes to focus on\u2026</p><p>I also indulged myself a bit. Boots and Lizzie, the pets I gave to Peter, are the ones I lost this month.</p><p>Next chapter is \u201cComfortably Numb: Part 2.\u201d</p>",

I had not intended to take so long in updating, but the last month turned out to be\u2026one of the most trying I\u2019ve had, really. Long story short, the deterioration and deaths of two beloved pets, literally hours apart, and a visit to the ER for something that I am in the process of an expected months-long recovery from, made what I thought would be a two-week delay due to a Big Bang I was a part of into much more.</p><p>On the bright side, this chapter turned into an incredibly long one, so I have decided to split it into two parts. That means you can be assured of another update next week. These two are doozies, too, so I think you all might really enjoy them. I also ended up changing the name of both parts, as much of what I thought I would be writing about is going to come up in the chapter after this two-parter.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfis9Z9B5UsLCTwEdOVR1lA\">@merelypassingtime</a> for betaing and endless encouragement.<br></p><p>Please enjoy!</p><p>\n<a href=\"https://grandraconteur.tumblr.com/post/176469742683/wish-you-were-here-chapter-1\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://grandraconteur.tumblr.com/post/176705890708/wish-you-were-here-chapter-2\">2</a> <br></p><p>Also on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15498879/chapters/37235921\">AO3</a></p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15498879/chapters/35979762\">1</a>,<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15498879/chapters/36201009#workskin\"> 2</a><br></p><p><br></p><p><i>Hello. \u00a0</i></p><p><i>Is there anybody in there?</i></p><p><i>Just nod if you can hear me.</i></p><p><i>Is there anyone home?</i></p><p>~\u201cComfortably Numb\u201d, from <i>The Wall</i>, November 30, 1979</p><p><br></p><p>92% match.</p><p>92%.</p><p>Face shape, hairline, lips, eyes, even the wrinkles in his forehead matched up. The playback footage was not quite able to pull up his eye color to match it to the one in Peter\u2019s family photo, but\u2026</p><p>\u201cThat-that\u2019s insanely high for a coincidence, right Mr. Stark?\u201d</p><p>The engineer said nothing for some time as he continued to look over Friday\u2019s analysis with a fine tooth comb. After some time, though, he nodded, almost reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, kid. That\u2019s pretty damn high.\u201d</p><p>Already tensed and on edge, that confirmation from his mentor left Peter\u2019s legs feeling like jelly.</p><p>Almost without looking, Tony put a hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder and guided him to take a seat at the desk.</p><p>\u201cSit down, kid. Don\u2019t need you falling over and cracking your head open. Your aunt would kick my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow close to fingerprint identification accuracy is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething between the 60s and 70s would within the margin of error, but something in the 90s with a decade between the images is pretty difficult to explain away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026so it\u2019s him, then?\u201d Peter questioned in a small voice.</p><p>Mr. Stark\u2019s mouth was set in a tight line, and when he spoke, his voice was gruff. \u201cI can\u2019t make any promises at this point, but\u2026yeah, it is probably his face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, it\u2019s probably his face? Is it someone else\u2019s body or something? Are there face stealing aliens out there like in that one movie? Are you keeping it from the public to prevent mass hysteria?\u201d Peter demanded, his voice rising with each question.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa. Settle down, kid.\u201d Tony said. In his own exhaustion he had misjudged Peter\u2019s mental state badly, now he backtracked. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any face stealing aliens that I know of. I was just saying we don\u2019t know enough right now. I mean a face match isn\u2019t foolproof. \u201cLook,\u201d Mr. Stark continued, taking a seat himself and kicking his feet up on the desk. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated by this freaky world you and I live in. Nothing is simple for us anymore. Sure, that guy looks a hell of a lot like your dad, he probably has the same face, but that doesn\u2019t mean he <i>is\u00a0</i>your dad. As sick and twisted as it is, maybe some dipshit maybe trying to get to you by posing as your dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d Peter interrupted, \u201chow would they know to pretend to be my father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the downside to being a hero, it means you end up with enemies like that Toomes guys. People who know who you are and aren\u2019t afraid to use your family to hurt or control you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it is someone like that, someone pretending to be my dad or something, how will we know?\u201d</p><p>The engineer crossed his arms and rested his chin on his chest. \u201cGive me a few days. I\u2019ll have Friday do some digging, see if she can track down any more appearances by your dad. See how far back his appearances go. If I can find some from before your little encounter with the radioactive spider-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-then it can\u2019t be a ploy to get to me.\u201d Peter finished for him breathlessly.</p><p>Mr. Stark smiled softly, tapping his nose with the finger of one hand and point at him with the other. \u201cYou\u2019ve got it.\u201d Looking Peter in the eye, he continued. \u201cI promise, we\u2019re going to get to the bottom of this together, but for now why don\u2019t we let Friday do her thing? You can take a load off, go home, build some lego structures with Ned, do whatever it is teenagers are doing these days for fun. Just let me and Friday carry this weight for a bit, alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, wait, but I want to help, Mr. Stark! I can\u2019t just wait-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Mr. Stark\u2019s tone was blunt, but not unkind. \u201cHell, what can either of us do that Friday can\u2019t at this point? In an hour Fri can process more information than you or I could in a month.\u201d</p><p>Peter hesitated, but sullenly nodded his acceptance.</p><p>\u201cAnd no lone-wolfing it behind my back, either,\u201d Tony added, with a knowing look.</p><p>Peter made a sound of complaint, but one look from Mr. Stark and he backed off. They both knew Tony was right.</p><p>\u201cI just\u2026shouldn\u2019t I be involved in finding him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will be,\u201d Mr. Stark responded, standing from his seat and stretching. Several parts of him popped and creaked as he did. He shot Peter a look, daring him to comment. \u201cBut right now, we have to leave it up to Friday. And you need some rest. You look awful.\u201d</p><p>The ghost of a smile graced Peter\u2019s lips. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll do my best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I ask.\u201d Mr. Stark said, handing him back the photograph.</p><p>Almost reverently, Peter takes it back, pausing for a moment to look at the image. There\u2019s a haughtiness in the smirk his father gives the camera, in stark contrast to his mother\u2019s soft smile and Peter\u2019s own boyish grin. Despite knowing better, he\u2019s always found his father looked stiff and unapproachable, and so distant from the woman at his side and the child they share. It\u2019s an illusion compounded by the lack of resemblance to his father, who is all angles and harsh lines; Peter has always taken more after his mother\u2019s side, with rounded faces and full cheeks, and the same floppy brown hair. Hardly anyone that looks at it thinks they look like a family, but Peter\u2019s always thought they did, anyway. They <i>were</i>, it just wasn\u2019t always easy to see from the outside.</p><p>Tucking away the photograph, Peter offered Mr. Stark a quick salute before heading towards the elevator. As Peter stepped in, Mr. Stark spoke up.</p><p>\u201cHey, one last question, kid. What\u2019s your dad\u2019s name? I want to see if I can cross reference it with pictures if Friday finds any.\u201d</p><p>Shifting his backpack a bit higher on his shoulder in a nervous gesture, Peter replied, \u201cHis name was\u2026is, I guess, Stephen Strange. Doctor Stephen Strange, if that helps. He\u2019s a neurosurgeon.\u201d</p><p>The last thing Peter saw as the elevator doors closed was a curious quirk of Mr. Stark\u2019s eyebrow.</p>[[MORE]]<p>***</p><p>Sitting around and doing nothing for three days did not sit well with Peter, who was much more inclined to take charge than let events unfold around him. However, in this case, Mr. Stark was probably right. It <i>had\u00a0</i>been kind of\u2026a dramatic couple of days, to put it lightly. \u2018To put it lightly\u2019 even felt like an insufficient qualifier. And really, like Mr. Stark had said, what could he do that Friday couldn\u2019t? He knew he was much better off spending his time on homework than sitting around a lab, twiddling his thumbs while the super A.I worked her magic under Mr. Stark\u2019s guiding hand.</p><p>That didn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t royally suck, though.</p><p>At first, Peter attempted to procrastinate on his homework. Cleaning the kitchen, vacuuming and mopping the floors, checking in on the building owner to see if she wanted any assistance. She didn\u2019t, but she did offer him cookies and tea, and he spent a surprisingly pleasant hour listening to her gossip about two of her tenants. Afterward, he returned to the apartment and spent another couple of hours wasting time online. Looking at Tumblr (more Avengers gossip, rumors about a Buffy the Vampire Slayer reboot, a post about Tony Stark\u2019s role in the Avengers Civil War that Peter had to take a few minutes to explain all the reasons why the poster was wrong). Checking his email (Amazon deals, New to Redbox, Science Mag Daily, an offer for an internship with New York Hall of Science, an offer for an internship with Timely Pharmaceuticals, most of which he ignored aside from the NYHoS which could prove interesting). Falling into a loop of YouTube videos (Maru in a Box, Grumpy Cat, Best Cat Vines, Best Dog Vines, a dog dancing with his owner to an Irish jig). Eventually, though, he was forced to accept the inevitable and pull up his homework list.</p><p>Peter spent the rest of Saturday studying for his Spanish exam. Or, rather, \u00a0attempting to study for his Spanish exam. As hard as he tried, it was impossible to focus completely on anything. Compartmentalizing was the key, as Mr. Stark had told him once during one of their engineering tutoring sessions. Sometimes, when you had a ton of big things coming at you, you had to compartmentalize in order to deal with them without losing your mind. Take on one big thing at a time, and put the rest on the back burner until you could handle them. He didn\u2019t think Mr. Stark was talking about big things like finding out your supposedly dead father was actually alive- possibly -and had faked his death so he could abandon you when his mentor taught him that technique, though.</p><p>That was the thing, wasn\u2019t it? If his dad wasn\u2019t dead, then why wasn\u2019t he here? If it wasn\u2019t death, then it was abandonment, and Peter couldn\u2019t-</p><p>Letting out a breath sharply through his nose, Peter shook himself a bit, cutting off that train of thought.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, enough of that\u2026enough, just\u2026let\u2019s focus on this\u2026 \u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1 la biblioteca?\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>The funny thing about a breakdown, Peter realized, was that general consensus said they hit you all of a sudden, like being in a car crash. But Peter had some familiarity with breakdowns, and in his experience, he\u2019d found that they more resembled <i>witnessing\u00a0</i>a car crash from the outside. You could see it coming, vaguely, but time seemed to slow just enough to make you think that maybe it would be all right, up until the moment of impact. Peter\u2019s breakdown after Ben\u2019s murder was like that. Slow to build, taking over a week to hit. When it did, he didn\u2019t even notice he <i>was </i>breaking down, not until May came into his room and sat on his bed, where he\u2019d been curled up for some time. He wasn\u2019t even sure how long it had been, not until she told him it was nearly dinner and he hadn\u2019t climbed out except to use the bathroom. He\u2019d just felt\u2026cold, empty.</p><p>Although that one had been much more recent, the total numbness he\u2019d experienced made it almost immeasurable. More tangible by far was Peter\u2019s breakdown after the car crash, which came after a few days of numbness, stuck in a hospital room as he watched his father struggle to accept his catastrophic injuries. It was more brief images than anything really concrete, as to be expected for something that occurred when he was only six, but what he recalled was picture perfect; the crack as he twisted his Captain America action figure so hard as something hot burbled up into his chest that the arm came off. The faded blue of the coarse hospital blanket as he stared down at the broken toy in his lap. The sterile scent of cleanser that made his nose burn. Intense cold in his limbs, even his right leg in its cast, despite the intense <i>heat </i>in his chest and eyes. Then warmth, as long arms carefully encased him, avoiding catching him on the wires and brackets that held the hands together. His father\u2019s warm, gravelly voice as he murmured something indecipherable in his ear but comforting all the same. The only discernible words, or at least the only he could recall, were a softly spoken \u201cI\u2019m here, pal.\u201d</p><p>His father had been distant in the days after the crash, almost catatonic. He\u2019d tried, though, after that day in the hospital. There hadn\u2019t been words that could bring comfort, really, nothing that wasn\u2019t cliched, nothing that could ease the loss of a wife and mother. But he\u2019d tried. He\u2019d <i>tried</i>. That was the thought Peter clung to every time he caught his uncle bad mouthing his father, or during those dark moments after \u00a0Ben and May had been given full custody, leaving him to wonder what kind of father abandoned his child. Stephen had tried, had sat up with him many, many nights, comforting Peter when he\u2019d needed it even as he turned inward on himself, becoming more and more obsessed with fixing his hands. \u00a0</p><p>Stephen <i>tried</i>. And Peter still clung to that.</p><p>This breakdown was somewhere between his two previous ones. Swift like his first, but stealthy like it had been with Ben\u2019s death. And similar to the latter, it took Aunt May\u2019s gentle presence for him to see it.</p><p>The weekend had gone by as empty motions, vaguely existing in his space without really observing it. Peter made an attempt at doing his homework, though what he did and which subjects he\u2019d studied he couldn\u2019t say. He cleaned up a bit, and fed his cat, Boots, and his leopard gecko, Lizzie; Literal creature comforts that had been by his side since he\u2019d moved in. As far as Peter was concerned, he was doing pretty damn well. He was coping. He was existing.</p><p>Then Monday came and he just\u2026didn\u2019t get out of bed.</p><p>Well, he <i>did</i>, but barely, crawling out from the covers after seven, he did his bathroom business, fed Boots and Lizzie, and then went back to his room. He stopped and stared at the backpack in the corner blankly. Emptily. And then he fell back in bed.</p><p>A soft hand shaking his shoulder brought Peter to consciousness sometime later, though consciousness was something of a relative term. Blinking his bleary eyes to remove the crustiness, he glanced up at Aunt May\u2019s worried countenance.</p><p>\u201cHey, Peter.\u201d</p><p>Peter sat up, dislodging Boots from his place halfway on his shoulder. The tuxedo cat gave an indignant mewl before wandering towards the foot of the bed.</p><p>\u201cHey, May. What are you doing home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe school called. They told me you didn\u2019t show up?\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded slowly, his stomach curdling at the expression that action produced on May\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you, Peter? You\u2019ve been upset for days now, and I\u2019ve been trying to give you space, because I know I can be a helicopter parent sometimes when I\u2019m worried, but-\u201d Her lips twitched down, and she sucked in a sharp breath through her nose. \u201cI can tell this is more than typical teenage angst. So spill.\u201d</p><p>Nibbling at his lip, Peter hesitated. \u201cI\u2026I really didn\u2019t want to make you worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your aunt, that\u2019s my prerogative.\u201d</p><p>Peter fumbled with the sheets in his hands. He couldn\u2019t bear to look Aunt May in the eye, knowing what her reaction was bound to be.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026saw my dad again.\u201d</p><p>Though he couldn\u2019t see her face, her reaction was palpable: A soft intake of breath, and her body stiffened next to his.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn Friday, when I was\u2026on my way back from school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean when you went for a Spiderman detour.\u201d</p><p>Peter winced. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Aunt May tapped an erratic beat on her knee. Reaching out with her other hand, she brushed it through Peter\u2019s hair. \u201cDo you want to tell me about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt..really wasn\u2019t anything special,\u201d \u00a0God, he <i>hated </i>to lie to her, but\u2026he just couldn\u2019t, not yet. He didn\u2019t even know anything yet, still waiting anxiously for Tony\u2019s response. What possible good would it do to tell her that his father might have faked his death? \u201cIt was just a\u2026pretty average bad guy, you know?\u201d Aside from the whole Eldritch Horror element of course, but he didn\u2019t say that. \u201cBut afterward, I saw dad\u2026just walking by in the crowd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike your old\u2026visions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, pretty much\u2026\u201d</p><p>Chewing on her lip, Aunt May glanced away, staring sightlessly out the window. Something deep in Peter\u2019s stomach ached at the expression on her face. This kind of distant look in her eyes was exactly why he had tried to spare her from his escapades as Spiderman, why he had been so determined to keep her from finding out about his dad until he was certain about what was going on. She tried so hard to hide it, but she had lost just as much as Peter, if not more, and he knew how hard it was for her to let him do the risky stuff he did. She never tried to stop him or change him, though. She accepted him and worked so hard to support him, even in times like this when it was hard.</p><p>The least he could do was spare her a little heartache, at least until he had no choice.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, Aunt May, there..really isn\u2019t anything to say about it. I\u2019m fine, really. I just\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard, I know.\u201d She brushed back his hair again. \u201cBut please, promise you\u2019ll tell me if you have any more visions of him, okay?\u201d</p><p>If Peter was right and his father <i>was\u00a0</i>alive, then that at least he could guarantee. \u201cI will. I promise.\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>Aunt May left the room not long after, and Peter returned to his quiet contemplation. He\u2019d debated asking her questions about his dad, but ultimately left it alone, knowing what he was hoping to hear, what he wanted to find, but positive opinions of his father did not seem likely to come from Aunt May\u2019s mouth. She\u2019d try, of course, but he was pretty sure he\u2019d heard all the good she had to say about him before.</p><p>Once, Peter and Ned had tried to determine their Hogwarts houses, along with everyone else they knew. Aunt May had joined them in their fervent discussion, passionately declaring her place as a Hufflepuff, and high fived Ned when he told her he was a Hufflepuff, too. Ben was definitely a Gryffindor, with his bravery and take charge attitude. Ned\u2019s parents both belonged in Ravenclaw, as did Peter\u2019s mom. May, who had befriended her during college when she had first met Ben, described her as wicked smart and the type to stay in the library for hours studying ahead of curriculum just out of sheer curiosity.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how she met your father,\u201d She told them, smiling softly at Peter as she always did when she brought up his dad. It was somewhere between distressed and regretful. \u201cHe came up to her while she was studying anatomy and offered to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, that\u2019s sweet!\u201d Ned grinned. \u201cThey fell in love while studying together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d May smirked. \u201cShe told him she didn\u2019t need his ego blocking her view of the illustrations. I\u2019m pretty sure he was smitten after that.\u201d</p><p>Peter, always eager to hear more about both his parents, cackled at May\u2019s tale. \u201cShe really \u00a0said \u00a0that to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCross my heart and hope to die,\u201d May said, doing just that with a flourish. \u201cI was there when it happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe laughed, suggested she could maybe help him instead. She turned him down flat.</p><p>They ended up in a class together the next semester, though, and she warmed up to him. By the end of the year, they were inseparable.\u201d</p><p>Later, after Ned had left and Peter was climbing into bed, he\u2019d asked May if his dad was a Ravenclaw, too.</p><p>\u201cHe was really smart,\u201d she\u2019d said. \u201cProbably the smartest person I\u2019ve ever met. Don\u2019t tell Ben that! But\u2026he was also really ambitious. Really, <i>really </i>ambitious. I think he\u2019d be more of a Slytherin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I might be a Slytherin, too?\u201d</p><p>May had laughed at that, and poked his stomach until he joined her. \u201cNo, I think you\u2019re my little Hufflepuff.\u201d</p><p>The pronouncement had upset Peter enough to bring tears to his eyes, which May, in her eternally understand way, had quickly shushed with gentle reassurances.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that Peter thought May was calling his dad evil (he knew better than <i>that</i>, knew that Slytherins could be good). No, he just\u2026really, \u00a0really wanted to be just like his dad. He knew he looked much more like his mom than his dad, looked at her soft features in the mirror every morning before school. He shared her shellfish allergy, and Aunt May\u2019s sense of humor, and Uncle Ben\u2019s determination to do the right thing at all costs. But, what really did he have from his dad?</p><p>A few wispy memories and a broken watch.</p><p>That had been his goal, for as long as Peter could remember. To have more from his father, to understand who the man was, share something with him. Now, though\u2026.</p><p>Peter found himself slipping on his mask and asking Karen to play the frozen image of his father on Bleecker Street, wondering as he did if he\u2019d wasted his ambitions.</p><p><br></p><p>***</p><p>So for anyone wondering at the reveal of Peter\u2019s father: I never intended for his identity to be a central mystery to this story. More of a red herring mystery, if you will. There is a lot more going on here behind the scenes to focus on\u2026</p><p>I also indulged myself a bit. Boots and Lizzie, the pets I gave to Peter, are the ones I lost this month.</p><p>Next chapter is \u201cComfortably Numb: Part 2.\u201d</p>",
                "content": "<p>I&rsquo;m baaaaack.</p><p>First, I have to start with a profound apology. I had not intended to take so long in updating, but the last month turned out to be&hellip;one of the most trying I&rsquo;ve had, really. Long story short, the deterioration and deaths of two beloved pets, literally hours apart, and a visit to the ER for something that I am in the process of an expected months-long recovery from, made what I thought would be a two-week delay due to a Big Bang I was a part of into much more.</p><p>On the bright side, this chapter turned into an incredibly long one, so I have decided to split it into two parts. That means you can be assured of another update next week. These two are doozies, too, so I think you all might really enjoy them. I also ended up changing the name of both parts, as much of what I thought I would be writing about is going to come up in the chapter after this two-parter.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfis9Z9B5UsLCTwEdOVR1lA\">@merelypassingtime</a> for betaing and endless encouragement.<br /></p><p>Please enjoy!</p><p>\n<a href=\"https://grandraconteur.tumblr.com/post/176469742683/wish-you-were-here-chapter-1\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://grandraconteur.tumblr.com/post/176705890708/wish-you-were-here-chapter-2\">2</a> <br /></p><p>Also on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15498879/chapters/37235921\">AO3</a></p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15498879/chapters/35979762\">1</a>,<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15498879/chapters/36201009#workskin\"> 2</a><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><i>Hello. &nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Is there anybody in there?</i></p><p><i>Just nod if you can hear me.</i></p><p><i>Is there anyone home?</i></p><p>~&ldquo;Comfortably Numb&rdquo;, from <i>The Wall</i>, November 30, 1979</p><p><br /></p><p>92% match.</p><p>92%.</p><p>Face shape, hairline, lips, eyes, even the wrinkles in his forehead matched up. The playback footage was not quite able to pull up his eye color to match it to the one in Peter&rsquo;s family photo, but&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;That-that&rsquo;s insanely high for a coincidence, right Mr. Stark?&rdquo;</p><p>The engineer said nothing for some time as he continued to look over Friday&rsquo;s analysis with a fine tooth comb. After some time, though, he nodded, almost reluctantly.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, kid. That&rsquo;s pretty damn high.&rdquo;</p><p>Already tensed and on edge, that confirmation from his mentor left Peter&rsquo;s legs feeling like jelly.</p><p>Almost without looking, Tony put a hand on Peter&rsquo;s shoulder and guided him to take a seat at the desk.</p><p>&ldquo;Sit down, kid. Don&rsquo;t need you falling over and cracking your head open. Your aunt would kick my ass.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How close to fingerprint identification accuracy is that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Something between the 60s and 70s would within the margin of error, but something in the 90s with a decade between the images is pretty difficult to explain away.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip;so it&rsquo;s him, then?&rdquo; Peter questioned in a small voice.</p><p>Mr. Stark&rsquo;s mouth was set in a tight line, and when he spoke, his voice was gruff. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make any promises at this point, but&hellip;yeah, it is probably his face.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean, it&rsquo;s probably his face? Is it someone else&rsquo;s body or something? Are there face stealing aliens out there like in that one movie? Are you keeping it from the public to prevent mass hysteria?&rdquo; Peter demanded, his voice rising with each question.</p><p>&ldquo;Whoa, whoa, whoa. Settle down, kid.&rdquo; Tony said. In his own exhaustion he had misjudged Peter&rsquo;s mental state badly, now he backtracked. &ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any face stealing aliens that I know of. I was just saying we don&rsquo;t know enough right now. I mean a face match isn&rsquo;t foolproof. &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; Mr. Stark continued, taking a seat himself and kicking his feet up on the desk. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s complicated by this freaky world you and I live in. Nothing is simple for us anymore. Sure, that guy looks a hell of a lot like your dad, he probably has the same face, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean he <i>is&nbsp;</i>your dad. As sick and twisted as it is, maybe some dipshit maybe trying to get to you by posing as your dad.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Peter interrupted, &ldquo;how would they know to pretend to be my father?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the downside to being a hero, it means you end up with enemies like that Toomes guys. People who know who you are and aren&rsquo;t afraid to use your family to hurt or control you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If it is someone like that, someone pretending to be my dad or something, how will we know?&rdquo;</p><p>The engineer crossed his arms and rested his chin on his chest. &ldquo;Give me a few days. I&rsquo;ll have Friday do some digging, see if she can track down any more appearances by your dad. See how far back his appearances go. If I can find some from before your little encounter with the radioactive spider-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;-then it can&rsquo;t be a ploy to get to me.&rdquo; Peter finished for him breathlessly.</p><p>Mr. Stark smiled softly, tapping his nose with the finger of one hand and point at him with the other. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got it.&rdquo; Looking Peter in the eye, he continued. &ldquo;I promise, we&rsquo;re going to get to the bottom of this together, but for now why don&rsquo;t we let Friday do her thing? You can take a load off, go home, build some lego structures with Ned, do whatever it is teenagers are doing these days for fun. Just let me and Friday carry this weight for a bit, alright?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, wait, but I want to help, Mr. Stark! I can&rsquo;t just wait-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; Mr. Stark&rsquo;s tone was blunt, but not unkind. &ldquo;Hell, what can either of us do that Friday can&rsquo;t at this point? In an hour Fri can process more information than you or I could in a month.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter hesitated, but sullenly nodded his acceptance.</p><p>&ldquo;And no lone-wolfing it behind my back, either,&rdquo; Tony added, with a knowing look.</p><p>Peter made a sound of complaint, but one look from Mr. Stark and he backed off. They both knew Tony was right.</p><p>&ldquo;I just&hellip;shouldn&rsquo;t I be involved in finding him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You will be,&rdquo; Mr. Stark responded, standing from his seat and stretching. Several parts of him popped and creaked as he did. He shot Peter a look, daring him to comment. &ldquo;But right now, we have to leave it up to Friday. And you need some rest. You look awful.&rdquo;</p><p>The ghost of a smile graced Peter&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;Okay. I&rsquo;ll do my best.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I ask.&rdquo; Mr. Stark said, handing him back the photograph.</p><p>Almost reverently, Peter takes it back, pausing for a moment to look at the image. There&rsquo;s a haughtiness in the smirk his father gives the camera, in stark contrast to his mother&rsquo;s soft smile and Peter&rsquo;s own boyish grin. Despite knowing better, he&rsquo;s always found his father looked stiff and unapproachable, and so distant from the woman at his side and the child they share. It&rsquo;s an illusion compounded by the lack of resemblance to his father, who is all angles and harsh lines; Peter has always taken more after his mother&rsquo;s side, with rounded faces and full cheeks, and the same floppy brown hair. Hardly anyone that looks at it thinks they look like a family, but Peter&rsquo;s always thought they did, anyway. They <i>were</i>, it just wasn&rsquo;t always easy to see from the outside.</p><p>Tucking away the photograph, Peter offered Mr. Stark a quick salute before heading towards the elevator. As Peter stepped in, Mr. Stark spoke up.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, one last question, kid. What&rsquo;s your dad&rsquo;s name? I want to see if I can cross reference it with pictures if Friday finds any.&rdquo;</p><p>Shifting his backpack a bit higher on his shoulder in a nervous gesture, Peter replied, &ldquo;His name was&hellip;is, I guess, Stephen Strange. Doctor Stephen Strange, if that helps. He&rsquo;s a neurosurgeon.&rdquo;</p><p>The last thing Peter saw as the elevator doors closed was a curious quirk of Mr. Stark&rsquo;s eyebrow.</p><p>***</p><p>Sitting around and doing nothing for three days did not sit well with Peter, who was much more inclined to take charge than let events unfold around him. However, in this case, Mr. Stark was probably right. It <i>had&nbsp;</i>been kind of&hellip;a dramatic couple of days, to put it lightly. &lsquo;To put it lightly&rsquo; even felt like an insufficient qualifier. And really, like Mr. Stark had said, what could he do that Friday couldn&rsquo;t? He knew he was much better off spending his time on homework than sitting around a lab, twiddling his thumbs while the super A.I worked her magic under Mr. Stark&rsquo;s guiding hand.</p><p>That didn&rsquo;t mean it didn&rsquo;t royally suck, though.</p><p>At first, Peter attempted to procrastinate on his homework. Cleaning the kitchen, vacuuming and mopping the floors, checking in on the building owner to see if she wanted any assistance. She didn&rsquo;t, but she did offer him cookies and tea, and he spent a surprisingly pleasant hour listening to her gossip about two of her tenants. Afterward, he returned to the apartment and spent another couple of hours wasting time online. Looking at Tumblr (more Avengers gossip, rumors about a Buffy the Vampire Slayer reboot, a post about Tony Stark&rsquo;s role in the Avengers Civil War that Peter had to take a few minutes to explain all the reasons why the poster was wrong). Checking his email (Amazon deals, New to Redbox, Science Mag Daily, an offer for an internship with New York Hall of Science, an offer for an internship with Timely Pharmaceuticals, most of which he ignored aside from the NYHoS which could prove interesting). Falling into a loop of YouTube videos (Maru in a Box, Grumpy Cat, Best Cat Vines, Best Dog Vines, a dog dancing with his owner to an Irish jig). Eventually, though, he was forced to accept the inevitable and pull up his homework list.</p><p>Peter spent the rest of Saturday studying for his Spanish exam. Or, rather, &nbsp;attempting to study for his Spanish exam. As hard as he tried, it was impossible to focus completely on anything. Compartmentalizing was the key, as Mr. Stark had told him once during one of their engineering tutoring sessions. Sometimes, when you had a ton of big things coming at you, you had to compartmentalize in order to deal with them without losing your mind. Take on one big thing at a time, and put the rest on the back burner until you could handle them. He didn&rsquo;t think Mr. Stark was talking about big things like finding out your supposedly dead father was actually alive- possibly -and had faked his death so he could abandon you when his mentor taught him that technique, though.</p><p>That was the thing, wasn&rsquo;t it? If his dad wasn&rsquo;t dead, then why wasn&rsquo;t he here? If it wasn&rsquo;t death, then it was abandonment, and Peter couldn&rsquo;t-</p><p>Letting out a breath sharply through his nose, Peter shook himself a bit, cutting off that train of thought.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, okay, enough of that&hellip;enough, just&hellip;let&rsquo;s focus on this&hellip; &iquest;D&oacute;nde est&aacute; la biblioteca?&rdquo;</p><p>***</p><p>The funny thing about a breakdown, Peter realized, was that general consensus said they hit you all of a sudden, like being in a car crash. But Peter had some familiarity with breakdowns, and in his experience, he&rsquo;d found that they more resembled <i>witnessing&nbsp;</i>a car crash from the outside. You could see it coming, vaguely, but time seemed to slow just enough to make you think that maybe it would be all right, up until the moment of impact. Peter&rsquo;s breakdown after Ben&rsquo;s murder was like that. Slow to build, taking over a week to hit. When it did, he didn&rsquo;t even notice he <i>was </i>breaking down, not until May came into his room and sat on his bed, where he&rsquo;d been curled up for some time. He wasn&rsquo;t even sure how long it had been, not until she told him it was nearly dinner and he hadn&rsquo;t climbed out except to use the bathroom. He&rsquo;d just felt&hellip;cold, empty.</p><p>Although that one had been much more recent, the total numbness he&rsquo;d experienced made it almost immeasurable. More tangible by far was Peter&rsquo;s breakdown after the car crash, which came after a few days of numbness, stuck in a hospital room as he watched his father struggle to accept his catastrophic injuries. It was more brief images than anything really concrete, as to be expected for something that occurred when he was only six, but what he recalled was picture perfect; the crack as he twisted his Captain America action figure so hard as something hot burbled up into his chest that the arm came off. The faded blue of the coarse hospital blanket as he stared down at the broken toy in his lap. The sterile scent of cleanser that made his nose burn. Intense cold in his limbs, even his right leg in its cast, despite the intense <i>heat </i>in his chest and eyes. Then warmth, as long arms carefully encased him, avoiding catching him on the wires and brackets that held the hands together. His father&rsquo;s warm, gravelly voice as he murmured something indecipherable in his ear but comforting all the same. The only discernible words, or at least the only he could recall, were a softly spoken &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here, pal.&rdquo;</p><p>His father had been distant in the days after the crash, almost catatonic. He&rsquo;d tried, though, after that day in the hospital. There hadn&rsquo;t been words that could bring comfort, really, nothing that wasn&rsquo;t cliched, nothing that could ease the loss of a wife and mother. But he&rsquo;d tried. He&rsquo;d <i>tried</i>. That was the thought Peter clung to every time he caught his uncle bad mouthing his father, or during those dark moments after &nbsp;Ben and May had been given full custody, leaving him to wonder what kind of father abandoned his child. Stephen had tried, had sat up with him many, many nights, comforting Peter when he&rsquo;d needed it even as he turned inward on himself, becoming more and more obsessed with fixing his hands. &nbsp;</p><p>Stephen <i>tried</i>. And Peter still clung to that.</p><p>This breakdown was somewhere between his two previous ones. Swift like his first, but stealthy like it had been with Ben&rsquo;s death. And similar to the latter, it took Aunt May&rsquo;s gentle presence for him to see it.</p><p>The weekend had gone by as empty motions, vaguely existing in his space without really observing it. Peter made an attempt at doing his homework, though what he did and which subjects he&rsquo;d studied he couldn&rsquo;t say. He cleaned up a bit, and fed his cat, Boots, and his leopard gecko, Lizzie; Literal creature comforts that had been by his side since he&rsquo;d moved in. As far as Peter was concerned, he was doing pretty damn well. He was coping. He was existing.</p><p>Then Monday came and he just&hellip;didn&rsquo;t get out of bed.</p><p>Well, he <i>did</i>, but barely, crawling out from the covers after seven, he did his bathroom business, fed Boots and Lizzie, and then went back to his room. He stopped and stared at the backpack in the corner blankly. Emptily. And then he fell back in bed.</p><p>A soft hand shaking his shoulder brought Peter to consciousness sometime later, though consciousness was something of a relative term. Blinking his bleary eyes to remove the crustiness, he glanced up at Aunt May&rsquo;s worried countenance.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter sat up, dislodging Boots from his place halfway on his shoulder. The tuxedo cat gave an indignant mewl before wandering towards the foot of the bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, May. What are you doing home?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The school called. They told me you didn&rsquo;t show up?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nodded slowly, his stomach curdling at the expression that action produced on May&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up with you, Peter? You&rsquo;ve been upset for days now, and I&rsquo;ve been trying to give you space, because I know I can be a helicopter parent sometimes when I&rsquo;m worried, but-&rdquo; Her lips twitched down, and she sucked in a sharp breath through her nose. &ldquo;I can tell this is more than typical teenage angst. So spill.&rdquo;</p><p>Nibbling at his lip, Peter hesitated. &ldquo;I&hellip;I really didn&rsquo;t want to make you worry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m your aunt, that&rsquo;s my prerogative.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter fumbled with the sheets in his hands. He couldn&rsquo;t bear to look Aunt May in the eye, knowing what her reaction was bound to be.</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;saw my dad again.&rdquo;</p><p>Though he couldn&rsquo;t see her face, her reaction was palpable: A soft intake of breath, and her body stiffened next to his.</p><p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On Friday, when I was&hellip;on my way back from school.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You mean when you went for a Spiderman detour.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter winced. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>Aunt May tapped an erratic beat on her knee. Reaching out with her other hand, she brushed it through Peter&rsquo;s hair. &ldquo;Do you want to tell me about it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It..really wasn&rsquo;t anything special,&rdquo; &nbsp;God, he <i>hated </i>to lie to her, but&hellip;he just couldn&rsquo;t, not yet. He didn&rsquo;t even know anything yet, still waiting anxiously for Tony&rsquo;s response. What possible good would it do to tell her that his father might have faked his death? &ldquo;It was just a&hellip;pretty average bad guy, you know?&rdquo; Aside from the whole Eldritch Horror element of course, but he didn&rsquo;t say that. &ldquo;But afterward, I saw dad&hellip;just walking by in the crowd.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like your old&hellip;visions?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, yeah, pretty much&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Chewing on her lip, Aunt May glanced away, staring sightlessly out the window. Something deep in Peter&rsquo;s stomach ached at the expression on her face. This kind of distant look in her eyes was exactly why he had tried to spare her from his escapades as Spiderman, why he had been so determined to keep her from finding out about his dad until he was certain about what was going on. She tried so hard to hide it, but she had lost just as much as Peter, if not more, and he knew how hard it was for her to let him do the risky stuff he did. She never tried to stop him or change him, though. She accepted him and worked so hard to support him, even in times like this when it was hard.</p><p>The least he could do was spare her a little heartache, at least until he had no choice.</p><p>&ldquo;Honestly, Aunt May, there..really isn&rsquo;t anything to say about it. I&rsquo;m fine, really. I just&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard, I know.&rdquo; She brushed back his hair again. &ldquo;But please, promise you&rsquo;ll tell me if you have any more visions of him, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>If Peter was right and his father <i>was&nbsp;</i>alive, then that at least he could guarantee. &ldquo;I will. I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>***</p><p>Aunt May left the room not long after, and Peter returned to his quiet contemplation. He&rsquo;d debated asking her questions about his dad, but ultimately left it alone, knowing what he was hoping to hear, what he wanted to find, but positive opinions of his father did not seem likely to come from Aunt May&rsquo;s mouth. She&rsquo;d try, of course, but he was pretty sure he&rsquo;d heard all the good she had to say about him before.</p><p>Once, Peter and Ned had tried to determine their Hogwarts houses, along with everyone else they knew. Aunt May had joined them in their fervent discussion, passionately declaring her place as a Hufflepuff, and high fived Ned when he told her he was a Hufflepuff, too. Ben was definitely a Gryffindor, with his bravery and take charge attitude. Ned&rsquo;s parents both belonged in Ravenclaw, as did Peter&rsquo;s mom. May, who had befriended her during college when she had first met Ben, described her as wicked smart and the type to stay in the library for hours studying ahead of curriculum just out of sheer curiosity.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how she met your father,&rdquo; She told them, smiling softly at Peter as she always did when she brought up his dad. It was somewhere between distressed and regretful. &ldquo;He came up to her while she was studying anatomy and offered to help.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aw, that&rsquo;s sweet!&rdquo; Ned grinned. &ldquo;They fell in love while studying together?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; May smirked. &ldquo;She told him she didn&rsquo;t need his ego blocking her view of the illustrations. I&rsquo;m pretty sure he was smitten after that.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter, always eager to hear more about both his parents, cackled at May&rsquo;s tale. &ldquo;She really &nbsp;said &nbsp;that to him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cross my heart and hope to die,&rdquo; May said, doing just that with a flourish. &ldquo;I was there when it happened.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What did he do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He laughed, suggested she could maybe help him instead. She turned him down flat.</p><p>They ended up in a class together the next semester, though, and she warmed up to him. By the end of the year, they were inseparable.&rdquo;</p><p>Later, after Ned had left and Peter was climbing into bed, he&rsquo;d asked May if his dad was a Ravenclaw, too.</p><p>&ldquo;He was really smart,&rdquo; she&rsquo;d said. &ldquo;Probably the smartest person I&rsquo;ve ever met. Don&rsquo;t tell Ben that! But&hellip;he was also really ambitious. Really, <i>really </i>ambitious. I think he&rsquo;d be more of a Slytherin.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think I might be a Slytherin, too?&rdquo;</p><p>May had laughed at that, and poked his stomach until he joined her. &ldquo;No, I think you&rsquo;re my little Hufflepuff.&rdquo;</p><p>The pronouncement had upset Peter enough to bring tears to his eyes, which May, in her eternally understand way, had quickly shushed with gentle reassurances.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t that Peter thought May was calling his dad evil (he knew better than <i>that</i>, knew that Slytherins could be good). No, he just&hellip;really, &nbsp;really wanted to be just like his dad. He knew he looked much more like his mom than his dad, looked at her soft features in the mirror every morning before school. He shared her shellfish allergy, and Aunt May&rsquo;s sense of humor, and Uncle Ben&rsquo;s determination to do the right thing at all costs. But, what really did he have from his dad?</p><p>A few wispy memories and a broken watch.</p><p>That had been his goal, for as long as Peter could remember. To have more from his father, to understand who the man was, share something with him. Now, though&hellip;.</p><p>Peter found himself slipping on his mask and asking Karen to play the frozen image of his father on Bleecker Street, wondering as he did if he&rsquo;d wasted his ambitions.</p><p><br /></p><p>***</p><p>So for anyone wondering at the reveal of Peter&rsquo;s father: I never intended for his identity to be a central mystery to this story. More of a red herring mystery, if you will. There is a lot more going on here behind the scenes to focus on&hellip;</p><p>I also indulged myself a bit. Boots and Lizzie, the pets I gave to Peter, are the ones I lost this month.</p><p>Next chapter is &ldquo;Comfortably Numb: Part 2.&rdquo;</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m baaaaack.</p>\n<p>First, I have to start with a profound apology. I had not intended to take so long in updating, but the last month turned out to be&hellip;one of the most trying I&rsquo;ve had, really. Long story short, the deterioration and deaths of two beloved pets, literally hours apart, and a visit to the ER for something that I am in the process of an expected months-long recovery from, made what I thought would be a two-week delay due to a Big Bang I was a part of into much more.</p>\n<p>On the bright side, this chapter turned into an incredibly long one, so I have decided to split it into two parts. That means you can be assured of another update next week. These two are doozies, too, so I think you all might really enjoy them. I also ended up changing the name of both parts, as much of what I thought I would be writing about is going to come up in the chapter after this two-parter.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfis9Z9B5UsLCTwEdOVR1lA\">@merelypassingtime</a> for betaing and endless encouragement.<br /></p>\n<p>Please enjoy!</p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://grandraconteur.tumblr.com/post/176469742683/wish-you-were-here-chapter-1\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://grandraconteur.tumblr.com/post/176705890708/wish-you-were-here-chapter-2\">2</a> <br /></p>\n<p>Also on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15498879/chapters/37235921\">AO3</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15498879/chapters/35979762\">1</a>,<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15498879/chapters/36201009#workskin\"> 2</a><br /></p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><i>Hello. &nbsp;</i></p>\n<p><i>Is there anybody in there?</i></p>\n<p><i>Just nod if you can hear me.</i></p>\n<p><i>Is there anyone home?</i></p>\n<p>~&ldquo;Comfortably Numb&rdquo;, from <i>The Wall</i>, November 30, 1979</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>92% match.</p>\n<p>92%.</p>\n<p>Face shape, hairline, lips, eyes, even the wrinkles in his forehead matched up. The playback footage was not quite able to pull up his eye color to match it to the one in Peter&rsquo;s family photo, but&hellip;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That-that&rsquo;s insanely high for a coincidence, right Mr. Stark?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The engineer said nothing for some time as he continued to look over Friday&rsquo;s analysis with a fine tooth comb. After some time, though, he nodded, almost reluctantly.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah, kid. That&rsquo;s pretty damn high.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Already tensed and on edge, that confirmation from his mentor left Peter&rsquo;s legs feeling like jelly.</p>\n<p>Almost without looking, Tony put a hand on Peter&rsquo;s shoulder and guided him to take a seat at the desk.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Sit down, kid. Don&rsquo;t need you falling over and cracking your head open. Your aunt would kick my ass.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;How close to fingerprint identification accuracy is that?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Something between the 60s and 70s would within the margin of error, but something in the 90s with a decade between the images is pretty difficult to explain away.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So&hellip;so it&rsquo;s him, then?&rdquo; Peter questioned in a small voice.</p>\n<p>Mr. Stark&rsquo;s mouth was set in a tight line, and when he spoke, his voice was gruff. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make any promises at this point, but&hellip;yeah, it is probably his face.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, it&rsquo;s probably his face? Is it someone else&rsquo;s body or something? Are there face stealing aliens out there like in that one movie? Are you keeping it from the public to prevent mass hysteria?&rdquo; Peter demanded, his voice rising with each question.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Whoa, whoa, whoa. Settle down, kid.&rdquo; Tony said. In his own exhaustion he had misjudged Peter&rsquo;s mental state badly, now he backtracked. &ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any face stealing aliens that I know of. I was just saying we don&rsquo;t know enough right now. I mean a face match isn&rsquo;t foolproof. &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; Mr. Stark continued, taking a seat himself and kicking his feet up on the desk. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s complicated by this freaky world you and I live in. Nothing is simple for us anymore. Sure, that guy looks a hell of a lot like your dad, he probably has the same face, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean he <i>is&nbsp;</i>your dad. As sick and twisted as it is, maybe some dipshit maybe trying to get to you by posing as your dad.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Peter interrupted, &ldquo;how would they know to pretend to be my father?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the downside to being a hero, it means you end up with enemies like that Toomes guys. People who know who you are and aren&rsquo;t afraid to use your family to hurt or control you.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If it is someone like that, someone pretending to be my dad or something, how will we know?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The engineer crossed his arms and rested his chin on his chest. &ldquo;Give me a few days. I&rsquo;ll have Friday do some digging, see if she can track down any more appearances by your dad. See how far back his appearances go. If I can find some from before your little encounter with the radioactive spider-&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;-then it can&rsquo;t be a ploy to get to me.&rdquo; Peter finished for him breathlessly.</p>\n<p>Mr. Stark smiled softly, tapping his nose with the finger of one hand and point at him with the other. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got it.&rdquo; Looking Peter in the eye, he continued. &ldquo;I promise, we&rsquo;re going to get to the bottom of this together, but for now why don&rsquo;t we let Friday do her thing? You can take a load off, go home, build some lego structures with Ned, do whatever it is teenagers are doing these days for fun. Just let me and Friday carry this weight for a bit, alright?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;No, wait, but I want to help, Mr. Stark! I can&rsquo;t just wait-&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; Mr. Stark&rsquo;s tone was blunt, but not unkind. &ldquo;Hell, what can either of us do that Friday can&rsquo;t at this point? In an hour Fri can process more information than you or I could in a month.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Peter hesitated, but sullenly nodded his acceptance.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;And no lone-wolfing it behind my back, either,&rdquo; Tony added, with a knowing look.</p>\n<p>Peter made a sound of complaint, but one look from Mr. Stark and he backed off. They both knew Tony was right.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I just&hellip;shouldn&rsquo;t I be involved in finding him?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You will be,&rdquo; Mr. Stark responded, standing from his seat and stretching. Several parts of him popped and creaked as he did. He shot Peter a look, daring him to comment. &ldquo;But right now, we have to leave it up to Friday. And you need some rest. You look awful.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The ghost of a smile graced Peter&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;Okay. I&rsquo;ll do my best.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I ask.&rdquo; Mr. Stark said, handing him back the photograph.</p>\n<p>Almost reverently, Peter takes it back, pausing for a moment to look at the image. There&rsquo;s a haughtiness in the smirk his father gives the camera, in stark contrast to his mother&rsquo;s soft smile and Peter&rsquo;s own boyish grin. Despite knowing better, he&rsquo;s always found his father looked stiff and unapproachable, and so distant from the woman at his side and the child they share. It&rsquo;s an illusion compounded by the lack of resemblance to his father, who is all angles and harsh lines; Peter has always taken more after his mother&rsquo;s side, with rounded faces and full cheeks, and the same floppy brown hair. Hardly anyone that looks at it thinks they look like a family, but Peter&rsquo;s always thought they did, anyway. They <i>were</i>, it just wasn&rsquo;t always easy to see from the outside.</p>\n<p>Tucking away the photograph, Peter offered Mr. Stark a quick salute before heading towards the elevator. As Peter stepped in, Mr. Stark spoke up.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hey, one last question, kid. What&rsquo;s your dad&rsquo;s name? I want to see if I can cross reference it with pictures if Friday finds any.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Shifting his backpack a bit higher on his shoulder in a nervous gesture, Peter replied, &ldquo;His name was&hellip;is, I guess, Stephen Strange. Doctor Stephen Strange, if that helps. He&rsquo;s a neurosurgeon.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The last thing Peter saw as the elevator doors closed was a curious quirk of Mr. Stark&rsquo;s eyebrow.</p>\n</p>",

shirt,\nnot caring too much whether he was looking his best, knowing Bruce was unlikely\nto be there.</p><p>With the directions to Scrapper\u2019s\nbar loaded on his phone, Thor made his way out. \nI was the sunniest that Thor had ever seen the city, and he did his best\nto appreciate it, but his attempt was half-hearted. \u00a0</p><p>As soon as he entered the bar, he\nwas greeted by Tony patting him on the back.</p><p>\u201cGood to see you here, point break. \u00a0Welcome to your first staff night out. \u00a0I\u2019d say be responsible and set a good example\nin case any kids are watching but then Rogers would call me a hypocrite.\u201d \u00a0Tony kept talking a Thor found himself\ndistracted by a very familiar looking bartender. \u00a0<i>She was\nthe one at the gym with Bruce. \u00a0Maybe

\u2018Hmm?\u2019 as\nhis attention went back to Tony. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDistracted by the bartender behind\nme, the one who\u2019s pretty beautiful, but in a I-could\nbeat-you-up-and-you-would-thank-me kinda way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErr,\u201d was all Thor could respond.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Val. \u00a0She\u2019s great, but she really doesn\u2019t like guys\nflirting with her on the job, so don\u2019t try that. \u00a0I heard Bruce say she\u2019s trained in boxing and\nself-defence, so, yeah, really don\u2019t try that.\u201d</p><p><i>I\ndon\u2019t want to flirt with her,</i> Thor thought, but didn\u2019t say. \u00a0<i>I want\nto ask her about what happened with Bruce.</i> \nHis stomach dropped. \u00a0<i>Or perhaps it\u2019s best not to know.</i></p><p>Tony walked Thor over to a group of\npeople he mostly recognised.</p><p>\u201cYou already know Natasha, from\nwhat I\u2019ve been hearing, Rhodey was teasing you almost as much as I have been\nlast week, so you know him. \u00a0This is\nPepper Potts, love of my life and the person number one on the list of people\nkeeping me from descending into madness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so I\u2019m number two now?\u201d \u00a0Rhodes asked. </p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re willing to make out and snuggle\nup with me and put up with my snoring every night, you might just get bumped\nback up to first.\u201d </p><p>Rhodes shook his head. </p><p>\u201cYou had to make it weird.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnyway, Pepper, this is Thor, the\nnew physics lecturer, the one that Bruce has taken a shine to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Thor.\u201d \u00a0Pepper held out her hand. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m glad Bruce likes you, he can be a little\nunwilling to socialise sometimes.\u201d \u00a0</p><p><i>He\nwasn\u2019t unwilling with me</i>, Thor thought. \n<i>He wasn\u2019t unwilling when he talked\nto me, wasn\u2019t unwilling when he kissed me.</i> \nTony interrupted his train of thought.</p><p>\u201cI was just about to go get another\nround, you want any?\u201d Thor accepted, thinking it might help him stop worrying\nabout if he\u2019d done anything wrong on his date. \n</p><p>The night was a blur after that.</p><p>It turned out that one drink wasn\u2019t\nenough to stop Thor\u2019s mind wandering back to Bruce, so he thought that perhaps\na second drink would do the trick. \u00a0When\nthat failed, he had a third. \u00a0He lost\ncount after that. \u00a0</p><p>The next day he woke with only\nfragments of the night before in his mind. \u00a0He could remember talking to Sam and Steve at\nthe bar, Sam pointing out people that he thought Steve ought to try flirting\nwith, and Steve not liking the idea at all. \nHe could remember asking Tony why he kept calling him \u2018Point Break\u2019 and\nhad a feeling that that lead to some discussion of which of Patrick Swayze\u2019s\nhaircuts was the worst. \u00a0He could\nremember talking to Val but not plucking up the courage to ask about where\nBruce had got to.</p><p>Thor tried to sit up in his bed but\nfound his hair was stuck the pillow, lifting the pillow as he raised\nhimself. \u00a0Reaching back, he found his\nhair coated in a still slightly sticky knot of bubble gum. \u00a0</p><p>He could remember watching Korg\nstart a contest over who could blow the biggest bubble. \u00a0He could remember standing a little too close\nto some creepy old man who rose to the challenge. \u00a0He could remember the old man stumbling over\ndrunk as the bubble popped and getting the bubble gum all over Thor\u2019s\nhair. \u00a0</p><p>Thor groaned. \u00a0</p><p>He was going to need a haircut. </p>",

So you do know how to answer skype after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it that you want, Loki?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy ever do you think I want something from you, couldn\u2019t I\nhave just wanted to speak to my favourite sibling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaying you prefer me to Hela isn\u2019t much of a compliment if\nyou\u2019re aiming for my good books. \u00a0But\nyou\u2019re right, I should not have been so aggressive, I\u2019m glad you finally\nreturned one of my calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, you\u2019d left me so many messages it was starting\nto get embarrassing. \u00a0Anyway, I\u2019m going\nto be in town. \u00a0You know my partner, En\nDwi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sadist who makes you call him \u2018the Grandmaster\u2019?\u201d \u00a0Loki had the good grace to look at least a\nlittle embarrassed. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s treating me to a tour of Europe, well, at least, he\u2019s\ncoming with me as his tour guide, seeing as though I know the continent\nwell. \u00a0And when I said I had a brother in\nScotland, he insisted we stop off on our way to Norway.\u201d </p><p>Thor was excited but reticent.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean I have to see <i>him</i>, as well as you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sound so put-out,\nbrother. \u00a0En Dwi has been very good to\nme.\u201d \u00a0Thor shot him a disgusted\nlook. \u00a0\u201cAnyway, we\u2019ll be coming in a\nmonth\u2019s time. \u00a0Goodbye, I\u2019ll see you\nthen.\u201d \u00a0He moved his finger to end the\ncall.</p><p>\u201cLoki?\u201d \u00a0<i>Don\u2019t\nhang up now, we\u2019ve barely talked.</i> \n\u201cLoki!\u201d Thor started to shout angrily but Loki had already hung up.</p><p>Trying to calm himself, Thor made a\ncoffee and went to his bedroom to find something appropriate for a lecturer to\nwear on a night out. \u00a0<i>It\u2019ll distract you from Bruce,</i> Thor\ntried to convince himself. \u00a0<i>I should get to know my other colleagues.</i></p><p>He put on a smart-ish grey shirt,\nnot caring too much whether he was looking his best, knowing Bruce was unlikely\nto be there.</p><p>With the directions to Scrapper\u2019s\nbar loaded on his phone, Thor made his way out. \nI was the sunniest that Thor had ever seen the city, and he did his best\nto appreciate it, but his attempt was half-hearted. \u00a0</p><p>As soon as he entered the bar, he\nwas greeted by Tony patting him on the back.</p><p>\u201cGood to see you here, point break. \u00a0Welcome to your first staff night out. \u00a0I\u2019d say be responsible and set a good example\nin case any kids are watching but then Rogers would call me a hypocrite.\u201d \u00a0Tony kept talking a Thor found himself\ndistracted by a very familiar looking bartender. \u00a0<i>She was\nthe one at the gym with Bruce. \u00a0Maybe she\nknows what went wrong. \u00a0</i>\u201c- thankfully\nwe don\u2019t have to teach tomorrow\u2026 You\u2019re not listening to a word I\u2019m saying, are\nyou?\u201d</p><p>Thor gave a questioning \u2018Hmm?\u2019 as\nhis attention went back to Tony. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDistracted by the bartender behind\nme, the one who\u2019s pretty beautiful, but in a I-could\nbeat-you-up-and-you-would-thank-me kinda way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErr,\u201d was all Thor could respond.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Val. \u00a0She\u2019s great, but she really doesn\u2019t like guys\nflirting with her on the job, so don\u2019t try that. \u00a0I heard Bruce say she\u2019s trained in boxing and\nself-defence, so, yeah, really don\u2019t try that.\u201d</p><p><i>I\ndon\u2019t want to flirt with her,</i> Thor thought, but didn\u2019t say. \u00a0<i>I want\nto ask her about what happened with Bruce.</i> \nHis stomach dropped. \u00a0<i>Or perhaps it\u2019s best not to know.</i></p><p>Tony walked Thor over to a group of\npeople he mostly recognised.</p><p>\u201cYou already know Natasha, from\nwhat I\u2019ve been hearing, Rhodey was teasing you almost as much as I have been\nlast week, so you know him. \u00a0This is\nPepper Potts, love of my life and the person number one on the list of people\nkeeping me from descending into madness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so I\u2019m number two now?\u201d \u00a0Rhodes asked. </p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re willing to make out and snuggle\nup with me and put up with my snoring every night, you might just get bumped\nback up to first.\u201d </p><p>Rhodes shook his head. </p><p>\u201cYou had to make it weird.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnyway, Pepper, this is Thor, the\nnew physics lecturer, the one that Bruce has taken a shine to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Thor.\u201d \u00a0Pepper held out her hand. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m glad Bruce likes you, he can be a little\nunwilling to socialise sometimes.\u201d \u00a0</p><p><i>He\nwasn\u2019t unwilling with me</i>, Thor thought. \n<i>He wasn\u2019t unwilling when he talked\nto me, wasn\u2019t unwilling when he kissed me.</i> \nTony interrupted his train of thought.</p><p>\u201cI was just about to go get another\nround, you want any?\u201d Thor accepted, thinking it might help him stop worrying\nabout if he\u2019d done anything wrong on his date. \n</p><p>The night was a blur after that.</p><p>It turned out that one drink wasn\u2019t\nenough to stop Thor\u2019s mind wandering back to Bruce, so he thought that perhaps\na second drink would do the trick. \u00a0When\nthat failed, he had a third. \u00a0He lost\ncount after that. \u00a0</p><p>The next day he woke with only\nfragments of the night before in his mind. \u00a0He could remember talking to Sam and Steve at\nthe bar, Sam pointing out people that he thought Steve ought to try flirting\nwith, and Steve not liking the idea at all. \nHe could remember asking Tony why he kept calling him \u2018Point Break\u2019 and\nhad a feeling that that lead to some discussion of which of Patrick Swayze\u2019s\nhaircuts was the worst. \u00a0He could\nremember talking to Val but not plucking up the courage to ask about where\nBruce had got to.</p><p>Thor tried to sit up in his bed but\nfound his hair was stuck the pillow, lifting the pillow as he raised\nhimself. \u00a0Reaching back, he found his\nhair coated in a still slightly sticky knot of bubble gum. \u00a0</p><p>He could remember watching Korg\nstart a contest over who could blow the biggest bubble. \u00a0He could remember standing a little too close\nto some creepy old man who rose to the challenge. \u00a0He could remember the old man stumbling over\ndrunk as the bubble popped and getting the bubble gum all over Thor\u2019s\nhair. \u00a0</p><p>Thor groaned. \u00a0</p><p>He was going to need a haircut. </p>",
