I had fallen asleep on the couch at Avengers Headquarters.

I didn\u2019t mean to-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d Tony says, cutting me off.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re not yourself and I can tell. Figured I would search for some answers.\u201d He asks, softening a bit.<br/></p><p>Raking my fingers through my brown waves, I sit up on the couch and ponder what to say.

She deserves to be happy after everything that happened.</p><p>\u201cI just haven\u2019t been sleeping well. It\u2019s my fault.\u201d I say through my teeth. Stark has skepticism plastered on his features and knows, by default, that I\u2019m hiding something from him.<br/></p><p>Sighing, he sits beside me and I feel my muscles tense at the close proximity,\u00a0\u201cYou know you can talk to me about anything, kid. It doesn\u2019t have to be now, but I want you to feel comfortable enough to seek me out. My father was never an approachable man&hellip;\u201d</p><p>His sentence lingers off, almost as if he\u2019s fading into a memory.

Thank you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Seeming satisfied with my answer, he stands and quietly dismisses himself from the area. Leaning back into the sofa, I think about what he said and what the endgame of this situation will be.\u00a0</p><p>Even after aunt May is long married, I will still have to deal with Lucas as he will be family. Sighing, I throw my head into my hands. Maybe confronting him about this will make my choices more clear.</p><p>After my day at Avengers Headquarters is done, I am now determined to speak to Lucas. On the way back home, I try to gather my thoughts together. The conversation could go so many ways, I\u2019m unable to know how Lucas will react.</p><p>Just as I reach the apartment building, I spot Lucas standing outside waiting for, what appears to be, me.\u00a0\u201cHey, Parker. Why are you coming home so late?\u201d He smirks, knowing what my answer would usually be.</p><p>\u201cLucas, I need to talk with you.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>My straightforward words take him by surprise and his eyes widen slightly.\u00a0\u201cAbout?\u201d He asks, voice holding a tone that\u2019s defensive already.</p><p>Standing in front of him, I feel a minor nervousness through my body. The last thing I want is for this to backfire and come back onto May. Yet, I can\u2019t continue on with the lack of sleep and constant exhaustion.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe way you speak to me and my friend is not right, Lucas. You\u2019re constantly at my back, mocking me for every decision I make and I can\u2019t take it. I do work on an internship with Mr. Stark, I do build Lego death-stars with Ned, but that\u2019s my choice. You would do well to respect that.\u201d<br/></p><p>His posture straightens and he stands a good few inches above me,\u00a0\u201cAnd calling you out on your obvious lies is my choice, Parker.\u201d He states with a dangerous glint in his eye.</p><p>My jaw clenches and I can sense the tension growing between us. Suddenly, the thick atmosphere is cut through by, none other than, Tony Stark waltzing up.\u00a0\u201cMr. Parker.\u201d He addresses, making Lucas\u2019 eyes bulge.</p><p>I probably look similarly since I hadn\u2019t expected his presence.\u00a0\u201cMr.Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCap said you forgot your laptop, so I came to drop it by.\u201d He says, handing me my bag with the device.\u00a0\u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d Looking up, I see Tony narrowing his eyes at a very nervous Lucas.<br/></p><p>\u201cThis is Lucas. He\u2019s, uh, son of Aunt May\u2019s fiance.\u201d I stutter, suddenly feeling a bit bad for the embarrassed boy.\u00a0</p><p>Tony firmly grips his hand, introducing himself.\u00a0\u201cPleasure to meet you, Lucas. I\u2019m Tony Stark. Surely Peter has told you about his internship with me.\u201d Lucas nods quickly, resembling a bobble-head.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019d like to stay for dinner, Mr. Stark.\u201d I offer, feeling relieved at the validation of my previous argument. Tony glances over at me with a smile and I can\u2019t stop myself from mirroring his actions.<br/></p><p>\u201cActually, I would. It\u2019s been a while since May and I have caught up. Plus, I need to make sure my bright apprentice is being taken care of.\u201d He looks to Lucas now, voice stern,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d like to talk to Peter for a moment, please.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOf course, Mr.Stark. Right away.\u201d With that, he vanishes through the doors and into the building beyond.<br/></p><p>Tony turns to me now, an eyebrow raised.\u00a0\u201cHow much did you hear?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cOh, only all of it.\u201d He says, crossing his arms.\u00a0\u201cBut I must say, I\u2019m proud of you for taking the step to work your own problems out. I doubt Lucas will be bothering you as much now.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThanks to you.\u201d I say, smiling.\u00a0\u201cThank you, Mr.Stark.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>He looks at me with pride and I am grateful for him watching out for me.\u00a0\u201cI told you I\u2019d be around.\u201d Nodding at him, I start to walk beside him and up to my floor.

I had fallen asleep on the couch at Avengers Headquarters. Looking up at the figure looming over me, Tony stands there with furrowed brows,\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Mr. Stark. I didn\u2019t mean to-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d Tony says, cutting me off.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re not yourself and I can tell. Figured I would search for some answers.\u201d He asks, softening a bit.<br></p><p>Raking my fingers through my brown waves, I sit up on the couch and ponder what to say. Surely Mr. Stark would go to aunt May about Lucas and I don\u2019t want to mess up her happiness. She deserves to be happy after everything that happened.</p><p>\u201cI just haven\u2019t been sleeping well. It\u2019s my fault.\u201d I say through my teeth. Stark has skepticism plastered on his features and knows, by default, that I\u2019m hiding something from him.<br></p><p>Sighing, he sits beside me and I feel my muscles tense at the close proximity,\u00a0\u201cYou know you can talk to me about anything, kid. It doesn\u2019t have to be now, but I want you to feel comfortable enough to seek me out. My father was never an approachable man\u2026\u201d</p><p>His sentence lingers off, almost as if he\u2019s fading into a memory. I watch him carefully as he clears his throat,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m here for you, kid. I just wanted you to know that.\u201d</p><p>The corner of my mouth tilts up and I shrug my shoulders a bit,\u00a0\u201cI know that, Mr. Stark. Thank you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Seeming satisfied with my answer, he stands and quietly dismisses himself from the area. Leaning back into the sofa, I think about what he said and what the endgame of this situation will be.\u00a0</p><p>Even after aunt May is long married, I will still have to deal with Lucas as he will be family. Sighing, I throw my head into my hands. Maybe confronting him about this will make my choices more clear.</p><p>After my day at Avengers Headquarters is done, I am now determined to speak to Lucas. On the way back home, I try to gather my thoughts together. The conversation could go so many ways, I\u2019m unable to know how Lucas will react.</p><p>Just as I reach the apartment building, I spot Lucas standing outside waiting for, what appears to be, me.\u00a0\u201cHey, Parker. Why are you coming home so late?\u201d He smirks, knowing what my answer would usually be.</p><p>\u201cLucas, I need to talk with you.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>My straightforward words take him by surprise and his eyes widen slightly.\u00a0\u201cAbout?\u201d He asks, voice holding a tone that\u2019s defensive already.</p><p>Standing in front of him, I feel a minor nervousness through my body. The last thing I want is for this to backfire and come back onto May. Yet, I can\u2019t continue on with the lack of sleep and constant exhaustion.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe way you speak to me and my friend is not right, Lucas. You\u2019re constantly at my back, mocking me for every decision I make and I can\u2019t take it. I do work on an internship with Mr. Stark, I do build Lego death-stars with Ned, but that\u2019s my choice. You would do well to respect that.\u201d<br></p><p>His posture straightens and he stands a good few inches above me,\u00a0\u201cAnd calling you out on your obvious lies is my choice, Parker.\u201d He states with a dangerous glint in his eye.</p><p>My jaw clenches and I can sense the tension growing between us. Suddenly, the thick atmosphere is cut through by, none other than, Tony Stark waltzing up.\u00a0\u201cMr. Parker.\u201d He addresses, making Lucas\u2019 eyes bulge.</p><p>I probably look similarly since I hadn\u2019t expected his presence.\u00a0\u201cMr.Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCap said you forgot your laptop, so I came to drop it by.\u201d He says, handing me my bag with the device.\u00a0\u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d Looking up, I see Tony narrowing his eyes at a very nervous Lucas.<br></p><p>\u201cThis is Lucas. He\u2019s, uh, son of Aunt May\u2019s fiance.\u201d I stutter, suddenly feeling a bit bad for the embarrassed boy.\u00a0</p><p>Tony firmly grips his hand, introducing himself.\u00a0\u201cPleasure to meet you, Lucas. I\u2019m Tony Stark. Surely Peter has told you about his internship with me.\u201d Lucas nods quickly, resembling a bobble-head.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019d like to stay for dinner, Mr. Stark.\u201d I offer, feeling relieved at the validation of my previous argument. Tony glances over at me with a smile and I can\u2019t stop myself from mirroring his actions.<br></p><p>\u201cActually, I would. It\u2019s been a while since May and I have caught up. Plus, I need to make sure my bright apprentice is being taken care of.\u201d He looks to Lucas now, voice stern,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d like to talk to Peter for a moment, please.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOf course, Mr.Stark. Right away.\u201d With that, he vanishes through the doors and into the building beyond.<br></p><p>Tony turns to me now, an eyebrow raised.\u00a0\u201cHow much did you hear?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cOh, only all of it.\u201d He says, crossing his arms.\u00a0\u201cBut I must say, I\u2019m proud of you for taking the step to work your own problems out. I doubt Lucas will be bothering you as much now.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThanks to you.\u201d I say, smiling.\u00a0\u201cThank you, Mr.Stark.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>He looks at me with pride and I am grateful for him watching out for me.\u00a0\u201cI told you I\u2019d be around.\u201d Nodding at him, I start to walk beside him and up to my floor. Tony gives my shoulder a reassuring squeeze as he follows me.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s go eat, kid.\u201d</p><hr><p><b><a href=\"https://echoingsquealz.tumblr.com/post/172035492794/masterlist-ellie-mae\">Masterlist Here</a></b></p><p><b><i>A/N: Sorry this request took longer than I expected!!

        "answer": "<p>Oh, wow, <a>@taylortut</a>\u200b. Ha ha. So\u2026 I <i>totally </i>planned to have this written, like, a week after you sent in the prompt. And then the <i>skeleton outline </i>of the fic was 4k and I knew I\u2019d just done myself in, and then I was all, \u201cIt can be her Christmas present!\u201d only\u2026 that didn\u2019t happen, either. But I\u2019m almost glad it didn\u2019t, because while you certainly deserve all the Christmas presents, you also <i>very </i>certainly deserve \u2018for no other reason other than you\u2019re totally awesome\u2019 presents. Because you are. Thank you for your fic and for being super, wonderfully nice to all who come across your page.

There was\ncertainly no looming figure or spaceship or giant robot promising\ndoom and destruction as the code-red call had insinuated. In fact,\nthe more they awkwardly stood in a line just off the ramp of the\nQuinjet and watched the traffic try to be more ridiculous than ever,\nthe more Clint began to suspect it was all a prank. Possibly aimed\ndirectly at him. Why else would the call to assemble to save the city\n(<i>again</i>. Damnit, New\nYork) come the <i>day </i>before\nClint was scheduled to have his quiet exit from the team so he could\nreturn to Laura and the kids?</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>He\u2019d\nunderstood why the whole team \u2013 including the We Just Helped Out\nThis One Time crew \u2013 had been asked to stay at the New\nAvengers Facility and be as\nvisible as possible in the days following the return of half the\nuniverse. The Snap, as the media had dubbed it, had been a traumatic\ntime for all, and having the world able to see the heroes they\ndepended on all in one, easily-accessable training facility\ndid a lot to help settle a skittish,traumatised Earth back into\nrhythm again. Clint had also understood why, when the almost\nlaughably large team had slowly been whittled down \u2013 person by\nperson so the public didn\u2019t panic; like weaning somebody off\ncaffeine slowly to show them that, look, you can still survive if\nyou\u2019re one cup a day fewer \u2013 to the minimal number of \u2018regulars\u2019,\nhe was one of the last on the list of scheduled exits. He whined\nabout it a little, of course, but he was smart enough to know that\nactual kings who had countries to run, Sorcerer Supremes,\nthunder-gods, still-mostly-broken\nandroids,\nnot-really-an-official-Avenger teenagers with finals to study for and\nwrite and people with a job in the US army should <i>rightfully</i>\nhave been excused before he was. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>He\nwas also just a little unsure of why Banner, who had freely admitted\nhe was going to stay at the Facility\nwhether he was off the official lineup or not, had <i>still\n</i>got excused before him. And also\nwhy the attempt to retain the most human-seeming members until last\nhad meant that the WWE-wrestler with no filter had been given leave,\nbut the smart-mouthed raccoon had been cajoled to stay. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cWell,\nsome people need time to do the villainous destructive thingies,\u201d\nRocket said, as though reading Clint\u2019s mental assessment of him and\nwillingly jumping in to prove his point. \u201cNot everybody can level a\ncity with a <i>snap of his fingers</i>.\u201d\n\n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>A\nvisible wince flowed through the group like a ripple. \u201cDude,\u201d\nQuill groaned, as Rocket snorted and muttered about it being a good\njoke. \u201cToo soon.\u201d</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nSam piped in, falsely cheerfully, \u201cbut only, like, three decades\ntoo soon, so we\u2019re all good.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cNo\nneed for Stark to give away his Inappropriate Asshole Remarks award\njust yet,\u201d Clint chimed in, because he\u2019d forgotten, for just a\nmoment, that whatever tight-knit camaraderie existed while you saved\nthe universe together faded after the first few giddy days of\nrelief-trauma. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>Clint\ngrimaced at the quickly-thickening silence that followed his remark.\nA few years ago, Stark would have filled the silence with rapid-fire\ncomebacks of his own, or somebody else would have picked up the\nribbing, and they would have gone into battle snarking and saving\neach other in equal measure. But Stark had not had the job or life\nClint had \u2013 the dual\ncombination that had taught\nhim to let some things that had happened be bygones so that everybody\ncould move on and deal with who they were and what they were doing in\n<i>that </i>moment. Stark\nseemed to put the bandaid on the wound not only to stop the bleeding,\nbut to stop anybody taking whatever was buried under his skin causing\nthe pain out of him, so he could hold it there and <i>feel </i>it\nfor forever. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cWe\nshould split up and look for signs of disturbance,\u201d Steve said in a\nlevel voice, opting to pretend the awkwardness was not near-choking.\n\u201cStar-Lord, you and Rocket go the length of the Hudson and head\ninland. Falcon, Black Widow \u2013 you two work areal and ground from\nthe Civic Centre and work your way in. Iron Man and Hawkeye, same but\nfrom the East River in. Bucky and I will go from Washington Heights\ndown. Rendezvous point is Central Park; keep in contact over the\ncoms.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat\npart of Central Park?\u201d Sam asked, probably just to be otherwise. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cThe\ncentral part of it,\u201d Steve deadpanned back as Natasha smirked.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>Stark\u2019s\nfaceplate was down by the time Clint glanced at him, and so all he\ngot was a view of flat, angry gold. Without a word, Stark fired his\nrepulsors and swooped at Clint, who was only not caught completely\noff guard because of how often he\u2019d been Stark-lifted in the past.\nAs he was jerked into the air, still in complete silence, he couldn\u2019t\nhelp but warily think back to their very first battle together.\n<i>Better clench up, Legolas</i>.\nAs annoying as Stark\u2019s babbling and needling could be, the silence\nfrom the man was\u2026 unnerving. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cGoing\ndown,\u201d Stark said, suddenly, and a moment later Clint found himself\nbeing dropped, rather roughly, onto a rooftop. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>He\nstumbled and staggered a little, but managed to stick the landing,\nbiting down on his tongue to stop himself from lashing out at Stark\nfor the obviously intentional hard drop. Stark still acted like a\npetty child, and it irked Clint to no end. Muttering to himself, he\nstarted surveying their area, making his own way over rooftops so\nthat he didn\u2019t have to rely on Stark again. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d\nStark asked a while later, out of sight in the skies somewhere. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cI\nsee two teenagers who <i>really shouldn\u2019t be doing that</i>,\u201d\nClint said, raising his voice so that the duo heard him, jumped, and\nthen scampered away guiltily. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cSaving\nthe world one unplanned pregnancy at a time,\u201d Tony said dryly. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve\nheard \u2018friendly neighbourhood hero\u2019 is the in thing, this year,\u201d\nClint fired back, eyes roving over the latest street he hovered over.\n\n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cThe\nyellow butterfly headed toward you as you ask, \u2018is this the way I\nbecome cool and relevant again?\u2019 is labelled \u2018copying a literal\nteenager\u2019.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>Clint\nblinked, hard, his train of thought suddenly crashing to a halt.\n\u201cWait, <i>what</i>?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cGuys,\nI think we found what we were called in to fight.\u201d Quill\u2019s voice\nsounded grimly bemused through the com-link. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve been at\nit for a while, looks like.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201c\u2018They\u2019,\nas in, multiple hostiles?\u201d Steve demanded. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\ndepends,\u201d Quill replied. \u201cAre you calling the magical, sentient\nvines the enemy, or the being making them appear?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cThe\nvines are <i>sentient</i>?\u201d\nSam sounded a little out of breath. \u201cHow do we know this?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cGuessed,\u201d\nRocket replied, \u201c\u2019cause deciding the vines can hit for themselves\nand being proved you were an idiot is a lot less stupid than the\nother way.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cI\nsay we agree with the guy who has a tree as a best friend,\u201d Bucky\npiped up, mildly. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cWhere\nare you two?\u201d Steve asked, and Clint caught sight of Stark heading\nhis way, ready, no doubt, to pick Clint up and take him to the battle\nscene. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cHiding\nbehind a building,\u201d Rocket said. \u201cWatching the vine-making-person\nmake vines and destroy stuff with them.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Where\n</i>is this building?\u201d Steve\nclarified. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cIn\nbetween another two. There\u2019s a Starbucks on the corner,\u201d Rocket\nsaid, helpfully. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nnear the river?\u201d Quill added. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cRiverside\nBoulevard, Lincoln Square, New York,\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y\u2019s voice chimed\nin before anybody could start to get too exasperated. \u201cHead for the\nopen patch of green just off the Joe DiMaggio Highway.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cAh,\ncrap; it <i>had </i>to be\nnear the highway,\u201d Sam sighed. \u201cThose kinds of battles <i>always\n</i>end up messy.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cStar-Lord,\nRocket \u2013 wait until you have backup to engage. First on the scene,\ntry and contain the threat before it reaches the highway,\u201d Steve\nordered. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>Once\nagain, Clint got almost no warning before Stark grabbed him and\nlifted him, somewhat painfully, into the sky. This time, the silence\nwas calculating instead of awkward; Clint was sure Stark was having\nconversations with his AI as he flew, and he himself needed the time\nto get his head around the idea of <i>sentient vines</i>.\nIt didn\u2019t take much searching to find them; they were a sickly\nyellow-green, as thick as a manhole at their smallest and already\ncausing some destruction to buildings and roads along the boulevard.\nAnd some of them had started climbing their way up the supports of\nthe highway. There was little, Clint realised, that a bow and arrow\ncould do against them, even if the arrow exploded. So his job would\nthen be Team Two: Take Out The Mad Creator. For that, he had to find\nsaid person who, according to Quill and Rocket, had given them the\nshake when they realised they were being watched. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cIron\nMan, drop me on the tallest roof around here so I can find this guy\nand take him down.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>Steve\nimmediately sorted the rest of the team into the two groups, guessing\nat Clint\u2019s intentions \u2013 Natasha and Sam were with him, while the\nrest of the team got to blow up some plants. Stark obeyed his request\nbut, once again, did so harshly, leaving Clint to skid and swear\nunder his breath at the sharp pain of impact. He turned to glare at\nthe man, but Stark was already gone. So, instead, Clint called him a\nfew choice names in his head and then set about finding his target. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d\nStark panted. \u201cThese things are more vicious than a pissed-off\nchihuahua.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cAt\nleast they don\u2019t grow back rapidly when you tear them in pieces,\u201d\nNatasha said, mildly. \u201cOr spray awful things at you. Plus, they\ndon\u2019t seem to be truly sentient \u2013 just alive enough to have a\npurpose.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cHow\u2026motivating\u2026\u201d\nStark bit back, sounding completely out of breath. \u201cHey, Black\nWidow \u2013\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nyou <i>dare </i>say you\u2019re\nbringing the party to us.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cThis\nis why\u2026I never\u2026 invite you\u2026anywhere fun,\u201d Stark panted. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>The\ntalk over the com-link reduced itself to sudden, loud exclamations of\npain or frustration and the occasional directive or query. It didn\u2019t\ntake too long for them to track down their villain of the week, but\nfinding them and being able to stop them from creating new vines or\nusing the ones already created to give the team a rather good\nthrashing turned out to be two completely different ballgames.\nClint\u2019s aim was as true as ever, but none of his arrows seemed to\nhave any effect on the vaguely humanoid being that swatted their\nattempts to reach them aside like annoying flies before continuing to\n<i>sing </i>vines from the\nearth. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>Eventually,\nNatasha managed to get close enough to ram one of her Bites onto the\nhostile\u2019s neck. They threw her off in a blast of pale-yellow light,\nbut still went down to their knees, twitching under the force of the\nweapon. Clint fired a taser arrow at the being just as they looked\nlike they were about to get to their feet, saw Natasha trying to\nfight her way out of the thick vines wrapping around her, saw Sam,\nwings thrown off, start to run toward their newly felled enemy in an\nattempt to reach them before Clint\u2019s arrow\u2019s effect wore off.\nClint knew that neither he nor Sam would reach their target in time \u2013\nthe hostile was too well protected against their attacks. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cNeed\nsome help!\u201d Sam yelled over the com, running as fast as he could\ndespite the probable futility. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cOn\nit,\u201d Stark\u2019s voice answered back, and a moment later the Iron Man\nsuit dropped like a stone from the sky, hurtling toward their\ntwitching, struggling enemy. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>Clint\nsaw Sam falter for a few steps at the sight, a mask of horror and\nfamiliarity flashing across his face before he pulled himself into\nthe <i>now </i>and continued\nrunning. Clint, too, continued his rush to reach them, half an eye on\nNat and half an eye on Stark who <i>wasn\u2019t pulling up. </i>Ten\nfeet from the ground, Clint opened his mouth to yell \u2013 what, he\nnever would have been able to say, but his heart was in his throat at\nthe sight of Stark not stopping \u2013 and, almost at the same time, the\nBleeding Edge \u00a0armour peeled away from its creator, dropping to the\nfloor faster than even he was falling like one of those fake\nslime-in-a-tubs his kids played with and creating a sort of\nfunnel-cushion that not only caught Stark as he fell but acted as a\nsort of slide, gently depositing him on his one knee and one hand\njust in front of their slowly-rising enemy. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>And,\nokay, Clint could admit it \u2013 that had been a pretty damn awesome\nmove. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>Stark\ngot to his feet, and fashioned crude restraints out of some of his\narmour. He\u2019d managed to lock down three of their enemy\u2019s four\nlimbs before the hostile, until that point still but for the twitches\nfrom the electricity, reared up and slammed their free hand to an\nunprotected area around Stark\u2019s thigh. The accompanying blast of\nlight was much brighter yellow than the one that had swatted Nat\naway, and Stark was blown backwards with a curse of surprise that was\nloud in the otherwise silence of the attack. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>Clint\ndidn\u2019t stop to see where or how Stark landed. He and Sam reached\ntheir enemy at about the same time and, with Stark\u2019s armour holding\nmost of the being in place, they made quick teamwork of finally\nknocking their target unconscious. As they slumped to the ground,\nClint drew one last taser arrow and embedded it into the inert form.\nHe wasn\u2019t taking any chances. While the electroshocks worked their\nway through their enemy and Sam readied the restraints, Clint glanced\nup to take stock of the team. Steve and Bucky were quickly picking\ntheir way around still-vicious vines, Rocket was laughing his ass off\nat Quill trying to flail out from under a miniature vine that had\nseemingly snuck up on him and Natasha was half-bent over Stark,\nbleeding slightly but steady, as Stark got carefully to his feet. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cContainment\nvehicle and medical are both on their way. Vines are giving them a\nbit of trouble,\u201d Steve reported as they all regrouped around their\nunconscious and thoroughly restrained enemy. There wasn\u2019t much to\nreply to that, so everybody just stood, getting their breath back and\nidly watching Stark retrieve his nanobots now that they were no\nlonger needed as restraints, coaxing them back around his body until\nthe armour was once again complete. \u201cI want everybody to be\nthoroughly cleared by medical before we start cleaning this mess up,\u201d\nSteve eventually said into the silence. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cUgh.\nWell this takes the fun out of saving the day,\u201d Rocket said, idly\nkicking at the tip of a vine that had been sneaking closer to him. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat\nif we just\u2026 leave them?\u201d Quill suggested. \u201cI mean, weren\u2019t\npeople going on about making New York more\u2026 ecofriendly and\n\u2018green\u2019?\u201d Behind him, there was an ominous crack as one of the\nthick vines began squeezing a support column of the highway. Quill\nsighed. \u201cYeah, okay, fine. <i>Fine</i>.\u201d\n\n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cDo\nit for the vine,\u201d Bucky said, voice and face completely deadpan. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>Natasha\nsmirked and Sam threw his head back to look at the heavens with a\ndeep sigh. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>They\nstarted hacking down some of the vines closest to their fallen enemy\nwhile they waited for medical to crawl its way over to them, and even\nwhen the three heavily armoured and manned vans arrived they all\npersonally made sure the still-unconcious being was securely\ncontained within the vehicle and that the personnel inside were aware\nthat they could not mess up and let the tough asshole get loose. Then\nthey all shuffled off to be poked and prodded by medical \u2013 some\nmore willingly than others \u2013 and Clint got to witness the rather\namusing show of a fresh-faced medical professional try and perform an\nexamination on Rocket, who obviously didn\u2019t make the process of her\nfirst genetically-engineered-raccoon examination easier on her. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>Steve\nhovered around Bucky, mostly, but then <i>casually </i>made\nhis way over to the medic who had examined Stark and had a quiet word\nwith them, obviously trusting Stark\u2019s past history with skipping\nmedical exams over the man\u2019s declaration that he was in the clear.\nAnd then, as medical trundled away \u2013 without giving them so much as\na damn lollipop for good behaviour, let alone the good dose of carbs\nthey were all probably craving \u2013 the Avengers got to work with city\ncleanup, which, despite the difficulty of hacking apart vines as\nthick as tree trunks that wanted to kill you, was still accompanied\nby memes, bad jokes about Jack and the Beanstalk and the inevitable\nfarming/harvesting cracks thrown Clint\u2019s way. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>As\nalways, the Avengers worked best as a team, each member carrying a\nspecific part of the physical and emotional labour of the task that\nbettered the effort as a whole. But Stark\u2019s repulsors were clearly\nthe winning methods of vine-destruction, managing to cleanly sever\neven the thickest vines in two or three shots where it took everybody\nelse many more. They therefore quickly and wordlessly broke into a\nproduction line \u2013 Rocket, Quill and Stark cut the vines up, and the\nrest joined with the Department of Damage Control crew to peel the\nmostly-dead plants from the infrastructure or haul the pieces into\nthe Department of Damage Control-issued containers that had arrived\nwith said crew about thirty minutes after the battle ended. The extra\nhelp, though a little star-struck in cases, was highly appreciated\nand made the going delightfully faster than Clint\u2019s tired and\nfrankly sore body and mind had predicted. So much so, in fact, that\nit began to look like they\u2019d probably be able to do most of the\ncleanup in one day <i>and </i>before\ndarkness truly fell. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>At\nfirst, Clint didn\u2019t notice that a bottleneck in the production line\nhad formed \u2013 he was focussed on pulling a truly <i>stubborn\n</i>monster of a vine off a\ntelephone pole, and wasn\u2019t paying much attention to his surrounds.\nWhen he finally managed to peel the sucker off, there were about\nthree eager D.O.D.C personnel who rushed forward to take it off his\nhands when he waved it vaguely in the air. One glance around showed\nhim that it was not just because they were fans of his \u2013 there were\npeople in D.O.D.C uniforms awkwardly loitering around every Avenger,\nand even his team members were standing around, hands empty, glancing\nat one another to figure out what was going on. It wasn\u2019t a\ndifficult mystery to solve, really: the rest of the line didn\u2019t\nhave much to do, because the cutting crew was cutting the vines up\ntoo slowly for the rest of them, giving a lack of things to peel or\ncarry. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re\ngoing as fast as we can,\u201d Quill said through gritted teeth when\ncautiously asked about it, and Clint could see the evidence in his\nstatement in the way they worked, throwing themselves and their\nweapons at every hard-to-cut-through, determined-to-advance,\nprone-to-fight-back-viciously vine. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>Or,\nin the way Quill and Rocket worked, in any case. Stark, on the other\nhand\u2026 Was he <i>seriously </i>just\nleaning against some half-crushed car, casually watching Quill and\nRocket work? Clint raised an eyebrow and threw a glance over at Steve\nwho, sure as anything, was doing the Eyebrow Thing at the side of\nStark\u2019s armoured head. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cSt\n\u2013 Iron Man,\u201d Steve started. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d\nStark didn\u2019t even turn and look at him. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>Steve\u2019s\nexpression grew cautious, and he took his time choosing his next\nwords, aware, just like everybody else, that there were still\ngrenades buried in the spaces between the members of the Avengers\nthat <i>hadn\u2019t </i>simply\ndisappeared when Thanos snapped his fingers. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re\nstill needing all hands on deck, here,\u201d Steve said in a measured\ntone. \u201cWe\u2019re still only about halfway, and it\u2019s already\nbeen\u2026\u201d He glanced at the nearest D.O.D.C crew member, who fumbled\nwith a watch. \u201cTwo and a half hours,\u201d he finished. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cAll\nthat backwards earth tec running out of juice?\u201d Rocket jibed,\nfiring four consecutive shots at a vine without looking, probably to\nprove he could. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cSuit\u2019s\nfine,\u201d Stark said, still not moving. There was a beat and then,\nquietly, even though the suit\u2019s speakers, he added, \u201cI think\u2026\n<i>I\u2019m </i>running out of\njuice.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>For\none moment, Clint was thrown by the soft confession. And then he\nremembered the whining, dramatic, grumpy-sarcastic man Stark had\nbecome those few times Clint had seen him sick, in the past, and he\nsighed. This cleanup operation was about to get a whole lot longer\nand a whole lot more irritating if Stark got the man flu on them.\nEspecially because the two people who could safely deal with Stark\nwhen he was being Especially Starkish were in the Facility\u2019s\nscience lab and in Geneva for an S.I. conference respectively. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cWell,\nif we hurry up, we\u2019ll be done sooner,\u201d Nat said, steadily, gaze\ndirect as though she could find some expression to read on Stark\u2019s\nmask. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>For\nanother moment, Stark didn\u2019t move. Then, without another word, he\npushed off from the car and got back to work. Everybody else followed\nsuit, and Clint was once again able to get lost in the monotony of\nthe job until about an hour later. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cDude,\nyou just took a break, come on,\u201d Quill complained, loud and\nirritated enough that Clint glanced over. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>Stark\nwas, once again, leaning against an object, this time with his head\nagainst the pole as well. The last time Clint had glanced up because\nof an over-saturation of tired but still eager D.O.D.C crew crowding\naround him, he\u2019d seen Rocket and Quill still at work while Stark\nsat on the side of the pavement, arms hanging between his knees and\nhead bent. For a moment, a niggle of worry flared in Clint; usually,\nin the suit and in front of a crowd, Stark put on a much better show\nthan this. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cStark,\u201d\nSteve said, managing to sound measured. \u201cWe\u2019re all tired, we\u2019re\nall sick of this\u2026 Let\u2019s just keep pulling our weight so we can go\nsooner than later.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>For\nabout a full minute, there was no answer from Stark. And then, in a\nvoice that sounded unusually mechanical, he said, \u201cI\u2026 really\ndon\u2019t\u2026 feel too good. Something\u2019s\u2026 I think something\u2019s\nwrong. I\u2026 it hurts all over.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\nwoulda worked better if you hadn\u2019t already been cleared by medical,\ndude,\u201d Quill shot back, still irritated.</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cThey\nsaid you were absolutely fine \u2013 barely any bruises or\nscrapes on you, even,\u201d\nSteve put in. \u201cHe told me, personally.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cThank\nyou for butting into personal medical information, Captain Obvious.\u201d\nThis time, the dead, mechanical tone had a snarl to it. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cCome\non, man,\u201d Sam said, sounding tired but still trying to be soothing.\n\u201cJust\u2026\u201d He waved a hand. \u201cIt sucks to be out here doing this,\nbut we\u2019re all here and at least you don\u2019t have alien-plant sap\nall over you that smells like your grandma\u2019s shoes after a hot\nday.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cThe\nD.O.D.C is here \u2013 this is their job,\u201d Stark started, finally\nlifting his head so he could turn it to where Steve stood. \u00a0\n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nour job, too. It always has been our job to \u2013\u201d Steve didn\u2019t get\nto finish. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cTo\nwhat, Rogers? To be <i>held accountable </i>for\nour actions? Is that what you were about to say?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>Bucky,\nprobably subconsciously, slidled closer to Steve. The D.O.D.C humans\nall looked about one second away from panicking. Natasha met Clint\u2019s\neyes, and Clint gave her a small nod of understanding. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay,\nlook. This is my last day here, and I want to go home to see in\nperson that my youngest son now enjoys eating the chicken\u2019s crap he\nfinds in the yard. That means getting this done and getting back to\nthe coast without another episode of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>.\nSo how about I take Stark and we go and clean up that small patch of\nvines on that one skyscraper they\u2019re colonising to give everybody a\ngood break? Stark, I\u2019ll even pretend you pulled your weight whether\nyou do so or not. How\u2019s that?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>Steve\nopened his mouth, then sighed, shut his eyes briefly, and nodded.\nStark jerked away from the lamppost, made his way over to Clint \u2013\nlike an angry teenager in combat boots; <i>stomp, stomp, stomp</i>\n\u2013 grabbed him without a word and lifted him once more into the air.\n\n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>This\ntime, he dropped Clint so suddenly and so hard that Clint couldn\u2019t\nkeep his footing and ended up half-sprawling, scraping his right side\nand his knees as he tried to stop his skid across the roof before he\nfell over the other side. The spike of surprise and pain ebbed and,\nin its place, anger reared. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay,\nseriously, what the ever-loving \u2013 \u201d Stark was on the roof, too.\nOn his hands and knees, with the faceplate peeled away, retching\nslightly onto the roof in front of him. The anger lowered to a\nsimmer, but didn\u2019t completely go away. \u201cStark?\u201d There was no\nanswer, so Clint got up and moved closer. \u201cHey\u2026\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cPiss\noff,\u201d Stark gasped at him. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>Clint\nscowled and flipped him the bird in response, even though Stark had\nhis eyes squeezed tightly shut. \u201cAsshole; I\u2019m trying to help.\nWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\u201cNothing\n\u2013 medical cleared me, remember?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>Clint\ngroaned out loud. \u201cYeah, Stark \u2013 sullen, smart-ass teenager\nresponses to these sorts of questions always work out well for\neverybody. Keep sticking your head further up your own ass.\u201d Once\nagain \u2013 too many times for that day, Clint suddenly realised \u2013\nStark remained silent, his eyes distant and slightly unfocused as he\nslowly rose to his feet. Clint couldn\u2019t miss the wince, even if it\ndid look like Stark tried to hide it. \u201cCome on, man. What does\nF.R.I.D.A.Y say, then?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>He\nread the answer in the tense silence and the way Stark would not look\nat him \u2013 his AI, it seemed, agreed with medical in their assessment\nthat Stark was completely fine. Clint frowned at Stark\u2019s face and\nposture and mulled things over for a beat or two before deciding that\nwhile he wasn\u2019t qualified to assess what was making Stark think he\nwas not fine when everybody was telling him otherwise, he was\nqualified to know Stark shouldn\u2019t be around helping to make New\nYork Tarzan unfriendly once more. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>His\nprevious offer to cover for Stark had been sarcastic and aimed at\nstopping a stupid intra-team bickering session. This time, the offer\nwas crafted in complete sincerity and the desire to offer an olive\nbranch and get Stark the break he needed to figure out what was going\non with him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just skip out on the rest of this?\nTag somebody else in to do your part for you, instead.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>Even\nas the words left his mouth, Clint realised his fatal error in the\nway he\u2019d phrased things. He immediately tried to backtrack and take\naway the implications he hadn\u2019t meant to make, but Stark\u2019s head\nsnapped towards him and there was suddenly cold ice in his expression\nand in his voice when he told Clint where to go and stick it. Before\nClint could get out more than <i>I didn\u2019t mean</i>,\nStark\u2019s faceplate was once again covering his face, and he\u2019d\nlaunched himself into the air so he could start firing at the vines\nthey were supposed to be taking down. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>Clint\nthrew up his hands in disgust, irritated at both Stark and himself,\nand let the man go. <br/></p><hr><p>\nThe\nboots of the Iron Man armour hit the floor of Tony\u2019s lab and,\ndespite the armour still encasing him, Tony immediately stumbled into\na wall and then collapsed in an undignified heap on the floor. For a\nlong moment, he could hear nothing except his own harsh, uneven\nbreathing and the ringing empty fullness of his head, throbbing\naround in meaningless circles. The only thing that stood out in the\nfog and the confusion was the pain that radiated through his entire\nbody. He\u2019d felt bone-deep agony, before, and this somehow went even\n<i>deeper</i>, to an\nintensity that his mind simply could not wrap itself around. It felt\nlike all the non-hurting a body usually did by default was being\n<i>pulled </i>out of him inch\nby agonising inch; a deep <i>drag </i>he\ncould subconsciously feel but not pinpoint or explain, making his\nbones and veins and very atoms howl in agony every time the tide\ninside of him went out and pulled more of the un-pain and energy out\nof him, leaving him with nothing but the opposite of un-pain\n<i>everywhere</i> in streaks\nof fire. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201c-\nhave them come to the Facility at once.\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>F.R.I.D.A.Y\u2019s\nvoice faded in from some distant universe, and he spoke his first\nthought out loud. \u201cThough\u2019 I muted\u2026you.\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cIn\nthe suit, Boss, you did. Not in the Facility.\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Any\nother time he would have been proud of her for managing to interpret\nhis slurred words, or would have been nostalgically bittersweet by\nthe way she was starting to pick up inflection in her words. JARVIS\nhad taken longer to do that, but once he\u2019d gotten the hang of it\u2026\nNobody could do exasperatedly-worried like JARVIS could. But this\ntime, those observations were mere flickers on a mental screen\nusually buzzing with so many different things at once, now reduced to\nabsolute Blue Screen meltdown. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWh\u2019er\nyou saying?\u201d He\u2019d missed the first part of her statement, and\nthought it could be important. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nin the process of scanning you using my Facility capabilities, and\nthen I\u2019m sending the data to medical to \u2013 \u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cOverride,\u201d\nhe said, at once, still aware enough to know to do that. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cBoss,\nyour temperature is currently 103.8 and showing no signs of slowing\ndown -\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThis\u2019s\nwhy I\u2019uted you in\u2019th suit,\u201d Tony reminded her, trying to make\nhis tone one of warning while he shut his eyes, rolled his forehead\nto the wall and unsuccessfully tried to swallow a low whine of pain. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cAnd\nI still cannot detect the reason for it,\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y finished, not\nat all cowed. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201c\u2019zactly,\nFri,\u201d Tony panted, fingers unknowingly scrabbling against the wall\nand floor as he sought a purchase he could not grasp in the waves of\npain. \u201cMedical\u2026 checked. You\u2026 checked. Nothing\u2026 wron-\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>He\nwas too far awash in the pain to register that he was making loud,\nunrestrained howl-moans of pain, or that he was near-writhing against\nthe wall. Instinctively, he curled in on himself, clutching as hard\nas he could. And, miraculously, his touch helped cut off the pain. As\nthe after-effects receded, he dimly heard F.R.I.D.A.Y talking to him\nagain. Probably the same thing she\u2019d been warning him about for\nhours: his body was trying to fight off some illness that didn\u2019t\nexist. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Hell,\nhe was so tired. And, apparently, not breathing right, he realised a\nfuzzy moment or several later, rectifying this by taking in a deep\nbreath that sounded like a death rattle. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cBoss,\n<i>please</i>.\u201d He\u2019d\nnever heard his AI beg before. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cNot\u2026\nwasting people\u2019s\u2026 time\u2026 with\u2026 nothing\u2026\u201d Tony ground out\nat her, gripping himself tighter as an instinctive experiment, and\nlaughing slightly breathlessly when the hard pressure on his limbs\nnumbed the pain. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThis\nis <i>not </i>nothing,\u201d\nF.R.I.D.A.Y insisted, and then continued with words Tony didn\u2019t\nbother to listen to because his exhausted, burning, pain-overided\nmind was trying to latch on to the blessed relief he\u2019d just\naccidentally discovered. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Pressure\nstopped the pain. He could almost stand to exist in his skin, again,\nnow that he was gripping himself as hard as he could. But\u2026 <i>but</i>.\nHis grip was fever-weak. And he could only put pressure on certain\npoints. The energy-sapping pulls of agony still happened in the parts\nof his body he was currently unable to hug, and he could feel his\nability to keep a tight hold on himself slipping. He was shaking too\nhard to keep it up for long. He needed something that would put\npressure <i>everywhere</i>.\nHe needed something <i>heavy</i>\n\u2013 stronger than he could grip. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Couch.\nThere was a couch in his lab. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Getting\nto it would mean he\u2019d have to uncurl himself. That would mean\nagony. And\u2026 he didn\u2019t know if he could reach it. F.R.I.D.A.Y\ncontrolling the armour had been the only thing that had gotten him in\nthe air after Steve called the end of cleanup, let alone back to the\nFacility and safely through the entry hatch into his lab. And\u2026 oh.\nThe armour was currently not around him, any more. When had it\nreceded? Had he done that? \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Wave\nof agony to get him back on track. Couch. Right. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Couldn\u2019t\nget there. Wasn\u2019t strong enough. Had to get the couch to him. How?\nWho could he possibly call? The rest of the team was probably still\non their way over on the Quinjet. And they all knew nothing was wrong\nwith him. Couldn\u2019t call Bruce, either. Bruce was a doctor. Ish.\nHe\u2019d know there was nothing wrong with Tony, too, and his gentle\nindulging Tony sarcastically would drive Tony up the wall when it was\nbeing done while the agony -</p><p><br/></p><p>-hit\nin a wave like it just did. Couch. He had to get the couch over to\nhim. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Armour.\nThe armour was strong enough to do so. He had an old model in the lab\nfor (security, always security, just in case) aesthetic nostalgia.\nF.R.I.D.A.Y could pilot it. Could use it to drop the couch on him. He\nthought he ordered her to do so, but there was silence in the lab for\nso long that he started to think he\u2019d only <i>thought </i>of\ntelling her and hadn\u2019t actually made the words come out. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>And\nthen, slowly, \u201cI\u2019m choosing to ignore that request, Boss, because\nit measures in the realm of delirium and conflicts with my primary\nobjective.\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y\u2026\njust\u2026 get the armour\u2026\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cBoss,\nI cannot -\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cOverride\u2026\ncode\u2026\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cBoss,\nI implore you not to -\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cOverride\u2026\ncode\u2026\u201d <br/></p><hr><p>\n\u201cHey, Bruce?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\nBruce looked up curiously from whatever he was reading at Clint\u2019s\nvoice. \u00a0\u201cYou guys are back,\u201d he said, sounding relieved. \u201cThat\nwas a long one.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\n\u201cCleanup sucked,\u201d Clint said, succinctly. \u201cMore on the news at\neight.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\nBruce grinned. \u201cAlready got all the cool footage from Twitter,\u201d\nhe said, sounding a little smug. Then he took off his glasses and\nsaid, more seriously, \u201cWhat can I help you with?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\n\u201cGot a scrape I think is full of stuff that I can\u2019t reach myself\nthat I got after medical had already checked us and left,\u201d Clint\nsaid evenly, hoping Bruce wouldn\u2019t ask how he got it so he didn\u2019t\nhave to choose whether to lie or to rat out Stark to one of his\nclosest friends and put Banner in the middle. Again. \u201cCould use\nsome help.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\nBruce winced in sympathy and stood immediately, gesturing Clint\ntoward the small but efficient medbay. \u201cSure, of course.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\nBut when they neared the room, there was a blinking light on one of\nthe walls that made Clint frown. \u201cHey, isn\u2019t that an alert from\nF.R.I.D.A.Y?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\nStark hadn\u2019t put her all over the old compound as he had in the\ntower, but she was inserted in certain key rooms, of which the medbay\nwas one. The light meant she\u2019d tried to reach somebody, hadn\u2019t\nfound them, and had left a message. Bruce picked up the pace\nsomewhat, opened the door, and called the AI\u2019s name in question. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\n\u201cDoctor Banner, your presence is needed in Mr Stark\u2019s lab\nimmediately,\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y rattled, so fast the words were nearly\nonly a blur of sound. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\nFor a moment, it threw both men. And then Bruce was whirling on his\nheel and half jogging to Stark\u2019s lab and Clint was following,\ndespite the pace pulling on his fresh scrapes and bruises, because\nsomething in his gut was telling him that something was very, very\nwrong. Bruce keyed in his access code to the lab, hauled open the\ndoor, and immediately breathed something in a language Clint didn\u2019t\nunderstand. He got the gist, though, and a moment later he added an\nEnglish equivalent when he saw Stark starfished on the ground with a\nlarge sofa pinning everything from his neck down. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\n\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y, what happened?\u201d Bruce asked as they both rushed to\nStark\u2019s side and, without needing to ask the other for assistance,\nhauled the sofa off of him. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\n\u201cBoss used an override code to make me pilot the old armour to drop\nthe couch on him,\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y said, her voice flatter and more\nmechanical than Clint had ever heard it. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\n\u201cWhat? Why the <i>hell </i>did he do that?\u201d Clint asked,\nincredulously staring at the seemingly unconscious genius while Bruce\nknelt at his side and started poking and prodding at him. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\n\u201cBoss wasn\u2019t\u2026 he wasn\u2019t being very coherent at the time, but\nhe said something about the pressure helping to ease the pain.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\n\u201cWhat \u2013 \u201d Clint started, but Bruce beat him to a question, his\nvoice authoritative and clipped. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\n\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y, what\u2019s his temp?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\n\u201cCurrently 104.3, Doctor Banner.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\n\u201cCause?\u201d Bruce fired out as Clint swore again, a swoop of concern\nand deep, aching guilt beginning to turn his stomach. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\n\u201cNone found.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\nBruce jerked a little in shock, his hands all over Stark\u2019s neck and\nforehead. \u201cWhat do you mean, there\u2019s no cause?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\n\u201cMedical scans at the scene of the battle, and subsequent scans\ndone by the suit and the equipment present in this room have revealed\nthat there is no cause for Mr Stark to have a fever. There is no sign\nof any pathogens or infections, and the only other physical wounds\nare minor bruising and abrasions and the three broken ribs that\noccurred due to the impact of the sofa.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\nClint realised, sort of numbly, that F.R.I.D.A.Y\u2019s suddenly\nmonotonous speech pattern sounded awfully like some S.H.E.I.L.D\nagents he knew when they were both panicked and trying not to be, and\novercome with guilt. He pushed the thought away and focused on Bruce\nand a pale, unresponsive, sweaty Stark. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\n\u201cWe <i>need </i>to stop this fever, but I can\u2019t risk giving him\nanything if we don\u2019t know what this <i>is</i>,\u201d Bruce muttered,\nsounding frustrated. \u201cAnd this place <i>doesn\u2019t have baths</i>.\u201d\n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\n\u201cThere\u2019s the water fixture out back?\u201d Clint put in, helpfully. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\nBruce nodded sharply, once. \u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y, is anybody close to one\nof your speakers?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\n\u201cNot at present, Doctor, no.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\n\u201cClint, text somebody, then. Tell them to pour boiling water into\nthe fountain \u2013 I need it lukewarm. And <i>fast</i>. Then help me\nlift him.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\nClint did as Bruce asked without a word, fingers flying over a text\nto Nat, using codewords so she knew he was being <i>serious</i>.\nBruce continued to converse with F.R.I.D.A.Y over symptoms and\nhappenings, but the story remained the same: Tony\u2019s body was frying\nitself, and nobody knew why. Helpfully, Clint\u2019s brain chose to\nremind him of all the early warning signs from earlier that day: how\nStark had been visibly flagging. How Stark had <i>told </i>them\nsomething was wrong. How he\u2019d seen Stark on his hands and knees,\nretching and clearly not okay, and hadn\u2019t told anybody because\nStark was a damn big idiot, and, apparently, Clint was one, too. He\u2019d\nmessed up, he knew. And big time. Never <i>mind </i>that medical had\ncleared him \u2013 Clint should have known better. And <i>done </i>better.\n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\nBruce grabbed Tony\u2019s torso, and Clint grabbed his legs, and\ntogether they began the arduous task of hauling Stark to the back\nentrance of the Facility, where a gaudy water fixture that was\napparently an in-joke between Rhodes and Stark stood. Stark didn\u2019t\nso much as twitch once, and the lack of animation in the man kept the\ngrim reality so fresh in Clint\u2019s mind that he couldn\u2019t quite\nfathom, for a moment, why the rest of the remaining team were all\ngathered around the fountain waiting for him with various amused\nexpressions on their faces. Even Wanda was there, dragged away from\nVision\u2019s cradle-side and standing, cross-armed and bemused beside\nwhere Steve and Bucky both held a giant hot water urn each. Only\nNatasha didn\u2019t look entirely convinced that the world\u2019s biggest\njoke was about to unfold. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\n\u201cOh, man, are we throwing a sleeping Stark in the -\u201d Sam started,\nvoice amused. And then he must have <i>really </i>caught sight of\nStark, because his tone changed completely. \u201cOh, <i>shit</i>.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\nClint and Bruce didn\u2019t bother to acknowledge him or any of the\nother demands to know what was going on as people either caught sight\nof Stark or got caught up in the confusion about why people\u2019s faces\nand reactions were suddenly saying that things weren\u2019t funny, any\nmore. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\n\u201cHow warm is the water?\u201d Bruce panted as he and Clint approached\nthe fountain. \u201cGuys!\u201d he snapped, when nobody answered fast\nenough. \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\n\u201cLukewarm, like Clint asked,\u201d Steve said, and Sam hurried forward\nto help Bruce and Clint lift Stark into the fountain water. \u201cWhat\u2019s\ngoing on? What happened?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\nClint relinquished his hold on Stark\u2019s legs and stepped away with\nSam before he glanced back at the concerned, and slightly confounded,\nlooking Rogers. \u201cWe don\u2019t know. F.R.I.D.A.Y has been scanning\nhim, and she can\u2019t find anything wrong. But he\u2019s got a fever of\n104, and we have to get it down, and Bruce says we can\u2019t use\nmedication safely until we know what\u2019s got him feverish and why\nneither medical nor F.R.I.D.A.Y can pick it up.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br/></p><p>\nBruce was holding Stark up against the side of the fountain with one\narm, awkwardly, and cupping water over his forehead with the other,\nmethodologically trying to get the water to cool him off. And it\nseemed to be working \u2013 for the first time since Clint had seen him\nthat afternoon, Stark stirred and let out a little wordless noise,\nobviously coming to. And then Banner trickled another handful of\nwater over his forehead, and the water ran over Stark\u2019s face, and\nthe man completely <i>flipped, </i>going from unconscious to wildly\nfighting Bruce in less time than it took Clint to take two full\nbreaths. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cTony!\nTonyTonyTonyTony \u2013 Hey! Hey! <i>Hey</i>!\nLook at me! <i>Look </i>at\nme!\u201d Stark almost managed to twist out of Banner\u2019s hold, but that\nonly plunged him further into the water, which made him thrash\nwilder. Several people took steps forward, instinctively trying to\nhelp but not quite knowing how. \u201cLook at me!\u201d Bruce grabbed him\ntight, again, and hauled him to the wall and then grabbed Stark\u2019s\nchin, forcing the man\u2019s gaze to his. \u201c<i>Look at me</i>.\nYou\u2019re fine. You\u2019re okay. I\u2019m sorry, Tony, I\u2019m sorry. But\nyou\u2019re burning up. And we need to get your temperature down, okay?\nSo you need to stay in the water.\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cBruce\u2026\n<i>no</i>\u2026 <i>No</i>,\nI -\u201d Stark choked and tried, once again, to get<i> </i>free.\n\n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nsorry,\u201d Bruce repeated, and he sounded it, even though he was also\nvery obviously unrelenting. \u201cI\u2019m sorry; I know. I know. But you\nneed to. I won\u2019t put any more on your head, okay? I won\u2019t. But I\nneed you to stay in the water, Tony. Okay? Please? For me?\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>The\nnoise Stark made was unnameable. \u201cNo\u2026no more\u2026\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cNo\nmore on your head \u2013 I promise. But then you gotta stay, okay?\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Stark\ndidn\u2019t reply, simply slumped, suddenly boneless, leaving Bruce to\nclumsily catch him. And Clint hadn\u2019t done all he could have \u2013\nshould have \u2013 before, but he\u2019d learned a long time ago that a\nman\u2019s current actions and future actions said a lot more than his\npast ones. So he climbed, in jeans but thankfully barefoot, into the\nfountain and plopped down behind Stark and wordlessly pulled him\nagainst his side, holding him above the water so Bruce could have\nboth hands free. Stark was out of it, again; adrenalin all burned\nthrough. Clint wished for the snarky or lewd comments that would\nordinarily have followed his attempts to \u2018cuddle\u2019 Stark in any\nway. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cSomebody\nget me Strange,\u201d Bruce called over his shoulder, not bothering to\ncheck who followed his order as he checked Stark\u2019s vitals and then\nbegan pouring water on the parts of Stark, except his face and head,\nthat protruded out the water. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cDoctor,\u201d\nWanda said, quietly, and held up the scarf she\u2019d been wearing to\nBruce. He blinked at it for a moment. \u201cA\u2026 a\u2026\u201d She gave up on\nthe word she did not know. \u201cWet it. For his forehead.\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThanks,\nWanda,\u201d Bruce said, his voice becoming the closest to its usual\ngentle lilt for the first time since they\u2019d found Stark in his lab.\n\n</p><p><br/></p><p>Bruce\ndipped, wrung and folded the scarf and then placed it on Stark\u2019s\nforehead. The man twitched a little in response, but didn\u2019t\notherwise react, once again seemingly gone to the world. And then\nBruce sat back on his haunches and scrubbed his hands over his face,\nand Clint watched Stark\u2019s chest rise and fall and continued to\npretend he wasn\u2019t hyper-aware of all the people hovering silently\naround and watching, at a loss of anything to do but also not willing\nto let Stark out of their sight. Murmuring started up, but before the\nspeakers could decide to make themselves better heard the usual\nspitting fire oval of a portal appeared just before the door and\nStrange stepped through. He took in the scene and raised one eyebrow\nat the sight of the three in the fountain, looking more bemused than\nworried. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Until\nBruce started rattling off Stark\u2019s medical stats to him \u2013 then\nStrange\u2019s face morphed to one of wide-eyed comprehension before he\nwas leaping forward, ripping off his dishwashing-yellow\ngloves and shoving his fingers on Stark\u2019s neck, demanding to know\nwhat happened. The response he got from Steve did not please him at\nall. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cOh,\nso <i>something </i>was\nattacking the city, and <i>something </i>happened\nbetween then and Stark coming home and now <i>something </i>is\nwrong. How detailed, Rogers,\u201d\nhe snapped, gently hip-checking a hovering Bruce out of his way. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cMedical\nchecked him out post-battle and they cleared him,\u201d Steve said, a\ntouch defensively. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWonderful\n\u2013 they studied all those years to become <i>professional\n</i>idiots,\u201d Strange fired back\nwithout missing a beat, giving Clint his first real-life encounter\nwith the infamous surgeon he\u2019d heard so much about before the man\nhad taken up magic. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHis\nAI has been routinely scanning him since the battle and has found\nnothing to explain his rising fever,\u201d Bruce put in, his hands\nnervously spinning his glasses around and around. \u201cMedically, he\u2019s\nsound. He <i>should </i>be\nsound.\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWhat\nmagical interferences does his AI scan for?\u201d Strange asked, scarred\nhands finally leaving Stark to hover in a strange formation above the\nman\u2019s chest. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d\nBruce blinked, looked to Clint bewilderedly, and then swung his gaze\nto the rest of the team, looking for answers Clint knew none of them\nhad. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 think she scans\u2026 for magic\u2026\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cBut\nthis being you were fighting earlier was magic? And used magical\nattacks?\u201d Strange said in a tone full of barely-restrained\npatronisation. Bruce looked to Steve, who murmured a slightly abashed\naffirmative. \u201cWell, then, I\u2019m thinking the cause of the\nmysterious non-medical fever <i>may </i>be\n<i>magic</i>, then.\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>If\nStrange was expecting a reply of some sort, he didn\u2019t show it, but\nsimply started moving his fingers in odd patterns around Stark\u2019s\nbody, muttering things too soft for Clint to hear. Everybody else was\ntensely silent, hovering as close as they dared and watching the\nproceedings like hawks. They needn\u2019t have looked quite so closely \u2013\nnobody could have missed the sudden yellow-green flare that appeared\nfrom Stark\u2019s thigh, right where, Clint was guessing, the Vine\nMaster had slammed an attack into Stark earlier. Strange\u2019s face,\nwhen he stopped his magic and straightened, was grim. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t know if I can combat this magic without the caster. I\u2019m\ngoing to send word to Wong to try, but our best course of action is\nto make the guy who did this help us take it back. Does anybody here\nknow where he\u2019s being held?\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\ncan find out,\u201d Natasha said, at once, and turned on her heel\nwithout waiting for a response. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Strange\nnodded after her. \u201cWhat do we do in the meantime?\u201d Bruce asked\nurgently. \u201cSurely there\u2019s <i>something</i>?\u201d\n\n</p><p><br/></p><p>Strange\ntipped his head. \u201cYou can give him whatever fever reducers and\nlow-dose painkillers you have in stock to try and combat the fever.\nOther than that\u2026\u201d Bruce\u2019s jaw worked, and Strange sighed and\nsoftened, a little. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Doctor Banner, but this magic\nis\u2026 It\u2019s a drain. It\u2019s pulling energy out of him in a way that\nhis body is interpreting as an invading pathogen and extreme pain at\nthe same time. There\u2019s no real cause to fight, in this case, so\nwe\u2019ll have to try and tackle the symptoms for now; try to lesson\nthem and make him as comfortable as possible.\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Bruce\nopened his mouth, looking frustrated, then simply sighed, nodded and\nmuttered about going to find some medication, then. Strange knelt\nbeside the fountain and reached for Stark again, checking his pulse.\nHis frown deepened and, dropping his hand, he began to massage\nStark\u2019s chest. Clint let go of his hold, shifting back so that\nStrange had more access, balancing Stark precariously about him. It\nwasn\u2019t three minutes later before Stark began to twitch, his face\nno longer slack but scrunched in discomfort, his exhales starting to\nsound like whines. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re\nyou doing, dude?\u201d Quill demanded. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Strange\nwas frowning even deeper. \u201cThis isn\u2019t me,\u201d he muttered, mostly\ndistracted. \u201cThis <i>should </i>be\nhis reaction; I assumed he was simply too deeply unconscious to\nshow\u2026\u201d He puzzled for another moment, hands hovering over Stark\u2019s\nchest, and even though he wasn\u2019t touching him, Stark began to\nwrithe harder, breaths beginning to turn to pants. And then Strange\u2019s\nexpression cleared. \u201cHow did you find him?\u201d he demanded of Clint.\n\n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cUh\u2026\npassed out? On his lab floor. Under a sofa \u2013 he made his AI drop\nhis sofa on him.\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHe\n<i>what</i>?\u201d Sam\nexclaimed. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>But\nStrange smiled, slightly. \u201cGate control theory,\u201d he said, just as\nBruce reappeared. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Oh</i>,\u201d\nBruce exclaimed, just as Clint demanded, \u201c<i>What?</i>\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThe\ngate control theory of pain,\u201d Strange said, beginning to massage\nagain, but this time doing so all over Stark\u2019s torso. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cIf\nyou\u2026 uh\u2026 flood the brain with non-painful input, it \u2018closes\u2019\nthe \u2018pain gates\u2019 in the brain,\u201d Bruce picked up from Strange.\n\u201cSo the more you force yourself to feel something else, the less\nyour brain processes and informs you about the pain.\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHence\ndropping a sofa on yourself \u2013 that\u2019s input to the nth degree,\u201d\nStrange said, and then muttered, \u201cDamn, it, Stark, you idiot,\u201d\nunder his breath. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cSo\nthat means\u2026?\u201d Rocket said, his voice still blank from\ncomprehension. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThat\nmeans, Barton, that you\u2019d better start holding him very tightly\nonce again,\u201d Strange said, and Clint followed his orders at once.\n\u201cKeep as much input as you can going into him at all times; it will\ndefinitely help.\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cStrange.\nI have the location. Let\u2019s go.\u201d At the sorcerer\u2019s look she put\non a smirk that didn\u2019t reach her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m coming with to\u2026\n<i>assist</i>\u2026 in the\ninformation extraction.\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Strange\nsnorted, rose to his feet and then, just before he reached Natasha he\nturned back somewhat to Bruce. \u201cBanner\u2026 I\u2019d add some\nnitroglycerin to the cocktail you\u2019re going to give him.\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Bruce\u2019s\nface blanched. \u201cBad?\u201d he said, sounding resigned. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cNot\nyet, but I think it\u2019s going to go there.\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cGet\nthe counteraction quickly, then,\u201d Banner almost-demanded, and\nStrange nodded before opening a portal for him and Natasha to walk\nthrough.</p><p><br/></p><p>Bruce\nscrubbed at his face, again, for a moment, and then settled beside\nStark and started administering medication. Clint held on while Stark\ngot the shots, and for ages afterwards, until his muscles were\nstarting to strain from the continuous pressure. Bruce took Stark\u2019s\ntemperature with a digital thermometer and then declared they could\ntake him inside. Steve started forward, hesitantly, wordlessly\noffering his strength, but before Bruce could say anything tendrils\nof red wrapped themselves coyly around Stark\u2019s form and lifted him\nright out of Clint\u2019s arms. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWhere\nare we taking him?\u201d Wanda asked, calmly, her eyes glowing red and\nher hold on Stark steady. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>They\ntook him to the medbay, small as it was, because F.R.I.D.A.Y was\nintegrated into the room and because having sensors on Stark made\nthem feel better, even though they couldn\u2019t help much. Before Wanda\nplaced Stark on the bed, Bruce kicked off his shoes and lay down\nfirst, telling her to put Stark on top of him so he could wrap\nhimself around Stark as best he could. Steve excused himself in a\nmutter to go and call Pepper \u2013 she didn\u2019t know anything about\nthis, yet, and he thought she had the right to. Sam dragged a chair\nto the foot of the bed and began massaging Stark\u2019s feet and\nwet-underarmour-clad legs with practised hands, while Banner let\nhimself drop his face against Stark\u2019s hair, something in his face\n<i>daring </i>anybody to say\nanything. Even Rocket didn\u2019t make a comment, choosing instead to\nslink away and leave Bruce, Stark and Sam in peace. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>He\ncame back, though \u2013 all of the team cycled through the room, even\nthough most did not attempt to help massage Stark but simply talked,\nquietly, to Bruce or amongst themselves or sat silently in the\ncorner, keeping watch over something they could not see. Clint took\nover from Bruce when the other man had to relieve himself and also do\ndoctor-y things on Stark, again, and Clint saw him frowning at the\ntablet screen in his hand when he quietly asked F.R.I.D.A.Y for an\nEKG. Unease writhed in Clint\u2019s gut, and, when Bruce was out the\nroom for a moment, he decided to try and emulate the massaging he\u2019d\nseen Strange do on Stark\u2019s chest. It had looked simple enough. And\nit was supposedly to help, right?<br/><br/></p><p>About\nthree minutes in, Stark jerked almost-violently in his arms. \u201c<i>Don\u2019t</i>.\u201d\nClint supposed the word was supposed to be a snarl instead of the\nbreathless half-moan. \u201c\u2019n\u2019t touch.\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cOkay,\nokay.\u201d Clint raised both hands in surrender, even though Stark\nhadn\u2019t actually managed to open his eyes. \u201cJeesh, <i>sorry</i>.\u201d\nStark grunted, softly. And then, a few beats later, Clint added\nanother <i>sorry</i> for\neverything since the accords that they hadn\u2019t spoken about. Stark\ndidn\u2019t reply to that, but he did suddenly move so that he was more\nin Clint\u2019s embrace, face almost in the crook of his neck, and Clint\nthought, not for the first time, that the beginning of understanding\nand mending looked flipping <i>weird </i>every\ntime he came into contact with it. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Despite\nwhatever Banner was trying, and despite the fact that Quill had also\ntried his hand at massaging, looking unsure and awkward and red-eared\nbut also determined, Stark continued to deteriorate. His fever\ncontinued to climb slowly but surely, no matter what they did, and by\nthe time evening had turned properly to night he was wheezing rather\nthan breathing, twitching and moaning no matter how hard Bruce held\nonto him from behind or how frantically people massaged. Nat wasn\u2019t\nanswering Clint\u2019s messages, meaning she had nothing to report, and\neverybody was on edge, even Bucky and Steve who had yet to hover\ncloser than just outside the doorway of the medical room. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Clint\nhad just started to wish something, <i>anything</i>,\nwould come and break the silent, brooding, watching tension, when his\nwish was granted in the worst possible way. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHey,\nguys, what\u2019s going on? I couldn\u2019t find <i>anybody </i>in\nthis place and F.R.I.D.A.Y said you were all\u2026\u201d Everybody\nswivelled to face Parker, whose cheery expression slipped somewhat at\nthe sight of the wall of stony Avengers. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHey,\nkid, don\u2019t you have, like, exams?\u201d Sam said, trying to casually\nblock Peter\u2019s view of the medbay. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYeah,\nbut it\u2019s F.R.I.D.A.Y, so I have all weekend, and Mr Stark said\nI\u2026\u201d Peter trailed off. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What\u2019s wrong?\nWhose breathing is all\u2026?\u201d His face turned pale. \u201cMr Stark?\u201d\nhe called. \u201cMr Stark, are you here?\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cKid,\u201d\nSteve started, gently warning, but Parker\u2019s face turned determined\nand he darted and twisted his way into the room. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWhat\n<i>happened</i>?\u201d he\nyelped, catching sight of Stark, his eyes huge as they turned on\nBruce. \u201cWhat\u2019s <i>wrong</i>?\u201d\n\n</p><p><br/></p><p>Bruce\nfilled him in as gently as he could \u2013 everything from the call to\nassemble (<i>\u201cYou should have called me, too! I could have\nhelped!\u201d</i>) to Strange figuring\nout the mysterious non-illness that was currently attacking Stark.\nBanner glossed over how much pain Strange had said Stark was in,\nsimply alluding to the fact that the magic was making Stark\nuncomfortable and that the other input was helping with that. Or had\nbeen, Clint added, silently. It looked like their miraculous\ntemporary cure was losing its effectiveness. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Clint\u2019s\ngrim thoughts proved to be right when Stark\u2019s wheezing turned to\nlow whines of pain, his fingers twitching compulsively even as Bruce\ntried to calm him and asked Sam to administer another shot of pain\nmedication through the IV line. Stark was sweating profusely yet\nagain, and Banner\u2019s face was full of lines of worry. Parker\u2019s\nrise from the end of Stark\u2019s bed was sudden enough that every eye\nin the room turned to him automatically. Ignoring their gazes, but\nturning almost as red as the suit he still wore under his unzipped\nhoodie, Peter crawled carefully onto the bed and then slowly lowered\nhimself on top of Stark before wrapping his arms and legs over him.\nBruce and he had to turn their faces to opposite sides to avoid\nbumping noses \u2013 or something more embarrassing \u2013 but neither of\nthem said a word about it. And, miraculously, neither did anybody\nelse. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThis\nisn\u2019t working,\u201d Peter said into the silence, almost an hour\nlater. He sounded almost <i>angry</i>.\n\u201cDoctor Banner\u2026 his heartbeat.. I\u2026\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\nknow, kid, I know,\u201d Bruce said, heavily. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s\u2026\nthere\u2019s gotta be <i>something</i>.\nI mean\u2026 I mean surely\u2026 F.R.I.D.A.Y, scan him. Search\u2026 search\nother ways to\u2026 to help with pain. We have to\u2026\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Bruce\nlet go of Stark with one hand and placed it on Peter\u2019s back. His\nface was still turned away from Clint\u2019s corner of the room, so he\nsaw no expression. But there was no missing the stiffness of Parker\u2019s\nspine. How close was it to midnight? He was supposed to leave the\nnext day, early in the morning. Supposed to go back to his wife and\nkids. But Clint hadn\u2019t been able to leave the <i>room </i>for\nhours. If Stark was still trapped in medical agony when his ride\ncame\u2026 Clint was almost positive he knew that he\u2019d be staying put.\n\n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cDoctor\nStrange and Agent Romanov have returned,\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y blurted, and\nClint felt his heart lurch in hope. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Those\noutside the doorway and just within it all flattened themselves\nagainst the walls \u2013 and there was something you didn\u2019t see every\nday; Captain America and the White Wolf trying to make themselves\nsmall \u2013 and Strange strode in, magic already on his fingers. But\ninstead of going straight to Stark he began drawing a pattern on the\nfloor. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cIs\nhe seriously doing a pentagram?\u201d Wanda asked, shocked into\nincredulity. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d\nStrange said, simply, while Peter finally gave in to curiosity and\ntwisted to look, doing an awkward pretzel on top of Stark to manage\nit. \u201cSame principle, though. Sort of.\u201d Design complete, he turned\nto the Stark-sandwich on the bed. \u201cWe have to get him inside this.\nBut he has to be concious, and he has to be standing alone.\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Standing</i>?\u201d\nRocket barked. \u201cDude, I don\u2019t know how hard your cloak banged you\ninto a building, but \u2013 \u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHe\nhas to be able to make a line with his body, or this won\u2019t work,\u201d\nthe sorcerer snapped back, making only a little bit of sense. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>He\nleft his magic circle and made it to Stark\u2019s bedside, making Peter\nwithdraw and Bruce look politely away as he began trying to wake the\nman. When traditional methods didn\u2019t work, he sighed and began\nmassaging at Stark\u2019s chest. Clint winced a little, remembering the\ngenius\u2019 reaction to the touch earlier. But even that didn\u2019t seem\nto be rousing the man and Clint\u2019s worry began to sink deeper. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t\nthat\u2026 I mean\u2026 doesn\u2019t it hurt?\u201d It was only because Clint was\nso close that he heard Parker\u2019s very soft question. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cNo,\nactually, this is helping regulate his heartbeat a little.\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cNo\u2026\nI\u2026 uh\u2026 I mean\u2026 <i>you</i>.\nIsn\u2019t it\u2026?\u201d Parker went red, eyes sliding very obviously away\nfrom Strange\u2019s scarred hands. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Strange\nlet out an almost-laugh. \u201cLike hell,\u201d he admitted, voice even\nquieter than Parker\u2019s. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Clint\nsaw Parker lick his lips. \u201cThen\u2026 could you\u2026 teach me? So I can,\ninstead?\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>It\nwas one of the most bizarre sights Clint had ever witnessed \u2013 the\ncounterpart of the Hulk acting as a bottom body pillow to an\nunconscious, sweaty, wheezing Stark while the Sorcerer Supreme talked\nSpider-Man, who was still mostly lying <i>on </i>Stark,\nthrough massaging the genius\u2019 chest correctly. When Peter got the\nhang of it, Strange asked Bruce where he kept a certain drug and then\ncarefully fed it into the IV line. Stark started stirring not long\nafter that. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cPete?\u201d\nhe whispered, sounding confused. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHi,\nMr Stark.\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Clint\nwanted, suddenly, to tell Parker to stop touching Stark\u2019s chest. He\ndidn\u2019t want to have to see the hurt he <i>knew </i>would\nflash all through the kid when Stark reacted violently to Parker\u2019s\nmassaging. But Stark\u2019s eyes roved over Parker, and what his hands\nwere doing, and then they rolled drunkenly, not quite tracking, to\nStrange without so much as an increase in his breathing. The noise he\nlet out was nowhere near any language Clint had ever heard, but\nStrange seemed to half-understand enough to reply. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWe\nknow how to make it stop. We just have to get you into that circle,\nthere.\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Strange\nmotioned Peter to get off, and the kid reluctantly agreed, slipping\nright to the end of the bed until Strange and Bruce started helping\nStark into a seated position \u2013 then he shimmied forward, again, and\npulled one of Stark\u2019s arms over his shoulders while Bruce\ndisconnected the IV line. Single-handedly, Parker managed to heave \nStark off the bed and keep him on his feet, a sight that would have\nbeen comical under any other circumstance. Banner took Stark\u2019s\nother side and they began carrying Stark \u2013 there was no other word\nfor it; the man\u2019s feet weren\u2019t even lifting, his head was lolling\nonto Parker\u2019s shoulder, his entire body slumped bonelessly \u2013 to\nthe magical mark on the floor Strange stood in front of. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cStark\u2026\nit will only take a moment, but you need to be standing for it.\u201d\nStark didn\u2019t react. \u201cTony. <i>Tony</i>.\u201d\n\n</p><p><br/></p><p>Stark\nopened his eyes and managed to fix a wavering, dull-eyed glance on\nStrange. Slowly, with such painful precision that it chewed apart\nClint\u2019s gut, Stark pulled his arm from Bruce\u2019s shoulders. He\nalmost toppled right over, only Parker\u2019s quick reflexes keeping him\non his feet, mostly flopped over like the doll Lila used to hang over\nher arm. The sight was sickening in its wrongness. And it only got\nworse \u2013 no matter how much Stark tried to get his knees to lock,\nthey simply wouldn\u2019t. Three minutes of obvious struggling only\nresulted in him gasping for breath and slumping almost entirely\nagainst a completely freaked-out looking Parker. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWhat\nif he kneels?\u201d Bucky asked, suddenly. Clint tried to pretend he\ndidn\u2019t see how violently Bucky\u2019s voice made Stark <i>flinch</i>.\n\u201cThat will still make a line with his body, right?\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Strange\nmulled it over. \u201cIt\u2026 could work.\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cDude,\u201d\nQuill said, quietly, \u201cit\u2019s the best you\u2019re gonna get. And even\nthat\u2019s gonna be a cost.\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Bruce\nmoved back to Stark\u2019s side, and he and Parker helped the trembling\nman into the circle, lowering him to his hands and knees before they\nlet him go and backed away. Stark was exhaling whines of pain, again\n\u2013 no sensory input meant he was feeling it <i>all</i>.\nA particularly guttural moan had Bruce putting a hand on Peter\u2019s\nshoulder to hold the kid in place \u2013 he looked as though he was\nabout to either bolt to Stark\u2019s side or out the door. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\nneed you up straight,\u201d Strange said, very quietly, almost gently.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t take long.\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>With\nmomentous effort, Stark pushed himself onto his knees, weaving\ndrunkenly the whole way and swaying like he was at a concert once he\nwas mostly upright. His face was completely devoid of colour except\nfor the fever-red splotches, and he wasn\u2019t even bothering to try\nand keep his eyes open. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Please</i>,\u201d\nwas all he whispered. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Strange\nchanted so fast the words seemed to be a blur, making motions from\nStark\u2019s face to the ground and back up again. The circle glowed,\nStark\u2019s thigh glowed in response and then the glow rose out of him,\nand Strange caught it and pulled it into pieces in the air. The\nglowing stopped and Stark folded like a puppet with cut strings. <i>(\u201cI\ngot no strings to hold me down\u2026\u201d Whispered gleefully in some part\nof Clint\u2019s mind</i>.<i>)\n</i>Bruce, Strange and Parker all\ndarted forward at once. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Hell</i>,\u201d\nStark groaned. \u201c\u2019s\u2026 gone. \u2018S\u2026 f\u2019ly\u2026 gone\u2026\u201d \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Parker\nlaughed, high and shaky, and the two doctors started attending to\ntheir patient, and just like that it was all over. Crisis averted.\nEverybody could go to bed with relief thrumming in their veins,\nlooking forward to the next day with nothing hanging over their\nheads. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Except\u2026\nthose things never really over when they ended, were they? Clint knew\nthis with a long-aquainted certainty, and he knew he wasn\u2019t the\nonly one on the team who did. But they never seemed to <i>really\n</i>acknowledge that fact. And he\nwas starting to think that maybe they should \u2013 that maybe it wasn\u2019t\nonly Stark who kept the wounds festering, and that maybe even Stark\ndidn\u2019t do it as willingly as Clint had always flippantly dismissed.\n\n</p><p><br/></p><p>Sometime\nnear the crack of dawn, once Clint had finished packing, he returned\nquietly to the medbay. Pepper had gotten in sometime near three AM,\nand she was seated on the bed beside Stark, his head in her lap.\nCurled up against Stark, like he\u2019d been since they\u2019d put Stark\nback on the bed despite gentle reminders that it was over and that\nStark didn\u2019t have to be held any more, lay Parker, dead to the\nworld. Pepper had one hand on his head while the other played with\nStark\u2019s hair, gently, rhythmically. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>There\nwas a look on her face that he\u2019d seen on Laura\u2019s so often that it\ncut Clint straight to the core, burning-agony in its bitter-sweet\nmixing of love and pain. \n</p>",

There was\ncertainly no looming figure or spaceship or giant robot promising\ndoom and destruction as the code-red call had insinuated. In fact,\nthe more they awkwardly stood in a line just off the ramp of the\nQuinjet and watched the traffic try to be more ridiculous than ever,\nthe more Clint began to suspect it was all a prank. Possibly aimed\ndirectly at him. Why else would the call to assemble to save the city\n(<i>again</i>. Damnit, New\nYork) come the <i>day </i>before\nClint was scheduled to have his quiet exit from the team so he could\nreturn to Laura and the kids?</p><p>\n<br></p><p>He\u2019d\nunderstood why the whole team \u2013 including the We Just Helped Out\nThis One Time crew \u2013 had been asked to stay at the New\nAvengers Facility and be as\nvisible as possible in the days following the return of half the\nuniverse. The Snap, as the media had dubbed it, had been a traumatic\ntime for all, and having the world able to see the heroes they\ndepended on all in one, easily-accessable training facility\ndid a lot to help settle a skittish,traumatised Earth back into\nrhythm again. Clint had also understood why, when the almost\nlaughably large team had slowly been whittled down \u2013 person by\nperson so the public didn\u2019t panic; like weaning somebody off\ncaffeine slowly to show them that, look, you can still survive if\nyou\u2019re one cup a day fewer \u2013 to the minimal number of \u2018regulars\u2019,\nhe was one of the last on the list of scheduled exits. He whined\nabout it a little, of course, but he was smart enough to know that\nactual kings who had countries to run, Sorcerer Supremes,\nthunder-gods, still-mostly-broken\nandroids,\nnot-really-an-official-Avenger teenagers with finals to study for and\nwrite and people with a job in the US army should <i>rightfully</i>\nhave been excused before he was. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>He\nwas also just a little unsure of why Banner, who had freely admitted\nhe was going to stay at the Facility\nwhether he was off the official lineup or not, had <i>still\n</i>got excused before him. And also\nwhy the attempt to retain the most human-seeming members until last\nhad meant that the WWE-wrestler with no filter had been given leave,\nbut the smart-mouthed raccoon had been cajoled to stay. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cWell,\nsome people need time to do the villainous destructive thingies,\u201d\nRocket said, as though reading Clint\u2019s mental assessment of him and\nwillingly jumping in to prove his point. \u201cNot everybody can level a\ncity with a <i>snap of his fingers</i>.\u201d\n\n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>A\nvisible wince flowed through the group like a ripple. \u201cDude,\u201d\nQuill groaned, as Rocket snorted and muttered about it being a good\njoke. \u201cToo soon.\u201d</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nSam piped in, falsely cheerfully, \u201cbut only, like, three decades\ntoo soon, so we\u2019re all good.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cNo\nneed for Stark to give away his Inappropriate Asshole Remarks award\njust yet,\u201d Clint chimed in, because he\u2019d forgotten, for just a\nmoment, that whatever tight-knit camaraderie existed while you saved\nthe universe together faded after the first few giddy days of\nrelief-trauma. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Clint\ngrimaced at the quickly-thickening silence that followed his remark.\nA few years ago, Stark would have filled the silence with rapid-fire\ncomebacks of his own, or somebody else would have picked up the\nribbing, and they would have gone into battle snarking and saving\neach other in equal measure. But Stark had not had the job or life\nClint had \u2013 the dual\ncombination that had taught\nhim to let some things that had happened be bygones so that everybody\ncould move on and deal with who they were and what they were doing in\n<i>that </i>moment. Stark\nseemed to put the bandaid on the wound not only to stop the bleeding,\nbut to stop anybody taking whatever was buried under his skin causing\nthe pain out of him, so he could hold it there and <i>feel </i>it\nfor forever. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cWe\nshould split up and look for signs of disturbance,\u201d Steve said in a\nlevel voice, opting to pretend the awkwardness was not near-choking.\n\u201cStar-Lord, you and Rocket go the length of the Hudson and head\ninland. Falcon, Black Widow \u2013 you two work areal and ground from\nthe Civic Centre and work your way in. Iron Man and Hawkeye, same but\nfrom the East River in. Bucky and I will go from Washington Heights\ndown. Rendezvous point is Central Park; keep in contact over the\ncoms.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cWhat\npart of Central Park?\u201d Sam asked, probably just to be otherwise. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cThe\ncentral part of it,\u201d Steve deadpanned back as Natasha smirked.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Stark\u2019s\nfaceplate was down by the time Clint glanced at him, and so all he\ngot was a view of flat, angry gold. Without a word, Stark fired his\nrepulsors and swooped at Clint, who was only not caught completely\noff guard because of how often he\u2019d been Stark-lifted in the past.\nAs he was jerked into the air, still in complete silence, he couldn\u2019t\nhelp but warily think back to their very first battle together.\n<i>Better clench up, Legolas</i>.\nAs annoying as Stark\u2019s babbling and needling could be, the silence\nfrom the man was\u2026 unnerving. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cGoing\ndown,\u201d Stark said, suddenly, and a moment later Clint found himself\nbeing dropped, rather roughly, onto a rooftop. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>He\nstumbled and staggered a little, but managed to stick the landing,\nbiting down on his tongue to stop himself from lashing out at Stark\nfor the obviously intentional hard drop. Stark still acted like a\npetty child, and it irked Clint to no end. Muttering to himself, he\nstarted surveying their area, making his own way over rooftops so\nthat he didn\u2019t have to rely on Stark again. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d\nStark asked a while later, out of sight in the skies somewhere. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cI\nsee two teenagers who <i>really shouldn\u2019t be doing that</i>,\u201d\nClint said, raising his voice so that the duo heard him, jumped, and\nthen scampered away guiltily. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cSaving\nthe world one unplanned pregnancy at a time,\u201d Tony said dryly. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve\nheard \u2018friendly neighbourhood hero\u2019 is the in thing, this year,\u201d\nClint fired back, eyes roving over the latest street he hovered over.\n\n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cThe\nyellow butterfly headed toward you as you ask, \u2018is this the way I\nbecome cool and relevant again?\u2019 is labelled \u2018copying a literal\nteenager\u2019.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Clint\nblinked, hard, his train of thought suddenly crashing to a halt.\n\u201cWait, <i>what</i>?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cGuys,\nI think we found what we were called in to fight.\u201d Quill\u2019s voice\nsounded grimly bemused through the com-link. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve been at\nit for a while, looks like.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201c\u2018They\u2019,\nas in, multiple hostiles?\u201d Steve demanded. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cThat\ndepends,\u201d Quill replied. \u201cAre you calling the magical, sentient\nvines the enemy, or the being making them appear?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cThe\nvines are <i>sentient</i>?\u201d\nSam sounded a little out of breath. \u201cHow do we know this?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cGuessed,\u201d\nRocket replied, \u201c\u2019cause deciding the vines can hit for themselves\nand being proved you were an idiot is a lot less stupid than the\nother way.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cI\nsay we agree with the guy who has a tree as a best friend,\u201d Bucky\npiped up, mildly. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cWhere\nare you two?\u201d Steve asked, and Clint caught sight of Stark heading\nhis way, ready, no doubt, to pick Clint up and take him to the battle\nscene. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cHiding\nbehind a building,\u201d Rocket said. \u201cWatching the vine-making-person\nmake vines and destroy stuff with them.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Where\n</i>is this building?\u201d Steve\nclarified. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cIn\nbetween another two. There\u2019s a Starbucks on the corner,\u201d Rocket\nsaid, helpfully. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nnear the river?\u201d Quill added. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cRiverside\nBoulevard, Lincoln Square, New York,\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y\u2019s voice chimed\nin before anybody could start to get too exasperated. \u201cHead for the\nopen patch of green just off the Joe DiMaggio Highway.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cAh,\ncrap; it <i>had </i>to be\nnear the highway,\u201d Sam sighed. \u201cThose kinds of battles <i>always\n</i>end up messy.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cStar-Lord,\nRocket \u2013 wait until you have backup to engage. First on the scene,\ntry and contain the threat before it reaches the highway,\u201d Steve\nordered. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Once\nagain, Clint got almost no warning before Stark grabbed him and\nlifted him, somewhat painfully, into the sky. This time, the silence\nwas calculating instead of awkward; Clint was sure Stark was having\nconversations with his AI as he flew, and he himself needed the time\nto get his head around the idea of <i>sentient vines</i>.\nIt didn\u2019t take much searching to find them; they were a sickly\nyellow-green, as thick as a manhole at their smallest and already\ncausing some destruction to buildings and roads along the boulevard.\nAnd some of them had started climbing their way up the supports of\nthe highway. There was little, Clint realised, that a bow and arrow\ncould do against them, even if the arrow exploded. So his job would\nthen be Team Two: Take Out The Mad Creator. For that, he had to find\nsaid person who, according to Quill and Rocket, had given them the\nshake when they realised they were being watched. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cIron\nMan, drop me on the tallest roof around here so I can find this guy\nand take him down.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Steve\nimmediately sorted the rest of the team into the two groups, guessing\nat Clint\u2019s intentions \u2013 Natasha and Sam were with him, while the\nrest of the team got to blow up some plants. Stark obeyed his request\nbut, once again, did so harshly, leaving Clint to skid and swear\nunder his breath at the sharp pain of impact. He turned to glare at\nthe man, but Stark was already gone. So, instead, Clint called him a\nfew choice names in his head and then set about finding his target. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d\nStark panted. \u201cThese things are more vicious than a pissed-off\nchihuahua.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cAt\nleast they don\u2019t grow back rapidly when you tear them in pieces,\u201d\nNatasha said, mildly. \u201cOr spray awful things at you. Plus, they\ndon\u2019t seem to be truly sentient \u2013 just alive enough to have a\npurpose.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cHow\u2026motivating\u2026\u201d\nStark bit back, sounding completely out of breath. \u201cHey, Black\nWidow \u2013\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nyou <i>dare </i>say you\u2019re\nbringing the party to us.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cThis\nis why\u2026I never\u2026 invite you\u2026anywhere fun,\u201d Stark panted. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>The\ntalk over the com-link reduced itself to sudden, loud exclamations of\npain or frustration and the occasional directive or query. It didn\u2019t\ntake too long for them to track down their villain of the week, but\nfinding them and being able to stop them from creating new vines or\nusing the ones already created to give the team a rather good\nthrashing turned out to be two completely different ballgames.\nClint\u2019s aim was as true as ever, but none of his arrows seemed to\nhave any effect on the vaguely humanoid being that swatted their\nattempts to reach them aside like annoying flies before continuing to\n<i>sing </i>vines from the\nearth. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Eventually,\nNatasha managed to get close enough to ram one of her Bites onto the\nhostile\u2019s neck. They threw her off in a blast of pale-yellow light,\nbut still went down to their knees, twitching under the force of the\nweapon. Clint fired a taser arrow at the being just as they looked\nlike they were about to get to their feet, saw Natasha trying to\nfight her way out of the thick vines wrapping around her, saw Sam,\nwings thrown off, start to run toward their newly felled enemy in an\nattempt to reach them before Clint\u2019s arrow\u2019s effect wore off.\nClint knew that neither he nor Sam would reach their target in time \u2013\nthe hostile was too well protected against their attacks. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cNeed\nsome help!\u201d Sam yelled over the com, running as fast as he could\ndespite the probable futility. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cOn\nit,\u201d Stark\u2019s voice answered back, and a moment later the Iron Man\nsuit dropped like a stone from the sky, hurtling toward their\ntwitching, struggling enemy. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Clint\nsaw Sam falter for a few steps at the sight, a mask of horror and\nfamiliarity flashing across his face before he pulled himself into\nthe <i>now </i>and continued\nrunning. Clint, too, continued his rush to reach them, half an eye on\nNat and half an eye on Stark who <i>wasn\u2019t pulling up. </i>Ten\nfeet from the ground, Clint opened his mouth to yell \u2013 what, he\nnever would have been able to say, but his heart was in his throat at\nthe sight of Stark not stopping \u2013 and, almost at the same time, the\nBleeding Edge \u00a0armour peeled away from its creator, dropping to the\nfloor faster than even he was falling like one of those fake\nslime-in-a-tubs his kids played with and creating a sort of\nfunnel-cushion that not only caught Stark as he fell but acted as a\nsort of slide, gently depositing him on his one knee and one hand\njust in front of their slowly-rising enemy. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>And,\nokay, Clint could admit it \u2013 that had been a pretty damn awesome\nmove. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Stark\ngot to his feet, and fashioned crude restraints out of some of his\narmour. He\u2019d managed to lock down three of their enemy\u2019s four\nlimbs before the hostile, until that point still but for the twitches\nfrom the electricity, reared up and slammed their free hand to an\nunprotected area around Stark\u2019s thigh. The accompanying blast of\nlight was much brighter yellow than the one that had swatted Nat\naway, and Stark was blown backwards with a curse of surprise that was\nloud in the otherwise silence of the attack. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Clint\ndidn\u2019t stop to see where or how Stark landed. He and Sam reached\ntheir enemy at about the same time and, with Stark\u2019s armour holding\nmost of the being in place, they made quick teamwork of finally\nknocking their target unconscious. As they slumped to the ground,\nClint drew one last taser arrow and embedded it into the inert form.\nHe wasn\u2019t taking any chances. While the electroshocks worked their\nway through their enemy and Sam readied the restraints, Clint glanced\nup to take stock of the team. Steve and Bucky were quickly picking\ntheir way around still-vicious vines, Rocket was laughing his ass off\nat Quill trying to flail out from under a miniature vine that had\nseemingly snuck up on him and Natasha was half-bent over Stark,\nbleeding slightly but steady, as Stark got carefully to his feet. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cContainment\nvehicle and medical are both on their way. Vines are giving them a\nbit of trouble,\u201d Steve reported as they all regrouped around their\nunconscious and thoroughly restrained enemy. There wasn\u2019t much to\nreply to that, so everybody just stood, getting their breath back and\nidly watching Stark retrieve his nanobots now that they were no\nlonger needed as restraints, coaxing them back around his body until\nthe armour was once again complete. \u201cI want everybody to be\nthoroughly cleared by medical before we start cleaning this mess up,\u201d\nSteve eventually said into the silence. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cUgh.\nWell this takes the fun out of saving the day,\u201d Rocket said, idly\nkicking at the tip of a vine that had been sneaking closer to him. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cWhat\nif we just\u2026 leave them?\u201d Quill suggested. \u201cI mean, weren\u2019t\npeople going on about making New York more\u2026 ecofriendly and\n\u2018green\u2019?\u201d Behind him, there was an ominous crack as one of the\nthick vines began squeezing a support column of the highway. Quill\nsighed. \u201cYeah, okay, fine. <i>Fine</i>.\u201d\n\n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cDo\nit for the vine,\u201d Bucky said, voice and face completely deadpan. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Natasha\nsmirked and Sam threw his head back to look at the heavens with a\ndeep sigh. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>They\nstarted hacking down some of the vines closest to their fallen enemy\nwhile they waited for medical to crawl its way over to them, and even\nwhen the three heavily armoured and manned vans arrived they all\npersonally made sure the still-unconcious being was securely\ncontained within the vehicle and that the personnel inside were aware\nthat they could not mess up and let the tough asshole get loose. Then\nthey all shuffled off to be poked and prodded by medical \u2013 some\nmore willingly than others \u2013 and Clint got to witness the rather\namusing show of a fresh-faced medical professional try and perform an\nexamination on Rocket, who obviously didn\u2019t make the process of her\nfirst genetically-engineered-raccoon examination easier on her. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Steve\nhovered around Bucky, mostly, but then <i>casually </i>made\nhis way over to the medic who had examined Stark and had a quiet word\nwith them, obviously trusting Stark\u2019s past history with skipping\nmedical exams over the man\u2019s declaration that he was in the clear.\nAnd then, as medical trundled away \u2013 without giving them so much as\na damn lollipop for good behaviour, let alone the good dose of carbs\nthey were all probably craving \u2013 the Avengers got to work with city\ncleanup, which, despite the difficulty of hacking apart vines as\nthick as tree trunks that wanted to kill you, was still accompanied\nby memes, bad jokes about Jack and the Beanstalk and the inevitable\nfarming/harvesting cracks thrown Clint\u2019s way. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>As\nalways, the Avengers worked best as a team, each member carrying a\nspecific part of the physical and emotional labour of the task that\nbettered the effort as a whole. But Stark\u2019s repulsors were clearly\nthe winning methods of vine-destruction, managing to cleanly sever\neven the thickest vines in two or three shots where it took everybody\nelse many more. They therefore quickly and wordlessly broke into a\nproduction line \u2013 Rocket, Quill and Stark cut the vines up, and the\nrest joined with the Department of Damage Control crew to peel the\nmostly-dead plants from the infrastructure or haul the pieces into\nthe Department of Damage Control-issued containers that had arrived\nwith said crew about thirty minutes after the battle ended. The extra\nhelp, though a little star-struck in cases, was highly appreciated\nand made the going delightfully faster than Clint\u2019s tired and\nfrankly sore body and mind had predicted. So much so, in fact, that\nit began to look like they\u2019d probably be able to do most of the\ncleanup in one day <i>and </i>before\ndarkness truly fell. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>At\nfirst, Clint didn\u2019t notice that a bottleneck in the production line\nhad formed \u2013 he was focussed on pulling a truly <i>stubborn\n</i>monster of a vine off a\ntelephone pole, and wasn\u2019t paying much attention to his surrounds.\nWhen he finally managed to peel the sucker off, there were about\nthree eager D.O.D.C personnel who rushed forward to take it off his\nhands when he waved it vaguely in the air. One glance around showed\nhim that it was not just because they were fans of his \u2013 there were\npeople in D.O.D.C uniforms awkwardly loitering around every Avenger,\nand even his team members were standing around, hands empty, glancing\nat one another to figure out what was going on. It wasn\u2019t a\ndifficult mystery to solve, really: the rest of the line didn\u2019t\nhave much to do, because the cutting crew was cutting the vines up\ntoo slowly for the rest of them, giving a lack of things to peel or\ncarry. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re\ngoing as fast as we can,\u201d Quill said through gritted teeth when\ncautiously asked about it, and Clint could see the evidence in his\nstatement in the way they worked, throwing themselves and their\nweapons at every hard-to-cut-through, determined-to-advance,\nprone-to-fight-back-viciously vine. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Or,\nin the way Quill and Rocket worked, in any case. Stark, on the other\nhand\u2026 Was he <i>seriously </i>just\nleaning against some half-crushed car, casually watching Quill and\nRocket work? Clint raised an eyebrow and threw a glance over at Steve\nwho, sure as anything, was doing the Eyebrow Thing at the side of\nStark\u2019s armoured head. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cSt\n\u2013 Iron Man,\u201d Steve started. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d\nStark didn\u2019t even turn and look at him. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Steve\u2019s\nexpression grew cautious, and he took his time choosing his next\nwords, aware, just like everybody else, that there were still\ngrenades buried in the spaces between the members of the Avengers\nthat <i>hadn\u2019t </i>simply\ndisappeared when Thanos snapped his fingers. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re\nstill needing all hands on deck, here,\u201d Steve said in a measured\ntone. \u201cWe\u2019re still only about halfway, and it\u2019s already\nbeen\u2026\u201d He glanced at the nearest D.O.D.C crew member, who fumbled\nwith a watch. \u201cTwo and a half hours,\u201d he finished. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cAll\nthat backwards earth tec running out of juice?\u201d Rocket jibed,\nfiring four consecutive shots at a vine without looking, probably to\nprove he could. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cSuit\u2019s\nfine,\u201d Stark said, still not moving. There was a beat and then,\nquietly, even though the suit\u2019s speakers, he added, \u201cI think\u2026\n<i>I\u2019m </i>running out of\njuice.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>For\none moment, Clint was thrown by the soft confession. And then he\nremembered the whining, dramatic, grumpy-sarcastic man Stark had\nbecome those few times Clint had seen him sick, in the past, and he\nsighed. This cleanup operation was about to get a whole lot longer\nand a whole lot more irritating if Stark got the man flu on them.\nEspecially because the two people who could safely deal with Stark\nwhen he was being Especially Starkish were in the Facility\u2019s\nscience lab and in Geneva for an S.I. conference respectively. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cWell,\nif we hurry up, we\u2019ll be done sooner,\u201d Nat said, steadily, gaze\ndirect as though she could find some expression to read on Stark\u2019s\nmask. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>For\nanother moment, Stark didn\u2019t move. Then, without another word, he\npushed off from the car and got back to work. Everybody else followed\nsuit, and Clint was once again able to get lost in the monotony of\nthe job until about an hour later. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cDude,\nyou just took a break, come on,\u201d Quill complained, loud and\nirritated enough that Clint glanced over. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Stark\nwas, once again, leaning against an object, this time with his head\nagainst the pole as well. The last time Clint had glanced up because\nof an over-saturation of tired but still eager D.O.D.C crew crowding\naround him, he\u2019d seen Rocket and Quill still at work while Stark\nsat on the side of the pavement, arms hanging between his knees and\nhead bent. For a moment, a niggle of worry flared in Clint; usually,\nin the suit and in front of a crowd, Stark put on a much better show\nthan this. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cStark,\u201d\nSteve said, managing to sound measured. \u201cWe\u2019re all tired, we\u2019re\nall sick of this\u2026 Let\u2019s just keep pulling our weight so we can go\nsooner than later.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>For\nabout a full minute, there was no answer from Stark. And then, in a\nvoice that sounded unusually mechanical, he said, \u201cI\u2026 really\ndon\u2019t\u2026 feel too good. Something\u2019s\u2026 I think something\u2019s\nwrong. I\u2026 it hurts all over.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cThat\nwoulda worked better if you hadn\u2019t already been cleared by medical,\ndude,\u201d Quill shot back, still irritated.</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cThey\nsaid you were absolutely fine \u2013 barely any bruises or\nscrapes on you, even,\u201d\nSteve put in. \u201cHe told me, personally.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cThank\nyou for butting into personal medical information, Captain Obvious.\u201d\nThis time, the dead, mechanical tone had a snarl to it. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cCome\non, man,\u201d Sam said, sounding tired but still trying to be soothing.\n\u201cJust\u2026\u201d He waved a hand. \u201cIt sucks to be out here doing this,\nbut we\u2019re all here and at least you don\u2019t have alien-plant sap\nall over you that smells like your grandma\u2019s shoes after a hot\nday.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cThe\nD.O.D.C is here \u2013 this is their job,\u201d Stark started, finally\nlifting his head so he could turn it to where Steve stood. \u00a0\n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nour job, too. It always has been our job to \u2013\u201d Steve didn\u2019t get\nto finish. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cTo\nwhat, Rogers? To be <i>held accountable </i>for\nour actions? Is that what you were about to say?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Bucky,\nprobably subconsciously, slidled closer to Steve. The D.O.D.C humans\nall looked about one second away from panicking. Natasha met Clint\u2019s\neyes, and Clint gave her a small nod of understanding. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cOkay,\nlook. This is my last day here, and I want to go home to see in\nperson that my youngest son now enjoys eating the chicken\u2019s crap he\nfinds in the yard. That means getting this done and getting back to\nthe coast without another episode of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>.\nSo how about I take Stark and we go and clean up that small patch of\nvines on that one skyscraper they\u2019re colonising to give everybody a\ngood break? Stark, I\u2019ll even pretend you pulled your weight whether\nyou do so or not. How\u2019s that?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Steve\nopened his mouth, then sighed, shut his eyes briefly, and nodded.\nStark jerked away from the lamppost, made his way over to Clint \u2013\nlike an angry teenager in combat boots; <i>stomp, stomp, stomp</i>\n\u2013 grabbed him without a word and lifted him once more into the air.\n\n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>This\ntime, he dropped Clint so suddenly and so hard that Clint couldn\u2019t\nkeep his footing and ended up half-sprawling, scraping his right side\nand his knees as he tried to stop his skid across the roof before he\nfell over the other side. The spike of surprise and pain ebbed and,\nin its place, anger reared. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cOkay,\nseriously, what the ever-loving \u2013 \u201d Stark was on the roof, too.\nOn his hands and knees, with the faceplate peeled away, retching\nslightly onto the roof in front of him. The anger lowered to a\nsimmer, but didn\u2019t completely go away. \u201cStark?\u201d There was no\nanswer, so Clint got up and moved closer. \u201cHey\u2026\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cPiss\noff,\u201d Stark gasped at him. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Clint\nscowled and flipped him the bird in response, even though Stark had\nhis eyes squeezed tightly shut. \u201cAsshole; I\u2019m trying to help.\nWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cNothing\n\u2013 medical cleared me, remember?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Clint\ngroaned out loud. \u201cYeah, Stark \u2013 sullen, smart-ass teenager\nresponses to these sorts of questions always work out well for\neverybody. Keep sticking your head further up your own ass.\u201d Once\nagain \u2013 too many times for that day, Clint suddenly realised \u2013\nStark remained silent, his eyes distant and slightly unfocused as he\nslowly rose to his feet. Clint couldn\u2019t miss the wince, even if it\ndid look like Stark tried to hide it. \u201cCome on, man. What does\nF.R.I.D.A.Y say, then?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>He\nread the answer in the tense silence and the way Stark would not look\nat him \u2013 his AI, it seemed, agreed with medical in their assessment\nthat Stark was completely fine. Clint frowned at Stark\u2019s face and\nposture and mulled things over for a beat or two before deciding that\nwhile he wasn\u2019t qualified to assess what was making Stark think he\nwas not fine when everybody was telling him otherwise, he was\nqualified to know Stark shouldn\u2019t be around helping to make New\nYork Tarzan unfriendly once more. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>His\nprevious offer to cover for Stark had been sarcastic and aimed at\nstopping a stupid intra-team bickering session. This time, the offer\nwas crafted in complete sincerity and the desire to offer an olive\nbranch and get Stark the break he needed to figure out what was going\non with him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just skip out on the rest of this?\nTag somebody else in to do your part for you, instead.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Even\nas the words left his mouth, Clint realised his fatal error in the\nway he\u2019d phrased things. He immediately tried to backtrack and take\naway the implications he hadn\u2019t meant to make, but Stark\u2019s head\nsnapped towards him and there was suddenly cold ice in his expression\nand in his voice when he told Clint where to go and stick it. Before\nClint could get out more than <i>I didn\u2019t mean</i>,\nStark\u2019s faceplate was once again covering his face, and he\u2019d\nlaunched himself into the air so he could start firing at the vines\nthey were supposed to be taking down. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Clint\nthrew up his hands in disgust, irritated at both Stark and himself,\nand let the man go. <br></p><hr><p>\nThe\nboots of the Iron Man armour hit the floor of Tony\u2019s lab and,\ndespite the armour still encasing him, Tony immediately stumbled into\na wall and then collapsed in an undignified heap on the floor. For a\nlong moment, he could hear nothing except his own harsh, uneven\nbreathing and the ringing empty fullness of his head, throbbing\naround in meaningless circles. The only thing that stood out in the\nfog and the confusion was the pain that radiated through his entire\nbody. He\u2019d felt bone-deep agony, before, and this somehow went even\n<i>deeper</i>, to an\nintensity that his mind simply could not wrap itself around. It felt\nlike all the non-hurting a body usually did by default was being\n<i>pulled </i>out of him inch\nby agonising inch; a deep <i>drag </i>he\ncould subconsciously feel but not pinpoint or explain, making his\nbones and veins and very atoms howl in agony every time the tide\ninside of him went out and pulled more of the un-pain and energy out\nof him, leaving him with nothing but the opposite of un-pain\n<i>everywhere</i> in streaks\nof fire. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201c-\nhave them come to the Facility at once.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>F.R.I.D.A.Y\u2019s\nvoice faded in from some distant universe, and he spoke his first\nthought out loud. \u201cThough\u2019 I muted\u2026you.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIn\nthe suit, Boss, you did. Not in the Facility.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>Any\nother time he would have been proud of her for managing to interpret\nhis slurred words, or would have been nostalgically bittersweet by\nthe way she was starting to pick up inflection in her words. JARVIS\nhad taken longer to do that, but once he\u2019d gotten the hang of it\u2026\nNobody could do exasperatedly-worried like JARVIS could. But this\ntime, those observations were mere flickers on a mental screen\nusually buzzing with so many different things at once, now reduced to\nabsolute Blue Screen meltdown. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWh\u2019er\nyou saying?\u201d He\u2019d missed the first part of her statement, and\nthought it could be important. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nin the process of scanning you using my Facility capabilities, and\nthen I\u2019m sending the data to medical to \u2013 \u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOverride,\u201d\nhe said, at once, still aware enough to know to do that. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBoss,\nyour temperature is currently 103.8 and showing no signs of slowing\ndown -\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThis\u2019s\nwhy I\u2019uted you in\u2019th suit,\u201d Tony reminded her, trying to make\nhis tone one of warning while he shut his eyes, rolled his forehead\nto the wall and unsuccessfully tried to swallow a low whine of pain. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAnd\nI still cannot detect the reason for it,\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y finished, not\nat all cowed. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201c\u2019zactly,\nFri,\u201d Tony panted, fingers unknowingly scrabbling against the wall\nand floor as he sought a purchase he could not grasp in the waves of\npain. \u201cMedical\u2026 checked. You\u2026 checked. Nothing\u2026 wron-\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>He\nwas too far awash in the pain to register that he was making loud,\nunrestrained howl-moans of pain, or that he was near-writhing against\nthe wall. Instinctively, he curled in on himself, clutching as hard\nas he could. And, miraculously, his touch helped cut off the pain. As\nthe after-effects receded, he dimly heard F.R.I.D.A.Y talking to him\nagain. Probably the same thing she\u2019d been warning him about for\nhours: his body was trying to fight off some illness that didn\u2019t\nexist. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Hell,\nhe was so tired. And, apparently, not breathing right, he realised a\nfuzzy moment or several later, rectifying this by taking in a deep\nbreath that sounded like a death rattle. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBoss,\n<i>please</i>.\u201d He\u2019d\nnever heard his AI beg before. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNot\u2026\nwasting people\u2019s\u2026 time\u2026 with\u2026 nothing\u2026\u201d Tony ground out\nat her, gripping himself tighter as an instinctive experiment, and\nlaughing slightly breathlessly when the hard pressure on his limbs\nnumbed the pain. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThis\nis <i>not </i>nothing,\u201d\nF.R.I.D.A.Y insisted, and then continued with words Tony didn\u2019t\nbother to listen to because his exhausted, burning, pain-overided\nmind was trying to latch on to the blessed relief he\u2019d just\naccidentally discovered. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Pressure\nstopped the pain. He could almost stand to exist in his skin, again,\nnow that he was gripping himself as hard as he could. But\u2026 <i>but</i>.\nHis grip was fever-weak. And he could only put pressure on certain\npoints. The energy-sapping pulls of agony still happened in the parts\nof his body he was currently unable to hug, and he could feel his\nability to keep a tight hold on himself slipping. He was shaking too\nhard to keep it up for long. He needed something that would put\npressure <i>everywhere</i>.\nHe needed something <i>heavy</i>\n\u2013 stronger than he could grip. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Couch.\nThere was a couch in his lab. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Getting\nto it would mean he\u2019d have to uncurl himself. That would mean\nagony. And\u2026 he didn\u2019t know if he could reach it. F.R.I.D.A.Y\ncontrolling the armour had been the only thing that had gotten him in\nthe air after Steve called the end of cleanup, let alone back to the\nFacility and safely through the entry hatch into his lab. And\u2026 oh.\nThe armour was currently not around him, any more. When had it\nreceded? Had he done that? \n</p><p><br></p><p>Wave\nof agony to get him back on track. Couch. Right. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Couldn\u2019t\nget there. Wasn\u2019t strong enough. Had to get the couch to him. How?\nWho could he possibly call? The rest of the team was probably still\non their way over on the Quinjet. And they all knew nothing was wrong\nwith him. Couldn\u2019t call Bruce, either. Bruce was a doctor. Ish.\nHe\u2019d know there was nothing wrong with Tony, too, and his gentle\nindulging Tony sarcastically would drive Tony up the wall when it was\nbeing done while the agony -</p><p><br></p><p>-hit\nin a wave like it just did. Couch. He had to get the couch over to\nhim. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Armour.\nThe armour was strong enough to do so. He had an old model in the lab\nfor (security, always security, just in case) aesthetic nostalgia.\nF.R.I.D.A.Y could pilot it. Could use it to drop the couch on him. He\nthought he ordered her to do so, but there was silence in the lab for\nso long that he started to think he\u2019d only <i>thought </i>of\ntelling her and hadn\u2019t actually made the words come out. \n</p><p><br></p><p>And\nthen, slowly, \u201cI\u2019m choosing to ignore that request, Boss, because\nit measures in the realm of delirium and conflicts with my primary\nobjective.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y\u2026\njust\u2026 get the armour\u2026\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBoss,\nI cannot -\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOverride\u2026\ncode\u2026\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBoss,\nI implore you not to -\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOverride\u2026\ncode\u2026\u201d <br></p><hr><p>\n\u201cHey, Bruce?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\nBruce looked up curiously from whatever he was reading at Clint\u2019s\nvoice. \u00a0\u201cYou guys are back,\u201d he said, sounding relieved. \u201cThat\nwas a long one.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cCleanup sucked,\u201d Clint said, succinctly. \u201cMore on the news at\neight.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\nBruce grinned. \u201cAlready got all the cool footage from Twitter,\u201d\nhe said, sounding a little smug. Then he took off his glasses and\nsaid, more seriously, \u201cWhat can I help you with?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cGot a scrape I think is full of stuff that I can\u2019t reach myself\nthat I got after medical had already checked us and left,\u201d Clint\nsaid evenly, hoping Bruce wouldn\u2019t ask how he got it so he didn\u2019t\nhave to choose whether to lie or to rat out Stark to one of his\nclosest friends and put Banner in the middle. Again. \u201cCould use\nsome help.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\nBruce winced in sympathy and stood immediately, gesturing Clint\ntoward the small but efficient medbay. \u201cSure, of course.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\nBut when they neared the room, there was a blinking light on one of\nthe walls that made Clint frown. \u201cHey, isn\u2019t that an alert from\nF.R.I.D.A.Y?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\nStark hadn\u2019t put her all over the old compound as he had in the\ntower, but she was inserted in certain key rooms, of which the medbay\nwas one. The light meant she\u2019d tried to reach somebody, hadn\u2019t\nfound them, and had left a message. Bruce picked up the pace\nsomewhat, opened the door, and called the AI\u2019s name in question. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cDoctor Banner, your presence is needed in Mr Stark\u2019s lab\nimmediately,\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y rattled, so fast the words were nearly\nonly a blur of sound. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\nFor a moment, it threw both men. And then Bruce was whirling on his\nheel and half jogging to Stark\u2019s lab and Clint was following,\ndespite the pace pulling on his fresh scrapes and bruises, because\nsomething in his gut was telling him that something was very, very\nwrong. Bruce keyed in his access code to the lab, hauled open the\ndoor, and immediately breathed something in a language Clint didn\u2019t\nunderstand. He got the gist, though, and a moment later he added an\nEnglish equivalent when he saw Stark starfished on the ground with a\nlarge sofa pinning everything from his neck down. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y, what happened?\u201d Bruce asked as they both rushed to\nStark\u2019s side and, without needing to ask the other for assistance,\nhauled the sofa off of him. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cBoss used an override code to make me pilot the old armour to drop\nthe couch on him,\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y said, her voice flatter and more\nmechanical than Clint had ever heard it. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cWhat? Why the <i>hell </i>did he do that?\u201d Clint asked,\nincredulously staring at the seemingly unconscious genius while Bruce\nknelt at his side and started poking and prodding at him. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cBoss wasn\u2019t\u2026 he wasn\u2019t being very coherent at the time, but\nhe said something about the pressure helping to ease the pain.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cWhat \u2013 \u201d Clint started, but Bruce beat him to a question, his\nvoice authoritative and clipped. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y, what\u2019s his temp?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cCurrently 104.3, Doctor Banner.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cCause?\u201d Bruce fired out as Clint swore again, a swoop of concern\nand deep, aching guilt beginning to turn his stomach. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cNone found.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\nBruce jerked a little in shock, his hands all over Stark\u2019s neck and\nforehead. \u201cWhat do you mean, there\u2019s no cause?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cMedical scans at the scene of the battle, and subsequent scans\ndone by the suit and the equipment present in this room have revealed\nthat there is no cause for Mr Stark to have a fever. There is no sign\nof any pathogens or infections, and the only other physical wounds\nare minor bruising and abrasions and the three broken ribs that\noccurred due to the impact of the sofa.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\nClint realised, sort of numbly, that F.R.I.D.A.Y\u2019s suddenly\nmonotonous speech pattern sounded awfully like some S.H.E.I.L.D\nagents he knew when they were both panicked and trying not to be, and\novercome with guilt. He pushed the thought away and focused on Bruce\nand a pale, unresponsive, sweaty Stark. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cWe <i>need </i>to stop this fever, but I can\u2019t risk giving him\nanything if we don\u2019t know what this <i>is</i>,\u201d Bruce muttered,\nsounding frustrated. \u201cAnd this place <i>doesn\u2019t have baths</i>.\u201d\n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cThere\u2019s the water fixture out back?\u201d Clint put in, helpfully. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\nBruce nodded sharply, once. \u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y, is anybody close to one\nof your speakers?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cNot at present, Doctor, no.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cClint, text somebody, then. Tell them to pour boiling water into\nthe fountain \u2013 I need it lukewarm. And <i>fast</i>. Then help me\nlift him.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\nClint did as Bruce asked without a word, fingers flying over a text\nto Nat, using codewords so she knew he was being <i>serious</i>.\nBruce continued to converse with F.R.I.D.A.Y over symptoms and\nhappenings, but the story remained the same: Tony\u2019s body was frying\nitself, and nobody knew why. Helpfully, Clint\u2019s brain chose to\nremind him of all the early warning signs from earlier that day: how\nStark had been visibly flagging. How Stark had <i>told </i>them\nsomething was wrong. How he\u2019d seen Stark on his hands and knees,\nretching and clearly not okay, and hadn\u2019t told anybody because\nStark was a damn big idiot, and, apparently, Clint was one, too. He\u2019d\nmessed up, he knew. And big time. Never <i>mind </i>that medical had\ncleared him \u2013 Clint should have known better. And <i>done </i>better.\n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\nBruce grabbed Tony\u2019s torso, and Clint grabbed his legs, and\ntogether they began the arduous task of hauling Stark to the back\nentrance of the Facility, where a gaudy water fixture that was\napparently an in-joke between Rhodes and Stark stood. Stark didn\u2019t\nso much as twitch once, and the lack of animation in the man kept the\ngrim reality so fresh in Clint\u2019s mind that he couldn\u2019t quite\nfathom, for a moment, why the rest of the remaining team were all\ngathered around the fountain waiting for him with various amused\nexpressions on their faces. Even Wanda was there, dragged away from\nVision\u2019s cradle-side and standing, cross-armed and bemused beside\nwhere Steve and Bucky both held a giant hot water urn each. Only\nNatasha didn\u2019t look entirely convinced that the world\u2019s biggest\njoke was about to unfold. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cOh, man, are we throwing a sleeping Stark in the -\u201d Sam started,\nvoice amused. And then he must have <i>really </i>caught sight of\nStark, because his tone changed completely. \u201cOh, <i>shit</i>.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\nClint and Bruce didn\u2019t bother to acknowledge him or any of the\nother demands to know what was going on as people either caught sight\nof Stark or got caught up in the confusion about why people\u2019s faces\nand reactions were suddenly saying that things weren\u2019t funny, any\nmore. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cHow warm is the water?\u201d Bruce panted as he and Clint approached\nthe fountain. \u201cGuys!\u201d he snapped, when nobody answered fast\nenough. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cLukewarm, like Clint asked,\u201d Steve said, and Sam hurried forward\nto help Bruce and Clint lift Stark into the fountain water. \u201cWhat\u2019s\ngoing on? What happened?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\nClint relinquished his hold on Stark\u2019s legs and stepped away with\nSam before he glanced back at the concerned, and slightly confounded,\nlooking Rogers. \u201cWe don\u2019t know. F.R.I.D.A.Y has been scanning\nhim, and she can\u2019t find anything wrong. But he\u2019s got a fever of\n104, and we have to get it down, and Bruce says we can\u2019t use\nmedication safely until we know what\u2019s got him feverish and why\nneither medical nor F.R.I.D.A.Y can pick it up.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\nBruce was holding Stark up against the side of the fountain with one\narm, awkwardly, and cupping water over his forehead with the other,\nmethodologically trying to get the water to cool him off. And it\nseemed to be working \u2013 for the first time since Clint had seen him\nthat afternoon, Stark stirred and let out a little wordless noise,\nobviously coming to. And then Banner trickled another handful of\nwater over his forehead, and the water ran over Stark\u2019s face, and\nthe man completely <i>flipped, </i>going from unconscious to wildly\nfighting Bruce in less time than it took Clint to take two full\nbreaths. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cTony!\nTonyTonyTonyTony \u2013 Hey! Hey! <i>Hey</i>!\nLook at me! <i>Look </i>at\nme!\u201d Stark almost managed to twist out of Banner\u2019s hold, but that\nonly plunged him further into the water, which made him thrash\nwilder. Several people took steps forward, instinctively trying to\nhelp but not quite knowing how. \u201cLook at me!\u201d Bruce grabbed him\ntight, again, and hauled him to the wall and then grabbed Stark\u2019s\nchin, forcing the man\u2019s gaze to his. \u201c<i>Look at me</i>.\nYou\u2019re fine. You\u2019re okay. I\u2019m sorry, Tony, I\u2019m sorry. But\nyou\u2019re burning up. And we need to get your temperature down, okay?\nSo you need to stay in the water.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBruce\u2026\n<i>no</i>\u2026 <i>No</i>,\nI -\u201d Stark choked and tried, once again, to get<i> </i>free.\n\n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nsorry,\u201d Bruce repeated, and he sounded it, even though he was also\nvery obviously unrelenting. \u201cI\u2019m sorry; I know. I know. But you\nneed to. I won\u2019t put any more on your head, okay? I won\u2019t. But I\nneed you to stay in the water, Tony. Okay? Please? For me?\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>The\nnoise Stark made was unnameable. \u201cNo\u2026no more\u2026\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNo\nmore on your head \u2013 I promise. But then you gotta stay, okay?\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>Stark\ndidn\u2019t reply, simply slumped, suddenly boneless, leaving Bruce to\nclumsily catch him. And Clint hadn\u2019t done all he could have \u2013\nshould have \u2013 before, but he\u2019d learned a long time ago that a\nman\u2019s current actions and future actions said a lot more than his\npast ones. So he climbed, in jeans but thankfully barefoot, into the\nfountain and plopped down behind Stark and wordlessly pulled him\nagainst his side, holding him above the water so Bruce could have\nboth hands free. Stark was out of it, again; adrenalin all burned\nthrough. Clint wished for the snarky or lewd comments that would\nordinarily have followed his attempts to \u2018cuddle\u2019 Stark in any\nway. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSomebody\nget me Strange,\u201d Bruce called over his shoulder, not bothering to\ncheck who followed his order as he checked Stark\u2019s vitals and then\nbegan pouring water on the parts of Stark, except his face and head,\nthat protruded out the water. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cDoctor,\u201d\nWanda said, quietly, and held up the scarf she\u2019d been wearing to\nBruce. He blinked at it for a moment. \u201cA\u2026 a\u2026\u201d She gave up on\nthe word she did not know. \u201cWet it. For his forehead.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThanks,\nWanda,\u201d Bruce said, his voice becoming the closest to its usual\ngentle lilt for the first time since they\u2019d found Stark in his lab.\n\n</p><p><br></p><p>Bruce\ndipped, wrung and folded the scarf and then placed it on Stark\u2019s\nforehead. The man twitched a little in response, but didn\u2019t\notherwise react, once again seemingly gone to the world. And then\nBruce sat back on his haunches and scrubbed his hands over his face,\nand Clint watched Stark\u2019s chest rise and fall and continued to\npretend he wasn\u2019t hyper-aware of all the people hovering silently\naround and watching, at a loss of anything to do but also not willing\nto let Stark out of their sight. Murmuring started up, but before the\nspeakers could decide to make themselves better heard the usual\nspitting fire oval of a portal appeared just before the door and\nStrange stepped through. He took in the scene and raised one eyebrow\nat the sight of the three in the fountain, looking more bemused than\nworried. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Until\nBruce started rattling off Stark\u2019s medical stats to him \u2013 then\nStrange\u2019s face morphed to one of wide-eyed comprehension before he\nwas leaping forward, ripping off his dishwashing-yellow\ngloves and shoving his fingers on Stark\u2019s neck, demanding to know\nwhat happened. The response he got from Steve did not please him at\nall. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOh,\nso <i>something </i>was\nattacking the city, and <i>something </i>happened\nbetween then and Stark coming home and now <i>something </i>is\nwrong. How detailed, Rogers,\u201d\nhe snapped, gently hip-checking a hovering Bruce out of his way. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMedical\nchecked him out post-battle and they cleared him,\u201d Steve said, a\ntouch defensively. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWonderful\n\u2013 they studied all those years to become <i>professional\n</i>idiots,\u201d Strange fired back\nwithout missing a beat, giving Clint his first real-life encounter\nwith the infamous surgeon he\u2019d heard so much about before the man\nhad taken up magic. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHis\nAI has been routinely scanning him since the battle and has found\nnothing to explain his rising fever,\u201d Bruce put in, his hands\nnervously spinning his glasses around and around. \u201cMedically, he\u2019s\nsound. He <i>should </i>be\nsound.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat\nmagical interferences does his AI scan for?\u201d Strange asked, scarred\nhands finally leaving Stark to hover in a strange formation above the\nman\u2019s chest. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d\nBruce blinked, looked to Clint bewilderedly, and then swung his gaze\nto the rest of the team, looking for answers Clint knew none of them\nhad. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 think she scans\u2026 for magic\u2026\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBut\nthis being you were fighting earlier was magic? And used magical\nattacks?\u201d Strange said in a tone full of barely-restrained\npatronisation. Bruce looked to Steve, who murmured a slightly abashed\naffirmative. \u201cWell, then, I\u2019m thinking the cause of the\nmysterious non-medical fever <i>may </i>be\n<i>magic</i>, then.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>If\nStrange was expecting a reply of some sort, he didn\u2019t show it, but\nsimply started moving his fingers in odd patterns around Stark\u2019s\nbody, muttering things too soft for Clint to hear. Everybody else was\ntensely silent, hovering as close as they dared and watching the\nproceedings like hawks. They needn\u2019t have looked quite so closely \u2013\nnobody could have missed the sudden yellow-green flare that appeared\nfrom Stark\u2019s thigh, right where, Clint was guessing, the Vine\nMaster had slammed an attack into Stark earlier. Strange\u2019s face,\nwhen he stopped his magic and straightened, was grim. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t know if I can combat this magic without the caster. I\u2019m\ngoing to send word to Wong to try, but our best course of action is\nto make the guy who did this help us take it back. Does anybody here\nknow where he\u2019s being held?\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\ncan find out,\u201d Natasha said, at once, and turned on her heel\nwithout waiting for a response. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Strange\nnodded after her. \u201cWhat do we do in the meantime?\u201d Bruce asked\nurgently. \u201cSurely there\u2019s <i>something</i>?\u201d\n\n</p><p><br></p><p>Strange\ntipped his head. \u201cYou can give him whatever fever reducers and\nlow-dose painkillers you have in stock to try and combat the fever.\nOther than that\u2026\u201d Bruce\u2019s jaw worked, and Strange sighed and\nsoftened, a little. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Doctor Banner, but this magic\nis\u2026 It\u2019s a drain. It\u2019s pulling energy out of him in a way that\nhis body is interpreting as an invading pathogen and extreme pain at\nthe same time. There\u2019s no real cause to fight, in this case, so\nwe\u2019ll have to try and tackle the symptoms for now; try to lesson\nthem and make him as comfortable as possible.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>Bruce\nopened his mouth, looking frustrated, then simply sighed, nodded and\nmuttered about going to find some medication, then. Strange knelt\nbeside the fountain and reached for Stark again, checking his pulse.\nHis frown deepened and, dropping his hand, he began to massage\nStark\u2019s chest. Clint let go of his hold, shifting back so that\nStrange had more access, balancing Stark precariously about him. It\nwasn\u2019t three minutes later before Stark began to twitch, his face\nno longer slack but scrunched in discomfort, his exhales starting to\nsound like whines. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re\nyou doing, dude?\u201d Quill demanded. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Strange\nwas frowning even deeper. \u201cThis isn\u2019t me,\u201d he muttered, mostly\ndistracted. \u201cThis <i>should </i>be\nhis reaction; I assumed he was simply too deeply unconscious to\nshow\u2026\u201d He puzzled for another moment, hands hovering over Stark\u2019s\nchest, and even though he wasn\u2019t touching him, Stark began to\nwrithe harder, breaths beginning to turn to pants. And then Strange\u2019s\nexpression cleared. \u201cHow did you find him?\u201d he demanded of Clint.\n\n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cUh\u2026\npassed out? On his lab floor. Under a sofa \u2013 he made his AI drop\nhis sofa on him.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHe\n<i>what</i>?\u201d Sam\nexclaimed. \n</p><p><br></p><p>But\nStrange smiled, slightly. \u201cGate control theory,\u201d he said, just as\nBruce reappeared. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201c<i>Oh</i>,\u201d\nBruce exclaimed, just as Clint demanded, \u201c<i>What?</i>\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThe\ngate control theory of pain,\u201d Strange said, beginning to massage\nagain, but this time doing so all over Stark\u2019s torso. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIf\nyou\u2026 uh\u2026 flood the brain with non-painful input, it \u2018closes\u2019\nthe \u2018pain gates\u2019 in the brain,\u201d Bruce picked up from Strange.\n\u201cSo the more you force yourself to feel something else, the less\nyour brain processes and informs you about the pain.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHence\ndropping a sofa on yourself \u2013 that\u2019s input to the nth degree,\u201d\nStrange said, and then muttered, \u201cDamn, it, Stark, you idiot,\u201d\nunder his breath. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSo\nthat means\u2026?\u201d Rocket said, his voice still blank from\ncomprehension. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThat\nmeans, Barton, that you\u2019d better start holding him very tightly\nonce again,\u201d Strange said, and Clint followed his orders at once.\n\u201cKeep as much input as you can going into him at all times; it will\ndefinitely help.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cStrange.\nI have the location. Let\u2019s go.\u201d At the sorcerer\u2019s look she put\non a smirk that didn\u2019t reach her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m coming with to\u2026\n<i>assist</i>\u2026 in the\ninformation extraction.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>Strange\nsnorted, rose to his feet and then, just before he reached Natasha he\nturned back somewhat to Bruce. \u201cBanner\u2026 I\u2019d add some\nnitroglycerin to the cocktail you\u2019re going to give him.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>Bruce\u2019s\nface blanched. \u201cBad?\u201d he said, sounding resigned. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNot\nyet, but I think it\u2019s going to go there.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cGet\nthe counteraction quickly, then,\u201d Banner almost-demanded, and\nStrange nodded before opening a portal for him and Natasha to walk\nthrough.</p><p><br></p><p>Bruce\nscrubbed at his face, again, for a moment, and then settled beside\nStark and started administering medication. Clint held on while Stark\ngot the shots, and for ages afterwards, until his muscles were\nstarting to strain from the continuous pressure. Bruce took Stark\u2019s\ntemperature with a digital thermometer and then declared they could\ntake him inside. Steve started forward, hesitantly, wordlessly\noffering his strength, but before Bruce could say anything tendrils\nof red wrapped themselves coyly around Stark\u2019s form and lifted him\nright out of Clint\u2019s arms. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhere\nare we taking him?\u201d Wanda asked, calmly, her eyes glowing red and\nher hold on Stark steady. \n</p><p><br></p><p>They\ntook him to the medbay, small as it was, because F.R.I.D.A.Y was\nintegrated into the room and because having sensors on Stark made\nthem feel better, even though they couldn\u2019t help much. Before Wanda\nplaced Stark on the bed, Bruce kicked off his shoes and lay down\nfirst, telling her to put Stark on top of him so he could wrap\nhimself around Stark as best he could. Steve excused himself in a\nmutter to go and call Pepper \u2013 she didn\u2019t know anything about\nthis, yet, and he thought she had the right to. Sam dragged a chair\nto the foot of the bed and began massaging Stark\u2019s feet and\nwet-underarmour-clad legs with practised hands, while Banner let\nhimself drop his face against Stark\u2019s hair, something in his face\n<i>daring </i>anybody to say\nanything. Even Rocket didn\u2019t make a comment, choosing instead to\nslink away and leave Bruce, Stark and Sam in peace. \n</p><p><br></p><p>He\ncame back, though \u2013 all of the team cycled through the room, even\nthough most did not attempt to help massage Stark but simply talked,\nquietly, to Bruce or amongst themselves or sat silently in the\ncorner, keeping watch over something they could not see. Clint took\nover from Bruce when the other man had to relieve himself and also do\ndoctor-y things on Stark, again, and Clint saw him frowning at the\ntablet screen in his hand when he quietly asked F.R.I.D.A.Y for an\nEKG. Unease writhed in Clint\u2019s gut, and, when Bruce was out the\nroom for a moment, he decided to try and emulate the massaging he\u2019d\nseen Strange do on Stark\u2019s chest. It had looked simple enough. And\nit was supposedly to help, right?<br><br></p><p>About\nthree minutes in, Stark jerked almost-violently in his arms. \u201c<i>Don\u2019t</i>.\u201d\nClint supposed the word was supposed to be a snarl instead of the\nbreathless half-moan. \u201c\u2019n\u2019t touch.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOkay,\nokay.\u201d Clint raised both hands in surrender, even though Stark\nhadn\u2019t actually managed to open his eyes. \u201cJeesh, <i>sorry</i>.\u201d\nStark grunted, softly. And then, a few beats later, Clint added\nanother <i>sorry</i> for\neverything since the accords that they hadn\u2019t spoken about. Stark\ndidn\u2019t reply to that, but he did suddenly move so that he was more\nin Clint\u2019s embrace, face almost in the crook of his neck, and Clint\nthought, not for the first time, that the beginning of understanding\nand mending looked flipping <i>weird </i>every\ntime he came into contact with it. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Despite\nwhatever Banner was trying, and despite the fact that Quill had also\ntried his hand at massaging, looking unsure and awkward and red-eared\nbut also determined, Stark continued to deteriorate. His fever\ncontinued to climb slowly but surely, no matter what they did, and by\nthe time evening had turned properly to night he was wheezing rather\nthan breathing, twitching and moaning no matter how hard Bruce held\nonto him from behind or how frantically people massaged. Nat wasn\u2019t\nanswering Clint\u2019s messages, meaning she had nothing to report, and\neverybody was on edge, even Bucky and Steve who had yet to hover\ncloser than just outside the doorway of the medical room. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Clint\nhad just started to wish something, <i>anything</i>,\nwould come and break the silent, brooding, watching tension, when his\nwish was granted in the worst possible way. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHey,\nguys, what\u2019s going on? I couldn\u2019t find <i>anybody </i>in\nthis place and F.R.I.D.A.Y said you were all\u2026\u201d Everybody\nswivelled to face Parker, whose cheery expression slipped somewhat at\nthe sight of the wall of stony Avengers. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHey,\nkid, don\u2019t you have, like, exams?\u201d Sam said, trying to casually\nblock Peter\u2019s view of the medbay. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYeah,\nbut it\u2019s F.R.I.D.A.Y, so I have all weekend, and Mr Stark said\nI\u2026\u201d Peter trailed off. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What\u2019s wrong?\nWhose breathing is all\u2026?\u201d His face turned pale. \u201cMr Stark?\u201d\nhe called. \u201cMr Stark, are you here?\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cKid,\u201d\nSteve started, gently warning, but Parker\u2019s face turned determined\nand he darted and twisted his way into the room. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat\n<i>happened</i>?\u201d he\nyelped, catching sight of Stark, his eyes huge as they turned on\nBruce. \u201cWhat\u2019s <i>wrong</i>?\u201d\n\n</p><p><br></p><p>Bruce\nfilled him in as gently as he could \u2013 everything from the call to\nassemble (<i>\u201cYou should have called me, too! I could have\nhelped!\u201d</i>) to Strange figuring\nout the mysterious non-illness that was currently attacking Stark.\nBanner glossed over how much pain Strange had said Stark was in,\nsimply alluding to the fact that the magic was making Stark\nuncomfortable and that the other input was helping with that. Or had\nbeen, Clint added, silently. It looked like their miraculous\ntemporary cure was losing its effectiveness. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Clint\u2019s\ngrim thoughts proved to be right when Stark\u2019s wheezing turned to\nlow whines of pain, his fingers twitching compulsively even as Bruce\ntried to calm him and asked Sam to administer another shot of pain\nmedication through the IV line. Stark was sweating profusely yet\nagain, and Banner\u2019s face was full of lines of worry. Parker\u2019s\nrise from the end of Stark\u2019s bed was sudden enough that every eye\nin the room turned to him automatically. Ignoring their gazes, but\nturning almost as red as the suit he still wore under his unzipped\nhoodie, Peter crawled carefully onto the bed and then slowly lowered\nhimself on top of Stark before wrapping his arms and legs over him.\nBruce and he had to turn their faces to opposite sides to avoid\nbumping noses \u2013 or something more embarrassing \u2013 but neither of\nthem said a word about it. And, miraculously, neither did anybody\nelse. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThis\nisn\u2019t working,\u201d Peter said into the silence, almost an hour\nlater. He sounded almost <i>angry</i>.\n\u201cDoctor Banner\u2026 his heartbeat.. I\u2026\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\nknow, kid, I know,\u201d Bruce said, heavily. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s\u2026\nthere\u2019s gotta be <i>something</i>.\nI mean\u2026 I mean surely\u2026 F.R.I.D.A.Y, scan him. Search\u2026 search\nother ways to\u2026 to help with pain. We have to\u2026\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>Bruce\nlet go of Stark with one hand and placed it on Peter\u2019s back. His\nface was still turned away from Clint\u2019s corner of the room, so he\nsaw no expression. But there was no missing the stiffness of Parker\u2019s\nspine. How close was it to midnight? He was supposed to leave the\nnext day, early in the morning. Supposed to go back to his wife and\nkids. But Clint hadn\u2019t been able to leave the <i>room </i>for\nhours. If Stark was still trapped in medical agony when his ride\ncame\u2026 Clint was almost positive he knew that he\u2019d be staying put.\n\n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cDoctor\nStrange and Agent Romanov have returned,\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y blurted, and\nClint felt his heart lurch in hope. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Those\noutside the doorway and just within it all flattened themselves\nagainst the walls \u2013 and there was something you didn\u2019t see every\nday; Captain America and the White Wolf trying to make themselves\nsmall \u2013 and Strange strode in, magic already on his fingers. But\ninstead of going straight to Stark he began drawing a pattern on the\nfloor. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIs\nhe seriously doing a pentagram?\u201d Wanda asked, shocked into\nincredulity. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d\nStrange said, simply, while Peter finally gave in to curiosity and\ntwisted to look, doing an awkward pretzel on top of Stark to manage\nit. \u201cSame principle, though. Sort of.\u201d Design complete, he turned\nto the Stark-sandwich on the bed. \u201cWe have to get him inside this.\nBut he has to be concious, and he has to be standing alone.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201c<i>Standing</i>?\u201d\nRocket barked. \u201cDude, I don\u2019t know how hard your cloak banged you\ninto a building, but \u2013 \u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHe\nhas to be able to make a line with his body, or this won\u2019t work,\u201d\nthe sorcerer snapped back, making only a little bit of sense. \n</p><p><br></p><p>He\nleft his magic circle and made it to Stark\u2019s bedside, making Peter\nwithdraw and Bruce look politely away as he began trying to wake the\nman. When traditional methods didn\u2019t work, he sighed and began\nmassaging at Stark\u2019s chest. Clint winced a little, remembering the\ngenius\u2019 reaction to the touch earlier. But even that didn\u2019t seem\nto be rousing the man and Clint\u2019s worry began to sink deeper. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t\nthat\u2026 I mean\u2026 doesn\u2019t it hurt?\u201d It was only because Clint was\nso close that he heard Parker\u2019s very soft question. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNo,\nactually, this is helping regulate his heartbeat a little.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNo\u2026\nI\u2026 uh\u2026 I mean\u2026 <i>you</i>.\nIsn\u2019t it\u2026?\u201d Parker went red, eyes sliding very obviously away\nfrom Strange\u2019s scarred hands. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Strange\nlet out an almost-laugh. \u201cLike hell,\u201d he admitted, voice even\nquieter than Parker\u2019s. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Clint\nsaw Parker lick his lips. \u201cThen\u2026 could you\u2026 teach me? So I can,\ninstead?\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>It\nwas one of the most bizarre sights Clint had ever witnessed \u2013 the\ncounterpart of the Hulk acting as a bottom body pillow to an\nunconscious, sweaty, wheezing Stark while the Sorcerer Supreme talked\nSpider-Man, who was still mostly lying <i>on </i>Stark,\nthrough massaging the genius\u2019 chest correctly. When Peter got the\nhang of it, Strange asked Bruce where he kept a certain drug and then\ncarefully fed it into the IV line. Stark started stirring not long\nafter that. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cPete?\u201d\nhe whispered, sounding confused. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHi,\nMr Stark.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>Clint\nwanted, suddenly, to tell Parker to stop touching Stark\u2019s chest. He\ndidn\u2019t want to have to see the hurt he <i>knew </i>would\nflash all through the kid when Stark reacted violently to Parker\u2019s\nmassaging. But Stark\u2019s eyes roved over Parker, and what his hands\nwere doing, and then they rolled drunkenly, not quite tracking, to\nStrange without so much as an increase in his breathing. The noise he\nlet out was nowhere near any language Clint had ever heard, but\nStrange seemed to half-understand enough to reply. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWe\nknow how to make it stop. We just have to get you into that circle,\nthere.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>Strange\nmotioned Peter to get off, and the kid reluctantly agreed, slipping\nright to the end of the bed until Strange and Bruce started helping\nStark into a seated position \u2013 then he shimmied forward, again, and\npulled one of Stark\u2019s arms over his shoulders while Bruce\ndisconnected the IV line. Single-handedly, Parker managed to heave \nStark off the bed and keep him on his feet, a sight that would have\nbeen comical under any other circumstance. Banner took Stark\u2019s\nother side and they began carrying Stark \u2013 there was no other word\nfor it; the man\u2019s feet weren\u2019t even lifting, his head was lolling\nonto Parker\u2019s shoulder, his entire body slumped bonelessly \u2013 to\nthe magical mark on the floor Strange stood in front of. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cStark\u2026\nit will only take a moment, but you need to be standing for it.\u201d\nStark didn\u2019t react. \u201cTony. <i>Tony</i>.\u201d\n\n</p><p><br></p><p>Stark\nopened his eyes and managed to fix a wavering, dull-eyed glance on\nStrange. Slowly, with such painful precision that it chewed apart\nClint\u2019s gut, Stark pulled his arm from Bruce\u2019s shoulders. He\nalmost toppled right over, only Parker\u2019s quick reflexes keeping him\non his feet, mostly flopped over like the doll Lila used to hang over\nher arm. The sight was sickening in its wrongness. And it only got\nworse \u2013 no matter how much Stark tried to get his knees to lock,\nthey simply wouldn\u2019t. Three minutes of obvious struggling only\nresulted in him gasping for breath and slumping almost entirely\nagainst a completely freaked-out looking Parker. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat\nif he kneels?\u201d Bucky asked, suddenly. Clint tried to pretend he\ndidn\u2019t see how violently Bucky\u2019s voice made Stark <i>flinch</i>.\n\u201cThat will still make a line with his body, right?\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>Strange\nmulled it over. \u201cIt\u2026 could work.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cDude,\u201d\nQuill said, quietly, \u201cit\u2019s the best you\u2019re gonna get. And even\nthat\u2019s gonna be a cost.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>Bruce\nmoved back to Stark\u2019s side, and he and Parker helped the trembling\nman into the circle, lowering him to his hands and knees before they\nlet him go and backed away. Stark was exhaling whines of pain, again\n\u2013 no sensory input meant he was feeling it <i>all</i>.\nA particularly guttural moan had Bruce putting a hand on Peter\u2019s\nshoulder to hold the kid in place \u2013 he looked as though he was\nabout to either bolt to Stark\u2019s side or out the door. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\nneed you up straight,\u201d Strange said, very quietly, almost gently.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t take long.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>With\nmomentous effort, Stark pushed himself onto his knees, weaving\ndrunkenly the whole way and swaying like he was at a concert once he\nwas mostly upright. His face was completely devoid of colour except\nfor the fever-red splotches, and he wasn\u2019t even bothering to try\nand keep his eyes open. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201c<i>Please</i>,\u201d\nwas all he whispered. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Strange\nchanted so fast the words seemed to be a blur, making motions from\nStark\u2019s face to the ground and back up again. The circle glowed,\nStark\u2019s thigh glowed in response and then the glow rose out of him,\nand Strange caught it and pulled it into pieces in the air. The\nglowing stopped and Stark folded like a puppet with cut strings. <i>(\u201cI\ngot no strings to hold me down\u2026\u201d Whispered gleefully in some part\nof Clint\u2019s mind</i>.<i>)\n</i>Bruce, Strange and Parker all\ndarted forward at once. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201c<i>Hell</i>,\u201d\nStark groaned. \u201c\u2019s\u2026 gone. \u2018S\u2026 f\u2019ly\u2026 gone\u2026\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>Parker\nlaughed, high and shaky, and the two doctors started attending to\ntheir patient, and just like that it was all over. Crisis averted.\nEverybody could go to bed with relief thrumming in their veins,\nlooking forward to the next day with nothing hanging over their\nheads. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Except\u2026\nthose things never really over when they ended, were they? Clint knew\nthis with a long-aquainted certainty, and he knew he wasn\u2019t the\nonly one on the team who did. But they never seemed to <i>really\n</i>acknowledge that fact. And he\nwas starting to think that maybe they should \u2013 that maybe it wasn\u2019t\nonly Stark who kept the wounds festering, and that maybe even Stark\ndidn\u2019t do it as willingly as Clint had always flippantly dismissed.\n\n</p><p><br></p><p>Sometime\nnear the crack of dawn, once Clint had finished packing, he returned\nquietly to the medbay. Pepper had gotten in sometime near three AM,\nand she was seated on the bed beside Stark, his head in her lap.\nCurled up against Stark, like he\u2019d been since they\u2019d put Stark\nback on the bed despite gentle reminders that it was over and that\nStark didn\u2019t have to be held any more, lay Parker, dead to the\nworld. Pepper had one hand on his head while the other played with\nStark\u2019s hair, gently, rhythmically. \n</p><p><br></p><p>There\nwas a look on her face that he\u2019d seen on Laura\u2019s so often that it\ncut Clint straight to the core, burning-agony in its bitter-sweet\nmixing of love and pain. \n</p>",

But I\u2019m almost glad it didn\u2019t, because while you certainly deserve all the Christmas presents, you also <i>very </i>certainly deserve \u2018for no other reason other than you\u2019re totally awesome\u2019 presents. Because you are. Thank you for your fic and for being super, wonderfully nice to all who come across your page.

There was\ncertainly no looming figure or spaceship or giant robot promising\ndoom and destruction as the code-red call had insinuated. In fact,\nthe more they awkwardly stood in a line just off the ramp of the\nQuinjet and watched the traffic try to be more ridiculous than ever,\nthe more Clint began to suspect it was all a prank. Possibly aimed\ndirectly at him. Why else would the call to assemble to save the city\n(<i>again</i>. Damnit, New\nYork) come the <i>day </i>before\nClint was scheduled to have his quiet exit from the team so he could\nreturn to Laura and the kids?</p><p>\n<br></p><p>He\u2019d\nunderstood why the whole team \u2013 including the We Just Helped Out\nThis One Time crew \u2013 had been asked to stay at the New\nAvengers Facility and be as\nvisible as possible in the days following the return of half the\nuniverse. The Snap, as the media had dubbed it, had been a traumatic\ntime for all, and having the world able to see the heroes they\ndepended on all in one, easily-accessable training facility\ndid a lot to help settle a skittish,traumatised Earth back into\nrhythm again. Clint had also understood why, when the almost\nlaughably large team had slowly been whittled down \u2013 person by\nperson so the public didn\u2019t panic; like weaning somebody off\ncaffeine slowly to show them that, look, you can still survive if\nyou\u2019re one cup a day fewer \u2013 to the minimal number of \u2018regulars\u2019,\nhe was one of the last on the list of scheduled exits. He whined\nabout it a little, of course, but he was smart enough to know that\nactual kings who had countries to run, Sorcerer Supremes,\nthunder-gods, still-mostly-broken\nandroids,\nnot-really-an-official-Avenger teenagers with finals to study for and\nwrite and people with a job in the US army should <i>rightfully</i>\nhave been excused before he was. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>He\nwas also just a little unsure of why Banner, who had freely admitted\nhe was going to stay at the Facility\nwhether he was off the official lineup or not, had <i>still\n</i>got excused before him. And also\nwhy the attempt to retain the most human-seeming members until last\nhad meant that the WWE-wrestler with no filter had been given leave,\nbut the smart-mouthed raccoon had been cajoled to stay. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cWell,\nsome people need time to do the villainous destructive thingies,\u201d\nRocket said, as though reading Clint\u2019s mental assessment of him and\nwillingly jumping in to prove his point. \u201cNot everybody can level a\ncity with a <i>snap of his fingers</i>.\u201d\n\n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>A\nvisible wince flowed through the group like a ripple. \u201cDude,\u201d\nQuill groaned, as Rocket snorted and muttered about it being a good\njoke. \u201cToo soon.\u201d</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nSam piped in, falsely cheerfully, \u201cbut only, like, three decades\ntoo soon, so we\u2019re all good.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cNo\nneed for Stark to give away his Inappropriate Asshole Remarks award\njust yet,\u201d Clint chimed in, because he\u2019d forgotten, for just a\nmoment, that whatever tight-knit camaraderie existed while you saved\nthe universe together faded after the first few giddy days of\nrelief-trauma. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Clint\ngrimaced at the quickly-thickening silence that followed his remark.\nA few years ago, Stark would have filled the silence with rapid-fire\ncomebacks of his own, or somebody else would have picked up the\nribbing, and they would have gone into battle snarking and saving\neach other in equal measure. But Stark had not had the job or life\nClint had \u2013 the dual\ncombination that had taught\nhim to let some things that had happened be bygones so that everybody\ncould move on and deal with who they were and what they were doing in\n<i>that </i>moment. Stark\nseemed to put the bandaid on the wound not only to stop the bleeding,\nbut to stop anybody taking whatever was buried under his skin causing\nthe pain out of him, so he could hold it there and <i>feel </i>it\nfor forever. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cWe\nshould split up and look for signs of disturbance,\u201d Steve said in a\nlevel voice, opting to pretend the awkwardness was not near-choking.\n\u201cStar-Lord, you and Rocket go the length of the Hudson and head\ninland. Falcon, Black Widow \u2013 you two work areal and ground from\nthe Civic Centre and work your way in. Iron Man and Hawkeye, same but\nfrom the East River in. Bucky and I will go from Washington Heights\ndown. Rendezvous point is Central Park; keep in contact over the\ncoms.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cWhat\npart of Central Park?\u201d Sam asked, probably just to be otherwise. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cThe\ncentral part of it,\u201d Steve deadpanned back as Natasha smirked.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Stark\u2019s\nfaceplate was down by the time Clint glanced at him, and so all he\ngot was a view of flat, angry gold. Without a word, Stark fired his\nrepulsors and swooped at Clint, who was only not caught completely\noff guard because of how often he\u2019d been Stark-lifted in the past.\nAs he was jerked into the air, still in complete silence, he couldn\u2019t\nhelp but warily think back to their very first battle together.\n<i>Better clench up, Legolas</i>.\nAs annoying as Stark\u2019s babbling and needling could be, the silence\nfrom the man was\u2026 unnerving. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cGoing\ndown,\u201d Stark said, suddenly, and a moment later Clint found himself\nbeing dropped, rather roughly, onto a rooftop. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>He\nstumbled and staggered a little, but managed to stick the landing,\nbiting down on his tongue to stop himself from lashing out at Stark\nfor the obviously intentional hard drop. Stark still acted like a\npetty child, and it irked Clint to no end. Muttering to himself, he\nstarted surveying their area, making his own way over rooftops so\nthat he didn\u2019t have to rely on Stark again. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d\nStark asked a while later, out of sight in the skies somewhere. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cI\nsee two teenagers who <i>really shouldn\u2019t be doing that</i>,\u201d\nClint said, raising his voice so that the duo heard him, jumped, and\nthen scampered away guiltily. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cSaving\nthe world one unplanned pregnancy at a time,\u201d Tony said dryly. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve\nheard \u2018friendly neighbourhood hero\u2019 is the in thing, this year,\u201d\nClint fired back, eyes roving over the latest street he hovered over.\n\n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cThe\nyellow butterfly headed toward you as you ask, \u2018is this the way I\nbecome cool and relevant again?\u2019 is labelled \u2018copying a literal\nteenager\u2019.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Clint\nblinked, hard, his train of thought suddenly crashing to a halt.\n\u201cWait, <i>what</i>?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cGuys,\nI think we found what we were called in to fight.\u201d Quill\u2019s voice\nsounded grimly bemused through the com-link. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve been at\nit for a while, looks like.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201c\u2018They\u2019,\nas in, multiple hostiles?\u201d Steve demanded. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cThat\ndepends,\u201d Quill replied. \u201cAre you calling the magical, sentient\nvines the enemy, or the being making them appear?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cThe\nvines are <i>sentient</i>?\u201d\nSam sounded a little out of breath. \u201cHow do we know this?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cGuessed,\u201d\nRocket replied, \u201c\u2019cause deciding the vines can hit for themselves\nand being proved you were an idiot is a lot less stupid than the\nother way.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cI\nsay we agree with the guy who has a tree as a best friend,\u201d Bucky\npiped up, mildly. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cWhere\nare you two?\u201d Steve asked, and Clint caught sight of Stark heading\nhis way, ready, no doubt, to pick Clint up and take him to the battle\nscene. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cHiding\nbehind a building,\u201d Rocket said. \u201cWatching the vine-making-person\nmake vines and destroy stuff with them.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Where\n</i>is this building?\u201d Steve\nclarified. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cIn\nbetween another two. There\u2019s a Starbucks on the corner,\u201d Rocket\nsaid, helpfully. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nnear the river?\u201d Quill added. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cRiverside\nBoulevard, Lincoln Square, New York,\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y\u2019s voice chimed\nin before anybody could start to get too exasperated. \u201cHead for the\nopen patch of green just off the Joe DiMaggio Highway.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cAh,\ncrap; it <i>had </i>to be\nnear the highway,\u201d Sam sighed. \u201cThose kinds of battles <i>always\n</i>end up messy.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cStar-Lord,\nRocket \u2013 wait until you have backup to engage. First on the scene,\ntry and contain the threat before it reaches the highway,\u201d Steve\nordered. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Once\nagain, Clint got almost no warning before Stark grabbed him and\nlifted him, somewhat painfully, into the sky. This time, the silence\nwas calculating instead of awkward; Clint was sure Stark was having\nconversations with his AI as he flew, and he himself needed the time\nto get his head around the idea of <i>sentient vines</i>.\nIt didn\u2019t take much searching to find them; they were a sickly\nyellow-green, as thick as a manhole at their smallest and already\ncausing some destruction to buildings and roads along the boulevard.\nAnd some of them had started climbing their way up the supports of\nthe highway. There was little, Clint realised, that a bow and arrow\ncould do against them, even if the arrow exploded. So his job would\nthen be Team Two: Take Out The Mad Creator. For that, he had to find\nsaid person who, according to Quill and Rocket, had given them the\nshake when they realised they were being watched. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cIron\nMan, drop me on the tallest roof around here so I can find this guy\nand take him down.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Steve\nimmediately sorted the rest of the team into the two groups, guessing\nat Clint\u2019s intentions \u2013 Natasha and Sam were with him, while the\nrest of the team got to blow up some plants. Stark obeyed his request\nbut, once again, did so harshly, leaving Clint to skid and swear\nunder his breath at the sharp pain of impact. He turned to glare at\nthe man, but Stark was already gone. So, instead, Clint called him a\nfew choice names in his head and then set about finding his target. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d\nStark panted. \u201cThese things are more vicious than a pissed-off\nchihuahua.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cAt\nleast they don\u2019t grow back rapidly when you tear them in pieces,\u201d\nNatasha said, mildly. \u201cOr spray awful things at you. Plus, they\ndon\u2019t seem to be truly sentient \u2013 just alive enough to have a\npurpose.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cHow\u2026motivating\u2026\u201d\nStark bit back, sounding completely out of breath. \u201cHey, Black\nWidow \u2013\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nyou <i>dare </i>say you\u2019re\nbringing the party to us.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cThis\nis why\u2026I never\u2026 invite you\u2026anywhere fun,\u201d Stark panted. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>The\ntalk over the com-link reduced itself to sudden, loud exclamations of\npain or frustration and the occasional directive or query. It didn\u2019t\ntake too long for them to track down their villain of the week, but\nfinding them and being able to stop them from creating new vines or\nusing the ones already created to give the team a rather good\nthrashing turned out to be two completely different ballgames.\nClint\u2019s aim was as true as ever, but none of his arrows seemed to\nhave any effect on the vaguely humanoid being that swatted their\nattempts to reach them aside like annoying flies before continuing to\n<i>sing </i>vines from the\nearth. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Eventually,\nNatasha managed to get close enough to ram one of her Bites onto the\nhostile\u2019s neck. They threw her off in a blast of pale-yellow light,\nbut still went down to their knees, twitching under the force of the\nweapon. Clint fired a taser arrow at the being just as they looked\nlike they were about to get to their feet, saw Natasha trying to\nfight her way out of the thick vines wrapping around her, saw Sam,\nwings thrown off, start to run toward their newly felled enemy in an\nattempt to reach them before Clint\u2019s arrow\u2019s effect wore off.\nClint knew that neither he nor Sam would reach their target in time \u2013\nthe hostile was too well protected against their attacks. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cNeed\nsome help!\u201d Sam yelled over the com, running as fast as he could\ndespite the probable futility. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cOn\nit,\u201d Stark\u2019s voice answered back, and a moment later the Iron Man\nsuit dropped like a stone from the sky, hurtling toward their\ntwitching, struggling enemy. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Clint\nsaw Sam falter for a few steps at the sight, a mask of horror and\nfamiliarity flashing across his face before he pulled himself into\nthe <i>now </i>and continued\nrunning. Clint, too, continued his rush to reach them, half an eye on\nNat and half an eye on Stark who <i>wasn\u2019t pulling up. </i>Ten\nfeet from the ground, Clint opened his mouth to yell \u2013 what, he\nnever would have been able to say, but his heart was in his throat at\nthe sight of Stark not stopping \u2013 and, almost at the same time, the\nBleeding Edge \u00a0armour peeled away from its creator, dropping to the\nfloor faster than even he was falling like one of those fake\nslime-in-a-tubs his kids played with and creating a sort of\nfunnel-cushion that not only caught Stark as he fell but acted as a\nsort of slide, gently depositing him on his one knee and one hand\njust in front of their slowly-rising enemy. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>And,\nokay, Clint could admit it \u2013 that had been a pretty damn awesome\nmove. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Stark\ngot to his feet, and fashioned crude restraints out of some of his\narmour. He\u2019d managed to lock down three of their enemy\u2019s four\nlimbs before the hostile, until that point still but for the twitches\nfrom the electricity, reared up and slammed their free hand to an\nunprotected area around Stark\u2019s thigh. The accompanying blast of\nlight was much brighter yellow than the one that had swatted Nat\naway, and Stark was blown backwards with a curse of surprise that was\nloud in the otherwise silence of the attack. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Clint\ndidn\u2019t stop to see where or how Stark landed. He and Sam reached\ntheir enemy at about the same time and, with Stark\u2019s armour holding\nmost of the being in place, they made quick teamwork of finally\nknocking their target unconscious. As they slumped to the ground,\nClint drew one last taser arrow and embedded it into the inert form.\nHe wasn\u2019t taking any chances. While the electroshocks worked their\nway through their enemy and Sam readied the restraints, Clint glanced\nup to take stock of the team. Steve and Bucky were quickly picking\ntheir way around still-vicious vines, Rocket was laughing his ass off\nat Quill trying to flail out from under a miniature vine that had\nseemingly snuck up on him and Natasha was half-bent over Stark,\nbleeding slightly but steady, as Stark got carefully to his feet. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cContainment\nvehicle and medical are both on their way. Vines are giving them a\nbit of trouble,\u201d Steve reported as they all regrouped around their\nunconscious and thoroughly restrained enemy. There wasn\u2019t much to\nreply to that, so everybody just stood, getting their breath back and\nidly watching Stark retrieve his nanobots now that they were no\nlonger needed as restraints, coaxing them back around his body until\nthe armour was once again complete. \u201cI want everybody to be\nthoroughly cleared by medical before we start cleaning this mess up,\u201d\nSteve eventually said into the silence. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cUgh.\nWell this takes the fun out of saving the day,\u201d Rocket said, idly\nkicking at the tip of a vine that had been sneaking closer to him. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cWhat\nif we just\u2026 leave them?\u201d Quill suggested. \u201cI mean, weren\u2019t\npeople going on about making New York more\u2026 ecofriendly and\n\u2018green\u2019?\u201d Behind him, there was an ominous crack as one of the\nthick vines began squeezing a support column of the highway. Quill\nsighed. \u201cYeah, okay, fine. <i>Fine</i>.\u201d\n\n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cDo\nit for the vine,\u201d Bucky said, voice and face completely deadpan. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Natasha\nsmirked and Sam threw his head back to look at the heavens with a\ndeep sigh. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>They\nstarted hacking down some of the vines closest to their fallen enemy\nwhile they waited for medical to crawl its way over to them, and even\nwhen the three heavily armoured and manned vans arrived they all\npersonally made sure the still-unconcious being was securely\ncontained within the vehicle and that the personnel inside were aware\nthat they could not mess up and let the tough asshole get loose. Then\nthey all shuffled off to be poked and prodded by medical \u2013 some\nmore willingly than others \u2013 and Clint got to witness the rather\namusing show of a fresh-faced medical professional try and perform an\nexamination on Rocket, who obviously didn\u2019t make the process of her\nfirst genetically-engineered-raccoon examination easier on her. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Steve\nhovered around Bucky, mostly, but then <i>casually </i>made\nhis way over to the medic who had examined Stark and had a quiet word\nwith them, obviously trusting Stark\u2019s past history with skipping\nmedical exams over the man\u2019s declaration that he was in the clear.\nAnd then, as medical trundled away \u2013 without giving them so much as\na damn lollipop for good behaviour, let alone the good dose of carbs\nthey were all probably craving \u2013 the Avengers got to work with city\ncleanup, which, despite the difficulty of hacking apart vines as\nthick as tree trunks that wanted to kill you, was still accompanied\nby memes, bad jokes about Jack and the Beanstalk and the inevitable\nfarming/harvesting cracks thrown Clint\u2019s way. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>As\nalways, the Avengers worked best as a team, each member carrying a\nspecific part of the physical and emotional labour of the task that\nbettered the effort as a whole. But Stark\u2019s repulsors were clearly\nthe winning methods of vine-destruction, managing to cleanly sever\neven the thickest vines in two or three shots where it took everybody\nelse many more. They therefore quickly and wordlessly broke into a\nproduction line \u2013 Rocket, Quill and Stark cut the vines up, and the\nrest joined with the Department of Damage Control crew to peel the\nmostly-dead plants from the infrastructure or haul the pieces into\nthe Department of Damage Control-issued containers that had arrived\nwith said crew about thirty minutes after the battle ended. The extra\nhelp, though a little star-struck in cases, was highly appreciated\nand made the going delightfully faster than Clint\u2019s tired and\nfrankly sore body and mind had predicted. So much so, in fact, that\nit began to look like they\u2019d probably be able to do most of the\ncleanup in one day <i>and </i>before\ndarkness truly fell. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>At\nfirst, Clint didn\u2019t notice that a bottleneck in the production line\nhad formed \u2013 he was focussed on pulling a truly <i>stubborn\n</i>monster of a vine off a\ntelephone pole, and wasn\u2019t paying much attention to his surrounds.\nWhen he finally managed to peel the sucker off, there were about\nthree eager D.O.D.C personnel who rushed forward to take it off his\nhands when he waved it vaguely in the air. One glance around showed\nhim that it was not just because they were fans of his \u2013 there were\npeople in D.O.D.C uniforms awkwardly loitering around every Avenger,\nand even his team members were standing around, hands empty, glancing\nat one another to figure out what was going on. It wasn\u2019t a\ndifficult mystery to solve, really: the rest of the line didn\u2019t\nhave much to do, because the cutting crew was cutting the vines up\ntoo slowly for the rest of them, giving a lack of things to peel or\ncarry. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re\ngoing as fast as we can,\u201d Quill said through gritted teeth when\ncautiously asked about it, and Clint could see the evidence in his\nstatement in the way they worked, throwing themselves and their\nweapons at every hard-to-cut-through, determined-to-advance,\nprone-to-fight-back-viciously vine. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Or,\nin the way Quill and Rocket worked, in any case. Stark, on the other\nhand\u2026 Was he <i>seriously </i>just\nleaning against some half-crushed car, casually watching Quill and\nRocket work? Clint raised an eyebrow and threw a glance over at Steve\nwho, sure as anything, was doing the Eyebrow Thing at the side of\nStark\u2019s armoured head. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cSt\n\u2013 Iron Man,\u201d Steve started. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d\nStark didn\u2019t even turn and look at him. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Steve\u2019s\nexpression grew cautious, and he took his time choosing his next\nwords, aware, just like everybody else, that there were still\ngrenades buried in the spaces between the members of the Avengers\nthat <i>hadn\u2019t </i>simply\ndisappeared when Thanos snapped his fingers. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re\nstill needing all hands on deck, here,\u201d Steve said in a measured\ntone. \u201cWe\u2019re still only about halfway, and it\u2019s already\nbeen\u2026\u201d He glanced at the nearest D.O.D.C crew member, who fumbled\nwith a watch. \u201cTwo and a half hours,\u201d he finished. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cAll\nthat backwards earth tec running out of juice?\u201d Rocket jibed,\nfiring four consecutive shots at a vine without looking, probably to\nprove he could. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cSuit\u2019s\nfine,\u201d Stark said, still not moving. There was a beat and then,\nquietly, even though the suit\u2019s speakers, he added, \u201cI think\u2026\n<i>I\u2019m </i>running out of\njuice.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>For\none moment, Clint was thrown by the soft confession. And then he\nremembered the whining, dramatic, grumpy-sarcastic man Stark had\nbecome those few times Clint had seen him sick, in the past, and he\nsighed. This cleanup operation was about to get a whole lot longer\nand a whole lot more irritating if Stark got the man flu on them.\nEspecially because the two people who could safely deal with Stark\nwhen he was being Especially Starkish were in the Facility\u2019s\nscience lab and in Geneva for an S.I. conference respectively. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cWell,\nif we hurry up, we\u2019ll be done sooner,\u201d Nat said, steadily, gaze\ndirect as though she could find some expression to read on Stark\u2019s\nmask. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>For\nanother moment, Stark didn\u2019t move. Then, without another word, he\npushed off from the car and got back to work. Everybody else followed\nsuit, and Clint was once again able to get lost in the monotony of\nthe job until about an hour later. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cDude,\nyou just took a break, come on,\u201d Quill complained, loud and\nirritated enough that Clint glanced over. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Stark\nwas, once again, leaning against an object, this time with his head\nagainst the pole as well. The last time Clint had glanced up because\nof an over-saturation of tired but still eager D.O.D.C crew crowding\naround him, he\u2019d seen Rocket and Quill still at work while Stark\nsat on the side of the pavement, arms hanging between his knees and\nhead bent. For a moment, a niggle of worry flared in Clint; usually,\nin the suit and in front of a crowd, Stark put on a much better show\nthan this. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cStark,\u201d\nSteve said, managing to sound measured. \u201cWe\u2019re all tired, we\u2019re\nall sick of this\u2026 Let\u2019s just keep pulling our weight so we can go\nsooner than later.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>For\nabout a full minute, there was no answer from Stark. And then, in a\nvoice that sounded unusually mechanical, he said, \u201cI\u2026 really\ndon\u2019t\u2026 feel too good. Something\u2019s\u2026 I think something\u2019s\nwrong. I\u2026 it hurts all over.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cThat\nwoulda worked better if you hadn\u2019t already been cleared by medical,\ndude,\u201d Quill shot back, still irritated.</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cThey\nsaid you were absolutely fine \u2013 barely any bruises or\nscrapes on you, even,\u201d\nSteve put in. \u201cHe told me, personally.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cThank\nyou for butting into personal medical information, Captain Obvious.\u201d\nThis time, the dead, mechanical tone had a snarl to it. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cCome\non, man,\u201d Sam said, sounding tired but still trying to be soothing.\n\u201cJust\u2026\u201d He waved a hand. \u201cIt sucks to be out here doing this,\nbut we\u2019re all here and at least you don\u2019t have alien-plant sap\nall over you that smells like your grandma\u2019s shoes after a hot\nday.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cThe\nD.O.D.C is here \u2013 this is their job,\u201d Stark started, finally\nlifting his head so he could turn it to where Steve stood. \u00a0\n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nour job, too. It always has been our job to \u2013\u201d Steve didn\u2019t get\nto finish. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cTo\nwhat, Rogers? To be <i>held accountable </i>for\nour actions? Is that what you were about to say?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Bucky,\nprobably subconsciously, slidled closer to Steve. The D.O.D.C humans\nall looked about one second away from panicking. Natasha met Clint\u2019s\neyes, and Clint gave her a small nod of understanding. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cOkay,\nlook. This is my last day here, and I want to go home to see in\nperson that my youngest son now enjoys eating the chicken\u2019s crap he\nfinds in the yard. That means getting this done and getting back to\nthe coast without another episode of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>.\nSo how about I take Stark and we go and clean up that small patch of\nvines on that one skyscraper they\u2019re colonising to give everybody a\ngood break? Stark, I\u2019ll even pretend you pulled your weight whether\nyou do so or not. How\u2019s that?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Steve\nopened his mouth, then sighed, shut his eyes briefly, and nodded.\nStark jerked away from the lamppost, made his way over to Clint \u2013\nlike an angry teenager in combat boots; <i>stomp, stomp, stomp</i>\n\u2013 grabbed him without a word and lifted him once more into the air.\n\n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>This\ntime, he dropped Clint so suddenly and so hard that Clint couldn\u2019t\nkeep his footing and ended up half-sprawling, scraping his right side\nand his knees as he tried to stop his skid across the roof before he\nfell over the other side. The spike of surprise and pain ebbed and,\nin its place, anger reared. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cOkay,\nseriously, what the ever-loving \u2013 \u201d Stark was on the roof, too.\nOn his hands and knees, with the faceplate peeled away, retching\nslightly onto the roof in front of him. The anger lowered to a\nsimmer, but didn\u2019t completely go away. \u201cStark?\u201d There was no\nanswer, so Clint got up and moved closer. \u201cHey\u2026\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cPiss\noff,\u201d Stark gasped at him. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Clint\nscowled and flipped him the bird in response, even though Stark had\nhis eyes squeezed tightly shut. \u201cAsshole; I\u2019m trying to help.\nWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\u201cNothing\n\u2013 medical cleared me, remember?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Clint\ngroaned out loud. \u201cYeah, Stark \u2013 sullen, smart-ass teenager\nresponses to these sorts of questions always work out well for\neverybody. Keep sticking your head further up your own ass.\u201d Once\nagain \u2013 too many times for that day, Clint suddenly realised \u2013\nStark remained silent, his eyes distant and slightly unfocused as he\nslowly rose to his feet. Clint couldn\u2019t miss the wince, even if it\ndid look like Stark tried to hide it. \u201cCome on, man. What does\nF.R.I.D.A.Y say, then?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>He\nread the answer in the tense silence and the way Stark would not look\nat him \u2013 his AI, it seemed, agreed with medical in their assessment\nthat Stark was completely fine. Clint frowned at Stark\u2019s face and\nposture and mulled things over for a beat or two before deciding that\nwhile he wasn\u2019t qualified to assess what was making Stark think he\nwas not fine when everybody was telling him otherwise, he was\nqualified to know Stark shouldn\u2019t be around helping to make New\nYork Tarzan unfriendly once more. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>His\nprevious offer to cover for Stark had been sarcastic and aimed at\nstopping a stupid intra-team bickering session. This time, the offer\nwas crafted in complete sincerity and the desire to offer an olive\nbranch and get Stark the break he needed to figure out what was going\non with him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just skip out on the rest of this?\nTag somebody else in to do your part for you, instead.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Even\nas the words left his mouth, Clint realised his fatal error in the\nway he\u2019d phrased things. He immediately tried to backtrack and take\naway the implications he hadn\u2019t meant to make, but Stark\u2019s head\nsnapped towards him and there was suddenly cold ice in his expression\nand in his voice when he told Clint where to go and stick it. Before\nClint could get out more than <i>I didn\u2019t mean</i>,\nStark\u2019s faceplate was once again covering his face, and he\u2019d\nlaunched himself into the air so he could start firing at the vines\nthey were supposed to be taking down. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>Clint\nthrew up his hands in disgust, irritated at both Stark and himself,\nand let the man go. <br></p><hr><p>\nThe\nboots of the Iron Man armour hit the floor of Tony\u2019s lab and,\ndespite the armour still encasing him, Tony immediately stumbled into\na wall and then collapsed in an undignified heap on the floor. For a\nlong moment, he could hear nothing except his own harsh, uneven\nbreathing and the ringing empty fullness of his head, throbbing\naround in meaningless circles. The only thing that stood out in the\nfog and the confusion was the pain that radiated through his entire\nbody. He\u2019d felt bone-deep agony, before, and this somehow went even\n<i>deeper</i>, to an\nintensity that his mind simply could not wrap itself around. It felt\nlike all the non-hurting a body usually did by default was being\n<i>pulled </i>out of him inch\nby agonising inch; a deep <i>drag </i>he\ncould subconsciously feel but not pinpoint or explain, making his\nbones and veins and very atoms howl in agony every time the tide\ninside of him went out and pulled more of the un-pain and energy out\nof him, leaving him with nothing but the opposite of un-pain\n<i>everywhere</i> in streaks\nof fire. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201c-\nhave them come to the Facility at once.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>F.R.I.D.A.Y\u2019s\nvoice faded in from some distant universe, and he spoke his first\nthought out loud. \u201cThough\u2019 I muted\u2026you.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIn\nthe suit, Boss, you did. Not in the Facility.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>Any\nother time he would have been proud of her for managing to interpret\nhis slurred words, or would have been nostalgically bittersweet by\nthe way she was starting to pick up inflection in her words. JARVIS\nhad taken longer to do that, but once he\u2019d gotten the hang of it\u2026\nNobody could do exasperatedly-worried like JARVIS could. But this\ntime, those observations were mere flickers on a mental screen\nusually buzzing with so many different things at once, now reduced to\nabsolute Blue Screen meltdown. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWh\u2019er\nyou saying?\u201d He\u2019d missed the first part of her statement, and\nthought it could be important. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nin the process of scanning you using my Facility capabilities, and\nthen I\u2019m sending the data to medical to \u2013 \u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOverride,\u201d\nhe said, at once, still aware enough to know to do that. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBoss,\nyour temperature is currently 103.8 and showing no signs of slowing\ndown -\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThis\u2019s\nwhy I\u2019uted you in\u2019th suit,\u201d Tony reminded her, trying to make\nhis tone one of warning while he shut his eyes, rolled his forehead\nto the wall and unsuccessfully tried to swallow a low whine of pain. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAnd\nI still cannot detect the reason for it,\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y finished, not\nat all cowed. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201c\u2019zactly,\nFri,\u201d Tony panted, fingers unknowingly scrabbling against the wall\nand floor as he sought a purchase he could not grasp in the waves of\npain. \u201cMedical\u2026 checked. You\u2026 checked. Nothing\u2026 wron-\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>He\nwas too far awash in the pain to register that he was making loud,\nunrestrained howl-moans of pain, or that he was near-writhing against\nthe wall. Instinctively, he curled in on himself, clutching as hard\nas he could. And, miraculously, his touch helped cut off the pain. As\nthe after-effects receded, he dimly heard F.R.I.D.A.Y talking to him\nagain. Probably the same thing she\u2019d been warning him about for\nhours: his body was trying to fight off some illness that didn\u2019t\nexist. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Hell,\nhe was so tired. And, apparently, not breathing right, he realised a\nfuzzy moment or several later, rectifying this by taking in a deep\nbreath that sounded like a death rattle. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBoss,\n<i>please</i>.\u201d He\u2019d\nnever heard his AI beg before. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNot\u2026\nwasting people\u2019s\u2026 time\u2026 with\u2026 nothing\u2026\u201d Tony ground out\nat her, gripping himself tighter as an instinctive experiment, and\nlaughing slightly breathlessly when the hard pressure on his limbs\nnumbed the pain. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThis\nis <i>not </i>nothing,\u201d\nF.R.I.D.A.Y insisted, and then continued with words Tony didn\u2019t\nbother to listen to because his exhausted, burning, pain-overided\nmind was trying to latch on to the blessed relief he\u2019d just\naccidentally discovered. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Pressure\nstopped the pain. He could almost stand to exist in his skin, again,\nnow that he was gripping himself as hard as he could. But\u2026 <i>but</i>.\nHis grip was fever-weak. And he could only put pressure on certain\npoints. The energy-sapping pulls of agony still happened in the parts\nof his body he was currently unable to hug, and he could feel his\nability to keep a tight hold on himself slipping. He was shaking too\nhard to keep it up for long. He needed something that would put\npressure <i>everywhere</i>.\nHe needed something <i>heavy</i>\n\u2013 stronger than he could grip. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Couch.\nThere was a couch in his lab. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Getting\nto it would mean he\u2019d have to uncurl himself. That would mean\nagony. And\u2026 he didn\u2019t know if he could reach it. F.R.I.D.A.Y\ncontrolling the armour had been the only thing that had gotten him in\nthe air after Steve called the end of cleanup, let alone back to the\nFacility and safely through the entry hatch into his lab. And\u2026 oh.\nThe armour was currently not around him, any more. When had it\nreceded? Had he done that? \n</p><p><br></p><p>Wave\nof agony to get him back on track. Couch. Right. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Couldn\u2019t\nget there. Wasn\u2019t strong enough. Had to get the couch to him. How?\nWho could he possibly call? The rest of the team was probably still\non their way over on the Quinjet. And they all knew nothing was wrong\nwith him. Couldn\u2019t call Bruce, either. Bruce was a doctor. Ish.\nHe\u2019d know there was nothing wrong with Tony, too, and his gentle\nindulging Tony sarcastically would drive Tony up the wall when it was\nbeing done while the agony -</p><p><br></p><p>-hit\nin a wave like it just did. Couch. He had to get the couch over to\nhim. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Armour.\nThe armour was strong enough to do so. He had an old model in the lab\nfor (security, always security, just in case) aesthetic nostalgia.\nF.R.I.D.A.Y could pilot it. Could use it to drop the couch on him. He\nthought he ordered her to do so, but there was silence in the lab for\nso long that he started to think he\u2019d only <i>thought </i>of\ntelling her and hadn\u2019t actually made the words come out. \n</p><p><br></p><p>And\nthen, slowly, \u201cI\u2019m choosing to ignore that request, Boss, because\nit measures in the realm of delirium and conflicts with my primary\nobjective.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y\u2026\njust\u2026 get the armour\u2026\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBoss,\nI cannot -\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOverride\u2026\ncode\u2026\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBoss,\nI implore you not to -\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOverride\u2026\ncode\u2026\u201d <br></p><hr><p>\n\u201cHey, Bruce?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\nBruce looked up curiously from whatever he was reading at Clint\u2019s\nvoice. \u00a0\u201cYou guys are back,\u201d he said, sounding relieved. \u201cThat\nwas a long one.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cCleanup sucked,\u201d Clint said, succinctly. \u201cMore on the news at\neight.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\nBruce grinned. \u201cAlready got all the cool footage from Twitter,\u201d\nhe said, sounding a little smug. Then he took off his glasses and\nsaid, more seriously, \u201cWhat can I help you with?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cGot a scrape I think is full of stuff that I can\u2019t reach myself\nthat I got after medical had already checked us and left,\u201d Clint\nsaid evenly, hoping Bruce wouldn\u2019t ask how he got it so he didn\u2019t\nhave to choose whether to lie or to rat out Stark to one of his\nclosest friends and put Banner in the middle. Again. \u201cCould use\nsome help.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\nBruce winced in sympathy and stood immediately, gesturing Clint\ntoward the small but efficient medbay. \u201cSure, of course.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\nBut when they neared the room, there was a blinking light on one of\nthe walls that made Clint frown. \u201cHey, isn\u2019t that an alert from\nF.R.I.D.A.Y?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\nStark hadn\u2019t put her all over the old compound as he had in the\ntower, but she was inserted in certain key rooms, of which the medbay\nwas one. The light meant she\u2019d tried to reach somebody, hadn\u2019t\nfound them, and had left a message. Bruce picked up the pace\nsomewhat, opened the door, and called the AI\u2019s name in question. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cDoctor Banner, your presence is needed in Mr Stark\u2019s lab\nimmediately,\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y rattled, so fast the words were nearly\nonly a blur of sound. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\nFor a moment, it threw both men. And then Bruce was whirling on his\nheel and half jogging to Stark\u2019s lab and Clint was following,\ndespite the pace pulling on his fresh scrapes and bruises, because\nsomething in his gut was telling him that something was very, very\nwrong. Bruce keyed in his access code to the lab, hauled open the\ndoor, and immediately breathed something in a language Clint didn\u2019t\nunderstand. He got the gist, though, and a moment later he added an\nEnglish equivalent when he saw Stark starfished on the ground with a\nlarge sofa pinning everything from his neck down. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y, what happened?\u201d Bruce asked as they both rushed to\nStark\u2019s side and, without needing to ask the other for assistance,\nhauled the sofa off of him. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cBoss used an override code to make me pilot the old armour to drop\nthe couch on him,\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y said, her voice flatter and more\nmechanical than Clint had ever heard it. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cWhat? Why the <i>hell </i>did he do that?\u201d Clint asked,\nincredulously staring at the seemingly unconscious genius while Bruce\nknelt at his side and started poking and prodding at him. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cBoss wasn\u2019t\u2026 he wasn\u2019t being very coherent at the time, but\nhe said something about the pressure helping to ease the pain.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cWhat \u2013 \u201d Clint started, but Bruce beat him to a question, his\nvoice authoritative and clipped. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y, what\u2019s his temp?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cCurrently 104.3, Doctor Banner.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cCause?\u201d Bruce fired out as Clint swore again, a swoop of concern\nand deep, aching guilt beginning to turn his stomach. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cNone found.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\nBruce jerked a little in shock, his hands all over Stark\u2019s neck and\nforehead. \u201cWhat do you mean, there\u2019s no cause?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cMedical scans at the scene of the battle, and subsequent scans\ndone by the suit and the equipment present in this room have revealed\nthat there is no cause for Mr Stark to have a fever. There is no sign\nof any pathogens or infections, and the only other physical wounds\nare minor bruising and abrasions and the three broken ribs that\noccurred due to the impact of the sofa.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\nClint realised, sort of numbly, that F.R.I.D.A.Y\u2019s suddenly\nmonotonous speech pattern sounded awfully like some S.H.E.I.L.D\nagents he knew when they were both panicked and trying not to be, and\novercome with guilt. He pushed the thought away and focused on Bruce\nand a pale, unresponsive, sweaty Stark. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cWe <i>need </i>to stop this fever, but I can\u2019t risk giving him\nanything if we don\u2019t know what this <i>is</i>,\u201d Bruce muttered,\nsounding frustrated. \u201cAnd this place <i>doesn\u2019t have baths</i>.\u201d\n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cThere\u2019s the water fixture out back?\u201d Clint put in, helpfully. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\nBruce nodded sharply, once. \u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y, is anybody close to one\nof your speakers?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cNot at present, Doctor, no.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cClint, text somebody, then. Tell them to pour boiling water into\nthe fountain \u2013 I need it lukewarm. And <i>fast</i>. Then help me\nlift him.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\nClint did as Bruce asked without a word, fingers flying over a text\nto Nat, using codewords so she knew he was being <i>serious</i>.\nBruce continued to converse with F.R.I.D.A.Y over symptoms and\nhappenings, but the story remained the same: Tony\u2019s body was frying\nitself, and nobody knew why. Helpfully, Clint\u2019s brain chose to\nremind him of all the early warning signs from earlier that day: how\nStark had been visibly flagging. How Stark had <i>told </i>them\nsomething was wrong. How he\u2019d seen Stark on his hands and knees,\nretching and clearly not okay, and hadn\u2019t told anybody because\nStark was a damn big idiot, and, apparently, Clint was one, too. He\u2019d\nmessed up, he knew. And big time. Never <i>mind </i>that medical had\ncleared him \u2013 Clint should have known better. And <i>done </i>better.\n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\nBruce grabbed Tony\u2019s torso, and Clint grabbed his legs, and\ntogether they began the arduous task of hauling Stark to the back\nentrance of the Facility, where a gaudy water fixture that was\napparently an in-joke between Rhodes and Stark stood. Stark didn\u2019t\nso much as twitch once, and the lack of animation in the man kept the\ngrim reality so fresh in Clint\u2019s mind that he couldn\u2019t quite\nfathom, for a moment, why the rest of the remaining team were all\ngathered around the fountain waiting for him with various amused\nexpressions on their faces. Even Wanda was there, dragged away from\nVision\u2019s cradle-side and standing, cross-armed and bemused beside\nwhere Steve and Bucky both held a giant hot water urn each. Only\nNatasha didn\u2019t look entirely convinced that the world\u2019s biggest\njoke was about to unfold. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cOh, man, are we throwing a sleeping Stark in the -\u201d Sam started,\nvoice amused. And then he must have <i>really </i>caught sight of\nStark, because his tone changed completely. \u201cOh, <i>shit</i>.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\nClint and Bruce didn\u2019t bother to acknowledge him or any of the\nother demands to know what was going on as people either caught sight\nof Stark or got caught up in the confusion about why people\u2019s faces\nand reactions were suddenly saying that things weren\u2019t funny, any\nmore. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cHow warm is the water?\u201d Bruce panted as he and Clint approached\nthe fountain. \u201cGuys!\u201d he snapped, when nobody answered fast\nenough. \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\n\u201cLukewarm, like Clint asked,\u201d Steve said, and Sam hurried forward\nto help Bruce and Clint lift Stark into the fountain water. \u201cWhat\u2019s\ngoing on? What happened?\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\nClint relinquished his hold on Stark\u2019s legs and stepped away with\nSam before he glanced back at the concerned, and slightly confounded,\nlooking Rogers. \u201cWe don\u2019t know. F.R.I.D.A.Y has been scanning\nhim, and she can\u2019t find anything wrong. But he\u2019s got a fever of\n104, and we have to get it down, and Bruce says we can\u2019t use\nmedication safely until we know what\u2019s got him feverish and why\nneither medical nor F.R.I.D.A.Y can pick it up.\u201d \n</p><p>\n<br></p><p>\nBruce was holding Stark up against the side of the fountain with one\narm, awkwardly, and cupping water over his forehead with the other,\nmethodologically trying to get the water to cool him off. And it\nseemed to be working \u2013 for the first time since Clint had seen him\nthat afternoon, Stark stirred and let out a little wordless noise,\nobviously coming to. And then Banner trickled another handful of\nwater over his forehead, and the water ran over Stark\u2019s face, and\nthe man completely <i>flipped, </i>going from unconscious to wildly\nfighting Bruce in less time than it took Clint to take two full\nbreaths. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cTony!\nTonyTonyTonyTony \u2013 Hey! Hey! <i>Hey</i>!\nLook at me! <i>Look </i>at\nme!\u201d Stark almost managed to twist out of Banner\u2019s hold, but that\nonly plunged him further into the water, which made him thrash\nwilder. Several people took steps forward, instinctively trying to\nhelp but not quite knowing how. \u201cLook at me!\u201d Bruce grabbed him\ntight, again, and hauled him to the wall and then grabbed Stark\u2019s\nchin, forcing the man\u2019s gaze to his. \u201c<i>Look at me</i>.\nYou\u2019re fine. You\u2019re okay. I\u2019m sorry, Tony, I\u2019m sorry. But\nyou\u2019re burning up. And we need to get your temperature down, okay?\nSo you need to stay in the water.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBruce\u2026\n<i>no</i>\u2026 <i>No</i>,\nI -\u201d Stark choked and tried, once again, to get<i> </i>free.\n\n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nsorry,\u201d Bruce repeated, and he sounded it, even though he was also\nvery obviously unrelenting. \u201cI\u2019m sorry; I know. I know. But you\nneed to. I won\u2019t put any more on your head, okay? I won\u2019t. But I\nneed you to stay in the water, Tony. Okay? Please? For me?\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>The\nnoise Stark made was unnameable. \u201cNo\u2026no more\u2026\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNo\nmore on your head \u2013 I promise. But then you gotta stay, okay?\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>Stark\ndidn\u2019t reply, simply slumped, suddenly boneless, leaving Bruce to\nclumsily catch him. And Clint hadn\u2019t done all he could have \u2013\nshould have \u2013 before, but he\u2019d learned a long time ago that a\nman\u2019s current actions and future actions said a lot more than his\npast ones. So he climbed, in jeans but thankfully barefoot, into the\nfountain and plopped down behind Stark and wordlessly pulled him\nagainst his side, holding him above the water so Bruce could have\nboth hands free. Stark was out of it, again; adrenalin all burned\nthrough. Clint wished for the snarky or lewd comments that would\nordinarily have followed his attempts to \u2018cuddle\u2019 Stark in any\nway. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSomebody\nget me Strange,\u201d Bruce called over his shoulder, not bothering to\ncheck who followed his order as he checked Stark\u2019s vitals and then\nbegan pouring water on the parts of Stark, except his face and head,\nthat protruded out the water. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cDoctor,\u201d\nWanda said, quietly, and held up the scarf she\u2019d been wearing to\nBruce. He blinked at it for a moment. \u201cA\u2026 a\u2026\u201d She gave up on\nthe word she did not know. \u201cWet it. For his forehead.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThanks,\nWanda,\u201d Bruce said, his voice becoming the closest to its usual\ngentle lilt for the first time since they\u2019d found Stark in his lab.\n\n</p><p><br></p><p>Bruce\ndipped, wrung and folded the scarf and then placed it on Stark\u2019s\nforehead. The man twitched a little in response, but didn\u2019t\notherwise react, once again seemingly gone to the world. And then\nBruce sat back on his haunches and scrubbed his hands over his face,\nand Clint watched Stark\u2019s chest rise and fall and continued to\npretend he wasn\u2019t hyper-aware of all the people hovering silently\naround and watching, at a loss of anything to do but also not willing\nto let Stark out of their sight. Murmuring started up, but before the\nspeakers could decide to make themselves better heard the usual\nspitting fire oval of a portal appeared just before the door and\nStrange stepped through. He took in the scene and raised one eyebrow\nat the sight of the three in the fountain, looking more bemused than\nworried. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Until\nBruce started rattling off Stark\u2019s medical stats to him \u2013 then\nStrange\u2019s face morphed to one of wide-eyed comprehension before he\nwas leaping forward, ripping off his dishwashing-yellow\ngloves and shoving his fingers on Stark\u2019s neck, demanding to know\nwhat happened. The response he got from Steve did not please him at\nall. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOh,\nso <i>something </i>was\nattacking the city, and <i>something </i>happened\nbetween then and Stark coming home and now <i>something </i>is\nwrong. How detailed, Rogers,\u201d\nhe snapped, gently hip-checking a hovering Bruce out of his way. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMedical\nchecked him out post-battle and they cleared him,\u201d Steve said, a\ntouch defensively. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWonderful\n\u2013 they studied all those years to become <i>professional\n</i>idiots,\u201d Strange fired back\nwithout missing a beat, giving Clint his first real-life encounter\nwith the infamous surgeon he\u2019d heard so much about before the man\nhad taken up magic. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHis\nAI has been routinely scanning him since the battle and has found\nnothing to explain his rising fever,\u201d Bruce put in, his hands\nnervously spinning his glasses around and around. \u201cMedically, he\u2019s\nsound. He <i>should </i>be\nsound.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat\nmagical interferences does his AI scan for?\u201d Strange asked, scarred\nhands finally leaving Stark to hover in a strange formation above the\nman\u2019s chest. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d\nBruce blinked, looked to Clint bewilderedly, and then swung his gaze\nto the rest of the team, looking for answers Clint knew none of them\nhad. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 think she scans\u2026 for magic\u2026\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBut\nthis being you were fighting earlier was magic? And used magical\nattacks?\u201d Strange said in a tone full of barely-restrained\npatronisation. Bruce looked to Steve, who murmured a slightly abashed\naffirmative. \u201cWell, then, I\u2019m thinking the cause of the\nmysterious non-medical fever <i>may </i>be\n<i>magic</i>, then.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>If\nStrange was expecting a reply of some sort, he didn\u2019t show it, but\nsimply started moving his fingers in odd patterns around Stark\u2019s\nbody, muttering things too soft for Clint to hear. Everybody else was\ntensely silent, hovering as close as they dared and watching the\nproceedings like hawks. They needn\u2019t have looked quite so closely \u2013\nnobody could have missed the sudden yellow-green flare that appeared\nfrom Stark\u2019s thigh, right where, Clint was guessing, the Vine\nMaster had slammed an attack into Stark earlier. Strange\u2019s face,\nwhen he stopped his magic and straightened, was grim. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t know if I can combat this magic without the caster. I\u2019m\ngoing to send word to Wong to try, but our best course of action is\nto make the guy who did this help us take it back. Does anybody here\nknow where he\u2019s being held?\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\ncan find out,\u201d Natasha said, at once, and turned on her heel\nwithout waiting for a response. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Strange\nnodded after her. \u201cWhat do we do in the meantime?\u201d Bruce asked\nurgently. \u201cSurely there\u2019s <i>something</i>?\u201d\n\n</p><p><br></p><p>Strange\ntipped his head. \u201cYou can give him whatever fever reducers and\nlow-dose painkillers you have in stock to try and combat the fever.\nOther than that\u2026\u201d Bruce\u2019s jaw worked, and Strange sighed and\nsoftened, a little. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Doctor Banner, but this magic\nis\u2026 It\u2019s a drain. It\u2019s pulling energy out of him in a way that\nhis body is interpreting as an invading pathogen and extreme pain at\nthe same time. There\u2019s no real cause to fight, in this case, so\nwe\u2019ll have to try and tackle the symptoms for now; try to lesson\nthem and make him as comfortable as possible.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>Bruce\nopened his mouth, looking frustrated, then simply sighed, nodded and\nmuttered about going to find some medication, then. Strange knelt\nbeside the fountain and reached for Stark again, checking his pulse.\nHis frown deepened and, dropping his hand, he began to massage\nStark\u2019s chest. Clint let go of his hold, shifting back so that\nStrange had more access, balancing Stark precariously about him. It\nwasn\u2019t three minutes later before Stark began to twitch, his face\nno longer slack but scrunched in discomfort, his exhales starting to\nsound like whines. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re\nyou doing, dude?\u201d Quill demanded. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Strange\nwas frowning even deeper. \u201cThis isn\u2019t me,\u201d he muttered, mostly\ndistracted. \u201cThis <i>should </i>be\nhis reaction; I assumed he was simply too deeply unconscious to\nshow\u2026\u201d He puzzled for another moment, hands hovering over Stark\u2019s\nchest, and even though he wasn\u2019t touching him, Stark began to\nwrithe harder, breaths beginning to turn to pants. And then Strange\u2019s\nexpression cleared. \u201cHow did you find him?\u201d he demanded of Clint.\n\n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cUh\u2026\npassed out? On his lab floor. Under a sofa \u2013 he made his AI drop\nhis sofa on him.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHe\n<i>what</i>?\u201d Sam\nexclaimed. \n</p><p><br></p><p>But\nStrange smiled, slightly. \u201cGate control theory,\u201d he said, just as\nBruce reappeared. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201c<i>Oh</i>,\u201d\nBruce exclaimed, just as Clint demanded, \u201c<i>What?</i>\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThe\ngate control theory of pain,\u201d Strange said, beginning to massage\nagain, but this time doing so all over Stark\u2019s torso. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIf\nyou\u2026 uh\u2026 flood the brain with non-painful input, it \u2018closes\u2019\nthe \u2018pain gates\u2019 in the brain,\u201d Bruce picked up from Strange.\n\u201cSo the more you force yourself to feel something else, the less\nyour brain processes and informs you about the pain.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHence\ndropping a sofa on yourself \u2013 that\u2019s input to the nth degree,\u201d\nStrange said, and then muttered, \u201cDamn, it, Stark, you idiot,\u201d\nunder his breath. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSo\nthat means\u2026?\u201d Rocket said, his voice still blank from\ncomprehension. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThat\nmeans, Barton, that you\u2019d better start holding him very tightly\nonce again,\u201d Strange said, and Clint followed his orders at once.\n\u201cKeep as much input as you can going into him at all times; it will\ndefinitely help.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cStrange.\nI have the location. Let\u2019s go.\u201d At the sorcerer\u2019s look she put\non a smirk that didn\u2019t reach her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m coming with to\u2026\n<i>assist</i>\u2026 in the\ninformation extraction.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>Strange\nsnorted, rose to his feet and then, just before he reached Natasha he\nturned back somewhat to Bruce. \u201cBanner\u2026 I\u2019d add some\nnitroglycerin to the cocktail you\u2019re going to give him.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>Bruce\u2019s\nface blanched. \u201cBad?\u201d he said, sounding resigned. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNot\nyet, but I think it\u2019s going to go there.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cGet\nthe counteraction quickly, then,\u201d Banner almost-demanded, and\nStrange nodded before opening a portal for him and Natasha to walk\nthrough.</p><p><br></p><p>Bruce\nscrubbed at his face, again, for a moment, and then settled beside\nStark and started administering medication. Clint held on while Stark\ngot the shots, and for ages afterwards, until his muscles were\nstarting to strain from the continuous pressure. Bruce took Stark\u2019s\ntemperature with a digital thermometer and then declared they could\ntake him inside. Steve started forward, hesitantly, wordlessly\noffering his strength, but before Bruce could say anything tendrils\nof red wrapped themselves coyly around Stark\u2019s form and lifted him\nright out of Clint\u2019s arms. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhere\nare we taking him?\u201d Wanda asked, calmly, her eyes glowing red and\nher hold on Stark steady. \n</p><p><br></p><p>They\ntook him to the medbay, small as it was, because F.R.I.D.A.Y was\nintegrated into the room and because having sensors on Stark made\nthem feel better, even though they couldn\u2019t help much. Before Wanda\nplaced Stark on the bed, Bruce kicked off his shoes and lay down\nfirst, telling her to put Stark on top of him so he could wrap\nhimself around Stark as best he could. Steve excused himself in a\nmutter to go and call Pepper \u2013 she didn\u2019t know anything about\nthis, yet, and he thought she had the right to. Sam dragged a chair\nto the foot of the bed and began massaging Stark\u2019s feet and\nwet-underarmour-clad legs with practised hands, while Banner let\nhimself drop his face against Stark\u2019s hair, something in his face\n<i>daring </i>anybody to say\nanything. Even Rocket didn\u2019t make a comment, choosing instead to\nslink away and leave Bruce, Stark and Sam in peace. \n</p><p><br></p><p>He\ncame back, though \u2013 all of the team cycled through the room, even\nthough most did not attempt to help massage Stark but simply talked,\nquietly, to Bruce or amongst themselves or sat silently in the\ncorner, keeping watch over something they could not see. Clint took\nover from Bruce when the other man had to relieve himself and also do\ndoctor-y things on Stark, again, and Clint saw him frowning at the\ntablet screen in his hand when he quietly asked F.R.I.D.A.Y for an\nEKG. Unease writhed in Clint\u2019s gut, and, when Bruce was out the\nroom for a moment, he decided to try and emulate the massaging he\u2019d\nseen Strange do on Stark\u2019s chest. It had looked simple enough. And\nit was supposedly to help, right?<br><br></p><p>About\nthree minutes in, Stark jerked almost-violently in his arms. \u201c<i>Don\u2019t</i>.\u201d\nClint supposed the word was supposed to be a snarl instead of the\nbreathless half-moan. \u201c\u2019n\u2019t touch.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOkay,\nokay.\u201d Clint raised both hands in surrender, even though Stark\nhadn\u2019t actually managed to open his eyes. \u201cJeesh, <i>sorry</i>.\u201d\nStark grunted, softly. And then, a few beats later, Clint added\nanother <i>sorry</i> for\neverything since the accords that they hadn\u2019t spoken about. Stark\ndidn\u2019t reply to that, but he did suddenly move so that he was more\nin Clint\u2019s embrace, face almost in the crook of his neck, and Clint\nthought, not for the first time, that the beginning of understanding\nand mending looked flipping <i>weird </i>every\ntime he came into contact with it. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Despite\nwhatever Banner was trying, and despite the fact that Quill had also\ntried his hand at massaging, looking unsure and awkward and red-eared\nbut also determined, Stark continued to deteriorate. His fever\ncontinued to climb slowly but surely, no matter what they did, and by\nthe time evening had turned properly to night he was wheezing rather\nthan breathing, twitching and moaning no matter how hard Bruce held\nonto him from behind or how frantically people massaged. Nat wasn\u2019t\nanswering Clint\u2019s messages, meaning she had nothing to report, and\neverybody was on edge, even Bucky and Steve who had yet to hover\ncloser than just outside the doorway of the medical room. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Clint\nhad just started to wish something, <i>anything</i>,\nwould come and break the silent, brooding, watching tension, when his\nwish was granted in the worst possible way. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHey,\nguys, what\u2019s going on? I couldn\u2019t find <i>anybody </i>in\nthis place and F.R.I.D.A.Y said you were all\u2026\u201d Everybody\nswivelled to face Parker, whose cheery expression slipped somewhat at\nthe sight of the wall of stony Avengers. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHey,\nkid, don\u2019t you have, like, exams?\u201d Sam said, trying to casually\nblock Peter\u2019s view of the medbay. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYeah,\nbut it\u2019s F.R.I.D.A.Y, so I have all weekend, and Mr Stark said\nI\u2026\u201d Peter trailed off. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What\u2019s wrong?\nWhose breathing is all\u2026?\u201d His face turned pale. \u201cMr Stark?\u201d\nhe called. \u201cMr Stark, are you here?\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cKid,\u201d\nSteve started, gently warning, but Parker\u2019s face turned determined\nand he darted and twisted his way into the room. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat\n<i>happened</i>?\u201d he\nyelped, catching sight of Stark, his eyes huge as they turned on\nBruce. \u201cWhat\u2019s <i>wrong</i>?\u201d\n\n</p><p><br></p><p>Bruce\nfilled him in as gently as he could \u2013 everything from the call to\nassemble (<i>\u201cYou should have called me, too! I could have\nhelped!\u201d</i>) to Strange figuring\nout the mysterious non-illness that was currently attacking Stark.\nBanner glossed over how much pain Strange had said Stark was in,\nsimply alluding to the fact that the magic was making Stark\nuncomfortable and that the other input was helping with that. Or had\nbeen, Clint added, silently. It looked like their miraculous\ntemporary cure was losing its effectiveness. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Clint\u2019s\ngrim thoughts proved to be right when Stark\u2019s wheezing turned to\nlow whines of pain, his fingers twitching compulsively even as Bruce\ntried to calm him and asked Sam to administer another shot of pain\nmedication through the IV line. Stark was sweating profusely yet\nagain, and Banner\u2019s face was full of lines of worry. Parker\u2019s\nrise from the end of Stark\u2019s bed was sudden enough that every eye\nin the room turned to him automatically. Ignoring their gazes, but\nturning almost as red as the suit he still wore under his unzipped\nhoodie, Peter crawled carefully onto the bed and then slowly lowered\nhimself on top of Stark before wrapping his arms and legs over him.\nBruce and he had to turn their faces to opposite sides to avoid\nbumping noses \u2013 or something more embarrassing \u2013 but neither of\nthem said a word about it. And, miraculously, neither did anybody\nelse. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThis\nisn\u2019t working,\u201d Peter said into the silence, almost an hour\nlater. He sounded almost <i>angry</i>.\n\u201cDoctor Banner\u2026 his heartbeat.. I\u2026\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\nknow, kid, I know,\u201d Bruce said, heavily. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s\u2026\nthere\u2019s gotta be <i>something</i>.\nI mean\u2026 I mean surely\u2026 F.R.I.D.A.Y, scan him. Search\u2026 search\nother ways to\u2026 to help with pain. We have to\u2026\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>Bruce\nlet go of Stark with one hand and placed it on Peter\u2019s back. His\nface was still turned away from Clint\u2019s corner of the room, so he\nsaw no expression. But there was no missing the stiffness of Parker\u2019s\nspine. How close was it to midnight? He was supposed to leave the\nnext day, early in the morning. Supposed to go back to his wife and\nkids. But Clint hadn\u2019t been able to leave the <i>room </i>for\nhours. If Stark was still trapped in medical agony when his ride\ncame\u2026 Clint was almost positive he knew that he\u2019d be staying put.\n\n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cDoctor\nStrange and Agent Romanov have returned,\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y blurted, and\nClint felt his heart lurch in hope. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Those\noutside the doorway and just within it all flattened themselves\nagainst the walls \u2013 and there was something you didn\u2019t see every\nday; Captain America and the White Wolf trying to make themselves\nsmall \u2013 and Strange strode in, magic already on his fingers. But\ninstead of going straight to Stark he began drawing a pattern on the\nfloor. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIs\nhe seriously doing a pentagram?\u201d Wanda asked, shocked into\nincredulity. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d\nStrange said, simply, while Peter finally gave in to curiosity and\ntwisted to look, doing an awkward pretzel on top of Stark to manage\nit. \u201cSame principle, though. Sort of.\u201d Design complete, he turned\nto the Stark-sandwich on the bed. \u201cWe have to get him inside this.\nBut he has to be concious, and he has to be standing alone.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201c<i>Standing</i>?\u201d\nRocket barked. \u201cDude, I don\u2019t know how hard your cloak banged you\ninto a building, but \u2013 \u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHe\nhas to be able to make a line with his body, or this won\u2019t work,\u201d\nthe sorcerer snapped back, making only a little bit of sense. \n</p><p><br></p><p>He\nleft his magic circle and made it to Stark\u2019s bedside, making Peter\nwithdraw and Bruce look politely away as he began trying to wake the\nman. When traditional methods didn\u2019t work, he sighed and began\nmassaging at Stark\u2019s chest. Clint winced a little, remembering the\ngenius\u2019 reaction to the touch earlier. But even that didn\u2019t seem\nto be rousing the man and Clint\u2019s worry began to sink deeper. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t\nthat\u2026 I mean\u2026 doesn\u2019t it hurt?\u201d It was only because Clint was\nso close that he heard Parker\u2019s very soft question. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNo,\nactually, this is helping regulate his heartbeat a little.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNo\u2026\nI\u2026 uh\u2026 I mean\u2026 <i>you</i>.\nIsn\u2019t it\u2026?\u201d Parker went red, eyes sliding very obviously away\nfrom Strange\u2019s scarred hands. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Strange\nlet out an almost-laugh. \u201cLike hell,\u201d he admitted, voice even\nquieter than Parker\u2019s. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Clint\nsaw Parker lick his lips. \u201cThen\u2026 could you\u2026 teach me? So I can,\ninstead?\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>It\nwas one of the most bizarre sights Clint had ever witnessed \u2013 the\ncounterpart of the Hulk acting as a bottom body pillow to an\nunconscious, sweaty, wheezing Stark while the Sorcerer Supreme talked\nSpider-Man, who was still mostly lying <i>on </i>Stark,\nthrough massaging the genius\u2019 chest correctly. When Peter got the\nhang of it, Strange asked Bruce where he kept a certain drug and then\ncarefully fed it into the IV line. Stark started stirring not long\nafter that. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cPete?\u201d\nhe whispered, sounding confused. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHi,\nMr Stark.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>Clint\nwanted, suddenly, to tell Parker to stop touching Stark\u2019s chest. He\ndidn\u2019t want to have to see the hurt he <i>knew </i>would\nflash all through the kid when Stark reacted violently to Parker\u2019s\nmassaging. But Stark\u2019s eyes roved over Parker, and what his hands\nwere doing, and then they rolled drunkenly, not quite tracking, to\nStrange without so much as an increase in his breathing. The noise he\nlet out was nowhere near any language Clint had ever heard, but\nStrange seemed to half-understand enough to reply. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWe\nknow how to make it stop. We just have to get you into that circle,\nthere.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>Strange\nmotioned Peter to get off, and the kid reluctantly agreed, slipping\nright to the end of the bed until Strange and Bruce started helping\nStark into a seated position \u2013 then he shimmied forward, again, and\npulled one of Stark\u2019s arms over his shoulders while Bruce\ndisconnected the IV line. Single-handedly, Parker managed to heave \nStark off the bed and keep him on his feet, a sight that would have\nbeen comical under any other circumstance. Banner took Stark\u2019s\nother side and they began carrying Stark \u2013 there was no other word\nfor it; the man\u2019s feet weren\u2019t even lifting, his head was lolling\nonto Parker\u2019s shoulder, his entire body slumped bonelessly \u2013 to\nthe magical mark on the floor Strange stood in front of. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cStark\u2026\nit will only take a moment, but you need to be standing for it.\u201d\nStark didn\u2019t react. \u201cTony. <i>Tony</i>.\u201d\n\n</p><p><br></p><p>Stark\nopened his eyes and managed to fix a wavering, dull-eyed glance on\nStrange. Slowly, with such painful precision that it chewed apart\nClint\u2019s gut, Stark pulled his arm from Bruce\u2019s shoulders. He\nalmost toppled right over, only Parker\u2019s quick reflexes keeping him\non his feet, mostly flopped over like the doll Lila used to hang over\nher arm. The sight was sickening in its wrongness. And it only got\nworse \u2013 no matter how much Stark tried to get his knees to lock,\nthey simply wouldn\u2019t. Three minutes of obvious struggling only\nresulted in him gasping for breath and slumping almost entirely\nagainst a completely freaked-out looking Parker. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat\nif he kneels?\u201d Bucky asked, suddenly. Clint tried to pretend he\ndidn\u2019t see how violently Bucky\u2019s voice made Stark <i>flinch</i>.\n\u201cThat will still make a line with his body, right?\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>Strange\nmulled it over. \u201cIt\u2026 could work.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cDude,\u201d\nQuill said, quietly, \u201cit\u2019s the best you\u2019re gonna get. And even\nthat\u2019s gonna be a cost.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>Bruce\nmoved back to Stark\u2019s side, and he and Parker helped the trembling\nman into the circle, lowering him to his hands and knees before they\nlet him go and backed away. Stark was exhaling whines of pain, again\n\u2013 no sensory input meant he was feeling it <i>all</i>.\nA particularly guttural moan had Bruce putting a hand on Peter\u2019s\nshoulder to hold the kid in place \u2013 he looked as though he was\nabout to either bolt to Stark\u2019s side or out the door. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\nneed you up straight,\u201d Strange said, very quietly, almost gently.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t take long.\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>With\nmomentous effort, Stark pushed himself onto his knees, weaving\ndrunkenly the whole way and swaying like he was at a concert once he\nwas mostly upright. His face was completely devoid of colour except\nfor the fever-red splotches, and he wasn\u2019t even bothering to try\nand keep his eyes open. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201c<i>Please</i>,\u201d\nwas all he whispered. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Strange\nchanted so fast the words seemed to be a blur, making motions from\nStark\u2019s face to the ground and back up again. The circle glowed,\nStark\u2019s thigh glowed in response and then the glow rose out of him,\nand Strange caught it and pulled it into pieces in the air. The\nglowing stopped and Stark folded like a puppet with cut strings. <i>(\u201cI\ngot no strings to hold me down\u2026\u201d Whispered gleefully in some part\nof Clint\u2019s mind</i>.<i>)\n</i>Bruce, Strange and Parker all\ndarted forward at once. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201c<i>Hell</i>,\u201d\nStark groaned. \u201c\u2019s\u2026 gone. \u2018S\u2026 f\u2019ly\u2026 gone\u2026\u201d \n</p><p><br></p><p>Parker\nlaughed, high and shaky, and the two doctors started attending to\ntheir patient, and just like that it was all over. Crisis averted.\nEverybody could go to bed with relief thrumming in their veins,\nlooking forward to the next day with nothing hanging over their\nheads. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Except\u2026\nthose things never really over when they ended, were they? Clint knew\nthis with a long-aquainted certainty, and he knew he wasn\u2019t the\nonly one on the team who did. But they never seemed to <i>really\n</i>acknowledge that fact. And he\nwas starting to think that maybe they should \u2013 that maybe it wasn\u2019t\nonly Stark who kept the wounds festering, and that maybe even Stark\ndidn\u2019t do it as willingly as Clint had always flippantly dismissed.\n\n</p><p><br></p><p>Sometime\nnear the crack of dawn, once Clint had finished packing, he returned\nquietly to the medbay. Pepper had gotten in sometime near three AM,\nand she was seated on the bed beside Stark, his head in her lap.\nCurled up against Stark, like he\u2019d been since they\u2019d put Stark\nback on the bed despite gentle reminders that it was over and that\nStark didn\u2019t have to be held any more, lay Parker, dead to the\nworld. Pepper had one hand on his head while the other played with\nStark\u2019s hair, gently, rhythmically. \n</p><p><br></p><p>There\nwas a look on her face that he\u2019d seen on Laura\u2019s so often that it\ncut Clint straight to the core, burning-agony in its bitter-sweet\nmixing of love and pain. \n</p>",

There was\ncertainly no looming figure or spaceship or giant robot promising\ndoom and destruction as the code-red call had insinuated. In fact,\nthe more they awkwardly stood in a line just off the ramp of the\nQuinjet and watched the traffic try to be more ridiculous than ever,\nthe more Clint began to suspect it was all a prank. Possibly aimed\ndirectly at him. Why else would the call to assemble to save the city\n(<i>again</i>. Damnit, New\nYork) come the <i>day </i>before\nClint was scheduled to have his quiet exit from the team so he could\nreturn to Laura and the kids?</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>He&rsquo;d\nunderstood why the whole team &ndash; including the We Just Helped Out\nThis One Time crew &ndash; had been asked to stay at the New\nAvengers Facility and be as\nvisible as possible in the days following the return of half the\nuniverse. The Snap, as the media had dubbed it, had been a traumatic\ntime for all, and having the world able to see the heroes they\ndepended on all in one, easily-accessable training facility\ndid a lot to help settle a skittish,traumatised Earth back into\nrhythm again. Clint had also understood why, when the almost\nlaughably large team had slowly been whittled down &ndash; person by\nperson so the public didn&rsquo;t panic; like weaning somebody off\ncaffeine slowly to show them that, look, you can still survive if\nyou&rsquo;re one cup a day fewer &ndash; to the minimal number of &lsquo;regulars&rsquo;,\nhe was one of the last on the list of scheduled exits. He whined\nabout it a little, of course, but he was smart enough to know that\nactual kings who had countries to run, Sorcerer Supremes,\nthunder-gods, still-mostly-broken\nandroids,\nnot-really-an-official-Avenger teenagers with finals to study for and\nwrite and people with a job in the US army should <i>rightfully</i>\nhave been excused before he was. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>He\nwas also just a little unsure of why Banner, who had freely admitted\nhe was going to stay at the Facility\nwhether he was off the official lineup or not, had <i>still\n</i>got excused before him. And also\nwhy the attempt to retain the most human-seeming members until last\nhad meant that the WWE-wrestler with no filter had been given leave,\nbut the smart-mouthed raccoon had been cajoled to stay. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well,\nsome people need time to do the villainous destructive thingies,&rdquo;\nRocket said, as though reading Clint&rsquo;s mental assessment of him and\nwillingly jumping in to prove his point. &ldquo;Not everybody can level a\ncity with a <i>snap of his fingers</i>.&rdquo;\n\n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>A\nvisible wince flowed through the group like a ripple. &ldquo;Dude,&rdquo;\nQuill groaned, as Rocket snorted and muttered about it being a good\njoke. &ldquo;Too soon.&rdquo;</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo;\nSam piped in, falsely cheerfully, &ldquo;but only, like, three decades\ntoo soon, so we&rsquo;re all good.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No\nneed for Stark to give away his Inappropriate Asshole Remarks award\njust yet,&rdquo; Clint chimed in, because he&rsquo;d forgotten, for just a\nmoment, that whatever tight-knit camaraderie existed while you saved\nthe universe together faded after the first few giddy days of\nrelief-trauma. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>Clint\ngrimaced at the quickly-thickening silence that followed his remark.\nA few years ago, Stark would have filled the silence with rapid-fire\ncomebacks of his own, or somebody else would have picked up the\nribbing, and they would have gone into battle snarking and saving\neach other in equal measure. But Stark had not had the job or life\nClint had &ndash; the dual\ncombination that had taught\nhim to let some things that had happened be bygones so that everybody\ncould move on and deal with who they were and what they were doing in\n<i>that </i>moment. Stark\nseemed to put the bandaid on the wound not only to stop the bleeding,\nbut to stop anybody taking whatever was buried under his skin causing\nthe pain out of him, so he could hold it there and <i>feel </i>it\nfor forever. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We\nshould split up and look for signs of disturbance,&rdquo; Steve said in a\nlevel voice, opting to pretend the awkwardness was not near-choking.\n&ldquo;Star-Lord, you and Rocket go the length of the Hudson and head\ninland. Falcon, Black Widow &ndash; you two work areal and ground from\nthe Civic Centre and work your way in. Iron Man and Hawkeye, same but\nfrom the East River in. Bucky and I will go from Washington Heights\ndown. Rendezvous point is Central Park; keep in contact over the\ncoms.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What\npart of Central Park?&rdquo; Sam asked, probably just to be otherwise. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;The\ncentral part of it,&rdquo; Steve deadpanned back as Natasha smirked.\n&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>Stark&rsquo;s\nfaceplate was down by the time Clint glanced at him, and so all he\ngot was a view of flat, angry gold. Without a word, Stark fired his\nrepulsors and swooped at Clint, who was only not caught completely\noff guard because of how often he&rsquo;d been Stark-lifted in the past.\nAs he was jerked into the air, still in complete silence, he couldn&rsquo;t\nhelp but warily think back to their very first battle together.\n<i>Better clench up, Legolas</i>.\nAs annoying as Stark&rsquo;s babbling and needling could be, the silence\nfrom the man was&hellip; unnerving. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Going\ndown,&rdquo; Stark said, suddenly, and a moment later Clint found himself\nbeing dropped, rather roughly, onto a rooftop. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>He\nstumbled and staggered a little, but managed to stick the landing,\nbiting down on his tongue to stop himself from lashing out at Stark\nfor the obviously intentional hard drop. Stark still acted like a\npetty child, and it irked Clint to no end. Muttering to himself, he\nstarted surveying their area, making his own way over rooftops so\nthat he didn&rsquo;t have to rely on Stark again. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Anything?&rdquo;\nStark asked a while later, out of sight in the skies somewhere. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\nsee two teenagers who <i>really shouldn&rsquo;t be doing that</i>,&rdquo;\nClint said, raising his voice so that the duo heard him, jumped, and\nthen scampered away guiltily. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Saving\nthe world one unplanned pregnancy at a time,&rdquo; Tony said dryly. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve\nheard &lsquo;friendly neighbourhood hero&rsquo; is the in thing, this year,&rdquo;\nClint fired back, eyes roving over the latest street he hovered over.\n\n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;The\nyellow butterfly headed toward you as you ask, &lsquo;is this the way I\nbecome cool and relevant again?&rsquo; is labelled &lsquo;copying a literal\nteenager&rsquo;.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>Clint\nblinked, hard, his train of thought suddenly crashing to a halt.\n&ldquo;Wait, <i>what</i>?&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Guys,\nI think we found what we were called in to fight.&rdquo; Quill&rsquo;s voice\nsounded grimly bemused through the com-link. &ldquo;And they&rsquo;ve been at\nit for a while, looks like.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They&rsquo;,\nas in, multiple hostiles?&rdquo; Steve demanded. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That\ndepends,&rdquo; Quill replied. &ldquo;Are you calling the magical, sentient\nvines the enemy, or the being making them appear?&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;The\nvines are <i>sentient</i>?&rdquo;\nSam sounded a little out of breath. &ldquo;How do we know this?&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Guessed,&rdquo;\nRocket replied, &ldquo;&rsquo;cause deciding the vines can hit for themselves\nand being proved you were an idiot is a lot less stupid than the\nother way.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\nsay we agree with the guy who has a tree as a best friend,&rdquo; Bucky\npiped up, mildly. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Where\nare you two?&rdquo; Steve asked, and Clint caught sight of Stark heading\nhis way, ready, no doubt, to pick Clint up and take him to the battle\nscene. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hiding\nbehind a building,&rdquo; Rocket said. &ldquo;Watching the vine-making-person\nmake vines and destroy stuff with them.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Where\n</i>is this building?&rdquo; Steve\nclarified. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;In\nbetween another two. There&rsquo;s a Starbucks on the corner,&rdquo; Rocket\nsaid, helpfully. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nnear the river?&rdquo; Quill added. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Riverside\nBoulevard, Lincoln Square, New York,&rdquo; F.R.I.D.A.Y&rsquo;s voice chimed\nin before anybody could start to get too exasperated. &ldquo;Head for the\nopen patch of green just off the Joe DiMaggio Highway.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Ah,\ncrap; it <i>had </i>to be\nnear the highway,&rdquo; Sam sighed. &ldquo;Those kinds of battles <i>always\n</i>end up messy.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Star-Lord,\nRocket &ndash; wait until you have backup to engage. First on the scene,\ntry and contain the threat before it reaches the highway,&rdquo; Steve\nordered. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>Once\nagain, Clint got almost no warning before Stark grabbed him and\nlifted him, somewhat painfully, into the sky. This time, the silence\nwas calculating instead of awkward; Clint was sure Stark was having\nconversations with his AI as he flew, and he himself needed the time\nto get his head around the idea of <i>sentient vines</i>.\nIt didn&rsquo;t take much searching to find them; they were a sickly\nyellow-green, as thick as a manhole at their smallest and already\ncausing some destruction to buildings and roads along the boulevard.\nAnd some of them had started climbing their way up the supports of\nthe highway. There was little, Clint realised, that a bow and arrow\ncould do against them, even if the arrow exploded. So his job would\nthen be Team Two: Take Out The Mad Creator. For that, he had to find\nsaid person who, according to Quill and Rocket, had given them the\nshake when they realised they were being watched. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Iron\nMan, drop me on the tallest roof around here so I can find this guy\nand take him down.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>Steve\nimmediately sorted the rest of the team into the two groups, guessing\nat Clint&rsquo;s intentions &ndash; Natasha and Sam were with him, while the\nrest of the team got to blow up some plants. Stark obeyed his request\nbut, once again, did so harshly, leaving Clint to skid and swear\nunder his breath at the sharp pain of impact. He turned to glare at\nthe man, but Stark was already gone. So, instead, Clint called him a\nfew choice names in his head and then set about finding his target. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo;\nStark panted. &ldquo;These things are more vicious than a pissed-off\nchihuahua.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;At\nleast they don&rsquo;t grow back rapidly when you tear them in pieces,&rdquo;\nNatasha said, mildly. &ldquo;Or spray awful things at you. Plus, they\ndon&rsquo;t seem to be truly sentient &ndash; just alive enough to have a\npurpose.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;How&hellip;motivating&hellip;&rdquo;\nStark bit back, sounding completely out of breath. &ldquo;Hey, Black\nWidow &ndash;&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t\nyou <i>dare </i>say you&rsquo;re\nbringing the party to us.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;This\nis why&hellip;I never&hellip; invite you&hellip;anywhere fun,&rdquo; Stark panted. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>The\ntalk over the com-link reduced itself to sudden, loud exclamations of\npain or frustration and the occasional directive or query. It didn&rsquo;t\ntake too long for them to track down their villain of the week, but\nfinding them and being able to stop them from creating new vines or\nusing the ones already created to give the team a rather good\nthrashing turned out to be two completely different ballgames.\nClint&rsquo;s aim was as true as ever, but none of his arrows seemed to\nhave any effect on the vaguely humanoid being that swatted their\nattempts to reach them aside like annoying flies before continuing to\n<i>sing </i>vines from the\nearth. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>Eventually,\nNatasha managed to get close enough to ram one of her Bites onto the\nhostile&rsquo;s neck. They threw her off in a blast of pale-yellow light,\nbut still went down to their knees, twitching under the force of the\nweapon. Clint fired a taser arrow at the being just as they looked\nlike they were about to get to their feet, saw Natasha trying to\nfight her way out of the thick vines wrapping around her, saw Sam,\nwings thrown off, start to run toward their newly felled enemy in an\nattempt to reach them before Clint&rsquo;s arrow&rsquo;s effect wore off.\nClint knew that neither he nor Sam would reach their target in time &ndash;\nthe hostile was too well protected against their attacks. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Need\nsome help!&rdquo; Sam yelled over the com, running as fast as he could\ndespite the probable futility. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;On\nit,&rdquo; Stark&rsquo;s voice answered back, and a moment later the Iron Man\nsuit dropped like a stone from the sky, hurtling toward their\ntwitching, struggling enemy. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>Clint\nsaw Sam falter for a few steps at the sight, a mask of horror and\nfamiliarity flashing across his face before he pulled himself into\nthe <i>now </i>and continued\nrunning. Clint, too, continued his rush to reach them, half an eye on\nNat and half an eye on Stark who <i>wasn&rsquo;t pulling up. </i>Ten\nfeet from the ground, Clint opened his mouth to yell &ndash; what, he\nnever would have been able to say, but his heart was in his throat at\nthe sight of Stark not stopping &ndash; and, almost at the same time, the\nBleeding Edge &nbsp;armour peeled away from its creator, dropping to the\nfloor faster than even he was falling like one of those fake\nslime-in-a-tubs his kids played with and creating a sort of\nfunnel-cushion that not only caught Stark as he fell but acted as a\nsort of slide, gently depositing him on his one knee and one hand\njust in front of their slowly-rising enemy. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>And,\nokay, Clint could admit it &ndash; that had been a pretty damn awesome\nmove. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>Stark\ngot to his feet, and fashioned crude restraints out of some of his\narmour. He&rsquo;d managed to lock down three of their enemy&rsquo;s four\nlimbs before the hostile, until that point still but for the twitches\nfrom the electricity, reared up and slammed their free hand to an\nunprotected area around Stark&rsquo;s thigh. The accompanying blast of\nlight was much brighter yellow than the one that had swatted Nat\naway, and Stark was blown backwards with a curse of surprise that was\nloud in the otherwise silence of the attack. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>Clint\ndidn&rsquo;t stop to see where or how Stark landed. He and Sam reached\ntheir enemy at about the same time and, with Stark&rsquo;s armour holding\nmost of the being in place, they made quick teamwork of finally\nknocking their target unconscious. As they slumped to the ground,\nClint drew one last taser arrow and embedded it into the inert form.\nHe wasn&rsquo;t taking any chances. While the electroshocks worked their\nway through their enemy and Sam readied the restraints, Clint glanced\nup to take stock of the team. Steve and Bucky were quickly picking\ntheir way around still-vicious vines, Rocket was laughing his ass off\nat Quill trying to flail out from under a miniature vine that had\nseemingly snuck up on him and Natasha was half-bent over Stark,\nbleeding slightly but steady, as Stark got carefully to his feet. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Containment\nvehicle and medical are both on their way. Vines are giving them a\nbit of trouble,&rdquo; Steve reported as they all regrouped around their\nunconscious and thoroughly restrained enemy. There wasn&rsquo;t much to\nreply to that, so everybody just stood, getting their breath back and\nidly watching Stark retrieve his nanobots now that they were no\nlonger needed as restraints, coaxing them back around his body until\nthe armour was once again complete. &ldquo;I want everybody to be\nthoroughly cleared by medical before we start cleaning this mess up,&rdquo;\nSteve eventually said into the silence. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Ugh.\nWell this takes the fun out of saving the day,&rdquo; Rocket said, idly\nkicking at the tip of a vine that had been sneaking closer to him. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What\nif we just&hellip; leave them?&rdquo; Quill suggested. &ldquo;I mean, weren&rsquo;t\npeople going on about making New York more&hellip; ecofriendly and\n&lsquo;green&rsquo;?&rdquo; Behind him, there was an ominous crack as one of the\nthick vines began squeezing a support column of the highway. Quill\nsighed. &ldquo;Yeah, okay, fine. <i>Fine</i>.&rdquo;\n\n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Do\nit for the vine,&rdquo; Bucky said, voice and face completely deadpan. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>Natasha\nsmirked and Sam threw his head back to look at the heavens with a\ndeep sigh. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>They\nstarted hacking down some of the vines closest to their fallen enemy\nwhile they waited for medical to crawl its way over to them, and even\nwhen the three heavily armoured and manned vans arrived they all\npersonally made sure the still-unconcious being was securely\ncontained within the vehicle and that the personnel inside were aware\nthat they could not mess up and let the tough asshole get loose. Then\nthey all shuffled off to be poked and prodded by medical &ndash; some\nmore willingly than others &ndash; and Clint got to witness the rather\namusing show of a fresh-faced medical professional try and perform an\nexamination on Rocket, who obviously didn&rsquo;t make the process of her\nfirst genetically-engineered-raccoon examination easier on her. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>Steve\nhovered around Bucky, mostly, but then <i>casually </i>made\nhis way over to the medic who had examined Stark and had a quiet word\nwith them, obviously trusting Stark&rsquo;s past history with skipping\nmedical exams over the man&rsquo;s declaration that he was in the clear.\nAnd then, as medical trundled away &ndash; without giving them so much as\na damn lollipop for good behaviour, let alone the good dose of carbs\nthey were all probably craving &ndash; the Avengers got to work with city\ncleanup, which, despite the difficulty of hacking apart vines as\nthick as tree trunks that wanted to kill you, was still accompanied\nby memes, bad jokes about Jack and the Beanstalk and the inevitable\nfarming/harvesting cracks thrown Clint&rsquo;s way. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>As\nalways, the Avengers worked best as a team, each member carrying a\nspecific part of the physical and emotional labour of the task that\nbettered the effort as a whole. But Stark&rsquo;s repulsors were clearly\nthe winning methods of vine-destruction, managing to cleanly sever\neven the thickest vines in two or three shots where it took everybody\nelse many more. They therefore quickly and wordlessly broke into a\nproduction line &ndash; Rocket, Quill and Stark cut the vines up, and the\nrest joined with the Department of Damage Control crew to peel the\nmostly-dead plants from the infrastructure or haul the pieces into\nthe Department of Damage Control-issued containers that had arrived\nwith said crew about thirty minutes after the battle ended. The extra\nhelp, though a little star-struck in cases, was highly appreciated\nand made the going delightfully faster than Clint&rsquo;s tired and\nfrankly sore body and mind had predicted. So much so, in fact, that\nit began to look like they&rsquo;d probably be able to do most of the\ncleanup in one day <i>and </i>before\ndarkness truly fell. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>At\nfirst, Clint didn&rsquo;t notice that a bottleneck in the production line\nhad formed &ndash; he was focussed on pulling a truly <i>stubborn\n</i>monster of a vine off a\ntelephone pole, and wasn&rsquo;t paying much attention to his surrounds.\nWhen he finally managed to peel the sucker off, there were about\nthree eager D.O.D.C personnel who rushed forward to take it off his\nhands when he waved it vaguely in the air. One glance around showed\nhim that it was not just because they were fans of his &ndash; there were\npeople in D.O.D.C uniforms awkwardly loitering around every Avenger,\nand even his team members were standing around, hands empty, glancing\nat one another to figure out what was going on. It wasn&rsquo;t a\ndifficult mystery to solve, really: the rest of the line didn&rsquo;t\nhave much to do, because the cutting crew was cutting the vines up\ntoo slowly for the rest of them, giving a lack of things to peel or\ncarry. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re\ngoing as fast as we can,&rdquo; Quill said through gritted teeth when\ncautiously asked about it, and Clint could see the evidence in his\nstatement in the way they worked, throwing themselves and their\nweapons at every hard-to-cut-through, determined-to-advance,\nprone-to-fight-back-viciously vine. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>Or,\nin the way Quill and Rocket worked, in any case. Stark, on the other\nhand&hellip; Was he <i>seriously </i>just\nleaning against some half-crushed car, casually watching Quill and\nRocket work? Clint raised an eyebrow and threw a glance over at Steve\nwho, sure as anything, was doing the Eyebrow Thing at the side of\nStark&rsquo;s armoured head. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;St\n&ndash; Iron Man,&rdquo; Steve started. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;\nStark didn&rsquo;t even turn and look at him. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>Steve&rsquo;s\nexpression grew cautious, and he took his time choosing his next\nwords, aware, just like everybody else, that there were still\ngrenades buried in the spaces between the members of the Avengers\nthat <i>hadn&rsquo;t </i>simply\ndisappeared when Thanos snapped his fingers. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re\nstill needing all hands on deck, here,&rdquo; Steve said in a measured\ntone. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re still only about halfway, and it&rsquo;s already\nbeen&hellip;&rdquo; He glanced at the nearest D.O.D.C crew member, who fumbled\nwith a watch. &ldquo;Two and a half hours,&rdquo; he finished. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;All\nthat backwards earth tec running out of juice?&rdquo; Rocket jibed,\nfiring four consecutive shots at a vine without looking, probably to\nprove he could. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Suit&rsquo;s\nfine,&rdquo; Stark said, still not moving. There was a beat and then,\nquietly, even though the suit&rsquo;s speakers, he added, &ldquo;I think&hellip;\n<i>I&rsquo;m </i>running out of\njuice.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>For\none moment, Clint was thrown by the soft confession. And then he\nremembered the whining, dramatic, grumpy-sarcastic man Stark had\nbecome those few times Clint had seen him sick, in the past, and he\nsighed. This cleanup operation was about to get a whole lot longer\nand a whole lot more irritating if Stark got the man flu on them.\nEspecially because the two people who could safely deal with Stark\nwhen he was being Especially Starkish were in the Facility&rsquo;s\nscience lab and in Geneva for an S.I. conference respectively. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well,\nif we hurry up, we&rsquo;ll be done sooner,&rdquo; Nat said, steadily, gaze\ndirect as though she could find some expression to read on Stark&rsquo;s\nmask. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>For\nanother moment, Stark didn&rsquo;t move. Then, without another word, he\npushed off from the car and got back to work. Everybody else followed\nsuit, and Clint was once again able to get lost in the monotony of\nthe job until about an hour later. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Dude,\nyou just took a break, come on,&rdquo; Quill complained, loud and\nirritated enough that Clint glanced over. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>Stark\nwas, once again, leaning against an object, this time with his head\nagainst the pole as well. The last time Clint had glanced up because\nof an over-saturation of tired but still eager D.O.D.C crew crowding\naround him, he&rsquo;d seen Rocket and Quill still at work while Stark\nsat on the side of the pavement, arms hanging between his knees and\nhead bent. For a moment, a niggle of worry flared in Clint; usually,\nin the suit and in front of a crowd, Stark put on a much better show\nthan this. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Stark,&rdquo;\nSteve said, managing to sound measured. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all tired, we&rsquo;re\nall sick of this&hellip; Let&rsquo;s just keep pulling our weight so we can go\nsooner than later.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>For\nabout a full minute, there was no answer from Stark. And then, in a\nvoice that sounded unusually mechanical, he said, &ldquo;I&hellip; really\ndon&rsquo;t&hellip; feel too good. Something&rsquo;s&hellip; I think something&rsquo;s\nwrong. I&hellip; it hurts all over.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That\nwoulda worked better if you hadn&rsquo;t already been cleared by medical,\ndude,&rdquo; Quill shot back, still irritated.</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;They\nsaid you were absolutely fine &ndash; barely any bruises or\nscrapes on you, even,&rdquo;\nSteve put in. &ldquo;He told me, personally.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thank\nyou for butting into personal medical information, Captain Obvious.&rdquo;\nThis time, the dead, mechanical tone had a snarl to it. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Come\non, man,&rdquo; Sam said, sounding tired but still trying to be soothing.\n&ldquo;Just&hellip;&rdquo; He waved a hand. &ldquo;It sucks to be out here doing this,\nbut we&rsquo;re all here and at least you don&rsquo;t have alien-plant sap\nall over you that smells like your grandma&rsquo;s shoes after a hot\nday.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;The\nD.O.D.C is here &ndash; this is their job,&rdquo; Stark started, finally\nlifting his head so he could turn it to where Steve stood. &nbsp;\n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nour job, too. It always has been our job to &ndash;&rdquo; Steve didn&rsquo;t get\nto finish. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;To\nwhat, Rogers? To be <i>held accountable </i>for\nour actions? Is that what you were about to say?&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>Bucky,\nprobably subconsciously, slidled closer to Steve. The D.O.D.C humans\nall looked about one second away from panicking. Natasha met Clint&rsquo;s\neyes, and Clint gave her a small nod of understanding. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay,\nlook. This is my last day here, and I want to go home to see in\nperson that my youngest son now enjoys eating the chicken&rsquo;s crap he\nfinds in the yard. That means getting this done and getting back to\nthe coast without another episode of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>.\nSo how about I take Stark and we go and clean up that small patch of\nvines on that one skyscraper they&rsquo;re colonising to give everybody a\ngood break? Stark, I&rsquo;ll even pretend you pulled your weight whether\nyou do so or not. How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>Steve\nopened his mouth, then sighed, shut his eyes briefly, and nodded.\nStark jerked away from the lamppost, made his way over to Clint &ndash;\nlike an angry teenager in combat boots; <i>stomp, stomp, stomp</i>\n&ndash; grabbed him without a word and lifted him once more into the air.\n\n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>This\ntime, he dropped Clint so suddenly and so hard that Clint couldn&rsquo;t\nkeep his footing and ended up half-sprawling, scraping his right side\nand his knees as he tried to stop his skid across the roof before he\nfell over the other side. The spike of surprise and pain ebbed and,\nin its place, anger reared. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay,\nseriously, what the ever-loving &ndash; &rdquo; Stark was on the roof, too.\nOn his hands and knees, with the faceplate peeled away, retching\nslightly onto the roof in front of him. The anger lowered to a\nsimmer, but didn&rsquo;t completely go away. &ldquo;Stark?&rdquo; There was no\nanswer, so Clint got up and moved closer. &ldquo;Hey&hellip;&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Piss\noff,&rdquo; Stark gasped at him. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>Clint\nscowled and flipped him the bird in response, even though Stark had\nhis eyes squeezed tightly shut. &ldquo;Asshole; I&rsquo;m trying to help.\nWhat&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Nothing\n&ndash; medical cleared me, remember?&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>Clint\ngroaned out loud. &ldquo;Yeah, Stark &ndash; sullen, smart-ass teenager\nresponses to these sorts of questions always work out well for\neverybody. Keep sticking your head further up your own ass.&rdquo; Once\nagain &ndash; too many times for that day, Clint suddenly realised &ndash;\nStark remained silent, his eyes distant and slightly unfocused as he\nslowly rose to his feet. Clint couldn&rsquo;t miss the wince, even if it\ndid look like Stark tried to hide it. &ldquo;Come on, man. What does\nF.R.I.D.A.Y say, then?&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>He\nread the answer in the tense silence and the way Stark would not look\nat him &ndash; his AI, it seemed, agreed with medical in their assessment\nthat Stark was completely fine. Clint frowned at Stark&rsquo;s face and\nposture and mulled things over for a beat or two before deciding that\nwhile he wasn&rsquo;t qualified to assess what was making Stark think he\nwas not fine when everybody was telling him otherwise, he was\nqualified to know Stark shouldn&rsquo;t be around helping to make New\nYork Tarzan unfriendly once more. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>His\nprevious offer to cover for Stark had been sarcastic and aimed at\nstopping a stupid intra-team bickering session. This time, the offer\nwas crafted in complete sincerity and the desire to offer an olive\nbranch and get Stark the break he needed to figure out what was going\non with him. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you just skip out on the rest of this?\nTag somebody else in to do your part for you, instead.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>Even\nas the words left his mouth, Clint realised his fatal error in the\nway he&rsquo;d phrased things. He immediately tried to backtrack and take\naway the implications he hadn&rsquo;t meant to make, but Stark&rsquo;s head\nsnapped towards him and there was suddenly cold ice in his expression\nand in his voice when he told Clint where to go and stick it. Before\nClint could get out more than <i>I didn&rsquo;t mean</i>,\nStark&rsquo;s faceplate was once again covering his face, and he&rsquo;d\nlaunched himself into the air so he could start firing at the vines\nthey were supposed to be taking down. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>Clint\nthrew up his hands in disgust, irritated at both Stark and himself,\nand let the man go. <br /></p><hr /><p>\nThe\nboots of the Iron Man armour hit the floor of Tony&rsquo;s lab and,\ndespite the armour still encasing him, Tony immediately stumbled into\na wall and then collapsed in an undignified heap on the floor. For a\nlong moment, he could hear nothing except his own harsh, uneven\nbreathing and the ringing empty fullness of his head, throbbing\naround in meaningless circles. The only thing that stood out in the\nfog and the confusion was the pain that radiated through his entire\nbody. He&rsquo;d felt bone-deep agony, before, and this somehow went even\n<i>deeper</i>, to an\nintensity that his mind simply could not wrap itself around. It felt\nlike all the non-hurting a body usually did by default was being\n<i>pulled </i>out of him inch\nby agonising inch; a deep <i>drag </i>he\ncould subconsciously feel but not pinpoint or explain, making his\nbones and veins and very atoms howl in agony every time the tide\ninside of him went out and pulled more of the un-pain and energy out\nof him, leaving him with nothing but the opposite of un-pain\n<i>everywhere</i> in streaks\nof fire. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;-\nhave them come to the Facility at once.&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>F.R.I.D.A.Y&rsquo;s\nvoice faded in from some distant universe, and he spoke his first\nthought out loud. &ldquo;Though&rsquo; I muted&hellip;you.&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;In\nthe suit, Boss, you did. Not in the Facility.&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Any\nother time he would have been proud of her for managing to interpret\nhis slurred words, or would have been nostalgically bittersweet by\nthe way she was starting to pick up inflection in her words. JARVIS\nhad taken longer to do that, but once he&rsquo;d gotten the hang of it&hellip;\nNobody could do exasperatedly-worried like JARVIS could. But this\ntime, those observations were mere flickers on a mental screen\nusually buzzing with so many different things at once, now reduced to\nabsolute Blue Screen meltdown. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wh&rsquo;er\nyou saying?&rdquo; He&rsquo;d missed the first part of her statement, and\nthought it could be important. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nin the process of scanning you using my Facility capabilities, and\nthen I&rsquo;m sending the data to medical to &ndash; &rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Override,&rdquo;\nhe said, at once, still aware enough to know to do that. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Boss,\nyour temperature is currently 103.8 and showing no signs of slowing\ndown -&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;This&rsquo;s\nwhy I&rsquo;uted you in&rsquo;th suit,&rdquo; Tony reminded her, trying to make\nhis tone one of warning while he shut his eyes, rolled his forehead\nto the wall and unsuccessfully tried to swallow a low whine of pain. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;And\nI still cannot detect the reason for it,&rdquo; F.R.I.D.A.Y finished, not\nat all cowed. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;zactly,\nFri,&rdquo; Tony panted, fingers unknowingly scrabbling against the wall\nand floor as he sought a purchase he could not grasp in the waves of\npain. &ldquo;Medical&hellip; checked. You&hellip; checked. Nothing&hellip; wron-&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>He\nwas too far awash in the pain to register that he was making loud,\nunrestrained howl-moans of pain, or that he was near-writhing against\nthe wall. Instinctively, he curled in on himself, clutching as hard\nas he could. And, miraculously, his touch helped cut off the pain. As\nthe after-effects receded, he dimly heard F.R.I.D.A.Y talking to him\nagain. Probably the same thing she&rsquo;d been warning him about for\nhours: his body was trying to fight off some illness that didn&rsquo;t\nexist. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Hell,\nhe was so tired. And, apparently, not breathing right, he realised a\nfuzzy moment or several later, rectifying this by taking in a deep\nbreath that sounded like a death rattle. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Boss,\n<i>please</i>.&rdquo; He&rsquo;d\nnever heard his AI beg before. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Not&hellip;\nwasting people&rsquo;s&hellip; time&hellip; with&hellip; nothing&hellip;&rdquo; Tony ground out\nat her, gripping himself tighter as an instinctive experiment, and\nlaughing slightly breathlessly when the hard pressure on his limbs\nnumbed the pain. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;This\nis <i>not </i>nothing,&rdquo;\nF.R.I.D.A.Y insisted, and then continued with words Tony didn&rsquo;t\nbother to listen to because his exhausted, burning, pain-overided\nmind was trying to latch on to the blessed relief he&rsquo;d just\naccidentally discovered. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Pressure\nstopped the pain. He could almost stand to exist in his skin, again,\nnow that he was gripping himself as hard as he could. But&hellip; <i>but</i>.\nHis grip was fever-weak. And he could only put pressure on certain\npoints. The energy-sapping pulls of agony still happened in the parts\nof his body he was currently unable to hug, and he could feel his\nability to keep a tight hold on himself slipping. He was shaking too\nhard to keep it up for long. He needed something that would put\npressure <i>everywhere</i>.\nHe needed something <i>heavy</i>\n&ndash; stronger than he could grip. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Couch.\nThere was a couch in his lab. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Getting\nto it would mean he&rsquo;d have to uncurl himself. That would mean\nagony. And&hellip; he didn&rsquo;t know if he could reach it. F.R.I.D.A.Y\ncontrolling the armour had been the only thing that had gotten him in\nthe air after Steve called the end of cleanup, let alone back to the\nFacility and safely through the entry hatch into his lab. And&hellip; oh.\nThe armour was currently not around him, any more. When had it\nreceded? Had he done that? \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Wave\nof agony to get him back on track. Couch. Right. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Couldn&rsquo;t\nget there. Wasn&rsquo;t strong enough. Had to get the couch to him. How?\nWho could he possibly call? The rest of the team was probably still\non their way over on the Quinjet. And they all knew nothing was wrong\nwith him. Couldn&rsquo;t call Bruce, either. Bruce was a doctor. Ish.\nHe&rsquo;d know there was nothing wrong with Tony, too, and his gentle\nindulging Tony sarcastically would drive Tony up the wall when it was\nbeing done while the agony -</p><p><br /></p><p>-hit\nin a wave like it just did. Couch. He had to get the couch over to\nhim. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Armour.\nThe armour was strong enough to do so. He had an old model in the lab\nfor (security, always security, just in case) aesthetic nostalgia.\nF.R.I.D.A.Y could pilot it. Could use it to drop the couch on him. He\nthought he ordered her to do so, but there was silence in the lab for\nso long that he started to think he&rsquo;d only <i>thought </i>of\ntelling her and hadn&rsquo;t actually made the words come out. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>And\nthen, slowly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m choosing to ignore that request, Boss, because\nit measures in the realm of delirium and conflicts with my primary\nobjective.&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;F.R.I.D.A.Y&hellip;\njust&hellip; get the armour&hellip;&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Boss,\nI cannot -&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Override&hellip;\ncode&hellip;&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Boss,\nI implore you not to -&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Override&hellip;\ncode&hellip;&rdquo; <br /></p><hr /><p>\n&ldquo;Hey, Bruce?&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>\nBruce looked up curiously from whatever he was reading at Clint&rsquo;s\nvoice. &nbsp;&ldquo;You guys are back,&rdquo; he said, sounding relieved. &ldquo;That\nwas a long one.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>\n&ldquo;Cleanup sucked,&rdquo; Clint said, succinctly. &ldquo;More on the news at\neight.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>\nBruce grinned. &ldquo;Already got all the cool footage from Twitter,&rdquo;\nhe said, sounding a little smug. Then he took off his glasses and\nsaid, more seriously, &ldquo;What can I help you with?&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>\n&ldquo;Got a scrape I think is full of stuff that I can&rsquo;t reach myself\nthat I got after medical had already checked us and left,&rdquo; Clint\nsaid evenly, hoping Bruce wouldn&rsquo;t ask how he got it so he didn&rsquo;t\nhave to choose whether to lie or to rat out Stark to one of his\nclosest friends and put Banner in the middle. Again. &ldquo;Could use\nsome help.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>\nBruce winced in sympathy and stood immediately, gesturing Clint\ntoward the small but efficient medbay. &ldquo;Sure, of course.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>\nBut when they neared the room, there was a blinking light on one of\nthe walls that made Clint frown. &ldquo;Hey, isn&rsquo;t that an alert from\nF.R.I.D.A.Y?&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>\nStark hadn&rsquo;t put her all over the old compound as he had in the\ntower, but she was inserted in certain key rooms, of which the medbay\nwas one. The light meant she&rsquo;d tried to reach somebody, hadn&rsquo;t\nfound them, and had left a message. Bruce picked up the pace\nsomewhat, opened the door, and called the AI&rsquo;s name in question. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>\n&ldquo;Doctor Banner, your presence is needed in Mr Stark&rsquo;s lab\nimmediately,&rdquo; F.R.I.D.A.Y rattled, so fast the words were nearly\nonly a blur of sound. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>\nFor a moment, it threw both men. And then Bruce was whirling on his\nheel and half jogging to Stark&rsquo;s lab and Clint was following,\ndespite the pace pulling on his fresh scrapes and bruises, because\nsomething in his gut was telling him that something was very, very\nwrong. Bruce keyed in his access code to the lab, hauled open the\ndoor, and immediately breathed something in a language Clint didn&rsquo;t\nunderstand. He got the gist, though, and a moment later he added an\nEnglish equivalent when he saw Stark starfished on the ground with a\nlarge sofa pinning everything from his neck down. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>\n&ldquo;F.R.I.D.A.Y, what happened?&rdquo; Bruce asked as they both rushed to\nStark&rsquo;s side and, without needing to ask the other for assistance,\nhauled the sofa off of him. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>\n&ldquo;Boss used an override code to make me pilot the old armour to drop\nthe couch on him,&rdquo; F.R.I.D.A.Y said, her voice flatter and more\nmechanical than Clint had ever heard it. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>\n&ldquo;What? Why the <i>hell </i>did he do that?&rdquo; Clint asked,\nincredulously staring at the seemingly unconscious genius while Bruce\nknelt at his side and started poking and prodding at him. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>\n&ldquo;Boss wasn&rsquo;t&hellip; he wasn&rsquo;t being very coherent at the time, but\nhe said something about the pressure helping to ease the pain.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>\n&ldquo;What &ndash; &rdquo; Clint started, but Bruce beat him to a question, his\nvoice authoritative and clipped. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>\n&ldquo;F.R.I.D.A.Y, what&rsquo;s his temp?&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>\n&ldquo;Currently 104.3, Doctor Banner.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>\n&ldquo;Cause?&rdquo; Bruce fired out as Clint swore again, a swoop of concern\nand deep, aching guilt beginning to turn his stomach. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>\n&ldquo;None found.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>\nBruce jerked a little in shock, his hands all over Stark&rsquo;s neck and\nforehead. &ldquo;What do you mean, there&rsquo;s no cause?&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>\n&ldquo;Medical scans at the scene of the battle, and subsequent scans\ndone by the suit and the equipment present in this room have revealed\nthat there is no cause for Mr Stark to have a fever. There is no sign\nof any pathogens or infections, and the only other physical wounds\nare minor bruising and abrasions and the three broken ribs that\noccurred due to the impact of the sofa.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>\nClint realised, sort of numbly, that F.R.I.D.A.Y&rsquo;s suddenly\nmonotonous speech pattern sounded awfully like some S.H.E.I.L.D\nagents he knew when they were both panicked and trying not to be, and\novercome with guilt. He pushed the thought away and focused on Bruce\nand a pale, unresponsive, sweaty Stark. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>\n&ldquo;We <i>need </i>to stop this fever, but I can&rsquo;t risk giving him\nanything if we don&rsquo;t know what this <i>is</i>,&rdquo; Bruce muttered,\nsounding frustrated. &ldquo;And this place <i>doesn&rsquo;t have baths</i>.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>\n&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the water fixture out back?&rdquo; Clint put in, helpfully. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>\nBruce nodded sharply, once. &ldquo;F.R.I.D.A.Y, is anybody close to one\nof your speakers?&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>\n&ldquo;Not at present, Doctor, no.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>\n&ldquo;Clint, text somebody, then. Tell them to pour boiling water into\nthe fountain &ndash; I need it lukewarm. And <i>fast</i>. Then help me\nlift him.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>\nClint did as Bruce asked without a word, fingers flying over a text\nto Nat, using codewords so she knew he was being <i>serious</i>.\nBruce continued to converse with F.R.I.D.A.Y over symptoms and\nhappenings, but the story remained the same: Tony&rsquo;s body was frying\nitself, and nobody knew why. Helpfully, Clint&rsquo;s brain chose to\nremind him of all the early warning signs from earlier that day: how\nStark had been visibly flagging. How Stark had <i>told </i>them\nsomething was wrong. How he&rsquo;d seen Stark on his hands and knees,\nretching and clearly not okay, and hadn&rsquo;t told anybody because\nStark was a damn big idiot, and, apparently, Clint was one, too. He&rsquo;d\nmessed up, he knew. And big time. Never <i>mind </i>that medical had\ncleared him &ndash; Clint should have known better. And <i>done </i>better.\n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>\nBruce grabbed Tony&rsquo;s torso, and Clint grabbed his legs, and\ntogether they began the arduous task of hauling Stark to the back\nentrance of the Facility, where a gaudy water fixture that was\napparently an in-joke between Rhodes and Stark stood. Stark didn&rsquo;t\nso much as twitch once, and the lack of animation in the man kept the\ngrim reality so fresh in Clint&rsquo;s mind that he couldn&rsquo;t quite\nfathom, for a moment, why the rest of the remaining team were all\ngathered around the fountain waiting for him with various amused\nexpressions on their faces. Even Wanda was there, dragged away from\nVision&rsquo;s cradle-side and standing, cross-armed and bemused beside\nwhere Steve and Bucky both held a giant hot water urn each. Only\nNatasha didn&rsquo;t look entirely convinced that the world&rsquo;s biggest\njoke was about to unfold. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>\n&ldquo;Oh, man, are we throwing a sleeping Stark in the -&rdquo; Sam started,\nvoice amused. And then he must have <i>really </i>caught sight of\nStark, because his tone changed completely. &ldquo;Oh, <i>shit</i>.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>\nClint and Bruce didn&rsquo;t bother to acknowledge him or any of the\nother demands to know what was going on as people either caught sight\nof Stark or got caught up in the confusion about why people&rsquo;s faces\nand reactions were suddenly saying that things weren&rsquo;t funny, any\nmore. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>\n&ldquo;How warm is the water?&rdquo; Bruce panted as he and Clint approached\nthe fountain. &ldquo;Guys!&rdquo; he snapped, when nobody answered fast\nenough. \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>\n&ldquo;Lukewarm, like Clint asked,&rdquo; Steve said, and Sam hurried forward\nto help Bruce and Clint lift Stark into the fountain water. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s\ngoing on? What happened?&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>\nClint relinquished his hold on Stark&rsquo;s legs and stepped away with\nSam before he glanced back at the concerned, and slightly confounded,\nlooking Rogers. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know. F.R.I.D.A.Y has been scanning\nhim, and she can&rsquo;t find anything wrong. But he&rsquo;s got a fever of\n104, and we have to get it down, and Bruce says we can&rsquo;t use\nmedication safely until we know what&rsquo;s got him feverish and why\nneither medical nor F.R.I.D.A.Y can pick it up.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n<br /></p><p>\nBruce was holding Stark up against the side of the fountain with one\narm, awkwardly, and cupping water over his forehead with the other,\nmethodologically trying to get the water to cool him off. And it\nseemed to be working &ndash; for the first time since Clint had seen him\nthat afternoon, Stark stirred and let out a little wordless noise,\nobviously coming to. And then Banner trickled another handful of\nwater over his forehead, and the water ran over Stark&rsquo;s face, and\nthe man completely <i>flipped, </i>going from unconscious to wildly\nfighting Bruce in less time than it took Clint to take two full\nbreaths. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Tony!\nTonyTonyTonyTony &ndash; Hey! Hey! <i>Hey</i>!\nLook at me! <i>Look </i>at\nme!&rdquo; Stark almost managed to twist out of Banner&rsquo;s hold, but that\nonly plunged him further into the water, which made him thrash\nwilder. Several people took steps forward, instinctively trying to\nhelp but not quite knowing how. &ldquo;Look at me!&rdquo; Bruce grabbed him\ntight, again, and hauled him to the wall and then grabbed Stark&rsquo;s\nchin, forcing the man&rsquo;s gaze to his. &ldquo;<i>Look at me</i>.\nYou&rsquo;re fine. You&rsquo;re okay. I&rsquo;m sorry, Tony, I&rsquo;m sorry. But\nyou&rsquo;re burning up. And we need to get your temperature down, okay?\nSo you need to stay in the water.&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Bruce&hellip;\n<i>no</i>&hellip; <i>No</i>,\nI -&rdquo; Stark choked and tried, once again, to get<i> </i>free.\n\n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nsorry,&rdquo; Bruce repeated, and he sounded it, even though he was also\nvery obviously unrelenting. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry; I know. I know. But you\nneed to. I won&rsquo;t put any more on your head, okay? I won&rsquo;t. But I\nneed you to stay in the water, Tony. Okay? Please? For me?&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>The\nnoise Stark made was unnameable. &ldquo;No&hellip;no more&hellip;&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;No\nmore on your head &ndash; I promise. But then you gotta stay, okay?&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Stark\ndidn&rsquo;t reply, simply slumped, suddenly boneless, leaving Bruce to\nclumsily catch him. And Clint hadn&rsquo;t done all he could have &ndash;\nshould have &ndash; before, but he&rsquo;d learned a long time ago that a\nman&rsquo;s current actions and future actions said a lot more than his\npast ones. So he climbed, in jeans but thankfully barefoot, into the\nfountain and plopped down behind Stark and wordlessly pulled him\nagainst his side, holding him above the water so Bruce could have\nboth hands free. Stark was out of it, again; adrenalin all burned\nthrough. Clint wished for the snarky or lewd comments that would\nordinarily have followed his attempts to &lsquo;cuddle&rsquo; Stark in any\nway. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Somebody\nget me Strange,&rdquo; Bruce called over his shoulder, not bothering to\ncheck who followed his order as he checked Stark&rsquo;s vitals and then\nbegan pouring water on the parts of Stark, except his face and head,\nthat protruded out the water. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo;\nWanda said, quietly, and held up the scarf she&rsquo;d been wearing to\nBruce. He blinked at it for a moment. &ldquo;A&hellip; a&hellip;&rdquo; She gave up on\nthe word she did not know. &ldquo;Wet it. For his forehead.&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,\nWanda,&rdquo; Bruce said, his voice becoming the closest to its usual\ngentle lilt for the first time since they&rsquo;d found Stark in his lab.\n\n</p><p><br /></p><p>Bruce\ndipped, wrung and folded the scarf and then placed it on Stark&rsquo;s\nforehead. The man twitched a little in response, but didn&rsquo;t\notherwise react, once again seemingly gone to the world. And then\nBruce sat back on his haunches and scrubbed his hands over his face,\nand Clint watched Stark&rsquo;s chest rise and fall and continued to\npretend he wasn&rsquo;t hyper-aware of all the people hovering silently\naround and watching, at a loss of anything to do but also not willing\nto let Stark out of their sight. Murmuring started up, but before the\nspeakers could decide to make themselves better heard the usual\nspitting fire oval of a portal appeared just before the door and\nStrange stepped through. He took in the scene and raised one eyebrow\nat the sight of the three in the fountain, looking more bemused than\nworried. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Until\nBruce started rattling off Stark&rsquo;s medical stats to him &ndash; then\nStrange&rsquo;s face morphed to one of wide-eyed comprehension before he\nwas leaping forward, ripping off his dishwashing-yellow\ngloves and shoving his fingers on Stark&rsquo;s neck, demanding to know\nwhat happened. The response he got from Steve did not please him at\nall. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh,\nso <i>something </i>was\nattacking the city, and <i>something </i>happened\nbetween then and Stark coming home and now <i>something </i>is\nwrong. How detailed, Rogers,&rdquo;\nhe snapped, gently hip-checking a hovering Bruce out of his way. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Medical\nchecked him out post-battle and they cleared him,&rdquo; Steve said, a\ntouch defensively. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wonderful\n&ndash; they studied all those years to become <i>professional\n</i>idiots,&rdquo; Strange fired back\nwithout missing a beat, giving Clint his first real-life encounter\nwith the infamous surgeon he&rsquo;d heard so much about before the man\nhad taken up magic. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;His\nAI has been routinely scanning him since the battle and has found\nnothing to explain his rising fever,&rdquo; Bruce put in, his hands\nnervously spinning his glasses around and around. &ldquo;Medically, he&rsquo;s\nsound. He <i>should </i>be\nsound.&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;What\nmagical interferences does his AI scan for?&rdquo; Strange asked, scarred\nhands finally leaving Stark to hover in a strange formation above the\nman&rsquo;s chest. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo;\nBruce blinked, looked to Clint bewilderedly, and then swung his gaze\nto the rest of the team, looking for answers Clint knew none of them\nhad. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&hellip; think she scans&hellip; for magic&hellip;&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;But\nthis being you were fighting earlier was magic? And used magical\nattacks?&rdquo; Strange said in a tone full of barely-restrained\npatronisation. Bruce looked to Steve, who murmured a slightly abashed\naffirmative. &ldquo;Well, then, I&rsquo;m thinking the cause of the\nmysterious non-medical fever <i>may </i>be\n<i>magic</i>, then.&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>If\nStrange was expecting a reply of some sort, he didn&rsquo;t show it, but\nsimply started moving his fingers in odd patterns around Stark&rsquo;s\nbody, muttering things too soft for Clint to hear. Everybody else was\ntensely silent, hovering as close as they dared and watching the\nproceedings like hawks. They needn&rsquo;t have looked quite so closely &ndash;\nnobody could have missed the sudden yellow-green flare that appeared\nfrom Stark&rsquo;s thigh, right where, Clint was guessing, the Vine\nMaster had slammed an attack into Stark earlier. Strange&rsquo;s face,\nwhen he stopped his magic and straightened, was grim. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\ndon&rsquo;t know if I can combat this magic without the caster. I&rsquo;m\ngoing to send word to Wong to try, but our best course of action is\nto make the guy who did this help us take it back. Does anybody here\nknow where he&rsquo;s being held?&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\ncan find out,&rdquo; Natasha said, at once, and turned on her heel\nwithout waiting for a response. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Strange\nnodded after her. &ldquo;What do we do in the meantime?&rdquo; Bruce asked\nurgently. &ldquo;Surely there&rsquo;s <i>something</i>?&rdquo;\n\n</p><p><br /></p><p>Strange\ntipped his head. &ldquo;You can give him whatever fever reducers and\nlow-dose painkillers you have in stock to try and combat the fever.\nOther than that&hellip;&rdquo; Bruce&rsquo;s jaw worked, and Strange sighed and\nsoftened, a little. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Doctor Banner, but this magic\nis&hellip; It&rsquo;s a drain. It&rsquo;s pulling energy out of him in a way that\nhis body is interpreting as an invading pathogen and extreme pain at\nthe same time. There&rsquo;s no real cause to fight, in this case, so\nwe&rsquo;ll have to try and tackle the symptoms for now; try to lesson\nthem and make him as comfortable as possible.&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Bruce\nopened his mouth, looking frustrated, then simply sighed, nodded and\nmuttered about going to find some medication, then. Strange knelt\nbeside the fountain and reached for Stark again, checking his pulse.\nHis frown deepened and, dropping his hand, he began to massage\nStark&rsquo;s chest. Clint let go of his hold, shifting back so that\nStrange had more access, balancing Stark precariously about him. It\nwasn&rsquo;t three minutes later before Stark began to twitch, his face\nno longer slack but scrunched in discomfort, his exhales starting to\nsound like whines. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;re\nyou doing, dude?&rdquo; Quill demanded. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Strange\nwas frowning even deeper. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t me,&rdquo; he muttered, mostly\ndistracted. &ldquo;This <i>should </i>be\nhis reaction; I assumed he was simply too deeply unconscious to\nshow&hellip;&rdquo; He puzzled for another moment, hands hovering over Stark&rsquo;s\nchest, and even though he wasn&rsquo;t touching him, Stark began to\nwrithe harder, breaths beginning to turn to pants. And then Strange&rsquo;s\nexpression cleared. &ldquo;How did you find him?&rdquo; he demanded of Clint.\n\n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip;\npassed out? On his lab floor. Under a sofa &ndash; he made his AI drop\nhis sofa on him.&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;He\n<i>what</i>?&rdquo; Sam\nexclaimed. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>But\nStrange smiled, slightly. &ldquo;Gate control theory,&rdquo; he said, just as\nBruce reappeared. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Oh</i>,&rdquo;\nBruce exclaimed, just as Clint demanded, &ldquo;<i>What?</i>&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;The\ngate control theory of pain,&rdquo; Strange said, beginning to massage\nagain, but this time doing so all over Stark&rsquo;s torso. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;If\nyou&hellip; uh&hellip; flood the brain with non-painful input, it &lsquo;closes&rsquo;\nthe &lsquo;pain gates&rsquo; in the brain,&rdquo; Bruce picked up from Strange.\n&ldquo;So the more you force yourself to feel something else, the less\nyour brain processes and informs you about the pain.&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hence\ndropping a sofa on yourself &ndash; that&rsquo;s input to the nth degree,&rdquo;\nStrange said, and then muttered, &ldquo;Damn, it, Stark, you idiot,&rdquo;\nunder his breath. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;So\nthat means&hellip;?&rdquo; Rocket said, his voice still blank from\ncomprehension. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;That\nmeans, Barton, that you&rsquo;d better start holding him very tightly\nonce again,&rdquo; Strange said, and Clint followed his orders at once.\n&ldquo;Keep as much input as you can going into him at all times; it will\ndefinitely help.&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Strange.\nI have the location. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; At the sorcerer&rsquo;s look she put\non a smirk that didn&rsquo;t reach her eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming with to&hellip;\n<i>assist</i>&hellip; in the\ninformation extraction.&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Strange\nsnorted, rose to his feet and then, just before he reached Natasha he\nturned back somewhat to Bruce. &ldquo;Banner&hellip; I&rsquo;d add some\nnitroglycerin to the cocktail you&rsquo;re going to give him.&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Bruce&rsquo;s\nface blanched. &ldquo;Bad?&rdquo; he said, sounding resigned. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Not\nyet, but I think it&rsquo;s going to go there.&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Get\nthe counteraction quickly, then,&rdquo; Banner almost-demanded, and\nStrange nodded before opening a portal for him and Natasha to walk\nthrough.</p><p><br /></p><p>Bruce\nscrubbed at his face, again, for a moment, and then settled beside\nStark and started administering medication. Clint held on while Stark\ngot the shots, and for ages afterwards, until his muscles were\nstarting to strain from the continuous pressure. Bruce took Stark&rsquo;s\ntemperature with a digital thermometer and then declared they could\ntake him inside. Steve started forward, hesitantly, wordlessly\noffering his strength, but before Bruce could say anything tendrils\nof red wrapped themselves coyly around Stark&rsquo;s form and lifted him\nright out of Clint&rsquo;s arms. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Where\nare we taking him?&rdquo; Wanda asked, calmly, her eyes glowing red and\nher hold on Stark steady. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>They\ntook him to the medbay, small as it was, because F.R.I.D.A.Y was\nintegrated into the room and because having sensors on Stark made\nthem feel better, even though they couldn&rsquo;t help much. Before Wanda\nplaced Stark on the bed, Bruce kicked off his shoes and lay down\nfirst, telling her to put Stark on top of him so he could wrap\nhimself around Stark as best he could. Steve excused himself in a\nmutter to go and call Pepper &ndash; she didn&rsquo;t know anything about\nthis, yet, and he thought she had the right to. Sam dragged a chair\nto the foot of the bed and began massaging Stark&rsquo;s feet and\nwet-underarmour-clad legs with practised hands, while Banner let\nhimself drop his face against Stark&rsquo;s hair, something in his face\n<i>daring </i>anybody to say\nanything. Even Rocket didn&rsquo;t make a comment, choosing instead to\nslink away and leave Bruce, Stark and Sam in peace. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>He\ncame back, though &ndash; all of the team cycled through the room, even\nthough most did not attempt to help massage Stark but simply talked,\nquietly, to Bruce or amongst themselves or sat silently in the\ncorner, keeping watch over something they could not see. Clint took\nover from Bruce when the other man had to relieve himself and also do\ndoctor-y things on Stark, again, and Clint saw him frowning at the\ntablet screen in his hand when he quietly asked F.R.I.D.A.Y for an\nEKG. Unease writhed in Clint&rsquo;s gut, and, when Bruce was out the\nroom for a moment, he decided to try and emulate the massaging he&rsquo;d\nseen Strange do on Stark&rsquo;s chest. It had looked simple enough. And\nit was supposedly to help, right?<br /><br /></p><p>About\nthree minutes in, Stark jerked almost-violently in his arms. &ldquo;<i>Don&rsquo;t</i>.&rdquo;\nClint supposed the word was supposed to be a snarl instead of the\nbreathless half-moan. &ldquo;&rsquo;n&rsquo;t touch.&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay,\nokay.&rdquo; Clint raised both hands in surrender, even though Stark\nhadn&rsquo;t actually managed to open his eyes. &ldquo;Jeesh, <i>sorry</i>.&rdquo;\nStark grunted, softly. And then, a few beats later, Clint added\nanother <i>sorry</i> for\neverything since the accords that they hadn&rsquo;t spoken about. Stark\ndidn&rsquo;t reply to that, but he did suddenly move so that he was more\nin Clint&rsquo;s embrace, face almost in the crook of his neck, and Clint\nthought, not for the first time, that the beginning of understanding\nand mending looked flipping <i>weird </i>every\ntime he came into contact with it. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Despite\nwhatever Banner was trying, and despite the fact that Quill had also\ntried his hand at massaging, looking unsure and awkward and red-eared\nbut also determined, Stark continued to deteriorate. His fever\ncontinued to climb slowly but surely, no matter what they did, and by\nthe time evening had turned properly to night he was wheezing rather\nthan breathing, twitching and moaning no matter how hard Bruce held\nonto him from behind or how frantically people massaged. Nat wasn&rsquo;t\nanswering Clint&rsquo;s messages, meaning she had nothing to report, and\neverybody was on edge, even Bucky and Steve who had yet to hover\ncloser than just outside the doorway of the medical room. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Clint\nhad just started to wish something, <i>anything</i>,\nwould come and break the silent, brooding, watching tension, when his\nwish was granted in the worst possible way. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey,\nguys, what&rsquo;s going on? I couldn&rsquo;t find <i>anybody </i>in\nthis place and F.R.I.D.A.Y said you were all&hellip;&rdquo; Everybody\nswivelled to face Parker, whose cheery expression slipped somewhat at\nthe sight of the wall of stony Avengers. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey,\nkid, don&rsquo;t you have, like, exams?&rdquo; Sam said, trying to casually\nblock Peter&rsquo;s view of the medbay. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,\nbut it&rsquo;s F.R.I.D.A.Y, so I have all weekend, and Mr Stark said\nI&hellip;&rdquo; Peter trailed off. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? What&rsquo;s wrong?\nWhose breathing is all&hellip;?&rdquo; His face turned pale. &ldquo;Mr Stark?&rdquo;\nhe called. &ldquo;Mr Stark, are you here?&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Kid,&rdquo;\nSteve started, gently warning, but Parker&rsquo;s face turned determined\nand he darted and twisted his way into the room. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;What\n<i>happened</i>?&rdquo; he\nyelped, catching sight of Stark, his eyes huge as they turned on\nBruce. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s <i>wrong</i>?&rdquo;\n\n</p><p><br /></p><p>Bruce\nfilled him in as gently as he could &ndash; everything from the call to\nassemble (<i>&ldquo;You should have called me, too! I could have\nhelped!&rdquo;</i>) to Strange figuring\nout the mysterious non-illness that was currently attacking Stark.\nBanner glossed over how much pain Strange had said Stark was in,\nsimply alluding to the fact that the magic was making Stark\nuncomfortable and that the other input was helping with that. Or had\nbeen, Clint added, silently. It looked like their miraculous\ntemporary cure was losing its effectiveness. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Clint&rsquo;s\ngrim thoughts proved to be right when Stark&rsquo;s wheezing turned to\nlow whines of pain, his fingers twitching compulsively even as Bruce\ntried to calm him and asked Sam to administer another shot of pain\nmedication through the IV line. Stark was sweating profusely yet\nagain, and Banner&rsquo;s face was full of lines of worry. Parker&rsquo;s\nrise from the end of Stark&rsquo;s bed was sudden enough that every eye\nin the room turned to him automatically. Ignoring their gazes, but\nturning almost as red as the suit he still wore under his unzipped\nhoodie, Peter crawled carefully onto the bed and then slowly lowered\nhimself on top of Stark before wrapping his arms and legs over him.\nBruce and he had to turn their faces to opposite sides to avoid\nbumping noses &ndash; or something more embarrassing &ndash; but neither of\nthem said a word about it. And, miraculously, neither did anybody\nelse. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;This\nisn&rsquo;t working,&rdquo; Peter said into the silence, almost an hour\nlater. He sounded almost <i>angry</i>.\n&ldquo;Doctor Banner&hellip; his heartbeat.. I&hellip;&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\nknow, kid, I know,&rdquo; Bruce said, heavily. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s&hellip;\nthere&rsquo;s gotta be <i>something</i>.\nI mean&hellip; I mean surely&hellip; F.R.I.D.A.Y, scan him. Search&hellip; search\nother ways to&hellip; to help with pain. We have to&hellip;&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Bruce\nlet go of Stark with one hand and placed it on Peter&rsquo;s back. His\nface was still turned away from Clint&rsquo;s corner of the room, so he\nsaw no expression. But there was no missing the stiffness of Parker&rsquo;s\nspine. How close was it to midnight? He was supposed to leave the\nnext day, early in the morning. Supposed to go back to his wife and\nkids. But Clint hadn&rsquo;t been able to leave the <i>room </i>for\nhours. If Stark was still trapped in medical agony when his ride\ncame&hellip; Clint was almost positive he knew that he&rsquo;d be staying put.\n\n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Doctor\nStrange and Agent Romanov have returned,&rdquo; F.R.I.D.A.Y blurted, and\nClint felt his heart lurch in hope. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Those\noutside the doorway and just within it all flattened themselves\nagainst the walls &ndash; and there was something you didn&rsquo;t see every\nday; Captain America and the White Wolf trying to make themselves\nsmall &ndash; and Strange strode in, magic already on his fingers. But\ninstead of going straight to Stark he began drawing a pattern on the\nfloor. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Is\nhe seriously doing a pentagram?&rdquo; Wanda asked, shocked into\nincredulity. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;\nStrange said, simply, while Peter finally gave in to curiosity and\ntwisted to look, doing an awkward pretzel on top of Stark to manage\nit. &ldquo;Same principle, though. Sort of.&rdquo; Design complete, he turned\nto the Stark-sandwich on the bed. &ldquo;We have to get him inside this.\nBut he has to be concious, and he has to be standing alone.&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Standing</i>?&rdquo;\nRocket barked. &ldquo;Dude, I don&rsquo;t know how hard your cloak banged you\ninto a building, but &ndash; &rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;He\nhas to be able to make a line with his body, or this won&rsquo;t work,&rdquo;\nthe sorcerer snapped back, making only a little bit of sense. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>He\nleft his magic circle and made it to Stark&rsquo;s bedside, making Peter\nwithdraw and Bruce look politely away as he began trying to wake the\nman. When traditional methods didn&rsquo;t work, he sighed and began\nmassaging at Stark&rsquo;s chest. Clint winced a little, remembering the\ngenius&rsquo; reaction to the touch earlier. But even that didn&rsquo;t seem\nto be rousing the man and Clint&rsquo;s worry began to sink deeper. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t\nthat&hellip; I mean&hellip; doesn&rsquo;t it hurt?&rdquo; It was only because Clint was\nso close that he heard Parker&rsquo;s very soft question. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;No,\nactually, this is helping regulate his heartbeat a little.&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;No&hellip;\nI&hellip; uh&hellip; I mean&hellip; <i>you</i>.\nIsn&rsquo;t it&hellip;?&rdquo; Parker went red, eyes sliding very obviously away\nfrom Strange&rsquo;s scarred hands. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Strange\nlet out an almost-laugh. &ldquo;Like hell,&rdquo; he admitted, voice even\nquieter than Parker&rsquo;s. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Clint\nsaw Parker lick his lips. &ldquo;Then&hellip; could you&hellip; teach me? So I can,\ninstead?&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>It\nwas one of the most bizarre sights Clint had ever witnessed &ndash; the\ncounterpart of the Hulk acting as a bottom body pillow to an\nunconscious, sweaty, wheezing Stark while the Sorcerer Supreme talked\nSpider-Man, who was still mostly lying <i>on </i>Stark,\nthrough massaging the genius&rsquo; chest correctly. When Peter got the\nhang of it, Strange asked Bruce where he kept a certain drug and then\ncarefully fed it into the IV line. Stark started stirring not long\nafter that. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Pete?&rdquo;\nhe whispered, sounding confused. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hi,\nMr Stark.&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Clint\nwanted, suddenly, to tell Parker to stop touching Stark&rsquo;s chest. He\ndidn&rsquo;t want to have to see the hurt he <i>knew </i>would\nflash all through the kid when Stark reacted violently to Parker&rsquo;s\nmassaging. But Stark&rsquo;s eyes roved over Parker, and what his hands\nwere doing, and then they rolled drunkenly, not quite tracking, to\nStrange without so much as an increase in his breathing. The noise he\nlet out was nowhere near any language Clint had ever heard, but\nStrange seemed to half-understand enough to reply. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;We\nknow how to make it stop. We just have to get you into that circle,\nthere.&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Strange\nmotioned Peter to get off, and the kid reluctantly agreed, slipping\nright to the end of the bed until Strange and Bruce started helping\nStark into a seated position &ndash; then he shimmied forward, again, and\npulled one of Stark&rsquo;s arms over his shoulders while Bruce\ndisconnected the IV line. Single-handedly, Parker managed to heave \nStark off the bed and keep him on his feet, a sight that would have\nbeen comical under any other circumstance. Banner took Stark&rsquo;s\nother side and they began carrying Stark &ndash; there was no other word\nfor it; the man&rsquo;s feet weren&rsquo;t even lifting, his head was lolling\nonto Parker&rsquo;s shoulder, his entire body slumped bonelessly &ndash; to\nthe magical mark on the floor Strange stood in front of. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Stark&hellip;\nit will only take a moment, but you need to be standing for it.&rdquo;\nStark didn&rsquo;t react. &ldquo;Tony. <i>Tony</i>.&rdquo;\n\n</p><p><br /></p><p>Stark\nopened his eyes and managed to fix a wavering, dull-eyed glance on\nStrange. Slowly, with such painful precision that it chewed apart\nClint&rsquo;s gut, Stark pulled his arm from Bruce&rsquo;s shoulders. He\nalmost toppled right over, only Parker&rsquo;s quick reflexes keeping him\non his feet, mostly flopped over like the doll Lila used to hang over\nher arm. The sight was sickening in its wrongness. And it only got\nworse &ndash; no matter how much Stark tried to get his knees to lock,\nthey simply wouldn&rsquo;t. Three minutes of obvious struggling only\nresulted in him gasping for breath and slumping almost entirely\nagainst a completely freaked-out looking Parker. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;What\nif he kneels?&rdquo; Bucky asked, suddenly. Clint tried to pretend he\ndidn&rsquo;t see how violently Bucky&rsquo;s voice made Stark <i>flinch</i>.\n&ldquo;That will still make a line with his body, right?&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Strange\nmulled it over. &ldquo;It&hellip; could work.&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Dude,&rdquo;\nQuill said, quietly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the best you&rsquo;re gonna get. And even\nthat&rsquo;s gonna be a cost.&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Bruce\nmoved back to Stark&rsquo;s side, and he and Parker helped the trembling\nman into the circle, lowering him to his hands and knees before they\nlet him go and backed away. Stark was exhaling whines of pain, again\n&ndash; no sensory input meant he was feeling it <i>all</i>.\nA particularly guttural moan had Bruce putting a hand on Peter&rsquo;s\nshoulder to hold the kid in place &ndash; he looked as though he was\nabout to either bolt to Stark&rsquo;s side or out the door. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\nneed you up straight,&rdquo; Strange said, very quietly, almost gently.\n&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take long.&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>With\nmomentous effort, Stark pushed himself onto his knees, weaving\ndrunkenly the whole way and swaying like he was at a concert once he\nwas mostly upright. His face was completely devoid of colour except\nfor the fever-red splotches, and he wasn&rsquo;t even bothering to try\nand keep his eyes open. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Please</i>,&rdquo;\nwas all he whispered. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Strange\nchanted so fast the words seemed to be a blur, making motions from\nStark&rsquo;s face to the ground and back up again. The circle glowed,\nStark&rsquo;s thigh glowed in response and then the glow rose out of him,\nand Strange caught it and pulled it into pieces in the air. The\nglowing stopped and Stark folded like a puppet with cut strings. <i>(&ldquo;I\ngot no strings to hold me down&hellip;&rdquo; Whispered gleefully in some part\nof Clint&rsquo;s mind</i>.<i>)\n</i>Bruce, Strange and Parker all\ndarted forward at once. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Hell</i>,&rdquo;\nStark groaned. &ldquo;&rsquo;s&hellip; gone. &lsquo;S&hellip; f&rsquo;ly&hellip; gone&hellip;&rdquo; \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Parker\nlaughed, high and shaky, and the two doctors started attending to\ntheir patient, and just like that it was all over. Crisis averted.\nEverybody could go to bed with relief thrumming in their veins,\nlooking forward to the next day with nothing hanging over their\nheads. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>Except&hellip;\nthose things never really over when they ended, were they? Clint knew\nthis with a long-aquainted certainty, and he knew he wasn&rsquo;t the\nonly one on the team who did. But they never seemed to <i>really\n</i>acknowledge that fact. And he\nwas starting to think that maybe they should &ndash; that maybe it wasn&rsquo;t\nonly Stark who kept the wounds festering, and that maybe even Stark\ndidn&rsquo;t do it as willingly as Clint had always flippantly dismissed.\n\n</p><p><br /></p><p>Sometime\nnear the crack of dawn, once Clint had finished packing, he returned\nquietly to the medbay. Pepper had gotten in sometime near three AM,\nand she was seated on the bed beside Stark, his head in her lap.\nCurled up against Stark, like he&rsquo;d been since they&rsquo;d put Stark\nback on the bed despite gentle reminders that it was over and that\nStark didn&rsquo;t have to be held any more, lay Parker, dead to the\nworld. Pepper had one hand on his head while the other played with\nStark&rsquo;s hair, gently, rhythmically. \n</p><p><br /></p><p>There\nwas a look on her face that he&rsquo;d seen on Laura&rsquo;s so often that it\ncut Clint straight to the core, burning-agony in its bitter-sweet\nmixing of love and pain. \n</p>",
