        "body": "<p>I must admit, as a jonsa shipper that I really like most of your metas on the subject. First of all, I would like to apologize for my use of english; I am not a native speaker and I know my use of such language to be far from perfect so please, if you finally take the time to read the post I am about to write and the reasons to write it, feel free to make any reference to any mistake you can find, it will be in my personal interest.</p><p><br/></p><p>As I implied before, this is a jonsa post, but i believe it to be kinda different from the rest because I won\u2019t be using foreshadowing from the books ( I don\u2019t even know how to do it properly) nor the show. Anyone can find that on other amazing posts there are around which were made by people able to do them far better than myself. What is really important here is the structure of the story and how I\u2019ve come to understand ASOIAF (books and show). The second reason why I will do it this way is because I agree with a full lot of people out there that at the end, every ship, from Jonsa to Jonerys it is nothing else than a whish, and when we hope something strongly enough we begin to project it under every light, for any excuses, seeing any quote or any passage as foreshadowing something. Please don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019ve learn from a full lot of metas; some of them are amazing and have brought light to some events. But the point for me is that no one at this point (except the obvious ones) know how this amazing story will end, that doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re not right: I\u2019ve found around there people posting about R+L=J in the books for years, and then asking jonsa meta creators to find a quote that proves their theory to be true. My answer for such arguments is that nowadays, as long as the books go, there is not a single solid proof that R+L=J, just foreshadowing, and as the TV show confirmed, that never meant they were wrong.</p><p><br/></p><p>At the end of season 6 I was quite hyped about Jonerys options. Dany was finally moving to westeros with her army, dragons, Dorne and High Garden at her back and Jon had just be named King in the North with the Vale bonded to him to some extent. Dany had left Naharis behind in order to be able to forge an alliance through marriage, but there were just 3 bachelors politically worthy of her hand: Euron, Sweet Robin and Jon Snow. Euron was out of question since she choosed to support Asha\u2019s claim, and Sweet Robin&hellip; Well&hellip; Jon Snow was the remaining and perfect match allowing her to become Queen in the North by marriage, and tie The Vale to her claim along Dorne and The Reach; leaving Cersei with the ravaged Riverlands which are not really loyal to her nor the Freys, Casterly Rock and its bannermen who had fought several battles and lost a huge amount of men since the war begun, the Iron Islands (which are poor and divided) and some support from the Stormlands. It seemed good, yet Dany suddenly forgot why she let her lover behind and started to make demands as a stupid and spoiled teenager. I never got to understand why the idea never came to her or Tyrion\u2019s\u00a0 (who should be smart enough and keen to Jon Snow) minds, it was stupid at best.</p><p><br/></p><p>When season seven came to an end I was extremely dissapointed with the season and needing more I started to read the books, and I\u2019ve come to read them all 4 times since then. Then I started to wonder about the endgame, coming to a vague yet huge realasation: it\u2019s all about R+L=J. Some would say it is obvious yet most of\u00a0 people don\u2019t come to fully understand such a statement. It is not about Jon becoming King because he is the true heir of Aerys Targaryen, ASOIAF is not this kind of story (Stannis was right about his claim from the beginning yet no one gave a shit) in fact your best buddy and your crippled\u00a0\u2018\u2019prophet\u2019\u2019 brother saying you are and then your father\u2019s best friend (Howland Reed) confirming it doesn\u2019t make it a claim, but a rumour: it is people accepting it which makes it a claim (like Renlie\u2019s, who never really had one). The point of George foreshadowing R+L=J it\u2019s not just poetical, it must be instrumental for his story; useful for the endgame, and what makes me feel that way is the fact that GRR Martin has been spending time on this plot from the very Ned\u2019s first chapter (I mean Robert\u2019s quote about kings hiding under the snow\u00a0 in the crypts of winterfell). We all know how long George takes to write a book and it would be useless to develop such a plot for no reason and spending years trying to show and hide the truth at the same time, chosing the right words, where to put them&hellip; R+L=J is essential to his story and that feeling is what made us aware that Jon would come back from death.</p><p><br/></p><p>\n\nIf Dany and Jon were about to rule together it wouldn\u2019t matter whose claim is better; she holds the true power and not even the claim would matter if it isn\u2019t his it whould be hers, so, if this was the outcome of all, why has GRRMartin spent his time in R+L=J\u2019s plot; just to add drama to this couple? Just to add a little problem that they will eventually solve and live happily ever after? Sounds shitty and a waste to make it just a detail because if with this outcome you took R+L=J out of ASOIAF, there would be almost no difference but preventing an incestous romance.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>After realising this I started wondering how would it play out with Jon\u2019s claim\u00a0 being accepted. There are two possibilities: everyone respect him enough after the long night not to give a shit, or people would prefer him rather than the alternative. Right now, in the show Jon Snow is King in the North, but he is weak, He does not hold men of his own, nor a castle (Sansa is lady of Winterfell not him) he is king by deference, not by power but the wildlings and they were few enough before the battle of the bastards, he is a weak king and a king under the pretension that he is Ned\u2019s Stark son, who he is not. R+L=J can do nothing but jeopardize his authority and once this happens he will be useless to Daenerys (even if she loves him). Then we have the southern lords, whose rights will be at stake if a military strong ruler would end at the Iron Throne (after all feudalism meant the power struggle of the local noblemen against the crown for their own rights and privileges). For them, someone like Dany is not a dream but a threat (she even admitted she wants to break the wheel). R+L=J gives them the chance to deny her claim in exchange for a king who holds nothing but respect instead of a foreigner who doesn\u2019t respect anything but her own power and entitlement. You may think what you want but for me R+L=J being actually important makes Jonerys impossible, or better, making Jonerys the endgame makes R+L=J nothing but such a pairing creepy as hell.</p><p><br/></p><p>In the other hand; King Jon could marry a lot of women (at least in the books); Margeary, Val, Cersei (I know it\u2019s almost impossible but I am just listing), Myranda Royce, Arianne Martell&hellip; But King Jon being a weak king will need a strong political engagement in order to get support and strength, and those kind of fiances are not\u00a0 common: Myranda Royce is from a minor branch of Royce family and doesn\u2019t exist in the show, Val is not even a princess just a free woman who doesn\u2019t exist in the show, Margeary Tyrell would make a great option as long as she lives and is unmarried (not in the show anymore) as Arianne (a crybaby more concerned for her own rights than for Dorne itself who doesn\u2019t exist in the show). As far as the show goes there are just 2 women that are not Daenerys that fit the role: Cersei and Sansa (Lyanna Mormont is not a valid option since her house is to little and unimportant and she is a child).\u00a0 Just those 2&hellip;\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>Lot of people would say Sansa is his sister (to some extent), but the truth being said she is not, they\u2019re cousins: why? Because R+L=J. If Jonsa would be endgame, a possibility no one can confirm nor deny, R+L=J would have a double instrumentality and this is why Jonsa is my ship instead of Jonerys, because it makes the most important hide plot of ASOIAF essential for 2 reasons instead of completely useless. Some can say that it is unlikely GRRMartin to write such a farytailed story, but from my perspective, no matter how cruel, cynical and unfair the world of ice and fire is, his story is still a song.</p>",

Dany was finally moving to westeros with her army, dragons, Dorne and High Garden at her back and Jon had just be named King in the North with the Vale bonded to him to some extent. Dany had left Naharis behind in order to be able to forge an alliance through marriage, but there were just 3 bachelors politically worthy of her hand: Euron, Sweet Robin and Jon Snow. Euron was out of question since she choosed to support Asha\u2019s claim, and Sweet Robin\u2026 Well\u2026 Jon Snow was the remaining and perfect match allowing her to become Queen in the North by marriage, and tie The Vale to her claim along Dorne and The Reach; leaving Cersei with the ravaged Riverlands which are not really loyal to her nor the Freys, Casterly Rock and its bannermen who had fought several battles and lost a huge amount of men since the war begun, the Iron Islands (which are poor and divided) and some support from the Stormlands. It seemed good, yet Dany suddenly forgot why she let her lover behind and started to make demands as a stupid and spoiled teenager. I never got to understand why the idea never came to her or Tyrion\u2019s\u00a0 (who should be smart enough and keen to Jon Snow) minds, it was stupid at best.</p><p><br></p><p>When season seven came to an end I was extremely dissapointed with the season and needing more I started to read the books, and I\u2019ve come to read them all 4 times since then.

Some would say it is obvious yet most of\u00a0 people don\u2019t come to fully understand such a statement. It is not about Jon becoming King because he is the true heir of Aerys Targaryen, ASOIAF is not this kind of story (Stannis was right about his claim from the beginning yet no one gave a shit) in fact your best buddy and your crippled\u00a0\u2018\u2019prophet\u2019\u2019 brother saying you are and then your father\u2019s best friend (Howland Reed) confirming it doesn\u2019t make it a claim, but a rumour: it is people accepting it which makes it a claim (like Renlie\u2019s, who never really had one). The point of George foreshadowing R+L=J it\u2019s not just poetical, it must be instrumental for his story; useful for the endgame, and what makes me feel that way is the fact that GRR Martin has been spending time on this plot from the very Ned\u2019s first chapter (I mean Robert\u2019s quote about kings hiding under the snow\u00a0 in the crypts of winterfell). We all know how long George takes to write a book and it would be useless to develop such a plot for no reason and spending years trying to show and hide the truth at the same time, chosing the right words, where to put them\u2026 R+L=J is essential to his story and that feeling is what made us aware that Jon would come back from death.</p><p><br></p><p>\n\nIf Dany and Jon were about to rule together it wouldn\u2019t matter whose claim is better; she holds the true power and not even the claim would matter if it isn\u2019t his it whould be hers, so, if this was the outcome of all, why has GRRMartin spent his time in R+L=J\u2019s plot; just to add drama to this couple? Just to add a little problem that they will eventually solve and live happily ever after?

Then we have the southern lords, whose rights will be at stake if a military strong ruler would end at the Iron Throne (after all feudalism meant the power struggle of the local noblemen against the crown for their own rights and privileges). For them, someone like Dany is not a dream but a threat (she even admitted she wants to break the wheel). R+L=J gives them the chance to deny her claim in exchange for a king who holds nothing but respect instead of a foreigner who doesn&rsquo;t respect anything but her own power and entitlement. You may think what you want but for me R+L=J being actually important makes Jonerys impossible, or better, making Jonerys the endgame makes R+L=J nothing but such a pairing creepy as hell.</p><p><br /></p><p>In the other hand; King Jon could marry a lot of women (at least in the books); Margeary, Val, Cersei (I know it&rsquo;s almost impossible but I am just listing), Myranda Royce, Arianne Martell&hellip; But King Jon being a weak king will need a strong political engagement in order to get support and strength, and those kind of fiances are not&nbsp; common: Myranda Royce is from a minor branch of Royce family and doesn&rsquo;t exist in the show, Val is not even a princess just a free woman who doesn&rsquo;t exist in the show, Margeary Tyrell would make a great option as long as she lives and is unmarried (not in the show anymore) as Arianne (a crybaby more concerned for her own rights than for Dorne itself who doesn&rsquo;t exist in the show). As far as the show goes there are just 2 women that are not Daenerys that fit the role: Cersei and Sansa (Lyanna Mormont is not a valid option since her house is to little and unimportant and she is a child).&nbsp; Just those 2&hellip;&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Lot of people would say Sansa is his sister (to some extent), but the truth being said she is not, they&rsquo;re cousins: why? Because R+L=J. If Jonsa would be endgame, a possibility no one can confirm nor deny, R+L=J would have a double instrumentality and this is why Jonsa is my ship instead of Jonerys, because it makes the most important hide plot of ASOIAF essential for 2 reasons instead of completely useless. Some can say that it is unlikely GRRMartin to write such a farytailed story, but from my perspective, no matter how cruel, cynical and unfair the world of ice and fire is, his story is still a song.</p>",

Sansa knows how to use her words to avoid enraging people, charming them into doing what she wants (in King\u2019s Landing this was all about staying alive), and building an image of herself that ensures that she\u2019s underestimated by everyone</p><p>2) <b>Networking</b>- not only does Sansa have a great knowledge of Westerosi Houses and history, she uses that knowledge to built a network of contact of people in nearly every kingdom</p><p>3) <b>Propaganda</b>- while characters and fans snicker about her love for songs and fairytale aesthetics, Sansa learns how they function as effective propaganda tools (when she compares them to reality, when she compares the reception between herself and Margaery by the smallfolk when they both did little for them, for example) and she often uses them to understand historical events</p><p>4) <b>How to run a household</b>- after Lysa\u2019s murder, Sansa effectively steps up as both Lady of the Eyrie and her cousin\u2019s guardian just like her mother did when Minisa died</p><p>5) <b>How make plots and spot conspiracies</b>- something she\u2019s learning from Littlefinger, a man who engineered the War of the 5 Kings and plans on making a war of three queens in order to gain as much power as possible. Here she learns the importance of learning the fortunes of lords and ladies, the importance of spies, the importance of reading people so you can tell their motivations.</p><p>6) <b>The importance of finances and debts</b>- tied with the previous point. This is Littlefinger\u2019s main way of gaining\u00a0\u2018supporters\u2019</p><p>7) Sansa (at 13 which is&hellip;.) turned Harry from a dismissive classist fuck boy to a dismissive classist fuckboy interested in her</p><p>8)<b> Calling banners</b>- when Sansa wins over the Vale Lord and condemns Littlefinger to death, she\u2019ll realise that merely calling the banners isn\u2019t enough, that you have to convince your men to fight for you</p><p>9) <b>Sorting diplomatic quagmires</b>- I\u2019m 100% sure that Sansa will be the one to put the Stark succession crisis to an end by getting all the different factions to agree with one another, preventing a civil war. Out of all of her siblings, she has the diplomatic abilities to do so</p><p>10) <b>Food relief</b>- she\u2019ll also be in charge of distributing the Vale\u2019s supply of food in the North and (likely) in the South too which isn\u2019t easy as there are millions to feed for a long period of time</p><p>11) <b>Managing people during sieges</b>- she\u2019ll survive the Siege at Winterfell. Winterfell in the books is designed to survive the Others. Just like we saw in the Battle of Blackwater, Sansa will keep the morale up and will help keep people alive inside (especially if Stannis is still alive at this point.

                "content": "<p>That&rsquo;s bullshit. Let me list the skills Sansa has picked and will pick over the course of the 7 book.</p><p>1) <b>Diplomacy</b>- only they call it courtesy. Sansa knows how to use her words to avoid enraging people, charming them into doing what she wants (in King&rsquo;s Landing this was all about staying alive), and building an image of herself that ensures that she&rsquo;s underestimated by everyone</p><p>2) <b>Networking</b>- not only does Sansa have a great knowledge of Westerosi Houses and history, she uses that knowledge to built a network of contact of people in nearly every kingdom</p><p>3) <b>Propaganda</b>- while characters and fans snicker about her love for songs and fairytale aesthetics, Sansa learns how they function as effective propaganda tools (when she compares them to reality, when she compares the reception between herself and Margaery by the smallfolk when they both did little for them, for example) and she often uses them to understand historical events</p><p>4) <b>How to run a household</b>- after Lysa&rsquo;s murder, Sansa effectively steps up as both Lady of the Eyrie and her cousin&rsquo;s guardian just like her mother did when Minisa died</p><p>5) <b>How make plots and spot conspiracies</b>- something she&rsquo;s learning from Littlefinger, a man who engineered the War of the 5 Kings and plans on making a war of three queens in order to gain as much power as possible. Here she learns the importance of learning the fortunes of lords and ladies, the importance of spies, the importance of reading people so you can tell their motivations.</p><p>6) <b>The importance of finances and debts</b>- tied with the previous point. This is Littlefinger&rsquo;s main way of gaining&nbsp;&lsquo;supporters&rsquo;</p><p>7) Sansa (at 13 which is&hellip;.) turned Harry from a dismissive classist fuck boy to a dismissive classist fuckboy interested in her</p><p>8)<b> Calling banners</b>- when Sansa wins over the Vale Lord and condemns Littlefinger to death, she&rsquo;ll realise that merely calling the banners isn&rsquo;t enough, that you have to convince your men to fight for you</p><p>9) <b>Sorting diplomatic quagmires</b>- I&rsquo;m 100% sure that Sansa will be the one to put the Stark succession crisis to an end by getting all the different factions to agree with one another, preventing a civil war. Out of all of her siblings, she has the diplomatic abilities to do so</p><p>10) <b>Food relief</b>- she&rsquo;ll also be in charge of distributing the Vale&rsquo;s supply of food in the North and (likely) in the South too which isn&rsquo;t easy as there are millions to feed for a long period of time</p><p>11) <b>Managing people during sieges</b>- she&rsquo;ll survive the Siege at Winterfell.

He has the least against the Starks, of all the other enemies, but Stannis will never accept another king or Northern independence. Do you think Robb would have tried to fight it out, or would he try to find some way back from independence?",
        "answer": "<p>He absolutely would have fought to establish himself as the sole king if Westeros. Arguably, Stannis\u2019s character arc has his failure as his crucible, purging some (but not all) of his negative traits on the Blackwater. A Stannis victory would have been seen as a fatalistic preordainment in his mind, and so changing, to become the man who saved the realm to rule it rather than the other way around wouldn\u2019t happen. </p><p>Similarly, Robb wouldn\u2019t have surrendered the crown. His bannerman elevated him to protect them from a selfish Iron Throne who kept killing them. Sadly, the inability for the anti-Lannister coalition to elevate a single king the way the anti-Targaryen coalition did would doom them to war even when the Lannisters could have been removed.</p><p>Thanks for the question, Bith.</p><p>SomethingLikeALawyer, Hand of the King</p>",
