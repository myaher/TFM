On her right hand, a bright orange that changed almost every moment, quick and fleeting. Sometimes there\u2019d be little drawings, detailed pounding hearts or sloppily constructed portraits. While the orange script vanished and reappeared as a constant, Maria\u2019s left hand stayed static, the same dark blue writing having never changed in over twelve years. </p><p>Head perched in his mother\u2019s lap, Tony played with her hands, marveling quietly at the contrast. \u201cMama, why don\u2019t the red thoughts change anymore?\u201d </p><p>Maria pulled her hand back, rubbing her palm with her thumb, almost tracing the words. Tony was old enough to read now. He could see the words <i>I wish I could have met you</i> clearly, written almost like it was scribbled in a rush all along her hand. </p><p>Immediately, the orange writing changed: <i>Don\u2019t be sad, I hate it when you\u2019re sad</i>. Tony pulled away. Had he upset mama? But quickly, Maria rushed to gather him in her arms, holding him tight. \u201cTony, you remember what the writing means right?\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded, still trying to figure out whether he had upset his mother or not. \u201cThe right hand is your soul mate who\u2019s your best friend and the left is your soul mate that you marry.\u201d</p><p>Maria smiled, pinching his cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s right. And do you remember why the words always change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s their most important thought.\u201d he answered, proud when his mother nodded.</p><p>\u201cBut sometimes\u2026\u201d her voice trailed off, locked in a pain Tony didn\u2019t yet understand, \u201csometimes the words stay frozen because that\u2019s the person\u2019s last thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can someone stop thinking?\u201d Tony scrunched his nose. </p><p>He knew for sure that could never happen to him. Even when he didn\u2019t want them, his thoughts raced faster than even he could keep up with sometimes. Maria looked down at her hand. \u201cSometimes your soul mate dies.\u201d she says quietly, \u201cAnd the last thing they ever thought stays on your skin forever.\u201d </p><p>Tony frowned. \u201cBut your soul-mate is supposed to <i>be</i> with you forever.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAt least I had a soul-mate Tony. Some people aren\u2019t so lucky.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s frown deepened, a small kernel of anxiety clustering in his stomach, only to grow bigger with time. How could not everyone have a soul mate? That didn\u2019t seem fair. Was it because there weren\u2019t enough people? Or was it because some people are just impossible to love at all? </p><p>Tony\u2019s voice was small, insecure and anxious, \u201cWill I get soul-mates?\u201d</p><p>Maria gathered him in her arms, pressing kisses into his hair. \u201cDon\u2019t ask questions like that Tony, soul-mates or not, everyone deserves love.\u201d </p><p>He wouldn\u2019t notice until much later that she never really answered his question. Maybe she had known, even then, that he would be difficult to love. </p><!-- more --><p>The day Tony turns ten years old is the most exciting day of his life. He falls asleep when he\u2019s still nine and knows that at 4:35 a.m, the exact time he was born, the writing will appear on his right hand. Whichever person turns ten first triggers the writing for both pairs. If he\u2019s being honest, he\u2019s more excited about his platonic soul-mate than the romantic one. Romance was icky and looked like hard work. Who wanted to always buy flowers all the time? </p><p>The clock ticks its way past ten-thirty p.m, a long time after his bed time. Flipping on his stomach, Tony reaches for his alarm clock, turning the dials to set the alarm for exactly 4:35 a.m. Burying himself into his pillows, Tony waits for the earth to turn. He can\u2019t wait. He just can\u2019t wait. Maybe now he wouldn\u2019t be so lonely all the time. Because now he\u2019d find a best friend <i>and</i> a wife and isn\u2019t that the best combination ever? That\u2019s more than Tony ever wanted. </p><p>He was just tired of being lonely. </p><p>Tony drifts off in a hazy dream. He thinks he catches a glimpse of a little girl with strawberry blonde hair. She looks really pretty. He wakes up before his alarm by only a second, a light burning sensation in his left hand tingling. Tony\u2019s eyes widen, heart battering in this throat as he throws himself off the bed to turn on the lights, watching as a white script with almost curly lettering traces itself along his palm. </p><p><i>Cotton candy rain</i></p><p>Tony furrows his brows before remembering what time it is. Smiling to himself, he watches in fascination as the scope of his soul-mate\u2019s dreams change. So this is the person he would marry? She seems really cute. </p><p>But something bothers him. His right hand isn\u2019t tingling. He scrubs at his palm as though that had anything to do with the process at all but it remains just as blank. That kernel of anxiety pounds into something bigger. Something like dread coiling around it. He has one soul-mate, where\u2019s the other? Why aren\u2019t they connected to him yet? </p><p>Does he just not have one? </p><p>Tony thinks about what will be on his romantic soul-mate\u2019s palm. All the scared thoughts rumbling inside his head. The fears. The insecurities. Immediately, he tries to think of better things. What if she wakes up and thinks those bad things are all about her?? She\u2019d hate him before he ever gets the chance to meet her. And Tony really wants to meet her. More than he wants anything. </p><p>Maybe his platonic soul-mate just comes later. </p><p>Yeah. Maybe that\u2019s it. </p><hr><p>Tony\u2019s platonic soul-mate never comes. </p><p>He\u2019s eighteen now and knows two things. One, Pepper- they couldn\u2019t share their real names- was his soul-mate and he loves her more than anything even though he hasn\u2019t met her yet. Two, he doesn\u2019t need a platonic soul mate or anyone else in the world because he has Rhodey and Rhodey is enough for him. </p><p>The white script flows over his hand, <i>Say I\u2019m just a girl one more time. </i></p><p>Tony winces. He would <i>not</i> want to be the sorry asshole on the other side of that conversation. Without even meaning to, Tony checks his other hand and even though it hasn\u2019t changed in eight years, the blankness still hurts him somewhere farther down than he could hide. His mother tries to tell him that maybe his soul-mate just wasn\u2019t born yet. But Tony knows the truth. He just doesn\u2019t get one. Isn\u2019t worthy of one. Pepper\u2019s just a fluke, some kind of cosmic karma taunting him about how he shouldn\u2019t have any soul-mates, let alone the most wonderful woman in the world. That it\u2019s all just an accident he doesn\u2019t deserve. </p><p><i>Hey. Stop that Tony. I deserve you and only you. </i></p><p>Tony stares at the words, wishing he could brand them on his skin forever. Usually the thoughts appeared automatically, but over the years, Tony and Pepper had learned that if they concentrated hard enough, they could craft their own messages. Tony doesn\u2019t have to try though, for his most sincere appreciation to shine through. \u00a0</p><p>But he knows the truth. His father stopped talking to him the moment he left home, tired of him and unwilling to put up with him. His old socialite circle was grandiose and bursting at the seams, lies upon lies piling up over gossip and half-meant kisses. Even Obadiah, mentor that he was, was never really there when he needed him. Everyone around Tony either loved him and then left him, or never really loved him at all. </p><hr><p>Tony takes over Stark Industries and out of habit, looked down at his right hand and thought this has to be the day. This has to be. But as usual, his skin remains unchanged and he honestly doesn\u2019t know how he can still feel so disappointed every time. He\u2019s hosting interviews today, for the position of his assistant and he\u2019s already tired and really can\u2019t care less. </p><p>And then Virginia Potts walks into the room. \u00a0</p><p>Tony doesn\u2019t know how he knows. Maybe it\u2019s the white blazer suit, the one she had thought about in a choice between it and the blue one. Maybe it\u2019s the crimson writing on her palm she had told him was his colour. Or maybe it\u2019s the way she looks at him that makes him feel like he\u2019s known her his whole life. </p><p>\u201cYou wanna know something really weird?\u201d he asks, smiling at her taken aback expression.</p><p>\u201cDepends.\u201d she answers slowly.</p><p>\u201cI only have one soul-mate and it\u2019s this girl who has Maroon 5 stuck in her head so much my entire hand is just She Will Be Loved lyrics.\u201d </p><p>She pauses, narrowing her eyes like she almost doesn\u2019t want to believe it. \u201cThat\u2019s weird. My soul-mate always complains about the same thing as though heavy metal is any better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-the peak of music.\u201d they say together, and Tony gapes.</p><p>Pepper smiles. \u201cSo I\u2019ve been told anyway.\u201d </p><p>Pepper lifts her hand, showing Tony his own thoughts. <i>Oh my God it\u2019s her. She\u2019s beautiful.</i></p><p>When he runs to hug her, he tries not to let anything ruin the joy coursing through him, even when he catches a glimpse of bright green hand-writing on Pepper\u2019s other hand <i>YOU FOUND YOUR SOUL-MATE AHHHH!!!</i></p><p>Tony doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever felt happier than kissing Pepper for the first time. And yet he still feels half-way happy. Missing some crucial part of himself that he was robbed of. </p><p>But Tony has Pepper. </p><p>Maybe that could be enough. </p><hr><p>On August 10, everything changes. </p><p>Tony\u2019s forty-one now. He\u2019s married Pepper, a small quiet wedding with just their closest circles. Stark Industries has delved into automated weaponry, and despite everything, Tony\u2019s come to terms now, finally, that he can still be loved even without any writing on his right hand. </p><p>He\u2019s making a sandwich to bring back down to the lab when his right hand burns. Jolting, he drops the knife with a hiss, bringing his hand up to see where he had cut it when he freezes. It\u2019s impossible. It\u2019s utterly impossible but- scratchy blue writing scrawls across his hand, <i>!!!!!</i>. </p><p>Tony\u2019s hand shakes. No. There\u2019s no- there\u2019s no way. Thirty years later, there\u2019s no way- there just- there just isn\u2019t- but the words keep changing, faster and faster. <i>I have a soul-mate. Oh my god! Oh my God! Wow! I have TWO soul-mates! </i></p><p>Tony feels his eyes warm with disbelief, tears pooling at the edge of his lashes. He can\u2019t stop staring at the blue writing curving all around his hand as his soul-mate\u2019s thoughts get more and more out of control. Pepper\u2019s thoughts had always been more constrained, elegant almost, even when they were kids. But whoever\u2019s thoughts are on his hand jumps from one idea to the next, a flurry of energy and vitality that brings up every repressed emotion Tony had hidden deep inside come flooding to the surface.</p><p>He has a soul-mate. He has a soul-mate. They appeared for him. He isn\u2019t unloved. He isn\u2019t a flaw in the universe. He\u2019s- he\u2019s whole. </p><p>The tears wash down his cheeks as Tony closes his eyes, bringing his hands up to his face. His whole life, he had felt like some part of him was missing. That there was something he was supposed to be looking for. And now- </p><p><i>Don\u2019t be sad anymore. Your writing is so sad.</i></p><p>Tony\u2019s mouth trembles. The writing shifting again, <i>How do I cheer them up? A joke? </i></p><p>Two seconds later, <i>I don\u2019t know any jokes though\u2026maybe Ben knows some!</i></p><p>Unprompted, the only thought in Tony\u2019s head is, <i>I don\u2019t even know who this person is, but I love them.</i></p><p><i>I love you too!!</i></p><p>And this time, Tony allows himself to laugh, incredulous and thankful. He\u2019s forty-one when his platonic soul-mate sends their first message. His mother was right, Tony had just needed to wait. The universe had never abandoned it him. It was just waiting to give him the perfect person. But this kid\u2026how can Tony be perfect for him? How can he possibly be deserving of being in a child\u2019s life? A kid so happy it\u2019s almost contagious. </p><p>What is a soul-mate? A person whose atoms are made up from the same star you were born from? A person who has one half of your very own soul? A person you never abandon, no matter what? Maybe the universe gave this kid to Tony to prove he still has love to give in a way he never thought he could have. But maybe one day, this child would need him. Maybe not right now, maybe not that second, but sometime, in the future, they would meet, and Tony knows he\u2019s going to spend every moment trying to make that happen and be there for this kid. </p><p><i>I can\u2019t wait to meet you. </i>He can\u2019t help but think.</p><p><i>Me too! I live at</i></p><p>The text cuts off and Tony smiles in spite of himself. He doesn\u2019t know the tricks of the trade yet and it was somehow more endearing than it should\u2019ve been.</p><p><i>You can\u2019t say anything personal except your name yet kiddo </i></p><p><i>That\u2019s dumb. Rules are dumb. Super duper dumb.</i></p><p>Tony snorts. The kid\u2019ll learn to control his thoughts more one day, but as it is, it\u2019s adorable watching him. Tony takes in a breath, still unable to help his smile. He concentrates his thoughts. </p><p><i>I\u2019m Tony</i>. </p><p><i>My name\u2019s Peter! Do I get to meet you soon?? </i></p><p><i>I want to meet you.</i></p><p><i>Is that weird to say?</i></p><p><i>Oh no, you\u2019re gonna see everything I think. </i></p><p><i>Tony!!</i></p><p>Tony bursts out laughing and he doesn\u2019t know how his entire heart can expand until its swelled with adoration over someone he hasn\u2019t met yet. </p><p><i>!!!</i></p><p><i>That\u2019s so nice</i></p><p><i>Wow</i></p><p>Embarrassed, Tony quickly quiets his mind. No need to traumatize the kid with all his issues and troubles with love. </p><p><i>When you\u2019re older, you\u2019ll get better at only letting certain thoughts appear</i></p><p><i>Wait are you old? My soul-mate\u2019s old??</i></p><p><i>I didn\u2019t know that could happen</i></p><p><i>Hey-</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m old, but not that old </i></p><p>Peter keeps on chattering and Tony counts down the days before the universe brings them together.</p><hr><p>It\u2019s a while later, after Peter\u2019s next birthday- his excitement made Tony smile- when Tony finds out just how deep Obadiah\u2019s betrayal went. He sees the files upon files of under the table deals. Weapons sold to terrorists and warlords and profiteers of senseless violence and death. He traces each deal to an attack that killed more innocents than he could count from all parts of the globe. Stark Industries wasn\u2019t protecting anybody. They were tools of murder. </p><p>Tony can\u2019t move. He\u2019s frozen in his chair. He\u2019s<b> </b>the CEO, he\u2019s the one in charge, he\u2019s the one who had been duped all these years by that lying, two-faced son of a bitch. Shit. He really is the worst. Scum. Garbage. How many people died because of him? How much blood is on his hands? What could he have done better- god it was always about what he could\u2019ve done better. Always playing catch up. </p><p>He thought he was the good guy. Turns out he\u2019d been the villain all along. The universe was wrong. He isn\u2019t worthy of love. He doesn\u2019t deserve it. Smartest man alive. Kid genius. The most brilliant mind of our generation. All that means nothing if he can\u2019t use that so called genius for anything that <b>matters</b>.</p><p>Tony\u2019s head falls into his hands and he shakes. There are no tears. No sobs. He just trembles under the weight of everything he could\u2019ve done differently and wishes he could shake hard enough for everything inside of him to fall right out so his guilt doesn\u2019t consume him whole. He should\u2019ve been better. He should\u2019ve been better. </p><p>His right hand burns. </p><p>It stings with such a fierce intensity that it jerks him out of his self-pity. He stares at the blue writing, usually messily scrawled and quick, now bold and in all capitals, looking crisp and authoritative. </p><p><i>You are not a bad person</i></p><p><i>You are not a bad person</i></p><p><i>You are not a bad person</i></p><p>Every time the thought seems to disappear, the words come back bolder, like Peter\u2019s focusing desperately on keeping that one thought coherent. Demanding Tony to read it. Demanding he accept it. Tony watches as Peter battles with his constant stream of ideas to present just this one and he can imagine a little boy, scrunching his face in concentration, clutching his wrist, working so damn <i>hard</i> so that someone like <i>Tony </i>would hear him. </p><p>The tears finally well up in his eyes and Tony can\u2019t help but feel worse because here he was bringing this little kid down. The kid Tony promised to protect is trying to protect him and he really is the <i>worst</i>. </p><p><i>Not the worst. </i></p><p><i>You\u2019re the best Tony</i></p><p><i>The best the best the best </i></p><p><i>I\u2019m your soul mate so I\u2019ll love you forever even if you don\u2019t love yourself yet</i></p><p><i>May says sometimes that takes a while </i></p><p><i>But I\u2019ll tell you everything I love about you</i></p><p><i>Because you\u2019re good </i></p><p><i>You\u2019re good Tony, you\u2019re good</i></p><p><i>You made good jokes</i></p><p><i>You give me better advice than Ned</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re so smart! Sometimes I see words I don\u2019t even know how to say on my hand and I\u2019m like woahhh!!</i></p><p><i>And you always say nice things to me</i></p><p><i>And you give me funny nicknames</i></p><p><i>No one gives me nicknames so I really like that </i></p><p><i>You\u2019re a good person</i></p><p><i>I know it</i></p><p>Peter\u2019s writing flourishes on his palm almost faster than Tony can read them all and the tears come down harder when Peter doesn\u2019t seem to run out of things to say. He keeps pouring out love and Tony tries desperately to receive it and he thinks maybe he was wrong about what the universe had intended. Maybe he wasn\u2019t meant to save Peter, maybe Peter was meant to save him. Over and over, Peter tells him he can be good. That he <i>is</i> good. And Peter thinks of Tony and thinks about the power of the sun and the wind and the might of the ocean. Tony Stark can do anything and for the first time in his life, Tony believes it. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t feel like a good person. He doesn\u2019t feel anything but guilt and regret. But Peter thinks he\u2019s good. And for Peter, Tony would change the world. </p><p>Tony grits his teeth. Wipes his eyes. Gets up from the floor. He marches down to his lab, ready to unleash hell and turn the entire company around. This isn\u2019t the legacy he\u2019s going to leave behind. He\u2019s done with the world of war and blood. Peter is going to grow up in a world of peace. Tony will make sure of it. </p><p>It\u2019s all over the news the next day. </p><p>STARK INDUSTRIES SHAKEN BY SHOCKING REVELATIONS OF OBADIAH STANE\u2019S DEALS WITH TERRORISTS</p><p>TONY STARK, CEO OF STARK INDUSTRIES, EXPOSES STANE\u2019S WRONGDOING AT BOARD MEMBER\u2019S MEETING </p><p>STARK INDUSTRIES TO SHUT DOWN THE WEAPONS DIVISION EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY </p><p>TONY STARK, CRAZY? OR JUST STUPID? </p><p>CEO TONY STARK TAKES THE MANTLE OF SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE ENTERPRISE TOO SERIOUSLY? </p><p>The media can say whatever they want. They can call him crazy or stupid or the worst thing to happen to business since the housing bubble, but Tony doesn\u2019t care. Peter said he was a good person. And he intended on making sure he was right. </p><hr><p>It\u2019s three years later and Tony\u2019s been delighted with hearing the literal stream of consciousness from Peter over his first crush- a black haired girl named Lindsay,- his adventures in the world of Lego- ridiculous,- and every little dorky thing a nerd kid would get up to in his life. Bored at a meeting or needing a break from the mundane, Tony knows he can just glance at his hand for a good pick me up. </p><p>Peter\u2019s gotten better at controlling his thoughts now. Tony\u2019s hand is no longer an eternally marred canvas, but Peter\u2019s thoughts are still hilariously out of control. Which is why when the blue splatters across his hand Tony almost chuckles before he really reads what\u2019s going on.</p><p><i>No. No nonono no no nono please</i></p><p><i>Please please </i></p><p><i>Ben</i></p><p><i>Ben</i></p><p><i>Oh no </i></p><p><i>Please don\u2019t go please don\u2019t-</i></p><p>Tony\u2019s hand trembles. He clutches it in his left, unable to stop staring at the horror unfolding across his skin. Peter\u2019s in pain. Soul-mates can\u2019t feel each other but Tony can see Peter unraveling anyway. The writing smudges on his palm like Peter\u2019s barely coherent. Tony thinks he can make out the word \u2018no\u2019 and \u2018please\u2019 but mostly it\u2019s Ben\u2019s name, blurred on his hand like he\u2019s seeing through tears. </p><p><i>I need help</i></p><p><i>I need help</i></p><p><i>Someone help me please</i></p><p><i>HELP ME</i></p><p>Tony clenches his jaw, a frustrated growl in the back of his throat. Running, he surges into his lab, throwing himself onto his chair, fingers clattering against the keyboard. \u201cJARVIS call emergency responders tell them-\u201d Tony trails off. </p><p>Tell them what? That there\u2019s a kid somewhere crying about his uncle? Crying over what? What happened? Who else was there? More importantly, <i>where</i> was there. Tony\u2019s heart tremors, he sucks in a breath. He feels like his lungs have shrunk inside him. That the air\u2019s disappeared. His right hand is still on fire, the blue has now consumed his palm, there are barely any distinguishable words from how many of them there are and all Tony can do is press his hand to his lips and rock himself back and forth.</p><p><i>I\u2019m sorry</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m sorry</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m sorry Peter </i></p><p><i>God I\u2019m so sorry</i></p><p>He watches and waits for a hint, a sign, anything to help him know where Peter is and what happened, a hint, a kernel, just the <i>possibility</i> of being to help him. But the day darkens and Tony gets nothing. Not one useful thing. </p><p>Eventually, the blue melts away and it\u2019s replaced by just one sentence that stays even into the night. </p><p><i>Ben\u2019s dead. </i></p><p><i>My fault. </i></p><p>And Tony shakes. </p><hr><p><i>I don\u2019t want to do this</i></p><p><i>I can\u2019t do this</i></p><p><i>Please Tony</i></p><p><i>Please, please please </i></p><p><i>Make it go away </i></p><p><i>Make it stop </i></p><p><i>I can\u2019t do this</i></p><p>Today\u2019s the day of Ben\u2019s funeral and Tony scours the web for any sign of it, but with no last name, Ben dies with thousands of his name. </p><p>Tony focuses everything he has into crafting the perfect message. He wants to be there. Needs to be there. The second Peter\u2019s writing first appeared he had sworn that he would always look out for him, always be there for him, that he would be better than he ever could be because this was the universe giving him a second chance at love. </p><p><i>You can do it Peter</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re strong and you\u2019re kind and you loved your uncle</i></p><p><i>And he would want you there to see him off </i></p><p><i>And be with your aunt</i></p><p>Peter\u2019s reply is immediate. </p><p><i>It should\u2019ve been me</i></p><p>Tony knows he hadn\u2019t meant to let that slip out. He can tell from how it disappears the second it\u2019s written. But it\u2019s too late. The damage is done. </p><p><i>Don\u2019t say that</i></p><p>Tony doesn\u2019t even have to try and focus. He can\u2019t. Even if he wanted to. There\u2019s something fierce inside him. Something deep and primal and unwilling to ever let go. A desperate love he\u2019s never felt before. </p><p><i>Don\u2019t you ever say that</i></p><p>For the first time in a long time, his thoughts become a wave, they douse Peter\u2019s hand and he can\u2019t stop it.</p><p><i>Your life is worth more than you\u2019ll ever possibly know to your uncle</i></p><p><i>He loved you and he wanted you to live</i></p><p><i>Your life meant everything to him</i></p><p><i>I don\u2019t need to have met him to know that</i></p><p><i>And so now</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re going to go to the funeral</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re going to cry and you\u2019re going to mourn and hug your aunt</i></p><p><i>And then you\u2019re going to live</i></p><p><i>Do you hear me Peter?</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re going to LIVE</i></p><p><i>For your uncle</i></p><p><i>For Ben</i></p><p>And Tony\u2019s feelings are like tidal waves, he can\u2019t stop until he knows Peter understands. He\u2019s never even met the kid but he knows just as certainly as he knows anything in this world that if he were Ben, he would\u2019ve done the exact same thing. That loving someone you have to protect is stronger a force than anything on the planet and that Peter will get through this because he\u2019s still surrounded by love and Tony would make sure of it. </p><p>Unbidden, his thoughts come out before can stop them.</p><p><i>I\u2019m here for you. Now, later, forever. </i></p><p><i>I\u2019m going to find you soon </i></p><p><i>I promise </i></p><p><i>I\u2019m going to </i><b><i>find you</i></b></p><hr><p>Except\u2026Tony\u2019s already tried. He\u2019s tried so many times. But every attempt had failed and the failures were piling atop of him. Crushing and mocking. It\u2019s been months since the funeral and he\u2019s at the exact same place now as he was then. Pen twirling in his hand, Tony stops swiveling in his chair when there\u2019s a knock on his office door. </p><p>The sunlight streams through Pepper\u2019s hair like a halo and Tony\u2019s smile comes as naturally as breathing. \u201cHey Pep.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey yourself.\u201d she greets, an amused note in her wry smile, \u201cYou know you have a meeting in twenty minutes right?\u201d</p><p>Tony feigns surprise, \u201cWhat? Do I? Must\u2019ve slipped my mind.\u201d he makes a snide face, \u201cNo wait, I just decided it was boring and thought we could play hookie and go get coffee instead. My treat.\u201d he waggles his brows in that way he knew always made her laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou know that we\u2019re married and have a joint account right?\u201d but she grins anyway. \u201cActually, I need you to sign this.\u201d </p><p>Not even needing to look at it, Tony flips to the back, scrawling his name with a bit of a flourish. \u201cIs it possible this is even more boring than the meeting?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDepends.\u201d she shrugs, coy. </p><p>\u201cO-n?\u201d he says, dragging the word.</p><p>Something sparkles in Pepper\u2019s eyes, \u201cOn whether you think hosting a summer intern would be fun or not.\u201d</p><p>Tony groans, sliding in his seat. \u201cWhen did this happen? Is this because I missed dinner a week ago because I told you that Happy refused to listen when I said to avoid traffic and-\u201d</p><p>Pepper holds up a hand. \u201cNo.\u201d she says slowly, \u201cThis is because we\u2019re trying to encourage young minds remember? You know, this was technically your idea.\u201d </p><p>Tony looks aghast. \u201cHow dare you.\u201d </p><p>Laughing, Pepper sits across from him on his desk. \u201cRemember when you said it might be fun to host a competition for kids at the next Stark Expo? I thought we could host something for all ages, it would be cute right? To see a bunch of eight year olds walk in with volcanoes? And then I thought, what should the prize be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain how an internship is a prize.\u201d Tony says, expression flat.</p><p>\u201cWhat high school kid obsessed with tech <i>wouldn\u2019t </i>want to work with Tony Stark.\u201d</p><p>Tony smirks, lazy and slow. \u201cIs that a little hint of admiration I sense Miss. Potts?\u201d </p><p>Pepper smiles into his kiss. \u201cNot admiration, just shaking my head at all the misguided youth.\u201d </p><p>Quickly, she snatches up the papers from his desk. \u201cAnd you already signed anyway, so!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheater!!\u201d </p><p>\u201cAll\u2019s fair sweetie.\u201d And she flashes him that smug expression over her shoulder that makes him want to simultaneously kiss and her and sulk, \u201cAnd get up. The meeting\u2019s in five minutes!\u201d </p><p>Tony\u2019s hand burns. <i>She sure got the better of you huh?</i></p><p><i>Zip it kid</i></p><p>Tony shakes his head to hide his grin. </p><hr><p>The universe as it happened, brims with people destined to be together, but who only truly belonged together at a certain moment. Sometimes the people you love the fiercest are those who, in a different time, in a different place, in a different state of mind, you might never have come to love at all. And Tony\u2019s always loved Peter. From the second he knew he existed, he loved him. </p><p>But the right time. </p><p>The perfect time.</p><p>A time where Tony wasn\u2019t grieving and drinking and falling into pits of self-destruction and a time where Peter wasn\u2019t imploding on the inside with guilt and loss, a time where both of them could come into each other\u2019s lives at the perfect moment to acknowledge the worst but bring out the best had yet to come. And Tony\u2019s finally entered it. And he has never felt more afraid and yet, a deeper, intense need for anything ever before in his life. </p><p>The competition\u2019s started. There are three separate rooms, three separate groups. He enters the Kid\u2019s Corner, full of elementary school kids racing through the booths admiring projects their own parents helped them make. Tony takes photos and high-fives children and encourages one shy girl to give a presentation that makes him feel oddly misty. The second room has middle schoolers, probably the worst age group Tony can think of. Even Peter had his days when he was thirteen. And Peter was the sweetest thing since the sugarcane. To be honest, he\u2019s so busy navigating the crowds and playing the part that he doesn\u2019t really notice the burning in both his hands until he\u2019s standing outside the high schooler\u2019s room.</p><p>Pepper\u2019s cursive writing appears like art on his palm, she\u2019s running through her checklist, making sure everything\u2019s all set and good to go. It\u2019s such a small, common thing. But Tony can\u2019t help but think <i>I love you</i> anyway. Pepper always takes such good care of him. Sometimes he doesn\u2019t know if he deserves it. But he cherishes it anyway. </p><p>He looks to his right hand and furrows his brows, fond. The kid\u2019s freaking out. Nervous about presenting soon and that the lights are on him and there\u2019s no way he can compete with all these rich kids when he\u2019s a dumpster diver but it would be so cool to win the competition and-</p><p>Tony stops. No way. </p><p>No way.</p><p>It\u2019s- it\u2019s impossible.</p><p>But it isn\u2019t. It isn\u2019t impossible. And Tony bursts through the doors, eyes wide, muscles tight, his mouth is open like he wants to shout when the curtains draw open on the stage and everyone stops to stare and Tony stops with them. </p><p>He can barely breathe. </p><p>\u201cPresenting Peter Parker and his chemical invention.\u201d</p><p>Peter Parker. </p><p>Tony claps his hands to his mouth. Emotions bursting through every part of him. He can\u2019t take his eyes off him. Peter. Peter. It\u2019s Peter. Peter Parker. And he\u2019s wonderful. Boyish brown curls, a shy smile, the gangly teenage body that doesn\u2019t quite know how to hold itself in the world. \u201cHi- hi everyone, I\u2019m Peter Parker.\u201d </p><p>He sounds exactly like Tony\u2019s imagined. Young and polite and sweet. So sweet. He\u2019s perfect. He\u2019s absolutely perfect. And he\u2019s happy. And <i>Tony\u2019s</i> happy. So so so happy that he\u2019s here. And that today\u2019s the day. And that even if he doesn\u2019t get to meet him at least he got to see him and that\u2019s enough for Tony. It\u2019s enough. </p><p>But his thoughts must have been too loud. Too emotional and strung and so uncontainable he could power a thousand earths because Peter glances down at his own hand and his eyes widen. His head jerks up. Something like longing in the curve of his brows. Hope that he barely wants to believe. He scans the crowd. Tony and Peter lock eyes and he can tell the exact second that Peter realizes that Tony Stark is his soul-mate. His lip wobbles and he looks like he wants to jump into the crowd and run but Peter\u2019s a better kid than Tony ever was and he just shakes his head slightly, like he\u2019s laughing to himself, glances at his hand, <i>I\u2019m so proud of you</i>, and pushes through his presentation because he knows it has to be done and that they\u2019ll have time later. </p><p>Peter\u2019s brilliant on stage. More brilliant than Tony ever was and he knows that Peter will be even better with time. Peter finishes his speech with a shy duck of the head and the sweetest half smile that has Tony feeling endeared to him all over again where he\u2019s waiting in the wings. Peter catches his eye, smiling so uncontrollably it makes him beam and when the curtains close he launches in Tony\u2019s direction, throwing his arms around him like they\u2019d done this a million times. </p><p>The first time Tony spoke to Peter, he had cried from gratitude. The first time he got to hold him, his arms wrapped so tightly around him, feeling Peter\u2019s fingers around his shoulder, he buries his face in Peter\u2019s hair and feels that same gratefulness, that same adoration, that same love for the universe that loved him after all and showed him he could find and give love in return. </p><p>Tony and Peter hold each other tightly and on both their hands, <i>I finally found you</i>. </p>",

How could not everyone have a soul mate? That didn&rsquo;t seem fair. Was it because there weren&rsquo;t enough people? Or was it because some people are just impossible to love at all? </p>\n<p>Tony&rsquo;s voice was small, insecure and anxious, &ldquo;Will I get soul-mates?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Maria gathered him in her arms, pressing kisses into his hair. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask questions like that Tony, soul-mates or not, everyone deserves love.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>He wouldn&rsquo;t notice until much later that she never really answered his question.

Some people aren\u2019t so lucky.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s frown deepened, a small kernel of anxiety clustering in his stomach, only to grow bigger with time. How could not everyone have a soul mate? That didn\u2019t seem fair. Was it because there weren\u2019t enough people? Or was it because some people are just impossible to love at all? </p><p>Tony\u2019s voice was small, insecure and anxious, \u201cWill I get soul-mates?\u201d</p><p>Maria gathered him in her arms, pressing kisses into his hair. \u201cDon\u2019t ask questions like that Tony, soul-mates or not, everyone deserves love.\u201d </p><p>He wouldn\u2019t notice until much later that she never really answered his question. Maybe she had known, even then, that he would be difficult to love. </p>[[MORE]]<p>The day Tony turns ten years old is the most exciting day of his life. He falls asleep when he\u2019s still nine and knows that at 4:35 a.m, the exact time he was born, the writing will appear on his right hand. Whichever person turns ten first triggers the writing for both pairs. If he\u2019s being honest, he\u2019s more excited about his platonic soul-mate than the romantic one. Romance was icky and looked like hard work. Who wanted to always buy flowers all the time? </p><p>The clock ticks its way past ten-thirty p.m, a long time after his bed time. Flipping on his stomach, Tony reaches for his alarm clock, turning the dials to set the alarm for exactly 4:35 a.m. Burying himself into his pillows, Tony waits for the earth to turn. He can\u2019t wait. He just can\u2019t wait. Maybe now he wouldn\u2019t be so lonely all the time. Because now he\u2019d find a best friend <i>and</i> a wife and isn\u2019t that the best combination ever? That\u2019s more than Tony ever wanted. </p><p>He was just tired of being lonely. </p><p>Tony drifts off in a hazy dream. He thinks he catches a glimpse of a little girl with strawberry blonde hair. She looks really pretty. He wakes up before his alarm by only a second, a light burning sensation in his left hand tingling. Tony\u2019s eyes widen, heart battering in this throat as he throws himself off the bed to turn on the lights, watching as a white script with almost curly lettering traces itself along his palm. </p><p><i>Cotton candy rain</i></p><p>Tony furrows his brows before remembering what time it is. Smiling to himself, he watches in fascination as the scope of his soul-mate\u2019s dreams change. So this is the person he would marry? She seems really cute. </p><p>But something bothers him. His right hand isn\u2019t tingling. He scrubs at his palm as though that had anything to do with the process at all but it remains just as blank. That kernel of anxiety pounds into something bigger. Something like dread coiling around it. He has one soul-mate, where\u2019s the other? Why aren\u2019t they connected to him yet? </p><p>Does he just not have one? </p><p>Tony thinks about what will be on his romantic soul-mate\u2019s palm. All the scared thoughts rumbling inside his head. The fears. The insecurities. Immediately, he tries to think of better things. What if she wakes up and thinks those bad things are all about her?? She\u2019d hate him before he ever gets the chance to meet her. And Tony really wants to meet her. More than he wants anything. </p><p>Maybe his platonic soul-mate just comes later. </p><p>Yeah. Maybe that\u2019s it. </p><hr><p>Tony\u2019s platonic soul-mate never comes. </p><p>He\u2019s eighteen now and knows two things. One, Pepper- they couldn\u2019t share their real names- was his soul-mate and he loves her more than anything even though he hasn\u2019t met her yet. Two, he doesn\u2019t need a platonic soul mate or anyone else in the world because he has Rhodey and Rhodey is enough for him. </p><p>The white script flows over his hand, <i>Say I\u2019m just a girl one more time. </i></p><p>Tony winces. He would <i>not</i> want to be the sorry asshole on the other side of that conversation. Without even meaning to, Tony checks his other hand and even though it hasn\u2019t changed in eight years, the blankness still hurts him somewhere farther down than he could hide. His mother tries to tell him that maybe his soul-mate just wasn\u2019t born yet. But Tony knows the truth. He just doesn\u2019t get one. Isn\u2019t worthy of one. Pepper\u2019s just a fluke, some kind of cosmic karma taunting him about how he shouldn\u2019t have any soul-mates, let alone the most wonderful woman in the world. That it\u2019s all just an accident he doesn\u2019t deserve. </p><p><i>Hey. Stop that Tony. I deserve you and only you. </i></p><p>Tony stares at the words, wishing he could brand them on his skin forever. Usually the thoughts appeared automatically, but over the years, Tony and Pepper had learned that if they concentrated hard enough, they could craft their own messages. Tony doesn\u2019t have to try though, for his most sincere appreciation to shine through. \u00a0</p><p>But he knows the truth. His father stopped talking to him the moment he left home, tired of him and unwilling to put up with him. His old socialite circle was grandiose and bursting at the seams, lies upon lies piling up over gossip and half-meant kisses. Even Obadiah, mentor that he was, was never really there when he needed him. Everyone around Tony either loved him and then left him, or never really loved him at all. </p><hr><p>Tony takes over Stark Industries and out of habit, looked down at his right hand and thought this has to be the day. This has to be. But as usual, his skin remains unchanged and he honestly doesn\u2019t know how he can still feel so disappointed every time. He\u2019s hosting interviews today, for the position of his assistant and he\u2019s already tired and really can\u2019t care less. </p><p>And then Virginia Potts walks into the room. \u00a0</p><p>Tony doesn\u2019t know how he knows. Maybe it\u2019s the white blazer suit, the one she had thought about in a choice between it and the blue one. Maybe it\u2019s the crimson writing on her palm she had told him was his colour. Or maybe it\u2019s the way she looks at him that makes him feel like he\u2019s known her his whole life. </p><p>\u201cYou wanna know something really weird?\u201d he asks, smiling at her taken aback expression.</p><p>\u201cDepends.\u201d she answers slowly.</p><p>\u201cI only have one soul-mate and it\u2019s this girl who has Maroon 5 stuck in her head so much my entire hand is just She Will Be Loved lyrics.\u201d </p><p>She pauses, narrowing her eyes like she almost doesn\u2019t want to believe it. \u201cThat\u2019s weird. My soul-mate always complains about the same thing as though heavy metal is any better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-the peak of music.\u201d they say together, and Tony gapes.</p><p>Pepper smiles. \u201cSo I\u2019ve been told anyway.\u201d </p><p>Pepper lifts her hand, showing Tony his own thoughts. <i>Oh my God it\u2019s her. She\u2019s beautiful.</i></p><p>When he runs to hug her, he tries not to let anything ruin the joy coursing through him, even when he catches a glimpse of bright green hand-writing on Pepper\u2019s other hand <i>YOU FOUND YOUR SOUL-MATE AHHHH!!!</i></p><p>Tony doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever felt happier than kissing Pepper for the first time. And yet he still feels half-way happy. Missing some crucial part of himself that he was robbed of. </p><p>But Tony has Pepper. </p><p>Maybe that could be enough. </p><hr><p>On August 10, everything changes. </p><p>Tony\u2019s forty-one now. He\u2019s married Pepper, a small quiet wedding with just their closest circles. Stark Industries has delved into automated weaponry, and despite everything, Tony\u2019s come to terms now, finally, that he can still be loved even without any writing on his right hand. </p><p>He\u2019s making a sandwich to bring back down to the lab when his right hand burns. Jolting, he drops the knife with a hiss, bringing his hand up to see where he had cut it when he freezes. It\u2019s impossible. It\u2019s utterly impossible but- scratchy blue writing scrawls across his hand, <i>!!!!!</i>. </p><p>Tony\u2019s hand shakes. No. There\u2019s no- there\u2019s no way. Thirty years later, there\u2019s no way- there just- there just isn\u2019t- but the words keep changing, faster and faster. <i>I have a soul-mate. Oh my god! Oh my God! Wow! I have TWO soul-mates! </i></p><p>Tony feels his eyes warm with disbelief, tears pooling at the edge of his lashes. He can\u2019t stop staring at the blue writing curving all around his hand as his soul-mate\u2019s thoughts get more and more out of control. Pepper\u2019s thoughts had always been more constrained, elegant almost, even when they were kids. But whoever\u2019s thoughts are on his hand jumps from one idea to the next, a flurry of energy and vitality that brings up every repressed emotion Tony had hidden deep inside come flooding to the surface.</p><p>He has a soul-mate. He has a soul-mate. They appeared for him. He isn\u2019t unloved. He isn\u2019t a flaw in the universe. He\u2019s- he\u2019s whole. </p><p>The tears wash down his cheeks as Tony closes his eyes, bringing his hands up to his face. His whole life, he had felt like some part of him was missing. That there was something he was supposed to be looking for. And now- </p><p><i>Don\u2019t be sad anymore. Your writing is so sad.</i></p><p>Tony\u2019s mouth trembles. The writing shifting again, <i>How do I cheer them up? A joke? </i></p><p>Two seconds later, <i>I don\u2019t know any jokes though\u2026maybe Ben knows some!</i></p><p>Unprompted, the only thought in Tony\u2019s head is, <i>I don\u2019t even know who this person is, but I love them.</i></p><p><i>I love you too!!</i></p><p>And this time, Tony allows himself to laugh, incredulous and thankful. He\u2019s forty-one when his platonic soul-mate sends their first message. His mother was right, Tony had just needed to wait. The universe had never abandoned it him. It was just waiting to give him the perfect person. But this kid\u2026how can Tony be perfect for him? How can he possibly be deserving of being in a child\u2019s life? A kid so happy it\u2019s almost contagious. </p><p>What is a soul-mate? A person whose atoms are made up from the same star you were born from? A person who has one half of your very own soul? A person you never abandon, no matter what? Maybe the universe gave this kid to Tony to prove he still has love to give in a way he never thought he could have. But maybe one day, this child would need him. Maybe not right now, maybe not that second, but sometime, in the future, they would meet, and Tony knows he\u2019s going to spend every moment trying to make that happen and be there for this kid. </p><p><i>I can\u2019t wait to meet you. </i>He can\u2019t help but think.</p><p><i>Me too! I live at</i></p><p>The text cuts off and Tony smiles in spite of himself. He doesn\u2019t know the tricks of the trade yet and it was somehow more endearing than it should\u2019ve been.</p><p><i>You can\u2019t say anything personal except your name yet kiddo </i></p><p><i>That\u2019s dumb. Rules are dumb. Super duper dumb.</i></p><p>Tony snorts. The kid\u2019ll learn to control his thoughts more one day, but as it is, it\u2019s adorable watching him. Tony takes in a breath, still unable to help his smile. He concentrates his thoughts. </p><p><i>I\u2019m Tony</i>. </p><p><i>My name\u2019s Peter! Do I get to meet you soon?? </i></p><p><i>I want to meet you.</i></p><p><i>Is that weird to say?</i></p><p><i>Oh no, you\u2019re gonna see everything I think. </i></p><p><i>Tony!!</i></p><p>Tony bursts out laughing and he doesn\u2019t know how his entire heart can expand until its swelled with adoration over someone he hasn\u2019t met yet. </p><p><i>!!!</i></p><p><i>That\u2019s so nice</i></p><p><i>Wow</i></p><p>Embarrassed, Tony quickly quiets his mind. No need to traumatize the kid with all his issues and troubles with love. </p><p><i>When you\u2019re older, you\u2019ll get better at only letting certain thoughts appear</i></p><p><i>Wait are you old? My soul-mate\u2019s old??</i></p><p><i>I didn\u2019t know that could happen</i></p><p><i>Hey-</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m old, but not that old </i></p><p>Peter keeps on chattering and Tony counts down the days before the universe brings them together.</p><hr><p>It\u2019s a while later, after Peter\u2019s next birthday- his excitement made Tony smile- when Tony finds out just how deep Obadiah\u2019s betrayal went. He sees the files upon files of under the table deals. Weapons sold to terrorists and warlords and profiteers of senseless violence and death. He traces each deal to an attack that killed more innocents than he could count from all parts of the globe. Stark Industries wasn\u2019t protecting anybody. They were tools of murder. </p><p>Tony can\u2019t move. He\u2019s frozen in his chair. He\u2019s<b> </b>the CEO, he\u2019s the one in charge, he\u2019s the one who had been duped all these years by that lying, two-faced son of a bitch. Shit. He really is the worst. Scum. Garbage. How many people died because of him? How much blood is on his hands? What could he have done better- god it was always about what he could\u2019ve done better. Always playing catch up. </p><p>He thought he was the good guy. Turns out he\u2019d been the villain all along. The universe was wrong. He isn\u2019t worthy of love. He doesn\u2019t deserve it. Smartest man alive. Kid genius. The most brilliant mind of our generation. All that means nothing if he can\u2019t use that so called genius for anything that <b>matters</b>.</p><p>Tony\u2019s head falls into his hands and he shakes. There are no tears. No sobs. He just trembles under the weight of everything he could\u2019ve done differently and wishes he could shake hard enough for everything inside of him to fall right out so his guilt doesn\u2019t consume him whole. He should\u2019ve been better. He should\u2019ve been better. </p><p>His right hand burns. </p><p>It stings with such a fierce intensity that it jerks him out of his self-pity. He stares at the blue writing, usually messily scrawled and quick, now bold and in all capitals, looking crisp and authoritative. </p><p><i>You are not a bad person</i></p><p><i>You are not a bad person</i></p><p><i>You are not a bad person</i></p><p>Every time the thought seems to disappear, the words come back bolder, like Peter\u2019s focusing desperately on keeping that one thought coherent. Demanding Tony to read it. Demanding he accept it. Tony watches as Peter battles with his constant stream of ideas to present just this one and he can imagine a little boy, scrunching his face in concentration, clutching his wrist, working so damn <i>hard</i> so that someone like <i>Tony </i>would hear him. </p><p>The tears finally well up in his eyes and Tony can\u2019t help but feel worse because here he was bringing this little kid down. The kid Tony promised to protect is trying to protect him and he really is the <i>worst</i>. </p><p><i>Not the worst. </i></p><p><i>You\u2019re the best Tony</i></p><p><i>The best the best the best </i></p><p><i>I\u2019m your soul mate so I\u2019ll love you forever even if you don\u2019t love yourself yet</i></p><p><i>May says sometimes that takes a while </i></p><p><i>But I\u2019ll tell you everything I love about you</i></p><p><i>Because you\u2019re good </i></p><p><i>You\u2019re good Tony, you\u2019re good</i></p><p><i>You made good jokes</i></p><p><i>You give me better advice than Ned</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re so smart! Sometimes I see words I don\u2019t even know how to say on my hand and I\u2019m like woahhh!!</i></p><p><i>And you always say nice things to me</i></p><p><i>And you give me funny nicknames</i></p><p><i>No one gives me nicknames so I really like that </i></p><p><i>You\u2019re a good person</i></p><p><i>I know it</i></p><p>Peter\u2019s writing flourishes on his palm almost faster than Tony can read them all and the tears come down harder when Peter doesn\u2019t seem to run out of things to say. He keeps pouring out love and Tony tries desperately to receive it and he thinks maybe he was wrong about what the universe had intended. Maybe he wasn\u2019t meant to save Peter, maybe Peter was meant to save him. Over and over, Peter tells him he can be good. That he <i>is</i> good. And Peter thinks of Tony and thinks about the power of the sun and the wind and the might of the ocean. Tony Stark can do anything and for the first time in his life, Tony believes it. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t feel like a good person. He doesn\u2019t feel anything but guilt and regret. But Peter thinks he\u2019s good. And for Peter, Tony would change the world. </p><p>Tony grits his teeth. Wipes his eyes. Gets up from the floor. He marches down to his lab, ready to unleash hell and turn the entire company around. This isn\u2019t the legacy he\u2019s going to leave behind. He\u2019s done with the world of war and blood. Peter is going to grow up in a world of peace. Tony will make sure of it. </p><p>It\u2019s all over the news the next day. </p><p>STARK INDUSTRIES SHAKEN BY SHOCKING REVELATIONS OF OBADIAH STANE\u2019S DEALS WITH TERRORISTS</p><p>TONY STARK, CEO OF STARK INDUSTRIES, EXPOSES STANE\u2019S WRONGDOING AT BOARD MEMBER\u2019S MEETING </p><p>STARK INDUSTRIES TO SHUT DOWN THE WEAPONS DIVISION EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY </p><p>TONY STARK, CRAZY? OR JUST STUPID? </p><p>CEO TONY STARK TAKES THE MANTLE OF SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE ENTERPRISE TOO SERIOUSLY? </p><p>The media can say whatever they want. They can call him crazy or stupid or the worst thing to happen to business since the housing bubble, but Tony doesn\u2019t care. Peter said he was a good person. And he intended on making sure he was right. </p><hr><p>It\u2019s three years later and Tony\u2019s been delighted with hearing the literal stream of consciousness from Peter over his first crush- a black haired girl named Lindsay,- his adventures in the world of Lego- ridiculous,- and every little dorky thing a nerd kid would get up to in his life. Bored at a meeting or needing a break from the mundane, Tony knows he can just glance at his hand for a good pick me up. </p><p>Peter\u2019s gotten better at controlling his thoughts now. Tony\u2019s hand is no longer an eternally marred canvas, but Peter\u2019s thoughts are still hilariously out of control. Which is why when the blue splatters across his hand Tony almost chuckles before he really reads what\u2019s going on.</p><p><i>No. No nonono no no nono please</i></p><p><i>Please please </i></p><p><i>Ben</i></p><p><i>Ben</i></p><p><i>Oh no </i></p><p><i>Please don\u2019t go please don\u2019t-</i></p><p>Tony\u2019s hand trembles. He clutches it in his left, unable to stop staring at the horror unfolding across his skin. Peter\u2019s in pain. Soul-mates can\u2019t feel each other but Tony can see Peter unraveling anyway. The writing smudges on his palm like Peter\u2019s barely coherent. Tony thinks he can make out the word \u2018no\u2019 and \u2018please\u2019 but mostly it\u2019s Ben\u2019s name, blurred on his hand like he\u2019s seeing through tears. </p><p><i>I need help</i></p><p><i>I need help</i></p><p><i>Someone help me please</i></p><p><i>HELP ME</i></p><p>Tony clenches his jaw, a frustrated growl in the back of his throat. Running, he surges into his lab, throwing himself onto his chair, fingers clattering against the keyboard. \u201cJARVIS call emergency responders tell them-\u201d Tony trails off. </p><p>Tell them what? That there\u2019s a kid somewhere crying about his uncle? Crying over what? What happened? Who else was there? More importantly, <i>where</i> was there. Tony\u2019s heart tremors, he sucks in a breath. He feels like his lungs have shrunk inside him. That the air\u2019s disappeared. His right hand is still on fire, the blue has now consumed his palm, there are barely any distinguishable words from how many of them there are and all Tony can do is press his hand to his lips and rock himself back and forth.</p><p><i>I\u2019m sorry</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m sorry</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m sorry Peter </i></p><p><i>God I\u2019m so sorry</i></p><p>He watches and waits for a hint, a sign, anything to help him know where Peter is and what happened, a hint, a kernel, just the <i>possibility</i> of being to help him. But the day darkens and Tony gets nothing. Not one useful thing. </p><p>Eventually, the blue melts away and it\u2019s replaced by just one sentence that stays even into the night. </p><p><i>Ben\u2019s dead. </i></p><p><i>My fault. </i></p><p>And Tony shakes. </p><hr><p><i>I don\u2019t want to do this</i></p><p><i>I can\u2019t do this</i></p><p><i>Please Tony</i></p><p><i>Please, please please </i></p><p><i>Make it go away </i></p><p><i>Make it stop </i></p><p><i>I can\u2019t do this</i></p><p>Today\u2019s the day of Ben\u2019s funeral and Tony scours the web for any sign of it, but with no last name, Ben dies with thousands of his name. </p><p>Tony focuses everything he has into crafting the perfect message. He wants to be there. Needs to be there. The second Peter\u2019s writing first appeared he had sworn that he would always look out for him, always be there for him, that he would be better than he ever could be because this was the universe giving him a second chance at love. </p><p><i>You can do it Peter</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re strong and you\u2019re kind and you loved your uncle</i></p><p><i>And he would want you there to see him off </i></p><p><i>And be with your aunt</i></p><p>Peter\u2019s reply is immediate. </p><p><i>It should\u2019ve been me</i></p><p>Tony knows he hadn\u2019t meant to let that slip out. He can tell from how it disappears the second it\u2019s written. But it\u2019s too late. The damage is done. </p><p><i>Don\u2019t say that</i></p><p>Tony doesn\u2019t even have to try and focus. He can\u2019t. Even if he wanted to. There\u2019s something fierce inside him. Something deep and primal and unwilling to ever let go. A desperate love he\u2019s never felt before. </p><p><i>Don\u2019t you ever say that</i></p><p>For the first time in a long time, his thoughts become a wave, they douse Peter\u2019s hand and he can\u2019t stop it.</p><p><i>Your life is worth more than you\u2019ll ever possibly know to your uncle</i></p><p><i>He loved you and he wanted you to live</i></p><p><i>Your life meant everything to him</i></p><p><i>I don\u2019t need to have met him to know that</i></p><p><i>And so now</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re going to go to the funeral</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re going to cry and you\u2019re going to mourn and hug your aunt</i></p><p><i>And then you\u2019re going to live</i></p><p><i>Do you hear me Peter?</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re going to LIVE</i></p><p><i>For your uncle</i></p><p><i>For Ben</i></p><p>And Tony\u2019s feelings are like tidal waves, he can\u2019t stop until he knows Peter understands. He\u2019s never even met the kid but he knows just as certainly as he knows anything in this world that if he were Ben, he would\u2019ve done the exact same thing. That loving someone you have to protect is stronger a force than anything on the planet and that Peter will get through this because he\u2019s still surrounded by love and Tony would make sure of it. </p><p>Unbidden, his thoughts come out before can stop them.</p><p><i>I\u2019m here for you. Now, later, forever. </i></p><p><i>I\u2019m going to find you soon </i></p><p><i>I promise </i></p><p><i>I\u2019m going to </i><b><i>find you</i></b></p><hr><p>Except\u2026Tony\u2019s already tried. He\u2019s tried so many times. But every attempt had failed and the failures were piling atop of him. Crushing and mocking. It\u2019s been months since the funeral and he\u2019s at the exact same place now as he was then. Pen twirling in his hand, Tony stops swiveling in his chair when there\u2019s a knock on his office door. </p><p>The sunlight streams through Pepper\u2019s hair like a halo and Tony\u2019s smile comes as naturally as breathing. \u201cHey Pep.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey yourself.\u201d she greets, an amused note in her wry smile, \u201cYou know you have a meeting in twenty minutes right?\u201d</p><p>Tony feigns surprise, \u201cWhat? Do I? Must\u2019ve slipped my mind.\u201d he makes a snide face, \u201cNo wait, I just decided it was boring and thought we could play hookie and go get coffee instead. My treat.\u201d he waggles his brows in that way he knew always made her laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou know that we\u2019re married and have a joint account right?\u201d but she grins anyway. \u201cActually, I need you to sign this.\u201d </p><p>Not even needing to look at it, Tony flips to the back, scrawling his name with a bit of a flourish. \u201cIs it possible this is even more boring than the meeting?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDepends.\u201d she shrugs, coy. </p><p>\u201cO-n?\u201d he says, dragging the word.</p><p>Something sparkles in Pepper\u2019s eyes, \u201cOn whether you think hosting a summer intern would be fun or not.\u201d</p><p>Tony groans, sliding in his seat. \u201cWhen did this happen? Is this because I missed dinner a week ago because I told you that Happy refused to listen when I said to avoid traffic and-\u201d</p><p>Pepper holds up a hand. \u201cNo.\u201d she says slowly, \u201cThis is because we\u2019re trying to encourage young minds remember? You know, this was technically your idea.\u201d </p><p>Tony looks aghast. \u201cHow dare you.\u201d </p><p>Laughing, Pepper sits across from him on his desk. \u201cRemember when you said it might be fun to host a competition for kids at the next Stark Expo? I thought we could host something for all ages, it would be cute right? To see a bunch of eight year olds walk in with volcanoes? And then I thought, what should the prize be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain how an internship is a prize.\u201d Tony says, expression flat.</p><p>\u201cWhat high school kid obsessed with tech <i>wouldn\u2019t </i>want to work with Tony Stark.\u201d</p><p>Tony smirks, lazy and slow. \u201cIs that a little hint of admiration I sense Miss. Potts?\u201d </p><p>Pepper smiles into his kiss. \u201cNot admiration, just shaking my head at all the misguided youth.\u201d </p><p>Quickly, she snatches up the papers from his desk. \u201cAnd you already signed anyway, so!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheater!!\u201d </p><p>\u201cAll\u2019s fair sweetie.\u201d And she flashes him that smug expression over her shoulder that makes him want to simultaneously kiss and her and sulk, \u201cAnd get up. The meeting\u2019s in five minutes!\u201d </p><p>Tony\u2019s hand burns. <i>She sure got the better of you huh?</i></p><p><i>Zip it kid</i></p><p>Tony shakes his head to hide his grin. </p><hr><p>The universe as it happened, brims with people destined to be together, but who only truly belonged together at a certain moment. Sometimes the people you love the fiercest are those who, in a different time, in a different place, in a different state of mind, you might never have come to love at all. And Tony\u2019s always loved Peter. From the second he knew he existed, he loved him. </p><p>But the right time. </p><p>The perfect time.</p><p>A time where Tony wasn\u2019t grieving and drinking and falling into pits of self-destruction and a time where Peter wasn\u2019t imploding on the inside with guilt and loss, a time where both of them could come into each other\u2019s lives at the perfect moment to acknowledge the worst but bring out the best had yet to come. And Tony\u2019s finally entered it. And he has never felt more afraid and yet, a deeper, intense need for anything ever before in his life. </p><p>The competition\u2019s started. There are three separate rooms, three separate groups. He enters the Kid\u2019s Corner, full of elementary school kids racing through the booths admiring projects their own parents helped them make. Tony takes photos and high-fives children and encourages one shy girl to give a presentation that makes him feel oddly misty. The second room has middle schoolers, probably the worst age group Tony can think of. Even Peter had his days when he was thirteen. And Peter was the sweetest thing since the sugarcane. To be honest, he\u2019s so busy navigating the crowds and playing the part that he doesn\u2019t really notice the burning in both his hands until he\u2019s standing outside the high schooler\u2019s room.</p><p>Pepper\u2019s cursive writing appears like art on his palm, she\u2019s running through her checklist, making sure everything\u2019s all set and good to go. It\u2019s such a small, common thing. But Tony can\u2019t help but think <i>I love you</i> anyway. Pepper always takes such good care of him. Sometimes he doesn\u2019t know if he deserves it. But he cherishes it anyway. </p><p>He looks to his right hand and furrows his brows, fond. The kid\u2019s freaking out. Nervous about presenting soon and that the lights are on him and there\u2019s no way he can compete with all these rich kids when he\u2019s a dumpster diver but it would be so cool to win the competition and-</p><p>Tony stops. No way. </p><p>No way.</p><p>It\u2019s- it\u2019s impossible.</p><p>But it isn\u2019t. It isn\u2019t impossible. And Tony bursts through the doors, eyes wide, muscles tight, his mouth is open like he wants to shout when the curtains draw open on the stage and everyone stops to stare and Tony stops with them. </p><p>He can barely breathe. </p><p>\u201cPresenting Peter Parker and his chemical invention.\u201d</p><p>Peter Parker. </p><p>Tony claps his hands to his mouth. Emotions bursting through every part of him. He can\u2019t take his eyes off him. Peter. Peter. It\u2019s Peter. Peter Parker. And he\u2019s wonderful. Boyish brown curls, a shy smile, the gangly teenage body that doesn\u2019t quite know how to hold itself in the world. \u201cHi- hi everyone, I\u2019m Peter Parker.\u201d </p><p>He sounds exactly like Tony\u2019s imagined. Young and polite and sweet. So sweet. He\u2019s perfect. He\u2019s absolutely perfect. And he\u2019s happy. And <i>Tony\u2019s</i> happy. So so so happy that he\u2019s here. And that today\u2019s the day. And that even if he doesn\u2019t get to meet him at least he got to see him and that\u2019s enough for Tony. It\u2019s enough. </p><p>But his thoughts must have been too loud. Too emotional and strung and so uncontainable he could power a thousand earths because Peter glances down at his own hand and his eyes widen. His head jerks up. Something like longing in the curve of his brows. Hope that he barely wants to believe. He scans the crowd. Tony and Peter lock eyes and he can tell the exact second that Peter realizes that Tony Stark is his soul-mate. His lip wobbles and he looks like he wants to jump into the crowd and run but Peter\u2019s a better kid than Tony ever was and he just shakes his head slightly, like he\u2019s laughing to himself, glances at his hand, <i>I\u2019m so proud of you</i>, and pushes through his presentation because he knows it has to be done and that they\u2019ll have time later. </p><p>Peter\u2019s brilliant on stage. More brilliant than Tony ever was and he knows that Peter will be even better with time. Peter finishes his speech with a shy duck of the head and the sweetest half smile that has Tony feeling endeared to him all over again where he\u2019s waiting in the wings. Peter catches his eye, smiling so uncontrollably it makes him beam and when the curtains close he launches in Tony\u2019s direction, throwing his arms around him like they\u2019d done this a million times. </p><p>The first time Tony spoke to Peter, he had cried from gratitude. The first time he got to hold him, his arms wrapped so tightly around him, feeling Peter\u2019s fingers around his shoulder, he buries his face in Peter\u2019s hair and feels that same gratefulness, that same adoration, that same love for the universe that loved him after all and showed him he could find and give love in return. </p><p>Tony and Peter hold each other tightly and on both their hands, <i>I finally found you</i>. </p></p>",

Your platonic soul mate on your right. Your romantic soul mate on your left. But Tony\u2019s always known he\u2019s impossible to love. He only gets one. Until Peter.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/18842041\" target=\"_blank\">Link on AO3</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_Pac2IO3jaVcq1pmOXvcQg\" target=\"_blank\">@irondadbingo</a></b></p><hr><p>When Tony was young, he loved to watch the colours dance across his mother\u2019s palms. On her right hand, a bright orange that changed almost every moment, quick and fleeting. Sometimes there\u2019d be little drawings, detailed pounding hearts or sloppily constructed portraits. While the orange script vanished and reappeared as a constant, Maria\u2019s left hand stayed static, the same dark blue writing having never changed in over twelve years. </p><p>Head perched in his mother\u2019s lap, Tony played with her hands, marveling quietly at the contrast. \u201cMama, why don\u2019t the red thoughts change anymore?\u201d </p><p>Maria pulled her hand back, rubbing her palm with her thumb, almost tracing the words. Tony was old enough to read now. He could see the words <i>I wish I could have met you</i> clearly, written almost like it was scribbled in a rush all along her hand. </p><p>Immediately, the orange writing changed: <i>Don\u2019t be sad, I hate it when you\u2019re sad</i>. Tony pulled away. Had he upset mama? But quickly, Maria rushed to gather him in her arms, holding him tight. \u201cTony, you remember what the writing means right?\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded, still trying to figure out whether he had upset his mother or not. \u201cThe right hand is your soul mate who\u2019s your best friend and the left is your soul mate that you marry.\u201d</p><p>Maria smiled, pinching his cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s right. And do you remember why the words always change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s their most important thought.\u201d he answered, proud when his mother nodded.</p><p>\u201cBut sometimes\u2026\u201d her voice trailed off, locked in a pain Tony didn\u2019t yet understand, \u201csometimes the words stay frozen because that\u2019s the person\u2019s last thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can someone stop thinking?\u201d Tony scrunched his nose. </p><p>He knew for sure that could never happen to him. Even when he didn\u2019t want them, his thoughts raced faster than even he could keep up with sometimes. Maria looked down at her hand. \u201cSometimes your soul mate dies.\u201d she says quietly, \u201cAnd the last thing they ever thought stays on your skin forever.\u201d </p><p>Tony frowned. \u201cBut your soul-mate is supposed to <i>be</i> with you forever.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAt least I had a soul-mate Tony. Some people aren\u2019t so lucky.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s frown deepened, a small kernel of anxiety clustering in his stomach, only to grow bigger with time. How could not everyone have a soul mate? That didn\u2019t seem fair. Was it because there weren\u2019t enough people? Or was it because some people are just impossible to love at all? </p><p>Tony\u2019s voice was small, insecure and anxious, \u201cWill I get soul-mates?\u201d</p><p>Maria gathered him in her arms, pressing kisses into his hair. \u201cDon\u2019t ask questions like that Tony, soul-mates or not, everyone deserves love.\u201d </p><p>He wouldn\u2019t notice until much later that she never really answered his question. Maybe she had known, even then, that he would be difficult to love. </p>[[MORE]]<p>The day Tony turns ten years old is the most exciting day of his life. He falls asleep when he\u2019s still nine and knows that at 4:35 a.m, the exact time he was born, the writing will appear on his right hand. Whichever person turns ten first triggers the writing for both pairs. If he\u2019s being honest, he\u2019s more excited about his platonic soul-mate than the romantic one. Romance was icky and looked like hard work. Who wanted to always buy flowers all the time? </p><p>The clock ticks its way past ten-thirty p.m, a long time after his bed time. Flipping on his stomach, Tony reaches for his alarm clock, turning the dials to set the alarm for exactly 4:35 a.m. Burying himself into his pillows, Tony waits for the earth to turn. He can\u2019t wait. He just can\u2019t wait. Maybe now he wouldn\u2019t be so lonely all the time. Because now he\u2019d find a best friend <i>and</i> a wife and isn\u2019t that the best combination ever? That\u2019s more than Tony ever wanted. </p><p>He was just tired of being lonely. </p><p>Tony drifts off in a hazy dream. He thinks he catches a glimpse of a little girl with strawberry blonde hair. She looks really pretty. He wakes up before his alarm by only a second, a light burning sensation in his left hand tingling. Tony\u2019s eyes widen, heart battering in this throat as he throws himself off the bed to turn on the lights, watching as a white script with almost curly lettering traces itself along his palm. </p><p><i>Cotton candy rain</i></p><p>Tony furrows his brows before remembering what time it is. Smiling to himself, he watches in fascination as the scope of his soul-mate\u2019s dreams change. So this is the person he would marry? She seems really cute. </p><p>But something bothers him. His right hand isn\u2019t tingling. He scrubs at his palm as though that had anything to do with the process at all but it remains just as blank. That kernel of anxiety pounds into something bigger. Something like dread coiling around it. He has one soul-mate, where\u2019s the other? Why aren\u2019t they connected to him yet? </p><p>Does he just not have one? </p><p>Tony thinks about what will be on his romantic soul-mate\u2019s palm. All the scared thoughts rumbling inside his head. The fears. The insecurities. Immediately, he tries to think of better things. What if she wakes up and thinks those bad things are all about her?? She\u2019d hate him before he ever gets the chance to meet her. And Tony really wants to meet her. More than he wants anything. </p><p>Maybe his platonic soul-mate just comes later. </p><p>Yeah. Maybe that\u2019s it. </p><hr><p>Tony\u2019s platonic soul-mate never comes. </p><p>He\u2019s eighteen now and knows two things. One, Pepper- they couldn\u2019t share their real names- was his soul-mate and he loves her more than anything even though he hasn\u2019t met her yet. Two, he doesn\u2019t need a platonic soul mate or anyone else in the world because he has Rhodey and Rhodey is enough for him. </p><p>The white script flows over his hand, <i>Say I\u2019m just a girl one more time. </i></p><p>Tony winces. He would <i>not</i> want to be the sorry asshole on the other side of that conversation. Without even meaning to, Tony checks his other hand and even though it hasn\u2019t changed in eight years, the blankness still hurts him somewhere farther down than he could hide. His mother tries to tell him that maybe his soul-mate just wasn\u2019t born yet. But Tony knows the truth. He just doesn\u2019t get one. Isn\u2019t worthy of one. Pepper\u2019s just a fluke, some kind of cosmic karma taunting him about how he shouldn\u2019t have any soul-mates, let alone the most wonderful woman in the world. That it\u2019s all just an accident he doesn\u2019t deserve. </p><p><i>Hey. Stop that Tony. I deserve you and only you. </i></p><p>Tony stares at the words, wishing he could brand them on his skin forever. Usually the thoughts appeared automatically, but over the years, Tony and Pepper had learned that if they concentrated hard enough, they could craft their own messages. Tony doesn\u2019t have to try though, for his most sincere appreciation to shine through. \u00a0</p><p>But he knows the truth. His father stopped talking to him the moment he left home, tired of him and unwilling to put up with him. His old socialite circle was grandiose and bursting at the seams, lies upon lies piling up over gossip and half-meant kisses. Even Obadiah, mentor that he was, was never really there when he needed him. Everyone around Tony either loved him and then left him, or never really loved him at all. </p><hr><p>Tony takes over Stark Industries and out of habit, looked down at his right hand and thought this has to be the day. This has to be. But as usual, his skin remains unchanged and he honestly doesn\u2019t know how he can still feel so disappointed every time. He\u2019s hosting interviews today, for the position of his assistant and he\u2019s already tired and really can\u2019t care less. </p><p>And then Virginia Potts walks into the room. \u00a0</p><p>Tony doesn\u2019t know how he knows. Maybe it\u2019s the white blazer suit, the one she had thought about in a choice between it and the blue one. Maybe it\u2019s the crimson writing on her palm she had told him was his colour. Or maybe it\u2019s the way she looks at him that makes him feel like he\u2019s known her his whole life. </p><p>\u201cYou wanna know something really weird?\u201d he asks, smiling at her taken aback expression.</p><p>\u201cDepends.\u201d she answers slowly.</p><p>\u201cI only have one soul-mate and it\u2019s this girl who has Maroon 5 stuck in her head so much my entire hand is just She Will Be Loved lyrics.\u201d </p><p>She pauses, narrowing her eyes like she almost doesn\u2019t want to believe it. \u201cThat\u2019s weird. My soul-mate always complains about the same thing as though heavy metal is any better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-the peak of music.\u201d they say together, and Tony gapes.</p><p>Pepper smiles. \u201cSo I\u2019ve been told anyway.\u201d </p><p>Pepper lifts her hand, showing Tony his own thoughts. <i>Oh my God it\u2019s her. She\u2019s beautiful.</i></p><p>When he runs to hug her, he tries not to let anything ruin the joy coursing through him, even when he catches a glimpse of bright green hand-writing on Pepper\u2019s other hand <i>YOU FOUND YOUR SOUL-MATE AHHHH!!!</i></p><p>Tony doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever felt happier than kissing Pepper for the first time. And yet he still feels half-way happy. Missing some crucial part of himself that he was robbed of. </p><p>But Tony has Pepper. </p><p>Maybe that could be enough. </p><hr><p>On August 10, everything changes. </p><p>Tony\u2019s forty-one now. He\u2019s married Pepper, a small quiet wedding with just their closest circles. Stark Industries has delved into automated weaponry, and despite everything, Tony\u2019s come to terms now, finally, that he can still be loved even without any writing on his right hand. </p><p>He\u2019s making a sandwich to bring back down to the lab when his right hand burns. Jolting, he drops the knife with a hiss, bringing his hand up to see where he had cut it when he freezes. It\u2019s impossible. It\u2019s utterly impossible but- scratchy blue writing scrawls across his hand, <i>!!!!!</i>. </p><p>Tony\u2019s hand shakes. No. There\u2019s no- there\u2019s no way. Thirty years later, there\u2019s no way- there just- there just isn\u2019t- but the words keep changing, faster and faster. <i>I have a soul-mate. Oh my god! Oh my God! Wow! I have TWO soul-mates! </i></p><p>Tony feels his eyes warm with disbelief, tears pooling at the edge of his lashes. He can\u2019t stop staring at the blue writing curving all around his hand as his soul-mate\u2019s thoughts get more and more out of control. Pepper\u2019s thoughts had always been more constrained, elegant almost, even when they were kids. But whoever\u2019s thoughts are on his hand jumps from one idea to the next, a flurry of energy and vitality that brings up every repressed emotion Tony had hidden deep inside come flooding to the surface.</p><p>He has a soul-mate. He has a soul-mate. They appeared for him. He isn\u2019t unloved. He isn\u2019t a flaw in the universe. He\u2019s- he\u2019s whole. </p><p>The tears wash down his cheeks as Tony closes his eyes, bringing his hands up to his face. His whole life, he had felt like some part of him was missing. That there was something he was supposed to be looking for. And now- </p><p><i>Don\u2019t be sad anymore. Your writing is so sad.</i></p><p>Tony\u2019s mouth trembles. The writing shifting again, <i>How do I cheer them up? A joke? </i></p><p>Two seconds later, <i>I don\u2019t know any jokes though\u2026maybe Ben knows some!</i></p><p>Unprompted, the only thought in Tony\u2019s head is, <i>I don\u2019t even know who this person is, but I love them.</i></p><p><i>I love you too!!</i></p><p>And this time, Tony allows himself to laugh, incredulous and thankful. He\u2019s forty-one when his platonic soul-mate sends their first message. His mother was right, Tony had just needed to wait. The universe had never abandoned it him. It was just waiting to give him the perfect person. But this kid\u2026how can Tony be perfect for him? How can he possibly be deserving of being in a child\u2019s life? A kid so happy it\u2019s almost contagious. </p><p>What is a soul-mate? A person whose atoms are made up from the same star you were born from? A person who has one half of your very own soul? A person you never abandon, no matter what? Maybe the universe gave this kid to Tony to prove he still has love to give in a way he never thought he could have. But maybe one day, this child would need him. Maybe not right now, maybe not that second, but sometime, in the future, they would meet, and Tony knows he\u2019s going to spend every moment trying to make that happen and be there for this kid. </p><p><i>I can\u2019t wait to meet you. </i>He can\u2019t help but think.</p><p><i>Me too! I live at</i></p><p>The text cuts off and Tony smiles in spite of himself. He doesn\u2019t know the tricks of the trade yet and it was somehow more endearing than it should\u2019ve been.</p><p><i>You can\u2019t say anything personal except your name yet kiddo </i></p><p><i>That\u2019s dumb. Rules are dumb. Super duper dumb.</i></p><p>Tony snorts. The kid\u2019ll learn to control his thoughts more one day, but as it is, it\u2019s adorable watching him. Tony takes in a breath, still unable to help his smile. He concentrates his thoughts. </p><p><i>I\u2019m Tony</i>. </p><p><i>My name\u2019s Peter! Do I get to meet you soon?? </i></p><p><i>I want to meet you.</i></p><p><i>Is that weird to say?</i></p><p><i>Oh no, you\u2019re gonna see everything I think. </i></p><p><i>Tony!!</i></p><p>Tony bursts out laughing and he doesn\u2019t know how his entire heart can expand until its swelled with adoration over someone he hasn\u2019t met yet. </p><p><i>!!!</i></p><p><i>That\u2019s so nice</i></p><p><i>Wow</i></p><p>Embarrassed, Tony quickly quiets his mind. No need to traumatize the kid with all his issues and troubles with love. </p><p><i>When you\u2019re older, you\u2019ll get better at only letting certain thoughts appear</i></p><p><i>Wait are you old? My soul-mate\u2019s old??</i></p><p><i>I didn\u2019t know that could happen</i></p><p><i>Hey-</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m old, but not that old </i></p><p>Peter keeps on chattering and Tony counts down the days before the universe brings them together.</p><hr><p>It\u2019s a while later, after Peter\u2019s next birthday- his excitement made Tony smile- when Tony finds out just how deep Obadiah\u2019s betrayal went. He sees the files upon files of under the table deals. Weapons sold to terrorists and warlords and profiteers of senseless violence and death. He traces each deal to an attack that killed more innocents than he could count from all parts of the globe. Stark Industries wasn\u2019t protecting anybody. They were tools of murder. </p><p>Tony can\u2019t move. He\u2019s frozen in his chair. He\u2019s<b> </b>the CEO, he\u2019s the one in charge, he\u2019s the one who had been duped all these years by that lying, two-faced son of a bitch. Shit. He really is the worst. Scum. Garbage. How many people died because of him? How much blood is on his hands? What could he have done better- god it was always about what he could\u2019ve done better. Always playing catch up. </p><p>He thought he was the good guy. Turns out he\u2019d been the villain all along. The universe was wrong. He isn\u2019t worthy of love. He doesn\u2019t deserve it. Smartest man alive. Kid genius. The most brilliant mind of our generation. All that means nothing if he can\u2019t use that so called genius for anything that <b>matters</b>.</p><p>Tony\u2019s head falls into his hands and he shakes. There are no tears. No sobs. He just trembles under the weight of everything he could\u2019ve done differently and wishes he could shake hard enough for everything inside of him to fall right out so his guilt doesn\u2019t consume him whole. He should\u2019ve been better. He should\u2019ve been better. </p><p>His right hand burns. </p><p>It stings with such a fierce intensity that it jerks him out of his self-pity. He stares at the blue writing, usually messily scrawled and quick, now bold and in all capitals, looking crisp and authoritative. </p><p><i>You are not a bad person</i></p><p><i>You are not a bad person</i></p><p><i>You are not a bad person</i></p><p>Every time the thought seems to disappear, the words come back bolder, like Peter\u2019s focusing desperately on keeping that one thought coherent. Demanding Tony to read it. Demanding he accept it. Tony watches as Peter battles with his constant stream of ideas to present just this one and he can imagine a little boy, scrunching his face in concentration, clutching his wrist, working so damn <i>hard</i> so that someone like <i>Tony </i>would hear him. </p><p>The tears finally well up in his eyes and Tony can\u2019t help but feel worse because here he was bringing this little kid down. The kid Tony promised to protect is trying to protect him and he really is the <i>worst</i>. </p><p><i>Not the worst. </i></p><p><i>You\u2019re the best Tony</i></p><p><i>The best the best the best </i></p><p><i>I\u2019m your soul mate so I\u2019ll love you forever even if you don\u2019t love yourself yet</i></p><p><i>May says sometimes that takes a while </i></p><p><i>But I\u2019ll tell you everything I love about you</i></p><p><i>Because you\u2019re good </i></p><p><i>You\u2019re good Tony, you\u2019re good</i></p><p><i>You made good jokes</i></p><p><i>You give me better advice than Ned</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re so smart! Sometimes I see words I don\u2019t even know how to say on my hand and I\u2019m like woahhh!!</i></p><p><i>And you always say nice things to me</i></p><p><i>And you give me funny nicknames</i></p><p><i>No one gives me nicknames so I really like that </i></p><p><i>You\u2019re a good person</i></p><p><i>I know it</i></p><p>Peter\u2019s writing flourishes on his palm almost faster than Tony can read them all and the tears come down harder when Peter doesn\u2019t seem to run out of things to say. He keeps pouring out love and Tony tries desperately to receive it and he thinks maybe he was wrong about what the universe had intended. Maybe he wasn\u2019t meant to save Peter, maybe Peter was meant to save him. Over and over, Peter tells him he can be good. That he <i>is</i> good. And Peter thinks of Tony and thinks about the power of the sun and the wind and the might of the ocean. Tony Stark can do anything and for the first time in his life, Tony believes it. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t feel like a good person. He doesn\u2019t feel anything but guilt and regret. But Peter thinks he\u2019s good. And for Peter, Tony would change the world. </p><p>Tony grits his teeth. Wipes his eyes. Gets up from the floor. He marches down to his lab, ready to unleash hell and turn the entire company around. This isn\u2019t the legacy he\u2019s going to leave behind. He\u2019s done with the world of war and blood. Peter is going to grow up in a world of peace. Tony will make sure of it. </p><p>It\u2019s all over the news the next day. </p><p>STARK INDUSTRIES SHAKEN BY SHOCKING REVELATIONS OF OBADIAH STANE\u2019S DEALS WITH TERRORISTS</p><p>TONY STARK, CEO OF STARK INDUSTRIES, EXPOSES STANE\u2019S WRONGDOING AT BOARD MEMBER\u2019S MEETING </p><p>STARK INDUSTRIES TO SHUT DOWN THE WEAPONS DIVISION EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY </p><p>TONY STARK, CRAZY? OR JUST STUPID? </p><p>CEO TONY STARK TAKES THE MANTLE OF SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE ENTERPRISE TOO SERIOUSLY? </p><p>The media can say whatever they want. They can call him crazy or stupid or the worst thing to happen to business since the housing bubble, but Tony doesn\u2019t care. Peter said he was a good person. And he intended on making sure he was right. </p><hr><p>It\u2019s three years later and Tony\u2019s been delighted with hearing the literal stream of consciousness from Peter over his first crush- a black haired girl named Lindsay,- his adventures in the world of Lego- ridiculous,- and every little dorky thing a nerd kid would get up to in his life. Bored at a meeting or needing a break from the mundane, Tony knows he can just glance at his hand for a good pick me up. </p><p>Peter\u2019s gotten better at controlling his thoughts now. Tony\u2019s hand is no longer an eternally marred canvas, but Peter\u2019s thoughts are still hilariously out of control. Which is why when the blue splatters across his hand Tony almost chuckles before he really reads what\u2019s going on.</p><p><i>No. No nonono no no nono please</i></p><p><i>Please please </i></p><p><i>Ben</i></p><p><i>Ben</i></p><p><i>Oh no </i></p><p><i>Please don\u2019t go please don\u2019t-</i></p><p>Tony\u2019s hand trembles. He clutches it in his left, unable to stop staring at the horror unfolding across his skin. Peter\u2019s in pain. Soul-mates can\u2019t feel each other but Tony can see Peter unraveling anyway. The writing smudges on his palm like Peter\u2019s barely coherent. Tony thinks he can make out the word \u2018no\u2019 and \u2018please\u2019 but mostly it\u2019s Ben\u2019s name, blurred on his hand like he\u2019s seeing through tears. </p><p><i>I need help</i></p><p><i>I need help</i></p><p><i>Someone help me please</i></p><p><i>HELP ME</i></p><p>Tony clenches his jaw, a frustrated growl in the back of his throat. Running, he surges into his lab, throwing himself onto his chair, fingers clattering against the keyboard. \u201cJARVIS call emergency responders tell them-\u201d Tony trails off. </p><p>Tell them what? That there\u2019s a kid somewhere crying about his uncle? Crying over what? What happened? Who else was there? More importantly, <i>where</i> was there. Tony\u2019s heart tremors, he sucks in a breath. He feels like his lungs have shrunk inside him. That the air\u2019s disappeared. His right hand is still on fire, the blue has now consumed his palm, there are barely any distinguishable words from how many of them there are and all Tony can do is press his hand to his lips and rock himself back and forth.</p><p><i>I\u2019m sorry</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m sorry</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m sorry Peter </i></p><p><i>God I\u2019m so sorry</i></p><p>He watches and waits for a hint, a sign, anything to help him know where Peter is and what happened, a hint, a kernel, just the <i>possibility</i> of being to help him. But the day darkens and Tony gets nothing. Not one useful thing. </p><p>Eventually, the blue melts away and it\u2019s replaced by just one sentence that stays even into the night. </p><p><i>Ben\u2019s dead. </i></p><p><i>My fault. </i></p><p>And Tony shakes. </p><hr><p><i>I don\u2019t want to do this</i></p><p><i>I can\u2019t do this</i></p><p><i>Please Tony</i></p><p><i>Please, please please </i></p><p><i>Make it go away </i></p><p><i>Make it stop </i></p><p><i>I can\u2019t do this</i></p><p>Today\u2019s the day of Ben\u2019s funeral and Tony scours the web for any sign of it, but with no last name, Ben dies with thousands of his name. </p><p>Tony focuses everything he has into crafting the perfect message. He wants to be there. Needs to be there. The second Peter\u2019s writing first appeared he had sworn that he would always look out for him, always be there for him, that he would be better than he ever could be because this was the universe giving him a second chance at love. </p><p><i>You can do it Peter</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re strong and you\u2019re kind and you loved your uncle</i></p><p><i>And he would want you there to see him off </i></p><p><i>And be with your aunt</i></p><p>Peter\u2019s reply is immediate. </p><p><i>It should\u2019ve been me</i></p><p>Tony knows he hadn\u2019t meant to let that slip out. He can tell from how it disappears the second it\u2019s written. But it\u2019s too late. The damage is done. </p><p><i>Don\u2019t say that</i></p><p>Tony doesn\u2019t even have to try and focus. He can\u2019t. Even if he wanted to. There\u2019s something fierce inside him. Something deep and primal and unwilling to ever let go. A desperate love he\u2019s never felt before. </p><p><i>Don\u2019t you ever say that</i></p><p>For the first time in a long time, his thoughts become a wave, they douse Peter\u2019s hand and he can\u2019t stop it.</p><p><i>Your life is worth more than you\u2019ll ever possibly know to your uncle</i></p><p><i>He loved you and he wanted you to live</i></p><p><i>Your life meant everything to him</i></p><p><i>I don\u2019t need to have met him to know that</i></p><p><i>And so now</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re going to go to the funeral</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re going to cry and you\u2019re going to mourn and hug your aunt</i></p><p><i>And then you\u2019re going to live</i></p><p><i>Do you hear me Peter?</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re going to LIVE</i></p><p><i>For your uncle</i></p><p><i>For Ben</i></p><p>And Tony\u2019s feelings are like tidal waves, he can\u2019t stop until he knows Peter understands. He\u2019s never even met the kid but he knows just as certainly as he knows anything in this world that if he were Ben, he would\u2019ve done the exact same thing. That loving someone you have to protect is stronger a force than anything on the planet and that Peter will get through this because he\u2019s still surrounded by love and Tony would make sure of it. </p><p>Unbidden, his thoughts come out before can stop them.</p><p><i>I\u2019m here for you. Now, later, forever. </i></p><p><i>I\u2019m going to find you soon </i></p><p><i>I promise </i></p><p><i>I\u2019m going to </i><b><i>find you</i></b></p><hr><p>Except\u2026Tony\u2019s already tried. He\u2019s tried so many times. But every attempt had failed and the failures were piling atop of him. Crushing and mocking. It\u2019s been months since the funeral and he\u2019s at the exact same place now as he was then. Pen twirling in his hand, Tony stops swiveling in his chair when there\u2019s a knock on his office door. </p><p>The sunlight streams through Pepper\u2019s hair like a halo and Tony\u2019s smile comes as naturally as breathing. \u201cHey Pep.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey yourself.\u201d she greets, an amused note in her wry smile, \u201cYou know you have a meeting in twenty minutes right?\u201d</p><p>Tony feigns surprise, \u201cWhat? Do I? Must\u2019ve slipped my mind.\u201d he makes a snide face, \u201cNo wait, I just decided it was boring and thought we could play hookie and go get coffee instead. My treat.\u201d he waggles his brows in that way he knew always made her laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou know that we\u2019re married and have a joint account right?\u201d but she grins anyway. \u201cActually, I need you to sign this.\u201d </p><p>Not even needing to look at it, Tony flips to the back, scrawling his name with a bit of a flourish. \u201cIs it possible this is even more boring than the meeting?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDepends.\u201d she shrugs, coy. </p><p>\u201cO-n?\u201d he says, dragging the word.</p><p>Something sparkles in Pepper\u2019s eyes, \u201cOn whether you think hosting a summer intern would be fun or not.\u201d</p><p>Tony groans, sliding in his seat. \u201cWhen did this happen? Is this because I missed dinner a week ago because I told you that Happy refused to listen when I said to avoid traffic and-\u201d</p><p>Pepper holds up a hand. \u201cNo.\u201d she says slowly, \u201cThis is because we\u2019re trying to encourage young minds remember? You know, this was technically your idea.\u201d </p><p>Tony looks aghast. \u201cHow dare you.\u201d </p><p>Laughing, Pepper sits across from him on his desk. \u201cRemember when you said it might be fun to host a competition for kids at the next Stark Expo? I thought we could host something for all ages, it would be cute right? To see a bunch of eight year olds walk in with volcanoes? And then I thought, what should the prize be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain how an internship is a prize.\u201d Tony says, expression flat.</p><p>\u201cWhat high school kid obsessed with tech <i>wouldn\u2019t </i>want to work with Tony Stark.\u201d</p><p>Tony smirks, lazy and slow. \u201cIs that a little hint of admiration I sense Miss. Potts?\u201d </p><p>Pepper smiles into his kiss. \u201cNot admiration, just shaking my head at all the misguided youth.\u201d </p><p>Quickly, she snatches up the papers from his desk. \u201cAnd you already signed anyway, so!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheater!!\u201d </p><p>\u201cAll\u2019s fair sweetie.\u201d And she flashes him that smug expression over her shoulder that makes him want to simultaneously kiss and her and sulk, \u201cAnd get up. The meeting\u2019s in five minutes!\u201d </p><p>Tony\u2019s hand burns. <i>She sure got the better of you huh?</i></p><p><i>Zip it kid</i></p><p>Tony shakes his head to hide his grin. </p><hr><p>The universe as it happened, brims with people destined to be together, but who only truly belonged together at a certain moment. Sometimes the people you love the fiercest are those who, in a different time, in a different place, in a different state of mind, you might never have come to love at all. And Tony\u2019s always loved Peter. From the second he knew he existed, he loved him. </p><p>But the right time. </p><p>The perfect time.</p><p>A time where Tony wasn\u2019t grieving and drinking and falling into pits of self-destruction and a time where Peter wasn\u2019t imploding on the inside with guilt and loss, a time where both of them could come into each other\u2019s lives at the perfect moment to acknowledge the worst but bring out the best had yet to come. And Tony\u2019s finally entered it. And he has never felt more afraid and yet, a deeper, intense need for anything ever before in his life. </p><p>The competition\u2019s started. There are three separate rooms, three separate groups. He enters the Kid\u2019s Corner, full of elementary school kids racing through the booths admiring projects their own parents helped them make. Tony takes photos and high-fives children and encourages one shy girl to give a presentation that makes him feel oddly misty. The second room has middle schoolers, probably the worst age group Tony can think of. Even Peter had his days when he was thirteen. And Peter was the sweetest thing since the sugarcane. To be honest, he\u2019s so busy navigating the crowds and playing the part that he doesn\u2019t really notice the burning in both his hands until he\u2019s standing outside the high schooler\u2019s room.</p><p>Pepper\u2019s cursive writing appears like art on his palm, she\u2019s running through her checklist, making sure everything\u2019s all set and good to go. It\u2019s such a small, common thing. But Tony can\u2019t help but think <i>I love you</i> anyway. Pepper always takes such good care of him. Sometimes he doesn\u2019t know if he deserves it. But he cherishes it anyway. </p><p>He looks to his right hand and furrows his brows, fond. The kid\u2019s freaking out. Nervous about presenting soon and that the lights are on him and there\u2019s no way he can compete with all these rich kids when he\u2019s a dumpster diver but it would be so cool to win the competition and-</p><p>Tony stops. No way. </p><p>No way.</p><p>It\u2019s- it\u2019s impossible.</p><p>But it isn\u2019t. It isn\u2019t impossible. And Tony bursts through the doors, eyes wide, muscles tight, his mouth is open like he wants to shout when the curtains draw open on the stage and everyone stops to stare and Tony stops with them. </p><p>He can barely breathe. </p><p>\u201cPresenting Peter Parker and his chemical invention.\u201d</p><p>Peter Parker. </p><p>Tony claps his hands to his mouth. Emotions bursting through every part of him. He can\u2019t take his eyes off him. Peter. Peter. It\u2019s Peter. Peter Parker. And he\u2019s wonderful. Boyish brown curls, a shy smile, the gangly teenage body that doesn\u2019t quite know how to hold itself in the world. \u201cHi- hi everyone, I\u2019m Peter Parker.\u201d </p><p>He sounds exactly like Tony\u2019s imagined. Young and polite and sweet. So sweet. He\u2019s perfect. He\u2019s absolutely perfect. And he\u2019s happy. And <i>Tony\u2019s</i> happy. So so so happy that he\u2019s here. And that today\u2019s the day. And that even if he doesn\u2019t get to meet him at least he got to see him and that\u2019s enough for Tony. It\u2019s enough. </p><p>But his thoughts must have been too loud. Too emotional and strung and so uncontainable he could power a thousand earths because Peter glances down at his own hand and his eyes widen. His head jerks up. Something like longing in the curve of his brows. Hope that he barely wants to believe. He scans the crowd. Tony and Peter lock eyes and he can tell the exact second that Peter realizes that Tony Stark is his soul-mate. His lip wobbles and he looks like he wants to jump into the crowd and run but Peter\u2019s a better kid than Tony ever was and he just shakes his head slightly, like he\u2019s laughing to himself, glances at his hand, <i>I\u2019m so proud of you</i>, and pushes through his presentation because he knows it has to be done and that they\u2019ll have time later. </p><p>Peter\u2019s brilliant on stage. More brilliant than Tony ever was and he knows that Peter will be even better with time. Peter finishes his speech with a shy duck of the head and the sweetest half smile that has Tony feeling endeared to him all over again where he\u2019s waiting in the wings. Peter catches his eye, smiling so uncontrollably it makes him beam and when the curtains close he launches in Tony\u2019s direction, throwing his arms around him like they\u2019d done this a million times. </p><p>The first time Tony spoke to Peter, he had cried from gratitude. The first time he got to hold him, his arms wrapped so tightly around him, feeling Peter\u2019s fingers around his shoulder, he buries his face in Peter\u2019s hair and feels that same gratefulness, that same adoration, that same love for the universe that loved him after all and showed him he could find and give love in return. </p><p>Tony and Peter hold each other tightly and on both their hands, <i>I finally found you</i>. </p></p>",

Your platonic soul mate on your right. Your romantic soul mate on your left. But Tony&rsquo;s always known he&rsquo;s impossible to love. He only gets one. Until Peter.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/18842041\" target=\"_blank\">Link on AO3</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_Pac2IO3jaVcq1pmOXvcQg\" target=\"_blank\">@irondadbingo</a></b></p><hr /><p>When Tony was young, he loved to watch the colours dance across his mother&rsquo;s palms. On her right hand, a bright orange that changed almost every moment, quick and fleeting. Sometimes there&rsquo;d be little drawings, detailed pounding hearts or sloppily constructed portraits. While the orange script vanished and reappeared as a constant, Maria&rsquo;s left hand stayed static, the same dark blue writing having never changed in over twelve years. </p><p>Head perched in his mother&rsquo;s lap, Tony played with her hands, marveling quietly at the contrast. &ldquo;Mama, why don&rsquo;t the red thoughts change anymore?&rdquo; </p><p>Maria pulled her hand back, rubbing her palm with her thumb, almost tracing the words. Tony was old enough to read now. He could see the words <i>I wish I could have met you</i> clearly, written almost like it was scribbled in a rush all along her hand. </p><p>Immediately, the orange writing changed: <i>Don&rsquo;t be sad, I hate it when you&rsquo;re sad</i>. Tony pulled away. Had he upset mama? But quickly, Maria rushed to gather him in her arms, holding him tight. &ldquo;Tony, you remember what the writing means right?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony nodded, still trying to figure out whether he had upset his mother or not. &ldquo;The right hand is your soul mate who&rsquo;s your best friend and the left is your soul mate that you marry.&rdquo;</p><p>Maria smiled, pinching his cheek. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. And do you remember why the words always change?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s their most important thought.&rdquo; he answered, proud when his mother nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;But sometimes&hellip;&rdquo; her voice trailed off, locked in a pain Tony didn&rsquo;t yet understand, &ldquo;sometimes the words stay frozen because that&rsquo;s the person&rsquo;s last thought.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How can someone stop thinking?&rdquo; Tony scrunched his nose. </p><p>He knew for sure that could never happen to him. Even when he didn&rsquo;t want them, his thoughts raced faster than even he could keep up with sometimes. Maria looked down at her hand. &ldquo;Sometimes your soul mate dies.&rdquo; she says quietly, &ldquo;And the last thing they ever thought stays on your skin forever.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony frowned. &ldquo;But your soul-mate is supposed to <i>be</i> with you forever.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;At least I had a soul-mate Tony. Some people aren&rsquo;t so lucky.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s frown deepened, a small kernel of anxiety clustering in his stomach, only to grow bigger with time. How could not everyone have a soul mate? That didn&rsquo;t seem fair. Was it because there weren&rsquo;t enough people? Or was it because some people are just impossible to love at all? </p><p>Tony&rsquo;s voice was small, insecure and anxious, &ldquo;Will I get soul-mates?&rdquo;</p><p>Maria gathered him in her arms, pressing kisses into his hair. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask questions like that Tony, soul-mates or not, everyone deserves love.&rdquo; </p><p>He wouldn&rsquo;t notice until much later that she never really answered his question. Maybe she had known, even then, that he would be difficult to love. </p><p>The day Tony turns ten years old is the most exciting day of his life. He falls asleep when he&rsquo;s still nine and knows that at 4:35 a.m, the exact time he was born, the writing will appear on his right hand. Whichever person turns ten first triggers the writing for both pairs. If he&rsquo;s being honest, he&rsquo;s more excited about his platonic soul-mate than the romantic one. Romance was icky and looked like hard work. Who wanted to always buy flowers all the time? </p><p>The clock ticks its way past ten-thirty p.m, a long time after his bed time. Flipping on his stomach, Tony reaches for his alarm clock, turning the dials to set the alarm for exactly 4:35 a.m. Burying himself into his pillows, Tony waits for the earth to turn. He can&rsquo;t wait. He just can&rsquo;t wait. Maybe now he wouldn&rsquo;t be so lonely all the time. Because now he&rsquo;d find a best friend <i>and</i> a wife and isn&rsquo;t that the best combination ever? That&rsquo;s more than Tony ever wanted. </p><p>He was just tired of being lonely. </p><p>Tony drifts off in a hazy dream. He thinks he catches a glimpse of a little girl with strawberry blonde hair. She looks really pretty. He wakes up before his alarm by only a second, a light burning sensation in his left hand tingling. Tony&rsquo;s eyes widen, heart battering in this throat as he throws himself off the bed to turn on the lights, watching as a white script with almost curly lettering traces itself along his palm. </p><p><i>Cotton candy rain</i></p><p>Tony furrows his brows before remembering what time it is. Smiling to himself, he watches in fascination as the scope of his soul-mate&rsquo;s dreams change. So this is the person he would marry? She seems really cute. </p><p>But something bothers him. His right hand isn&rsquo;t tingling. He scrubs at his palm as though that had anything to do with the process at all but it remains just as blank. That kernel of anxiety pounds into something bigger. Something like dread coiling around it. He has one soul-mate, where&rsquo;s the other? Why aren&rsquo;t they connected to him yet? </p><p>Does he just not have one? </p><p>Tony thinks about what will be on his romantic soul-mate&rsquo;s palm. All the scared thoughts rumbling inside his head. The fears. The insecurities. Immediately, he tries to think of better things. What if she wakes up and thinks those bad things are all about her?? She&rsquo;d hate him before he ever gets the chance to meet her. And Tony really wants to meet her. More than he wants anything. </p><p>Maybe his platonic soul-mate just comes later. </p><p>Yeah. Maybe that&rsquo;s it. </p><hr /><p>Tony&rsquo;s platonic soul-mate never comes. </p><p>He&rsquo;s eighteen now and knows two things. One, Pepper- they couldn&rsquo;t share their real names- was his soul-mate and he loves her more than anything even though he hasn&rsquo;t met her yet. Two, he doesn&rsquo;t need a platonic soul mate or anyone else in the world because he has Rhodey and Rhodey is enough for him. </p><p>The white script flows over his hand, <i>Say I&rsquo;m just a girl one more time. </i></p><p>Tony winces. He would <i>not</i> want to be the sorry asshole on the other side of that conversation. Without even meaning to, Tony checks his other hand and even though it hasn&rsquo;t changed in eight years, the blankness still hurts him somewhere farther down than he could hide. His mother tries to tell him that maybe his soul-mate just wasn&rsquo;t born yet. But Tony knows the truth. He just doesn&rsquo;t get one. Isn&rsquo;t worthy of one. Pepper&rsquo;s just a fluke, some kind of cosmic karma taunting him about how he shouldn&rsquo;t have any soul-mates, let alone the most wonderful woman in the world. That it&rsquo;s all just an accident he doesn&rsquo;t deserve. </p><p><i>Hey. Stop that Tony. I deserve you and only you. </i></p><p>Tony stares at the words, wishing he could brand them on his skin forever. Usually the thoughts appeared automatically, but over the years, Tony and Pepper had learned that if they concentrated hard enough, they could craft their own messages. Tony doesn&rsquo;t have to try though, for his most sincere appreciation to shine through. &nbsp;</p><p>But he knows the truth. His father stopped talking to him the moment he left home, tired of him and unwilling to put up with him. His old socialite circle was grandiose and bursting at the seams, lies upon lies piling up over gossip and half-meant kisses. Even Obadiah, mentor that he was, was never really there when he needed him. Everyone around Tony either loved him and then left him, or never really loved him at all. </p><hr /><p>Tony takes over Stark Industries and out of habit, looked down at his right hand and thought this has to be the day. This has to be. But as usual, his skin remains unchanged and he honestly doesn&rsquo;t know how he can still feel so disappointed every time. He&rsquo;s hosting interviews today, for the position of his assistant and he&rsquo;s already tired and really can&rsquo;t care less. </p><p>And then Virginia Potts walks into the room. &nbsp;</p><p>Tony doesn&rsquo;t know how he knows. Maybe it&rsquo;s the white blazer suit, the one she had thought about in a choice between it and the blue one. Maybe it&rsquo;s the crimson writing on her palm she had told him was his colour. Or maybe it&rsquo;s the way she looks at him that makes him feel like he&rsquo;s known her his whole life. </p><p>&ldquo;You wanna know something really weird?&rdquo; he asks, smiling at her taken aback expression.</p><p>&ldquo;Depends.&rdquo; she answers slowly.</p><p>&ldquo;I only have one soul-mate and it&rsquo;s this girl who has Maroon 5 stuck in her head so much my entire hand is just She Will Be Loved lyrics.&rdquo; </p><p>She pauses, narrowing her eyes like she almost doesn&rsquo;t want to believe it. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s weird. My soul-mate always complains about the same thing as though heavy metal is any better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;-the peak of music.&rdquo; they say together, and Tony gapes.</p><p>Pepper smiles. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve been told anyway.&rdquo; </p><p>Pepper lifts her hand, showing Tony his own thoughts. <i>Oh my God it&rsquo;s her. She&rsquo;s beautiful.</i></p><p>When he runs to hug her, he tries not to let anything ruin the joy coursing through him, even when he catches a glimpse of bright green hand-writing on Pepper&rsquo;s other hand <i>YOU FOUND YOUR SOUL-MATE AHHHH!!!</i></p><p>Tony doesn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s ever felt happier than kissing Pepper for the first time. And yet he still feels half-way happy. Missing some crucial part of himself that he was robbed of. </p><p>But Tony has Pepper. </p><p>Maybe that could be enough. </p><hr /><p>On August 10, everything changes. </p><p>Tony&rsquo;s forty-one now. He&rsquo;s married Pepper, a small quiet wedding with just their closest circles. Stark Industries has delved into automated weaponry, and despite everything, Tony&rsquo;s come to terms now, finally, that he can still be loved even without any writing on his right hand. </p><p>He&rsquo;s making a sandwich to bring back down to the lab when his right hand burns. Jolting, he drops the knife with a hiss, bringing his hand up to see where he had cut it when he freezes. It&rsquo;s impossible. It&rsquo;s utterly impossible but- scratchy blue writing scrawls across his hand, <i>!!!!!</i>. </p><p>Tony&rsquo;s hand shakes. No. There&rsquo;s no- there&rsquo;s no way. Thirty years later, there&rsquo;s no way- there just- there just isn&rsquo;t- but the words keep changing, faster and faster. <i>I have a soul-mate. Oh my god! Oh my God! Wow! I have TWO soul-mates! </i></p><p>Tony feels his eyes warm with disbelief, tears pooling at the edge of his lashes. He can&rsquo;t stop staring at the blue writing curving all around his hand as his soul-mate&rsquo;s thoughts get more and more out of control. Pepper&rsquo;s thoughts had always been more constrained, elegant almost, even when they were kids. But whoever&rsquo;s thoughts are on his hand jumps from one idea to the next, a flurry of energy and vitality that brings up every repressed emotion Tony had hidden deep inside come flooding to the surface.</p><p>He has a soul-mate. He has a soul-mate. They appeared for him. He isn&rsquo;t unloved. He isn&rsquo;t a flaw in the universe. He&rsquo;s- he&rsquo;s whole. </p><p>The tears wash down his cheeks as Tony closes his eyes, bringing his hands up to his face. His whole life, he had felt like some part of him was missing. That there was something he was supposed to be looking for. And now- </p><p><i>Don&rsquo;t be sad anymore. Your writing is so sad.</i></p><p>Tony&rsquo;s mouth trembles. The writing shifting again, <i>How do I cheer them up? A joke? </i></p><p>Two seconds later, <i>I don&rsquo;t know any jokes though&hellip;maybe Ben knows some!</i></p><p>Unprompted, the only thought in Tony&rsquo;s head is, <i>I don&rsquo;t even know who this person is, but I love them.</i></p><p><i>I love you too!!</i></p><p>And this time, Tony allows himself to laugh, incredulous and thankful. He&rsquo;s forty-one when his platonic soul-mate sends their first message. His mother was right, Tony had just needed to wait. The universe had never abandoned it him. It was just waiting to give him the perfect person. But this kid&hellip;how can Tony be perfect for him? How can he possibly be deserving of being in a child&rsquo;s life? A kid so happy it&rsquo;s almost contagious. </p><p>What is a soul-mate? A person whose atoms are made up from the same star you were born from? A person who has one half of your very own soul? A person you never abandon, no matter what? Maybe the universe gave this kid to Tony to prove he still has love to give in a way he never thought he could have. But maybe one day, this child would need him. Maybe not right now, maybe not that second, but sometime, in the future, they would meet, and Tony knows he&rsquo;s going to spend every moment trying to make that happen and be there for this kid. </p><p><i>I can&rsquo;t wait to meet you. </i>He can&rsquo;t help but think.</p><p><i>Me too! I live at</i></p><p>The text cuts off and Tony smiles in spite of himself. He doesn&rsquo;t know the tricks of the trade yet and it was somehow more endearing than it should&rsquo;ve been.</p><p><i>You can&rsquo;t say anything personal except your name yet kiddo </i></p><p><i>That&rsquo;s dumb. Rules are dumb. Super duper dumb.</i></p><p>Tony snorts. The kid&rsquo;ll learn to control his thoughts more one day, but as it is, it&rsquo;s adorable watching him. Tony takes in a breath, still unable to help his smile. He concentrates his thoughts. </p><p><i>I&rsquo;m Tony</i>. </p><p><i>My name&rsquo;s Peter! Do I get to meet you soon?? </i></p><p><i>I want to meet you.</i></p><p><i>Is that weird to say?</i></p><p><i>Oh no, you&rsquo;re gonna see everything I think. </i></p><p><i>Tony!!</i></p><p>Tony bursts out laughing and he doesn&rsquo;t know how his entire heart can expand until its swelled with adoration over someone he hasn&rsquo;t met yet. </p><p><i>!!!</i></p><p><i>That&rsquo;s so nice</i></p><p><i>Wow</i></p><p>Embarrassed, Tony quickly quiets his mind. No need to traumatize the kid with all his issues and troubles with love. </p><p><i>When you&rsquo;re older, you&rsquo;ll get better at only letting certain thoughts appear</i></p><p><i>Wait are you old? My soul-mate&rsquo;s old??</i></p><p><i>I didn&rsquo;t know that could happen</i></p><p><i>Hey-</i></p><p><i>I&rsquo;m old, but not that old </i></p><p>Peter keeps on chattering and Tony counts down the days before the universe brings them together.</p><hr /><p>It&rsquo;s a while later, after Peter&rsquo;s next birthday- his excitement made Tony smile- when Tony finds out just how deep Obadiah&rsquo;s betrayal went. He sees the files upon files of under the table deals. Weapons sold to terrorists and warlords and profiteers of senseless violence and death. He traces each deal to an attack that killed more innocents than he could count from all parts of the globe. Stark Industries wasn&rsquo;t protecting anybody. They were tools of murder. </p><p>Tony can&rsquo;t move. He&rsquo;s frozen in his chair. He&rsquo;s<b> </b>the CEO, he&rsquo;s the one in charge, he&rsquo;s the one who had been duped all these years by that lying, two-faced son of a bitch. Shit. He really is the worst. Scum. Garbage. How many people died because of him? How much blood is on his hands? What could he have done better- god it was always about what he could&rsquo;ve done better. Always playing catch up. </p><p>He thought he was the good guy. Turns out he&rsquo;d been the villain all along. The universe was wrong. He isn&rsquo;t worthy of love. He doesn&rsquo;t deserve it. Smartest man alive. Kid genius. The most brilliant mind of our generation. All that means nothing if he can&rsquo;t use that so called genius for anything that <b>matters</b>.</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s head falls into his hands and he shakes. There are no tears. No sobs. He just trembles under the weight of everything he could&rsquo;ve done differently and wishes he could shake hard enough for everything inside of him to fall right out so his guilt doesn&rsquo;t consume him whole. He should&rsquo;ve been better. He should&rsquo;ve been better. </p><p>His right hand burns. </p><p>It stings with such a fierce intensity that it jerks him out of his self-pity. He stares at the blue writing, usually messily scrawled and quick, now bold and in all capitals, looking crisp and authoritative. </p><p><i>You are not a bad person</i></p><p><i>You are not a bad person</i></p><p><i>You are not a bad person</i></p><p>Every time the thought seems to disappear, the words come back bolder, like Peter&rsquo;s focusing desperately on keeping that one thought coherent. Demanding Tony to read it. Demanding he accept it. Tony watches as Peter battles with his constant stream of ideas to present just this one and he can imagine a little boy, scrunching his face in concentration, clutching his wrist, working so damn <i>hard</i> so that someone like <i>Tony </i>would hear him. </p><p>The tears finally well up in his eyes and Tony can&rsquo;t help but feel worse because here he was bringing this little kid down. The kid Tony promised to protect is trying to protect him and he really is the <i>worst</i>. </p><p><i>Not the worst. </i></p><p><i>You&rsquo;re the best Tony</i></p><p><i>The best the best the best </i></p><p><i>I&rsquo;m your soul mate so I&rsquo;ll love you forever even if you don&rsquo;t love yourself yet</i></p><p><i>May says sometimes that takes a while </i></p><p><i>But I&rsquo;ll tell you everything I love about you</i></p><p><i>Because you&rsquo;re good </i></p><p><i>You&rsquo;re good Tony, you&rsquo;re good</i></p><p><i>You made good jokes</i></p><p><i>You give me better advice than Ned</i></p><p><i>You&rsquo;re so smart! Sometimes I see words I don&rsquo;t even know how to say on my hand and I&rsquo;m like woahhh!!</i></p><p><i>And you always say nice things to me</i></p><p><i>And you give me funny nicknames</i></p><p><i>No one gives me nicknames so I really like that </i></p><p><i>You&rsquo;re a good person</i></p><p><i>I know it</i></p><p>Peter&rsquo;s writing flourishes on his palm almost faster than Tony can read them all and the tears come down harder when Peter doesn&rsquo;t seem to run out of things to say. He keeps pouring out love and Tony tries desperately to receive it and he thinks maybe he was wrong about what the universe had intended. Maybe he wasn&rsquo;t meant to save Peter, maybe Peter was meant to save him. Over and over, Peter tells him he can be good. That he <i>is</i> good. And Peter thinks of Tony and thinks about the power of the sun and the wind and the might of the ocean. Tony Stark can do anything and for the first time in his life, Tony believes it. </p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t feel like a good person. He doesn&rsquo;t feel anything but guilt and regret. But Peter thinks he&rsquo;s good. And for Peter, Tony would change the world. </p><p>Tony grits his teeth. Wipes his eyes. Gets up from the floor. He marches down to his lab, ready to unleash hell and turn the entire company around. This isn&rsquo;t the legacy he&rsquo;s going to leave behind. He&rsquo;s done with the world of war and blood. Peter is going to grow up in a world of peace. Tony will make sure of it. </p><p>It&rsquo;s all over the news the next day. </p><p>STARK INDUSTRIES SHAKEN BY SHOCKING REVELATIONS OF OBADIAH STANE&rsquo;S DEALS WITH TERRORISTS</p><p>TONY STARK, CEO OF STARK INDUSTRIES, EXPOSES STANE&rsquo;S WRONGDOING AT BOARD MEMBER&rsquo;S MEETING </p><p>STARK INDUSTRIES TO SHUT DOWN THE WEAPONS DIVISION EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY </p><p>TONY STARK, CRAZY? OR JUST STUPID? </p><p>CEO TONY STARK TAKES THE MANTLE OF SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE ENTERPRISE TOO SERIOUSLY? </p><p>The media can say whatever they want. They can call him crazy or stupid or the worst thing to happen to business since the housing bubble, but Tony doesn&rsquo;t care. Peter said he was a good person. And he intended on making sure he was right. </p><hr /><p>It&rsquo;s three years later and Tony&rsquo;s been delighted with hearing the literal stream of consciousness from Peter over his first crush- a black haired girl named Lindsay,- his adventures in the world of Lego- ridiculous,- and every little dorky thing a nerd kid would get up to in his life. Bored at a meeting or needing a break from the mundane, Tony knows he can just glance at his hand for a good pick me up. </p><p>Peter&rsquo;s gotten better at controlling his thoughts now. Tony&rsquo;s hand is no longer an eternally marred canvas, but Peter&rsquo;s thoughts are still hilariously out of control. Which is why when the blue splatters across his hand Tony almost chuckles before he really reads what&rsquo;s going on.</p><p><i>No. No nonono no no nono please</i></p><p><i>Please please </i></p><p><i>Ben</i></p><p><i>Ben</i></p><p><i>Oh no </i></p><p><i>Please don&rsquo;t go please don&rsquo;t-</i></p><p>Tony&rsquo;s hand trembles. He clutches it in his left, unable to stop staring at the horror unfolding across his skin. Peter&rsquo;s in pain. Soul-mates can&rsquo;t feel each other but Tony can see Peter unraveling anyway. The writing smudges on his palm like Peter&rsquo;s barely coherent. Tony thinks he can make out the word &lsquo;no&rsquo; and &lsquo;please&rsquo; but mostly it&rsquo;s Ben&rsquo;s name, blurred on his hand like he&rsquo;s seeing through tears. </p><p><i>I need help</i></p><p><i>I need help</i></p><p><i>Someone help me please</i></p><p><i>HELP ME</i></p><p>Tony clenches his jaw, a frustrated growl in the back of his throat. Running, he surges into his lab, throwing himself onto his chair, fingers clattering against the keyboard. &ldquo;JARVIS call emergency responders tell them-&rdquo; Tony trails off. </p><p>Tell them what? That there&rsquo;s a kid somewhere crying about his uncle? Crying over what? What happened? Who else was there? More importantly, <i>where</i> was there. Tony&rsquo;s heart tremors, he sucks in a breath. He feels like his lungs have shrunk inside him. That the air&rsquo;s disappeared. His right hand is still on fire, the blue has now consumed his palm, there are barely any distinguishable words from how many of them there are and all Tony can do is press his hand to his lips and rock himself back and forth.</p><p><i>I&rsquo;m sorry</i></p><p><i>I&rsquo;m sorry</i></p><p><i>I&rsquo;m sorry Peter </i></p><p><i>God I&rsquo;m so sorry</i></p><p>He watches and waits for a hint, a sign, anything to help him know where Peter is and what happened, a hint, a kernel, just the <i>possibility</i> of being to help him. But the day darkens and Tony gets nothing. Not one useful thing. </p><p>Eventually, the blue melts away and it&rsquo;s replaced by just one sentence that stays even into the night. </p><p><i>Ben&rsquo;s dead. </i></p><p><i>My fault. </i></p><p>And Tony shakes. </p><hr /><p><i>I don&rsquo;t want to do this</i></p><p><i>I can&rsquo;t do this</i></p><p><i>Please Tony</i></p><p><i>Please, please please </i></p><p><i>Make it go away </i></p><p><i>Make it stop </i></p><p><i>I can&rsquo;t do this</i></p><p>Today&rsquo;s the day of Ben&rsquo;s funeral and Tony scours the web for any sign of it, but with no last name, Ben dies with thousands of his name. </p><p>Tony focuses everything he has into crafting the perfect message. He wants to be there. Needs to be there. The second Peter&rsquo;s writing first appeared he had sworn that he would always look out for him, always be there for him, that he would be better than he ever could be because this was the universe giving him a second chance at love. </p><p><i>You can do it Peter</i></p><p><i>You&rsquo;re strong and you&rsquo;re kind and you loved your uncle</i></p><p><i>And he would want you there to see him off </i></p><p><i>And be with your aunt</i></p><p>Peter&rsquo;s reply is immediate. </p><p><i>It should&rsquo;ve been me</i></p><p>Tony knows he hadn&rsquo;t meant to let that slip out. He can tell from how it disappears the second it&rsquo;s written. But it&rsquo;s too late. The damage is done. </p><p><i>Don&rsquo;t say that</i></p><p>Tony doesn&rsquo;t even have to try and focus. He can&rsquo;t. Even if he wanted to. There&rsquo;s something fierce inside him. Something deep and primal and unwilling to ever let go. A desperate love he&rsquo;s never felt before. </p><p><i>Don&rsquo;t you ever say that</i></p><p>For the first time in a long time, his thoughts become a wave, they douse Peter&rsquo;s hand and he can&rsquo;t stop it.</p><p><i>Your life is worth more than you&rsquo;ll ever possibly know to your uncle</i></p><p><i>He loved you and he wanted you to live</i></p><p><i>Your life meant everything to him</i></p><p><i>I don&rsquo;t need to have met him to know that</i></p><p><i>And so now</i></p><p><i>You&rsquo;re going to go to the funeral</i></p><p><i>You&rsquo;re going to cry and you&rsquo;re going to mourn and hug your aunt</i></p><p><i>And then you&rsquo;re going to live</i></p><p><i>Do you hear me Peter?</i></p><p><i>You&rsquo;re going to LIVE</i></p><p><i>For your uncle</i></p><p><i>For Ben</i></p><p>And Tony&rsquo;s feelings are like tidal waves, he can&rsquo;t stop until he knows Peter understands. He&rsquo;s never even met the kid but he knows just as certainly as he knows anything in this world that if he were Ben, he would&rsquo;ve done the exact same thing. That loving someone you have to protect is stronger a force than anything on the planet and that Peter will get through this because he&rsquo;s still surrounded by love and Tony would make sure of it. </p><p>Unbidden, his thoughts come out before can stop them.</p><p><i>I&rsquo;m here for you. Now, later, forever. </i></p><p><i>I&rsquo;m going to find you soon </i></p><p><i>I promise </i></p><p><i>I&rsquo;m going to </i><b><i>find you</i></b></p><hr /><p>Except&hellip;Tony&rsquo;s already tried. He&rsquo;s tried so many times. But every attempt had failed and the failures were piling atop of him. Crushing and mocking. It&rsquo;s been months since the funeral and he&rsquo;s at the exact same place now as he was then. Pen twirling in his hand, Tony stops swiveling in his chair when there&rsquo;s a knock on his office door. </p><p>The sunlight streams through Pepper&rsquo;s hair like a halo and Tony&rsquo;s smile comes as naturally as breathing. &ldquo;Hey Pep.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hey yourself.&rdquo; she greets, an amused note in her wry smile, &ldquo;You know you have a meeting in twenty minutes right?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony feigns surprise, &ldquo;What? Do I? Must&rsquo;ve slipped my mind.&rdquo; he makes a snide face, &ldquo;No wait, I just decided it was boring and thought we could play hookie and go get coffee instead. My treat.&rdquo; he waggles his brows in that way he knew always made her laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;You know that we&rsquo;re married and have a joint account right?&rdquo; but she grins anyway. &ldquo;Actually, I need you to sign this.&rdquo; </p><p>Not even needing to look at it, Tony flips to the back, scrawling his name with a bit of a flourish. &ldquo;Is it possible this is even more boring than the meeting?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Depends.&rdquo; she shrugs, coy. </p><p>&ldquo;O-n?&rdquo; he says, dragging the word.</p><p>Something sparkles in Pepper&rsquo;s eyes, &ldquo;On whether you think hosting a summer intern would be fun or not.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony groans, sliding in his seat. &ldquo;When did this happen? Is this because I missed dinner a week ago because I told you that Happy refused to listen when I said to avoid traffic and-&rdquo;</p><p>Pepper holds up a hand. &ldquo;No.&rdquo; she says slowly, &ldquo;This is because we&rsquo;re trying to encourage young minds remember? You know, this was technically your idea.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony looks aghast. &ldquo;How dare you.&rdquo; </p><p>Laughing, Pepper sits across from him on his desk. &ldquo;Remember when you said it might be fun to host a competition for kids at the next Stark Expo? I thought we could host something for all ages, it would be cute right? To see a bunch of eight year olds walk in with volcanoes? And then I thought, what should the prize be?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Explain how an internship is a prize.&rdquo; Tony says, expression flat.</p><p>&ldquo;What high school kid obsessed with tech <i>wouldn&rsquo;t </i>want to work with Tony Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony smirks, lazy and slow. &ldquo;Is that a little hint of admiration I sense Miss. Potts?&rdquo; </p><p>Pepper smiles into his kiss. &ldquo;Not admiration, just shaking my head at all the misguided youth.&rdquo; </p><p>Quickly, she snatches up the papers from his desk. &ldquo;And you already signed anyway, so!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cheater!!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;All&rsquo;s fair sweetie.&rdquo; And she flashes him that smug expression over her shoulder that makes him want to simultaneously kiss and her and sulk, &ldquo;And get up. The meeting&rsquo;s in five minutes!&rdquo; </p><p>Tony&rsquo;s hand burns. <i>She sure got the better of you huh?</i></p><p><i>Zip it kid</i></p><p>Tony shakes his head to hide his grin. </p><hr /><p>The universe as it happened, brims with people destined to be together, but who only truly belonged together at a certain moment. Sometimes the people you love the fiercest are those who, in a different time, in a different place, in a different state of mind, you might never have come to love at all. And Tony&rsquo;s always loved Peter. From the second he knew he existed, he loved him. </p><p>But the right time. </p><p>The perfect time.</p><p>A time where Tony wasn&rsquo;t grieving and drinking and falling into pits of self-destruction and a time where Peter wasn&rsquo;t imploding on the inside with guilt and loss, a time where both of them could come into each other&rsquo;s lives at the perfect moment to acknowledge the worst but bring out the best had yet to come. And Tony&rsquo;s finally entered it. And he has never felt more afraid and yet, a deeper, intense need for anything ever before in his life. </p><p>The competition&rsquo;s started. There are three separate rooms, three separate groups. He enters the Kid&rsquo;s Corner, full of elementary school kids racing through the booths admiring projects their own parents helped them make. Tony takes photos and high-fives children and encourages one shy girl to give a presentation that makes him feel oddly misty. The second room has middle schoolers, probably the worst age group Tony can think of. Even Peter had his days when he was thirteen. And Peter was the sweetest thing since the sugarcane. To be honest, he&rsquo;s so busy navigating the crowds and playing the part that he doesn&rsquo;t really notice the burning in both his hands until he&rsquo;s standing outside the high schooler&rsquo;s room.</p><p>Pepper&rsquo;s cursive writing appears like art on his palm, she&rsquo;s running through her checklist, making sure everything&rsquo;s all set and good to go. It&rsquo;s such a small, common thing. But Tony can&rsquo;t help but think <i>I love you</i> anyway. Pepper always takes such good care of him. Sometimes he doesn&rsquo;t know if he deserves it. But he cherishes it anyway. </p><p>He looks to his right hand and furrows his brows, fond. The kid&rsquo;s freaking out. Nervous about presenting soon and that the lights are on him and there&rsquo;s no way he can compete with all these rich kids when he&rsquo;s a dumpster diver but it would be so cool to win the competition and-</p><p>Tony stops. No way. </p><p>No way.</p><p>It&rsquo;s- it&rsquo;s impossible.</p><p>But it isn&rsquo;t. It isn&rsquo;t impossible. And Tony bursts through the doors, eyes wide, muscles tight, his mouth is open like he wants to shout when the curtains draw open on the stage and everyone stops to stare and Tony stops with them. </p><p>He can barely breathe. </p><p>&ldquo;Presenting Peter Parker and his chemical invention.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter Parker. </p><p>Tony claps his hands to his mouth. Emotions bursting through every part of him. He can&rsquo;t take his eyes off him. Peter. Peter. It&rsquo;s Peter. Peter Parker. And he&rsquo;s wonderful. Boyish brown curls, a shy smile, the gangly teenage body that doesn&rsquo;t quite know how to hold itself in the world. &ldquo;Hi- hi everyone, I&rsquo;m Peter Parker.&rdquo; </p><p>He sounds exactly like Tony&rsquo;s imagined. Young and polite and sweet. So sweet. He&rsquo;s perfect. He&rsquo;s absolutely perfect. And he&rsquo;s happy. And <i>Tony&rsquo;s</i> happy. So so so happy that he&rsquo;s here. And that today&rsquo;s the day. And that even if he doesn&rsquo;t get to meet him at least he got to see him and that&rsquo;s enough for Tony. It&rsquo;s enough. </p><p>But his thoughts must have been too loud. Too emotional and strung and so uncontainable he could power a thousand earths because Peter glances down at his own hand and his eyes widen. His head jerks up. Something like longing in the curve of his brows. Hope that he barely wants to believe. He scans the crowd. Tony and Peter lock eyes and he can tell the exact second that Peter realizes that Tony Stark is his soul-mate. His lip wobbles and he looks like he wants to jump into the crowd and run but Peter&rsquo;s a better kid than Tony ever was and he just shakes his head slightly, like he&rsquo;s laughing to himself, glances at his hand, <i>I&rsquo;m so proud of you</i>, and pushes through his presentation because he knows it has to be done and that they&rsquo;ll have time later. </p><p>Peter&rsquo;s brilliant on stage. More brilliant than Tony ever was and he knows that Peter will be even better with time. Peter finishes his speech with a shy duck of the head and the sweetest half smile that has Tony feeling endeared to him all over again where he&rsquo;s waiting in the wings. Peter catches his eye, smiling so uncontrollably it makes him beam and when the curtains close he launches in Tony&rsquo;s direction, throwing his arms around him like they&rsquo;d done this a million times. </p><p>The first time Tony spoke to Peter, he had cried from gratitude. The first time he got to hold him, his arms wrapped so tightly around him, feeling Peter&rsquo;s fingers around his shoulder, he buries his face in Peter&rsquo;s hair and feels that same gratefulness, that same adoration, that same love for the universe that loved him after all and showed him he could find and give love in return. </p><p>Tony and Peter hold each other tightly and on both their hands, <i>I finally found you</i>. </p></p>",

Your platonic soul mate on your right. Your romantic soul mate on your left. But Tony&rsquo;s always known he&rsquo;s impossible to love. He only gets one. Until Peter.</p>\n<p><b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/18842041\" target=\"_blank\">Link on AO3</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_Pac2IO3jaVcq1pmOXvcQg\" target=\"_blank\">@irondadbingo</a></b></p>\n<hr />\n<p>When Tony was young, he loved to watch the colours dance across his mother&rsquo;s palms. On her right hand, a bright orange that changed almost every moment, quick and fleeting. Sometimes there&rsquo;d be little drawings, detailed pounding hearts or sloppily constructed portraits. While the orange script vanished and reappeared as a constant, Maria&rsquo;s left hand stayed static, the same dark blue writing having never changed in over twelve years. </p>\n<p>Head perched in his mother&rsquo;s lap, Tony played with her hands, marveling quietly at the contrast. &ldquo;Mama, why don&rsquo;t the red thoughts change anymore?&rdquo; </p>\n<p>Maria pulled her hand back, rubbing her palm with her thumb, almost tracing the words. Tony was old enough to read now. He could see the words <i>I wish I could have met you</i> clearly, written almost like it was scribbled in a rush all along her hand. </p>\n<p>Immediately, the orange writing changed: <i>Don&rsquo;t be sad, I hate it when you&rsquo;re sad</i>. Tony pulled away. Had he upset mama? But quickly, Maria rushed to gather him in her arms, holding him tight. &ldquo;Tony, you remember what the writing means right?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Tony nodded, still trying to figure out whether he had upset his mother or not. &ldquo;The right hand is your soul mate who&rsquo;s your best friend and the left is your soul mate that you marry.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Maria smiled, pinching his cheek. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. And do you remember why the words always change?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s their most important thought.&rdquo; he answered, proud when his mother nodded.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But sometimes&hellip;&rdquo; her voice trailed off, locked in a pain Tony didn&rsquo;t yet understand, &ldquo;sometimes the words stay frozen because that&rsquo;s the person&rsquo;s last thought.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;How can someone stop thinking?&rdquo; Tony scrunched his nose. </p>\n<p>He knew for sure that could never happen to him. Even when he didn&rsquo;t want them, his thoughts raced faster than even he could keep up with sometimes. Maria looked down at her hand. &ldquo;Sometimes your soul mate dies.&rdquo; she says quietly, &ldquo;And the last thing they ever thought stays on your skin forever.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>Tony frowned. &ldquo;But your soul-mate is supposed to <i>be</i> with you forever.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;At least I had a soul-mate Tony. Some people aren&rsquo;t so lucky.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Tony&rsquo;s frown deepened, a small kernel of anxiety clustering in his stomach, only to grow bigger with time. How could not everyone have a soul mate? That didn&rsquo;t seem fair. Was it because there weren&rsquo;t enough people? Or was it because some people are just impossible to love at all? </p>\n<p>Tony&rsquo;s voice was small, insecure and anxious, &ldquo;Will I get soul-mates?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Maria gathered him in her arms, pressing kisses into his hair. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask questions like that Tony, soul-mates or not, everyone deserves love.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>He wouldn&rsquo;t notice until much later that she never really answered his question. Maybe she had known, even then, that he would be difficult to love. </p>\n</p>",

I\u00a0just-\u00a0I have a hard time.. y'know..-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Orgasming?&rdquo;</p><p>You groaned again. &ldquo;I hate this conversation.&rdquo;</p><p>MJ put her hands up in surrender. &ldquo;Hey, you were the one that wanted to have this sex talk.&rdquo;</p><p>You rolled your eyes. &ldquo;Anyway, I think I&rsquo;m just scared I won&rsquo;t be able to and then\u00a0he&rsquo;ll be all embarrassed and then I&rsquo;ll be embarrassed, so I&hellip; fake it. And it wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time either, I did the same with Ian and Devin.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And Peter has no idea?&rdquo; MJ asked, looking up from her homework.</p><p>&ldquo;Well I hate to brag but by the time I started dating Peter I got very good at faking it.&rdquo; You said pathetically.</p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N) that is the saddest thing I&rsquo;ve ever heard, don&rsquo;t worry you&rsquo;re not bragging.&rdquo; She responded sarcastically.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I know. What do you think I should do? I just feel so guilty.&rdquo;</p><p>MJ shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know man. Just talk to him I guess, how long can you go pretending anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>You shook your head. &ldquo;Yeah&hellip; I&rsquo;m just- I&rsquo;m gonna go to bed now, I&rsquo;ll talk to you tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;See ya.&rdquo; MJ said before ending the call.</p><p>Peter backed away from your window, but lingered on the wall as everything you and MJ said sunk\u00a0in.</p><p>And Peter didn&rsquo;t know how to feel anything other than embarrassed and betrayed.</p><p>You faked it,</p><p>Every. Single. Time.</p><p>And Peter began replaying every time the two of you had sex.</p><p>The first time you two were together, to when you had done it in the janitors closet, to when you told each other that you loved each other, to even just last night.</p><p>How had he never noticed before.</p><p>Peter punched the wall in frustration, before swinging back to his own apartment.</p><p>&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Peter.&rdquo; You greeted your boyfriend the next morning at school, after arriving at his locker.</p><p>Upon hearing and seeing you Peter immediately remembered the anger he felt last night, so with gritted teeth and a clenched jaw responded with a simple, &ldquo;Hey.&rdquo;</p><p>You furrowed your eyebrows at his tone but ignored it anyway. &ldquo;So are we still hanging out later.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; He said without looking at you.</p><p>&ldquo;Oookay?&rdquo; You said confused by\u00a0his attitude. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to you at lunch then.&rdquo; You said, backing away before heading to your own class.</p><p>The rest of the day had gone by in a similar fashion. Peter was very off and you couldn&rsquo;t figure out why, except for that it had to be something with you\u00a0because he was only acting coldly towards you.</p><p>The walk to his place with him after school was quiet and tense, and it was setting you on edge.</p><p>You tried to fill the silence with idle conversation but when his responses came off as less than interested, you finally gave up all together. And even when you reached his apartment, the two of you went straight to the bedroom silently save for the greetings to Aunt May.</p><p>The second Peter stepped into the bedroom he threw his bag down next to his desk and immediately pulled his homework out, and started on it even though it was a Friday, further proving to you that he was ignoring you.</p><p>Meanwhile, you on the other hand, decided to sit on his bed without a word.</p><p>You pulled out your phone and occupied your time with the device.\u00a0</p><p>And that was how the night slowly progressed. You shooting glances at him, while Peter pretended not to notice as he continued his homework.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t until May popped in to tell you two that she was going\u00a0out for a few hours with her friends that you finally said something.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;Peter?&rdquo; You asked quietly, and all you recieved was a hum in response. &ldquo;Are you mad?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter continued writing, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; He said simply but with a bite that told you he was definitely angry.</p><p>&ldquo;Did I do something?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He said again, jaw clenching.</p><p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t tell me, I can&rsquo;t fix it.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter stopped writing and began tapping his pencil against his paper, trying to figure out what to say. &ldquo;&hellip;You&rsquo;ve been faking it.&rdquo; He said as if the words burned his tongue, gaze fixed on the textbook in front of him.</p><p>You sat up on your knees, jaw dropped and eyebrows furrowed. &ldquo;H-how-?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I went to stop by your place last night-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y-you heard.&rdquo; You stuttered out in a small voice, shame seeping into your conscious.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah I heard.&rdquo; He said bitterly. &ldquo;Did you really fake it every time?&rdquo; He finally looked at you.</p><p>You gaped at him, torn between telling the truth and lying but the look he gave you told you it would be wisest to tell the truth. &ldquo;&hellip;I did.&rdquo;</p><p>The pencil in his hand snapped.</p><p>&ldquo;P-Peter I&rsquo;m so sorry, I was just so embarrassed-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh you&rsquo;re embarrassed?&rdquo; He asked sarcastically. &ldquo;Imagine how I feel knowing that everytime I slept with my girlfriend I&rsquo;ve never been able to make her cum.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No! Peter it&rsquo;s really not your fault. The last two guys I dated were never able to make me cum either.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Great, now I&rsquo;m like those two assholes.&rdquo; He muttered, standing up.</p><p>You shot up off the bed, stepping closer to Peter. You placed your hands on his cheeks so he would give you his undivided attention. &ldquo;Listen to me Peter.&rdquo; You said sternly. &ldquo;I love you so much and I am sorry I never told you. You are so amazing in every way and if I&rsquo;m being completely honest&hellip;I&rsquo;ve never been able to make myself cum eith-&rdquo;</p><p>You were roughly cut off by Peter&rsquo;s lips crashing against yours. Your hands fell to his chest, while one of his gripped your jaw firmly and the other tightly held your hip. &ldquo;Stop talking.&rdquo; He muttered, his lips going to your neck.</p><p>&ldquo;W-what?&rdquo; You asked breathlessly.</p><p>&ldquo;I said stop talking.&rdquo; He repeated more firmly this time. He picked you up and tossed you onto the bed, raising a hand to shoot a web at the door to keep it locked in case May came back early.</p><p>Peter moved on top of you now, leaning back. &ldquo;This is how it&rsquo;s gonna go, I&rsquo;m gonna do whatever it takes to make you cu-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But Pete-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m speaking now.&quot;\u00a0</p><p>&quot;S-sorry.&rdquo; You said, biting your lip.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make you cum alright?&rdquo; He said pulling off his sweater, &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re going to\u00a0<i>communicate\u00a0</i>with me this time to make sure- take off your shirt.&rdquo; You did as he said, taking your bra off too. &ldquo;To make sure you do cum, and you&rsquo;re not going to fake it okay?&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded profusely.</p><p>&ldquo;Good.\u00a0<i>Now,\u00a0</i>you can talk.&rdquo; He said as\u00a0his hands began undoing your jeans.</p><p>&ldquo;..What if I can&rsquo;t though.&rdquo; You whimpered.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re going to talk to me, princess.&rdquo; Peter said gently, voice losing its roughness at seeing how worried you were. He pulled your jeans off your legs. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to tell me exactly what you need, and I&rsquo;m going to re-learn everything about your body.&rdquo; Peter pulled off your panties next, leaving you completely naked. &ldquo;&hellip;Grab the headboard for a second.&rdquo; He said, an idea coming to mind.</p><p>You cocked an eyebrow but did as he said anyway and jumped in\u00a0surprise when he webbed your hands together.\u00a0</p><p>You turned your head, looking at your hands, before looking back to Peter with a confused expression.</p><p>&ldquo;I want the only thing you focus on to be on what I&rsquo;m doing.&rdquo; He said, moving down your body so he was situated between your thighs.</p><p>He pulled your legs over his shoulders and you struggled to look down at him because of your bound hands. Without warning Peter flattened his tongue going from the bottom of your slit to the top, making you throw your head back into the pillow with a moan.\u00a0</p><p>He did the same thing again only this time his lips latched onto your clit.</p><p>&ldquo;Ahh~\u00a0<i>fuck.&rdquo;</i> You hissed.</p><p>His mouth worked against you until you were a whimpering mess, your hips beginning to grind against his face desperately, making him bring an arm up to\u00a0pin you\u00a0to the bed.</p><p>He knew you needed more but he wanted to hear it from you first so he\u00a0pulled away and muttered. &ldquo;Start talking princess.&rdquo; Before latching his lips back onto your clit.</p><p>&ldquo;Y-your fingers.&rdquo; You stuttered.\u00a0</p><p>He hummed against you, the vibration sending a wave of pleasure down your spine. Peter brought his free hand to your pussy and slid a finger in easily due to how wet you were.</p><p>His tongue worked your clit as he started thrusting and curling a finger into you.</p><p>And it felt good, it always felt so good. Which was why it was so goddamn frustrating to feel so much pleasure that went no where, built up to nothing.\u00a0</p><p>But tonight you were as determined to cum as Peter was at making you.</p><p>&ldquo;M-more~&rdquo; You gasped out. Peter complied sliding a second finger in, his ministrations speeding up and using more force. &ldquo;<i>Peter~&quot;\u00a0</i>You moaned. &rdquo;<i>Don&rsquo;t stop~ f-fuck.&ldquo;</i></p><p>The two of you sat there for god knows how long and Peter was finally starting to understand why you would fake it.</p><p>He pulled away, fingers still thrusting into you. &quot;C'mon pretty girl, tell me what you need.&rdquo; You just looked so desperate to cum. Mouth gaping open as you whined and begged, your hips trying to move with him if not for the arm pinning you down, and it was driving Peter crazy. He was so hellbent on getting you to cum that he hadn&rsquo;t even registered how painfully hard he was, his own hips beginning to grind into the mattress for a sense of relief.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; The words coming out as a frustrated sob, making Peter&rsquo;s heart clench.</p><p>That was when he got an idea.</p><p>Peter had always been aware of how gentle or rough he was with you, because if he didn&rsquo;t he could seriously hurt you due to his super strength.</p><p>But right now he realized that maybe that was just what you needed.</p><p>So with new intent, Peter slid a third finger in and started thrusting them into you, curling them to hit your g-spot perfectly. Mouth reattaching to your pussy again, he stimulated you with more force and strength behind every movement than he had ever used\u00a0before.</p><p>And your reaction was immediate.</p><p>You practically screamed in pleasure. Body shaking almost violently, as your legs were wrapped tightly behind his back.</p><p>Your mind had gone fuzzy, never having felt this much pleasure before. And it was seriously fucking you up.\u00a0</p><p>An unfamiliar knot started forming making you more and more desperate for Peter. And just as\u00a0you felt you were about to fall over the edge for the first time.</p><p>Peter stopped, removing his fingers and mouth.</p><p>Your eyes shot wide open. &ldquo;<i>P-Peter</i>.&rdquo; You sobbed. &ldquo;Why&rsquo;d you s-stop.&quot;\u00a0</p><p>Peter crawled up your body, thumb wiping away the tears you didn&rsquo;t realize had fallen.\u00a0</p><p>He kissed your lips before saying. &quot;Couple of reasons. First, that&rsquo;s what you get for not telling me about this sooner, and second, I realized that I want to be in you the first time you cum.&quot;\u00a0</p><p>You whimpered as he backed away so he could undo his pants. Your eyes raked up and down his lean muscular body, your fingers starting to itch with wanting to touch him.</p><p>&quot;Can you dissolve the webs?&rdquo; You asked.</p><p>He paused, looking at you for a second. &ldquo;..No.&rdquo;</p><p>Your eyebrows furrowed. &ldquo;B-but Peter-&rdquo; You whined.</p><p>&ldquo;No. I kinda like you like this, and I have a feeling you&rsquo;re going to need to hold onto the headboard because of how hard I&rsquo;m gonna fuck you.&rdquo;</p><p>Your cheeks burned, he was never usually this forward. &ldquo;Peter!&rdquo; You spluttered.</p><p>He ignored you while he finished undressing himself, getting up to grab a condom before easily finding his spot on top of you again once he finished putting it on. He pressed his lips against yours again in an intoxicating kiss, while he gripped his cock to line up with your entrance and slowly pushed in, making the two of you moan into the kiss.</p><p>He pulled back slightly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to go easy on you.&rdquo; He said breathily, lips grazing yours as he spoke. &ldquo;Think you can handle it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mhmm,&rdquo; you hummed.</p><p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; He said, sitting up as a\u00a0hand went to your leg to hike your thigh onto his hip, while his other hand started gripping the top of his headboard.</p><p>He admired the way you looked with your hands bound as you stared up at him wide eyed.\u00a0</p><p>And without any warning he pulled back and snapped his hips roughly into you. You arched your back as a moan passed through your lips.</p><p>Peter kept a fast and rough pace, fucking into you hard. And he had found himself enjoying it much more than he thought he would, not having to hold back and be mindful of his powers.</p><p>You had been clearly enjoying yourself too. Your head tossed back in ecstasy while you moaned and whined incoherently, forgetting how to form words. You couldn&rsquo;t think at all, only being able to feel Peter.</p><p>The relief you felt when that unfamiliar knot started to form, letting you know that Peter may actually get you to cum, was amazing.</p><p>&ldquo;P-Peter I think I&rsquo;m gonna-&rdquo; you cut yourself off with a moan.</p><p>&ldquo;Y-yeah?&rdquo; He grunted out, picking up more speed. &ldquo;Then do it pretty girl. Cum.&rdquo; His hand that was on your thigh trailed down to your clit and he started rubbing it in rough circles.\u00a0</p><p>The extra stimulation was what tipped you over.</p><p>You came with a loud scream of Peter&rsquo;s name on your lips. And you came\u00a0<i>hard.</i> The pleasure feeling so unreal that you couldn&rsquo;t believe you had gone this long without ever experiencing it. Your vision turned almost black, seeing stars.\u00a0</p><p>You had cum so hard you hadn&rsquo;t even realized Peter came too, until after you came down from the high.</p><p>You were panting, absolutely breathless, feeling Peter&rsquo;s weight on you as he was slumped against you now.</p><p>Your body was shaking, and you muttered out. &ldquo;Holy shit.&rdquo;</p><p>You could feel Peter&rsquo;s smile against your shoulder. He pulled out, making you jump at the feeling and he rolled off of you, panting just as hard while the two of you stared at the bottom of the top bunk.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re amazing.&rdquo; You muttered again.</p><p>Peter laughed, grin widening. &ldquo;And to think you could've\u00a0been cumming this whole time if you just told me.&rdquo;</p><p>You rolled your eyes. &ldquo;Yeah I know&hellip; I was just embarrassed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;</p><p>You hummed. &ldquo;Can I stay the rest of the night?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo; &lsquo;course. I prefer you stay anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So.. can you dissolve the webs now?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter turned his head to look at you, making you turn to look at him too. He raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t think we were actually done, did you?&rdquo;</p><p>You looked at him confused, &ldquo;W-what?&rdquo;</p><p>His hand ran down to your pussy again, finding your clit, making you jump. &ldquo;I plan on making up for every time you faked it, by the end of the night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;B-but what about May? She&rsquo;ll be back soon.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter glanced at the time, seeing that it was only 9. &ldquo;Aunt May goes out with her friends once a month and she never has gotten home before 1 or 2 in the morning. We have time.&rdquo;</p><p>You stared at the glint\u00a0in Peter&rsquo;s eyes, and knew you were utterly screwed. &ldquo;<i>Oh\u00a0fuck.&rdquo;</i></p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'><b>Permanent Taglist:</b></p><p>@Spiderdudeparker <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2D2axV2t0dj4pQaFP6uasw\">@peterparkers-waffles</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVuRgRYHxyK3mO6opUA1pPg\">@smexylemony</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfz9T06_ytOeVBydMOig5dQ\">@ultimategalaxyprogram</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUkEFgAFhXeXKJJSUj_9itg\">@xxxxdelenaxxxx</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/maDSWY_t1iWMlPFrSGaDIOw\">@chonisberonica</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJRWIOc3i_MOZ8CO6g40GZQ\">@meaningoflifeisfandoms</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0KLhB__oUn0dbheVg_dI6Q\">@aegis-s-s</a> @Just-random-stuff-18 @etherealhollandd <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA7b7XQDTTjPhV6jTEuU6Jg\">@yourwonderbelle</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m77CgOlHaUiYZDuZhyx4wrQ\">@roi-yang</a> @ironspiderstark @runningoutofwordstosay <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBhoXljjXMAMrHKHfsI9SFg\">@retroparkers</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mi5eOnbwfVzOiE4wbNfzu3Q\">@marvelismylifffe</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOjj2yoa2-FzhoBtop6-67w\">@marvelhoeingismyhobby</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzcs3pumfb3uWsyfPD6ypCQ\">@thebadtruth</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdIscw27VveffP2Si35wSvQ\">@loud-binch</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWCVpslcPdbLtHOutXpLAvQ\">@cosmicparkerr</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkSrzbQ5cou6w6AZNoeBGPA\">@thechickvic</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8-iaiHtEh87yLE_tlsQnKQ\">@magiclolipopqueen</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNp_KZIeYtZ9SLejoLhNMFw\">@httpmcrvel</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLDF7kbUiItX64tYPzS6-rA\">@parkeroffline</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb6034hvVwLMJQD5QdXYxYg\">@yang-seubinnie</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mF09payeSi2vepMZJft5-5Q\">@lou-la-lou</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZOysTyeC-lW1FAeZ5K1_xw\">@all-of-the-fandom-trash</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mj9dCjwmoLXEcCdOgI1lUNw\">@lovesaweed</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2QGTlU6aeO_eWSPGU2hWuw\">@onaaaaaaaaanplum</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcR8Qy5H7_sxinRp4AIausQ\">@lucifersnipnips</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYA7Wi7QpqC50KPfKR4FGgw\">@riverside-fogarty</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNEzLN0xQc2aL5pNbcMrSQg\">@thegirlwiththeimpala</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/memoORjdcQa_CFQHTj_IivQ\">@joyfullyje</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZuDO8QlYWrGBhBSpm-tG0g\">@roonyxx</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKGLqBsfKCm-ZErVo3cbEeA\">@scoobieboobiedoo</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmMxwuz4_3Xt3rDoy_fWk7Q\">@ixchel-9275</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTSampA6vAY_7wUcDfEZCZQ\">@oh-annaa</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBAuthxbXATbkRbCR1v2EOQ\">@sassyactorsandmanyfandoms</a> </p><p>P.P.

I\u00a0just-\u00a0I have a hard time.. y'know..-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOrgasming?\u201d</p><p>You groaned again. \u201cI hate this conversation.\u201d</p><p>MJ put her hands up in surrender. \u201cHey, you were the one that wanted to have this sex talk.\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes. \u201cAnyway, I think I\u2019m just scared I won\u2019t be able to and then\u00a0he\u2019ll be all embarrassed and then I\u2019ll be embarrassed, so I\u2026 fake it. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time either, I did the same with Ian and Devin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Peter has no idea?\u201d MJ asked, looking up from her homework.</p><p>\u201cWell I hate to brag but by the time I started dating Peter I got very good at faking it.\u201d You said pathetically.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N) that is the saddest thing I\u2019ve ever heard, don\u2019t worry you\u2019re not bragging.\u201d She responded sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. What do you think I should do? I just feel so guilty.\u201d</p><p>MJ shrugged her shoulders. \u201cDon\u2019t know man. Just talk to him I guess, how long can you go pretending anyway.\u201d</p><p>You shook your head. \u201cYeah\u2026 I\u2019m just- I\u2019m gonna go to bed now, I\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee ya.\u201d MJ said before ending the call.</p><p>Peter backed away from your window, but lingered on the wall as everything you and MJ said sunk\u00a0in.</p><p>And Peter didn\u2019t know how to feel anything other than embarrassed and betrayed.</p><p>You faked it,</p><p>Every. Single. Time.</p><p>And Peter began replaying every time the two of you had sex.</p><p>The first time you two were together, to when you had done it in the janitors closet, to when you told each other that you loved each other, to even just last night.</p><p>How had he never noticed before.</p><p>Peter punched the wall in frustration, before swinging back to his own apartment.</p><p>\u2014\u2013</p><p>\u201cHey Peter.\u201d You greeted your boyfriend the next morning at school, after arriving at his locker.</p><p>Upon hearing and seeing you Peter immediately remembered the anger he felt last night, so with gritted teeth and a clenched jaw responded with a simple, \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>You furrowed your eyebrows at his tone but ignored it anyway. \u201cSo are we still hanging out later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He said without looking at you.</p><p>\u201cOookay?\u201d You said confused by\u00a0his attitude. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you at lunch then.\u201d You said, backing away before heading to your own class.</p><p>The rest of the day had gone by in a similar fashion. Peter was very off and you couldn\u2019t figure out why, except for that it had to be something with you\u00a0because he was only acting coldly towards you.</p><p>The walk to his place with him after school was quiet and tense, and it was setting you on edge.</p><p>You tried to fill the silence with idle conversation but when his responses came off as less than interested, you finally gave up all together. And even when you reached his apartment, the two of you went straight to the bedroom silently save for the greetings to Aunt May.</p><p>The second Peter stepped into the bedroom he threw his bag down next to his desk and immediately pulled his homework out, and started on it even though it was a Friday, further proving to you that he was ignoring you.</p><p>Meanwhile, you on the other hand, decided to sit on his bed without a word.</p><p>You pulled out your phone and occupied your time with the device.\u00a0</p><p>And that was how the night slowly progressed. You shooting glances at him, while Peter pretended not to notice as he continued his homework.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until May popped in to tell you two that she was going\u00a0out for a few hours with her friends that you finally said something.</p><p>\u201c\u2026Peter?\u201d You asked quietly, and all you recieved was a hum in response. \u201cAre you mad?\u201d</p><p>Peter continued writing, \u201cNo.\u201d He said simply but with a bite that told you he was definitely angry.</p><p>\u201cDid I do something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He said again, jaw clenching.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t tell me, I can\u2019t fix it.\u201d</p><p>Peter stopped writing and began tapping his pencil against his paper, trying to figure out what to say. \u201c\u2026You\u2019ve been faking it.\u201d He said as if the words burned his tongue, gaze fixed on the textbook in front of him.</p><p>You sat up on your knees, jaw dropped and eyebrows furrowed. \u201cH-how-?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to stop by your place last night-\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-you heard.\u201d You stuttered out in a small voice, shame seeping into your conscious.</p><p>\u201cYeah I heard.\u201d He said bitterly. \u201cDid you really fake it every time?\u201d He finally looked at you.</p><p>You gaped at him, torn between telling the truth and lying but the look he gave you told you it would be wisest to tell the truth. \u201c\u2026I did.\u201d</p><p>The pencil in his hand snapped.</p><p>\u201cP-Peter I\u2019m so sorry, I was just so embarrassed-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh you\u2019re embarrassed?\u201d He asked sarcastically. \u201cImagine how I feel knowing that everytime I slept with my girlfriend I\u2019ve never been able to make her cum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Peter it\u2019s really not your fault. The last two guys I dated were never able to make me cum either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, now I\u2019m like those two assholes.\u201d He muttered, standing up.</p><p>You shot up off the bed, stepping closer to Peter. You placed your hands on his cheeks so he would give you his undivided attention. \u201cListen to me Peter.\u201d You said sternly. \u201cI love you so much and I am sorry I never told you. You are so amazing in every way and if I\u2019m being completely honest\u2026I\u2019ve never been able to make myself cum eith-\u201d</p><p>You were roughly cut off by Peter\u2019s lips crashing against yours. Your hands fell to his chest, while one of his gripped your jaw firmly and the other tightly held your hip. \u201cStop talking.\u201d He muttered, his lips going to your neck.</p><p>\u201cW-what?\u201d You asked breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cI said stop talking.\u201d He repeated more firmly this time. He picked you up and tossed you onto the bed, raising a hand to shoot a web at the door to keep it locked in case May came back early.</p><p>Peter moved on top of you now, leaning back. \u201cThis is how it\u2019s gonna go, I\u2019m gonna do whatever it takes to make you cu-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Pete-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m speaking now.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"S-sorry.\u201d You said, biting your lip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make you cum alright?\u201d He said pulling off his sweater, \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to\u00a0<i>communicate\u00a0</i>with me this time to make sure- take off your shirt.\u201d You did as he said, taking your bra off too. \u201cTo make sure you do cum, and you\u2019re not going to fake it okay?\u201d</p><p>You nodded profusely.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u00a0<i>Now,\u00a0</i>you can talk.\u201d He said as\u00a0his hands began undoing your jeans.</p><p>\u201c..What if I can\u2019t though.\u201d You whimpered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re going to talk to me, princess.\u201d Peter said gently, voice losing its roughness at seeing how worried you were. He pulled your jeans off your legs. \u201cYou\u2019re going to tell me exactly what you need, and I\u2019m going to re-learn everything about your body.\u201d Peter pulled off your panties next, leaving you completely naked. \u201c\u2026Grab the headboard for a second.\u201d He said, an idea coming to mind.</p><p>You cocked an eyebrow but did as he said anyway and jumped in\u00a0surprise when he webbed your hands together.\u00a0</p><p>You turned your head, looking at your hands, before looking back to Peter with a confused expression.</p><p>\u201cI want the only thing you focus on to be on what I\u2019m doing.\u201d He said, moving down your body so he was situated between your thighs.</p><p>He pulled your legs over his shoulders and you struggled to look down at him because of your bound hands. Without warning Peter flattened his tongue going from the bottom of your slit to the top, making you throw your head back into the pillow with a moan.\u00a0</p><p>He did the same thing again only this time his lips latched onto your clit.</p><p>\u201cAhh~\u00a0<i>fuck.\u201d</i> You hissed.</p><p>His mouth worked against you until you were a whimpering mess, your hips beginning to grind against his face desperately, making him bring an arm up to\u00a0pin you\u00a0to the bed.</p><p>He knew you needed more but he wanted to hear it from you first so he\u00a0pulled away and muttered. \u201cStart talking princess.\u201d Before latching his lips back onto your clit.</p><p>\u201cY-your fingers.\u201d You stuttered.\u00a0</p><p>He hummed against you, the vibration sending a wave of pleasure down your spine. Peter brought his free hand to your pussy and slid a finger in easily due to how wet you were.</p><p>His tongue worked your clit as he started thrusting and curling a finger into you.</p><p>And it felt good, it always felt so good. Which was why it was so goddamn frustrating to feel so much pleasure that went no where, built up to nothing.\u00a0</p><p>But tonight you were as determined to cum as Peter was at making you.</p><p>\u201cM-more~\u201d You gasped out. Peter complied sliding a second finger in, his ministrations speeding up and using more force. \u201c<i>Peter~\"\u00a0</i>You moaned. \u201d<i>Don\u2019t stop~ f-fuck.\u201c</i></p><p>The two of you sat there for god knows how long and Peter was finally starting to understand why you would fake it.</p><p>He pulled away, fingers still thrusting into you. \"C'mon pretty girl, tell me what you need.\u201d You just looked so desperate to cum. Mouth gaping open as you whined and begged, your hips trying to move with him if not for the arm pinning you down, and it was driving Peter crazy. He was so hellbent on getting you to cum that he hadn\u2019t even registered how painfully hard he was, his own hips beginning to grind into the mattress for a sense of relief.</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know.\u201d The words coming out as a frustrated sob, making Peter\u2019s heart clench.</p><p>That was when he got an idea.</p><p>Peter had always been aware of how gentle or rough he was with you, because if he didn\u2019t he could seriously hurt you due to his super strength.</p><p>But right now he realized that maybe that was just what you needed.</p><p>So with new intent, Peter slid a third finger in and started thrusting them into you, curling them to hit your g-spot perfectly. Mouth reattaching to your pussy again, he stimulated you with more force and strength behind every movement than he had ever used\u00a0before.</p><p>And your reaction was immediate.</p><p>You practically screamed in pleasure. Body shaking almost violently, as your legs were wrapped tightly behind his back.</p><p>Your mind had gone fuzzy, never having felt this much pleasure before. And it was seriously fucking you up.\u00a0</p><p>An unfamiliar knot started forming making you more and more desperate for Peter. And just as\u00a0you felt you were about to fall over the edge for the first time.</p><p>Peter stopped, removing his fingers and mouth.</p><p>Your eyes shot wide open. \u201c<i>P-Peter</i>.\u201d You sobbed. \u201cWhy\u2019d you s-stop.\"\u00a0</p><p>Peter crawled up your body, thumb wiping away the tears you didn\u2019t realize had fallen.\u00a0</p><p>He kissed your lips before saying. \"Couple of reasons. First, that\u2019s what you get for not telling me about this sooner, and second, I realized that I want to be in you the first time you cum.\"\u00a0</p><p>You whimpered as he backed away so he could undo his pants. Your eyes raked up and down his lean muscular body, your fingers starting to itch with wanting to touch him.</p><p>\"Can you dissolve the webs?\u201d You asked.</p><p>He paused, looking at you for a second. \u201c..No.\u201d</p><p>Your eyebrows furrowed. \u201cB-but Peter-\u201d You whined.</p><p>\u201cNo. I kinda like you like this, and I have a feeling you\u2019re going to need to hold onto the headboard because of how hard I\u2019m gonna fuck you.\u201d</p><p>Your cheeks burned, he was never usually this forward. \u201cPeter!\u201d You spluttered.</p><p>He ignored you while he finished undressing himself, getting up to grab a condom before easily finding his spot on top of you again once he finished putting it on. He pressed his lips against yours again in an intoxicating kiss, while he gripped his cock to line up with your entrance and slowly pushed in, making the two of you moan into the kiss.</p><p>He pulled back slightly. \u201cI\u2019m not going to go easy on you.\u201d He said breathily, lips grazing yours as he spoke. \u201cThink you can handle it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhmm,\u201d you hummed.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He said, sitting up as a\u00a0hand went to your leg to hike your thigh onto his hip, while his other hand started gripping the top of his headboard.</p><p>He admired the way you looked with your hands bound as you stared up at him wide eyed.\u00a0</p><p>And without any warning he pulled back and snapped his hips roughly into you. You arched your back as a moan passed through your lips.</p><p>Peter kept a fast and rough pace, fucking into you hard. And he had found himself enjoying it much more than he thought he would, not having to hold back and be mindful of his powers.</p><p>You had been clearly enjoying yourself too. Your head tossed back in ecstasy while you moaned and whined incoherently, forgetting how to form words. You couldn\u2019t think at all, only being able to feel Peter.</p><p>The relief you felt when that unfamiliar knot started to form, letting you know that Peter may actually get you to cum, was amazing.</p><p>\u201cP-Peter I think I\u2019m gonna-\u201d you cut yourself off with a moan.</p><p>\u201cY-yeah?\u201d He grunted out, picking up more speed. \u201cThen do it pretty girl. Cum.\u201d His hand that was on your thigh trailed down to your clit and he started rubbing it in rough circles.\u00a0</p><p>The extra stimulation was what tipped you over.</p><p>You came with a loud scream of Peter\u2019s name on your lips. And you came\u00a0<i>hard.</i> The pleasure feeling so unreal that you couldn\u2019t believe you had gone this long without ever experiencing it. Your vision turned almost black, seeing stars.\u00a0</p><p>You had cum so hard you hadn\u2019t even realized Peter came too, until after you came down from the high.</p><p>You were panting, absolutely breathless, feeling Peter\u2019s weight on you as he was slumped against you now.</p><p>Your body was shaking, and you muttered out. \u201cHoly shit.\u201d</p><p>You could feel Peter\u2019s smile against your shoulder. He pulled out, making you jump at the feeling and he rolled off of you, panting just as hard while the two of you stared at the bottom of the top bunk.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re amazing.\u201d You muttered again.</p><p>Peter laughed, grin widening. \u201cAnd to think you could've\u00a0been cumming this whole time if you just told me.\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes. \u201cYeah I know\u2026 I was just embarrassed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>You hummed. \u201cCan I stay the rest of the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018course. I prefer you stay anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo.. can you dissolve the webs now?\u201d</p><p>Peter turned his head to look at you, making you turn to look at him too. He raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou didn\u2019t think we were actually done, did you?\u201d</p><p>You looked at him confused, \u201cW-what?\u201d</p><p>His hand ran down to your pussy again, finding your clit, making you jump. \u201cI plan on making up for every time you faked it, by the end of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cB-but what about May? She\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d</p><p>Peter glanced at the time, seeing that it was only 9. \u201cAunt May goes out with her friends once a month and she never has gotten home before 1 or 2 in the morning. We have time.\u201d</p><p>You stared at the glint\u00a0in Peter\u2019s eyes, and knew you were utterly screwed. \u201c<i>Oh\u00a0fuck.\u201d</i></p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'><b>Permanent Taglist:</b></p><p>@Spiderdudeparker <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2D2axV2t0dj4pQaFP6uasw\">@peterparkers-waffles</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVuRgRYHxyK3mO6opUA1pPg\">@smexylemony</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfz9T06_ytOeVBydMOig5dQ\">@ultimategalaxyprogram</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUkEFgAFhXeXKJJSUj_9itg\">@xxxxdelenaxxxx</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/maDSWY_t1iWMlPFrSGaDIOw\">@chonisberonica</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJRWIOc3i_MOZ8CO6g40GZQ\">@meaningoflifeisfandoms</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0KLhB__oUn0dbheVg_dI6Q\">@aegis-s-s</a> @Just-random-stuff-18 @etherealhollandd <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA7b7XQDTTjPhV6jTEuU6Jg\">@yourwonderbelle</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m77CgOlHaUiYZDuZhyx4wrQ\">@roi-yang</a> @ironspiderstark @runningoutofwordstosay <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBhoXljjXMAMrHKHfsI9SFg\">@retroparkers</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mi5eOnbwfVzOiE4wbNfzu3Q\">@marvelismylifffe</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOjj2yoa2-FzhoBtop6-67w\">@marvelhoeingismyhobby</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzcs3pumfb3uWsyfPD6ypCQ\">@thebadtruth</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdIscw27VveffP2Si35wSvQ\">@loud-binch</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWCVpslcPdbLtHOutXpLAvQ\">@cosmicparkerr</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkSrzbQ5cou6w6AZNoeBGPA\">@thechickvic</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8-iaiHtEh87yLE_tlsQnKQ\">@magiclolipopqueen</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNp_KZIeYtZ9SLejoLhNMFw\">@httpmcrvel</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLDF7kbUiItX64tYPzS6-rA\">@parkeroffline</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb6034hvVwLMJQD5QdXYxYg\">@yang-seubinnie</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mF09payeSi2vepMZJft5-5Q\">@lou-la-lou</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZOysTyeC-lW1FAeZ5K1_xw\">@all-of-the-fandom-trash</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mj9dCjwmoLXEcCdOgI1lUNw\">@lovesaweed</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2QGTlU6aeO_eWSPGU2hWuw\">@onaaaaaaaaanplum</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcR8Qy5H7_sxinRp4AIausQ\">@lucifersnipnips</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYA7Wi7QpqC50KPfKR4FGgw\">@riverside-fogarty</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNEzLN0xQc2aL5pNbcMrSQg\">@thegirlwiththeimpala</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/memoORjdcQa_CFQHTj_IivQ\">@joyfullyje</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZuDO8QlYWrGBhBSpm-tG0g\">@roonyxx</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKGLqBsfKCm-ZErVo3cbEeA\">@scoobieboobiedoo</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmMxwuz4_3Xt3rDoy_fWk7Q\">@ixchel-9275</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTSampA6vAY_7wUcDfEZCZQ\">@oh-annaa</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBAuthxbXATbkRbCR1v2EOQ\">@sassyactorsandmanyfandoms</a> </p><p>P.P.

I\u00a0just-\u00a0I have a hard time.. y'know..-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOrgasming?\u201d</p><p>You groaned again. \u201cI hate this conversation.\u201d</p><p>MJ put her hands up in surrender. \u201cHey, you were the one that wanted to have this sex talk.\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes. \u201cAnyway, I think I\u2019m just scared I won\u2019t be able to and then\u00a0he\u2019ll be all embarrassed and then I\u2019ll be embarrassed, so I\u2026 fake it. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time either, I did the same with Ian and Devin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Peter has no idea?\u201d MJ asked, looking up from her homework.</p><p>\u201cWell I hate to brag but by the time I started dating Peter I got very good at faking it.\u201d You said pathetically.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N) that is the saddest thing I\u2019ve ever heard, don\u2019t worry you\u2019re not bragging.\u201d She responded sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. What do you think I should do? I just feel so guilty.\u201d</p><p>MJ shrugged her shoulders. \u201cDon\u2019t know man. Just talk to him I guess, how long can you go pretending anyway.\u201d</p><p>You shook your head. \u201cYeah\u2026 I\u2019m just- I\u2019m gonna go to bed now, I\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee ya.\u201d MJ said before ending the call.</p><p>Peter backed away from your window, but lingered on the wall as everything you and MJ said sunk\u00a0in.</p><p>And Peter didn\u2019t know how to feel anything other than embarrassed and betrayed.</p><p>You faked it,</p><p>Every. Single. Time.</p><p>And Peter began replaying every time the two of you had sex.</p><p>The first time you two were together, to when you had done it in the janitors closet, to when you told each other that you loved each other, to even just last night.</p><p>How had he never noticed before.</p><p>Peter punched the wall in frustration, before swinging back to his own apartment.</p><p>\u2014\u2013</p><p>\u201cHey Peter.\u201d You greeted your boyfriend the next morning at school, after arriving at his locker.</p><p>Upon hearing and seeing you Peter immediately remembered the anger he felt last night, so with gritted teeth and a clenched jaw responded with a simple, \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>You furrowed your eyebrows at his tone but ignored it anyway. \u201cSo are we still hanging out later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He said without looking at you.</p><p>\u201cOookay?\u201d You said confused by\u00a0his attitude. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you at lunch then.\u201d You said, backing away before heading to your own class.</p><p>The rest of the day had gone by in a similar fashion. Peter was very off and you couldn\u2019t figure out why, except for that it had to be something with you\u00a0because he was only acting coldly towards you.</p><p>The walk to his place with him after school was quiet and tense, and it was setting you on edge.</p><p>You tried to fill the silence with idle conversation but when his responses came off as less than interested, you finally gave up all together. And even when you reached his apartment, the two of you went straight to the bedroom silently save for the greetings to Aunt May.</p><p>The second Peter stepped into the bedroom he threw his bag down next to his desk and immediately pulled his homework out, and started on it even though it was a Friday, further proving to you that he was ignoring you.</p><p>Meanwhile, you on the other hand, decided to sit on his bed without a word.</p><p>You pulled out your phone and occupied your time with the device.\u00a0</p><p>And that was how the night slowly progressed. You shooting glances at him, while Peter pretended not to notice as he continued his homework.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until May popped in to tell you two that she was going\u00a0out for a few hours with her friends that you finally said something.</p><p>\u201c\u2026Peter?\u201d You asked quietly, and all you recieved was a hum in response. \u201cAre you mad?\u201d</p><p>Peter continued writing, \u201cNo.\u201d He said simply but with a bite that told you he was definitely angry.</p><p>\u201cDid I do something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He said again, jaw clenching.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t tell me, I can\u2019t fix it.\u201d</p><p>Peter stopped writing and began tapping his pencil against his paper, trying to figure out what to say. \u201c\u2026You\u2019ve been faking it.\u201d He said as if the words burned his tongue, gaze fixed on the textbook in front of him.</p><p>You sat up on your knees, jaw dropped and eyebrows furrowed. \u201cH-how-?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to stop by your place last night-\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-you heard.\u201d You stuttered out in a small voice, shame seeping into your conscious.</p><p>\u201cYeah I heard.\u201d He said bitterly. \u201cDid you really fake it every time?\u201d He finally looked at you.</p><p>You gaped at him, torn between telling the truth and lying but the look he gave you told you it would be wisest to tell the truth. \u201c\u2026I did.\u201d</p><p>The pencil in his hand snapped.</p><p>\u201cP-Peter I\u2019m so sorry, I was just so embarrassed-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh you\u2019re embarrassed?\u201d He asked sarcastically. \u201cImagine how I feel knowing that everytime I slept with my girlfriend I\u2019ve never been able to make her cum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Peter it\u2019s really not your fault. The last two guys I dated were never able to make me cum either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, now I\u2019m like those two assholes.\u201d He muttered, standing up.</p><p>You shot up off the bed, stepping closer to Peter. You placed your hands on his cheeks so he would give you his undivided attention. \u201cListen to me Peter.\u201d You said sternly. \u201cI love you so much and I am sorry I never told you. You are so amazing in every way and if I\u2019m being completely honest\u2026I\u2019ve never been able to make myself cum eith-\u201d</p><p>You were roughly cut off by Peter\u2019s lips crashing against yours. Your hands fell to his chest, while one of his gripped your jaw firmly and the other tightly held your hip. \u201cStop talking.\u201d He muttered, his lips going to your neck.</p><p>\u201cW-what?\u201d You asked breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cI said stop talking.\u201d He repeated more firmly this time. He picked you up and tossed you onto the bed, raising a hand to shoot a web at the door to keep it locked in case May came back early.</p><p>Peter moved on top of you now, leaning back. \u201cThis is how it\u2019s gonna go, I\u2019m gonna do whatever it takes to make you cu-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Pete-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m speaking now.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"S-sorry.\u201d You said, biting your lip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make you cum alright?\u201d He said pulling off his sweater, \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to\u00a0<i>communicate\u00a0</i>with me this time to make sure- take off your shirt.\u201d You did as he said, taking your bra off too. \u201cTo make sure you do cum, and you\u2019re not going to fake it okay?\u201d</p><p>You nodded profusely.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u00a0<i>Now,\u00a0</i>you can talk.\u201d He said as\u00a0his hands began undoing your jeans.</p><p>\u201c..What if I can\u2019t though.\u201d You whimpered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re going to talk to me, princess.\u201d Peter said gently, voice losing its roughness at seeing how worried you were. He pulled your jeans off your legs. \u201cYou\u2019re going to tell me exactly what you need, and I\u2019m going to re-learn everything about your body.\u201d Peter pulled off your panties next, leaving you completely naked. \u201c\u2026Grab the headboard for a second.\u201d He said, an idea coming to mind.</p><p>You cocked an eyebrow but did as he said anyway and jumped in\u00a0surprise when he webbed your hands together.\u00a0</p><p>You turned your head, looking at your hands, before looking back to Peter with a confused expression.</p><p>\u201cI want the only thing you focus on to be on what I\u2019m doing.\u201d He said, moving down your body so he was situated between your thighs.</p><p>He pulled your legs over his shoulders and you struggled to look down at him because of your bound hands. Without warning Peter flattened his tongue going from the bottom of your slit to the top, making you throw your head back into the pillow with a moan.\u00a0</p><p>He did the same thing again only this time his lips latched onto your clit.</p><p>\u201cAhh~\u00a0<i>fuck.\u201d</i> You hissed.</p><p>His mouth worked against you until you were a whimpering mess, your hips beginning to grind against his face desperately, making him bring an arm up to\u00a0pin you\u00a0to the bed.</p><p>He knew you needed more but he wanted to hear it from you first so he\u00a0pulled away and muttered. \u201cStart talking princess.\u201d Before latching his lips back onto your clit.</p><p>\u201cY-your fingers.\u201d You stuttered.\u00a0</p><p>He hummed against you, the vibration sending a wave of pleasure down your spine. Peter brought his free hand to your pussy and slid a finger in easily due to how wet you were.</p><p>His tongue worked your clit as he started thrusting and curling a finger into you.</p><p>And it felt good, it always felt so good. Which was why it was so goddamn frustrating to feel so much pleasure that went no where, built up to nothing.\u00a0</p><p>But tonight you were as determined to cum as Peter was at making you.</p><p>\u201cM-more~\u201d You gasped out. Peter complied sliding a second finger in, his ministrations speeding up and using more force. \u201c<i>Peter~\"\u00a0</i>You moaned. \u201d<i>Don\u2019t stop~ f-fuck.\u201c</i></p><p>The two of you sat there for god knows how long and Peter was finally starting to understand why you would fake it.</p><p>He pulled away, fingers still thrusting into you. \"C'mon pretty girl, tell me what you need.\u201d You just looked so desperate to cum. Mouth gaping open as you whined and begged, your hips trying to move with him if not for the arm pinning you down, and it was driving Peter crazy. He was so hellbent on getting you to cum that he hadn\u2019t even registered how painfully hard he was, his own hips beginning to grind into the mattress for a sense of relief.</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know.\u201d The words coming out as a frustrated sob, making Peter\u2019s heart clench.</p><p>That was when he got an idea.</p><p>Peter had always been aware of how gentle or rough he was with you, because if he didn\u2019t he could seriously hurt you due to his super strength.</p><p>But right now he realized that maybe that was just what you needed.</p><p>So with new intent, Peter slid a third finger in and started thrusting them into you, curling them to hit your g-spot perfectly. Mouth reattaching to your pussy again, he stimulated you with more force and strength behind every movement than he had ever used\u00a0before.</p><p>And your reaction was immediate.</p><p>You practically screamed in pleasure. Body shaking almost violently, as your legs were wrapped tightly behind his back.</p><p>Your mind had gone fuzzy, never having felt this much pleasure before. And it was seriously fucking you up.\u00a0</p><p>An unfamiliar knot started forming making you more and more desperate for Peter. And just as\u00a0you felt you were about to fall over the edge for the first time.</p><p>Peter stopped, removing his fingers and mouth.</p><p>Your eyes shot wide open. \u201c<i>P-Peter</i>.\u201d You sobbed. \u201cWhy\u2019d you s-stop.\"\u00a0</p><p>Peter crawled up your body, thumb wiping away the tears you didn\u2019t realize had fallen.\u00a0</p><p>He kissed your lips before saying. \"Couple of reasons. First, that\u2019s what you get for not telling me about this sooner, and second, I realized that I want to be in you the first time you cum.\"\u00a0</p><p>You whimpered as he backed away so he could undo his pants. Your eyes raked up and down his lean muscular body, your fingers starting to itch with wanting to touch him.</p><p>\"Can you dissolve the webs?\u201d You asked.</p><p>He paused, looking at you for a second. \u201c..No.\u201d</p><p>Your eyebrows furrowed. \u201cB-but Peter-\u201d You whined.</p><p>\u201cNo. I kinda like you like this, and I have a feeling you\u2019re going to need to hold onto the headboard because of how hard I\u2019m gonna fuck you.\u201d</p><p>Your cheeks burned, he was never usually this forward. \u201cPeter!\u201d You spluttered.</p><p>He ignored you while he finished undressing himself, getting up to grab a condom before easily finding his spot on top of you again once he finished putting it on. He pressed his lips against yours again in an intoxicating kiss, while he gripped his cock to line up with your entrance and slowly pushed in, making the two of you moan into the kiss.</p><p>He pulled back slightly. \u201cI\u2019m not going to go easy on you.\u201d He said breathily, lips grazing yours as he spoke. \u201cThink you can handle it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhmm,\u201d you hummed.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He said, sitting up as a\u00a0hand went to your leg to hike your thigh onto his hip, while his other hand started gripping the top of his headboard.</p><p>He admired the way you looked with your hands bound as you stared up at him wide eyed.\u00a0</p><p>And without any warning he pulled back and snapped his hips roughly into you. You arched your back as a moan passed through your lips.</p><p>Peter kept a fast and rough pace, fucking into you hard. And he had found himself enjoying it much more than he thought he would, not having to hold back and be mindful of his powers.</p><p>You had been clearly enjoying yourself too. Your head tossed back in ecstasy while you moaned and whined incoherently, forgetting how to form words. You couldn\u2019t think at all, only being able to feel Peter.</p><p>The relief you felt when that unfamiliar knot started to form, letting you know that Peter may actually get you to cum, was amazing.</p><p>\u201cP-Peter I think I\u2019m gonna-\u201d you cut yourself off with a moan.</p><p>\u201cY-yeah?\u201d He grunted out, picking up more speed. \u201cThen do it pretty girl. Cum.\u201d His hand that was on your thigh trailed down to your clit and he started rubbing it in rough circles.\u00a0</p><p>The extra stimulation was what tipped you over.</p><p>You came with a loud scream of Peter\u2019s name on your lips. And you came\u00a0<i>hard.</i> The pleasure feeling so unreal that you couldn\u2019t believe you had gone this long without ever experiencing it. Your vision turned almost black, seeing stars.\u00a0</p><p>You had cum so hard you hadn\u2019t even realized Peter came too, until after you came down from the high.</p><p>You were panting, absolutely breathless, feeling Peter\u2019s weight on you as he was slumped against you now.</p><p>Your body was shaking, and you muttered out. \u201cHoly shit.\u201d</p><p>You could feel Peter\u2019s smile against your shoulder. He pulled out, making you jump at the feeling and he rolled off of you, panting just as hard while the two of you stared at the bottom of the top bunk.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re amazing.\u201d You muttered again.</p><p>Peter laughed, grin widening. \u201cAnd to think you could've\u00a0been cumming this whole time if you just told me.\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes. \u201cYeah I know\u2026 I was just embarrassed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>You hummed. \u201cCan I stay the rest of the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018course. I prefer you stay anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo.. can you dissolve the webs now?\u201d</p><p>Peter turned his head to look at you, making you turn to look at him too. He raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou didn\u2019t think we were actually done, did you?\u201d</p><p>You looked at him confused, \u201cW-what?\u201d</p><p>His hand ran down to your pussy again, finding your clit, making you jump. \u201cI plan on making up for every time you faked it, by the end of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cB-but what about May? She\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d</p><p>Peter glanced at the time, seeing that it was only 9. \u201cAunt May goes out with her friends once a month and she never has gotten home before 1 or 2 in the morning. We have time.\u201d</p><p>You stared at the glint\u00a0in Peter\u2019s eyes, and knew you were utterly screwed. \u201c<i>Oh\u00a0fuck.\u201d</i></p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'><b>Permanent Taglist:</b></p><p>@Spiderdudeparker <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2D2axV2t0dj4pQaFP6uasw\">@peterparkers-waffles</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVuRgRYHxyK3mO6opUA1pPg\">@smexylemony</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfz9T06_ytOeVBydMOig5dQ\">@ultimategalaxyprogram</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUkEFgAFhXeXKJJSUj_9itg\">@xxxxdelenaxxxx</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/maDSWY_t1iWMlPFrSGaDIOw\">@chonisberonica</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJRWIOc3i_MOZ8CO6g40GZQ\">@meaningoflifeisfandoms</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0KLhB__oUn0dbheVg_dI6Q\">@aegis-s-s</a> @Just-random-stuff-18 @etherealhollandd <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA7b7XQDTTjPhV6jTEuU6Jg\">@yourwonderbelle</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m77CgOlHaUiYZDuZhyx4wrQ\">@roi-yang</a> @ironspiderstark @runningoutofwordstosay <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBhoXljjXMAMrHKHfsI9SFg\">@retroparkers</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mi5eOnbwfVzOiE4wbNfzu3Q\">@marvelismylifffe</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOjj2yoa2-FzhoBtop6-67w\">@marvelhoeingismyhobby</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzcs3pumfb3uWsyfPD6ypCQ\">@thebadtruth</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdIscw27VveffP2Si35wSvQ\">@loud-binch</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWCVpslcPdbLtHOutXpLAvQ\">@cosmicparkerr</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkSrzbQ5cou6w6AZNoeBGPA\">@thechickvic</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8-iaiHtEh87yLE_tlsQnKQ\">@magiclolipopqueen</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNp_KZIeYtZ9SLejoLhNMFw\">@httpmcrvel</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLDF7kbUiItX64tYPzS6-rA\">@parkeroffline</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb6034hvVwLMJQD5QdXYxYg\">@yang-seubinnie</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mF09payeSi2vepMZJft5-5Q\">@lou-la-lou</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZOysTyeC-lW1FAeZ5K1_xw\">@all-of-the-fandom-trash</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mj9dCjwmoLXEcCdOgI1lUNw\">@lovesaweed</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2QGTlU6aeO_eWSPGU2hWuw\">@onaaaaaaaaanplum</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcR8Qy5H7_sxinRp4AIausQ\">@lucifersnipnips</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYA7Wi7QpqC50KPfKR4FGgw\">@riverside-fogarty</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNEzLN0xQc2aL5pNbcMrSQg\">@thegirlwiththeimpala</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/memoORjdcQa_CFQHTj_IivQ\">@joyfullyje</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZuDO8QlYWrGBhBSpm-tG0g\">@roonyxx</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKGLqBsfKCm-ZErVo3cbEeA\">@scoobieboobiedoo</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmMxwuz4_3Xt3rDoy_fWk7Q\">@ixchel-9275</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTSampA6vAY_7wUcDfEZCZQ\">@oh-annaa</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBAuthxbXATbkRbCR1v2EOQ\">@sassyactorsandmanyfandoms</a> </p><p>P.P.

I&nbsp;just-&nbsp;I have a hard time.. y'know..-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Orgasming?&rdquo;</p><p>You groaned again. &ldquo;I hate this conversation.&rdquo;</p><p>MJ put her hands up in surrender. &ldquo;Hey, you were the one that wanted to have this sex talk.&rdquo;</p><p>You rolled your eyes. &ldquo;Anyway, I think I&rsquo;m just scared I won&rsquo;t be able to and then&nbsp;he&rsquo;ll be all embarrassed and then I&rsquo;ll be embarrassed, so I&hellip; fake it. And it wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time either, I did the same with Ian and Devin.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And Peter has no idea?&rdquo; MJ asked, looking up from her homework.</p><p>&ldquo;Well I hate to brag but by the time I started dating Peter I got very good at faking it.&rdquo; You said pathetically.</p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N) that is the saddest thing I&rsquo;ve ever heard, don&rsquo;t worry you&rsquo;re not bragging.&rdquo; She responded sarcastically.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I know. What do you think I should do? I just feel so guilty.&rdquo;</p><p>MJ shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know man. Just talk to him I guess, how long can you go pretending anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>You shook your head. &ldquo;Yeah&hellip; I&rsquo;m just- I&rsquo;m gonna go to bed now, I&rsquo;ll talk to you tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;See ya.&rdquo; MJ said before ending the call.</p><p>Peter backed away from your window, but lingered on the wall as everything you and MJ said sunk&nbsp;in.</p><p>And Peter didn&rsquo;t know how to feel anything other than embarrassed and betrayed.</p><p>You faked it,</p><p>Every. Single. Time.</p><p>And Peter began replaying every time the two of you had sex.</p><p>The first time you two were together, to when you had done it in the janitors closet, to when you told each other that you loved each other, to even just last night.</p><p>How had he never noticed before.</p><p>Peter punched the wall in frustration, before swinging back to his own apartment.</p><p>&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Peter.&rdquo; You greeted your boyfriend the next morning at school, after arriving at his locker.</p><p>Upon hearing and seeing you Peter immediately remembered the anger he felt last night, so with gritted teeth and a clenched jaw responded with a simple, &ldquo;Hey.&rdquo;</p><p>You furrowed your eyebrows at his tone but ignored it anyway. &ldquo;So are we still hanging out later.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; He said without looking at you.</p><p>&ldquo;Oookay?&rdquo; You said confused by&nbsp;his attitude. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to you at lunch then.&rdquo; You said, backing away before heading to your own class.</p><p>The rest of the day had gone by in a similar fashion. Peter was very off and you couldn&rsquo;t figure out why, except for that it had to be something with you&nbsp;because he was only acting coldly towards you.</p><p>The walk to his place with him after school was quiet and tense, and it was setting you on edge.</p><p>You tried to fill the silence with idle conversation but when his responses came off as less than interested, you finally gave up all together. And even when you reached his apartment, the two of you went straight to the bedroom silently save for the greetings to Aunt May.</p><p>The second Peter stepped into the bedroom he threw his bag down next to his desk and immediately pulled his homework out, and started on it even though it was a Friday, further proving to you that he was ignoring you.</p><p>Meanwhile, you on the other hand, decided to sit on his bed without a word.</p><p>You pulled out your phone and occupied your time with the device.&nbsp;</p><p>And that was how the night slowly progressed. You shooting glances at him, while Peter pretended not to notice as he continued his homework.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t until May popped in to tell you two that she was going&nbsp;out for a few hours with her friends that you finally said something.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;Peter?&rdquo; You asked quietly, and all you recieved was a hum in response. &ldquo;Are you mad?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter continued writing, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; He said simply but with a bite that told you he was definitely angry.</p><p>&ldquo;Did I do something?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He said again, jaw clenching.</p><p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t tell me, I can&rsquo;t fix it.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter stopped writing and began tapping his pencil against his paper, trying to figure out what to say. &ldquo;&hellip;You&rsquo;ve been faking it.&rdquo; He said as if the words burned his tongue, gaze fixed on the textbook in front of him.</p><p>You sat up on your knees, jaw dropped and eyebrows furrowed. &ldquo;H-how-?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I went to stop by your place last night-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y-you heard.&rdquo; You stuttered out in a small voice, shame seeping into your conscious.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah I heard.&rdquo; He said bitterly. &ldquo;Did you really fake it every time?&rdquo; He finally looked at you.</p><p>You gaped at him, torn between telling the truth and lying but the look he gave you told you it would be wisest to tell the truth. &ldquo;&hellip;I did.&rdquo;</p><p>The pencil in his hand snapped.</p><p>&ldquo;P-Peter I&rsquo;m so sorry, I was just so embarrassed-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh you&rsquo;re embarrassed?&rdquo; He asked sarcastically. &ldquo;Imagine how I feel knowing that everytime I slept with my girlfriend I&rsquo;ve never been able to make her cum.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No! Peter it&rsquo;s really not your fault. The last two guys I dated were never able to make me cum either.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Great, now I&rsquo;m like those two assholes.&rdquo; He muttered, standing up.</p><p>You shot up off the bed, stepping closer to Peter. You placed your hands on his cheeks so he would give you his undivided attention. &ldquo;Listen to me Peter.&rdquo; You said sternly. &ldquo;I love you so much and I am sorry I never told you. You are so amazing in every way and if I&rsquo;m being completely honest&hellip;I&rsquo;ve never been able to make myself cum eith-&rdquo;</p><p>You were roughly cut off by Peter&rsquo;s lips crashing against yours. Your hands fell to his chest, while one of his gripped your jaw firmly and the other tightly held your hip. &ldquo;Stop talking.&rdquo; He muttered, his lips going to your neck.</p><p>&ldquo;W-what?&rdquo; You asked breathlessly.</p><p>&ldquo;I said stop talking.&rdquo; He repeated more firmly this time. He picked you up and tossed you onto the bed, raising a hand to shoot a web at the door to keep it locked in case May came back early.</p><p>Peter moved on top of you now, leaning back. &ldquo;This is how it&rsquo;s gonna go, I&rsquo;m gonna do whatever it takes to make you cu-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But Pete-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m speaking now.\"&nbsp;</p><p>\"S-sorry.&rdquo; You said, biting your lip.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make you cum alright?&rdquo; He said pulling off his sweater, &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re going to&nbsp;<i>communicate&nbsp;</i>with me this time to make sure- take off your shirt.&rdquo; You did as he said, taking your bra off too. &ldquo;To make sure you do cum, and you&rsquo;re not going to fake it okay?&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded profusely.</p><p>&ldquo;Good.&nbsp;<i>Now,&nbsp;</i>you can talk.&rdquo; He said as&nbsp;his hands began undoing your jeans.</p><p>&ldquo;..What if I can&rsquo;t though.&rdquo; You whimpered.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re going to talk to me, princess.&rdquo; Peter said gently, voice losing its roughness at seeing how worried you were. He pulled your jeans off your legs. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to tell me exactly what you need, and I&rsquo;m going to re-learn everything about your body.&rdquo; Peter pulled off your panties next, leaving you completely naked. &ldquo;&hellip;Grab the headboard for a second.&rdquo; He said, an idea coming to mind.</p><p>You cocked an eyebrow but did as he said anyway and jumped in&nbsp;surprise when he webbed your hands together.&nbsp;</p><p>You turned your head, looking at your hands, before looking back to Peter with a confused expression.</p><p>&ldquo;I want the only thing you focus on to be on what I&rsquo;m doing.&rdquo; He said, moving down your body so he was situated between your thighs.</p><p>He pulled your legs over his shoulders and you struggled to look down at him because of your bound hands. Without warning Peter flattened his tongue going from the bottom of your slit to the top, making you throw your head back into the pillow with a moan.&nbsp;</p><p>He did the same thing again only this time his lips latched onto your clit.</p><p>&ldquo;Ahh~&nbsp;<i>fuck.&rdquo;</i> You hissed.</p><p>His mouth worked against you until you were a whimpering mess, your hips beginning to grind against his face desperately, making him bring an arm up to&nbsp;pin you&nbsp;to the bed.</p><p>He knew you needed more but he wanted to hear it from you first so he&nbsp;pulled away and muttered. &ldquo;Start talking princess.&rdquo; Before latching his lips back onto your clit.</p><p>&ldquo;Y-your fingers.&rdquo; You stuttered.&nbsp;</p><p>He hummed against you, the vibration sending a wave of pleasure down your spine. Peter brought his free hand to your pussy and slid a finger in easily due to how wet you were.</p><p>His tongue worked your clit as he started thrusting and curling a finger into you.</p><p>And it felt good, it always felt so good. Which was why it was so goddamn frustrating to feel so much pleasure that went no where, built up to nothing.&nbsp;</p><p>But tonight you were as determined to cum as Peter was at making you.</p><p>&ldquo;M-more~&rdquo; You gasped out. Peter complied sliding a second finger in, his ministrations speeding up and using more force. &ldquo;<i>Peter~\"&nbsp;</i>You moaned. &rdquo;<i>Don&rsquo;t stop~ f-fuck.&ldquo;</i></p><p>The two of you sat there for god knows how long and Peter was finally starting to understand why you would fake it.</p><p>He pulled away, fingers still thrusting into you. \"C'mon pretty girl, tell me what you need.&rdquo; You just looked so desperate to cum. Mouth gaping open as you whined and begged, your hips trying to move with him if not for the arm pinning you down, and it was driving Peter crazy. He was so hellbent on getting you to cum that he hadn&rsquo;t even registered how painfully hard he was, his own hips beginning to grind into the mattress for a sense of relief.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; The words coming out as a frustrated sob, making Peter&rsquo;s heart clench.</p><p>That was when he got an idea.</p><p>Peter had always been aware of how gentle or rough he was with you, because if he didn&rsquo;t he could seriously hurt you due to his super strength.</p><p>But right now he realized that maybe that was just what you needed.</p><p>So with new intent, Peter slid a third finger in and started thrusting them into you, curling them to hit your g-spot perfectly. Mouth reattaching to your pussy again, he stimulated you with more force and strength behind every movement than he had ever used&nbsp;before.</p><p>And your reaction was immediate.</p><p>You practically screamed in pleasure. Body shaking almost violently, as your legs were wrapped tightly behind his back.</p><p>Your mind had gone fuzzy, never having felt this much pleasure before. And it was seriously fucking you up.&nbsp;</p><p>An unfamiliar knot started forming making you more and more desperate for Peter. And just as&nbsp;you felt you were about to fall over the edge for the first time.</p><p>Peter stopped, removing his fingers and mouth.</p><p>Your eyes shot wide open. &ldquo;<i>P-Peter</i>.&rdquo; You sobbed. &ldquo;Why&rsquo;d you s-stop.\"&nbsp;</p><p>Peter crawled up your body, thumb wiping away the tears you didn&rsquo;t realize had fallen.&nbsp;</p><p>He kissed your lips before saying. \"Couple of reasons. First, that&rsquo;s what you get for not telling me about this sooner, and second, I realized that I want to be in you the first time you cum.\"&nbsp;</p><p>You whimpered as he backed away so he could undo his pants. Your eyes raked up and down his lean muscular body, your fingers starting to itch with wanting to touch him.</p><p>\"Can you dissolve the webs?&rdquo; You asked.</p><p>He paused, looking at you for a second. &ldquo;..No.&rdquo;</p><p>Your eyebrows furrowed. &ldquo;B-but Peter-&rdquo; You whined.</p><p>&ldquo;No. I kinda like you like this, and I have a feeling you&rsquo;re going to need to hold onto the headboard because of how hard I&rsquo;m gonna fuck you.&rdquo;</p><p>Your cheeks burned, he was never usually this forward. &ldquo;Peter!&rdquo; You spluttered.</p><p>He ignored you while he finished undressing himself, getting up to grab a condom before easily finding his spot on top of you again once he finished putting it on. He pressed his lips against yours again in an intoxicating kiss, while he gripped his cock to line up with your entrance and slowly pushed in, making the two of you moan into the kiss.</p><p>He pulled back slightly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to go easy on you.&rdquo; He said breathily, lips grazing yours as he spoke. &ldquo;Think you can handle it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mhmm,&rdquo; you hummed.</p><p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; He said, sitting up as a&nbsp;hand went to your leg to hike your thigh onto his hip, while his other hand started gripping the top of his headboard.</p><p>He admired the way you looked with your hands bound as you stared up at him wide eyed.&nbsp;</p><p>And without any warning he pulled back and snapped his hips roughly into you. You arched your back as a moan passed through your lips.</p><p>Peter kept a fast and rough pace, fucking into you hard. And he had found himself enjoying it much more than he thought he would, not having to hold back and be mindful of his powers.</p><p>You had been clearly enjoying yourself too. Your head tossed back in ecstasy while you moaned and whined incoherently, forgetting how to form words. You couldn&rsquo;t think at all, only being able to feel Peter.</p><p>The relief you felt when that unfamiliar knot started to form, letting you know that Peter may actually get you to cum, was amazing.</p><p>&ldquo;P-Peter I think I&rsquo;m gonna-&rdquo; you cut yourself off with a moan.</p><p>&ldquo;Y-yeah?&rdquo; He grunted out, picking up more speed. &ldquo;Then do it pretty girl. Cum.&rdquo; His hand that was on your thigh trailed down to your clit and he started rubbing it in rough circles.&nbsp;</p><p>The extra stimulation was what tipped you over.</p><p>You came with a loud scream of Peter&rsquo;s name on your lips. And you came&nbsp;<i>hard.</i> The pleasure feeling so unreal that you couldn&rsquo;t believe you had gone this long without ever experiencing it. Your vision turned almost black, seeing stars.&nbsp;</p><p>You had cum so hard you hadn&rsquo;t even realized Peter came too, until after you came down from the high.</p><p>You were panting, absolutely breathless, feeling Peter&rsquo;s weight on you as he was slumped against you now.</p><p>Your body was shaking, and you muttered out. &ldquo;Holy shit.&rdquo;</p><p>You could feel Peter&rsquo;s smile against your shoulder. He pulled out, making you jump at the feeling and he rolled off of you, panting just as hard while the two of you stared at the bottom of the top bunk.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re amazing.&rdquo; You muttered again.</p><p>Peter laughed, grin widening. &ldquo;And to think you could've&nbsp;been cumming this whole time if you just told me.&rdquo;</p><p>You rolled your eyes. &ldquo;Yeah I know&hellip; I was just embarrassed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;</p><p>You hummed. &ldquo;Can I stay the rest of the night?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo; &lsquo;course. I prefer you stay anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So.. can you dissolve the webs now?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter turned his head to look at you, making you turn to look at him too. He raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t think we were actually done, did you?&rdquo;</p><p>You looked at him confused, &ldquo;W-what?&rdquo;</p><p>His hand ran down to your pussy again, finding your clit, making you jump. &ldquo;I plan on making up for every time you faked it, by the end of the night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;B-but what about May? She&rsquo;ll be back soon.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter glanced at the time, seeing that it was only 9. &ldquo;Aunt May goes out with her friends once a month and she never has gotten home before 1 or 2 in the morning. We have time.&rdquo;</p><p>You stared at the glint&nbsp;in Peter&rsquo;s eyes, and knew you were utterly screwed. &ldquo;<i>Oh&nbsp;fuck.&rdquo;</i></p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\"><b>Permanent Taglist:</b></p><p>@Spiderdudeparker <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2D2axV2t0dj4pQaFP6uasw\">@peterparkers-waffles</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVuRgRYHxyK3mO6opUA1pPg\">@smexylemony</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfz9T06_ytOeVBydMOig5dQ\">@ultimategalaxyprogram</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUkEFgAFhXeXKJJSUj_9itg\">@xxxxdelenaxxxx</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maDSWY_t1iWMlPFrSGaDIOw\">@chonisberonica</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJRWIOc3i_MOZ8CO6g40GZQ\">@meaningoflifeisfandoms</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0KLhB__oUn0dbheVg_dI6Q\">@aegis-s-s</a> @Just-random-stuff-18 @etherealhollandd <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA7b7XQDTTjPhV6jTEuU6Jg\">@yourwonderbelle</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m77CgOlHaUiYZDuZhyx4wrQ\">@roi-yang</a> @ironspiderstark @runningoutofwordstosay <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBhoXljjXMAMrHKHfsI9SFg\">@retroparkers</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mi5eOnbwfVzOiE4wbNfzu3Q\">@marvelismylifffe</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOjj2yoa2-FzhoBtop6-67w\">@marvelhoeingismyhobby</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzcs3pumfb3uWsyfPD6ypCQ\">@thebadtruth</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdIscw27VveffP2Si35wSvQ\">@loud-binch</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWCVpslcPdbLtHOutXpLAvQ\">@cosmicparkerr</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkSrzbQ5cou6w6AZNoeBGPA\">@thechickvic</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8-iaiHtEh87yLE_tlsQnKQ\">@magiclolipopqueen</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNp_KZIeYtZ9SLejoLhNMFw\">@httpmcrvel</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLDF7kbUiItX64tYPzS6-rA\">@parkeroffline</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb6034hvVwLMJQD5QdXYxYg\">@yang-seubinnie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mF09payeSi2vepMZJft5-5Q\">@lou-la-lou</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZOysTyeC-lW1FAeZ5K1_xw\">@all-of-the-fandom-trash</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mj9dCjwmoLXEcCdOgI1lUNw\">@lovesaweed</a> &nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2QGTlU6aeO_eWSPGU2hWuw\">@onaaaaaaaaanplum</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcR8Qy5H7_sxinRp4AIausQ\">@lucifersnipnips</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYA7Wi7QpqC50KPfKR4FGgw\">@riverside-fogarty</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNEzLN0xQc2aL5pNbcMrSQg\">@thegirlwiththeimpala</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/memoORjdcQa_CFQHTj_IivQ\">@joyfullyje</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZuDO8QlYWrGBhBSpm-tG0g\">@roonyxx</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKGLqBsfKCm-ZErVo3cbEeA\">@scoobieboobiedoo</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmMxwuz4_3Xt3rDoy_fWk7Q\">@ixchel-9275</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTSampA6vAY_7wUcDfEZCZQ\">@oh-annaa</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBAuthxbXATbkRbCR1v2EOQ\">@sassyactorsandmanyfandoms</a> </p><p>P.P.

I hope this is what you wanted, enjoy!</p><p><b>Warnings: </b>Injuries, forced surgery, nudity, angst, fluff, violence, hallucinations. It\u2019s HYDRA, guys. What do you expect?</p><p>* * * *</p><p>Time meant nothing in the small, five foot by five foot cell. The plain metal walls closing in on Y/N as they curled up on the floor, nursing their wounds.</p><p>A small mistake on a mission had snowballed until catastrophe struck. One ambush later Y/N landed in their current predicament, captured by HYDRA agents and brought to&hellip;somewhere. Wherever it was, Y/N wanted out, now.</p><p>Y/N leaned back against the cool metal wall, outstretching their legs as much as the room allowed them to. They winced slightly as the bruise on their hip brushed uncomfortably against the ground, sending ripples of pain throughout their battered body. They turned their attention to their stomach, pulling up their shirt to reveal the long gash that was beginning to knit back together.</p><p>They grimaced at the sight of the wound, tugging their shirt back down to cover it. The rough fabric of the new uniform only irritated it more.</p><p>They closed their eyes and focused, channeling the regenerative energy from\u00a0 within them and bringing it to the surface, directing the flow to the cut. They sighed in relief as the wound began to close, their powers healing it almost instantly.</p><p>Exhaustion gripped Y/N immediately after the brief euphoria of their abilities faded, leaving them completely drained.</p><p>They collapsed back against the wall, they needed to save their energy for later.</p><p>It was only going to get worse from there.</p><!-- more --><p>* * * *</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea where they are?\u201d Peter asked Tony desperately, watching as his mentor poured over his monitors.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to triangulate the last message transmitted by them, but obviously it\u2019s not that easy,\u201d Tony explained, staring into the bright, flashing screens.\u00a0\u201cThe triangulation apparatus is being blocked by some signal reflection, most likely intentionally set up in order to prevent us from locating them.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be able to find them, right?\u201d Peter swallowed nervously, looking over Tony\u2019s shoulder at the complicated algorithms displayed on the computers.<br/></p><p>\u201cAs soon as we\u2019re able to bypass the precautionary measures, yes,\u201d Tony confirmed, eliciting a less than subtle sigh of relief from Peter,\u00a0\u201cbut who knows how long it will take.\u201d<br/></p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widened from the new information, fear churning in his gut as he imagined what horrors Y/N must\u2019ve been experiencing,\u00a0\u201ch-how long?\u201d he squeaked.</p><p>Tony looked up at Peter with tired eyes,\u00a0\u201canything from five hours to a year, depending on the complexity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA year?\u201d Peter rasped, his legs growing unbelievably weak as the full weight of Y/N\u2019s capture crashed down on him.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou alright, kid?\u201d Tony asked, rushing over as he watched Peter almost fall to the ground.<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. I\u2019m fine. I just-I just need to sit down,\u201d he reassured shakily as he stumbled to the nearest chair, letting himself crumple onto the seat.<br/></p><p>\u201cListen, look at me,\u201d Tony knelt down to look Peter in the eye,\u00a0\u201cwe won\u2019t stop until we get Y/N back.\u201d<br/></p><p>Peter nodded unsteadily, resting his head in his hands as sobs shook his body. Tears pooled in his palms and spilled onto his lap as loud cries escaped from his lips.</p><p>If only he had been faster.</p><p>If only he hadn\u2019t made that mistake.</p><p>If only he could hold Y/N in his arms and know they were safe. If only he could bury his face into their neck and breathe them in, feel their warmth in his grasp.</p><p>If only.</p><p>* * * *</p><p>The first few days were by far the worst.</p><p>Hours of isolation that were only interrupted by the occasional physical exam, in which Y/N was poked, cut, and injected with God knows what. Then they\u2019d be once again exiled to their cell, left to brood in silence.</p><p>They lost track of time when they first slept. Their body\u2019s internal clock was completely off, leaving them disoriented and confused. Eventually, days were counted by how many times they were cut open. Each time they were wheeled into another painful surgery, they recorded another day.</p><p>One.</p><p>Two.</p><p>Three.</p><p>Four.</p><p>Five.</p><p>Six.</p><p>Seven.</p><p>This became unreliable after they began spending countless hours under the knife. Sometimes even waking up in the middle of surgery, screaming behind a gag as they watched masked doctors poke and prod at their insides.</p><p>The forced solitude slowly began to take a toll on them. It began small, a whisper of their name, flashes in their periphery vision. They even sought comfort in the sound of another\u2019s voice, even if the source didn\u2019t exist.</p><p>It eventually evolved into full force hallucinations. Things appearing and disappearing with no rhyme or reason. It was almost funny, all the strange things they witnessed. They had almost burst out laughing when they hallucinated a tall pile of apples with googly eyes and stick figure limbs that waved around helplessly.</p><p>It stopped being funny when they hallucinated Peter.</p><p>Y/N had woken up in their cot, blinking from a combination of the endlessly shining light and disbelief. Peter was sitting at the edge of the bed, trying to shake them awake. They sat up, tears welling up in their eyes as they believed their ordeal was over. They pulled him in for a tight embrace, crashing their lips against his in celebration. They could feel his breath against their cheek, taste the soft tang of his lips, it was all so&hellip;<i>real</i>.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until he had faded away, dissolving in the light, that the last bit of their hope had evaporated. Disappearing along with the comforting hallucination.</p><p>Nothing was real after that. They withdrew into themselves and gave up, resigning to their fate.</p><p>Waiting patiently for it to end.</p><p>* * * *</p><p>The two months that Y/N was captured were one of the most nerve-wracking of Peter\u2019s life.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t bring himself to do anything. Spending endless hours just laying in bed, staring blankly up at the ceiling.</p><p>Everything he saw reminded him of them. When he first got the news of their capture, he had overturned nearly everything in his room. Much to the dismay of those living below. He had managed to dig up one of Y/N\u2019s sweaters, and would carry it around with him like a security blanket. He even refused to wash it, not wanting their smell to be washed away.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want the small bit of them he had left to disappear.</p><p>He was laying in bed, clutching Y/N\u2019s dirty sweater to his chest, when he got the call.</p><p>He was tempted to ignore the ringing, preferring to just lay there in silence. That was until he saw the caller ID.</p><p>He grabbed his phone and immediately accepted the call. Putting it to his ear he sputtered,\u00a0\u201cTony, what&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe found Y/N. Get to the compound,\u201d Tony interrupted, hanging up before Peter could say anything else.<br/></p><p>Peter stared at his phone, mind running and heart pounding at the possibility of Y/N\u2019s rescue. He had already begun to forget the small things about them, the shape of their hands, the bend of their spine, the smell of their skin and the feeling of their hair between his fingers.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t wait to remember.</p><p>* * * *</p><p>Y/N knew that something was wrong the moment they woke up on the operating table, again. But this time was different.</p><p>There were no doctors leaning over them. No one shouting in another language before a suffocating face mask was placed onto them, sending them back into unconsciousness. Nobody.</p><p>They tugged against their metal restraints, unable to even lift their head an inch off the table. They let themselves go limp, waiting for the anesthesia to wear off and expose them to the pain of whatever the sadistic doctors had done to them.</p><p>The endless screeching of alarms bore into their head, the flashing lights bathing their bare body in red light. They could hear gunshots echoing in the distance, screams of terror and commands being shouted as <i>something</i> came closer and closer.</p><p>Y/N grit their teeth, considering the consequences of their actions before they opened their aching jaw and screamed, or tried to. Their voice was rusty from lack of use, their cries for help merely amounting to a feeble whimper.</p><p>They coughed loudly, trying to clear their throat.\u00a0\u201cHelp!\u201d they shouted once more, slightly louder. They grimaced as stabbing pains emanated from their chest. Cool air brushed against the exposed skin, causing the wound to sting slightly.</p><p>\u201cHelp!\u201d They yelled, voice rising in volume. They panted, panic coursing through their veins as they remained undiscovered.<br/></p><p>Suddenly, the anesthesia wore off. Y/N\u2019s eyes rolled back as constant waves of pain radiated from their chest. Instinct kicked in and they screamed, a raw screech that would send shivers down the spine of any sane individual.</p><p>Their vision clouded as pain took over, pushing them to the edge of oblivion. They squeezed their eyes shut, trying to breathe past the agony through tightly clenched lips.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d a voice whispered. Their eyes flew open, searching the room.<br/></p><p><i>Stupid, </i>they reprimanded themselves, <i>it\u2019s not real.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cY/N, oh god, Y/N,\u201d the voice sounded panicked, and Y/N could hear the soft sound of someone approaching. Something fumbled with the restraints, managing to unlock the tight metal cuffs.</p><p>Y/N rotated their wrists, enjoying the newfound movement. They looked up at their savior and the blood drained from their face.</p><p>It was Peter, wearing his Spider-Man getup. He ripped off his mask as he stood above them. Y/N allowed themselves to drink in his features. He looked as handsome as ever. His soft curls silhouetted his angled face, his thin lips were tightly pursed in concern. But something was different. His eyes were sunken in, darkened from nights of little sleep. His skin was ghostly pale, and the flashing red lights certainly didn\u2019t help.

They swung their legs out from the bed, and were about to run before they were pulled into a tight embrace.</p><p>\u201cShush, it\u2019s me,\u201d Peter said softly, running his hand through their hair.<br/></p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t-no-stop,\u201d they rasped, flashing back to every time they were forced into surgery.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe, I\u2019m here,\u201d he whispered, rocking Y/N slightly as they sobbed into his shoulder.<br/></p><p>\u201cIt hurts,\u201d they mumbled, calming down in Peter\u2019s arms.<br/></p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d Peter said soothingly.<br/></p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d they begged,\u00a0\u201cstay.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d he reassured them, kissing their forehead gently.

I\u2019m fine. I just-I just need to sit down,\u201d he reassured shakily as he stumbled to the nearest chair, letting himself crumple onto the seat.<br></p><p>\u201cListen, look at me,\u201d Tony knelt down to look Peter in the eye,\u00a0\u201cwe won\u2019t stop until we get Y/N back.\u201d<br></p><p>Peter nodded unsteadily, resting his head in his hands as sobs shook his body. Tears pooled in his palms and spilled onto his lap as loud cries escaped from his lips.</p><p>If only he had been faster.</p><p>If only he hadn\u2019t made that mistake.</p><p>If only he could hold Y/N in his arms and know they were safe. If only he could bury his face into their neck and breathe them in, feel their warmth in his grasp.</p><p>If only.</p><p>* * * *</p><p>The first few days were by far the worst.</p><p>Hours of isolation that were only interrupted by the occasional physical exam, in which Y/N was poked, cut, and injected with God knows what. Then they\u2019d be once again exiled to their cell, left to brood in silence.</p><p>They lost track of time when they first slept. Their body\u2019s internal clock was completely off, leaving them disoriented and confused. Eventually, days were counted by how many times they were cut open. Each time they were wheeled into another painful surgery, they recorded another day.</p><p>One.</p><p>Two.</p><p>Three.</p><p>Four.</p><p>Five.</p><p>Six.</p><p>Seven.</p><p>This became unreliable after they began spending countless hours under the knife. Sometimes even waking up in the middle of surgery, screaming behind a gag as they watched masked doctors poke and prod at their insides.</p><p>The forced solitude slowly began to take a toll on them. It began small, a whisper of their name, flashes in their periphery vision. They even sought comfort in the sound of another\u2019s voice, even if the source didn\u2019t exist.</p><p>It eventually evolved into full force hallucinations. Things appearing and disappearing with no rhyme or reason. It was almost funny, all the strange things they witnessed. They had almost burst out laughing when they hallucinated a tall pile of apples with googly eyes and stick figure limbs that waved around helplessly.</p><p>It stopped being funny when they hallucinated Peter.</p><p>Y/N had woken up in their cot, blinking from a combination of the endlessly shining light and disbelief. Peter was sitting at the edge of the bed, trying to shake them awake. They sat up, tears welling up in their eyes as they believed their ordeal was over. They pulled him in for a tight embrace, crashing their lips against his in celebration. They could feel his breath against their cheek, taste the soft tang of his lips, it was all so\u2026<i>real</i>.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until he had faded away, dissolving in the light, that the last bit of their hope had evaporated. Disappearing along with the comforting hallucination.</p><p>Nothing was real after that. They withdrew into themselves and gave up, resigning to their fate.</p><p>Waiting patiently for it to end.</p><p>* * * *</p><p>The two months that Y/N was captured were one of the most nerve-wracking of Peter\u2019s life.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t bring himself to do anything. Spending endless hours just laying in bed, staring blankly up at the ceiling.</p><p>Everything he saw reminded him of them. When he first got the news of their capture, he had overturned nearly everything in his room. Much to the dismay of those living below. He had managed to dig up one of Y/N\u2019s sweaters, and would carry it around with him like a security blanket. He even refused to wash it, not wanting their smell to be washed away.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want the small bit of them he had left to disappear.</p><p>He was laying in bed, clutching Y/N\u2019s dirty sweater to his chest, when he got the call.</p><p>He was tempted to ignore the ringing, preferring to just lay there in silence. That was until he saw the caller ID.</p><p>He grabbed his phone and immediately accepted the call. Putting it to his ear he sputtered,\u00a0\u201cTony, what\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe found Y/N. Get to the compound,\u201d Tony interrupted, hanging up before Peter could say anything else.<br></p><p>Peter stared at his phone, mind running and heart pounding at the possibility of Y/N\u2019s rescue. He had already begun to forget the small things about them, the shape of their hands, the bend of their spine, the smell of their skin and the feeling of their hair between his fingers.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t wait to remember.</p><p>* * * *</p><p>Y/N knew that something was wrong the moment they woke up on the operating table, again. But this time was different.</p><p>There were no doctors leaning over them. No one shouting in another language before a suffocating face mask was placed onto them, sending them back into unconsciousness. Nobody.</p><p>They tugged against their metal restraints, unable to even lift their head an inch off the table. They let themselves go limp, waiting for the anesthesia to wear off and expose them to the pain of whatever the sadistic doctors had done to them.</p><p>The endless screeching of alarms bore into their head, the flashing lights bathing their bare body in red light. They could hear gunshots echoing in the distance, screams of terror and commands being shouted as <i>something</i> came closer and closer.</p><p>Y/N grit their teeth, considering the consequences of their actions before they opened their aching jaw and screamed, or tried to. Their voice was rusty from lack of use, their cries for help merely amounting to a feeble whimper.</p><p>They coughed loudly, trying to clear their throat.\u00a0\u201cHelp!\u201d they shouted once more, slightly louder. They grimaced as stabbing pains emanated from their chest. Cool air brushed against the exposed skin, causing the wound to sting slightly.</p><p>\u201cHelp!\u201d They yelled, voice rising in volume. They panted, panic coursing through their veins as they remained undiscovered.<br></p><p>Suddenly, the anesthesia wore off. Y/N\u2019s eyes rolled back as constant waves of pain radiated from their chest. Instinct kicked in and they screamed, a raw screech that would send shivers down the spine of any sane individual.</p><p>Their vision clouded as pain took over, pushing them to the edge of oblivion. They squeezed their eyes shut, trying to breathe past the agony through tightly clenched lips.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d a voice whispered. Their eyes flew open, searching the room.<br></p><p><i>Stupid, </i>they reprimanded themselves, <i>it\u2019s not real.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cY/N, oh god, Y/N,\u201d the voice sounded panicked, and Y/N could hear the soft sound of someone approaching. Something fumbled with the restraints, managing to unlock the tight metal cuffs.</p><p>Y/N rotated their wrists, enjoying the newfound movement. They looked up at their savior and the blood drained from their face.</p><p>It was Peter, wearing his Spider-Man getup. He ripped off his mask as he stood above them. Y/N allowed themselves to drink in his features. He looked as handsome as ever. His soft curls silhouetted his angled face, his thin lips were tightly pursed in concern. But something was different. His eyes were sunken in, darkened from nights of little sleep. His skin was ghostly pale, and the flashing red lights certainly didn\u2019t help.

Peter was sitting at the edge of the bed, trying to shake them awake. They sat up, tears welling up in their eyes as they believed their ordeal was over.

He had already begun to forget the small things about them, the shape of their hands, the bend of their spine, the smell of their skin and the feeling of their hair between his fingers.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t wait to remember.</p><p>* * * *</p><p>Y/N knew that something was wrong the moment they woke up on the operating table, again. But this time was different.</p><p>There were no doctors leaning over them. No one shouting in another language before a suffocating face mask was placed onto them, sending them back into unconsciousness. Nobody.</p><p>They tugged against their metal restraints, unable to even lift their head an inch off the table. They let themselves go limp, waiting for the anesthesia to wear off and expose them to the pain of whatever the sadistic doctors had done to them.</p><p>The endless screeching of alarms bore into their head, the flashing lights bathing their bare body in red light. They could hear gunshots echoing in the distance, screams of terror and commands being shouted as <i>something</i> came closer and closer.</p><p>Y/N grit their teeth, considering the consequences of their actions before they opened their aching jaw and screamed, or tried to. Their voice was rusty from lack of use, their cries for help merely amounting to a feeble whimper.</p><p>They coughed loudly, trying to clear their throat.\u00a0\u201cHelp!\u201d they shouted once more, slightly louder. They grimaced as stabbing pains emanated from their chest. Cool air brushed against the exposed skin, causing the wound to sting slightly.</p><p>\u201cHelp!\u201d They yelled, voice rising in volume. They panted, panic coursing through their veins as they remained undiscovered.<br></p><p>Suddenly, the anesthesia wore off. Y/N\u2019s eyes rolled back as constant waves of pain radiated from their chest. Instinct kicked in and they screamed, a raw screech that would send shivers down the spine of any sane individual.</p><p>Their vision clouded as pain took over, pushing them to the edge of oblivion. They squeezed their eyes shut, trying to breathe past the agony through tightly clenched lips.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d a voice whispered. Their eyes flew open, searching the room.<br></p><p><i>Stupid, </i>they reprimanded themselves, <i>it\u2019s not real.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cY/N, oh god, Y/N,\u201d the voice sounded panicked, and Y/N could hear the soft sound of someone approaching. Something fumbled with the restraints, managing to unlock the tight metal cuffs.</p><p>Y/N rotated their wrists, enjoying the newfound movement. They looked up at their savior and the blood drained from their face.</p><p>It was Peter, wearing his Spider-Man getup. He ripped off his mask as he stood above them. Y/N allowed themselves to drink in his features. He looked as handsome as ever. His soft curls silhouetted his angled face, his thin lips were tightly pursed in concern. But something was different. His eyes were sunken in, darkened from nights of little sleep. His skin was ghostly pale, and the flashing red lights certainly didn\u2019t help. But it was Peter, or at least it looked like him.</p><p>Y/N smiled weakly, tears sliding down their cheeks as they looked up at the love of their life.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Y/N, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Peter reassured, voice shaking with held back tears. He cupped their face with his hands, brushing their tears away with his thumbs.<br></p><p>Y/N leaned into his touch, closing their eyes in silent bliss.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get you out of here,\u201d he began to lift Y/N off the table.<br></p><p>\u201cNo, no!\u201d Y/N whimpered.<br></p><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d he apologized, suddenly noticing Y/N\u2019s opened chest cavity,\u00a0\u201cwe need to get this closed, can you heal it?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d Y/N took a shuddering breath,\u00a0\u201cthis isn\u2019t real.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Peter asked confusedly.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve-I\u2019ve hallucinated you before. You\u2019re not here. You\u2019re just not,\u201d they smiled weakly, cringing as their wound twinged slightly.<br></p><p>\u201cY/N no, this is real\u2013\u201d he said pleadingly.<br></p><p>\u201cYou said that before,\u201d Y/N interrupted, tears flowing without end,\u00a0\u201cI thought I was going to be rescued.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cPlease, Y/N please,\u201d Peter begged, grabbing Y/N\u2019s hand and squeezing it tightly,\u00a0\u201cI promise you, this is real.\u201d<br></p><p>Y/N stared up at him, they nodded reluctantly as they commanded their body to heal itself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get you someplace safe,\u201d Peter promised.<br></p><p>Y/N grabbed some discarded scrubs and slipped them on, leaning onto Peter for support.\u00a0</p><p>After Y/N had dressed, Peter pulled on his mask and lifted them up into his arms. Running out of the room he shouted into the comms,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve found them, I\u2019m heading to the jet.\u201d</p><p>Y/N buried their face into Peter\u2019s neck, murmuring something into the fabric of his suit.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Peter intoned, swinging through the base.<br></p><p>\u201c<b>You\u2019re my safe place</b>,\u201d Y/N said again, slightly louder.<br></p><p>Peter smiled inside his suit, finally feeling true happiness for the first time in months.</p><p>Y/N grinned as well, nuzzling against Peter as they felt some semblance of safety.</p><p>Peter was solid.</p><p>Peter was warm.</p><p>Peter was real.</p><p>As they slipped into unconsciousness, they did so with a smile.</p><p>* * * *</p><p>Y/N woke up in another hospital bed. They sat up, ripping the tubes out of their arms as they looked around in a panic. They swung their legs out from the bed, and were about to run before they were pulled into a tight embrace.</p><p>\u201cShush, it\u2019s me,\u201d Peter said softly, running his hand through their hair.<br></p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t-no-stop,\u201d they rasped, flashing back to every time they were forced into surgery.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe, I\u2019m here,\u201d he whispered, rocking Y/N slightly as they sobbed into his shoulder.<br></p><p>\u201cIt hurts,\u201d they mumbled, calming down in Peter\u2019s arms.<br></p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d Peter said soothingly.<br></p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d they begged,\u00a0\u201cstay.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d he reassured them, kissing their forehead gently. He rubbed their back methodically, relaxing them as they leaned into his chest.<br></p><p>They sat like that for hours, Peter gently lulling Y/N to sleep. Eventually, he slowly lay them back onto the bed, lovingly pulling the bed sheets to their chin. Y/N shifted slightly, clutching their knees to their stomach. Peter smiled and smoothed Y/N\u2019s hair back, kissing them on the cheek before sitting back in his chair.</p><p>\u201cLove you,\u201d he said quietly.<br></p><p>\u201cLove you too,\u201d Y/N slurred, opening their eyes drowsily.<br></p><p>He smiled slightly and caressed their cheek,\u00a0\u201cget some sleep, you need it.\u201d</p><p>Y/N nodded tiredly, drifting back down almost immediately.</p><p>He could hardly believe they were back. He wouldn\u2019t let them be hurt again.</p><p>Ever.</p>",

He rubbed their back methodically, relaxing them as they leaned into his chest.<br /></p><p>They sat like that for hours, Peter gently lulling Y/N to sleep. Eventually, he slowly lay them back onto the bed, lovingly pulling the bed sheets to their chin. Y/N shifted slightly, clutching their knees to their stomach. Peter smiled and smoothed Y/N&rsquo;s hair back, kissing them on the cheek before sitting back in his chair.</p><p>&ldquo;Love you,&rdquo; he said quietly.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Love you too,&rdquo; Y/N slurred, opening their eyes drowsily.<br /></p><p>He smiled slightly and caressed their cheek,&nbsp;&ldquo;get some sleep, you need it.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N nodded tiredly, drifting back down almost immediately.</p><p>He could hardly believe they were back.

But that didn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t hurt.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d And Ben meant it because behind the clumsiness he knew Peter was nothing but good through and through even at the age of 8 he would go out of his way for others even if it was just to sit with a kid who looked lonely at lunch. \u201cMaybe just a really clumsy one.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOw.\u201d May lifted the mask and Peter blinked his eyes before rubbing his nose. With a bit of first aid care and the promise of Thai takeout for dinner, Peter was back on his feet.

Peter hadn\u2019t been paying much attention instead playing with a new toy or gadget but as soon as those words left Tony Stark\u2019s mouth, Peter had swung his head around so fast that it looked like it might break.

They ran out quickly being ushered by security but the drama didn\u2019t end there, no the maniacs had brought it onto the street too. May and Ben had gotten so caught up in watching things explode left and right that they didn\u2019t even notice Peter run off, putting his iron man mask back on as he spotted a bad guy coming towards him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Peter felt the courage that only a little kid would, feeling brave he stuck out his hand because he wanted to be just like iron man, just like Tony Stark. But before he could fight of the bad guy with his fake iron man armour, a figure swooped down in front of him. For a second Peter thought it was another bad guy but then he caught a glimpse of the red and gold suit and Peter\u2019s eyes widened behind his mask. It was him, it was<i> iron man.\u00a0</i><br/></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the bad robot thing had been destroyed and Peter was so starstruck that he couldn\u2019t even think of two words to say to the man he had wanted to meet for so long.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou did good, kid.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Peter watched as iron man flew back into the sky after patting his shoulder. Peter\u2019s jaw was left open from shock. He had done it, he was a superhero and Iron Man had seen it, he had even praised him on it.<br/></p><p>\u201cPeter!\u201d He only faintly heard his Aunt\u2019s voice before it became louder. He frowned as she yelled. \u201cPeter don\u2019t run off like that! You could have been hurt!\u201d She instantly hugged him as his Uncle rested a hand on his shoulder reassuring himself that Peter was safe. He had gotten a firm lecture on not running off for the whole drive home. Peter rested his chin on his hand as he stared out the window, he watched 2 figures fly through the sky and he smiled.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI think what you did was brave Pete.\u201d Ben had whispered once they got home. \u201cStupid but brave. You were a superhero tonight, Petey.\u201d Ben winked at him as he kissed his nephews hair, watching his small face light up before he ran off to go to bed, his iron man helmet tucked tightly beneath his arm. May glared at her husband for backtracking but couldn\u2019t help but feel an awe at how happy Pete had been at the idea of being a superhero.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Peter looked at his helmet as he lay down in his bed, it was placed next to a few other superhero novelties and merchandise mainly iron man things. He smiled as he thought about the fact that not only had he met Iron Man but iron man had saved his life that night. \u201cThank you Iron Man.\u201d And Peter swore that if he was ever to become a superhero that he would be just as great as Iron Man was and with images of his own suit of armour filling his mind, he fell asleep, a small smile on his face.<br/></p><p>It wasn\u2019t until 6 years later that the pair would meet again and Peter was just as starstruck as he had been as a small 8 year old kid.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHi, I-I\u2019m Peter.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>That was the first time he had ever introduced himself to the hero, noting that Tony didn&rsquo;t and wouldn\u2019t remember Peter from all those years ago because he had been hidden behind his mask. But when Tony noticed the Iron Man helmet still sitting in Peter\u2019s room he had smiled and given a smirk to Peter who told him the story. Tony had laughed and patted Peter on the back.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still doing good, kid.\u201d<br/></p><p>Ben and May had been right, even if he one of them didn\u2019t get to see it, Peter did make a great superhero and the fact that he got to work with his childhood hero only made him better and happier.</p>",

His brain whirring with excitement as he looked up at his aunt and uncle both wearing matching smiles.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cReally?!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>The minute Aunt May nodded, Peter leapt up and wrapped them both in a tight hug. He bounded up and down, immediately rushing to his room to grab his wearable iron man helmet and matching glowing reactor glove.\u00a0<br></p><p>For the few days leading up to the expo, Peter\u2019s Aunt and Uncle watched with admiration and slight concern for their house as their nephew ran around the house as his idol superhero only occasionally knocking a vase or two.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cPeter slow down.\u201d Ben knelt to be eye level with excited kid and laughed. \u201cOtherwise you\u2019ll have too many broken bones to even go to the expo.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo I won\u2019t!\u201d Peter smirked under his mask as he put his hands on his hips in a superhero like pose. \u201cI am iron man.\u201d Peter nodded proudly, reiterating the famous words. And with that Peter was running around the house again yelling at the \u201cbad guys\u201d.\u00a0<br></p><p>Ben could only laugh as his wife put her hand on his shoulder and smiled. \u201cHe\u2019d make a good superhero, don\u2019t you think?\u201d At that moment, Peter tripped and face planted the floor, the mask taking most of the impact. But that didn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t hurt.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d And Ben meant it because behind the clumsiness he knew Peter was nothing but good through and through even at the age of 8 he would go out of his way for others even if it was just to sit with a kid who looked lonely at lunch. \u201cMaybe just a really clumsy one.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOw.\u201d May lifted the mask and Peter blinked his eyes before rubbing his nose. With a bit of first aid care and the promise of Thai takeout for dinner, Peter was back on his feet. They sat down that night and watched Star Wars, one of Peter\u2019s favourites that his uncle had introduced him to as Ben did with most films.\u00a0<br></p><p>When the day of the expo came, Peter couldn\u2019t hold his excitement, jumping on their bed at 6 in the morning screaming that they needed the whole day there.\u00a0<br></p><p>They had left 4 hours later, which Peter hadn\u2019t been happy about at all especially in the car as he listed everything they could potentially be missing. But as soon as they got there and those doors opened, his small annoyance left his mind. Peter\u2019s eyes widened and he let out a little gasp, running from one piece of tech to the next, not knowing what to do with himself.\u00a0<br></p><p>May had never been much of a fan of Stark industries or the man who ran it, it was more Ben and Peter\u2019s thing to nerd out over tech but even she had to admit it was pretty cool and it was nice to see Peter so happy.\u00a0<br></p><p>She remembered the day that they had watched the famous press conference on the news. Peter hadn\u2019t been paying much attention instead playing with a new toy or gadget but as soon as those words left Tony Stark\u2019s mouth, Peter had swung his head around so fast that it looked like it might break. Peter had been entranced as soon as he saw a real life superhero fly onto the television screen days before and ever since had been obsessed with the \u2018Iron man\u2019 and knowing that it was Tony Stark, the genius inventor only made it even cooler.\u00a0<br></p><p>Peter looked disappointed nearer the end of the day, noting that his hero wasn\u2019t there. \u201cHe was here last year!\u201d Peter moaned, kicking his foot a little, remembering the spectacular show he had seen on the TV. Ben patted him on the back and told him that they could always come again and that maybe Iron man was busy fighting bad guys. Peter smiled a bit after that and continued looking around.\u00a0<br></p><p>They had decided to give the presentations a miss especially as Peter gave a yawn but of course there had to be bathroom break which meant that they had gotten caught up  in the events of that evening just as they were exiting.<br></p><p>May screamed as the ceiling rained down with glass instantly grabbing Peter as Ben protected them both. They ran out quickly being ushered by security but the drama didn\u2019t end there, no the maniacs had brought it onto the street too. May and Ben had gotten so caught up in watching things explode left and right that they didn\u2019t even notice Peter run off, putting his iron man mask back on as he spotted a bad guy coming towards him.\u00a0<br></p><p>Peter felt the courage that only a little kid would, feeling brave he stuck out his hand because he wanted to be just like iron man, just like Tony Stark. But before he could fight of the bad guy with his fake iron man armour, a figure swooped down in front of him. For a second Peter thought it was another bad guy but then he caught a glimpse of the red and gold suit and Peter\u2019s eyes widened behind his mask. It was him, it was<i> iron man.\u00a0</i><br></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the bad robot thing had been destroyed and Peter was so starstruck that he couldn\u2019t even think of two words to say to the man he had wanted to meet for so long.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou did good, kid.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Peter watched as iron man flew back into the sky after patting his shoulder. Peter\u2019s jaw was left open from shock. He had done it, he was a superhero and Iron Man had seen it, he had even praised him on it.<br></p><p>\u201cPeter!\u201d He only faintly heard his Aunt\u2019s voice before it became louder. He frowned as she yelled. \u201cPeter don\u2019t run off like that! You could have been hurt!\u201d She instantly hugged him as his Uncle rested a hand on his shoulder reassuring himself that Peter was safe.
