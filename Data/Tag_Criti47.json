How stressed was Fjord losing his powers?</h2><p>0:10:06 Brian: \u201cTravis, Vega_The_Fool wants to know, \u2018On a scale of one to being dumped in a room alone with a blue dragon, how stressful was it for Fjord to wake up and find he\u2019s been depowered? On the same scale, how stressful was it for Travis Willingham to realize Fjord had been depowered?&lsquo;\u201d</p><p>0:10:25 Travis, passionately: \u201cYeah, look, they\u2019re one in the same, bitches! Okay? It was a ten! A fucking ten! A ten! It was terrible. It was awful. In the moment I was looking at Matt like, \u2018What are you\u2026?\u2019 I just- I thought maybe I was just getting, like, I don\u2019t know, nerfed or something, but to conjure nothing\u2026 I\u2019m a guy with a sword. I\u2019m a guy with a sword\u2026\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cI\u2019m convinced there\u2019s a 20-minute time period after that happened to you that you didn\u2019t hear a word said at the table.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cYeah, you might have to watch that back.\u201d</p><p>Travis, shaking his head: \u201cNope. Nope.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cI could tell just\u2026\u201d she mimics stressfully changing positions.</p><p>Brian: \u201cThat blankness, yeah.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cUh-huh. I\u2019m pretty sure I was movie breathing, too.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cLike,\u201d he breathes loudly and heavily. \u201cDuring the endgame Laura tapped me and she was like, \u2018Stop fucking breaking so loud.'\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cYeah yeah yeah.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cSomething I do. Big ass no.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cI almost broke Ashley\u2019s hand. I was holding her hand and five minutes into the movie I was squeezing it so hard she, like, peeled her fingers off and was like, \u2018Can you chill for a sec?\u2019 And I realized it was because she had a Milk Dud stuck in there that I really wanted. Were you going to say, Travis?\u201d</p><p>0:11:29 Travis: \u201cI was gonna say, blue dragon was like, \u2018Oh god, I might die. thank god people are coming.\u2019 But the\u2026 Not having any powers and Travis having a character that has no powers, yeah, not good! It\u2019s no good.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cI have been in haunted house situations with you before, I\u2019ve been in scary situations with you before, and I know when you sound terrified. And I was sitting there on my laptop watching the show, and when you ran out in the street and were like, \u2018Oh fuck, oh fuck,\u2019 I was like, \u2018Oh no, oh no, oh no!\u2019 It\u2019s cool. It\u2019s cool. I like it. I like it when you\u2019re going off a little bit.\u201d</p><p>0:12:03 Travis: \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m sure because, because, thanks to CritRoleStats, it\u2019s only been 35 days since, you know, since the last eye was placed that I have another 35 days before my next warning.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cNo, you don\u2019t know that\u2019s the case.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cYes. That is exactly what they said.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cReally it\u2019s been like 5 days since your last warning.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cIt\u2019s like a 90-day default period.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cThere\u2019s a verbal warning, and then there\u2019s a shot across the bow, okay? That was a shot. That was a physical\u2026\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cSo do you think they\u2019re just going to escalate, or do you think he\u2019s going to go back to verbal warnings?\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cLook, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s like, there\u2019s gonna be a flier that comes in the mailbox that\u2019ll be like, \u2018You have 90 days to reply to this. Your interest is\u2026'\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cYes. It\u2019s going to be so gentle.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cYou\u2019ll be sent to collections if you don\u2019t reply.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cIt\u2019s going to have a big thing on the front that says,\u201d Uk\u2019otoa voice, \u201c\u2018Reply.'\u201d</p><p>Travis, laughing: \u201cOpen it up and it\u2019s just one word.\u201d</p><p>Dani, quietly under Travis: \u201cUk\u2019otoa I feel is actually the IRS.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cSay it one more time, Dani.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cUk\u2019otoa is exactly the IRS. Never trust a phone call. They only send letters.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cThat\u2019s why they sealed him away.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cMore like the IRIS.\u201d</p><p>Marisha, after a pause: \u201cOh, iris, I get it. With it. Hip.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cOh no.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cOkay, because it\u2019s an eye and an eye has a-\u201c</p><p>0:13:07</p><p><br/></p><h2>2. Fjord is scared of losing both his friends and connection to Vandran</h2><p>0:16:56 Brian: \u201cTravis, CalicoJill, \u2018Fjord\u2019s fear of losing his powers is palpable, where does that fear lie? Is he worried he couldn\u2019t travel with his friends if he couldn\u2019t hold his own or that he\u2019d lose his last tangible connection to Vandran?'\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cGod, these fans and their fucking good questions.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cI know, man.\u201d</p><p>0:17:21Travis: \u201cYes. Both. I mean, yeah, he is temporarily satiated by the fact that Vandran seemed to be okay in Caduceus\u2019 vision, or that he is well and trying to atone for past mistakes. I\u2019d still really like to see the guy that, you know, treated him decent for the first time in his fucking life. Just say, \u2018Hey, what the hell happened? Glad you\u2019re okay. I\u2019m okay if you were wondering?\u201d</p><p>Dani, mournfully: \u201cOh-hoho.\u201d</p><p>0:17:52 Travis: \u201cWell yeah, you know. And then two, yeah, y\u2019all- we\u2019re some fucking dragon killing, like, badass 9th level motherfuckers. I\u2019m not if I don\u2019t have my shit! Right? If I just have a sword, I\u2019m a half-orc with a strength of 11. I\u2019m like a +1 with a sharp thing. It sucks! Yeah, nuh-uh.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cDo you regret picking your class?\u201d</p><p>0:18:21 Travis, animated: \u201cI regret all of it! It\u2019s all regerts all day every day! I just want out! Trade with me! Do it right now, shake on it. Let\u2019s [exercise this demon]. Do it!\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cI just want out! Trade with me!\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cNo! I\u2019d rather be a basic bitch than deal with some sort of demon.\u201d</p><p>Travis, pleading: \u201cPlease. Look, look I could do it, watch!\u201d He double punches the air. \u201cPap pap!</p><p>Dani: \u201cTrade that!?\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cNo!</p><p>Travis, double punching the air again: \u201cSee: pap pap! Flurry of blows!\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cYeah, isn\u2019t that great.</p><p>Dani: \u201cDid you say, \u2018Pap pap?'\u201d</p><p>Travis, undercutting the air twice: \u201cStunning strike! Ba bap!\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cYou see that has nothing beholden to my fists.\u201d</p><p>Travis, quietly stress and defeated: \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cNah dude.\u201d</p><p>0:18:49 Marisha: \u201cI felt really bad because as soon as the cameras went off, and I could see Travis\u2019s like freaking out and I\u2019m like the worst friend \u2019cause my first response was, \u2018This is why I\u2019ve never fucked with warlocks.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Travis, laughing: \u201cThat happened!\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cWow. Wow.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cAnd I was like,\u201d she looks at him. \u201cAnd he was just like,\u201d she braces herself with both hands on the coffee table and slowly looks back at him in disbelief.</p><p>Travis, slapping his leg laughing: \u201cThat was what you said! I looked over at Taliesin for some guidance, like, bro, like, I mean, we kicked Orthax out of your body and then killed it. I got no Orthax, I got nothing to kill, I got no nothing.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cI have no fire.\u201d</p><p>Laughter.</p><p>Travis: \u201cYeah.

I don\u2019t know if there were temples or other things that maybe I could pop in and go like, \u2018Hey, do you guys know anything about a giant snake dude called Uk\u2019otoa?'\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cCan I get a B12 shot?\u201d</p><p>Travis, laughing: \u201cYeah, seriously!\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cJust real quick.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cIs this the tent where they\u2019re doing the B12?\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cDo you ever reckon that wellness shot?

Fjords powers are defining who he is</h2><p>0:33:40 Travis: \u201cI mean, okay, I can say that Fjord\u2019s not an open- like, just a straight-up open book. He\u2019s\u2026 yeah. All these powers, when he has them, are defining who he is, right. It was really not anything close to that before. So yeah, he keeps it super close to the chest. Plus, people look to him in a\u2026 looked to him in a leadership role for a while. That\u2019s new to him, too. So, he thinks that, probably from his experiences with Vandran, that, like, stoic, quiet, calm leaders that don\u2019t show, you know, that don\u2019t blush in the face of adversity are how it\u2019s supposed to be. Not knowing that you can do it however the fuck you want to. there\u2019s no right way to lead.\u201d</p><p>0:34:23</p><p><br/></p><h2>6.

Yeah, it\u2019s, uh, yes. I see the bottom half of the question. Yeah, they\u2019ll think less of him. Who wouldn\u2019t, right? Everybody needs to be able to- No, Dani, they would! You\u2019ve gotta pull your own weight in this group.

Fjord\u2019s fallen in love with this version of himself</h2><p>0:42:31 Brian: \u201cThe only person that could save us now is Skidrule316. \u2018Travis, what is Fjord\u2019s apprehension about telling his friends about his dreams and the consequences of ignoring his patron?'\u201d</p><p>0:42:46 Travis: \u201cI mean\u2026 I think Fjord has fallen in love a little bit with the idea of who this new version of himself is. And being vulnerable and telling people what your biggest fear is and admitting all the ways that you suck, in addition to all the new reasons that you reallysuck, it\u2019s like one step too far. Plus, I mean, he gave it a day, right? He didn\u2019t just up and fucking run out in the middle of the night, although I was on the razor\u2019s edge of just tearing off into the darkness. I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know what the fuck was going to happen. So, conjuring that bird was a real good sign. But he\u2019s motivated to fix it. What was the back half of that question, the back part?\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cIt was about, \u2018Fjord\u2019s apprehension about telling his friends about his dreams and the consequences of ignoring his patron.\u2019</p><p>Travis: \u201cOh, the patron, yeah. I mean, that I have no- I don\u2019t have any idea about. I was looking for a temple. I don\u2019t know if anyone would have any idea of what Uk\u2019otoa is, or if they know how to break whatever agreement this thing is, if it is an agreement. I don\u2019t even remember it happening, so I don\u2019t know if he is\u2026\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cWhat happens if the agreement is broken though, dude?\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cI don\u2019t know.

I mean, from the day that happened until now, everything has been different and awesome because I can shoot shit out of my hands, and jump between planes, and change the way I look, and all of that.

Is there a significant attachment of his accent with his pact with Uk\u2019otoa? Is it heightened knowing that Vandran was also a chosen?

I told you, but we decided to leave this question in anyway.\u201d</p><p>0:47:30 Travis: \u201cYeah, I mean, it\u2019s definitely heightened with Vandran also being a chosen. I mean, we think. We think, right? I mean, from everything that Avantika said about Vandran, it sounded like he brought her into it. I don\u2019t know if he was a chosen or if he was brought into it the same way he brought her in; I don\u2019t know. But yeah, that\u2019s a huge connection to his past life and now. I mean how the hell is he even supposed to address finding him if he doesn\u2019t have the abilities or the thing that is the link to the last moment that he saw him in? I mean, we\u2019re on the other side of the fucking map. We\u2019re not even on the map, anymore.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cWe are upper north east adjacent.

You corrected me.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cA dwelling? A homestead?\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cYou have a dwelling.\u201d</p><p>0:54:49 Travis: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I- He- I feel\u2026 I feel good about it. As long as things stay the way they are he\u2019s pretty comfortable with this new life and family. But shit changes sometimes.\u201d He stares at Marisha helplessly.</p><p>Marisha, growing more concerned: \u201cYeah. Yeah. Yeah?\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cNot in a bad way, I mean, I\u2019m just speaking in a reference to my warlock abilities.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cHow does Beau feel- Wait, you seem so suspicious all the sudden.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cUhh\u2026\u201d She nudges her head at Travis.</p><p>0:55:24 Brian: \u201cA lot\u2019s going on up there, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>[\u2026]</p><p>0:57:08 Travis: \u201cYeah. I mean, genuinely Fjord is all about moving in solidifying things, embracing this new life. There is a big-ass maybe just floating out there though, now. Like, all of a sudden one morning nothing was like it was the night before, so I don\u2019t know what that means.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cWell, and it feels like you also had your found family before with Vandran.\u201d</p><p>0:57:31 Travis: \u201cYeah, and that shit ripped away.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cAnd that shit got ripped away.\u201d</p><p>0:57:34 Travis: \u201cYeah, totally. This is the third version of himself.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cSo, right. I can understand that through line of, well, you have this by blood, and theoretically they\u2019re not supposed to be able to be like \u2018nah\u2019 to you. Theoretically.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cTheoretically.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cTheoretically. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Travis, wincing: \u201cYeah. Yeah. Oh god.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cThere\u2019s just so much good character work.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cI\u2019m sure Mercer will take it away. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of deep character work going on. I like it. I want more.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cIt\u2019s all so tasty.

How stressed was Fjord losing his powers?</h2><p>0:10:06 Brian: \u201cTravis, Vega_The_Fool wants to know, \u2018On a scale of one to being dumped in a room alone with a blue dragon, how stressful was it for Fjord to wake up and find he\u2019s been depowered? On the same scale, how stressful was it for Travis Willingham to realize Fjord had been depowered?\u2018\u201d</p><p>0:10:25 Travis, passionately: \u201cYeah, look, they\u2019re one in the same, bitches! Okay? It was a ten! A fucking ten! A ten! It was terrible. It was awful. In the moment I was looking at Matt like, \u2018What are you\u2026?\u2019 I just- I thought maybe I was just getting, like, I don\u2019t know, nerfed or something, but to conjure nothing\u2026 I\u2019m a guy with a sword. I\u2019m a guy with a sword\u2026\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cI\u2019m convinced there\u2019s a 20-minute time period after that happened to you that you didn\u2019t hear a word said at the table.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cYeah, you might have to watch that back.\u201d</p><p>Travis, shaking his head: \u201cNope. Nope.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cI could tell just\u2026\u201d she mimics stressfully changing positions.</p><p>Brian: \u201cThat blankness, yeah.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cUh-huh. I\u2019m pretty sure I was movie breathing, too.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cLike,\u201d he breathes loudly and heavily. \u201cDuring the endgame Laura tapped me and she was like, \u2018Stop fucking breaking so loud.'\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cYeah yeah yeah.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cSomething I do. Big ass no.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cI almost broke Ashley\u2019s hand. I was holding her hand and five minutes into the movie I was squeezing it so hard she, like, peeled her fingers off and was like, \u2018Can you chill for a sec?\u2019 And I realized it was because she had a Milk Dud stuck in there that I really wanted. Were you going to say, Travis?\u201d</p><p>0:11:29 Travis: \u201cI was gonna say, blue dragon was like, \u2018Oh god, I might die. thank god people are coming.\u2019 But the\u2026 Not having any powers and Travis having a character that has no powers, yeah, not good! It\u2019s no good.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cI have been in haunted house situations with you before, I\u2019ve been in scary situations with you before, and I know when you sound terrified. And I was sitting there on my laptop watching the show, and when you ran out in the street and were like, \u2018Oh fuck, oh fuck,\u2019 I was like, \u2018Oh no, oh no, oh no!\u2019 It\u2019s cool. It\u2019s cool. I like it. I like it when you\u2019re going off a little bit.\u201d</p><p>0:12:03 Travis: \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m sure because, because, thanks to CritRoleStats, it\u2019s only been 35 days since, you know, since the last eye was placed that I have another 35 days before my next warning.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cNo, you don\u2019t know that\u2019s the case.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cYes. That is exactly what they said.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cReally it\u2019s been like 5 days since your last warning.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cIt\u2019s like a 90-day default period.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cThere\u2019s a verbal warning, and then there\u2019s a shot across the bow, okay? That was a shot. That was a physical\u2026\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cSo do you think they\u2019re just going to escalate, or do you think he\u2019s going to go back to verbal warnings?\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cLook, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s like, there\u2019s gonna be a flier that comes in the mailbox that\u2019ll be like, \u2018You have 90 days to reply to this. Your interest is\u2026'\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cYes. It\u2019s going to be so gentle.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cYou\u2019ll be sent to collections if you don\u2019t reply.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cIt\u2019s going to have a big thing on the front that says,\u201d Uk\u2019otoa voice, \u201c\u2018Reply.'\u201d</p><p>Travis, laughing: \u201cOpen it up and it\u2019s just one word.\u201d</p><p>Dani, quietly under Travis: \u201cUk\u2019otoa I feel is actually the IRS.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cSay it one more time, Dani.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cUk\u2019otoa is exactly the IRS. Never trust a phone call. They only send letters.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cThat\u2019s why they sealed him away.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cMore like the IRIS.\u201d</p><p>Marisha, after a pause: \u201cOh, iris, I get it. With it. Hip.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cOh no.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cOkay, because it\u2019s an eye and an eye has a-\u201c</p><p>0:13:07</p><p><br></p><h2>2. Fjord is scared of losing both his friends and connection to Vandran</h2><p>0:16:56 Brian: \u201cTravis, CalicoJill, \u2018Fjord\u2019s fear of losing his powers is palpable, where does that fear lie? Is he worried he couldn\u2019t travel with his friends if he couldn\u2019t hold his own or that he\u2019d lose his last tangible connection to Vandran?'\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cGod, these fans and their fucking good questions.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cI know, man.\u201d</p><p>0:17:21Travis: \u201cYes. Both. I mean, yeah, he is temporarily satiated by the fact that Vandran seemed to be okay in Caduceus\u2019 vision, or that he is well and trying to atone for past mistakes. I\u2019d still really like to see the guy that, you know, treated him decent for the first time in his fucking life. Just say, \u2018Hey, what the hell happened? Glad you\u2019re okay. I\u2019m okay if you were wondering?\u201d</p><p>Dani, mournfully: \u201cOh-hoho.\u201d</p><p>0:17:52 Travis: \u201cWell yeah, you know. And then two, yeah, y\u2019all- we\u2019re some fucking dragon killing, like, badass 9th level motherfuckers. I\u2019m not if I don\u2019t have my shit! Right? If I just have a sword, I\u2019m a half-orc with a strength of 11. I\u2019m like a +1 with a sharp thing. It sucks! Yeah, nuh-uh.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cDo you regret picking your class?\u201d</p><p>0:18:21 Travis, animated: \u201cI regret all of it! It\u2019s all regerts all day every day! I just want out! Trade with me! Do it right now, shake on it. Let\u2019s [exercise this demon]. Do it!\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cI just want out! Trade with me!\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cNo! I\u2019d rather be a basic bitch than deal with some sort of demon.\u201d</p><p>Travis, pleading: \u201cPlease. Look, look I could do it, watch!\u201d He double punches the air. \u201cPap pap!</p><p>Dani: \u201cTrade that!?\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cNo!</p><p>Travis, double punching the air again: \u201cSee: pap pap! Flurry of blows!\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cYeah, isn\u2019t that great.</p><p>Dani: \u201cDid you say, \u2018Pap pap?'\u201d</p><p>Travis, undercutting the air twice: \u201cStunning strike! Ba bap!\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cYou see that has nothing beholden to my fists.\u201d</p><p>Travis, quietly stress and defeated: \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cNah dude.\u201d</p><p>0:18:49 Marisha: \u201cI felt really bad because as soon as the cameras went off, and I could see Travis\u2019s like freaking out and I\u2019m like the worst friend \u2019cause my first response was, \u2018This is why I\u2019ve never fucked with warlocks.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Travis, laughing: \u201cThat happened!\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cWow. Wow.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cAnd I was like,\u201d she looks at him. \u201cAnd he was just like,\u201d she braces herself with both hands on the coffee table and slowly looks back at him in disbelief.</p><p>Travis, slapping his leg laughing: \u201cThat was what you said! I looked over at Taliesin for some guidance, like, bro, like, I mean, we kicked Orthax out of your body and then killed it. I got no Orthax, I got nothing to kill, I got no nothing.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cI have no fire.\u201d</p><p>Laughter.</p><p>Travis: \u201cYeah. Hey Korben my man.\u201d</p><p>Laughter.</p><p>Travis: \u201cYeah, yeah no it\u2019s panic around here.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cI love that that was your reaction. Like, yeah.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cYes, yeah.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cYour choice, eh.\u201d She throws up her hands.</p><p>0:19:32 Travis: \u201cHe cannot hang. He cannot hang. He would die real quick. If middle of the day, not like after a rest, I don\u2019t know if the wisdom check the night before had anything to do with it. If it\u2019s just like we\u2019re getting ready to ambush some people and all of a sudden, like, my sword just falls out of the air at my feet right as we\u2019re getting ready to go? I\u2019m\u2019a sit my ass right where we are and wish everyone good fortune.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cGood fjortune?\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cGood fjortune?

Fjord didn\u2019t want to see Wursh, it was an excuse for a crisis walkabout</h2><p>0:24:41 Brian: Micawindow, Fjord seemed anxious to leave the herbalist\u2019s and talk to Wursh. If he hadn\u2019t learned his powers returned when he created a minor illusion, would the conversation with Wursh have gone differently?\u201d</p><p>0:24:59 Travis: \u201cUh yeah. I only went to talk to Wursh \u2019cause fucking Yasha wouldn\u2019t leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cIt\u2019s true.

I can resolve it, but I need to do it on my own time, my own terms!\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cOoo. That is not a healthy way of thinking, Fjord.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cDid you, are you saying that to Fjord, right?

Fjords powers are defining who he is</h2><p>0:33:40 Travis: \u201cI mean, okay, I can say that Fjord\u2019s not an open- like, just a straight-up open book. He\u2019s\u2026 yeah. All these powers, when he has them, are defining who he is, right. It was really not anything close to that before. So yeah, he keeps it super close to the chest. Plus, people look to him in a\u2026 looked to him in a leadership role for a while. That\u2019s new to him, too. So, he thinks that, probably from his experiences with Vandran, that, like, stoic, quiet, calm leaders that don\u2019t show, you know, that don\u2019t blush in the face of adversity are how it\u2019s supposed to be. Not knowing that you can do it however the fuck you want to. there\u2019s no right way to lead.\u201d</p><p>0:34:23</p><p><br></p><h2>6. Everyone needs to pull their weight or they\u2019re out</h2><p>0:35:16 Brian: \u201cTravis, Dikemon asks, I\u2019m going to skip some of this, \u2018How much of his abilities does Fjord tie into his identity? Is he scares that the Nein might think less of him if he becomes powerless?'\u201d</p><p>[Full question: Travis: We\u2019ve seen Fjord grow more confident as his powers grew. 61 episodes in and those powers are threatened to be taken away. \u2018How much of his abilities does Fjord tie into his identity? Is he scares that the Nein might think less of him if he becomes powerless?]</p><p>0:35:26 Travis: \u201cThe guy shouts \u2018Eldritch Blast\u2019 when he doesn\u2019t have to. Yeah, it\u2019s, uh, yes. I see the bottom half of the question. Yeah, they\u2019ll think less of him. Who wouldn\u2019t, right? Everybody needs to be able to- No, Dani, they would! You\u2019ve gotta pull your own weight in this group. If you are the weak link, they\u2019re gonna hold auditions for The Mighty Eight.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cThe Might Eight?\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cYeah. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>Marisha, looking confused and concerned: \u201cNo, we wouldn\u2019t, though. You know that.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cNo. Nope.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cYou know that, but Fjord doesn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cI don\u2019t know. No, Fjord doesn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cDon\u2019t know. Caleb is\u2026 I mean, listen, I think Caleb evaluates all the group members, and because they can each contribute something to keeping each other safe, then it\u2019s a zero-sum game that everybody can, you know, they can take care of each other. If one person is going, \u2018I\u2019ve got a sword over here if any of you need it,\u2019 like a fucking ball boy,\u201d he slightly shakes his head.</p><p>Marisha: \u201cWell, look, you could have been our Caddy Shack for a few episodes, and we would have gone and got your powers back. We just quest for powers.\u201d</p><p>0:36:37 Travis: \u201cHow do you do that? How do you do that? How do you think you do that?\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cWe\u2026\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cWhere is Uk\u2019otoa to you?\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cWe toss you in some salt water.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cUh-huh.\u201d His body language says, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cLet you get a little\u2026\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cBriny?\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cSee what happens, go from there.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cHow long do we wait while I\u2019m in the ocean before you realize it\u2019s not doing shit?\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cMm, you know\u2026\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cA fortnight?\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cNot beyond the threshold of a Revivify.\u201d</p><p>Laughter.</p><p>Travis: \u201cOh god!\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cOh wow.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cYou\u2019re trying to reset the hard drive?

Like, none of us in the group have any idea how to approach or solve that problem. Nobody.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cYeah. Nobody.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cI mean, we\u2019re going to have to figure it out though.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cOnly if he tells y\u2019all! Fjord.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it. It\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cYou know when your- you know when your check engine light goes on?\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cEw. I don\u2019t think that one bit.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cThat\u2019s weird.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cStart counting down the days. My check engine light has been on for nine days, you guy.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll get it, it\u2019s fine. And then you take it into the shop they\u2019re like, \u2018How long\u2019s this been on?\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cUh\u2026 a few days.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cNovember?\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cPop the hood, I don\u2019t smell burning, we\u2019re good.

Those are the days I say someone\u2019s looking out for you.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cIt gave up.

Fjord\u2019s fallen in love with this version of himself</h2><p>0:42:31 Brian: \u201cThe only person that could save us now is Skidrule316. \u2018Travis, what is Fjord\u2019s apprehension about telling his friends about his dreams and the consequences of ignoring his patron?'\u201d</p><p>0:42:46 Travis: \u201cI mean\u2026 I think Fjord has fallen in love a little bit with the idea of who this new version of himself is. And being vulnerable and telling people what your biggest fear is and admitting all the ways that you suck, in addition to all the new reasons that you reallysuck, it\u2019s like one step too far. Plus, I mean, he gave it a day, right? He didn\u2019t just up and fucking run out in the middle of the night, although I was on the razor\u2019s edge of just tearing off into the darkness. I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know what the fuck was going to happen. So, conjuring that bird was a real good sign. But he\u2019s motivated to fix it. What was the back half of that question, the back part?\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cIt was about, \u2018Fjord\u2019s apprehension about telling his friends about his dreams and the consequences of ignoring his patron.\u2019</p><p>Travis: \u201cOh, the patron, yeah. I mean, that I have no- I don\u2019t have any idea about. I was looking for a temple. I don\u2019t know if anyone would have any idea of what Uk\u2019otoa is, or if they know how to break whatever agreement this thing is, if it is an agreement. I don\u2019t even remember it happening, so I don\u2019t know if he is\u2026\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cWhat happens if the agreement is broken though, dude?\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I mean\u2026\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cWe don\u2019t know that that\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cNo, we don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cBut we don\u2019t know that you\u2019re good, but now I\u2019m thinking you might turn good because this one\u2019s evil.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cNo, yeah. I mean, from the day that happened until now, everything has been different and awesome because I can shoot shit out of my hands, and jump between planes, and change the way I look, and all of that. If you told me I\u2019m just going back to being who I was before\u2026\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cNormal?\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cYeah. That\u2019s not awesome. It\u2019s not great.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cYeah. Yeah, that would suck.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cYeah. He still has work to do, too.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cNormal sucks. Right, Max?\u201d</p><p>Max: \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Laughter</p><p>0:44:42</p><p><br></p><h2>8. Uk\u2019otoa is a connection to Vandran and now</h2><p>0:46:55 Brian: \u201cLet\u2019s see, Travis, let\u2019s see if you- let\u2019s see what you can answer of this question from GracelessKnight. \u2018Fjord\u2019s accent dropped during his nervous breakdown outside. Is there a significant attachment of his accent with his pact with Uk\u2019otoa? Is it heightened knowing that Vandran was also a chosen? If so, how\u2019s he coping with those connection momentarily lost?'\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about an accent drop.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cI fucking knew that\u2019s what you were gonna fucking say! Goddamn it!\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cI told you. I told you he was gonna say it. I told you, but we decided to leave this question in anyway.\u201d</p><p>0:47:30 Travis: \u201cYeah, I mean, it\u2019s definitely heightened with Vandran also being a chosen. I mean, we think. We think, right? I mean, from everything that Avantika said about Vandran, it sounded like he brought her into it. I don\u2019t know if he was a chosen or if he was brought into it the same way he brought her in; I don\u2019t know. But yeah, that\u2019s a huge connection to his past life and now. I mean how the hell is he even supposed to address finding him if he doesn\u2019t have the abilities or the thing that is the link to the last moment that he saw him in? I mean, we\u2019re on the other side of the fucking map. We\u2019re not even on the map, anymore.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cWe are upper north east adjacent. We are out of bounds. For the moment.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cYeah, out of bounds. Return to gameplay please.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cYeah, he is far from home, yeah.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cReturn to the combat zone, please.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cYeah. Sixty seconds.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cAw, just like Spider-Man. He\u2019s far from home.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cYeah, that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cOh, Dani, oh\u2026\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cSpoilers.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cThat\u2019s the name of the movie!\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cYeah, but some of us\u2026\u201d</p><p>0:48:34</p><p><br></p><h2>9.

Get it get it girl. Get it girl. Get it get it girl. \u266a</p><p>Marisha, dancing: \u201cI\u2019m fly.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cI mean, sorry. He doesn\u2019t care. Nah.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cDoesn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>Travis, shrugging: \u201cNah.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cHit it and quit it, man.\u201d</p><p>Brain: \u2018Yeah, it wasn\u2019t the coat.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cIt\u2019s mine now, bitch!\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cKeep your enemies close.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cIt looks good, too.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the coat he had a wonderful evening with.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cThat\u2019s right, yeah.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cI mean it might have been. What?\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cIt\u2019s fur lined now, fits real nice, shows off my figure.\u201d</p><p>0:52:45 Travis: \u201cYeah, both Fjord and Travis don\u2019t put a lot of stock in new clothes.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cYeah, we can tell there.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cHe\u2019s probably like, \u2018Oh, is that Avantika\u2019s coat?'\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cI bought this in 2004, so\u2026\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cYou did?</p><p>Travis: \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cYeah yeah yeah.\u201d</p><p>0:52:55</p><p><br></p><h2>10. Home is a big-ass maybe</h2><p>0:54:30 Brian: \u201cLalalyssh wants to know, \u2018Fjord grew up an orphan and Beau was ostracized from her family. How do these characters feel now that they have been offered a home to share with their found family?\u2019 So, you guys have this home now. You know, it\u2019s not a house, as you said earlier. You corrected me.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cA dwelling? A homestead?\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cYou have a dwelling.\u201d</p><p>0:54:49 Travis: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I- He- I feel\u2026 I feel good about it. As long as things stay the way they are he\u2019s pretty comfortable with this new life and family. But shit changes sometimes.\u201d He stares at Marisha helplessly.</p><p>Marisha, growing more concerned: \u201cYeah. Yeah. Yeah?\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cNot in a bad way, I mean, I\u2019m just speaking in a reference to my warlock abilities.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cHow does Beau feel- Wait, you seem so suspicious all the sudden.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cUhh\u2026\u201d She nudges her head at Travis.</p><p>0:55:24 Brian: \u201cA lot\u2019s going on up there, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>[\u2026]</p><p>0:57:08 Travis: \u201cYeah. I mean, genuinely Fjord is all about moving in solidifying things, embracing this new life. There is a big-ass maybe just floating out there though, now. Like, all of a sudden one morning nothing was like it was the night before, so I don\u2019t know what that means.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cWell, and it feels like you also had your found family before with Vandran.\u201d</p><p>0:57:31 Travis: \u201cYeah, and that shit ripped away.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cAnd that shit got ripped away.\u201d</p><p>0:57:34 Travis: \u201cYeah, totally. This is the third version of himself.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cSo, right.

How stressed was Fjord losing his powers?</h2><p>0:10:06 Brian: \u201cTravis, Vega_The_Fool wants to know, \u2018On a scale of one to being dumped in a room alone with a blue dragon, how stressful was it for Fjord to wake up and find he\u2019s been depowered? On the same scale, how stressful was it for Travis Willingham to realize Fjord had been depowered?\u2018\u201d</p><p>0:10:25 Travis, passionately: \u201cYeah, look, they\u2019re one in the same, bitches! Okay? It was a ten! A fucking ten! A ten! It was terrible. It was awful. In the moment I was looking at Matt like, \u2018What are you\u2026?\u2019 I just- I thought maybe I was just getting, like, I don\u2019t know, nerfed or something, but to conjure nothing\u2026 I\u2019m a guy with a sword. I\u2019m a guy with a sword\u2026\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cI\u2019m convinced there\u2019s a 20-minute time period after that happened to you that you didn\u2019t hear a word said at the table.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cYeah, you might have to watch that back.\u201d</p><p>Travis, shaking his head: \u201cNope. Nope.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cI could tell just\u2026\u201d she mimics stressfully changing positions.</p><p>Brian: \u201cThat blankness, yeah.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cUh-huh. I\u2019m pretty sure I was movie breathing, too.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cLike,\u201d he breathes loudly and heavily. \u201cDuring the endgame Laura tapped me and she was like, \u2018Stop fucking breaking so loud.'\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cYeah yeah yeah.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cSomething I do. Big ass no.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cI almost broke Ashley\u2019s hand. I was holding her hand and five minutes into the movie I was squeezing it so hard she, like, peeled her fingers off and was like, \u2018Can you chill for a sec?\u2019 And I realized it was because she had a Milk Dud stuck in there that I really wanted. Were you going to say, Travis?\u201d</p><p>0:11:29 Travis: \u201cI was gonna say, blue dragon was like, \u2018Oh god, I might die. thank god people are coming.\u2019 But the\u2026 Not having any powers and Travis having a character that has no powers, yeah, not good! It\u2019s no good.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cI have been in haunted house situations with you before, I\u2019ve been in scary situations with you before, and I know when you sound terrified. And I was sitting there on my laptop watching the show, and when you ran out in the street and were like, \u2018Oh fuck, oh fuck,\u2019 I was like, \u2018Oh no, oh no, oh no!\u2019 It\u2019s cool. It\u2019s cool. I like it. I like it when you\u2019re going off a little bit.\u201d</p><p>0:12:03 Travis: \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m sure because, because, thanks to CritRoleStats, it\u2019s only been 35 days since, you know, since the last eye was placed that I have another 35 days before my next warning.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cNo, you don\u2019t know that\u2019s the case.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cYes. That is exactly what they said.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cReally it\u2019s been like 5 days since your last warning.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cIt\u2019s like a 90-day default period.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cThere\u2019s a verbal warning, and then there\u2019s a shot across the bow, okay? That was a shot. That was a physical\u2026\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cSo do you think they\u2019re just going to escalate, or do you think he\u2019s going to go back to verbal warnings?\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cLook, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s like, there\u2019s gonna be a flier that comes in the mailbox that\u2019ll be like, \u2018You have 90 days to reply to this. Your interest is\u2026'\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cYes. It\u2019s going to be so gentle.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cYou\u2019ll be sent to collections if you don\u2019t reply.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cIt\u2019s going to have a big thing on the front that says,\u201d Uk\u2019otoa voice, \u201c\u2018Reply.'\u201d</p><p>Travis, laughing: \u201cOpen it up and it\u2019s just one word.\u201d</p><p>Dani, quietly under Travis: \u201cUk\u2019otoa I feel is actually the IRS.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cSay it one more time, Dani.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cUk\u2019otoa is exactly the IRS. Never trust a phone call. They only send letters.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cThat\u2019s why they sealed him away.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cMore like the IRIS.\u201d</p><p>Marisha, after a pause: \u201cOh, iris, I get it. With it. Hip.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cOh no.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cOkay, because it\u2019s an eye and an eye has a-\u201c</p><p>0:13:07</p><p><br></p><h2>2. Fjord is scared of losing both his friends and connection to Vandran</h2><p>0:16:56 Brian: \u201cTravis, CalicoJill, \u2018Fjord\u2019s fear of losing his powers is palpable, where does that fear lie? Is he worried he couldn\u2019t travel with his friends if he couldn\u2019t hold his own or that he\u2019d lose his last tangible connection to Vandran?'\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cGod, these fans and their fucking good questions.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cI know, man.\u201d</p><p>0:17:21Travis: \u201cYes. Both. I mean, yeah, he is temporarily satiated by the fact that Vandran seemed to be okay in Caduceus\u2019 vision, or that he is well and trying to atone for past mistakes. I\u2019d still really like to see the guy that, you know, treated him decent for the first time in his fucking life. Just say, \u2018Hey, what the hell happened? Glad you\u2019re okay. I\u2019m okay if you were wondering?\u201d</p><p>Dani, mournfully: \u201cOh-hoho.\u201d</p><p>0:17:52 Travis: \u201cWell yeah, you know. And then two, yeah, y\u2019all- we\u2019re some fucking dragon killing, like, badass 9th level motherfuckers. I\u2019m not if I don\u2019t have my shit! Right? If I just have a sword, I\u2019m a half-orc with a strength of 11. I\u2019m like a +1 with a sharp thing. It sucks! Yeah, nuh-uh.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cDo you regret picking your class?\u201d</p><p>0:18:21 Travis, animated: \u201cI regret all of it! It\u2019s all regerts all day every day! I just want out! Trade with me! Do it right now, shake on it. Let\u2019s [exercise this demon]. Do it!\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cI just want out! Trade with me!\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cNo! I\u2019d rather be a basic bitch than deal with some sort of demon.\u201d</p><p>Travis, pleading: \u201cPlease. Look, look I could do it, watch!\u201d He double punches the air. \u201cPap pap!</p><p>Dani: \u201cTrade that!?\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cNo!</p><p>Travis, double punching the air again: \u201cSee: pap pap! Flurry of blows!\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cYeah, isn\u2019t that great.</p><p>Dani: \u201cDid you say, \u2018Pap pap?'\u201d</p><p>Travis, undercutting the air twice: \u201cStunning strike! Ba bap!\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cYou see that has nothing beholden to my fists.\u201d</p><p>Travis, quietly stress and defeated: \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cNah dude.\u201d</p><p>0:18:49 Marisha: \u201cI felt really bad because as soon as the cameras went off, and I could see Travis\u2019s like freaking out and I\u2019m like the worst friend \u2019cause my first response was, \u2018This is why I\u2019ve never fucked with warlocks.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Travis, laughing: \u201cThat happened!\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cWow. Wow.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cAnd I was like,\u201d she looks at him. \u201cAnd he was just like,\u201d she braces herself with both hands on the coffee table and slowly looks back at him in disbelief.</p><p>Travis, slapping his leg laughing: \u201cThat was what you said! I looked over at Taliesin for some guidance, like, bro, like, I mean, we kicked Orthax out of your body and then killed it. I got no Orthax, I got nothing to kill, I got no nothing.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cI have no fire.\u201d</p><p>Laughter.</p><p>Travis: \u201cYeah. Hey Korben my man.\u201d</p><p>Laughter.</p><p>Travis: \u201cYeah, yeah no it\u2019s panic around here.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cI love that that was your reaction. Like, yeah.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cYes, yeah.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cYour choice, eh.\u201d She throws up her hands.</p><p>0:19:32 Travis: \u201cHe cannot hang. He cannot hang. He would die real quick. If middle of the day, not like after a rest, I don\u2019t know if the wisdom check the night before had anything to do with it. If it\u2019s just like we\u2019re getting ready to ambush some people and all of a sudden, like, my sword just falls out of the air at my feet right as we\u2019re getting ready to go? I\u2019m\u2019a sit my ass right where we are and wish everyone good fortune.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cGood fjortune?\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cGood fjortune? Oh, good- oh fjork you, Dani.\u201d</p><p>Dani cackles.</p><p>Brian: \u201cOh boy. Oh boy.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cNeed my powers, man.\u201d</p><p>0:20:10</p><p><br></p><h2>3. Maybe we\u2019ve misjudged Uk\u2019otoa</h2><p>0:23:29 Travis: \u201cListen, maybe we\u2019re being too judgmental of poor, misunderstood Uk\u2019otoa, right?\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cOkay, that line of thinking is bound to get you in a world of shit.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cMaybe we just go, and we drop that third sphere, we let the little, the little snake guy out of his cage he just\u2026\u201d He makes a slithering motion.</p><p>Brian: \u201cNo. You\u2019ve seen Prometheus.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cNo. Nobody saw that.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cI was about to say, I was like, \u2018Did you?'\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cSteve, you saw Prometheus?\u201d</p><p>Steve: \u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cYou yeah, yeah?\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cIf you, like, suck another eyeball inside of you, and we kill him, though, do you get to keep his powers?\u201d</p><p>0:24:01 Travis, stress laughing: \u201cI don\u2019t know! I didn\u2019t read the contract! There wasn\u2019t one!\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cI have a question.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cWas there a contract? Or did you just wake up and you suddenly fucking had powers.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cI think there was some nasty shit in this.\u201d</p><p>0:24:13 Travis: \u201cIt was the latter as far as I know.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cYou woke up?\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cSo you just don\u2019t- so you also- so it\u2019s like what y\u2019all were talking about with those memory loss- memory-\u201c</p><p>0:24:22 Travis: \u201cYeah, I was drowning. and it hurt like a motherfucker, and the next thing I knew I was awake on a shore and there\u2019s a sword just washing up in the waves.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cShould have had gills, man. Should have had gills like that Sea Quest character. You would be fine. This one\u2019s for Travis.\u201d</p><p>Marisha and Travis, laughing: \u201cSea Quest?\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cHere comes Lockey to remind us.\u201d</p><p><br></p><h2>4. Fjord didn\u2019t want to see Wursh, it was an excuse for a crisis walkabout</h2><p>0:24:41 Brian: Micawindow, Fjord seemed anxious to leave the herbalist\u2019s and talk to Wursh. If he hadn\u2019t learned his powers returned when he created a minor illusion, would the conversation with Wursh have gone differently?\u201d</p><p>0:24:59 Travis: \u201cUh yeah. I only went to talk to Wursh \u2019cause fucking Yasha wouldn\u2019t leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cIt\u2019s true. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cI was trying to fucking-</p><p>Marisha: \u201cWait, what, really?\u201d</p><p>0:25:09 Travis: \u201cYeah! I don\u2019t give a fuck about Wursh! I was trying to amscray!\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cYou forgot about Wursh. Forgot about Wursh.\u201d</p><p>0:25:14 Travis: \u201cNo, I was gonna ask- Yasha was like, \u2018I\u2019m gonna follow Fjord.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Fuck!\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m going to talk to Wursh right now. That is my only intention.'\u201d</p><p>Marisha, laughing: \u201cYou were trying to have a crisis walkabout and\u2026\u201d</p><p>0:25:28 Travis: \u201cYeah! That\u2019s why I was getting so impatient! Shit is going down, alright!? The clock is ticking! I don\u2019t need to share it with you guys! I can resolve it, but I need to do it on my own time, my own terms!\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cOoo. That is not a healthy way of thinking, Fjord.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cDid you, are you saying that to Fjord, right? Travis is a very responsible person and a good friend.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cI was about to\u2026\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cNothing\u201d</p><p>[They gently browbeat Marisha into talking.]</p><p>Marisha: \u201cJust didn\u2019t know if we were talking to Travis of Fjord.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cI know, he\u2019s got more accents than Liam\u2019s character has names.\u201d</p><p>0:26:26 Travis: \u201cWell, and listen, half of it was I was asking about what was in the town because as we walk through, we\u2019ve just kind of been moving to one place and the other, not really taking inventory of what\u2019s around. I don\u2019t know if there were temples or other things that maybe I could pop in and go like, \u2018Hey, do you guys know anything about a giant snake dude called Uk\u2019otoa?'\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cCan I get a B12 shot?\u201d</p><p>Travis, laughing: \u201cYeah, seriously!\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cJust real quick.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cIs this the tent where they\u2019re doing the B12?\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cDo you ever reckon that wellness shot? Can we get some\u2026\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cUniversal healthcare, right?\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>0:26:59</p><p><br></p><h2>5. Fjords powers are defining who he is</h2><p>0:33:40 Travis: \u201cI mean, okay, I can say that Fjord\u2019s not an open- like, just a straight-up open book. He\u2019s\u2026 yeah. All these powers, when he has them, are defining who he is, right. It was really not anything close to that before. So yeah, he keeps it super close to the chest. Plus, people look to him in a\u2026 looked to him in a leadership role for a while. That\u2019s new to him, too. So, he thinks that, probably from his experiences with Vandran, that, like, stoic, quiet, calm leaders that don\u2019t show, you know, that don\u2019t blush in the face of adversity are how it\u2019s supposed to be. Not knowing that you can do it however the fuck you want to. there\u2019s no right way to lead.\u201d</p><p>0:34:23</p><p><br></p><h2>6. Everyone needs to pull their weight or they\u2019re out</h2><p>0:35:16 Brian: \u201cTravis, Dikemon asks, I\u2019m going to skip some of this, \u2018How much of his abilities does Fjord tie into his identity? Is he scares that the Nein might think less of him if he becomes powerless?'\u201d</p><p>[Full question: Travis: We\u2019ve seen Fjord grow more confident as his powers grew. 61 episodes in and those powers are threatened to be taken away. \u2018How much of his abilities does Fjord tie into his identity? Is he scares that the Nein might think less of him if he becomes powerless?]</p><p>0:35:26 Travis: \u201cThe guy shouts \u2018Eldritch Blast\u2019 when he doesn\u2019t have to. Yeah, it\u2019s, uh, yes. I see the bottom half of the question. Yeah, they\u2019ll think less of him. Who wouldn\u2019t, right? Everybody needs to be able to- No, Dani, they would! You\u2019ve gotta pull your own weight in this group. If you are the weak link, they\u2019re gonna hold auditions for The Mighty Eight.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cThe Might Eight?\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cYeah. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>Marisha, looking confused and concerned: \u201cNo, we wouldn\u2019t, though. You know that.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cNo. Nope.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cYou know that, but Fjord doesn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cI don\u2019t know. No, Fjord doesn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cDon\u2019t know. Caleb is\u2026 I mean, listen, I think Caleb evaluates all the group members, and because they can each contribute something to keeping each other safe, then it\u2019s a zero-sum game that everybody can, you know, they can take care of each other. If one person is going, \u2018I\u2019ve got a sword over here if any of you need it,\u2019 like a fucking ball boy,\u201d he slightly shakes his head.</p><p>Marisha: \u201cWell, look, you could have been our Caddy Shack for a few episodes, and we would have gone and got your powers back. We just quest for powers.\u201d</p><p>0:36:37 Travis: \u201cHow do you do that? How do you do that? How do you think you do that?\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cWe\u2026\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cWhere is Uk\u2019otoa to you?\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cWe toss you in some salt water.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cUh-huh.\u201d His body language says, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cLet you get a little\u2026\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cBriny?\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cSee what happens, go from there.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cHow long do we wait while I\u2019m in the ocean before you realize it\u2019s not doing shit?\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cMm, you know\u2026\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cA fortnight?\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cNot beyond the threshold of a Revivify.\u201d</p><p>Laughter.</p><p>Travis: \u201cOh god!\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cOh wow.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cYou\u2019re trying to reset the hard drive?

Reformat disk.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cTurn him off and tuning him back on!\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cYeah, you\u2019re turning the computer off and holding the power button down factory settings.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cFuck you guys. He\u2019s blue screened.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cDisk utility.

This has had no R&amp;D. Okay? I\u2019m not saying we go with our first draft. We think about it. I was just tossing it out.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cCampaign 2: now with more Eternal Sunshine on a Spotless Mind.\u201d</p><p>0:37:51 Travis: \u201cYeah. this is what I was doing in the game in the moments where my head was exploding. Like, none of us in the group have any idea how to approach or solve that problem. Nobody.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cYeah. Nobody.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cI mean, we\u2019re going to have to figure it out though.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cOnly if he tells y\u2019all! Fjord.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it. It\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cYou know when your- you know when your check engine light goes on?\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cEw. I don\u2019t think that one bit.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cThat\u2019s weird.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cStart counting down the days. My check engine light has been on for nine days, you guy.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll get it, it\u2019s fine. And then you take it into the shop they\u2019re like, \u2018How long\u2019s this been on?\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cUh\u2026 a few days.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cNovember?\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cPop the hood, I don\u2019t smell burning, we\u2019re good.

Those are the days I say someone\u2019s looking out for you.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cIt gave up. The check engine light gives up, that car\u2019s going to explode.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cSpeaking from experience.\u201d</p><p>0:38:52</p><p><br></p><h2>7. Fjord\u2019s fallen in love with this version of himself</h2><p>0:42:31 Brian: \u201cThe only person that could save us now is Skidrule316. \u2018Travis, what is Fjord\u2019s apprehension about telling his friends about his dreams and the consequences of ignoring his patron?'\u201d</p><p>0:42:46 Travis: \u201cI mean\u2026 I think Fjord has fallen in love a little bit with the idea of who this new version of himself is. And being vulnerable and telling people what your biggest fear is and admitting all the ways that you suck, in addition to all the new reasons that you reallysuck, it\u2019s like one step too far. Plus, I mean, he gave it a day, right? He didn\u2019t just up and fucking run out in the middle of the night, although I was on the razor\u2019s edge of just tearing off into the darkness. I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know what the fuck was going to happen. So, conjuring that bird was a real good sign. But he\u2019s motivated to fix it. What was the back half of that question, the back part?\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cIt was about, \u2018Fjord\u2019s apprehension about telling his friends about his dreams and the consequences of ignoring his patron.\u2019</p><p>Travis: \u201cOh, the patron, yeah. I mean, that I have no- I don\u2019t have any idea about. I was looking for a temple. I don\u2019t know if anyone would have any idea of what Uk\u2019otoa is, or if they know how to break whatever agreement this thing is, if it is an agreement. I don\u2019t even remember it happening, so I don\u2019t know if he is\u2026\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cWhat happens if the agreement is broken though, dude?\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I mean\u2026\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cWe don\u2019t know that that\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cNo, we don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cBut we don\u2019t know that you\u2019re good, but now I\u2019m thinking you might turn good because this one\u2019s evil.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cNo, yeah. I mean, from the day that happened until now, everything has been different and awesome because I can shoot shit out of my hands, and jump between planes, and change the way I look, and all of that. If you told me I\u2019m just going back to being who I was before\u2026\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cNormal?\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cYeah. That\u2019s not awesome. It\u2019s not great.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cYeah. Yeah, that would suck.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cYeah. He still has work to do, too.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cNormal sucks. Right, Max?\u201d</p><p>Max: \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Laughter</p><p>0:44:42</p><p><br></p><h2>8. Uk\u2019otoa is a connection to Vandran and now</h2><p>0:46:55 Brian: \u201cLet\u2019s see, Travis, let\u2019s see if you- let\u2019s see what you can answer of this question from GracelessKnight. \u2018Fjord\u2019s accent dropped during his nervous breakdown outside. Is there a significant attachment of his accent with his pact with Uk\u2019otoa? Is it heightened knowing that Vandran was also a chosen? If so, how\u2019s he coping with those connection momentarily lost?'\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about an accent drop.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cI fucking knew that\u2019s what you were gonna fucking say! Goddamn it!\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cI told you. I told you he was gonna say it. I told you, but we decided to leave this question in anyway.\u201d</p><p>0:47:30 Travis: \u201cYeah, I mean, it\u2019s definitely heightened with Vandran also being a chosen. I mean, we think. We think, right? I mean, from everything that Avantika said about Vandran, it sounded like he brought her into it. I don\u2019t know if he was a chosen or if he was brought into it the same way he brought her in; I don\u2019t know. But yeah, that\u2019s a huge connection to his past life and now. I mean how the hell is he even supposed to address finding him if he doesn\u2019t have the abilities or the thing that is the link to the last moment that he saw him in? I mean, we\u2019re on the other side of the fucking map. We\u2019re not even on the map, anymore.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cWe are upper north east adjacent. We are out of bounds. For the moment.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cYeah, out of bounds. Return to gameplay please.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cYeah, he is far from home, yeah.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cReturn to the combat zone, please.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cYeah. Sixty seconds.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cAw, just like Spider-Man. He\u2019s far from home.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cYeah, that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cOh, Dani, oh\u2026\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cSpoilers.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cThat\u2019s the name of the movie!\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cYeah, but some of us\u2026\u201d</p><p>0:48:34</p><p><br></p><h2>9.

Get it get it girl. Get it girl. Get it get it girl. \u266a</p><p>Marisha, dancing: \u201cI\u2019m fly.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cI mean, sorry. He doesn\u2019t care. Nah.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cDoesn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>Travis, shrugging: \u201cNah.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cHit it and quit it, man.\u201d</p><p>Brain: \u2018Yeah, it wasn\u2019t the coat.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cIt\u2019s mine now, bitch!\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cKeep your enemies close.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cIt looks good, too.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the coat he had a wonderful evening with.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cThat\u2019s right, yeah.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cI mean it might have been. What?\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cIt\u2019s fur lined now, fits real nice, shows off my figure.\u201d</p><p>0:52:45 Travis: \u201cYeah, both Fjord and Travis don\u2019t put a lot of stock in new clothes.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cYeah, we can tell there.\u201d</p><p>Dani: \u201cHe\u2019s probably like, \u2018Oh, is that Avantika\u2019s coat?'\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cI bought this in 2004, so\u2026\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cYou did?</p><p>Travis: \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cYeah yeah yeah.\u201d</p><p>0:52:55</p><p><br></p><h2>10. Home is a big-ass maybe</h2><p>0:54:30 Brian: \u201cLalalyssh wants to know, \u2018Fjord grew up an orphan and Beau was ostracized from her family. How do these characters feel now that they have been offered a home to share with their found family?\u2019 So, you guys have this home now. You know, it\u2019s not a house, as you said earlier. You corrected me.\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cA dwelling? A homestead?\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cYou have a dwelling.\u201d</p><p>0:54:49 Travis: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I- He- I feel\u2026 I feel good about it. As long as things stay the way they are he\u2019s pretty comfortable with this new life and family. But shit changes sometimes.\u201d He stares at Marisha helplessly.</p><p>Marisha, growing more concerned: \u201cYeah. Yeah. Yeah?\u201d</p><p>Travis: \u201cNot in a bad way, I mean, I\u2019m just speaking in a reference to my warlock abilities.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Brian: \u201cHow does Beau feel- Wait, you seem so suspicious all the sudden.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cUhh\u2026\u201d She nudges her head at Travis.</p><p>0:55:24 Brian: \u201cA lot\u2019s going on up there, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>[\u2026]</p><p>0:57:08 Travis: \u201cYeah. I mean, genuinely Fjord is all about moving in solidifying things, embracing this new life. There is a big-ass maybe just floating out there though, now. Like, all of a sudden one morning nothing was like it was the night before, so I don\u2019t know what that means.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cWell, and it feels like you also had your found family before with Vandran.\u201d</p><p>0:57:31 Travis: \u201cYeah, and that shit ripped away.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cAnd that shit got ripped away.\u201d</p><p>0:57:34 Travis: \u201cYeah, totally. This is the third version of himself.\u201d</p><p>Marisha: \u201cSo, right. I can understand that through line of, well, you have this by blood, and theoretically they\u2019re not supposed to be able to be like \u2018nah\u2019 to you.

How stressed was Fjord losing his powers?</h2><p>0:10:06 Brian: &ldquo;Travis, Vega_The_Fool wants to know, &lsquo;On a scale of one to being dumped in a room alone with a blue dragon, how stressful was it for Fjord to wake up and find he&rsquo;s been depowered? On the same scale, how stressful was it for Travis Willingham to realize Fjord had been depowered?&lsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>0:10:25 Travis, passionately: &ldquo;Yeah, look, they&rsquo;re one in the same, bitches! Okay? It was a ten! A fucking ten! A ten! It was terrible. It was awful. In the moment I was looking at Matt like, &lsquo;What are you&hellip;?&rsquo; I just- I thought maybe I was just getting, like, I don&rsquo;t know, nerfed or something, but to conjure nothing&hellip; I&rsquo;m a guy with a sword. I&rsquo;m a guy with a sword&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Marisha: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m convinced there&rsquo;s a 20-minute time period after that happened to you that you didn&rsquo;t hear a word said at the table.&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;Yeah, you might have to watch that back.&rdquo;</p><p>Travis, shaking his head: &ldquo;Nope.

Big ass no.&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;I almost broke Ashley&rsquo;s hand. I was holding her hand and five minutes into the movie I was squeezing it so hard she, like, peeled her fingers off and was like, &lsquo;Can you chill for a sec?&rsquo; And I realized it was because she had a Milk Dud stuck in there that I really wanted. Were you going to say, Travis?&rdquo;</p><p>0:11:29 Travis: &ldquo;I was gonna say, blue dragon was like, &lsquo;Oh god, I might die. thank god people are coming.&rsquo; But the&hellip; Not having any powers and Travis having a character that has no powers, yeah, not good!

Ba bap!&rdquo;</p><p>Marisha: &ldquo;You see that has nothing beholden to my fists.&rdquo;</p><p>Travis, quietly stress and defeated: &ldquo;Shit.&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;Nah dude.&rdquo;</p><p>0:18:49 Marisha: &ldquo;I felt really bad because as soon as the cameras went off, and I could see Travis&rsquo;s like freaking out and I&rsquo;m like the worst friend &rsquo;cause my first response was, &lsquo;This is why I&rsquo;ve never fucked with warlocks.&rdquo;</p><p>Dani: &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>Travis, laughing: &ldquo;That happened!&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;Wow. Wow.&rdquo;</p><p>Marisha: &ldquo;And I was like,&rdquo; she looks at him. &ldquo;And he was just like,&rdquo; she braces herself with both hands on the coffee table and slowly looks back at him in disbelief.</p><p>Travis, slapping his leg laughing: &ldquo;That was what you said! I looked over at Taliesin for some guidance, like, bro, like, I mean, we kicked Orthax out of your body and then killed it. I got no Orthax, I got nothing to kill, I got no nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;I have no fire.&rdquo;</p><p>Laughter.</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;Yeah. Hey Korben my man.&rdquo;</p><p>Laughter.</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;Yeah, yeah no it&rsquo;s panic around here.&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;I love that that was your reaction. Like, yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;Yes, yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>Marisha: &ldquo;Your choice, eh.&rdquo; She throws up her hands.</p><p>0:19:32 Travis: &ldquo;He cannot hang. He cannot hang. He would die real quick. If middle of the day, not like after a rest, I don&rsquo;t know if the wisdom check the night before had anything to do with it. If it&rsquo;s just like we&rsquo;re getting ready to ambush some people and all of a sudden, like, my sword just falls out of the air at my feet right as we&rsquo;re getting ready to go? I&rsquo;m&rsquo;a sit my ass right where we are and wish everyone good fortune.&rdquo;</p><p>Dani: &ldquo;Good fjortune?&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;Good fjortune? Oh, good- oh fjork you, Dani.&rdquo;</p><p>Dani cackles.</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;Oh boy. Oh boy.&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;Need my powers, man.&rdquo;</p><p>0:20:10</p><p><br /></p><h2>3. Maybe we&rsquo;ve misjudged Uk&rsquo;otoa</h2><p>0:23:29 Travis: &ldquo;Listen, maybe we&rsquo;re being too judgmental of poor, misunderstood Uk&rsquo;otoa, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;Okay, that line of thinking is bound to get you in a world of shit.&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;Maybe we just go, and we drop that third sphere, we let the little, the little snake guy out of his cage he just&hellip;&rdquo; He makes a slithering motion.</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;No. You&rsquo;ve seen Prometheus.&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;No. Nobody saw that.&rdquo;</p><p>Dani: &ldquo;I was about to say, I was like, &lsquo;Did you?'&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;Steve, you saw Prometheus?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve: &ldquo;Yeah, yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;You yeah, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>Marisha: &ldquo;If you, like, suck another eyeball inside of you, and we kill him, though, do you get to keep his powers?&rdquo;</p><p>0:24:01 Travis, stress laughing: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know! I didn&rsquo;t read the contract! There wasn&rsquo;t one!&rdquo;</p><p>Dani: &ldquo;I have a question.&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>Dani: &ldquo;Was there a contract? Or did you just wake up and you suddenly fucking had powers.&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;I think there was some nasty shit in this.&rdquo;</p><p>0:24:13 Travis: &ldquo;It was the latter as far as I know.&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;You woke up?&rdquo;</p><p>Dani: &ldquo;So you just don&rsquo;t- so you also- so it&rsquo;s like what y&rsquo;all were talking about with those memory loss- memory-&ldquo;</p><p>0:24:22 Travis: &ldquo;Yeah, I was drowning. and it hurt like a motherfucker, and the next thing I knew I was awake on a shore and there&rsquo;s a sword just washing up in the waves.&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;Should have had gills, man. Should have had gills like that Sea Quest character. You would be fine. This one&rsquo;s for Travis.&rdquo;</p><p>Marisha and Travis, laughing: &ldquo;Sea Quest?&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;Here comes Lockey to remind us.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><h2>4. Fjord didn&rsquo;t want to see Wursh, it was an excuse for a crisis walkabout</h2><p>0:24:41 Brian: Micawindow, Fjord seemed anxious to leave the herbalist&rsquo;s and talk to Wursh. If he hadn&rsquo;t learned his powers returned when he created a minor illusion, would the conversation with Wursh have gone differently?&rdquo;</p><p>0:24:59 Travis: &ldquo;Uh yeah. I only went to talk to Wursh &rsquo;cause fucking Yasha wouldn&rsquo;t leave me alone.&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true. Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;I was trying to fucking-</p><p>Marisha: &ldquo;Wait, what, really?&rdquo;</p><p>0:25:09 Travis: &ldquo;Yeah! I don&rsquo;t give a fuck about Wursh! I was trying to amscray!&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;You forgot about Wursh. Forgot about Wursh.&rdquo;</p><p>0:25:14 Travis: &ldquo;No, I was gonna ask- Yasha was like, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m gonna follow Fjord.&rsquo; And I&rsquo;m like, &lsquo;Fuck!&rsquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to talk to Wursh right now. That is my only intention.'&rdquo;</p><p>Marisha, laughing: &ldquo;You were trying to have a crisis walkabout and&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>0:25:28 Travis: &ldquo;Yeah! That&rsquo;s why I was getting so impatient! Shit is going down, alright!? The clock is ticking! I don&rsquo;t need to share it with you guys! I can resolve it, but I need to do it on my own time, my own terms!&rdquo;</p><p>Dani: &ldquo;Ooo. That is not a healthy way of thinking, Fjord.&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;Did you, are you saying that to Fjord, right? Travis is a very responsible person and a good friend.&rdquo;</p><p>Marisha: &ldquo;I was about to&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>Marisha: &ldquo;Nothing&rdquo;</p><p>[They gently browbeat Marisha into talking.]</p><p>Marisha: &ldquo;Just didn&rsquo;t know if we were talking to Travis of Fjord.&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;I know, he&rsquo;s got more accents than Liam&rsquo;s character has names.&rdquo;</p><p>0:26:26 Travis: &ldquo;Well, and listen, half of it was I was asking about what was in the town because as we walk through, we&rsquo;ve just kind of been moving to one place and the other, not really taking inventory of what&rsquo;s around. I don&rsquo;t know if there were temples or other things that maybe I could pop in and go like, &lsquo;Hey, do you guys know anything about a giant snake dude called Uk&rsquo;otoa?'&rdquo;</p><p>Marisha: &ldquo;Can I get a B12 shot?&rdquo;</p><p>Travis, laughing: &ldquo;Yeah, seriously!&rdquo;</p><p>Marisha: &ldquo;Just real quick.&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;Is this the tent where they&rsquo;re doing the B12?&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;Do you ever reckon that wellness shot? Can we get some&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Marisha: &ldquo;Universal healthcare, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p><p>0:26:59</p><p><br /></p><h2>5. Fjords powers are defining who he is</h2><p>0:33:40 Travis: &ldquo;I mean, okay, I can say that Fjord&rsquo;s not an open- like, just a straight-up open book. He&rsquo;s&hellip; yeah. All these powers, when he has them, are defining who he is, right. It was really not anything close to that before. So yeah, he keeps it super close to the chest. Plus, people look to him in a&hellip; looked to him in a leadership role for a while. That&rsquo;s new to him, too. So, he thinks that, probably from his experiences with Vandran, that, like, stoic, quiet, calm leaders that don&rsquo;t show, you know, that don&rsquo;t blush in the face of adversity are how it&rsquo;s supposed to be. Not knowing that you can do it however the fuck you want to. there&rsquo;s no right way to lead.&rdquo;</p><p>0:34:23</p><p><br /></p><h2>6. Everyone needs to pull their weight or they&rsquo;re out</h2><p>0:35:16 Brian: &ldquo;Travis, Dikemon asks, I&rsquo;m going to skip some of this, &lsquo;How much of his abilities does Fjord tie into his identity? Is he scares that the Nein might think less of him if he becomes powerless?'&rdquo;</p><p>[Full question: Travis: We&rsquo;ve seen Fjord grow more confident as his powers grew. 61 episodes in and those powers are threatened to be taken away. &lsquo;How much of his abilities does Fjord tie into his identity? Is he scares that the Nein might think less of him if he becomes powerless?]</p><p>0:35:26 Travis: &ldquo;The guy shouts &lsquo;Eldritch Blast&rsquo; when he doesn&rsquo;t have to. Yeah, it&rsquo;s, uh, yes. I see the bottom half of the question. Yeah, they&rsquo;ll think less of him. Who wouldn&rsquo;t, right? Everybody needs to be able to- No, Dani, they would! You&rsquo;ve gotta pull your own weight in this group. If you are the weak link, they&rsquo;re gonna hold auditions for The Mighty Eight.&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;The Might Eight?&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;Yeah. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening.&rdquo;</p><p>Marisha, looking confused and concerned: &ldquo;No, we wouldn&rsquo;t, though. You know that.&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;No. Nope.&rdquo;</p><p>Marisha: &ldquo;You know that, but Fjord doesn&rsquo;t know that.&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. No, Fjord doesn&rsquo;t know that.&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. Caleb is&hellip; I mean, listen, I think Caleb evaluates all the group members, and because they can each contribute something to keeping each other safe, then it&rsquo;s a zero-sum game that everybody can, you know, they can take care of each other. If one person is going, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got a sword over here if any of you need it,&rsquo; like a fucking ball boy,&rdquo; he slightly shakes his head.</p><p>Marisha: &ldquo;Well, look, you could have been our Caddy Shack for a few episodes, and we would have gone and got your powers back. We just quest for powers.&rdquo;</p><p>0:36:37 Travis: &ldquo;How do you do that? How do you do that? How do you think you do that?&rdquo;</p><p>Marisha: &ldquo;We&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;Where is Uk&rsquo;otoa to you?&rdquo;</p><p>Marisha: &ldquo;We toss you in some salt water.&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;Uh-huh.&rdquo; His body language says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p>Marisha: &ldquo;Let you get a little&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;Briny?&rdquo;</p><p>Marisha: &ldquo;Uh-huh.&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;Uh-huh.&rdquo;</p><p>Marisha: &ldquo;See what happens, go from there.&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;How long do we wait while I&rsquo;m in the ocean before you realize it&rsquo;s not doing shit?&rdquo;</p><p>Marisha: &ldquo;Mm, you know&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;A fortnight?&rdquo;</p><p>Marisha: &ldquo;Not beyond the threshold of a Revivify.&rdquo;</p><p>Laughter.</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;Oh god!&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;Oh wow.&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to reset the hard drive? Like, you&rsquo;re just going to- okay. Okay cool.&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re thinking just like&hellip; You&rsquo;re thinking reformat disk. Reformat disk.&rdquo;</p><p>Dani: &ldquo;Turn him off and tuning him back on!&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;re turning the computer off and holding the power button down factory settings.&rdquo;</p><p>Marisha: &ldquo;Fuck you guys. He&rsquo;s blue screened.&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;Disk utility. Yikes.&rdquo;</p><p>Dani: &ldquo;Aw, think how much Beau loves Fjord that she would be willing to factory reset him.&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;Wow.&rdquo;</p><p>Dani: &ldquo;Aw, I think it&rsquo;s sweet.&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;Wow, that is some&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Dani: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just going to throw you in the water, buddy.&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait.&rdquo;</p><p>Marisha: &ldquo;Look, this was a 60-second plan. This has had no R&amp;D. Okay? I&rsquo;m not saying we go with our first draft. We think about it. I was just tossing it out.&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;Campaign 2: now with more Eternal Sunshine on a Spotless Mind.&rdquo;</p><p>0:37:51 Travis: &ldquo;Yeah. this is what I was doing in the game in the moments where my head was exploding. Like, none of us in the group have any idea how to approach or solve that problem. Nobody.&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;Yeah. Nobody.&rdquo;</p><p>Marisha: &ldquo;I mean, we&rsquo;re going to have to figure it out though.&rdquo;</p><p>Dani: &ldquo;Only if he tells y&rsquo;all! Fjord.&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of it. It&rsquo;ll be fine. I&rsquo;ll take care of it.&rdquo;</p><p>Marisha: &ldquo;You know when your- you know when your check engine light goes on?&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;Ew. I don&rsquo;t think that one bit.&rdquo;</p><p>Dani: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s weird.&rdquo;</p><p>Marisha: &ldquo;Start counting down the days. My check engine light has been on for nine days, you guy.&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;ll get it, it&rsquo;s fine. And then you take it into the shop they&rsquo;re like, &lsquo;How long&rsquo;s this been on?&rdquo;</p><p>Marisha: &ldquo;Uh&hellip; a few days.&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;November?&rdquo;</p><p>Marisha: &ldquo;Pop the hood, I don&rsquo;t smell burning, we&rsquo;re good. We&rsquo;re good.&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</p><p>Dani: &ldquo;The freakiest days are the ones where the check engine light turns off. And then you&rsquo;re like, &lsquo;Eh, that&rsquo;s weird. That&rsquo;s worse.'&rdquo;</p><p>Marisha: &ldquo;Yeah. Those are the days I say someone&rsquo;s looking out for you.&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;It gave up. The check engine light gives up, that car&rsquo;s going to explode.&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;Speaking from experience.&rdquo;</p><p>0:38:52</p><p><br /></p><h2>7. Fjord&rsquo;s fallen in love with this version of himself</h2><p>0:42:31 Brian: &ldquo;The only person that could save us now is Skidrule316. &lsquo;Travis, what is Fjord&rsquo;s apprehension about telling his friends about his dreams and the consequences of ignoring his patron?'&rdquo;</p><p>0:42:46 Travis: &ldquo;I mean&hellip; I think Fjord has fallen in love a little bit with the idea of who this new version of himself is. And being vulnerable and telling people what your biggest fear is and admitting all the ways that you suck, in addition to all the new reasons that you reallysuck, it&rsquo;s like one step too far. Plus, I mean, he gave it a day, right? He didn&rsquo;t just up and fucking run out in the middle of the night, although I was on the razor&rsquo;s edge of just tearing off into the darkness. I don&rsquo;t know. I didn&rsquo;t know what the fuck was going to happen. So, conjuring that bird was a real good sign. But he&rsquo;s motivated to fix it. What was the back half of that question, the back part?&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;It was about, &lsquo;Fjord&rsquo;s apprehension about telling his friends about his dreams and the consequences of ignoring his patron.&rsquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;Oh, the patron, yeah. I mean, that I have no- I don&rsquo;t have any idea about. I was looking for a temple. I don&rsquo;t know if anyone would have any idea of what Uk&rsquo;otoa is, or if they know how to break whatever agreement this thing is, if it is an agreement. I don&rsquo;t even remember it happening, so I don&rsquo;t know if he is&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;What happens if the agreement is broken though, dude?&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I mean&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know that that&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t know that you&rsquo;re good, but now I&rsquo;m thinking you might turn good because this one&rsquo;s evil.&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;No, yeah. I mean, from the day that happened until now, everything has been different and awesome because I can shoot shit out of my hands, and jump between planes, and change the way I look, and all of that. If you told me I&rsquo;m just going back to being who I was before&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Marisha: &ldquo;Normal?&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;Yeah. That&rsquo;s not awesome. It&rsquo;s not great.&rdquo;</p><p>Marisha: &ldquo;Yeah. Yeah, that would suck.&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;Yeah. He still has work to do, too.&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;Normal sucks. Right, Max?&rdquo;</p><p>Max: &ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p><p>Laughter</p><p>0:44:42</p><p><br /></p><h2>8. Uk&rsquo;otoa is a connection to Vandran and now</h2><p>0:46:55 Brian: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see, Travis, let&rsquo;s see if you- let&rsquo;s see what you can answer of this question from GracelessKnight. &lsquo;Fjord&rsquo;s accent dropped during his nervous breakdown outside. Is there a significant attachment of his accent with his pact with Uk&rsquo;otoa? Is it heightened knowing that Vandran was also a chosen? If so, how&rsquo;s he coping with those connection momentarily lost?'&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about an accent drop.&rdquo;</p><p>Dani: &ldquo;I fucking knew that&rsquo;s what you were gonna fucking say! Goddamn it!&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;I told you. I told you he was gonna say it. I told you, but we decided to leave this question in anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>0:47:30 Travis: &ldquo;Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s definitely heightened with Vandran also being a chosen. I mean, we think. We think, right? I mean, from everything that Avantika said about Vandran, it sounded like he brought her into it. I don&rsquo;t know if he was a chosen or if he was brought into it the same way he brought her in; I don&rsquo;t know. But yeah, that&rsquo;s a huge connection to his past life and now. I mean how the hell is he even supposed to address finding him if he doesn&rsquo;t have the abilities or the thing that is the link to the last moment that he saw him in? I mean, we&rsquo;re on the other side of the fucking map. We&rsquo;re not even on the map, anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>Dani: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;We are upper north east adjacent. We are out of bounds. For the moment.&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;Yeah, out of bounds. Return to gameplay please.&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;Yeah, he is far from home, yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;Return to the combat zone, please.&rdquo;</p><p>Marisha: &ldquo;Yeah. Sixty seconds.&rdquo;</p><p>Dani: &ldquo;Aw, just like Spider-Man. He&rsquo;s far from home.&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;Oh, Dani, oh&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;Spoilers.&rdquo;</p><p>Dani: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the name of the movie!&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;Yeah, but some of us&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>0:48:34</p><p><br /></p><h2>9.

What?&rdquo;</p><p>Marisha: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fur lined now, fits real nice, shows off my figure.&rdquo;</p><p>0:52:45 Travis: &ldquo;Yeah, both Fjord and Travis don&rsquo;t put a lot of stock in new clothes.&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;Yeah, we can tell there.&rdquo;</p><p>Dani: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s probably like, &lsquo;Oh, is that Avantika&rsquo;s coat?'&rdquo;</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;I bought this in 2004, so&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;You did?</p><p>Travis: &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>Brian: &ldquo;Yeah yeah yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>0:52:55</p><p><br /></p><h2>10. Home is a big-ass maybe</h2><p>0:54:30 Brian: &ldquo;Lalalyssh wants to know, &lsquo;Fjord grew up an orphan and Beau was ostracized from her family.
