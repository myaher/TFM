The thunderous claps of the\nsky filled the ears of the people in the city, along with Rheagar\u2019s who watched\nas his little sister was born; a silver haired beauty with puffy pink lips,\nswollen from the journey she made into the world.<br/></p><p>He watched as his mother lay in the birthing bed, unmoving\nand stiff. The color from her rose kissed cheeks was dulling to a pale white as\nblood soaked into the fine sheets that would take the servants weeks to wash\nout. He would have to burn them, he didn\u2019t want them around. He didn\u2019t want to\nremember how he lost his mother. </p><p>The gods, if there were any, were cruel to take his mother\nfrom him in the same fashion that they took his beloved, Lyanna. </p><p>He recalled that night all too well. The way she whimpered quietly\nas she pleaded with Rhaegar to take care of her child. How she cried softly at\nthe sight of the raven-haired boy gently nestled in Rheagar\u2019s strong arms. And\nthen the quiet intake of her last breath as the Stranger took her. </p><p>In the empty halls of the Red Keep, the wind whistled, and\nthe rain pattered against the hard stone, he could vaguely hear the whisper of\nher voice once more. Of his Lyanna, his winter rose. </p><p>The whispers were drowned out by the sounds of his father\u2019s\nshouting coming from his own room, \u201cBurn them all!\u201d</p><p>He sighed heavily as he held his little sister in his hands,\nhis mind feeling as though it would sooner fall out of its place in his skull\nthe longer, he heard the shouts. He wondered if he could quell the unrest that\nwas stirring within the kingdoms.</p><p>It was no secret that King Aerys was\u2026 unruly. Even he was\nfilled with unease whenever the thought that his father might become more\nunhinged plagued him. </p><p>In the darkness, in his own quarters that he shared with\nLyanna, he knew his own son, Aegon, slept soundly. </p><p>So close in age. </p><p>One of fire, and one of ice. </p><p>He took after his mother, with the dark hair and the dark\neyes. He was a northerner. A true northerner. If there was a splash of his own\nTargaryen blood within his own child, it would be in his character. It would be\nin how he chose to lead. </p><p>He had to do something. Not just for his sister, or his son,\nbut for the people of Westeros. He had to take the throne from his father and\nrule, as much as he dreaded it. As much as he\u2019d rather lay in the ground with\nhis beloved Lyanna, he had to fulfill his destiny. As did his sister. His\nbrother. And his son.</p><p>\u201cBurn them all!\u201d</p><p>The words made him cringe inside, and cool chill traveled up\nhis spine as he slowly closed his eyes, sighing heavily with sorrow. </p><p>Gently, he handed his baby sister, Daenerys, to the wet\nnurse that watched him with sad eyes, \u201cSee to it that she\u2019s well taken care of.\nI will be back for her in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Your Grace,\u201d the older lady squeaked as she took\nthe child from him. </p><p>Like the proud prince that he was, his head held high and\nthe Targaryen blood of the dragon flowing though him, he glided his way to his\nfather\u2019s quarters, his resolve stiff and true.</p><p>He had to do the right thing.</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p><b>Aegon Targaryen</b></p><p>A boy of ten with a full head of curls and deep brown eyes\nwatched the young girl with flowing silver hair from the other end of the table\nas she practiced her penmanship. She sat beside his brother, Egg, and his\nsister Rhaenys. But his attention wasn\u2019t on them, it was on her; he watched as\nher delicate hand curved the letters on the parchment, glistening with ink in\nthe bright sunlight that shone through the open courtyard as Grand Maester\nPycelle droned on about the lineage and ancestry of the Targaryens, and their\ndominion over Westeros.</p><p>It was a story he\u2019d heard many times before, he could recite\nthe stories in his head word for word the way Grand Maester Pycelle spoke them,\nin his old, exhausted, heavy voice. </p><p>The Grand Maester\u2019s words were echoes in his ears, his eyes\nfocused on the girl as she listened intently to what the old man said, although\nshe had heard them many times before. She remained patient, in awe, as if all\nof this was the first time, she had heard it spoken. She loved the stories, he\nrecalled. She had told him as such. She had always dreamed of having her own\ndragons to ride, of course, that would be impossible. </p><p>All the dragons were dead. </p><p>\u201cI, I must say it is time for a spot of lunch,\u201d Pycelle\ndroned, bringing Jon out of his thought process, aware that Daenerys\u2019 eyes\nimmediately shot up to meet his. His eyes darted to the stones on the ground,\nwatching the toes of his fine leather boots with too much concentration.</p><p>He could feel her watching him with those kind violet eyes\nof hers. From the corner of his eye, he could see the gentlest of smiles begin\nto cross her puffy, pink lips.</p><p>\u201cEgg Jon!\u201d</p><p>His head immediately shot up to glance at Viserys Targaryen\ngallanting towards him, wooden swords clutched in each hand. He stared at the\nboy, almost with envy. Viserys was his uncle, and though the silver haired boy\nwas 5 years older than he, and they were rivaled in the art of swordsmanship,\neveryone secretly agreed that Aegon was better.</p><p>But he had the regal Targaryen look that his father had;\nviolet eyes, silver hair. They were beautiful, there was no denying that. And\nViserys made sure to remind him that he was an outsider. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a true Targaryen, look at you, you don\u2019t even\nhave the looks of a king,\u201d he would say as he puffed his chest out and adjusted\nhis silks and leather, \u201cNot like me.\u201d</p><p>Aegon turned and glanced down at the drying ink on parchment\nas he worked on his penmanship, \u201cWhat do you want Viserys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s spar,\u201d he said, tapping him on the back with a wooden\nsword, \u201cC\u2019mon, I\u2019ve been practicing, and I need someone to knock into the\ndirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m busy,\u201d Aegon sighed, writing his name on the parchment.\n</p><p><i>Aegon Targaryen. </i></p><p><i>Why did father name\nhim and his half-brother the same name? </i></p><p>He couldn\u2019t figure it out, and his father refused to talk\nabout it. Nevertheless, Viserys was the first person to begin calling him Jon,\nit began as a simple mispronunciation, though he would never admit it. </p><p><i>Eh-Jon</i> was how he\npronounced it, not <i>Egg-On</i>.</p><p>Since then, the name stuck. But he knew better, as time went\non, Viserys meant it more as an insult. </p><p>Viserys glanced down at the markings on the parchment, \u201cJust\nlike your footwork, your linework is awful. I suppose that\u2019s what happens when\na Targaryen tumbles with a northerner. I heard they\u2019re all savages\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut your mouth, Viserys.\u201d</p><p>The room went silent. Daenerys, who was sitting across the\ntable from him stared up at the boys with wide, worried eyes. Rhaenys and his brother,\nEgg, tensed, and slowly readied themselves for a fight; Aegon wasn\u2019t the only\none that was a victim of Viserys\u2019 constant bullying. Grand Maester Pycelle\nbreathed heavily as he began, \u201cN-now children\u2014\u201d</p><p>A sudden sting shot up from his hand to his arm as the\nwooden sword came down on him, hard. Jon shouted in agony, and in an instant,\nViserys was on the ground as Jon\u2019s fist connected with his stupid, kingly face.\n</p><p><i>Stupid boy.</i></p><p><i>Stupid silver haired\nboy.</i></p><p><i>Stupid Targaryens.</i></p><p>Viserys shouted, bringing up the wooden sword and hitting\nhim across the face with it, but Jon continued pummeling his fist into the\nsilver haired boy\u2019s face until he felt strong hands beneath him, he kicked and\nthrashed in the arms of the man who carried him, fighting to be set free\nto \u00a0beat the smug Viserys within an inch\nof his life. </p><p>Amidst the chaos and the shouting, he lost interest in\nViserys Targaryen. His own eyes fell on another pair of violet eyes, eyes that\nglanced at him with sorrow and remorse as she kneeled beside her brother,\nbrushing his hair back in her hands.</p><p><br/></p><hr><p>\u201cA prince does not behave in such a manner,\u201d his father\nlectured. </p><p>Once King Rhaegar Targaryen heard of the altercation, Aegon\nknew he would be in trouble. His father consistently reminded him and\nreprimanded him when he behaved as anything other than the Prince he was, and\nthe King he was going to become.</p><p>\u201cHe said my mother was a savage,\u201d Aegon pouted, kicking the\nwooden beam of his four-poster canopy bed, \u201cI should have cut his tongue out\nlike Ser Illyn\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Aegon!\u201d</p><p>Jon paused in his steps, jumping up slightly from the sound\nof his father\u2019s raised voice. Rhaegar Targaryen very rarely raised his voice at\nhim, so he knew now that he had crossed a line. </p><p>\u201cForgive me, father, I was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to forgive, child,\u201d his father said,\nbeckoning him to take a seat beside him on the soft, feather bed. Aegon slowly\ndragged his feet towards the bed, jumping up beside his father as he placed a\nstrong arm around his small shoulders, \u201cViserys is your uncle, and as wrong as\nit was for him to say what he said, that does not warrant a reaction from you.\nIf you are to be a King one day, you need to learn to take what others have to\nsay about you in stride, you are above words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said I wasn\u2019t a real Targaryen, because I don\u2019t look\nlike you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d his father ordered. Hesitantly, Aegon looked\nup into his father\u2019s vibrant violet eyes, \u201cYou are a Targaryen. You have the\nblood of the dragon, but you\u2019re also a wolf, just as your mother was. That does\nnot change the fact that you will rule, and with ruling comes being wise to\nchoose your battles, and strong enough to avoid the words that others have to\nsay about you. You will marry Rhaenys, and together you will continue to build\nthe Targaryen dynasty.\u201d</p><p>Aegon\u2019s brows furrowed at the words, \u201c<i>Rhaenys</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you not pleased?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2014 I just\u2014 why Rhaenys?\u201d</p><p>His father\u2019s silver brows crinkled at his question, \u201cThe\nTargaryens have always wed members of their families\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you married my mother. And before that, Lady Elia. They\nweren\u2019t members of your family,\u201d Aegon pointed. </p><p>He could see the unrest in his father as he rubbed his face\nwith his hand, smirking to himself in amusement, \u201cIs this about Daenerys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? NO!\u201d Jon shouted in embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re upset that Viserys is to marry her, I know\nthat\u2019s the reason why you\u2019re not too fond of him and why you fight him every\nopportunity you get,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe that as it may, Daenerys is to wed Viserys when they\ncome of age, and you will wed Rhaenys. She is of Dornish descent, and they did\nnot take too kindly the fact that I annulled my marriage to Lady Elia. You must\nfix the mess I created with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it a mistake then, marrying my mother and having me?\u201d</p><p>Aegon felt his father\u2019s strong arms tighten around him, \u201cYou\nand your mother were never, and will never be mistakes.\u201d</p><p>Aegon looked down at his feet, nodding. He wasn\u2019t sure if he\nfelt better, or worse. </p><p>\u201cNo more fighting with Viserys, promise me,\u201d his father\nordered.</p><p>Sighing, Aegon reluctantly nodded, \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, and I will make certain he puts an end to his vile behavior\nas well. In the meantime, you are confined to your quarters to think about what\nwe\u2019ve talked about and you\u2019ve done. I\u2019ll have the servants bring your supper.\u201d</p><p>For hours after, the young boy stared up at the canopy of\nhis bed, bored and frustrated with being locked in his room. The food that the\nservants brought him remained untouched on the table across his bed. </p><p>The sound of the gentle rapping coming from his door nudged\nhim from his thoughtful stupor; his brows knitted in confusion when he saw her\ntiny figure emerge, a candle in her hand as she made her way towards his bed.\nHe sat up, staring at the little girl with wide eyes, \u201cDaenerys? What are you\ndoing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see how you were doing,\u201d she whispered, bringing\nthe candlelight to his face, observing the small marks that Viserys left on\nhim, \u201cYou\u2019re doing a lot better than Viserys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you here to tell me I shouldn\u2019t have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to tell you anything, other than sorry for\nwhat he said,\u201d she gently said.</p><p>Aegon\u2019s eyes narrowed in confusion, \u201cWhy are you sorry? It\u2019s\nnot <i>your </i>fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s jealous of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat still doesn\u2019t have anything to do with <i>you</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows you like me, Aegon,\u201d she spoke, making the boy\nflinch at her boldness.</p><p>He swallowed hard as he stared at her, his voice a slight\nwhisper as he replied, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t give him a reason to be jealous.\u201d</p><p>She smiled softly, placing the candle holder on the table\nnext to the bed and crossing her legs as she leaned in, whispering a secret,\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be the King of the Seven Kingdoms, of all of Westeros, and\nhe\u2019s not. He thinks he deserves it more than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be.\u201d</p><p>Aegon\u2019s deep brown eyes bore into the light, violet crystals\nthat were Daenerys\u2019s eyes. How could he not like her?</p><p>She was always beautiful, and kind. And bold. She was the\nonly one who didn\u2019t treat him as an outsider; even Rhaenys and Egg treated him\nlike an outsider. </p><p>But not her.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all have to do things we don\u2019t want to, Aegon.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flew back up to hers, \u201cLike marry Viserys?\u201d</p><p>He watched her tense at his name, and Aegon narrowed his\neyes suspiciously, \u201cI\u2019ll do what I have to do. We\u2019re Targaryens, and we all\nhave a destiny.\u201d</p><p>Aegon continued to stare at her as she was lost in deep\nthought, her brows furrowed and her fingers picking at the ends of her\nnightgown. Finally, she sighed and reached for her candle, \u201cI must go, before I\nget into trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jon sighed, heavily as he watched her carefully jump\nfrom the bed and tiptoe towards the door, \u201cDaenerys?\u201d</p><p>She turned, the candlelight reflecting her eyes like a pair\nof deep amethyst jewels, \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure if he should ask it. And he wasn\u2019t sure if\nshe would even tell him the truth if he had, but he wanted to. He wanted to so\nbadly to know if she felt the same way about him, the way he did about her. </p><p>Instead, he exhaled, defeated as he simply said,\n\u201cGoodnight.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, kindly and warmly at him, \u201cGoodnight, Prince\nAegon.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><hr><p>It was late, very late into the night when Aegon heard\nfootsteps and the silent creaking of his door being pushed open. The room was\ndark, but in the darkness, he could feel the shadows moving across his bedroom\nfloor. </p><p>His father always warned him to be prepared, because no one\nis ever safe, not even in their sleep. He reached for the dagger underneath his\npillow, ready to fight whomever dared to enter the Prince\u2019s bedroom. </p><p>He could hear breathing, heavy breathing, as though someone was\ncarrying a large weight over his shoulders. He heard a flint being struck, and\nas the light of the candle went aflame, he grasped his dagger and immediately\nswung into the air in front of him, missing the man\u2019s tunic by a mere inch. </p><p>\u201cIs that how you greet the men who are trying to save your\nlife?\u201d</p><p>Aegon\u2019s brows furrowed. He recognized that voice, \u201cLord\nVarys? What are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you have questions, my young prince, but time is of\nthe essence and unfortunately, I don\u2019t have time to answer all of them,\u201d the bald\nman said as he nodded to the men on the other side of the bed, who tossed a\nbody on the bed beside him.</p><p>Aegon jumped in surprise, watching as they unwrapped the\nbody from the cloaks. The boy, whom no doubt was dead, bared a striking\nresemblance to him. His hair was dark, curly. His skin was the same ivory tone\nas his own, \u201cWhat\u2014what is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re saving your life, Your Grace. We need to get you out\nof King\u2019s Landing, immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father is dead, if he hasn\u2019t been murdered in his sleep\nhe will be soon. And you along with him,\u201d Varys said as he watched the men\nprepare the boy in the bed, laying him there, watching as the blood in his body\nnow seeped into his clean sheets.</p><p>\u201cMy\u2014my father? We need to do something! We need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am doing the only thing I can do; I can\u2019t save him, but I\ncan save you. You can come with me now, or you can stay here and die.\u201d</p><p>Aegon glanced down at the body beside him.</p><p>This could be you.</p><p>Everything inside of him told him to stand and fight. To go\nand protect his father, to live up to his name. But he was good with a sword,\nthat didn\u2019t mean he was the best swordsman alive. He would be cut to pieces if\nhe dared to take on the phantom enemies in the castle. </p><p>There was a part of him that didn\u2019t believe the spider, but\nthere was also something like concern in the spymaster\u2019s face. He had never\nseen him look so concerned.</p><p>Reluctantly, Aegon pushed the blankets off him and pulled\nthe cloak that Lord Varys handed to him over his shoulders, bringing the hood\ndown over his face until Varys was satisfied that he would not easily be\nidentified. </p><p>He followed Lord Varys and the gang of men out of his\nchambers, the castle was silent as they proceeded in the darkness, occasionally\npausing as they heard footsteps in the halls and hiding in a dark corner until\nit was safe to pass. </p><p>He was led down parts of the castle he didn\u2019t know existed,\nplunging down further and further into the darkness until they eventually\nemerged into a small channel with a small rowboat bobbing in the water quietly,\n\u201cThis is where I leave you, Prince Aegon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will be safe with these men, they will take you somewhere\nfar away, somewhere safe. There, you will learn the truth of what has happened\ntonight,\u201d he said, \u201cOne day, you will return. But for now, stay hidden. Don\u2019t\nspeak to anyone about who you are, your life depends on it.\u201d</p><p>Aegon swallowed hard and nodded in agreement. Lord Varys\nsmiled, and bowed to him as the men pushed the rowboat away from the rocks and\ninto the calm water, \u201cUntil the day we meet again.\u201d</p><p>He watched with confused eyes as the men rowed him further\nand further out into the sea, the moonlight gleaming down on them, bathing them\nin a silver glow. The further they rowed out, the cleared the Red Keep became,\nand it was when he heard the bells begin to toll, that he knew Lord Varys spoke\nthe truth about his father.</p><p>But\u2026 why? </p><p>Who would want to kill Rhaegar Targaryen?</p><p>What about his brother? His sister? <i>Daenerys?</i></p><p>\u201cWait, we need to go back,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t do that little lad,\u201d one of the rowers said, \u201cOrders\nwere to get you out, only you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe <i>need</i> to! I\nleft someone behind\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we go back, you\u2019ll die\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care! I need to go back for her! I need to <i>protect</i> her!\u201d</p><p>Aegon began thrashing in the rowboat, readying himself to\njump out and swim back to the red keep for her. But the strong arms around him\nkept him from doing so. He shouted, screamed, and begged for them to return,\nbut every minute they moved further from the keep and out into the vast openness\nof the sea. </p><p>Once the Keep was nothing but a small speck in the distance,\nhe stopped fighting and resigned himself to his tears, thinking of those violet\neyes, and the silver hair he would never see again. Thinking of the puffy pink\nlips he would never kiss.</p><p>The soft hands he would never feel against his skin.</p><p>Her gentle smile that always made him feel weak and tremble.\n</p><p>He thought about her; about all the times they played together,\nall the times she helped him work on his penmanship, all the times she told him\nshe wished she could sword fight, and he obliged, handing her his wooden sword\nand teaching her the ways of swordsmanship. </p><p>He was vaguely aware of being pushed up the ladder of the\nside of ship, he didn\u2019t pay any mind to the sails, or the colors of the sails.\nAll he could think of was his father, and her. </p><p>The Keep was not visible from where he was now, all he saw was\nthe moonlight reflecting the surface of the water in a silver light, like the\ncolor of her hair. </p><p>His breathing was heavy as he lowered his hood and stared up\nat the moon, making a silent promise not only to himself, but to his father,\nand to her.</p><p><i>If you\u2019re alive, I\u2019ll come\nback for you.</i></p><p>It was all he could do as he sailed out in the unknown, in\nthe middle of the night.</p>",

The thunderous claps of the\nsky filled the ears of the people in the city, along with Rheagar\u2019s who watched\nas his little sister was born; a silver haired beauty with puffy pink lips,\nswollen from the journey she made into the world.<br></p><p>He watched as his mother lay in the birthing bed, unmoving\nand stiff. The color from her rose kissed cheeks was dulling to a pale white as\nblood soaked into the fine sheets that would take the servants weeks to wash\nout. He would have to burn them, he didn\u2019t want them around. He didn\u2019t want to\nremember how he lost his mother. </p><p>The gods, if there were any, were cruel to take his mother\nfrom him in the same fashion that they took his beloved, Lyanna. </p><p>He recalled that night all too well. The way she whimpered quietly\nas she pleaded with Rhaegar to take care of her child. How she cried softly at\nthe sight of the raven-haired boy gently nestled in Rheagar\u2019s strong arms. And\nthen the quiet intake of her last breath as the Stranger took her. </p><p>In the empty halls of the Red Keep, the wind whistled, and\nthe rain pattered against the hard stone, he could vaguely hear the whisper of\nher voice once more. Of his Lyanna, his winter rose. </p><p>The whispers were drowned out by the sounds of his father\u2019s\nshouting coming from his own room, \u201cBurn them all!\u201d</p><p>He sighed heavily as he held his little sister in his hands,\nhis mind feeling as though it would sooner fall out of its place in his skull\nthe longer, he heard the shouts. He wondered if he could quell the unrest that\nwas stirring within the kingdoms.</p><p>It was no secret that King Aerys was\u2026 unruly. Even he was\nfilled with unease whenever the thought that his father might become more\nunhinged plagued him. </p><p>In the darkness, in his own quarters that he shared with\nLyanna, he knew his own son, Aegon, slept soundly. </p><p>So close in age. </p><p>One of fire, and one of ice. </p><p>He took after his mother, with the dark hair and the dark\neyes. He was a northerner. A true northerner. If there was a splash of his own\nTargaryen blood within his own child, it would be in his character. It would be\nin how he chose to lead. </p><p>He had to do something. Not just for his sister, or his son,\nbut for the people of Westeros. He had to take the throne from his father and\nrule, as much as he dreaded it. As much as he\u2019d rather lay in the ground with\nhis beloved Lyanna, he had to fulfill his destiny. As did his sister. His\nbrother. And his son.</p><p>\u201cBurn them all!\u201d</p><p>The words made him cringe inside, and cool chill traveled up\nhis spine as he slowly closed his eyes, sighing heavily with sorrow. </p><p>Gently, he handed his baby sister, Daenerys, to the wet\nnurse that watched him with sad eyes, \u201cSee to it that she\u2019s well taken care of.\nI will be back for her in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Your Grace,\u201d the older lady squeaked as she took\nthe child from him. </p><p>Like the proud prince that he was, his head held high and\nthe Targaryen blood of the dragon flowing though him, he glided his way to his\nfather\u2019s quarters, his resolve stiff and true.</p><p>He had to do the right thing.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p><b>Aegon Targaryen</b></p><p>A boy of ten with a full head of curls and deep brown eyes\nwatched the young girl with flowing silver hair from the other end of the table\nas she practiced her penmanship. She sat beside his brother, Egg, and his\nsister Rhaenys. But his attention wasn\u2019t on them, it was on her; he watched as\nher delicate hand curved the letters on the parchment, glistening with ink in\nthe bright sunlight that shone through the open courtyard as Grand Maester\nPycelle droned on about the lineage and ancestry of the Targaryens, and their\ndominion over Westeros.</p><p>It was a story he\u2019d heard many times before, he could recite\nthe stories in his head word for word the way Grand Maester Pycelle spoke them,\nin his old, exhausted, heavy voice. </p><p>The Grand Maester\u2019s words were echoes in his ears, his eyes\nfocused on the girl as she listened intently to what the old man said, although\nshe had heard them many times before. She remained patient, in awe, as if all\nof this was the first time, she had heard it spoken. She loved the stories, he\nrecalled. She had told him as such. She had always dreamed of having her own\ndragons to ride, of course, that would be impossible. </p><p>All the dragons were dead. </p><p>\u201cI, I must say it is time for a spot of lunch,\u201d Pycelle\ndroned, bringing Jon out of his thought process, aware that Daenerys\u2019 eyes\nimmediately shot up to meet his. His eyes darted to the stones on the ground,\nwatching the toes of his fine leather boots with too much concentration.</p><p>He could feel her watching him with those kind violet eyes\nof hers. From the corner of his eye, he could see the gentlest of smiles begin\nto cross her puffy, pink lips.</p><p>\u201cEgg Jon!\u201d</p><p>His head immediately shot up to glance at Viserys Targaryen\ngallanting towards him, wooden swords clutched in each hand. He stared at the\nboy, almost with envy. Viserys was his uncle, and though the silver haired boy\nwas 5 years older than he, and they were rivaled in the art of swordsmanship,\neveryone secretly agreed that Aegon was better.</p><p>But he had the regal Targaryen look that his father had;\nviolet eyes, silver hair. They were beautiful, there was no denying that. And\nViserys made sure to remind him that he was an outsider. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a true Targaryen, look at you, you don\u2019t even\nhave the looks of a king,\u201d he would say as he puffed his chest out and adjusted\nhis silks and leather, \u201cNot like me.\u201d</p><p>Aegon turned and glanced down at the drying ink on parchment\nas he worked on his penmanship, \u201cWhat do you want Viserys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s spar,\u201d he said, tapping him on the back with a wooden\nsword, \u201cC\u2019mon, I\u2019ve been practicing, and I need someone to knock into the\ndirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m busy,\u201d Aegon sighed, writing his name on the parchment.\n</p><p><i>Aegon Targaryen. </i></p><p><i>Why did father name\nhim and his half-brother the same name? </i></p><p>He couldn\u2019t figure it out, and his father refused to talk\nabout it. Nevertheless, Viserys was the first person to begin calling him Jon,\nit began as a simple mispronunciation, though he would never admit it. </p><p><i>Eh-Jon</i> was how he\npronounced it, not <i>Egg-On</i>.</p><p>Since then, the name stuck. But he knew better, as time went\non, Viserys meant it more as an insult. </p><p>Viserys glanced down at the markings on the parchment, \u201cJust\nlike your footwork, your linework is awful. I suppose that\u2019s what happens when\na Targaryen tumbles with a northerner. I heard they\u2019re all savages\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut your mouth, Viserys.\u201d</p><p>The room went silent. Daenerys, who was sitting across the\ntable from him stared up at the boys with wide, worried eyes. Rhaenys and his brother,\nEgg, tensed, and slowly readied themselves for a fight; Aegon wasn\u2019t the only\none that was a victim of Viserys\u2019 constant bullying. Grand Maester Pycelle\nbreathed heavily as he began, \u201cN-now children\u2014\u201d</p><p>A sudden sting shot up from his hand to his arm as the\nwooden sword came down on him, hard. Jon shouted in agony, and in an instant,\nViserys was on the ground as Jon\u2019s fist connected with his stupid, kingly face.\n</p><p><i>Stupid boy.</i></p><p><i>Stupid silver haired\nboy.</i></p><p><i>Stupid Targaryens.</i></p><p>Viserys shouted, bringing up the wooden sword and hitting\nhim across the face with it, but Jon continued pummeling his fist into the\nsilver haired boy\u2019s face until he felt strong hands beneath him, he kicked and\nthrashed in the arms of the man who carried him, fighting to be set free\nto \u00a0beat the smug Viserys within an inch\nof his life. </p><p>Amidst the chaos and the shouting, he lost interest in\nViserys Targaryen. His own eyes fell on another pair of violet eyes, eyes that\nglanced at him with sorrow and remorse as she kneeled beside her brother,\nbrushing his hair back in her hands.</p><p><br></p><hr><p>\u201cA prince does not behave in such a manner,\u201d his father\nlectured. </p><p>Once King Rhaegar Targaryen heard of the altercation, Aegon\nknew he would be in trouble. His father consistently reminded him and\nreprimanded him when he behaved as anything other than the Prince he was, and\nthe King he was going to become.</p><p>\u201cHe said my mother was a savage,\u201d Aegon pouted, kicking the\nwooden beam of his four-poster canopy bed, \u201cI should have cut his tongue out\nlike Ser Illyn\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Aegon!\u201d</p><p>Jon paused in his steps, jumping up slightly from the sound\nof his father\u2019s raised voice. Rhaegar Targaryen very rarely raised his voice at\nhim, so he knew now that he had crossed a line. </p><p>\u201cForgive me, father, I was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to forgive, child,\u201d his father said,\nbeckoning him to take a seat beside him on the soft, feather bed. Aegon slowly\ndragged his feet towards the bed, jumping up beside his father as he placed a\nstrong arm around his small shoulders, \u201cViserys is your uncle, and as wrong as\nit was for him to say what he said, that does not warrant a reaction from you.\nIf you are to be a King one day, you need to learn to take what others have to\nsay about you in stride, you are above words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said I wasn\u2019t a real Targaryen, because I don\u2019t look\nlike you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d his father ordered. Hesitantly, Aegon looked\nup into his father\u2019s vibrant violet eyes, \u201cYou are a Targaryen. You have the\nblood of the dragon, but you\u2019re also a wolf, just as your mother was. That does\nnot change the fact that you will rule, and with ruling comes being wise to\nchoose your battles, and strong enough to avoid the words that others have to\nsay about you. You will marry Rhaenys, and together you will continue to build\nthe Targaryen dynasty.\u201d</p><p>Aegon\u2019s brows furrowed at the words, \u201c<i>Rhaenys</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you not pleased?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2014 I just\u2014 why Rhaenys?\u201d</p><p>His father\u2019s silver brows crinkled at his question, \u201cThe\nTargaryens have always wed members of their families\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you married my mother. And before that, Lady Elia. They\nweren\u2019t members of your family,\u201d Aegon pointed. </p><p>He could see the unrest in his father as he rubbed his face\nwith his hand, smirking to himself in amusement, \u201cIs this about Daenerys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? NO!\u201d Jon shouted in embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re upset that Viserys is to marry her, I know\nthat\u2019s the reason why you\u2019re not too fond of him and why you fight him every\nopportunity you get,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe that as it may, Daenerys is to wed Viserys when they\ncome of age, and you will wed Rhaenys. She is of Dornish descent, and they did\nnot take too kindly the fact that I annulled my marriage to Lady Elia. You must\nfix the mess I created with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it a mistake then, marrying my mother and having me?\u201d</p><p>Aegon felt his father\u2019s strong arms tighten around him, \u201cYou\nand your mother were never, and will never be mistakes.\u201d</p><p>Aegon looked down at his feet, nodding. He wasn\u2019t sure if he\nfelt better, or worse. </p><p>\u201cNo more fighting with Viserys, promise me,\u201d his father\nordered.</p><p>Sighing, Aegon reluctantly nodded, \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, and I will make certain he puts an end to his vile behavior\nas well. In the meantime, you are confined to your quarters to think about what\nwe\u2019ve talked about and you\u2019ve done. I\u2019ll have the servants bring your supper.\u201d</p><p>For hours after, the young boy stared up at the canopy of\nhis bed, bored and frustrated with being locked in his room. The food that the\nservants brought him remained untouched on the table across his bed. </p><p>The sound of the gentle rapping coming from his door nudged\nhim from his thoughtful stupor; his brows knitted in confusion when he saw her\ntiny figure emerge, a candle in her hand as she made her way towards his bed.\nHe sat up, staring at the little girl with wide eyes, \u201cDaenerys? What are you\ndoing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see how you were doing,\u201d she whispered, bringing\nthe candlelight to his face, observing the small marks that Viserys left on\nhim, \u201cYou\u2019re doing a lot better than Viserys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you here to tell me I shouldn\u2019t have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to tell you anything, other than sorry for\nwhat he said,\u201d she gently said.</p><p>Aegon\u2019s eyes narrowed in confusion, \u201cWhy are you sorry? It\u2019s\nnot <i>your </i>fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s jealous of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat still doesn\u2019t have anything to do with <i>you</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows you like me, Aegon,\u201d she spoke, making the boy\nflinch at her boldness.</p><p>He swallowed hard as he stared at her, his voice a slight\nwhisper as he replied, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t give him a reason to be jealous.\u201d</p><p>She smiled softly, placing the candle holder on the table\nnext to the bed and crossing her legs as she leaned in, whispering a secret,\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be the King of the Seven Kingdoms, of all of Westeros, and\nhe\u2019s not. He thinks he deserves it more than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be.\u201d</p><p>Aegon\u2019s deep brown eyes bore into the light, violet crystals\nthat were Daenerys\u2019s eyes. How could he not like her?</p><p>She was always beautiful, and kind. And bold. She was the\nonly one who didn\u2019t treat him as an outsider; even Rhaenys and Egg treated him\nlike an outsider. </p><p>But not her.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all have to do things we don\u2019t want to, Aegon.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flew back up to hers, \u201cLike marry Viserys?\u201d</p><p>He watched her tense at his name, and Aegon narrowed his\neyes suspiciously, \u201cI\u2019ll do what I have to do. We\u2019re Targaryens, and we all\nhave a destiny.\u201d</p><p>Aegon continued to stare at her as she was lost in deep\nthought, her brows furrowed and her fingers picking at the ends of her\nnightgown. Finally, she sighed and reached for her candle, \u201cI must go, before I\nget into trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jon sighed, heavily as he watched her carefully jump\nfrom the bed and tiptoe towards the door, \u201cDaenerys?\u201d</p><p>She turned, the candlelight reflecting her eyes like a pair\nof deep amethyst jewels, \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure if he should ask it. And he wasn\u2019t sure if\nshe would even tell him the truth if he had, but he wanted to. He wanted to so\nbadly to know if she felt the same way about him, the way he did about her. </p><p>Instead, he exhaled, defeated as he simply said,\n\u201cGoodnight.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, kindly and warmly at him, \u201cGoodnight, Prince\nAegon.\u201d</p><p><br></p><hr><p>It was late, very late into the night when Aegon heard\nfootsteps and the silent creaking of his door being pushed open. The room was\ndark, but in the darkness, he could feel the shadows moving across his bedroom\nfloor. </p><p>His father always warned him to be prepared, because no one\nis ever safe, not even in their sleep. He reached for the dagger underneath his\npillow, ready to fight whomever dared to enter the Prince\u2019s bedroom. </p><p>He could hear breathing, heavy breathing, as though someone was\ncarrying a large weight over his shoulders. He heard a flint being struck, and\nas the light of the candle went aflame, he grasped his dagger and immediately\nswung into the air in front of him, missing the man\u2019s tunic by a mere inch. </p><p>\u201cIs that how you greet the men who are trying to save your\nlife?\u201d</p><p>Aegon\u2019s brows furrowed. He recognized that voice, \u201cLord\nVarys? What are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you have questions, my young prince, but time is of\nthe essence and unfortunately, I don\u2019t have time to answer all of them,\u201d the bald\nman said as he nodded to the men on the other side of the bed, who tossed a\nbody on the bed beside him.</p><p>Aegon jumped in surprise, watching as they unwrapped the\nbody from the cloaks. The boy, whom no doubt was dead, bared a striking\nresemblance to him. His hair was dark, curly. His skin was the same ivory tone\nas his own, \u201cWhat\u2014what is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re saving your life, Your Grace. We need to get you out\nof King\u2019s Landing, immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father is dead, if he hasn\u2019t been murdered in his sleep\nhe will be soon. And you along with him,\u201d Varys said as he watched the men\nprepare the boy in the bed, laying him there, watching as the blood in his body\nnow seeped into his clean sheets.</p><p>\u201cMy\u2014my father? We need to do something! We need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am doing the only thing I can do; I can\u2019t save him, but I\ncan save you. You can come with me now, or you can stay here and die.\u201d</p><p>Aegon glanced down at the body beside him.</p><p>This could be you.</p><p>Everything inside of him told him to stand and fight. To go\nand protect his father, to live up to his name. But he was good with a sword,\nthat didn\u2019t mean he was the best swordsman alive. He would be cut to pieces if\nhe dared to take on the phantom enemies in the castle. </p><p>There was a part of him that didn\u2019t believe the spider, but\nthere was also something like concern in the spymaster\u2019s face. He had never\nseen him look so concerned.</p><p>Reluctantly, Aegon pushed the blankets off him and pulled\nthe cloak that Lord Varys handed to him over his shoulders, bringing the hood\ndown over his face until Varys was satisfied that he would not easily be\nidentified. </p><p>He followed Lord Varys and the gang of men out of his\nchambers, the castle was silent as they proceeded in the darkness, occasionally\npausing as they heard footsteps in the halls and hiding in a dark corner until\nit was safe to pass. </p><p>He was led down parts of the castle he didn\u2019t know existed,\nplunging down further and further into the darkness until they eventually\nemerged into a small channel with a small rowboat bobbing in the water quietly,\n\u201cThis is where I leave you, Prince Aegon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will be safe with these men, they will take you somewhere\nfar away, somewhere safe. There, you will learn the truth of what has happened\ntonight,\u201d he said, \u201cOne day, you will return. But for now, stay hidden. Don\u2019t\nspeak to anyone about who you are, your life depends on it.\u201d</p><p>Aegon swallowed hard and nodded in agreement. Lord Varys\nsmiled, and bowed to him as the men pushed the rowboat away from the rocks and\ninto the calm water, \u201cUntil the day we meet again.\u201d</p><p>He watched with confused eyes as the men rowed him further\nand further out into the sea, the moonlight gleaming down on them, bathing them\nin a silver glow. The further they rowed out, the cleared the Red Keep became,\nand it was when he heard the bells begin to toll, that he knew Lord Varys spoke\nthe truth about his father.</p><p>But\u2026 why? </p><p>Who would want to kill Rhaegar Targaryen?</p><p>What about his brother? His sister? <i>Daenerys?</i></p><p>\u201cWait, we need to go back,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t do that little lad,\u201d one of the rowers said, \u201cOrders\nwere to get you out, only you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe <i>need</i> to! I\nleft someone behind\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we go back, you\u2019ll die\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care! I need to go back for her! I need to <i>protect</i> her!\u201d</p><p>Aegon began thrashing in the rowboat, readying himself to\njump out and swim back to the red keep for her. But the strong arms around him\nkept him from doing so. He shouted, screamed, and begged for them to return,\nbut every minute they moved further from the keep and out into the vast openness\nof the sea. </p><p>Once the Keep was nothing but a small speck in the distance,\nhe stopped fighting and resigned himself to his tears, thinking of those violet\neyes, and the silver hair he would never see again. Thinking of the puffy pink\nlips he would never kiss.</p><p>The soft hands he would never feel against his skin.</p><p>Her gentle smile that always made him feel weak and tremble.\n</p><p>He thought about her; about all the times they played together,\nall the times she helped him work on his penmanship, all the times she told him\nshe wished she could sword fight, and he obliged, handing her his wooden sword\nand teaching her the ways of swordsmanship. </p><p>He was vaguely aware of being pushed up the ladder of the\nside of ship, he didn\u2019t pay any mind to the sails, or the colors of the sails.\nAll he could think of was his father, and her. </p><p>The Keep was not visible from where he was now, all he saw was\nthe moonlight reflecting the surface of the water in a silver light, like the\ncolor of her hair. </p><p>His breathing was heavy as he lowered his hood and stared up\nat the moon, making a silent promise not only to himself, but to his father,\nand to her.</p><p><i>If you\u2019re alive, I\u2019ll come\nback for you.</i></p><p>It was all he could do as he sailed out in the unknown, in\nthe middle of the night.</p></p>",

The thunderous claps of the\nsky filled the ears of the people in the city, along with Rheagar\u2019s who watched\nas his little sister was born; a silver haired beauty with puffy pink lips,\nswollen from the journey she made into the world.<br></p><p>He watched as his mother lay in the birthing bed, unmoving\nand stiff. The color from her rose kissed cheeks was dulling to a pale white as\nblood soaked into the fine sheets that would take the servants weeks to wash\nout. He would have to burn them, he didn\u2019t want them around. He didn\u2019t want to\nremember how he lost his mother. </p><p>The gods, if there were any, were cruel to take his mother\nfrom him in the same fashion that they took his beloved, Lyanna. </p><p>He recalled that night all too well. The way she whimpered quietly\nas she pleaded with Rhaegar to take care of her child. How she cried softly at\nthe sight of the raven-haired boy gently nestled in Rheagar\u2019s strong arms. And\nthen the quiet intake of her last breath as the Stranger took her. </p><p>In the empty halls of the Red Keep, the wind whistled, and\nthe rain pattered against the hard stone, he could vaguely hear the whisper of\nher voice once more. Of his Lyanna, his winter rose. </p><p>The whispers were drowned out by the sounds of his father\u2019s\nshouting coming from his own room, \u201cBurn them all!\u201d</p><p>He sighed heavily as he held his little sister in his hands,\nhis mind feeling as though it would sooner fall out of its place in his skull\nthe longer, he heard the shouts. He wondered if he could quell the unrest that\nwas stirring within the kingdoms.</p><p>It was no secret that King Aerys was\u2026 unruly. Even he was\nfilled with unease whenever the thought that his father might become more\nunhinged plagued him. </p><p>In the darkness, in his own quarters that he shared with\nLyanna, he knew his own son, Aegon, slept soundly. </p><p>So close in age. </p><p>One of fire, and one of ice. </p><p>He took after his mother, with the dark hair and the dark\neyes. He was a northerner. A true northerner. If there was a splash of his own\nTargaryen blood within his own child, it would be in his character. It would be\nin how he chose to lead. </p><p>He had to do something. Not just for his sister, or his son,\nbut for the people of Westeros. He had to take the throne from his father and\nrule, as much as he dreaded it. As much as he\u2019d rather lay in the ground with\nhis beloved Lyanna, he had to fulfill his destiny. As did his sister. His\nbrother. And his son.</p><p>\u201cBurn them all!\u201d</p><p>The words made him cringe inside, and cool chill traveled up\nhis spine as he slowly closed his eyes, sighing heavily with sorrow. </p><p>Gently, he handed his baby sister, Daenerys, to the wet\nnurse that watched him with sad eyes, \u201cSee to it that she\u2019s well taken care of.\nI will be back for her in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Your Grace,\u201d the older lady squeaked as she took\nthe child from him. </p><p>Like the proud prince that he was, his head held high and\nthe Targaryen blood of the dragon flowing though him, he glided his way to his\nfather\u2019s quarters, his resolve stiff and true.</p><p>He had to do the right thing.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p><b>Aegon Targaryen</b></p><p>A boy of ten with a full head of curls and deep brown eyes\nwatched the young girl with flowing silver hair from the other end of the table\nas she practiced her penmanship. She sat beside his brother, Egg, and his\nsister Rhaenys. But his attention wasn\u2019t on them, it was on her; he watched as\nher delicate hand curved the letters on the parchment, glistening with ink in\nthe bright sunlight that shone through the open courtyard as Grand Maester\nPycelle droned on about the lineage and ancestry of the Targaryens, and their\ndominion over Westeros.</p><p>It was a story he\u2019d heard many times before, he could recite\nthe stories in his head word for word the way Grand Maester Pycelle spoke them,\nin his old, exhausted, heavy voice. </p><p>The Grand Maester\u2019s words were echoes in his ears, his eyes\nfocused on the girl as she listened intently to what the old man said, although\nshe had heard them many times before. She remained patient, in awe, as if all\nof this was the first time, she had heard it spoken. She loved the stories, he\nrecalled. She had told him as such. She had always dreamed of having her own\ndragons to ride, of course, that would be impossible. </p><p>All the dragons were dead. </p><p>\u201cI, I must say it is time for a spot of lunch,\u201d Pycelle\ndroned, bringing Jon out of his thought process, aware that Daenerys\u2019 eyes\nimmediately shot up to meet his. His eyes darted to the stones on the ground,\nwatching the toes of his fine leather boots with too much concentration.</p><p>He could feel her watching him with those kind violet eyes\nof hers. From the corner of his eye, he could see the gentlest of smiles begin\nto cross her puffy, pink lips.</p><p>\u201cEgg Jon!\u201d</p><p>His head immediately shot up to glance at Viserys Targaryen\ngallanting towards him, wooden swords clutched in each hand. He stared at the\nboy, almost with envy. Viserys was his uncle, and though the silver haired boy\nwas 5 years older than he, and they were rivaled in the art of swordsmanship,\neveryone secretly agreed that Aegon was better.</p><p>But he had the regal Targaryen look that his father had;\nviolet eyes, silver hair. They were beautiful, there was no denying that. And\nViserys made sure to remind him that he was an outsider. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a true Targaryen, look at you, you don\u2019t even\nhave the looks of a king,\u201d he would say as he puffed his chest out and adjusted\nhis silks and leather, \u201cNot like me.\u201d</p><p>Aegon turned and glanced down at the drying ink on parchment\nas he worked on his penmanship, \u201cWhat do you want Viserys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s spar,\u201d he said, tapping him on the back with a wooden\nsword, \u201cC\u2019mon, I\u2019ve been practicing, and I need someone to knock into the\ndirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m busy,\u201d Aegon sighed, writing his name on the parchment.\n</p><p><i>Aegon Targaryen. </i></p><p><i>Why did father name\nhim and his half-brother the same name? </i></p><p>He couldn\u2019t figure it out, and his father refused to talk\nabout it. Nevertheless, Viserys was the first person to begin calling him Jon,\nit began as a simple mispronunciation, though he would never admit it. </p><p><i>Eh-Jon</i> was how he\npronounced it, not <i>Egg-On</i>.</p><p>Since then, the name stuck. But he knew better, as time went\non, Viserys meant it more as an insult. </p><p>Viserys glanced down at the markings on the parchment, \u201cJust\nlike your footwork, your linework is awful. I suppose that\u2019s what happens when\na Targaryen tumbles with a northerner. I heard they\u2019re all savages\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut your mouth, Viserys.\u201d</p><p>The room went silent. Daenerys, who was sitting across the\ntable from him stared up at the boys with wide, worried eyes. Rhaenys and his brother,\nEgg, tensed, and slowly readied themselves for a fight; Aegon wasn\u2019t the only\none that was a victim of Viserys\u2019 constant bullying. Grand Maester Pycelle\nbreathed heavily as he began, \u201cN-now children\u2014\u201d</p><p>A sudden sting shot up from his hand to his arm as the\nwooden sword came down on him, hard. Jon shouted in agony, and in an instant,\nViserys was on the ground as Jon\u2019s fist connected with his stupid, kingly face.\n</p><p><i>Stupid boy.</i></p><p><i>Stupid silver haired\nboy.</i></p><p><i>Stupid Targaryens.</i></p><p>Viserys shouted, bringing up the wooden sword and hitting\nhim across the face with it, but Jon continued pummeling his fist into the\nsilver haired boy\u2019s face until he felt strong hands beneath him, he kicked and\nthrashed in the arms of the man who carried him, fighting to be set free\nto \u00a0beat the smug Viserys within an inch\nof his life. </p><p>Amidst the chaos and the shouting, he lost interest in\nViserys Targaryen. His own eyes fell on another pair of violet eyes, eyes that\nglanced at him with sorrow and remorse as she kneeled beside her brother,\nbrushing his hair back in her hands.</p><p><br></p><hr><p>\u201cA prince does not behave in such a manner,\u201d his father\nlectured. </p><p>Once King Rhaegar Targaryen heard of the altercation, Aegon\nknew he would be in trouble. His father consistently reminded him and\nreprimanded him when he behaved as anything other than the Prince he was, and\nthe King he was going to become.</p><p>\u201cHe said my mother was a savage,\u201d Aegon pouted, kicking the\nwooden beam of his four-poster canopy bed, \u201cI should have cut his tongue out\nlike Ser Illyn\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Aegon!\u201d</p><p>Jon paused in his steps, jumping up slightly from the sound\nof his father\u2019s raised voice. Rhaegar Targaryen very rarely raised his voice at\nhim, so he knew now that he had crossed a line. </p><p>\u201cForgive me, father, I was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to forgive, child,\u201d his father said,\nbeckoning him to take a seat beside him on the soft, feather bed. Aegon slowly\ndragged his feet towards the bed, jumping up beside his father as he placed a\nstrong arm around his small shoulders, \u201cViserys is your uncle, and as wrong as\nit was for him to say what he said, that does not warrant a reaction from you.\nIf you are to be a King one day, you need to learn to take what others have to\nsay about you in stride, you are above words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said I wasn\u2019t a real Targaryen, because I don\u2019t look\nlike you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d his father ordered. Hesitantly, Aegon looked\nup into his father\u2019s vibrant violet eyes, \u201cYou are a Targaryen. You have the\nblood of the dragon, but you\u2019re also a wolf, just as your mother was. That does\nnot change the fact that you will rule, and with ruling comes being wise to\nchoose your battles, and strong enough to avoid the words that others have to\nsay about you. You will marry Rhaenys, and together you will continue to build\nthe Targaryen dynasty.\u201d</p><p>Aegon\u2019s brows furrowed at the words, \u201c<i>Rhaenys</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you not pleased?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2014 I just\u2014 why Rhaenys?\u201d</p><p>His father\u2019s silver brows crinkled at his question, \u201cThe\nTargaryens have always wed members of their families\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you married my mother. And before that, Lady Elia. They\nweren\u2019t members of your family,\u201d Aegon pointed. </p><p>He could see the unrest in his father as he rubbed his face\nwith his hand, smirking to himself in amusement, \u201cIs this about Daenerys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? NO!\u201d Jon shouted in embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re upset that Viserys is to marry her, I know\nthat\u2019s the reason why you\u2019re not too fond of him and why you fight him every\nopportunity you get,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe that as it may, Daenerys is to wed Viserys when they\ncome of age, and you will wed Rhaenys. She is of Dornish descent, and they did\nnot take too kindly the fact that I annulled my marriage to Lady Elia. You must\nfix the mess I created with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it a mistake then, marrying my mother and having me?\u201d</p><p>Aegon felt his father\u2019s strong arms tighten around him, \u201cYou\nand your mother were never, and will never be mistakes.\u201d</p><p>Aegon looked down at his feet, nodding. He wasn\u2019t sure if he\nfelt better, or worse. </p><p>\u201cNo more fighting with Viserys, promise me,\u201d his father\nordered.</p><p>Sighing, Aegon reluctantly nodded, \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, and I will make certain he puts an end to his vile behavior\nas well. In the meantime, you are confined to your quarters to think about what\nwe\u2019ve talked about and you\u2019ve done. I\u2019ll have the servants bring your supper.\u201d</p><p>For hours after, the young boy stared up at the canopy of\nhis bed, bored and frustrated with being locked in his room. The food that the\nservants brought him remained untouched on the table across his bed. </p><p>The sound of the gentle rapping coming from his door nudged\nhim from his thoughtful stupor; his brows knitted in confusion when he saw her\ntiny figure emerge, a candle in her hand as she made her way towards his bed.\nHe sat up, staring at the little girl with wide eyes, \u201cDaenerys? What are you\ndoing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see how you were doing,\u201d she whispered, bringing\nthe candlelight to his face, observing the small marks that Viserys left on\nhim, \u201cYou\u2019re doing a lot better than Viserys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you here to tell me I shouldn\u2019t have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to tell you anything, other than sorry for\nwhat he said,\u201d she gently said.</p><p>Aegon\u2019s eyes narrowed in confusion, \u201cWhy are you sorry? It\u2019s\nnot <i>your </i>fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s jealous of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat still doesn\u2019t have anything to do with <i>you</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows you like me, Aegon,\u201d she spoke, making the boy\nflinch at her boldness.</p><p>He swallowed hard as he stared at her, his voice a slight\nwhisper as he replied, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t give him a reason to be jealous.\u201d</p><p>She smiled softly, placing the candle holder on the table\nnext to the bed and crossing her legs as she leaned in, whispering a secret,\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be the King of the Seven Kingdoms, of all of Westeros, and\nhe\u2019s not. He thinks he deserves it more than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be.\u201d</p><p>Aegon\u2019s deep brown eyes bore into the light, violet crystals\nthat were Daenerys\u2019s eyes. How could he not like her?</p><p>She was always beautiful, and kind. And bold. She was the\nonly one who didn\u2019t treat him as an outsider; even Rhaenys and Egg treated him\nlike an outsider. </p><p>But not her.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all have to do things we don\u2019t want to, Aegon.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flew back up to hers, \u201cLike marry Viserys?\u201d</p><p>He watched her tense at his name, and Aegon narrowed his\neyes suspiciously, \u201cI\u2019ll do what I have to do. We\u2019re Targaryens, and we all\nhave a destiny.\u201d</p><p>Aegon continued to stare at her as she was lost in deep\nthought, her brows furrowed and her fingers picking at the ends of her\nnightgown. Finally, she sighed and reached for her candle, \u201cI must go, before I\nget into trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jon sighed, heavily as he watched her carefully jump\nfrom the bed and tiptoe towards the door, \u201cDaenerys?\u201d</p><p>She turned, the candlelight reflecting her eyes like a pair\nof deep amethyst jewels, \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure if he should ask it. And he wasn\u2019t sure if\nshe would even tell him the truth if he had, but he wanted to. He wanted to so\nbadly to know if she felt the same way about him, the way he did about her. </p><p>Instead, he exhaled, defeated as he simply said,\n\u201cGoodnight.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, kindly and warmly at him, \u201cGoodnight, Prince\nAegon.\u201d</p><p><br></p><hr><p>It was late, very late into the night when Aegon heard\nfootsteps and the silent creaking of his door being pushed open. The room was\ndark, but in the darkness, he could feel the shadows moving across his bedroom\nfloor. </p><p>His father always warned him to be prepared, because no one\nis ever safe, not even in their sleep. He reached for the dagger underneath his\npillow, ready to fight whomever dared to enter the Prince\u2019s bedroom. </p><p>He could hear breathing, heavy breathing, as though someone was\ncarrying a large weight over his shoulders. He heard a flint being struck, and\nas the light of the candle went aflame, he grasped his dagger and immediately\nswung into the air in front of him, missing the man\u2019s tunic by a mere inch. </p><p>\u201cIs that how you greet the men who are trying to save your\nlife?\u201d</p><p>Aegon\u2019s brows furrowed. He recognized that voice, \u201cLord\nVarys? What are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you have questions, my young prince, but time is of\nthe essence and unfortunately, I don\u2019t have time to answer all of them,\u201d the bald\nman said as he nodded to the men on the other side of the bed, who tossed a\nbody on the bed beside him.</p><p>Aegon jumped in surprise, watching as they unwrapped the\nbody from the cloaks. The boy, whom no doubt was dead, bared a striking\nresemblance to him. His hair was dark, curly. His skin was the same ivory tone\nas his own, \u201cWhat\u2014what is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re saving your life, Your Grace. We need to get you out\nof King\u2019s Landing, immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father is dead, if he hasn\u2019t been murdered in his sleep\nhe will be soon. And you along with him,\u201d Varys said as he watched the men\nprepare the boy in the bed, laying him there, watching as the blood in his body\nnow seeped into his clean sheets.</p><p>\u201cMy\u2014my father? We need to do something! We need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am doing the only thing I can do; I can\u2019t save him, but I\ncan save you. You can come with me now, or you can stay here and die.\u201d</p><p>Aegon glanced down at the body beside him.</p><p>This could be you.</p><p>Everything inside of him told him to stand and fight. To go\nand protect his father, to live up to his name. But he was good with a sword,\nthat didn\u2019t mean he was the best swordsman alive. He would be cut to pieces if\nhe dared to take on the phantom enemies in the castle. </p><p>There was a part of him that didn\u2019t believe the spider, but\nthere was also something like concern in the spymaster\u2019s face. He had never\nseen him look so concerned.</p><p>Reluctantly, Aegon pushed the blankets off him and pulled\nthe cloak that Lord Varys handed to him over his shoulders, bringing the hood\ndown over his face until Varys was satisfied that he would not easily be\nidentified. </p><p>He followed Lord Varys and the gang of men out of his\nchambers, the castle was silent as they proceeded in the darkness, occasionally\npausing as they heard footsteps in the halls and hiding in a dark corner until\nit was safe to pass. </p><p>He was led down parts of the castle he didn\u2019t know existed,\nplunging down further and further into the darkness until they eventually\nemerged into a small channel with a small rowboat bobbing in the water quietly,\n\u201cThis is where I leave you, Prince Aegon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will be safe with these men, they will take you somewhere\nfar away, somewhere safe. There, you will learn the truth of what has happened\ntonight,\u201d he said, \u201cOne day, you will return. But for now, stay hidden. Don\u2019t\nspeak to anyone about who you are, your life depends on it.\u201d</p><p>Aegon swallowed hard and nodded in agreement. Lord Varys\nsmiled, and bowed to him as the men pushed the rowboat away from the rocks and\ninto the calm water, \u201cUntil the day we meet again.\u201d</p><p>He watched with confused eyes as the men rowed him further\nand further out into the sea, the moonlight gleaming down on them, bathing them\nin a silver glow. The further they rowed out, the cleared the Red Keep became,\nand it was when he heard the bells begin to toll, that he knew Lord Varys spoke\nthe truth about his father.</p><p>But\u2026 why? </p><p>Who would want to kill Rhaegar Targaryen?</p><p>What about his brother? His sister? <i>Daenerys?</i></p><p>\u201cWait, we need to go back,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t do that little lad,\u201d one of the rowers said, \u201cOrders\nwere to get you out, only you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe <i>need</i> to! I\nleft someone behind\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we go back, you\u2019ll die\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care! I need to go back for her! I need to <i>protect</i> her!\u201d</p><p>Aegon began thrashing in the rowboat, readying himself to\njump out and swim back to the red keep for her. But the strong arms around him\nkept him from doing so. He shouted, screamed, and begged for them to return,\nbut every minute they moved further from the keep and out into the vast openness\nof the sea. </p><p>Once the Keep was nothing but a small speck in the distance,\nhe stopped fighting and resigned himself to his tears, thinking of those violet\neyes, and the silver hair he would never see again. Thinking of the puffy pink\nlips he would never kiss.</p><p>The soft hands he would never feel against his skin.</p><p>Her gentle smile that always made him feel weak and tremble.\n</p><p>He thought about her; about all the times they played together,\nall the times she helped him work on his penmanship, all the times she told him\nshe wished she could sword fight, and he obliged, handing her his wooden sword\nand teaching her the ways of swordsmanship. </p><p>He was vaguely aware of being pushed up the ladder of the\nside of ship, he didn\u2019t pay any mind to the sails, or the colors of the sails.\nAll he could think of was his father, and her. </p><p>The Keep was not visible from where he was now, all he saw was\nthe moonlight reflecting the surface of the water in a silver light, like the\ncolor of her hair. </p><p>His breathing was heavy as he lowered his hood and stared up\nat the moon, making a silent promise not only to himself, but to his father,\nand to her.</p><p><i>If you\u2019re alive, I\u2019ll come\nback for you.</i></p><p>It was all he could do as he sailed out in the unknown, in\nthe middle of the night.</p></p>",

The thunderous claps of the\nsky filled the ears of the people in the city, along with Rheagar&rsquo;s who watched\nas his little sister was born; a silver haired beauty with puffy pink lips,\nswollen from the journey she made into the world.<br /></p><p>He watched as his mother lay in the birthing bed, unmoving\nand stiff. The color from her rose kissed cheeks was dulling to a pale white as\nblood soaked into the fine sheets that would take the servants weeks to wash\nout. He would have to burn them, he didn&rsquo;t want them around. He didn&rsquo;t want to\nremember how he lost his mother. </p><p>The gods, if there were any, were cruel to take his mother\nfrom him in the same fashion that they took his beloved, Lyanna. </p><p>He recalled that night all too well. The way she whimpered quietly\nas she pleaded with Rhaegar to take care of her child. How she cried softly at\nthe sight of the raven-haired boy gently nestled in Rheagar&rsquo;s strong arms. And\nthen the quiet intake of her last breath as the Stranger took her. </p><p>In the empty halls of the Red Keep, the wind whistled, and\nthe rain pattered against the hard stone, he could vaguely hear the whisper of\nher voice once more. Of his Lyanna, his winter rose. </p><p>The whispers were drowned out by the sounds of his father&rsquo;s\nshouting coming from his own room, &ldquo;Burn them all!&rdquo;</p><p>He sighed heavily as he held his little sister in his hands,\nhis mind feeling as though it would sooner fall out of its place in his skull\nthe longer, he heard the shouts. He wondered if he could quell the unrest that\nwas stirring within the kingdoms.</p><p>It was no secret that King Aerys was&hellip; unruly. Even he was\nfilled with unease whenever the thought that his father might become more\nunhinged plagued him. </p><p>In the darkness, in his own quarters that he shared with\nLyanna, he knew his own son, Aegon, slept soundly. </p><p>So close in age. </p><p>One of fire, and one of ice. </p><p>He took after his mother, with the dark hair and the dark\neyes. He was a northerner. A true northerner. If there was a splash of his own\nTargaryen blood within his own child, it would be in his character. It would be\nin how he chose to lead. </p><p>He had to do something. Not just for his sister, or his son,\nbut for the people of Westeros. He had to take the throne from his father and\nrule, as much as he dreaded it. As much as he&rsquo;d rather lay in the ground with\nhis beloved Lyanna, he had to fulfill his destiny. As did his sister. His\nbrother. And his son.</p><p>&ldquo;Burn them all!&rdquo;</p><p>The words made him cringe inside, and cool chill traveled up\nhis spine as he slowly closed his eyes, sighing heavily with sorrow. </p><p>Gently, he handed his baby sister, Daenerys, to the wet\nnurse that watched him with sad eyes, &ldquo;See to it that she&rsquo;s well taken care of.\nI will be back for her in the morning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, Your Grace,&rdquo; the older lady squeaked as she took\nthe child from him. </p><p>Like the proud prince that he was, his head held high and\nthe Targaryen blood of the dragon flowing though him, he glided his way to his\nfather&rsquo;s quarters, his resolve stiff and true.</p><p>He had to do the right thing.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p><b>Aegon Targaryen</b></p><p>A boy of ten with a full head of curls and deep brown eyes\nwatched the young girl with flowing silver hair from the other end of the table\nas she practiced her penmanship. She sat beside his brother, Egg, and his\nsister Rhaenys. But his attention wasn&rsquo;t on them, it was on her; he watched as\nher delicate hand curved the letters on the parchment, glistening with ink in\nthe bright sunlight that shone through the open courtyard as Grand Maester\nPycelle droned on about the lineage and ancestry of the Targaryens, and their\ndominion over Westeros.</p><p>It was a story he&rsquo;d heard many times before, he could recite\nthe stories in his head word for word the way Grand Maester Pycelle spoke them,\nin his old, exhausted, heavy voice. </p><p>The Grand Maester&rsquo;s words were echoes in his ears, his eyes\nfocused on the girl as she listened intently to what the old man said, although\nshe had heard them many times before. She remained patient, in awe, as if all\nof this was the first time, she had heard it spoken. She loved the stories, he\nrecalled. She had told him as such. She had always dreamed of having her own\ndragons to ride, of course, that would be impossible. </p><p>All the dragons were dead. </p><p>&ldquo;I, I must say it is time for a spot of lunch,&rdquo; Pycelle\ndroned, bringing Jon out of his thought process, aware that Daenerys&rsquo; eyes\nimmediately shot up to meet his. His eyes darted to the stones on the ground,\nwatching the toes of his fine leather boots with too much concentration.</p><p>He could feel her watching him with those kind violet eyes\nof hers. From the corner of his eye, he could see the gentlest of smiles begin\nto cross her puffy, pink lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Egg Jon!&rdquo;</p><p>His head immediately shot up to glance at Viserys Targaryen\ngallanting towards him, wooden swords clutched in each hand. He stared at the\nboy, almost with envy. Viserys was his uncle, and though the silver haired boy\nwas 5 years older than he, and they were rivaled in the art of swordsmanship,\neveryone secretly agreed that Aegon was better.</p><p>But he had the regal Targaryen look that his father had;\nviolet eyes, silver hair. They were beautiful, there was no denying that. And\nViserys made sure to remind him that he was an outsider. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a true Targaryen, look at you, you don&rsquo;t even\nhave the looks of a king,&rdquo; he would say as he puffed his chest out and adjusted\nhis silks and leather, &ldquo;Not like me.&rdquo;</p><p>Aegon turned and glanced down at the drying ink on parchment\nas he worked on his penmanship, &ldquo;What do you want Viserys?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s spar,&rdquo; he said, tapping him on the back with a wooden\nsword, &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, I&rsquo;ve been practicing, and I need someone to knock into the\ndirt.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m busy,&rdquo; Aegon sighed, writing his name on the parchment.\n</p><p><i>Aegon Targaryen. </i></p><p><i>Why did father name\nhim and his half-brother the same name? </i></p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t figure it out, and his father refused to talk\nabout it. Nevertheless, Viserys was the first person to begin calling him Jon,\nit began as a simple mispronunciation, though he would never admit it. </p><p><i>Eh-Jon</i> was how he\npronounced it, not <i>Egg-On</i>.</p><p>Since then, the name stuck. But he knew better, as time went\non, Viserys meant it more as an insult. </p><p>Viserys glanced down at the markings on the parchment, &ldquo;Just\nlike your footwork, your linework is awful. I suppose that&rsquo;s what happens when\na Targaryen tumbles with a northerner. I heard they&rsquo;re all savages&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shut your mouth, Viserys.&rdquo;</p><p>The room went silent. Daenerys, who was sitting across the\ntable from him stared up at the boys with wide, worried eyes. Rhaenys and his brother,\nEgg, tensed, and slowly readied themselves for a fight; Aegon wasn&rsquo;t the only\none that was a victim of Viserys&rsquo; constant bullying. Grand Maester Pycelle\nbreathed heavily as he began, &ldquo;N-now children&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>A sudden sting shot up from his hand to his arm as the\nwooden sword came down on him, hard. Jon shouted in agony, and in an instant,\nViserys was on the ground as Jon&rsquo;s fist connected with his stupid, kingly face.\n</p><p><i>Stupid boy.</i></p><p><i>Stupid silver haired\nboy.</i></p><p><i>Stupid Targaryens.</i></p><p>Viserys shouted, bringing up the wooden sword and hitting\nhim across the face with it, but Jon continued pummeling his fist into the\nsilver haired boy&rsquo;s face until he felt strong hands beneath him, he kicked and\nthrashed in the arms of the man who carried him, fighting to be set free\nto &nbsp;beat the smug Viserys within an inch\nof his life. </p><p>Amidst the chaos and the shouting, he lost interest in\nViserys Targaryen. His own eyes fell on another pair of violet eyes, eyes that\nglanced at him with sorrow and remorse as she kneeled beside her brother,\nbrushing his hair back in her hands.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p>&ldquo;A prince does not behave in such a manner,&rdquo; his father\nlectured. </p><p>Once King Rhaegar Targaryen heard of the altercation, Aegon\nknew he would be in trouble. His father consistently reminded him and\nreprimanded him when he behaved as anything other than the Prince he was, and\nthe King he was going to become.</p><p>&ldquo;He said my mother was a savage,&rdquo; Aegon pouted, kicking the\nwooden beam of his four-poster canopy bed, &ldquo;I should have cut his tongue out\nlike Ser Illyn&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough, Aegon!&rdquo;</p><p>Jon paused in his steps, jumping up slightly from the sound\nof his father&rsquo;s raised voice. Rhaegar Targaryen very rarely raised his voice at\nhim, so he knew now that he had crossed a line. </p><p>&ldquo;Forgive me, father, I was&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to forgive, child,&rdquo; his father said,\nbeckoning him to take a seat beside him on the soft, feather bed. Aegon slowly\ndragged his feet towards the bed, jumping up beside his father as he placed a\nstrong arm around his small shoulders, &ldquo;Viserys is your uncle, and as wrong as\nit was for him to say what he said, that does not warrant a reaction from you.\nIf you are to be a King one day, you need to learn to take what others have to\nsay about you in stride, you are above words.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He said I wasn&rsquo;t a real Targaryen, because I don&rsquo;t look\nlike you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look at me,&rdquo; his father ordered. Hesitantly, Aegon looked\nup into his father&rsquo;s vibrant violet eyes, &ldquo;You are a Targaryen. You have the\nblood of the dragon, but you&rsquo;re also a wolf, just as your mother was. That does\nnot change the fact that you will rule, and with ruling comes being wise to\nchoose your battles, and strong enough to avoid the words that others have to\nsay about you. You will marry Rhaenys, and together you will continue to build\nthe Targaryen dynasty.&rdquo;</p><p>Aegon&rsquo;s brows furrowed at the words, &ldquo;<i>Rhaenys</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you not pleased?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not&mdash; I just&mdash; why Rhaenys?&rdquo;</p><p>His father&rsquo;s silver brows crinkled at his question, &ldquo;The\nTargaryens have always wed members of their families&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you married my mother. And before that, Lady Elia. They\nweren&rsquo;t members of your family,&rdquo; Aegon pointed. </p><p>He could see the unrest in his father as he rubbed his face\nwith his hand, smirking to himself in amusement, &ldquo;Is this about Daenerys?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? NO!&rdquo; Jon shouted in embarrassment.</p><p>&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re upset that Viserys is to marry her, I know\nthat&rsquo;s the reason why you&rsquo;re not too fond of him and why you fight him every\nopportunity you get,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Be that as it may, Daenerys is to wed Viserys when they\ncome of age, and you will wed Rhaenys. She is of Dornish descent, and they did\nnot take too kindly the fact that I annulled my marriage to Lady Elia. You must\nfix the mess I created with them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Was it a mistake then, marrying my mother and having me?&rdquo;</p><p>Aegon felt his father&rsquo;s strong arms tighten around him, &ldquo;You\nand your mother were never, and will never be mistakes.&rdquo;</p><p>Aegon looked down at his feet, nodding. He wasn&rsquo;t sure if he\nfelt better, or worse. </p><p>&ldquo;No more fighting with Viserys, promise me,&rdquo; his father\nordered.</p><p>Sighing, Aegon reluctantly nodded, &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good, and I will make certain he puts an end to his vile behavior\nas well. In the meantime, you are confined to your quarters to think about what\nwe&rsquo;ve talked about and you&rsquo;ve done. I&rsquo;ll have the servants bring your supper.&rdquo;</p><p>For hours after, the young boy stared up at the canopy of\nhis bed, bored and frustrated with being locked in his room. The food that the\nservants brought him remained untouched on the table across his bed. </p><p>The sound of the gentle rapping coming from his door nudged\nhim from his thoughtful stupor; his brows knitted in confusion when he saw her\ntiny figure emerge, a candle in her hand as she made her way towards his bed.\nHe sat up, staring at the little girl with wide eyes, &ldquo;Daenerys? What are you\ndoing here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wanted to see how you were doing,&rdquo; she whispered, bringing\nthe candlelight to his face, observing the small marks that Viserys left on\nhim, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing a lot better than Viserys.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you here to tell me I shouldn&rsquo;t have&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not here to tell you anything, other than sorry for\nwhat he said,&rdquo; she gently said.</p><p>Aegon&rsquo;s eyes narrowed in confusion, &ldquo;Why are you sorry? It&rsquo;s\nnot <i>your </i>fault.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s jealous of you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That still doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with <i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He knows you like me, Aegon,&rdquo; she spoke, making the boy\nflinch at her boldness.</p><p>He swallowed hard as he stared at her, his voice a slight\nwhisper as he replied, &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t give him a reason to be jealous.&rdquo;</p><p>She smiled softly, placing the candle holder on the table\nnext to the bed and crossing her legs as she leaned in, whispering a secret,\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be the King of the Seven Kingdoms, of all of Westeros, and\nhe&rsquo;s not. He thinks he deserves it more than you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be king.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be.&rdquo;</p><p>Aegon&rsquo;s deep brown eyes bore into the light, violet crystals\nthat were Daenerys&rsquo;s eyes. How could he not like her?</p><p>She was always beautiful, and kind. And bold. She was the\nonly one who didn&rsquo;t treat him as an outsider; even Rhaenys and Egg treated him\nlike an outsider. </p><p>But not her.</p><p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We all have to do things we don&rsquo;t want to, Aegon.&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes flew back up to hers, &ldquo;Like marry Viserys?&rdquo;</p><p>He watched her tense at his name, and Aegon narrowed his\neyes suspiciously, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do what I have to do. We&rsquo;re Targaryens, and we all\nhave a destiny.&rdquo;</p><p>Aegon continued to stare at her as she was lost in deep\nthought, her brows furrowed and her fingers picking at the ends of her\nnightgown. Finally, she sighed and reached for her candle, &ldquo;I must go, before I\nget into trouble.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Jon sighed, heavily as he watched her carefully jump\nfrom the bed and tiptoe towards the door, &ldquo;Daenerys?&rdquo;</p><p>She turned, the candlelight reflecting her eyes like a pair\nof deep amethyst jewels, &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t sure if he should ask it. And he wasn&rsquo;t sure if\nshe would even tell him the truth if he had, but he wanted to. He wanted to so\nbadly to know if she felt the same way about him, the way he did about her. </p><p>Instead, he exhaled, defeated as he simply said,\n&ldquo;Goodnight.&rdquo;</p><p>She smiled, kindly and warmly at him, &ldquo;Goodnight, Prince\nAegon.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p>It was late, very late into the night when Aegon heard\nfootsteps and the silent creaking of his door being pushed open. The room was\ndark, but in the darkness, he could feel the shadows moving across his bedroom\nfloor. </p><p>His father always warned him to be prepared, because no one\nis ever safe, not even in their sleep. He reached for the dagger underneath his\npillow, ready to fight whomever dared to enter the Prince&rsquo;s bedroom. </p><p>He could hear breathing, heavy breathing, as though someone was\ncarrying a large weight over his shoulders. He heard a flint being struck, and\nas the light of the candle went aflame, he grasped his dagger and immediately\nswung into the air in front of him, missing the man&rsquo;s tunic by a mere inch. </p><p>&ldquo;Is that how you greet the men who are trying to save your\nlife?&rdquo;</p><p>Aegon&rsquo;s brows furrowed. He recognized that voice, &ldquo;Lord\nVarys? What are you&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know you have questions, my young prince, but time is of\nthe essence and unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t have time to answer all of them,&rdquo; the bald\nman said as he nodded to the men on the other side of the bed, who tossed a\nbody on the bed beside him.</p><p>Aegon jumped in surprise, watching as they unwrapped the\nbody from the cloaks. The boy, whom no doubt was dead, bared a striking\nresemblance to him. His hair was dark, curly. His skin was the same ivory tone\nas his own, &ldquo;What&mdash;what is this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re saving your life, Your Grace. We need to get you out\nof King&rsquo;s Landing, immediately.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your father is dead, if he hasn&rsquo;t been murdered in his sleep\nhe will be soon. And you along with him,&rdquo; Varys said as he watched the men\nprepare the boy in the bed, laying him there, watching as the blood in his body\nnow seeped into his clean sheets.</p><p>&ldquo;My&mdash;my father? We need to do something! We need to&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am doing the only thing I can do; I can&rsquo;t save him, but I\ncan save you. You can come with me now, or you can stay here and die.&rdquo;</p><p>Aegon glanced down at the body beside him.</p><p>This could be you.</p><p>Everything inside of him told him to stand and fight. To go\nand protect his father, to live up to his name. But he was good with a sword,\nthat didn&rsquo;t mean he was the best swordsman alive. He would be cut to pieces if\nhe dared to take on the phantom enemies in the castle. </p><p>There was a part of him that didn&rsquo;t believe the spider, but\nthere was also something like concern in the spymaster&rsquo;s face. He had never\nseen him look so concerned.</p><p>Reluctantly, Aegon pushed the blankets off him and pulled\nthe cloak that Lord Varys handed to him over his shoulders, bringing the hood\ndown over his face until Varys was satisfied that he would not easily be\nidentified. </p><p>He followed Lord Varys and the gang of men out of his\nchambers, the castle was silent as they proceeded in the darkness, occasionally\npausing as they heard footsteps in the halls and hiding in a dark corner until\nit was safe to pass. </p><p>He was led down parts of the castle he didn&rsquo;t know existed,\nplunging down further and further into the darkness until they eventually\nemerged into a small channel with a small rowboat bobbing in the water quietly,\n&ldquo;This is where I leave you, Prince Aegon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? Why&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You will be safe with these men, they will take you somewhere\nfar away, somewhere safe. There, you will learn the truth of what has happened\ntonight,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;One day, you will return. But for now, stay hidden. Don&rsquo;t\nspeak to anyone about who you are, your life depends on it.&rdquo;</p><p>Aegon swallowed hard and nodded in agreement. Lord Varys\nsmiled, and bowed to him as the men pushed the rowboat away from the rocks and\ninto the calm water, &ldquo;Until the day we meet again.&rdquo;</p><p>He watched with confused eyes as the men rowed him further\nand further out into the sea, the moonlight gleaming down on them, bathing them\nin a silver glow. The further they rowed out, the cleared the Red Keep became,\nand it was when he heard the bells begin to toll, that he knew Lord Varys spoke\nthe truth about his father.</p><p>But&hellip; why? </p><p>Who would want to kill Rhaegar Targaryen?</p><p>What about his brother? His sister? <i>Daenerys?</i></p><p>&ldquo;Wait, we need to go back,&rdquo; he ordered.</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t do that little lad,&rdquo; one of the rowers said, &ldquo;Orders\nwere to get you out, only you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We <i>need</i> to! I\nleft someone behind&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If we go back, you&rsquo;ll die&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care! I need to go back for her! I need to <i>protect</i> her!&rdquo;</p><p>Aegon began thrashing in the rowboat, readying himself to\njump out and swim back to the red keep for her. But the strong arms around him\nkept him from doing so. He shouted, screamed, and begged for them to return,\nbut every minute they moved further from the keep and out into the vast openness\nof the sea. </p><p>Once the Keep was nothing but a small speck in the distance,\nhe stopped fighting and resigned himself to his tears, thinking of those violet\neyes, and the silver hair he would never see again. Thinking of the puffy pink\nlips he would never kiss.</p><p>The soft hands he would never feel against his skin.</p><p>Her gentle smile that always made him feel weak and tremble.\n</p><p>He thought about her; about all the times they played together,\nall the times she helped him work on his penmanship, all the times she told him\nshe wished she could sword fight, and he obliged, handing her his wooden sword\nand teaching her the ways of swordsmanship. </p><p>He was vaguely aware of being pushed up the ladder of the\nside of ship, he didn&rsquo;t pay any mind to the sails, or the colors of the sails.\nAll he could think of was his father, and her. </p><p>The Keep was not visible from where he was now, all he saw was\nthe moonlight reflecting the surface of the water in a silver light, like the\ncolor of her hair. </p><p>His breathing was heavy as he lowered his hood and stared up\nat the moon, making a silent promise not only to himself, but to his father,\nand to her.</p><p><i>If you&rsquo;re alive, I&rsquo;ll come\nback for you.</i></p><p>It was all he could do as he sailed out in the unknown, in\nthe middle of the night.</p></p>",
