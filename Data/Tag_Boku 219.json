I watch a lot of anime, play a lot of games. So if there&rsquo;s a fandom not mentioned just send me a message or ask and I&rsquo;ll let you know if I think I&rsquo;m informed enough to write it for you!</p><p>I think I&rsquo;m best at one-shots, but I&rsquo;ve written a few multi-chapter stories on request in the past. </p><p>10 Things to Know:</p><p>1.  I don&rsquo;t do romantic adult/minor ships, regardless of the status of consent the request gives. <span class=\"npf_color_joey\">This is one of my very rare hard no rules. </span></p><p>2. I don&rsquo;t write incest because it just makes me personally uncomfortable.</p><p>3. I can and will write about trauma from sensitive topics, but I won&rsquo;t write the actual trauma. (I.e. I will write a request about someone dealing with sexual assault, but I&rsquo;m not writing a sexual assault scene.)</p><p>4. I accept NSFW requests, but I&rsquo;m not very good at them, because I generally feel out if my element writing it. Allow that to be a risk you take on your own entrusting me with that.</p><p>5. If you request something and don&rsquo;t like the result I give you message me, let me know what you did and didn&rsquo;t like and give me some ideas of where you&rsquo;d rather I go with it. We can work it out until you like it. </p><p>6. I do accept headcanon and story requests, but personally I believe I&rsquo;m better suited for one-shot requests.</p><p>7. FairyTailCutie used to be my handle on Fanfiction.net and my first Ao3 account (fanfiction.net deleted the account, I believe, though). If you see anything cross posted on my newest account on Ao3 be aware of this before accusing me of stealing other people&rsquo;s work. I&rsquo;m slowly working on rewriting my old work from those accounts.</p><p>8. I predominantly write F/M relationships. I also feel comfortable writing F/F requests.
