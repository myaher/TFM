The sight in front of him alone was enough to send him into a frenzy, and it was not failing in doing so now.</p><p>Pepper nodded, biting her bottom lip and heaving a sigh before leaning forward to press a kiss to her husband\u2019s charred forehead. She lingered there for a moment, and Peter almost felt like leaving simply to allow her more time with him\u2026 but denying that he wanted to speak to Tony would be the biggest lie in his entire existence. Pepper slowly got to her feet, eyes never once straying from Tony. He looked so\u2026 broken. So defeated. And yet he had just saved the world.</p><p>\u201cThere you go, Peter.\u201d The woman\u2019s voice was so soft, so quiet, that Peter barely noticed she\u2019d spoken to him. He swallowed thickly, turning to look at Pepper and noting the sympathetic gleam in her eyes. She reached out to cup the side of his face, a watery smile veiling her dry lips for just a moment before she dropped her hand and moved past him, sobs becoming all the more audible as Hope and Okoye moved to comfort her.</p><p>He suddenly felt rooted to the spot. No sound was making its way through his ears as Peter stood, legs firmly planted on the ground, arms still locked around his trembling body, except the almost deafening pumping of his heart. His breaths were coming in short gasps, and his vision was getting blurrier by the second.</p><p>And then he spoke. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Peter.\u201d Those words spilled from Tony\u2019s mouth and made him breathe in deeply, suddenly becoming all too aware of what was going on. He felt someone behind him place their hand on the small of his back, gently pushing him forward, and when he glanced around briefly he noticed it\u2019d been Steve. The man\u2019s eyes were red, pools of tears welling in the bottoms of them, but he smiled faintly when Peter turned to look at him, clearly a sign of encouragement. Either that or he was trying to make him aware of the fact that Tony probably did not have much time left, so if he wanted to speak to him, it had to be now.</p><p>The moment Tony weakly lifted his arm to stretch out toward him, the kid broke, immediately rushing over to the man and falling to his knees. He grabbed his hand, squeezing it tightly, and his heart skipped a beat when he didn\u2019t receive one in return. Though Tony was clinging on to him, it was obviously strenuous for him to do so. He was barely holding himself up as it was. \u201cTony-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI nee- need you to do me a favour, Pete.\u201d His voice was a whisper in the enveloping silence around them, and the boy\u2019s throat tightened as he heard the broken words.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Mister Stark. Anything.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s mouth was dry. He could barely speak, and yet he\u00a0<i>needed</i>\u00a0to have this conversation. \u201cWill you look after Morgan for- for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorgan?\u201d Peter\u2019s eyes narrowed the smallest bit and he absentmindedly tilted his head to the side. Doctor Strange had said they\u2019d been gone for five years, but what exactly had happened in those five years still remained a mystery. It wasn\u2019t like they\u2019d had much time to talk about it since\u2026 but he\u2019d hoped to get a chance to after everything stopped.</p><p>A small smile ghosted over Tony\u2019s lips as he stared at the kid with drooping eyes. \u201cA lot happened while you were g-gone, kiddo. I\u2026 I got a family. Pepper and me- we had a baby. Girl. Morgan.\u201d</p><p>A\u00a0<i>baby</i>? Peter couldn\u2019t stop the light from going off in those bright eyes of his. The slightest splash of colour returned to his tear-stained cheeks and he breathed a laugh. \u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded, a look of pride briefly passing across his face. He shifted, wincing immediately at the pain that shot through the whole of his right side, and Peter\u2019s face fell before he quickly rushed to comfort him. His hand fell lightly on his shoulder, the other still tightly gripping onto his hand, and the man immediately felt a surge of pure solace rush through him. \u201cWe did,\u201d he whispered. His eyes shut for the shortest moment before he blinked rapidly and turned them back on the kid. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said, \u201cp-people keep asking me\u2026 what it\u2019s like to be a dad.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded. \u201cAnd what do you tell them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI- I tell them that it\u2019s no different.\u201d He leaned his head back against the rock he was resting against, swallowing what tasted to be blood. His heart, slow as it was, sped up for the briefest of moments at the slight panicking thought that he may not be able to finish this conversation like he wanted, but he recovered quickly at the unfocused sight of Peter staring worriedly back at him. He was sure the kid had said his name a couple seconds ago. \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d he said, squeezing Peter\u2019s hand back as hard as he could.</p><p>Peter visibly deflated, shutting his eyes and sighing in what he assumed to be relief. He nodded. \u201cNo- no different to what, Mister Stark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo different to h-how it used to be\u2026 before Mor-Morgan was born. B-before Thanos.\u201d His vision was becoming hazier by the second. His head was aching tremendously. It felt as though hundreds of knives were stabbing into the entire right side of his body. His mouth was drier than the day Rhodey found him in the desert\u2026 he was fading. He hated that he was fading. And, yet, at the same time, he praised it. \u201cI\u2019d already been a dad for two years,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know it then.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Peter wondered if Tony really was starting to get confused. Was that what people did when they were dying? He wasn\u2019t sure. But, suddenly, as if he\u2019d been hit in the face by an impulse from Iron Man\u2019s blaster, he understood. The man was talking about him.\u00a0<i>Him</i>. It had, after all, been two years before he turned to dust that he\u2019d met Tony. He supposed it must be seven, now. Seven years. And he had spent five of them without him. Tears were beginning to pool in his eyes once again, and he couldn\u2019t help but sniff loudly as he shifted on one knee. \u201cYou mean that, Mister Stark?\u201d he all but squeaked.</p><p>Tony nodded once, eyes slowly beginning to lose their light. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cShould\u2019ve told yo- you that a long time ago.\u201d His head slowly fell to the side, and if it wasn\u2019t for Peter\u2019s hand quickly reaching up and cupping the side \u2013 the\u00a0<i>burning\u00a0</i>side \u2013 of his face, he probably would have dropped off there and then. But the gentle touch against his singed skin and the coldness of the Spider Man suit brought him quickly back to it all. The last of his strength was used up entirely as he moved his free hand up to place against Peter\u2019s next to his face. \u201cYou,\u201d he whispered hoarsely, \u201care one of the greatest things\u2026 to ever happen in my life, you understand? Every\u2026\u00a0<i>every</i>\u00a0good decision I\u2019ve made since meeting y-you has been be<i>cause</i>\u00a0I met you. You ch-changed me\u2026 in ways I didn\u2019t even think possible.\u201d He swallowed more blood, the metallic taste making his stomach church. \u201cYou saved my life, Peter.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s lower lip began to tremble almost as hard as the rest of his body. His face contorted into something so painful and hopeless that Tony himself felt tears begin to well in his own red eyes. \u201c<i>Yes</i>,\u201d the kid said. His broken voice was one somebody would expect to hear from a young boy who was watching his own father die. He rapidly shook his head, tears openly gushing down his face, and bent forward, placing his forehead against Tony\u2019s hand. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve just saved mine,\u201d he burst out. \u201c<i>Every</i>body\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>The lump in Tony\u2019s throat would never feel as uncomfortable as watching your child cry. He wanted to leap up, take that kid into his arms and cling on with every ounce of strength he had. But strength had long surpassed him. He did not have a\u00a0<i>fibre</i>\u00a0of it left. All he could do was sit there, paralysed with much more than fear, and watch as Peter broke into unrelentless sobs. He weakly shook his head, turning the hand resting against Peter\u2019s around so he could gently grab it and pull it off his face. He held both of them in his own, waiting for him to look up before he spoke. \u201cI did,\u201d he said, surprised at the amount of emotion in his voice. \u201cTo give you the opportunity to be- be the greatest hero o-on this goddamn earth.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019d do it again in a heartbeat if it meant you\u2019d get a chance to live a better life than I- I did.\u201d</p><p>Peter wasn\u2019t sure what kind of life he\u2019d be living after this. What was a world without Tony Stark, after all? That man had taught him everything.\u00a0<i>He\u2019d</i>\u00a0saved his life\u2026 in more ways than one. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you so much,\u201d he choked out, and Tony heaved a rattling sigh.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He used both hands to feebly pull Peter towards him, the kid soon getting the idea and moving the rest of the way into Tony\u2019s arms by himself. He was still kneeling, but resting his side against Tony\u2019s chest, and fitting his head just underneath the man\u2019s chin made him feel better. He felt two arms wrap around him, and they were nowhere near as strong as what those bear-hugs had once used to be\u2026 but it was beyond better than nothing. \u201cRemember what I said about Morgan, okay? She- I want her to grow- grow up w-with someone like you as her guide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could have been you.\u201d Peter\u2019s voice was muffled, but the man\u2019s ears had not lost their sharpness, despite the added now-constant sound of his heartbeat drumming.</p><p>\u201cIt could never have been me, Pete-\u201c A sharp pain zipped through his body, and his eyes clenched shut. He swallowed \u2013 audibly, this time \u2013 the huge amount of blood which he was sure was trying to make its way out through his mouth, not back down again, and groaned, hands around Peter dropping to his sides and fists clenching.</p><p>Peter quickly sat up, wide eyes hurriedly scanning him. \u201cTony?\u201d His voice broke. \u201cTony!\u201d</p><p>Tony grabbed his wrist, breaths coming in short gasps as he tried to control it all. He was sure he could hear the people around him voicing their concern to each other, but he was also certain \u2013 and assured \u2013 that there were people there, such as Pepper and Steve, to stop them from trying to help him. He could not be helped. Did he even want it? His eyes shot open, immediately landing on Peter. \u201cI love you,\u201d he said, voice gravelly. He did not want to rush this, but he felt as though he was on a time limit here, and it was quickly coming to an end. \u201cAlways have. I\u2019m sorry- for not showing it.\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head. \u201cI knew it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u00a0<i>did\u00a0</i>show it.\u201d And he had. Every phone call made to check in on him, every hour spent out of his day working on the Spider Man suit, every penny he spent on him, every hug, every shared laugh, every smile&hellip; they\u2019d all shown his love in the most discreet of ways, but they\u2019d done it all the same, and Peter couldn\u2019t have felt more grateful.</p><p>Tony smiled, and the kid tried his hardest to not be shocked at the blood that was quickly coating his lips. \u201cI thought so.\u201d He could barely hear his own voice, now. \u201cHey\u2026 thanks for all the dad practice you gave me. It really pro- proved useful.\u201d He smiled faintly at the breathy laugh that escaped Peter\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d he said, before hesitating. \u201cAre you in pain?\u201d</p><p>Pain. It had all gone, now. There\u2019d been an agonising moment of it\u2026 but it\u2019d faded. He felt&hellip; light. Like his soul was beginning to drift off, leaving the shell behind. There was no feeling of- of anything. He shifted slightly, shaking his head. \u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0<i>Because you\u2019re here with me.\u00a0</i>He coughed, blood dripping down from his mouth, and his face turned deathly white. Raging butterflies spawned out of nowhere in Peter\u2019s stomach, and he leaned forward, hands coming to rest on Tony\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d he called.</p><p>The warmth of Tony\u2019s life was being swept away by the cold embrace of death, and yet this cold embrace felt welcoming. He was seconds away from it, now. He could see the light, and as soon as he touched it, as soon as his fingertips brushed across it, it turned warm. Comforting. It felt like he was going home.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been an honour, son.\u201d</p><p>And, like the snap of two fingers, Tony Stark\u2019s heart beat one last time.</p>",

Every phone call made to check in on him, every hour spent out of his day working on the Spider Man suit, every penny he spent on him, every hug, every shared laugh, every smile\u2026 they\u2019d all shown his love in the most discreet of ways, but they\u2019d done it all the same, and Peter couldn\u2019t have felt more grateful.</p><p>Tony smiled, and the kid tried his hardest to not be shocked at the blood that was quickly coating his lips. \u201cI thought so.\u201d He could barely hear his own voice, now. \u201cHey\u2026 thanks for all the dad practice you gave me. It really pro- proved useful.\u201d He smiled faintly at the breathy laugh that escaped Peter\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d he said, before hesitating. \u201cAre you in pain?\u201d</p><p>Pain. It had all gone, now. There\u2019d been an agonising moment of it\u2026 but it\u2019d faded. He felt\u2026 light. Like his soul was beginning to drift off, leaving the shell behind. There was no feeling of- of anything. He shifted slightly, shaking his head. \u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0<i>Because you\u2019re here with me.\u00a0</i>He coughed, blood dripping down from his mouth, and his face turned deathly white. Raging butterflies spawned out of nowhere in Peter\u2019s stomach, and he leaned forward, hands coming to rest on Tony\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d he called.</p><p>The warmth of Tony\u2019s life was being swept away by the cold embrace of death, and yet this cold embrace felt welcoming. He was seconds away from it, now. He could see the light, and as soon as he touched it, as soon as his fingertips brushed across it, it turned warm. Comforting. It felt like he was going home.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been an honour, son.\u201d</p><p>And, like the snap of two fingers, Tony Stark\u2019s heart beat one last time.</p>",

His arms were hugging his chest as fat tears rolled down his cheeks, leaving silvery trails in their wake before falling down into the dirt. He was shivering almost violently, though he knew it was not because of any drop in temperature. The sight in front of him alone was enough to send him into a frenzy, and it was not failing in doing so now.</p><p>Pepper nodded, biting her bottom lip and heaving a sigh before leaning forward to press a kiss to her husband\u2019s charred forehead. She lingered there for a moment, and Peter almost felt like leaving simply to allow her more time with him\u2026 but denying that he wanted to speak to Tony would be the biggest lie in his entire existence. Pepper slowly got to her feet, eyes never once straying from Tony. He looked so\u2026 broken. So defeated. And yet he had just saved the world.</p><p>\u201cThere you go, Peter.\u201d The woman\u2019s voice was so soft, so quiet, that Peter barely noticed she\u2019d spoken to him. He swallowed thickly, turning to look at Pepper and noting the sympathetic gleam in her eyes. She reached out to cup the side of his face, a watery smile veiling her dry lips for just a moment before she dropped her hand and moved past him, sobs becoming all the more audible as Hope and Okoye moved to comfort her.</p><p>He suddenly felt rooted to the spot. No sound was making its way through his ears as Peter stood, legs firmly planted on the ground, arms still locked around his trembling body, except the almost deafening pumping of his heart. His breaths were coming in short gasps, and his vision was getting blurrier by the second.</p><p>And then he spoke. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Peter.\u201d Those words spilled from Tony\u2019s mouth and made him breathe in deeply, suddenly becoming all too aware of what was going on. He felt someone behind him place their hand on the small of his back, gently pushing him forward, and when he glanced around briefly he noticed it\u2019d been Steve. The man\u2019s eyes were red, pools of tears welling in the bottoms of them, but he smiled faintly when Peter turned to look at him, clearly a sign of encouragement. Either that or he was trying to make him aware of the fact that Tony probably did not have much time left, so if he wanted to speak to him, it had to be now.</p><p>The moment Tony weakly lifted his arm to stretch out toward him, the kid broke, immediately rushing over to the man and falling to his knees. He grabbed his hand, squeezing it tightly, and his heart skipped a beat when he didn\u2019t receive one in return. Though Tony was clinging on to him, it was obviously strenuous for him to do so. He was barely holding himself up as it was. \u201cTony-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI nee- need you to do me a favour, Pete.\u201d His voice was a whisper in the enveloping silence around them, and the boy\u2019s throat tightened as he heard the broken words.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Mister Stark. Anything.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s mouth was dry. He could barely speak, and yet he\u00a0<i>needed</i>\u00a0to have this conversation. \u201cWill you look after Morgan for- for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorgan?\u201d Peter\u2019s eyes narrowed the smallest bit and he absentmindedly tilted his head to the side. Doctor Strange had said they\u2019d been gone for five years, but what exactly had happened in those five years still remained a mystery. It wasn\u2019t like they\u2019d had much time to talk about it since\u2026 but he\u2019d hoped to get a chance to after everything stopped.</p><p>A small smile ghosted over Tony\u2019s lips as he stared at the kid with drooping eyes. \u201cA lot happened while you were g-gone, kiddo. I\u2026 I got a family. Pepper and me- we had a baby. Girl. Morgan.\u201d</p><p>A\u00a0<i>baby</i>? Peter couldn\u2019t stop the light from going off in those bright eyes of his. The slightest splash of colour returned to his tear-stained cheeks and he breathed a laugh. \u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded, a look of pride briefly passing across his face. He shifted, wincing immediately at the pain that shot through the whole of his right side, and Peter\u2019s face fell before he quickly rushed to comfort him. His hand fell lightly on his shoulder, the other still tightly gripping onto his hand, and the man immediately felt a surge of pure solace rush through him. \u201cWe did,\u201d he whispered. His eyes shut for the shortest moment before he blinked rapidly and turned them back on the kid. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said, \u201cp-people keep asking me\u2026 what it\u2019s like to be a dad.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded. \u201cAnd what do you tell them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI- I tell them that it\u2019s no different.\u201d He leaned his head back against the rock he was resting against, swallowing what tasted to be blood. His heart, slow as it was, sped up for the briefest of moments at the slight panicking thought that he may not be able to finish this conversation like he wanted, but he recovered quickly at the unfocused sight of Peter staring worriedly back at him. He was sure the kid had said his name a couple seconds ago. \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d he said, squeezing Peter\u2019s hand back as hard as he could.</p><p>Peter visibly deflated, shutting his eyes and sighing in what he assumed to be relief. He nodded. \u201cNo- no different to what, Mister Stark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo different to h-how it used to be\u2026 before Mor-Morgan was born. B-before Thanos.\u201d His vision was becoming hazier by the second. His head was aching tremendously. It felt as though hundreds of knives were stabbing into the entire right side of his body. His mouth was drier than the day Rhodey found him in the desert\u2026 he was fading. He hated that he was fading. And, yet, at the same time, he praised it. \u201cI\u2019d already been a dad for two years,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know it then.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Peter wondered if Tony really was starting to get confused. Was that what people did when they were dying? He wasn\u2019t sure. But, suddenly, as if he\u2019d been hit in the face by an impulse from Iron Man\u2019s blaster, he understood. The man was talking about him.\u00a0<i>Him</i>. It had, after all, been two years before he turned to dust that he\u2019d met Tony. He supposed it must be seven, now. Seven years. And he had spent five of them without him. Tears were beginning to pool in his eyes once again, and he couldn\u2019t help but sniff loudly as he shifted on one knee. \u201cYou mean that, Mister Stark?\u201d he all but squeaked.</p><p>Tony nodded once, eyes slowly beginning to lose their light. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cShould\u2019ve told yo- you that a long time ago.\u201d His head slowly fell to the side, and if it wasn\u2019t for Peter\u2019s hand quickly reaching up and cupping the side \u2013 the\u00a0<i>burning\u00a0</i>side \u2013 of his face, he probably would have dropped off there and then. But the gentle touch against his singed skin and the coldness of the Spider Man suit brought him quickly back to it all. The last of his strength was used up entirely as he moved his free hand up to place against Peter\u2019s next to his face. \u201cYou,\u201d he whispered hoarsely, \u201care one of the greatest things\u2026 to ever happen in my life, you understand? Every\u2026\u00a0<i>every</i>\u00a0good decision I\u2019ve made since meeting y-you has been be<i>cause</i>\u00a0I met you. You ch-changed me\u2026 in ways I didn\u2019t even think possible.\u201d He swallowed more blood, the metallic taste making his stomach church. \u201cYou saved my life, Peter.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s lower lip began to tremble almost as hard as the rest of his body. His face contorted into something so painful and hopeless that Tony himself felt tears begin to well in his own red eyes. \u201c<i>Yes</i>,\u201d the kid said. His broken voice was one somebody would expect to hear from a young boy who was watching his own father die. He rapidly shook his head, tears openly gushing down his face, and bent forward, placing his forehead against Tony\u2019s hand. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve just saved mine,\u201d he burst out. \u201c<i>Every</i>body\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>The lump in Tony\u2019s throat would never feel as uncomfortable as watching your child cry. He wanted to leap up, take that kid into his arms and cling on with every ounce of strength he had. But strength had long surpassed him. He did not have a\u00a0<i>fibre</i>\u00a0of it left. All he could do was sit there, paralysed with much more than fear, and watch as Peter broke into unrelentless sobs. He weakly shook his head, turning the hand resting against Peter\u2019s around so he could gently grab it and pull it off his face. He held both of them in his own, waiting for him to look up before he spoke. \u201cI did,\u201d he said, surprised at the amount of emotion in his voice. \u201cTo give you the opportunity to be- be the greatest hero o-on this goddamn earth.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019d do it again in a heartbeat if it meant you\u2019d get a chance to live a better life than I- I did.\u201d</p><p>Peter wasn\u2019t sure what kind of life he\u2019d be living after this. What was a world without Tony Stark, after all? That man had taught him everything.\u00a0<i>He\u2019d</i>\u00a0saved his life\u2026 in more ways than one. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you so much,\u201d he choked out, and Tony heaved a rattling sigh.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He used both hands to feebly pull Peter towards him, the kid soon getting the idea and moving the rest of the way into Tony\u2019s arms by himself. He was still kneeling, but resting his side against Tony\u2019s chest, and fitting his head just underneath the man\u2019s chin made him feel better. He felt two arms wrap around him, and they were nowhere near as strong as what those bear-hugs had once used to be\u2026 but it was beyond better than nothing. \u201cRemember what I said about Morgan, okay? She- I want her to grow- grow up w-with someone like you as her guide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could have been you.\u201d Peter\u2019s voice was muffled, but the man\u2019s ears had not lost their sharpness, despite the added now-constant sound of his heartbeat drumming.</p><p>\u201cIt could never have been me, Pete-\u201c A sharp pain zipped through his body, and his eyes clenched shut. He swallowed \u2013 audibly, this time \u2013 the huge amount of blood which he was sure was trying to make its way out through his mouth, not back down again, and groaned, hands around Peter dropping to his sides and fists clenching.</p><p>Peter quickly sat up, wide eyes hurriedly scanning him. \u201cTony?\u201d His voice broke. \u201cTony!\u201d</p><p>Tony grabbed his wrist, breaths coming in short gasps as he tried to control it all. He was sure he could hear the people around him voicing their concern to each other, but he was also certain \u2013 and assured \u2013 that there were people there, such as Pepper and Steve, to stop them from trying to help him. He could not be helped. Did he even want it? His eyes shot open, immediately landing on Peter. \u201cI love you,\u201d he said, voice gravelly. He did not want to rush this, but he felt as though he was on a time limit here, and it was quickly coming to an end. \u201cAlways have. I\u2019m sorry- for not showing it.\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head. \u201cI knew it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u00a0<i>did\u00a0</i>show it.\u201d And he had. Every phone call made to check in on him, every hour spent out of his day working on the Spider Man suit, every penny he spent on him, every hug, every shared laugh, every smile\u2026 they\u2019d all shown his love in the most discreet of ways, but they\u2019d done it all the same, and Peter couldn\u2019t have felt more grateful.</p><p>Tony smiled, and the kid tried his hardest to not be shocked at the blood that was quickly coating his lips. \u201cI thought so.\u201d He could barely hear his own voice, now. \u201cHey\u2026 thanks for all the dad practice you gave me.

It had all gone, now. There\u2019d been an agonising moment of it\u2026 but it\u2019d faded. He felt\u2026 light. Like his soul was beginning to drift off, leaving the shell behind.

He nodded. &ldquo;No- no different to what, Mister Stark?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No different to h-how it used to be&hellip; before Mor-Morgan was born. B-before Thanos.&rdquo; His vision was becoming hazier by the second. His head was aching tremendously. It felt as though hundreds of knives were stabbing into the entire right side of his body. His mouth was drier than the day Rhodey found him in the desert&hellip; he was fading. He hated that he was fading. And, yet, at the same time, he praised it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d already been a dad for two years,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;I just didn&rsquo;t know it then.&rdquo;</p><p>For a moment, Peter wondered if Tony really was starting to get confused. Was that what people did when they were dying? He wasn&rsquo;t sure. But, suddenly, as if he&rsquo;d been hit in the face by an impulse from Iron Man&rsquo;s blaster, he understood. The man was talking about him.&nbsp;<i>Him</i>. It had, after all, been two years before he turned to dust that he&rsquo;d met Tony. He supposed it must be seven, now. Seven years. And he had spent five of them without him. Tears were beginning to pool in his eyes once again, and he couldn&rsquo;t help but sniff loudly as he shifted on one knee. &ldquo;You mean that, Mister Stark?&rdquo; he all but squeaked.</p><p>Tony nodded once, eyes slowly beginning to lose their light. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Should&rsquo;ve told yo- you that a long time ago.&rdquo; His head slowly fell to the side, and if it wasn&rsquo;t for Peter&rsquo;s hand quickly reaching up and cupping the side &ndash; the&nbsp;<i>burning&nbsp;</i>side &ndash; of his face, he probably would have dropped off there and then. But the gentle touch against his singed skin and the coldness of the Spider Man suit brought him quickly back to it all. The last of his strength was used up entirely as he moved his free hand up to place against Peter&rsquo;s next to his face. &ldquo;You,&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely, &ldquo;are one of the greatest things&hellip; to ever happen in my life, you understand? Every&hellip;&nbsp;<i>every</i>&nbsp;good decision I&rsquo;ve made since meeting y-you has been be<i>cause</i>&nbsp;I met you. You ch-changed me&hellip; in ways I didn&rsquo;t even think possible.&rdquo; He swallowed more blood, the metallic taste making his stomach church. &ldquo;You saved my life, Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s lower lip began to tremble almost as hard as the rest of his body. His face contorted into something so painful and hopeless that Tony himself felt tears begin to well in his own red eyes. &ldquo;<i>Yes</i>,&rdquo; the kid said. His broken voice was one somebody would expect to hear from a young boy who was watching his own father die. He rapidly shook his head, tears openly gushing down his face, and bent forward, placing his forehead against Tony&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve just saved mine,&rdquo; he burst out. &ldquo;<i>Every</i>body&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>The lump in Tony&rsquo;s throat would never feel as uncomfortable as watching your child cry. He wanted to leap up, take that kid into his arms and cling on with every ounce of strength he had. But strength had long surpassed him. He did not have a&nbsp;<i>fibre</i>&nbsp;of it left. All he could do was sit there, paralysed with much more than fear, and watch as Peter broke into unrelentless sobs. He weakly shook his head, turning the hand resting against Peter&rsquo;s around so he could gently grab it and pull it off his face. He held both of them in his own, waiting for him to look up before he spoke. &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; he said, surprised at the amount of emotion in his voice. &ldquo;To give you the opportunity to be- be the greatest hero o-on this goddamn earth.&rdquo; He shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d do it again in a heartbeat if it meant you&rsquo;d get a chance to live a better life than I- I did.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter wasn&rsquo;t sure what kind of life he&rsquo;d be living after this. What was a world without Tony Stark, after all? That man had taught him everything.&nbsp;<i>He&rsquo;d</i>&nbsp;saved his life&hellip; in more ways than one. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll miss you so much,&rdquo; he choked out, and Tony heaved a rattling sigh.</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; He used both hands to feebly pull Peter towards him, the kid soon getting the idea and moving the rest of the way into Tony&rsquo;s arms by himself. He was still kneeling, but resting his side against Tony&rsquo;s chest, and fitting his head just underneath the man&rsquo;s chin made him feel better. He felt two arms wrap around him, and they were nowhere near as strong as what those bear-hugs had once used to be&hellip; but it was beyond better than nothing. &ldquo;Remember what I said about Morgan, okay? She- I want her to grow- grow up w-with someone like you as her guide.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It could have been you.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s voice was muffled, but the man&rsquo;s ears had not lost their sharpness, despite the added now-constant sound of his heartbeat drumming.</p><p>&ldquo;It could never have been me, Pete-&ldquo; A sharp pain zipped through his body, and his eyes clenched shut. He swallowed &ndash; audibly, this time &ndash; the huge amount of blood which he was sure was trying to make its way out through his mouth, not back down again, and groaned, hands around Peter dropping to his sides and fists clenching.</p><p>Peter quickly sat up, wide eyes hurriedly scanning him. &ldquo;Tony?&rdquo; His voice broke. &ldquo;Tony!&rdquo;</p><p>Tony grabbed his wrist, breaths coming in short gasps as he tried to control it all. He was sure he could hear the people around him voicing their concern to each other, but he was also certain &ndash; and assured &ndash; that there were people there, such as Pepper and Steve, to stop them from trying to help him. He could not be helped. Did he even want it? His eyes shot open, immediately landing on Peter. &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; he said, voice gravelly. He did not want to rush this, but he felt as though he was on a time limit here, and it was quickly coming to an end. &ldquo;Always have. I&rsquo;m sorry- for not showing it.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shook his head. &ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&nbsp;<i>did&nbsp;</i>show it.&rdquo; And he had. Every phone call made to check in on him, every hour spent out of his day working on the Spider Man suit, every penny he spent on him, every hug, every shared laugh, every smile&hellip; they&rsquo;d all shown his love in the most discreet of ways, but they&rsquo;d done it all the same, and Peter couldn&rsquo;t have felt more grateful.</p><p>Tony smiled, and the kid tried his hardest to not be shocked at the blood that was quickly coating his lips. &ldquo;I thought so.&rdquo; He could barely hear his own voice, now. &ldquo;Hey&hellip; thanks for all the dad practice you gave me. It really pro- proved useful.&rdquo; He smiled faintly at the breathy laugh that escaped Peter&rsquo;s lips.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; he said, before hesitating. &ldquo;Are you in pain?&rdquo;</p><p>Pain. It had all gone, now. There&rsquo;d been an agonising moment of it&hellip; but it&rsquo;d faded. He felt&hellip; light. Like his soul was beginning to drift off, leaving the shell behind. There was no feeling of- of anything. He shifted slightly, shaking his head. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;&nbsp;<i>Because you&rsquo;re here with me.&nbsp;</i>He coughed, blood dripping down from his mouth, and his face turned deathly white. Raging butterflies spawned out of nowhere in Peter&rsquo;s stomach, and he leaned forward, hands coming to rest on Tony&rsquo;s shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony!&rdquo; he called.</p><p>The warmth of Tony&rsquo;s life was being swept away by the cold embrace of death, and yet this cold embrace felt welcoming. He was seconds away from it, now. He could see the light, and as soon as he touched it, as soon as his fingertips brushed across it, it turned warm. Comforting. It felt like he was going home.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been an honour, son.&rdquo;</p><p>And, like the snap of two fingers, Tony Stark&rsquo;s heart beat one last time.</p>",
