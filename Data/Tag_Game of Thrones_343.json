You do know that he\u2019s a bastard, right? I just can\u2019t see what you see in him.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh theon, I don\u2019t care about if he\u2019s a bastard or if he\u2019s a highborn. What matters to me is that I\u2019m in love with Jon and he makes me so happy.\u201d Catherine said as her cheeks started to turn pink.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re blushing. That means you\u2019re truly in love with him, well you do know if things don\u2019t ever work out with him. You can always come to me.\u201d Theon said as confident smirk formed on his lips.<b><br/></b></p><p>\u201cOh shut up.\u201d Catherine pushed theon\u2019s arm playfully as she avoided eye contact but then met his eyes again. \u201cAnd what about you? Do you have anyone&ndash;\u201d </p><p>Catherine\u2019s voice was interrupted, \u00a0she looked to the side and noticed Jon snow standing there. He had an angry expression on his face. </p><p>\u201cJon, is everything alright?\u201d Catherine asked in a worry tone. She was about to grab Jon\u2019s arm but he backed away as if he didn\u2019t even want her to touch him. </p><p>\u201cI saw the way you looked at him. What? Do you think I\u2019m an idiot or something? You do care that I\u2019m a bastard and that I\u2019ll never be a highborn&ndash;\u201d<b><br/></b></p><p>\u201cJon, what are you talking about?\u201d Catherine asked. \u201cYou haven\u2019t heard anything that we were saying&ndash;\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, you haven\u2019t heard anything you bastard&ndash;\u201d </p><p>\u201cTheon! Don\u2019t say that&ndash;\u201d </p><p>As soon as Theon said the word bastard, Jon punched him really hard to the point where he fell down. Jon sighed and walked away from you two. </p><p>\u201cTheon, oh.. I\u2019m so sorry. I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s wrong with him but you shouldn\u2019t have called him a bastard&ndash;\u201d <br/><br/>\u201cWell he is!\u201d Theon said in an annoyed tone. </p><p>Catherine looked at Jon walking away from her, she didn\u2019t understand what was wrong with him or why he acted in such a manner. He wasn\u2019t always like this, something definitely bothered him and catherine wanted to know what but first, she had to take care of theon.<b><br/></b></p><p>In Jon\u2019s chamber, he was sitting down on the bed then he kept pacing around as he looked out the window and saw catherine helping theon. She didn\u2019t even bother to follow Jon and to check up on him. In his heart, Jon wasn\u2019t angry at catherine. He was feeling a bit sad because he\u2019ll never be a stark of winterfell like he always wanted. </p><p>He looked out and stared at the stark banners and he was staring at them longingly. The door suddenly opened and it was Jon\u2019s sister, Arya. she came inside and closed the door, her hair was all messy and her gown was as dirty as ever. Jon smiled. He knew he could always find comfort with his little sister, Arya. </p><p>\u201cHave you finished target practice yet?\u201d Jon asked. </p><p>\u201cYes, I did.\u201d Arya said as she sat down on the bed. \u201cJon, what happened out there? Why did you punch theon in the face?\u201d Arya asked in a confused tone. \u201cIs it about catherine? Or what was it about?\u201d<b><br/></b></p><p>Jon sighed and sat down with Arya on the bed, she was looking into his eyes. Jon looked back into hers to explain something to her. </p><p>\u201cI was jealous, Arya. I could never admit to catherine but I could admit it to you. I think theon is in love with catherine, I think he wants her as badly as I do. Theon is a greyjoy. He\u2019s a highborn, a prince and I\u2019m\u2026 nothing. Just a bastard. I\u2019m a snow, not a stark. How will I be able to marry her if I\u2019m just a bastard?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a stark to me.\u201d Arya said. \u201cAnd besides, I saw everything out there and I heard what catherine said to theon.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat was she saying?\u201d Jon asked. </p><p>\u201cThat she was in love with you and that your title had nothing to do with anything. She loves you, she was blushing because theon and her were talking about you. She was remembering you, Jon and that\u2019s why she was confused the moment you came and punched theon in the face.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIs that true?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt is. Would I ever lie to you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSometimes, yeah&ndash;\u201d<b><br/></b></p><p>\u201cShut up. It\u2019s just white lies, they\u2019re not real lies.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThank you arya.\u201d Jon said as he smiled softly at her. \u201cI guess, I owe catherine an apology.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to, she heard everything.\u201d Arya said as she stood up and walked towards the door to open it and the moment she did, Catherine was standing there. </p><p>\u201cWhat? Did you plan all of this?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI came here as quickly as I could.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCatherine, I\u2019m very sorry&ndash;\u201d </p><p>Catherine ran into Jon\u2019s arms and smashed her lips into his. His hands were around her back, pulling her deeply to intensify the kiss. After their lips parted away from each-other, Jon placed his forehead into hers and held catherine\u2019s hands. He brought them to his lips and kissed her hands. Catherine was smiling as she was looked up, lovingly at Jon. </p><p>Arya stared at Catherine and Jon, she had eyebrow raised and she just looked at them the whole time.<b><br/></b></p><p>\u201cSeven hells.\u201d She said before taking her leave. </p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d Catherine said. \u201cI love everything about you. Your title doesn\u2019t interest me. It\u2019s all about what\u2019s in there.\u201d she pointed at his heart and Jon was just admiring everything about her. </p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d he said. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t a bastard, we probably would have never even met so I\u2019m grateful to have met you.\u201d </p><p>Jon and Catherine were embracing each-other and outside of winterfell, the stark banners were moving with the wind. Theon was injured but he stared at the stark banners and he was only picking on Jon because he felt the same way as him. He\u2019s a greyjoy but he could never be a stark.</p>",

You do know that he\u2019s a bastard, right? I just can\u2019t see what you see in him.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh theon, I don\u2019t care about if he\u2019s a bastard or if he\u2019s a highborn. What matters to me is that I\u2019m in love with Jon and he makes me so happy.\u201d Catherine said as her cheeks started to turn pink.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re blushing. That means you\u2019re truly in love with him, well you do know if things don\u2019t ever work out with him. You can always come to me.\u201d Theon said as confident smirk formed on his lips.<b><br></b></p><p>\u201cOh shut up.\u201d Catherine pushed theon\u2019s arm playfully as she avoided eye contact but then met his eyes again. \u201cAnd what about you? Do you have anyone\u2013\u201d </p><p>Catherine\u2019s voice was interrupted, \u00a0she looked to the side and noticed Jon snow standing there. He had an angry expression on his face. </p><p>\u201cJon, is everything alright?\u201d Catherine asked in a worry tone. She was about to grab Jon\u2019s arm but he backed away as if he didn\u2019t even want her to touch him. </p><p>\u201cI saw the way you looked at him. What? Do you think I\u2019m an idiot or something? You do care that I\u2019m a bastard and that I\u2019ll never be a highborn\u2013\u201d<b><br></b></p><p>\u201cJon, what are you talking about?\u201d Catherine asked. \u201cYou haven\u2019t heard anything that we were saying\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, you haven\u2019t heard anything you bastard\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cTheon! Don\u2019t say that\u2013\u201d </p><p>As soon as Theon said the word bastard, Jon punched him really hard to the point where he fell down. Jon sighed and walked away from you two. </p><p>\u201cTheon, oh.. I\u2019m so sorry. I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s wrong with him but you shouldn\u2019t have called him a bastard\u2013\u201d <br><br>\u201cWell he is!\u201d Theon said in an annoyed tone. </p><p>Catherine looked at Jon walking away from her, she didn\u2019t understand what was wrong with him or why he acted in such a manner. He wasn\u2019t always like this, something definitely bothered him and catherine wanted to know what but first, she had to take care of theon.<b><br></b></p><p>In Jon\u2019s chamber, he was sitting down on the bed then he kept pacing around as he looked out the window and saw catherine helping theon. She didn\u2019t even bother to follow Jon and to check up on him. In his heart, Jon wasn\u2019t angry at catherine. He was feeling a bit sad because he\u2019ll never be a stark of winterfell like he always wanted. </p><p>He looked out and stared at the stark banners and he was staring at them longingly. The door suddenly opened and it was Jon\u2019s sister, Arya. she came inside and closed the door, her hair was all messy and her gown was as dirty as ever. Jon smiled. He knew he could always find comfort with his little sister, Arya. </p><p>\u201cHave you finished target practice yet?\u201d Jon asked. </p><p>\u201cYes, I did.\u201d Arya said as she sat down on the bed. \u201cJon, what happened out there? Why did you punch theon in the face?\u201d Arya asked in a confused tone. \u201cIs it about catherine? Or what was it about?\u201d<b><br></b></p><p>Jon sighed and sat down with Arya on the bed, she was looking into his eyes. Jon looked back into hers to explain something to her. </p><p>\u201cI was jealous, Arya. I could never admit to catherine but I could admit it to you. I think theon is in love with catherine, I think he wants her as badly as I do. Theon is a greyjoy. He\u2019s a highborn, a prince and I\u2019m\u2026 nothing. Just a bastard. I\u2019m a snow, not a stark. How will I be able to marry her if I\u2019m just a bastard?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a stark to me.\u201d Arya said. \u201cAnd besides, I saw everything out there and I heard what catherine said to theon.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat was she saying?\u201d Jon asked. </p><p>\u201cThat she was in love with you and that your title had nothing to do with anything. She loves you, she was blushing because theon and her were talking about you. She was remembering you, Jon and that\u2019s why she was confused the moment you came and punched theon in the face.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIs that true?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt is. Would I ever lie to you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSometimes, yeah\u2013\u201d<b><br></b></p><p>\u201cShut up. It\u2019s just white lies, they\u2019re not real lies.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThank you arya.\u201d Jon said as he smiled softly at her. \u201cI guess, I owe catherine an apology.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to, she heard everything.\u201d Arya said as she stood up and walked towards the door to open it and the moment she did, Catherine was standing there. </p><p>\u201cWhat? Did you plan all of this?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI came here as quickly as I could.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCatherine, I\u2019m very sorry\u2013\u201d </p><p>Catherine ran into Jon\u2019s arms and smashed her lips into his. His hands were around her back, pulling her deeply to intensify the kiss. After their lips parted away from each-other, Jon placed his forehead into hers and held catherine\u2019s hands. He brought them to his lips and kissed her hands. Catherine was smiling as she was looked up, lovingly at Jon. </p><p>Arya stared at Catherine and Jon, she had eyebrow raised and she just looked at them the whole time.<b><br></b></p><p>\u201cSeven hells.\u201d She said before taking her leave. </p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d Catherine said. \u201cI love everything about you. Your title doesn\u2019t interest me. It\u2019s all about what\u2019s in there.\u201d she pointed at his heart and Jon was just admiring everything about her. </p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d he said. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t a bastard, we probably would have never even met so I\u2019m grateful to have met you.\u201d </p><p>Jon and Catherine were embracing each-other and outside of winterfell, the stark banners were moving with the wind. Theon was injured but he stared at the stark banners and he was only picking on Jon because he felt the same way as him. He\u2019s a greyjoy but he could never be a stark.</p>",
