Obsessed with Jaqen H'ghar and Arya Stark and the House of Black and White ;) I love Braavos above all and I hope Arya and Jaqen story will be much better in the next book than what we've got so far in the show. I also love Tyrion  Lannister (really hope he'll get better lines next season), Jon Snow and ser Bronn of the Blackwater. I ship Arya and Jaqen, Tyrion and Tysha (I believe there is hope for them in the book) , Jaime and Brienne, Sansa and Sandor though I also like the idea of Sansa reuniting with Tyrion. I believe Rhaegar Targaryen never raped  Lyanna Stark but saved her from awful Robert Baratheon.",

        "body": "<p>Half a chapter of walking, half a chapter of violence. That\u2019s Arya in the Riverlands.</p><p><b>The story so far\u2026</b><br/></p><p>Arya\u2019s journey north with Yoren and his Night\u2019s Watch recruits has taken them out of King\u2019s Landing, past refugees, and now into territory the Lannisters are attacking. The Night\u2019s Watch takes no part - it should be fine.</p><!-- more --><p><b>The Riverlands at War</b></p><p>We open with a nice view of the countryside - river, plant life, wildlife - spoiled by a corpse. The party\u2019s growing used to this sort of thing.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI told you there was bodies,\u201d Lommy announced. \u201cI could taste them in that water.\u201d\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Rather too used to this sort of thing.</p><p>Yoren gives out orders to strip the corpse of things of value. They find a few coins and a hank of blond hair in a ribbon. This nameless, forgotten soldier, corpse shapeless and swollen, literally fishfood in a river far from home, had a sweetheart. It\u2019s these little touches that GRRM uses to remind us that everyone who dies in the Riverlands here is a person. As for the people taking things off corpses, they\u2019re all numb to it now. Their need for the items is greater than respect for the original owners. In a similar vein, the party thinks nothing of raiding gardens or taking chickens that used to belong to someone else.</p><p>This isn\u2019t the only scene of peace disrupted this chapter, either. Next they come across a cottage, which might be untouched but from which pots, coin, and animals are all missing. Same with the next house, and the next, and all the fields they pass, until they arrive at the town where everyone is gone.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Finally the town came into view; a cluster of white houses spread out around the walls of the holdfast, a big sept with a shingled wooden roof, the lord\u2019s towerhouse sitting on a small rise to the west&hellip; and no sign of any people, anywhere.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Arya\u2019s observations of the Riverlands here work in eerie parallel to Jon\u2019s experiences in the lands beyond the Wall. War and the White Walkers have similar effects on the human geography of these regions. One is a threat to Westeros just as the other is. It\u2019s for this sort of reason I personally have trouble with the assertions that the War of Five Kings \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d The Lannisters and the actors in the war who buy into their mentality, with their policy of burning the fields and terrorising civilians, are the White Walkers writ small - they stop short of enslaving their victims after death, but the disruption and terror they cause are the same.</p><blockquote><p>This empty town frightened her almost as much as the burnt holdfast where they\u2019d found the crying girl and the one-armed woman. Why would people run off and leave their homes and everything? What could scare them so much?\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>What you\u2019re not seeing in this scattershot chapter-by-chapter analysis is that the <i>previous</i> chapter was a Jon one, in which the Night\u2019s Watch is finding the same sort of nothing and asking the same sort of questions.</p><p>The action of the first half the chapter is a journey around the Gods Eye as Yoren tries to get his party north. Bridges are burned, roads take them back into the fighting (the sight of smoke being another now-familiar one to the travellers), boats are missing from the town just like horses are. Ironically, Yoren sets his sights on Harrenhal as their destination, as Lady Whent has been a friend to the Watch in the past. What he doesn\u2019t know is that Tywin Lannister holds Harrenhal at this point.</p><p>As night falls in the town, Yoren orders they make camp in the abandoned keep, while Arya lobbies to leave on the basis that everyone else saw a reason to go. Yoren, however, points out that there are still some rules in Westerosi society that will keep them safe.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThing is, the folks who lived here were at war, like it or no. We\u2019re not. Night\u2019s Watch takes no part, so no man\u2019s our enemy.\u201d<br/></p></blockquote><p>Arya\u2019s mental rejoinder is an ominous one.</p><blockquote><p>And no man\u2019s our friend, she thought[.]</p></blockquote><p><b>Battle Sequence</b></p><p>Highlighting that things are going to go wrong in the armed conflict sort of way, we immediately get a description of the keep and its defences. This is what Arya and company are working with.</p><blockquote><p>The holdfast gates were studded with iron nails. Within, they found a pair of iron bars the size of saplings, with post holes in the ground and metal brackets on the gate. When they slotted the bars through the brackets, they made a huge X brace. It was no Red Keep, Yoren announced when they\u2019d explored the holdfast top to bottom, but it was better than most, and should do for a night well enough. The walls were rough unmortared stone ten feet high, with a wooden catwalk inside the battlements. There was a postern gate to the north, and Gerren discovered a trap under the straw in the old wooden barn, leading to a narrow, winding tunnel. He followed it a long way under the earth and came out by the lake.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Just to re-emphasise the danger the residents of the town thought they were in, the keep also has a haven for the townsfolk. There\u2019s a haven designed for just this sort of thing, the keep is better than most, and everyone here <i>still</i> left.</p><p>Sure enough, the warning goes up in the middle of the night. Arya heads to the aforementioned wall, her youth becoming painfully apparent when she\u2019s too short to see over the parapet (she climbs up enough to see). From this vantage point she sees the town burned. She\u2019s confused and overwhelmed by the sight.</p><blockquote><p>Arya tried to count, but they were riding too fast, torches spinning through the air as they flung them. \u201cA hundred,\u201d she said. \u201cTwo hundred, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Over the roar of the flames, she could hear shouts. \u201cThey\u2019ll come for us soon.\u201d\u00a0</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Everything seemed red or black or orange.\u00a0</p><p>The fire leapt from one house to another. Arya saw a tree consumed, the flames creeping across its branches until it stood against the night in robes of living orange.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>The chapter started on a sunny day, travelling past wheatfields along a blue-green river. Things get a bit more sinister as Arya walks between white houses and long shadows next to a lake turned red by sunset. As fire consumes the town at night, so the colour palette of the chapter changes and becomes <i>exponentially</i> bleaker.</p><p>Yoren is the one who highlights the wanton nature of this physical destruction, even before the conversation turns to fighting.</p><blockquote><p>Yoren climbed the battlement beside the gate, his faded black cloak tied to a wooden staff. \u201cYou men hold down here!\u201d he shouted. \u201cThe townfolk\u2019s gone.\u201d\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>In other words, why do this? What\u2019s the point? There are no targets of military value here, this is burning the town for no reason but to burn it. When Yoren lowers the cloak for the men to see, they give the excuse that Beric Dondarrion and his men could be here (while Arya spots the Lannister banner, to make sure the readers know who\u2019s ultimately responsible).</p><blockquote><p>\u201cAre you blind, man?\u201d Yoren waved his staff back and forth, making the cloak ripple. \u201cYou see a bloody lightning bolt?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBy night all banners look black,\u201d the knight in the spiked helm observed. \u201cOpen, or we\u2019ll know you for outlaws in league with the king\u2019s enemies.\u201d\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Convincing.</p><p>When Yoren asks for the man in charge, Amory Lorch comes forward. We\u2019ve already heard the name, both in AGoT and ACoK, as one of the men Tywin charged with burning the Riverlands. So there\u2019s more in the stack of evidence that they\u2019re just here to kill and burn, and not <i>genuinely</i> intending to find the Brotherhood Without Banners.</p><blockquote><p>Look with your eyes, Arya wanted to shout at the men below. \u201cCan\u2019t they see we\u2019re no lords or knights?\u201d she whispered.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they care, Arry,\u201d Gendry whispered back.\u00a0</p><p>And she looked at Ser Amory\u2019s face, the way Syrio had taught her to look, and she saw that he was right.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>As Arya sees.</p><p>There is nothing Yoren\u2019s party can do to defend themselves <i>but</i> fight, because Lorch\u2019s raiders have no interest in the norms of war, no interest in Watch neutrality, no interest in mercy.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cSo be it. You defy the king\u2019s command, and so proclaim yourselves rebels, black cloaks or no.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cGot me young boys in here,\u201d Yoren shouted down.</p><p>\n\u201cYoung boys and old men die the same.\u201d\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>And so the fighting starts. Here we see Arya in an actual <i>battle</i>, taking directions, defending a wall and comrades, rather than what will become more usual for her. It\u2019s a confusing mess with scared people on both sides - Arya notes that one of the dead is the same as as Jon, and there\u2019s a skinny man she feels sorry for even as she, Hot Pie and Gendry team up to kill. It\u2019s not a long battle by any means, and it\u2019s lost before Arya can really comprehend what happened.</p><blockquote><p>The night rang to the clash of steel and the cries of the wounded and dying. For a moment Arya stood uncertain, not knowing which way to go. Death was all around her.\u00a0</p><p>And then Yoren was there, shaking her, screaming in her face. \u201cBoy!\u201d he yelled, the way he always yelled it. \u201cGet out, it\u2019s done, we\u2019ve lost. Herd up all you can, you and him and the others, the boys, you get them out. Now!\u201d\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>The rest is running.</p><p><b>A Kind Child</b></p><p>Arya still has firm ideas about how the world works. Upon hearing that they\u2019re going to Harrenhal, held by Lady Whent, she thinks immediately of knights and their duties.</p><blockquote><p>Arya could reveal herself to Lady Whent, and the knights would escort her home and keep her safe. That was what knights did; they kept you safe, especially women.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Like her elder sister and younger brother, Arya <i>believes</i> the stories of brave knights. Like them, Arya will be broken of this belief, so that when the time comes Arya can make her own stories true. Note also what follows Arya\u2019s statement of belief in knights.</p><blockquote><p>Maybe Lady Whent would even help the crying girl.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Her first thought is for herself; her second is for a little girl whose name she does not know. Irritated as she is by the constant crying, Arya wants this girl to get help out of basic human decency. There\u2019s nothing in it for her. The irritation, by the by, would seem to be linked to Arya\u2019s own grief. When she\u2019s busy, she doesn\u2019t think on the crying. When she\u2019s thinking about her brothers at Winterfell\u2026</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI have lots of brothers.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou do? Are they bigger than you, or littler?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t be talking like this. Yoren said I should keep my mouth shut. \u201cBigger,\u201d she lied. \u201cThey have swords too, big longswords, and they showed me how to kill people who bother me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI was talking, not bothering.\u201d Hot Pie went off and let her alone and Arya curled up on her pallet. She could hear the crying girl from the far side of the haven. I wish she\u2019d just be quiet. Why does she have to cry all the time?\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Arya wants to cry herself, I think. Much like she takes out her frustration with her inability to perform femininity by calling sewing etc stupid, she\u2019s dealing with her homesickness by mentally lashing out at the girl who\u2019s crying when Arya can\u2019t. She physically lashes out later when the crying girl seeks Arya out in the chaos of the attack, but Arya pairs this with genuine concern:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cGet away!\u201d She wrenched her leg free. \u201cWhat are you doing up here? Run and hide someplace, you stupid.\u201d She shoved the girl away.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>She might be unsympathetic to and rough with the crying girl, but Arya refuses to abandon her.</p><blockquote><p>As they were running toward the barn, Arya spied the crying girl sitting in the middle of the chaos, surrounded by smoke and slaughter. She grabbed her by the hand and pulled her to her feet as the others raced ahead. The girl wouldn\u2019t walk, even when slapped. Arya dragged her with her right hand while she held Needle in the left.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Arya\u2019s only a child herself. Dragging the crying girl one-handed is more of an effort than most would make under the circumstances. Gendry is the other one to share Arya\u2019s concerns (whereas Hot Pie says to leave her and then leaves them both) picking up the crying girl and ultimately getting her through the tunnel.</p><p>But even that is not Arya\u2019s most extraordinary act of compassion this chapter.</p><p>As the actual trouble of the chapter starts, Jaqen H\u2019ghar starts pleading with Arya to free him and the other men in the cage with him, to help fight. Even as he does this, however, the risk to anyone who lets these men out of the cage is made apparent by Biter throwing himself against the bars \u201cfuriously.\u201d</p><p>When, at the end of the chapter, the barn is burning and with it all the animals and the three chained prisoners, Arya is the one who turns back to do something about it. This is not a minor detour.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>The fire beat at her back with hot red wings as she fled the burning barn. It felt blessedly cool outside, but men were dying all around her. She saw Koss throw down his blade to yield, and she saw them kill him where he stood. Smoke was everywhere.\u00a0</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Going back into that barn was the hardest thing she ever did. Smoke was pouring out the open door like a writhing black snake, and she could hear the screams of the poor animals inside, donkeys and horses and men.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>This is not a minor act of compassion, either. Arya cannot leave <i>anyone</i> to die in a fire like that. Not the crying girl, physically unhurt but mentally incapacitated. Not violent prisoners who\u2019ve threatened her before. It would be easy - even sensible - for her to run. Instead, she turns back and risks her own life to save people we know to be disgusting speciments of humanity, and who will later go on to terrorise the Riverlands. As an act of compassion and courage, this is <i>astounding</i>.</p><p>One might say it\u2019s a pity it was wasted on the likes of Rorge and Biter, but hell, that\u2019s the <i>point.</i>\u00a0That\u2019s how much Arya believes nobody should just be abandoned to die in a fire. That\u2019s how good a person Arya is.</p><p><b>Chapter Function</b></p><p>In terms of plot, this chapter splits Arya up from Yoren permanently, dashing the possibility of an uncomplicated return to Winterfell. Also put into play is Jaqen, Rorge, and Biter. Jaqen is of course an important part of Arya\u2019s storyline going forward, but Rorge and Biter are going to affect the Riverlands as well, as part of its continued ravaging.\u00a0</p><p>This also puts Arya in a position of authority to her fellow child escapees. Arya might be a girl, and she might be younger than her comrades, but her education (though patchy and incomplete, it\u2019s more than they have), her broader base of experience (she\u2019s seen more of the world than King\u2019s Landing), and her force of personality serve her well in this group dynamic. Arya likes being with people. Her need to have people around her to love and care for is palpable. This is where the Arya-Gendry-Hot Pie trio really starts, and it will last into ASoS.</p><p>But in many ways, it\u2019s the setting that stars in this chapter. We get a look at the geography of the Riverlands, not just the farms but a town as well, and we see how the war is destroying that geography. When other PoVs say that the Riverlands have been burned, we have this chapter to refer back to for what that looks like in the moment of the burning.</p><p><b>Miscellany</b></p><p>It\u2019s specifically mentioned that there are crops ripening and going unharvested, for those keeping track of Westeros\u2019 food situation.</p><blockquote><p>She must have slept, though she never remembered closing her eyes. She dreamed a wolf was howling, and the sound was so terrible that it woke her at once.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Arya is certain that this is a wolf\u2019s howl and that something is wrong. When others in the party dispute her, they are quickly proven wrong by the people on watch blowing a horn. I\u2019m not convinced this incident has nothing to do with Nymeria and her wolfpack, given the importance of both dreams and wolves to the magic of the Stark siblings.</p><p><b>Clothing Porn</b></p><p>Amory Lorch has ornate scrollwork on his steel breastplate, but that\u2019s about it for fancy apparel.</p><p><b>Food Porn</b></p><p>Arya manages a meal of chicken and onion.</p><p><b>Next Three Chapters</b></p><p>Cat of the Canals, AFFC - The Griffin Reborn, ADWD - Dany X, ADWD</p>",

The Night\u2019s Watch takes no part - it should be fine.</p>[[MORE]]<p><b>The Riverlands at War</b></p><p>We open with a nice view of the countryside - river, plant life, wildlife - spoiled by a corpse. The party\u2019s growing used to this sort of thing.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI told you there was bodies,\u201d Lommy announced. \u201cI could taste them in that water.\u201d\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Rather too used to this sort of thing.</p><p>Yoren gives out orders to strip the corpse of things of value. They find a few coins and a hank of blond hair in a ribbon. This nameless, forgotten soldier, corpse shapeless and swollen, literally fishfood in a river far from home, had a sweetheart. It\u2019s these little touches that GRRM uses to remind us that everyone who dies in the Riverlands here is a person. As for the people taking things off corpses, they\u2019re all numb to it now. Their need for the items is greater than respect for the original owners. In a similar vein, the party thinks nothing of raiding gardens or taking chickens that used to belong to someone else.</p><p>This isn\u2019t the only scene of peace disrupted this chapter, either. Next they come across a cottage, which might be untouched but from which pots, coin, and animals are all missing. Same with the next house, and the next, and all the fields they pass, until they arrive at the town where everyone is gone.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Finally the town came into view; a cluster of white houses spread out around the walls of the holdfast, a big sept with a shingled wooden roof, the lord\u2019s towerhouse sitting on a small rise to the west\u2026 and no sign of any people, anywhere.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Arya\u2019s observations of the Riverlands here work in eerie parallel to Jon\u2019s experiences in the lands beyond the Wall. War and the White Walkers have similar effects on the human geography of these regions. One is a threat to Westeros just as the other is. It\u2019s for this sort of reason I personally have trouble with the assertions that the War of Five Kings \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d The Lannisters and the actors in the war who buy into their mentality, with their policy of burning the fields and terrorising civilians, are the White Walkers writ small - they stop short of enslaving their victims after death, but the disruption and terror they cause are the same.</p><blockquote><p>This empty town frightened her almost as much as the burnt holdfast where they\u2019d found the crying girl and the one-armed woman. Why would people run off and leave their homes and everything? What could scare them so much?\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>What you\u2019re not seeing in this scattershot chapter-by-chapter analysis is that the <i>previous</i> chapter was a Jon one, in which the Night\u2019s Watch is finding the same sort of nothing and asking the same sort of questions.</p><p>The action of the first half the chapter is a journey around the Gods Eye as Yoren tries to get his party north. Bridges are burned, roads take them back into the fighting (the sight of smoke being another now-familiar one to the travellers), boats are missing from the town just like horses are. Ironically, Yoren sets his sights on Harrenhal as their destination, as Lady Whent has been a friend to the Watch in the past. What he doesn\u2019t know is that Tywin Lannister holds Harrenhal at this point.</p><p>As night falls in the town, Yoren orders they make camp in the abandoned keep, while Arya lobbies to leave on the basis that everyone else saw a reason to go. Yoren, however, points out that there are still some rules in Westerosi society that will keep them safe.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThing is, the folks who lived here were at war, like it or no. We\u2019re not. Night\u2019s Watch takes no part, so no man\u2019s our enemy.\u201d<br></p></blockquote><p>Arya\u2019s mental rejoinder is an ominous one.</p><blockquote><p>And no man\u2019s our friend, she thought[.]</p></blockquote><p><b>Battle Sequence</b></p><p>Highlighting that things are going to go wrong in the armed conflict sort of way, we immediately get a description of the keep and its defences. This is what Arya and company are working with.</p><blockquote><p>The holdfast gates were studded with iron nails. Within, they found a pair of iron bars the size of saplings, with post holes in the ground and metal brackets on the gate. When they slotted the bars through the brackets, they made a huge X brace. It was no Red Keep, Yoren announced when they\u2019d explored the holdfast top to bottom, but it was better than most, and should do for a night well enough. The walls were rough unmortared stone ten feet high, with a wooden catwalk inside the battlements. There was a postern gate to the north, and Gerren discovered a trap under the straw in the old wooden barn, leading to a narrow, winding tunnel. He followed it a long way under the earth and came out by the lake.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Just to re-emphasise the danger the residents of the town thought they were in, the keep also has a haven for the townsfolk. There\u2019s a haven designed for just this sort of thing, the keep is better than most, and everyone here <i>still</i> left.</p><p>Sure enough, the warning goes up in the middle of the night. Arya heads to the aforementioned wall, her youth becoming painfully apparent when she\u2019s too short to see over the parapet (she climbs up enough to see). From this vantage point she sees the town burned. She\u2019s confused and overwhelmed by the sight.</p><blockquote><p>Arya tried to count, but they were riding too fast, torches spinning through the air as they flung them. \u201cA hundred,\u201d she said. \u201cTwo hundred, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Over the roar of the flames, she could hear shouts. \u201cThey\u2019ll come for us soon.\u201d\u00a0</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Everything seemed red or black or orange.\u00a0</p><p>The fire leapt from one house to another. Arya saw a tree consumed, the flames creeping across its branches until it stood against the night in robes of living orange.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>The chapter started on a sunny day, travelling past wheatfields along a blue-green river. Things get a bit more sinister as Arya walks between white houses and long shadows next to a lake turned red by sunset. As fire consumes the town at night, so the colour palette of the chapter changes and becomes <i>exponentially</i> bleaker.</p><p>Yoren is the one who highlights the wanton nature of this physical destruction, even before the conversation turns to fighting.</p><blockquote><p>Yoren climbed the battlement beside the gate, his faded black cloak tied to a wooden staff. \u201cYou men hold down here!\u201d he shouted. \u201cThe townfolk\u2019s gone.\u201d\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>In other words, why do this? What\u2019s the point? There are no targets of military value here, this is burning the town for no reason but to burn it. When Yoren lowers the cloak for the men to see, they give the excuse that Beric Dondarrion and his men could be here (while Arya spots the Lannister banner, to make sure the readers know who\u2019s ultimately responsible).</p><blockquote><p>\u201cAre you blind, man?\u201d Yoren waved his staff back and forth, making the cloak ripple. \u201cYou see a bloody lightning bolt?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBy night all banners look black,\u201d the knight in the spiked helm observed. \u201cOpen, or we\u2019ll know you for outlaws in league with the king\u2019s enemies.\u201d\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Convincing.</p><p>When Yoren asks for the man in charge, Amory Lorch comes forward. We\u2019ve already heard the name, both in AGoT and ACoK, as one of the men Tywin charged with burning the Riverlands. So there\u2019s more in the stack of evidence that they\u2019re just here to kill and burn, and not <i>genuinely</i> intending to find the Brotherhood Without Banners.</p><blockquote><p>Look with your eyes, Arya wanted to shout at the men below. \u201cCan\u2019t they see we\u2019re no lords or knights?\u201d she whispered.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they care, Arry,\u201d Gendry whispered back.\u00a0</p><p>And she looked at Ser Amory\u2019s face, the way Syrio had taught her to look, and she saw that he was right.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>As Arya sees.</p><p>There is nothing Yoren\u2019s party can do to defend themselves <i>but</i> fight, because Lorch\u2019s raiders have no interest in the norms of war, no interest in Watch neutrality, no interest in mercy.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cSo be it. You defy the king\u2019s command, and so proclaim yourselves rebels, black cloaks or no.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cGot me young boys in here,\u201d Yoren shouted down.</p><p>\n\u201cYoung boys and old men die the same.\u201d\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>And so the fighting starts. Here we see Arya in an actual <i>battle</i>, taking directions, defending a wall and comrades, rather than what will become more usual for her. It\u2019s a confusing mess with scared people on both sides - Arya notes that one of the dead is the same as as Jon, and there\u2019s a skinny man she feels sorry for even as she, Hot Pie and Gendry team up to kill. It\u2019s not a long battle by any means, and it\u2019s lost before Arya can really comprehend what happened.</p><blockquote><p>The night rang to the clash of steel and the cries of the wounded and dying. For a moment Arya stood uncertain, not knowing which way to go. Death was all around her.\u00a0</p><p>And then Yoren was there, shaking her, screaming in her face. \u201cBoy!\u201d he yelled, the way he always yelled it. \u201cGet out, it\u2019s done, we\u2019ve lost. Herd up all you can, you and him and the others, the boys, you get them out. Now!\u201d\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>The rest is running.</p><p><b>A Kind Child</b></p><p>Arya still has firm ideas about how the world works. Upon hearing that they\u2019re going to Harrenhal, held by Lady Whent, she thinks immediately of knights and their duties.</p><blockquote><p>Arya could reveal herself to Lady Whent, and the knights would escort her home and keep her safe.

Irritated as she is by the constant crying, Arya wants this girl to get help out of basic human decency. There\u2019s nothing in it for her.

Are they bigger than you, or littler?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t be talking like this. Yoren said I should keep my mouth shut. \u201cBigger,\u201d she lied. \u201cThey have swords too, big longswords, and they showed me how to kill people who bother me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI was talking, not bothering.\u201d Hot Pie went off and let her alone and Arya curled up on her pallet.

That\u2019s Arya in the Riverlands.</p><p><b>The story so far\u2026</b><br></p><p>Arya\u2019s journey north with Yoren and his Night\u2019s Watch recruits has taken them out of King\u2019s Landing, past refugees, and now into territory the Lannisters are attacking. The Night\u2019s Watch takes no part - it should be fine.</p>[[MORE]]<p><b>The Riverlands at War</b></p><p>We open with a nice view of the countryside - river, plant life, wildlife - spoiled by a corpse. The party\u2019s growing used to this sort of thing.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI told you there was bodies,\u201d Lommy announced. \u201cI could taste them in that water.\u201d\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Rather too used to this sort of thing.</p><p>Yoren gives out orders to strip the corpse of things of value. They find a few coins and a hank of blond hair in a ribbon. This nameless, forgotten soldier, corpse shapeless and swollen, literally fishfood in a river far from home, had a sweetheart. It\u2019s these little touches that GRRM uses to remind us that everyone who dies in the Riverlands here is a person. As for the people taking things off corpses, they\u2019re all numb to it now. Their need for the items is greater than respect for the original owners. In a similar vein, the party thinks nothing of raiding gardens or taking chickens that used to belong to someone else.</p><p>This isn\u2019t the only scene of peace disrupted this chapter, either. Next they come across a cottage, which might be untouched but from which pots, coin, and animals are all missing. Same with the next house, and the next, and all the fields they pass, until they arrive at the town where everyone is gone.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Finally the town came into view; a cluster of white houses spread out around the walls of the holdfast, a big sept with a shingled wooden roof, the lord\u2019s towerhouse sitting on a small rise to the west\u2026 and no sign of any people, anywhere.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Arya\u2019s observations of the Riverlands here work in eerie parallel to Jon\u2019s experiences in the lands beyond the Wall. War and the White Walkers have similar effects on the human geography of these regions. One is a threat to Westeros just as the other is. It\u2019s for this sort of reason I personally have trouble with the assertions that the War of Five Kings \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d The Lannisters and the actors in the war who buy into their mentality, with their policy of burning the fields and terrorising civilians, are the White Walkers writ small - they stop short of enslaving their victims after death, but the disruption and terror they cause are the same.</p><blockquote><p>This empty town frightened her almost as much as the burnt holdfast where they\u2019d found the crying girl and the one-armed woman. Why would people run off and leave their homes and everything? What could scare them so much?\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>What you\u2019re not seeing in this scattershot chapter-by-chapter analysis is that the <i>previous</i> chapter was a Jon one, in which the Night\u2019s Watch is finding the same sort of nothing and asking the same sort of questions.</p><p>The action of the first half the chapter is a journey around the Gods Eye as Yoren tries to get his party north. Bridges are burned, roads take them back into the fighting (the sight of smoke being another now-familiar one to the travellers), boats are missing from the town just like horses are. Ironically, Yoren sets his sights on Harrenhal as their destination, as Lady Whent has been a friend to the Watch in the past. What he doesn\u2019t know is that Tywin Lannister holds Harrenhal at this point.</p><p>As night falls in the town, Yoren orders they make camp in the abandoned keep, while Arya lobbies to leave on the basis that everyone else saw a reason to go. Yoren, however, points out that there are still some rules in Westerosi society that will keep them safe.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThing is, the folks who lived here were at war, like it or no. We\u2019re not. Night\u2019s Watch takes no part, so no man\u2019s our enemy.\u201d<br></p></blockquote><p>Arya\u2019s mental rejoinder is an ominous one.</p><blockquote><p>And no man\u2019s our friend, she thought[.]</p></blockquote><p><b>Battle Sequence</b></p><p>Highlighting that things are going to go wrong in the armed conflict sort of way, we immediately get a description of the keep and its defences. This is what Arya and company are working with.</p><blockquote><p>The holdfast gates were studded with iron nails. Within, they found a pair of iron bars the size of saplings, with post holes in the ground and metal brackets on the gate. When they slotted the bars through the brackets, they made a huge X brace. It was no Red Keep, Yoren announced when they\u2019d explored the holdfast top to bottom, but it was better than most, and should do for a night well enough. The walls were rough unmortared stone ten feet high, with a wooden catwalk inside the battlements. There was a postern gate to the north, and Gerren discovered a trap under the straw in the old wooden barn, leading to a narrow, winding tunnel. He followed it a long way under the earth and came out by the lake.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Just to re-emphasise the danger the residents of the town thought they were in, the keep also has a haven for the townsfolk. There\u2019s a haven designed for just this sort of thing, the keep is better than most, and everyone here <i>still</i> left.</p><p>Sure enough, the warning goes up in the middle of the night. Arya heads to the aforementioned wall, her youth becoming painfully apparent when she\u2019s too short to see over the parapet (she climbs up enough to see). From this vantage point she sees the town burned. She\u2019s confused and overwhelmed by the sight.</p><blockquote><p>Arya tried to count, but they were riding too fast, torches spinning through the air as they flung them. \u201cA hundred,\u201d she said. \u201cTwo hundred, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Over the roar of the flames, she could hear shouts. \u201cThey\u2019ll come for us soon.\u201d\u00a0</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Everything seemed red or black or orange.\u00a0</p><p>The fire leapt from one house to another. Arya saw a tree consumed, the flames creeping across its branches until it stood against the night in robes of living orange.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>The chapter started on a sunny day, travelling past wheatfields along a blue-green river. Things get a bit more sinister as Arya walks between white houses and long shadows next to a lake turned red by sunset. As fire consumes the town at night, so the colour palette of the chapter changes and becomes <i>exponentially</i> bleaker.</p><p>Yoren is the one who highlights the wanton nature of this physical destruction, even before the conversation turns to fighting.</p><blockquote><p>Yoren climbed the battlement beside the gate, his faded black cloak tied to a wooden staff. \u201cYou men hold down here!\u201d he shouted. \u201cThe townfolk\u2019s gone.\u201d\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>In other words, why do this? What\u2019s the point? There are no targets of military value here, this is burning the town for no reason but to burn it. When Yoren lowers the cloak for the men to see, they give the excuse that Beric Dondarrion and his men could be here (while Arya spots the Lannister banner, to make sure the readers know who\u2019s ultimately responsible).</p><blockquote><p>\u201cAre you blind, man?\u201d Yoren waved his staff back and forth, making the cloak ripple. \u201cYou see a bloody lightning bolt?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBy night all banners look black,\u201d the knight in the spiked helm observed. \u201cOpen, or we\u2019ll know you for outlaws in league with the king\u2019s enemies.\u201d\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Convincing.</p><p>When Yoren asks for the man in charge, Amory Lorch comes forward. We\u2019ve already heard the name, both in AGoT and ACoK, as one of the men Tywin charged with burning the Riverlands. So there\u2019s more in the stack of evidence that they\u2019re just here to kill and burn, and not <i>genuinely</i> intending to find the Brotherhood Without Banners.</p><blockquote><p>Look with your eyes, Arya wanted to shout at the men below. \u201cCan\u2019t they see we\u2019re no lords or knights?\u201d she whispered.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they care, Arry,\u201d Gendry whispered back.\u00a0</p><p>And she looked at Ser Amory\u2019s face, the way Syrio had taught her to look, and she saw that he was right.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>As Arya sees.</p><p>There is nothing Yoren\u2019s party can do to defend themselves <i>but</i> fight, because Lorch\u2019s raiders have no interest in the norms of war, no interest in Watch neutrality, no interest in mercy.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cSo be it. You defy the king\u2019s command, and so proclaim yourselves rebels, black cloaks or no.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cGot me young boys in here,\u201d Yoren shouted down.</p><p>\n\u201cYoung boys and old men die the same.\u201d\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>And so the fighting starts. Here we see Arya in an actual <i>battle</i>, taking directions, defending a wall and comrades, rather than what will become more usual for her. It\u2019s a confusing mess with scared people on both sides - Arya notes that one of the dead is the same as as Jon, and there\u2019s a skinny man she feels sorry for even as she, Hot Pie and Gendry team up to kill. It\u2019s not a long battle by any means, and it\u2019s lost before Arya can really comprehend what happened.</p><blockquote><p>The night rang to the clash of steel and the cries of the wounded and dying. For a moment Arya stood uncertain, not knowing which way to go. Death was all around her.\u00a0</p><p>And then Yoren was there, shaking her, screaming in her face. \u201cBoy!\u201d he yelled, the way he always yelled it. \u201cGet out, it\u2019s done, we\u2019ve lost. Herd up all you can, you and him and the others, the boys, you get them out. Now!\u201d\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>The rest is running.</p><p><b>A Kind Child</b></p><p>Arya still has firm ideas about how the world works. Upon hearing that they\u2019re going to Harrenhal, held by Lady Whent, she thinks immediately of knights and their duties.</p><blockquote><p>Arya could reveal herself to Lady Whent, and the knights would escort her home and keep her safe. That was what knights did; they kept you safe, especially women.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Like her elder sister and younger brother, Arya <i>believes</i> the stories of brave knights. Like them, Arya will be broken of this belief, so that when the time comes Arya can make her own stories true. Note also what follows Arya\u2019s statement of belief in knights.</p><blockquote><p>Maybe Lady Whent would even help the crying girl.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Her first thought is for herself; her second is for a little girl whose name she does not know. Irritated as she is by the constant crying, Arya wants this girl to get help out of basic human decency. There\u2019s nothing in it for her. The irritation, by the by, would seem to be linked to Arya\u2019s own grief. When she\u2019s busy, she doesn\u2019t think on the crying. When she\u2019s thinking about her brothers at Winterfell\u2026</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI have lots of brothers.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou do? Are they bigger than you, or littler?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t be talking like this. Yoren said I should keep my mouth shut. \u201cBigger,\u201d she lied. \u201cThey have swords too, big longswords, and they showed me how to kill people who bother me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI was talking, not bothering.\u201d Hot Pie went off and let her alone and Arya curled up on her pallet. She could hear the crying girl from the far side of the haven. I wish she\u2019d just be quiet. Why does she have to cry all the time?\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Arya wants to cry herself, I think. Much like she takes out her frustration with her inability to perform femininity by calling sewing etc stupid, she\u2019s dealing with her homesickness by mentally lashing out at the girl who\u2019s crying when Arya can\u2019t. She physically lashes out later when the crying girl seeks Arya out in the chaos of the attack, but Arya pairs this with genuine concern:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cGet away!\u201d She wrenched her leg free. \u201cWhat are you doing up here? Run and hide someplace, you stupid.\u201d She shoved the girl away.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>She might be unsympathetic to and rough with the crying girl, but Arya refuses to abandon her.</p><blockquote><p>As they were running toward the barn, Arya spied the crying girl sitting in the middle of the chaos, surrounded by smoke and slaughter. She grabbed her by the hand and pulled her to her feet as the others raced ahead. The girl wouldn\u2019t walk, even when slapped. Arya dragged her with her right hand while she held Needle in the left.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Arya\u2019s only a child herself. Dragging the crying girl one-handed is more of an effort than most would make under the circumstances. Gendry is the other one to share Arya\u2019s concerns (whereas Hot Pie says to leave her and then leaves them both) picking up the crying girl and ultimately getting her through the tunnel.</p><p>But even that is not Arya\u2019s most extraordinary act of compassion this chapter.</p><p>As the actual trouble of the chapter starts, Jaqen H\u2019ghar starts pleading with Arya to free him and the other men in the cage with him, to help fight. Even as he does this, however, the risk to anyone who lets these men out of the cage is made apparent by Biter throwing himself against the bars \u201cfuriously.\u201d</p><p>When, at the end of the chapter, the barn is burning and with it all the animals and the three chained prisoners, Arya is the one who turns back to do something about it. This is not a minor detour.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>The fire beat at her back with hot red wings as she fled the burning barn. It felt blessedly cool outside, but men were dying all around her. She saw Koss throw down his blade to yield, and she saw them kill him where he stood. Smoke was everywhere.\u00a0</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Going back into that barn was the hardest thing she ever did. Smoke was pouring out the open door like a writhing black snake, and she could hear the screams of the poor animals inside, donkeys and horses and men.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>This is not a minor act of compassion, either. Arya cannot leave <i>anyone</i> to die in a fire like that. Not the crying girl, physically unhurt but mentally incapacitated. Not violent prisoners who\u2019ve threatened her before. It would be easy - even sensible - for her to run. Instead, she turns back and risks her own life to save people we know to be disgusting speciments of humanity, and who will later go on to terrorise the Riverlands. As an act of compassion and courage, this is <i>astounding</i>.</p><p>One might say it\u2019s a pity it was wasted on the likes of Rorge and Biter, but hell, that\u2019s the <i>point.</i>\u00a0That\u2019s how much Arya believes nobody should just be abandoned to die in a fire. That\u2019s how good a person Arya is.</p><p><b>Chapter Function</b></p><p>In terms of plot, this chapter splits Arya up from Yoren permanently, dashing the possibility of an uncomplicated return to Winterfell. Also put into play is Jaqen, Rorge, and Biter. Jaqen is of course an important part of Arya\u2019s storyline going forward, but Rorge and Biter are going to affect the Riverlands as well, as part of its continued ravaging.\u00a0</p><p>This also puts Arya in a position of authority to her fellow child escapees. Arya might be a girl, and she might be younger than her comrades, but her education (though patchy and incomplete, it\u2019s more than they have), her broader base of experience (she\u2019s seen more of the world than King\u2019s Landing), and her force of personality serve her well in this group dynamic. Arya likes being with people. Her need to have people around her to love and care for is palpable. This is where the Arya-Gendry-Hot Pie trio really starts, and it will last into ASoS.</p><p>But in many ways, it\u2019s the setting that stars in this chapter. We get a look at the geography of the Riverlands, not just the farms but a town as well, and we see how the war is destroying that geography. When other PoVs say that the Riverlands have been burned, we have this chapter to refer back to for what that looks like in the moment of the burning.</p><p><b>Miscellany</b></p><p>It\u2019s specifically mentioned that there are crops ripening and going unharvested, for those keeping track of Westeros\u2019 food situation.</p><blockquote><p>She must have slept, though she never remembered closing her eyes. She dreamed a wolf was howling, and the sound was so terrible that it woke her at once.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Arya is certain that this is a wolf\u2019s howl and that something is wrong. When others in the party dispute her, they are quickly proven wrong by the people on watch blowing a horn. I\u2019m not convinced this incident has nothing to do with Nymeria and her wolfpack, given the importance of both dreams and wolves to the magic of the Stark siblings.</p><p><b>Clothing Porn</b></p><p>Amory Lorch has ornate scrollwork on his steel breastplate, but that\u2019s about it for fancy apparel.</p><p><b>Food Porn</b></p><p>Arya manages a meal of chicken and onion.</p><p><b>Next Three Chapters</b></p><p>Cat of the Canals, AFFC - The Griffin Reborn, ADWD - Dany X, ADWD</p>",

As fire consumes the town at night, so the colour palette of the chapter changes and becomes <i>exponentially</i> bleaker.</p><p>Yoren is the one who highlights the wanton nature of this physical destruction, even before the conversation turns to fighting.</p><blockquote><p>Yoren climbed the battlement beside the gate, his faded black cloak tied to a wooden staff. &ldquo;You men hold down here!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;The townfolk&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>In other words, why do this? What&rsquo;s the point? There are no targets of military value here, this is burning the town for no reason but to burn it. When Yoren lowers the cloak for the men to see, they give the excuse that Beric Dondarrion and his men could be here (while Arya spots the Lannister banner, to make sure the readers know who&rsquo;s ultimately responsible).</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Are you blind, man?&rdquo; Yoren waved his staff back and forth, making the cloak ripple. &ldquo;You see a bloody lightning bolt?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;By night all banners look black,&rdquo; the knight in the spiked helm observed. &ldquo;Open, or we&rsquo;ll know you for outlaws in league with the king&rsquo;s enemies.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Convincing.</p><p>When Yoren asks for the man in charge, Amory Lorch comes forward. We&rsquo;ve already heard the name, both in AGoT and ACoK, as one of the men Tywin charged with burning the Riverlands. So there&rsquo;s more in the stack of evidence that they&rsquo;re just here to kill and burn, and not <i>genuinely</i> intending to find the Brotherhood Without Banners.</p><blockquote><p>Look with your eyes, Arya wanted to shout at the men below. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t they see we&rsquo;re no lords or knights?&rdquo; she whispered.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they care, Arry,&rdquo; Gendry whispered back.&nbsp;</p><p>And she looked at Ser Amory&rsquo;s face, the way Syrio had taught her to look, and she saw that he was right.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>As Arya sees.</p><p>There is nothing Yoren&rsquo;s party can do to defend themselves <i>but</i> fight, because Lorch&rsquo;s raiders have no interest in the norms of war, no interest in Watch neutrality, no interest in mercy.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;So be it. You defy the king&rsquo;s command, and so proclaim yourselves rebels, black cloaks or no.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Got me young boys in here,&rdquo; Yoren shouted down.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Young boys and old men die the same.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>And so the fighting starts. Here we see Arya in an actual <i>battle</i>, taking directions, defending a wall and comrades, rather than what will become more usual for her. It&rsquo;s a confusing mess with scared people on both sides - Arya notes that one of the dead is the same as as Jon, and there&rsquo;s a skinny man she feels sorry for even as she, Hot Pie and Gendry team up to kill. It&rsquo;s not a long battle by any means, and it&rsquo;s lost before Arya can really comprehend what happened.</p><blockquote><p>The night rang to the clash of steel and the cries of the wounded and dying. For a moment Arya stood uncertain, not knowing which way to go. Death was all around her.&nbsp;</p><p>And then Yoren was there, shaking her, screaming in her face. &ldquo;Boy!&rdquo; he yelled, the way he always yelled it. &ldquo;Get out, it&rsquo;s done, we&rsquo;ve lost. Herd up all you can, you and him and the others, the boys, you get them out. Now!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>The rest is running.</p><p><b>A Kind Child</b></p><p>Arya still has firm ideas about how the world works. Upon hearing that they&rsquo;re going to Harrenhal, held by Lady Whent, she thinks immediately of knights and their duties.</p><blockquote><p>Arya could reveal herself to Lady Whent, and the knights would escort her home and keep her safe. That was what knights did; they kept you safe, especially women.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Like her elder sister and younger brother, Arya <i>believes</i> the stories of brave knights. Like them, Arya will be broken of this belief, so that when the time comes Arya can make her own stories true. Note also what follows Arya&rsquo;s statement of belief in knights.</p><blockquote><p>Maybe Lady Whent would even help the crying girl.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Her first thought is for herself; her second is for a little girl whose name she does not know. Irritated as she is by the constant crying, Arya wants this girl to get help out of basic human decency. There&rsquo;s nothing in it for her. The irritation, by the by, would seem to be linked to Arya&rsquo;s own grief. When she&rsquo;s busy, she doesn&rsquo;t think on the crying. When she&rsquo;s thinking about her brothers at Winterfell&hellip;</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have lots of brothers.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You do? Are they bigger than you, or littler?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>I shouldn&rsquo;t be talking like this. Yoren said I should keep my mouth shut. &ldquo;Bigger,&rdquo; she lied. &ldquo;They have swords too, big longswords, and they showed me how to kill people who bother me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I was talking, not bothering.&rdquo; Hot Pie went off and let her alone and Arya curled up on her pallet. She could hear the crying girl from the far side of the haven. I wish she&rsquo;d just be quiet. Why does she have to cry all the time?&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Arya wants to cry herself, I think. Much like she takes out her frustration with her inability to perform femininity by calling sewing etc stupid, she&rsquo;s dealing with her homesickness by mentally lashing out at the girl who&rsquo;s crying when Arya can&rsquo;t. She physically lashes out later when the crying girl seeks Arya out in the chaos of the attack, but Arya pairs this with genuine concern:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Get away!&rdquo; She wrenched her leg free. &ldquo;What are you doing up here? Run and hide someplace, you stupid.&rdquo; She shoved the girl away.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>She might be unsympathetic to and rough with the crying girl, but Arya refuses to abandon her.</p><blockquote><p>As they were running toward the barn, Arya spied the crying girl sitting in the middle of the chaos, surrounded by smoke and slaughter. She grabbed her by the hand and pulled her to her feet as the others raced ahead. The girl wouldn&rsquo;t walk, even when slapped. Arya dragged her with her right hand while she held Needle in the left.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Arya&rsquo;s only a child herself. Dragging the crying girl one-handed is more of an effort than most would make under the circumstances. Gendry is the other one to share Arya&rsquo;s concerns (whereas Hot Pie says to leave her and then leaves them both) picking up the crying girl and ultimately getting her through the tunnel.</p><p>But even that is not Arya&rsquo;s most extraordinary act of compassion this chapter.</p><p>As the actual trouble of the chapter starts, Jaqen H&rsquo;ghar starts pleading with Arya to free him and the other men in the cage with him, to help fight. Even as he does this, however, the risk to anyone who lets these men out of the cage is made apparent by Biter throwing himself against the bars &ldquo;furiously.&rdquo;</p><p>When, at the end of the chapter, the barn is burning and with it all the animals and the three chained prisoners, Arya is the one who turns back to do something about it. This is not a minor detour.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The fire beat at her back with hot red wings as she fled the burning barn. It felt blessedly cool outside, but men were dying all around her. She saw Koss throw down his blade to yield, and she saw them kill him where he stood. Smoke was everywhere.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Going back into that barn was the hardest thing she ever did. Smoke was pouring out the open door like a writhing black snake, and she could hear the screams of the poor animals inside, donkeys and horses and men.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>This is not a minor act of compassion, either. Arya cannot leave <i>anyone</i> to die in a fire like that. Not the crying girl, physically unhurt but mentally incapacitated. Not violent prisoners who&rsquo;ve threatened her before. It would be easy - even sensible - for her to run. Instead, she turns back and risks her own life to save people we know to be disgusting speciments of humanity, and who will later go on to terrorise the Riverlands. As an act of compassion and courage, this is <i>astounding</i>.</p><p>One might say it&rsquo;s a pity it was wasted on the likes of Rorge and Biter, but hell, that&rsquo;s the <i>point.</i>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s how much Arya believes nobody should just be abandoned to die in a fire. That&rsquo;s how good a person Arya is.</p><p><b>Chapter Function</b></p><p>In terms of plot, this chapter splits Arya up from Yoren permanently, dashing the possibility of an uncomplicated return to Winterfell. Also put into play is Jaqen, Rorge, and Biter. Jaqen is of course an important part of Arya&rsquo;s storyline going forward, but Rorge and Biter are going to affect the Riverlands as well, as part of its continued ravaging.&nbsp;</p><p>This also puts Arya in a position of authority to her fellow child escapees. Arya might be a girl, and she might be younger than her comrades, but her education (though patchy and incomplete, it&rsquo;s more than they have), her broader base of experience (she&rsquo;s seen more of the world than King&rsquo;s Landing), and her force of personality serve her well in this group dynamic. Arya likes being with people. Her need to have people around her to love and care for is palpable. This is where the Arya-Gendry-Hot Pie trio really starts, and it will last into ASoS.</p><p>But in many ways, it&rsquo;s the setting that stars in this chapter. We get a look at the geography of the Riverlands, not just the farms but a town as well, and we see how the war is destroying that geography. When other PoVs say that the Riverlands have been burned, we have this chapter to refer back to for what that looks like in the moment of the burning.</p><p><b>Miscellany</b></p><p>It&rsquo;s specifically mentioned that there are crops ripening and going unharvested, for those keeping track of Westeros&rsquo; food situation.</p><blockquote><p>She must have slept, though she never remembered closing her eyes. She dreamed a wolf was howling, and the sound was so terrible that it woke her at once.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Arya is certain that this is a wolf&rsquo;s howl and that something is wrong. When others in the party dispute her, they are quickly proven wrong by the people on watch blowing a horn. I&rsquo;m not convinced this incident has nothing to do with Nymeria and her wolfpack, given the importance of both dreams and wolves to the magic of the Stark siblings.</p><p><b>Clothing Porn</b></p><p>Amory Lorch has ornate scrollwork on his steel breastplate, but that&rsquo;s about it for fancy apparel.</p><p><b>Food Porn</b></p><p>Arya manages a meal of chicken and onion.</p><p><b>Next Three Chapters</b></p><p>Cat of the Canals, AFFC - The Griffin Reborn, ADWD - Dany X, ADWD</p>",
