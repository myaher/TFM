        "body": "<p>Just a series of ideas I had for my AU and how I think it works in Japan. Credit goes to JK Rowling for creation of the Harry Potter series and I just made these up for funsies<br/></p><p>-The wizarding community is governed by the Japanese Delegation of Sorcery, which has a group that decides on finalizing laws and bills regarding wizarding safety and care.</p><p>-Muggles&hellip;or \u201cWandless\u201d as they prefer to call them in Japan, are taken care of more subtly\u00a0 whenever they come across magical locations or phenomenon. This is thanks in part to Obliviators taking on simple day jobs both within JDS and in the Wandless government. If a Wandless observes magic by accident, an Obliviator will calmly take their case, listen to their full story, and have their memories wiped in a tidy manner</p><p>-While there is very little importance on pureblood, both the JDS and the Mahoutokoro School of Witchcraft and Wizardry place high value on witches and wizards with talent, often encouraging them to later marry or associate themselves with peers that have similar skills. This makes competition in the school very, very serious</p><p>-Mahoutokoro is a day school, with only a small handful of students living on campus in dormitories. These cases are usually for wards of the state, young witches and wizards who are orphans or whose families are unable to care for them. <br/></p><p>-Much like their Wandless neighbors, the JDS focuses a lot of its efforts on making everything as simple and convenient as possible. A majority of wizarding patents for inventions and spells come from the JDS Department of Wizard Patents, and as such their department has the second largest number of employees aside from the Wandless Liason Office with their Obliviators. Some of the most celebrated household charms were invented here, including the Degriming Charm and the Anti-rust Jinx.<br/></p><p>-The JDS has one of the most difficult Auror programs in the world, rivaled only by MACUSA and the Ministry of Magic. This is mostly due to the fact that Aurors are constantly in the field and abroad, dealing with practitioners of the Dark Arts</p><p>-Japan has absolutely ZERO TOLERANCE for the Dark Arts, due to a long history and war that happened during the early years of Mahoutokoro. Using Dark magic at the school results in automatic expulsion and the removal of wand privileges, whereas adults similarly lose their wands and are sentenced to many years in prison. During wartime, the council of the JDS can even vote for a death penalty on these cases</p><p>-Almost all Japanese witches and wizards are part of hobby clubs or sports teams, and often save up money donated throughout the year for one group trip abroad to a location of interest to their clubs. Quidditch teams however compete rigorously against teams from other provinces for the right to go overseas and join tournaments outside of Japan</p><p>-Mahoutokoro is only one of several Asian schools of magic, but is regarded as the most important due to the intensity of their final examinations and the age of the establishment in question. They do however maintain good relations with the smaller schools throughout the country and in China, Korea, India and various other Islands and countries.</p><p>-While it is not illegal to marry a Wandless or adopt Wandless children, both the witch or wizard and the person joining their family from a Wandless background have to swear and sign jinxed papers to secrecy, wherein breaking this causes the secret-breaker to become instantly and irreversibly Confunded. This punishment has been contested for forty decades and continues to be the most heavily debated law in JDS and wizarding history.</p><p>-Japan originally had a difficult time passing laws protecting endangered magical species native to their region, due to their importance to wand cores and potion ingredients. Thankfully, famous potioneer and Mahoutokoro headmaster Ishikawa Kabuto published his master work <i>Ingenious Substitutes for Magical Use</i> which singlehandedly cut costs for potion ingredients and saved forty three species from extinction.</p><p>-The three main wand cores used in Japan are Occamy feathers, Zouwu tail hairs, and Ryusui (a breed of water dragon) heartstrings. Due to protective laws, these can only be gathered from respective sanctuaries from what the animals drop&hellip;the latter being painlessly removed and healed using a simple surgical charm. Wandmakers can use other cores, but they have to submit requests to the JDS so as to make record of appropriate and inappropriate cores<br/></p><p>-Although to be an Auror is a challenging job, those who do not have the marks for an Auror can still apply to work with maintaining magical sanctuaries for enchanted creatures. While JDS struggles to keep its plethora of mystical beasts in check, the majority of them live in the four large animal sanctuaries where witches and wizards often go visit like modern day zoos.</p><p>-A popular past time for the Japanese wizarding community is finding shrine carts&hellip;.special food carts that disappear and reappear without any known schedule. Though some claim to know the trick to finding them, no one is entirely certain how they work as the food is sold and served magically with no visible employees. Those who have attempted to run out on the bill have suffered permanent jinxes that make it difficult to sit down</p><p>-Because the making of wand is given such reverence of skill, it is considered very bad luck to snap a wand&hellip;even for a punishment. The Department of Magical Law has an entire vault where wands taken from criminals and expelled students are kept under heavy guard, each detailed with the name of the owner, the wood, core and length, how old it is, who made it and the last spell used.</p><p>-One of the biggest nuisances in the JDS is dealing with Sugata gates&hellip;.a term used for random spaces that instantly teleport you to a random location throughout the country. The Wandless have often been \u201cspirited away\u201d when encountering these Sugata gates and the JDS has yet to discover a reason to their existence</p><p>-The capital of the JDS resides in Kyoto, which had always been the spiritual capital of Japan before the Wandless relocated it to Tokyo. Unbeknownst to the Wandless, this was a move executed by the JDS and the Emperor of that time to safely eliminate suspicion of the JDS working privately with the Wandless leader to assure stability between the Wandless and wizarding world</p><p>-Like the Ministry of Magic, the JDS works directly with the leading power of the time to continue obscuring their world from the Wandless. The single exception to this rule was the council of 1931, who in a huge scandal used the Imperius Curse to control the Emperor and members of his cabinet. Several of the council members were under the Imperius Curse themselves, but over half of them did so due to having been converted by Grindelwald a year prior. It was the first and only standing case where an entire council was arrested for Dark Arts, corruption, and obstruction of justice and took sixteen years to finally prosecute them all in court.<br/></p><p>-Because of the public disdain for the Dark Arts, one of the most difficult duties of a witch or wizard in Japan is uncovering countercurses and spells to undo Dark magic damage. The exception to this case is former student Kinben Shani, who in spite of her expulsion from Mahoutokoro was very knowledgeable about how to reverse a plethora of curses and often called upon for advice on the subject.</p><p>-Rather than using owls, which are not numerous or as common in Japan, they use varying sizes of storm petrels to carry letters. Most families have two or three small ones for letters, while delivery services provide medium sized ones for packages. Mahoutokoro keeps the giant storm petrels for commuting students to and from the school.</p><p>-According the the History of Magic they hold for Japanese history, the first wizards ever to write their history were Shinto priests and monks who mistook their skills for sorcery as divine enlightenment. After legendary shaman, wizard, and scholar Wu Xian traveled over from China and educated them otherwise, they agreed to keep their powers a secret, aware they would face persecution if they did not have the safety of the state religion. Wu Xian was one of ten warlocks who founded Mahoutokoro before returning to China.</p><p>-Japan\u2019s coastal islands have one of the highest nesting grounds for dragons in the world. The JDS has spires manned 24-7 around the islands to insure they do not fly to civilian areas and maintain their numbers. <br/></p><p>-Two subjects taught at Mahoutokoro are not taught anywhere else; Haraemancy (the magical art of purification, specializing in restoring natural habitats affected by pollution, blight or plague) and the Art of Fuujin (a class that teaches students how to seal magical creatures, curses, jinxes, and violent wizards). Both of these classes are only taught to the best students and due to their high demand, they have a limited number of students permitted to attend per year.</p><p>-Mahoutokoro robes change color as a student progresses through their academic career, starting with pink for beginners and leading up to gold for fully realized students. These robes are charmed to also detect Dark Magic, and the realized potential for certain areas of specialty, and thus the way they are made are trade secrets known only to a few families passed down through the generations.</p><p>-Mahoutokoro remains on very cold terms with the wizarding school Durmstrang, due to their differing views on teaching Dark Arts. This bitter rivalry festered further when the two schools competed in Quidditch with Mahoutokoro taking the win&hellip;and half its team suffering from jinxes when the Durmstrang Keeper lost his temper.</p><p>-Because children can start learning magic at age 7, there is the choice of advancing to different wands as they age. Whereas most wizards are chosen by a wand before they begin school, a Mahoutokoro student can go through three from beginning to end.</p><p>-Family wands are considered to house the spirit of the family member who wielded them, and are regarded as family heirlooms, kept on display or in a house shrine devoted to the family member in question. This results in a great deal of criticism shot at poorer families who have to pass on the wands of deceased elders to their children when they cannot afford new wands.</p><p>-The level of skill in Mahoutokoro students ranges in these colors from beginner to graduate; pink (for new students, usually from ages 7-9), red (for underclassmen with basic understanding of the introductory cirriculum), orange (for underclassmen beginning to take on more classwork and courses), green (for students in the middle on their way to advanced courses in their chosen fields), dark blue (for advanced students who have shown proficiency in their skills), purple (for students at the top of their class taking on the most difficult exams) and ending in pure gold, for students who have completed school. Depending on the student and how long they have been there, skilled student can graduate ahead of their peers, or simply gain the golden robes at 17 when they become of age.</p><p>-One of the animals that is a protected species, beloved icon of the Japanese wizarding community, and also native only to the forests of Japan is the Greater Fire Salamander. Mistaken initially for a dragon in the early years of history, this gentle lizard nests peacefully in the wetlands of Japan. It only uses fire to cook its meals, having a delicate digestion, and eating giant, magical insects that nest in its habitat. Most of them grow to roughly seven feet long once they reach adulthood, but a few infamous ones have been known to stretch up to twenty feet.</p><p>-While their tolerance for the Dark Arts is nil, the JDS has a more lax approach to applying Perpetual Charms and Jinxes on everyday items, and in some cases animals. If a Perpetual Charm is strong enough to power an item for one hundred years, they believe it has become its own being</p><p>-One of Mahoutokoro\u2019s lingering social problems lies in its high rate of bullying in the school. Because of the fierce competition for standing out as excellent alumni, many students suffer from bullying by competitive classmates. Though teachers are pressured to cut down on bullying by actively intervening, there have been over a hundred cases of teachers caught ignoring or aiding in bullying.<br/></p>",

The Wandless have often been \u201cspirited away\u201d when encountering these Sugata gates and the JDS has yet to discover a reason to their existence</p><p>-The capital of the JDS resides in Kyoto, which had always been the spiritual capital of Japan before the Wandless relocated it to Tokyo. Unbeknownst to the Wandless, this was a move executed by the JDS and the Emperor of that time to safely eliminate suspicion of the JDS working privately with the Wandless leader to assure stability between the Wandless and wizarding world</p><p>-Like the Ministry of Magic, the JDS works directly with the leading power of the time to continue obscuring their world from the Wandless. The single exception to this rule was the council of 1931, who in a huge scandal used the Imperius Curse to control the Emperor and members of his cabinet. Several of the council members were under the Imperius Curse themselves, but over half of them did so due to having been converted by Grindelwald a year prior. It was the first and only standing case where an entire council was arrested for Dark Arts, corruption, and obstruction of justice and took sixteen years to finally prosecute them all in court.<br></p><p>-Because of the public disdain for the Dark Arts, one of the most difficult duties of a witch or wizard in Japan is uncovering countercurses and spells to undo Dark magic damage. The exception to this case is former student Kinben Shani, who in spite of her expulsion from Mahoutokoro was very knowledgeable about how to reverse a plethora of curses and often called upon for advice on the subject.</p><p>-Rather than using owls, which are not numerous or as common in Japan, they use varying sizes of storm petrels to carry letters. Most families have two or three small ones for letters, while delivery services provide medium sized ones for packages. Mahoutokoro keeps the giant storm petrels for commuting students to and from the school.</p><p>-According the the History of Magic they hold for Japanese history, the first wizards ever to write their history were Shinto priests and monks who mistook their skills for sorcery as divine enlightenment. After legendary shaman, wizard, and scholar Wu Xian traveled over from China and educated them otherwise, they agreed to keep their powers a secret, aware they would face persecution if they did not have the safety of the state religion. Wu Xian was one of ten warlocks who founded Mahoutokoro before returning to China.</p><p>-Japan\u2019s coastal islands have one of the highest nesting grounds for dragons in the world. The JDS has spires manned 24-7 around the islands to insure they do not fly to civilian areas and maintain their numbers. <br></p><p>-Two subjects taught at Mahoutokoro are not taught anywhere else; Haraemancy (the magical art of purification, specializing in restoring natural habitats affected by pollution, blight or plague) and the Art of Fuujin (a class that teaches students how to seal magical creatures, curses, jinxes, and violent wizards). Both of these classes are only taught to the best students and due to their high demand, they have a limited number of students permitted to attend per year.</p><p>-Mahoutokoro robes change color as a student progresses through their academic career, starting with pink for beginners and leading up to gold for fully realized students. These robes are charmed to also detect Dark Magic, and the realized potential for certain areas of specialty, and thus the way they are made are trade secrets known only to a few families passed down through the generations.</p><p>-Mahoutokoro remains on very cold terms with the wizarding school Durmstrang, due to their differing views on teaching Dark Arts. This bitter rivalry festered further when the two schools competed in Quidditch with Mahoutokoro taking the win\u2026and half its team suffering from jinxes when the Durmstrang Keeper lost his temper.</p><p>-Because children can start learning magic at age 7, there is the choice of advancing to different wands as they age. Whereas most wizards are chosen by a wand before they begin school, a Mahoutokoro student can go through three from beginning to end.</p><p>-Family wands are considered to house the spirit of the family member who wielded them, and are regarded as family heirlooms, kept on display or in a house shrine devoted to the family member in question. This results in a great deal of criticism shot at poorer families who have to pass on the wands of deceased elders to their children when they cannot afford new wands.</p><p>-The level of skill in Mahoutokoro students ranges in these colors from beginner to graduate; pink (for new students, usually from ages 7-9), red (for underclassmen with basic understanding of the introductory cirriculum), orange (for underclassmen beginning to take on more classwork and courses), green (for students in the middle on their way to advanced courses in their chosen fields), dark blue (for advanced students who have shown proficiency in their skills), purple (for students at the top of their class taking on the most difficult exams) and ending in pure gold, for students who have completed school. Depending on the student and how long they have been there, skilled student can graduate ahead of their peers, or simply gain the golden robes at 17 when they become of age.</p><p>-One of the animals that is a protected species, beloved icon of the Japanese wizarding community, and also native only to the forests of Japan is the Greater Fire Salamander. Mistaken initially for a dragon in the early years of history, this gentle lizard nests peacefully in the wetlands of Japan. It only uses fire to cook its meals, having a delicate digestion, and eating giant, magical insects that nest in its habitat. Most of them grow to roughly seven feet long once they reach adulthood, but a few infamous ones have been known to stretch up to twenty feet.</p><p>-While their tolerance for the Dark Arts is nil, the JDS has a more lax approach to applying Perpetual Charms and Jinxes on everyday items, and in some cases animals. If a Perpetual Charm is strong enough to power an item for one hundred years, they believe it has become its own being</p><p>-One of Mahoutokoro\u2019s lingering social problems lies in its high rate of bullying in the school. Because of the fierce competition for standing out as excellent alumni, many students suffer from bullying by competitive classmates. Though teachers are pressured to cut down on bullying by actively intervening, there have been over a hundred cases of teachers caught ignoring or aiding in bullying.<br></p>",

Credit goes to JK Rowling for creation of the Harry Potter series and I just made these up for funsies<br></p><p>-The wizarding community is governed by the Japanese Delegation of Sorcery, which has a group that decides on finalizing laws and bills regarding wizarding safety and care.</p><p>-Muggles\u2026or \u201cWandless\u201d as they prefer to call them in Japan, are taken care of more subtly\u00a0 whenever they come across magical locations or phenomenon. This is thanks in part to Obliviators taking on simple day jobs both within JDS and in the Wandless government. If a Wandless observes magic by accident, an Obliviator will calmly take their case, listen to their full story, and have their memories wiped in a tidy manner</p><p>-While there is very little importance on pureblood, both the JDS and the Mahoutokoro School of Witchcraft and Wizardry place high value on witches and wizards with talent, often encouraging them to later marry or associate themselves with peers that have similar skills. This makes competition in the school very, very serious</p><p>-Mahoutokoro is a day school, with only a small handful of students living on campus in dormitories. These cases are usually for wards of the state, young witches and wizards who are orphans or whose families are unable to care for them. <br></p><p>-Much like their Wandless neighbors, the JDS focuses a lot of its efforts on making everything as simple and convenient as possible. A majority of wizarding patents for inventions and spells come from the JDS Department of Wizard Patents, and as such their department has the second largest number of employees aside from the Wandless Liason Office with their Obliviators. Some of the most celebrated household charms were invented here, including the Degriming Charm and the Anti-rust Jinx.<br></p><p>-The JDS has one of the most difficult Auror programs in the world, rivaled only by MACUSA and the Ministry of Magic. This is mostly due to the fact that Aurors are constantly in the field and abroad, dealing with practitioners of the Dark Arts</p><p>-Japan has absolutely ZERO TOLERANCE for the Dark Arts, due to a long history and war that happened during the early years of Mahoutokoro. Using Dark magic at the school results in automatic expulsion and the removal of wand privileges, whereas adults similarly lose their wands and are sentenced to many years in prison. During wartime, the council of the JDS can even vote for a death penalty on these cases</p><p>-Almost all Japanese witches and wizards are part of hobby clubs or sports teams, and often save up money donated throughout the year for one group trip abroad to a location of interest to their clubs. Quidditch teams however compete rigorously against teams from other provinces for the right to go overseas and join tournaments outside of Japan</p><p>-Mahoutokoro is only one of several Asian schools of magic, but is regarded as the most important due to the intensity of their final examinations and the age of the establishment in question. They do however maintain good relations with the smaller schools throughout the country and in China, Korea, India and various other Islands and countries.</p><p>-While it is not illegal to marry a Wandless or adopt Wandless children, both the witch or wizard and the person joining their family from a Wandless background have to swear and sign jinxed papers to secrecy, wherein breaking this causes the secret-breaker to become instantly and irreversibly Confunded. This punishment has been contested for forty decades and continues to be the most heavily debated law in JDS and wizarding history.</p><p>-Japan originally had a difficult time passing laws protecting endangered magical species native to their region, due to their importance to wand cores and potion ingredients. Thankfully, famous potioneer and Mahoutokoro headmaster Ishikawa Kabuto published his master work <i>Ingenious Substitutes for Magical Use</i> which singlehandedly cut costs for potion ingredients and saved forty three species from extinction.</p><p>-The three main wand cores used in Japan are Occamy feathers, Zouwu tail hairs, and Ryusui (a breed of water dragon) heartstrings. Due to protective laws, these can only be gathered from respective sanctuaries from what the animals drop\u2026the latter being painlessly removed and healed using a simple surgical charm. Wandmakers can use other cores, but they have to submit requests to the JDS so as to make record of appropriate and inappropriate cores<br></p><p>-Although to be an Auror is a challenging job, those who do not have the marks for an Auror can still apply to work with maintaining magical sanctuaries for enchanted creatures. While JDS struggles to keep its plethora of mystical beasts in check, the majority of them live in the four large animal sanctuaries where witches and wizards often go visit like modern day zoos.</p><p>-A popular past time for the Japanese wizarding community is finding shrine carts\u2026.special food carts that disappear and reappear without any known schedule. Though some claim to know the trick to finding them, no one is entirely certain how they work as the food is sold and served magically with no visible employees.

Depending on the student and how long they have been there, skilled student can graduate ahead of their peers, or simply gain the golden robes at 17 when they become of age.</p><p>-One of the animals that is a protected species, beloved icon of the Japanese wizarding community, and also native only to the forests of Japan is the Greater Fire Salamander. Mistaken initially for a dragon in the early years of history, this gentle lizard nests peacefully in the wetlands of Japan. It only uses fire to cook its meals, having a delicate digestion, and eating giant, magical insects that nest in its habitat. Most of them grow to roughly seven feet long once they reach adulthood, but a few infamous ones have been known to stretch up to twenty feet.</p><p>-While their tolerance for the Dark Arts is nil, the JDS has a more lax approach to applying Perpetual Charms and Jinxes on everyday items, and in some cases animals. If a Perpetual Charm is strong enough to power an item for one hundred years, they believe it has become its own being</p><p>-One of Mahoutokoro&rsquo;s lingering social problems lies in its high rate of bullying in the school. Because of the fierce competition for standing out as excellent alumni, many students suffer from bullying by competitive classmates. Though teachers are pressured to cut down on bullying by actively intervening, there have been over a hundred cases of teachers caught ignoring or aiding in bullying.<br /></p>",
