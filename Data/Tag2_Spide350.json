Peter accidentally refers to Tony as his dad while speaking to his teacher.</i></b></p><p>Peter didn\u2019t have a dad. Not one that he could remember,\nanyway. He\u2019d been so young when his parents died, and after Ben and May had\ntaken him in, those two were all he\u2019d ever known since. They were his mother and\nfather if anything; they fed him, clothed him, cared for him, <i>loved </i>him. He\ndidn\u2019t disagree with the fact that his life had been pretty tough after Ben\npassed, but he kept going, because he still had May, and that was all he\nneeded.</p><p>But then\u2026 what if <i>May </i>died? What <i>then?</i> Those had been thoughts which used\nto flow through his brain constantly, often messing with his mind. He\u2019d never\nthought it would actually <i>happen</i>, though. He\u2019d believed at first it was normal\nfor someone who\u2019d lost pretty much everyone in their life but one to think\nabout the sudden endless things that could go wrong. He guessed not. Maybe Parker luck\n<i>was </i>all bad.</p><p>Of course, Tony had taken him in immediately. The two were\nalready pretty close before, but this just sealed all uncertainties in an\nunbreakable box. They helped with each other\u2019s pain, and all they had to\ndo was just <i>be </i>there. Peter stayed by Tony\u2019s side at all times, and Tony stayed\nby Peter\u2019s. That was how it went for the first few months the teen was living in\nthe Avengers Facility \u2013 nobody ever saw the two apart. Peter had lost his aunt\nand mother at the same time. He was broken, and Tony had been determined to fix\nthat.</p><p>And in many ways, he had.</p><p>Even now, he was <i>still </i>fixing him. And Peter was fixing\nTony.</p><p>The two were lost without each other.</p><p>They <i>needed </i>each other.</p><p>And that would never change.</p><hr><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we get to go to Paris!\u201d Ned whispered\nexcitedly, leaning over the desk slightly so Peter could hear. He glanced up\nat their history teacher, who was rattling on about something or other, and\nthen looked happily towards his best friend. His face fell at the look he was\nmet with. Peter\u2019s eyebrows were furrowed, and he was biting his bottom lip.\n\u201cPeter? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Peter took a deep breath, trying desperately to push away the thoughts currently clouding his mind. He was a mess up there; worries and anxieties and fears were colliding into each other and-</p><p>\u201cPete?\u201d</p><p>He looked up.

It\u2019d been a lifelong dream of theirs, and while he knew Tony could probably get them both on a plane to France\nwhenever they wanted, it\u2019d be extremely stupid of him to pass up on this trip. And, besides, if he <i>really </i>felt uncomfortable and wanted to come home, Tony would make it happen. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, a little shakily, \u201cI\u2019ll go.

            "comment": "<p><b>PART 1</b></p><p><b>A/N: CAN BE READ AS A ONE-SHOT.</b></p><p><b>May has died in this series, and Tony has taken Peter in. :)</b></p><hr><p><b>Title: Iron Heart</b></p><p><b>Summary: 5 times Peter called Tony his dad, and the 1 time Tony called Peter his son.</b></p><p><b>Words: 1893</b></p><hr><p><b><i>1. Peter accidentally refers to Tony as his dad while speaking to his teacher.</i></b></p><p>Peter didn\u2019t have a dad. Not one that he could remember,\nanyway. He\u2019d been so young when his parents died, and after Ben and May had\ntaken him in, those two were all he\u2019d ever known since. They were his mother and\nfather if anything; they fed him, clothed him, cared for him, <i>loved </i>him. He\ndidn\u2019t disagree with the fact that his life had been pretty tough after Ben\npassed, but he kept going, because he still had May, and that was all he\nneeded.</p><p>But then\u2026 what if <i>May </i>died? What <i>then?</i> Those had been thoughts which used\nto flow through his brain constantly, often messing with his mind. He\u2019d never\nthought it would actually <i>happen</i>, though. He\u2019d believed at first it was normal\nfor someone who\u2019d lost pretty much everyone in their life but one to think\nabout the sudden endless things that could go wrong. He guessed not. Maybe Parker luck\n<i>was </i>all bad.</p><p>Of course, Tony had taken him in immediately. The two were\nalready pretty close before, but this just sealed all uncertainties in an\nunbreakable box. They helped with each other\u2019s pain, and all they had to\ndo was just <i>be </i>there. Peter stayed by Tony\u2019s side at all times, and Tony stayed\nby Peter\u2019s. That was how it went for the first few months the teen was living in\nthe Avengers Facility \u2013 nobody ever saw the two apart. Peter had lost his aunt\nand mother at the same time. He was broken, and Tony had been determined to fix\nthat.</p><p>And in many ways, he had.</p><p>Even now, he was <i>still </i>fixing him. And Peter was fixing\nTony.</p><p>The two were lost without each other.</p><p>They <i>needed </i>each other.</p><p>And that would never change.</p><hr><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we get to go to Paris!\u201d Ned whispered\nexcitedly, leaning over the desk slightly so Peter could hear. He glanced up\nat their history teacher, who was rattling on about something or other, and\nthen looked happily towards his best friend. His face fell at the look he was\nmet with. Peter\u2019s eyebrows were furrowed, and he was biting his bottom lip.\n\u201cPeter? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Peter took a deep breath, trying desperately to push away the thoughts currently clouding his mind. He was a mess up there; worries and anxieties and fears were colliding into each other and-</p><p>\u201cPete?\u201d</p><p>He looked up. Ned was staring at him, concern written all over his face. \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d he said with a smile, \u201cjust\u2026\nit\u2019s a week-long trip. I haven\u2019t left Mr Stark at all in over two months.\u201d</p><p>Ned sighed. He knew what his best friend was talking about \u2013\nPeter hadn\u2019t really been the same since May died. His anxiety and nerves had\nbeen sky-high, and he\u2019d declined every offer to come around to his for dinner or to build lego.\nHe\u2019d be picked up by Happy \u2013 or sometimes even Tony himself \u2013 after school and taken\nstraight back to the facility where the man Ned had only met once or twice\nwould be waiting.</p><p>\u201cI know, dude,\u201d Ned said, \u201cbut it\u2019s <i>Paris!</i>\u201d He sat up as the teacher sent him a sharp glare for interrupting the class, quickly\nreturning to his conversation \u2013 albeit a little quieter \u2013 afterwards. \u201cHow many\ntimes have we talked about going to France? Come on, it\u2019ll be great! You\u2019ll\nhave <i>me!\u201d</i></p><p>Peter put his head in his hands and breathed deep, trying to\nmake his mind up.

Peter accidentally refers to Tony as his dad while speaking to his teacher.</i></b></p><p>Peter didn\u2019t have a dad. Not one that he could remember,\nanyway. He\u2019d been so young when his parents died, and after Ben and May had\ntaken him in, those two were all he\u2019d ever known since. They were his mother and\nfather if anything; they fed him, clothed him, cared for him, <i>loved </i>him. He\ndidn\u2019t disagree with the fact that his life had been pretty tough after Ben\npassed, but he kept going, because he still had May, and that was all he\nneeded.</p><p>But then\u2026 what if <i>May </i>died? What <i>then?</i> Those had been thoughts which used\nto flow through his brain constantly, often messing with his mind. He\u2019d never\nthought it would actually <i>happen</i>, though. He\u2019d believed at first it was normal\nfor someone who\u2019d lost pretty much everyone in their life but one to think\nabout the sudden endless things that could go wrong. He guessed not. Maybe Parker luck\n<i>was </i>all bad.</p><p>Of course, Tony had taken him in immediately. The two were\nalready pretty close before, but this just sealed all uncertainties in an\nunbreakable box. They helped with each other\u2019s pain, and all they had to\ndo was just <i>be </i>there. Peter stayed by Tony\u2019s side at all times, and Tony stayed\nby Peter\u2019s. That was how it went for the first few months the teen was living in\nthe Avengers Facility \u2013 nobody ever saw the two apart. Peter had lost his aunt\nand mother at the same time. He was broken, and Tony had been determined to fix\nthat.</p><p>And in many ways, he had.</p><p>Even now, he was <i>still </i>fixing him. And Peter was fixing\nTony.</p><p>The two were lost without each other.</p><p>They <i>needed </i>each other.</p><p>And that would never change.</p><hr><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we get to go to Paris!\u201d Ned whispered\nexcitedly, leaning over the desk slightly so Peter could hear. He glanced up\nat their history teacher, who was rattling on about something or other, and\nthen looked happily towards his best friend. His face fell at the look he was\nmet with. Peter\u2019s eyebrows were furrowed, and he was biting his bottom lip.\n\u201cPeter? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Peter took a deep breath, trying desperately to push away the thoughts currently clouding his mind. He was a mess up there; worries and anxieties and fears were colliding into each other and-</p><p>\u201cPete?\u201d</p><p>He looked up. Ned was staring at him, concern written all over his face. \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d he said with a smile, \u201cjust\u2026\nit\u2019s a week-long trip. I haven\u2019t left Mr Stark at all in over two months.\u201d</p><p>Ned sighed. He knew what his best friend was talking about \u2013\nPeter hadn\u2019t really been the same since May died. His anxiety and nerves had\nbeen sky-high, and he\u2019d declined every offer to come around to his for dinner or to build lego.\nHe\u2019d be picked up by Happy \u2013 or sometimes even Tony himself \u2013 after school and taken\nstraight back to the facility where the man Ned had only met once or twice\nwould be waiting.</p><p>\u201cI know, dude,\u201d Ned said, \u201cbut it\u2019s <i>Paris!</i>\u201d He sat up as the teacher sent him a sharp glare for interrupting the class, quickly\nreturning to his conversation \u2013 albeit a little quieter \u2013 afterwards. \u201cHow many\ntimes have we talked about going to France? Come on, it\u2019ll be great! You\u2019ll\nhave <i>me!\u201d</i></p><p>Peter put his head in his hands and breathed deep, trying to\nmake his mind up. On one hand, he\u2019d only returned to school a little over three weeks ago and was admittedly pretty damn terrified of the thought of leaving Tony for seven days to go to a completely different country\u2026 but, on the other,\u00a0everything Ned said had been true \u2013 the two of\nthem had wanted to visit Paris since they\u2019d met. It\u2019d been a lifelong dream of theirs, and while he knew Tony could probably get them both on a plane to France\nwhenever they wanted, it\u2019d be extremely stupid of him to pass up on this trip. And, besides, if he <i>really </i>felt uncomfortable and wanted to come home, Tony would make it happen. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, a little shakily, \u201cI\u2019ll go. But, please\u2026 I don\u2019t mean to sound\nneedy or whatever, but-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t leave you, Pete, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Ned.\u201d</p><hr><p>Peter was surprised to be asked to stay behind after class to\ntalk with his history teacher. \u201cI\u2019ll wait outside,\u201d Ned said, giving his best friend a little\nwave before following the rest of the students out the door.</p><p>\u201cMr Oakes?\u201d</p><p>The older man glanced behind him from where he was writing\non the white board, a small smile making its way onto his face. \u201cHey, Peter!\nYeah, I just wanted to ask a quick question. I won\u2019t keep you long.\u201d He stepped\naway from the board and over to his desk, seating himself on the chair while\nPeter fiddled awkwardly with the strap of his school bag.</p><p>Mr Oakes clicked a few things on his computer before turning\nto the teen stood in front of him. The look on his face was a little more\nserious, now, though Peter tried not to let it worry him too much before he\u2019d\neven heard what it was he had to say.\u00a0\u201cHow are you today, Peter?\u201d</p><p>Unexpected.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 fine? I think?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou sound unsure?\u201d The teacher didn\u2019t sound nasty\u2026 he sounded <i>concerned.</i><br></p><p>The teen put on a brave face and smiled warmly at the man, attempting to assure him he was perfectly okay.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m doing great, Mr Oakes. <i>Better.</i> I\u2019m doing better.\u201d At least <i>that </i>part was true.</p><p>Mr Oakes smiled back a little sadly, but quickly changed the subject.</p><p>\u201cRight, so, this is about the trip to\nParis. I expect you\u2019re thinking about coming with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yes, yeah. Just\u2026 yeah, I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood! That\u2019s great, Peter. As you probably know, it\u2019s mandatory that we send permission slips home for\nparents or guardians to sign, of course letting us know who\u2019s allowed on the\ntrip and who isn\u2019t. For some reason, the school wants us to email the slips\nthis year \u2013 something about saving paper \u2013 instead of printing them ourselves.\nNow, I have, uh\u2026\u201d He trailed off, and Peter mentally prepared himself for what\nhe knew was inevitably about to come out of his teacher\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201c-I\u2019ve got your Aunt May\u2019s email address here, and\u2026 ah. God.\nI\u2019m sorry, Peter, would you like me to stop?\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head, biting his lip. \u201cNo, Sir, it\u2019s\nalright. Carry on.\u201d</p><p>Mr Oakes looked unsure, but sighed and continued. \u201cI need\nyour current guardian\u2019s email address. The school hasn\u2019t gotten around to\nchanging it from your Aunt\u2019s, yet, and I\u2019d like to have it for myself anyway, if\nyou wouldn\u2019t mind, just to keep in contact with whoever is looking after you and be there in case you need me. Is that too invasive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s fine. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Do you, uh\u2026 are you staying with anyone right now?\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m staying with Mr, um\u2026 a family\nfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Could you-\u201c he reached across his desk and grabbed a\nsheet of paper and a pen, \u201c-just scribble down the email right there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Peter picked up the pen and bent down to write\nTony\u2019s personal email on the paper, thinking it would be better than one of the\nemails fans usually sent messages to that never got answered. He didn\u2019t mind the idea of both his\nteacher and Mr Stark keeping in touch\u2026 maybe it would help him out a little\nmore.</p><p>He snapped the lid back on the pen and smiled faintly, handing the\nsheet back to Mr Oakes. The man smiled back and briefly glanced down at the\nwriting. He quickly did a double-take, an almost bewildered expression finding\nits way onto his face in no time. \u201cPeter\u2026 \u2018tonys@starkindustries.com\u2019? This-\nthis is <i>Tony Stark\u2019s</i> email?\u201d</p><p>The teen really should have expected something like this, if\nhe was being honest. Jeremy Oakes was a new teacher to the school, and he\u2019d\nbeen laying low with his internship for several months now, therefore the older\nman would\u2019ve had no clue at all that Peter even <i>knew </i>the guy. He sighed and\nshrugged, a half-hearted smile gracing his lips. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m living with him.\u201d</p><p>The teacher stared, mouth hanging open the slightest bit.\n\u201cYou know- how do you <i>know </i>him?\u201d</p><p>A quick glance to the door told Peter that Ned, who was\ncurrently bouncing outside in the hallway, was getting fairly impatient, and\nthe look on Mr Oakes\u2019s face told him he really wasn\u2019t going to be going anywhere any time soon what with the inevitable onslaught of questions he was\nabout to be asked. Suddenly, without any control, he blurted out the first words that came to his mind. \u201cHe\u2019s my dad, Mr Oakes. Can I go now, please?\u201d</p><p>The room went silent. The only sound came from the ticking\nof the clock on the wall. Mr Oakes was leaning against his desk, dark eyes\npinned on the student stood in front of him. His mouth was a gaping hole, and\nPeter bet he could shoot a string of web in there without him knowing. The\nteen\u2019s cheeks were quickly getting red, the hotness of the blood rising to his\nskin making it obvious that he was probably looking like a <i>tomato </i>right now. The\nquietness of the room immediately broke, however, when Ned knocked on the door\nand poked his head inside. \u201cHey, uh, sorry to interrupt, but-\u201c he looked at his\nbest friend, \u201c-Happy\u2019s here to pick you up. I think he\u2019s getting impatient.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded, hiking his bag up a bit further before staring\nat his teacher a little embarrassingly. \u201cHe\u2019s- he\u2019s not my <i>dad,</i> Mr Oakes. I\u2019m\nsorry, I dunno where that came from. He\u2019s just\u2026 he\u2019s just my mentor. I have an\ninternship at Stark Industries\u2026 so, yeah. He gave me a room there. He feeds me,\ntakes me to school, whatever. But, that\u2019s it. Nothing else. I barely know him.\u201d</p><p>The teacher looked a little unsure, but he nodded anyway,\nletting out the breath he hadn\u2019t known he\u2019d been holding in. \u201cRight\u2026 yes,\nright, of course. Well, count yourself lucky, Peter! My kids would die to even\ncatch a <i>glimpse </i>of Tony Stark! This is his personal email, correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be speaking to him\u2026 directly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026 yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He gulped. \u201cNot intimidating at all,\u201d he mumbled\nquietly, and Peter couldn\u2019t help but smile slightly. Tony really <i>was </i>a genuine\nguy, and he\u2019d probably (definitely) show Mr Oakes that he was most <i>certainly\n</i>more than \u2018just a mentor\u2019 to Peter in no time.</p><p>A huge beep of a car startled the teen, and he turned his\nhead towards the door, seeing Ned with an almost desperate look in his eyes. Mr Oakes seemed to get the gist. \u201cYou can go, Peter. Sorry to keep you waiting. I\u2019ll get to sending this email\nto Mr Stark as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded and waved a little before jogging towards the\ndoor.</p><p>\u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d Ned asked as the two walked across\nthe hallway as quick as they could without being reprimanded for running.</p><p>Peter sighed. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>Had he really just called Mr Stark his <i>dad?</i> He mentally groaned. <i>Why?</i> That was just\u2026 it wasn\u2019t <i>like </i>that!</p><p>\u2026 right?</p><hr><p><b>A/N: This is an AU in which May is dead and Tony has taken Peter in.</b></p><p><b>Hey!

I&rsquo;m living with him.&rdquo;</p><p>The teacher stared, mouth hanging open the slightest bit.\n&ldquo;You know- how do you <i>know </i>him?&rdquo;</p><p>A quick glance to the door told Peter that Ned, who was\ncurrently bouncing outside in the hallway, was getting fairly impatient, and\nthe look on Mr Oakes&rsquo;s face told him he really wasn&rsquo;t going to be going anywhere any time soon what with the inevitable onslaught of questions he was\nabout to be asked. Suddenly, without any control, he blurted out the first words that came to his mind. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s my dad, Mr Oakes. Can I go now, please?&rdquo;</p><p>The room went silent. The only sound came from the ticking\nof the clock on the wall. Mr Oakes was leaning against his desk, dark eyes\npinned on the student stood in front of him. His mouth was a gaping hole, and\nPeter bet he could shoot a string of web in there without him knowing. The\nteen&rsquo;s cheeks were quickly getting red, the hotness of the blood rising to his\nskin making it obvious that he was probably looking like a <i>tomato </i>right now. The\nquietness of the room immediately broke, however, when Ned knocked on the door\nand poked his head inside. &ldquo;Hey, uh, sorry to interrupt, but-&ldquo; he looked at his\nbest friend, &ldquo;-Happy&rsquo;s here to pick you up. I think he&rsquo;s getting impatient.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nodded, hiking his bag up a bit further before staring\nat his teacher a little embarrassingly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s- he&rsquo;s not my <i>dad,</i> Mr Oakes. I&rsquo;m\nsorry, I dunno where that came from. He&rsquo;s just&hellip; he&rsquo;s just my mentor. I have an\ninternship at Stark Industries&hellip; so, yeah. He gave me a room there. He feeds me,\ntakes me to school, whatever. But, that&rsquo;s it. Nothing else. I barely know him.&rdquo;</p><p>The teacher looked a little unsure, but he nodded anyway,\nletting out the breath he hadn&rsquo;t known he&rsquo;d been holding in. &ldquo;Right&hellip; yes,\nright, of course. Well, count yourself lucky, Peter! My kids would die to even\ncatch a <i>glimpse </i>of Tony Stark! This is his personal email, correct?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be speaking to him&hellip; directly?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip; yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo; He gulped. &ldquo;Not intimidating at all,&rdquo; he mumbled\nquietly, and Peter couldn&rsquo;t help but smile slightly. Tony really <i>was </i>a genuine\nguy, and he&rsquo;d probably (definitely) show Mr Oakes that he was most <i>certainly\n</i>more than &lsquo;just a mentor&rsquo; to Peter in no time.</p><p>A huge beep of a car startled the teen, and he turned his\nhead towards the door, seeing Ned with an almost desperate look in his eyes. Mr Oakes seemed to get the gist. &ldquo;You can go, Peter. Sorry to keep you waiting. I&rsquo;ll get to sending this email\nto Mr Stark as soon as I can.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nodded and waved a little before jogging towards the\ndoor.</p><p>&ldquo;What took you so long?&rdquo; Ned asked as the two walked across\nthe hallway as quick as they could without being reprimanded for running.</p><p>Peter sighed. &ldquo;Never mind.&rdquo;</p><p>Had he really just called Mr Stark his <i>dad?</i> He mentally groaned. <i>Why?</i> That was just&hellip; it wasn&rsquo;t <i>like </i>that!</p><p>&hellip; right?</p><hr /><p><b>A/N: This is an AU in which May is dead and Tony has taken Peter in.</b></p><p><b>Hey!

Duties: 1. honoring visionary ancients who were centuries or millennia before their time; 2. tilting the game board so as to cast everything in a new light; 3. celebrating allegory and metaphor as scenic shortcuts to wisdom; 4. discovering the macrocosm in the microcosm; 5. measuring non-material forces which nonetheless carry weight (Umberto Eco); 6. tracking extraordinary tempests in mundane teacups; 7. finding mystical analogues to scientific breakthroughs\u2014putting the super into the natural, the other into the worldly, the meta into the physical, the para into the normal, the magical into realism; 8. puzzling over hidden, deeper meaning; 9. carrying the key, even when the lock has been lost; 10. identifying archetypes at play; 11. studying the legend, even when the map is blank; 12. searching through the deepest shadows for the bright light that cast them; 13. delving into the unfathomable in wordless awe of the inexplicable; 14. photographing background images for the insides of mystery boxes; 15. offering the inscrutable its due scrutiny; 16. endowing branches of Borgesian catacombs; 17. diagramming the sacred syllables in the mumbo jumbo; 18. believing as many as six impossible things before breakfast; 19. building 3D models of M.C. Escher's visual illusions; 20. crafting something out of nothing; 21. designing floor plans for memory palaces; 15. plundering cultural detritus; 16. bringing warmth to fuzzy logic; 17. looking through trompe l'oeil windows; 18. freeing radicals; 19. centering on marginalia; 20. navigating the ocean that roars within the seashell; 21. making the past perfect and the future less tense; 22. seeking a grand unification of hard science, soft science, and ethereal science; 23. resisting the belligerence of ignorance; 24. erecting signs on dotted lines; 25. taking a stand for poetic justice; 26. tracing constellations in the starry-eyed; 27. fighting to cure anhedonia; 28. getting in stitches over how many angels can dance on the point of a needle; 29. exploring intangible powers, from those celebrated by the world's great religions to square roots to the literary tradition (Umberto Eco); 30. directing good brain power to fanciful ends.\n\n\"It is the custom here that we go just a little beyond, that we consider each direction with the possibilities of madness and its grand, all-inclusive theatrics, where even minor dreams are worth their weight in gold, when balanced against the darkness out of which they have gestated and taken their cues from the fiercest and loveliest of all the animals.\" \u2014J.
