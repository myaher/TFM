These had to be the wrong price tags, right? All for some nice jewelry? No, they seemed to be correct, much to his horror, and disappointment. In all fairness, perhaps this was merely karma.</p><p>Haida, admittedly, was a touch late. It was already Christmas Eve, and he hadn\u2019t gotten anything for Retsuko, or Ikari. He had been so busy and stressed out with work, that he didn\u2019t even have the idea of Christmas gifts dance around in his head until just today. As if a sudden 100 ton piled onto his back, which already had a bunch of anvils on it. But whatever, he was out shopping, might as well get it over with. He went through the mall like a hawk, trying to find good sales. He had to fight to get the latest paycheck, so he wanted to make sure he wasn\u2019t breaking the bank account today. But at the same time&hellip;it was for his wife! And his son! He wanted to make it something special. They were special to him, so it made sense. So, something super important and awesome for them, and cheap enough so they can still pay the bills.</p><p>WOULD BE WONDERFUL TO FIND ONE OF THOSE, WOULDN\u2019T IT?!</p><p>But no! Everything is marked up like it\u2019s an auction! He had to get away, before his sanity was gone. He ran off, and found himself back outside. The snow, and the lights practically blinded him. He was so confused. So petrified. Christmas\u2026.wasn\u2019t always the greatest for him. It had been some time since what happened at the hospital, and the stuff that followed that Christmas, but the memory, even with all the wonderful ones that followed, is still burned into his memory. And now it plans to be even worse, with Ikari now here. Ugh, why couldn\u2019t this happen without him?! \u2026..wait, how could he even think that?! Aagh! Haida ran everywhere he could. Toy stores, make-up stores, everywhere&hellip;they were all closing down. \u201cNo&hellip;no, NO! COME ON!\u201d Haida exclaimed, as he saw time running out for him. \u201cNo, PLEASE! SOMEBODY! &hellip;anyone?!\u201d At the end, he only saw one shop left.</p><p>A secondhand store.</p><p>He shuddered. The mere embarrassment. Retsuko, a practical angel in his eyes, who deserves nothing less than ROYALTY&hellip;and here he was, buying some junk that was passed down by someone who wanted a quick buck. <i>\u201cDisgusting,\u201d</i> he thought, as he went inside. <i>\u201cYou should be ashamed of yourself. You are making a mockery out of her! What kind of man are you?!\u201d</i> But what choice did he have? Just go in, find some moderately nice stuff, and run out. That\u2019s all. Dignity be damned. He wandered the aisles, looking for something to stand out to him. What would a girl like Retsuko like? He\u2019s been with her for years now. Just a few months ago, he married her! And yet, somehow, when it comes to finding a good gift for her, he could never put two and two together, for some reason. He knows her from front to back, but here he was. Whatever. It\u2019s guessing time.</p><p>He browsed shelves up and down. It was actually impressive how much stuff you can find in one of these stores. Old video games, clothing, appliances, DVDs, toys&hellip;and yet, nothing that could potentially entice a late-20s red panda\u2026.actually, wait, he thought, what\u2019s this? He saw, in the jewelry section, a very, VERY pretty necklace. Which, alone, is not that interesting. But he looked closer, and saw&hellip;it was a rock necklace. Like, not that it was made of rock, it just had that aesthetic to it. Guitars, amps, skulls, the devil horns gesture, the works. And in it all were some lovely diamonds embedded in them. Somehow, he had a gut feeling. <i>\u201cShe\u2019s going to like this.\u201d</i> He grabbed the necklace, noticed it was 11,000 yen. Honestly? Not bad. That will do. He put it in his basket. \u201cNow, to find a toy for Ikari.\u201d What would a 2-year old be into? Probably just a blanket, still, or-</p><p>Wait.</p><p>Is that, Retsuko?</p><p>Certainly looks like her. She\u2019s just browsing the store, looking through the racks upon racks. What was she doing here? Does she know Haida was there? Is it a hallucination, to emphasize how much Haida failed by going to this store? Oh, crap! She turned towards him! He backed away, before she could notice. <i>\u201cPhew! That was a close one,\u201d</i> he thought to himself, as he suddenly eyed something. He walked closer towards what appeared to be a stuffed animal. A dinosaur, to be exact. Obviously this was own by some child at some point, as it appears one of the eyes is missing. Still, there was kind of a charm about it. Haida couldn\u2019t quite explain it, but it appealed to him in some capacity. He wondered about Ikari. Could he like it? <i>\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like he\u2019ll really notice it\u2019s worn out right now. He\u2019s 2.\u201d</i> Haida thought. So, he grabbed it. Now to pay for the stuff, and get out, before Retsuko notices him.</p><p>Walking out of that store felt weird. He accomplished what he set out to do\u2026.and yet, it still felt like something was unfinished. Come to think of it, it felt that way for every Christmas, for the past few years now. What was it? It was odd, whatever it was. Being with Retsuko managed to improve Haida\u2019s life in every capacity&hellip;except for the alleged most wonderful time of the year. For some bizarre reason, every Christmas so far has been happy, and joyous, yes! But also\u2026.empty. Incomplete. What was it? Oh, well. Probably best to head home\u2026..perhaps it was the gifts themselves? Like, they WERE, in the end, last minute gifts. It\u2019s not like he put much thought into getting them. Perhaps that was the problem? &hellip;but wait, last year, he and Retsuko paid to go see some show that evening! It was fun, they had good laughs, a beautiful night! And yet\u2026.it still felt off. Whatever it was, it was beginning to bug Haida. What was it?! WHAT?!</p><p>*bzzt bzzt*</p><p>A text. From Retsuko. He opened it up, to see what she wrote. \u201cHey, Haida! I was wondering, could you meet me and Ikari up at that soba shop in town? I think you know the one I\u2019m referring to. At least, I HOPE you do. ;)\u201d &hellip;huh. Yeah, he could actually remember which one she was talking about. Why did she want to meet there? Is that where some party is going on? \u201cHmm\u2026.alright, I guess I won\u2019t question it.\u201d He uttered, as he began making his way there.</p><p>Through the door, he could see the wife and child, bundled up in adorable little jackets ordering soba. He smiled, although truthfully, he was worried about his gifts to them. Will they like them? Will they hate them? Only one way to find out. He entered, and saw Retsuko turn to him. \u201cHoney!\u201d She exclaimed, with a bright smile on her face. He could only blush at her precious gaze. \u201cH-hey, Retsuko! Hi, Ikari!\u201d <i>\u201cChrist, I\u2019m still like before we ever went out.\u201d</i> He thought to himself, as he continued. \u201cS-so, what\u2019s up? What are we doing here?\u201d She simply giggled. \u201cI just figured it would be a bit of a special place for us. I already ordered you a bowl, just so you know.\u201d Retsuko answered. \u201cSpecial place? The hell is she talking about?\u201d Not like it mattered, as the bowls were set out, ready to be eaten. Haida scarfed his down rather quickly. Being so frantic to find a good gift meant he effectively starved himself throughout the whole day. \u201cAh, that hit the spot!\u201d He sighed out in relief, as he turned to see his wife give a tiny bit to Ikari&hellip;who promptly squirmed at the mere taste. \u201cYucky!\u201d The child exclaimed, causing the parents to laugh. \u201cOh, you\u2019ll get used to it, buddy,\u201d said Retsuko, sighing, and looking\u2026.sad? She wasn\u2019t sobbing, or anything, but Haida noticed, she didn\u2019t quite have the glow she usually does. What&hellip;what was wrong?</p><p>\u201c&hellip;Retsuko?\u201d Haida asked, concerned. \u201cHmm? Yes, sweetie?\u201d She turned to him, possibly trying to hide those hurt emotions. To no avail, alas. \u201cAre you okay? You look down.\u201d Retsuko only stared at him in shock. He clearly noticed. \u201c&hellip;um..y-y-yeah! Yeah. A-okay.\u201d \u201c&hellip;..Retsuko, you\u2019re lying. What\u2019s the matter? You can tell me.\u201d He got closer to her, seeing her worn face looking down. \u201c&hellip;.promise you won\u2019t laugh. It\u2019s not funny to me.\u201d She muttered, as he holds her hand. \u201cI promise.\u201d He replied, in the most earnest voice she possibly ever heard him speak in. She looked, and stared deep into his eyes. He had a look of worry, as if the world could suddenly disappear, at any moment. She sighed, and spoke.</p><p>\u201cI get really sad around Christmas, these past few years. About what happened at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201c&hellip;huh?\u201d Haida looked even more confused than before. \u201cI&hellip;sigh, even explaining it is weird! Okay, remember when you poured your heart out to me, at the hospital, when you got sick?\u201d \u201cI do&hellip;I recall you saying you didn\u2019t want to pursue a relationship then. Honestly, made sense, given you had just had that break-up, probably should\u2019ve thought abou-\u201d She stopped him. \u201cWell&hellip;I heard you got pretty depressed after that\u2026\u201d It had been some time since that event, so Haida had to think about it a bit. How long, 5 years ago? &hellip;wow, had it actually been that long already? \u201c&hellip;.yeah, I was pretty bummed.\u201d He suddenly answered. \u201cI&hellip;also found out that Christmas was especially hard on you, since&hellip;well, that was when I was going through that social media nonsense.\u201d \u201cI mean, I saw a picture you took with two fake wine glasses, implying you were with some dude, so yeah, that kinda put me in a bit of a funk, so\u2026\u201d He joked, but he saw she was still upset. \u201c&hellip;erm, sorry, Retsuko.\u201d \u201cIt was fine. At the time, all of that kind of just blew past me. Even our chat towards the end, which was very lovely at the time. And was a great indicator of things to come, I might add. But some time later, after we had started dating, Fenneko told me about all of it. It was just a silly drunken thing, I\u2019m assuming to her&hellip;but I couldn\u2019t get the images out of my brain. These thoughts of you in tears, drinking away your pain&hellip;all because of my own ignorance, and my shooting you down&hellip;there would be nights I would have horrible nightmares about that time, and I would wake up with tears streaming down my face. And even after we became much closer, even after Ikari was born, even now, as we\u2019re married\u2026..that feeling, of dread, of sorrow, of regret&hellip;they still hover above me.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, Haida\u2019s heart plummeted. This was someone he loved, deeply! Someone he knew as being a beacon of light in a dark dystopia such as the Japanese work environment! Obviously, he knew she wasn\u2019t always going to be happy (she DID get mad a lot), but the fact that she said all of this, that his own pitiful reactions to her decisions all those years back now haunt her? Especially around one of the happiest times of the year! She shouldn\u2019t be so depressed around this time! Oh, god, how did he never notice?! Was&hellip;was this the emptiness he was noticing? Was this the nagging feeling he had creeping around him? \u201cRetsuko\u2026,\u201d he was only able to let out, feeling like a broken man after hearing this. \u201c&hellip;I-I picked this place, because&hellip;well, it was a great place to remind me, Christmas&hellip;it\u2019s not some fancy dinner, or some big social thing you have to do, in order to be loved&hellip;it\u2019s something you spend with your family. Your friends. People you care about, people who care about you\u2026.people you love,\u201d she continued, caressing his hand. \u201c&hellip;still, even if that were the case, it doesn\u2019t change how much guilt I have for putting you through all of that. If I could, I would go back, and jump onto you in that hospital bed, saying yes until I couldn\u2019t speak anymore. Maybe all of this would\u2019ve happened sooner, if I did that, and you wouldn\u2019t have had such a bad Christmas then&hellip;.I\u2019m sorry, Haida, I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t want to hear any of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201c&hellip;.actually, Retsuko? Far from it. That\u2019s exactly what I needed to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?,\u201d she questioned, looking at the hyena, smiling warmly at her. \u201cFirstly, you\u2019re right. Christmas isn\u2019t some big thing you have to pull all the stops for. It\u2019s something you need to spend with the people around you, who care for you. Something I probably should\u2019ve remembered earlier today, honestly.\u201d He looked away, slightly embarassed. \u201cOh, right, when you were at the secondhand store? I saw.\u201d Retsuko winked, making Haida beet red. \u201cTHAT BEING SAID&hellip;secondly\u2026.you know, maybe if you had said yes at the hospital, things would have happened sooner\u2026.but by that same token\u2026.they may not have happened at all. We don\u2019t know what would\u2019ve happened to us. The fact is it happened, and now we\u2019re at this point in our lives. Even back at that time, I just considered that moment \u2018ancient history\u2019, and just tried to move on, occasionally trying again&hellip;to little avail, sure, but it was something. And yet, look where all of that got us to. We\u2019re now married. We have a son. We\u2019re living pretty alright, right now. And we got friends and families that have our backs, no matter what\u2026.what I\u2019m saying is, if given the chance to change the events of that day, I wouldn\u2019t change a single second. If it meant being in the same home with you, being able to help you put Ikari to bed, helping you deal with all the bullshit at work, hearing you scream your head off, if it means being able to wake up to you, in my arms, desperately trying to get up for work, and us saying that we love each other, if it means all of that\u2026&hellip;I\u2019m willing to take the heartbreak of that day a hundred times over.\u201d</p><p>The shop went silent.</p><p>\u201cH-Haida\u2026\u201d Retsuko uttered, before jumping him, and giving him a long, tight embrace. Haida was taken aback slightly, before holding her closely as well. Ikari gently walked towards them, and joined in the hug. \u201c&hellip;isn\u2019t Christmas wonderful, Haida?,\u201d asked Retsuko. \u201cIt is\u2026.speaking of, probably should get the gifts out of the way, huh?\u201d They break the hug, as Haida grabs out his presents to them. \u201cP-please understand, I was rushing, I only got around to getting these today\u2026\u201d He held out the gifts, the necklace to Retsuko, and the dinosaur to Ikari, wincing away. Retsuko was the first to react, a gasp coming from her. \u201cOh, Haida, I love it! It\u2019s beautiful!\u201d She exclaimed, observing the necklace, and every detail on it. Ikari simply grabbed the dinosaur, and proceeded to hug it tightly. Haida only looked, a bit in shock. \u201c&hellip;huh. I somehow wasn\u2019t expecting any of this. I guess I just thought&hellip;well, it was you guys, I didn\u2019t want to seem like I was disappointing you,\u201d said Haida, with which Retsuko laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s fine! As long as it\u2019s from you, I am perfectly okay with it. Besides, I think this oughta look good on me, huh?\u201d \u201cWell, obviously it would, given it would be worn by you.\u201d Haida replied, with a wink. \u201cMhmhm! &hellip;plus, if it makes you feel any better, Haida&hellip;I was at that store to get your present too.\u201d She similarly looked slightly embarrassed at saying that, as she handed him&hellip;a coffee mug. \u201cYou remember that mug I accidentally broke in a fit of rage once?\u201d \u201cYeah?\u201d Haida answered. \u201cWell, I tried all day to find another one like it, and I was only able to find one at that store. It had an awful smudge on it, though, so I wrote on it with a red marker. He looked at the mug. Indeed, it was the \u201cNo. 1 Papa\u201d mug he had previously&hellip;except now he noticed the extra writing. </p><p>\u201c(and husband!)\u201d</p><p>Tears began to seep through, as he looked at Retsuko with the biggest smile he could possibly give. \u201cOh, thank you! I love it!,\u201d said Haida, as she looked at him in surprise. \u201cO-oh! No problem, Haida!\u201d How adorable, she doesn\u2019t know how much this really meant to him. Not just because of the circumstances that led them both to this point, and coming together this holiday season\u2026.but also because he really liked that mug, and was happy to have it again. As the three happily look over their presents, Retsuko looks over her phone, to check on notifications from Fenneko, when she noticed a particular app. \u201c&hellip;.you know, I haven\u2019t done an Instagram post in a while\u2026.wanna do some pics?\u201d She said with a small smirk. \u201c&hellip;.let\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>And so they did. Several photos were shot, both inside the Soba shop, with all three flexing their gifts, and the food, and some outside, with them running across the streets, posing in front of a giant Christmas tree, and Retsuko and Haida getting close, and kissing. Enough for some silly post with \u201cHanging with the family this Christmas!\u201d, or something along those lines. As such, they started walking home, with Retsuko typing out something. It was seemingly a long thing to write, Haida realized. \u201cHey, how long does it take to say \u2018Merry Christmas,\u2019 anyways?,\u201d he joked, causing some small laughter from the red panda. \u201cYou\u2019ll see what it actually says, soon enough.\u201d Later that night, as the two began falling asleep in their bed, she finally reached out for her phone, and posted those images. \u201c&hellip;what the&hellip;you just now got to posting those?\u201d Haida asked, just barely awake. \u201cMm-hmm. Check your phone, if you want to know why.\u201d Haida grabbed out his phone, and opened up the app. Indeed, he saw all the photos taken. Selfies, food pics, fun little night on the town, it was all enough for him to smile&hellip;but then, he saw what she had wrote.</p><p><i>\u201cA few years ago, I rejected a hyena I knew, named Haida, and told him I only saw him as a friend. Just earlier this year, we exchanged vows, and became husband and wife. And now, here we are, at this holiday season, with our happy toddler, as we continue onto the new year, creeping ever closer. But before that, Christmas is coming up. By the time you\u2019re reading this, it probably already has come. And with that, I want to say something that I\u2019ve been keeping in mind as of these past few years. If you know people, even ones like Haida, hold them close. Keep them near you. Believe it or not, you\u2019d be surprised how important those people can be to you. Maybe you won\u2019t be as lucky as I was. Maybe you\u2019ll find, at the end, you two are still just friends. But even that\u2019s fine! Who knows? Even then, those people may very well change your life in the best of ways. Haida, I love you! And I hope that this post, made on the very last minute of Christmas Eve, makes you smile tonight, and all throughout tomorrow. To everyone reading, Merry Christmas!\u201d</i></p><p>Indeed, it made him smile, and will all throughout tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Retsuko. Merry Christmas.\u201d</p><p><b>OH MY SWEET JESUS I AM ACTUALLY DONE AWONFJLFBNAOUJSNA</b></p><p><b>Yes, it\u2019s finally here!

These had to be the wrong price tags, right? All for some nice jewelry? No, they seemed to be correct, much to his horror, and disappointment. In all fairness, perhaps this was merely karma.</p><p>Haida, admittedly, was a touch late. It was already Christmas Eve, and he hadn\u2019t gotten anything for Retsuko, or Ikari. He had been so busy and stressed out with work, that he didn\u2019t even have the idea of Christmas gifts dance around in his head until just today. As if a sudden 100 ton piled onto his back, which already had a bunch of anvils on it. But whatever, he was out shopping, might as well get it over with. He went through the mall like a hawk, trying to find good sales. He had to fight to get the latest paycheck, so he wanted to make sure he wasn\u2019t breaking the bank account today. But at the same time\u2026it was for his wife! And his son! He wanted to make it something special. They were special to him, so it made sense. So, something super important and awesome for them, and cheap enough so they can still pay the bills.</p><p>WOULD BE WONDERFUL TO FIND ONE OF THOSE, WOULDN\u2019T IT?!</p><p>But no! Everything is marked up like it\u2019s an auction! He had to get away, before his sanity was gone. He ran off, and found himself back outside. The snow, and the lights practically blinded him. He was so confused. So petrified. Christmas\u2026.wasn\u2019t always the greatest for him. It had been some time since what happened at the hospital, and the stuff that followed that Christmas, but the memory, even with all the wonderful ones that followed, is still burned into his memory. And now it plans to be even worse, with Ikari now here. Ugh, why couldn\u2019t this happen without him?! \u2026..wait, how could he even think that?! Aagh! Haida ran everywhere he could. Toy stores, make-up stores, everywhere\u2026they were all closing down. \u201cNo\u2026no, NO! COME ON!\u201d Haida exclaimed, as he saw time running out for him. \u201cNo, PLEASE! SOMEBODY! \u2026anyone?!\u201d At the end, he only saw one shop left.</p><p>A secondhand store.</p><p>He shuddered. The mere embarrassment. Retsuko, a practical angel in his eyes, who deserves nothing less than ROYALTY\u2026and here he was, buying some junk that was passed down by someone who wanted a quick buck. <i>\u201cDisgusting,\u201d</i> he thought, as he went inside. <i>\u201cYou should be ashamed of yourself. You are making a mockery out of her! What kind of man are you?!\u201d</i> But what choice did he have? Just go in, find some moderately nice stuff, and run out. That\u2019s all. Dignity be damned. He wandered the aisles, looking for something to stand out to him. What would a girl like Retsuko like? He\u2019s been with her for years now. Just a few months ago, he married her! And yet, somehow, when it comes to finding a good gift for her, he could never put two and two together, for some reason. He knows her from front to back, but here he was. Whatever. It\u2019s guessing time.</p><p>He browsed shelves up and down. It was actually impressive how much stuff you can find in one of these stores. Old video games, clothing, appliances, DVDs, toys\u2026and yet, nothing that could potentially entice a late-20s red panda\u2026.actually, wait, he thought, what\u2019s this? He saw, in the jewelry section, a very, VERY pretty necklace. Which, alone, is not that interesting. But he looked closer, and saw\u2026it was a rock necklace. Like, not that it was made of rock, it just had that aesthetic to it. Guitars, amps, skulls, the devil horns gesture, the works. And in it all were some lovely diamonds embedded in them. Somehow, he had a gut feeling. <i>\u201cShe\u2019s going to like this.\u201d</i> He grabbed the necklace, noticed it was 11,000 yen. Honestly? Not bad. That will do. He put it in his basket. \u201cNow, to find a toy for Ikari.\u201d What would a 2-year old be into? Probably just a blanket, still, or-</p><p>Wait.</p><p>Is that, Retsuko?</p><p>Certainly looks like her. She\u2019s just browsing the store, looking through the racks upon racks. What was she doing here? Does she know Haida was there? Is it a hallucination, to emphasize how much Haida failed by going to this store? Oh, crap! She turned towards him! He backed away, before she could notice. <i>\u201cPhew! That was a close one,\u201d</i> he thought to himself, as he suddenly eyed something. He walked closer towards what appeared to be a stuffed animal. A dinosaur, to be exact. Obviously this was own by some child at some point, as it appears one of the eyes is missing. Still, there was kind of a charm about it. Haida couldn\u2019t quite explain it, but it appealed to him in some capacity. He wondered about Ikari. Could he like it? <i>\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like he\u2019ll really notice it\u2019s worn out right now. He\u2019s 2.\u201d</i> Haida thought. So, he grabbed it. Now to pay for the stuff, and get out, before Retsuko notices him.</p><p>Walking out of that store felt weird. He accomplished what he set out to do\u2026.and yet, it still felt like something was unfinished. Come to think of it, it felt that way for every Christmas, for the past few years now. What was it? It was odd, whatever it was. Being with Retsuko managed to improve Haida\u2019s life in every capacity\u2026except for the alleged most wonderful time of the year. For some bizarre reason, every Christmas so far has been happy, and joyous, yes! But also\u2026.empty. Incomplete. What was it? Oh, well. Probably best to head home\u2026..perhaps it was the gifts themselves? Like, they WERE, in the end, last minute gifts. It\u2019s not like he put much thought into getting them. Perhaps that was the problem? \u2026but wait, last year, he and Retsuko paid to go see some show that evening! It was fun, they had good laughs, a beautiful night! And yet\u2026.it still felt off. Whatever it was, it was beginning to bug Haida. What was it?! WHAT?!</p><p>*bzzt bzzt*</p><p>A text. From Retsuko. He opened it up, to see what she wrote. \u201cHey, Haida! I was wondering, could you meet me and Ikari up at that soba shop in town? I think you know the one I\u2019m referring to. At least, I HOPE you do. ;)\u201d \u2026huh. Yeah, he could actually remember which one she was talking about. Why did she want to meet there? Is that where some party is going on? \u201cHmm\u2026.alright, I guess I won\u2019t question it.\u201d He uttered, as he began making his way there.</p><p>Through the door, he could see the wife and child, bundled up in adorable little jackets ordering soba. He smiled, although truthfully, he was worried about his gifts to them. Will they like them? Will they hate them? Only one way to find out. He entered, and saw Retsuko turn to him. \u201cHoney!\u201d She exclaimed, with a bright smile on her face. He could only blush at her precious gaze. \u201cH-hey, Retsuko! Hi, Ikari!\u201d <i>\u201cChrist, I\u2019m still like before we ever went out.\u201d</i> He thought to himself, as he continued. \u201cS-so, what\u2019s up? What are we doing here?\u201d She simply giggled. \u201cI just figured it would be a bit of a special place for us. I already ordered you a bowl, just so you know.\u201d Retsuko answered. \u201cSpecial place? The hell is she talking about?\u201d Not like it mattered, as the bowls were set out, ready to be eaten. Haida scarfed his down rather quickly. Being so frantic to find a good gift meant he effectively starved himself throughout the whole day. \u201cAh, that hit the spot!\u201d He sighed out in relief, as he turned to see his wife give a tiny bit to Ikari\u2026who promptly squirmed at the mere taste. \u201cYucky!\u201d The child exclaimed, causing the parents to laugh. \u201cOh, you\u2019ll get used to it, buddy,\u201d said Retsuko, sighing, and looking\u2026.sad? She wasn\u2019t sobbing, or anything, but Haida noticed, she didn\u2019t quite have the glow she usually does. What\u2026what was wrong?</p><p>\u201c\u2026Retsuko?\u201d Haida asked, concerned. \u201cHmm? Yes, sweetie?\u201d She turned to him, possibly trying to hide those hurt emotions. To no avail, alas. \u201cAre you okay? You look down.\u201d Retsuko only stared at him in shock. He clearly noticed. \u201c\u2026um..y-y-yeah! Yeah. A-okay.\u201d \u201c\u2026..Retsuko, you\u2019re lying. What\u2019s the matter? You can tell me.\u201d He got closer to her, seeing her worn face looking down. \u201c\u2026.promise you won\u2019t laugh. It\u2019s not funny to me.\u201d She muttered, as he holds her hand. \u201cI promise.\u201d He replied, in the most earnest voice she possibly ever heard him speak in. She looked, and stared deep into his eyes. He had a look of worry, as if the world could suddenly disappear, at any moment. She sighed, and spoke.</p><p>\u201cI get really sad around Christmas, these past few years. About what happened at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026huh?\u201d Haida looked even more confused than before. \u201cI\u2026sigh, even explaining it is weird! Okay, remember when you poured your heart out to me, at the hospital, when you got sick?\u201d \u201cI do\u2026I recall you saying you didn\u2019t want to pursue a relationship then. Honestly, made sense, given you had just had that break-up, probably should\u2019ve thought abou-\u201d She stopped him. \u201cWell\u2026I heard you got pretty depressed after that\u2026\u201d It had been some time since that event, so Haida had to think about it a bit. How long, 5 years ago? \u2026wow, had it actually been that long already? \u201c\u2026.yeah, I was pretty bummed.\u201d He suddenly answered. \u201cI\u2026also found out that Christmas was especially hard on you, since\u2026well, that was when I was going through that social media nonsense.\u201d \u201cI mean, I saw a picture you took with two fake wine glasses, implying you were with some dude, so yeah, that kinda put me in a bit of a funk, so\u2026\u201d He joked, but he saw she was still upset. \u201c\u2026erm, sorry, Retsuko.\u201d \u201cIt was fine. At the time, all of that kind of just blew past me. Even our chat towards the end, which was very lovely at the time. And was a great indicator of things to come, I might add. But some time later, after we had started dating, Fenneko told me about all of it. It was just a silly drunken thing, I\u2019m assuming to her\u2026but I couldn\u2019t get the images out of my brain. These thoughts of you in tears, drinking away your pain\u2026all because of my own ignorance, and my shooting you down\u2026there would be nights I would have horrible nightmares about that time, and I would wake up with tears streaming down my face. And even after we became much closer, even after Ikari was born, even now, as we\u2019re married\u2026..that feeling, of dread, of sorrow, of regret\u2026they still hover above me.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, Haida\u2019s heart plummeted. This was someone he loved, deeply! Someone he knew as being a beacon of light in a dark dystopia such as the Japanese work environment! Obviously, he knew she wasn\u2019t always going to be happy (she DID get mad a lot), but the fact that she said all of this, that his own pitiful reactions to her decisions all those years back now haunt her? Especially around one of the happiest times of the year! She shouldn\u2019t be so depressed around this time! Oh, god, how did he never notice?! Was\u2026was this the emptiness he was noticing? Was this the nagging feeling he had creeping around him? \u201cRetsuko\u2026,\u201d he was only able to let out, feeling like a broken man after hearing this. \u201c\u2026I-I picked this place, because\u2026well, it was a great place to remind me, Christmas\u2026it\u2019s not some fancy dinner, or some big social thing you have to do, in order to be loved\u2026it\u2019s something you spend with your family. Your friends. People you care about, people who care about you\u2026.people you love,\u201d she continued, caressing his hand. \u201c\u2026still, even if that were the case, it doesn\u2019t change how much guilt I have for putting you through all of that. If I could, I would go back, and jump onto you in that hospital bed, saying yes until I couldn\u2019t speak anymore. Maybe all of this would\u2019ve happened sooner, if I did that, and you wouldn\u2019t have had such a bad Christmas then\u2026.I\u2019m sorry, Haida, I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t want to hear any of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026.actually, Retsuko? Far from it. That\u2019s exactly what I needed to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?,\u201d she questioned, looking at the hyena, smiling warmly at her. \u201cFirstly, you\u2019re right. Christmas isn\u2019t some big thing you have to pull all the stops for. It\u2019s something you need to spend with the people around you, who care for you. Something I probably should\u2019ve remembered earlier today, honestly.\u201d He looked away, slightly embarassed. \u201cOh, right, when you were at the secondhand store? I saw.\u201d Retsuko winked, making Haida beet red. \u201cTHAT BEING SAID\u2026secondly\u2026.you know, maybe if you had said yes at the hospital, things would have happened sooner\u2026.but by that same token\u2026.they may not have happened at all. We don\u2019t know what would\u2019ve happened to us. The fact is it happened, and now we\u2019re at this point in our lives. Even back at that time, I just considered that moment \u2018ancient history\u2019, and just tried to move on, occasionally trying again\u2026to little avail, sure, but it was something. And yet, look where all of that got us to. We\u2019re now married. We have a son. We\u2019re living pretty alright, right now. And we got friends and families that have our backs, no matter what\u2026.what I\u2019m saying is, if given the chance to change the events of that day, I wouldn\u2019t change a single second. If it meant being in the same home with you, being able to help you put Ikari to bed, helping you deal with all the bullshit at work, hearing you scream your head off, if it means being able to wake up to you, in my arms, desperately trying to get up for work, and us saying that we love each other, if it means all of that\u2026\u2026I\u2019m willing to take the heartbreak of that day a hundred times over.\u201d</p><p>The shop went silent.</p><p>\u201cH-Haida\u2026\u201d Retsuko uttered, before jumping him, and giving him a long, tight embrace. Haida was taken aback slightly, before holding her closely as well. Ikari gently walked towards them, and joined in the hug. \u201c\u2026isn\u2019t Christmas wonderful, Haida?,\u201d asked Retsuko. \u201cIt is\u2026.speaking of, probably should get the gifts out of the way, huh?\u201d They break the hug, as Haida grabs out his presents to them. \u201cP-please understand, I was rushing, I only got around to getting these today\u2026\u201d He held out the gifts, the necklace to Retsuko, and the dinosaur to Ikari, wincing away. Retsuko was the first to react, a gasp coming from her. \u201cOh, Haida, I love it! It\u2019s beautiful!\u201d She exclaimed, observing the necklace, and every detail on it. Ikari simply grabbed the dinosaur, and proceeded to hug it tightly. Haida only looked, a bit in shock. \u201c\u2026huh. I somehow wasn\u2019t expecting any of this. I guess I just thought\u2026well, it was you guys, I didn\u2019t want to seem like I was disappointing you,\u201d said Haida, with which Retsuko laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s fine! As long as it\u2019s from you, I am perfectly okay with it. Besides, I think this oughta look good on me, huh?\u201d \u201cWell, obviously it would, given it would be worn by you.\u201d Haida replied, with a wink. \u201cMhmhm! \u2026plus, if it makes you feel any better, Haida\u2026I was at that store to get your present too.\u201d She similarly looked slightly embarrassed at saying that, as she handed him\u2026a coffee mug. \u201cYou remember that mug I accidentally broke in a fit of rage once?\u201d \u201cYeah?\u201d Haida answered. \u201cWell, I tried all day to find another one like it, and I was only able to find one at that store. It had an awful smudge on it, though, so I wrote on it with a red marker. He looked at the mug. Indeed, it was the \u201cNo. 1 Papa\u201d mug he had previously\u2026except now he noticed the extra writing. </p><p>\u201c(and husband!)\u201d</p><p>Tears began to seep through, as he looked at Retsuko with the biggest smile he could possibly give. \u201cOh, thank you! I love it!,\u201d said Haida, as she looked at him in surprise. \u201cO-oh! No problem, Haida!\u201d How adorable, she doesn\u2019t know how much this really meant to him. Not just because of the circumstances that led them both to this point, and coming together this holiday season\u2026.but also because he really liked that mug, and was happy to have it again. As the three happily look over their presents, Retsuko looks over her phone, to check on notifications from Fenneko, when she noticed a particular app. \u201c\u2026.you know, I haven\u2019t done an Instagram post in a while\u2026.wanna do some pics?\u201d She said with a small smirk. \u201c\u2026.let\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>And so they did. Several photos were shot, both inside the Soba shop, with all three flexing their gifts, and the food, and some outside, with them running across the streets, posing in front of a giant Christmas tree, and Retsuko and Haida getting close, and kissing. Enough for some silly post with \u201cHanging with the family this Christmas!\u201d, or something along those lines. As such, they started walking home, with Retsuko typing out something. It was seemingly a long thing to write, Haida realized. \u201cHey, how long does it take to say \u2018Merry Christmas,\u2019 anyways?,\u201d he joked, causing some small laughter from the red panda. \u201cYou\u2019ll see what it actually says, soon enough.\u201d Later that night, as the two began falling asleep in their bed, she finally reached out for her phone, and posted those images. \u201c\u2026what the\u2026you just now got to posting those?\u201d Haida asked, just barely awake. \u201cMm-hmm. Check your phone, if you want to know why.\u201d Haida grabbed out his phone, and opened up the app. Indeed, he saw all the photos taken. Selfies, food pics, fun little night on the town, it was all enough for him to smile\u2026but then, he saw what she had wrote.</p><p><i>\u201cA few years ago, I rejected a hyena I knew, named Haida, and told him I only saw him as a friend. Just earlier this year, we exchanged vows, and became husband and wife. And now, here we are, at this holiday season, with our happy toddler, as we continue onto the new year, creeping ever closer. But before that, Christmas is coming up. By the time you\u2019re reading this, it probably already has come. And with that, I want to say something that I\u2019ve been keeping in mind as of these past few years. If you know people, even ones like Haida, hold them close. Keep them near you. Believe it or not, you\u2019d be surprised how important those people can be to you. Maybe you won\u2019t be as lucky as I was. Maybe you\u2019ll find, at the end, you two are still just friends. But even that\u2019s fine! Who knows? Even then, those people may very well change your life in the best of ways. Haida, I love you! And I hope that this post, made on the very last minute of Christmas Eve, makes you smile tonight, and all throughout tomorrow. To everyone reading, Merry Christmas!\u201d</i></p><p>Indeed, it made him smile, and will all throughout tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Retsuko. Merry Christmas.\u201d</p><p><b>OH MY SWEET JESUS I AM ACTUALLY DONE AWONFJLFBNAOUJSNA</b></p><p><b>Yes, it\u2019s finally here! Like I said, this was majorly impacted by the recent Christmas special (to where I actually changed the original name, Last Minute, to fit with the new direction), and as such, now, just an hour or two before Christmas eve (at least, in my time), here it is! \u2026almost fitting in a way, huh? Well, in any regard, Merry Christmas! Or Happy Hanukkah! Or Happy Kwanzaa! Or Happy Winter Solstice! Or Happy\u2026..Life Day? I dunno, you do you, I guess. :P</b></p></p>",

These had to be the wrong price tags, right? All for some nice jewelry? No, they seemed to be correct, much to his horror, and disappointment. In all fairness, perhaps this was merely karma.</p><p>Haida, admittedly, was a touch late. It was already Christmas Eve, and he hadn\u2019t gotten anything for Retsuko, or Ikari. He had been so busy and stressed out with work, that he didn\u2019t even have the idea of Christmas gifts dance around in his head until just today. As if a sudden 100 ton piled onto his back, which already had a bunch of anvils on it. But whatever, he was out shopping, might as well get it over with. He went through the mall like a hawk, trying to find good sales. He had to fight to get the latest paycheck, so he wanted to make sure he wasn\u2019t breaking the bank account today. But at the same time\u2026it was for his wife! And his son! He wanted to make it something special. They were special to him, so it made sense. So, something super important and awesome for them, and cheap enough so they can still pay the bills.</p><p>WOULD BE WONDERFUL TO FIND ONE OF THOSE, WOULDN\u2019T IT?!</p><p>But no! Everything is marked up like it\u2019s an auction! He had to get away, before his sanity was gone. He ran off, and found himself back outside. The snow, and the lights practically blinded him. He was so confused. So petrified. Christmas\u2026.wasn\u2019t always the greatest for him. It had been some time since what happened at the hospital, and the stuff that followed that Christmas, but the memory, even with all the wonderful ones that followed, is still burned into his memory. And now it plans to be even worse, with Ikari now here. Ugh, why couldn\u2019t this happen without him?! \u2026..wait, how could he even think that?! Aagh! Haida ran everywhere he could. Toy stores, make-up stores, everywhere\u2026they were all closing down. \u201cNo\u2026no, NO! COME ON!\u201d Haida exclaimed, as he saw time running out for him. \u201cNo, PLEASE! SOMEBODY! \u2026anyone?!\u201d At the end, he only saw one shop left.</p><p>A secondhand store.</p><p>He shuddered. The mere embarrassment. Retsuko, a practical angel in his eyes, who deserves nothing less than ROYALTY\u2026and here he was, buying some junk that was passed down by someone who wanted a quick buck. <i>\u201cDisgusting,\u201d</i> he thought, as he went inside. <i>\u201cYou should be ashamed of yourself. You are making a mockery out of her! What kind of man are you?!\u201d</i> But what choice did he have? Just go in, find some moderately nice stuff, and run out. That\u2019s all. Dignity be damned. He wandered the aisles, looking for something to stand out to him. What would a girl like Retsuko like? He\u2019s been with her for years now. Just a few months ago, he married her! And yet, somehow, when it comes to finding a good gift for her, he could never put two and two together, for some reason. He knows her from front to back, but here he was. Whatever. It\u2019s guessing time.</p><p>He browsed shelves up and down. It was actually impressive how much stuff you can find in one of these stores. Old video games, clothing, appliances, DVDs, toys\u2026and yet, nothing that could potentially entice a late-20s red panda\u2026.actually, wait, he thought, what\u2019s this? He saw, in the jewelry section, a very, VERY pretty necklace. Which, alone, is not that interesting. But he looked closer, and saw\u2026it was a rock necklace. Like, not that it was made of rock, it just had that aesthetic to it. Guitars, amps, skulls, the devil horns gesture, the works. And in it all were some lovely diamonds embedded in them. Somehow, he had a gut feeling. <i>\u201cShe\u2019s going to like this.\u201d</i> He grabbed the necklace, noticed it was 11,000 yen. Honestly? Not bad. That will do. He put it in his basket. \u201cNow, to find a toy for Ikari.\u201d What would a 2-year old be into? Probably just a blanket, still, or-</p><p>Wait.</p><p>Is that, Retsuko?</p><p>Certainly looks like her. She\u2019s just browsing the store, looking through the racks upon racks. What was she doing here? Does she know Haida was there? Is it a hallucination, to emphasize how much Haida failed by going to this store? Oh, crap! She turned towards him! He backed away, before she could notice. <i>\u201cPhew! That was a close one,\u201d</i> he thought to himself, as he suddenly eyed something. He walked closer towards what appeared to be a stuffed animal. A dinosaur, to be exact. Obviously this was own by some child at some point, as it appears one of the eyes is missing. Still, there was kind of a charm about it. Haida couldn\u2019t quite explain it, but it appealed to him in some capacity. He wondered about Ikari. Could he like it? <i>\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like he\u2019ll really notice it\u2019s worn out right now. He\u2019s 2.\u201d</i> Haida thought. So, he grabbed it. Now to pay for the stuff, and get out, before Retsuko notices him.</p><p>Walking out of that store felt weird. He accomplished what he set out to do\u2026.and yet, it still felt like something was unfinished. Come to think of it, it felt that way for every Christmas, for the past few years now. What was it? It was odd, whatever it was. Being with Retsuko managed to improve Haida\u2019s life in every capacity\u2026except for the alleged most wonderful time of the year. For some bizarre reason, every Christmas so far has been happy, and joyous, yes! But also\u2026.empty. Incomplete. What was it? Oh, well. Probably best to head home\u2026..perhaps it was the gifts themselves? Like, they WERE, in the end, last minute gifts. It\u2019s not like he put much thought into getting them. Perhaps that was the problem? \u2026but wait, last year, he and Retsuko paid to go see some show that evening! It was fun, they had good laughs, a beautiful night! And yet\u2026.it still felt off. Whatever it was, it was beginning to bug Haida. What was it?! WHAT?!</p><p>*bzzt bzzt*</p><p>A text. From Retsuko. He opened it up, to see what she wrote. \u201cHey, Haida! I was wondering, could you meet me and Ikari up at that soba shop in town? I think you know the one I\u2019m referring to. At least, I HOPE you do. ;)\u201d \u2026huh. Yeah, he could actually remember which one she was talking about. Why did she want to meet there? Is that where some party is going on? \u201cHmm\u2026.alright, I guess I won\u2019t question it.\u201d He uttered, as he began making his way there.</p><p>Through the door, he could see the wife and child, bundled up in adorable little jackets ordering soba. He smiled, although truthfully, he was worried about his gifts to them. Will they like them? Will they hate them? Only one way to find out. He entered, and saw Retsuko turn to him. \u201cHoney!\u201d She exclaimed, with a bright smile on her face. He could only blush at her precious gaze. \u201cH-hey, Retsuko! Hi, Ikari!\u201d <i>\u201cChrist, I\u2019m still like before we ever went out.\u201d</i> He thought to himself, as he continued. \u201cS-so, what\u2019s up? What are we doing here?\u201d She simply giggled. \u201cI just figured it would be a bit of a special place for us. I already ordered you a bowl, just so you know.\u201d Retsuko answered. \u201cSpecial place? The hell is she talking about?\u201d Not like it mattered, as the bowls were set out, ready to be eaten. Haida scarfed his down rather quickly. Being so frantic to find a good gift meant he effectively starved himself throughout the whole day. \u201cAh, that hit the spot!\u201d He sighed out in relief, as he turned to see his wife give a tiny bit to Ikari\u2026who promptly squirmed at the mere taste. \u201cYucky!\u201d The child exclaimed, causing the parents to laugh. \u201cOh, you\u2019ll get used to it, buddy,\u201d said Retsuko, sighing, and looking\u2026.sad? She wasn\u2019t sobbing, or anything, but Haida noticed, she didn\u2019t quite have the glow she usually does. What\u2026what was wrong?</p><p>\u201c\u2026Retsuko?\u201d Haida asked, concerned. \u201cHmm? Yes, sweetie?\u201d She turned to him, possibly trying to hide those hurt emotions. To no avail, alas. \u201cAre you okay? You look down.\u201d Retsuko only stared at him in shock. He clearly noticed. \u201c\u2026um..y-y-yeah! Yeah. A-okay.\u201d \u201c\u2026..Retsuko, you\u2019re lying. What\u2019s the matter? You can tell me.\u201d He got closer to her, seeing her worn face looking down. \u201c\u2026.promise you won\u2019t laugh. It\u2019s not funny to me.\u201d She muttered, as he holds her hand. \u201cI promise.\u201d He replied, in the most earnest voice she possibly ever heard him speak in. She looked, and stared deep into his eyes. He had a look of worry, as if the world could suddenly disappear, at any moment. She sighed, and spoke.</p><p>\u201cI get really sad around Christmas, these past few years. About what happened at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026huh?\u201d Haida looked even more confused than before. \u201cI\u2026sigh, even explaining it is weird! Okay, remember when you poured your heart out to me, at the hospital, when you got sick?\u201d \u201cI do\u2026I recall you saying you didn\u2019t want to pursue a relationship then. Honestly, made sense, given you had just had that break-up, probably should\u2019ve thought abou-\u201d She stopped him. \u201cWell\u2026I heard you got pretty depressed after that\u2026\u201d It had been some time since that event, so Haida had to think about it a bit. How long, 5 years ago? \u2026wow, had it actually been that long already? \u201c\u2026.yeah, I was pretty bummed.\u201d He suddenly answered. \u201cI\u2026also found out that Christmas was especially hard on you, since\u2026well, that was when I was going through that social media nonsense.\u201d \u201cI mean, I saw a picture you took with two fake wine glasses, implying you were with some dude, so yeah, that kinda put me in a bit of a funk, so\u2026\u201d He joked, but he saw she was still upset. \u201c\u2026erm, sorry, Retsuko.\u201d \u201cIt was fine. At the time, all of that kind of just blew past me. Even our chat towards the end, which was very lovely at the time. And was a great indicator of things to come, I might add. But some time later, after we had started dating, Fenneko told me about all of it. It was just a silly drunken thing, I\u2019m assuming to her\u2026but I couldn\u2019t get the images out of my brain. These thoughts of you in tears, drinking away your pain\u2026all because of my own ignorance, and my shooting you down\u2026there would be nights I would have horrible nightmares about that time, and I would wake up with tears streaming down my face. And even after we became much closer, even after Ikari was born, even now, as we\u2019re married\u2026..that feeling, of dread, of sorrow, of regret\u2026they still hover above me.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, Haida\u2019s heart plummeted. This was someone he loved, deeply! Someone he knew as being a beacon of light in a dark dystopia such as the Japanese work environment! Obviously, he knew she wasn\u2019t always going to be happy (she DID get mad a lot), but the fact that she said all of this, that his own pitiful reactions to her decisions all those years back now haunt her? Especially around one of the happiest times of the year! She shouldn\u2019t be so depressed around this time! Oh, god, how did he never notice?! Was\u2026was this the emptiness he was noticing? Was this the nagging feeling he had creeping around him? \u201cRetsuko\u2026,\u201d he was only able to let out, feeling like a broken man after hearing this. \u201c\u2026I-I picked this place, because\u2026well, it was a great place to remind me, Christmas\u2026it\u2019s not some fancy dinner, or some big social thing you have to do, in order to be loved\u2026it\u2019s something you spend with your family. Your friends. People you care about, people who care about you\u2026.people you love,\u201d she continued, caressing his hand. \u201c\u2026still, even if that were the case, it doesn\u2019t change how much guilt I have for putting you through all of that. If I could, I would go back, and jump onto you in that hospital bed, saying yes until I couldn\u2019t speak anymore. Maybe all of this would\u2019ve happened sooner, if I did that, and you wouldn\u2019t have had such a bad Christmas then\u2026.I\u2019m sorry, Haida, I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t want to hear any of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026.actually, Retsuko? Far from it. That\u2019s exactly what I needed to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?,\u201d she questioned, looking at the hyena, smiling warmly at her. \u201cFirstly, you\u2019re right. Christmas isn\u2019t some big thing you have to pull all the stops for. It\u2019s something you need to spend with the people around you, who care for you. Something I probably should\u2019ve remembered earlier today, honestly.\u201d He looked away, slightly embarassed. \u201cOh, right, when you were at the secondhand store? I saw.\u201d Retsuko winked, making Haida beet red. \u201cTHAT BEING SAID\u2026secondly\u2026.you know, maybe if you had said yes at the hospital, things would have happened sooner\u2026.but by that same token\u2026.they may not have happened at all. We don\u2019t know what would\u2019ve happened to us. The fact is it happened, and now we\u2019re at this point in our lives. Even back at that time, I just considered that moment \u2018ancient history\u2019, and just tried to move on, occasionally trying again\u2026to little avail, sure, but it was something. And yet, look where all of that got us to. We\u2019re now married. We have a son. We\u2019re living pretty alright, right now. And we got friends and families that have our backs, no matter what\u2026.what I\u2019m saying is, if given the chance to change the events of that day, I wouldn\u2019t change a single second. If it meant being in the same home with you, being able to help you put Ikari to bed, helping you deal with all the bullshit at work, hearing you scream your head off, if it means being able to wake up to you, in my arms, desperately trying to get up for work, and us saying that we love each other, if it means all of that\u2026\u2026I\u2019m willing to take the heartbreak of that day a hundred times over.\u201d</p><p>The shop went silent.</p><p>\u201cH-Haida\u2026\u201d Retsuko uttered, before jumping him, and giving him a long, tight embrace. Haida was taken aback slightly, before holding her closely as well. Ikari gently walked towards them, and joined in the hug. \u201c\u2026isn\u2019t Christmas wonderful, Haida?,\u201d asked Retsuko. \u201cIt is\u2026.speaking of, probably should get the gifts out of the way, huh?\u201d They break the hug, as Haida grabs out his presents to them. \u201cP-please understand, I was rushing, I only got around to getting these today\u2026\u201d He held out the gifts, the necklace to Retsuko, and the dinosaur to Ikari, wincing away. Retsuko was the first to react, a gasp coming from her. \u201cOh, Haida, I love it! It\u2019s beautiful!\u201d She exclaimed, observing the necklace, and every detail on it. Ikari simply grabbed the dinosaur, and proceeded to hug it tightly. Haida only looked, a bit in shock. \u201c\u2026huh. I somehow wasn\u2019t expecting any of this. I guess I just thought\u2026well, it was you guys, I didn\u2019t want to seem like I was disappointing you,\u201d said Haida, with which Retsuko laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s fine! As long as it\u2019s from you, I am perfectly okay with it. Besides, I think this oughta look good on me, huh?\u201d \u201cWell, obviously it would, given it would be worn by you.\u201d Haida replied, with a wink. \u201cMhmhm! \u2026plus, if it makes you feel any better, Haida\u2026I was at that store to get your present too.\u201d She similarly looked slightly embarrassed at saying that, as she handed him\u2026a coffee mug. \u201cYou remember that mug I accidentally broke in a fit of rage once?\u201d \u201cYeah?\u201d Haida answered. \u201cWell, I tried all day to find another one like it, and I was only able to find one at that store. It had an awful smudge on it, though, so I wrote on it with a red marker. He looked at the mug. Indeed, it was the \u201cNo. 1 Papa\u201d mug he had previously\u2026except now he noticed the extra writing. </p><p>\u201c(and husband!)\u201d</p><p>Tears began to seep through, as he looked at Retsuko with the biggest smile he could possibly give. \u201cOh, thank you! I love it!,\u201d said Haida, as she looked at him in surprise. \u201cO-oh! No problem, Haida!\u201d How adorable, she doesn\u2019t know how much this really meant to him. Not just because of the circumstances that led them both to this point, and coming together this holiday season\u2026.but also because he really liked that mug, and was happy to have it again. As the three happily look over their presents, Retsuko looks over her phone, to check on notifications from Fenneko, when she noticed a particular app. \u201c\u2026.you know, I haven\u2019t done an Instagram post in a while\u2026.wanna do some pics?\u201d She said with a small smirk. \u201c\u2026.let\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>And so they did. Several photos were shot, both inside the Soba shop, with all three flexing their gifts, and the food, and some outside, with them running across the streets, posing in front of a giant Christmas tree, and Retsuko and Haida getting close, and kissing. Enough for some silly post with \u201cHanging with the family this Christmas!\u201d, or something along those lines. As such, they started walking home, with Retsuko typing out something. It was seemingly a long thing to write, Haida realized. \u201cHey, how long does it take to say \u2018Merry Christmas,\u2019 anyways?,\u201d he joked, causing some small laughter from the red panda. \u201cYou\u2019ll see what it actually says, soon enough.\u201d Later that night, as the two began falling asleep in their bed, she finally reached out for her phone, and posted those images. \u201c\u2026what the\u2026you just now got to posting those?\u201d Haida asked, just barely awake. \u201cMm-hmm. Check your phone, if you want to know why.\u201d Haida grabbed out his phone, and opened up the app. Indeed, he saw all the photos taken. Selfies, food pics, fun little night on the town, it was all enough for him to smile\u2026but then, he saw what she had wrote.</p><p><i>\u201cA few years ago, I rejected a hyena I knew, named Haida, and told him I only saw him as a friend. Just earlier this year, we exchanged vows, and became husband and wife. And now, here we are, at this holiday season, with our happy toddler, as we continue onto the new year, creeping ever closer. But before that, Christmas is coming up. By the time you\u2019re reading this, it probably already has come. And with that, I want to say something that I\u2019ve been keeping in mind as of these past few years. If you know people, even ones like Haida, hold them close. Keep them near you. Believe it or not, you\u2019d be surprised how important those people can be to you. Maybe you won\u2019t be as lucky as I was. Maybe you\u2019ll find, at the end, you two are still just friends. But even that\u2019s fine! Who knows? Even then, those people may very well change your life in the best of ways. Haida, I love you! And I hope that this post, made on the very last minute of Christmas Eve, makes you smile tonight, and all throughout tomorrow. To everyone reading, Merry Christmas!\u201d</i></p><p>Indeed, it made him smile, and will all throughout tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Retsuko.

These had to be the wrong price tags, right? All for some nice jewelry? No, they seemed to be correct, much to his horror, and disappointment. In all fairness, perhaps this was merely karma.</p><p>Haida, admittedly, was a touch late. It was already Christmas Eve, and he hadn&rsquo;t gotten anything for Retsuko, or Ikari. He had been so busy and stressed out with work, that he didn&rsquo;t even have the idea of Christmas gifts dance around in his head until just today. As if a sudden 100 ton piled onto his back, which already had a bunch of anvils on it. But whatever, he was out shopping, might as well get it over with. He went through the mall like a hawk, trying to find good sales. He had to fight to get the latest paycheck, so he wanted to make sure he wasn&rsquo;t breaking the bank account today. But at the same time&hellip;it was for his wife! And his son! He wanted to make it something special. They were special to him, so it made sense. So, something super important and awesome for them, and cheap enough so they can still pay the bills.</p><p>WOULD BE WONDERFUL TO FIND ONE OF THOSE, WOULDN&rsquo;T IT?!</p><p>But no! Everything is marked up like it&rsquo;s an auction! He had to get away, before his sanity was gone. He ran off, and found himself back outside. The snow, and the lights practically blinded him. He was so confused. So petrified. Christmas&hellip;.wasn&rsquo;t always the greatest for him. It had been some time since what happened at the hospital, and the stuff that followed that Christmas, but the memory, even with all the wonderful ones that followed, is still burned into his memory. And now it plans to be even worse, with Ikari now here. Ugh, why couldn&rsquo;t this happen without him?! &hellip;..wait, how could he even think that?! Aagh! Haida ran everywhere he could. Toy stores, make-up stores, everywhere&hellip;they were all closing down. &ldquo;No&hellip;no, NO! COME ON!&rdquo; Haida exclaimed, as he saw time running out for him. &ldquo;No, PLEASE! SOMEBODY! &hellip;anyone?!&rdquo; At the end, he only saw one shop left.</p><p>A secondhand store.</p><p>He shuddered. The mere embarrassment. Retsuko, a practical angel in his eyes, who deserves nothing less than ROYALTY&hellip;and here he was, buying some junk that was passed down by someone who wanted a quick buck. <i>&ldquo;Disgusting,&rdquo;</i> he thought, as he went inside. <i>&ldquo;You should be ashamed of yourself. You are making a mockery out of her! What kind of man are you?!&rdquo;</i> But what choice did he have? Just go in, find some moderately nice stuff, and run out. That&rsquo;s all. Dignity be damned. He wandered the aisles, looking for something to stand out to him. What would a girl like Retsuko like? He&rsquo;s been with her for years now. Just a few months ago, he married her! And yet, somehow, when it comes to finding a good gift for her, he could never put two and two together, for some reason. He knows her from front to back, but here he was. Whatever. It&rsquo;s guessing time.</p><p>He browsed shelves up and down. It was actually impressive how much stuff you can find in one of these stores. Old video games, clothing, appliances, DVDs, toys&hellip;and yet, nothing that could potentially entice a late-20s red panda&hellip;.actually, wait, he thought, what&rsquo;s this? He saw, in the jewelry section, a very, VERY pretty necklace. Which, alone, is not that interesting. But he looked closer, and saw&hellip;it was a rock necklace. Like, not that it was made of rock, it just had that aesthetic to it. Guitars, amps, skulls, the devil horns gesture, the works. And in it all were some lovely diamonds embedded in them. Somehow, he had a gut feeling. <i>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s going to like this.&rdquo;</i> He grabbed the necklace, noticed it was 11,000 yen. Honestly? Not bad. That will do. He put it in his basket. &ldquo;Now, to find a toy for Ikari.&rdquo; What would a 2-year old be into? Probably just a blanket, still, or-</p><p>Wait.</p><p>Is that, Retsuko?</p><p>Certainly looks like her. She&rsquo;s just browsing the store, looking through the racks upon racks. What was she doing here? Does she know Haida was there? Is it a hallucination, to emphasize how much Haida failed by going to this store? Oh, crap! She turned towards him! He backed away, before she could notice. <i>&ldquo;Phew! That was a close one,&rdquo;</i> he thought to himself, as he suddenly eyed something. He walked closer towards what appeared to be a stuffed animal. A dinosaur, to be exact. Obviously this was own by some child at some point, as it appears one of the eyes is missing. Still, there was kind of a charm about it. Haida couldn&rsquo;t quite explain it, but it appealed to him in some capacity. He wondered about Ikari. Could he like it? <i>&ldquo;I mean, it&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;ll really notice it&rsquo;s worn out right now. He&rsquo;s 2.&rdquo;</i> Haida thought. So, he grabbed it. Now to pay for the stuff, and get out, before Retsuko notices him.</p><p>Walking out of that store felt weird. He accomplished what he set out to do&hellip;.and yet, it still felt like something was unfinished. Come to think of it, it felt that way for every Christmas, for the past few years now. What was it? It was odd, whatever it was. Being with Retsuko managed to improve Haida&rsquo;s life in every capacity&hellip;except for the alleged most wonderful time of the year. For some bizarre reason, every Christmas so far has been happy, and joyous, yes! But also&hellip;.empty. Incomplete. What was it? Oh, well. Probably best to head home&hellip;..perhaps it was the gifts themselves? Like, they WERE, in the end, last minute gifts. It&rsquo;s not like he put much thought into getting them. Perhaps that was the problem? &hellip;but wait, last year, he and Retsuko paid to go see some show that evening! It was fun, they had good laughs, a beautiful night! And yet&hellip;.it still felt off. Whatever it was, it was beginning to bug Haida. What was it?! WHAT?!</p><p>*bzzt bzzt*</p><p>A text. From Retsuko. He opened it up, to see what she wrote. &ldquo;Hey, Haida! I was wondering, could you meet me and Ikari up at that soba shop in town? I think you know the one I&rsquo;m referring to. At least, I HOPE you do. ;)&rdquo; &hellip;huh. Yeah, he could actually remember which one she was talking about. Why did she want to meet there? Is that where some party is going on? &ldquo;Hmm&hellip;.alright, I guess I won&rsquo;t question it.&rdquo; He uttered, as he began making his way there.</p><p>Through the door, he could see the wife and child, bundled up in adorable little jackets ordering soba. He smiled, although truthfully, he was worried about his gifts to them. Will they like them? Will they hate them? Only one way to find out. He entered, and saw Retsuko turn to him. &ldquo;Honey!&rdquo; She exclaimed, with a bright smile on her face. He could only blush at her precious gaze. &ldquo;H-hey, Retsuko! Hi, Ikari!&rdquo; <i>&ldquo;Christ, I&rsquo;m still like before we ever went out.&rdquo;</i> He thought to himself, as he continued. &ldquo;S-so, what&rsquo;s up? What are we doing here?&rdquo; She simply giggled. &ldquo;I just figured it would be a bit of a special place for us. I already ordered you a bowl, just so you know.&rdquo; Retsuko answered. &ldquo;Special place? The hell is she talking about?&rdquo; Not like it mattered, as the bowls were set out, ready to be eaten. Haida scarfed his down rather quickly. Being so frantic to find a good gift meant he effectively starved himself throughout the whole day. &ldquo;Ah, that hit the spot!&rdquo; He sighed out in relief, as he turned to see his wife give a tiny bit to Ikari&hellip;who promptly squirmed at the mere taste. &ldquo;Yucky!&rdquo; The child exclaimed, causing the parents to laugh. &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll get used to it, buddy,&rdquo; said Retsuko, sighing, and looking&hellip;.sad? She wasn&rsquo;t sobbing, or anything, but Haida noticed, she didn&rsquo;t quite have the glow she usually does. What&hellip;what was wrong?</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;Retsuko?&rdquo; Haida asked, concerned. &ldquo;Hmm? Yes, sweetie?&rdquo; She turned to him, possibly trying to hide those hurt emotions. To no avail, alas. &ldquo;Are you okay? You look down.&rdquo; Retsuko only stared at him in shock. He clearly noticed. &ldquo;&hellip;um..y-y-yeah! Yeah. A-okay.&rdquo; &ldquo;&hellip;..Retsuko, you&rsquo;re lying. What&rsquo;s the matter? You can tell me.&rdquo; He got closer to her, seeing her worn face looking down. &ldquo;&hellip;.promise you won&rsquo;t laugh. It&rsquo;s not funny to me.&rdquo; She muttered, as he holds her hand. &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo; He replied, in the most earnest voice she possibly ever heard him speak in. She looked, and stared deep into his eyes. He had a look of worry, as if the world could suddenly disappear, at any moment. She sighed, and spoke.</p><p>&ldquo;I get really sad around Christmas, these past few years. About what happened at the hospital.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;huh?&rdquo; Haida looked even more confused than before. &ldquo;I&hellip;sigh, even explaining it is weird! Okay, remember when you poured your heart out to me, at the hospital, when you got sick?&rdquo; &ldquo;I do&hellip;I recall you saying you didn&rsquo;t want to pursue a relationship then. Honestly, made sense, given you had just had that break-up, probably should&rsquo;ve thought abou-&rdquo; She stopped him. &ldquo;Well&hellip;I heard you got pretty depressed after that&hellip;&rdquo; It had been some time since that event, so Haida had to think about it a bit. How long, 5 years ago? &hellip;wow, had it actually been that long already? &ldquo;&hellip;.yeah, I was pretty bummed.&rdquo; He suddenly answered. &ldquo;I&hellip;also found out that Christmas was especially hard on you, since&hellip;well, that was when I was going through that social media nonsense.&rdquo; &ldquo;I mean, I saw a picture you took with two fake wine glasses, implying you were with some dude, so yeah, that kinda put me in a bit of a funk, so&hellip;&rdquo; He joked, but he saw she was still upset. &ldquo;&hellip;erm, sorry, Retsuko.&rdquo; &ldquo;It was fine. At the time, all of that kind of just blew past me. Even our chat towards the end, which was very lovely at the time. And was a great indicator of things to come, I might add. But some time later, after we had started dating, Fenneko told me about all of it. It was just a silly drunken thing, I&rsquo;m assuming to her&hellip;but I couldn&rsquo;t get the images out of my brain. These thoughts of you in tears, drinking away your pain&hellip;all because of my own ignorance, and my shooting you down&hellip;there would be nights I would have horrible nightmares about that time, and I would wake up with tears streaming down my face. And even after we became much closer, even after Ikari was born, even now, as we&rsquo;re married&hellip;..that feeling, of dread, of sorrow, of regret&hellip;they still hover above me.&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment, Haida&rsquo;s heart plummeted. This was someone he loved, deeply! Someone he knew as being a beacon of light in a dark dystopia such as the Japanese work environment! Obviously, he knew she wasn&rsquo;t always going to be happy (she DID get mad a lot), but the fact that she said all of this, that his own pitiful reactions to her decisions all those years back now haunt her? Especially around one of the happiest times of the year! She shouldn&rsquo;t be so depressed around this time! Oh, god, how did he never notice?! Was&hellip;was this the emptiness he was noticing? Was this the nagging feeling he had creeping around him? &ldquo;Retsuko&hellip;,&rdquo; he was only able to let out, feeling like a broken man after hearing this. &ldquo;&hellip;I-I picked this place, because&hellip;well, it was a great place to remind me, Christmas&hellip;it&rsquo;s not some fancy dinner, or some big social thing you have to do, in order to be loved&hellip;it&rsquo;s something you spend with your family. Your friends. People you care about, people who care about you&hellip;.people you love,&rdquo; she continued, caressing his hand. &ldquo;&hellip;still, even if that were the case, it doesn&rsquo;t change how much guilt I have for putting you through all of that. If I could, I would go back, and jump onto you in that hospital bed, saying yes until I couldn&rsquo;t speak anymore. Maybe all of this would&rsquo;ve happened sooner, if I did that, and you wouldn&rsquo;t have had such a bad Christmas then&hellip;.I&rsquo;m sorry, Haida, I&rsquo;m sure you didn&rsquo;t want to hear any of that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;.actually, Retsuko? Far from it. That&rsquo;s exactly what I needed to hear.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh?,&rdquo; she questioned, looking at the hyena, smiling warmly at her. &ldquo;Firstly, you&rsquo;re right. Christmas isn&rsquo;t some big thing you have to pull all the stops for. It&rsquo;s something you need to spend with the people around you, who care for you. Something I probably should&rsquo;ve remembered earlier today, honestly.&rdquo; He looked away, slightly embarassed. &ldquo;Oh, right, when you were at the secondhand store? I saw.&rdquo; Retsuko winked, making Haida beet red. &ldquo;THAT BEING SAID&hellip;secondly&hellip;.you know, maybe if you had said yes at the hospital, things would have happened sooner&hellip;.but by that same token&hellip;.they may not have happened at all. We don&rsquo;t know what would&rsquo;ve happened to us. The fact is it happened, and now we&rsquo;re at this point in our lives. Even back at that time, I just considered that moment &lsquo;ancient history&rsquo;, and just tried to move on, occasionally trying again&hellip;to little avail, sure, but it was something. And yet, look where all of that got us to. We&rsquo;re now married. We have a son. We&rsquo;re living pretty alright, right now. And we got friends and families that have our backs, no matter what&hellip;.what I&rsquo;m saying is, if given the chance to change the events of that day, I wouldn&rsquo;t change a single second. If it meant being in the same home with you, being able to help you put Ikari to bed, helping you deal with all the bullshit at work, hearing you scream your head off, if it means being able to wake up to you, in my arms, desperately trying to get up for work, and us saying that we love each other, if it means all of that&hellip;&hellip;I&rsquo;m willing to take the heartbreak of that day a hundred times over.&rdquo;</p><p>The shop went silent.</p><p>&ldquo;H-Haida&hellip;&rdquo; Retsuko uttered, before jumping him, and giving him a long, tight embrace. Haida was taken aback slightly, before holding her closely as well. Ikari gently walked towards them, and joined in the hug. &ldquo;&hellip;isn&rsquo;t Christmas wonderful, Haida?,&rdquo; asked Retsuko. &ldquo;It is&hellip;.speaking of, probably should get the gifts out of the way, huh?&rdquo; They break the hug, as Haida grabs out his presents to them. &ldquo;P-please understand, I was rushing, I only got around to getting these today&hellip;&rdquo; He held out the gifts, the necklace to Retsuko, and the dinosaur to Ikari, wincing away. Retsuko was the first to react, a gasp coming from her. &ldquo;Oh, Haida, I love it! It&rsquo;s beautiful!&rdquo; She exclaimed, observing the necklace, and every detail on it. Ikari simply grabbed the dinosaur, and proceeded to hug it tightly. Haida only looked, a bit in shock. &ldquo;&hellip;huh. I somehow wasn&rsquo;t expecting any of this. I guess I just thought&hellip;well, it was you guys, I didn&rsquo;t want to seem like I was disappointing you,&rdquo; said Haida, with which Retsuko laughed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine! As long as it&rsquo;s from you, I am perfectly okay with it. Besides, I think this oughta look good on me, huh?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, obviously it would, given it would be worn by you.&rdquo; Haida replied, with a wink. &ldquo;Mhmhm! &hellip;plus, if it makes you feel any better, Haida&hellip;I was at that store to get your present too.&rdquo; She similarly looked slightly embarrassed at saying that, as she handed him&hellip;a coffee mug. &ldquo;You remember that mug I accidentally broke in a fit of rage once?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Haida answered. &ldquo;Well, I tried all day to find another one like it, and I was only able to find one at that store. It had an awful smudge on it, though, so I wrote on it with a red marker. He looked at the mug. Indeed, it was the &ldquo;No. 1 Papa&rdquo; mug he had previously&hellip;except now he noticed the extra writing. </p><p>&ldquo;(and husband!)&rdquo;</p><p>Tears began to seep through, as he looked at Retsuko with the biggest smile he could possibly give. &ldquo;Oh, thank you! I love it!,&rdquo; said Haida, as she looked at him in surprise. &ldquo;O-oh! No problem, Haida!&rdquo; How adorable, she doesn&rsquo;t know how much this really meant to him. Not just because of the circumstances that led them both to this point, and coming together this holiday season&hellip;.but also because he really liked that mug, and was happy to have it again. As the three happily look over their presents, Retsuko looks over her phone, to check on notifications from Fenneko, when she noticed a particular app. &ldquo;&hellip;.you know, I haven&rsquo;t done an Instagram post in a while&hellip;.wanna do some pics?&rdquo; She said with a small smirk. &ldquo;&hellip;.let&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>And so they did. Several photos were shot, both inside the Soba shop, with all three flexing their gifts, and the food, and some outside, with them running across the streets, posing in front of a giant Christmas tree, and Retsuko and Haida getting close, and kissing.
