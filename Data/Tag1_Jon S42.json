                "content": "<p>So based on what&rsquo;s happened in GOT season 8, I can see George&rsquo;s line of thinking for his final two novels. He&rsquo;s gone on record saying that he wants to go against what the audience is expecting in the story. So that&rsquo;s why the honorable Ned Stark who was set up as the main hero gets axed off in the first novel. Then his eldest son, who you think will avenge his father&rsquo;s death, gets betrayed and killed before he even reaches King&rsquo;s Landing. </p><p>The season has been controversial but I can see why certain choices were made. The first three episodes (most likely the plot of Winds of Winter) ends with the White Walkers getting wiped out. Once again, there&rsquo;s a fantasy trope being subverted. The evil army of mythical creatures is defeated before the final novel.

We should have seen some more down right bad Dany. More importantly I dont think it makes any sense that she would kill everyone when she wants to be a ruler. A ruler of what? I&rsquo;m confused. If Cersei didnt ring the bell and then she did all that it would have made sense because she wants the throne and would do anything to get it.

        "body": "<h1>Jon Snow and the Vicious Cycle</h1><p>All right, so enough and more has been written about Jon&rsquo;s passivity, irrelevance and apparent stupidity this season. And for the most part, it&rsquo;s justified. This season is a travesty of a nature rarely seen before in any popular media in it&rsquo;s almost complete and utter destruction of every character or story arc or myth. None of these characters are recognizable, and are barely likeable. But even amidst this muck, and despite knowing that his character has been butchered, fans still find Jon to be an easy target for their anger. </p><p>I keep coming across the narrative that Jon &lsquo;betrayed&rsquo; Dany, and that he lied about loving her and that he&rsquo;s a shit lover for not giving her anything in return for everything she gave him for 'his&rsquo; war. And this is such a confounding sentiment that I barely know how to start unpacking this. </p><p>Firstly, HIS war? The fact that D&amp;D decided in their unfathomable wisdom to convert the Great War into a skirmish similar to a feud between houses doesn&rsquo;t negate the fact that it was always meant to be the final and greatest confrontation. It wasn&rsquo;t Jon&rsquo;s war. Did Jaime ride North for Jon&rsquo;s war or to fight for the living? Painting the Great War as similar to the BoB which had the promise of a reward at the end of it not only insults Jon&rsquo;s whole arc but also Dany&rsquo;s visionary ability to see beyond her needs to what is the true threat. </p><p>Secondly, he gave her nothing? Again, this leads into the first point. Dany went beyond the Wall to save him, but saw the reality of the AoTD. It&rsquo;s that which spurred her to offer all her help in the Great War, not the fact that she loved him and wanted to give him everything she had to make him happy. And Jon did give her something - he gave her the most valuable thing he owned - his sovereignty. Bluntly put, Dany had far, far greater resources than he did. If she gave him her armies and her dragons, he gave her his crown. </p><p>I don&rsquo;t want to get too deep into S8 since even thinking of that piece of literary and scripting arson makes me want to pull my hair out. However, to make my point about the vicious cycle I must wade into the muck. </p><p>Jon is someone who&rsquo;s forever been fighting against identities placed on his shoulders by those around him. He&rsquo;s grown up being 'Ned Stark&rsquo;s shame&rsquo;, the Bastard of Winterfell. For the longest time Jon Snow existed not as an individual, but as a negative symbol of someone else&rsquo;s failing. His status as a bastard has been his cross to bear since he was born. And by the time he&rsquo;s chosen to be KiTN, he&rsquo;s finally begun to stitch his identity of Ned Stark&rsquo;s bastard alongside Ned Stark&rsquo;s son. In his mind he will never be a Stark, but he CAN be Ned&rsquo;s son. And that&rsquo;s what gives him peace.</p><p>And it&rsquo;s this singular positive sense of identity which is shattered with Sam&rsquo;s revelation. His reaction, which is coincidentally one of the few times Jon has actually been IC this season, hones in on the fact that his father LIED to him. The source of his faith in himself is poisoned. He doesn&rsquo;t immediately focus on the fact that he&rsquo;s a Targaryen, what he does grasp though is that he&rsquo;s NOT Ned&rsquo;s son. And for someone who&rsquo;s been told time and again in his most formative years that being a bastard means he&rsquo;s never truly going to be part of Ned Stark&rsquo;s family, such a shock will not be easy to process. </p><p>In the second episode it was pushed into our faces that Jon was avoiding Dany. What we missed out on was that he was avoiding EVERYONE. By the time he opened up to Dany in the crypts, he&rsquo;s been to speak to Bran who already knows. Who&rsquo;s the first one Jon himself tells? It&rsquo;s Dany. And he tells her because he trusts her, because he doesn&rsquo;t want her to labour under a false impression of her brother and mostly because he WANTS to tell her. He hopes for her help in making sense of this since he can&rsquo;t, not by himself. </p><p>But he doesn&rsquo;t get that support. Instead he&rsquo;s hit straight with a political curveball. Even when Sam brought it up he barely considered it in his shock. And when he tells Dany it&rsquo;s damn clear that he didn&rsquo;t expect her first immediate reaction to be that he&rsquo;s now a threat to her throne. </p><p>Post the Battle of Winterfell, when she seeks him out, their conversation again makes it clear that they HAVE spoken about his parentage and it once again centered around claims for the throne. At this point Jon is floundering - he is in love with her but he also knows he&rsquo;s related to her and he can&rsquo;t figure that out until the mess in his head is sorted. Cue the almost make-out. He can&rsquo;t go through with it and Dany tells him that she is HAPPY when she forgets who he actually is. How is Jon going to sort out his own tangle of emotions when Dany straight out tells him that she herself can&rsquo;t stop thinking about his claim? </p><p>I know most Dany fans feel that he betrayed her by letting his sisters know. But here&rsquo;s the thing - the truth of his blood affects NOONE more than it affects him. And I&rsquo;ve seen people claim that Dany has known Jon only for months - she should never have given him so much so soon. But by that same logic, he&rsquo;s known her for the same amount of time as well. Why would he alleviate her fears of being supplanted by choosing her desire for secrecy over letting his family know? Sansa decides to betray his trust - that&rsquo;s all on Sansa. Jon decided to trust her and he did. He doesn&rsquo;t know how close she came to usurping him under LF&rsquo;s manipulation. More than him needing to tell them because of 'honour&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s a hope that perhaps his family can help him deal with this revelation since he and Dany are clearly looking at the same issue with completely different lenses.</p><p>However, since it was never deemed important for the audience to know what the reactions Sansa and Arya were to the news, all we have are guesses. Jon and Arya&rsquo;s relationship was one of the first casualties of the season - otherwise Arya of all people would immediately have known what Jon was struggling with. She wouldn&rsquo;t have made a speech about the last of the Starks and then ten minutes later traipse off never to return. So now Jon has this huge secret which has upended his life and he hasn&rsquo;t handled it. He hasn&rsquo;t received the kind of support or understanding he needed either from Dany or Arya or Sansa. He already knows Dany can&rsquo;t look beyond the claim of his blood while he&rsquo;s supposed to shrug and get over his own reservations. Incest may not be a big deal to Dany, but it IS to Jon. The claim in his blood may not be a big deal to Jon but it IS to Dany. And both of these statements are absurd since neither of the characters we know and love would think or act this way. Dany not being elated about there being another Targaryen? Jon being somewhat afraid of her? </p><p>And this is the mindset with which he comes upon Dany at Dragonstone. Varys accosts him and he realises that Sansa&rsquo;s betrayed him. Dany burns Varys and he&rsquo;s - ok at this point I don&rsquo;t know what Jon is thinking. This is where it all breaks down and I do agree that the Jon we know would NEVER have left Dany alone. But then again, please admit that the Dany we know would also never have zeroed in on his blood claim with such intensity. Jon kept reaffirming that she&rsquo;s his queen because she kept focusing on his claim. He&rsquo;s a bad lover for not being able to give her the undivided attention and love she needs? Then how is she any better a lover for making a life-changing secret about him mostly about her?</p><p>Here&rsquo;s where the vicious cycle comes in. Jon can&rsquo;t escape his birth either. His birth will always define him - either as someone&rsquo;s shame or as someone&rsquo;s pawn. He&rsquo;s led most of his life being less a person and more a symbol of lust and dishonor. His bastard blood has always preceded his character, no matter what he did or how hard he tried to rise above. And now post revelation - his identity is still tied to his blood. To Dany he&rsquo;s a potential threat, to Sansa he&rsquo;s a potential opportunity. </p><p>But who is Aegon Targaryen to Jon Snow? </p>",

More than him needing to tell them because of 'honour\u2019, it\u2019s a hope that perhaps his family can help him deal with this revelation since he and Dany are clearly looking at the same issue with completely different lenses.</p><p>However, since it was never deemed important for the audience to know what the reactions Sansa and Arya were to the news, all we have are guesses. Jon and Arya\u2019s relationship was one of the first casualties of the season - otherwise Arya of all people would immediately have known what Jon was struggling with. She wouldn\u2019t have made a speech about the last of the Starks and then ten minutes later traipse off never to return. So now Jon has this huge secret which has upended his life and he hasn\u2019t handled it. He hasn\u2019t received the kind of support or understanding he needed either from Dany or Arya or Sansa. He already knows Dany can\u2019t look beyond the claim of his blood while he\u2019s supposed to shrug and get over his own reservations. Incest may not be a big deal to Dany, but it IS to Jon. The claim in his blood may not be a big deal to Jon but it IS to Dany. And both of these statements are absurd since neither of the characters we know and love would think or act this way. Dany not being elated about there being another Targaryen? Jon being somewhat afraid of her? </p><p>And this is the mindset with which he comes upon Dany at Dragonstone. Varys accosts him and he realises that Sansa\u2019s betrayed him. Dany burns Varys and he\u2019s - ok at this point I don\u2019t know what Jon is thinking. This is where it all breaks down and I do agree that the Jon we know would NEVER have left Dany alone. But then again, please admit that the Dany we know would also never have zeroed in on his blood claim with such intensity. Jon kept reaffirming that she\u2019s his queen because she kept focusing on his claim. He\u2019s a bad lover for not being able to give her the undivided attention and love she needs? Then how is she any better a lover for making a life-changing secret about him mostly about her?</p><p>Here\u2019s where the vicious cycle comes in. Jon can\u2019t escape his birth either. His birth will always define him - either as someone\u2019s shame or as someone\u2019s pawn. He\u2019s led most of his life being less a person and more a symbol of lust and dishonor. His bastard blood has always preceded his character, no matter what he did or how hard he tried to rise above. And now post revelation - his identity is still tied to his blood. To Dany he\u2019s a potential threat, to Sansa he\u2019s a potential opportunity. </p><p>But who is Aegon Targaryen to Jon Snow? </p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>Jon Snow and the Vicious Cycle</h1><p>All right, so enough and more has been written about Jon&rsquo;s passivity, irrelevance and apparent stupidity this season. And for the most part, it&rsquo;s justified. This season is a travesty of a nature rarely seen before in any popular media in it&rsquo;s almost complete and utter destruction of every character or story arc or myth. None of these characters are recognizable, and are barely likeable. But even amidst this muck, and despite knowing that his character has been butchered, fans still find Jon to be an easy target for their anger. </p><p>I keep coming across the narrative that Jon &lsquo;betrayed&rsquo; Dany, and that he lied about loving her and that he&rsquo;s a shit lover for not giving her anything in return for everything she gave him for 'his&rsquo; war. And this is such a confounding sentiment that I barely know how to start unpacking this. </p><p>Firstly, HIS war? The fact that D&amp;D decided in their unfathomable wisdom to convert the Great War into a skirmish similar to a feud between houses doesn&rsquo;t negate the fact that it was always meant to be the final and greatest confrontation. It wasn&rsquo;t Jon&rsquo;s war. Did Jaime ride North for Jon&rsquo;s war or to fight for the living? Painting the Great War as similar to the BoB which had the promise of a reward at the end of it not only insults Jon&rsquo;s whole arc but also Dany&rsquo;s visionary ability to see beyond her needs to what is the true threat. </p><p>Secondly, he gave her nothing? Again, this leads into the first point. Dany went beyond the Wall to save him, but saw the reality of the AoTD. It&rsquo;s that which spurred her to offer all her help in the Great War, not the fact that she loved him and wanted to give him everything she had to make him happy. And Jon did give her something - he gave her the most valuable thing he owned - his sovereignty. Bluntly put, Dany had far, far greater resources than he did. If she gave him her armies and her dragons, he gave her his crown. </p><p>I don&rsquo;t want to get too deep into S8 since even thinking of that piece of literary and scripting arson makes me want to pull my hair out. However, to make my point about the vicious cycle I must wade into the muck. </p><p>Jon is someone who&rsquo;s forever been fighting against identities placed on his shoulders by those around him. He&rsquo;s grown up being 'Ned Stark&rsquo;s shame&rsquo;, the Bastard of Winterfell. For the longest time Jon Snow existed not as an individual, but as a negative symbol of someone else&rsquo;s failing. His status as a bastard has been his cross to bear since he was born. And by the time he&rsquo;s chosen to be KiTN, he&rsquo;s finally begun to stitch his identity of Ned Stark&rsquo;s bastard alongside Ned Stark&rsquo;s son. In his mind he will never be a Stark, but he CAN be Ned&rsquo;s son. And that&rsquo;s what gives him peace.</p><p>And it&rsquo;s this singular positive sense of identity which is shattered with Sam&rsquo;s revelation. His reaction, which is coincidentally one of the few times Jon has actually been IC this season, hones in on the fact that his father LIED to him. The source of his faith in himself is poisoned. He doesn&rsquo;t immediately focus on the fact that he&rsquo;s a Targaryen, what he does grasp though is that he&rsquo;s NOT Ned&rsquo;s son. And for someone who&rsquo;s been told time and again in his most formative years that being a bastard means he&rsquo;s never truly going to be part of Ned Stark&rsquo;s family, such a shock will not be easy to process. </p><p>In the second episode it was pushed into our faces that Jon was avoiding Dany. What we missed out on was that he was avoiding EVERYONE. By the time he opened up to Dany in the crypts, he&rsquo;s been to speak to Bran who already knows. Who&rsquo;s the first one Jon himself tells? It&rsquo;s Dany. And he tells her because he trusts her, because he doesn&rsquo;t want her to labour under a false impression of her brother and mostly because he WANTS to tell her. He hopes for her help in making sense of this since he can&rsquo;t, not by himself. </p><p>But he doesn&rsquo;t get that support. Instead he&rsquo;s hit straight with a political curveball. Even when Sam brought it up he barely considered it in his shock. And when he tells Dany it&rsquo;s damn clear that he didn&rsquo;t expect her first immediate reaction to be that he&rsquo;s now a threat to her throne. </p><p>Post the Battle of Winterfell, when she seeks him out, their conversation again makes it clear that they HAVE spoken about his parentage and it once again centered around claims for the throne. At this point Jon is floundering - he is in love with her but he also knows he&rsquo;s related to her and he can&rsquo;t figure that out until the mess in his head is sorted. Cue the almost make-out. He can&rsquo;t go through with it and Dany tells him that she is HAPPY when she forgets who he actually is. How is Jon going to sort out his own tangle of emotions when Dany straight out tells him that she herself can&rsquo;t stop thinking about his claim? </p><p>I know most Dany fans feel that he betrayed her by letting his sisters know. But here&rsquo;s the thing - the truth of his blood affects NOONE more than it affects him. And I&rsquo;ve seen people claim that Dany has known Jon only for months - she should never have given him so much so soon. But by that same logic, he&rsquo;s known her for the same amount of time as well. Why would he alleviate her fears of being supplanted by choosing her desire for secrecy over letting his family know? Sansa decides to betray his trust - that&rsquo;s all on Sansa. Jon decided to trust her and he did. He doesn&rsquo;t know how close she came to usurping him under LF&rsquo;s manipulation. More than him needing to tell them because of 'honour&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s a hope that perhaps his family can help him deal with this revelation since he and Dany are clearly looking at the same issue with completely different lenses.</p><p>However, since it was never deemed important for the audience to know what the reactions Sansa and Arya were to the news, all we have are guesses. Jon and Arya&rsquo;s relationship was one of the first casualties of the season - otherwise Arya of all people would immediately have known what Jon was struggling with. She wouldn&rsquo;t have made a speech about the last of the Starks and then ten minutes later traipse off never to return. So now Jon has this huge secret which has upended his life and he hasn&rsquo;t handled it. He hasn&rsquo;t received the kind of support or understanding he needed either from Dany or Arya or Sansa. He already knows Dany can&rsquo;t look beyond the claim of his blood while he&rsquo;s supposed to shrug and get over his own reservations. Incest may not be a big deal to Dany, but it IS to Jon. The claim in his blood may not be a big deal to Jon but it IS to Dany. And both of these statements are absurd since neither of the characters we know and love would think or act this way. Dany not being elated about there being another Targaryen? Jon being somewhat afraid of her? </p><p>And this is the mindset with which he comes upon Dany at Dragonstone. Varys accosts him and he realises that Sansa&rsquo;s betrayed him. Dany burns Varys and he&rsquo;s - ok at this point I don&rsquo;t know what Jon is thinking. This is where it all breaks down and I do agree that the Jon we know would NEVER have left Dany alone. But then again, please admit that the Dany we know would also never have zeroed in on his blood claim with such intensity.
