She makes a choice in regards to Everett and hopes she doesn&rsquo;t regret it.\n\n</p><p><b>Warnings: Explicit Language, Suggested Smut, Angst</b></p><!-- more --><p>For the next four years, Captain Marvel and I hopped from planet to planet fighting skrulls. We mostly bounced between Earth and her home, but occasionally we made a side stop based on any intel she received from people she trusted. Since half of our battles were fought on another planet, only my control on fire, lightning, and wind remained with me. But my inability to heal from heavy hits is what caused us to return to Earth as often as we did. </p><p>We learned a great deal from each other. She found it fascinating to see how the Earth healed me in different ways depending on my level of injuries. I was baffled at how she was able to harness the power of a white hole to use in battle. Carol told me about the Kree Empire, the work that Ronan was doing to secure their future, and how she was found on Earth after an accident which lead her to meeting Fury and Coulson. And in return, I tried my best to explain mutants and the X-Gene.</p><p>&ldquo;But if you all have the same gene that causes mutation, why is each mutation different?&rdquo; We were exiting her ship after we landed at the military base back in California.</p><p>&ldquo;Honestly? You should probably talk to Dr McCoy about that. I&rsquo;m sure it has something to do with alleles, or something on that level.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re unsure?&rdquo; Carol glanced in my direction as we walked down the halls to the barracks.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, a majority of my knowledge on biology was gained during the 1500s, so needless to say there are some holes in my education. I&rsquo;ve done my best to self-teach myself the ways that science and technology has changed, but mostly I&rsquo;ve had to rely on Charles and Hank to fill in the gaps.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do the others know how old you are?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fury has an idea that I&rsquo;m older than I appear. What number he&rsquo;s guessing at, I haven&rsquo;t a clue. As for Coulson and Ross, no. And I&rsquo;d like to keep it that way.&rdquo;</p><p>She stopped and grabbed my arm. &ldquo;Ross doesn&rsquo;t know? I thought you and he were&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Friends. He and I are friends.&rdquo; But I couldn&rsquo;t look at her in the eyes as I said it. In truth, I had really missed Everett while I was traveling around the galaxy. And the more I thought about him, the more I realized I had made a mistake by telling him no.</p><p>Carol sighed and let go of my arm. &ldquo;Somehow I&rsquo;m not entirely convinced by that. Why don&rsquo;t you go find him? We&rsquo;re not scheduled to leave again for a couple of months.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have a sinking feeling I&rsquo;m too late.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why? Has he mentioned anything the last time you were here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just that he felt he never saw me enough.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s time to make up for lost time.&rdquo; She shoved me in the direction of the men&rsquo;s barracks before heading down a different hall.</p><p>I shook my head before continuing down the path she had pointed me towards. Taking a deep breath, I knocked quickly on his door. His eyes grew wide as he took in the site of me.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re back!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yup. Danvers says we&rsquo;ll be here for a few months this time so I thought I&rsquo;d check up on my favorite pilot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll glad you&rsquo;ll finally be here for a while. I feel like we never get to talk as much.&rdquo; His eyes subconsciously went up and down my body, sending a feeling deep into my stomach.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, I&rsquo;m so sorry. Can I come in? I&rsquo;ve really missed you.&rdquo;</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t think it was possible for his eyes to get any wider. &ldquo;You did?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course. Like I said, you mean a lot to me, Ev.&rdquo;</p><p>He licked his lips as he stared at me, like he couldn&rsquo;t believe I was really there. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been so long since anyone has called me that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Would you prefer Everett?&rdquo; I took a tentative step towards him.</p><p>&ldquo;Not a chance.&rdquo; Before I could say anything else, he pulled me in roughly for a kiss. I wrapped my arms around him and followed him inside, kicking the door closed behind us.</p><p>That night we laid in his small bed, my head on his chest. The sound of his heartbeat was calming after all those quiet nights on the ship. I decided to break the silence. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to leave with Carol this next time.&rdquo;</p><p>I could hear the smile in his voice. &ldquo;Part of me wants to believe it&rsquo;s because of tonight, but I know you better than that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t lie and say this didn&rsquo;t help push me towards that decision. But in all honesty, I&rsquo;m not meant for space travel.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it like out there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Eerily quiet and massively expansive. Really makes you feel small and it&rsquo;s a bit unsettling. But it&rsquo;s also amazingly beautiful at times.&rdquo;</p><p>He trailed his fingers over my arm that was draped over his chest. &ldquo;So&hellip;um,&rdquo; he cleared his throat, &ldquo;what made you change your mind about us?&rdquo;</p><p>I let out a long sigh. &ldquo;This last trip&hellip;. it almost went horribly wrong. I managed to remain unharmed, but it was a big wake up call that my power is here on Earth and I can&rsquo;t take it with me. Before all this I was helping my old friend Charles start a school to help our kind and I still want to help. And I very well can&rsquo;t do that if I&rsquo;m dead because some skrull decided they had enough of me. It also made me realize how alone I have been these past twenty years. You&rsquo;re not the man I lost and I&rsquo;m glad for that. You&rsquo;re someone who will combat my darker side, not feed it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have a darker side.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Everyone has a darker side, Ev. Some are just darker than others. I&rsquo;m not ready to talk about my past yet, but I do want to see if we can make this work.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve known each other for five years now without me knowing your past. I think I can wait a little longer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>The next month felt like I was home again, which was an odd concept for me. I was not the kind to feel comfortable around military and government people, but yet here I was trying to date a pilot while forming bonds with Fury, Coulson, and Danvers. Danvers seemed to take it in stride that I didn&rsquo;t want to return with her this last time, but that didn&rsquo;t stop her from subtly trying to change my mind every day at lunch. Fury (who now sported an eye patch thanks to the injury he received at the beginning of this war) was glad that I had decided to stick around the base, even if it mostly was because of Everett. He felt this war was far from over and wanted me close by when shit hit the fan.</p><p>And as it happens with my life, that&rsquo;s exactly what happened. </p><p>It started with Everett. I went to visit him one night and he looked deathly pale when he opened the door. &ldquo;Oh my god, Everett! Are you alright?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m just running a fever is all.&rdquo;</p><p>I looked at his pupils and something began to buzz in the back of my mind. Like a memory long since buried. &ldquo;Just a fever?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I have felt dizzy as well as dehydrated. But I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s just the flu.&rdquo;</p><p>My blood ran cold. &ldquo;We should get you to the hospital wing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be fi-&rdquo; But before he could finish, he passed out on his feet. Luckily, I was close enough to catch him before he could hit the ground. I scooped him into my arms and ran out the door and down the hall.</p><p>I passed both Fury and Coulson on my way who immediately raced after me without waiting for an explanation. In the hospital wing, Fury began to bark orders as I laid Everett down on a stretcher. &ldquo;Damnit, Ev. Wake up.&rdquo;</p><p>The doctors wheeled him away as Fury and Coulson turned towards me. &ldquo;What the hell happened?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I went to see him today and he looked like death warmed over. I started asking him what was wrong when he passed out! Thank the gods I was close enough to catch him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did he tell you anything?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just stuff that made it sound like he had the flu. But his pupils&hellip;. they were really small.&rdquo;</p><p>Fury studied my face. &ldquo;I take it you&rsquo;ve seen this before?&rdquo;</p><p>I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. &ldquo;Yes, but it&rsquo;s been so many years I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m remembering it correctly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So what could it be?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Me. It&rsquo;s my mutation, or at least part of it.&rdquo; I ran my hand through my hair. &ldquo;Part of me was worried this could happen, but since it hadn&rsquo;t happened in-&rdquo; I caught myself before I could reveal an idea of my age, &ldquo;in many years, I wasn&rsquo;t a hundred percent sure it could still happen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is happening?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My mutation is killing him. I can&rsquo;t explain it beyond that because I genuinely don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve actually been working with some friends to find out the reason why.&rdquo; I buried my face in my hands for a moment before looking back at the two gentlemen. &ldquo;I need to leave before this gets worse. If I leave now, there&rsquo;s a chance Everett can survive this.&rdquo;</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just going to abandon him?!\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to respond, but Fury\u2019s boss suddenly burst into the room.</p><p>\u201cYou two,\u201d he gestured at Fury and myself, \u201cwith me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes sir. Coulson, stay here with Ross and report to me once they get a diagnosis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, sir.\u201d</p><p>Before I had a chance to protest, Fury grabbed me by the arm and dragged me after his boss. We sped down several hallways before we finally came to his office. I couldn&rsquo;t understand why he wanted to speak to me. I knew so little about this man, I didn&rsquo;t even know his name. And as far as I knew, Coulson and Fury told him I was someone with the Canadian government when I brought that first skrull to this base.</p><p>The man went behind his desk, but remained standing. &ldquo;Nick, I&rsquo;ve worked with you for many years and I&rsquo;ve always thought you were a great agent.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Until now. We&rsquo;re caught in the middle of an intergalactic war and your hiding a mutant right here on base?!&rdquo;</p><p>My head snapped up as Fury fumbled to explain the situation. &ldquo;Sir, it&rsquo;s not what you think. Miss _____ has been helping us fight the skrulls.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A mutant that you allowed near one of our pilots! And now he&rsquo;s dying because no doubt he contracted whatever those creatures carry!&rdquo;</p><p>My eyes narrowed at this. &ldquo;How do you know about Captain Ross being ill?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me?! You dare question me?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How the fuck do you know about Everett?! We literally carried him into the hospital five minutes before you walked into the door! And furthermore, how the fuck do you know about me?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your kind never was great at hiding!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the best at hiding, mother fucker! All time champion! Unless&hellip;.&rdquo; my voice trailed off as I caught a glint of green in his eyes. My jaw dropped and my eyes widened as the realization hit me. &ldquo;Holy fuck! You&rsquo;re-&rdquo;</p><p>But I was cut off by the man in question shooting me with a Taser gun. The prongs hit right at my heart and I could feel the currents flow through me. Harmlessly.</p><p>He scowled at the gun, smacking the side of it with his hand. &ldquo;Piece of shit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you just try to Tase her?!&rdquo; Fury&rsquo;s jaw was practically on the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a piece of shit, Talos.&rdquo; Both sets of eyes snapped to my face. &ldquo;The problem is you&rsquo;re trying to use it on a creature that&rsquo;s had lightning flow through her body on an almost daily basis since she was a child. This,&rdquo; I gestured at the prongs that still stuck out of my chest, &ldquo;is the equivalent of a human receiving a static shock. Now. Let me show you how this was supposed to go.&rdquo;</p><p>I grabbed the protruding wires with my hands, but didn&rsquo;t remove the prongs. My eyes and hair turned silvery blue as I summoned a lightning bolt. It burst through the window by his desk, hit my body, and traveled down the wires to Talos&rsquo; waiting hands. Talos was immediately shot back through the wall behind his desk, the Taser gun exploding from the force of energy. I grabbed Fury and shoved him down so the desk would protect him from the shooting plastic pieces.</p><p>&ldquo;WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fury, for fuck sake can you bring your voice down a few dozen notches. We need to get Danvers. Your boss is actually Talos, the head of the skrull army!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think he&rsquo;s dead?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Trust me, if skrulls were that easy to kill, I would have been home ages ago.&rdquo; I yanked the two prongs out of my chest and grabbed Fury by his jacket before racing down the hall. &ldquo;Marvel! We got a fucking emergency!!&rdquo;</p><p>Luck was on my side and Carol happened to be walking by at that very moment. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? Is that blood on your chest?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Forget about that! Talos is Fury&rsquo;s boss! I just blasted his ass through a wall, but you need to finish the job.&rdquo;</p><p>Without waiting any further, Carol raced towards the room we just left. I took a deep breath and headed back towards the hospital wing.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, aren&rsquo;t you going with her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, Fury. Carol can handle herself. I need&hellip;. I need to get&hellip;&rdquo; I closed my eyes and sighed. &ldquo;Home. I need to go home. I&rsquo;ve been here far too long.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re really going to do it. You&rsquo;re going to leave him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to, but I need to. I need him to live.&rdquo;</p><p>Fury nodded his head. &ldquo;I still think it&rsquo;s a big mistake, but after what I just saw you do to Talos, I&rsquo;m not going to fight you.&rdquo;</p><p>I gave him a small smile. &ldquo;Thanks, Fury. I&rsquo;m sure our paths will cross once again. Governments have a bad habit of sticking their nose where it doesn&rsquo;t belong.&rdquo;</p><p>He laughed. &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m sure they will.&rdquo;</p><p>Back in the hospital wing, I hid close by to Everett&rsquo;s room and listened to the doctor&rsquo;s diagnosis as he talked to Coulson.</p><p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t explain it. It&rsquo;s as if a foreign source is causing him to be ill. All we can do is wait.&rdquo;</p><p>My heart broke at the news. I was right; I was killing Everett. The moment the doctor and Coulson walked away from the room, I quietly slipped in. Everett was hooked up to a couple different machines to keep track of his vitals and to help him breath. A small sob left my lips. Seeing the doctor left behind his clipboard, I flipped to a blank page and began to quickly write a note for when Everett woke up. He would never forgive me, but hopefully this would help him understand. I folded up the piece of paper and tucked it under a glass of water on the nearby table with his name visible.</p><p>I bent down to whisper in his ear. &ldquo;Ev, I am so sorry it&rsquo;s come to this. I never wanted to leave you, but I can&rsquo;t stay and watch you die at my hands. I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>Kissing his cheek on last time, I snuck out the door and off the base.</p><p><a href=\"https://my-marvel-musings.tumblr.com/post/182224411233/broken-wings\">Chapter 14</a></p>",

And I very well can\u2019t do that if I\u2019m dead because some skrull decided they had enough of me. It also made me realize how alone I have been these past twenty years. You\u2019re not the man I lost and I\u2019m glad for that. You\u2019re someone who will combat my darker side, not feed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a darker side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone has a darker side, Ev. Some are just darker than others. I\u2019m not ready to talk about my past yet, but I do want to see if we can make this work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ve known each other for five years now without me knowing your past. I think I can wait a little longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The next month felt like I was home again, which was an odd concept for me. I was not the kind to feel comfortable around military and government people, but yet here I was trying to date a pilot while forming bonds with Fury, Coulson, and Danvers. Danvers seemed to take it in stride that I didn\u2019t want to return with her this last time, but that didn\u2019t stop her from subtly trying to change my mind every day at lunch. Fury (who now sported an eye patch thanks to the injury he received at the beginning of this war) was glad that I had decided to stick around the base, even if it mostly was because of Everett. He felt this war was far from over and wanted me close by when shit hit the fan.</p><p>And as it happens with my life, that\u2019s exactly what happened. </p><p>It started with Everett. I went to visit him one night and he looked deathly pale when he opened the door. \u201cOh my god, Everett! Are you alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m just running a fever is all.\u201d</p><p>I looked at his pupils and something began to buzz in the back of my mind. Like a memory long since buried. \u201cJust a fever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I have felt dizzy as well as dehydrated. But I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just the flu.\u201d</p><p>My blood ran cold. \u201cWe should get you to the hospital wing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fi-\u201d But before he could finish, he passed out on his feet. Luckily, I was close enough to catch him before he could hit the ground. I scooped him into my arms and ran out the door and down the hall.</p><p>I passed both Fury and Coulson on my way who immediately raced after me without waiting for an explanation. In the hospital wing, Fury began to bark orders as I laid Everett down on a stretcher. \u201cDamnit, Ev. Wake up.\u201d</p><p>The doctors wheeled him away as Fury and Coulson turned towards me. \u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to see him today and he looked like death warmed over. I started asking him what was wrong when he passed out! Thank the gods I was close enough to catch him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he tell you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust stuff that made it sound like he had the flu. But his pupils\u2026. they were really small.\u201d</p><p>Fury studied my face. \u201cI take it you\u2019ve seen this before?\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. \u201cYes, but it\u2019s been so many years I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m remembering it correctly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what could it be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe. It\u2019s my mutation, or at least part of it.\u201d I ran my hand through my hair. \u201cPart of me was worried this could happen, but since it hadn\u2019t happened in-\u201d I caught myself before I could reveal an idea of my age, \u201cin many years, I wasn\u2019t a hundred percent sure it could still happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mutation is killing him. I can\u2019t explain it beyond that because I genuinely don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve actually been working with some friends to find out the reason why.\u201d I buried my face in my hands for a moment before looking back at the two gentlemen. \u201cI need to leave before this gets worse. If I leave now, there\u2019s a chance Everett can survive this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just going to abandon him?!\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to respond, but Fury\u2019s boss suddenly burst into the room.</p><p>\u201cYou two,\u201d he gestured at Fury and myself, \u201cwith me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes sir. Coulson, stay here with Ross and report to me once they get a diagnosis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, sir.\u201d</p><p>Before I had a chance to protest, Fury grabbed me by the arm and dragged me after his boss. We sped down several hallways before we finally came to his office. I couldn\u2019t understand why he wanted to speak to me. I knew so little about this man, I didn\u2019t even know his name. And as far as I knew, Coulson and Fury told him I was someone with the Canadian government when I brought that first skrull to this base.</p><p>The man went behind his desk, but remained standing. \u201cNick, I\u2019ve worked with you for many years and I\u2019ve always thought you were a great agent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil now. We\u2019re caught in the middle of an intergalactic war and your hiding a mutant right here on base?!\u201d</p><p>My head snapped up as Fury fumbled to explain the situation. \u201cSir, it\u2019s not what you think. Miss _____ has been helping us fight the skrulls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mutant that you allowed near one of our pilots! And now he\u2019s dying because no doubt he contracted whatever those creatures carry!\u201d</p><p>My eyes narrowed at this. \u201cHow do you know about Captain Ross being ill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?! You dare question me?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the fuck do you know about Everett?! We literally carried him into the hospital five minutes before you walked into the door! And furthermore, how the fuck do you know about me?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour kind never was great at hiding!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the best at hiding, mother fucker! All time champion! Unless\u2026.\u201d my voice trailed off as I caught a glint of green in his eyes. My jaw dropped and my eyes widened as the realization hit me. \u201cHoly fuck! You\u2019re-\u201d</p><p>But I was cut off by the man in question shooting me with a Taser gun. The prongs hit right at my heart and I could feel the currents flow through me. Harmlessly.</p><p>He scowled at the gun, smacking the side of it with his hand. \u201cPiece of shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you just try to Tase her?!\u201d Fury\u2019s jaw was practically on the floor.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a piece of shit, Talos.\u201d Both sets of eyes snapped to my face. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re trying to use it on a creature that\u2019s had lightning flow through her body on an almost daily basis since she was a child. This,\u201d I gestured at the prongs that still stuck out of my chest, \u201cis the equivalent of a human receiving a static shock. Now. Let me show you how this was supposed to go.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed the protruding wires with my hands, but didn\u2019t remove the prongs. My eyes and hair turned silvery blue as I summoned a lightning bolt. It burst through the window by his desk, hit my body, and traveled down the wires to Talos\u2019 waiting hands. Talos was immediately shot back through the wall behind his desk, the Taser gun exploding from the force of energy. I grabbed Fury and shoved him down so the desk would protect him from the shooting plastic pieces.</p><p>\u201cWHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFury, for fuck sake can you bring your voice down a few dozen notches. We need to get Danvers. Your boss is actually Talos, the head of the skrull army!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think he\u2019s dead?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, if skrulls were that easy to kill, I would have been home ages ago.\u201d I yanked the two prongs out of my chest and grabbed Fury by his jacket before racing down the hall. \u201cMarvel! We got a fucking emergency!!\u201d</p><p>Luck was on my side and Carol happened to be walking by at that very moment. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Is that blood on your chest?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget about that! Talos is Fury\u2019s boss! I just blasted his ass through a wall, but you need to finish the job.\u201d</p><p>Without waiting any further, Carol raced towards the room we just left. I took a deep breath and headed back towards the hospital wing.</p><p>\u201cWait, aren\u2019t you going with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Fury. Carol can handle herself. I need\u2026. I need to get\u2026\u201d I closed my eyes and sighed. \u201cHome. I need to go home. I\u2019ve been here far too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really going to do it. You\u2019re going to leave him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to, but I need to. I need him to live.\u201d</p><p>Fury nodded his head. \u201cI still think it\u2019s a big mistake, but after what I just saw you do to Talos, I\u2019m not going to fight you.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a small smile. \u201cThanks, Fury. I\u2019m sure our paths will cross once again. Governments have a bad habit of sticking their nose where it doesn\u2019t belong.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure they will.\u201d</p><p>Back in the hospital wing, I hid close by to Everett\u2019s room and listened to the doctor\u2019s diagnosis as he talked to Coulson.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t explain it. It\u2019s as if a foreign source is causing him to be ill. All we can do is wait.\u201d</p><p>My heart broke at the news. I was right; I was killing Everett. The moment the doctor and Coulson walked away from the room, I quietly slipped in. Everett was hooked up to a couple different machines to keep track of his vitals and to help him breath. A small sob left my lips. Seeing the doctor left behind his clipboard, I flipped to a blank page and began to quickly write a note for when Everett woke up. He would never forgive me, but hopefully this would help him understand. I folded up the piece of paper and tucked it under a glass of water on the nearby table with his name visible.</p><p>I bent down to whisper in his ear. \u201cEv, I am so sorry it\u2019s come to this. I never wanted to leave you, but I can\u2019t stay and watch you die at my hands. I love you.\u201d</p><p>Kissing his cheek on last time, I snuck out the door and off the base.</p><p><a href=\"https://my-marvel-musings.tumblr.com/post/182224411233/broken-wings\">Chapter 14</a></p>",

She makes a choice in regards to Everett and hopes she doesn\u2019t regret it.\n\n</p><p><b>Warnings: Explicit Language, Suggested Smut, Angst</b></p>[[MORE]]<p>For the next four years, Captain Marvel and I hopped from planet to planet fighting skrulls. We mostly bounced between Earth and her home, but occasionally we made a side stop based on any intel she received from people she trusted. Since half of our battles were fought on another planet, only my control on fire, lightning, and wind remained with me. But my inability to heal from heavy hits is what caused us to return to Earth as often as we did. </p><p>We learned a great deal from each other. She found it fascinating to see how the Earth healed me in different ways depending on my level of injuries. I was baffled at how she was able to harness the power of a white hole to use in battle. Carol told me about the Kree Empire, the work that Ronan was doing to secure their future, and how she was found on Earth after an accident which lead her to meeting Fury and Coulson. And in return, I tried my best to explain mutants and the X-Gene.</p><p>\u201cBut if you all have the same gene that causes mutation, why is each mutation different?\u201d We were exiting her ship after we landed at the military base back in California.</p><p>\u201cHonestly? You should probably talk to Dr McCoy about that. I\u2019m sure it has something to do with alleles, or something on that level.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re unsure?\u201d Carol glanced in my direction as we walked down the halls to the barracks.</p><p>\u201cWell, a majority of my knowledge on biology was gained during the 1500s, so needless to say there are some holes in my education. I\u2019ve done my best to self-teach myself the ways that science and technology has changed, but mostly I\u2019ve had to rely on Charles and Hank to fill in the gaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo the others know how old you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFury has an idea that I\u2019m older than I appear. What number he\u2019s guessing at, I haven\u2019t a clue. As for Coulson and Ross, no. And I\u2019d like to keep it that way.\u201d</p><p>She stopped and grabbed my arm. \u201cRoss doesn\u2019t know? I thought you and he were\u2026.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends. He and I are friends.\u201d But I couldn\u2019t look at her in the eyes as I said it. In truth, I had really missed Everett while I was traveling around the galaxy. And the more I thought about him, the more I realized I had made a mistake by telling him no.</p><p>Carol sighed and let go of my arm. \u201cSomehow I\u2019m not entirely convinced by that. Why don\u2019t you go find him? We\u2019re not scheduled to leave again for a couple of months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a sinking feeling I\u2019m too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Has he mentioned anything the last time you were here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that he felt he never saw me enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s time to make up for lost time.\u201d She shoved me in the direction of the men\u2019s barracks before heading down a different hall.</p><p>I shook my head before continuing down the path she had pointed me towards. Taking a deep breath, I knocked quickly on his door. His eyes grew wide as he took in the site of me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. Danvers says we\u2019ll be here for a few months this time so I thought I\u2019d check up on my favorite pilot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll glad you\u2019ll finally be here for a while. I feel like we never get to talk as much.\u201d His eyes subconsciously went up and down my body, sending a feeling deep into my stomach.</p><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m so sorry. Can I come in? I\u2019ve really missed you.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t think it was possible for his eyes to get any wider. \u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Like I said, you mean a lot to me, Ev.\u201d</p><p>He licked his lips as he stared at me, like he couldn\u2019t believe I was really there. \u201cIt\u2019s been so long since anyone has called me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you prefer Everett?\u201d I took a tentative step towards him.</p><p>\u201cNot a chance.\u201d Before I could say anything else, he pulled me in roughly for a kiss. I wrapped my arms around him and followed him inside, kicking the door closed behind us.</p><p>That night we laid in his small bed, my head on his chest. The sound of his heartbeat was calming after all those quiet nights on the ship. I decided to break the silence. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to leave with Carol this next time.\u201d</p><p>I could hear the smile in his voice. \u201cPart of me wants to believe it\u2019s because of tonight, but I know you better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I won\u2019t lie and say this didn\u2019t help push me towards that decision. But in all honesty, I\u2019m not meant for space travel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it like out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEerily quiet and massively expansive. Really makes you feel small and it\u2019s a bit unsettling. But it\u2019s also amazingly beautiful at times.\u201d</p><p>He trailed his fingers over my arm that was draped over his chest. \u201cSo\u2026um,\u201d he cleared his throat, \u201cwhat made you change your mind about us?\u201d</p><p>I let out a long sigh. \u201cThis last trip\u2026. it almost went horribly wrong. I managed to remain unharmed, but it was a big wake up call that my power is here on Earth and I can\u2019t take it with me. Before all this I was helping my old friend Charles start a school to help our kind and I still want to help. And I very well can\u2019t do that if I\u2019m dead because some skrull decided they had enough of me. It also made me realize how alone I have been these past twenty years. You\u2019re not the man I lost and I\u2019m glad for that. You\u2019re someone who will combat my darker side, not feed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a darker side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone has a darker side, Ev. Some are just darker than others. I\u2019m not ready to talk about my past yet, but I do want to see if we can make this work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ve known each other for five years now without me knowing your past. I think I can wait a little longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The next month felt like I was home again, which was an odd concept for me. I was not the kind to feel comfortable around military and government people, but yet here I was trying to date a pilot while forming bonds with Fury, Coulson, and Danvers. Danvers seemed to take it in stride that I didn\u2019t want to return with her this last time, but that didn\u2019t stop her from subtly trying to change my mind every day at lunch. Fury (who now sported an eye patch thanks to the injury he received at the beginning of this war) was glad that I had decided to stick around the base, even if it mostly was because of Everett. He felt this war was far from over and wanted me close by when shit hit the fan.</p><p>And as it happens with my life, that\u2019s exactly what happened. </p><p>It started with Everett. I went to visit him one night and he looked deathly pale when he opened the door. \u201cOh my god, Everett! Are you alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m just running a fever is all.\u201d</p><p>I looked at his pupils and something began to buzz in the back of my mind. Like a memory long since buried. \u201cJust a fever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I have felt dizzy as well as dehydrated. But I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just the flu.\u201d</p><p>My blood ran cold. \u201cWe should get you to the hospital wing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fi-\u201d But before he could finish, he passed out on his feet. Luckily, I was close enough to catch him before he could hit the ground. I scooped him into my arms and ran out the door and down the hall.</p><p>I passed both Fury and Coulson on my way who immediately raced after me without waiting for an explanation. In the hospital wing, Fury began to bark orders as I laid Everett down on a stretcher. \u201cDamnit, Ev. Wake up.\u201d</p><p>The doctors wheeled him away as Fury and Coulson turned towards me. \u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to see him today and he looked like death warmed over. I started asking him what was wrong when he passed out! Thank the gods I was close enough to catch him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he tell you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust stuff that made it sound like he had the flu. But his pupils\u2026. they were really small.\u201d</p><p>Fury studied my face. \u201cI take it you\u2019ve seen this before?\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. \u201cYes, but it\u2019s been so many years I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m remembering it correctly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what could it be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe. It\u2019s my mutation, or at least part of it.\u201d I ran my hand through my hair. \u201cPart of me was worried this could happen, but since it hadn\u2019t happened in-\u201d I caught myself before I could reveal an idea of my age, \u201cin many years, I wasn\u2019t a hundred percent sure it could still happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mutation is killing him. I can\u2019t explain it beyond that because I genuinely don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve actually been working with some friends to find out the reason why.\u201d I buried my face in my hands for a moment before looking back at the two gentlemen. \u201cI need to leave before this gets worse. If I leave now, there\u2019s a chance Everett can survive this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just going to abandon him?!\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to respond, but Fury\u2019s boss suddenly burst into the room.</p><p>\u201cYou two,\u201d he gestured at Fury and myself, \u201cwith me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes sir. Coulson, stay here with Ross and report to me once they get a diagnosis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, sir.\u201d</p><p>Before I had a chance to protest, Fury grabbed me by the arm and dragged me after his boss. We sped down several hallways before we finally came to his office. I couldn\u2019t understand why he wanted to speak to me. I knew so little about this man, I didn\u2019t even know his name. And as far as I knew, Coulson and Fury told him I was someone with the Canadian government when I brought that first skrull to this base.</p><p>The man went behind his desk, but remained standing. \u201cNick, I\u2019ve worked with you for many years and I\u2019ve always thought you were a great agent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil now. We\u2019re caught in the middle of an intergalactic war and your hiding a mutant right here on base?!\u201d</p><p>My head snapped up as Fury fumbled to explain the situation. \u201cSir, it\u2019s not what you think. Miss _____ has been helping us fight the skrulls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mutant that you allowed near one of our pilots! And now he\u2019s dying because no doubt he contracted whatever those creatures carry!\u201d</p><p>My eyes narrowed at this. \u201cHow do you know about Captain Ross being ill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?! You dare question me?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the fuck do you know about Everett?! We literally carried him into the hospital five minutes before you walked into the door! And furthermore, how the fuck do you know about me?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour kind never was great at hiding!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the best at hiding, mother fucker! All time champion! Unless\u2026.\u201d my voice trailed off as I caught a glint of green in his eyes. My jaw dropped and my eyes widened as the realization hit me. \u201cHoly fuck! You\u2019re-\u201d</p><p>But I was cut off by the man in question shooting me with a Taser gun. The prongs hit right at my heart and I could feel the currents flow through me. Harmlessly.</p><p>He scowled at the gun, smacking the side of it with his hand. \u201cPiece of shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you just try to Tase her?!\u201d Fury\u2019s jaw was practically on the floor.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a piece of shit, Talos.\u201d Both sets of eyes snapped to my face. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re trying to use it on a creature that\u2019s had lightning flow through her body on an almost daily basis since she was a child. This,\u201d I gestured at the prongs that still stuck out of my chest, \u201cis the equivalent of a human receiving a static shock. Now. Let me show you how this was supposed to go.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed the protruding wires with my hands, but didn\u2019t remove the prongs. My eyes and hair turned silvery blue as I summoned a lightning bolt. It burst through the window by his desk, hit my body, and traveled down the wires to Talos\u2019 waiting hands. Talos was immediately shot back through the wall behind his desk, the Taser gun exploding from the force of energy. I grabbed Fury and shoved him down so the desk would protect him from the shooting plastic pieces.</p><p>\u201cWHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFury, for fuck sake can you bring your voice down a few dozen notches. We need to get Danvers. Your boss is actually Talos, the head of the skrull army!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think he\u2019s dead?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, if skrulls were that easy to kill, I would have been home ages ago.\u201d I yanked the two prongs out of my chest and grabbed Fury by his jacket before racing down the hall. \u201cMarvel! We got a fucking emergency!!\u201d</p><p>Luck was on my side and Carol happened to be walking by at that very moment. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Is that blood on your chest?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget about that! Talos is Fury\u2019s boss! I just blasted his ass through a wall, but you need to finish the job.\u201d</p><p>Without waiting any further, Carol raced towards the room we just left. I took a deep breath and headed back towards the hospital wing.</p><p>\u201cWait, aren\u2019t you going with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Fury. Carol can handle herself. I need\u2026. I need to get\u2026\u201d I closed my eyes and sighed. \u201cHome. I need to go home. I\u2019ve been here far too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really going to do it. You\u2019re going to leave him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to, but I need to. I need him to live.\u201d</p><p>Fury nodded his head. \u201cI still think it\u2019s a big mistake, but after what I just saw you do to Talos, I\u2019m not going to fight you.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a small smile. \u201cThanks, Fury. I\u2019m sure our paths will cross once again. Governments have a bad habit of sticking their nose where it doesn\u2019t belong.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure they will.\u201d</p><p>Back in the hospital wing, I hid close by to Everett\u2019s room and listened to the doctor\u2019s diagnosis as he talked to Coulson.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t explain it. It\u2019s as if a foreign source is causing him to be ill. All we can do is wait.\u201d</p><p>My heart broke at the news. I was right; I was killing Everett. The moment the doctor and Coulson walked away from the room, I quietly slipped in. Everett was hooked up to a couple different machines to keep track of his vitals and to help him breath. A small sob left my lips. Seeing the doctor left behind his clipboard, I flipped to a blank page and began to quickly write a note for when Everett woke up. He would never forgive me, but hopefully this would help him understand. I folded up the piece of paper and tucked it under a glass of water on the nearby table with his name visible.</p><p>I bent down to whisper in his ear. \u201cEv, I am so sorry it\u2019s come to this. I never wanted to leave you, but I can\u2019t stay and watch you die at my hands. I love you.\u201d</p><p>Kissing his cheek on last time, I snuck out the door and off the base.</p><p><a href=\"https://my-marvel-musings.tumblr.com/post/182224411233/broken-wings\">Chapter 14</a></p>",
                "content": "<p>\n\n<b>Chapter 13: No Rest For The Wicked\n\n</b><br /></p><p><b>Summary:&nbsp;\n\n</b>Reader follows Captain Marvel around to fight skrulls before ending up back on Earth. She makes a choice in regards to Everett and hopes she doesn&rsquo;t regret it.\n\n</p><p><b>Warnings: Explicit Language, Suggested Smut, Angst</b></p><p>For the next four years, Captain Marvel and I hopped from planet to planet fighting skrulls. We mostly bounced between Earth and her home, but occasionally we made a side stop based on any intel she received from people she trusted. Since half of our battles were fought on another planet, only my control on fire, lightning, and wind remained with me. But my inability to heal from heavy hits is what caused us to return to Earth as often as we did. </p><p>We learned a great deal from each other. She found it fascinating to see how the Earth healed me in different ways depending on my level of injuries. I was baffled at how she was able to harness the power of a white hole to use in battle. Carol told me about the Kree Empire, the work that Ronan was doing to secure their future, and how she was found on Earth after an accident which lead her to meeting Fury and Coulson. And in return, I tried my best to explain mutants and the X-Gene.</p><p>&ldquo;But if you all have the same gene that causes mutation, why is each mutation different?&rdquo; We were exiting her ship after we landed at the military base back in California.</p><p>&ldquo;Honestly? You should probably talk to Dr McCoy about that. I&rsquo;m sure it has something to do with alleles, or something on that level.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re unsure?&rdquo; Carol glanced in my direction as we walked down the halls to the barracks.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, a majority of my knowledge on biology was gained during the 1500s, so needless to say there are some holes in my education. I&rsquo;ve done my best to self-teach myself the ways that science and technology has changed, but mostly I&rsquo;ve had to rely on Charles and Hank to fill in the gaps.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do the others know how old you are?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fury has an idea that I&rsquo;m older than I appear. What number he&rsquo;s guessing at, I haven&rsquo;t a clue. As for Coulson and Ross, no. And I&rsquo;d like to keep it that way.&rdquo;</p><p>She stopped and grabbed my arm. &ldquo;Ross doesn&rsquo;t know? I thought you and he were&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Friends. He and I are friends.&rdquo; But I couldn&rsquo;t look at her in the eyes as I said it. In truth, I had really missed Everett while I was traveling around the galaxy. And the more I thought about him, the more I realized I had made a mistake by telling him no.</p><p>Carol sighed and let go of my arm. &ldquo;Somehow I&rsquo;m not entirely convinced by that. Why don&rsquo;t you go find him? We&rsquo;re not scheduled to leave again for a couple of months.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have a sinking feeling I&rsquo;m too late.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why? Has he mentioned anything the last time you were here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just that he felt he never saw me enough.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s time to make up for lost time.&rdquo; She shoved me in the direction of the men&rsquo;s barracks before heading down a different hall.</p><p>I shook my head before continuing down the path she had pointed me towards. Taking a deep breath, I knocked quickly on his door. His eyes grew wide as he took in the site of me.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re back!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yup. Danvers says we&rsquo;ll be here for a few months this time so I thought I&rsquo;d check up on my favorite pilot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll glad you&rsquo;ll finally be here for a while. I feel like we never get to talk as much.&rdquo; His eyes subconsciously went up and down my body, sending a feeling deep into my stomach.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, I&rsquo;m so sorry. Can I come in? I&rsquo;ve really missed you.&rdquo;</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t think it was possible for his eyes to get any wider. &ldquo;You did?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course. Like I said, you mean a lot to me, Ev.&rdquo;</p><p>He licked his lips as he stared at me, like he couldn&rsquo;t believe I was really there. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been so long since anyone has called me that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Would you prefer Everett?&rdquo; I took a tentative step towards him.</p><p>&ldquo;Not a chance.&rdquo; Before I could say anything else, he pulled me in roughly for a kiss. I wrapped my arms around him and followed him inside, kicking the door closed behind us.</p><p>That night we laid in his small bed, my head on his chest. The sound of his heartbeat was calming after all those quiet nights on the ship. I decided to break the silence. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to leave with Carol this next time.&rdquo;</p><p>I could hear the smile in his voice. &ldquo;Part of me wants to believe it&rsquo;s because of tonight, but I know you better than that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t lie and say this didn&rsquo;t help push me towards that decision. But in all honesty, I&rsquo;m not meant for space travel.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it like out there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Eerily quiet and massively expansive. Really makes you feel small and it&rsquo;s a bit unsettling. But it&rsquo;s also amazingly beautiful at times.&rdquo;</p><p>He trailed his fingers over my arm that was draped over his chest. &ldquo;So&hellip;um,&rdquo; he cleared his throat, &ldquo;what made you change your mind about us?&rdquo;</p><p>I let out a long sigh. &ldquo;This last trip&hellip;. it almost went horribly wrong. I managed to remain unharmed, but it was a big wake up call that my power is here on Earth and I can&rsquo;t take it with me. Before all this I was helping my old friend Charles start a school to help our kind and I still want to help. And I very well can&rsquo;t do that if I&rsquo;m dead because some skrull decided they had enough of me. It also made me realize how alone I have been these past twenty years. You&rsquo;re not the man I lost and I&rsquo;m glad for that. You&rsquo;re someone who will combat my darker side, not feed it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have a darker side.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Everyone has a darker side, Ev. Some are just darker than others. I&rsquo;m not ready to talk about my past yet, but I do want to see if we can make this work.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve known each other for five years now without me knowing your past. I think I can wait a little longer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>The next month felt like I was home again, which was an odd concept for me. I was not the kind to feel comfortable around military and government people, but yet here I was trying to date a pilot while forming bonds with Fury, Coulson, and Danvers. Danvers seemed to take it in stride that I didn&rsquo;t want to return with her this last time, but that didn&rsquo;t stop her from subtly trying to change my mind every day at lunch. Fury (who now sported an eye patch thanks to the injury he received at the beginning of this war) was glad that I had decided to stick around the base, even if it mostly was because of Everett. He felt this war was far from over and wanted me close by when shit hit the fan.</p><p>And as it happens with my life, that&rsquo;s exactly what happened. </p><p>It started with Everett. I went to visit him one night and he looked deathly pale when he opened the door. &ldquo;Oh my god, Everett! Are you alright?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m just running a fever is all.&rdquo;</p><p>I looked at his pupils and something began to buzz in the back of my mind. Like a memory long since buried. &ldquo;Just a fever?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I have felt dizzy as well as dehydrated. But I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s just the flu.&rdquo;</p><p>My blood ran cold. &ldquo;We should get you to the hospital wing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be fi-&rdquo; But before he could finish, he passed out on his feet. Luckily, I was close enough to catch him before he could hit the ground. I scooped him into my arms and ran out the door and down the hall.</p><p>I passed both Fury and Coulson on my way who immediately raced after me without waiting for an explanation. In the hospital wing, Fury began to bark orders as I laid Everett down on a stretcher. &ldquo;Damnit, Ev. Wake up.&rdquo;</p><p>The doctors wheeled him away as Fury and Coulson turned towards me. &ldquo;What the hell happened?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I went to see him today and he looked like death warmed over. I started asking him what was wrong when he passed out! Thank the gods I was close enough to catch him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did he tell you anything?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just stuff that made it sound like he had the flu. But his pupils&hellip;. they were really small.&rdquo;</p><p>Fury studied my face. &ldquo;I take it you&rsquo;ve seen this before?&rdquo;</p><p>I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. &ldquo;Yes, but it&rsquo;s been so many years I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m remembering it correctly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So what could it be?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Me. It&rsquo;s my mutation, or at least part of it.&rdquo; I ran my hand through my hair. &ldquo;Part of me was worried this could happen, but since it hadn&rsquo;t happened in-&rdquo; I caught myself before I could reveal an idea of my age, &ldquo;in many years, I wasn&rsquo;t a hundred percent sure it could still happen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is happening?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My mutation is killing him. I can&rsquo;t explain it beyond that because I genuinely don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve actually been working with some friends to find out the reason why.&rdquo; I buried my face in my hands for a moment before looking back at the two gentlemen. &ldquo;I need to leave before this gets worse. If I leave now, there&rsquo;s a chance Everett can survive this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just going to abandon him?!&rdquo;</p><p>I opened my mouth to respond, but Fury&rsquo;s boss suddenly burst into the room.</p><p>&ldquo;You two,&rdquo; he gestured at Fury and myself, &ldquo;with me now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes sir. Coulson, stay here with Ross and report to me once they get a diagnosis.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>Before I had a chance to protest, Fury grabbed me by the arm and dragged me after his boss. We sped down several hallways before we finally came to his office. I couldn&rsquo;t understand why he wanted to speak to me. I knew so little about this man, I didn&rsquo;t even know his name.

Talos was immediately shot back through the wall behind his desk, the Taser gun exploding from the force of energy. I grabbed Fury and shoved him down so the desk would protect him from the shooting plastic pieces.</p><p>&ldquo;WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fury, for fuck sake can you bring your voice down a few dozen notches. We need to get Danvers. Your boss is actually Talos, the head of the skrull army!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think he&rsquo;s dead?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Trust me, if skrulls were that easy to kill, I would have been home ages ago.&rdquo; I yanked the two prongs out of my chest and grabbed Fury by his jacket before racing down the hall. &ldquo;Marvel!

So why don\u2019t you ever join them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m actually horrible at hitting on girls. And to be honest, there\u2019s already someone who\u2019s caught my eye. I just don\u2019t know what to do about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEv! Why didn\u2019t you tell me sooner? I\u2019m a great wingman -er, wingwoman. Whatever. I totally could have put in a few dozen good words for you.\u201d</p><p>Everett blushed as he lined up his shot. \u201cThanks, but I know I\u2019m not her type. I hear stories about her ex and there\u2019s no way I could compete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s a good thing! He\u2019s clearly her ex for a reason. You could have all the good qualities he didn\u2019t.\u201d I took my shot then picked up my beer. \u201cAnd don\u2019t ever worry about not being someone\u2019s type. Any woman who wouldn\u2019t date you is an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just saying that cause you\u2019re my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, best friend! And not 100 percent true. I said it because I meant it. You remind me a lot of the man I lost. You\u2019re stubborn, protective, loyal, determined, and funny. Not to mention good looking.\u201d He blushed harder. \u201cAny woman would be damn lucky to have you and can fight me if they don\u2019t agree.\u201d</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, _____. That means a lot coming from you.&rdquo; He stood next to me as I leaned against a wall. </p><p>&ldquo;Normally this is where I would bug you for her name, but I&rsquo;ll let it slide tonight. However, I do expect to know who she is before I leave. I plan to talk you up and make sure to give my seal of approval before I leave.&rdquo;</p><p>Everett just shook his head at me. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it. Really. She- uh&hellip;&rdquo; he sighed and tilted his head back against the wall, &ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Suddenly it dawned on me and frankly I was ashamed with myself for not picking up the signs sooner. I nudged Everett with my elbow. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sweat it. If you don&rsquo;t want to talk about her or want me talking to her, then we&rsquo;ll just drop it. I&rsquo;m sorry I bugged you about it. You mean a lot to me and I don&rsquo;t ever want you to feel uncomfortable about talking to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; He turned his head to look at me. &ldquo;Wait, I mean a lot to you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; I looked down at my feet. &ldquo;My past is hella complicated and frankly a really long and traumatizing story. But in the end, you&rsquo;re one of the few people I still have in my life. Or at least, one of the few people I can trust.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;After less than a year of knowing me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you really arguing over this?&rdquo; I chuckled and looked back at him. &ldquo;People in my life, the ones I know besides the people here, they know my whole past and are in some way entangled in a part of it. But you&hellip;. you just know me as some random woman that was living out in the woods by herself. I&rsquo;m not my past. When you look at me, it&rsquo;s not in fear or anticipation or opportunity or curiosity. You just see me. Only one other person looked at me that way and it&rsquo;s been so long I&rsquo;d almost forgotten what it was like.&rdquo;</p><p>Everett and I looked at each other as my words hung in the air. Then very slowly, he closed the gap and pressed his lips to mine. It was brief, sweet, and when he pulled away there was that slight blush again. He smiled and leaned in again. I put my hand on his chest, stopping him.</p><p>&ldquo;Ev, as nice as that was, we can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; My heart ripped in half at seeing his face fall. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not because of my past, it&rsquo;s because of your future. You deserve the best and I am nowhere near it. There&rsquo;s so much to me and my past that if we got together&hellip;. it could very well hurt your chances to get into the CIA.&rdquo;</p><p>His head jerked back at this. &ldquo;What? Why would dating you effect that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m the type of mutant governments fear. And you will always have that cloud hanging over you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;____, what are you talking about? All you have is super str- did you lie to us about your mutation?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, just omitted quite a bit. It was a deal I made in order to be kept here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t tell me, the person you claim to be your best friend.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You have every right to be angry at me. I would be as well. But it won&rsquo;t change my mind, Ev. You&rsquo;re safer not knowing the truth about me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Safe? From whom?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;From myself. From Magneto. From the scrutiny of the public. Take your pick.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;____, I don&rsquo;t care about what the public thinks and I can&rsquo;t care about Magneto as I have never really heard much about him after what he did in the 70s. And I know you would never hurt me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not on purpose, no. But&hellip; my mutation isn&rsquo;t safe for anyone who can&rsquo;t heal themselves. I&rsquo;m sorry, Ev.&rdquo;</p><p>We headed back to the military base, the back of the cab filled with tension. It was so painful, especially since I wanted to give in to what Ev was feeling towards me. But I couldn&rsquo;t put him at risk; I stayed a nomad for a reason. And if public opinion didn&rsquo;t matter, there was still the fact that I would outlive him without even trying. And how would I even begin to try to explain that one without possibly sounding crazy?</p><p>Once inside, I expected Everett to just walk off towards his barrack with barely a goodbye. Instead, he grabbed my hand and pulled me in for a hug. &ldquo;It would be easy for me to be mad, but in honestly I can&rsquo;t be. I care about you, a lot. I want nothing more than to be given a chance to be together, but I won&rsquo;t force you. Between your past, not being comfortable around government agents, and your last&hellip; lover that you always dance around to the point I don&rsquo;t even know his name, I understand your hesitation. Just know if you ever change your mind, I&rsquo;m here. And I won&rsquo;t stop being your friend if you say no.&rdquo;</p><p>I wiped a tear away as we pulled apart. &ldquo;Thank you, Everett. I know it&rsquo;s not easy being a friend with a mutant, especially one who hides to survive. I still mean what I said. You mean a lot to me and that won&rsquo;t change. Sleep well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You, too.&rdquo;</p><p>I wandered down the halls, replaying the night with Everett in my head. I was so engrossed with deciding on whether or not I should run back to him that I almost ran into Captain Marvel.</p><p>\u201cOh, Danvers! Sorry about that, my head was elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly. Are you ok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly? No. But I never have been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh, comes with the territory.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cHow goes the skrull hunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be better with help.\u201d She smirked at me.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI outta punch Fury in the dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not his fault. I kinda threatened him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFabulous. Still doesn\u2019t change that I can\u2019t help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the way that Fury wants, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh lord. What did you have in mind, ET?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes at the nickname. \u201cWe\u2019re going on a recon mission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we. Grab a bag of clothes. We leave at dawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you need me to agree to this insanity first?\u201d</p><p>\u201c_____, if we don\u2019t do this, your world will be caught in the middle of a thousand year old war. One it\u2019s not able to defend itself against. Even with your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, where do we begin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn my homeworld.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.

Any woman who wouldn\u2019t date you is an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just saying that cause you\u2019re my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, best friend! And not 100 percent true. I said it because I meant it. You remind me a lot of the man I lost. You\u2019re stubborn, protective, loyal, determined, and funny. Not to mention good looking.\u201d He blushed harder. \u201cAny woman would be damn lucky to have you and can fight me if they don\u2019t agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, _____. That means a lot coming from you.\u201d He stood next to me as I leaned against a wall. </p><p>\u201cNormally this is where I would bug you for her name, but I\u2019ll let it slide tonight. However, I do expect to know who she is before I leave. I plan to talk you up and make sure to give my seal of approval before I leave.\u201d</p><p>Everett just shook his head at me. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Really. She- uh\u2026\u201d he sighed and tilted his head back against the wall, \u201cI\u2026\u201d</p><p>Suddenly it dawned on me and frankly I was ashamed with myself for not picking up the signs sooner. I nudged Everett with my elbow. \u201cDon\u2019t sweat it. If you don\u2019t want to talk about her or want me talking to her, then we\u2019ll just drop it. I\u2019m sorry I bugged you about it. You mean a lot to me and I don\u2019t ever want you to feel uncomfortable about talking to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He turned his head to look at me. \u201cWait, I mean a lot to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I looked down at my feet. \u201cMy past is hella complicated and frankly a really long and traumatizing story. But in the end, you\u2019re one of the few people I still have in my life. Or at least, one of the few people I can trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter less than a year of knowing me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you really arguing over this?\u201d I chuckled and looked back at him. \u201cPeople in my life, the ones I know besides the people here, they know my whole past and are in some way entangled in a part of it. But you\u2026. you just know me as some random woman that was living out in the woods by herself. I\u2019m not my past. When you look at me, it\u2019s not in fear or anticipation or opportunity or curiosity. You just see me. Only one other person looked at me that way and it\u2019s been so long I\u2019d almost forgotten what it was like.\u201d</p><p>Everett and I looked at each other as my words hung in the air. Then very slowly, he closed the gap and pressed his lips to mine. It was brief, sweet, and when he pulled away there was that slight blush again. He smiled and leaned in again. I put my hand on his chest, stopping him.</p><p>\u201cEv, as nice as that was, we can\u2019t.\u201d My heart ripped in half at seeing his face fall. \u201cIt\u2019s not because of my past, it\u2019s because of your future. You deserve the best and I am nowhere near it. There\u2019s so much to me and my past that if we got together\u2026. it could very well hurt your chances to get into the CIA.\u201d</p><p>His head jerked back at this. \u201cWhat? Why would dating you effect that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m the type of mutant governments fear. And you will always have that cloud hanging over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201c____, what are you talking about? All you have is super str- did you lie to us about your mutation?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just omitted quite a bit. It was a deal I made in order to be kept here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you won\u2019t tell me, the person you claim to be your best friend.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou have every right to be angry at me. I would be as well. But it won\u2019t change my mind, Ev. You\u2019re safer not knowing the truth about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafe? From whom?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom myself. From Magneto. From the scrutiny of the public. Take your pick.\u201d</p><p>\u201c____, I don\u2019t care about what the public thinks and I can\u2019t care about Magneto as I have never really heard much about him after what he did in the 70s. And I know you would never hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on purpose, no. But\u2026 my mutation isn\u2019t safe for anyone who can\u2019t heal themselves. I\u2019m sorry, Ev.\u201d</p><p>We headed back to the military base, the back of the cab filled with tension. It was so painful, especially since I wanted to give in to what Ev was feeling towards me. But I couldn\u2019t put him at risk; I stayed a nomad for a reason. And if public opinion didn\u2019t matter, there was still the fact that I would outlive him without even trying. And how would I even begin to try to explain that one without possibly sounding crazy?</p><p>Once inside, I expected Everett to just walk off towards his barrack with barely a goodbye. Instead, he grabbed my hand and pulled me in for a hug. \u201cIt would be easy for me to be mad, but in honestly I can\u2019t be. I care about you, a lot. I want nothing more than to be given a chance to be together, but I won\u2019t force you. Between your past, not being comfortable around government agents, and your last\u2026 lover that you always dance around to the point I don\u2019t even know his name, I understand your hesitation. Just know if you ever change your mind, I\u2019m here. And I won\u2019t stop being your friend if you say no.\u201d</p><p>I wiped a tear away as we pulled apart. \u201cThank you, Everett. I know it\u2019s not easy being a friend with a mutant, especially one who hides to survive. I still mean what I said. You mean a lot to me and that won\u2019t change. Sleep well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>I wandered down the halls, replaying the night with Everett in my head. I was so engrossed with deciding on whether or not I should run back to him that I almost ran into Captain Marvel.</p><p>\u201cOh, Danvers! Sorry about that, my head was elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly. Are you ok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly? No. But I never have been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh, comes with the territory.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cHow goes the skrull hunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be better with help.\u201d She smirked at me.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI outta punch Fury in the dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not his fault. I kinda threatened him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFabulous. Still doesn\u2019t change that I can\u2019t help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the way that Fury wants, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh lord. What did you have in mind, ET?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes at the nickname. \u201cWe\u2019re going on a recon mission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we. Grab a bag of clothes. We leave at dawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you need me to agree to this insanity first?\u201d</p><p>\u201c_____, if we don\u2019t do this, your world will be caught in the middle of a thousand year old war. One it\u2019s not able to defend itself against. Even with your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, where do we begin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn my homeworld.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.

Everett slowly fills the hole in her heart.\n\n</p><p><b>Warnings: Explicit Language</b></p><!-- more --><p>I paced in the cold, sterile medical room, my footsteps the only sound other than the quiet slicing of a scalpel. Fury was sitting on a stool with a gun pointed at the dead body, one hand holding an ice pack to his left eye. Coulson was standing on the other side of the operating table, but had his focus on my pacing. This was the third dissection I was a part of, but the waiting was never any easier. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to complain,&rdquo; Coulson started.</p><p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re going to,&rdquo; I finished. &ldquo;Listen, I get it. I can see how annoying I&rsquo;m being, but this is the third skrull we&rsquo;ve caught and we&rsquo;ve learned literally nothing. I&rsquo;m starting to feel that my whole coming here was pointless. Beyond giving you guys that first body.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So why do you stay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not. Once this is done, I&rsquo;m leaving. There isn&rsquo;t really a point or a need for me to be here.&rdquo;</p><p>Fury looked up and removed his ice pack, revealing the fresh wounds over his eye. There was talk that he may lose use of that eye very soon. &ldquo;You may think this is pointless, but we need your help.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s been almost a year, three skrulls later, and one fallen alien that&rsquo;s supposedly on our side, and I have yet to see the point of me being here.&rdquo; I stopped pacing and watched the surgeon pull apart the skrull. Three of these and we had yet to figure out how they could shape shift so easily. At least with a mutant like Raven we understood the basics. But these aliens were leaving us hopelessly confused.</p><p>&ldquo;You could tell that the one who came for you wasn&rsquo;t Captain Ross. We need a skill like that on our side.&rdquo;</p><p>I looked over at him with a &lsquo;are you fucking kidding me?&rsquo; look on my face. &ldquo;Fury, the only reason why I knew something was amiss the first time was because the alien&rsquo;s story made zero sense. Plus, other reasons that would literally never apply to a hunt of these creatures. Also, shape shifting isn&rsquo;t exactly something new to me. You have Captain Marvel, a freaking kree who&rsquo;s been purposely trained to spot these assholes. Utilize her more, for fuck sake.&rdquo;</p><p>The surgeon suddenly spoke up. &ldquo;Special agent Fury, I&rsquo;m all done with this specimen. I&rsquo;m afraid there is nothing new to report.&rdquo;</p><p>I rolled my eyes and gestured upwards with one hand, as if to say 'no surprise there&rsquo;. Fury sighed and nodded his head. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we were afraid of. Go ahead and log all your notes and I&rsquo;ll make sure Danvers takes a look at it later.&rdquo;</p><p>The surgeon finished cleaning up and took his notes before leaving the room. I took one last look at the empty body before leaving the room, ignoring Fury and Coulson calling after me. Nine months ago I came to their hidden military base with the body of the skrull and unanswerable questions. In that time, I helped Fury&rsquo;s secret club (they really need to find a shorter name to refer to their damn branch) find and capture two more skrulls, help Carol Danvers (AKA Captain Marvel according to her) re-adjust to being on Earth, and regret every damn minute. Such a fucking waste of time. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, ____! Where are you running off to?&rdquo;</p><p>I looked over my shoulder and gave a small smile. &ldquo;Hey, Ev. Not sure in the long run. Currently, going to grab some lunch. How about you?&rdquo; </p><p>Everett jogged to catch up with me. &ldquo;Want company for lunch?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure, thanks.&rdquo; He blushed as he held the cafeteria door open for me. &ldquo;So how was training?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good, Stark&rsquo;s starting to make the planes easier to handle.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. At least he can take constructive criticism.&rdquo; We sat at a table away from most of the crowd. This had become a regular event for us: Everett would train on new planes or do practice exams for when he could join the CIA while I met with Fury, Coulson, or both to discuss the impending alien invasion. Then we would meet up for either lunch or dinner at the military cafeteria. We were starting to form an unlikely friendship and I would honestly miss him when I leave.</p><p>&ldquo;So what do you mean you don&rsquo;t know where you&rsquo;re going in the long run?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not finding a real point to me being here beyond when I first arrived. I was only able to capture that first skrull because the creature was stupid enough to come at me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, how did that happen again?&rdquo;</p><p>Pressing my lips together for a moment, I debated how to answer. I had eventually told Everett I was a mutant, but both he and Coulson were told very limited information on what kind of powers I had. Mainly that I had super strength and speed, which helped explain how I saved him from his downed jet. It was an agreement that Fury and I had in order for me to agree to work with them on this alien invasion. </p><p>I just shook my head. &ldquo;Luck really.

I can see how annoying I\u2019m being, but this is the third skrull we\u2019ve caught and we\u2019ve learned literally nothing. I\u2019m starting to feel that my whole coming here was pointless. Beyond giving you guys that first body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why do you stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. Once this is done, I\u2019m leaving. There isn\u2019t really a point or a need for me to be here.\u201d</p><p>Fury looked up and removed his ice pack, revealing the fresh wounds over his eye. There was talk that he may lose use of that eye very soon. \u201cYou may think this is pointless, but we need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. It\u2019s been almost a year, three skrulls later, and one fallen alien that\u2019s supposedly on our side, and I have yet to see the point of me being here.\u201d I stopped pacing and watched the surgeon pull apart the skrull. Three of these and we had yet to figure out how they could shape shift so easily. At least with a mutant like Raven we understood the basics. But these aliens were leaving us hopelessly confused.</p><p>\u201cYou could tell that the one who came for you wasn\u2019t Captain Ross. We need a skill like that on our side.\u201d</p><p>I looked over at him with a \u2018are you fucking kidding me?\u2019 look on my face. \u201cFury, the only reason why I knew something was amiss the first time was because the alien\u2019s story made zero sense. Plus, other reasons that would literally never apply to a hunt of these creatures. Also, shape shifting isn\u2019t exactly something new to me. You have Captain Marvel, a freaking kree who\u2019s been purposely trained to spot these assholes. Utilize her more, for fuck sake.\u201d</p><p>The surgeon suddenly spoke up. \u201cSpecial agent Fury, I\u2019m all done with this specimen. I\u2019m afraid there is nothing new to report.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and gestured upwards with one hand, as if to say 'no surprise there\u2019. Fury sighed and nodded his head. \u201cThat\u2019s what we were afraid of. Go ahead and log all your notes and I\u2019ll make sure Danvers takes a look at it later.\u201d</p><p>The surgeon finished cleaning up and took his notes before leaving the room. I took one last look at the empty body before leaving the room, ignoring Fury and Coulson calling after me. Nine months ago I came to their hidden military base with the body of the skrull and unanswerable questions. In that time, I helped Fury\u2019s secret club (they really need to find a shorter name to refer to their damn branch) find and capture two more skrulls, help Carol Danvers (AKA Captain Marvel according to her) re-adjust to being on Earth, and regret every damn minute. Such a fucking waste of time. </p><p>\u201cHey, ____! Where are you running off to?\u201d</p><p>I looked over my shoulder and gave a small smile. \u201cHey, Ev. Not sure in the long run. Currently, going to grab some lunch.

At least he can take constructive criticism.\u201d We sat at a table away from most of the crowd. This had become a regular event for us: Everett would train on new planes or do practice exams for when he could join the CIA while I met with Fury, Coulson, or both to discuss the impending alien invasion. Then we would meet up for either lunch or dinner at the military cafeteria. We were starting to form an unlikely friendship and I would honestly miss him when I leave.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you mean you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going in the long run?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not finding a real point to me being here beyond when I first arrived.

I had eventually told Everett I was a mutant, but both he and Coulson were told very limited information on what kind of powers I had.

                "content": "<p>\n\n<b>Chapter 11: Hidden Wars\n\n</b><br /></p><p><b>Summary:&nbsp;\n\n</b>Reader gets involved in an intergalactic battle. Everett slowly fills the hole in her heart.\n\n</p><p><b>Warnings: Explicit Language</b></p><p>I paced in the cold, sterile medical room, my footsteps the only sound other than the quiet slicing of a scalpel. Fury was sitting on a stool with a gun pointed at the dead body, one hand holding an ice pack to his left eye. Coulson was standing on the other side of the operating table, but had his focus on my pacing. This was the third dissection I was a part of, but the waiting was never any easier. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to complain,&rdquo; Coulson started.</p><p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re going to,&rdquo; I finished. &ldquo;Listen, I get it. I can see how annoying I&rsquo;m being, but this is the third skrull we&rsquo;ve caught and we&rsquo;ve learned literally nothing. I&rsquo;m starting to feel that my whole coming here was pointless. Beyond giving you guys that first body.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So why do you stay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not. Once this is done, I&rsquo;m leaving. There isn&rsquo;t really a point or a need for me to be here.&rdquo;</p><p>Fury looked up and removed his ice pack, revealing the fresh wounds over his eye. There was talk that he may lose use of that eye very soon. &ldquo;You may think this is pointless, but we need your help.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s been almost a year, three skrulls later, and one fallen alien that&rsquo;s supposedly on our side, and I have yet to see the point of me being here.&rdquo; I stopped pacing and watched the surgeon pull apart the skrull. Three of these and we had yet to figure out how they could shape shift so easily. At least with a mutant like Raven we understood the basics. But these aliens were leaving us hopelessly confused.</p><p>&ldquo;You could tell that the one who came for you wasn&rsquo;t Captain Ross. We need a skill like that on our side.&rdquo;</p><p>I looked over at him with a &lsquo;are you fucking kidding me?&rsquo; look on my face. &ldquo;Fury, the only reason why I knew something was amiss the first time was because the alien&rsquo;s story made zero sense. Plus, other reasons that would literally never apply to a hunt of these creatures. Also, shape shifting isn&rsquo;t exactly something new to me. You have Captain Marvel, a freaking kree who&rsquo;s been purposely trained to spot these assholes. Utilize her more, for fuck sake.&rdquo;</p><p>The surgeon suddenly spoke up. &ldquo;Special agent Fury, I&rsquo;m all done with this specimen. I&rsquo;m afraid there is nothing new to report.&rdquo;</p><p>I rolled my eyes and gestured upwards with one hand, as if to say 'no surprise there&rsquo;. Fury sighed and nodded his head. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we were afraid of. Go ahead and log all your notes and I&rsquo;ll make sure Danvers takes a look at it later.&rdquo;</p><p>The surgeon finished cleaning up and took his notes before leaving the room. I took one last look at the empty body before leaving the room, ignoring Fury and Coulson calling after me. Nine months ago I came to their hidden military base with the body of the skrull and unanswerable questions. In that time, I helped Fury&rsquo;s secret club (they really need to find a shorter name to refer to their damn branch) find and capture two more skrulls, help Carol Danvers (AKA Captain Marvel according to her) re-adjust to being on Earth, and regret every damn minute. Such a fucking waste of time. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, ____! Where are you running off to?&rdquo;</p><p>I looked over my shoulder and gave a small smile. &ldquo;Hey, Ev. Not sure in the long run. Currently, going to grab some lunch. How about you?&rdquo; </p><p>Everett jogged to catch up with me. &ldquo;Want company for lunch?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure, thanks.&rdquo; He blushed as he held the cafeteria door open for me. &ldquo;So how was training?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good, Stark&rsquo;s starting to make the planes easier to handle.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. At least he can take constructive criticism.&rdquo; We sat at a table away from most of the crowd. This had become a regular event for us: Everett would train on new planes or do practice exams for when he could join the CIA while I met with Fury, Coulson, or both to discuss the impending alien invasion. Then we would meet up for either lunch or dinner at the military cafeteria. We were starting to form an unlikely friendship and I would honestly miss him when I leave.</p><p>&ldquo;So what do you mean you don&rsquo;t know where you&rsquo;re going in the long run?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not finding a real point to me being here beyond when I first arrived. I was only able to capture that first skrull because the creature was stupid enough to come at me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, how did that happen again?&rdquo;</p><p>Pressing my lips together for a moment, I debated how to answer. I had eventually told Everett I was a mutant, but both he and Coulson were told very limited information on what kind of powers I had. Mainly that I had super strength and speed, which helped explain how I saved him from his downed jet. It was an agreement that Fury and I had in order for me to agree to work with them on this alien invasion. </p><p>I just shook my head. &ldquo;Luck really. Some alien showed up looking like you, claiming to have come back when you should have either been back in California or at least on a plane. Nothing at all added up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You knew me that well after 24 hours?&rdquo; He tried smirking at me, but it came off more as a shy smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it was more that it didn&rsquo;t make sense that you would risk your career for someone you didn&rsquo;t know at all. Mainly because you spent most of those 24 hours passed out.&rdquo; We laughed at that. &ldquo;I mean, clearly the alien hadn&rsquo;t spied on me long or it would have picked someone I wouldn&rsquo;t have suspected right away.&rdquo;</p><p>Everett nodded at this. &ldquo;So when are you leaving?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A week at most. There are some things I&rsquo;ll need to take care of with Fury and check in with Danvers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where will you go?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not sure, really. Maybe back to Canada or maybe check in with my old friends in New York. They were dealing with their own crisis when I was drawn into this insanity.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Other mutants?&rdquo;</p><p>I nodded. &ldquo;Yeah, there&rsquo;s a school out there made specifically for our kind, so we have a safe place to live and learn. Charles has been asking me to be a teacher or at least stay nearby. He worried I made myself too isolated after I&hellip; after the events back in the 70s. I was there for him when he lost everything and he&rsquo;s trying to return the favor. My problem is I&rsquo;m too use to isolation.&rdquo;</p><p>Everett slowly reached out to take my hand. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to remain isolated. And you don&rsquo;t have to go back up north if you don&rsquo;t want. Stay near here. I like having someone to help me study for my entry exams.&rdquo;</p><p>I gave a small, sad smile and squeezed his hand. &ldquo;Thanks, but it would probably be best if I didn&rsquo;t keep hanging around a government facility constantly. Governments and mutants typically don&rsquo;t go hand in hand.&rdquo;</p><p>He looked sadly down at our linked hands. &ldquo;Well, how about we go out, just once before you leave.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A jail break?&rdquo; I laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;Why not? I&rsquo;m sure I can get away for one night. And you look like you haven&rsquo;t had fun in a long time. No offence.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;None taken because it&rsquo;s true. The last time I had genuine fun was&hellip;.&rdquo; I trailed off as I thought. When I had Logan was the last time I had real fun. Ages ago. &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s just say it&rsquo;s been a few years.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that.&rdquo; He squeezed my hand. &ldquo;So let&rsquo;s change that! Tomorrow night, you and I go on a jail break. I know of a place nearby with good food and drinks. We can even play a little pool.&rdquo;</p><p>My smile grew wider. &ldquo;Ok, if you insist.
