Dany was increasingly isolated and she was jealous of the love Jon received from his friends and people</h2><p>Dany did not remain lovely for long. Right after that came the ugly part.</p><p>Tormund was very drunk, so he just said outright what he realy thought. He praised Jon for his leadership, braveness, compassion, strength, and the ability to ride a dragon.\u00a0</p><p>Dany is no longer special with Jon\u2019s presence. He has a lot of friends while she does not. He is muched loved when she is isolated. Even dragon-riding, the very capability she is so proud about herself, is no longer her uniqueness.\u00a0</p><p>Dany was clearly hurt when Tormund called Jon a King. Jon was aware of her feelings, so he shared a look with her to make sure that she was alright.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"536\" data-orig-height=\"190\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b79cd3bfa865be31cc139fa2acb9d04/tumblr_inline_prb4ti99jt1v86ltz_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"536\" data-orig-height=\"190\"/></figure><p>Gif:\u00a0<a href=\"https://nothinghappensinalstonville.tumblr.com/post/184783212629/happy-jon-is-a-good-jon\">nothinghappensinalstonville</a></p><p>What I found interesting in this sequence was the choice to frame Dany with a close-up shot with a wide-angle lens. A wide-angle portraiture makes us more engaged with the character\u2019s state of mind because it draws our eyes closer to her/him. But with this framing, the character\u2019s face is also distorted, giving her/him a very unsual look. So this kind of shot is rarely used for close-ups, unless the director has a very specific purpose to tell us something about the character.</p><p>In this frame, Dany had a very ominous look, terrifying even. With the wide-angle lens, her eyes are accentuated. She is fueled with jealousy. Some dangerous thoughts are growing inside her.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"717\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e094366851ceaf7830d3d8931eef70e4/tumblr_inline_pr4phhjYn41u48vsz_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"717\"/></figure><p>Photo: <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/184710486842\">lostlittlesatellites</a><br/></p><p>Dany was hurt, sad and lonely.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1780\" data-orig-height=\"836\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c327e09ede0a41587e4a5084c55f1808/tumblr_inline_pr8dzsorTd1v86ltz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1780\" data-orig-height=\"836\"/></figure><p>Varys noticed that the Queen was not feeling good and welcomed here.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1848\" data-orig-height=\"840\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/99408f92233a6b53ab989dde71427843/tumblr_inline_pr8dzgbfTy1v86ltz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1848\" data-orig-height=\"840\"/></figure><p>Dany looked around.

Everyone\u2019d rather chill with their companions than with the Queen</h2><p>The very notable dynamic during the feast was, everyone was very cheerful and allowed themselves to be loosen up. In such moment, all people wanted to spend their time with the company they were most comfortable with. The Queen was merely present in their eyes. No one came to her or really wanted to spend their fun time with her. Dany was reaping what she sowed, she wanted to be feared and obeyed, she wanted servants not friends. The result: she had no friends at all.

Dany was increasingly isolated and she was jealous of the love Jon received from his friends and people</h2><p>Dany did not remain lovely for long. Right after that came the ugly part.</p><p>Tormund was very drunk, so he just said outright what he realy thought. He praised Jon for his leadership, braveness, compassion, strength, and the ability to ride a dragon.\u00a0</p><p>Dany is no longer special with Jon\u2019s presence. He has a lot of friends while she does not. He is muched loved when she is isolated. Even dragon-riding, the very capability she is so proud about herself, is no longer her uniqueness.\u00a0</p><p>Dany was clearly hurt when Tormund called Jon a King. Jon was aware of her feelings, so he shared a look with her to make sure that she was alright.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"536\" data-orig-height=\"190\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b79cd3bfa865be31cc139fa2acb9d04/tumblr_inline_prb4ti99jt1v86ltz_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"536\" data-orig-height=\"190\"></figure><p>Gif:\u00a0<a href=\"https://nothinghappensinalstonville.tumblr.com/post/184783212629/happy-jon-is-a-good-jon\">nothinghappensinalstonville</a></p><p>What I found interesting in this sequence was the choice to frame Dany with a close-up shot with a wide-angle lens. A wide-angle portraiture makes us more engaged with the character\u2019s state of mind because it draws our eyes closer to her/him. But with this framing, the character\u2019s face is also distorted, giving her/him a very unsual look. So this kind of shot is rarely used for close-ups, unless the director has a very specific purpose to tell us something about the character.</p><p>In this frame, Dany had a very ominous look, terrifying even. With the wide-angle lens, her eyes are accentuated. She is fueled with jealousy. Some dangerous thoughts are growing inside her.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"717\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e094366851ceaf7830d3d8931eef70e4/tumblr_inline_pr4phhjYn41u48vsz_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"717\"></figure><p>Photo: <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/184710486842\">lostlittlesatellites</a><br></p><p>Dany was hurt, sad and lonely.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1780\" data-orig-height=\"836\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c327e09ede0a41587e4a5084c55f1808/tumblr_inline_pr8dzsorTd1v86ltz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1780\" data-orig-height=\"836\"></figure><p>Varys noticed that the Queen was not feeling good and welcomed here.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1848\" data-orig-height=\"840\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/99408f92233a6b53ab989dde71427843/tumblr_inline_pr8dzgbfTy1v86ltz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1848\" data-orig-height=\"840\"></figure><p>Dany looked around.

A wide-angle portraiture makes us more engaged with the character\u2019s state of mind because it draws our eyes closer to her/him. But with this framing, the character\u2019s face is also distorted, giving her/him a very unsual look. So this kind of shot is rarely used for close-ups, unless the director has a very specific purpose to tell us something about the character.</p><p>In this frame, Dany had a very ominous look, terrifying even. With the wide-angle lens, her eyes are accentuated. She is fueled with jealousy.

Jon was aware of her feelings, so he shared a look with her to make sure that she was alright.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b79cd3bfa865be31cc139fa2acb9d04/tumblr_inline_prb4ti99jt1v86ltz_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Gif:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nothinghappensinalstonville.tumblr.com/post/184783212629/happy-jon-is-a-good-jon\">nothinghappensinalstonville</a></p><p>What I found interesting in this sequence was the choice to frame Dany with a close-up shot with a wide-angle lens. A wide-angle portraiture makes us more engaged with the character&rsquo;s state of mind because it draws our eyes closer to her/him. But with this framing, the character&rsquo;s face is also distorted, giving her/him a very unsual look. So this kind of shot is rarely used for close-ups, unless the director has a very specific purpose to tell us something about the character.</p><p>In this frame, Dany had a very ominous look, terrifying even. With the wide-angle lens, her eyes are accentuated. She is fueled with jealousy. Some dangerous thoughts are growing inside her.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e094366851ceaf7830d3d8931eef70e4/tumblr_inline_pr4phhjYn41u48vsz_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Photo: <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/184710486842\">lostlittlesatellites</a><br /></p><p>Dany was hurt, sad and lonely.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c327e09ede0a41587e4a5084c55f1808/tumblr_inline_pr8dzsorTd1v86ltz_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Varys noticed that the Queen was not feeling good and welcomed here.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/99408f92233a6b53ab989dde71427843/tumblr_inline_pr8dzgbfTy1v86ltz_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Dany looked around.

Davos was still concerned about the Lord of Light</h2>\n<p>Even after the war against the Dead is over, Davos still had lingering question about the the Lord of Light and his purpose. Given what we know about R&rsquo;hllor, the Lord of Light might not be a good guy at all. So keep this in mind, in case we encounter this cult and their Lord again.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote><p>Lord of Light. We play his game for him, we fight his war and win, and then he fucks off. No signs, no blessings. Who knows what he wants.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/686d37cd0688b5ab6722f621cade4637/tumblr_inline_pr8di8arYh1v86ltz_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><h2>5. Everyone&rsquo;d rather chill with their companions than with the Queen</h2>\n<p>The very notable dynamic during the feast was, everyone was very cheerful and allowed themselves to be loosen up. In such moment, all people wanted to spend their time with the company they were most comfortable with. The Queen was merely present in their eyes. No one came to her or really wanted to spend their fun time with her. Dany was reaping what she sowed, she wanted to be feared and obeyed, she wanted servants not friends. The result: she had no friends at all. Grey Worm, Missandei and her Dothraki riders didn&rsquo;t come to celebrate with her either.</p>\n<p>Jon was happily celebrating with Sansa, his fellow Northmen and the wildings. Forgetting about courtesy, he sat on the table with his back against Dany.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0ec5d6acb4d81cba4ada2968977db94e/tumblr_inline_pr2mm9B0rm1wq1zgo_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Photo: <a href=\"https://tarotjoie.tumblr.com/post/184685556413/political-jon\">tarotjoie</a><br /></p>\n<p>Dany was almost non-existent.
