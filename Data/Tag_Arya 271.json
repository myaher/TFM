She\u2019s not relevant in their mission to get a wight and he doesn\u2019t know any of the men he\u2019s with were in contact with Arya in the past. So again, she\u2019s not brought up. </p><p>SO. With this idea in mind, can you imagine the looks on Arya and Gendry\u2019s faces when they see each other again in Winterfell?? Both of them thinking the other is dead??? And they\u2019re seeing each other again after the last, what, 4 years???? God, it\u2019s going to be a fantastic reunion </p>",

Still making friends where ever she went. It\u2019s interesting she preferred\u00a0Cat of the Canals\u00a0of all of her disguises. Sidenote: In her backstory for Cat, Arya actually says that Cat arrived to Braavos on ship named Nymeria.</p><br/><blockquote><p>\u201cShe missed the friends she\u2019d had when she was Cat of the Canals; Old Brusco with his bad back, his daughters Talea and Brea, the mummers from the Ship, Merry and her whores at the Happy Port, all the other rogues and wharfside scum. She missed Cat herself the most of all, even more than she missed her eyes. She had liked being Cat, more than she had ever liked being Salty or Squab or Weasel or Arry.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Queen Alysanne planned and funded the building of a Castle called Deep Lake. She had Queensgate named in her honor.\u00a0Arya wants to build Castles</p><p>Alysanne was a fierce believer in woman\u2019s rights and actively changed societies standards. \u201cAlysanne saw no reason why a man should be favored over a woman\u201d.
