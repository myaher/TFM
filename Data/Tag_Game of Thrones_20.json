        "body": "<p>(Ahead there be spoilers. And a lengthy, ugh, rant.)</p><ul><li>\n<br/></li></ul><p><b>Hello again, fellow shippers and GoT enthusiasts.</b> Last week I said I would take everything back with regards to D&amp;D if they didn\u2019t kill off one or both my babies, and here I am, admitting I was wrong. And believe me when I say that I\u2019ve never in my life been happier about being wrong.</p><p>Jaime and Brienne survived the great war. We didn\u2019t get to see nearly enough of their sexy, back-to-back fighting, and it took a whole lot of plot armor for both of them, but they got to see the day after all the same. Now, not to lie, I expected some more badassery, especially from the first female knight in the seven goddamn kingdoms. It annoys me that, out of all the POV characters that actually appear in the show, Brienne is so under-utilized, and I sincerely hope she gets a moment of absolute lady-knight glory sometime in the remaining three episodes.</p><p>Did I just say \u201cthree episodes\u201d? How far we\u2019ve come! From trying to hack down one another to defending one another, from \u201cIs that a woman?\u201d to \u201cI came North because&hellip;<strike> <i>coughIloveyoucough</i></strike> I am not much of a fighter, but-\u201d, Jaime and Brienne have become the quintessential slow-burn romance of modern high fantasy, and we now only have three episodes left until we are provided with some sort of closure to their conjoint arc. D&amp;D impressed me by subverting my expectations and letting both live, but, seeing as last episode was more or less somebody\u2019s well-written fanfic, I am completely in the dark with regards to where everything can go from now on. Therefore, and since this is what Tumblr is mostly about, let there be mad speculation:</p><ol><li><b>Worst case scenario (or, <i>how I punched my TV in my free time and why you could do it, too):</i></b></li>\n</ol><p>Listen, I don\u2019t believe this will happen, but better be prepared for horror than have an actual heart attack, yes? Jaime obviously rode north because of Brienne\u2019s \u201cfuck loyalty\u201d remark, followed by the explanation that, yes, family and houses are one thing, but this -aka the fight against the AotD- is about survival. It is, furthermore, quite safe to assume, given Jaime\u2019s \u201cI wanna die in the arms of the woman I love\u201d mentality, that he rode north to fight, and die for, Brienne. I doubt survival was in his initial plans, and thus I am not sure he\u2019s completely come to terms with the fact that now, the only war left is the one against his -pregnant- sister.</p><p>Oh, sweet mother of bad characterization, could this be a legit case scenario? We all know Jaime Don\u2019t-Ask-Me-To-Betray-My-Family fooking Lannister has an extremely warped sense of duty, and the fact that he never got to be a father for his three deceased children scares me a bit. Let\u2019s face it, a pregnancy is no small thing, even if it occurs within the womb of a woman we all love to hate. It won\u2019t be the first time we\u2019ve seen him relapse, and we know that the fact that he might get killed the moment he approaches the Keep probably won\u2019t deter the fool one bit (he charged at a dragon by himself, not the sharpest tool in the shed). Cersei\u2019s pregnancy hasn\u2019t been mentioned without reason, and unless that reason is somehow Tyrion (I hope not, you absolute, absolute DwILF) Jaime being trapped between two worlds, and two women, could provide some much-needed (and, ugh, badly written) drama for his arc. <br/></p><p>The case against? Literally common logic, but let\u2019s scratch that and take a look at the facts. That baby is dead. I mean, technically it isn\u2019t, but there is no way Cersei can realistically win the war without burning KL to the ground, and I don\u2019t think Jaime, whose arc is one of redemption, could live with himself after that. So, riding North, he must have made peace with the idea that Cersei and her unborn child are, for the sake of humanity if anything, toast. Furthermore, the onslaught of Braime content we were graced with in ep.2 now feels less like a kiss of death and more like groundwork, for, what, exactly? More platonic camaraderie, perhaps. Perhaps D&amp;D\u2019s reading comprehension skills are worse than mine, and English is my second language, so go figure.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>Where could it go? Shakespearean twaddle. You know, the kind of dramatic tomfoolery only Shakespear himself was good at. Incestuous lovers dying in each other\u2019s arms. Jaime realizing a moment too late that team Tarth is where it\u2019s at. Brienne ending up alone or with the comic relief character because idiocy is all the rage these days. Unlikely. <br/></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>2) Best case scenario (or,<i> there is no fucking way they are going down that route, but if they do, I\u2019ll travel all the way to HBO and french-kiss every magnificent bastard I come across): </i></b></p><p>The word here is groundwork. Jaime interrupts his conversation with Tyrion to go stare longingly at Brienne; we get a shit ton of Pride and Prejudice parallels, complete with hopeless banter in the stead of actual flirting; Jaime trails off after saying \u201cI came North, because..\u201d so that every idiot within a hundred-mile radius can add two-plus-two and come up with the inevitable answer to the million dollar question; Tyrion raises his eyebrows when he sees Jaime\u2019s reaction to Brienne; Jaime completely smashes our collective ovaries by saying \u201carise, Brienne of Tarth\u201d in a way that could make deserts wet. <br/></p><p>Why were our eyes blessed with all of that? Up until ep.3 we thought it was D&amp;D\u2019s not-so-subtle way of flagging imminent deaths. But that was not the case, was it? Instead, we saw Jaime and Brienne fight back to back, in a scene that very much paralleled their bridge duel from a few years ago, as if to provide a belated answer to Brienne\u2019s question to Catelyn Stark ( \u201cwho wants to die defending a Lannister? \u201c A wild Brienne appears! She\u2019s VERY effective.)</p><p>An optimist might say that, given how little screen time there was left, everything happened for a reason yet to be disclosed. Episode four is kept under wraps completely. We know that, as an aftermath episode, it will be character driven, and as it happens, the last character driven episode left many hanging ifs with regards to Team Lannistarth. If either of them is ever going to open up and admit romantic feelings, having come face-to-face with death is most likely to do the trick. If there is a time for sweet, sweet lovemaking, that time is now. Tick f*ing tock, you lovelorn idiots. Now kiss.<br/></p><p>The obvious caveat here is once more characterization. Jaime believes he has shit for honour, he literally cannot believe his eyes when he realizes Brienne of all people is happy to be knighted by him. So he probably thinks he drags Brienne down with him if he makes the move. Brienne, on her end, is clueless. Despite her trust in Jaime she expected the knighting to be a farce, not to mention she was flummoxed to see Jaime abstain from insults. Pragmatically speaking, there is no way Jaime can convince her that, he, renowned knight, previously the best fighter in Westeros, ridiculously attractive and once heir to\u00a0 motherf*ing Casterly Rock, is interested in a relationship with Brienne the Beauty, least traditional female ever and recurring joke amongst male fighters. <br/></p><p>How it could all go? The ending, as per GRRM\u2019s words, will be bittersweet. Since he\u2019s never taken the most obvious route, I doubt the sweet end of this arrangement is reserved for Jonerys ( a pity, but I suspect it will be tragic and satisfying for the shippers). Here\u2019s a bonus for you: Jaime Lannister has the worst survival foreshadowing out of every GoT character. He is name number one on everyone\u2019s season 8 death pool. Perhaps this is exactly why he could live up to the very end. Therefore, if he does, and if Brienne is still around, we can dream of the two riding off into the sunset, romantic Braime theme playing, and living the rest of their days on Tarth, or as Ser Brienne and Ser Jaime Lannister, wardens of the west. Yes, we can picture all of that. <br/></p><p>Of course, we can also put our fingers in an electrical outlet. Doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t regret it. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>3) Middle ground, realistic outcome. Or: <i>I have no idea what\u2019s on your mind, D&amp;D. Leak the season before I piss meself. </i><br/></b></p><p>There, I said it. We have no idea how all this will go down. But since this post is about mad speculation, I will conjure up some middle ground Braime endgames for your reading pleasure. <br/></p><ul><li><b>Episode four will reap what was sown in episode 2</b>. Episode 2 was clearly meant to make it clear that something romantic is brewing. So, we get a post-battle heart-to-heart about the way death made Jaime realize he can\u2019t afford to lose any more time, and how, after this new war, they could plan for a life, together. Brienne does not initially believe him, but similarly, facing death has made her wary of losing any opportunity that comes her way. We get one of the three: a kiss, OathSex, or a marriage proposal/ceremony (tons of foreshadowing in both the books and the show: Book Brienne dreams of the lannister sigil on the cloak of the man she is to marry; show Jaime is told he cannot marry Cersei a split second before Brienne passes by). Caveat: This is GoT, and we cannot have nice things. So Jaime, for closure to his Cersei arc, goes south, tries to kill Cersei, and ultimately goes out in a blaze of glory, taking her with him. Kingslayer and Queenslayer. Winner: Poetic Justice. Loser: One (1) Lady Ser being widowed. <br/></li><li><b>Episode four will be underwhelming and we will never get a definite answer on the Braime question</b>. Don\u2019t get me wrong. Everyone and their mother knows they love each other, but they clearly have been pining from afar, believing their object of adoration is out of reach, or simply not interested. So, while it is obvious that Braime exists, and that the stupidest Lannister is no longer interested in Cersei, the show abstains from physical and/or romantic content between our favorite knights, and lets us decide for ourselves. There will be hints, perhaps, if Jaime does die trying to kill Cersei, he might tell his ex lover about Brienne, but nothing beyond that. Caveat: this season the writers have obviously tried to be more feminist, so I want to hope that they will abstain from the sexless romance between ugly woman and attractive man trope. <br/></li><li><b>Episode four is the episode Bronn arrives at Winterfell and freaks every single viewer the f*ck out. </b>He kills Jaime, causes a collective meltdown, but at least we get the \u201cI wanna die in the arms of the woman I love\u201d ending, complete with a confession. Bonus: Brienne kills Bronn. (I hope this doesn\u2019t happen. I love my boy Bronn, first Braime shipper in the seven kingdoms and all around magnificent motherf*er.) <br/></li><li><b>Episode four is still the episode Bronn arrives at Winterfell and freaks every single viewer the f*ck out, only that this time it is Brienne he takes down with him.</b> Brienne wants to die defending a Lannister, and we get to see why Lysa Arrynn once cried out in disbelief: \u201cYou don\u2019t fight with honor!\u201d (Brienne does.) Consolation cookie: Jaime exclaiming something along the lines of \u201cThat was my wife you absolute sellsword!\u201d before offing Bronn, one hand, in the name of love. (U2 music plays softly in the background). Caveat: Come on. The average fanfic is better than that. <br/></li></ul><p>\u00a0Soooo, that was it, that was every mad Braime scenario I would come up with.

Now, not to lie, I expected some more badassery, especially from the first female knight in the seven goddamn kingdoms. It annoys me that, out of all the POV characters that actually appear in the show, Brienne is so under-utilized, and I sincerely hope she gets a moment of absolute lady-knight glory sometime in the remaining three episodes.</p><p>Did I just say \u201cthree episodes\u201d?

D&amp;D impressed me by subverting my expectations and letting both live, but, seeing as last episode was more or less somebody\u2019s well-written fanfic, I am completely in the dark with regards to where everything can go from now on. Therefore, and since this is what Tumblr is mostly about, let there be mad speculation:</p><ol><li><b>Worst case scenario (or, <i>how I punched my TV in my free time and why you could do it, too):</i></b></li>\n</ol><p>Listen, I don\u2019t believe this will happen, but better be prepared for horror than have an actual heart attack, yes? Jaime obviously rode north because of Brienne\u2019s \u201cfuck loyalty\u201d remark, followed by the explanation that, yes, family and houses are one thing, but this -aka the fight against the AotD- is about survival. It is, furthermore, quite safe to assume, given Jaime\u2019s \u201cI wanna die in the arms of the woman I love\u201d mentality, that he rode north to fight, and die for, Brienne. I doubt survival was in his initial plans, and thus I am not sure he\u2019s completely come to terms with the fact that now, the only war left is the one against his -pregnant- sister.</p><p>Oh, sweet mother of bad characterization, could this be a legit case scenario? We all know Jaime Don\u2019t-Ask-Me-To-Betray-My-Family fooking Lannister has an extremely warped sense of duty, and the fact that he never got to be a father for his three deceased children scares me a bit. Let\u2019s face it, a pregnancy is no small thing, even if it occurs within the womb of a woman we all love to hate. It won\u2019t be the first time we\u2019ve seen him relapse, and we know that the fact that he might get killed the moment he approaches the Keep probably won\u2019t deter the fool one bit (he charged at a dragon by himself, not the sharpest tool in the shed). Cersei\u2019s pregnancy hasn\u2019t been mentioned without reason, and unless that reason is somehow Tyrion (I hope not, you absolute, absolute DwILF) Jaime being trapped between two worlds, and two women, could provide some much-needed (and, ugh, badly written) drama for his arc. <br></p><p>The case against? Literally common logic, but let\u2019s scratch that and take a look at the facts. That baby is dead. I mean, technically it isn\u2019t, but there is no way Cersei can realistically win the war without burning KL to the ground, and I don\u2019t think Jaime, whose arc is one of redemption, could live with himself after that. So, riding North, he must have made peace with the idea that Cersei and her unborn child are, for the sake of humanity if anything, toast. Furthermore, the onslaught of Braime content we were graced with in ep.2 now feels less like a kiss of death and more like groundwork, for, what, exactly? More platonic camaraderie, perhaps. Perhaps D&amp;D\u2019s reading comprehension skills are worse than mine, and English is my second language, so go figure.\u00a0 <br></p><p>Where could it go? Shakespearean twaddle. You know, the kind of dramatic tomfoolery only Shakespear himself was good at. Incestuous lovers dying in each other\u2019s arms. Jaime realizing a moment too late that team Tarth is where it\u2019s at. Brienne ending up alone or with the comic relief character because idiocy is all the rage these days. Unlikely. <br></p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>2) Best case scenario (or,<i> there is no fucking way they are going down that route, but if they do, I\u2019ll travel all the way to HBO and french-kiss every magnificent bastard I come across): </i></b></p><p>The word here is groundwork.

Up until ep.3 we thought it was D&amp;D\u2019s not-so-subtle way of flagging imminent deaths. But that was not the case, was it?

Episode 2 was clearly meant to make it clear that something romantic is brewing. So, we get a post-battle heart-to-heart about the way death made Jaime realize he can\u2019t afford to lose any more time, and how, after this new war, they could plan for a life, together. Brienne does not initially believe him, but similarly, facing death has made her wary of losing any opportunity that comes her way. We get one of the three: a kiss, OathSex, or a marriage proposal/ceremony (tons of foreshadowing in both the books and the show: Book Brienne dreams of the lannister sigil on the cloak of the man she is to marry; show Jaime is told he cannot marry Cersei a split second before Brienne passes by). Caveat: This is GoT, and we cannot have nice things. So Jaime, for closure to his Cersei arc, goes south, tries to kill Cersei, and ultimately goes out in a blaze of glory, taking her with him. Kingslayer and Queenslayer. Winner: Poetic Justice. Loser: One (1) Lady Ser being widowed. <br></li><li><b>Episode four will be underwhelming and we will never get a definite answer on the Braime question</b>. Don\u2019t get me wrong. Everyone and their mother knows they love each other, but they clearly have been pining from afar, believing their object of adoration is out of reach, or simply not interested. So, while it is obvious that Braime exists, and that the stupidest Lannister is no longer interested in Cersei, the show abstains from physical and/or romantic content between our favorite knights, and lets us decide for ourselves. There will be hints, perhaps, if Jaime does die trying to kill Cersei, he might tell his ex lover about Brienne, but nothing beyond that. Caveat: this season the writers have obviously tried to be more feminist, so I want to hope that they will abstain from the sexless romance between ugly woman and attractive man trope. <br></li><li><b>Episode four is the episode Bronn arrives at Winterfell and freaks every single viewer the f*ck out. </b>He kills Jaime, causes a collective meltdown, but at least we get the \u201cI wanna die in the arms of the woman I love\u201d ending, complete with a confession. Bonus: Brienne kills Bronn. (I hope this doesn\u2019t happen. I love my boy Bronn, first Braime shipper in the seven kingdoms and all around magnificent motherf*er.) <br></li><li><b>Episode four is still the episode Bronn arrives at Winterfell and freaks every single viewer the f*ck out, only that this time it is Brienne he takes down with him.</b> Brienne wants to die defending a Lannister, and we get to see why Lysa Arrynn once cried out in disbelief: \u201cYou don\u2019t fight with honor!\u201d (Brienne does.) Consolation cookie: Jaime exclaiming something along the lines of \u201cThat was my wife you absolute sellsword!\u201d before offing Bronn, one hand, in the name of love. (U2 music plays softly in the background). Caveat: Come on. The average fanfic is better than that. <br></li></ul><p>\u00a0Soooo, that was it, that was every mad Braime scenario I would come up with.

                "content": "<p>(Ahead there be spoilers. And a lengthy, ugh, rant.)</p><ul><li>\n<br /></li></ul><p><b>Hello again, fellow shippers and GoT enthusiasts.</b> Last week I said I would take everything back with regards to D&amp;D if they didn&rsquo;t kill off one or both my babies, and here I am, admitting I was wrong. And believe me when I say that I&rsquo;ve never in my life been happier about being wrong.</p><p>Jaime and Brienne survived the great war. We didn&rsquo;t get to see nearly enough of their sexy, back-to-back fighting, and it took a whole lot of plot armor for both of them, but they got to see the day after all the same. Now, not to lie, I expected some more badassery, especially from the first female knight in the seven goddamn kingdoms. It annoys me that, out of all the POV characters that actually appear in the show, Brienne is so under-utilized, and I sincerely hope she gets a moment of absolute lady-knight glory sometime in the remaining three episodes.</p><p>Did I just say &ldquo;three episodes&rdquo;? How far we&rsquo;ve come! From trying to hack down one another to defending one another, from &ldquo;Is that a woman?&rdquo; to &ldquo;I came North because&hellip;<strike> <i>coughIloveyoucough</i></strike> I am not much of a fighter, but-&rdquo;, Jaime and Brienne have become the quintessential slow-burn romance of modern high fantasy, and we now only have three episodes left until we are provided with some sort of closure to their conjoint arc. D&amp;D impressed me by subverting my expectations and letting both live, but, seeing as last episode was more or less somebody&rsquo;s well-written fanfic, I am completely in the dark with regards to where everything can go from now on. Therefore, and since this is what Tumblr is mostly about, let there be mad speculation:</p><ol><li><b>Worst case scenario (or, <i>how I punched my TV in my free time and why you could do it, too):</i></b></li>\n</ol><p>Listen, I don&rsquo;t believe this will happen, but better be prepared for horror than have an actual heart attack, yes? Jaime obviously rode north because of Brienne&rsquo;s &ldquo;fuck loyalty&rdquo; remark, followed by the explanation that, yes, family and houses are one thing, but this -aka the fight against the AotD- is about survival. It is, furthermore, quite safe to assume, given Jaime&rsquo;s &ldquo;I wanna die in the arms of the woman I love&rdquo; mentality, that he rode north to fight, and die for, Brienne. I doubt survival was in his initial plans, and thus I am not sure he&rsquo;s completely come to terms with the fact that now, the only war left is the one against his -pregnant- sister.</p><p>Oh, sweet mother of bad characterization, could this be a legit case scenario? We all know Jaime Don&rsquo;t-Ask-Me-To-Betray-My-Family fooking Lannister has an extremely warped sense of duty, and the fact that he never got to be a father for his three deceased children scares me a bit. Let&rsquo;s face it, a pregnancy is no small thing, even if it occurs within the womb of a woman we all love to hate. It won&rsquo;t be the first time we&rsquo;ve seen him relapse, and we know that the fact that he might get killed the moment he approaches the Keep probably won&rsquo;t deter the fool one bit (he charged at a dragon by himself, not the sharpest tool in the shed). Cersei&rsquo;s pregnancy hasn&rsquo;t been mentioned without reason, and unless that reason is somehow Tyrion (I hope not, you absolute, absolute DwILF) Jaime being trapped between two worlds, and two women, could provide some much-needed (and, ugh, badly written) drama for his arc. <br /></p><p>The case against? Literally common logic, but let&rsquo;s scratch that and take a look at the facts. That baby is dead. I mean, technically it isn&rsquo;t, but there is no way Cersei can realistically win the war without burning KL to the ground, and I don&rsquo;t think Jaime, whose arc is one of redemption, could live with himself after that. So, riding North, he must have made peace with the idea that Cersei and her unborn child are, for the sake of humanity if anything, toast. Furthermore, the onslaught of Braime content we were graced with in ep.2 now feels less like a kiss of death and more like groundwork, for, what, exactly? More platonic camaraderie, perhaps. Perhaps D&amp;D&rsquo;s reading comprehension skills are worse than mine, and English is my second language, so go figure.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>Where could it go? Shakespearean twaddle. You know, the kind of dramatic tomfoolery only Shakespear himself was good at. Incestuous lovers dying in each other&rsquo;s arms. Jaime realizing a moment too late that team Tarth is where it&rsquo;s at. Brienne ending up alone or with the comic relief character because idiocy is all the rage these days. Unlikely. <br /></p><p><b><br /></b></p><p><b>2) Best case scenario (or,<i> there is no fucking way they are going down that route, but if they do, I&rsquo;ll travel all the way to HBO and french-kiss every magnificent bastard I come across): </i></b></p><p>The word here is groundwork. Jaime interrupts his conversation with Tyrion to go stare longingly at Brienne; we get a shit ton of Pride and Prejudice parallels, complete with hopeless banter in the stead of actual flirting; Jaime trails off after saying &ldquo;I came North, because..&rdquo; so that every idiot within a hundred-mile radius can add two-plus-two and come up with the inevitable answer to the million dollar question; Tyrion raises his eyebrows when he sees Jaime&rsquo;s reaction to Brienne; Jaime completely smashes our collective ovaries by saying &ldquo;arise, Brienne of Tarth&rdquo; in a way that could make deserts wet. <br /></p><p>Why were our eyes blessed with all of that? Up until ep.3 we thought it was D&amp;D&rsquo;s not-so-subtle way of flagging imminent deaths. But that was not the case, was it? Instead, we saw Jaime and Brienne fight back to back, in a scene that very much paralleled their bridge duel from a few years ago, as if to provide a belated answer to Brienne&rsquo;s question to Catelyn Stark ( &ldquo;who wants to die defending a Lannister? &ldquo; A wild Brienne appears! She&rsquo;s VERY effective.)</p><p>An optimist might say that, given how little screen time there was left, everything happened for a reason yet to be disclosed. Episode four is kept under wraps completely. We know that, as an aftermath episode, it will be character driven, and as it happens, the last character driven episode left many hanging ifs with regards to Team Lannistarth. If either of them is ever going to open up and admit romantic feelings, having come face-to-face with death is most likely to do the trick. If there is a time for sweet, sweet lovemaking, that time is now. Tick f*ing tock, you lovelorn idiots. Now kiss.<br /></p><p>The obvious caveat here is once more characterization. Jaime believes he has shit for honour, he literally cannot believe his eyes when he realizes Brienne of all people is happy to be knighted by him. So he probably thinks he drags Brienne down with him if he makes the move. Brienne, on her end, is clueless. Despite her trust in Jaime she expected the knighting to be a farce, not to mention she was flummoxed to see Jaime abstain from insults. Pragmatically speaking, there is no way Jaime can convince her that, he, renowned knight, previously the best fighter in Westeros, ridiculously attractive and once heir to&nbsp; motherf*ing Casterly Rock, is interested in a relationship with Brienne the Beauty, least traditional female ever and recurring joke amongst male fighters. <br /></p><p>How it could all go? The ending, as per GRRM&rsquo;s words, will be bittersweet. Since he&rsquo;s never taken the most obvious route, I doubt the sweet end of this arrangement is reserved for Jonerys ( a pity, but I suspect it will be tragic and satisfying for the shippers). Here&rsquo;s a bonus for you: Jaime Lannister has the worst survival foreshadowing out of every GoT character. He is name number one on everyone&rsquo;s season 8 death pool. Perhaps this is exactly why he could live up to the very end. Therefore, if he does, and if Brienne is still around, we can dream of the two riding off into the sunset, romantic Braime theme playing, and living the rest of their days on Tarth, or as Ser Brienne and Ser Jaime Lannister, wardens of the west. Yes, we can picture all of that. <br /></p><p>Of course, we can also put our fingers in an electrical outlet. Doesn&rsquo;t mean we won&rsquo;t regret it. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p><b>3) Middle ground, realistic outcome. Or: <i>I have no idea what&rsquo;s on your mind, D&amp;D.

We\u2019ve explained it over and over again to the point where even the locals are saying what we\u2019ve been saying. They don\u2019t care. They want people to worship Danito, they want her to be the protagonist, they want a boring black and white conflict less plot. It\u2019s very annoying. Sansa shows Dany the amount of respect Dany showed her, Sansa told Dany her issues with her (food shortage and Northern independence) and Sansa made it clear to Tyrion that she\u2019s not loyal to Dany.
