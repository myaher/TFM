I just wish he have decency to refuse the kingship in the first place. Especially, it means he usurped his siblings birthrights and inheritance. I never find any appeals of choosing leader who didn't want to be a leader. Why people romanticized reclutant leader is beyond me. His previous leaderships in the Wall, the BoB, etc. proves that he is not even a good leader.",

I think that they think ambition is a sign of evil which is bullshit. You need ambition to push a nation forward. You need ambition to rebuild after a civil war. You need ambition to prepare humanity for an army of the dead. Too much ambition where you end up trampling on innocents to get what you want is the problem. Jon and Daenerys are at extreme ends of this and they both suck at ruling for different reasons. Jon doesn\u2019t discuss culture changing decisions beforehand, goes on missions beneath his station, can\u2019t make long term plans, doesn\u2019t really want the job etc. Daenerys acts on emotion, doesn\u2019t have an objective beyond the Iron Throne, cares more about her image than anything else, makes wildly different and wrong decisions all the time and is fueled entirely by her ambition. They can\u2019t even work together well because Jon isn\u2019t good at negotiating and Daenerys puts her wants first.

This reputation is in part due to his sheer physical size and strength. According to Edward VII, Gregors is almost eight feet tall, and according to Tyrion X, he can hack a man in half with a single blow of his great sword, which he can wield in one hand. There is common consensus that the man is large, and in the context of brutal medieval warfare, this gives him a competitive advantage over his contemporaries.</p> <p>Gregors other strength is his undying loyalty to the Lannisters, whether out of self interest or not. Since his rape of Elia Martell, Gregor has carried out the wishes of the Lannisters to the letter, it is his actions that draw out the Kings men from the court, and he without question serves as champion for Cersei in her trial by combat. Truly, a dog of the house of Lannister moves us to fear.</p> <p>Finally, the sheer brutality of his actions, remorseless to the last, has given him a fearsome reputation that strikes fear into the heart of the enemies of Lannister, known to have killed a man for snoring (Arya IX). Clegane has a thirst for violence, leaving his castle only for tourney and war.</p> <p>So lets take a look at the death of Clegane. The Mountain is struck by Oberyn with a deadly poison, that cannot be cured and is extremely painful and long-lasting. Seems pretty conclusive that this is the end of the road for him, as the Viper&rsquo;s sting cannot be drawn out, right? Wrong.</p> <p>My contention is that Qyburn, maester attached to the Lannister house, somehow found a method to keep Gregor Clegane alive in some sort of zombified state, and that this method has led to the creation of Robert Strong. Qyburn, who was kicked from the citadel for his unorthodox approach to medicine, and claims to know the nature of life and death better than any man living (Cersei II). </p> <p>The Hound, Jaime Lannister and Barristan Selmy all share a mutual disdain for the abilities of the Kingsguard, yet all respect the power of the Mountain. For Cersei to lose such a physically powerful unquestioning servant would likely have spelled the end of her security, what with Jaime having lost his right hand. Thus the motive is clear, and the method also, as Qyburn had been kicked from the citadel for necromancy. </p> <p>Thus we the reader, are presented with Robert Strong, a man as large as Clegane and just as unquestioning, not even expressing verbally his thoughts. Robert strong does not eat, drink or sleep, behaviour we might assign to a ZOMBIE perhaps. None of his skin is ever shown by his armour, likely because of the aforementioned methods of Qyburn.</p> <p>Please, don&rsquo;t allow yourself to be drawn into disbelief and derision quite yet. Consider Robert Strong&rsquo;s past, if he was a real man. He&rsquo;s eight feet tall, and strong to match, and not a single man in westeros has ever referred to him? What was he doing during the clash of kings, his size alone would have had lords across the realm promises oaths of lands, castles and daughters. Something clearly doesn&rsquo;t add up here, Robert Strong is a new element to Westeros, and his source is Clegane. </p> <p>Please let me know your thoughts and any additional lines of enquiries you would like me to follow.</p> </div><br/><br/>\nSource: <a href=\"https://ift.tt/2zOZD4u\">https://ift.tt/2zOZD4u</a>",

        "question": "I'm jealous of best students and girls who fits my society standards of beauty in my school. I have brown skin colour, instead of white. Thus, I'm considered ugly. Still, I didn't hate them. Jealous, yes. Never, hate. It's not their faults that they fit society standards of beauty or they study hard to be best students. It must be the reason why I never hate Sansa. I'm supposed to love Arya more. As, I more similar with book 1 Arya (tomboy, misfits, etc.) Yet, I no longer can tolerate her.",

She has friends but grrm didn\u2019t care much for those friendships. Then for much of her story (in the books) she\u2019s a prisoner in King\u2019s Landing and the Vale. As a prisoner and probably before then, Sansa is mistreated and abused. Her worth as human is repeatedly questioned. She rarely encounters sympathy or empathy from the many characters she meets. Worse we don\u2019t exactly get many flashbacks of happier times. That\u2019s why many people who are outcasts and misfits are drawn to her.

        "answer": "<p><b>This is an AU, obviously.</b></p><p><i>We don\u2019t choose who we love</i>. Joffrey had heard his uncle say these words before, but had never quite understood what they meant. He\u2019d assumed it was in reference to his uncle\u2019s whore wife (or, more recently, his whore lover). Possibly some morality fable that he\u2019d never heard of.</p><p>Of course, Joffrey had never actually understood what love\u00a0<i>was</i>, really. Oh, he loved his mother, of course\u2013what little boy doesn\u2019t love his mother\u2013but that was as far as he\u2019d ever extended affection to anyone. The strongest feelings he had toward his father were those of resentment, and his siblings just grated on him. His uncle Jaime had been nice enough, growing up, but overall, the only person he\u2019d ever loved had been his mother.</p><p>That is, of course, until Brienne arrived in King\u2019s Landing.</p><p>Cersei had hated her from the beginning. She had seemed very fond of Joffrey\u2019s uncle, which bothered his overprotective mother. But time passed, and as it became more evident that Brienne had no feelings for the man, she seemed to relax.</p><p>Joffrey had been fascinated by her, initially. She was large, she was oafish, she was\u2026 charmingly ugly. He found himself thinking about her. Constantly. It was aggravating, really. Why wouldn\u2019t she leave and go back to\u2026 whatever it was hideous woman-knights did in their spare time?</p><p>She was easy to spot in a crowd, and Joffrey began going for walks in an effort to catch a glimpse of her. Between her abnormal height and the fact that she dressed like man, it was easy enough to do. It was a game, he told himself, that\u2019s all. Like a free freakshow. A change of pace from the half-man that was his uncle.<br/>***<br/>Selwyn Tarth had raised her to be many things. A skilled warrior. A confident rider. And <i>very</i>\u00a0observant. Of course, when you keep\u00a0\u201crunning into\u201d the king of Westeros in a city of half a million people\u2026 it didn\u2019t take a maester to realize that something was going on.</p><p>She\u2019d confronted him about it, and he\u2019d given some excuse about making sure his uncle\u2019s rescuer was fitting in to her new life. She noticed the brief stammer in his voice, the way he\u2019d taken a step back as she approached, and the way his eyes kept flicking up and down, as if trying to take her whole height in at once. She clearly dwarfed him.</p><p>But he\u2019d invited her to a private dinner. \u201cTo thank you properly for returning my uncle to me. Even if it wasn\u2019t in one piece,\u201d he\u2019d said. Brienne had been so shocked she\u2019d accepted.</p><p>It had gone\u2026 better than she\u2019d expected. She\u2019d heard about the king\u2019s cruelty, and there certainly seemed to be no shortage of that. Nearly everything he said about anyone was either an outright insult or a backhanded compliment. But none of that extended to her.<br/>***<br/>Time passed of course, as it always does. Joffrey\u2019s mother kept pressing him to take a suitable wife. People were talking, she said. Rumors were spreading. The fact that he spent so much time with that\u00a0\u201cmannish oaf\u201d and the fact that he hadn\u2019t married, she told him, were giving people ideas; there was talk that he was as depraved as his uncle Renly had been. He\u2019d told her to shut her mouth\u2013he was the king and he\u2019d spend time with whoever he liked.</p><p>And, as much as it confused him to admit, he liked Brienne.</p><p>She was polite, but direct. She was sarcastic and biting. She had called him a jackass on more than one occasion. And he could not get enough of her.</p><p>He announced their engagement publicly. He had\u00a0\u201cneglected\u201d to tell her, not wanting to deal with her snide comments about how tall and manly and ungainly and improper Brienne was. (Brienne took the comments in stride when Joffrey mentioned them to her, but that didn\u2019t mean he wanted to hear them, and he got the impression that they bothered Brienne as well. The idea to simply\u2026 <i>not</i>\u00a0repeat the things his mother said never crossed his mind.)</p><p>Cersei confronted him after the announcement in a blaze of fury and hurt. Her tirade just went on and on; Joffrey tuned it out.
