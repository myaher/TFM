Just wanted to see what your opinion is about that. Also sorry if this ask doesn't make a lot of sense, I can't remember exactly what the post said. Love your blog!",
        "answer": "<p>Dear nonny,</p><p>thanks for the compliment!</p><p>And now to my answer: Well, actually, none of the characters in ASOIAF is a feminist character. Feminism means that your goal is the equality of all genders (which is not the same as the genders being all the same), and since none of the characters in ASOIAF fights for equal rights for all women, none of them is a feminist. Full stop. Some of the women of ASOIAF and GoT struggle with the expectations their society has, and they keenly feel the pressure of a patriarchal society on the \u201cright behaviour\u201d of women. Brienne and Arya do that in a way, because they want to fight, although Brienne is also a character who has respect for traditional women like Catelyn. Cersei struggles with the restrictions of her gender, but she severely suffers from internalised misogyny. Sansa is not one of these women. She feels comfortable with the feminine traits that are expected of her and yet like other women she also suffers from patriarchal society. It is a common trait of patriarchy: No women really wins, even the ones that meet the expectation.</p><p>Now, if you look at ASOIAF,/GOT from a modern perspective and want to know if there is any \u201cfeminism\u201d in it you could ask if any of the characters of GoT or ASOIAF is a) a good role model for women of today or b) if they further feminism by putting women into roles usually reserved for men or c) if they are a good representation of women or d) if they make you aware of issues of feminism. And these are all very different&hellip;.</p><p>Well, let\u2019s start with a) and b) and the vexing question if\u00a0 there are \u201cfeminist icons\u201d in ASOIAF, role models for women of today \u201cstrong women\u201d. I don\u2019t know if I would advise my daughter to take any of the ASOIAF women as her role model. Sry, not sry, I don\u2019t want my daughter to run around and murder people, and apart from some of the minor characters they all do, because they live in a society that is different from the one I live in. And how exactly is a woman who fights for her own place in society a \u201cfeminist icon\u201d. To me a feminist icon is a person (of any gender) who fights or fought for the gender equality. I would argue that the suffragettes are feminist icons (even if some of them did not fight for an all inclusive feminism and this is something that bugs me). You could of course say that a figure could be understood as a feminist icon because she transcends the usual role attributed to women in the usual stories. That is something else than a role model though. So, if you take book Sansa I would argue that she is in a way a good role model. She is polite, kind and uses soft skills to navigate the dangerous waters she sails. She could serve as a role model for men as well. These traditionally feminine characteristics are not inherently bad or anti feminist. It is only anti feminist if you tell girls that this is the ONLY way.</p><p>b) So usually strong women or women in traditionally male roles are sold as feminist icons. Wonder woman for example. A female superhero, a role traditionally only played by men. It is in this sense that Da\u20acnerys is usually understood as a &lsquo;feminist icon&rsquo; because people interpret her as being the saviour - a role usually  preserved for men. I would argue that she is not a saviour but the hero from the other side, the villain we saw emerge and that would make her a feminist icon in a way because this role usually is reserved to male characters. In contrast to this, some claim Sansa could not be a feminist icon just because she is traditionally feminine. But this is just not true. I think to have a woman without special superhero skills, a woman who does not try to be a 'man&rsquo; as one (!) of the heroines of the story is revolutionary. The traditionally female coded woman usually is just the trophy wife for the hero. To have her playing an important part in her own right is as unusual as having a female villain with an origin story. In this sense both Da\u20acnerys and Sansa are feminist icons, Da\u20acnerys because she plays a role that is usually reserved for men and Sansa in a very feminine role that is turned on its head because she is important.</p><p>c) I do have some issues with the portrayal of women in ASOIAF - the children just act too old, GRRM really should have read a book on how old people really were when they married in the Middle Ages, and he has far too few female friendships. But I don&rsquo;t think we can complain about the diversity of the women portrayed: There is Arya who is chafed raw by the expectations of society she cannot meet, there is Brienne who is a romantic at heart and yet searches for a place for herself as the strong and tall woman she is, there is Catelyn who is a traditional woman, but sees some of the problems of the system, there is shy Gilly, there is Cersei with her internalised misogyny (who always makes me wonder how she would have been as a man or with another father?) and there is Sansa, the perfect lady who works from within the system and yet seems to learn about some of the problems (I hope we&rsquo;ll see more of Sansa and Mya Stone!), there is Arianne who still has to find her own way. So yes there is very good representation of women of all kinds. Some are more sympathetic than others, but I mainly understand the women in ASOIAF not as types of women but as representations for humans that happen to be women. And this is great! You know one of the issues of feminism is that we should not press women into roles and to have all these women who are not female roles but humans is one of the things I really like about ASOIAF.</p><p>d) Do these women make you aware of issues of feminism? Again my answer would be a firm yes. The problems of patriarchy are addressed again and again and how it hinders women and how it defines their life and how it takes choices  away. </p><p>Now, from what I said it should be clear that Sansa herself is not a feminist character. Therefore she also can&rsquo;t be a faux feminist. Maybe the post you saw was about how Sansa fans are faux feminists - probably because Sansa fans decided to stan a traditionally feminine character.</p><p>This is wrong: feminism is about leaving women a choice. If a woman wants to sew and do embroidery let her do it. If a woman wants to learn fencing let her do it. Freedom of women does not mean that all women should do the same things as men. It means that no woman should be belittled or made fun of for <b>any</b> choice she makes. Feminism is about supporting all women not only the women who aspire to succeed in a male field. Give me the genius female mathematician, give me the skilled embroideress, give me the devoted mum and the independent world traveller&hellip; And do the same for men. Let them be free as well. Let men knit by the fire, let them have fun baking and let them have fun with their kids staying at home. Let them wear make up and beautiful clothing. And let&rsquo;s not forget other genders. The more we let people decide as humans what they want to do with their life, the less we pressure men, women and non binaries to adhere to gender expectations. We still think in boxes. </p><p>And this thinking in boxes leads some to the conclusion that Sansa could only be a <b>strong</b> female character if she learns to reject traditional feminity like Arya does. This is wrong. Sansa is already a strong woman. And why would you wish for her to 'learn her lesson&rsquo; and to stay alone if this is not what she wants? I mean if you say that Sansa can only be a strong woman if she stays alone you are playing into the notion that a male coded behaviour and life is better. People who want Sansa to be less feminine fall into the trap of 'male is better than female&rsquo;. So, I&rsquo;m all for Sansa to learn that her ideas about happiness is not everybody&rsquo;s idea (we see the beginning of that in the Vale I think), but I&rsquo;m also on board for Sansa to get her happy ending :  a husband who is brave, gentle and strong and a bunch of children. </p><p>I would argue that this is not faux feminism but real feminism. Do not put women into boxes. Let them have a choice. Stop the nonsense that only male coded behaviour is strong. Stop the nonsense that women can only be happy if they emulate men - and while we&rsquo;re at it we could do the men a favour and give them a choice as well. And we can start by respecting every choice and finally stop taking down female coded behaviour. </p><p>Thanks for the ask! I hope I got the gist of your question!</p>",

                "content_raw": "<p>Dear nonny,</p><p>thanks for the compliment!</p><p>And now to my answer: Well, actually, none of the characters in ASOIAF is a feminist character. Feminism means that your goal is the equality of all genders (which is not the same as the genders being all the same), and since none of the characters in ASOIAF fights for equal rights for all women, none of them is a feminist. Full stop. Some of the women of ASOIAF and GoT struggle with the expectations their society has, and they keenly feel the pressure of a patriarchal society on the \u201cright behaviour\u201d of women. Brienne and Arya do that in a way, because they want to fight, although Brienne is also a character who has respect for traditional women like Catelyn. Cersei struggles with the restrictions of her gender, but she severely suffers from internalised misogyny. Sansa is not one of these women. She feels comfortable with the feminine traits that are expected of her and yet like other women she also suffers from patriarchal society. It is a common trait of patriarchy: No women really wins, even the ones that meet the expectation.</p><p>Now, if you look at ASOIAF,/GOT from a modern perspective and want to know if there is any \u201cfeminism\u201d in it you could ask if any of the characters of GoT or ASOIAF is a) a good role model for women of today or b) if they further feminism by putting women into roles usually reserved for men or c) if they are a good representation of women or d) if they make you aware of issues of feminism. And these are all very different\u2026.</p><p>Well, let\u2019s start with a) and b) and the vexing question if\u00a0 there are \u201cfeminist icons\u201d in ASOIAF, role models for women of today \u201cstrong women\u201d. I don\u2019t know if I would advise my daughter to take any of the ASOIAF women as her role model. Sry, not sry, I don\u2019t want my daughter to run around and murder people, and apart from some of the minor characters they all do, because they live in a society that is different from the one I live in. And how exactly is a woman who fights for her own place in society a \u201cfeminist icon\u201d. To me a feminist icon is a person (of any gender) who fights or fought for the gender equality. I would argue that the suffragettes are feminist icons (even if some of them did not fight for an all inclusive feminism and this is something that bugs me). You could of course say that a figure could be understood as a feminist icon because she transcends the usual role attributed to women in the usual stories. That is something else than a role model though. So, if you take book Sansa I would argue that she is in a way a good role model. She is polite, kind and uses soft skills to navigate the dangerous waters she sails. She could serve as a role model for men as well. These traditionally feminine characteristics are not inherently bad or anti feminist. It is only anti feminist if you tell girls that this is the ONLY way.</p><p>b) So usually strong women or women in traditionally male roles are sold as feminist icons. Wonder woman for example. A female superhero, a role traditionally only played by men. It is in this sense that Da\u20acnerys is usually understood as a \u2018feminist icon\u2019 because people interpret her as being the saviour - a role usually  preserved for men. I would argue that she is not a saviour but the hero from the other side, the villain we saw emerge and that would make her a feminist icon in a way because this role usually is reserved to male characters. In contrast to this, some claim Sansa could not be a feminist icon just because she is traditionally feminine. But this is just not true. I think to have a woman without special superhero skills, a woman who does not try to be a 'man\u2019 as one (!) of the heroines of the story is revolutionary. The traditionally female coded woman usually is just the trophy wife for the hero. To have her playing an important part in her own right is as unusual as having a female villain with an origin story. In this sense both Da\u20acnerys and Sansa are feminist icons, Da\u20acnerys because she plays a role that is usually reserved for men and Sansa in a very feminine role that is turned on its head because she is important.</p><p>c) I do have some issues with the portrayal of women in ASOIAF - the children just act too old, GRRM really should have read a book on how old people really were when they married in the Middle Ages, and he has far too few female friendships. But I don\u2019t think we can complain about the diversity of the women portrayed: There is Arya who is chafed raw by the expectations of society she cannot meet, there is Brienne who is a romantic at heart and yet searches for a place for herself as the strong and tall woman she is, there is Catelyn who is a traditional woman, but sees some of the problems of the system, there is shy Gilly, there is Cersei with her internalised misogyny (who always makes me wonder how she would have been as a man or with another father?) and there is Sansa, the perfect lady who works from within the system and yet seems to learn about some of the problems (I hope we\u2019ll see more of Sansa and Mya Stone!), there is Arianne who still has to find her own way. So yes there is very good representation of women of all kinds. Some are more sympathetic than others, but I mainly understand the women in ASOIAF not as types of women but as representations for humans that happen to be women. And this is great! You know one of the issues of feminism is that we should not press women into roles and to have all these women who are not female roles but humans is one of the things I really like about ASOIAF.</p><p>d) Do these women make you aware of issues of feminism? Again my answer would be a firm yes. The problems of patriarchy are addressed again and again and how it hinders women and how it defines their life and how it takes choices  away. </p><p>Now, from what I said it should be clear that Sansa herself is not a feminist character. Therefore she also can\u2019t be a faux feminist. Maybe the post you saw was about how Sansa fans are faux feminists - probably because Sansa fans decided to stan a traditionally feminine character.</p><p>This is wrong: feminism is about leaving women a choice. If a woman wants to sew and do embroidery let her do it. If a woman wants to learn fencing let her do it. Freedom of women does not mean that all women should do the same things as men. It means that no woman should be belittled or made fun of for <b>any</b> choice she makes. Feminism is about supporting all women not only the women who aspire to succeed in a male field. Give me the genius female mathematician, give me the skilled embroideress, give me the devoted mum and the independent world traveller\u2026 And do the same for men. Let them be free as well. Let men knit by the fire, let them have fun baking and let them have fun with their kids staying at home. Let them wear make up and beautiful clothing. And let\u2019s not forget other genders. The more we let people decide as humans what they want to do with their life, the less we pressure men, women and non binaries to adhere to gender expectations. We still think in boxes. </p><p>And this thinking in boxes leads some to the conclusion that Sansa could only be a <b>strong</b> female character if she learns to reject traditional feminity like Arya does. This is wrong. Sansa is already a strong woman. And why would you wish for her to 'learn her lesson\u2019 and to stay alone if this is not what she wants? I mean if you say that Sansa can only be a strong woman if she stays alone you are playing into the notion that a male coded behaviour and life is better. People who want Sansa to be less feminine fall into the trap of 'male is better than female\u2019. So, I\u2019m all for Sansa to learn that her ideas about happiness is not everybody\u2019s idea (we see the beginning of that in the Vale I think), but I\u2019m also on board for Sansa to get her happy ending :  a husband who is brave, gentle and strong and a bunch of children. </p><p>I would argue that this is not faux feminism but real feminism. Do not put women into boxes. Let them have a choice. Stop the nonsense that only male coded behaviour is strong. Stop the nonsense that women can only be happy if they emulate men - and while we\u2019re at it we could do the men a favour and give them a choice as well. And we can start by respecting every choice and finally stop taking down female coded behaviour. </p><p>Thanks for the ask! I hope I got the gist of your question!</p>",

So, I\u2019d find it utterly disrespectful if D just strolls in there. I know the trailer showed a shot of Jon\u2019s back standing by the weirdwood tree. He could be talking to Bran, or Sansa/Arya may be approaching him to talk while he\u2019s brooding for guidance. If instead of Sansa/Arya/Bran, it\u2019s D approaching him, that\u2019ll just be extremely annoying for me. Insert her into the Stark chair or the crypts, but dont fucking bring her into the Godswood, D&amp;D. She definitely doesn\u2019t belong there. Rant over. </p>",
