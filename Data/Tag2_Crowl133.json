this one, I\u2019m seriously so happy with it, despite the angst.\u00a0 XD</b></p><p>The day was meant to have been won, everyone was safe and\nfine and, for once, uninjured. \u00a0It all\nfelt so normal and Crowley had actually been stunned when they thanked him for\nhis help. \u00a0You\u2019d beamed at him so\nbrightly that Crowley would have done anything in that moment if you\u2019d asked\nhim too, pride swelling in his chest.</p><p>Then, in just a heartbeat, the world shattered.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t even a cry, just a small blinking moment and\nyou were staring at the silver blade jutting from out of your chest.</p><!-- more --><p>Chaos instantly erupted as further fighting ensued, and it\nwasn\u2019t until it was over, truly over this time, that all attention turned back\nto you.</p><p>Castiel was there was first, but even as he reached for you,\nhis hand was hesitant and Crowley\u2019s world seemed to stop.</p><p>Castiel\u2019s hand rested over your eyes and he swallowed\nheavily, looking at each of them in turn and telling them what they already\nknew. \u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Crowley shut down, he couldn\u2019t, he wouldn\u2019t face your death,\nnot like this, not with these three here, and without even a second thought, he\nvanished. \u00a0There would be no deal made\nfor you, no coming back, you\u2019d made him promise that.</p><p>It felt so long ago now, the words so meaningless at the\ntime, but Crowley had promised you and he\u2019d sworn long before you both properly\ncommitted to each other that you would be the one that he would never break a\npromise.</p><p>Back in Hell, the demons knew instantly that something was\nwrong and left him alone. \u00a0Crowley went\nstraight for his whiskey and poured himself a larger glass than normal, let the\nburn affect him as it went down his throat, anything to feel something else\nbesides what he was.</p><p>His chest was constricting, his lungs struggling to take in\nair, and even though he didn\u2019t need it, it scared him. \u00a0It scared him because it meant what he\nalready knew, was true.</p><p>He loved you.</p><p>The glass shattered in his hand and he lent heavily on his\ndesk, fighting for air, fighting to keep himself in control.</p><p>He loved you and now he was never going to see you again.</p><p>Crowley glared furiously at his hands as hot tears dripped\ndown onto them. \u00a0The more he tried to\nblink them away, the worse they seemed to get, and with a roar, he jammed his\neyes shut and let go.</p><p>No one dared ask the King about the scream that filled Hell\nthat day, that was powerful enough to make the Hell Hounds cower in their cages. \u00a0They all knew that if that something had\nupset the King that much, it would mean

Castiel said rather firmly. \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve been avoiding us.\u201d</p><p>Crowley shrugged. \n\u201cSo? \u00a0It\u2019s not like we were all\nbest of pals or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all felt Y/N\u2019s loss Crowley-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d \u00a0Crowley\nsnapped sharply. \u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t get to speak\nher name, not to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it hurts, I

is in included in that, you\u2019re\nsucceeding.\u201d \u00a0Crowley growls, a drink\nappearing in his hand as he sits heavily in his chair.</p><p>But Castiel\u2019s gaze remains sad. \u00a0\u201cI just wanted to ask you something first, if\nyou don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Crowley shoots him a dark look, but remains silent.</p><p>Castiel takes a breath. \n\u201cDid you know that Y/N would go to

left it at that.</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d Castiel said. \n\u201cNow, if you\u2019ll let me, I want to show you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing that you can show me that I want to

do this for\nme?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, even if I don\u2019t think you deserved Y/N, I still\nwant her to be happy.\u201d \u00a0Castiel said\ncarefully. \u00a0\u201cAnd I know she\u2019ll be happier\nin the knowledge that you are happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could she possibly know that now?\u201d \u00a0Crowley asked slowly. \u00a0\u201cShe is where I can never see her again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving you the option to do just that,\u201d Castiel\nsaid. \u00a0\u201cI want to show you what her\nHeaven is like.\u201d</p><p>Crowley stared at him, unsure, his heart racing as his mind worked\nand worried over the possibilities.</p><p>\u201cYou need this Crowley,\u201d Castiel said slowly. \u00a0\u201cEven if you won\u2019t admit that to yourself.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, resigning himself to whatever he was about to see. \u00a0\u201cAlright, let\u2019s get this over with.\u201d</p><p>Castiel steps cautiously forward and then rests his hand\nagainst Crowley\u2019s forehead.</p><p>The scene swam before him for a moment before he was stunned\nto find himself in his own bedroom, one that the two of your had shared on many\noccasion. \u00a0His heart leapt to his throat\nas he saw you there, curled up against what he guessed was a memory of him.</p><p>You sighed contently. \n<b>\u201c</b><b>Why are you always so warm?\u201d</b></p><p>The fake Crowley\nchuckled. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s the demon side of me,\nborn in hellfire and all that.\u201d</p><p>You looked at him in\na way that made Crowley\u2019s heart ache. \u00a0He\nmissed you, he missed you so much and there wasn\u2019t a damn thing that he could\ndo about it.</p><p>You laughed and\nplayfully poked fake Crowley\u2019s side. \n\u201cCome on, I\u2019m being serious!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I,\u201d Fake\nCrowley laughed, quickly capturing your hands as you go to poke him again. \u00a0\u201cWe can\u2019t just go around and pretend we\u2019re\ndead now, can we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are\nunbelievable,\u201d You shake your head, smiling, unsuccessfully trying to pull your\nhands away. \u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t even give me a\nsimple-ah!\u201d</p><p>Fake Crowley pinned\nyou beneath him, instantly setting you into giggles.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that\nlove?\u201d \u00a0Fake Crowley asked sweetly. \u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t quite get that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an-\u201d</p><p>He stopped you with\na kiss and Crowley had to force himself to look away, he could feel himself\nshaking, wanting it to stop, wanting to be him, the real him, there and\nnow. \u00a0Every part of him was cursing Sam\nand Dean and Castiel and himself; everything and anything else he could think\nof.</p><p>This just wasn\u2019t\nfair.</p><p>He heard you sigh. \u00a0\u201cI wish this was real Crowley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean\nlove?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Crowley looked up\nand saw the fake him vanish, you remaining still for a moment on the bed before\nsitting up, clothes reappearing around you.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing\nhere Cas?\u201d \u00a0You asked softly.</p><p>Castiel was standing\nawkwardly in the corner of the room. \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Y/N. \u00a0I just\u2026I wanted\nto see if you were happy.\u201d</p><p>Your smile was\nsad. \u00a0\u201cI am at peace, yes, but am I\nhappy? \u00a0No, and you know that, just as\nthey\u2019ve clearly told you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could bring you\nback?\u201d \u00a0Crowley glared at the memory of\nCastiel, a foul taste sitting in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou know you\ncan\u2019t,\u201d You said. \u00a0\u201cYou know that there\u2019s\nno way back for me, not unless by some miracle, and even then\u2026\u201d You trailed off\nfor a moment and Crowley knew what was coming. \n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen what\u2019s done to Sam and Dean. \u00a0I don\u2019t want that Cas. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Castiel looks at her\nsadly. \u00a0\u201cIs there anything that I can do\nthen?\u201d</p><p>You licked your lips\nnervously and Crowley fidgeted, worried about what you would say.</p><p>\u201cI want you to\napologise to Crowley for me,\u201d You said quietly, making Crowley raise his\neyebrows. \u00a0\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have\u2026it\nshouldn\u2019t have ended so soon and not in the way it did, so caught off guard as\nwe were.\u201d \u00a0You give a bitter laugh. \u00a0\u201cMakes me still feel so foolish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could\u2019ve\nhappened to any of us Y/N,\u201d Castiel said. \n\u201cBut I will tell him.\u201d</p><p>You nod, but still\nlook like there\u2019s more you want to say.</p><p>\u201cY/N, I-I\u2019m afraid I\ncan\u2019t stay too much longer.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, you nod. \u00a0\u201cYeah\u2026this isn\u2019t easy.\u201d \u00a0You bury your hands in your pockets and rock\non your heels and Crowley realises that you are holding back tears. \u00a0\u201cJust tell him that I love him, okay? \u00a0That\u2026as much as this sucks\u2026I can live with\nit.\u201d \u00a0You give a choked laugh. \u00a0\u201cPoor choice of words, but you know what I\nmean, he may actually find it funny too.\u201d</p><p>Crowley found\nhimself smiling, something that he hadn\u2019t done in what felt like a very long\ntime.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s better than\nwhat everyone thinks,\u201d You continued softly. \n\u201cSo you and those two boys go easy on him. \u00a0For me.\u201d</p><p>Castiel nods,\ncausing Crowley to swallow. \u00a0You had\nalways been vocal when the boys made their dislike clear; he knew that it\nprobably wouldn\u2019t change anything, but as always, he was grateful that you said\nsomething.</p><p>\u201cAnd Cas,\u201d You\ncaught Castiel\u2019s attention as he goes to leave. \n\u201cHe won\u2019t want to hear it, but you tell him to keep going. \u00a0I don\u2019t want him to keep\u2026keep pining over me. \u00a0He deserves to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N\u2026\u201d</p><p>You wave a hand at\nhim, wiping the other quickly over your eyes to stop any tears. \u00a0\u201cI can cope with this, it\u2019s not perfect, but\nthen nothing ever has been. \u00a0Just\u2026tell\nhim those things, okay?\u201d</p><p>Castiel nods. \u00a0\u201cI promise Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d \u00a0You said quietly. \u00a0\u201cYou take care Cas. \u00a0Say\u2026say hi to everyone for me.\u201d</p><p>Castiel leaves and\nCrowley steps closer to you, his chest aching, reaching out for to cup your\ncheek as you remained watching the door.</p><p>Just as he swears\nthat he can feel you again, the memory crumbles and he\u2019s left back in Hell,\nCastiel stepping back away from him. \u00a0</p><p>Crowley\u2019s chest\nheaves as he fights to keep control of himself, not wanting the angel to see,\nalthough he knew that Castiel already knew.</p><p>\u201cFor what it\u2019s\nworth,\u201d Castiel spoke eventually. \u00a0\u201cI am\nsorry.\u201d</p><p>With a flutter of\nwings, Castiel vanished, leaving Crowley alone again with his grief, it rushing\nup again in waves to the surface, feeling like he lost you again.</p><p>For a long time\nafter that, Crowley thought heavily. \u00a0He\nfinally allowed contact again with the Winchester\u2019s and Castiel, but he kept it\nto a minimum, memories still too painful, and he couldn\u2019t stand the occasional\npity that he caught in their gazes.</p><p>He was the King of\nHell dammit, he wasn\u2019t meant to be like this. \nHe was meant to be ruthless and fierce and powerful, he certainly wasn\u2019t\nmeant to be in league with hunters and angels, not unless it benefited him, and\nhe certainly wasn\u2019t meant to have fallen in love with a human, that wasn\u2019t meant\nto be something that the King of Hell did.</p><p>It hit him then,\neven though it had been mulling away in the back of his mind for ages, the\nweight of it all hit him and he suddenly felt very tired.</p><p>He hated this. \u00a0He hated being the King of Hell, hated always\nhaving to watch his back as other demons fought for the position, fought to\nalways be that bit closer to the top. \u00a0He\nhated always being seen as the bad guy, and while, for a long time there, he\nmost certainly was, Crowley knew that he had changed, knew that there was more\nto his life than just black and white.</p><p>The sudden urge to\nfix things washed over him and memories that he thought he had pushed well away\nreturned, making him swallow, making him wonder whether he could do it, making\nhim wonder if he could be redeemed in such a way.</p><p>Crowley frowned to\nhimself.</p><p>When had he ever not\ndone something that he put his mind to? \nEven if this took him centuries upon centuries, whether he had to go\nthrough Hell many times to get there, he was going to do it.</p><p>Without a second\nthought, he snapped into the bunker, making Sam and Dean jump and curse at him.</p><p>But Crowley shakes\nhis head at them, not in the mood for the usual banter, his mind made up. \u00a0\u201cBoys, I want you to do something for me, no\nquestions asked, you may even find it preferable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat Crowley?\u201d \u00a0Dean asked, his tone exasperated as he sat\nback down heavily in his chair. \u00a0\u201cYou\nalways want something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you are one to\ntalk.\u201d \u00a0Crowley snapped briefly, but\nshakes his head with a sigh. \u00a0\u201cTrust me\nwhen I say I have thought long and hard about it and that I am indeed serious\nabout my decision and well aware of the consequences.\u201d</p><p>Sam and Dean share a\nlook, if Crowley wasn\u2019t mistaken, worry flashed across their expressions, but\nSam cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Crowley took a deep\nbreath, finally letting himself relax. \nFinally let himself hope again. \n\u201cI want you to make me human.\u201d</p>",

blade jutting from out of your chest.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Chaos instantly erupted as further fighting ensued, and it\nwasn\u2019t until it was over, truly over this time, that all attention turned back\nto you.</p><p>Castiel was there was first, but even as he reached for you,\nhis hand was hesitant and Crowley\u2019s world seemed to stop.</p><p>Castiel\u2019s hand rested over your eyes and he swallowed\nheavily, looking at each of them in turn and telling them what they already\nknew. \u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Crowley shut down, he couldn\u2019t, he wouldn\u2019t face your death,\nnot like this, not with these three here, and without even a second thought, he\nvanished. \u00a0There would be no deal made\nfor you, no coming back, you\u2019d made him promise that.</p><p>It felt so long ago now, the words so meaningless at the\ntime, but Crowley had promised you and he\u2019d sworn long before you both properly\ncommitted to each other that you would be the one that he would never break a\npromise.</p><p>Back in Hell, the demons knew instantly that something was\nwrong and left him alone. \u00a0Crowley went\nstraight for his whiskey and poured himself a larger glass than normal, let the\nburn affect him as it went down his throat, anything to feel something else\nbesides what he was.</p><p>His chest was constricting, his lungs struggling to take in\nair, and even though he didn\u2019t need it, it scared him. \u00a0It scared him because it meant what he\nalready knew, was true.</p><p>He loved you.</p><p>The glass shattered in his hand and he lent heavily on his\ndesk, fighting for air, fighting to keep himself in control.</p><p>He loved you and now he was never going to see you again.</p><p>Crowley glared furiously at his hands as hot tears dripped\ndown onto them. \u00a0The more he tried to\nblink them away, the worse they seemed to get, and with a roar, he jammed his\neyes shut and let go.</p><p>No one dared ask the King about the scream that filled Hell\nthat day, that was powerful enough to make the Hell Hounds cower in their cages. \u00a0They all knew that if that something had\nupset the King that much, it would mean instant death for them.</p><p>For a long time, Crowley refused any contact with the Winchester\u2019s\nor Castiel, the thought of seeing them was too much of a painful reminder of\nyou, of what he lost, of what he\u2019d been so close to having.</p><p>To what he thought a demon was never capable of doing.</p><p>It had been so long in fact that he was actually stunned\nwhen he came into his

heart racing as his mind worked\nand worried over the possibilities.</p><p>\u201cYou need this Crowley,\u201d Castiel said slowly. \u00a0\u201cEven if you won\u2019t admit that to

we\u2019re\ndead now, can we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are\nunbelievable,\u201d You shake your head, smiling, unsuccessfully trying to pull your\nhands away. \u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t even give me a\nsimple-ah!\u201d</p><p>Fake Crowley pinned\nyou beneath him, instantly setting you into giggles.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that\nlove?\u201d \u00a0Fake Crowley asked sweetly. \u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t quite get that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an-\u201d</p><p>He stopped you with\na kiss and Crowley had to force himself to look away, he could feel himself\nshaking, wanting it to stop, wanting to be him, the real him, there and\nnow. \u00a0Every part of him was cursing Sam\nand Dean and Castiel and himself; everything and anything else he could think\nof.</p><p>This just wasn\u2019t\nfair.</p><p>He heard you sigh. \u00a0\u201cI wish this was real Crowley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean\nlove?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Crowley looked up\nand saw the fake him vanish, you remaining still for a moment on the bed before\nsitting up, clothes reappearing around you.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing\nhere Cas?\u201d \u00a0You asked softly.</p><p>Castiel was standing\nawkwardly in the corner of the room. \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Y/N. \u00a0I just\u2026I wanted\nto see if you were happy.\u201d</p><p>Your smile was\nsad. \u00a0\u201cI am at peace, yes, but am I\nhappy? \u00a0No, and you know that, just as\nthey\u2019ve clearly told you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could bring you\nback?\u201d \u00a0Crowley glared at the memory of\nCastiel, a foul taste sitting in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou know you\ncan\u2019t,\u201d You said. \u00a0\u201cYou know that there\u2019s\nno way back for me, not unless by some miracle, and even then\u2026\u201d You trailed off\nfor a moment and Crowley knew what was coming. \n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen what\u2019s done to Sam and Dean. \u00a0I don\u2019t want that Cas. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Castiel looks at her\nsadly. \u00a0\u201cIs there anything that I can do\nthen?\u201d</p><p>You licked your lips\nnervously and Crowley fidgeted, worried about what you would say.</p><p>\u201cI want you to\napologise to Crowley for me,\u201d You said quietly, making Crowley raise his\neyebrows. \u00a0\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have\u2026it\nshouldn\u2019t have ended so soon and not in the way it did, so caught off guard as\nwe were.\u201d \u00a0You give a bitter laugh. \u00a0\u201cMakes me still feel so foolish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could\u2019ve\nhappened to any of us Y/N,\u201d Castiel said. \n\u201cBut I will tell him.\u201d</p><p>You nod, but still\nlook like there\u2019s more you want to say.</p><p>\u201cY/N, I-I\u2019m afraid I\ncan\u2019t stay too much longer.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, you nod. \u00a0\u201cYeah\u2026this isn\u2019t easy.\u201d \u00a0You bury your hands in your pockets and rock\non your heels and Crowley realises that you are holding back tears. \u00a0\u201cJust tell him that I love him, okay? \u00a0That\u2026as much as this sucks\u2026I can live with\nit.\u201d \u00a0You give a choked laugh. \u00a0\u201cPoor choice of words, but you know what I\nmean, he may actually find it funny too.\u201d</p><p>Crowley found\nhimself smiling, something that he hadn\u2019t done in what felt like a very long\ntime.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s better than\nwhat everyone thinks,\u201d You continued softly. \n\u201cSo you and those two boys go easy on him. \u00a0For me.\u201d</p><p>Castiel nods,\ncausing Crowley to swallow. \u00a0You had\nalways been vocal when the boys made their dislike clear; he knew that it\nprobably wouldn\u2019t change anything, but as always, he was grateful that you said\nsomething.</p><p>\u201cAnd Cas,\u201d You\ncaught Castiel\u2019s attention as he goes to leave. \n\u201cHe won\u2019t want to hear it, but you tell him to keep going. \u00a0I don\u2019t want him to keep\u2026keep pining over me. \u00a0He deserves to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N\u2026\u201d</p><p>You wave a hand at\nhim, wiping the other quickly over your eyes to stop any tears. \u00a0\u201cI can cope with this, it\u2019s not perfect, but\nthen nothing ever has been. \u00a0Just\u2026tell\nhim those things, okay?\u201d</p><p>Castiel nods. \u00a0\u201cI promise Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d \u00a0You said quietly. \u00a0\u201cYou take care Cas. \u00a0Say\u2026say hi to everyone for me.\u201d</p><p>Castiel leaves and\nCrowley steps closer to you, his chest aching, reaching out for to cup your\ncheek as you remained watching the door.</p><p>Just as he swears\nthat he can feel you again, the memory crumbles and he\u2019s left back in Hell,\nCastiel stepping back away from him. \u00a0</p><p>Crowley\u2019s chest\nheaves as he fights to keep control of himself, not wanting the angel to see,\nalthough he knew that Castiel already knew.</p><p>\u201cFor what it\u2019s\nworth,\u201d Castiel spoke eventually. \u00a0\u201cI am\nsorry.\u201d</p><p>With a flutter of\nwings, Castiel vanished, leaving Crowley alone again with his grief, it rushing\nup again in waves to the surface, feeling like he lost you again.</p><p>For a long time\nafter that, Crowley thought heavily. \u00a0He\nfinally allowed contact again with the Winchester\u2019s and Castiel, but he kept it\nto a minimum, memories still too painful, and he couldn\u2019t stand the occasional\npity that he caught in their gazes.</p><p>He was the King of\nHell dammit, he wasn\u2019t meant to be like this. \nHe was meant to be ruthless and fierce and powerful, he certainly wasn\u2019t\nmeant to be in league with hunters and angels, not unless it benefited him, and\nhe certainly wasn\u2019t meant to have fallen in love with a human, that wasn\u2019t meant\nto be something that the King of Hell did.</p><p>It hit him then,\neven though it had been mulling away in the back of his mind for ages, the\nweight of it all hit him and he suddenly felt very tired.</p><p>He hated this. \u00a0He hated being the King of Hell, hated always\nhaving to watch his back as other demons fought for the position, fought to\nalways be that bit closer to the top. \u00a0He\nhated always being seen as the bad guy, and while, for a long time there, he\nmost certainly was, Crowley knew that he had changed, knew that there was more\nto his life than just black and white.</p><p>The sudden urge to\nfix things washed over him and memories that he thought he had pushed well away\nreturned, making him swallow, making him wonder whether he could do it, making\nhim wonder if he could be redeemed in such a way.</p><p>Crowley frowned to\nhimself.</p><p>When had he ever not\ndone something that he put his mind to? \nEven if this took him centuries upon centuries, whether he had to go\nthrough Hell many times to get there, he was going to do it.</p><p>Without a second\nthought, he snapped into the bunker, making Sam and Dean jump and curse at him.</p><p>But Crowley shakes\nhis head at them, not in the mood for the usual banter, his mind made up. \u00a0\u201cBoys, I want you to do something for me, no\nquestions asked, you may even find it preferable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat Crowley?\u201d \u00a0Dean asked, his tone exasperated as he sat\nback down heavily in his chair. \u00a0\u201cYou\nalways want something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you are one to\ntalk.\u201d \u00a0Crowley snapped briefly, but\nshakes his head with a sigh. \u00a0\u201cTrust me\nwhen I say I have thought long and hard about it and that I am indeed serious\nabout my decision and well aware of the consequences.\u201d</p><p>Sam and Dean share a\nlook, if Crowley wasn\u2019t mistaken, worry flashed across their expressions, but\nSam cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Crowley took a deep\nbreath, finally letting himself relax. \nFinally let himself hope again. \n\u201cI want you to make me human.\u201d</p>",

target=\"_blank\">@gettinjoyful</a></b></p><p><b>Words: 2334</b></p><p><b>Warnings:\u00a0 This is angst, pure, pure angst.\u00a0 Reader death if that explains it.</b></p><p><b>I would love feedback on this one, I\u2019m seriously so happy with it, despite the angst.\u00a0 XD</b></p><p>The day was meant to have been won, everyone was safe and\nfine and, for once, uninjured. \u00a0It all\nfelt so normal and Crowley had actually been stunned when they thanked him for\nhis help. \u00a0You\u2019d beamed at him so\nbrightly that Crowley would have done anything in that moment if you\u2019d asked\nhim too, pride swelling in his chest.</p><p>Then, in just a heartbeat, the world shattered.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t even a cry, just a small blinking moment and\nyou were staring at the silver blade jutting from out of your chest.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Chaos instantly erupted as further fighting ensued, and it\nwasn\u2019t until it was over, truly over this time, that all attention turned back\nto you.</p><p>Castiel was there was first, but even as he reached for you,\nhis hand was hesitant and Crowley\u2019s world seemed to stop.</p><p>Castiel\u2019s hand rested over your eyes and he swallowed\nheavily, looking at each of them in turn and telling them what they already\nknew. \u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Crowley shut down, he couldn\u2019t, he wouldn\u2019t face your death,\nnot like this, not with these three here, and without even a second thought, he\nvanished. \u00a0There would be no deal made\nfor you, no coming back, you\u2019d made him promise that.</p><p>It felt so long ago now, the words so meaningless at the\ntime, but Crowley had promised you and he\u2019d sworn long before you both properly\ncommitted to each other that you would be the one that he would never break a\npromise.</p><p>Back in Hell, the demons knew instantly that something was\nwrong and left him alone. \u00a0Crowley went\nstraight for his whiskey and poured himself a larger glass than normal, let the\nburn affect him as it went down his throat, anything to feel something else\nbesides what he was.</p><p>His chest was constricting, his lungs struggling to take in\nair, and even though he didn\u2019t need it, it scared him. \u00a0It scared him because it meant what he\nalready knew, was true.</p><p>He loved you.</p><p>The glass shattered in his hand and he lent heavily on his\ndesk, fighting for air, fighting to keep himself in control.</p><p>He loved you and now he was never going to see you again.</p><p>Crowley glared furiously at his hands as hot tears dripped\ndown onto them. \u00a0The more he tried to\nblink them away, the worse they seemed to get, and with a roar, he jammed his\neyes shut and let go.</p><p>No one dared ask the King about the scream that filled Hell\nthat day, that was powerful enough to make the Hell Hounds cower in their cages. \u00a0They all knew that if that something had\nupset the King that much, it would mean instant death for them.</p><p>For a long time, Crowley refused any contact with the Winchester\u2019s\nor Castiel, the thought of seeing them was too much of a painful reminder of\nyou, of what he lost, of what he\u2019d been so close to having.</p><p>To what he thought a demon was never capable of doing.</p><p>It had been so long in fact that he was actually stunned\nwhen he came into his office to find Castiel sitting there, waiting for him.</p><p>\u201cAnd here I was thinking that it was just me avoiding\npleasantries,\u201d He said. \u00a0\u201cGet out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Castiel said rather firmly. \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve been avoiding us.\u201d</p><p>Crowley shrugged. \n\u201cSo? \u00a0It\u2019s not like we were all\nbest of pals or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all felt Y/N\u2019s loss Crowley-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d \u00a0Crowley\nsnapped sharply. \u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t get to speak\nher name, not to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it hurts, I know.\u201d \nCastiel\u2019s gaze was sympathetic. \n\u201cWe all knew what the two of you had. \nI was the one that convinced Sam and Dean to not say anything, no matter\nhow much they didn\u2019t approve-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care Castiel. \nGet out.\u201d</p><p>Castiel holds up his hands. \n\u201cI will, but not until I do what I came here for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if annoying me is in included in that, you\u2019re\nsucceeding.\u201d \u00a0Crowley growls, a drink\nappearing in his hand as he sits heavily in his chair.</p><p>But Castiel\u2019s gaze remains sad. \u00a0\u201cI just wanted to ask you something first, if\nyou don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Crowley shoots him a dark look, but remains silent.</p><p>Castiel takes a breath. \n\u201cDid you know that Y/N would go to Heaven when she died?\u201d</p><p>Crowley blanched, quickly looking away. \u00a0\u201cWhat of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you try and bring her back?\u201d</p><p>He stares at the drink in his hand. \u00a0\u201cI promised her I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you kept that promise?\u201d \nCastiel\u2019s tone was surprised.</p><p>\u201cOf course I bloody did!\u201d \nCrowley snapped. \u00a0\u201cThis is Y/N we\nare talking about!\u201d</p><p>Castiel shrugs. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t seem your nature Crowley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was Y/N.\u201d \u00a0He said\nquietly and left it at that.</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d Castiel said. \n\u201cNow, if you\u2019ll let me, I want to show you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing that you can show me that I want to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if it\u2019s Y/N?\u201d</p><p>Crowley\u2019s drink paused halfway to his lips as he stares at\nthe angel. \u00a0Slowly, he lowers the\nglass. \u00a0\u201cAnd why would you do this for\nme?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, even if I don\u2019t think you deserved Y/N, I still\nwant her to be happy.\u201d \u00a0Castiel said\ncarefully. \u00a0\u201cAnd I know she\u2019ll be happier\nin the knowledge that you are happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could she possibly know that now?\u201d \u00a0Crowley asked slowly. \u00a0\u201cShe is where I can never see her again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving you the option to do just that,\u201d Castiel\nsaid. \u00a0\u201cI want to show you what her\nHeaven is like.\u201d</p><p>Crowley stared at him, unsure, his heart racing as his mind worked\nand worried over the possibilities.</p><p>\u201cYou need this Crowley,\u201d Castiel said slowly. \u00a0\u201cEven if you won\u2019t admit that to yourself.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, resigning himself to whatever he was about to see. \u00a0\u201cAlright, let\u2019s get this over with.\u201d</p><p>Castiel steps cautiously forward and then rests his hand\nagainst Crowley\u2019s forehead.</p><p>The scene swam before him for a moment before he was stunned\nto find himself in his own bedroom, one that the two of your had shared on many\noccasion. \u00a0His heart leapt to his throat\nas he saw you there, curled up against what he guessed was a memory of him.</p><p>You sighed contently. \n<b>\u201c</b><b>Why are you always so warm?\u201d</b></p><p>The fake Crowley\nchuckled. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s the demon side of me,\nborn in hellfire and all that.\u201d</p><p>You looked at him in\na way that made Crowley\u2019s heart ache. \u00a0He\nmissed you, he missed you so much and there wasn\u2019t a damn thing that he could\ndo about it.</p><p>You laughed and\nplayfully poked fake Crowley\u2019s side. \n\u201cCome on, I\u2019m being serious!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I,\u201d Fake\nCrowley laughed, quickly capturing your hands as you go to poke him again. \u00a0\u201cWe can\u2019t just go around and pretend we\u2019re\ndead now, can we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are\nunbelievable,\u201d You shake your head, smiling, unsuccessfully trying to pull your\nhands away. \u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t even give me a\nsimple-ah!\u201d</p><p>Fake Crowley pinned\nyou beneath him, instantly setting you into giggles.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that\nlove?\u201d \u00a0Fake Crowley asked sweetly. \u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t quite get that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an-\u201d</p><p>He stopped you with\na kiss and Crowley had to force himself to look away, he could feel himself\nshaking, wanting it to stop, wanting to be him, the real him, there and\nnow. \u00a0Every part of him was cursing Sam\nand Dean and Castiel and himself; everything and anything else he could think\nof.</p><p>This just wasn\u2019t\nfair.</p><p>He heard you sigh. \u00a0\u201cI wish this was real Crowley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean\nlove?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Crowley looked up\nand saw the fake him vanish, you remaining still for a moment on the bed before\nsitting up, clothes reappearing around you.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing\nhere Cas?\u201d \u00a0You asked softly.</p><p>Castiel was standing\nawkwardly in the corner of the room. \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Y/N. \u00a0I just\u2026I wanted\nto see if you were happy.\u201d</p><p>Your smile was\nsad. \u00a0\u201cI am at peace, yes, but am I\nhappy? \u00a0No, and you know that, just as\nthey\u2019ve clearly told you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could bring you\nback?\u201d \u00a0Crowley glared at the

Castiel said slowly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Even if you won&rsquo;t admit that to yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>He sighed, resigning himself to whatever he was about to see. &nbsp;&ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s get this over with.&rdquo;</p><p>Castiel steps cautiously forward and then rests his hand\nagainst Crowley&rsquo;s forehead.</p><p>The scene swam before him for a moment before he was stunned\nto find himself in his own bedroom, one that the two of your had shared on many\noccasion. &nbsp;His heart leapt to his throat\nas he saw you there, curled up against what he guessed was a memory of him.</p><p>You sighed contently. \n<b>&ldquo;</b><b>Why are you always so warm?&rdquo;</b></p><p>The fake Crowley\nchuckled. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the demon side of me,\nborn in hellfire and all that.&rdquo;</p><p>You looked at him in\na way that made Crowley&rsquo;s heart ache. &nbsp;He\nmissed you, he missed you so much and there wasn&rsquo;t a damn thing that he could\ndo about it.</p><p>You laughed and\nplayfully poked fake Crowley&rsquo;s side. \n&ldquo;Come on, I&rsquo;m being serious!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo;

&nbsp;That&hellip;as much as this sucks&hellip;I can live with\nit.&rdquo; &nbsp;You give a choked laugh. &nbsp;&ldquo;Poor choice of words, but you know what I\nmean, he may actually find it funny too.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley found\nhimself smiling, something that he hadn&rsquo;t done in what felt like a very long\ntime.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s better than\nwhat everyone thinks,&rdquo; You continued softly. \n&ldquo;So you and those two boys go easy on him. &nbsp;For me.&rdquo;</p><p>Castiel nods,\ncausing Crowley to swallow. &nbsp;You had\nalways been vocal when the boys made their dislike clear; he knew that it\nprobably wouldn&rsquo;t change anything, but as always, he was grateful that you said\nsomething.</p><p>&ldquo;And Cas,&rdquo; You\ncaught Castiel&rsquo;s attention as he goes to leave. \n&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t want to hear it, but you tell him to keep going. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t want him to keep&hellip;keep pining over me. &nbsp;He deserves to be happy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>You wave a hand at\nhim, wiping the other quickly over your eyes to stop any tears. &nbsp;&ldquo;I can cope with this, it&rsquo;s not perfect, but\nthen nothing ever has been. &nbsp;Just&hellip;tell\nhim those things, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>Castiel nods. &nbsp;&ldquo;I promise Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; &nbsp;You said quietly. &nbsp;&ldquo;You take care Cas. &nbsp;Say&hellip;say hi to everyone for me.&rdquo;</p><p>Castiel leaves and\nCrowley steps closer to you, his chest aching, reaching out for to cup your\ncheek as you remained watching the door.</p><p>Just as he swears\nthat he can feel you again, the memory crumbles and he&rsquo;s left back in Hell,\nCastiel stepping back away from him. &nbsp;</p><p>Crowley&rsquo;s chest\nheaves as he fights to keep control of himself, not wanting the angel to see,\nalthough he knew that Castiel already knew.</p><p>&ldquo;For what it&rsquo;s\nworth,&rdquo; Castiel spoke eventually. &nbsp;&ldquo;I am\nsorry.&rdquo;</p><p>With a flutter of\nwings, Castiel vanished, leaving Crowley alone again with his grief, it rushing\nup again in waves to the surface, feeling like he lost you again.</p><p>For a long time\nafter that, Crowley thought heavily. &nbsp;He\nfinally allowed contact again with the Winchester&rsquo;s and Castiel, but he kept it\nto a minimum, memories still too painful, and he couldn&rsquo;t stand the occasional\npity that he caught in their gazes.</p><p>He was the King of\nHell dammit, he wasn&rsquo;t meant to be like this. \nHe was meant to be ruthless and fierce and powerful, he certainly wasn&rsquo;t\nmeant to be in league with hunters and angels, not unless it benefited him, and\nhe certainly wasn&rsquo;t meant to have fallen in love with a human, that wasn&rsquo;t meant\nto be something that the King of Hell did.</p><p>It hit him then,\neven though it had been mulling away in the back of his mind for ages, the\nweight of it all hit him and he suddenly felt very tired.</p><p>He hated this. &nbsp;He hated being the King of Hell, hated always\nhaving to watch his back as other demons fought for the position, fought to\nalways be that bit closer to the top. &nbsp;He\nhated always being seen as the bad guy, and while, for a long time there, he\nmost certainly was, Crowley knew that he had changed, knew that there was more\nto his life than just black and white.</p><p>The sudden urge to\nfix things washed over him and memories that he thought he had pushed well away\nreturned, making him swallow, making him wonder whether he could do it, making\nhim wonder if he could be redeemed in such a way.</p><p>Crowley frowned to\nhimself.</p><p>When had he ever not\ndone something that he put his mind to?
