His feet sprawled out, and his ankle caught the bed of the wheel. His head met the tile with a loud crack, jolting his already headache to come back with prominence. Blood started to ooze down the right side of his face from his eyebrow as Peter made his hand into a fist and struck the floor over and over again until he finally felt tiny pieces of bone underneath his flesh.</i></p><p><i>Peter curled his trembling body the best he could into a ball, his head rested against the floor as tears rolled down his flushed cheeks. His breathing uneven while he brought his broken hand up to his mouth to stop the wails from echoing down the hallway. Sirens and red emergency lights going off above him, but none of it mattered.</i></p><p><i>For everything was falling apart around him, and Peter could not stop it.</i></p><!-- more --><p>taglist:<i>

His feet sprawled out, and his ankle caught the bed of the wheel. His head met the tile with a loud crack, jolting his already headache to come back with prominence. Blood started to ooze down the right side of his face from his eyebrow as Peter made his hand into a fist and struck the floor over and over again until he finally felt tiny pieces of bone underneath his flesh.</i></p><p><i>Peter curled his trembling body the best he could into a ball, his head rested against the floor as tears rolled down his flushed cheeks. His breathing uneven while he brought his broken hand up to his mouth to stop the wails from echoing down the hallway. Sirens and red emergency lights going off above him, but none of it mattered.</i></p><p><i>For everything was falling apart around him, and Peter could not stop it.</i></p>[[MORE]]<p>taglist:<i> <a

His feet sprawled out, and his ankle caught the bed of the wheel. His head met the tile with a loud crack, jolting his already headache to come back with prominence. Blood started to ooze down the right side of his face from his eyebrow as Peter made his hand into a fist and struck the floor over and over again until he finally felt tiny pieces of bone underneath his flesh.</i></p><p><i>Peter curled his trembling body the best he could into a ball, his head rested against the floor as tears rolled down his flushed cheeks. His breathing uneven while he brought his broken hand up to his mouth to stop the wails from echoing down the hallway. Sirens and red emergency lights going off above him, but none of it mattered.</i></p><p><i>For everything was falling apart around him, and Peter could not stop it.</i></p><p>taglist:<i> <a

His feet sprawled out, and his ankle caught the bed of the wheel. His head met the tile with a loud crack, jolting his already headache to come back with prominence. Blood started to ooze down the right side of his face from his eyebrow as Peter made his hand into a fist and struck the floor over and over again until he finally felt tiny pieces of bone underneath his flesh.</i></p>\n<p><i>Peter curled his trembling body the best he could into a ball, his head rested against the floor as tears rolled down his flushed cheeks. His breathing uneven while he brought his broken hand up to his mouth to stop the wails from echoing down the hallway. Sirens and red emergency lights going off above him, but none of it mattered.</i></p>\n<p><i>For everything was falling apart around him, and Peter could not stop it.</i></p>\n</p>",

You do not hear Aunt May\u2019s sobs nor Mr. Stark\u2019s apologies. You do not hear the thoughts of your neighbors, how they had lost their daughter to the snap, or the thoughts of those living in the building beside yours, or the one beside that, or the thoughts of those in the next city.</p><p>In this agonizingly short moment, all you can hear is Mr. Stark\u2019s voice ringing in your head.</p><p><i>\u201cI\u2026the kid\u2026Peter\u2026I couldn\u2019t save Peter. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</i></p><p>You knew this. God, did you know this.</p><p>You were there, you were<i> in</i> Peter\u2019s head when it happened and yet some part of you still hoped that you were wrong, that the distance between Wakanda and whatever planet he was on was so great that although you were able to reach him, <i>finally</i> reach him, you had misunderstood what you had seen, what you had felt.</p><p>Mr. Stark had miraculously returned to Earth two days ago and there was no news about Spider-Man being with him on the ship. No Peter Parker.</p><p>The ugly vase Aunt May is so very fond of shatters and you come to your senses. Mr. Stark is in front of you, he probably should not be exerting the effort to get to your level, look you in the eye, but here he is, all skin and bones and haunted eyes. Aunt May has her hand over her chest, shocked by your powers destroying her vase, but she does not say anything.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Mr. Stark says, mouth slightly quirking upward out of habit.</p><p>\u201c\u2026hey,\u201d you say and although you really did not want to, you peaked into his mind.</p><p>You never thought that you would witness someone having a moon thrown at them.</p><p>Mr. Stark brings you out of his thoughts as quickly as you entered them.</p><p>\u201cSaw what you wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fought hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot hard enough.\u201d</p><p>You shake your head. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p><p>And you truly believe this. Although you really want to blame someone (and of course you can blame Thanos but he is not around to shout at) you cannot bring yourself to hate Mr. Stark.</p><p>Mr. Stark nods his head and you do not need to read his mind to know that he carries Peter\u2019s death on his shoulders. You know that he wants you to blame him, probably why he let you in his head with no complaints.</p><p>You place your hand on top of his and you push the thought of him being too skinny to the back of your mind. You focus on making sure your smile reaches your eyes and you try to calm Mr. Stark\u2019s mind to the best of your abilities.</p><p>\u201cThanks for being there for him.\u201d</p><p>\u2026</p><p><i>1 Month After the Decimation</i></p><p>Aunt May never thought going to the grocery would be a surreal experience. She had gotten used to waiting in long lines and conversing with the cashiers at the checkout line but ever since\u2026well, that, life has been different. It was hard finding out her favorite cashier had disappeared along with many others but Aunt May managed. When half the population\u2014when your<i> family</i> disappears in the blink of an eye and you do not even have the chance to be with them when that happens, you do not have any choice but to manage</p><p>Aunt May barely manages to adjust the grocery bags in her arm to free up her hand when you slam the door open, staring up at her, breathing heavily as if you had just run a marathon. Aunt May looks down at you, surprised, and everything clicks in her mind and she figures out why tears are welling up in your eyes.</p><p>\u201cI just needed to get some ingredients,\u201d she tells you, using her free hand to smooth your hair. \u201cI left you a message.\u201d</p><p>You look down at your feet, digging your phone out of your back pocket. You press a button, but your screen does not light up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026forgot to charge my phone,\u201d you say, voice small. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, sweetie. I should have left a note somewhere, too. I\u2019ll be careful.\u201d</p><p>Aunt May gives you a smile that <i>does</i> reach her tired eyes and you feel guilt settle heavily in your stomach. You hate that you made Aunt May feel bad about leaving her own apartment but you could not help but panic when you woke up from your trance and could not find her anywhere.</p><p>It has been a weak since Tony Stark has come back down to Earth and ever since he has confirmed that Peter had indeed been a victim to Thano\u2019s snap, you could not help but go into some kind of shock. You tried to stay strong that day, tried not to breakdown in front of Mr. Stark, but once his too thin form walked out the door, you felt your world crumble.</p><p>Mr. Stark, an actual <i>hero</i>, lost.</p><p>You knew that happened. You were there with the rest of the Avengers when they lost, when<i> you</i> lost, but for some reason Mr. Stark\u2019s loss hit you harder. Took the wind out of your lungs and practically stopped your heart.</p><p>You have spent most of your days staring at the ceiling, sometimes just lying down on the sofa or floating in the middle of the living room, listening to the thoughts of everyone in your telepathic radius.</p><p>You have felt nothing but anger and anguish since the snap, your mind filled with the thoughts of everyone around you, mourning the loss of people you did not even know.</p><p>You wish that there was a way to turn off your thoughts, to find peace and quiet, but you are afraid of what is going to happen if you stop hearing everyone else.</p><p>You already know what it feels like to have your link with people severed, you do not think you can handle it happening again.</p><p>You do not want to be left alone again.</p><!-- more --><p>\u2026</p><p><i>6 Months After the Decimation</i></p><p>It took you longer than you thought it would but you congratulate yourself for making it this far. The X-Mansion looks exactly the same way it did when you ran away that night and yet, at the same time, it looks entirely different. You try not to dwell on the fact that it probably is because a lot of the people you knew are no longer there. That Professor X is not there to welcome and reprimand you.</p><p>You do not bother to knock on the door. Instead, you unlock it with your powers and you step in as quietly as you can. You feel like an outsider, which is honestly a feat in the X-Mansion, and you wonder if you should just turn back and act like you were never there. You almost completely convince yourself to abandon ship when Megan steps into view, looking at you as if you were a ghost.</p><p>She probably thought you were. You regret not answering any of her messages.</p><p>Megan brings you into the tightest hug you have ever had, tighter than the one Aunt May gave you\u2014something you did not think was possible. She has tears in her eyes but you know that it would be a cold day in hell before she ever let them fall. Instead, she tilts her head back and tries to blink her tears back into their ducts. You are not quite sure how she manages to do that.</p><p>She holds onto your arm as if you need guidance, bringing around the X-Mansion. She does not tell you about who are still in the building but you figure it out yourself soon enough. It is not that hard, seeing as Megan has a mental list of who had mysteriously disappeared that day. You are glad that your good friends are still around but you feel your heart sink when you realize that, along with Professor X, majority of the professors did not make it.</p><p>Alumni had volunteered to watch over the students who did not or could not return to their homes.</p><p>Megan seems to have naturally taken the role as the mansion\u2019s older sister, making sure that everything and everyone is okay, even those who have left to be with their families.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t there,\u201d you tell Megan when you both settle in the kitchen, preparing lunch. \u201cIt must have been tough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to come back,\u201d Megan says with a shrug of her shoulder. She gives you a smile when she sees you make a conflicted face. \u201cI knew why you had to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just glad you\u2019re still here.\u201d</p><p>You watch as Megan brings out a stack of plates and you help her by floating the food out the door along with the utensils. You follow Megan\u2019s orders, placing the plates where they need to be and you watch as she calls for people to come to the table. You stand in the corner, watching your fellow mutants trickle in and you try not to linger in their heads for too long.</p><p>You find nothing new in their minds, they think the same things people back at Queens do, but you feel something different from them.</p><p>A different feeling of loss.</p><p>You smile at familiar and unfamiliar faces and you hope you look at least half as put together as Megan does.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>You should not have wandered off on your own but Megan had to discuss some things with the alumni and you could not bear to be alone in the living room with everyone else. You walked up to yours and Megan\u2019s room, you<i> hope</i> that it is still your room, and find that Megan has left all your things untouched.</p><p>You see a thick layer of dust on your desk and you cannot help but think that Megan left it alone out of spite because you ghosted her.</p><p>You cannot exactly blame her.</p><p>You walked towards the window, looking out of it to appreciate the view when the memory of Peter swinging to you in the dead of night just to check up on you hits you hard.</p><p>You nearly tear the curtains off the rod when you fall to the floor.</p><p>You see him in front of your for just a second, see him dressed in his Spider-Man costume, mask held tightly in his hand. He is smiling down at you, just like he did that night. Without thinking, you reach your hand out to him, just to touch him, and he disappears from your sight. Just like that. As fast as you can snap your fingers.</p><p>Megan comes into the room seconds after that and she runs to your side, asking you what happened. You look at her, your eyes wide and your mind fuzzy, and you realize that you had accidentally used your powers to flip your entire bed over and smash your desk against the wall.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026I saw\u2026,\u201d you begin, not sure if what you saw was really there despite all the things you know. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Meg. I\u2019ll\u2026I\u2019ll fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u2026</p><p><i>1 Year and a Half After the Decimation</i></p><p>You definitely owe Mr. Stark an explanation but he does not ask for one. Instead, he has you sit in his dining room while he brings out fresh orange juice from his refrigerator. One of Pepper\u2019s newest and most successful projects was her orange tree. She is also growing lemons and herbs. You think she\u2019ll try grapes next month.</p><p>Mr. Stark offers you a glass and you take it without comment. He has his own glass and he drinks it eagerly.</p><p>\u201cThat hits the spot,\u201d Mr. Stark says with a sigh, leaning back. He gestures for you to drink yours and you take slow sips, staring holes into his table.</p><p>You should have probably told someone about the dark thoughts. You know that you could have told literally anyone that all the negative thoughts you and other people were having were causing you to spiral, make your powers go off. Somedays, you had little to no control over them. You had destroyed things, hurt people.</p><p>You were\u2014<i>are</i> afraid.</p><p>But you do not know who to turn to.</p><p>Megan is busy handling things at the X-Mansion and you do not want to worry Aunt May. She worries about your almost catatonic episodes enough. You do not want her to think about your dwindling control over your powers. You cannot bother anymore. She is slowly getting better, learning to become happy again despite everything. You tell yourself you will not destroy her progress.</p><p>You do destroy about five fire hydrants, the fire escape and water tank of your building, the road heading towards the X-Mansion, and a jungle gym. You also end up controlling people, having walk into posts and, on one occasion, make some guy on the street believe that he is actually a dog.</p><p>It took a while to reverse the damage but you do in time for Mr. Stark to pick you and bring you to his new house by the lake.</p><p>\u201cY\u2019know what I really wish I could do right now?\u201d Mr. Stark starts, startling you out of your thoughts. You look up at him and see him pointing at you, eyes full of wonder and interest. You keep silent, hoping he would continue without you saying anything. He does. \u201cI wish I had your powers right now.\u201d</p><p>You feel your brows shoot up. After everything that has happened? He wants your powers?</p><p>\u201cY\u2019see, Morgan, sweetest baby angel in the world, does not let me sleep,\u201d Mr. Stark says, voice barely above a whisper. You look at him questioningly and before you can even ask why he is suddenly being so quiet; you hear a baby\u2019s wail from another room.</p><p>\u201cAll baby\u2019s cry, Mr. Stark,\u201d you tell him.</p><p>\u201cI know that. I just want to know what\u2019s making her cry,\u201d Mr. Stark runs a hand through his hair. \u201cI know if she\u2019s hungry or if she wants to sleep but what about the other times? What if there is actually something really bothering her? I want to be able to fix it.\u201d</p><p>You are not quite sure what to say. Unfortunately, you baby crying knowledge is close to zilch. Everything your saying is purely based on what you have seen in TV and in movies.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026don\u2019t they cry for no reason sometimes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s why I said your powers would really come in handy. I want to know if that\u2019s the reason, too,\u201d Mr. Stark shrugs. \u201cI bet that mind calming thing you do would really come in handy at night.\u201d</p><p>You feel your cheeks warm. \u201cYou noticed that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a lot gets past me, kid.\u201d Mr. Stark gets up from his seat and pats you on your shoulder. You are not sure why but somehow the heavy weight of his hand comforts you. \u201cI\u2019m going to head over to the Squirt\u2019s room to help out. Wanna meet her?\u201d</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p><a href=\"https://minkamousewritesfic.tumblr.com/post/185809736451/its-hard-when-youre-young-peter-parker-x-reader\">Part 24: Home</a></p><p><i>\n\n&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-\n\n<br/></i></p><p><i>Taglist:</i></p><p><i><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIj52RC0XuSI6RcDC3_avug\">@xazu-ravenx</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8CmXuriy8t5caMStNuDaoQ\">@call-me-latte</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1P3msgsxO-Noc_jKlZKaPg\">@a-sunflower-sun</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbWnoS8kcQ-mmjGIamDWURg\">@duliz2014</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw4VjWrJEWr6WwBBMVBykcw\">@arisu003</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM6-8eMWNYB_AjTB244O1hQ\">@lilspacefreckles</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9jpsUIfZHmT4_9ISd-kVKQ\">@slideseok</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBTY7MShbhiNb3Hauh3PpZA\">@niiamh</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVRFoZYlCu8XDZ0nMvI8adw\">@intoomuchfandoms</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzisYX8eqaV2l0raAyirelA\">@naturallyspontaneous</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnEBBWEAS-ky9AAIvck1ezQ\">@jimenatateyama</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mo-MFXpt1YV2wmNXQw0C9gQ\">@le-yona</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnA0o4eAbx7J0wt3wIgliPQ\">@nicole-lynne</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGs7qK6Vo81-rq7k3q4tONA\">@clint-bartxn99</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1MfzScq_8L0AhximwRM8wg\">@kewl-r</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnoSxDk7r4DKrNxtGOj5jlw\">@autobotgirl15-blog</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8RopNrvvyXKaF265RSVNXw\">@peter-spider-parker-man</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfkPfAyQgusMXCuj6SCob5A\">@redgemsposts</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muvpc7UiYHeXGUf5LhZj3MA\">@shantayok</a> \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3fiyOXF_Q2PcFTV-Xi-2cg\">@throughlytired</a> \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNX5ZZN90g-LRU5oJlZg6AQ\">@sk-o-mp</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCSNlsBXojzIby9-m21lQTw\">@amb-q</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnJc3qUZdf4ThjsWqbDC1MQ\">@justfuxxingkillmealready</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjGA2SF0yjFFzEHVftwHPjg\">@spidey-quackson</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwBCr_bgyyEWgP4rzIVbOkQ\">@sketchcole</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJSpsgywe-IH9XI2oxhBqsQ\">@patat-boi</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWe-Gim3fCT58hc3c2V62yA\">@waywaya</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV155O6iryeIB1bzRvtXHXw\">@akira-0229</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFeag8NmH4_6GfQ2hXDmArg\">@yunggenoalpha</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mL5ioo93YPr5IXYLdpa_N9w\">@alina-margaret</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnGf32jLkXSykoj5olbM7hg\">@astromilku</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnqojvhOI5PW669I4MMuSKA\">@thewaywarddaughter1967</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msGaFxudFWLw_ENpXzP1AJQ\">@minetticatinwonderland</a> @<a href=\"https://softcrybabyboy.tumblr.com/\" title=\"ants and my ex's PP are the same size\">softcrybabyboy</a> \u00a0@<a href=\"https://jeonginorjeongjin.tumblr.com/\" title=\"I was a daydreamer, but now I'm just lost in you\">jeonginorjeongjin</a> @<a href=\"https://bees-are-so-great.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Bees\ud83d\udc1d\">bees-are-so-great</a>@<a href=\"https://holyhumorliteraturelight.tumblr.com/\" title=\"BUCKY IS NOT A VILLAIN\">holyhumorliteraturelight</a> @<a href=\"https://quirkyepicgamer.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Dumb\">quirkyepicgamer</a> @<a href=\"https://shortpeoplematter.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Shorty\">shortpeoplematter</a>@<a href=\"https://ipomea-alba-moonvine.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Untitled\">ipomea-alba-moonvine</a> @<a href=\"https://shirukitsune.tumblr.com/\">shirukitsune</a>@<a href=\"https://lilah427.tumblr.com/\">lilah427</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mALoOLhXNgg76c1FsCP6OLA\">@buckyandstevegayornay</a> @<a href=\"https://aprilcaver.tumblr.com/\" title=\"April Caver\">aprilcaver</a> @<a href=\"https://hvrcruxes.tumblr.com/\">hvrcruxes</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mm8WEb15B0gz3rHdI9nXcPQ\">@lieswithoutfairytales</a>\u00a0@infinitystones2018</i><i>\u00a0<a href=\"http://.tumblr.com\">@</a><a href=\"https://learning-howto-be-myselfx3.tumblr.com/\">\n\n</a><a href=\"https://learning-howto-be-myselfx3.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Who Am I?\">learning-howto-be-myselfx3</a>\u00a0@\n\n<a href=\"https://dreaalol.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Drea \ud83d\udc85\ud83c\udffc\">dreaalol</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM6-8eMWNYB_AjTB244O1hQ\">@lilspacefreckles</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://tentacleswooooot.tumblr.com/\" title=\"when I let people borrow my phone ;-;\">tentacleswooooot</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBryBBBhuE5_fwnXTM6gvZA\">@myshipsdontsail</a> @\n\n<a href=\"https://heatherjennings.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Heather Jennings\">heatherjennings</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYigQlrorjECkboWADtqEjw\">@taojiiih</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQ_m2ATX0JkzKRWEfubGiyA\">@moistpotatobear</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUAdFf1CiCUgrOFSOupFlaw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUAdFf1CiCUgrOFSOupFlaw\">@official-booty-toucher</a></i></p><p><i>Want to join the <a href=\"https://minkamousewritesfic.tumblr.com/post/184700973876/fan-fic-taglist\">taglist</a>?</i></p>",

God, did you know this.</p>\n<p>You were there, you were<i> in</i> Peter&rsquo;s head when it happened and yet some part of you still hoped that you were wrong, that the distance between Wakanda and whatever planet he was on was so great that although you were able to reach him, <i>finally</i> reach him, you had misunderstood what you had seen, what you had felt.</p>\n<p>Mr. Stark had miraculously returned to Earth two days ago and there was no news about Spider-Man being with him on the ship. No Peter Parker.</p>\n<p>The ugly vase Aunt May is so very fond of shatters and you come to your senses. Mr. Stark is in front of you, he probably should not be exerting the effort to get to your level, look you in the eye, but here he is, all skin and bones and haunted eyes. Aunt May has her hand over her chest, shocked by your powers destroying her vase, but she does not say anything.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Mr. Stark says, mouth slightly quirking upward out of habit.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;&hellip;hey,&rdquo; you say and although you really did not want to, you peaked into his mind.</p>\n<p>You never thought that you would witness someone having a moon thrown at them.</p>\n<p>Mr. Stark brings you out of his thoughts as quickly as you entered them.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Saw what you wanted?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You fought hard.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Not hard enough.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>You shake your head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your fault.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And you truly believe this. Although you really want to blame someone (and of course you can blame Thanos but he is not around to shout at) you cannot bring yourself to hate Mr. Stark.</p>\n<p>Mr. Stark nods his head and you do not need to read his mind to know that he carries Peter&rsquo;s death on his shoulders. You know that he wants you to blame him, probably why he let you in his head with no complaints.</p>\n<p>You place your hand on top of his and you push the thought of him being too skinny to the back of your mind.

God, did you know this.</p><p>You were there, you were<i> in</i> Peter\u2019s head when it happened and yet some part of you still hoped that you were wrong, that the distance between Wakanda and whatever planet he was on was so great that although you were able to reach him, <i>finally</i> reach him, you had misunderstood what you had seen, what you had felt.</p><p>Mr. Stark had miraculously returned to Earth two days ago and there was no news about Spider-Man being with him on the ship. No Peter Parker.</p><p>The ugly vase Aunt May is so very fond of shatters and you come to your senses. Mr. Stark is in front of you, he probably should not be exerting the effort to get to your level, look you in the eye, but here he is, all skin and bones and haunted eyes. Aunt May has her hand over her chest, shocked by your powers destroying her vase, but she does not say anything.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Mr. Stark says, mouth slightly quirking upward out of habit.</p><p>\u201c\u2026hey,\u201d you say and although you really did not want to, you peaked into his mind.</p><p>You never thought that you would witness someone having a moon thrown at them.</p><p>Mr. Stark brings you out of his thoughts as quickly as you entered them.</p><p>\u201cSaw what you wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fought hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot hard enough.\u201d</p><p>You shake your head. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p><p>And you truly believe this. Although you really want to blame someone (and of course you can blame Thanos but he is not around to shout at) you cannot bring yourself to hate Mr. Stark.</p><p>Mr. Stark nods his head and you do not need to read his mind to know that he carries Peter\u2019s death on his shoulders. You know that he wants you to blame him, probably why he let you in his head with no complaints.</p><p>You place your hand on top of his and you push the thought of him being too skinny to the back of your mind. You focus on making sure your smile reaches your eyes and you try to calm Mr. Stark\u2019s mind to the best of your abilities.</p><p>\u201cThanks for being there for him.\u201d</p><p>\u2026</p><p><i>1 Month After the Decimation</i></p><p>Aunt May never thought going to the grocery would be a surreal experience. She had gotten used to waiting in long lines and conversing with the cashiers at the checkout line but ever since\u2026well, that, life has been different. It was hard finding out her favorite cashier had disappeared along with many others but Aunt May managed. When half the population\u2014when your<i> family</i> disappears in the blink of an eye and you do not even have the chance to be with them when that happens, you do not have any choice but to manage</p><p>Aunt May barely manages to adjust the grocery bags in her arm to free up her hand when you slam the door open, staring up at her, breathing heavily as if you had just run a marathon. Aunt May looks down at you, surprised, and everything clicks in her mind and she figures out why tears are welling up in your eyes.</p><p>\u201cI just needed to get some ingredients,\u201d she tells you, using her free hand to smooth your hair. \u201cI left you a message.\u201d</p><p>You look down at your feet, digging your phone out of your back pocket. You press a button, but your screen does not light up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026forgot to charge my phone,\u201d you say, voice small. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, sweetie. I should have left a note somewhere, too. I\u2019ll be careful.\u201d</p><p>Aunt May gives you a smile that <i>does</i> reach her tired eyes and you feel guilt settle heavily in your stomach. You hate that you made Aunt May feel bad about leaving her own apartment but you could not help but panic when you woke up from your trance and could not find her anywhere.</p><p>It has been a weak since Tony Stark has come back down to Earth and ever since he has confirmed that Peter had indeed been a victim to Thano\u2019s snap, you could not help but go into some kind of shock. You tried to stay strong that day, tried not to breakdown in front of Mr. Stark, but once his too thin form walked out the door, you felt your world crumble.</p><p>Mr. Stark, an actual <i>hero</i>, lost.</p><p>You knew that happened. You were there with the rest of the Avengers when they lost, when<i> you</i> lost, but for some reason Mr. Stark\u2019s loss hit you harder. Took the wind out of your lungs and practically stopped your heart.</p><p>You have spent most of your days staring at the ceiling, sometimes just lying down on the sofa or floating in the middle of the living room, listening to the thoughts of everyone in your telepathic radius.</p><p>You have felt nothing but anger and anguish since the snap, your mind filled with the thoughts of everyone around you, mourning the loss of people you did not even know.</p><p>You wish that there was a way to turn off your thoughts, to find peace and quiet, but you are afraid of what is going to happen if you stop hearing everyone else.</p><p>You already know what it feels like to have your link with people severed, you do not think you can handle it happening again.</p><p>You do not want to be left alone again.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u2026</p><p><i>6 Months After the Decimation</i></p><p>It took you longer than you thought it would but you congratulate yourself for making it this far. The X-Mansion looks exactly the same way it did when you ran away that night and yet, at the same time, it looks entirely different. You try not to dwell on the fact that it probably is because a lot of the people you knew are no longer there. That Professor X is not there to welcome and reprimand you.</p><p>You do not bother to knock on the door. Instead, you unlock it with your powers and you step in as quietly as you can. You feel like an outsider, which is honestly a feat in the X-Mansion, and you wonder if you should just turn back and act like you were never there. You almost completely convince yourself to abandon ship when Megan steps into view, looking at you as if you were a ghost.</p><p>She probably thought you were. You regret not answering any of her messages.</p><p>Megan brings you into the tightest hug you have ever had, tighter than the one Aunt May gave you\u2014something you did not think was possible. She has tears in her eyes but you know that it would be a cold day in hell before she ever let them fall. Instead, she tilts her head back and tries to blink her tears back into their ducts. You are not quite sure how she manages to do that.</p><p>She holds onto your arm as if you need guidance, bringing around the X-Mansion. She does not tell you about who are still in the building but you figure it out yourself soon enough. It is not that hard, seeing as Megan has a mental list of who had mysteriously disappeared that day. You are glad that your good friends are still around but you feel your heart sink when you realize that, along with Professor X, majority of the professors did not make it.</p><p>Alumni had volunteered to watch over the students who did not or could not return to their homes.</p><p>Megan seems to have naturally taken the role as the mansion\u2019s older sister, making sure that everything and everyone is okay, even those who have left to be with their families.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t there,\u201d you tell Megan when you both settle in the kitchen, preparing lunch. \u201cIt must have been tough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to come back,\u201d Megan says with a shrug of her shoulder. She gives you a smile when she sees you make a conflicted face. \u201cI knew why you had to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just glad you\u2019re still here.\u201d</p><p>You watch as Megan brings out a stack of plates and you help her by floating the food out the door along with the utensils. You follow Megan\u2019s orders, placing the plates where they need to be and you watch as she calls for people to come to the table. You stand in the corner, watching your fellow mutants trickle in and you try not to linger in their heads for too long.</p><p>You find nothing new in their minds, they think the same things people back at Queens do, but you feel something different from them.</p><p>A different feeling of loss.</p><p>You smile at familiar and unfamiliar faces and you hope you look at least half as put together as Megan does.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>You should not have wandered off on your own but Megan had to discuss some things with the alumni and you could not bear to be alone in the living room with everyone else. You walked up to yours and Megan\u2019s room, you<i> hope</i> that it is still your room, and find that Megan has left all your things untouched.</p><p>You see a thick layer of dust on your desk and you cannot help but think that Megan left it alone out of spite because you ghosted her.</p><p>You cannot exactly blame her.</p><p>You walked towards the window, looking out of it to appreciate the view when the memory of Peter swinging to you in the dead of night just to check up on you hits you hard.</p><p>You nearly tear the curtains off the rod when you fall to the floor.</p><p>You see him in front of your for just a second, see him dressed in his Spider-Man costume, mask held tightly in his hand. He is smiling down at you, just like he did that night. Without thinking, you reach your hand out to him, just to touch him, and he disappears from your sight. Just like that. As fast as you can snap your fingers.</p><p>Megan comes into the room seconds after that and she runs to your side, asking you what happened. You look at her, your eyes wide and your mind fuzzy, and you realize that you had accidentally used your powers to flip your entire bed over and smash your desk against the wall.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026I saw\u2026,\u201d you begin, not sure if what you saw was really there despite all the things you know. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Meg. I\u2019ll\u2026I\u2019ll fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u2026</p><p><i>1 Year and a Half After the Decimation</i></p><p>You definitely owe Mr. Stark an explanation but he does not ask for one. Instead, he has you sit in his dining room while he brings out fresh orange juice from his refrigerator. One of Pepper\u2019s newest and most successful projects was her orange tree. She is also growing lemons and herbs. You think she\u2019ll try grapes next month.</p><p>Mr. Stark offers you a glass and you take it without comment. He has his own glass and he drinks it eagerly.</p><p>\u201cThat hits the spot,\u201d Mr. Stark says with a sigh, leaning back. He gestures for you to drink yours and you take slow sips, staring holes into his table.</p><p>You should have probably told someone about the dark thoughts. You know that you could have told literally anyone that all the negative thoughts you and other people were having were causing you to spiral, make your powers go off. Somedays, you had little to no control over them. You had destroyed things, hurt people.</p><p>You were\u2014<i>are</i> afraid.</p><p>But you do not know who to turn to.</p><p>Megan is busy handling things at the X-Mansion and you do not want to worry Aunt May. She worries about your almost catatonic episodes enough. You do not want her to think about your dwindling control over your powers. You cannot bother anymore. She is slowly getting better, learning to become happy again despite everything. You tell yourself you will not destroy her progress.</p><p>You do destroy about five fire hydrants, the fire escape and water tank of your building, the road heading towards the X-Mansion, and a jungle gym. You also end up controlling people, having walk into posts and, on one occasion, make some guy on the street believe that he is actually a dog.</p><p>It took a while to reverse the damage but you do in time for Mr. Stark to pick you and bring you to his new house by the lake.</p><p>\u201cY\u2019know what I really wish I could do right now?\u201d Mr. Stark starts, startling you out of your thoughts. You look up at him and see him pointing at you, eyes full of wonder and interest. You keep silent, hoping he would continue without you saying anything. He does. \u201cI wish I had your powers right now.\u201d</p><p>You feel your brows shoot up. After everything that has happened? He wants your powers?</p><p>\u201cY\u2019see, Morgan, sweetest baby angel in the world, does not let me sleep,\u201d Mr. Stark says, voice barely above a whisper. You look at him questioningly and before you can even ask why he is suddenly being so quiet; you hear a baby\u2019s wail from another room.</p><p>\u201cAll baby\u2019s cry, Mr. Stark,\u201d you tell him.</p><p>\u201cI know that. I just want to know what\u2019s making her cry,\u201d Mr. Stark runs a hand through his hair. \u201cI know if she\u2019s hungry or if she wants to sleep but what about the other times? What if there is actually something really bothering her? I want to be able to fix it.\u201d</p><p>You are not quite sure what to say. Unfortunately, you baby crying knowledge is close to zilch. Everything your saying is purely based on what you have seen in TV and in movies.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026don\u2019t they cry for no reason sometimes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s why I said your powers would really come in handy. I want to know if that\u2019s the reason, too,\u201d Mr. Stark shrugs. \u201cI bet that mind calming thing you do would really come in handy at night.\u201d</p><p>You feel your cheeks warm. \u201cYou noticed that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a lot gets past me, kid.\u201d Mr. Stark gets up from his seat and pats you on your shoulder. You are not sure why but somehow the heavy weight of his hand comforts you. \u201cI\u2019m going to head over to the Squirt\u2019s room to help out. Wanna meet her?\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p><a href=\"https://minkamousewritesfic.tumblr.com/post/185809736451/its-hard-when-youre-young-peter-parker-x-reader\">Part 24: Home</a></p><p><i>\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n<br></i></p><p><i>Taglist:</i></p><p><i><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIj52RC0XuSI6RcDC3_avug\">@xazu-ravenx</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8CmXuriy8t5caMStNuDaoQ\">@call-me-latte</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1P3msgsxO-Noc_jKlZKaPg\">@a-sunflower-sun</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbWnoS8kcQ-mmjGIamDWURg\">@duliz2014</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw4VjWrJEWr6WwBBMVBykcw\">@arisu003</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM6-8eMWNYB_AjTB244O1hQ\">@lilspacefreckles</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9jpsUIfZHmT4_9ISd-kVKQ\">@slideseok</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBTY7MShbhiNb3Hauh3PpZA\">@niiamh</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVRFoZYlCu8XDZ0nMvI8adw\">@intoomuchfandoms</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzisYX8eqaV2l0raAyirelA\">@naturallyspontaneous</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnEBBWEAS-ky9AAIvck1ezQ\">@jimenatateyama</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mo-MFXpt1YV2wmNXQw0C9gQ\">@le-yona</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnA0o4eAbx7J0wt3wIgliPQ\">@nicole-lynne</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGs7qK6Vo81-rq7k3q4tONA\">@clint-bartxn99</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1MfzScq_8L0AhximwRM8wg\">@kewl-r</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnoSxDk7r4DKrNxtGOj5jlw\">@autobotgirl15-blog</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8RopNrvvyXKaF265RSVNXw\">@peter-spider-parker-man</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfkPfAyQgusMXCuj6SCob5A\">@redgemsposts</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muvpc7UiYHeXGUf5LhZj3MA\">@shantayok</a> \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3fiyOXF_Q2PcFTV-Xi-2cg\">@throughlytired</a> \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNX5ZZN90g-LRU5oJlZg6AQ\">@sk-o-mp</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCSNlsBXojzIby9-m21lQTw\">@amb-q</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnJc3qUZdf4ThjsWqbDC1MQ\">@justfuxxingkillmealready</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjGA2SF0yjFFzEHVftwHPjg\">@spidey-quackson</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwBCr_bgyyEWgP4rzIVbOkQ\">@sketchcole</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJSpsgywe-IH9XI2oxhBqsQ\">@patat-boi</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWe-Gim3fCT58hc3c2V62yA\">@waywaya</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV155O6iryeIB1bzRvtXHXw\">@akira-0229</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFeag8NmH4_6GfQ2hXDmArg\">@yunggenoalpha</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mL5ioo93YPr5IXYLdpa_N9w\">@alina-margaret</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnGf32jLkXSykoj5olbM7hg\">@astromilku</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnqojvhOI5PW669I4MMuSKA\">@thewaywarddaughter1967</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msGaFxudFWLw_ENpXzP1AJQ\">@minetticatinwonderland</a> @<a href=\"https://softcrybabyboy.tumblr.com/\" title=\"ants and my ex's PP are the same size\">softcrybabyboy</a> \u00a0@<a href=\"https://jeonginorjeongjin.tumblr.com/\" title=\"I was a daydreamer, but now I'm just lost in you\">jeonginorjeongjin</a> @<a href=\"https://bees-are-so-great.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Bees\ud83d\udc1d\">bees-are-so-great</a>@<a href=\"https://holyhumorliteraturelight.tumblr.com/\" title=\"BUCKY IS NOT A VILLAIN\">holyhumorliteraturelight</a> @<a href=\"https://quirkyepicgamer.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Dumb\">quirkyepicgamer</a> @<a href=\"https://shortpeoplematter.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Shorty\">shortpeoplematter</a>@<a href=\"https://ipomea-alba-moonvine.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Untitled\">ipomea-alba-moonvine</a> @<a href=\"https://shirukitsune.tumblr.com/\">shirukitsune</a>@<a href=\"https://lilah427.tumblr.com/\">lilah427</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mALoOLhXNgg76c1FsCP6OLA\">@buckyandstevegayornay</a> @<a href=\"https://aprilcaver.tumblr.com/\" title=\"April Caver\">aprilcaver</a> @<a href=\"https://hvrcruxes.tumblr.com/\">hvrcruxes</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mm8WEb15B0gz3rHdI9nXcPQ\">@lieswithoutfairytales</a>\u00a0@infinitystones2018</i><i>\u00a0<a href=\"http://.tumblr.com\">@</a><a href=\"https://learning-howto-be-myselfx3.tumblr.com/\">\n\n</a><a href=\"https://learning-howto-be-myselfx3.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Who Am I?\">learning-howto-be-myselfx3</a>\u00a0@\n\n<a href=\"https://dreaalol.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Drea \ud83d\udc85\ud83c\udffc\">dreaalol</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM6-8eMWNYB_AjTB244O1hQ\">@lilspacefreckles</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://tentacleswooooot.tumblr.com/\" title=\"when I let people borrow my phone ;-;\">tentacleswooooot</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBryBBBhuE5_fwnXTM6gvZA\">@myshipsdontsail</a> @\n\n<a href=\"https://heatherjennings.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Heather Jennings\">heatherjennings</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYigQlrorjECkboWADtqEjw\">@taojiiih</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQ_m2ATX0JkzKRWEfubGiyA\">@moistpotatobear</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUAdFf1CiCUgrOFSOupFlaw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUAdFf1CiCUgrOFSOupFlaw\">@official-booty-toucher</a></i></p><p><i>Want to join the <a href=\"https://minkamousewritesfic.tumblr.com/post/184700973876/fan-fic-taglist\">taglist</a>?</i></p>",

You do not hear Aunt May\u2019s sobs nor Mr. Stark\u2019s apologies. You do not hear the thoughts of your neighbors, how they had lost their daughter to the snap, or the thoughts of those living in the building beside yours, or the one beside that, or the thoughts of those in the next city.</p><p>In this agonizingly short moment, all you can hear is Mr. Stark\u2019s voice ringing in your head.</p><p><i>\u201cI\u2026the kid\u2026Peter\u2026I couldn\u2019t save Peter. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</i></p><p>You knew this. God, did you know this.</p><p>You were there, you were<i> in</i> Peter\u2019s head when it happened and yet some part of you still hoped that you were wrong, that the distance between Wakanda and whatever planet he was on was so great that although you were able to reach him, <i>finally</i> reach him, you had misunderstood what you had seen, what you had felt.</p><p>Mr. Stark had miraculously returned to Earth two days ago and there was no news about Spider-Man being with him on the ship. No Peter Parker.</p><p>The ugly vase Aunt May is so very fond of shatters and you come to your senses. Mr. Stark is in front of you, he probably should not be exerting the effort to get to your level, look you in the eye, but here he is, all skin and bones and haunted eyes. Aunt May has her hand over her chest, shocked by your powers destroying her vase, but she does not say anything.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Mr. Stark says, mouth slightly quirking upward out of habit.</p><p>\u201c\u2026hey,\u201d you say and although you really did not want to, you peaked into his mind.</p><p>You never thought that you would witness someone having a moon thrown at them.</p><p>Mr. Stark brings you out of his thoughts as quickly as you entered them.</p><p>\u201cSaw what you wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fought hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot hard enough.\u201d</p><p>You shake your head. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p><p>And you truly believe this. Although you really want to blame someone (and of course you can blame Thanos but he is not around to shout at) you cannot bring yourself to hate Mr. Stark.</p><p>Mr. Stark nods his head and you do not need to read his mind to know that he carries Peter\u2019s death on his shoulders. You know that he wants you to blame him, probably why he let you in his head with no complaints.</p><p>You place your hand on top of his and you push the thought of him being too skinny to the back of your mind. You focus on making sure your smile reaches your eyes and you try to calm Mr. Stark\u2019s mind to the best of your abilities.</p><p>\u201cThanks for being there for him.\u201d</p><p>\u2026</p><p><i>1 Month After the Decimation</i></p><p>Aunt May never thought going to the grocery would be a surreal experience. She had gotten used to waiting in long lines and conversing with the cashiers at the checkout line but ever since\u2026well, that, life has been different. It was hard finding out her favorite cashier had disappeared along with many others but Aunt May managed. When half the population\u2014when your<i> family</i> disappears in the blink of an eye and you do not even have the chance to be with them when that happens, you do not have any choice but to manage</p><p>Aunt May barely manages to adjust the grocery bags in her arm to free up her hand when you slam the door open, staring up at her, breathing heavily as if you had just run a marathon. Aunt May looks down at you, surprised, and everything clicks in her mind and she figures out why tears are welling up in your eyes.</p><p>\u201cI just needed to get some ingredients,\u201d she tells you, using her free hand to smooth your hair. \u201cI left you a message.\u201d</p><p>You look down at your feet, digging your phone out of your back pocket. You press a button, but your screen does not light up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026forgot to charge my phone,\u201d you say, voice small. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, sweetie. I should have left a note somewhere, too. I\u2019ll be careful.\u201d</p><p>Aunt May gives you a smile that <i>does</i> reach her tired eyes and you feel guilt settle heavily in your stomach. You hate that you made Aunt May feel bad about leaving her own apartment but you could not help but panic when you woke up from your trance and could not find her anywhere.</p><p>It has been a weak since Tony Stark has come back down to Earth and ever since he has confirmed that Peter had indeed been a victim to Thano\u2019s snap, you could not help but go into some kind of shock. You tried to stay strong that day, tried not to breakdown in front of Mr. Stark, but once his too thin form walked out the door, you felt your world crumble.</p><p>Mr. Stark, an actual <i>hero</i>, lost.</p><p>You knew that happened. You were there with the rest of the Avengers when they lost, when<i> you</i> lost, but for some reason Mr. Stark\u2019s loss hit you harder. Took the wind out of your lungs and practically stopped your heart.</p><p>You have spent most of your days staring at the ceiling, sometimes just lying down on the sofa or floating in the middle of the living room, listening to the thoughts of everyone in your telepathic radius.</p><p>You have felt nothing but anger and anguish since the snap, your mind filled with the thoughts of everyone around you, mourning the loss of people you did not even know.</p><p>You wish that there was a way to turn off your thoughts, to find peace and quiet, but you are afraid of what is going to happen if you stop hearing everyone else.</p><p>You already know what it feels like to have your link with people severed, you do not think you can handle it happening again.</p><p>You do not want to be left alone again.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u2026</p><p><i>6 Months After the Decimation</i></p><p>It took you longer than you thought it would but you congratulate yourself for making it this far. The X-Mansion looks exactly the same way it did when you ran away that night and yet, at the same time, it looks entirely different. You try not to dwell on the fact that it probably is because a lot of the people you knew are no longer there. That Professor X is not there to welcome and reprimand you.</p><p>You do not bother to knock on the door. Instead, you unlock it with your powers and you step in as quietly as you can. You feel like an outsider, which is honestly a feat in the X-Mansion, and you wonder if you should just turn back and act like you were never there. You almost completely convince yourself to abandon ship when Megan steps into view, looking at you as if you were a ghost.</p><p>She probably thought you were. You regret not answering any of her messages.</p><p>Megan brings you into the tightest hug you have ever had, tighter than the one Aunt May gave you\u2014something you did not think was possible. She has tears in her eyes but you know that it would be a cold day in hell before she ever let them fall. Instead, she tilts her head back and tries to blink her tears back into their ducts. You are not quite sure how she manages to do that.</p><p>She holds onto your arm as if you need guidance, bringing around the X-Mansion. She does not tell you about who are still in the building but you figure it out yourself soon enough. It is not that hard, seeing as Megan has a mental list of who had mysteriously disappeared that day. You are glad that your good friends are still around but you feel your heart sink when you realize that, along with Professor X, majority of the professors did not make it.</p><p>Alumni had volunteered to watch over the students who did not or could not return to their homes.</p><p>Megan seems to have naturally taken the role as the mansion\u2019s older sister, making sure that everything and everyone is okay, even those who have left to be with their families.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t there,\u201d you tell Megan when you both settle in the kitchen, preparing lunch. \u201cIt must have been tough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to come back,\u201d Megan says with a shrug of her shoulder. She gives you a smile when she sees you make a conflicted face. \u201cI knew why you had to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just glad you\u2019re still here.\u201d</p><p>You watch as Megan brings out a stack of plates and you help her by floating the food out the door along with the utensils. You follow Megan\u2019s orders, placing the plates where they need to be and you watch as she calls for people to come to the table. You stand in the corner, watching your fellow mutants trickle in and you try not to linger in their heads for too long.</p><p>You find nothing new in their minds, they think the same things people back at Queens do, but you feel something different from them.</p><p>A different feeling of loss.</p><p>You smile at familiar and unfamiliar faces and you hope you look at least half as put together as Megan does.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>You should not have wandered off on your own but Megan had to discuss some things with the alumni and you could not bear to be alone in the living room with everyone else. You walked up to yours and Megan\u2019s room, you<i> hope</i> that it is still your room, and find that Megan has left all your things untouched.</p><p>You see a thick layer of dust on your desk and you cannot help but think that Megan left it alone out of spite because you ghosted her.</p><p>You cannot exactly blame her.</p><p>You walked towards the window, looking out of it to appreciate the view when the memory of Peter swinging to you in the dead of night just to check up on you hits you hard.</p><p>You nearly tear the curtains off the rod when you fall to the floor.</p><p>You see him in front of your for just a second, see him dressed in his Spider-Man costume, mask held tightly in his hand. He is smiling down at you, just like he did that night. Without thinking, you reach your hand out to him, just to touch him, and he disappears from your sight. Just like that. As fast as you can snap your fingers.</p><p>Megan comes into the room seconds after that and she runs to your side, asking you what happened. You look at her, your eyes wide and your mind fuzzy, and you realize that you had accidentally used your powers to flip your entire bed over and smash your desk against the wall.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026I saw\u2026,\u201d you begin, not sure if what you saw was really there despite all the things you know. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Meg. I\u2019ll\u2026I\u2019ll fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u2026</p><p><i>1 Year and a Half After the Decimation</i></p><p>You definitely owe Mr. Stark an explanation but he does not ask for one. Instead, he has you sit in his dining room while he brings out fresh orange juice from his refrigerator. One of Pepper\u2019s newest and most successful projects was her orange tree. She is also growing lemons and herbs. You think she\u2019ll try grapes next month.</p><p>Mr. Stark offers you a glass and you take it without comment. He has his own glass and he drinks it eagerly.</p><p>\u201cThat hits the spot,\u201d Mr. Stark says with a sigh, leaning back. He gestures for you to drink yours and you take slow sips, staring holes into his table.</p><p>You should have probably told someone about the dark thoughts. You know that you could have told literally anyone that all the negative thoughts you and other people were having were causing you to spiral, make your powers go off. Somedays, you had little to no control over them. You had destroyed things, hurt people.</p><p>You were\u2014<i>are</i> afraid.</p><p>But you do not know who to turn to.</p><p>Megan is busy handling things at the X-Mansion and you do not want to worry Aunt May. She worries about your almost catatonic episodes enough. You do not want her to think about your dwindling control over your powers. You cannot bother anymore. She is slowly getting better, learning to become happy again despite everything. You tell yourself you will not destroy her progress.</p><p>You do destroy about five fire hydrants, the fire escape and water tank of your building, the road heading towards the X-Mansion, and a jungle gym. You also end up controlling people, having walk into posts and, on one occasion, make some guy on the street believe that he is actually a dog.</p><p>It took a while to reverse the damage but you do in time for Mr. Stark to pick you and bring you to his new house by the lake.</p><p>\u201cY\u2019know what I really wish I could do right now?\u201d Mr. Stark starts, startling you out of your thoughts. You look up at him and see him pointing at you, eyes full of wonder and interest. You keep silent, hoping he would continue without you saying anything. He does. \u201cI wish I had your powers right now.\u201d</p><p>You feel your brows shoot up. After everything that has happened? He wants your powers?</p><p>\u201cY\u2019see, Morgan, sweetest baby angel in the world, does not let me sleep,\u201d Mr. Stark says, voice barely above a whisper. You look at him questioningly and before you can even ask why he is suddenly being so quiet; you hear a baby\u2019s wail from another room.</p><p>\u201cAll baby\u2019s cry, Mr. Stark,\u201d you tell him.</p><p>\u201cI know that. I just want to know what\u2019s making her cry,\u201d Mr. Stark runs a hand through his hair. \u201cI know if she\u2019s hungry or if she wants to sleep but what about the other times? What if there is actually something really bothering her? I want to be able to fix it.\u201d</p><p>You are not quite sure what to say. Unfortunately, you baby crying knowledge is close to zilch. Everything your saying is purely based on what you have seen in TV and in movies.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026don\u2019t they cry for no reason sometimes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s why I said your powers would really come in handy. I want to know if that\u2019s the reason, too,\u201d Mr. Stark shrugs. \u201cI bet that mind calming thing you do would really come in handy at night.\u201d</p><p>You feel your cheeks warm. \u201cYou noticed that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a lot gets past me, kid.\u201d Mr. Stark gets up from his seat and pats you on your shoulder. You are not sure why but somehow the heavy weight of his hand comforts you. \u201cI\u2019m going to head over to the Squirt\u2019s room to help out. Wanna meet her?\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p><a href=\"https://minkamousewritesfic.tumblr.com/post/185809736451/its-hard-when-youre-young-peter-parker-x-reader\">Part 24: Home</a></p><p><i>\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n<br></i></p><p><i>Taglist:</i></p><p><i><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIj52RC0XuSI6RcDC3_avug\">@xazu-ravenx</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8CmXuriy8t5caMStNuDaoQ\">@call-me-latte</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1P3msgsxO-Noc_jKlZKaPg\">@a-sunflower-sun</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbWnoS8kcQ-mmjGIamDWURg\">@duliz2014</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw4VjWrJEWr6WwBBMVBykcw\">@arisu003</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM6-8eMWNYB_AjTB244O1hQ\">@lilspacefreckles</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9jpsUIfZHmT4_9ISd-kVKQ\">@slideseok</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBTY7MShbhiNb3Hauh3PpZA\">@niiamh</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVRFoZYlCu8XDZ0nMvI8adw\">@intoomuchfandoms</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzisYX8eqaV2l0raAyirelA\">@naturallyspontaneous</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnEBBWEAS-ky9AAIvck1ezQ\">@jimenatateyama</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mo-MFXpt1YV2wmNXQw0C9gQ\">@le-yona</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnA0o4eAbx7J0wt3wIgliPQ\">@nicole-lynne</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGs7qK6Vo81-rq7k3q4tONA\">@clint-bartxn99</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1MfzScq_8L0AhximwRM8wg\">@kewl-r</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnoSxDk7r4DKrNxtGOj5jlw\">@autobotgirl15-blog</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8RopNrvvyXKaF265RSVNXw\">@peter-spider-parker-man</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfkPfAyQgusMXCuj6SCob5A\">@redgemsposts</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muvpc7UiYHeXGUf5LhZj3MA\">@shantayok</a> \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3fiyOXF_Q2PcFTV-Xi-2cg\">@throughlytired</a> \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNX5ZZN90g-LRU5oJlZg6AQ\">@sk-o-mp</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCSNlsBXojzIby9-m21lQTw\">@amb-q</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnJc3qUZdf4ThjsWqbDC1MQ\">@justfuxxingkillmealready</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjGA2SF0yjFFzEHVftwHPjg\">@spidey-quackson</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwBCr_bgyyEWgP4rzIVbOkQ\">@sketchcole</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJSpsgywe-IH9XI2oxhBqsQ\">@patat-boi</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWe-Gim3fCT58hc3c2V62yA\">@waywaya</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV155O6iryeIB1bzRvtXHXw\">@akira-0229</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFeag8NmH4_6GfQ2hXDmArg\">@yunggenoalpha</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mL5ioo93YPr5IXYLdpa_N9w\">@alina-margaret</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnGf32jLkXSykoj5olbM7hg\">@astromilku</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnqojvhOI5PW669I4MMuSKA\">@thewaywarddaughter1967</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msGaFxudFWLw_ENpXzP1AJQ\">@minetticatinwonderland</a> @<a href=\"https://softcrybabyboy.tumblr.com/\" title=\"ants and my ex's PP are the same size\">softcrybabyboy</a> \u00a0@<a href=\"https://jeonginorjeongjin.tumblr.com/\" title=\"I was a daydreamer, but now I'm just lost in you\">jeonginorjeongjin</a> @<a href=\"https://bees-are-so-great.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Bees\ud83d\udc1d\">bees-are-so-great</a>@<a href=\"https://holyhumorliteraturelight.tumblr.com/\" title=\"BUCKY IS NOT A VILLAIN\">holyhumorliteraturelight</a> @<a href=\"https://quirkyepicgamer.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Dumb\">quirkyepicgamer</a> @<a href=\"https://shortpeoplematter.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Shorty\">shortpeoplematter</a>@<a href=\"https://ipomea-alba-moonvine.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Untitled\">ipomea-alba-moonvine</a> @<a href=\"https://shirukitsune.tumblr.com/\">shirukitsune</a>@<a href=\"https://lilah427.tumblr.com/\">lilah427</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mALoOLhXNgg76c1FsCP6OLA\">@buckyandstevegayornay</a> @<a href=\"https://aprilcaver.tumblr.com/\" title=\"April Caver\">aprilcaver</a> @<a href=\"https://hvrcruxes.tumblr.com/\">hvrcruxes</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mm8WEb15B0gz3rHdI9nXcPQ\">@lieswithoutfairytales</a>\u00a0@infinitystones2018</i><i>\u00a0<a href=\"http://.tumblr.com\">@</a><a href=\"https://learning-howto-be-myselfx3.tumblr.com/\">\n\n</a><a href=\"https://learning-howto-be-myselfx3.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Who Am I?\">learning-howto-be-myselfx3</a>\u00a0@\n\n<a href=\"https://dreaalol.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Drea \ud83d\udc85\ud83c\udffc\">dreaalol</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM6-8eMWNYB_AjTB244O1hQ\">@lilspacefreckles</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://tentacleswooooot.tumblr.com/\" title=\"when I let people borrow my phone ;-;\">tentacleswooooot</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBryBBBhuE5_fwnXTM6gvZA\">@myshipsdontsail</a> @\n\n<a href=\"https://heatherjennings.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Heather Jennings\">heatherjennings</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYigQlrorjECkboWADtqEjw\">@taojiiih</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQ_m2ATX0JkzKRWEfubGiyA\">@moistpotatobear</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUAdFf1CiCUgrOFSOupFlaw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUAdFf1CiCUgrOFSOupFlaw\">@official-booty-toucher</a></i></p><p><i>Want to join the <a href=\"https://minkamousewritesfic.tumblr.com/post/184700973876/fan-fic-taglist\">taglist</a>?</i></p>",

You press a button, but your screen does not light up.</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;forgot to charge my phone,&rdquo; you say, voice small. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, sweetie. I should have left a note somewhere, too. I&rsquo;ll be careful.&rdquo;</p><p>Aunt May gives you a smile that <i>does</i> reach her tired eyes and you feel guilt settle heavily in your stomach. You hate that you made Aunt May feel bad about leaving her own apartment but you could not help but panic when you woke up from your trance and could not find her anywhere.</p><p>It has been a weak since Tony Stark has come back down to Earth and ever since he has confirmed that Peter had indeed been a victim to Thano&rsquo;s snap, you could not help but go into some kind of shock. You tried to stay strong that day, tried not to breakdown in front of Mr. Stark, but once his too thin form walked out the door, you felt your world crumble.</p><p>Mr. Stark, an actual <i>hero</i>, lost.</p><p>You knew that happened. You were there with the rest of the Avengers when they lost, when<i> you</i> lost, but for some reason Mr. Stark&rsquo;s loss hit you harder. Took the wind out of your lungs and practically stopped your heart.</p><p>You have spent most of your days staring at the ceiling, sometimes just lying down on the sofa or floating in the middle of the living room, listening to the thoughts of everyone in your telepathic radius.</p><p>You have felt nothing but anger and anguish since the snap, your mind filled with the thoughts of everyone around you, mourning the loss of people you did not even know.</p><p>You wish that there was a way to turn off your thoughts, to find peace and quiet, but you are afraid of what is going to happen if you stop hearing everyone else.</p><p>You already know what it feels like to have your link with people severed, you do not think you can handle it happening again.</p><p>You do not want to be left alone again.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p><i>6 Months After the Decimation</i></p><p>It took you longer than you thought it would but you congratulate yourself for making it this far. The X-Mansion looks exactly the same way it did when you ran away that night and yet, at the same time, it looks entirely different. You try not to dwell on the fact that it probably is because a lot of the people you knew are no longer there. That Professor X is not there to welcome and reprimand you.</p><p>You do not bother to knock on the door. Instead, you unlock it with your powers and you step in as quietly as you can. You feel like an outsider, which is honestly a feat in the X-Mansion, and you wonder if you should just turn back and act like you were never there. You almost completely convince yourself to abandon ship when Megan steps into view, looking at you as if you were a ghost.</p><p>She probably thought you were. You regret not answering any of her messages.</p><p>Megan brings you into the tightest hug you have ever had, tighter than the one Aunt May gave you&mdash;something you did not think was possible. She has tears in her eyes but you know that it would be a cold day in hell before she ever let them fall. Instead, she tilts her head back and tries to blink her tears back into their ducts. You are not quite sure how she manages to do that.</p><p>She holds onto your arm as if you need guidance, bringing around the X-Mansion. She does not tell you about who are still in the building but you figure it out yourself soon enough. It is not that hard, seeing as Megan has a mental list of who had mysteriously disappeared that day. You are glad that your good friends are still around but you feel your heart sink when you realize that, along with Professor X, majority of the professors did not make it.</p><p>Alumni had volunteered to watch over the students who did not or could not return to their homes.</p><p>Megan seems to have naturally taken the role as the mansion&rsquo;s older sister, making sure that everything and everyone is okay, even those who have left to be with their families.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I wasn&rsquo;t there,&rdquo; you tell Megan when you both settle in the kitchen, preparing lunch. &ldquo;It must have been tough.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect you to come back,&rdquo; Megan says with a shrug of her shoulder. She gives you a smile when she sees you make a conflicted face. &ldquo;I knew why you had to leave.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Still.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just glad you&rsquo;re still here.&rdquo;</p><p>You watch as Megan brings out a stack of plates and you help her by floating the food out the door along with the utensils. You follow Megan&rsquo;s orders, placing the plates where they need to be and you watch as she calls for people to come to the table. You stand in the corner, watching your fellow mutants trickle in and you try not to linger in their heads for too long.</p><p>You find nothing new in their minds, they think the same things people back at Queens do, but you feel something different from them.</p><p>A different feeling of loss.</p><p>You smile at familiar and unfamiliar faces and you hope you look at least half as put together as Megan does.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>You should not have wandered off on your own but Megan had to discuss some things with the alumni and you could not bear to be alone in the living room with everyone else. You walked up to yours and Megan&rsquo;s room, you<i> hope</i> that it is still your room, and find that Megan has left all your things untouched.</p><p>You see a thick layer of dust on your desk and you cannot help but think that Megan left it alone out of spite because you ghosted her.</p><p>You cannot exactly blame her.</p><p>You walked towards the window, looking out of it to appreciate the view when the memory of Peter swinging to you in the dead of night just to check up on you hits you hard.</p><p>You nearly tear the curtains off the rod when you fall to the floor.</p><p>You see him in front of your for just a second, see him dressed in his Spider-Man costume, mask held tightly in his hand. He is smiling down at you, just like he did that night. Without thinking, you reach your hand out to him, just to touch him, and he disappears from your sight. Just like that. As fast as you can snap your fingers.</p><p>Megan comes into the room seconds after that and she runs to your side, asking you what happened. You look at her, your eyes wide and your mind fuzzy, and you realize that you had accidentally used your powers to flip your entire bed over and smash your desk against the wall.</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;I saw&hellip;,&rdquo; you begin, not sure if what you saw was really there despite all the things you know. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Meg. I&rsquo;ll&hellip;I&rsquo;ll fix it.&rdquo;</p><p>&hellip;</p><p><i>1 Year and a Half After the Decimation</i></p><p>You definitely owe Mr. Stark an explanation but he does not ask for one. Instead, he has you sit in his dining room while he brings out fresh orange juice from his refrigerator. One of Pepper&rsquo;s newest and most successful projects was her orange tree. She is also growing lemons and herbs. You think she&rsquo;ll try grapes next month.</p><p>Mr. Stark offers you a glass and you take it without comment. He has his own glass and he drinks it eagerly.</p><p>&ldquo;That hits the spot,&rdquo; Mr. Stark says with a sigh, leaning back. He gestures for you to drink yours and you take slow sips, staring holes into his table.</p><p>You should have probably told someone about the dark thoughts. You know that you could have told literally anyone that all the negative thoughts you and other people were having were causing you to spiral, make your powers go off. Somedays, you had little to no control over them. You had destroyed things, hurt people.</p><p>You were&mdash;<i>are</i> afraid.</p><p>But you do not know who to turn to.</p><p>Megan is busy handling things at the X-Mansion and you do not want to worry Aunt May. She worries about your almost catatonic episodes enough. You do not want her to think about your dwindling control over your powers. You cannot bother anymore. She is slowly getting better, learning to become happy again despite everything. You tell yourself you will not destroy her progress.</p><p>You do destroy about five fire hydrants, the fire escape and water tank of your building, the road heading towards the X-Mansion, and a jungle gym. You also end up controlling people, having walk into posts and, on one occasion, make some guy on the street believe that he is actually a dog.</p><p>It took a while to reverse the damage but you do in time for Mr. Stark to pick you and bring you to his new house by the lake.</p><p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;know what I really wish I could do right now?&rdquo; Mr. Stark starts, startling you out of your thoughts. You look up at him and see him pointing at you, eyes full of wonder and interest. You keep silent, hoping he would continue without you saying anything. He does. &ldquo;I wish I had your powers right now.&rdquo;</p><p>You feel your brows shoot up. After everything that has happened? He wants your powers?</p><p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;see, Morgan, sweetest baby angel in the world, does not let me sleep,&rdquo; Mr. Stark says, voice barely above a whisper. You look at him questioningly and before you can even ask why he is suddenly being so quiet; you hear a baby&rsquo;s wail from another room.</p><p>&ldquo;All baby&rsquo;s cry, Mr. Stark,&rdquo; you tell him.</p><p>&ldquo;I know that. I just want to know what&rsquo;s making her cry,&rdquo; Mr. Stark runs a hand through his hair. &ldquo;I know if she&rsquo;s hungry or if she wants to sleep but what about the other times? What if there is actually something really bothering her? I want to be able to fix it.&rdquo;</p><p>You are not quite sure what to say. Unfortunately, you baby crying knowledge is close to zilch. Everything your saying is purely based on what you have seen in TV and in movies.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&hellip;don&rsquo;t they cry for no reason sometimes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s why I said your powers would really come in handy. I want to know if that&rsquo;s the reason, too,&rdquo; Mr. Stark shrugs. &ldquo;I bet that mind calming thing you do would really come in handy at night.&rdquo;</p><p>You feel your cheeks warm. &ldquo;You noticed that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not a lot gets past me, kid.&rdquo; Mr. Stark gets up from his seat and pats you on your shoulder. You are not sure why but somehow the heavy weight of his hand comforts you. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to head over to the Squirt&rsquo;s room to help out. Wanna meet her?&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p><a href=\"https://minkamousewritesfic.tumblr.com/post/185809736451/its-hard-when-youre-young-peter-parker-x-reader\">Part 24: Home</a></p><p><i>\n\n&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-\n\n<br /></i></p><p><i>Taglist:</i></p><p><i><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIj52RC0XuSI6RcDC3_avug\">@xazu-ravenx</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8CmXuriy8t5caMStNuDaoQ\">@call-me-latte</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1P3msgsxO-Noc_jKlZKaPg\">@a-sunflower-sun</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbWnoS8kcQ-mmjGIamDWURg\">@duliz2014</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw4VjWrJEWr6WwBBMVBykcw\">@arisu003</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM6-8eMWNYB_AjTB244O1hQ\">@lilspacefreckles</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9jpsUIfZHmT4_9ISd-kVKQ\">@slideseok</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBTY7MShbhiNb3Hauh3PpZA\">@niiamh</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVRFoZYlCu8XDZ0nMvI8adw\">@intoomuchfandoms</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzisYX8eqaV2l0raAyirelA\">@naturallyspontaneous</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnEBBWEAS-ky9AAIvck1ezQ\">@jimenatateyama</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mo-MFXpt1YV2wmNXQw0C9gQ\">@le-yona</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnA0o4eAbx7J0wt3wIgliPQ\">@nicole-lynne</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGs7qK6Vo81-rq7k3q4tONA\">@clint-bartxn99</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1MfzScq_8L0AhximwRM8wg\">@kewl-r</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnoSxDk7r4DKrNxtGOj5jlw\">@autobotgirl15-blog</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8RopNrvvyXKaF265RSVNXw\">@peter-spider-parker-man</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfkPfAyQgusMXCuj6SCob5A\">@redgemsposts</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muvpc7UiYHeXGUf5LhZj3MA\">@shantayok</a> &nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3fiyOXF_Q2PcFTV-Xi-2cg\">@throughlytired</a> &nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNX5ZZN90g-LRU5oJlZg6AQ\">@sk-o-mp</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCSNlsBXojzIby9-m21lQTw\">@amb-q</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnJc3qUZdf4ThjsWqbDC1MQ\">@justfuxxingkillmealready</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjGA2SF0yjFFzEHVftwHPjg\">@spidey-quackson</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwBCr_bgyyEWgP4rzIVbOkQ\">@sketchcole</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJSpsgywe-IH9XI2oxhBqsQ\">@patat-boi</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWe-Gim3fCT58hc3c2V62yA\">@waywaya</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV155O6iryeIB1bzRvtXHXw\">@akira-0229</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFeag8NmH4_6GfQ2hXDmArg\">@yunggenoalpha</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mL5ioo93YPr5IXYLdpa_N9w\">@alina-margaret</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnGf32jLkXSykoj5olbM7hg\">@astromilku</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnqojvhOI5PW669I4MMuSKA\">@thewaywarddaughter1967</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msGaFxudFWLw_ENpXzP1AJQ\">@minetticatinwonderland</a> @<a href=\"https://softcrybabyboy.tumblr.com/\" title=\"ants and my ex's PP are the same size\">softcrybabyboy</a> &nbsp;@<a href=\"https://jeonginorjeongjin.tumblr.com/\" title=\"I was a daydreamer, but now I'm just lost in you\">jeonginorjeongjin</a> @<a href=\"https://bees-are-so-great.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Bees&#128029;\">bees-are-so-great</a>@<a href=\"https://holyhumorliteraturelight.tumblr.com/\" title=\"BUCKY IS NOT A VILLAIN\">holyhumorliteraturelight</a> @<a href=\"https://quirkyepicgamer.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Dumb\">quirkyepicgamer</a> @<a href=\"https://shortpeoplematter.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Shorty\">shortpeoplematter</a>@<a href=\"https://ipomea-alba-moonvine.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Untitled\">ipomea-alba-moonvine</a> @<a href=\"https://shirukitsune.tumblr.com/\">shirukitsune</a>@<a href=\"https://lilah427.tumblr.com/\">lilah427</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mALoOLhXNgg76c1FsCP6OLA\">@buckyandstevegayornay</a> @<a href=\"https://aprilcaver.tumblr.com/\" title=\"April Caver\">aprilcaver</a> @<a href=\"https://hvrcruxes.tumblr.com/\">hvrcruxes</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mm8WEb15B0gz3rHdI9nXcPQ\">@lieswithoutfairytales</a>&nbsp;@infinitystones2018</i><i>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://.tumblr.com\">@</a><a href=\"https://learning-howto-be-myselfx3.tumblr.com/\">\n\n</a><a href=\"https://learning-howto-be-myselfx3.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Who Am I?\">learning-howto-be-myselfx3</a>&nbsp;@\n\n<a href=\"https://dreaalol.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Drea &#128133;&#127996;\">dreaalol</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM6-8eMWNYB_AjTB244O1hQ\">@lilspacefreckles</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://tentacleswooooot.tumblr.com/\" title=\"when I let people borrow my phone ;-;\">tentacleswooooot</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBryBBBhuE5_fwnXTM6gvZA\">@myshipsdontsail</a> @\n\n<a href=\"https://heatherjennings.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Heather Jennings\">heatherjennings</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYigQlrorjECkboWADtqEjw\">@taojiiih</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQ_m2ATX0JkzKRWEfubGiyA\">@moistpotatobear</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUAdFf1CiCUgrOFSOupFlaw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUAdFf1CiCUgrOFSOupFlaw\">@official-booty-toucher</a></i></p><p><i>Want to join the <a href=\"https://minkamousewritesfic.tumblr.com/post/184700973876/fan-fic-taglist\">taglist</a>?</i></p>",

You do not hear Aunt May&rsquo;s sobs nor Mr. Stark&rsquo;s apologies. You do not hear the thoughts of your neighbors, how they had lost their daughter to the snap, or the thoughts of those living in the building beside yours, or the one beside that, or the thoughts of those in the next city.</p>\n<p>In this agonizingly short moment, all you can hear is Mr. Stark&rsquo;s voice ringing in your head.</p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;I&hellip;the kid&hellip;Peter&hellip;I couldn&rsquo;t save Peter. I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo;</i></p>\n<p>You knew this. God, did you know this.</p>\n<p>You were there, you were<i> in</i> Peter&rsquo;s head when it happened and yet some part of you still hoped that you were wrong, that the distance between Wakanda and whatever planet he was on was so great that although you were able to reach him, <i>finally</i> reach him, you had misunderstood what you had seen, what you had felt.</p>\n<p>Mr. Stark had miraculously returned to Earth two days ago and there was no news about Spider-Man being with him on the ship. No Peter Parker.</p>\n<p>The ugly vase Aunt May is so very fond of shatters and you come to your senses. Mr. Stark is in front of you, he probably should not be exerting the effort to get to your level, look you in the eye, but here he is, all skin and bones and haunted eyes. Aunt May has her hand over her chest, shocked by your powers destroying her vase, but she does not say anything.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Mr. Stark says, mouth slightly quirking upward out of habit.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;&hellip;hey,&rdquo; you say and although you really did not want to, you peaked into his mind.</p>\n<p>You never thought that you would witness someone having a moon thrown at them.</p>\n<p>Mr. Stark brings you out of his thoughts as quickly as you entered them.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Saw what you wanted?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You fought hard.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Not hard enough.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>You shake your head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your fault.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And you truly believe this. Although you really want to blame someone (and of course you can blame Thanos but he is not around to shout at) you cannot bring yourself to hate Mr. Stark.</p>\n<p>Mr. Stark nods his head and you do not need to read his mind to know that he carries Peter&rsquo;s death on his shoulders. You know that he wants you to blame him, probably why he let you in his head with no complaints.</p>\n<p>You place your hand on top of his and you push the thought of him being too skinny to the back of your mind. You focus on making sure your smile reaches your eyes and you try to calm Mr. Stark&rsquo;s mind to the best of your abilities.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Thanks for being there for him.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&hellip;</p>\n<p><i>1 Month After the Decimation</i></p>\n<p>Aunt May never thought going to the grocery would be a surreal experience. She had gotten used to waiting in long lines and conversing with the cashiers at the checkout line but ever since&hellip;well, that, life has been different. It was hard finding out her favorite cashier had disappeared along with many others but Aunt May managed.

Yet another week of waiting for the weekend and dreading your hour long classes. </p><p>You saw Ned and Peter walk in your direction and you debated on leaving your locker because Peter was with him, but decided that you\u2019d rather have all your books now instead of walking back to your locker between each class. </p><p>\u201cHey Y/N!\u201d Ned said as he was about to approach. </p><p>\u201cHey, Ned,\u201d you said kindly, giving him a short wave before closing your locker.</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d Peter said, giving you a nod in acknowledgement. You couldn\u2019t help but tilt your head in confusion. </p><p>\u201cHey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you want to come with us to get tacos after school? It\u2019s a minimum day so why not,\u201d Ned offered.</p><p>You debated going, but ultimately decided it would be way too awkward with you, Ned, and Peter.</p><p>\u201cNo thanks,\u201d you said. \u201cI think I\u2019m probably going to study.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always study,\u201d Ned said, rolling his eyes with a knowing grin. \u201cYou know you want to!\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cYeah, you should come,\u201d Peter mumbled. You shot him another confused look but he was too busy staring at his shoes. </p><p>\u201cO-Okay,\u201d you said, hesitantly. </p><p>\u201cGreat, let\u2019s meet at the bus stop after school!\u201d Ned shouted as he walked past you, leaving you dazed and confused.</p><p>You quickly walked to your next class where you knew MJ would already be sitting towards the back and sat down in the desk right next to her.</p><p>\u201cI just got myself into a mess and I don\u2019t think I can get myself out of it.\u201d Intrigued, MJ set her phone down and faced you.</p><p>\u201cAnd how can I help, little one?\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t register her sarcasm due to your internal freak-out.</p><p>\u201cNed asked me to hang out with him. Peter didn\u2019t object and suggest that I go with them.\u201d</p><p>MJ\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cOh my god,\u201d she uttered. </p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m just as confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a good thing! Now you can spend some time with Peter and show him that you\u2019re not what he thinks you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr I just prove that I\u2019m just as annoying as he thinks I am,\u201d you replied. \u201cI should just find Ned at lunch and tell him that was a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d MJ stayed. \u201cYou should go. Get to know him so you don\u2019t feel so uncomfortable during lunch. I mean, now you\u2019ll know if a friendship between you two would work out or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate it when you\u2019re right,\u201d you sighed. \u201cCan you come with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cMy cousins are in town and we\u2019re showing them around Queens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cText me updates though, okay? I need to know if I need to pick you up or if you\u2019re having the time of your life.\u201d You snorted and took out your notebook. </p><p>\u201cAs if,\u201d you replied. \u201cBut I\u2019ll text you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour life is literally the most interesting thing going on right now, Y/N.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad that I could amuse you.\u201d</p><p>*** </p><p>\u201cNo guacamole with your chips?\u201d Ned teased you as you sat down, facing the two teenagers when you put the chips down next to your soft-shelled tacos. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s allergic to avocados,\u201d Peter commented casually. You and Ned shot him a look. \u201cWhat? She never eats avocados whenever we have burritos in the cafeteria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh huh,\u201d said Ned. \u201cWell anyways, this is nice.\u201d</p><p>You awkwardly laughed. \u201cYeah, I think there\u2019s been too much crazy in my life and I just need some damn tacos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, like what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d never believed me,\u201d you muttered before taking a bite of your carne asada taco.</p><p>\u201cTry us,\u201d Ned egged on.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve had two encounters with Spider-Man and both times there didn\u2019t seem to be any danger,\u201d you said with a shrug. Ned looked at Peter with a side-eye. </p><p>\u201cS-Spider-Man, huh?\u201d Peter said. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d </p><p>You smiles down at your plate. \u201cYeah,\u201d you said softly. \u201cHe\u2019s really nice and walked me home the other day. It was kind of weird but really nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes someone have a little crush on Spider-Man?\u201d Ned teased. You laughed and threw a tortilla chip at him, which he failed to dodge. The three of you burst out laughing. </p><p>\u201cA crush? I don\u2019t think so. But it <i>is</i> pretty cool that our local superhero decided to walk me home when he didn\u2019t need to. At least, I think it\u2019s a he.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpider-Man is definitely a he,\u201d Peter said quickly. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d you said. \u201cAnyway. I don\u2019t know when I\u2019m going to see him next but I actually really like talking to him. He\u2019s really funny and kind of perceptive.\u201c</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ned said knowingly. </p><p>Internally, Peter was freaking out because he didn\u2019t know how to navigate the situation. On one hand, he wanted you to trust Spider-Man and make you feel comfortable around him, but he didn\u2019t want to tip anything off. He internally cringed at himself when he slipped up with the avocado comment and tried to not reveal anything else.</p><p>\u201cSo, uh, did you guys talk about anything interesting? Meeting Spider-Man must be pretty cool.\u201d</p><p>Your mouth grew wide with a genuine smile and Peter couldn\u2019t help but feel proud that people liked his alter ego. </p><p>\u201cA lot of things,\u201d you started. \u201cI figured that he wouldn\u2019t tell me his name so I asked him some pretty mundane questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d Ned egged on. </p><p>You gave him a look. \u201cJeez, you guys are such fanboys.\u201d Ned and Peter laughed cautiously. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s us! We love Spider-Man,\u201d said Ned. \u201cThat\u2019s really cool, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt really is,\u201d you said softly. </p><p>Peter couldn\u2019t help but love that you liked Spider-Man.</p><p>***</p><p>Peter thought about his next steps. It was almost obvious to him that you not knowing your father had tipped him off, but he wasn\u2019t sure why. Millions of children didn\u2019t have fathers and none of them made Peter anxious and worried. Even Peter admitted it was weird and didn\u2019t understand why he always felt like he needed to be on edge whenever he was around you. </p><p>\u201cI think we should ask Mr. Stark,\u201d Peter said on the way back to Ned\u2019s house. You had left ten minutes ago and Peter had been seriously thinking about helping you find your father in hopes that the nervousness he was feeling would disappear. </p><p>\u201cAsk him what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor help,\u201d Peter replied. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that he\u2019d help me out when I tell him my spidey senses have been going off the radar ever since Y/N came to town and he owes me a favor after I stayed home from school to test my new suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou call that a favor?\u201d</p><p>Peter rolled his eyes. \u201cYes, considering I actually wanted to go to school that day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, fair enough. Yeah, that\u2019s a good idea. Don\u2019t tell him you\u2018ve been visiting her, though. I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s going to take away your suit again.\u201d Peter visibly cringed and Ned laughed. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow, okay? I\u2019m gonna visit the tower and see if Mr. Stark can help.\u201d Ned mock saluted and Peter did the same, parting ways. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark!\u201d Peter yelled when he stepped out of the elevator onto the common floor. \u201cMr. Stark!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKid, what are you doing here? You\u2019re not in for training until Thursday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling in that favor now,\u201d he said as he set down his backpack on the kitchen counter and pulled out his phone to show him a photo of you. \u201cLong story short, my spidey senses have been going haywire since this girl joined Midtown tech.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this is my problem how?\u201d Tony asked, popping blueberries in his mouth. </p><p>\u201cI was wondering if you could help me because she doesn\u2019t know who her father is.\u201d </p><p>Tony\u2019s ears perked up at the mention of a fatherless girl who Peter happened to have had an encounter with. His eyebrow quirked upwards in curiosity as he took the phone from Peter\u2019s hands. The girl certainly had his hair and eyes, but Tony didn\u2019t know if he was making comparisons to fit his agenda.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d you said seriously. \u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI did not think you would say yes.\u201d Tony awkwardly laughed and gave Peter\u2019s phone back to him while rubbing his neck.</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019d do a favor for you, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Peter smiled. \u201cYeah, I guess you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the girl\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d he replied.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo you know anything about who this mystery father is?\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head. \u201cNo name or anything. All Y/N has is a birth certificate from her mother and a blank space where the father\u2019s signature is supposed to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow odd,\u201d Tony said absentmindedly. \u201cSay, Pete, why don\u2019t you bring Y/N to the tower some time this week? We can interview her and see if any of her DNA matches DNA in our system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI highly doubt she\u2019d match to anyone on The Index,\u201d Peter said with a shrug. \u201cBut at least we can rule some people out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm,\u201d Tony said, not paying much attention to what Peter was saying. Instead, he was thinking about you.</p><p>What Peter didn\u2019t know was that Tony knew he had a daughter but didn\u2019t know where she was. Seventeen years ago, he knew that the woman he once loved left without a word five months pregnant and it disheartened him to know he had a daughter out there who he didn\u2019t get the chance to know. </p><p>His then-lover had been a happy knowing that she had a daughter growing inside of her and Tony was more than happy to leave his Stark Industries enterprise role behind for someone more capable, but he threw himself into his work when the woman left without so much as a note. </p><p>Since then, Tony had kept the name of his lover a secret and his child a secret too. The world didn\u2019t need to know about a potential Stark and he didn\u2019t want enemies finding out about an innocent. </p><p>So when Peter came to him about a girl with an absent father, accompanied by the fact that his spidey senses were going of the radar, Tony didn\u2019t hesitate to find out if this lead was going to get him some answers. </p><p>\u201cFunny story, actually,\u201d Peter said with a nervous laugh. \u201cWe\u2019re not really friends but she and Spider-Man are.\u201d Tony was snapped out of his daydream. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, <i>what?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kind of visited her as Spider-Man and we did some bonding.\u201d Tony pinched the bridge of his nose. </p><p>\u201cPeter, you can\u2019t just do that. Do you know how serious that could have been? Y/N could\u2019ve guessed your identity and we don\u2019t need more people knowing you\u2019re you-know-who.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Stark. So the next time I come here with Y/N I\u2019m gonna have to be in my suit and no one can refer to me as \u2018Peter\u2019 or \u2018Parker.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, okay,\u201d said Tony, sighing. \u201cGo home and do your homework, or something.\u201d</p><p>Peter saluted Tony. \u201cThank you, sir!\u201d</p><p>When the young boy was out of earshot, Tony asked F.R.I.D.A.Y to pull up the confidential file that could only be overridden by Fury.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like to do with the file, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUpdate it, please. Title it \u201cY/N Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUpdating, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s provisional for now,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing too serious. I\u2019m following a lead and I want to know where it takes me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have full faith in you, sir.\u201d</p><p>Tony stared out the window and let out a sigh, closing the file before Clint and Natasha walked in, when Tony put on a smile and bade them a goodbye.</p><p>***</p><p>Taglist: </p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM9vm2_2UHQrZ8s3TBOow7g\">@kath94210</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7LLktNYy6UNWt2fhwblFcw\">@sessi03</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKYjtg5etd6rm4xGT18Du_w\">@olliekookie</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwEP_7csk66qTrZjx5AzmfA\">@edgyhargreeves</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mofHGs5Xh6GQ2KycelmO-GA\">@simonsbluee</a> @meraki&ndash;me <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7YoIKztmyr4NJk0Y7_CNXw\">@sleep-i-ness</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBL_lonvYbCV5pQhnddRKsg\">@amourski</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEkH8ZfEWZ_7eA_dL4de8lw\">@zaynjawy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIjo8yR2XlA2LsPinKHtpiA\">@captainlarsonn</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mj7aKD9KBSnvAvW43ebJr7A\">@katiemcrae</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2DZiccAxCLVXHhaPdaDdaA\">@holyhellthatbook</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQKmzNRIvpCQk4FrJI4gPCQ\">@madeismyname</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUQyyZjq1cC-uQ15CXbbruQ\">@bands-and-shietz</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/moUQi-KwGFY3l7syxnYWK2w\">@janndishstuff17</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGV4QVmkg8R8xHiVsJ_VTaQ\">@knightofreaders</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg5tdeFOGGykyTOOI7MHyUw\">@rororo06</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBP9gL6yrsuT8Me19fMFgXw\">@unfortunateshelby</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzcRj_f1ZB_hlPOsTGd3P5g\">@princessizzy36</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mo-HIvNK3ZuodJMLaQqeoYg\">@psychicforest</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mz-j03DHY3GcEq1-qyO2Faw\">@miss-mcbotty</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-9OIHEvtkZW-pRRs_SCoYQ\">@hardyxlove</a> @ravynnn-12 @rhyaaaaaaaaaa <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mc98E0j729WPqqnM8YVqUiw\">@fangirlingisajob</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpaIoJuo0ymRPt84Q0Fp_9A\">@mcuwillbethedeathofme</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-SZZdFT-S8f8EW-Dz4Fc-g\">@escapetheshackles</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMvQ9rYw4WRrHfzJaErRXlQ\">@sireneholland</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m47KUdfNVm7M4yqHVC1iwdA\">@gingerasaurus</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRGZpiydBfV_FMkCWMac7xQ\">@viarogers</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCrtkMM4rtyLJ0J2su_bI5g\">@ciochesono</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKnm_jKiGAX4rV-dk-JyLQg\">@justmultifandomsstuff</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjzzf82IeRy0DTWRmsbB_Hg\">@tc5322</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKCWzNDHYwYua8yRsAT6iew\">@obsessedwithrogertaylor</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRAG-KRLCv-dceL_hS78vVQ\">@cherrym4rk</a> @carolkyries <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muM9CYakeGKS_GSQqVzRCKg\">@treestarrrrrrrr</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMZ-UcXbEUMdnnMPh6_8nxA\">@legendarydazekitten</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDVtavxyn0xDxPjBeg4WYjg\">@danicarosaline</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m04JJ5Pl8G1flv7YQT8vD8g\">@green-lxght</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKnm_jKiGAX4rV-dk-JyLQg\">@justmultifandomsstuff</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbk1MbqCXninj69EroN1JDw\">@wonders-of-the-multiverse</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRYz2ua_LK7khTK30pmDvVA\">@narvvi</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVXRZb87ZNVOXL59fDv5IaA\">@sush1alien</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhRCScyoTz5S7Mw9Nj0JIQA\">@luckyyfin</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-SZZdFT-S8f8EW-Dz4Fc-g\">@escapetheshackles</a>.</p>",

Yet another week of waiting for the weekend and dreading your hour long classes. </p><p>You saw Ned and Peter walk in your direction and you debated on leaving your locker because Peter was with him, but decided that you\u2019d rather have all your books now instead of walking back to your locker between each class. </p><p>\u201cHey Y/N!\u201d Ned said as he was about to approach. </p><p>\u201cHey, Ned,\u201d you said kindly, giving him a short wave before closing your locker.</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d Peter said, giving you a nod in acknowledgement. You couldn\u2019t help but tilt your head in confusion. </p><p>\u201cHey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you want to come with us to get tacos after school? It\u2019s a minimum day so why not,\u201d Ned offered.</p><p>You debated going, but ultimately decided it would be way too awkward with you, Ned, and Peter.</p><p>\u201cNo thanks,\u201d you said. \u201cI think I\u2019m probably going to study.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always study,\u201d Ned said, rolling his eyes with a knowing grin. \u201cYou know you want to!\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cYeah, you should come,\u201d Peter mumbled. You shot him another confused look but he was too busy staring at his shoes. </p><p>\u201cO-Okay,\u201d you said, hesitantly. </p><p>\u201cGreat, let\u2019s meet at the bus stop after school!\u201d Ned shouted as he walked past you, leaving you dazed and confused.</p><p>You quickly walked to your next class where you knew MJ would already be sitting towards the back and sat down in the desk right next to her.</p><p>\u201cI just got myself into a mess and I don\u2019t think I can get myself out of it.\u201d Intrigued, MJ set her phone down and faced you.</p><p>\u201cAnd how can I help, little one?\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t register her sarcasm due to your internal freak-out.</p><p>\u201cNed asked me to hang out with him. Peter didn\u2019t object and suggest that I go with them.\u201d</p><p>MJ\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cOh my god,\u201d she uttered. </p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m just as confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a good thing! Now you can spend some time with Peter and show him that you\u2019re not what he thinks you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr I just prove that I\u2019m just as annoying as he thinks I am,\u201d you replied. \u201cI should just find Ned at lunch and tell him that was a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d MJ stayed. \u201cYou should go. Get to know him so you don\u2019t feel so uncomfortable during lunch. I mean, now you\u2019ll know if a friendship between you two would work out or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate it when you\u2019re right,\u201d you sighed. \u201cCan you come with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cMy cousins are in town and we\u2019re showing them around Queens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cText me updates though, okay? I need to know if I need to pick you up or if you\u2019re having the time of your life.\u201d You snorted and took out your notebook. </p><p>\u201cAs if,\u201d you replied. \u201cBut I\u2019ll text you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour life is literally the most interesting thing going on right now, Y/N.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad that I could amuse you.\u201d</p><p>*** </p><p>\u201cNo guacamole with your chips?\u201d Ned teased you as you sat down, facing the two teenagers when you put the chips down next to your soft-shelled tacos. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s allergic to avocados,\u201d Peter commented casually. You and Ned shot him a look. \u201cWhat? She never eats avocados whenever we have burritos in the cafeteria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh huh,\u201d said Ned. \u201cWell anyways, this is nice.\u201d</p><p>You awkwardly laughed. \u201cYeah, I think there\u2019s been too much crazy in my life and I just need some damn tacos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, like what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d never believed me,\u201d you muttered before taking a bite of your carne asada taco.</p><p>\u201cTry us,\u201d Ned egged on.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve had two encounters with Spider-Man and both times there didn\u2019t seem to be any danger,\u201d you said with a shrug. Ned looked at Peter with a side-eye. </p><p>\u201cS-Spider-Man, huh?\u201d Peter said. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d </p><p>You smiles down at your plate. \u201cYeah,\u201d you said softly. \u201cHe\u2019s really nice and walked me home the other day. It was kind of weird but really nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes someone have a little crush on Spider-Man?\u201d Ned teased. You laughed and threw a tortilla chip at him, which he failed to dodge. The three of you burst out laughing. </p><p>\u201cA crush? I don\u2019t think so. But it <i>is</i> pretty cool that our local superhero decided to walk me home when he didn\u2019t need to. At least, I think it\u2019s a he.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpider-Man is definitely a he,\u201d Peter said quickly. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d you said. \u201cAnyway. I don\u2019t know when I\u2019m going to see him next but I actually really like talking to him. He\u2019s really funny and kind of perceptive.\u201c</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ned said knowingly. </p><p>Internally, Peter was freaking out because he didn\u2019t know how to navigate the situation. On one hand, he wanted you to trust Spider-Man and make you feel comfortable around him, but he didn\u2019t want to tip anything off. He internally cringed at himself when he slipped up with the avocado comment and tried to not reveal anything else.</p><p>\u201cSo, uh, did you guys talk about anything interesting? Meeting Spider-Man must be pretty cool.\u201d</p><p>Your mouth grew wide with a genuine smile and Peter couldn\u2019t help but feel proud that people liked his alter ego. </p><p>\u201cA lot of things,\u201d you started. \u201cI figured that he wouldn\u2019t tell me his name so I asked him some pretty mundane questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d Ned egged on. </p><p>You gave him a look. \u201cJeez, you guys are such fanboys.\u201d Ned and Peter laughed cautiously. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s us! We love Spider-Man,\u201d said Ned. \u201cThat\u2019s really cool, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt really is,\u201d you said softly. </p><p>Peter couldn\u2019t help but love that you liked Spider-Man.</p><p>***</p><p>Peter thought about his next steps. It was almost obvious to him that you not knowing your father had tipped him off, but he wasn\u2019t sure why. Millions of children didn\u2019t have fathers and none of them made Peter anxious and worried. Even Peter admitted it was weird and didn\u2019t understand why he always felt like he needed to be on edge whenever he was around you. </p><p>\u201cI think we should ask Mr. Stark,\u201d Peter said on the way back to Ned\u2019s house. You had left ten minutes ago and Peter had been seriously thinking about helping you find your father in hopes that the nervousness he was feeling would disappear. </p><p>\u201cAsk him what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor help,\u201d Peter replied. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that he\u2019d help me out when I tell him my spidey senses have been going off the radar ever since Y/N came to town and he owes me a favor after I stayed home from school to test my new suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou call that a favor?\u201d</p><p>Peter rolled his eyes. \u201cYes, considering I actually wanted to go to school that day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, fair enough. Yeah, that\u2019s a good idea. Don\u2019t tell him you\u2018ve been visiting her, though. I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s going to take away your suit again.\u201d Peter visibly cringed and Ned laughed. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow, okay? I\u2019m gonna visit the tower and see if Mr. Stark can help.\u201d Ned mock saluted and Peter did the same, parting ways. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark!\u201d Peter yelled when he stepped out of the elevator onto the common floor. \u201cMr. Stark!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKid, what are you doing here? You\u2019re not in for training until Thursday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling in that favor now,\u201d he said as he set down his backpack on the kitchen counter and pulled out his phone to show him a photo of you. \u201cLong story short, my spidey senses have been going haywire since this girl joined Midtown tech.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this is my problem how?\u201d Tony asked, popping blueberries in his mouth. </p><p>\u201cI was wondering if you could help me because she doesn\u2019t know who her father is.\u201d </p><p>Tony\u2019s ears perked up at the mention of a fatherless girl who Peter happened to have had an encounter with. His eyebrow quirked upwards in curiosity as he took the phone from Peter\u2019s hands. The girl certainly had his hair and eyes, but Tony didn\u2019t know if he was making comparisons to fit his agenda.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d you said seriously. \u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI did not think you would say yes.\u201d Tony awkwardly laughed and gave Peter\u2019s phone back to him while rubbing his neck.</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019d do a favor for you, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Peter smiled. \u201cYeah, I guess you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the girl\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d he replied.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo you know anything about who this mystery father is?\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head. \u201cNo name or anything. All Y/N has is a birth certificate from her mother and a blank space where the father\u2019s signature is supposed to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow odd,\u201d Tony said absentmindedly. \u201cSay, Pete, why don\u2019t you bring Y/N to the tower some time this week? We can interview her and see if any of her DNA matches DNA in our system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI highly doubt she\u2019d match to anyone on The Index,\u201d Peter said with a shrug. \u201cBut at least we can rule some people out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm,\u201d Tony said, not paying much attention to what Peter was saying. Instead, he was thinking about you.</p><p>What Peter didn\u2019t know was that Tony knew he had a daughter but didn\u2019t know where she was. Seventeen years ago, he knew that the woman he once loved left without a word five months pregnant and it disheartened him to know he had a daughter out there who he didn\u2019t get the chance to know. </p><p>His then-lover had been a happy knowing that she had a daughter growing inside of her and Tony was more than happy to leave his Stark Industries enterprise role behind for someone more capable, but he threw himself into his work when the woman left without so much as a note. </p><p>Since then, Tony had kept the name of his lover a secret and his child a secret too. The world didn\u2019t need to know about a potential Stark and he didn\u2019t want enemies finding out about an innocent. </p><p>So when Peter came to him about a girl with an absent father, accompanied by the fact that his spidey senses were going of the radar, Tony didn\u2019t hesitate to find out if this lead was going to get him some answers. </p><p>\u201cFunny story, actually,\u201d Peter said with a nervous laugh. \u201cWe\u2019re not really friends but she and Spider-Man are.\u201d Tony was snapped out of his daydream. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, <i>what?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kind of visited her as Spider-Man and we did some bonding.\u201d Tony pinched the bridge of his nose. </p><p>\u201cPeter, you can\u2019t just do that. Do you know how serious that could have been? Y/N could\u2019ve guessed your identity and we don\u2019t need more people knowing you\u2019re you-know-who.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Stark. So the next time I come here with Y/N I\u2019m gonna have to be in my suit and no one can refer to me as \u2018Peter\u2019 or \u2018Parker.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, okay,\u201d said Tony, sighing. \u201cGo home and do your homework, or something.\u201d</p><p>Peter saluted Tony. \u201cThank you, sir!\u201d</p><p>When the young boy was out of earshot, Tony asked F.R.I.D.A.Y to pull up the confidential file that could only be overridden by Fury.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like to do with the file, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUpdate it, please. Title it \u201cY/N Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUpdating, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s provisional for now,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing too serious. I\u2019m following a lead and I want to know where it takes me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have full faith in you, sir.\u201d</p><p>Tony stared out the window and let out a sigh, closing the file before Clint and Natasha walked in, when Tony put on a smile and bade them a goodbye.</p><p>***</p><p>Taglist: </p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM9vm2_2UHQrZ8s3TBOow7g\">@kath94210</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7LLktNYy6UNWt2fhwblFcw\">@sessi03</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKYjtg5etd6rm4xGT18Du_w\">@olliekookie</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwEP_7csk66qTrZjx5AzmfA\">@edgyhargreeves</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mofHGs5Xh6GQ2KycelmO-GA\">@simonsbluee</a> @meraki\u2013me <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7YoIKztmyr4NJk0Y7_CNXw\">@sleep-i-ness</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBL_lonvYbCV5pQhnddRKsg\">@amourski</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEkH8ZfEWZ_7eA_dL4de8lw\">@zaynjawy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIjo8yR2XlA2LsPinKHtpiA\">@captainlarsonn</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mj7aKD9KBSnvAvW43ebJr7A\">@katiemcrae</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2DZiccAxCLVXHhaPdaDdaA\">@holyhellthatbook</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQKmzNRIvpCQk4FrJI4gPCQ\">@madeismyname</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUQyyZjq1cC-uQ15CXbbruQ\">@bands-and-shietz</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/moUQi-KwGFY3l7syxnYWK2w\">@janndishstuff17</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGV4QVmkg8R8xHiVsJ_VTaQ\">@knightofreaders</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg5tdeFOGGykyTOOI7MHyUw\">@rororo06</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBP9gL6yrsuT8Me19fMFgXw\">@unfortunateshelby</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzcRj_f1ZB_hlPOsTGd3P5g\">@princessizzy36</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mo-HIvNK3ZuodJMLaQqeoYg\">@psychicforest</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mz-j03DHY3GcEq1-qyO2Faw\">@miss-mcbotty</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-9OIHEvtkZW-pRRs_SCoYQ\">@hardyxlove</a> @ravynnn-12 @rhyaaaaaaaaaa <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mc98E0j729WPqqnM8YVqUiw\">@fangirlingisajob</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpaIoJuo0ymRPt84Q0Fp_9A\">@mcuwillbethedeathofme</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-SZZdFT-S8f8EW-Dz4Fc-g\">@escapetheshackles</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMvQ9rYw4WRrHfzJaErRXlQ\">@sireneholland</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m47KUdfNVm7M4yqHVC1iwdA\">@gingerasaurus</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRGZpiydBfV_FMkCWMac7xQ\">@viarogers</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCrtkMM4rtyLJ0J2su_bI5g\">@ciochesono</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKnm_jKiGAX4rV-dk-JyLQg\">@justmultifandomsstuff</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjzzf82IeRy0DTWRmsbB_Hg\">@tc5322</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKCWzNDHYwYua8yRsAT6iew\">@obsessedwithrogertaylor</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRAG-KRLCv-dceL_hS78vVQ\">@cherrym4rk</a> @carolkyries <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muM9CYakeGKS_GSQqVzRCKg\">@treestarrrrrrrr</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMZ-UcXbEUMdnnMPh6_8nxA\">@legendarydazekitten</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDVtavxyn0xDxPjBeg4WYjg\">@danicarosaline</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m04JJ5Pl8G1flv7YQT8vD8g\">@green-lxght</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKnm_jKiGAX4rV-dk-JyLQg\">@justmultifandomsstuff</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbk1MbqCXninj69EroN1JDw\">@wonders-of-the-multiverse</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRYz2ua_LK7khTK30pmDvVA\">@narvvi</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVXRZb87ZNVOXL59fDv5IaA\">@sush1alien</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhRCScyoTz5S7Mw9Nj0JIQA\">@luckyyfin</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-SZZdFT-S8f8EW-Dz4Fc-g\">@escapetheshackles</a>.</p></p>",

Yet another week of waiting for the weekend and dreading your hour long classes. </p><p>You saw Ned and Peter walk in your direction and you debated on leaving your locker because Peter was with him, but decided that you\u2019d rather have all your books now instead of walking back to your locker between each class. </p><p>\u201cHey Y/N!\u201d Ned said as he was about to approach. </p><p>\u201cHey, Ned,\u201d you said kindly, giving him a short wave before closing your locker.</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d Peter said, giving you a nod in acknowledgement. You couldn\u2019t help but tilt your head in confusion. </p><p>\u201cHey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you want to come with us to get tacos after school? It\u2019s a minimum day so why not,\u201d Ned offered.</p><p>You debated going, but ultimately decided it would be way too awkward with you, Ned, and Peter.</p><p>\u201cNo thanks,\u201d you said. \u201cI think I\u2019m probably going to study.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always study,\u201d Ned said, rolling his eyes with a knowing grin. \u201cYou know you want to!\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cYeah, you should come,\u201d Peter mumbled. You shot him another confused look but he was too busy staring at his shoes. </p><p>\u201cO-Okay,\u201d you said, hesitantly. </p><p>\u201cGreat, let\u2019s meet at the bus stop after school!\u201d Ned shouted as he walked past you, leaving you dazed and confused.</p><p>You quickly walked to your next class where you knew MJ would already be sitting towards the back and sat down in the desk right next to her.</p><p>\u201cI just got myself into a mess and I don\u2019t think I can get myself out of it.\u201d Intrigued, MJ set her phone down and faced you.</p><p>\u201cAnd how can I help, little one?\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t register her sarcasm due to your internal freak-out.</p><p>\u201cNed asked me to hang out with him. Peter didn\u2019t object and suggest that I go with them.\u201d</p><p>MJ\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cOh my god,\u201d she uttered. </p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m just as confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a good thing! Now you can spend some time with Peter and show him that you\u2019re not what he thinks you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr I just prove that I\u2019m just as annoying as he thinks I am,\u201d you replied. \u201cI should just find Ned at lunch and tell him that was a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d MJ stayed. \u201cYou should go. Get to know him so you don\u2019t feel so uncomfortable during lunch. I mean, now you\u2019ll know if a friendship between you two would work out or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate it when you\u2019re right,\u201d you sighed. \u201cCan you come with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cMy cousins are in town and we\u2019re showing them around Queens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cText me updates though, okay? I need to know if I need to pick you up or if you\u2019re having the time of your life.\u201d You snorted and took out your notebook. </p><p>\u201cAs if,\u201d you replied. \u201cBut I\u2019ll text you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour life is literally the most interesting thing going on right now, Y/N.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad that I could amuse you.\u201d</p><p>*** </p><p>\u201cNo guacamole with your chips?\u201d Ned teased you as you sat down, facing the two teenagers when you put the chips down next to your soft-shelled tacos. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s allergic to avocados,\u201d Peter commented casually. You and Ned shot him a look. \u201cWhat? She never eats avocados whenever we have burritos in the cafeteria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh huh,\u201d said Ned. \u201cWell anyways, this is nice.\u201d</p><p>You awkwardly laughed. \u201cYeah, I think there\u2019s been too much crazy in my life and I just need some damn tacos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, like what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d never believed me,\u201d you muttered before taking a bite of your carne asada taco.</p><p>\u201cTry us,\u201d Ned egged on.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve had two encounters with Spider-Man and both times there didn\u2019t seem to be any danger,\u201d you said with a shrug. Ned looked at Peter with a side-eye. </p><p>\u201cS-Spider-Man, huh?\u201d Peter said. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d </p><p>You smiles down at your plate. \u201cYeah,\u201d you said softly. \u201cHe\u2019s really nice and walked me home the other day. It was kind of weird but really nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes someone have a little crush on Spider-Man?\u201d Ned teased. You laughed and threw a tortilla chip at him, which he failed to dodge. The three of you burst out laughing. </p><p>\u201cA crush? I don\u2019t think so. But it <i>is</i> pretty cool that our local superhero decided to walk me home when he didn\u2019t need to. At least, I think it\u2019s a he.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpider-Man is definitely a he,\u201d Peter said quickly. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d you said. \u201cAnyway. I don\u2019t know when I\u2019m going to see him next but I actually really like talking to him. He\u2019s really funny and kind of perceptive.\u201c</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ned said knowingly. </p><p>Internally, Peter was freaking out because he didn\u2019t know how to navigate the situation. On one hand, he wanted you to trust Spider-Man and make you feel comfortable around him, but he didn\u2019t want to tip anything off. He internally cringed at himself when he slipped up with the avocado comment and tried to not reveal anything else.</p><p>\u201cSo, uh, did you guys talk about anything interesting? Meeting Spider-Man must be pretty cool.\u201d</p><p>Your mouth grew wide with a genuine smile and Peter couldn\u2019t help but feel proud that people liked his alter ego. </p><p>\u201cA lot of things,\u201d you started. \u201cI figured that he wouldn\u2019t tell me his name so I asked him some pretty mundane questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d Ned egged on. </p><p>You gave him a look. \u201cJeez, you guys are such fanboys.\u201d Ned and Peter laughed cautiously. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s us! We love Spider-Man,\u201d said Ned. \u201cThat\u2019s really cool, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt really is,\u201d you said softly. </p><p>Peter couldn\u2019t help but love that you liked Spider-Man.</p><p>***</p><p>Peter thought about his next steps. It was almost obvious to him that you not knowing your father had tipped him off, but he wasn\u2019t sure why. Millions of children didn\u2019t have fathers and none of them made Peter anxious and worried. Even Peter admitted it was weird and didn\u2019t understand why he always felt like he needed to be on edge whenever he was around you. </p><p>\u201cI think we should ask Mr. Stark,\u201d Peter said on the way back to Ned\u2019s house. You had left ten minutes ago and Peter had been seriously thinking about helping you find your father in hopes that the nervousness he was feeling would disappear. </p><p>\u201cAsk him what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor help,\u201d Peter replied. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that he\u2019d help me out when I tell him my spidey senses have been going off the radar ever since Y/N came to town and he owes me a favor after I stayed home from school to test my new suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou call that a favor?\u201d</p><p>Peter rolled his eyes. \u201cYes, considering I actually wanted to go to school that day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, fair enough. Yeah, that\u2019s a good idea. Don\u2019t tell him you\u2018ve been visiting her, though. I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s going to take away your suit again.\u201d Peter visibly cringed and Ned laughed. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow, okay? I\u2019m gonna visit the tower and see if Mr. Stark can help.\u201d Ned mock saluted and Peter did the same, parting ways. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark!\u201d Peter yelled when he stepped out of the elevator onto the common floor. \u201cMr. Stark!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKid, what are you doing here? You\u2019re not in for training until Thursday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling in that favor now,\u201d he said as he set down his backpack on the kitchen counter and pulled out his phone to show him a photo of you. \u201cLong story short, my spidey senses have been going haywire since this girl joined Midtown tech.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this is my problem how?\u201d Tony asked, popping blueberries in his mouth. </p><p>\u201cI was wondering if you could help me because she doesn\u2019t know who her father is.\u201d </p><p>Tony\u2019s ears perked up at the mention of a fatherless girl who Peter happened to have had an encounter with. His eyebrow quirked upwards in curiosity as he took the phone from Peter\u2019s hands. The girl certainly had his hair and eyes, but Tony didn\u2019t know if he was making comparisons to fit his agenda.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d you said seriously. \u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI did not think you would say yes.\u201d Tony awkwardly laughed and gave Peter\u2019s phone back to him while rubbing his neck.</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019d do a favor for you, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Peter smiled. \u201cYeah, I guess you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the girl\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d he replied.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo you know anything about who this mystery father is?\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head. \u201cNo name or anything. All Y/N has is a birth certificate from her mother and a blank space where the father\u2019s signature is supposed to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow odd,\u201d Tony said absentmindedly. \u201cSay, Pete, why don\u2019t you bring Y/N to the tower some time this week? We can interview her and see if any of her DNA matches DNA in our system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI highly doubt she\u2019d match to anyone on The Index,\u201d Peter said with a shrug. \u201cBut at least we can rule some people out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm,\u201d Tony said, not paying much attention to what Peter was saying. Instead, he was thinking about you.</p><p>What Peter didn\u2019t know was that Tony knew he had a daughter but didn\u2019t know where she was. Seventeen years ago, he knew that the woman he once loved left without a word five months pregnant and it disheartened him to know he had a daughter out there who he didn\u2019t get the chance to know. </p><p>His then-lover had been a happy knowing that she had a daughter growing inside of her and Tony was more than happy to leave his Stark Industries enterprise role behind for someone more capable, but he threw himself into his work when the woman left without so much as a note. </p><p>Since then, Tony had kept the name of his lover a secret and his child a secret too. The world didn\u2019t need to know about a potential Stark and he didn\u2019t want enemies finding out about an innocent. </p><p>So when Peter came to him about a girl with an absent father, accompanied by the fact that his spidey senses were going of the radar, Tony didn\u2019t hesitate to find out if this lead was going to get him some answers. </p><p>\u201cFunny story, actually,\u201d Peter said with a nervous laugh. \u201cWe\u2019re not really friends but she and Spider-Man are.\u201d Tony was snapped out of his daydream. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, <i>what?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kind of visited her as Spider-Man and we did some bonding.\u201d Tony pinched the bridge of his nose. </p><p>\u201cPeter, you can\u2019t just do that. Do you know how serious that could have been? Y/N could\u2019ve guessed your identity and we don\u2019t need more people knowing you\u2019re you-know-who.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Stark. So the next time I come here with Y/N I\u2019m gonna have to be in my suit and no one can refer to me as \u2018Peter\u2019 or \u2018Parker.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, okay,\u201d said Tony, sighing. \u201cGo home and do your homework, or something.\u201d</p><p>Peter saluted Tony. \u201cThank you, sir!\u201d</p><p>When the young boy was out of earshot, Tony asked F.R.I.D.A.Y to pull up the confidential file that could only be overridden by Fury.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like to do with the file, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUpdate it, please. Title it \u201cY/N Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUpdating, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s provisional for now,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing too serious. I\u2019m following a lead and I want to know where it takes me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have full faith in you, sir.\u201d</p><p>Tony stared out the window and let out a sigh, closing the file before Clint and Natasha walked in, when Tony put on a smile and bade them a goodbye.</p><p>***</p><p>Taglist: </p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM9vm2_2UHQrZ8s3TBOow7g\">@kath94210</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7LLktNYy6UNWt2fhwblFcw\">@sessi03</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKYjtg5etd6rm4xGT18Du_w\">@olliekookie</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwEP_7csk66qTrZjx5AzmfA\">@edgyhargreeves</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mofHGs5Xh6GQ2KycelmO-GA\">@simonsbluee</a> @meraki\u2013me <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7YoIKztmyr4NJk0Y7_CNXw\">@sleep-i-ness</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBL_lonvYbCV5pQhnddRKsg\">@amourski</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEkH8ZfEWZ_7eA_dL4de8lw\">@zaynjawy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIjo8yR2XlA2LsPinKHtpiA\">@captainlarsonn</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mj7aKD9KBSnvAvW43ebJr7A\">@katiemcrae</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2DZiccAxCLVXHhaPdaDdaA\">@holyhellthatbook</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQKmzNRIvpCQk4FrJI4gPCQ\">@madeismyname</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUQyyZjq1cC-uQ15CXbbruQ\">@bands-and-shietz</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/moUQi-KwGFY3l7syxnYWK2w\">@janndishstuff17</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGV4QVmkg8R8xHiVsJ_VTaQ\">@knightofreaders</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg5tdeFOGGykyTOOI7MHyUw\">@rororo06</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBP9gL6yrsuT8Me19fMFgXw\">@unfortunateshelby</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzcRj_f1ZB_hlPOsTGd3P5g\">@princessizzy36</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mo-HIvNK3ZuodJMLaQqeoYg\">@psychicforest</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mz-j03DHY3GcEq1-qyO2Faw\">@miss-mcbotty</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-9OIHEvtkZW-pRRs_SCoYQ\">@hardyxlove</a> @ravynnn-12 @rhyaaaaaaaaaa <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mc98E0j729WPqqnM8YVqUiw\">@fangirlingisajob</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpaIoJuo0ymRPt84Q0Fp_9A\">@mcuwillbethedeathofme</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-SZZdFT-S8f8EW-Dz4Fc-g\">@escapetheshackles</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMvQ9rYw4WRrHfzJaErRXlQ\">@sireneholland</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m47KUdfNVm7M4yqHVC1iwdA\">@gingerasaurus</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRGZpiydBfV_FMkCWMac7xQ\">@viarogers</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCrtkMM4rtyLJ0J2su_bI5g\">@ciochesono</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKnm_jKiGAX4rV-dk-JyLQg\">@justmultifandomsstuff</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjzzf82IeRy0DTWRmsbB_Hg\">@tc5322</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKCWzNDHYwYua8yRsAT6iew\">@obsessedwithrogertaylor</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRAG-KRLCv-dceL_hS78vVQ\">@cherrym4rk</a> @carolkyries <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muM9CYakeGKS_GSQqVzRCKg\">@treestarrrrrrrr</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMZ-UcXbEUMdnnMPh6_8nxA\">@legendarydazekitten</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDVtavxyn0xDxPjBeg4WYjg\">@danicarosaline</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m04JJ5Pl8G1flv7YQT8vD8g\">@green-lxght</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKnm_jKiGAX4rV-dk-JyLQg\">@justmultifandomsstuff</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbk1MbqCXninj69EroN1JDw\">@wonders-of-the-multiverse</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRYz2ua_LK7khTK30pmDvVA\">@narvvi</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVXRZb87ZNVOXL59fDv5IaA\">@sush1alien</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhRCScyoTz5S7Mw9Nj0JIQA\">@luckyyfin</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-SZZdFT-S8f8EW-Dz4Fc-g\">@escapetheshackles</a>.</p></p>",

You shot him another confused look but he was too busy staring at his shoes. </p><p>&ldquo;O-Okay,&rdquo; you said, hesitantly. </p><p>&ldquo;Great, let&rsquo;s meet at the bus stop after school!&rdquo; Ned shouted as he walked past you, leaving you dazed and confused.</p><p>You quickly walked to your next class where you knew MJ would already be sitting towards the back and sat down in the desk right next to her.</p><p>&ldquo;I just got myself into a mess and I don&rsquo;t think I can get myself out of it.&rdquo; Intrigued, MJ set her phone down and faced you.</p><p>&ldquo;And how can I help, little one?&rdquo;</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t register her sarcasm due to your internal freak-out.</p><p>&ldquo;Ned asked me to hang out with him. Peter didn&rsquo;t object and suggest that I go with them.&rdquo;</p><p>MJ&rsquo;s eyes widened. &ldquo;Oh my god,&rdquo; she uttered. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m just as confused.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This is a good thing! Now you can spend some time with Peter and show him that you&rsquo;re not what he thinks you are.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Or I just prove that I&rsquo;m just as annoying as he thinks I am,&rdquo; you replied. &ldquo;I should just find Ned at lunch and tell him that was a bad idea.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; MJ stayed. &ldquo;You should go. Get to know him so you don&rsquo;t feel so uncomfortable during lunch. I mean, now you&rsquo;ll know if a friendship between you two would work out or not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hate it when you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; you sighed. &ldquo;Can you come with me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My cousins are in town and we&rsquo;re showing them around Queens.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; you said.</p><p>&ldquo;Text me updates though, okay? I need to know if I need to pick you up or if you&rsquo;re having the time of your life.&rdquo; You snorted and took out your notebook. </p><p>&ldquo;As if,&rdquo; you replied. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll text you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your life is literally the most interesting thing going on right now, Y/N.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad that I could amuse you.&rdquo;</p><p>*** </p><p>&ldquo;No guacamole with your chips?&rdquo; Ned teased you as you sat down, facing the two teenagers when you put the chips down next to your soft-shelled tacos. </p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s allergic to avocados,&rdquo; Peter commented casually. You and Ned shot him a look. &ldquo;What? She never eats avocados whenever we have burritos in the cafeteria.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh huh,&rdquo; said Ned. &ldquo;Well anyways, this is nice.&rdquo;</p><p>You awkwardly laughed. &ldquo;Yeah, I think there&rsquo;s been too much crazy in my life and I just need some damn tacos.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, like what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d never believed me,&rdquo; you muttered before taking a bite of your carne asada taco.</p><p>&ldquo;Try us,&rdquo; Ned egged on.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve had two encounters with Spider-Man and both times there didn&rsquo;t seem to be any danger,&rdquo; you said with a shrug. Ned looked at Peter with a side-eye. </p><p>&ldquo;S-Spider-Man, huh?&rdquo; Peter said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s pretty cool.&rdquo; </p><p>You smiles down at your plate. &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; you said softly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s really nice and walked me home the other day. It was kind of weird but really nice.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Does someone have a little crush on Spider-Man?&rdquo; Ned teased. You laughed and threw a tortilla chip at him, which he failed to dodge. The three of you burst out laughing. </p><p>&ldquo;A crush? I don&rsquo;t think so. But it <i>is</i> pretty cool that our local superhero decided to walk me home when he didn&rsquo;t need to. At least, I think it&rsquo;s a he.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Spider-Man is definitely a he,&rdquo; Peter said quickly. &ldquo;I mean, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve heard.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; you said. &ldquo;Anyway. I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;m going to see him next but I actually really like talking to him. He&rsquo;s really funny and kind of perceptive.&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Ned said knowingly. </p><p>Internally, Peter was freaking out because he didn&rsquo;t know how to navigate the situation. On one hand, he wanted you to trust Spider-Man and make you feel comfortable around him, but he didn&rsquo;t want to tip anything off. He internally cringed at himself when he slipped up with the avocado comment and tried to not reveal anything else.</p><p>&ldquo;So, uh, did you guys talk about anything interesting? Meeting Spider-Man must be pretty cool.&rdquo;</p><p>Your mouth grew wide with a genuine smile and Peter couldn&rsquo;t help but feel proud that people liked his alter ego. </p><p>&ldquo;A lot of things,&rdquo; you started. &ldquo;I figured that he wouldn&rsquo;t tell me his name so I asked him some pretty mundane questions.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo; Ned egged on. </p><p>You gave him a look. &ldquo;Jeez, you guys are such fanboys.&rdquo; Ned and Peter laughed cautiously. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s us! We love Spider-Man,&rdquo; said Ned. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s really cool, Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It really is,&rdquo; you said softly. </p><p>Peter couldn&rsquo;t help but love that you liked Spider-Man.</p><p>***</p><p>Peter thought about his next steps. It was almost obvious to him that you not knowing your father had tipped him off, but he wasn&rsquo;t sure why. Millions of children didn&rsquo;t have fathers and none of them made Peter anxious and worried. Even Peter admitted it was weird and didn&rsquo;t understand why he always felt like he needed to be on edge whenever he was around you. </p><p>&ldquo;I think we should ask Mr. Stark,&rdquo; Peter said on the way back to Ned&rsquo;s house. You had left ten minutes ago and Peter had been seriously thinking about helping you find your father in hopes that the nervousness he was feeling would disappear. </p><p>&ldquo;Ask him what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For help,&rdquo; Peter replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure that he&rsquo;d help me out when I tell him my spidey senses have been going off the radar ever since Y/N came to town and he owes me a favor after I stayed home from school to test my new suit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You call that a favor?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter rolled his eyes. &ldquo;Yes, considering I actually wanted to go to school that day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, fair enough. Yeah, that&rsquo;s a good idea. Don&rsquo;t tell him you&lsquo;ve been visiting her, though. I&rsquo;m pretty sure he&rsquo;s going to take away your suit again.&rdquo; Peter visibly cringed and Ned laughed. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow, okay? I&rsquo;m gonna visit the tower and see if Mr. Stark can help.&rdquo; Ned mock saluted and Peter did the same, parting ways. </p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark!&rdquo; Peter yelled when he stepped out of the elevator onto the common floor. &ldquo;Mr. Stark!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kid, what are you doing here? You&rsquo;re not in for training until Thursday.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m calling in that favor now,&rdquo; he said as he set down his backpack on the kitchen counter and pulled out his phone to show him a photo of you. &ldquo;Long story short, my spidey senses have been going haywire since this girl joined Midtown tech.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And this is my problem how?&rdquo; Tony asked, popping blueberries in his mouth. </p><p>&ldquo;I was wondering if you could help me because she doesn&rsquo;t know who her father is.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony&rsquo;s ears perked up at the mention of a fatherless girl who Peter happened to have had an encounter with. His eyebrow quirked upwards in curiosity as he took the phone from Peter&rsquo;s hands. The girl certainly had his hair and eyes, but Tony didn&rsquo;t know if he was making comparisons to fit his agenda.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; you said seriously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes widened. &ldquo;I did not think you would say yes.&rdquo; Tony awkwardly laughed and gave Peter&rsquo;s phone back to him while rubbing his neck.</p><p>&ldquo;I said I&rsquo;d do a favor for you, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter smiled. &ldquo;Yeah, I guess you did.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the girl&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N,&rdquo; he replied.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Do you know anything about who this mystery father is?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shook his head. &ldquo;No name or anything. All Y/N has is a birth certificate from her mother and a blank space where the father&rsquo;s signature is supposed to be.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How odd,&rdquo; Tony said absentmindedly. &ldquo;Say, Pete, why don&rsquo;t you bring Y/N to the tower some time this week? We can interview her and see if any of her DNA matches DNA in our system.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I highly doubt she&rsquo;d match to anyone on The Index,&rdquo; Peter said with a shrug. &ldquo;But at least we can rule some people out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mhm,&rdquo; Tony said, not paying much attention to what Peter was saying. Instead, he was thinking about you.</p><p>What Peter didn&rsquo;t know was that Tony knew he had a daughter but didn&rsquo;t know where she was. Seventeen years ago, he knew that the woman he once loved left without a word five months pregnant and it disheartened him to know he had a daughter out there who he didn&rsquo;t get the chance to know. </p><p>His then-lover had been a happy knowing that she had a daughter growing inside of her and Tony was more than happy to leave his Stark Industries enterprise role behind for someone more capable, but he threw himself into his work when the woman left without so much as a note. </p><p>Since then, Tony had kept the name of his lover a secret and his child a secret too. The world didn&rsquo;t need to know about a potential Stark and he didn&rsquo;t want enemies finding out about an innocent. </p><p>So when Peter came to him about a girl with an absent father, accompanied by the fact that his spidey senses were going of the radar, Tony didn&rsquo;t hesitate to find out if this lead was going to get him some answers. </p><p>&ldquo;Funny story, actually,&rdquo; Peter said with a nervous laugh. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not really friends but she and Spider-Man are.&rdquo; Tony was snapped out of his daydream. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, <i>what?</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I kind of visited her as Spider-Man and we did some bonding.&rdquo; Tony pinched the bridge of his nose. </p><p>&ldquo;Peter, you can&rsquo;t just do that. Do you know how serious that could have been? Y/N could&rsquo;ve guessed your identity and we don&rsquo;t need more people knowing you&rsquo;re you-know-who.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Mr. Stark. So the next time I come here with Y/N I&rsquo;m gonna have to be in my suit and no one can refer to me as &lsquo;Peter&rsquo; or &lsquo;Parker.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jeez, okay,&rdquo; said Tony, sighing. &ldquo;Go home and do your homework, or something.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter saluted Tony. &ldquo;Thank you, sir!&rdquo;</p><p>When the young boy was out of earshot, Tony asked F.R.I.D.A.Y to pull up the confidential file that could only be overridden by Fury.</p><p>&ldquo;What would you like to do with the file, sir?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Update it, please. Title it &ldquo;Y/N Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Updating, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s provisional for now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Nothing too serious. I&rsquo;m following a lead and I want to know where it takes me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have full faith in you, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony stared out the window and let out a sigh, closing the file before Clint and Natasha walked in, when Tony put on a smile and bade them a goodbye.</p><p>***</p><p>Taglist: </p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM9vm2_2UHQrZ8s3TBOow7g\">@kath94210</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7LLktNYy6UNWt2fhwblFcw\">@sessi03</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKYjtg5etd6rm4xGT18Du_w\">@olliekookie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwEP_7csk66qTrZjx5AzmfA\">@edgyhargreeves</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mofHGs5Xh6GQ2KycelmO-GA\">@simonsbluee</a> @meraki&ndash;me <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7YoIKztmyr4NJk0Y7_CNXw\">@sleep-i-ness</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBL_lonvYbCV5pQhnddRKsg\">@amourski</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEkH8ZfEWZ_7eA_dL4de8lw\">@zaynjawy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIjo8yR2XlA2LsPinKHtpiA\">@captainlarsonn</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mj7aKD9KBSnvAvW43ebJr7A\">@katiemcrae</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2DZiccAxCLVXHhaPdaDdaA\">@holyhellthatbook</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQKmzNRIvpCQk4FrJI4gPCQ\">@madeismyname</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUQyyZjq1cC-uQ15CXbbruQ\">@bands-and-shietz</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/moUQi-KwGFY3l7syxnYWK2w\">@janndishstuff17</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGV4QVmkg8R8xHiVsJ_VTaQ\">@knightofreaders</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg5tdeFOGGykyTOOI7MHyUw\">@rororo06</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBP9gL6yrsuT8Me19fMFgXw\">@unfortunateshelby</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzcRj_f1ZB_hlPOsTGd3P5g\">@princessizzy36</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mo-HIvNK3ZuodJMLaQqeoYg\">@psychicforest</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mz-j03DHY3GcEq1-qyO2Faw\">@miss-mcbotty</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-9OIHEvtkZW-pRRs_SCoYQ\">@hardyxlove</a> @ravynnn-12 @rhyaaaaaaaaaa <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mc98E0j729WPqqnM8YVqUiw\">@fangirlingisajob</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpaIoJuo0ymRPt84Q0Fp_9A\">@mcuwillbethedeathofme</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-SZZdFT-S8f8EW-Dz4Fc-g\">@escapetheshackles</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMvQ9rYw4WRrHfzJaErRXlQ\">@sireneholland</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m47KUdfNVm7M4yqHVC1iwdA\">@gingerasaurus</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRGZpiydBfV_FMkCWMac7xQ\">@viarogers</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCrtkMM4rtyLJ0J2su_bI5g\">@ciochesono</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKnm_jKiGAX4rV-dk-JyLQg\">@justmultifandomsstuff</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjzzf82IeRy0DTWRmsbB_Hg\">@tc5322</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKCWzNDHYwYua8yRsAT6iew\">@obsessedwithrogertaylor</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRAG-KRLCv-dceL_hS78vVQ\">@cherrym4rk</a> @carolkyries <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muM9CYakeGKS_GSQqVzRCKg\">@treestarrrrrrrr</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMZ-UcXbEUMdnnMPh6_8nxA\">@legendarydazekitten</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDVtavxyn0xDxPjBeg4WYjg\">@danicarosaline</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m04JJ5Pl8G1flv7YQT8vD8g\">@green-lxght</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKnm_jKiGAX4rV-dk-JyLQg\">@justmultifandomsstuff</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbk1MbqCXninj69EroN1JDw\">@wonders-of-the-multiverse</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRYz2ua_LK7khTK30pmDvVA\">@narvvi</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVXRZb87ZNVOXL59fDv5IaA\">@sush1alien</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhRCScyoTz5S7Mw9Nj0JIQA\">@luckyyfin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-SZZdFT-S8f8EW-Dz4Fc-g\">@escapetheshackles</a>.</p></p>",
