She was bigger than any of them, stronger, swifter, faster. She could outrun horses and outfight lions. When she bared her teeth even men would run from her, her belly was never empty long, and her fur kept her warm even when the wind was blowing cold. <b><i>And her brothers and sisters were with her, many and more of them, fierce and terrible and hers.
