The only conclusion people seem to come up with is that Sansa really, really likes the Lannister. The real conclusion is Sansa felt betrayed by her father and is lashing out.</p><p>Sansa doesn\u2019t break rules. She is a good girl in her words. She does what is expected of her very well to the point that her parents rarely worry or wonder about her. The first instances of Sansa behaving less than perfectly were her feeding Lady under the table. It\u2019s clear that Sansa spends a lot of time with her direwolf. Lady is well trained, clean and is often with Sansa. At this point, this is the extent of Sansa\u2019s pre teen rebellion, that she sometimes feeds her pet in an inappropriate setting. Then Lady is killed. Many people have already analysed the scene and why Sansa chose not to pick a side so I won\u2019t bother. The problem is that to many people this issue ends here and everything Sansa does afterwards is just Sansa being an asshole. It\u2019s clearly not. The Trident incident changed Sansa in many ways.</p><p>The change in Sansa\u2019s behaviour starts small:</p><blockquote><p>The kitchen yielded no lemon cakes, but they did find half of a cold strawberry pie, and that was almost as good. They ate it on the tower steps, giggling and gossiping and sharing secrets, and Sansa went to bed that night feeling almost as <b>wicked </b>as Arya.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Taking food from the kitchen likely without permission. There\u2019s also this:</p><blockquote><p>She turned to Septa Mordane, who was eating porridge with a wooden spoon. &ldquo;Septa, will Lord Beric spike Ser Gregor&rsquo;s head on his own gate or bring it back here for the king?&rdquo; She and Jeyne Poole had been arguing over that last night.</p><p>The septa was horror-struck. &ldquo;A lady does not discuss such things over her porridge. Where are your courtesies, Sansa? I swear, of late you&rsquo;ve been near as bad as your sister.&rdquo; <br/></p></blockquote><p>Discussing the many ways one can handle the body of a criminal is not standard Sansa behaviour at all. Can you imagine the Sansa we meet in Winterfell talking about this? I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not entirely possible, I\u2019m saying the violence she witnessed as well as Lady dying has given Sansa a cavalier look at death for a while. In fact the only time we see her being praised by the septa while in King\u2019s Landing is when she\u2019s stone faced watching someone die. Not only that, Sansa\u2019s constantly fighting with Arya. The impression we get of them in Winterfell is Arya being scolded for not acting like Sansa and Jeyne (and sometimes Sansa and Theon) called Arya \u2018Horseface\u2019 but most importantly that Arya ran off to play other children and Jon. The only time we see them together is during their lessons. After Lady dies, they argue a lot.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Liar,&rdquo; Arya said. Her hand clenched the blood orange so hard that red juice oozed between her fingers.</p><p>&ldquo;Go ahead, call me all the names you want,&rdquo; Sansa said airily. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t dare when I&rsquo;m married to Joffrey. You&rsquo;ll have to bow to me and call me Your Grace.&rdquo; <br/></p></blockquote><p>.<br/></p><blockquote><p>Finally she found her voice. &ldquo;What about my dress?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe \u2026 I could wash it,&rdquo; Arya said doubtfully.</p><p>&ldquo;Washing won&rsquo;t do any good,&rdquo; Sansa said. &ldquo;Not if you scrubbed all day and all night. The silk is ruined.&rdquo; <br/></p><p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll \u2026 make you a new one,&rdquo; Arya said.</p><p>Sansa threw back her head in disdain. &ldquo;You? You couldn&rsquo;t sew a dress fit to clean the pigsties.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>.</p><blockquote><p>Sansa&rsquo;s eyes had grown wide as the plates. &ldquo;A tourney,&rdquo; she breathed. She was seated between Septa Mordane and Jeyne Poole, as far from Arya as she could get without drawing a reproach from Father. <br/></p></blockquote><p>.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about their stupid tourney,&rdquo; Arya said. She knew Prince Joffrey would be there, and she hated Prince Joffrey.</p><p>Sansa lifted her head. &ldquo;It will be a splendid event. You shan&rsquo;t be wanted.&rdquo;</p><p>Anger flashed across Father&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Enough, Sansa. More of that and you will change my mind. I am weary unto death of this endless war you two are fighting. You are sisters. I expect you to behave like sisters, is that understood?&rdquo; <br/></p></blockquote><p>While the fighting between them is noticed, no one is really seeing the changes in Sansa\u2019s behaviour, her need to be grown up is more intense now, her showing up at places without permission (going to court while the Riverlands peasants talk about the horrible things they have suffered), etc. unless she\u2019s exploding in anger</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;You have juice on your face, Your Grace,&rdquo; Arya said.</p><p>It was running down her nose and stinging her eyes. Sansa wiped it away with a napkin. When she saw what the fruit in her lap had done to her beautiful ivory silk dress, she shrieked again. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re horrible,&rdquo; she screamed at her sister. &ldquo;They should have killed you instead of Lady!&rdquo;</p><p>Septa Mordane came lurching to her feet. &ldquo;Your lord father will hear of this! Go to your chambers, at once. At once!&rdquo; <br/></p></blockquote><p>.</p><blockquote><p>Sansa felt tears in her eyes. &ldquo;He is not! He&rsquo;s not the least bit like that old drunken king,&rdquo; she screamed at her sister, forgetting herself in her grief. <br/></p></blockquote><p>.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be so bad, Sansa,&rdquo; Arya said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to sail on a galley. It will be an adventure, and then we&rsquo;ll be with Bran and Robb again, and Old Nan and Hodor and the rest.&rdquo; She touched her on the arm.</p><p>&ldquo;Hodor!&rdquo; Sansa yelled. &ldquo;You ought to marry Hodor, you&rsquo;re just like him, stupid and hairy and ugly!&rdquo; She wrenched away from her sister&rsquo;s hand, stormed into her bedchamber, and barred the door behind her. </p></blockquote><p>Another element people rarely discuss (unless it\u2019s to pretend that\u2019s another sign of why Arya is better than her) is that Sansa felt jealous of Ned and Arya\u2019s relationship. It always seemed like Arya could no wrong and yet Sansa is the one being punished.</p><blockquote><p>None of which stopped Arya, of course. One day she came back grinning her horsey grin, her hair all tangled and her clothes covered in mud, clutching a raggedy bunch of purple and green flowers for Father. Sansa kept hoping he would tell Arya to behave herself and act like the highborn lady she was supposed to be, but he never did, he only hugged her and thanked her for the flowers. That just made her worse. <br/></p></blockquote><p>.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not supposed to leave the column,&rdquo; Sansa reminded her. &ldquo;Father said so.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya shrugged. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t go far. Anyway, Nymeria was with me the whole time. I don&rsquo;t always go off, either. Sometimes it&rsquo;s fun just to ride along with the wagons and talk to people.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p> Ned rarely interacted with Sansa during the first book unless he was telling her she couldn\u2019t go somewhere or scolding her in the aftermath of yet another fight or the \u2018trial\u2019 by the Trident or breaking her betrothal to Joffrey. Every interaction is either tense or it involves Sansa losing something important. In contrast Ned takes the time to explain things to Arya and takes into account her feelings and wishes. Ned gets Arya a dancing master and decides when they leave King\u2019s Landing to keep employing the man. Contrast this to Sansa\u2019s situation:</p><blockquote><p>Sansa cried as Septa Mordane marched them down the steps. They were going to take it all away; the tournaments and the court and her prince, everything, they were going to send her back to the bleak grey walls of Winterfell and lock her up forever. Her life was over before it had begun. <br/></p></blockquote><p>Sansa was really happy to leave the North and experience the rest of the world. Without explanation beyond Joffrey\u2019s personal failings that Ned didn\u2019t mention until this point. It would seem supremely unfair to Sansa and it wouldn\u2019t be the first time. When Robert asked for Lady to be killed and Ned did it, Sansa felt betrayed. After all Robert was Ned\u2019s friend, Ned could have fought against it especially since it was obvious to everyone what really happened but he didn\u2019t. There\u2019s no reference in either his chapters or Sansa\u2019s if they even interacted after that, if Ned comforted Sansa, if he told her where Lady\u2019s body was going. Nothing. This is why Sansa\u2019s relationship with Arya is so bad. \u00a0Sansa could not be angry at her father so she turn her anger towards Arya instead because it was easier. Until she started seeing Ned as the problem. </p><p>Sansa going to Cersei had little to do with Joffrey though Sansa was swept up by the romance she fabricated. For all that Sansa says she loves Joffrey, she doesn\u2019t think about him often and when she does there\u2019s this desperation to view him as someone from a story rather than a real person. It reads more like infatuation than any real affection. Sansa\u2019s anger and hurt at her father is more real and is the main motivation for her actions.</p><p>When she runs to Cersei, she tells herself it\u2019s for Joffrey because it\u2019s easier than admitting to herself that her father doesn\u2019t love or care about her as much as he does his other children, specifically Arya.</p>",

She does what is expected of her very well to the point that her parents rarely worry or wonder about her.

Then Lady is killed. Many people have already analysed the scene and why Sansa chose not to pick a side so I won\u2019t bother. The problem is that to many people this issue ends here and everything Sansa does afterwards is just Sansa being an asshole. It\u2019s clearly not. The Trident incident changed Sansa in many ways.</p><p>The change in Sansa\u2019s behaviour starts small:</p><blockquote><p>The kitchen yielded no lemon cakes, but they did find half of a cold strawberry pie, and that was almost as good.

Where are your courtesies, Sansa? I swear, of late you\u2019ve been near as bad as your sister.\u201d <br></p></blockquote><p>Discussing the many ways one can handle the body of a criminal is not standard Sansa behaviour at all. Can you imagine the Sansa we meet in Winterfell talking about this? I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not entirely possible, I\u2019m saying the violence she witnessed as well as Lady dying has given Sansa a cavalier look at death for a while. In fact the only time we see her being praised by the septa while in King\u2019s Landing is when she\u2019s stone faced watching someone die. Not only that, Sansa\u2019s constantly fighting with Arya. The impression we get of them in Winterfell is Arya being scolded for not acting like Sansa and Jeyne (and sometimes Sansa and Theon) called Arya \u2018Horseface\u2019 but most importantly that Arya ran off to play other children and Jon. The only time we see them together is during their lessons. After Lady dies, they argue a lot.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cLiar,\u201d Arya said. Her hand clenched the blood orange so hard that red juice oozed between her fingers.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, call me all the names you want,\u201d Sansa said airily. \u201cYou won\u2019t dare when I\u2019m married to Joffrey. You\u2019ll have to bow to me and call me Your Grace.\u201d <br></p></blockquote><p>.<br></p><blockquote><p>Finally she found her voice. \u201cWhat about my dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe \u2026 I could wash it,\u201d Arya said doubtfully.</p><p>\u201cWashing won\u2019t do any good,\u201d Sansa said. \u201cNot if you scrubbed all day and all night. The silk is ruined.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll \u2026 make you a new one,\u201d Arya said.</p><p>Sansa threw back her head in disdain. \u201cYou? You couldn\u2019t sew a dress fit to clean the pigsties.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>.</p><blockquote><p>Sansa\u2019s eyes had grown wide as the plates. \u201cA tourney,\u201d she breathed. She was seated between Septa Mordane and Jeyne Poole, as far from Arya as she could get without drawing a reproach from Father. <br></p></blockquote><p>.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about their stupid tourney,\u201d Arya said. She knew Prince Joffrey would be there, and she hated Prince Joffrey.</p><p>Sansa lifted her head. \u201cIt will be a splendid event. You shan\u2019t be wanted.\u201d</p><p>Anger flashed across Father\u2019s face. \u201cEnough, Sansa. More of that and you will change my mind. I am weary unto death of this endless war you two are fighting. You are sisters. I expect you to behave like sisters, is that understood?\u201d <br></p></blockquote><p>While the fighting between them is noticed, no one is really seeing the changes in Sansa\u2019s behaviour, her need to be grown up is more intense now, her showing up at places without permission (going to court while the Riverlands peasants talk about the horrible things they have suffered), etc. unless she\u2019s exploding in anger</p><blockquote><p>\u201cYou have juice on your face, Your Grace,\u201d Arya said.</p><p>It was running down her nose and stinging her eyes. Sansa wiped it away with a napkin. When she saw what the fruit in her lap had done to her beautiful ivory silk dress, she shrieked again. \u201cYou\u2019re horrible,\u201d she screamed at her sister. \u201cThey should have killed you instead of Lady!\u201d</p><p>Septa Mordane came lurching to her feet. \u201cYour lord father will hear of this! Go to your chambers, at once. At once!\u201d <br></p></blockquote><p>.</p><blockquote><p>Sansa felt tears in her eyes. \u201cHe is not! He\u2019s not the least bit like that old drunken king,\u201d she screamed at her sister, forgetting herself in her grief. <br></p></blockquote><p>.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be so bad, Sansa,\u201d Arya said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to sail on a galley. It will be an adventure, and then we\u2019ll be with Bran and Robb again, and Old Nan and Hodor and the rest.\u201d She touched her on the arm.</p><p>\u201cHodor!\u201d Sansa yelled. \u201cYou ought to marry Hodor, you\u2019re just like him, stupid and hairy and ugly!\u201d She wrenched away from her sister\u2019s hand, stormed into her bedchamber, and barred the door behind her. </p></blockquote><p>Another element people rarely discuss (unless it\u2019s to pretend that\u2019s another sign of why Arya is better than her) is that Sansa felt jealous of Ned and Arya\u2019s relationship. It always seemed like Arya could no wrong and yet Sansa is the one being punished.</p><blockquote><p>None of which stopped Arya, of course. One day she came back grinning her horsey grin, her hair all tangled and her clothes covered in mud, clutching a raggedy bunch of purple and green flowers for Father. Sansa kept hoping he would tell Arya to behave herself and act like the highborn lady she was supposed to be, but he never did, he only hugged her and thanked her for the flowers. That just made her worse. <br></p></blockquote><p>.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to leave the column,\u201d Sansa reminded her. \u201cFather said so.\u201d</p><p>Arya shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t go far. Anyway, Nymeria was with me the whole time. I don\u2019t always go off, either. Sometimes it\u2019s fun just to ride along with the wagons and talk to people.\u201d</p></blockquote><p> Ned rarely interacted with Sansa during the first book unless he was telling her she couldn\u2019t go somewhere or scolding her in the aftermath of yet another fight or the \u2018trial\u2019 by the Trident or breaking her betrothal to Joffrey. Every interaction is either tense or it involves Sansa losing something important. In contrast Ned takes the time to explain things to Arya and takes into account her feelings and wishes. Ned gets Arya a dancing master and decides when they leave King\u2019s Landing to keep employing the man. Contrast this to Sansa\u2019s situation:</p><blockquote><p>Sansa cried as Septa Mordane marched them down the steps. They were going to take it all away; the tournaments and the court and her prince, everything, they were going to send her back to the bleak grey walls of Winterfell and lock her up forever. Her life was over before it had begun. <br></p></blockquote><p>Sansa was really happy to leave the North and experience the rest of the world. Without explanation beyond Joffrey\u2019s personal failings that Ned didn\u2019t mention until this point. It would seem supremely unfair to Sansa and it wouldn\u2019t be the first time. When Robert asked for Lady to be killed and Ned did it, Sansa felt betrayed. After all Robert was Ned\u2019s friend, Ned could have fought against it especially since it was obvious to everyone what really happened but he didn\u2019t. There\u2019s no reference in either his chapters or Sansa\u2019s if they even interacted after that, if Ned comforted Sansa, if he told her where Lady\u2019s body was going. Nothing. This is why Sansa\u2019s relationship with Arya is so bad. \u00a0Sansa could not be angry at her father so she turn her anger towards Arya instead because it was easier. Until she started seeing Ned as the problem. </p><p>Sansa going to Cersei had little to do with Joffrey though Sansa was swept up by the romance she fabricated. For all that Sansa says she loves Joffrey, she doesn\u2019t think about him often and when she does there\u2019s this desperation to view him as someone from a story rather than a real person. It reads more like infatuation than any real affection. Sansa\u2019s anger and hurt at her father is more real and is the main motivation for her actions.</p><p>When she runs to Cersei, she tells herself it\u2019s for Joffrey because it\u2019s easier than admitting to herself that her father doesn\u2019t love or care about her as much as he does his other children, specifically Arya.</p>",
