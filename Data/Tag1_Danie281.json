It likely wouldn\u2019t make a difference, but if she kept her stance throughout the trial, the judge may bring it into consideration.</p><p><b><i>\u201cI\u2019ve been told you were the person to free Mr Howell from his second kidnapping.

It would surely help Phil, and she wouldn\u2019t be lying which she\u2019d promised herself she wouldn\u2019t do.</p><p><b><i>\u201cDan had missed his appointment. Since I didn\u2019t have any sessions for the rest of the day, I decided to go check up on them to make sure they were okay. When I got there, I heard shouting and two distinct voices that I knew weren\u2019t Dan and Phil\u2019s. My gut was telling me to call the police, so I did and when they arrived, they barged in. Mr. Kide had held them both hostage within their flat. From what I\u2019ve heard from Phil, and what I\u2019ve learnt with Dan, both were equally abused sexually. Dan was, unfortunately, more at harm, however. Phil has recounted to me cutting words into Dan\u2019s stomach completely against his will. In his words, minus the swearing, \u2018I couldn\u2019t control my body, whatever drug he injected shouldn\u2019t exist\u2019. Your honor, would you like to see a copy of my notes?\u201d </i></b>The judge nodded, and someone dressed in a suit stepped forward to take them from her, delivering them to the judge.</p><p><b><i>\u201cNo more questions for the witness at this time.\u201d</i></b> Mrs Raines said, taking a seat and quickly scribbling words onto her notepad.</p><p><i><b>\u201cMr Daul, any questions for the witness?\u201d </b></i>The man stood, straightening his pages against his desk as he cleared his throat.</p><p><b><i>\u201cMiss Miller, do you have any evidence that Mr Lester wasn\u2019t in control during the second abduction?\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cWell, uh, no, but I did bring the medical records from the hospital after they were rescued,</i></b>\u201d she said, quickly shuffling through her papers before handing it over the same man who\u2019d collected her notes.</p><p>\u201c<b><i>Uh huh, and do you have any evidence that suggests Mr Lester wasn\u2019t contributing to Mr Howell\u2019s harm?\u201d</i></b></p><p><i><b>\u201cWell, he was,\u201d</b></i> she explained. <i><b>\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t consensual, just like a lot of the stuff that happened,\u201d</b></i> she said, mumbling the second half.</p><p><b><i>\u201cUh huh, and can you prove Mr Lester didn\u2019t make Kide hurt him simply to keep the police off his trail? From the medical records, Mr Lester\u2019s injuries were considerably less than Mr Howell\u2019s.\u201d</i></b></p><p>\u201c<b><i>Well, that is true. And I can\u2019t prove that it wasn\u2019t because of what you say, but during the first kidnapping, Phil was incredibly concerned. One of his and Dan\u2019s friends, Louise Pentland, is here today in court. She can recall more of Phil\u2019s reaction to when Dan was captured. I wasn\u2019t there at the time.\u201d</i></b></p><p><i><b>\u201cOkay, and one last question. From what I\u2019ve heard, you were the one to contact the police in regards to Lester in the first place. Can you please explain what made you choose to do that?\u201d</b></i></p><p><b><i>\u201cPhil was visiting the hospital I work at where Dan was staying at the time and is still staying. From what I could tell of the situation, Phil had to leave and had told me that Dan needed to be looked after. I can\u2019t remember how, but he referred to Dan as a \u2018good boy\u2019 which must have triggered something within Dan as he grabbed the scissors from my desk and began begging for Phil to hurt him. While I don\u2019t believe Phil had intentionally hurt him, I had to report it. The policy of my work dictates that if I believe anyone staying may be in danger, I have to report it to the police and hospital board. I didn\u2019t want to, nor do I believe Dan was thinking clearly at the time, but I had to contact the police.\u201d</i></b></p><p>Mr Daul nodded. <i><b>\u201cNo more questions for the witness.\u201d</b></i></p>",

Dan was, unfortunately, more at harm, however. Phil has recounted to me cutting words into Dan&rsquo;s stomach completely against his will. In his words, minus the swearing, &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t control my body, whatever drug he injected shouldn&rsquo;t exist&rsquo;. Your honor, would you like to see a copy of my notes?&rdquo; </i></b>The judge nodded, and someone dressed in a suit stepped forward to take them from her, delivering them to the judge.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;No more questions for the witness at this time.&rdquo;</i></b> Mrs Raines said, taking a seat and quickly scribbling words onto her notepad.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Mr Daul, any questions for the witness?&rdquo; </b></i>The man stood, straightening his pages against his desk as he cleared his throat.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Miss Miller, do you have any evidence that Mr Lester wasn&rsquo;t in control during the second abduction?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Well, uh, no, but I did bring the medical records from the hospital after they were rescued,</i></b>&rdquo; she said, quickly shuffling through her papers before handing it over the same man who&rsquo;d collected her notes.</p><p>&ldquo;<b><i>Uh huh, and do you have any evidence that suggests Mr Lester wasn&rsquo;t contributing to Mr Howell&rsquo;s harm?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Well, he was,&rdquo;</b></i> she explained. <i><b>&ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t consensual, just like a lot of the stuff that happened,&rdquo;</b></i> she said, mumbling the second half.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Uh huh, and can you prove Mr Lester didn&rsquo;t make Kide hurt him simply to keep the police off his trail? From the medical records, Mr Lester&rsquo;s injuries were considerably less than Mr Howell&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>&ldquo;<b><i>Well, that is true. And I can&rsquo;t prove that it wasn&rsquo;t because of what you say, but during the first kidnapping, Phil was incredibly concerned. One of his and Dan&rsquo;s friends, Louise Pentland, is here today in court. She can recall more of Phil&rsquo;s reaction to when Dan was captured. I wasn&rsquo;t there at the time.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Okay, and one last question. From what I&rsquo;ve heard, you were the one to contact the police in regards to Lester in the first place. Can you please explain what made you choose to do that?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Phil was visiting the hospital I work at where Dan was staying at the time and is still staying. From what I could tell of the situation, Phil had to leave and had told me that Dan needed to be looked after. I can&rsquo;t remember how, but he referred to Dan as a &lsquo;good boy&rsquo; which must have triggered something within Dan as he grabbed the scissors from my desk and began begging for Phil to hurt him. While I don&rsquo;t believe Phil had intentionally hurt him, I had to report it. The policy of my work dictates that if I believe anyone staying may be in danger, I have to report it to the police and hospital board. I didn&rsquo;t want to, nor do I believe Dan was thinking clearly at the time, but I had to contact the police.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>Mr Daul nodded. <i><b>&ldquo;No more questions for the witness.&rdquo;</b></i></p>",
