adam says to you and waves goodbye</li><li>you and adam where gonna go eat at subway or some other fast food place tomorrow cause why not????</li><li>it was his idea and you definitely didnt mind making new friends, and he was sweet and cute too but not your type but definitely your friend type!</li><li>anyways, you smile at him and try and get one of your hands free to wave at him back</li><li>your hand suddenly comes to a rest when you see him walk towards the mystery man you were lowkey just checking out</li><li>you see them do some hand shake hug and then you see adam nod aggressively, the other man laughing</li><li>the dark clothed man hops onto his motorcycle and suddenly he&rsquo;s gone</li><li>you&rsquo;d never thought adam to have such&hellip;&hellip;.badass friends</li><li>anyways</li><li>you go home, or well your dorm that you share with your roommate helene</li><li>helene was a foreign exchange student that you had quickly grown close with after a few weeks of knowing her, and you both had roommates you weren&rsquo;t clicking with so you both decided to just move in together</li><li>&ldquo;hey!&rdquo; you hear her say</li><li>&ldquo;hellooooo&rdquo; you say dragging the o&rsquo;s out while taking of your shoes</li><li>&ldquo;off to photography class?&rdquo; you ask her, knowing she was interested in photography and that was what she did majority of her free time</li><li>&ldquo;you bet! i&rsquo;ll be home later then usual tonight so don&rsquo;t wait up for me and you can lock the door&rdquo; she says</li><li>you knew she was kinda popular, at least with the foreign exchange students group (that you didnt even know existed) and was probably gonna do something with them</li><li>you nod to what she says and wish her luck</li><li>a few movies and a few thoughts about the hot mystery man you saw today later you hear your phone ring</li><li>you grin comes across your face when you see adam&rsquo;s contact number</li><li>hinking that he was gonna ask you to pick him up again cause he&rsquo;s drunk and needed to crash somewhere somehow</li><li>&ldquo;heyoooo y/n, hope your not doing anything that makes me a bother. but, about tomorrow&hellip;&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;mmm?&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;well im gonna get a small tattoo tomorrow and my dumbass had booked it at the same time we where suppose to eat or hang out or whatever so i was wondering if we could pick up the food and then maybeeeee we could eat and hang out at the tattoo place?&rdquo;</li><li>you&rsquo;d never think adam of a tattoo kinda man actually</li><li>&ldquo;yeah yeah, but just come by my dorm whenever and we&rsquo;ll leave and you&rsquo;ll guide the way? how about that?&rdquo;</li><li>he said a few other things, like when he was gonna come by and pick you up and then you hang up.</li><li>during the night you hear helene come in and go to bed</li><li>anyways, you wake up, do your daily routine, yada yada yada !</li><li>say goodbye and goodmorning to helene</li><li>12pm adam picks you up almost on the dot</li><li>&ldquo;so what&rsquo;s the plan mister?&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll we&rsquo;re kinda already late too my appointment so i just post mated your favorite food to the tattoo place, its cool though. the harry and i are tight&rdquo;</li><li>whos harry, you wonder to yourself</li><li>&ldquo;if you say so, and you&rsquo;re sure he won&rsquo;t mind me being there?&rdquo; you say</li><li>&ldquo;definitely not, besides i need someone to hold my hand and wont embarrass me about it later&hellip;&hellip;.i also bought him food&rdquo; adam says shaking his head</li><li>&ldquo;alrighty&rdquo;</li><li>you two walk out of the building and hop into his car, him driving the way too the tattoo place</li><li>&ldquo;soooooo, what are you gonna get?&rdquo; you ask</li><li>&ldquo;you&rsquo;re just gonna have to wait and see&rdquo; he says with a smile</li><li>about ten minutes later, you arrive to a small but cute tattoo shop, with a little cafe next to it which makes it very convenient</li><li>you hear the bell ping when adam open&rsquo;s the door for you</li><li>the shop is nicely done, a few drawings wherever but clean and nice nonetheless</li><li>the smell off cologne reeks in the shop though</li><li>you turn to your left and see a older man, siting and waiting what looks like to get another tattoo on his already half tattooed arm</li><li>you smile at him and he returns the favor</li><li>your mama/papa/guardian raised you to be kind! even too strangers! especially too strangers!</li><li>after your eyes finish looking around your gaze goes back to adam</li><li>you dont find him at your side which kinda freaks you out</li><li>but then you look up, straight, and seeing him talk to someone</li><li>someone you cant see cause adam&rsquo;s big figure covers the mystery person</li><li>you go over to adam cause you wanna be with your friend</li><li>especially in places you&rsquo;ve never been before</li><li>oh</li><li>you see adam talking his mouth off and you see the hot mystery man from yesterday leaning against the payment table just nodding his head</li><li>you&rsquo;re mind quickly panics !!! cause !!! wtf !!!</li><li>honestly you cant really figure out why you&rsquo;re panicking the way you are because hes just a normal person&hellip;&hellip;that just so happens to look like a child from a greek god and an angel</li><li>you go over to adam&rsquo;s side looking at your sneakers, kinda feeling clingy but whatever</li><li>you definitely feel a hard gaze on you from the man&rsquo;s eyes</li><li>adam&rsquo;s talking comes to an halt when he feels your presence, also your shoulder brushing against him</li><li>&ldquo;see anything you might want? maybe you should get a tattoo too y/n&rdquo; adam says winking at you</li><li>&ldquo;uhhhh definitely not&rdquo; you say, sure you&rsquo;d thought about tattoos but it wasn&rsquo;t a priority right now</li><li>&ldquo;boring anyways harry&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo; adam says and keeps on talking about his tattoo</li><li>oh, so the tattoo artist&rsquo;s name was harry, should&rsquo;ve figured out that earlier</li><li>guess no more calling him hot mystery man</li><li>still having his gaze on yours</li><li>&ldquo;so, who&rsquo;s this? got a new girlfriend, lad?&rdquo; the tattoo artist asks</li><li>and oh god</li><li>his voice</li><li>and he&rsquo;s british</li><li>almost makes you fall on your knees</li><li>&ldquo;y/n? nooo. still with emi, you know that!&rdquo; adam says and pats on his shoulder</li><li>you see harry nod</li><li>him being glad that you&rsquo;re not with adam so he would feel guilty about checking you out, he thinks</li><li>feels weird to call him harry you think</li><li>you see harry walks and wave his hand for you two too go where he goes</li><li>you end up on a cute little tattoo station, you&rsquo;d say and call it at least. it&rsquo;s probably wrong in the tattoo book</li><li>you grin when seeing the lollipops on the side of it, desperately wanting to take one but not knowing if you&rsquo;re allowed to</li><li>you&rsquo;re just so hungry and adam had promised you food, which isnt here</li><li>harry notices your look of desire and takes up the bowl of lollipops, still with your eyes on them, asking adam if he wanted one, adam saying no, and asking you if you&rsquo;d like one</li><li>you nod and smile and take a lollipop of your desire</li><li>you talk to adam some, calming his nerves about getting a tattoo</li><li>&ldquo;adam what are you even gonna get?&rdquo; you ask realizing you dont even know what hes getting, cause you zoned out when he talked about it</li><li>&ldquo;ohhhh, today a bass guitar on my leg. go big or go home!&rdquo; adam says laughing</li><li>you smile, knowing how much he loves music and bass guitars</li><li>&ldquo;that&rsquo;s cute&rdquo; you say and go back to calming his nerves</li><li>harry, quietly says too himself a &ldquo;you&rsquo;re cute&rdquo;</li><li>he wonders what the hell is going trough him cause you are an absolute stranger, that he&rsquo;s never met before but god, after he saw you outside yesterday did he not stop thinking about the angel like person</li><li>the amount of joy that went though him when he saw you walking into his tattoo shop was shameful, he thought at least</li><li>he thinks it&rsquo;s lame that he&rsquo;s feeling like this</li><li>anyways, you open your lollipop before going to hold adam&rsquo;s hand, cause harry was done preparing everything and was ready to get started</li><li>but wow, it was hard for harry to focus correctly seeing that lollipop in your mouth, very much wishing it was something\u00a8</li><li>he curses at himself for thinking those things</li><li>during the tattoo, harry and adam talk some and you butt in whenever</li><li>however, even with how much you love your friend adam, you really wished he would shut up so you could listen to that amazing voice of harry&rsquo;s talk</li><li>cause, jeez, was it attractive and hot</li><li>a few lollipops and dark plumped lips later, a girl comes to the station with a bag off food</li><li>finally!! you think and accidentally end up saying out loud</li><li>both adam and harry laugh</li><li>aND his laugh!!!! the most amazing sound in the world you think</li><li>however, the man holding the tattoo gun across the room thinks differently</li><li>the times you let out a laugh or giggle he could just feel himself warming up with happiness</li><li>the thought if it being the most amazing sound in the world crosses his mind a LOT</li><li>you sigh of relief when you see the food that you absolutely adore, glad that adam knows you that well to order it</li><li>still holding adam&rsquo;s hand, you open both yours and adam&rsquo;s food, also taking harry&rsquo;s out, and begin to eat!</li><li>a few conversations later, the tattoo is done</li><li>you sigh knowing that you&rsquo;re probably never gonna see this gorgeous man ever again and tried to remember all the special details that made him him</li><li>&ldquo;see you next week harry!&rdquo; adam says</li><li>&ldquo;next week?&rdquo; you ask</li><li>&ldquo;yea, gonna get another one next week&rdquo; adam says like it&rsquo;s obvious</li><li>&ldquo;wanna go with me? you made me feel better today so&hellip;.i know emi would just laugh at my cries&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;yeah sure, dont have anything better to do&rdquo; you say grabbing another lollipop for the ride home</li><li>you and adam leave then, the man in the waiting room still there</li><li>and, harry knew damn well he was gonna buy a lot more lollipops next week.</li><li>a week paces and its saturday again</li><li>a lot of hanging out with adam and some of his friends</li><li>and going on many movie marathons with helene</li><li>feeling like deja vu, considering you were just in this car going to the tattoo place last week</li><li>harry had promised himself that he was gonna try and talk to you this time around, try and get to know you, he also could do this considering adam probably wouldnt be talking that much this time cause he&rsquo;s getting a tattoo on his ribs</li><li>he sees you and adam walk though the door, laughing\u00a0</li><li>god he wished he would be the one that could make you laugh like that</li><li>he thinks this whole crush thing has gotten too far, he knows / doubt you feel the same thing about him as he feels for you</li><li>he really isn&rsquo;t used to this</li><li>he always thought those romantic movies he saw with his sister and mother were lame and a never gonna happen thing</li><li>anyways, you smile at him and he smiles back which makes both of your tummy&rsquo;s bubble\u00a0</li><li>same station, same people but adam&rsquo;s in a different position, and \u00a0of course a lollipop in your mouth that harry tried his hardest not to focus on\u00a0</li><li>you where on harry&rsquo;s side this time, not across him</li><li>you could smell the scent of him which once again, made you weak to your knees\u00a0</li><li>and he could smell you, he tried not to let the scent of you and your closeness to him bother him that much, cause this is his job that he needs to focus on right now</li><li>also your question if he had tattoos on his neck was a no, no tattoo and just begging to be marked</li><li>&ldquo;ever thought bout gettin a tattoo, doll?&rdquo; harry asks you, but still his eyes focusing on adam&rsquo;s ribs and his tattoo</li><li>&ldquo;mhmm, a little. wanna get one someday definitely but haven&rsquo;t figured out what or where yet though. but if i ever get one, you&rsquo;re the man too go to it seems like&rdquo; you say, kinda regretting the last part but you blame your nerves\u00a0</li><li>harry laughs at that and nods\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;what about you? like, what&rsquo;s your favorite tattoo?&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;too many too choose from. maybe one day you can help me find my favorite, doll&rdquo; he says with a smirk playing on his lips</li><li>you definitely blushed at that and winced at the pain in your hand, being caused by adam</li><li>after that, the conversation just keeps on going</li><li>smaller questions leading to bigger answers</li><li>and more flirting on harry&rsquo;s part</li><li>and a lot of lollipops of on your part</li><li>adam lowkey had a smile on his face, knowing that harry wasnt the talkative type but kept answering your questions which adam knew harry probably would&rsquo;ve considered dumb if they came from anyone else&rsquo;s mouth\u00a0</li><li>sadly but quickly the tattoo was done, meaning you and harry had to go two different ways again</li><li>while adam&rsquo;s looking in the mirror, admiring the new art on his body</li><li>you and harry are talking, just about tattoos or whatever</li><li>suddenly an idea comes into adam&rsquo;s head</li><li>&ldquo;hey y/n, didn&rsquo;t you need to get help to draw that perspective room drawing? harry, dude, why don&rsquo;t you helpt y/n out?&rdquo; adam asks, fully knowing that you were struggling and even though you didn&rsquo;t need to pass this class, you wanted to anyways</li><li>harry looks at you, honestly waiting for you too just say anything\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;i mean, uh, i dont know, if you have time and would want too i&rsquo;d appreciate it&rdquo; you say, really not knowing what his reaction to this was\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;yeah, if it&rsquo;d help you and you want do, lets do it&rdquo; harry says, definitely not knowing where this nervousness is coming from</li><li>lowkey / HIGHKEY very happy about this arrangement\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;alright!! when are you available? it&rsquo;s suppose to be done before the 3rd, so preferably sometime before that&hellip;.&rdquo; you say smiling, noticing a smile on harry too</li><li>&ldquo;well, im available tomorrow night, if you&rsquo;d like we can do it tomorrow&rdquo; harry said\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;yeah! what time?&quot;\u00a0</li><li>&quot;well i have a tattoo appointment at five so i should be done at six so, how about six thirty?&rdquo; harry asks with a smirk\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;sure, see you then&rdquo; you say and grab adam&rsquo;s car keys and start heading out</li><li>the next day for you felt like forever</li><li>helene had a late morning which made you have a later morning\u00a0</li><li>classes weren&rsquo;t too entertaining\u00a0</li><li>a lot of thought about harry crossed your mind, too many times</li><li>about the time you got home you honestly just wanted to sleep</li><li>then you remembered you were seeing harry tonight\u00a0</li><li>and sure enough a smile and excitement hit you</li><li>you began to back your stuff, considering it was five fifteen and you where planning on walking\u00a0</li><li>you ate a little snack before heading off\u00a0</li><li>a few moments later you began your walk to the shop, coming a little late with a small mishap with that a kid needed to find their legal guardian</li><li>when you showed up, you saw harry alone cleaning up a station, assuming it was where he was tattooing\u00a0</li><li>his head lifts when he hears the bell ping from the door</li><li>&ldquo;hi&rdquo; you say softly</li><li>&ldquo;hello, doll face&rdquo; his velvety voice echoed\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;how&rsquo;d the tattoo go?&rdquo; you ask, the question came naturally really\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;alright, guy was kinda a dick but what to do. most people are when being tattooed&rdquo; harry said and ended it with a smiler</li><li>he walked towards a door, waiting for you too be right behind him</li><li>you got the hint and quickly went over to him which made him laugh which then made you embarrassed\u00a0</li><li>he opened the door to a somewhat large room with a few unopened cardboard boxes, a few desks and just tattoo material a little everywhere</li><li>he pulled out two chairs to a desk, his desk assuming\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;well? you gonna show me what we&rsquo;re working on or are we just gonna wing it?&quot;\u00a0</li><li>&quot;oh yeah&rdquo; you say, bringing your laptop and a paper out, seeing that harry had already pulled out erasers and a pen</li><li>you showed him your assignment and what you had started with\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;so, im kinda going for a museum vibe, if that makes sense. i saw a picture online where it was a museum in point perspective and i thought it looked cool and like something that i can actually do&rdquo; you say, hoping he&rsquo;s getting where you&rsquo;re going with your blabbering\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;o'kay, it looks good so far&rdquo; he says looking down at your paper</li><li>&ldquo;so what seems to be the problem if i may ask, princess?&rdquo; he says looking up at you</li><li>right into your eyes</li><li>god, those green eyes\u00a0</li><li>you could stare into them forever without a complaint leaving your mouth\u00a0</li><li>harry could say the same for you, but his eyes leaving yours and looking at your lips</li><li>what he would do to get a taste</li><li>hes not proud of it but he did think how her lips would taste right after she had eaten one of those damn lollipops\u00a0</li><li>and what that nickname did too you was</li><li>&hellip;&hellip;.not holy</li><li>&ldquo;well i cant seem to get the art, that&rsquo;s suppose to represent paintings on the picture, all in a straight line to match the dot&rdquo; you say, trying your best to explain it</li><li>&ldquo;right, okay. it&rsquo;s gonna be a struggle considering i wanna teach you how to do it but also do it in a straight line when&hellip;..when you know&hellip;.where two people needing to see and do a one person thing&rdquo; harry said, very much hoping you got what he meant</li><li>you didnt</li><li>you scooted closer to harry\u00a0</li><li>making your shoulders and knees to touch\u00a0</li><li>harry smiled\u00a0</li><li>and grabbed a ruler to put in the middle and then draw a straight line</li><li>you sigh, not really understanding or seeing with his large hand and bicep blocking the view</li><li>&ldquo;you kno what?&rdquo; harry says</li><li>you look at him with confusing all over your face</li><li>suddenly you feel two very large hands on your thigh moving you</li><li>making you sit on harry&rsquo;s lap</li><li>you didnt mind</li><li>you definitely didnt mind</li><li>neither did he</li><li>but you cheeks couldn&rsquo;t help themselves to blush a very very very dark red</li><li>&ldquo;good?&rdquo; he asks\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;very&rdquo; you says quietly, really hoping he doesnt hear it</li><li>you sitting on his lap was very much a in the moment move for harry\u00a0</li><li>but god</li><li>did he love it</li><li>he also smirked at hearing you say very and smirked at the dark shade of red your cheeks were</li><li>&ldquo;alright so&hellip;..&rdquo; he says grabbing the ruler and keeps on explaining what to do and what not to do</li><li>it kinda ended you him doing your work for you while you&rsquo;re sitting in his lap, arm and hand behind his neck, softly playing with the small curls hoping he doesnt mind</li><li>he really doesnt mind this\u00a0</li><li>the feeling of your hands on the back of his neck playing with his hair makes him happy and soothes him</li><li>you really cant help but feel like this is inappropriate\u00a0</li><li>you dont even know if he&rsquo;s single</li><li>sure, yesterday you got to learn a lot about him but nothing about his love life</li><li>all these thoughts going through your head made you tired\u00a0</li><li>a yawn leaving your mouth indicating how tired you really were</li><li>&ldquo;tired, hmm?&rdquo; harry asks, knowing the obvious answer\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;no, promise&rdquo; you say, obviously lying\u00a0</li><li>he grins and grabs the lollipops across the desk and gives you it</li><li>thinking it might wake you up a little</li><li>&ldquo;thank you&rdquo; you say, opening it\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;don&rsquo;t mention it, pretty&rdquo; he says, feeling happy that your happy\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;you&rsquo;re pretty&rdquo; you say quietly too yourself</li><li>harry smiles at that</li><li>the lollipop woke you up, turns out you just needed a little sugar in you</li><li>quickly you were back to commenting and asking on what he was doing and meaning</li><li>&ldquo;all done!&rdquo; harry says</li><li>&ldquo;wow&hellip;&hellip;thank you for doing my assignment for me. i feel a lot better about this now. now im also done a week before it&rsquo;s suppose to be done!&rdquo; you say happily\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;mmmm. glad i could help, doll&rdquo; harry says, feeling very happy and a warm feeling in his body</li><li>he turns his head, looking at you</li><li>you were already looking at him</li><li>you smile at this</li><li>he brushes a strand of your hair behind your ear with a dopey smile on his face</li><li>you giggled at the sudden affection\u00a0</li><li>or what you counted as affection\u00a0</li><li>he really wanted to hear that sound again</li><li>his hand not leaving you face and end up cupping your cheek\u00a0</li><li>the desire of touching and kissing your lips is driving him absolutely wild</li><li>his thumb caresses your cheek</li><li>&ldquo;uh&rdquo; you grunt\u00a0</li><li>he smiles\u00a0</li><li>he moves your legs</li><li>puts his hands on your hips, making you end up straddling him\u00a0</li><li>he leans back in his chair, enjoying the moment</li><li>her hands still playing with his hair, enjoying the feeling of his hair in your fingers</li><li>he really wants to kiss you</li><li>you really want to kiss him</li><li>&ldquo;can i kiss you?&rdquo; harry asks softly for once, really not wanting to somehow scare you off</li><li>&ldquo;yeah&rdquo; you nod, really not wanting to show how desperate you really are</li><li>his soft lips softly brushing against yours, just a touch</li><li>his hands grabbing your hips, the tips of his fingers ending up on your ass, digging a little making you softly moan\u00a0</li><li>this gives him a chance to slide his tongue into yours</li><li>your hands meeting behind his neck, both ending up in his hair, pulling lightly\u00a0</li><li>you break away from the kiss\u00a0</li><li>taking in a gulp of fresh air</li><li>a pout forms on his lips</li><li>lips still chasing yours when you pull away</li><li>so to entertain himself</li><li>he starts kissing down your neck\u00a0</li><li>starts sucking on you, making his own art on you</li><li>one of his hands lowering to fully squeeze your ass\u00a0</li><li>making you moan once again</li><li>&ldquo;mmmmm&rdquo; he says and laughs softly\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;thank you&rdquo; you say\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;hmm? for what, lovie?&rdquo; he asks curiously\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;for asking for permission&rdquo; you say with a big smile on your face</li><li>&ldquo;of course, baby&rdquo; he says giving your lips another peck and starts going to town on your neck once again</li><li>&ldquo;been drivin&rsquo; me crazy&rdquo; harry says with a light smile\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;really?&rdquo; you ask</li><li>surely he couldn&rsquo;t have been thinking about you as much as you had been thinking about him</li><li>&ldquo;yes, been drivin&rsquo; me crazy by me thinking bout you ever since i first saw you when you walked outta that class&rdquo; harry says while looking up at you again, giving your ass another light squeeze making you smile\u00a0</li><li>he presses a kiss on your forehead, with your hands still playing on his curls on his pretty head\u00a0</li><li>anyways, time passes a bit and you two just enjoy each others presence</li><li>&ldquo;whats the time?&rdquo; you ask</li><li>he looks up at the clock</li><li>&ldquo;9:45pm&quot;\u00a0</li><li>&quot;what? no way, ive been here that long&quot;\u00a0</li><li>&quot;seems like it&rdquo; he says with a smirk arriving on his face again\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;how are your legs not numb?&rdquo; you ask, cause you&rsquo;ve been in his lap for hours</li><li>&ldquo;never skip leg day, doll face&rdquo; he says with a playing smile</li><li>&ldquo;where ya going, love?&rdquo; he asks when you suddenly pull away from his grip\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;class early in the morning, can&rsquo;t be here all night, sadly enough&rdquo; you say, this time your the once with the pout\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;how are you gettin&rsquo; home?&rdquo; he asks, obviously wanting an safe answer\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;uhhh walking? thats how i got here&rdquo; you say honestly while packing up your stuff in your bag and putting on your jacket\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;nope. let me give you a ride, baby&rdquo; he says hopeful</li><li>&ldquo;sure, gladly&rdquo; you say giving him a sign that you&rsquo;re ready to leave</li><li>he nods and gets a pair of keys in the drawer and a helmet on the chair thats across the room</li><li>he also grabs his leather jacket on the same chair</li><li>of course he&rsquo;d have a leather jacket</li><li>&ldquo;cmon&rdquo; he says</li><li>you two walk through the store and end up in the back outside\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;nope. no way im riding on that&rdquo; you say, obviously scared of the thing before you</li><li>a motorcycle</li><li>&ldquo;its just a bike, princess. nothing to be afraid off, you&rsquo;ll hold onto me&rdquo; harry says comforting</li><li>&ldquo;harry&hellip;..i dont know&rdquo; you say questioning the situation\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;promise you. know we haven&rsquo;t known each other that long but i&rsquo;ve had my tongue in your mouth now, think you can trust me&rdquo; harry says\u00a0\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;alright. i guess&rdquo; you say\u00a0</li><li>harry hands you a helmet to wear, he watched you put on the helmet just too see what you where doing it right\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;where&rsquo;s your helmet&quot;\u00a0</li><li>&quot;dont have one&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;oh&rdquo;</li><li>he quickly hops on, waiting for you to hop on too behind him</li><li>you put your arms around his torso, feeling the rock hard abs underneath his t-shirt\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;ready?&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;born ready, i suppose&rdquo; you feel his laugh starting in his torso and coming out of his mouth</li><li>a few weeks later</li><li>&ldquo;hey lovie&rdquo; you hear him say and you feel a kiss being placed on the back of your head</li><li>&ldquo;hi&rdquo; you say turning around putting your arms around his neck kissing his lips ever so slightly\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; he asks, kissing your forehead ever so lightly\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;nothing really, got class in a few minutes. what are you doing here? adam&rsquo;s gonna be here any minute now&rdquo; you say, also very curious what he&rsquo;s doing outside your art class, something out of the ordinary\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;had a very important question that i just couldn&rsquo;t wait to ask, baby&rdquo; he says with a cheeky smile\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;hmmm? well what is it?&rdquo; you say even more curious looking deeply and lovingly into his deep green eyes and his into yours\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;well, it popped into my mind that i had never fully asked you too be my girlfriend&rdquo; he said with a playful grin</li><li>he&rsquo;s been wanting to ask you out ever since that night at the parlor but had been too afraid to ask, he didn&rsquo;t really want to know your answer, even if it was a yes</li><li>&ldquo;oh yeah?&quot;\u00a0</li><li>&quot;mmm sooo, will you be my girlfriend, baby?&rdquo; harry asks ever so sweetly\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;even though ive already considered us boyfriend and girlfriend, yes i will&rdquo; you laugh while he pulls you in for a kiss</li><li>you see him basically every day after that\u00a0</li><li>but you haven&rsquo;t told anyone\u00a0</li><li>it&rsquo;s not like you where trying to keep it a secret, it just so happened to end up being a secret\u00a0</li><li>you knew it was gonna be revealed anytime now considering adam was gonna get his bass guitar tattoo fully finished and some details checked, also his rib tattoo had been itching a little that he wanted to get checked\u00a0</li><li>you knew harry couldn&rsquo;t keep his hands to himself and neither could you, you either always having too be in his lap, your hands always touching his, his hand always being on your thigh, and so much more</li><li>PDA is a common thing basically\u00a0</li><li>also helene had been wondering where you where going all the time</li><li>and once</li><li>his sister and mom had facetimed him</li><li>right when you where on his lap, kissing him with passion</li><li>leaving him with very pink and plumped lips</li><li>which of course his mom just NEEDED to know what happened</li><li>you tried your hardest not to make a sound or whimper, even with the aching feeling between your thighs just begging to be touched by the man talking about his sister\u2019s new boyfriend\u2019s pool party</li><li>&ldquo;heyyyy y/n, you coming with me tomorrow for the tattoo check ups? it&rsquo;d be weird if you didn&rsquo;t considering you&rsquo;ve been there everytime and its kinda like a thing now, alright that doesn&rsquo;t make sense but pleaseeeeee come with?&rdquo; adam rambles on</li><li>&ldquo;adam adam adam calm down. yes yes, i&rsquo;d love too! come to my dorm when we leave?&rdquo; you ask already knowing the answer\u00a0</li><li>&ldquo;you bet!&rdquo; he says and hugs you and runs off to wherever making you giggle\u00a0</li><li>saturday around noon you find yourself where you&rsquo;ve been the past weeks, at the tattoo parlor</li><li>the bell pings when adam and you walk in making harry look up at his now girlfriend and friend</li><li>&ldquo;hey harold, ready for my check ups and what not?&rdquo; adam says clapping his hands as a sign ready to get it over and doing the handshake hug with harry\u00a0</li><li>you watch as harry nods\u00a0</li><li>you suddenly feel a hand on your back grabbing you so that you&rsquo;re chest to chest with harry</li><li>&ldquo;and hello too you, baby&rdquo;

adam says really not knowing what to do at the moment\u00a0</li><li>you giggle at adam and feel harry giving you a kiss on the forehead and pulling away to get the tattoo and cream ready</li><li>&ldquo;a little while, i guess&rdquo;

small but cute tattoo shop, with a little cafe next to it which makes it very convenient</li><li>you hear the bell ping when adam open\u2019s the door for you</li><li>the shop is nicely done, a few drawings wherever but clean and nice nonetheless</li><li>the smell off cologne reeks in the shop though</li><li>you turn to your left and see a older man, siting and waiting what looks like to get another tattoo on his already half tattooed arm</li><li>you smile at him and he returns the favor</li><li>your mama/papa/guardian raised you to be kind! even too strangers! especially too strangers!</li><li>after your eyes finish looking around your gaze goes back to adam</li><li>you dont find him at your side which kinda freaks you out</li><li>but then you look up, straight, and seeing him talk to someone</li><li>someone you cant see cause adam\u2019s big figure covers the mystery person</li><li>you go over to adam cause you wanna be with your friend</li><li>especially in places you\u2019ve never been before</li><li>oh</li><li>you see adam talking his mouth off and you see the hot mystery man from yesterday leaning against the payment table just nodding his head</li><li>you\u2019re mind quickly panics !!! cause !!! wtf !!!</li><li>honestly you cant really figure out why you\u2019re panicking the way you are because hes just a normal person\u2026\u2026that just so happens to look like a child from a greek god and an angel</li><li>you go over to adam\u2019s side looking at your sneakers, kinda feeling clingy but whatever</li><li>you definitely feel a hard gaze on you from the man\u2019s eyes</li><li>adam\u2019s talking comes to an halt when he feels your presence, also your shoulder brushing against him</li><li>\u201csee anything you might want? maybe you should get a tattoo too y/n\u201d adam says winking at you</li><li>\u201cuhhhh definitely not\u201d you say, sure you\u2019d thought about tattoos but it wasn\u2019t a priority right now</li><li>\u201cboring anyways harry\u2026\u2026\u201d adam says and keeps on talking about his tattoo</li><li>oh, so the tattoo artist\u2019s name was harry, should\u2019ve figured out that earlier</li><li>guess no more calling him hot mystery man</li><li>still having his gaze on yours</li><li>\u201cso, who\u2019s this? got a new girlfriend, lad?\u201d the tattoo artist asks</li><li>and oh god</li><li>his voice</li><li>and he\u2019s british</li><li>almost makes you fall on your knees</li><li>\u201cy/n? nooo. still with emi, you know that!\u201d adam says and pats on his shoulder</li><li>you see harry nod</li><li>him being glad that you\u2019re not with adam so he would feel guilty about checking you out, he thinks</li><li>feels weird to call him harry you think</li><li>you see harry walks and wave his hand for you two too go where he goes</li><li>you end up on a cute little tattoo station, you\u2019d say and call it at least. it\u2019s probably wrong in the tattoo book</li><li>you grin when seeing the lollipops on the side of it, desperately wanting to take one but not knowing if you\u2019re allowed to</li><li>you\u2019re just so hungry and adam had promised you food, which isnt here</li><li>harry notices your look of desire and takes up the bowl of lollipops, still with your eyes on them, asking adam if he wanted one, adam saying no, and asking you if you\u2019d like one</li><li>you nod and smile and take a lollipop of your desire</li><li>you talk to adam some, calming his nerves about getting a tattoo</li><li>\u201cadam what are you even gonna get?\u201d you ask realizing you dont even know what hes getting, cause you zoned out when he talked about it</li><li>\u201cohhhh, today a bass guitar on my leg. go big or go home!\u201d adam says laughing</li><li>you smile, knowing how much he loves music and bass guitars</li><li>\u201cthat\u2019s cute\u201d you say and go back to calming his nerves</li><li>harry, quietly says too himself a \u201cyou\u2019re cute\u201d</li><li>he wonders what the hell is going trough him cause you are an absolute stranger, that he\u2019s never met before but god, after he saw you outside yesterday did he not stop thinking about the angel like person</li><li>the amount of joy that went though him when he saw you walking into his tattoo shop was shameful, he thought at least</li><li>he thinks it\u2019s lame that he\u2019s feeling like this</li><li>anyways, you open your lollipop before going to hold adam\u2019s hand, cause harry was done preparing everything and was ready to get started</li><li>but wow, it was hard for harry to focus correctly seeing that lollipop in your mouth, very much wishing it was something\u00a8</li><li>he curses at himself for thinking those things</li><li>during the tattoo, harry and adam talk some and you butt in whenever</li><li>however, even with how much you love your friend adam, you really wished he would shut up so you could listen to that amazing voice of harry\u2019s talk</li><li>cause, jeez, was it attractive and hot</li><li>a few lollipops and dark plumped lips later, a girl comes to the station with a bag off food</li><li>finally!! you think and accidentally end up saying out loud</li><li>both adam and harry laugh</li><li>aND his laugh!!!! the most amazing sound in the world you think</li><li>however, the man holding the tattoo gun across the room thinks differently</li><li>the times you let out a laugh or giggle he could just feel himself warming up with happiness</li><li>the thought if it being the most amazing sound in the world crosses his mind a LOT</li><li>you sigh of relief when you see the food that you absolutely adore, glad that adam knows you that well to order it</li><li>still holding adam\u2019s hand, you open both yours and adam\u2019s food, also taking harry\u2019s out, and begin to eat!</li><li>a few conversations later, the tattoo is done</li><li>you sigh knowing that you\u2019re probably never gonna see this gorgeous man ever again and tried to remember all the special details that made him him</li><li>\u201csee you next week harry!\u201d adam says</li><li>\u201cnext week?\u201d you ask</li><li>\u201cyea, gonna get another one next week\u201d adam says like it\u2019s obvious</li><li>\u201cwanna go with me? you made me feel better today so\u2026.i know emi would just laugh at my cries\u201d</li><li>\u201cyeah sure, dont have anything better to do\u201d you say grabbing another lollipop for the ride home</li><li>you and adam leave then, the man in the waiting room still there</li><li>and, harry knew damn well he was gonna buy a lot more lollipops next week.</li><li>a week paces and its saturday again</li><li>a lot of hanging out with adam and some of his friends</li><li>and going on many movie marathons with helene</li><li>feeling like deja vu, considering you were just in this car going to the tattoo place last week</li><li>harry had promised himself that he was gonna try and talk to you this time around, try and get to know you, he also could do this considering adam probably wouldnt be talking that much this time cause he\u2019s getting a tattoo on his ribs</li><li>he sees you and adam walk though the door, laughing\u00a0</li><li>god he wished he would be the one that could make you laugh like that</li><li>he thinks this whole crush thing has gotten too far, he knows / doubt you feel the same thing about him as he feels for you</li><li>he really isn\u2019t used to this</li><li>he always thought those romantic movies he saw with his sister and mother were lame and a never gonna happen thing</li><li>anyways, you smile at him and he smiles back which makes both of your tummy\u2019s bubble\u00a0</li><li>same station, same people but adam\u2019s in a different position, and \u00a0of course a lollipop in your mouth that harry tried his hardest not to focus on\u00a0</li><li>you where on harry\u2019s side this time, not across him</li><li>you could smell the scent of him which once again, made you weak to your knees\u00a0</li><li>and he could smell you, he tried not to let the scent of you and your closeness to him bother him that much, cause this is his job that he needs to focus on right now</li><li>also your question if he had tattoos on his neck was a no, no tattoo and just begging to be marked</li><li>\u201cever thought bout gettin a tattoo, doll?\u201d harry asks you, but still his eyes focusing on adam\u2019s ribs and his tattoo</li><li>\u201cmhmm, a little. wanna get one someday definitely but haven\u2019t figured out what or where yet though. but if i ever get one, you\u2019re the man too go to it seems like\u201d you say, kinda regretting the last part but you blame your nerves\u00a0</li><li>harry laughs at that and nods\u00a0</li><li>\u201cwhat about you? like, what\u2019s your favorite tattoo?\u201d</li><li>\u201ctoo many too choose from. maybe one day you can help me find my favorite, doll\u201d he says with a smirk playing on his lips</li><li>you definitely blushed at that and winced at the pain in your hand, being caused by adam</li><li>after that, the conversation just keeps on going</li><li>smaller questions leading to bigger answers</li><li>and more flirting on harry\u2019s part</li><li>and a lot of lollipops of on your part</li><li>adam lowkey had a smile on his face, knowing that harry wasnt the talkative type but kept answering your questions which adam knew harry probably would\u2019ve considered dumb if they came from anyone else\u2019s mouth\u00a0</li><li>sadly but quickly the tattoo was done, meaning you and harry had to go two different ways again</li><li>while adam\u2019s looking in the mirror, admiring the new art on his body</li><li>you and harry are talking, just about tattoos or whatever</li><li>suddenly an idea comes into adam\u2019s head</li><li>\u201chey y/n, didn\u2019t you need to get help to draw that perspective room drawing? harry, dude, why don\u2019t you helpt y/n out?\u201d adam asks, fully knowing that you were struggling and even though you didn\u2019t need to pass this class, you wanted to anyways</li><li>harry looks at you, honestly waiting for you too just say anything\u00a0</li><li>\u201ci mean, uh, i dont know, if you have time and would want too i\u2019d appreciate it\u201d you say, really not knowing what his reaction to this was\u00a0</li><li>\u201cyeah, if it\u2019d help you and you want do, lets do it\u201d harry says, definitely not knowing where this nervousness is coming from</li><li>lowkey / HIGHKEY very happy about this arrangement\u00a0</li><li>\u201calright!! when are you available? it\u2019s suppose to be done before the 3rd, so preferably sometime before that\u2026.\u201d you say smiling, noticing a smile on harry too</li><li>\u201cwell, im available tomorrow night, if you\u2019d like we can do it tomorrow\u201d harry said\u00a0</li><li>\u201cyeah! what time?\"\u00a0</li><li>\"well i have a tattoo appointment at five so i should be done at six so, how about six thirty?\u201d harry asks with a smirk\u00a0</li><li>\u201csure, see you then\u201d you say and grab adam\u2019s car keys and start heading out</li><li>the next day for you felt like forever</li><li>helene had a late morning which made you have a later morning\u00a0</li><li>classes weren\u2019t too entertaining\u00a0</li><li>a lot of thought about harry crossed your mind, too many times</li><li>about the time you got home you honestly just wanted to sleep</li><li>then you remembered you were seeing harry tonight\u00a0</li><li>and sure enough a smile and excitement hit you</li><li>you began to back your stuff, considering it was five fifteen and you where planning on walking\u00a0</li><li>you ate a little snack before heading off\u00a0</li><li>a few moments later you began your walk to the shop, coming a little late with a small mishap with that a kid needed to find their legal guardian</li><li>when you showed up, you saw harry alone cleaning up a station, assuming it was where he was tattooing\u00a0</li><li>his head lifts when he hears the bell ping from the door</li><li>\u201chi\u201d you say softly</li><li>\u201chello, doll face\u201d his velvety voice echoed\u00a0</li><li>\u201chow\u2019d the tattoo go?\u201d you ask, the question came naturally really\u00a0</li><li>\u201calright, guy was kinda a dick but what to do. most people are when being tattooed\u201d harry said and ended it with a smiler</li><li>he walked towards a door, waiting for you too be right behind him</li><li>you got the hint and quickly went over to him which made him laugh which then made you embarrassed\u00a0</li><li>he opened the door to a somewhat large room with a few unopened cardboard boxes, a few desks and just tattoo material a little everywhere</li><li>he pulled out two chairs to a desk, his desk assuming\u00a0</li><li>\u201cwell? you gonna show me what we\u2019re working on or are we just gonna wing it?\"\u00a0</li><li>\"oh yeah\u201d you say, bringing your laptop and a paper out, seeing that harry had already pulled out erasers and a pen</li><li>you showed him your assignment and what you had started with\u00a0</li><li>\u201cso, im kinda going for a museum vibe, if that makes sense. i saw a picture online where it was a museum in point perspective and i thought it looked cool and like something that i can actually do\u201d you say, hoping he\u2019s getting where you\u2019re going with your blabbering\u00a0</li><li>\u201co'kay, it looks good so far\u201d he says looking down at your paper</li><li>\u201cso what seems to be the problem if i may ask, princess?\u201d he says looking up at you</li><li>right into your eyes</li><li>god, those green eyes\u00a0</li><li>you could stare into them forever without a complaint leaving your mouth\u00a0</li><li>harry could say the same for you, but his eyes leaving yours and looking at your lips</li><li>what he would do to get a taste</li><li>hes not proud of it but he did think how her lips would taste right after she had eaten one of those damn lollipops\u00a0</li><li>and what that nickname did too you was</li><li>\u2026\u2026.not holy</li><li>\u201cwell i cant seem to get the art, that\u2019s suppose to represent paintings on the picture, all in a straight line to match the dot\u201d you say, trying your best to explain it</li><li>\u201cright, okay. it\u2019s gonna be a struggle considering i wanna teach you how to do it but also do it in a straight line when\u2026..when you know\u2026.where two people needing to see and do a one person thing\u201d harry said, very much hoping you got what he meant</li><li>you didnt</li><li>you scooted closer to harry\u00a0</li><li>making your shoulders and knees to touch\u00a0</li><li>harry smiled\u00a0</li><li>and grabbed a ruler to put in the middle and then draw a straight line</li><li>you sigh, not really understanding or seeing with his large hand and bicep blocking the view</li><li>\u201cyou kno what?\u201d harry says</li><li>you look at him with confusing all over your face</li><li>suddenly you feel two very large hands on your thigh moving you</li><li>making you sit on harry\u2019s lap</li><li>you didnt mind</li><li>you definitely didnt mind</li><li>neither did he</li><li>but you cheeks couldn\u2019t help themselves to blush a very very very dark red</li><li>\u201cgood?\u201d he asks\u00a0</li><li>\u201cvery\u201d you says quietly, really hoping he doesnt hear it</li><li>you sitting on his lap was very much a in the moment move for harry\u00a0</li><li>but god</li><li>did he love it</li><li>he also smirked at hearing you say very and smirked at the dark shade of red your cheeks were</li><li>\u201calright so\u2026..\u201d he says grabbing the ruler and keeps on explaining what to do and what not to do</li><li>it kinda ended you him doing your work for you while you\u2019re sitting in his lap, arm and hand behind his neck, softly playing with the small curls hoping he doesnt mind</li><li>he really doesnt mind this\u00a0</li><li>the feeling of your hands on the back of his neck playing with his hair makes him happy and soothes him</li><li>you really cant help but feel like this is inappropriate\u00a0</li><li>you dont even know if he\u2019s single</li><li>sure, yesterday you got to learn a lot about him but nothing about his love life</li><li>all these thoughts going through your head made you tired\u00a0</li><li>a yawn leaving your mouth indicating how tired you really were</li><li>\u201ctired, hmm?\u201d harry asks, knowing the obvious answer\u00a0</li><li>\u201cno, promise\u201d you say, obviously lying\u00a0</li><li>he grins and grabs the lollipops across the desk and gives you it</li><li>thinking it might wake you up a little</li><li>\u201cthank you\u201d you say, opening it\u00a0</li><li>\u201cdon\u2019t mention it, pretty\u201d he says, feeling happy that your happy\u00a0</li><li>\u201cyou\u2019re pretty\u201d you say quietly too yourself</li><li>harry smiles at that</li><li>the lollipop woke you up, turns out you just needed a little sugar in you</li><li>quickly you were back to commenting and asking on what he was doing and meaning</li><li>\u201call done!\u201d harry says</li><li>\u201cwow\u2026\u2026thank you for doing my assignment for me. i feel a lot better about this now. now im also done a week before it\u2019s suppose to be done!\u201d you say happily\u00a0</li><li>\u201cmmmm. glad i could help, doll\u201d harry says, feeling very happy and a warm feeling in his body</li><li>he turns his head, looking at you</li><li>you were already looking at him</li><li>you smile at this</li><li>he brushes a strand of your hair behind your ear with a dopey smile on his face</li><li>you giggled at the sudden affection\u00a0</li><li>or what you counted as affection\u00a0</li><li>he really wanted to hear that sound again</li><li>his hand not leaving you face and end up cupping your cheek\u00a0</li><li>the desire of touching and kissing your lips is driving him absolutely wild</li><li>his thumb caresses your cheek</li><li>\u201cuh\u201d you grunt\u00a0</li><li>he smiles\u00a0</li><li>he moves your legs</li><li>puts his hands on your hips, making you end up straddling him\u00a0</li><li>he leans back in his chair, enjoying the moment</li><li>her hands still playing with his hair, enjoying the feeling of his hair in your fingers</li><li>he really wants to kiss you</li><li>you really want to kiss him</li><li>\u201ccan i kiss you?\u201d harry asks softly for once, really not wanting to somehow scare you off</li><li>\u201cyeah\u201d you nod, really not wanting to show how desperate you really are</li><li>his soft lips softly brushing against yours, just a touch</li><li>his hands grabbing your hips, the tips of his fingers ending up on your ass, digging a little making you softly moan\u00a0</li><li>this gives him a chance to slide his tongue into yours</li><li>your hands meeting behind his neck, both ending up in his hair, pulling lightly\u00a0</li><li>you break away from the kiss\u00a0</li><li>taking in a gulp of fresh air</li><li>a pout forms on his lips</li><li>lips still chasing yours when you pull away</li><li>so to entertain himself</li><li>he starts kissing down your neck\u00a0</li><li>starts sucking on you, making his own art on you</li><li>one of his hands lowering to fully squeeze your ass\u00a0</li><li>making you moan once again</li><li>\u201cmmmmm\u201d

adam</li><li>\u201chey, don\u2019t forget about tomorrow night\u201d adam says to you and waves goodbye</li><li>you and adam where gonna go eat at subway or some other fast food place tomorrow cause why not????</li><li>it was his idea and you definitely didnt mind making new friends, and he was sweet and cute too but not your type but definitely your friend type!</li><li>anyways, you smile at him and try and get one of your hands free to wave at him back</li><li>your hand suddenly comes to a rest when you see him walk towards the mystery man you were lowkey just checking out</li><li>you see them do some hand shake hug and then you see adam nod aggressively, the other man laughing</li><li>the dark clothed man hops onto his motorcycle and suddenly he\u2019s gone</li><li>you\u2019d never thought adam to have such\u2026\u2026.badass friends</li><li>anyways</li><li>you go home, or well your dorm that you share with your roommate helene</li><li>helene was a foreign exchange student that you had quickly grown close with after a few weeks of knowing her, and you both had roommates you weren\u2019t clicking with so you both decided to just move in together</li><li>\u201chey!\u201d you hear her say</li><li>\u201chellooooo\u201d you say dragging the o\u2019s out while taking of your shoes</li><li>\u201coff to photography class?\u201d you ask her, knowing she was interested in photography and that was what she did majority of her free time</li><li>\u201cyou bet! i\u2019ll be home later then usual tonight so don\u2019t wait up for me and you can lock the door\u201d she says</li><li>you knew she was kinda popular, at least with the foreign exchange students group (that you didnt even know existed) and was probably gonna do something with them</li><li>you nod to what she says and wish her luck</li><li>a few movies and a few thoughts about the hot mystery man you saw today later you hear your phone ring</li><li>you grin comes across your face when you see adam\u2019s contact number</li><li>hinking that he was gonna ask you to pick him up again cause he\u2019s drunk and needed to crash somewhere somehow</li><li>\u201cheyoooo y/n, hope your not doing

also bought him food\u201d adam says shaking his head</li><li>\u201calrighty\u201d</li><li>you two walk out of the building and hop into his car, him driving the way too the tattoo place</li><li>\u201csoooooo, what are you gonna get?\u201d you ask</li><li>\u201cyou\u2019re just gonna have to wait and see\u201d he says with a smile</li><li>about ten minutes later, you arrive to a small but cute tattoo shop, with a little cafe next to it which makes it very convenient</li><li>you hear the bell ping when adam open\u2019s the door for you</li><li>the shop is nicely done, a few drawings wherever but clean and nice nonetheless</li><li>the smell off cologne reeks in the shop though</li><li>you turn to your left and see a older man, siting and waiting what looks like to get another tattoo on his already half tattooed arm</li><li>you smile at him and he returns the favor</li><li>your mama/papa/guardian raised you to be kind! even too strangers! especially too strangers!</li><li>after your eyes finish looking around your gaze goes back to adam</li><li>you dont find him at your side which kinda freaks you out</li><li>but then you look up, straight, and seeing him talk to someone</li><li>someone you cant see cause adam\u2019s big figure covers the mystery person</li><li>you go over to adam cause you wanna be with your friend</li><li>especially in places you\u2019ve never been before</li><li>oh</li><li>you see adam talking his mouth off and you see the hot mystery man from yesterday leaning against the payment table just nodding his head</li><li>you\u2019re mind quickly panics !!! cause !!! wtf !!!</li><li>honestly you cant really figure out why you\u2019re panicking the way you are because hes just a normal person\u2026\u2026that just so happens to look like a child from a greek god and an angel</li><li>you go over to adam\u2019s side looking at your sneakers, kinda feeling clingy but whatever</li><li>you definitely feel a hard gaze on you from the man\u2019s eyes</li><li>adam\u2019s talking comes to an halt when he feels your presence, also your shoulder brushing against him</li><li>\u201csee anything you might want? maybe you should get a tattoo too y/n\u201d adam says winking at you</li><li>\u201cuhhhh definitely not\u201d you say, sure you\u2019d thought about tattoos but it wasn\u2019t a priority right now</li><li>\u201cboring anyways harry\u2026\u2026\u201d adam says and keeps on talking about his tattoo</li><li>oh, so the tattoo artist\u2019s name was harry, should\u2019ve figured out that earlier</li><li>guess no more calling him hot mystery man</li><li>still having his gaze on yours</li><li>\u201cso, who\u2019s this? got a new girlfriend, lad?\u201d the tattoo artist asks</li><li>and oh god</li><li>his voice</li><li>and he\u2019s british</li><li>almost makes you fall on your knees</li><li>\u201cy/n? nooo. still with emi, you know that!\u201d adam says and pats on his shoulder</li><li>you see harry nod</li><li>him being glad that you\u2019re not with adam so he would feel guilty about checking you out, he thinks</li><li>feels weird to call him harry you think</li><li>you see harry walks and wave his hand for you two too go where he goes</li><li>you end up on a cute little tattoo station, you\u2019d say and call it at least. it\u2019s probably wrong in the tattoo book</li><li>you grin when seeing the lollipops on the side of it, desperately wanting to take one but not knowing if you\u2019re allowed to</li><li>you\u2019re just so hungry and adam had promised you food, which isnt here</li><li>harry notices your look of desire and takes up the bowl of lollipops, still with your eyes on them, asking adam if he wanted one, adam saying no, and asking you if you\u2019d like one</li><li>you nod and smile and take a lollipop of your desire</li><li>you talk to adam some, calming his nerves about getting a tattoo</li><li>\u201cadam what are you even gonna get?\u201d you ask realizing you dont even know what hes getting, cause you zoned out when he talked about it</li><li>\u201cohhhh, today a bass guitar on my leg. go big or go home!\u201d adam says laughing</li><li>you smile, knowing how much he loves music and bass guitars</li><li>\u201cthat\u2019s cute\u201d you say and go back to calming his nerves</li><li>harry, quietly says too himself a \u201cyou\u2019re cute\u201d</li><li>he wonders what the hell is going trough him cause you are an absolute stranger, that he\u2019s never met before but god, after he saw you outside yesterday did he not stop thinking about the angel like person</li><li>the amount of joy that went though him when he saw you walking into his tattoo shop was shameful, he thought at least</li><li>he thinks it\u2019s lame that he\u2019s feeling like this</li><li>anyways, you open your lollipop before going to hold adam\u2019s hand, cause harry was done preparing everything and was ready to get started</li><li>but wow, it was hard for harry to focus correctly seeing that lollipop in your mouth, very much wishing it was something\u00a8</li><li>he curses at himself for thinking those things</li><li>during the tattoo, harry and adam talk some and you butt in whenever</li><li>however, even with how much you love your friend adam, you really wished he would shut up so you could listen to that amazing voice of harry\u2019s talk</li><li>cause, jeez, was it attractive and hot</li><li>a few lollipops and dark plumped lips later, a girl comes to the station with a bag off food</li><li>finally!! you think and accidentally end up saying out loud</li><li>both adam and harry laugh</li><li>aND his laugh!!!! the most amazing sound in the world you think</li><li>however, the man holding the tattoo gun across the room thinks differently</li><li>the times you let out a laugh or giggle he could just feel himself warming up with happiness</li><li>the thought if it being the most amazing sound in the world crosses his mind a LOT</li><li>you sigh of relief when you see the food that you absolutely adore, glad that adam knows you that well to order it</li><li>still holding adam\u2019s hand, you open both yours and adam\u2019s food, also taking harry\u2019s out, and begin to eat!</li><li>a few conversations later, the tattoo is done</li><li>you sigh knowing that you\u2019re probably never gonna see this gorgeous man ever again and tried to remember all the special details that made him him</li><li>\u201csee you next week harry!\u201d adam says</li><li>\u201cnext week?\u201d you ask</li><li>\u201cyea, gonna get another one next week\u201d adam says like it\u2019s obvious</li><li>\u201cwanna go with me? you made me feel better today so\u2026.i know emi would just laugh at my cries\u201d</li><li>\u201cyeah sure, dont have anything better to do\u201d you say grabbing another lollipop for the ride home</li><li>you and adam leave then, the man in the waiting room still there</li><li>and, harry knew damn well he was gonna buy a lot more lollipops next week.</li><li>a week paces and its saturday again</li><li>a lot of hanging out with adam and some of his friends</li><li>and going on many movie marathons with helene</li><li>feeling like deja vu, considering you were just in this car going to the tattoo place last week</li><li>harry had promised himself that he was gonna try and talk to you this time around, try and get to know you, he also could do this considering adam probably wouldnt be talking that much this time cause he\u2019s getting a tattoo on his ribs</li><li>he sees you and adam walk though the door, laughing\u00a0</li><li>god he wished he would be the one that could make you laugh like that</li><li>he thinks this whole crush thing has gotten too far, he knows / doubt you feel the same thing about him as he feels for you</li><li>he really isn\u2019t used to this</li><li>he always thought those romantic movies he saw with his sister and mother were lame and a never gonna happen thing</li><li>anyways, you smile at him and he smiles back which makes both of your tummy\u2019s bubble\u00a0</li><li>same station, same people but adam\u2019s in a different position, and \u00a0of course a lollipop in your mouth that harry tried his hardest not to focus on\u00a0</li><li>you where on harry\u2019s side this time, not across him</li><li>you could smell the scent of him which once again, made you weak to your knees\u00a0</li><li>and he could smell you, he tried not to let the scent of you and your closeness to him bother him that much, cause this is his job that he needs to focus on right now</li><li>also your question if he had tattoos on his neck was a no, no tattoo and just begging to be marked</li><li>\u201cever thought bout gettin a tattoo, doll?\u201d harry asks you, but still his eyes focusing on adam\u2019s ribs and his tattoo</li><li>\u201cmhmm, a little. wanna get one someday definitely but haven\u2019t figured out what or where yet though. but if i ever get one, you\u2019re the man too go to it seems like\u201d you say, kinda regretting the last part but you blame your nerves\u00a0</li><li>harry laughs at that and nods\u00a0</li><li>\u201cwhat about you? like, what\u2019s your favorite tattoo?\u201d</li><li>\u201ctoo many too choose from. maybe one day you can help me find my favorite, doll\u201d he says with a smirk playing on his lips</li><li>you definitely blushed at that and winced at the pain in your hand, being caused by adam</li><li>after that, the conversation just keeps on going</li><li>smaller questions leading to bigger answers</li><li>and more flirting on harry\u2019s part</li><li>and a lot of lollipops of on your part</li><li>adam lowkey had a smile on his face, knowing that harry wasnt the talkative type but kept answering your questions which adam knew harry probably would\u2019ve considered dumb if they came from anyone else\u2019s mouth\u00a0</li><li>sadly but quickly the tattoo was done, meaning you and harry had to go two different ways again</li><li>while adam\u2019s looking in the mirror, admiring the new art on his body</li><li>you and harry are talking, just about tattoos or whatever</li><li>suddenly an idea comes into adam\u2019s head</li><li>\u201chey y/n, didn\u2019t you need to get help to draw that perspective room drawing? harry, dude, why don\u2019t you helpt y/n out?\u201d adam asks, fully knowing that you were struggling and even though you didn\u2019t need to pass this class, you wanted to anyways</li><li>harry looks at you, honestly waiting for you too just say anything\u00a0</li><li>\u201ci mean, uh, i dont know, if you have time and would want too i\u2019d appreciate it\u201d you say, really not knowing what his reaction to this was\u00a0</li><li>\u201cyeah, if it\u2019d help you and you want do, lets do it\u201d harry says, definitely not knowing where this nervousness is coming from</li><li>lowkey / HIGHKEY very happy about this arrangement\u00a0</li><li>\u201calright!! when are you available? it\u2019s suppose to be done before the 3rd, so preferably sometime before that\u2026.\u201d you say smiling, noticing a smile on harry too</li><li>\u201cwell, im available tomorrow night, if you\u2019d like we can do it tomorrow\u201d harry said\u00a0</li><li>\u201cyeah! what time?\"\u00a0</li><li>\"well i have a tattoo appointment at five so i should be done at six so, how about six thirty?\u201d harry asks with a smirk\u00a0</li><li>\u201csure, see you then\u201d you say and grab adam\u2019s car keys and start heading out</li><li>the next day for you felt like forever</li><li>helene had a late morning which made you have a later morning\u00a0</li><li>classes weren\u2019t too entertaining\u00a0</li><li>a lot of thought about harry crossed your mind, too many times</li><li>about the time you got home you honestly just wanted to sleep</li><li>then you remembered you were seeing harry tonight\u00a0</li><li>and sure enough a smile and excitement hit you</li><li>you began to back your stuff, considering it was five fifteen and you where planning on walking\u00a0</li><li>you ate a little snack before heading off\u00a0</li><li>a few moments later you began your walk to the shop, coming a little late with a small mishap with that a kid needed to find their legal guardian</li><li>when you showed up, you saw harry alone cleaning up a station, assuming it was where he was tattooing\u00a0</li><li>his head lifts when he hears the bell ping from the door</li><li>\u201chi\u201d you say softly</li><li>\u201chello, doll face\u201d his velvety voice echoed\u00a0</li><li>\u201chow\u2019d the tattoo go?\u201d you ask, the question came naturally really\u00a0</li><li>\u201calright, guy was kinda a dick but what to do. most people are when being tattooed\u201d harry said and ended it with a smiler</li><li>he walked towards a door, waiting for you too be right behind him</li><li>you got the hint and quickly went over to him which made him laugh which then made you embarrassed\u00a0</li><li>he opened the door to a somewhat large room with a few unopened cardboard boxes, a few desks and just tattoo material a little everywhere</li><li>he pulled out two chairs to a desk, his desk assuming\u00a0</li><li>\u201cwell? you gonna show me what we\u2019re working on or are we just gonna wing it?\"\u00a0</li><li>\"oh yeah\u201d you say, bringing your laptop and a paper out, seeing that harry had already pulled out erasers and a pen</li><li>you showed him your assignment and what you had started with\u00a0</li><li>\u201cso, im kinda going for a museum vibe, if that makes sense. i saw a picture online where it was a museum in point perspective and i thought it looked cool and like something that i can actually do\u201d you say, hoping he\u2019s getting where you\u2019re going with your blabbering\u00a0</li><li>\u201co'kay, it looks good so far\u201d he says looking down at your paper</li><li>\u201cso what seems to be the problem if i may ask, princess?\u201d he says looking up at you</li><li>right into your eyes</li><li>god, those green eyes\u00a0</li><li>you could stare into them forever without a complaint leaving your mouth\u00a0</li><li>harry could say the same for you, but his eyes leaving yours and looking at your lips</li><li>what he would do to get a taste</li><li>hes not proud of it but he did think how her lips would taste right after she had eaten one of those damn lollipops\u00a0</li><li>and what that nickname did too you was</li><li>\u2026\u2026.not holy</li><li>\u201cwell i cant seem to get the art, that\u2019s suppose to represent paintings on the picture, all in a straight line to match the dot\u201d you say, trying your best to explain it</li><li>\u201cright, okay. it\u2019s gonna be a struggle considering i wanna teach you how to do it but also do it in a straight line when\u2026..when you know\u2026.where two people needing to see and do a one person thing\u201d harry said, very much hoping you got what he meant</li><li>you didnt</li><li>you scooted closer to harry\u00a0</li><li>making your shoulders and knees to touch\u00a0</li><li>harry smiled\u00a0</li><li>and grabbed a ruler to put in the middle and then draw a straight line</li><li>you sigh, not really understanding or seeing with his large hand and bicep blocking the view</li><li>\u201cyou kno what?\u201d harry says</li><li>you look at him with confusing all over your face</li><li>suddenly you feel two very large hands on your thigh moving you</li><li>making you sit on harry\u2019s lap</li><li>you didnt mind</li><li>you definitely didnt mind</li><li>neither did he</li><li>but you cheeks couldn\u2019t help themselves to blush a very very very dark red</li><li>\u201cgood?\u201d he asks\u00a0</li><li>\u201cvery\u201d you says quietly, really hoping he doesnt hear it</li><li>you sitting on his lap was very much a in the moment move for harry\u00a0</li><li>but god</li><li>did he love it</li><li>he also smirked at hearing you say very and smirked at the dark shade of red your cheeks were</li><li>\u201calright so\u2026..\u201d he says grabbing the ruler and keeps on explaining what to do and what not to do</li><li>it kinda ended you him doing your work for you while you\u2019re sitting in his lap, arm and hand behind his neck, softly playing with the small curls hoping he doesnt mind</li><li>he really doesnt mind this\u00a0</li><li>the feeling of your hands on the back of his neck playing with his hair makes him happy and soothes him</li><li>you really cant help but feel like this is inappropriate\u00a0</li><li>you dont even know if he\u2019s single</li><li>sure, yesterday you got to learn a lot about him but nothing about his love life</li><li>all these thoughts going through your head made you tired\u00a0</li><li>a yawn leaving your mouth indicating how tired you really were</li><li>\u201ctired, hmm?\u201d harry asks, knowing the obvious answer\u00a0</li><li>\u201cno, promise\u201d you say, obviously lying\u00a0</li><li>he grins and grabs the lollipops across the desk and gives you it</li><li>thinking it might wake you up a little</li><li>\u201cthank you\u201d you say, opening it\u00a0</li><li>\u201cdon\u2019t mention it, pretty\u201d he says, feeling happy that your happy\u00a0</li><li>\u201cyou\u2019re pretty\u201d you say quietly too yourself</li><li>harry smiles at that</li><li>the lollipop woke you up, turns out you just needed a little sugar in you</li><li>quickly you were back to commenting and asking on what he was doing and meaning</li><li>\u201call done!\u201d harry says</li><li>\u201cwow\u2026\u2026thank you for doing my assignment for me. i feel a lot better about this now. now im also done a week before it\u2019s suppose to be done!\u201d you say happily\u00a0</li><li>\u201cmmmm. glad i could help, doll\u201d harry says, feeling very happy and a warm feeling in his body</li><li>he turns his head, looking at you</li><li>you were already looking at him</li><li>you smile at this</li><li>he brushes a strand of your hair behind your ear with a dopey smile on his face</li><li>you giggled at the sudden affection\u00a0</li><li>or what you counted as affection\u00a0</li><li>he really wanted to hear that sound again</li><li>his hand not leaving you face and end up cupping your cheek\u00a0</li><li>the desire of touching and kissing your lips is driving him absolutely wild</li><li>his thumb caresses your cheek</li><li>\u201cuh\u201d you grunt\u00a0</li><li>he smiles\u00a0</li><li>he moves your legs</li><li>puts his hands on your hips, making you end up straddling him\u00a0</li><li>he leans back in his chair, enjoying the moment</li><li>her hands still playing with his hair, enjoying the feeling of his hair in your fingers</li><li>he really wants to kiss you</li><li>you really want to kiss him</li><li>\u201ccan i kiss you?\u201d harry asks softly for once, really not wanting to somehow scare you off</li><li>\u201cyeah\u201d you nod, really not wanting to show how desperate you really are</li><li>his soft lips softly brushing against yours, just a touch</li><li>his hands grabbing your hips, the tips of his fingers ending up on your ass, digging a little making you softly moan\u00a0</li><li>this gives him a chance to slide his tongue into yours</li><li>your hands meeting behind his neck, both ending up in his hair, pulling lightly\u00a0</li><li>you break away from the kiss\u00a0</li><li>taking in a gulp of fresh air</li><li>a pout forms on his lips</li><li>lips still chasing yours when you pull away</li><li>so to entertain himself</li><li>he starts kissing down your neck\u00a0</li><li>starts sucking on you, making his own art on you</li><li>one of his hands lowering to fully squeeze your ass\u00a0</li><li>making you moan once again</li><li>\u201cmmmmm\u201d he says and laughs softly\u00a0</li><li>\u201cthank you\u201d you say\u00a0</li><li>\u201chmm? for what, lovie?\u201d he asks curiously\u00a0</li><li>\u201cfor asking for permission\u201d you say with

you smile\u00a0</li><li>he presses a kiss on your forehead, with your hands still playing on his curls on his pretty head\u00a0</li><li>anyways, time passes a bit and you two just enjoy each others presence</li><li>\u201cwhats the time?\u201d you ask</li><li>he looks up at the clock</li><li>\u201c9:45pm\"\u00a0</li><li>\"what? no way, ive been here that long\"\u00a0</li><li>\"seems like it\u201d

you ask</li><li>&ldquo;you&rsquo;re just gonna have to wait and see&rdquo; he says with a smile</li><li>about ten minutes later, you arrive to a small but cute tattoo shop, with a little cafe next to it which makes it very convenient</li><li>you hear the bell ping when adam open&rsquo;s the door for you</li><li>the shop is nicely done, a few drawings wherever but clean and nice nonetheless</li><li>the smell off cologne reeks in the shop though</li><li>you turn to your left and see a older man, siting and waiting what looks like to get another tattoo on his already half tattooed arm</li><li>you smile at him and he returns the favor</li><li>your mama/papa/guardian raised you to be kind! even too strangers! especially too strangers!</li><li>after your eyes finish looking around your gaze goes back to adam</li><li>you dont find him at your side which kinda freaks you out</li><li>but then you look up, straight, and seeing him talk to someone</li><li>someone you cant see cause adam&rsquo;s big figure covers the mystery person</li><li>you go over to adam cause you wanna be with your friend</li><li>especially in places you&rsquo;ve never been before</li><li>oh</li><li>you see adam talking his mouth off and you see the hot mystery man from yesterday leaning against the payment table just nodding his head</li><li>you&rsquo;re mind quickly panics !!! cause !!! wtf !!!</li><li>honestly you cant really figure out why you&rsquo;re panicking the way you are because hes just a normal person&hellip;&hellip;that just so happens to look like a child from a greek god and an angel</li><li>you go over to adam&rsquo;s side looking at your sneakers, kinda feeling clingy but whatever</li><li>you definitely feel a hard gaze on you from the man&rsquo;s eyes</li><li>adam&rsquo;s talking comes to an halt when he feels your presence, also your shoulder brushing against him</li><li>&ldquo;see anything you might want? maybe you should get a tattoo too y/n&rdquo; adam says winking at you</li><li>&ldquo;uhhhh definitely not&rdquo; you say, sure you&rsquo;d thought about tattoos but it wasn&rsquo;t a priority right now</li><li>&ldquo;boring anyways harry&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo; adam says and keeps on talking about his tattoo</li><li>oh, so the tattoo artist&rsquo;s name was harry, should&rsquo;ve figured out that earlier</li><li>guess no more calling him hot mystery man</li><li>still having his gaze on yours</li><li>&ldquo;so, who&rsquo;s this? got a new girlfriend, lad?&rdquo; the tattoo artist asks</li><li>and oh god</li><li>his voice</li><li>and he&rsquo;s british</li><li>almost makes you fall on your knees</li><li>&ldquo;y/n? nooo. still with emi, you know that!&rdquo; adam says and pats on his shoulder</li><li>you see harry nod</li><li>him being glad that you&rsquo;re not with adam so he would feel guilty about checking you out, he thinks</li><li>feels weird to call him harry you think</li><li>you see harry walks and wave his hand for you two too go where he goes</li><li>you end up on a cute little tattoo station, you&rsquo;d say and call it at least. it&rsquo;s probably wrong in the tattoo book</li><li>you grin when seeing the lollipops on the side of it, desperately wanting to take one but not knowing if you&rsquo;re allowed to</li><li>you&rsquo;re just so hungry and adam had promised you food, which isnt here</li><li>harry notices your look of desire and takes up the bowl of lollipops, still with your eyes on them, asking adam if he wanted one, adam saying no, and asking you if you&rsquo;d like one</li><li>you nod and smile and take a lollipop of your desire</li><li>you talk to adam some, calming his nerves about getting a tattoo</li><li>&ldquo;adam what are you even gonna get?&rdquo; you ask realizing you dont even know what hes getting, cause you zoned out when he talked about it</li><li>&ldquo;ohhhh, today a bass guitar on my leg. go big or go home!&rdquo; adam says laughing</li><li>you smile, knowing how much he loves music and bass guitars</li><li>&ldquo;that&rsquo;s cute&rdquo; you say and go back to calming his nerves</li><li>harry, quietly says too himself a &ldquo;you&rsquo;re cute&rdquo;</li><li>he wonders what the hell is going trough him cause you are an absolute stranger, that he&rsquo;s never met before but god, after he saw you outside yesterday did he not stop thinking about the angel like person</li><li>the amount of joy that went though him when he saw you walking into his tattoo shop was shameful, he thought at least</li><li>he thinks it&rsquo;s lame that he&rsquo;s feeling like this</li><li>anyways, you open your lollipop before going to hold adam&rsquo;s hand, cause harry was done preparing everything and was ready to get started</li><li>but wow, it was hard for harry to focus correctly seeing that lollipop in your mouth, very much wishing it was something&uml;</li><li>he curses at himself for thinking those things</li><li>during the tattoo, harry and adam talk some and you butt in whenever</li><li>however, even with how much you love your friend adam, you really wished he would shut up so you could listen to that amazing voice of harry&rsquo;s talk</li><li>cause, jeez, was it attractive and hot</li><li>a few lollipops and dark plumped lips later, a girl comes to the station with a bag off food</li><li>finally!! you think and accidentally end up saying out loud</li><li>both adam and harry laugh</li><li>aND his laugh!!!! the most amazing sound in the world you think</li><li>however, the man holding the tattoo gun across the room thinks differently</li><li>the times you let out a laugh or giggle he could just feel himself warming up with happiness</li><li>the thought if it being the most amazing sound in the world crosses his mind a LOT</li><li>you sigh of relief when you see the food that you absolutely adore, glad that adam knows you that well to order it</li><li>still holding adam&rsquo;s hand, you open both yours and adam&rsquo;s food, also taking harry&rsquo;s out, and begin to eat!</li><li>a few conversations later, the tattoo is done</li><li>you sigh knowing that you&rsquo;re probably never gonna see this gorgeous man ever again and tried to remember all the special details that made him him</li><li>&ldquo;see you next week harry!&rdquo; adam says</li><li>&ldquo;next week?&rdquo; you ask</li><li>&ldquo;yea, gonna get another one next week&rdquo; adam says like it&rsquo;s obvious</li><li>&ldquo;wanna go with me? you made me feel better today so&hellip;.i know emi would just laugh at my cries&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;yeah sure, dont have anything better to do&rdquo; you say grabbing another lollipop for the ride home</li><li>you and adam leave then, the man in the waiting room still there</li><li>and, harry knew damn well he was gonna buy a lot more lollipops next week.</li><li>a week paces and its saturday again</li><li>a lot of hanging out with adam and some of his friends</li><li>and going on many movie marathons with helene</li><li>feeling like deja vu, considering you were just in this car going to the tattoo place last week</li><li>harry had promised himself that he was gonna try and talk to you this time around, try and get to know you, he also could do this considering adam probably wouldnt be talking that much this time cause he&rsquo;s getting a tattoo on his ribs</li><li>he sees you and adam walk though the door, laughing&nbsp;</li><li>god he wished he would be the one that could make you laugh like that</li><li>he thinks this whole crush thing has gotten too far, he knows / doubt you feel the same thing about him as he feels for you</li><li>he really isn&rsquo;t used to this</li><li>he always thought those romantic movies he saw with his sister and mother were lame and a never gonna happen thing</li><li>anyways, you smile at him and he smiles back which makes both of your tummy&rsquo;s bubble&nbsp;</li><li>same station, same people but adam&rsquo;s in a different position, and &nbsp;of course a lollipop in your mouth that harry tried his hardest not to focus on&nbsp;</li><li>you where on harry&rsquo;s side this time, not across him</li><li>you could smell the scent of him which once again, made you weak to your knees&nbsp;</li><li>and he could smell you, he tried not to let the scent of you and your closeness to him bother him that much, cause this is his job that he needs to focus on right now</li><li>also your question if he had tattoos on his neck was a no, no tattoo and just begging to be marked</li><li>&ldquo;ever thought bout gettin a tattoo, doll?&rdquo; harry asks you, but still his eyes focusing on adam&rsquo;s ribs and his tattoo</li><li>&ldquo;mhmm, a little. wanna get one someday definitely but haven&rsquo;t figured out what or where yet though. but if i ever get one, you&rsquo;re the man too go to it seems like&rdquo; you say, kinda regretting the last part but you blame your nerves&nbsp;</li><li>harry laughs at that and nods&nbsp;</li><li>&ldquo;what about you? like, what&rsquo;s your favorite tattoo?&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;too many too choose from. maybe one day you can help me find my favorite, doll&rdquo; he says with a smirk playing on his lips</li><li>you definitely blushed at that and winced at the pain in your hand, being caused by adam</li><li>after that, the conversation just keeps on going</li><li>smaller questions leading to bigger answers</li><li>and more flirting on harry&rsquo;s part</li><li>and a lot of lollipops of on your part</li><li>adam lowkey had a smile on his face, knowing that harry wasnt the talkative type but kept answering your questions which adam knew harry probably would&rsquo;ve considered dumb if they came from anyone else&rsquo;s mouth&nbsp;</li><li>sadly but quickly the tattoo was done, meaning you and harry had to go two different ways again</li><li>while adam&rsquo;s looking in the mirror, admiring the new art on his body</li><li>you and harry are talking, just about tattoos or whatever</li><li>suddenly an idea comes into adam&rsquo;s head</li><li>&ldquo;hey y/n, didn&rsquo;t you need to get help to draw that perspective room drawing? harry, dude, why don&rsquo;t you helpt y/n out?&rdquo; adam asks, fully knowing that you were struggling and even though you didn&rsquo;t need to pass this class, you wanted to anyways</li><li>harry looks at you, honestly waiting for you too just say anything&nbsp;</li><li>&ldquo;i mean, uh, i dont know, if you have time and would want too i&rsquo;d appreciate it&rdquo; you say, really not knowing what his reaction to this was&nbsp;</li><li>&ldquo;yeah, if it&rsquo;d help you and you want do, lets do it&rdquo; harry says, definitely not knowing where this nervousness is coming from</li><li>lowkey / HIGHKEY very happy about this arrangement&nbsp;</li><li>&ldquo;alright!! when are you available? it&rsquo;s suppose to be done before the 3rd, so preferably sometime before that&hellip;.&rdquo; you say smiling, noticing a smile on harry too</li><li>&ldquo;well, im available tomorrow night, if you&rsquo;d like we can do it tomorrow&rdquo; harry said&nbsp;</li><li>&ldquo;yeah! what time?\"&nbsp;</li><li>\"well i have a tattoo appointment at five so i should be done at six so, how about six thirty?&rdquo; harry asks with a smirk&nbsp;</li><li>&ldquo;sure, see you then&rdquo; you say and grab adam&rsquo;s car keys and start heading out</li><li>the next day for you felt like forever</li><li>helene had a late morning which made you have a later morning&nbsp;</li><li>classes weren&rsquo;t too entertaining&nbsp;</li><li>a lot of thought about harry crossed your mind, too many times</li><li>about the time you got home you honestly just wanted to sleep</li><li>then you remembered you were seeing harry tonight&nbsp;</li><li>and sure enough a smile and excitement hit you</li><li>you began to back your stuff, considering it was five fifteen and you where planning on walking&nbsp;</li><li>you ate a little snack before heading off&nbsp;</li><li>a few moments later you began your walk to the shop, coming a little late with a small mishap with that a kid needed to find their legal guardian</li><li>when you showed up, you saw harry alone cleaning up a station, assuming it was where he was tattooing&nbsp;</li><li>his head lifts when he hears the bell ping from the door</li><li>&ldquo;hi&rdquo; you say softly</li><li>&ldquo;hello, doll face&rdquo; his velvety voice echoed&nbsp;</li><li>&ldquo;how&rsquo;d the tattoo go?&rdquo; you ask, the question came naturally really&nbsp;</li><li>&ldquo;alright, guy was kinda a dick but what to do. most people are when being tattooed&rdquo; harry said and ended it with a smiler</li><li>he walked towards a door, waiting for you too be right behind him</li><li>you got the hint and quickly went over to him which made him laugh which then made you embarrassed&nbsp;</li><li>he opened the door to a somewhat large room with a few unopened cardboard boxes, a few desks and just tattoo material a little everywhere</li><li>he pulled out two chairs to a desk, his desk assuming&nbsp;</li><li>&ldquo;well? you gonna show me what we&rsquo;re working on or are we just gonna wing it?\"&nbsp;</li><li>\"oh yeah&rdquo; you say, bringing your laptop and a paper out, seeing that harry had already pulled out erasers and a pen</li><li>you showed him your assignment and what you had started with&nbsp;</li><li>&ldquo;so, im kinda going for a museum vibe, if that makes sense. i saw a picture online where it was a museum in point perspective and i thought it looked cool and like something that i can actually do&rdquo; you say, hoping he&rsquo;s getting where you&rsquo;re going with your blabbering&nbsp;</li><li>&ldquo;o'kay, it looks good so far&rdquo; he says looking down at your paper</li><li>&ldquo;so what seems to be the problem if i may ask, princess?&rdquo; he says looking up at you</li><li>right into your eyes</li><li>god, those green eyes&nbsp;</li><li>you could stare into them forever without a complaint leaving your mouth&nbsp;</li><li>harry could say the same for you, but his eyes leaving yours and looking at your lips</li><li>what he would do to get a taste</li><li>hes not proud of it but he did think how her lips would taste right after she had eaten one of those damn lollipops&nbsp;</li><li>and what that nickname did too you was</li><li>&hellip;&hellip;.not holy</li><li>&ldquo;well i cant seem to get the art, that&rsquo;s suppose to represent paintings on the picture, all in a straight line to match the dot&rdquo; you say, trying your best to explain it</li><li>&ldquo;right, okay. it&rsquo;s gonna be a struggle considering i wanna teach you how to do it but also do it in a straight line when&hellip;..when you know&hellip;.where two people needing to see and do a one person thing&rdquo; harry said, very much hoping you got what he meant</li><li>you didnt</li><li>you scooted closer to harry&nbsp;</li><li>making your shoulders and knees to touch&nbsp;</li><li>harry smiled&nbsp;</li><li>and grabbed a ruler to put in the middle and then draw a straight line</li><li>you sigh, not really understanding or seeing with his large hand and bicep blocking the view</li><li>&ldquo;you kno what?&rdquo; harry says</li><li>you look at him with confusing all over your face</li><li>suddenly you feel two very large hands on your thigh moving you</li><li>making you sit on harry&rsquo;s lap</li><li>you didnt mind</li><li>you definitely didnt mind</li><li>neither did he</li><li>but you cheeks couldn&rsquo;t help themselves to blush a very very very dark red</li><li>&ldquo;good?&rdquo; he asks&nbsp;</li><li>&ldquo;very&rdquo; you says quietly, really hoping he doesnt hear it</li><li>you sitting on his lap was very much a in the moment move for harry&nbsp;</li><li>but god</li><li>did he love it</li><li>he also smirked at hearing you say very and smirked at the dark shade of red your cheeks were</li><li>&ldquo;alright so&hellip;..&rdquo;

Here is the second part! And before you read I just wanna\nsay I\u2019m shit at writing smut so idk if it\u2019s any good but hope you guys like it!\nAnd feedback is very much appricieted! </i></b></p><p>Harry wasn\u2019t sure what he was seeing was true or not. He didn\u2019t know if he\nwas dreaming or if it was really the reality. He didn\u2019t know if the girl\nstanding across the street was really her or if he was hallucinating or if he\nwas just confusing her with someone else.</p><p>But, the girl had the same black hair -styled the same way, same tan skin,\nlips just as plump and eyes glistering the same way. However, he couldn\u2019t\nbelieve his eyes. Maybe he was dreaming again or maybe it was someone else. But\nhow could it be someone else, he was sure he knew every single feature of hers.\nFrom all the dreams and imaginations he was having from past 7 months, he was\ncertain he knew every inch of her. And the girl across the street- Harry was\nsure it was either her or it was just his imagination.</p><p>The traffic light turned red as everyone hurriedly crossed the road. Harry\nwas supposed to cross it too, but he didn\u2019t, he remained rooted to his spot as\nhe saw her cross the road. She was looking down at her feet not yet registering\nHarry\u2019s biddy eyes on her.</p><p>But, soon she did. Just after looking up, her eyes fell on him, as her lips\nparted just like the night he first saw her at the concert.</p><p>Harry smiled awkwardly as he waved.</p><p>It was really her!</p><p>It had been 7 months since that night and Harry had lost all hope to find\nher. At first he stopped himself for searching her, but when she started to\ntake over his mind and even resulted him in writing three songs about her,\nHarry was sure he needed to find her. It al started from Harry frantically\ncalling Jeff at 2 in the morning asking for the footage of that night and if he\nhad any idea who she was. Then getting in contact with the guard, David who had\nhanded her the camera, he even started to spend three hours, everyday on Instagram\njust in hope of finding her. But he didn\u2019t. He found that night\u2019s video in a\nlot of places but no one knew who that girl was and simply he concluded he\nmight never find her. However, there she was, after 7 months she was there,\nwalking towards him, looking like nothing but Aphrodite.</p><p>She waved back with a smile just as awkward</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Harry said stuffing both of his hand in his front pocket.\nHe was nervous. He was so fucking nervous. He didn\u2019t know what it was about her\nthat made his palm sweat and mind fuzzy. He never felt that way for a girl, a\ngirl never made him that nervous.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she replied shyly tucking a strand of her hair behind her\near.</p><p>And Harry felt like he\u2019d lose control. She was too beautiful, too innocent\nto be even real. How did she even manage to take those pictures, she was too\ninnocent for that.</p><p>\u201cNever saw you around here,\u201d Harry said trying his best to cover\nup his nervousness.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah, I - I usually drive, but my car decided to break down\nyesterday so yeah,\u201d she said pulling on the straps of her back pack.\n\u201cYou come here often?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, actually I always use this route\u2026.usually go to the park in\nthe evening for a run,\u201d Harry smiled.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d An awkward silence fell over them but Harry quickly broke\nit.</p><p>\u201cSo, uh what are you doing tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, nothing really. Probably gonna head home and chill, you know\nFriday nights,\u201d she awkwardly laughed.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah! I was just wandering if you uh would like- like to come to\nmy place, we can like hangout a bit, watch a film or something,\u201d Harry stuttered.\nAnd after saying that he realized he must sound like a creepy killer. Who ask\nsomeone to go to their place just after meeting them!</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d she let out a chuckle. She was about to say something but\nHarry quickly cut her off.</p><p>\u201cLike, its totally fine if you don\u2019t want to. Like I get it, it was\npretty creepy to ask like that but I was think-\u201d he rambled but this time\nshe cut him off.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, calm down. I\u2019d love to go to your place,\u201d she laughed,\nshaking her head.</p><p>\u201cYou would?\u201d Harry was sure he looked like a boy on a Christmas\nmorning, but he couldn\u2019t help himself. She was the best present he could have.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cUm, okay. My house\u2019s across the street, just follow me?\u201d Harry\nasked looking down at her.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she nodded her head as she looked up at the traffic\nsignal, waiting for it to turn read.</p><p>\u201cI still didn\u2019t catch your name, though\u201d Harry said just the\nmoment the traffic light turned red again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Y/N,\u201d she chuckled looking down at her feet as she crossed\nthe road along side of Harry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Harry,\u201d he gave her a toothy grin.</p><p>\u201cI think I already know that.\u201d</p><p>It took them about 20 minutes to reach Harry\u2019s house and in those 20 minutes\nHarry got to know about Y/N\u2019s relationship status, what she did, what subject\nshe studied in uni, her family. Y/N even bought up those nudes he saw of her\nand told him she truly forgot about those and she was very sorry and\nembarrassed about that, which Harry replied with - \u2018well, you don\u2019t really have\nto be sorry, I kind of really liked them,\u2019 - making Y/N blush a crimson red and\nlook down at her feet. To which Harry had said she was very cute and pinched\nher cheek making her blush further.</p><p>\u201cAnd this is my house,\u201d Harry said when they reached the front of\nhis apartment.</p><p>\u201cIt is beautiful,\u201d Y/N said in awe as Harry typed in his code for\nthe door to open.</p><p>Harry guided Y/N through the front lawn to the front door. He unlocked the\ndoor for her and let her in and closed the door behind him.</p><p>Y/N slowly spun on her heels to get a overview of his house as Harry\nobserved her from behind.</p><p>\u201cYou really got a beautiful house,\u201d Y/N said facing him as Harry\ngave her a warm smile.</p><p>Harry wasn\u2019t sure what happened next, it happened all so fast. One moment\nY/N was standing there, three feet away from him and then she was aggressively\nkissing him while Harry tried to take them to his bedroom without breaking the\nkiss.</p><p>Harry didn\u2019t even know who went for the kiss first. He didn\u2019t know if it was\nhim or if it was her, maybe both of them together, but whoever it was, he was\nglad to be able to kiss her. It was really one of the best feelings in the\nworld. It was just too perfect. Harry felt like their lips were meant to for\neach other, he felt like they were meant for each other.</p><p>\u201cJump,\u201d Harry whispered into the kiss. Y/N without any hesitation\nobliged him and wrapped her legs around his torso.</p><p>Harry had one of his hand under her ass helping her to stay wrapped around\nhim and his other hand was busy getting rid of Y/N\u2019s backpack.</p><p>He quickly threw it away as he heard it land on the floor with a thud.</p><p>\u201cYou know, it has my phone in it?\u201d Y/N said, without breaking the\nkiss.</p><p>\u201cSorry, my love\u201d he really wasn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t care about that damn\nphone, he only cared about her.</p><p>If Harry was honest, it all felt like a dream. He felt like he was imagining\nher yet again, but with every second into the kiss he started to believe it was\nreally the reality. None of his imagination was that beautiful, none of those\nimaginations could\u2019ve been that beautiful. He knew, he really was kissing her\nand she really was in his arms.</p><p>Harry quickly took them up to his bedroom and threw Y/N on the bed but he\nmade sure she didn\u2019t get hurt.</p><p>\u201cGod, been thinking of doing this for so long,\u201d he quickly pulled\nhis hoodie over his head and smashed his lips back on hers. \u201cFor so\nfucking long.\u201d</p><p>Harry in one swift motion got rid of Y/N simple white T-shirt and then her\nripped jeans.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d Harry said as his eyes scanned Y/N\u2019s\nbody.</p><p>Harry couldn\u2019t count how many times he fantasized to do that; to see her\nlike that or to just have her in his company. He couldn\u2019t count how many time\nhe got himself off just by thinking it was her and just by thinking of her\ndripping pussy.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know for how long I wanted this,\u201d Harry whispered again\nand kissed her. However, this time it wasn\u2019t just aggressive, this time it was\nsoft too; it was passionate yet hungry; it was loving yet lustful. And Harry\ndidn\u2019t want it to end. He wanted to feel that way his whole life, he wanted to\nhave her in his whole life.</p><p>Harry slowly laid her on her back as he managed to unclasp her bra in the\nprocess. He threw it on the other side of the room as he continued to kiss her\nlips, then down to her jaw and then to her collarbones. He sucked at the corner\nof her collarbones just under her neck for a while longer as he realized it was\nher sweet spot. He pushed himself up as he looked down at the new mark he just\ncreated on her skin. He licked it again before his eyes travelled down to her\nheaving chest and then to her stomach.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d he whispered, more to himself as he went to kiss her\nagain. Harry\u2019s hand went to her right breast, squeezing it before pinching her\nnipple hard earning a moan from her.</p><p>One of Y/N\u2019s hand was on his hair as the other was on his chest. She threw\nher head to the side when Harry went down to suck on her another breast.</p><p>\u201cMmm, Harry,\u201d Y/N said breathily as she bought her hand down to\nhis crotch and squeezing it.</p><p>\u201cNot that fast,\u201d Harry tsked bringing both of her hands up to the\nheadboard. \u201cKeep them there,\u201d Harry said making Y/N whine but she\nkept them there nonetheless.</p><p>Harry went back to playing with her breasts as he made Y/N more and\nbreathless with every second.</p><p>\u201cYa\u2019 liking it?\u201d Harry said, biting on her nipple softly.</p><p>Y/N just moaned, not able to form any sort of words.</p><p>\u201cUse words, Y/N,\u201d her name rolling out of his tongue with so much\ndominance made her almost cum. She bucked her hips together and pushed herself\ntowards him but Harry quickly pushed her stomach down by his massive hand.</p><p>\u201cOh yes, Harry I like it so much!\u201d Y/N moaned.</p><p>\u201cYou like my mouth around your tits?\u201d Harry asked making a direct\neye contact with her while teasingly licking her nipples. And Y/N knew he loved\ndirty talks.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Y/N shuddered under him. She was loving and hating what he was\ndoing to her. She loved how he was teasing her but she also wanted him to fuck\nher and make her cum, not just tease her.</p><p>\u201cWhere else do you want my mouth to be, sweet girl?\u201d Harry said\nslowly caressing Y/N\u2019s cheek as he saw her getting redder under his touch.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d He stopped as he looked at her, smirking. \u201cYou won\u2019t\nget it, if you don\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pussy,\u201d she whispered, her voice almost inaudible.</p><p>\u201cYour what?\u201d His smirk grew bigger.</p><p>\u201cMy pussy!\u201d She screamed out in frustration. \u201cI want your\nmouth in my pussy.\u201d</p><p>Harry slowly drew his hand between her legs as he palmed her through panties\nmaking Y/N moan out loud and to push herself towards his hand, finally being\nable to release some of the pressure.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to eat your pretty little cunt?\u201d Harry asked as he\nstarted to rub her clit through her damp underwear.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Y/N moaned as Harry smirked further.</p><p>He slowly made his way between her legs and kissed her where she needed him\nthe most, ever slowly and teasingly. He looked up to see her reaction and sure\nenough Y/N had her back arched already.</p><p>He kissed her inner thighs, all the way up to her hip bone. He took the\nstring of her pink panty in between his teeth and slowly slid it down revealing\nher wet mess.</p><p>\u201cWho made you this wet, huh?\u201d He chuckled as he slowly ran his\nfinger up and down her slit.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Y/N moaned as Harry chuckled yet again. He slowly entered\nhis middle finger inside her making Y/N arch her back further and moan out his\nname.</p><p>Harry had started to pump her slowly, painfully slowly while kissing her in\nthe mouth and teasingly asking her if she wanted him to go faster. And, after\nmaking her scream out a &lsquo;yes, God Harry go faster, please\u2019 he finally did. He\nadded two more fingers as he went in and out of her.</p><p>\u201cYou like it?\u201d Harry asked as he licked on her nipple while\nfingering her.</p><p>\u201cYes, oh God yes Harry,\u201d she screamed as dug her nails in his\nback.</p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019m gonna cum,\u201d Y/N could feel her stomach clench.</p><p>\u201cI want you to cum for me Y/N,\u201d that was enough to push Y/N at the\nedge as she arched her back further, dug her nails further into his skin, as\nher eyes rolled back sending Y/N to a complete euphoria as she screamed out his\nname.</p><p>Y/N slumped down, but Harry kept his hand in her pussy rubbing her clit\nslowly making her jolt under his touch.</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019ll get what you wanted,\u201d Harry said as he made his way\nback to her heat.</p><p>He placed his hand either side of her thigh and bought her closure to his\nmouth.</p><p>Harry licked Y/N\u2019s whole slit clean. Harry finally got the answer he\u2019d been\nsearching from that very night of his concert. She tasted salty; and if Harry\ncould he would eat her as his meal for the rest of his life.</p><p>\u201cYou taste so fucking good,\u201d he said as he started to assault her\nclit with his tongue and within 10 minutes Y/N had her second orgasm.</p><p>\u201cTook you so long,\u201d Harry chuckled as he rubbed her clit slowly to\nhelp her come down from her high and when she was a little calm he marched his\nfingers inside her again making her cum for the third time, fourth time and\nthen fifth time.</p><p>\u201cHarry please stop,\u201d Y/N said weekly as a tear rolled down from\nher eyes and disappeared in to her hair line.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to stop,\u201d Harry said still not detaching his head\nfrom her very sensitive pussy.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Y/N whined but he didn\u2019t stop, he couldn\u2019t stop. He had\nbeen dreaming of doing that for so so long, 7 whole fucking months, he won\u2019t\nlet her go that easy.

He didn\u2019t know if he\nwas dreaming or if it was really the reality. He didn\u2019t know if the girl\nstanding across the street was really her or if he was hallucinating or if he\nwas just confusing her with someone else.</p><p>But, the girl had the same black hair -styled the same way, same tan skin,\nlips just as plump and eyes glistering the same way. However, he couldn\u2019t\nbelieve his eyes. Maybe he was dreaming again or maybe it was someone else. But\nhow could it be someone else, he was sure he knew every single feature of hers.\nFrom all the dreams and imaginations he was having from past 7 months, he was\ncertain he knew every inch of her. And the girl across the street- Harry was\nsure it was either her or it was just his imagination.</p><p>The traffic light turned red as everyone hurriedly crossed the road. Harry\nwas supposed to cross it too, but he didn\u2019t, he remained rooted to his spot as\nhe saw her cross the road. She was looking down at her feet not yet registering\nHarry\u2019s biddy eyes on her.</p><p>But, soon she did. Just after looking up, her eyes fell on him, as her lips\nparted just like the night he first saw her at the concert.</p><p>Harry smiled awkwardly as he waved.</p><p>It was really her!</p><p>It had been 7 months since that night and Harry had lost all hope to find\nher. At first he stopped himself for searching her, but when she started to\ntake over his mind and even resulted him in writing three songs about her,\nHarry was sure he needed to find her. It al started from Harry frantically\ncalling Jeff at 2 in the morning asking for the footage of that night and if he\nhad any idea who she was. Then getting in contact with the guard, David who had\nhanded her the camera, he even started to spend three hours, everyday on Instagram\njust in hope of finding her. But he didn\u2019t. He found that night\u2019s video in a\nlot of places but no one knew who that girl was and simply he concluded he\nmight never find her. However, there she was, after 7 months she was there,\nwalking towards him, looking like nothing but Aphrodite.</p><p>She waved back with a smile just as awkward</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Harry said stuffing both of his hand in his front pocket.\nHe was nervous. He was so fucking nervous. He didn\u2019t know what it was about her\nthat made his palm sweat and mind fuzzy. He never felt that way for a girl, a\ngirl never made him that nervous.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she replied shyly tucking a strand of her hair behind her\near.</p><p>And Harry felt like he\u2019d lose control. She was too beautiful, too innocent\nto be even real. How did she even manage to take those pictures, she was too\ninnocent for that.</p><p>\u201cNever saw you around here,\u201d Harry said trying his best to cover\nup his nervousness.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah, I - I usually drive, but my car decided to break down\nyesterday so yeah,\u201d she said pulling on the straps of her back pack.\n\u201cYou come here often?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, actually I always use this route\u2026.usually go to the park in\nthe evening for a run,\u201d Harry smiled.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d An awkward silence fell over them but Harry quickly broke\nit.</p><p>\u201cSo, uh what are you doing tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, nothing really. Probably gonna head home and chill, you know\nFriday nights,\u201d she awkwardly laughed.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah! I was just wandering if you uh would like- like to come to\nmy place, we can like hangout a bit, watch a film or something,\u201d Harry stuttered.\nAnd after saying that he realized he must sound like a creepy killer. Who ask\nsomeone to go to their place just after meeting them!</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d she let out a chuckle. She was about to say something but\nHarry quickly cut her off.</p><p>\u201cLike, its totally fine if you don\u2019t want to. Like I get it, it was\npretty creepy to ask like that but I was think-\u201d he rambled but this time\nshe cut him off.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, calm down. I\u2019d love to go to your place,\u201d she laughed,\nshaking her head.</p><p>\u201cYou would?\u201d Harry was sure he looked like a boy on a Christmas\nmorning, but he couldn\u2019t help himself. She was the best present he could have.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cUm, okay. My house\u2019s across the street, just follow me?\u201d Harry\nasked looking down at her.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she nodded her head as she looked up at the traffic\nsignal, waiting for it to turn read.</p><p>\u201cI still didn\u2019t catch your name, though\u201d Harry said just the\nmoment the traffic light turned red again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Y/N,\u201d she chuckled looking down at her feet as she crossed\nthe road along side of Harry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Harry,\u201d he gave her a toothy grin.</p><p>\u201cI think I already know that.\u201d</p><p>It took them about 20 minutes to reach Harry\u2019s house and in those 20 minutes\nHarry got to know about Y/N\u2019s relationship status, what she did, what subject\nshe studied in uni, her family. Y/N even bought up those nudes he saw of her\nand told him she truly forgot about those and she was very sorry and\nembarrassed about that, which Harry replied with - \u2018well, you don\u2019t really have\nto be sorry, I kind of really liked them,\u2019 - making Y/N blush a crimson red and\nlook down at her feet. To which Harry had said she was very cute and pinched\nher cheek making her blush further.</p><p>\u201cAnd this is my house,\u201d Harry said when they reached the front of\nhis apartment.</p><p>\u201cIt is beautiful,\u201d Y/N said in awe as Harry typed in his code for\nthe door to open.</p><p>Harry guided Y/N through the front lawn to the front door. He unlocked the\ndoor for her and let her in and closed the door behind him.</p><p>Y/N slowly spun on her heels to get a overview of his house as Harry\nobserved her from behind.</p><p>\u201cYou really got a beautiful house,\u201d Y/N said facing him as Harry\ngave her a warm smile.</p><p>Harry wasn\u2019t sure what happened next, it happened all so fast. One moment\nY/N was standing there, three feet away from him and then she was aggressively\nkissing him while Harry tried to take them to his bedroom without breaking the\nkiss.</p><p>Harry didn\u2019t even know who went for the kiss first. He didn\u2019t know if it was\nhim or if it was her, maybe both of them together, but whoever it was, he was\nglad to be able to kiss her. It was really one of the best feelings in the\nworld. It was just too perfect. Harry felt like their lips were meant to for\neach other, he felt like they were meant for each other.</p><p>\u201cJump,\u201d Harry whispered into the kiss. Y/N without any hesitation\nobliged him and wrapped her legs around his torso.</p><p>Harry had one of his hand under her ass helping her to stay wrapped around\nhim and his other hand was busy getting rid of Y/N\u2019s backpack.</p><p>He quickly threw it away as he heard it land on the floor with a thud.</p><p>\u201cYou know, it has my phone in it?\u201d Y/N said, without breaking the\nkiss.</p><p>\u201cSorry, my love\u201d he really wasn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t care about that damn\nphone, he only cared about her.</p><p>If Harry was honest, it all felt like a dream. He felt like he was imagining\nher yet again, but with every second into the kiss he started to believe it was\nreally the reality. None of his imagination was that beautiful, none of those\nimaginations could\u2019ve been that beautiful. He knew, he really was kissing her\nand she really was in his arms.</p><p>Harry quickly took them up to his bedroom and threw Y/N on the bed but he\nmade sure she didn\u2019t get hurt.</p><p>\u201cGod, been thinking of doing this for so long,\u201d he quickly pulled\nhis hoodie over his head and smashed his lips back on hers. \u201cFor so\nfucking long.\u201d</p><p>Harry in one swift motion got rid of Y/N simple white T-shirt and then her\nripped jeans.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d Harry said as his eyes scanned Y/N\u2019s\nbody.</p><p>Harry couldn\u2019t count how many times he fantasized to do that; to see her\nlike that or to just have her in his company. He couldn\u2019t count how many time\nhe got himself off just by thinking it was her and just by thinking of her\ndripping pussy.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know for how long I wanted this,\u201d Harry whispered again\nand kissed her. However, this time it wasn\u2019t just aggressive, this time it was\nsoft too; it was passionate yet hungry; it was loving yet lustful. And Harry\ndidn\u2019t want it to end. He wanted to feel that way his whole life, he wanted to\nhave her in his whole life.</p><p>Harry slowly laid her on her back as he managed to unclasp her bra in the\nprocess. He threw it on the other side of the room as he continued to kiss her\nlips, then down to her jaw and then to her collarbones. He sucked at the corner\nof her collarbones just under her neck for a while longer as he realized it was\nher sweet spot. He pushed himself up as he looked down at the new mark he just\ncreated on her skin. He licked it again before his eyes travelled down to her\nheaving chest and then to her stomach.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d he whispered, more to himself as he went to kiss her\nagain. Harry\u2019s hand went to her right breast, squeezing it before pinching her\nnipple hard earning a moan from her.</p><p>One of Y/N\u2019s hand was on his hair as the other was on his chest. She threw\nher head to the side when Harry went down to suck on her another breast.</p><p>\u201cMmm, Harry,\u201d Y/N said breathily as she bought her hand down to\nhis crotch and squeezing it.</p><p>\u201cNot that fast,\u201d Harry tsked bringing both of her hands up to the\nheadboard. \u201cKeep them there,\u201d Harry said making Y/N whine but she\nkept them there nonetheless.</p><p>Harry went back to playing with her breasts as he made Y/N more and\nbreathless with every second.</p><p>\u201cYa\u2019 liking it?\u201d Harry said, biting on her nipple softly.</p><p>Y/N just moaned, not able to form any sort of words.</p><p>\u201cUse words, Y/N,\u201d her name rolling out of his tongue with so much\ndominance made her almost cum. She bucked her hips together and pushed herself\ntowards him but Harry quickly pushed her stomach down by his massive hand.</p><p>\u201cOh yes, Harry I like it so much!\u201d Y/N moaned.</p><p>\u201cYou like my mouth around your tits?\u201d Harry asked making a direct\neye contact with her while teasingly licking her nipples. And Y/N knew he loved\ndirty talks.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Y/N shuddered under him. She was loving and hating what he was\ndoing to her. She loved how he was teasing her but she also wanted him to fuck\nher and make her cum, not just tease her.</p><p>\u201cWhere else do you want my mouth to be, sweet girl?\u201d Harry said\nslowly caressing Y/N\u2019s cheek as he saw her getting redder under his touch.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d He stopped as he looked at her, smirking. \u201cYou won\u2019t\nget it, if you don\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pussy,\u201d she whispered, her voice almost inaudible.</p><p>\u201cYour what?\u201d His smirk grew bigger.</p><p>\u201cMy pussy!\u201d She screamed out in frustration. \u201cI want your\nmouth in my pussy.\u201d</p><p>Harry slowly drew his hand between her legs as he palmed her through panties\nmaking Y/N moan out loud and to push herself towards his hand, finally being\nable to release some of the pressure.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to eat your pretty little cunt?\u201d Harry asked as he\nstarted to rub her clit through her damp underwear.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Y/N moaned as Harry smirked further.</p><p>He slowly made his way between her legs and kissed her where she needed him\nthe most, ever slowly and teasingly. He looked up to see her reaction and sure\nenough Y/N had her back arched already.</p><p>He kissed her inner thighs, all the way up to her hip bone. He took the\nstring of her pink panty in between his teeth and slowly slid it down revealing\nher wet mess.</p><p>\u201cWho made you this wet, huh?\u201d He chuckled as he slowly ran his\nfinger up and down her slit.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Y/N moaned as Harry chuckled yet again. He slowly entered\nhis middle finger inside her making Y/N arch her back further and moan out his\nname.</p><p>Harry had started to pump her slowly, painfully slowly while kissing her in\nthe mouth and teasingly asking her if she wanted him to go faster. And, after\nmaking her scream out a \u2018yes, God Harry go faster, please\u2019 he finally did. He\nadded two more fingers as he went in and out of her.</p><p>\u201cYou like it?\u201d Harry asked as he licked on her nipple while\nfingering her.</p><p>\u201cYes, oh God yes Harry,\u201d she screamed as dug her nails in his\nback.</p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019m gonna cum,\u201d Y/N could feel her stomach clench.</p><p>\u201cI want you to cum for me Y/N,\u201d that was enough to push Y/N at the\nedge as she arched her back further, dug her nails further into his skin, as\nher eyes rolled back sending Y/N to a complete euphoria as she screamed out his\nname.</p><p>Y/N slumped down, but Harry kept his hand in her pussy rubbing her clit\nslowly making her jolt under his touch.</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019ll get what you wanted,\u201d Harry said as he made his way\nback to her heat.</p><p>He placed his hand either side of her thigh and bought her closure to his\nmouth.</p><p>Harry licked Y/N\u2019s whole slit clean. Harry finally got the answer he\u2019d been\nsearching from that very night of his concert. She tasted salty; and if Harry\ncould he would eat her as his meal for the rest of his life.</p><p>\u201cYou taste so fucking good,\u201d he said as he started to assault her\nclit with his tongue and within 10 minutes Y/N had her second orgasm.</p><p>\u201cTook you so long,\u201d Harry chuckled as he rubbed her clit slowly to\nhelp her come down from her high and when she was a little calm he marched his\nfingers inside her again making her cum for the third time, fourth time and\nthen fifth time.</p><p>\u201cHarry please stop,\u201d Y/N said weekly as a tear rolled down from\nher eyes and disappeared in to her hair line.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to stop,\u201d Harry said still not detaching his head\nfrom her very sensitive pussy.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Y/N whined but he didn\u2019t stop, he couldn\u2019t stop. He had\nbeen dreaming of doing that for so so long, 7 whole fucking months, he won\u2019t\nlet her go that easy. After making him wakeup from his wet dreams and then\nmaking him spend the next half an hour trying to get himself off amd even after\ngetting himself off but still not getting the pleasure he needed so bad because\nthe only thing he wanted to do was eat her out and then fuck her to life.</p><p>No, he wasn\u2019t letting her go that easy.</p><p>Then it hit him, what if she really wanted him to stop. He didn\u2019t want to hurt\nher in any way possible.</p><p>\u201cHey, am I hurting you? Is it too much?\u201d Harry said looking up at\nher, concern evident in his voice.</p><p>\u201cUgh, no,\u201d she cried out as she bought his head back to her heated\nmess.</p><p>This made Harry chuckle as he started to flick her clit with his tongue\nagain.</p><p>\u201cOkay, use 'peaches\u2019 if it gets too much, yeah?\u201d Harry said after\na while.</p><p>Y/N just moaned just before came for the sixth time that night.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re ready for my cock, you want it?\u201d Harry said as he\nundid his pant zipper.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes Harry, please!\u201d Y/N said, her voice desperate. Y/N was\nworn out but she quickly marched towards his still covered cock.</p><p>Harry quickly pulled his pants down along with his boxer revealing his hard,\nthick nine inch cock.</p><p>\u201cYou want it in your mouth?\u201d Harry asked as Y/N tried to get a\nhold of him.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Y/N nodded her head eagerly.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he chuckled as he tapped his dick on her cheeks before placing\nit on her already open mouth.</p><p>Y/N firstly took only his red tip before she tried to take him whole.\nHowever, she couldn\u2019t reach every part of his, she just used her hands for\nthose parts.</p><p>Harry on the other hand just enjoyed what she made him feel and he very much\nenjoyed the view in front of him. Y/N bobbing her head up and down his\ndick\u2026.she just looked so innocent like that.</p><p>Harry bought her hair in a pony tail as she continued to deep throat him.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he pulled her back by her hair just before he came. He\nlaid her back down as he positioned himself between her legs.</p><p>He wanted to feel her clench around him.</p><p>\u201cHere, are you gonna be good and take my cock?\u201d Harry asked as he\nteased her entrance by running his cock up and down her slit.</p><p>Y/N nodded with antisipation just when she felt him enter.</p><p>At first he just let her adjust to him while kissing her neck and jaw softly\nbefore he slowly increased his pace.</p><p>Harry didnt know what he felt. It was like the funny feeling he felt on the\nstage which he dismissed right away. But then, he couldn\u2019t, it was just too\nstrong. He felt as if their souls were getting connected just like that night\nof the concert, he felt like their souls were becoming one just like their\nbody.</p><p>Harry didn\u2019t know what to make of it, he didn\u2019t know if he should believe it\nor not. He didn\u2019t know if it was true or not, but the feeling sure was\nbeautiful and he\u2019d do anything to feel like that forever.</p><p>Harry kissed her as he kept thrusting into her and soon Y/N came. And,\nfeeling her clench around him was enough to set him off. He quickly bought\nhimself out of her as his cum splattered on her stomach and spread all the way\nup to her chest then to her neck.</p><p>Harry took the cum on her neck with his finger before placing it between her\nlips to which Y/N quickly opened her mouth and licked his finger clean.</p><p>Harry leaned over her to place a tender soft kiss on her lips before he\ncrashed next to her on the mattress.</p><p>\u201cSo, there is this new restaurant that opened few days ago, I really\nwanna try it out. You think we can go there tomorrow?\u201d Harry asked\nbreathily.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to walk tomorrow, at all,\u201d Y/N\nturned to look at Harry as he let out a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cWell I have a better plan, it won\u2019t require any walking, ya\nknow?\u201d Harry said wrapping his arm around Y/N and pulling her closer to\nhim as he kissed her cheek. \u201cWe can watch Netflix all day and then order\nsome pizza and I have some ice cream in my fridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a nice day to me.\u201d Y/N flashed Harry a huge smile.</p><p>\u201cBy the way, have you seen 'Ice age\u2019 recently?\u201d Y/N asked after a\nwhile.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah\u2026\u201d Harry replied uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cExplains a lot.\u201d</p>",

He didn\u2019t know if he\nwas dreaming or if it was really the reality. He didn\u2019t know if the girl\nstanding across the street was really her or if he was hallucinating or if he\nwas just confusing her with someone else.</p><p>But, the girl had the same black hair -styled the same way, same tan skin,\nlips just as plump and eyes glistering the same way. However, he couldn\u2019t\nbelieve his eyes. Maybe he was dreaming again or maybe it was someone else. But\nhow could it be someone else, he was sure he knew every single feature of hers.\nFrom all the dreams and imaginations he was having from past 7 months, he was\ncertain he knew every inch of her. And the girl across the street- Harry was\nsure it was either her or it was just his imagination.</p><p>The traffic light turned red as everyone hurriedly crossed the road. Harry\nwas supposed to cross it too, but he didn\u2019t, he remained rooted to his spot as\nhe saw her cross the road. She was looking down at her feet not yet registering\nHarry\u2019s biddy eyes on her.</p><p>But, soon she did. Just after looking up, her eyes fell on him, as her lips\nparted just like the night he first saw her at the concert.</p><p>Harry smiled awkwardly as he waved.</p><p>It was really her!</p><p>It had been 7 months since that night and Harry had lost all hope to find\nher. At first he stopped himself for searching her, but when she started to\ntake over his mind and even resulted him in writing three songs about her,\nHarry was sure he needed to find her. It al started from Harry frantically\ncalling Jeff at 2 in the morning asking for the footage of that night and if he\nhad any idea who she was. Then getting in contact with the guard, David who had\nhanded her the camera, he even started to spend three hours, everyday on Instagram\njust in hope of finding her. But he didn\u2019t. He found that night\u2019s video in a\nlot of places but no one knew who that girl was and simply he concluded he\nmight never find her. However, there she was, after 7 months she was there,\nwalking towards him, looking like nothing but Aphrodite.</p><p>She waved back with a smile just as awkward</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Harry said stuffing both of his hand in his front pocket.\nHe was nervous. He was so fucking nervous. He didn\u2019t know what it was about her\nthat made his palm sweat and mind fuzzy. He never felt that way for a girl, a\ngirl never made him that nervous.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she replied shyly tucking a strand of her hair behind her\near.</p><p>And Harry felt like he\u2019d lose control. She was too beautiful, too innocent\nto be even real. How did she even manage to take those pictures, she was too\ninnocent for that.</p><p>\u201cNever saw you around here,\u201d Harry said trying his best to cover\nup his nervousness.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah, I - I usually drive, but my car decided to break down\nyesterday so yeah,\u201d she said pulling on the straps of her back pack.\n\u201cYou come here often?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, actually I always use this route\u2026.usually go to the park in\nthe evening for a run,\u201d Harry smiled.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d An awkward silence fell over them but Harry quickly broke\nit.</p><p>\u201cSo, uh what are you doing tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, nothing really. Probably gonna head home and chill, you know\nFriday nights,\u201d she awkwardly laughed.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah! I was just wandering if you uh would like- like to come to\nmy place, we can like hangout a bit, watch a film or something,\u201d Harry stuttered.\nAnd after saying that he realized he must sound like a creepy killer. Who ask\nsomeone to go to their place just after meeting them!</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d she let out a chuckle. She was about to say something but\nHarry quickly cut her off.</p><p>\u201cLike, its totally fine if you don\u2019t want to. Like I get it, it was\npretty creepy to ask like that but I was think-\u201d he rambled but this time\nshe cut him off.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, calm down. I\u2019d love to go to your place,\u201d she laughed,\nshaking her head.</p><p>\u201cYou would?\u201d Harry was sure he looked like a boy on a Christmas\nmorning, but he couldn\u2019t help himself. She was the best present he could have.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cUm, okay. My house\u2019s across the street, just follow me?\u201d Harry\nasked looking down at her.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she nodded her head as she looked up at the traffic\nsignal, waiting for it to turn read.</p><p>\u201cI still didn\u2019t catch your name, though\u201d Harry said just the\nmoment the traffic light turned red again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Y/N,\u201d she chuckled looking down at her feet as she crossed\nthe road along side of Harry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Harry,\u201d he gave her a toothy grin.</p><p>\u201cI think I already know that.\u201d</p><p>It took them about 20 minutes to reach Harry\u2019s house and in those 20 minutes\nHarry got to know about Y/N\u2019s relationship status, what she did, what subject\nshe studied in uni, her family. Y/N even bought up those nudes he saw of her\nand told him she truly forgot about those and she was very sorry and\nembarrassed about that, which Harry replied with - \u2018well, you don\u2019t really have\nto be sorry, I kind of really liked them,\u2019 - making Y/N blush a crimson red and\nlook down at her feet. To which Harry had said she was very cute and pinched\nher cheek making her blush further.</p><p>\u201cAnd this is my house,\u201d Harry said when they reached the front of\nhis apartment.</p><p>\u201cIt is beautiful,\u201d Y/N said in awe as Harry typed in his code for\nthe door to open.</p><p>Harry guided Y/N through the front lawn to the front door. He unlocked the\ndoor for her and let her in and closed the door behind him.</p><p>Y/N slowly spun on her heels to get a overview of his house as Harry\nobserved her from behind.</p><p>\u201cYou really got a beautiful house,\u201d Y/N said facing him as Harry\ngave her a warm smile.</p><p>Harry wasn\u2019t sure what happened next, it happened all so fast. One moment\nY/N was standing there, three feet away from him and then she was aggressively\nkissing him while Harry tried to take them to his bedroom without breaking the\nkiss.</p><p>Harry didn\u2019t even know who went for the kiss first. He didn\u2019t know if it was\nhim or if it was her, maybe both of them together, but whoever it was, he was\nglad to be able to kiss her. It was really one of the best feelings in the\nworld. It was just too perfect. Harry felt like their lips were meant to for\neach other, he felt like they were meant for each other.</p><p>\u201cJump,\u201d Harry whispered into the kiss. Y/N without any hesitation\nobliged him and wrapped her legs around his torso.</p><p>Harry had one of his hand under her ass helping her to stay wrapped around\nhim and his other hand was busy getting rid of Y/N\u2019s backpack.</p><p>He quickly threw it away as he heard it land on the floor with a thud.</p><p>\u201cYou know, it has my phone in it?\u201d Y/N said, without breaking the\nkiss.</p><p>\u201cSorry, my love\u201d he really wasn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t care about that damn\nphone, he only cared about her.</p><p>If Harry was honest, it all felt like a dream. He felt like he was imagining\nher yet again, but with every second into the kiss he started to believe it was\nreally the reality. None of his imagination was that beautiful, none of those\nimaginations could\u2019ve been that beautiful. He knew, he really was kissing her\nand she really was in his arms.</p><p>Harry quickly took them up to his bedroom and threw Y/N on the bed but he\nmade sure she didn\u2019t get hurt.</p><p>\u201cGod, been thinking of doing this for so long,\u201d he quickly pulled\nhis hoodie over his head and smashed his lips back on hers. \u201cFor so\nfucking long.\u201d</p><p>Harry in one swift motion got rid of Y/N simple white T-shirt and then her\nripped jeans.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d Harry said as his eyes scanned Y/N\u2019s\nbody.</p><p>Harry couldn\u2019t count how many times he fantasized to do that; to see her\nlike that or to just have her in his company. He couldn\u2019t count how many time\nhe got himself off just by thinking it was her and just by thinking of her\ndripping pussy.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know for how long I wanted this,\u201d Harry whispered again\nand kissed her. However, this time it wasn\u2019t just aggressive, this time it was\nsoft too; it was passionate yet hungry; it was loving yet lustful. And Harry\ndidn\u2019t want it to end. He wanted to feel that way his whole life, he wanted to\nhave her in his whole life.</p><p>Harry slowly laid her on her back as he managed to unclasp her bra in the\nprocess. He threw it on the other side of the room as he continued to kiss her\nlips, then down to her jaw and then to her collarbones. He sucked at the corner\nof her collarbones just under her neck for a while longer as he realized it was\nher sweet spot. He pushed himself up as he looked down at the new mark he just\ncreated on her skin. He licked it again before his eyes travelled down to her\nheaving chest and then to her stomach.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d he whispered, more to himself as he went to kiss her\nagain. Harry\u2019s hand went to her right breast, squeezing it before pinching her\nnipple hard earning a moan from her.</p><p>One of Y/N\u2019s hand was on his hair as the other was on his chest. She threw\nher head to the side when Harry went down to suck on her another breast.</p><p>\u201cMmm, Harry,\u201d Y/N said breathily as she bought her hand down to\nhis crotch and squeezing it.</p><p>\u201cNot that fast,\u201d Harry tsked bringing both of her hands up to the\nheadboard. \u201cKeep them there,\u201d Harry said making Y/N whine but she\nkept them there nonetheless.</p><p>Harry went back to playing with her breasts as he made Y/N more and\nbreathless with every second.</p><p>\u201cYa\u2019 liking it?\u201d Harry said, biting on her nipple softly.</p><p>Y/N just moaned, not able to form any sort of words.</p><p>\u201cUse words, Y/N,\u201d her name rolling out of his tongue with so much\ndominance made her almost cum. She bucked her hips together and pushed herself\ntowards him but Harry quickly pushed her stomach down by his massive hand.</p><p>\u201cOh yes, Harry I like it so much!\u201d Y/N moaned.</p><p>\u201cYou like my mouth around your tits?\u201d Harry asked making a direct\neye contact with her while teasingly licking her nipples. And Y/N knew he loved\ndirty talks.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Y/N shuddered under him. She was loving and hating what he was\ndoing to her. She loved how he was teasing her but she also wanted him to fuck\nher and make her cum, not just tease her.</p><p>\u201cWhere else do you want my mouth to be, sweet girl?\u201d Harry said\nslowly caressing Y/N\u2019s cheek as he saw her getting redder under his touch.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d He stopped as he looked at her, smirking. \u201cYou won\u2019t\nget it, if you don\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pussy,\u201d she whispered, her voice almost inaudible.</p><p>\u201cYour what?\u201d His smirk grew bigger.</p><p>\u201cMy pussy!\u201d She screamed out in frustration. \u201cI want your\nmouth in my pussy.\u201d</p><p>Harry slowly drew his hand between her legs as he palmed her through panties\nmaking Y/N moan out loud and to push herself towards his hand, finally being\nable to release some of the pressure.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to eat your pretty little cunt?\u201d Harry asked as he\nstarted to rub her clit through her damp underwear.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Y/N moaned as Harry smirked further.</p><p>He slowly made his way between her legs and kissed her where she needed him\nthe most, ever slowly and teasingly. He looked up to see her reaction and sure\nenough Y/N had her back arched already.</p><p>He kissed her inner thighs, all the way up to her hip bone. He took the\nstring of her pink panty in between his teeth and slowly slid it down revealing\nher wet mess.</p><p>\u201cWho made you this wet, huh?\u201d He chuckled as he slowly ran his\nfinger up and down her slit.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Y/N moaned as Harry chuckled yet again. He slowly entered\nhis middle finger inside her making Y/N arch her back further and moan out his\nname.</p><p>Harry had started to pump her slowly, painfully slowly while kissing her in\nthe mouth and teasingly asking her if she wanted him to go faster. And, after\nmaking her scream out a \u2018yes, God Harry go faster, please\u2019 he finally did. He\nadded two more fingers as he went in and out of her.</p><p>\u201cYou like it?\u201d Harry asked as he licked on her nipple while\nfingering her.</p><p>\u201cYes, oh God yes Harry,\u201d she screamed as dug her nails in his\nback.</p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019m gonna cum,\u201d Y/N could feel her stomach clench.</p><p>\u201cI want you to cum for me Y/N,\u201d that was enough to push Y/N at the\nedge as she arched her back further, dug her nails further into his skin, as\nher eyes rolled back sending Y/N to a complete euphoria as she screamed out his\nname.</p><p>Y/N slumped down, but Harry kept his hand in her pussy rubbing her clit\nslowly making her jolt under his touch.</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019ll get what you wanted,\u201d Harry said as he made his way\nback to her heat.</p><p>He placed his hand either side of her thigh and bought her closure to his\nmouth.</p><p>Harry licked Y/N\u2019s whole slit clean. Harry finally got the answer he\u2019d been\nsearching from that very night of his concert. She tasted salty; and if Harry\ncould he would eat her as his meal for the rest of his life.</p><p>\u201cYou taste so fucking good,\u201d he said as he started to assault her\nclit with his tongue and within 10 minutes Y/N had her second orgasm.</p><p>\u201cTook you so long,\u201d Harry chuckled as he rubbed her clit slowly to\nhelp her come down from her high and when she was a little calm he marched his\nfingers inside her again making her cum for the third time, fourth time and\nthen fifth time.</p><p>\u201cHarry please stop,\u201d Y/N said weekly as a tear rolled down from\nher eyes and disappeared in to her hair line.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to stop,\u201d Harry said still not detaching his head\nfrom her very sensitive pussy.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Y/N whined but he didn\u2019t stop, he couldn\u2019t stop. He had\nbeen dreaming of doing that for so so long, 7 whole fucking months, he won\u2019t\nlet her go that easy. After making him wakeup from his wet dreams and then\nmaking him spend the next half an hour trying to get himself off amd even after\ngetting himself off but still not getting the pleasure he needed so bad because\nthe only thing he wanted to do was eat her out and then fuck her to life.</p><p>No, he wasn\u2019t letting her go that easy.</p><p>Then it hit him, what if she really wanted him to stop. He didn\u2019t want to hurt\nher in any way possible.</p><p>\u201cHey, am I hurting you? Is it too much?\u201d Harry said looking up at\nher, concern evident in his voice.</p><p>\u201cUgh, no,\u201d she cried out as she bought his head back to her heated\nmess.</p><p>This made Harry chuckle as he started to flick her clit with his tongue\nagain.</p><p>\u201cOkay, use 'peaches\u2019 if it gets too much, yeah?\u201d Harry said after\na while.</p><p>Y/N just moaned just before came for the sixth time that night.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re ready for my cock, you want it?\u201d Harry said as he\nundid his pant zipper.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes Harry, please!\u201d Y/N said, her voice desperate. Y/N was\nworn out but she quickly marched towards his still covered cock.</p><p>Harry quickly pulled his pants down along with his boxer revealing his hard,\nthick nine inch cock.</p><p>\u201cYou want it in your mouth?\u201d Harry asked as Y/N tried to get a\nhold of him.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Y/N nodded her head eagerly.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he chuckled as he tapped his dick on her cheeks before placing\nit on her already open mouth.</p><p>Y/N firstly took only his red tip before she tried to take him whole.\nHowever, she couldn\u2019t reach every part of his, she just used her hands for\nthose parts.</p><p>Harry on the other hand just enjoyed what she made him feel and he very much\nenjoyed the view in front of him. Y/N bobbing her head up and down his\ndick\u2026.she just looked so innocent like that.</p><p>Harry bought her hair in a pony tail as she continued to deep throat him.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he pulled her back by her hair just before he came. He\nlaid her back down as he positioned himself between her legs.</p><p>He wanted to feel her clench around him.</p><p>\u201cHere, are you gonna be good and take my cock?\u201d Harry asked as he\nteased her entrance by running his cock up and down her slit.</p><p>Y/N nodded with antisipation just when she felt him enter.</p><p>At first he just let her adjust to him while kissing her neck and jaw softly\nbefore he slowly increased his pace.</p><p>Harry didnt know what he felt. It was like the funny feeling he felt on the\nstage which he dismissed right away. But then, he couldn\u2019t, it was just too\nstrong. He felt as if their souls were getting connected just like that night\nof the concert, he felt like their souls were becoming one just like their\nbody.</p><p>Harry didn\u2019t know what to make of it, he didn\u2019t know if he should believe it\nor not. He didn\u2019t know if it was true or not, but the feeling sure was\nbeautiful and he\u2019d do anything to feel like that forever.</p><p>Harry kissed her as he kept thrusting into her and soon Y/N came. And,\nfeeling her clench around him was enough to set him off. He quickly bought\nhimself out of her as his cum splattered on her stomach and spread all the way\nup to her chest then to her neck.</p><p>Harry took the cum on her neck with his finger before placing it between her\nlips to which Y/N quickly opened her mouth and licked his finger clean.</p><p>Harry leaned over her to place a tender soft kiss on her lips before he\ncrashed next to her on the mattress.</p><p>\u201cSo, there is this new restaurant that opened few days ago, I really\nwanna try it out. You think we can go there tomorrow?\u201d Harry asked\nbreathily.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to walk tomorrow, at all,\u201d Y/N\nturned to look at Harry as he let out a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cWell I have a better plan, it won\u2019t require any walking, ya\nknow?\u201d Harry said wrapping his arm around Y/N and pulling her closer to\nhim as he kissed her cheek. \u201cWe can watch Netflix all day and then order\nsome pizza and I have some ice cream in my fridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a nice day to me.\u201d Y/N flashed Harry a huge smile.</p><p>\u201cBy the way, have you seen 'Ice age\u2019 recently?\u201d Y/N asked after a\nwhile.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah\u2026\u201d Harry replied uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cExplains a lot.\u201d</p>",

At first he stopped himself for searching her, but when she started to\ntake over his mind and even resulted him in writing three songs about her,\nHarry was sure he needed to find her. It al started from Harry frantically\ncalling Jeff at 2 in the morning asking for the footage of that night and if he\nhad any idea who she was. Then getting in contact with the guard, David who had\nhanded her the camera, he even started to spend three hours, everyday on Instagram\njust in hope of finding her. But he didn&rsquo;t. He found that night&rsquo;s video in a\nlot of places but no one knew who that girl was and simply he concluded he\nmight never find her. However, there she was, after 7 months she was there,\nwalking towards him, looking like nothing but Aphrodite.</p><p>She waved back with a smile just as awkward</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Harry said stuffing both of his hand in his front pocket.\nHe was nervous. He was so fucking nervous. He didn&rsquo;t know what it was about her\nthat made his palm sweat and mind fuzzy. He never felt that way for a girl, a\ngirl never made him that nervous.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; she replied shyly tucking a strand of her hair behind her\near.</p><p>And Harry felt like he&rsquo;d lose control. She was too beautiful, too innocent\nto be even real. How did she even manage to take those pictures, she was too\ninnocent for that.</p><p>&ldquo;Never saw you around here,&rdquo; Harry said trying his best to cover\nup his nervousness.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, yeah, I - I usually drive, but my car decided to break down\nyesterday so yeah,&rdquo; she said pulling on the straps of her back pack.\n&ldquo;You come here often?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, actually I always use this route&hellip;.usually go to the park in\nthe evening for a run,&rdquo; Harry smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; An awkward silence fell over them but Harry quickly broke\nit.</p><p>&ldquo;So, uh what are you doing tonight?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um, nothing really. Probably gonna head home and chill, you know\nFriday nights,&rdquo; she awkwardly laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yeah! I was just wandering if you uh would like- like to come to\nmy place, we can like hangout a bit, watch a film or something,&rdquo; Harry stuttered.\nAnd after saying that he realized he must sound like a creepy killer. Who ask\nsomeone to go to their place just after meeting them!</p><p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; she let out a chuckle. She was about to say something but\nHarry quickly cut her off.</p><p>&ldquo;Like, its totally fine if you don&rsquo;t want to. Like I get it, it was\npretty creepy to ask like that but I was think-&rdquo; he rambled but this time\nshe cut him off.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, hey, calm down. I&rsquo;d love to go to your place,&rdquo; she laughed,\nshaking her head.</p><p>&ldquo;You would?&rdquo; Harry was sure he looked like a boy on a Christmas\nmorning, but he couldn&rsquo;t help himself. She was the best present he could have.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; She smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Um, okay. My house&rsquo;s across the street, just follow me?&rdquo; Harry\nasked looking down at her.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; she nodded her head as she looked up at the traffic\nsignal, waiting for it to turn read.</p><p>&ldquo;I still didn&rsquo;t catch your name, though&rdquo; Harry said just the\nmoment the traffic light turned red again.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Y/N,&rdquo; she chuckled looking down at her feet as she crossed\nthe road along side of Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Harry,&rdquo; he gave her a toothy grin.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I already know that.&rdquo;</p><p>It took them about 20 minutes to reach Harry&rsquo;s house and in those 20 minutes\nHarry got to know about Y/N&rsquo;s relationship status, what she did, what subject\nshe studied in uni, her family. Y/N even bought up those nudes he saw of her\nand told him she truly forgot about those and she was very sorry and\nembarrassed about that, which Harry replied with - &lsquo;well, you don&rsquo;t really have\nto be sorry, I kind of really liked them,&rsquo; - making Y/N blush a crimson red and\nlook down at her feet. To which Harry had said she was very cute and pinched\nher cheek making her blush further.</p><p>&ldquo;And this is my house,&rdquo; Harry said when they reached the front of\nhis apartment.</p><p>&ldquo;It is beautiful,&rdquo; Y/N said in awe as Harry typed in his code for\nthe door to open.</p><p>Harry guided Y/N through the front lawn to the front door. He unlocked the\ndoor for her and let her in and closed the door behind him.</p><p>Y/N slowly spun on her heels to get a overview of his house as Harry\nobserved her from behind.</p><p>&ldquo;You really got a beautiful house,&rdquo; Y/N said facing him as Harry\ngave her a warm smile.</p><p>Harry wasn&rsquo;t sure what happened next, it happened all so fast. One moment\nY/N was standing there, three feet away from him and then she was aggressively\nkissing him while Harry tried to take them to his bedroom without breaking the\nkiss.</p><p>Harry didn&rsquo;t even know who went for the kiss first. He didn&rsquo;t know if it was\nhim or if it was her, maybe both of them together, but whoever it was, he was\nglad to be able to kiss her. It was really one of the best feelings in the\nworld. It was just too perfect. Harry felt like their lips were meant to for\neach other, he felt like they were meant for each other.</p><p>&ldquo;Jump,&rdquo; Harry whispered into the kiss. Y/N without any hesitation\nobliged him and wrapped her legs around his torso.</p><p>Harry had one of his hand under her ass helping her to stay wrapped around\nhim and his other hand was busy getting rid of Y/N&rsquo;s backpack.</p><p>He quickly threw it away as he heard it land on the floor with a thud.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, it has my phone in it?&rdquo; Y/N said, without breaking the\nkiss.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, my love&rdquo; he really wasn&rsquo;t. He didn&rsquo;t care about that damn\nphone, he only cared about her.</p><p>If Harry was honest, it all felt like a dream. He felt like he was imagining\nher yet again, but with every second into the kiss he started to believe it was\nreally the reality. None of his imagination was that beautiful, none of those\nimaginations could&rsquo;ve been that beautiful. He knew, he really was kissing her\nand she really was in his arms.</p><p>Harry quickly took them up to his bedroom and threw Y/N on the bed but he\nmade sure she didn&rsquo;t get hurt.</p><p>&ldquo;God, been thinking of doing this for so long,&rdquo; he quickly pulled\nhis hoodie over his head and smashed his lips back on hers. &ldquo;For so\nfucking long.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry in one swift motion got rid of Y/N simple white T-shirt and then her\nripped jeans.</p><p>&ldquo;God, you&rsquo;re so beautiful,&rdquo; Harry said as his eyes scanned Y/N&rsquo;s\nbody.</p><p>Harry couldn&rsquo;t count how many times he fantasized to do that; to see her\nlike that or to just have her in his company. He couldn&rsquo;t count how many time\nhe got himself off just by thinking it was her and just by thinking of her\ndripping pussy.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know for how long I wanted this,&rdquo; Harry whispered again\nand kissed her. However, this time it wasn&rsquo;t just aggressive, this time it was\nsoft too; it was passionate yet hungry; it was loving yet lustful. And Harry\ndidn&rsquo;t want it to end. He wanted to feel that way his whole life, he wanted to\nhave her in his whole life.</p><p>Harry slowly laid her on her back as he managed to unclasp her bra in the\nprocess. He threw it on the other side of the room as he continued to kiss her\nlips, then down to her jaw and then to her collarbones. He sucked at the corner\nof her collarbones just under her neck for a while longer as he realized it was\nher sweet spot. He pushed himself up as he looked down at the new mark he just\ncreated on her skin. He licked it again before his eyes travelled down to her\nheaving chest and then to her stomach.</p><p>&ldquo;Beautiful,&rdquo; he whispered, more to himself as he went to kiss her\nagain. Harry&rsquo;s hand went to her right breast, squeezing it before pinching her\nnipple hard earning a moan from her.</p><p>One of Y/N&rsquo;s hand was on his hair as the other was on his chest. She threw\nher head to the side when Harry went down to suck on her another breast.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm, Harry,&rdquo; Y/N said breathily as she bought her hand down to\nhis crotch and squeezing it.</p><p>&ldquo;Not that fast,&rdquo; Harry tsked bringing both of her hands up to the\nheadboard. &ldquo;Keep them there,&rdquo; Harry said making Y/N whine but she\nkept them there nonetheless.</p><p>Harry went back to playing with her breasts as he made Y/N more and\nbreathless with every second.</p><p>&ldquo;Ya&rsquo; liking it?&rdquo; Harry said, biting on her nipple softly.</p><p>Y/N just moaned, not able to form any sort of words.</p><p>&ldquo;Use words, Y/N,&rdquo; her name rolling out of his tongue with so much\ndominance made her almost cum. She bucked her hips together and pushed herself\ntowards him but Harry quickly pushed her stomach down by his massive hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yes, Harry I like it so much!&rdquo; Y/N moaned.</p><p>&ldquo;You like my mouth around your tits?&rdquo; Harry asked making a direct\neye contact with her while teasingly licking her nipples. And Y/N knew he loved\ndirty talks.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Y/N shuddered under him. She was loving and hating what he was\ndoing to her. She loved how he was teasing her but she also wanted him to fuck\nher and make her cum, not just tease her.</p><p>&ldquo;Where else do you want my mouth to be, sweet girl?&rdquo; Harry said\nslowly caressing Y/N&rsquo;s cheek as he saw her getting redder under his touch.</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo; He stopped as he looked at her, smirking. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t\nget it, if you don&rsquo;t tell me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My pussy,&rdquo; she whispered, her voice almost inaudible.</p><p>&ldquo;Your what?&rdquo; His smirk grew bigger.</p><p>&ldquo;My pussy!&rdquo; She screamed out in frustration. &ldquo;I want your\nmouth in my pussy.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry slowly drew his hand between her legs as he palmed her through panties\nmaking Y/N moan out loud and to push herself towards his hand, finally being\nable to release some of the pressure.</p><p>&ldquo;You want me to eat your pretty little cunt?&rdquo; Harry asked as he\nstarted to rub her clit through her damp underwear.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Y/N moaned as Harry smirked further.</p><p>He slowly made his way between her legs and kissed her where she needed him\nthe most, ever slowly and teasingly. He looked up to see her reaction and sure\nenough Y/N had her back arched already.</p><p>He kissed her inner thighs, all the way up to her hip bone. He took the\nstring of her pink panty in between his teeth and slowly slid it down revealing\nher wet mess.</p><p>&ldquo;Who made you this wet, huh?&rdquo; He chuckled as he slowly ran his\nfinger up and down her slit.</p><p>&ldquo;You,&rdquo; Y/N moaned as Harry chuckled yet again. He slowly entered\nhis middle finger inside her making Y/N arch her back further and moan out his\nname.</p><p>Harry had started to pump her slowly, painfully slowly while kissing her in\nthe mouth and teasingly asking her if she wanted him to go faster. And, after\nmaking her scream out a &lsquo;yes, God Harry go faster, please&rsquo; he finally did. He\nadded two more fingers as he went in and out of her.</p><p>&ldquo;You like it?&rdquo; Harry asked as he licked on her nipple while\nfingering her.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, oh God yes Harry,&rdquo; she screamed as dug her nails in his\nback.</p><p>&ldquo;God, I&rsquo;m gonna cum,&rdquo; Y/N could feel her stomach clench.</p><p>&ldquo;I want you to cum for me Y/N,&rdquo; that was enough to push Y/N at the\nedge as she arched her back further, dug her nails further into his skin, as\nher eyes rolled back sending Y/N to a complete euphoria as she screamed out his\nname.</p><p>Y/N slumped down, but Harry kept his hand in her pussy rubbing her clit\nslowly making her jolt under his touch.</p><p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ll get what you wanted,&rdquo; Harry said as he made his way\nback to her heat.</p><p>He placed his hand either side of her thigh and bought her closure to his\nmouth.</p><p>Harry licked Y/N&rsquo;s whole slit clean. Harry finally got the answer he&rsquo;d been\nsearching from that very night of his concert. She tasted salty; and if Harry\ncould he would eat her as his meal for the rest of his life.</p><p>&ldquo;You taste so fucking good,&rdquo; he said as he started to assault her\nclit with his tongue and within 10 minutes Y/N had her second orgasm.</p><p>&ldquo;Took you so long,&rdquo; Harry chuckled as he rubbed her clit slowly to\nhelp her come down from her high and when she was a little calm he marched his\nfingers inside her again making her cum for the third time, fourth time and\nthen fifth time.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry please stop,&rdquo; Y/N said weekly as a tear rolled down from\nher eyes and disappeared in to her hair line.</p><p>&ldquo;You want me to stop,&rdquo; Harry said still not detaching his head\nfrom her very sensitive pussy.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Y/N whined but he didn&rsquo;t stop, he couldn&rsquo;t stop. He had\nbeen dreaming of doing that for so so long, 7 whole fucking months, he won&rsquo;t\nlet her go that easy. After making him wakeup from his wet dreams and then\nmaking him spend the next half an hour trying to get himself off amd even after\ngetting himself off but still not getting the pleasure he needed so bad because\nthe only thing he wanted to do was eat her out and then fuck her to life.</p><p>No, he wasn&rsquo;t letting her go that easy.</p><p>Then it hit him, what if she really wanted him to stop. He didn&rsquo;t want to hurt\nher in any way possible.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, am I hurting you? Is it too much?&rdquo; Harry said looking up at\nher, concern evident in his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh, no,&rdquo; she cried out as she bought his head back to her heated\nmess.</p><p>This made Harry chuckle as he started to flick her clit with his tongue\nagain.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, use 'peaches&rsquo; if it gets too much, yeah?&rdquo; Harry said after\na while.</p><p>Y/N just moaned just before came for the sixth time that night.</p><p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re ready for my cock, you want it?&rdquo; Harry said as he\nundid his pant zipper.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yes Harry, please!&rdquo; Y/N said, her voice desperate. Y/N was\nworn out but she quickly marched towards his still covered cock.</p><p>Harry quickly pulled his pants down along with his boxer revealing his hard,\nthick nine inch cock.</p><p>&ldquo;You want it in your mouth?&rdquo; Harry asked as Y/N tried to get a\nhold of him.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Y/N nodded her head eagerly.</p><p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he chuckled as he tapped his dick on her cheeks before placing\nit on her already open mouth.</p><p>Y/N firstly took only his red tip before she tried to take him whole.\nHowever, she couldn&rsquo;t reach every part of his, she just used her hands for\nthose parts.</p><p>Harry on the other hand just enjoyed what she made him feel and he very much\nenjoyed the view in front of him. Y/N bobbing her head up and down his\ndick&hellip;.she just looked so innocent like that.</p><p>Harry bought her hair in a pony tail as she continued to deep throat him.</p><p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he pulled her back by her hair just before he came. He\nlaid her back down as he positioned himself between her legs.</p><p>He wanted to feel her clench around him.</p><p>&ldquo;Here, are you gonna be good and take my cock?&rdquo; Harry asked as he\nteased her entrance by running his cock up and down her slit.</p><p>Y/N nodded with antisipation just when she felt him enter.</p><p>At first he just let her adjust to him while kissing her neck and jaw softly\nbefore he slowly increased his pace.</p><p>Harry didnt know what he felt. It was like the funny feeling he felt on the\nstage which he dismissed right away. But then, he couldn&rsquo;t, it was just too\nstrong. He felt as if their souls were getting connected just like that night\nof the concert, he felt like their souls were becoming one just like their\nbody.</p><p>Harry didn&rsquo;t know what to make of it, he didn&rsquo;t know if he should believe it\nor not. He didn&rsquo;t know if it was true or not, but the feeling sure was\nbeautiful and he&rsquo;d do anything to feel like that forever.</p><p>Harry kissed her as he kept thrusting into her and soon Y/N came. And,\nfeeling her clench around him was enough to set him off. He quickly bought\nhimself out of her as his cum splattered on her stomach and spread all the way\nup to her chest then to her neck.</p><p>Harry took the cum on her neck with his finger before placing it between her\nlips to which Y/N quickly opened her mouth and licked his finger clean.</p><p>Harry leaned over her to place a tender soft kiss on her lips before he\ncrashed next to her on the mattress.</p><p>&ldquo;So, there is this new restaurant that opened few days ago, I really\nwanna try it out. You think we can go there tomorrow?&rdquo; Harry asked\nbreathily.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be able to walk tomorrow, at all,&rdquo; Y/N\nturned to look at Harry as he let out a chuckle.</p><p>&ldquo;Well I have a better plan, it won&rsquo;t require any walking, ya\nknow?&rdquo; Harry said wrapping his arm around Y/N and pulling her closer to\nhim as he kissed her cheek. &ldquo;We can watch Netflix all day and then order\nsome pizza and I have some ice cream in my fridge.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sounds like a nice day to me.&rdquo; Y/N flashed Harry a huge smile.</p><p>&ldquo;By the way, have you seen 'Ice age&rsquo; recently?&rdquo; Y/N asked after a\nwhile.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, yeah&hellip;&rdquo; Harry replied uncertainly.</p><p>&ldquo;Explains a lot.&rdquo;</p>",
