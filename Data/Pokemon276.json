        "body": "<p>Den&rsquo;s weird dream theater time:</p><p>So the dream starts off weird. First off this is the pokemon world but it&rsquo;s also blended a bit with reality. My family has an Umbreon, Espeon, and some baby black fox kind of pokemon that we call Kitty (she&rsquo;s actually my old pomeranian I used to have). We live in this wooded, mountainous community where they warn us of some impending prophecy. Standard mystic babble, who cares</p><p>Except the sky opens up in the distance and a torrent of lava and weird, tribal/spartan soldiers appear. We all try to make our escape and obviously we don&rsquo;t all make it, including a few family members. Dad and my Aunt grab our nieces and one of the enemy guys torches our Umbreon alive. At this point we&rsquo;re just trying to escape now, and we drive away in horror as everything we know goes ablaze.</p><p>Cue somebody from the enemy side gone rogue. They tell us that these people are from the future and harbingers of an apocalypse that has torn their world. Supposedly it was the actions of one person that brought this, and apparently most of humanity has let blind rage substitute their reasoning and want to punish the past for ruining the future. Apparently they&rsquo;re also a bunch of dumbasses too, but I digress. Rogue ends up joining our party with a pokemon I understand to be some alternate form of Salazzle with magma wings, claws, and sharp teeth.</p><p>He warns us that the attacks on the past happen very much like the one on our town at precise times. This introduces a time limit we have to be in certain towns. It&rsquo;s pretty bad because my dad wants to leave at 11:15 even though the rogue guy says we should leave at 11:05. Lo and behold we&rsquo;re on the road again just barely avoiding another town destruction, my poor aunt having to ride in a side car for some reason. </p><p>We stop by another town and we can&rsquo;t get past this mountain area without something to move giant boulders, AKA strength. Dad has never been one for battles and my aunt hates pokemon except for poor Espeon, still mourning Umbreon. My older niece, 4, somehow has neglected to inform us that she smuggled her mom&rsquo;s Sylveon out, so we feed our mons and get searching through the town, because we have 2 hours to find and beat a gym leader for the badge and find the necessary HM.</p><p>We find a gym leader, and he&rsquo;s this guy I hate from school. He actually refuses to fight me because he&rsquo;s still pissy about a soda from 5 years ago. I&rsquo;m already pissed and just have Kitty use Ice Fang because I hate him and we&rsquo;re on a time limit. Cue full blown fight with his team and my Kitty, Espeon, Sylveon, and Rogue&rsquo;s Salazzle, plus a random water type Arcanine I had made IRL that somehow slipped in. He had a Mega Gyarados, Scizor, Charizard, an Alolan Golem, and some new pokemon that&rsquo;s like a diamond skin mountain lion that I inherently understood was fast and powerful as a fairy and steel type. </p><p>Once I beat him with my pokemon I start beating him with my fist just because he&rsquo;s that much of an ass. I tell him to give me the badge and HM, and he tells me that they no longer have HM&rsquo;s. He throws the badge at my face and leaves. My dad tries to give me a stern talking to and my niece keeps hugging my pokemon but Rogue is at a loss for words. We can&rsquo;t escape now without the HM. </p><p>My dad loads his revolver and says &ldquo;then let&rsquo;s stop runnin&rsquo;.&rdquo; Granted this man is 60, has rods in his back and legs, feeble as hell, and uses a cane even in the dream, and he wants to fight the apocalypse Spartans. My aunt is entirely against it but you know? I&rsquo;ve had it with these guys too, and we convince the rogue to help us. We give my aunt the keys and tell her to get the kids out another way, and we proceed to find a hill.</p><p>I carry my dad on my back and Rogue has his Salazzle at the ready. As soon as the portal in the sky opens, we all fly through it screaming while Kitty, on my shoulder, shoots out Ice Beams at falling Soldiers and my dad just shoots at them and takes a few out. </p><p>The dream ends on a cliff hanger in this metropolis atop an ocean of oil and under a completely blacked out sky, the city barely lit by the smoldering ashes and cinders around it. I&rsquo;m asthmatic and any smoke seriously messes with me, so I wake up coughing.</p><p>I just love how myself and my niece keep pokemon hidden, how dumb these Spartans are, how done with these guys my dad is towards the end, and also unironically this system and theming. No I don&rsquo;t necessarily want death and destruction in a future game but I mean? The time limit, realistic world and darker theming was neato. I also want to sprite out these mystery mons.</p>",

My family has an Umbreon, Espeon, and some baby black fox kind of pokemon that we call Kitty (she\u2019s actually my old pomeranian I used to have). We live in this wooded, mountainous community where they warn us of some impending prophecy. Standard mystic babble, who cares</p><p>Except the sky opens up in the distance and a torrent of lava and weird, tribal/spartan soldiers appear. We all try to make our escape and obviously we don\u2019t all make it, including a few family members. Dad and my Aunt grab our nieces and one of the enemy guys torches our Umbreon alive. At this point we\u2019re just trying to escape now, and we drive away in horror as everything we know goes ablaze.</p><p>Cue somebody from the enemy side gone rogue. They tell us that these people are from the future and harbingers of an apocalypse that has torn their world. Supposedly it was the actions of one person that brought this, and apparently most of humanity has let blind rage substitute their reasoning and want to punish the past for ruining the future. Apparently they\u2019re also a bunch of dumbasses too, but I digress. Rogue ends up joining our party with a pokemon I understand to be some alternate form of Salazzle with magma wings, claws, and sharp teeth.</p><p>He warns us that the attacks on the past happen very much like the one on our town at precise times. This introduces a time limit we have to be in certain towns. It\u2019s pretty bad because my dad wants to leave at 11:15 even though the rogue guy says we should leave at 11:05. Lo and behold we\u2019re on the road again just barely avoiding another town destruction, my poor aunt having to ride in a side car for some reason. </p><p>We stop by another town and we can\u2019t get past this mountain area without something to move giant boulders, AKA strength. Dad has never been one for battles and my aunt hates pokemon except for poor Espeon, still mourning Umbreon. My older niece, 4, somehow has neglected to inform us that she smuggled her mom\u2019s Sylveon out, so we feed our mons and get searching through the town, because we have 2 hours to find and beat a gym leader for the badge and find the necessary HM.</p><p>We find a gym leader, and he\u2019s this guy I hate from school. He actually refuses to fight me because he\u2019s still pissy about a soda from 5 years ago. I\u2019m already pissed and just have Kitty use Ice Fang because I hate him and we\u2019re on a time limit. Cue full blown fight with his team and my Kitty, Espeon, Sylveon, and Rogue\u2019s Salazzle, plus a random water type Arcanine I had made IRL that somehow slipped in. He had a Mega Gyarados, Scizor, Charizard, an Alolan Golem, and some new pokemon that\u2019s like a diamond skin mountain lion that I inherently understood was fast and powerful as a fairy and steel type. </p><p>Once I beat him with my pokemon I start beating him with my fist just because he\u2019s that much of an ass. I tell him to give me the badge and HM, and he tells me that they no longer have HM\u2019s. He throws the badge at my face and leaves. My dad tries to give me a stern talking to and my niece keeps hugging my pokemon but Rogue is at a loss for words. We can\u2019t escape now without the HM. </p><p>My dad loads his revolver and says \u201cthen let\u2019s stop runnin\u2019.\u201d Granted this man is 60, has rods in his back and legs, feeble as hell, and uses a cane even in the dream, and he wants to fight the apocalypse Spartans. My aunt is entirely against it but you know? I\u2019ve had it with these guys too, and we convince the rogue to help us. We give my aunt the keys and tell her to get the kids out another way, and we proceed to find a hill.</p><p>I carry my dad on my back and Rogue has his Salazzle at the ready. As soon as the portal in the sky opens, we all fly through it screaming while Kitty, on my shoulder, shoots out Ice Beams at falling Soldiers and my dad just shoots at them and takes a few out. </p><p>The dream ends on a cliff hanger in this metropolis atop an ocean of oil and under a completely blacked out sky, the city barely lit by the smoldering ashes and cinders around it. I\u2019m asthmatic and any smoke seriously messes with me, so I wake up coughing.</p><p>I just love how myself and my niece keep pokemon hidden, how dumb these Spartans are, how done with these guys my dad is towards the end, and also unironically this system and theming. No I don\u2019t necessarily want death and destruction in a future game but I mean? The time limit, realistic world and darker theming was neato. I also want to sprite out these mystery mons.</p>",

Back in 1995, when I saw my first UPM (Unindexed Pocket Monster), I found out very quickly that other people thought you were totally crazy if you said you saw such things. The world has changed quite a bit since then when I was a child. In fact, in late 1997, a poll taken in Kanto shows that for the first time ever, more than fifty percent of residents now believe in Pok\u00e9GODS's. Since then, there have been polls that put the figure at over eighty percent or more.",
