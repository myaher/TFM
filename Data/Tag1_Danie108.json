You know one that won\u2019t let him take 3 whole months off so he can do nothing. I\u2019m not hating on him but these youtubers don\u2019t know how easy they have it. They should try working a real job and then let\u2019s see how much they want to complain about how hard it is to sit in front of a camera and play video games or talk about memes and get a ton of money for it.",
        "answer": "<p>I agree with this statement regarding YouTubers. I think it\u2019s probably not so cut and dry and easy for Dan to just determine what he wants from YouTube going forward because it involves making a lot of big decisions that will effect himself and others, but generally when YouTubers whine about their jobs or try to get their audience to pity them (not saying this is what Dan\u2019s doing), especially when they do it while pedaling merch, it make me roll my eyes. I have an irl friend who is pretty successful in the entertainment industry and they don\u2019t just get long periods of time off or have the flexibility that YouTubers do. Like the rest of us, that person has to meet deadlines and balance multiple projects continuously. All the jobs I have had have involved even less flexibility. It concerns me when some of them seem to take advantage of their young audiences and make them feel like they need to be spending their parents money or their favorites will be poor, when those same favorites are probably making more than their parents. I think the whole parasocial relationship aspect of YouTube is really interesting, but also really dangerous as there can be a big imbalance of power. If Dan started trying to get his audience to pity him or, for example, put membership on his channel while not offering regular content, I would stop supporting him immediately, but to be honest, I think most of the unhealthy attitudes I see come from the phandom itself and members policing other members. </p>",

        "question": "Is Dan your favorite youtuber?",
        "answer": "<p>Hmmm I guess he probably is, but mostly because of his past work. His videos are the ones I tend to go back to when I need cheering up or want a laugh, especially his older ones. I also have an attachment to him as a person, which is why I am interested in what he does next, whether it is YouTube or not. Out of all the YouTubers I have watched over the years, he is probably the one I have followed for the longest, even though I was very casual about it for the majority of the time. I don\u2019t really follow a lot of vloggers to be honest, so he is an exception. </p><p>The way YouTube is now doesn\u2019t really appeal to me that much. I used to watch Zoella a lot because she has identical coloring to me and her makeup reviews and looks were very wearable and relevant to me, but I could never see myself watching someone like James Charles. I gave him a chance when he had Jenna on and I just found him immature and his skill seems to be more in changing the way people look to look like some sort of trendy ideal, rather than in accentuating natural beauty. I also don\u2019t really like commentary vloggers. They usually just don\u2019t seem to have anything special to say or any expertise. For example, I watched that PsychIRL video on the phandom and, while there are a lot of interesting psychological factors at work here, the video just seemed sloppily made and didn\u2019t touch on any of them. Is she supposed to have a background in psychology? I would guess not based on her content. So why should anyone listen to her?</p><p>The one place that Dan loses a lot of points for me as compared to other YouTubers I watch is in the trust category. I don\u2019t really need to trust him to watch his comedy sketches, so that\u2019s fine, but he isn\u2019t the person I would turn to if I wanted an honest opinion. I also don\u2019t assume the person I\u2019m watching is the \u201creal\u201d Dan. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s playing a completely different person, but he has a very specific persona that is targeted at a certain demographic and he and Phil place a heavy focus on marketing merch and other products (Phil moreso, but Dan does it too), as opposed to someone like Jenna Marbles, who is extraordinary ethical when it comes to her audience and values her integrity as an entertainer above making money. I think she\u2019s an exception, so this isn\u2019t me throwing shade, but I personally appreciate it and respect her for it. I think the reason Dan\u2019s rebranding continues to fail is because he wants to be seen as the adult he is, but he constantly panders to a certain demographic and doesn\u2019t SHOW people that he is an adult who has changed.</p><p>Along those lines, while I think Dan is smart, I find myself less impressed with his newest videos because I think he tries hard to be profound, but also tries to refrain from truly giving an opinion or saying anything that might be the least bit controversial and I don\u2019t think those two things are compatible. I think a lot of his earlier videos had unintentionally profound moments because they were about the absurdity of everyday life. However, when he tries to get deeper and more philosophical or political, his musings tend to be very watered-down mainstream popular ideas, which can come off a bit disingenuous and cliche, like Eat Pray Love. In contrast, I watch Felix\u2019s Pew News frequently. I don\u2019t always agree with him and sometimes I think he is downright ignorant on some of the issues he talks about (in that he has a very specific set of experiences he is limited by), but he uses his expertise in media and makes strong clear points, so whether or not I agree, it doesn\u2019t matter, because they always tend to make me think and give me something to consider. </p><p>Basically I watch different YouTubers for different things, but I\u2019m not convinced the parasocial relationship aspect is very healthy so I try to remain detached from all of them. I would say Dan is probably my favorite for his content, although I admire Jenna the most, and probably would not start watching him if I didn\u2019t already know him because of his lack of consistency. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve come across a channel that I really like though, as you can probably tell from the fact that all the examples I mentioned are old YouTubers (even though they aren\u2019t the only people I watch), so I welcome any recommendations. Otherwise, I will just be over here looking forward to Dan\u2019s return or Game of Thrones, whichever comes first.</p>",

It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve come across a channel that I really like though, as you can probably tell from the fact that all the examples I mentioned are old YouTubers (even though they aren\u2019t the only people I watch), so I welcome any recommendations. Otherwise, I will just be over here looking forward to Dan\u2019s return or Game of Thrones, whichever comes first.</p>",
                "content": "<p>Hmmm I guess he probably is, but mostly because of his past work. His videos are the ones I tend to go back to when I need cheering up or want a laugh, especially his older ones. I also have an attachment to him as a person, which is why I am interested in what he does next, whether it is YouTube or not. Out of all the YouTubers I have watched over the years, he is probably the one I have followed for the longest, even though I was very casual about it for the majority of the time. I don&rsquo;t really follow a lot of vloggers to be honest, so he is an exception. </p><p>The way YouTube is now doesn&rsquo;t really appeal to me that much. I used to watch Zoella a lot because she has identical coloring to me and her makeup reviews and looks were very wearable and relevant to me, but I could never see myself watching someone like James Charles. I gave him a chance when he had Jenna on and I just found him immature and his skill seems to be more in changing the way people look to look like some sort of trendy ideal, rather than in accentuating natural beauty. I also don&rsquo;t really like commentary vloggers. They usually just don&rsquo;t seem to have anything special to say or any expertise. For example, I watched that PsychIRL video on the phandom and, while there are a lot of interesting psychological factors at work here, the video just seemed sloppily made and didn&rsquo;t touch on any of them. Is she supposed to have a background in psychology? I would guess not based on her content. So why should anyone listen to her?</p><p>The one place that Dan loses a lot of points for me as compared to other YouTubers I watch is in the trust category. I don&rsquo;t really need to trust him to watch his comedy sketches, so that&rsquo;s fine, but he isn&rsquo;t the person I would turn to if I wanted an honest opinion. I also don&rsquo;t assume the person I&rsquo;m watching is the &ldquo;real&rdquo; Dan. I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s playing a completely different person, but he has a very specific persona that is targeted at a certain demographic and he and Phil place a heavy focus on marketing merch and other products (Phil moreso, but Dan does it too), as opposed to someone like Jenna Marbles, who is extraordinary ethical when it comes to her audience and values her integrity as an entertainer above making money. I think she&rsquo;s an exception, so this isn&rsquo;t me throwing shade, but I personally appreciate it and respect her for it. I think the reason Dan&rsquo;s rebranding continues to fail is because he wants to be seen as the adult he is, but he constantly panders to a certain demographic and doesn&rsquo;t SHOW people that he is an adult who has changed.</p><p>Along those lines, while I think Dan is smart, I find myself less impressed with his newest videos because I think he tries hard to be profound, but also tries to refrain from truly giving an opinion or saying anything that might be the least bit controversial and I don&rsquo;t think those two things are compatible. I think a lot of his earlier videos had unintentionally profound moments because they were about the absurdity of everyday life. However, when he tries to get deeper and more philosophical or political, his musings tend to be very watered-down mainstream popular ideas, which can come off a bit disingenuous and cliche, like Eat Pray Love. In contrast, I watch Felix&rsquo;s Pew News frequently. I don&rsquo;t always agree with him and sometimes I think he is downright ignorant on some of the issues he talks about (in that he has a very specific set of experiences he is limited by), but he uses his expertise in media and makes strong clear points, so whether or not I agree, it doesn&rsquo;t matter, because they always tend to make me think and give me something to consider. </p><p>Basically I watch different YouTubers for different things, but I&rsquo;m not convinced the parasocial relationship aspect is very healthy so I try to remain detached from all of them.
