We had the perfect view of the beach.<br/></p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;As if your mum booked us the best room after hers,&ldquo; Brie said from behind me, and I turned to see her looking in the mini fridge. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Gotta let everyone know her daughter is well looked after,&rdquo; I muttered, before dropping myself on the queen-sized. I glared at the ceiling. &ldquo;Damn that softness.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie laughed before dropping herself beside me, leaning on her elbows. She grinned down at me. &ldquo;You know, I saw an arcade on the way up here. And we technically don&rsquo;t have anything to do until tomorrow.&rdquo; </p><!-- more --><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled. &ldquo;I saw it, too, you child.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She gave me a knowing look. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t act like you don&rsquo;t want to go down there.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I rolled my eyes. &ldquo;Of course I do. C'mon.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She laughed and the two of us left our suitcases, deciding to head straight down to the arcade room. We walked in and saw it was huge. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting anything less from a five star hotel in Hawaii to be honest. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Best part about all of this is that it&rsquo;s free,&ldquo; I said to Brie, before grabbing her hand and dragging her to the first game I saw \u2013 a retro racing game. &quot;I&rsquo;ll go first and I challenge you to try and beat me.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;A whole beach and we&rsquo;re in here playing arcade games,&ldquo; Brie said, shaking her with amusement. &quot;You&rsquo;re on, Y/L/N.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I grinned before leaning over the console, using the buttons to control the car onscreen. I felt Brie behind me, leaning her head on my shoulder and watching closely which made me smile. When the game ended and I came in third place, I gave her a teasing smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Your go,&ldquo; I said, stepping to the side. &quot;Good luck.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Won&rsquo;t need it,&ldquo; she said, grinning as she had her go. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I stood behind her, watching as she had her go. I hugged her from behind, leaning my head on her shoulder as I watched carefully. She was nearing second place and I grew nervous. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You should have picked a different game because I&rsquo;m totally about to kick your butt,&rdquo; she said with a smirk, her eyes glued to the screen. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Game isn&rsquo;t over yet,&ldquo; I mumbled, watching the map in the corner. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Laughter flew from her lips as she crossed the finish line, coming in first place. I let go of her waist and she turned around, grinning down at me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You were saying?&rdquo; she teased with a raised eyebrow. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I couldn&rsquo;t stop myself from smiling, despite the fact that she&rsquo;d won. She looked so cute and her happiness was contagious. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Y/N? Is that you?&ldquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A voice pulled us from our friendly competition and my smile faded when I turned and saw one of my mum&rsquo;s colleagues approaching us. She had her kid following behind, his eyes glued to his phone as if he&rsquo;d rather be anywhere else but here. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Mrs. Carter,&rdquo; I greeted with a forced smile. &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s me.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Wow, you&rsquo;ve grown up!&ldquo; she said in what I think was a nice voice. She looked me up and down before seeing Brie stood next to me. &quot;And this must be your girlfriend! Your mum mentioned.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie glanced at me before smiling politely at Mrs. Carter. &ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Brie.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Great to meet you, Brie,&ldquo; Mrs. Carter said, a smile on her face. She looked between us both before adding, &quot;What a lovely couple you both make.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I felt my cheeks growing warm. &ldquo;Erm, thanks, Mrs. Carter.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;This is my son, Harry,&ldquo; she said, before stepping to the side to reveal her young son, playing a game on his phone. &quot;He wanted to play in the arcade so here we are!&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I nodded, smiling awkwardly. &ldquo;Lovely.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Harry, say hi, don&rsquo;t be rude,&ldquo; she urged her son to speak, and when he didn&rsquo;t listen, she grabbed his phone from his grasp, making me stifle a chuckle. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie snickered behind me, only fuelling my laughter. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Mum!&rdquo; Harry whined, before looking at us. When he saw Brie, his eyes widened. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re that girl!&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;The new superhero! They announced it on Marvel&rsquo;s instagram!&ldquo; he continued, excited now. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Captain Marvel,&rdquo; I filled in for him, to which he nodded enthusiastically. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Yeah! Captain Marvel!&ldquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie laughed. &quot;Yeah, that&rsquo;s me, Harry. Do you want a photo?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He nodded, starstruck at the sight of Brie. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;That okay with you?&ldquo; she asked Mrs. Carter, who seemed glad that her son was talking to actual people. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She nodded, smiling. &quot;Of course.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I watched as Brie kneeled down and took a selfie with Harry. I sometimes forgot that Brie was becoming a bigger and bigger star every day, especially now that she was going to be apart of the Marvel universe. It was hard to remember when she was always my best friend, not this fancy Oscar-winning actress. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Right, well we should be going now,&ldquo; Mrs. Carter said after their photo. She looked to me, winking playfully. &quot;You bagged a good one here, Y/N.&rdquo; She looked to Brie. &ldquo;Great to meet you, Brie. I&rsquo;ll see you girls tomorrow at the party!&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We both waved goodbye as she left the arcade room, eventually being left alone. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Cute kid, funny mum,&ldquo; Brie commented, and I looked to her before we both started to laugh. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;One of my mum&rsquo;s colleagues down, ten million more to go,&rdquo; I said, rolling my eyes playfully. &ldquo;Thanks again for being here.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Anything for my girlfriend,&ldquo; she joked, wrapping an arm around my shoulders and leading me to the next game \u2013 basketball. &quot;New challenge?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I grinned. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re on.&rdquo; </p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0First day in Hawaii wasn&rsquo;t so bad and that was because I forgot, for a moment, why I was there in the first place. Brie and I had fun in the arcade, hung out in the hot tub and went for a walk on the beach. She ended up going to the gym that evening, since she promised her trainer she&rsquo;d keep on top of everything whilst out here, but when she came back, we went for dinner at the hotel&rsquo;s restaurant and then headed to bed. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Today, however, was the first day of many that I was dreading. My mum&rsquo;s engagement party. It was an outdoor party, in a lovely courtyard by the beach and I admittedly fell in love with the decorations and layout. But then I saw the guests and was reminded of the mingling. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You see your mum?&ldquo; Brie asked from beside me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I looked around and spotted my mum by the buffet table, standing with Isaac and talking to some guests. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Over there,&rdquo; I said, nodding in her direction, before looking to Brie. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She looked <i>really </i>good, I must admit. She was wearing a light blue pantsuit, a belt wrapped around her waist, accentuating her figure. Her short blonde hair was left out and she had minimal makeup on, but she didn&rsquo;t really need it. Yeah, definitely a superstar. A beautiful one at that. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You wanna say hi?&ldquo; she asked, meeting my eyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I shook my head, not yet ready to face my mum and her probable snarky comments about what a failure I was. &quot;I&rsquo;m good.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She cracked a smile. &ldquo;Okay, how about this. I go and get a drink, greet them, say you&rsquo;re in the toilet or something, and you can say hi later. That way we aren&rsquo;t being rude by not going over there at all.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled. &ldquo;This. This is why I love you.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She laughed and squeezed my hand gently before letting go and walking over there. I busied myself by turning around and pulling out my phone. It didn&rsquo;t last long though, because I felt a presence before me. When I looked up, I resisted the urge to roll my eyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Look who it is - our favourite cousin!&ldquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I&rsquo;m your only cousin,&rdquo; I pointed out to Naomi, one of two of my annoying cousins. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Hence our favourite!&ldquo; Naomi grinned, and I groaned inwardly. &quot;Long time, no see, Y/N.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Could have been longer,&ldquo; I mumbled.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;It&rsquo;s amazing how we&rsquo;re all back together after so long,&rdquo; Naomi commented, before glancing at her brother. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, Kieran?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kieran nodded. &ldquo;Definitely. You still doing that whole counselling thing, Y/N?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Yeah,&ldquo; I answered with a bored voice. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Too much work involved to just be a doctor, I assume,&rdquo; he said, before snickering with his sister. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I rolled my eyes and chose not to say anything. They weren&rsquo;t worth it and if I didn&rsquo;t let them get to me, they wouldn&rsquo;t win, right? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Little birdy told us that you brought someone with you this week,&ldquo; Naomi said, smiling deviously at me. &quot;Some actress?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;The hot blonde from that Kong: Skull Island film, I heard,&ldquo; Kieran added with a smirk. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;She&rsquo;s got a name,&rdquo; I snapped, glaring at Kieran. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Brie, not &lsquo;the hot blonde&rsquo;. And I&rsquo;d appreciate it if you didn&rsquo;t refer to her as that.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Woah, someone&rsquo;s defensive!&ldquo; Naomi laughed, nudging her brother. &quot;Better back off, Kieran. It sounds serious.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I see you both haven&rsquo;t changed,&ldquo; I said harshly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Oh, but you have,&rdquo; Naomi said, glaring down at me with a devilish smile on her lips, &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t you, Y/N? Rubbing shoulders with celebrities now.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I scoffed, crossing my arms. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Where is she, anyway?&ldquo; Kieran asked, quirking an eyebrow. &quot;You make her up?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;What, like you made up that marriage two years ago?&ldquo; I retorted, staring at him.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His smirk faded into an angry frown. &quot;That wasn&rsquo;t made up \u2013 she wanted a divorce as soon as it happened. It was a rough time.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I suppressed a smile. &ldquo;Riiiiiight.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Listen, you little\u2013&quot;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Babe, there you are!&ldquo; Brie&rsquo;s voice cut off Naomi, and I felt an arm lace around my waist before feeling a kiss on my cheek, quite close to the corner of my lips which made me feel warm inside. I turned and saw Brie smiling by my side. Saved by the bell, I guess. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Hey,&rdquo; I said, returning the smile, also trying not to laugh at Naomi&rsquo;s change in expression. &ldquo;Brie, these are my cousins. Naomi and Kieran.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I watched as Naomi and Kieran forced smiles on their faces and greeted Brie. I almost wanted to take a picture of this moment because it was too good. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;This is my girlfriend, Brie,&ldquo; I introduced her to them, giving them a knowing grin. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They didn&rsquo;t know what to say and I glanced at Brie, only to see her suppressing a laugh. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Nice meeting you, Brie, but my brother and I should get going,&rdquo; Naomi said as politely as she could muster. &ldquo;Bye.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie waved with a grin on her lips, and when they both disappeared, I breathed out in relief before giving Brie a hug. She was surprised, but laughed and returned the hug. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;What was that for?&ldquo; she asked when I pulled away, a smile on her lips and a sparkle in her eyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Coming in when you did,&rdquo; I said, not quite letting go of her arms just yet. &ldquo;Naomi was about to bite my head off.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She rolled her eyes playfully. &ldquo;Typical Y/N. I leave you alone for two minutes.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I chuckled. &ldquo;Seriously, though. One conversation with them and I already want to kill them. I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re here with me.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Anytime,&ldquo; she said, giving me a knowing look. &quot;You&rsquo;ve got this.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I sighed, glancing around, looking at everyone we&rsquo;d have to greet otherwise my mum would kill me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Yeah, I think I do,&ldquo; I said, nodding. &quot;Just don&rsquo;t leave me alone again please.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She laughed and intertwined our fingers, gently rocking our hands between us. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t, Y/N. I promise.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We walked a little, a silence settling between us, before I blurted out, &ldquo;You look really nice by the way.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie smiled, but her cheeks flushed a little. &ldquo;Thanks&hellip; so do you. I was going to tell you earlier, but you were having a mental breakdown, so&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I breathed out, suppressing a smile. &ldquo;Sounds about right. But thanks.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I looked to her and saw her smiling to herself, only making me smile, too. I realised I quite liked the feeling of her hand in mine. </p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;&hellip;and I want to thank you all for being here to celebrate with us this week,&ldquo; Isaac said, grinning at everybody in the marquee set up for the lunch. &quot;Y/M/N and I couldn&rsquo;t be any more happier to celebrate with all of our friends and family.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everybody began to clap and cheer for the engaged couple, making Isaac pause momentarily. Brie and I joined in with the clapping, and admittedly, I smiled at Isaac and my mum, happy that they were happy. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Now, speaking of family, I know speeches are for the wedding reception, but I wanted to say something quick,&ldquo; he continued when the clapping came to a stop. His eyes fell on me, myself sat opposite him on the lead table. &quot;Y/N, I wanted to thank you for always being so supportive of your mother and I&rsquo;s relationship. It&rsquo;s very reassuring to know I have your approval and I&rsquo;m glad I can eventually call you my step-daughter. Thank you.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled awkwardly, not appreciating the attention of everyone in the room on me right now. People clapped and some began to chant &ldquo;speech! speech!&rdquo; making me widen my eyes. Hell to the no. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You want to make a speech?&ldquo; Isaac asked, a hopeful glint in his eyes as he held out the microphone. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Er&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Go on, Y/N, you got this,&ldquo; Brie encouraged, grinning beside me, before grabbing my hand and squeezing gently. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Not really having a choice, I stood up and accepted the microphone, watching as Isaac took his seat and everybody went quiet. All eyes were on me and I felt Brie letting go of my hand, but I pulled it back, intertwining our fingers. Moral support was good right now, and she made me feel a lot better. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Erm, well, as Isaac said, speeches are usually for the wedding reception, so I don&rsquo;t really have anything prepared,&rdquo; I joked awkwardly, which thankfully gained a few laughs. &ldquo;I guess, thank you for all showing up. It&rsquo;s great to see so many of you again and catch up. We&rsquo;re all here to celebrate the same thing \u2013 my mum and Isaac&rsquo;s engagement.&rdquo; I looked to them both, before settling my gaze on Isaac. &ldquo;Isaac, I couldn&rsquo;t have asked for a better man to marry my mum. You make her happy and I&rsquo;m grateful. It&rsquo;s an honour to eventually be your step-daughter. So thank <i>you</i>.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I awkwardly turned off the mic and placed it on the table, sitting back down as people clapped. Isaac looked over the moon with my words which warmed my heart. He tried hard in the early stages of our relationship and it was obvious he still sought my approval. He already had it. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You did amazing,&ldquo; Brie leaned forward and muttered in my ear, a smile on her lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Thanks,&rdquo; I said, squeezing her hand and resting my other hand on our intertwined ones. I was getting used to having her next to me that I didn&rsquo;t even think twice about having to pretend to be her girlfriend. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I&rsquo;d like to add one more thing, since we&rsquo;re all giving mini speeches now,&ldquo; my mum&rsquo;s voice pulled me from my thoughts, and I looked up to see her stood up with the mic in hand. Oh, no&hellip; &quot;Firstly, thank you all for coming this week! Isaac and I are truly grateful for your support.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0More clapping whilst I froze, worried about what my mother would say. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I&rsquo;m lucky to be surrounded by people I love and who love me,&ldquo; she continued, before settling her gaze on me. &quot;Including having my wonderful daughter, Y/N, here. She doesn&rsquo;t realise this but having her here means the world to me.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everybody 'aww&rsquo;d&rsquo; whilst I tried to stop my face from looking confused. Was she serious? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Y/N even brought her girlfriend, Brie, with her,&ldquo; she said, motioning to Brie beside me, making my cheeks heat up because of all the attention from the guests. &quot;If you haven&rsquo;t met her already, introduce yourself. She&rsquo;s lovely and I couldn&rsquo;t have asked for anyone else to be with my daughter.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Mum, you really don&rsquo;t need to\u2013&quot;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Thank you for making her happy, Brie,&ldquo; my mum ignored me, looking to Brie. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie looked as red as I felt, smiling awkwardly as all eyes were on her. She cleared her throat, but didn&rsquo;t know what to say. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Here&rsquo;s to love,&rdquo; my mum finished, raising her glass in the form of a toast. &ldquo;Whether that be platonic or romantic. We should all appreciate it when we have it.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everybody raised there glasses, so Brie and I kind of had to otherwise it would look weird. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Cheers!&ldquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I took a sip of my water before watching as my mum said her final thanks and left the mic. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;That was very&hellip; surprising,&rdquo; I said to my mum when she sat down. I let go of Brie&rsquo;s hand and leaned forward. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t need to say all of that.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Well, I meant every word,&ldquo; my mum said, smiling. &quot;I&rsquo;m proud of you. And I&rsquo;m happy for you.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I pursed my lips, not knowing how to respond. See, she said things like that once in a blue moon, but I never knew whether to believe it or not because next thing she&rsquo;d be doing is dragging me down for my career or life choices. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I looked to Brie, who was stuck into her food, completely oblivious and long forgotten to what just went down. When she felt me looking, she swallowed and raised an eyebrow. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You good?&ldquo; she asked adorably. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I forgot about my confusion and smiled. &quot;I am now.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She seemed confused, but shrugged and went back to her meal, making me realise this whole thing was easier than I thought. Being Brie&rsquo;s girlfriend. It made me question why she single in the first place.</p>",

She grinned down at me. \u201cYou know, I saw an arcade on the way up here. And we technically don\u2019t have anything to do until tomorrow.\u201d </p>[[MORE]]<p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled. \u201cI saw it, too, you child.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She gave me a knowing look. \u201cDon\u2019t act like you don\u2019t want to go down there.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I rolled my eyes. \u201cOf course I do. C'mon.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She laughed and the two of us left our suitcases, deciding to head straight down to the arcade room. We walked in and saw it was huge. I wasn\u2019t expecting anything less from a five star hotel in Hawaii to be honest. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Best part about all of this is that it\u2019s free,\u201c I said to Brie, before grabbing her hand and dragging her to the first game I saw \u2013 a retro racing game. \"I\u2019ll go first and I challenge you to try and beat me.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"A whole beach and we\u2019re in here playing arcade games,\u201c Brie said, shaking her with amusement. \"You\u2019re on, Y/L/N.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I grinned before leaning over the console, using the buttons to control the car onscreen. I felt Brie behind me, leaning her head on my shoulder and watching closely which made me smile. When the game ended and I came in third place, I gave her a teasing smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Your go,\u201c I said, stepping to the side. \"Good luck.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Won\u2019t need it,\u201c she said, grinning as she had her go. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I stood behind her, watching as she had her go. I hugged her from behind, leaning my head on her shoulder as I watched carefully. She was nearing second place and I grew nervous. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You should have picked a different game because I\u2019m totally about to kick your butt,\u201d she said with a smirk, her eyes glued to the screen. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Game isn\u2019t over yet,\u201c I mumbled, watching the map in the corner. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Laughter flew from her lips as she crossed the finish line, coming in first place. I let go of her waist and she turned around, grinning down at me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You were saying?\u201d she teased with a raised eyebrow. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I couldn\u2019t stop myself from smiling, despite the fact that she\u2019d won. She looked so cute and her happiness was contagious. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y/N? Is that you?\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A voice pulled us from our friendly competition and my smile faded when I turned and saw one of my mum\u2019s colleagues approaching us. She had her kid following behind, his eyes glued to his phone as if he\u2019d rather be anywhere else but here. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mrs. Carter,\u201d I greeted with a forced smile. \u201cYes, it\u2019s me.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wow, you\u2019ve grown up!\u201c she said in what I think was a nice voice. She looked me up and down before seeing Brie stood next to me. \"And this must be your girlfriend! Your mum mentioned.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie glanced at me before smiling politely at Mrs. Carter. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Brie.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Great to meet you, Brie,\u201c Mrs. Carter said, a smile on her face. She looked between us both before adding, \"What a lovely couple you both make.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I felt my cheeks growing warm. \u201cErm, thanks, Mrs. Carter.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This is my son, Harry,\u201c she said, before stepping to the side to reveal her young son, playing a game on his phone. \"He wanted to play in the arcade so here we are!\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I nodded, smiling awkwardly. \u201cLovely.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Harry, say hi, don\u2019t be rude,\u201c she urged her son to speak, and when he didn\u2019t listen, she grabbed his phone from his grasp, making me stifle a chuckle. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie snickered behind me, only fuelling my laughter. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mum!\u201d Harry whined, before looking at us. When he saw Brie, his eyes widened. \u201cYou\u2019re that girl!\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie raised an eyebrow. \u201cHuh?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The new superhero! They announced it on Marvel\u2019s instagram!\u201c he continued, excited now. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Captain Marvel,\u201d I filled in for him, to which he nodded enthusiastically. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah! Captain Marvel!\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie laughed. \"Yeah, that\u2019s me, Harry. Do you want a photo?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He nodded, starstruck at the sight of Brie. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That okay with you?\u201c she asked Mrs. Carter, who seemed glad that her son was talking to actual people. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She nodded, smiling. \"Of course.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I watched as Brie kneeled down and took a selfie with Harry. I sometimes forgot that Brie was becoming a bigger and bigger star every day, especially now that she was going to be apart of the Marvel universe. It was hard to remember when she was always my best friend, not this fancy Oscar-winning actress. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Right, well we should be going now,\u201c Mrs. Carter said after their photo. She looked to me, winking playfully. \"You bagged a good one here, Y/N.\u201d She looked to Brie. \u201cGreat to meet you, Brie. I\u2019ll see you girls tomorrow at the party!\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We both waved goodbye as she left the arcade room, eventually being left alone. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Cute kid, funny mum,\u201c Brie commented, and I looked to her before we both started to laugh. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"One of my mum\u2019s colleagues down, ten million more to go,\u201d I said, rolling my eyes playfully. \u201cThanks again for being here.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Anything for my girlfriend,\u201c she joked, wrapping an arm around my shoulders and leading me to the next game \u2013 basketball. \"New challenge?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re on.\u201d </p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0First day in Hawaii wasn\u2019t so bad and that was because I forgot, for a moment, why I was there in the first place. Brie and I had fun in the arcade, hung out in the hot tub and went for a walk on the beach. She ended up going to the gym that evening, since she promised her trainer she\u2019d keep on top of everything whilst out here, but when she came back, we went for dinner at the hotel\u2019s restaurant and then headed to bed. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Today, however, was the first day of many that I was dreading. My mum\u2019s engagement party. It was an outdoor party, in a lovely courtyard by the beach and I admittedly fell in love with the decorations and layout. But then I saw the guests and was reminded of the mingling. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You see your mum?\u201c Brie asked from beside me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I looked around and spotted my mum by the buffet table, standing with Isaac and talking to some guests. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Over there,\u201d I said, nodding in her direction, before looking to Brie. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She looked <i>really </i>good, I must admit. She was wearing a light blue pantsuit, a belt wrapped around her waist, accentuating her figure. Her short blonde hair was left out and she had minimal makeup on, but she didn\u2019t really need it. Yeah, definitely a superstar. A beautiful one at that. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You wanna say hi?\u201c she asked, meeting my eyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I shook my head, not yet ready to face my mum and her probable snarky comments about what a failure I was. \"I\u2019m good.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She cracked a smile. \u201cOkay, how about this. I go and get a drink, greet them, say you\u2019re in the toilet or something, and you can say hi later. That way we aren\u2019t being rude by not going over there at all.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled. \u201cThis. This is why I love you.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She laughed and squeezed my hand gently before letting go and walking over there. I busied myself by turning around and pulling out my phone. It didn\u2019t last long though, because I felt a presence before me. When I looked up, I resisted the urge to roll my eyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Look who it is - our favourite cousin!\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019m your only cousin,\u201d I pointed out to Naomi, one of two of my annoying cousins. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hence our favourite!\u201c Naomi grinned, and I groaned inwardly. \"Long time, no see, Y/N.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Could have been longer,\u201c I mumbled.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It\u2019s amazing how we\u2019re all back together after so long,\u201d Naomi commented, before glancing at her brother. \u201cDon\u2019t you think, Kieran?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kieran nodded. \u201cDefinitely. You still doing that whole counselling thing, Y/N?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah,\u201c I answered with a bored voice. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Too much work involved to just be a doctor, I assume,\u201d he said, before snickering with his sister. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I rolled my eyes and chose not to say anything. They weren\u2019t worth it and if I didn\u2019t let them get to me, they wouldn\u2019t win, right? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Little birdy told us that you brought someone with you this week,\u201c Naomi said, smiling deviously at me. \"Some actress?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The hot blonde from that Kong: Skull Island film, I heard,\u201c Kieran added with a smirk. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She\u2019s got a name,\u201d I snapped, glaring at Kieran. \u201cIt\u2019s Brie, not \u2018the hot blonde\u2019. And I\u2019d appreciate it if you didn\u2019t refer to her as that.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Woah, someone\u2019s defensive!\u201c Naomi laughed, nudging her brother. \"Better back off, Kieran. It sounds serious.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I see you both haven\u2019t changed,\u201c I said harshly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, but you have,\u201d Naomi said, glaring down at me with a devilish smile on her lips, \u201chaven\u2019t you, Y/N? Rubbing shoulders with celebrities now.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I scoffed, crossing my arms. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Where is she, anyway?\u201c Kieran asked, quirking an eyebrow. \"You make her up?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What, like you made up that marriage two years ago?\u201c I retorted, staring at him.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His smirk faded into an angry frown. \"That wasn\u2019t made up \u2013 she wanted a divorce as soon as it happened. It was a rough time.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I suppressed a smile. \u201cRiiiiiight.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Listen, you little\u2013\"</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Babe, there you are!\u201c Brie\u2019s voice cut off Naomi, and I felt an arm lace around my waist before feeling a kiss on my cheek, quite close to the corner of my lips which made me feel warm inside. I turned and saw Brie smiling by my side. Saved by the bell, I guess. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey,\u201d I said, returning the smile, also trying not to laugh at Naomi\u2019s change in expression. \u201cBrie, these are my cousins. Naomi and Kieran.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I watched as Naomi and Kieran forced smiles on their faces and greeted Brie. I almost wanted to take a picture of this moment because it was too good. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This is my girlfriend, Brie,\u201c I introduced her to them, giving them a knowing grin. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They didn\u2019t know what to say and I glanced at Brie, only to see her suppressing a laugh. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nice meeting you, Brie, but my brother and I should get going,\u201d Naomi said as politely as she could muster. \u201cBye.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie waved with a grin on her lips, and when they both disappeared, I breathed out in relief before giving Brie a hug. She was surprised, but laughed and returned the hug. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What was that for?\u201c she asked when I pulled away, a smile on her lips and a sparkle in her eyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Coming in when you did,\u201d I said, not quite letting go of her arms just yet. \u201cNaomi was about to bite my head off.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She rolled her eyes playfully. \u201cTypical Y/N. I leave you alone for two minutes.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I chuckled. \u201cSeriously, though. One conversation with them and I already want to kill them. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here with me.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Anytime,\u201c she said, giving me a knowing look. \"You\u2019ve got this.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I sighed, glancing around, looking at everyone we\u2019d have to greet otherwise my mum would kill me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, I think I do,\u201c I said, nodding. \"Just don\u2019t leave me alone again please.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She laughed and intertwined our fingers, gently rocking our hands between us. \u201cI won\u2019t, Y/N. I promise.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We walked a little, a silence settling between us, before I blurted out, \u201cYou look really nice by the way.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie smiled, but her cheeks flushed a little. \u201cThanks\u2026 so do you. I was going to tell you earlier, but you were having a mental breakdown, so\u2026\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I breathed out, suppressing a smile. \u201cSounds about right. But thanks.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I looked to her and saw her smiling to herself, only making me smile, too. I realised I quite liked the feeling of her hand in mine. </p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"\u2026and I want to thank you all for being here to celebrate with us this week,\u201c Isaac said, grinning at everybody in the marquee set up for the lunch. \"Y/M/N and I couldn\u2019t be any more happier to celebrate with all of our friends and family.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everybody began to clap and cheer for the engaged couple, making Isaac pause momentarily. Brie and I joined in with the clapping, and admittedly, I smiled at Isaac and my mum, happy that they were happy. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Now, speaking of family, I know speeches are for the wedding reception, but I wanted to say something quick,\u201c he continued when the clapping came to a stop. His eyes fell on me, myself sat opposite him on the lead table. \"Y/N, I wanted to thank you for always being so supportive of your mother and I\u2019s relationship. It\u2019s very reassuring to know I have your approval and I\u2019m glad I can eventually call you my step-daughter. Thank you.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled awkwardly, not appreciating the attention of everyone in the room on me right now. People clapped and some began to chant \u201cspeech! speech!\u201d making me widen my eyes. Hell to the no. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You want to make a speech?\u201c Isaac asked, a hopeful glint in his eyes as he held out the microphone. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Er\u2026\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Go on, Y/N, you got this,\u201c Brie encouraged, grinning beside me, before grabbing my hand and squeezing gently. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Not really having a choice, I stood up and accepted the microphone, watching as Isaac took his seat and everybody went quiet. All eyes were on me and I felt Brie letting go of my hand, but I pulled it back, intertwining our fingers. Moral support was good right now, and she made me feel a lot better. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Erm, well, as Isaac said, speeches are usually for the wedding reception, so I don\u2019t really have anything prepared,\u201d I joked awkwardly, which thankfully gained a few laughs. \u201cI guess, thank you for all showing up. It\u2019s great to see so many of you again and catch up. We\u2019re all here to celebrate the same thing \u2013 my mum and Isaac\u2019s engagement.\u201d I looked to them both, before settling my gaze on Isaac. \u201cIsaac, I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better man to marry my mum. You make her happy and I\u2019m grateful. It\u2019s an honour to eventually be your step-daughter. So thank <i>you</i>.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I awkwardly turned off the mic and placed it on the table, sitting back down as people clapped. Isaac looked over the moon with my words which warmed my heart. He tried hard in the early stages of our relationship and it was obvious he still sought my approval. He already had it. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You did amazing,\u201c Brie leaned forward and muttered in my ear, a smile on her lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks,\u201d I said, squeezing her hand and resting my other hand on our intertwined ones. I was getting used to having her next to me that I didn\u2019t even think twice about having to pretend to be her girlfriend. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019d like to add one more thing, since we\u2019re all giving mini speeches now,\u201c my mum\u2019s voice pulled me from my thoughts, and I looked up to see her stood up with the mic in hand. Oh, no\u2026 \"Firstly, thank you all for coming this week! Isaac and I are truly grateful for your support.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0More clapping whilst I froze, worried about what my mother would say. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019m lucky to be surrounded by people I love and who love me,\u201c she continued, before settling her gaze on me. \"Including having my wonderful daughter, Y/N, here. She doesn\u2019t realise this but having her here means the world to me.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everybody 'aww\u2019d\u2019 whilst I tried to stop my face from looking confused. Was she serious? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y/N even brought her girlfriend, Brie, with her,\u201c she said, motioning to Brie beside me, making my cheeks heat up because of all the attention from the guests. \"If you haven\u2019t met her already, introduce yourself. She\u2019s lovely and I couldn\u2019t have asked for anyone else to be with my daughter.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mum, you really don\u2019t need to\u2013\"</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thank you for making her happy, Brie,\u201c my mum ignored me, looking to Brie. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie looked as red as I felt, smiling awkwardly as all eyes were on her. She cleared her throat, but didn\u2019t know what to say. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Here\u2019s to love,\u201d my mum finished, raising her glass in the form of a toast. \u201cWhether that be platonic or romantic. We should all appreciate it when we have it.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everybody raised there glasses, so Brie and I kind of had to otherwise it would look weird. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Cheers!\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I took a sip of my water before watching as my mum said her final thanks and left the mic. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That was very\u2026 surprising,\u201d I said to my mum when she sat down. I let go of Brie\u2019s hand and leaned forward. \u201cYou didn\u2019t need to say all of that.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, I meant every word,\u201c my mum said, smiling. \"I\u2019m proud of you. And I\u2019m happy for you.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I pursed my lips, not knowing how to respond. See, she said things like that once in a blue moon, but I never knew whether to believe it or not because next thing she\u2019d be doing is dragging me down for my career or life choices. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I looked to Brie, who was stuck into her food, completely oblivious and long forgotten to what just went down. When she felt me looking, she swallowed and raised an eyebrow. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You good?\u201c she asked adorably. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I forgot about my confusion and smiled. \"I am now.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She seemed confused, but shrugged and went back to her meal, making me realise this whole thing was easier than I thought. Being Brie\u2019s girlfriend. It made me question why she single in the first place.</p>",

We had the perfect view of the beach.<br></p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"As if your mum booked us the best room after hers,\u201c Brie said from behind me, and I turned to see her looking in the mini fridge. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Gotta let everyone know her daughter is well looked after,\u201d I muttered, before dropping myself on the queen-sized. I glared at the ceiling. \u201cDamn that softness.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie laughed before dropping herself beside me, leaning on her elbows. She grinned down at me. \u201cYou know, I saw an arcade on the way up here. And we technically don\u2019t have anything to do until tomorrow.\u201d </p>[[MORE]]<p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled. \u201cI saw it, too, you child.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She gave me a knowing look. \u201cDon\u2019t act like you don\u2019t want to go down there.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I rolled my eyes. \u201cOf course I do. C'mon.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She laughed and the two of us left our suitcases, deciding to head straight down to the arcade room. We walked in and saw it was huge. I wasn\u2019t expecting anything less from a five star hotel in Hawaii to be honest. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Best part about all of this is that it\u2019s free,\u201c I said to Brie, before grabbing her hand and dragging her to the first game I saw \u2013 a retro racing game. \"I\u2019ll go first and I challenge you to try and beat me.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"A whole beach and we\u2019re in here playing arcade games,\u201c Brie said, shaking her with amusement. \"You\u2019re on, Y/L/N.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I grinned before leaning over the console, using the buttons to control the car onscreen. I felt Brie behind me, leaning her head on my shoulder and watching closely which made me smile. When the game ended and I came in third place, I gave her a teasing smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Your go,\u201c I said, stepping to the side. \"Good luck.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Won\u2019t need it,\u201c she said, grinning as she had her go. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I stood behind her, watching as she had her go. I hugged her from behind, leaning my head on her shoulder as I watched carefully. She was nearing second place and I grew nervous. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You should have picked a different game because I\u2019m totally about to kick your butt,\u201d she said with a smirk, her eyes glued to the screen. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Game isn\u2019t over yet,\u201c I mumbled, watching the map in the corner. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Laughter flew from her lips as she crossed the finish line, coming in first place. I let go of her waist and she turned around, grinning down at me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You were saying?\u201d she teased with a raised eyebrow. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I couldn\u2019t stop myself from smiling, despite the fact that she\u2019d won. She looked so cute and her happiness was contagious. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y/N? Is that you?\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A voice pulled us from our friendly competition and my smile faded when I turned and saw one of my mum\u2019s colleagues approaching us. She had her kid following behind, his eyes glued to his phone as if he\u2019d rather be anywhere else but here. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mrs. Carter,\u201d I greeted with a forced smile. \u201cYes, it\u2019s me.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wow, you\u2019ve grown up!\u201c she said in what I think was a nice voice. She looked me up and down before seeing Brie stood next to me. \"And this must be your girlfriend! Your mum mentioned.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie glanced at me before smiling politely at Mrs. Carter. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Brie.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Great to meet you, Brie,\u201c Mrs. Carter said, a smile on her face. She looked between us both before adding, \"What a lovely couple you both make.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I felt my cheeks growing warm. \u201cErm, thanks, Mrs. Carter.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This is my son, Harry,\u201c she said, before stepping to the side to reveal her young son, playing a game on his phone. \"He wanted to play in the arcade so here we are!\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I nodded, smiling awkwardly. \u201cLovely.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Harry, say hi, don\u2019t be rude,\u201c she urged her son to speak, and when he didn\u2019t listen, she grabbed his phone from his grasp, making me stifle a chuckle. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie snickered behind me, only fuelling my laughter. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mum!\u201d Harry whined, before looking at us. When he saw Brie, his eyes widened. \u201cYou\u2019re that girl!\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie raised an eyebrow. \u201cHuh?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The new superhero! They announced it on Marvel\u2019s instagram!\u201c he continued, excited now. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Captain Marvel,\u201d I filled in for him, to which he nodded enthusiastically. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah! Captain Marvel!\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie laughed. \"Yeah, that\u2019s me, Harry. Do you want a photo?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He nodded, starstruck at the sight of Brie. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That okay with you?\u201c she asked Mrs. Carter, who seemed glad that her son was talking to actual people. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She nodded, smiling. \"Of course.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I watched as Brie kneeled down and took a selfie with Harry. I sometimes forgot that Brie was becoming a bigger and bigger star every day, especially now that she was going to be apart of the Marvel universe. It was hard to remember when she was always my best friend, not this fancy Oscar-winning actress. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Right, well we should be going now,\u201c Mrs. Carter said after their photo. She looked to me, winking playfully. \"You bagged a good one here, Y/N.\u201d She looked to Brie. \u201cGreat to meet you, Brie. I\u2019ll see you girls tomorrow at the party!\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We both waved goodbye as she left the arcade room, eventually being left alone. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Cute kid, funny mum,\u201c Brie commented, and I looked to her before we both started to laugh. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"One of my mum\u2019s colleagues down, ten million more to go,\u201d I said, rolling my eyes playfully. \u201cThanks again for being here.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Anything for my girlfriend,\u201c she joked, wrapping an arm around my shoulders and leading me to the next game \u2013 basketball. \"New challenge?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re on.\u201d </p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0First day in Hawaii wasn\u2019t so bad and that was because I forgot, for a moment, why I was there in the first place. Brie and I had fun in the arcade, hung out in the hot tub and went for a walk on the beach. She ended up going to the gym that evening, since she promised her trainer she\u2019d keep on top of everything whilst out here, but when she came back, we went for dinner at the hotel\u2019s restaurant and then headed to bed. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Today, however, was the first day of many that I was dreading. My mum\u2019s engagement party. It was an outdoor party, in a lovely courtyard by the beach and I admittedly fell in love with the decorations and layout. But then I saw the guests and was reminded of the mingling. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You see your mum?\u201c Brie asked from beside me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I looked around and spotted my mum by the buffet table, standing with Isaac and talking to some guests. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Over there,\u201d I said, nodding in her direction, before looking to Brie. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She looked <i>really </i>good, I must admit. She was wearing a light blue pantsuit, a belt wrapped around her waist, accentuating her figure. Her short blonde hair was left out and she had minimal makeup on, but she didn\u2019t really need it. Yeah, definitely a superstar. A beautiful one at that. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You wanna say hi?\u201c she asked, meeting my eyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I shook my head, not yet ready to face my mum and her probable snarky comments about what a failure I was. \"I\u2019m good.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She cracked a smile. \u201cOkay, how about this. I go and get a drink, greet them, say you\u2019re in the toilet or something, and you can say hi later. That way we aren\u2019t being rude by not going over there at all.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled. \u201cThis. This is why I love you.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She laughed and squeezed my hand gently before letting go and walking over there. I busied myself by turning around and pulling out my phone. It didn\u2019t last long though, because I felt a presence before me. When I looked up, I resisted the urge to roll my eyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Look who it is - our favourite cousin!\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019m your only cousin,\u201d I pointed out to Naomi, one of two of my annoying cousins. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hence our favourite!\u201c Naomi grinned, and I groaned inwardly. \"Long time, no see, Y/N.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Could have been longer,\u201c I mumbled.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It\u2019s amazing how we\u2019re all back together after so long,\u201d Naomi commented, before glancing at her brother. \u201cDon\u2019t you think, Kieran?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kieran nodded. \u201cDefinitely. You still doing that whole counselling thing, Y/N?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah,\u201c I answered with a bored voice. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Too much work involved to just be a doctor, I assume,\u201d he said, before snickering with his sister. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I rolled my eyes and chose not to say anything. They weren\u2019t worth it and if I didn\u2019t let them get to me, they wouldn\u2019t win, right? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Little birdy told us that you brought someone with you this week,\u201c Naomi said, smiling deviously at me. \"Some actress?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The hot blonde from that Kong: Skull Island film, I heard,\u201c Kieran added with a smirk. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She\u2019s got a name,\u201d I snapped, glaring at Kieran. \u201cIt\u2019s Brie, not \u2018the hot blonde\u2019. And I\u2019d appreciate it if you didn\u2019t refer to her as that.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Woah, someone\u2019s defensive!\u201c Naomi laughed, nudging her brother. \"Better back off, Kieran. It sounds serious.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I see you both haven\u2019t changed,\u201c I said harshly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, but you have,\u201d Naomi said, glaring down at me with a devilish smile on her lips, \u201chaven\u2019t you, Y/N? Rubbing shoulders with celebrities now.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I scoffed, crossing my arms. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Where is she, anyway?\u201c Kieran asked, quirking an eyebrow. \"You make her up?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What, like you made up that marriage two years ago?\u201c I retorted, staring at him.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His smirk faded into an angry frown. \"That wasn\u2019t made up \u2013 she wanted a divorce as soon as it happened. It was a rough time.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I suppressed a smile. \u201cRiiiiiight.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Listen, you little\u2013\"</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Babe, there you are!\u201c Brie\u2019s voice cut off Naomi, and I felt an arm lace around my waist before feeling a kiss on my cheek, quite close to the corner of my lips which made me feel warm inside. I turned and saw Brie smiling by my side. Saved by the bell, I guess. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey,\u201d I said, returning the smile, also trying not to laugh at Naomi\u2019s change in expression. \u201cBrie, these are my cousins. Naomi and Kieran.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I watched as Naomi and Kieran forced smiles on their faces and greeted Brie. I almost wanted to take a picture of this moment because it was too good. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This is my girlfriend, Brie,\u201c I introduced her to them, giving them a knowing grin. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They didn\u2019t know what to say and I glanced at Brie, only to see her suppressing a laugh. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nice meeting you, Brie, but my brother and I should get going,\u201d Naomi said as politely as she could muster. \u201cBye.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie waved with a grin on her lips, and when they both disappeared, I breathed out in relief before giving Brie a hug. She was surprised, but laughed and returned the hug. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What was that for?\u201c she asked when I pulled away, a smile on her lips and a sparkle in her eyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Coming in when you did,\u201d I said, not quite letting go of her arms just yet. \u201cNaomi was about to bite my head off.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She rolled her eyes playfully. \u201cTypical Y/N. I leave you alone for two minutes.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I chuckled. \u201cSeriously, though. One conversation with them and I already want to kill them. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here with me.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Anytime,\u201c she said, giving me a knowing look. \"You\u2019ve got this.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I sighed, glancing around, looking at everyone we\u2019d have to greet otherwise my mum would kill me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, I think I do,\u201c I said, nodding. \"Just don\u2019t leave me alone again please.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She laughed and intertwined our fingers, gently rocking our hands between us. \u201cI won\u2019t, Y/N. I promise.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We walked a little, a silence settling between us, before I blurted out, \u201cYou look really nice by the way.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie smiled, but her cheeks flushed a little. \u201cThanks\u2026 so do you. I was going to tell you earlier, but you were having a mental breakdown, so\u2026\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I breathed out, suppressing a smile. \u201cSounds about right. But thanks.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I looked to her and saw her smiling to herself, only making me smile, too. I realised I quite liked the feeling of her hand in mine. </p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"\u2026and I want to thank you all for being here to celebrate with us this week,\u201c Isaac said, grinning at everybody in the marquee set up for the lunch. \"Y/M/N and I couldn\u2019t be any more happier to celebrate with all of our friends and family.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everybody began to clap and cheer for the engaged couple, making Isaac pause momentarily. Brie and I joined in with the clapping, and admittedly, I smiled at Isaac and my mum, happy that they were happy. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Now, speaking of family, I know speeches are for the wedding reception, but I wanted to say something quick,\u201c he continued when the clapping came to a stop. His eyes fell on me, myself sat opposite him on the lead table. \"Y/N, I wanted to thank you for always being so supportive of your mother and I\u2019s relationship. It\u2019s very reassuring to know I have your approval and I\u2019m glad I can eventually call you my step-daughter. Thank you.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled awkwardly, not appreciating the attention of everyone in the room on me right now. People clapped and some began to chant \u201cspeech! speech!\u201d making me widen my eyes. Hell to the no. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You want to make a speech?\u201c Isaac asked, a hopeful glint in his eyes as he held out the microphone. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Er\u2026\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Go on, Y/N, you got this,\u201c Brie encouraged, grinning beside me, before grabbing my hand and squeezing gently. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Not really having a choice, I stood up and accepted the microphone, watching as Isaac took his seat and everybody went quiet. All eyes were on me and I felt Brie letting go of my hand, but I pulled it back, intertwining our fingers. Moral support was good right now, and she made me feel a lot better. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Erm, well, as Isaac said, speeches are usually for the wedding reception, so I don\u2019t really have anything prepared,\u201d I joked awkwardly, which thankfully gained a few laughs. \u201cI guess, thank you for all showing up. It\u2019s great to see so many of you again and catch up. We\u2019re all here to celebrate the same thing \u2013 my mum and Isaac\u2019s engagement.\u201d I looked to them both, before settling my gaze on Isaac. \u201cIsaac, I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better man to marry my mum. You make her happy and I\u2019m grateful. It\u2019s an honour to eventually be your step-daughter. So thank <i>you</i>.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I awkwardly turned off the mic and placed it on the table, sitting back down as people clapped. Isaac looked over the moon with my words which warmed my heart. He tried hard in the early stages of our relationship and it was obvious he still sought my approval. He already had it. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You did amazing,\u201c Brie leaned forward and muttered in my ear, a smile on her lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks,\u201d I said, squeezing her hand and resting my other hand on our intertwined ones. I was getting used to having her next to me that I didn\u2019t even think twice about having to pretend to be her girlfriend. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019d like to add one more thing, since we\u2019re all giving mini speeches now,\u201c my mum\u2019s voice pulled me from my thoughts, and I looked up to see her stood up with the mic in hand. Oh, no\u2026 \"Firstly, thank you all for coming this week! Isaac and I are truly grateful for your support.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0More clapping whilst I froze, worried about what my mother would say. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019m lucky to be surrounded by people I love and who love me,\u201c she continued, before settling her gaze on me. \"Including having my wonderful daughter, Y/N, here. She doesn\u2019t realise this but having her here means the world to me.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everybody 'aww\u2019d\u2019 whilst I tried to stop my face from looking confused. Was she serious? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y/N even brought her girlfriend, Brie, with her,\u201c she said, motioning to Brie beside me, making my cheeks heat up because of all the attention from the guests. \"If you haven\u2019t met her already, introduce yourself. She\u2019s lovely and I couldn\u2019t have asked for anyone else to be with my daughter.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mum, you really don\u2019t need to\u2013\"</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thank you for making her happy, Brie,\u201c my mum ignored me, looking to Brie. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie looked as red as I felt, smiling awkwardly as all eyes were on her. She cleared her throat, but didn\u2019t know what to say. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Here\u2019s to love,\u201d my mum finished, raising her glass in the form of a toast. \u201cWhether that be platonic or romantic. We should all appreciate it when we have it.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everybody raised there glasses, so Brie and I kind of had to otherwise it would look weird. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Cheers!\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I took a sip of my water before watching as my mum said her final thanks and left the mic. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That was very\u2026 surprising,\u201d I said to my mum when she sat down. I let go of Brie\u2019s hand and leaned forward. \u201cYou didn\u2019t need to say all of that.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, I meant every word,\u201c my mum said, smiling. \"I\u2019m proud of you. And I\u2019m happy for you.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I pursed my lips, not knowing how to respond. See, she said things like that once in a blue moon, but I never knew whether to believe it or not because next thing she\u2019d be doing is dragging me down for my career or life choices. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I looked to Brie, who was stuck into her food, completely oblivious and long forgotten to what just went down. When she felt me looking, she swallowed and raised an eyebrow. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You good?\u201c she asked adorably. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I forgot about my confusion and smiled. \"I am now.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She seemed confused, but shrugged and went back to her meal, making me realise this whole thing was easier than I thought. Being Brie\u2019s girlfriend. It made me question why she single in the first place.</p>",

We had the perfect view of the beach.<br /></p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"As if your mum booked us the best room after hers,&ldquo; Brie said from behind me, and I turned to see her looking in the mini fridge. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Gotta let everyone know her daughter is well looked after,&rdquo; I muttered, before dropping myself on the queen-sized. I glared at the ceiling. &ldquo;Damn that softness.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brie laughed before dropping herself beside me, leaning on her elbows. She grinned down at me. &ldquo;You know, I saw an arcade on the way up here. And we technically don&rsquo;t have anything to do until tomorrow.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I smiled. &ldquo;I saw it, too, you child.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She gave me a knowing look. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t act like you don&rsquo;t want to go down there.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I rolled my eyes. &ldquo;Of course I do. C'mon.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She laughed and the two of us left our suitcases, deciding to head straight down to the arcade room. We walked in and saw it was huge. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting anything less from a five star hotel in Hawaii to be honest. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Best part about all of this is that it&rsquo;s free,&ldquo; I said to Brie, before grabbing her hand and dragging her to the first game I saw &ndash; a retro racing game. \"I&rsquo;ll go first and I challenge you to try and beat me.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"A whole beach and we&rsquo;re in here playing arcade games,&ldquo; Brie said, shaking her with amusement. \"You&rsquo;re on, Y/L/N.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I grinned before leaning over the console, using the buttons to control the car onscreen. I felt Brie behind me, leaning her head on my shoulder and watching closely which made me smile. When the game ended and I came in third place, I gave her a teasing smile. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Your go,&ldquo; I said, stepping to the side. \"Good luck.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Won&rsquo;t need it,&ldquo; she said, grinning as she had her go. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I stood behind her, watching as she had her go. I hugged her from behind, leaning my head on her shoulder as I watched carefully. She was nearing second place and I grew nervous. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You should have picked a different game because I&rsquo;m totally about to kick your butt,&rdquo; she said with a smirk, her eyes glued to the screen. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Game isn&rsquo;t over yet,&ldquo; I mumbled, watching the map in the corner. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Laughter flew from her lips as she crossed the finish line, coming in first place. I let go of her waist and she turned around, grinning down at me. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You were saying?&rdquo; she teased with a raised eyebrow. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t stop myself from smiling, despite the fact that she&rsquo;d won. She looked so cute and her happiness was contagious. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Y/N? Is that you?&ldquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A voice pulled us from our friendly competition and my smile faded when I turned and saw one of my mum&rsquo;s colleagues approaching us. She had her kid following behind, his eyes glued to his phone as if he&rsquo;d rather be anywhere else but here. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Mrs. Carter,&rdquo; I greeted with a forced smile. &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s me.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Wow, you&rsquo;ve grown up!&ldquo; she said in what I think was a nice voice. She looked me up and down before seeing Brie stood next to me. \"And this must be your girlfriend! Your mum mentioned.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brie glanced at me before smiling politely at Mrs. Carter. &ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Brie.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Great to meet you, Brie,&ldquo; Mrs. Carter said, a smile on her face. She looked between us both before adding, \"What a lovely couple you both make.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I felt my cheeks growing warm. &ldquo;Erm, thanks, Mrs. Carter.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"This is my son, Harry,&ldquo; she said, before stepping to the side to reveal her young son, playing a game on his phone. \"He wanted to play in the arcade so here we are!&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I nodded, smiling awkwardly. &ldquo;Lovely.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Harry, say hi, don&rsquo;t be rude,&ldquo; she urged her son to speak, and when he didn&rsquo;t listen, she grabbed his phone from his grasp, making me stifle a chuckle. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brie snickered behind me, only fuelling my laughter. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Mum!&rdquo; Harry whined, before looking at us. When he saw Brie, his eyes widened. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re that girl!&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brie raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"The new superhero! They announced it on Marvel&rsquo;s instagram!&ldquo; he continued, excited now. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Captain Marvel,&rdquo; I filled in for him, to which he nodded enthusiastically. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Yeah! Captain Marvel!&ldquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brie laughed. \"Yeah, that&rsquo;s me, Harry. Do you want a photo?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He nodded, starstruck at the sight of Brie. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"That okay with you?&ldquo; she asked Mrs. Carter, who seemed glad that her son was talking to actual people. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She nodded, smiling. \"Of course.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I watched as Brie kneeled down and took a selfie with Harry. I sometimes forgot that Brie was becoming a bigger and bigger star every day, especially now that she was going to be apart of the Marvel universe. It was hard to remember when she was always my best friend, not this fancy Oscar-winning actress. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Right, well we should be going now,&ldquo; Mrs. Carter said after their photo. She looked to me, winking playfully. \"You bagged a good one here, Y/N.&rdquo; She looked to Brie. &ldquo;Great to meet you, Brie. I&rsquo;ll see you girls tomorrow at the party!&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We both waved goodbye as she left the arcade room, eventually being left alone. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Cute kid, funny mum,&ldquo; Brie commented, and I looked to her before we both started to laugh. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"One of my mum&rsquo;s colleagues down, ten million more to go,&rdquo; I said, rolling my eyes playfully. &ldquo;Thanks again for being here.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Anything for my girlfriend,&ldquo; she joked, wrapping an arm around my shoulders and leading me to the next game &ndash; basketball. \"New challenge?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I grinned. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re on.&rdquo; </p><p>***</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;First day in Hawaii wasn&rsquo;t so bad and that was because I forgot, for a moment, why I was there in the first place. Brie and I had fun in the arcade, hung out in the hot tub and went for a walk on the beach. She ended up going to the gym that evening, since she promised her trainer she&rsquo;d keep on top of everything whilst out here, but when she came back, we went for dinner at the hotel&rsquo;s restaurant and then headed to bed. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Today, however, was the first day of many that I was dreading. My mum&rsquo;s engagement party. It was an outdoor party, in a lovely courtyard by the beach and I admittedly fell in love with the decorations and layout. But then I saw the guests and was reminded of the mingling. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You see your mum?&ldquo; Brie asked from beside me. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I looked around and spotted my mum by the buffet table, standing with Isaac and talking to some guests. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Over there,&rdquo; I said, nodding in her direction, before looking to Brie. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She looked <i>really </i>good, I must admit. She was wearing a light blue pantsuit, a belt wrapped around her waist, accentuating her figure. Her short blonde hair was left out and she had minimal makeup on, but she didn&rsquo;t really need it. Yeah, definitely a superstar. A beautiful one at that. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You wanna say hi?&ldquo; she asked, meeting my eyes. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I shook my head, not yet ready to face my mum and her probable snarky comments about what a failure I was. \"I&rsquo;m good.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She cracked a smile. &ldquo;Okay, how about this. I go and get a drink, greet them, say you&rsquo;re in the toilet or something, and you can say hi later. That way we aren&rsquo;t being rude by not going over there at all.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I smiled. &ldquo;This. This is why I love you.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She laughed and squeezed my hand gently before letting go and walking over there. I busied myself by turning around and pulling out my phone. It didn&rsquo;t last long though, because I felt a presence before me. When I looked up, I resisted the urge to roll my eyes. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Look who it is - our favourite cousin!&ldquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I&rsquo;m your only cousin,&rdquo; I pointed out to Naomi, one of two of my annoying cousins. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Hence our favourite!&ldquo; Naomi grinned, and I groaned inwardly. \"Long time, no see, Y/N.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Could have been longer,&ldquo; I mumbled.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"It&rsquo;s amazing how we&rsquo;re all back together after so long,&rdquo; Naomi commented, before glancing at her brother. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, Kieran?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kieran nodded. &ldquo;Definitely. You still doing that whole counselling thing, Y/N?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Yeah,&ldquo; I answered with a bored voice. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Too much work involved to just be a doctor, I assume,&rdquo; he said, before snickering with his sister. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I rolled my eyes and chose not to say anything. They weren&rsquo;t worth it and if I didn&rsquo;t let them get to me, they wouldn&rsquo;t win, right? </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Little birdy told us that you brought someone with you this week,&ldquo; Naomi said, smiling deviously at me. \"Some actress?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"The hot blonde from that Kong: Skull Island film, I heard,&ldquo; Kieran added with a smirk. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"She&rsquo;s got a name,&rdquo; I snapped, glaring at Kieran. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Brie, not &lsquo;the hot blonde&rsquo;. And I&rsquo;d appreciate it if you didn&rsquo;t refer to her as that.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Woah, someone&rsquo;s defensive!&ldquo; Naomi laughed, nudging her brother. \"Better back off, Kieran. It sounds serious.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I see you both haven&rsquo;t changed,&ldquo; I said harshly. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Oh, but you have,&rdquo; Naomi said, glaring down at me with a devilish smile on her lips, &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t you, Y/N? Rubbing shoulders with celebrities now.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I scoffed, crossing my arms. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Where is she, anyway?&ldquo; Kieran asked, quirking an eyebrow. \"You make her up?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"What, like you made up that marriage two years ago?&ldquo; I retorted, staring at him.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His smirk faded into an angry frown. \"That wasn&rsquo;t made up &ndash; she wanted a divorce as soon as it happened. It was a rough time.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I suppressed a smile. &ldquo;Riiiiiight.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Listen, you little&ndash;\"</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Babe, there you are!&ldquo; Brie&rsquo;s voice cut off Naomi, and I felt an arm lace around my waist before feeling a kiss on my cheek, quite close to the corner of my lips which made me feel warm inside. I turned and saw Brie smiling by my side. Saved by the bell, I guess. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Hey,&rdquo; I said, returning the smile, also trying not to laugh at Naomi&rsquo;s change in expression. &ldquo;Brie, these are my cousins. Naomi and Kieran.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I watched as Naomi and Kieran forced smiles on their faces and greeted Brie. I almost wanted to take a picture of this moment because it was too good. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"This is my girlfriend, Brie,&ldquo; I introduced her to them, giving them a knowing grin. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They didn&rsquo;t know what to say and I glanced at Brie, only to see her suppressing a laugh. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Nice meeting you, Brie, but my brother and I should get going,&rdquo; Naomi said as politely as she could muster. &ldquo;Bye.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brie waved with a grin on her lips, and when they both disappeared, I breathed out in relief before giving Brie a hug. She was surprised, but laughed and returned the hug. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"What was that for?&ldquo; she asked when I pulled away, a smile on her lips and a sparkle in her eyes. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Coming in when you did,&rdquo; I said, not quite letting go of her arms just yet. &ldquo;Naomi was about to bite my head off.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She rolled her eyes playfully. &ldquo;Typical Y/N. I leave you alone for two minutes.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I chuckled. &ldquo;Seriously, though. One conversation with them and I already want to kill them. I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re here with me.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Anytime,&ldquo; she said, giving me a knowing look. \"You&rsquo;ve got this.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I sighed, glancing around, looking at everyone we&rsquo;d have to greet otherwise my mum would kill me. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Yeah, I think I do,&ldquo; I said, nodding. \"Just don&rsquo;t leave me alone again please.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She laughed and intertwined our fingers, gently rocking our hands between us. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t, Y/N. I promise.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We walked a little, a silence settling between us, before I blurted out, &ldquo;You look really nice by the way.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brie smiled, but her cheeks flushed a little. &ldquo;Thanks&hellip; so do you. I was going to tell you earlier, but you were having a mental breakdown, so&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I breathed out, suppressing a smile. &ldquo;Sounds about right. But thanks.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I looked to her and saw her smiling to herself, only making me smile, too. I realised I quite liked the feeling of her hand in mine. </p><p>***</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"&hellip;and I want to thank you all for being here to celebrate with us this week,&ldquo; Isaac said, grinning at everybody in the marquee set up for the lunch. \"Y/M/N and I couldn&rsquo;t be any more happier to celebrate with all of our friends and family.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Everybody began to clap and cheer for the engaged couple, making Isaac pause momentarily. Brie and I joined in with the clapping, and admittedly, I smiled at Isaac and my mum, happy that they were happy. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Now, speaking of family, I know speeches are for the wedding reception, but I wanted to say something quick,&ldquo; he continued when the clapping came to a stop. His eyes fell on me, myself sat opposite him on the lead table. \"Y/N, I wanted to thank you for always being so supportive of your mother and I&rsquo;s relationship. It&rsquo;s very reassuring to know I have your approval and I&rsquo;m glad I can eventually call you my step-daughter. Thank you.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I smiled awkwardly, not appreciating the attention of everyone in the room on me right now. People clapped and some began to chant &ldquo;speech! speech!&rdquo; making me widen my eyes. Hell to the no. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You want to make a speech?&ldquo; Isaac asked, a hopeful glint in his eyes as he held out the microphone. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Er&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Go on, Y/N, you got this,&ldquo; Brie encouraged, grinning beside me, before grabbing my hand and squeezing gently. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not really having a choice, I stood up and accepted the microphone, watching as Isaac took his seat and everybody went quiet. All eyes were on me and I felt Brie letting go of my hand, but I pulled it back, intertwining our fingers. Moral support was good right now, and she made me feel a lot better. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Erm, well, as Isaac said, speeches are usually for the wedding reception, so I don&rsquo;t really have anything prepared,&rdquo; I joked awkwardly, which thankfully gained a few laughs. &ldquo;I guess, thank you for all showing up. It&rsquo;s great to see so many of you again and catch up. We&rsquo;re all here to celebrate the same thing &ndash; my mum and Isaac&rsquo;s engagement.&rdquo; I looked to them both, before settling my gaze on Isaac. &ldquo;Isaac, I couldn&rsquo;t have asked for a better man to marry my mum. You make her happy and I&rsquo;m grateful. It&rsquo;s an honour to eventually be your step-daughter. So thank <i>you</i>.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I awkwardly turned off the mic and placed it on the table, sitting back down as people clapped. Isaac looked over the moon with my words which warmed my heart. He tried hard in the early stages of our relationship and it was obvious he still sought my approval. He already had it. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You did amazing,&ldquo; Brie leaned forward and muttered in my ear, a smile on her lips. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Thanks,&rdquo; I said, squeezing her hand and resting my other hand on our intertwined ones. I was getting used to having her next to me that I didn&rsquo;t even think twice about having to pretend to be her girlfriend. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I&rsquo;d like to add one more thing, since we&rsquo;re all giving mini speeches now,&ldquo; my mum&rsquo;s voice pulled me from my thoughts, and I looked up to see her stood up with the mic in hand. Oh, no&hellip; \"Firstly, thank you all for coming this week! Isaac and I are truly grateful for your support.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;More clapping whilst I froze, worried about what my mother would say. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I&rsquo;m lucky to be surrounded by people I love and who love me,&ldquo; she continued, before settling her gaze on me. \"Including having my wonderful daughter, Y/N, here. She doesn&rsquo;t realise this but having her here means the world to me.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Everybody 'aww&rsquo;d&rsquo; whilst I tried to stop my face from looking confused. Was she serious? </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Y/N even brought her girlfriend, Brie, with her,&ldquo; she said, motioning to Brie beside me, making my cheeks heat up because of all the attention from the guests. \"If you haven&rsquo;t met her already, introduce yourself. She&rsquo;s lovely and I couldn&rsquo;t have asked for anyone else to be with my daughter.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Mum, you really don&rsquo;t need to&ndash;\"</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Thank you for making her happy, Brie,&ldquo; my mum ignored me, looking to Brie. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brie looked as red as I felt, smiling awkwardly as all eyes were on her. She cleared her throat, but didn&rsquo;t know what to say. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Here&rsquo;s to love,&rdquo; my mum finished, raising her glass in the form of a toast. &ldquo;Whether that be platonic or romantic. We should all appreciate it when we have it.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Everybody raised there glasses, so Brie and I kind of had to otherwise it would look weird. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Cheers!&ldquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I took a sip of my water before watching as my mum said her final thanks and left the mic. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"That was very&hellip; surprising,&rdquo; I said to my mum when she sat down. I let go of Brie&rsquo;s hand and leaned forward. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t need to say all of that.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Well, I meant every word,&ldquo; my mum said, smiling. \"I&rsquo;m proud of you. And I&rsquo;m happy for you.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I pursed my lips, not knowing how to respond. See, she said things like that once in a blue moon, but I never knew whether to believe it or not because next thing she&rsquo;d be doing is dragging me down for my career or life choices. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I looked to Brie, who was stuck into her food, completely oblivious and long forgotten to what just went down. When she felt me looking, she swallowed and raised an eyebrow. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You good?&ldquo; she asked adorably. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I forgot about my confusion and smiled. \"I am now.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She seemed confused, but shrugged and went back to her meal, making me realise this whole thing was easier than I thought. Being Brie&rsquo;s girlfriend. It made me question why she single in the first place.</p>",
