From the EW\narticle, we know that Sansa is not thrilled about what he has done \u2013 that\u2019s not\nsurprising considering Sansa has never supported any of Jon\u2019s decisions - except the one where he puts her in charge of the North. Jon and Sansa think too differently for them to agree on any one\nthing. Sansa wants the Starks to rule the North and Jon wants to defend the\nrealms of man from the AOTD. <br/></p><p>By bending the knee, Jon\nis following in the footsteps of another great Northern King, Torrhen Stark, the King who Knelt.\nTorrhen\u2019s decision was unpopular and some Northerners split off and formed rebel\nfactions. But his decision saved thousands of Northern lives from Aegon the Conqueror. Like Torrhen, Jon understands what is at stake here and makes a decision\nthat is going to get him a lot of hate.</p><p>Jon\u2019s arc is defined by\nunpopular decisions that go against the grain but is what he does because it is\nthe right thing to do. He ended an 8000 year\nold feud between the Freefolk and the Night\u2019s Watch. 8000 years! That should\ntell us how unpopular his decision to let the Wildlings past the wall was and\nwhy he got assassinated by angry crows. By marrying Alys Karstark to the Magnar of Thenns he has started integrating the freefolk into the North breaking customs and traditions that are thousands of years old. He is planning on building greenhouses to grow crops at the wall. And then we have all his mentors advising\nhim to stick to his goals, no matter how hard it is and telling him that the\nburden of leadership is not an easy one. </p><p><b>JON</b>: I need your advice.\n<b>There\u2019s something I want to do, something I have to do. But it\u2019ll divide the\nNight\u2019s Watch. Bitterly. Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order.</b><br/><br/><b>AEMON</b>: <b>Half the men hate you\nalready, Lord Commander.

The same counsel I once gave my brother when we parted for the last time.\nHe was three-and-thirty when the Great Council chose him to mount the Iron\nThrone. A man grown with sons of his own, yet in some ways still a boy. Egg had\nan innocence to him, a sweetness we all loved. <i>Kill the boy within you,</i>\nI told him the day I took ship for the Wall. <b><i>It takes a man to rule. An Aegon, not an Egg. Kill the boy and let\nthe man be born.</i></b>You are half\nthe age that Egg was, <b>and your own burden is crueler one, I fear.

But it&rsquo;ll divide the\nNight&rsquo;s Watch. Bitterly. Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order.</b><br /><br /><b>AEMON</b>: <b>Half the men hate you\nalready, Lord Commander. Do it.<br /></b><br /><b>JON</b>: But you don&rsquo;t know what it is.<br /><br /><b>AEMON</b>: <b>That doesn&rsquo;t matter. You do. You will find little joy in your\ncommand. But with luck, you will find the strength to do what needs to be done.</b>\nKill the boy, Jon Snow. Winter is almost upon us. Kill the boy, and let the man\nbe born.</p><p><b>AEMON:</b> &ldquo;Allow\nme to give my lord one last piece of counsel. The same counsel I once gave my brother when we parted for the last time.\nHe was three-and-thirty when the Great Council chose him to mount the Iron\nThrone. A man grown with sons of his own, yet in some ways still a boy. Egg had\nan innocence to him, a sweetness we all loved. <i>Kill the boy within you,</i>\nI told him the day I took ship for the Wall. <b><i>It takes a man to rule. An Aegon, not an Egg. Kill the boy and let\nthe man be born.</i></b>You are half\nthe age that Egg was, <b>and your own burden is crueler one, I fear. You will have\nlittle joy of your command,</b> <b>but I think\nyou have the strength in you to do the things that must be done</b>. Kill the\nboy, Jon Snow. Winter is almost upon us. Kill the boy and let the man be born.&rdquo;\n<br /><b><br /></b></p><p><b>ALLISER THORNE</b> <i>: I </i>fought<i>,\nI </i>lost<i>. Now I rest. </i><b>But you<i>,\n</i>Lord Snow<i>, </i>you<i>&rsquo;ll\nbe </i>fighting their battles forever<i>.</i></b></p><p><b>ALLISER THORNE </b>:\n<b>Do you know what leadership means</b>, Lord Snow? It means that\nthe person in charge gets second-guessed by every clever little twat with a\nmouth. <b>But if he starts second-guessing himself, that&rsquo;s the end. For him, for\nthe clever little twat, for everyone. </b></p><p><b>BERIC\nDONDARRION</b> : &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s our purpose to understand.\nExcept one thing &mdash; we&rsquo;re soldiers. We have to know what we&rsquo;re fighting for. <b>I&rsquo;m not fighting so some man or woman I\nbarely know can sit on a throne made of swords&hellip;[I&rsquo;m fighting for] life.</b>\nDeath is the enemy. The first enemy and the last&hellip;The enemy always wins. And we\nstill need to fight him. That&rsquo;s all I know. <b>You and I won&rsquo;t find much joy while\nwe&rsquo;re here, but we can keep others alive. We can defend those who can&rsquo;t defend\nthemselves&hellip;Maybe we don&rsquo;t need to understand any more than that. Maybe that&rsquo;s\nenough.&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>DAVOS SEAWORTH:</b> You go on. You fight for\nas long as you can. You clean up as much of the shit as you can.</p><p><b>JON SNOW:</b> I don&rsquo;t know how to do that. I\nthought I did, but&hellip; I failed.</p><p><b>DAVOS SEAWORTH: Good. Now go fail again.</b></p><p><b>THEON GREYJOY</b>: &ldquo;What you did in King&rsquo;s Landing, what\nyou said, you could have lied to Cersei, about bending the knee to Daenarys. <b>You risked everything to tell an enemy the\ntruth.</b>&rdquo; </p><p><b>JON SNOW</b>: &ldquo;We went down there to make peace and <b>it seems to me that we need to be honest\nwith each other if we&rsquo;re ever going to fight together.&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>THEON GREYJOY</b>: &ldquo;<b>You&rsquo;ve always known what was right.</b>\nEven when we were all young and stupid. You always knew. Every step you take,\nit&rsquo;s always the right step.&rdquo;</p><p>(Damn, writing this makes me want to write a\nlittle bit about all of Jon&rsquo;s mentors and teachers in both the books and show.\nThere are so many of them and each of them have given Jon so much good advice.\nOut of all the characters in the books, Jon really lucked out in terms of\nteachers.)</p><p>In conclusion, Jon Snow&rsquo;s arc has been about him\ndoing the right thing, no matter how unpopular that decision is. To defend the\nrealms of men. He is still going to do what he thinks is right, even if the likes\nof Glover and Royce complain and whine about him bending the knee. And it&rsquo;s\nclear from the EW article that we are going to see a repeat of the episode &lsquo;<i>Hardhome</i>&rsquo;\nwhere the crows and wildlings argue amongst themselves and then unite when the\nAOTD attacks the encampment. </p><blockquote><p>Instead of King Robert&rsquo;s procession arriving, it&rsquo;s Daenerys and her army.\n<b>What follows is a thrilling and tense intermingling of characters</b> &mdash; some of\nwhom have never previously met, many who have messy histories &mdash; as they all\nprepare to face the inevitable invasion of the Army of the Dead.</p><p>&ldquo;<b>It&rsquo;s about all of these disparate characters\ncoming together to face a common enemy, dealing with their own past, and\ndefining the person they want to be in the face of certain death,&rdquo;</b>\nco-executive producer Bryan Cogman says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an incredibly emotional,\nhaunting, bittersweet final season, and I think it honors very much what George\nset out to do &mdash; which is flipping this kind of story on its head.&rdquo;</p><p><b>How these fan favorites get along\ndrives much of the drama this season </b>(okay, here&rsquo;s one specific tease from\nthe premiere &mdash; Sansa isn&rsquo;t thrilled that Jon bent the knee to his fancy new\nTargaryen girlfriend, at least not at first).</p><p><b>The drama builds to a confrontation\nwith the Army of the Dead </b>that&rsquo;s expected to be the most sustained action\nsequence ever made for television or film. One episode &mdash; the same that Benioff\nand Weiss were concerned about pulling off so many years ago &mdash; is wall-to-wall\naction, courtesy of &ldquo;Battle of the Bastards&rdquo; director Miguel Sapochnik.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/2018/11/01/game-of-thrones-final-season-ew-cover-story/\">https://ew.com/tv/2018/11/01/game-of-thrones-final-season-ew-cover-story/</a></p><p>I expect everyone to be arguing about Jon bending the\nknee and the politics of who rules whom until the AOTD reaches their doorstep\nand then folks finally understand what Jon has been telling them about for\n3 seasons now. And then, like the Thenn in\n<i>Hardhome </i>who first calls Jon the enemy and then fights alongside him, we will\nsee these groups finally come together and unite against the common foe. </p>",

        "body": "<p>\u201cJon!\u201d Arya screeched from the back. \u201cWhat are you doing\nhere? Where\u2019s Robb?\u201d<br/><br/>\nJon turned to look at Arya. \u201cHe and I were\nhanging out, but he\u2019d had a few beers when you texted, and you know I don\u2019t\u2014well,\nnot since\u2014\u201d He swallowed strongly. \u201cAnyway, I said I\u2019d come pick you up. Robb\nlent me his car.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><!-- more --><p><br/><br/></p><p>\u201cWhat\nhappened to yours?\u201d Sansa almost said, and might have, had she not been so overwhelmed\nwith shock at seeing him beside her.</p><p><br/>\nJon moved his head back to face the steering wheel.\n\u201cHe only said Arya and Gendry. I didn\u2019t know\u2014\u201c he trailed off as his eyes\nflicked to Sansa.<br/><br/>\nOr he wouldn\u2019t have come, was the unspoken\nmessage.<br/><br/>\nSansa felt her heartbeat pick up with each\nsecond his eyes were on her. Although she was merrily dizzy with drunkenness\nonly a couple of minutes earlier, she felt as though someone had doused her in\nwater.\u00a0</p><p>She\ndidn\u2019t like the feeling of being under his gaze and not knowing what he was\nthinking. Sometimes, late at night when she couldn\u2019t sleep, she had imagined\nwhat it would be like to see Jon again \u2013 when he wasn\u2019t in a hospital bed. But in\nall her imaginings, she had never been drinking so heavily or so sweaty from\ndancing.</p><p>She\nresisted the urge to pat down her hair or swipe at the eyeliner she was sure had\nsmudged. There was no need to look nice for him anymore, she reminded herself. Keeping her eyes glued forward, she wrestled with her\nseatbelt until it finally clicked.<br/><br/>\n\u201cSeatbelts back there?\u201d<br/><br/>\nGendry and Arya murmured and groaned, but a few\nmoments later after some rustling and giggles Gendry grunted that they were\ngood.<br/><br/>\nJon nodded. \u201cGood. Safety first.\u201d He sighed.\n\u201cI\u2019ll just, drive you home then.\u201d<br/><br/>\nFor all the talk of fries and burgers, neither\nArya nor Gendry mentioned anything about the Ice Shack, for which Sansa was\ngrateful. She didn\u2019t want to do anything to make this trip any longer than it\nhad to be. She also could not stomach the thought of eating anything now, when\nher entire body felt like it had been taken over with nerves.<br/><br/>\nBut even though she was glad there was no talk\nof the Ice Shack, she was more anxious about the lack of talk altogether. From\na quick peek into the back seat, she discovered that Arya was all but asleep as\nshe rested against Gendry\u2019s shoulder, and he was practically snoring.<br/><br/>\nThe traitors. Sleeping while she had to deal\nwith Jon alone in the front. She wished she could feign sleep and join them,\nbut her fidgeting hands would give her away.<br/><br/>\nFor a few minutes, Sansa sat stiffly, determined\nnot to look at Jon or speak. It was terribly rude. But she couldn\u2019t think of\nanything to say that didn\u2019t make her angry or tearful. And when should she be\nthe one to speak? To make him feel less awkward? She desperately didn\u2019t want to\ncare what he felt.<br/><br/>\nBy the fidgeting of her hands, she knew she was\ngoing to break soon, but then Jon spoke first when they settled in behind a\nline of cars at a light.

Sansa smoothed out the hem of her skirt and wished that it covered more\nof her thighs. \u201cHow was yours?\u201d Politeness forced her to ask.<br/><br/>\n\u201cGood,\u201d replies Jon, tapping against the wheel\nand staring at the traffic in front of them. \u201cQuiet,\u201d he added. \u201cWith just me\nand Mom.\u201d<br/><br/>\nIn the past, Sansa might have taken the initiative\nto invite Jon and his mom over, but the heavy silence between them seemed to\nsuggest that they both knew that was no longer a real option.<br/><br/>\n\u201cIt was good to see Robb tonight,\u201d Jon\ncontinued. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been the best at keeping in touch.

I\u2019ve wondered\u2014Arya, she tells\nme little bits and pieces, but never\u2014\u201c<br/><br/>\nHe was looking at her, really looking at her\nnow. And Sansa could not help but to turn and look back at him.<br/><br/>\nThe sight made her catch her breath, because\neven after all these years he was still Jon.<br/><br/>\nStill wearing black and smelling too good. In\nthe years since she had seen him, he had filled out. He\u2019d never been that\nscrawny, but she could tell that there was more muscle to him, even underneath\nall his layers. He was wearing a coat she recognized as Robb\u2019s, and she could\nnot help but wonder\u2014despite herself\u2014what had happened to the jacket she\u2019d\ngifted him so many years ago.</p><p>She looked to his face to chase the thought away.</p><p>His hair was tied back into a bun. Sansa had always been\nsomewhat indifferent to that fashion trend on men, but, maddeningly, on Jon it\nnot only worked\u2014it was dead attractive. It drew attention to his cheekbones and\nhis eyes, which were tired, but nevertheless soft and pleading.<br/><br/>\nSansa looked away. \u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d she said finally.\n\u201cI like school. I have nice friends.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d<br/><br/>\nShe frowned. She hated that she still cared\nabout his opinion. Her life at school was so separate from her life at home; it\nwas something of her own that she\u2019d fought for. Her time at Riverrun was proof\nthat she was no longer the stupid, trusting girl she was. And yet, here she was\nsitting in a car with Jon.</p><p>She wished Gilly,\u00a0 Meera, or Brienne were here to bring\nher strength and wisdom and to remind her of the woman she\u2019d become.\u00a0<br/><br/>\nShe turned to study the traffic and wondered how\nthere could still possibly be so many cars on the road this late. Perhaps many\nother people had gone out drinking; she\u2019d read once that the holidays were\nhorrible for bringing out alcoholic tendencies. Perhaps because they reminded\npeople of things from their past they\u2019d rather forget.<br/><br/>\nThey were stuck at another light. \u201cWhat are you\nstudying?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cPolitics and, uh, Gender Studies. I\u2019m hoping to\ngo to law school actually.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cReally?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, a bit defensively, even though he\nsounded more surprised than dismissive.<br/><br/>\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s really great, Sansa. I\u2019m happy\nyou\u2019re\u2014\u201c<br/><br/>\nSansa stopped listening. In the backseat, both\nArya and Gendry were still dozing, and it was just too much to be in the car\nwith him, with the heat cranked up, and his voice so sweet.<br/><br/>\nThere was so much she wanted to ask him about\nthe past\u2014why he stopped talking to her, why he dated Ygritte, why he\u2019d led her\nto believe her cared about her only to suddenly forget her.<br/><br/>\nAnd, to her surprise, there were so many things she\nwanted to know about him now\u2014questions that perhaps she\u2019d been wondering but\nhad never allowed herself to ask truly. Had he left the army for good? What was\nhe planning to do next? Did he visit Ghost when she was gone?<br/><br/>\nAnd more personal still\u2014Had his wounds healed?\nHad he killed anyone when he was up North? What was it like to almost\ndie?\u00a0<br/><br/>\nAnd then\u2014Had he thought about her?\u00a0Why did\nSam know her name? Had Jon really written letters?<br/><br/>\nBut instead, she folded her hands nearly across\nher lap and thought of something Gilly once told her: <i>Someone else\u2019s bad past behavior doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t move forward.</i><i><br/></i><br/>\nThey pulled up the her house.<br/><br/>\nSansa turned to Jon and cut off whatever he was\nsaying. \u201cThank you very much for the ride. I\u2019m sorry to have inconvenienced\nyou.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a\u2014\u201c<br/><br/>\nBut Sansa was already out of the car. She opened\nthe door to the backseat. \u201cWake up,\u201d she said, forcefully, but not unkindly, as\nshe leaned over Gendry to prod Arya on the shoulder.\u00a0<br/><br/>\nHer little sister opened her eyes slowly and\ngave her a tired smile. </p><p>\u201cYou\nhave to get up,\u201d Sansa said, but Arya didn\u2019t seem to have understood her.<br/><br/>\n\u201cSansa, you\u2019re so pretty. You could be a princess\u2014or\na queen\u2014like Alysanne from <i>A Dance wi\u2014</i>\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cThank you, but now isn\u2019t the time. You\u2019ve got\nto get up.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cI\u2019ll help,\u201d Jon said from behind.<br/><br/>\nSansa tried not to show how startled she\u2019d been\nthat he appeared so close to her and quickly moved out of his way.<br/><br/>\n\u201cJon!\u201d Arya chirped. \u201cWhen did you get here?\nDon\u2019t you think Sansa is pretty?\u201d\u00a0<br/><br/>\nSansa went to the other side of the car to avoid\nhearing his answer. She opened the passenger door and started grabbing Arya to\nget her out.\u00a0<br/><br/>\n\u201cOuch! Your fingers are so bony!\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cThat\u2019s from all the knitting!\u201d Sansa grumbled.\n\u201cC\u2019mon!\u201d<br/><br/>\nShe yanked Arya out of the car at the same time\nJon was hoisting out Gendry.<br/><br/>\nIt was slow moving up the driveway and around\nthe path, but after a few minutes, Sansa had Arya propped against the front\ndoor and was only slightly sweating beneath her heavy winter coat. She fumbled\nwith her keys, the sound of Jon behind her and grunting underneath Gendry\u2019s\nweight making her lose her concentration.<br/><br/>\nAt last, she got the door unlocked and open. She\npushed Arya through and made room for Jon to do the same for Gendry.\u00a0<br/><br/>\nSansa would have very much liked to have closed\nthe door as soon as they were all inside, but she couldn\u2019t do something so rude\nafter he\u2019d come out in the cold to get them past three and the morning and had physically\nlugged Gendry out of the car. Sansa spent thirty minutes on the elliptical a\nfew times a week, but she was not strong enough to have handled both Arya and\nGendry in drunken stupors on her own.<br/><br/>\nSo instead she lingered at the threshold, one\nfoot inside, one outside. \u201cThank you for your help,\u201d she told him.\u00a0<br/><br/>\nJon shoved his hands into his pockets. A lock of\nhair had escaped his bun and had fallen into his eyes.<br/><br/>\n\u201cIt was no problem, Sansa. It\u2014it was nice to see\nyou.\u201d<br/><br/>\nHe studied her face with an expression she\ncouldn\u2019t understand, and after a moment, gave a curt nod and turned to go.<br/><br/>\n\u201cJon!\u201d she took a step forward into the night\nair and called out to him without meaning to.<br/><br/>\nHe spun around.<br/><br/>\n\u201cI\u2014I met a friend of yours at school. Samwell\nTarly.\u201d The words were out of her mouth before she could think to take them\nback.<br/><br/>\nJon blinked. \u201cSamwell Tarly? How\u2014he\u2014but he\u2019s\nwith the Watch still.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cHe got a few days leave.\u201d<br/><br/>\nJon frowned, the lines of his forehead furrowed.\nHe hadn\u2019t had such deep lines there when they\u2019d been in high school. \u201cBut\nwhy\u2019d\u2014\u201c<br/><br/>\n\u201cI\u2019m dating Sam\u2019s brother Dickon,\u201d she said,\ntrying to sound unaffected as she delivered the news; to her own ears, she just\nsounded squeaky.<br/><br/>\n\u201cOh,\u201d Jon replied. His face shifted from\nastonishment and confusion to something else. He opened his mouth, as if to ask\na question, but then closed it again.\u00a0<br/><br/>\n\u201cHe\u2014he said something about letters.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cSam loves old letters and books. Just like you.\nHe\u2019s always going on about a collection or something from medieval history\u2014\u201c<br/><br/>\n\u201cNo\u2014these were your letters. Letters that\nyou\u2014well, you\u2019d written to me.\u201d<br/><br/>\nJon frowned again, deeper this time. \u201cHe\nshouldn\u2019t have said anything to you about that.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cIs it true? Did you\u2014\u201c<br/><br/>\nJon cut her off with a look. \u201cYou should go\ninside, Sansa,\u201d he said gruffly.\u00a0<br/><br/>\nShe crossed her arms over her chest, showing no\nindication of leaving until he gave her answer. </p><p>Jon sighed, and when he spoke, he sounded tired. \u201cWhen I\nfirst joined the Watch, I was feeling homesick. Reception is really bad that\nfar up north, so I used to write letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo me?\u201d Sansa pressed.</p><p>Jon\u2019s shoulders sagged. \u201cIn a sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what that means,\u201d Sansa replied, voicing her thoughts\naloud. </p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d he sighed and gave her a look that made her heart\ndrop. \u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d Jon replied with more softness in his voice. \u201cAnd you\u2019re\ndrunk.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cBut, I\u2014\u201c<br/><br/>\nHe gave her a little smile. \u201cIt really was nice\nto see you. Good night, Sansa.\u201d<br/><br/>\nAnd then he turned, walked back to Robb\u2019s car,\nand drove into the night.</p>",

I didn\u2019t know\u2014\u201c he trailed off as his eyes\nflicked to Sansa.<br><br>\nOr he wouldn\u2019t have come, was the unspoken\nmessage.<br><br>\nSansa felt her heartbeat pick up with each\nsecond his eyes were on her. Although she was merrily dizzy with drunkenness\nonly a couple of minutes earlier, she felt as though someone had doused her in\nwater.\u00a0</p><p>She\ndidn\u2019t like the feeling of being under his gaze and not knowing what he was\nthinking. Sometimes, late at night when she couldn\u2019t sleep, she had imagined\nwhat it would be like to see Jon again \u2013 when he wasn\u2019t in a hospital bed. But in\nall her imaginings, she had never been drinking so heavily or so sweaty from\ndancing.</p><p>She\nresisted the urge to pat down her hair or swipe at the eyeliner she was sure had\nsmudged. There was no need to look nice for him anymore, she reminded herself. Keeping her eyes glued forward, she wrestled with her\nseatbelt until it finally clicked.<br><br>\n\u201cSeatbelts back there?\u201d<br><br>\nGendry and Arya murmured and groaned, but a few\nmoments later after some rustling and giggles Gendry grunted that they were\ngood.<br><br>\nJon nodded. \u201cGood.

She didn\u2019t want to do anything to make this trip any longer than it\nhad to be. She also could not stomach the thought of eating anything now, when\nher entire body felt like it had been taken over with nerves.<br><br>\nBut even though she was glad there was no talk\nof the Ice Shack, she was more anxious about the lack of talk altogether. From\na quick peek into the back seat, she discovered that Arya was all but asleep as\nshe rested against Gendry\u2019s shoulder, and he was practically snoring.<br><br>\nThe traitors.

Where\u2019s Robb?\u201d<br><br>\nJon turned to look at Arya. \u201cHe and I were\nhanging out, but he\u2019d had a few beers when you texted, and you know I don\u2019t\u2014well,\nnot since\u2014\u201d He swallowed strongly. \u201cAnyway, I said I\u2019d come pick you up. Robb\nlent me his car.\u201d</p><p><br></p>[[MORE]]<p><br><br></p><p>\u201cWhat\nhappened to yours?\u201d Sansa almost said, and might have, had she not been so overwhelmed\nwith shock at seeing him beside her.</p><p><br>\nJon moved his head back to face the steering wheel.\n\u201cHe only said Arya and Gendry. I didn\u2019t know\u2014\u201c he trailed off as his eyes\nflicked to Sansa.<br><br>\nOr he wouldn\u2019t have come, was the unspoken\nmessage.<br><br>\nSansa felt her heartbeat pick up with each\nsecond his eyes were on her. Although she was merrily dizzy with drunkenness\nonly a couple of minutes earlier, she felt as though someone had doused her in\nwater.\u00a0</p><p>She\ndidn\u2019t like the feeling of being under his gaze and not knowing what he was\nthinking. Sometimes, late at night when she couldn\u2019t sleep, she had imagined\nwhat it would be like to see Jon again \u2013 when he wasn\u2019t in a hospital bed. But in\nall her imaginings, she had never been drinking so heavily or so sweaty from\ndancing.</p><p>She\nresisted the urge to pat down her hair or swipe at the eyeliner she was sure had\nsmudged. There was no need to look nice for him anymore, she reminded herself. Keeping her eyes glued forward, she wrestled with her\nseatbelt until it finally clicked.<br><br>\n\u201cSeatbelts back there?\u201d<br><br>\nGendry and Arya murmured and groaned, but a few\nmoments later after some rustling and giggles Gendry grunted that they were\ngood.<br><br>\nJon nodded. \u201cGood. Safety first.\u201d He sighed.\n\u201cI\u2019ll just, drive you home then.\u201d<br><br>\nFor all the talk of fries and burgers, neither\nArya nor Gendry mentioned anything about the Ice Shack, for which Sansa was\ngrateful. She didn\u2019t want to do anything to make this trip any longer than it\nhad to be. She also could not stomach the thought of eating anything now, when\nher entire body felt like it had been taken over with nerves.<br><br>\nBut even though she was glad there was no talk\nof the Ice Shack, she was more anxious about the lack of talk altogether. From\na quick peek into the back seat, she discovered that Arya was all but asleep as\nshe rested against Gendry\u2019s shoulder, and he was practically snoring.<br><br>\nThe traitors. Sleeping while she had to deal\nwith Jon alone in the front. She wished she could feign sleep and join them,\nbut her fidgeting hands would give her away.<br><br>\nFor a few minutes, Sansa sat stiffly, determined\nnot to look at Jon or speak. It was terribly rude. But she couldn\u2019t think of\nanything to say that didn\u2019t make her angry or tearful. And when should she be\nthe one to speak? To make him feel less awkward? She desperately didn\u2019t want to\ncare what he felt.<br><br>\nBy the fidgeting of her hands, she knew she was\ngoing to break soon, but then Jon spoke first when they settled in behind a\nline of cars at a light. His voice was so soft she would have missed it, had\nnot she been so tense and aware of his every movement.<br><br>\n\u201cDid you have a nice Thanksgiving?\u201d<br><br></p><p>She\ncouldn\u2019t answer for a moment\u2014surprised by how mundane the question was. But\nthen, strangely, she thought about a networking event she had attended and the\nadvice Cersei Lannister, one of the most formidable professors she had ever\nknown, had given her about dealing with men you\u2019d rather avoid: <i>Never let them see your weakness. Be a pretty\nbird for them all to gaze upon and try to encage. Then, when it\u2019s time, gauge\nout their eyes and fly away.</i></p><p>She\u2019d\nthought it was rather pessimistic advice\u2014from a woman who\u2019d always struck her\nas embittered. But there was some truth to it, even if she didn\u2019t like it.\nSansa would never again be a little dove, the way Cersei would have liked, but\nshe could be strong, and over the years, she had been getting better at masking\nher feelings and at wearing her courtesy like knights wore steel.</p><p>\u201cYes, it was very nice,\u201d she said in a clipped, but courteous\nvoice. Sansa smoothed out the hem of her skirt and wished that it covered more\nof her thighs. \u201cHow was yours?\u201d Politeness forced her to ask.<br><br>\n\u201cGood,\u201d replies Jon, tapping against the wheel\nand staring at the traffic in front of them. \u201cQuiet,\u201d he added. \u201cWith just me\nand Mom.\u201d<br><br>\nIn the past, Sansa might have taken the initiative\nto invite Jon and his mom over, but the heavy silence between them seemed to\nsuggest that they both knew that was no longer a real option.<br><br>\n\u201cIt was good to see Robb tonight,\u201d Jon\ncontinued. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been the best at keeping in touch. He\u2019s\u2014he\u2019s had a lot\ngoing on.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cA baby on the way,\u201d Sansa almost wanted to\nstay, but instead she just hummed noncommittally.<br><br>\nAs the cars ahead of them began to move, they\nreached the intersection just as the light switched from yellow to red.<br><br>\n\u201cHow\u2014how are you? I\u2019ve wondered\u2014Arya, she tells\nme little bits and pieces, but never\u2014\u201c<br><br>\nHe was looking at her, really looking at her\nnow. And Sansa could not help but to turn and look back at him.<br><br>\nThe sight made her catch her breath, because\neven after all these years he was still Jon.<br><br>\nStill wearing black and smelling too good. In\nthe years since she had seen him, he had filled out. He\u2019d never been that\nscrawny, but she could tell that there was more muscle to him, even underneath\nall his layers. He was wearing a coat she recognized as Robb\u2019s, and she could\nnot help but wonder\u2014despite herself\u2014what had happened to the jacket she\u2019d\ngifted him so many years ago.</p><p>She looked to his face to chase the thought away.</p><p>His hair was tied back into a bun. Sansa had always been\nsomewhat indifferent to that fashion trend on men, but, maddeningly, on Jon it\nnot only worked\u2014it was dead attractive. It drew attention to his cheekbones and\nhis eyes, which were tired, but nevertheless soft and pleading.<br><br>\nSansa looked away. \u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d she said finally.\n\u201cI like school. I have nice friends.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d<br><br>\nShe frowned. She hated that she still cared\nabout his opinion. Her life at school was so separate from her life at home; it\nwas something of her own that she\u2019d fought for. Her time at Riverrun was proof\nthat she was no longer the stupid, trusting girl she was. And yet, here she was\nsitting in a car with Jon.</p><p>She wished Gilly,\u00a0 Meera, or Brienne were here to bring\nher strength and wisdom and to remind her of the woman she\u2019d become.\u00a0<br><br>\nShe turned to study the traffic and wondered how\nthere could still possibly be so many cars on the road this late. Perhaps many\nother people had gone out drinking; she\u2019d read once that the holidays were\nhorrible for bringing out alcoholic tendencies. Perhaps because they reminded\npeople of things from their past they\u2019d rather forget.<br><br>\nThey were stuck at another light. \u201cWhat are you\nstudying?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cPolitics and, uh, Gender Studies. I\u2019m hoping to\ngo to law school actually.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cReally?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, a bit defensively, even though he\nsounded more surprised than dismissive.<br><br>\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s really great, Sansa. I\u2019m happy\nyou\u2019re\u2014\u201c<br><br>\nSansa stopped listening. In the backseat, both\nArya and Gendry were still dozing, and it was just too much to be in the car\nwith him, with the heat cranked up, and his voice so sweet.<br><br>\nThere was so much she wanted to ask him about\nthe past\u2014why he stopped talking to her, why he dated Ygritte, why he\u2019d led her\nto believe her cared about her only to suddenly forget her.<br><br>\nAnd, to her surprise, there were so many things she\nwanted to know about him now\u2014questions that perhaps she\u2019d been wondering but\nhad never allowed herself to ask truly. Had he left the army for good? What was\nhe planning to do next? Did he visit Ghost when she was gone?<br><br>\nAnd more personal still\u2014Had his wounds healed?\nHad he killed anyone when he was up North? What was it like to almost\ndie?\u00a0<br><br>\nAnd then\u2014Had he thought about her?\u00a0Why did\nSam know her name? Had Jon really written letters?<br><br>\nBut instead, she folded her hands nearly across\nher lap and thought of something Gilly once told her: <i>Someone else\u2019s bad past behavior doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t move forward.</i><i><br></i><br>\nThey pulled up the her house.<br><br>\nSansa turned to Jon and cut off whatever he was\nsaying. \u201cThank you very much for the ride. I\u2019m sorry to have inconvenienced\nyou.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a\u2014\u201c<br><br>\nBut Sansa was already out of the car. She opened\nthe door to the backseat. \u201cWake up,\u201d she said, forcefully, but not unkindly, as\nshe leaned over Gendry to prod Arya on the shoulder.\u00a0<br><br>\nHer little sister opened her eyes slowly and\ngave her a tired smile. </p><p>\u201cYou\nhave to get up,\u201d Sansa said, but Arya didn\u2019t seem to have understood her.<br><br>\n\u201cSansa, you\u2019re so pretty. You could be a princess\u2014or\na queen\u2014like Alysanne from <i>A Dance wi\u2014</i>\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cThank you, but now isn\u2019t the time. You\u2019ve got\nto get up.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI\u2019ll help,\u201d Jon said from behind.<br><br>\nSansa tried not to show how startled she\u2019d been\nthat he appeared so close to her and quickly moved out of his way.<br><br>\n\u201cJon!\u201d Arya chirped. \u201cWhen did you get here?\nDon\u2019t you think Sansa is pretty?\u201d\u00a0<br><br>\nSansa went to the other side of the car to avoid\nhearing his answer. She opened the passenger door and started grabbing Arya to\nget her out.\u00a0<br><br>\n\u201cOuch! Your fingers are so bony!\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cThat\u2019s from all the knitting!\u201d Sansa grumbled.\n\u201cC\u2019mon!\u201d<br><br>\nShe yanked Arya out of the car at the same time\nJon was hoisting out Gendry.<br><br>\nIt was slow moving up the driveway and around\nthe path, but after a few minutes, Sansa had Arya propped against the front\ndoor and was only slightly sweating beneath her heavy winter coat. She fumbled\nwith her keys, the sound of Jon behind her and grunting underneath Gendry\u2019s\nweight making her lose her concentration.<br><br>\nAt last, she got the door unlocked and open. She\npushed Arya through and made room for Jon to do the same for Gendry.\u00a0<br><br>\nSansa would have very much liked to have closed\nthe door as soon as they were all inside, but she couldn\u2019t do something so rude\nafter he\u2019d come out in the cold to get them past three and the morning and had physically\nlugged Gendry out of the car.

A lock of\nhair had escaped his bun and had fallen into his eyes.<br><br>\n\u201cIt was no problem, Sansa. It\u2014it was nice to see\nyou.\u201d<br><br>\nHe studied her face with an expression she\ncouldn\u2019t understand, and after a moment, gave a curt nod and turned to go.<br><br>\n\u201cJon!\u201d she took a step forward into the night\nair and called out to him without meaning to.<br><br>\nHe spun around.<br><br>\n\u201cI\u2014I met a friend of yours at school.

I didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;&ldquo; he trailed off as his eyes\nflicked to Sansa.<br /><br />\nOr he wouldn&rsquo;t have come, was the unspoken\nmessage.<br /><br />\nSansa felt her heartbeat pick up with each\nsecond his eyes were on her. Although she was merrily dizzy with drunkenness\nonly a couple of minutes earlier, she felt as though someone had doused her in\nwater.&nbsp;</p><p>She\ndidn&rsquo;t like the feeling of being under his gaze and not knowing what he was\nthinking. Sometimes, late at night when she couldn&rsquo;t sleep, she had imagined\nwhat it would be like to see Jon again &ndash; when he wasn&rsquo;t in a hospital bed. But in\nall her imaginings, she had never been drinking so heavily or so sweaty from\ndancing.</p><p>She\nresisted the urge to pat down her hair or swipe at the eyeliner she was sure had\nsmudged. There was no need to look nice for him anymore, she reminded herself. Keeping her eyes glued forward, she wrestled with her\nseatbelt until it finally clicked.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Seatbelts back there?&rdquo;<br /><br />\nGendry and Arya murmured and groaned, but a few\nmoments later after some rustling and giggles Gendry grunted that they were\ngood.<br /><br />\nJon nodded. &ldquo;Good. Safety first.&rdquo; He sighed.\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just, drive you home then.&rdquo;<br /><br />\nFor all the talk of fries and burgers, neither\nArya nor Gendry mentioned anything about the Ice Shack, for which Sansa was\ngrateful. She didn&rsquo;t want to do anything to make this trip any longer than it\nhad to be. She also could not stomach the thought of eating anything now, when\nher entire body felt like it had been taken over with nerves.<br /><br />\nBut even though she was glad there was no talk\nof the Ice Shack, she was more anxious about the lack of talk altogether. From\na quick peek into the back seat, she discovered that Arya was all but asleep as\nshe rested against Gendry&rsquo;s shoulder, and he was practically snoring.<br /><br />\nThe traitors. Sleeping while she had to deal\nwith Jon alone in the front. She wished she could feign sleep and join them,\nbut her fidgeting hands would give her away.<br /><br />\nFor a few minutes, Sansa sat stiffly, determined\nnot to look at Jon or speak. It was terribly rude. But she couldn&rsquo;t think of\nanything to say that didn&rsquo;t make her angry or tearful. And when should she be\nthe one to speak? To make him feel less awkward? She desperately didn&rsquo;t want to\ncare what he felt.<br /><br />\nBy the fidgeting of her hands, she knew she was\ngoing to break soon, but then Jon spoke first when they settled in behind a\nline of cars at a light. His voice was so soft she would have missed it, had\nnot she been so tense and aware of his every movement.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Did you have a nice Thanksgiving?&rdquo;<br /><br /></p><p>She\ncouldn&rsquo;t answer for a moment&mdash;surprised by how mundane the question was. But\nthen, strangely, she thought about a networking event she had attended and the\nadvice Cersei Lannister, one of the most formidable professors she had ever\nknown, had given her about dealing with men you&rsquo;d rather avoid: <i>Never let them see your weakness. Be a pretty\nbird for them all to gaze upon and try to encage. Then, when it&rsquo;s time, gauge\nout their eyes and fly away.</i></p><p>She&rsquo;d\nthought it was rather pessimistic advice&mdash;from a woman who&rsquo;d always struck her\nas embittered. But there was some truth to it, even if she didn&rsquo;t like it.\nSansa would never again be a little dove, the way Cersei would have liked, but\nshe could be strong, and over the years, she had been getting better at masking\nher feelings and at wearing her courtesy like knights wore steel.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, it was very nice,&rdquo; she said in a clipped, but courteous\nvoice. Sansa smoothed out the hem of her skirt and wished that it covered more\nof her thighs. &ldquo;How was yours?&rdquo; Politeness forced her to ask.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; replies Jon, tapping against the wheel\nand staring at the traffic in front of them. &ldquo;Quiet,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;With just me\nand Mom.&rdquo;<br /><br />\nIn the past, Sansa might have taken the initiative\nto invite Jon and his mom over, but the heavy silence between them seemed to\nsuggest that they both knew that was no longer a real option.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;It was good to see Robb tonight,&rdquo; Jon\ncontinued. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t been the best at keeping in touch. He&rsquo;s&mdash;he&rsquo;s had a lot\ngoing on.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;A baby on the way,&rdquo; Sansa almost wanted to\nstay, but instead she just hummed noncommittally.<br /><br />\nAs the cars ahead of them began to move, they\nreached the intersection just as the light switched from yellow to red.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;How&mdash;how are you? I&rsquo;ve wondered&mdash;Arya, she tells\nme little bits and pieces, but never&mdash;&ldquo;<br /><br />\nHe was looking at her, really looking at her\nnow. And Sansa could not help but to turn and look back at him.<br /><br />\nThe sight made her catch her breath, because\neven after all these years he was still Jon.<br /><br />\nStill wearing black and smelling too good. In\nthe years since she had seen him, he had filled out. He&rsquo;d never been that\nscrawny, but she could tell that there was more muscle to him, even underneath\nall his layers. He was wearing a coat she recognized as Robb&rsquo;s, and she could\nnot help but wonder&mdash;despite herself&mdash;what had happened to the jacket she&rsquo;d\ngifted him so many years ago.</p><p>She looked to his face to chase the thought away.</p><p>His hair was tied back into a bun. Sansa had always been\nsomewhat indifferent to that fashion trend on men, but, maddeningly, on Jon it\nnot only worked&mdash;it was dead attractive. It drew attention to his cheekbones and\nhis eyes, which were tired, but nevertheless soft and pleading.<br /><br />\nSansa looked away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m good,&rdquo; she said finally.\n&ldquo;I like school. I have nice friends.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad.&rdquo;<br /><br />\nShe frowned. She hated that she still cared\nabout his opinion. Her life at school was so separate from her life at home; it\nwas something of her own that she&rsquo;d fought for. Her time at Riverrun was proof\nthat she was no longer the stupid, trusting girl she was. And yet, here she was\nsitting in a car with Jon.</p><p>She wished Gilly,&nbsp; Meera, or Brienne were here to bring\nher strength and wisdom and to remind her of the woman she&rsquo;d become.&nbsp;<br /><br />\nShe turned to study the traffic and wondered how\nthere could still possibly be so many cars on the road this late. Perhaps many\nother people had gone out drinking; she&rsquo;d read once that the holidays were\nhorrible for bringing out alcoholic tendencies. Perhaps because they reminded\npeople of things from their past they&rsquo;d rather forget.<br /><br />\nThey were stuck at another light. &ldquo;What are you\nstudying?&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Politics and, uh, Gender Studies. I&rsquo;m hoping to\ngo to law school actually.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, a bit defensively, even though he\nsounded more surprised than dismissive.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&mdash;that&rsquo;s really great, Sansa. I&rsquo;m happy\nyou&rsquo;re&mdash;&ldquo;<br /><br />\nSansa stopped listening. In the backseat, both\nArya and Gendry were still dozing, and it was just too much to be in the car\nwith him, with the heat cranked up, and his voice so sweet.<br /><br />\nThere was so much she wanted to ask him about\nthe past&mdash;why he stopped talking to her, why he dated Ygritte, why he&rsquo;d led her\nto believe her cared about her only to suddenly forget her.<br /><br />\nAnd, to her surprise, there were so many things she\nwanted to know about him now&mdash;questions that perhaps she&rsquo;d been wondering but\nhad never allowed herself to ask truly. Had he left the army for good? What was\nhe planning to do next? Did he visit Ghost when she was gone?<br /><br />\nAnd more personal still&mdash;Had his wounds healed?\nHad he killed anyone when he was up North? What was it like to almost\ndie?&nbsp;<br /><br />\nAnd then&mdash;Had he thought about her?&nbsp;Why did\nSam know her name? Had Jon really written letters?<br /><br />\nBut instead, she folded her hands nearly across\nher lap and thought of something Gilly once told her: <i>Someone else&rsquo;s bad past behavior doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t move forward.</i><i><br /></i><br />\nThey pulled up the her house.<br /><br />\nSansa turned to Jon and cut off whatever he was\nsaying. &ldquo;Thank you very much for the ride. I&rsquo;m sorry to have inconvenienced\nyou.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a&mdash;&ldquo;<br /><br />\nBut Sansa was already out of the car. She opened\nthe door to the backseat. &ldquo;Wake up,&rdquo; she said, forcefully, but not unkindly, as\nshe leaned over Gendry to prod Arya on the shoulder.&nbsp;<br /><br />\nHer little sister opened her eyes slowly and\ngave her a tired smile. </p><p>&ldquo;You\nhave to get up,&rdquo; Sansa said, but Arya didn&rsquo;t seem to have understood her.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Sansa, you&rsquo;re so pretty. You could be a princess&mdash;or\na queen&mdash;like Alysanne from <i>A Dance wi&mdash;</i>&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Thank you, but now isn&rsquo;t the time. You&rsquo;ve got\nto get up.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help,&rdquo; Jon said from behind.<br /><br />\nSansa tried not to show how startled she&rsquo;d been\nthat he appeared so close to her and quickly moved out of his way.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Jon!&rdquo; Arya chirped. &ldquo;When did you get here?\nDon&rsquo;t you think Sansa is pretty?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /><br />\nSansa went to the other side of the car to avoid\nhearing his answer. She opened the passenger door and started grabbing Arya to\nget her out.&nbsp;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Ouch! Your fingers are so bony!&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;That&rsquo;s from all the knitting!&rdquo; Sansa grumbled.\n&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon!&rdquo;<br /><br />\nShe yanked Arya out of the car at the same time\nJon was hoisting out Gendry.<br /><br />\nIt was slow moving up the driveway and around\nthe path, but after a few minutes, Sansa had Arya propped against the front\ndoor and was only slightly sweating beneath her heavy winter coat. She fumbled\nwith her keys, the sound of Jon behind her and grunting underneath Gendry&rsquo;s\nweight making her lose her concentration.<br /><br />\nAt last, she got the door unlocked and open. She\npushed Arya through and made room for Jon to do the same for Gendry.&nbsp;<br /><br />\nSansa would have very much liked to have closed\nthe door as soon as they were all inside, but she couldn&rsquo;t do something so rude\nafter he&rsquo;d come out in the cold to get them past three and the morning and had physically\nlugged Gendry out of the car. Sansa spent thirty minutes on the elliptical a\nfew times a week, but she was not strong enough to have handled both Arya and\nGendry in drunken stupors on her own.<br /><br />\nSo instead she lingered at the threshold, one\nfoot inside, one outside. &ldquo;Thank you for your help,&rdquo; she told him.&nbsp;<br /><br />\nJon shoved his hands into his pockets. A lock of\nhair had escaped his bun and had fallen into his eyes.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;It was no problem, Sansa. It&mdash;it was nice to see\nyou.&rdquo;<br /><br />\nHe studied her face with an expression she\ncouldn&rsquo;t understand, and after a moment, gave a curt nod and turned to go.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Jon!&rdquo; she took a step forward into the night\nair and called out to him without meaning to.<br /><br />\nHe spun around.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;I&mdash;I met a friend of yours at school. Samwell\nTarly.&rdquo; The words were out of her mouth before she could think to take them\nback.<br /><br />\nJon blinked. &ldquo;Samwell Tarly? How&mdash;he&mdash;but he&rsquo;s\nwith the Watch still.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;He got a few days leave.&rdquo;<br /><br />\nJon frowned, the lines of his forehead furrowed.\nHe hadn&rsquo;t had such deep lines there when they&rsquo;d been in high school. &ldquo;But\nwhy&rsquo;d&mdash;&ldquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dating Sam&rsquo;s brother Dickon,&rdquo; she said,\ntrying to sound unaffected as she delivered the news; to her own ears, she just\nsounded squeaky.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Jon replied. His face shifted from\nastonishment and confusion to something else. He opened his mouth, as if to ask\na question, but then closed it again.&nbsp;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;He&mdash;he said something about letters.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Sam loves old letters and books. Just like you.\nHe&rsquo;s always going on about a collection or something from medieval history&mdash;&ldquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;No&mdash;these were your letters. Letters that\nyou&mdash;well, you&rsquo;d written to me.&rdquo;<br /><br />\nJon frowned again, deeper this time. &ldquo;He\nshouldn&rsquo;t have said anything to you about that.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Is it true? Did you&mdash;&ldquo;<br /><br />\nJon cut her off with a look. &ldquo;You should go\ninside, Sansa,&rdquo; he said gruffly.&nbsp;<br /><br />\nShe crossed her arms over her chest, showing no\nindication of leaving until he gave her answer. </p><p>Jon sighed, and when he spoke, he sounded tired. &ldquo;When I\nfirst joined the Watch, I was feeling homesick. Reception is really bad that\nfar up north, so I used to write letters.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To me?&rdquo; Sansa pressed.</p><p>Jon&rsquo;s shoulders sagged. &ldquo;In a sense.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what that means,&rdquo; Sansa replied, voicing her thoughts\naloud. </p><p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; he sighed and gave her a look that made her heart\ndrop. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s late,&rdquo; Jon replied with more softness in his voice. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re\ndrunk.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;But, I&mdash;&ldquo;<br /><br />\nHe gave her a little smile. &ldquo;It really was nice\nto see you. Good night, Sansa.&rdquo;<br /><br />\nAnd then he turned, walked back to Robb&rsquo;s car,\nand drove into the night.</p>",
