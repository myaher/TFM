Sometimes it&rsquo;s easier to tell than others. A lot of movie and TV wigs are outstanding&ndash;think Game of Thrones. But the giveaways are when someone&rsquo;s hairline looks just a bit too full at the front, or the part is too severe and/or perfect, or again, looks just slightly too full, or their overall hair is just very dense. Most people have sparse or uneven hairlines that are hard to fake, even with an excellent lace-front wig. (And this goes, too, for people with naturally thick hair. The hairline is always the thinnest part, and the part of your hair will always look a little thinner along the edges, rather than going from a knife-straight part to boom, dense hair.)</p><p>Of course, the biggest giveaway is if the shape of the person&rsquo;s head at the back or top looks not quite right, although that&rsquo;s often hidden in post through the wonders of movie magic. But I\u2019ve worn many a wig in my day and can recognize one when I see it!</p><p>The two most common and effective methods of installing a wig or hairpiece are either to glue it down and use makeup to hide the lace, or set the wig slightly behind the natural hairline so the front is the person&rsquo;s actual hair. From there you line up the part of your hair with that of the wig, then use makeup or temporary colour to match the wig. The method all depends on what kind of hairstyle it is, or if it&rsquo;s a closeup shot, etc. Hair without a part automatically has to be glued down in front, for instance, because there\u2019s nothing you can blend it with to make it look natural, and no part to line up.</p><p>In TWS you can see they used both methods on Scarlett:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"799\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d939d927322bd3531974fa67502aa836/tumblr_inline_pibp5sdTnU1qhieqf_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"799\"/></figure><p>The wig is behind her natural hairline here. The front of her hair is slightly lighter in colour (because she\u2019s naturally blonde, and they coloured the front bits of her hair copper) and less dense, and you can see the line where the wig is darker and fuller. It also looks really full toward the back of the crown where most people\u2019s hair tends to naturally lie more flat unless they\u2019ve backcombed the shit out of it.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/10b267e628d65d8758f89fd479e07bea/tumblr_inline_pibp9m0SNl1qhieqf_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\"/></figure><p>In this picture you can see the slight line of the lace at the hairline, if you look closely. I\u2019m certain they glued the wig down here because her hair matches more uniformly in colour, and it looks more dense at the hairline than in the first picture.</p><p>For comparison, here\u2019s Scarlett\u2019s natural hairline:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"629\" data-orig-height=\"354\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f5bc4d4b05a30356322c50b46f537725/tumblr_inline_pibpf1lvVc1qhieqf_640.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"629\" data-orig-height=\"354\"/></figure><p>It\u2019s more uneven and has some sparse areas, not because she\u2019s losing hair, but because people just don\u2019t tend to have the hairline a wig creates. Especially people who use a lot of styling tools on their hair&ndash;mechanical damage can often thin the hair in front, or leave more baby hairs.</p><p>But the most telling giveaway is in the BTS shots, like this one.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"816\" data-orig-height=\"1222\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3bc3868ff06279b65a049f205f638367/tumblr_inline_pibpgj8tte1qhieqf_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"816\" data-orig-height=\"1222\"/></figure><p>The colour and shape of it just don\u2019t look natural at all, especially at the back. It\u2019s too full and kind of sticks out farther than the line of her skull because her natural hair is stuffed underneath, creating a bump. That is obviously a wig.</p><p>You can see it\u2019s a wig in Ultron as well. Almost identical hairstyle to what she had in Avengers 1, above, but the hairline is totally different&ndash;too perfect, too uniformly dense where it should be uneven and wispy in places. She was pregnant here, so it makes sense that she wouldn\u2019t be dyeing her hair.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"akamatthewmurdock:caqDt261Ph10shdY5_ZbMA:ZIMhHj2QgiFRl\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a47d2d45416a6722bedd151e47036e84/tumblr_oxckwpFCTp1ui45hlo1_r1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"209\"/></figure><p>For what it\u2019s worth, I think it\u2019s totally reasonable for Scarlett to have switched to wearing wigs for her MCU films. Red is a bitch to get out of blonde hair (I speak from experience), and I wouldn\u2019t want to deal with having to bleach it out four times after every film. That\u2019s hard on the hair.</p><p>And another thing: if you thought Chris Evans wasn\u2019t wearing a frontal (wig) in Infinity War&hellip; think again. Cap\u2019s mad flow was more unnatural than the CGI they did for Proxima Midnight. It suited him, but Chris Evans does NOT have that hairline. Girlfriend only wishes she did.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"590\" data-orig-height=\"350\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c9812e65b70b8368f6ff2214b40d470e/tumblr_inline_pibpww2o4O1qhieqf_640.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"590\" data-orig-height=\"350\"/></figure><p>Even when he\u2019s wearing a similar longer hairstyle, you can see his hairline comes to more of a gentle point and is slightly more sparse. Men\u2019s hair especially tends to do this more as they age, going thinner at the temples first and creating a more pronounced shape at the front of the hair.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"430\" data-orig-height=\"516\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/be70b3ffd82fdca24e2ef3e5cd45ef36/tumblr_inline_pibpzuRksR1qhieqf_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"430\" data-orig-height=\"516\"/></figure><p>The H&amp;MU team almost nailed it, but not quite (and they nailed it on some days more than others, because his hairline changes in the movie, going from natural looking at times, with that gentle peak, to too-straight and fake). It also shortens his forehead a little. Not that he\u2019s got a fivehead, but it\u2019s not that small, and his hair isn\u2019t as thick at the temples like in the photo below:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"630\" data-orig-height=\"400\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/58c56f1cbcf5899c5f0928661b9134d4/tumblr_inline_picfzxZBg01qhieqf_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"630\" data-orig-height=\"400\"/></figure><p>They gave him a fake beard for reshoots too, but that\u2019s another post entirely.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"600\" data-orig-width=\"834\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4734305c04420ec28ecd6ac4d794c84a/tumblr_inline_pii5e5iEEE1qhieqf_1280.png\" data-orig-height=\"600\" data-orig-width=\"834\"/></figure><p>They done you dirty there, Chris.</p><p>Anyway, hope that answered your question and gave you some insight! There are some really fantastic YouTube videos out there about applying lace-front wigs to make them look more natural. It\u2019s a fascinating process and some people are mind-blowingly good at it. I am not one of those people. The first time I met <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-FaOcj2-F8nTCaybdYpUKQ\" target=\"_blank\">@formerlyfebricant</a> I got loudly called out by a drag queen for wearing a wig (I was going through a tough hair transition period, okay), and it haunts me to this day. She literally called me Wig all night in front of a packed bar. And that&rsquo;s the story of how I know about what gives away a bad hairpiece.</p>",

But I\u2019ve worn many a wig in my day and can recognize one when I see it!</p><p>The two most common and effective methods of installing a wig or hairpiece are either to glue it down and use makeup to hide the lace, or set the wig slightly behind the natural hairline so the front is the person\u2019s actual hair. From there you line up the part of your hair with that of the wig, then use makeup or temporary colour to match the wig. The method all depends on what kind of hairstyle it is, or if it\u2019s a closeup shot, etc. Hair without a part automatically has to be glued down in front, for instance, because there\u2019s nothing you can blend it with to make it look natural, and no part to line up.</p><p>In TWS you can see they used both methods on Scarlett:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"799\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d939d927322bd3531974fa67502aa836/tumblr_inline_pibp5sdTnU1qhieqf_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"799\"></figure><p>The wig is behind her natural hairline here.

Cap&rsquo;s mad flow was more unnatural than the CGI they did for Proxima Midnight. It suited him, but Chris Evans does NOT have that hairline. Girlfriend only wishes she did.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c9812e65b70b8368f6ff2214b40d470e/tumblr_inline_pibpww2o4O1qhieqf_640.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Even when he&rsquo;s wearing a similar longer hairstyle, you can see his hairline comes to more of a gentle point and is slightly more sparse. Men&rsquo;s hair especially tends to do this more as they age, going thinner at the temples first and creating a more pronounced shape at the front of the hair.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/be70b3ffd82fdca24e2ef3e5cd45ef36/tumblr_inline_pibpzuRksR1qhieqf_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The H&amp;MU team almost nailed it, but not quite (and they nailed it on some days more than others, because his hairline changes in the movie, going from natural looking at times, with that gentle peak, to too-straight and fake). It also shortens his forehead a little. Not that he&rsquo;s got a fivehead, but it&rsquo;s not that small, and his hair isn&rsquo;t as thick at the temples like in the photo below:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/58c56f1cbcf5899c5f0928661b9134d4/tumblr_inline_picfzxZBg01qhieqf_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>They gave him a fake beard for reshoots too, but that&rsquo;s another post entirely.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4734305c04420ec28ecd6ac4d794c84a/tumblr_inline_pii5e5iEEE1qhieqf_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>They done you dirty there, Chris.</p><p>Anyway, hope that answered your question and gave you some insight! There are some really fantastic YouTube videos out there about applying lace-front wigs to make them look more natural. It&rsquo;s a fascinating process and some people are mind-blowingly good at it. I am not one of those people. The first time I met <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-FaOcj2-F8nTCaybdYpUKQ\" target=\"_blank\">@formerlyfebricant</a> I got loudly called out by a drag queen for wearing a wig (I was going through a tough hair transition period, okay), and it haunts me to this day. She literally called me Wig all night in front of a packed bar. And that&rsquo;s the story of how I know about what gives away a bad hairpiece.</p></p>",

Ever since your date, Josh has been doing something new with you everyday. You were mad a Bucky though. He refused to let you come along on missions, he even convinced the rest of the team somehow to agree on this. Even Peter! You were tired of this and spent most of your time with Josh instead.</p><p>Bucky ended up telling the team about the nightmares. Tony had the worst reaction, he isolated himself for two days, destroyed his room in the process. How could he not have seen this. He was your father, how could he have missed this. But Natasha helped him get through it telling him not to comfort you, knowing you would push them away if they did. Steve was in shock, he knew it happened ONCE, you told him it only happened once and they stopped. You told him. He should\u2019ve pushed up to tell him, he should\u2019ve done more. Clint and Bruce couldn\u2019t even process the information. Wanda cried, Vision held her. Sam was broken. Everyone knew, but no one could do anything.</p><p>Three weeks. Three weeks since you\u2019ve been on a mission but also three weeks you and Josh have been dating . And it was amazing. He held your hand in the hallways, kissed you by the lockers, walked you to every class, took you to lunch after school, if you weren\u2019t busy, and he would make you feel so special.</p><p>That was until he started becoming a little distant, it was Wednesday, and he barely talked to you after you guys hung out Sunday. He said he was busy. You were fine. Everything was fine. You know not to get attached to things, especially people. You hadn\u2019t fully trusted Josh and he hasn\u2019t fully trusted you so it\u2019s fine to have too spend some days just for yourself. That was until Wednesday in the cafeteria. You were talking to Mj and Ned who were sitting on either side of you, Flash and Peter were talking about the Spanish quiz tomorrow, they were sitting in front of you.</p><p>\u201cYou guys wanna do a Star Wars marathon this Friday?\u201d Ned asked with a huge smile.</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019m free.\u201d MJ says, then looking at you , so you could respond.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m free too.\u201d You say, you loved spending time with your friends. \u00a0You turn to Peter and Flash. \u201cYou guys in?\u201d They weren\u2019t looking at you, and they weren\u2019t talking, they were actually staring in shock at what was behind you. Ned turns behind to see what was happening and quickly looks between Peter and Flash. They both shake there heads \u2018no\u2019. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d You say turning to see what they were looking at. But before you could see anything, Peter jumps over the table standing in front of you, so you could only see his chest. \u201cWhat\u2019s up Peter, move.\u201d You were annoyed and confused at why he suddenly moved to block your path. You stand up, trying to get Peter to move. It was getting annoying. \u201cPeter, what the fuck, just move.\u201d Flash comes by Peter holding your shoulders.</p><p>\u201cY/N, it-its not a big deal.\u201d Flash says, sadness covered his face and so did Peter\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s not a big deal then why can\u2019t I see.\u201d Peter and Flash both stood side by side blocking your view. That\u2019s it, you pushed both of them to the side, using a little force from your powers, (the energy in your powers could make you stronger when you wanted too). But you instantly regretted it. There he was. Josh, his hands around another girls shoulder, they were making out, for a long time. The whole entire cafeteria fell silent, when they saw Y/N Stark standing in shock with her two friends not knowing what to do. The silence caught Josh\u2019s attention, he made eye contact with you. You didn\u2019t know what you were feeling. You could feel the heat rising in your hands. Peter saw you tense, and he looked down at your hands, they were starting to light up. He quickly moved past Flash, taking your hands in his. You didn\u2019t move. Your eyes were still locked on Josh\u2019s. Josh was frozen. He knew he fucked up big time. He got out of his table and started walking towards you.</p><p>\u201cY/N, its-its not what it looks like, let me explain-\u201d He was about to reach for your shoulder, but Peter was quick to turn around and punch him. knocking him to the floor as he grabbed his eye. Peter was going to go for another punch until he felt Flash holding him back.</p><p>\u201cNot here man- not here.\u201d Flash whispers to Peter, pushing him back to you. You still hadn\u2019t moved. You were still trying to figure out what your were feeling. Peter on the other hand knew exactly what he felt, anger. He knew this would happen, he knew Josh wouldn\u2019t treat you like you wanted him too. He could feel his blood boiling. When he saw Josh standing up and making his way to him, Peter was just about ready to kill the guy until Flash stepped in. He pushed Josh back. \u201cGet the fuck away from here, before you start something you regret dumbass.\u201d Flash pushes Josh back. Peter was standing in front of you, Flash was defending you, Mj was holding your hand and Ned was rubbing your back, the cafeteria was staring, some people were even filming it. It was too much. That\u2019s one thing you knew. You can\u2019t be here. You can\u2019t be here.</p><p>You push past everyone heading for the door leaving your bag and phone and everything, your only focus was on getting out of there. You ran down the hall, pushing the schools front doors open as Peter chased you down the hall, calling your name. But you ignored it, the sound muffled as a million things raced through your head. You unchained your bike and quickly rode out of the school onto the busy streets of NYC, leaving Peter standing in front of the school, pulling at his hair.</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>You didn\u2019t stop, you kept riding, you went straight, right, left, anywhere, anywhere that wasn\u2019t there. You finally get to the edge of New York City. You were by the ocean, you don\u2019t know which park this was, and you didn\u2019t care. At least no one was here. You dropped your bike by the sand and sat down by the ocean . And you looked out.</p><p>The waves crashing down, as the wind breezed through your hair. The sun beating on your face. You lay your head back on the sand, as you closed your eyes soaking up the sun and its heat. You weren\u2019t crying, you weren\u2019t yelling, you weren\u2019t feeling. Your closed. Your done.</p><p>You watched the sun set, admiring the beautiful colors in the sky. You forgot about time and day. You just watched the sun. That\u2019s it. Nothing else was in your head, Just the sun. The sun now over the arisen, stars started to pop up in the sky and you focused on that then. You looked for the constellations that you remembered as a kid. Your dad use to take you to the roof of the Stark Tower, when it was the Stark Tower, and he would lay a blanket and you guys would just lay there finding constellations. It\u2019s been years since you sat quietly and looked for constellations. You then fell asleep looking up at the night sky.</p><p><i>\u201cFuck. You.\u201d you say. Staring the man dead in the eye. He goes for another punch, this time to the face. You take the hit and spit the blood out on the side. You were tied down to a chair, your wrists and legs bound to the chair, with the \u2018handcuffs\u2019. You couldn\u2019t break from them no matter how much energy you tried to release, it wouldn\u2019t d even let your fingertips heat up.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThis will keep going, the more you resist, the more you disobey, the more pain we\u2019ll cause. Simple as that.\u201d The man says, going over to the table behind him grabbing another tool. Hey presses it against your naked stomach, only wearing a bra and panties. You bit your lip in pain, not wanting him to feel the satisfaction in your cries, you smell the burning flesh and you can feel your skin bubbling. He retracks the tool, you breathe out, taking in deep breathes.</i></p><p><i>This wasn\u2019t new for you, you acted out, you shouldn\u2019t have, but you did. They killed your cell neighbor the only person you could take too at night. You guys spent the nights talking about your old lives. Even though there was a wall between you guys, you still cared about him. He was like an older brother to you, he usually stopped the guard&rsquo;s from touching you. He got most of them away, but not all of them. At night a few guard\u2019s would come into your cell and touch you, and sexually assault you. You would cry out in pain as Wade screamed from his cell for them to stop. His name was Wade Wilson, he made your days there better, with his funny as hell jokes and random commentary. The day they took him down to the basement and never returned him you knew what they did. \u00a0 \u00a0</i></p><p><i>The man placed the tool down and picked up the needle. Your eyes wide and you started to shake your head violently. They gave you those needles often, and they were the worst pain ever. \u201cNo, no please. Please, one more chance please just don\u2019t-\u201d before you could finish your sentence, the needle made contact with your skin, the blue liquid entering your bloodstream. The pain coursed through your body and your scream erupted. </i></p><p>Your body shots up, your hand coming to your chest feeling your heart beating at lighting speed. You look up to see the sun rising, you start taking deep breathes, focusing on the sun, trying to relax your mind. You rub your eyes, as you look around. There were a few people passing by staring at you, some taking pictures of Y/N Stark sleeping on the sand. You ignore it though, your eyes moving back to the sun. </p><p>You wait until the sun has fully risen, until you start to push yourself onto your feet. You pat some of the sand off you, as you pick your bike up, swinging your leg over the seat and start peddling. You pass by the cars, and yelling people making there way to work. </p><p>The Avenger\u2019s compound then comes into view and you keep pedaling until you rest your bike against the wall and walk in. You kick your shoes off, you make your way to the comman area to get to your room. You find everyone suited up yelling at each other. You ignore it, you see your bag on the floor and go over to pick it up and you start to make your way to your room. No one seemed to notice you until </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s back.\u201d Peter says, sighing in relief. Everyone turns around to see you walking away. Tony pushes through everyone and calls your name out. </p><p>\u201cY/N, Y/N!\u201d but you continue to walk, not wanting to deal with this right now. \u201cY/N where were you! We were going to send out everyone to look for you! Hey!\u201d Your eyes are focused on the hallway. You finally make it to your room and slam it shut, tapping the screen next to the door so the door locks. You hear your dads footsteps finally making it to your room. He goes to turn the knob to find it locked. \u201cY/N-Y/N! Open the door!\u201d You drop your bag on the floor and look to your clock on 12:45pm. You make your way to the bathroom washing your face. You still hear the banging on your door and your dad calling your name from behind it.</p><p>Steve makes his way down the hall to see an angry Tony banging on your door, yelling your name. He comes over and places a hand on his shoulder. \u201cLeave her. She\u2019ll come out-\u201d Tony cuts Steve off.</p><p>\u201cNo, she fucking disappeared from the school, she didn\u2019t even come home. Where the fuck was she! For all I knew she could\u2019ve been taken! S-she could\u2019ve been l-lying dead somewhere.\u201d Tony couldn\u2019t even get the words out before a sob left his mouth. Steve looked at Tony, his heart shattering to a million pieces to see his friend in this state. The only person that could make him like this was you. He thought you were dead. Steve dragged Tony to his office, not wanting the rest of the team to see Tony like this. Tony went to his scotch pouring himself a drink and taking a swing. Steve let it happen, he knew Tony went through a lot today. </p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>You went to your closet about two hours later, pulling on a pair of sports shorts, and sports bra and throwing a tank-top over it. You put your Nikes on and grab your gym bag as you leave your room. The compound was silent, but you didn\u2019t care. Your face expressionless, your heart feeling cold as ice. You couldn\u2019t feel anything. You made your way to the training room. </p><p>The training room was practically a gym, there was a huge mat placed at the center, where you guys often spared each other in. There were weights around the edge, and boxing bags lined in a row, there were other equipment as well. You go to the bleachers dropping your bag down and opening the bag. You take out your boxing tap and you start wrapping them around your hands. </p><p>\u201cFRIDAY play my workout playlist.\u201d You yell. FRIDAY plays the music, it echos through the gym walls. You tell FRIDAY to higher the volume, so that\u2019s the only thing you could hear. You move to the boxing bag, and you start punching. Your punches becoming stronger with each throw, all the anger you kept in starting to leak out. And you let it. </p><p>Your hands starting to heat up and they started to glow, with one last punch you send the bag flying across the room. You move to grab another bag, hanging it up and continuing. You don\u2019t know how long you\u2019ve been in the training room, until you hear someone speak from behind you.</p><p>\u201cWanna talk about it.\u201d <i>Steve. </i>You continue punching the bag. </p><p>\u201cNo- theres - nothing - too - talk - about!\u201d The bag flies across the room. You go over and hang up another bag. Steve looks around the room noticing about twenty bags laying around the room. Steve knew you don\u2019t like talking about shit like that so he did what he knew you\u2019d agree on doing.</p><p>\u201cOk&hellip; how about we take break from boxing, and spare?\u201d Your punches hesitated, knowing what he was trying to do. You continue punching the bag. \u201cC\u2019mon Y/N, me and you. You haven\u2019t been on the field for awhile. Let\u2019s see what you\u2019ve got.\u201d You stopped your punches holding the bag so it wouldn\u2019t swing back and hit you. You turn around, Steve notices the anger in your eyes. He could see your hands balled in fists. He\u2019s never seen you like this. And it scared him a little. </p><p>\u201cAnd who\u2019s fault is that, Huh?! Oh yea it was everyone\u2019s ! All of you said I couldn\u2019t go on missions anymore!\u201d You unwrap the tape around your hands and throw them behind you, making your way to the mat, in the middle of the room. You stand in the middle putting your hands up in guard. \u201cYou wanna see what I\u2019ve got, c\u2019mon. I\u2019m ready!\u201d Steve hesitated a bit, this wasn\u2019t such a good idea. When sparing, it\u2019s usually hand to hand combat meaning no powers. Rules were don\u2019t kill each other and if the other person says stop it\u2019s over. Other than that, everything else is fine. </p><p>\u201cRemember the rules?\u201d Steve says making his way to you. He just wanted to make sure you weren\u2019t going to kill him.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know the fucking rules!\u201d You spat, annoyed with absolutely everything at this point. Steve brushed off your attitude and nodded his head. Steve stands in front of you putting his hands up in guard. </p><p>\u201cOk, lets go.\u201d You were quick to through the first punch, which was not like you, you get Steve right in jaw. Steve hesitates a bit, taken aback by the sudden anger filling you. You and Steve go back an forth, Steve was mostly on defensive not wanting to hurt you when your in this state. People started coming into the room taking a seat on the bleachers. You caught a few people from the corner of your eye, Peter, Clint and Nat were sitting in the first row, Sam and Rhodey behind them, Wanda came in shortly after and not surprising Vision comes in behind her. You then notice Bucky enter , but ignore him, still annoyed about what he did. But you didn\u2019t focus on them, it was only on Steve. The more punches and kicks you threw the more you grew angry. Your blood was boiling. When Steve makes you loose your balance, falling on your back, you let out a grunt. Steve jogs up to you ready to pick you up.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d you say pushing his hands away and standing up quickly going back to guard. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Steve looks at your fists, your nails digging into your palms. He shakes his head \u2018no\u2019. \u201cWhat?!\u201d You say frustrated. It was his damn idea. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done Y/N. Lets take a break-\u201d You turn away from Steve and face the bleachers. </p><p>You raise your hands up, \u201cAnyone care to spare!\u201d You yell eyeing everyone. They all exchange looks, they could see your distressed figure, but if this was the only way you wanted to communicate then so be it. Sam was the first to stand up. He makes his way to you rolling up his sleeves. \u201cOk&hellip;Lets go\u201d Steve nods at Sam, and you guys start fighting. You and Sam go back and forth for about thirty minutes, it was long. Until Sam notices how this wasn\u2019t any good and you catch him off guard knocking him off his feet, his back hitting the floor. \u201cC\u2019mon, get up.\u201d Sam rolls over standing back up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done Y/N\u201d you roll your eyes and turn back to the bleachers. </p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s next!\u201d Clint stands up making his way to you. Clint often trained you, most of your fight combinations you learned were from him. You nod your head, Steve calls it and you guys start fighting. Every hit fueled your anger, every punch you threw was building up your anger and frustration. You just wanted to let go, but you couldn\u2019t. You pushed through it, and kept fighting. Clint knocked you and you stubbled back, but not completely falling. Clint calls it though. Wanda takes his place. She then drops and Vision comes in. After Vision. Bucky then offers to fight.\u00a0\u201cNo.\u201d Everyone looks at you, you said you wanted to fight. You did but not Bucky. Bucky silently sat back down.</p><p>By the time you got to Nat, you wouldn\u2019t even look anyone in the eye, your head feeling like it was going to explode. Your hands were up ready to start fighting Nat, but Steve quickly grabs your hands. You look up at him your eyebrows furrowed.\u00a0\u201cWhat?!\u201d You say struggling to get out of his grip.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo. Powers.\u201d He said, you look down at your hands, they were about to let an energy ball out. You nodd your head.</p><p>\u201cYea I know. Sorry. I\u2019m fine. Let. go.\u201d You say not loosing your stern voice. Steve lets go backing up. He yells start, Nat throws the first kick, and you guys fight. You always hated fighting Nat and Steve, they were always the hardest, and they fueled you up. they knocked you down and got you questioning every move, making you more and more angry. Nat knocks you to the floor for the sixth time, finally making it the last.\u00a0\u201cWhat?!\u201d you say standing up wiping the faint blood trickling down your forehead.</p><p>\u201cYour bleeding Y/N. I\u2019m not gonna fight you. You need a break.\u201d Nat says making her way to you, but you back up not letting her touch you.\u00a0</p><p>You scoff,\u00a0\u201c I don\u2019t need shit. If you don\u2019t wanna fight get off the mat!\u201d You spat turning your back and looking at the bleachers for what seemed like the thousandth time.\u00a0\u201cSo! Who\u2019s next!\u201d you yelled annoyed that they haven\u2019t gotten the message that someone has to be on the mat with her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d you look down seeing Peter making his way towards you. You square up on the mat.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOk\u201d, You don\u2019t dare look Peter in the eye, avoiding his gaze at all costs.\u00a0Steve calls it and you start. You throw a punch and kick missing both times, this went on for awhile, Peter didn\u2019t get hit once and he didn\u2019t dare hit you, not wanting to cause you any kind of pain. All he did was dodge and you were the one trying to get him. It was getting you more worked up.\u00a0\u201cStop dodging! Fucking hit me Peter!\u201d You yell, Peter ignores your request and continues dodging each punch and kick. Until you lost it. You didn\u2019t know what came over you, it was like your breaking point and you couldn\u2019t control it. The huge energy ball came out of nowhere hurdling towards Peter. Steve was quick to grab Nat and pull her down, everyone else dropped to the floor taking shelter. You looked up seeing a huge hole in the wall.\u00a0\u201coh my god.\u201d You ran towards the wall, looking through it, you got out walking outside to see pieces of the wall scattered around the field. You looked around for Peter.\u00a0\u201cPETER!\u201d Your breathing quickened, you gasped for air.\u00a0\u201cPETER!\u201d Before you knew it there was a tap on your shoulder and you wipe your head around and see Peters face. He sensed the energy ball coming towards him and he quickly latched on the ceiling dodging the energy. You threw yourself at Peter.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Peter I\u2019m so so sorry, oh my god-\u201d Peter wrapped on arm around your waist and the other stroked your hair as you held him with your life.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine Y/N, I\u2019m fine.\u201d You pulled away, you felt the tears prickling your eyes. <i>NO YOU CAN\u2019T LET GO YOU CAN\u2019T!</i>\u00a0You looked at Peter, he noticed your glassy eyes. He brought one hand up to your cheek.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m okay Y/N\u201d he said softly, with a reassuring smile. And thats when you lost it, your body fell numb as your body collapsed, Peter wrapped his hand around your waist and fell to the ground with you. He hugged you on the ground as you let go. Your tears soaked up his shirt.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t, I-It hurts Peter. It hurts so bad.\u201d You sobbed, as all the feelings you kept locked up for the past five years came out. The tears ran down your face like a waterfall, it wouldn\u2019t stop. And you felt a weight being lifted off your shoulder. Peter stroked your back and just brought you closer to his body. \u201cP-peter, Im so sorry. I-I can\u2019t\u201d You soaked up in his shirt, grabbing everything he was giving you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI-It\u2019s okay Y/N,\u201d He kissed the side of your head.\u00a0You couldn\u2019t breathe, you pulled back trying to gasp for hair. Peters hand flys up to your face, stroking your cheek bones. He looks You in the eye and says \u201cLet it go,\u201d and thats exactly what you did. You yelled out in pain as Peter held you close. The rest of the team watched from afar, they held each other watching you cry on Peters shoulder. All there hearts breaking at the amount of pain you\u2019ve kept in, a 16 year old girl, there 16 year old girl should not be holding that much pain and that\u2019s when they finally realized everything you\u2019ve went through. Nat and Wanda were silently crying as the guys choked back there tears. Peter soon started to feel the tears running down his cheeks. He continued to hold you as you felt the world beating you down.\u00a0</p><p>After what seemed like a hours, everyone had gone inside awhile ago giving you space. You were just breathing heavy, having felt like you had no more tears to let out. Your eyes were red and puffy. Your head rested on Peters shoulder, your body in a tight ball on Peters lap. You soon fell asleep on his shoulder. It was already night time, so Peter picks you up and makes his way to your room. He passes by the team, Steve was talking to Tony, when Tony\u2019s eye caught your torn down body in Peter\u2019s arms. Peter could tell Tony had been crying&hellip; and drinking for awhile. The team noticed your sleeping figure and didn\u2019t dare make a sound. Except for Tony, he made his way to Peter, he halted his stance, no letting go of you, afraid to wake you up. Tony stood in front of Peter, looking down at his daughter. He pushed a few strands of hair from your face, placing a kiss on your forehead, before stepping out of the way, nodding to Peter.\u00a0</p><p>Peter carefully placed you on your bed, he tucked you under the blankets. Before he could walk away from the bed you grabbed his wrist. He looks down at you,\u00a0\u201cStay.\u201d you say weakly. Peter gives you a soft smile nodding his head. You slide over, making room for Peter. Peter pulls the blanket above both your bodies. You slide closer to him resting you head on his chest, taking in his scent. Peter wrapped his arm around your waist pulling you closer. You let out a sigh and fall into a deep sleep. Peter rubs small circles on your waist until he too falls asleep.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>A/N: I hope you guys liked Part 8, </p><p>Part 9 coming soon! </p>",

Ever since your date, Josh has been doing something new with you everyday. You were mad a Bucky though. He refused to let you come along on missions, he even convinced the rest of the team somehow to agree on this. Even Peter! You were tired of this and spent most of your time with Josh instead.</p><p>Bucky ended up telling the team about the nightmares. Tony had the worst reaction, he isolated himself for two days, destroyed his room in the process. How could he not have seen this. He was your father, how could he have missed this. But Natasha helped him get through it telling him not to comfort you, knowing you would push them away if they did. Steve was in shock, he knew it happened ONCE, you told him it only happened once and they stopped. You told him. He should\u2019ve pushed up to tell him, he should\u2019ve done more. Clint and Bruce couldn\u2019t even process the information. Wanda cried, Vision held her. Sam was broken. Everyone knew, but no one could do anything.</p><p>Three weeks. Three weeks since you\u2019ve been on a mission but also three weeks you and Josh have been dating . And it was amazing. He held your hand in the hallways, kissed you by the lockers, walked you to every class, took you to lunch after school, if you weren\u2019t busy, and he would make you feel so special.</p><p>That was until he started becoming a little distant, it was Wednesday, and he barely talked to you after you guys hung out Sunday. He said he was busy. You were fine. Everything was fine. You know not to get attached to things, especially people. You hadn\u2019t fully trusted Josh and he hasn\u2019t fully trusted you so it\u2019s fine to have too spend some days just for yourself. That was until Wednesday in the cafeteria. You were talking to Mj and Ned who were sitting on either side of you, Flash and Peter were talking about the Spanish quiz tomorrow, they were sitting in front of you.</p><p>\u201cYou guys wanna do a Star Wars marathon this Friday?\u201d Ned asked with a huge smile.</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019m free.\u201d MJ says, then looking at you , so you could respond.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m free too.\u201d You say, you loved spending time with your friends. \u00a0You turn to Peter and Flash. \u201cYou guys in?\u201d They weren\u2019t looking at you, and they weren\u2019t talking, they were actually staring in shock at what was behind you. Ned turns behind to see what was happening and quickly looks between Peter and Flash. They both shake there heads \u2018no\u2019. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d You say turning to see what they were looking at. But before you could see anything, Peter jumps over the table standing in front of you, so you could only see his chest. \u201cWhat\u2019s up Peter, move.\u201d You were annoyed and confused at why he suddenly moved to block your path. You stand up, trying to get Peter to move. It was getting annoying. \u201cPeter, what the fuck, just move.\u201d Flash comes by Peter holding your shoulders.</p><p>\u201cY/N, it-its not a big deal.\u201d Flash says, sadness covered his face and so did Peter\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s not a big deal then why can\u2019t I see.\u201d Peter and Flash both stood side by side blocking your view. That\u2019s it, you pushed both of them to the side, using a little force from your powers, (the energy in your powers could make you stronger when you wanted too). But you instantly regretted it. There he was. Josh, his hands around another girls shoulder, they were making out, for a long time. The whole entire cafeteria fell silent, when they saw Y/N Stark standing in shock with her two friends not knowing what to do. The silence caught Josh\u2019s attention, he made eye contact with you. You didn\u2019t know what you were feeling. You could feel the heat rising in your hands. Peter saw you tense, and he looked down at your hands, they were starting to light up. He quickly moved past Flash, taking your hands in his. You didn\u2019t move. Your eyes were still locked on Josh\u2019s. Josh was frozen. He knew he fucked up big time. He got out of his table and started walking towards you.</p><p>\u201cY/N, its-its not what it looks like, let me explain-\u201d He was about to reach for your shoulder, but Peter was quick to turn around and punch him. knocking him to the floor as he grabbed his eye. Peter was going to go for another punch until he felt Flash holding him back.</p><p>\u201cNot here man- not here.\u201d Flash whispers to Peter, pushing him back to you. You still hadn\u2019t moved. You were still trying to figure out what your were feeling. Peter on the other hand knew exactly what he felt, anger. He knew this would happen, he knew Josh wouldn\u2019t treat you like you wanted him too. He could feel his blood boiling. When he saw Josh standing up and making his way to him, Peter was just about ready to kill the guy until Flash stepped in. He pushed Josh back. \u201cGet the fuck away from here, before you start something you regret dumbass.\u201d Flash pushes Josh back. Peter was standing in front of you, Flash was defending you, Mj was holding your hand and Ned was rubbing your back, the cafeteria was staring, some people were even filming it. It was too much. That\u2019s one thing you knew. You can\u2019t be here. You can\u2019t be here.</p><p>You push past everyone heading for the door leaving your bag and phone and everything, your only focus was on getting out of there. You ran down the hall, pushing the schools front doors open as Peter chased you down the hall, calling your name. But you ignored it, the sound muffled as a million things raced through your head. You unchained your bike and quickly rode out of the school onto the busy streets of NYC, leaving Peter standing in front of the school, pulling at his hair.</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>You didn\u2019t stop, you kept riding, you went straight, right, left, anywhere, anywhere that wasn\u2019t there. You finally get to the edge of New York City. You were by the ocean, you don\u2019t know which park this was, and you didn\u2019t care. At least no one was here. You dropped your bike by the sand and sat down by the ocean . And you looked out.</p><p>The waves crashing down, as the wind breezed through your hair. The sun beating on your face. You lay your head back on the sand, as you closed your eyes soaking up the sun and its heat. You weren\u2019t crying, you weren\u2019t yelling, you weren\u2019t feeling. Your closed. Your done.</p><p>You watched the sun set, admiring the beautiful colors in the sky. You forgot about time and day. You just watched the sun. That\u2019s it. Nothing else was in your head, Just the sun. The sun now over the arisen, stars started to pop up in the sky and you focused on that then. You looked for the constellations that you remembered as a kid. Your dad use to take you to the roof of the Stark Tower, when it was the Stark Tower, and he would lay a blanket and you guys would just lay there finding constellations. It\u2019s been years since you sat quietly and looked for constellations. You then fell asleep looking up at the night sky.</p><p><i>\u201cFuck. You.\u201d you say. Staring the man dead in the eye. He goes for another punch, this time to the face. You take the hit and spit the blood out on the side. You were tied down to a chair, your wrists and legs bound to the chair, with the \u2018handcuffs\u2019. You couldn\u2019t break from them no matter how much energy you tried to release, it wouldn\u2019t d even let your fingertips heat up.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThis will keep going, the more you resist, the more you disobey, the more pain we\u2019ll cause. Simple as that.\u201d The man says, going over to the table behind him grabbing another tool. Hey presses it against your naked stomach, only wearing a bra and panties. You bit your lip in pain, not wanting him to feel the satisfaction in your cries, you smell the burning flesh and you can feel your skin bubbling. He retracks the tool, you breathe out, taking in deep breathes.</i></p><p><i>This wasn\u2019t new for you, you acted out, you shouldn\u2019t have, but you did. They killed your cell neighbor the only person you could take too at night. You guys spent the nights talking about your old lives. Even though there was a wall between you guys, you still cared about him. He was like an older brother to you, he usually stopped the guard\u2019s from touching you. He got most of them away, but not all of them. At night a few guard\u2019s would come into your cell and touch you, and sexually assault you. You would cry out in pain as Wade screamed from his cell for them to stop. His name was Wade Wilson, he made your days there better, with his funny as hell jokes and random commentary. The day they took him down to the basement and never returned him you knew what they did. \u00a0 \u00a0</i></p><p><i>The man placed the tool down and picked up the needle. Your eyes wide and you started to shake your head violently. They gave you those needles often, and they were the worst pain ever. \u201cNo, no please. Please, one more chance please just don\u2019t-\u201d before you could finish your sentence, the needle made contact with your skin, the blue liquid entering your bloodstream. The pain coursed through your body and your scream erupted. </i></p><p>Your body shots up, your hand coming to your chest feeling your heart beating at lighting speed. You look up to see the sun rising, you start taking deep breathes, focusing on the sun, trying to relax your mind. You rub your eyes, as you look around. There were a few people passing by staring at you, some taking pictures of Y/N Stark sleeping on the sand. You ignore it though, your eyes moving back to the sun. </p><p>You wait until the sun has fully risen, until you start to push yourself onto your feet. You pat some of the sand off you, as you pick your bike up, swinging your leg over the seat and start peddling. You pass by the cars, and yelling people making there way to work. </p><p>The Avenger\u2019s compound then comes into view and you keep pedaling until you rest your bike against the wall and walk in. You kick your shoes off, you make your way to the comman area to get to your room. You find everyone suited up yelling at each other. You ignore it, you see your bag on the floor and go over to pick it up and you start to make your way to your room. No one seemed to notice you until </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s back.\u201d Peter says, sighing in relief. Everyone turns around to see you walking away. Tony pushes through everyone and calls your name out. </p><p>\u201cY/N, Y/N!\u201d but you continue to walk, not wanting to deal with this right now. \u201cY/N where were you! We were going to send out everyone to look for you! Hey!\u201d Your eyes are focused on the hallway. You finally make it to your room and slam it shut, tapping the screen next to the door so the door locks. You hear your dads footsteps finally making it to your room. He goes to turn the knob to find it locked. \u201cY/N-Y/N! Open the door!\u201d You drop your bag on the floor and look to your clock on 12:45pm. You make your way to the bathroom washing your face. You still hear the banging on your door and your dad calling your name from behind it.</p><p>Steve makes his way down the hall to see an angry Tony banging on your door, yelling your name. He comes over and places a hand on his shoulder. \u201cLeave her. She\u2019ll come out-\u201d Tony cuts Steve off.</p><p>\u201cNo, she fucking disappeared from the school, she didn\u2019t even come home. Where the fuck was she! For all I knew she could\u2019ve been taken! S-she could\u2019ve been l-lying dead somewhere.\u201d Tony couldn\u2019t even get the words out before a sob left his mouth. Steve looked at Tony, his heart shattering to a million pieces to see his friend in this state. The only person that could make him like this was you. He thought you were dead. Steve dragged Tony to his office, not wanting the rest of the team to see Tony like this. Tony went to his scotch pouring himself a drink and taking a swing. Steve let it happen, he knew Tony went through a lot today. </p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>You went to your closet about two hours later, pulling on a pair of sports shorts, and sports bra and throwing a tank-top over it. You put your Nikes on and grab your gym bag as you leave your room. The compound was silent, but you didn\u2019t care. Your face expressionless, your heart feeling cold as ice. You couldn\u2019t feel anything. You made your way to the training room. </p><p>The training room was practically a gym, there was a huge mat placed at the center, where you guys often spared each other in. There were weights around the edge, and boxing bags lined in a row, there were other equipment as well. You go to the bleachers dropping your bag down and opening the bag. You take out your boxing tap and you start wrapping them around your hands. </p><p>\u201cFRIDAY play my workout playlist.\u201d You yell. FRIDAY plays the music, it echos through the gym walls. You tell FRIDAY to higher the volume, so that\u2019s the only thing you could hear. You move to the boxing bag, and you start punching. Your punches becoming stronger with each throw, all the anger you kept in starting to leak out. And you let it. </p><p>Your hands starting to heat up and they started to glow, with one last punch you send the bag flying across the room. You move to grab another bag, hanging it up and continuing. You don\u2019t know how long you\u2019ve been in the training room, until you hear someone speak from behind you.</p><p>\u201cWanna talk about it.\u201d <i>Steve. </i>You continue punching the bag. </p><p>\u201cNo- theres - nothing - too - talk - about!\u201d The bag flies across the room. You go over and hang up another bag. Steve looks around the room noticing about twenty bags laying around the room. Steve knew you don\u2019t like talking about shit like that so he did what he knew you\u2019d agree on doing.</p><p>\u201cOk\u2026 how about we take break from boxing, and spare?\u201d Your punches hesitated, knowing what he was trying to do. You continue punching the bag. \u201cC\u2019mon Y/N, me and you. You haven\u2019t been on the field for awhile. Let\u2019s see what you\u2019ve got.\u201d You stopped your punches holding the bag so it wouldn\u2019t swing back and hit you. You turn around, Steve notices the anger in your eyes. He could see your hands balled in fists. He\u2019s never seen you like this. And it scared him a little. </p><p>\u201cAnd who\u2019s fault is that, Huh?! Oh yea it was everyone\u2019s ! All of you said I couldn\u2019t go on missions anymore!\u201d You unwrap the tape around your hands and throw them behind you, making your way to the mat, in the middle of the room. You stand in the middle putting your hands up in guard. \u201cYou wanna see what I\u2019ve got, c\u2019mon. I\u2019m ready!\u201d Steve hesitated a bit, this wasn\u2019t such a good idea. When sparing, it\u2019s usually hand to hand combat meaning no powers. Rules were don\u2019t kill each other and if the other person says stop it\u2019s over. Other than that, everything else is fine. </p><p>\u201cRemember the rules?\u201d Steve says making his way to you. He just wanted to make sure you weren\u2019t going to kill him.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know the fucking rules!\u201d You spat, annoyed with absolutely everything at this point. Steve brushed off your attitude and nodded his head. Steve stands in front of you putting his hands up in guard. </p><p>\u201cOk, lets go.\u201d You were quick to through the first punch, which was not like you, you get Steve right in jaw. Steve hesitates a bit, taken aback by the sudden anger filling you. You and Steve go back an forth, Steve was mostly on defensive not wanting to hurt you when your in this state. People started coming into the room taking a seat on the bleachers. You caught a few people from the corner of your eye, Peter, Clint and Nat were sitting in the first row, Sam and Rhodey behind them, Wanda came in shortly after and not surprising Vision comes in behind her. You then notice Bucky enter , but ignore him, still annoyed about what he did. But you didn\u2019t focus on them, it was only on Steve. The more punches and kicks you threw the more you grew angry. Your blood was boiling. When Steve makes you loose your balance, falling on your back, you let out a grunt. Steve jogs up to you ready to pick you up.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d you say pushing his hands away and standing up quickly going back to guard. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Steve looks at your fists, your nails digging into your palms. He shakes his head \u2018no\u2019. \u201cWhat?!\u201d You say frustrated. It was his damn idea. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done Y/N. Lets take a break-\u201d You turn away from Steve and face the bleachers. </p><p>You raise your hands up, \u201cAnyone care to spare!\u201d You yell eyeing everyone. They all exchange looks, they could see your distressed figure, but if this was the only way you wanted to communicate then so be it. Sam was the first to stand up. He makes his way to you rolling up his sleeves. \u201cOk\u2026Lets go\u201d Steve nods at Sam, and you guys start fighting. You and Sam go back and forth for about thirty minutes, it was long. Until Sam notices how this wasn\u2019t any good and you catch him off guard knocking him off his feet, his back hitting the floor. \u201cC\u2019mon, get up.\u201d Sam rolls over standing back up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done Y/N\u201d you roll your eyes and turn back to the bleachers. </p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s next!\u201d Clint stands up making his way to you. Clint often trained you, most of your fight combinations you learned were from him. You nod your head, Steve calls it and you guys start fighting. Every hit fueled your anger, every punch you threw was building up your anger and frustration. You just wanted to let go, but you couldn\u2019t. You pushed through it, and kept fighting. Clint knocked you and you stubbled back, but not completely falling. Clint calls it though. Wanda takes his place. She then drops and Vision comes in. After Vision. Bucky then offers to fight.\u00a0\u201cNo.\u201d Everyone looks at you, you said you wanted to fight. You did but not Bucky. Bucky silently sat back down.</p><p>By the time you got to Nat, you wouldn\u2019t even look anyone in the eye, your head feeling like it was going to explode. Your hands were up ready to start fighting Nat, but Steve quickly grabs your hands. You look up at him your eyebrows furrowed.\u00a0\u201cWhat?!\u201d You say struggling to get out of his grip.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo. Powers.\u201d He said, you look down at your hands, they were about to let an energy ball out. You nodd your head.</p><p>\u201cYea I know. Sorry. I\u2019m fine. Let. go.\u201d You say not loosing your stern voice. Steve lets go backing up. He yells start, Nat throws the first kick, and you guys fight. You always hated fighting Nat and Steve, they were always the hardest, and they fueled you up. they knocked you down and got you questioning every move, making you more and more angry. Nat knocks you to the floor for the sixth time, finally making it the last.\u00a0\u201cWhat?!\u201d you say standing up wiping the faint blood trickling down your forehead.</p><p>\u201cYour bleeding Y/N. I\u2019m not gonna fight you. You need a break.\u201d Nat says making her way to you, but you back up not letting her touch you.\u00a0</p><p>You scoff,\u00a0\u201c I don\u2019t need shit. If you don\u2019t wanna fight get off the mat!\u201d You spat turning your back and looking at the bleachers for what seemed like the thousandth time.\u00a0\u201cSo! Who\u2019s next!\u201d you yelled annoyed that they haven\u2019t gotten the message that someone has to be on the mat with her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d you look down seeing Peter making his way towards you. You square up on the mat.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOk\u201d, You don\u2019t dare look Peter in the eye, avoiding his gaze at all costs.\u00a0Steve calls it and you start. You throw a punch and kick missing both times, this went on for awhile, Peter didn\u2019t get hit once and he didn\u2019t dare hit you, not wanting to cause you any kind of pain. All he did was dodge and you were the one trying to get him. It was getting you more worked up.\u00a0\u201cStop dodging! Fucking hit me Peter!\u201d You yell, Peter ignores your request and continues dodging each punch and kick. Until you lost it. You didn\u2019t know what came over you, it was like your breaking point and you couldn\u2019t control it. The huge energy ball came out of nowhere hurdling towards Peter. Steve was quick to grab Nat and pull her down, everyone else dropped to the floor taking shelter. You looked up seeing a huge hole in the wall.\u00a0\u201coh my god.\u201d You ran towards the wall, looking through it, you got out walking outside to see pieces of the wall scattered around the field. You looked around for Peter.\u00a0\u201cPETER!\u201d Your breathing quickened, you gasped for air.\u00a0\u201cPETER!\u201d Before you knew it there was a tap on your shoulder and you wipe your head around and see Peters face. He sensed the energy ball coming towards him and he quickly latched on the ceiling dodging the energy. You threw yourself at Peter.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Peter I\u2019m so so sorry, oh my god-\u201d Peter wrapped on arm around your waist and the other stroked your hair as you held him with your life.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine Y/N, I\u2019m fine.\u201d You pulled away, you felt the tears prickling your eyes. <i>NO YOU CAN\u2019T LET GO YOU CAN\u2019T!</i>\u00a0You looked at Peter, he noticed your glassy eyes. He brought one hand up to your cheek.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m okay Y/N\u201d he said softly, with a reassuring smile. And thats when you lost it, your body fell numb as your body collapsed, Peter wrapped his hand around your waist and fell to the ground with you. He hugged you on the ground as you let go. Your tears soaked up his shirt.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t, I-It hurts Peter. It hurts so bad.\u201d You sobbed, as all the feelings you kept locked up for the past five years came out. The tears ran down your face like a waterfall, it wouldn\u2019t stop. And you felt a weight being lifted off your shoulder. Peter stroked your back and just brought you closer to his body. \u201cP-peter, Im so sorry. I-I can\u2019t\u201d You soaked up in his shirt, grabbing everything he was giving you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI-It\u2019s okay Y/N,\u201d He kissed the side of your head.\u00a0You couldn\u2019t breathe, you pulled back trying to gasp for hair. Peters hand flys up to your face, stroking your cheek bones. He looks You in the eye and says \u201cLet it go,\u201d and thats exactly what you did. You yelled out in pain as Peter held you close. The rest of the team watched from afar, they held each other watching you cry on Peters shoulder. All there hearts breaking at the amount of pain you\u2019ve kept in, a 16 year old girl, there 16 year old girl should not be holding that much pain and that\u2019s when they finally realized everything you\u2019ve went through. Nat and Wanda were silently crying as the guys choked back there tears. Peter soon started to feel the tears running down his cheeks. He continued to hold you as you felt the world beating you down.\u00a0</p><p>After what seemed like a hours, everyone had gone inside awhile ago giving you space. You were just breathing heavy, having felt like you had no more tears to let out. Your eyes were red and puffy. Your head rested on Peters shoulder, your body in a tight ball on Peters lap. You soon fell asleep on his shoulder. It was already night time, so Peter picks you up and makes his way to your room. He passes by the team, Steve was talking to Tony, when Tony\u2019s eye caught your torn down body in Peter\u2019s arms. Peter could tell Tony had been crying\u2026 and drinking for awhile. The team noticed your sleeping figure and didn\u2019t dare make a sound. Except for Tony, he made his way to Peter, he halted his stance, no letting go of you, afraid to wake you up. Tony stood in front of Peter, looking down at his daughter. He pushed a few strands of hair from your face, placing a kiss on your forehead, before stepping out of the way, nodding to Peter.\u00a0</p><p>Peter carefully placed you on your bed, he tucked you under the blankets. Before he could walk away from the bed you grabbed his wrist. He looks down at you,\u00a0\u201cStay.\u201d you say weakly. Peter gives you a soft smile nodding his head. You slide over, making room for Peter. Peter pulls the blanket above both your bodies. You slide closer to him resting you head on his chest, taking in his scent. Peter wrapped his arm around your waist pulling you closer. You let out a sigh and fall into a deep sleep. Peter rubs small circles on your waist until he too falls asleep.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>A/N: I hope you guys liked Part 8, </p><p>Part 9 coming soon! </p></p>",

But that was not all.</p><p>Word Count: 4.3K</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"tommyhoelland2013:-I9WliiM0v_rPRz9AzMFWw:Zx1v4q2OQMBDl\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/56188347cdffb2be4ce3a07c8af80c7c/tumblr_otvnqiiw7f1sm6htko1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p>Josh was the only thing you were looking forward too when you woke up. Ever since your date, Josh has been doing something new with you everyday. You were mad a Bucky though. He refused to let you come along on missions, he even convinced the rest of the team somehow to agree on this. Even Peter! You were tired of this and spent most of your time with Josh instead.</p><p>Bucky ended up telling the team about the nightmares. Tony had the worst reaction, he isolated himself for two days, destroyed his room in the process. How could he not have seen this. He was your father, how could he have missed this. But Natasha helped him get through it telling him not to comfort you, knowing you would push them away if they did. Steve was in shock, he knew it happened ONCE, you told him it only happened once and they stopped. You told him. He should\u2019ve pushed up to tell him, he should\u2019ve done more. Clint and Bruce couldn\u2019t even process the information. Wanda cried, Vision held her. Sam was broken. Everyone knew, but no one could do anything.</p><p>Three weeks. Three weeks since you\u2019ve been on a mission but also three weeks you and Josh have been dating . And it was amazing. He held your hand in the hallways, kissed you by the lockers, walked you to every class, took you to lunch after school, if you weren\u2019t busy, and he would make you feel so special.</p><p>That was until he started becoming a little distant, it was Wednesday, and he barely talked to you after you guys hung out Sunday. He said he was busy. You were fine. Everything was fine. You know not to get attached to things, especially people. You hadn\u2019t fully trusted Josh and he hasn\u2019t fully trusted you so it\u2019s fine to have too spend some days just for yourself. That was until Wednesday in the cafeteria. You were talking to Mj and Ned who were sitting on either side of you, Flash and Peter were talking about the Spanish quiz tomorrow, they were sitting in front of you.</p><p>\u201cYou guys wanna do a Star Wars marathon this Friday?\u201d Ned asked with a huge smile.</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019m free.\u201d MJ says, then looking at you , so you could respond.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m free too.\u201d You say, you loved spending time with your friends. \u00a0You turn to Peter and Flash. \u201cYou guys in?\u201d They weren\u2019t looking at you, and they weren\u2019t talking, they were actually staring in shock at what was behind you. Ned turns behind to see what was happening and quickly looks between Peter and Flash. They both shake there heads \u2018no\u2019. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d You say turning to see what they were looking at. But before you could see anything, Peter jumps over the table standing in front of you, so you could only see his chest. \u201cWhat\u2019s up Peter, move.\u201d You were annoyed and confused at why he suddenly moved to block your path. You stand up, trying to get Peter to move. It was getting annoying. \u201cPeter, what the fuck, just move.\u201d Flash comes by Peter holding your shoulders.</p><p>\u201cY/N, it-its not a big deal.\u201d Flash says, sadness covered his face and so did Peter\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s not a big deal then why can\u2019t I see.\u201d Peter and Flash both stood side by side blocking your view. That\u2019s it, you pushed both of them to the side, using a little force from your powers, (the energy in your powers could make you stronger when you wanted too). But you instantly regretted it. There he was. Josh, his hands around another girls shoulder, they were making out, for a long time. The whole entire cafeteria fell silent, when they saw Y/N Stark standing in shock with her two friends not knowing what to do. The silence caught Josh\u2019s attention, he made eye contact with you. You didn\u2019t know what you were feeling. You could feel the heat rising in your hands. Peter saw you tense, and he looked down at your hands, they were starting to light up. He quickly moved past Flash, taking your hands in his. You didn\u2019t move. Your eyes were still locked on Josh\u2019s. Josh was frozen. He knew he fucked up big time. He got out of his table and started walking towards you.</p><p>\u201cY/N, its-its not what it looks like, let me explain-\u201d He was about to reach for your shoulder, but Peter was quick to turn around and punch him. knocking him to the floor as he grabbed his eye. Peter was going to go for another punch until he felt Flash holding him back.</p><p>\u201cNot here man- not here.\u201d Flash whispers to Peter, pushing him back to you. You still hadn\u2019t moved. You were still trying to figure out what your were feeling. Peter on the other hand knew exactly what he felt, anger. He knew this would happen, he knew Josh wouldn\u2019t treat you like you wanted him too. He could feel his blood boiling. When he saw Josh standing up and making his way to him, Peter was just about ready to kill the guy until Flash stepped in. He pushed Josh back. \u201cGet the fuck away from here, before you start something you regret dumbass.\u201d Flash pushes Josh back. Peter was standing in front of you, Flash was defending you, Mj was holding your hand and Ned was rubbing your back, the cafeteria was staring, some people were even filming it. It was too much. That\u2019s one thing you knew. You can\u2019t be here. You can\u2019t be here.</p><p>You push past everyone heading for the door leaving your bag and phone and everything, your only focus was on getting out of there. You ran down the hall, pushing the schools front doors open as Peter chased you down the hall, calling your name. But you ignored it, the sound muffled as a million things raced through your head. You unchained your bike and quickly rode out of the school onto the busy streets of NYC, leaving Peter standing in front of the school, pulling at his hair.</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>You didn\u2019t stop, you kept riding, you went straight, right, left, anywhere, anywhere that wasn\u2019t there. You finally get to the edge of New York City. You were by the ocean, you don\u2019t know which park this was, and you didn\u2019t care. At least no one was here. You dropped your bike by the sand and sat down by the ocean . And you looked out.</p><p>The waves crashing down, as the wind breezed through your hair. The sun beating on your face. You lay your head back on the sand, as you closed your eyes soaking up the sun and its heat. You weren\u2019t crying, you weren\u2019t yelling, you weren\u2019t feeling. Your closed. Your done.</p><p>You watched the sun set, admiring the beautiful colors in the sky. You forgot about time and day. You just watched the sun. That\u2019s it. Nothing else was in your head, Just the sun. The sun now over the arisen, stars started to pop up in the sky and you focused on that then. You looked for the constellations that you remembered as a kid. Your dad use to take you to the roof of the Stark Tower, when it was the Stark Tower, and he would lay a blanket and you guys would just lay there finding constellations. It\u2019s been years since you sat quietly and looked for constellations. You then fell asleep looking up at the night sky.</p><p><i>\u201cFuck. You.\u201d you say. Staring the man dead in the eye. He goes for another punch, this time to the face. You take the hit and spit the blood out on the side. You were tied down to a chair, your wrists and legs bound to the chair, with the \u2018handcuffs\u2019. You couldn\u2019t break from them no matter how much energy you tried to release, it wouldn\u2019t d even let your fingertips heat up.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThis will keep going, the more you resist, the more you disobey, the more pain we\u2019ll cause. Simple as that.\u201d The man says, going over to the table behind him grabbing another tool. Hey presses it against your naked stomach, only wearing a bra and panties. You bit your lip in pain, not wanting him to feel the satisfaction in your cries, you smell the burning flesh and you can feel your skin bubbling. He retracks the tool, you breathe out, taking in deep breathes.</i></p><p><i>This wasn\u2019t new for you, you acted out, you shouldn\u2019t have, but you did. They killed your cell neighbor the only person you could take too at night. You guys spent the nights talking about your old lives. Even though there was a wall between you guys, you still cared about him. He was like an older brother to you, he usually stopped the guard\u2019s from touching you. He got most of them away, but not all of them. At night a few guard\u2019s would come into your cell and touch you, and sexually assault you. You would cry out in pain as Wade screamed from his cell for them to stop. His name was Wade Wilson, he made your days there better, with his funny as hell jokes and random commentary. The day they took him down to the basement and never returned him you knew what they did. \u00a0 \u00a0</i></p><p><i>The man placed the tool down and picked up the needle. Your eyes wide and you started to shake your head violently. They gave you those needles often, and they were the worst pain ever. \u201cNo, no please. Please, one more chance please just don\u2019t-\u201d before you could finish your sentence, the needle made contact with your skin, the blue liquid entering your bloodstream. The pain coursed through your body and your scream erupted. </i></p><p>Your body shots up, your hand coming to your chest feeling your heart beating at lighting speed. You look up to see the sun rising, you start taking deep breathes, focusing on the sun, trying to relax your mind. You rub your eyes, as you look around. There were a few people passing by staring at you, some taking pictures of Y/N Stark sleeping on the sand. You ignore it though, your eyes moving back to the sun. </p><p>You wait until the sun has fully risen, until you start to push yourself onto your feet. You pat some of the sand off you, as you pick your bike up, swinging your leg over the seat and start peddling. You pass by the cars, and yelling people making there way to work. </p><p>The Avenger\u2019s compound then comes into view and you keep pedaling until you rest your bike against the wall and walk in. You kick your shoes off, you make your way to the comman area to get to your room. You find everyone suited up yelling at each other. You ignore it, you see your bag on the floor and go over to pick it up and you start to make your way to your room. No one seemed to notice you until </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s back.\u201d Peter says, sighing in relief. Everyone turns around to see you walking away. Tony pushes through everyone and calls your name out. </p><p>\u201cY/N, Y/N!\u201d but you continue to walk, not wanting to deal with this right now. \u201cY/N where were you! We were going to send out everyone to look for you! Hey!\u201d Your eyes are focused on the hallway. You finally make it to your room and slam it shut, tapping the screen next to the door so the door locks. You hear your dads footsteps finally making it to your room. He goes to turn the knob to find it locked. \u201cY/N-Y/N! Open the door!\u201d You drop your bag on the floor and look to your clock on 12:45pm. You make your way to the bathroom washing your face. You still hear the banging on your door and your dad calling your name from behind it.</p><p>Steve makes his way down the hall to see an angry Tony banging on your door, yelling your name. He comes over and places a hand on his shoulder. \u201cLeave her. She\u2019ll come out-\u201d Tony cuts Steve off.</p><p>\u201cNo, she fucking disappeared from the school, she didn\u2019t even come home. Where the fuck was she! For all I knew she could\u2019ve been taken! S-she could\u2019ve been l-lying dead somewhere.\u201d Tony couldn\u2019t even get the words out before a sob left his mouth. Steve looked at Tony, his heart shattering to a million pieces to see his friend in this state. The only person that could make him like this was you. He thought you were dead. Steve dragged Tony to his office, not wanting the rest of the team to see Tony like this. Tony went to his scotch pouring himself a drink and taking a swing. Steve let it happen, he knew Tony went through a lot today. </p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>You went to your closet about two hours later, pulling on a pair of sports shorts, and sports bra and throwing a tank-top over it. You put your Nikes on and grab your gym bag as you leave your room. The compound was silent, but you didn\u2019t care. Your face expressionless, your heart feeling cold as ice. You couldn\u2019t feel anything. You made your way to the training room. </p><p>The training room was practically a gym, there was a huge mat placed at the center, where you guys often spared each other in. There were weights around the edge, and boxing bags lined in a row, there were other equipment as well. You go to the bleachers dropping your bag down and opening the bag. You take out your boxing tap and you start wrapping them around your hands. </p><p>\u201cFRIDAY play my workout playlist.\u201d You yell. FRIDAY plays the music, it echos through the gym walls. You tell FRIDAY to higher the volume, so that\u2019s the only thing you could hear. You move to the boxing bag, and you start punching. Your punches becoming stronger with each throw, all the anger you kept in starting to leak out. And you let it. </p><p>Your hands starting to heat up and they started to glow, with one last punch you send the bag flying across the room. You move to grab another bag, hanging it up and continuing. You don\u2019t know how long you\u2019ve been in the training room, until you hear someone speak from behind you.</p><p>\u201cWanna talk about it.\u201d <i>Steve. </i>You continue punching the bag. </p><p>\u201cNo- theres - nothing - too - talk - about!\u201d The bag flies across the room. You go over and hang up another bag. Steve looks around the room noticing about twenty bags laying around the room. Steve knew you don\u2019t like talking about shit like that so he did what he knew you\u2019d agree on doing.</p><p>\u201cOk\u2026 how about we take break from boxing, and spare?\u201d Your punches hesitated, knowing what he was trying to do. You continue punching the bag. \u201cC\u2019mon Y/N, me and you. You haven\u2019t been on the field for awhile. Let\u2019s see what you\u2019ve got.\u201d You stopped your punches holding the bag so it wouldn\u2019t swing back and hit you. You turn around, Steve notices the anger in your eyes. He could see your hands balled in fists. He\u2019s never seen you like this. And it scared him a little. </p><p>\u201cAnd who\u2019s fault is that, Huh?! Oh yea it was everyone\u2019s ! All of you said I couldn\u2019t go on missions anymore!\u201d You unwrap the tape around your hands and throw them behind you, making your way to the mat, in the middle of the room. You stand in the middle putting your hands up in guard. \u201cYou wanna see what I\u2019ve got, c\u2019mon. I\u2019m ready!\u201d Steve hesitated a bit, this wasn\u2019t such a good idea. When sparing, it\u2019s usually hand to hand combat meaning no powers. Rules were don\u2019t kill each other and if the other person says stop it\u2019s over. Other than that, everything else is fine. </p><p>\u201cRemember the rules?\u201d Steve says making his way to you. He just wanted to make sure you weren\u2019t going to kill him.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know the fucking rules!\u201d You spat, annoyed with absolutely everything at this point. Steve brushed off your attitude and nodded his head. Steve stands in front of you putting his hands up in guard. </p><p>\u201cOk, lets go.\u201d You were quick to through the first punch, which was not like you, you get Steve right in jaw. Steve hesitates a bit, taken aback by the sudden anger filling you. You and Steve go back an forth, Steve was mostly on defensive not wanting to hurt you when your in this state. People started coming into the room taking a seat on the bleachers. You caught a few people from the corner of your eye, Peter, Clint and Nat were sitting in the first row, Sam and Rhodey behind them, Wanda came in shortly after and not surprising Vision comes in behind her. You then notice Bucky enter , but ignore him, still annoyed about what he did. But you didn\u2019t focus on them, it was only on Steve. The more punches and kicks you threw the more you grew angry. Your blood was boiling. When Steve makes you loose your balance, falling on your back, you let out a grunt. Steve jogs up to you ready to pick you up.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d you say pushing his hands away and standing up quickly going back to guard. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Steve looks at your fists, your nails digging into your palms. He shakes his head \u2018no\u2019. \u201cWhat?!\u201d You say frustrated. It was his damn idea. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done Y/N. Lets take a break-\u201d You turn away from Steve and face the bleachers. </p><p>You raise your hands up, \u201cAnyone care to spare!\u201d You yell eyeing everyone. They all exchange looks, they could see your distressed figure, but if this was the only way you wanted to communicate then so be it. Sam was the first to stand up. He makes his way to you rolling up his sleeves. \u201cOk\u2026Lets go\u201d Steve nods at Sam, and you guys start fighting. You and Sam go back and forth for about thirty minutes, it was long. Until Sam notices how this wasn\u2019t any good and you catch him off guard knocking him off his feet, his back hitting the floor. \u201cC\u2019mon, get up.\u201d Sam rolls over standing back up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done Y/N\u201d you roll your eyes and turn back to the bleachers. </p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s next!\u201d Clint stands up making his way to you. Clint often trained you, most of your fight combinations you learned were from him. You nod your head, Steve calls it and you guys start fighting. Every hit fueled your anger, every punch you threw was building up your anger and frustration. You just wanted to let go, but you couldn\u2019t. You pushed through it, and kept fighting. Clint knocked you and you stubbled back, but not completely falling. Clint calls it though. Wanda takes his place. She then drops and Vision comes in. After Vision. Bucky then offers to fight.\u00a0\u201cNo.\u201d Everyone looks at you, you said you wanted to fight. You did but not Bucky. Bucky silently sat back down.</p><p>By the time you got to Nat, you wouldn\u2019t even look anyone in the eye, your head feeling like it was going to explode. Your hands were up ready to start fighting Nat, but Steve quickly grabs your hands. You look up at him your eyebrows furrowed.\u00a0\u201cWhat?!\u201d You say struggling to get out of his grip.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo. Powers.\u201d He said, you look down at your hands, they were about to let an energy ball out. You nodd your head.</p><p>\u201cYea I know. Sorry. I\u2019m fine. Let. go.\u201d You say not loosing your stern voice. Steve lets go backing up. He yells start, Nat throws the first kick, and you guys fight. You always hated fighting Nat and Steve, they were always the hardest, and they fueled you up. they knocked you down and got you questioning every move, making you more and more angry. Nat knocks you to the floor for the sixth time, finally making it the last.\u00a0\u201cWhat?!\u201d you say standing up wiping the faint blood trickling down your forehead.</p><p>\u201cYour bleeding Y/N. I\u2019m not gonna fight you. You need a break.\u201d Nat says making her way to you, but you back up not letting her touch you.\u00a0</p><p>You scoff,\u00a0\u201c I don\u2019t need shit. If you don\u2019t wanna fight get off the mat!\u201d You spat turning your back and looking at the bleachers for what seemed like the thousandth time.\u00a0\u201cSo! Who\u2019s next!\u201d you yelled annoyed that they haven\u2019t gotten the message that someone has to be on the mat with her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d you look down seeing Peter making his way towards you. You square up on the mat.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOk\u201d, You don\u2019t dare look Peter in the eye, avoiding his gaze at all costs.\u00a0Steve calls it and you start. You throw a punch and kick missing both times, this went on for awhile, Peter didn\u2019t get hit once and he didn\u2019t dare hit you, not wanting to cause you any kind of pain. All he did was dodge and you were the one trying to get him. It was getting you more worked up.\u00a0\u201cStop dodging! Fucking hit me Peter!\u201d You yell, Peter ignores your request and continues dodging each punch and kick. Until you lost it. You didn\u2019t know what came over you, it was like your breaking point and you couldn\u2019t control it. The huge energy ball came out of nowhere hurdling towards Peter. Steve was quick to grab Nat and pull her down, everyone else dropped to the floor taking shelter. You looked up seeing a huge hole in the wall.\u00a0\u201coh my god.\u201d You ran towards the wall, looking through it, you got out walking outside to see pieces of the wall scattered around the field. You looked around for Peter.\u00a0\u201cPETER!\u201d Your breathing quickened, you gasped for air.\u00a0\u201cPETER!\u201d Before you knew it there was a tap on your shoulder and you wipe your head around and see Peters face. He sensed the energy ball coming towards him and he quickly latched on the ceiling dodging the energy. You threw yourself at Peter.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Peter I\u2019m so so sorry, oh my god-\u201d Peter wrapped on arm around your waist and the other stroked your hair as you held him with your life.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine Y/N, I\u2019m fine.\u201d You pulled away, you felt the tears prickling your eyes. <i>NO YOU CAN\u2019T LET GO YOU CAN\u2019T!</i>\u00a0You looked at Peter, he noticed your glassy eyes. He brought one hand up to your cheek.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m okay Y/N\u201d he said softly, with a reassuring smile. And thats when you lost it, your body fell numb as your body collapsed, Peter wrapped his hand around your waist and fell to the ground with you. He hugged you on the ground as you let go. Your tears soaked up his shirt.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t, I-It hurts Peter. It hurts so bad.\u201d You sobbed, as all the feelings you kept locked up for the past five years came out. The tears ran down your face like a waterfall, it wouldn\u2019t stop. And you felt a weight being lifted off your shoulder. Peter stroked your back and just brought you closer to his body. \u201cP-peter, Im so sorry. I-I can\u2019t\u201d You soaked up in his shirt, grabbing everything he was giving you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI-It\u2019s okay Y/N,\u201d He kissed the side of your head.\u00a0You couldn\u2019t breathe, you pulled back trying to gasp for hair. Peters hand flys up to your face, stroking your cheek bones. He looks You in the eye and says \u201cLet it go,\u201d and thats exactly what you did. You yelled out in pain as Peter held you close. The rest of the team watched from afar, they held each other watching you cry on Peters shoulder. All there hearts breaking at the amount of pain you\u2019ve kept in, a 16 year old girl, there 16 year old girl should not be holding that much pain and that\u2019s when they finally realized everything you\u2019ve went through. Nat and Wanda were silently crying as the guys choked back there tears. Peter soon started to feel the tears running down his cheeks. He continued to hold you as you felt the world beating you down.\u00a0</p><p>After what seemed like a hours, everyone had gone inside awhile ago giving you space. You were just breathing heavy, having felt like you had no more tears to let out. Your eyes were red and puffy. Your head rested on Peters shoulder, your body in a tight ball on Peters lap. You soon fell asleep on his shoulder. It was already night time, so Peter picks you up and makes his way to your room. He passes by the team, Steve was talking to Tony, when Tony\u2019s eye caught your torn down body in Peter\u2019s arms. Peter could tell Tony had been crying\u2026 and drinking for awhile. The team noticed your sleeping figure and didn\u2019t dare make a sound. Except for Tony, he made his way to Peter, he halted his stance, no letting go of you, afraid to wake you up. Tony stood in front of Peter, looking down at his daughter. He pushed a few strands of hair from your face, placing a kiss on your forehead, before stepping out of the way, nodding to Peter.\u00a0</p><p>Peter carefully placed you on your bed, he tucked you under the blankets. Before he could walk away from the bed you grabbed his wrist. He looks down at you,\u00a0\u201cStay.\u201d you say weakly. Peter gives you a soft smile nodding his head. You slide over, making room for Peter. Peter pulls the blanket above both your bodies. You slide closer to him resting you head on his chest, taking in his scent. Peter wrapped his arm around your waist pulling you closer. You let out a sigh and fall into a deep sleep. Peter rubs small circles on your waist until he too falls asleep.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>A/N: I hope you guys liked Part 8, </p><p>Part 9 coming soon! </p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>Finally Found My Way</h1><p>Part 8</p><p>Warning: language, anxiety, violence, sexual assault </p><p>Summary: After four years of being tortured by hydra, you were finally back, yours powers stronger than ever. But that was not all.</p><p>Word Count: 4.3K</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>Josh was the only thing you were looking forward too when you woke up. Ever since your date, Josh has been doing something new with you everyday. You were mad a Bucky though. He refused to let you come along on missions, he even convinced the rest of the team somehow to agree on this. Even Peter! You were tired of this and spent most of your time with Josh instead.</p><p>Bucky ended up telling the team about the nightmares. Tony had the worst reaction, he isolated himself for two days, destroyed his room in the process. How could he not have seen this. He was your father, how could he have missed this. But Natasha helped him get through it telling him not to comfort you, knowing you would push them away if they did. Steve was in shock, he knew it happened ONCE, you told him it only happened once and they stopped. You told him. He should&rsquo;ve pushed up to tell him, he should&rsquo;ve done more. Clint and Bruce couldn&rsquo;t even process the information. Wanda cried, Vision held her. Sam was broken. Everyone knew, but no one could do anything.</p><p>Three weeks. Three weeks since you&rsquo;ve been on a mission but also three weeks you and Josh have been dating . And it was amazing. He held your hand in the hallways, kissed you by the lockers, walked you to every class, took you to lunch after school, if you weren&rsquo;t busy, and he would make you feel so special.</p><p>That was until he started becoming a little distant, it was Wednesday, and he barely talked to you after you guys hung out Sunday. He said he was busy. You were fine. Everything was fine. You know not to get attached to things, especially people. You hadn&rsquo;t fully trusted Josh and he hasn&rsquo;t fully trusted you so it&rsquo;s fine to have too spend some days just for yourself. That was until Wednesday in the cafeteria. You were talking to Mj and Ned who were sitting on either side of you, Flash and Peter were talking about the Spanish quiz tomorrow, they were sitting in front of you.</p><p>&ldquo;You guys wanna do a Star Wars marathon this Friday?&rdquo; Ned asked with a huge smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;m free.&rdquo; MJ says, then looking at you , so you could respond.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;m free too.&rdquo; You say, you loved spending time with your friends. &nbsp;You turn to Peter and Flash. &ldquo;You guys in?&rdquo; They weren&rsquo;t looking at you, and they weren&rsquo;t talking, they were actually staring in shock at what was behind you. Ned turns behind to see what was happening and quickly looks between Peter and Flash. They both shake there heads &lsquo;no&rsquo;. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; You say turning to see what they were looking at. But before you could see anything, Peter jumps over the table standing in front of you, so you could only see his chest. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up Peter, move.&rdquo; You were annoyed and confused at why he suddenly moved to block your path. You stand up, trying to get Peter to move. It was getting annoying. &ldquo;Peter, what the fuck, just move.&rdquo; Flash comes by Peter holding your shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, it-its not a big deal.&rdquo; Flash says, sadness covered his face and so did Peter&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s not a big deal then why can&rsquo;t I see.&rdquo; Peter and Flash both stood side by side blocking your view. That&rsquo;s it, you pushed both of them to the side, using a little force from your powers, (the energy in your powers could make you stronger when you wanted too). But you instantly regretted it. There he was. Josh, his hands around another girls shoulder, they were making out, for a long time. The whole entire cafeteria fell silent, when they saw Y/N Stark standing in shock with her two friends not knowing what to do. The silence caught Josh&rsquo;s attention, he made eye contact with you. You didn&rsquo;t know what you were feeling. You could feel the heat rising in your hands. Peter saw you tense, and he looked down at your hands, they were starting to light up. He quickly moved past Flash, taking your hands in his. You didn&rsquo;t move. Your eyes were still locked on Josh&rsquo;s. Josh was frozen. He knew he fucked up big time. He got out of his table and started walking towards you.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, its-its not what it looks like, let me explain-&rdquo; He was about to reach for your shoulder, but Peter was quick to turn around and punch him. knocking him to the floor as he grabbed his eye. Peter was going to go for another punch until he felt Flash holding him back.</p><p>&ldquo;Not here man- not here.&rdquo; Flash whispers to Peter, pushing him back to you. You still hadn&rsquo;t moved. You were still trying to figure out what your were feeling. Peter on the other hand knew exactly what he felt, anger. He knew this would happen, he knew Josh wouldn&rsquo;t treat you like you wanted him too. He could feel his blood boiling. When he saw Josh standing up and making his way to him, Peter was just about ready to kill the guy until Flash stepped in. He pushed Josh back. &ldquo;Get the fuck away from here, before you start something you regret dumbass.&rdquo; Flash pushes Josh back. Peter was standing in front of you, Flash was defending you, Mj was holding your hand and Ned was rubbing your back, the cafeteria was staring, some people were even filming it. It was too much. That&rsquo;s one thing you knew. You can&rsquo;t be here. You can&rsquo;t be here.</p><p>You push past everyone heading for the door leaving your bag and phone and everything, your only focus was on getting out of there. You ran down the hall, pushing the schools front doors open as Peter chased you down the hall, calling your name. But you ignored it, the sound muffled as a million things raced through your head. You unchained your bike and quickly rode out of the school onto the busy streets of NYC, leaving Peter standing in front of the school, pulling at his hair.</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t stop, you kept riding, you went straight, right, left, anywhere, anywhere that wasn&rsquo;t there. You finally get to the edge of New York City. You were by the ocean, you don&rsquo;t know which park this was, and you didn&rsquo;t care. At least no one was here. You dropped your bike by the sand and sat down by the ocean . And you looked out.</p><p>The waves crashing down, as the wind breezed through your hair. The sun beating on your face. You lay your head back on the sand, as you closed your eyes soaking up the sun and its heat. You weren&rsquo;t crying, you weren&rsquo;t yelling, you weren&rsquo;t feeling. Your closed. Your done.</p><p>You watched the sun set, admiring the beautiful colors in the sky. You forgot about time and day. You just watched the sun. That&rsquo;s it. Nothing else was in your head, Just the sun. The sun now over the arisen, stars started to pop up in the sky and you focused on that then. You looked for the constellations that you remembered as a kid. Your dad use to take you to the roof of the Stark Tower, when it was the Stark Tower, and he would lay a blanket and you guys would just lay there finding constellations. It&rsquo;s been years since you sat quietly and looked for constellations. You then fell asleep looking up at the night sky.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Fuck. You.&rdquo; you say. Staring the man dead in the eye. He goes for another punch, this time to the face. You take the hit and spit the blood out on the side. You were tied down to a chair, your wrists and legs bound to the chair, with the &lsquo;handcuffs&rsquo;. You couldn&rsquo;t break from them no matter how much energy you tried to release, it wouldn&rsquo;t d even let your fingertips heat up.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;This will keep going, the more you resist, the more you disobey, the more pain we&rsquo;ll cause. Simple as that.&rdquo; The man says, going over to the table behind him grabbing another tool. Hey presses it against your naked stomach, only wearing a bra and panties. You bit your lip in pain, not wanting him to feel the satisfaction in your cries, you smell the burning flesh and you can feel your skin bubbling. He retracks the tool, you breathe out, taking in deep breathes.</i></p><p><i>This wasn&rsquo;t new for you, you acted out, you shouldn&rsquo;t have, but you did. They killed your cell neighbor the only person you could take too at night. You guys spent the nights talking about your old lives. Even though there was a wall between you guys, you still cared about him. He was like an older brother to you, he usually stopped the guard&rsquo;s from touching you. He got most of them away, but not all of them. At night a few guard&rsquo;s would come into your cell and touch you, and sexually assault you. You would cry out in pain as Wade screamed from his cell for them to stop. His name was Wade Wilson, he made your days there better, with his funny as hell jokes and random commentary. The day they took him down to the basement and never returned him you knew what they did. &nbsp; &nbsp;</i></p><p><i>The man placed the tool down and picked up the needle. Your eyes wide and you started to shake your head violently. They gave you those needles often, and they were the worst pain ever. &ldquo;No, no please. Please, one more chance please just don&rsquo;t-&rdquo; before you could finish your sentence, the needle made contact with your skin, the blue liquid entering your bloodstream. The pain coursed through your body and your scream erupted. </i></p><p>Your body shots up, your hand coming to your chest feeling your heart beating at lighting speed. You look up to see the sun rising, you start taking deep breathes, focusing on the sun, trying to relax your mind. You rub your eyes, as you look around. There were a few people passing by staring at you, some taking pictures of Y/N Stark sleeping on the sand. You ignore it though, your eyes moving back to the sun. </p><p>You wait until the sun has fully risen, until you start to push yourself onto your feet. You pat some of the sand off you, as you pick your bike up, swinging your leg over the seat and start peddling. You pass by the cars, and yelling people making there way to work. </p><p>The Avenger&rsquo;s compound then comes into view and you keep pedaling until you rest your bike against the wall and walk in. You kick your shoes off, you make your way to the comman area to get to your room. You find everyone suited up yelling at each other. You ignore it, you see your bag on the floor and go over to pick it up and you start to make your way to your room. No one seemed to notice you until </p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s back.&rdquo; Peter says, sighing in relief. Everyone turns around to see you walking away. Tony pushes through everyone and calls your name out. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, Y/N!&rdquo; but you continue to walk, not wanting to deal with this right now. &ldquo;Y/N where were you! We were going to send out everyone to look for you! Hey!&rdquo; Your eyes are focused on the hallway. You finally make it to your room and slam it shut, tapping the screen next to the door so the door locks. You hear your dads footsteps finally making it to your room. He goes to turn the knob to find it locked. &ldquo;Y/N-Y/N! Open the door!&rdquo; You drop your bag on the floor and look to your clock on 12:45pm. You make your way to the bathroom washing your face. You still hear the banging on your door and your dad calling your name from behind it.</p><p>Steve makes his way down the hall to see an angry Tony banging on your door, yelling your name. He comes over and places a hand on his shoulder. &ldquo;Leave her. She&rsquo;ll come out-&rdquo; Tony cuts Steve off.</p><p>&ldquo;No, she fucking disappeared from the school, she didn&rsquo;t even come home. Where the fuck was she! For all I knew she could&rsquo;ve been taken! S-she could&rsquo;ve been l-lying dead somewhere.&rdquo; Tony couldn&rsquo;t even get the words out before a sob left his mouth. Steve looked at Tony, his heart shattering to a million pieces to see his friend in this state. The only person that could make him like this was you. He thought you were dead. Steve dragged Tony to his office, not wanting the rest of the team to see Tony like this. Tony went to his scotch pouring himself a drink and taking a swing. Steve let it happen, he knew Tony went through a lot today. </p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>You went to your closet about two hours later, pulling on a pair of sports shorts, and sports bra and throwing a tank-top over it. You put your Nikes on and grab your gym bag as you leave your room. The compound was silent, but you didn&rsquo;t care. Your face expressionless, your heart feeling cold as ice. You couldn&rsquo;t feel anything. You made your way to the training room. </p><p>The training room was practically a gym, there was a huge mat placed at the center, where you guys often spared each other in. There were weights around the edge, and boxing bags lined in a row, there were other equipment as well. You go to the bleachers dropping your bag down and opening the bag. You take out your boxing tap and you start wrapping them around your hands. </p><p>&ldquo;FRIDAY play my workout playlist.&rdquo; You yell. FRIDAY plays the music, it echos through the gym walls. You tell FRIDAY to higher the volume, so that&rsquo;s the only thing you could hear. You move to the boxing bag, and you start punching. Your punches becoming stronger with each throw, all the anger you kept in starting to leak out. And you let it. </p><p>Your hands starting to heat up and they started to glow, with one last punch you send the bag flying across the room. You move to grab another bag, hanging it up and continuing. You don&rsquo;t know how long you&rsquo;ve been in the training room, until you hear someone speak from behind you.</p><p>&ldquo;Wanna talk about it.&rdquo; <i>Steve. </i>You continue punching the bag. </p><p>&ldquo;No- theres - nothing - too - talk - about!&rdquo; The bag flies across the room. You go over and hang up another bag. Steve looks around the room noticing about twenty bags laying around the room. Steve knew you don&rsquo;t like talking about shit like that so he did what he knew you&rsquo;d agree on doing.</p><p>&ldquo;Ok&hellip; how about we take break from boxing, and spare?&rdquo; Your punches hesitated, knowing what he was trying to do. You continue punching the bag. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon Y/N, me and you. You haven&rsquo;t been on the field for awhile. Let&rsquo;s see what you&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo; You stopped your punches holding the bag so it wouldn&rsquo;t swing back and hit you. You turn around, Steve notices the anger in your eyes. He could see your hands balled in fists. He&rsquo;s never seen you like this. And it scared him a little. </p><p>&ldquo;And who&rsquo;s fault is that, Huh?! Oh yea it was everyone&rsquo;s ! All of you said I couldn&rsquo;t go on missions anymore!&rdquo; You unwrap the tape around your hands and throw them behind you, making your way to the mat, in the middle of the room. You stand in the middle putting your hands up in guard. &ldquo;You wanna see what I&rsquo;ve got, c&rsquo;mon. I&rsquo;m ready!&rdquo; Steve hesitated a bit, this wasn&rsquo;t such a good idea. When sparing, it&rsquo;s usually hand to hand combat meaning no powers. Rules were don&rsquo;t kill each other and if the other person says stop it&rsquo;s over. Other than that, everything else is fine. </p><p>&ldquo;Remember the rules?&rdquo; Steve says making his way to you. He just wanted to make sure you weren&rsquo;t going to kill him.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I know the fucking rules!&rdquo; You spat, annoyed with absolutely everything at this point. Steve brushed off your attitude and nodded his head. Steve stands in front of you putting his hands up in guard. </p><p>&ldquo;Ok, lets go.&rdquo; You were quick to through the first punch, which was not like you, you get Steve right in jaw. Steve hesitates a bit, taken aback by the sudden anger filling you. You and Steve go back an forth, Steve was mostly on defensive not wanting to hurt you when your in this state. People started coming into the room taking a seat on the bleachers. You caught a few people from the corner of your eye, Peter, Clint and Nat were sitting in the first row, Sam and Rhodey behind them, Wanda came in shortly after and not surprising Vision comes in behind her. You then notice Bucky enter , but ignore him, still annoyed about what he did. But you didn&rsquo;t focus on them, it was only on Steve. The more punches and kicks you threw the more you grew angry. Your blood was boiling. When Steve makes you loose your balance, falling on your back, you let out a grunt. Steve jogs up to you ready to pick you up.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch me!&rdquo; you say pushing his hands away and standing up quickly going back to guard. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; Steve looks at your fists, your nails digging into your palms. He shakes his head &lsquo;no&rsquo;. &ldquo;What?!&rdquo; You say frustrated. It was his damn idea. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m done Y/N. Lets take a break-&rdquo; You turn away from Steve and face the bleachers. </p><p>You raise your hands up, &ldquo;Anyone care to spare!&rdquo; You yell eyeing everyone. They all exchange looks, they could see your distressed figure, but if this was the only way you wanted to communicate then so be it. Sam was the first to stand up. He makes his way to you rolling up his sleeves. &ldquo;Ok&hellip;Lets go&rdquo; Steve nods at Sam, and you guys start fighting. You and Sam go back and forth for about thirty minutes, it was long. Until Sam notices how this wasn&rsquo;t any good and you catch him off guard knocking him off his feet, his back hitting the floor. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, get up.&rdquo; Sam rolls over standing back up.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m done Y/N&rdquo; you roll your eyes and turn back to the bleachers. </p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s next!&rdquo; Clint stands up making his way to you. Clint often trained you, most of your fight combinations you learned were from him. You nod your head, Steve calls it and you guys start fighting. Every hit fueled your anger, every punch you threw was building up your anger and frustration. You just wanted to let go, but you couldn&rsquo;t. You pushed through it, and kept fighting. Clint knocked you and you stubbled back, but not completely falling. Clint calls it though. Wanda takes his place. She then drops and Vision comes in. After Vision. Bucky then offers to fight.&nbsp;&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Everyone looks at you, you said you wanted to fight. You did but not Bucky. Bucky silently sat back down.</p><p>By the time you got to Nat, you wouldn&rsquo;t even look anyone in the eye, your head feeling like it was going to explode. Your hands were up ready to start fighting Nat, but Steve quickly grabs your hands. You look up at him your eyebrows furrowed.&nbsp;&ldquo;What?!&rdquo; You say struggling to get out of his grip.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;No. Powers.&rdquo; He said, you look down at your hands, they were about to let an energy ball out. You nodd your head.</p><p>&ldquo;Yea I know. Sorry. I&rsquo;m fine. Let. go.&rdquo; You say not loosing your stern voice. Steve lets go backing up. He yells start, Nat throws the first kick, and you guys fight. You always hated fighting Nat and Steve, they were always the hardest, and they fueled you up. they knocked you down and got you questioning every move, making you more and more angry. Nat knocks you to the floor for the sixth time, finally making it the last.&nbsp;&ldquo;What?!&rdquo; you say standing up wiping the faint blood trickling down your forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;Your bleeding Y/N. I&rsquo;m not gonna fight you. You need a break.&rdquo; Nat says making her way to you, but you back up not letting her touch you.&nbsp;</p><p>You scoff,&nbsp;&ldquo; I don&rsquo;t need shit. If you don&rsquo;t wanna fight get off the mat!&rdquo; You spat turning your back and looking at the bleachers for what seemed like the thousandth time.&nbsp;&ldquo;So! Who&rsquo;s next!&rdquo; you yelled annoyed that they haven&rsquo;t gotten the message that someone has to be on the mat with her.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Me,&rdquo; you look down seeing Peter making his way towards you. You square up on the mat.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok&rdquo;, You don&rsquo;t dare look Peter in the eye, avoiding his gaze at all costs.&nbsp;Steve calls it and you start. You throw a punch and kick missing both times, this went on for awhile, Peter didn&rsquo;t get hit once and he didn&rsquo;t dare hit you, not wanting to cause you any kind of pain. All he did was dodge and you were the one trying to get him. It was getting you more worked up.&nbsp;&ldquo;Stop dodging! Fucking hit me Peter!&rdquo; You yell, Peter ignores your request and continues dodging each punch and kick. Until you lost it. You didn&rsquo;t know what came over you, it was like your breaking point and you couldn&rsquo;t control it. The huge energy ball came out of nowhere hurdling towards Peter. Steve was quick to grab Nat and pull her down, everyone else dropped to the floor taking shelter. You looked up seeing a huge hole in the wall.&nbsp;&ldquo;oh my god.&rdquo; You ran towards the wall, looking through it, you got out walking outside to see pieces of the wall scattered around the field. You looked around for Peter.&nbsp;&ldquo;PETER!&rdquo; Your breathing quickened, you gasped for air.&nbsp;&ldquo;PETER!&rdquo; Before you knew it there was a tap on your shoulder and you wipe your head around and see Peters face. He sensed the energy ball coming towards him and he quickly latched on the ceiling dodging the energy. You threw yourself at Peter.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Peter I&rsquo;m so so sorry, oh my god-&rdquo; Peter wrapped on arm around your waist and the other stroked your hair as you held him with your life.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine Y/N, I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo; You pulled away, you felt the tears prickling your eyes. <i>NO YOU CAN&rsquo;T LET GO YOU CAN&rsquo;T!</i>&nbsp;You looked at Peter, he noticed your glassy eyes. He brought one hand up to your cheek.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay Y/N&rdquo; he said softly, with a reassuring smile. And thats when you lost it, your body fell numb as your body collapsed, Peter wrapped his hand around your waist and fell to the ground with you. He hugged you on the ground as you let go. Your tears soaked up his shirt.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I-I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t, I-It hurts Peter. It hurts so bad.&rdquo; You sobbed, as all the feelings you kept locked up for the past five years came out. The tears ran down your face like a waterfall, it wouldn&rsquo;t stop. And you felt a weight being lifted off your shoulder. Peter stroked your back and just brought you closer to his body. &ldquo;P-peter, Im so sorry. I-I can&rsquo;t&rdquo; You soaked up in his shirt, grabbing everything he was giving you.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I-It&rsquo;s okay Y/N,&rdquo; He kissed the side of your head.&nbsp;You couldn&rsquo;t breathe, you pulled back trying to gasp for hair. Peters hand flys up to your face, stroking your cheek bones. He looks You in the eye and says &ldquo;Let it go,&rdquo; and thats exactly what you did. You yelled out in pain as Peter held you close. The rest of the team watched from afar, they held each other watching you cry on Peters shoulder. All there hearts breaking at the amount of pain you&rsquo;ve kept in, a 16 year old girl, there 16 year old girl should not be holding that much pain and that&rsquo;s when they finally realized everything you&rsquo;ve went through. Nat and Wanda were silently crying as the guys choked back there tears. Peter soon started to feel the tears running down his cheeks. He continued to hold you as you felt the world beating you down.&nbsp;</p><p>After what seemed like a hours, everyone had gone inside awhile ago giving you space. You were just breathing heavy, having felt like you had no more tears to let out. Your eyes were red and puffy. Your head rested on Peters shoulder, your body in a tight ball on Peters lap. You soon fell asleep on his shoulder. It was already night time, so Peter picks you up and makes his way to your room. He passes by the team, Steve was talking to Tony, when Tony&rsquo;s eye caught your torn down body in Peter&rsquo;s arms. Peter could tell Tony had been crying&hellip; and drinking for awhile. The team noticed your sleeping figure and didn&rsquo;t dare make a sound. Except for Tony, he made his way to Peter, he halted his stance, no letting go of you, afraid to wake you up. Tony stood in front of Peter, looking down at his daughter. He pushed a few strands of hair from your face, placing a kiss on your forehead, before stepping out of the way, nodding to Peter.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter carefully placed you on your bed, he tucked you under the blankets. Before he could walk away from the bed you grabbed his wrist. He looks down at you,&nbsp;&ldquo;Stay.&rdquo; you say weakly. Peter gives you a soft smile nodding his head. You slide over, making room for Peter. Peter pulls the blanket above both your bodies. You slide closer to him resting you head on his chest, taking in his scent. Peter wrapped his arm around your waist pulling you closer. You let out a sigh and fall into a deep sleep. Peter rubs small circles on your waist until he too falls asleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>A/N: I hope you guys liked Part 8, </p><p>Part 9 coming soon! </p></p>",

It smelled just like him, you couldn\u2019t get enough of it and it didn\u2019t help that you wanted to jump his bones every chance you got. You smiled to yourself as your favorite movie began to play on the giant TV in the common area. You had worked yourself ragged throughout the week and you were finally going to take the break you deserved watching sappy romance movies.</p><p>The movie played on as your favorite avenger sat down beside you, \u201cHey, (Y/n). What are we watching?\u201d Your body tensed, his voice like music to your ears, \u201cOh just Charlie St. Cloud.\u201d He cocked an eyebrow unaware of the movie, you faked exasperation, \u201cOh cmon! It\u2019s a sappy love story who doesn\u2019t love those?\u201d Steve laughed lightheartedly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to offend you but I\u2019ve never seen it.\u201d You smiled at him from ear to ear, \u201cGuess that means you\u2019re gonna watch it with me?\u201d You were hopeful that he\u2019d stay, you loved having him around. Steve smiles at you rubbing the back of his neck slightly, \u201cSure, I\u2019ll watch it. Only because you want me to.\u201d</p><p>The two of you were cuddled close to each other, to be honest you didn\u2019t even know how you both ended up the way you did, but you couldn\u2019t focus on the movie. Your were laying on his chest his and you could feel the rise and fall of his steady breathing. His scent was intoxicating and the knowledge of having his strong legs intertwined with your own brought dirty unspeakable thoughts to your head. You wanted so badly to be under him panting, no, screaming his name. You wanted to feel him pounding into you relentlessly until you came around his cock. Your cheeks were beginning to burn as you began to focus on the movie. </p><p>Suddenly you felt Steve tense underneath you. Your eyes grew wide as the sex scene you had completely forgotten about began to play out in front of your eyes. You felt something begin to harden against your inner thigh, Steve was getting hard, and you were laying on his lap. You felt need begin to pool between your legs, you squirmed slightly and Steve let out a moan. You shot your head to look at him. His face was beat red and he was looking anywhere but your face. An evil idea popped into your head. </p><p>You sat up so that both legs were on either side of his hips and you pretended to stretch. Steve looked up at you, slightly panicked. You were squirming on his dick and god it felt so good. His hands gripped your hips halting you and you looked down at him innocently, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter Cap?\u201d His voice was needy, \u201cDoll you gotta stop doing that.\u201d You smirked at him feigning innocence, \u201cWhy?\u201d </p><p>The look on Steve\u2019s face made you bite your lip, \u201cDoll do you think this is a game?\u201d You smirked rocking your hips against him moaning lightly. The friction on your clit made you whimper, his eyes grew dark biting his own lip as he watched you, \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking beautiful.\u201d His hips jutted up lightly to meet your movements, your bodies grinding against one another. You leaned down kissing him, slipping your tongue into his mouth as his hands trailed your body mapping every inch of you.</p><p> He took your bottom lip between his teeth pulling lightly, you gasped at the sensation. You felt yourself get closer your orgasm, \u201cSteve I can\u2019t hold out much longer.\u201d You were moaning, the sensation of his hard cock against your swollen clit was, his lips grazed against the sensitive skin near your ear, \u201cCum for me.\u201d You felt your body shake as your high took over, you continued rocking your hips bringing yourself down from your high as you saw Steve throw his head back with a soft grunt.</p><p>You looked at him and let out a chuckle, feeling slightly embarrassed. Steve smiles at you his face red, you broke the silence, \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to do that for so long.\u201d You blushed looking down at him, \u201cI\u2019ve liked you for a while.\u201d He grinned up at you, \u201cI\u2019ve liked you for a while too.\u201d You lightly kissed his lips smiling into it. Suddenly Steve sat up, pulling away, \u201cWe can have this talk in a couple minutes I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d He stood up walking toward the elevator, you looked at him confused, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He looked at you, his cheeks a deep crimson, \u201cI ugh, need to change my pants.\u201d </p><p>Tags:</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMauQ5okS7eo-NL_w5uNsLw\">@thebuckboibarnes</a> </p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5QBjEbO5niGUOoQ31qyjKA\">@m-a-t-91</a> </p>",

It smelled just like him, you couldn\u2019t get enough of it and it didn\u2019t help that you wanted to jump his bones every chance you got. You smiled to yourself as your favorite movie began to play on the giant TV in the common area. You had worked yourself ragged throughout the week and you were finally going to take the break you deserved watching sappy romance movies.</p><p>The movie played on as your favorite avenger sat down beside you, \u201cHey, (Y/n). What are we watching?\u201d Your body tensed, his voice like music to your ears, \u201cOh just Charlie St. Cloud.\u201d He cocked an eyebrow unaware of the movie, you faked exasperation, \u201cOh cmon! It\u2019s a sappy love story who doesn\u2019t love those?\u201d Steve laughed lightheartedly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to offend you but I\u2019ve never seen it.\u201d You smiled at him from ear to ear, \u201cGuess that means you\u2019re gonna watch it with me?\u201d You were hopeful that he\u2019d stay, you loved having him around. Steve smiles at you rubbing the back of his neck slightly, \u201cSure, I\u2019ll watch it. Only because you want me to.\u201d</p><p>The two of you were cuddled close to each other, to be honest you didn\u2019t even know how you both ended up the way you did, but you couldn\u2019t focus on the movie. Your were laying on his chest his and you could feel the rise and fall of his steady breathing. His scent was intoxicating and the knowledge of having his strong legs intertwined with your own brought dirty unspeakable thoughts to your head. You wanted so badly to be under him panting, no, screaming his name. You wanted to feel him pounding into you relentlessly until you came around his cock. Your cheeks were beginning to burn as you began to focus on the movie. </p><p>Suddenly you felt Steve tense underneath you. Your eyes grew wide as the sex scene you had completely forgotten about began to play out in front of your eyes. You felt something begin to harden against your inner thigh, Steve was getting hard, and you were laying on his lap. You felt need begin to pool between your legs, you squirmed slightly and Steve let out a moan. You shot your head to look at him. His face was beat red and he was looking anywhere but your face. An evil idea popped into your head. </p><p>You sat up so that both legs were on either side of his hips and you pretended to stretch. Steve looked up at you, slightly panicked. You were squirming on his dick and god it felt so good. His hands gripped your hips halting you and you looked down at him innocently, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter Cap?\u201d His voice was needy, \u201cDoll you gotta stop doing that.\u201d You smirked at him feigning innocence, \u201cWhy?\u201d </p><p>The look on Steve\u2019s face made you bite your lip, \u201cDoll do you think this is a game?\u201d You smirked rocking your hips against him moaning lightly. The friction on your clit made you whimper, his eyes grew dark biting his own lip as he watched you, \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking beautiful.\u201d His hips jutted up lightly to meet your movements, your bodies grinding against one another. You leaned down kissing him, slipping your tongue into his mouth as his hands trailed your body mapping every inch of you.</p><p> He took your bottom lip between his teeth pulling lightly, you gasped at the sensation. You felt yourself get closer your orgasm, \u201cSteve I can\u2019t hold out much longer.\u201d You were moaning, the sensation of his hard cock against your swollen clit was, his lips grazed against the sensitive skin near your ear, \u201cCum for me.\u201d You felt your body shake as your high took over, you continued rocking your hips bringing yourself down from your high as you saw Steve throw his head back with a soft grunt.</p><p>You looked at him and let out a chuckle, feeling slightly embarrassed. Steve smiles at you his face red, you broke the silence, \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to do that for so long.\u201d You blushed looking down at him, \u201cI\u2019ve liked you for a while.\u201d He grinned up at you, \u201cI\u2019ve liked you for a while too.\u201d You lightly kissed his lips smiling into it. Suddenly Steve sat up, pulling away, \u201cWe can have this talk in a couple minutes I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d He stood up walking toward the elevator, you looked at him confused, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He looked at you, his cheeks a deep crimson, \u201cI ugh, need to change my pants.\u201d </p><p>Tags:</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMauQ5okS7eo-NL_w5uNsLw\">@thebuckboibarnes</a> </p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5QBjEbO5niGUOoQ31qyjKA\">@m-a-t-91</a> </p></p>",
