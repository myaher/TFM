        "body": "<p>You ever completely panic and let your body do whatever it thinks it\u2019s supposed to do? Sometimes we shit ourselves, other times we freeze. Hunters, we tend to get violent. </p>\n\n<p>My hand shot out and impaled the closest demon, someone\u2019s aging soccer mom. It gave a howl in pain as I ripped out the blade. I turned to face another and ducked under a flying fist. Slit his belly open and watched his guts spill just like Steve\u2019s. Whipped my leg around and kicked him in the temple. </p>\n\n<p>This was a nightmare. I\u2019d never faced more than one demon at a time and now there were <em>ten</em>. I dodged, stabbed, kicked, and made absolutely no impact on their numbers. Even the one I\u2019d disemboweled was getting back to his feet. </p>\n\n<p>One managed to clip me on the head with what felt like a bat. In the few seconds I was dazed another demon locked my arms behind my back. The guy that had hit me got in close, grabbed my chin, and leered. \u201cI wonder what it\u2019s like to fuck a hunter.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>On the surface, what with the claws and fangs and black eyes, monsters seem inhuman, but get down into the basics and they\u2019ve got the same wants and desires as the rest of us. The difference often was whether their natural hunger had been slaked, be it for flesh, brains, or violence. This wasn\u2019t the first time I\u2019d encountered a sociopathic creature aiming to fulfill more base desires and it wouldn\u2019t be the last. </p>\n\n<p>Demon or not, males are still males. \u201cNot interested,\u201d I replied as my knee snapped up between the bastard\u2019s legs. He folded down. I whipped my head back at the one behind me while he was gaping. Soon as my arms were freed I introduced my fist to his face. </p>\n\n<p>Tim and Reggie made a break for the camper and I followed. We climbed into the late Steve\u2019s ride and slammed the doors shut. I watched the demons gather themselves as Tim dropped the keys from the visor and started the engine. The black eyed fuckers smiled as we peeled out of the parking lot. </p>\n\n<p>I sat down on the aisle between the stove and the table in order to catch my breath. All of us were scraped up, bruised, and bloody. From the passenger\u2019s seat, Reggie attempted to console his friend. \u201cTim\u2014\u201c</p>\n\n<p>\u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d the other man snapped. </p>\n\n<p>We drove in silence for several miles, just far enough to feel safe, before Tim pulled to the side of the road. As soon as we were stopped, he began slamming his palms against the steering wheel. \u201cFUCK! FUCK! FUCK!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019re we gonna do?\u201d asked Reggie. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI got me an idea.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTake me back to my bike,\u201d I said as I stood up. I leaned over between the two seats so I could make sure they heard me. \u201cTen demons? Whatever stupid-ass idea you\u2019ve got is suicide.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOkay. But first\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Tim\u2019s fist connected solidly with my temple. Blackout. </p>\n\n<p>Next thing I knew I was being hauled down the camper steps in a fireman\u2019s carry, across black pavement, and through some doorway, its bell blasting in my ears. Through the haze, as I was dropped to my feet, I heard someone cry my name. A moment later a blade was pressed against my throat. That cleared the fog up pretty goddam quick. \u201cThe fuck\u2014?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cJust take it easy, okay?\u201d came Sam Winchester\u2019s voice. \u201cPut the knife down.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Reggie wasn\u2019t stupid enough to do that, especially since he knew that once he did I\u2018d grab it and shove it in his throat. In fact, the knife bit a little more. I felt a small trickle of blood go down my neck. </p>\n\n<p>Now I didn\u2019t know Sam from Adam at the time. He might not care that some woman he\u2019d met for all of five minutes was being used as leverage for whatever the Douchebag Trio, sorry, Duo had in mind. Maybe he\u2019d just fight them off and leave me to my fate. Fortunately for me, the man has a hero complex, a trait that gets him in trouble more often than he would like to admit. \u201cStop!\u201d Sam cried. \u201cIt\u2019s true. What the demons said, it\u2019s all true.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cKeep going,\u201d Tim said, deceptively calm. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhy? You going to hate me any less? Am I going to hate myself any less? What do you want?\u201d Such a whiner. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI want to hear you say it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>There was a moment of quiet. \u201cI did it. I started the Apocalypse.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Oh. Well then. Of course, the details were more convoluted than could be explained in a single sentence, but at the time I was just angry that this over-grown idiot had doomed us all. But before I could express my outrage I was handcuffed to the service station. It was a sign of just how out of it I was that I hadn\u2019t noticed the bracelets sooner. </p>\n\n<p>I pulled at the cuffs, loudly clanging metal against metal, as Tim withdrew a vial of red liquid from his pocket. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d a deeply apprehensive Sam asked. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat do you think it is?\u201d Tim replied triumphantly. \u201cIt\u2019s go juice, Sammy boy.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Demon blood, had to be. The mix of desire and loathing on Sam\u2019s face was ugly. \u201cGet that away from me,\u201d he growled. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cAway from you?\u201d asked Tim. \u201cNo. This is <em>for</em> you. Hell, if that demon wasn\u2019t right as rain. Down the hatch, son.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAre you <em>insane</em>?\u201d I yelled. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what that\u2019s going to do to him! For all we know it\u2019s going to make him kill <em>us</em>, you stupid son of a bitch!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWill you shut that slut up?\u201d Tim barked at his co-conspirator. </p>\n\n<p>Reggie backhanded me. I\u2019m quite sure he\u2019d been wanting to do that ever since I\u2019d dumped his ass. After spitting blood from a bitten cheek onto the floor, I looked up through stray locks of hair and told the motherfucker, \u201cWhen I get out of these you\u2019ll have to eat through a <em>straw</em>.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLook, just leave her alone,\u201d Sam said loudly, \u201cand we can work this out.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Tim ignored him. \u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s gonna happen. You\u2019re gonna drink this, Hulk out, and you\u2019re gonna waste every one of the demon scum that killed my best friend.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Confident I was secured, Reggie joined his friend in advancing on the taller hunter. Tim held out the vial invitingly. \u201cCome on,\u201d he urged, \u201cyou know you want it, Sam. Just reach it and take it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Entranced by the proffered liquid, Sam failed to notice Reggie creeping up to him from the left. In another moment they were grappling and Tim moved forward to force the blood down the Winchester boy\u2019s mouth. </p>\n\n<p>Great, Dumb and Dumber were distracted. I yanked on the cuffs again. No go. Next, I looked about (out of the corner of my eye I could see Sam spitting crimson liquid into Tim\u2019s face). Bottled, cups, and toothpicks. Nothing remotely helpful. </p>\n\n<p>My lockpicks were in my boot. I swung my foot up and used my teeth to undo the laces. Thank you, mom, for insisting I keep up with the gymnastics. As I worked I could hear fists smacking flesh. I wasn\u2019t quite sure who I was rooting for at this point. I just hoped they were too preoccupied to see what I was doing\u2026 and\u2026 success! I pounded my loosened heel on the countertop to drop the kit near my hands. A few seconds later I was free. </p>\n\n<p>When I looked up I saw Sam beating the ever living hell out of Tim. Good\u2026 except Reggie was sneaking up behind him with that stupid knife. I grabbed the nearest mug and hurled it as hard as I could. It hit him right in the face. Even better, his blade dropped to the floor and Sam snatched it up. He held it to Tim\u2019s neck while Reggie spit out a few teeth. </p>\n\n<p>The Winchester boy then looked at <em>me</em>. I don\u2019t know what was on my face, but it made his expression crumple from fury to resignation. He shoved Tim at Reggie. \u201cGo.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Tim rubbed his own neck. \u201cDon\u2019t think we won\u2019t be back.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t think I won\u2019t be here.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The Douchebag Duo left and left me alone with Sam. He approached and reached out at the bruise on my face. \u201cAre you\u2014\u201c</p>\n\n<p>I slapped the hand away. \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d Touching me without permission was a good way to develop a fatal case of steel-in-the-gut. </p>\n\n<p>Sam backed away. \u201cSorry. Let me at least get you some ice.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I didn\u2019t object; my cheek was throbbing. Sam was lifting the gate to get behind the bar when I heard the engine of Steve\u2019s van rev several times. There was no way that thing would survive being rammed into the bar wall so I couldn\u2019t begin to fathom what he was planning. Didn\u2019t have to wait long; a few seconds later a horrible series of crunching and grating noises filtered in. </p>\n\n<p>My blood ran cold. They <em>couldn\u2019t</em> have. \u201cOh, shit,\u201d I gasped and ran through the exit. </p>\n\n<p>Yep. Those dickheads had run over my motorcycle. My poor bike was smashed all to hell, parts strewn in a curve all over the parking lot. Luckily the saddlebag that had ended up scraping along the concrete was the one with my personal effects and <em>not</em> the one with my weaponry. They\u2019d even done the courtesy of tossing my sword and its sheathe out of the camper. Both were lying sadly on the asphalt several feet away. </p>\n\n<p>Sam came out holding a clean rag full of ice as I was silently fuming. The idiot made the mistake of putting a hand on my shoulder while my back was turned and I automatically spun around to plant a fist in his stomach. He let out a <em>whoof</em> and stumbled back a few paces. \u201cOops,\u201d I said. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOw!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I didn\u2019t apologize; he should have known better. Instead I knelt down and got busy unclipping my surviving saddlebag from the wreck that had been my Yamaha. The other one was completely shredded. I pulled it out from under the ruined bike anyways to see if anything had survived. Nope. I discovered my spare clothing had been inadvertently reconstituted as workshop rags with the exception of a single pair of underwear. In an additional insult to injury my toiletries had squelched out and had soaked pretty much everything. </p>\n\n<p>Wonderful. My current shirt and jeans were filthy with blood and sweat and I was in the middle of Nowhere, Oklahoma without a ride. I sat down with my rescued panties hanging pathetically from my fingers and sighed. \u201cGreat. Just fucking great.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cListen,\u201d Sam said as he put the ice pack on my cheek. I flinched, but gratefully held the cold thing to my face. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you at least spend the night at my place? In the morning I can take you wherever you want to go.\u201d I peered up at him suspiciously. \u201cJust a peace offering,\u201d he claimed. </p>\n\n<p>Seeing that there was a dearth of options I told him, \u201cFine.\u201d I stood and walked over to my sword with a scrap of what had been a really comfortable shirt. As I headed back I wiped off the dirt and blood. \u201cNo funny business,\u201d I warned him as I pointed the tip at his chest. </p>\n\n<p>Sam eyed it warily. \u201cYou got it.\u201d</p>\n\n<hr><p>As the shower warmed up I took stock of my remaining belongings. Bow (no arrows; all snapped), sword, wallet, iPhone, compass. Rollup pouch of various blades. Couple of tampons (which, then and now, made Sam deeply uncomfortable), makeup bag that was miraculously untouched, and the (lonely) underwear. </p>\n\n<p>Sam put a shirt, flannel, and a pair of basketball shorts next to my bag. \u201cJust for now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll throw what you\u2019re wearing in the wash.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I grabbed what I needed and headed into the now delightfully steamy bathroom. </p>\n\n<p>After passing my clothing out to Sam I used his soap and shampoo. No wonder the man had such a fluffy coif; the stuff he used was really nice. Now clean, my long, black hair wrapped snugly in a towel, I catalogued bruises and cuts. Nothing major. Worst was the mark on the side of my face, the one out there by a <em>human</em> dickwad. </p>\n\n<p>I unfolded Sam\u2019s shirt and snorted. The thing was a tent. I don\u2019t know what he was thinking; he had almost a foot in height on me. Better than nothing. It was comfy and warm and with the flannel everything would be covered. There was no fitting the shorts, however, no matter how tight I made the drawstring. Oh well. </p>\n\n<p>Sam returned while I was packing up the remains of my meager possessions. He still had my clothes in his hands. \u201cSomeone\u2019s using the washer. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll get to it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I looked around the motel room. There was only one, albeit king-sized, bed and no couch.</p>\n\n<p>He saw what I was doing and declared, \u201cI\u2019ll take the floor.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cThat bed is huge, dumbass. You stay on your side and I\u2019ll stay on mine.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAre you sure? Because\u2014\u201c</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLook, you\u2019re cute, and normally I\u2019d be seeing if you were interested in a good fuck.\u201d Sam flushed. Aw, how precious. Wish I could still picture him that way; what happened between us several months later pretty much scrapped any concepts I had about his innocence. \u201cBut I just got knocked in the head several times, not to mention nearly torn to pieces by a bunch of black-eyed assholes. I want to sleep <em>comfortably</em>. And after those guys knocked <em>you</em> around? I bet you do too.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSomeone also punched me in the stomach,\u201d he said wryly. </p>\n\n<p>I made a disparaging noise before lifting a corner of the covers and climbing into bed. \u201cGood night, Sam.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah. Good night, Eva.\u201d</p>\n\n<hr><p>I was woken up a few hours later when Sam\u2019s lips found my neck. My eyes snapped open and I flipped around. Initially, I was prepared to smack him, but he was staring at me with such affection that I was taken aback. \u201cI love you, Jess,\u201d he murmured. </p>\n\n<p>God, if only I\u2019d known then what this little hallucination of his was heralding I\u2019d have walked out that damn door the second I woke up. I merely thought Sam Winchester was in the grips of some really intense dream. It was either that or I\u2019d taken charity from a delirious nutcase. </p>\n\n<p>Nonplussed, I watched as he turned around and sat at the edge of the bed. \u201cGod knows how much I miss you, too,\u201d Sam said sadly. \u201cBut you\u2019re wrong. People <em>can</em> change. There <em>is</em> reason for hope.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat a crock of shit,\u201d I replied bitterly.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d he asked.</p>\n\n<p>I hesitated. I mean, undoubtedly he was talking to Harvey the Rabbit, but I barely knew the man. It wasn\u2019t really the right time and place to expound on the fallacies of the human race. It was taken out of my hands, however, when Sam jerked around and looked at me in horror. My eyebrows shot up as he stood up and stumbled backwards. \u201c<em>Lucifer</em>.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A chill ran down my spine. I\u2019m in no way religious, especially after everything I\u2019ve seen and been through, but my parents had been devout Christians. I also didn\u2019t have my head in the sand; I knew the Apocalypse that was looming was the <em>biblical</em> Apocalypse, atheists be damned. Sam Winchester had claimed he was responsible. Maybe the guilt had addled his brain. \u201cWhat do you want with me?\u201d he demanded. \u201cI don\u2019t want <em>anything</em> from you.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I glanced around and found my saddlebags set neatly at a table near the window at the opposite side of the room. Damnit, I wanted a knife, but I didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d react if I moved. When I turned back, Sam\u2019s expression had gone from horrified to baffled. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d he asked. </p>\n\n<p>Sam stood and took a few steps back, his gaze pointed at some vague spot on the wall. I guess Satan had gotten to his feet. \u201cNo,\u201d he snarled. \u201cNo. That\u2019ll <em>never</em> happen.\u201d A short pause. \u201cYou need my consent.\u201d And another. \u201cI will <em>kill myself</em> before letting you in.\u201d I really wished I could hear the other half of this bizarre conversation. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d More silence. \u201cWhy me?\u201d His head fell. </p>\n\n<p>When Sam finally raised his head it was to search about as if whomever (or whatever) he\u2019d been talking to had vanished. Much to my consternation those hazel orbs were filled with tears. \u201cSam?\u201d I ventured.</p>\n\n<p>He jumped. \u201cE-Eva?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I went for directness. \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cUh, um, nothing.\u201d Sam turned away. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cSam,\u201d I snapped. He still didn\u2019t look at me. \u201cYou woke me up by <em>kissing me</em>. Then you called me <em>Lucifer</em>.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>That got his attention. He whirled back around. \u201cHow much did you hear?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cEverything <em>you</em> said. So again: what the hell is going on?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>All right, enough of Mystery Man and his enigmatic phantasms. \u201cFuck this, I\u2019m out.\u201d I stood up and whipped off the borrowed flannel. But when I pulled the shirt over my head, fully intending on throwing both things back at their owner, getting dressed, and hitching a ride, his shocked gasp was hard to miss. It wasn\u2019t my sudden nudity; I\u2019d bet Sam Winchester had been treated to much better sights. I\u2019d been so rudely awakened and treated to such a queer spectacle that I\u2019d forgotten I was in his bed as a guest and not a lover, and it meant that I hadn\u2019t warned him about my scars. </p>\n\n<p>They crisscross my back in an irregular pattern. I remember how each of them had been inflicted. This one, here, across my shoulder blades, was from a bullwhip. That one, right under my ribs,\nwas one of a dozen made by a razors he\u2019d kept in a velvet-lined case, blades too small to kill but just right for inflicting pain. The one closest to my nape? His teeth. </p>\n\n<p>After Bobby rescued me, it took months of rehabilitation to get me back on my feet, but once they were healed I\u2019d traveled to Japan. With Bobby\u2019s directions (the man is, quite surprisingly, fluent in Japanese) I\u2019d found a tattoo artist who was also familiar with the supernatural. After two exquisitely torturous days under the needle I had an <em>irezumi</em>, a traditional Japanese tattoo, of a sinuous black dragon curled over my back and buttocks. An anti-possession mark was hidden in its coils along with thirteen Shinto wards meant to ward off evil. It covered nearly all my scars, but in certain lights you could make out every ridge and gouge. </p>\n\n<p>Sam obviously knew he wasn\u2019t looking at the expected inevitable repercussions of living as a hunter. Those would have been scattered, maybe a few on my arms, my legs, my torso. <em>These</em> were concentrated on my back. They\u2019d been artistically inflicted by a sadist, one with centuries of experience. Of course, there was no way he could have known <em>then</em> who and why but his silence spoke volumes. </p>\n\n<p>I slowly put the flannel back over my shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m not telling you,\u201d I said quietly, still not facing the man, \u201cso don\u2019t ask.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d he said gently. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>It was refreshing, and jarring, to meet someone who didn\u2019t pry. Some men wanted salacious details, thinking it might be from a background of rough S&amp;M. Others played the macho card and wanted to know who and whether or not the perpetrator had been punished. Both disgusted me, which is why I normally told some outrageous lie (sorority hazing, Halloween makeup gone wrong, a really aggressive dog), then rode \u2018em and tossed \u2018em in the same night. </p>\n\n<p>Whether Sam would backtrack to appease his curiosity wasn\u2019t a given. Then again, after what I\u2019d seen I was certain he had his own secrets that he didn\u2019t want unearthed. I buttoned up and made a quick decision. \u201cLook. I need a ride to Bobby Singer\u2019s. He obviously knows you so I\u2019m assuming you know him. He hooked me up with my last bike for dirt cheap and I\u2019m pretty damn sure he\u2018ll do it again. If you\u2019re not going to help me then I need to get moving.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll take you.\u201d He wiped a hand down his face. \u201cI was planning on leaving town anyhow.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIs this\u2026 talking to Lucifer thing a nightly occurrence? Should I be prepared?\u201d I had to ask. </p>\n\n<p>Sam chuckled a little, much to my surprise. \u201cNo. I\u2019m pretty sure this was a one time thing.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFantastic. Can I get back to sleep now?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOh. Yeah, yeah, no problem.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I tucked myself back into bed. Sam, however, grabbed his jacket. \u201cWhere you going?\u201d I asked sleepily. </p>\n\n<p>He gave me a small, sad smile. It made me want to cuddle him. I swear he must practice those puppy eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll be back. Just going for a walk.\u201d I made an agreeable noise as he shut the door. </p>\n\n<p>Man, I\u2019d lucked out. Nearly killed by demons, knocked senseless by a complete asshole, and had my ride and belongings completely fucked over. But surprise, surprise! I scored a free ticket to Bobby\u2019s and a handsome companion to get me there. Afterwards, Sam could go his way, I could go mine. No way I wanted to get into whatever issues the Winchester boy was having, <em>especially</em> since he seemed to be directly involved with the Apocalypse. </p>\n\n<p>I wish time travel was more accessible. Stupid, naive past-me really needed a whack upside the head. </p>\n\n<hr><p>We left as early as possible the next day. Sam paid the reckoning for our room and we loaded up his car, a rust yellow Lincoln Continental with ripped seats and a faint smell of cigarettes. I sat in the passenger\u2019s side and popped open the dash. \u201cGeorge Freedman,\u201d I read off the registration. </p>\n\n<p>Sam turned the engine over. \u201cYou really wanna know?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I tossed the slip of paper over my shoulder. \u201cNope.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>It was going to take us about a day to get to Sioux Falls (barring traffic) including some overnight driving. I offered to take the middle stretch and he agreed. </p>\n\n<p>Both of us, by unspoken mutual agreement, made no small talk. We were both content to be lost in our own thoughts, the shifting radio serving as a backdrop. It started on a modern pop station, but somewhere between states it morphed into classic rock. I caught Sam mouthing the words for a few minutes before he grimaced and tuned it to country. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo love for Zepplin?\u201d I asked. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cNah.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>We did a drive thru for lunch but decided to stop at a sit-down place for dinner, some out of the way diner in Missouri. I ordered a Cobb and a water, he did the same. While we waited I hummed a little, not seeing the need to start a conversation. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty tune,\u201d Sam said, killing my attempt to keep myself distant. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cPiece,\u201d I corrected. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOkay, \u2018piece\u2019. What is it?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cChopin\u2019s Prelude in E minor.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou play the piano?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPlayed.\u201d It wasn\u2019t as if I could cart an upright around while I hunted. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cAh.\u201d I resumed humming. Sam, unfortunately, didn\u2019t seem to like awkward silences. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSure.\u201d He could ask, but it wasn\u2019t like I was obligated to answer. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat made you start hunting?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I shrugged. \u201cThing killed my family. Went looking for it. The end.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 vague.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>No shit, Sherlock. I figured Sam was used to people opening up to him almost right away. He flashes those empathetic eyes at them and they cave. Not me. \u201cSo why are <em>you</em> a hunter?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPretty much the same reason.\u201d Our salads arrived and we dug in. \u201cHow long ago?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I lifted an eyebrow. \u201cDoes that matter?\u201d I asked before popping a cherry tomato in my mouth. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI guess not. It\u2019s just\u2026 you seem pretty skilled. No one gets that good right away.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been\u2026 several years. You?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAlmost all my life.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Wait. \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018almost\u2019? Not including the obvious time you were in diapers.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sam poked morosely at some lettuce. \u201cI, um\u2026 I went to college for a bit.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cStanford.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I gave a derisive snort. \u201c<em>Stanford</em>.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He lifted his eyebrows. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be the first person I\u2019ve told that isn\u2019t amazed I went there.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>No lack of ego there. \u201cThat\u2019s because I went to Berkeley.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sam startled me with a bark of genuinely surprised laughter. The rivalry between our two universities was notorious. \u201cYou sure you won\u2019t stab me in my sleep?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBears are <em>inherently</em> better than trees, chump,\u201d I declared, referring to our respective mascots. </p>\n\n<p>Sam continued chuckling as he ate. I speared a slice of hard boiled egg and tried to choke it down. Remembering college inevitably recalled the phone call I\u2019d gotten from the SFPD that cloudy Thursday afternoon, taking the BART into the city while numb with shock, seeing the blood liberally splattered over the walls of the place that had once been my childhood home\u2026</p>\n\n<p>I gave up trying to eat and put my fork aside. After a minute or so Sam did the same. It looked like the path of our conversation had killed both our appetites. I wondered if he\u2019d left Stanford for the same reason I\u2019d left Berkeley. However, I didn\u2019t want to pry and only ruminated about how much tuition money Sam had thrown down the drain. </p>\n\n<p>We choked down a few more bites before asking for the check and getting back on the road. Sam had driven until lunch, I\u2019d been driving since then. We switched about three hours in and I curled up in the back to get some sleep. </p>\n\n<p>Sam woke me up <em>again</em>. I figured if I ever wanted to get a full night\u2019s sleep again it had to be without him anywhere in the vicinity. At least this time there was no unintentional molestation; now he was just talking on the phone. I got the impression that he might have begun the conversation quietly for my sake, but the topic was distracting (not to mention agonizing) enough that courtesy had been forgotten. \u201dHe said <em>I\u2019m</em> the one that\u2019s supposed to be letting him ride around in my skin.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>At least this time I could hear the other person. \u201cSo, you\u2019re his vessel, huh?\u201d they said. Damn, that was one deep voice. I pictured someone taller than Sam with the build of a lumberjack. Beard, belly, plaid, the works. \u201cLucifer\u2019s wearing you to the prom?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he said.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Well, shit. I\u2019d heard about the whole angelic possession thing. A hunter who wanted to survive kept up with new supernatural developments. We all knew that angels were walking the Earth for the first time in thousands of years. They were supposedly powerful, invulnerable, and could freaking <em>teleport</em>. Rumor mill also had it that while demons took unwilling meatsuits, Heaven\u2019s ambassadors needed permission before getting a ride. Therefore Lucifer, who, if I remember correctly, was an archangel, needed <em>Sam\u2019s</em> permission to ride his ass through Armageddon. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2018d fooled myself into thinking that maybe he\u2019d been playing along in order to get the Douchebag Trio\u2014sorry, Duo\u2014off our backs and that maybe last night\u2019s conversation had been the product of some personal issues he was having. Apparently I was an idiot. I\u2019d been watching Lucifer court his fucking vessel and hadn\u2019t had the foresight to do something about it. Well, it looked like I\u2019d been given a second chance. </p>\n\n<p>Quietly and slowly I reached down and unsheathed my sword. \u201cDean, don\u2019t do this,\u201d Sam was pleading. A farewell sounded from the other end and he slowly dropped his phone. </p>\n\n<p>I didn\u2019t want to startle him <em>too</em> much; he was driving, after all, and I didn\u2019t want to end up splattered on the side of the road. Instead, I slid my weapon over Sam\u2019s neck with just enough slowdown so he could acknowledge what was happening. \u201cPull over,\u201d I said softly. </p>\n\n<p>The car drifted to the embankment. \u201cEva\u2014\u201c</p>\n\n<p>\u201cShut the fuck up. If I slit your throat would it all be done?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I felt Sam\u2019s throat bob my blade up and down. \u201cLucifer told me he\u2019d just bring me back.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>It was very likely he telling the truth. There was too much despair in his voice for it to be a ruse. \u201cAnd the other guy?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMy brother.\u201c</p>\n\n<p>If there was anything I could empathize with it was sibling estrangement. Still, I might be able to save a lot of lives by killing him. Or maybe he\u2019d just get resurrected and my altruism would bring the literal wrath of Hell down on my head. Just\u2026 there was a chance I could derail the Apocalypse right here, right now. Or I might doom myself into having a revengeful lumberjack on my ass for the rest of my life. </p>\n\n<p>I vacillated between the two possibilities for a bit too long. With a speed belied by his size Sam\u2018s left arm shot over to grasp the back of my shirt. He yanked me into the front seat and I let out a really undignified squeal. I threw my arms up to prevent my head from slamming into the dash as my blade flew to his feet. </p>\n\n<p>After struggling a bit in the small space I ended up in a one-armed chokehold with my boot heels pressed against the passenger side window. Sam\u2019s left arm was wrapped around my body for additional restraint. Frustrated, I kicked the door and the glass several times before letting myself go slack. \u201cYou done?\u201d Sam asked irritably. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d Even to <em>myself</em> I sounded like a big, pouty baby. </p>\n\n<p>He let me go and moved his tree trunk of a leg so I couldn\u2019t retrieve my sword. \u201cCan we get going now?\u201d </p>\n\n<p>I answered him by slapping him silly. \u201cThat\u2019s for starting the Apocalypse.\u201d I slapped him again. \u201cAnd <em>that\u2019s</em> for Lucifer.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sam palmed his cheek, his eyes wide with outrage. \u201cHe\u2019s not in me right now!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said calmly as I settled down in my seat. \u201cJust make sure he gets it.\u201d After buckling my seatbelt I asked, as sweetly as possible, \u201cCan I have my sword back?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sam grimaced. He used his heel to slide my <em>samjeongdo</em> under his seat. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAsshole.\u201d</p>\n\n<hr><p>When I woke up again it was just after dawn. Sam\u2019s jacket was draped over my shoulders. Nice of him; it wasn\u2019t exactly warm this time of year. Then I saw that we were stopped under a bridge and was pissed; if we were still driving in the right direction and at the same speed we <em>should</em> have been in Sioux Falls. <em>This</em> was definitely <em>not</em> Singer Salvage Yard and that guy that Sam was talking to was <em>not</em> Bobby Singer.</p>\n\n<p>The stranger was slightly shorter than Sam (which still gave him half a foot over me) with a military cut and what were astonishingly handsome features. Man had a chiseled jawline and everything, and the five o\u2019clock shadow only enhanced the package. The way Sam was looking at him, with a mixture of hopefulness and guilt, cemented the fact that this male model wannabe was his brother, Dean. No beard and belly. At least I\u2019d gotten the plaid right. </p>\n\n<p>I watched Dean hand Sam some kind of knife. The former gave the latter what looked like an ultimatum. They came to an agreement, Sam started looking relieved and grateful, and the conversation was over. Time to meet the pretty boy.</p>\n\n<p>I opened the car door and got both of their attentions immediately. I will never forget how Dean\u2019s face went ashen at the sight of me. This was the first time we\u2019d met; there was no reason for him to be looking at me like I was some kind of ghost. </p>\n\n<p>I walked over and stopped near Sam, still meeting Dean\u2019s horrified expression with my own perturbed one. Stupid genetics. These two made me feel like a midget. \u201cWhat?\u201d I snapped. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou,\u201d Dean said breathlessly. \u201cI <em>saw</em> you.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cStalker much?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Sam asked his brother. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cFuture me, man,\u201d Dean said breathlessly. \u201cI caught him lookin\u2019 at this picture of us\u2026 them\u2026 whatever! Kept it in his pocket like some kind of fricking treasure.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sam was as confused as I was, but apparently it was for a different reason. Instead of, \u201cAre you crazy or something?\u201d (which I felt any normal person would have asked) he simply wondered, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBecause he said she was someone he\u2019d loved. And at some point\u2026\u201d Dean swallowed apprehensively and looked over at me. His next words would forever leave a black stain our relationship. \u201cAt some point <em>she died in his arms</em>.\u201d </p>\n\n<hr><p><strong>Acknowledgement</strong> : Some lines of dialogue are taken directly from the episodes \u201cFree to Be You and Me\u201d (SPN 5.03) and \u201cThe End\u201d (SPN 5.04). </p>",

            "comment": "<p>You ever completely panic and let your body do whatever it thinks it\u2019s supposed to do? Sometimes we shit ourselves, other times we freeze. Hunters, we tend to get violent. </p>\n\n<p>My hand shot out and impaled the closest demon, someone\u2019s aging soccer mom. It gave a howl in pain as I ripped out the blade. I turned to face another and ducked under a flying fist. Slit his belly open and watched his guts spill just like Steve\u2019s. Whipped my leg around and kicked him in the temple. </p>\n\n<p>This was a nightmare. I\u2019d never faced more than one demon at a time and now there were <em>ten</em>. I dodged, stabbed, kicked, and made absolutely no impact on their numbers. Even the one I\u2019d disemboweled was getting back to his feet. </p>\n\n<p>One managed to clip me on the head with what felt like a bat. In the few seconds I was dazed another demon locked my arms behind my back. The guy that had hit me got in close, grabbed my chin, and leered. \u201cI wonder what it\u2019s like to fuck a hunter.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>On the surface, what with the claws and fangs and black eyes, monsters seem inhuman, but get down into the basics and they\u2019ve got the same wants and desires as the rest of us. The difference often was whether their natural hunger had been slaked, be it for flesh, brains, or violence. This wasn\u2019t the first time I\u2019d encountered a sociopathic creature aiming to fulfill more base desires and it wouldn\u2019t be the last. </p>\n\n<p>Demon or not, males are still males. \u201cNot interested,\u201d I replied as my knee snapped up between the bastard\u2019s legs. He folded down. I whipped my head back at the one behind me while he was gaping. Soon as my arms were freed I introduced my fist to his face. </p>\n\n<p>Tim and Reggie made a break for the camper and I followed. We climbed into the late Steve\u2019s ride and slammed the doors shut. I watched the demons gather themselves as Tim dropped the keys from the visor and started the engine. The black eyed fuckers smiled as we peeled out of the parking lot. </p>\n\n<p>I sat down on the aisle between the stove and the table in order to catch my breath. All of us were scraped up, bruised, and bloody. From the passenger\u2019s seat, Reggie attempted to console his friend. \u201cTim\u2014\u201c</p>\n\n<p>\u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d the other man snapped. </p>\n\n<p>We drove in silence for several miles, just far enough to feel safe, before Tim pulled to the side of the road. As soon as we were stopped, he began slamming his palms against the steering wheel. \u201cFUCK! FUCK! FUCK!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019re we gonna do?\u201d asked Reggie. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI got me an idea.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTake me back to my bike,\u201d I said as I stood up. I leaned over between the two seats so I could make sure they heard me. \u201cTen demons? Whatever stupid-ass idea you\u2019ve got is suicide.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOkay. But first\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Tim\u2019s fist connected solidly with my temple. Blackout. </p>\n\n<p>Next thing I knew I was being hauled down the camper steps in a fireman\u2019s carry, across black pavement, and through some doorway, its bell blasting in my ears. Through the haze, as I was dropped to my feet, I heard someone cry my name. A moment later a blade was pressed against my throat. That cleared the fog up pretty goddam quick. \u201cThe fuck\u2014?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cJust take it easy, okay?\u201d came Sam Winchester\u2019s voice. \u201cPut the knife down.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Reggie wasn\u2019t stupid enough to do that, especially since he knew that once he did I\u2018d grab it and shove it in his throat. In fact, the knife bit a little more. I felt a small trickle of blood go down my neck. </p>\n\n<p>Now I didn\u2019t know Sam from Adam at the time. He might not care that some woman he\u2019d met for all of five minutes was being used as leverage for whatever the Douchebag Trio, sorry, Duo had in mind. Maybe he\u2019d just fight them off and leave me to my fate. Fortunately for me, the man has a hero complex, a trait that gets him in trouble more often than he would like to admit. \u201cStop!\u201d Sam cried. \u201cIt\u2019s true. What the demons said, it\u2019s all true.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cKeep going,\u201d Tim said, deceptively calm. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhy? You going to hate me any less? Am I going to hate myself any less? What do you want?\u201d Such a whiner. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI want to hear you say it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>There was a moment of quiet. \u201cI did it. I started the Apocalypse.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Oh. Well then. Of course, the details were more convoluted than could be explained in a single sentence, but at the time I was just angry that this over-grown idiot had doomed us all. But before I could express my outrage I was handcuffed to the service station. It was a sign of just how out of it I was that I hadn\u2019t noticed the bracelets sooner. </p>\n\n<p>I pulled at the cuffs, loudly clanging metal against metal, as Tim withdrew a vial of red liquid from his pocket. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d a deeply apprehensive Sam asked. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat do you think it is?\u201d Tim replied triumphantly. \u201cIt\u2019s go juice, Sammy boy.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Demon blood, had to be. The mix of desire and loathing on Sam\u2019s face was ugly. \u201cGet that away from me,\u201d he growled. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cAway from you?\u201d asked Tim. \u201cNo. This is <em>for</em> you. Hell, if that demon wasn\u2019t right as rain. Down the hatch, son.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAre you <em>insane</em>?\u201d I yelled. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what that\u2019s going to do to him! For all we know it\u2019s going to make him kill <em>us</em>, you stupid son of a bitch!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWill you shut that slut up?\u201d Tim barked at his co-conspirator. </p>\n\n<p>Reggie backhanded me. I\u2019m quite sure he\u2019d been wanting to do that ever since I\u2019d dumped his ass. After spitting blood from a bitten cheek onto the floor, I looked up through stray locks of hair and told the motherfucker, \u201cWhen I get out of these you\u2019ll have to eat through a <em>straw</em>.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLook, just leave her alone,\u201d Sam said loudly, \u201cand we can work this out.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Tim ignored him. \u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s gonna happen. You\u2019re gonna drink this, Hulk out, and you\u2019re gonna waste every one of the demon scum that killed my best friend.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Confident I was secured, Reggie joined his friend in advancing on the taller hunter. Tim held out the vial invitingly. \u201cCome on,\u201d he urged, \u201cyou know you want it, Sam. Just reach it and take it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Entranced by the proffered liquid, Sam failed to notice Reggie creeping up to him from the left. In another moment they were grappling and Tim moved forward to force the blood down the Winchester boy\u2019s mouth. </p>\n\n<p>Great, Dumb and Dumber were distracted. I yanked on the cuffs again. No go. Next, I looked about (out of the corner of my eye I could see Sam spitting crimson liquid into Tim\u2019s face). Bottled, cups, and toothpicks. Nothing remotely helpful. </p>\n\n<p>My lockpicks were in my boot. I swung my foot up and used my teeth to undo the laces. Thank you, mom, for insisting I keep up with the gymnastics. As I worked I could hear fists smacking flesh. I wasn\u2019t quite sure who I was rooting for at this point. I just hoped they were too preoccupied to see what I was doing\u2026 and\u2026 success! I pounded my loosened heel on the countertop to drop the kit near my hands. A few seconds later I was free. </p>\n\n<p>When I looked up I saw Sam beating the ever living hell out of Tim. Good\u2026 except Reggie was sneaking up behind him with that stupid knife. I grabbed the nearest mug and hurled it as hard as I could. It hit him right in the face. Even better, his blade dropped to the floor and Sam snatched it up. He held it to Tim\u2019s neck while Reggie spit out a few teeth. </p>\n\n<p>The Winchester boy then looked at <em>me</em>. I don\u2019t know what was on my face, but it made his expression crumple from fury to resignation. He shoved Tim at Reggie. \u201cGo.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Tim rubbed his own neck. \u201cDon\u2019t think we won\u2019t be back.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t think I won\u2019t be here.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The Douchebag Duo left and left me alone with Sam. He approached and reached out at the bruise on my face. \u201cAre you\u2014\u201c</p>\n\n<p>I slapped the hand away. \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d Touching me without permission was a good way to develop a fatal case of steel-in-the-gut. </p>\n\n<p>Sam backed away. \u201cSorry. Let me at least get you some ice.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I didn\u2019t object; my cheek was throbbing. Sam was lifting the gate to get behind the bar when I heard the engine of Steve\u2019s van rev several times. There was no way that thing would survive being rammed into the bar wall so I couldn\u2019t begin to fathom what he was planning. Didn\u2019t have to wait long; a few seconds later a horrible series of crunching and grating noises filtered in. </p>\n\n<p>My blood ran cold. They <em>couldn\u2019t</em> have. \u201cOh, shit,\u201d I gasped and ran through the exit. </p>\n\n<p>Yep. Those dickheads had run over my motorcycle. My poor bike was smashed all to hell, parts strewn in a curve all over the parking lot. Luckily the saddlebag that had ended up scraping along the concrete was the one with my personal effects and <em>not</em> the one with my weaponry. They\u2019d even done the courtesy of tossing my sword and its sheathe out of the camper. Both were lying sadly on the asphalt several feet away. </p>\n\n<p>Sam came out holding a clean rag full of ice as I was silently fuming. The idiot made the mistake of putting a hand on my shoulder while my back was turned and I automatically spun around to plant a fist in his stomach. He let out a <em>whoof</em> and stumbled back a few paces. \u201cOops,\u201d I said. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOw!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I didn\u2019t apologize; he should have known better. Instead I knelt down and got busy unclipping my surviving saddlebag from the wreck that had been my Yamaha. The other one was completely shredded. I pulled it out from under the ruined bike anyways to see if anything had survived. Nope. I discovered my spare clothing had been inadvertently reconstituted as workshop rags with the exception of a single pair of underwear. In an additional insult to injury my toiletries had squelched out and had soaked pretty much everything. </p>\n\n<p>Wonderful. My current shirt and jeans were filthy with blood and sweat and I was in the middle of Nowhere, Oklahoma without a ride. I sat down with my rescued panties hanging pathetically from my fingers and sighed. \u201cGreat. Just fucking great.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cListen,\u201d Sam said as he put the ice pack on my cheek. I flinched, but gratefully held the cold thing to my face. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you at least spend the night at my place? In the morning I can take you wherever you want to go.\u201d I peered up at him suspiciously. \u201cJust a peace offering,\u201d he claimed. </p>\n\n<p>Seeing that there was a dearth of options I told him, \u201cFine.\u201d I stood and walked over to my sword with a scrap of what had been a really comfortable shirt. As I headed back I wiped off the dirt and blood. \u201cNo funny business,\u201d I warned him as I pointed the tip at his chest. </p>\n\n<p>Sam eyed it warily. \u201cYou got it.\u201d</p>\n\n<hr><p>As the shower warmed up I took stock of my remaining belongings. Bow (no arrows; all snapped), sword, wallet, iPhone, compass. Rollup pouch of various blades. Couple of tampons (which, then and now, made Sam deeply uncomfortable), makeup bag that was miraculously untouched, and the (lonely) underwear. </p>\n\n<p>Sam put a shirt, flannel, and a pair of basketball shorts next to my bag. \u201cJust for now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll throw what you\u2019re wearing in the wash.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I grabbed what I needed and headed into the now delightfully steamy bathroom. </p>\n\n<p>After passing my clothing out to Sam I used his soap and shampoo. No wonder the man had such a fluffy coif; the stuff he used was really nice. Now clean, my long, black hair wrapped snugly in a towel, I catalogued bruises and cuts. Nothing major. Worst was the mark on the side of my face, the one out there by a <em>human</em> dickwad. </p>\n\n<p>I unfolded Sam\u2019s shirt and snorted. The thing was a tent. I don\u2019t know what he was thinking; he had almost a foot in height on me. Better than nothing. It was comfy and warm and with the flannel everything would be covered. There was no fitting the shorts, however, no matter how tight I made the drawstring. Oh well. </p>\n\n<p>Sam returned while I was packing up the remains of my meager possessions. He still had my clothes in his hands. \u201cSomeone\u2019s using the washer. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll get to it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I looked around the motel room. There was only one, albeit king-sized, bed and no couch.</p>\n\n<p>He saw what I was doing and declared, \u201cI\u2019ll take the floor.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cThat bed is huge, dumbass. You stay on your side and I\u2019ll stay on mine.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAre you sure? Because\u2014\u201c</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLook, you\u2019re cute, and normally I\u2019d be seeing if you were interested in a good fuck.\u201d Sam flushed. Aw, how precious. Wish I could still picture him that way; what happened between us several months later pretty much scrapped any concepts I had about his innocence. \u201cBut I just got knocked in the head several times, not to mention nearly torn to pieces by a bunch of black-eyed assholes. I want to sleep <em>comfortably</em>. And after those guys knocked <em>you</em> around? I bet you do too.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSomeone also punched me in the stomach,\u201d he said wryly. </p>\n\n<p>I made a disparaging noise before lifting a corner of the covers and climbing into bed. \u201cGood night, Sam.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah. Good night, Eva.\u201d</p>\n\n<hr><p>I was woken up a few hours later when Sam\u2019s lips found my neck. My eyes snapped open and I flipped around. Initially, I was prepared to smack him, but he was staring at me with such affection that I was taken aback. \u201cI love you, Jess,\u201d he murmured. </p>\n\n<p>God, if only I\u2019d known then what this little hallucination of his was heralding I\u2019d have walked out that damn door the second I woke up. I merely thought Sam Winchester was in the grips of some really intense dream. It was either that or I\u2019d taken charity from a delirious nutcase. </p>\n\n<p>Nonplussed, I watched as he turned around and sat at the edge of the bed. \u201cGod knows how much I miss you, too,\u201d Sam said sadly. \u201cBut you\u2019re wrong. People <em>can</em> change. There <em>is</em> reason for hope.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat a crock of shit,\u201d I replied bitterly.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d he asked.</p>\n\n<p>I hesitated. I mean, undoubtedly he was talking to Harvey the Rabbit, but I barely knew the man. It wasn\u2019t really the right time and place to expound on the fallacies of the human race. It was taken out of my hands, however, when Sam jerked around and looked at me in horror. My eyebrows shot up as he stood up and stumbled backwards. \u201c<em>Lucifer</em>.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A chill ran down my spine. I\u2019m in no way religious, especially after everything I\u2019ve seen and been through, but my parents had been devout Christians. I also didn\u2019t have my head in the sand; I knew the Apocalypse that was looming was the <em>biblical</em> Apocalypse, atheists be damned. Sam Winchester had claimed he was responsible. Maybe the guilt had addled his brain. \u201cWhat do you want with me?\u201d he demanded. \u201cI don\u2019t want <em>anything</em> from you.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I glanced around and found my saddlebags set neatly at a table near the window at the opposite side of the room. Damnit, I wanted a knife, but I didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d react if I moved. When I turned back, Sam\u2019s expression had gone from horrified to baffled. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d he asked. </p>\n\n<p>Sam stood and took a few steps back, his gaze pointed at some vague spot on the wall. I guess Satan had gotten to his feet. \u201cNo,\u201d he snarled. \u201cNo. That\u2019ll <em>never</em> happen.\u201d A short pause. \u201cYou need my consent.\u201d And another. \u201cI will <em>kill myself</em> before letting you in.\u201d I really wished I could hear the other half of this bizarre conversation. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d More silence. \u201cWhy me?\u201d His head fell. </p>\n\n<p>When Sam finally raised his head it was to search about as if whomever (or whatever) he\u2019d been talking to had vanished. Much to my consternation those hazel orbs were filled with tears. \u201cSam?\u201d I ventured.</p>\n\n<p>He jumped. \u201cE-Eva?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I went for directness. \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cUh, um, nothing.\u201d Sam turned away. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cSam,\u201d I snapped. He still didn\u2019t look at me. \u201cYou woke me up by <em>kissing me</em>. Then you called me <em>Lucifer</em>.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>That got his attention. He whirled back around. \u201cHow much did you hear?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cEverything <em>you</em> said. So again: what the hell is going on?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>All right, enough of Mystery Man and his enigmatic phantasms. \u201cFuck this, I\u2019m out.\u201d I stood up and whipped off the borrowed flannel. But when I pulled the shirt over my head, fully intending on throwing both things back at their owner, getting dressed, and hitching a ride, his shocked gasp was hard to miss. It wasn\u2019t my sudden nudity; I\u2019d bet Sam Winchester had been treated to much better sights. I\u2019d been so rudely awakened and treated to such a queer spectacle that I\u2019d forgotten I was in his bed as a guest and not a lover, and it meant that I hadn\u2019t warned him about my scars. </p>\n\n<p>They crisscross my back in an irregular pattern. I remember how each of them had been inflicted. This one, here, across my shoulder blades, was from a bullwhip. That one, right under my ribs,\nwas one of a dozen made by a razors he\u2019d kept in a velvet-lined case, blades too small to kill but just right for inflicting pain. The one closest to my nape? His teeth. </p>\n\n<p>After Bobby rescued me, it took months of rehabilitation to get me back on my feet, but once they were healed I\u2019d traveled to Japan. With Bobby\u2019s directions (the man is, quite surprisingly, fluent in Japanese) I\u2019d found a tattoo artist who was also familiar with the supernatural. After two exquisitely torturous days under the needle I had an <em>irezumi</em>, a traditional Japanese tattoo, of a sinuous black dragon curled over my back and buttocks. An anti-possession mark was hidden in its coils along with thirteen Shinto wards meant to ward off evil. It covered nearly all my scars, but in certain lights you could make out every ridge and gouge. </p>\n\n<p>Sam obviously knew he wasn\u2019t looking at the expected inevitable repercussions of living as a hunter. Those would have been scattered, maybe a few on my arms, my legs, my torso. <em>These</em> were concentrated on my back. They\u2019d been artistically inflicted by a sadist, one with centuries of experience. Of course, there was no way he could have known <em>then</em> who and why but his silence spoke volumes. </p>\n\n<p>I slowly put the flannel back over my shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m not telling you,\u201d I said quietly, still not facing the man, \u201cso don\u2019t ask.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d he said gently. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>It was refreshing, and jarring, to meet someone who didn\u2019t pry. Some men wanted salacious details, thinking it might be from a background of rough S&amp;M. Others played the macho card and wanted to know who and whether or not the perpetrator had been punished. Both disgusted me, which is why I normally told some outrageous lie (sorority hazing, Halloween makeup gone wrong, a really aggressive dog), then rode \u2018em and tossed \u2018em in the same night. </p>\n\n<p>Whether Sam would backtrack to appease his curiosity wasn\u2019t a given. Then again, after what I\u2019d seen I was certain he had his own secrets that he didn\u2019t want unearthed. I buttoned up and made a quick decision. \u201cLook. I need a ride to Bobby Singer\u2019s. He obviously knows you so I\u2019m assuming you know him. He hooked me up with my last bike for dirt cheap and I\u2019m pretty damn sure he\u2018ll do it again. If you\u2019re not going to help me then I need to get moving.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll take you.\u201d He wiped a hand down his face. \u201cI was planning on leaving town anyhow.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIs this\u2026 talking to Lucifer thing a nightly occurrence? Should I be prepared?\u201d I had to ask. </p>\n\n<p>Sam chuckled a little, much to my surprise. \u201cNo. I\u2019m pretty sure this was a one time thing.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFantastic. Can I get back to sleep now?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOh. Yeah, yeah, no problem.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I tucked myself back into bed. Sam, however, grabbed his jacket. \u201cWhere you going?\u201d I asked sleepily. </p>\n\n<p>He gave me a small, sad smile. It made me want to cuddle him. I swear he must practice those puppy eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll be back. Just going for a walk.\u201d I made an agreeable noise as he shut the door. </p>\n\n<p>Man, I\u2019d lucked out. Nearly killed by demons, knocked senseless by a complete asshole, and had my ride and belongings completely fucked over. But surprise, surprise! I scored a free ticket to Bobby\u2019s and a handsome companion to get me there. Afterwards, Sam could go his way, I could go mine. No way I wanted to get into whatever issues the Winchester boy was having, <em>especially</em> since he seemed to be directly involved with the Apocalypse. </p>\n\n<p>I wish time travel was more accessible. Stupid, naive past-me really needed a whack upside the head. </p>\n\n<hr><p>We left as early as possible the next day. Sam paid the reckoning for our room and we loaded up his car, a rust yellow Lincoln Continental with ripped seats and a faint smell of cigarettes. I sat in the passenger\u2019s side and popped open the dash. \u201cGeorge Freedman,\u201d I read off the registration. </p>\n\n<p>Sam turned the engine over. \u201cYou really wanna know?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I tossed the slip of paper over my shoulder. \u201cNope.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>It was going to take us about a day to get to Sioux Falls (barring traffic) including some overnight driving. I offered to take the middle stretch and he agreed. </p>\n\n<p>Both of us, by unspoken mutual agreement, made no small talk. We were both content to be lost in our own thoughts, the shifting radio serving as a backdrop. It started on a modern pop station, but somewhere between states it morphed into classic rock. I caught Sam mouthing the words for a few minutes before he grimaced and tuned it to country. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo love for Zepplin?\u201d I asked. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cNah.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>We did a drive thru for lunch but decided to stop at a sit-down place for dinner, some out of the way diner in Missouri. I ordered a Cobb and a water, he did the same. While we waited I hummed a little, not seeing the need to start a conversation. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty tune,\u201d Sam said, killing my attempt to keep myself distant. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cPiece,\u201d I corrected. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOkay, \u2018piece\u2019. What is it?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cChopin\u2019s Prelude in E minor.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou play the piano?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPlayed.\u201d It wasn\u2019t as if I could cart an upright around while I hunted. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cAh.\u201d I resumed humming. Sam, unfortunately, didn\u2019t seem to like awkward silences. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSure.\u201d He could ask, but it wasn\u2019t like I was obligated to answer. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat made you start hunting?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I shrugged. \u201cThing killed my family. Went looking for it. The end.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 vague.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>No shit, Sherlock. I figured Sam was used to people opening up to him almost right away. He flashes those empathetic eyes at them and they cave. Not me. \u201cSo why are <em>you</em> a hunter?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPretty much the same reason.\u201d Our salads arrived and we dug in. \u201cHow long ago?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I lifted an eyebrow. \u201cDoes that matter?\u201d I asked before popping a cherry tomato in my mouth. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI guess not. It\u2019s just\u2026 you seem pretty skilled. No one gets that good right away.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been\u2026 several years. You?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAlmost all my life.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Wait. \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018almost\u2019? Not including the obvious time you were in diapers.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sam poked morosely at some lettuce. \u201cI, um\u2026 I went to college for a bit.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cStanford.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I gave a derisive snort. \u201c<em>Stanford</em>.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He lifted his eyebrows. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be the first person I\u2019ve told that isn\u2019t amazed I went there.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>No lack of ego there. \u201cThat\u2019s because I went to Berkeley.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sam startled me with a bark of genuinely surprised laughter. The rivalry between our two universities was notorious. \u201cYou sure you won\u2019t stab me in my sleep?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBears are <em>inherently</em> better than trees, chump,\u201d I declared, referring to our respective mascots. </p>\n\n<p>Sam continued chuckling as he ate. I speared a slice of hard boiled egg and tried to choke it down. Remembering college inevitably recalled the phone call I\u2019d gotten from the SFPD that cloudy Thursday afternoon, taking the BART into the city while numb with shock, seeing the blood liberally splattered over the walls of the place that had once been my childhood home\u2026</p>\n\n<p>I gave up trying to eat and put my fork aside. After a minute or so Sam did the same. It looked like the path of our conversation had killed both our appetites. I wondered if he\u2019d left Stanford for the same reason I\u2019d left Berkeley. However, I didn\u2019t want to pry and only ruminated about how much tuition money Sam had thrown down the drain. </p>\n\n<p>We choked down a few more bites before asking for the check and getting back on the road. Sam had driven until lunch, I\u2019d been driving since then. We switched about three hours in and I curled up in the back to get some sleep. </p>\n\n<p>Sam woke me up <em>again</em>. I figured if I ever wanted to get a full night\u2019s sleep again it had to be without him anywhere in the vicinity. At least this time there was no unintentional molestation; now he was just talking on the phone. I got the impression that he might have begun the conversation quietly for my sake, but the topic was distracting (not to mention agonizing) enough that courtesy had been forgotten. \u201dHe said <em>I\u2019m</em> the one that\u2019s supposed to be letting him ride around in my skin.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>At least this time I could hear the other person. \u201cSo, you\u2019re his vessel, huh?\u201d they said. Damn, that was one deep voice. I pictured someone taller than Sam with the build of a lumberjack. Beard, belly, plaid, the works. \u201cLucifer\u2019s wearing you to the prom?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he said.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Well, shit. I\u2019d heard about the whole angelic possession thing. A hunter who wanted to survive kept up with new supernatural developments. We all knew that angels were walking the Earth for the first time in thousands of years. They were supposedly powerful, invulnerable, and could freaking <em>teleport</em>. Rumor mill also had it that while demons took unwilling meatsuits, Heaven\u2019s ambassadors needed permission before getting a ride. Therefore Lucifer, who, if I remember correctly, was an archangel, needed <em>Sam\u2019s</em> permission to ride his ass through Armageddon. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2018d fooled myself into thinking that maybe he\u2019d been playing along in order to get the Douchebag Trio\u2014sorry, Duo\u2014off our backs and that maybe last night\u2019s conversation had been the product of some personal issues he was having. Apparently I was an idiot. I\u2019d been watching Lucifer court his fucking vessel and hadn\u2019t had the foresight to do something about it. Well, it looked like I\u2019d been given a second chance. </p>\n\n<p>Quietly and slowly I reached down and unsheathed my sword. \u201cDean, don\u2019t do this,\u201d Sam was pleading. A farewell sounded from the other end and he slowly dropped his phone. </p>\n\n<p>I didn\u2019t want to startle him <em>too</em> much; he was driving, after all, and I didn\u2019t want to end up splattered on the side of the road. Instead, I slid my weapon over Sam\u2019s neck with just enough slowdown so he could acknowledge what was happening. \u201cPull over,\u201d I said softly. </p>\n\n<p>The car drifted to the embankment. \u201cEva\u2014\u201c</p>\n\n<p>\u201cShut the fuck up. If I slit your throat would it all be done?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I felt Sam\u2019s throat bob my blade up and down. \u201cLucifer told me he\u2019d just bring me back.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>It was very likely he telling the truth. There was too much despair in his voice for it to be a ruse. \u201cAnd the other guy?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMy brother.\u201c</p>\n\n<p>If there was anything I could empathize with it was sibling estrangement. Still, I might be able to save a lot of lives by killing him. Or maybe he\u2019d just get resurrected and my altruism would bring the literal wrath of Hell down on my head. Just\u2026 there was a chance I could derail the Apocalypse right here, right now. Or I might doom myself into having a revengeful lumberjack on my ass for the rest of my life. </p>\n\n<p>I vacillated between the two possibilities for a bit too long. With a speed belied by his size Sam\u2018s left arm shot over to grasp the back of my shirt. He yanked me into the front seat and I let out a really undignified squeal. I threw my arms up to prevent my head from slamming into the dash as my blade flew to his feet. </p>\n\n<p>After struggling a bit in the small space I ended up in a one-armed chokehold with my boot heels pressed against the passenger side window. Sam\u2019s left arm was wrapped around my body for additional restraint. Frustrated, I kicked the door and the glass several times before letting myself go slack. \u201cYou done?\u201d Sam asked irritably. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d Even to <em>myself</em> I sounded like a big, pouty baby. </p>\n\n<p>He let me go and moved his tree trunk of a leg so I couldn\u2019t retrieve my sword. \u201cCan we get going now?\u201d </p>\n\n<p>I answered him by slapping him silly. \u201cThat\u2019s for starting the Apocalypse.\u201d I slapped him again. \u201cAnd <em>that\u2019s</em> for Lucifer.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sam palmed his cheek, his eyes wide with outrage. \u201cHe\u2019s not in me right now!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said calmly as I settled down in my seat. \u201cJust make sure he gets it.\u201d After buckling my seatbelt I asked, as sweetly as possible, \u201cCan I have my sword back?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sam grimaced. He used his heel to slide my <em>samjeongdo</em> under his seat. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAsshole.\u201d</p>\n\n<hr><p>When I woke up again it was just after dawn. Sam\u2019s jacket was draped over my shoulders. Nice of him; it wasn\u2019t exactly warm this time of year. Then I saw that we were stopped under a bridge and was pissed; if we were still driving in the right direction and at the same speed we <em>should</em> have been in Sioux Falls. <em>This</em> was definitely <em>not</em> Singer Salvage Yard and that guy that Sam was talking to was <em>not</em> Bobby Singer.</p>\n\n<p>The stranger was slightly shorter than Sam (which still gave him half a foot over me) with a military cut and what were astonishingly handsome features. Man had a chiseled jawline and everything, and the five o\u2019clock shadow only enhanced the package. The way Sam was looking at him, with a mixture of hopefulness and guilt, cemented the fact that this male model wannabe was his brother, Dean. No beard and belly. At least I\u2019d gotten the plaid right. </p>\n\n<p>I watched Dean hand Sam some kind of knife. The former gave the latter what looked like an ultimatum. They came to an agreement, Sam started looking relieved and grateful, and the conversation was over. Time to meet the pretty boy.</p>\n\n<p>I opened the car door and got both of their attentions immediately. I will never forget how Dean\u2019s face went ashen at the sight of me. This was the first time we\u2019d met; there was no reason for him to be looking at me like I was some kind of ghost. </p>\n\n<p>I walked over and stopped near Sam, still meeting Dean\u2019s horrified expression with my own perturbed one. Stupid genetics. These two made me feel like a midget. \u201cWhat?\u201d I snapped. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou,\u201d Dean said breathlessly. \u201cI <em>saw</em> you.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cStalker much?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Sam asked his brother. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cFuture me, man,\u201d Dean said breathlessly. \u201cI caught him lookin\u2019 at this picture of us\u2026 them\u2026 whatever! Kept it in his pocket like some kind of fricking treasure.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sam was as confused as I was, but apparently it was for a different reason. Instead of, \u201cAre you crazy or something?\u201d (which I felt any normal person would have asked) he simply wondered, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBecause he said she was someone he\u2019d loved. And at some point\u2026\u201d Dean swallowed apprehensively and looked over at me. His next words would forever leave a black stain our relationship. \u201cAt some point <em>she died in his arms</em>.\u201d </p>\n\n<hr><p><strong>Acknowledgement</strong> : Some lines of dialogue are taken directly from the episodes \u201cFree to Be You and Me\u201d (SPN 5.03) and \u201cThe End\u201d (SPN 5.04). </p>",

Hunters, we tend to get violent. </p>\n\n<p>My hand shot out and impaled the closest demon, someone\u2019s aging soccer mom. It gave a howl in pain as I ripped out the blade. I turned to face another and ducked under a flying fist. Slit his belly open and watched his guts spill just like Steve\u2019s. Whipped my leg around and kicked him in the temple. </p>\n\n<p>This was a nightmare. I\u2019d never faced more than one demon at a time and now there were <em>ten</em>. I dodged, stabbed, kicked, and made absolutely no impact on their numbers. Even the one I\u2019d disemboweled was getting back to his feet. </p>\n\n<p>One managed to clip me on the head with what felt like a bat. In the few seconds I was dazed another demon locked my arms behind my back. The guy that had hit me got in close, grabbed my chin, and leered. \u201cI wonder what it\u2019s like to fuck a hunter.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>On the surface, what with the claws and fangs and black eyes, monsters seem inhuman, but get down into the basics and they\u2019ve got the same wants and desires as the rest of us. The difference often was whether their natural hunger had been slaked, be it for flesh, brains, or violence. This wasn\u2019t the first time I\u2019d encountered a sociopathic creature aiming to fulfill more base desires and it wouldn\u2019t be the last. </p>\n\n<p>Demon or not, males are still males. \u201cNot interested,\u201d I replied as my knee snapped up between the bastard\u2019s legs. He folded down. I whipped my head back at the one behind me while he was gaping. Soon as my arms were freed I introduced my fist to his face. </p>\n\n<p>Tim and Reggie made a break for the camper and I followed. We climbed into the late Steve\u2019s ride and slammed the doors shut. I watched the demons gather themselves as Tim dropped the keys from the visor and started the engine. The black eyed fuckers smiled as we peeled out of the parking lot. </p>\n\n<p>I sat down on the aisle between the stove and the table in order to catch my breath. All of us were scraped up, bruised, and bloody. From the passenger\u2019s seat, Reggie attempted to console his friend. \u201cTim\u2014\u201c</p>\n\n<p>\u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d the other man snapped. </p>\n\n<p>We drove in silence for several miles, just far enough to feel safe, before Tim pulled to the side of the road. As soon as we were stopped, he began slamming his palms against the steering wheel. \u201cFUCK! FUCK! FUCK!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019re we gonna do?\u201d asked Reggie. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI got me an idea.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTake me back to my bike,\u201d I said as I stood up. I leaned over between the two seats so I could make sure they heard me. \u201cTen demons? Whatever stupid-ass idea you\u2019ve got is suicide.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOkay. But first\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Tim\u2019s fist connected solidly with my temple. Blackout. </p>\n\n<p>Next thing I knew I was being hauled down the camper steps in a fireman\u2019s carry, across black pavement, and through some doorway, its bell blasting in my ears. Through the haze, as I was dropped to my feet, I heard someone cry my name. A moment later a blade was pressed against my throat. That cleared the fog up pretty goddam quick. \u201cThe fuck\u2014?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cJust take it easy, okay?\u201d came Sam Winchester\u2019s voice. \u201cPut the knife down.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Reggie wasn\u2019t stupid enough to do that, especially since he knew that once he did I\u2018d grab it and shove it in his throat. In fact, the knife bit a little more. I felt a small trickle of blood go down my neck. </p>\n\n<p>Now I didn\u2019t know Sam from Adam at the time. He might not care that some woman he\u2019d met for all of five minutes was being used as leverage for whatever the Douchebag Trio, sorry, Duo had in mind. Maybe he\u2019d just fight them off and leave me to my fate. Fortunately for me, the man has a hero complex, a trait that gets him in trouble more often than he would like to admit. \u201cStop!\u201d Sam cried. \u201cIt\u2019s true. What the demons said, it\u2019s all true.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cKeep going,\u201d Tim said, deceptively calm. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhy? You going to hate me any less? Am I going to hate myself any less? What do you want?\u201d Such a whiner. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI want to hear you say it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>There was a moment of quiet. \u201cI did it. I started the Apocalypse.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Oh. Well then. Of course, the details were more convoluted than could be explained in a single sentence, but at the time I was just angry that this over-grown idiot had doomed us all. But before I could express my outrage I was handcuffed to the service station. It was a sign of just how out of it I was that I hadn\u2019t noticed the bracelets sooner. </p>\n\n<p>I pulled at the cuffs, loudly clanging metal against metal, as Tim withdrew a vial of red liquid from his pocket. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d a deeply apprehensive Sam asked. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat do you think it is?\u201d Tim replied triumphantly. \u201cIt\u2019s go juice, Sammy boy.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Demon blood, had to be. The mix of desire and loathing on Sam\u2019s face was ugly. \u201cGet that away from me,\u201d he growled. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cAway from you?\u201d asked Tim. \u201cNo. This is <em>for</em> you. Hell, if that demon wasn\u2019t right as rain. Down the hatch, son.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAre you <em>insane</em>?\u201d I yelled. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what that\u2019s going to do to him! For all we know it\u2019s going to make him kill <em>us</em>, you stupid son of a bitch!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWill you shut that slut up?\u201d Tim barked at his co-conspirator. </p>\n\n<p>Reggie backhanded me. I\u2019m quite sure he\u2019d been wanting to do that ever since I\u2019d dumped his ass. After spitting blood from a bitten cheek onto the floor, I looked up through stray locks of hair and told the motherfucker, \u201cWhen I get out of these you\u2019ll have to eat through a <em>straw</em>.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLook, just leave her alone,\u201d Sam said loudly, \u201cand we can work this out.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Tim ignored him. \u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s gonna happen. You\u2019re gonna drink this, Hulk out, and you\u2019re gonna waste every one of the demon scum that killed my best friend.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Confident I was secured, Reggie joined his friend in advancing on the taller hunter. Tim held out the vial invitingly. \u201cCome on,\u201d he urged, \u201cyou know you want it, Sam. Just reach it and take it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Entranced by the proffered liquid, Sam failed to notice Reggie creeping up to him from the left. In another moment they were grappling and Tim moved forward to force the blood down the Winchester boy\u2019s mouth. </p>\n\n<p>Great, Dumb and Dumber were distracted. I yanked on the cuffs again. No go. Next, I looked about (out of the corner of my eye I could see Sam spitting crimson liquid into Tim\u2019s face). Bottled, cups, and toothpicks. Nothing remotely helpful. </p>\n\n<p>My lockpicks were in my boot. I swung my foot up and used my teeth to undo the laces. Thank you, mom, for insisting I keep up with the gymnastics. As I worked I could hear fists smacking flesh. I wasn\u2019t quite sure who I was rooting for at this point. I just hoped they were too preoccupied to see what I was doing\u2026 and\u2026 success! I pounded my loosened heel on the countertop to drop the kit near my hands. A few seconds later I was free. </p>\n\n<p>When I looked up I saw Sam beating the ever living hell out of Tim. Good\u2026 except Reggie was sneaking up behind him with that stupid knife. I grabbed the nearest mug and hurled it as hard as I could. It hit him right in the face. Even better, his blade dropped to the floor and Sam snatched it up. He held it to Tim\u2019s neck while Reggie spit out a few teeth. </p>\n\n<p>The Winchester boy then looked at <em>me</em>. I don\u2019t know what was on my face, but it made his expression crumple from fury to resignation. He shoved Tim at Reggie. \u201cGo.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Tim rubbed his own neck. \u201cDon\u2019t think we won\u2019t be back.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t think I won\u2019t be here.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The Douchebag Duo left and left me alone with Sam. He approached and reached out at the bruise on my face. \u201cAre you\u2014\u201c</p>\n\n<p>I slapped the hand away. \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d Touching me without permission was a good way to develop a fatal case of steel-in-the-gut. </p>\n\n<p>Sam backed away. \u201cSorry. Let me at least get you some ice.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I didn\u2019t object; my cheek was throbbing. Sam was lifting the gate to get behind the bar when I heard the engine of Steve\u2019s van rev several times. There was no way that thing would survive being rammed into the bar wall so I couldn\u2019t begin to fathom what he was planning. Didn\u2019t have to wait long; a few seconds later a horrible series of crunching and grating noises filtered in. </p>\n\n<p>My blood ran cold. They <em>couldn\u2019t</em> have. \u201cOh, shit,\u201d I gasped and ran through the exit. </p>\n\n<p>Yep. Those dickheads had run over my motorcycle. My poor bike was smashed all to hell, parts strewn in a curve all over the parking lot. Luckily the saddlebag that had ended up scraping along the concrete was the one with my personal effects and <em>not</em> the one with my weaponry. They\u2019d even done the courtesy of tossing my sword and its sheathe out of the camper. Both were lying sadly on the asphalt several feet away. </p>\n\n<p>Sam came out holding a clean rag full of ice as I was silently fuming. The idiot made the mistake of putting a hand on my shoulder while my back was turned and I automatically spun around to plant a fist in his stomach. He let out a <em>whoof</em> and stumbled back a few paces. \u201cOops,\u201d I said. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOw!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I didn\u2019t apologize; he should have known better. Instead I knelt down and got busy unclipping my surviving saddlebag from the wreck that had been my Yamaha. The other one was completely shredded. I pulled it out from under the ruined bike anyways to see if anything had survived. Nope. I discovered my spare clothing had been inadvertently reconstituted as workshop rags with the exception of a single pair of underwear. In an additional insult to injury my toiletries had squelched out and had soaked pretty much everything. </p>\n\n<p>Wonderful. My current shirt and jeans were filthy with blood and sweat and I was in the middle of Nowhere, Oklahoma without a ride. I sat down with my rescued panties hanging pathetically from my fingers and sighed. \u201cGreat. Just fucking great.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cListen,\u201d Sam said as he put the ice pack on my cheek. I flinched, but gratefully held the cold thing to my face. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you at least spend the night at my place? In the morning I can take you wherever you want to go.\u201d I peered up at him suspiciously. \u201cJust a peace offering,\u201d he claimed. </p>\n\n<p>Seeing that there was a dearth of options I told him, \u201cFine.\u201d I stood and walked over to my sword with a scrap of what had been a really comfortable shirt. As I headed back I wiped off the dirt and blood. \u201cNo funny business,\u201d I warned him as I pointed the tip at his chest. </p>\n\n<p>Sam eyed it warily. \u201cYou got it.\u201d</p>\n\n<hr><p>As the shower warmed up I took stock of my remaining belongings. Bow (no arrows; all snapped), sword, wallet, iPhone, compass. Rollup pouch of various blades. Couple of tampons (which, then and now, made Sam deeply uncomfortable), makeup bag that was miraculously untouched, and the (lonely) underwear. </p>\n\n<p>Sam put a shirt, flannel, and a pair of basketball shorts next to my bag. \u201cJust for now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll throw what you\u2019re wearing in the wash.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I grabbed what I needed and headed into the now delightfully steamy bathroom. </p>\n\n<p>After passing my clothing out to Sam I used his soap and shampoo. No wonder the man had such a fluffy coif; the stuff he used was really nice. Now clean, my long, black hair wrapped snugly in a towel, I catalogued bruises and cuts. Nothing major. Worst was the mark on the side of my face, the one out there by a <em>human</em> dickwad. </p>\n\n<p>I unfolded Sam\u2019s shirt and snorted. The thing was a tent. I don\u2019t know what he was thinking; he had almost a foot in height on me. Better than nothing. It was comfy and warm and with the flannel everything would be covered. There was no fitting the shorts, however, no matter how tight I made the drawstring. Oh well. </p>\n\n<p>Sam returned while I was packing up the remains of my meager possessions. He still had my clothes in his hands. \u201cSomeone\u2019s using the washer. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll get to it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I looked around the motel room. There was only one, albeit king-sized, bed and no couch.</p>\n\n<p>He saw what I was doing and declared, \u201cI\u2019ll take the floor.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cThat bed is huge, dumbass. You stay on your side and I\u2019ll stay on mine.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAre you sure? Because\u2014\u201c</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLook, you\u2019re cute, and normally I\u2019d be seeing if you were interested in a good fuck.\u201d Sam flushed. Aw, how precious. Wish I could still picture him that way; what happened between us several months later pretty much scrapped any concepts I had about his innocence. \u201cBut I just got knocked in the head several times, not to mention nearly torn to pieces by a bunch of black-eyed assholes. I want to sleep <em>comfortably</em>. And after those guys knocked <em>you</em> around? I bet you do too.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSomeone also punched me in the stomach,\u201d he said wryly. </p>\n\n<p>I made a disparaging noise before lifting a corner of the covers and climbing into bed. \u201cGood night, Sam.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah. Good night, Eva.\u201d</p>\n\n<hr><p>I was woken up a few hours later when Sam\u2019s lips found my neck. My eyes snapped open and I flipped around. Initially, I was prepared to smack him, but he was staring at me with such affection that I was taken aback. \u201cI love you, Jess,\u201d he murmured. </p>\n\n<p>God, if only I\u2019d known then what this little hallucination of his was heralding I\u2019d have walked out that damn door the second I woke up. I merely thought Sam Winchester was in the grips of some really intense dream. It was either that or I\u2019d taken charity from a delirious nutcase. </p>\n\n<p>Nonplussed, I watched as he turned around and sat at the edge of the bed. \u201cGod knows how much I miss you, too,\u201d Sam said sadly. \u201cBut you\u2019re wrong. People <em>can</em> change. There <em>is</em> reason for hope.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat a crock of shit,\u201d I replied bitterly.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d he asked.</p>\n\n<p>I hesitated. I mean, undoubtedly he was talking to Harvey the Rabbit, but I barely knew the man. It wasn\u2019t really the right time and place to expound on the fallacies of the human race. It was taken out of my hands, however, when Sam jerked around and looked at me in horror. My eyebrows shot up as he stood up and stumbled backwards. \u201c<em>Lucifer</em>.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A chill ran down my spine. I\u2019m in no way religious, especially after everything I\u2019ve seen and been through, but my parents had been devout Christians. I also didn\u2019t have my head in the sand; I knew the Apocalypse that was looming was the <em>biblical</em> Apocalypse, atheists be damned. Sam Winchester had claimed he was responsible. Maybe the guilt had addled his brain. \u201cWhat do you want with me?\u201d he demanded. \u201cI don\u2019t want <em>anything</em> from you.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I glanced around and found my saddlebags set neatly at a table near the window at the opposite side of the room. Damnit, I wanted a knife, but I didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d react if I moved. When I turned back, Sam\u2019s expression had gone from horrified to baffled. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d he asked. </p>\n\n<p>Sam stood and took a few steps back, his gaze pointed at some vague spot on the wall. I guess Satan had gotten to his feet. \u201cNo,\u201d he snarled. \u201cNo. That\u2019ll <em>never</em> happen.\u201d A short pause. \u201cYou need my consent.\u201d And another. \u201cI will <em>kill myself</em> before letting you in.\u201d I really wished I could hear the other half of this bizarre conversation. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d More silence. \u201cWhy me?\u201d His head fell. </p>\n\n<p>When Sam finally raised his head it was to search about as if whomever (or whatever) he\u2019d been talking to had vanished. Much to my consternation those hazel orbs were filled with tears. \u201cSam?\u201d I ventured.</p>\n\n<p>He jumped. \u201cE-Eva?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I went for directness. \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cUh, um, nothing.\u201d Sam turned away. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cSam,\u201d I snapped. He still didn\u2019t look at me. \u201cYou woke me up by <em>kissing me</em>. Then you called me <em>Lucifer</em>.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>That got his attention. He whirled back around. \u201cHow much did you hear?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cEverything <em>you</em> said. So again: what the hell is going on?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>All right, enough of Mystery Man and his enigmatic phantasms. \u201cFuck this, I\u2019m out.\u201d I stood up and whipped off the borrowed flannel. But when I pulled the shirt over my head, fully intending on throwing both things back at their owner, getting dressed, and hitching a ride, his shocked gasp was hard to miss. It wasn\u2019t my sudden nudity; I\u2019d bet Sam Winchester had been treated to much better sights. I\u2019d been so rudely awakened and treated to such a queer spectacle that I\u2019d forgotten I was in his bed as a guest and not a lover, and it meant that I hadn\u2019t warned him about my scars. </p>\n\n<p>They crisscross my back in an irregular pattern. I remember how each of them had been inflicted. This one, here, across my shoulder blades, was from a bullwhip. That one, right under my ribs,\nwas one of a dozen made by a razors he\u2019d kept in a velvet-lined case, blades too small to kill but just right for inflicting pain. The one closest to my nape? His teeth. </p>\n\n<p>After Bobby rescued me, it took months of rehabilitation to get me back on my feet, but once they were healed I\u2019d traveled to Japan. With Bobby\u2019s directions (the man is, quite surprisingly, fluent in Japanese) I\u2019d found a tattoo artist who was also familiar with the supernatural. After two exquisitely torturous days under the needle I had an <em>irezumi</em>, a traditional Japanese tattoo, of a sinuous black dragon curled over my back and buttocks. An anti-possession mark was hidden in its coils along with thirteen Shinto wards meant to ward off evil. It covered nearly all my scars, but in certain lights you could make out every ridge and gouge. </p>\n\n<p>Sam obviously knew he wasn\u2019t looking at the expected inevitable repercussions of living as a hunter. Those would have been scattered, maybe a few on my arms, my legs, my torso. <em>These</em> were concentrated on my back. They\u2019d been artistically inflicted by a sadist, one with centuries of experience. Of course, there was no way he could have known <em>then</em> who and why but his silence spoke volumes. </p>\n\n<p>I slowly put the flannel back over my shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m not telling you,\u201d I said quietly, still not facing the man, \u201cso don\u2019t ask.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d he said gently. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>It was refreshing, and jarring, to meet someone who didn\u2019t pry. Some men wanted salacious details, thinking it might be from a background of rough S&amp;M. Others played the macho card and wanted to know who and whether or not the perpetrator had been punished. Both disgusted me, which is why I normally told some outrageous lie (sorority hazing, Halloween makeup gone wrong, a really aggressive dog), then rode \u2018em and tossed \u2018em in the same night. </p>\n\n<p>Whether Sam would backtrack to appease his curiosity wasn\u2019t a given. Then again, after what I\u2019d seen I was certain he had his own secrets that he didn\u2019t want unearthed. I buttoned up and made a quick decision. \u201cLook. I need a ride to Bobby Singer\u2019s. He obviously knows you so I\u2019m assuming you know him. He hooked me up with my last bike for dirt cheap and I\u2019m pretty damn sure he\u2018ll do it again. If you\u2019re not going to help me then I need to get moving.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll take you.\u201d He wiped a hand down his face. \u201cI was planning on leaving town anyhow.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIs this\u2026 talking to Lucifer thing a nightly occurrence? Should I be prepared?\u201d I had to ask. </p>\n\n<p>Sam chuckled a little, much to my surprise. \u201cNo. I\u2019m pretty sure this was a one time thing.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFantastic. Can I get back to sleep now?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOh. Yeah, yeah, no problem.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I tucked myself back into bed. Sam, however, grabbed his jacket. \u201cWhere you going?\u201d I asked sleepily. </p>\n\n<p>He gave me a small, sad smile. It made me want to cuddle him. I swear he must practice those puppy eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll be back. Just going for a walk.\u201d I made an agreeable noise as he shut the door. </p>\n\n<p>Man, I\u2019d lucked out. Nearly killed by demons, knocked senseless by a complete asshole, and had my ride and belongings completely fucked over. But surprise, surprise! I scored a free ticket to Bobby\u2019s and a handsome companion to get me there. Afterwards, Sam could go his way, I could go mine. No way I wanted to get into whatever issues the Winchester boy was having, <em>especially</em> since he seemed to be directly involved with the Apocalypse. </p>\n\n<p>I wish time travel was more accessible. Stupid, naive past-me really needed a whack upside the head. </p>\n\n<hr><p>We left as early as possible the next day. Sam paid the reckoning for our room and we loaded up his car, a rust yellow Lincoln Continental with ripped seats and a faint smell of cigarettes. I sat in the passenger\u2019s side and popped open the dash. \u201cGeorge Freedman,\u201d I read off the registration. </p>\n\n<p>Sam turned the engine over. \u201cYou really wanna know?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I tossed the slip of paper over my shoulder. \u201cNope.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>It was going to take us about a day to get to Sioux Falls (barring traffic) including some overnight driving. I offered to take the middle stretch and he agreed. </p>\n\n<p>Both of us, by unspoken mutual agreement, made no small talk. We were both content to be lost in our own thoughts, the shifting radio serving as a backdrop. It started on a modern pop station, but somewhere between states it morphed into classic rock. I caught Sam mouthing the words for a few minutes before he grimaced and tuned it to country. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo love for Zepplin?\u201d I asked. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cNah.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>We did a drive thru for lunch but decided to stop at a sit-down place for dinner, some out of the way diner in Missouri. I ordered a Cobb and a water, he did the same. While we waited I hummed a little, not seeing the need to start a conversation. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty tune,\u201d Sam said, killing my attempt to keep myself distant. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cPiece,\u201d I corrected. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOkay, \u2018piece\u2019. What is it?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cChopin\u2019s Prelude in E minor.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou play the piano?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPlayed.\u201d It wasn\u2019t as if I could cart an upright around while I hunted. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cAh.\u201d I resumed humming. Sam, unfortunately, didn\u2019t seem to like awkward silences. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSure.\u201d He could ask, but it wasn\u2019t like I was obligated to answer. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat made you start hunting?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I shrugged. \u201cThing killed my family. Went looking for it. The end.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 vague.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>No shit, Sherlock. I figured Sam was used to people opening up to him almost right away. He flashes those empathetic eyes at them and they cave. Not me. \u201cSo why are <em>you</em> a hunter?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPretty much the same reason.\u201d Our salads arrived and we dug in. \u201cHow long ago?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I lifted an eyebrow. \u201cDoes that matter?\u201d I asked before popping a cherry tomato in my mouth. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI guess not. It\u2019s just\u2026 you seem pretty skilled. No one gets that good right away.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been\u2026 several years. You?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAlmost all my life.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Wait. \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018almost\u2019? Not including the obvious time you were in diapers.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sam poked morosely at some lettuce. \u201cI, um\u2026 I went to college for a bit.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cStanford.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I gave a derisive snort. \u201c<em>Stanford</em>.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He lifted his eyebrows. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be the first person I\u2019ve told that isn\u2019t amazed I went there.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>No lack of ego there. \u201cThat\u2019s because I went to Berkeley.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sam startled me with a bark of genuinely surprised laughter. The rivalry between our two universities was notorious. \u201cYou sure you won\u2019t stab me in my sleep?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBears are <em>inherently</em> better than trees, chump,\u201d I declared, referring to our respective mascots. </p>\n\n<p>Sam continued chuckling as he ate. I speared a slice of hard boiled egg and tried to choke it down. Remembering college inevitably recalled the phone call I\u2019d gotten from the SFPD that cloudy Thursday afternoon, taking the BART into the city while numb with shock, seeing the blood liberally splattered over the walls of the place that had once been my childhood home\u2026</p>\n\n<p>I gave up trying to eat and put my fork aside. After a minute or so Sam did the same. It looked like the path of our conversation had killed both our appetites. I wondered if he\u2019d left Stanford for the same reason I\u2019d left Berkeley. However, I didn\u2019t want to pry and only ruminated about how much tuition money Sam had thrown down the drain. </p>\n\n<p>We choked down a few more bites before asking for the check and getting back on the road. Sam had driven until lunch, I\u2019d been driving since then. We switched about three hours in and I curled up in the back to get some sleep. </p>\n\n<p>Sam woke me up <em>again</em>. I figured if I ever wanted to get a full night\u2019s sleep again it had to be without him anywhere in the vicinity. At least this time there was no unintentional molestation; now he was just talking on the phone. I got the impression that he might have begun the conversation quietly for my sake, but the topic was distracting (not to mention agonizing) enough that courtesy had been forgotten. \u201dHe said <em>I\u2019m</em> the one that\u2019s supposed to be letting him ride around in my skin.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>At least this time I could hear the other person. \u201cSo, you\u2019re his vessel, huh?\u201d they said. Damn, that was one deep voice. I pictured someone taller than Sam with the build of a lumberjack. Beard, belly, plaid, the works. \u201cLucifer\u2019s wearing you to the prom?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he said.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Well, shit. I\u2019d heard about the whole angelic possession thing. A hunter who wanted to survive kept up with new supernatural developments. We all knew that angels were walking the Earth for the first time in thousands of years. They were supposedly powerful, invulnerable, and could freaking <em>teleport</em>. Rumor mill also had it that while demons took unwilling meatsuits, Heaven\u2019s ambassadors needed permission before getting a ride. Therefore Lucifer, who, if I remember correctly, was an archangel, needed <em>Sam\u2019s</em> permission to ride his ass through Armageddon. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2018d fooled myself into thinking that maybe he\u2019d been playing along in order to get the Douchebag Trio\u2014sorry, Duo\u2014off our backs and that maybe last night\u2019s conversation had been the product of some personal issues he was having. Apparently I was an idiot. I\u2019d been watching Lucifer court his fucking vessel and hadn\u2019t had the foresight to do something about it. Well, it looked like I\u2019d been given a second chance. </p>\n\n<p>Quietly and slowly I reached down and unsheathed my sword. \u201cDean, don\u2019t do this,\u201d Sam was pleading. A farewell sounded from the other end and he slowly dropped his phone. </p>\n\n<p>I didn\u2019t want to startle him <em>too</em> much; he was driving, after all, and I didn\u2019t want to end up splattered on the side of the road. Instead, I slid my weapon over Sam\u2019s neck with just enough slowdown so he could acknowledge what was happening. \u201cPull over,\u201d I said softly. </p>\n\n<p>The car drifted to the embankment. \u201cEva\u2014\u201c</p>\n\n<p>\u201cShut the fuck up. If I slit your throat would it all be done?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I felt Sam\u2019s throat bob my blade up and down. \u201cLucifer told me he\u2019d just bring me back.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>It was very likely he telling the truth. There was too much despair in his voice for it to be a ruse. \u201cAnd the other guy?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMy brother.\u201c</p>\n\n<p>If there was anything I could empathize with it was sibling estrangement. Still, I might be able to save a lot of lives by killing him. Or maybe he\u2019d just get resurrected and my altruism would bring the literal wrath of Hell down on my head. Just\u2026 there was a chance I could derail the Apocalypse right here, right now. Or I might doom myself into having a revengeful lumberjack on my ass for the rest of my life. </p>\n\n<p>I vacillated between the two possibilities for a bit too long. With a speed belied by his size Sam\u2018s left arm shot over to grasp the back of my shirt. He yanked me into the front seat and I let out a really undignified squeal. I threw my arms up to prevent my head from slamming into the dash as my blade flew to his feet. </p>\n\n<p>After struggling a bit in the small space I ended up in a one-armed chokehold with my boot heels pressed against the passenger side window. Sam\u2019s left arm was wrapped around my body for additional restraint. Frustrated, I kicked the door and the glass several times before letting myself go slack. \u201cYou done?\u201d Sam asked irritably. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d Even to <em>myself</em> I sounded like a big, pouty baby. </p>\n\n<p>He let me go and moved his tree trunk of a leg so I couldn\u2019t retrieve my sword. \u201cCan we get going now?\u201d </p>\n\n<p>I answered him by slapping him silly. \u201cThat\u2019s for starting the Apocalypse.\u201d I slapped him again. \u201cAnd <em>that\u2019s</em> for Lucifer.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sam palmed his cheek, his eyes wide with outrage. \u201cHe\u2019s not in me right now!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said calmly as I settled down in my seat. \u201cJust make sure he gets it.\u201d After buckling my seatbelt I asked, as sweetly as possible, \u201cCan I have my sword back?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sam grimaced. He used his heel to slide my <em>samjeongdo</em> under his seat. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAsshole.\u201d</p>\n\n<hr><p>When I woke up again it was just after dawn. Sam\u2019s jacket was draped over my shoulders. Nice of him; it wasn\u2019t exactly warm this time of year. Then I saw that we were stopped under a bridge and was pissed; if we were still driving in the right direction and at the same speed we <em>should</em> have been in Sioux Falls. <em>This</em> was definitely <em>not</em> Singer Salvage Yard and that guy that Sam was talking to was <em>not</em> Bobby Singer.</p>\n\n<p>The stranger was slightly shorter than Sam (which still gave him half a foot over me) with a military cut and what were astonishingly handsome features. Man had a chiseled jawline and everything, and the five o\u2019clock shadow only enhanced the package. The way Sam was looking at him, with a mixture of hopefulness and guilt, cemented the fact that this male model wannabe was his brother, Dean. No beard and belly. At least I\u2019d gotten the plaid right. </p>\n\n<p>I watched Dean hand Sam some kind of knife. The former gave the latter what looked like an ultimatum. They came to an agreement, Sam started looking relieved and grateful, and the conversation was over. Time to meet the pretty boy.</p>\n\n<p>I opened the car door and got both of their attentions immediately. I will never forget how Dean\u2019s face went ashen at the sight of me. This was the first time we\u2019d met; there was no reason for him to be looking at me like I was some kind of ghost. </p>\n\n<p>I walked over and stopped near Sam, still meeting Dean\u2019s horrified expression with my own perturbed one. Stupid genetics. These two made me feel like a midget. \u201cWhat?\u201d I snapped. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou,\u201d Dean said breathlessly. \u201cI <em>saw</em> you.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cStalker much?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Sam asked his brother. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cFuture me, man,\u201d Dean said breathlessly. \u201cI caught him lookin\u2019 at this picture of us\u2026 them\u2026 whatever! Kept it in his pocket like some kind of fricking treasure.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sam was as confused as I was, but apparently it was for a different reason. Instead of, \u201cAre you crazy or something?\u201d (which I felt any normal person would have asked) he simply wondered, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBecause he said she was someone he\u2019d loved. And at some point\u2026\u201d Dean swallowed apprehensively and looked over at me. His next words would forever leave a black stain our relationship. \u201cAt some point <em>she died in his arms</em>.\u201d </p>\n\n<hr><p><strong>Acknowledgement</strong> : Some lines of dialogue are taken directly from the episodes \u201cFree to Be You and Me\u201d (SPN 5.03) and \u201cThe End\u201d (SPN 5.04). </p>",
                "content": "<p>You ever completely panic and let your body do whatever it thinks it&rsquo;s supposed to do? Sometimes we shit ourselves, other times we freeze. Hunters, we tend to get violent. </p>\n\n<p>My hand shot out and impaled the closest demon, someone&rsquo;s aging soccer mom. It gave a howl in pain as I ripped out the blade. I turned to face another and ducked under a flying fist. Slit his belly open and watched his guts spill just like Steve&rsquo;s. Whipped my leg around and kicked him in the temple. </p>\n\n<p>This was a nightmare. I&rsquo;d never faced more than one demon at a time and now there were <em>ten</em>. I dodged, stabbed, kicked, and made absolutely no impact on their numbers. Even the one I&rsquo;d disemboweled was getting back to his feet. </p>\n\n<p>One managed to clip me on the head with what felt like a bat. In the few seconds I was dazed another demon locked my arms behind my back. The guy that had hit me got in close, grabbed my chin, and leered. &ldquo;I wonder what it&rsquo;s like to fuck a hunter.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>On the surface, what with the claws and fangs and black eyes, monsters seem inhuman, but get down into the basics and they&rsquo;ve got the same wants and desires as the rest of us. The difference often was whether their natural hunger had been slaked, be it for flesh, brains, or violence. This wasn&rsquo;t the first time I&rsquo;d encountered a sociopathic creature aiming to fulfill more base desires and it wouldn&rsquo;t be the last. </p>\n\n<p>Demon or not, males are still males. &ldquo;Not interested,&rdquo; I replied as my knee snapped up between the bastard&rsquo;s legs. He folded down. I whipped my head back at the one behind me while he was gaping. Soon as my arms were freed I introduced my fist to his face. </p>\n\n<p>Tim and Reggie made a break for the camper and I followed. We climbed into the late Steve&rsquo;s ride and slammed the doors shut. I watched the demons gather themselves as Tim dropped the keys from the visor and started the engine. The black eyed fuckers smiled as we peeled out of the parking lot. </p>\n\n<p>I sat down on the aisle between the stove and the table in order to catch my breath. All of us were scraped up, bruised, and bloody. From the passenger&rsquo;s seat, Reggie attempted to console his friend. &ldquo;Tim&mdash;&ldquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Shut the fuck up,&rdquo; the other man snapped. </p>\n\n<p>We drove in silence for several miles, just far enough to feel safe, before Tim pulled to the side of the road. As soon as we were stopped, he began slamming his palms against the steering wheel. &ldquo;FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;re we gonna do?&rdquo; asked Reggie. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I got me an idea.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Take me back to my bike,&rdquo; I said as I stood up. I leaned over between the two seats so I could make sure they heard me. &ldquo;Ten demons? Whatever stupid-ass idea you&rsquo;ve got is suicide.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Okay. But first&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Tim&rsquo;s fist connected solidly with my temple. Blackout. </p>\n\n<p>Next thing I knew I was being hauled down the camper steps in a fireman&rsquo;s carry, across black pavement, and through some doorway, its bell blasting in my ears. Through the haze, as I was dropped to my feet, I heard someone cry my name. A moment later a blade was pressed against my throat. That cleared the fog up pretty goddam quick. &ldquo;The fuck&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Just take it easy, okay?&rdquo; came Sam Winchester&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Put the knife down.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Reggie wasn&rsquo;t stupid enough to do that, especially since he knew that once he did I&lsquo;d grab it and shove it in his throat. In fact, the knife bit a little more. I felt a small trickle of blood go down my neck. </p>\n\n<p>Now I didn&rsquo;t know Sam from Adam at the time. He might not care that some woman he&rsquo;d met for all of five minutes was being used as leverage for whatever the Douchebag Trio, sorry, Duo had in mind. Maybe he&rsquo;d just fight them off and leave me to my fate. Fortunately for me, the man has a hero complex, a trait that gets him in trouble more often than he would like to admit. &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Sam cried. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true. What the demons said, it&rsquo;s all true.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Keep going,&rdquo; Tim said, deceptively calm. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Why? You going to hate me any less? Am I going to hate myself any less? What do you want?&rdquo; Such a whiner. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I want to hear you say it.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>There was a moment of quiet. &ldquo;I did it. I started the Apocalypse.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Oh. Well then. Of course, the details were more convoluted than could be explained in a single sentence, but at the time I was just angry that this over-grown idiot had doomed us all. But before I could express my outrage I was handcuffed to the service station. It was a sign of just how out of it I was that I hadn&rsquo;t noticed the bracelets sooner. </p>\n\n<p>I pulled at the cuffs, loudly clanging metal against metal, as Tim withdrew a vial of red liquid from his pocket. &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; a deeply apprehensive Sam asked. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What do you think it is?&rdquo; Tim replied triumphantly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s go juice, Sammy boy.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Demon blood, had to be. The mix of desire and loathing on Sam&rsquo;s face was ugly. &ldquo;Get that away from me,&rdquo; he growled. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Away from you?&rdquo; asked Tim. &ldquo;No. This is <em>for</em> you. Hell, if that demon wasn&rsquo;t right as rain. Down the hatch, son.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Are you <em>insane</em>?&rdquo; I yelled. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what that&rsquo;s going to do to him! For all we know it&rsquo;s going to make him kill <em>us</em>, you stupid son of a bitch!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Will you shut that slut up?&rdquo; Tim barked at his co-conspirator. </p>\n\n<p>Reggie backhanded me. I&rsquo;m quite sure he&rsquo;d been wanting to do that ever since I&rsquo;d dumped his ass. After spitting blood from a bitten cheek onto the floor, I looked up through stray locks of hair and told the motherfucker, &ldquo;When I get out of these you&rsquo;ll have to eat through a <em>straw</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Look, just leave her alone,&rdquo; Sam said loudly, &ldquo;and we can work this out.&rdquo; </p>\n\n<p>Tim ignored him. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s gonna happen. You&rsquo;re gonna drink this, Hulk out, and you&rsquo;re gonna waste every one of the demon scum that killed my best friend.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Confident I was secured, Reggie joined his friend in advancing on the taller hunter. Tim held out the vial invitingly. &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he urged, &ldquo;you know you want it, Sam. Just reach it and take it.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Entranced by the proffered liquid, Sam failed to notice Reggie creeping up to him from the left. In another moment they were grappling and Tim moved forward to force the blood down the Winchester boy&rsquo;s mouth. </p>\n\n<p>Great, Dumb and Dumber were distracted. I yanked on the cuffs again. No go. Next, I looked about (out of the corner of my eye I could see Sam spitting crimson liquid into Tim&rsquo;s face). Bottled, cups, and toothpicks. Nothing remotely helpful. </p>\n\n<p>My lockpicks were in my boot. I swung my foot up and used my teeth to undo the laces. Thank you, mom, for insisting I keep up with the gymnastics. As I worked I could hear fists smacking flesh. I wasn&rsquo;t quite sure who I was rooting for at this point. I just hoped they were too preoccupied to see what I was doing&hellip; and&hellip; success! I pounded my loosened heel on the countertop to drop the kit near my hands. A few seconds later I was free. </p>\n\n<p>When I looked up I saw Sam beating the ever living hell out of Tim. Good&hellip; except Reggie was sneaking up behind him with that stupid knife. I grabbed the nearest mug and hurled it as hard as I could. It hit him right in the face. Even better, his blade dropped to the floor and Sam snatched it up. He held it to Tim&rsquo;s neck while Reggie spit out a few teeth. </p>\n\n<p>The Winchester boy then looked at <em>me</em>. I don&rsquo;t know what was on my face, but it made his expression crumple from fury to resignation. He shoved Tim at Reggie. &ldquo;Go.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Tim rubbed his own neck. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think we won&rsquo;t be back.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think I won&rsquo;t be here.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The Douchebag Duo left and left me alone with Sam. He approached and reached out at the bruise on my face. &ldquo;Are you&mdash;&ldquo;</p>\n\n<p>I slapped the hand away. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Touching me without permission was a good way to develop a fatal case of steel-in-the-gut. </p>\n\n<p>Sam backed away. &ldquo;Sorry. Let me at least get you some ice.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I didn&rsquo;t object; my cheek was throbbing. Sam was lifting the gate to get behind the bar when I heard the engine of Steve&rsquo;s van rev several times. There was no way that thing would survive being rammed into the bar wall so I couldn&rsquo;t begin to fathom what he was planning. Didn&rsquo;t have to wait long; a few seconds later a horrible series of crunching and grating noises filtered in. </p>\n\n<p>My blood ran cold. They <em>couldn&rsquo;t</em> have. &ldquo;Oh, shit,&rdquo; I gasped and ran through the exit. </p>\n\n<p>Yep. Those dickheads had run over my motorcycle. My poor bike was smashed all to hell, parts strewn in a curve all over the parking lot. Luckily the saddlebag that had ended up scraping along the concrete was the one with my personal effects and <em>not</em> the one with my weaponry. They&rsquo;d even done the courtesy of tossing my sword and its sheathe out of the camper. Both were lying sadly on the asphalt several feet away. </p>\n\n<p>Sam came out holding a clean rag full of ice as I was silently fuming. The idiot made the mistake of putting a hand on my shoulder while my back was turned and I automatically spun around to plant a fist in his stomach. He let out a <em>whoof</em> and stumbled back a few paces. &ldquo;Oops,&rdquo; I said. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Ow!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I didn&rsquo;t apologize; he should have known better. Instead I knelt down and got busy unclipping my surviving saddlebag from the wreck that had been my Yamaha. The other one was completely shredded. I pulled it out from under the ruined bike anyways to see if anything had survived. Nope. I discovered my spare clothing had been inadvertently reconstituted as workshop rags with the exception of a single pair of underwear. In an additional insult to injury my toiletries had squelched out and had soaked pretty much everything. </p>\n\n<p>Wonderful. My current shirt and jeans were filthy with blood and sweat and I was in the middle of Nowhere, Oklahoma without a ride. I sat down with my rescued panties hanging pathetically from my fingers and sighed. &ldquo;Great. Just fucking great.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; Sam said as he put the ice pack on my cheek. I flinched, but gratefully held the cold thing to my face. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you at least spend the night at my place? In the morning I can take you wherever you want to go.&rdquo; I peered up at him suspiciously. &ldquo;Just a peace offering,&rdquo; he claimed. </p>\n\n<p>Seeing that there was a dearth of options I told him, &ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; I stood and walked over to my sword with a scrap of what had been a really comfortable shirt. As I headed back I wiped off the dirt and blood. &ldquo;No funny business,&rdquo; I warned him as I pointed the tip at his chest. </p>\n\n<p>Sam eyed it warily. &ldquo;You got it.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<hr /><p>As the shower warmed up I took stock of my remaining belongings. Bow (no arrows; all snapped), sword, wallet, iPhone, compass. Rollup pouch of various blades. Couple of tampons (which, then and now, made Sam deeply uncomfortable), makeup bag that was miraculously untouched, and the (lonely) underwear. </p>\n\n<p>Sam put a shirt, flannel, and a pair of basketball shorts next to my bag. &ldquo;Just for now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll throw what you&rsquo;re wearing in the wash.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; I grabbed what I needed and headed into the now delightfully steamy bathroom. </p>\n\n<p>After passing my clothing out to Sam I used his soap and shampoo. No wonder the man had such a fluffy coif; the stuff he used was really nice. Now clean, my long, black hair wrapped snugly in a towel, I catalogued bruises and cuts. Nothing major. Worst was the mark on the side of my face, the one out there by a <em>human</em> dickwad. </p>\n\n<p>I unfolded Sam&rsquo;s shirt and snorted. The thing was a tent. I don&rsquo;t know what he was thinking; he had almost a foot in height on me. Better than nothing. It was comfy and warm and with the flannel everything would be covered. There was no fitting the shorts, however, no matter how tight I made the drawstring. Oh well. </p>\n\n<p>Sam returned while I was packing up the remains of my meager possessions. He still had my clothes in his hands. &ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s using the washer. Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll get to it.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; I looked around the motel room. There was only one, albeit king-sized, bed and no couch.</p>\n\n<p>He saw what I was doing and declared, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the floor.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I rolled my eyes. &ldquo;That bed is huge, dumbass. You stay on your side and I&rsquo;ll stay on mine.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Are you sure? Because&mdash;&ldquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Look, you&rsquo;re cute, and normally I&rsquo;d be seeing if you were interested in a good fuck.&rdquo; Sam flushed. Aw, how precious. Wish I could still picture him that way; what happened between us several months later pretty much scrapped any concepts I had about his innocence. &ldquo;But I just got knocked in the head several times, not to mention nearly torn to pieces by a bunch of black-eyed assholes. I want to sleep <em>comfortably</em>. And after those guys knocked <em>you</em> around? I bet you do too.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Someone also punched me in the stomach,&rdquo; he said wryly. </p>\n\n<p>I made a disparaging noise before lifting a corner of the covers and climbing into bed. &ldquo;Good night, Sam.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah. Good night, Eva.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<hr /><p>I was woken up a few hours later when Sam&rsquo;s lips found my neck. My eyes snapped open and I flipped around. Initially, I was prepared to smack him, but he was staring at me with such affection that I was taken aback. &ldquo;I love you, Jess,&rdquo; he murmured. </p>\n\n<p>God, if only I&rsquo;d known then what this little hallucination of his was heralding I&rsquo;d have walked out that damn door the second I woke up. I merely thought Sam Winchester was in the grips of some really intense dream. It was either that or I&rsquo;d taken charity from a delirious nutcase. </p>\n\n<p>Nonplussed, I watched as he turned around and sat at the edge of the bed. &ldquo;God knows how much I miss you, too,&rdquo; Sam said sadly. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re wrong. People <em>can</em> change. There <em>is</em> reason for hope.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What a crock of shit,&rdquo; I replied bitterly.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;How can you be so sure?&rdquo; he asked.</p>\n\n<p>I hesitated. I mean, undoubtedly he was talking to Harvey the Rabbit, but I barely knew the man. It wasn&rsquo;t really the right time and place to expound on the fallacies of the human race. It was taken out of my hands, however, when Sam jerked around and looked at me in horror. My eyebrows shot up as he stood up and stumbled backwards. &ldquo;<em>Lucifer</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>A chill ran down my spine. I&rsquo;m in no way religious, especially after everything I&rsquo;ve seen and been through, but my parents had been devout Christians. I also didn&rsquo;t have my head in the sand; I knew the Apocalypse that was looming was the <em>biblical</em> Apocalypse, atheists be damned. Sam Winchester had claimed he was responsible. Maybe the guilt had addled his brain. &ldquo;What do you want with me?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want <em>anything</em> from you.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I glanced around and found my saddlebags set neatly at a table near the window at the opposite side of the room. Damnit, I wanted a knife, but I didn&rsquo;t know how he&rsquo;d react if I moved. When I turned back, Sam&rsquo;s expression had gone from horrified to baffled. &ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; he asked. </p>\n\n<p>Sam stood and took a few steps back, his gaze pointed at some vague spot on the wall. I guess Satan had gotten to his feet. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;No. That&rsquo;ll <em>never</em> happen.&rdquo; A short pause. &ldquo;You need my consent.&rdquo; And another. &ldquo;I will <em>kill myself</em> before letting you in.&rdquo; I really wished I could hear the other half of this bizarre conversation. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong.&rdquo; More silence. &ldquo;Why me?&rdquo; His head fell. </p>\n\n<p>When Sam finally raised his head it was to search about as if whomever (or whatever) he&rsquo;d been talking to had vanished. Much to my consternation those hazel orbs were filled with tears. &ldquo;Sam?&rdquo; I ventured.</p>\n\n<p>He jumped. &ldquo;E-Eva?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I went for directness. &ldquo;What the hell is going on?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Uh, um, nothing.&rdquo; Sam turned away. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; I snapped. He still didn&rsquo;t look at me. &ldquo;You woke me up by <em>kissing me</em>. Then you called me <em>Lucifer</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>That got his attention. He whirled back around. &ldquo;How much did you hear?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Everything <em>you</em> said. So again: what the hell is going on?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; It&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>All right, enough of Mystery Man and his enigmatic phantasms. &ldquo;Fuck this, I&rsquo;m out.&rdquo; I stood up and whipped off the borrowed flannel. But when I pulled the shirt over my head, fully intending on throwing both things back at their owner, getting dressed, and hitching a ride, his shocked gasp was hard to miss. It wasn&rsquo;t my sudden nudity; I&rsquo;d bet Sam Winchester had been treated to much better sights. I&rsquo;d been so rudely awakened and treated to such a queer spectacle that I&rsquo;d forgotten I was in his bed as a guest and not a lover, and it meant that I hadn&rsquo;t warned him about my scars. </p>\n\n<p>They crisscross my back in an irregular pattern. I remember how each of them had been inflicted. This one, here, across my shoulder blades, was from a bullwhip. That one, right under my ribs,\nwas one of a dozen made by a razors he&rsquo;d kept in a velvet-lined case, blades too small to kill but just right for inflicting pain. The one closest to my nape? His teeth. </p>\n\n<p>After Bobby rescued me, it took months of rehabilitation to get me back on my feet, but once they were healed I&rsquo;d traveled to Japan. With Bobby&rsquo;s directions (the man is, quite surprisingly, fluent in Japanese) I&rsquo;d found a tattoo artist who was also familiar with the supernatural. After two exquisitely torturous days under the needle I had an <em>irezumi</em>, a traditional Japanese tattoo, of a sinuous black dragon curled over my back and buttocks. An anti-possession mark was hidden in its coils along with thirteen Shinto wards meant to ward off evil. It covered nearly all my scars, but in certain lights you could make out every ridge and gouge. </p>\n\n<p>Sam obviously knew he wasn&rsquo;t looking at the expected inevitable repercussions of living as a hunter. Those would have been scattered, maybe a few on my arms, my legs, my torso. <em>These</em> were concentrated on my back. They&rsquo;d been artistically inflicted by a sadist, one with centuries of experience. Of course, there was no way he could have known <em>then</em> who and why but his silence spoke volumes. </p>\n\n<p>I slowly put the flannel back over my shoulders. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not telling you,&rdquo; I said quietly, still not facing the man, &ldquo;so don&rsquo;t ask.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>It was refreshing, and jarring, to meet someone who didn&rsquo;t pry. Some men wanted salacious details, thinking it might be from a background of rough S&amp;M. Others played the macho card and wanted to know who and whether or not the perpetrator had been punished. Both disgusted me, which is why I normally told some outrageous lie (sorority hazing, Halloween makeup gone wrong, a really aggressive dog), then rode &lsquo;em and tossed &lsquo;em in the same night. </p>\n\n<p>Whether Sam would backtrack to appease his curiosity wasn&rsquo;t a given. Then again, after what I&rsquo;d seen I was certain he had his own secrets that he didn&rsquo;t want unearthed. I buttoned up and made a quick decision. &ldquo;Look. I need a ride to Bobby Singer&rsquo;s. He obviously knows you so I&rsquo;m assuming you know him. He hooked me up with my last bike for dirt cheap and I&rsquo;m pretty damn sure he&lsquo;ll do it again. If you&rsquo;re not going to help me then I need to get moving.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll take you.&rdquo; He wiped a hand down his face. &ldquo;I was planning on leaving town anyhow.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Is this&hellip; talking to Lucifer thing a nightly occurrence? Should I be prepared?&rdquo; I had to ask. </p>\n\n<p>Sam chuckled a little, much to my surprise. &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m pretty sure this was a one time thing.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Fantastic. Can I get back to sleep now?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Oh. Yeah, yeah, no problem.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I tucked myself back into bed. Sam, however, grabbed his jacket. &ldquo;Where you going?&rdquo; I asked sleepily. </p>\n\n<p>He gave me a small, sad smile. It made me want to cuddle him. I swear he must practice those puppy eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back. Just going for a walk.&rdquo; I made an agreeable noise as he shut the door. </p>\n\n<p>Man, I&rsquo;d lucked out. Nearly killed by demons, knocked senseless by a complete asshole, and had my ride and belongings completely fucked over. But surprise, surprise! I scored a free ticket to Bobby&rsquo;s and a handsome companion to get me there. Afterwards, Sam could go his way, I could go mine. No way I wanted to get into whatever issues the Winchester boy was having, <em>especially</em> since he seemed to be directly involved with the Apocalypse. </p>\n\n<p>I wish time travel was more accessible. Stupid, naive past-me really needed a whack upside the head. </p>\n\n<hr /><p>We left as early as possible the next day. Sam paid the reckoning for our room and we loaded up his car, a rust yellow Lincoln Continental with ripped seats and a faint smell of cigarettes. I sat in the passenger&rsquo;s side and popped open the dash. &ldquo;George Freedman,&rdquo; I read off the registration. </p>\n\n<p>Sam turned the engine over. &ldquo;You really wanna know?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I tossed the slip of paper over my shoulder. &ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>It was going to take us about a day to get to Sioux Falls (barring traffic) including some overnight driving. I offered to take the middle stretch and he agreed. </p>\n\n<p>Both of us, by unspoken mutual agreement, made no small talk. We were both content to be lost in our own thoughts, the shifting radio serving as a backdrop. It started on a modern pop station, but somewhere between states it morphed into classic rock. I caught Sam mouthing the words for a few minutes before he grimaced and tuned it to country. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;No love for Zepplin?&rdquo; I asked. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Nah.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>We did a drive thru for lunch but decided to stop at a sit-down place for dinner, some out of the way diner in Missouri. I ordered a Cobb and a water, he did the same. While we waited I hummed a little, not seeing the need to start a conversation. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pretty tune,&rdquo; Sam said, killing my attempt to keep myself distant. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Piece,&rdquo; I corrected. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Okay, &lsquo;piece&rsquo;. What is it?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Chopin&rsquo;s Prelude in E minor.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You play the piano?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Played.&rdquo; It wasn&rsquo;t as if I could cart an upright around while I hunted. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo; I resumed humming. Sam, unfortunately, didn&rsquo;t seem to like awkward silences. &ldquo;Can I ask you something?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; He could ask, but it wasn&rsquo;t like I was obligated to answer. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What made you start hunting?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I shrugged. &ldquo;Thing killed my family. Went looking for it. The end.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; vague.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>No shit, Sherlock. I figured Sam was used to people opening up to him almost right away. He flashes those empathetic eyes at them and they cave. Not me. &ldquo;So why are <em>you</em> a hunter?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Pretty much the same reason.&rdquo; Our salads arrived and we dug in. &ldquo;How long ago?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I lifted an eyebrow. &ldquo;Does that matter?&rdquo; I asked before popping a cherry tomato in my mouth. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I guess not. It&rsquo;s just&hellip; you seem pretty skilled. No one gets that good right away.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been&hellip; several years. You?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Almost all my life.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Wait. &ldquo;What do you mean &lsquo;almost&rsquo;? Not including the obvious time you were in diapers.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Sam poked morosely at some lettuce. &ldquo;I, um&hellip; I went to college for a bit.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Stanford.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I gave a derisive snort. &ldquo;<em>Stanford</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>He lifted his eyebrows. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to be the first person I&rsquo;ve told that isn&rsquo;t amazed I went there.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>No lack of ego there. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because I went to Berkeley.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Sam startled me with a bark of genuinely surprised laughter. The rivalry between our two universities was notorious. &ldquo;You sure you won&rsquo;t stab me in my sleep?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Bears are <em>inherently</em> better than trees, chump,&rdquo; I declared, referring to our respective mascots. </p>\n\n<p>Sam continued chuckling as he ate. I speared a slice of hard boiled egg and tried to choke it down. Remembering college inevitably recalled the phone call I&rsquo;d gotten from the SFPD that cloudy Thursday afternoon, taking the BART into the city while numb with shock, seeing the blood liberally splattered over the walls of the place that had once been my childhood home&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>I gave up trying to eat and put my fork aside. After a minute or so Sam did the same. It looked like the path of our conversation had killed both our appetites. I wondered if he&rsquo;d left Stanford for the same reason I&rsquo;d left Berkeley. However, I didn&rsquo;t want to pry and only ruminated about how much tuition money Sam had thrown down the drain. </p>\n\n<p>We choked down a few more bites before asking for the check and getting back on the road. Sam had driven until lunch, I&rsquo;d been driving since then. We switched about three hours in and I curled up in the back to get some sleep. </p>\n\n<p>Sam woke me up <em>again</em>. I figured if I ever wanted to get a full night&rsquo;s sleep again it had to be without him anywhere in the vicinity. At least this time there was no unintentional molestation; now he was just talking on the phone. I got the impression that he might have begun the conversation quietly for my sake, but the topic was distracting (not to mention agonizing) enough that courtesy had been forgotten. &rdquo;He said <em>I&rsquo;m</em> the one that&rsquo;s supposed to be letting him ride around in my skin.&rdquo; </p>\n\n<p>At least this time I could hear the other person. &ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re his vessel, huh?&rdquo; they said. Damn, that was one deep voice. I pictured someone taller than Sam with the build of a lumberjack. Beard, belly, plaid, the works. &ldquo;Lucifer&rsquo;s wearing you to the prom?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he said.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Well, shit. I&rsquo;d heard about the whole angelic possession thing. A hunter who wanted to survive kept up with new supernatural developments. We all knew that angels were walking the Earth for the first time in thousands of years. They were supposedly powerful, invulnerable, and could freaking <em>teleport</em>. Rumor mill also had it that while demons took unwilling meatsuits, Heaven&rsquo;s ambassadors needed permission before getting a ride. Therefore Lucifer, who, if I remember correctly, was an archangel, needed <em>Sam&rsquo;s</em> permission to ride his ass through Armageddon. </p>\n\n<p>I&lsquo;d fooled myself into thinking that maybe he&rsquo;d been playing along in order to get the Douchebag Trio&mdash;sorry, Duo&mdash;off our backs and that maybe last night&rsquo;s conversation had been the product of some personal issues he was having. Apparently I was an idiot. I&rsquo;d been watching Lucifer court his fucking vessel and hadn&rsquo;t had the foresight to do something about it. Well, it looked like I&rsquo;d been given a second chance. </p>\n\n<p>Quietly and slowly I reached down and unsheathed my sword. &ldquo;Dean, don&rsquo;t do this,&rdquo; Sam was pleading. A farewell sounded from the other end and he slowly dropped his phone. </p>\n\n<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to startle him <em>too</em> much; he was driving, after all, and I didn&rsquo;t want to end up splattered on the side of the road. Instead, I slid my weapon over Sam&rsquo;s neck with just enough slowdown so he could acknowledge what was happening. &ldquo;Pull over,&rdquo; I said softly. </p>\n\n<p>The car drifted to the embankment. &ldquo;Eva&mdash;&ldquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Shut the fuck up. If I slit your throat would it all be done?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I felt Sam&rsquo;s throat bob my blade up and down. &ldquo;Lucifer told me he&rsquo;d just bring me back.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>It was very likely he telling the truth. There was too much despair in his voice for it to be a ruse. &ldquo;And the other guy?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;My brother.&ldquo;</p>\n\n<p>If there was anything I could empathize with it was sibling estrangement. Still, I might be able to save a lot of lives by killing him. Or maybe he&rsquo;d just get resurrected and my altruism would bring the literal wrath of Hell down on my head. Just&hellip; there was a chance I could derail the Apocalypse right here, right now. Or I might doom myself into having a revengeful lumberjack on my ass for the rest of my life. </p>\n\n<p>I vacillated between the two possibilities for a bit too long. With a speed belied by his size Sam&lsquo;s left arm shot over to grasp the back of my shirt. He yanked me into the front seat and I let out a really undignified squeal. I threw my arms up to prevent my head from slamming into the dash as my blade flew to his feet. </p>\n\n<p>After struggling a bit in the small space I ended up in a one-armed chokehold with my boot heels pressed against the passenger side window. Sam&rsquo;s left arm was wrapped around my body for additional restraint. Frustrated, I kicked the door and the glass several times before letting myself go slack. &ldquo;You done?&rdquo; Sam asked irritably. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Even to <em>myself</em> I sounded like a big, pouty baby. </p>\n\n<p>He let me go and moved his tree trunk of a leg so I couldn&rsquo;t retrieve my sword. &ldquo;Can we get going now?&rdquo; </p>\n\n<p>I answered him by slapping him silly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s for starting the Apocalypse.&rdquo; I slapped him again. &ldquo;And <em>that&rsquo;s</em> for Lucifer.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Sam palmed his cheek, his eyes wide with outrage. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not in me right now!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; I said calmly as I settled down in my seat. &ldquo;Just make sure he gets it.&rdquo; After buckling my seatbelt I asked, as sweetly as possible, &ldquo;Can I have my sword back?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Sam grimaced. He used his heel to slide my <em>samjeongdo</em> under his seat. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Asshole.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<hr /><p>When I woke up again it was just after dawn. Sam&rsquo;s jacket was draped over my shoulders. Nice of him; it wasn&rsquo;t exactly warm this time of year. Then I saw that we were stopped under a bridge and was pissed; if we were still driving in the right direction and at the same speed we <em>should</em> have been in Sioux Falls. <em>This</em> was definitely <em>not</em> Singer Salvage Yard and that guy that Sam was talking to was <em>not</em> Bobby Singer.</p>\n\n<p>The stranger was slightly shorter than Sam (which still gave him half a foot over me) with a military cut and what were astonishingly handsome features. Man had a chiseled jawline and everything, and the five o&rsquo;clock shadow only enhanced the package. The way Sam was looking at him, with a mixture of hopefulness and guilt, cemented the fact that this male model wannabe was his brother, Dean. No beard and belly. At least I&rsquo;d gotten the plaid right. </p>\n\n<p>I watched Dean hand Sam some kind of knife. The former gave the latter what looked like an ultimatum. They came to an agreement, Sam started looking relieved and grateful, and the conversation was over. Time to meet the pretty boy.</p>\n\n<p>I opened the car door and got both of their attentions immediately. I will never forget how Dean&rsquo;s face went ashen at the sight of me. This was the first time we&rsquo;d met; there was no reason for him to be looking at me like I was some kind of ghost. </p>\n\n<p>I walked over and stopped near Sam, still meeting Dean&rsquo;s horrified expression with my own perturbed one. Stupid genetics. These two made me feel like a midget. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; I snapped. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You,&rdquo; Dean said breathlessly. &ldquo;I <em>saw</em> you.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Stalker much?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; Sam asked his brother. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Future me, man,&rdquo; Dean said breathlessly. &ldquo;I caught him lookin&rsquo; at this picture of us&hellip; them&hellip; whatever! Kept it in his pocket like some kind of fricking treasure.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Sam was as confused as I was, but apparently it was for a different reason. Instead of, &ldquo;Are you crazy or something?&rdquo; (which I felt any normal person would have asked) he simply wondered, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Because he said she was someone he&rsquo;d loved. And at some point&hellip;&rdquo; Dean swallowed apprehensively and looked over at me. His next words would forever leave a black stain our relationship. &ldquo;At some point <em>she died in his arms</em>.&rdquo; </p>\n\n<hr /><p><strong>Acknowledgement</strong> : Some lines of dialogue are taken directly from the episodes &ldquo;Free to Be You and Me&rdquo; (SPN 5.03) and &ldquo;The End&rdquo; (SPN 5.04). </p>",
