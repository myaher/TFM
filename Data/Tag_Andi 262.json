The way they were just able to open up to each other when they were still practically strangers at the time was beautiful. There\u2019s no denying the instant chemistry and the connection they made in this moment. I also loved how TJ ended up pushing Cyrus higher on the swings because it symbolizes how he is the only one who really ever pushed Cyrus out of his comfort zone and the first one to really believe he can do anything he sets his mind to (as we see in the muffin scene). And even after all the fun, Cyrus didn\u2019t want any of it to end because he then tells TJ if he ever needed him, he\u2019d be there and you can see the hopeful look on TJ\u2019s face because I think in that moment he realized he truly made a friend (I don\u2019t think his basketball posse are considered his\u00a0\u201creal\u201d friends because they didn\u2019t care he got benched and had no problem with Buffy replacing him as captain). TJ also ends up<i> thanking </i>Cyrus for reminding him of swinging, which I just basically saw as him saying he was able to just let loose and be himself, not worrying about putting up his tough guy act and just being a kid in that moment. And I think after that moment they shared, Cyrus started to see the good in TJ (not caring what Andi or Buffy thinks of him) because in the mobile text app, he mentions the\u00a0\u201csubtext\u201d going on and he knew TJ had a lot of deep seeded issues and saw he was basically crying for help.

TJ also ends up<i> thanking </i>Cyrus for reminding him of swinging, which I just basically saw as him saying he was able to just let loose and be himself, not worrying about putting up his tough guy act and just being a kid in that moment. And I think after that moment they shared, Cyrus started to see the good in TJ (not caring what Andi or Buffy thinks of him) because in the mobile text app, he mentions the&nbsp;&ldquo;subtext&rdquo; going on and he knew TJ had a lot of deep seeded issues and saw he was basically crying for help. TJ was the first to believe in Cyrus then Cyrus started to believe in TJ and knew he could and <i>would</i> change into a better person.</p><p>And I think the swing scene just meant a lot to the both of them because they found comfort in each other, but especially for Cyrus because he told Buffy about how TJ was there for him when he had a panic attack and that&rsquo;s how their whole friendship started, which she didn&rsquo;t understand at the time but then realized they&rsquo;re both good for each other.</p><p>So all in all, this is my fav scene because it established Tyrus as a real possibility but also we see TJ&rsquo;s soft side for the very first time and we see there&rsquo;s more to his character than what&rsquo;s on the surface and he&rsquo;s not a one-dimensional character like what the majority thought he&rsquo;d be.</p>",

Well, everyone except for Cyrus, of course.</p><p>&ldquo;Of\ncourse it was!&rdquo; Andi says, it seems that she\u2019s remembering a few scenes\nthat could justify her own fear and the fact that she will have nightmares\nduring a very long time.</p><p>&ldquo;It\nwas kinda scary, it&rsquo;s not the worst I&rsquo;ve seen,&rdquo; It seems that Jonah, as\nalways, will try to remain impartial in this situation. &ldquo;It was actually fun.&rdquo;\nAnd Cyrus thinks that <i>fun</i> is not the perfect word to describe that\nmovie. Horrible, disturbing, one of the scariest movies he ever saw, maybe that\nlast one.</p><p>When he looks\nat Buffy, he knows she\u2019s thinking something similar. She still looks scared,\nbut she doesn\u2019t want to show it. Even though she and TJ get along much better\nnow, for some reason that Cyrus can\u2019t understand, they keep competing like\ncrazy. And it is obvious that her friend will try not to show her fear to anyone,\neven if it is obvious in her face and in her sudden silence.</p><p>&ldquo;It\nscared me.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what Cyrus finally dares to comment on. The light of\nthe television bothers them in the face. Jonah gets up to turn on the light and\nreturns to his seat quickly, next to Andi.</p><p>&ldquo;I\nknow, Underdog,&rdquo; TJ says with a less malicious smile, a smile that would\nmake him melt, that makes him forget the movie and that they are accompanied.\n&ldquo;I had to hug you all the way through the movie.&rdquo; And although\ntelevision is now on the Netflix main page, everything announces that Friday&rsquo;s\nmovies are about to end; TJ still has his arm around Cyrus&rsquo; shoulders. And\nalthough Cyrus does not want to imagine a love story with his new best friend,\nit&rsquo;s inevitable. Especially considering that everyone in Jonah&rsquo;s house looks at\nthem as if they knew it, as if they wanted to tell them something, but none\ndares to say a thing.</p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo;\nJonah breaks the spell they were in with his voice &ldquo;should we watch\nsomething to erase that movie from our memories?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please&rdquo;\nIt&rsquo;s the first thing Buffy says after they finished watching the movie. Now,\nfear is replaced by shame and as much as TJ wants to say something to annoy\nher, he doesn\u2019t say anything. The smell of Cyrus&rsquo; hair, the heat he feels under\nhis arm and the security that comes with being like that, stopped him.</p><p>&ldquo;Phineas\nand Ferb?&rdquo; Jonah asks when he finally finds something not scary on TV.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d\nSays TJ with a smile, and everything, at least for Cyrus, feels perfect.</p><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><p>&ldquo;I can\u2019t\nbelieve I forgot how good this show is&rdquo; comments TJ at the moment the\ncredits of the last chapter begin; Jonah turns off the television right away.</p><p>&ldquo;Neither\ncan I,\u201d The calmness in Buffy&rsquo;s face and voice were even more noticeable than\nher fear, something truly incredible. &quot;I love Candace&rdquo; Cyrus thinks\nit&rsquo;s funny, because Buffy and Candace can be equally stubborn and competitive.\nBut he does not dare to say it.</p><p>&ldquo;I\nprefer Isabella.&rdquo; Cyrus is not surprised when Andi says that.</p><p>&ldquo;I\nprefer the two gay kids.&rdquo; Now, Cyrus is surprised.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;\nEveryone asks almost at the same time, but Cyrus&rsquo;s voice sounds a little\nlouder. And, although he knows that he is in fact gay, he has not dared to say\nit out loud. Andi and Buffy are still the only people who know, he\u2019s still\nafraid to tell Jonah and he has not even considered the idea of \u200b\u200btelling TJ,\nhe is afraid to risk losing his new best friend and the boy he likes. Although\nthe latter discovered it recently, if he is honest with himself.</p><p>But now,\nwith that comment, he feels that things may not be so lost. And maybe, at least\nTJ will still be his friend if he decides to tell him.</p><p>&ldquo;What\nare you talking about TJ?&rdquo; Andi is the first one who dares to ask;\neveryone could see how TJ enjoyed seeing their faces full of surprise.</p><p>&ldquo;We\nall know that Baljeet and Buford are gay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re\nnot gay.&rdquo; Buffy says with her typical gesture of disbelief and for some\nreason, that makes Cyrus feel hurt.</p><p>&ldquo;Of\ncourse they are!&rdquo; TJ does not erase the smile on his face and Cyrus thinks\nthat TJ wanted to discuss this since they started watching the show. &ldquo;Were\nyou watching the same show as me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did\nyou see the same show as us?&rdquo; Andi sounds so incredulous at the boy&rsquo;s\nwords. Jonah and Cyrus look at each other for no more than ten seconds,\nmentally, they promise that none will participate in the discussion.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\npretty obvious they like each other!&rdquo; At that moment TJ stopped hugging\nhim and a feeling of slight insecurity pricked him on the back of his neck, he\ntried to hide it with a smile as he watched TJ settled down better on the sofa,\nas if he was preparing himself for discussion.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,\nno. They are frenemies.&rdquo; Buffy comments as if it were the most obvious\nthing in the world.</p><p>&ldquo;They\nliterally sang that they had a hole in their hearts because they were not\ntogether!&rdquo; This time, Andi and Buffy seem to have an answer and by the\nexpression on their face, they seem to be rethinking the song. And, if Cyrus is\nsincere, he also thought that song seemed to be between two boys in love with a\nbroken heart. &ldquo;And I know that the show presents them as frenemies but\n&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But?&rdquo;\nJonah asks, he seems curious about TJ&rsquo;s ideas.</p><p>&ldquo;I\nmean, they are children. And sometimes, when you&rsquo;re young, you do not really\nknow how to handle your feelings.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really\nTJ? Are you going to use the <i>he bothers you because he likes you</i>?\u201d Now\nBuffy sounds annoyed.</p><p>&quot;It&rsquo;s\nnot that!&rdquo; TJ sounds somewhat annoyed, too. &ldquo;Is that when &hellip;&rdquo;\nHe thinks about it for a few seconds and looks at Cyrus all that time.\n&ldquo;You know what? It does not even matter. You wouldn\u2019t even understand.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t\neven understand? Look, TJ\u2026\u201d Starts Buffy, but someone interrupts her.</p><p>&ldquo;I\nthought your favorite characters were Baljeet and Buford because they remind\nyou of Cyrus and yourself&rdquo; Those words come from Jonah&rsquo;s mouth and Cyrus\ncan feel that blush appear on his body, he turns his head to look at the boy\nnext to him. TJ has his eyes closed and a smile that tries to disappear. But it\ndoesn\u2019t,</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,\nwell, maybe that also has something to do with it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;TJ,\nare you saying that &hellip;?&rdquo; Cyrus feels that his voice can\u2019t get out of his\nthroat correctly, he can\u2019t even finish the question.</p><p>&ldquo;That\nI like you? And that it has always been difficult for me to talk about my\nfeelings?\u201d TJ makes a pause for a long time, maybe thinking about his next\nwords, maybe waiting for Cyrus to say something, but he&rsquo;s still paralyzed. He\ncannot believe that this is really happening. &quot;That if I had met you some\nyears ago I would kinda bully you just to be able to talk to you? That if we\nwere apart, we would sing about a hole in our heart? Maybe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo;\nAndi says, between being moved and surprised by all the information that TJ has\njust said in such a short time.</p><p>&ldquo;Ok,\ngirls, I think we need to give them some time alone.&rdquo; Jonah stands up and\nguides the girls to the door.</p><p>&ldquo;But\nthis is your house, Jonah,&rdquo; Buffy says.</p><p>&ldquo;Also\nI want to know how this ends!&rdquo; Andi looks at Cyrus and gives him one of\nhis best smiles. He knows that Buffy is going to get really angry when she\nfinds out that Andi knew for a long time that he liked TJ.</p><p>&ldquo;C\u2019mon,&rdquo;\nJonah smiles, softened by the emotion of his girlfriend. And the three leave\nthe house.</p><p>&ldquo;You\nknow? I didn\u2019t expect that that would be the way I told you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?\nThat you like guys or that you like me?&rdquo; Cyrus still felt the strange\nsensation in the back of his neck and a new feeling in his stomach, one that he\ndid not expect to feel even in a very distant future.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,\nnone of those, actually,&rdquo; TJ seems to be quite calm. &ldquo;I figured I was\ngoing to tell you that I like guys at The Spoon. So, if you reacted badly, I\ncould escape fast. &rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Me?\nReact badly?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,\nin my mind that can\u2019t understand math that sounded a lot more than\nlogical.&rdquo; They laugh and a weight they did not know they had on their\nshoulders, in their whole body, is released. At the cost of exposed feelings\nthey have for each other.</p><p>&ldquo;And\n&hellip; How were you going to tell me you like me?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;\nTJ scratches the back of his neck, now he seems a little nervous and that smile\nthat Cyrus knows so much just proves it. &ldquo;I was thinking of buying a lot\nof chocolate muffins and write with them something like <i>I like you Cy. Date\nme, </i>It would be near the swings &hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wow&rdquo;\nThey hear Andi not far away and Jonah and Buffy telling her to calm down.</p><p>&ldquo;Cy?\nWhy not Underdog?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Those\nwould be too many muffins to buy, my budget would only allow me Cy&rdquo; And\nthe they laugh again, as if that suddenly happened in reality.

Well, everyone except for Cyrus, of course.</p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse it was!\u201d Andi says, it seems that she\u2019s remembering a few scenes\nthat could justify her own fear and the fact that she will have nightmares\nduring a very long time.</p><p>\u201cIt\nwas kinda scary, it\u2019s not the worst I\u2019ve seen,\u201d It seems that Jonah, as\nalways, will try to remain impartial in this situation. \u201cIt was actually fun.\u201d\nAnd Cyrus thinks that <i>fun</i> is not the perfect word to describe that\nmovie. Horrible, disturbing, one of the scariest movies he ever saw, maybe that\nlast one.</p><p>When he looks\nat Buffy, he knows she\u2019s thinking something similar. She still looks scared,\nbut she doesn\u2019t want to show it. Even though she and TJ get along much better\nnow, for some reason that Cyrus can\u2019t understand, they keep competing like\ncrazy. And it is obvious that her friend will try not to show her fear to anyone,\neven if it is obvious in her face and in her sudden silence.</p><p>\u201cIt\nscared me.\u201d That\u2019s what Cyrus finally dares to comment on. The light of\nthe television bothers them in the face. Jonah gets up to turn on the light and\nreturns to his seat quickly, next to Andi.</p><p>\u201cI\nknow, Underdog,\u201d TJ says with a less malicious smile, a smile that would\nmake him melt, that makes him forget the movie and that they are accompanied.\n\u201cI had to hug you all the way through the movie.\u201d And although\ntelevision is now on the Netflix main page, everything announces that Friday\u2019s\nmovies are about to end; TJ still has his arm around Cyrus\u2019 shoulders. And\nalthough Cyrus does not want to imagine a love story with his new best friend,\nit\u2019s inevitable. Especially considering that everyone in Jonah\u2019s house looks at\nthem as if they knew it, as if they wanted to tell them something, but none\ndares to say a thing.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d\nJonah breaks the spell they were in with his voice \u201cshould we watch\nsomething to erase that movie from our memories?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease\u201d\nIt\u2019s the first thing Buffy says after they finished watching the movie. Now,\nfear is replaced by shame and as much as TJ wants to say something to annoy\nher, he doesn\u2019t say anything. The smell of Cyrus\u2019 hair, the heat he feels under\nhis arm and the security that comes with being like that, stopped him.</p><p>\u201cPhineas\nand Ferb?\u201d Jonah asks when he finally finds something not scary on TV.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d\nSays TJ with a smile, and everything, at least for Cyrus, feels perfect.</p><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\nbelieve I forgot how good this show is\u201d comments TJ at the moment the\ncredits of the last chapter begin; Jonah turns off the television right away.</p><p>\u201cNeither\ncan I,\u201d The calmness in Buffy\u2019s face and voice were even more noticeable than\nher fear, something truly incredible. \"I love Candace\u201d Cyrus thinks\nit\u2019s funny, because Buffy and Candace can be equally stubborn and competitive.\nBut he does not dare to say it.</p><p>\u201cI\nprefer Isabella.\u201d Cyrus is not surprised when Andi says that.</p><p>\u201cI\nprefer the two gay kids.\u201d Now, Cyrus is surprised.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d\nEveryone asks almost at the same time, but Cyrus\u2019s voice sounds a little\nlouder. And, although he knows that he is in fact gay, he has not dared to say\nit out loud. Andi and Buffy are still the only people who know, he\u2019s still\nafraid to tell Jonah and he has not even considered the idea of \u200b\u200btelling TJ,\nhe is afraid to risk losing his new best friend and the boy he likes. Although\nthe latter discovered it recently, if he is honest with himself.</p><p>But now,\nwith that comment, he feels that things may not be so lost. And maybe, at least\nTJ will still be his friend if he decides to tell him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\nare you talking about TJ?\u201d Andi is the first one who dares to ask;\neveryone could see how TJ enjoyed seeing their faces full of surprise.</p><p>\u201cWe\nall know that Baljeet and Buford are gay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re\nnot gay.\u201d Buffy says with her typical gesture of disbelief and for some\nreason, that makes Cyrus feel hurt.</p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse they are!\u201d TJ does not erase the smile on his face and Cyrus thinks\nthat TJ wanted to discuss this since they started watching the show. \u201cWere\nyou watching the same show as me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid\nyou see the same show as us?\u201d Andi sounds so incredulous at the boy\u2019s\nwords. Jonah and Cyrus look at each other for no more than ten seconds,\nmentally, they promise that none will participate in the discussion.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\npretty obvious they like each other!\u201d At that moment TJ stopped hugging\nhim and a feeling of slight insecurity pricked him on the back of his neck, he\ntried to hide it with a smile as he watched TJ settled down better on the sofa,\nas if he was preparing himself for discussion.</p><p>\u201cWell,\nno. They are frenemies.\u201d Buffy comments as if it were the most obvious\nthing in the world.</p><p>\u201cThey\nliterally sang that they had a hole in their hearts because they were not\ntogether!\u201d This time, Andi and Buffy seem to have an answer and by the\nexpression on their face, they seem to be rethinking the song. And, if Cyrus is\nsincere, he also thought that song seemed to be between two boys in love with a\nbroken heart. \u201cAnd I know that the show presents them as frenemies but\n\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d\nJonah asks, he seems curious about TJ\u2019s ideas.</p><p>\u201cI\nmean, they are children. And sometimes, when you\u2019re young, you do not really\nknow how to handle your feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally\nTJ? Are you going to use the <i>he bothers you because he likes you</i>?\u201d Now\nBuffy sounds annoyed.</p><p>\"It\u2019s\nnot that!\u201d TJ sounds somewhat annoyed, too. \u201cIs that when \u2026\u201d\nHe thinks about it for a few seconds and looks at Cyrus all that time.\n\u201cYou know what? It does not even matter. You wouldn\u2019t even understand.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t\neven understand? Look, TJ\u2026\u201d Starts Buffy, but someone interrupts her.</p><p>\u201cI\nthought your favorite characters were Baljeet and Buford because they remind\nyou of Cyrus and yourself\u201d Those words come from Jonah\u2019s mouth and Cyrus\ncan feel that blush appear on his body, he turns his head to look at the boy\nnext to him. TJ has his eyes closed and a smile that tries to disappear. But it\ndoesn\u2019t,</p><p>\u201cYeah,\nwell, maybe that also has something to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTJ,\nare you saying that \u2026?\u201d Cyrus feels that his voice can\u2019t get out of his\nthroat correctly, he can\u2019t even finish the question.</p><p>\u201cThat\nI like you? And that it has always been difficult for me to talk about my\nfeelings?\u201d TJ makes a pause for a long time, maybe thinking about his next\nwords, maybe waiting for Cyrus to say something, but he\u2019s still paralyzed. He\ncannot believe that this is really happening. \"That if I had met you some\nyears ago I would kinda bully you just to be able to talk to you? That if we\nwere apart, we would sing about a hole in our heart? Maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d\nAndi says, between being moved and surprised by all the information that TJ has\njust said in such a short time.</p><p>\u201cOk,\ngirls, I think we need to give them some time alone.\u201d Jonah stands up and\nguides the girls to the door.</p><p>\u201cBut\nthis is your house, Jonah,\u201d Buffy says.</p><p>\u201cAlso\nI want to know how this ends!\u201d Andi looks at Cyrus and gives him one of\nhis best smiles. He knows that Buffy is going to get really angry when she\nfinds out that Andi knew for a long time that he liked TJ.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d\nJonah smiles, softened by the emotion of his girlfriend. And the three leave\nthe house.</p><p>\u201cYou\nknow? I didn\u2019t expect that that would be the way I told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\nThat you like guys or that you like me?\u201d Cyrus still felt the strange\nsensation in the back of his neck and a new feeling in his stomach, one that he\ndid not expect to feel even in a very distant future.</p><p>\u201cWell,\nnone of those, actually,\u201d TJ seems to be quite calm. \u201cI figured I was\ngoing to tell you that I like guys at The Spoon. So, if you reacted badly, I\ncould escape fast. \u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\nReact badly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\nin my mind that can\u2019t understand math that sounded a lot more than\nlogical.\u201d They laugh and a weight they did not know they had on their\nshoulders, in their whole body, is released. At the cost of exposed feelings\nthey have for each other.</p><p>\u201cAnd\n\u2026 How were you going to tell me you like me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d\nTJ scratches the back of his neck, now he seems a little nervous and that smile\nthat Cyrus knows so much just proves it. \u201cI was thinking of buying a lot\nof chocolate muffins and write with them something like <i>I like you Cy. Date\nme, </i>It would be near the swings \u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow\u201d\nThey hear Andi not far away and Jonah and Buffy telling her to calm down.</p><p>\u201cCy?\nWhy not Underdog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose\nwould be too many muffins to buy, my budget would only allow me Cy\u201d And\nthe they laugh again, as if that suddenly happened in reality. As if one\nafternoon of summer TJ invites him out almost at nightfall and when he got to\nthe swings there were the muffins and TJ with a smile just for him.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d\nCyrus can feel a new security atmosphere and can see in TJ\u2019s face that he also\nfeels it. \u201cWould you like to go on a date with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d\nHe answers, maybe too fast. But it seems that neither of them really cares.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow\nwe can walk around the city and then eat at The Spoon.\u201d TJ moves closer to\ntheir faces and Cyrus thinks he knows what\u2019s going to happen, but he does not\nwant to make a mistake.</p><p>\u201cAre\nyou going to\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss\nyou? Only if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse I do.\u201d He answers, again way too fast for his liking, but seeing\nTJ\u2019s equally anxious face makes him feel a little better.</p><p>And then,\nit happens.</p><p>And it does\nnot look like anything he ever imagined or felt.

I didn\u2019t expect that that would be the way I told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\nThat you like guys or that you like me?\u201d Cyrus still felt the strange\nsensation in the back of his neck and a new feeling in his stomach, one that he\ndid not expect to feel even in a very distant future.</p><p>\u201cWell,\nnone of those, actually,\u201d TJ seems to be quite calm. \u201cI figured I was\ngoing to tell you that I like guys at The Spoon. So, if you reacted badly, I\ncould escape fast. \u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\nReact badly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\nin my mind that can\u2019t understand math that sounded a lot more than\nlogical.\u201d They laugh and a weight they did not know they had on their\nshoulders, in their whole body, is released. At the cost of exposed feelings\nthey have for each other.</p><p>\u201cAnd\n\u2026 How were you going to tell me you like me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d\nTJ scratches the back of his neck, now he seems a little nervous and that smile\nthat Cyrus knows so much just proves it. \u201cI was thinking of buying a lot\nof chocolate muffins and write with them something like <i>I like you Cy. Date\nme, </i>It would be near the swings \u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow\u201d\nThey hear Andi not far away and Jonah and Buffy telling her to calm down.</p><p>\u201cCy?\nWhy not Underdog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose\nwould be too many muffins to buy, my budget would only allow me Cy\u201d And\nthe they laugh again, as if that suddenly happened in reality. As if one\nafternoon of summer TJ invites him out almost at nightfall and when he got to\nthe swings there were the muffins and TJ with a smile just for him.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d\nCyrus can feel a new security atmosphere and can see in TJ\u2019s face that he also\nfeels it. \u201cWould you like to go on a date with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d\nHe answers, maybe too fast. But it seems that neither of them really cares.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow\nwe can walk around the city and then eat at The Spoon.\u201d TJ moves closer to\ntheir faces and Cyrus thinks he knows what\u2019s going to happen, but he does not\nwant to make a mistake.</p><p>\u201cAre\nyou going to\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss\nyou? Only if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse I do.\u201d He answers, again way too fast for his liking, but seeing\nTJ\u2019s equally anxious face makes him feel a little better.</p><p>And then,\nit happens.</p><p>And it does\nnot look like anything he ever imagined or felt. It is much, much better. When\nhe opens his eyes and sees TJ\u2019s smile, he knows he thinks the same. And for a\nfleeting moment, everything is more than perfect.</p><p>(So, this is my first fic that\u2019s not from Tyrus Week/Month Yay! I\u2019m kind of working in a Tyrus long-fic, but I\u2019m no really sure about anything right know lol)</p><p>Anyway , thanks for reading :D<br><br></p>",
                "content": "<p>A03:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16248323\">https://archiveofourown.org/works/16248323</a></p><p>&ldquo;That\nmovie was not even scary&rdquo; The smile that TJ has on his face seems to start\nto annoy everyone. Well, everyone except for Cyrus, of course.</p><p>&ldquo;Of\ncourse it was!&rdquo; Andi says, it seems that she&rsquo;s remembering a few scenes\nthat could justify her own fear and the fact that she will have nightmares\nduring a very long time.</p><p>&ldquo;It\nwas kinda scary, it&rsquo;s not the worst I&rsquo;ve seen,&rdquo; It seems that Jonah, as\nalways, will try to remain impartial in this situation. &ldquo;It was actually fun.&rdquo;\nAnd Cyrus thinks that <i>fun</i> is not the perfect word to describe that\nmovie. Horrible, disturbing, one of the scariest movies he ever saw, maybe that\nlast one.</p><p>When he looks\nat Buffy, he knows she&rsquo;s thinking something similar. She still looks scared,\nbut she doesn&rsquo;t want to show it. Even though she and TJ get along much better\nnow, for some reason that Cyrus can&rsquo;t understand, they keep competing like\ncrazy. And it is obvious that her friend will try not to show her fear to anyone,\neven if it is obvious in her face and in her sudden silence.</p><p>&ldquo;It\nscared me.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what Cyrus finally dares to comment on. The light of\nthe television bothers them in the face. Jonah gets up to turn on the light and\nreturns to his seat quickly, next to Andi.</p><p>&ldquo;I\nknow, Underdog,&rdquo; TJ says with a less malicious smile, a smile that would\nmake him melt, that makes him forget the movie and that they are accompanied.\n&ldquo;I had to hug you all the way through the movie.&rdquo; And although\ntelevision is now on the Netflix main page, everything announces that Friday&rsquo;s\nmovies are about to end; TJ still has his arm around Cyrus&rsquo; shoulders. And\nalthough Cyrus does not want to imagine a love story with his new best friend,\nit&rsquo;s inevitable. Especially considering that everyone in Jonah&rsquo;s house looks at\nthem as if they knew it, as if they wanted to tell them something, but none\ndares to say a thing.</p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo;\nJonah breaks the spell they were in with his voice &ldquo;should we watch\nsomething to erase that movie from our memories?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please&rdquo;\nIt&rsquo;s the first thing Buffy says after they finished watching the movie. Now,\nfear is replaced by shame and as much as TJ wants to say something to annoy\nher, he doesn&rsquo;t say anything. The smell of Cyrus&rsquo; hair, the heat he feels under\nhis arm and the security that comes with being like that, stopped him.</p><p>&ldquo;Phineas\nand Ferb?&rdquo; Jonah asks when he finally finds something not scary on TV.</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;\nSays TJ with a smile, and everything, at least for Cyrus, feels perfect.</p><p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t\nbelieve I forgot how good this show is&rdquo; comments TJ at the moment the\ncredits of the last chapter begin; Jonah turns off the television right away.</p><p>&ldquo;Neither\ncan I,&rdquo; The calmness in Buffy&rsquo;s face and voice were even more noticeable than\nher fear, something truly incredible. \"I love Candace&rdquo; Cyrus thinks\nit&rsquo;s funny, because Buffy and Candace can be equally stubborn and competitive.\nBut he does not dare to say it.</p><p>&ldquo;I\nprefer Isabella.&rdquo; Cyrus is not surprised when Andi says that.</p><p>&ldquo;I\nprefer the two gay kids.&rdquo; Now, Cyrus is surprised.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;\nEveryone asks almost at the same time, but Cyrus&rsquo;s voice sounds a little\nlouder. And, although he knows that he is in fact gay, he has not dared to say\nit out loud. Andi and Buffy are still the only people who know, he&rsquo;s still\nafraid to tell Jonah and he has not even considered the idea of &#8203;&#8203;telling TJ,\nhe is afraid to risk losing his new best friend and the boy he likes. Although\nthe latter discovered it recently, if he is honest with himself.</p><p>But now,\nwith that comment, he feels that things may not be so lost. And maybe, at least\nTJ will still be his friend if he decides to tell him.</p><p>&ldquo;What\nare you talking about TJ?&rdquo; Andi is the first one who dares to ask;\neveryone could see how TJ enjoyed seeing their faces full of surprise.</p><p>&ldquo;We\nall know that Baljeet and Buford are gay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re\nnot gay.&rdquo; Buffy says with her typical gesture of disbelief and for some\nreason, that makes Cyrus feel hurt.</p><p>&ldquo;Of\ncourse they are!&rdquo; TJ does not erase the smile on his face and Cyrus thinks\nthat TJ wanted to discuss this since they started watching the show. &ldquo;Were\nyou watching the same show as me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did\nyou see the same show as us?&rdquo; Andi sounds so incredulous at the boy&rsquo;s\nwords. Jonah and Cyrus look at each other for no more than ten seconds,\nmentally, they promise that none will participate in the discussion.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\npretty obvious they like each other!&rdquo; At that moment TJ stopped hugging\nhim and a feeling of slight insecurity pricked him on the back of his neck, he\ntried to hide it with a smile as he watched TJ settled down better on the sofa,\nas if he was preparing himself for discussion.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,\nno. They are frenemies.&rdquo; Buffy comments as if it were the most obvious\nthing in the world.</p><p>&ldquo;They\nliterally sang that they had a hole in their hearts because they were not\ntogether!&rdquo; This time, Andi and Buffy seem to have an answer and by the\nexpression on their face, they seem to be rethinking the song. And, if Cyrus is\nsincere, he also thought that song seemed to be between two boys in love with a\nbroken heart. &ldquo;And I know that the show presents them as frenemies but\n&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But?&rdquo;\nJonah asks, he seems curious about TJ&rsquo;s ideas.</p><p>&ldquo;I\nmean, they are children. And sometimes, when you&rsquo;re young, you do not really\nknow how to handle your feelings.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really\nTJ? Are you going to use the <i>he bothers you because he likes you</i>?&rdquo; Now\nBuffy sounds annoyed.</p><p>\"It&rsquo;s\nnot that!&rdquo; TJ sounds somewhat annoyed, too. &ldquo;Is that when &hellip;&rdquo;\nHe thinks about it for a few seconds and looks at Cyrus all that time.\n&ldquo;You know what? It does not even matter. You wouldn&rsquo;t even understand.&rdquo;\n</p><p>&ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t\neven understand? Look, TJ&hellip;&rdquo; Starts Buffy, but someone interrupts her.</p><p>&ldquo;I\nthought your favorite characters were Baljeet and Buford because they remind\nyou of Cyrus and yourself&rdquo; Those words come from Jonah&rsquo;s mouth and Cyrus\ncan feel that blush appear on his body, he turns his head to look at the boy\nnext to him. TJ has his eyes closed and a smile that tries to disappear. But it\ndoesn&rsquo;t,</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,\nwell, maybe that also has something to do with it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;TJ,\nare you saying that &hellip;?&rdquo; Cyrus feels that his voice can&rsquo;t get out of his\nthroat correctly, he can&rsquo;t even finish the question.</p><p>&ldquo;That\nI like you? And that it has always been difficult for me to talk about my\nfeelings?&rdquo; TJ makes a pause for a long time, maybe thinking about his next\nwords, maybe waiting for Cyrus to say something, but he&rsquo;s still paralyzed. He\ncannot believe that this is really happening. \"That if I had met you some\nyears ago I would kinda bully you just to be able to talk to you? That if we\nwere apart, we would sing about a hole in our heart? Maybe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo;\nAndi says, between being moved and surprised by all the information that TJ has\njust said in such a short time.</p><p>&ldquo;Ok,\ngirls, I think we need to give them some time alone.&rdquo; Jonah stands up and\nguides the girls to the door.</p><p>&ldquo;But\nthis is your house, Jonah,&rdquo; Buffy says.</p><p>&ldquo;Also\nI want to know how this ends!&rdquo; Andi looks at Cyrus and gives him one of\nhis best smiles. He knows that Buffy is going to get really angry when she\nfinds out that Andi knew for a long time that he liked TJ.</p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon,&rdquo;\nJonah smiles, softened by the emotion of his girlfriend. And the three leave\nthe house.</p><p>&ldquo;You\nknow? I didn&rsquo;t expect that that would be the way I told you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?\nThat you like guys or that you like me?&rdquo; Cyrus still felt the strange\nsensation in the back of his neck and a new feeling in his stomach, one that he\ndid not expect to feel even in a very distant future.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,\nnone of those, actually,&rdquo; TJ seems to be quite calm. &ldquo;I figured I was\ngoing to tell you that I like guys at The Spoon.
