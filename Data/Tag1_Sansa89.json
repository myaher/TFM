Like Minisa Tully, her mother&rsquo;s mother.</p><p>A name is a powerful reminiscence, a reminder for the future.</p><p>Merely newborn and already betrothed to her uncle Edmure&rsquo;s son, her marriage will gather under the same banner not two, but three great houses. Arryn, Tully, the bastards Frey. (But not the Stark.)</p><p>In the end something fierce, burning and corrosive more than hatred and pride, convinced her differently.</p><p>Her daughter is not a Tully. Her eyes are blue like lapis lazuli and her dark hair is as soft as the plumage of a small blackbird.</p><p>She is a strange combination of colors and traits, this silent daughter of hers. She never cries, and when she does she makes plaintive sounds that remind her the whines of her third husband on his deathbed. Sweetrobin died of a sudden fever and Sansa will not pretend it was a mournful moment.</p><p>Her daughter is blood of her blood.</p><p>She wanted a strong name for her. Not one with a sweet sound like hers, which was born during the summer, when the sun is warm and you do not know anything beyond the sugary taste of ripe fruit on the tongue. Her daughter is a winter child, when wolves howl in the heart of the storm and the cold night is so penetrating that it digs sores and scars into the skin.</p><p>So not Minisa.</p><p>Lyarra Arryn.</p><p>Lyarra as her father&rsquo;s mother.</p><p>Sansa doesn&rsquo;t know much about her. Mourning made her father taciturn and talking about the family lost during the Rebellion has always been difficult enough to convince all his children to desist from asking questions. All of them except Arya of course. Sansa has always been too sensitive to the pain in her father&rsquo;s eyes. A pain that now understands, that cannot be fought, but only accepted.</p><p>What little she knows of her grandmother, she has learned from Old Nan&rsquo;s tales. She knows she was beautiful, the same beauty that cursed her aunt Lyanna, capable of triggering desire in men as the most insidious of fires, but less refined and more ferocious, that there was a quiet dignity in her that made her regal and haughty and stubborn.</p><p>And this is the kind of woman that Sansa wants her daughter to become. Not a woman with easy smiles and close, caring and kindly affections, a woman who died during childbirth. But a woman who knows the pain of loss and learned to face it, to live with it. A woman capable of feeling compassion and putting fear and honor before silly songs and frivolous puerilities.</p><p>*</p><p>When Jon is led in front of her, from the elevated position she occupies on the throne made of weirwood, Sansa observes him.</p><p>More than a year and a half has passed since the last time she saw him.</p><p>Gloomy, stern, imposing despite the average height.</p><p>Yet something is different. His stiff and secure posture, the manner in which the guards who escorted him are kept at a distance and the ambiguous impression it creates in anyone observing the scene: that they are not there to restrain him as a prisoner, but to serve him as their lord.</p><p>(He arrived on the back of a dragon and after depositing him on one of the balconies of the maiden&rsquo;s tower and alerting the entire castle, the green monster flew away with the same speed with had arrived.)</p><p>Jon has always had the ability to inspire loyalty in the people around him. But now his presence instills fear and puts in awe. Here the difference. He is no longer a warrior or a lord commander. He is a king.</p><p>A crownless king who has renounced the title, she remembers with bitterness.</p><p>The lords around her are restless like horses on the stone seats due to the prolonged silence. Sansa doesn&rsquo;t care. She keeps watching the man who was her brother. Who is her cousin, according to the missive that a raven brought from South a week ago. Who now looks at her with the same intense eyes as ever in the solemn face of Ned Stark. With his hand clasped around the pommel of the sword hanging from his hip and a calm expression, as if they have all the time of time.</p><p>Sansa knows exactly how she must appear. Austere. Tough. Restrained. She wears the colors of the Arryn, blue and white, and at her neck has the heavy pendant with the silver falcon that was Sweetrobin&rsquo;s wedding present.</p><p>Standing on her right is her daughter&rsquo;s nurse and Lyarra, in Mya Stone\u2019s arms, is a tiny bundle hidden by too many blankets.</p><p>One minute, two minutes. When Lyarra&rsquo;s whimpering wails breaks into the High Hall, noisy like a thunder, without turning she strains her arms imperiously. The nurse hands to Sansa her daughter. Her face is already purple and those wiggles that seem a cheeping. Despite the excruciating tenderness she feels, it is sometimes difficult to find differences between her and Robin.</p><p>With a sure hand, she loosens the laces of the bodice. As soon as she approaches her breasts, Lyarra starts sucking greedily, hungry like a kitten.</p><p>The nervousness of the lords seems to increase exponentially along with their murmurs. Sansa can easily guess why.</p><p>Once her aunt Lysa offered a similar sight. And her cousin grew up to become the result of that paranoid, possessive, deviant love.</p><p>I'm\u00a0not my aunt.</p><p>She cannot trust anyone and the peace she has achieved in the Vale is as fragile as a dream. Lyarra is too young, delicate and small as a doll. Children die all the time. And despite this, she is her only hope.</p><p>Look ahead. Fly high.</p><p>&ldquo;Jon Snow,&rdquo; her voice echoes loud and clear between the blue-veined marble walls and the high ceilings. &ldquo;You are in the presence of the Defender of the Vale and her lords to be judged for your actions. You have brought yourself into my house like a thief, terrorizing my servants with the threat of your dragon. Without invitation. Without a raven or an herald to announce your arrival. How do you intend to answer these accusations?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know I was under accusation.&rdquo;</p><p>While some lords stand up in protest for that insolent response, Sansa simply smiles. It is a calculating smile, without warmth or affection because she left her heart in Winterfell, in the Hall where Arya slaughtered Littlefinger, deciding her destiny, sanctioning her final exile from the home of her ancestors.</p><p>&ldquo;You are not,&rdquo; she says, bitter as gall and with a tone of voice that suggests the opposite. &ldquo;But tell me, please, if you had found one of my men in your private rooms, what punishment would you have reserved to him? The North is known for its indulgence. Would you have been compassionate then, as I am while I am questioning you or would you have killed him on the spot, piercing him with your sword? Answer, my lord. I am here to listen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sansa.&rdquo; Emotion makes his voice hoarse. For the first time, he seems in conflict and all his arrogance has disappeared. Has he finally realized that he is at a disadvantage, of the danger looming over him like an ambush? &ldquo;You know why I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa raises her eyebrows, feigning curiosity and surprise. &ldquo;Do I?&rdquo;</p><p>He nods, a military gesture. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to save you.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa bursts out laughing. She cannot avoid it. Nearly two years and Jon still believes he can protect her. Two years and he holds her gaze without shame, ready to repeat to the bitter end his promises filled with good intentions.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s what else has changed. First it was the fear of being hurt for the umpteenth time to make her cautious, to keep her from trusting him. Now it is grudge and experience that push her to laugh at him. The events proved that she was right and he wrong. Never again she will leave a man ratiocination or his low instincts to decide her destiny.</p><p>&ldquo;Save me?&rdquo; Sansa repeats slowly and if she didn&rsquo;t have Lyarra attached to her breast she would lean forward. Laughter scratched her throat like a fishbone swallowed by mistake. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re wrong or misinformed, cousin. Where I am is where I want to be. If I&rsquo;m here it&rsquo;s for my own will. The Eyrie is the house I&rsquo;ve chosen, the house of my deceased&rsquo;s husband, of our daughter.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon seems about to retaliate. Sansa doesn&rsquo;t allow it. She has had enough. Of him, of his frowning face, of his steady gaze that seems to expose her and search, search,\u00a0search.</p><p>With a nod, Sansa lets Lord Royce understand that she intends to dissolve the session. When Sansa gets up from the throne and returns Lyarra to the care of the nurse, the lords and the ladies also get up, showing the respect that is due to her as regent and Lady Protector of the Vale. These men and women of the Vale are proud people, made of a hard temper, almost as hard as that of the northerners. Even if they have doubts about her, they would never show them in front of a stranger and his false pretensions of friendship.</p><p>She is at the end of the stairs and is heading for the arches of the corridor that leads to her apartments when she hears the sound of a scuffle and Jon&rsquo;s voice - even before his hot hand on the elbow - stops her steps. She turns her head and he is there, incredibly close, enough to be inappropriate, enough that she feels the caress of his breath against her face. He has a sword pointed at his throat and one at his back, but he doesn&rsquo;t recede and doesn&rsquo;t let go of her arm. When he tilts dangerously forward, the tip of the blade scratches his neck and a trickle of blood escapes from the newly wound. And despite this, Jon doesn&rsquo;t look away from her, doesn&rsquo;t loosen his grip of steel.</p><p>&ldquo;I will not leave you here,&rdquo; he says in a low voice, low enough for the words to be audible to her alone. &ldquo;I came to take you home.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa squints. For a brief moment she is tempted to put a hand on his cheek and feel the heat abandon his skin as she lets the sword sink into his throat. This is the measure of her anger. This is the gauge of her hatred for having abandoned her. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if he&rsquo;s back. It&rsquo;s too late. Don&rsquo;t you see? Don&rsquo;t you feel it? I&rsquo;m lost. The darkness has already taken me. I am outside your reach. There is nothing left to save. He is back, yes, but a year too late.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fool, Jon Snow.&rdquo; She sees his eyes widen. Perhaps because of the coldness with she is staring at him and that now, at such a close distance, he cannot help but notice. Or maybe for her listless voice. &ldquo;I already told you once, don\u2019t you remember? No one can protect anyone.&rdquo; Sansa tightens her fingers around the blade pointed at Jon&rsquo;s throat. Dull to the pain that this causes, oblivious to the cuts she is getting, of her blood that now dribbles copiously along the edge of the blade.</p><p>Horror makes its way into Jon&rsquo;s striken-white face, mixed with rapture and astonishment and grief. A\u00a0wry look, something between amusement and regret. He looks at her as if he doesn&rsquo;t recognize her, as if the person he sees disconcerts him. He looks at her as if she is a stranger, and he is weeping the death of the sister he knew.</p><p>&ldquo;Go back to where you came from,&rdquo; she says, opening her fingers and letting the blood run down her fingers and palm. They are superficial wounds and Sansa remembers the lessons of Septa Mordane when she was nothing but a child, how much blood gushed from her fingertips even at the slightest accidental puncture of her needle. She takes a step back. &ldquo;You are not welcome here.&rdquo;</p><p>I can see it, it say the look in his eyes.</p><p>Jon sighs and shakes his head, as if he has came to terms with himself, made an unpleasant decision. &ldquo;I cannot, I promised your siblings that I would take you home.&rdquo;</p><p>Your siblings.</p><p>&ldquo;I am already home.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon doesn\u2019t wince and doesn\u2019t flinch, but he swallows and when he looks down, Sansa closes her hands into fists. Pain pierces her like fire and blurs her sight.</p><p>&ldquo;My lady,&rdquo; Lord Royce calls her. Sansa stares at him with a gaze clouded by tears of suffering. She blinks. &ldquo;My lady,&rdquo; he repeats with more kindness, but with the same urgency. &ldquo;Allow me to escort you to your rooms.&rdquo; And turned to the guards: &ldquo;Take the prisoner to the cells.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Sansa rediscovers herself saying forcefully. Surprise flash in the faces of those present, except for that of Jon who remains mournful and pensive. She clenches her teeth and lifts her chin. &ldquo;Jon Snow is my guest and I wish for him to be treated like one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lady Sansa,&rdquo; Lord Royce intervenes, clearly dumbfounded by the turn of events, &ldquo;would you wish I remind you that this man sneaked into the castle from a balcony of the eastern tower?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t necessary since I exposed this fact a little while ago.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And despite this, you intend to treat him as a guest?&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa pierces him with a glare so cold that the man falls silent. &ldquo;I intend to treat him with the respect I owe to a relative of mine, that I owe him as a son of King and the nephew of a Queen, or perhaps will you explain to Daenerys Targaryen why her heir was locked up in a cell and held prisoner?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Obviously you&rsquo;re right. I beg your pardon, my Lady.&rdquo; With a wave of his hand, he orders the guards to let him go.</p><p>The guards lower their weapons and Jon straightens his back. Without waiting to see him move as they lead him away, she turns and starts walking again.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to give up on you.&rdquo; Just like her when she spoke from the throne, his voice resounds stentorian and impossible to ignore. Sansa knows that it is for the point in the hall where he is, that\u2019s the way in which it was designed and built (the circular-shaped plant, surrounded by arches and a domed ceiling) to give the impression that Jon&rsquo;s words reverberate from anywhere, as if repeating them were an infinity versions of him, young and old ones, from different points scattered in their lives, past and present and future, to mingle in an inseparable amalgam. &ldquo;I will not leave, not without you.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa doesn\u2019t retrace her steps, she doesn\u2019t slow down. Her ears buzz and she feels hot and cold at the same time. Mya glances at her furtively and Lord Royce&rsquo;s jaw is tight.</p>",

Like Minisa Tully, her mother\u2019s mother.</p><p>A name is a powerful reminiscence, a reminder for the future.</p><p>Merely newborn and already betrothed to her uncle Edmure\u2019s son, her marriage will gather under the same banner not two, but three great houses. Arryn, Tully, the bastards Frey. (But not the Stark.)</p><p>In the end something fierce, burning and corrosive more than hatred and pride, convinced her differently.</p><p>Her daughter is not a Tully. Her eyes are blue like lapis lazuli and her dark hair is as soft as the plumage of a small blackbird.</p><p>She is a strange combination of colors and traits, this silent daughter of hers. She never cries, and when she does she makes plaintive sounds that remind her the whines of her third husband on his deathbed. Sweetrobin died of a sudden fever and Sansa will not pretend it was a mournful moment.</p><p>Her daughter is blood of her blood.</p><p>She wanted a strong name for her. Not one with a sweet sound like hers, which was born during the summer, when the sun is warm and you do not know anything beyond the sugary taste of ripe fruit on the tongue. Her daughter is a winter child, when wolves howl in the heart of the storm and the cold night is so penetrating that it digs sores and scars into the skin.</p><p>So not Minisa.</p><p>Lyarra Arryn.</p><p>Lyarra as her father\u2019s mother.</p><p>Sansa doesn\u2019t know much about her. Mourning made her father taciturn and talking about the family lost during the Rebellion has always been difficult enough to convince all his children to desist from asking questions. All of them except Arya of course. Sansa has always been too sensitive to the pain in her father\u2019s eyes. A pain that now understands, that cannot be fought, but only accepted.</p><p>What little she knows of her grandmother, she has learned from Old Nan\u2019s tales. She knows she was beautiful, the same beauty that cursed her aunt Lyanna, capable of triggering desire in men as the most insidious of fires, but less refined and more ferocious, that there was a quiet dignity in her that made her regal and haughty and stubborn.</p><p>And this is the kind of woman that Sansa wants her daughter to become. Not a woman with easy smiles and close, caring and kindly affections, a woman who died during childbirth. But a woman who knows the pain of loss and learned to face it, to live with it. A woman capable of feeling compassion and putting fear and honor before silly songs and frivolous puerilities.</p><p>*</p><p>When Jon is led in front of her, from the elevated position she occupies on the throne made of weirwood, Sansa observes him.</p><p>More than a year and a half has passed since the last time she saw him.</p><p>Gloomy, stern, imposing despite the average height.</p><p>Yet something is different. His stiff and secure posture, the manner in which the guards who escorted him are kept at a distance and the ambiguous impression it creates in anyone observing the scene: that they are not there to restrain him as a prisoner, but to serve him as their lord.</p><p>(He arrived on the back of a dragon and after depositing him on one of the balconies of the maiden\u2019s tower and alerting the entire castle, the green monster flew away with the same speed with had arrived.)</p><p>Jon has always had the ability to inspire loyalty in the people around him. But now his presence instills fear and puts in awe. Here the difference. He is no longer a warrior or a lord commander. He is a king.</p><p>A crownless king who has renounced the title, she remembers with bitterness.</p><p>The lords around her are restless like horses on the stone seats due to the prolonged silence. Sansa doesn\u2019t care. She keeps watching the man who was her brother. Who is her cousin, according to the missive that a raven brought from South a week ago. Who now looks at her with the same intense eyes as ever in the solemn face of Ned Stark. With his hand clasped around the pommel of the sword hanging from his hip and a calm expression, as if they have all the time of time.</p><p>Sansa knows exactly how she must appear. Austere. Tough. Restrained. She wears the colors of the Arryn, blue and white, and at her neck has the heavy pendant with the silver falcon that was Sweetrobin\u2019s wedding present.</p><p>Standing on her right is her daughter\u2019s nurse and Lyarra, in Mya Stone\u2019s arms, is a tiny bundle hidden by too many blankets.</p><p>One minute, two minutes. When Lyarra\u2019s whimpering wails breaks into the High Hall, noisy like a thunder, without turning she strains her arms imperiously. The nurse hands to Sansa her daughter. Her face is already purple and those wiggles that seem a cheeping. Despite the excruciating tenderness she feels, it is sometimes difficult to find differences between her and Robin.</p><p>With a sure hand, she loosens the laces of the bodice. As soon as she approaches her breasts, Lyarra starts sucking greedily, hungry like a kitten.</p><p>The nervousness of the lords seems to increase exponentially along with their murmurs. Sansa can easily guess why.</p><p>Once her aunt Lysa offered a similar sight. And her cousin grew up to become the result of that paranoid, possessive, deviant love.</p><p>I'm\u00a0not my aunt.</p><p>She cannot trust anyone and the peace she has achieved in the Vale is as fragile as a dream. Lyarra is too young, delicate and small as a doll. Children die all the time. And despite this, she is her only hope.</p><p>Look ahead. Fly high.</p><p>\u201cJon Snow,\u201d her voice echoes loud and clear between the blue-veined marble walls and the high ceilings. \u201cYou are in the presence of the Defender of the Vale and her lords to be judged for your actions. You have brought yourself into my house like a thief, terrorizing my servants with the threat of your dragon. Without invitation. Without a raven or an herald to announce your arrival. How do you intend to answer these accusations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know I was under accusation.\u201d</p><p>While some lords stand up in protest for that insolent response, Sansa simply smiles. It is a calculating smile, without warmth or affection because she left her heart in Winterfell, in the Hall where Arya slaughtered Littlefinger, deciding her destiny, sanctioning her final exile from the home of her ancestors.</p><p>\u201cYou are not,\u201d she says, bitter as gall and with a tone of voice that suggests the opposite. \u201cBut tell me, please, if you had found one of my men in your private rooms, what punishment would you have reserved to him? The North is known for its indulgence. Would you have been compassionate then, as I am while I am questioning you or would you have killed him on the spot, piercing him with your sword? Answer, my lord. I am here to listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSansa.\u201d Emotion makes his voice hoarse. For the first time, he seems in conflict and all his arrogance has disappeared. Has he finally realized that he is at a disadvantage, of the danger looming over him like an ambush? \u201cYou know why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Sansa raises her eyebrows, feigning curiosity and surprise. \u201cDo I?\u201d</p><p>He nods, a military gesture. \u201cI\u2019m here to save you.\u201d</p><p>Sansa bursts out laughing. She cannot avoid it. Nearly two years and Jon still believes he can protect her. Two years and he holds her gaze without shame, ready to repeat to the bitter end his promises filled with good intentions.</p><p>Here\u2019s what else has changed. First it was the fear of being hurt for the umpteenth time to make her cautious, to keep her from trusting him. Now it is grudge and experience that push her to laugh at him. The events proved that she was right and he wrong. Never again she will leave a man ratiocination or his low instincts to decide her destiny.</p><p>\u201cSave me?\u201d Sansa repeats slowly and if she didn\u2019t have Lyarra attached to her breast she would lean forward. Laughter scratched her throat like a fishbone swallowed by mistake. \u201cI think you\u2019re wrong or misinformed, cousin. Where I am is where I want to be. If I\u2019m here it\u2019s for my own will. The Eyrie is the house I\u2019ve chosen, the house of my deceased\u2019s husband, of our daughter.\u201d</p><p>Jon seems about to retaliate. Sansa doesn\u2019t allow it. She has had enough. Of him, of his frowning face, of his steady gaze that seems to expose her and search, search,\u00a0search.</p><p>With a nod, Sansa lets Lord Royce understand that she intends to dissolve the session.

Like Minisa Tully, her mother\u2019s mother.</p><p>A name is a powerful reminiscence, a reminder for the future.</p><p>Merely newborn and already betrothed to her uncle Edmure\u2019s son, her marriage will gather under the same banner not two, but three great houses. Arryn, Tully, the bastards Frey. (But not the Stark.)</p><p>In the end something fierce, burning and corrosive more than hatred and pride, convinced her differently.</p><p>Her daughter is not a Tully. Her eyes are blue like lapis lazuli and her dark hair is as soft as the plumage of a small blackbird.</p><p>She is a strange combination of colors and traits, this silent daughter of hers. She never cries, and when she does she makes plaintive sounds that remind her the whines of her third husband on his deathbed. Sweetrobin died of a sudden fever and Sansa will not pretend it was a mournful moment.</p><p>Her daughter is blood of her blood.</p><p>She wanted a strong name for her. Not one with a sweet sound like hers, which was born during the summer, when the sun is warm and you do not know anything beyond the sugary taste of ripe fruit on the tongue. Her daughter is a winter child, when wolves howl in the heart of the storm and the cold night is so penetrating that it digs sores and scars into the skin.</p><p>So not Minisa.</p><p>Lyarra Arryn.</p><p>Lyarra as her father\u2019s mother.</p><p>Sansa doesn\u2019t know much about her. Mourning made her father taciturn and talking about the family lost during the Rebellion has always been difficult enough to convince all his children to desist from asking questions. All of them except Arya of course. Sansa has always been too sensitive to the pain in her father\u2019s eyes. A pain that now understands, that cannot be fought, but only accepted.</p><p>What little she knows of her grandmother, she has learned from Old Nan\u2019s tales. She knows she was beautiful, the same beauty that cursed her aunt Lyanna, capable of triggering desire in men as the most insidious of fires, but less refined and more ferocious, that there was a quiet dignity in her that made her regal and haughty and stubborn.</p><p>And this is the kind of woman that Sansa wants her daughter to become. Not a woman with easy smiles and close, caring and kindly affections, a woman who died during childbirth. But a woman who knows the pain of loss and learned to face it, to live with it. A woman capable of feeling compassion and putting fear and honor before silly songs and frivolous puerilities.</p><p>*</p><p>When Jon is led in front of her, from the elevated position she occupies on the throne made of weirwood, Sansa observes him.</p><p>More than a year and a half has passed since the last time she saw him.</p><p>Gloomy, stern, imposing despite the average height.</p><p>Yet something is different. His stiff and secure posture, the manner in which the guards who escorted him are kept at a distance and the ambiguous impression it creates in anyone observing the scene: that they are not there to restrain him as a prisoner, but to serve him as their lord.</p><p>(He arrived on the back of a dragon and after depositing him on one of the balconies of the maiden\u2019s tower and alerting the entire castle, the green monster flew away with the same speed with had arrived.)</p><p>Jon has always had the ability to inspire loyalty in the people around him. But now his presence instills fear and puts in awe. Here the difference. He is no longer a warrior or a lord commander. He is a king.</p><p>A crownless king who has renounced the title, she remembers with bitterness.</p><p>The lords around her are restless like horses on the stone seats due to the prolonged silence. Sansa doesn\u2019t care. She keeps watching the man who was her brother. Who is her cousin, according to the missive that a raven brought from South a week ago. Who now looks at her with the same intense eyes as ever in the solemn face of Ned Stark. With his hand clasped around the pommel of the sword hanging from his hip and a calm expression, as if they have all the time of time.</p><p>Sansa knows exactly how she must appear. Austere. Tough. Restrained. She wears the colors of the Arryn, blue and white, and at her neck has the heavy pendant with the silver falcon that was Sweetrobin\u2019s wedding present.</p><p>Standing on her right is her daughter\u2019s nurse and Lyarra, in Mya Stone\u2019s arms, is a tiny bundle hidden by too many blankets.</p><p>One minute, two minutes. When Lyarra\u2019s whimpering wails breaks into the High Hall, noisy like a thunder, without turning she strains her arms imperiously. The nurse hands to Sansa her daughter. Her face is already purple and those wiggles that seem a cheeping. Despite the excruciating tenderness she feels, it is sometimes difficult to find differences between her and Robin.</p><p>With a sure hand, she loosens the laces of the bodice. As soon as she approaches her breasts, Lyarra starts sucking greedily, hungry like a kitten.</p><p>The nervousness of the lords seems to increase exponentially along with their murmurs. Sansa can easily guess why.</p><p>Once her aunt Lysa offered a similar sight. And her cousin grew up to become the result of that paranoid, possessive, deviant love.</p><p>I'm\u00a0not my aunt.</p><p>She cannot trust anyone and the peace she has achieved in the Vale is as fragile as a dream. Lyarra is too young, delicate and small as a doll. Children die all the time. And despite this, she is her only hope.</p><p>Look ahead. Fly high.</p><p>\u201cJon Snow,\u201d her voice echoes loud and clear between the blue-veined marble walls and the high ceilings. \u201cYou are in the presence of the Defender of the Vale and her lords to be judged for your actions. You have brought yourself into my house like a thief, terrorizing my servants with the threat of your dragon. Without invitation. Without a raven or an herald to announce your arrival. How do you intend to answer these accusations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know I was under accusation.\u201d</p><p>While some lords stand up in protest for that insolent response, Sansa simply smiles. It is a calculating smile, without warmth or affection because she left her heart in Winterfell, in the Hall where Arya slaughtered Littlefinger, deciding her destiny, sanctioning her final exile from the home of her ancestors.</p><p>\u201cYou are not,\u201d she says, bitter as gall and with a tone of voice that suggests the opposite. \u201cBut tell me, please, if you had found one of my men in your private rooms, what punishment would you have reserved to him? The North is known for its indulgence. Would you have been compassionate then, as I am while I am questioning you or would you have killed him on the spot, piercing him with your sword? Answer, my lord. I am here to listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSansa.\u201d Emotion makes his voice hoarse. For the first time, he seems in conflict and all his arrogance has disappeared. Has he finally realized that he is at a disadvantage, of the danger looming over him like an ambush? \u201cYou know why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Sansa raises her eyebrows, feigning curiosity and surprise. \u201cDo I?\u201d</p><p>He nods, a military gesture. \u201cI\u2019m here to save you.\u201d</p><p>Sansa bursts out laughing. She cannot avoid it. Nearly two years and Jon still believes he can protect her. Two years and he holds her gaze without shame, ready to repeat to the bitter end his promises filled with good intentions.</p><p>Here\u2019s what else has changed. First it was the fear of being hurt for the umpteenth time to make her cautious, to keep her from trusting him. Now it is grudge and experience that push her to laugh at him. The events proved that she was right and he wrong. Never again she will leave a man ratiocination or his low instincts to decide her destiny.</p><p>\u201cSave me?\u201d Sansa repeats slowly and if she didn\u2019t have Lyarra attached to her breast she would lean forward. Laughter scratched her throat like a fishbone swallowed by mistake. \u201cI think you\u2019re wrong or misinformed, cousin. Where I am is where I want to be. If I\u2019m here it\u2019s for my own will. The Eyrie is the house I\u2019ve chosen, the house of my deceased\u2019s husband, of our daughter.\u201d</p><p>Jon seems about to retaliate. Sansa doesn\u2019t allow it. She has had enough. Of him, of his frowning face, of his steady gaze that seems to expose her and search, search,\u00a0search.</p><p>With a nod, Sansa lets Lord Royce understand that she intends to dissolve the session. When Sansa gets up from the throne and returns Lyarra to the care of the nurse, the lords and the ladies also get up, showing the respect that is due to her as regent and Lady Protector of the Vale. These men and women of the Vale are proud people, made of a hard temper, almost as hard as that of the northerners. Even if they have doubts about her, they would never show them in front of a stranger and his false pretensions of friendship.</p><p>She is at the end of the stairs and is heading for the arches of the corridor that leads to her apartments when she hears the sound of a scuffle and Jon\u2019s voice - even before his hot hand on the elbow - stops her steps. She turns her head and he is there, incredibly close, enough to be inappropriate, enough that she feels the caress of his breath against her face. He has a sword pointed at his throat and one at his back, but he doesn\u2019t recede and doesn\u2019t let go of her arm. When he tilts dangerously forward, the tip of the blade scratches his neck and a trickle of blood escapes from the newly wound. And despite this, Jon doesn\u2019t look away from her, doesn\u2019t loosen his grip of steel.</p><p>\u201cI will not leave you here,\u201d he says in a low voice, low enough for the words to be audible to her alone. \u201cI came to take you home.\u201d</p><p>Sansa squints. For a brief moment she is tempted to put a hand on his cheek and feel the heat abandon his skin as she lets the sword sink into his throat. This is the measure of her anger. This is the gauge of her hatred for having abandoned her. It doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s back. It\u2019s too late. Don\u2019t you see? Don\u2019t you feel it? I\u2019m lost. The darkness has already taken me. I am outside your reach. There is nothing left to save. He is back, yes, but a year too late.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fool, Jon Snow.\u201d She sees his eyes widen. Perhaps because of the coldness with she is staring at him and that now, at such a close distance, he cannot help but notice. Or maybe for her listless voice. \u201cI already told you once, don\u2019t you remember? No one can protect anyone.\u201d Sansa tightens her fingers around the blade pointed at Jon\u2019s throat. Dull to the pain that this causes, oblivious to the cuts she is getting, of her blood that now dribbles copiously along the edge of the blade.</p><p>Horror makes its way into Jon\u2019s striken-white face, mixed with rapture and astonishment and grief. A\u00a0wry look, something between amusement and regret. He looks at her as if he doesn\u2019t recognize her, as if the person he sees disconcerts him. He looks at her as if she is a stranger, and he is weeping the death of the sister he knew.</p><p>\u201cGo back to where you came from,\u201d she says, opening her fingers and letting the blood run down her fingers and palm. They are superficial wounds and Sansa remembers the lessons of Septa Mordane when she was nothing but a child, how much blood gushed from her fingertips even at the slightest accidental puncture of her needle. She takes a step back. \u201cYou are not welcome here.\u201d</p><p>I can see it, it say the look in his eyes.</p><p>Jon sighs and shakes his head, as if he has came to terms with himself, made an unpleasant decision. \u201cI cannot, I promised your siblings that I would take you home.\u201d</p><p>Your siblings.</p><p>\u201cI am already home.\u201d</p><p>Jon doesn\u2019t wince and doesn\u2019t flinch, but he swallows and when he looks down, Sansa closes her hands into fists. Pain pierces her like fire and blurs her sight.</p><p>\u201cMy lady,\u201d Lord Royce calls her. Sansa stares at him with a gaze clouded by tears of suffering. She blinks. \u201cMy lady,\u201d he repeats with more kindness, but with the same urgency. \u201cAllow me to escort you to your rooms.\u201d And turned to the guards: \u201cTake the prisoner to the cells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sansa rediscovers herself saying forcefully. Surprise flash in the faces of those present, except for that of Jon who remains mournful and pensive. She clenches her teeth and lifts her chin. \u201cJon Snow is my guest and I wish for him to be treated like one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Sansa,\u201d Lord Royce intervenes, clearly dumbfounded by the turn of events, \u201cwould you wish I remind you that this man sneaked into the castle from a balcony of the eastern tower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t necessary since I exposed this fact a little while ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd despite this, you intend to treat him as a guest?\u201d</p><p>Sansa pierces him with a glare so cold that the man falls silent. \u201cI intend to treat him with the respect I owe to a relative of mine, that I owe him as a son of King and the nephew of a Queen, or perhaps will you explain to Daenerys Targaryen why her heir was locked up in a cell and held prisoner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously you\u2019re right. I beg your pardon, my Lady.\u201d With a wave of his hand, he orders the guards to let him go.</p><p>The guards lower their weapons and Jon straightens his back. Without waiting to see him move as they lead him away, she turns and starts walking again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to give up on you.\u201d Just like her when she spoke from the throne, his voice resounds stentorian and impossible to ignore. Sansa knows that it is for the point in the hall where he is, that\u2019s the way in which it was designed and built (the circular-shaped plant, surrounded by arches and a domed ceiling) to give the impression that Jon\u2019s words reverberate from anywhere, as if repeating them were an infinity versions of him, young and old ones, from different points scattered in their lives, past and present and future, to mingle in an inseparable amalgam. \u201cI will not leave, not without you.\u201d</p><p>Sansa doesn\u2019t retrace her steps, she doesn\u2019t slow down. Her ears buzz and she feels hot and cold at the same time. Mya glances at her furtively and Lord Royce\u2019s jaw is tight.</p></p>",

Dull to the pain that this causes, oblivious to the cuts she is getting, of her blood that now dribbles copiously along the edge of the blade.</p><p>Horror makes its way into Jon&rsquo;s striken-white face, mixed with rapture and astonishment and grief. A&nbsp;wry look, something between amusement and regret. He looks at her as if he doesn&rsquo;t recognize her, as if the person he sees disconcerts him. He looks at her as if she is a stranger, and he is weeping the death of the sister he knew.</p><p>&ldquo;Go back to where you came from,&rdquo; she says, opening her fingers and letting the blood run down her fingers and palm. They are superficial wounds and Sansa remembers the lessons of Septa Mordane when she was nothing but a child, how much blood gushed from her fingertips even at the slightest accidental puncture of her needle. She takes a step back. &ldquo;You are not welcome here.&rdquo;</p><p>I can see it, it say the look in his eyes.</p><p>Jon sighs and shakes his head, as if he has came to terms with himself, made an unpleasant decision. &ldquo;I cannot, I promised your siblings that I would take you home.&rdquo;</p><p>Your siblings.</p><p>&ldquo;I am already home.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon doesn&rsquo;t wince and doesn&rsquo;t flinch, but he swallows and when he looks down, Sansa closes her hands into fists. Pain pierces her like fire and blurs her sight.</p><p>&ldquo;My lady,&rdquo; Lord Royce calls her. Sansa stares at him with a gaze clouded by tears of suffering. She blinks. &ldquo;My lady,&rdquo; he repeats with more kindness, but with the same urgency. &ldquo;Allow me to escort you to your rooms.&rdquo; And turned to the guards: &ldquo;Take the prisoner to the cells.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Sansa rediscovers herself saying forcefully. Surprise flash in the faces of those present, except for that of Jon who remains mournful and pensive. She clenches her teeth and lifts her chin. &ldquo;Jon Snow is my guest and I wish for him to be treated like one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lady Sansa,&rdquo; Lord Royce intervenes, clearly dumbfounded by the turn of events, &ldquo;would you wish I remind you that this man sneaked into the castle from a balcony of the eastern tower?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t necessary since I exposed this fact a little while ago.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And despite this, you intend to treat him as a guest?&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa pierces him with a glare so cold that the man falls silent. &ldquo;I intend to treat him with the respect I owe to a relative of mine, that I owe him as a son of King and the nephew of a Queen, or perhaps will you explain to Daenerys Targaryen why her heir was locked up in a cell and held prisoner?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Obviously you&rsquo;re right. I beg your pardon, my Lady.&rdquo; With a wave of his hand, he orders the guards to let him go.</p><p>The guards lower their weapons and Jon straightens his back. Without waiting to see him move as they lead him away, she turns and starts walking again.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to give up on you.&rdquo; Just like her when she spoke from the throne, his voice resounds stentorian and impossible to ignore. Sansa knows that it is for the point in the hall where he is, that&rsquo;s the way in which it was designed and built (the circular-shaped plant, surrounded by arches and a domed ceiling) to give the impression that Jon&rsquo;s words reverberate from anywhere, as if repeating them were an infinity versions of him, young and old ones, from different points scattered in their lives, past and present and future, to mingle in an inseparable amalgam. &ldquo;I will not leave, not without you.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa doesn&rsquo;t retrace her steps, she doesn&rsquo;t slow down. Her ears buzz and she feels hot and cold at the same time. Mya glances at her furtively and Lord Royce&rsquo;s jaw is tight.</p></p>",

She also gets out of the bed naked in front of Luwin after he arrives with the scroll. \u00a0When Ned comments that she is embarrassing the maester, she responds that he has birth all her children and so has seen everything she has to offer on multiple occasions.</p><p>After reading Lysa\u2019s note, Ned decides to accept Robert\u2019s request that he become the Hand of the King. \u00a0On the show, Cat is resistant to him going while in the books, she encourages him to do so. \u00a0In both instances, she is looking to protect her family. \u00a0And so Ned heads to Kings Landing with the king where he meets his death and his family\u2019s life is all but destroyed as a result. \u00a0As a callback, I think that we may get a similar scene this season involving a scroll but it won\u2019t be one that comes via a raven.</p><p>Many of us have speculated on the possibility of something of a romantic nature happening in the Lord\u2019s Chamber between Jon and Sansa. \u00a0For myself, I\u2019ve felt that it was a strong possibility since the writers made a point of letting the audience know that Jon had arranged for her to have the suite\u2026especially as it was done in the same scene that he gave her that longing forehead kiss. My theory is that once the truth about Jon\u2019s identity comes out, the emotional scene that David Nutter mentioned will occur between him and Sansa in the Lord\u2019s Chamber and it will lead to them making love.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe fans will not be let down,\u201d says director David Nutter. \u201cThere are a lot of firsts in these episodes. There\u2019s the funniest sequence I\u2019ve ever shot on this show, <b>the most emotional and compelling scene I\u2019ve ever shot</b>, and there\u2019s one scene where there\u2019s so many [major characters] together it feels like you\u2019re watching a superhero movie.\u201d-<b>David Nutter, Entertainment Weekly</b></p></blockquote><p>I think this for several reasons. \u00a0First, as I\u2019ve mentioned, with all the callbacks to the first episode, it makes sense that there is one of the scene between Ned and Cat in the Lord\u2019s Chamber as it was so important to the story. \u00a0Secondly, Sansa having a romantic encounter with a man who loves her for herself and not her inheritance has been part of her character arc in both on the show and in the books. \u00a0On the show, Petyr sold her to the Boltons and we all know what happened there. \u00a0Unfortunately, I don\u2019t rule out something similar happening in the Vale from either Petyr or Harry the Heir. \u00a0It maybe just an attempt but I definitely can see it happening. </p><p>Since she escaped from Ramsay\u2019s clutches on the show, Sansa has been understandably protecting herself both mentally and physically. \u00a0Part of this self-protection is reflected in how she dresses. \u00a0She is always covered from head to toe and she dresses in clothing that are difficult to take off. \u00a0Even her hands are not available for anyone to touch. \u00a0The only people who have been allowed to touch any part of her have been her family when she reunited with them. \u00a0These have included a few notable moments with Jon\u2014when she grabs his hand and most notably when he gave her the forehead kiss. \u00a0</p><p>A part of Sansa\u2019s arc has also been about learning to trust again and to allow a man in. \u00a0It is without a doubt not the only part of her arc and it is not even the most important. \u00a0Nevertheless, it is an aspect of her story and the likelihood of a romantic encounter between her and a man has been percolating throughout her arc. \u00a0The only question is with whom. \u00a0</p><p>Unlike what some think, it won\u2019t be with the Hound as in my opinion, his part in her story\u2026especially in the books will ultimately be shown to be about Jon or at least Jon as he will be upon his return. \u00a0The Hound\u2019s savage nature reflects what Jon will be like when he returns from the dead after his consciousness spends some time in Ghost. \u00a0I think it\u2019s why Martin gave him a moniker reminiscent of a wolfhound. \u00a0And as Sansa tempered the Hound, she will temper Jon. \u00a0Plus, Sandor Clegane is old enough to be Sansa\u2019s father and relationships between older men and girls young enough to be their daughters are one that George\u2019s writings shows to be abhorrent and must end. </p><p>It also won\u2019t be Tyrion for too many reasons to list\u2026least of all being that Sansa would never join with a Lannister after what they did to her family. \u00a0Plus, that is not the story either George or D&amp;D have been writing. \u00a0And it most certainly won\u2019t be Gendry or Pod\u2026two men she doesn\u2019t know. \u00a0In my book, this only leaves Jon. \u00a0A romantic relationship between the two has been hinted at in both the books and show. \u00a0And as there are only 6 episodes left, it has to happen this season. \u00a0</p><p>We also need to remember that this is <i>Game of Thrones</i> that we are talking about and the writers like to throw sex at the audience. \u00a0 With war and almost certain death looming for most of our heroes, it\u2019s almost guaranteed that there will be at least one this year as well and I suspect it will be the most important one of the entire series. \u00a0Making love and connecting to another human being before going off to war is a popular trope in both literature and the visual medium. \u00a0When one knows that one is facing death, it forces you to deal and acknowledge what is most important. \u00a0</p><p>Another reason I think that there will be a romantic encounter between the two eldest remaining Starks in the Lord\u2019s Chamber is because since they reunited, D&amp;D has written them with the angst George described in his original outline for Jon and Arya. \u00a0And so it seems possible to me that based on D&amp;D\u2019s writing George quite likely switched things up with the sisters. \u00a0There are many great metas out there that breakdown the many book clues point to a potential romantic relationship between Jon and Sansa and so there is no need to delve into those them here again as this article is about the show.</p><p>The scene I propose will occur between Jon and Sansa may also explain why things were downplayed in the one between him and Dany. \u00a0I think the emotional baring of the soul by Jon\u2019s in regards to the truth about his heritage, the fact that he was killed by his men and an examination of his scars both of the physical and mental variety will take place between him and Sansa. \u00a0The examination of both their scars will be between them and I am of the opinion that this is the emotional scene David Nutter referenced in the EW interview.</p><p>If as I proposed there is a romantic encounter between Jon and Sansa that harkens back to the one between Ned and Cat from episode one, then I think that just as Luwin knocked on the door of the Lord\u2019s Chamber after N&amp;C made love, Sam will do the same with the younger Starks. \u00a0Like with Luwin, Sam will come bearing a scroll with bad news. \u00a0And I think that it will turn out to be this scroll that Sophie was referring to in her interview. \u00a0</p><p>However, unlike the one from Lysa, it won\u2019t arrive via a raven. \u00a0Nonetheless, just as the one from Lysa resulted in Ned, the Lord of the House heading south, I think that the one Sam bears will mean the same thing for Sansa, the current Lady of Winterfell as Jon sends her away for protection. \u00a0I also think that in Kings Landing, we will get to see a reenactment of the tale told by the common folks in the books of how she escaped from the Red Keep.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The dwarf&rsquo;s wife did the murder with him,&rdquo; swore an archer in Lord Rowan&rsquo;s livery. &ldquo;Afterward, she vanished from the hall in a puff of brimstone,<b> and a ghostly direwolf was seen prowling the Red Keep, blood dripping from his jaws.&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>A Storm of Swords - Jaime VII</b></p></blockquote><p>If the scroll that Sam bears does not arrive via a raven then the question becomes, where did it come from. \u00a0Well, as I\u2019ve speculated in other posts, I\u2019m of the opinion that it was unknowingly brought to Winterfell by Sam himself. \u00a0In fact, I suspect that it is the very same scroll that Sam is shown stealing in the scene below of when he left the Citadel. \u00a0You can find the specific theft at the 2:07 mark.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2F1ueJGz6c5g0\"><iframe width=\"540\"

She also gets out of the bed naked in front of Luwin after he arrives with the scroll. \u00a0When Ned comments that she is embarrassing the maester, she responds that he has birth all her children and so has seen everything she has to offer on multiple occasions.</p><p>After reading Lysa\u2019s note, Ned decides to accept Robert\u2019s request that he become the Hand of the King. \u00a0On the show, Cat is resistant to him going while in the books, she encourages him to do so. \u00a0In both instances, she is looking to protect her family. \u00a0And so Ned heads to Kings Landing with the king where he meets his death and his family\u2019s life is all but destroyed as a result. \u00a0As a callback, I think that we may get a similar scene this season involving a scroll but it won\u2019t be one that comes via a raven.</p><p>Many of us have speculated on the possibility of something of a romantic nature happening in the Lord\u2019s Chamber between Jon and Sansa. \u00a0For myself, I\u2019ve felt that it was a strong possibility since the writers made a point of letting the audience know that Jon had arranged for her to have the suite\u2026especially as it was done in the same scene that he gave her that longing forehead kiss. My theory is that once the truth about Jon\u2019s identity comes out, the emotional scene that David Nutter mentioned will occur between him and Sansa in the Lord\u2019s Chamber and it will lead to them making love.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe fans will not be let down,\u201d says director David Nutter. \u201cThere are a lot of firsts in these episodes. There\u2019s the funniest sequence I\u2019ve ever shot on this show, <b>the most emotional and compelling scene I\u2019ve ever shot</b>, and there\u2019s one scene where there\u2019s so many [major characters] together it feels like you\u2019re watching a superhero movie.\u201d-<b>David Nutter, Entertainment Weekly</b></p></blockquote><p>I think this for several reasons. \u00a0First, as I\u2019ve mentioned, with all the callbacks to the first episode, it makes sense that there is one of the scene between Ned and Cat in the Lord\u2019s Chamber as it was so important to the story. \u00a0Secondly, Sansa having a romantic encounter with a man who loves her for herself and not her inheritance has been part of her character arc in both on the show and in the books. \u00a0On the show, Petyr sold her to the Boltons and we all know what happened there. \u00a0Unfortunately, I don\u2019t rule out something similar happening in the Vale from either Petyr or Harry the Heir. \u00a0It maybe just an attempt but I definitely can see it happening. </p><p>Since she escaped from Ramsay\u2019s clutches on the show, Sansa has been understandably protecting herself both mentally and physically. \u00a0Part of this self-protection is reflected in how she dresses. \u00a0She is always covered from head to toe and she dresses in clothing that are difficult to take off. \u00a0Even her hands are not available for anyone to touch. \u00a0The only people who have been allowed to touch any part of her have been her family when she reunited with them. \u00a0These have included a few notable moments with Jon\u2014when she grabs his hand and most notably when he gave her the forehead kiss. \u00a0</p><p>A part of Sansa\u2019s arc has also been about learning to trust again and to allow a man in. \u00a0It is without a doubt not the only part of her arc and it is not even the most important. \u00a0Nevertheless, it is an aspect of her story and the likelihood of a romantic encounter between her and a man has been percolating throughout her arc. \u00a0The only question is with whom. \u00a0</p><p>Unlike what some think, it won\u2019t be with the Hound as in my opinion, his part in her story\u2026especially in the books will ultimately be shown to be about Jon or at least Jon as he will be upon his return. \u00a0The Hound\u2019s savage nature reflects what Jon will be like when he returns from the dead after his consciousness spends some time in Ghost. \u00a0I think it\u2019s why Martin gave him a moniker reminiscent of a wolfhound. \u00a0And as Sansa tempered the Hound, she will temper Jon. \u00a0Plus, Sandor Clegane is old enough to be Sansa\u2019s father and relationships between older men and girls young enough to be their daughters are one that George\u2019s writings shows to be abhorrent and must end. </p><p>It also won\u2019t be Tyrion for too many reasons to list\u2026least of all being that Sansa would never join with a Lannister after what they did to her family. \u00a0Plus, that is not the story either George or D&amp;D have been writing. \u00a0And it most certainly won\u2019t be Gendry or Pod\u2026two men she doesn\u2019t know. \u00a0In my book, this only leaves Jon. \u00a0A romantic relationship between the two has been hinted at in both the books and show. \u00a0And as there are only 6 episodes left, it has to happen this season. \u00a0</p><p>We also need to remember that this is <i>Game of Thrones</i> that we are talking about and the writers like to throw sex at the audience. \u00a0 With war and almost certain death looming for most of our heroes, it\u2019s almost guaranteed that there will be at least one this year as well and I suspect it will be the most important one of the entire series. \u00a0Making love and connecting to another human being before going off to war is a popular trope in both literature and the visual medium. \u00a0When one knows that one is facing death, it forces you to deal and acknowledge what is most important. \u00a0</p><p>Another reason I think that there will be a romantic encounter between the two eldest remaining Starks in the Lord\u2019s Chamber is because since they reunited, D&amp;D has written them with the angst George described in his original outline for Jon and Arya. \u00a0And so it seems possible to me that based on D&amp;D\u2019s writing George quite likely switched things up with the sisters. \u00a0There are many great metas out there that breakdown the many book clues point to a potential romantic relationship between Jon and Sansa and so there is no need to delve into those them here again as this article is about the show.</p><p>The scene I propose will occur between Jon and Sansa may also explain why things were downplayed in the one between him and Dany. \u00a0I think the emotional baring of the soul by Jon\u2019s in regards to the truth about his heritage, the fact that he was killed by his men and an examination of his scars both of the physical and mental variety will take place between him and Sansa. \u00a0The examination of both their scars will be between them and I am of the opinion that this is the emotional scene David Nutter referenced in the EW interview.</p><p>If as I proposed there is a romantic encounter between Jon and Sansa that harkens back to the one between Ned and Cat from episode one, then I think that just as Luwin knocked on the door of the Lord\u2019s Chamber after N&amp;C made love, Sam will do the same with the younger Starks. \u00a0Like with Luwin, Sam will come bearing a scroll with bad news. \u00a0And I think that it will turn out to be this scroll that Sophie was referring to in her interview. \u00a0</p><p>However, unlike the one from Lysa, it won\u2019t arrive via a raven. \u00a0Nonetheless, just as the one from Lysa resulted in Ned, the Lord of the House heading south, I think that the one Sam bears will mean the same thing for Sansa, the current Lady of Winterfell as Jon sends her away for protection. \u00a0I also think that in Kings Landing, we will get to see a reenactment of the tale told by the common folks in the books of how she escaped from the Red Keep.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe dwarf\u2019s wife did the murder with him,\u201d swore an archer in Lord Rowan\u2019s livery. \u201cAfterward, she vanished from the hall in a puff of brimstone,<b> and a ghostly direwolf was seen prowling the Red Keep, blood dripping from his jaws.\u201d</b></p><p><b>A Storm of Swords - Jaime VII</b></p></blockquote><p>If the scroll that Sam bears does not arrive via a raven then the question becomes, where did it come from. \u00a0Well, as I\u2019ve speculated in other posts, I\u2019m of the opinion that it was unknowingly brought to Winterfell by Sam himself. \u00a0In fact, I suspect that it is the very same scroll that Sam is shown stealing in the scene below of when he left the Citadel. \u00a0You can find the specific theft at the 2:07 mark.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2F1ueJGz6c5g0\"><iframe width=\"540\"

She also gets out of the bed naked in front of Luwin after he arrives with the scroll. \u00a0When Ned comments that she is embarrassing the maester, she responds that he has birth all her children and so has seen everything she has to offer on multiple occasions.</p><p>After reading Lysa\u2019s note, Ned decides to accept Robert\u2019s request that he become the Hand of the King. \u00a0On the show, Cat is resistant to him going while in the books, she encourages him to do so. \u00a0In both instances, she is looking to protect her family. \u00a0And so Ned heads to Kings Landing with the king where he meets his death and his family\u2019s life is all but destroyed as a result. \u00a0As a callback, I think that we may get a similar scene this season involving a scroll but it won\u2019t be one that comes via a raven.</p><p>Many of us have speculated on the possibility of something of a romantic nature happening in the Lord\u2019s Chamber between Jon and Sansa. \u00a0For myself, I\u2019ve felt that it was a strong possibility since the writers made a point of letting the audience know that Jon had arranged for her to have the suite\u2026especially as it was done in the same scene that he gave her that longing forehead kiss. My theory is that once the truth about Jon\u2019s identity comes out, the emotional scene that David Nutter mentioned will occur between him and Sansa in the Lord\u2019s Chamber and it will lead to them making love.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe fans will not be let down,\u201d says director David Nutter. \u201cThere are a lot of firsts in these episodes. There\u2019s the funniest sequence I\u2019ve ever shot on this show, <b>the most emotional and compelling scene I\u2019ve ever shot</b>, and there\u2019s one scene where there\u2019s so many [major characters] together it feels like you\u2019re watching a superhero movie.\u201d-<b>David Nutter, Entertainment Weekly</b></p></blockquote><p>I think this for several reasons. \u00a0First, as I\u2019ve mentioned, with all the callbacks to the first episode, it makes sense that there is one of the scene between Ned and Cat in the Lord\u2019s Chamber as it was so important to the story. \u00a0Secondly, Sansa having a romantic encounter with a man who loves her for herself and not her inheritance has been part of her character arc in both on the show and in the books. \u00a0On the show, Petyr sold her to the Boltons and we all know what happened there. \u00a0Unfortunately, I don\u2019t rule out something similar happening in the Vale from either Petyr or Harry the Heir. \u00a0It maybe just an attempt but I definitely can see it happening. </p><p>Since she escaped from Ramsay\u2019s clutches on the show, Sansa has been understandably protecting herself both mentally and physically. \u00a0Part of this self-protection is reflected in how she dresses. \u00a0She is always covered from head to toe and she dresses in clothing that are difficult to take off. \u00a0Even her hands are not available for anyone to touch. \u00a0The only people who have been allowed to touch any part of her have been her family when she reunited with them. \u00a0These have included a few notable moments with Jon\u2014when she grabs his hand and most notably when he gave her the forehead kiss. \u00a0</p><p>A part of Sansa\u2019s arc has also been about learning to trust again and to allow a man in. \u00a0It is without a doubt not the only part of her arc and it is not even the most important. \u00a0Nevertheless, it is an aspect of her story and the likelihood of a romantic encounter between her and a man has been percolating throughout her arc. \u00a0The only question is with whom. \u00a0</p><p>Unlike what some think, it won\u2019t be with the Hound as in my opinion, his part in her story\u2026especially in the books will ultimately be shown to be about Jon or at least Jon as he will be upon his return. \u00a0The Hound\u2019s savage nature reflects what Jon will be like when he returns from the dead after his consciousness spends some time in Ghost. \u00a0I think it\u2019s why Martin gave him a moniker reminiscent of a wolfhound. \u00a0And as Sansa tempered the Hound, she will temper Jon. \u00a0Plus, Sandor Clegane is old enough to be Sansa\u2019s father and relationships between older men and girls young enough to be their daughters are one that George\u2019s writings shows to be abhorrent and must end. </p><p>It also won\u2019t be Tyrion for too many reasons to list\u2026least of all being that Sansa would never join with a Lannister after what they did to her family. \u00a0Plus, that is not the story either George or D&amp;D have been writing. \u00a0And it most certainly won\u2019t be Gendry or Pod\u2026two men she doesn\u2019t know. \u00a0In my book, this only leaves Jon. \u00a0A romantic relationship between the two has been hinted at in both the books and show. \u00a0And as there are only 6 episodes left, it has to happen this season. \u00a0</p><p>We also need to remember that this is <i>Game of Thrones</i> that we are talking about and the writers like to throw sex at the audience. \u00a0 With war and almost certain death looming for most of our heroes, it\u2019s almost guaranteed that there will be at least one this year as well and I suspect it will be the most important one of the entire series. \u00a0Making love and connecting to another human being before going off to war is a popular trope in both literature and the visual medium. \u00a0When one knows that one is facing death, it forces you to deal and acknowledge what is most important. \u00a0</p><p>Another reason I think that there will be a romantic encounter between the two eldest remaining Starks in the Lord\u2019s Chamber is because since they reunited, D&amp;D has written them with the angst George described in his original outline for Jon and Arya. \u00a0And so it seems possible to me that based on D&amp;D\u2019s writing George quite likely switched things up with the sisters. \u00a0There are many great metas out there that breakdown the many book clues point to a potential romantic relationship between Jon and Sansa and so there is no need to delve into those them here again as this article is about the show.</p><p>The scene I propose will occur between Jon and Sansa may also explain why things were downplayed in the one between him and Dany. \u00a0I think the emotional baring of the soul by Jon\u2019s in regards to the truth about his heritage, the fact that he was killed by his men and an examination of his scars both of the physical and mental variety will take place between him and Sansa. \u00a0The examination of both their scars will be between them and I am of the opinion that this is the emotional scene David Nutter referenced in the EW interview.</p><p>If as I proposed there is a romantic encounter between Jon and Sansa that harkens back to the one between Ned and Cat from episode one, then I think that just as Luwin knocked on the door of the Lord\u2019s Chamber after N&amp;C made love, Sam will do the same with the younger Starks. \u00a0Like with Luwin, Sam will come bearing a scroll with bad news. \u00a0And I think that it will turn out to be this scroll that Sophie was referring to in her interview. \u00a0</p><p>However, unlike the one from Lysa, it won\u2019t arrive via a raven. \u00a0Nonetheless, just as the one from Lysa resulted in Ned, the Lord of the House heading south, I think that the one Sam bears will mean the same thing for Sansa, the current Lady of Winterfell as Jon sends her away for protection. \u00a0I also think that in Kings Landing, we will get to see a reenactment of the tale told by the common folks in the books of how she escaped from the Red Keep.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe dwarf\u2019s wife did the murder with him,\u201d swore an archer in Lord Rowan\u2019s livery. \u201cAfterward, she vanished from the hall in a puff of brimstone,<b> and a ghostly direwolf was seen prowling the Red Keep, blood dripping from his jaws.\u201d</b></p><p><b>A Storm of Swords - Jaime VII</b></p></blockquote><p>If the scroll that Sam bears does not arrive via a raven then the question becomes, where did it come from. \u00a0Well, as I\u2019ve speculated in other posts, I\u2019m of the opinion that it was unknowingly brought to Winterfell by Sam himself. \u00a0In fact, I suspect that it is the very same scroll that Sam is shown stealing in the scene below of when he left the Citadel. \u00a0You can find the specific theft at the 2:07 mark.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2F1ueJGz6c5g0\"><iframe width=\"540\"

And now we find out from Sophie and Maisie\u2019s interview that a scroll will play an important role in the final season. \u00a0I don\u2019t know about you but I\u2019m adding 1 and 1 and getting 2. \u00a0</p><p>To add more fire to my theory, consider the photo released of Jorah and Dany standing in what looks to be an office with a shelf filled with scrolls behind them. \u00a0Just happenstance? \u00a0I say not. \u00a0I suspect that this is the same office that Sam has been using since he came to Winterfell and knowing him, he most likely just stashed the scroll he took from the Citadel in with the ones already on the shelf with plans to look at it later.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1758\" data-orig-height=\"1168\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/622884f3b4373c768926bf7d0632359e/tumblr_inline_pp8w4olLDf1scj86c_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1758\" data-orig-height=\"1168\"></figure><p>Now if I\u2019m right and the scroll in question is the one Sam stole, the size of it suggests that it is not the type that usually bears a message. \u00a0The fact that it was taken from the Citadel also indicates that it contains old and possibly even truly ancient knowledge. \u00a0If so, then it most likely has something to do with the mystery surrounding the Night King and the White Walkers.</p><p>Things get even more interesting when you consider the fact that Sophie\u2019s comment about the scroll being given to her as a memento of her time on the show strongly suggests that whatever is in it has to do with the character of Sansa Stark. \u00a0The obvious question then becomes, why would an ancient scroll about the Night King have something to do with Sansa? \u00a0Nothing would be the obvious answer! \u00a0Unless that is, the scroll in question has something to do with the Corpse Queen.</p><p>The story of the Night\u2019s King is also the story of the Corpse Queen. \u00a0The two go hand in hand. \u00a0In this instance, I am talking about the book version and not the Night King from the show. \u00a0However, as his tale in the books is knotted to that of his queen, I believe that there also must be one on the show.</p><p>Many in the fandom have proposed that because white has been introduced into Dany\u2019s costume in such a way as to promote the idea of her as the Night\u2019s Queen (the fandom name for the Corpse Queen), it must mean that she is the one that the NK is after. \u00a0I for one think that is just the writers working to throw people of the true trail. \u00a0The Corpse Queen is ice not fire. \u00a0</p><p>The only two remaining female characters on the show that fulfill the necessary criteria are Arya and Sansa. \u00a0I happen to think that the elder Stark daughter with her \u201ckissed by fire\u201d hair will turn out to be queen in more ways than one. \u00a0And as I proposed in this <a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/173321285156/beric-dondarrion-will-give-the-kiss-of-life-to\" target=\"_blank\"><b>essay</b></a> about her kidnapping by Cersei, Beric will give her the \u201ckiss of life.\u201d \u00a0Sansa will literally have been kissed by fire when Beric brings her back.\u00a0 Hence, when she ascends to the throne\u2026whether of all of Westeros or just of the North, she will for all intents and purposes be the Corpse Queen.</p><p>Now, I have to say that I strongly think that things will play out in a totally different manner in the books. \u00a0I\u2019m not saying that Sansa won\u2019t be the modern day version of the Corpse Queen. \u00a0I think that will also be the case in the books. \u00a0However, I think that the seeds George sprinkles in his garden to get there will be much different than Dan and Dave.</p><p>Before I end, I want to mention a couple of other callbacks I think will play out in the final season. \u00a0Based on the trailer, I would not be surprise to see a version of the scene between Ned and Cat in the Godswood from the first episode. \u00a0We don\u2019t see Sansa in the shot of Jon by the weirwood tree but I suspect that she is either sitting on the limb and Jon\u2019s body is hiding her or else, she will approaching him just as Cat did to Ned as he was cleaning Ice. \u00a0</p><p>I also think that the scene of Dany approaching Jon in the crypts is a call back to Ned and Robert visiting Lyanna\u2019s statue in season one. \u00a0While the obvious thought is that Jon is standing in front of the statue, I\u2019m not quite sure that is the case because as @<a href=\"https://thelawyerthatwaspromised.tumblr.com/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank\" target=\"_blank\">thelawyerthatwaspromised</a> pointed out in her breakdown essay of the scene, Dany\u2019s approach from the other side of the crypt does not match up with the location of Lyanna\u2019s statue (unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t find the essay in question to post a link). \u00a0It\u2019s possible that the positioning of the statue is a mistake on the part of the show but I doubt it. \u00a0</p><p>I don\u2019t know the reason but even if he is not standing in front of his mother\u2019s statue in the trailer, I suspect that he and Dany will still have a conversation in front of it.\u00a0 It is here that I suspect Jon and Dany will have the conversation about her burning Sam\u2019s father and brother.\u00a0 Her face as she approaches him is filled with trepidation.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1746\" data-orig-height=\"866\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c22a3e42a767855b8696e5932b20fe0e/tumblr_inline_pp8wt0I4HP1scj86c_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1746\" data-orig-height=\"866\"></figure><p>What she did to Sam\u2019s family and the other men who didn\u2019t bend the knee is partially why just as Ned did not tell Robert the truth in that the moment, Jon also will not reveal his true identity to Dany.\u00a0 He will fear the danger the revelation could mean to him and his family as well as the effect her potential actions could have on the battle against the White Walkers. \u00a0Plus, he has no interest in the Iron Throne.</p><p>As I said at the beginning, this is purely a speculative essay but with the many callbacks expected, it\u2019s quite possible that some of these scenarios I proposed might indeed play out.</p>",
                "content": "<p>March 31, 2019</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c9f42be80a91bffdd47ae15bb5aa84d0/tumblr_inline_pp8vuj5ER11scj86c_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>This is a speculative essay about the final season of Game of Thrones and it discusses some of the cast and crew interviews leading up to the premier of the show. &nbsp;I will read interviews by the actors as a show or movie is about to premier but I also like to avoid learning about any specific spoilers. &nbsp;By definition, discussing these interviews is not really talking about spoilers but one cannot ignore that sometimes actors or crewmembers do inadvertently make comments that could point to the potential direction of a story. &nbsp;As I know not everyone will have read the articles and some may not want to know what the actors said, the rest of this discussion will take place under the cut. &nbsp;If you proceed, do so with the understanding that the subject is about &ldquo;potential spoilers.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>I&rsquo;m intrigue by the season 8 photo of Sansa posted above. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s possible that it is from an indoor scene but I tend to think that it&rsquo;s outdoors. &nbsp;However, it&rsquo;s hard to say definitively. &nbsp;To me, it looks like she could possibly be standing in front of a tent or one being set up and that&rsquo;s part of the reason I find the photo so intriguing. &nbsp;It makes me wonder whether it is an image of Sansa away from Winterfell.</p><p>Of course, if it is a tent, it does not mean that it is not one in the vicinity of Winterfell. &nbsp;There are a lot of troops arrayed outside the castle and so it could be that she is just visiting the camp with Jon and or other leaders to give the troops encouragement before the great battle. &nbsp;Nonetheless, I can&rsquo;t help but extrapolate out based on comments made by the actors, directors and writers in interviews during the publicity rounds for the season premier.</p><p>When I first speculated <b><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/183245767101/beric-dondarrion-will-give-the-kiss-of-life-to\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></b> that Cersei would send the Golden Company north to kidnap Sansa, I suggested that it would happen when Jon sends her away from Winterfell to White Harbor or the Vale for her protection. &nbsp;I still think that might be how things play out. &nbsp;In fact, after reading various interviews I&rsquo;m now more incline to think that will be the case. &nbsp;A final confrontation between Cersei and Sansa is also a plot thread that has been hanging since season five and while I don&rsquo;t expect them to meet again in the books, it seems like a foregone conclusion that they will on the show.</p><p>For this reason, I&rsquo;m wondering if the photo of Sansa with what could possibly be a soup bowl in her hand is of her on the road to the Vale and if the scene potentially occurs right before her retinue is attacked by the Golden Company. &nbsp;The item in her hand does not quite look like a soup bowl&mdash;at least not one that would be used by the lords and ladies of the realm. &nbsp;However, it might be one used by common soldiers and so it&rsquo;s possible that it is one of them who offer her soup. &nbsp;This is of course pure speculation on my part and so the scene could be of something totally different. </p><p>The actors and those behind the show have stated that there will be a lot of callbacks to the first episode of the series and we can already see this will be the case from the trailer. &nbsp;Arya is in Wintertown as Dany arrives just as she was in episode one when Robert came to Winterfell. &nbsp;There is a young boy shown from a roof looking at the army as it arrives just as Bran watched the knights of Robert&rsquo;s court. &nbsp;As an aside, I fully expect bad things to happen to the little boy as it did to Bran. &nbsp;And of course, Sansa greets Dany as Ned welcomed King Robert and hands Winterfell over to her for the duration of her stay.</p><p>With so many callbacks shown in the trailer, it&rsquo;s to be expected that there will be more in the actual show. &nbsp;In point of fact, I expect there to be a callback to one of the two most important scenes from the first episode of the series, and which also jumpstarted the entire story. &nbsp; I am of course talking of Cat receiving the scroll from Lysa and the message stated therein.</p><p>The scene took place in the Lord&rsquo;s Chamber. &nbsp;Ned and Cat were lying in bed after making love when Maester Luwin arrived with the scroll from Lysa saying that the Lannisters murdered her husband. &nbsp;On the show, the Lord and Lady of Winterfell are in robes and so it is not as obvious as on the pages that they had just made love. &nbsp;In the books, we get the end of the encounter and Cat thoughts about it. She also gets out of the bed naked in front of Luwin after he arrives with the scroll. &nbsp;When Ned comments that she is embarrassing the maester, she responds that he has birth all her children and so has seen everything she has to offer on multiple occasions.</p><p>After reading Lysa&rsquo;s note, Ned decides to accept Robert&rsquo;s request that he become the Hand of the King. &nbsp;On the show, Cat is resistant to him going while in the books, she encourages him to do so. &nbsp;In both instances, she is looking to protect her family. &nbsp;And so Ned heads to Kings Landing with the king where he meets his death and his family&rsquo;s life is all but destroyed as a result. &nbsp;As a callback, I think that we may get a similar scene this season involving a scroll but it won&rsquo;t be one that comes via a raven.</p><p>Many of us have speculated on the possibility of something of a romantic nature happening in the Lord&rsquo;s Chamber between Jon and Sansa. &nbsp;For myself, I&rsquo;ve felt that it was a strong possibility since the writers made a point of letting the audience know that Jon had arranged for her to have the suite&hellip;especially as it was done in the same scene that he gave her that longing forehead kiss. My theory is that once the truth about Jon&rsquo;s identity comes out, the emotional scene that David Nutter mentioned will occur between him and Sansa in the Lord&rsquo;s Chamber and it will lead to them making love.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The fans will not be let down,&rdquo; says director David Nutter. &ldquo;There are a lot of firsts in these episodes. There&rsquo;s the funniest sequence I&rsquo;ve ever shot on this show, <b>the most emotional and compelling scene I&rsquo;ve ever shot</b>, and there&rsquo;s one scene where there&rsquo;s so many [major characters] together it feels like you&rsquo;re watching a superhero movie.&rdquo;-<b>David Nutter, Entertainment Weekly</b></p></blockquote><p>I think this for several reasons. &nbsp;First, as I&rsquo;ve mentioned, with all the callbacks to the first episode, it makes sense that there is one of the scene between Ned and Cat in the Lord&rsquo;s Chamber as it was so important to the story. &nbsp;Secondly, Sansa having a romantic encounter with a man who loves her for herself and not her inheritance has been part of her character arc in both on the show and in the books. &nbsp;On the show, Petyr sold her to the Boltons and we all know what happened there. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t rule out something similar happening in the Vale from either Petyr or Harry the Heir. &nbsp;It maybe just an attempt but I definitely can see it happening. </p><p>Since she escaped from Ramsay&rsquo;s clutches on the show, Sansa has been understandably protecting herself both mentally and physically. &nbsp;Part of this self-protection is reflected in how she dresses. &nbsp;She is always covered from head to toe and she dresses in clothing that are difficult to take off. &nbsp;Even her hands are not available for anyone to touch. &nbsp;The only people who have been allowed to touch any part of her have been her family when she reunited with them. &nbsp;These have included a few notable moments with Jon&mdash;when she grabs his hand and most notably when he gave her the forehead kiss. &nbsp;</p><p>A part of Sansa&rsquo;s arc has also been about learning to trust again and to allow a man in. &nbsp;It is without a doubt not the only part of her arc and it is not even the most important. &nbsp;Nevertheless, it is an aspect of her story and the likelihood of a romantic encounter between her and a man has been percolating throughout her arc. &nbsp;The only question is with whom. &nbsp;</p><p>Unlike what some think, it won&rsquo;t be with the Hound as in my opinion, his part in her story&hellip;especially in the books will ultimately be shown to be about Jon or at least Jon as he will be upon his return. &nbsp;The Hound&rsquo;s savage nature reflects what Jon will be like when he returns from the dead after his consciousness spends some time in Ghost. &nbsp;I think it&rsquo;s why Martin gave him a moniker reminiscent of a wolfhound. &nbsp;And as Sansa tempered the Hound, she will temper Jon. &nbsp;Plus, Sandor Clegane is old enough to be Sansa&rsquo;s father and relationships between older men and girls young enough to be their daughters are one that George&rsquo;s writings shows to be abhorrent and must end. </p><p>It also won&rsquo;t be Tyrion for too many reasons to list&hellip;least of all being that Sansa would never join with a Lannister after what they did to her family. &nbsp;Plus, that is not the story either George or D&amp;D have been writing. &nbsp;And it most certainly won&rsquo;t be Gendry or Pod&hellip;two men she doesn&rsquo;t know. &nbsp;In my book, this only leaves Jon. &nbsp;A romantic relationship between the two has been hinted at in both the books and show. &nbsp;And as there are only 6 episodes left, it has to happen this season. &nbsp;</p><p>We also need to remember that this is <i>Game of Thrones</i> that we are talking about and the writers like to throw sex at the audience. &nbsp; With war and almost certain death looming for most of our heroes, it&rsquo;s almost guaranteed that there will be at least one this year as well and I suspect it will be the most important one of the entire series. &nbsp;Making love and connecting to another human being before going off to war is a popular trope in both literature and the visual medium. &nbsp;When one knows that one is facing death, it forces you to deal and acknowledge what is most important. &nbsp;</p><p>Another reason I think that there will be a romantic encounter between the two eldest remaining Starks in the Lord&rsquo;s Chamber is because since they reunited, D&amp;D has written them with the angst George described in his original outline for Jon and Arya. &nbsp;And so it seems possible to me that based on D&amp;D&rsquo;s writing George quite likely switched things up with the sisters. &nbsp;There are many great metas out there that breakdown the many book clues point to a potential romantic relationship between Jon and Sansa and so there is no need to delve into those them here again as this article is about the show.</p><p>The scene I propose will occur between Jon and Sansa may also explain why things were downplayed in the one between him and Dany. &nbsp;I think the emotional baring of the soul by Jon&rsquo;s in regards to the truth about his heritage, the fact that he was killed by his men and an examination of his scars both of the physical and mental variety will take place between him and Sansa. &nbsp;The examination of both their scars will be between them and I am of the opinion that this is the emotional scene David Nutter referenced in the EW interview.</p><p>If as I proposed there is a romantic encounter between Jon and Sansa that harkens back to the one between Ned and Cat from episode one, then I think that just as Luwin knocked on the door of the Lord&rsquo;s Chamber after N&amp;C made love, Sam will do the same with the younger Starks. &nbsp;Like with Luwin, Sam will come bearing a scroll with bad news. &nbsp;And I think that it will turn out to be this scroll that Sophie was referring to in her interview. &nbsp;</p><p>However, unlike the one from Lysa, it won&rsquo;t arrive via a raven. &nbsp;Nonetheless, just as the one from Lysa resulted in Ned, the Lord of the House heading south, I think that the one Sam bears will mean the same thing for Sansa, the current Lady of Winterfell as Jon sends her away for protection. &nbsp;I also think that in Kings Landing, we will get to see a reenactment of the tale told by the common folks in the books of how she escaped from the Red Keep.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The dwarf&rsquo;s wife did the murder with him,&rdquo; swore an archer in Lord Rowan&rsquo;s livery. &ldquo;Afterward, she vanished from the hall in a puff of brimstone,<b> and a ghostly direwolf was seen prowling the Red Keep, blood dripping from his jaws.&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>A Storm of Swords - Jaime VII</b></p></blockquote><p>If the scroll that Sam bears does not arrive via a raven then the question becomes, where did it come from. &nbsp;Well, as I&rsquo;ve speculated in other posts, I&rsquo;m of the opinion that it was unknowingly brought to Winterfell by Sam himself. &nbsp;In fact, I suspect that it is the very same scroll that Sam is shown stealing in the scene below of when he left the Citadel. &nbsp;You can find the specific theft at the 2:07 mark.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\"><p><a href=\"#\"><img src=\"https://assets.tumblr.com/images/inline_placeholder.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"14\"/></a></p></figure><p>We are shown hundreds of scrolls on the shelves and yet Sam only takes one. And now we find out from Sophie and Maisie&rsquo;s interview that a scroll will play an important role in the final season. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know about you but I&rsquo;m adding 1 and 1 and getting 2. &nbsp;</p><p>To add more fire to my theory, consider the photo released of Jorah and Dany standing in what looks to be an office with a shelf filled with scrolls behind them. &nbsp;Just happenstance?
