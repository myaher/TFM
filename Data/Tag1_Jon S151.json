Or anyone&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t like that either,&rdquo; Theon says, reaching out with a gloved hand to wipe an invisible stain from the statue&rsquo;s somber forehead.

It looks like a caress. </p><p>&ldquo;Stop crying, Theon.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I think I have forgotten how to stop.&rdquo; Theon&rsquo;s face is hidden in the shadows now, his shoulders are trembling. &ldquo;I should be dried out, but there are always more to come.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon hesitates, briefly glancing at the true King in the North&rsquo;s stony face, a great likeness, only missing the warmth those eyes had always looked on him with. Would Robb understand? Would he approve? </p><p>Jon takes off his own fur-lined glove, lifting his hand until it&rsquo;s an inch from Theon&rsquo;s face. Theon stands very still, hardly even breathing. He doesn&rsquo;t flinch back, so Jon takes a half step, until his fingertips touch Theon&rsquo;s cold, wet cheek. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve cried enough for the three of us.&rdquo; Jon smiles, slowly wiping his thumb over Theon&rsquo;s cheekbone. &ldquo;That and the thawing snow will drown us if you don&rsquo;t watch it.&rdquo;</p><p>Theon exhales carefully, not moving a single muscle, letting Jon wipe away the fresh salt from under his eyes. He smiles, just a tiny flicker on his thin lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Snow is melting,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll drown you all. My father would be so proud.&rdquo; </p><p>Jon rolls his eyes, letting his fingers wander to stroke Theon&rsquo;s strawy hair behind his ear, his gaze wandering over to the statue again.

You were all sitting on the steps that lead up to the throne.</p><p>\u201cHow could you not? Of course it\u2019s hopeless for the both of you. A sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight. Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen. But we always want the wrong woman.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>You sighed slightly playing with hilt of your sword once again. Your thumb gazing over the red gem in the center that made it painfully obvious it was a Lannister\u2019s sword.</p><p>\u201cDoes he always talk so much?\u201d Darrio asked</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately.\u201d Is what you responded with, while Jorah only gave a small nod to confirm what you had said</p><p>The footsteps began as someone turned the corner. You looked up to see a man with bandages around his torso, he had a darker complexion. And Messandei who was with him, helping him along. </p><p>\u201cJorah the Andal.\u201d Is what he said to greet the knight.</p><p>\u201cTorgo Nudho.\u201d Jorah replied</p><p>\u201cHe should not be here.\u201d</p><p>You straightened your back slightly as Darrio began to speak in response \u201cNo, but he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur queen ordered him exiled from the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe saved our queen\u2019s life. IF it wasn\u2019t for him, we would have no queen, no chance to take back the seven kingdoms.\u201d You stated looking at the man who looked more like a boy.</p><p>Messandei turned to the man and spoke to him in Valayrian before she paused and looked at Tyrion before saying something else in Valayrian. To which Tyron responded and she then responded back to him, correcting his Valaryian.</p><p>\u201cSorry I not there to fight for our queen.\u201d </p><p>His common tongue wasn\u2019t the best, but you could understand what he was saying. Lucia not having a good grasp on the language as well spoke in sentences just like his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou missed a good scrap. Good thing this little knightress was there to protect her as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a knight.\u201d You defended</p><p>\u201cNone of that matters now.\u201dJorah interupted. \u201cThe longer we sit here bantering, the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion nodded before speaking himself \u201cHe\u2019s right. The dragon headed north. If we\u2019re going to find her that\u2019s where we\u2019ll have to go.\u201d </p><p>Tyrion stood from his sitting position on the steps and pulled up his breeches as you continued to sit.</p><p>\u201cWe? You\u2019re both Lannisters. The queen intends to remove power from your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we intend to help her do it.\u201d You stated standing up as well following your uncle down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been here for how many days now? I\u2019ve fought for her for years. Since she was little more than a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou betrayed her!\u201d Tyrion exclaimed</p><p>\u201cCareful now.\u201d Jorah warned</p><p>\u201cAnd she exiled you. Twice, I believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe second time thanks to you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame me for your crimes, Mormont!\u201d</p><p>Darrio stood and help his hand out to signal for Tyrion to stop speaking, he walked forward, stepping down a few steps</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right. Our queen exiled Jorah. And she\u2019s right Jorah saved her life. Perhaps she feels differently about him now. Perhaps not. The only way we\u2019ll know is if we ask her.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion rolled his eyes slightly </p><p>\u201cFine, fine. I suppose he can join us. Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I ever kill you, your eyes will be wide open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo death threats.\u201d You warned \u201cI heard enough of those from my brother when he was alive, I don\u2019t need it from someone like you, Jorah. Play nice.\u201d</p><p>Darrio gave you a thankful nod before looking at Tyrion \u201cForgive me, but why would we bring you? We\u2019re more likely to bring her.\u201d He said gesturing to you.</p><p>\u201cPardon me?\u201d You and Tyrion asked in unison.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever tracked animals in the wilderness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot precisely, but I have other skills that would be useful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have fought. I don\u2019t claim to be a great warrior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you good on a horse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiddling.\u201d Tyrion defended</p><p>\u201cSo mainly you talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn his defense, his talking got has gotten him out of many things. He\u2019s very persuasive and very convincing. However he also drinks. He\u2019s survived so far.\u201d You spoke up in defense stepping down another step</p><p>\u201cI do respect that, but would he not help us on this expedition. You would help us here in Meereen, though. None of us have experienced governing a city except for him. You want to prove your value to the queen? Prove it right here in Meereen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a foreign dwarf that barley speaks the language. Why would the Meerenese listen to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJorah, If I do recall correctly, Messandei knows the language very well, and has translated low Valyrian into High Valyrian and into the common tongue for the queen. I do believe if he needs help he can ask her. Other than that he is a very good advisor. If it weren\u2019t for him we would have lost the battle at Blackwater Bay.\u201d You said with furrowed brows. No one ever got away with belittling your family. Even if that family was annoying at times.</p><p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t listen to him, but they will listen to Grey Worm.\u201d</p><p>The man stepped forward \u201cI\u2019ll come with you. I\u2019ll find our queen.\u201d</p><p>Messandei stepped forward placing a hand on his chest in a worried manner. Much like how you would if someone you loved was hurt</p><p>\u201cYou are not strong enough to go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is. He\u2019s the toughest man with no balls I ever met. But you still can\u2019t go. The people believe in you. They now you speak for the queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. Only the Unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen. If you leave, half this city will consume the other half.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Missandei. Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei. Certainly not me. The queen\u2019s closest confidante, The commander of the Unsullied, A foreign dwarf with a scarred face, and a seasoned knightress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not leaving me here are you?\u201d You questioned with furrowed brows \u201cAlso, for the last time, I\u2019m not a knight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would serve as a Queen\u2019s Guard. If Tyrion is in charge, you protect him.\u201d</p><p>You nodded and gave him a small smile</p><p>\u201cGood fortune my friends. Meereen is ancient and glorious. Try not to ruin her. Look like it\u2019s you and me Jorah the Andal. Let\u2019s find some good horses. We have so much to talk about.\u201d Daario patted Jorah\u2019s shoulder then began to walk away from the thrones room and Jorah followed. Which left you, Tyrion, Missandei and Grey Worm.</p><p>You sat on the balcony of your chambers, glass of wine in hand as you looked over the sand. Jorah and Daario on their horses going to find Daenerys. </p><p>Queen\u2019s Guard. Who would\u2019ve thought that at age nineteen you\u2019d been in the ancient city of Meereen, in a downplayed dress than what you were used to wearing, Joffrey\u2019s sword strapped to your side and in the role of Queen\u2019s Guard to protect Tyrion while the queen was gone. </p><p>As a child you never thought you\u2019d leave King\u2019s Landing. Then you had gone to Winterfell. Stopping in the River Lands plenty of times on your way to the North. A place you wish you could go back to. A place you wish you could see Jon again. But he was in the Night\u2019s Watch, and from what you had heard by the little birds all around the world, he was making something of himself there. Lord Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch. One day, Lucia would get a kick out of that when you told her how he was when you first met him.</p><p>He was just the bastard boy of Winterfell. You were princess Y/N Baratheon of the Seven Kingdoms. You had a name, you had lands that belonged to Robert. And if it ever came down to it, you would have became queen. You would have had armies fighting for you if you ever commanded it. You knew she would one day wonder how a young fifteen year old you fell in love so quickly, for a boy who was only known as Ned Stark\u2019s bastard. You knew what you would one day tell her that nobody got to choose who they loved. </p><p>Your mother loved her brother. Robert Baratheon loved Lyanna Stark. Robb Stark loved a woman who wasn\u2019t his betrothed. And it got him killed. You fell for a northern boy. You weren\u2019t anything but children at the time. You had been so in love you never thought about how badly you\u2019d miss him. How bad this aching heart would feel. It was dull when you had fallen pregnant and when you had Lucia by your side. But now&hellip; Now that she wasn\u2019t by your side you felt your heart ache for her and her father.</p><p>\u201cMama!\u201d</p><p>You turned your head quickly. There she was. Her hair longer than before. The beautiful black curls of her father, her dark brown eyes that were so familiar, and the pale skin with her flush cheeks and nose. She had his nose. You\u2019d noticed this only now. </p><p>Her small dress fit her perfectly. A rarity for her, since she was still growing. The sound of her bare feet on the sound rang in your ears as she spotted you when Messandei brought her in. She was running to you arms out to be picked up. </p><p>You set down the wineglass walking with long strides to meet her in the middle. You grabbed her by her torso, picking her up and holding her. One hand rested on her bottom to keep her up and the other on the back of her head as her arms wrapped around your neck to hold you close. You buried your head into her shoulder getting the comforting smell of your daughter, who still smelled like firewood, a smell she had picked up when she found out she could touch fire without being hurt.</p><p>\u201cI missed you mama.\u201d You mumbled happily.</p><p>\u201cI missed you too Luci.\u201d You said using her nickname. </p><p>You looked at Messandei gratefully with a big smile as you sat down with her in your lap. She sat up straight and smiled at you real big and pointed to your dress.</p><p>\u201cPretty!\u201d She exclaimed happily. You laughed and nodded kissing her head forcefully </p><p>\u201cMessandei, thank you so much for bringing her to me.\u201d You said, tears in your eyes as he let a hand rest on the small of Lucia\u2019s back</p><p>Messandei smiled and nodded. \u201cThe man who had her, his name is Varys I beleive, Said she desperately wanted to see her mother. The way you had described her, matched her. So I brought her up here personally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell Varys thank you for me?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and went to leave. You looked down at Lucia and asked \u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><p>She held up three fingers excitedly </p><p>\u201cVarys says I\u2019m three!\u201d</p><p>You nodded and set her down on the ground. \u201cIt was your name day yesterday. What do you say&hellip; We go to the garden? Make a crown out of flowers for a brave little girl?\u201d</p><p>She nodded happily and you stood and took her hand walking out of the room and down the corridor.</p><p>You had a few roses, a couple of daises and a few small yellow ones. All of which were there to excentuate the pink roses you\u2019d found. You had her pick the daises and the nameless yellow ones, while you had picked and dethroned the roses. </p><p>\u201cMama?\u201d</p><p>You looked over to Lucia while you sat on the ground. She was standing twirling one of the dethroned roses in her hands while you held your dagger against a rose ready to take off yet another throne</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d You questioned</p><p>\u201cDo I have a papa?\u201d</p><p>You furrowed your brows in confusion. What had brought this on? She\u2019d never questioned you on such things before. She was usually so content with what she had. You and Tyrion, and Varys. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, my love?\u201d</p><p>She looked down at her feet almost embarrassed in a way as she seemed to be thinking. She was so young. Only the age of three, and she had so much on her plate already.</p><p>\u201cI saw others with their mamas and other people, Varys said the other people were their papas. Do I have one?\u201d</p><p>You smiled sadly and put down the rose and dagger holding a hand out for her to take. Her small hand took your larger one as you pulled her into your lap</p><p>\u201cYour papa, is the best man I ever met. He\u2019s strong, and he\u2019d love you to bits. Every inch of his being would go to loving you just like mine does.\u201d You said with a happy smile</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>You pushed a curl behind her ear and smiled once more.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s serving people. Keeping everyone safe. They call them the crows. Crows of the Night\u2019s Watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I be a crow?\u201d </p><p>Your face stiffened as you thought of what to say next.

You were all sitting on the steps that lead up to the throne.</p><p>\u201cHow could you not? Of course it\u2019s hopeless for the both of you. A sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight. Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen. But we always want the wrong woman.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>You sighed slightly playing with hilt of your sword once again. Your thumb gazing over the red gem in the center that made it painfully obvious it was a Lannister\u2019s sword.</p><p>\u201cDoes he always talk so much?\u201d Darrio asked</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately.\u201d Is what you responded with, while Jorah only gave a small nod to confirm what you had said</p><p>The footsteps began as someone turned the corner. You looked up to see a man with bandages around his torso, he had a darker complexion. And Messandei who was with him, helping him along. </p><p>\u201cJorah the Andal.\u201d Is what he said to greet the knight.</p><p>\u201cTorgo Nudho.\u201d Jorah replied</p><p>\u201cHe should not be here.\u201d</p><p>You straightened your back slightly as Darrio began to speak in response \u201cNo, but he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur queen ordered him exiled from the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe saved our queen\u2019s life. IF it wasn\u2019t for him, we would have no queen, no chance to take back the seven kingdoms.\u201d You stated looking at the man who looked more like a boy.</p><p>Messandei turned to the man and spoke to him in Valayrian before she paused and looked at Tyrion before saying something else in Valayrian. To which Tyron responded and she then responded back to him, correcting his Valaryian.</p><p>\u201cSorry I not there to fight for our queen.\u201d </p><p>His common tongue wasn\u2019t the best, but you could understand what he was saying. Lucia not having a good grasp on the language as well spoke in sentences just like his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou missed a good scrap. Good thing this little knightress was there to protect her as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a knight.\u201d You defended</p><p>\u201cNone of that matters now.\u201dJorah interupted. \u201cThe longer we sit here bantering, the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion nodded before speaking himself \u201cHe\u2019s right. The dragon headed north. If we\u2019re going to find her that\u2019s where we\u2019ll have to go.\u201d </p><p>Tyrion stood from his sitting position on the steps and pulled up his breeches as you continued to sit.</p><p>\u201cWe? You\u2019re both Lannisters. The queen intends to remove power from your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we intend to help her do it.\u201d You stated standing up as well following your uncle down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been here for how many days now? I\u2019ve fought for her for years. Since she was little more than a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou betrayed her!\u201d Tyrion exclaimed</p><p>\u201cCareful now.\u201d Jorah warned</p><p>\u201cAnd she exiled you. Twice, I believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe second time thanks to you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame me for your crimes, Mormont!\u201d</p><p>Darrio stood and help his hand out to signal for Tyrion to stop speaking, he walked forward, stepping down a few steps</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right. Our queen exiled Jorah. And she\u2019s right Jorah saved her life. Perhaps she feels differently about him now. Perhaps not. The only way we\u2019ll know is if we ask her.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion rolled his eyes slightly </p><p>\u201cFine, fine. I suppose he can join us. Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I ever kill you, your eyes will be wide open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo death threats.\u201d You warned \u201cI heard enough of those from my brother when he was alive, I don\u2019t need it from someone like you, Jorah. Play nice.\u201d</p><p>Darrio gave you a thankful nod before looking at Tyrion \u201cForgive me, but why would we bring you? We\u2019re more likely to bring her.\u201d He said gesturing to you.</p><p>\u201cPardon me?\u201d You and Tyrion asked in unison.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever tracked animals in the wilderness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot precisely, but I have other skills that would be useful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have fought. I don\u2019t claim to be a great warrior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you good on a horse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiddling.\u201d Tyrion defended</p><p>\u201cSo mainly you talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn his defense, his talking got has gotten him out of many things. He\u2019s very persuasive and very convincing. However he also drinks. He\u2019s survived so far.\u201d You spoke up in defense stepping down another step</p><p>\u201cI do respect that, but would he not help us on this expedition. You would help us here in Meereen, though. None of us have experienced governing a city except for him. You want to prove your value to the queen? Prove it right here in Meereen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a foreign dwarf that barley speaks the language. Why would the Meerenese listen to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJorah, If I do recall correctly, Messandei knows the language very well, and has translated low Valyrian into High Valyrian and into the common tongue for the queen. I do believe if he needs help he can ask her. Other than that he is a very good advisor. If it weren\u2019t for him we would have lost the battle at Blackwater Bay.\u201d You said with furrowed brows. No one ever got away with belittling your family. Even if that family was annoying at times.</p><p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t listen to him, but they will listen to Grey Worm.\u201d</p><p>The man stepped forward \u201cI\u2019ll come with you. I\u2019ll find our queen.\u201d</p><p>Messandei stepped forward placing a hand on his chest in a worried manner. Much like how you would if someone you loved was hurt</p><p>\u201cYou are not strong enough to go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is. He\u2019s the toughest man with no balls I ever met. But you still can\u2019t go. The people believe in you. They now you speak for the queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. Only the Unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen. If you leave, half this city will consume the other half.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Missandei. Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei. Certainly not me. The queen\u2019s closest confidante, The commander of the Unsullied, A foreign dwarf with a scarred face, and a seasoned knightress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not leaving me here are you?\u201d You questioned with furrowed brows \u201cAlso, for the last time, I\u2019m not a knight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would serve as a Queen\u2019s Guard. If Tyrion is in charge, you protect him.\u201d</p><p>You nodded and gave him a small smile</p><p>\u201cGood fortune my friends. Meereen is ancient and glorious. Try not to ruin her. Look like it\u2019s you and me Jorah the Andal. Let\u2019s find some good horses. We have so much to talk about.\u201d Daario patted Jorah\u2019s shoulder then began to walk away from the thrones room and Jorah followed. Which left you, Tyrion, Missandei and Grey Worm.</p><p>You sat on the balcony of your chambers, glass of wine in hand as you looked over the sand. Jorah and Daario on their horses going to find Daenerys. </p><p>Queen\u2019s Guard. Who would\u2019ve thought that at age nineteen you\u2019d been in the ancient city of Meereen, in a downplayed dress than what you were used to wearing, Joffrey\u2019s sword strapped to your side and in the role of Queen\u2019s Guard to protect Tyrion while the queen was gone. </p><p>As a child you never thought you\u2019d leave King\u2019s Landing. Then you had gone to Winterfell. Stopping in the River Lands plenty of times on your way to the North. A place you wish you could go back to. A place you wish you could see Jon again. But he was in the Night\u2019s Watch, and from what you had heard by the little birds all around the world, he was making something of himself there. Lord Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch. One day, Lucia would get a kick out of that when you told her how he was when you first met him.</p><p>He was just the bastard boy of Winterfell. You were princess Y/N Baratheon of the Seven Kingdoms. You had a name, you had lands that belonged to Robert. And if it ever came down to it, you would have became queen. You would have had armies fighting for you if you ever commanded it. You knew she would one day wonder how a young fifteen year old you fell in love so quickly, for a boy who was only known as Ned Stark\u2019s bastard. You knew what you would one day tell her that nobody got to choose who they loved. </p><p>Your mother loved her brother. Robert Baratheon loved Lyanna Stark. Robb Stark loved a woman who wasn\u2019t his betrothed. And it got him killed. You fell for a northern boy. You weren\u2019t anything but children at the time. You had been so in love you never thought about how badly you\u2019d miss him. How bad this aching heart would feel. It was dull when you had fallen pregnant and when you had Lucia by your side. But now\u2026 Now that she wasn\u2019t by your side you felt your heart ache for her and her father.</p><p>\u201cMama!\u201d</p><p>You turned your head quickly. There she was. Her hair longer than before. The beautiful black curls of her father, her dark brown eyes that were so familiar, and the pale skin with her flush cheeks and nose. She had his nose. You\u2019d noticed this only now. </p><p>Her small dress fit her perfectly. A rarity for her, since she was still growing. The sound of her bare feet on the sound rang in your ears as she spotted you when Messandei brought her in. She was running to you arms out to be picked up. </p><p>You set down the wineglass walking with long strides to meet her in the middle. You grabbed her by her torso, picking her up and holding her. One hand rested on her bottom to keep her up and the other on the back of her head as her arms wrapped around your neck to hold you close. You buried your head into her shoulder getting the comforting smell of your daughter, who still smelled like firewood, a smell she had picked up when she found out she could touch fire without being hurt.</p><p>\u201cI missed you mama.\u201d You mumbled happily.</p><p>\u201cI missed you too Luci.\u201d You said using her nickname. </p><p>You looked at Messandei gratefully with a big smile as you sat down with her in your lap. She sat up straight and smiled at you real big and pointed to your dress.</p><p>\u201cPretty!\u201d She exclaimed happily. You laughed and nodded kissing her head forcefully </p><p>\u201cMessandei, thank you so much for bringing her to me.\u201d You said, tears in your eyes as he let a hand rest on the small of Lucia\u2019s back</p><p>Messandei smiled and nodded. \u201cThe man who had her, his name is Varys I beleive, Said she desperately wanted to see her mother. The way you had described her, matched her. So I brought her up here personally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell Varys thank you for me?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and went to leave. You looked down at Lucia and asked \u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><p>She held up three fingers excitedly </p><p>\u201cVarys says I\u2019m three!\u201d</p><p>You nodded and set her down on the ground. \u201cIt was your name day yesterday. What do you say\u2026 We go to the garden? Make a crown out of flowers for a brave little girl?\u201d</p><p>She nodded happily and you stood and took her hand walking out of the room and down the corridor.</p><p>You had a few roses, a couple of daises and a few small yellow ones. All of which were there to excentuate the pink roses you\u2019d found. You had her pick the daises and the nameless yellow ones, while you had picked and dethroned the roses. </p><p>\u201cMama?\u201d</p><p>You looked over to Lucia while you sat on the ground. She was standing twirling one of the dethroned roses in her hands while you held your dagger against a rose ready to take off yet another throne</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d You questioned</p><p>\u201cDo I have a papa?\u201d</p><p>You furrowed your brows in confusion. What had brought this on? She\u2019d never questioned you on such things before. She was usually so content with what she had. You and Tyrion, and Varys. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, my love?\u201d</p><p>She looked down at her feet almost embarrassed in a way as she seemed to be thinking. She was so young. Only the age of three, and she had so much on her plate already.</p><p>\u201cI saw others with their mamas and other people, Varys said the other people were their papas. Do I have one?\u201d</p><p>You smiled sadly and put down the rose and dagger holding a hand out for her to take. Her small hand took your larger one as you pulled her into your lap</p><p>\u201cYour papa, is the best man I ever met. He\u2019s strong, and he\u2019d love you to bits. Every inch of his being would go to loving you just like mine does.\u201d You said with a happy smile</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>You pushed a curl behind her ear and smiled once more.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s serving people. Keeping everyone safe. They call them the crows. Crows of the Night\u2019s Watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I be a crow?\u201d </p><p>Your face stiffened as you thought of what to say next. The Night\u2019s Watch didn\u2019t take girls. Let alone young girls who didn\u2019t know how to fight or could say the vows to become a brother of the Night\u2019s Watch. You supposed it would actually be sister of the Night\u2019s Watch.</p><p>\u201cMaybe one day. But today is not that day.\u201d You said firmly as you grabbed the rose and dagger again, dethroning it again and put into the crown.</p><p>\u201cBecause currently, you are Lucia of the houses Lannister and Stark. A brave little girl who made it miles from Volantis to Meereen just to get back to me.\u201d You said placing the crown on her head.</p><p>\u201cAnd one day, I\u2019ll take you to Castle Black, where your papa is. And you\u2019ll meet him.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a>@siennarothenburg <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57PumL3XTHKMbhaLBCDM6Q\" target=\"_blank\">@nighthood13</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzBlNV0PDM4SXm6Ym1PSJAw\" target=\"_blank\">@cevanstann</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/majsdnQ_JnelNmwA-W4FunA\" target=\"_blank\">@boredbrit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA_-qHoQbaPG0d8C94bexmA\" target=\"_blank\">@celestial-melancholy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrQghx2HTRQWATopqUw0s2w\" target=\"_blank\">@qhbr2013</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAeRnp4q0NBV8t7q1b6qpVw\" target=\"_blank\">@falling-stars-never-cry</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms0BdTYfmHt42bvH5n-1KJw\" target=\"_blank\">@vxidnik</a>@<a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/dashboard/blog/strangerthingsholland\" target=\"_blank\">strangerthingholland</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY2iDPZFAYSCyrTHvpHNOmQ\" target=\"_blank\">@awkwxrdmarauders</a>@tovloveliampayne <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmBZJJPECktMOQurgslNATQ\" target=\"_blank\">@veggidinosaurnuggets</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBWKqX0a6Xkb1gctJJJDd1g\" target=\"_blank\">@-thatgirloverthere-</a>@<a href=\"http://shieldgallovershieldgallover.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">shieldgallover</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQcJ41Q73x6-KoyP-pxsiLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@starkbelova</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9cgOoG0Hpcm0odEGY0N9og\" target=\"_blank\">@lightbeautysblog</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN3t6WpcWC8Luy-RdOQ5m1w\" target=\"_blank\">@sillyoldbeleh</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSjd3anGyRbLn0ViSUPR1bA\" target=\"_blank\">@emilielskov</a>@<a href=\"https://kayylluhh.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">kayylluhh</a>@<a href=\"https://honey-honey-boy.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">honey-honey-boy</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxYekjWCnH24z0QwoMRqFtg\" target=\"_blank\">@superbuckytrash</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkPX9bTS4_RT9JziquUBgpg\" target=\"_blank\">@camu-winchester</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY4tTcT1E_AqqiXU7UO0rUQ\" target=\"_blank\">@roger-bang-the-drum</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWMLSsKXRwPp1UkfyaHeR2g\" target=\"_blank\">@rebel4fandom</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg_AhM9FpeAUfhk1vcPXwQQ\" target=\"_blank\">@thegirlwithoutaname87</a> @megafandomfangirl <a>@nan-nie</a>\u200b<br></p></p>",

Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen. But we always want the wrong woman.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>You sighed slightly playing with hilt of your sword once again. Your thumb gazing over the red gem in the center that made it painfully obvious it was a Lannister\u2019s sword.</p><p>\u201cDoes he always talk so much?\u201d Darrio asked</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately.\u201d Is what you responded with, while Jorah only gave a small nod to confirm what you had said</p><p>The footsteps began as someone turned the corner. You looked up to see a man with bandages around his torso, he had a darker complexion. And Messandei who was with him, helping him along. </p><p>\u201cJorah the Andal.\u201d Is what he said to greet the knight.</p><p>\u201cTorgo Nudho.\u201d Jorah replied</p><p>\u201cHe should not be here.\u201d</p><p>You straightened your back slightly as Darrio began to speak in response \u201cNo, but he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur queen ordered him exiled from the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe saved our queen\u2019s life. IF it wasn\u2019t for him, we would have no queen, no chance to take back the seven kingdoms.\u201d You stated looking at the man who looked more like a boy.</p><p>Messandei turned to the man and spoke to him in Valayrian before she paused and looked at Tyrion before saying something else in Valayrian. To which Tyron responded and she then responded back to him, correcting his Valaryian.</p><p>\u201cSorry I not there to fight for our queen.\u201d </p><p>His common tongue wasn\u2019t the best, but you could understand what he was saying. Lucia not having a good grasp on the language as well spoke in sentences just like his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou missed a good scrap. Good thing this little knightress was there to protect her as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a knight.\u201d You defended</p><p>\u201cNone of that matters now.\u201dJorah interupted. \u201cThe longer we sit here bantering, the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion nodded before speaking himself \u201cHe\u2019s right. The dragon headed north. If we\u2019re going to find her that\u2019s where we\u2019ll have to go.\u201d </p><p>Tyrion stood from his sitting position on the steps and pulled up his breeches as you continued to sit.</p><p>\u201cWe? You\u2019re both Lannisters. The queen intends to remove power from your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we intend to help her do it.\u201d You stated standing up as well following your uncle down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been here for how many days now? I\u2019ve fought for her for years. Since she was little more than a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou betrayed her!\u201d Tyrion exclaimed</p><p>\u201cCareful now.\u201d Jorah warned</p><p>\u201cAnd she exiled you. Twice, I believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe second time thanks to you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame me for your crimes, Mormont!\u201d</p><p>Darrio stood and help his hand out to signal for Tyrion to stop speaking, he walked forward, stepping down a few steps</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right. Our queen exiled Jorah. And she\u2019s right Jorah saved her life. Perhaps she feels differently about him now. Perhaps not. The only way we\u2019ll know is if we ask her.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion rolled his eyes slightly </p><p>\u201cFine, fine. I suppose he can join us. Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I ever kill you, your eyes will be wide open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo death threats.\u201d You warned \u201cI heard enough of those from my brother when he was alive, I don\u2019t need it from someone like you, Jorah. Play nice.\u201d</p><p>Darrio gave you a thankful nod before looking at Tyrion \u201cForgive me, but why would we bring you? We\u2019re more likely to bring her.\u201d He said gesturing to you.</p><p>\u201cPardon me?\u201d You and Tyrion asked in unison.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever tracked animals in the wilderness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot precisely, but I have other skills that would be useful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have fought. I don\u2019t claim to be a great warrior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you good on a horse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiddling.\u201d Tyrion defended</p><p>\u201cSo mainly you talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn his defense, his talking got has gotten him out of many things. He\u2019s very persuasive and very convincing. However he also drinks. He\u2019s survived so far.\u201d You spoke up in defense stepping down another step</p><p>\u201cI do respect that, but would he not help us on this expedition. You would help us here in Meereen, though. None of us have experienced governing a city except for him. You want to prove your value to the queen? Prove it right here in Meereen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a foreign dwarf that barley speaks the language. Why would the Meerenese listen to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJorah, If I do recall correctly, Messandei knows the language very well, and has translated low Valyrian into High Valyrian and into the common tongue for the queen. I do believe if he needs help he can ask her. Other than that he is a very good advisor. If it weren\u2019t for him we would have lost the battle at Blackwater Bay.\u201d You said with furrowed brows. No one ever got away with belittling your family. Even if that family was annoying at times.</p><p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t listen to him, but they will listen to Grey Worm.\u201d</p><p>The man stepped forward \u201cI\u2019ll come with you. I\u2019ll find our queen.\u201d</p><p>Messandei stepped forward placing a hand on his chest in a worried manner. Much like how you would if someone you loved was hurt</p><p>\u201cYou are not strong enough to go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is. He\u2019s the toughest man with no balls I ever met. But you still can\u2019t go. The people believe in you. They now you speak for the queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. Only the Unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen. If you leave, half this city will consume the other half.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Missandei. Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei. Certainly not me. The queen\u2019s closest confidante, The commander of the Unsullied, A foreign dwarf with a scarred face, and a seasoned knightress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not leaving me here are you?\u201d You questioned with furrowed brows \u201cAlso, for the last time, I\u2019m not a knight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would serve as a Queen\u2019s Guard. If Tyrion is in charge, you protect him.\u201d</p><p>You nodded and gave him a small smile</p><p>\u201cGood fortune my friends. Meereen is ancient and glorious. Try not to ruin her. Look like it\u2019s you and me Jorah the Andal. Let\u2019s find some good horses. We have so much to talk about.\u201d Daario patted Jorah\u2019s shoulder then began to walk away from the thrones room and Jorah followed. Which left you, Tyrion, Missandei and Grey Worm.</p><p>You sat on the balcony of your chambers, glass of wine in hand as you looked over the sand. Jorah and Daario on their horses going to find Daenerys. </p><p>Queen\u2019s Guard. Who would\u2019ve thought that at age nineteen you\u2019d been in the ancient city of Meereen, in a downplayed dress than what you were used to wearing, Joffrey\u2019s sword strapped to your side and in the role of Queen\u2019s Guard to protect Tyrion while the queen was gone. </p><p>As a child you never thought you\u2019d leave King\u2019s Landing. Then you had gone to Winterfell. Stopping in the River Lands plenty of times on your way to the North. A place you wish you could go back to. A place you wish you could see Jon again. But he was in the Night\u2019s Watch, and from what you had heard by the little birds all around the world, he was making something of himself there. Lord Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch. One day, Lucia would get a kick out of that when you told her how he was when you first met him.</p><p>He was just the bastard boy of Winterfell. You were princess Y/N Baratheon of the Seven Kingdoms. You had a name, you had lands that belonged to Robert. And if it ever came down to it, you would have became queen. You would have had armies fighting for you if you ever commanded it. You knew she would one day wonder how a young fifteen year old you fell in love so quickly, for a boy who was only known as Ned Stark\u2019s bastard. You knew what you would one day tell her that nobody got to choose who they loved. </p><p>Your mother loved her brother. Robert Baratheon loved Lyanna Stark. Robb Stark loved a woman who wasn\u2019t his betrothed. And it got him killed. You fell for a northern boy. You weren\u2019t anything but children at the time. You had been so in love you never thought about how badly you\u2019d miss him. How bad this aching heart would feel. It was dull when you had fallen pregnant and when you had Lucia by your side. But now\u2026 Now that she wasn\u2019t by your side you felt your heart ache for her and her father.</p><p>\u201cMama!\u201d</p><p>You turned your head quickly. There she was. Her hair longer than before. The beautiful black curls of her father, her dark brown eyes that were so familiar, and the pale skin with her flush cheeks and nose. She had his nose. You\u2019d noticed this only now. </p><p>Her small dress fit her perfectly. A rarity for her, since she was still growing. The sound of her bare feet on the sound rang in your ears as she spotted you when Messandei brought her in. She was running to you arms out to be picked up. </p><p>You set down the wineglass walking with long strides to meet her in the middle. You grabbed her by her torso, picking her up and holding her. One hand rested on her bottom to keep her up and the other on the back of her head as her arms wrapped around your neck to hold you close. You buried your head into her shoulder getting the comforting smell of your daughter, who still smelled like firewood, a smell she had picked up when she found out she could touch fire without being hurt.</p><p>\u201cI missed you mama.\u201d You mumbled happily.</p><p>\u201cI missed you too Luci.\u201d You said using her nickname. </p><p>You looked at Messandei gratefully with a big smile as you sat down with her in your lap. She sat up straight and smiled at you real big and pointed to your dress.</p><p>\u201cPretty!\u201d She exclaimed happily. You laughed and nodded kissing her head forcefully </p><p>\u201cMessandei, thank you so much for bringing her to me.\u201d You said, tears in your eyes as he let a hand rest on the small of Lucia\u2019s back</p><p>Messandei smiled and nodded. \u201cThe man who had her, his name is Varys I beleive, Said she desperately wanted to see her mother. The way you had described her, matched her. So I brought her up here personally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell Varys thank you for me?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and went to leave. You looked down at Lucia and asked \u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><p>She held up three fingers excitedly </p><p>\u201cVarys says I\u2019m three!\u201d</p><p>You nodded and set her down on the ground. \u201cIt was your name day yesterday. What do you say\u2026 We go to the garden? Make a crown out of flowers for a brave little girl?\u201d</p><p>She nodded happily and you stood and took her hand walking out of the room and down the corridor.</p><p>You had a few roses, a couple of daises and a few small yellow ones. All of which were there to excentuate the pink roses you\u2019d found. You had her pick the daises and the nameless yellow ones, while you had picked and dethroned the roses. </p><p>\u201cMama?\u201d</p><p>You looked over to Lucia while you sat on the ground. She was standing twirling one of the dethroned roses in her hands while you held your dagger against a rose ready to take off yet another throne</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d You questioned</p><p>\u201cDo I have a papa?\u201d</p><p>You furrowed your brows in confusion. What had brought this on? She\u2019d never questioned you on such things before. She was usually so content with what she had. You and Tyrion, and Varys. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, my love?\u201d</p><p>She looked down at her feet almost embarrassed in a way as she seemed to be thinking. She was so young. Only the age of three, and she had so much on her plate already.</p><p>\u201cI saw others with their mamas and other people, Varys said the other people were their papas. Do I have one?\u201d</p><p>You smiled sadly and put down the rose and dagger holding a hand out for her to take. Her small hand took your larger one as you pulled her into your lap</p><p>\u201cYour papa, is the best man I ever met. He\u2019s strong, and he\u2019d love you to bits. Every inch of his being would go to loving you just like mine does.\u201d You said with a happy smile</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>You pushed a curl behind her ear and smiled once more.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s serving people. Keeping everyone safe. They call them the crows. Crows of the Night\u2019s Watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I be a crow?\u201d </p><p>Your face stiffened as you thought of what to say next. The Night\u2019s Watch didn\u2019t take girls. Let alone young girls who didn\u2019t know how to fight or could say the vows to become a brother of the Night\u2019s Watch. You supposed it would actually be sister of the Night\u2019s Watch.</p><p>\u201cMaybe one day. But today is not that day.\u201d You said firmly as you grabbed the rose and dagger again, dethroning it again and put into the crown.</p><p>\u201cBecause currently, you are Lucia of the houses Lannister and Stark. A brave little girl who made it miles from Volantis to Meereen just to get back to me.\u201d You said placing the crown on her head.</p><p>\u201cAnd one day, I\u2019ll take you to Castle Black, where your papa is. And you\u2019ll meet him.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a>@siennarothenburg <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57PumL3XTHKMbhaLBCDM6Q\" target=\"_blank\">@nighthood13</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzBlNV0PDM4SXm6Ym1PSJAw\" target=\"_blank\">@cevanstann</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/majsdnQ_JnelNmwA-W4FunA\" target=\"_blank\">@boredbrit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA_-qHoQbaPG0d8C94bexmA\" target=\"_blank\">@celestial-melancholy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrQghx2HTRQWATopqUw0s2w\" target=\"_blank\">@qhbr2013</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAeRnp4q0NBV8t7q1b6qpVw\" target=\"_blank\">@falling-stars-never-cry</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms0BdTYfmHt42bvH5n-1KJw\" target=\"_blank\">@vxidnik</a>@<a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/dashboard/blog/strangerthingsholland\" target=\"_blank\">strangerthingholland</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY2iDPZFAYSCyrTHvpHNOmQ\" target=\"_blank\">@awkwxrdmarauders</a>@tovloveliampayne <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmBZJJPECktMOQurgslNATQ\" target=\"_blank\">@veggidinosaurnuggets</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBWKqX0a6Xkb1gctJJJDd1g\" target=\"_blank\">@-thatgirloverthere-</a>@<a href=\"http://shieldgallovershieldgallover.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">shieldgallover</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQcJ41Q73x6-KoyP-pxsiLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@starkbelova</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9cgOoG0Hpcm0odEGY0N9og\" target=\"_blank\">@lightbeautysblog</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN3t6WpcWC8Luy-RdOQ5m1w\" target=\"_blank\">@sillyoldbeleh</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSjd3anGyRbLn0ViSUPR1bA\" target=\"_blank\">@emilielskov</a>@<a href=\"https://kayylluhh.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">kayylluhh</a>@<a href=\"https://honey-honey-boy.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">honey-honey-boy</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxYekjWCnH24z0QwoMRqFtg\" target=\"_blank\">@superbuckytrash</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkPX9bTS4_RT9JziquUBgpg\" target=\"_blank\">@camu-winchester</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY4tTcT1E_AqqiXU7UO0rUQ\" target=\"_blank\">@roger-bang-the-drum</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWMLSsKXRwPp1UkfyaHeR2g\" target=\"_blank\">@rebel4fandom</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg_AhM9FpeAUfhk1vcPXwQQ\" target=\"_blank\">@thegirlwithoutaname87</a> @megafandomfangirl <a>@nan-nie</a>\u200b<br></p></p>",

He&rsquo;s the toughest man with no balls I ever met. But you still can&rsquo;t go. The people believe in you. They now you speak for the queen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true. Only the Unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen. If you leave, half this city will consume the other half.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And Missandei. Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei. Certainly not me. The queen&rsquo;s closest confidante, The commander of the Unsullied, A foreign dwarf with a scarred face, and a seasoned knightress.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not leaving me here are you?&rdquo; You questioned with furrowed brows &ldquo;Also, for the last time, I&rsquo;m not a knight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You would serve as a Queen&rsquo;s Guard. If Tyrion is in charge, you protect him.&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded and gave him a small smile</p><p>&ldquo;Good fortune my friends. Meereen is ancient and glorious. Try not to ruin her. Look like it&rsquo;s you and me Jorah the Andal. Let&rsquo;s find some good horses. We have so much to talk about.&rdquo; Daario patted Jorah&rsquo;s shoulder then began to walk away from the thrones room and Jorah followed. Which left you, Tyrion, Missandei and Grey Worm.</p><p>You sat on the balcony of your chambers, glass of wine in hand as you looked over the sand. Jorah and Daario on their horses going to find Daenerys. </p><p>Queen&rsquo;s Guard. Who would&rsquo;ve thought that at age nineteen you&rsquo;d been in the ancient city of Meereen, in a downplayed dress than what you were used to wearing, Joffrey&rsquo;s sword strapped to your side and in the role of Queen&rsquo;s Guard to protect Tyrion while the queen was gone. </p><p>As a child you never thought you&rsquo;d leave King&rsquo;s Landing. Then you had gone to Winterfell. Stopping in the River Lands plenty of times on your way to the North. A place you wish you could go back to. A place you wish you could see Jon again. But he was in the Night&rsquo;s Watch, and from what you had heard by the little birds all around the world, he was making something of himself there. Lord Commander of the Night&rsquo;s Watch. One day, Lucia would get a kick out of that when you told her how he was when you first met him.</p><p>He was just the bastard boy of Winterfell. You were princess Y/N Baratheon of the Seven Kingdoms. You had a name, you had lands that belonged to Robert. And if it ever came down to it, you would have became queen. You would have had armies fighting for you if you ever commanded it. You knew she would one day wonder how a young fifteen year old you fell in love so quickly, for a boy who was only known as Ned Stark&rsquo;s bastard. You knew what you would one day tell her that nobody got to choose who they loved. </p><p>Your mother loved her brother. Robert Baratheon loved Lyanna Stark. Robb Stark loved a woman who wasn&rsquo;t his betrothed. And it got him killed. You fell for a northern boy. You weren&rsquo;t anything but children at the time. You had been so in love you never thought about how badly you&rsquo;d miss him. How bad this aching heart would feel. It was dull when you had fallen pregnant and when you had Lucia by your side. But now&hellip; Now that she wasn&rsquo;t by your side you felt your heart ache for her and her father.</p><p>&ldquo;Mama!&rdquo;</p><p>You turned your head quickly. There she was. Her hair longer than before. The beautiful black curls of her father, her dark brown eyes that were so familiar, and the pale skin with her flush cheeks and nose. She had his nose. You&rsquo;d noticed this only now. </p><p>Her small dress fit her perfectly. A rarity for her, since she was still growing. The sound of her bare feet on the sound rang in your ears as she spotted you when Messandei brought her in. She was running to you arms out to be picked up. </p><p>You set down the wineglass walking with long strides to meet her in the middle. You grabbed her by her torso, picking her up and holding her. One hand rested on her bottom to keep her up and the other on the back of her head as her arms wrapped around your neck to hold you close. You buried your head into her shoulder getting the comforting smell of your daughter, who still smelled like firewood, a smell she had picked up when she found out she could touch fire without being hurt.</p><p>&ldquo;I missed you mama.&rdquo; You mumbled happily.</p><p>&ldquo;I missed you too Luci.&rdquo; You said using her nickname. </p><p>You looked at Messandei gratefully with a big smile as you sat down with her in your lap. She sat up straight and smiled at you real big and pointed to your dress.</p><p>&ldquo;Pretty!&rdquo; She exclaimed happily. You laughed and nodded kissing her head forcefully </p><p>&ldquo;Messandei, thank you so much for bringing her to me.&rdquo; You said, tears in your eyes as he let a hand rest on the small of Lucia&rsquo;s back</p><p>Messandei smiled and nodded. &ldquo;The man who had her, his name is Varys I beleive, Said she desperately wanted to see her mother. The way you had described her, matched her. So I brought her up here personally.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell Varys thank you for me?&rdquo;</p><p>She nodded and went to leave. You looked down at Lucia and asked &ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo;</p><p>She held up three fingers excitedly </p><p>&ldquo;Varys says I&rsquo;m three!&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded and set her down on the ground. &ldquo;It was your name day yesterday. What do you say&hellip; We go to the garden? Make a crown out of flowers for a brave little girl?&rdquo;</p><p>She nodded happily and you stood and took her hand walking out of the room and down the corridor.</p><p>You had a few roses, a couple of daises and a few small yellow ones. All of which were there to excentuate the pink roses you&rsquo;d found. You had her pick the daises and the nameless yellow ones, while you had picked and dethroned the roses. </p><p>&ldquo;Mama?&rdquo;</p><p>You looked over to Lucia while you sat on the ground. She was standing twirling one of the dethroned roses in her hands while you held your dagger against a rose ready to take off yet another throne</p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; You questioned</p><p>&ldquo;Do I have a papa?&rdquo;</p><p>You furrowed your brows in confusion. What had brought this on? She&rsquo;d never questioned you on such things before. She was usually so content with what she had. You and Tyrion, and Varys. </p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean, my love?&rdquo;</p><p>She looked down at her feet almost embarrassed in a way as she seemed to be thinking. She was so young. Only the age of three, and she had so much on her plate already.</p><p>&ldquo;I saw others with their mamas and other people, Varys said the other people were their papas. Do I have one?&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled sadly and put down the rose and dagger holding a hand out for her to take. Her small hand took your larger one as you pulled her into your lap</p><p>&ldquo;Your papa, is the best man I ever met. He&rsquo;s strong, and he&rsquo;d love you to bits. Every inch of his being would go to loving you just like mine does.&rdquo; You said with a happy smile</p><p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p><p>You pushed a curl behind her ear and smiled once more.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s serving people. Keeping everyone safe. They call them the crows. Crows of the Night&rsquo;s Watch.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can I be a crow?&rdquo; </p><p>Your face stiffened as you thought of what to say next. The Night&rsquo;s Watch didn&rsquo;t take girls. Let alone young girls who didn&rsquo;t know how to fight or could say the vows to become a brother of the Night&rsquo;s Watch. You supposed it would actually be sister of the Night&rsquo;s Watch.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe one day. But today is not that day.&rdquo; You said firmly as you grabbed the rose and dagger again, dethroning it again and put into the crown.</p><p>&ldquo;Because currently, you are Lucia of the houses Lannister and Stark. A brave little girl who made it miles from Volantis to Meereen just to get back to me.&rdquo; You said placing the crown on her head.</p><p>&ldquo;And one day, I&rsquo;ll take you to Castle Black, where your papa is. And you&rsquo;ll meet him.&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a>@siennarothenburg <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57PumL3XTHKMbhaLBCDM6Q\" target=\"_blank\">@nighthood13</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzBlNV0PDM4SXm6Ym1PSJAw\" target=\"_blank\">@cevanstann</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/majsdnQ_JnelNmwA-W4FunA\" target=\"_blank\">@boredbrit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA_-qHoQbaPG0d8C94bexmA\" target=\"_blank\">@celestial-melancholy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrQghx2HTRQWATopqUw0s2w\" target=\"_blank\">@qhbr2013</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAeRnp4q0NBV8t7q1b6qpVw\" target=\"_blank\">@falling-stars-never-cry</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms0BdTYfmHt42bvH5n-1KJw\" target=\"_blank\">@vxidnik</a>@<a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/dashboard/blog/strangerthingsholland\" target=\"_blank\">strangerthingholland</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY2iDPZFAYSCyrTHvpHNOmQ\" target=\"_blank\">@awkwxrdmarauders</a>@tovloveliampayne <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmBZJJPECktMOQurgslNATQ\" target=\"_blank\">@veggidinosaurnuggets</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBWKqX0a6Xkb1gctJJJDd1g\" target=\"_blank\">@-thatgirloverthere-</a>@<a href=\"http://shieldgallovershieldgallover.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">shieldgallover</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQcJ41Q73x6-KoyP-pxsiLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@starkbelova</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9cgOoG0Hpcm0odEGY0N9og\" target=\"_blank\">@lightbeautysblog</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN3t6WpcWC8Luy-RdOQ5m1w\" target=\"_blank\">@sillyoldbeleh</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSjd3anGyRbLn0ViSUPR1bA\" target=\"_blank\">@emilielskov</a>@<a href=\"https://kayylluhh.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">kayylluhh</a>@<a href=\"https://honey-honey-boy.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">honey-honey-boy</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxYekjWCnH24z0QwoMRqFtg\" target=\"_blank\">@superbuckytrash</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkPX9bTS4_RT9JziquUBgpg\" target=\"_blank\">@camu-winchester</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY4tTcT1E_AqqiXU7UO0rUQ\" target=\"_blank\">@roger-bang-the-drum</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWMLSsKXRwPp1UkfyaHeR2g\" target=\"_blank\">@rebel4fandom</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg_AhM9FpeAUfhk1vcPXwQQ\" target=\"_blank\">@thegirlwithoutaname87</a> @megafandomfangirl <a>@nan-nie</a>&#8203;<br /></p></p>",

The arena was huge. It was the largest fighting pit you\u2019d ever seen. People from Meereen were hip to hip as they sat waiting for the fighting to start.</p><p>Daenerys had been kind to you. Asking the Unsullied to keep an eye out for a toddler with dark curly hair, pale skin and dark brown eyes. She seemed understanding of the situation you were in. The desperation you had to get Lucia back in your arms safely.</p><!-- more --><p>The cut had mostly healed, it was almost a large scar on your face. And when you had looked in the mirror you couldn\u2019t recognize yourself. You remembered once looking in a mirror and seeing a fresh still child like face, full of innocence. A face that had been yours. Tan skin and \u00a0golden hair. Now, you looked older, more worn and more hardened. You weren\u2019t the fifteen year old girl who believed that Robert Baratheon was your father. You were nineteen. In that time you\u2019d had a baby. You\u2019d killed someone. You\u2019d killed your brother and you still hadn\u2019t told anyone. </p><p>This pit reminded you of Joffrey. He would have loved this. A giant arena to look down at people slaughtering each other. \u00a0You remembered the wooden sword fighting Robert had discouraged from you. Something he\u2019d told you not to do. </p><p>Now look where you were. In front of a queen, Joffrey\u2019s sword strapped to your waist, a gentle reminder of what you had allowed yourself to do. You hadn\u2019t imagined that the poison would be as gruesome as it had been. You had felt like you betrayed the person your brother had been. When he was kind to you.</p><p>Daenerys\u2019s betrothed walked around and sat next to Daenerys. Fixing his yellow garments of clothing before settling into a position to sit in.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d </p><p>\u201cJust making sure everything is in order.\u201d He responded to her. </p><p>You furrowed your brows slightly. What did he have to do? Wasn\u2019t everything already in order? It should have been. From what you understood, these kind of things were usually sorted out the few nights before hand. So nothing went awry.</p><p>Daenerys seemed to think this was strange as well, she looked at him questionably as did you. She then looked back to the pit where the gates opened and horses came stampeding across and through another gate, a man following behind on the ground.</p><p>People stood applauding and cheering as he came to the center of the pit and faced the Queen of Meereen. He then held his arm out in a straight line and turned, the entire audience quieted up as he then began to speak in Valyrian. It was a language you didn\u2019t know, let alone understand.</p><p>Once he was finished speaking the crowd began to cheer and applaud once more. Just resuming what they\u2019d been doing before hand.</p><p>Two men came out with weapons in hand and stood beside the previous man. Their armor wasn\u2019t even armor and you didn\u2019t recognize their faces. You doubted you\u2019d be able to from where you sat anyway.</p><p>The two men stepped froward and said the exact same thing in Valyrian and then stopped speaking. As if&hellip; waiting for something to happen.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re waiting for you.\u201d Her betrothed said factually. When Daenerys looked at him confused he added \u201cClap your hands.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys raised her hands reluctantly and clapped. The entire crowd began cheering once more. The two men began fighting. You hated this. Killing wasn\u2019t a sport. Joffrey had made it a sport. And when Gregor Clegane stabbed a men through the throat at a jousting match it was like he was suddenly in love with the sport.</p><p>\u201cYou should bet on the smaller man. No question, that\u2019s where you should put your money.\u201d Darrio said coming up close to the queen.</p><p>\u201cThe smaller man it is.\u201d Tyrion responded</p><p>\u201cTyrion.\u201d You grumbled playing with the hilt of your sword, tracing the intricate details that had been put into the mold. There was one thing you had to commend your grandfather for, it was his eye for detail and how certain things should look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not putting my money anywhere.\u201d Daenerys responded</p><p>\u201cKings and queens never bet on the games. Perhaps you should go and find someone who does.\u201d</p><p>The two got into a large conversation, many things that you didn\u2019t pay any attention to. Your mind kept going to your brother. You didn\u2019t know why it did. You hadn\u2019t thought about him in months. But now you were.</p><p>You could remember a lot of things about him. How he had looked at you when you had been hiding in a pantry in the kitchens together eating some of the cakes that was made in honor of Tommen\u2019s birth. How he had smiled at you when you handed him one of the cakes.</p><p>You also could remember how he looked at you when you were able to walk again after giving birth. It wasn\u2019t distaste like it had been once before, when he had locked you in your chambers. Maybe it had been pity. Something that had gone away quickly. That much was sure.</p><p>You were snapped out of your thoughts when you heard the sound of a sword going through someone\u2019s neck. </p><p>You could practically see it. You could feel it. Your bare feet against the material of a stone cold stage outside the sept. And Sansa\u2019s grateful expression. And then the sound of his head hitting the ground. </p><p>Your mother\u2019s arms wrapping around you to keep you from attacking Joffrey. The sound of Sansa falling to ground as she fainted. The heavy weight of your stomach as you fell to your knees.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t that. It was a fighting pit. It wasn\u2019t Ned Stark\u2019s head that had been cut off. It was the head of the loosing fighter.</p><p>The sound of the crows cheering came back into focus as Tyrion shook your shoulder. \u201cY/N? Y/N? Are you alright?\u201d</p><p>Your head snapped over to Tyrion. Your eyes were wide as you remembered what had happened. You didn\u2019t even realize it was something you had been trying to forget until now. You had forgotten, you had forgotten that you tried to fight Joffrey as Illyn Payne went to get Ned Stark\u2019s sword. </p><p>His worried face remained when he saw the almost traumatized look on your face. The look of someone who\u2019s seen death. You\u2019ve seen it plenty he knew that. He knew you hated killing for sport, and killing that was useless.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d You choked out grabbing onto the armrest of your seat. Tyrion however seemed unconvinced, but he dropped the matter.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t approve?\u201d Hizdhar asked Tyrion as you tried to regulate your breathing into a normal pace.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. I can do without it in my leisure time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. Yet it\u2019s an unpleasant question, but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to confuse what is with what ought to be, especially when what is has worked in your favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about myself. I\u2019m talking about the necessary conditions for greatness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is greatness?\u201d Daenerys questioned </p><p>\u201cThat is a vital part of the great city of Meereen, which existed long before you or I and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father would have liked you.\u201d Tyrion mumbled</p><p>When the next fighters were brought out your face dropped. For fucks sake Jorah. Is all you could think. Tyrion had gotten him out of the city without being killed. Now he decided to come back. You understood why. But you didn\u2019t understand why he had decided to go into the fighting pits once again.</p><p>You wanted to hold your breath and pretend he wasn\u2019t down there. But when Daenerys clapped her hands you knew he\u2019d win. He was a knight of Westeros.</p><p>Jorah fought and killed. Until there was only three left he could fight. You closed your eyes as you heard the fighting. Useless fighting. Fighting that wouldn\u2019t do anything for anybody. Harming and killing for sport. You hadn\u2019t realized people other than Joffrey had enjoyed it.</p><p>\u201cYou can end this!\u201d Tyrion said. Leaning forward in his chair</p><p>\u201cShe cannot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can.\u201d</p><p>You opened your eyes again to see Jorah, back on the ground a sword pointing to him. He couldn\u2019t die. Not now. Not Today.</p><p>One of the men put their sword through the other\u2019s back and he fell to the ground in pain. It gave him enough time to grab his own weapon and get ready for the next fight. You closed your eyes again. Not wanting to see what was happening.</p><p>Eventually your ears were greeted with booing. Opening your eyes once more you saw Jorah. Standing tall and the man he\u2019d been ready to fight on the ground, severely wounded.</p><p>Jorah grabbed his spear and aimed it like he was about to throw it. But it was aimed towards the seating area that you all sat at.</p><p>You moved quickly to avoid it and fell the ground by the pillar. The spear had flew from Jorah&rsquo;s hand and into the chest of a man with a golden mask. Someone who hadn\u2019t been there before. Had he been trying to sneak up on Daenerys?</p><p>You looked around and suddenly men with similar masks started standing from the crowd. You pushed yourself from the ground. They had begun to chant something in Valyrian. You pulled your sword from it\u2019s sheath and got into a defensive position. You walked to be in front of the queen. You didn\u2019t know if it was part of your instinct telling you to protect her.</p><p>\u201cProtect you queen!\u201d Darrio shouted. You watched as the men in masks began to kill citizens in the crowd, slitting their throats and stabbing them to death. People tried scrambling away and running. Some got away, some did not.</p><p>\u201cYour grace! Come with me! I know a way\u2014\u201c He had been interrupted by one of the men stabbing him through the heart with a dagger.</p><p>One of the men went towards Darrio and the other to you. You hadn\u2019t hesitated to put a sword through his throat. You pulled the sword out of his throat, it had been covered in his blood. But you didn\u2019t even bat an eye.</p><p>Jorah had gotten up to where you all were and went to Daenerys holding his hand out for her to take. And she did. He took her to get her out of the massacre that was happening. You followed them closely behind as Jorah helped lower her into the fighting pit.

But the wooden gate had been closed and a man in a golden mask stepped forward ready to fight as well. Jorah stabbed him through the stomach as Darrio said \u201cThe other side, follow me!\u201d</p><p>When Messandei and Tyrion ran towards you all Daenerys took Messandei\u2019s hand and kept running to the other side. Unsullied circling you all as you continued to run. You all came to a sudden stop as more of the men ran through the tunnel you had been running to. You all stood. In a circle as they surrounded you all. The unsullied was all that was holding them back.</p><p>You felt your heart stop when a roar ripped through the air. It wasn\u2019t something you\u2019d ever heard before. Everyone stopped fighting and froze. Looking up at the sky. It was a dragon?</p><p>All was quiet until a gust of fire went through the air and large dark colored dragon flew through it. The men began to run to leave, as the dragon circled around the arena.

The dragon then turned to her, angry and began to roar loudly in her face. Her hair being sept behind her shoulders from the amount of force. But when he stopped she reached her hand out before more men threw spears making the dragon yell in pain.</p><p>You watched Daenerys as she climbed onto Drogon\u2019s back. When she whispered something to the dragon he began to march forward. You grabbed Messandei by the hand pulling her out of the way and watched as Daenerys\u2019s dragon took air with her on his back. Flying out of the arena.</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a>@siennarothenburg <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57PumL3XTHKMbhaLBCDM6Q\" target=\"_blank\">@nighthood13</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzBlNV0PDM4SXm6Ym1PSJAw\" target=\"_blank\">@cevanstann</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/majsdnQ_JnelNmwA-W4FunA\" target=\"_blank\">@boredbrit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA_-qHoQbaPG0d8C94bexmA\" target=\"_blank\">@celestial-melancholy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrQghx2HTRQWATopqUw0s2w\" target=\"_blank\">@qhbr2013</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAeRnp4q0NBV8t7q1b6qpVw\" target=\"_blank\">@falling-stars-never-cry</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms0BdTYfmHt42bvH5n-1KJw\" target=\"_blank\">@vxidnik</a>@<a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/dashboard/blog/strangerthingsholland\" target=\"_blank\">strangerthingholland</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY2iDPZFAYSCyrTHvpHNOmQ\" target=\"_blank\">@awkwxrdmarauders</a>@tovloveliampayne <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmBZJJPECktMOQurgslNATQ\" target=\"_blank\">@veggidinosaurnuggets</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBWKqX0a6Xkb1gctJJJDd1g\" target=\"_blank\">@-thatgirloverthere-</a>@<a href=\"http://shieldgallovershieldgallover.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">shieldgallover</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQcJ41Q73x6-KoyP-pxsiLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@starkbelova</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9cgOoG0Hpcm0odEGY0N9og\" target=\"_blank\">@lightbeautysblog</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN3t6WpcWC8Luy-RdOQ5m1w\" target=\"_blank\">@sillyoldbeleh</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSjd3anGyRbLn0ViSUPR1bA\" target=\"_blank\">@emilielskov</a>@<a href=\"https://kayylluhh.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">kayylluhh</a>@<a href=\"https://honey-honey-boy.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">honey-honey-boy</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxYekjWCnH24z0QwoMRqFtg\" target=\"_blank\">@superbuckytrash</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkPX9bTS4_RT9JziquUBgpg\" target=\"_blank\">@camu-winchester</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY4tTcT1E_AqqiXU7UO0rUQ\" target=\"_blank\">@roger-bang-the-drum</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWMLSsKXRwPp1UkfyaHeR2g\" target=\"_blank\">@rebel4fandom</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg_AhM9FpeAUfhk1vcPXwQQ\" target=\"_blank\">@thegirlwithoutaname87</a> @megafandomfangirl <a>@nan-nie</a>\u200b<br/></p>",

Asking the Unsullied to keep an eye out for a toddler with dark curly hair, pale skin and dark brown eyes. She seemed understanding of the situation you were in. The desperation you had to get Lucia back in your arms safely.</p>[[MORE]]<p>The cut had mostly healed, it was almost a large scar on your face. And when you had looked in the mirror you couldn\u2019t recognize yourself. You remembered once looking in a mirror and seeing a fresh still child like face, full of innocence. A face that had been yours. Tan skin and \u00a0golden hair. Now, you looked older, more worn and more hardened. You weren\u2019t the fifteen year old girl who believed that Robert Baratheon was your father. You were nineteen. In that time you\u2019d had a baby. You\u2019d killed someone. You\u2019d killed your brother and you still hadn\u2019t told anyone. </p><p>This pit reminded you of Joffrey. He would have loved this. A giant arena to look down at people slaughtering each other. \u00a0You remembered the wooden sword fighting Robert had discouraged from you. Something he\u2019d told you not to do. </p><p>Now look where you were. In front of a queen, Joffrey\u2019s sword strapped to your waist, a gentle reminder of what you had allowed yourself to do. You hadn\u2019t imagined that the poison would be as gruesome as it had been. You had felt like you betrayed the person your brother had been. When he was kind to you.</p><p>Daenerys\u2019s betrothed walked around and sat next to Daenerys. Fixing his yellow garments of clothing before settling into a position to sit in.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d </p><p>\u201cJust making sure everything is in order.\u201d He responded to her. </p><p>You furrowed your brows slightly. What did he have to do? Wasn\u2019t everything already in order? It should have been. From what you understood, these kind of things were usually sorted out the few nights before hand. So nothing went awry.</p><p>Daenerys seemed to think this was strange as well, she looked at him questionably as did you. She then looked back to the pit where the gates opened and horses came stampeding across and through another gate, a man following behind on the ground.</p><p>People stood applauding and cheering as he came to the center of the pit and faced the Queen of Meereen. He then held his arm out in a straight line and turned, the entire audience quieted up as he then began to speak in Valyrian. It was a language you didn\u2019t know, let alone understand.</p><p>Once he was finished speaking the crowd began to cheer and applaud once more. Just resuming what they\u2019d been doing before hand.</p><p>Two men came out with weapons in hand and stood beside the previous man. Their armor wasn\u2019t even armor and you didn\u2019t recognize their faces. You doubted you\u2019d be able to from where you sat anyway.</p><p>The two men stepped froward and said the exact same thing in Valyrian and then stopped speaking. As if\u2026 waiting for something to happen.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re waiting for you.\u201d Her betrothed said factually. When Daenerys looked at him confused he added \u201cClap your hands.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys raised her hands reluctantly and clapped. The entire crowd began cheering once more. The two men began fighting. You hated this. Killing wasn\u2019t a sport. Joffrey had made it a sport. And when Gregor Clegane stabbed a men through the throat at a jousting match it was like he was suddenly in love with the sport.</p><p>\u201cYou should bet on the smaller man. No question, that\u2019s where you should put your money.\u201d Darrio said coming up close to the queen.</p><p>\u201cThe smaller man it is.\u201d Tyrion responded</p><p>\u201cTyrion.\u201d You grumbled playing with the hilt of your sword, tracing the intricate details that had been put into the mold. There was one thing you had to commend your grandfather for, it was his eye for detail and how certain things should look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not putting my money anywhere.\u201d Daenerys responded</p><p>\u201cKings and queens never bet on the games. Perhaps you should go and find someone who does.\u201d</p><p>The two got into a large conversation, many things that you didn\u2019t pay any attention to. Your mind kept going to your brother. You didn\u2019t know why it did. You hadn\u2019t thought about him in months. But now you were.</p><p>You could remember a lot of things about him. How he had looked at you when you had been hiding in a pantry in the kitchens together eating some of the cakes that was made in honor of Tommen\u2019s birth. How he had smiled at you when you handed him one of the cakes.</p><p>You also could remember how he looked at you when you were able to walk again after giving birth. It wasn\u2019t distaste like it had been once before, when he had locked you in your chambers. Maybe it had been pity. Something that had gone away quickly. That much was sure.</p><p>You were snapped out of your thoughts when you heard the sound of a sword going through someone\u2019s neck. </p><p>You could practically see it. You could feel it. Your bare feet against the material of a stone cold stage outside the sept. And Sansa\u2019s grateful expression. And then the sound of his head hitting the ground. </p><p>Your mother\u2019s arms wrapping around you to keep you from attacking Joffrey. The sound of Sansa falling to ground as she fainted. The heavy weight of your stomach as you fell to your knees.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t that. It was a fighting pit. It wasn\u2019t Ned Stark\u2019s head that had been cut off. It was the head of the loosing fighter.</p><p>The sound of the crows cheering came back into focus as Tyrion shook your shoulder. \u201cY/N? Y/N? Are you alright?\u201d</p><p>Your head snapped over to Tyrion. Your eyes were wide as you remembered what had happened. You didn\u2019t even realize it was something you had been trying to forget until now. You had forgotten, you had forgotten that you tried to fight Joffrey as Illyn Payne went to get Ned Stark\u2019s sword. </p><p>His worried face remained when he saw the almost traumatized look on your face. The look of someone who\u2019s seen death. You\u2019ve seen it plenty he knew that. He knew you hated killing for sport, and killing that was useless.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d You choked out grabbing onto the armrest of your seat. Tyrion however seemed unconvinced, but he dropped the matter.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t approve?\u201d Hizdhar asked Tyrion as you tried to regulate your breathing into a normal pace.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. I can do without it in my leisure time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. Yet it\u2019s an unpleasant question, but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to confuse what is with what ought to be, especially when what is has worked in your favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about myself. I\u2019m talking about the necessary conditions for greatness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is greatness?\u201d Daenerys questioned </p><p>\u201cThat is a vital part of the great city of Meereen, which existed long before you or I and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father would have liked you.\u201d Tyrion mumbled</p><p>When the next fighters were brought out your face dropped. For fucks sake Jorah. Is all you could think. Tyrion had gotten him out of the city without being killed. Now he decided to come back. You understood why. But you didn\u2019t understand why he had decided to go into the fighting pits once again.</p><p>You wanted to hold your breath and pretend he wasn\u2019t down there. But when Daenerys clapped her hands you knew he\u2019d win. He was a knight of Westeros.</p><p>Jorah fought and killed. Until there was only three left he could fight. You closed your eyes as you heard the fighting. Useless fighting. Fighting that wouldn\u2019t do anything for anybody. Harming and killing for sport. You hadn\u2019t realized people other than Joffrey had enjoyed it.</p><p>\u201cYou can end this!\u201d Tyrion said. Leaning forward in his chair</p><p>\u201cShe cannot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can.\u201d</p><p>You opened your eyes again to see Jorah, back on the ground a sword pointing to him. He couldn\u2019t die. Not now. Not Today.</p><p>One of the men put their sword through the other\u2019s back and he fell to the ground in pain. It gave him enough time to grab his own weapon and get ready for the next fight. You closed your eyes again. Not wanting to see what was happening.</p><p>Eventually your ears were greeted with booing. Opening your eyes once more you saw Jorah. Standing tall and the man he\u2019d been ready to fight on the ground, severely wounded.</p><p>Jorah grabbed his spear and aimed it like he was about to throw it. But it was aimed towards the seating area that you all sat at.</p><p>You moved quickly to avoid it and fell the ground by the pillar. The spear had flew from Jorah\u2019s hand and into the chest of a man with a golden mask. Someone who hadn\u2019t been there before. Had he been trying to sneak up on Daenerys?</p><p>You looked around and suddenly men with similar masks started standing from the crowd. You pushed yourself from the ground. They had begun to chant something in Valyrian. You pulled your sword from it\u2019s sheath and got into a defensive position. You walked to be in front of the queen. You didn\u2019t know if it was part of your instinct telling you to protect her.</p><p>\u201cProtect you queen!\u201d Darrio shouted. You watched as the men in masks began to kill citizens in the crowd, slitting their throats and stabbing them to death. People tried scrambling away and running. Some got away, some did not.</p><p>\u201cYour grace! Come with me! I know a way\u2014\u201c He had been interrupted by one of the men stabbing him through the heart with a dagger.</p><p>One of the men went towards Darrio and the other to you. You hadn\u2019t hesitated to put a sword through his throat. You pulled the sword out of his throat, it had been covered in his blood. But you didn\u2019t even bat an eye.</p><p>Jorah had gotten up to where you all were and went to Daenerys holding his hand out for her to take. And she did. He took her to get her out of the massacre that was happening. You followed them closely behind as Jorah helped lower her into the fighting pit. Somewhere were you could make your escape.</p><p>You jumped down after her, sword in hand ready to attack anyone who was going to harm her, Tyrion or you.</p><p>You had all gone to a tunnel that would lead out. But the wooden gate had been closed and a man in a golden mask stepped forward ready to fight as well. Jorah stabbed him through the stomach as Darrio said \u201cThe other side, follow me!\u201d</p><p>When Messandei and Tyrion ran towards you all Daenerys took Messandei\u2019s hand and kept running to the other side. Unsullied circling you all as you continued to run. You all came to a sudden stop as more of the men ran through the tunnel you had been running to. You all stood. In a circle as they surrounded you all. The unsullied was all that was holding them back.</p><p>You felt your heart stop when a roar ripped through the air.

Asking the Unsullied to keep an eye out for a toddler with dark curly hair, pale skin and dark brown eyes. She seemed understanding of the situation you were in. The desperation you had to get Lucia back in your arms safely.</p>[[MORE]]<p>The cut had mostly healed, it was almost a large scar on your face. And when you had looked in the mirror you couldn\u2019t recognize yourself. You remembered once looking in a mirror and seeing a fresh still child like face, full of innocence. A face that had been yours. Tan skin and \u00a0golden hair. Now, you looked older, more worn and more hardened. You weren\u2019t the fifteen year old girl who believed that Robert Baratheon was your father. You were nineteen. In that time you\u2019d had a baby. You\u2019d killed someone. You\u2019d killed your brother and you still hadn\u2019t told anyone. </p><p>This pit reminded you of Joffrey. He would have loved this. A giant arena to look down at people slaughtering each other. \u00a0You remembered the wooden sword fighting Robert had discouraged from you. Something he\u2019d told you not to do. </p><p>Now look where you were. In front of a queen, Joffrey\u2019s sword strapped to your waist, a gentle reminder of what you had allowed yourself to do. You hadn\u2019t imagined that the poison would be as gruesome as it had been. You had felt like you betrayed the person your brother had been. When he was kind to you.</p><p>Daenerys\u2019s betrothed walked around and sat next to Daenerys. Fixing his yellow garments of clothing before settling into a position to sit in.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d </p><p>\u201cJust making sure everything is in order.\u201d He responded to her. </p><p>You furrowed your brows slightly. What did he have to do? Wasn\u2019t everything already in order? It should have been. From what you understood, these kind of things were usually sorted out the few nights before hand. So nothing went awry.</p><p>Daenerys seemed to think this was strange as well, she looked at him questionably as did you. She then looked back to the pit where the gates opened and horses came stampeding across and through another gate, a man following behind on the ground.</p><p>People stood applauding and cheering as he came to the center of the pit and faced the Queen of Meereen. He then held his arm out in a straight line and turned, the entire audience quieted up as he then began to speak in Valyrian. It was a language you didn\u2019t know, let alone understand.</p><p>Once he was finished speaking the crowd began to cheer and applaud once more. Just resuming what they\u2019d been doing before hand.</p><p>Two men came out with weapons in hand and stood beside the previous man. Their armor wasn\u2019t even armor and you didn\u2019t recognize their faces. You doubted you\u2019d be able to from where you sat anyway.</p><p>The two men stepped froward and said the exact same thing in Valyrian and then stopped speaking. As if\u2026 waiting for something to happen.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re waiting for you.\u201d Her betrothed said factually. When Daenerys looked at him confused he added \u201cClap your hands.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys raised her hands reluctantly and clapped. The entire crowd began cheering once more. The two men began fighting. You hated this. Killing wasn\u2019t a sport. Joffrey had made it a sport. And when Gregor Clegane stabbed a men through the throat at a jousting match it was like he was suddenly in love with the sport.</p><p>\u201cYou should bet on the smaller man. No question, that\u2019s where you should put your money.\u201d Darrio said coming up close to the queen.</p><p>\u201cThe smaller man it is.\u201d Tyrion responded</p><p>\u201cTyrion.\u201d You grumbled playing with the hilt of your sword, tracing the intricate details that had been put into the mold. There was one thing you had to commend your grandfather for, it was his eye for detail and how certain things should look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not putting my money anywhere.\u201d Daenerys responded</p><p>\u201cKings and queens never bet on the games. Perhaps you should go and find someone who does.\u201d</p><p>The two got into a large conversation, many things that you didn\u2019t pay any attention to. Your mind kept going to your brother. You didn\u2019t know why it did. You hadn\u2019t thought about him in months. But now you were.</p><p>You could remember a lot of things about him. How he had looked at you when you had been hiding in a pantry in the kitchens together eating some of the cakes that was made in honor of Tommen\u2019s birth. How he had smiled at you when you handed him one of the cakes.</p><p>You also could remember how he looked at you when you were able to walk again after giving birth. It wasn\u2019t distaste like it had been once before, when he had locked you in your chambers. Maybe it had been pity. Something that had gone away quickly. That much was sure.</p><p>You were snapped out of your thoughts when you heard the sound of a sword going through someone\u2019s neck. </p><p>You could practically see it. You could feel it. Your bare feet against the material of a stone cold stage outside the sept. And Sansa\u2019s grateful expression. And then the sound of his head hitting the ground. </p><p>Your mother\u2019s arms wrapping around you to keep you from attacking Joffrey. The sound of Sansa falling to ground as she fainted. The heavy weight of your stomach as you fell to your knees.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t that. It was a fighting pit. It wasn\u2019t Ned Stark\u2019s head that had been cut off. It was the head of the loosing fighter.</p><p>The sound of the crows cheering came back into focus as Tyrion shook your shoulder. \u201cY/N? Y/N? Are you alright?\u201d</p><p>Your head snapped over to Tyrion. Your eyes were wide as you remembered what had happened. You didn\u2019t even realize it was something you had been trying to forget until now. You had forgotten, you had forgotten that you tried to fight Joffrey as Illyn Payne went to get Ned Stark\u2019s sword. </p><p>His worried face remained when he saw the almost traumatized look on your face. The look of someone who\u2019s seen death. You\u2019ve seen it plenty he knew that. He knew you hated killing for sport, and killing that was useless.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d You choked out grabbing onto the armrest of your seat. Tyrion however seemed unconvinced, but he dropped the matter.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t approve?\u201d Hizdhar asked Tyrion as you tried to regulate your breathing into a normal pace.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. I can do without it in my leisure time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. Yet it\u2019s an unpleasant question, but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to confuse what is with what ought to be, especially when what is has worked in your favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about myself. I\u2019m talking about the necessary conditions for greatness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is greatness?\u201d Daenerys questioned </p><p>\u201cThat is a vital part of the great city of Meereen, which existed long before you or I and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father would have liked you.\u201d Tyrion mumbled</p><p>When the next fighters were brought out your face dropped. For fucks sake Jorah. Is all you could think. Tyrion had gotten him out of the city without being killed. Now he decided to come back. You understood why. But you didn\u2019t understand why he had decided to go into the fighting pits once again.</p><p>You wanted to hold your breath and pretend he wasn\u2019t down there. But when Daenerys clapped her hands you knew he\u2019d win. He was a knight of Westeros.</p><p>Jorah fought and killed. Until there was only three left he could fight. You closed your eyes as you heard the fighting. Useless fighting. Fighting that wouldn\u2019t do anything for anybody. Harming and killing for sport. You hadn\u2019t realized people other than Joffrey had enjoyed it.</p><p>\u201cYou can end this!\u201d Tyrion said. Leaning forward in his chair</p><p>\u201cShe cannot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can.\u201d</p><p>You opened your eyes again to see Jorah, back on the ground a sword pointing to him. He couldn\u2019t die. Not now. Not Today.</p><p>One of the men put their sword through the other\u2019s back and he fell to the ground in pain. It gave him enough time to grab his own weapon and get ready for the next fight. You closed your eyes again. Not wanting to see what was happening.</p><p>Eventually your ears were greeted with booing. Opening your eyes once more you saw Jorah. Standing tall and the man he\u2019d been ready to fight on the ground, severely wounded.</p><p>Jorah grabbed his spear and aimed it like he was about to throw it. But it was aimed towards the seating area that you all sat at.</p><p>You moved quickly to avoid it and fell the ground by the pillar. The spear had flew from Jorah\u2019s hand and into the chest of a man with a golden mask. Someone who hadn\u2019t been there before. Had he been trying to sneak up on Daenerys?</p><p>You looked around and suddenly men with similar masks started standing from the crowd. You pushed yourself from the ground. They had begun to chant something in Valyrian. You pulled your sword from it\u2019s sheath and got into a defensive position. You walked to be in front of the queen. You didn\u2019t know if it was part of your instinct telling you to protect her.</p><p>\u201cProtect you queen!\u201d Darrio shouted. You watched as the men in masks began to kill citizens in the crowd, slitting their throats and stabbing them to death. People tried scrambling away and running. Some got away, some did not.</p><p>\u201cYour grace! Come with me! I know a way\u2014\u201c He had been interrupted by one of the men stabbing him through the heart with a dagger.</p><p>One of the men went towards Darrio and the other to you. You hadn\u2019t hesitated to put a sword through his throat. You pulled the sword out of his throat, it had been covered in his blood. But you didn\u2019t even bat an eye.</p><p>Jorah had gotten up to where you all were and went to Daenerys holding his hand out for her to take. And she did. He took her to get her out of the massacre that was happening. You followed them closely behind as Jorah helped lower her into the fighting pit. Somewhere were you could make your escape.</p><p>You jumped down after her, sword in hand ready to attack anyone who was going to harm her, Tyrion or you.</p><p>You had all gone to a tunnel that would lead out. But the wooden gate had been closed and a man in a golden mask stepped forward ready to fight as well. Jorah stabbed him through the stomach as Darrio said \u201cThe other side, follow me!\u201d</p><p>When Messandei and Tyrion ran towards you all Daenerys took Messandei\u2019s hand and kept running to the other side. Unsullied circling you all as you continued to run. You all came to a sudden stop as more of the men ran through the tunnel you had been running to. You all stood. In a circle as they surrounded you all. The unsullied was all that was holding them back.</p><p>You felt your heart stop when a roar ripped through the air. It wasn\u2019t something you\u2019d ever heard before. Everyone stopped fighting and froze. Looking up at the sky. It was a dragon?</p><p>All was quiet until a gust of fire went through the air and large dark colored dragon flew through it. The men began to run to leave, as the dragon circled around the arena. The dragon landed in front of you all and roared </p><p>One man however didn\u2019t stop running towards Daenerys. You had jumped in front of her sword in hand but the dragon grabbed the man by the head, shaking his head violently until his body broke off into pieces because of it. He spat fire at some of the men relentlessly and the men retaliated throwing spears at the poor thing. </p><p>\u201cDrogon!\u201d Daenerys yelled</p><p>She walked forward out of the circle to the dragon pulling one of the spears out of his body. The dragon then turned to her, angry and began to roar loudly in her face. Her hair being sept behind her shoulders from the amount of force. But when he stopped she reached her hand out before more men threw spears making the dragon yell in pain.</p><p>You watched Daenerys as she climbed onto Drogon\u2019s back. When she whispered something to the dragon he began to march forward. You grabbed Messandei by the hand pulling her out of the way and watched as Daenerys\u2019s dragon took air with her on his back. Flying out of the arena.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a>@siennarothenburg <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57PumL3XTHKMbhaLBCDM6Q\" target=\"_blank\">@nighthood13</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzBlNV0PDM4SXm6Ym1PSJAw\" target=\"_blank\">@cevanstann</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/majsdnQ_JnelNmwA-W4FunA\" target=\"_blank\">@boredbrit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA_-qHoQbaPG0d8C94bexmA\" target=\"_blank\">@celestial-melancholy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrQghx2HTRQWATopqUw0s2w\" target=\"_blank\">@qhbr2013</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAeRnp4q0NBV8t7q1b6qpVw\" target=\"_blank\">@falling-stars-never-cry</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms0BdTYfmHt42bvH5n-1KJw\" target=\"_blank\">@vxidnik</a>@<a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/dashboard/blog/strangerthingsholland\" target=\"_blank\">strangerthingholland</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY2iDPZFAYSCyrTHvpHNOmQ\" target=\"_blank\">@awkwxrdmarauders</a>@tovloveliampayne <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmBZJJPECktMOQurgslNATQ\" target=\"_blank\">@veggidinosaurnuggets</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBWKqX0a6Xkb1gctJJJDd1g\" target=\"_blank\">@-thatgirloverthere-</a>@<a href=\"http://shieldgallovershieldgallover.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">shieldgallover</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQcJ41Q73x6-KoyP-pxsiLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@starkbelova</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9cgOoG0Hpcm0odEGY0N9og\" target=\"_blank\">@lightbeautysblog</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN3t6WpcWC8Luy-RdOQ5m1w\" target=\"_blank\">@sillyoldbeleh</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSjd3anGyRbLn0ViSUPR1bA\" target=\"_blank\">@emilielskov</a>@<a href=\"https://kayylluhh.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">kayylluhh</a>@<a href=\"https://honey-honey-boy.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">honey-honey-boy</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxYekjWCnH24z0QwoMRqFtg\" target=\"_blank\">@superbuckytrash</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkPX9bTS4_RT9JziquUBgpg\" target=\"_blank\">@camu-winchester</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY4tTcT1E_AqqiXU7UO0rUQ\" target=\"_blank\">@roger-bang-the-drum</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWMLSsKXRwPp1UkfyaHeR2g\" target=\"_blank\">@rebel4fandom</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg_AhM9FpeAUfhk1vcPXwQQ\" target=\"_blank\">@thegirlwithoutaname87</a> @megafandomfangirl <a>@nan-nie</a>\u200b<br></p></p>",

It was a dragon?</p><p>All was quiet until a gust of fire went through the air and large dark colored dragon flew through it. The men began to run to leave, as the dragon circled around the arena. The dragon landed in front of you all and roared </p><p>One man however didn&rsquo;t stop running towards Daenerys. You had jumped in front of her sword in hand but the dragon grabbed the man by the head, shaking his head violently until his body broke off into pieces because of it. He spat fire at some of the men relentlessly and the men retaliated throwing spears at the poor thing. </p><p>&ldquo;Drogon!&rdquo; Daenerys yelled</p><p>She walked forward out of the circle to the dragon pulling one of the spears out of his body. The dragon then turned to her, angry and began to roar loudly in her face. Her hair being sept behind her shoulders from the amount of force. But when he stopped she reached her hand out before more men threw spears making the dragon yell in pain.</p><p>You watched Daenerys as she climbed onto Drogon&rsquo;s back. When she whispered something to the dragon he began to march forward. You grabbed Messandei by the hand pulling her out of the way and watched as Daenerys&rsquo;s dragon took air with her on his back. Flying out of the arena.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a>@siennarothenburg <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57PumL3XTHKMbhaLBCDM6Q\" target=\"_blank\">@nighthood13</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzBlNV0PDM4SXm6Ym1PSJAw\" target=\"_blank\">@cevanstann</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/majsdnQ_JnelNmwA-W4FunA\" target=\"_blank\">@boredbrit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA_-qHoQbaPG0d8C94bexmA\" target=\"_blank\">@celestial-melancholy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrQghx2HTRQWATopqUw0s2w\" target=\"_blank\">@qhbr2013</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAeRnp4q0NBV8t7q1b6qpVw\" target=\"_blank\">@falling-stars-never-cry</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms0BdTYfmHt42bvH5n-1KJw\" target=\"_blank\">@vxidnik</a>@<a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/dashboard/blog/strangerthingsholland\" target=\"_blank\">strangerthingholland</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY2iDPZFAYSCyrTHvpHNOmQ\" target=\"_blank\">@awkwxrdmarauders</a>@tovloveliampayne <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmBZJJPECktMOQurgslNATQ\" target=\"_blank\">@veggidinosaurnuggets</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBWKqX0a6Xkb1gctJJJDd1g\" target=\"_blank\">@-thatgirloverthere-</a>@<a href=\"http://shieldgallovershieldgallover.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">shieldgallover</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQcJ41Q73x6-KoyP-pxsiLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@starkbelova</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9cgOoG0Hpcm0odEGY0N9og\" target=\"_blank\">@lightbeautysblog</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN3t6WpcWC8Luy-RdOQ5m1w\" target=\"_blank\">@sillyoldbeleh</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSjd3anGyRbLn0ViSUPR1bA\" target=\"_blank\">@emilielskov</a>@<a href=\"https://kayylluhh.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">kayylluhh</a>@<a href=\"https://honey-honey-boy.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">honey-honey-boy</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxYekjWCnH24z0QwoMRqFtg\" target=\"_blank\">@superbuckytrash</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkPX9bTS4_RT9JziquUBgpg\" target=\"_blank\">@camu-winchester</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY4tTcT1E_AqqiXU7UO0rUQ\" target=\"_blank\">@roger-bang-the-drum</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWMLSsKXRwPp1UkfyaHeR2g\" target=\"_blank\">@rebel4fandom</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg_AhM9FpeAUfhk1vcPXwQQ\" target=\"_blank\">@thegirlwithoutaname87</a> @megafandomfangirl <a>@nan-nie</a>&#8203;<br /></p></p>",

Asking the Unsullied to keep an eye out for a toddler with dark curly hair, pale skin and dark brown eyes. She seemed understanding of the situation you were in.
