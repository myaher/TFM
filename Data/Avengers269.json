Gently, she grabs his chin to guide him to make eye contact with her. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong bub?\u201d she whispers softly.</p><p>He shakes his head, \u201cNothing, I just\u2026.I feel guilty.\u201d</p><p>She tilts her head a little in confusion. \u201cGuilty?

The door swung open, and your worry was replaced with anger when you saw the state of your bedroom. You had half a mind to go back and demand to know why Tony had gone through your things, but Bucky hadn\u2019t wanted you in the room. You had a sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach when you wondered if it had anything to do with what Sam had told you. </p><p>Doing as asked, you shut the door behind you and locked it. You pulled your phone out and noticed several messages and missed calls from Peter. Ignoring them for the time being, you started scrolling through your contacts, pausing briefly when his name came up. You were tempted to call, and had it been anyone else confronting Bucky, you would have. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d just make excuses for Tony,\u201d you muttered, scrolling past. You found the name you wanted and pressed it, hoping he wasn\u2019t too busy to pick up.</p><p><i>\u201cHey, Y/N!\u201d</i> Steve greeted cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cBucky\u2019s in trouble,\u201d you blurted, forgoing niceties. \u201cTony\u2019s armed and <i>super</i> pissed at him.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p><p>Neither man said a word as you reluctantly shuffled to your room, waiting until they heard the bolt lock to speak.</p><p>\u201cAnything you wanna say to me, Barnes?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot here. She might be listening at the door.\u201d </p><p>He hesitated, knowing Bucky would be more of a challenge in close quarters. \u201cI think not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on,\u201d he ignored Tony\u2019s scoff, \u201cbut I have an idea and I just don\u2019t want her scared. Nothing funny. You have my word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour word means <i>nothing</i>. FRIDAY, if he tries anything, sound the alarm.\u201d</p><p>\u201c&hellip; Of course. Where to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe holding cells.\u201d</p><p>Bucky stepped back into the corner, trying to appear passive. Tony entered, sticking to the opposite corner and growing tense when the doors closed behind him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this about?\u201d he gestured to the book.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to ask questions!\u201d Tony snapped. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?!\u201d</p><p>Bucky was tired. Almost tired enough to tell Tony everything on the spot. <i>Almost</i>. \u201cI need you to tell me first why we have this. Please, it\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, his helmet retracting, but his blaster still aimed at his chest. \u201cAbout two-thirds in, I found your note.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat note?\u201d Alarmed, Bucky immediately began flipping through the pages until he came across the slip of paper. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not buying your little act.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d he hissed, skimming the letter. \u201cSomething\u2019s off\u2026\u201d</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes, growing tired of the charade. \u201cNo shi-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand. This doesn\u2019t make sense&hellip;\u201d Bucky turned to him, his eyes begging. \u201cWe need to go to my room. I have something to show you.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cStark! What are you doing? Buck, are you alright?\u201d</i> Steve\u2019s frantic voice came from the speaker. </p><p>\u201cNot for long,\u201d Tony said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask your buddy what he\u2019s been up to? What plans he had for my daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>What are you talking about?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t write this,\u201d Bucky defended. \u201cBut I know who did. Steve, go to my room. In the closet, I have a cardboard box with various items. Bring it to the holding cells.\u201d</p><p>Bucky waited for Tony to step out and get some distance before making a move. He went in the direction Tony gestured, hoping Steve would hurry.</p><p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p><p>Satisfied with the armed guards stood outside Dean\u2019s room and patrolling the hospital grounds, Sam returned to the tower and was promptly led toward the elevator. The guard informed FRIDAY that he was to be taken to Tony, and went back to his duties, leaving Sam alone. </p><p>When the elevator stopped and the doors opened, he made to step out, but was stopped by FRIDAY.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t your stop, Mr. Winchester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWinchester?\u201d the man who stepped inside asked. \u201cRelative of Dean\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>Sam would recognize Captain America anywhere, and had the situation been any different, he\u2019d have been ecstatic to meet him. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s my brother,\u201d he replied coldly. </p><p>And, had the situation been any different, Steve would\u2019ve made more of an effort to be polite. \u201cI wish him a speedy recovery.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stop the words from spilling. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Sam shrugged, \u201cthings won\u2019t be so good for your friend when Dean wakes up, will they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour floor, Mr. Winchester,\u201d FRIDAY said, interrupting their chat.</p><p>Sam stormed out, not giving the man following him a second glance as he approached Tony and Bucky. The latter was sitting calmly in a cell as Tony paced. </p><p>\u201cHere are the things you asked for, Buck.\u201d Steve dropped the box at Tony\u2019s feet, glaring at him. \u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Nat\u2019s voice rang from the stairs.</p><p>Tony huffed in annoyance. \u201cWhat are you doing here, Romanoff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteve called for backup.\u201d She pulled up a chair and settled in, crossing her arms. \u201c<i>Now </i>explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarnes has been planning to elope with Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were!\u201d Tony snapped, handing the letter to Natasha. \u201cRead that for Cap and Sam.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, but did as asked.</p><p>\u201c<b><i>\u2018My pretty little Y/N,</i></b></p><p><b><i>It\u2019s time. You looked uncomfortable in the purple ball gown. Did you enjoy my gifts? They\u2019re perfect aren\u2019t they? I\u2019m tired of the secrecy and I can see you are too. We know we belong together. Who would\u2019ve guessed your coming to New York would change everything? Are you free on Thursday? I can buy us an island where no one will find us. Pack the black shorts with the ladybugs on them. Skip school on Thursday and meet me at that diner you love. Why wait any lon-\u2019</i></b></p><p>You think Bucky wrote this? Tony, this is all over the place. Whoever wrote it, their mind is scattered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, do we know for certain Frosty here\u2019s not still got something scrambled in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Tony!\u201d Steve barked. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d All eyes turned to Sam. \u201cAnd Dean found out, didn\u2019t he? That\u2019s why you shot him.\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for anyone to respond before playing the voicemail Dean left. </p><p>Slowly, everyone\u2019s gazes shifted to Bucky. \u201cI- I didn\u2019t. I was in the tower all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you prove it?\u201d Steve asked, desperation in his voice.</p><p>\u201cFRIDAY, can you corroborate Barnes regarding his whereabouts last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Agent Romanoff.\u201d Several surveillance holograms appeared, each showing Bucky had indeed not left the tower.</p><p>Sam swallowed thickly. \u201cCould he have altered the footage?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot without me or Tony to help him, and I did no such thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk, so maybe he didn\u2019t try to kill Dean,\u201d Tony admitted, \u201cbut he still wrote that note!\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept this isn\u2019t Bucky\u2019s writing,\u201d Nat persisted. </p><p>Tony scoffed. \u201cPlease. Aren\u2019t you guys trained to disguise yourselves in every form? It was in the book he gave her!\u201d</p><p>Nat didn\u2019t have an answer for that, so she turned to Steve.</p><p>\u201cBuck, how did that note get in there?\u201d</p><p>Sam shook his head in disappointment at Steve\u2019s willingness to turn a blind eye when it came to his oldest friend.</p><p>\u201cThe book wasn\u2019t from me,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIt was from Dean. Everything in that box, all the gifts, the flowers, that was all Dean.\u201d</p><p>Natasha grabbed the box as Steve went to fetch a table.</p><p>\u201cWhen the package came, you said it was meant as an apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s convenient,\u201d Sam muttered. \u201cHow do you explain the message he left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo shift the blame!\u201d Bucky turned his glare on Sam. \u201cI wanted to confirm it was your brother sending it. And guess what? He was angry I\u2019d taken the credit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you hear yourself?! If he was angry it\u2019s because he knew you were up to something!\u201d He snatched the note from the top of the box Nat was holding and scanned it. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Dean\u2019s writing, either! And don\u2019t tell me he could disguise it this well!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe coulda had someone else write it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you could have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot helping right now, guys,\u201d Nat called. \u201cLet\u2019s look this stuff over and see if we can\u2019t find any clues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, Peter Parker wishes to speak to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now, FRIDAY.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe insists. He\u2019s in distress.\u201d</p><p>He really didn\u2019t need anything else to distract him, but considering the near death experiences he had not long before, he agreed. \u201cAlright, send him in,\u201d he sighed.</p><p>Bucky could only watch from his cell as the others sifted through the items he\u2019d collected, hoping they could find the connection he failed to. His mind wandered to you, and though he wanted to ask FRIDAY if you were alright, he refrained from doing so knowing it would anger Tony even more.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark?\u201d Only Bucky heard Peter call timidly. \u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>The boy\u2019s face was splotched, his eyes red and glassy. You didn\u2019t need to be a spy to see the boy had been crying. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoah. Hey, Kid, are you hurt?\u201d Tony stepped away from the table to approach Peter and look him over. \u201cFRIDAY said you needed help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to see if Y/N was ok, but FRIDAY said she was on lockdown. Why is Sergeant Barnes in a cell?\u201d</p><p>Nat frowned at his statement. \u201cWhy were you worried about Y/N?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t answer the phone. I thought-\u201d he choked out a sob as his eyes began to fill with tears again. \u201cI was scared she\u2019d been at the diner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat diner?\u201d Steve asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine, Pete,\u201d Tony soothed. \u201cShe\u2019s in her room. What happened?\u201d</p><p>Peter stared blankly at them. \u201cMr. and Mrs. Carr\u2019s place. It\u2019s all over the n-hews,\u201d he sniffled. \u201cShe goes there all the time.\u201d</p><p>Tony vaguely remembered some story he\u2019d heard earlier, and his blood ran cold. \u201cFRIDAY, who owned the place that was massacred earlier today?\u201d</p><p>There was a silent moment while she searched for the information. \u201cSal and Barbara Carr.\u201d </p><p>Steve grabbed the note. \u201c<i>\u2018Skip school on Thursday and meet me at that diner you love.\u2019</i> You can\u2019t mean\u2026\u201d</p><p>Peter looked around at them all, confused. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDean\u2019s been in a coma.\u201d Sam turned to Bucky. \u201cWhere were you when I got there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting her breakfast a couple blocks away from the hospital. The Carr\u2019s place is on the other side of town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it couldn\u2019t have been you.\u201d Bucky shook his head in response. \u201cLet him out, Stark,\u201d Nat demanded. \u201cWhat do you know about the people who attacked the place, Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Um, there hasn\u2019t been a photo or composite done or anything like that, but a witness said it was one guy.\u201d</p><p>Tony grabbed his shoulders firmly. \u201cAre you sure? It wasn\u2019t like a gang or some organization?\u201d</p><p>Nat eased his grip off the boy. \u201cTony, if it were an organization, or anyone trying to get at you, they\u2019ve had plenty of chances to take her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d FRIDAY interrupted. \u201cA composite sketch of the killer has been released.\u201d </p><p>The hologram showed a sketch of man with unkempt hair and a large grin.</p><p>\u201cUm, Mr. Stark?\u201d Peter gaped at the image she\u2019d brought up. \u201cThat\u2019s the guy who pushed me off the platform at the station.\u201d</p><p>All eyes turned to Peter,</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Bucky asked, turning back to the drawing. \u201cBecause that guy nearly hit me with his car on Y/N\u2019s first day of school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean intentionally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems so if he went after you, too.\u201d</p><p>Tony watched Peter\u2019s reaction before taking another look at the composite. \u201cSo what, you\u2019re saying it\u2019s just some obsessed nutjob?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it is.\u201d Nat glared at the image. \u201cI have to go. I\u2019ll call you when I get something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright. Fine. One guy. I can handle that.\u201d Tony unlocked Bucky\u2019s cell, holding the door open for him as he stepped out. \u201cBarnes, Winchester, come with me. Pete, you and Cap fill the others in. Find out everything you can about this psycho.\u201d</p><p>In the elevator, Tony called Pepper to send for an ambulance, then called for your security team to meet in the garage. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your plan?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving and taking her with you.\u201d He stepped out of the garage, pleased to see the guards ready to get to work. \u201cI need you all to take a drive.\u201d He grabbed a set of keys and tossed them to a guard. \u201cWinchester, you and Y/N will go with him to the compound upstate and wait there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;ll take her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I need you to be my backup,\u201d Tony said. \u201cWhere she goes, you follow. I need you to be seen far away from her.\u201d</p><p>Bucky reluctantly followed him back into the elevator, his mind still trying to wrap around the situation. \u201cYou sure she\u2019ll be safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he replied, not looking at him. \u201cOnce its released she\u2019s been injured and taken to the hospital, he\u2019ll be headed there while she\u2019ll be headed upstate.\u201d </p><p>He could feel the nervous energy radiating off him. He also figured he probably owed him an apology, but the thought left a bad taste in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cAre ya gonna tell her?\u201d</p><p>Tony rubbed the side of his face. He was tired, and he was afraid. And now he was about to ruin everything he\u2019d been working for to build an amicable relationship with you. \u201cNo. You\u2019re right, she\u2019ll just get scared.\u201d Bucky nodded, but stayed silent, and Tony should have felt a little bad. \u201cYou know what you have to do, don\u2019t you? What this means?\u201d</p><p>Bucky\u2019s eyes darted to his feet, but again he nodded. \u201cIt means she\u2019s gonna hate me.\u201d</p><p>Tony instinctively reached out to give him a comforting pat, but pulled his hand back, scoffing internally. Instead, he offered, \u00a0\u201cI wish there was another way.\u201d And to his surprise, it sounded almost sincere.</p><p>The doors opened on your floor, and Bucky followed Tony out. The two took a deep breath, waiting for the other\u2019s go ahead before knocking.</p><p>You flung the door open, and they pushed past you before you could feel any relief at seeing they weren\u2019t about to fight anymore. Tony grabbed an empty bag from your closet, and Bucky was pulling everything out of your backpack. </p><p>\u201cWhat was all that about earlier? Is everything alright? What are you doing?\u201d You watched in horror as they began to fill the bags with the contents of your closet and dresser. \u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d</p><p>Neither of them said anything, just carried on packing as much as they could in the bags. You ran to Tony and tried to grab your bag from him, but he turned to keep you from grabbing it as he ignored your demands to know what was happening.</p><p>\u201cBucky,\u201d you pleaded, running over to him and yanking the backpack from his grasp. \u201cBucky, please! Why are you doing this?!\u201d His silence stung, but his sudden inability to even look at you was what really hurt. \u201cPlease, talk to me,\u201d you begged. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d </p><p>He took hold of the bag, but you weren\u2019t going to let it go that easily. He tugged on it and turned, jolting you forward at an angle, and pushed you hard enough to send you stumbling against your bed. He zipped the bag and placed it by the door, grabbing another to fill, doing his best to ignore the betrayed look in your eyes. </p><p>When they\u2019d gathered enough of your things, Tony grabbed your arm to lead you out. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going away for a while,\u201d was all he supplied. \u201cAnd I need your phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell! You can\u2019t take my phone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it.\u201d As soon as he spoke the words, you felt Bucky snatch it from your pocket and placed it in his own.</p><p>You knew you weren\u2019t getting it back, no matter how hard you tried. Now you had no way to contact your mother. \u201cMy mom,\u201d you swallowed back a lump. \u201cDoes\u2026 did she plan this with you? Was this always meant to be the arrangement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d Tony snapped, clearly offended at the insinuation. \u201cYou just can\u2019t be here right now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you bring me here if you were just going to send me away?! If you were going to pull this shit, you could have just left me at home! I was happy there!\u201d You yanked your arm from his grasp, turning to Bucky. \u201cAnd what about you?\u201d your voice cracked. \u201cI thought we were friends&hellip;\u201d</p><p>Bucky didn\u2019t answer, and Tony ushered you into the elevator, the ride down to the garage quiet except for your occasional sniffle. You were taken to the car where Sam was waiting, and your bags were put in the trunk.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Sam opened the door for you, \u201cget in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it you\u2019re not going to tell me anything either?\u201d you snapped. \u201cDo you eve-\u201d</p><p>The sound of approaching sirens interrupted, and you turned to the others for an explanation when an ambulance drove into the garage. You began to grow concerned when Bucky shoved your backpack into your arms and pushed you into the car, blocking your view of the vehicle. </p><p>It wasn\u2019t long until the ambulance returned, speeding past your car as it left the building. Tony made a call as Bucky blocked the door, and Sam climbed into the seat beside you. Tony stayed on the phone for nearly half an hour, but you couldn&rsquo;t hear a word of it.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Barnes, we need to go to the hospital!\u201d he called after hanging up. </p><p>Bucky took a last glance back at you, only vaguely making out your angry face behind the tinted window. You opened your backpack as the car started and made its way to the exit, hoping your earbuds were left inside. Though you didn\u2019t have anything to plug them into, you hoped they\u2019d be enough to let Sam know you were in no mood to speak to him. There was a picture frame at the top. Though the car was moving and you were already halfway outside, you swung the door open, causing the car to stop and Sam to reach out to grab you, but he was too late. </p><p>Tony\u2019s car screeched to a halt just behind yours, but it was Bucky who stepped out.</p><p>\u201cGet back in the car!\u201d he ordered.</p><p>His tone stopped you in your tracks. He\u2019d never shouted at you before, and it only made you angrier. Rather than hand him the frame back like you\u2019d intended, you threw it at his feet, shattering the glass.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole! I never want to see you again!\u201d Without waiting for a response, you climbed back into the car, allowing it to take you wherever it was meant to.</p><p>Tony watched Bucky stare after your car as it drove away, only pulling the photo from the broken frame once it was out of sight. He got in the car and shoved it into the glove compartment before Tony could see it, and they headed toward the hospital.</p><p>\u201cThink anyone saw her?\u201d he asked, forcing his voice to be steady.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tony assured him. \u201cEven if they did, the guy\u2019s probably already halfway to the hospital anyway.\u201d</p><p>Bucky hummed in understanding, hoping he was right. The rest of the trip was made in silence, the tension growing thicker with every minute that passed.</p><p>He dropped Bucky off at the front of the ER, where there was already press waiting. That was the plan; to be seen there so everyone and the crazy man would think that\u2019s where you were as you were taken elsewhere.</p><p>Tony parked the car, and didn\u2019t hesitate to open the glovebox to see what you\u2019d thrown at Bucky. He pulled out the photo and stared.</p><p>You were wearing one of his helmets. Not Bucky\u2019s tactical gear, or Sam\u2019s wings, or holding Steve\u2019s shield, but <i>his</i> helmet. You held a ridiculously heroic pose as Bucky lay on the floor, trying and failing to hide his amusement.</p><p>The jealousy he\u2019d come to expect didn\u2019t wash over him as it usually did. Instead, he was filled with a sadness over your having lost yet another person you trusted. He even felt a little guilty over making Bucky betray you like he did. He could have had anyone else go with him to gather your things, but the sick satisfaction he thought he\u2019d get over watching your bond sever was too much to resist.</p><p>Tony stuffed the picture back in the glove box, and started walking toward the entrance. With every step, his resolve grew; when this was over and you were safe, he\u2019d apologize to Bucky. Maybe he\u2019d even begin to try to make amends with him.</p><p>\u201cFRIDAY, tell the others to suit up and start searching the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, you bastard,\u201d he murmured as the reporters waved him over. \u201cLet\u2019s see you try to come for her now.\u201d</p><figure data-orig-width=\"332\" data-orig-height=\"318\"

This doesn\u2019t make sense\u2026\u201d Bucky turned to him, his eyes begging. \u201cWe need to go to my room. I have something to show you.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cStark! What are you doing? Buck, are you alright?\u201d</i> Steve\u2019s frantic voice came from the speaker. </p><p>\u201cNot for long,\u201d Tony said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask your buddy what he\u2019s been up to? What plans he had for my daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>What are you talking about?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t write this,\u201d Bucky defended. \u201cBut I know who did. Steve, go to my room. In the closet, I have a cardboard box with various items. Bring it to the holding cells.\u201d</p><p>Bucky waited for Tony to step out and get some distance before making a move. He went in the direction Tony gestured, hoping Steve would hurry.</p><p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p><p>Satisfied with the armed guards stood outside Dean\u2019s room and patrolling the hospital grounds, Sam returned to the tower and was promptly led toward the elevator. The guard informed FRIDAY that he was to be taken to Tony, and went back to his duties, leaving Sam alone. </p><p>When the elevator stopped and the doors opened, he made to step out, but was stopped by FRIDAY.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t your stop, Mr. Winchester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWinchester?\u201d the man who stepped inside asked. \u201cRelative of Dean\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>Sam would recognize Captain America anywhere, and had the situation been any different, he\u2019d have been ecstatic to meet him. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s my brother,\u201d he replied coldly. </p><p>And, had the situation been any different, Steve would\u2019ve made more of an effort to be polite. \u201cI wish him a speedy recovery.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stop the words from spilling. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Sam shrugged, \u201cthings won\u2019t be so good for your friend when Dean wakes up, will they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour floor, Mr. Winchester,\u201d FRIDAY said, interrupting their chat.</p><p>Sam stormed out, not giving the man following him a second glance as he approached Tony and Bucky. The latter was sitting calmly in a cell as Tony paced. </p><p>\u201cHere are the things you asked for, Buck.\u201d Steve dropped the box at Tony\u2019s feet, glaring at him. \u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Nat\u2019s voice rang from the stairs.</p><p>Tony huffed in annoyance. \u201cWhat are you doing here, Romanoff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteve called for backup.\u201d She pulled up a chair and settled in, crossing her arms. \u201c<i>Now </i>explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarnes has been planning to elope with Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were!\u201d Tony snapped, handing the letter to Natasha. \u201cRead that for Cap and Sam.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, but did as asked.</p><p>\u201c<b><i>\u2018My pretty little Y/N,</i></b></p><p><b><i>It\u2019s time.

Who would\u2019ve guessed your coming to New York would change everything? Are you free on Thursday? I can buy us an island where no one will find us. Pack the black shorts with the ladybugs on them.

Whoever wrote it, their mind is scattered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, do we know for certain Frosty here\u2019s not still got something scrambled in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Tony!\u201d Steve barked. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d All eyes turned to Sam. \u201cAnd Dean found out, didn\u2019t he? That\u2019s why you shot him.\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for anyone to respond before playing the voicemail Dean left. </p><p>Slowly, everyone\u2019s gazes shifted to Bucky. \u201cI- I didn\u2019t. I was in the tower all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you prove it?\u201d Steve asked, desperation in his voice.</p><p>\u201cFRIDAY, can you corroborate Barnes regarding his whereabouts last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Agent Romanoff.\u201d Several surveillance holograms appeared, each showing Bucky had indeed not left the tower.</p><p>Sam swallowed thickly. \u201cCould he have altered the footage?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot without me or Tony to help him, and I did no such thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk, so maybe he didn\u2019t try to kill Dean,\u201d Tony admitted, \u201cbut he still wrote that note!\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept this isn\u2019t Bucky\u2019s writing,\u201d Nat persisted. </p><p>Tony scoffed. \u201cPlease. Aren\u2019t you guys trained to disguise yourselves in every form? It was in the book he gave her!\u201d</p><p>Nat didn\u2019t have an answer for that, so she turned to Steve.</p><p>\u201cBuck, how did that note get in there?\u201d</p><p>Sam shook his head in disappointment at Steve\u2019s willingness to turn a blind eye when it came to his oldest friend.</p><p>\u201cThe book wasn\u2019t from me,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIt was from Dean. Everything in that box, all the gifts, the flowers, that was all Dean.\u201d</p><p>Natasha grabbed the box as Steve went to fetch a table.</p><p>\u201cWhen the package came, you said it was meant as an apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s convenient,\u201d Sam muttered. \u201cHow do you explain the message he left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo shift the blame!\u201d Bucky turned his glare on Sam. \u201cI wanted to confirm it was your brother sending it. And guess what? He was angry I\u2019d taken the credit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you hear yourself?! If he was angry it\u2019s because he knew you were up to something!\u201d He snatched the note from the top of the box Nat was holding and scanned it. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Dean\u2019s writing, either! And don\u2019t tell me he could disguise it this well!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe coulda had someone else write it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you could have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot helping right now, guys,\u201d Nat called. \u201cLet\u2019s look this stuff over and see if we can\u2019t find any clues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, Peter Parker wishes to speak to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now, FRIDAY.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe insists. He\u2019s in distress.\u201d</p><p>He really didn\u2019t need anything else to distract him, but considering the near death experiences he had not long before, he agreed. \u201cAlright, send him in,\u201d he sighed.</p><p>Bucky could only watch from his cell as the others sifted through the items he\u2019d collected, hoping they could find the connection he failed to. His mind wandered to you, and though he wanted to ask FRIDAY if you were alright, he refrained from doing so knowing it would anger Tony even more.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark?\u201d Only Bucky heard Peter call timidly. \u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>The boy\u2019s face was splotched, his eyes red and glassy. You didn\u2019t need to be a spy to see the boy had been crying. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoah. Hey, Kid, are you hurt?\u201d Tony stepped away from the table to approach Peter and look him over. \u201cFRIDAY said you needed help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to see if Y/N was ok, but FRIDAY said she was on lockdown. Why is Sergeant Barnes in a cell?\u201d</p><p>Nat frowned at his statement. \u201cWhy were you worried about Y/N?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t answer the phone. I thought-\u201d he choked out a sob as his eyes began to fill with tears again. \u201cI was scared she\u2019d been at the diner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat diner?\u201d Steve asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine, Pete,\u201d Tony soothed. \u201cShe\u2019s in her room. What happened?\u201d</p><p>Peter stared blankly at them. \u201cMr. and Mrs. Carr\u2019s place. It\u2019s all over the n-hews,\u201d he sniffled. \u201cShe goes there all the time.\u201d</p><p>Tony vaguely remembered some story he\u2019d heard earlier, and his blood ran cold. \u201cFRIDAY, who owned the place that was massacred earlier today?\u201d</p><p>There was a silent moment while she searched for the information. \u201cSal and Barbara Carr.\u201d </p><p>Steve grabbed the note. \u201c<i>\u2018Skip school on Thursday and meet me at that diner you love.\u2019</i> You can\u2019t mean\u2026\u201d</p><p>Peter looked around at them all, confused. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDean\u2019s been in a coma.\u201d Sam turned to Bucky. \u201cWhere were you when I got there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting her breakfast a couple blocks away from the hospital. The Carr\u2019s place is on the other side of town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it couldn\u2019t have been you.\u201d Bucky shook his head in response. \u201cLet him out, Stark,\u201d Nat demanded. \u201cWhat do you know about the people who attacked the place, Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Um, there hasn\u2019t been a photo or composite done or anything like that, but a witness said it was one guy.\u201d</p><p>Tony grabbed his shoulders firmly. \u201cAre you sure? It wasn\u2019t like a gang or some organization?\u201d</p><p>Nat eased his grip off the boy. \u201cTony, if it were an organization, or anyone trying to get at you, they\u2019ve had plenty of chances to take her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d FRIDAY interrupted. \u201cA composite sketch of the killer has been released.\u201d </p><p>The hologram showed a sketch of man with unkempt hair and a large grin.</p><p>\u201cUm, Mr. Stark?\u201d Peter gaped at the image she\u2019d brought up. \u201cThat\u2019s the guy who pushed me off the platform at the station.\u201d</p><p>All eyes turned to Peter,</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Bucky asked, turning back to the drawing. \u201cBecause that guy nearly hit me with his car on Y/N\u2019s first day of school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean intentionally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems so if he went after you, too.\u201d</p><p>Tony watched Peter\u2019s reaction before taking another look at the composite. \u201cSo what, you\u2019re saying it\u2019s just some obsessed nutjob?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it is.\u201d Nat glared at the image. \u201cI have to go. I\u2019ll call you when I get something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright. Fine. One guy. I can handle that.\u201d Tony unlocked Bucky\u2019s cell, holding the door open for him as he stepped out. \u201cBarnes, Winchester, come with me. Pete, you and Cap fill the others in. Find out everything you can about this psycho.\u201d</p><p>In the elevator, Tony called Pepper to send for an ambulance, then called for your security team to meet in the garage. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your plan?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving and taking her with you.\u201d He stepped out of the garage, pleased to see the guards ready to get to work. \u201cI need you all to take a drive.\u201d He grabbed a set of keys and tossed them to a guard. \u201cWinchester, you and Y/N will go with him to the compound upstate and wait there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I need you to be my backup,\u201d Tony said. \u201cWhere she goes, you follow. I need you to be seen far away from her.\u201d</p><p>Bucky reluctantly followed him back into the elevator, his mind still trying to wrap around the situation. \u201cYou sure she\u2019ll be safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he replied, not looking at him. \u201cOnce its released she\u2019s been injured and taken to the hospital, he\u2019ll be headed there while she\u2019ll be headed upstate.\u201d </p><p>He could feel the nervous energy radiating off him. He also figured he probably owed him an apology, but the thought left a bad taste in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cAre ya gonna tell her?\u201d</p><p>Tony rubbed the side of his face. He was tired, and he was afraid. And now he was about to ruin everything he\u2019d been working for to build an amicable relationship with you. \u201cNo. You\u2019re right, she\u2019ll just get scared.\u201d Bucky nodded, but stayed silent, and Tony should have felt a little bad. \u201cYou know what you have to do, don\u2019t you? What this means?\u201d</p><p>Bucky\u2019s eyes darted to his feet, but again he nodded. \u201cIt means she\u2019s gonna hate me.\u201d</p><p>Tony instinctively reached out to give him a comforting pat, but pulled his hand back, scoffing internally. Instead, he offered, \u00a0\u201cI wish there was another way.\u201d And to his surprise, it sounded almost sincere.</p><p>The doors opened on your floor, and Bucky followed Tony out. The two took a deep breath, waiting for the other\u2019s go ahead before knocking.</p><p>You flung the door open, and they pushed past you before you could feel any relief at seeing they weren\u2019t about to fight anymore. Tony grabbed an empty bag from your closet, and Bucky was pulling everything out of your backpack. </p><p>\u201cWhat was all that about earlier? Is everything alright? What are you doing?\u201d You watched in horror as they began to fill the bags with the contents of your closet and dresser. \u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d</p><p>Neither of them said anything, just carried on packing as much as they could in the bags. You ran to Tony and tried to grab your bag from him, but he turned to keep you from grabbing it as he ignored your demands to know what was happening.</p><p>\u201cBucky,\u201d you pleaded, running over to him and yanking the backpack from his grasp. \u201cBucky, please! Why are you doing this?!\u201d His silence stung, but his sudden inability to even look at you was what really hurt. \u201cPlease, talk to me,\u201d you begged. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d </p><p>He took hold of the bag, but you weren\u2019t going to let it go that easily. He tugged on it and turned, jolting you forward at an angle, and pushed you hard enough to send you stumbling against your bed. He zipped the bag and placed it by the door, grabbing another to fill, doing his best to ignore the betrayed look in your eyes. </p><p>When they\u2019d gathered enough of your things, Tony grabbed your arm to lead you out. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going away for a while,\u201d was all he supplied. \u201cAnd I need your phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell! You can\u2019t take my phone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it.\u201d As soon as he spoke the words, you felt Bucky snatch it from your pocket and placed it in his own.</p><p>You knew you weren\u2019t getting it back, no matter how hard you tried. Now you had no way to contact your mother. \u201cMy mom,\u201d you swallowed back a lump. \u201cDoes\u2026 did she plan this with you? Was this always meant to be the arrangement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d Tony snapped, clearly offended at the insinuation. \u201cYou just can\u2019t be here right now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you bring me here if you were just going to send me away?! If you were going to pull this shit, you could have just left me at home! I was happy there!\u201d You yanked your arm from his grasp, turning to Bucky. \u201cAnd what about you?\u201d your voice cracked. \u201cI thought we were friends\u2026\u201d</p><p>Bucky didn\u2019t answer, and Tony ushered you into the elevator, the ride down to the garage quiet except for your occasional sniffle. You were taken to the car where Sam was waiting, and your bags were put in the trunk.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Sam opened the door for you, \u201cget in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it you\u2019re not going to tell me anything either?\u201d you snapped. \u201cDo you eve-\u201d</p><p>The sound of approaching sirens interrupted, and you turned to the others for an explanation when an ambulance drove into the garage. You began to grow concerned when Bucky shoved your backpack into your arms and pushed you into the car, blocking your view of the vehicle. </p><p>It wasn\u2019t long until the ambulance returned, speeding past your car as it left the building. Tony made a call as Bucky blocked the door, and Sam climbed into the seat beside you. Tony stayed on the phone for nearly half an hour, but you couldn\u2019t hear a word of it.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Barnes, we need to go to the hospital!\u201d he called after hanging up. </p><p>Bucky took a last glance back at you, only vaguely making out your angry face behind the tinted window. You opened your backpack as the car started and made its way to the exit, hoping your earbuds were left inside. Though you didn\u2019t have anything to plug them into, you hoped they\u2019d be enough to let Sam know you were in no mood to speak to him. There was a picture frame at the top. Though the car was moving and you were already halfway outside, you swung the door open, causing the car to stop and Sam to reach out to grab you, but he was too late. </p><p>Tony\u2019s car screeched to a halt just behind yours, but it was Bucky who stepped out.</p><p>\u201cGet back in the car!\u201d he ordered.</p><p>His tone stopped you in your tracks. He\u2019d never shouted at you before, and it only made you angrier. Rather than hand him the frame back like you\u2019d intended, you threw it at his feet, shattering the glass.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole! I never want to see you again!\u201d Without waiting for a response, you climbed back into the car, allowing it to take you wherever it was meant to.</p><p>Tony watched Bucky stare after your car as it drove away, only pulling the photo from the broken frame once it was out of sight. He got in the car and shoved it into the glove compartment before Tony could see it, and they headed toward the hospital.</p><p>\u201cThink anyone saw her?\u201d he asked, forcing his voice to be steady.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tony assured him. \u201cEven if they did, the guy\u2019s probably already halfway to the hospital anyway.\u201d</p><p>Bucky hummed in understanding, hoping he was right. The rest of the trip was made in silence, the tension growing thicker with every minute that passed.</p><p>He dropped Bucky off at the front of the ER, where there was already press waiting. That was the plan; to be seen there so everyone and the crazy man would think that\u2019s where you were as you were taken elsewhere.</p><p>Tony parked the car, and didn\u2019t hesitate to open the glovebox to see what you\u2019d thrown at Bucky. He pulled out the photo and stared.</p><p>You were wearing one of his helmets. Not Bucky\u2019s tactical gear, or Sam\u2019s wings, or holding Steve\u2019s shield, but <i>his</i> helmet. You held a ridiculously heroic pose as Bucky lay on the floor, trying and failing to hide his amusement.</p><p>The jealousy he\u2019d come to expect didn\u2019t wash over him as it usually did. Instead, he was filled with a sadness over your having lost yet another person you trusted. He even felt a little guilty over making Bucky betray you like he did. He could have had anyone else go with him to gather your things, but the sick satisfaction he thought he\u2019d get over watching your bond sever was too much to resist.</p><p>Tony stuffed the picture back in the glove box, and started walking toward the entrance. With every step, his resolve grew; when this was over and you were safe, he\u2019d apologize to Bucky. Maybe he\u2019d even begin to try to make amends with him.</p><p>\u201cFRIDAY, tell the others to suit up and start searching the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, you bastard,\u201d he murmured as the reporters waved him over. \u201cLet\u2019s see you try to come for her now.\u201d</p><figure data-orig-width=\"332\" data-orig-height=\"318\"

The door swung open, and your worry was replaced with anger when you saw the state of your bedroom. You had half a mind to go back and demand to know why Tony had gone through your things, but Bucky hadn\u2019t wanted you in the room. You had a sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach when you wondered if it had anything to do with what Sam had told you. </p><p>Doing as asked, you shut the door behind you and locked it. You pulled your phone out and noticed several messages and missed calls from Peter. Ignoring them for the time being, you started scrolling through your contacts, pausing briefly when his name came up. You were tempted to call, and had it been anyone else confronting Bucky, you would have. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d just make excuses for Tony,\u201d you muttered, scrolling past. You found the name you wanted and pressed it, hoping he wasn\u2019t too busy to pick up.</p><p><i>\u201cHey, Y/N!\u201d</i> Steve greeted cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cBucky\u2019s in trouble,\u201d you blurted, forgoing niceties. \u201cTony\u2019s armed and <i>super</i> pissed at him.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p><p>Neither man said a word as you reluctantly shuffled to your room, waiting until they heard the bolt lock to speak.</p><p>\u201cAnything you wanna say to me, Barnes?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot here. She might be listening at the door.\u201d </p><p>He hesitated, knowing Bucky would be more of a challenge in close quarters. \u201cI think not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on,\u201d he ignored Tony\u2019s scoff, \u201cbut I have an idea and I just don\u2019t want her scared. Nothing funny. You have my word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour word means <i>nothing</i>. FRIDAY, if he tries anything, sound the alarm.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026 Of course. Where to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe holding cells.\u201d</p><p>Bucky stepped back into the corner, trying to appear passive. Tony entered, sticking to the opposite corner and growing tense when the doors closed behind him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this about?\u201d he gestured to the book.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to ask questions!\u201d Tony snapped. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?!\u201d</p><p>Bucky was tired. Almost tired enough to tell Tony everything on the spot. <i>Almost</i>. \u201cI need you to tell me first why we have this. Please, it\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, his helmet retracting, but his blaster still aimed at his chest. \u201cAbout two-thirds in, I found your note.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat note?\u201d Alarmed, Bucky immediately began flipping through the pages until he came across the slip of paper. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not buying your little act.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d he hissed, skimming the letter. \u201cSomething\u2019s off\u2026\u201d</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes, growing tired of the charade. \u201cNo shi-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand. This doesn\u2019t make sense\u2026\u201d Bucky turned to him, his eyes begging. \u201cWe need to go to my room. I have something to show you.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cStark! What are you doing? Buck, are you alright?\u201d</i> Steve\u2019s frantic voice came from the speaker. </p><p>\u201cNot for long,\u201d Tony said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask your buddy what he\u2019s been up to? What plans he had for my daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>What are you talking about?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t write this,\u201d Bucky defended. \u201cBut I know who did. Steve, go to my room. In the closet, I have a cardboard box with various items. Bring it to the holding cells.\u201d</p><p>Bucky waited for Tony to step out and get some distance before making a move. He went in the direction Tony gestured, hoping Steve would hurry.</p><p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p><p>Satisfied with the armed guards stood outside Dean\u2019s room and patrolling the hospital grounds, Sam returned to the tower and was promptly led toward the elevator. The guard informed FRIDAY that he was to be taken to Tony, and went back to his duties, leaving Sam alone. </p><p>When the elevator stopped and the doors opened, he made to step out, but was stopped by FRIDAY.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t your stop, Mr. Winchester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWinchester?\u201d the man who stepped inside asked. \u201cRelative of Dean\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>Sam would recognize Captain America anywhere, and had the situation been any different, he\u2019d have been ecstatic to meet him. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s my brother,\u201d he replied coldly. </p><p>And, had the situation been any different, Steve would\u2019ve made more of an effort to be polite. \u201cI wish him a speedy recovery.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stop the words from spilling. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Sam shrugged, \u201cthings won\u2019t be so good for your friend when Dean wakes up, will they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour floor, Mr. Winchester,\u201d FRIDAY said, interrupting their chat.</p><p>Sam stormed out, not giving the man following him a second glance as he approached Tony and Bucky. The latter was sitting calmly in a cell as Tony paced. </p><p>\u201cHere are the things you asked for, Buck.\u201d Steve dropped the box at Tony\u2019s feet, glaring at him. \u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Nat\u2019s voice rang from the stairs.</p><p>Tony huffed in annoyance. \u201cWhat are you doing here, Romanoff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteve called for backup.\u201d She pulled up a chair and settled in, crossing her arms. \u201c<i>Now </i>explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarnes has been planning to elope with Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were!\u201d Tony snapped, handing the letter to Natasha. \u201cRead that for Cap and Sam.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, but did as asked.</p><p>\u201c<b><i>\u2018My pretty little Y/N,</i></b></p><p><b><i>It\u2019s time. You looked uncomfortable in the purple ball gown. Did you enjoy my gifts? They\u2019re perfect aren\u2019t they? I\u2019m tired of the secrecy and I can see you are too. We know we belong together. Who would\u2019ve guessed your coming to New York would change everything? Are you free on Thursday? I can buy us an island where no one will find us. Pack the black shorts with the ladybugs on them. Skip school on Thursday and meet me at that diner you love. Why wait any lon-\u2019</i></b></p><p>You think Bucky wrote this? Tony, this is all over the place. Whoever wrote it, their mind is scattered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, do we know for certain Frosty here\u2019s not still got something scrambled in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Tony!\u201d Steve barked. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d All eyes turned to Sam. \u201cAnd Dean found out, didn\u2019t he? That\u2019s why you shot him.\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for anyone to respond before playing the voicemail Dean left. </p><p>Slowly, everyone\u2019s gazes shifted to Bucky. \u201cI- I didn\u2019t. I was in the tower all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you prove it?\u201d Steve asked, desperation in his voice.</p><p>\u201cFRIDAY, can you corroborate Barnes regarding his whereabouts last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Agent Romanoff.\u201d Several surveillance holograms appeared, each showing Bucky had indeed not left the tower.</p><p>Sam swallowed thickly. \u201cCould he have altered the footage?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot without me or Tony to help him, and I did no such thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk, so maybe he didn\u2019t try to kill Dean,\u201d Tony admitted, \u201cbut he still wrote that note!\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept this isn\u2019t Bucky\u2019s writing,\u201d Nat persisted. </p><p>Tony scoffed. \u201cPlease. Aren\u2019t you guys trained to disguise yourselves in every form? It was in the book he gave her!\u201d</p><p>Nat didn\u2019t have an answer for that, so she turned to Steve.</p><p>\u201cBuck, how did that note get in there?\u201d</p><p>Sam shook his head in disappointment at Steve\u2019s willingness to turn a blind eye when it came to his oldest friend.</p><p>\u201cThe book wasn\u2019t from me,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIt was from Dean. Everything in that box, all the gifts, the flowers, that was all Dean.\u201d</p><p>Natasha grabbed the box as Steve went to fetch a table.</p><p>\u201cWhen the package came, you said it was meant as an apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s convenient,\u201d Sam muttered. \u201cHow do you explain the message he left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo shift the blame!\u201d Bucky turned his glare on Sam. \u201cI wanted to confirm it was your brother sending it. And guess what? He was angry I\u2019d taken the credit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you hear yourself?! If he was angry it\u2019s because he knew you were up to something!\u201d He snatched the note from the top of the box Nat was holding and scanned it. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Dean\u2019s writing, either! And don\u2019t tell me he could disguise it this well!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe coulda had someone else write it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you could have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot helping right now, guys,\u201d Nat called. \u201cLet\u2019s look this stuff over and see if we can\u2019t find any clues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, Peter Parker wishes to speak to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now, FRIDAY.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe insists. He\u2019s in distress.\u201d</p><p>He really didn\u2019t need anything else to distract him, but considering the near death experiences he had not long before, he agreed. \u201cAlright, send him in,\u201d he sighed.</p><p>Bucky could only watch from his cell as the others sifted through the items he\u2019d collected, hoping they could find the connection he failed to. His mind wandered to you, and though he wanted to ask FRIDAY if you were alright, he refrained from doing so knowing it would anger Tony even more.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark?\u201d Only Bucky heard Peter call timidly. \u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>The boy\u2019s face was splotched, his eyes red and glassy. You didn\u2019t need to be a spy to see the boy had been crying. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoah. Hey, Kid, are you hurt?\u201d Tony stepped away from the table to approach Peter and look him over. \u201cFRIDAY said you needed help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to see if Y/N was ok, but FRIDAY said she was on lockdown. Why is Sergeant Barnes in a cell?\u201d</p><p>Nat frowned at his statement. \u201cWhy were you worried about Y/N?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t answer the phone. I thought-\u201d he choked out a sob as his eyes began to fill with tears again. \u201cI was scared she\u2019d been at the diner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat diner?\u201d Steve asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine, Pete,\u201d Tony soothed. \u201cShe\u2019s in her room. What happened?\u201d</p><p>Peter stared blankly at them. \u201cMr. and Mrs. Carr\u2019s place. It\u2019s all over the n-hews,\u201d he sniffled. \u201cShe goes there all the time.\u201d</p><p>Tony vaguely remembered some story he\u2019d heard earlier, and his blood ran cold. \u201cFRIDAY, who owned the place that was massacred earlier today?\u201d</p><p>There was a silent moment while she searched for the information. \u201cSal and Barbara Carr.\u201d </p><p>Steve grabbed the note. \u201c<i>\u2018Skip school on Thursday and meet me at that diner you love.\u2019</i> You can\u2019t mean\u2026\u201d</p><p>Peter looked around at them all, confused. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDean\u2019s been in a coma.\u201d Sam turned to Bucky. \u201cWhere were you when I got there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting her breakfast a couple blocks away from the hospital. The Carr\u2019s place is on the other side of town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it couldn\u2019t have been you.\u201d Bucky shook his head in response. \u201cLet him out, Stark,\u201d Nat demanded. \u201cWhat do you know about the people who attacked the place, Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Um, there hasn\u2019t been a photo or composite done or anything like that, but a witness said it was one guy.\u201d</p><p>Tony grabbed his shoulders firmly. \u201cAre you sure? It wasn\u2019t like a gang or some organization?\u201d</p><p>Nat eased his grip off the boy. \u201cTony, if it were an organization, or anyone trying to get at you, they\u2019ve had plenty of chances to take her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d FRIDAY interrupted. \u201cA composite sketch of the killer has been released.\u201d </p><p>The hologram showed a sketch of man with unkempt hair and a large grin.</p><p>\u201cUm, Mr. Stark?\u201d Peter gaped at the image she\u2019d brought up. \u201cThat\u2019s the guy who pushed me off the platform at the station.\u201d</p><p>All eyes turned to Peter,</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Bucky asked, turning back to the drawing. \u201cBecause that guy nearly hit me with his car on Y/N\u2019s first day of school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean intentionally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems so if he went after you, too.\u201d</p><p>Tony watched Peter\u2019s reaction before taking another look at the composite. \u201cSo what, you\u2019re saying it\u2019s just some obsessed nutjob?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it is.\u201d Nat glared at the image. \u201cI have to go. I\u2019ll call you when I get something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright. Fine. One guy. I can handle that.\u201d Tony unlocked Bucky\u2019s cell, holding the door open for him as he stepped out. \u201cBarnes, Winchester, come with me. Pete, you and Cap fill the others in. Find out everything you can about this psycho.\u201d</p><p>In the elevator, Tony called Pepper to send for an ambulance, then called for your security team to meet in the garage. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your plan?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving and taking her with you.\u201d He stepped out of the garage, pleased to see the guards ready to get to work. \u201cI need you all to take a drive.\u201d He grabbed a set of keys and tossed them to a guard. \u201cWinchester, you and Y/N will go with him to the compound upstate and wait there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I need you to be my backup,\u201d Tony said. \u201cWhere she goes, you follow. I need you to be seen far away from her.\u201d</p><p>Bucky reluctantly followed him back into the elevator, his mind still trying to wrap around the situation. \u201cYou sure she\u2019ll be safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he replied, not looking at him. \u201cOnce its released she\u2019s been injured and taken to the hospital, he\u2019ll be headed there while she\u2019ll be headed upstate.\u201d </p><p>He could feel the nervous energy radiating off him. He also figured he probably owed him an apology, but the thought left a bad taste in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cAre ya gonna tell her?\u201d</p><p>Tony rubbed the side of his face. He was tired, and he was afraid. And now he was about to ruin everything he\u2019d been working for to build an amicable relationship with you. \u201cNo. You\u2019re right, she\u2019ll just get scared.\u201d Bucky nodded, but stayed silent, and Tony should have felt a little bad. \u201cYou know what you have to do, don\u2019t you? What this means?\u201d</p><p>Bucky\u2019s eyes darted to his feet, but again he nodded. \u201cIt means she\u2019s gonna hate me.\u201d</p><p>Tony instinctively reached out to give him a comforting pat, but pulled his hand back, scoffing internally. Instead, he offered, \u00a0\u201cI wish there was another way.\u201d And to his surprise, it sounded almost sincere.</p><p>The doors opened on your floor, and Bucky followed Tony out. The two took a deep breath, waiting for the other\u2019s go ahead before knocking.</p><p>You flung the door open, and they pushed past you before you could feel any relief at seeing they weren\u2019t about to fight anymore. Tony grabbed an empty bag from your closet, and Bucky was pulling everything out of your backpack. </p><p>\u201cWhat was all that about earlier? Is everything alright? What are you doing?\u201d You watched in horror as they began to fill the bags with the contents of your closet and dresser. \u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d</p><p>Neither of them said anything, just carried on packing as much as they could in the bags. You ran to Tony and tried to grab your bag from him, but he turned to keep you from grabbing it as he ignored your demands to know what was happening.</p><p>\u201cBucky,\u201d you pleaded, running over to him and yanking the backpack from his grasp. \u201cBucky, please! Why are you doing this?!\u201d His silence stung, but his sudden inability to even look at you was what really hurt. \u201cPlease, talk to me,\u201d you begged. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d </p><p>He took hold of the bag, but you weren\u2019t going to let it go that easily. He tugged on it and turned, jolting you forward at an angle, and pushed you hard enough to send you stumbling against your bed. He zipped the bag and placed it by the door, grabbing another to fill, doing his best to ignore the betrayed look in your eyes. </p><p>When they\u2019d gathered enough of your things, Tony grabbed your arm to lead you out. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going away for a while,\u201d was all he supplied. \u201cAnd I need your phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell! You can\u2019t take my phone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it.\u201d As soon as he spoke the words, you felt Bucky snatch it from your pocket and placed it in his own.</p><p>You knew you weren\u2019t getting it back, no matter how hard you tried. Now you had no way to contact your mother. \u201cMy mom,\u201d you swallowed back a lump. \u201cDoes\u2026 did she plan this with you? Was this always meant to be the arrangement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d Tony snapped, clearly offended at the insinuation. \u201cYou just can\u2019t be here right now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you bring me here if you were just going to send me away?! If you were going to pull this shit, you could have just left me at home! I was happy there!\u201d You yanked your arm from his grasp, turning to Bucky. \u201cAnd what about you?\u201d your voice cracked. \u201cI thought we were friends\u2026\u201d</p><p>Bucky didn\u2019t answer, and Tony ushered you into the elevator, the ride down to the garage quiet except for your occasional sniffle. You were taken to the car where Sam was waiting, and your bags were put in the trunk.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Sam opened the door for you, \u201cget in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it you\u2019re not going to tell me anything either?\u201d you snapped. \u201cDo you eve-\u201d</p><p>The sound of approaching sirens interrupted, and you turned to the others for an explanation when an ambulance drove into the garage. You began to grow concerned when Bucky shoved your backpack into your arms and pushed you into the car, blocking your view of the vehicle. </p><p>It wasn\u2019t long until the ambulance returned, speeding past your car as it left the building. Tony made a call as Bucky blocked the door, and Sam climbed into the seat beside you. Tony stayed on the phone for nearly half an hour, but you couldn\u2019t hear a word of it.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Barnes, we need to go to the hospital!\u201d he called after hanging up. </p><p>Bucky took a last glance back at you, only vaguely making out your angry face behind the tinted window. You opened your backpack as the car started and made its way to the exit, hoping your earbuds were left inside. Though you didn\u2019t have anything to plug them into, you hoped they\u2019d be enough to let Sam know you were in no mood to speak to him. There was a picture frame at the top. Though the car was moving and you were already halfway outside, you swung the door open, causing the car to stop and Sam to reach out to grab you, but he was too late. </p><p>Tony\u2019s car screeched to a halt just behind yours, but it was Bucky who stepped out.</p><p>\u201cGet back in the car!\u201d he ordered.</p><p>His tone stopped you in your tracks. He\u2019d never shouted at you before, and it only made you angrier. Rather than hand him the frame back like you\u2019d intended, you threw it at his feet, shattering the glass.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole! I never want to see you again!\u201d Without waiting for a response, you climbed back into the car, allowing it to take you wherever it was meant to.</p><p>Tony watched Bucky stare after your car as it drove away, only pulling the photo from the broken frame once it was out of sight. He got in the car and shoved it into the glove compartment before Tony could see it, and they headed toward the hospital.</p><p>\u201cThink anyone saw her?\u201d he asked, forcing his voice to be steady.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tony assured him. \u201cEven if they did, the guy\u2019s probably already halfway to the hospital anyway.\u201d</p><p>Bucky hummed in understanding, hoping he was right. The rest of the trip was made in silence, the tension growing thicker with every minute that passed.</p><p>He dropped Bucky off at the front of the ER, where there was already press waiting. That was the plan; to be seen there so everyone and the crazy man would think that\u2019s where you were as you were taken elsewhere.</p><p>Tony parked the car, and didn\u2019t hesitate to open the glovebox to see what you\u2019d thrown at Bucky. He pulled out the photo and stared.</p><p>You were wearing one of his helmets. Not Bucky\u2019s tactical gear, or Sam\u2019s wings, or holding Steve\u2019s shield, but <i>his</i> helmet. You held a ridiculously heroic pose as Bucky lay on the floor, trying and failing to hide his amusement.</p><p>The jealousy he\u2019d come to expect didn\u2019t wash over him as it usually did. Instead, he was filled with a sadness over your having lost yet another person you trusted. He even felt a little guilty over making Bucky betray you like he did. He could have had anyone else go with him to gather your things, but the sick satisfaction he thought he\u2019d get over watching your bond sever was too much to resist.</p><p>Tony stuffed the picture back in the glove box, and started walking toward the entrance. With every step, his resolve grew; when this was over and you were safe, he\u2019d apologize to Bucky. Maybe he\u2019d even begin to try to make amends with him.</p><p>\u201cFRIDAY, tell the others to suit up and start searching the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, you bastard,\u201d he murmured as the reporters waved him over. \u201cLet\u2019s see you try to come for her now.\u201d</p><figure data-orig-width=\"332\" data-orig-height=\"318\"

The door swung open, and your worry was replaced with anger when you saw the state of your bedroom. You had half a mind to go back and demand to know why Tony had gone through your things, but Bucky hadn&rsquo;t wanted you in the room. You had a sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach when you wondered if it had anything to do with what Sam had told you. </p><p>Doing as asked, you shut the door behind you and locked it. You pulled your phone out and noticed several messages and missed calls from Peter. Ignoring them for the time being, you started scrolling through your contacts, pausing briefly when his name came up. You were tempted to call, and had it been anyone else confronting Bucky, you would have. </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d just make excuses for Tony,&rdquo; you muttered, scrolling past. You found the name you wanted and pressed it, hoping he wasn&rsquo;t too busy to pick up.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Hey, Y/N!&rdquo;</i> Steve greeted cheerfully.</p><p>&ldquo;Bucky&rsquo;s in trouble,&rdquo; you blurted, forgoing niceties. &ldquo;Tony&rsquo;s armed and <i>super</i> pissed at him.&rdquo;</p><p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p><p>Neither man said a word as you reluctantly shuffled to your room, waiting until they heard the bolt lock to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;Anything you wanna say to me, Barnes?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Not here. She might be listening at the door.&rdquo; </p><p>He hesitated, knowing Bucky would be more of a challenge in close quarters. &ldquo;I think not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on,&rdquo; he ignored Tony&rsquo;s scoff, &ldquo;but I have an idea and I just don&rsquo;t want her scared. Nothing funny. You have my word.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your word means <i>nothing</i>. FRIDAY, if he tries anything, sound the alarm.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip; Of course. Where to?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The holding cells.&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky stepped back into the corner, trying to appear passive. Tony entered, sticking to the opposite corner and growing tense when the doors closed behind him.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this about?&rdquo; he gestured to the book.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get to ask questions!&rdquo; Tony snapped. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with you?!&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky was tired. Almost tired enough to tell Tony everything on the spot. <i>Almost</i>. &ldquo;I need you to tell me first why we have this. Please, it&rsquo;s important.&rdquo;</p><p>He sighed, his helmet retracting, but his blaster still aimed at his chest. &ldquo;About two-thirds in, I found your note.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What note?&rdquo; Alarmed, Bucky immediately began flipping through the pages until he came across the slip of paper. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not buying your little act.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; he hissed, skimming the letter. &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s off&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes, growing tired of the charade. &ldquo;No shi-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t understand. This doesn&rsquo;t make sense&hellip;&rdquo; Bucky turned to him, his eyes begging. &ldquo;We need to go to my room. I have something to show you.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Stark! What are you doing? Buck, are you alright?&rdquo;</i> Steve&rsquo;s frantic voice came from the speaker. </p><p>&ldquo;Not for long,&rdquo; Tony said. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ask your buddy what he&rsquo;s been up to? What plans he had for my daughter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>What are you talking about?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t write this,&rdquo; Bucky defended. &ldquo;But I know who did. Steve, go to my room. In the closet, I have a cardboard box with various items. Bring it to the holding cells.&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky waited for Tony to step out and get some distance before making a move. He went in the direction Tony gestured, hoping Steve would hurry.</p><p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p><p>Satisfied with the armed guards stood outside Dean&rsquo;s room and patrolling the hospital grounds, Sam returned to the tower and was promptly led toward the elevator. The guard informed FRIDAY that he was to be taken to Tony, and went back to his duties, leaving Sam alone. </p><p>When the elevator stopped and the doors opened, he made to step out, but was stopped by FRIDAY.</p><p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t your stop, Mr. Winchester.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Winchester?&rdquo; the man who stepped inside asked. &ldquo;Relative of Dean&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p><p>Sam would recognize Captain America anywhere, and had the situation been any different, he&rsquo;d have been ecstatic to meet him. &ldquo;Yeah, he&rsquo;s my brother,&rdquo; he replied coldly. </p><p>And, had the situation been any different, Steve would&rsquo;ve made more of an effort to be polite. &ldquo;I wish him a speedy recovery.&rdquo;</p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t stop the words from spilling. &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that supposed to mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Sam shrugged, &ldquo;things won&rsquo;t be so good for your friend when Dean wakes up, will they?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your floor, Mr. Winchester,&rdquo; FRIDAY said, interrupting their chat.</p><p>Sam stormed out, not giving the man following him a second glance as he approached Tony and Bucky. The latter was sitting calmly in a cell as Tony paced. </p><p>&ldquo;Here are the things you asked for, Buck.&rdquo; Steve dropped the box at Tony&rsquo;s feet, glaring at him. &ldquo;Explain.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; Nat&rsquo;s voice rang from the stairs.</p><p>Tony huffed in annoyance. &ldquo;What are you doing here, Romanoff?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Steve called for backup.&rdquo; She pulled up a chair and settled in, crossing her arms. &ldquo;<i>Now </i>explain.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Barnes has been planning to elope with Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You were!&rdquo; Tony snapped, handing the letter to Natasha. &ldquo;Read that for Cap and Sam.&rdquo;</p><p>She frowned, but did as asked.</p><p>&ldquo;<b><i>&lsquo;My pretty little Y/N,</i></b></p><p><b><i>It&rsquo;s time. You looked uncomfortable in the purple ball gown. Did you enjoy my gifts? They&rsquo;re perfect aren&rsquo;t they? I&rsquo;m tired of the secrecy and I can see you are too. We know we belong together. Who would&rsquo;ve guessed your coming to New York would change everything? Are you free on Thursday? I can buy us an island where no one will find us. Pack the black shorts with the ladybugs on them. Skip school on Thursday and meet me at that diner you love. Why wait any lon-&rsquo;</i></b></p><p>You think Bucky wrote this? Tony, this is all over the place. Whoever wrote it, their mind is scattered.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, do we know for certain Frosty here&rsquo;s not still got something scrambled in there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough, Tony!&rdquo; Steve barked. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true.&rdquo; All eyes turned to Sam. &ldquo;And Dean found out, didn&rsquo;t he? That&rsquo;s why you shot him.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t wait for anyone to respond before playing the voicemail Dean left. </p><p>Slowly, everyone&rsquo;s gazes shifted to Bucky. &ldquo;I- I didn&rsquo;t. I was in the tower all night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can you prove it?&rdquo; Steve asked, desperation in his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;FRIDAY, can you corroborate Barnes regarding his whereabouts last night?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, Agent Romanoff.&rdquo; Several surveillance holograms appeared, each showing Bucky had indeed not left the tower.</p><p>Sam swallowed thickly. &ldquo;Could he have altered the footage?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Not without me or Tony to help him, and I did no such thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok, so maybe he didn&rsquo;t try to kill Dean,&rdquo; Tony admitted, &ldquo;but he still wrote that note!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Except this isn&rsquo;t Bucky&rsquo;s writing,&rdquo; Nat persisted. </p><p>Tony scoffed. &ldquo;Please. Aren&rsquo;t you guys trained to disguise yourselves in every form? It was in the book he gave her!&rdquo;</p><p>Nat didn&rsquo;t have an answer for that, so she turned to Steve.</p><p>&ldquo;Buck, how did that note get in there?&rdquo;</p><p>Sam shook his head in disappointment at Steve&rsquo;s willingness to turn a blind eye when it came to his oldest friend.</p><p>&ldquo;The book wasn&rsquo;t from me,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;It was from Dean. Everything in that box, all the gifts, the flowers, that was all Dean.&rdquo;</p><p>Natasha grabbed the box as Steve went to fetch a table.</p><p>&ldquo;When the package came, you said it was meant as an apology.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I lied.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s convenient,&rdquo; Sam muttered. &ldquo;How do you explain the message he left?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To shift the blame!&rdquo; Bucky turned his glare on Sam. &ldquo;I wanted to confirm it was your brother sending it. And guess what? He was angry I&rsquo;d taken the credit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you hear yourself?! If he was angry it&rsquo;s because he knew you were up to something!&rdquo; He snatched the note from the top of the box Nat was holding and scanned it. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t Dean&rsquo;s writing, either! And don&rsquo;t tell me he could disguise it this well!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He coulda had someone else write it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Or you could have.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not helping right now, guys,&rdquo; Nat called. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look this stuff over and see if we can&rsquo;t find any clues.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sir, Peter Parker wishes to speak to you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not now, FRIDAY.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He insists. He&rsquo;s in distress.&rdquo;</p><p>He really didn&rsquo;t need anything else to distract him, but considering the near death experiences he had not long before, he agreed. &ldquo;Alright, send him in,&rdquo; he sighed.</p><p>Bucky could only watch from his cell as the others sifted through the items he&rsquo;d collected, hoping they could find the connection he failed to. His mind wandered to you, and though he wanted to ask FRIDAY if you were alright, he refrained from doing so knowing it would anger Tony even more.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark?&rdquo; Only Bucky heard Peter call timidly. &nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p><p>The boy&rsquo;s face was splotched, his eyes red and glassy. You didn&rsquo;t need to be a spy to see the boy had been crying. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Woah. Hey, Kid, are you hurt?&rdquo; Tony stepped away from the table to approach Peter and look him over. &ldquo;FRIDAY said you needed help.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I came to see if Y/N was ok, but FRIDAY said she was on lockdown. Why is Sergeant Barnes in a cell?&rdquo;</p><p>Nat frowned at his statement. &ldquo;Why were you worried about Y/N?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t answer the phone. I thought-&rdquo; he choked out a sob as his eyes began to fill with tears again. &ldquo;I was scared she&rsquo;d been at the diner.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What diner?&rdquo; Steve asked.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s fine, Pete,&rdquo; Tony soothed. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s in her room. What happened?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter stared blankly at them. &ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Carr&rsquo;s place. It&rsquo;s all over the n-hews,&rdquo; he sniffled. &ldquo;She goes there all the time.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony vaguely remembered some story he&rsquo;d heard earlier, and his blood ran cold. &ldquo;FRIDAY, who owned the place that was massacred earlier today?&rdquo;</p><p>There was a silent moment while she searched for the information. &ldquo;Sal and Barbara Carr.&rdquo; </p><p>Steve grabbed the note. &ldquo;<i>&lsquo;Skip school on Thursday and meet me at that diner you love.&rsquo;</i> You can&rsquo;t mean&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Peter looked around at them all, confused. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dean&rsquo;s been in a coma.&rdquo; Sam turned to Bucky. &ldquo;Where were you when I got there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Getting her breakfast a couple blocks away from the hospital. The Carr&rsquo;s place is on the other side of town.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So it couldn&rsquo;t have been you.&rdquo; Bucky shook his head in response. &ldquo;Let him out, Stark,&rdquo; Nat demanded. &ldquo;What do you know about the people who attacked the place, Peter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing. Um, there hasn&rsquo;t been a photo or composite done or anything like that, but a witness said it was one guy.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony grabbed his shoulders firmly. &ldquo;Are you sure? It wasn&rsquo;t like a gang or some organization?&rdquo;</p><p>Nat eased his grip off the boy. &ldquo;Tony, if it were an organization, or anyone trying to get at you, they&rsquo;ve had plenty of chances to take her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sir?&rdquo; FRIDAY interrupted. &ldquo;A composite sketch of the killer has been released.&rdquo; </p><p>The hologram showed a sketch of man with unkempt hair and a large grin.</p><p>&ldquo;Um, Mr. Stark?&rdquo; Peter gaped at the image she&rsquo;d brought up. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the guy who pushed me off the platform at the station.&rdquo;</p><p>All eyes turned to Peter,</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; Bucky asked, turning back to the drawing. &ldquo;Because that guy nearly hit me with his car on Y/N&rsquo;s first day of school.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You mean intentionally?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Seems so if he went after you, too.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony watched Peter&rsquo;s reaction before taking another look at the composite. &ldquo;So what, you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s just some obsessed nutjob?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think it is.&rdquo; Nat glared at the image. &ldquo;I have to go. I&rsquo;ll call you when I get something.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright. Fine. One guy. I can handle that.&rdquo; Tony unlocked Bucky&rsquo;s cell, holding the door open for him as he stepped out. &ldquo;Barnes, Winchester, come with me. Pete, you and Cap fill the others in. Find out everything you can about this psycho.&rdquo;</p><p>In the elevator, Tony called Pepper to send for an ambulance, then called for your security team to meet in the garage. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your plan?&rdquo; Sam asked.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re leaving and taking her with you.&rdquo; He stepped out of the garage, pleased to see the guards ready to get to work. &ldquo;I need you all to take a drive.&rdquo; He grabbed a set of keys and tossed them to a guard. &ldquo;Winchester, you and Y/N will go with him to the compound upstate and wait there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I need you to be my backup,&rdquo; Tony said. &ldquo;Where she goes, you follow. I need you to be seen far away from her.&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky reluctantly followed him back into the elevator, his mind still trying to wrap around the situation. &ldquo;You sure she&rsquo;ll be safe?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he replied, not looking at him. &ldquo;Once its released she&rsquo;s been injured and taken to the hospital, he&rsquo;ll be headed there while she&rsquo;ll be headed upstate.&rdquo; </p><p>He could feel the nervous energy radiating off him. He also figured he probably owed him an apology, but the thought left a bad taste in his mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;Are ya gonna tell her?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony rubbed the side of his face. He was tired, and he was afraid. And now he was about to ruin everything he&rsquo;d been working for to build an amicable relationship with you. &ldquo;No. You&rsquo;re right, she&rsquo;ll just get scared.&rdquo; Bucky nodded, but stayed silent, and Tony should have felt a little bad. &ldquo;You know what you have to do, don&rsquo;t you? What this means?&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky&rsquo;s eyes darted to his feet, but again he nodded. &ldquo;It means she&rsquo;s gonna hate me.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony instinctively reached out to give him a comforting pat, but pulled his hand back, scoffing internally. Instead, he offered, &nbsp;&ldquo;I wish there was another way.&rdquo; And to his surprise, it sounded almost sincere.</p><p>The doors opened on your floor, and Bucky followed Tony out. The two took a deep breath, waiting for the other&rsquo;s go ahead before knocking.</p><p>You flung the door open, and they pushed past you before you could feel any relief at seeing they weren&rsquo;t about to fight anymore. Tony grabbed an empty bag from your closet, and Bucky was pulling everything out of your backpack. </p><p>&ldquo;What was all that about earlier? Is everything alright? What are you doing?&rdquo; You watched in horror as they began to fill the bags with the contents of your closet and dresser. &ldquo;What the hell?!&rdquo;</p><p>Neither of them said anything, just carried on packing as much as they could in the bags. You ran to Tony and tried to grab your bag from him, but he turned to keep you from grabbing it as he ignored your demands to know what was happening.</p><p>&ldquo;Bucky,&rdquo; you pleaded, running over to him and yanking the backpack from his grasp. &ldquo;Bucky, please! Why are you doing this?!&rdquo; His silence stung, but his sudden inability to even look at you was what really hurt. &ldquo;Please, talk to me,&rdquo; you begged. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo; </p><p>He took hold of the bag, but you weren&rsquo;t going to let it go that easily. He tugged on it and turned, jolting you forward at an angle, and pushed you hard enough to send you stumbling against your bed. He zipped the bag and placed it by the door, grabbing another to fill, doing his best to ignore the betrayed look in your eyes. </p><p>When they&rsquo;d gathered enough of your things, Tony grabbed your arm to lead you out. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going away for a while,&rdquo; was all he supplied. &ldquo;And I need your phone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like hell! You can&rsquo;t take my phone!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I got it.&rdquo; As soon as he spoke the words, you felt Bucky snatch it from your pocket and placed it in his own.</p><p>You knew you weren&rsquo;t getting it back, no matter how hard you tried. Now you had no way to contact your mother. &ldquo;My mom,&rdquo; you swallowed back a lump. &ldquo;Does&hellip; did she plan this with you? Was this always meant to be the arrangement?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; Tony snapped, clearly offended at the insinuation. &ldquo;You just can&rsquo;t be here right now!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you bring me here if you were just going to send me away?! If you were going to pull this shit, you could have just left me at home! I was happy there!&rdquo; You yanked your arm from his grasp, turning to Bucky. &ldquo;And what about you?&rdquo; your voice cracked. &ldquo;I thought we were friends&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky didn&rsquo;t answer, and Tony ushered you into the elevator, the ride down to the garage quiet except for your occasional sniffle. You were taken to the car where Sam was waiting, and your bags were put in the trunk.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; Sam opened the door for you, &ldquo;get in the car.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I take it you&rsquo;re not going to tell me anything either?&rdquo; you snapped. &ldquo;Do you eve-&rdquo;</p><p>The sound of approaching sirens interrupted, and you turned to the others for an explanation when an ambulance drove into the garage. You began to grow concerned when Bucky shoved your backpack into your arms and pushed you into the car, blocking your view of the vehicle. </p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t long until the ambulance returned, speeding past your car as it left the building. Tony made a call as Bucky blocked the door, and Sam climbed into the seat beside you. Tony stayed on the phone for nearly half an hour, but you couldn&rsquo;t hear a word of it.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, Barnes, we need to go to the hospital!&rdquo; he called after hanging up. </p><p>Bucky took a last glance back at you, only vaguely making out your angry face behind the tinted window. You opened your backpack as the car started and made its way to the exit, hoping your earbuds were left inside. Though you didn&rsquo;t have anything to plug them into, you hoped they&rsquo;d be enough to let Sam know you were in no mood to speak to him. There was a picture frame at the top. Though the car was moving and you were already halfway outside, you swung the door open, causing the car to stop and Sam to reach out to grab you, but he was too late. </p><p>Tony&rsquo;s car screeched to a halt just behind yours, but it was Bucky who stepped out.</p><p>&ldquo;Get back in the car!&rdquo; he ordered.</p><p>His tone stopped you in your tracks. He&rsquo;d never shouted at you before, and it only made you angrier. Rather than hand him the frame back like you&rsquo;d intended, you threw it at his feet, shattering the glass.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an asshole! I never want to see you again!&rdquo; Without waiting for a response, you climbed back into the car, allowing it to take you wherever it was meant to.</p><p>Tony watched Bucky stare after your car as it drove away, only pulling the photo from the broken frame once it was out of sight. He got in the car and shoved it into the glove compartment before Tony could see it, and they headed toward the hospital.</p><p>&ldquo;Think anyone saw her?&rdquo; he asked, forcing his voice to be steady.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Tony assured him. &ldquo;Even if they did, the guy&rsquo;s probably already halfway to the hospital anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky hummed in understanding, hoping he was right. The rest of the trip was made in silence, the tension growing thicker with every minute that passed.</p><p>He dropped Bucky off at the front of the ER, where there was already press waiting. That was the plan; to be seen there so everyone and the crazy man would think that&rsquo;s where you were as you were taken elsewhere.</p><p>Tony parked the car, and didn&rsquo;t hesitate to open the glovebox to see what you&rsquo;d thrown at Bucky. He pulled out the photo and stared.</p><p>You were wearing one of his helmets. Not Bucky&rsquo;s tactical gear, or Sam&rsquo;s wings, or holding Steve&rsquo;s shield, but <i>his</i> helmet. You held a ridiculously heroic pose as Bucky lay on the floor, trying and failing to hide his amusement.</p><p>The jealousy he&rsquo;d come to expect didn&rsquo;t wash over him as it usually did. Instead, he was filled with a sadness over your having lost yet another person you trusted. He even felt a little guilty over making Bucky betray you like he did. He could have had anyone else go with him to gather your things, but the sick satisfaction he thought he&rsquo;d get over watching your bond sever was too much to resist.</p><p>Tony stuffed the picture back in the glove box, and started walking toward the entrance. With every step, his resolve grew; when this was over and you were safe, he&rsquo;d apologize to Bucky. Maybe he&rsquo;d even begin to try to make amends with him.</p><p>&ldquo;FRIDAY, tell the others to suit up and start searching the area.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On it!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, you bastard,&rdquo; he murmured as the reporters waved him over. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see you try to come for her now.&rdquo;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img

The door swung open, and your worry was replaced with anger when you saw the state of your bedroom. You had half a mind to go back and demand to know why Tony had gone through your things, but Bucky hadn&rsquo;t wanted you in the room. You had a sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach when you wondered if it had anything to do with what Sam had told you. </p>\n<p>Doing as asked, you shut the door behind you and locked it. You pulled your phone out and noticed several messages and missed calls from Peter. Ignoring them for the time being, you started scrolling through your contacts, pausing briefly when his name came up. You were tempted to call, and had it been anyone else confronting Bucky, you would have. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d just make excuses for Tony,&rdquo; you muttered, scrolling past. You found the name you wanted and pressed it, hoping he wasn&rsquo;t too busy to pick up.</p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;Hey, Y/N!&rdquo;</i> Steve greeted cheerfully.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Bucky&rsquo;s in trouble,&rdquo; you blurted, forgoing niceties. &ldquo;Tony&rsquo;s armed and <i>super</i> pissed at him.&rdquo;</p>\n</p>",
