In exact eight hours more, Y/N was supposed to be walking down the aisle to marry the man she loved. But instead of sleeping safe and sound in bed, she was running around her apartment, desperately searching for a green box which was supposed to be at the back of her closet where no one else would find.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t touched it in weeks! How could it just disappear?!\u201d Y/N exclaimed between shallow breaths. </p><p>Her maid of honor, Rosy, whom she was on the phone with, let out another heavy sigh. Rosy just assumed that her best friend was having a pre-wedding crisis, so calmly, she told the bride-to-be to just take a deep breath, go to bed, and save her energy for her big day.</p><p>\u201cDo as I say, Y/N, and I\u2019ll help you look for it tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that box is important to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes losing it in some ways affect your wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s not important, Y/N!\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t to Rosy, but to Y/N it was, and it made her feel guilty thinking that right now her box of letters was even more important than her wedding and future altogether. Those letters contained most of her youth, they were all the things nobody else knew except for herself. The last thing she would want was her friends, family, or her fianc\u00e9 to find out she\u2019d been writing letters throughout the years to this one boy named Harry Styles. What was worse, if Harry himself ever received those letters, she could not imagine the consequences.</p><!-- more --><p>The sudden door bell pulled Y/N back to reality, sending her rushing out of her bedroom.</p><p>\u201cWho would come to your house at this hour?!\u201d Rosy wondered as Y/N walked fast toward the front door.</p><p>\u201cIt must be my sister. I asked her to come help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gotta be kidding me!\u201d The maid of honor groaned into the phone, utterly hopeless for this entire phone call was like water off a duck\u2019s back. Y/N was clearly acting against everything Rosy\u2019d told her to do.</p><p>When Y/N turned the handle to open her door, she was expecting to see her little sister waiting outside. However, the hopeful smile was washed off of her face all at once, when instead of her sister, she saw the last person she would hope to see right now, the recipient of her secret letters.\u00a0</p><p>Y/N told Rosy she would phone her back, then went ahead and ended the call, ignoring her friend\u2019s confusion on the other line.\u00a0</p><p>Harry didn\u2019t say\u00a0a word. He was just gazing at her, as if to adjust to this unacquaintedness, at the same time, familiarity, when facing the girl he used to know so well, but not anymore.\u00a0And for that one brief second looking into his eyes, Y/N swore time was frozen and everything else faded away, he was the only thing she saw.\u00a0</p><p>Her mind went blank, and her whole body turned into a frozen statue when Harry gave her his notorious dimpled smile, the same fucking smile that\u2019d been haunting her ever since he left.</p><p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d he asked in the raspy voice she\u2019d\u00a0once very much adored.\u00a0</p><p>The memories from that night were coming back to Y/N now.\u00a0There he was, standing outside her door, same look on his face, same aching feeling in her heart. This time his hair was shorter whilst hers was longer, he\u2019d gotten a couple more tattoos whilst she&rsquo;d lost the innocence in her eyes. Neither was the same person as they were the night it all ended. But she knew despite all the twists and turns, it would always be the same ending.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot come in.\u201d Y/N\u00a0looked at Harry with tears in her eyes, and the sight of which left Harry in nothing but pain and guilt.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou have to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI drove all night here, Y/N,\u201d he asserted, then told her what he should have three years earlier.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not leaving.&ldquo;</p><p>Y/N furrowed her eyebrows at the uninvited guest, gripping tightly onto the wooden door as if it was giving her emotional strength.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cW-Why are you here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI found a box of letters from you on my doorsteps,\u201d he answered.</p><p>It was only then did Y/N notice the envelops Harry\u2019d been holding this whole time,\u00a0and she wished nothing more than to vanish from the face of Earth. With her face in the palms of her hands, Y/N tried to convince herself this wasn\u2019t real, despite already knowing it was. Her worst nightmare had come to life and there was nothing she could do about it.\u00a0</p><p>After having calmed down a little bit, the girl took a deep breath, let it out and stepped aside so Harry could enter her flat.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry, my\u2026my living room\u2019s kind of a mess.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Y/N closed the door behind them, carefully watching Harry as he looked around the room.\u00a0The floor was a battlefield with different objects scattering all over the place, and in the corner laid an opened suitcase, only half of which was filled. Y/N had been\u00a0packing for the honeymoon but was interrupted when she found out some of her valuables had gone missing.\u00a0</p><p>With a nonchalant smile, Harry watched his ex-girlfriend tripped on her own feet and almost knocked over a lamp on her way to the sofa. She was still her, the same clumsy girl he\u2019d fallen so madly in love with, and it was bittersweet to see her again as this new person he knew nothing about.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026I didn\u2019t\u2026expect guests.&rdquo;</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to judge your messy living room, petal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that,\u201d she said quickly, eyes staring at the floor.\u00a0</p><p>Harry was startled by the reaction, still, he apologized. Y/N wished she could just tell him how much she missed his nicknames for her, but he wasn\u2019t allowed to know that, because\u00a0this was a different scenario now.\u00a0She was getting married, and he wasn\u2019t the groom-to-be.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to sit or just go straight to the point?\u201d Y/N asked while nervously playing with the hem of her t-shirt.\u00a0</p><p>Looking down at her fidgeting hands, Harry finally noticed the shiny engagement ring on her finger, then an uncomfortable feeling immediately filled up his lungs, making him unable to breathe. He was never the kind of person to start a conversation with a question, but this time he had no choice.</p><p>\u201cDo you love him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not\u00a0relevant,\u201d Y/N commented with discomfort clear in her tone. However, with his inquiry, she finally knew that he\u2019d opened all five envelopes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dodging\u00a0my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine! Yes, I love him,\u201d Y/N answered without pause, staring at anything else but Harry.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m marrying him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than you loved me?\u201d</p><p>At this second question, Y/N lifted her head up and was eye-to-eye with Harry at last. She opened her mouth to answer, then closed it, then repeated the action, <i>twice</i>, still she couldn\u2019t give him the justification he wanted from her.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot make such comparison. Chris is Chris, you are you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes or no, Y/N, easy question.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t easy. It was a trick. If she said yes, then she would be a fool, if she said no, she would be a liar, and right now Y/N couldn\u2019t decide for herself\u00a0which one was worse. So she just stared at him, hoping he\u2019d just let this go.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you quiet? Clearly you had a lot of things to say.\u201d Harry breathed while holding up the five envelopes. He couldn\u2019t believe after three years, miscommunication was still their biggest unsolved problem.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to read those letters because it wasn\u2019t me who mailed them!\u201d</p><p>To Y/N\u2019s surprise, her ex-boyfriend was nothing but calm.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He nodded.\u00a0\u201cKat did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I traced back to the sender. She gave me your address.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did she do that?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the question is: Why did you include your wedding invitation in the fifth envelope, then address the box even though you didn\u2019t want me to ever receive your letters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI&hellip;I just&hellip;\u201d She started but never finished.\u00a0</p><p>For a long moment, they just stood in front of each other, holding the longest stare while trying to guess what\u2019s on the other person\u2019s mind. Sometimes the words you say hurt you more than weapons do, but sometimes the words you <i>cannot </i>say do you much more damage.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting married tomorrow,\u201d said Y/N, but it came out more like a reminder to herself than to the man standing in front of her.\u00a0\u201cWhatever I wrote in those letters, they don\u2019t matter anymore. I included the invitation because&hellip;because I was drunk one night&hellip;I wasn\u2019t thinking straight&hellip;And Kat must have found the box when she was searching through my closet. The last thing I wanted was for you to be <i>here.</i>..<i>now.</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou expect me to believe that, when you couldn\u2019t\u00a0even say you loved your fianc\u00e9 more than you loved me?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Harry!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Y/N took the weight off her feet and fell back on the sofa with her head in her hands, elbows on her knees. Harry took no time to rush to her side. He was literally on his knees in front of her.</p><p>\u201c<i>Baby</i>, look at me,\u201d he begged.\u00a0</p><p>And she did.\u00a0</p><p>She gathered all of her courage to look deep into his beautiful green eyes, and recalled countless number of times she\u2019d got lost in them, they used to be her safe haven. <i>He</i> used to be her home. Why did reality have to be so cruel?</p><p>\u201cI drove all night to be here before sunrise&hellip;\u201d Harry\u2019s voice broke as his heart did.\u00a0\u201cBecause if I had waited, it would\u2019ve been too late&hellip;\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cLate for what?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cFor me to stop you from marrying him,\u201d Harry replied with so much sincere in the sound of his voice.\u00a0</p><p>They\u2019d joked about this, that if he ever lost her and she ended up marrying someone else, he would show up at the wedding and win her back. But that was just a joke, <i>this</i>, however, was real.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cKat told me everything. You wanted me to stop you. That\u2019s why you include the invitation.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cKat didn\u2019t know what I wanted! Even\u00a0I don\u2019t know what I want,\u201d Y/N admitted out loud, so close too tears. \u201cBut&hellip;I\u2019m not doing this again, Harry. We\u2019ve put this life behind us, we need to keep on moving forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I tell you I can\u2019t?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Y/N squeezed her eyes shut and turned away. She didn\u2019t want to look at him nor had him see her cry. And she wished he would just shut up and leave her like he\u2019d done years ago.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N, everything I\u2019ve\u00a0done, everyone I\u2019ve been with in the past three years, could not help me forget about you&hellip;A-And&hellip;If I had to give up everything to change the past, I would. I just want it to be me and you against the world&hellip;This time I won\u2019t leave you alone.\u201d<br/></p><p>Y/N shook her head with her eyes close. She touched his face, cupping his cheeks with both of her hands. Harry stayed motionless as\u00a0he let the girl he loved run\u00a0her thumbs across his cheeks, she was just trying to remember every feature on his face. Because she knew, the only place that she could see him again after tonight, was in her dreams.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the same person anymore, and neither am I,\u201d she told him with a lump in her throat.\u00a0\u201cTold you I\u2019d always love you, didn\u2019t I? No matter&hellip;\u201d Her voice cracked and the tears started streaming down on her face.\u00a0\u201cNo matter whom I end up with&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, petal, don\u2019t say that.\u00a0Come with me, and we\u2019ll start over again. I-I already finished my tour, I could spend more time with you now. I would take care of you.\u201d Harry didn\u2019t even know what he was talking about anymore, words just constantly slipping out from his lips because he would say anything just to convince her to come back to him.\u00a0\u201cWe belong together&hellip;You know it. That should be me at the alter, not him.\u201d</p><p>He was holding both of her hands, which were still holding his face. It\u2019s the first time they\u2019d\u00a0cried together since the night he left. He truly didn\u2019t want to face the same ending twice.</p><p>\u201cI wanted that to be you.\u201d Y/N smiled, though she was crying, she put on a smile for him.\u00a0\u201cI wanted to marry you. I wanted us to have kids and to hear you say\u00a0\u2018Baby, I\u2019m home\u2019 every single night. But that\u2019s not how it would be if we\u2019d stayed together, I\u2019m never going to get that life. One day you\u2019re here, the next day you\u2019re not. We couldn\u2019t hold on back then, do you actually think it would be different this time?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIt would.\u201d He nodded his head fast.\u00a0\u201cOne year after our breakup, I came back to find you, I did. They said you sold our house and you moved away. I didn\u2019t know where to look for you.\u201d<br/></p><p>&ldquo;You came back for me?\u201d Her eyebrows puckered as the words leaving her mouth were full of breath.</p><p>\u201cI would always do,\u201d he said.<br/></p><p>They let silence took over again. And maybe that was the answer for Harry tonight. She still loved him, but she wouldn\u2019t come back. And even though it killed him to leave for the second time with nothing left inside but a beating heart, he wished her happiness, and a joyful life, and a wonderful wedding.</p><p>But when he got to the front door, her voice pulled him right back.</p><p>\u201cI have a question,\u201d she said.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he replied.<br/></p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d\u00a0found out about the wedding without receiving my letters, would you\u00a0still have come tonight?&rdquo;<br/></p><p>It didn\u2019t take him more than a second to give her his answer,\u00a0\u201cYes, Y/N, I would.\u201d</p><p>When the sound of Harry\u2019s footsteps faded away to silence in the empty hallway, on the floor, Y/N was already a broken mess.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cReady to go?\u201d<br/></p><p>Receiving just a nod as an answer, Harry\u2019s manager,\u00a0Jeff, told the driver to take them to the airport.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Harry\u2019s suddenly question got Jeff by surprise. The older man hurriedly\u00a0checked the watch on his left wrist before telling his friend it was 10 AM.</p><p><i>So it&rsquo;s now official</i>, Harry told himself. The girl he loved had officially become someone else\u2019s wife.\u00a0</p><p>He turned his face to the window, ignoring Jeff repeatedly asking him if he was alright. Normally he would fake a smile and said he couldn\u2019t be better, but he couldn\u2019t do it now when the pain was too much to bear.\u00a0</p><p>Harry got out of the car and got on his private jet at around 11 AM. His next stop was Italy. Jeff was reading the schedule for this entire day to Harry but all the young man could hear was a muffled sound in the background. And all he could think about was her, and the things she\u2019d\u00a0said, how she\u2019d\u00a0looked, how he\u2019d never see her again.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019d lived a life without her before, he certainly could do it again, he told himself that. But the last time he\u2019d left, he\u2019d been hoping for a better future for the two of them, this time, he had nowhere to place his faith. What was he going to do now that he knew they would never have another shot with each other?</p><p>\u201cHarry, your phone!\u201d Jeff\u2019s voice pulled Harry out from his pile of thoughts and he saw an unknown caller ID on the screen of his phone. He answered it anyway because of a strange feeling at the bottom of his chest. And Harry couldn\u2019t be more glad he\u2019d picked up that call.</p><p>\u201cHarry, it\u2019s Kat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKat, hey&hellip;Why\u2019d you call?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cY/N called off the wedding for good. She was on her way to you, everyone at home is freaking out at the moment.\u00a0I tried to call you but you had your phone turned off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, where are you going?!\u201d Jeff desperately called after his client, who tossed his phone somewhere on the floor and ran off the plane, without looking back for even half a second.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Fuck his schedule.\u00a0</p><p>Fuck Italy.\u00a0</p><p>He had to come back for her.\u00a0</p><p>&hellip;</p><p><br/></p><p>Y/N sat on Harry\u2019s doorstep, patiently waiting for him to come home. She\u2019d tried ringing the doorbell but nobody answered and she didn\u2019t have his number.\u00a0So all she could do now was wait here, with her make up and hair perfectly done, only missing the wedding dress.\u00a0</p><p>She wished she wasn\u2019t too late, but she\u2019d been waiting for almost an hour now. So Y/N told herself if he didn\u2019t come back in one hour more, she would accept her faith, return home, and face the music. It turned out, fortunately, she didn\u2019t have to, because\u00a0Harry showed up just in time.\u00a0</p><p>It was half past twelve when Harry stepped out of the yellow taxi and his heart stopped when he saw Y/N standing outside his door. Without saying a single word, they both ran towards each other, her arms wrapped around his neck and his around her waist.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cIt has to be you.\u201d<br/></p><p>Harry felt exactly the same, all of his broken pieces had fallen back together. He cupped her cheeks and kissed her hard on the mouth with everything he had to give. All of the feelings he\u2019d kept aside those three years were delivered in that one long, passionate, last first kiss.\u00a0</p><p>When they finally pulled apart, he laid kisses all over her face, her cheeks, her eyes, her forehead, her nose, to make up for the long period of time when he didn\u2019t even know where and how she\u2019d been, for the many times they\u2019d hurt and healed each other.</p><p>\u201cI love you, you know that right?\u201d he breathed while resting his forehead against Y/N\u2019s.\u00a0She bit her bottom lip to hold back a grin then nodded her head yes.<br/></p><p>\u201cI love you too, Harry. Always have, always will.\u201d<br/></p><p>His heart could burst with joy and it would be the last thing he cared about.</p><p>\u201cSo&hellip;\u201d Harry trailed off as he gently tucked her hair behind her ears to take a better look at her pretty face. And he was so wrong to think the butterflies in his stomach were all dead.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna write me letters again?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019ll write them back.\u201d She smiled, staring at his lips.<br/></p><p>\u201cOh, baby,\u201d he said before pulling her close for another kiss.\u00a0\u201cI will write you thousands.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p>",

What was worse, if Harry himself ever received those letters, she could not imagine the consequences.</p>[[MORE]]<p>The sudden door bell pulled Y/N back to reality, sending her rushing out of her bedroom.</p><p>\u201cWho would come to your house at this hour?!\u201d Rosy wondered as Y/N walked fast toward the front door.</p><p>\u201cIt must be my sister. I asked her to come help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gotta be kidding me!\u201d The maid of honor groaned into the phone, utterly hopeless for this entire phone call was like water off a duck\u2019s back. Y/N was clearly acting against everything Rosy\u2019d told her to do.</p><p>When Y/N turned the handle to open her door, she was expecting to see her little sister waiting outside. However, the hopeful smile was washed off of her face all at once, when instead of her sister, she saw the last person she would hope to see right now, the recipient of her secret letters.\u00a0</p><p>Y/N told Rosy she would phone her back, then went ahead and ended the call, ignoring her friend\u2019s confusion on the other line.\u00a0</p><p>Harry didn\u2019t say\u00a0a word. He was just gazing at her, as if to adjust to this unacquaintedness, at the same time, familiarity, when facing the girl he used to know so well, but not anymore.\u00a0And for that one brief second looking into his eyes, Y/N swore time was frozen and everything else faded away, he was the only thing she saw.\u00a0</p><p>Her mind went blank, and her whole body turned into a frozen statue when Harry gave her his notorious dimpled smile, the same fucking smile that\u2019d been haunting her ever since he left.</p><p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d he asked in the raspy voice she\u2019d\u00a0once very much adored.\u00a0</p><p>The memories from that night were coming back to Y/N now.\u00a0There he was, standing outside her door, same look on his face, same aching feeling in her heart. This time his hair was shorter whilst hers was longer, he\u2019d gotten a couple more tattoos whilst she\u2019d lost the innocence in her eyes. Neither was the same person as they were the night it all ended. But she knew despite all the twists and turns, it would always be the same ending.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot come in.\u201d Y/N\u00a0looked at Harry with tears in her eyes, and the sight of which left Harry in nothing but pain and guilt.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou have to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI drove all night here, Y/N,\u201d he asserted, then told her what he should have three years earlier.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not leaving.\u201c</p><p>Y/N furrowed her eyebrows at the uninvited guest, gripping tightly onto the wooden door as if it was giving her emotional strength.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cW-Why are you here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI found a box of letters from you on my doorsteps,\u201d he answered.</p><p>It was only then did Y/N notice the envelops Harry\u2019d been holding this whole time,\u00a0and she wished nothing more than to vanish from the face of Earth. With her face in the palms of her hands, Y/N tried to convince herself this wasn\u2019t real, despite already knowing it was. Her worst nightmare had come to life and there was nothing she could do about it.\u00a0</p><p>After having calmed down a little bit, the girl took a deep breath, let it out and stepped aside so Harry could enter her flat.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry, my\u2026my living room\u2019s kind of a mess.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Y/N closed the door behind them, carefully watching Harry as he looked around the room.\u00a0The floor was a battlefield with different objects scattering all over the place, and in the corner laid an opened suitcase, only half of which was filled. Y/N had been\u00a0packing for the honeymoon but was interrupted when she found out some of her valuables had gone missing.\u00a0</p><p>With a nonchalant smile, Harry watched his ex-girlfriend tripped on her own feet and almost knocked over a lamp on her way to the sofa. She was still her, the same clumsy girl he\u2019d fallen so madly in love with, and it was bittersweet to see her again as this new person he knew nothing about.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026I didn\u2019t\u2026expect guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to judge your messy living room, petal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that,\u201d she said quickly, eyes staring at the floor.\u00a0</p><p>Harry was startled by the reaction, still, he apologized. Y/N wished she could just tell him how much she missed his nicknames for her, but he wasn\u2019t allowed to know that, because\u00a0this was a different scenario now.\u00a0She was getting married, and he wasn\u2019t the groom-to-be.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to sit or just go straight to the point?\u201d Y/N asked while nervously playing with the hem of her t-shirt.\u00a0</p><p>Looking down at her fidgeting hands, Harry finally noticed the shiny engagement ring on her finger, then an uncomfortable feeling immediately filled up his lungs, making him unable to breathe. He was never the kind of person to start a conversation with a question, but this time he had no choice.</p><p>\u201cDo you love him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not\u00a0relevant,\u201d Y/N commented with discomfort clear in her tone. However, with his inquiry, she finally knew that he\u2019d opened all five envelopes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dodging\u00a0my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine! Yes, I love him,\u201d Y/N answered without pause, staring at anything else but Harry.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m marrying him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than you loved me?\u201d</p><p>At this second question, Y/N lifted her head up and was eye-to-eye with Harry at last. She opened her mouth to answer, then closed it, then repeated the action, <i>twice</i>, still she couldn\u2019t give him the justification he wanted from her.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot make such comparison. Chris is Chris, you are you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes or no, Y/N, easy question.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t easy. It was a trick. If she said yes, then she would be a fool, if she said no, she would be a liar, and right now Y/N couldn\u2019t decide for herself\u00a0which one was worse. So she just stared at him, hoping he\u2019d just let this go.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you quiet? Clearly you had a lot of things to say.\u201d Harry breathed while holding up the five envelopes. He couldn\u2019t believe after three years, miscommunication was still their biggest unsolved problem.<br></p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to read those letters because it wasn\u2019t me who mailed them!\u201d</p><p>To Y/N\u2019s surprise, her ex-boyfriend was nothing but calm.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He nodded.\u00a0\u201cKat did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I traced back to the sender. She gave me your address.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did she do that?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the question is: Why did you include your wedding invitation in the fifth envelope, then address the box even though you didn\u2019t want me to ever receive your letters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026I just\u2026\u201d She started but never finished.\u00a0</p><p>For a long moment, they just stood in front of each other, holding the longest stare while trying to guess what\u2019s on the other person\u2019s mind. Sometimes the words you say hurt you more than weapons do, but sometimes the words you <i>cannot </i>say do you much more damage.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting married tomorrow,\u201d said Y/N, but it came out more like a reminder to herself than to the man standing in front of her.\u00a0\u201cWhatever I wrote in those letters, they don\u2019t matter anymore. I included the invitation because\u2026because I was drunk one night\u2026I wasn\u2019t thinking straight\u2026And Kat must have found the box when she was searching through my closet. The last thing I wanted was for you to be <i>here.</i>..<i>now.</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou expect me to believe that, when you couldn\u2019t\u00a0even say you loved your fianc\u00e9 more than you loved me?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Harry!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Y/N took the weight off her feet and fell back on the sofa with her head in her hands, elbows on her knees. Harry took no time to rush to her side. He was literally on his knees in front of her.</p><p>\u201c<i>Baby</i>, look at me,\u201d he begged.\u00a0</p><p>And she did.\u00a0</p><p>She gathered all of her courage to look deep into his beautiful green eyes, and recalled countless number of times she\u2019d got lost in them, they used to be her safe haven. <i>He</i> used to be her home. Why did reality have to be so cruel?</p><p>\u201cI drove all night to be here before sunrise\u2026\u201d Harry\u2019s voice broke as his heart did.\u00a0\u201cBecause if I had waited, it would\u2019ve been too late\u2026\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cLate for what?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cFor me to stop you from marrying him,\u201d Harry replied with so much sincere in the sound of his voice.\u00a0</p><p>They\u2019d joked about this, that if he ever lost her and she ended up marrying someone else, he would show up at the wedding and win her back. But that was just a joke, <i>this</i>, however, was real.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cKat told me everything. You wanted me to stop you. That\u2019s why you include the invitation.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cKat didn\u2019t know what I wanted! Even\u00a0I don\u2019t know what I want,\u201d Y/N admitted out loud, so close too tears. \u201cBut\u2026I\u2019m not doing this again, Harry. We\u2019ve put this life behind us, we need to keep on moving forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I tell you I can\u2019t?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Y/N squeezed her eyes shut and turned away. She didn\u2019t want to look at him nor had him see her cry. And she wished he would just shut up and leave her like he\u2019d done years ago.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N, everything I\u2019ve\u00a0done, everyone I\u2019ve been with in the past three years, could not help me forget about you\u2026A-And\u2026If I had to give up everything to change the past, I would. I just want it to be me and you against the world\u2026This time I won\u2019t leave you alone.\u201d<br></p><p>Y/N shook her head with her eyes close. She touched his face, cupping his cheeks with both of her hands. Harry stayed motionless as\u00a0he let the girl he loved run\u00a0her thumbs across his cheeks, she was just trying to remember every feature on his face. Because she knew, the only place that she could see him again after tonight, was in her dreams.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the same person anymore, and neither am I,\u201d she told him with a lump in her throat.\u00a0\u201cTold you I\u2019d always love you, didn\u2019t I? No matter\u2026\u201d Her voice cracked and the tears started streaming down on her face.\u00a0\u201cNo matter whom I end up with\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, petal, don\u2019t say that.\u00a0Come with me, and we\u2019ll start over again. I-I already finished my tour, I could spend more time with you now. I would take care of you.\u201d Harry didn\u2019t even know what he was talking about anymore, words just constantly slipping out from his lips because he would say anything just to convince her to come back to him.\u00a0\u201cWe belong together\u2026You know it. That should be me at the alter, not him.\u201d</p><p>He was holding both of her hands, which were still holding his face. It\u2019s the first time they\u2019d\u00a0cried together since the night he left. He truly didn\u2019t want to face the same ending twice.</p><p>\u201cI wanted that to be you.\u201d Y/N smiled, though she was crying, she put on a smile for him.\u00a0\u201cI wanted to marry you. I wanted us to have kids and to hear you say\u00a0\u2018Baby, I\u2019m home\u2019 every single night. But that\u2019s not how it would be if we\u2019d stayed together, I\u2019m never going to get that life. One day you\u2019re here, the next day you\u2019re not. We couldn\u2019t hold on back then, do you actually think it would be different this time?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt would.\u201d He nodded his head fast.\u00a0\u201cOne year after our breakup, I came back to find you, I did. They said you sold our house and you moved away. I didn\u2019t know where to look for you.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou came back for me?\u201d Her eyebrows puckered as the words leaving her mouth were full of breath.</p><p>\u201cI would always do,\u201d he said.<br></p><p>They let silence took over again. And maybe that was the answer for Harry tonight. She still loved him, but she wouldn\u2019t come back. And even though it killed him to leave for the second time with nothing left inside but a beating heart, he wished her happiness, and a joyful life, and a wonderful wedding.</p><p>But when he got to the front door, her voice pulled him right back.</p><p>\u201cI have a question,\u201d she said.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he replied.<br></p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d\u00a0found out about the wedding without receiving my letters, would you\u00a0still have come tonight?\u201d<br></p><p>It didn\u2019t take him more than a second to give her his answer,\u00a0\u201cYes, Y/N, I would.\u201d</p><p>When the sound of Harry\u2019s footsteps faded away to silence in the empty hallway, on the floor, Y/N was already a broken mess.</p><p>\u2026</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cReady to go?\u201d<br></p><p>Receiving just a nod as an answer, Harry\u2019s manager,\u00a0Jeff, told the driver to take them to the airport.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Harry\u2019s suddenly question got Jeff by surprise. The older man hurriedly\u00a0checked the watch on his left wrist before telling his friend it was 10 AM.</p><p><i>So it\u2019s now official</i>, Harry told himself. The girl he loved had officially become someone else\u2019s wife.\u00a0</p><p>He turned his face to the window, ignoring Jeff repeatedly asking him if he was alright. Normally he would fake a smile and said he couldn\u2019t be better, but he couldn\u2019t do it now when the pain was too much to bear.\u00a0</p><p>Harry got out of the car and got on his private jet at around 11 AM. His next stop was Italy. Jeff was reading the schedule for this entire day to Harry but all the young man could hear was a muffled sound in the background. And all he could think about was her, and the things she\u2019d\u00a0said, how she\u2019d\u00a0looked, how he\u2019d never see her again.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019d lived a life without her before, he certainly could do it again, he told himself that. But the last time he\u2019d left, he\u2019d been hoping for a better future for the two of them, this time, he had nowhere to place his faith. What was he going to do now that he knew they would never have another shot with each other?</p><p>\u201cHarry, your phone!\u201d Jeff\u2019s voice pulled Harry out from his pile of thoughts and he saw an unknown caller ID on the screen of his phone. He answered it anyway because of a strange feeling at the bottom of his chest. And Harry couldn\u2019t be more glad he\u2019d picked up that call.</p><p>\u201cHarry, it\u2019s Kat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKat, hey\u2026Why\u2019d you call?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cY/N called off the wedding for good. She was on her way to you, everyone at home is freaking out at the moment.\u00a0I tried to call you but you had your phone turned off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, where are you going?!\u201d Jeff desperately called after his client, who tossed his phone somewhere on the floor and ran off the plane, without looking back for even half a second.\u00a0<br></p><p>Fuck his schedule.\u00a0</p><p>Fuck Italy.\u00a0</p><p>He had to come back for her.\u00a0</p><p>\u2026</p><p><br></p><p>Y/N sat on Harry\u2019s doorstep, patiently waiting for him to come home. She\u2019d tried ringing the doorbell but nobody answered and she didn\u2019t have his number.\u00a0So all she could do now was wait here, with her make up and hair perfectly done, only missing the wedding dress.\u00a0</p><p>She wished she wasn\u2019t too late, but she\u2019d been waiting for almost an hour now. So Y/N told herself if he didn\u2019t come back in one hour more, she would accept her faith, return home, and face the music. It turned out, fortunately, she didn\u2019t have to, because\u00a0Harry showed up just in time.\u00a0</p><p>It was half past twelve when Harry stepped out of the yellow taxi and his heart stopped when he saw Y/N standing outside his door. Without saying a single word, they both ran towards each other, her arms wrapped around his neck and his around her waist.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cIt has to be you.\u201d<br></p><p>Harry felt exactly the same, all of his broken pieces had fallen back together. He cupped her cheeks and kissed her hard on the mouth with everything he had to give. All of the feelings he\u2019d kept aside those three years were delivered in that one long, passionate, last first kiss.\u00a0</p><p>When they finally pulled apart, he laid kisses all over her face, her cheeks, her eyes, her forehead, her nose, to make up for the long period of time when he didn\u2019t even know where and how she\u2019d been, for the many times they\u2019d hurt and healed each other.</p><p>\u201cI love you, you know that right?\u201d he breathed while resting his forehead against Y/N\u2019s.\u00a0She bit her bottom lip to hold back a grin then nodded her head yes.<br></p><p>\u201cI love you too, Harry. Always have, always will.\u201d<br></p><p>His heart could burst with joy and it would be the last thing he cared about.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Harry trailed off as he gently tucked her hair behind her ears to take a better look at her pretty face. And he was so wrong to think the butterflies in his stomach were all dead.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna write me letters again?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019ll write them back.\u201d She smiled, staring at his lips.<br></p><p>\u201cOh, baby,\u201d he said before pulling her close for another kiss.\u00a0\u201cI will write you thousands.\u201d\u00a0<br></p></p>",

In exact eight hours more, Y/N was supposed to be walking down the aisle to marry the man she loved. But instead of sleeping safe and sound in bed, she was running around her apartment, desperately searching for a green box which was supposed to be at the back of her closet where no one else would find.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t touched it in weeks! How could it just disappear?!\u201d Y/N exclaimed between shallow breaths. </p><p>Her maid of honor, Rosy, whom she was on the phone with, let out another heavy sigh. Rosy just assumed that her best friend was having a pre-wedding crisis, so calmly, she told the bride-to-be to just take a deep breath, go to bed, and save her energy for her big day.</p><p>\u201cDo as I say, Y/N, and I\u2019ll help you look for it tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that box is important to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes losing it in some ways affect your wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s not important, Y/N!\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t to Rosy, but to Y/N it was, and it made her feel guilty thinking that right now her box of letters was even more important than her wedding and future altogether. Those letters contained most of her youth, they were all the things nobody else knew except for herself. The last thing she would want was her friends, family, or her fianc\u00e9 to find out she\u2019d been writing letters throughout the years to this one boy named Harry Styles. What was worse, if Harry himself ever received those letters, she could not imagine the consequences.</p>[[MORE]]<p>The sudden door bell pulled Y/N back to reality, sending her rushing out of her bedroom.</p><p>\u201cWho would come to your house at this hour?!\u201d Rosy wondered as Y/N walked fast toward the front door.</p><p>\u201cIt must be my sister. I asked her to come help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gotta be kidding me!\u201d The maid of honor groaned into the phone, utterly hopeless for this entire phone call was like water off a duck\u2019s back. Y/N was clearly acting against everything Rosy\u2019d told her to do.</p><p>When Y/N turned the handle to open her door, she was expecting to see her little sister waiting outside. However, the hopeful smile was washed off of her face all at once, when instead of her sister, she saw the last person she would hope to see right now, the recipient of her secret letters.\u00a0</p><p>Y/N told Rosy she would phone her back, then went ahead and ended the call, ignoring her friend\u2019s confusion on the other line.\u00a0</p><p>Harry didn\u2019t say\u00a0a word. He was just gazing at her, as if to adjust to this unacquaintedness, at the same time, familiarity, when facing the girl he used to know so well, but not anymore.\u00a0And for that one brief second looking into his eyes, Y/N swore time was frozen and everything else faded away, he was the only thing she saw.\u00a0</p><p>Her mind went blank, and her whole body turned into a frozen statue when Harry gave her his notorious dimpled smile, the same fucking smile that\u2019d been haunting her ever since he left.</p><p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d he asked in the raspy voice she\u2019d\u00a0once very much adored.\u00a0</p><p>The memories from that night were coming back to Y/N now.\u00a0There he was, standing outside her door, same look on his face, same aching feeling in her heart. This time his hair was shorter whilst hers was longer, he\u2019d gotten a couple more tattoos whilst she\u2019d lost the innocence in her eyes. Neither was the same person as they were the night it all ended. But she knew despite all the twists and turns, it would always be the same ending.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot come in.\u201d Y/N\u00a0looked at Harry with tears in her eyes, and the sight of which left Harry in nothing but pain and guilt.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou have to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI drove all night here, Y/N,\u201d he asserted, then told her what he should have three years earlier.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not leaving.\u201c</p><p>Y/N furrowed her eyebrows at the uninvited guest, gripping tightly onto the wooden door as if it was giving her emotional strength.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cW-Why are you here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI found a box of letters from you on my doorsteps,\u201d he answered.</p><p>It was only then did Y/N notice the envelops Harry\u2019d been holding this whole time,\u00a0and she wished nothing more than to vanish from the face of Earth. With her face in the palms of her hands, Y/N tried to convince herself this wasn\u2019t real, despite already knowing it was. Her worst nightmare had come to life and there was nothing she could do about it.\u00a0</p><p>After having calmed down a little bit, the girl took a deep breath, let it out and stepped aside so Harry could enter her flat.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry, my\u2026my living room\u2019s kind of a mess.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Y/N closed the door behind them, carefully watching Harry as he looked around the room.\u00a0The floor was a battlefield with different objects scattering all over the place, and in the corner laid an opened suitcase, only half of which was filled. Y/N had been\u00a0packing for the honeymoon but was interrupted when she found out some of her valuables had gone missing.\u00a0</p><p>With a nonchalant smile, Harry watched his ex-girlfriend tripped on her own feet and almost knocked over a lamp on her way to the sofa. She was still her, the same clumsy girl he\u2019d fallen so madly in love with, and it was bittersweet to see her again as this new person he knew nothing about.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026I didn\u2019t\u2026expect guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to judge your messy living room, petal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that,\u201d she said quickly, eyes staring at the floor.\u00a0</p><p>Harry was startled by the reaction, still, he apologized. Y/N wished she could just tell him how much she missed his nicknames for her, but he wasn\u2019t allowed to know that, because\u00a0this was a different scenario now.\u00a0She was getting married, and he wasn\u2019t the groom-to-be.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to sit or just go straight to the point?\u201d Y/N asked while nervously playing with the hem of her t-shirt.\u00a0</p><p>Looking down at her fidgeting hands, Harry finally noticed the shiny engagement ring on her finger, then an uncomfortable feeling immediately filled up his lungs, making him unable to breathe. He was never the kind of person to start a conversation with a question, but this time he had no choice.</p><p>\u201cDo you love him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not\u00a0relevant,\u201d Y/N commented with discomfort clear in her tone. However, with his inquiry, she finally knew that he\u2019d opened all five envelopes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dodging\u00a0my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine! Yes, I love him,\u201d Y/N answered without pause, staring at anything else but Harry.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m marrying him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than you loved me?\u201d</p><p>At this second question, Y/N lifted her head up and was eye-to-eye with Harry at last. She opened her mouth to answer, then closed it, then repeated the action, <i>twice</i>, still she couldn\u2019t give him the justification he wanted from her.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot make such comparison. Chris is Chris, you are you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes or no, Y/N, easy question.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t easy. It was a trick. If she said yes, then she would be a fool, if she said no, she would be a liar, and right now Y/N couldn\u2019t decide for herself\u00a0which one was worse. So she just stared at him, hoping he\u2019d just let this go.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you quiet? Clearly you had a lot of things to say.\u201d Harry breathed while holding up the five envelopes. He couldn\u2019t believe after three years, miscommunication was still their biggest unsolved problem.<br></p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to read those letters because it wasn\u2019t me who mailed them!\u201d</p><p>To Y/N\u2019s surprise, her ex-boyfriend was nothing but calm.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He nodded.\u00a0\u201cKat did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I traced back to the sender. She gave me your address.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did she do that?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the question is: Why did you include your wedding invitation in the fifth envelope, then address the box even though you didn\u2019t want me to ever receive your letters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026I just\u2026\u201d She started but never finished.\u00a0</p><p>For a long moment, they just stood in front of each other, holding the longest stare while trying to guess what\u2019s on the other person\u2019s mind. Sometimes the words you say hurt you more than weapons do, but sometimes the words you <i>cannot </i>say do you much more damage.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting married tomorrow,\u201d said Y/N, but it came out more like a reminder to herself than to the man standing in front of her.\u00a0\u201cWhatever I wrote in those letters, they don\u2019t matter anymore. I included the invitation because\u2026because I was drunk one night\u2026I wasn\u2019t thinking straight\u2026And Kat must have found the box when she was searching through my closet. The last thing I wanted was for you to be <i>here.</i>..<i>now.</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou expect me to believe that, when you couldn\u2019t\u00a0even say you loved your fianc\u00e9 more than you loved me?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Harry!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Y/N took the weight off her feet and fell back on the sofa with her head in her hands, elbows on her knees. Harry took no time to rush to her side. He was literally on his knees in front of her.</p><p>\u201c<i>Baby</i>, look at me,\u201d he begged.\u00a0</p><p>And she did.\u00a0</p><p>She gathered all of her courage to look deep into his beautiful green eyes, and recalled countless number of times she\u2019d got lost in them, they used to be her safe haven. <i>He</i> used to be her home. Why did reality have to be so cruel?</p><p>\u201cI drove all night to be here before sunrise\u2026\u201d Harry\u2019s voice broke as his heart did.\u00a0\u201cBecause if I had waited, it would\u2019ve been too late\u2026\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cLate for what?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cFor me to stop you from marrying him,\u201d Harry replied with so much sincere in the sound of his voice.\u00a0</p><p>They\u2019d joked about this, that if he ever lost her and she ended up marrying someone else, he would show up at the wedding and win her back. But that was just a joke, <i>this</i>, however, was real.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cKat told me everything. You wanted me to stop you. That\u2019s why you include the invitation.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cKat didn\u2019t know what I wanted! Even\u00a0I don\u2019t know what I want,\u201d Y/N admitted out loud, so close too tears. \u201cBut\u2026I\u2019m not doing this again, Harry. We\u2019ve put this life behind us, we need to keep on moving forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I tell you I can\u2019t?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Y/N squeezed her eyes shut and turned away. She didn\u2019t want to look at him nor had him see her cry. And she wished he would just shut up and leave her like he\u2019d done years ago.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N, everything I\u2019ve\u00a0done, everyone I\u2019ve been with in the past three years, could not help me forget about you\u2026A-And\u2026If I had to give up everything to change the past, I would. I just want it to be me and you against the world\u2026This time I won\u2019t leave you alone.\u201d<br></p><p>Y/N shook her head with her eyes close. She touched his face, cupping his cheeks with both of her hands. Harry stayed motionless as\u00a0he let the girl he loved run\u00a0her thumbs across his cheeks, she was just trying to remember every feature on his face. Because she knew, the only place that she could see him again after tonight, was in her dreams.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the same person anymore, and neither am I,\u201d she told him with a lump in her throat.\u00a0\u201cTold you I\u2019d always love you, didn\u2019t I? No matter\u2026\u201d Her voice cracked and the tears started streaming down on her face.\u00a0\u201cNo matter whom I end up with\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, petal, don\u2019t say that.\u00a0Come with me, and we\u2019ll start over again. I-I already finished my tour, I could spend more time with you now. I would take care of you.\u201d Harry didn\u2019t even know what he was talking about anymore, words just constantly slipping out from his lips because he would say anything just to convince her to come back to him.\u00a0\u201cWe belong together\u2026You know it. That should be me at the alter, not him.\u201d</p><p>He was holding both of her hands, which were still holding his face. It\u2019s the first time they\u2019d\u00a0cried together since the night he left. He truly didn\u2019t want to face the same ending twice.</p><p>\u201cI wanted that to be you.\u201d Y/N smiled, though she was crying, she put on a smile for him.\u00a0\u201cI wanted to marry you. I wanted us to have kids and to hear you say\u00a0\u2018Baby, I\u2019m home\u2019 every single night. But that\u2019s not how it would be if we\u2019d stayed together, I\u2019m never going to get that life. One day you\u2019re here, the next day you\u2019re not. We couldn\u2019t hold on back then, do you actually think it would be different this time?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt would.\u201d He nodded his head fast.\u00a0\u201cOne year after our breakup, I came back to find you, I did. They said you sold our house and you moved away. I didn\u2019t know where to look for you.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou came back for me?\u201d Her eyebrows puckered as the words leaving her mouth were full of breath.</p><p>\u201cI would always do,\u201d he said.<br></p><p>They let silence took over again. And maybe that was the answer for Harry tonight. She still loved him, but she wouldn\u2019t come back. And even though it killed him to leave for the second time with nothing left inside but a beating heart, he wished her happiness, and a joyful life, and a wonderful wedding.</p><p>But when he got to the front door, her voice pulled him right back.</p><p>\u201cI have a question,\u201d she said.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he replied.<br></p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d\u00a0found out about the wedding without receiving my letters, would you\u00a0still have come tonight?\u201d<br></p><p>It didn\u2019t take him more than a second to give her his answer,\u00a0\u201cYes, Y/N, I would.\u201d</p><p>When the sound of Harry\u2019s footsteps faded away to silence in the empty hallway, on the floor, Y/N was already a broken mess.</p><p>\u2026</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cReady to go?\u201d<br></p><p>Receiving just a nod as an answer, Harry\u2019s manager,\u00a0Jeff, told the driver to take them to the airport.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Harry\u2019s suddenly question got Jeff by surprise. The older man hurriedly\u00a0checked the watch on his left wrist before telling his friend it was 10 AM.</p><p><i>So it\u2019s now official</i>, Harry told himself. The girl he loved had officially become someone else\u2019s wife.\u00a0</p><p>He turned his face to the window, ignoring Jeff repeatedly asking him if he was alright. Normally he would fake a smile and said he couldn\u2019t be better, but he couldn\u2019t do it now when the pain was too much to bear.\u00a0</p><p>Harry got out of the car and got on his private jet at around 11 AM. His next stop was Italy. Jeff was reading the schedule for this entire day to Harry but all the young man could hear was a muffled sound in the background. And all he could think about was her, and the things she\u2019d\u00a0said, how she\u2019d\u00a0looked, how he\u2019d never see her again.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019d lived a life without her before, he certainly could do it again, he told himself that. But the last time he\u2019d left, he\u2019d been hoping for a better future for the two of them, this time, he had nowhere to place his faith. What was he going to do now that he knew they would never have another shot with each other?</p><p>\u201cHarry, your phone!\u201d Jeff\u2019s voice pulled Harry out from his pile of thoughts and he saw an unknown caller ID on the screen of his phone. He answered it anyway because of a strange feeling at the bottom of his chest. And Harry couldn\u2019t be more glad he\u2019d picked up that call.</p><p>\u201cHarry, it\u2019s Kat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKat, hey\u2026Why\u2019d you call?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cY/N called off the wedding for good. She was on her way to you, everyone at home is freaking out at the moment.\u00a0I tried to call you but you had your phone turned off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, where are you going?!\u201d Jeff desperately called after his client, who tossed his phone somewhere on the floor and ran off the plane, without looking back for even half a second.\u00a0<br></p><p>Fuck his schedule.\u00a0</p><p>Fuck Italy.\u00a0</p><p>He had to come back for her.\u00a0</p><p>\u2026</p><p><br></p><p>Y/N sat on Harry\u2019s doorstep, patiently waiting for him to come home. She\u2019d tried ringing the doorbell but nobody answered and she didn\u2019t have his number.\u00a0So all she could do now was wait here, with her make up and hair perfectly done, only missing the wedding dress.\u00a0</p><p>She wished she wasn\u2019t too late, but she\u2019d been waiting for almost an hour now. So Y/N told herself if he didn\u2019t come back in one hour more, she would accept her faith, return home, and face the music. It turned out, fortunately, she didn\u2019t have to, because\u00a0Harry showed up just in time.\u00a0</p><p>It was half past twelve when Harry stepped out of the yellow taxi and his heart stopped when he saw Y/N standing outside his door. Without saying a single word, they both ran towards each other, her arms wrapped around his neck and his around her waist.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cIt has to be you.\u201d<br></p><p>Harry felt exactly the same, all of his broken pieces had fallen back together. He cupped her cheeks and kissed her hard on the mouth with everything he had to give. All of the feelings he\u2019d kept aside those three years were delivered in that one long, passionate, last first kiss.\u00a0</p><p>When they finally pulled apart, he laid kisses all over her face, her cheeks, her eyes, her forehead, her nose, to make up for the long period of time when he didn\u2019t even know where and how she\u2019d been, for the many times they\u2019d hurt and healed each other.</p><p>\u201cI love you, you know that right?\u201d he breathed while resting his forehead against Y/N\u2019s.\u00a0She bit her bottom lip to hold back a grin then nodded her head yes.<br></p><p>\u201cI love you too, Harry. Always have, always will.\u201d<br></p><p>His heart could burst with joy and it would be the last thing he cared about.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Harry trailed off as he gently tucked her hair behind her ears to take a better look at her pretty face. And he was so wrong to think the butterflies in his stomach were all dead.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna write me letters again?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019ll write them back.\u201d She smiled, staring at his lips.<br></p><p>\u201cOh, baby,\u201d he said before pulling her close for another kiss.\u00a0\u201cI will write you thousands.\u201d\u00a0<br></p></p>",

In exact eight hours more, Y/N was supposed to be walking down the aisle to marry the man she loved. But instead of sleeping safe and sound in bed, she was running around her apartment, desperately searching for a green box which was supposed to be at the back of her closet where no one else would find.</p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t touched it in weeks! How could it just disappear?!&rdquo; Y/N exclaimed between shallow breaths. </p><p>Her maid of honor, Rosy, whom she was on the phone with, let out another heavy sigh. Rosy just assumed that her best friend was having a pre-wedding crisis, so calmly, she told the bride-to-be to just take a deep breath, go to bed, and save her energy for her big day.</p><p>&ldquo;Do as I say, Y/N, and I&rsquo;ll help you look for it tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, that box is important to me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Does losing it in some ways affect your wedding?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s not important, Y/N!&rdquo;</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t to Rosy, but to Y/N it was, and it made her feel guilty thinking that right now her box of letters was even more important than her wedding and future altogether. Those letters contained most of her youth, they were all the things nobody else knew except for herself. The last thing she would want was her friends, family, or her fianc&eacute; to find out she&rsquo;d been writing letters throughout the years to this one boy named Harry Styles. What was worse, if Harry himself ever received those letters, she could not imagine the consequences.</p><p>The sudden door bell pulled Y/N back to reality, sending her rushing out of her bedroom.</p><p>&ldquo;Who would come to your house at this hour?!&rdquo; Rosy wondered as Y/N walked fast toward the front door.</p><p>&ldquo;It must be my sister. I asked her to come help.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve gotta be kidding me!&rdquo; The maid of honor groaned into the phone, utterly hopeless for this entire phone call was like water off a duck&rsquo;s back. Y/N was clearly acting against everything Rosy&rsquo;d told her to do.</p><p>When Y/N turned the handle to open her door, she was expecting to see her little sister waiting outside. However, the hopeful smile was washed off of her face all at once, when instead of her sister, she saw the last person she would hope to see right now, the recipient of her secret letters.&nbsp;</p><p>Y/N told Rosy she would phone her back, then went ahead and ended the call, ignoring her friend&rsquo;s confusion on the other line.&nbsp;</p><p>Harry didn&rsquo;t say&nbsp;a word.

Neither was the same person as they were the night it all ended. But she knew despite all the twists and turns, it would always be the same ending.</p><p>&ldquo;You cannot come in.&rdquo; Y/N&nbsp;looked at Harry with tears in her eyes, and the sight of which left Harry in nothing but pain and guilt.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You have to leave.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I drove all night here, Y/N,&rdquo; he asserted, then told her what he should have three years earlier.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not leaving.&ldquo;</p><p>Y/N furrowed her eyebrows at the uninvited guest, gripping tightly onto the wooden door as if it was giving her emotional strength.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;W-Why are you here?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I found a box of letters from you on my doorsteps,&rdquo; he answered.</p><p>It was only then did Y/N notice the envelops Harry&rsquo;d been holding this whole time,&nbsp;and she wished nothing more than to vanish from the face of Earth.

Y/N wished she could just tell him how much she missed his nicknames for her, but he wasn&rsquo;t allowed to know that, because&nbsp;this was a different scenario now.&nbsp;She was getting married, and he wasn&rsquo;t the groom-to-be.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to sit or just go straight to the point?&rdquo; Y/N asked while nervously playing with the hem of her t-shirt.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking down at her fidgeting hands, Harry finally noticed the shiny engagement ring on her finger, then an uncomfortable feeling immediately filled up his lungs, making him unable to breathe. He was never the kind of person to start a conversation with a question, but this time he had no choice.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you love him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not&nbsp;relevant,&rdquo; Y/N commented with discomfort clear in her tone. However, with his inquiry, she finally knew that he&rsquo;d opened all five envelopes.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re dodging&nbsp;my question.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine! Yes, I love him,&rdquo; Y/N answered without pause, staring at anything else but Harry.&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m marrying him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;More than you loved me?&rdquo;</p><p>At this second question, Y/N lifted her head up and was eye-to-eye with Harry at last. She opened her mouth to answer, then closed it, then repeated the action, <i>twice</i>, still she couldn&rsquo;t give him the justification he wanted from her.</p><p>&ldquo;You cannot make such comparison. Chris is Chris, you are you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes or no, Y/N, easy question.&rdquo;</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t easy. It was a trick. If she said yes, then she would be a fool, if she said no, she would be a liar, and right now Y/N couldn&rsquo;t decide for herself&nbsp;which one was worse. So she just stared at him, hoping he&rsquo;d just let this go.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you quiet? Clearly you had a lot of things to say.&rdquo; Harry breathed while holding up the five envelopes. He couldn&rsquo;t believe after three years, miscommunication was still their biggest unsolved problem.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t supposed to read those letters because it wasn&rsquo;t me who mailed them!&rdquo;</p><p>To Y/N&rsquo;s surprise, her ex-boyfriend was nothing but calm.</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; He nodded.&nbsp;&ldquo;Kat did.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My sister?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I traced back to the sender. She gave me your address.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why did she do that?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, the question is: Why did you include your wedding invitation in the fifth envelope, then address the box even though you didn&rsquo;t want me to ever receive your letters?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;I just&hellip;&rdquo; She started but never finished.&nbsp;</p><p>For a long moment, they just stood in front of each other, holding the longest stare while trying to guess what&rsquo;s on the other person&rsquo;s mind. Sometimes the words you say hurt you more than weapons do, but sometimes the words you <i>cannot </i>say do you much more damage.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting married tomorrow,&rdquo; said Y/N, but it came out more like a reminder to herself than to the man standing in front of her.&nbsp;&ldquo;Whatever I wrote in those letters, they don&rsquo;t matter anymore. I included the invitation because&hellip;because I was drunk one night&hellip;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking straight&hellip;And Kat must have found the box when she was searching through my closet. The last thing I wanted was for you to be <i>here.</i>..<i>now.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You expect me to believe that, when you couldn&rsquo;t&nbsp;even say you loved your fianc&eacute; more than you loved me?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Harry!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Y/N took the weight off her feet and fell back on the sofa with her head in her hands, elbows on her knees. Harry took no time to rush to her side. He was literally on his knees in front of her.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Baby</i>, look at me,&rdquo; he begged.&nbsp;</p><p>And she did.&nbsp;</p><p>She gathered all of her courage to look deep into his beautiful green eyes, and recalled countless number of times she&rsquo;d got lost in them, they used to be her safe haven. <i>He</i> used to be her home. Why did reality have to be so cruel?</p><p>&ldquo;I drove all night to be here before sunrise&hellip;&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s voice broke as his heart did.&nbsp;&ldquo;Because if I had waited, it would&rsquo;ve been too late&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Late for what?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;For me to stop you from marrying him,&rdquo; Harry replied with so much sincere in the sound of his voice.&nbsp;</p><p>They&rsquo;d joked about this, that if he ever lost her and she ended up marrying someone else, he would show up at the wedding and win her back. But that was just a joke, <i>this</i>, however, was real.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Kat told me everything. You wanted me to stop you. That&rsquo;s why you include the invitation.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Kat didn&rsquo;t know what I wanted! Even&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know what I want,&rdquo; Y/N admitted out loud, so close too tears. &ldquo;But&hellip;I&rsquo;m not doing this again, Harry. We&rsquo;ve put this life behind us, we need to keep on moving forward.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What if I tell you I can&rsquo;t?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Y/N squeezed her eyes shut and turned away. She didn&rsquo;t want to look at him nor had him see her cry. And she wished he would just shut up and leave her like he&rsquo;d done years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, everything I&rsquo;ve&nbsp;done, everyone I&rsquo;ve been with in the past three years, could not help me forget about you&hellip;A-And&hellip;If I had to give up everything to change the past, I would. I just want it to be me and you against the world&hellip;This time I won&rsquo;t leave you alone.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Y/N shook her head with her eyes close. She touched his face, cupping his cheeks with both of her hands. Harry stayed motionless as&nbsp;he let the girl he loved run&nbsp;her thumbs across his cheeks, she was just trying to remember every feature on his face. Because she knew, the only place that she could see him again after tonight, was in her dreams.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not the same person anymore, and neither am I,&rdquo; she told him with a lump in her throat.&nbsp;&ldquo;Told you I&rsquo;d always love you, didn&rsquo;t I? No matter&hellip;&rdquo; Her voice cracked and the tears started streaming down on her face.&nbsp;&ldquo;No matter whom I end up with&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, petal, don&rsquo;t say that.&nbsp;Come with me, and we&rsquo;ll start over again. I-I already finished my tour, I could spend more time with you now. I would take care of you.&rdquo; Harry didn&rsquo;t even know what he was talking about anymore, words just constantly slipping out from his lips because he would say anything just to convince her to come back to him.&nbsp;&ldquo;We belong together&hellip;You know it. That should be me at the alter, not him.&rdquo;</p><p>He was holding both of her hands, which were still holding his face. It&rsquo;s the first time they&rsquo;d&nbsp;cried together since the night he left. He truly didn&rsquo;t want to face the same ending twice.</p><p>&ldquo;I wanted that to be you.&rdquo; Y/N smiled, though she was crying, she put on a smile for him.&nbsp;&ldquo;I wanted to marry you. I wanted us to have kids and to hear you say&nbsp;&lsquo;Baby, I&rsquo;m home&rsquo; every single night. But that&rsquo;s not how it would be if we&rsquo;d stayed together, I&rsquo;m never going to get that life. One day you&rsquo;re here, the next day you&rsquo;re not. We couldn&rsquo;t hold on back then, do you actually think it would be different this time?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It would.&rdquo; He nodded his head fast.&nbsp;&ldquo;One year after our breakup, I came back to find you, I did. They said you sold our house and you moved away. I didn&rsquo;t know where to look for you.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You came back for me?&rdquo; Her eyebrows puckered as the words leaving her mouth were full of breath.</p><p>&ldquo;I would always do,&rdquo; he said.<br /></p><p>They let silence took over again. And maybe that was the answer for Harry tonight. She still loved him, but she wouldn&rsquo;t come back. And even though it killed him to leave for the second time with nothing left inside but a beating heart, he wished her happiness, and a joyful life, and a wonderful wedding.</p><p>But when he got to the front door, her voice pulled him right back.</p><p>&ldquo;I have a question,&rdquo; she said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he replied.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;d&nbsp;found out about the wedding without receiving my letters, would you&nbsp;still have come tonight?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>It didn&rsquo;t take him more than a second to give her his answer,&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, Y/N, I would.&rdquo;</p><p>When the sound of Harry&rsquo;s footsteps faded away to silence in the empty hallway, on the floor, Y/N was already a broken mess.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Ready to go?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Receiving just a nod as an answer, Harry&rsquo;s manager,&nbsp;Jeff, told the driver to take them to the airport.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s suddenly question got Jeff by surprise. The older man hurriedly&nbsp;checked the watch on his left wrist before telling his friend it was 10 AM.</p><p><i>So it&rsquo;s now official</i>, Harry told himself. The girl he loved had officially become someone else&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp;</p><p>He turned his face to the window, ignoring Jeff repeatedly asking him if he was alright. Normally he would fake a smile and said he couldn&rsquo;t be better, but he couldn&rsquo;t do it now when the pain was too much to bear.&nbsp;</p><p>Harry got out of the car and got on his private jet at around 11 AM. His next stop was Italy. Jeff was reading the schedule for this entire day to Harry but all the young man could hear was a muffled sound in the background. And all he could think about was her, and the things she&rsquo;d&nbsp;said, how she&rsquo;d&nbsp;looked, how he&rsquo;d never see her again.&nbsp;</p><p>He&rsquo;d lived a life without her before, he certainly could do it again, he told himself that. But the last time he&rsquo;d left, he&rsquo;d been hoping for a better future for the two of them, this time, he had nowhere to place his faith. What was he going to do now that he knew they would never have another shot with each other?</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, your phone!&rdquo; Jeff&rsquo;s voice pulled Harry out from his pile of thoughts and he saw an unknown caller ID on the screen of his phone. He answered it anyway because of a strange feeling at the bottom of his chest. And Harry couldn&rsquo;t be more glad he&rsquo;d picked up that call.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, it&rsquo;s Kat!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kat, hey&hellip;Why&rsquo;d you call?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Y/N called off the wedding for good. She was on her way to you, everyone at home is freaking out at the moment.&nbsp;I tried to call you but you had your phone turned off!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, where are you going?!&rdquo; Jeff desperately called after his client, who tossed his phone somewhere on the floor and ran off the plane, without looking back for even half a second.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Fuck his schedule.&nbsp;</p><p>Fuck Italy.&nbsp;</p><p>He had to come back for her.&nbsp;</p><p>&hellip;</p><p><br /></p><p>Y/N sat on Harry&rsquo;s doorstep, patiently waiting for him to come home. She&rsquo;d tried ringing the doorbell but nobody answered and she didn&rsquo;t have his number.&nbsp;So all she could do now was wait here, with her make up and hair perfectly done, only missing the wedding dress.&nbsp;</p><p>She wished she wasn&rsquo;t too late, but she&rsquo;d been waiting for almost an hour now. So Y/N told herself if he didn&rsquo;t come back in one hour more, she would accept her faith, return home, and face the music. It turned out, fortunately, she didn&rsquo;t have to, because&nbsp;Harry showed up just in time.&nbsp;</p><p>It was half past twelve when Harry stepped out of the yellow taxi and his heart stopped when he saw Y/N standing outside his door. Without saying a single word, they both ran towards each other, her arms wrapped around his neck and his around her waist.</p><p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;&ldquo;It has to be you.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Harry felt exactly the same, all of his broken pieces had fallen back together. He cupped her cheeks and kissed her hard on the mouth with everything he had to give. All of the feelings he&rsquo;d kept aside those three years were delivered in that one long, passionate, last first kiss.&nbsp;</p><p>When they finally pulled apart, he laid kisses all over her face, her cheeks, her eyes, her forehead, her nose, to make up for the long period of time when he didn&rsquo;t even know where and how she&rsquo;d been, for the many times they&rsquo;d hurt and healed each other.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, you know that right?&rdquo; he breathed while resting his forehead against Y/N&rsquo;s.&nbsp;She bit her bottom lip to hold back a grin then nodded her head yes.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I love you too, Harry. Always have, always will.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>His heart could burst with joy and it would be the last thing he cared about.</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip;&rdquo; Harry trailed off as he gently tucked her hair behind her ears to take a better look at her pretty face. And he was so wrong to think the butterflies in his stomach were all dead.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you gonna write me letters again?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Only if you&rsquo;ll write them back.&rdquo; She smiled, staring at his lips.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, baby,&rdquo; he said before pulling her close for another kiss.&nbsp;&ldquo;I will write you thousands.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p></p>",

In exact eight hours more, Y/N was supposed to be walking down the aisle to marry the man she loved. But instead of sleeping safe and sound in bed, she was running around her apartment, desperately searching for a green box which was supposed to be at the back of her closet where no one else would find.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t touched it in weeks! How could it just disappear?!&rdquo; Y/N exclaimed between shallow breaths. </p>\n<p>Her maid of honor, Rosy, whom she was on the phone with, let out another heavy sigh. Rosy just assumed that her best friend was having a pre-wedding crisis, so calmly, she told the bride-to-be to just take a deep breath, go to bed, and save her energy for her big day.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Do as I say, Y/N, and I&rsquo;ll help you look for it tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;No, that box is important to me!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Does losing it in some ways affect your wedding?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;No&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s not important, Y/N!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t to Rosy, but to Y/N it was, and it made her feel guilty thinking that right now her box of letters was even more important than her wedding and future altogether. Those letters contained most of her youth, they were all the things nobody else knew except for herself. The last thing she would want was her friends, family, or her fianc&eacute; to find out she&rsquo;d been writing letters throughout the years to this one boy named Harry Styles. What was worse, if Harry himself ever received those letters, she could not imagine the consequences.</p>\n</p>",
