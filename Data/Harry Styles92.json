He had pulled the sleeves of his jumper over his hands, which was something he only did when he was feeling down. Losing in the video you had filmed earlier was getting to him and he was really anxious about what he would think.</p><p>\u201cH, are you okay?\u201d You ask, grabbing onto one of his covered hands. \u201cI just, I feel so stupid for not being the one to win that competition. I know it was just a game for your Channel, but I feel like shit. I feel like I should know you better than that. Those questions I got wrong were questions I should have known the answer to. And I get it if you\u2019re upset with me, or are annoyed that I didn\u2019t know them\u201d He said, trying to avoid your eye contact. </p><p>\u201cHarry Styles. Don\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d You start, making him look at you. \u201cYou are more than perfect. To be fair, the questions that you got wrong were questions that Gemma would have known because they happened before I met you. I love you incredibly, and the fact that you got two questions wrong doesn\u2019t bother me at all. I know that you know me well and that you love me more than anything. Don\u2019t let this get to you, please.\u201d You say, embracing him in a tight hug. Harry began rubbing circles into the small of your back, holding you close against his chest. </p><p>\u201cI love you so much\u201d He whispered, barely being able to hear him. You pulled away to look at him, and he smashed his lips against yours into a loving kiss. The kiss was interrupted by the doorbell. \u201cPizza\u2019s here. Somebody should probably get that\u201d You whispered, pecking his lips once more before answering the door. </p>",

You and Gemma have known each other for six years now after meeting at a convention for a campaign that you were both very passionate about and have clicked ever since. You met her brother, your now boyfriend, Harry when your flight was delayed to go back home to visit your family due to bad weather conditions. And the rest is history. </p>[[MORE]]<p>The video was a \u2018Who is the better Styles\u2019!\u2019 and it was one of your most requested videos. You asked Gemma and Harry a series of questions to see who knew you better. The final score was 6-4 to Gemma. </p><p>\u201cI feel so embarrassed to lose a game about how well I know my girlfriend\u201d Harry joked during the video, wrapping you in his arms as you finished up your video. \u201cIf you would like to see Harry in more videos where I promise he\u2019ll win and we\u2019ll inflate his ego, please like and subscribe and I\u2019ll see you all in the next time!\u201d You say and shut the camera off. </p><p>Once you had filmed the video and Harry stayed with you at your apartment to spend the night. Gemma had gone home. You had ordered a pizza to be delivered and you were flicking through the TV channels to find something to watch while you wait. </p><p>\u201cHey Y/N?\u201d Harry said, shifting his entire body so he could look at you. He had pulled the sleeves of his jumper over his hands, which was something he only did when he was feeling down. Losing in the video you had filmed earlier was getting to him and he was really anxious about what he would think.</p><p>\u201cH, are you okay?\u201d You ask, grabbing onto one of his covered hands. \u201cI just, I feel so stupid for not being the one to win that competition. I know it was just a game for your Channel, but I feel like shit. I feel like I should know you better than that. Those questions I got wrong were questions I should have known the answer to. And I get it if you\u2019re upset with me, or are annoyed that I didn\u2019t know them\u201d He said, trying to avoid your eye contact. </p><p>\u201cHarry Styles. Don\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d You start, making him look at you. \u201cYou are more than perfect. To be fair, the questions that you got wrong were questions that Gemma would have known because they happened before I met you. I love you incredibly, and the fact that you got two questions wrong doesn\u2019t bother me at all. I know that you know me well and that you love me more than anything. Don\u2019t let this get to you, please.\u201d You say, embracing him in a tight hug. Harry began rubbing circles into the small of your back, holding you close against his chest. </p><p>\u201cI love you so much\u201d He whispered, barely being able to hear him. You pulled away to look at him, and he smashed his lips against yours into a loving kiss. The kiss was interrupted by the doorbell. \u201cPizza\u2019s here. Somebody should probably get that\u201d You whispered, pecking his lips once more before answering the door. </p>",

Her paws pry against Y/N&rsquo;s forearms and she trips a bit from the crevices of the couch on her way to Harry&rsquo;s right arm which was perched on the armchair. Evie kitten licks his wrist to grab his attention even though his green eyes were already watching the pets&rsquo; every move. When Harry fails to react on time, Evie uses her claws to lightly scratch the surface of his skin.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Oww, Evie don&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo;</i>&nbsp;Harry retorts, finger pointing at the cat&rsquo;s direction to reprimand her. </p><p>Evie stares at him in silence, tongue poking out to lick its nose while Harry stared back; determined to not let the animal win the stare-off. Y/N scratches her hair, watching the scene in front of her. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Meow</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>That&rsquo;s right, you better say sorry,</i>&rdquo; Harry says, folding his arms across his chest in an effort to make himself look tougher. <i>&ldquo;I feed you, I give you a home to live in,&rdquo;</i></p><p>Y/N watches in amusement as her boyfriend continues on with his rant. </p><p><i>&ldquo;I buy your toy mice, I even pay god knows how much for your kitty daycare and your spa days!&rdquo;</i></p><p>Evie gawks at him, meowing every now and then as if she was acknowledging Harry&rsquo;s complaints. </p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Harry, I think she gets it,&rdquo;</i></b> Y/N&rsquo;s gentle voice speaks out, her hand patting Evie&rsquo;s head softly. </p><p><i>&ldquo;And that onesie, you&rsquo;ll be cold without it,</i>&rdquo; He shakes his head while tilting his chin up.&nbsp;&lsquo;<i>It&rsquo;s a good thing me and your mum, Y/N, love you so much,&rdquo;</i></p><p>Evie lets out a series of meows before jumping on the armrest, sitting on his forearm and curls herself up on his body. Y/N could see Harry&rsquo;s eyes soften at the sight, and even more when the cat lays its head and starts rubbing his skin. The purrs she lets out makes Harry coo at the adorable pet his mum had given him. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Awww, you always know how to make me feel bad, don&rsquo;t ya Evie?</i>&rdquo; His large hand raises to pet her, but Y/N&rsquo;s warning glance reminds him to be a little soft on his touch. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s a good little kitty?&rdquo;</i> Harry says, using baby talk that makes Y/N so endeared with the boy in front of her. <i>&ldquo;You are. Evie&rsquo;s a good kitty,&rdquo;</i></p><p>He lifts the cats&rsquo; body up to cradle between his arms while he wiggles his brows to Y/N to direct her to scooch down a bit so he had space on the couch. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she a good kitty, Y/N?&rdquo;</i> He raises Evie up to Y/N&rsquo;s line of sight. All she could see was the felines&rsquo; large eyes staring right back at her.
