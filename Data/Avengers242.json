He straightened Tony\u2019s arms out in front of him and put his own hands on top of Tony\u2019s upward-facing flat ones. \u201cTony, push against my hands,\u201d he instructed, sighing in relief when he was met with equal resistance on both sides.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d Steve asked, already hovering. He handed Clint a water bottle from the refrigerator, because water always helped, right? Thor returned from the front with now-solemn posture. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve alerted the pilot of a need to land as soon as possible,\u201d he said softly, and apparently Tony had skipped the scene in which Clint had gone to medical school and the others had become first-responders, or more likely he\u2019d zoned out again through the Avengers panic-planning a best-guess response. </p><p>\u201cDoes your head hurt again?\u201d Clint asked, his voice low and close to Tony\u2019s ear. It did, so he said so. \u201cDamn,\u201d Clint cursed, \u201ca migraine?\u201d</p><p>It hadn\u2019t really occurred even to Tony, in his migraine-muddled brain, but that was exactly what was happening. He gave a thumbs up, then held up nine fingers and Clint\u2019s eyes went wide. He\u2019d never seen Tony admit to past a six or a seven on the pain scale, so he must be in really bad shape. </p><p>Steve came back with an airplane eye mask to block out the light. </p><p>\u201cCan we not call Dr. Strange?\u201d Thor asked, distressed by the whimper Tony let out when Clint tried to move his head just enough to get the mask on. \u201cHe can teleport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but we\u2019re moving, so unless he times it perfectly, he\u2019ll end up getting ground into sausage in the jet engines,\u201d Clint pointed out, and Tony grimaced. </p><p>\u201cCan we not?\u201d he asked, barely managing to separate his words enough to be intelligible. </p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Clint apologized sheepishly. \u201cYou have any of your pain meds on the jet?\u201d</p><p>Tony wanted to roll his eyes, but that was a bad idea, and they wouldn\u2019t be able to see him anyway (not that that would normally stop him). \u201cYeah, I\u2019m an addictive personality who keeps opioids in his work vehicle,\u201d he snapped. A bit of clarity was beginning to come to him with the marginal relief from the darkness, but now he was bitchy.</p><p>\u201cWell when you phrase it like that, it sounds EXACTLY like something you\u2019d do,\u201d Clint snarked back, earning a middle finger from Tony. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll land soon, anyway,\u201d Steve intervened, \u201cand I\u2019ll make sure SHIELD has something waiting for him. </p><p>\u201cGotta be IV,\u201d Tony added, \u201cotherwise it\u2019ll come back up.\u201d</p><p>Steve nodded and included that information in his text to Fury, then helped Tony to recline his seat and took the ice pack Thor had found and pressed it to Tony\u2019s hand, where he wedged it behind his neck.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he breathed, and though he was too tired to express it, it was aimed toward all of them.</p><p>\u201cJust get some sleep,\u201d Clint instructed, \u201cand warn us next time.\u201d </p><p>Tony would try. </p>",

You were walking through the park as you had been kicked out of the appartment by your now ex boyfriend. You actually were relieved. The last few months he abused the hell out of you. He actually raped you, hit you, kicked you. When he didn&rsquo;t like the food you would cook, he would even lay your hand on the hot pan, burning it. You looked at the scar at the inside of your hand and clenched your fist. How could you be so stupid to stay with the guy?! Finally today you saw the light and told him how you were thinking. Ofcourse he didn&rsquo;t like it and beat the crap out of you. So right now you were sitting on a bench, in the snow, in only a thick sweater. However, the cold made the bruises a little less painfull. You touched your eye, which was a deep purple by now and winced. That did hurt more than you expected. You now did start to feel cold and tried to think of where you could go. Maybe Wanda? Well, you thought she would be out or busy with Vision. Maybe Pietro? You sighed. That would be so awkward. You had a thing for him for so long now and you couldn&rsquo;t bare to be around him, without touching him. You always thought he didn&rsquo;t feel the same, which was the reason you started something with your ex, not knowing what you were up to. You took your phone out and looked up his number. Though you hasitated to call him. Something was pulling you towards him, but at the same time, you didn&rsquo;t want to disturb him. He was a ladies man and liked to flirt. Maybe he was with some girl right now. After all it had been months since you two last spoke. You bit your lip and pushed the call button, before bringing your phone to your ear. </p><p>\n&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; Pietro said when answering the call. You felt a little warmer by just hearing his voice. &ldquo;H-hi, it&rsquo;s me..&rdquo; you whispered. &ldquo;y/n? Is that you?&rdquo; he asked. You shivered at his accent. You always had a weakness for that. &ldquo;Y-yeah.&rdquo; you simply replied. &ldquo;Are you okay? You never call without a reason, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; he asked, worry sounding in his voice. Finally you broke down crying and sobbing. &ldquo;He&hellip;I&hellip;&rdquo; you tried to speak, but the crying was just too much. &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; he asked sternly. &ldquo;Park.&rdquo; you whimpered. The next thing you heard was him hanging up. You put your phone away, thinking he didn&rsquo;t even wanna talk you to. You buried your face into your hands and kept on crying loudly, not caring if anyone would hear you. Even though it was dark outside and it was late, there were still people everywhere. A wind suddenly went across you and you shivered, wrapping your arms around yourself. When you looked up, you saw a blue hue, gasping as you recognized it right away. Then Pietro stopped right in front of you, kneeling down. &ldquo;What happened to you?!&rdquo; he nearly yelled. You turned your head and looked away. Right now your eyes were red and puffy, along with the black eye. He laid his hand under your chin, pulling it in his direction, making you look at him. You looked into those blue eyes and bit your lips. &ldquo;What did he do to you?&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;H-he hit me&hellip;&rdquo; you whimpered softly. Pietro balled his fists. He then sighed, trying to calm himself down and sat beside you. &ldquo;Are you cold?&rdquo; he asked. You nodded. Immediately he took off his coat and wrapped it around you and took you in his arms. &ldquo;Tell me everything, <i>printsessa</i>.&rdquo; he said softly. You smiled softly at the old nickname he gave you and felt a little better already. </p><p>\n&ldquo;The last few months he started to become agressive. At first he would only hit me occasionally. Then he would throw me around the house, off the stairs of lock me up in the bathroom or basement. Then he started burning me with his cigarettes or he would burn my hands on the pans I was cooking in. And the last few days he kept on hitting me several times a day and caused bruises all over my body. And a few minutes ago he hit my eye after I told him off and he should stop. Then he threw me out and I have nowhere to go.&rdquo; you told and started crying again. You could hear how Pietro&rsquo;s nostrils were flared and how he was grunting in anger. He held your close and rocked you back and forth. Finally you calmed down and sighed. &ldquo;So tired..&rdquo; you whispered. He stood up and picked you up in his arms bridal style. You leaned your head into the crook of his neck and then everything was a blur. Everything you saw was a blue flash and before you knew it you were being laid on his bed. You blinker in surprise. &ldquo;Pietro, I can&rsquo;t ask you for this.&rdquo; you said softly, but did curl up into the covers. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to, Printsessa. Stay as long as you need. Or better, live here.&rdquo; he said, his accent a little thicker as he seemed nervous. You looked at him with wide eyes. &ldquo;But..&rdquo; you said, but were interrupted by him. &ldquo;Just stay. I will protect you from that <i>pridurok.</i>&rdquo; he said. You nodded. &ldquo;Please, join me?&rdquo; you asked timidly. You didn&rsquo;t want to be alone. &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; he asked and raised an eyebrow. You nodded again. He took off his shirt and you practically drooled at the sight. Hell, you stopped loving your ex months ago, so it felt good to be in love again after all this shit. He joined you under the covers and laid behind you. You crawled backwards, till your body hit his and he wrapped his arms around you. You didn&rsquo;t dare looking at him right now, as your heart was going crazy. &ldquo;Goodnight, Pietro. Thank you so much.&rdquo; you whispered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, <i>Printsessa. Vse budet v poryadke.</i> Everything will be alright.&rdquo; he answered. With that you fell asleep at his warmth and the masculine smell of him on his pillows. </p><p>\nThe next morning you were waking up as the sun was shining through the window. You squinted as it was extra bright due to the snow. You looked around and remembered where you were. You smiled brightly and looked around, seeing Pietro still asleep. You turned around carefully as he still had his arms around you. He looked so peaceful. You kept smiling and reached up to softly caress his cheek with your fingertips. Even though it had a scruff, it was still so soft. You looked at his lips and couldn&rsquo;t help but imagine how it would be to feel them against your own. You softly cupped his cheek and caressed his lower lip with your thumg. Your own lips parted in surprise at how soft it felt. You felt your cheeks heat up. You sighed. &ldquo;God, how was I so stupid? I wish I could tell you how much I love you. Then I didn&rsquo;t have to end up with that jerk..&rdquo; you whispered, barely audible. &ldquo;Then tell me.&rdquo; he said groggily, his eyes still closed. You gasped as he startled you slightly and pulled back your hand. He then opened his eyes and looked at you. You were at a loss for words. The sight of his half lidded eyes, just had you silent. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pull back. I like the touch.&rdquo; he said softly and took your hand to put it back where it was. You blushed and he smiled softly. &ldquo;You want to feel them, no?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;H-huh?&rdquo; you sounded confusedly. &ldquo;My lips.&rdquo; he answered. He still had his eyes boring into yours. &ldquo;Is it that obvious?&rdquo; you giggled, trying to hide your embarrasment. &ldquo;Well, if you wake me with doing that and touching them, then yes.&rdquo; he said in a low voice. Your heart fluttered at the sound of it. Never had you been able to hear him speak when he just woke up. Boy, did he sound dreamy. You bit your lower lip and nodded. &ldquo;Please?&rdquo; you asked. He chuckled a bit and sat up a little to lean on his elbow, before leaning forward and molding his lips into yours. You gasped at the feel and you felt all of your nerves being on fire. Slowly he entered his tongue to let it dance with yours and reached up to let his hand rest in your neck. You moaned slightly as the kiss was so passionate. You wrapped your arms around his neck.</p><p>\nRight now both of your bodies were acting on their own. He rolled on top of you and laid down between your legs, never pulling back from the kiss. Your hands reached up to braid your fingers into his hair. You pulled softly and he groaned. Suddenly he rolled his hips, making you moan out. He finally pulled back as the two of you were barely able to breathe anymore. He started nipping your neck and collarbone as you pushed down his sweats. You then reached for his dick and wrapped your hand around it, pumping it slowly. He moaned into your skin, causing you to shiver. You wiped his precum all over the tip with your thumb and put your mouth to use the same as he did. You both pulled back only for a second to undo the rest of the agitating clothes. Then you were in the same position once more. No words were said. Just actions. He laid the covers over his back as he lined himself up, not wanting you to be cold. You couldn\u00b4t help but marvel at how sweet he was being. He gave you a blinding smile and kissed the tip of your nose, making you giggle. He wrapped his arm around your leg, pushing it up as he leaned of the free one. Slowly he pushed in and groaned at the friction. You moaned out his name and gripped the sheets. When he was burried fully, you rolled your hips. He got the hint and moved right away. He set a good rythm, not too slow, not to fast. A heated kiss followed as your bodies moved as one. This was perfect. You never had this with anyone before. You felt in pure bliss and more was to come. You felt his thrusts gaining force, however the speed stayed the same. Who knew this speedster could take it more slowly? The room now was filled with skin, slapping on skin, groans and grunts from Pietro and moans and gasps from you. Suddenly you cried out as he hit that very special spot inside of you. He grinned and you widened your eyes. What the hell was that? &ldquo;W-what was that? D-do that again.&rdquo; you moaned and looked at him. He stilled for a moment and looked at you in surprise. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; you asked and blinked in confusion. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me noone has ever hit that spot before.&rdquo; he panted. You blushed and looked down. &ldquo;Oh, <i>dragoste&hellip;</i> I am going to make you feel so good.&rdquo; he moaned and started thrusting again. This time he kept slamming your g-spot over and over again at a rapid speed. Your moans turned significantly louder and smiled at the sounds. He bent forward to whisper sweet nothings into your ear. Some Russian, some English. You arched your back as you felt dangerously close. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, <i>printsessa.</i> Cum with me.&rdquo; Pietro moaned and his hips were stuttering. &ldquo;Pietro, yes! Ahhh, take me with you!&rdquo; you cried out and screamed his name as you fell over the edge, followed right behind by him as you felt him fire his sweet cum all over your insides. </p><p>\nHe slowly rolled his hips, riding out your orgasms and pulled out. He laid back down and took you in his arms as he watched you. &ldquo;I love you too, y/n. Never forget that. Do forget about the past. I am here now. And I will stay forever. You are mine now, <i>printsessa.</i>&rdquo; You blushed deeply and giggled. &ldquo;I will do my best to forget the past, my love. And I will stay with you forever too. I am all yours as you are mine.&rdquo; you said softly and kissed his cheek. &ldquo;Good. Now, let&rsquo;s go eat.&rdquo; he chuckled.

You were walking through the park as you had been kicked out of the appartment by your now ex boyfriend. You actually were relieved. The last few months he abused the hell out of you. He actually raped you, hit you, kicked you. When he didn\u2019t like the food you would cook, he would even lay your hand on the hot pan, burning it. You looked at the scar at the inside of your hand and clenched your fist. How could you be so stupid to stay with the guy?! Finally today you saw the light and told him how you were thinking. Ofcourse he didn\u2019t like it and beat the crap out of you. So right now you were sitting on a bench, in the snow, in only a thick sweater. However, the cold made the bruises a little less painfull. You touched your eye, which was a deep purple by now and winced. That did hurt more than you expected. You now did start to feel cold and tried to think of where you could go. Maybe Wanda? Well, you thought she would be out or busy with Vision. Maybe Pietro? You sighed. That would be so awkward. You had a thing for him for so long now and you couldn\u2019t bare to be around him, without touching him. You always thought he didn\u2019t feel the same, which was the reason you started something with your ex, not knowing what you were up to. You took your phone out and looked up his number. Though you hasitated to call him. Something was pulling you towards him, but at the same time, you didn\u2019t want to disturb him. He was a ladies man and liked to flirt. Maybe he was with some girl right now. After all it had been months since you two last spoke. You bit your lip and pushed the call button, before bringing your phone to your ear. </p><p>\n\u201cHello?\u201d Pietro said when answering the call. You felt a little warmer by just hearing his voice. \u201cH-hi, it\u2019s me..\u201d you whispered. \u201cy/n? Is that you?\u201d he asked. You shivered at his accent. You always had a weakness for that. \u201cY-yeah.\u201d you simply replied. \u201cAre you okay? You never call without a reason, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked, worry sounding in his voice. Finally you broke down crying and sobbing. \u201cHe\u2026I\u2026\u201d you tried to speak, but the crying was just too much. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d he asked sternly. \u201cPark.\u201d you whimpered. The next thing you heard was him hanging up. You put your phone away, thinking he didn\u2019t even wanna talk you to. You buried your face into your hands and kept on crying loudly, not caring if anyone would hear you. Even though it was dark outside and it was late, there were still people everywhere. A wind suddenly went across you and you shivered, wrapping your arms around yourself. When you looked up, you saw a blue hue, gasping as you recognized it right away. Then Pietro stopped right in front of you, kneeling down. \u201cWhat happened to you?!\u201d he nearly yelled. You turned your head and looked away. Right now your eyes were red and puffy, along with the black eye. He laid his hand under your chin, pulling it in his direction, making you look at him. You looked into those blue eyes and bit your lips. \u201cWhat did he do to you?\u201d he growled. \u201cH-he hit me\u2026\u201d you whimpered softly. Pietro balled his fists. He then sighed, trying to calm himself down and sat beside you. \u201cAre you cold?\u201d he asked. You nodded. Immediately he took off his coat and wrapped it around you and took you in his arms. \u201cTell me everything, <i>printsessa</i>.\u201d he said softly. You smiled softly at the old nickname he gave you and felt a little better already. </p><p>\n\u201cThe last few months he started to become agressive. At first he would only hit me occasionally. Then he would throw me around the house, off the stairs of lock me up in the bathroom or basement. Then he started burning me with his cigarettes or he would burn my hands on the pans I was cooking in. And the last few days he kept on hitting me several times a day and caused bruises all over my body. And a few minutes ago he hit my eye after I told him off and he should stop. Then he threw me out and I have nowhere to go.\u201d you told and started crying again. You could hear how Pietro\u2019s nostrils were flared and how he was grunting in anger. He held your close and rocked you back and forth. Finally you calmed down and sighed. \u201cSo tired..\u201d you whispered. He stood up and picked you up in his arms bridal style. You leaned your head into the crook of his neck and then everything was a blur. Everything you saw was a blue flash and before you knew it you were being laid on his bed. You blinker in surprise. \u201cPietro, I can\u2019t ask you for this.\u201d you said softly, but did curl up into the covers. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to, Printsessa. Stay as long as you need. Or better, live here.\u201d he said, his accent a little thicker as he seemed nervous. You looked at him with wide eyes. \u201cBut..\u201d you said, but were interrupted by him. \u201cJust stay. I will protect you from that <i>pridurok.</i>\u201d he said. You nodded. \u201cPlease, join me?\u201d you asked timidly. You didn\u2019t want to be alone. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d he asked and raised an eyebrow. You nodded again. He took off his shirt and you practically drooled at the sight. Hell, you stopped loving your ex months ago, so it felt good to be in love again after all this shit. He joined you under the covers and laid behind you. You crawled backwards, till your body hit his and he wrapped his arms around you. You didn\u2019t dare looking at him right now, as your heart was going crazy. \u201cGoodnight, Pietro. Thank you so much.\u201d you whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, <i>Printsessa. Vse budet v poryadke.</i> Everything will be alright.\u201d he answered. With that you fell asleep at his warmth and the masculine smell of him on his pillows. </p><p>\nThe next morning you were waking up as the sun was shining through the window. You squinted as it was extra bright due to the snow. You looked around and remembered where you were. You smiled brightly and looked around, seeing Pietro still asleep. You turned around carefully as he still had his arms around you. He looked so peaceful. You kept smiling and reached up to softly caress his cheek with your fingertips. Even though it had a scruff, it was still so soft. You looked at his lips and couldn\u2019t help but imagine how it would be to feel them against your own. You softly cupped his cheek and caressed his lower lip with your thumg. Your own lips parted in surprise at how soft it felt. You felt your cheeks heat up. You sighed. \u201cGod, how was I so stupid? I wish I could tell you how much I love you. Then I didn\u2019t have to end up with that jerk..\u201d you whispered, barely audible. \u201cThen tell me.\u201d he said groggily, his eyes still closed. You gasped as he startled you slightly and pulled back your hand. He then opened his eyes and looked at you. You were at a loss for words. The sight of his half lidded eyes, just had you silent. \u201cDon\u2019t pull back. I like the touch.\u201d he said softly and took your hand to put it back where it was. You blushed and he smiled softly. \u201cYou want to feel them, no?\u201d he asked. \u201cH-huh?\u201d you sounded confusedly. \u201cMy lips.\u201d he answered. He still had his eyes boring into yours. \u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d you giggled, trying to hide your embarrasment. \u201cWell, if you wake me with doing that and touching them, then yes.\u201d he said in a low voice. Your heart fluttered at the sound of it. Never had you been able to hear him speak when he just woke up. Boy, did he sound dreamy. You bit your lower lip and nodded. \u201cPlease?\u201d you asked. He chuckled a bit and sat up a little to lean on his elbow, before leaning forward and molding his lips into yours. You gasped at the feel and you felt all of your nerves being on fire. Slowly he entered his tongue to let it dance with yours and reached up to let his hand rest in your neck. You moaned slightly as the kiss was so passionate. You wrapped your arms around his neck.</p><p>\nRight now both of your bodies were acting on their own. He rolled on top of you and laid down between your legs, never pulling back from the kiss. Your hands reached up to braid your fingers into his hair. You pulled softly and he groaned. Suddenly he rolled his hips, making you moan out. He finally pulled back as the two of you were barely able to breathe anymore. He started nipping your neck and collarbone as you pushed down his sweats. You then reached for his dick and wrapped your hand around it, pumping it slowly. He moaned into your skin, causing you to shiver. You wiped his precum all over the tip with your thumb and put your mouth to use the same as he did. You both pulled back only for a second to undo the rest of the agitating clothes. Then you were in the same position once more. No words were said. Just actions. He laid the covers over his back as he lined himself up, not wanting you to be cold. You couldn\u00b4t help but marvel at how sweet he was being. He gave you a blinding smile and kissed the tip of your nose, making you giggle. He wrapped his arm around your leg, pushing it up as he leaned of the free one. Slowly he pushed in and groaned at the friction. You moaned out his name and gripped the sheets. When he was burried fully, you rolled your hips. He got the hint and moved right away. He set a good rythm, not too slow, not to fast. A heated kiss followed as your bodies moved as one. This was perfect. You never had this with anyone before. You felt in pure bliss and more was to come. You felt his thrusts gaining force, however the speed stayed the same. Who knew this speedster could take it more slowly? The room now was filled with skin, slapping on skin, groans and grunts from Pietro and moans and gasps from you. Suddenly you cried out as he hit that very special spot inside of you. He grinned and you widened your eyes. What the hell was that? \u201cW-what was that? D-do that again.\u201d you moaned and looked at him. He stilled for a moment and looked at you in surprise. \u201cWhat?\u201d you asked and blinked in confusion. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me noone has ever hit that spot before.\u201d he panted. You blushed and looked down. \u201cOh, <i>dragoste\u2026</i> I am going to make you feel so good.\u201d he moaned and started thrusting again. This time he kept slamming your g-spot over and over again at a rapid speed. Your moans turned significantly louder and smiled at the sounds. He bent forward to whisper sweet nothings into your ear. Some Russian, some English. You arched your back as you felt dangerously close. \u201cThat\u2019s it, <i>printsessa.</i> Cum with me.\u201d Pietro moaned and his hips were stuttering. \u201cPietro, yes! Ahhh, take me with you!\u201d you cried out and screamed his name as you fell over the edge, followed right behind by him as you felt him fire his sweet cum all over your insides. </p><p>\nHe slowly rolled his hips, riding out your orgasms and pulled out. He laid back down and took you in his arms as he watched you. \u201cI love you too, y/n. Never forget that. Do forget about the past. I am here now. And I will stay forever. You are mine now, <i>printsessa.</i>\u201d You blushed deeply and giggled. \u201cI will do my best to forget the past, my love. And I will stay with you forever too. I am all yours as you are mine.\u201d you said softly and kissed his cheek. \u201cGood. Now, let\u2019s go eat.\u201d he chuckled. You nodded and he sped out of bed, not even bothering to dress up. You laughed as you saw the blue hue leave the room. That was your silly man.</p></p>",

You arched your back as you felt dangerously close. \u201cThat\u2019s it, <i>printsessa.</i> Cum with me.\u201d Pietro moaned and his hips were stuttering. \u201cPietro, yes! Ahhh, take me with you!\u201d you cried out and screamed his name as you fell over the edge, followed right behind by him as you felt him fire his sweet cum all over your insides. </p><p>\nHe slowly rolled his hips, riding out your orgasms and pulled out.

You were walking through the park as you had been kicked out of the appartment by your now ex boyfriend. You actually were relieved. The last few months he abused the hell out of you. He actually raped you, hit you, kicked you. When he didn&rsquo;t like the food you would cook, he would even lay your hand on the hot pan, burning it. You looked at the scar at the inside of your hand and clenched your fist. How could you be so stupid to stay with the guy?! Finally today you saw the light and told him how you were thinking. Ofcourse he didn&rsquo;t like it and beat the crap out of you. So right now you were sitting on a bench, in the snow, in only a thick sweater. However, the cold made the bruises a little less painfull. You touched your eye, which was a deep purple by now and winced. That did hurt more than you expected. You now did start to feel cold and tried to think of where you could go. Maybe Wanda? Well, you thought she would be out or busy with Vision. Maybe Pietro? You sighed. That would be so awkward. You had a thing for him for so long now and you couldn&rsquo;t bare to be around him, without touching him. You always thought he didn&rsquo;t feel the same, which was the reason you started something with your ex, not knowing what you were up to. You took your phone out and looked up his number. Though you hasitated to call him. Something was pulling you towards him, but at the same time, you didn&rsquo;t want to disturb him. He was a ladies man and liked to flirt. Maybe he was with some girl right now. After all it had been months since you two last spoke. You bit your lip and pushed the call button, before bringing your phone to your ear. </p><p>\n&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; Pietro said when answering the call. You felt a little warmer by just hearing his voice. &ldquo;H-hi, it&rsquo;s me..&rdquo; you whispered. &ldquo;y/n? Is that you?&rdquo; he asked. You shivered at his accent. You always had a weakness for that. &ldquo;Y-yeah.&rdquo; you simply replied. &ldquo;Are you okay? You never call without a reason, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; he asked, worry sounding in his voice. Finally you broke down crying and sobbing. &ldquo;He&hellip;I&hellip;&rdquo; you tried to speak, but the crying was just too much. &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; he asked sternly. &ldquo;Park.&rdquo; you whimpered. The next thing you heard was him hanging up. You put your phone away, thinking he didn&rsquo;t even wanna talk you to. You buried your face into your hands and kept on crying loudly, not caring if anyone would hear you. Even though it was dark outside and it was late, there were still people everywhere. A wind suddenly went across you and you shivered, wrapping your arms around yourself. When you looked up, you saw a blue hue, gasping as you recognized it right away. Then Pietro stopped right in front of you, kneeling down. &ldquo;What happened to you?!&rdquo; he nearly yelled. You turned your head and looked away. Right now your eyes were red and puffy, along with the black eye. He laid his hand under your chin, pulling it in his direction, making you look at him. You looked into those blue eyes and bit your lips. &ldquo;What did he do to you?&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;H-he hit me&hellip;&rdquo; you whimpered softly. Pietro balled his fists. He then sighed, trying to calm himself down and sat beside you. &ldquo;Are you cold?&rdquo; he asked. You nodded. Immediately he took off his coat and wrapped it around you and took you in his arms. &ldquo;Tell me everything, <i>printsessa</i>.&rdquo; he said softly. You smiled softly at the old nickname he gave you and felt a little better already. </p><p>\n&ldquo;The last few months he started to become agressive. At first he would only hit me occasionally. Then he would throw me around the house, off the stairs of lock me up in the bathroom or basement. Then he started burning me with his cigarettes or he would burn my hands on the pans I was cooking in. And the last few days he kept on hitting me several times a day and caused bruises all over my body. And a few minutes ago he hit my eye after I told him off and he should stop. Then he threw me out and I have nowhere to go.&rdquo; you told and started crying again. You could hear how Pietro&rsquo;s nostrils were flared and how he was grunting in anger. He held your close and rocked you back and forth. Finally you calmed down and sighed. &ldquo;So tired..&rdquo; you whispered. He stood up and picked you up in his arms bridal style. You leaned your head into the crook of his neck and then everything was a blur. Everything you saw was a blue flash and before you knew it you were being laid on his bed. You blinker in surprise. &ldquo;Pietro, I can&rsquo;t ask you for this.&rdquo; you said softly, but did curl up into the covers. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to, Printsessa. Stay as long as you need. Or better, live here.&rdquo; he said, his accent a little thicker as he seemed nervous. You looked at him with wide eyes. &ldquo;But..&rdquo; you said, but were interrupted by him. &ldquo;Just stay. I will protect you from that <i>pridurok.</i>&rdquo; he said. You nodded. &ldquo;Please, join me?&rdquo; you asked timidly. You didn&rsquo;t want to be alone. &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; he asked and raised an eyebrow. You nodded again. He took off his shirt and you practically drooled at the sight. Hell, you stopped loving your ex months ago, so it felt good to be in love again after all this shit. He joined you under the covers and laid behind you. You crawled backwards, till your body hit his and he wrapped his arms around you. You didn&rsquo;t dare looking at him right now, as your heart was going crazy. &ldquo;Goodnight, Pietro. Thank you so much.&rdquo; you whispered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, <i>Printsessa. Vse budet v poryadke.</i> Everything will be alright.&rdquo; he answered. With that you fell asleep at his warmth and the masculine smell of him on his pillows. </p><p>\nThe next morning you were waking up as the sun was shining through the window. You squinted as it was extra bright due to the snow. You looked around and remembered where you were. You smiled brightly and looked around, seeing Pietro still asleep. You turned around carefully as he still had his arms around you. He looked so peaceful. You kept smiling and reached up to softly caress his cheek with your fingertips. Even though it had a scruff, it was still so soft. You looked at his lips and couldn&rsquo;t help but imagine how it would be to feel them against your own. You softly cupped his cheek and caressed his lower lip with your thumg. Your own lips parted in surprise at how soft it felt. You felt your cheeks heat up. You sighed. &ldquo;God, how was I so stupid? I wish I could tell you how much I love you. Then I didn&rsquo;t have to end up with that jerk..&rdquo; you whispered, barely audible. &ldquo;Then tell me.&rdquo; he said groggily, his eyes still closed. You gasped as he startled you slightly and pulled back your hand. He then opened his eyes and looked at you. You were at a loss for words. The sight of his half lidded eyes, just had you silent. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pull back. I like the touch.&rdquo; he said softly and took your hand to put it back where it was. You blushed and he smiled softly. &ldquo;You want to feel them, no?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;H-huh?&rdquo; you sounded confusedly. &ldquo;My lips.&rdquo; he answered. He still had his eyes boring into yours. &ldquo;Is it that obvious?&rdquo; you giggled, trying to hide your embarrasment. &ldquo;Well, if you wake me with doing that and touching them, then yes.&rdquo; he said in a low voice. Your heart fluttered at the sound of it. Never had you been able to hear him speak when he just woke up. Boy, did he sound dreamy. You bit your lower lip and nodded. &ldquo;Please?&rdquo; you asked. He chuckled a bit and sat up a little to lean on his elbow, before leaning forward and molding his lips into yours. You gasped at the feel and you felt all of your nerves being on fire. Slowly he entered his tongue to let it dance with yours and reached up to let his hand rest in your neck. You moaned slightly as the kiss was so passionate. You wrapped your arms around his neck.</p><p>\nRight now both of your bodies were acting on their own. He rolled on top of you and laid down between your legs, never pulling back from the kiss. Your hands reached up to braid your fingers into his hair. You pulled softly and he groaned. Suddenly he rolled his hips, making you moan out. He finally pulled back as the two of you were barely able to breathe anymore. He started nipping your neck and collarbone as you pushed down his sweats. You then reached for his dick and wrapped your hand around it, pumping it slowly. He moaned into your skin, causing you to shiver. You wiped his precum all over the tip with your thumb and put your mouth to use the same as he did. You both pulled back only for a second to undo the rest of the agitating clothes. Then you were in the same position once more. No words were said. Just actions. He laid the covers over his back as he lined himself up, not wanting you to be cold. You couldn&acute;t help but marvel at how sweet he was being. He gave you a blinding smile and kissed the tip of your nose, making you giggle. He wrapped his arm around your leg, pushing it up as he leaned of the free one. Slowly he pushed in and groaned at the friction. You moaned out his name and gripped the sheets. When he was burried fully, you rolled your hips. He got the hint and moved right away. He set a good rythm, not too slow, not to fast. A heated kiss followed as your bodies moved as one. This was perfect. You never had this with anyone before. You felt in pure bliss and more was to come. You felt his thrusts gaining force, however the speed stayed the same. Who knew this speedster could take it more slowly? The room now was filled with skin, slapping on skin, groans and grunts from Pietro and moans and gasps from you. Suddenly you cried out as he hit that very special spot inside of you. He grinned and you widened your eyes. What the hell was that? &ldquo;W-what was that? D-do that again.&rdquo; you moaned and looked at him. He stilled for a moment and looked at you in surprise. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; you asked and blinked in confusion. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me noone has ever hit that spot before.&rdquo; he panted. You blushed and looked down. &ldquo;Oh, <i>dragoste&hellip;</i> I am going to make you feel so good.&rdquo; he moaned and started thrusting again. This time he kept slamming your g-spot over and over again at a rapid speed. Your moans turned significantly louder and smiled at the sounds. He bent forward to whisper sweet nothings into your ear. Some Russian, some English. You arched your back as you felt dangerously close. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, <i>printsessa.</i> Cum with me.&rdquo; Pietro moaned and his hips were stuttering. &ldquo;Pietro, yes! Ahhh, take me with you!&rdquo; you cried out and screamed his name as you fell over the edge, followed right behind by him as you felt him fire his sweet cum all over your insides. </p><p>\nHe slowly rolled his hips, riding out your orgasms and pulled out. He laid back down and took you in his arms as he watched you. &ldquo;I love you too, y/n. Never forget that. Do forget about the past. I am here now. And I will stay forever. You are mine now, <i>printsessa.</i>&rdquo; You blushed deeply and giggled. &ldquo;I will do my best to forget the past, my love. And I will stay with you forever too. I am all yours as you are mine.&rdquo; you said softly and kissed his cheek. &ldquo;Good. Now, let&rsquo;s go eat.&rdquo; he chuckled. You nodded and he sped out of bed, not even bothering to dress up. You laughed as you saw the blue hue leave the room. That was your silly man.</p></p>",
